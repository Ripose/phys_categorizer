BIFURCATION AND STABILITY OF TWO-DIMENSIONAL
DOUBLE-DIFFUSIVE CONVECTION

CHUN-HSIUNG HSIA, TIAN MA, AND SHOUHONG WANG

Abstract. In this article, we present a bifurcation and stability analysis on
the double-diﬀusive convection. The main objective is to study 1) the mech-
anism of the saddle-node bifurcation and hysteresis for the problem, 2) the
formation, stability and transitions of the typical convection structures, and
3) the stability of solutions. It is proved in particular that there are two diﬀer-
ent types of transitions: continuous and jump, which are determined explicitly
using some physical relevant nondimensional parameters. It is also proved that
the jump transition always leads to the existence of a saddle-node bifurcation
and hysteresis phenomena.

1. Introduction

Convective motions occur in a ﬂuid when there are density variations present.
Double-diﬀusive convection is the name given to such convective motions when the
density variations are caused by two diﬀerent components which have diﬀerent rates
of diﬀusion. Double-diﬀusion was ﬁrst originally discovered in the 1857 by Jevons
[4], forgotten, and then rediscovered as an “oceanographic curiosity” a century later;
see among others Stommel, Arons and Blanchard [12], Veronis [14], and Baines and
Gill [1]. In addition to its eﬀects on oceanic circulation, double-diﬀusion convection
has wide applications to such diverse ﬁelds as growing crystals, the dynamics of
magma chambers and convection in the sun.

The best known double-diﬀusive instabilities are “salt-ﬁngers” as discussed in
the pioneering work by Stern [11]. These arise when hot salty water lies over cold
fresh water of a higher density and consist of long ﬁngers of rising and sinking water.
A blob of hot salty water which ﬁnds itself surrounded by cold fresh water rapidly
loses its heat while retaining its salt due to the very diﬀerent rates of diﬀusion
of heat and salt. The blob becomes cold and salty and hence denser than the
surrounding ﬂuid. This tends to make the blob sink further, drawing down more
hot salty water from above giving rise to sinking ﬁngers of ﬂuid.

The main objective of this article is to develop a bifurcation and stability theory

for the double-diﬀusive convection, including

1) existence of bifurcations/transitions,
2) asymptotic stability of bifurcated solutions, and
3) the structure/patterns and their stability/transitions in the physical space.

The analysis is based on a bifurcation theory for nonlinear partial diﬀerential
equations and a geometric theory of two-dimensional (2D) incompressible ﬂows,
both developed recently by two of the authors; see respectively [7, 8] and [9] and
the references therein.

This bifurcation theory is centered at a new notion of bifurcation, called attractor
bifurcation for dynamical systems, both ﬁnite dimensional and inﬁnite dimensional.
The main ingredients of the theory include a) the attractor bifurcation theory, b)
steady state bifurcation for a class of nonlinear problems with even order non-
degenerate nonlinearities, regardless of the multiplicity of the eigenvalues, and c)
new strategies for the Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction and the center manifold reduc-
tion procedures. The bifurcation theory has been applied to various problems from
science and engineering, including, in particular, the Kuramoto-Sivashinshy equa-
tion, the Cahn-Hillard equation, the Ginzburg-Landau equation, Reaction-Diﬀusion
equations in Biology and Chemistry, the B´enard convection and the Taylor problem
in ﬂuid dynamics.

The geometric theory of 2D incompressible ﬂows was initiated by the authors
to study the structure and its stability and transitions of 2-D incompressible ﬂuid
ﬂows in the physical spaces. This program of study consists of research in direc-
tions: 1) the study of the structure and its transitions/evolutions of divergence-free
vector ﬁelds, and 2) the study of the structure and its transitions of velocity ﬁelds
for 2-D incompressible ﬂuid ﬂows governed by the Navier-Stokes equations or the
Euler equations. The study in Area 1) is more kinematic in nature, and the results
and methods developed can naturally be applied to other problems of mathematical
physics involving divergence-free vector ﬁelds. In ﬂuid dynamics context, the study
in Area 2) involves speciﬁc connections between the solutions of the Navier-Stokes
or the Euler equations and ﬂow structure in the physical space. In other words,
this area of research links the kinematics to the dynamics of ﬂuid ﬂows. This is
unquestionably an important and diﬃcult problem. Progresses have been made in
several directions. First, a new rigorous characterization of boundary layer sepa-
rations for 2D viscous incompressible ﬂows is developed recently by the authors,
in collaboration in part with Michael Ghil; see [9] and the references therein. An-
other example in this area is the structure (e.g. rolls) in the physical space in the
Rayleigh-B´enard convection, using the structural stability theorem developed in
Area 1) together with the application of the aforementioned bifurcation theory; see
[6, 9].

In this article, we consider two-dimensional double-diﬀusive convections mod-
elled by the Boussinesq equations with two diﬀusion equations of the temperature
and salinity functions. In comparison to the Rayleigh-B´enard convection case, and
the steady linearized problem around the basic state for the double-diﬀusive con-
vection is nonsymmetric. This leads to a much harder eigenvalue problem, and
consequently much more involved bifurcation and stability analysis. Hence, the
bifurcation and the ﬂow structure are much richer.

The central gravity of the analysis is the reduction of the problem to the center
manifold in the ﬁrst unstable eigendirections, based on an approximation formula
for the center manifold function. The key idea is to ﬁnd the approximation of the
reduction to certain order, leading to a “nondegenerate” system with higher order
perturbations. The full bifurcation and stability analysis are then carried out using

DOUBLE-DIFFUSIVE CONVECTION

a combination of the attractor bifurcation theory and the geometric theory of 2D
incompressible ﬂows.

We now address brieﬂy the main characteristics of the bifurcation and stability

analysis of the two-dimensional double-diﬀusive model presented in this article.

First, the double-diﬀusive system involves four important nondimensional pa-
rameters: the thermal Rayleigh number λ, the solute Rayleigh number η, the
Prandtl number σ and the Lewis number τ , deﬁned by (2.5). We examine in
this article diﬀerent transition/instability regimes deﬁned by these parameters. We
aim to get a better understanding of the diﬀerent physical mechanisms involved in
the onset of convection. It is hoped that this will enable progress to be made in
the theoretical understanding of the onset of double diﬀusive instabilities.

From the physical point of view, it is natural to consider only the case where the
Prandtl number σ > 1. The Lewis number τ measures the ratio of two diﬀusivities.
From the oceanic circulation point of view, the heat diﬀuses about 100 times more
rapidly than salt [11]; hence τ < 1.
In this case, diﬀerent regimes of stabilities
and instabilities/transitions of the basic state can be described by regions in the
λ-η plane (the thermal and salt Rayleigh numbers) as shown in Figure 3.1. In this
article, we focus on the regimes where

η < ηc =

π4τ 2(1 + σ−1)(1

τ )−1.

−

27
4

In the case where η > ηc, transitions to periodic or aperiodic solutions are expected,
and will be addressed elsewhere.

Second, we show that there are two diﬀerent transition regimes: continuous

and jump, dictated by a nondimensional parameter

For the regime with η < ηc1, the transition is continuous when the thermal

Rayleigh number λ crosses a critical value

ηc1 =

π4τ 3(1

τ 2)−1.

−

27
4

λc(η) =

+

η
τ

27
4

π4.

The rigorous result in this case is stated in Theorem 3.3.

For the regime with ηc1 < η < ηc, the transition is jump near λ = λc(η). It is
shown also that for this case, there is a saddle-node bifurcation at λ∗(η) < λc(η),
together with the hysteresis feature of the transition in λ∗(η) < λ < λc(η). The
rigorous result in this case is stated in Theorem 3.4, and schematically illustrated
by Figure 3.3.

Third, as an attractor, the bifurcated attractor has asymptotic stability in the
sense that it attracts all solutions with initial data in the phase space outside
of the stable manifold of the basic state. As Kirchg¨assner indicated in [5], an
ideal stability theorem would include all physically meaningful perturbations and
establish the local stability of a selected class of stationary solutions, and today
we are still far from this goal. On the other hand, ﬂuid ﬂows are normally time
dependent. Therefore bifurcation analysis for steady state problems provides in
general only partial answers to the problem, and is not enough for solving the
stability problem. Hence it appears that the right notion of asymptotic stability

(1.1)

(1.2)

(1.3)

4

C. HSIA, T. MA, AND S. WANG

should be best described by the attractor near, but excluding, the trivial state. It
is one of our main motivations for introducing the attractor bifurcation.

Fourth, another important aspect of the study is to classify the structure/pattern
of the solutions after the bifurcation. A natural tool to attack this problem is the
structural stability of the solutions in the physical space. Thanks to the aforemen-
tioned geometric theory of 2D incompressible ﬂows, the structure and its transitions
of the convection states in the physical space is analyzed, leading in particular to a
rigorous justiﬁcation of the roll structures. More patterns and structures associated
with the double diﬀusive models will be studied elsewhere.

Fifth, for mathematical completeness and for applications to other physical
problems, the bifurcation analysis is also carried out for the case where the Lewis
number τ > 1. In this case, only the continuous transition is present. The rigorous
result in this case is stated in Theorem 3.5.

This article is organized as follows. The basic governing equations are given in
Section 2, and the main theorems are stated in Section 3. The remaining sections
are devoted to the proof of the main theorems, with Section 4 on a recapitulation of
the attractor bifurcation theory and the geometric theory of incompressible ﬂows,
Section 5 on eigenvalue problems, Section 6 on center manifold reductions, and
Section 7 on the completion of the proofs.

Theorem 4.2. Let the conditions (4.4) and (4.5) hold true. Then the solution to

(2) If τ > 1, β111 = 0 is a simple zero of f11(β) for λ = λc.

Proof. Since λ

7. Completion of the proofs

We demonstrate the proof of Theorem 3.3; Theorem 3.5 can be proved in the

same fashion.

7.1. S1-Attractor. First, Assertion (1) of Theorem 3.3 follows from (6.12)-(6.14)
and Lemma 6.1. Then, by Theorem 4.2, the equations bifurcate from (0, λc) to an
attractor Σλ for λ > λc, which is homeomorphic to S1.

7.2. Singularity Cycle. We shall prove that the bifurcated attractor Σλ of (2.4)-
(2.8) given in Theorem 3.3 is a cycle of steady state solutions. First, let

H ′ =
{
H ′
1 = H1 ∩

u(
(U, T, S)
|
H ′.

−

x, z) =

u(x, z)
}

,

−

It is well-known that H ′ and H ′
by (2.10) in the sense that

1 are invariant spaces for the operator Lλη + G given

Lλη + G : H ′
1 is simple when η < ηc. By the
It is clear that the ﬁrst eigenvalue of Lλη|
Kransnoselski bifurcation theorem ( see aomng others Chow and Hale [2] and Niren-
berg [10]), when λ crosses λc, the equations bifurcate from the trivial solution to
a steady state solution in H ′. Therefore the attractor Σλ contains at least one

1 →
H ′

H ′.

steady state solution. Secondly, it’s easy to check that the equations (2.4)-(2.8) are
translation invariant in x-direction. Hence if ψ0(x, z) = (U (x, z), T (x, z), S(x, z))
is a steady state solution, then ψ0(x + ρ, z) are steady state solutions as well. By
periodic conditions in x-direction, the set

Sψ0 =

ρ
ψ0(x + ρ, z)
|

{

∈

R

}

is a cycle homeophic to S1 in H1. Therefore the steady state of (2.4)-(2.8) generates
a cycle of steady state solutions. Hence the bifurcated attractor Σλ contains at least
a cycle of steady state solutions.

7.3. Asymptotic structure of solutions. It’s easy to see that for any initial
value ψ0 = (U0, T0, S0)
0 such that the solution ψ =
H, there is a time t1 ≥
(U (t, ψ0), T (t, ψ0), S(t, ψ0)) is C∞ for t > t1, and is uniformly bounded in Cr-norm
1. Hence, by Theorem 4.1, we have

We infer then from (6.12) and (6.14) that for any steady state solution φ =

Σλ of (2.4)-(2.8), the vector ﬁeld e = (e1, e2) can be expressed as

r√2 sin(αx + θ) cos πz + v1(x111, y111, β111),

Therefore the vector ﬁeld (7.4) is regular, and consequently, the vector ﬁeld e in
(7.2) is regular for any λc < λ < λc +ǫ for some ǫ small. It follows from Theorem 4.7
that the vector ﬁeld e of (7.2) is topologically equivalent to the vector ﬁeld e0 given
by (7.4), which has the topological structure as shown in Figure 3.5.



7.4. Proof of Theorem 3.5. Inferring from (6.12)-(6.14) and Lemma 6.1, the
equations bifurcate from (0, λc) to a repeller Σ1
λ for λ < λc, which is homeomorphic
to S1. Since (U, T, S) = (0, 0, 0) is a global attractor for λ near 0 , there exists a
saddle-node bifurcation point λ0 in between 0 and λc. This completes the proof.

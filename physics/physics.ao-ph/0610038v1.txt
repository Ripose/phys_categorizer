ABSTRACT

A new method of accurately calculating the capacitance of realistic ice particles is described: such values
are key to accurate estimates of sublimation rates in numerical weather models. We have directly simulated
the trajectories of diﬀusing water molecules, using random ‘walkers’. By counting how many of these tra-
jectories intersect the surface of the ice particle (which may be any shape) and how many escape outside
a spherical boundary far from the particle, we have estimated the capacitance of a number of model ice
particle habits including hexagonal columns and plates, ‘scalene’ columns and plates, bullets, bullet-rosettes,
dendrites, and realistic aggregate snowﬂakes. For ice particles with sharp edges and corners this method is
an eﬃcient and straightforward way of solving Laplace’s equation for the capacitance. Provided that a large
enough number of random walkers are used to sample the particle geometry (∼ 104) we expect the calcu-
lated capacitances to be accurate to within ∼ 1%. The capacitance for our modelled aggregate snowﬂakes
(C/Dmax = 0.25, normalised by the maximum dimension Dmax) is shown to be in close agreement with
recent aircraft measurements of snowﬂake sublimation rates. This result shows that the capacitance of a
sphere (C/Dmax = 0.5) which is commonly used in numerical models, overestimates the evaporation rate of
snowﬂakes by a factor of two.

We have also investigated the eﬀect of vapor ‘screening’ by crystals growing in the vicinity of one another,
and the results clearly show the diﬃculties in accurately estimating crystal growth rates from laboratory
experiments. The reduction in vapor supply caused by this screening is found to signiﬁcantly reduce the
capacitance compared to a crystal growing in isolation, by a factor of three in our model setup.

1. Introduction

The growth and evaporation of ice particles by
diﬀusion of water vapor on to and away from the
surface of ice particles are fundamental processes for
the development of ice clouds and precipitation. The
density of water vapor ρ around such an ice particle
is governed by Laplace’s equation:

2ρ = 0,

∇

(1)

under quasi-steady-state conditions (Pruppacher and
Klett 1997). Typically the separation between ice
particles in a cloud is such that each ice particle may
be considered in isolation against a background vapor
density ρ∞. If the vapor density at the surface ρs is
assumed to be constant, this leads to the growth rate:

by application of Gauss’s law over the particle surface
s, where D is the diﬀusion coeﬃcient for water vapor,
and the capacitance C characterizes the shape and
size of the ice particle.

The assumption of constant ρs implies a constant
surface temperature. The temperature Ts at any
given part of the surface is determined by both the
ﬂux of vapor on to that part of the crystal, resulting

partment of Meteorology, University of Reading, Berkshire,

in the release of latent heat; and by the rate at which
that heat is conducted away from the crystal. Since
the equations for diﬀusion of vapor and transport of
heat take the same form, even if a portion of the sur-
face has a larger ﬂux of vapor on to it and becomes
hotter through the release of latent heat, it should
lose that extra heat at a correspondingly higher rate,
resulting in a constant temperature across the whole
particle surface.

The assumption of constant ρs motivates an anal-
ogy with electrostatics, where the results for the ca-
pacitance C are well known for simple geometries (see
table 1). However, exact solutions for the non-smooth
shapes of natural ice particles are not available, and
in numerical models (eg. Wilson and Ballard 1999)
a capacitance based on one of the shapes in table 1
is usually applied in its place.
It is far from clear
whether this approximation is a reasonable one, or
what the capacitance of realistic ice particles actu-
ally is, particularly for large particles which may be
complex aggregates. Chiruta and Wang (2003) sug-
gested a reﬁnement to this situation by approximat-
ing bullet rosette crystals by a set of smooth lobes and
solving equation 1 numerically using a ﬁnite-element
method to obtain the vapor density ρ around the par-
ticle, and capacitance C. Recently, the same authors
have also applied this procedure to solid and hollow
columns, estimating the capacitance for ﬁve model
aspect ratios (Chiruta and Wang 2005). McDonald
(1963) used metal models of ice particles to simulate

ice particles and made measurements of their capac-
itance, however the presence of the connecting wire
combined with the small magnitude of the capaci-
tances involved limits the accuracy of such an ap-
proach.

In this paper we describe a new method for cal-
culating the capacitance of realistic ice particles. We
use a Monte Carlo approach, directly sampling the
trajectories of diﬀusing water molecules onto the sur-
face of an ice particle. For the non-smooth shapes of
realistic ice particles, this turns out to be an eﬃcient
method of solving Laplace’s equation and accurately
estimating C. Also, since we are sampling steady-
state diﬀusion, we are able to build up the statis-
tics for C by sampling one water molecule trajectory
at a time, and this means that very little computer
It is interesting to note that
memory is required.
random walker sampling has recently been applied
in the electrostatics community to solve Laplace’s
equation and calculate electrical capacitances for con-
ductors with sharp edges (eg. Hwang and Mascagni
2004) since it bypasses many of the artefacts in-
troduced by boundary-element, ﬁnite-diﬀerence and
ﬁnite-element methods which can cause systematic
errors (Wintle 2004).

In this work we have sampled the capacitance of a
number of model pristine ice crystal types, as well as
aggregate snowﬂakes. These shapes are much more
realistic than those that are used in numerical models
at present, and therefore we should have much more
conﬁdence that the results given here accurately rep-
resent the capacitance of natural ice particles. This
is very important if quantitative comparisons are to
be made between observations and model predictions
of deposition and evaporation (eg. Forbes and Hogan
2006).

2. Method

The simplest Monte Carlo model for solving (1)
runs as follows. A random walker is placed on a

large sphere, radius R∞.
Its position is chosen at
random with uniform probability over the sphere’s
surface. This represents the far-ﬁeld where the sur-
faces of equal vapor density are spherical. Once re-
leased from this sphere, the walker is allowed to dif-
fuse around, taking steps much smaller than any char-
acteristic length scales in the target ice particle. Each
step is taken in a random direction. The walker’s mo-
tion is tracked until either i) it hits the surface of the
particle, or ii) it escapes outside the large sphere R∞
(where the ‘background’ vapor density ρ∞ is ﬁxed).
Note that we have treated the ice particle as a perfect
absorber with ρs = 0, but from (2) we see that our
calculated capacitances will be valid for any value of
ρs (including both deposition and evaporation) pro-
vided that it is constant over the ice particle surface.
The process is repeated for a large number of walk-
ers until an accurate sample of hits and misses has
been obtained: then the capacitance may be calcu-
lated as C = f R∞ where f is the fraction of walkers
that hit the target. We emphasize that the values of
the capacitance C estimated using the above method
are the same irrespective of the particle surface vapor
density/temperature: the capacitance is a function of
the shape and size of the particle alone, provided that
ρs and Ts are constant.

In practice, the method outlined above is very in-
eﬃcient, with a large amount of time being spent
tracking the walkers as they take very small steps
through large regions of empty space. To improve
the method, we use the fact that the probability dis-
tribution for the trajectories of random walkers which
encounter no obstacles is isotropic: this allows us to
make a number of signiﬁcant improvements to the al-
gorithm. The ﬁrst improvement is to start the walk-
ers on a sphere much closer to the particle, with ra-
dius R such that this sphere just encloses the particle,
as illustrated in ﬁgure 1. Because the random walk-
ers released from R∞ encounters no obstacles between
R∞ and R, starting the walkers with a uniform dis-
tribution over the surface of this much closer sphere
introduces no bias at all on the statistics. The only
condition is that if the walkers move outside R we
must track them all the way to the outer boundary
R∞ before assuming that they have gone to inﬁn-
ity. However, this is not a great burden: if a walker
ﬁnds itself outside of R, we can let it take large steps
(as large as the shortest distance back to the sphere
R), since we can be sure it will encounter no obsta-
cles over this step length. We emphasise that this
does not force the vapor density proﬁle at radius R
to be spherical (which we would be incorrect); we
are simply using the fact that the density of walkers
which start from R∞ and diﬀuse around until they
reach R does have a spherical proﬁle (because they

and the thickness of the absorption layer was ǫ = 0.001 (0.1%
of the side length).

Hwang 2003); however, for our purposes, simply us-
ing a small value of ǫ should be suﬃcient. To test
the accuracy of the method, we have used it to calcu-
late the capacitance of a unit cube, which is known
to within a tolerance of 10−7 (Hwang and Mascagni
2004). Provided a large number of walkers are used
(> 104), the calculation using our method shows ex-
cellent agreement to well within 1% of this established
value, as shown in ﬁgure 2. Sensitivity show indicate
that increasing R∞ to a value of 1000R has no eﬀect
on the estimated capacitance to within

0.1%.

We have also tested our algorithm against par-
ticles where the analytic solution is known (see ta-
ble 1). For a thin circular disc with unit radius and
thickness of 0.001, we estimate the capacitance to be
C = 0.639, which matches the exact analytical re-
sult for an inﬁnitely thin disc (C = 2/π = 0.637) to
within 1%. For a unit sphere we ﬁnd that our method
also agrees with the theoretical value (C = 1) to well
within 1%. In both cases 104 walkers were used.

3. Results

Having established that the method is accurate,
we proceed to apply it to a number of model ice par-
ticle habits, and the results of this are described be-
low.

a. Hexagonal columns and plates

Close to cloud top, one of the most common pris-
tine ice crystal habits is the hexagonal prism (Prup-
pacher and Klett 1997). We have used our random
walker method to calculate the capacitance of these
particle shapes, and two examples of this kind of crys-

Fig. 1: Diagram illustrating the random walker method.
Walkers start from the sphere R enclosing the particle, and
are tracked along a random walk until they i) hit the particle,
or ii) escape beyond a distant spherical outer boundary R∞.
Note that outside R the walker is able to take big jumps with-
out any change in its statistics; inside R, the walkers can take
a jump equal to the distance to the closest point on the sur-
face of the ice particle. In both cases the jumps are in random
directions.

have not yet had a chance to hit the ice particle, so
their statistics cannot have been aﬀected by it). This
improvement allows us to reduce the time spent fol-
lowing the movement of the walker whilst it is far
from the particle, without altering the statistics of
how many walkers hit the particle at all.

While the walker is inside the sphere R we must
be more careful. We can still optimize the step length
of our walkers though, by calculating the minimum
distance from the walker to the closest point on the
ice particle after each step, and setting this distance
to be the length of the next step. We assume that
the walker has hit this ice particle if it comes within
some small distance ǫ of one of the surfaces. Again,
we repeat the whole process for a large number of
walkers so that we may accurately sample the parti-
cle’s capacitance, which is now given by C = f R.

The accuracy of the method described above is
determined by three factors: i) the number of walk-
ers used; ii) how far away the ‘inﬁnite’ boundary R∞
is placed; and iii) the thickness of the thin absorb-
ing layer ǫ. In our calculations we have set the outer
boundary condition to be R∞ = 500R, and the ab-
sorption layer thickness ǫ is set to be less than 0.1%
of the smallest side length of any of the faces on
the particle. There are alternative methods that by-
pass the construction of such a layer (Mascagni and

prisms calculated for a constant width (a = 1), where
we have varied the aspect ratio between 0.01 and 50.
We have ﬁtted a curve to our data points and have
found that the equation:

closely approximates our data to within
3%; this
curve is overlaid in ﬁgure 5 for comparison. Also
shown in ﬁgure 5 is the ﬁtted curve derived for hexag-
onal columns and plates by Chiruta and Wang (2005)
using a ﬁnite-element method. They proposed a lin-
ear ﬁt C = (0.751 + 0.491A)a, and this is plotted in
ﬁgure 5 for comparison with our results. Over the
range of aspect ratios they considered (A = 0.2 to
3.33) their results are 20–30% higher than our calcu-
lated values. The source of this discrepancy between
their data points and ours most likely lies in the posi-
tioning of the outer boundary: in Chiruta and Wang’s
ﬁnite-element calculations it was placed at a distance
10 particle radii; our random walker method has
of
allowed us to place it much further away, at a dis-
tance of 500 radii. Sensitivity analysis (M. Chiruta –
personal communication) indicates that if the outer
boundary in their ﬁnite-element method is placed too
close to the particle, the estimated capacitances are
systematically higher than their true values. The po-
sition of the outer boundary is a parameter to which

tance of the crystals, and estimate that our results
for C are accurate to within 1%. The distribution
of random walkers incident on the faces of a column
are shown in side projection in ﬁgure 4: as one would
expect from equation 1, walkers impact on the parti-
cle all across the surface, but are most concentrated

capacitance results are surprisingly sensitive: this is-
sue was also encountered in the experiments of Mc-
Donald (1963) who found that the measured capaci-
tance of metal ice particle models (smaller than 5cm)
placed inside a 1m Faraday cage were sensitive to the
position of the model inside the cage.

−

The ﬁnal curve plotted on ﬁgure 5 shows the
results for spheroids with major and minor axes
matched to the length and maximal basal span of
the crystal, and gives reasonable agreement over the
whole range of aspect ratios considered here (relative
error: +20% for A = 0.01;
3% for A = 1; +9% for
A = 50). This is at odds with Chiruta and Wang’s
conclusion that spheroids always provided a signif-
icant underestimate of the capacitance of hexagonal
columns, but from the above discussion it seems clear
that this is because their method overestimated the
capacitance of those hexagonal columns. We note
that although their absolute values of C are overes-
timates, Chiruta and Wang’s main conclusion that
solid and hollow columns have almost identical ca-
pacitances to one another should still be correct.

We have compared the capacitance of thin hexag-
onal plates to that of a thin circular disc. The mea-
surements of McDonald (1963) indicated that a disc
with the same surface area is a reasonable approxima-
tion for the capacitance of a plate. This is backed up
by our calculations, where we ﬁnd that a plate with
A = 0.01 has a capacitance of C/a = 0.535, com-
pared to the equivalent-area disc which has C/a =
0.91

2/π = 0.579 (8% higher).

b. ‘Scalene’ columns and plates

It has been observed (Bailey and Hallett 2004)
that the basal faces of columns and plates are not
always perfect regular hexagons, but are often some-
what distorted. Here we calculate the capacitance
of two so-called ‘scalene’ forms similar to those re-
ported in that paper, and assess the impact of break-
ing the perfect hexagonal symmetry. The shapes
of the model scalene basal faces considered here are
shown in ﬁgure 6. In both cases the maximum span
across the basal face is deﬁned as 2a, and the aspect
ratio A is deﬁned as before. We calculate the ca-
pacitances of these scalene crystals for three aspect
ratios: A = 0.1, A = 1 and A = 10, and compare the
results with a perfect hexagonal crystal of the same
maximum basal span and length.

The basal face of the ﬁrst scalene crystal is a ‘ﬂat-
tened’ hexagon, with 4 short sides and 2 longer sides,
and a width perpendicular to the maximum basal
span of a (compared to √3a for a regular hexagon).
The internal angles are all 120◦. For A = 0.1 and
A = 1 we ﬁnd that C is reduced by approximately
10% relative to a regular hexagonal column. For

Fig. 6: Geometry of basal faces for the distorted or ‘scalene’
hexagonal columns and plates. For both types the maximum
span across the basal face is deﬁned as 2a and all of the inter-
nal angles are 120◦. The model shapes are: (a) a ‘ﬂattened’
hexagon with 4 short sides and 2 longer sides; (b) a second
scalene type with 3 short sides and 3 longer sides.

A = 10 the capacitance is only 2% lower than the
regular column.

The second model scalene crystal type has 3 short
sides and 3 long sides, with a span between opposite
sides of √3a (the same as for a regular hexagon). For
this type we found that C is essentially identical to
a regular column/plate for all three aspect ratios, to
within 4%. We conclude that distortion of the hexag-
onal geometry of the crystals has a relatively small
impact on their capacitance, and the only signiﬁcant
diﬀerence in the growth/evaporation rates is likely
to be from surface/crystalline eﬀects which are not
included here.

c. Bullets and bullet-rosettes

Bullets and bullet-rosettes are one of the most
common crystal habits in cirrus clouds (Heymsﬁeld
and Iaquinta 2000). Here we consider some simple
model bullets and bullet-rosettes as illustrated in ﬁg-
ure 7. The bullets are modelled by a hexagonal col-
umn of length L, width 2a, with an hexagon-based
pyramid attached to one of one end. We deﬁne P
as the ratio of the height of the pyramid cap rela-
tive to the column length, and in what follows we
will assume a value of 1
2 . We deﬁne the aspect ratio
A = L/2a, as before.

We have calculated the capacitance of single bul-
lets with diﬀerent thicknesses corresponding to as-
pect ratios A between 1 and 10. The measured ca-
pacitances are plotted in ﬁgure 8. Equation 3 for
hexagonal columns of the same width (= 2a) and to-
tal length (= L + P L) is also plotted on the ﬁgure.
Comparison between the two shows that our model
bullets have a capacitance which is reduced by a uni-

form 7.5% compared to that of a column. Reducing
the size of the pyramid cap to P = 1
4 (following Macke
et al 1996) we ﬁnd the capacitance is now only 5.5%
lower than that the complete column, and further re-
ductions in P result in an asymptotic approach to the
capacitance of a simple column.

Three model rosettes were constructed, and these
are illustrated in ﬁgure 7. The ‘2-rosette’ is simply
a linear combination of the two bullets, joined at the
tip. Calculations for a range of aspect ratios in the
range A = 1 to 10 indicate that the capacitance of
the 2-rosette is essentially identical a solid column of
the same overall length and breadth, and given the
geometry, this is not surprising.

The ‘4-rosette’ has 4 bullets lying in a plane, each
neighbouring bullet seperated by 90◦. Due to the
more complex geometry of this crystal shape, we have
calculated its capacitance relative to the maximum
dimension Dmax (rather than the bullet width) for
a variety of aspect ratios: these values are shown in
ﬁgure 9. We have ﬁtted the curve:

C = 0.35A−0.27Dmax,

(4)

which appears to provide a close approximation to the
data. Also shown in ﬁgure 9 is the capacitance of an
oblate spheroid with major and minor axes matched
to the overall dimensions of the rosette (major axis
= 2L+2LP , minor axis = 2a) and this curve overesti-
mates the capacitance quite severely except when the
aspect ratio of the bullets is close to unity. We also
show the values for a disc (see table 1) with the same
maximum dimension, and this also overestimates the
capacitance for aspect ratios larger than
1.5. A
sphere with the same maximum dimension is found
to overestimate the capacitance by more than a factor
of two for rosettes of thin bullets.

normalised relative to the maximum dimension of the rosette

rosette; crosses are the values for the 6-arm rosette. Solid
black and gray lines are the respective ﬁtted curves (see text).
The dashed line shows value of C for a sphere of the same
maximum dimension; the dotted line shows value for a thin
disc. The capacitance of an oblate spheroid with a major axis
of P (1 + L) and minor axis of 2a is shown by the dash-dot line.

The ﬁnal model crystal is a ‘6-rosette’ made of
six bullets in a three-dimensional cross shape, each
seperated from its neighbours by an angle of 90◦. The
data for this rosette is also shown in ﬁgure 9 and the
capacitances are approximately 15% higher than for
the 4-bullet rosette. We have ﬁtted a curve to this
data, and ﬁnd that

C = 0.40A−0.25Dmax

(5)

is a good approximation to it. Again, a sphere of
the same maximum dimension strongly overestimates
the capacitance at all aspect ratios; a disc provides
a closer approximation, but still overestimates the
capacitance at large aspect ratios.

d. Dendrites

We have constructed two model dendrite crystal
types. The ﬁrst is a simple six-armed star shape,
where each arm is a ‘ﬂattened’ hexagonal plate simi-
lar to those described in section (3b). Each of these
arms is separated from its neighbours by an angle
of 60◦. The arms overlap at the centre of the crys-
tal, and the internal angles of the arms are all 120◦.
The span between the tips of two opposite arms is
deﬁned as 2a, and the thickness is ﬁxed as (2a)/100.
The width of the arms is characterised by the ratio
A′ = w/a which we deﬁne as the ratio of the separa-
tion between the two longest sides of the hexagon w
to the arm length a. These dimensions are marked on
ﬁgure 10, which shows the distribution of impacting
walkers for a star crystal with A′ = 0.2.

The capacitance of our stars as a function of the
width of the arms is shown in ﬁgure 11. For a star

lower than a hexagonal plate of the same overall di-
mensions (C = 0.535a). As the arms become thicker,
the capacitance rises and asymptotically approaches
the value for a solid plate. The curve:

The second model is an adaptation of the star
model above, where we have added a pair of sec-
ondary branches to each arm, each with one third
the dimensions of the main arms. These secondary
branches are positioned with one end at the centre
of the main arm, and oriented at an angle of 60◦ on
either side of it. Figure 10 also shows the distribu-
tion of impacting walkers on this crystal type, with
A′ = 0.05.

crystal for diﬀerent arm thicknesses, and the data

e. Aggregates

We applied our method to

In this section we consider aggregates of the above
ice crystal types. Aggregates are often the domi-
nant particle habit in deep non-precipitating cirrus
clouds (Field and Heymsﬁeld 2003, Westbrook et al
2006), as well as in snowstorms (Jiusto and Weick-
mann 1973). A recent theoretical model of ice crys-
tal aggregation (Westbrook et al 2004) has allowed
us to produce large samples of realistic ‘synthetic’ ice
aggregates.
In this section we have calculated the
capacitance of these synthetic snowﬂakes in the ex-
pectation that the results ought to be a good approx-
imation to the capacitance of natural ice aggregates.
1000 synthetic aggre-
gates sampled from the simulations of Westbrook et
al (2004): a few examples are shown in ﬁgure 12. We
have calculated the average capacitance of the syn-
thetic aggregates, using 103 walkers to sample each
individual aggregate. We note that this is a smaller
number of walkers than was used for the pristine ice
crystal habits; however, we are averaging the results
over several diﬀerent realisations of the aggregate ge-
ometry (every aggregate snowﬂake is diﬀerent), so we
expect that our eventual statistics should be accurate.
In any case the results for the unit cube in section 2
indicate that the error in the calculated values for
each individual aggregate should be less than 10%.

∼

For each aggregate, the ratio of capacitance to
maximum dimension C/Dmax was calculated, and the
results binned and averaged as a function of the num-
ber of crystals in the aggregate: this is shown in ﬁgure
13. The ‘monomer’ crystals in this case were hexag-
onal columns with an aspect ratio of A = 2. The
capacitance of the monomer columns is C/Dmax =
0.319 (see section 3a), but for an aggregate of just
two columns this is reduced to 0.21
0.02, since two
columns stuck together is a much more open geome-
try than a single column. As more columns are aggre-
gated the normalised capacitance rises to an asymp-
totic limit of 0.25
0.02. This value is in strong
agreement with recent in-situ aircraft measurements
of aggregate snowﬂake sublimation made by Field et
al (2006) during a Lagrangian descent through a sub-
saturated portion of an ice cloud, where a value of

hexagonal columns, sampled from the simulations of West-
brook et al (2004). The aspect ratio of the columns is A = 4.

C/Dmax = 0.23 was found.

We have repeated the calculations for diﬀerent
monomer aspect ratios, and this is shown in ﬁgure
14. We ﬁnd that irrespective of the monomer shape
the normalised capacitance approaches an asymptotic
value of between 0.25 (thin columns A = 8) and 0.28
(squat columns A = 1). Changing the monomer
crystal type to bullet-rosettes rather than columns
is found to have very little eﬀect on the capacitance,
again yielding asymptotic values in the same range.
This capacitance is smaller than a disc or sphere of
the same maximum dimension, and the implication
is that numerical models which assume these simple
shapes are overestimating the growth/evaporation
rate, by a factor of two in the case of the sphere.

It may perhaps appear counter-intuitive that the
capacitance of aggregates should approach a con-
stant value relative to their maximum dimension
(C/Dmax = constant). The structure of the aggre-
gates approaches a fractal geometry (Westbrook et
al 2004) and as a result becomes increasingly open
as the aggregates grow to contain more and more
ice crystals. Because of this, the eﬀective density
decreases with size as (Dmax)−1 (in agreement with
experimental data: Brown and Francis 1995, Heyms-
ﬁeld et al 2002). One might therefore anticipate that
C/Dmax would be reduced for large aggregates, since
there is more empty space within a radius Dmax/2 of
the particle centre, and therefore (one would imag-
ine) more opportunity for a water molecule coming
within that radius to escape. However, the results
of Ball and Witten (1984) show that water molecules

tals were hexagonal columns with A = 2. The calculated val-
ues of C/Dmax were binned and averaged as a function of the
number of crystals per aggregate, as shown on the horizon-
tal axis. Error bars are one standard deviation, points with
no error bar indicate the value for a single aggregate. The
normalised capacitance asymptotically approaches a value of
C/Dmax ≃ 0.25. Overlaid are theoretical values for a sphere

following a Brownian path are exceptionally eﬃcient
at exploring three dimensional space, and because of
this the ice particle appears essentially opaque to the
incident water molecules (i.e. a ﬁxed fraction of those
venturing within Dmax/2 will be absorbed). As a re-
sult, C/Dmax = constant is in fact the physically sen-
sible result for aggregates (see appendix for further
details).

4. Screening

Growth rates derived from laboratory experi-
ments such as those of Bailey and Hallett (2004)
are usually measured from crystals which grow not
in isolation, but surrounded by other growing crys-
tals. Screening of one ice crystal by another may be
an important eﬀect in light of the above discussion
on aggregates, since the diﬀusing water molecules are
very eﬃcient at exploring the space around the parti-
cle, so neighbouring crystals may constrict the vapor
supply to one another. An understanding of such
screening eﬀects is important if laboratory data are
to be accurately interpreted.

For our model setup we consider 8 identical hexag-
onal columns with A = 5 in a ‘spiral staircase’ geom-
etry, growing with their longest axis in the horizontal
direction. Neighboring crystals are oﬀset in the ver-
tical direction by a column’s width and are rotated
around the vertical axis by 45◦. This is shown in
ﬁgure 15 and is roughly modelled after photographs
of experimental setup in Bailey and Hallett (2004).
We used 104 walkers to sample the capacitance of
these crystals, and found that the vapor supply to
the innermost crystals is inhibited to such an extent
that their capacitance is reduced to approximately
one third of its value for a single column in isola-
0.75 compared to 2.28 in isolation).
tion (C/a
This result demonstrates how sensitive the vapor ﬁeld
around a crystal is to other sources/sinks of vapor in
the vicinity.
It also shows that if the growth rates
from experiments are to be compared to theoretical
capacitances, the crysals must be grown in isolation,
or separated from one another as much as possible.
Electrodynamic trapping techniques (eg. Swanson et
al 1999) where ice particles are levitated in an electric
ﬁeld and allowed to grow in isolation may be useful in
this respect, although to the authors’ knowledge the
results have so far been limited to small particles, less
than 100µm in size.

5. Discussion

Fig. 14:
The capacitance of aggregates with diﬀerent
monomer ratios A between 1 and 8. All of the curves approach
an asymptotic value in the range 0.25–0.28.

The capacitance for pristine ice crystals and ag-
gregate snowﬂakes has been calculated using a new
Monte Carlo method, and these new values should be
an improvement on the traditional approximations of

smooth spheroids or discs. Application of these ca-
pacitances to estimate the actual growth/evaporation
rates requires a prescription for the diﬀerence be-
tween the surface and the far-ﬁeld vapor densities
(ρs
ρ∞). Using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation,
an expression for dm/dt in terms of the supersatura-
tion with respect to ice (S

where the parameters A(T ) and B(T, P ) are given in
Pruppacher and Klett (1997) and depend on the am-
bient temperature T and pressure P . We believe that
the results described in this paper may help to im-
prove the estimation of growth and evaporation rates
calculated in numerical weather prediction and cloud
resolving models, especially for spatially extended
particles such as bullet rosettes, dendrites and aggre-
gates, where modelling the particle as a simple sphere
(eg. the Met Oﬃce forecast model: Wilson and Bal-
lard 1999) can overestimate
by a factor of
2. This work may also be valuable to new precipi-
tation models which predict ice particle habit from
the model temperature and humidity (eg. Woods et
al 2006), allowing an appropriate capacitance to be
used for each predicted habit.

The key limitation of the present study is the
question of whether the growth and evaporation rates
of ice crystals are simply dominated by the rate at
which vapor impinges on/diﬀuses away from the ice
crystal surface, or whether surface kinetics plays a
signiﬁcant role in limiting the growth/evaporation
rates. For evaporation of ice particles, Nelson (1997)
showed that the sublimation rate is controlled by (8)
and that surface kinetics can be neglected. This con-
clusion is backed up by in-situ imaging of sublimating
ice particles (Korolev and Isaac 2004) which indicate
that the vapor ﬂux away from the particles is concen-
trated at the corners and edges, as one would expect
if equation (1) controls the vapor density. We there-
fore expect our results to be directly applicable to
calculating the evaporation rates of natural ice par-
ticles.

For deposition, the growth of smooth surfaces un-
der equation 1 alone is well known to be unstable
(Langer 1980, Mullins and Sekerka 1963) and if the
water molecules are simply ‘stuck’ rigidly at the point
where they ﬁrst impinge on the ice surface, fern-
like fractal patterns result (Witten and Sander 1981,
Bowler and Ball 2005). In reality the incident water
molecules will undergo some rearrangement on the
surface of the particle before being incorporated into
the ice lattice; it also seems likely that some frac-
tion of the water molecules incident on the surface
will be rejected completely, depending on the crys-
tal size and ambient conditions. For very small cold

column crystals. Each is rotated by an angle of 45◦ about the
vertical axis relative to its neighbours, and oﬀset in the vertical
direction by a crystal’s width, in an attempt to model crystals
growing on a vertical ﬁlament (indicated by the dotted line).
The growth rate of the innermost crystals is approximately one
third the growth rate of a column growing in isolation.

crystals Magee et al (2006) reports that surface ki-
netic eﬀects play a key role in controlling the growth,
whilst for warmer dendrite crystal types the fern-
like structure implies growth which is largely gov-
erned by the bulk diﬀusion of vapor, albeit with some
anisotropy (Goold et al 2005). For frozen drops, Ko-
rolev et al (2004) report that (8) is in good agreement
with measured growth rates, and that the ice surface
quickly develops roughnesses and protrusions, which
one would expect given equation 1.

20 to

Recently, Bailey and Hallett (2004) compared the
growth rates of laboratory-grown plate and column
70◦C)
crystals (over a temperature range of
to the growth rate calculated using (8), modelling
their lab crystals as spheroids. Their results indicated
that the predicted growth rates were only consistent
with the measured values for aspect ratios close to
A
1: for more extreme aspect ratios the theoretical
values were as much as a factor of four too large for
thin columns, and a factor of eight too large for thin
plates. By contrast, they found that the growth rates
were roughly proportional to the supersaturation, in
agreement with (8). This sensitivity to the bulk ex-
cess vapor implies that the growth is not dominated
by the surface kinetics; more likely is that a fraction
of the impinging vapor cannot be incorporated into
the lattice and is rejected from the surface.

Bailey and Hallett argue that because of the above
discrepancy between predicted and measured growth
rates, the whole approach of (8) is unsuitable for
calculating deposition rates: their recommendation
is that laboratory-measured growth rates should be
used instead. However, the sensitivity of (1) to
screening as discussed in section 4 show that their
measured growth rates may be strongly aﬀected by
neighbouring crystals, restricting the vapor supply,
and reducing the measured capacitance signiﬁcantly
(a factor of 3 in our model setup). The supporting
glass ﬁlament may also play a signiﬁcant role, partic-
ularly for thin columns where the ﬁlament thickness
(50–70µm) is the same size or larger than the basal
faces of the crystals. The interpretation of labora-
tory measured growth rates therefore requires a great
deal of care, and this is an issue where further exper-
iments and theoretical work are urgently required.
Monte Carlo methods similar to the one presented
here should be readily adaptable to incorporate sur-
face kinetic eﬀects when detailed data becomes avail-
able.

The capacitance of realistic ice aggregates has
been calculated for the ﬁrst time (to the authors’
knowledge), and the results are in very close agree-
ment with those estimated by Field et al (2006) from
in-situ aircraft observations of sublimating ice aggre-
gates, again indicating that (8) is a good approxima-

tion for sublimating ice particles. The authors be-
lieve that the capacitances presented here are, in any
case, the best estimates currently available for the
growth and evaporation of realistic ice crystals and
snowﬂakes within the framework of the electrostatic
analogy.

Appendix

Here we show that C/Dmax is a function only of
the shape of an ice aggregate, and not its size. Imag-
ine that the particle is removed and we replace it
with a ‘ghost’ particle which is completely transpar-
ent to the diﬀusing water molecules. The average
water molecule follows a Brownian trajectory, trac-
ing a fractal path with dimension dw = 2 (Falconer
2003). This means that whilst the water molecule is
within a distance Dmax/2 of the ghost particle centre,

this, the aggregates appear essentially opaque to the
diﬀusing water molecules, in the sense that for a given
monomer type, a ﬁxed fraction of the molecules which
venture within a radius Dmax/2 will come into con-
tact with the ice particle. The ratio C/Dmax simply
represents this fraction, and is therefore independent
of size.

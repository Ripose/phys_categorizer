Abstract

We analyze, within the wavelet theory framework, the wandering over a screen
of the centroid of a laser beam after it has propagated through a time-changing
laboratory-generated turbulence. Following a previous work (Fractals 12 (2004) 223)
two quantiﬁers are used, the Hurst parameter, H, and the Normalized Total Wavelet
Entropy, NTWS. The temporal evolution of both quantiﬁers, obtained from the laser
spot data stream is studied and compared. This allows us to extract information of
the stochastic process associated to the turbulence dynamics.

1 INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this work is to statistically describe laser beam propagation
through time-changing laboratory-generated turbulence. To do so, we ana-
lyze data stream corresponding to the centroid position of the laser spot by
using two diﬀerent quantiﬁers obtained from the wavelet theory: the Hurst
parameter, H, and the Normalized Total Wavelet Entropy, NTWS. The for-
mer quantiﬁer results from modeling the centroid’s coordinates as a fractional
Brownian motion (fBm) at stationary turbulence strength [1], while the latter
has been used for a wider set of stochastic processes—see Ref. [2].

The fBm was discovered by Kolmogorov [3] and deﬁned by Mandelbrot and
Van Ness [4] as the only one family of processes which are gaussian, self-similar,
and with stationary increments. The normalized family of these gaussian pro-
cesses, BH, is the one with BH (0) = 0 almost surely, E[BH (t)] = 0, and
covariance

2H + |s|

2H − |t − s|

for s, t ∈ R. The power exponent H is also known as scaling exponent and its
range is bounded between 0 and 1. The estimation of this parameter plays a
key role modeling a fBm time series. One remarkable property of this family
BH is that the H parameter regulates the presence or absence of memory.
In fact, it can be separated in three subfamilies accordingly: long-memory for
1/2 < H < 1, memoryless at H = 1/2 (ordinary Brownian motion), and
short-memory in the case 0 < H < 1/2. Likewise, the Hurst parameter can
be thought as the probability of the next increment of the signal have the
same sign as the previous increment. Thus, it tunes the trayectory regularity.
Fractional Brownian motions are continuous but non-diﬀerentiable processes
(in the usual sense), and only give generalized spectra 1/f α with exponents
α between 1 and 3. As a nonstationary process, the fBm does not have a
spectrum deﬁned in the usual sense; however, it is possible to deﬁne a power
spectrum of the form [5]:

SBH (f ) =

1
|f |2H+1 .

(2)

Remember that this equation is not a valid power spectrum in the theory of
stationary processes since it is a nonintegrable function.

Several properties evidence that wavelet analysis is well-suited to fBm:

(1) fBm is nonstationary but the wavelet coeﬃcients form a stationary pro-

cess at each scale [6, 7];

(2) fBm exhibits positive long-range correlation in the range 1/2 < H < 1

2

but wavelet coeﬃcients have a correlation which is highly small as soon
as N > H + 1/2, where N is the number of vanishing moments associated
to the mother wavelet ψ(t) [7, 8];

(3) the self-similarity of fBm is reproduced in its wavelet coeﬃcients, whose

variance varies as a power law as a function of scale j [6, 7]

log2 n

hC 2

j (k) |BH io ∝ −(2H + 1)j.

(3)

These features are due to the fact that the wavelet family ψa,b is generated
by dilations and translations of a unique admissible mother wavelet ψ(t). So,
the family itself exhibits scale invariance. It should be noted that the ﬁrst two
properties are valid for any process with stationary increments [9].

In particular these properties are widely used for estimating H or the related
spectral exponent α = 2H + 1 [5, 10, 11]. Through the Logscale Diagram the
threefold objective: detection, identiﬁcation and measurements of the scaling
exponent can be achieved [12]. Basically the estimation problem turns into a
linear regression slope estimation.

In order to model the time-changing turbulence situation we consider a gener-
alization where the parameter H is no longer constant, but a continuous func-
tion of the time t (H → H(t)). This generalization was introduced in ﬁnancial
research to model the behaviour of stock market index time series [13–15].
Also, it was recently used to characterize dynamic speckle or biospeckle [16].
A single scaling exponent would be unable to show the complex dynamics
inherent to the data. The constraint of stationary increments is relaxed in this
case. Multifractional Brownian motion (mBm) [17] was formalized as a class
of processes which satisﬁes these properties.

We calculate the time-dependent Hurst exponent by using the wavelet prop-
erties. Provided that variations of H are smooth enough, the signal is divided
into i non-overlapping temporal windows and the scaling exponent is cal-
culated for each subset according to the procedure described at Ref. [1]. A
sequence of Hurst parameter values is obtained. They give the local scaling
exponent around a given instant of time. Artiﬁcially mBm were analyzed in
order to test the quality of our estimator. In Figure 1 one can compare the
theoretical and experimental results for a mBm with H changing linearly from
0.1 to 0.9 with t. The Matlab code introduced by J. F. Coeurjolly [18] was
implemented to simulate the mBm. The signal was divided in 64 temporal
windows of 512 data points. We used the orthogonal cubic spline functions as
mother wavelet and the resolution levels from j = −9 to j = −1.

At the same time, the NTWS is also applied to study this time-changing
turbulence. Introduced as a measure of the degree of order-disorder of the
signal [2], it provides information about the underlying dynamical process

associated with the signal. We deﬁne the NTWS as

SWT = −

pj · ln pj/Smax,

−1

X
j=−N

where

Smax = ln N
(5)
with N, at least, the base 2 logarithm of the number of data points and {pj}
represent the Relative Wavelet Energy (RWE). These are deﬁned as

pj = Ej/Etot,

with Ej = E[C 2
j (k)] the energy at each resolution levels j = −N, · · · , −2, −1
Pj<0 Ej. They yield, at diﬀerent scales, the probability distribution
and Etot =
for the energy. It should be remarked that an orthogonal mother wavelet must
be used within this theory—further details can be found at Ref. [1]. Indeed,
a very ordered process can be represented by a signal with a narrow band
spectrum. A wavelet representation of such a signal will be resolved in few
wavelet resolution levels, i. e., all RWE will be (almost) zero except at the
wavelet resolution levels which includes the representative signal frequency.
For this special levels the RWE will be almost equal to one. As a consequence,
the NTWS will acquire a very small, vanishing value. A signal generated by a
totally random process or chaotic one can be taken as representative of a very
disordered behavior. This kind of signal will have a wavelet representation
with signiﬁcant contributions coming from all frequency bands. Moreover, one
could expect that all contributions will be of the same order. Consequently,
the RWE will be almost equal at all resolutions levels, and the NTWS will
acquire its maximum possible value. Higher values for wavelet entropy means
higher dynamical complexity, higher irregular behaviour and, of course, lower
predictability.

The time evolution of NTWS can be easily implemented. So, it is widely used
to study a wide set of nonstationary natural signal. In particular, it was in-
troduced to quantify the degree of disorder in the electroencephalographic
epileptic records giving information about the underlying dynamical process
in the brain [19], more speciﬁcally of the synchrony of the group cells involved
in the diﬀerent neural responses. Also, monthly time series of diﬀerent solar
activity indices (sunspot numbers, sunspot areas and ﬂare index) were ana-
lyzed [20, 21]. The disorder content of solar cycle activity can be derived by
analyzing the wavelet entropy time evolution. Likewise, the dynamic speckle
phenomenon mentioned above has also been analyzed by using these wavelet
based entropy concepts [22]. In a recent paper it is investigated the relation
existing between these two quantiﬁers—H and NTWS—when they are used
for analyzing fBm [23]. Figure 1 (top and bottom) shows the mBm and his
corresponding NTWS, where the same temporal windows, mother wavelet and
resolution levels were used.

2 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND DATA ADQUISITION

The experimental measures were performed in a laboratory by producing ther-
mal convective turbulence with two electrical heaters in a row. Three diﬀerent
turbulence intensities were generated changing the amount of heat dissipated
for each electrical heater: normal, soft and hard turbulence. Along the laser
path three electronic thermometers sense the air temperature—T 1, T 2 and
T 3, see Fig. 2 (bottom). A time series corresponding to the ﬂuctuations of
the centroid position of a laser beam’s spot (wandering) over a screen, af-
ter propagation through this time-changing laboratory-generated turbulence,
were recorded with a position sensitive detector located as screen at the end
of the path. This record consists of 2, 500, 000 spot beam centroid coordinates
measurements with 500, 000 data for each laboratory-generated turbulence
condition. Further details of the experiment can be found at Ref. [1]. The
temperature and signal records can be observed in Figure 2. There, it can be
observed that the turbulence is increased, and subsequently decreased up to
recover the initial situation.

3 RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS

In the present work, we employ orthogonal cubic spline functions as mother
wavelets. Among several alternatives, cubic spline functions are symmetric and
combine in a suitable proportion smoothness with numerical advantages. They
have become a recommendable tool for representing natural signals [24, 25].
The signal was divided into 606 non-overlapping temporal windows of 4096
data points. Resolution levels between j = −7 and j = −3 were used to
calculate both quantiﬁers. The ﬁrst two levels (j = −1 and j = −2) were
dropped to reduce the noise introduced by the sistem, while the lower levels
were excluded to reduce nonstationary eﬀects as commented in Ref. [1].

Figure 3 shows the quantiﬁers temporal evolution. Both quantiﬁers reveal that
when the turbulence is normal the detector can not be able to resolve position
diﬀerences, and electronic noise associated to the detector is observed. The
NTWS is near one as is expected for a signal generated by a totally random
process and the α value matches with a white noise. When the turbulence is
increased the system changes in an abrupt way—see coordinates’ graphs at
Fig. 2. It is interesting to observe the transition between the diﬀerent intensi-
ties of turbulence for the signal and its corresponding quantiﬁers. The Hurst
parameter discriminates between the other two increased turbulences. It is
possible, in average, to associate a value αx = 1.17, αy = 1.04 for the soft case
and αx = 1.62, αy = 1.51 for the hard turbulence. It should be noted that the
signal has more regularity for the strongest turbulence. The NTWS diminishes

5

notably showing an increment in the order of the system but it is unable to
distinguish between soft and hard turbulence giving values of NTWSx = 0.63,
NTWSy = 0.66 for the soft turbulence and NTWSx = 0.57, NTWSy = 0.63
for the hard turbulence.

It can be followed by comparing Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 that the behavior of the
signal is diﬀerent for both coordinates. Nevertheless, the temporal evolution of
the quantiﬁers is very similar. It is also observed that the system has hysteresis
eﬀect (see Fig. 2 and Fig. 3) as it was expected.

The mBm model is justiﬁed for modeling the dynamics associated to these
processes. We conclude that the associated scaling exponent changes contin-
uously with the turbulence strength. In the future a new generalization will
be considered and studied, the generalized multifractional Brownian motion
(gmBm) [26]. That processes consider that scaling exponent variations may be
very erratic and not necessarily a continuous function of time. The latter con-
dition is a strong limitation in turbulence studies where the scaling exponent
can change widely from time to time.

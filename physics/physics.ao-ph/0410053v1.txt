Probabilistic temperature forecasting: a comparison of four
spread-regression models

Stephen Jewson∗

February 2, 2008

Abstract

Spread regression is an extension of linear regression that allows for the inclusion of a predictor
that contains information about the variance. It can be used to take the information from a weather
forecast ensemble and produce a probabilistic prediction of future temperatures. There are a number
of ways that spread regression can be formulated in detail. We perform an empirical comparison
of four of the most obvious methods applied to the calibration of a year of ECMWF temperature
forecasts for London Heathrow.

1 Introduction

There is considerable demand within industry for probabilistic forecasts of temperature, particularly from
industries that routinely use probabilistic analysis such as insurance, ﬁnance and energy. However there
is considerable disagreement among meteorologists about how such forecasts should be produced and at
present no adequately calibrated probabilistic forecasts are available commercially. Those who need to
use probabilistic forecasts have to make them themselves.
How, then, should probabilistic forecasts of temperature be made? A number of very diﬀerent methods
have been suggested in the literature such as those described in Mylne et al. (2002), Roulston and Smith
(2003) and Raftery et al. (2003). However it seems that all three of these methods, although complex,
suﬀer from the shortcoming that they don’t calibrate the amplitude of variations in the ensemble spread
but rather leave the amplitude to be determined as a by-product of the calibration of the mean.
We take a very diﬀerent, and simpler, approach to the development of probabilistic forecasts than the
authors cited above. Our approach is based on the following philosophy:

• The baseline for comparison for all probabilistic temperature forecasts should be a distribution

derived very simply by using linear regression around a single forecast or an ensemble mean.

• More complex methods can then be tested against this baseline. Before anything more complex
than linear regression is adopted on an operational basis it should be shown to clearly beat linear
regression in out of sample tests. Unfortunately none of the studies cited above compared the
methods they proposed with linear regression, and, given that they seem not to calibrate the
ensemble spread correctly, it would seem possible that they might not perform as well.

We have followed this philosophy and, based on our analysis of one particular dataset of past forecasts
and past observations we have shown that:

• Moving from constant-parameter linear regression to seasonal parameter linear regression gives a
huge improvement in forecast skill for forecasts of both the mean temperature and the distribution
of temperatures (Jewson, 2004a)

• Adding spread as a predictor gives only a very small improvement (Jewson et al. (2003), Jewson

(2003b)).

• Generalising to allow for non-normality gives no improvement at all (Jewson, 2003a).

All these results are summarised and discussed in Jewson (2004c).
In this article we focus on the second of these conclusions: that using the spread as an extra predictor
brings only a very small improvement to forecast skill. This is somewhat disappointing given that it
had been hoped by some that use of the ensemble spread would turn out to be an important factor in
the creation of probabilistic forecasts. We are trying to get a better understanding of why the ensemble
spread brings so little beneﬁt in the tests we have performed. In Jewson (2004b) we concluded that this
is because of:

1. The scoring system we use.

We calibrate and score probabilistic forecasts using the likelihood of classical statistics (Fisher
(1912), Jewson (2003c)). Likelihood, as we have used it, is a measure that considers the ability
of the forecast to predict the whole distribution of future temperatures. Much of the mass in the
distribution of temperature is near the mean and so the likelihood naturally tends to emphasize the
importance of the mean rather than the spread. If we were to use a score that puts more weight
onto the tails of the distribution then the spread might prove more important (although such a
score would not then reﬂect our main interest, which is in the prediction of the whole distribution).

2. The low values of the coeﬃcient of variation of spread (COVS).

Once we have calibrated our ensemble forecast data we ﬁnd that the uncertainty does not vary very
much relative to the mean level of the uncertainty (i.e. the COVS is low). Thus if we approximate
the uncertainty with a constant this does not degrade the forecast to any great extent, and we
have not been able to detect a signiﬁcant impact of the spread in out of sample testing. That the
variations in the calibrated uncertainty are small could be either because the actual uncertainty
does not vary very much or because the ensemble spread is not a good predictor for the actual
uncertainty. In fact it is likely to be a combination of these two eﬀects.

3. The low values of the spread mean variability ratio (SMVR).

We have also found that the amplitude of the variations in the uncertainty in the calibrated forecast
is small relative to the amplitude of the variations in the mean temperature (i.e. the SMVR is low).
As a result accurate prediction of the (small) variations in the uncertainty is not very important
relative to accurate prediction of the (large) variations in the mean temperature.

However in addition to these reasons it is also possible that we have been using the ensemble spread
wrongly in our predictions. The model we have been using represents the unknown uncertainty σ as a
linear function of the ensemble spread (Jewson et al., 2003):

σ = ˆσ + noise

= δ + γs + noise

(1)

(2)

But this model is entirely ad-hoc. Why a linear function? We chose linear because it is the simplest way
to calibrate both the mean uncertainty and the amplitude of the variability of the uncertainty, and not
on the basis of any theory or analysis of the empirical spread-skill relationship. This suggests it is very
important to test other models to see if they perform any better.
In this paper we will compare the original spread-regression model with 3 other spread-regression models.
The four models we compare all have four parameters and so can be compared in-sample. This is
important because the signals we are looking for are weak and obtaining long stationary series of past
forecasts is more or less impossible at this point in time. At some point the numerical modellers will
hopefully start providing long (i.e. multiyear) back-test time series from their models. This will allow
more thorough out of sample testing of calibration schemes such as the spread-regression model and will
facilitate the comparison of models with diﬀerent numbers of parameters: meanwhile we do what we can
with the limited data available.

2 Four spread regression models

The four spread-regression models that we will test are all based on linear regression between anomalies
of the temperature and anomalies of the ensemble mean:

Ti ∼ N (α + βmi, ˆσ)

(3)

The diﬀerence between the models is in the representation of ˆσ.

The original standard-deviation-based spread regression model is:

The variance-based model is:

The inverse-standard-deviation-based model is:

and the inverse-variance-based-model is:

Following Jewson (2004a) the parameters α, β, γ, δ all vary seasonally using a single sinusoid. We ﬁt each
model by ﬁnding the parameters that maximise the likelihood (using numerical methods).
We note that for very small variations in s all these models can be linearised and end up the same as the
linear-in-standard-deviation model given in equation 4.

3 Results

The ﬁrst and most important test is to see which of the models achieves the greatest log-likelihood at the
maximum. The results from this test are shown in ﬁgure 1 (actually in terms of negative log-likelihood
so that smaller is better). In each case the spread-regression results (dashed lines) are shown relative to
results for a constant-variance model (solid line). What we see is that the four models achieve roughly
the same decrease in the negative log-likelihood and that in none of the cases is the decrease very large
compared with the change in the log-likelihood from one lead time to the next. These changes are also
small compared with the change in the log-likelihood that was achieved by making the bias correction
vary seasonally (Jewson, 2004a).
Figure 2 shows the same data as is shown in ﬁgure 1 but as diﬀerences between the spread-regression
models and the constant-variance model. Again we see that there is little to choose between the models.
Figure 3 shows a ﬁfty-day sample of the calibrated mean temperature from the constant-variance model
with the spread-regression calibrated temperatures overlaid. The diﬀerences are very small indeed and
can only really be seen when they are plotted explicitly in ﬁgure 4.
Figure 5 shows the calibrated spread from the constant-variance model and the calibrated spread from
the four spread-regression models. The uncertainty prediction from the constant variance model varies
slowly from one season to the next and has a kink because of the presence of missing values in the forecast
data. We now see rather signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the four spread regression models. The size of
these diﬀerences suggests that the variations in s are not so small that the four spread regression models
are equivalent to the linear-in-standard-deviation model.

4 Conclusions

How to produce good probabilistic temperature forecasts from ensemble forecasts remains a contentious
issue. This is mainly because of disagreement about how to use the information in the ensemble spread.
We have compared 4 simple parametric models that convert the spread into an estimate for the forecast
uncertainty. All the models allow for an oﬀset and a term that scales the amplitude of the variability
of the uncertainty. Although the four models lead to visible diﬀerences in the calibrated spread we have
found only tiny diﬀerences between the impact of these four models on the log-likelihood achieved. Also
none of the models clearly dominates the others.
These results lead us to conclude that:

• the variations in s are not so small that the calibration of the spread can be linearised, which would

make all four models equivalent

• but the changes in the calibrated uncertainty are small enough that they do not have a great impact

on the maximum likelihood achieved in any of the models

• implying that there is simply not very much information in the variations in the spread

It is possible that the models are overﬁtted to a certain extent. This is unavoidable given that we only
have one year of data for ﬁtting these multiparameter models. That none of the models dominates is
rather curious: perhaps all the models are equally bad and none of them come close to modelling the
relationship between spread and skill in a reasonable way. This raises the possibility that better results
could perhaps be achieved by using other parametrisations.
It is diﬃcult to see how to make further progress on these questions until longer series of stationary back-
test data is made available by the numerical modellers. Meanwhile it seems that a pragmatic approach to
producing probabilistic forecasts would be to stick with the constant variance model since more complex
models have shown only a small beneﬁt in in-sample testing, and do not show a signiﬁcant beneﬁt in
out-of-sample testing.

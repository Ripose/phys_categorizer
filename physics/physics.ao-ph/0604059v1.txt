Abstract

We present results of a numerical study of the diﬀerential equa-
tion governing the stationary states of the two-dimensional planetary
atmosphere and magnetized plasma (within the Charney Hasegawa
Mima model). The results show an interesting similarity with the
morphology of a tropical cyclone. Quantitative comparisons are also
favorable and several scaling laws can be formulated connecting the
charactersistic physical parameters of the tropical cyclone.

1 Introduction

The Charney equation describing the Rossby waves in atmosphere (Char-
ney 1948) and the HasegawaMima equation describing the drift waves in
strongly magnetized plasma (Hasegawa and Mima 1978) have identical form
and both exhibit an intrinsic length scale (see Horton and Hasegawa 1994).
A long series of observations, experiments and theoretical (analytical and
numerical) studies has established that the ﬂuids show a natural trend to
organisation. This is most obvious at relaxation from turbulent states when
the ﬂuid evolves toward a reduced subset of ﬂow patterns, characterized by
regular form of the streamfunction as shown for example by Mathaeus et. al.
1991a, Matthaeus et. al. 1991b, Kinney et al. 1995, Horton and Hasegawa
1994 (and references therein).

It has been shown (Spineanu and Vlad 2005) that the stationary states at-
tained at late times in the evolution of the Charney-Hasegawa-Mima (CHM)
ﬂuids are described by the following equation

∆ψ +

1
2p2 sinh ψ (cosh ψ

−

p) = 0

(1)

(where p is a positive constant). There are conﬁrmations that this is the
equation governing the asymptotic stationary states of the CHM ﬂuids: for
Navier-Stokes ﬂuid the scatterplots of (ψ, ω) = (streamfunction, vorticity)
obtained in experiments by de Rooij et al. 1999, and the scatterplots obtained
in numerical simulations by Seyler 1995 are very similar to the nonlinear term
of Eq.(1).

Due to the similar analytical structure (although for largely diﬀerent mag-
nitude of parameters) of the plasma vortex and the atmospheric vortex, we
expect that this equation leads to solutions that may capture the strong
nonlinear character of the atmospheric vortical ﬂows in those states where
the stationarity can be assumed a good approximation. Certainly the prob-
lem of the structure of the atmospheric vortex cannot be reduced in general
to only ﬂuid nonlinear dynamics, knowing the very important role of the
heat exchange and moisture transport and condensation processes. These
are essential elements of tropical cyclogenesis (see Emanuel 1986 and 1989
and references therein) but it is often accepted that the ﬂuid dynamics is
an adequate framework to study the vortex structure at the late stage of
the evolution (Reasor and Montgomery 2001, Kossin and Schubert 2001).
The ﬂuid dynamic nonlinearity becomes the dominant constraint determin-
ing the structure of the velocity ﬁeld when the thermodynamic processes
have reached the stationary equilibrium.

2

The objective of this work is to provide the ﬁrst elements resulting from
a numerical investigation of equation (1), for a range of parameters relevant
for the physics of the atmosphere. The results are summarised here.

The solutions of the diﬀerential equation have the same morphology as
the two-dimensional ﬂow of a tropical cyclone (Willoughby and Black 1996,
Wang and Wu 2004, Reasor and Montgomery 2001, Kossin and Schubert
2001). The solutions are characterized by a very narrow dip in the azimuthal
velocity (tangential wind) in the center of the vortex. The radius of the “max-
imum tangential wind” or the radius of the eye wall is much smaller than
the radius of the vortex. There is a decay of the magnitude of the azimuthal
velocity toward the periphery, which is much slower compared with the fast
decay toward the center. We ﬁnd a very low magnitude (almost vanishing) of
the vorticity over most of the vortex (approx. from the radius of maximum
wind to the periphery), while the magnitude in a narrow central region is
extremely high. Quantitatively, we obtain for the diameter of the cyclone’s
eye a magnitude which compares well with the observations. The maximum
vorticity is in a realistic range and the radial proﬁle of the tangential veloc-
ity is similar to what is found in observations or with what is obtained in
empirical models and numerical simulations. These favorable comparisons
are valid in the case of mature, quasi-stationary tropical cyclones, after the
phases of genesis and dynamic intensiﬁcation.

In addition, the numerical study of Eq.(1) reveals the existence of metastable

states (quasi-solutions) consisting of (a) extremely concentrated vortical ﬂows,
similar to the cross section of a tornado and (b) collection of vortices with
symmetric positions in plane (vortex crystals).

The numerical studies carried out until now are organized in the form of
several scaling relations connecting vortex characteristics to the few param-
eters of the Eq.(1). They may be used for comparison with observation or
with more complex theoretical models.

2 The physical model and the ﬁeld theoreti-

cal description

In this section we brieﬂy recall the origin of Eq.(1). It is useful to consider ﬁrst
the ideal ﬂuid described by the Euler equation, for which it has been shown
that it evolves at relaxation toward a very ordered ﬂow pattern, consisting
of two (positive and negative) vortices. This state persists for long times,
being limitted by only the eﬀect of some residual dissipation. From numerical
simulations it has also been inferred the form of the ﬂow function. It has been

3

found that the streamfunction ψ (x, y) obeys, in these states, the sinh-Poisson
equation, an equation which has very special properties.
It is an exactly
integrable equation (by Inverse Scattering Transform) and is connected with a
wide range of fundamental systems, like the Thirring lattice of spins in plane,
the aﬃne Toda system, the Gauss-Codazzi equations for embedding a surface
in three dimensional space, etc. David Montgomery and his collaborators
have developed a theoretical statistical model which explains the appearence
of this equation in this context (Kraichnan and Montgomery 1980, Fyfe,
Montgomery and Joyce 1976, Joyce and Montgomery 1973, Montgomery
and Joyce 1974, Montgomery et al. 1992).

It is generally
×
accepted (but not yet mathematically proved) that the Euler ﬂuid may be
described by an equivalent model, consisting of a set of discrete point-like
vortices moving in plane under the eﬀect of mutual interaction. The latter
is expressed by a potential given by the natural logarithm of the relative
distance between vortices normalized to the linear extension of the region in
plane where the motion is bounded (Kraichnan and Montgomery 1980). A
fundamental observation is that this formulation exhibits a particular struc-
ture: matter, ﬁeld, interaction. The matter corresponds to the density of
point-like vortices in plane; the ﬁeld is derived from the potantial and can
be seen as an independent component of the system; the interaction appears
as the usual combination of the matter current with the potential and leads
to the equation of motion of the point-like vortices. The sinh-Poisson equa-
tion has been derived by formulating the continuum version of the point-like
vortices model as a ﬁeld theoretical model of interacting gauge and matter
ﬁelds in the adjoint representation of SU (2) (Spineanu and Vlad 2003). The
essential point of the latter derivation was the self-duality of the relaxation
states of the ﬂuid.

Similar to the Euler equation there is a discrete vortex model for the Charney-
Hasegawa-Mima equation, where the potential of interaction is now short
range (the modiﬁed Bessel function of zero order), i.e. it decays on the range

b

given by the intrinsic length of the CHM equation. This model has been used
in meteorology by Morikawa (Morikawa 1960) and Stewart (Stewart 1943).

In a similar approach as for the Euler ﬂuid, it has been developed (Spineanu
and Vlad 2005) a ﬁeld theoretical model for the continuous version of the
point-like vortices with short range interaction, based on the Chern-Simons
action for the gauge ﬁeld in interaction with the nonlinear matter ﬁeld, in
the adjoint representation of the SU (2) algebra. In this model it is possible
to derive the energy as a functional that becomes extremum on a subset of
stationary states and presents particular properties. The general character-
ization of this family of states is their self-duality, which here means that
the energy functional becomes minimum when the squared terms in its ex-
pression are all vanishing, leaving as lower bound for energy a quantity with
topological meaning, proportional with the total vorticity.

The result is a set of equations parametrized by the solutions of the
Laplace equation in two-dimensions. The Eq.(1) is the simplest of this family.

3 Numerical studies

To solve Eq.(1) we use the code “GIANT A software package for the numer-
ical solution of very large systems of highly nonlinear systems” written by
U. Nowak and L. Weimann (Nowak and Weiman 1990). The code is part
of the numerical software library CodeLib of the Konrad Zuse Zentrum fur
Informationstechnik Berlin. The meaning of the abbreviation is: GIANT =
Global Inexact Aﬃne Invariant Newton Techniques. This code solves non-
linear problems

initial guess of solution, ψ = ψ(0)

F (ψ) = 0

(4)

where F (ψ) is a nonlinear partial diﬀerential operator. The integrations
described here are not radial (i.e. unidimensional) which is very important
since from certain initial conditions solutions consisting of multiple vortices
develop. The presence of the hyperbolic trigonometric functions, with very
fast variation with the argument, renders the equation diﬃcult to solve and
many initial conditions do not lead to a solution since they cannot initiate a
converging iteration. With all the diﬃculties of ﬁnding a right initialization
of the integration procedure we note however that the solution with the
morphology of a tropical cyclone appears insistently from a wide class of
initial functions which contains vortical ﬂows.

3.1 Parameters and Initializations

Eq.(1) has been derived from the self-duality subset of the Euler-Lagrange
variational equations for the action functional of the ﬁeld-theoretical model.
In this action there are only two physical parameters: the coeﬃcient of the
Chern-Simons action, which we have identiﬁed as the sound speed, cs and the
asymptotic vorticity which is the Coriolis frequency f0 (or, in plasma physics,
the ion cyclotron frequency Ωci). The space-like parameter that normalizes
the Laplace operator in the Eq.(1) is the ratio

i.e. the Rossby radius ρg (respectively the sonic Larmor radius in plasma,
ρs = cs/Ωci). All distances implied in the solution are normalized ρg. The
streamfunction is normalised as (the upperscript phys is used to indicate that
the quantity is dimensional)

ρg = cs/f0

ψ =

ψphys
ρ2
gf0

The unit for the streamfunction is ρ2
the unit for velocity is ρgf0.

gf0 and the unit for vorticity f0. Then

If we know the large radial extension of a vortex (Lphys) the normalized
parameter L is obtained by dividing to ρg. The result of integration is very
sensitive to L and this points out the essential role played by ρg in numerical
studies aiming to reproduce observations. When the depth of the atmo-
spheric perturbation is H, the Rossby radius is ρg = (gH)1/2 /f0 (where g
is the gravitational acceleration). Actually ρg is inﬂuenced by several other
parameters than H, in particular the vorticity and it can have a range from
tens to thousand kilometers. When combined with the range of vortex exten-
sions Lphys, it results that L has a range between a fraction of unity to few
units (in plasma L can be hundreads to thousands). For mature stationary
cyclones the radial extension of the cyclon vortex and the Rossby radius are
of similar magnitude and this means that we have to study the range L
1.

the condition is ψb = 0. This means zero vorticity at the boundary but it
has defavorable eﬀect on the velocity ﬁeld, which does not allways vanish at
the border.

In general the initial proﬁles have been of various types: (a) symmetric
proﬁles (e.g. Gaussian functions, or various annular shapes) with maximum
centered on (0, 0), or the Petviashvili-Pokhotelov vortex, Eq.(8) below; (b)
functions expressed as product of trigonometric functions; or (c) collections of
localised vortex-like perturbations placed randomly. In this work we report
results obtained for initializations with vorticity of the same sign over all
the space region. It has resulted that the monopolar vortex which may be
relevant for the atmosphere physics can actually be obtained as a solution
of the convergent iteration from a large class of initial conditions, of various
shapes belonging to the three classes mentioned above. However, in terms
of a set of parameters describing any of the classes of initialization, ﬁnding
the convergence (solution) proves to be complicated and ﬁnding a solution is
rather exceptional. It can be said that the regions favorable to convergence
in the space of initial function are intricate and have sharp limits.

In order to simulate the formation of a vortex the main series of runs
reported here have adopted as initial function (from which the iteration of
GIANT starts) a monopolar, circularly symmetric form characterized by few
parameters, the Petviashvili-Pokhotelov vortex

shape, ψ0 is the amplitude and ψb is the boundary value. The reason to
choose the form (8) is connected with the set of equation (continuity and
conservation of momentum) from which the CHM equation is originally de-
rived.
It has been shown by a multiple space-time scale analysis that the
late stage evolution of the full set of equation is dominated by mesoscopic
scales (of the order √Lnρs where Ln is a typical length of the gradient of
the equilibrium density) where a diﬀerent nonlinear mechanism is present.
Instead of the nonlinearity term in (3) there is a scalar or Korteweg-DeVries
nonlinearity of the type ψ ∂ψ
∂x in one dimension, and the equation actually is
replaced by the Flierl-Petviashvili equation (see for example Spineanu et al.
2004). Or, this equation has a solution expressed as Eq.(8). As initial func-
tion, Eq.(8) has some advantages:
it has physical relevance for the system
which is behind the stationary states emerging from Eq.(3); it is a vortical
structure, as those which may be expected to form spontaneously in real sit-
uations; and it has few parameters which we take as coordinates in a space
of initial functions that must be sampled to ﬁnd solutions.

The parameters of the equation and of the initial function, which com-
pletely deﬁnes a numerical experiment, are: (a) half the length of the side of
the square area taken as region of integration, L = Lphys/ρg; (b) the constant
of the equation which in these runs is taken p = 1. This implies that the
boundary condition for the streamfunction, which also means zero vorticity,
is ψ(1,2)

The choice of an initial amplitude ψ0 favorable for reaching a solution
is made easier if we use the following formula connecting the radius of the

this maximum ψ0:

This formula can be derived by simple manipulations of the equation (1),
together with approximations that are made possible by some numerical
experience about the orders of magnitude of the normalized quantities. It is
a rather poor but useful approximation and only works for L . 3, a range
which is interesting for the atmospheric vortex.

From the other types of initial proﬁles we brieﬂy discuss the second one.
As suggested by the numerical study of the sinh-Poisson equation the ini-
tial function has been taken in several runs as a product of trigonometric
functions in both directions, x and y. We need to prepare the initial func-
tion in the sense that the values that are obtained for the vorticity, i.e. the
Laplacean of the initial ψ should not be too diﬀerent of what is obtained
by simply inserting the initial function in the nonlinear term. The initial
function is taken as

where xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax are the limits of the domain Eq.(7), k is the
periodicity of the proﬁle and ψ0 is the amplitude. Eq.(10) is inserted in
Eq.(1) and one requires approximative equality of the two parts, the vorticity
and the nonlinearity. This is obtained by choosing a point (x, y) where the
initial function is maximum and it results a condition on only the amplitude,
ψ0.

4 Results

4.1 Summary of the numerical results

The strong nonlinear character of Eq.(1) combined with the internal proce-
dures of GIANT (with no physical signiﬁcance) imprints a particular struc-
ture to a space of functions that is explored for exact solutions. The space of
functions representing initial conditions are devided into disjoint parts, such
that from one subset one cannot access the ﬁnal conﬁguration of another
subset. This means that in order to obtain a particular type of stationary
(asymptotic) solution one has to initialize in a particular subset, homotopi-
cally connected to the ﬁnal state. Most of the initial conditions does not lead
to convergence and possibly they correspond to turbulent physical states. Ex-
act solutions are obtained in the form of trivial (ψ
0) state and monopolar
or multipolar vortices.

≡

Besides exact solutions there are sets of functions that are almost solu-
tions, i.e. velocity ﬁeld conﬁgurations that verify the equation with only low
accuracy and are normally rejected by the integration procedure at smaller
tolerance. They are interesting because they appear systematically and ap-
proximately exhibit the same characteristics for a ﬁxed L. The iteration of
GIANT gets almost stuck around such a solution, which may suggest that
they are metastable states of the physical ﬂuid and eventually evolve slowly
toward an exact solution, a smooth vortex. We call them quasi-solutions and
we ﬁnd useful to include them in our discussion.

Restricting to the case of monopolar vortices we summarize the results

by saying that for every L we obtain two types of ﬁnal vortices:

1. smooth, ﬁnite amplitude, vortices verifying the equation for any change
in the accuracy of the integration procedure. There is a unique smooth
vortex conﬁguration for each L.

2. quasi-solutions, consisting of strongly localised vortices, with proﬁles
for velocity and vorticity that are much narrower compared with the
smooth vortices. These quasi-solutions are persistently obtained and it
seems that there is only one conﬁguration for each L.

4.2 Solutions with the morphology of tropical cyclones

We are focusing here on the type of solutions that exhibit strong similarities
with the morphology of a horizontal cross section of a tropical cyclone. These
are circular symmetric solutions with a strong maximum of the tangential
velocity, strong concentration of vorticity.

Taking for ilustration the smooth vortex obtained for L = 1.25 we note
that the solution has cylindrical symmetry around the center. Fig.1 presents
a section of the streamfunction ψ (x, y) along the diagonal of the domain
(x, y). A section of the vorticity ω (x, y) is presented in Fig.2.

In order to quantify the accuracy of integration we collect in all the do-

the nonlinear term in Eq.(1), Fig.3. The scatterplot of (ψ, ω) is almost su-
perposed on this line. The scatterplot of the pairs [ω,
1)]
(not shown) indicates a close clustering around the diagonal. Other tests
are possible and they show that the integration is very good on most of the
region and good within the imposed accuracy in the regions where the second
derivative is very high.

with the extension of the whole domain.

We have ploted in Fig.5 the section along the diagonal of the amplitude

of the azimuthal component of the velocity.

In general the radial component of the velocity is much smaller than the
vθ| ∼

azimuthal component. For this example (L = 1.25) is in a ratio
0.4/4 = 1/10 and integrated over a circle shows no net inﬂow to the axis.

The large amount of results for the range of L : 0 < L

10, allows to
formulate two remarks. First we note that for larger L the proﬁle of the
azimuthal velocity shows smaller amplitude and larger radius of the circle of
maximum velocity. Second, this variation with L is much faster for low L
(less or comparable to 1). The diﬀerences in the quantitative characteristics
of the vortices for even small variation of L in this range are substantial.
Below we provide a scaling which shows exponential behavior, Eq.(12).

4.3 Quasi-solutions : strongly localised vortices

For comparison we present the proﬁles of the solution ψ (x, y) Fig.6, vortic-
ity ω (x, y) Fig.7 and azimuthal velocity vθ (x, y) Fig.8 for the quasi-solution
that correspnds to the same L = 1.25. The sections are along the diag-
onal, denoted r. One should note that the total vorticity (obtained by
integrating over the square) is however smaller than that for the corre-
sponding smooth vortex shown in the preceding ﬁgures. The total energy
E = (2L)
1, is larger for the concen-
trated vortices compared to the smooth ones.

4.4 Quasi-solutions : multiple vortices

There are episodic structures of multiple vortices that are detected as so-
lutions under a certain precision and which however evlove to symmetric
monopolar vortex when the system is allowed to run further, under a higher
precision.

It is worth to mention that in a numerical experiment we have identiﬁed a
state where two vortices have been formed, placed in symmetrical positions
along the diagonal of the square domain L = 0.5. The initial function is
trigonometric with k = 2 in Eq.(10) with a coeﬃcient ψ0 = 3.8. Examining
this structure with higher precision, after a longer iteration sequence the ﬁnal
solution was again the centered smooth vortex known for L = 0.5. Therefore
from the point of view of the numerical experience this state of two vortices
is irrelevant. However, the persistence of this state inside the iterative search
may indicate that it is close to a solution, possible less structurally stable.

Four vortices have been obtained in a run starting from trigonometric
initial function. The initial function is trigonometric Eq.(10) with k = 3.
The results show the formation of four vortices, as shown by Fig.9. Each
of them has a structure that is similar to the one presented in Fig.1. It is
interesting to note that again the vorticity is almost zero everywhere on the
domain, except the regions of the four vortices, where it reaches very high
values. The local tangential velocity presents the same very fast decay to
the center of the vortex and each vortex is similar in structure with a typical
cyclone.

5 Scaling laws inferred from numerical re-

sults

As mentioned before the nontrivial results of monopolar vortices are sys-
tematically of two types: a smooth vortex solution and a strongly localised
quasi-solution. These are always the same for a ﬁxed L. Their characteristics
strongly depends on L, especially for the lower part of the range, where L is
few units or less.

Since the monopolar ﬁnal states are independent of the initial conditions
from which we start and of the particular numerical method of solution (GI-
ANT) the scaling relations between the characteristics of the ﬁnal vortices
are objective and reﬂect properties of the equation itself. In addition the re-
sults (smooth vortex and narrow quasi-solution) are unique for a particular
L, suggesting we can collect all numerical results in a form of nomograms
or analytic (eventually spline functions) ﬁt. However, we will look instead
for analytic formulas which, even approximative, are simpler to use. We
examine (a) the scaling of the maximum tangential velocity with the length
of the space domain, L; (b) the scaling of the radius of the eye-wall of the
atmospheric vortex with the length L. Finally we will examine the existence
of a linear relation between the energy and the vorticty in the ﬁnal states.

For α = 0.97 this scaling works better for L around 1, and is a poor
approximation over the range less than 0.4. At L & 1.5 this formula over-
estimates the maximum velocity and will not be used when we dispose, for
the particular L, of the full numerical set as obtained by GIANT. However
many observational data fall in the range L
1 where Eq.(12) is a good ﬁt
and there it may be useful for a rapid estimation.

5.2 The scaling of the radius of the eye-wall with the

extension of the atmospheric vortex

On the basis of many runs we have tried to infer a possible relation between
the radius of the eyewall, (the radius of the circle where the tangential velocity
is maximum) and the parameter L.

16

When the data collected for a larger range of L, 0 < L

6, is taken
into account, it appears that there is an approximative linear dependence of
rvmax

As can be seen from Fig.12 this linear ﬁt is too approximative and in
particular does not work well for low L, 0 < L . 2.5. Or this is the range
that is relevant for the atmospheric vortex.
It is necessary to look for a
diﬀerent ﬁt for that range.

In our rectangular geometry it seems more appropriate to take as a spatial
extension (instead of L) the distance from the center where the velocity is
zero, i.e. half the diagonal of the domain of integration

Rmax ∼

and to normalize the eye-wall radius to this distance. Then the same numer-

5.3 Energy and vorticity in the ﬁnal states

The smooth and respectively the concentrated vortices are persistently ob-
tained, from a wide variety of initial conditions. This suggests that, apart
variations due to the accuracy of the iteration process, these states really
represent a stationary state and respectively a quasi-stationary state of the
ﬂuid. Their characteristics are completely determined once we have ﬁxed the
spatial extension of the domain, the length L, which is half the side of the
square on which the integration is performed, with ψ = 0 on its boundaries.

In particular the ﬁnal states for a ﬁxed L are characterised by two quan-
tities, the total ﬁnal energy and the total ﬁnal vorticity and there are two
pairs (Ef in, Ωf in): one for the smooth vortex and one for the narrow vortex.
When these pairs are collected from all numerical experiences for a particular
L, the precision of numerical determination of the solution is reﬂected in the
dispersion of the points around an average one which may be supposed to
be the exact solution. For the smooth vortices the dispersion is insigniﬁant,
conﬁrming that the numerical identiﬁcation of this solution is very good, for

ent and is connected with the higher magnitude of the second derivative on a
very small area. However the results are clearly clustered around an average
value which one can use to study various scaling relations. This diﬀerence
is exempliﬁed in Fig.14 showing 130 results for L = 1.25, both smooth and
narrow vortices. The black dot indicated by the arrow actually consists of
84 distinct dots representing almost identical results for the smooth vortex
at L = 1.25. The open circles are 46 quasi-solutions narrow vortices, which
have very close characteristics (vθ (x, y), rvmax
,etc.). They clearly represent
approximations of a unique quasi-solution. The dispersion in the ﬁnal en-
ergy and vorticity are a consequence of diﬀerences in the calculated second
derivative of ψ on a very small area, the reason for which they are actually
rejected by GIANT. In Fig.15) data are plotted for several values of L.

Figure 16: Energy and vorticity in the ﬁnal states corresponding to strongly
localized vortices are plotted in logarithmic scale, (ln(Ef in), ln(
)). The
Ωf in|
dashed line has slope 1 which means that Ef in is proportional to Ωf in.

|

The ﬁrst important relation is between the energy Ef in and the vorticity
Ωf in in the ﬁnal states. The ﬁeld theoretical model from which the equation
is derived points out the existence of a lower bound for the energy functional
for the point-like vortices: the energy is expressed as a sum of squared terms
plus a supplementary term that has a topological content. The minimum of
the energy is obtained by taking the squared terms to zero (and this leads
to the self-dual equations and further to Eq.(1)) and this makes the energy
equal to the topological term. Integrating on all plane this equality takes

20

the form of a proportionality of the total energy and the total vorticity in
the ﬂuid motion. Therefore the numerical results collected for all L should
exhibit a linear relationship between Ef in and Ωf in. Now we have for each
L two pairs (Ef in, Ωf in) and we can try to verify this linear relations for
both. The total vorticity can be calculated easily in both cases, since the
vorticity has a very good spatial limitation around the eye and decays rapidly
to zero. The total energy is calculated by integrating the squared velocity
but the square domain of integration actually does not have everywhere zero
velocity at the boundary, especially for higher L. Then a certain amount
of energy cannot be included and Ef in is not reliable. This is the case with
0.25...0.5,
almost all smooth vortices (except possibly the very small L
where the localization of the smooth vortex is more pronounced). However,
for the strongly localized vortices this problem does not arise, for any L.
Fig.16 shows that there is indeed a linear relation between the energy and
the vorticity. It is visible from this log-log plot of the pairs, where the dashed
line has slope 1.

∼

With the reserves that have been formulated above, one can still look
for a possible relation between the ﬁnal energy and vorticity in the case of
smooth vortices as results from the numerical integration. For the range of
L up to 6 Fig.17 shows the data of the smooth vortices in log-log scale.

This is represented in Fig.18. The fact that it refers to velocity proﬁles

formula.

5.4 The existence of a threshold in the initial energy

and vorticity for obtaining a solution

Numerical simulations of basic ﬂuid equations have shown that there is a
boundary in the space of the initial conﬁgurations which separates two kinds
of behaviors: on one side there are states from which the ﬂuid evolves to ran-
dom, turbulent states and on the other side there are initial conﬁgurations
giving in long run organised, highly ordered ﬂow with a vortical pattern. In
the case of the Navier-Stokes equation this limit has been called the ergodic

22

boundary by Deem and Zabusky (1971). In our case there is no time evolu-
tion and the iterations of GIANT have no particular physical meaning. We
simply note however that a similar separation occurs in the present case. For
any ﬁxed L the iteration of GIANT converges to a smooth vortex only if the
amplitude of the initial function ψ0 is higher than a particular value, depend-
ing on the peaking parameter δ. This can be translated into a condition for
the initial energy and vorticity. Choosing L = 0.5 we have represented in
Fig.19 the points (Eini, Ωini) corresponding to all types of ﬁnal results: zero
(asterisk), smooth vortex (open circles), narrow quasi-solution (black dots).

6 Practical application of the scaling laws

In this section we discuss how to use the scaling relations we have derived
when we want to compare with a real observational data of a tropical cyclone.
Since for a ﬁxed L the integration provides a unique smooth vortex, all
data regarding this vortex are available in the form of functions : ψ (x, y),
, Ef in, Ωf in. All are
ω (x, y), vθ (x, y), and derived quantities : rvmax
normalized and the ﬁrst task is to identify the physical units that will relate
these quantities to the physical data. Basically there are two units: ρg and
f0 and the latter is assumed known.

, vmax
θ

θ

A possible starting point is to estimate (from observations) the ratio
between the radius of the circle of maximum azimuthal velocity rphys
and
vmax
θ
the radius of the minimum disc containing the cyclone, Rphys
max (here as usual
the upperscript phys means that the quantities are dimensional). Suppose
this ratio can be estimated on the basis of a satelite picture. Then we can use
Eq.(15) or Fig.13 to identify the parameter L. Since a real-life observation
provides also the physical radius of the cyclone, Rphys
max we can determine
max = √2Lphys = √2ρgL where we use L as
the Rossby radius from: Rphys
determined. Then the unit of the physical quantities are calculated : ρgf0
for velocity and ρ2
gf0 for the streamfunction. From the runs of the code
for L we dispose of proﬁles for all (normalized) variables. Using the units
we can calculate some characteristics that can be further compared with
the observations: the maximum azimuthal velocity vphys
max , the proﬁle of the
velocity, the vorticity, etc.

6.1 Example 1

We use pictures of the proﬁle of the mean tangential wind for the hurri-
cane Andrew, according to Willoughby and Black 1996.

reference it is represented the west to east wind proﬁle before the eyewall

From these examples we conclude that the results of the estimations can
be signiﬁcantly aﬀected by the approximations on the observational data,

especially that of the ratio rvmax
which is obtained from Eq.(15) using a reasonable input value for this ratio
belongs to a range where the variations with L of all the characteristics of
the solution (ψ, ω, vθ, rvmax
) are substantial. It is suﬃcient to look at the

7 Discussion

At the origin of our approach it is the Charney-Hasegawa-Mima model, a two-
dimensional, nondissipative and purely ﬂuid-dynamical (no thermal process)
model. Although is a simpliﬁed model it exhibits (via the ﬁeld-theoretical
formulation) a compact analytic and algebraic structure, self-duality, leading
to Eq.(1). We have several arguments in favor of the conclusion that Eq.(1)
may represent the ﬂuid nonlinear-dynamic part of the atmospheric vortex.
First, the proﬁles obtained by solving Eq.(1) are similar to results already
known (from observations or numerical simulation) for the same quantities.

26

1. The proﬁle of the the tangential velocity, our Fig.5, is similar to typical
tropical cyclone velocity proﬁles, as represented in Fig.2 of Wang and
Wu 2004. This is also conﬁrmed by close similarity with the Fig.1a from
Reasor and Montgomery 2001 and with the proﬁle given by the Holland
model or with the experimental observation (for Andrew hurricane,
Willoughby and Black 1996).

2. The fast decay to zero of the vorticity ω shown in our Fig.2 is similar to
what is shown in Fig.1a of Kossin and Schubert 2001; ideally (without
dissipation and friction) for mature hurricanes the maximum of ω is on
the center.

3. We note that in a series of reported numerical simulations, the ten-
dency of the ﬁelds is to evolve toward proﬁles that are very close to
those shown in our ﬁgures 2 and 5. For example, the Fig.7a and 7b
of Kossin and Schubert 2001 show the evolution of the vorticity and
mean of the tangential velocity from initial proﬁles which correspond to
a narrow ring of vorticity to proﬁles that show clear ressemblance with
our ﬁgures 2 and 5. The same striking evolution to proﬁles similar to
ours appears in Figs.7 a and b of the same Reference. We have investi-
gated whether a radially annular proﬁle of vorticity can be a solution of
our equation (1). The result is negative, which may explain why such
an initial proﬁle evolves to either a set of vortices (vortex-crystal) or
to a centrally peaked structure as in Fig.2.

Second, we obtain a good consistency between our quantitative results
for an atmospheric vortex (using approximative input information) and the
values measured or obtained in numerical simulations.

Finally, the quasi-solutions which appear to be an interesting feature of
this equation, are compatible with a series of previously known results: the
four vortices represented in our ﬁgure 10 are similar to the Figure 4a from
the work of Kossin and Schubert 2001. And the evolution to a monopolar
structure we obtain is similar to the same process reported in this reference.

The numerical results have made possible to formulate several scaling
relations connecting parameters of the atmospheric vortex. These are simple
formulas, intended for practical use, inevitably approximative and contain
a certain amount of arbitrariness. This is because our purpose was to infer
an analytical expression for a curve which is determined numerically (or: is
known in the form of a simple table of values). Other expressions are possible
and are worth to look for. A true scaling law will become possible only as
a result of an analytical
investigation of the properties of the equation. On

27

the other hand, this equation does not have a Backlund transform and is
probable not integrable the Inverse Scattering Transform.

An important ﬁeld of future investigation (analytical and numerical) is
represented by the quasi-solutions, elements of a space of functions that ap-
parently come very close of verifying the equation. Are they close to the
extremum of the action functional of the full ﬁeld-theoretical model, for ex-
ample, are they metastable states? From the physical point of view it may
result that these states can be rendered more stable by processes that are
connected with what is missing from the Charney-Hasegawa-Mima model:
third dimension, viscosity, thermal processes. It is worth to examine the role
of the strongly localized quasi-solutions in models of tornadoes.

Developing from the present one, a future self-consistent model will have
to include variation of the Rossby radius with the dynamical properties of
the vortex. Since this implies to consider that the coeﬃcient of the Chern-
Simons part in the Lagrangian is a nonlinear function of the scalar ﬁeld, it
is diﬃcult to say if the self-duality will be maintained.

The investigation of this equation, and, most important, of the ﬁeld-

theoretical model from which it is derived, are worth to be continued.

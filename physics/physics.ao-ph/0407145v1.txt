Abstract

We present an analysis of seasonal cycle of the last 50 years of

records of surface temperature in Italy. We consider two data sets

which synthesize the surface temperature ﬁelds of Northern and South-

ern Italy. Such data sets consist of records of daily maximum and

minimum temperature. We compute the best estimate of the seasonal

cycle of the variables considered by adopting the cyclograms’ tech-

nique. We observe that in general the minimum temperature cycle

lags behind the maximum temperature cycle, and that the cycles of

the Southern Italy temperatures records lag behind the corresponding

cycles referring to Northern Italy. All seasonal cycles lag consider-

ably behind the solar cycle. The amplitude and phase of the seasonal

cycles do not show any statistically signiﬁcant trend in the time inter-

val considered.

1. Introduction

The analysis of the seasonal cycle of temperature records is of the uttermost im-

portance in order to provide a detailed description of the climate of the geographi-

cal area under consideration. A correct approach to the evaluation of the seasonal

signal allows to have a clearer picture of changes in such a signal and at the same

time permits a more precise position of the problem of estimating the statistical

properties, in terms of short-time variability, long-term trend, and extremes, of the

residual signal.

In particular, the possibility of capturing with greater detail the properties

of the seasonal signal is especially relevant for the analysis of regions, like the

Mediterranean area, that are characterized by relevant intermittence. The presence

of noticeable year-to-year variations for the seasonal cycle in the Italian peninsula

has been observed and reported in some of the most relevant treatises of the past,

from Roman Age - in Plinius the Old’s Naturalis Historia - to early XIX century

- in Leopardi’s Zibaldone.

In this study we analyze the seasonal cycle for a 50-year period (1951-2000) of

the maximum and minimum temperature records of two synthetic stations series,

which synthesize the information regarding Northern and Southern Italy. The data

have been derived from daily observations of temperatures taken in 64 stations

covering the Italian peninsula.

In order to provide the statistical description of the seasonal signal of any

record, able to quantify the mean seasonal cycle and as well as the properties of

3

its short- and long-term variability, we must have several, well deﬁned sampled

estimates of its fundamental characteristics, namely phase and amplitude.

In these terms, the application of the Discrete Fourier Transform (henceforth,

DFT) on the entire record is of relatively little use, since it provides only the

best - in terms of fraction of the total variance - global estimate of the phase and

amplitude of the 1y−1 frequency component, while no information is given on the

variability of the seasonal cycle.

For each record, we estimate the seasonal component throughout the record

by considering the collection of all the local (in time) best estimate of seasonal

cycle. Such an approach is along the lines of the statistical technique proposed

when introducing the cyclograms (Attolini et al. 1984; Galli 1988). The resulting

seasonal signal is not precisely periodic, since the phase and the amplitude of the

computed sinusoidal curve are not constant. Therefore it is possible to statistically

analyze how the amplitude and phase of the seasonal signal vary with time.

Such an approach is viable because our data obey with the narrow band ap-

proximation, i.e. in each subset of the data used for the local estimates, the spec-

trum of the data has a sharp, narrow peak for the 1y−1 frequency component, so

that the phase and amplitude of the seasonal cycle are well deﬁned.

We wish underline that very recently sophisticated DFT-based techniques,

which follow a different approach than ours, have been proposed to assess si-

multaneously the diurnal, seasonal and long-term variability of climate records

(Vinnikov et al. 2003).

Our paper is organized as follows.

In section 2 we describe the data sets

4

considered in this work. In section 3 we describe how it is possible to analyze

a given frequency component of a signal by considering a collection of its local

estimates. In section 4 we present the analysis of the seasonal cycles of the data. In

section 5 we present an analysis of the signiﬁcativity of the trends of the estimated

phase and amplitude of the seasonal signals. In section 6 we present the analysis

of the de-seasonalized data. In section 7 we present our conclusions.

2. Data description

The data used in this study are derived from a set of station records with daily min-

imum and maximum temperature observations for a 50-year period (1951-2000).

They were extracted from the Italian Air Force (Aeronautica Militare, henceforth

AM) climatic database, that was recently used for the study of Italian daily pre-

cipitation (Brunetti et al. 2001, 2002); cloud cover (Maugeri et al. 2001) and sea

level pressure (Maugeri et al. 2003) as well. The AM climatic database includes

164 stations. Some of them, however, cover only rather short periods, other ones

have a large number of missing data. Since we are interested in providing infor-

mation on the Italian climatology, we have selected a subset of the stations which

give a reasonable coverage of Italy and which are provided with long and reliable

records. The result was a subset of 64 stations. The selected records were quality-

checked and in order to increase the conﬁdence of the results, homogenization

was based, not only on AM records, but also on records derived from other data

sources such as Ufﬁcio Centrale di Ecologia Agraria, Servizio Idrograﬁco, and

5

some speciﬁc research project that allowed daily series to be recovered for several

of the most important Italian observatories.

EOF analysis, which will be fully reported in a future publication, shows that

the daily maximum and minimum temperature data ﬁelds can be reduced with a

good degree of approximation to two degrees of freedom. In both cases, these

degrees of freedom contribute to over 90% of the variance of the signal. The ﬁrst

two principal components are representative of the two geographically distinct

areas of Northern and Southern Italy. Therefore, it has been possible to create two

synthetic data sets for Northern and Southern Italy, which henceforth we refer

to as station N and station S temperature records, respectively. Each of the 64

stations has been assigned to either station N or station S on the basis of a score.

Then the station N and station S synthetic data sets have been created by suitably

averaging the data of the corresponding stations. Each resulting data set consists

of the records of daily maximum and minimum temperature, which are henceforth

indicated as T N/S

max and T N/S

min , with obvious meaning of the indexes. These data are

depicted in ﬁgure 1. Qualitatively, the geographic boundary dividing the stations

contributing respectively to the station N and S data sets is along the parallel

between Firenze (Tuscany) and Bologna (Emilia Romagna).

3. Local estimate of a given frequency component

We consider the statistical approach related to the technique of cyclograms (Attolini et al.

1984; Galli 1988). Such an approach provides the possibility of capturing the

6

amplitude and phase time-dependent variations of a given frequency sine wave

component of the signal under examination Attolini et al. (1985, 1989).

Given a signal x (t), t = 1, . . . , N, a frequency 2π/τ and a time window

2T + 1, we consider the centered moving average over 2T + 1 terms of the series

{x (t) exp [−i2πt/τ ]}:

a (t; τ, T ) =

x (j) exp [−i2πj/τ ] ,

(1)

1
2T + 1

t+T

Xj=t−T

where T + 1 ≤ t ≤ N − T since the signal has N samplings.

If the frequency 2π/τ is an integer multiple of 2π/N, we have that a (t; τ, T )

can be expressed as the DFT of a suitably convolution product:

a (t; τ, T ) =

DF T [x ∗ w] (2π/τ )

(2)

N
2T + 1

where the ﬁrst factor is a renormalization constant, ∗ represents the convolution

product, and w is the weighting function:

w (t) =

0, T + 2 ≤ t ≤ N − T

(3)

2T +1,

1 ≤ t ≤ T + 1

1

2T +1, N − T + 1 ≤ t ≤ N






Equations (1-2) imply that, if 2π/τ belongs to the discrete spectrum of the signal,

and if 2T + 1 ≥ τ , a (t; τ, T ) is related to the best estimate of the 2π/τ frequency

sine S (t, 2π/τ ) and cosine C (t, 2π/τ ) wave components of the portion t − T ≤

7

t ≤ t + T of the signal x (t) as follows:

C (t, 2π/τ ) =

Re [a (t; τ, T )]

S (t, 2π/τ ) = −

Im [a (t; τ, T )]

2
2T + 1
2
2T + 1

where Re and Im indicate the real and imaginary part, respectively. Therefore, we

can construct a global best estimate of the 2π/τ frequency signal Σ (t, 2π/τ ) for

each value of T + 1 ≤ t ≤ N − T by considering all the local best estimates

obtained using the result contained in equation (4):

Σ (t, 2π/τ ) = C (t, 2π/τ ) cos (2πt/τ ) + S (t, 2π/τ ) sin (2πt/τ )

= A (t, 2π/τ ) cos (2πt/τ + φ (t, 2π/τ )) ,

where:

A (t, 2π/τ ) =

C (t, 2π/τ )

+ S (t, 2π/τ )

We can reasonably extend the function Σ (t, 2π/τ ) to the whole range t = 1, . . . , N

(4)

in the following way:






A (T + 1, 2π/τ ) cos (2πt/τ + φ (T + 1, 2π/τ )) ,

t < T + 1

Σ (t, 2π/τ ) =

Σ (t, 2π/τ ) , T + 1 ≤ t ≤ N − T

A (N − T, 2π/τ ) cos (2πt/τ + φ (N − T, 2π/τ )) ,

t > N − T
(9)

Since the coefﬁcients of the sine and cosine waves change with t, the signal

Σ (t, 2π/τ ) is not purely periodic, i.e. its DFT does not have 2π/τ as only nonzero

component. Obviously, the more persistent with t are the phase and amplitude of

the local estimates of the 2π/τ signal, the more monochromatic is Σ (t, 2π/τ ).

Phase cyclograms (Attolini et al. 1984; Galli 1988) provide a very synthetic

way of picturing the phase variations of the selected frequency components of the

signals. The x− and y− components of the phase cyclogram of a signal can be

constructed in the following way:

P HX (t, 2π/τ ) =

C (j, 2π/τ ) /A (j, 2π/τ ) ,

P HY (t, 2π/τ ) =

S (j, 2π/τ ) /A (j, 2π/τ ) .

(10)

(11)

The more coherent in phase is the frequency component of the signal under ex-

amination, the more similar is the resulting graph to a straight line. In the limiting

case of a purely periodic signal we actually obtain a straight line, whose angle

with the horizontal axis is the phase of the signal, apart from a constant.

4. Seasonal cycles

In order to apply the techniques presented in the previous chapter to the tempera-

ture records T N

max, T S

max, T N

min, and T S

min we have performed a light preprocessing

procedure to the data. First of all, the four records presented few missing data,

ranging from a minimum of 3 (T N

max) to a maximum of 5 (T S

max). We have ﬁlled

the holes with simple linear interpolations. Moreover, in order to homogenize the

length of the years, we have suppressed the additional data of February occurring

in each of the 12 bissextile years of the time frame considered. Since these cor-

rections regard in each case less than 0.1% of the total record, we are conﬁdent

that this procedure does not alter relevantly the results later presented.

Since we are interested in evaluating the seasonal cycle, we consider in equa-

tion (6) τ = τ0 = 365. The most natural time window suitable for having a local

estimate of the seasonal cycle is clearly one year as well. Therefore, we select

2T + 1 = 2T0 + 1 = τ0 = 365. This choice for 2T + 1 implies that, following

equation (1), we have 49 × 365 + 1 local estimates of the seasonal cycle.

It is important to underline that such an approach is sensitive only if the signal

obeys the narrow band approximation, i.e. the spectrum of the signal has a strong,

narrow peak for the annual cyclic component. If, on the contrary, the signal were

characterized by a broad spectral feature comprising the 1y−1 frequency compo-

nent, it would be a mathematical nonsense to investigate whether the seasonal

cycle is changing. In such a case the seasonal cycle is just not deﬁned, because

several contiguous spectral components having different frequencies and shifting

10

phase differences give contributions of comparable importance.

The results we obtain for the amplitude signals are summarized in table 1 and

depicted in ﬁgure 2, while the results referring to the phase signals are reported in

table 2 and depicted in ﬁgure 3. In ﬁgure 4 we present the results obtained for the

function Σ (t, 2π/τ0) for the four records considered.

The ﬁrst result we want to point out is that there is no statistically signiﬁcant

linear trend in either the amplitude of the phase of the seasonal signal. In other

terms, our analysis suggests that in Italy in the time frame 1951-2000 seasons

have not changed in their annual evolution. The statistical analysis of the trend of

the signals is described in detail in a later subsection. We underline that in general

it is sensible to perform the analysis of the time-dependence of the seasonal signal

properties only if the record comprises several seasonal cycles. In our case such

condition is obeyed, since we have N ≫ 2T0 + 1.

The second result we wish to emphasize is that the amplitude of the seasonal

signal is signiﬁcantly larger for maximum than for minimum temperature, and

that is signiﬁcantly larger for variables referring to Northern Italy. Moreover, the

two effects roughly sum up linearly, i.e.:

where we have dropped the t- and τ -dependencies of A for sake of simplicity

and where the notation hi indicates the mean value. Another interesting result

is that for both N and S stations the seasonal signal of minimum temperature

11

has an average phase delay with respect to the seasonal signal of the maximum

temperature. Moreover, the seasonal cycle of the temperature records of station

S has a delay with respect to the seasonal cycle of the corresponding temperature

records of station N. Also in this case the two effect roughly sum up linearly:

(13)

≈ 0.7 ≈ 4d,

(14)

where we have expressed the phase differences in terms of calendar days d. The

maximum temperature record of station N is the closest in terms of phase delay to

the solar cycle, which constitutes a fundamental forcing to the system. Such delay

corresponds to ≈ 30d.

We present in ﬁgure 5 the cyclograms of the four signals T N

max, T S

max, T N

min, and

T S
min. In the same ﬁgure it is reported the phase cyclogram that can be constructed

from the rigorously periodic solar cycle signal, which can be expressed as follows:

SC (t) = cos (2π/τ0t + φ)

(15)

where φ is such that for t = 171 (corresponding to June 21st) the argument of

the cosine function is 0. We observe that in all four cases of the temperature

data sets the cyclograms are almost indistinguishable from straight lines, since

the t−dependent phase functions are essentially stationary. The above mentioned

average phase differences are the angles - measured counter clock-wise - between

the best straight line estimates of the cyclograms considered.

12

We can interpret these results in physical terms as follows. On one side, the

lag and different amplitudes of the cycles of maximum and minimum tempera-

tures can be related to the different impacts of changes of the two well-distinct

processes of day solar shortwave heating and night longwave cooling on the local

thermodynamic systems where measurements are taken, in terms of relations to

the thermal inertia. On the other side, larger scale thermal inertia effects related

to the different thermal properties of sea and land provide a qualitative argument

for the differences in amplitude and phase of the station N and S cycles, the main

reason being that Northern Italy is more continental than Southern Italy.

5. Estimation of the signiﬁcativity of the trends

We have followed a Montecarlo approach in order to assess the signiﬁcativity of

the computed trends for both the seasonal cycle amplitude A (t, 2π/τ0) and phase

φ (t, 2π/τ0) of the four temperature records analyzed.

Our procedure consists in adopting a null-hypothesis, so that we assume that

the considered quantity is a stationary autoregressive signals of order n, which

can in general be expressed as:

w (t) = m +

ckw (t − k) + η (t)

(16)

where η is a white spectrum noise with variance ση. We estimate for the con-

sidered quantity the optimal order n, as well as the optimal values of the relevant

n

Xk=1

13

parameters m, {ck}, and ση of the corresponding autoregressive process (16). This

can be performed, e.g. using a suitable MATLAB c(cid:13) routine (Neumaier and Schneider

2001; Schneider and Neumaier 2001). We wish to emphasize that the routine

(Neumaier and Schneider 2001; Schneider and Neumaier 2001) allows to estimate

the optimal n with either the Schwarz’s Bayesian criterion (Schwarz 1978) (hence-

forth, SBC) or the logarithm of Akaike’s ﬁnal prediction error (Akaike 1971)

(henceforth, FPE). The former approach gives consistently in all cases analyzed

smaller values for n. It has been shown in a simulation study that SBC is the most

efﬁcient in selecting the correct model order compared to other selection methods,

among which FPE (Luetkepohl 1985). Since we are interested in robust estimates,

we have generally adopted the SBC.

We then perform a Montecarlo experiment by running several times the autore-

gressive system having the previously obtained optimal parameters and compute

the statistics of the outputs.

In such simulations, the initial conditions are es-

sentially not relevant in statistical terms. Anyway, in order to eliminate transient

effects and consider statistical equilibrium conditions, granted by the stationarity

of the process, we do not consider the ﬁrst 1000 time steps.

This approach allows us to obtain an estimate of the standard deviation of

the trend. This analysis gives in all cases a negative result, i.e. we obtain non

statistically-signiﬁcant trends. The 95% conﬁdence intervals consistent with the

null trend hypothesis are shown in tables 1 and 2 for the amplitude and phase

functions, respectively.

14

6. Notes on the de-seasonalized data

In ﬁgures 6 we present the data sets obtained by subtracting the computed seasonal

cycles to the corresponding temperature records. These data have been ﬁtted with

autoregressive models, whose order and parameters have also been estimated with

suitable software (Neumaier and Schneider 2001; Schneider and Neumaier 2001).

The main statistical properties of these data are presented in table 3. In all cases

the estimated optimal value of the autoregressive order, where the SBC has been

adopted, is between 3 and 5, which closely resembles the characteristic time scale

of the mid-latitude cyclones. The variability of the subtracted signal, which can

be estimated by the value of the corresponding standard deviation, is larger for the

variables referring to station N, and largest for T N

max. This might be related to the

fact that mid-latitudes baroclinic weather disturbances are stronger in Northern

Italy, while the Southern Italy climate is less inﬂuenced by such meteorological

features. The climate of Southern Italy might depend more on the strength and

position of the Hadley cell, which has a less pronounced short-time variability.

Comparing the last two columns of table 3, we see that in all cases the vari-

ance of the de-seasonalized signal is smaller by about 5% than the signal obtained

by erasing the 1y−1 frequency component computed over all the spectrum. This

implies that the local estimate of the seasonal cycle can explain a larger fraction

of the total variance of the signal than the rigorously periodic seasonal signal ob-

tained with DFT.

We underline that a correct evaluation of the seasonal signal is of outstanding

15

importance for a correct approach to the problem of determining the extremes of a

given climate record. In the case of the data sets under investigation in this work, a

thorough analysis of the extremes will be shortly presented in a future publication.

7. Conclusions

In this work we have analyzed the data sets covering the last 50 years of daily

maximum and minimum temperature which are representative of the Northern

and of the Southern Italy temperature ﬁelds, respectively.

We have analyzed the seasonal cycle with the technique of cyclograms, which

allows to ﬁnd at each time the quasi-instantaneous best estimate of the annual

component of the record. The resulting seasonal signal is not strictly periodic,

since at each time the estimates of phase and amplitude change slightly.

It is important to underline that such an approach is viable because our signal

obeys the narrow band approximation, i.e. the spectrum of the signal has a strong,

narrow peak for the annual cyclic component. If, on the contrary, the signal is

characterized by a broad spectral feature comprising the 1y−1 frequency compo-

nent, it is a mathematical nonsense to investigate whether the seasonal cycle is

changing. In such a case the seasonal cycle is just not deﬁned, because several

contiguous spectral components having different frequencies and shifting phase

differences give contributions of comparable importance.

In all cases analyzed, the time-dependent estimates of amplitude and phase of

the seasonal cycles do not show any statistically signiﬁcant trend in the time frame

16

considered. Moreover, in each case the average value of the estimates closely re-

semble the amplitude and phase of the 1 year frequency sinusoidal signal resulting

from the Fourier analysis of the whole data set. Succinctly, seasons seem to have

not changed in their annual evolution.

In general, the amplitude of the maximum temperature seasonal cycle is larger

than that of the minimum temperature, and seasonal cycles of station N are larger

than those of station S. In terms of phase, we observe that in general the minimum

temperature seasonal cycle lags behind the maximum temperature seasonal cycle,

and that the seasonal cycles of the station S lag behind the corresponding cycles

of the station N. All seasonal cycles lag considerably behind the solar cycle.

On one side, thermal inertia effects related to the day/night cycle explain the

lag and different amplitudes of the cycles of maximum and minimum tempera-

tures. On the other side, larger scale thermal inertia effects related to the different

thermal properties of sea and land provide a qualitative argument for the differ-

ences in amplitude and phase of the station N and S cycles. We underline that

Northern Italy is more continental than Southern Italy. The data support that two

effects, which we have physically referred to the the North-South and maximum-

minimum (or day-night) asymmetries, sum up linearly both for phase and ampli-

tude of the seasonal signals.

The data obtained by subtracting from the signal the corresponding seasonal

cycle have been ﬁtted as autoregressive systems, whose order and parameters have

also been estimated with suitable software. In all cases the optimal value of the

autoregressive order is between 3 and 5 (which is expressed in term of days) which

17

closely resembles the characteristic time scale of the mid-latitude cyclones. The

variability of the subtracted signal, which can be estimated by the value of the

corresponding standard deviation, is larger for the northern variables, and largest

for T N

max.

This might suggest that the climate of Northern Italy is strongly driven, in sta-

tistical sense, by the southern portions of the storm-track Atlantic eddies, while we

might guess that the northernmost branch of the Hadley cell plays a very relevant

role for the climate of Southern Italy. In future work it would be possible to test

such hypothesis by correlating the seasonal signal of the temperature records here

analyzed with the seasonal signal of suitably deﬁned indicators of storm-track

activity and meridional circulation.

Finally, we wish to emphasize two major limitations of the present work with

the perspective of providing hints for future research. We wish to underline that

if on one side the surface temperature is a very relevant quantity in terms of inﬂu-

ence on the biosphere, including human activities, on the other side it is not the

most relevant quantity in terms of representing schematically the thermodynamic

properties of the system. As well known, a measure of the average tropospheric

temperature is much more relevant in this sense (Peixoto and Oort 1992). There-

fore, a more physically sensitive approach would be considering the records of

the whole vertical temperature proﬁle. Obviously, this requires the availability of

long and reliable radiosonde records.

Moreover, it is important to note that, when considering a limited area, the

direct solar forcing is not the only relevant forcing, since air advection at all levels

18

from nearby areas plays a fundamental role in determining the state of the system

under consideration. This is of special signiﬁcance for areas, such the Mediter-

ranean basin or a fortiori Italy, which do not have a strong endogeneous climate

mode, as occurs in the case of the Indian Monsoon area or Siberia, and are char-

acterized by an essentially residual climate.

Therefore, it would be important to consider in future analyses the estimates

of the convergence of thermal ﬂuxes obtained from the available reanalyses. It

is important to note that especially in the case of relatively small and elongated

territories such as Italy, the resolution of the data becomes of critical relevance.

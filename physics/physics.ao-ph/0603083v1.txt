(Dated: Revision : 1.101, compiled February 2, 2008)

We study the dynamics of the El Ni˜no phenomenon using the mathematical model of delayed-
action oscillator (DAO). Topics such as the inﬂuence of the annual cycle, global warming, stochastic
inﬂuences due to weather conditions and even oﬀ-equatorial heat-sinks can all be discussed using only
modest analytical and numerical resources. Thus the DAO allows for a pedagogical introduction
to the science of El Ni˜no and La Ni˜na while at the same time avoiding the need for large-scale
computing resources normally associated with much more sophisticated coupled atmosphere-ocean
general circulation models. It is an approach which is ideally suited for student projects both at
high school and undergraduate level.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Where weather is concerned, attempts at its predic-
tion [1, 2] and its apparent unpredictability have al-
ways intrigued the human mind. Related phenomena
such as storms, ﬂoods and droughts, as well as global
weather and issues of climate prediction such as the
green-house-gas eﬀect and global warming regularly ap-
pear in news bulletins and TV programs worldwide [3, 4].
Thus weather is where many of us get our ﬁrst expo-
sure to science and in particular science’s attempts at
predicting natural behavior of highly complex systems.
However, precisely because of this complexity, inexperi-
enced science enthusiasts rarely have the tools needed to
engage in predicting atmospheric behavior.

One particular example of a natural atmospheric phe-
nomenon which continues to attract regular public at-
tention is the so-called El Ni˜no event in the equato-
rial Paciﬁc, which occurs irregularly at intervals of 2–7
years with occasionally dramatic consequences for many
regions worldwide. These “teleconnections” can be ob-
served in many places, for example spring rainfall levels
in Central Europe, ﬂooding in East Africa, and the fe-
rocity of the hurricane season in the Gulf of Mexico [5].
Predictions of when and where El Ni˜no weather patterns
will dominate local weather conditions are very hard to
obtain. Usually, so-called coupled atmosphere-ocean gen-
eral circulation models (CGCMs), combined with large
scale computing resources are needed to study and pre-
dict El Ni˜no’s consequences [6, 7]. Clearly, such resources
will normally be beyond the reach of teachers and even
lecturers at university. Consequently, student projects
on the El Ni˜no phenomenon which involve a substantial
quantitative component are rare.

Fortunately, a route towards qualitative and quan-
titative prediction exists. This approach is based on
the delayed-action oscillator (DAO), a one-dimensional,
non-linear ordinary diﬀerential equation with delay term
which was introduced in 1988 by Suarez and Schopf [8].
The DAO models the irregular ﬂuctuations of the sea-
surface temperature (SST), incorporating the full cou-

pled Navier-Stokes dynamics of the El Ni˜no event via a
suitably chosen non-linearity. While previous studies of
the model have concentrated on the universal properties
of the dimensionless dynamics [8, 9], we shall show in the
present paper how to use the DAO to predict many of the
essential features of El Ni˜no events. We shall extend the
model to quantitatively include the eﬀects of the annual
cycle, global warming, randomness in temperature condi-
tions and the possible inﬂuence of the dynamics outside
the equator. We believe that this discussion of the DAO
opens up various avenues for student projects, be it at
the high school or undergraduate level. Important un-
derlying physics and meteorology concepts such as ocean
waves and their speeds, non-linear dynamics, the Corio-
lis force, convective cycles of ocean and atmosphere cur-
rents, global wind patterns and their stability can be dis-
cussed and help the students understand that El Ni˜no —
far from only being a bringer of doom as sometimes por-
trayed in the media — is in fact a natural consequence
of our planet’s celestial dynamics [10].

The paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we re-
view the El Ni˜no-Southern Oscillation phenomenon. Sec-
tion III introduces the basic DAO model and we study
its basic dynamics. Sections IV, V and VI investigate the
inﬂuences of annual forcing, global warming and random
eﬀects on the DAO, with Section VII incorporating all
these processes. Section VIII then extends that single
DAO to more than one coupled DAO. We conclude in
Section IX. Information on the numerical methods and
an example code can be found in the appendix.

II. ENSO PHENOMENOLOGY

The term El Ni˜no was originally used, from as early
as the late 19th century [11], in reference to an observed
warm southward ﬂowing current that moderates the low
SST along the west coast of Peru and Ecuador [12, 13].
This current arrives after Christmas, during the early
months of the calendar year, and was therefore named
“El Ni˜no” (The “Little Boy” or Christ Child in Spanish).

In certain years this current would be unusually strong,
bringing heavy rains and ﬂooding inland, but also deci-
mating ﬁshing stocks, bird populations and other water-
based wildlife in what would normally be an abundant
part of the Paciﬁc.

Today, the term El Ni˜no is most often used when de-
scribing a far larger-scale warm event that can be ob-
served across the whole of the Paciﬁc Ocean by cer-
tain characteristic climatic conditions. El Ni˜no is just
one phase of the so-called El Ni˜no-Southern Oscillation
(ENSO) phenomenon, i.e. an irregular cycle of coupled
ocean temperature and atmospheric pressure oscillations
across the whole equatorial Paciﬁc. In Fig. 1, we show
the measured SST as well as the average annual cycle.

are denoted by a black square above the event, La Ni˜na events
(see section II C) by a black circle below.

Since 1899, there have been 29 recorded El Ni˜no events,
giving an average period for ENSO of 3.7 years [14]. How-
ever, there is evidence to suggest that El Ni˜no events are
becoming stronger and more frequent; there have been 6
events in the last 20 yrs (an average period of 3.3 years),
2 of which were the strongest of the century [12, 14].

FIG. 2: Schematic view of the Ni˜no regions 3 (right hashed
rectangle), 4 (left hashed rectangle) and 3.4 (rectangle with
dashed line borders). The thermocline height in normal
(solid) and El Ni˜no conditions (dashed line) is indicated
schematically in the diagram.

The SST is about 8◦C higher in the West, with cool tem-
peratures oﬀ South America, due to cold water upwelling,
i.e. rising from the deeper layer to the surface [15]. This
cold nutrient-rich water supports diverse marine ecosys-
tems and major ﬁsheries, so upwelling is of immense eco-
logical and economic importance to the west coast of the
Americas [12, 13].

The warmer SST in the West means increased evapora-
tion and rising moist air, and hence high levels of rainfall
(a tropical climate), along with low atmospheric sea-level
pressures in the West. In the East, the colder SST re-
sults in far less rainfall, an arid inland climate and higher
atmospheric sea-level pressures. This induced pressure
diﬀerence drives the circulation of the trade winds. A
measure of the strength of the trade winds is the South-
ern Oscillation Index (SOI), deﬁned as the normalized
diﬀerence in sea-level pressures between Tahiti and Dar-
win, Australia.

The whole process is a therefore a self-sustaining cycle;
winds cause thermocline and SST changes, which cause
pressure diﬀerences, which in turn drive the winds.

A. Normal conditions

B. El Ni˜no conditions

In order to understand the El Ni˜no anomaly, let us
ﬁrst describe the normal conditions that exist in the Pa-
ciﬁc Ocean between 120◦ East and 90◦ West. In Fig. 2
we show a schematic view of the relevant section of the
Paciﬁc.

In normal conditions, the trade winds blow from East
to West across the tropical Paciﬁc, resulting in warm sur-
face water being pushed west, so that the thermocline —
a region of water roughly 100m below the surface where
there is a very sharp temperature gradient separating the
warm surface layer from the cold abyss — is depressed
further in the West, and made shallower in the East [11].

During an El Ni˜no event the SST and SOI change dra-
matically.
In the central and western Paciﬁc, there is
relaxation in the strength of the trade winds. This leads
to a depression of the thermocline in the East and an
elevation in the West, because less warm water is be-
ing pushed west. This increase in thermocline depth in
the East can be as large as a factor of three, leading to
an increase in SST, and the eﬀective cut-oﬀ of upwelling
of nutrients to the surface. This has devastating conse-
quences for the primary producers (such as plankton) in
the food chain, with knock-on eﬀects for other life, such
as ﬁsh and birdlife [11].

The increased SST in the East also leads to an in-
creased evaporation, and large amounts of rain, often
causing extensive ﬂooding. The rising air decreases the
normally high pressure. During large El Ni˜no events the
SOI is very negative, indicating a reversal in trade winds.
This causes a great deal of warm, moist air (and hence
rain) to move east, whilst leaving a severe drought in the
western Paciﬁc, often resulting in large bush ﬁres.

C. La Ni˜na conditions

La Ni˜na (The “Little Girl”) is the phase of the ENSO
cycle which is opposite to El Ni˜no.
It is characterized
by unusually cold ocean temperatures in the central and
eastern Paciﬁc. La Ni˜na arises by a strengthening in the
trade winds, further depressing the thermocline in the
West (and elevating it in the East), which increases cold
water upwelling in the eastern Paciﬁc. This lower SST
means the high levels of nutrients can support an abun-
dance of life in the Ocean. The SOI is also positive (in-
creased pressure diﬀerence), bringing enhanced rainfall
in the West.

III. THE DELAYED-ACTION OSCILLATOR

A. A non-linear oscillator with delay term

The DAO is a simple non-linear model in which the
ENSO eﬀect is modeled by just three terms [8]. With
T denoting the temperature anomaly, i.e. the deviation
from a suitably deﬁned long term average temperature,
the model is given as a ﬁrst-order, non-linear diﬀerential
equation

dT
dt

= kT

−

− A

−

with appropriate coupling constants k, b,
and ∆. The
ﬁrst term on the right hand side in (1) represents a strong
positive feedback within a coupled ocean-atmosphere sys-
tem which is assumed to occur in the Ni˜no 3.4 region. A
much deeper thermocline as in the West, or a cold SST
as in the East, would result in much poorer feedback
coupling. The feedback process works through advective
processes giving rise to temperature perturbations which
in turn result in atmospheric heating. This heating leads
to surface winds, driving the ocean currents which will
then enhance the anomaly T .

The second component is an unspeciﬁed nonlinear net
damping term that is present in order to limit the growth
of unstable perturbations. This term represents various
ocean advective processes and moist processes that stop
temperatures diverging.

Lastly, the model also considers equatorially-trapped
ocean waves propagating across the Paciﬁc, before inter-
acting back with the central Paciﬁc region after a cer-
tain time delay. These ocean waves are “hidden” Rossby

3

waves which move westward on the thermocline, reﬂect
oﬀ the rigid continental boundary in the West and then
return eastward along the equator as Kelvin waves. Their
respective wave velocities and the width of the Paciﬁc
basin determine the transit time, which is denoted ∆ in
Eq. (1). The strength of the returning, emerging signals
relative to that of the local non-delayed feedback is de-
noted by
< k due to loss
of information during transit and imperfect reﬂection.

the prime in all expressions where there is no ambiguity.

B. DAO wave propagation

The DAO delay term has a negative coeﬃcient rep-
resenting a negative feedback. To see the reason for
this, let us consider a warm SST perturbation in the
coupled region. This produces a westerly wind response
that deepens the thermocline locally (immediate positive
feedback), but at the same time, the wind perturbations
produce divergent westward propagating Rossby waves
that return after time ∆ to create upwelling and cool-
ing, reducing the original perturbation. This process can
therefore be seen as a phase-reversing reﬂection oﬀ the
coupled region; the resultant upwelling will cause further
Rossby wave propagation, which in turn will cause down-
welling and warming after a further delay, ∆. Hence we
expect the period of model oscillations to be no less that
2∆ — “period doubling” [8].

Note that the eastern boundary will also contribute a
delay term to the DAO, however equatorial Kelvin wave
reﬂection from eastern boundaries is weak as the bulk of
the wave propagates along the coast [16]. For this reason
we may ignore these eﬀects.

It is possible to estimate the wave transit times, and
hence the time delay ∆ of the DAO model, from knowl-
edge of the wave speeds for Rossby and Kelvin waves
(see Appendix A). We shall return to this direct com-
parison later, but for now we focus on the behavior of
the dimensionless DAO (2).

C. Linear stability analysis

Equation (2) cannot be solved analytically. But we
may study its dynamics by analyzing its behavior close
the its ﬁxed points, i.e. those special solutions ¯T of (2) for
which dT /dt = 0 which also immediately implies T (t) =
T (t

δ) for all t. Hence we need to solve

and so the ﬁxed point solutions are ¯T = 0,
α.
¯T0 = 0 is the trivial ﬁxed point, corresponding to a
zero temperature anomaly. It is also unstable, i.e. any
small perturbation will lead to a system moving away
from 0. Therefore we shall concentrate on the other two
ﬁxed points ¯T± =
α. Due to symmetry, it is fur-
thermore suﬃcient to consider one of these only and we
choose ¯T+ = √1

The dynamics close to ¯T+ can be examined by a linear
stability analysis. Let us consider a small perturbation
¯T+. Ignoring terms of more than linear order in

In Figure 3, we show the (α, δ) phase diagram of the
DAO obtained from the linear stability analysis. Only
0.5 < α < 1 is plotted, since for this domain the coeﬃ-
cient on the local term in (4) is always smaller than that
of the delayed term. If it were larger, then the local term
would always dominate, and the solution would always
be stable, i.e. for α < 0.5 the ﬁxed point is always stable
and attracting, regardless of the initial conditions.

Choosing (α, δ) below the ﬁrst neutral curve, e.g.
within the shaded region of Figure 3, corresponds to
σR < 0 and hence the solution is a decaying spiral —
the ﬁxed point is stable and attractive. However, tak-
ing (α, δ) above this neutral curve gives σR > 0, and so
the perturbation spiral grows outwards — the ﬁxed point
is unstable and no matter how close to T0 the solution
starts, it will always move away.

If (α, δ) is taken above the second neutral curve, the
ﬁxed point is still unstable (σR > 0) but the number of
unstable modes has increased to two. However, the basic
DAO equation (2) is only a one-dimensional problem, as
there is only one variable T , and so the extra unstable
modes do not inﬂuence the dynamics.

This linear stability approach is highly useful, given
that it depends on only two parameters, α and δ, and
reveals valuable information about the stabilities of the
ﬁxed points. Given an α and a δ, it also provides a
solution to the DAO given by:

T (t) = ¯T+ + AeσRteıσIt

which is perfectly valid to within an order of
vided it stays close to ¯T+. However, once a solution is too
far from an unstable ﬁxed point or if the initial condition
starts too far away from the ﬁxed point, this linear stabil-
ity approach breaks down. Figure 4 shows linear stability
solutions for diﬀerent δ values, given by Eq. (8), along
with the full solutions discussed in Section III D.

D. Computation of full solutions by numerical
integration

Let us now construct solutions to the DAO which are
outside the region of validity of the linear stability anal-
ysis. As mentioned before, this is no longer possible
analytically, so we will use numerical techniques to in-
tegrate up the time-behavior of (2). Fortunately, this
involves the use of standard numerical tools available in
a variety of mathematical software packages. For con-
venience, we have chosen the predeﬁned Mathematica
package NDelayDSolve [17]. The Mathematica code used
to solve the basic DAO equation (2) is part of the code
shown in Appendix B.

In Figure 4, we show the results obtained from Eq. (2)
when carrying out this numerical procedure for α = 0.75
and various values of δ. The initial value used is T (0) =
0.55 which is close to the ﬁxed point ¯T+ = 0.5. In Fig.
5, we show the (T, dT /dt) phase portraits for two values
of δ close to the ﬁrst neutral curve.

Let us now brieﬂy discuss the observed behavior. In
Fig. 4(a), we see that the numerical solution and the

clearly breaks down very quickly, since the linear stability
analysis shows an unstable spiral, which continues to only
grow about ¯T+.

At an even larger δ value, we see in Fig. 4(c) that the
numerical solution immediately diverges from the ﬁxed
point and goes to an oscillatory state, the amplitude of
which is limited by the nonlinear damping term in Eq.
(2).

The behavior for other values of α is analogous. There-
fore, we have identiﬁed within the DAO model (2) a
whole region of α and δ values where we obtain oscil-
lations of the SST anomaly between a hot ( ¯T+ > 0) and
a cold ( ¯T− < 0) ﬁxed point. This feature is what makes
the DAO a model for oscillations between hot El Ni˜no
and cold La Ni˜na conditions.

E. Comparing periodicities

As identiﬁed in the last section, the DAO model is
capable of producing limit cycle oscillations for a wide
region of (α, δ) values. We next compute the period of
these oscillations and compare them to those observed
for typical ENSO cycles.

linear approximation are in good agreement and quickly
converge to the stable ﬁxed point ¯T+ = 0.5 as expected
for δ = 1. In Fig. 4(b), we are still close to the neutral
curve but have already crossed over into the unstable
regime. Consequently, the numerical solution starts to
slowly spiral away from ¯T+ = 0.5, becoming large enough
so that the dynamics are also inﬂuenced by the second
unstable ﬁxed point at ¯T− =
0.5, resulting in the onset
of oscillations between them. This is shown in more detail
in Fig. 5(b). The agreement with the numerical solution

As shown in Figure 2, the Ni˜no 3.4 region extends
from 120◦ West to 170◦ West, with the midpoint at 145◦
West. If we assume that the Paciﬁc western boundary is
120◦ East, this gives an angular separation of 95◦
at
of longitude for the waves to travel. This corresponds to
106m, where the
a distance of 95(2π/360)rEarth = 10.6
106m. Using the val-
radius of the Earth rEarth = 6.37
ues of 1.4ms−1 for a Kelvin wave and 0.47ms−1 for the
primary Rossby mode as obtained in Appendix A thus
gives a delay of 262 days for the Rossby propagation to
the western boundary, and a further 87 days for the re-
turn of the Kelvin waves, a total delay of ∆ = 349 days.
This information now allows us to compute the time
scaling parameter, however since k = δ/∆, these are dif-
ferent for each value of δ used in the DAO model. By the
use of a Fourier Transform applied over 600 years, we
ﬁnd e.g. for α = 0.7, δ = 3 a period τ ′ = 11.1 which cor-
responds to a true DAO period of τ = τ ′/k = 3.5 years.
In Fig. 6 we show the results of many runs with varying
α = 0.56, 0.57, . . . , 1 and δ = 1, 1.1, . . . , 4.9. Comparing

(α, δ) values where there is a good agreement.

F. Discussion of the basic DAO model

In the preceding sections, we have seen that the DAO
is a useful tool in studying the ENSO cycle. The main
beauty of the DAO (1) is its simplicity. Although the
full equation cannot be solved explicitly, the linear stabil-
ity analysis and the numerical solutions both give highly
useful insights. In particular, the numerical solutions ex-
hibit the true global dynamics of the DAO. There are

6

limit cycle oscillations, with a period that matches the
real world, and hence the DAO is a good model for these
features of ENSO. Nevertheless, the DAO model assumes
a localized coupled problem, which is obviously an over-
simpliﬁcation of the situation in the Paciﬁc. All inﬂu-
ences of the atmosphere, the earth’s rotation, and the
ocean currents and dynamics are simply modeled by a
non-linear, eﬀective damping term and a somewhat ar-
bitrary delay. The delay term ignores, e.g. East bound-
ary reﬂections that could possibly be considered. The
model further assumes that time scales must be related to
propagation times of equatorially trapped oceanic waves
in a closed basin. For the atmosphere, which has short
time scales, the DAO simply assumes an instantaneous
response.

IV. ANNUAL FORCING

In this and the following sections, we shall extend the
basic DAO discussed above by including external inﬂu-
ences which allow us to model the ENSO dynamics bet-
ter. In order to distinguish this extended DAO from its
original, we shall denote the new model as ENSO-DAO
from now on.

A. Modifying the DAO to include the annual cycle

As mentioned above, an El Ni˜no event typically ap-
pears in late December, early January. Thus the annual
cycle is clearly playing an important role in determining
the onset of El Ni˜no [18, 19]. Let us thus add to the
DAO (1) another term that models the periodic heat-
ing and cooling of the equator during the annual cycle.
The average SST data, as shown on Fig. 1, can be used
to construct a Mathematica interpolating function, Y (t),
representing the continuous changes of the average SST
during the year [27]. We therefore include its numerical
time derivative, representing the expected change in SST
due to annual forcing, to give a new DAO equation

This equation now depends critically on the (α, δ) values
chosen in the dimensionless model, since computation of
the scaling constants k and b is required. We have seen
earlier that k = δ/∆, and b is given by the expression
b = k(T ′/T )2. In order to estimate b we shall take T ′/T
as the ratio of their respective maxima/minima. Figure
1 shows the maximum anomaly is on average 2◦C, whilst
the maximum value of T ′ can be calculated for any values
(α, δ).

Choosing α = 0.7, δ = 3 as the standard ENSO-DAO
model for the next few sections allows us to calculate
k = 3.14/years, b = 1.09 ◦C−2/years, and hence discuss
the behavior of this speciﬁc model under annual forcing.

t = 0 to be the start of the year, the expected SST will
be at its coldest and dY /dt = 0, so we can take the initial
condition to be T (0) =

to before but now includes the scaling constants).

On its own, this term would give dT

β > 0, a constant heating, although β < 0 cooling can
be treated completely analogously.

Current climate change models predict the rise in av-
erage global temperature over the next 100 years will be
below 5◦C [20], hence we chose this scenario to be used
in our ENSO-DAO. Using the standard model of Section
IV, this gives

The ﬁxed point solutions are now determined by the

equation:

note that with the inclusion of annual forcing, T is no
longer the SST anomaly, but rather, the anomaly is the
diﬀerence between T and the annual forcing, Y (t). This
true SST anomaly is also shown in Fig. 7, and should be
compared to Fig. 1.

From Fig. 7 it is clear that the addition of an annual
forcing term has changed the dynamics in several ways.
Firstly, the peak amplitude of the oscillations has been
increased. The peaks themselves are less regular because
of the quickly changing forcing term provided by the sea-
sons. However, the paramount eﬀect of the annual cycle
is in determining the onset and period of an El Ni˜no
event. Hot events only occur in-phase with the annual
cycle, and hence the ENSO-DAO now has an exact inte-
ger period, e.g. 3 years for our model. The ENSO-DAO
gives high temperatures from July through to March of
the next year — which is indeed as observed in the Paciﬁc
— with the maximum amplitude usually in December.

V. GLOBAL WARMING

Global warming is another eﬀect that may inﬂuence
the periodicity and amplitude of ENSO events. For the
purpose of this paper it will be modeled via a constant

(cid:17)

(cid:16)
For small β, there is hardly any change from the original
¯T ﬁxed points, and hence the system will behave as the
basic DAO. As β is increased, the unstable inner ﬁxed
point ¯T (β)
decreases from zero, whereas both the outer
0
solutions ¯T (β)
± increase. In cases when β is large, and for
large enough α, only one ﬁxed point remains on the real
axis (the other two are now complex).

Consider a basic DAO system (above the solid black

point ¯T (β=0)
with limit cycle oscillations. By introduc-
ing β > 0, the neutral curve is shifted to the right, and
hence the additional (hashed) stable region in Fig. 8 is
created, changing the DAO dynamics. As β increases,

region aﬀected by global warming (hashed), and by coupling

the model ﬂuctuates for longer about the unstable ¯T (β)
+
before ﬂipping out to oscillate around both ﬁxed points.
Eventually, the dashed neutral curve in Fig. 8 moves to
the right of (α, δ) and ¯T (β)
+ becomes attracting. This sta-
bility bifurcation occurs at βbif , which can be found for
any given (α, δ) by solving Eq. (13) for β.

If enough heating were applied to the DAO, the ENSO
cycle would be terminated, leaving an ocean at a con-
stant temperature and with no El Ni˜no events. However,
for slow heating, such as β = 0.009, there is very little
change to the time dependence of the DAO with respect
to SST anomaly amplitudes or their periodicity except
for a small subset of solutions. This would suggest that
global warming will not aﬀect ENSO, and hence El Ni˜no
events will still continue to occur.

VI. STOCHASTIC EFFECTS

Chaos inherent in real world weather systems plays an
important part in the irregularity of El Ni˜no events. Pro-
cesses such as storms, cyclones and ocean currents which
traverse the Paciﬁc play no part in our ENSO model, but
will inﬂuence the system for their duration in the Ni˜no
3.4 region. We therefore consider the addition of a gen-
eral stochastic term [21] R(t) to the dimensional DAO
equation (1) giving:

dT
dt

= kT

bT 3

T (t

∆) + R(t)

(14)

−

− A

−

R(t) is a step function that takes ﬁxed, normally dis-
tributed (mean 0, standard deviation λ), random val-
ues for each monthly time-step. A (non-ENSO) event
that lasts for longer than one month is unphysical, and
shorter-lived events will not have time to cause any sig-
niﬁcant diﬀerences (their randomness is averaged out).

8

Another way of viewing R(t) is as a β heating/cooling
that only lasts for one month. This will mean that the
neutral curves given by Eq. (13) will shift right/left each
month, due to the ﬁxed points ¯T (R)

± changing position.

If λ is small, then there is hardly any change to the ba-
sic DAO. However, for large enough λ, the ﬁxed points
can change their stabilities each month, inducing a great
deal of random behavior in the DAO. For example, the
system may be stable and tending towards ¯T (R)
+ of that
month, and then R(t) changes to produce an unstable
system that wants to oscillate. This creates many diﬀer-
ent El Ni˜no events with diﬀering amplitudes and dura-
tions, as well as the possibility of times where the system
stays near zero.

VII. THE FULL ENSO-DAO

We now combine of all of the eﬀects considered above,
namely the annual cycle, global warming and stochastic
eﬀects. Therefore the DAO equation (1) becomes

istic pictures, such as Fig. 9, that look remarkably sim-
ilar to Fig. 1. Most obvious are the small ﬂuctuations

In addition, the
regularity of the original DAO oscillations is broken and
sometimes a complete ENSO event has vanished. E.g.
the absence of the SST peaks at about t
20 in Fig. 9.
This happens when the onset of the ENSO cycle event
takes place at a time when the random forcing happens
to change the SST into the opposite direction. We em-
phasize that a variety of solution curves similar to Fig.

VIII. COUPLED DAOS

The basic DAO model (1) considers a single, but repre-
sentative region with strong atmospheric-ocean coupling
in the Paciﬁc. Clearly, we might also want to consider
situations in which other regions of the Paciﬁc are in-
corporated. These could be either other regions along
the equator, where we would expect diﬀering coupling
strengths and delay times. Or they could be regions to
the North and South of the central DAO region in which
no delay and only weak coupling exists, such that these
additional regions act as temperature sinks. Possible ar-
rangements are shown in Fig. 10.
In this chapter, we
will consider one such prototype situation, namely two
coupled regions along the equator.

DAO region (grey), new coupled regions 1 and 2 and potential
North–South regions (hashed). The equator is indicated as a
horizontal dashed line.

A. Two coupled DAOs along the equator

Let us for simplicity assume that coupling α and de-
lay δ in the two regions are the same. This is a valid
assumption as long as the two adjacent regions are both
in the strong-coupling region such that the distance to
the Western boundary is approximately the same, with
the same losses and reﬂection properties. If one region
is warmer than the other, then the ﬂow of heat energy
across their common boundary will act to heat one and
cool the other. This can be modeled by incorporating
a γTi+1 term in each DAO with γ > 0 and Ti+1 the
anomaly in the adjacent DAO region. Then we have a
system of 2 coupled DAOs such that

The ﬁxed point solutions can be found as before by

yields a 9th order polynomial in ¯T (γ)
i with a mixture of
real and complex roots which vary as a function of γ.
The solutions ¯T (γ)

regions and are always real since 0 < α < 1, and hence
are of most interest.

The ﬁrst neutral curve is shown in Figure 8 for an exam-
ple with γ = 0.2.

We see that similar to Section V, the neutral curves
move right with increasing γ, such that the ﬁxed point
can bifurcate from unstable to stable. So, if there is
strong coupling between regions in the Paciﬁc (large
γ), then independent oscillations cannot occur and the
system settles down to constant temperature anomalies.
However, for suﬃciently weak coupling, ENSO-style os-
cillations are still permitted.

As before, we have also solved the Eq. (16) numerically.
Depending on the initial SST anomalies, we ﬁnd that we
can drive the regions into (i) stable, non-oscillatory solu-
tions, (ii) in-phase oscillations and even (iii) oscillations
which are out-of-phase by π. For brevity, we do not show
the results here.

B. Two regions with diﬀerent ENSO coupling

Let us now consider brieﬂy the situation in which αi or
δi are diﬀerent in the diﬀerent regions. If T2 represents
the anomaly in region 2 of Fig. 10 and T1 the anomaly
in region 1, then the wave transit time from T1 to the
western boundary would be greater than that from T2.
Similarly, the strength of the returning signal to T1 would
be less than that to T2, as more information would be lost
due to the greater distance across which information is
transported. However, the waves propagating from T1
are not hidden from the problem whilst they are propa-
gating through T2, suggesting that δ could be the same
for both regions, namely the propagation time from T2 to
the western boundary and back. Similarly, the strength
of the local coupling is assumed to be less in T1, suggest-
ing that even though the strength of the returning signal
is less, relative to the local coupling its aﬀect would be the
same as in T2. Figure 11 shows how the coupled model
(16) is aﬀected by diﬀerent values of α. In the Figure we
see that T1 shows some irregular behavior with varying
amplitudes. This behavior is more like that of El Ni˜no
than the simple DAO.

Other possible coupled DAO scenarios could include 3
coupled regions, either along the equator or aligned along

a south-north axis. Our preliminary results indicate that
such models gives rise to irregular ENSO cycles as above.
However, the models have to be treated with proper care,
since some solutions become unphysical, e.g. indicating
uninterrupted heating or cooling of the ocean.

IX. CONCLUSIONS

The DAO is given by a simple one-dimensional diﬀer-
ential equation, and may nowadays be studied by readily
available desk- or laptop computing facilities. Yet it cap-
tures much of the observed richness and variance of the
ENSO phenomenon. We are therefore convinced that it
presents an ideal tool to introduce students to the topic.
Let us brieﬂy recapitulate what issues we have been able
to study in the present paper using the DAO. We ﬁrst
outline the linear stability analysis and the numerical so-
lution of the DAO that were the content of the ﬁrst paper
on the DAO [8]. This then serves to introduce the con-
cept of shallow-water Kelvin and Rossby waves, as well as
to establish our notation. Using the corresponding wave
speeds and the geography of the Paciﬁc, we can already
show that for a large set of parameters, the observed
ENSO periodicity can be modeled by the DAO.

Next, the inclusion of the measured annual cycle
demonstrates that the observed ENSO-DAO periodicity
may in fact be heavily inﬂuenced by the Earth’s period
around the Sun. The occurrence of an ENSO event is
very much subject to the right season and thus the orig-
inal DAO period need not be identical to the observed
ENSO-DAO period. We stress that the modeling of the
annual cycle within the DAO is quite easy and should
not be beyond any student who has mastered the origi-
nal DAO.

We then extended the DAO to include a constant heat-
ing — global warming — and found that current pre-
dictions of 5◦C rise over 100 years are unlikely to in-

10

ﬂuence the ENSO-DAO dynamics. We also do not ﬁnd
any large increase in either occurrence or magnitude of
ENSO events. This seems to be at variance with current
predictions based on CGCMs [22, 23] and might just in-
dicate the limitations of the ENSO-DAO model for true,
quantitative predictions [28].

Putting it all together, we then included a certain
level of stochastic forcing alongside the annual cycle, and
found that the ENSO-DAO dynamics now become very
much like the observed ENSO dynamics, showing a large
variation in oscillation periods and amplitudes. At least
on a qualitative level — the range of the SST oscillations
is in fact even quantitatively similar — which shows the
strength of the ENSO-DAO.

Finally, we brieﬂy discussed some extensions of the
ENSO-DAO model, such as coupled regions. The ex-
ample of the 2-coupled-regions model shows that the
extended DAOs share some irregularities with the ob-
served ENSO phenomenon already, even in the absence
of annual or stochastic forcing. Further investigations of
ENSO-DAO might include an analysis of the statistical
properties of the measured ENSO cycles as in Fig. 9 and
comparisons with observed data, a more thorough anal-
ysis of the possible changes in periodicity and strengths
of ENSO-DAO oscillations due to human inﬂuences, a
mathematical analysis of the DAO for integer periods or
even an application to the Atlantic.

In conclusion, we see that the DAO — while being a
research tool in its own right [9] — can be investigated
by modest analytical and computational resources. We
think that it will be an ideal topic for all students, teach-
ers and lecturers interested in the exciting dynamics of
the El Ni˜no phenomenon and hope that the present paper
will help them in this quest.

APPENDIX A: SHALLOW WATER EQUATIONS
AND WAVES

1. Two-ﬂuid model and shallow water equations

Oceans are warmer near the surface than they are in
the deep, and due to thermal expansion this warm layer
will have a lower density. Thus a simple model for the
ocean structure is a two-ﬂuid model with density ρ1 in
the warm surface layer and density ρ2 > ρ1 below in the
cold abyss. The dividing zone is called the thermocline.
At its widest, the Paciﬁc is 17, 700km across from the

Malay Peninsula to Panama whilst only having an aver-
age depth of 4, 280m. So the Paciﬁc is roughly 3 orders of
magnitude wider than it is deep, and so we are justiﬁed in
rewriting the original Navier-Stokes equations using the
shallow-water approximation [24, 25]. These are given as

η(x, y, t) is a small perturbation to the constant mean
thermocline depth H. Furthermore, f is the Coriolis pa-
rameter and g′ = ρ2−ρ1
g is the eﬀective gravitational ac-
celeration. Equations (A1) permit two types of thermo-
cline wave solutions. The ﬁrst are inertia-gravity Kelvin
waves. The second type are planetary Rossby waves.

In addition, Eq. (A2b) prohibits westward propagation
(F (x + ct)) since those solutions become unbounded at
large y. Therefore only eastward, equatorially trapped
(v = 0), Kelvin waves are possible. These non-dispersive
thermocline gravity waves propagate eastward with speed

3. Rossby waves

Rossby waves owe their existence to the variation of the
Coriolis parameter with latitude. Close to the equator
the Coriolis parameter is given by f = 2Ωy/rEarth where
rEarth is the radius of the Earth and Ω the Earth’s angular
velocity. If we consider a linearized version of the shallow-
water equations and seek solutions for latitudinal waves

and β = 2Ω/rEarth. From (A3) we see that solutions are
wavelike within an equatorial waveguide of width 2Y , and
decay exponentially for latitudes greater than

If we now assume that the latitudinal dependance of V
is of plane-wave type

with wavelength λ =
c/β. Since k must therefore be
negative, all Rossby waves have westward phase propa-
gation. The slow, short, dispersive waves have eastward
group velocities and the fast, long, non-dispersive waves
have westward group velocities of c/(2n + 1). Only the
long waves are important in the oceanic adjustment to
changes in surface winds — a process that is crucial in
ocean-atmosphere coupled systems — so only westward
propagating Rossby waves will usually be considered.

The fastest Rossby wave (n = 1) travels at one third

the speed of a Kelvin wave, e.g.
ciﬁc. These are the non-dispersive, equatorially trapped,
westward propagating Rossby waves considered in the
DAO model in Section III.

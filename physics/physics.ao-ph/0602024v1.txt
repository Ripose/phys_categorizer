Abstract

The system of hydrodynamic-type equations, derived by two-side distribution
function for a stratiﬁed gas in gravity ﬁeld is applied to a problem of ultrasound
propagation and attenuation. The background state and linearized version of the
obtained system is studied and compared with the Navier-Stokes one at arbitrary
Knudsen numbers. The WKB solutions for ultrasound in a stratiﬁed medium are
constructed in explicit form. The problem of a generation by a moving plane in a
rareﬁed gas is explored and used as a test while compared with experiment.

Introduction

Recently the problems of Kn regime wave propagation was revisited in connection with
general ﬂuid mechanics and nonsingular perturbation method development [1, 2, 3, 4]. A
generalized Boltzman theories [5, 6] also contributed in a progress with respect to this
important problem.

In [7] the propagation of one-dimension disturbance was studied on the base of the
method of a piecewise continuous distribution function launched in a pioneering paper of
Lees [8] and applied for a gas in gravity ﬁeld in [1, 9]. We derived hydrodynamic-type
equations for a gas perturbations in gravity ﬁeld so that the Knudsen number depends
on the (vertical) coordinate. The generalization to three dimensions is given at [12]

The derivation of the hydrodynamic-type equations is based on kinetic equation with
the model integral of collisions in BGK (Bhatnagar - Gross - Krook ) form which collision
f ) , via local-equilibrium distribution function fl and the
term is modelled as ν (fl

The increase of the number of parameters of distribution function results in that the
distribution function diﬀers from a local-equilibrium one and describes deviations from
hydrodynamical regime. In the range of small Knudsen numbers l << L we automatically
have n+ = n−, U + = U −, T + = T − and distribution function reproduces the hydrodynam-
ics of Euler and at the small diﬀerence of the functional ”up” and ”down” parameters
- the Navier-Stokes equations.
In the range of big Knudsen numbers the theory gives
solutions of collisionless problems [9].

We used a set of linearly independent eigen functions of the linearized Boltzmann

operator, that in the case of the BGK equation is:

The system (1) of the equations according to the derivation scheme is valid at all
frequencies of collisions and within the limits of the high frequencies should transform to
the hydrodynamic equations.

So we have closed the system (1), hence a modiﬁcation of the procedure for deriving
ﬂuid mechanics (hydrodynamic-type) equations from the kinetic theory is proposed, it
generalizes the Navier-Stokes at arbitrary density (Knudsen numbers).

Our method gives a reasonable agreement with the experimental data in the case of
homogeneous gas [7]. In the paper [7] the expressions for (J1,2) are obtained with account
some nonlinear terms, that ﬁnally lead to more exact results.

2 Stationary case (undisturbed atmosphere).

Let’s linearize the system (1) this way:

ρ = ρ0(z)(1 + ερ1(t, z)) ,

Uz = εUz1(t, z) ,

P (t, z) = P0(z)(1 + εP1(t, z)) , T = T0(z)(1 + εT1(t, z)) ,

qz = qz0(z)(1 + εqz1(t, z)) ,

¯qz = ¯qz0(z)(1 + ε¯qz1(t, z)) ,

ε << 1 .

Some version of such system that leads to a non-exponential density dependence on height
was studied in [9, 10], the paradox was discussed at [11].

Let’s solve the zero order system.

we’ll have exponential density dependence on height.

3 Construction of solutions of the ﬂuid dynamics sys-

tem by WKB method.

In this section we apply the method WKB to the system (10). We shall assume, that
on the bottom boundary at z = 0 a wave with characteristic frequency ω0 is generated.
Next we choose the frequency ω0 to be large enough, to put characteristic parameter

3ω0H

ξ =

1. We shall search for the solution in the form:

Mn = ψn exp(iω0t) + c.c. ,

ψ1 =

here ϕk(z) - the phase functions corresponding to diﬀerent roots of dispersion relation. For
other moments Mn , n = 2, . . . , 6 corresponding functions ψn are given by similar to (12)
expansion. The appropriate coeﬃcients of the series we shall designate by corresponding
B(k)
m . Substituting the series (12) at the system (10) one arrives at
algebraic equations for the coeﬃcients of (12) in each order. The condition of solutions

The dispersion relation (13) represents the cubic equation with variable coeﬃcients,
therefore the exact analytical solution by formula Cardano looks very bulky and inconve-

The solution of the equation (13) at any u is evaluated numerically. As an illustra-
tion let us consider a problem of generation and propagation of a gas disturbance, by a
plane oscillating with a given frequency ω0. We restrict ourselves by the case of homoge-
neous gas, because it is the only case of existing experimental realization. We evaluate
numerically the propagation velocity and attenuation factor of a linear sound.

4 Conclusion

In this paper we propose a one-dimensional theory of linear disturbances in a gas, stratiﬁed
in gravity ﬁeld, hence propagating through regions with crucially diﬀerent Kn numbers.
The regime of the propagation dramatically changes from a typically hydrodynamic to
the free-molecular one. We also studied three-dimensional case [12]. Generally the theory
is based on Gross-Jackson kinetic equation, which solution is built by means of locally
equilibrium distribution function with diﬀerent local parameters for molecules moving
”up” and ”down”. Equations for six moments yields in the closed ﬂuid mechanics system.
For the important generalizations of the foundation of such theory see the recent review
of Alexeev [5].

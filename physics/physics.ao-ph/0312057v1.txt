A simple model of irreversible aggregation under diﬀerential sedimentation of particles in a ﬂuid
is presented. The structure of the aggregates produced by this process is found to feed back on
the dynamics in such a way as to stabilise both the exponents controlling the growth rate, and
the fractal dimension of the clusters produced at readily predictable values. The aggregation of ice
crystals to form snowﬂakes is considered as a potential application of the model.

INTRODUCTION

II. MODEL

Simple models of cluster-cluster aggregation have been
the focus of a great deal of interest, particularly over the
last two decades. The structure of aggregates formed
through a variety of dominating mechanisms (eg. diﬀu-
sion limited [1], reaction limited [2] and ballistic motion
[3]) have been studied through theoretical, experimental,
and computational work.

Another aggregation mechanism which is relevant to
several physical systems is that of diﬀerential sedimen-
tation. Particles with a range of size and/or shape will
almost inevitably sediment through a ﬂuid at diﬀerent
speeds under the inﬂuence of gravity, leading to colli-
sions. If there is some mechanism by which the particles
stick on contact then aggregates will be formed. An ex-
ample of this kind of phenomenon is the aggregation of
ice crystals in Cirrus clouds. Small ‘pristine’ ice parti-
cles are formed at the top of the cloud, and proceed to
fall through it, colliding with one another and sticking to
produce aggregates (snowﬂakes).

The aim of this paper is to provide a simple model for
growth by diﬀerential sedimentation which captures the
essential physics of the system in the inertial ﬂow regime,
and to consider its application to snowﬂake formation. It
is divided into ﬁve main parts - a description of the model
and the assumptions underlying it; details of computer
simulations and the results obtained from them; a the-
ory section which oﬀers an argument to account for the
behaviour observed in the simulations; an investigation
of the model’s applicability to snowﬂake formation; and
a concluding discussion.

We focus on the dilute limit, where the mean free
path between cluster-cluster collisions is large compared
to the nearest neighbour distance between clusters. In
this regime we can limit our interest to individual binary
collision events, ignoring spatial correlation. As further
simplifying approximations, we assume that clusters have
random orientations which do not signiﬁcantly change
during a close encounter, and that any cluster-cluster
contacts result in a permanent and rigid junction.

In order to sample the collisions between clusters, we
ﬁrst formulate a rate of close approach. For any two
clusters i, j with nominal radii (see below) ri and rj
respectively and fall speeds vi , vj , the frequency with
which their centres pass closer than a distance (ri + rj )
is given by:

(1)

Γij = π(ri + rj )2 |vi − vj| .
In our computer simulations the nominal radii are chosen
to fully enclose each cluster; collisions are then accurately
sampled by ﬁrst choosing a pair of clusters with proba-
bility proportional to Γij and then checking for collision
along one randomly sampled close approach trajectory.
In the theoretical arguments presented in section four,
we make the simplifying assumption that all close ap-
proaches lead to collisions (or at least a ﬁxed fraction of
them do), using nominal radii based on fractal scaling
from the cluster masses.

The model is completed by an explicit form for the fall
speeds entering equation (1). We assume that the ﬂuid
ﬂow around the clusters will be similar to that around a
sphere of the same linear size. The drag force on a falling
sphere may be written in the form:

Fd = ρνkf (Re)

(2)

where f is a function of the Reynolds number Re = rv/νk
alone, ρ is the density of the surrounding ﬂuid, and νk

is the kinematic viscosity. For the inertial and Stokes
regimes f takes the forms:

f (Re) ∼

Re for viscous ﬂow (cid:27)

.

Here, we consider a general form f (Re) ∼ R

as an adjustable parameter. Setting the drag force equal
to the weight mg of the cluster, the terminal velocity is
then given by

In our simulations we took the radius determining the
fall velocity to be proportional to radius of gyration, and
in our theoretical calculations we simply used the same
nominal radii as for the collision cross sections above.

III. COMPUTER SIMULATIONS AND
RESULTS

The primary particles used at the beginning of the sim-
ulations were rods of zero thickness, half of which had a
length (and mass) of unity, and half of which were twice
as long and massive. Purely monodisperse initial condi-
tions are not possible in this model, since |vi − vj| would
be zero. Apart from this special case however, it is an-
ticipated that the asymptotic behaviour of the system
should be insensitive to the initial distribution, and in-
deed the results described in this section appear to be
preserved for a variety of starting conditions.

In aggregation models it is typically the case (eg. Vic-
sek and Family [4]) that after the distribution has had
time to ‘forget’ its initial conditions it will approach a
universal shape. This is usually expressed by the ‘dy-
namical scaling’ ansatz, which states that as m, s → ∞:

nm(t) = s(t)

−2φ

m
s(t) (cid:21)

(cid:20)

(5)

where nm(t) is the number of clusters of mass m at
time t, and the rescaled distribution φ is a function of
x = m/s(t) alone. The quantity s(t) is a characteris-
tic cluster mass, and for non-gelling systems one expects
that a suitable choice is given by the weight average clus-
ter mass, s(t) =
i mi. Using this choice our
simulation data conform well to scaling, as shown in the
P

left panel of ﬁgure 1.

The shape of the rescaled distribution was studied. A
x φ(x′)dx′ as a function of x is shown in the
plot of
right panel of ﬁgure 1 and shows an exponential decay for
very large x, with a ‘super-exponential’ behaviour taking
over as x approaches unity from above. This behaviour
appears to be universal for all values of α in the range
studied.

2

For x ≪ 1 the qualitative form of φ(x) was found to fall
into two distinct catagories depending on the value of α.
For α ≥ 1
2 the distribution appears to diverge as a power
law: φ(x → 0) ∼ x−τ , as shown in ﬁgure 1 for α = 0.55.
The exponent τ was found to be approximately constant
at τ ≃ 1.6 ± 0.1 over the range 1
2 the
distribution was found to be peaked, with a maximum at
some small size xm, followed by a power law decay for
xm ≪ x ≪ 1.

3 . For α < 1

2 ≤ α ≤ 2

Comparison with other aggregation models suggests
that the clusters produced are likely to be fractal in their
geometry, and in particular cluster mass and (average)
radius should be in a power law relationship m ∼ rdf
where df is the fractal dimension. A log plot of radius of
gyration against mass for all the clusters produced over
the course of the simulation is shown in ﬁgure 2. Also
shown in this ﬁgure is the logarithmic derivative of the
above plot, which shows the variation in the apparent
fractal dimension of the clusters with size. From this
plot, it seems that the fractal dimension approaches an
asymptotic value as m → ∞; in the case shown (α =
0.55) we estimate this value as df ≃ 2.2 ± 0.1. The value
of this limiting fractal dimension was found to be vary
with α as shown in ﬁgure 3.

IV. THEORY

The most common theory used to describe cluster-
cluster aggregation problems is that of von Smoluchowksi
[5], which provides a set of mean-ﬁeld rate equations for
the evolution of the cluster mass distribution:

dnk(t)
dt

=

1
2 Xi+j=k

Kijni(t)nj(t)−nk(t)

Kijnj(t). (6)

∞

Xj=1

where nk(t) is the number of clusters of mass k at time
t (per unit volume). The kernel Kij contains the physics
of the problem, being a symmetric matrix, the elements
of which govern the rate of aggregation between pairs of
clusters expressed (only) in terms of their masses i and
j. Analytical solutions of Smoluchowski’s equations have
not been obtained except for a few special cases of Kij.
However, Van Dongen and Ernst [6] have shown that for
non-gelling kernels (see below) the solutions approach the
dynamical scaling form of equation (5) in the large-mass,
large-time limit; substituting this into equations (6) al-
lows one to obtain some information about the asymp-
totic behaviour of the rescaled cluster size distribution
φ(x).

To apply this theory we need to compute the reaction
rates Kij , which means averaging collision rate with re-
spect to cluster geometry at ﬁxed masses. This we es-
timate by substituting averages from fractal scaling for
the radii in equations (1) for the close approach rate and
(4) for the fall speeds, and assuming constant collision
eﬃciency leading to:

Our identiﬁcation of the exponent ν is crucial to a

the dynamics.
If the fractal dimension is low enough,
then the exponent ν will exceed unity. However, Van

FIG. 3: Variation of the fractal dimension as a function of the

nario the growth of the large clusters approaches that of
ballistic particle-cluster aggregation, where it has been
shown by Ball and Witten [8] that the fractal dimen-
sion of the clusters produced tends to df = 3. This in-
creased fractal dimension reduces the value of ν, forcing
it back to a value of one if α ≤ 2
3 . Through this feedback
mechanism, a bound is placed on the fractal dimension
df ≥ max[2, (1 − α)−1] for α ≤ 2
3 .

The system could perhaps settle in a state where ν < 1.
However, the growth in such a regime is much less biased
towards collisions between clusters of disparate sizes, and
the distribution is relatively monodisperse. This would
tend to make collisions between clusters of a similar size
likely, leading to much more open structures, with a lower
fractal dimension, in turn acting as a feedback mecha-
nism to increase the value of ν. The authors suggest
that, at least over some range of α, this eﬀect will force
the system towards the ν = 1 state. The discontinuity
in the polydispersity of the system at ν = 1 forces the
system to organise itself such that it can remain at that
point. This is similar to the argument put forward by
Ball et al [2] for reaction limited aggregation.

If it is accepted that ν → 1 then the fractal dimension
of the clusters produced ought to be directly predictable
from equation (10) :

df = max[2, (1 − α)

−1], α ≤

(11)

.

A curve showing this theoretical behaviour is superim-
posed on the simulation data in ﬁgure 3, and appears to
show good agreement up to α ≃ 2
3 . For α > 2
3 the theo-
retical prediction is that df = 3 and ν = α + 1
3 > 1, but
because of its somewhat pathological nature we have not
attempted to make simulations in this regime. It is how-
ever clear from the extrapolation of our results in ﬁgure
3 that this is likely to hold.

Obtaining an exact form for the cluster size distribu-

4

tion φ(x) is a non-trivial exercise. However, following the
methodology of Van Dongen and Ernst [6], we consider
the small-x behaviour of φ(x) when df < α−1 (ie. µ < 0).
In such a regime the small-x behaviour is dominated by
collisions between clusters of disparate sizes; the gain
term in the Smoluchowski equations may therefore be ne-
glected, and one attempts to solve the integro-diﬀerential
∞
equation: w[xφ′(x) + 2φ(x)] = φ(x)
0 K(x, y)φ(y)dy.
For x ≪ y, the kernel (7) may be approximated to
R
K(x, y) ≃ xµyν − yλ, and one obtains:

φ(x) = x

−τ exp

xµpν
wµ (cid:21)

(cid:20)

(12)

where pi is the ith moment of the rescaled distribution
φ(x), and the exponent τ is given by τ = 2 + pλw−1.
It is clear that limx→0[φ(x)] = 0. As x increases from
zero, φ(x) also increases, until reaching a maximum at
xm = (wτ /pν)1/µ. For xm ≪ x ≪ 1 the distribution
has an approximately algebraic decay φ(x) ∼ x−τ . This
‘bell-shaped’ curve is consistent with the behaviour seen
in the computer simulations when α < 1
2 .

In the case df > α−1, it has been shown [6] that for
all kernels with µ = 0, ν ≤ 1 the cluster size distribution
diverges as x → 0 with the form

−τ

φ(x) ∼ x
(13)
where τ = 2 − pλw−1. This behaviour is consistent with
the simulation for α ≥ 1
2 . The change in the qualitative
shape of φ(x ≪ 1) around α = 1
2 then is further evidence
to suggest that the system selects to sit at ν = 1.

The shape of φ(x ≫ 1) has also been studied by Van
Dongen and Ernst [9]. They have shown that for non-
gelling kernels, the tail of the distribution is expected to
take the form

φ(x) ∼ x

−θe

−δx

(14)

where θ and δ are constants. This would appear to be
consistent with the behaviour observed in the simulations
for all values of α, providing an exponentially dominated
cut-oﬀ at large x.

V. APPLICATION TO SNOWFLAKE
FORMATION

The principle motivation for the model presented in
this paper was to attempt to understand some of the
properties of Cirrus clouds. Amongst others, Heymsﬁeld
and Platt [10] have observed that these clouds are pre-
dominantly composed of columns, bullets, bullet-rosettes
and aggregates of these crystal types. It is these aggre-
gates which we hope to model, since the dominant mech-
anism by which they grow is believed to be through dif-
ferential sedimentation (eg. Field and Heymsﬁeld [11]).
We therefore ignore the eﬀects of diﬀusional growth, tur-
bulence, mixing, and particle breakup, in order to con-
centrate on the eﬀects of this mechanism alone. The

FIG. 4: Aspect ratio of simulation clusters as a function of
their maximum dimension. The curve seems to approach an
asymptotic value of ≃ 0.65, independent of the initial condi-
tions used: here we show data for both rods and rosettes.

Reynolds number for aggregates of a few crystals is typi-
cally between ≃ 10—100 which ought to be modelled ac-
ceptably by our inertial ﬂow approximation. Because we
have not modelled the detailed hydrodynamics we may
also be ignoring subtleties such as wake capture.

All of the results below are presented for the purely
inertial regime (assumed to be the most relevant to this
problem) where α = 1
2 . The initial particles were rods
of zero thickness - however, the asymptotic behaviour is
anticipated to be insensitive to the initial conditions, and
indeed by running the simulation with ‘bullet rosettes’ for
the initial particles (three rods, crossing one another at
right angles, through a common centre), no change in the
end results were found, only in the approach to scaling.
The fractal dimension of the snowﬂakes in Cirrus may
be inferred from the work of Heymsﬁeld et al [12]. By
measuring the eﬀective density ρe of bullet and bullet-
rosette aggregates as a function of their maximum linear
dimension D, and ﬁtting a power law to their data, they
found the relationship ρe ∼ D−0.96. This scaling implies
that the aggregates have a fractal dimension of approx-
imately df = 2.04, which is consistent with the values
predicted by our model (simulation giving df = 2.05±0.1
and theory giving df = 2).

The aspect ratio of the clusters may also be calcu-
lated. Random projections of simulation clusters were
taken. The maximum dimension of the projection D was
measured, as was the maximum dimension in the direc-
tion perpendicular to that longest axis, Dw. The ratio
of these two spans were binned by maximum dimension,
averaged, and plotted as a function of D as shown in ﬁg-
ure 4. The ratio quickly approaches an asymptotic value
of approximately 0.65 ± 0.05. This compares well to the
measurements of Korolev and Isaac [13], where the ra-
tio seems to approach a value of ≃ 0.6 − 0.7. Finally,
the shape of the snowﬂake distribution of linear size may
also be compared with experiment. Field and Heymsﬁeld

5

[11] presented particle size distributions of the maximum
length D of ice particles in a Cirrus cloud. The data were
obtained with an aircraft and represent in-cloud averages
of particle size distributions (number per unit volume per
particle size bin width) along 15km ﬂight tracks ranging
from an altitude of 9500m (−50◦C) to 6600m (−28◦C).
To compare this data to the distributions obtained from
simulation, we ﬁrst normalise the data, and then make
use of the dynamical scaling form (5), to collapse the dis-
tributions onto a single curve. Details of this are given
in the appendix to this paper. The resulting histograms
are shown in ﬁgure 5 and appear to show quite good
agreement, given the level of approximation present in
our model.

VI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

A simple mean-ﬁeld model of aggregation by diﬀeren-
tial sedimentation of particles in an inertial ﬂow regime
has been constructed, simulated by computer, and anal-
ysed theoretically in terms of the Smoluchowski equa-
tions. It has been shown that there is strong numerical
evidence, in addition to a theoretical argument, to back
up the idea that the polydispersity of the distribution and
the fractal dimension feed back on one another in such a
way as to stabilise the system at ν = 1. Above this value,
the dominance of collisions between clusters of very dif-
ferent sizes is so great as to push df towards a value of
three. This in turn pulls the exponent ν back down to
unity. For ν < 1 the system is quite monodisperse, re-
sulting in relatively many collisions between clusters of
similar sizes, and the fractal dimension is reduced, forcing
ν back up. The discontinuity in the shape of the distribu-
tion around ν = 1 is thought to provide the mechanism
by which the system can stabilise at that point.

If it is accepted that ν → 1, then the fractal dimension
of the clusters produced may be predicted, and ﬁgure 3
shows that this prediction agrees well with simulation re-
sults for 0 ≤ α ≤ 2
3 . The sudden change in the behaviour
of df (α) and in the small-x form of the cluster size dis-
tribution around α = 1
2 is also strong evidence for the
self-organisation proposed between df and ν.

For α > 2

3 the system is forced into a regime where
ν > 1, which has been regarded as unphysical because
the Smoluchowski equation (6) predicts inﬁnite clusters
in zero time [7]. In the light of our results this regime
merits further study beyond the Smoluchowski equation
approximation [14]. The value α = 1 is given by viscous
ﬂow, but here our form for Γij does not include all of
the relevant physics: in particular, small clusters may be
caught in the ﬂuid ﬂow, and swept around larger clusters
rather than hitting them, reducing the dominance of big-
little collisions. This has been discussed in more detail
for the particle-cluster aggregation case by Warren et al
[15].

The application of the model to the formation of ice
crystal aggregates in Cirrus clouds has been considered:

the fractal dimension, aspect ratio, and shape of the clus-

indication that the ideas presented in this paper may be
an acceptable model for the essential physics of snowﬂake
aggregation in Cirrus.

APPENDIX: SCALING OF THE CLUSTER
RADIUS DISTRIBUTION

Experiments have reported the distribution of ice ag-
gregates by linear span rather than by mass, and we
present here how that distribution dN
dD should naturally
be rescaled. This tests the dynamical scaling ansatz
which,
dm = nm =
s−aφ(m/s), where a = 2 in mass-conserving systems. We
anticipate fractal scaling so that m ∼ Ddf and hence:

measured τ ≃ 1.6, df ≃ 2, and so the lowest integer mo-
ment which scales in this way is the second. We therefore

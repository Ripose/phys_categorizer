Abstract

We present a parabolic approximation that incorporates reﬂection. With this approximation, there
is no need to solve the parabolic equation for a coupled pair of solutions consisting of the incident and
reﬂected waves. Rather, this approximation uses a synthetic wave whose spectral components manifest
the incident and reﬂected waves.

The (Leontovich-Fock) parabolic approximation, which approximates the elliptic Helmholtz equation by
a parabolic partial diﬀerential equation, was originally applied to electromagnetic propagation.1 Tappert
and Hardin introduced the parabolic approximation to acoustic propagation in the ocean to account for
inseparable range eﬀects in the sound speed proﬁle.2 In ocean acoustics, the parabolic equation is a useful
computational tool for tackling inseparable indices of refraction for which the sound speed proﬁle changes
slowly with respect to range.

One of the deﬁciencies of the standard parabolic approximation is that it neglects backscatter. Heretofore,
to account for backscatter, one solved the parabolic equation for a coupled pair of solutions (the incident
and reﬂected solutions). Attempts to account for backscatter include among others the works of Collins
et al, which uses a two-way parabolic approximation.3 Herein, we present a diﬀerent approach to include
backscatter. Based on rigorous ray tracing, we combine the incident and reﬂected waves into a modulated
synthetic wave that progresses in the incident direction.

Rigorous ray tracing has been developed in a generalized Hamilton-Jacobi representation that accounts
for terms ignored by classical ray tracing and other asymptotic methods.
It has provided insight into
propagation phenomena. Rigorous ray tracing has shown that the existence of a sound-speed gradient
is suﬃcient to induce linear (material) dispersion and angular (geometric) dispersion even for isotropic
frequency-independent sound-speed proﬁles, that rays are not generally orthogonal to wave fronts, that
classical ray tracing does not predict all caustics, and that rigorous ray tracing may be solved in closed form
whenever the corresponding wave equation may be solved in closed form.4 Its quantum mechanical analogy,
the trajectory representation, has shown how to derive the Helmholtz equation (the stationary Schr¨odinger
equation) from the generalized Hamilton-Jacobi equation.5 This allows us to construct the wave function or
normal mode from Hamilton’s characteristic function (a generator of the motion for the trajectory or ray
path). These normal modes can be synthetic normal modes that contain the incident and reﬂected waves as
spectral components.6 We shall use such a normal mode to develop the parabolic equation that accounts for
reﬂection.

Our objective in this letter is to present a parabolic equation that accounts for reﬂection. It is beyond
the scope of this letter to solve the resultant parabolic equation. The acoustical community is free to solve

this equation by the methods of their choice. This work is presented in two dimensions, which is suﬃcient
to illustrate how to incorporate reﬂection into the parabolic equation.

We assume that the ocean to ﬁrst order is a stratiﬁed medium whose index of refraction varies with depth
due to temperature and pressure changes. The range dependence of the index of refraction is second order.
This index of refraction is dependent upon two cartesian coordinates: (x, z) for range and depth respectively.
The index of refraction varies much more rapidly in the z-direction then in the x-direction. We also assume
that, for propagation of a wave train through the ocean medium, the reﬂected wave is much smaller than
the incident wave consistent with the concept of backscatter.

Recently, the trajectory representation of quantum mechanics (the quantum analogue to rigorous ray
tracing) showed how the reﬂected and incident waves can be combined to synthesize a wave whose front
monotonically advances in the direction of incidence6. The synthetic wave is given by

where α is the amplitude of incident wave and β is the amplitude of reﬂected wave, where |β| < |α|, and
where k is the wavenumber and ω is the angular frequency. This synthetic wave is a normal mode (follows
from the superposition principle).

The synthetic wave has spatially modulation in phase and amplitude as shown by right side of Eq. (1).
For completeness, the right side of Eq. (1) was derived from the generator of the motion for the trajectory
in Ref. 6, and the left side was subsequently developed by analysis. While the right side of Eq. (1) was
ﬁrst developed from Hamilton’s characteristic function by the quantum analogy to rigorous ray tracing,6 we
subsequently learned how to do it in a wave representation. This is the contribution of rigorous ray tracing
that we use here.

The wave equation in two dimensions is given by

∂2Ψ/∂x2 + ∂2Ψ/∂z2 = C

−2(x, z)∂2Ψ/∂t2

The speed of sound, C, is isotropic and only spatially dependent. The wave equation is separable in time
so that Ψ(x, z, t) = ψ(x, z) exp(iωt) Hence, the wave equation is reduced to the two-dimensional Helmholtz
equation

where κ(x, z) = ω/C(x, z).

For reference, the standard parabolic approximation substitutes

∂2ψ/∂x2 + ∂2ψ/∂z2 + κ2(x, z)ψ = 0

into Eq. (2) to produce, after a standard simpliﬁcation, the standard parabolic equation given by7

ψ(x, z) = θstandard(x)φstandard(x, z) = exp(ikx)φstandard(x, z)

There is ﬂexibility in choosing the form of θ. Diﬀerent choices of θ lead to diﬀerent parabolic equations.7
We have chosen a θ that is the spatial component of the synthetic wave, Eq. (1). This θ includes reﬂection
while progressing in the incident direction. In the standard parabolic equation, the corresponding θstandard
in Eq. (3) is given by θstandard = exp(ikx), which only includes the incident wave. Substituting ψ = θφ into
the Helmholtz equation leads to

For small reﬂections, β ≪ α, Eq. (5) may be simpliﬁed to

∂θ/∂x
θ

= ik[1 − (2β/α) cos(2kx)] exp[i(2β/α) sin(2kx)] + O[(β/α)2].

Now the transformed Helmholtz equation for small reﬂection becomes

The critical assumption for the validity of the parabolic assumptions is that φ is well behaved (smooth) in
range so that

This assumption, Eq. (6) is standard for simplifying the elliptic Helmhotz equation to an approximating
parabolic equation. The resulting parabolic wave equation with reﬂection to ﬁrst order in (β/α) is given by

Equation (7) is the parabolic equation that incorporates reﬂection. The diﬀerence between Eq. (7) and the
standard parabolic equation, Eq. (4), is the additional factor exp[i(2β/α) exp(i2kx)] in the ∂φ/∂x term in
Eq. (7). Relative reﬂection as a function of the fraction β/α is thereby incorporated to ﬁrst order into φ(x, z).
In order to account for the eﬀect of reﬂection, contemporary solutions to the parabolic approximation
solve the parabolic equation for an interacting pair of solutions (incident and reﬂected) or decouple the pair
by simpliﬁcation.3,7 Herein, we avoid the problem of coupled solutions. Our solution to Eq. (7) is a single
synthetic wave that manifests both the incident and reﬂected wave throughout the domain.

The initialization of φ at some initial range, xi, over the depth column, z, renders the value, φ(xi, z),
over an open boundary thereby establishing the Dirichlet boundary conditions for a unique, stable solution

for φ.8 This initialization process is similar to that for the standard parabolic equation, but here we must
also specify the fraction β/α. (As a starter, one could use Urick9 and the references therein to predict β/α
from reverberation and backscatter.) Solving Eq. (7) (which is beyond the scope of this letter) in practice,
one must not only take the usual precautions associated with the standard parabolic approximation but also
take into account that Eq. (7) is an approximation that ignores some second-order terms of (β/α).

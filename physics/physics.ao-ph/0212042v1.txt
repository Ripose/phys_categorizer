We use several variants of the detrended ﬂuctuation analysis to study the appearance of long-term persistence
in temperature records, obtained at 95 stations all over the globe. Our results basically conﬁrm earlier studies.
We ﬁnd that the persistence, characterized by the correlation C(s) of temperature variations separated by s days,
decays for large s as a power law, C(s) ∼ s−γ. For continental stations, including stations along the coast lines,
we ﬁnd that γ is always close to 0.7. For stations on islands, we ﬁnd that γ ranges between 0.3 and 0.7, with
a maximum at γ = 0.4. This is consistent with earlier studies of the persistence in sea surface temperature
records where γ is close to 0.4. By varying the degree of detrending in the ﬂuctuation analysis we obtain also
information about trends in the temperature records.

I. INTRODUCTION

The persistence of weather states on short terms is a well-
known phenomenon: A warm day is more likely to be fol-
lowed by a warm day than by a cold day and vice versa. The
trivial forecast, that the weather of tomorrow is the same as
the weather of today, was in previous times often used as a
”minimum skill” forecast for assessing the usefulness of short
term weather forecasts. The typical time scale for weather
changes is about one week, a time period which corresponds
to the average duration of so-called “general weather regimes”
or “Grosswetterlagen”, so this type of short-term persistence
usually stops after about one week. On larger scales, other
types of persistence occur. One of them is related to circula-
tion patterns associated with blocking [1]. A blocking situa-
tion occurs when a very stable high pressure system is estab-
lished over a particular region and remains in place for sev-
eral weeks. As a result the weather in the region of the high
remains fairly persistent throughout this period. Furthermore,
transient low pressure systems are deﬂected around the block-
ing high so that the region downstream of the high experiences
a larger than usual number of storms. On even longer terms, a
source for weather persistence might be slowly varying exter-
nal (boundary) forcing such as sea surface temperatures and
anomaly patterns. On the scale of months to seasons, one of
the most pronounced phenomenon is the El Nino Southern
Oscillation (ENSO) event which occurs every 3-5 years and
which strongly affects the weather over the tropical Paciﬁc as
well as over North America [2].

The question is, how the persistence that might be gener-
ated by very different mechanisms on different time scales,
decays with time s. The answer to this question is not easy.
Correlations, and in particular long-term correlations, can be
masked by trends that are generated, e.g., by the well known
urban warming. Even uncorrelated data in the presence of
long-term trends may look like correlated ones, and, on the
other hand, long-term correlated data may look like uncorre-
lated data inﬂuenced by a trend.

Therefore, in order to distinguish between trends and cor-

relations one needs methods that can systematically eliminate
trends. Those methods are available now: both wavelet tech-
niques (WT) (see e. g. [3–6]) and detrended ﬂuctuation anal-
ysis (DFA) (see, e. g. [7–10]) can systematically eliminate
trends in the data and thus reveal intrinsic dynamical proper-
ties such as distributions, scaling and long-range correlations
very often masked by nonstationarities.

In a previous study [11], we have used DFA and WT to
study temperature correlations in different climatic zones on
the globe. The analysis focussed on 14 continental stations,
several of them were located along coast lines. The results in-
dicated that the temperature variations are long-range power-
law correlated above some crossover time that is of the order
of 10 days. Above the crossover time, the persistence, charac-
terized by the auto-correlation C(s) of temperature variations
separated by s days, decays as

C(s) ∼ s−γ,

(1)

where, most interestingly, the exponent γ had roughly the
same value γ ∼= 0.7 for all continental records. Equation (1)
can be used as a test bed for global climate models [12].

More recently, DFA was applied to study temperature cor-
relations in the sea surface temperatures [13]. It was found
that the temperature autocorrelation function C(s) again de-
cayed by a power law, but with an exponent γ close to 0.4,
pointing towards a stronger persistence in the oceans than in
the continents.

In this paper, we considerably extend our previous analy-
sis to study systematically temperature records of 95 stations.
Most of them are on the continents, and several of them are
on islands. Our results are actually in line with both earlier
papers and in agreement with conclusions drawn from inde-
pendent type of analysis by several groups [14–18]. We ﬁnd
that the continental records, including those on coast lines,
show power-law persistence with γ close to 0.7, while the is-
land records show power-law correlations with γ around 0.4.
By comparing different orders of DFA that differ in the way
trends are eliminated, we could also study the presence of

1

trends in the records that lead to a warming of the atmosphere.
We ﬁnd that pronounced trends occur mainly at big cities and
can be probably attributed to urban growth. Trends that can-
not be attributed to urban gowth occur in half of the island
stations considered and on summit stations in the Alps. The
majority of the stations showed no indications of trends.

The article is organized as follows: In Section 2, we de-
scribe the detrending analysis used in this paper, the detrended
ﬂuctuation analysis (DFA). In Section 3, we present the result
of this analysis. Section 4 concludes the paper with a discus-
sion.

II. THE METHODS OF ANALYSIS

Consider a record Ti, where the index i counts the days in
the record, i = 1,2,...,N . The Ti represent the maximum daily
temperature, measured at a certain meteorological station. For
eliminating the periodic seasonal trends, we concentrate on
the departures of the Ti, ∆Ti = Ti − T i, from their mean
daily value T i for each calendar date i, say 2nd of March,
which has been obtained by averaging over all years in the
record.

Quantitatively, correlations between two ∆Ti values sepa-
rated by n days are deﬁned by the (auto) correlation function

C(n) ≡ h∆Ti∆Ti+ni =

∆Ti∆Ti+n.

X
i=1

If the ∆Ti are uncorrelated, C(n) is zero for n positive. If
correlations exist up to a certain number of days n×, the cor-
relation function will be positive up to n× and vanish above
n×. A direct calculation of C(n) is hindered by the level of
noise present in the ﬁnite records, and by possible nonstation-
arities in the data.

To reduce the noise we do not calculate C(n) directly, but

instead study the “proﬁle”

Ym =

∆Ti.

For the analysis of the ﬂuctuations, we employ a hierarchy
of methods that differ in the way the ﬂuctuations are measured
and possible trends are eliminated (for a detailed description
of the methods we refer to [9]).

(i) In the simplest type of ﬂuctuation analysis (DFA0)
(where trends are not going to be eliminated), we determine
in each window the mean value of the proﬁle. The variance
of the proﬁle from this constant value represents the square of
the ﬂuctuations in each window.

(ii) In the ﬁrst order detrended ﬂuctuation analysis (DFA1),
we determine in each window the best linear ﬁt of the proﬁle.
The variance of the proﬁle from this straight line represents
the square of the ﬂuctuations in each window.

(iii) In general, in the n-th order DFA (DFAn) we deter-
mine in each window the best n-th order polynomial ﬁt of the
proﬁle. The variance of the proﬁle from these best n-th order
polynomials represents the square of the ﬂuctuations in each
window.

By deﬁnition, DFA0 does not eliminate trends, similar to
the Hurst method and the conventional power spectral meth-
ods [20]. In contrast, DFAn eliminates trends of order n in
the proﬁle and n − 1 in the original time series. Thus, from
the comparison of ﬂuctuation functions F (s) obtained from
different methods one can learn about both, long-term corre-
lations and the inﬂuence of trends, which cannot be achieved
by the conventional techniques.

We can consider the proﬁle Ym as the position of a random
walker on a linear chain after m steps. The random walker
starts at the origin and performs, in the ith step, a jump of
length ∆Ti to the right, if ∆Ti is positive, and to the left,
if ∆Ti is negative. The ﬂuctuations F 2(s) of the proﬁle, in
a given time window of size s, are related to the correlation
function C(s). For the relevant case (1) of long-range power-
law correlations, C(s) ∼ s−γ,
0 < γ < 1, the mean-
square ﬂuctuations F 2(s), obtained by averaging over many
time windows of size s (see below) asymptotically increase
by a power law [19],

F 2(s) ∼ s2α, α = 1 − γ/2.

For uncorrelated data (as well as for correlations decaying
faster than 1/s), we have α = 1/2.

Vienna and Perm have continental climate, while Charleston
and Pusan are close to coast lines.

In the log-log plots the DFA1-5 curves are (except at small
s-values) approximately straight lines. For both the sta-
tions inside the continents and along coast lines the slope is
α ∼= 0.65. There exists a natural crossover (above the DFA-
crossovers at very small times) that can be best estimated from
DFA0. As can be veriﬁed easily, the crossover occurs roughly
at sc = 10 days, which is the order of magnitude for a typ-
ical Grosswetterlage. Above sc, there exists long-range per-
sistence expressed by the power-law decay of the correlation
function with an exponent γ = 2 − 2α ∼= 0.7.

FIG. 2.: Analysis of daily temperature records of 2 representative
weather stations on islands. The DFA-curves are arranged as in ﬁg-
ure 1.

Figure 2 shows the results of the DFA analysis of the daily
temperatures for two island stations: Wrangelja and Camp-
bell Islands. Wrangelja Island is a large island between the
East Siberian Sea and the Chukchi Sea. During the winter sea-
son, large parts of the water surrounding the island are usually
frozen. Campbell Island is a small island belonging to New
Zealand. Again, in the double logarithmic presentation, all
DFA1-5 ﬂuctuation functions are straight lines, but the slopes
differ. While for Wrangelja the slope is 0.65, similar to the
land stations shown before, the slope for Campbell Island is
signiﬁcantly larger, close to 0.8 (corresponding to γ = 0.4).

It can be seen from Figures 1 and 2 that sometimes the
DFA0 curves have a larger slope than the DFA1-5-curves, and
that usually the curves of DFA2-5 have the same slope for
large s values. The fact that the DFA0-curve has a higher
exponent indicates the existence of trends by which the long-
term correlations are masked. Calculations using DFA0 alone
will yield a higher correlation exponent and thus lead to a spu-
rious overestimation of the long-term persistence. The fact
that the DFA2-5 curves show the same asymptotic behavior
indicates that possible nonlinearities in the trends are not sig-
niﬁcant. Otherwise the DFA2 curve (where only linear trends
are eliminated) would show an asymptotic behavior different
from DFA3-5.

By comparing the DFA0 curves with the DFA2 curves, we
can learn more about possible trends. Usually the effect of
trends is seen as a crossover in the DFA0 curve. Below the
crossover, the slope of DFA0 and DFA2 are roughly the same,
while above the crossover the DFA0 curve bends up. Large

trends are characterized by a short crossovertime sc and a
large difference in the slopes between DFA0 and DFA2 (for
a general discussion see [9] and [10]). A nice example for
this represents Vienna, where the DFA0 curve shows a pro-
nounced crossover at about 3y. Above this crossover, the
DFA0 curve bends up considerably, with an effective slope
close to 0.8. For Pusan, the trend is less pronounced, and for
Perm, Charleston and the two islands we do not see indica-
tions of trends.

Wuxqiaoling (C, 40 y), 20. Zugspitze (D, 98 y). Stations 1-3 are
on islands, stations 4-9 are on coast lines, stations 10-20 are inland
stations, among them 2 stations (19 and 20) on summits. The scales
are arbitrary. The ﬂuctuation functions have been divided by s0.65.

To reveal the presence of long-term correlations and to
point out possible trends, we have plotted in Figure 3a the
DFA0 curves and in Figure 3b the DFA2 curves for 20 repre-
sentative stations around the globe. For convenience, the ﬂuc-
tuation functions have been divided by s0.65. We do not show
results for those stations that were analyzed in [11]. Figure
3b shows again, that continental and coast line stations have
roughly the same ﬂuctuation exponent α ∼= 0.65, while is-
lands may also have higher exponents. It seems that stations
at peaks of high mountains (here we show Zugspitze (D, 98
y, No.19) and Wuxqiaoling (C, 40 y, No.20)) have a slightly
lower exponent.

From the 26 stations shown in Figures 1-3, 8 show a larger
exponent in the DFA0 treatment than in the DFA2 treatment.

3

These stations are Thursday Island (No. 1 in Fig. 3), Koror
Island (No. 2 in Fig. 3), as well as Vienna (Fig. 1a), Pusan
(Fig. 1d), Hong Kong (No. 4 in Fig. 3), Jena (No. 10 in
Fig. 3), Cheyenne (No. 17 in Fig. 3) and Zugspitze (No. 19
in Fig. 3). The other 18 stations do not show a difference in
the exponents for DFA0 and DFA2, which suggests that the
trends are either zero or too small to be detected by this sen-
sitive method. We observe the largest trends for Hong Kong,
Vienna, and Jena, where in all cases the crossover in the DFA0
curve are around 3y and the ﬁnal slope is between0.75 and 0.8.
It is obvious that the greatest part of this warming is due to the
urban growth of theses cities. Regarding the two islands, Ko-
ror shows a pronounced trend with a crossover time below 1y,
while the trend we observe for Thursday Island is compara-
tively weak. It is not likely that the trends on the islands can
be attributed to urban warming.

FIG. 4.: Histogram of the values of the ﬂuctuation exponents α ob-
tained (a) from DFA0 where trends are not eliminated and (b) from
DFA2 where linear trends are eliminated systematically on all time
scales.

Figure 4 summarizes our results for all stations analysed.
Figure 4a shows the histogram for the values of the exponent
α obtained by DFA0, while Figure 4b shows the correspond-
ing histogram obtained by DFA2. Both histograms are quite
similar. For DFA2 the average exponent α is 0.66 ± 0.06 and
for DFA0 it is 0.68 ± 0.07. The maxima become sharper when
the islands are eliminated from the ﬁgures. The slight shift
towards larger α-values in DFA0 is due to trends. The magni-
tude of the trends can be roughly characterized by the differ-
ence δα of the slopes of DFA0 and DFA2. We found that 7
of the 15 island stations and 54 of the 80 continental stations
showed no siginﬁcant trend, with δα ≤ 0.02. We observed a
small trend, with 0.03 ≤ δα ≤ 0.05, for 3 island and 9 con-
tinental stations. A pronounced trend, with δα ≥ 0.06, was
found for 5 island and 13 continental stations. Among these
13 stations are Hong Kong, Bordeaux, Prag, Seoul, Sydney,
Urumchi, Swerdlowsk, and Vienna, where a large part of the

warming can be attributed to the urban growth of the cities
in the last century. Two of these stations (S¨antis (CH) and
Sonnblick (A)) are on top of high mountains.

IV. DISCUSSION

In this paper, we have used a hierarchy of detrending analy-
sis methods (DFA0-DFA5) to study long temperature records
around the globe. We concentrated mainly on those areas on
the globe (Noth America, Europe, Asia and Australia) where
long records are available. The main results of the study are:
(i) The temperature persistence decays, after a crossover
time that is typically of the order of the duration of a Gross-
wetterlage, by a power law, with an exponent α that has a very
narrow distribution for continental stations. The mean value
of the exponent is close to 0.65, in agreement with earlier cal-
culations based on different methods [11,14–18].

(ii) On islands, the exponent shows a broader distribution,
varying from 0.65 to 0.85, with an average value close to 0.8.
This ﬁnding is in qualitative agreement with the results of a
recent analysis of sea surface temperature records, where also
long-term persistence with an average exponent close to 0.8
has been found [13]. Since the oceans cover more than 2/3 of
the globe, one may expect that also the mean global tempera-
ture is characterized by long-term persistence, with an expo-
nent close to 0.8.

(iii) In the vast majority of stations we did not see indi-
cations for a global warming of the atmosphere. Exceptions
are mountain stations in the Alps (Zugspitze (D), S¨antis (CH),
and Sonnblick (A)), where urban warming can be excluded.
Also, in half of the islands we studied, we found pronounced
trends that most probably cannot be attributed to urban warm-
ing. Most of the continental stations where we observed sig-
niﬁcant trends are large cities where probably the fast urban
growth in the last century gave rise to temperature increases.
When analysing warming effects in the atmosphere it is es-
sential to use methods that can distinguish, in a systematic
way, between trends and long-term correlations. When esti-
mating the increase in temperature in the last 100y, conven-
tional methods have been applied where trends and long-term
correlations are not distinguished in a systematic way (see
[21]). In this case, natural variability and trends are mixed
up and reliable estimations are hard to obtain, see also [22].
The fact that we did not see trends in the vast majority of sta-
tions that cannot be attributed to urban growth, may indicate
that the actual increase in temperature has been exaggerated
in the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change)
report [22].

Metastability in simple climate models:
Pathwise analysis of slowly driven Langevin equations

Nils Berglund and Barbara Gentz

Abstract

We consider simple stochastic climate models, described by slowly time-dependent
Langevin equations. We show that when the noise intensity is not too large, these
systems can spend substantial amounts of time in metastable equilibrium, instead of
adiabatically following the stationary distribution of the frozen system. This behaviour
can be characterized by describing the location of typical paths, and bounding the
probability of atypical paths. We illustrate this approach by giving a quantitative
description of phenomena associated with bistability, for three famous examples of
simple climate models: Stochastic resonance in an energy balance model describing
Ice Ages; hysteresis in a box model for the Atlantic thermohaline circulation; and
bifurcation delay in the case of the Lorenz model for Rayleigh–B´enard convection.

Introduction

One of the main diﬃculties of realistic climate models is that they involve a huge number
of interacting degrees of freedom, on a wide range of time and length scales.
In order
to be able to control these models analytically, or at least numerically, it is necessary
to simplify them by eliminating the less relevant degrees of freedom (e. g. high-frequency
or short-wavelength modes). A possible way to do this is to average the equations of
motion over all fast degrees of freedom, a rather drastic approximation. As proposed by
Hasselmann [20] (see also [2]), a more realistic approximation is obtained by modeling the
eﬀect of fast degrees of freedom by noise.

In a number of cases, it is appropriate to distinguish between three rather than two time
scales: Fast degrees of freedom (e. g. the “weather”), which are modeled by a stochastic
process; intermediate “dominant modes” (e. g. the average temperature of the atmosphere)
whose dynamics we want to predict; and slow degrees of freedom (e. g. the mean insolation
depending on the eccentricity of the Earth’s orbit), which evolve on very long time scales
of several centuries or millennia, and can be viewed as an external forcing. Such a system
can often be modeled by a slowly time-dependent Langevin equation

dxt = f (xt, εt) dt + σG(εt) dWt,

(1.1)

where the adiabatic parameter ε and the noise intensity σ are small parameters, Wt is a
standard vector-valued Wiener process (describing white noise) and G is a matrix.

Our aim in this paper is to describe the eﬀect of the noise term on the dynamics of (1.1),
assuming the dynamics without noise is known. For this purpose, we will concentrate on
bistable systems, which frequently occur in simple climate models: For instance, in models
for the major Ice Ages, where the two possible stable equilibria correspond to warm and
cold climate [4], or in models of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation [34, 30]. Noise
may enable transitions between the two stable states, which would be impossible in the
deterministic case, and our main concern will be to quantify this eﬀect.

The method used to study the stochastic diﬀerential equation (SDE) (1.1) will depend
on the time scale we are interested in. Let us ﬁrst illustrate this on a static one-dimensional
example, namely the overdamped motion in a symmetric double-well potential:

xt(ω) is continuous. Instead of computing the time needed for p(x, t)

by Freidlin and Wentzell [18]. In speciﬁc situations, more precise results are available, for
instance subexponential corrections to the asymptotic expression (1.6), see [3, 15]. Even
the limiting behaviour of the distribution of the ﬁrst-exit time from a neighbourhood
of a unique stable equilibrium point has been obtained [14]. The ﬁrst-exit time from a
neighbourhood of a saddle has been considered by Kifer in the seminal paper [25].

If the noise intensity σ is small (compared to the square root of the barrier height),

scales shorter than Kramers’ time, solutions of (1.2) starting in one potential well will
hardly feel the second potential well. As we will see in Section 2, xt is well approximated
by an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process, describing the overdamped motion of a particle in a
potential of constant curvature c = 2a. The Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process relaxes to a
stationary Gaussian process with variance σ2/(2c) in a characteristic time

t
This phenomenon, where a process seems stationary for a long time before ultimately
relaxing to a new (possibly stationary) state, is known as metastability. It is all the more
remarkable in an asymmetric double-well potential: then a process starting at the bottom
of the shallow well will ﬁrst relax to a metastable distribution concentrated in the shallow
well, which is radically diﬀerent from the stationary distribution having most of its mass
concentrated in the deeper well.

A diﬀerent approach, based on the concept of random attractors (see [12, 31, 1]), gives

that for arbitrarily weak noise, paths of (1.2) with diﬀerent initial conditions but same
realization of noise almost surely converge to a random point. The time needed for this
convergence, however, diverges rapidly in the limit σ
0, because paths starting in dif-
ferent potential wells are unlikely to overcome the potential barrier and start approaching
each other before Kramers’ time.

We now turn to situations in which the potential varies slowly in time. For simplicity,

we will consider the family of Ginzburg–Landau potentials

and let either λ or µ vary in time, with low speed ε. For instance, λ or µ may depend
periodically on time, with low frequency 2πε. The potential V has two wells if 27λ2 < 4µ3
and one well if 27λ2 > 4µ3, and when λ or µ are varied, the number of wells may change.
Crossing one of the curves 27λ2 = 4µ3, µ > 0, corresponds to a saddle–node bifurcation,
and crossing the point λ = µ = 0 corresponds to a pitchfork bifurcation.

The slow time-dependence introduces a new time scale Tforcing = 1/ε. Since curvature

and barrier height are no longer constant, we replace the deﬁnitions (1.6) and (1.7) by

Kramers = e2Hmax/σ2

and

For time-dependent potentials, the Fokker–Planck equation (1.3) is even harder to solve
(and in fact, it does not admit a stationary solution). Moreover, random attractors are not
straightforward to deﬁne in this time-dependent setting. We believe that the dynamics
on time scales shorter than T (max)
Kramers is discussed best via an understanding of “typical”
paths. The idea is to show that the vast majority of paths remain concentrated in small
space–time sets, whose shape and size depend on the potential and the noise intensity.
These sets are typically located in a neighbourhood of the potential wells, but under some
conditions paths may also switch potential wells. There are thus two problems to solve:
ﬁrst characterize the sets in which typical paths live, and then estimate the probability of
atypical paths. It turns out that these properties have universal characteristics, depending
only on qualitative properties of the potential, especially its bifurcation points.

We start, in Section 2, by discussing the simplest situation, which occurs when the
initial condition of the process lies in the basin of attraction of a stable equilibrium branch.
For suﬃciently small noise intensity, the majority of paths remain concentrated for a long
time in a neighbourhood of the equilibrium branch. We determine the shape of this
neighbourhood and outline how coloured noise can decrease the spreading of paths.

Section 3 is devoted to the phenomenon of stochastic resonance. We ﬁrst recall the
energy-budget model introduced in [4] to give a possible explanation for the close-to-
periodic appearance of the major Ice Ages. This model is equivalent to the overdamped
motion of a particle in a modulated double-well potential, where the driving amplitude
is too small to allow for transitions between wells in the absence of noise. Turning to
the description of typical paths, we ﬁnd a threshold value for the noise intensity below
which the paths remain in one well, while above threshold, they switch back and forth
between wells twice per period. The switching events occur close to the instants of minimal
barrier height. Several important quantities have a power-law dependence on the small
parameters, in particular the critical noise intensity, the width of transition windows, and
the exponent controlling the exponential decay of the probability of atypical paths.

In Section 4, we start by discussing a variant [11] of Stommel’s box model [34] of
the Atlantic thermohaline circulation. Assuming slow changes in the typical weather,
this model also reduces to the motion in a modulated double-well potential, where the
modulation depends on the freshwater ﬂux. If the amplitude of the modulation exceeds a
threshold, the potential barrier vanishes twice per period, so that the deterministic motion
displays hysteresis. Additive noise inﬂuences the shape of hysteresis cycles, and may even
create macroscopic cycles for subthreshold modulation amplitude. We characterize the
distribution of the random freshwater ﬂux causing the system to switch from one stable
state to the other one.

Finally, in Section 5, we consider the Lorenz model for Rayleigh–B´enard convection
with slowly increasing heating. In the deterministic case, convection rolls appear only some
time after the steady state looses stability in a pitchfork bifurcation. This bifurcation delay
is signiﬁcantly decreased by additive noise, as soon as its intensity is not exponentially
small.

2 Near stable equilibria

Let us start by investigating Equation (1.1) in the one-dimensional case, i. e., when xt,
Wt and G(t) = g(t) are scalar. Since we are interested in the dynamics on the time scale
Tforcing = 1/ε, we rescale time by a factor ε, which results in the SDE

g(t) dWt.

The factor 1/√ε is due to the diﬀusive nature of the Brownian motion.

In this section, we will consider the dynamics near a stable equilibrium branch of f ,

Consider now the SDE (2.1) with positive noise intensity. For the sake of brevity, we

thus lead to a larger spreading of paths. This result holds as long as the spreading is
smaller than the distance between x⋆(t) and the nearest unstable equilibrium (i. e., the
nearest saddle of the potential).

corrections on the time scale Tforcing. Some time dependence of the prefactor is to be
expected, as it reﬂects the fact that occasionally a path will make an unusually large
excursion, and the longer we wait the more excursions we will observe. The prefactor
also depends on ε. A factor 1/ε is due to the fact that we are working on the time scale
Tforcing, while the actual factor of 1/ε2 allows us to obtain the best possible exponent.
Choosing κ slightly smaller allows to replace ε2 by the more natural ε in the deﬁnition

Similar statements are valid in the multidimensional case (in which f does not neces-

In the previous section, we have seen that on a certain time scale, paths typically remain in
metastable equilibrium. With overwhelming probability, they are concentrated in a strip

. This

|

roughly holds as long as the strip does not extend to the nearest saddle of the potential.
New phenomena may occur when this hypothesis is violated, either because the noise
coeﬃcient σg(t) becomes too large, or because the curvature or the distance to the saddle
become too small. Then paths may overcome the potential barrier and reach another
potential well. This mechanism has various interesting consequences, one of them being
the eﬀect called stochastic resonance.

Stochastic resonance (SR) was initially introduced as a possible explanation for the
close-to-periodic appearance of the major Ice Ages [4]. While this explanation remains
controversial, SR has been detected in several other physical and biological systems, see
for instance [29, 39] for a review.

The original model in [4] is based on an energy balance of the Earth in integrated form.
The evolution of the mean surface temperature T is described by the diﬀerential equation

while its period 2π/ω equals 92 000 years. The outgoing radiation Rout = α(T )Rin + E(T )
depends on the albedo α(T ) of the Earth and its emissivity. c denotes the heat capacity.
To account for the existence of two stable climate states (warm climate and Ice Age),
the right-hand side of (3.1) should have two stable and one unstable equilibrium points.

The term in brackets in (3.5) derives from a double-well potential, which is almost of the
Ginzburg–Landau type (1.8). If we set, for simplicity, x1 =
1 and x3 = 1, and neglect the
term A cos 2πt, then we obtain indeed a force deriving from the potential (1.8), with µ = 1
0.38,
and λ = K cos 2πt. This potential has two wells if and only if
and thus the amplitude K of the forcing is too small to enable transitions between the
potential wells. Note, however, that although A is very small, K is not negligible compared
to λc.

term in (3.8). For cos(2πt) = 0, the potential is symmetric (middle), for integer times, the
left-hand well approaches the saddle (right), while for half-integer times, the right-hand
well approaches the saddle (left). If the amplitude K is smaller than the threshold λc,
there is always a potential barrier, which an overdamped particle cannot overcome in the
deterministic case. Suﬃciently strong noise, however, helps the particle to switch from the
shallower to the deeper well. This eﬀect is the stronger the lower the barrier is, so that
switching typically occurs close to the instants of minimal barrier height.

Pathwise analysis of slow ly driven Langevin equations

Metastability in simple climate models:

The main new idea in [4] is that if one models the eﬀect of the “weather” by an additive
noise term, then transitions between potential wells not only become possible but, due to
the periodic forcing, these transitions will be more likely at some times than at others, so
that the evolution of T can be close to periodic. We will illustrate this on the model SDE

However, the results in [7] apply to a more general class of periodically forced double-well
potentials, including (3.5).

Various characterizations of the eﬀect of noise on the dynamics of (3.8), and various
measures of periodicity have been proposed. A widespread approach uses the signal-to-
noise ratio, a property of the power spectrum of xt, which shows peaks near multiples of
the driving frequency [16, 27, 24]. For small driving amplitudes K, the signal-to-noise ratio
/σ4, where H is the height of the potential barrier in the absence of

periodic driving (i. e., for K = 0). The signal’s “periodicity” is thus optimal for σ2 = H/2.
A diﬀerent approach is used in [17], where the Lp-distance between sample paths and a

periodic limiting function is shown to converge to zero in probability as σ
requires ε to be of order e−

, which implies exponentially long forcing periods.

We examine here a diﬀerent regime, in which the forcing amplitude K is not necessarily
a small parameter, but may approach λc.
In this way, transitions become possible for
values of ε which are not exponentially small. The potential barrier is lowest at integer
and half-integer times. At integer times, the left-hand well approaches the saddle, while
at half-integer times, the right-hand well approaches the saddle, c. f. Figure 2.

The minimal values Hmin, cmin and δmin of the barrier height, the curvature at the
bottom of the wells, and the distance between the bottom of one of the wells and the
saddle can be expressed as functions of a parameter a0 = λc −
K. For small a0, they

Note the similarity with Kramers’ time for the potential frozen at the moment of minimal
barrier height.

A bound of this form can indeed be proved, but (3.9) turns out to be a little bit
too pessimistic for very small a0. This is a rather subtle dynamical eﬀect, related to the
behaviour of the deterministic system. Recall that the set
(h) in (2.7) is deﬁned via

well. This distinction is irrelevant as long as the minimal curvature remains of order one,
but not when it is a small parameter. In that case, the asymptotic expansion (2.3) does
not necessarily converge. Using methods from singular perturbation theory [10], one can
show that ¯xdet
never approaches the saddle closer than a distance of order √ε, so that the
curvature at ¯xdet
never becomes smaller than a quantity of order √ε, even if a0 < ε. As a
consequence, for a0 < ε, the system behaves as if there were an eﬀective potential barrier
of height ε3/2.

During this time interval, the process xt makes a certain number of attempts to over-

the right-hand well, in which case it will make further attempts to cross the barrier, or to
fall into the deeper left-hand well, where it is likely to stay during the next half-period.
One can show that the typical time for each excursion is of order ε/c(t). Although the
diﬀerent attempts are not independent, the probability not to reach the left-hand well

transition window so that paths might also make excursions away from the saddle.

well. Ampliﬁcation by SR is thus optimal for noise intensities just above the threshold σc,
because stronger noise intensities will gradually blur the signal.

In the large-noise regime σ > σc, the vast majority of paths stay in a strip switching
back and forth between potential wells each time the barrier height becomes minimal, as
shown in Figure 3.

Paths spend approximately half the time (for 1/4 < t < 1/2, 3/4 < t < 1, and so on)
in metastable equilibrium in the shallower potential well. This diﬀers from the quasistatic
picture, when the driving period is larger than the maximal Kramers time, and paths
spend most of the time in the deeper potential well with occasional excursions to the
shallower one.

While the details of the transition process depend on the potential, the exponents
in (3.10) and (3.11) depend only on qualitative properties of the avoided bifurcation.
Other exponents arise, for instance, if V is a symmetric potential with modulated barrier
height of the form (1.8) with λ = 0 and µ(t) = a0 + 1
cos 2πt, c. f. [8, Theorem 3.2].
Here an additional feature can be observed: For suﬃciently strong noise, the process is
likely to reach the saddle during a certain transition window, but due to symmetry, it
has about equal probability to be in either of the wells when transitions become unlikely
again. Observing the process for several periods, we see that near the instants of minimal

exponentially close to 1/2 for choosing either.

c = (a0 ∨

One can also consider the eﬀect of coloured noise on SR. If the system is driven by
an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process with damping γ, the typical spreading of paths will be
smaller, making transitions more diﬃcult. One can show that transitions only become
likely above a threshold noise intensity σc, given by

It is, of course, not easy to decide whether the observed periodicity in the appearance
of Ice Ages can be explained by a simple, one-dimensional SDE of the form (3.8). Our
results show, however, that in order to match the observations, the noise intensity should
lie in a relatively narrow interval. Too weak noise will not allow regular transitions between
stable states, while too strong noise increases the width of the transition windows so much
that although switching does occur, no periodicity can be observed.

4 Hysteresis

The glacial cycle is not the only important bistable system in climate physics. Another
wellknown example is the Atlantic thermohaline circulation. At present time, the Gulf
Stream transports enormous amounts of heat from the Tropics as far north as the Barents
Sea, causing the current mild climate in Western Europe. It is believed, however, that this
has not always been the case in the past, and that during long time spans, the thermohaline
circulation was locked in a stable state with far less heat transported to the North (see
for instance [30]).

A simple model for oceanic circulation showing bistability is Stommel’s box model [34],
where the ocean is represented by two boxes, a low-latitude box with temperature T1 and
salinity S1, and a high-latitude box with temperature T2 and salinity S2. Here we will
follow the presentation in [11], where the intrinsic dynamics of salinity and of temperature

As we know from the previous section, for K < λc, there is an amplitude-dependent
threshold noise level σc such that during one period, xt is unlikely to cross the potential
barrier for σ
σc. In fact, in the latter case, there
is a large probability to cross the barrier a time of order σ2/3 before the instant t = 1/2
σ4/3. In that case, the hysteresis cycle
of minimal barrier height, when λ is of order λc −
will be smaller than the static cycle. A similar distinction between a small-noise and a

The probability to observe a “macroscopic” hysteresis cycle is very small, as most
paths are concentrated in a small neighbourhood of the bottom of the right-hand
potential well (Figure 5a).
Case II – Large-amplitude regime: a0 > const ε and σ 6 (ε√a0 )1/2.
This regime is actually the most diﬃcult to study, since the deterministic solution

jumps when
the left-hand potential well. One can show, however, that
is concentrated in an
interval of length of order (ε√a0 )2/3 around the deterministic value [9, Theorem 2.4].

In some physical applications, for instance in ferromagnets, the area enclosed by hys-
teresis cycles represents the energy dissipation per period. The distribution of the random
hysteresis area can also be described, and bounds on its expectation and variance can be
obtained. We refer to [9] and [8, Section 4] for details.

For Stommel’s box model, the above properties have two important consequences.
First, noise can drive the system from one stable equilibrium to the other before the
potential barrier between them disappears, so that a smaller deviation from the mean
freshwater ﬂux than expected from the deterministic analysis can switch the system’s
state. Second, this early switching to the other state is likely only if the noise intensity
exceeds a threshold value (which is lowest when the amplitude K is close to λc). Still,
the system spends roughly half of the time per period in metastable equilibrium in the
shallower well.

5 Delay

Convective motions in the atmosphere can be simulated in a laboratory experiment known
as Rayleigh–B´enard convection. A ﬂuid contained between two horizontal plates is heated
from below. For low heating, the ﬂuid remains at rest. Above a threshold, stationary
convection rolls develop. With increasing energy supply, the angular velocity of the rolls
becomes time-dependent, ﬁrst periodically, and then, after a sequence of bifurcations de-
pending on the geometry of the set-up, chaotic. For still stronger heating, the convection
rolls are destroyed and the dynamics becomes turbulent.

Lorenz’ famous model [26] uses a three-modes Galerkin approximation of the hydro-

dynamic equations. The amplitudes of these modes obey the ODEs

(5.1)

Here X measures the angular velocity of convection rolls, while Y and Z parametrize the
temperature ﬁeld. The Prandtl number Pr > 0 is a characteristic of the ﬂuid, b depends
on the geometry of the container, and r is proportional to the heating.

For 0 6 r 6 1, the origin (X, Y, Z) = (0, 0, 0) is a global attractor of the system,
corresponding to the ﬂuid at rest. At r = 1, this state becomes unstable in a pitchfork

created, which correspond to convection rolls with the two possible directions of rotation.
We will focus on this simplest bifurcation, ignoring all the other sequences of bifurcations

We are interested in the situation where r = r(εt) grows monotonously through r(0) =

to an invariant center manifold, on which the dynamics is governed (c. f. [10]), after scaling

from a potential similar to the Ginzburg–Landau potential (1.8) with λ = 0, which remains
symmetric while transforming from a single-well to a double-well as µ(t) becomes positive,
see Figure 7.

The solution of (5.2) with initial condition x0 > 0 for t0 < 0 can be written in the

form

xt = ϕ(x0, t) eα(t,t0)/ε,

with 0 < ϕ(x0, t) 6 x0 for all t. Thus xt is exponentially small if α(t, t0) is negative. The
important point to note is that α(t, t0) can be negative even when a(t) is positive. For
instance, if µ(s) = s, then α(t, t0) = 1
t0. Thus xt
will remain exponentially close to the saddle at x = 0 up to time
t0 after crossing the
bifurcation point. This phenomenon is called bifurcation delay. It means that when r is
slowly increased, convection rolls will not appear at r = 1, as expected from the static
analysis, but only for some larger value of r, which depends on the initial condition.

It is clear that the existence of a delay depends crucially on the fact that xt can
approach the saddle exponentially closely, where the repulsion is very small. Noise present
in the system will help kicking xt away from the saddle, and thus reduce the delay. The
question is to determine how the delay depends on the noise intensity σ.

Once xt has left

(̺). Then, for
that xt leaves

the same point at time τ , approaches the bottom of the well at

and others the right-hand well (with probability exponentially close to 1/2 in Regime II),
but all the paths which choose a given potential well are unlikely to cross the barrier again.
In fact, one can show that if µ(t) grows at least linearly, then the probability ever to cross
. If we start the system at a positive t0 in one of the
the saddle again is of order e−
wells, the distribution will never approach a symmetric bimodal one.

In the case of the Rayleigh–B´enard convection with slowly growing heat supply r(εt)
and additive noise, these results mean that exponentially weak noise will not prevent the
delayed appearance of convection rolls. For moderate noise intensity, rolls will appear

after a delay of order

deterministic case which is of order 1/ε. The direction of rotation is unlikely to change
after another time span of that order. For strong noise, convection rolls may appear early,
but their angular velocity will ﬂuctuate around zero until a time of order σ/ε after the
bifurcation before settling for a sign, and even then occasional changes of rotation direction
are possible.

In this paper a real option approah for the valuation of real assets is

presented. Two ontinuous time models used for valuation are desribed:

geometri Brownian motion model and interest rate model. The valuation

for eletriity spread option under Vasiek interest model is plaed and the

formulas for parameter estimators are alulated. The theoretial part is

onfronted with real data from eletriity market.

1. Introdution

The liberalization of eletriity market aused that modeling on this mar-

ket beame very important skill. It helps us to minimize loss and hedge our

position. It is a very interesting fat that spread option ould be used for

valuation some real assets as power plants or transmission lines. But before

that we need to know the spread option prie formula. Very popular model

used for option valuation is the geometri Brownian motion model but it

is not very e(cid:30)ient.

In the 2005 the idea of modeling domesti eletri-

ity market using interest rate model was introdued by Hinz, Grafenstein,

Vershue and Wilhelm [1℄. They valuated European all option written on

power forward ontrat under Heath Jarrow Morton model and, in this way,

reated very interesting lass of models.

The aim of my work is the valuation and alibration of eletriity spread

option under interest rate model applied for eletriity market. I start with

assumption of Vasiek model and using martingale methodology [2℄ valu-

ate spread option. Using the maximum likelihood funtion methodology I

estimate model parameters. I ompare onstruted model with geometri

Brownian motion model by applying both models to real option valuation.

I make simulations to show the di(cid:27)erene between to disussed models.

My paper is organized in the following way. At the beginning (Setion 2)

I desribe what does it mean that we bought a spread option, next (Setion

3) I introdue the reader into real options world. In Setion 4 I desribe val-

uation methodology for spread option under interest rate model and present

also option prie formula for geometri Brownian motion model. The al-

ibration methods for both models are desribed in Setion 5. At the end,

in Setion 6, all theoretial deliberation are onfronted with real data and

some simulation results are presented.

2. Eletriity Spread Options

In this setion two interesting ross ommodity derivatives on eletriity

market are desribed. The (cid:28)rst one is the spark spread option, whih is based

on fat that some power plants onvert gas into eletriity. The underlying

instrument is the di(cid:27)erene between the gas and eletriity pries (the spark

spread). The basi parameter onneted with this kind of instrument is the

heat rate, the ratio whih desribes the amount of gas required to generate

1 MWh of eletriity. The de(cid:28)nition of suh an instrument has a form [3, 4℄:

An European spark spread all option written on fuel F , at (cid:28)xed swap ratio
K , gives its holder the right, but not the obligation to pay K times the unit
prie of fuel F at the options maturity T and reeive the prie of one unit

of eletriity.

It is easy to imagine suh kind of option whih better (cid:28)ts the Polish

eletriity market. We should assume that the underlying instrument is the

di(cid:27)erene between the arbon and eletriity pries. But in this time there

is no possibility of valuation of suh an option beause we don't have the

representative arbon prie. Generally, if we assume that PE and PF are

respetively future prie of 1MWh of eletriity and the future prie of the

unit of fuel and K is the swap ratio than we ould desribe the payo(cid:27) of the

European eletriity-fuel spread all option as

CF (PE , PF , T ) = max[PE(T )

KPF (T ), 0]

and the payo(cid:27) of the European eletriity-fuel spread put option has form

PF (PE, PF , T ) = max[KPF (T )

PE(T ), 0]

The seond derivative is the loational spread option.

It is based on

fat that transmission of power from one loation to another is very popular

transation. It is normal, for transmission system, that the power is moved

from the plae of lower prie to the plae of higher prie and this is why the

transation is pro(cid:28)table. The whole transation depends on the di(cid:27)erene

between the eletriity pries and also on delivery osts and for hedging we

EBS printed on January 8, 2014

ould use options. This kind of instrument ould be de(cid:28)ned in following way

[3℄: An European all option on the loational spread between the loation

one and loation two, with maturity T , gives its holder the right but not the

obligation to pay the prie of one unit of eletriity at loation one at time T

and reeive the prie of K units of eletriity at loation two. Assume that
P1 and P2 are the eletriity pries at the (cid:28)rst loation and seond loation

respetively. The payo(cid:27) of the European loational spread all option is

given by

CL(P1, P2, T ) = max[P1(T )

KP2(T ), 0]

The put option is de(cid:28)ned similar and the payo(cid:27) of the European eletriity-

fuel spread put option has form

PL(P1, P2, T ) = max[KP2(T )

P1(T ), 0]

Suppose that for desribing the ommodity we use three qualities (G, t, L):

3. Real Options

G - the nature of good, t - time when it is available, L - loation where it

is available. We ould de(cid:28)ne [5℄ a real option as tehnology to physially

onvert one or more input ommodities (G, t, L) into an output ommodity
(G′, t′, L′). For example most of power plants are real option beause they

give us the right to onvert fuel into eletriity. The transmission line is also

real option. It gives us the right to hange the eletriity in one loation into

eletriity in seond loation. The works of Deng, Johnson and Sogomonian

[6, 3℄ ontain two formulas de(cid:28)ning how to valuate generation and transmis-

sion assets. If we de(cid:28)ne that uF (t) is a one unit of the time-t right to use

generation asset we ould say that it is the value of just maturing, time-t

all option on the spread between eletriity and fuel pries CF (t) and the
one unit value of apaity of power plant using some fuel F is given by

where T is the length of power plant life.

Similar if we de(cid:28)ne that uAB

L (t) is a one unit the time-t right to onvert

one unit of eletriity in loation A into one unit of eletriity in loation B

we ould say that it is the value of just maturing,time-t all option on the

spread between eletriity pries in loation A and B C AB

L (t). The one unit

value of suh transmission asset is given by

4. Valuation methods

In this setion I present the widely known geometri Brownian motion

model and I valuate the all spread option for the new, interest rate model

using martingale methodology. All alulations are desribed below.

4.1. Geometri Brownian Motion Model

Suppose that the future pries of ommodity are desribed by following

stohasti di(cid:27)erential equations

dP1(t, T ) = µ1P1(t, T )dt + σ1P1(t, T )dWt,1,

dP2(t, T ) = µ2P2(t, T )dt + σ2P2(t, T )dWt,2,

where Wt,1 = ρWt,2 +

′

ρ2W

t,2 and Wt,2 , W

′
t,2 are i.i.d. Brownian mo-

tions. It is known fat [5℄, that the prie of the spread all option with swap

ratio K and time to maturity T , written on futures ontrat with maturity
U < T is given by

4.2. Interest Rate Model

For domesti urreny, for example MWh, we denote two proesses:

p1(t, T ), p2(t, T ) whih are the future pries of one unit of ommodity. The

interest rate funtions for suh proesses are respetively

drt,1 = (a1 −

b1rt,1)dt + σ1dWt,1

and

drt,2 = (a2 −

b2rt,2)dt + σ2dWt,2,

′
where Wt,1 = ρWt,2 +
t,2 are i.i.d. Brownian mo-
tions. We assume that there exist the savings seurity Nt (for example in
p
USD), with onstant interest rate r , for whih

t,2 and Wt,2 , W

that there exist a martingale measure P for whih the disounted proesses
p1(t,T )

We de(cid:28)ne the new disounting proesses for i=1,2 as

where B0,i = 1. If we hange the measure from P to P1

dBt,i = Bt,irt,idt,

dP
dP1

=

NT B0,1
N0BT,1

we know that proesses ˜p1(t, T ) = p1(t,T )

Bt,1 , ˜p2(t, T ) = p2(t,T )

Bt,1 are P1 -martingales.

From interest rate theory we obtain

d ˜p1(t, T ) = ˜p1(t, T )n1(t, T )dWt,1,

where

n1(t, T ) =

If we hange the measure again from P1 to P2

=

BT,1B0,2
B0,1BT,2

we know that ˆp2(t, T ) = p2(t,T )
Bt,2

and ˆp1(t, T ) = p1(t,T )

Bt,2 = ˜p1(t,T )Bt,1

Bt,2

are P2 -

martingales and similar to the earlier situation, we have

d ˆp2(t, T ) = ˆp2(t, T )n2(t, T )dWt,2,

where

n2(t, T ) =

After simple alulations we also have

where

˜Wt,1 = ρWt,2 +

Having the neessary stohasti di(cid:27)erential equations we ould prie the

option. We hange the measure from P2 to Q in following way

BT,2p2(0, U )

dP2
dQ
p2(t,T ) = ˆp1(t,T )

Proess X(t, T ) = p1(t,T )

ˆp2(t,T ) is Q-martingale. From Ito lemma we

know that

dX(t, T ) = X(t, T )(n1(t, T )d ˆWt,1 −
ˆWt,2 = ˜W

ρ2 ˆWt,2 and

This methodology ould be used diretly for loational spread options and

also for fuel-eletriity spread options if we assume that the swap ratio be-

5. Historial Calibration

In this setion we desribe how to (cid:28)t our models for real, historial data.

At the beginning we assume that we are given historial pries of future

ontrats P1(tk, Tj) and P2(tk, Tj), k = 0, . . . , n, j = 0, . . . , m, in disrete
tk = dt
time points t0 < t1 < . . . < tn and T0 < T1 < . . . < Tm , where tk+1 −
and Tj+1 −

Tj = ∆T .

For geometri Brownian motion model the alibration methodology is

not very ompliated. We analyze the returns of future pries of instrument

and µ is its mean, σ2

is its variane and orrelation parameter is simply the

orrelation between returns of two instruments. But for interest rate model

the alibration is quite ompliated, espeially for multidimensional HJM

model [7℄. Calibration for disussed Vasiek model is presented below.

Let us onsider following proess

ηi(t, Tj) =

ˆpi(t, Tj)
ˆpi(t, Tj+1)

=

Pi(t, Tj)
Pi(t, Tj+1)

.

From It lemma we know that

dηi(t, Tj) = ηi(t, Tj)[(n2

i (t, Tj+1)

ni(t, Tj+1)ni(t, Tj))dt+

−

We ould write that ni(t, T ) = ni(T
t) beause this funtion depends only
−
from the di(cid:27)erene between the maturity time T and the time point t. If we

then onsider the proess

si(T

Knowing the form of funtions ni(T

After disretisation and for assumption that dt = ∆T = 1, T
and j = 1, . . . , m we ould say that the estimator of β has the form

−

t = p∆T

(p∆T ) =

Pi(Tj −(p+1)∆T,Tj+∆T )

6. Simulation and Conlusion

For simulation I used data from New York Merantile Exhange (NYMEX).

I onsidered historial quotation of future natural gas (Henry Hub) and

eletriity (PJM) ontrats sine January, 2004 until Marh, 2006. The pa-

rameters were alulated using alibration methods desribed before. All

estimated parameters are presented in Table 6. I assumed that the onstant

interest rate is r = 0.05. For valuation of gas (cid:28)red power plant I assumed
that the life-time of the power plant is T = 15 years and PE,0 = 55.750
USD, PF,0 = 6.3080 USD.

In Figure 1. we see the value of power plant for the heat rate ranging from

5 to 15 for both presented models. We ould notie that there is di(cid:27)erene in

hanges dynami for analyzed models. The value of power plant for interest

rate model is muh more smaller than for GBM model and it tends to zero

when the heat rate goes up. It is a very good feature, beause in reality the

under GBM model is usually too high, so also in this aspet the interest rate

model gives better results.

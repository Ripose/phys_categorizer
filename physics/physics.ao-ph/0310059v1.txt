Comparing the ensemble mean and the ensemble standard
deviation as inputs for probabilistic medium-range temperature
forecasts

Abstract

We ask the following question: what are the relative contributions of the ensemble mean and the
ensemble standard deviation to the skill of a site-speciﬁc probabilistic temperature forecast? Is it the
case that most of the beneﬁt of using an ensemble forecast to predict temperatures comes from the
ensemble mean, or from the ensemble spread, or is the beneﬁt derived equally from the two? The
answer is that one of the two is much more useful than the other.

1 Introduction

We consider medium range probabilistic site-speciﬁc forecasts of temperatures. There are a number of
methods that can be used to produce such forecasts. These methods diﬀer in terms of a) the underlying
numerical forecast model, b) the predictors that are taken from the forecast model and c) the statistical
methods used to transform these predictors into predictions. For instance, the underlying model could be
the ECMWF or the NCEP model (inter alia); the underlying predictors could be the ensemble mean and
the standard deviation or just the ensemble mean (inter alia) and the statistical transform used could
be based on the rank histogram or spread regression (inter alia).
Much work has gone into trying to understand the sources of medium range forecast skill, and to improve
medium range forecasts. Some of this has aimed at determining which of the various numerical models
produce the best predictors (point ”a” above). There has also been some investigation into which of the
various statistical transforms are the most appropriate (point ”c” above). We will now address a third
question but closely related question: what is the relative importance of the diﬀerent predictors that
can be derived from the numerical models (point ”b” above). In particular, we will consider the relative
importance of the mean and the standard deviation of ensemble forecast temperatures, when used to
make a site-speciﬁc probabilistic forecast. We consider only the mean and the standard deviation, rather
than all the individual ensemble members, since, for the dataset we will use, it has been shown by Jewson
(2003b) that there seems to be no useful information in the ensemble beyond the mean and the spread.
The statistical models we use to address this question are all derived from the spread regression model
of Jewson et al. (2003). This model takes the mean and the standard deviation from an ensemble forecast
and converts them into a probabilistic forecast. This model is particularly useful for addressing the
question of relative importance of the diﬀerent predictors since it allows us to turn each of them on and
oﬀ rather easily.
We do not think that it is a priori obvious which of the ensemble mean and ensemble spread are more
useful for making a probabilistic forecast. For instance, one can imagine dynamical systems for which
the expectation varies very little, but for which the uncertainty varies a lot. Similarly one can imagine
dynamical systems for which the expectation varies a lot, but for which the uncertainty varies little. In the
ﬁrst of these it is likely that forecasts of the expectation are more important, while in the latter it is likely
that forecasts of the uncertainty would be more important. We see, therefore, that our question is, in
part, a question about the dynamics of the atmosphere. One can also imagine a particular forecast system
that, for whatever reason, does very well in predicting the expectation, but very poorly in predicting the
uncertainty, or vice versa. From this we see that our question is also a question about speciﬁc forecast
systems.

In section 2 we describe the data we use for this study. In section 3 we describe the methodology and the
statistical models we will use to address this question. In section 4 we present the results of our analysis
and in section 5 we discuss the implications.

2 Data

We will base our analyses on one year of ensemble forecast data for the weather station at London’s
Heathrow airport, WMO number 03772. The forecasts are predictions of the daily average temperature,
and the target days of the forecasts run from 1st January 2002 to 31st December 2002. The forecast was
produced from the ECMWF model (Molteni et al., 1996) and downscaled to the airport location using
a simple interpolation routine prior to our analysis. There are 51 members in the ensemble. We will
compare these forecasts to the quality controlled climate values of daily average temperature for the same
location as reported by the UKMO.
There is no guarantee that the forecast system was held constant throughout this period, and as a result
there is no guarantee that the forecasts are in any sense stationary, quite apart from issues of seasonality.
This is clearly far from ideal with respect to our attempts to build statistical interpretation models on
past forecast data but is, however, unavoidable: this is the data we have to work with.
Throughout this paper all equations and all values are in terms of double anomalies (have had both the
seasonal mean and the seasonal standard deviation removed). Removing the seasonal standard deviation
removes most of the seasonality in the forecast error statistics, and partly justiﬁes the use of non-seasonal
parameters in the statistical models for temperature that we propose.

3 Models

We will address the question of whether the useful information in ensemble forecasts comes to a greater
extent from the ensemble mean or from the ensemble spread by considering the site-speciﬁc forecasts for
temperature at London Heathrow described above. Our forecasts are produced by four ensemble interpre-
tation models, which is the name we give to the statistical models that take the non-probabilistic predictors
from the ensemble forecasts and convert them into probability density functions for the predicted tem-
peratures. Such models are essential if one wants to produce probability forecasts from ensemble output.
The models we choose are ideally suited for answering the question at hand because they allow us to turn
on and oﬀ the various sources of information in the ensemble very easily and see what impact that has
on the skill of the resulting forecast.
The simplest model we consider consists of the use of linear regression between a single member of the
ensemble and the observed temperature. The regression model serves to correct biases, to adjust the
amplitude of the variability, and to predict the uncertainty. We will write this model as:

Ti ∼ N (α + βxi, γ)

where Ti is the double anomaly temperature on day i and xi is the ensemble member on day i. The skill
of this model gives an indication of the ability of single integrations of the numerical model to predict
the distribution of future atmospheric states. It is a baseline that the ensemble forecast should beat if it
has any value.
Our second model is the same as the ﬁrst, but the predictor is the ensemble mean, rather than a single
ensemble member. We write this model as:

where mi is the ensemble mean on day i. This model should hopefully perform better than the ﬁrst
model.
Our third model is an extension of the ﬁrst model to include the ensemble standard deviation as a
predictor of the uncertainty:

Ti ∼ N (α + βmi, γ)

Ti ∼ N (α + βxi, γ + δsi)

where si is the ensemble standard deviation.
Finally our fourth model combines the second and the third models by using the ensemble mean as a
predictor for the temperature, and the ensemble standard deviation as a predictor for the uncertainty
around the temperature. This is the spread regression model of Jewson et al. (2003).

These models have been designed to allow us to answer the question at hand. For instance, comparison
of the results from model one and model two, or between model three and model four, gives the beneﬁt
of using the ensemble mean versus a single integration. Comparison between model one and model three,
or between model two and model four, gives the beneﬁt of using the ensemble spread versus only using
past forecast error statistics.
We ﬁt all of these models using the standard maximum likelihood method from classical statistics. More
details of this method as applied to this problem are given in Jewson (2003c).

3.1 Scoring the models

In order to compare the results from our four models we need a measure for how good the resulting
probabilistic forecast is. To our knowledge only two scores have been suggested in the literature for
comparing continuous probabilistic forecasts: the ”ignorance” by Roulston and Smith (2002), and the
likelihood, by Jewson et al. (2003). It turns out that these two are, for this case, more or less the same
thing. We will therefore use this score to compare our forecasts, in the form of the log-likelihood.

4 Results

4.1 Parameter values

We ﬁrst look at the parameter values for our various statistical models. Figure 1 shows the values of
alpha for the four models. The two models that are based on the single ensemble member have very
similar values of alpha, while the two models that are based on the ensemble mean also have similar
values. The values from the models based on the single ensemble member are somewhat smaller.
Figure 2 shows the values of beta for the four models. The values from the four models pair up in the
same way as for the values of alpha, with the values for the single model based forecasts being much
lower than the values for the ensemble mean based forecasts.
We can understand these values of beta as follows. We can consider a single integration of the numerical
model to consist of the ensemble mean plus a noise term. The noise terms are at least somewhat diﬀerent
for the diﬀerent members of the ensemble. Thus, in forming the ensemble mean the noise terms tend to
cancel out and the overall noise is smaller. When we regress a single member onto observed temperatures,
the regression coeﬃcient is rather small because of the large noise term. When we regress the ensemble
mean onto observed temperatures, the regression coeﬃcient is much larger, because the noise level is
lower. The mathematics of this eﬀect have been given in detail by Jewson and Ziehmann (2002).
The value of alpha can be understood in terms of the values of beta. Alpha arises due to a combination
of bias, and the beta term. We would expect the bias to be the same for a single ensemble member and
the ensemble mean: the diﬀerences we see can be explained as being due to the diﬀerences in the beta.
Figure 3 shows the values of gamma for the four models. Because gamma plays a slightly diﬀerent role
in the diﬀerent models, there is no single physical interpretation of what it means. In the two regression
models gamma represents the uncertainty: we see that the uncertainty is greater in the model that
only uses the single ensemble member, as would be expected. In the spread regression models, gamma
represents only a part of the total uncertainty, and can only be interpreted in combination with delta,
which is shown in ﬁgure 4. Conﬁdence intervals for the value of delta in the spread regression model
are given by Jewson et al. (2003), and show that there is signiﬁcant sampling uncertainty about these
estimates. This is not surprising since delta is related to the second moment of the second moment of
observed temperatures. This sampling uncertainty is reﬂected in ﬁgure 4 by the jaggedness of the lines.
Nevertheless we can see a general trend towards lower values of delta at high leads for both models.

4.2 Total Uncertainty

Comparing the gamma and delta parameter values for the four statistical models is somewhat dissatis-
factory since, as we have seen, gamma does not have consistent interpretation across the four models. It
makes more sense to compare the total uncertainty predicted by the four models. In ﬁgures 5 and ﬁgure 6
we compare the mean and the standard deviation of this predicted uncertainty respectively. In ﬁgure 5
we see that the two models based on the ensemble mean have much lower mean uncertainty than the two
models based on the single integration, as would be expected. The ensemble mean gives signiﬁcantly bet-
ter forecasts than individual ensemble members, especially at longer leads. Figure 6 shows the variability

in the predicted uncertainty for the two spread regression models. The two regression models, both of
which ignore the ensemble spread, are not shown because they predict constant levels of uncertainty. We
see that the two spread regression models predict roughly the same levels of variability in the uncertainty.
There are some diﬀerences between the two, but we suspect these diﬀerences are mostly due to sampling
error.

4.3 Likelihood scores

Finally we come to the results that answer the question that we set out to address: what are the relative
contributions of the ensemble mean and the ensemble standard deviation to the skill of the ﬁnal forecast?
We present the comparisons in terms of the negative of the log-likehood, for which small values represent
a good forecast. We compare the models in pairs to isolate individual eﬀects, as described in section 3.
Figure 7, top left panel, shows a comparison between models one and two. This comparison is designed
to illustrate the beneﬁt of using the ensemble mean over using a single ensemble member. We see a very
large beneﬁt at all lead times. For instance, the ensemble mean based forecast at lead 6 is roughly as
good as the single member based forecast at lead 4. We are left in no doubt that use of the ensemble
mean is very beneﬁcial for our probabilistic forecast. The lower left panel shows a comparison between
models three and four. This comparison also shows the beneﬁt of using the ensemble mean over using
a single ensemble member, but now for the models that also use the ensemble spread. The size of the
beneﬁt is roughly the same as before.
The right hand panels show the eﬀects of using the ensemble spread. The top right panel shows the
beneﬁt of using the ensemble spread in the models that do not use the ensemble mean, and the lower
right panel shows the beneﬁt of using the ensemble spread in the models that do use the ensemble mean.
The results are roughly the same:
in both cases we see only a very marginal beneﬁt from using the
ensemble spread.
Figure 8 now shows the diﬀerences that we see in the beneﬁt due to the ensemble mean and the ensemble
spread. There are a number of ways one could try and quantify this eﬀect: we choose to look at the
numerical diﬀerences in the log-likelihood. The top left hand panel shows the diﬀerences in the log-
likelihood caused by the use of the ensemble mean as a predictor (from comparing models 1 and 2).
The values lie between 10 and 70. The top right hand panel shows the diﬀerences in the log-likelihood
caused by the use of the ensemble spread as a predictor (from comparing models 2 and 4). The values lie
between zero and 10. The lower panels show the ratios of these log-likelihood diﬀerences, which quantify
how much more useful the ensemble mean is as a predictor than the ensemble spread. We see the values
for this ratio lie between four and 100, and increase at longer lead times. The ensemble spread is relatively
most useful at the shortest lead times, while the ensemble mean is relatively most useful at the longest
lead times.

5 Discussion

We have investigated the relative contributions of the ensemble mean and the ensemble standard deviation
to the skill of probabilistic temperature forecasts. This was done by using four diﬀerent statistical models
to produce the probabilistic forecasts. These models diﬀer in terms of whether they use the ensemble
mean or a single ensemble member, and whether they use the ensemble spread or predict uncertainty
purely using past forecast error statistics.
The results are very clear: we see that the ensemble mean is much more important than the ensemble
spread. The diﬀerence is least at short leads, where the ensemble mean is only about four times as
useful as the ensemble spread (using the particular measure that we have chosen). At medium leads the
ensemble mean is between 10 and 20 times as useful as the ensemble spread, and at the longest lead the
ensemble mean is roughly 100 times more useful than the ensemble spread.
There are a number of caveats to this study. In particular, we have only used data from one station.
Diﬀerent results would probably be obtained at other stations. We have also only used one year of
forecast data, and we have seen that this leads to rather noisy estimates for some of our parameters. Our
estimates would be more accurate if we had more data, as long as that data were stationary. Having said
that, our main result, which is that the ensemble mean is much more useful than the ensemble standard
deviation, seems to be so clear that we doubt whether it would change even if we did repeat this analysis
for a number of other stations and with more data.
Finally, we note that have performed all of our analysis in-sample. This is not ideal: if possible, out of
sample results are to be preferred. However, Jewson (2003a) has shown that out of sample one cannot
detect any beneﬁcial eﬀects of ensemble spread whatsoever using this data-set, and so it would not be

possible to perform this study if we were to do it out of sample. By using an in-sample analysis, and
using statistical models with small numbers of parameters to minimize overﬁtting and artiﬁcial skill, we
have been able to shed light on a question that could not be otherwise addressed.

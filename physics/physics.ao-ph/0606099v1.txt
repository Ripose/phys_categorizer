Introduction

The Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), such as the American Global
Positioning System (GPS), the Russian GLONASS, or the future European
Galileo, are constellations of satellites transmitting coded signals at L-band. In
addition to the standard use of these signals for navigation and positioning pur-
poses, they have also been widely used for geophysical studies (geodesy, crust
and tectonics, seismics, post glacial rebound) and in radio sounding techniques
along the occulting geometry (GPS-MET, Champ, Grace, SAC-C). Similarly,
the potential use of these signals of opportunity as bi-static radar has arisen the
interest of the scientiﬁc community because of its rich coverage (more than 50
GNSS satellites will be transmitting in a few years from now). The concept,
also known as PAssive Reﬂectometry and Interferometric System (PARIS, [1]),
aims to use the signals after their reﬂection oﬀ of the Earth surface. Many ex-
periments have been conducted to assess the possibilities and Geo-information
extraction techniques of the GNSS reﬂected signals, mostly focused on retrieval
of soil moisture, ice characterization, and preeminently, oceanographic parame-
ters.

The GNSS signals reﬂected on the sea surface have been proven sensitive
to part of the sea roughness spectra (L-band roughness, for instance [2]), and
mean sea level determination (airborne altimetry at 5-cm precision level [3]).
The roughness at L-band could be relevant to air-sea interaction modelling,
or for complementing and helping understanding other L-band remote sensing
missions such as the ocean salinity mode of the SMOS instrument. The synergies
with SMOS-like missions are currently being assessed within the CoSMOS-OS
experimental campaign [4].

The purpose of this work is to present a geophysical product potentially
inferable out of GNSS reﬂected signals: the dielectric properties of the sea
surface, i.e. a combination of salinity and temperature. We present a new
technique to achieve it, and study the feasibility of the concept in terms of its
dynamical range and the real error budget, required system improvements, and
open questions.

1.2 POPI: POlarimetric Phase Interferometry

This Section presents a novel technique which aims to use the polarimetric re-
sponse of the sea surface interface at L-band to infer its dielectric properties. The
approach uses the phase information at two circular polarizations. The
GPS signals are emitted at Right Hand Circular Polarization (RHCP), which
mostly turns into Left Hand Circular Polarization (LHCP) after the reﬂection
oﬀ of the sea surface interface. The degree of right and left decomposition is
driven by the Fresnel reﬂection coeﬃcients, which in turn depend on the elec-
trical properties of the water surface and the geometry. The comparison of
the complex reﬂection coeﬃcients at both circular polarizations yields a well-
known amplitude ratio between the LHCP and RHCP components (Figure 1.1
top), strongly dependent on the angle of incidence. However, as displayed in
Figure 1.1 bottom, the phase between the two polarization components sticks
to a nearly constant value for all incidence angles (variation of 0.0025 degree-
phase/degree-elevation).

Furthermore, the particular value of the relative RH-to-LH phase depends
on the dielectric properties of the sea water (salinity and temperature), covering
a dynamical range of the order of 10 degrees for sea temperature variations, and
a few degrees phase variation to be sensitive to salinity (Figure 1.2).

The hypothesis of POPI is, therefore, that the interferometric phase between
the two circular polarizations can be achieved, and linked to the water proper-
ties. The concept is easily acceptable provided that (a) the reﬂection essentially
specular, (b) the signal is purely polarized, and (c) no other eﬀects shift the
relative RHCP-LHCP phase. Since this is obviously not realistic, point (a) is
discussed under Section 1.2.1, point (b) under Section 1.2.2, and (c) is presented
in Section 1.2.3. The goal is to check whether the dynamical range of the POPI
10 degrees) is above the noise of the technique.

1.2.1 Eﬀect of the sea surface roughness

The reﬂection of L-band signals on the sea surface is not specular solely, but it
scatters energy across a wider lobe, from reﬂection events oﬀ of the specular.
In spite of the relatively long wavelength of the L-band signals, its scattering
oﬀ of the sea surface is often modelled in the Geometrical Optics (GO) limit
of the Kirchoﬀ approximation. It has been proven that GO is valid to explain
a wide range of the GPS reﬂection behaviors (for instance, see [5]). According
to this model, the electromagnetic ﬁeld received at a certain point above the
surface is the sum of several ﬁeld contributions, each of them coming from a
specular reﬂection on a smooth and well oriented faced (mirror-like patch) of
the surface (Figure 1.3). Therefore, if we note the contribution from the i-facet
as Escat

, the received ﬁeld at p-polarization reads

Each scattered ﬁeld at each polarization p relates to the incident ﬁeld through
the Fresnel reﬂection coeﬃcients Rp, Escatp

signals are RHCP, meaning that the RH component of the total ﬁeld after
reﬂection comes from the co-polar coeﬃcient (Rco), whilst the LH component is

Note that the assumption here is stronger than those for conjugate multiplica-
tion. If simpliﬁcations made out of this formulation are close enough to the real
eﬀects of the roughness on the scattering process, the conjugate product and/or
the complex ratio would permit the extraction of φP OP I , which means that even
if roughness adds randomness to each component of the scattered ﬁeld, its rel-
ative complex conjugate product or/and ratio keeps coherent (smooth constant
phase). If so, these RH+LH ﬁeld combinations could be coherently integrated
for long periods of time.

The anisotropies of the roughness have not been tackled in this work. Further
research is required to assess its possible contribution to RH-to-LH relative phase
(longitudinal wave structures imprinting certain linear polarization? i.e. a shift
in the RH-to-LH phase? a few more details on this topic are under Section
2.4.1).

1.2.2 Mixed incident polarizations

When the incident polarization is not RH-pure, but it has a leakage of LH, and
only a factor f of the amplitude comes from RHCP, the incident power splits
as

1.2.3 Other contributions to relative phase shift

Besides the roughness and the mixture of polarizations, other factors might shift
the RH-to-LH relative phase. For instance, the antenna pattern could aﬀect
diﬀerently each polarization, not only in terms of power, but also their phases.
This would thus require absolute calibration of the involved receiving antennas,
and the use of a sensitive double polarization antenna in direct observations.

The ionosphere and the magnetic ﬁeld provoke a Faraday rotation on the sig-
nals, which is in principle diﬀerent at each polarization. Nevertheless, provided
that the receiver is below the ionosphere (aircrafts, balloons, ground platforms),
the signal crossing this ionized layer is the RH solely, before splitting in RH+LH
at the reﬂection event, meaning that both LH and RH components are aﬀected
with the same ionospheric phase leap. This is illustrated in Figure 1.4. Note
that when the receiver is above the ionosphere, the diﬀerential Fadaray rotation
induced at LH and RH does need to be accounted. Possible solutions are to
use multiple frequency information, or models of the electron content and the
Earth magnetic ﬁeld.

or above (bottom) of the ionospheric layer. In the former case no corrections
need to be applied to extract the POPI phase.

POPI on real data

Two sets of experimental campaigns have been conducted with a dedicated
GPS reﬂections real-time hardware receiver, which provides 1-ms integrated
complex waveforms, 64-lags each, from 10 channels of correlation and up to
3 simultaneous diﬀerent RF inputs (antennas). The instrument, called GPS
Open Loop Diﬀerential Real-Time Receiver (GOLD-RTR) can be set to acquire
delay or delay-Doppler maps at L1-GPS frequency and both polarizations, with
ﬂexibility to sequentially change the settings along the experiment, with 1 Hz
maximum rate of change of the conﬁguration. More information about the
GOLD-RTR can be found at [7].

∼

10000 m altitude and

The ﬁrst set of campaigns is a series of 3 ﬂights conducted in July 2005 with
a CESNA CITATION I jet aircraft, ﬂying at
140
m/s speed, along the Catalan Coast (North-West Mediterranean Sea), with the
purpose of testing the GOLD-RTR performance (GOLD-TEST campaign, [8]).
The later set of campaigns were conducted in the Norway Coast during April
2006: 12 ﬂights on board a Skyvan aircraft, cruising at
3000 m altitude
and
125 m/s speed across a salinity and temperature front [4]. The GOLD-
RTR settings for these experiments are displayed in Figure 2.1. The Skyvan
was also payloaded with a infrared proﬁled (for sea surface temperature) and a
radiometer for sea surface brightness (temperature and/or salinity).

The current (draft) version of the Technical Note analyzes data from the
2nd ﬂight of GOLD-TEST campaign (July 14 2006). The wind conditions over
the area were mild, as showed in Figure 2.2.

A sample of 10 minutes data, coherently integrated at 10-ms batches, is
displayed in Figure 2.3, showing that even if the LH signal reaches the receiver
with randomly sequenced phase, the LH to RH relative phase (φP OP I ) gets
coherence.

Figure 2.1: Instrumental settings used to acquire the data set presented in this
work. An important issue is that the down-looking antennas, used to collect
GPS reﬂected signals, are physically located at two diﬀerent spots, 12 cm a
part. The geometrical projection of such a baseline into the scattering direction
enters, straightforward, as a relative phase between both LH and RH signals.

2.1 Conjugate Product vs Ratio

The POPI technique has been applied to raw data taken during the second ﬂight
of July Campaigns, using both Conjugate Product and Ratio approaches. In
general for this particular case (10 km receiver altitude and mild wind) the con-
jugate product yields more stable and robust results than the Ratio, regardless
of the elevation angle. The improvement of one approach with respect to the
other increases with the accumulation time. This is illustrated in Figures 2.4
and 2.5.

2.2 Coherence of POPI

As described at the end of Section 1.2.1, if the assumptions under POPI were
true, the POPI products would be coherent during long periods of time (long co-
herence between RH and LH received ﬁelds). That is, ERH ELH∗
and ERH /ELH
could be longly accumulated as complex numbers without fading eﬀects, and
its phase value would keep constant. This is indeed true as showed in Figure
2.6, where the POPI phase, computed from 10-ms waveforms and accumulated
in the complex plane for 1 to 10 seconds (mean of the complex values) is plot-
ted along
16 minutes, the amplitude of the POPI is also displayed, nearly
equivalent regardless of the integration span.

∼

A measure of the coherence is given by the autocorrelation function, here

deﬁned as.

Z
The AC of a random ﬁeld quickly drops as τ increases. The discrete evaluation
of Equation 2.1 for both LH ﬁeld and POPI is collected in Figure 2.7. The
LH ﬁeld loses coherence around 20-30 ms integration, whereas the POPI keeps
a relatively high and constant level of coherence during a long period of time.
The same ﬁgure contains the phase of the autocorrelation, which is zero for
coherent series, such as POPI. The autocorrelation of the rest of the collected
PRNs presents the same pattern, although the coherence level slightly changes
depending on the satellite, but not on its elevation (Figure 2.8).

2.3 Precision

The formal precision of the POPI measurements can be expressed by the stan-
dard deviation of the POPI phase, since it gives an idea of the noise of the
series, its robustness, and therefore its feasibility to detect variations in the
salinity/temperature (a reminder on the dynamical range: sensitivity better
than 10 degrees in POPI phase is required). In general, we expect diversity of
performances at diﬀerent satellites, elevation angles, and integration time. Two
diﬀerent deﬁnitions for the σ of the POPI phase have been used, one computed
with the standard deviation of its real and imaginary parts, and the other com-
puted as the standard deviation of the RMS-phases (understanding RMS-phases
as the phases computed using the RMS spread of its real and imaginary parts).

Their means and median values are summarized in Table 2.1. As shown in
Figure 2.10, large sigmas mostly correspond to cases with low POPI amplitude
(low RH, LH ﬁelds, or both). These cases are concentrate at low elevation angles
of observation, although not all the observations at grazing angles have high σs
(Figure 2.9).

The conclusion from this exercise is that POPI, under the particular condi-
tions of the actual real data set used for the analysis (10 km altitude aircraft,
relatively low wind regime), is able to detect the RH to LH relative phase at
a few degrees (around 3) formal precision, within the dynamical range of the
global oceanic geophysical signatures. Nonetheless, this would only allow to
detect variations in the sea surface temperature of the order of several degrees
(6 to 15), and very weak sensitivity to salinity. The eﬀect of the roughness and
the aircraft altitude must be investigated with the data set from CoSMOS-OS
campaign.

The current instrumental implementation of the technique cannot provide abso-
lute measurements of the polarimetric interferometric phase, required to obtain
the exact values of the geophysical product. In fact, the phase POPI values,
expected between 150 and 170 degrees (Figure 1.2), take a diversity of values,
as displayed in Figure 2.11. The reasons are multi-fold:

•

•

•

The RH and LH reﬂected signals are collected from two separate antennas,
the baseline between them is therefore introducing a relative phase that
depends on the geometry of the observation. This drawback could be
easily solved by using a single RH+LH antenna with a minimal eﬀective
baseline between the RH and LH phase centers. More details about the
baseline eﬀect are exposed under Section 2.4.1.

The antenna patterns might eﬀect the phase diﬀerently. Currently we do
not have the measurements of the actual antennas used in the experimental
set up. The eﬀects of the aircraft structure on the basis of the antenna
should be investigated. Are these eﬀects reduced when using a single
bi-polarimetric antenna?

In case the incoming GPS signals (before scattering) are not RH-pure,
which is the real incident fraction? is it signiﬁcant enough to consider
eﬀects by transmitter antenna patterns? Since an absolute calibration
of the transmitting antennas on-board the GPS satellites is impossible,
a shortcut solution for the calibration might be the use of a single bi-
polarimetric antenna for the reception of the direct links (former tests
with real data using RH and LH antennas pointing to the zenith has
proven it feasible [9]). This topic also arises the question about whether
up to which degree the current POPI approach is indeed comparing RH
and LH or a remaining LH leakage within the RH antenna. This question
also requires further research.

Similarly, antenna eﬀects due to near ﬁeld phenomena, such as re-radiation
at swapped polarization, antenna coupling, impedance mismatching... could
provoke that these particular POPI products are not really polarimetric.
These problems would be solved by using a single bi-polarimetric antenna,
but they hinder now the understanding of this POPI data set [an indica-
tor that the near ﬁeld coupling eﬀects are not important is to detect the
matching between the baseline projection and the POPI variations, oth-
erwise these eﬀects would lead to another interferometric phase series,
probably constant].

2.4.1 Baseline and correlators jump

In our experiment, the two down-looking antennas were set at 12cm baseline
(of the order of half λ). The baseline between both antennas introduce a phase
given by the projection between the 3D-baseline vector ( ~B), and the unitary
vector pointing from the specular reﬂection point towards the antenna (ˆus). The
projection is the excess path delay between both rays, which can be expressed

Figure 2.11: This graphic contains 120 seconds of POPI complex ﬁelds, at
1 second integration, for the set of acquired satellites. The absolute phase of
the POPI phasors should stick between 150 and 170 degrees, but they rather
spread across the complex plane. The reasons of this inaccuracy in the absolute
measurement are listed in Section 2.4.

The aircraft was equipped with an inertial system, and the baseline vectors
were precisely measured. From the combination of these chips of information,
together with the GPS orbits and aircraft trajectory, we have obtained the
model for ∆φbaseline along time and for each visible satellite. An example is
exposed in Figure 2.12, for 1000 seconds of PRN24 (July 14 2005).

Moreover, the correlation models inside the GOLD-RTR instrument use his-
torical accumulated information for the phase. This becomes a problem when a
pair of correlation channels have diﬀerent history within the same run of the re-
ceiver. The current solution of this problem is to conﬁgure the data acquisition
accordingly. Since it was not the case in the existing data sets, a jump in the
POPI phase is detected whenever a PRN RH+LH couple switch from a pair of
correlator channels to another pair.

The ﬁrst minutes of POPI angle (before any maneuvering and swapping of
the correlators) have been corrected by the baseline projection. The resulting
corrected POPI angles correlate with the azimuth of the scattering planes (Fig-
ure 2.13). This phenomena needs further understanding, it could be related
to instrumental issues (eﬀective linear polarization of the synthesized RH+LH
antenna, or/and eﬀects of linear polarization due to longitudinal structure of
the sea surface waves?).

Summary

A new technique has been suggested to extract dielectric properties of the
sea surface by means of phase interference between the RH and LH GNSS
reﬂected signals. The dynamical range of global sea surface temperature
and salinity variations covers of the order of 10 degrees of POPI phase.
Precisions below this range are required to be sensitive to this variability.

The technique is supported through two theoretical approaches, either the
Complex Ratio of the received reﬂected ﬁelds or its Product by the Com-
plex Conjugate. In both cases, the theoretical formulation requires some
strong assumptions to make them work over rough surfaces. It has been
proven that the product by complex conjugate yields better performance
for the particular case tackled in this study (see next point).

The concept has been tested on real data, collected through a GPS reﬂec-
tions dedicated hardware receiver. The analysis presented so far comes
from one ﬂight conducted in July 2005 at
10 km altitude and mild wind
conditions.

∼

It has been proven that, in spite of the random behavior of each of the
complex ﬁelds (LH is non-coherent after 20-30 ms complex integration),
the POPI ﬁeld keeps coherent for long periods of time. For instance, the
autocorrelation function of the POPI scarcely drops between 20 ms and
50 seconds integration, stuck around 0.3 to 0.5 value (it depends on the
satellite).

Such a long correlation is conﬁrmed by the self-consistency of the POPI
ﬁeld, which yields nearly the same phase and amplitude values whatever
complex integration period is applied.

The POPI phase achieves a formal precision level of a few degrees (around
3 degrees), i.e., within the dynamical range of the global geophysical vari-
ations of the sea surface properties.

The performance under diﬀerent aircraft altitudes and sea roughness states
must be also assessed. The eﬀect of roughness anisotropies must be also
tackled (might longitudinal wave structures imprint certain linear polar-
ization, a shift in the RH-to-LH relative phase?).

Several issues hinder the accuracy of the measurement in the current set-
tings. Many of them would be minimized by simple improvements in
the acquisition system or programming of the receiver (geometric base-
line between two separate RH, LH antennas; RH+LH incident mixture;
leaps due to swapping correlator channels). The others require further
research, since they could constraint the ﬁnal performance of the accu-
racy (absolute) POPI measurements, and could determine whether the
results presented here correspond to POlarimetric Interferometry, or they
rather correspond to the correlation with remaining LH signals in the RH-
antenna output. This is the foremost open question to be solved
before claiming the detection of POPI.

Water waves generated by a moving bottom

Denys Dutykh∗

Fr´ed´eric Dias∗

Abstract

Tsunamis are often generated by a moving sea bottom. This pa-
per deals with the case where the tsunami source is an earthquake.
The linearized water-wave equations are solved analytically for vari-
ous sea bottom motions. Numerical results based on the analytical
solutions are shown for the free-surface proﬁles, the horizontal and
vertical velocities as well as the bottom pressure.

1 Introduction

Waves at the surface of a liquid can be generated by various mechanisms:
wind blowing on the free surface, wavemaker, moving disturbance on the
bottom or the surface, or even inside the liquid, fall of an object into the
liquid, liquid inside a moving container, etc. In this paper, we concentrate
on the case where the waves are created by a given motion of the bottom.
One example is the generation of tsunamis by a sudden seaﬂoor deformation.
There are diﬀerent natural phenomena that can lead to a tsunami. For
example, one can mention submarine slumps, slides, volcanic explosions, etc.
In this article we use a submarine faulting generation mechanism as tsunami
source. The resulting waves have some well-known features. For example,
characteristic wavelengths are large and wave amplitudes are small compared
with water depth.

Two factors are usually necessary for an accurate modelling of tsunamis:
information on the magnitude and distribution of the displacements caused
by the earthquake, and a model of surface gravity waves generation resulting
from this motion of the seaﬂoor. Most studies of tsunami generation assume
that the initial free-surface deformation is equal to the vertical displacement
of the ocean bottom. The details of wave motion are neglected during the
time that the source operates. While this is often justiﬁed because the earth-
quake rupture occurs very rapidly, there are some speciﬁc cases where the
time scale of the bottom deformation may become an important factor. This
was emphasized for example by Trifunac and Todorovska [1], who consid-
ered the generation of tsunamis by a slowly spreading uplift of the seaﬂoor
and were able to explain some observations. During the 26 December 2004
Sumatra-Andaman event, there was in the northern extent of the source a
relatively slow faulting motion that led to signiﬁcant vertical bottom motion
but left little record in the seismic data. It is interesting to point out that it
is the inversion of tide-gauge data from Paradip, the northernmost of the In-
dian east-coast stations, that led Neetu et al. [2] to conclude that the source
length was greater by roughly 30% than the initial estimate of Lay et al. [3].
Incidentally, the generation time is also longer for landslide tsunamis.

Our study is restricted to the water region where the incompressible Euler
equations for potential ﬂow can be linearized. The wave propagation away
from the source can be investigated by shallow water models which may
or may not take into account nonlinear eﬀects and frequency dispersion.
Such models include the Korteweg-de Vries equation [4] for unidirectional
propagation, nonlinear shallow-water equations and Boussinesq-type models
[5, 6, 7].

Several authors have modeled the incompressible ﬂuid layer as a special

1 Introduction

case of an elastic medium [8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. In our opinion it may be conve-
nient to model the liquid by an elastic material from a mathematical point
of view, but it is questionable from a physical point of view. The crust
was modeled as an elastic isotropic half-space. This assumption will also be
adopted in the present study.

The problem of tsunami generation has been considered by a number of
authors: see for example [13, 14, 15]. The models discussed in these papers
lack ﬂexibility in terms of modelling the source due to the earthquake. The
present paper provides some extensions. A good review on the subject is
[16].

Here we essentially follow the framework proposed by Hammack [17] and
others. The tsunami generation problem is reduced to a Cauchy-Poisson
boundary value problem in a region of constant depth. The main extensions
given in the present paper consist in three-dimensional modelling and more
realistic source models. This approach was followed recently in [1, 18], where
the mathematical model was the same as in [17] but the source was diﬀerent.
Most analytical studies of linearized wave motion use integral transform
methods. The complexity of the integral solutions forced many authors [9,
19] to use asymptotic methods such as the method of stationary phase to
In the present study we
estimate the far-ﬁeld behaviour of the solutions.
have also obtained asymptotic formulas for integral solutions. They are useful
from a qualitative point of view, but in practice it is better to use numerical
integration formulas [20] that take into account the oscillatory nature of the
integrals. All the numerical results presented in this paper were obtained in
this manner.

One should use asymptotic solutions with caution since they approximate
exact solutions of the linearized problem. The relative importance of linear
and nonlinear eﬀects can be measured by the Stokes (or Ursell) number [21]:

U :=

a/h
(kh)2 =

a
k2h3 ,

where k is a wave number, a a typical wave amplitude and h the water depth.
For U
1, the nonlinear eﬀects control wave propagation and only nonlinear
models are applicable. Ursell [21] proved that near the wave front U behaves
like

≫

∼
Hence, regardless of how small nonlinear eﬀects are initially, they will become
important.

Section 2 provides a description of the tsunami source when the source is
an earthquake. In Section 3, we review the water-wave equations and provide

the analytical solution to the linearized problem in the ﬂuid domain. Section
4 is devoted to numerical results based on the analytical solution.

2 Source model

The inversion of seismic wave data allows the reconstruction of perma-
nent deformations of the sea bottom following earthquakes. In spite of the
complexity of the seismic source and of the internal structure of the earth, sci-
entists have been relatively successful in using simple models for the source.
One of these models is Okada’s model [22]. Its description follows.

The fracture zones, along which the foci of earthquakes are to be found,
have been described in various papers. For example, it has been suggested
that Volterra’s theory of dislocations might be the proper tool for a quantita-
tive description of these fracture zones [23]. This suggestion was made for the
following reason. If the mechanism involved in earthquakes and the fracture
zones is indeed one of fracture, discontinuities in the displacement compo-
nents across the fractured surface will exist. As dislocation theory may be
described as that part of the theory of elasticity dealing with surfaces across
which the displacement ﬁeld is discontinuous, the suggestion makes sense.

As is often done in mathematical physics, it is necessary for simplicity’s
sake to make some assumptions. Here we neglect the curvature of the earth,
its gravity, temperature, magnetism, non-homogeneity, and consider a semi-
inﬁnite medium, which is homogeneous and isotropic. We further assume
that the laws of classical linear elasticity theory hold.

Several studies showed that the eﬀect of earth curvature is negligible for
shallow events at distances of less than 20◦ [24, 25, 26]. The sensitivity
to earth topography, homogeneity, isotropy and half-space assumptions was
studied and discussed recently [27]. A commercially available code, ABA-
CUS, which is based on a ﬁnite element model (FEM), was used. Six FEMs
were constructed to test the sensitivity of deformation predictions to each
assumption. The author came to the conclusion that the vertical layering of
lateral inhomogeneity can sometimes cause considerable eﬀects on the defor-
mation ﬁelds.

The usual boundary conditions for dealing with earth problems require
that the surface of the elastic medium (the earth) shall be free from forces.
The resulting mixed boundary-value problem was solved a century ago [28].
Later, Steketee proposed an alternative method to solve this problem using
Green’s functions [23].

2.1 Volterra’s theory of dislocations

In order to introduce the concept of dislocation and for simplicity’s sake,
this section is devoted to the case of an entire elastic space, as was done in
the original paper by Volterra [28].

Let O be the origin of a Cartesian coordinate system in an inﬁnite elastic
medium, xi the Cartesian coordinates (i = 1, 2, 3), and ei a unit vector in
direction. A force F = F ek at O generates a displacement

tensor

i (P, O) =

(δikr, nn −

αr, ik), with α =

(1)

λ + µ
λ + 2µ

.

In this relation δik is the Kronecker delta, λ and µ are Lam´e’s constants,
and r is the distance from P to O. The coeﬃcient α can be rewritten as
α = 1/2(1
ν), where ν is Poisson’s ratio. Later we will also use Young’s
modulus E, which is deﬁned as

−

E =

µ (3λ + 2µ)
λ + µ

.

The notation r, i means ∂r/∂xi and the summation convention applies.

The stresses due to the displacement ﬁeld (1) are easily computed from

Hooke’s law:

The components of the force per unit area on a surface element are denoted
as follows:

i = σk
T k
where the νj’s are the components of the normal to the surface element. A
Volterra dislocation is deﬁned as a surface Σ in the elastic medium across
which there is a discontinuity ∆ui in the displacement ﬁelds of the type

∆ui = u+

i = Ui + Ωijxj,

Equation (3) in which Ui and Ωij are constants is the well-known Weingarten
relation which states that the discontinuity ∆ui should be of the type of a

rigid body displacement, thereby maintaining continuity of the components
of stress and strain across Σ.

The displacement ﬁeld in an inﬁnite elastic medium due to the dislocation

is then determined by Volterra’s formula [28]

Once the surface Σ is given, the dislocation is essentially determined by

the six constants Ui and Ωij. Therefore we also write

where Ωij takes only the values Ω12, Ω23, Ω31. Following Volterra [28] and
Love [29] we call each of the six integrals in (6) an elementary dislocation.

It is clear from (5) and (6) that the computation of the displacement ﬁeld
uk(Q) is performed as follows. A force F ek is applied at Q, and the stresses
σk
ij(P, Q) that this force generates are computed at the points P (xi) on Σ. In
particular the components of the force on Σ are computed. After multipli-
cation with prescribed weights of magnitude ∆ui these forces are integrated
over Σ to give the displacement component in Q due to the dislocation on
Σ.

2.2 Dislocations in elastic half-space

When the case of an elastic half-space is considered, equation (5) remains
valid, but we have to replace σk
ij in T k
ij. This can
be explained by the fact that the elementary solutions for a half-space are
diﬀerent from Somigliana solution (1).

i by another tensor ωk

The ωk

ij can be obtained from the displacements corresponding to nuclei
of strain in a half-space through relation (2). Steketee showed a method of
obtaining the six ωk
12, which
is relevant to a vertical strike-slip fault (see below). Maruyama derived the
remaining ﬁve functions [30].

ij ﬁelds by using a Green’s function and derived ωk

It is interesting to mention here that historically these solutions were ﬁrst
derived in a straightforward manner by Mindlin [31, 32], who gave explicit
expressions of the displacement and stress ﬁelds for half-space nuclei of strain
consisting of single forces with and without moment. It is only necessary to
write the single force results since the other forms can be obtained by taking
appropriate derivatives. The method consists in ﬁnding the displacement

ﬁeld in Westergaard’s form of the Galerkin vector [33]. This vector is then
determined by taking a linear combination of some biharmonic elementary
solutions. The coeﬃcients are chosen to satisfy boundary and equilibrium
conditions. These solutions were also derived by Press in a slightly diﬀerent
manner [34].

2.3 Finite rectangular source

Let us now consider a more practical problem. We deﬁne the elemen-
tary dislocations U1, U2 and U3, corresponding to the strike-slip, dip-slip and
tensile components of an arbitrary dislocation. In Figure 1 each vector rep-
resents the direction of the elementary faults. The vector D is the so-called
Burger’s vector, which shows how both sides of the fault are spread out:

the angle φ between the fault plane and Burger’s vector D. When dealing
with a geophysical application, an additional angle, the azimuth or strike,
is introduced in order to provide an orientation of the fault. The general

For a ﬁnite rectangular fault with length L and width W occurring at

a change of variables and by integrating over the rectangle. This was done
by several authors [22, 35, 36, 37, 38]. Here we give the results of their

2.4 Curvilinear fault

In the previous subsection analytical formulas for the free-surface defor-
mation in the special case of a rectangular fault were given. In fact, Volterra’s
formula (5) allows to evaluate the displacement ﬁeld that accompanies fault
events with much more general geometry. The shape of the fault and Burger’s
vector are suggested by seismologists and after numerical integration one can
obtain the deformation of the seaﬂoor for more general types of events as well.
Here we will consider the case of a fault whose geometry is described by
an elliptical arc (see Figure 6). The parametric equations of this surface are

The numerical integration was performed using a 9-point two-dimensional
Gauss-type integration formula. The result is presented on Figure 7. The
parameter values are given in Table 2.

The example considered in this subsection may not be physically relevant.
However it shows how Okada’s solution can be extended. For a more precise
modeling of the faulting event we need to have more information about the
earthquake source and its related parameters.

After having reviewed the description of the source, we now switch to the
deformation of the ocean surface following a submarine earthquake. The tra-
ditional approach for hydrodynamic modelers is to use elastic models similar
to the model we just described with the seismic parameters as input in order
to evaluate the details of the seaﬂoor deformation. Then this deformation is
translated to the free surface of the ocean and serves as initial condition of
the evolution problem described in the next section.

3 Solution in ﬂuid domain

The ﬂuid domain is supposed to represent the ocean above the fault area.
Let us consider the ﬂuid domain Ω shown in Figure 8. It is bounded above by
the free surface of the ocean and below by the rigid ocean ﬂoor. The domain
Ω is unbounded in the horizontal directions x and y, and can be written as

Ω = R2

[
−

×

h + ζ(x, y, t), η(x, y, t)] .

Initially the ﬂuid is assumed to be at rest and the sea bottom to be horizontal.
Thus, at time t = 0, the free surface and the sea bottom are deﬁned by z = 0
and z =
h, respectively. For time t > 0 the bottom boundary moves in a
prescribed manner which is given by

−

z =

h + ζ(x, y, t).

The displacement of the sea bottom is assumed to have all the properties
required to compute its Fourier transform in x, y and its Laplace transform in
t. The resulting deformation of the free surface z = η(x, y, t) must be found.
It is also assumed that the ﬂuid is incompressible and the ﬂow is irrotational.
The latter implies the existence of a velocity potential φ(x, y, z, t) which
completely describes this ﬂow. By deﬁnition of φ, the ﬂuid velocity vector
can be expressed as q =

φ. Thus, the continuity equation becomes

Finding the solution to this problem is quite a diﬃcult task due to the
nonlinearities and the a priori unknown free surface. In this study we linearize
the equations and the boundary conditions by taking the limit as κa
0.
In fact, the linearized problem can be found by expanding the unknown
functions as power series of a small parameter ε := κa. Collecting the lowest
order terms in ε yields the linear approximation. For the sake of convenience,
we now switch back to the physical variables. The linearized problem in

The transformed free-surface elevation can be obtained from (16):

A general solution of equation (18) is given by

φ(k, ℓ, z, s) = A(k, ℓ, s) cosh(mz) + B(k, ℓ, s) sinh(mz),

(22)

where m = √k2 + ℓ2. The functions A(k, ℓ, s) and B(k, ℓ, s) can be easily

The last equation gives the general integral solution of the problem in the
case of an axisymmetric seabed deformation. Below we no longer make this
assumption since Okada’s solution does not have this property.

In the present study we consider seabed deformations with the following

structure:

ζ(x, y, t) := ζ(x, y)T (t).

(26)

Mathematically we separate the time dependence from the spatial coordi-
nates. There are two main reasons for doing this. First of all we want to
be able to invert analytically the Laplace transform. The second reason is
more fundamental. In fact, dynamic source models are not easily available.
Okada’s solution, which was described in the previous section, provides the
static sea-bed deformation ζ0(x, y) and we will consider diﬀerent time depen-
dencies T (t) to model the time evolution of the source. Four scenarios will
be considered:

1. Instantaneous: Ti(t) = H(t), where H(t) denotes the Heaviside step

function,

Clearly, η(x, y, t) depends continuously on the source ζ(x, y). Physically
it means that small variations of ζ (in a reasonable space of functions such
as L2) yield small variations of η. Mathematically this problem is said to be
well-posed, and this property is essential for modelling the physical processes,
since it means that small modiﬁcations of the ground motion (for example,
the error in measurements) do not induce huge modiﬁcations of the wave
patterns.

Using the special representation (26) of seabed deformation and pre-
scribed time-dependencies, one can compute analytically the Laplace integral
in (27). To perform this integration, we ﬁrst have to compute the Laplace
transform of Ti,e,c,l(t). The results are

this work is to provide an initial condition for tsunami propagation codes.
For the time being, tsunami modelers take initial seabed deformations and
translate them directly to the free surface in order to obtain the initial
condition η(x, y, 0). Since a priori there is no information on the ﬂow ve-
locities, they take a zero velocity ﬁeld as initial condition for the velocity:
φ(x, y, z, 0) = 0. The present computations show that it is indeed a very

some notation. The horizontal velocities are denoted by u. The horizontal
gradient (∂/∂x, ∂/∂y) is denoted by
∇h. The vertical velocity component is
simply w. The Fourier transform parameters are denoted k = (k, ℓ).

The easiest way to compute the vertical velocity w along the free surface
is to use the boundary condition (14). Indeed, the expression for w can be
simply derived by diﬀerentiating the known formula for ηi,e,c,l(x, y, t). Note
that formally the derivative gives the distributions δ(t) and δ(t
t0) under
the integral sign. It is a consequence of the idealized time behaviour (such as
the instantaneous scenario) and it is a disadvantage of the Laplace transform
method. In order to avoid these distributions we can consider the solutions
only for t > 0 and t
= t0. From a practical point of view there is no restriction
since for any ε > 0 we can set t = ε or t = t0 + ε. For small values of ε
this will give a very good approximation of the solution behaviour at these

3.3 Pressure on the bottom

Since tsunameters have one component that measures the pressure at the
bottom (bottom pressure recorder or simply BPR [40]), it is interesting to
provide as well the expression pb(x, y, t) for the pressure at the bottom. The
pressure p(x, y, z, t) can be obtained from Bernoulli’s equation, which was
written explicitly for the free surface in equation (11), but is valid everywhere
in the ﬂuid:

3.4 Asymptotic analysis of integral solutions

In this subsection, we apply the method of stationary phase in order to
estimate the far-ﬁeld behaviour of the solutions. There is a lot of literature
on this topic (see for example [41, 42, 43, 44, 45]). This method is a classical
method in asymptotic analysis. To our knowledge, the stationary phase
method was ﬁrst used by Kelvin [46] in the context of linear water-wave
theory.

The motivation to obtain asymptotic formulas for integral solutions was
mainly due to numerical diﬃculties to calculate the solutions for large values
of x and y. From equation (25), it is clear that the integrand is highly os-
cillatory. In order to be able to resolve these oscillations, several discretiza-
tion points are needed per period. This becomes extremely expensive as
r =
. The numerical method used in the present study
is based on a Filon-type quadrature formula [20] and has been adapted to
double integrals with exp[i(kx + ℓy)] oscillations. The idea of this method
consists in interpolating only the amplitude of the integrand at discretiza-
tion points by some kind of polynomial or spline and then performing exact

integration for the oscillating part of the integrand. This method seems to
be quite eﬃcient.

Let us ﬁrst obtain an asymptotic representation for integral solutions of

the general form

For example, we showed above that for an instantaneous seabed deformation
T (m, t) = cos ωt, where ω2 = gm tanh mh. For the time being, we do not
specify the time behaviour T(s).

In equation (32), we switch to polar coordinates m and ψ = arctan(ℓ/k):

phase function is Φ = mr cos(ϕ
condition ∂Φ/∂ψ = 0, which yields two phases: ψ1 = ϕ and ψ2 = ϕ + π. An
approximation to equation (32) is then obtained by applying the method of
stationary phase to the integral over ψ:

This expression cannot be simpliﬁed if we do not make any further hypotheses
on the function T (m, t).

Since we are looking for the far ﬁeld solution behaviour, the details of
wave formation are not important. Thus we will assume that the initial
seabed deformation is instantaneous:

T (m, t) = cos ωt =

Asymptotic values have been obtained for the integrals. As is easily observed
from the expressions for I1 and I2, the wave train decays as 1/t, or 1/r, which
is equivalent since r and t are connected by relation (34).

4 Numerical results

A lot of numerical computations based on the analytical formulas ob-
tained in the previous sections have been performed. Because of the lack of
information about the real dynamical characteristics of tsunami sources, we
cannot really conclude which time dependence gives the best description of
tsunami generation. At this stage it is still very diﬃcult or even impossible.
Numerical experiments showed that the largest wave amplitudes with the
time dependence Tc(t) were obtained for relatively small values of the char-
acteristic time t0. The exponential dependence has shown higher amplitudes
for relatively longer characteristic times. The instantaneous scenario Ti gives
at the free surface the initial seabed deformation with a slightly lower am-
0.94). The
plitude (the factor that we obtained was typically about 0.8

In this section we provide several plots (Figure 11) of the free-surface
deformation. For illustration purposes, we have chosen the instantaneous
seabed deformation since it is the most widely used. The values of the pa-
rameters used in the computations are given in Table 3. We also give plots of
the velocity components on the free surface a few seconds (physical) after the
instantaneous deformation (Figure 12). Finally, plots of the bottom dynamic
pressure are given in Figure 13.

From Figure 12 it is clear that the velocity ﬁeld is really negligible in
the beginning of wave formation. Numerical computations showed that this
situation does not change if one takes other time-dependences.

The main focus of the present paper is the generation of waves by a moving
bottom. The asymptotic behaviour of various sets of initial data propagating
in a ﬂuid of uniform depth has been studied in detail by Hammack and Segur
[47, 48]. In particular, they showed that the behaviours for an initial elevation
wave and for an initial depression wave are diﬀerent.

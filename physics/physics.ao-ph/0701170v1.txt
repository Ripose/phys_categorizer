Development Region Sea Surface Temperature and Atlantic
Basin Hurricane Numbers

Abstract

We are building a hurricane number prediction scheme that relies, in part, on statistical modelling
of the empirical relationship between Atlantic sea surface temperatures and Atlantic basin hurricane
numbers. We test out a number of simple statistical models for this relationship, using data from
1900 to 2005 and data from 1950 to 2005, and for both all hurricane numbers and intense hurricane
numbers.

1 Introduction

We are interested in developing practical methods for the prediction of the distribution of the number of
hurricanes that might make landfall in the US over the next 5 years. We are investigating a number of
ways that one might make such a prediction, such as methods based on a change point analysis of the
historical hurricane record (see Binter et al. (2006) or Jewson and O’Shay (2006)), and methods based
on predictions of sea surface temperatures (SST). This article contributes to the development of one
particular 3 step SST method that works as follows:

1. We predict the distribution of possible SSTs in the main development region (MDR) over the next

5 years

2. We predict the distribution of the number of hurricanes in the Atlantic, given the SST forecast
from step 1, using a model for the relationship between MDR SST and Atlantic hurricane numbers

3. We predict the distribution of the number of hurricanes making US landfall, given the prediction for
the number in the Atlantic from step 2, and a model for the relationship between Atlantic hurricane
numbers and numbers of hurricanes making landfall in the US

The ﬁrst step, how to predict MDR SST, has been considered in Meagher and Jewson (2006) and Laepple et al.
(2006). We now consider step 2: how to relate MDR SST to the number of hurricanes in the Atlantic basin.
That there is a non-trivial relationship between SST and the number of Atlantic basin hurricanes is both
physically intuitive and is supported by a number of studies in the meteorological literature. For instance,
Peixoto and Oort (1992) discuss how long-term variability in hurricane activity is ultimately driven by the
ocean, with its large thermal and mechanical inertia. Also, ocean SSTs play a direct role in providing en-
ergy to developing tropical cyclones (Landsea et al., 1999a; Saunders and Harris, 1997), and higher SSTs
decrease the stability of the atmosphere, making tropical cyclones more resistant to windshear (Demaria,
1996). Much of this has been known for a long time: Gray (1968) discusses how warm SSTs promote
tropical cyclone development and enhancement. The statistical relationship between Atlantic hurricane
activity and SSTs has been studied by a number of authors (e.g. Shapiro (1982); Shapiro and Goldenberg
(1989); Saunders and Harris (1997); Goldenberg et al. (2001); Landsea et al. (1999b)) and is a key aspect
in a number of recent studies concerning the impacts of long-term climate trends on hurricane frequency
and intensity (e.g. Emanuel et al. (2005); Kerr (2005); Trenberth (2005); Webster et al. (2005); Klotzbach
(2006); Sriver and Huber (2006); Elsner (2006)).

As this is our ﬁrst attempt to relate SST to hurricane numbers, and our ﬁrst attempt to build a forecasting
system on that basis, we are keen to keep our models as simple as possible. For this reason, we restrict
ourselves to representing SST variability using just a single index, and we choose what we think is the
simplest possible reasonable index: the average of summer SST in the MDR region of the tropical Atlantic.
Based on an analysis of correlation between hurricane numbers and MDR SSTs in diﬀerent months we
deﬁne summer to be July to September. In the future it may be appropriate to extend our prediction
system to consider more than one SST index, and to derive our index or indices on the basis of some
kind of regression or eigenvector analysis.
Given our SST index, our goal is to test a number of statistical models that relate this index to the
observed number of hurricanes. We consider both the total number of hurricanes, and the number of
intense hurricanes, where we deﬁne intense as falling in categories 3-5. We ﬁt our statistical models to
data from both 1900-2005 and 1950-2005, for reasons discussed below.
The rest of this article proceeds as follows. In section 2 we brieﬂy discuss the data we use for this study.
In section 3 we present the statistical models we will test. In section 4 we show the results from these
tests, and ﬁnally in section 5 we discuss what we have found.

2 Data

We use two data sets for this study: one for SST, and the other for hurricane numbers.
The SST data we use is HadISST, available from http://www.hadobs.org, and described in Rayner et al.
(2002). From this data we create an annual index consisting of the average SST in the region (10o-20oN,
15o-70oW) for the months July to September. This is exactly the same index as was used in our SST
prediction study described in Laepple et al. (2006).
The hurricane number data is derived from the standard HURDAT data base, available
from http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat, and described in Jarvinen et al. (1984).
In both cases we consider the data to be exact, i.e. without observational errors. This is pragmatic, since
neither data-set is delivered with any estimates of the likely error. However, given the (widely discussed)
possibility that both data sets may be less accurate earlier in the time period we repeat our analyses for
both the periods 1900-2005 and 1950-2005.

3 Models

The main purpose of this article is to compare the performance of a number of simple statistical models
for modelling the relationship between our MDR SST index and observed hurricane numbers. The models
we consider are as follows:

3.1 Models

3.1.1 Poisson distribution independent of SST

The simplest model we consider models the number of hurricanes as a poisson distribution independent
of SST. We include this model as a baseline that the subsequent models should be able to beat.
We write this model as:

n ∼ Po(rate = α)

where n is the number of hurricanes. We estimate the parameter α as the mean of the observed hurricane
numbers.

3.1.2 Linear normal regression

Our next model is plain-vanilla linear regression, with both the residuals and the response modelled as
normal distributions.
We write this model as:

n ∼ N(α + βs, σ2

)

where s is the SST index. We ﬁt the parameters using maximum likelihood, which is equivalent to least
squares in this case.
From the point of view of making point predictions of future hurricane numbers this is a perfectly
reasonable ﬁrst model, and the prediction is α + βs. From the point of view of making a probabilistic
prediction of future hurricane numbers this model is slightly odd, since it models a non-negative integer

(1)

(2)

(the number of hurricanes) using a real number that can be both positive and negative. Nevertheless we
include this model for two reasons: (a) as another baseline for comparison, since it is simple and well
understood, and there is a closed-form solution for the parameters, and (b) since this model can easily
be optimised for predictive purposes (the next model).

3.1.3 Damped linear normal

Our third model is an adaption of linear regression. Standard linear regression, when ﬁtted using in-
sample ﬁtting techniques such as maximum likelihood or least squares, is an inherently overﬁtted model.
In other words, these ﬁtting techniques optimise the model’s ability to predict the training data, but
not to extrapolate. For large samples and strong signals this doesn’t matter, but for smaller samples
and weak signals this means that linear regression does not give good predictions, even when the process
being predicted really does consist of a linear trend plus gaussian noise. Adapting linear regression so
that it is optimised to make good predictions is, however, diﬃcult, and is not guaranteed to be successful.
Our third model is one such simple adaption, due to Jewson and Penzer (2004), in which the slope of the
trend is reduced in order to reduce the overﬁtting. This model may or may not make better predictions
than the unadapted linear regression model because of the diﬃculty of estimating exactly what this slope
reduction should be.
We write this model as:

n ∼ N(α + kβs, σ2

)

We ﬁt this model by ﬁrst ﬁtting the underlying linear regression model, and then calculating the adjust-
ment k using the expressions in Jewson and Penzer (2004).
As with the linear normal model this model is a reasonable model if used to make point predictions,
but is a slightly odd model to use for probabilistic predictions, for the same reasons as given above. We
include it in order to see the extent to which overﬁtting may be an issue.

3.1.4 Linear Poisson

The two normally distributed models given above can be criticized, as probabilistic forecast models, for
using a distribution that is clearly not close to being correct. To overcome this criticism we now change
the distribution from normal to poisson. We write this model as:

(3)

(4)

n ∼ Po(rate = α + βs, σ2

)

We ﬁt this model using iteratively reweighted least squares.
At a mathematical level this model might be criticized because for certain values of the parameters
the poisson rate can be negative. However we have found that this is not a problem for the data and
parameter ranges that are of interest to us.
The standard ﬁtting procedure we use for this model is an in-sample ﬁtting procedure, and thus leads to
inherently overﬁtted parameter estimates, and sub-optimal predictive properties. It would be possible in
principle to ﬁt a ‘damped’ version of this model, in the same way that we have ﬁtted a damped version of
linear regression, in order to attempt to overcome this problem. However there appears to be no simple
analytic way to do this, and one would have to use more complex methods such as cross-validation. That
is beyond the scope of this study, but might be an interesting avenue for future work.

3.1.5 Exponential poisson

The next model that we use is the same as the previous model, but exchanges a linear relationship for the
rate of the poisson distribution for an exponential one. This model is common in the statistical literature,
where it is known as either ‘poisson regression’ or ‘a generalised linear model for the poisson distribution
with a log-linear link function’.
We write this model as:

n ∼ Po(rate = exp(α + βs))

(5)

At a mathematical level this model avoids the potential problem with negative rates described above,
since the rates are positive for all parameter values and data sets. This model has previously been
used to model the relationship between SST and hurricane numbers by Elsner and Schmertmann (1993)
and Solow and Moore (2000).
Comparing the linear poisson and exponential poisson models, one obvious question is, is there any
statistical evidence for the non-linearity included in the exponential poisson model? We will discuss this
question when we present our results below.

3.1.6 Exponential negative binomial

Our ﬁnal model is an adaption of the previous model that allows the distribution around the mean to be
negative binomial rather than exponential, and thus has one extra parameter that allows for the variance
to be diﬀerent from the mean.
We write this model as:

n ∼ NB(mean = α + βs, variance = γ)

(6)

3.2 Model comparison

How are we going to compare the results from these diﬀerent models? We consider two scores, one of
which assesses the ability of the models to make point predictions, and the other of which assesses the
ability of the models to make probabilistic predictions. For each of these scores we consider in-sample
scores, which are not really what we care about, but are included for interest, and out-of-sample scores,
which are the real test. The out-of-sample scores are calculated using leave-one-out cross-validation,
a.k.a. the Quenouille-Tukey jack-knife (Quenouille, 1949; Tukey, 1958).
We score the point predictions using the most obvious score available: the root mean square error. We
score the probabilistic predictions using (what we consider to be) the most obvious probabilistic score,
which is the mean out-of-sample log-likelihood.

4 Results

We now present results from our comparisons of the various models. First we consider models for the
total number of hurricanes, for the periods 1900-2005 and 1950-2005, and then we consider models for
intense hurricane numbers for the same two periods. Correlations between SST and hurricane numbers
for these 4 cases are shown in table 1.
In each of the 4 cases we produce a standard set of diagnostics, consisting of four tables and three graphs.
The four tables are:

• the scores achieved by the models

• the ﬁtted parameter values, including standard error estimates based on the Fisher information

• the percentage of times each model wins in pairwise comparisons, and corresponding p-values for

point predictions

The graphs are:

• pairwise comparisons and corresponding p-values for probabilistic predictions

• a scatter plot showing the data on which the model is based

• the same scatter plot, showing the decade in which each data point occurred

• the same scatter plot showing the ﬁtted curves from the six models

4.1 All hurricanes, 1900-2005

The ﬁrst results we present are based on all hurricanes, and data from 1900 to 2005. The scatter plot
shown in ﬁgure 1 shows a clear relationship between the SSTs and the hurricane numbers during this
period, with warmer SSTs coinciding with more hurricanes. By eye, the relationship looks more or less
linear. The linear correlation was found to be 0.56, while the rank correlation was found to be 0.51, as
shown in table 1.
The decade scatter plot is shown in ﬁgure 2. Note that the most recent period labelled by ‘A’ gives
relatively high SST and basin number count.
Table 2 shows the score comparisons for the six models for this data set. Considering the RMSE scores
we see that all the non-trivial models comfortably beat the trivial ﬂat-line model, as we’d guess would
be the case from the scatter plot. Table 4, which shows results for pairwise comparisons in RMSE, shows
that the diﬀerences between the trivial model and the non-trivial models are statistically signiﬁcant (at
the 5 percent level), with the exception of the exponential binomial model.
The diﬀerences between the performance of the 5 non-trivial models are small. The exponential models
yield the best out-of-sample RMSEs, but none of the RMSE diﬀerences between the ﬁve models are

statistically signiﬁcant. Given that the exponential poisson model gives the second lowest out-of-sample
RMSE and beats the ﬂat poisson model in a statistically signiﬁcant way, one might choose the exponential
poisson model as the best one. However, since the non-trivial models are not diﬀerent in a statistically
signiﬁcant way, one shouldn’t be surprised if that result were overturned given more data.
These models all explain around 30% of the variance in the hurricane number time series.
Considering the out of sample log-likelihood scores in table 2, we ﬁnd that the linear and exponential
poisson are better than the ﬂat poisson model in a statistically signiﬁcant way. The linear and damped
linear normal are worse than the ﬂat poisson model in a statistically signiﬁcant way. The exponential
negative binomial does yield the best out-of-sample log-likelihood score, but the result is not statistically
signiﬁcant. Based on the log-likelihood scores, one might choose the exponential poisson model once
again.
The parameters of all the models are reasonably well estimated: all the parameters given in table 3
are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from zero (judging by the standard error estimates, and assuming normality
for the sampling distributions). For instance, the slopes in the linear models are between 4.3 and 4.6,
with standard error of roughly 0.7. Each extra degree of SST is therefore related to just over 4 more
hurricanes, plus or minus 1.5 hurricanes. The in-sample ﬁts to the data for the various models are
displayed in ﬁgure 3.
The damping parameter in the damped linear trend model is very close to one. This suggests that the
models are not signiﬁcantly overﬁtted, and there is no real need to use such damped models in this case.
This is because the signal is strong enough that we can estimate it reasonably well.

4.2 All hurricanes, 1950-2005

Given the doubts that one might have about the quality of both the SST and the hurricane number data
prior to 1950, it makes sense to repeat the analysis given in the previous section for just the more recent
data from 1950 to 2005. The corresponding results and data plots are provided in tables 6, 7, 8 and 9
and ﬁgures 4, 5 and 6. For this data set, a linear correlation of 0.62 and rank correlation of 0.56 was
found.
There are only small diﬀerences in the results relative to the analysis based on 1900-2005 data. Once again,
the non-trivial models all beat the trivial constant level model. These results are statistically signiﬁcant
for the linear normal, damped linear normal and linear poisson models. The diﬀerences between the non-
trivial models are not, once again, statistically signiﬁcant. Based on these results, one may be inclined
to choose the linear poisson model, as it yields the lowest RMSE of the models that beat the ﬂat poisson
model in a statistically signiﬁcant way.
These models all explain around 40% of the variance in the hurricane number time series (a little higher
than before).
With regards to the log-likelihood scores, the linear and exponential poisson models and the exponential
negative binomial models beat the ﬂat poisson model, whereas the linear normal and damped linear
normal do not. The result for the linear poisson model is statistically signiﬁcant. The linear and damped
linear normal are defeated by the ﬂat poisson model in a statistically signiﬁcant way. Given these results,
one might choose the linear poisson model once again. However, it is possible that this conclusion would
be overturned by using more data as the diﬀerences between the linear poisson, exponential poisson and
exponential negative binomial are not statistically signiﬁcant.
The slope parameters are again signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from zero, but the slope of the linear relations is
now a bit higher, giving between 5.0 and 5.4 hurricanes per degree, with a slightly larger uncertainty of
around 1.0 hurricanes per degree. Given the uncertainties, the slope estimates from the two data sets are
entirely consistent.

4.3 Intense hurricanes, 1900-2005

We now consider the relationship between MDR SST and the number of intense hurricanes. Considering
the scatter plot in ﬁgure 7, and comparing with the scatter plot in ﬁgure 1, we see immediately that
the relationship is less clear than before. The linear correlation for this data set is 0.52 and the rank
correlation is 0.54. This may not be because the underlying relationship is any less strong: simple
statistical arguments suggest that the relationship will appear less strongly in the data just because there
are fewer events.
We now consider the results in tables 10, 11, 12 and 13. The non-trivial models all beat the trivial
constant level model statistically signiﬁcantly, but are not statistically signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from each
other in terms of the RMSE scores. The parameters of all models are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from zero,

and the linear models give roughly 2.9 extra hurricanes per extra degree of SST, with a standard error
of around 0.4. The models explain around 25% of the variability in the number of intense hurricanes.
As far as the log-likelihood scores are concerned, the linear normal and damped linear normal are defeated
by the ﬂat poisson model in a statistically signiﬁcant way. The linear and exponential poisson models
and the negative binomial model defeat the ﬂat poisson model in a statistically signiﬁcant way. The
diﬀerences between the linear poisson, exponential poisson and exponential negative binomial are not
statistically signiﬁcant.

4.4 Intense hurricanes, 1950-2005

Finally we consider intense hurricane numbers for the more recent data, for which results are shown in
tables 14, 15, 16 and 17 and ﬁgures 10 through 12. Once again, the non-trivial models defeat the ﬂat
poisson model in a statistically signiﬁcant way. The diﬀerences among the non-trivial models in this
case are not statistically signiﬁcant. Once again, the parameter estimates for the models appear to be
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from zero. The linear models give a slightly higher number of hurricanes per degree,
roughly around 3.4 extra hurricanes per extra degree, with standard error of around 0.7.
With regards to the log-likelihood scores, the linear normal and damped linear normal are defeated by the
ﬂat poisson model in a statistically signiﬁcant way. The linear poisson and exponential negative binomial
defeat the ﬂat poisson model in a statistically signiﬁcant way, whereas the exponential poisson does not.
The diﬀerences between the linear poisson, exponential poisson and exponential negative binomial are
not statistically signiﬁcant.

5 Summary

We have considered how to model the relationship between MDR SST and the number of hurricanes in the
Atlantic basin. We consider both the total number of hurricanes and the number of intense hurricanes.
W.r.t. the total number of hurricanes our ﬁndings are:

• that there is a clear and statistically signiﬁcant relationship, such that higher SSTs correspond
to higher numbers of hurricanes, with one degree of SST relating to between 4.0 and 5.5 extra
hurricanes

• using only more recent data the relationship is slightly stronger, but is less accurately estimated

• that statistical models of this relationship give better point predictions of hurricane numbers than

a simple model that ignores this relationship

• w.r.t. point predictions, all the non-trivial models defeat the ﬂat poisson model in a statistically
signiﬁcant way with the exception of the exponential poisson and exponential negative binomial
model. The diﬀerences between the non-trivial models are, however, not statistically signiﬁcant.
If one had to choose among the models based on the RMSE results, one might choose the linear
poisson model as it yields the lowest RMSE of the models that beat the trivial model in statistically
signiﬁcant way.

• that the non-trivial models explain between 29% and 44% of the variability in the number of

hurricanes

• w.r.t probabilistic predictions, the linear and damped linear normal models are defeated by the ﬂat
poisson model in a statistically signiﬁcant way. The linear poisson model defeats the ﬂat-line model
in a statistically signiﬁcant way.

That there is a non-trivial relationship between Atlantic MDR SSTs and basin-wide hurricane activity
is in general agreement with statistical analyses performed in both Klotzbach (2006) and Landsea et al.
(1999b).
W.r.t the number of intense hurricanes our ﬁndings are the same, with the exception of:

• each extra degree of SST gives between 3.0 and 3.5 extra intense hurricanes

• the non-trivial models explain slightly less of the variability in the numbers of hurricanes: only 25%

• w.r.t. the point predictions, all the non-trivial models defeat the ﬂat-line model in a statistically

signiﬁcant way.

• w.r.t. the probabilistic predictions, the linear poisson and negative binomial models defeat the ﬂat

poisson model in a statistically signiﬁcant way for both data sets.

Our results for intense hurricanes are broadly consistent with an analysis done by Hoyos et al. (2006)
which suggests that increasing number of category 4-5 hurricanes is directly linked to the trend in tropical
SSTs.
Given all of this, what models would we recommend to use to model the SST to hurricane relationship?
Firstly, it probably makes sense to use only the recent data, since it is possible to estimate the regression
parameters reasonbly well using this data, and it avoids doubts about data quality. Assuming we need
probabilistic forecasts of hurricane activity, then we have seen that the normal distribution models don’t
work well. This leaves 3 reasonable models: linear poisson, exponential poisson, and negative binomial.
We could elimatine the negative binomial model on the basis that it is more complex than the other two,
but performs no better. This then leaves us with the linear poisson and exponential poisson models. On
the basis of our results it is not possible to distinguish between these models, and this is perhaps the
most important result of this paper: even though previous authors have, by default, used an exponential
poisson model for the SST to hurricane number relationship, the linear poisson model works just as well,
and in some forecast applications (especially those that involve applying the modelled SST-hurricane
relationships for extreme values of the SST) is likely to give quite diﬀerent results.
We end by mentioning that a number of studies suggest that the strength of the relationship be-
tween SST and hurricane frequency is dependent on the region of the north Atlantic being considered
(Shapiro and Goldenberg, 1989; Raper, 1993; Goldenberg et al., 2001). Understanding the regional de-
pendence of the statistical relationship between SST and hurricane numbers is therefore an interesting
avenue for future work.

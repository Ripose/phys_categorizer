Abstract. A general approach for the calculation of the incoherent intensity
scattered by a random medium with rough boundaries has been developed
using a Green function formalism. The random medium consists of spherical
particles whose physical repartition is described by a pair-distribution function.
The boundary contribution is included in the Green functions with the help of
scattering operators which can represent any existing theory of scattering by
rough surfaces. By using a standard procedure, we derive the integral Bethe-
Salpeter equation under the ladder approximation and, by diﬀerentiation, the
vectorial radiative transfer equation. Furthermore, with the help of our formalism,
the boundary conditions necessary to solve the radiative transfer equation are
expressed in terms of the scattering operators of the rough surfaces. Finally,
using the reciprocity properties of the Green functions, we are able to include
the enhanced backscattering contributions to take into account every state of
polarization of the incident and the scattered waves.

Electromagnetic wave scattering from a random layer with rough interfaces II

1. Introduction

In the preceding paper [1] (referred as I), we have developed a general formalism
based on Green functions to calculate the electromagnetic ﬁeld scattered by a random
medium with rough boundaries. In using these Green functions, we have determined
the average electric ﬁeld, also named the coherent ﬁeld.
In this paper, we use the
formalism developed in I to calculate the diﬀusive intensity also named incoherent
intensity.

The study of electromagnetic wave propagation through random media has been
an intensive ﬁeld of research for many decades [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,
14, 15, 16]. Many aspects of the transport of waves in such media are well described
by the phenomenological radiative transfer theory [2, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 14, 16]. In this
approach, the main quantity, used to describe the propagation, is the speciﬁc intensity
(R, ˆk) (if we take into account the polarization of the wave, the speciﬁc intensity
I
can be deﬁned as a Stokes vector or a tensor) which gives the power ﬂux per unit area
and solid angle at the point R which goes in the direction ˆk. In writing a balance
equation on the energy, it is shown that the speciﬁc intensity satisﬁes a Boltzmann
type equation called radiative transfer equation. If the particles are inside a slab with
a permittivity diﬀerent from the surrounding medium, boundary conditions must be
added to the radiative transfer equation in order to calculate the speciﬁc intensity. For
rough surfaces, these boundary conditions are expressed with scattering operators,
where several approximate analytical expressions exist depending on the roughness
of the surface. Numerical calculations of the radiative transfer equation taking into
account rough boundaries can be found in references [7, 12, 17, 18]

permit to take into account the diﬀerent polarizations of the waves.

However, all previous studies on the radiative transfer theory are based on
heuristic principles since in these works, the speciﬁc intensity is a fundamental quantity
which is not deﬁned from the electromagnetic ﬁeld E and B. The link between the
electromagnetism and the classical radiometry theory is due to Walther [19] who has
ﬁrst recognized that the speciﬁc intensity can be deduced from the Wigner function

speciﬁc intensity is not always a positive function, which is in contradiction with the
radiometric interpretation in terms of power. This problem has been the subject of
much study [13, 20, 21] where it has been demonstrated that in the geometrical limit,

cases, the negative value of the speciﬁc intensity are due to interference eﬀects.

As soon as we have determined the relationship between the electromagnetic
ﬁeld and the speciﬁc intensity, we can derive the radiative transfer equation from
the Maxwell equations. The procedure is to write the Maxwell equations in an
integral form with the help of Green functions and to apply the Wigner transform
to the equation derived. Then, in diﬀerentiating this equation we obtain the radiative
transfer equation [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35]. Furthermore, in
starting from the wave equations, we are able to take into account new contributions

to the scattered intensity such as the enhanced backscattering and the correlations
between the scatterers that can not be introduced in the phenomenological radiometric
approach. The objective of this paper is to derive the radiative transfer equation
from the wave equation by taking into account rough boundaries. Several works
have investigated this topics, but they describe the scattering by the rough surfaces
either by using the small-perturbation method [36, 37, 38] or in an unconventional
fashion [39, 40]. In our approach, we use scattering operators which are a versatile
and uniﬁed way to describe how the wave interacts with the boundaries
[41]. To
use these operators, we have introduced two kinds of Green functions (I). The ﬁrst
one GSV (r, r0) describes the ﬁeld scattered by the volume (V), which contains the
scatterers, and by the rough surfaces (S). The second type of Green function is
GS(r, r0), which describes the ﬁeld scattered by a slab with rough boundaries where
the scatterers have been replaced by an homogeneous medium of permittivity ǫe named
eﬀective permittivity. As demonstrated in I, the Green functions GS(r, r0) are easily
expressed as a function of the rough surface scattering operators.
In using these
kind of Green functions, we were able to separate the contribution coming from the
surface and the volume. The main advantage of our approach is that the equations
obtained are similar to the equations generally used to describe the wave scattered by
an inﬁnite random medium [9, 24, 25, 27, 34]. To take into account the boundaries, we
replace the Green function of an inﬁnite homogeneous random medium with GS(r, r0).
Yet, there is a slightly diﬀerence from the classical procedure. Usually, we use the
normalized vector ˆk (
ˆk
= 1) to describe the propagation direction of the wave since

the generalized Dirac function in the speciﬁc intensity
In this study, we will use the two-dimensional vector p = kxˆex + ky ˆez to describe the
propagation direction, and we will recover the vector ˆk by following decomposition:
K0 ˆk = p + aα0(p)ˆez, where α0(p) = (K 2
p2)1/2, and a is the sign of the vertical
component of ˆk (a = sgn(ˆk
ˆez)). This choice, which is unusual for the radiative
transfer theory, is in fact the standard in scattering by rough boundaries where the
vertical axis z has to be diﬀerentiated from the axis x = xˆex + yˆey for a surface
proﬁle deﬁned by z = h(x) [41]. Furthermore, the distinction between upward waves
for a = + and downward waves for a =
is useful to write the boundary conditions.
At the end of this paper, we will explain how to rewrite the equations obtained in the
usual form with ˆk vectors.

2. Cross-section

The geometry of the problem and the notation are described in paper I. In order to
characterize the scattered intensity by an object, we usually introduce the bistatic
cross-section, which is the power scattered per solid angle normalized by the incident
power ﬂux. In this paper, we will use a generalization of this concept called Muller
bistatic cross-section, which permits an accounting for every state of polarization of
the incident and scattered waves. First, as an intermediate of calculation, we have to
introduce the scattering operators describing the ﬁeld scattered by the rough surfaces
and the random media

k Notice that in the paper I, we have introduce the scattering operators describing the ﬁeld scattered
by an homogeneous slab with rough boundaries. However, we can also deﬁne, in the same way,
scattering operators when the medium is inhomogeneous.

In the previous section, we have introduced in a formal way the intensity operator
to write the Bethe-Salpeter equation. This intensity operator can be determined

in using the energy conservation principle.
In fact, by introducing the Dyson
equation, deﬁned in Appendix C, and the Bethe-Salpeter equation (57), in the energy
conservation equation, we obtain a Ward identity which is a relationship between the

In using these equations in the Ward identity, we obtain an expression, called the
which satisﬁes the

transition operator for a scatterer located at rj which takes into account the correlation
with scatterers close to the point rj through the function g(r). Hence, the ﬁrst term
in equation (89) describes the scattering process by one scatterer located at rj, and
the second term represents the interference process between a wave scattered at rj
and another one scattered at rl. We do not reproduce here the derivation of the
Ward identity and equation (89) since the demonstration is formally identical to the
inﬁnite random medium case and is well documented [9, 34, 44, 45]. However, we
must notice that equation (89) is valid only for the static case when the harmonic
dependence ω is the same in the left and right hand sides of the tensorial products of
all equations previously written.
In the dynamic case, the Ward identity contains
a new term, taking into account the time delay that the wave undergoes during
scattering, which modiﬁed equation (89). The derivation of this dynamic Ward
identity and the modiﬁcation on the radiative transfer equation are described in
references [28, 32, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54].

10. Enhanced backscattering and reciprocity

During the last decade, several studies have been concerned with the enhanced
backscattering [9, 13, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, 31, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62]. This phenomenon
produces a peak in the backscattering direction (ˆk =
ˆk0) due to the interference
of waves following the same path but in opposite directions (Figure (3)). The most
elegant way to introduce the enhanced backscattering in the theory is to use the
reciprocity principle [63, 64]. Heuristically, it means that when we exchange the
source and the detector position (respectively given by r0 and r) and also their
polarization, the ﬁeld measured is the same. In using our Green functions, we translate
this statement by

−

G

00
SV (r, r0) = [G

00
SV (r0, r)]T ,

where the transpose of dyad f , which exchanges the polarization,
f

is deﬁned by
00
SV (r, r0) in the ﬁxed basis [ˆex, ˆey, ˆez],

f . If we decompose the dyad G

we re-write equation (179) under the following form:

(181)

The properties in (179) can be demonstrated by using the Green theorem [65]. By
applying these properties on each element of the tensor,

We can easily check that if two of the conditions (182-184) are satisﬁed, the third
condition comes automatically. These properties can be reformulated by using the

It is worth mentioning that to calculate the contribution, we need to know the tensor

transfer equation to calculate the ladder and the crossed terms. The diﬀerence
between the two calculations is the value of P which is the null vector for the ladder
approximation and is given by equation (202) for the crossed contribution.

Nevertheless, this approach is rather unusual, and in this section, we introduce the

12. Simpliﬁcations

So far, we have used the two-dimensional vectors p to described the direction of
propagation. To recover the usual formulation of the radiative transfer theory, we
have to introduced the three-dimensional normalized vector ˆk. For a vector in the
medium 1 such that
e (hence, we neglect the evanescent waves), we have the
||
following relationship between p and ˆk:

ˆk = p

or p = K ′

ˆkz , (224)
where the + and
signs correspond, respectively, to upward and downward waves,
and ˆk⊥ = ˆkxˆex + ˆky ˆey is the projection of the vector ˆk on the plane (Oxy). To
achieve the transformation of p into ˆk, we have, in particular, to express all the factors
involving αe(p
e(p). We
remark that P is diﬀerent from zero only for the enhanced backscattering contribution.
Furthermore, this contribution is important due to the exponential factor in equation

2 ), occurring in the previous equations, as a function of α′

In writing P = 0 in the tensors
P /2), we
impose that in the enhanced backscattering contribution, the direction of propagation
is the same for the two waves which we consider to calculate the intensity. Hence,
the contribution of P appears only in the ﬁrst term of equation (229). In the integral
form of the radiative transfer equation given by equation (134), these simpliﬁcations

15. Link with the scalar approach

In most of the papers devoted to the enhanced backscattering phenomenon, the
polarization and the index mismatch between the scattering medium and the
surrounding medium is often neglected [30, 31, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 69, 70]. We can
recover the expression obtained in this case by replacing the vectorial components
with scalars and the product
with the ordinary product between two complex
f g∗). Without a permittiviy gradient between the scattering
numbers (f
g
⊙
and the surrounding media (ǫ0 = ǫ1 = ǫ2) and if we suppose that the random medium
is sparse (ǫe ≃

ǫ0), we can neglect the reﬂexion at the boundaries, and we have

It can be easily checked that equations (375, 377, 382, 386) are identical to those
obtained by Van der Mark et al. [31, 58] and Tsang et al. [34, 59, 9]. Thus, our
approach is a generalization of the theory developed in the scalar case where the
polarization, the boundaries, the ﬁnite size, and the correlations between the particles
are taken into account. We could also have shown that the equations obtained by
other groups [27, 57, 60, 61, 62, 69, 70, 71, 72] can be recovered by our approach.

16. Conclusion

We have shown how to derive, starting from the Maxwell equations, the radiative
transfer equation and its boundary conditions for a rough inhomogeneous slab. By
using Green functions, we have obtained an integral equation, called the Bethe-
Salpeter equation, on the intensity inside the slab. Then, by applying the Wigner
transform to this equation and by considering the ladder approximation, we have
obtained the integral formulation of the radiative transfer theory. The usual radiative
transfer equation is straightforwardly obtained by diﬀerentiation.

The main goal of this paper was to introduce the boundaries in the derivation of
the radiative transfer equation. We have shown that this could be done by replacing
the Green function for an inﬁnite medium, which describes the propagation between
two scattering events by particles, with the Green functions which take into account
the reﬂexion of the waves by the boundaries. We have, in particular, demonstrated
that the ladder contribution is identical to the phenomenological radiative transfer
theory and satisﬁes boundary conditions that are identical to those derived from
using a geometrical argument [9, 34]. By starting from the Maxwell equations,
we were also able to give an unambiguous deﬁnition of the speciﬁc intensity as a
function of the electric ﬁeld, and thus clarify the meaning of this quantity.
(See
also [35].) Furthermore, we were able to incorporate the correlations between the
scatterers by multiplying the scattering operator of one particle, which appears
in the radiative transfer equation, by a structure factor which is identical to the
one used to describe the scattering of X-rays by crystals. Finally, we have also
incorporated the most crossed contributions in our theory to incorporate the enhanced
backscattering phenomenon. This contribution also satisﬁes a radiative transfer
equation and boundary conditions which are slightly modiﬁed compared to the usual
phenomenological radiative transfer theory.

Appendix C. Mass operator and Dyson equation

In paper I, we have bypassed the introduction of the mass operator and the Dyson

Equation (C.1) is referred as the Dyson equation [9, 13, 24, 25, 34, 56]. The exact
expression of this mass operator is the sum of all the irreducible diagrams that we
can write and which represent the single scattering and all higher scattering process
where recurrent scattering or correlation between scatterers are involved [56, 64]. In
I, we have introduced the Coherent Potential Approximation (CPA) which states that

The factor ǫ0/ǫ′
e accounts for the spreading of the solid angle of the speciﬁc intensity
transmitted from the medium 1 (with the permittivity ǫ′
e) to medium 0 (with
e)1/2
permittivity ǫ0) [6, 16]. Hence, we see that the introduction of the term (ǫ0/ǫ′
in deﬁnition (315) was mandatory to recover the usual expression of the transmission
coeﬃcients. The same reasoning can be applied to justify the introduction of the

Abstract

The generalized Langrangian mean theory provides exact but implicit GLM equa-
tions for general wave-turbulence-mean ﬂow interactions in three dimensions. For
practical applications, explicit but approximate glm2-RANS equations for the mean
pressure and horizontal momentum are derived from the exact GLM equations.
The approximation is obtained under the hypotheses of small surface slope, weak
horizontal gradients of the water depth and mean current, and weak curvature of
the mean current proﬁle. These assumptions yield analytical expressions for the
mean momentum and pressure forcing terms that can be expressed in terms of
the wave spectrum. The glm2-RANS equations are further transformed to yield a
non-divergent mass transport in cartesian coordinates. To lowest order, agreement
is found with Eulerian-mean theories, and the present work provides an extension
of known wave-averaged equations to vertically varying currents or ﬁnite current
values. The accuracy of the approximations is discussed using comparisons with
exact numerical solutions for arbitrary bottom slopes, and an approximate ﬁnite
amplitude wave theory. These suggest that the approximate solutions are proba-
bly accurate for ocean mixed layer modelling and shoaling waves, provided that an
adequate turbulent closure is designed. However, for surf zone applications the ap-
proximations are expected to give only qualitative results due to the large inﬂuence
of wave nonlinearity.

ocean currents and turbulence are well documented (e.g. Battjes 1988, Terray
et al. 1996). The refraction of waves over horizontally varying currents is also
well known, and the modiﬁcations of waves by vertical current shears have
been the topic of a number of theoretical and laboratory investigations (e.g.
Biesel 1950, Peregrine 1976, Kirby and Chen 1989, Swan et al. 2001), and
ﬁeld observations (e.g. Ivonin et al. 2004). In spite of this knowledge and the
importance of the topic for engineering and scientiﬁc applications, ranging
from navigation safety to search and rescue, beach erosion, and de-biasing
of remote sensing measurements, there is no well established and generally
practical numerical model for wave-current interactions in three dimensions.

Indeed the problem is made diﬃcult by the diﬀerence in time scales between
gravity waves and other motions. When motions on the scale of the wave
period can be resolved, Boussinesq approximation of nearshore ﬂows has pro-
vided remarkable numerical solutions of wave-current interaction processes
(e.g. Chen et al. 2003). However, such an approach still misses some of the
important dynamical eﬀect as it cannot represent real vertical current shears
and their mixing eﬀects (Putrevu and Svendsen 1999). This defect has been
partly corrected in quasi-three dimensional models (e.g. Haas et al. 2003), or
multi-layer Boussinesq models (e.g. Lynnett and Liu 2005).

The alternative is of course to use fully three dimensional (3D) models, based
on the primitive equations. These models are extensively used for investigating
the global, regional or coastal ocean circulation (e.g. Bleck 2002), Shchepetkin
and McWilliams 2003). An average over the wave phase or period is most
useful due to practical constraints on the computational resources, allowing
larger time steps and avoiding non-hydrostatic mean ﬂows. Wave-averaging
also allows an easier interpretation of the model result. A summary of wave-
averaged models in 2 or 3 dimensions is provided in table 1.

1.1 Air-water separation

In 3D, problems arise due to the presence of both air and water in the region
between wave crests and troughs. Various approaches to the phase or time
averaging of ﬂow properties are illustrated in ﬁgure 1. For small amplitude
waves, one may simply take a Taylor expansion of mean ﬂow properties (e.g.
McWilliams et al. 2004). Using a decomposition of the non-linear advection
term in the equations of motion u·∇u = ∇u2 + u × ∇u, McWilliams et
al. (2004, see also Lane et al. 2007) obtained a relatively simple set of equa-
tion for conservative wave motion over sheared currents, for a given choice of
small parameters. These parameters include the surface slope ε1 = k0a0 non-
dimensional depth k0h0, with k0, a0 and h0 typical values of the wavenumber,
wave amplitude and water depth, respectively. These authors also assumed

AJB07).

that the current velocity was of the same order as the wave orbital velocity,
both weaker than the phase speed by a factor ε1. That latter assumption may
generally be relaxed since the equations of motion are invariant by a change of
reference frame, so that only the current vertical shear may need to be small
compared to the wave radian frequency, provided that the current, water depth
and wave amplitudes are slowly varying horizontally.

For waves of ﬁnite amplitude, a proper separation of air and water in the
averaged equations of motion requires a change of coordinates that maps the
moving free surface to a level that is ﬁxed, or at least slowly varying. This
is usual practice in air-sea interaction studies, and it has provided approxi-
mate solutions to problems such as wind-wave generation or wave-turbulence
interactions (e.g. Jenkins 1986, Teixeira and Belcher 2002) but it brings some
complications. The most simple change of coordinate was recently proposed
by Mellor (2003), but it appears to be inaccurate in the presence of a bottom
slope (Ardhuin et al., 2007b, hereinafter AJB07).

1.2 Separation of wave and current momentum ﬂuxes

Another approach is to use one of the two sets of exact averaged equations
derived by Andrews and McIntyre (1978a). Groeneweg (1999) successfully
used the second set, the alternative Generalized Lagragian Mean equations

of the (quasi-Eulerian) current and the wave-induced mass transport. In the present
illustration an Airy wave of amplitude 3 m and wavelength 100 m in 30 m depth, is
superimposed on a hypothetical current of velocity u(z) = −0.5 − 0.01z m/s for all
z < ζ(x). The current proﬁle is not represented in (b) since it is not directly given

of current proﬁle modiﬁcations induced by waves (see also Groeneweg and
Klopman 1998, Groeneweg and Battjes 2003). This work was also loosely
adapted for engineering use in the numerical model Delft3D (Walstra et al.

2001).

However, aGLM equations describe the evolution of the total ﬂow momen-
tum, which includes the wave pseudo-momentum per unit mass P. That vec-
tor quantity is generally close to the Lagrangian Stokes drift uS (see below),
and it is not mixed by turbulence, unlike the mean ﬂow momentum. Further,
P is carried by the wave ﬁeld at the group velocity, which is typically one
order of magnitude faster than the drift velocity. Thus bundling P with the
rest of the momentum may lead to large errors with the turbulence closure.
Other practical problems arise due to the strong surface shear of P and uS
(e.g. Rascle et al. 2006) whereas the quasi-Eulerian current is relatively uni-
form in deep water (e.g. Santala and Terray 1992). Thus solving for the total
momentum (including P) requires a high resoltion near the surface. Finally,
a consistent expression of the aGLM equations with a sloping bottom and
wave ﬁeld gradients is diﬃcult due to the divergence of vertical ﬂuxes of mo-
mentum (vertical radiation stresses) that must be expressed to ﬁrst order in
all the small parameters that represent the slow wave ﬁeld evolution (bottom
slope, wave energy gradients, current shears...). This same problem arises with
Mellor’s (2003) equations and is discussed in AJB07.

The ﬁrst set of GLM equations describes the evolution of the quasi-Eulerian
current only, and, just like the decomposition of u·∇u used by McWilliams et
al. (2004), it does not require the evaluation of these vertical radiation stresses.
However, the GLM ﬂow is generally divergent as the averaging operator in-
troduces an implicit change of the vertical coordinate. Further, in order to
be implemented in a numerical model, the wave-induced forcing terms must
be made explicit using approximate solutions for wave-induced motions and
pressure. We will assume that the slowly varying spectrum is known, typically
provided by a wave model. Given the degree of accuracy attained by mod-
elled wave spectra in a wide variety of conditions this is generally appropriate
(e.g. Herbers et al. 2000, Ardhuin et al. 2003, 2007, Magne et al. 2007). We
note in passing that no explicit and theoretically satisfying theory is available
for the transport of the wave action spectrum over vertically and horizontally
sheared currents. Indeed, the exact theory of Andrews and McIntyre (1978b)
is implicit and would require an explicit approximation of the wave action,
similar to the approximation of the wave pseudo-momentum performed here.

The goal of the present paper is to provide a practical and accurate method
for wave-current coupling that is general enough for applications ranging from
the ocean mixed layer to, possibly, the surf zone. GLM equations, for the
reasons listed above, are a good candidate for this application. Although not
as simple as an Eulerian average, the GLM operator is capable of properly
separating air and water in the crest to trough region, leading to physically
accurate deﬁnitions of mean properties on either side of the air-sea interface.
The practical use of GLM requires some approximations and transformations.

We provide in section 2 a derivation of explicit and approximate glm2-RANS
equations. Given the large literature on the subject, we explore in section 3
the relationships between GLM, aGLM and other forms of wave-averaged 3D
and depth-integrated 2D equations. A preliminary analysis of the expected
errors due to the approximations are provided in section 4, and conclusions
follow in section 5. Full numerical solutions will be reported elsewhere.

2.1 Generalities on GLM and linear wave kinematics

We ﬁrst deﬁne the Eulerian average φ (x, t) of φ (x, t), where the average may
be an average over phase, realizations, time t or space. We now take this
average at displaced positions x+ξ, with ξ = (ξ1, ξ2, ξ3) a displacement vector,
and we deﬁning the velocity v at which the mean position is displaced when
the actual position moves at the ﬂuid velocity u(x + ξ). One obtains the
corresponding GLM of φ

L

φ(x, t)

= φ(x + ξ, t)

(1)

by choosing the displacement ﬁeld ξ so that

• the mapping x → x + ξ is invertible
• ξ (x, t) = 0
• v (x, t) = v (x, t), which gives v = u(x, t)

L

.

Such a mapping is illustrated in ﬁgure 1.c for linear waves. Lagrangian per-
turbations are logically deﬁned as the ﬁeld minus its average, i.e.,

l

L

φ(x, t)

= φ(x + ξ, t) − φ(x, t)

= φ(x + ξ, t) − φ(x + ξ, t).

(2)

Here we shall take our Eulerian average to be a phase average 1 . Given any
Eulerian ﬂow ﬁeld u(x, t), one may deﬁne a ﬁrst displacement by

ξ′(x, t, ∆t) =

u(x + ξ′(x, t, t′ − t), t′)dt′.

(3)

t+∆t

Zt

1 For uncorrelated wave components the phase average is obtained by the sum of
the phase averages of each component. In the presence of phase correlations, such
as in the case of partially standing waves or nonlinear phase couplings, the sum has
to be averaged in a coherent manner.

6

The mean drift velocity is deﬁned as v(x, t) = lim∆t→0 ξ′(x, t, ∆t)/(∆t). The
GLM displacement ﬁeld is then given by ξ = ξ′−vt−ξ′ − vt. This construction
of v and ξ guarantees that the required properties are obtained, provided that
the limit ∆t → 0 commutes with the averaging operator. For periodic motions
one may also take v = (ξ′(t + T L) − ξ′(t))/(T L), with T L the Lagrangian wave
period (the time taken by a water particle to return to the same wave phase).
This deﬁnition will be used for Miche waves in section 4.2.

Clearly GLM diﬀers from the Eulerian mean. The diﬀerence between the two
is given by the Stokes correction (Andrews et McIntyre 1978a). Below the
wave troughs, the Stokes correction for the velocity is the Stokes drift, by
deﬁnition,

uS ≡ uL − u.

More generally, for a continuously diﬀerentiable ﬁeld φ the Stokes correction
is given by (Andrews and McIntyre 1978a, equation 2.27),

with an implicit summation over repeated indices and a small dimensionless
parameter ε that deﬁnes the amplitude of ξ.

The GLM average commutes with the Lagrangian derivative, thus the GLM
velocity uL is the average drift velocity of water particles. One should however
be careful that the GLM average does not commute with most diﬀerential op-
erators, for example the curl operator. Indeed the GLM velocity of irrotational
waves is rotational, which is clearly apparent in the vertical shear of the Stokes
drift (see also Ardhuin and Jenkins 2006 for a calculation of the lowest order
mean shears ∂uα/∂z

and ∂u3/∂x

).

One of the interesting aspects of GLM theory is that it clearly separates the
wave pseudo-momentum P from the quasi-Eulerian mean momentum
u =
uL − P. This is a key aspect for numerical modelling since P is transported by
the wave ﬁeld at the group velocity, of the order of 5 m s−1 in deep water, while
u is transported at the much slower velocity uL. P is deﬁned by (Andrews
and McIntyre 1978a, eq. 3.1),

In order to give explicit approximations for the wave-induced eﬀects, we will
approximate the wave motion as a sum of linear wave modes, each with a
local wave phase ψ = k1x1 + k2x2 − ωt, and an intrinsic linear wave radian
, where k = (k1, k2) is the local wavenum-
frequency σ = [gk tanh(kD)]
ber, D is the local mean water depth, and g the acceleration due to gravity
and Earth rotation. Deﬁning h(x1, x2) as the local depth of the bottom and
ζ(x1, x2, t) as the free surface elevation, one has D = ζ + H. We assume
that the wave slope ε1 = max (|∇ζ|) is small compared to unity (this will
be our ﬁrst hypothesis H1), with ∇ denoting the horizontal gradient opera-
tor. We also restrict our investigations to cases for which the Ursell number
is small Ur = (a/D)/(kD)2 < 1 (this is hypothesis H2). We further restrict
our derivations to ﬁrst order in the slow spatial scale ε2. That small parame-
ter may be deﬁned as the maximum of the slow spatial scales |(∂a/∂x)/(ka)|,
u/∂t)/(σ)2, and
|(∂u/∂x)/(σ)|, |(∂D/∂x)|, and time scales |(∂a/∂t)/(σa)|, |k(∂
|(∂D/∂t)k/σ| (hypothesis H3). It will also appear that the current proﬁle may
cause some diﬃculties. Since we have already assumed a small wave steepness
we may use Kirby and Chen’s (1989) results, giving the dispersion relation

where α is a dummy index representing any horizontal component 1 or 2, and
the summation is implicit over repeated indices. The index 3 will represent the
vertical components positive upwards, along the direction z = x3. In particular
we shall assume that their correction to the lowest order stream function
(their eq. 23) is relatively small, which may be obtained by requiring that the
curvature of the current is weak or concentrated in a thin boundary layer, i.e.
ε3 ≪ 1 (hypothesis H4) with

Thus the GLM of vertical positions in the water is generally larger than the
Eulerian mean of the position of the same particles (see also McIntyre 1988).
This is easily understood by noticing that there are more particles under
the crests than under the troughs (ﬁgure 1.c). As a result, the original GLM
equations are divergent (∇·uL 6= 0) and require a coordinate transformation

10

to yield a non-divergent velocity ﬁeld. That transformation is always small,
of order ε2
1. That transformed set of equation is a modiﬁed primitive equation
that may be implemented in existing ocean circulation models.

The vertical wave pseudo-momentum P3 = 0 is, at most, of order σ/kε3 and
may be neglected in the present context. The horizontal component Pα diﬀers
from the Stokes drift uS
α due to the current vertical shear. Therefore the quasi-

2.1.1 glm2-RANS equations

The velocity ﬁeld is assumed to have a unique decomposition in mean, wave
u + u′, with hu′i = 0, the average over
and turbulent components u = u +
the ﬂow realizations for prescribed wave phases. The turbulence will be as-
e
sumed weak enough so that its eﬀect on the sea surface position is negligible.
We note X the divergence of the Reynolds stresses, i.e. Xi = ∂
/∂xj,
and we apply the GLM average to the Reynolds-Average Navier-Stokes equa-
tions (RANS). We shall now seek an approximation to the GLM momentum
equations by retaining all terms of order ρwgε3 and larger in the horizontal
momentum equation, and all terms of order ρwgε2 in the vertical momen-
tum equation. The resulting equations, that may be called the ”glm2-RANS”
equations, are thus more limited than the Eulerian mean equations of MRL04,
except that here random waves are considered and that the mean current may
be larger than the wave orbital velocity. Indeed we make no hypothesis on
the current magnitude, but only on the horizontal current gradients and on
the curvature of the current proﬁle. The present derivation diﬀers from that
of Groeneweg (1999) by the fact that we use the GLM instead of the aGLM
equations (see table 1).

These exact equations will now be approximated using (10)-(15). We ﬁrst
evaluate the wave forcing terms in (25) using monochromatic waves, with a
surface elevation variance E = a2/2. The result for random waves follows by
summation over the spectrum and replacing E with the spectral density E(k).

We ﬁrst consider the vertical momentum balance, giving the pressure ﬁeld. It
should be noted that the Lagrangian mean Bernoulli head term ul

The turbulent closure is the topic of ongoing research and will not be explicitly
detailed here. We only note that it diﬀers in principle from the closure of the
aGLM equations of Groeneweg (1999), which could be extended to include
the second term in eq. (26). A proper closure involves a full discussion of the
distortion of turbulence by the waves when the turbulent mixing time scale
is larger than the wave period (e.g. Walmsley and Taylor 1996, Janssen 2004,
Teixeira and Belcher 2002). One should consider with caution the rather bold
but practical assumptions of Groeneweg (1999) who used a standard turbu-
lence closure to deﬁne the viscosity that acts upon the wave-induced velocities,
or the assumption of Huang and Mei (2003) who assumed that the eddy vis-
cosity instantaneously adjusts to the passage of waves. These eﬀects may have
consequences on the magnitude of wave attenuation through its interaction
Xα. Here we only note
with turbulence, and the resulting vertical proﬁle of
that any momentum lost by the wave ﬁeld should be gained by either the
atmosphere, the bottom or the mean ﬂow. Thus a possible parameterization
for the diabatic source of momentum is

with Rαβ the horizontal Reynolds stress, and Kz a vertical eddy viscosity,
while the last three terms correspond to the dissipative momentum ﬂux from
waves to the mean ﬂow, through whitecapping, wave-turbulence interactions,
and bottom friction. Although the momentum lost by the waves via bot-
tom friction was shown to eventually end up in the bottom (Longuet-Higgins
2005), the intermediate acceleration of the mean ﬂow, also known as Eulerian
streaming, is important for sediment transport, and should be included with a
vertical proﬁle of T bfric
concentrated near the bottom, provided that the wave
boundary layer is actually resolved in the 3D model (e.g. Walstra et al. 2001).

2.2 glm2-RANS equations in z-coordinates

Equations (41) and (43) hold from z = −h to z = ζ
, which covers the entire
‘GLM water column’. All terms in (41) are deﬁned as GLM averages, except
for the hydrostatic pressure pH. This oddity may be corrected by deﬁning a
GLM hydrostatic pressure, i.e., the hydrostatic pressure at the mean GLM
position of water particles,

L

pLH = pH − ρwgξ

L
3 .

For practical numerical modelling, it is however preferable that the height of
the water column does not change with the local wave height. We will thus
transform eq. (41) by correcting for the GLM-induced vertical displacements.
This will naturally remove the divergence of the GLM ﬂow related to J 6= 1.

When the presence of air is considered, it should be noted that the GLM posi-
tion is discontinuous in the absence of viscosity, because the Stokes corrections
for ζ have opposite signs in the air and in the water. This discontinuity arises
from the discontinuity of the horizontal displacement ξα (air and water wave-
induced motions are out of phase). A proper treatment would therefore require
to resolve the viscous boundary layer at the free surface. This question is left
for further investigation. However, we note that due to the large wind veloc-
ities and possibly large surface currents unrelated to wave motions, a good
approximation is given by neglecting the Stokes corrections for the horizontal
air momentum,

The viscous term was estimated using the GLM average of wave orbital shears
(Ardhuin and Jenkins 2006), it is the well-known virtual wave stress (e.g. Xu
and Bowen 1994, eq. 18). That stress corresponds to wave momentum lost due
to viscous dissipation, and it can be absorbed into the boundary conditions
because it is concentrated within a few millimeters from the surface (Banner
et Peirson 1998). At the base of the viscous layer of thickness δs, (63) yields,
using an eddy viscosity Kz,

If an adherence condition is speciﬁed at the bottom, which shall be used be-
L
= h. It may also
low, the bottom boundary condition further simpliﬁes as h
simplify under the condition that the wave amplitude is not correlated with
the small scale variations of h, which is not generally the case (e.g. Ardhuin
and Magne 2007). For the dynamic boundary conditions, pressure-slope cor-
relations give rise to a partial reﬂection of waves, that may be represented
by a scattering stress (e.g. Hara and Mei 1987, Ardhuin and Magne 2007).
This stress modiﬁes the wave pseudo-momentum without any change of wave
action (see also Ardhuin 2006).

The eﬀect of bottom friction is of considerable interest for sediment dynamics
and deserves special attention. For the sake of simplicity, we shall here use the

19

conduction solution of Longuet-Higgins for a constant viscosity over a ﬂat sea
bed as given in the appendix to the proceedings of Russel and Osorio (1958).
We shall brieﬂy consider waves propagating along the x-axis, and we assume
that the mean current in the wave bottom boundary layer (WBBL) is at most
of the order of the wave orbital velocity outside of the WBBL. Instead of
(11)–(15) the orbital wave velocity and displacements near the bottom take
the form,

Generalizing this approach to a turbulent bottom boundary layer (e.g. Longuet-

eddy viscosity. If the wave bottom boundary layer (WBBL) is resolved, τ b
α will
also include the momentum lost by waves through bottom friction, as given
by the depth-integral of T bfric
. One may estimate P from the vertical proﬁles
w, and the modiﬁed pressure (37) has
uα and
of the wave orbital velocities
to be corrected for the change in wave orbital velocities in the WBBL. Many

WBBL models are available for estimating these wave-induced quantities.

If the bottom boundary layer is not resolved, on may take the lowest model
level at the top of the wave boundary layer. The bottom stress may then be
computed from a parameterization of the bottom roughness z0a′ (e.g. Mathisen

Finally, the quasi-Eulerian volume ﬂux is deﬁned by Mm = M − Mw.

For terms uniform over the depth (∂pH /∂xα and ∂SJ/∂xα) the integral is

The source of momentum X int is simply the sum of the mean momentum
ﬂuxes at the top and bottom, and the source of momentum due to diabatic
wave-mean ﬂow interactions (i.e. breaking and wave-turbulence interactions).

These equations slightly diﬀer from those of Smith (2006, eq. 2.24), with all
diﬀerences related to the current shear. In the absence of shear, m = 1 and
SJ equals the J term of Smith (2006), thus the corresponding wave-induced
forces are equal. Further, the advection velocity uA0α replaces Smith’s mean
ﬂow velocity. Since uA0α is the proper lowest order advection velocity for the
wave action (Andrews and McIntyre 1978b), this is a simple extension of
Smith’s result to depth-varying currents. The term involving Sshear is also
obviously absent from Smith’s equations. The last diﬀerence is the extra term

absence of Stokes drift in his surface kinematic boundary condition.

3.2 Equations of McWilliams et al. (2004)

The approach of MRL04 is in the line of perturbation theories presented by
Mei (1989) for Eulerian variables and monochromatic waves. Although the
result of MRL04 corresponds to a particular choice of the relative ordering of
small parameters, it is given to a high enough order so that it does cover most
situations at a lower order. In particular MRL04 have pushed the expansion to
order ε4
1 for some terms because they assumed a ratio σ/f3 of order ε4
1, with ε1
the wave slope. This ratio, in practice, may only be attained for exceptionally
steep waves. They also assumed that ε2
1 ∼ ε2 (the wave envelope varies on
a scale relatively much larger than the wavelength compared to the present
theory in which ε1 ∼ ε2 is possible). These authors also separated the motion
into waves, long waves and mean ﬂow, and considered in detail the rotational
part of the wave motion caused by the vertical shear of the current.

MRL04 thus obtained Eulerian-mean equations that are strictly valid under

23

the level of the wave troughs. We shall neglect here their terms of order ε4
1 (i.e.
terms that involve the wave amplitude to the power of four), which amounts
to choosing a slightly diﬀerent scaling. This avoids cumbersome considerations
of the wave bispectrum when the equations are generalized to random waves.

The Eulerian-mean variables of MRL04 should be related to the Lagrangian
mean values by the Stokes corrections (5), so that their horizontal Eulerian-
mean velocity q is equal to uL − uS. Because they have subtracted the hy-
drostatic pressure with the mean water density ρw0, their mean pressure hpi
should be equal to the Eulerian mean pressure p + ρw0gz, with p related to
the GLM pressure via eq. (36).

Absorbing the long waves in the mean ﬂow (i.e. allowing the mean ﬂow to vary
on a the wave group scale), MRL04 equations for the mean velocity (q1, q2, wt)
can be written as

The original notations of MRL04 (see also Lane et al. 2007) have been trans-

Besides, we have deﬁned the vertical velocity wt by adding to their suppos-
edly Eulerian-mean velocity w the pseudo vertical Stokes drift wSt that makes

so that wt is the true Eulerian-mean velocity. As a result the second term
in Jα in MRL04’s eq. (9.20) has been combined with the vertical advection
w∂qα/∂z to yield a vertical advection with the true Eulerian velocity wt.

b

These equations are clearly analogue to the glm2-RANS equations presented
here. In particular the vertical vortex force term K corresponds to our K1
that gets into Sshear, and the dynamically relevant kinematic pressure pressure
hpi + K1 + K2 corresponds to our pressure
p deﬁned by (37). There are only
two diﬀerences. One is between the surface boundary conditions for these two
pressures, with a diﬀerence only due to K2(z = 0) 6= −K2(ζ
). Integrating
by parts to estimate K2(z = 0), this diﬀerence is found to be of the order of
gkEε3. Such a diﬀerence is of the same order as extra terms that would arise
when using wave kinematics to ﬁrst order in the current curvature (Kirby and
u in u. The second diﬀerence between
Chen 1989), and properly transforming
MRL04 and the present equations is that the wave pseudo-momentum P diﬀers
from the Stokes drift uS when the current shear is large, and both generally
diﬀer from the expression for uS given by MRL04. Since MRL04 took the
current and wave orbital velocity to be of the same order, in that context the
diﬀerence P − uS is of higher order and thus the two sets of equations are
consistent in their common range of validity.

b

L

A general comparison of 2D depth-integrated equations is discussed by Lane
et al. (2006). The present work therefore brings a further veriﬁcation of their
3D form of the equations, and an extension to relatively strong currents, pos-
sibly as large as the phase velocities. As expected, the Eulerian averages of
McWilliams et al. (2004) are identical to the quasi-Eulerian ﬁelds in GLM
theory, because they obey the same equations, except for current proﬁle cur-
vature eﬀects, which were partly neglected here. The ”Eulerian” mean current
of MRL04 can thus be physically interpreted as a quasi-Eulerian average, de-
ﬁned as the GLM average minus the wave pseudo-momentum. Except for a
Jacobian that introduces relative corrections of second order in the wave slope,
this averaging is identical to the procedure used by Swan et al. (2001). Above
the trough level, this average should not be confused with a truly Eulerian
average, as obtained from in-situ measurements for example. In such mea-
surements the Stokes drift would be recorded in the trough-to-crest region.

4 Limitations of the approximations

The glm2-RANS equations have been obtained from the exact GLM equations,
under 6 restricting hypotheses related to the wave slope and Ursell number
(H1 and H2), the horizontal scales of variation of the wave amplitude (H3),
the current proﬁle (H4 and H5) and the vertical mean velocity (H6). These
hypotheses essentially allowed us to use the linear wave-induced quantities
given by eqs. (11)–(19). In practical conditions, these hypotheses may not be
veriﬁed and the resulting glm2-RANS equations may have to be modiﬁed.
Here we investigate the importance of H3 and H1, using numerical solutions
from an accurate coupled mode model for irrotational wave propagation over
any bottom topography, and an approximate analytical solution for incipient
breaking waves, respectively.

4.1 Bottom slope and standing waves

In absence of dissipation and given proper lateral boundary conditions the
ﬂow in wave shoaling over a bottom slope is irrotational and can thus be
obtained by a numerical exact solution of Laplace’s equation with bottom,
surface, and lateral boundary conditions. For waves of small amplitudes this
can be provided by a solution to this system of equations to second order
in the wave slope. Belibassakis and Athanassoulis (2002) have developed the
NTUA model to solve this problem. Here we apply their model to the simple
case of monochromatic, unidirectional waves propagating along the x axis,
with a topography uniform along the y axis. The topography h(x) varies only
for 0 < x < L and is constant h(x) = h1 for x < 0 and h(x) = h2 for x > L.
In that case the Eulerian mean current ∇φ0(x) is irrotational, and uniform
over the vertical as x approaches ±∞ (e.g. Belibassakis and Athanassoulis
2002, table 1 and ﬁgure 5). We shall further restrict our investigation to the
case of a monochromatic wave train of known radian frequency ω and incident
amplitude a, giving rise to reﬂected and transmitted wave trains of amplitudes
Ra and T a. Numerical calculations are given for a bottom proﬁle as given by
Roseau (1976) for which the reﬂection coeﬃcient R is known analytically, thus
providing a check on the quality of the numerical solution.

The bottom is deﬁned here by x and z coordinates given by the real and
imaginary part of the complex parametric function of the variable x′,

Z(x′) = x + iz =

h1(x′ − iα0) + (h2 − h1) ln(1 + ex′−iα0)
α0

.

(95)

We choose h1 = 6 m and h2 = 4 m and a wave frequency of 0.19 Hz (ω =

26

1.2 rad s−1). For α0 = 15π/180 the maximum bottom slope is ε2 = 2.6 × 10−2
(ﬁgure 1), and the reﬂection coeﬃcient for wave amplitude is R = 1.4 × 10−9
(Roseau 1976), so that reﬂected waves may be neglected in the momentum
balance. Due to the shoaling of the incident waves, the mass transport induced

mentum (here equal to the Stokes drift) in waves with amplitude a = 0.12 m, over
the bottom given by eq. (95).

by the waves increases in shallow water, and thus the mean current must
change in the x direction to compensate for the divergence in the wave-induced

27

mass transport. We shall further take a zero-mean surface elevation as x →
−∞. The second order mean elevation is obtained as a result of the model.

For mild bottom slopes, the reﬂection coeﬃcient is small as predicted by
Roseau (1976). The NTUA model used here generally gives accurate reﬂection
coeﬃcients, but it tends to overestimate very weak reﬂections. In the ﬁrst case
investigated here, the numerical reﬂection is R = 1 × 10−3, with no signiﬁcant
eﬀect on the wave dynamics. The NTUA model is used to provide the Fourier
amplitudes of the mean, ﬁrst and second harmonic components of the veloc-
ity potential, over a grid of 401 (horizontal) by 101 (vertical) points. From
these discretized potential ﬁelds, the mean, ﬁrst and second harmonic veloc-
ity components are obtained using second order centered ﬁnite diﬀerences. As
expected, the numerical solution gives a horizontal mean ﬂow u that compen-
sates the divergence of the wave mass transport and is thus of order σ/kε2.
Further u is almost uniform over the vertical and is irrotational (ﬁgure 2.b).
The vertical mean velocity is of higher order. The GLM momentum balance
is thus dominated by the hydrostatic and dynamic pressure terms pH and SJ.
Although these two terms are individually of the order of 0.01 m2 s−2, their
sum is less than 2 × 10−16 m2 s−2 in the entire domain, at the roundoﬀ error
level. It thus appears that this part of the momentum balance is much more
accurate than expected from the asymptotic expansion. Indeed, for any bot-
tom slope, in the limit of small surface slopes and for irrotational ﬂow and
periodic waves, the Stokes correction (5) for the pressure and the time aver-
age of the Bernoulli equation give the following expression for the modiﬁed
kinematic pressure (37)

where the equalities only hold to second order in the surface slope. Thus the
p has no dynamical eﬀect to second order in the
kinematic modiﬁed pressure
wave slope, as already discussed by McWilliams et al. (2004) and Lane et al.
(2007). For irrotational ﬂow, this remains true for any bottom topography
and even for rapidly varying wave amplitudes, including variations on scales
shorter than the wavelength.

b

Thus the only wave eﬀect is the static change in mean water level (set-up or
set-down), and dynamic consequences in the WBBL, where SJ goes to zero,
leaving the hydrostatic pressure gradient to drive a mean ﬂow that can only
be balanced by bottom friction. For slowly varying wave amplitude the mean

Equation (97) is well veriﬁed by the NTUA result for the case considered so
far (ﬁgure 3.a). However, this is no longueur true for rapid variations in the
wave amplitude a(x), i.e. due to partially standing waves. In that case one
should use Longuet-Higgins’ eq. D (op. cit.)

with
Miche’s (1944a) mean sea level solution under standing waves. Contrary to
propagating wave groups, for which the mean sea level is depressed under
large waves, here the depression occurs at the nodes of the standing wave,
where the horizontal velocities are largest and amplitudes are smallest (ﬁgure
3.c).

e

Eq. (98) is well veriﬁed in the presence of partially standing waves. To il-
lustrate this, we have modiﬁed the bottom topography, adding a sinusoidal
bottom perturbation for x > 180 m with an amplitude of 5 cm and a bot-
tom wavelength half of the local waves’ wavelength, which maximizes wave
reﬂection (Kreisel 1949). This yields a wave amplitude reﬂection R = 0.03, for
ω = 1.2 rad s−1, of the order of observed wave reﬂections over gently sloping
beaches (e.g. Elgar et al. 1994). The bottom is shown on ﬁgure 3.b. Although
the standing wave pattern is hardly noticeable in the surface elevation (the
amplitude modulation is only 6%, ﬁgure 3.c), it dominates the local gradients
of the hydrostatic pressure (ﬁgure 3.d), thus dominating the momentum bal-
ance in the WBBL (see Longuet-Higgins 1953, Yu and Mei 2000 for solutions
obtained with constant viscosity).

In the presence of such standing waves, and in the absence of strong wave dis-
sipation, the hydrostatic pressure on the scale of the standing waves (e.g. given
by Miche 1944a) drives the ﬂow in the WBBL towards the nodes of the stand-
ing wave (Longuet-Higgins 1953), and is balanced by bottom friction. This
WBBL ﬂow drives an opposite ﬂow above, closing a secondary circulation
cell. This secondary circulation is important for nearshore sediment transport
just outside of the surf zone (Yu and Mei 2000). If these sub-wavelength circu-
lations are to be modelled, the present glm2-RANS theory should be extended

to resolve the momentum balance on the scale of partial standing waves. This
extension is relatively simple as it only introduces additional standing wave
terms in all quadratic wave-related quantities, arising from phase-couplings of
the incident and reﬂected waves. This extension provides a generalization of
eq. (98) in the presence of other processes.

4.2 Eﬀects of wave non-linearity

Deep or intermediate water waves do not break very often in most conditions
(e.g. Banner et al. 2000, Babanin et al. 2001), thus the particular kinematics
of breaking waves likely contributes little to the average forcing of the current.
However, most of the waves break in the surf zone and deviations from Airy
wave kinematics may introduce a systematic bias when the glm2-RANS equa-
tions are applied in that context. Many wave theories have been developed

that are generally more accurate than the Airy wave theory (e.g. Dean 1970).
However, they may lack some realistic features found in breaking waves, such
as sharp crests. In order to explore the magnitude of this bias, we shall use
the kinematics of two-dimensional incipient breaking waves as given by the
approximate theory of Miche (1944b).

e

e

Miche’s theory is based on the asymptotic expansion of the potential ﬂow
from the triangular crest of a steady breaking wave, extending Stokes’ 120◦
corner ﬂow to ﬁnite depth. From this Miche obtained his criterion for the max-
imum steepness of a steady breaking wave, i.e. h/λ = 0.14 tanh(kh) with h the
breaking wave height and L the wavelength, which favorably compares with
observations. The Miche wave potential φ and streamfunction
ψ are expressed
implicitly as a function G of the coordinates x − xc + i(z − zc), with origin on
the wave crest (xc, zc). The coeﬃcients in the series representing the reciprocal
function G′ are obtained from the boundary condition at the surface and bot-
tom. Unfortunately, these are imposed only under the wave crest and trough,
so that the bottom streamline may not be horizontal away from the crest. This
is particularly true for small values of kh. Due to the expansion of G′ in powers
of φ + i
ψ, the shape of the wave is still expected to be accurate near the crest
and worthy of investigation. The function G′ was modiﬁed here to make the
bottom actually ﬂat, and the vertical under the trough an equipotential. This
deformation adds a weak rotational component to the motion and the wave
streamlines are most strongly modiﬁed at the bottom under the wave trough.
The resulting wave for kh = 0.58 (corresponding to b = 1 in Miche 1944b)
is shown in ﬁgure 4.a. A numerical evaluation of that solution is obtained at
201 equally spaced values of ψ and 401 equally spaced values of φ (ﬁgure 4.b).
The GLM displacement ﬁeld ξ is computed as described in section 2.1. Since
the streamlines are known in the frame of reference of the wave, Lagrangian
positions of 201 particles initially placed below the crest at xi(0) = 0, were
tracked over four Eulerian wave periods. The positions (xi(t), zi(t)) are given
by the potential φi(t) and streamfunction ψi. The Lagrangian period for each
particle T L
is determined by detecting the ﬁrst time when the particles pass
i
under the crest again. The Lagrangian mean velocity of each particle is then
xi(T L
zi(t)dt. This
deﬁnes the Lagrangian mean velocity uL(zi) in GLM coordinates. Following
the coordinate transformation in section 2, we further transform the GLM
velocity proﬁle to z coordinate (ﬁgure 4.c). The resulting proﬁle of uL has a
horizontal tangent at z = 0, as discussed by Miche (1944b).

R

Contrary to Miche (1944b) who deﬁned the phase speed C of his wave by
imposing a zero mass transport, we have deﬁned C so that P = uL with the
pseudo-momentum P estimated from eq. (7) using ﬁnite diﬀerences applied to
the displacement ﬁeld. The two proﬁles of P, estimated from eq. (7), and uL,
estimated by time integration of particle positions coincide almost perfectly.
Thus the estimation of P provides a practical method for separating the mean

31

current from the wave motion. Starting from any value of C, the diﬀerence
between uL and P is the mean current velocity
u. Here C was corrected to
have

u = 0.

L

From ξ, Bernoulli’s equation can be used to obtain the GLM of velocities and
pressure. Compared to linear wave theory, the Stokes drift in a Miche wave is
much more sheared. It should be noted that in the cnoidal theory investigated
by Wiegel (1959) this drift velocity is depth-uniform. Thus cnoidal wave the-
ories may produce inaccurate results for 3D wave-current interactions when
extrapolated to breaking waves. This marked diﬀerence in the 3D mean ﬂow
forcing due to breaking waves compared to linear waves calls for a deeper
investigation of this question. Accurate wave kinematics theories or measure-
ments, may provide a rationale for the parameterization of nonlinearity in the

32

glm2-RANS equations proposed here.

5 Conclusion

We have approximated the exact Generalized Lagrangian Mean (GLM) wave-
averaged momentum equations of Andrews and McIntyre (1978a), to second
order in the wave slope, allowing for strong and sheared mean currents with
limited curvature in the current proﬁle. These approximated equations were
then transformed by a change of the vertical coordinate, giving a non-divergent
GLM ﬂow in z coordinates. The resulting conservation equations for mass
and horizontal momentum (53) and (55), with boundary conditions (58)–(73)
may be solved using slightly modiﬁed versions of existing primitive equations
models, forced with the results of spectral wave models. Although the quasi-
Eulerian current that is now computed is divergent, due to the wave-induced
mass transport, this aspect can be treated properly. Indeed, the HYCOM
model (Bleck 2002) was modiﬁed by R. Baraille to solve a simpliﬁed set of
equations, retaining only the wave-induced mass transport in both the mass
and momentum equations, and the tracer equation (in which the advection
velocity is simply uL, see also MRL04). This work was applied to the a hindcast
of the trajectories of sub-surface oil pellets released by the tanker Prestige-
Nassau, which sank oﬀ Northwest Spain in November 2002 (presentation at
the 2004 WMO-JCOMM ‘Oceanops’ conference held in Toulouse, France).
The full equations derived here have also been implemented in the ocean
circulation model ROMS (Shchepetkin and McWilliams 2003), and results will
be reported elsewhere. The equations presented here have also been applied
for the modelling of the ocean mixed layer in horizontally-uniform conditions
(Rascle et al. 2006).

Although a general expression for the turbulent closure has been given, it has
not been made explicit in terms of the wave and mean ﬂow quantities beyond a
heuristic closure that combines an eddy viscosity mixing term with the known
sources of momentum due to wave dissipation. A proper turbulent closure
is left for further work, possibly extending and combining the approaches of
Groeneweg and Klopman (1998), with those of Teixeira and Belcher (2002).
Further, some wave forcing quantities have been expressed in terms of the
Eulerian mean current u instead of the quasi-Eulerian mean current
u. The
conversion from one to the other, can be done using eq. (24), to the order of
approximation used here.

b

Beyond the turbulence closure, there are essentially two practical limitations
to the approximate glm2-RANS equations derived here. First, the expansion
of wave quantities to second order in the surface slope is only qualitative in
the surf zone. Although this was acceptable in two dimensions (see Bowen

33

1969 and most of the literature on this subject), it is expected to be insuﬃ-
cient in three dimensions due to a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the proﬁle of the
wave-induced drift velocity P, which exhibits a vertical shear several times
larger than predicted by linear wave theory for kh < 1. This conclusion is
based on the approximate theory of Miche (1944b) and further investigations
using more accurate depictions of the kinematics of breaking waves will be
needed, possibly leading to a parameterization of these eﬀects. Second, the
vertical proﬁle of the mean current in the surf zone may be such that the
wave kinematics are not well described by the approximations used here. A
strong nonlinearity combined with a strong current shear and curvature can
lead to markedly diﬀerent wave kinematics (e.g. da Silva and Peregrine 1988).

With these caveats, the equations derived here provide a generalization of
existing equations, extending Smith (2006) to three dimensions and vertically
sheared currents, or McWilliams et al. (2004) to strong currents. Of course,
mean ﬂow equations can be obtained, at least numerically, using any solution
for the wave kinematics with the original exact GLM equations, as illustrated
in section 4.2. The wave-forcing on the mean ﬂow is a vortex force plus a
modiﬁed pressure, a decomposition that allows a clearer understanding of the
wave-current interactions, compared to the more traditional radiation stress
form. This is most important for the three-dimensional momentum balance
and/or in the presence of strong currents, e.g. when a rip current is widened
by opposing waves, as observed by Ismail and Wiegel (1983) in the laboratory.
Such a situation was also recently modelled by Shi et al. (2006).

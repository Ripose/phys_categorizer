Large-Eddy Simulation of Stably Stratiﬁed Atmospheric Boundary Layer
Turbulence: A Scale-Dependent Dynamic Modeling Approach

ABSTRACT

A new tuning-free subgrid-scale model, termed ‘locally-averaged scale-dependent dynamic’ (LASDD)
model, is developed and implemented in large-eddy simulations (LESs) of stable boundary layers. The new
model dynamically computes the Smagorinsky coefﬁcient and the subgrid-scale Prandtl number based on the
local dynamics of the resolved velocity and temperature ﬁelds. Overall, the agreement between the statistics
of the LES-generated turbulence and some well-established empirical formulations and theoretical predictions
(e.g., Nieuwstadt’s local scaling hypothesis) is remarkable. The results show clear improvements over most of
the traditional subgrid-scale models in the surface layer. Moreover, in contrast to previous large-eddy simulations
of stable boundary layers that have strong dependence on grid resolution, the simulated statistics obtained with
the LASDD model show relatively little resolution dependence for the range of grid sizes considered here. In
essence, we show that the new LASDD model is a robust subgrid-scale parameterization for reliable, tuning-free
simulations of stable boundary layers, even with relatively coarse resolutions.

1. Introduction

Atmospheric boundary layers (ABLs) are usually classi-
ﬁed into three types: neutral, convective and stable, based
on atmospheric stability (buoyancy effects) and the domi-
nant mechanism of turbulence generation (Stull 1988; Arya
2001). The boundary layer becomes stably stratiﬁed when-
ever the underlying surface is colder than the air. Under this
atmospheric condition, turbulence is generated by shear and
destroyed by negative buoyancy and viscosity. Because of
this competition between shear and buoyancy effects, the
strength of turbulence in the stable boundary layer (SBL)
is much weaker in comparison to the neutral and convec-
tive boundary layers. As a result, the stable boundary layer
is also much shallower and characterized by smaller eddy
motions. Stable boundary layer turbulence has not received
much attention despite its scientiﬁcally intriguing nature and
practical signiﬁcance (e.g., numerical weather prediction –
NWP, and pollutant transport). This might be attributed to
the lack of adequate ﬁeld or laboratory measurements, to
the inevitable difﬁculties in numerical simulations (arising
from small scales of motion due to stratiﬁcation) and to the
intrinsic complexity in its dynamics (e.g., occurrences of
intermittency, Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, gravity waves,
low-level jets, meandering motions etc.) (Hunt et al. 1996;

nesota, Minneapolis, MN 55414 (basus@msi.umn.edu)

Mahrt 1998; Derbyshire 1999). Not surprisingly, today,
there is a general consensus among researchers that our un-
derstanding of the stable boundary layer (especially the very
stable regime) is quite poor (Mahrt 1998; Derbyshire 1999;
Holtslag 2003) and ‘even small future advances justify more
work’

(Mahrt 1998).

In order to improve our understanding of SBL turbulence
and to explore some of its inherent characteristics, in this
study we make use of a contemporary numerical modeling
approach, known as large-eddy simulation. Following the
pioneering works of Deardorff (Deardorff 1970, 1972, 1974, 1980)
over the years LES has become an indispensable tool to
study the ABL (e.g., Moeng 1984; Nieuwstadt et al. 1991;
Andr´en et al. 1994; Mason 1994; Sullivan et al. 1994;
Kosovi´c 1997; Albertson and Parlange 1999; Port´e-Agel
et al. 2000; Beare et al. 2004). However, until now LES
models have not been sufﬁciently faithful in reproducing
the characteristics of moderately and strongly stable atmo-
spheric boundary layers (Saiki et al. 2000; Holtslag 2003).
The main weakness of LES is associated with our limited
ability to accurately account for the dynamics that are not
explicitly resolved in the simulations. Under stable condi-
tions – due to ﬂow stratiﬁcation – the characteristic size of
the eddies becomes increasingly smaller with increasing at-
mospheric stability, which eventually imposes an additional
burden on the LES subgrid-scale (SGS) models. The re-
cent GABLS (Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment
Atmospheric Boundary Layer Study) LES intercomparison

study (Beare et al. 2004) highlights that LESs of moderately
stable BLs are quite sensitive to SGS models at a relatively
ﬁne resolution of 6.25 m. At a coarser resolution (12.5 m),
a couple of commonly used SGS models even laminarized
spuriously. Occasionally, laminarization was manifested by
a near-linear (without any curvature) temperature proﬁle; at
times the SGS contributions to the total momentum or heat
ﬂuxes were larger than ﬁfty percent in the interior of the
boundary layer. This breakdown of traditional SGS mod-
els undoubtedly calls for improved SGS parameterizations
in order to make LES a more reliable tool to study stable
boundary layers. The present study is devoted towards this
goal.

The organization of this paper is as follows. In Section
2, we brieﬂy describe the basic philosophy of large-eddy
simulation. The newly developed locally-averaged scale-
dependent dynamic (LASDD) SGS modeling approach is
presented in Section 3. Simulations of stably stratiﬁed atmo-
spheric boundary layers are presented in Section 4. Lastly,
in Section 5, we summarize our research and elaborate on
the prospects for future research in this subject area.

The effects of the unresolved scales (smaller than ∆f ) on
the evolution of ˜ui and ˜θ appear in the SGS stress τij (see

Note that the SGS stress and ﬂux quantities are unknown and

the resolved velocity and temperature ﬁelds.

Eddy-viscosity models, the most popular SGS models,
use the ‘gradient hypothesis’ and formulate the ij-component

for numerical solution (LES) on a grid of mesh size ∆g, con-
siderably larger than the smallest scale of turbulent motion
(the so-called Kolmogorov scale). It is common practice to
use the ratio of ﬁlter-width to grid-spacing, ∆f /∆g = 1 or
2 [see the Chapter 9 of Geurts (2003) for detailed discussion
on this ratio and its impact on error dynamics]. In this study,
we use a ratio of 2.

is the resolved strain rate tensor and νt denotes the eddy-
viscosity. It is well-known that the eddy-viscosity SGS mod-
els give a poor prediction of the SGS stresses on a local
level (see Sarghini et al. 1999; Meneveau and Katz 2000;
Geurts 2003.) Their underlying assumption of strain rates
being aligned with the SGS stress tensor is unrealistic (see
Higgins et al. 2003 and the references therein). Further-
more, these SGS models are purely dissipative, i.e., they do
not allow local reverse energy transfer (known as ‘backscat-
ter’)
(Sarghini et al. 1999). Despite all these deﬁciencies,
without any doubt, the eddy-viscosity models are the most
commonly used SGS models in the atmospheric boundary
layer community.

From dimensional analysis, the eddy-viscosity (νt) can be
interpreted as the product of a characteristic velocity scale
and a characteristic length scale (Geurts 2003). Different
eddy-viscosity formulations basically use different velocity
and length scales. The most popular eddy-viscosity formu-
lation is the Smagorinsky model

(Smagorinsky 1963):

νt = (CS∆f )2

where CS is the so-called Smagorinsky coefﬁcient, which
is adjusted empirically or dynamically to account for shear,
stratiﬁcation and grid-resolution, and

utilizes (Moeng 1984; Sullivan et al. 1994; Sullivan et al.
2003):

(7)

where CK is a modeling coefﬁcient, l is a length scale and
ESGS is the SGS turbulence kinetic energy. This model-
ing approach involves solving an extra prognostic equation
for the SGS TKE. Based on the Kolmogorov’s scaling laws,
Wong and Lilly (1994) proposed yet another eddy-viscosity
model:

νt = C2/3∆

f

ǫ1/3 = Cǫ∆

,

(8)

where ǫ is the dissipation rate of energy and Cǫ is a model
coefﬁcient to be speciﬁed (or determined dynamically). There
are numerous other formulations for eddy-viscosity existing
in the literature (e.g., the Structure Function model of M´etais
and Lesieur 1992). An extensive review of these formula-
tions is given by Sagaut (2001).

Similar to the SGS stresses, the SGS heat ﬂuxes are mod-

eled with the eddy-diffusivity models as:

∂ ˜θ

P rSGS

(9)

where P rSGS is the SGS Prandtl number.

The values of the Smagorinsky-type SGS model param-
eters CS and P rSGS are well established for homogeneous,
isotropic turbulence (Lilly 1967). However, the value of
CS is expected to decrease with increasing mean shear and
stratiﬁcation. This has been conﬁrmed by various recent
ﬁeld studies (Port´e-Agel et al. 2001; Kleissl et al. 2003;
Sullivan et al. 2003; Kleissl et al. 2004). In order to ac-
count for this, application of the traditional eddy-viscosity
model in LES of ABL ﬂows (with strong shear near the
ground and temperature-driven stratiﬁcation) has tradition-
ally involved the use of various types of wall-damping func-
tions and stability corrections, which are either based on the
phenomenological theory of turbulence or empirically de-
rived from observational data (Mason 1994). For example,
recently, based on the HATS (Horizontal Array Turbulence
Study) ﬁeld campaign data Kleissl et al. (2003, 2004) pro-
posed the following empirical form for CS:

where L is the Obukhov length, κ is the von Karman con-
stant, R is the ramp function, n = 3 and c0
0.135.
Another example would be Smagorinsky-type SGS models
that impose both the wall-damping and stability corrections
based on the Kansas ﬁeld experiment data (see Brown et al.
1994; Mason 1994; Mason and Brown 1999; Beare and
MacVean 2004). In the case of TKE-based eddy-viscosity
models, the length scale l is usually set equal to the ﬁlter
width ∆f for unstable and neutral stratiﬁcations and equal to

≈

Cl√ESGS/N for stable stratiﬁcation (Sullivan et al. 1994;
Saiki et al. 2000; Sullivan et al. 2003), following the sugges-
tion of Deardorff (1980). Here, Cl is a coefﬁcient to be pre-
scribed and N is the Brunt-V¨ais¨al¨a frequency. When using
this approach, the SGS model coefﬁcients are often ‘tuned’
for different ABL ﬂow conditions (Sullivan et al. 1994; Saiki
et al. 2000; Sullivan et al. 2003). There also have been a
few elegant attempts to derive shear and stability dependent
length-scales directly from the phenomenological theory of
turbulence (Hunt et al. 1988; Schumann 1991; Canuto and
Cheng 1997). ‘The adequacy of all these parameterizations
for SGS ﬂuxes remains relatively untested however’
(Sulli-
van et al. 2003).

In the case of eddy-diffusivity SGS models, one needs
to prescribe the stability dependence of the SGS Prandtl
number (P rSGS). In general, P rSGS is found to increase
under stable stratiﬁcation, which is reﬂected in different
SGS modeling approaches. For example, in a widely used
Smagorinsky-type SGS model, the Prandtl number is in-
creased from 0.44 in the free convection limit to 0.7 in neu-
tral condition to 1.0 in the very stable regime (Mason and
Brown 1999). In contrast, the TKE-based SGS model uses
(Moeng 1984; Sullivan et al. 1994; Saiki et al. 2000; Sul-
livan et al. 2003): P rSGS = ∆f /(∆f + 2l), where l is
deﬁned as before. This implies that the P rSGS is 0.33 un-
der convective and neutral conditions and varies from 0.33
(weakly stable) to 1.0 (very stable) in the stably stratiﬁed
regime.

In summary, most of the conventional eddy-viscosity and
eddy-diffusivity SGS modeling approaches involve param-
eter tuning or a priori prescription in one way or another.
An alternative approach is to use the ‘dynamic’ SGS model-
ing approach of Germano (Germano et al. 1991; Germano
1992; Lilly 1992). In this approach, one computes the value
of the unknown SGS coefﬁcient (e.g., the coefﬁcient CS in
the Smagorinsky-type eddy-viscosity models) dynamically
at every time and position in the ﬂow. By looking at the
dynamics of the ﬂow at two different resolved scales and
assuming scale similarity as well as scale invariance of the
model coefﬁcient, one can optimize its value. Thus, the dy-
namic model avoids the need for a priori speciﬁcation and
tuning of the coefﬁcient because it is evaluated directly from
the resolved scales in an LES. In Moin et al. (1991), a similar
dynamic procedure was applied to estimate the SGS scalar
ﬂux in compressible ﬂows.
In essence this procedure not
only eliminates the need for any ad-hoc assumption about
the SGS Prandtl number (P rSGS) but also completely de-
couples the SGS ﬂux estimation from SGS stress computa-
tion, which is highly desirable.

plicit test ﬁlter of width α∆f in order to dynamically com-

and at α∆f leads to a SGS turbulent stress tensor (Tij) at the

pathlines (Meneveau et al. 1996).

In a recent study, Port´e-Agel et al. (2000) found that in a
simulation of neutral boundary layer the scale-invariant dy-
namic model is not dissipative enough in the near-ground
region. It underestimates shear in that region and also yields
excessively ﬂat spectra (Port´e-Agel et al. 2000). Moreover,

which is a much weaker assumption than the scale-invariance
modeling assumption of β = 1. Now, from Equations 14
and 16, one solves for the unknown parameter β, which in
turn is used to compute
utilizing Equation 14. Fur-
∆f
ther technical details on this model could be found in Port´e-
(cid:1)
Agel et al. (2000). In Port´e-Agel (2004), similar formula-
tions were derived for scalars. In this case, the lumped SGS
coefﬁcient C2
SGS was determined dynamically and the
scale-dependent parameter was termed as βθ. In the simu-
lations of neutral boundary layers, the scale-dependent SGS
model was found to exhibit ‘right’ dissipation behavior and
more accurate spectra in the case of momentum (Port´e-Agel
et al. 2000), as well as for passive scalars (Port´e-Agel 2004).
In the present study we found that the original formula-
tion of Port´e-Agel et al. (2000) which involves (horizontal)
planar averaging in Equation 14, suffers from an insufﬁcient
SGS dissipation problem in the outer layers in simulations
of stable boundary layers. This could be attributed to decou-
pling between horizontal planes under stratiﬁcation. Inter-
mittent, patchy turbulence in the strongly stable outer lay-
ers might be another cause. This issue was resolved by us-
ing a local formulation of the scale-dependent modeling ap-
proach, named as the locally-averaged scale-dependent dy-
namic (LASDD) model. The model coefﬁcients (C2
S and

6
LESofSBL

SP r−1

S and C2

SP r−1
C2
SGS) are obtained dynamically by averaging locally
on the horizontal plane with a stencil of three by three grid
points. Zang et al. (1993) followed a similar approach in
the scale-invariant dynamic (i.e., β = 1) modeling of turbu-
lent recirculating ﬂows. To avoid numerical instabilities the
coefﬁcients C2
SGS are set to zero whenever the
dynamic procedure yields negative values. This commonly
used procedure is known as ‘clipping’
(Geurts 2003). The
scale-dependence parameters (β and βθ) are determined dy-
namically over horizontal planes to avoid the computational
burden of computing them at every grid point in the ﬂow.
Solving for β or βθ involves a ﬁfth-order polynomial. In-
stead of the Newton-Raphson method used by Port´e-Agel
et al. (2000) and Port´e-Agel (2004), we use a more robust
eigenvalue based method (Press et al. 1992) to obtain the
roots of this polynomial. In the infrequent events that an ap-
propriate real root in the range of 0 to 1.2 is not found, we
chose to invoke the scale-invariance assumption of β (or, βθ)
= 1.

Please note that, mathematically more rigorous (and com-
putationally more expensive) local models are also proposed
in the literature (Ghosal et al. 1995; Piomelli and Liu 1995;
Meneveau et al. 1996). Their capabilities in the stably strat-
iﬁed atmospheric boundary layer simulations have yet to be
tested.

erately stable boundary layers it led to development of un-
physical proﬁles of various turbulent quantities (Saiki et al.
2000). The failure was due to the collapse of SGS vertical
heat ﬂux near the surface. This prompted them to propose a
two-part SGS model to represent the SGS heat ﬂux similar
to the SGS momentum ﬂux model of Sullivan et al. (1994).
However, even after the modiﬁcations, the simulations were
found to be too sensitive to rapid cooling (Saiki et al. 2000).
Kosovi´c and Curry (2000) simulated a clear-air, moder-
ately stable boundary layer as it approaches quasi-steady
state using the nonlinear SGS model of Kosovi´c (1997).
Initial conditions consistent with the Beaufort Sea Arctic
Stratus Experiment (BASE) observations were used. The
ﬁrst intercomparison study of LES-SGS models for stable
boundary layer (Holtslag 2003; Beare et al. 2004), as part
of the GABLS initiative, also used this case (slightly modi-
ﬁed). Eleven different models with very different SGS mod-
eling options and different grid-resolutions (from 1 m to
In this paper, we
12.5 m) were run (Beare et al. 2004).
also simulate this particular case with our newly proposed
locally-averaged scale-dependent dynamic (LASDD) SGS
model. We compare our results with theoretical predictions
(Nieuwstadt 1984a, b, 1985), ﬁeld obser-
by Nieuwstadt
vations, as well as with well-established empirical formu-
lations.

4. LES of Stably Stratiﬁed Boundary Layers

The ﬁrst LES of a stable boundary layer was performed
by Mason and Derbyshire (1990). They used the traditional
Smagorinsky-type SGS model with a constant SGS Prandtl
number (P rSGS = 0.5). Their results broadly supported the
local scaling hypothesis of Nieuwstadt (Nieuwstadt 1984a;
Nieuwstadt 1984b; Nieuwstadt 1985; Derbyshire 1990).
However, one of their simulations showed the run-away
cooling problem. The simulated surface temperature fell
more than 30 K over 90 minutes. Brown et al. (1994) re-
peated these simulations with their stochastic backscatter
SGS model (with stability corrections). Their results deﬁ-
nitely showed some improvements (especially in the surface
layer properties) when compared with the Mason and Der-
byshire’s simulations.

Andr´en (1995) simulated weakly stable boundary layers
with the TKE-based SGS model of Moeng (1984) and also
with the two-part eddy-viscosity model developed by Sulli-
van et al. (1994). The two-part eddy-viscosity model, which
is a modiﬁed version of the TKE-based SGS model, was in
better agreement with the surface-layer similarity theory.

Recently, Saiki et al. (2000) attempted to simulate a mod-
erately stable boundary layer with Sullivan et al.’s two-part
(Sullivan et al. 1994). Although, this
eddy-viscosity model
particular SGS scheme has been previously used by Andr´en
for weakly stable BLs (Andr´en 1995), in the case of mod-

The GABLS LES intercomparison case study is described

driven by an imposed, uniform geostrophic wind (G = 8
m s−1), with a surface cooling rate of 0.25 K per hour and
attains a quasi-steady state in
8-9 hours with a boundary
layer depth of
200 m. The initial mean potential tem-
perature is 265 K upto 100 m with an overlying inversion
of strength 0.01 K m−1. The Coriolis parameter is set to

b. Description of the LES Code

In this work, we have used a modiﬁed version of the LES
code described in Albertson and Parlange (1999), Port´e-
Agel et al. (2000), and Port´e-Agel (2004). The salient fea-
tures of this code are as follows:

It solves the ﬁltered Navier-Stokes equations written
in rotational form (Orszag and Pao 1974).

Derivatives in the horizontal directions are computed
using the Fourier Collocation method, while vertical
derivatives are approximated with second-order cen-
tral differences (Canuto et al. 1988).

Dealiasing of the nonlinear terms in Fourier space is
done using the 3/2 rule (Canuto et al. 1988).

intercomparison study, the constants bm and bh were set to
4.8 and 7.8, respectively.

The upper boundary consists of a zero stress condition,
whereas the lateral boundary condition assumes periodicity.
A Rayleigh damping layer at 300 m is used following the
GABLS case description.

Explicit second-order Adams-Bashforth time advance-
ment scheme is used (Canuto et al. 1988).

c. Results

Explicit spectral cutoff ﬁltering is used. The ratio be-
tween the ﬁlter-width (∆f ) and grid-spacing (∆g) is
set to 2. Here α is taken to be equal to √2.

Only Coriolis terms involving horizontal wind are
considered.

Forcing is imposed by Geostrophic wind.

Staggered vertical grid is used.

•
The lower boundary condition is based on the Monin-
Obukhov similarity theory with a surface roughness length
z◦. The instantaneous components of surface shear stresses
τxz and τyz are represented as functions of the resolved ve-
locities ˜u and ˜v, at the grid point immediately above the sur-
face (i.e., at a height of z = ∆z/2 in our case):

In this section we report the results of our tuning-free sim-
ulations and attempt to evaluate them against the theoretical
predictions and well established observations-based formu-
lations. Our results show clear improvements over most of
the traditional models in the surface layer. We would like
to emphasize that in the surface layer the relative contribu-
tion of the SGS to the overall turbulent ﬂuxes is very large.
This is also the location where gradients are much stronger.
Hence, simulation results become very sensitive to SGS for-
mulations near the ground. The comparisons we perform
are extensive and address: (1) temporal evolution of simu-
lated statistics, (2) various ﬁrst order statistics of turbulent
velocity and temperature ﬁelds, (3) second order statistics of
turbulent velocity and temperature ﬁelds, and (4) character-
istics of dynamically estimated SGS coefﬁcients. Details of
these comparisons are provided below.

The boundary layer height (H), Obukhov length (L) and
other characteristics of the simulated SBLs using the locally-
averaged scale-dependent dynamic SGS model (averaged
over the ﬁnal hour of simulation) are given in Table 1. Fol-
lowing Kosovi´c and Curry (2000) and Beare et al. (2004),
the boundary layer height (H) is deﬁned as (1/0.95) times
the height where the mean local stress falls to ﬁve percent of
its surface value. From this table, it is apparent that the sim-
ulated (bulk) boundary layer parameters are quite insensitive
to the grid resolution. In LES this behavior is always desir-
able and its existence is usually attributed to the strength of
a SGS model.

In Figures 1 and 2 the time series of surface momentum
ﬂux, surface buoyancy ﬂux, Obukhov length (L) and bound-
ary layer height (H) are shown. The surface momentum
ﬂux reaches quasi-equilibrium after 4 hours of simulation.
On the other hand the Obukhov length and boundary layer

In a similar manner, the surface heat ﬂux is computed as:

the surface boundary condition is prescribed by a ﬁxed cool-
ing rate rather than a ﬁxed ﬂux, it is anticipated that the sur-
face buoyancy ﬂux will keep on evolving with time.

2) FIRST-ORDER STATISTICS

The mean proﬁles of wind speed, wind angle and po-
tential temperature averaged over the ﬁnal hour (8-9 hours)
of simulation, are shown in Figures 3 and 4. The super-
geostrophic nocturnal jet near the top of the boundary layer,
is in accordance with Nieuwstadt’s theoretical model for
‘stationary’ stable boundary layers [see Equation 17 of Nieuw-
stadt (1985)]. However, the angle between the surface wind
direction and the geostrophic wind simulated by our LES is
35 degrees. This is much smaller than Nieuwstadt’s pre-
∼
diction of 60 degrees. The second-order closure model of
58 de-
Brost and Wyngaard (1978) also predicts a value of

∼

grees. In contrast, the results from the GABLS study (Beare
et al. 2004) and Kosovi´c and Curry (2000) are in agreement
with our results.

where KM and KH represent eddy diffusivities for momen-
tum and heat ﬂux, respectively. The dependence of P rt on
atmospheric stability is not strong (Derbyshire 1999; How-
150
ell and Sun 1999). Inside the boundary layer (up to
m), (almost) all our simulated results yield Rig
0.7
Rif
(not shown here). Based on phenomenological theories of
turbulence Townsend (1976) and Yakhot and Orszag (1986)
also derived P rt = 0.7. However, in the surface layer our
results show that the values of P rt increase to
1. This
is consistent with ‘Microfronts’ ﬁeld experimental data an-
alyzed by Howell and Sun (1999). They found on average,
the estimates of P rt at 3 m level are higher than at the 10 m
level, indicating that the relative efﬁciency of turbulent mo-
mentum transfer with respect to heat transfer increases in the
proximity of the land surface (Howell and Sun 1999).

Nieuwstadt was aware of the fact that this hypothesis does
not hold for the lower part of the boundary layer
(Nieuw-
stadt 1985). In fact, Rig and Rif should go to zero near the
surface (Nieuwstadt 1985), as can be seen from our sim-
ulations (Figure 5). The violation of the basic assumption
in the proximity of the land surface might explain some of
the discrepancies between the LES results and Nieuwstadt’s
predictions.

The Richardson numbers represent the ratio of the amount
of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) destroyed by buoyancy
forces to the amount of TKE generated by wind shear
(Stull
1988). The values of Rif are consistently higher than the
corresponding Rig values, which is expected (see below).
In the interior part of the boundary layer, Rig is more or less
constant (
0.2), in accord with Nieuwstadt’s assumption.
However, Rif increases monotonically and is higher than
0.2 in the upper part of the boundary layer. The magnitudes
of both these Richardson numbers increase sharply near the

wise, surface values are implied. Recently, Mahrt and Vick-

ilarity theory’, since it approaches Monin-Obukhov similar-
ity as z decreases and also conforms to z-less stratiﬁcation
as z

ted against z/Λ show slopes slightly smaller than the widely

ﬁeld observations data, Mahrt and Vickers (2003) found a
slope of 3.7 [in contrast to 4.7 as proposed by Businger et al.
(1971)], which also ﬁts our LES results remarkably well.
Previous studies, such as Beljaars and Holtslag (1991) also
found that ΦML and ΦHL increase slower than Businger
et al.’s formulations and they proposed the aforementioned
nonlinear formulation (Beljaars and Holtslag 1991).

There exists another representation for the nondimen-
sional gradients in terms of local gradient Richardson num-
ber (Rig). Figure 7 once again shows that the agreement
between our LES results and established formulations are
quite satisfactory. In the literature, usually the critical gra-
dient Richardson number (Rigc) is considered to be around
0.25. For Rigc > 0.25 turbulence is very weak (Stull 1988;
Brown et al. 1994), which is also noticeable in Figure 7.

3) SECOND-ORDER STATISTICS

The mean proﬁles of vertical momentum ﬂux and buoy-
ancy ﬂux averaged over the ﬁnal hour (8-9 hours) of sim-
ulation are given in Figure 8. The dashed lines show the
resolved ﬂux, and the dotted lines denote the SGS contribu-
tion to the ﬂux. As would be anticipated, near the ground

the SGS contribution is much larger than its resolved coun-
terpart. In the GABLS intercomparison study, there is a sig-
niﬁcant spread between the total momentum and buoyancy
ﬂux proﬁles simulated with different models. In particular at
the surface the mean momentum and buoyancy ﬂuxes range
10−4 m2s−3, re-
from 0.06 to 0.08 m2s−2 and -3.5 to -5.5
spectively (Beare et al. 2004). Our simulated results also
fall in these ranges.

Figures 10 and 11 show the (resolved) variances of ve-

In the surface layer,
the normalized resolved velocity variances are smaller than
Nieuwstadt’s ﬁeld observations (Nieuwstadt 1984a, b). This
is expected as the SGS contributions to these variances have
not been added here. This will be done while studying
Nieuwstadt’s local scaling hypothesis and will be shown to
be in excellent agreement with Nieuwstadt’s observations
(see below). We would like to point out that in contrast to our
simulated results, the nonlinear SGS model simulations by
Kosovi´c and Curry (2000) surprisingly yielded surface layer
velocity variances (resolved plus SGS) which were
40
percent smaller than Nieuwstadt’s observations.

1984a, b, 1985) conjectured that under stable stratiﬁcation,
the local Obukhov length (Λ) based on local turbulent ﬂuxes
should be considered as a more fundamental length scale.
Then, according to this hypothesis, dimensionless combina-
tions of turbulent variables [gradients, ﬂuxes, (co-)variances
etc.] which are measured at the same height (z) could be
expressed as ‘universal’ functions of the stability parameter,
ζ (= z/Λ). Exact forms of these functions could be pre-
dicted by dimensional analysis only in the asymptotic very
), as discussed below. In the very sta-
stable case (ζ
ble regime (z-less condition), since any explicit dependence
on z disappears, local scaling predicts that dimensionless
turbulent quantities asymptotically approach constant values
(Nieuwstadt 1984a, b, 1985). Local scaling could be viewed
as a generalization of the well established Monin-Obukhov
(M-O) similarity theory (Monin and Yaglom 1971; Sorbjan
1989). M-O similarity theory is strictly valid in the surface
layer (lowest 10% of the ABL), whereas local scaling de-
scribes the turbulent structure of the entire SBL (Nieuwstadt
1984a, b, 1985).

→ ∞

Whether or not our LES-generated statistics support the
local scaling hypothesis was studied extensively in our re-
cent work (Basu et al. 2005). In that study, we also per-
formed rigorous statistical analyses of ﬁeld observations and
wind-tunnel measurements in order to verify the validity of
local scaling hypothesis under very stable conditions. An ex-
tensive set of turbulence statistics, computed from ﬁeld and
wind-tunnel measurements and also from LES-generated
datasets, supported the validity of the local scaling hypothe-
sis (in the cases of traditional bottom-up as well as upside-
down stable boundary layers over homogeneous, ﬂat ter-
rains). We demonstrated that non-turbulent effects need to
be removed from ﬁeld data while studying similarity hy-

potheses, otherwise the results could be misleading (Basu
et al. 2005). For completeness of the present paper, we de-
cided to include some key local scaling results. For ease
in representation, we categorize our LES-generated database
based on local stabilities (z/Λ) (see Table 2). The class S1
represents near neutral stability; while S5 corresponds to the
very stable regime.

In Figures 12 and 13 we plot the normalized standard
deviation of velocity components and temperature, respec-
tively. The results are presented using standard boxplot no-
tation with marks at 95, 75, 50, 25, and 5 percentile of an
empirical distribution. The SGS contributions to the total
standard deviations are estimated following the approach of
Mason (Mason 1989; Mason and Derbyshire 1990).

It is quite evident from Figures 12 and 13 that the normal-
ized standard deviation of the turbulence variables closely
follows the local scaling predictions and also z-less strati-
ﬁcation. In Table 3 we further report the median values of
the turbulence statistics corresponding to the category S5.
Loosely, these median values could be considered as the
asymptotic z-less values, which are found to be remarkably
close to Nieuwstadt’s analytical predictions and also ﬁeld
observations (see Table 3). For an example, Nieuwstadt’s
theory predicts that the normalized vertical velocity stan-
1.4 in the z-
dard deviation asymptotically approaches
less regime. In Basu et al. (2005), we observed this value to
be in the narrow range of 1.4 to 1.6. Recently, Heinemann
(2004) compiled a list (see Table 2 of their paper) of tur-

In Figure 14, we report the mutual correlations between
u, w and θ. The z-less values are also reported in Table
3. Once again, these values are very similar to the ones
compiled by Heinemann (2004), our previous study (Basu
et al. 2005), results of Sorbjan (1986) and theoretical predic-
tions of Nieuwstadt (1984b). As a note, Kaimal and Finni-
gan (1994) also report that for 0 < ζ < 1, ruθ = 0.6, which
is close to the values found in the present study.

In light of the foregoing analyses it is certain that the lo-
cal scaling hypothesis of Nieuwstadt, which has survived the
last two decades, still holds for a wide range of stabilities and
is well reproduced by our LES model.

ically obtained using the locally-averaged scale-dependent
dynamic model. β and βθ are found to be signiﬁcantly
smaller than 1 in the entire boundary layer. This stresses the
fact that the assumption of scale-invariance in anisotropic
stably stratiﬁed ﬂows is not appropriate. Indeed, both CS
and P rSGS are found to be scale dependent. The scale-
dependent parameters are also expected to depend on local
stability as they decrease signiﬁcantly in the strongly strati-
ﬁed inversion layer. CS is found to decrease with increasing
atmospheric stability, consistent with recent ﬁeld observa-
tions (Port´e-Agel et al. 2001; Kleissl et al. 2003). The SGS
Prandtl number (P rSGS) is more or less constant inside the
1 in the inver-
boundary layer and gradually increases to
sion layer, as commonly assumed. Moreover, the values of
P rSGS increase in the surface layer. Earlier, we described
very similar behavior in the case of turbulent Prandtl number
(P rt).

scale model, termed as the locally-averaged scale-dependent
dynamic (LASDD) model. This SGS model shares most
of the desirable characteristics of the plane-averaged scale-
dependent dynamic models, originally proposed by Port´e-
Agel et al. (2000) for the SGS stresses, and Port´e-Agel (2004)
for SGS ﬂuxes. For example, it does not require any a priori
speciﬁcation of SGS coefﬁcients since they are computed
dynamically in a self-consistent manner. The dynamically
estimated coefﬁcients are found to strongly depend on ﬁl-
ter scale and atmospheric stability, in close agreement with
a priori ﬁeld studies (Port´e-Agel et al. 2001; Kleissl et al.
2003). However, in contrast to the original plane-averaged
version, the LASDD model does not suffer from the in-
sufﬁcient SGS dissipation problem in simulations of stable
boundary layers.

The potential of our SGS model is made clear in coarse-

resolution large-eddy simulations of moderately stable bound-
the agreements between our LES-
ary layers. Overall,
generated turbulence statistics and observations, as well as
some well-established empirical formulations and theoreti-
cal predictions are remarkable. The results also show clear
improvements over most of the traditional SGS models in
the surface layer.
In essence, we showed that tuning-free
simulations of stable atmospheric boundary layers are fea-
sible even with relatively coarse resolutions if one uses a
robust and reliable SGS scheme.

The next logical step would be to check the performance
of this new-generation SGS scheme in simulating very sta-
ble boundary layers. This would of course require exten-
sive validation against existing proﬁles of various turbulence
statistics measured during different ﬁeld campaigns (e.g,
Cooperative Atmosphere-Surface Exchange Study 1999 -

CASES99; Beaufort Sea Arctic Stratus Experiment - BASE;
Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean - SHEBA). One
of the characteristics of strongly stratiﬁed boundary layers
is the existence of global intermittency (turbulent burstings
in the midst of a laminar ﬂow). In contrast to the traditional
SGS models, the locally-averaged scale-dependent dynamic
LES model has the correct behavior in laminar and transi-
tional ﬂows. This makes us believe that this model will be
able to model the complex intermittency behavior of the very
stable boundary layer ﬂows.

Contemporary SBL research has revealed that in very sta-
ble regimes the relative importance of radiative cooling and
heat exchange with the underlying soil becomes as signiﬁ-
cant as turbulent mixing (van de Wiel 2002). This means
that radiation and soil physics should also be included in
LES models before attempting very stable simulations. An-
other interesting feature of this type of boundary layer ﬂows
is the presence of gravity waves. Conceptually, LES is
capable of simulating gravity waves, provided the domain
size is large enough. Unfortunately, the present computa-
tional power dictates that in such cases one must have a rel-
atively coarse resolution making thus the locally-averaged
scale-dependent dynamic model more desirable than the
laminarization-prone traditional SGS models. These issues
will be addressed in our future research.

Abstract

The derivation of Quasi-One-Dimensional Model for turbulent rel-
ative dispersion (Kurbanmuradov, Monte Carlo Methods and its ap-
plications, 3(1), 37-52, 1997) is reviewed and an error is detected. An
estimation of the diﬀerence between the correct and the incorrect for-
mulations is given in a very simpliﬁed turbulence. The correct formu-
lation proves to behave more in agreement with results obtained by
standard three dimensional Lagrangian Stochastic Models.

Introduction

The Lagrangian Stochastic approach has long been used to model relative
dispersion in turbulent ﬂows. The Well Mixed Condition provides a theoret-
ically sound basis for this approach. However, indetermination of the Well
Mixed problem in more than one dimension remains.

The Quasi-One-Dimensional (Q1D) approach [1] was proposed as a pos-
sible solution to this problem. This useful idea is based on the fact that
the isotropy of the inertial subrange allows the description of the separation
only.

The indetermination is solved by assuming that the longitudinal separa-
tion acceleration depends on longitudinal variables only, in particular on lon-
gitudinal velocity, and not on the orthogonal components. The assumption,
hereinafter referred to as the Q1D Assumption, i.e., the Kurbanmuradov
“Assumption A” [2], implies the formal reduction of a three-dimensional
mathematical problem to a one-dimensional one, as reﬂected in its name.

Subsequently, the model in [2] was applied by Kurbanmuradov in col-
laboration with other authors [3, 4, 5, 6] and by Borgas and Yeung [7] in

1

a comparison between a Lagrangian Stochastic Model and Direct Numeri-
cal Simulations, by Reynolds [8] in a comparison among Stochastic Models,
and by Franzese and Borgas [9] in formulating a concentration ﬂuctuations
model.

It has already been observed that applications of the Q1D model yield
values of the Richardson coeﬃcient g [10] that are very large, when compared
to classical Well Mixed models [2, 8, 6]. However, this discrepancy has not
been addressed so far.

The present paper provides a detailed review of the formulation in order
to explain such large values of g. In the next section, the variable trans-
formation of a Fokker-Planck Equation (FPE) and its associated Stochastic
Diﬀerential Equation (SDE) is derived. In the Section 3, the Well Mixed,
Q1D, Lagrangian Stochastic Model is formulated. Results are presented in
Section 4.

3 The Well Mixed Q1D formulation

As pointed out above, turbulent relative dispersion can be modelled with
a ﬁrst order Markovian process, so that the LS model is formulated in the
phase-space. In this case, the previous notation will change

}
{
, where r and u are the
xi = ui−3; i = 4, 6
with
}
{
spatial separation vector and the velocity diﬀerence vector between two ﬂuid
particles respectively, and r and u their moduli.

xi = ri; i = 1, 3
}
{

and

Kurbanmuradov’s idea is based on an opportune spherical change in
variables. The components of the spatial separation vector r are changed
from a Cartesian to a spherical system, and the components of the velocity
x′
i =
diﬀerence vector u are projected onto them. The new variables are
{
⊥, u′′

i = u′
where r′ = (r, θ, φ) and u′ = (uk, u′

and the transformation is:

i−3; i = 4, 6

r1 = r sin θ cos φ

noting that the joint pdf p′(uk, u⊥) is normalised with a weight 2πu⊥.

The Jacobians of the spatial and velocity transformations are Jr =
r2 sin θ and Ju = u⊥, respectively, so that the Jacobian of the complete
transformation (10) turns out to be J = JrJu = r2u⊥ sin θ. In the Cartesian
variables system, the Kramers-Moyal coeﬃcients are

Di = ui

; Di = ai

, i = 4, 6

,

Dij = C0εδij

, i, j = 4, 6

,

where a is the relative acceleration between two ﬂuid particles, C0 the La-
grangian Kolmogorov universal constant and ε the mean rate of energy dis-
sipation. The choice of Dij is consistent with the Lagrangian second order
structure function neglecting intermittency eﬀects, and eliminates the am-
biguity between Ito’s and Stratonovich’s calculi of stochastic integrals [12].

The Q1D Assumption, the central element of the closure scheme adopted
here, is now introduced to solve the multidimensional indetermination of
Well Mixed Lagrangian Stochastic Models.

Assumption 1 (Quasi-One-Dimensional Assumption [2]) The Kramers-
Moyal coeﬃcient D′

bearing in mind that for a Eulerian pdf the Lagrangian random variable r
becomes a parameter, like the time t in the Lagrangian one.

Integrating the FPE in (20) over u⊥ weighted with 2π, and adopting (14-

16)(22) and the Q1D Assumption (21), the following equation is obtained

It is worth noting here that the key point in the correct derivation is
that the Jacobian considered in the Well Mixed Condition transformation
depends solely on
because they are the only random variables involved.
In fact, for a Eulerian pdf the Lagrangian random variables ri become just
parameters and thus they are not considered in the normalisation.

As a last remark, it can be pointed out that the Well Mixed formulation
of the Q1D model Eq. (24) results to be formally identically to any Well
Mixed one-dimensional Lagrangian Stochastic Model [14, 15]. Thus, the
one-dimensional model based on [15] used in [8] corresponds exactly to the
correct formulation of the Q1D model.

4 Results and conclusions

In order to verify the results of the previous Section, numerical simulations
were performed. For the sake of simplicity, a Gaussian pdf is assumed for
the longitudinal velocity diﬀerence. Although not in agreement with basic
knowledge on the inertial subrange, it is assumed here so as to keep the com-
parison between the two formulations as simple as possible. Furthermore,
we assumed a simple longitudinal correlation function of the form

σk = 2σ0

which gives a crude description of the inertial subrange scaling of the longi-
tudinal structure function. In this case λ is representative of the decaying
scale in the inertial subrange and not of the integral value of correlation.
Despite those very simple assumptions, the results are expected to be rep-
resentative of the diﬀerence between the two formulations.

Integration of Langevin equation Eq. (26) with drift deﬁned by Eq. (28)
and Equation (29) gives us an estimation of the magnitude of the error in-
volved when using the non Well Mixed formulation. Being β =
the

unique parameter on which the FPE depends [16], the comparison is per-
formed for diﬀerent values of this parameter. As an example, Figure 1 shows
the normalised mean square distance as a function of time for β = 1. It can
be observed that the correct formulation gives a growth of
more in
agreement with the t3 law than the incorrect model which in turn does not
present a “real” t3 growth.

Figure 2 presents the values of g∗ =

the error of the incorrect formulation is large and is itself a function of β.

As a concluding remark, it can be said that, given the non negligible
diﬀerence found here, much work should be made for the re-interpretation
of the results based on the Q1D Assumption in order to avoid the use of
biased values of the derived quantities.

Statistical Modelling of the Relationship Between Main
Development Region Sea Surface Temperature and Landfalling
Atlantic Basin Hurricane Numbers

Abstract

We are building a hurricane number prediction scheme that relies, in part, on statistical modelling
of the empirical relationship between Atlantic sea surface temperatures and landfalling hurricane
numbers. We test out a number of simple statistical models for that relationship, using data from
1900 to 2005 and data from 1950 to 2005, and for both all hurricane numbers and intense hurricane
numbers. The results are very diﬀerent from the corresponding analysis for basin hurricane numbers.

1 Introduction

We are interested in developing practical methods for the prediction of the distribution of the number
of hurricanes that might make landfall in the US over the next 5 years. One possible way to make such
predictions is via a 2-step method that involves predicting main development region (MDR) sea surface
temperature (SST), and then predicting landfalling hurricane numbers as a function of the MDR SST. The
ﬁrst step of predicting MDR SST has been considered in Meagher and Jewson (2006) and Laepple et al.
(2006). This paper investigates the second step, and considers statistical relations that one might use
to model the relationship between MDR SST and the number of landfalls. This paper closely follows
an earlier paper (Binter et al., 2006) in which we modelled the relationship between MDR SST and the
number of hurricanes in the basin. The data and the models we use, and the format of the results we
present, are all taken from that paper. Readers should refer to that paper for further details including
a short discussion, with references, giving an overview of the physical relationship between SST and
hurricanes.
The rest of this article proceeds as follows:
landfalling hurricane data, and in section 3 we discuss what we have found.

in section 2 we show the results from our tests on the

2 Results

We now present results from our comparisons of the ability of various statistical models to represent the
relationship between MDR SST and landfalling hurricane numbers. First we consider models for the total
number of landfalling hurricanes, for the periods 1900-2005 and 1950-2005, and then we consider models
for intense landfalling hurricane numbers for the same two periods.

2.1 All hurricanes, 1900-2005

The ﬁrst results we present are based on all landfalling hurricanes, and data from 1900 to 2005.
The scatter plot shown in ﬁgure 1 shows the number of hurricanes versus the SST during this period.
The picture is dramatically diﬀerent from what we saw when we considered the relationship between SST
and the number of hurricanes in the basin in Binter et al. (2006). In that case there was a clear positive
relationship. In this case, there is, at least prima facie, no relationship at all. Table 1 shows that the
linear correlation is 0.16 and the rank correlation is 0.12.

Table 2 shows the score comparisons for the six models for this data set, and table 4 shows the p-
values for the pairwise comparison of these models. The best model, in terms of out-of-sample RMSE
performance, is the exponential negative binomial model, but the score is only slightly better than the
trivial ﬂat poisson model with has no relationship between landfalling numbers and SST. The point-wise
comparisons shows that the non-trivial models are not statistically distinguishable from the trivial model.
As far as the log-likelihood scores in table 2 are concerned, we ﬁnd that the ﬂat poisson model defeats
the linear and damped linear normal models in a statistically signiﬁcant way. The remaining models do
not beat the ﬂat-line model in a statistically signiﬁcant way.
In table 3 we see that the slope parameters of all the non-trivial models are not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent
from zero. In other words, based on these parameter estimates and standard errors, we certainly couldn’t
reject a null-hypothesis that there is no relation at all between MDR SST and the number of landfalling
hurricanes.
The damping parameter in the damped linear trend model is much less than 1 (0.73), in response to the
weak (or perhaps non-existent) signal that we are trying to identify.
The linear relationships between SST and hurricane numbers, for what they are worth, give a sensitivity
of between 0.64 and 0.69 hurricanes per degree.
In summary: we don’t see any indication of a relationship between MDR and SST and landfalling
hurricane numbers.

2.2 All hurricanes, 1950-2005

Given the lack of a signiﬁcant relationship between SST and hurricane numbers on the data from 1900
to 2005, it is interesting to see if we can ﬁnd one using the more recent data. On the one hand, the more
recent data is more accurate, and so it might be more likely we can detect a relationship. On the other
hand, using less data will make it even harder to estimate the parameters of the models.
Table 6 shows that all the non-trivial models defeat the ﬂat poisson model. The results for linear normal,
damped linear normal and linear poisson are statistically signiﬁcant.
As far as the log-likelihood scores are concerned, the linear normal and damped linear normal models
are defeated by the ﬂat poisson model in a statistically signiﬁcant way. The linear poisson model defeats
the trivial model in a statistically signiﬁcant way (for RMSE). However, based on these results, it’s hard
to conclude deﬁnitively that the linear poisson model is best. For instance, in the pairwise comparisons
for RMSE and log-likelihood, the exponential poisson model also defeats the linear poisson model in a
statistically signiﬁcant way.
Once again the slope parameters in the non-trivial models are all indistinguishable from zero. The linear
relationships now have slopes between 0.99 and 1.2, but with standard errors of up to 0.63.
Overall, there is at least now some statistical evidence of a relationship between SST and landfalling
hurricane numbers, although the parameters of the relationship are very poorly estimated.

2.3 Intense hurricanes

We have only just found a relationship between MDR SSTs and the total number of landfalling hurricanes.
Could there be a relationship between MDR SSTs and the number of intense landfalling hurricanes, for
which there is even less data? The scatter plots (ﬁgures 7 and 8) suggest that there is no such relationship.
Our statistical results (tables 10 to 17) conﬁrm that none of the non-trivial models defeat the ﬂat trivial
model in a statistically signiﬁcant way for both data sets 1900-2005 and 1950-2005. In fact, for the 1950-
2005 data set, the ﬂat-line model defeats the linear and damped linear normal model in a statistically
signiﬁcant way in the probabilistic comparison.

3 Summary

We have investigated whether there is a statistical relationship between MDR SST and the number of
hurricanes making landfall in the US. In previous work we’ve seen a strong relationship between MDR
SST and the number of Atlantic basin hurricanes, and so our a priori assumption is that there must be
some relationship for landfall numbers as well. Our analysis, however, ﬁnds only a weak relationship for
total hurricane numbers and no relationship at all for intense hurricane numbers.
Why could this be? We see two possible explanations:

• There is a physical relationship between SST and landfalling hurricane numbers, but this relation-
ship is mostly obscured by the signal-to-noise ratio, which is very poor because there are so few
landfalling hurricanes.

• Even though there is a strong physical relationship between SST and basin hurricane numbers,
there is only a weak physical relationship between SST and landfalling hurricane numbers. The
eﬀects of SST conspire to change the proportion of hurricanes that make landfall in such a way that
the eﬀects that are seen in the basin numbers almost disappear when we consider the landfalls. For
instance, higher SSTs may mean higher numbers of hurricanes in the basin (on average), but they
may also mean a lower proportion making landfall, and these two eﬀects may combine in such a
way that the actual number making landfall remains the same.

And of course reality may be a combination of these two eﬀects.
We are investigating both of these possibilities. W.r.t. the ﬁrst, we are considering simple statistical
systems to see whether this is really the behaviour that we would expect under idealized assumptions.
W.r.t. the second, we are performing statistical tests to investigate the hypothesis that the proportion
of hurricanes making landfall really does vary in such a way as to mask the eﬀects of SST on numbers of
hurricanes.

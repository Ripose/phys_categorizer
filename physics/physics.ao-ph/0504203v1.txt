Double-diﬀusive convection in a horizontally inﬁnite layer of a unit height in a large Rayleigh
numbers limit is considered. From linear stability analysis it is shown, that the convection tends
to have a form of travelling tall thin rolls with height 10 − 30 times larger than width. Amplitude
equations of ABC type for vertical variations of amplitude of these rolls and mean values of diﬀu-
sive components are derived. As a result of its numerical simulation it is shown, that for a wide
variety of parameters considered ABC system have solutions, known as diﬀusive chaos, which can
be useful for explanation of ﬁne structure generation in some important oceanographical systems
like thermohaline staircases.

INTRODUCTION

Double-diﬀusive or thermohaline convection plays im-
portant role in a heat-mass transfer processes in the
ocean.
It also essentially inﬂuences on diﬀerent small
scale processes, like formation of vertical temperature
and salinity ﬁne structure. Such phenomena are not well
understood at present day. So the aim of this article is
to develop mathematical model, describing formation of
vertical patterns due to double-diﬀusive convection. It
provides possibility to predict parameters of convection
driven microstructure and to recognize such microstruc-
ture by diﬀerent experimental methods.

The initial equations describe two-dimensional thermo-
haline convection in a liquid layer of thickness h, bounded
by two inﬁnite plane horizontal boundaries. The liquid
moves in a vertical plane and the motion is described by
the stream function ψ(t, x, z). The horizontal x and ver-
tical z space variables are used; the time is denoted by
t.
It is assumed, that there are no distributed sources
of heat and salt, and on the upper and lower bound-
aries of the area these quantities have constant values.
Hence, basic distribution of temperature and salinity is
linear along the vertical and is not depend on time. The
variables θ(t, x, z) and ξ(t, x, z) describe variations in the
temperature and salinity about this main distribution.
There are two types of thermohaline convection: the ﬁn-
gering, in which the warmer and more saline liquid is at
the upper boundary of the area, and the diﬀusive type,
in which the temperature and salinity are greater at the
lower boundary[1]. In this paper we study the later case.
The governing equations in the Boussinesq approxi-
mation in dimensionless form are a system of nonlinear
equations in ﬁrst order partial derivatives with respect to
time, that depend on four parameters: the Prandtl num-
ber σ (usual value - 7.0), the Lewis number τ (0 < τ < 1,

Here the Jacobian J(f, g) = ∂xf ∂zg
∂xg∂zf is intro-
duced. The boundary conditions for the dependent vari-
ables are chosen to be zero, which implies that the tem-
perature and salinity at the boundaries of the area are
constants, the vorticity vanishes at the boundaries, and
the boundaries are impermeable:

−

ψ = ∂2

z ψ = θ = ξ = 0 on z = 0, 1.

(2)

These boundary conditions are usually called free-slip
conditions because the horizontal velocity component at
the boundary does not vanish.

As a space scale the thickness of the liquid layer h is
used. As a time scale value t0 = h2/χ is used, where
χ is the thermal diﬀusivity of the liquid. Velocity ﬁeld
components are determined as vz = (χ/h)∂xψ and vx =
(χ/h)∂zψ. For temperature T and salinity S we have

relations:

Consider thermohaline convection in a limit of large
RS, which is true for the most of oceanographically im-
1012). After rescaling
portant applications (RS ≈
of the time t = (σRS)−1/2t′, and the stream function
ψ = (σRS)1/2ψ′, we can rewrite basic system (1) in a
singularly disturbed form (primes are omitted):

Here a small parameter ε4 = 1/σRS and a buoyancy fre-
quency N 2 = 1
RT /RS are introduced. In this system
singular perturbations are present as ε2 before Lapla-
cians.
If we let ε = 0, then our system (3) turns into
common equations, describing two-dimensional internal
waves with the constant buoyancy frequency N in the
Boussinesq approximation.

For investigating of a linear stability problem for the
system (3) with boundary conditions (2) we omit nonlin-
ear terms in the right part of the system and choose a
solution in a form of normal mode:

ψ(x, z, t) = Aeiλt−ikx sin nπz,
θ(x, z, t) = aT eiλt−ikx sin nπz,
ξ(x, z, t) = aSeiλt−ikx sin nπz.

where λ is an eigen value, describing growth rate of the
mode, k is a horizontal wave number, n is a number of
the mode and A is an amplitude of the mode. After
substitution of the expressions (4) into the system (3)
we get a system of algebraic equations with solvability
condition, having a form of a third order polynomial with
respect to λ:

(λ + σε2κ2)(λ + ε2κ2)(λ + τ ε2κ2)
k2N 2
κ2 (λ + γε2κ2) = 0.

Here κ2 = k2 + n2π2 is a full wave number and γ is a
τ )/N 2. Equation (5) is known as
constant: γ = τ + (1
dispersive relation and has three roots, two of which can
be complexly conjugated for a suﬃciently small value of
ε. In the later case a Hopf bifurcation take place when
at some values of N and ε real part of the complex con-
jugates roots turns to zero. It is true when

ε = 0.00153, σ = 7, τ = 1/81 and N = 0.3. Curves 1 are one
term approximations; curves 2 are two term approximations;
curves 3 are exact solutions of the equation (5).

Because dispersive relation (5) explicitly contains small
parameter, we can choose one of the complex conjugates
roots and express λ in the form of an asymptotic expan-
sion by the powers of ε:

λ = λ0 + ε2λ1 + ε4λ2 + ε6λ3 +

One can see (FIG. 1), that for a given mode with number
n, the growth rate is maximal for some k, which deter-
mines horizontal size of the most prominent convective
cells. Also the ﬁrst convective mode has maximal growth
rate, so that convective cells tend to be tall and thin.
Really a few ﬁrst modes have positive growth rate, but
resulting cells any way will be tall and thin, with minimal
vertical size no less than it allows maximal vertical mode
with positive growth rate at a given stratiﬁcation param-
eters. For simplicity we consider only the ﬁrst convective
mode.

Although above developed perturbation approach
gives qualitatively true estimates, for more accurate re-
sults one should immediately solve algebraic equation (5).
Rewrite it in another form, with new introduced variables
P 2 = ε2κ2

ε2k2, X = λ/P 2 and Y = N 2/P 4.

≈

(X + σ)(X + 1)(X + τ ) + Y (X + γ) = 0.

Roots of this equation depend on parameter Y , so that
ﬁnally λ depends on horizontal wave number P .

In this case ε = 1.53

Consider actual oceanographical system such as an in-
version of thermohaline staircase. Let it has thickness

lc = πεh/P∗
P∗ = 0.126, i.e.
somewhat less than the exact value.
From (6) one can extract dependence of P∗ from N , hav-
ing form P∗ = [N 2F1/(3F3)]1/4.

This result for thermohaline convection at large RS is
suﬃciently diﬀerent from that for small RS, when critical
wave number is k∗ = π/√2. For our case typical wave
numbers are of the order 0.1/ε. Thus convective cells for
large RS have tall and thin geometry from linear stability
analysis.

convection in a limit of high Hopf frequency (large RS)
in the inﬁnite horizontal layer.

Equations (12) have nontrivial solutions, describing
such phenomena as diﬀusive chaos [8] and can be used
for simulation of formation of patterns, like vertical ﬁne
structure of temperature and salinity in some areas of the
ocean, for instance, in inversions of thermohaline stair-
cases.

IV. CONCLUSION

In this article we investigated formation of vertical con-
vective patterns in two-dimensional double diﬀusive con-
vection in a limit of high Hopf frequency for an inﬁnite
horizontal layer. A physical system, corresponding to
such model is inversion of thermohaline staircase. Some
typical parameters of inversions are presented in the ta-
ble I.
It is known [9] that parameters of stratiﬁcation
in the inversions are often near the onset of convection.
Also vertical microstructure (usually step-like) are often
observed in the inversions along with small scale turbu-
lence. Results of this work are in qualitative agreement
with these observations. Developed model of ﬁne struc-
ture generation, based on ABC amplitude equations, pre-
dicts that ﬁne structure should exist in given system for

a wide range of parameters with typical time of pattern
formation of about a few hours.
It provide theoretical
base for recognition of double-diﬀusive convective struc-
tures in the ocean by diﬀerent experimental methods, like
ones of acoustic tomography.

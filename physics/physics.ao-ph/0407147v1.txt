Abstract

We reconsider the problem of the stability of the thermohaline

circulation as described by a two-dimensional Boussinesq model

with mixed boundary conditions. We determine how the stability

properties of the system depend on the intensity of the hydrologi-

cal cycle. We deﬁne a two-dimensional parameters’ space descrip-

tive of the hydrology of the system and determine, by considering

suitable quasi-static perturbations, a bounded region where mul-

tiple equilibria of the system are realized. We then focus on how

the response of the system to ﬁnite-amplitude surface freshwa-

ter forcings depends on their rate of increase. We show that it

is possible to deﬁne a robust separation between slow and fast

regimes of forcing. Such separation is obtained by singling out

an estimate of the critical growth rate for the anomalous forcing,

which can be related to the characteristic advective time scale of

the system.

1. Introduction

The thermohaline circulation (THC) plays a major role in the global circula-

tion of the oceans as pictured by the conveyor belt scheme (Weaver and Hughes

1992; Stocker 2001). The currently accepted picture is that the meridional

overturning and the associated heat and freshwater transports are energeti-

cally sustained by the action of winds and tides, controlling turbulent mix-

ing in the interior of the ocean (Munk and Wunsch 1998; Rahmstorf 2003;

Wunsch and Ferrari 2004). However, for climatic pourposes, many authors

have succesfully assumed a dependence of the strength of the THC from the

meridional gradients in the buoyancy of the water masses (Stommel 1961;

Weaver and Hughes 1992; Tziperman et al. 1994; Marotzke 1996; Rahmstorf

1996; Gnanadesikan 1999; Stocker et al. 2001).

The present day THC of the Atlantic Ocean is characterized by a strongly

asymmetric structure. Deep convection is observed at high latitudes in the

northern hemisphere. The water masses formed in the northern regions can

be followed as they cross the equator and observed as they connect with the

other major basins of the world ocean (Weaver and Hughes 1992; Rahmstorf

2000, 2002; Stocker et al. 2001). Idealized and realistic coupled GCM exper-

iments have shown that such equatorial asymmetry may be a consequence

of the large scale oceanic feedbacks leading to the existence of multiple

equilibria (Bryan 1986; Manabe and Stouﬀer 1988; Stocker and Wright 1991;

Manabe and Stouﬀer 1999a; Marotzke and Willebrand 1991; Hughes and Weaver

3

1994). The equatorial asymmetry is also responsible for a large portion of the

the global poleward heat transport (Broecker 1994; Rahmstorf and Ganopolski

1999; Stocker 2000; Stocker et al. 2001). Consequently, large climatic shifts

are often associated with important changes in the large scale oceanic cir-

culation. On a paleoclimatic perspective, major climatic shifts may be

associated with the complete shutdown of the THC (Broecker et al. 1985;

Boyle and Keigwin 1987; Keigwin et al. 19994; Rahmstorf 1995, 2002).

In fact, the THC is sensitive to changes in the climate since the North At-

lantic Deep Water (NADW) formation is aﬀected by variations in air temper-

ature and in precipitation in the Atlantic basin (Rahmstorf and Willebrand

1995; Rahmstorf 1996). With respect to the present climate change, most

GCMs have shown that the changes in radiative forcing caused by the on-

going modiﬁcation of the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could imply

a weakening of the THC. Large increases of the moisture ﬂux and/or of

the surface air temperature in the deep-water formation regions could in-

hibit the sinking of the water in the northern Atlantic (Weaver and Hughes

1992; Manabe and Stouﬀer 1993; Rahmstorf 1997, 1999b,a, 2000; Wang et al.

1999a,b). Moreover, models of diﬀerent level of complexity, from box mod-

els (Tziperman and Gildor 2002; Lucarini and Stone 2003a,b), to EMICs

(Stocker and Schmittner 1997; Schmittner and Stocker 1999) to GCMs (Stouﬀer and Manabe

1999; Manabe and Stouﬀer 1999a,b, 2000) have shown how the rate of in-

crease of forcing may be relevant for determining the response of the system.

In particular Stocker and Schmittner (1997) have performed a systematic

4

analysis of the stability of the meridional overturning circulation as a func-

tion of the climate sensitivity and of the rate of CO2 increase. However they

made no explicit reference as to the mechanism driving the response of their

coupled model.

In this work we study the THC stability using a simpliﬁed 2D Boussi-

nesq ocean model, which has been presented in Artale et al. (2002). Two-

dimensional models have been widely adopted (Cessi and Young 1992; Vellinga

1996) and have proved their ability in describing the most relevant feedbacks

of the system (Dijkstra and Neelin 1999). Moreover, the low computational

cost of such models permits extensive parametric studies. Our work wishes

to bridge both in terms of methodology and results the studies performed

with simpliﬁed models with the more physically sensible analyses performed

with EMICs and GCMs. We explicitly analyze what is the role of the rates of

changes of the hydrological forcing in determining the response of the system.

In particular we determine, for a given initial state and a given rate of increase

of the forcing, which are the thresholds in total change of the forcing beyond

which destabilization of the THC occurs. The treatment of a wide range of

temporal scales for the increase of the forcing allows us to join on naturally

and continuously (Lucarini and Stone 2003a,b) the analysis of quasi-static

perturbations, which have been usually addressed with the study of the bi-

furcations of the system (Rahmstorf 1995, 1996; Stone and Krasovskiy 1999;

Scott et al. 1999; Wang et al. 1999a; Titz et al. 2002b,a), with the study of

the eﬀects of very rapid perturbations (Rahmstorf 1996; Scott et al. 1999;

5

Wiebe and Weaver 1999), which are usually diﬀerently framed.

Our paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we provide a description

of the model we adopt in this study. In section 3 we explore the parameters

space descriptive of the hydrology of the system by considering quasi-static

perturbations. We determine which hydrological patterns are compatible

with multiple equilibria and which hydrological patterns deﬁne a unique sta-

tionary state.

In section 4 we extend the analysis to time-dependent per-

turbations. We analyze the temporal evolution of ﬁnite amplitude modiﬁca-

tions of the hydrological cycle that are able to destabilize the equilibria of

this advective system. We propose a simple relation between an estimate of

the critical rate of increase of forcing, which divides robustly slow from fast

regimes, with an estimate of the characteristic advective time scale of the

system. In section 5 we present our conclusions. In appendix A we present

the dependence of the THC strength on the value of the vertical mixing

coeﬃcient.

2. The model

We consider the two-dimensional convection equations in the Boussinesq ap-

proximation. The motion is forced by buoyancy gradients only: gravity is the

only external force, while Earth rotation is not explicitly considered. Buoy-

ancy gradients are generated in the model by imposing heat and freshwater

ﬂuxes at the top boundary. Such ﬂuxes are assumed to be representative of

6

the interactions with the overlying atmosphere.

We adopt a linearized equation of state for the sea water:

ρ (T, S) = ρ0 (1 − αT + βS)

(1)

where the values of the coeﬃcients of thermal expansion α = 8·10−4 ◦C −1 and

haline contraction β = 1.5 · 10−3psu−1 have been chosen in order to provide a

good approximation over a quite large range of salinity and temperature. The

linear approximation is commonly adopted in conceptual models. However,

we note that analyses performed on simple models show that small nonlineari-

ties may induce self-sustained oscillations for the THC (Rivin and Tziperman

1997). Such nonlinearities in the equation of state might be especially rele-

vant for the high latitude areas, since the well-known cabbeling eﬀect occurs

at low temperatures.

The geometry of the model is descriptive of the Atlantic ocean, where

we assume a depth of 5000m, an eﬀective east-west extension of 6000Km,

and a north-south extension of 13600Km (120◦) and a total volume V =

4.08×1017m3. The only active boundary of the model is the air-sea interface.

We select a relatively coarse uniform resolution with NH × NV = 64 ×

16 grid points, where NH and NV refer to the number of the horizontal

and vertical grid points, respectively, in order to meet the computational

requirements needed for performing a parametric study.

A well known property of the THC system is the existence of regimes of

7

multiple equilibria. When equatorially symmetric surface forcing is applied at

the surface, the equilibria of the system fall into three well-distinct classes.

One class is characterized by the presence of two equatorially symmetric

thermally direct cells, where the deep water is formed at high latitudes.

Another class is characterized by equatorially symmetric salinity driven cells,

where deep water is formed in the equatorial region. Equilibria belonging to

these two classes are observed when either surface thermal or haline buoyancy

forcings are largely dominant, respectively. When the two forcings have

comparable intensity, multiple equilibria regimes - which constitute a third

class - appear. In this case, the equilibria are characterized by the dominance

of one overturning cell. If also geometry is symmetric with respect to the

equator, the two equilibria have odd parity and map into each other by

exchanging the sign of the latitude.

a. Boundary conditions

The boundary condition for the sea surface salinity is deﬁned in terms of

the imposed atmospheric freshwater ﬂux F aﬀecting the surface grid box of

volume v = V / (NH × NV ):

∂tSi,j=1 = −Fi

S0
v

,

(2)

where we indicate the value of the bulk variable S at the grid point (i, j) with

Si,j and the value of the interface variable F at the grid point (i, 1) with Fi.

8

We underline that, in order to simplify the expressions, in equation (2) (and

in the following ones) we have not explicitly adopted a discrete notation for

the time variable.

We emphasize that in expression (2) we have neglected the contribution

in terms of mass of the freshwater ﬂux to the ocean (Marotzke 1996).

We divide the water basin into three distinct regions by using a suitable

analytical expression of the freshwater ﬂux. The equatorial region (region

E) is characterized by a net atmospheric export of freshwater, while the

northern and southern high latitude regions (regions N and S, respectively)

are characterized by a positive atmospheric freshwater budget. We then

consider the following functional form for the surface freshwater ﬂux:

Fi =

Φi cos (2πi/NH)

2
π

where:

ΦS,

i ≤ 1/4 NH

Φi =

ΦN ,

i ≥ 3/4 NH






ΦE = −1/2 (ΦN + ΦS) ,

1/4 NH < i < 3/4 NH

The deﬁnition of Fi is such that ΦN and ΦS are respectively the value of

the total net atmospheric freshwater ﬂuxes into regions N and S, while ΦE

is constrained in order to have conservation of the salinity of the ocean.

This latter condition is needed to allow the system to reach equilibrium

9

(3)

(4)

states. Therefore, the ocean conserves its average salinity S0 = 35 psu. Since

the atmospheric freshwater budgets for the Atlantic ocean are thought to

be positive for the regions N and S (Baumgartner and Reichel 1975), we

consider the case ΦN , ΦS ≥ 0. Three relevant examples of surface freshwater

ﬂux are depicted in ﬁgure 1.

The sea surface temperature is restored to a time-independent climato-

logical temperature ﬁeld T i with a newtonian relaxation law:

∂tTi,j=1 = λ

T i − Ti,j=1
(cid:2)

(cid:3)

(5)

where the constant λ describes the eﬃciency of the process. Such very simpli-

ﬁed ocean-atmosphere coupling (Marotzke and Stone 1995; Marotzke 1996)

synthetically describes the combined eﬀects of radiative heating-cooling and

of the atmospheric latent and sensible heat meridional transport. The clima-

tological temperature proﬁle T i proﬁle is set with the following equatorially

symmetric analytical form:

T i = T 0 − ∆T cos (2πi/NH) ,

(6)

where 2∆T is the imposed equator-to-pole temperature gradient and T 0 is

the average value of T i.

In accordance to deﬁnition of the E, N, and S

regions with respect to their atmospheric freshwater budget, we observe that

regions N and S are cold at surface, i.e. T i is lower than T 0, while the region

E is warm at surface, i.e. T i is larger than T 0.

10

Since in our work we explore the stability of the THC with respect to

the hydrology of the system, we keep ﬁxed the parameters determining the

restoring temperature proﬁle T i. We set T 0 = 15◦C, since it represents a

reasonable average surface climatological temperature, and we choose ∆T ∼

23.5◦C, which corresponds to forcing the surface equator-to-pole temperature

gradient to be ∼ 47◦C. Such a choice also implies that the average T is

∼ 0◦C in the two high latitude regions N and S and is ∼ 30◦C in the

equatorial region E. Furthermore, following the parameterization proposed

by Marotzke (1996), we choose the restoring constant λ ∼ (1y)−1, which is

reasonable for the description of the temperature relaxation of the uppermost

5000/16 m ∼ 300 m of the ocean.

3. Quasi-static hysteresis and multiple equi-

libria

a. Symmetric case: ΦS = ΦN

We start by considering the existence of a region of multiple equilibria in

the space of parameters that deﬁnes the hydrology of the system, i.e. the

(ΦS, ΦN ) plane. The surface thermal forcing is kept ﬁxed. In the space of

parameters that we are considering, symmetric forcings constitute the bisec-

trix of the (ΦS, ΦN ) plane. The allowed circulation patterns change when

adjusting the parameters along the bisectrix, as discussed in section 2. For

11

a weak hydrological cycle (ΦN = ΦS < Φinf ), we observe a stable symmetric

circulation with downwelling at high latitudes. If the hydrological cycle is

very strong (ΦN = ΦS > Φsup), we obtain a stable symmetric circulation

with downwelling of warm, saline water at the equator. In the intermediate

regimes (Φinf ≤ ΦN = ΦS ≤ Φsup), the system has multiple equilibria. For

later convenience, we deﬁne Φav ≡ 0.5 (Φinf + Φsup), which corresponds to an

average hydrological cycle. The described equilibria are depicted in ﬁgures

2a), 2b), 3a), and 3b) respectively. The two points (ΦS = Φinf , ΦN = Φinf )

and (ΦS = Φsup, ΦN = Φsup) are bifurcation points in the one-dimensional

subspace ΦN = ΦS (Dijkstra and Neelin 1999). We consider the northern

sinking equilibrium state (note that northern and southern sinking patterns

are equivalent in these terms) realized for ΦS = ΦN = Φav as the reference

state of the system.

b. General case: ΦS 6= ΦN

The study of the multiple equilibria states can be extended to the case of

non-symmetric forcings, i.e. ΦS 6= ΦN . We wish to obtain an estimate of the

shape of the domain Γ in the (ΦS, ΦN ) plane where the system has multiple

equilibria.

Since, apart from the freshwater ﬂux boundary conditions, the model is

wholly symmetric with respect to the equator, we expect that any property

of the system is invariant for exchange of ΦN and ΦS, so that we have that

12

Γ is a priori symmetric with respect to the bisectrix.

A fundamental property of the region Γ is that, if we start from a point

belonging to Γ and change quasi-statically ΦS and ΦN along a closed path so

that the point (ΦS, ΦN ) remains inside Γ, we get back to the initial equilib-

rium state. Instead, if the closed path crosses the boundary of Γ, the initial

equilibrium state may not be recovered at the end of the loop, since the ﬁnal

state depends on the path.

As a starting position of the loop, we consider a northern sinking equi-

librium corresponding to one of the stable states of the point Φinf ≤ ΦS =

ΦN ≤ Φsup on the bisectrix. By deﬁnition, such point belongs to Γ. How-

ever, the initial position of the loop - if belonging to Γ - is not relevant in

determining the shape of the region of multiple equilibria.

We increase the value of ΦN at a given slow constant rate rs over a time

t0 and then decrease it back to the initial value at the rate −rs. By slow

rate we mean that rs ≪ Φav/τ ; we select rs = Φav/100τ . If the initial state

is not recovered at the end of the integration, we deduce that the path has

crossed the boundary of Γ. By bisection, we can determine the critical value

tcrit
0

, which determines (ΦS, ΦN + rs · tcrit

0 = ΦN + ∆Φcrit

N ) as belonging to the

boundary of Γ. A schematization of this procedure is depicted in ﬁgure 4a).

By changing the initial point along the considered segment of the bisectrix,

we are able to deﬁne the whole boundary of Γ above the bisectrix with a good

degree of precision. Then, the symmetry properties of Γ allow us to easily

deduce the portion of its boundary lying below the bisectrix. In ﬁgure 5 we

13

present the estimate for the the boundary of the bistable region Γ obtained

following this strategy.

We conclude that the boundary of Γ is constituted by the bifurcation

points of the system. We note that in the more general case of the 2D

(ΦS, ΦN ) plane, (ΦS = Φinf , ΦN = Φinf ) and (ΦS = Φsup, ΦN = Φsup) result

to be cusp points (Dijkstra 2001).

4. Eﬀects of transient perturbations

The analysis we have performed captures the equilibrium properties of the

system, but is not suﬃcient to gain insight on the response of the system

to transient changes in the forcings, which in general can range from instan-

taneous to quasi-static perturbations. Such sort of problems has been ﬁrst

investigated in the seminal paper by Stocker and Schmittner (1997) with the

purpose of determining how eﬃciently the negative feedbacks of the system

can counteract external perturbations, depending on the temporal patters of

the destabilizing forcings.

In our case, it is reasonable to expect that, if we change ΦN at a ﬁnite

rate, the system can destabilize before reaching the boundary of Γ. In fact,

a fast perturbation can overcome the ability of the advective feedback to

stabilize the system. We also expect that the faster the perturbation, the

stronger such eﬀect, i.e. the smaller the total perturbation required to obtain

destabilization.

14

As in the previous case, the analysis starts by considering as initial equi-

libria the northern sinking states under symmetric forcing. In this case, we

increase the value of ΦN at a constant rate rf over a time t0, we let the

system adjust for a time 10τ , so that transients can die out, and then de-

crease ΦN back to the initial value at the slow rate −rs, corresponding to a

quasi-static change. We schematically depict such strategy for three diﬀer-

ent values of rf in ﬁgure 4b). If at the end of the process the initial state is

not recovered and southern sinking state is instead realized, the system has

made a transition to the other branch of the multiple equilibria. Depending

on the choice of rf , we obtain diﬀerent values for the critical perturbation

causing such transition. Along the lines of the quasi-static analysis, varying

the initial point, we can obtain for each value of rf a curve which describes

the critical perturbations.

In ﬁgure 6 we report the curves obtained by selecting, from fast to slow,

rf = ∞, rf = Φav/τ , rf = Φav/3τ , rf = Φav/10τ , and rf = rs = Φav/100τ .

If we select rf = rs, we obtain by deﬁnition the previously described

upper branch of the boundary of Γ depicted in ﬁgure 5, since the presence of

the relaxing time 10τ is not relevant.

On the other extreme, if we apply instantaneous changes of ΦN (rf = ∞),

we obtain information on the minimum change in ΦN that is needed to

destabilize the system for any initial state having symmetric surface forcing.

In fact, the corresponding curve is the closest to the bisectrix.

Considering intermediate values of rf , we obtain consistently that the

15

curves of the critical perturbations lye within the two extremes obtained

with rf = rs and rf = ∞. Moreover, we have that the curves are properly

ordered with respect to the value of rf , i.e. the smaller rf , the closer the

corresponding curve to the upper branch of the boundary of Γ.

Previous studies, albeit performed with coupled EMICs, obtain a qualita-

tively similar dependence of thresholds on the rate of increase of the forcings

(Stocker and Schmittner 1997; Schmittner and Stocker 1999), while in other

studies (on GCMs) where the full collapse of the THC is not obtained, it is

nevertheless observed that the higher the rate of increase of the forcing, the

larger the decrease of THC realized (Stouﬀer and Manabe 1999).

The most important result is that we can identify two separate regimes.

If the surface forcing changes with a rate faster than Φav/τ , the response of

the system is virtually identical to the case of instantaneous changes. On

the other side, if the rate of change is smaller that Φav/10τ , the response

of the system is very close to the case of quasi-static perturbations. The

curve corresponding to rf = Φav/3τ is geometrically about midway between

these two regimes and is not patched to either. We have that the response of

the system to varying external perturbations dramatically changes when the

time scale of the variation of the external forcing changes by only one order

of magnitude. Therefore, we can interpret rc = Φav/3τ as an estimate of the

critical rate of change of the hydrology of the system.

It follows that with rc we identify a relation between the class of changes

in the external forcing that distinctively aﬀect the stability of the system and

16

the internal time scale of the system.

The previous results prove to be robust with respect to changes in the

freshwater forcing of the initial states. As an example, in ﬁgure 7 we show the

results of a similar analysis referring to initial states having non-symmetric

surface freshwater forcing (ΦN = 2ΦS).

We explored the behavior of the system in the (ΦS, ΦN ) plane considering

only changes in ΦN for computational convenience. Nevertheless, coherent

results can be obtained by changing both parameters. In this case rf has to

be interpreted as the sum of the absolute values of the rates of change of the

two parameters.

Changing the parameter ∆T implies a change in the values of Φinf and

Φsup, since the meridional gradient of the total buoyancy forcing is changed.

However, the response of the THC to transient perturbations does not change

qualitatively. Instead, ﬁgures 5-7 must be rescaled linearly with the proper

values of Φsup and Φinf . Such linear relation is a direct consequence of the

use of a linearized equation of state for the sea water.

5. Conclusions

This work provides a complete analysis of the stability of the ocean system

under examination with respect to perturbation to the hydrological cycle.

We have provided a simple description of the proﬁle of the net freshwater

ﬂux into the ocean which is fully speciﬁed when only two parameters, which

17

are related to the total freshwater budget of the two high-latitudes regions,

are speciﬁed.

We have ﬁrst analyzed the bifurcations of the symmetric system, which

might be taken as the prototype of a system that has equal probabilities of

falling in two diﬀerent equilibrium conﬁgurations. We have found that the

system is characterized by two bifurcations, which delimitate a domain of

multiple equilibria.

We have then extended the study to the general case where asymmetries

in the hydrology are considered. We have produced a two-dimensional sta-

bility graph and have pointed out the presence of a region Γ where multiple

equilibria are realized. Our results summarize the information that can be

obtained with multiple hysteresis studies.

In this study we emphasize that the rate at which a perturbation in

the hydrological cycle is applied to a simple model of the THC may dra-

matically aﬀect its stability. When general time-depends perturbation to

the hydrological cycle are considered, we obtain that the shorter the time

scale of the forcing, the smaller the total perturbation required to disrupt

the initial pattern of the circulation. The observed relevance of the tempo-

ral scale of the forcing in determining the response of our system to per-

turbations aﬀecting the stability of the THC agrees with the ﬁndings of

Tziperman and Gildor (2002), Lucarini and Stone (2003a,b) for box models,

of Stocker and Schmittner (1997) and Schmittner and Stocker (1999) in the

context of EMICSs, and of (Manabe and Stouﬀer 1999a), Manabe and Stouﬀer

18

(1999b), Manabe and Stouﬀer (2000), and Stouﬀer and Manabe (1999) in

the context of GCMs. Moreover, the saturation and patching eﬀect observed

for slowly and rapidly increasing perturbations, which allows the deﬁnition

of slow and fast regimes, respectively, agrees qualitatively with the ﬁndings

of Lucarini and Stone (2003a,b) for box models, and resembles some of the

results - albeit obtained with a coupled model and considering CO2 increases

- presented in Stocker and Schmittner (1997) and in Schmittner and Stocker

(1999).

The main conceptual improvement we propose in this work is the exis-

tence of a relation between the critical rate of change of the forcing and the

characteristic advective time scale of the system.

We notice that the advective time scale results to depend on the inverse

of the square root of KV , as discussed in appendix A. Therefore, a very

important consequence of this analysis is that the eﬃciency of the vertical

mixing might be also one of the key factors determining the response of

the THC system to transient changes in the surface forcings. Future work

should speciﬁcally address the details of the functional dependence of the

critical rate on the the vertical diﬀusivity.

Other relevant improvements to the present study could be the adoption

of a more complex ocean model, descriptive of other ocean basins, as well

as the consideration of a simpliﬁed coupled atmosphere-ocean model, where

the eﬀects of the radiative forcing can be more properly represented.

Appendix A. Relevance of the vertical diﬀu-

sivity KV

The vertical diﬀusivity KV , or, equivalently, the diapycnal diﬀusivity KD, is

the critical parameter controlling the maximum THC strength Ψmax in ocean

models (Bryan 1987; Wright and Stocker 1992). On the other hand, an esti-

mate of its value in the real ocean is a subject of current research (Gregg et al.

2003). Scaling theories proposing a balance between vertical diﬀusion and ad-

vection processes suggest, in the case of three-dimensional hemispheric model

of the Atlantic ocean, a power law dependence Ψmax ∼ K

(Zhang et al.

2/3
V

1999; Dalan et al. 2004).

In the case of two-dimensional models, the ex-

pected dependence is Ψmax ∼ K
veriﬁed in our model in the range 0.6cm2s−1 < KV < 4.0cm2s−1 (ﬁgure 8).

(Knutti et al. 2000). This relation is

1/2
V

In this study, the value of KV has been selected so that the corresponding

northern sinking equilibrium state characterized by an hydrological cycle de-

termined by ΦS = ΦN = Φav has an overturning circulation ∼ 30Sv. With

this choice of KV we can deﬁne a characteristic time scale τ for the sys-

tem as τ = V /Ψmax ∼ 350y. Similarly, if we change KV over the range

shown in ﬁgure 8, the advective time-scale would range over the interval

150y < τ < 400y. These considerations will be useful in the ﬁnal discussion

of our results. Given the parameters chosen for our simulations, our model

integrations estimate Φinf ∼ 0.04Sv and Φsup ∼ 0.73Sv, so that Φav results

to be ∼ 0.39Sv.

ABSTRACT

The proposition that the tropical cyclogenesis increases with the size of the warm pool, the area
enclosed by the 26◦C SST isotherm, is tested by comparing the seasonal variation of the warm pool
area with the seasonality of the number of tropical cyclones. A non-linear relationship of high statistical
signiﬁcance is found between the area and the number of cyclones, which may explain both why there
is no linear trend in the number of cyclones over time and the recent upturn in the number of Atlantic
hurricanes.

Introduction

Benestad

After active hurricane seasons in the Atlantic/Carribean basins in 2004 and 2005, the
awareness about tropical cyclones grew in the media. Furthermore, the hurricanes sweep-
ing across the Carribean aﬀected US oil production, having ring eﬀects world wide. Thus,
indirect eﬀects from the hurricane activities could be felt as far aﬁeld as Norway. One
frequent question was: is the hurricane activity aﬀected by the global warming? High
numbers of Tropical cyclones (TCs) in the Atlantic and Caribbean during 2004 (15
named TCs) and 2005 (27 named TCs, three of which were category-5, four landfalls
caused extensive damages, and Wilma reached the highest intensity on record in the At-
lantic basin∗) have spurred further speculation of whether TCs can be aﬀected by a global
warming (Trenberth, 2005Scharroo et al., 2006Sun et al., 2006Michaels et al., 2005Knutson and Tuleya, 2005P
There have been reports of increased activity (e.g. number of TCs) in the period 1995–
2000 compared to 1971–1994 due to increases in the North Atlantic sea surface tem-
perature (SST) and decrease in wind shear (Goldenberg et al., 2001). Goldenberg et al.
posed the question whether the increased activity was due to long-term global warm-
ing or a result of natural variability, but concluded that the latter was the most likely
explanation. They argued that the recent high north Atlantic SST and reduced vertical
shear will persist for some years to come, and predicted that the high activity is likely for
subsequent 10–40 years. Three more recent studies have suggested that the potential de-
structive energy in TCs has increased since 1970 (Emanuel, 2005) and that the number of
intense cyclones has risen over the time period (Hoyos et al., 2006Webster et al., 2005).
However, the question whether there is a systematic relationship between the area of high
SST and number of TCs is still debated. Furthermore, a systematic change in the total
number of TC has not yet been established and a lack of trend may seem contrary to
expectations given a general warming trend.

Details of physical conditions and processes associated with TC formation and their
intensity are poorly known. One pressing question is whether TCs will become more
frequent in the future or more intense under a global warming as some model results
indicate an increase in intensity and near-storm precipitation rates with CO2-induced
warming (Knutson and Tuleya, 2004). Global climate models (GCMs) provide an im-
portant tool for making future climate scenarios, but these do not yet have a suﬃ-
cient spatial resolution or a representation of the physical processes within the storm to
give accurate results (Henderson-Sellers et al., 1998Jung et al., 2006). It is nevertheless
well-known that the formation of tropical cyclones requires SST greater than 26–27◦C,
whereas strong vertical wind shear in the troposphere provides unfavourable TC con-
ditions (Goldenberg et al., 2001Pearce, 2005bHenderson-Sellers et al., 1998). A remote
sensing study of hurricane Katarina-2005 suggests that the rapid increase in intensiﬁca-
tion of the hurricane was more likely due to oceanic dynamic topography, representing the
upper ocean heat content, rather than SST (Scharroo et al., 2005Scharroo et al., 2006).
A stirring of the upper ocean layers by the high winds associated with TCs bring sub-
surface water up to the surface, and high SSTs is not suﬃcient as a deep thermocline is
required to maintain high SSTs during the mixing or Ekman pumping caused by hurri-
canes. However, high SSTs are often associated with a thick upper layer of warm water
(a deep thermocline).

Henderson-Sellers et al. (1998) argue that it is a widespread misconception that the
tropical cyclogenesis increases with the area enclosed by the 26◦C SST isotherm and base
their statement on an application of a thermodynamic technique to climate change sce-

narios. However, the thermodynamic technique cited by Henderson-Sellers et al. (1998)
is tailored for the intensity of TCs rather than their frequency. The statement about the
relationship between the warm area and cyclogenesis is re-examined in the present analy-
sis through a diﬀerent data analysis approach, as Henderson-Sellers et al. (1998) do not
provide convincing evidence for why the cyclogenseis should not be sensitive to warm
pool area. Here only the frequency of tropical cyclones is examined, but the number of
cyclones does not necessarily give an adequate indication of the severity of the tropical
cyclone activity, as aspects such as trends in individual cyclone life times, intensities
(Sun et al., 2006), and spatial size have not been included in this simple analysis.

2 Methods & Data

2.1 methods

The objective of this analysis was to test the hypothesis of a systematic relationship
between the number of TCs and the area of the region where SST is greater than 26.5◦C
(here represented by the symbol A). If it can be assumed that there is no systematic
change in the atmospheric conditions, that the TCs are independent of each other, and
TC-formation can be represented by a stochastic process, then the probability of observ-
ing a TC can be expected to be proportional to A:

P r(TC|A) ∝ A,

(1)

and the number of TCs, N , is proportional to the area. Since the TCs may disturb their
own environment (winds, and SST), they are strictly not independent. It is possible that
they are clustered in time as a result of weak interactions and non-linear behaviour.
For instance, the convection associated with TCs may act to maintain low vertical wind
shear by equalising upper and lower level horizontal momentum, but TCs also remove
heat from the ocean surface through their action of vertical redistribution of heat. One
may nevertheless expect an approximate number of TCs to be proportional to A if the
probability of an event is low and few TCs coincide in time and space.

2.2 Data

Here the data on Atlantic/Caribbean (henceforth referred to as “Atlantic”) TCs (1851–
2004) was taken from the National Hurricane Center ∗, but the TC data for the north-
west Paciﬁc (1950–2003) and Indian Ocean (1971–2002) were taken from US Navy best-
tracks†. The SST was the NOAA extended reconstruction from NOAA CDC‡. The GCM
data was produced by HadCM3 (Gordon et al., 2000): a 20th Century run for the past
and the IPCC SRES A1b emission scenario for the future§.

of the area of SST exceeding a critical temperature (here taken as 26.5◦C) in the North
Atlantic (henceforth referred to as ’the warm area’) and the seasonal variation in the
Atlantic TC number both show a clear 12-month annual cycle (Figure 1a). Subscripts,
e.g. NAtl, NP ac, and NInd, are henceforth used to indicate the region represented by the
data/analysis whereas symbols with no subscripts are used for more general discussion.
An interesting observation is that there is not a one-to-one ratio between N and A.
For the Atlantic region (here AAtl was estimated over the region -80–10◦E / 0–40◦N),
there is a disproportionally high number for the month with greatest area. Thus, the
hypothesis that the number of TCs is proportional to the warm area and the number
of TCs therefore appears to be inconsistent with these results. For the northwest Paciﬁc
(here 100◦E – 150◦W / 0–30◦N), on the other hand, the annual cycle of NP ac and AP ac
exhibits more of a linear relationship, however, the peak in TC number is still narrower
than that of the warm area. Over the Indian Ocean (here 40–120◦E / 0–30◦N), the
seasonal cycle is characterised as a double peak in both AInd and NInd, indicative of a
real relationship between the two. However, the second peak in NInd is more pronounced
than the ﬁrst peak whereas for AInd the ﬁrst peak is more prominent.

The relationship between the warm surface area and the number of cyclones can
be explored further through more sophisticated statistical analysis. In order to reduce
the inﬂuence of other factors aﬀecting the signal-to-noise ratio, the mean seasonal cycle,
rather than the individual months, was used for developing a statistical model for the
relationship between number of TCs and the warm area. If the eﬀect by other inﬂuences
(e.g. the noise) follows a Gaussian distribution it will tend to cancel when taking the
average over a long interval, if these were unrelated to the seasonal cycle (such as El
Ni˜no conditions) or the SST itself. Furthermore, the low number of TC-events for each
month or each season, which in reality reﬂects a low probability P r(TC|A), hampers the
attribution analysis. An average over longer interval improves the statistical power, but
the question concerning whether the calibration is biased by other factors also exhibiting
an annual cycle but not related to SST also has to be addressed.

Atl

The logarithm of the seasonal variation in warm Atlantic surface area (x = log(A)) is
compared with the logarithm of the seasonal cycle in monthly mean number of Atlantic
TCs, NAtl (y = log(N )), and the relationship between x and y has a predominately
linear character (Figure 2; red symbols) with a linear slope suggesting NAtl ∝ A7.0±1.3
(± 2 standard deviations). The adjusted R-squared statistic for this relationship was
0.9382, with an F-statistic of 107.3 on 1 dependent variable and 6 degrees of freedom
(DF; here only the TC season is included) and a p-value of 5 × 10−05. In other words,
the linear relationship between x and y is highly signiﬁcant. The linear relationship can
be compared with those of the two other ocean basins (blue and green symbols in Figure
2), and the data representing the northwest Paciﬁc indicates similar linear relationship
between the x and y, but the slope for the northwest Paciﬁc is weaker: NP ac ∝ A4.4±0.5
(Adjusted R-squared= 0.9584, F-statistic= 254.6 on 1 and 10 DF, & p-value= 2 × 10−08).
The relationship over the Indian Ocean is weak despite the annual double peak, and
NInd ∝ A3.2±3.9
(Adjusted R-squared= 0.145, F-statistic= 2.696 on 1 and 9 DF, and p-
value= 0.135). Both the Indian Ocean and northwest Paciﬁc records are short compared
to the Atlantic record, and the annual cycles are hence more strongly aﬀected by noise.
Although the relationship between x and y for the Indian Ocean was characterised by
large scatter, their relationship ﬁt well in the general linear relationship for all ocean
basins suggesting N ∝ A3.6±0.7 (black dashed line in Figure 2; Adjusted R-squared=
0.9662, F-statistic= 315 on 1 and 10 DF, and p-value= 7 × 10−09). One reason for the
weak relationship between x and y over the Indian Ocean, and the diﬀerent magnitudes
of the annual double peak, may be that eﬀects of atmospheric conditions on TCs are

more pronounced or that the shape of region matters for TC development.

The Atlantic TC data after 1944 is thought to have higher quality than in the earlier
observations (Goldenberg et al., 2001), and a linear relationship was derived between
the seasonal cycle taken over the interval 1944–2004. Regression results for ˆym = αxm +
β, where m represents the diﬀerent months in the TC season, yielded the empirical
expression for the mean number of Atlantic TCs in terms of the Atlantic warm region
area:

NAtl ∝ A6.64±1.10

Atl

.

(2)

The linear least-squares regression analysis suggested that the p-value for this relationship
is of the order 10−5, R2=0.96, and F-statistic of 148 on 6 degrees of freedom.

So far, the possibility that other factors important for TCs also exhibiting an annual
cycle has not been ruled out. One way to isolate and assess the importance of warm sea
area with respect to N is then to apply the statistical relations derived above to predict
year-to-year variations in the seasonal mean number of TCs over an interval representing
independent data, and subsequently evaluate against the observations. This approach
is similar to one used by Michaels et al. (2005) to assess the association between SST
and the total number of annual hurricanes, however, here the SSTs (in their analysis
averaged over 10◦N–25◦N and 15◦W–80◦W) were substituted with the predicted val-
ues using expression 2 (note, the conclusions drawn here contrast with those made by
Michaels et al.). When this model was applied to mean AAtl corresponding to the hur-
ricane season (June–November) of each year over the 1944–2004 interval, a correlation
of 0.43 (p-value=0.0005, assuming independent and identically distributed data) was
achieved. For the older data (representing 1851–1943) with presumed lower quality, a
weaker correlation (0.27) was found, but it was still statistically signiﬁcant at the 1%
level (p-value=0.009). In other words, the empirical expression captures some of the year-
to-year variations in the TC numbers over the independent evaluation period. On the
other hand, a similar correlation analysis for the Northwest Paciﬁc over the independent
years 1950–1987 yielded a low correlation (r=0.14) with a p-value of 0.4137, and a neg-
ative correlation (r=-0.22) for the Indian Ocean over the interval 1971–1992 (p-value =
0.3207).

4 Discussion

It cannot be ruled out here that the correspondence between A and N seen in Figures 1
and 2 may be due to other factors than SST, as atmospheric conditions important for TC
generation may also be aﬀected by the annual cycle in a similar was as the SST. How-
ever, the independent correlation analysis carried out for the seasonal totals above for
the Atlantic/Carrebian basin suggest statistically signiﬁcant results, and both NInd and
AInd exhibit double peaks despite negative correlation for the seasonal totals. Further
work is required to discriminate the role of atmospheric processes and establish whether
atmospheric features important for TCs over the Indian Ocean follow similar bimodality.
The statistical models trained on seasonally varying values did not yield skillful predic-
tions for year-to-year variations in N for all ocean basins. The reason for the negative
correlation between predicted and observed year-to-year variations in NInd may be as-
sociated with the diﬀerent magnitudes in the double-peak structure, the weak statistical
relation, and the large scatter in seen in Figure 2. The low year-to-year correlation and
low statistical signiﬁcance for the Indian Ocean and the northwest Paciﬁc may also be
a result of lower data quality in these basins, shorter series, or due to stronger inﬂuence

from other factors such as atmospheric conditions not directly related to the warm pool
area.

There are further limitations to the data on which this analysis rests, as the TC
series should not be considered homogeneous, since the ability to detect TCs in the
open Atlantic has increased substantially over time as aircraft reconnaisance and (in
the 1970s) satellite monitoring have become available. These improvements in detection
tools have led to enhanced probability of detection of weak and remote TCs over time,
although estimated maximum potential intensities of tropical cyclones appear to show
some agreement with the observations (Henderson-Sellers et al., 1998). Using the sea-
sonal variations in A and N deﬁned over the 1944–2004 interval to some extent alliviates
problems associated with inhomogeneities in the TC record. The fact that the correlation
analysis between predictions based on equation 2 and actual observations yielded results
signiﬁcant at the 1% level for independent (older) data, provides strong support for the
statistical model established here for the Atlantic/Carribean basin.

The warm area cannot account for all the variability and other factors, such as at-
mospheric conditions, also aﬀect the number of TCs. An intriging question is whether the
annual variation of such factors are independent or aﬀected by the warm area. Increases
in the convective available potential energy (CAPE) are associated with increased near-
surface temperature (Gettleman et al., 2002), suggesting that increased warm area may
enhance convection over a greater region and hence cause a more widespread vertical
equalisation of horizontal momentum, and thus act to reduce the vertical shear. Thus,
the role TCs play in the vertical redistribution of momentum and hence their eﬀect on
the ambient atmosphere, may enhance the conditions of TC formation and growth. It
is therefore plausible that the TCs are organised in time clusters, where the presence of
one TC create conditions that may favour the genesis of other subsequent TCs, given
suﬃciently large area over which they can form. It is also plausible that a vertical mix-
ing of heat and moisture may, on the other hand, act to inhibit further TCs. Another
speculation is whether the time clustering of TCs may be associated with a modulation
of TC occurrence by the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), or conversely that the MJO
is aﬀected by the TCs.

Present analysis may point to anexplanation for why linear trends in the TC fre-
quency has not been detected in the past. We can also carry the analysis further if a
number of assumptions are made.

4.1 A conditional scenario for the future, assuming warm area

importance

If it can be assumed that the relationships between AAtl and NAtl in Figures 1 and 2
and equation 2 are not signiﬁcantly aﬀected by other factors (Hoyos et al., 2006) also
responding to the annually varying solar insolation, and these other factors being equal,
then it is possible to infer trends for the future given changes in the warm area. Since
it is unlikely that only the warm area is changing, the following scenario can only be
regarded as a loose speculation. However, this exercise may nevertheless be useful for
illustrating how dramatic the frequency of TCs may change given a non-linear depen-
dency between TCs and the ambient climate. It is most likely wrong to assume a linear
trend for the number of TCs, since we know there is a transition between TC occurrence
at the critical temperature of 26.5◦C. Analogously, there is no a priory reason to assume
that the evolution of local or regional temperatures to be linear (Benestad, 2003). More-
over, a non-linear relationship may account for a lack of trend in the historical record
(Goldenberg et al., 2001Chan and Liu, 2004) as the weak SST trend so far (Figure 3a)

Trend in number of tropical cyclones

has not yet lead to a large response in the frequency (Figure 3b). High values in AAtl
during 1930–1950, probably a consequence of natural variations, can explain the active
hurricane season during those decades. The recent upturn in the TC number, however,
may be the beginning of more frequent TCs as the tropical temperatures slowly rise,
however, on shorter time scales natural variations are also expected to modulate N . This
upturn is also predicted when equation 2 is applied to each individual TC season (not
shown) as well as the trend analysis shown in Figure 3. The data therefore suggests that
the linear log-log relationship holds for the range of values observed in the historical data.
A non-linear relationship between N and A is also concerning in the context of a
global warming, as the implication of larger warm area in the future (Figure 4a) would be
greater numbers of TCs (Figure 4b; red curve). However, it is not certain that the estab-
lished relationships will hold for values beyond the range from which they were derived,
as it is plausible eﬀects of limiting factors may kick in for larger values of A. The weaker
slope of the northwest Paciﬁc in Figure 2, may suggest a lower sensitivity to A of greater
values. If the slope α diminished with x, then a future change in A is less dramatic than
if α is constant. It is important to stress that the projection only should be regarded as
an estimate of the upper limit on the TC-frequency in a situation where great uncer-
tainties are associated with the relationship between TCs and the ambient environment
(Scharroo et al., 2006Sun et al., 2006Michaels et al., 2005Knutson and Tuleya, 2005Pearce, 2005aSmith, 2005).
Hence, Figure 4b could be regarded as a ’worst case’ scenario based on a combination
of the analysis of empirical data and a global climate model projection of the warm sea
area. Furthermore, A is limited to the size of the ocean basin and has an upper limit.

The trend analysis was repeated using the relationship established for the Paciﬁc,
N ∝ A4.4, (blue line) as well as for all basins, N ∝ A3.6±0.7, (black dashed) to explore the
sensitivity of the results to the power of A. Since AAtl is small compared to that of the
Paciﬁc, the predicted N using the Paciﬁc relation is unrealistically low for the past. Both
the expressions N ∝ A4.4 and N ∝ A3.6±0.7 suggest more moderate increases as a result
of a future warming, however, since both underestimate the present-day number of TCs,
it is questionable whether they are representative for the Atlantic. The major weakness
of the projection is that it uses statistical relations developed for the present-day climate
to extrapolate TC occurrence for future climate changes. Henderson-Sellers et al. (1998)
argued that elementary applications of empirical relationships from current climate to a
future climate are fraught with danger and oﬀer little useful insight. It is likely that a
greenhouse warming at the surface is expected to be accompanied by enhanced warming
of the upper Tropical troposphere (Houghton et al., 2001, p. 544, Fig. 9.8.a). Enhanced
warming aloft may have an important eﬀect on tropical cyclone intensiﬁcation which is
included in potential intensity theories and dynamical modeling studies using hurricane
models, but is an eﬀect that a statistical analysis of seasonal variations is unlikely to
account for (Henderson-Sellers et al., 1998). It should be stressed that the future sce-
nario presented here can only be regarded as an estimate of the upper limit of number of
TCs associated with increased warm pool size. This analysis also highlights the need for
further work required to establish whether other factors have ’contaminated’ the seasonal
correlation between the warm area and TC frequency and may play a role for the future
trends.

The fact that the slopes in Figure 2 are greater than unity may suggest that
favourable atmospheric conditions may be more frequent with greater warm area. Yet,
another question is whether processes that may trigger TC genesis are unaﬀected by the
warm area and hence serve as a limiting factor for the number of TCs. Another posibility
is that the probability is not constant above the critical temperature, but increases with
SST. On the other hand, it may be argued that some global modeling studies indicate

8

Benestad

that the region of strong tropical convection, and of tropical storm formation, does not
simply expand with some given isotherm (e.g., 26◦C) but rather the ”critical tempera-
ture” increases to a higher value in the uniformly warmer climate (e.g., ∼29◦C for a 3◦C
increase in the global mean surface temperature). Henderson-Sellers et al. (1998) argue
that the region of cyclogenesis will not expand with the 26◦C isotherm.

In this analysis, the distinction between the absolute value of SSTs and SST gradi-
ents has been neglected. If the SST is elevated uniformly everywhere, then the gradients
remain unchanged, unlike the seasonal variations in the SST pattern. A comparison be-
tween projected SST-change in the HadCM3 model does not indicate that SST gradients
in the Tropics will change signiﬁcantly (not shown). During the seasonal cycle, the re-
gion of warm water migrates north and south with the seasonal cycle of insolation, and
the TC formation and tropical convection regions migrate with it. The areas of warmest
SSTs, relative to surrounding regions, tend to have the more active convection than the
cooler regions. One argument is that there are ”winners and losers” in the tropics in
terms of convection and that the warmer regions win out over cooler regions. Physically,
the overall control is provided not by absolute SST values, but by the large scale circu-
lation (i.e., the rising and sinking regions of the Hadley and Walker Circulations) which
through subsidence act to limit convection in the relatively cooler regions. However, it
is also well-known that the atmosphere and the ocean are closely coupled in the tropics,
giving rise to phenomena like the El Ni˜no Southern Oscillation.

5 Conclusion

In summary, this paper does not attempt to provide a rigorous physical basis for the
highly nonlinear SST-dependent behaviour. Instead, empirical evidence is analysed to
assess the relationship between the number of TCs and the area of SST > 26.5◦C. It is not
possible to even evaluate whether it would be likely to apply in the situation of large-scale
SST warming. Nevertheless, a tentative projection has been made for the future, keeping
in mind the caveats and uncertainties associated with such statistical extrapolations.
The prediction of a rapidly increasing number of TCs after a certain area rests on the
assumption that the statistical relations developed to model the seasonal variation of TC
frequency can be extrapolated and used with the projected changes in future SSTs, but
it is uncertain whether the statistical relation will hold for new conditions signiﬁcantly
diﬀerent from the past. The relationship found here may be more complicated than it
ﬁrst appears, as other conditions also undergoing similar annual cycles may introduce
misleading biases in the end results. On the other hand, factors other than SST that
may aﬀect TCs are most likely not independent of the SSTs (shear, humidity, CAPE, El
Ni˜no, etc.), so that the area of the warm sea may also be regarded as proxy for all these
aspects. The correlation analyses between predictions and year-to-year variations in the
seasonal mean TC-number suggest that the statistical models capture a good part of the
variations over the Atlantic and Caribbean basins, but not over the Indian ocean and
the Paciﬁc.

In concusion, these results are inconsistent with TCs being purely stochastic pro-
cesses taking place over warm ocean regions. The statistical model may, however, explain
the lack of a linear trend in N in the past, despite a general increase in A. Furthermore,
these results provide strong evidence for a real connection between N and A and against
the claim that the region of cyclogenesis will not expand with the 26◦C isotherm. Thus,
strong empirical evidence is presented here which suggest that the claim that the tropical
cyclogenesis does not increases with the area enclosed by the 26◦C SST isotherm is false.

These results furthermore suggest that there may be a non-linear relationship between
the area of high SST and the number of TCs, which can explain why there has not yet
been a clear upward trend in the number of TCs.

to GRL/Climate Research - some of the arguments are acknoledged and met, whereas
other comments were considered not convincing (despite coming from prominent experts
within the tropical cyclone research community). Hence, this manuscript has beneﬁt-
ted from comments from several reviewers. Here, empirical data and relationships are
presented, with the exception of the projection into the future (to be considered as an es-
timate of the upper bound for the number of TCs), and these empirical data/relationship
ought to either support or falsify current hypotheses/theories, not vice versa. This prin-
ciple is important, especially in the light of the current debate surrounding central is-
sues regarding TCs, their relationship with global warming, or relationship with SSTs
(Scharroo et al., 2006Sun et al., 2006Michaels et al., 2005Knutson and Tuleya, 2005Pearce, 2005aSmith, 2005).
It is acknowledged that the projection for the future is contriversial, however it is included
to illustrate possible risks associated with uncertain knowledge about relationships be-
tween number of TCs and the ambient environment.

Abstract

The cause of the glacial cycles remains a mystery. The origin is widely accepted to be
astronomical since paleoclimatic archives contain strong spectral components that match
the frequencies of Earth’s orbital modulation. Milankovitch insolation theory contains sim-
ilar frequencies and has become established as the standard model of the glacial cycles.
However, high precision paleoclimatic data have revealed serious discrepancies with the
Milankovitch model that fundamentally challenge its validity and re-open the question of
what causes the glacial cycles. We propose here that the ice ages are initially driven not
by insolation cycles but by cosmic ray changes, probably through their effect on clouds.
This conclusion is based on a wide range of evidence, including results presented here on
speleothem growth in caves in Austria and Oman, and on a record of cosmic ray ﬂux over
the past 220 kyr obtained from the 10Be composition of deep-ocean sediments.

1 INTRODUCTION

The most important clue for identifying the cause of glacial cycles is the spectral purity of their peri-
odicity, as recorded in δ18O, a proxy for global ice volume [1]. For the past million years, the glacial
pattern is dominated by a precise 100 kyr cycle, and for the million years before that, by an equally
precise 41 kyr cycle. These match the major frequencies of Earth’s orbital changes, and so it is generally
accepted that the primary driver for past climate change was astronomical. A linkage between orbit and
climate is provided by the Milankovitch model, which states that melting of the northern ice sheets is
driven by peaks in Northern Hemisphere summer insolation (solar heating). The insolation model has
gained widespread acceptance since it naturally includes spectral components at the orbital modulation
frequencies.

However, as better data have become available, difﬁculties have arisen with the Milankovitch
model. Insolation, by itself, includes a 41 kyr cycle but no signiﬁcant 100 kyr variation and so, to enhance
it, a nonlinear response of climate to insolation forcing has been postulated [2, 3, 4]. An expected
400 kyr cycle is not observed, and so it is simply assumed to be suppressed. The modulation of the
100 kyr cycles does not follow the expected pattern—a disagreement known as the “Stage-11 problem”,
when a major glacial termination occurred during a period of minor insolation changes around 400 kyr
BP (before present) [5]. A similar “Stage-1 problem” occurred recently [3]. High-resolution spectral
analysis of the glacial records shows a narrow 100 kyr cycle, in conﬂict with the double peak expected
from the Milankovitch model [6]. Finally, the penultimate glacial termination appears to have preceded
the insolation increase that is supposed to have caused it—a conﬂict known as the “causality problem”
[7, 8]. Various ad hoc solutions have been suggested for each of these problems on a case-by-case basis,
but no common explanation has been found [9].

In this paper we propose that the glacial cycles, rather than being driven by insolation cycles as in
the present standard model, are initially driven by cosmic ray changes, probably through their effects on
clouds. There is a wide range of evidence that supports this model, although some of it is disputed. The
evidence, in chronological order, comprises:

1. Svensmark et al. [10] show a correlation between cloud cover and variations of cosmic ray ﬂux.
These correlations, based on data from satellites and neutron monitors over the last two decades,
have been subjected to intense scrutiny and criticism [11]. New analysis by Marsh and Svensmark
[12] support the original conclusion; however an analysis by Rohde et al. [13] shows that the ef-
fect may be more complicated than previously reported. An increased ﬂux of galactic cosmic rays
(GCRs) is associated with increased low cloud cover, and therefore a cooler climate. Mechanisms
that could link cloud cover to cosmic radiation have been proposed, although none is experimen-
tally established [14, 15, 16]. Clouds are known to exert a strong effect on Earth’s radiative energy
balance (cloud cover reduces ground-level radiation by a global average of about 30 W/m2, or
13% of the ground-level solar irradiance), and so small changes would be climatically signiﬁcant.
Furthermore a secular change of cloud cover would cause a net change in total ground-level insola-
tion, whereas Milankovitch cycles result in no change of total insolation, but rather in a latitudinal
and seasonal redistribution.

2. There is growing evidence for close links between climate changes in the Holocene (approximately
the last 10 kyr) and variations of the cosmic ray ﬂux (see, for example, [17, 18, 19]). A high
GCR ﬂux is associated with a cold climate, and a low ﬂux with a warm climate. On these 100 yr
timescales, variations of the cosmic ray ﬂux are thought to reﬂect changing solar activity (increased
solar magnetic activity reduces the GCR ﬂux). However, recent high-resolution paleomagnetic
studies suggest that short-term geomagnetic variability may in fact control a signiﬁcant fraction
of the GCR modulation within the Holocene, even on 100 yr timescales [20]. Moreover, we will
present evidence here that shows climate changes are also linked to variations of the cosmic ray
ﬂux caused by changes of geomagnetism. This indicates that GCRs directly inﬂuence the climate,

1

rather than merely serve as a proxy for solar variability. We note, however, that the brief Laschamp
event (37–40 kyr BP), when the geomagnetic ﬁeld dropped to a low value, produced no evidence
of climate change in the GRIP (Greenland) ice core [21], although a pronounced reduction of the
East Asia monsoon was registered in Hulu Cave, China [22].

3. Recent measurements suggest that long-term records of variations of Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld—in
both strength and magnetic inclination—show the presence of orbital frequencies [23, 24]. The
effects persist when the archives are corrected for climatic inﬂuences. The 800 kyr record known as
Sint-800 [25] is reported to show no such cycles; however we will present a new analysis here that
shows such cycles are in fact present in this record. It is perhaps surprising that orbital variations
could modulate the Earth’s dipole ﬁeld, but we will argue that such a linkage is plausible.
In
addition, we will discuss other mechanisms that could link orbital variations to changes of cosmic
radiation.

4. We present a new spectral analysis of the cosmic ray ﬂux recorded in the 10Be content of deep
ocean sediments, which shows the presence of orbital cycles. Furthermore we present additional
results based on this 10Be record and on precisely-dated speleothems that reinforce the causality
problem with the Milankovitch model and support our conclusion that cosmic rays appear to be
driving the glacial cycles.

Bond et al. [17, 18] have shown a strong correlation between ice-rafted-debris (IRD) events in the
North Atlantic and increased GCR ﬂuxes (measured both by 10Be and 14C) during the last 12 kyr. They
assumed that the cause of the IRD events was reduced solar irradiance, and that the GCR ﬂuxes simply
provided a solar proxy. The Little Ice Age around the 17th century appears to be the most recent of about
10 such centennial-scale events during the Holocene [18], when North Atlantic sea surface temperatures
fell by around 2◦C in association with spells of anomalously high GCR ﬂux (around +20%). Remarkably,
the IRD events extend beyond the Holocene and into the last glaciation to at least 30 kyr BP, maintaining
variability on a similar kilo-year timescale but with larger amplitude of debris [17]. This argues against a
primary internal trigger such as ice sheet dynamics since the climate conditions varied a great deal over
this interval.

Several previous studies have noted similarities between glacial climate records and variations
of GCRs or paleomagnetism. Sharma [26] proposed that variations of solar activity control the glacial
cycles. Kok [27] interpreted the climate signal in the paleomagnetic data as evidence for inadequate
correction of climatic effects on the archive deposition rates. On much longer timescales, up to 1 Gyr,
Shaviv [28] reported evidence for the occurrence of ice-age epochs on Earth during crossings of the
solar system with the galactic spiral-arms, when elevated GCR ﬂuxes are expected. This observation has
recently been further supported by Shaviv and Veizer [29], who ﬁnd a strong correlation between the
GCR ﬂux and reconstructed ocean temperatures during the Phanerozoic (past 550 Myr) [30]. Although
these and other observations have been interpreted in diverse ways, we suggest that each is consistent
with a single explanation, namely a direct effect on the climate by cosmic rays.

2 COSMIC RAY RECORD AND TIMING OF THE GLACIAL CYCLES

On reaching Earth, cosmic rays interact with nuclei in the atmosphere, creating showers of secondary
particles, and dissipating energy by ionization. Among the products are light radioisotopes, notably 14C
and 10Be, which settle on the surface of Earth either via the carbon cycle (14CO2) or in rain and snow
(10Be). Since this is their only terrestrial source, the resultant archives of light radioisotopes found in tree
rings, ice cores and marine sediments provide records of the past GCR ﬂux. For the long-lifetime 10Be
these records extend back over several hundred thousand years. To determine the GCR ﬂux, each archive
must ﬁrst be corrected for transport effects. In the case of 10Be in deep-sea sediments, there are three
main effects: (i) sediment redistribution and rate variation, (ii) boundary scavenging and (iii) variable

2

ocean water circulation. It has been shown that the effects of sediment redistribution and rate variation
can be corrected by normalizing 10Be to 230Th concentrations, yielding vertical settling rates into the
sediments [31]. Boundary scavenging and ocean water circulation effects are quantiﬁed and corrected
by modeling the transport of 10Be at the particular location of the archive [32].

Christl, Strobl, and Mangini [33] have recently reconstructed the global 10Be production rate
during the last 220 kyr using combined sediment cores from the Paciﬁc, Atlantic and Southern Oceans
(Fig. 1a). The data were corrected for sediment redistribution and rate variation, and boundary scavenging—
including glacial/interglacial variations. The timescale is based on the SPECMAP stacked δ18O record
[34], which is tuned to precession and obliquity, and agrees with the 65◦N insolation cycles within an
accuracy of about 5 kyr over this 200 kyr range. An advantage of deep ocean sediment cores for the work
presented here is the long residence time of 10Be before settling (about 1 kyr). This reduces sensitivity
to regional variations of production or deposition, and ensures a measurement of global GCR ﬂux. In
contrast, the atmospheric settling time of 10Be into ice core archives is much shorter (between 1 wk and
1 yr).

The 10Be ﬂux is modulated by both the geomagnetic ﬁeld and the solar wind. However, assuming
for the moment that all variations on these long timescales are of geomagnetic origin, we can calculate
the corresponding values of Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld [35]. These are shown in Fig. 1b), along with several
recent geomagnetic reconstructions for comparison, based on 10Be in ocean sediments [36] and ice cores
[37], or paleointensity proxies derived from magnetic materials [24, 25]. To compensate for depositional
variations due to climate, the paleointensity proxies are constructed by normalizing the natural remnant
magnetization (NRM) by either the isothermal remnant magnetization (IRM) or the anhysteric remnant
magnetization (ARM) [38].

All data broadly agree that the geomagnetic ﬁeld over the last 200 kyr was generally lower than
at present, and displayed considerable variability on millennial timescales or greater. However, there
is only qualitative-to-poor agreement on the detailed structure. In particular, discrepancies in the 110–
190 kyr region within the NRM-based and the 10Be-based reconstructions suggest either regional effects
or experimental errors. An additional potential difference between the NRM and 10Be reconstructions is
long-term solar variability, which directly affects only the 10Be data. For example, the increase of global
GCR ﬂux due to a low relative geomagnetic ﬁeld of 0.6 could be cancelled by a high mean solar activity,
approximately equal to present solar maxima (e.g. 1991) [35].

Our measurements of 10Be production (Fig. 1a) show that the GCR ﬂux over the last 220 kyr
was generally around 20–40% higher than today, due to a reduced geomagnetic ﬁeld. However there
were several relatively short periods when the GCR ﬂux returned to present levels or, less frequently,
increased further. We have compared this GCR record with paleoclimatic data from stalagmites obtained
in northern Oman and the central Alps. The growth of stalagmites at each of these locations is especially
sensitive to climate since it requires a climate at least as warm as today’s. In the case of Hoti Cave,
Oman, water availability requires a warm climate and monsoon rains brought by a northward shift of the
Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) in summer [39]. Our studies of speleothems from Hoti Cave
have shown that the ITCZ in Oman is strongly inﬂuenced during the Holocene by solar/GCR variability
[19]. The second cave, Spannagel, is situated at 2,500 m altitude in the Zillertal Alps, Austria, where the
present mean air temperature is (1.5±1)◦C [40]. Stalagmites will not grow if the mean temperature falls
below 0◦C because of permafrost. The stalagmite samples are precisely dated by U/Th analysis to a 2σ
precision of 1 kyr (Spannagel) or 4 kyr (Hoti).

In Fig. 2 we compare the stalagmite growth periods with the GCR ﬂux and the 65◦N June insola-
tion. We observe that most growth in Spannagel Cave occurs during intervals of low GCR ﬂux (Fig. 2b).
The growth periods are 0–10, 47–59, 71–83, 116–122, 127–136, 183–190 and 195–204 kyr BP. In four
of the ﬁve well-separated growth intervals in Spannagel Cave we also observe growth of stalagmites in
Hoti Cave (0.2–2.8, 5.5–10.7, 78–82, 113–134 and 180–197 kyr BP).

In contrast, the stalagmite growth periods show no clear pattern of association with 65◦N June

insolation (Fig. 2a). Growth would be expected to start around the time of insolation maxima, such as
occurred for the ﬁnal three periods starting at 10, 59 and 83 kyr. However, at 136 and 204 kyr, the growth
begins near the insolation minima—and the earlier growth period is interrupted and then re-commences
at 190 kyr, also near an insolation minimum. It is therefore difﬁcult to attribute the warm growth periods
at these two sensitive locations to northern summer insolation forcing.

In Fig. 3, we examine the timing of Termination II in more detail. The 10Be data show that the GCR
ﬂux began to decrease around 150 kyr, and it had reached present levels by about 135 kyr. The growth
period of stalagmite SPA 52 from Spannagel Cave began at 135±1.2 kyr. So, by that time, temperatures
in central Europe were within (1.5±1)◦C of the present day. This corroborates Henderson and Slowey’s
conclusion, based on sediment cores off the Bahamas, that warming was well underway at 135±2.5 kyr
[41]. Furthermore, dating of a Barbados coral terrace shows that the sea level had risen to within 20%
of its peak value by 135.8±0.8 kyr [42]. These results conﬁrm the “early” timing of Termination II,
originally discovered at Devils Hole Cave, Nevada [43]. We conclude that the warming at the end of the
penultimate ice age was underway at the minimum of 65◦N June insolation, and essentially complete
about 8 kyr prior to the insolation maximum.

Based on an analysis of deep ocean cores, Visser et al. [44] have recently reported that warming
of the tropical Paciﬁc Ocean during Termination II preceded the northern ice sheet melting by 2–3 kyr.
Both their data and our GCR record are adjusted to the SPECMAP δ18O timescale [34] which is in turn
tuned to the insolation cycles. Relaxing this constraint, we have adjusted the timescales (earlier by 8 kyr)
of both the Visser et al. data and our GCR record to agree with the precisely- and independently-dated

δ18O records. The GCR rate and the Visser et al. data are shifted earlier by 8kyr in order to correct for estimated
systematic errors in the SPECMAP timescale, on which they are based. The growth periods of stalagmite SPA 52

dramatically underscores the causality problem facing the Milankovitch model. All data, however, are
compatible with Termination II being driven by a reduction of cosmic ray ﬂux. We note that a similar
reduction of GCR ﬂux also occurred at Termination I due to a rise in geomagnetic ﬁeld strength that
started around 20 kyr BP [45], coincident with the ﬁrst signs of warming at the end of the last glaciation
[46].

3 SPECTRAL ANALYSES OF GEOMAGNETISM AND COSMIC RAY FLUX

There is a long history of papers reporting orbital signals in records of Earth’s magnetism, and an equally
long history of papers disputing those claims. In this section, we’ll review only the recent history from
1998 until the present. All of these papers applied the Blackman-Tukey method [47], mostly using
the AnalySeries software package [48]. Unfortunately, none reported the key “lag” parameter of this
program, so we assume the default value of 1/3 was used, whereas it should be varied between 0 and 1 in
order to ﬁnd the optimum value of resolution while still compensating for uncertainties in timescale. We
have therefore repeated the spectral analyses of each of these papers to conﬁrm the original conclusions
[49].

In 1998, Channell et al. [23] measured the geomagnetic paleointensity from two sea-ﬂoor cores,
ODP Sites 983 (to 720 ka) and 984 (to 430 ka). Their spectral analyses showed two strong spectral peaks
corresponding to 100 kyr and 41 kyr, which match orbital and climate periodicities. To be cautious,
they claimed unambiguous discovery only of the 41 kyr cycle. Our reanalysis of their data conﬁrms the
statistical signiﬁcance of a 100 kyr peak. In Fig. 4 we show our estimate of the spectral power for the
paleointensity (mean NRM/IRM) of site 983. There is a strong peak at 0.01 c/kyr (period 100 kyr), and
power near 0.024 c/kyr (41 kyr) that is statistically signiﬁcant at the 95% CL. For comparison, we plot
the spectral power for δ18O in the benthic stack of Karner et al. [50]. The correlation they report between
the 100 kyr cycle in paleointensity and in IRM shows that some of the 100 kyr signal may be spurious.
This is a cautious conclusion; a large part of the 100 kyr signal may still be magnetic. The presence of
the 100 and 41 kyr periods is robust. We have reanalyzed the data with a series of windows (Bartlett,
Hanning, Welch, Chebyshev, and others), and with the Maximum Entropy method; the strength of the
two lines persists. Furthermore, when the data are split into two consecutive time periods, the two peaks
are present in both halves.

In 1999, Guyodo and Valet [25] published a stack of 33 globally-distributed paleointensity records,
named Sint-800 (since it goes back 800 kyr). They concluded from their spectral analysis that Sint-800
does not indicate the presence of any dominant periodicity [51]. In Fig. 5a) we show a periodogram of
Sint-800. The rapid variations in the low frequency region, 0–0.02 c/kyr, suggest an inaccurate timescale.
A 5% error in the Sint-800 data at 800 kyr (from Fig. 2 in [25]) amounts to 40 kyr—enough to cancel
not only a 41 kyr cycle but also a 100 kyr cycle. In Figs. 5b) and c) we therefore show periodograms of
Sint-800 separately for 0–400 kyr and 400–800 kyr, with both ﬂat and Hanning windows [3]. (A similar
analysis was made in [25], but with lower resolution than either of our methods.) The 0–400 kyr period
shows a strong peak at 0.01 c/kyr. There is a smaller peak near 0.024 c/kyr. The 400–800 kyr period
shows no signiﬁcant structure; the power below 0.02 c/kyr is similar to the ‘red’ (low frequency) noise
that one expects when no strong periodicity is present—or when there are timescale errors. In summary,
our analysis shows that a strong 100 kyr cycle is present in the ﬁrst half of Sint-800; the 41 kyr cycle is
more sensitive to timescale errors and may have cancelled out. We conclude that the absence of Earth’s
orbital frequencies in the full Sint-800 record could be due to an inaccurate timescale.

Fig. 5: Spectral powers of the Sint-800 paleointensity record [25]: a) 0–800 kyr, b) 0–400 kyr and c) 400–800 kyr.
The dashed lines are the spectra when a Hanning ﬁlter is applied to the data; such a ﬁlter broadens peaks by a factor
of about 1.5, but smooths unphysical ﬂuctuations that arise from the abrupt termination of the records.

In 2002, Yamazaki and Oda presented measurements of the intensity and direction of Earth’s
magnetic ﬁeld back to 2.25 Myr BP, and reported discovery of a 100 kyr periodicity in inclination [24].
A measurement of magnetic inclination has the advantage that it does not require compensation for
sedimentation rate; all it needs is a good timescale. In Fig. 6 we show a periodogram of their inclination
record for 0–2.25 Myr. The highest peak is near 0.01 c/kyr, with a height of 6.6. The mean in the region
0–0.2 c/kyr is 1.1; thus the peak is a factor of 6 above background. Since there are about 60 independent
frequencies in the plot, the probability of a random peak of this magnitude is 60 e−6 = 0.15, yielding
signiﬁcance at 85% CL. However, since the 100 kyr period is of interest a priori, one can ask if there
is signiﬁcant power in this region alone (within 10% of the 100 kyr period). Since there are only 2
independent frequencies in this region, the probability of such a random ﬂuctuation becomes 2 e−6 =
0.005, making the peak signiﬁcant at 99.5% CL. Thus, we agree with the conclusion of Yamazaki and
Oda that such a period is present. However, we note that the area under the 100 kyr region is small; the
100 kyr period accounts for only 8% of the variance.

In Fig. 7 we show a periodogram of the GCR ﬂux during the last 220 kyr (from Fig. 1a). Although
the resolution is poor (wide peaks) because of the short record, it is nevertheless adequate to test for

inclination, 0–2.25 Myr [24].

the presence of orbital cycles. The two strongest peaks are consistent with the frequencies reported in
the geomagnetic records, namely 0.01 c/kyr (100 kyr period) and 0.024 c/kyr (41 kyr). The frequency
match is not perfect, but neither should it be; Monte Carlo simulations show that the frequency estimate
has a standard error approximately equal to the half-width at half-maximum [3]. We ﬁnd the strengths
of these two peaks are insensitive to possible systematic effects resulting from the reduced time range
(10–160 kyr) of one of the 4 records that comprise the 10Be stack [33].

We conclude that there is suggestive evidence that Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld and the GCR ﬂux have
components that vary with orbital frequencies. Various methods have been used to reduce the danger
that climate variations could simulate changes of the Earth’s ﬁeld or of the 10Be ﬂux, e.g. through vari-
ations in the concentration of remanence-carrying grains or variations in sedimentation rate. (We note,
moreover, that sedimentation rates determined by orbital tuning have never shown 100 or 41 kyr periods
[3]. Furthermore, at least one of the proxies—magnetic inclination—is unaffected by these systematic
problems.) Even though the presence of such signals is not deﬁnitive, we suggest that previous conclu-
sions that orbital frequencies are absent were premature. The most robust signal is the 100 kyr cycle,
although there is some evidence for a 41 kyr cycle. Inaccurate timescales tend to hide such periodicity;
a 20 kyr error could cancel a 41 kyr period, and a 50 kyr error could cancel the 100 kyr period. The
100 kyr period could be due to either orbital eccentricity or orbital inclination; the 41 kyr period could
be due to obliquity (the tilt of Earth’s pole). The presence of such frequencies was not predicted and the
cause of the linkage is not obvious. We will discuss several possible explanations in the next section.

4 COSMIC RAY MODULATION

The GCR ﬂux incident on Earth’s atmosphere is modulated by three processes: a) variations of the
solar wind within the heliosphere (on 10–1000 yr timescales, and possibly longer), b) variations of
Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld (100–10,000 yr), and c) variations of the interstellar ﬂux outside the heliosphere
(>10 Myr). On entering the heliosphere, GCRs sense the heliospheric magnetic ﬁeld (HMF) of the solar
wind, about which they spiral [52]. To reach Earth they must overcome the effects of outward convection
and irregularities in the HMF, which impose a random walk on the particle motion.
In addition to
convection and diffusion, the GCRs undergo coherent drift motion in the large-scale ordered structure
of the HMF. On reaching Earth, cosmic rays must traverse the geomagnetic ﬁeld to reach the lower

9

atmosphere. In consequence, the GCR intensity is about a factor 4 higher at the poles than at the equator,
and there is a more marked solar cycle variation at higher latitudes.

The GCR ﬂux over these different timescales varies by between 15% during the 11 yr solar cycle,
to as much as a factor 2 increase during periods of low geomagnetic ﬁeld and low solar activity. Inter-
stellar modulations of the GCR ﬂux are estimated to be between -75% and +35% of present values [28]
on cosmological timescales, corresponding to the 140 Myr crossing period of the solar system with the
spiral arms of the Milky Way (where the peak ﬂuxes probably reside). Nearby supernovae could increase
the GCR ﬂuxes above these values. In summary, if the cosmic ray-climate connection is causal, then the
climate appears to be remarkably sensitive to quite small secular changes of GCR intensity—of around
10% or so.

There are two requirements that underpin the proposed GCR model for the glacial cycles: 1) the
existence of a plausible mechanism by which GCRs exert a signiﬁcant effect on the climate, and 2) the
existence of a plausible mechanism by which the GCR ﬂux is orbitally modulated. At this stage, neither
requirement need be proved—nor indeed can be. It is nevertheless of value to propose a model based on
physics since it leads to predictions that can be tested.

The ﬁrst requirement is satisﬁed by the cosmic ray-cloud interaction suggested by satellite obser-
vations [10]. If a causal mechanism is conﬁrmed, this could provide an effective initial step by which
an energetically-weak GCR signal (which is roughly equivalent to that of starlight) is ampliﬁed into a
signiﬁcant climate forcing. Physical mechanisms connecting GCRs with clouds and thunderstorms have
been proposed [16, 53], including: a) ion-induced cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) production [15, 54],
b) electrofreezing of supercooled liquid droplets [14], c) direct effects on thunderstorm electrical pro-
cesses, and d) inﬂuences on the global electrical circuit. However most of the associated microphysical
processes have yet to be investigated experimentally and quantiﬁed.

Mechanisms for the second requirement are more speculative. Although we are unable to account
for a 100 kyr cycle in the GCR ﬂux, we can imagine two potential mechanisms: 1) orbital modulation of
the geodynamo and hence of the geomagnetic ﬁeld strength and direction, and 2) correlations of orbital
parameters with the solar wind shielding in the heliosphere.

A physical mechanism that could in principle link orbital gravitational forces to the geodynamo
is a difference in the precessional torques on Earth’s mantle and its solid iron core, which are separated
by a liquid iron outer core [55]. It is the motion of the liquid core that is thought to be responsible
for the geodynamo, so any relative motion induced between the mantle and inner core would affect the
geomagnetic ﬁeld. Orbital modulation of the geodynamo has some experimental support, as described
above. We remark that a GCR-cloud-climate effect may depend not only on the globally-averaged GCR
ﬂux but, in particular, on its variation at low latitudes. In this case, variations in declination must also be
considered since they could produce signiﬁcant latitudinal variations without any change in overall geo-
magnetic ﬁeld strength. We also note that low latitudes are where geomagnetic variations most strongly
affect the GCR ﬂuxes (in contrast with solar modulation, which is more important at high latitudes).

The second mechanism would require the GCR ﬂux to have a signiﬁcant heliographic latitudinal
dependence. Muller and MacDonald [6] have shown that the inclination of Earth’s orbital plane varies
with a 100 kyr period by up to 3 degrees relative to its average position. If the average GCR ﬂux had a
signiﬁcant heliographic latitudinal dependence then this could introduce a 100 kyr modulation compo-
nent. Cosmic ray modulation in the heliosphere is characterized by a dominance of transient disturbances
during solar maximum and, during solar minimum, of large-scale drifts in the HMF and wavy current
sheet [56]. Measurements by Ulysses [56] out of the ecliptic have shown latitudinal gradients consistent
with zero at solar maximum, and a small but ﬁnite gradient at solar minimum of about +0.2% /degree
(and up to +1% /degree close to the ecliptic) [57]. To be signiﬁcant, a stronger latitudinal gradient would
be required, implying a magnetically-quiet Sun and a thin equatorial heliospheric current sheet. There
is some indirect evidence that this could occur. The existence of the Maunder Minimum (and its ten
cousins earlier in the Holocene) has demonstrated that the Sun can enter a quiet state for about 100 years

characterized by periodic polarity reversals but an almost complete absence of magnetic disturbances
(few sunspots or aurorae). These conditions produce higher GCR ﬂuxes and may also give rise to in-
creased latitudinal gradients. The open question is whether the Sun could remain in such a state for
longer periods, which may be sufﬁcient to trigger a glaciation in association with a “favourable” orbital
enhancement of the GCR ﬂux.

5 CONCLUSIONS

We are proposing a new model for the glacial cycles in which the forcing mechanism is due to galactic
cosmic rays, probably through their effect on clouds. We are led to this conclusion from the accumulated
experimental evidence of the last few years as well as new results presented here on a 220 kyr record
of GCR ﬂux obtained in deep-ocean sediments. Although the evidence is sufﬁcient to propose the GCR
model for the glacial cycles, it is clearly insufﬁcient to establish it. Nevertheless the model makes deﬁnite
predictions that can be tested by further observations and experiments.

The ﬁrst area to be tested concerns the paleo record of GCR ﬂux, its orbital components and asso-
ciation with climate change. Further 10Be measurements in sediment cores are required, over longer time
spans and with improved precision and dating. Parallel improvements are required for paleomagnetic in-
tensity and direction in order to study the orbital components and to separate solar and geomagnetic
effects in the 10Be record. Orbital inﬂuences on the geomagnetic ﬁeld should be modeled. Further
satellite data on GCR/solar wind characteristics in the heliosphere are required, both in and out of the
ecliptic, and during different periods of solar magnetic activity. GCR transport in the heliosphere for a
magnetically quiet Sun (Maunder Minimum) should be modeled to estimate the expected magnitude of
orbital variations of the GCR ﬂux.

The second area to be tested concerns the interactions of GCRs with Earth’s clouds and climate.
Improved and extended satellite observations of clouds are needed. Investigations are required on the
effects of GCRs on clouds and thunderstorms, including ion-induced CCN production, electrofreezing
of supercooled liquid droplets and atmospheric electrical processes. The microphysics of GCR-cloud-
climate interactions should be investigated in laboratory experiments under controlled conditions, and the
results applied to models and ﬁeld observations. Combined interdisciplinary efforts in these directions
may quite quickly be able to establish whether or not the GCR model for the glacial cycles is further
supported, and where more work is needed to quantify its physical basis.

[1] The physical basis for proxy climate measurements from the stable 18O isotope is that the vapour
16O. Evaporation from the oceans thus produces water
pressure of H2
vapour that is 18O-depleted (by about 1% relative). The relative proportion of 18O in a sample is
expressed in terms of its fractional deviation, δ18O, from a standard mean ocean water value (about
2 · 10−3). The δ18O value of sea sediments provides a measure of the global volume of water locked
up in (18O-depleted) ice sheets, since high ice volumes leave the oceans enriched in 18O.

18O is lower than that of H2

[9] Muller and MacDonald [3] proposed that variations in the accretion of extraterrestrial dust could
explain all the data, but the amount of extraterrestrial dust accreting on Earth’s atmosphere is less
than 1 µm per year, and it has been questioned whether this could drive cloud cover.

[49] The spectral power was calculated by interpolating the data to equally spaced points, removing
the average (but not the trend), using a boxcar window (i.e. all points equally weighted), padding
the end with zeroes (to give intermediate frequencies), and then taking the square of the Fourier
transform.

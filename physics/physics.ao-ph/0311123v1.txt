ABSTRACT

The stability of Semi-Impliit shemes for the Hydrostati Primitive Equations system

has been studied extensively over the past twenty years, sine this temporal sheme and

this system represented a standard for NWP. However, with the inrease of omputational

power, the relaxation of the hydrostati approximation through the use of nonhydrostati

fully elasti systems is now emerging for future NWP as an attrative, solution valid

at any sale.

In this ontext, several models employing the so-alled Euler Equations

together with a onstant-oe(cid:30)ients semi-impliit time disretisation have already been

developed, but no solid justi(cid:28)ation for the suitability of this algorithmi ombination has

been presented so far, espeially from the point of view of robustness.

The aim of this paper is to investigate the response of this system/sheme in terms

of stability in presene of expliitly treated residual terms, as it inevitably ours in

the reality of NWP. This sudy is restrited to the impat of thermal and bari residual

terms (metri residual terms linked to the orography are not onsidered here).

It is

shown that onversely to what ours with Hydrostati Primitive Equations, the hoie

of the prognosti variables used to solve the system in time is of primary importane

for the robustness with Euler Equations. For an optimal hoie of prognosti variables,

unonditionnally stable shemes an be obtained (with respet to the length of the time-

step), but only for a smaller range of referene states than in the ase of Hydrostati

Primitive Equations. This study also indiates that: (i) vertial oordinates based on

geometrial height and on mass behave similarly in terms of stability for the problems

examined here, and (ii) hybrid oordinates indue an intrinsi instability, the pratial

importane of whih is however not ompletely eluidated in the theoretial ontext of

this paper.

Introdution

In their most general de(cid:28)nition, semi-impliit (SI) shemes onsist in an arbitrary separa-

tion of the evolution terms of any dynamial system between some linear terms, treated

impliitly, and non-linear residuals (NL residuals hereafter), treated expliitly. In mete-

orology, depending on the nature of the impliitly-treated terms, three main types of SI

shemes an be distinguished. The oe(cid:30)ients of these linear terms may be: (i) onstant

both in time and horizontally; (ii) onstant in time only; and (iii) non-onstant.

The (cid:28)rst approah was initially introdued for meterologial appliations by Robert

et al., 1972, and has been extensively used in numerial weather predition (NWP) sine

the solution of the resulting impliit system requires only basi tehniques. However, due

to large NL residuals, the stability of these shemes is not formally guaranteed, espeially

for long time-steps.

The seond and third approahes require more sophistiated tehniques for solving the

resulting impliit system, but they allow a signi(cid:28)ant redution of the magnitude of the

expliitly treated residuals, and hene, a potentially better stability.

In the present paper, the terms "onstant-oe(cid:30)ients SI shemes" exlusively refer to

the above (cid:28)rst ategory of SI shemes, and only these shemes are onsidered in all the

following, unless expressly mentionned.

Historially, SI shemes have been (cid:28)rst applied in NWP for solving the hydrostati

primitive equations (HPE) system, and extensive stability studies have been arried out

with this system. Simmons et al., 1978 (hereafter SHB78) investigated the pratial sta-

bility of HPEs with the three-time-level (herafter referred to as 3-TL) leap-frog onstant-

oe(cid:30)ients SI sheme in the terrain-following pressure-based σ oordinate. To do so, they

examined the e(cid:27)et of the leading NL residual terms on the stability when the SI referene

3

temperature deviates from the atual temperature. They showed that, in the partiular

ase where the omplete model operator and the linearized SI operator have the same

eigenfuntions, the stability an be studied analytially. In the more general ase, when

this latter ondition is not ful(cid:28)lled, Coté et al., 1983 (hereafter CBS83) showed that the

stability an still be assessed, but at the prie of a "numerial analysis" whih an be

performed only in the spae-disretized ontext; the stability analysis then beomes an

eigenvalue problem in a generalized state-vetor spae where the whole spae- and time-

disretized model ats as a so-alled "ampli(cid:28)ation matrix". The salient result of SHB78

was that a warm isothermal hoie for the SI referene temperature pro(cid:28)le resulted in a

more stable sheme than when using limatologial pro(cid:28)les for the SI referene-state, a

rule whih has been widely followed in pratial NWP appliations. The two methods

proposed by SHB78 and CBS83 (analysis in simpli(cid:28)ed ases, and numerial analysis in

the general ase) have been adopted by most of subsequent studies on the SI sheme

stability. CBS83 showed that, for the (cid:28)nite-element vertial disretization of a 3-TL HPE

model in σ oordinate, the SI referene-state stati stability had to be larger than half

the atual one, in order to ahieve stability, whih explains and generalizes the previous

results by SHB78. Simmons and Temperton (1997, hereafter ST97) have extended the

study of SHB78 to extrapolating two-time-level (hereafter 2-TL) SI shemes, still in the

HPE system but for the more general hybrid-pressure terrain-following η oordinate (in

η oordinate, the surfae pressure in the SI referene-state also has to be onsidered for

the stability of the SI sheme).

However, with the inreasing resolutions allowed by faster omputers, nonhydrostati

NH models are now aessible to NWP, thus avoiding the limitations assoiated with the

hydrostati assumption. However, the aim for NWP models should be to ahieve the

relaxation of the hydrostati approximation while keeping the same degree of e(cid:30)ieny

4

as the former HPE SI semi-Lagrangian systems. This pleads in favor of attempting to

extend the SI tehnique to the new generation of nonhydrostati semi-Lagrangian models.

Among the possible NH systems, the fully elasti Euler Equations (EE) system is generally

advoated for several reasons, inluding the possibility to build a "universal" atmospheri

model whih dynamial kernel is valid for all sales used by the meteorologial ommunity.

Several models using the EE system with a onstant-oe(cid:30)ients SI sheme have been

reently developed (Tanguay et al., 1990; Laprise et al., 1995; Semazzi et al., 1995; Bub-

nová et al., 1995, hereafter BHBG95; Caya and Laprise, 1999), but the stability of suh

a ombination has not yet been studied in detail. Tanguay et al. (1990) examined the

stability of the tangent-linear version of their model around the SI referene state (i.e. in

the absene of non-linear terms). Not surprisingly, they found that the system is unondi-

tionally stable, sine this follows from a general property of any purely linear SI physial

system. However, the experiene aumulated with former HPE systems learly indiates

that some are must be taken when (expliitly treated) nonlinear terms are present. More-

over, there is no ob jetive reason to expet an intrinsially more robust behavior of the SI

EE system ompared to the SI HPE system. Espeially, when inreasing the resolution

to mesosales, terms assoiated with the orographi foring or with physial proesses

ould have an inreasingly stringent impat on the stability, due to their inreased on-

tribution in the total evolution. In BHBG95, we reported an unstable behavior for the

EE system with the SI time disretization, and this problem was solved in the Eulerian

ontext through the iteration of a part of the NL residual terms. However the unstable

behavior reappeared when the resolution was re(cid:28)ned or when the timestep was inreased,

as allowed by the implementation of a semi-Lagrangian sheme. This prompted us to

undertake this study. A general formalism for studying the stability of various time dis-

retizations (inluding the SI sheme) and equation systems (inluding the EE system)

5

has been presented in Bénard (2003), B03 herefater. This general method is applied here

to the ase of the 3-TL SI sheme for the EE system with (cid:29)at orography, in order to

show the essential role played by the hoie of prognosti variables in the robustness of

the system.

2 Framework of analyses

In this paper (exept in Appendix B), the EE are ast in the pure unstrethed terrain-

following oordinate σ whih an be lassially derived from the mass-based hydrostati-

pressure oordinate π (Laprise, 1992) through σ = (π/πs), where πs is the hydrostati

surfae pressure. The σ oordinate examined here is a partiular ase of the general

strethed hybrid-pressure terrain-following oordinate η of BHBG95. However, the use

of the σ oordinate is advantageous for the theoretial analysis sine it possesses a muh

simpler vertial metris. Starting from the general η formalism, the equations for the σ

oordinate an be obtained by setting the arbitrary A(η) and B(η) funtions in equation

(9) of BHBG95 as follow:

A(η) = 0

B(η) = η ≡ σ

(1)

In all the disussions of this paper, the (cid:29)ow will be assumed adiabati invisid and frition-

less in a non-rotating perfet-gas dry atmosphere with a Cartesian oordinate system. In

these onditions, the omplete set of Euler equations an be easily derived from BHBG95

equations (1)-(8) with the same standard notations (for non-standard notations see Ap-

pendix A). The system in σ oordinate writes:

We note q = ln(πs), p is the true pressure, and w is the vertial veloity.

The theoretial analysis of the stability of non-linear systems suh as (3)-(7) is not possible

in the most general onditions and requires some simpli(cid:28)ations in order to beomes

algebraially tratable. For the analyses presented here, we use the same method and

notations as in B03, whih is basially a generalisation of the method proposed by SHB78.

In symboli notations, the equations of the system to be solved an be written as:

∂X
∂t

= M(X )

where X is the state variable, and M is the full model operator ontaining only spatial

dependenies on X . For the de(cid:28)nition of the SI sheme, as usually done in NWP, a SI

referene-state X ∗

is hosen, and the system M is linearized around X ∗

, resulting in a

linear operator noted L∗

. The 3-TL SI time disretization writes:

X + − X −
2∆t

=

M(X 0) − L∗.X 0

+ L∗.

where the supersript (-, 0, +) indiates variables at time (t − ∆t), t, and (t + ∆t)

respetively, where ∆t is the lenth of the timestep. The stability of the model is then

onditioned by the struture of the NL residual (M − L∗).

For the purpose of analyses, the (cid:29)ow is assumed to onsist of small perturbations

around a steady basi-state X . Hene M(X ) = (∂X /∂t) = 0, and the full model evolution

M an be desribed by L, the linear-tangent operator of M around X .

The 3-TL SI time-disretized equation then beomes:

X + − X −

(cid:1)

(12)

whih represents the equation to be solved in the simpli(cid:28)ed framework examined here.

Note that X 6= X ∗

and hene L 6= L∗

thus giving rise to expliit ontributions in (12 )

The other simpli(cid:28)ations adopted for the present analyses (as well as in SHB78), on-

sist in assuming that both basi- and SI referene-states are resting, isothermal and

hydrostatially-balaned, with a uniform (plateau) orography.

As a onsequene, in hydrostati-pressure based oordinate, the X and X ∗

states

are simply haraterized by their uniform temperature and hydrostati surfae-pressure

(cid:28)elds, i.e. by the pairs of numbers (T , πs ) and (T ∗

, π∗

s ) respetively. Finally, the domain

is assumed two-dimensional (in a vertial plane) with x as horizontal oordinate.

The fat to examine the stability of the numerial system in this highly simpli(cid:28)ed ontext

of ourse leads to an overestimation of the stability ompared to what an be expeted for

more omplex (cid:29)ows with a fully non-linear model. However if a sheme is found unstable

here, it will have little hanes to be appliable in pratie.

Impat of the SI-referene pressure

In this setion, we examine the SI sheme for EE when the atual hydrostati surfae-

pressure πs deviates from its SI referene ounterpart π∗

s , everything else being equal for

the two states. Hene, in this setion the basi X and referene X ∗

states are haraterized

by (T ≡ T ∗

, πs) and (T ∗

, π∗

s ) respetively. The linearized equations are derived from

(3)-(7) or from Eq. (13)-(21) of BHBG95, with the following set of prognosti variables:

horizontal divergene D , temperature T , q = ln(πs), and the following two nonhydrostati

variables as in BHBG95:

where π∗(η) is the SI referene pressure pro(cid:28)le, and m∗(η) = (dπ∗/dη). In σ oordinate,

these variables beome:

systems. Moreover the fator (π∗/π)

writes (π∗

s /πs) in the present linearized ontext in σ oordinate. As a onsequene, the

new L system writes:

Sine this system has no dependeny on π∗

s , it is obvious that the SI referene system L∗

will have exatly the same form as L for this set of variables. In fat, it an be seen that

using the variables (q , P ), and the σ oordinate allows to ompletely eliminate the SI

referene surfae-pressure π∗

s from the model formulation, in opposition to what ours

10

when using πs and/or

ˆP as prognosti variables and/or the general hybrid η oordinate.

For the new variable P , there is no NL residual terms, and hene no potential soure of

instability due to the disrepany between πs and π∗

s for the examined problem. As a

diret onsequene, no stability analysis is neessary here to onlude that the variable P

is better suited to the design of a SI sheme than

ˆP .

Similar algebrai derivations show that for the partiular problem examined here, the

various possible hoies for the prognosti pressure variables fall into two lasses:

(i) variables leading to potentially unstable SI: p, p/p0 , p − π , p/π∗

,

ˆP

(ii) variables leading to stable SI: ln(p), ln(p/p0), p/π , ln(p/π), P

where p0 is an arbitrary onstant.

It is worth emphasizing that the above statement

holds for height-based oordinates as well as for the mass-based oordinate that was used

here (with of ourse the restrition due to the fat that the variables involving π are

not natural with height-based oordinates). These properties follow immediately from

the derivation of the orresponding linear system in the same ontext, for height-based

oordinates. From now on, the new variable P will be used instead of the original variable

ˆP used in BHBG95.

Impat of the SI referene temperature

In this setion, we examine the stability of the SI sheme for EE with the prognosti

variables (D ,

ˆd, T , P , q), when the basi uniform temperature T deviates from the

SI referene state temperature T ∗

, everything else being equal for the two states. The

variable

ˆd is still given by (16). As a onsequene, the 3-dimensional divergene D3 (see

Eq. (20) of BHBG95) writes for the L system:

The L∗

operator is de(cid:28)ned in a similar way, simply replaing T by T ∗

in the RHS of the

above system.

The method for the stability analysis exatly follows the one proposed in B03, and the

reader is invited to refer to this paper for more details on the notations and the algebrai

developments. The above system is (cid:28)rst shown to ful(cid:28)l the four onditions [C1℄(cid:21)[C4℄

required for making possible the spae-ontinuous analyses with the proposed method.

The number of prognosti variable is P = 4 in the sense of B03, and the spae-ontinuous

state-vetor is X = (X1, . . . , X4) = (D, ˆd, T, P). The linear operator in [C1℄ involves

l1 = ˜∂ applied to (30) and l4 = ( ˜∂ + I) applied to (33) as in setion 7.1 of B03. The

ondition [C'2℄ requires T > 0, and the normal modes of the system are then:

Xj(x, σ) =

Xj exp(ikx) σ(iν−1/2) ,

for j ∈ (1, . . . , 4)

(35)

where (k, ν) ∈ IR (note that ν is a non-dimensional vertial wavenumber). In this parti-

b

ular ase, the four omponents (f1, . . . , f4) of the shape funtion f introdued in B03 are

idential. The vetor funtion f represents the geometry of any normal mode of the time

and spae-ontinuous system. The veri(cid:28)ation of [C3℄, [C4℄ proeeds easily, as in B03; for

[C3℄, we have:

This eighth-degree omplex polynomial equation in λ an be solved numerially: for any

pair (k , ν ), the modulus of the eight roots λ give the growth rate of the eight orrespond-

ing eigenmodes (four physial modes and four omputational modes, due to the 3-TL

disretization). If one of the roots has a modulus larger than one, then the orresponding

mode is unstable. The stability of the sheme for the struture funtion f orrespond-

ing to a pair (k , ν ) is then given by the maximum modulus of the eigth orresponding

eigenvalues:

Γ = Max (|λi|) ,

i ∈ (1, . . . , 8)

(62)

The riterion for unonditional stability of the sheme with respet to the time-step an

be found by requiring stability at the large time-steps limit in the above equation. The

terms ontaining Λ− are then vanishing and the equation for the growth rate beomes:

The four modes represented by (Λ+)2 = 0 are always neutral. Conversely, in the other

set of roots the short vertial modes are always unstable.

In e(cid:27)et, for these roots,

substituting the time disretization response fators by their value leads to:

(1 + α)(λ2 + 1)2 − 2α2λ(λ − 1)2 [iν + (1/2 − Cp/Cv)] = 0

For short modes, ν >> 1, hene the modulus of the four roots beomes lose to:

|λ|(1,2,3,4) ≈

(65)

and obviously this leads to large instabilities. As a onsequene, exept in the degenerated

ase α = 0, the sheme annot be unonditionally stable in ∆t, beause for large time-

steps, short enough vertial modes are unstable.

However, drawing on the results of the previous setion, the sensitivity of the stability to

the hoie of the prognosti variables is suspeted, and the relevane of the original hoie

15

that the soure of the problem lies in the small disrepany between

The four modes involved by the (cid:28)rst fator are always neutral. Basi algebrai manipula-

tions show that the modes involved in the seond fator are stable for −1 ≤ α ≤ 1, while

the last fator requires −1/2 ≤ α for stability. Finally, onsidering the de(cid:28)nition of α,

the sheme is unonditionally stable in ∆t when the following ondition is ful(cid:28)lled:

T ∗
2

≤ T ≤ 2T ∗

(76)

The above type of stability analyses an be performed in the same way for any other

vertial-veloity related prognosti variable. From the set {w , (∂w/∂η),

ˆd, d}, only the

last variable is then found to allow a non-vanishing range of unonditional stability in

mass-based oordinates. But onversely to what ourred in the previous setion, this

result is now dependent on the type of vertial oordinate used: for height-based oordi-

nates, the same kind of analysis (see Appendix B) shows that the two most natural hoies

{w , ∂w/∂z} lead to the same unonditional stability riterion than one obtained here for

d variable in mass-based oordinate. Hene, from the point of view of the asymptoti

stability at long time-steps, height-based and mass-based oordinates behave identially

provided "optimal" variables are hosen. The fat that d in mass-based oordinates and

(∂w/∂z) in height-based oordinates behave similarly an be understood intuitively sine

these two variables are in fat two expressions of a same onept in the present simpli(cid:28)ed

ontext (i.e. they both represent the true vertial divergene here). The reason why w

is stable in height-based oordinates but unstable in mass-based oordinates is more sub-

tle: as suggested by the above analyses, the robustness of the SI sheme appears to be

highly orrelated to the existene of NL residuals in the elasti term D3 ; when w is used

as a prognosti variable in height-based oordinates, D3 an be readily obtained from

17

D + (∂w/∂z), and has no NL residual, thus leading to a stable sheme in the examined

ontext. With mass-based oordinates however, if w is hosen as a prognosti variable, D3

must be evaluated through D −(gp/RT )(∂w/∂π) and the existene of a NL residual when

T 6= T ∗

may lead to instabilities. The fat that the vertial divergene d is ompletely

imposed as a prognosti variable if a robust SI sheme is desired for the EE system with

(cid:29)at-terrain is thus a spei(cid:28)ity of mass-based oordinates.

Another important result from the above analysis is that, even with an optimal hoie

of the prognosti variables, the stability range is dramatially redued for EE system

ompared to the HPE system, whatever vertial oordinate is used. For HPEs (see e.g.

SHB78), the riterion (76) would write:

0 ≤ T ≤ 2T ∗

(77)

Chosing a very warm T ∗

garantees stability in HPEs while this is no longer the ase for

EEs. Moreover, if the atual temperature were to vary by more than a fator 4 in the

atmosphere, the SI tehnique examined here ould not o(cid:27)er any stable sheme for the EE

system. The SI EE system is thus less stable by nature than the SI HPE system, and

its appliability for NWP is only made possible thanks to the moderate variability of the

thermal (cid:28)eld in the terrestrial atmosphere.

5 Pratial Impliations

For a given mode, the root of maximum modulus in (64) and (75) gives the asymptoti

growth rate for large timesteps for the two variables

ˆd and d examined above. For the

variable

ˆd, this asymptoti growth rate is funtion of α and ν , hene the instability is

diretly linked to the vertial resolution of the model; for the variable d the asymptoti

growth rate is funtion of α only. Figure 1 shows the asymptoti growth rate for a

18

vertial spaing of 100 m (i.e. a minimum vertial wavelength of 200 m), for

ˆd and d, in

the onditions of the above analyses. Assuming a typial value ±0.25 for α in realisti

onditions, the range of growth rate for the variable

ˆd is learly inompatible with a stable

integration of the SI sheme with very long time-steps. In pratial appliations however,

the time-step is bounded, and the growth, if present, may not endanger signi(cid:28)antly the

stability of the sheme. However, diret numerial solution of (51) shows that in fat

any mode (k , ν ) is unstable for any timestep, when α 6= 0. For instane, in Fig. 1 are

also plotted the numerial growth rates obtained for a mode whih geometry is lose to

the shortest mode for a typial mesosale future NWP limited-area target on(cid:28)guration

with 3-TL semi-Lagrangian sheme (∆x = 2000 m, ∆z = 100 m, and ∆t = 20 s): the

system with

ˆd variable is signi(cid:28)antly unstable as soon as α 6= 0, even for this modest

timestep. The

ˆd variable is learly demonstrated as not suitable for use in a SI EE sheme

in mass-based oordinates. This was one of the reasons why an iterative proedure was

required and applied in the NH model desribed in BHBG95.

An additional remark onerning the stability for (cid:28)nite timesteps is that surprisingly,

when an optimal variable is hosen in height-based oordinates, the SI sheme whih is

stable for long timesteps beomes slightly unstable for (cid:28)nite timesteps as soon as α 6= 0,

as seen in Appendix B. A similar behaviour was found in B03 for the one dimensional

aousti system with long time-steps in height-based oordinates. This unstable behaviour

an be interpreted as originating from the fat that in height-based oordinates, the time-

ontinuous normal modes of the L system are not normal modes of L∗

, as pointed out in

Appendix B. As a onsequene, the time-ontinuous evolution of any normal mode of L by

the L∗

system ontains a growing omponent (i.e. a omplex non-real frequeny) as soon

as α 6= 0. The SI sheme is then not able to ensure a stable evolution for some of these

omponents. This type of instability does not our for mass-based oordinates, as seen

19

in Fig. 1. From the theoretial point of view, this behaviour is in defavour of height-based

oordinates, but it should be noted that the resulting instabilities are generally moderate

(not shown) and ould be ontrolled by the use of slightly damping algorithms (e.g. SI

deentering as in Laprise, 1995) or by the di(cid:27)usive proesses ating in a omplete model.

The stability of the SI sheme an be studied for non-isothermal linear atmospheri

(cid:29)ows, using the "numerial analysis" method proposed by CBS83: The linearized equa-

tions have (cid:28)rst to be vertially disretized. For a given eigenmode of the horizontal ∇2

operator, the atual and referene model operators an then be expressed as two matries

operating on the perturbation state-vetor X. The equation of model evolution

L and L∗

(12) then writes:

Yt+∆t = A.Yt

where the generalized state vetor Yt

is de(cid:28)ned by (Xt, Xt−∆t), and the ampli(cid:28)ation

matrix A is given by:

2∆t (IX − ∆tL∗)−1.

L − L∗

(IX − ∆tL∗)−1. (IX + ∆tL∗)

IX

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

0X

A = 



where IX and 0X are the identity and null operators in the state-vetor spae respetively.

Noting Γ the largest modulus of A eigenvalues, the sheme is stable if Γ ≤ 1 and unstable

if Γ > 1. The eigenvetor assoiated with Γ gives the vertial struture and polarisation

(78)

(79)






of the most unstable mode.

Our implementation of this "numerial analysis" method has been validated by om-

parison with the results of the above analyses: the agreement was found very good (not

shown). Here, the "numerial analysis" method is applied to quantify the impat of the

hange from

ˆd to d in more realisti situations than the one assumed in the above anal-

yses. Following SHB78, a realisti atual temperature pro(cid:28)le is hosen: it onsists in a

tropospheri pro(cid:28)le with a quasi-uniform dry stati stability and an isothermal strato-

20

sphere above 200 hPa, as depited in Fig. 2 (the surfae temperature is set to 285 K).

The vertial disretization of L and L∗

models follows BHBG95. The numerial analysis

is performed for the same typial future NWP target values for (∆x, ∆t) as in Fig. 1.

The stability is examined for values of T ∗

varying in the interval [200 K, 320 K℄.

Figure 2 shows the growth rates obtained for 10, 20 and 30 regularly-spaed σ levels,

for the

ˆd and d variables. The theoretial disadvantage of

ˆd is on(cid:28)rmed: for high ver-

tial resolutions, the sheme is unstable for almost every value of T ∗, with growth rates

unompatible with a pratial use. The logarithm of the growth rate is found roughly pro-

portional to the horizontal wavenumber k , on(cid:28)rming that troubles linked to the presene

of NL terms beome more and more stringent when the horizontal resolution is inreased.

Moreover, reduing the timestep is found to be of no help for a given foreast range be-

ause the logarithm of the growth rate is always roughly proportional to the time-step.

Conversely, the use of variable d results in a stable sheme provided T ∗

is hosen warm

enough in the examined interval (and up to 440 K here, onsistenly with analyses).

Taking d as prognosti variable, the impat of the hoie of the nonhydrostati pressure

variable (

ˆP vs. P ) an be examined numerially, still in the same ontext. It has been

shown in setion 3 why the system ould be potentially unstable when πs deviates from

s . To on(cid:28)rm and illustrate this statement, two values of π∗
π∗

s are hosen (813.25 hPa, and

1213.25 hPa), while πs is assumed to be 1013.25 hPa, still for the same thermal pro(cid:28)le

and experimental ontext as above, and for 30 regularly-spaed σ -levels. The solid lines in

Figure 3 show the growth rates obtained for the variable

ˆP (as explained in setion 3, the

growth rate has no dependeny on π∗

s when the variable P is used, hene the orresponding

growth rate for the variable P an be seen in Fig. 2, regardless of the value of π∗

s ). The

use of the

ˆP variable indues a global derease in stability espeially for π∗

s =1213.25 hPa

and low values of T ∗

. For high values of T ∗

, an instability subsists for both values of π∗
s ,

21

ˆP for NWP

ˆP instead

but it is weak (growth rates around 1.015), and the pratial risk of using

is hene di(cid:30)ult to assess from this simpli(cid:28)ed theory and should be evaluated in a more

realisti ontext. However, sine there is no other potential advantage of using

of P , this question is probably not of primary interest.

Finally, examination of the above algebra shows that the hybrid η oordinate an

also be responsible for instabilities when πs deviates from π∗

s , as it may e.g. be the ase

when the terrain is uniformly elevated. This is linked to the fat that in η oordinate, all

vertial operators (G , S , N ,

˜∂ ) deviate from their SI-referene ounterpart when πs 6= π∗
s ,

the resulting NL residuals potentially leading to instability. The disrepany between the

vertial metris of L and L∗

models makes impossible the analysis for a general hoie of

A and B funtions; hene, we use the "numerial analysis" method proposed by CBS83

to examine the impat of using a hybrid oordinate instead of a pure terrain-following

oordinate when πs 6= π∗
s .

The dashed lines in Figure 3 show the growth rates obtained for the variable P

when a regularly (cid:29)attening unstrethed η oordinate, de(cid:28)ned by: π(η) = −ρη ln(η)p00 +

η [1 + ρ ln(η)] πs (with p00=1013.25 hPa, and ρ=0.25) is used with the same realisti ther-

mal pro(cid:28)le and disrepanies of ±200 hPa between πs and π∗

s as above. For high values of

T ∗

, the loss of stability is of similar magnitude as the one resulting from the hoie of

ˆP

as prognosti variable. It is noteworthy that the instability linked to the use of the hybrid

oordinate in EE annot be eliminated by hoosing high values for T ∗

, as it was the ase

for HPE system (Simmons and Temperton, 1997), hene there is indiation that hybrid

η oordinate possesses a slight theoretial disadvantage from this point of view, but this

may be not redhibitory in pratie. In other respets, the η oordinate has been laimed

to bring some advantages ompared to σ oordinates, espeially for the auray of the

pressure-gradient fore omputation, and for the assimilation of high-level data (Simmons

22

and Burridge, 1981). Hene, aording to the warning signal obtained here, the question

of the relevane of the hybrid oordinate should legitimately have to be onsidered when

implementing a real-ase appliation in EE system with π -type oordinate, but annot be

answered with a reasonable ertainty at this stage.

6 Comments

The intrinsi sensivity of SI shemes stability to the hoie of prognosti variables whih

has been demonstrated in this paper, is totally independent of the spae disretization,

sine the analyses have been performed in the spae-ontinuous ontext. As a onse-

quene, any numerial model built with an intrinsially unstable variable will exhibit an

unstable behaviour, regardless of the spae-disretization and staggering hoies that may

be done. However, it has been shown that an intrisinally stable variable for height-based

oordinates an beome intrinsially unstable for mass-based oordinates beause of the

(cid:29)ow-dependent vertial metris of this type of oordinates. Hene, it appears that for

designing a SI numerial model in EE system, the hoie of the prognosti variables an-

not be made independently of the hoie of the vertial oordinate, even at the level of

spae-ontinuous equations.

One ould wonder if this dependeny is spei(cid:28) to the EE system or if it was already

present in HPE systems, whih are ast in π -type oordinates. First it should be noted that

HPE system does not o(cid:27)er a large latitude for the hoie of prognosti variables: for the

problems examined here, the prognosti variable for the vertially integrated ontinuity

equation is the only relevant one: it an be set to be πs or q = ln(πs). The above numerial

method applied to the HPE system demonstrates the absene of sensitivity to the hoie

of these prognosti variables (not shown). For instane, the instabilities reported by

23

Simmons and Temperton (1997), whih are the onsequene of using a hybrid oordinate,

develop almost identially for πs and q = ln(πs) variables. The sensitivity of the stability

to the hoie of the set of prognosti variables disussed here is thus a spei(cid:28)ity of fully

elasti nonhydrostati systems (anelasti systems have not been examined).

7 Conlusion

The stability of onstant-oe(cid:30)ients SI shemes for the system of Euler Equations has

been examined from an theoretial point of view, in deliberately simpli(cid:28)ed ontexts to

allow tratable analyses. The salient result of the study is that the stability an be

dramatially a(cid:27)eted by hanges in the set of prognosti variables whih are used to

design the SI sheme, and this, independently of any spae disretization. It appears that

the hoie of the two "nonhydrostati" variables has to be arefully heked if an optimal

stability is desired, espeially for mass-based oordinates. Non-optimal hoies generally

result in growth rates inompatible with a pratial NWP use, as experiened in BHBG95.

This sensitivity of the SI sheme stability to the hoie of prognosti variables was not

present in the HPE system.

If the SI referene surfae-pressure deviates from its atual ounterpart for mass-based

oordinates, hybrid oordinates are found more unstable than the orresponding pure

terrain-following oordinates, as reported previously for HPE system, but the pratial

onsequenes of this slight instability need to be evaluated in more realisti ontexts.

The analyses and results reported in this paper apply to onstant-oe(cid:30)ients SI

shemes, however, sine only thermal and bari NL residuals are involved, the results

extend identially to those SI shemes belonging to the lass (ii) of the introdution for

whih the referene temperature and pressure are horizontally homogeneous (e.g. Thomas

24

et al., 1998; Qian et al, 1998).

The pratial interest of this theoretial study ould be onsidered as quite limited,

sine only a very small part of the NL terms due to the disrepany between the atual

state X and the SI referene state X ∗

has been onsidered. In this respet, the develop-

ments presented here should rather be viewed as an endeavour to stress that a speial are

must be exerted in the hoie of prognosti variables for building a onstant-oe(cid:30)ients

SI EE system, whatever type of oordinate is used.

In a more general way, there is another pratial interest to this study: as a predi-

tive tool, it an serve for the validation of pratial numerial appliations:

in a simi-

lar way that analytially predited stationnary orographi (cid:29)ows are ommonly used for

validating the relevane of spae-disretisation shemes, the analytially predited sta-

bility an be used for a areful validation of time-disretisation shemes. Moreover, if a

"numerial-analysis" tool is built, a omplete set of ross-validations beomes possible be-

tween analyses preditions, numerial-analyses diagnostis, and observed numerial-model

behaviour. This may signi(cid:28)antly help to improve the detetion of anomalous behaviour

in a numerial model, or the predition of the behaviour of alternative time disretizations

(o(cid:27)-entered SI sheme, iterative treatments, et...).

Nevertheless, as stated above, this study unavoidably leads to an overestimation of

the stability in omparison to the likely stability for real-ase onditions beause it retains

only a very small part of all NL terms arising from the disrepany (M − L∗). Among the

most important soures of NL residuals, the spatial variability of the orography has been

negleted so far. Hene, there is no proof that the optimal set found here (e.g. q , P , d,

and σ oordinate) is still optimal, or even reasonnably stable, when a steep orography is

introdued. Further examination of this topi would onstitute an interesting extension

for the present study.

Appendix B : Stability analysis of the EE in regular Gal-

Chen oordinate

The formalism for the derivation of the onstant-oe(cid:30)ients SI sheme analysed here

basially follows Caya and Laprise (1999). Notations are standard ones and taken idential

to this paper unless spei(cid:28)ed. The unstrethed Gal-Chen oordinate is de(cid:28)ned by:

where HD is the height of the domain, and h0 is the height of the terrain. In the absene

of orography (h0 ≡ 0) we thus have:

ζ =

z − h0
HD − h0

HD

ζ = z

The general framework is the same as in the above analyses, as depited in setion 2,

and the thermal disrepany between X and X ∗

states is still noted α = (T − T ∗)/T ∗

.

However, unlike for mass-based oordinates, the pressure variable q = ln(p/p00) (not

to be onfused with q = ln(πs) for mass-oordinates systems in the main part of the

paper) needs to be de(cid:28)ned in the whole spae for both X and X ∗

states. The hydrostati

equilibrium and stationnarity of these states implies:

entred impliit way while the right part is treated expliitly. For the analysis, a small

pertubation (

T ,

q) around the atual state (T , q) must be introdued and the omplete

system must be linearized around (T , q). Equating the total variables T and q yields:

The terms whih are non-linear in (u, w ,

e

T ,

q) are then dropped in the above system

(T ′

and q′

annot be onsidered as small however). The atual state X being a resting
e

e

state, time derivatives are replaed by (∂/∂t). However, a speial are must be taken to

express (dq′/dt) in term of (d

q/dt), beause the vertial transport of (q − q∗) is a linear

term whih must be retained. If an Eulerian sheme for the vertial advetion is used,

e

then:

where the advetion term is treated expliitly. For a semi-Lagrangian vertial transport

sheme, the assumptions of perfet solution for the displaement equation, and of perfet

interpolators, onsistent with the spae-ontinuous ontext, lead after some manipulation

based on Taylor series expansions in spae, to the same result than for the Eulerian

advetion sheme as written in (89).

The linearization of the above system around the X state leads, after some algebrai

manipulation to a form ompatible with the analysis proposed in B03. The L system

then writes:

The SI referene system L∗

is shown to be formally idential, but with T replaed by T ∗

.

We have P = 4 and the normal modes of the time-ontinuous system are given by:

Xj(x, z) =

Xj exp(ikx) exp(nz) j ∈ (1, . . . , 4)

(94)

where n = (iν + 1/2)/H and H = RT /g . It should be noted that the time-ontinuous

b

normal modes of the L∗

system have a di(cid:27)erent vertial struture exp(n∗z) with n∗ =

(iν + 1/2)g/(RT ∗). This disrepany between the height-sales for the vertial growth of

time-ontinuous normal modes has some important onsequenes, as disussed

L and L∗

in setion 5.

The analysis then proeeds as for mass-based oordinates by de(cid:28)ning a numerial

growth rate λ. For a given geometry (k, ν), the stability equation (cid:28)nally writes:

k2(Λ+)

Λ + nn(Λ+)

Λ + n

(Λ+ − λ)

The asymptoti growth rate is then given by the same equation (75) as for mass-

based oordinates, hene the onditions for unonditional stability are the same as well.

However, a ma jor di(cid:27)erene between Eqs. (95) and (74) is the presene of the last omplex

term in the braket of (95). The solution of this equation for (cid:28)nite time-steps shows that

this term, being omplex, is responsible of an instability when α 6= 0. The instability is

generally small, but is found to beome quite signi(cid:28)ant when kH ≈ ν ≈ 1, but, as stated

above, it always disappears for long time-steps.

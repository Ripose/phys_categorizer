Abstract

Velocity measurements of wind blowing near the North Sea border of North-
ern Germany and velocity measurements under local isotropic conditions of a
turbulent wake behind a cylinder are compared. It is shown that wind gusts –
measured by means of velocity increments – do show similar statistics to the
laboratory data, if they are conditioned on an averaged wind speed value.
Clear diﬀerences between the laboratory data and the atmospheric wind veloc-
ity measurement are found for the waiting time statistics between successive
gusts above a certain threshold of interest.

1 Introduction

The occurances of gusts represent a great problem aﬀecting a wide ﬁeld of technical
applications as for instance the construction of Wind Energy Converters [4] as well
as the construction of high buildings in general [5]. But also regarding the landing-
and take-oﬀ-operations at airports the importance of the statistics of gusts becomes
evident [6]. Nevertheless gusts are not uniquely deﬁned. In [2] or [3] gusts are taken
as an additional structure besides the permanent, ﬂuctuating turbulence u(t) around
the mean wind ¯u(t) of the wind velocity ﬁeld. More often wind gusts are charac-
terized by extrem velocity diﬀerences during short time intervals ranging typically
between some seconds up to a minute. But these characterisations are still vague.
In order to examine wind gusts in a statistical way we use a data set of a turbulent
wind velocity ﬁeld recorded near the coastline of the Northsea at the FH Ostries-
land in Emden (Germany). The velocity was measured by means of an ultrasonic
anemometer at 20 m height. The sampling frequency was 4 Hz. The measuring
period took about one year (1997-1998). After careful investigation of the quality
of the data we examine a representive 275-hour-excerpt of october 1997 and focus
on the velocity component in direction of the mean wind.
Our main interest is to explore how atmospheric turbulence is related to the well
known local isotropic and stationary laboratory one. Therefore we use a simple
measure for gusts and compare both velocity ﬁelds by means of their probabilistic
features. The laboratory data we use here was recorded in a wind tunnel behind
a cylinder with a Reynoldsnumber of Re
30000 (see [1]). In a second step we
examine the waiting time distributions of successive wind gusts to resolve also their
time structure.

2 Probabilistic description of wind gusts

The wind ﬁeld is known to exhibit a high degree of turbulence with Reynoldsnumbers
Re of about 107. The wind velocity U(t) is commonly (see [2]) expressed as the sum

2 PROBABILISTIC DESCRIPTION OF WIND GUSTS

of the mean velocity ¯u(t) and ﬂuctuations u(t) around it. For the mean velocity ¯u(t)
a ten minute average is used:

U = ¯u + u .

Here we concentrate on the velocity components in the mean velocity direction.
The greater the ﬂuctuation values u the more turbulent the wind ﬁeld becomes.
In windenergy research this is often expressed by the turbulence degree ti which is
deﬁned as the the standard deviation σ in relation to the mean velocity ¯u:

Nevertheless the value of ti does not contain any dynamical or time-resolved infor-
mation about the ﬂuctuation ﬁeld itself.

To achieve a deeper understanding of wind gusts – as a result of the ﬂuctuating wind
ﬁeld – we investigate in how far wind gusts are related to the well known features
of small scale turbulence. To this end we will perform an analogous analysis for
our wind data and data from a turbulent wake ﬂow behind a cylinder in a wind
tunnel. As a natural and simple measure of wind gusts we use the statistics of
velocity increments δuτ of the ﬂuctuations:

δuτ

The increments directly measure the velocity diﬀerence after a characteristic time τ
(illustrated in Fig.1). So a high increment exceeding a certain threshold S (δuτ > S)
can be deﬁned as a gust.
For a statistical analysis we are interested in how frequent a certain increment value
occurs and wether this frequency depends on τ . Therefore we calculate the prob-
ability density functions (pdfs) P (δuτ ) of the increments. In Fig. 2 the pdfs for 5
diﬀerent values of τ are shown. These distributions are all characterized by marked
fat tails and a peak around the mean value. Such pdfs are called intermittent and

suitable distribution for continous random processes.

The pdfs are shifted against each other for a clearer presentation and the respective
ﬁtfunctions (solid lines) according to eq. (5) are underlyed.

A normal distribution is uniquely deﬁned by its mean value µ and its standard
deviation σ. Thus every distribution can be compared to a normal distribution in a
quantitative way. In Fig. 3 we compare one of the measured pdfs (τ = 4 s) with a
Gaussian distribution with the same σ. In this presentation the diﬀerent behaviour
of the tails of both distributions becomes evident. Note that the high increments
of the wind pdfs – located in the tails – correspond to strong gusts. For instance
the value of δuτ = 7
σ corresponds to a velocity ascending of 5.6 m/s during 4 s).
As shown in Fig. 3 the measured probability of our wind data is about 106 times
higher than for a Gaussian distribution with the same standard deviation! This case
is represented by the arrow in Fig. 3. The value 106 – for instance – means that a
certain gust which is observed about ﬁve times a day should be observed just once
in 500 years if the distribution were a Gaussian instead of the observed intermittent
one.
But intermittent distributions seem to appear quite often in natural or economical
systems like in earthquake-([8]), foreign exchange market- ([9]) or even in some
traﬃc-statistics ([10]).

ized with σ = 0.8 m/s.

What kind of statistics does one get in the case of local isotropic and stationary
laboratory experiments? The typical probability density functions in laboratory
turbulence – as shown in Fig. 4 – change from intermittent ones for small values of
τ to rather Gaussian shaped distributions with increasing τ . When τ

shape, even for τ -values higher than T (as shown in Fig. 2) is not observed.

for diﬀerent values of τ . From the top to the bottom τ takes the values: 0.005 T ,
0.02 T , 0.17 T , 0.67 T and 1.35 T . In b) the conditioned pdfs are presented, here τ
is 0.008 T , 0.03 T , 0.2 T , 0.95 T and 1.9 T . The mean wind interval on which the
increments are conditioned is [4.5 ; 5.6] m/s. In both cases the solid lines are the
corresponding ﬁt-functions according to eq. (5). The distributions and their ﬁts are
shifted against each other for a clearer presentation.

As already mentioned a fundamental diﬀerence between atmospheric and laboratory
turbulence is that the latter is stationary. In laboratory experiments one usually
deals with a ﬁxed value and direction of the mean wind speed ¯u what obviously never
is the case for atmospheric wind ﬁelds. Therefore in a second step we calculate the
pdfs of the atmospheric increments only for certain mean velocity intervals. That
means that only those increments are taken into account with ¯u ranging in a narrow
velocity interval with a width of typically 1 m/s. These conditioned pdfs P (δuτ
¯u)
show a similar qualitative change of shape like those of the laboratory experiment1
which is illustrated in Fig. 4 b).
To quantify this similarity we use a well established ﬁt by an empirical explicite
function for the pdf. This formula was derived in [7] on the basis of Kolmogorov’s

On the other hand the more λ2
τ increases the more intermittent the distributions
become. In this way the parameter λ2
τ may serve to compare the pdfs with each
other in a more quantitative way. In Fig. 5 the evolution of the formparameter as
a function of the increment distance τ is shown.
Other laboratory measurements (see [7]) of λ2
τ have investigated that it saturates
approximately at 0.2. As shown in Fig. 5 the formparameter of the conditioned
wind increments as well as of the conditioned laboratory ones is approximately 0.2
values. Furthermore it tends to zero with increasing τ . None of these
for small τ
two features is observed in the case of the unconditioned increments, λ2
τ is rather
independent from τ with a value of about 0.7.
Thus we have shown that the anomalous statistics of wind ﬂuctuations on discrete
time intervals – which are obviously related to wind gusts – can be reduced to the
well known intermittent (anomalous) statistics of local isotropic turbulence. Thus
on the basis of our stochastic analysis we claim that wind gusts are no independent
structures but are a part of small scale turbulence.

3 Waiting time distribution

So far we have shown how the amospheric turbulence is related to the laboratory one
in a statistical way. This probabalistic ansatz describes the frequency with which
certain gusts occur but it is not clear how they are distributed in time. In this sense
we now examine the inter-event-times between successive wind gusts.
The marked fat tail behaviour of the unconditioned pdfs – as illustrated in Fig. 2
a) – points at an interessting eﬀect. In [11] the equivalence between the divergence
of the moments < xq > and the hyperbolic (intermittent) form of pdfs which leads
to a power law behaviour of the probability distribution is emphasized:

p(x

S)

≥

∝

S−q

, S >> 1 .

A famous example of such a natural power law behaviour is the Gutenberg-Richter-
law [13] that describes the frequency N of earthquakes with a magnitude being
greater than a certain threshold M (magnitude):

log(N(E)) = a

bM

N(E)

⇔

∝

E−b

.

N(E) describes the number of occurances of those earthquakes with an energy out-
put higher than a threshold E0. The magnitude M is proportional to the logarithm
of E. The same result is found for the energy ﬂux distribution of a wind ﬁeld [8].
But also the waiting time distribution of fore- and after shocks obey a power-law,
what is known as the Omori-law [12].

3 WAITING TIME DISTRIBUTION

In this sense we now examine the waiting time distribution of wind gusts. Therefore
we refer to the idealized gust represented in Fig. 1 choosing diﬀerent thresholds A
and diﬀerent increment distances τ (see eq. 3). Always when the condition δuτ > A
is fulﬁlled a gust event is registered. To avoid counting one event several times we
use the condition that the distance between two successive events ∆T is at least τ .
Due to the cumulation of occurances for small time distances we choose a logarith-
mic time.
The distributions for A = 4.0 m/s and τ = 0.3 T (about ten seconds) and for
A = 1.5 m/s and τ = 2.0 T are shown in Fig. 6 a) respectively 6 b). It can easily
be seen that the exponential ﬁt in Fig. 6 corresponds to a power law concerning the
waiting times ∆T . Only the exponent seems to depend on A and τ .

4 SUMMARY

4 Summary

10

On the basis of well deﬁned velocity increments an analogous analysis of measured
wind data and measured data from a turbulent wake was performed. The statis-
tics of velocity increments, as a related statistic to the occurance frequency of wind
gusts, showed that they are highly intermittent. These anomalous (not Gaussian dis-
tributed) statistics explain an increased high probability of ﬁnding strong gusts and
could be set in analogy with turbulence measurements of idealized, local isotropic
laboratory ﬂows if a proper condition on a mean wind speed was done. So far the
statistics of wind gusts can be interpreted as a superposition of idealized packets of
turbulence at diﬀerent Reynoldsnumbers.
As a further statistical feature of wind gusts we have investigated the waiting times
between successive gusts exceeding a certain strength. Here we ﬁnd power-law-
statistics (fractal statistics) – similar to earthquake statistics – that can not be
reproduced in laboratory measurements.

Abstract

The Eady problem of baroclinic instability as applicable to quasi-
geostrophic oceanic ﬂows with zero internal PV gradients is revisited
by introducing a mild slope and Ekman pumping on the lower bound-
ary. The solution behaviour is determined by the isopycnal slope
relative to either the bottom slope or the ratio of Ekman depth to
horizontal wavenumber. Attention is paid to the physical interpreta-
tion of the growing, decaying and stable disturbances, with emphasis
on the intimate connection between the quasigeostrophic edge waves
and Eady waves, and the role of the isopycnal slope for the stability
properties as opposed to the bottom density gradient. The distur-
bance structure is found to be strongly inﬂuenced by the boundary
conditions.

For a sloping bottom boundary, the growth rate is enhanced for
the most unstable waves if the isopycnals tilt in the same direction as

1

the bottom, but in general non-standard boundary conditions tend to
retard the growth of disturbances. In particular, the existence of the
long- and short-wave cutoﬀs is found to be very sensitive to boundary
conditions, both for the sloping topography and the Ekman pumping.
It is suggested that any cutoﬀs for the growth rate in an Eady-like
problem actually result from the chosen boundary conditions. How-
ever, for a certain range of parameters, the maximum growth rate is
comparable to that found in the original Eady problem, which may ex-
plain the fair success enjoyed by recent eddy parameterizations basing
their timescale on the Eady growth rate.

man pumping, eddy parameterizations

1 Introduction

The importance of oceanic transports induced by mesoscale eddies has been
demonstrated in the previous decade for passive tracers (Danabasoglu et al.,
1994) as well as, tentatively, for ecological, reactive tracers (Oschlies and Gar¸con,
1998). The formation of these mid-ocean eddy transports is frequently de-
scribed with the baroclinic, quasigeostrophic stability problem of Eady (1949)
as a prototype.

Less attention has been devoted to eddy transports in the coastal areas.
As opposed to the original problem formulated by Eady with only horizon-
tal boundaries, coastal areas typically have a sloping bottom and, possibly
as a consequence, buoyant coastal currents may persist over long distances
under apparently unstable conditions. The stability of such currents is a
diﬃcult problem that hitherto has deﬁed unapproximated analysis; but see
Poulin and Swaters (1999) for recent progress. Extensions of the tractable
analysis due to Eady are pursued in this study as a source of guidance for
understanding the instability and in particular, the consequent eddy ﬂuxes
associated with coastal currents.

In an atmospheric setting, the eﬀect of a small bottom slope in the Eady
problem was studied by Blumsack and Gierasch (1972) as a prototype for
Martian climate. Mechoso (1980a,b) extended the theory to deal with two
sloping boundaries and applied it to the terrestrial atmosphere, with an
oceanographic discussion in Mechoso and Sinton (1981). de Szoeke (1975)
developed the bottom proﬁle into a perturbation series and discussed the
resulting hybrid instabilities.

2

These studies found substantially modiﬁed stability properties for changes
of the bottom slope, and as demonstrated at the end of the present investiga-
tion, it is possible to relax the necessary condition for instability altogether
to make the ﬂow unconditionally stable. For the eddy parameterizations
presently used in numerical models of the ocean, the growth rate is deter-
mined from the original Eady theory. Hence, such parameterisations do
not appear to be immediately applicable to coastal situations with sloping
boundaries.

The modiﬁcations caused by Ekman layers at the bottom boundary layer
are not obvious either. Holopainen (1961) discusses the eﬀect of Ekman
pumping in a two-layer model on a β-plane, noting that friction may broaden
the unstable wave-band while still retaining the short- and long-wave cutoﬀs.
Williams and Robinson (1974) generalized the Eady problem by combining
the eﬀects of a varying stratiﬁcation with Ekman pumping at one or two
boundaries. These authors found a destabilizing eﬀect on the short waves,
i.e. there is no parameter range with absolute stability.

The instability in the Eady problem is often discussed as resulting from
the meridional density- or temperature-gradient at the boundary. While
this argument is mathematically correct, the actual reason for the boundary
gradient is the intersection of sloping interior isopycnals with a horizontal
boundary. The intimate connection between the topographically modiﬁed
Eady waves and the quasigeostrophic edge waves touched upon by Rhines
(1970) is in the present context found to be important for the stability prop-
erties.

In the present work the growth rate and structure of the disturbances in
baroclinic instability of the Eady problem in the presence of topography and
friction are studied in more detail than previously (cf. Blumsack and Gierasch
(1972), Williams and Robinson (1974)), emphasizing the importance of the
isopycnal slope for the physical interpretation. The lower boundary is mod-
iﬁed to include a slope (Section 2) and Ekman pumping (Section 3) in order
to clarify their eﬀects on the oceanic stability problem.

The structure and stability properties of the solutions are found to be
substantially modiﬁed by the boundary conditions and are discussed in Sec-
tion 4 with emphasis on the physical background. From the analysis the
pure Eady problem emerges as a special case of a more general baroclinic
instability problem.

2 The Eady problem with boundary layer slope

The conﬁguration characterizing the continuous stability problem formulated
by Eady (1949) with a sloping lower boundary added is depicted in Figure
1. For the atmosphere, an analytical approach to the problem has been
pioneered by Blumsack and Gierasch (1972), whose analysis is extended here.
Dimensional forms of the equations are retained in order to keep close track of
the physics. The relevant scaling arguments can be found in e.g. Gill (1982),
whose notation we follow; a brief derivation of the governing equations is
presented to assist the discussion in Section 4.

as

with the perturbation velocity v.

To keep the formalism straightforward, only an interior solution at a
distance from the boundaries in the y direction is considered. The interior
region is wide enough to permit the growth of waves and to justify the absence
of Kelvin-wave-like boundary dynamics, but suﬃciently narrow to justify the
approximation of a small relative change in bottom depth: h = h(y)

H.

The mathematical problem posed by Equation (2) becomes tractable if
there are no gradients in the basic-state PV ﬁeld. In this case ∂q/∂y = 0,
U = U0z and the conservation law of Equation (2) becomes

The lower boundary condition should be evaluated at z = h, but for small
Rossby numbers it can be linearized around z = 0 (Blumsack and Gierasch,
1972); otherwise the baroclinic and barotropic parts are not separable. In
dimensional form, the condition is that h be small compared to H. At this
level of approximation, the bottom slope does not play a role for the hori-
zontal momentum balance, and thus Kelvin-like boundary waves are ﬁltered
out from the problem.

Taking N 2 constant, the variables are separated by writing

Non-trivial solutions for the system of equations (11)– (12) must be found

dition yields a somewhat complicated characteristic polynomial, which can
be simpliﬁed by deﬁning a number of non-dimensional variables.

One possible physical interpretation of ˜ω is as the ratio between the phase

A further notational simpliﬁcation is obtained by deﬁning the ratio be-

2.1 Solution properties

The standard Eady problem is recovered by setting ∆ = 0. It is readily found
that in this case imaginary values are possible only for 0 < rh < 2.39936, i.e.
the upper and lower boundaries must not be more than about 2.4 Rossby
heights apart (Eady, 1949).

With a sloping bottom boundary, the imaginary part of ˜ω for a range of
interesting ∆-values is given in Figure 2(a), where unstable solutions only
are possible within the contoured area. For opposing isopycnal and bottom
slopes, there is a strong stabilisation of long waves, while the short-wave cut-
oﬀ moves to even shorter waves. A narrow unstable region remains, however.
For slopes in the same direction, the maximal growth rate initially in-

Eady case when rh = 1.60609). For ∆ > 1, i.e. when the isopycnal slope
is smaller than bottom slope, no unstable solutions are to be found, a result
that is formally demonstrated in Section 4.2.

The real part of ˜ω in Figure 2(b) also shows intriguing characteristics
(Figure 2(a) is essentially similar
and seems to have escaped discussion.
to Figure 2 of Blumsack and Gierasch (1972) but these authors appear to
have neglected the contribution from the discriminant to the real part of
the solution. Note that de Szoeke (1975) gives a slightly diﬀerent stability
diagram, apparently because of his bounded y-domain.) It is readily seen
that in the unstable wedge, the waves are only weakly dispersive since ˜ω
increases in an approximately linear fashion towards rh ∝
const.
However, outside the unstable wedge and disregarding the very longest waves,
the waves are dispersive, implying that wave packages with diﬀerent wave
numbers would propagate away from each other.

k, i.e. c

The diﬀerent propagation characteristics are more understandable in the
light of the structure of the disturbances (Figure 3). It is recognised that
the dispersion properties are determined by the boundary at which the dis-
turbance is trapped; on the lower boundary, ˜ω

The wave properties and the resulting instability may be interpreted as
the interaction between two boundary waves (e.g. Bretherton (1966b)). For
˜ω+ and opposing isopycnal and topographic slopes (∆ < 0), the long waves
are conﬁned to the lower boundary. For increasing wavenumbers, the upper
boundary comes into play, and the perturbations on both boundaries start to
interact and grow in time, because the shear maintains their phase diﬀerence
while the mutually induced velocity ﬁeld tends to diminish it. For even larger
wavenumbers, the contribution from the lower boundary vanishes and what
remains is a stable wave on the upper boundary.

The most unstable solution diﬀers somewhat in character from the Eady
wave, since it is more conﬁned to the upper boundary. This is caused by the
sloping bottom boundary amplifying the vorticity contributions for small per-
turbations. The result is that in the interaction regime, larger perturbations
on the upper boundary are permitted, resulting in an overall ampliﬁcation
of the instability.

For ˜ω−, the situation is reversed:

long waves are found on the upper
boundary, short ones on the lower boundary, and in the interaction zone the
upper boundary perturbation is “upstream” of the lower boundary, which
gives rise to a destructive interaction.

Moreover, there is a narrow regime of negative frequencies for 0.4 < ∆ <
0.6 and 0.4 < rh < 0.6. The possible relevance of this regime to a more
realistic problem has not been discussed, but it appears as though the edge-
wave phase speed exceeds the Eady-wave phase speed in this regime, resulting
in wave progression with the coast on the right.

3 Eady problem with Ekman pumping on the

The eﬀects of a viscous boundary layer on the interior balance may be repre-
sented by diagnosing the vertical velocity at the top of the bottom boundary

The associated stability properties are shown in Figure 4. Note that
since a change in the sign of the isopycnal slope aﬀects both ∆ and the
dimensional version of ω (Eq. (14)), the ∆ν < 0 part of the ˜ω+ solution is
actually decaying, and vice versa for ˜ω−; the positive and negative solutions
0 region is
switch roles when ∆ν changes sign and hence only the ∆ν ≥
shown.

The stability characteristics of ˜ω+ in Figure 4(a) can again be understood
from the structure of the perturbations, as presented in Figure 5(a). For
the short waves that are stable in the Eady problem (rh > 2.4), there is a
change in the character of the solution with changes in ∆ν. The waning Eady
solution, which is bottom-trapped in the short-wave range, is barotropised
and becomes strongly decaying by increased Ekman pumping. The damping
increases exponentially in the long-wave limit rh →

0+.

The growing solution is top-trapped and destabilized for short wave-
lengths due to baroclinisation. Moreover, in the range rh > 2.4, the maxi-
mum growth rate is always found for non-zero values of ∆ν, since the Eady
solution ∆ν = 0 is stable.

The stability properties also manifest themselves in the phase speed of the
waves as an increase (decrease) for decaying (growing) long waves, cf. Fig-
ure 6.

4 Discussion

In the previous sections the eﬀect of the lower boundary condition on the
phase speed of baroclinic disturbances and their vertical trapping was found
to be substantial. Keeping in mind the basic mechanism of instability in the
Eady problem, we propose that any non-standard boundary condition that
modiﬁes the boundary-wave phase speed will aﬀect the stability properties in
a rather fundamental way. Some possible consequences of varying boundary
conditions and their interpretations are discussed in the following subsections.

This result for non-interacting boundary waves could also have been obtained
by inserting the exponential solution of Equation (13) separately into Equa-
tion (12) or Equation (11) and solving for c, yielding a wave solution for one
boundary only.

For the topographically modiﬁed Eady problem with positive shear, the
lower boundary phase speed is reduced by a boundary with a positive slope,
because the slope generates a quasigeostrophic edge wave that tends to travel
in the Kelvin-wave direction, opposite to the Eady wave and therefore decel-
erating it in the case of positive shear, but accelerating it if ∆ < 0. Indeed,
even negative phase speeds are possible on the lower boundary.

Within this approximation, there is a duality between Eady waves with
sloping isopycnals on a ﬂat bottom and edge waves with horizontal isopycnals
on a sloping bottom (cf. Rhines (1970)). The same phase speed as with
∂h/∂y = 0, σ = σ0 for clower is obtained with σ = 0 if ∂h/∂y =
σ0. The
duality is illustrated in Figure 7. For σ = 0, there are no unstable solutions.
Note also, that the phase speed on the lower boundary in the absence

as the Nof speed, being the speed at which eddies progress on a sloping
boundary. An explicit connection to the edge wave phase speed of Rhines

4.2 Surface temperature gradient vs. isopycnal slope;

the necessary condition for instability

It is customary to decompose the quasigeostrophic dynamics into contri-
butions from the interior PV and from the boundary temperature gradi-
ent (e.g. Hoskins et al. (1985)). Holopainen and Kaurola (1991) have crit-
icized this decomposition by arguing that the quantities depend on each
other, and when evaluated from observational data there is a high degree
of cancellation in the inverted ﬁelds over large scales (see also Davis (1993);
Holopainen and Kaurola (1993)). We brieﬂy revisit this issue from a stability
perspective.

The range of validity of the Poisson equation (6) may now be extended
to the full vertical domain, if the boundary conditions are generalised to a

Bretherton (1966a) was the ﬁrst author to suggest a form similar to Equation
(27), but without considering it as the divergence of a ﬂux.

(cid:19)

(cid:18)

The form of PV in Equation (27) is convenient when applying integral
theorems, such as the stability theorem of Charney and Stern (1962). This
theorem requires a change in sign of ∂ ˜q/∂y for instability. Since there are no
interior PV gradients in the Eady problem, the y-gradients in the boundary
PV contributions can be recognized as the source of instability (Bretherton,
1966a); compare Equation (27) with Equation (2).

It is now possible to pose the question whether the source of instability
at the lower boundary can be eliminated. This proves to be the case when
both contributions at z = 0 add to zero in Equation (27): f 2

This shows that the removal of the necessary condition for instability is
possible when the the bottom slope is equal or larger than the isopycnal slope.
This possibility for stabilisation is also remarked on by Charney and Flierl
(1981). The appropriate physical explanation, however, is found by recog-
nizing that the boundary density gradient, which is often referred to as the
source of instability, is a side-eﬀect of the isopycnal surfaces intersecting the
horizontal boundary.

In the stabilized case, the isopycnals intersect only the top boundary; they
do not feel the vorticity eﬀect of the bottom because they are “parallel” to it.
Hence, by removing the lower boundary PV source, the necessary condition
for instability is also removed, and the ﬂow is unconditionally stable, as seen
in the growth rates in Figure 2. (Mechoso (1980a) explained this removal of
instability using heat-transport arguments, but since the quasi-geostrophic

16

dynamics are determined by vertical velocity divergence, the heat ﬂuxes are
a consequence rather than a cause of the stabilisation.)

This result, strictly valid under the narrow limitations of quasi-geostrophy,
makes a lot of physical sense and is therefore expected to be relevant also for
non-quasi-geostrophic problems. Indeed, a parameter similar to ∆ appears
independently in several contexts in the literature, e.g. Swaters (1991) found
a similar condition for a non-quasi-geostrophic frontal model. However, other
types of instabilities that may emerge under diﬀerent approximations cannot
be ruled out.

For opposing isopycnal and bottom slopes, the necessary condition for
instability is fulﬁlled, but nevertheless considerable stabilisation of in partic-
ular long waves takes place already for very small bottom slopes, cf. Figure
2.

It is useful to note that the source of vorticity on the boundaries is due to
their impermeability, implying w = 0. The divergence of vertical velocity on
the boundaries is the source of the δ-function vorticity sheet, which makes the
angle between the isopycnals and the bottom the relevant parameter for the
phase propagation. The validity of this argument is born out by examining
Equation (4), which may be reformulated as

(cid:19)

(cid:18)
For the advecting y-part of D/Dt, Equation (4) yields w = vσ, i.e. the ﬂow
of v against the isopycnals causes a vertical velocity that diverges only when
σ changes or a boundary is encountered, as illustrated in Figure 8. This
divergence introduces a change of the interior PV, as indicated by (29). For
the linearized problem, the isopycnal surfaces of the basic state are imper-
meable. This isentropic upgliding (Hoskins et al., 1985) is exactly canceled
at the boundaries in the Eady problem by the boundary-induced velocity
(“boundary temperature advection”) to make the net w zero.

From a physical standpoint, it thus makes a lot of sense to divide the

quasi-geostrophic ﬂow into contributions from the horizontal vorticity (

and the modiﬁcations caused by divergence of vertical velocity ( ∂
∂z + δ-

functions), giving rise to the familiar phenomenon of vortex stretching. The
natural corollary of this argument is the second ﬂow partition suggested by
Holopainen and Kaurola (1991).

We further remark that it is customary to draw parallels between the
stabilisation caused by a bottom slope and the β eﬀect (Jungclaus, 1999;

Figure 8: Illustration of the divergence of vertical velocity in the Eady prob-
lem with a sloping bottom. A horizontal ﬂow against isopycnals is converted
into vertical velocity, which diverges where isopycnals intersect the bound-
aries, generating vorticity by vortex stretching. The bottom slope creates a
divergence of its own.

Spall and Chapman, 1998). There is, however, a clear diﬀerence between the
planetary vorticity gradient and the eﬀect of topography. The bottom slope
appears in the purely baroclinic problem as a δ-function vorticity contribu-
tion at the boundary, whereas the β-eﬀect is homogeneous over the whole
depth. Therefore, the eﬀect of the slope on the baroclinic instability is fun-
damentally diﬀerent from the β-eﬀect, whereas for the barotropic instability
H.
the eﬀect is the same, but only within the linearisation permitted by h
Furthermore, as Charney and Flierl (1981) point out, the variation of N with
depth in the ocean also makes the vorticity dynamics (and hence, the sta-
bility properties) deviate from those of the simple model based on constant
stratiﬁcation.

4.3 The sensitivity of eddy parameterisations

The recent decade has seen a rise of interest in parameterising the eﬀect of
eddies in coarse (viz. non-eddy-resolving) ocean models. Already a rather
coarse AGCM is capable of resolving the atmospheric eddies, whereas an
eddy-resolving OGCM is a major computational challenge that will be unaf-
fordable for routine research for many years to come.

Building on the atmospheric studies of Green (1970) and Stone (1972),

18

Visbeck et al. (1997) based their eddy parameterisation on the baroclinic in-
stability growth rate in the problem of Eady (1949). Subsequently, many
studies have found that a parameterization of eddy ﬂuxes based on the Eady
growth rate can be brought to reasonable harmony with eddy-resolving 3-
dimensional model results far from the lateral boundaries (Visbeck et al.,
1997; Jones and Marshall , 1997; Spall and Chapman, 1998), though only in
an ensemble-mean sense and with signiﬁcant error bars (Gille and Davis,
1998).

In light of the results from Sections 2 and 3 we may now inquire about the
sensitivity of the parameterisation schemes referred to above on the details of
the lower boundary, with emphasis on variations typically found in coastal-
ﬂow situations. Based on dimensional arguments (cf. Held (1999) for a recent
overview), an eddy-induced diﬀusivity is found to have a timescale T and a
length scale L associated with it such that

L2
T ∝

f
√Ri

l2.

κ

∝

(30)

(31)

The inverse of the instability growth rate (f √Ri
, as used by Visbeck et al.
(1997)) is a natural timescale in the eddy diﬀusion process, but the length
scale is more ambiguous. L may be determined by internal dynamics (cf.
Stone (1972)), or by the external geometry of the problem (e.g. the width of
the baroclinic zone, cf. Green (1970)). Hence,

ext.

Since a variation in ∆ or ∆ν is expected to aﬀect the internal length scales,
the inverse of the fastest-growing wavenumber has been taken to represent
the internal length scale for κint. Note that Lext is independent of ∆ and
∆ν, which implies a diﬀerence between κint and κext. Furthermore, because
of the dependence of ˜ωmax on ∆, the diﬀusivity and hence the eddy ﬂux will
be sensitive to ∆.

The dependence of κ on the bottom slope and Ekman pumping (∆) is de-
picted in Figure 9(a). The largest deviations from the standard Eady problem
are encountered when the eddy length scale is set by the fastest growing wave;
in the diagram κ is varying with a factor of 10 in the range
0.5 < ∆ < 0.5.

of ∆ and obtained a result which shows a pronounced similarity to our κint,
hereby providing support for our simple scaling argument.

However, if the diﬀusivity is governed by a ﬁxed external length scale, κ is
proportional to ˜ωmax and is therefore less sensitive to ∆. In case of bottom
Ekman pumping, the sensitivity of κ to ∆ is smaller than in the presence of
a sloping bottom, with κ varying only by a factor of two for 0 < ∆ν < 1.

Hence, when the deviations from the Eady problem are not large, it ap-
pears that the bottom slope exerts a strong inﬂuence on the eddy diﬀusivity
when the length scale is determined by internal dynamics. Furthermore, the
possibility for complete stabilisation in the case of a sloping bottom (imply-
ing zero diﬀusivity), and the destabilisation of short waves in the Ekman
layer case call for a development of new eddy parameterisations for coastal
waters.

5 Conclusions

The baroclinic instability mechanism requires the interaction between two
propagating PV disturbances. In the Eady problem these disturbances re-
sult from the divergence of vertical velocity at the solid boundaries, and are
therefore boundary-trapped. The relation between the isopycnal slope and
the bottom slope (or ratio of Ekman depth to horizontal wavelength) is the
single most important parameter in this problem.

The propagation speed of the disturbances inﬂuences the stability prop-

20

erties of the problem. An impermeable boundary which is not horizontal
leads to changes in the phase speeds of the disturbances. In particular, the
existence of short- and long-wave cutoﬀs appears to be especially sensitive
to the prescribed boundary conditions via the modiﬁcations these give rise
to in the boundary phase speeds.

Therefore it seems that an accurate representation of the Eady instability
growth rate in an eddy parameterization would require quite detailed knowl-
edge of the phase speeds of free Eady waves on horizontal boundaries. These
phase speeds, on the other hand, are sensitive to the details of the boundary
even in the quasi-geostrophic formulation. One may expect this sensitivity
to be carried over to mildly non-quasi-geostrophic dynamics.

The importance of the trapping boundary for disturbances is emphasized
in this study. In the Ekman-pumped Eady problem, all amplifying modes
are top-trapped and inclined against the shear in the Eady ampliﬁcation
sense. The eﬀect of Ekman pumping on the long waves is to reduce the
growth rate, but the same structural change causes a mild destabilisation
for short waves. The pumping translates the vorticity associated with the
top disturbance into a divergence in the bottom layer, thereby introducing
a small disturbance at the bottom. The top disturbance and its “slave” on
the bottom have a phase shift, which is responsible for the destabilisation.
Remarkably enough, a single disturbance in combination with a suitable
boundary condition suﬃces for the generation of instability.

The fairly large changes in the disturbance structure for bottom slope
or Ekman pumping are probably a useful guide when analysing observations
and model results, and since these eﬀects are almost inevitably present in
laboratory investigations, numerical models and observations, the classical
Eady problem may not be the best guide when interpreting experimental
results.

The solutions derived in this study indicate that idealized numerical eddy-
transport experiments without bottom slope or Ekman pumping may not
yield universally valid parameterizations. As has been shown here, there
are regions of parameter space where the stability properties of the quasi-
geostrophic problem diﬀer markedly from those found in the basic Eady
problem. Most importantly, there is a possibility for the removal of the
necessary condition of instability when the isopycnals are aligned with the
bottom slope. For larger slopes, Kelvin-wave dynamics become important
and the stability properties may be expected to diﬀer from those studied
here.

21

However,

for small slopes and small Ekman numbers, the maximum
growth rates do not diﬀer very much from those found in the unmodiﬁed
Eady problem. This probably explains the reasonably high level of success
enjoyed by eddy parameterizations based on the Eady growth rate.

The vertical-velocity and isopycnal-slope perspective applied throughout
this study serves as an interesting complement to the “IPV thinking” due
to Hoskins et al. (1985). The straightforwardness with which the stabilizing
inﬂuence of topography can be understood within the present conceptual
framework is a good argument for considering the interior as well as the
boundary contributions to vortex stretching in terms of divergence of verti-
cal velocity, as opposed to the less intuitively evident δ-sheets of PV. Since
boundaries have such a strong inﬂuence on the evolution of baroclinic pro-
cesses, a robust speciﬁcation of the boundary condition would be important
for inversion purposes. In addition, the speciﬁcation of a relevant boundary
density distribution in the real atmosphere or ocean may be more diﬃcult
than the speciﬁcation of large-scale isopycnal slope for use in the inversion
process.

The parameterisation derived by scaling arguments shows a strong de-
crease of eddy diﬀusivity with an increasing bottom slope when the mixing
process is governed by an internal length scale. Such a decrease is consis-
tent with the persistence of buoyant coastal currents. However, the quasi-
geostrophic theory does not appear to fully explain the observed persistence,
since even with opposing isopycnal and bottom slopes, there is a narrow
range of unstable wavenumbers. This unstable range would in principle be
suﬃcient to cause a disintegration of such currents. But in fact, the unstable
range is so narrow that a small modiﬁcation of the boundary wave propaga-
tion properties may be capable of stabilizing the ﬂow in toto, thus bringing
the theory into harmony with observations. Such a modiﬁcation is, however,
probably beyond of the scope of quasi-geostrophic analysis.

Sea state monitoring using coastal GNSS-R
F. Soulat, M. Caparrini, O. Germain, P. Lopez-Dekker, M. Taani and G. Ruﬃni1

We report on a coastal experiment to study GPS L1 re-
ﬂections. The campaign was carried out at the Barcelona
Port breaker and dedicated to the development of sea-state
retrieval algorithms. An experimental system built for this
purpose collected and processed GPS data to automatically
generate a times series of the interferometric complex ﬁeld
(ICF). The ICF was analyzed oﬀ line and compared to a
simple developed model that relates ICF coherence time to
the ratio of signiﬁcant wave height (SWH) and mean wave
period (MWP). The analysis using this model showed good
consistency between the ICF coherence time and nearby
oceanographic buoy data. Based on this result, preliminary
conclusions are drawn on the potential of coastal GNSS-R
for sea state monitoring using semi-empirical modeling to
relate GNSS-R ICF coherence time to SWH.

1. Introduction

Two Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are
presently operational: the US Global Positioning System
(GPS), and, to some extent, the Russian GLObal NAviga-
tion Satellite System (GLONASS). In the next few years,
the European Satellite Navigation System (Galileo) will be
deployed and GPS will be modernized, providing more fre-
quencies and wider bandwidth civilian codes. When that
happens, more than 50 GNSS satellites will be emitting
precise L-band spread spectrum signals which will remain
available for at least a few decades. Although designed for
localization, these signals will no doubt be used within the
GCOS/GOOS (Global Climate Observing System/Global
Ocean Observing System). This paper addresses coastal ap-

plications of the emerging ﬁeld known as GNSS Reﬂections
(GNSS-R), a passive, all weather bistatic radar technology
exploiting reﬂected GNSS signals, which aims at providing
instruments and techniques for remote sensing of the ocean
surface (in particular, sea surface height and roughness) and
the atmosphere over the oceans.

The Oceanpal project at Starlab focuses on the develop-
ment of technologies for operational in-situ or low-altitude
water surface monitoring using GNSS-R. Oceanpal (patent
pending) is an oﬀspring of technology developed within sev-
eral ESA/ESTEC projects targeted on the exploitation of
GNSS Reﬂections from space,
following the proposal of
Mart´ın-Neira [1993]. This instrument is to provide low
cost/low maintenance sea state and altimetry measurements
for coastal applications with the inherent precision of GNSS
technology.

We report here an experimental campaign dedicated to
sea-state monitoring using coastal GPS Reﬂections as gath-
ered and processed by the Oceanpal instrument. Altimetry
using GNSS-R is discussed elsewhere (e.g., in Caparrini et
al. [2003] and Ruﬃni et al. [2004] and references therein).
Section 2 describes the experimental campaign (instru-
mentation and data records) and the ground truth used for
validation of the results. A geophysical analysis based on
the correlation time of the reﬂected ﬁeld is then discussed
in Section 3. The results are compared to wind speed and
buoy observables—SWH and MWP.

2. Experimental campaign

The HOPE 2 (Harbor Oceanpal Experiment) experimen-
tal campaign gathered data from a ground platform in a
range of sea-state conditions.
It was carried out in De-
cember 2003 at the Meteorological station of Porta Coeli
belonging to the Barcelona Port Authority, located on the
port breakers (Figure 3). As sketched in Figure 1, two anten-
nas were deployed at approximately 25 meters over the open
sea surface to gather GPS-L1 signals. As usual in GNSS-
R, one antenna was zenith-looking (Right Hand Circularly
Polarized) to get the direct signal, and the other was ori-
ented towards the open sea surface with the complementary
polarization (Left Hand Circularly Polarization) to get the
reﬂected signals. The antennas were connected to the instru-
ment Front End, which then generated a digital bit-stream
of unprocessed GPS data at IF. The IF data were recorded
at a sample frequency of
16 MHz, processed on board to
produce complex waveforms, and transferred to the instru-
ment mass storage unit. The system also included a digital
video camera providing daytime optical records of sea-state
in the area (presence of swell, foam, breaking waves, calm
waters...) during the periodic data acquisitions.

∼

The campaign was divided into three parts (called Takes),
each of them lasting 3 to 4 days. Take 1 was dedicated to
the determination of the optimal position and orientation of
the antennas given the experimental site and will not be de-
scribed further. Take 2 took place from December 5th until
December 7th 2003, and Take 3 from the 12th to the 16th.
GPS-R and video data were gathered during 1 minute
every 4 hours in Take 2 and during 1 minute every 2 hours
in Take 3, with otherwise exactly the same set-up.

Figure 2. Wind speed at the Barcelona Port Porta Coeli
station during Take 2. Vertical bars indicate the occur-
rence of Oceanpal GNSS-R measurements.

The instrument computed direct and reﬂected correlation
waveforms using a coherent integration time of 20 ms. Satel-
lite visibility was limited by the presence of the pier: the
optimal mask angle was found to be [14o-35o] in elevation
and [70o-155o] in azimuth. This mask excluded satellites for
which a clear impact of ground reﬂections on the complex
reﬂected ﬁeld (essentially due to the pier) could be observed,
and represented an observation area of
100 m radius into
the open sea waters (with depths of about 20 m).

∼

A meteorological station at the experimental site pro-
vided the wind vector every minute. In addition, a Datawell
“Waverider” buoy located near the Llobregat Delta—10
miles South from the experimental site and 1.3 miles from
the coast (sea depth of 45 m)—delivered hourly SWH and
MWP. During the campaign, SWH ranged between 0.3 m
and 1.2 m.

Figure 2 shows wind speed during Take 2. The verti-
cal bars indicate the occurrence of Oceanpal measurements.
The wind speeds observed during the data gathering ranged
between 0 m/s and 12 m/s (U30). Observed wind directions
indicated that during a signiﬁcant portion of the time the
wind was blowing from land. Therefore, the sea state was
not expected to be signiﬁcantly wind-related.

Ruﬃni et al.
[2004] for more details on the STARLIGHT
tracking software). The software receiver initializes the pro-
cess (that is, ﬁnds satellites in view and selects those within
the mask), performs the correlations and tracks the delay
and Doppler of the direct GPS-C/A signal, feeding this in-
formation to the reﬂected signal correlation module. This
operation is typically carried out with 1–10 minute data seg-
ments (but limited to 1 minute in HOPE 2). The output of
this process is so-called Level 0 data, consisting of the times
series of complex waveforms for the direct and reﬂected sig-
nals. Level 0 data can then be used to produce Level 1 data
(such as the ICF discussed below or the altimetric lapse
discussed in Ruﬃni et al.
[2004]) and Level 2 geophysical
products (such as sea surface height or sea state related pa-
rameters, as discussed next). The software receiver carries
out other tasks, such as solving for the time and position of
the up-looking antenna.

The analysis for sea state begins with the interfero-
metric complex ﬁeld (ICF), deﬁned at time t by FI (t) =
FR(t)/FD(t), where FD and FR are the complex values at
the amplitude peaks of the direct and reﬂected complex
waveforms, respectively. The direct signal is thus used as
a reference to remove features unrelated to ocean motion,
such as any residual Doppler, the navigation bit phase oﬀ-
set, or direct signal power variability. The ICF contains very
valuable information on the sea state. More precisely, it is
the dynamics of the ICF which is of interest, as we discuss
below.

We note that the coherent integration process ﬁlters out
high frequency components of the ICF (i.e., those > 50 Hz
for the used 20 ms). This is a factor to take into account for
measurements in high seas (not the case in this experiment).
The goal of the analysis is to relate dynamics of the ICF
to sea-surface geophysical parameters. Given the very small
scattering area—we recall the instrument was deployed at
low altitude (
25 m) in this experiment—sea-surface rough-
ness parameters such as the Directional Mean Square Slope
(DMSS) are not foreseen to be quantiﬁable through the es-
timation of the width and orientation of the scattering area
(Delay-Doppler mapping), especially given the coarse nature
of the C/A code which is available today.

This equation, valid for small times, states that the autocor-
relation of the ﬁeld is a Gaussian function of ∆t and propor-
tional to a coeﬃcient depending on the sea surface elevation
standard deviation σz, surface autocorrelation length, lz,
geometry and antenna gain Gr.

The coherence time of the ICF is now given by the width

(second order moment) of this Gaussian function,

According to this model, τF depends on the electromagnetic
wavelength and the ratio between the correlation time of the
surface and the signiﬁcant wave height (an inverse veloc-
ity). A fundamental product of the instrument is therefore
τz/SWH = πτF sin ǫ/λ.

In order to check this model using buoy data (SWH and
MWP), we have derived a relation between MWP (available
from the buoy measurements) and the sea-surface correla-

tion time τz (needed to evaluate the right hand side of Equa-
tion 4), through Monte-Carlo simulations using a Gaussian
sea-surface spectrum (Elfouhaily [1997]). Simulating the
surface propagation at a given point z(xo, yo, t), the MWP
was estimated through the Fourier analysis of the time series
of z(xo, yo, t), while τz was determined by the width of the

Based on this analysis, the Level 0 to Level 2 data pro-
cessing involves two steps. First, the computation of the
autocorrelation function of the complex interferometric ﬁeld
is carried out. Then, a Gaussian is ﬁtted around lag zero to
provide the estimate of the coherence time (Level 1).

The comparison of the estimated ICF coherence time with
the available ground truth (wind speed, SWH and MWP)
is made through Equation 5. The results are shown in Fig-
ure 4 (left). As observed, the measurements correlate well
with theory. Note that there is also good consistency be-
tween Take 2 and Take 3 data.

It is worth mentioning that the linear relationship relat-
ing τz to MWP has been obtained under the assumption of a
fully developed sea. This assumption will not hold in general
in coastal areas for the whole range of sea-state conditions.

3.2.

ICF and SWH

Coherence time data can also be translated into Level 2
geophysical products such as SWH using a semi-empirical
algorithm, as we now discuss. We assume that the corre-
lation time of the surface is itself a function of the SWH
and write an expression for the “eﬀective” coherence time,
′
τ
τF sin ǫ = f (SWH), where in the open ocean f (SWH)
F ≡
is in general a known function of SWH but which will also
depend on the sea state maturity, fetch, bathymetry, etc. In
coastal areas, this function will be harder to estimate from
theory and a semi-empirical approach is envisioned.

Based again on the Elfouhaily [1997] spectrum we have
derived a linear relationship between τz and the SWH:

X - 4

τz = as + bs
SWH (as=0.167, bs=0.388, and an error of
0.03 s). This relation turns out to be rather independent of
wave age. Using it, we can now rewrite Equation 4 as

Since the instrument gathered coastal data (within
radius), the comparison with open ocean buoy data is not
direct. In order to compare open ocean data to coastal mea-
surements, we include a SWH “shift” parameter, SWH0 and
a scale parameter γ. The algorithm for translation of eﬀec-
tive ICF coherence time to SWH becomes, ﬁnally (Oceanpal

data. Figure 4 (right) plots SWH buoy data against Ocean-
pal SWH Algorithm 1. The algorithm standard deviation
from the buoy data is 9 cm.

4. Conclusions

GNSS-R is a budding new technology with a bright out-
look. Scientiﬁc and operational applications will clearly ben-
eﬁt from the precision, accuracy, abundance, stability and
long-term availability of GNSS signals. The combination of
GNSS-R data from air, ground and space can provide a co-
herent, long lasting oceanographic monitoring infrastructure
for decades to come.

In this paper we have highlighted an inexpensive, passive,
dry operational sensor concept for use on coastal platforms
and aircraft (for airborne applications focusing on sea state,
see, e.g., Zavorotny et al.
[2000] as well as Germain et al.
[2003]). Oceanpal is to provide precise sea level information
and sea state, and we believe it will occupy an important
niche in operational oceanography and marine operations.
Other marine applications of this technology (salinity, pol-
lution, currents) are also being studied.

The ground experiment described here showed that the
coherence time of the interferometric ﬁeld correlates well
with the ratio of MWP and SWH, as predicted by the ﬁrst
order model summarized in Equation 5, and that a semi-
empirical algorithm for SWH can also be devised. As ex-
pected in a coastal area, no strong correlation was found
between coherence time and wind speed, especially at low
wind speed regimes and directions associated with land ori-
gin. We also note that the buoy providing ground truth was
located relatively far away from the experimental site (10
miles south) and in the open sea as opposed to close to the
coast. Further experimental work with a closer buoy and/or
on an oﬀshore platform will aid algorithm development.

Based on this work, we foresee that ICF coherence time
will play an important role in the production of Oceanpal

sea state data, complementing well altimetric products. The
derivation of a directional model and extraction of other in-
formation from the ICF time series are under development
(Ruﬃni et al. [2004b]).

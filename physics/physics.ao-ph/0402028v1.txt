Abstract

In this paper, we discuss the impact of a rain forest canopy on the statistical char-
acteristics of atmospheric turbulence. This issue is of particular interest for under-
standing on how the Amazon terrestrial biosphere interact with the atmosphere. For
this, we used a probability density function model of velocity and temperature dif-
ferences based on Tsallis’ non-extensive thermostatistics. We compared theoretical
results with experimental data measured in a 66 m micrometeorological tower, dur-
ing the wet-season campaign of the Large Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment
in Amazonia (LBA). Particularly, we investigated how the value of the entropic
parameter is aﬀected when one moves into the canopy, or when one passes from
day/unstable to night/stable conditions. We show that this new approach provides
interesting insights on turbulence in a complex environment such as the Amazon
forest.

1 Introduction

Amazonia is one of the last great tropical forest domains, the largest hydro-
logical system in the planet, and plays an important role in the function of
regional and global climates. Many aspects of this fragile and highly complex
system remain unclear for the scientiﬁc community. A subject of great rele-
vance for understanding how the Amazon terrestrial biosphere interact with
the atmosphere is the correct modeling of the turbulent exchange of heat,
humidity, greenhouse gases, and other scalars at the interface vegetation-air.
This is partly due, on one hand, to the lack of high-frequency, detailed in-situ
measurements, and, on the other hand, to the fact that turbulence has been a
notoriously diﬃcult problem to grasp. While most researchers agree that the
basic physical aspects of the mechanically generated turbulence are described
by the Navier-Stokes equations, limitations in computer capacity make it im-
possible to directly solve these equations for high Reynolds numbers turbulent
ﬂows (fully developed turbulence), specially in a complex environment such
as the canopy of a rain forest.

Traditionally, the properties of turbulent ﬂows are studied from the probability
density functions (PDFs) of ﬂuctuating quantities (velocity diﬀerences vr(x) =
v(x) − v(x + r), for example), at diﬀerent separation scales r. It is a well
known characteristic of turbulent ﬂows that, at large scales, these PDFs are
normally distributed. However, at increasingly smaller scales, they become
strongly non-Gaussian and display tails fatter than expected for a normal
process. This is the signature of the intermittency phenomenon: strong bursts
in the kinetic energy dissipation rate. Since the sixties, many PDFs models
have been proposed to take into account this feature [1,2]. Most of these models
are based on reﬁned versions of Kolmogorov’s original phenomenology for
isotropic inertial subrange turbulence, such as in the lognormal [3], multifractal
[4], log-Poisson [5], and Levy [6] models.

Recently, a new PDF model based on the non-extensive thermostatistics (NETS)
formalism has been introduced [7]. Since then, the connection between NETS
and turbulence is attracting a growing interest [8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16]. NETS
is a generalization of classical Boltzmann-Gibbs thermostatistics [17], through
the introduction of a family of non-extensive entropy functionals Sq, with a
single parameter q. These functionals reduce to the Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy
as q → 1.

Within the context above, the objective of this paper is twofold. First, to
study the atmospheric turbulence in a complex environment such as the Ama-
zon forest. In particular, we focus on the impact of the rain forest crown on
the statistical characteristics of the atmospheric turbulence, and on how this
characteristics are aﬀected when one moves into the canopy, or when one

2

passes from day/unstable to night/stable conditions. We also investigate the
connection between coherent structures and intermittency on the statistical
distribution of turbulence ﬂuctuations. Our second goal is to test the validity
of the PDF model based on NETS, and whether this approach can provide new
insights to the study of atmospheric turbulence in the tropics. To achieve these
goals, we use fast-response experimental data obtained during the wet-season
campaign of the Large Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia
(known as the LBA Project), carried out during the months of January to
March of 1999, in the southwestern part of the Brazilian Amazonia.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe the data and
the experimental site. Section 3 contains the theoretical background. Results
are presented and discussed in Section 4. Finally, in Section 5 we present our
conclusions.

2 Data and Experimental Site

The experimental site is located in Rondonia, Brazil, roughly 3000 kilometers
northwest from Rio de Janeiro, inside the Jaru Biological Reserve, a densely
forested area with 270 thousand hectares. Fast response wind speed measure-
ments, in the three orthogonal directions, and temperature measurements were
made at a sampling rate of 60 Hz, using sonic anemometers and thermometers.
The data was gathered during an intensive micrometeorological campaign,
part of the wet-season LBA project. The experiment was carried out during
the months of January to March 1999. The LBA Project, acronym for Large
Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia, is an international ini-
tiative led by Brazil, aimed at understanding the climatological, ecological,
biogeochemical, hydrological functioning of Amazonia, studying the impact of
land use change, specially deforestation, in these functions, and analyzing the
interactions between Amazonia and the Earth system.

The measurements were made with the help of a 66 meters micrometeorolog-
ical tower, simultaneously at three diﬀerent heights: above the canopy, at 66
m, at the canopy top, at 35 m, and within the canopy, at 21 m. Two distinct
measurement periods have been selected: from noon to 1:00 pm, when the
forest crown is heated by the sun, the top of the canopy is hotter then the
surroundings, and thus the above canopy region is unstable; and from 11:00
pm to midnight, when we have the opposite condition, and the above canopy
region is stable. In order to verify the data quality, we applied the quality
control procedure proposed by Vickers and Mahrt [18]. We also checked the
validity of Taylor’s hypothesis verifying the turbulence intensity inside the
inertial subrange [19]. Finally, since we were primarily interested in the sta-
tistical characteristics of turbulence within the inertial subrange, we checked

3

our data for the existence of a sizable scaling range. We also computed the
approximate extension of the inertial sub-range using the value of the isotropy
coeﬃcient (which shall be close to one within the intertial sub-range) [20].

3 Theoretical Background

In this paper, we adopt a generalization of the model used in our previous
works [7,8,13], assuming that the PDF pq(vr) of turbulent velocity diﬀerences
vr (and also temperature diﬀerences Tr) is given by [14]:

pq(vr) = [1 − β(1 − q)[|vr|2α − Csign(vr)(|vr|α −

|vr|3α))]1/(1−q)/Zq, (1)

1
3

where C is a small skewness correction term, and Zq is given by

Zq =

B(φ0, χ0),

am0+1
α

q−1, m0 = 1−α

with B(φ0, χ0) = Γ(φ0)Γ(χ0)/Γ(φ0 + χ0), φ0 = (1 + m0)/2, χ0 = l − φ0,
l = 1
α , and a = ql/β. The parameter α was chosen according to
the empirical formula α = 6 − 5q. The main advantage of eq. (1) is to permit
the use of the same PDF model for handling both velocity and temperature
turbulent ﬂuctuations.

Neglecting the skewness correction term, we obtain for the PDF n-th moment:

< |vr|n >= amn−m0 B(φn, χn)
B(φ0, χ0)

,

where φn = (1 + mn)/2, χn = l − φn and mn = (n+1)−α

.

α

The parameters q and β determine the shape of the PDF and are obtained
through eq. (3), measuring the values of two moments (or related quantities)
at each scale (for example, the variance, < |vr|2 > and the kurtosis, Kr =
<|vr|4>
<|vr|2>2 ).

The parameter q depends on Kr through the equation:

(2)

(3)

(4)

Kr =

B(φ4, χ4)B(φ0, χ0)
B(φ2, χ2)2

,

4

Particularly for < |vr|2 >= 1, β is given by

β = l[

B(φ2, χ2)
B(φ0, χ0)

]2/(m2−m0),

(5)

We remark that the kurtosis depends only on the entropic parameter. It is
well known that large values of Kr are a signature of intermittency [2]. Thus,
q can be used as a measure of intermittency in turbulent ﬂows [15].

We also note that if we assume a scaling of the moments < |vr|n > of vr as
rςn (which is valid for inertial subrange scales, for suﬃciently high Reynolds
number), the scale variation of q and β can be computed (rather than mea-
sured). For this, we shall use the scaling relation together with equations (3)
and (4) to extrapolate the experimental values of q and β, at a given refer-
ence scale (say, the Kolmogorov scale, η). This extrapolation procedure can
be extended over a much wider range of scales [15] with respect to the inertial
subrange, by using the concept of extended self-similarity proposed in [21].
This approach requires to numerically solve the Kolmogorov equation using,
as initial condition, the observed value of q and β, at a reference scale.

4 Results and Discussions

4.1 Wind Velocity Data

Figures 1 and 2 present semilogarithmic plots of probability distributions of
daytime normalized vertical velocity diﬀerences vr = w(x) − w(x + r), at four
diﬀerent scales, properly rescaled and vertically shifted for better visualiza-
tion. Figure 1 data was measured above the canopy, inside the transition sub-
layer. Figure 2 data was measured approximately 14 meters below the canopy
top. Overall, we observe that the theoretical results (solid lines) are in good
agreement with measurements across spatial scales spanning three orders of
magnitude and a range of up to 10 standard deviations, including the rare
ﬂuctuations at the tail of the distributions. The transition from large-scale
Gaussian behavior to a power-law form as r decreases is quite evident and
well reproduced by the model. At small scales, the distributions have tails
larger than that expected for a normal process and a spiky shape near the
origin, an indicative of intermittency. We obtained similar agreement for the
PDFs of longitudinal velocity u diﬀerences (not shown in the text).

Comparing the histograms of Figures 1 and 2, we note that the kurtosis is
consistently higher within the canopy under diurnal conditions, regardless the
scale. To investigate with more detail this behavior, we plot in Figure 3, the

scale variation of the entropic parameter for u and w data, above and within
the canopy, under diurnal and nocturnal conditions. A few points can be
highlighted from these results.

First, we remark that all curves display a similar pattern: from a saturation
value, the entropic parameters qu and qw decrease as r grows. Theoretically,
q should tend to 1 at the integral scale and beyond. A similar trend has also
been observed in a Couette-Taylor ﬂow experiment [14].

Second, we note that the statistical characteristics of u and w wind-velocity
components are not the same, mainly at larger scales. This result was somehow
expected considering that our data was measured in a ”noisy” real atmosphere,
close to a very complex surface, such as the Amazon rain forest canopy.

Third, we observe that, indeed, under diurnal conditions, the entropic pa-
rameter is consistently higher within the canopy. However, this bias towards
higher levels of intermittency found in low level data disappears under noc-
turnal conditions, as shown in Figure 3b. In order to explain this behavior,
it is essential to examine the cyclic variation in the thermal stability regimes
above and within the canopy along a typical day, and the role of the forest

7

canopy in this process.

Schematically, during the day, dense forest canopies store heat in their highest
parts due to incoming solar radiation ﬂux. Hence, under daytime conditions,
the above canopy region is hotter than the surroundings, and, thus, unstable.
On the other hand, the region within the canopy is stable. There is a down-
ward ﬂux of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), which is mostly produced by
mechanical shear of the ﬂow next the canopy. During the night, the energy
budget is dominated by long-wave infrared radiation. Thus, the forest crown
looses heat, the stability proﬁle is reversed and stable conditions predomi-
nate above the canopy, and lightly unstable conditions may occur within the
canopy. Next to the ground, there is a small upward ﬂux of TKE generated by
thermally induced local ﬂows. This cyclic process determines variations on the
thermodynamic structure of the canopy, which inﬂuence the turbulent transfer
processes in this environment. This analysis suggests a simple scenario to ex-
plain the diﬀerent intermittency regimes observed in the data. In this scenario,
the forest crown act as a ﬁlter, breaking down large vortices while allowing
smaller ones to pass through the canopy. This ﬁltering process also explains
why stable regions have a higher intermittency level than unstable ones. We
remark that such eddy-ﬁlter character of forested canopies has already been
observed by other authors [22,23,24].

In order to test this scenario, we high-pass ﬁltered the original daytime above-
canopy signal, and measure at each scale, the corresponding entropic param-
eter. As we can see Figure 4, this procedure increases the signal kurtosis,
resulting in PDFs that are more similar to those found within the canopy dur-
ing the day. This result provides evidence that indeed the forest crown has a
ﬁltering eﬀect on large eddies, what impacts the intermittency level of the re-
maining velocity ﬁeld. Naturally, the real scenario is much more complex than
that, and is diﬃcult to establish a general and simple pattern for all turbulent
ﬂuctuations in the actual atmosphere. For example, the momentum exchange
process between the atmospheric ﬂow above and within the canopy is not con-
tinuous in time but characterized by strong intermittent transfers, associated
with the action of the so-called coherent structures, and characterized by a
sweep and an ejection phases [25].

4.2 Temperature Data

We also tested the PDF model given by eq. (1) with temperature data. To
illustrate, in Figures 5 and 6 we compare the theoretical PDFs with the exper-
imental histograms of daytime normalized temperature diﬀerences, above and
within the canopy, at four diﬀerent scales. Again, for each scale, we estimated
the variance and the kurtosis, and then computed the parameters q and β.

tered above canopy, and within canopy data.

Overall, we observe that the theoretical results (solid lines) are in good agree-
ment with measurements, mainly at the smaller spatial scales. The transition
from a power-law form at smaller scales to large-scale Gaussian behavior, as
the scale increases, is less evident than in the velocity histograms but is also
present. Comparing both histograms, we also note that, at smaller scales, they
are quite similar, but at larger scales, the above canopy data appears to be
more spiky, with heavier tails.

As we did previously, we study this trend plotting in Figure 7, the scale vari-
ation of the entropic parameter for temperature data, above and within the
canopy, under nocturnal and diurnal conditions. Again, we observe that ve-
locity and temperature curves display a similar pattern: from a saturation
value, q decreases as one goes to larger scales. However, we also remark that,
under both diurnal and nocturnal conditions, the entropic parameter is higher
above the canopy. In other words, the temperature signal appears to be more
intermittent above the forest crown, regardless the stability conditions. In this
case, it is worthwhile to ask why this behavior is diﬀerent from that observed
in the velocity data, which display diﬀerent patterns for day and night.

One possible answer is the existence of large-scale, ramp-like, coherent struc-
tures in the temperature ﬁelds. These structures are responsible for most of the
sensible heat transport through the canopy [26]. Since the strongest shear and

thermal gradients are located above the forest crown, we expect that ramp-
like structures will be more apparent above vegetated canopies than within
them [27]. These large scale, coherent structures are inﬂuenced by the local
boundary conditions and, through their interaction with smaller scales, aﬀect
inertial sub-range properties measured by q. If correct, this scenario suggest
that a ”universal model” of turbulence intermittency is very diﬃcult to be
deﬁned or may even not exist for canopy ﬂows. These ﬁndings have implica-
tions in the development of subgrid model of Large Eddy Simulation (LES),
now widely used to assess CO2 exchange [28], which are primarily based on
Kolmogorov type cascades or simplistic energy backscatter corrections [29],
as they are not capable to capture the eﬀect of large-scale motion on canopy
sublayer inertial range.

The impact of such large scale, coherent structures can be well illustrated
decomposing the turbulent data, by means of Haar wavelet ﬁltering [30], in
a coherent, intermittent part, and an incoherent, structureless part. This is
performed by removing from the original signal all wavelet coeﬃcients that
are larger than a given threshold. Comparing the experimental histograms of
the original signal (Figure 8) and the remaining incoherent signal (Figure 9),
we observe that the incoherent, decorrelated velocities display PDFs that are
roughly Gaussians, where the eﬀect of intermittency has almost disappeared.

Naturally, the corresponding power spectrum (not shown here) is much more
similar to that of a white noise.

Although the values of q for velocity and temperature are highly correlated,
they also convey information about diﬀerent aspects of the turbulent ﬂow: qw
about the momentum exchange process through the canopy, and qT about the
transport of sensible heat. Thus, properly combining the information on the
two entropic parameters, make it possible to assess the stability conditions
of the atmosphere. In Figures 10 and 11, we plot pairs of qw and qT , simul-
taneously measured at diﬀerent scales, for daytime and nighttime conditions,
above and within the forest canopy. As we can see, two diﬀerent stability
regimes are clearly visible.

Above the canopy (Figure 10), the atmosphere is thermally unstable dur-
ing the day (qw < qT ), and almost stable at large scales during the night
(qw ≈ qT ), although there are evidence of instabilities at smaller scales. On
the other hand, within the forest (Figure 11), the atmosphere is slightly un-
stable during the night (qw < qT ) and stable during the day (qw ≈ qT ). In
contrast with the usual stability criteria [31,32], which are essentially global,
the main advantage of the present approach is to assess the local atmospheric
conditions, at diﬀerent range of scales.

5 Conclusions

In this paper, we discussed the impact of a rain forest canopy on the sta-
tistical characteristics of atmospheric turbulence. This issue is of particular
interest for understanding on how the Amazon terrestrial biosphere interact
with the atmosphere. For this, we used a probability density function (PDF)
model of velocity and temperature diﬀerences based on Tsallis’ non-extensive
thermostatistics (NETS). This new approach allow us to use a single PDF
model to describe both the turbulent velocity and temperature diﬀerences in
the turbulent ﬂow.

We compared theoretical results with experimental data measured in a 66 m
micrometeorological tower, during the wet-season campaign of the Large Scale
Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA). We investigated in
detail how the value of Tsallis’ entropic parameter is aﬀected when one moves
into the canopy, or when one passes from day/unstable to night/stable condi-
tions. We observed that the forest crown break down large vortices, allowing
only smaller eddies to pass through the canopy, what increases the intermit-
tency level of the remaining turbulent velocity data. We also found that large-
scale, ramp-like, coherent structures in the temperature ﬁelds aﬀect inertial
sub-range properties increasing the kurtosis of the temperature signal above
the canopy. Finally, we showed that combining the information on qw and qT

14

make it possible to assess the stability conditions of the atmosphere within
and above the canopy.

In conclusion, we might say that the new approach described in this paper,
based on NETS, provides interesting insights on diﬀerent aspects of the atmo-
spheric turbulence in an complex environment such as an Amazon rain forest.
In this context, Tsallis’ entropic parameter emerges as a measurable quantity
which can be used to objectively quantify intermittency buildup in turbulent
atmospheric ﬂows.

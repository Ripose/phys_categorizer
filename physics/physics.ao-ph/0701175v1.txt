Abstract

There is signiﬁcant correlation between main development region sea surface temperature and the
number of hurricanes that form in the Atlantic basin. The correlation between the same sea surface
temperatures and the number of landfalling hurricanes is much lower, however. Why is this? Do we
need to consider complex physical hypotheses, or is there a simple statistical explanation?

1 Introduction

Boreal summer sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the tropical North Atlantic correlate well with the
number of hurricanes that form in the Atlantic basin in the same year (see, for example, our own analysis
in Binter et al. (2006a), as well as many previous analyses by other authors.). This correlation forms the
basis for a method for predicting future basin hurricane numbers: ﬁrst predict the sea surface temperature,
then predict the number of hurricanes given the sea surface temperature. However, for many it is not the
number of basin hurricanes that is of most interest, but the number of hurricanes that make landfall. And
on a purely ﬁnancial basis it is the number of hurricanes making landfall in the US that is most important.
It thus makes sense to ask: how well do SSTs correlate with the number of US landfalls? Much less well
than they correlate with the number of hurricanes in the basin, it turns out (see, for example, our own
analysis in Binter et al. (2006b), as well as various previous analyses.). This is perhaps a little surprising,
since landfalling hurricanes are just a subset of the hurricanes in the basin, and one might expect them to
inherit the same correlation with SST. We investigate what could be causing this reduction in correlation,
and, in particular, consider a simple statistical model to see whether the reduction in correlation should
If it can, then there is little motivation to
be expected on the basis of simple statistical arguments.
consider more complex hypotheses for why the correlation reduces, such as the possibility that the types
of hurricanes that make landfall are less aﬀected by SSTs than other types of hurricanes.

2 The eﬀects of sea surface temperature on hurricane numbers

In Binter et al. (2006a) and Binter et al. (2006b) we performed a thorough statistical analysis of the
relationship between main development region SSTs and the number of hurricanes in the basin and at
US landfall, respectively. We considered a number of diﬀerent periods of historical data, and a number
of diﬀerent statistical models that one could use to relate the two.
The main overall conclusion: relating SST to basin hurricanes is much easier than relating SST to
landfalling hurricanes. Comparing Binter et al. (2006a) and Binter et al. (2006b), this can be illustrated
by consideration of:

• linear correlations: the linear correlations between SST and hurricane numbers are around 0.5 for

the basin, and around 0.15 for landfalling hurricanes

• rank correlations: the rank correlations between SST and hurricane numbers are around 0.5 for the

basin, and around 0.2 for landfalling hurricanes

• standard errors on regression slopes: when we ﬁt linear regression lines between hurricane numbers
and SST we ﬁnd much larger (percentage) standard errors on the slopes of the lines between SST
and landfalling numbers than we do between SST and basin numbers

• scatter plots: the relationship between SST and hurricane numbers is very clear for basin hurricanes,

and not at all clear for landfalling hurricanes

• regression-based predictive studies: when we ﬁt regression models between SST and hurricane num-
bers we ﬁnd that we can make much better predictions of basin numbers than we can of landfalling
numbers

These results are qualitatively robust to changes in the period of data used and to using intense hurricanes
only.

3 Method

One possible explanation for the reduction in the SST-hurricane number correlation at landfall is that this
is purely a statistical eﬀect. We now investigate whether this is a reasonable hypothesis by running Monte
Carlo simulations to generate artiﬁcial basin and landfall data. We then look at how the correlation with
SST changes from basin to landfall in this artiﬁcial data set.
We ﬁrst create 5000 realisations of 50 years of surrogate SST data, by resampling the historical SST
data for the period 1950-1999. We then create 5000 realisations of 50 years of surrogate basin hurricane
number data, based on these SSTs, using the assumption that the number of hurricanes in a year is poisson
distribution with mean given by 6+5xSST , which is a simple approximation to the SST-hurricane number
relations ﬁtted in Binter et al. (2006a). Finally we create 5000 realisations of 50 years of surrogate landfall
hurricane number data, based on the simulated number of hurricanes in the basin in each year, and using
a constant probability that a basin hurricane will make landfall of 0.25.
We then repeat the whole experiment using 135 years of surrogate SST data.

4 Monte Carlo results

We now present the results from our Monte Carlo tests with 50 years of data. First, we consider the linear
correlation between SST and hurricane numbers, in the basin and at landfall. The top panel of ﬁgure 1
shows a histogram of the linear correlations for SST and basin numbers, based on the 5000 realisations
in our simulations (which give 5000 estimates for this correlation). The mean of the distribution is 0.48,
with some considerable spread. The lower panel of ﬁgure 1 shows a histogram of the linear correlations
for SST and landfalling hurricane numbers, based on the same realisations. The distribution has shifted
signiﬁcantly to the left: the mean of the distribution is now at 0.26, and again there is considerable
spread. This illustrates immediately that we should expect a reduction in the correlation with SST as a
simple statistical consequence of moving from basin to landfall.
We now ask the question:
if we were to do tests of the signiﬁcance of these correlation values, how
frequently would we conclude that the correlations are signiﬁcant in the two cases? This is illustrated
in ﬁgure 3, which shows the probability that we conclude there is not a signﬁcant relationship between
SST and hurricane numbers, versus the p-value used, for basin (top panel) and landfall (lower panel). At
p=0.05 we only conclude that there is no signiﬁcant relationship 6% of the time in the basin, while at
landfall we come to that conclusion 52% of the time.
We now show results for our Monte Carlo tests with 135 years of data. Figure 2 is the adapted version of
ﬁgure 1, and ﬁgure 4 is the adapted version of ﬁgure 3. The correlations shown in ﬁgure 2 have the same
means as before, but the distribution is now narrower, as a result of using more data in the estimation
process. The probabilities of concluding that there is no signﬁcant relationship reduce considerably. In
the basin case, at p=0.05, the probability is less than 0.01%: we are almost guaranteed to detect the
relationship if we have this much data. At landfall the probability of missing the relationship is 7%.

5 Conclusions

Observed SSTs correlate at around 0.5 with Atlantic basin hurricane numbers, and at around 0.2 for
landfalling hurricane numbers. Why is there this big reduction at landfall? We have shown that one
would expect just such a big reduction purely on statistical grounds: reducing the amount of data by

reducing the numbers of hurricanes per year reduces our ability to detect correlations with SST. This
does not, of course, prove that there aren’t other things going on as well that might aﬀect the correlation,
but it would seem likely that this is the principal eﬀect.

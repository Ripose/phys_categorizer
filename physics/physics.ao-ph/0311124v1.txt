ABSTRACT

The linearization of the meteorologial equations around a spei(cid:28)ed referene state,

usually applied in NWP to de(cid:28)ne the linear system of onstant-oe(cid:30)ients semi-impliit

shemes, is outlined as an unneessarily restritive approah whih may be detrimental in

terms of stability. It is shown theoretially that an inreased robustness an sometimes be

obtained by hoosing the referene linear system in a wider set of possibilities. The poten-

tial bene(cid:28)ts of this new approah are illustrated in two simple examples. The advantage

in robustness is not obtained at the prie of an inreased error or omplexity.

Introdution

The semi-impliit (SI) tehnique was proposed in the 70's (Robert et al., 1972) as a

suitable and e(cid:30)ient method for solving numerially the partial di(cid:27)erential equations used

in meteorology. At this time, the SI tehnique was applied to hydrostati primitive equa-

tions (HPE), and its suess in this ontext made it very popular in the (cid:28)eld of numerial

weather predition (NWP). The suitability of the SI tehnique for the fully elasti Euler

equations (EE) was then advoated (Tanguay et al. 1990), with the aim of ombining the

advantages of a system valid at any sale and an e(cid:30)ient time-disretization, as required

for NWP purposes.

The essene of SI shemes is a linear separation of the soure terms of the omplete

system to be solved, with an impliit treatment of this linear part. For the purpose of

this paper, three main types of SI shemes an be distinguished. The oe(cid:30)ients of the

implitly-treated linear terms an be : (i) onstant in time and horizontally homogeneous

(Simmons and Temperton, 1997 ; Bubnová et al., 1995, Caya and Laprise, 1999) ; (ii)

onstant in time only (Thomas et al., 1998 ; Qian et al., 1998) ; and (iii) non-onstant

(Skamarok et al., 1997, Cullen et al., 1997).

This paper only onsiders SI shemes belonging to the lass (i), whih are designed

under "onstant-oe(cid:30)ient SI shemes" in the following. However, it should be outlined

that sine only the separation of thermal terms is onsidered, all results and onlusions

extend identially to those SI shemes of type (ii) for whih the referene temperature is

horizontally homogeneous (e.g. Thomas et al., 1998 ; Qian et al., 1998).

The underlying priniples usually applied in the design of onstant-oe(cid:30)ients SI

shemes are the following :

(i) de(cid:28)ne a stationary SI referene basi state X ∗

;

3

(ii) linearize the meteorologial system M to be solved around this steady state, to

obtain a linear system L∗

;

(iii) treat the linear part of the evolution L∗

with a entred-impliit sheme, and the

remaining "non-linear" part (M − L∗) with a entred-expliit sheme.

However, due to the expliit treatment of the non-linear (NL) residuals, the stability of

this type of sheme is not formally guaranteed, espeially with long time-steps. Indeed, the

appliation of the above tehnique sometimes leads to unexpeted unstable behaviours.

The two following problems (referred to as P1 and P2 hereafter) illustrate the kind of

limitations whih an be enountered with onstant-oe(cid:30)ients SI shemes designed using

the priniples (i)(cid:21)(iii) :

P1 : With HPE, the introdution of a vertially varying referene thermal pro(cid:28)le T ∗

lose

to the atual atmospheri pro(cid:28)le, although reduing the magnitude of the thermal

NL residuals, leads to a sheme whih is less robust than when a warm isothermal

T ∗

pro(cid:28)le is used (see e.g. Simmons et al. 1978, SHB78 hereafter).

P2 : For two time-levels (2-TL) SI disretizations, the EE system is extremely unstable

while the HPE system is stable, as disussed in Bénard (2003, B03 hereafter).

As mentioned above, the onstant-oe(cid:30)ients SI tehnique has traditionally been ap-

plied to NWP by expliitly following the three priniples (i)(cid:21)(iii), but this method is

unneessarily restritive.

As stated in B03, the SI sheme an be viewed as the very (cid:28)rst iteration of a generalized

pre-onditioned (cid:28)xed-point algorithm for iteratively approahing the pure entred-impliit

sheme. In this light, L∗

appears to be nothing else than the linear pre-onditioner of the

(cid:28)xed-point algorithm (this pre-onditioner is neessary in suh an algorithm for allowing

the onvergene of the iterative proess). This point of view outlines the arbitrariness of

4

the hoie of the L∗

is ensured.

system, provided a satisfatory onvergene for the iterative algorithm

When faing unexpeted problems as (P1)(cid:21)(P2), a possible solution, advoated in

this paper, is to relax the onstraints (i)-(ii) and to seek L∗

deliberately as an arbitrary

onstant-oe(cid:30)ients linear system, i.e. not obtained through the linearization of M around

any referene state. This method is illustrated in the two following pratial examples.

2 Proposed solution to the problem (P1)

It is a well-doumented fat that if the stability of the SI sheme is obtained by foring

NL residuals to large values (in suh a way that their sign is ontrolled), then the response

of the sheme is deteriorated, espeially from the point of view of phase-speed errors.

When exaggerated, this strategy has a negative impat even on slower transient proesses,

making it unattrative for NWP. A natural way to alleviate this risk with ertainty is thus

to redue the magnitude of NL residuals. This is preisely the idea whih was tested in

SHB78, by omparing the properties of SI shemes obtained when hoosing isothermal

and non-isothermal pro(cid:28)les of the referene temperature T ∗

. The non-isothermal pro(cid:28)les

were hosen lose to standard atmospheri pro(cid:28)les, in suh a way that the magnitude of

thermal NL residuals was redued ompared to the ase with isothermal T ∗

. However,

the experimental results in terms of stability were learly worse for the non-isothermal

option : when the tropopause of the T ∗

pro(cid:28)le was above the atual one, the sheme

beame highly unstable. Given this experimental fat, the reommended solution, widely

followed afterwards, was to use a warm isothermal pro(cid:28)le for T ∗

, thus impliitly aepting

to sari(cid:28)e a better response of the sheme for an inreased robustness.

2.1 Analysis of SHB78 situation

In this setion, the HPE system in σ oordinate is onsidered with a three time-level

(3-TL) leap-frog SI time-disretisation. The theoretial framework proposed in B03 is

used here to perform a stability analysis, and the reader is referred to this paper for more

details on notations and algebrai developments. The framework is idealized in order to

allow simpler analyses (Cartesian vertial (x, z) plane without orography ; dry, adiabati,

non-rotating equations). A resting state X with a thermal pro(cid:28)le T (σ) is onsidered. All

atmospheri evolutions are assumed to onsist in small perturbations around X (referred

to as the "atual" state hereafter), and the meteorologial system M is linearized around

this state, in order to allow tratable analyses. In the notations of B03, the system thus

writes :

where D is the horizontal wind divergene, T the perturbation temperature, q = ln(πs)

, and πs is the surfae pressure. Note that in (2), the last RHS term is the ontribution

of vertial advetions for T . This Eulerian form an be shown, in this linear framework,

to be also valid for a semi-Lagrangian disretization, under the assumptions of perfet

solution for the displaement equation and perfet interpolators, onsistently with the

urrent spae-ontinuous ontext. A modi(cid:28)ed version of the σ -oordinate stati-stability

for the atual state X is introdued through :

(4)

γ =

.

For the referene state X ∗

used to de(cid:28)ne the SI sheme, a pro(cid:28)le T ∗(σ) is also assumed,

and the system is linearized around this referene state, aording to the above priniples

(i)(cid:21)(ii). The L∗

system and the stati-stability γ∗

obtained through this proedure are thus

formally idential to (1)(cid:21)(3) and (4), respetively, simply substituting T ∗

for T everywhere.

These two stati-stabilities (γ , γ∗

) are now assumed uniform in the whole domain for

the purposes of the analysis. A "non-linearity" fator is de(cid:28)ned by α = (γ − γ∗)/γ∗

. It

should be noted that the ase of an isothermal SI referene state is also inluded in this

formalism sine it results in a uniform stati-stability γ∗

. Following exatly the method

presented in B03, the system (1)(cid:21)(3) is (cid:28)rst transformed into an unbounded system :

= R∇2T

= −γD

ψ(x, σ) =

ψ exp(ikx)σ(iν−1/2)

The normal modes of the system are then :

where (k, ν) ∈ IR and ψ represents either D or T . Pursuing the analysis as in B03, it is

(cid:28)nally found that in the limit of long time-steps, the 3-TL SI sheme is stable for :

0 ≤ γ ≤ 2γ∗.

(10)

This result extends (and is fully onsistent with) those obtained in previous related studies

(SHB78, and Cté et al. 1983, CBS83 hereafter). Moreover, it allows an understanding

b

7

of the instability observed in SHB78 for their SI sheme with non-isothermal referene

pro(cid:28)les : when the tropopause of the SI referene state is higher than the tropopause of

the atual state, the above riterion (10) is loally violated between the two tropopauses,

resulting in an unstable sheme. However, for warm isothermal pro(cid:28)les of T ∗

, the latter

instability disappears, as empirially found by SHB78, beause in this ase, γ∗

has a

high value at any level, and therefore is larger than γ/2 in all the depth of atmosphere,

whatever may be the loation of the atual tropopause.

2.2 Proposed modi(cid:28)ation

The fundamental di(cid:27)erene between the two options examined by SHB78 is not in

the values of T ∗

themselves (whih atually deviate marginally between the two types

of onsidered referene thermal pro(cid:28)les T ∗

), but in the presene or not of the advetive

system, beause this term dramatially modi(cid:28)es the apparent

term (dT ∗/dσ) in the L∗

stati-stability γ∗

, as seen in (4).

Hene, aording to the new approah proposed in this paper, a natural solution to

ensure a more stable sheme while keeping a non-isothermal T ∗

pro(cid:28)le, is to deliberately

remove the resulting advetive term in the initial L∗

system. This modi(cid:28)ation an be

expeted to ombine both the advantages of small residuals (beause T ∗

an be made

loser to atual atmospheri thermal pro(cid:28)les) and optimum stability (beause the ap-

parent stati-stability in the L∗

mathematial struture of the L∗

T ∗

pro(cid:28)le is exatly the same as for a traditional SI sheme with an isothermal T ∗

, hene

system in this modi(cid:28)ed SI sheme with a non-isothermal

system is large at any level). It is worth noting that the

the modi(cid:28)ation in any pre-existing appliation is straightforward.

In order to illustrate the onsequenes of this modi(cid:28)ation, a situation lose to the one

examined in SHB78 is onsidered. A lass of vertial thermal pro(cid:28)les is introdued by :

,

(cid:19)#

(11)

where T0 = 220 K, γ0 = 30 K, and σT is a varying parameter speifying the level of the

tropopause. The value σ∗

T = 0.25 is hosen for the SI referene state T ∗

, while for the

atual state T , the tropopause level σT is left as a free parameter in the interval [0.1, 0.5].

The stati-stability is γ = (R/Cp)T0 = 62.9 K in the isothermal (T = T0) "stratosphere",

and γ0 = 30 K in the "troposphere" for both T and T ∗

pro(cid:28)les. The only di(cid:27)erene

between the two pieewise-onstant pro(cid:28)les of stati-stability (γ , γ∗

) is thus the loation

of their tropopause.

The stability analysis is not straightforward for suh multi-layers systems, hene the

stability of the systems is diagnosed through vertially-disretized analyses exatly as

in CBS83. In this method, the whole vertially- and time-disretized system for a given

horizontal mode is onsidered as a linear "ampli(cid:28)ation matrix" ating on a generalized

vertial state-vetor, and the growth rate Γ of the system is the maximum modulus of the

set of eigenvalues of the ampli(cid:28)ation matrix. The vertial struture of the most-unstable

mode is given by the assoiated omplex eigenvetor. The vertial disretisation in the

analyses presented here is the same as in Simmons and Burridge (1981), and is equivalent

to the one used in SHB78. The vertial domain is desribed through 80 regularly-spaed σ

levels, and the analyses are performed for a mode with k = 0.0005m−1

(the results are not

qualitatively sensitive to k). As diussed in B03, the examination of the stability in the

limit of long time-steps is relevant sine long time-steps area target in NWP. The value

hosen here is ∆t = 2000 s (here also, smaller time-steps do not hange qualitatively the

onlusions).

The growth-rates for the traditional SI sheme and for the proposed modi(cid:28)ed SI sheme

are depited as a funtion of σT in Fig. 1. For the traditional SI sheme, the results are

9

fully onsistent with the riterion obtained through the above analysis (it has also been

heked that a slight inrease of the tropospheri stati-stability γ0 from 30 to 35 K

results in a stable sheme for any value of σT in the explored interval, in agreement

with the stability riterion derived above). For the traditional design used in SHB78, the

SI sheme is unstable as soon as the atual tropopause is lower than its SI referene

ounterpart. For the modi(cid:28)ed SI sheme proposed here, the stability is obtained even in

the previously unstable situation, and is thus omparable to the ase with an isothermal

T ∗

pro(cid:28)le.

In this analytial ontext, the modi(cid:28)ed sheme reahes the initial aim of reduing

the magnitude of NL residuals while ensuring a robust sheme. The extension of these

theoretial results to fully realisti frameworks has not been investigated further, but the

approah seems worth onsidering sine it potentially ombines the two advantages of

robustness and auray.

3 Proposed solution to the problem (P2)

A stability analysis of the EE system in the spae-ontinuous SI framework, proposed

in B03, shows that the 2-TL time-disretisation is very unstable in the presene of thermal

NL residuals, while the HPE system are aeptably stable in the same ontext.

As in the above setion, a theoretial analysis reveals the auses of this dramati

destabilization in simpli(cid:28)ed ontexts. In the following, it is shown that the destabilization

originates from the fat that the thermal NL residuals orresponding to the terms respon-

sible for gravity and elasti waves systematially have opposite signs. To better illustrate

this explanation, the following ouple of exerpts from the omplete linearized EE system

in σ vertial oordinate [see (52)(cid:21)(56) in B03℄ an be examined :

where all notations follow B03.

The (cid:28)rst sub-system desribes the horizontal propagation of gravity waves, while the

seond desribes the vertial propagation of elasti waves. Negleting the Boussinesq e(cid:27)et

represented by the term "+1" in the RHS of (14), these two sub-systems are formally

idential, the only notieable di(cid:27)erene being the loation of the T fators (at numerator

vs. denominator). As a onsequene, for a given set of atual and referene temperatures

) the thermal NL residuals always have an opposite sign in the two systems. For the

purposes of the analysis, the thermal pro(cid:28)les T and T ∗

an be onsidered as isothermal.

(T , T ∗

Let α = (T − T ∗)/T ∗

be the thermal non-linearity parameter for the onsidered simpli(cid:28)ed

problem. The stability properties of the (cid:28)rst sub-system for α are thus the same as those

of the seond sub-system for −α/(1 + α). Sine the stability of the (cid:28)rst sub-system (in

2-TL SI) for long time-steps implies α ≤ 0 (see B03 for details), the stability of the seond

sub-system neessarily implies α ≥ 0, and the stability domain for a omplete SI system

whih would inlude the two types of waves thus vanishes. In other words, if T ∗

is hosen so

as to stabilize horizontally propagating gravity waves, then vertially propagating elasti

waves will be unstable, and vie versa. The problem is of ourse not present for HPE sine

this system does not allow the propagation of elasti waves.

11

A natural solution to restore systematially the same sign for thermal NL residuals

in the above two sub-systems, is thus to introdue di(cid:27)erent values of T ∗

for eah sub-

system, that is : T ∗

for the gravity-wave system (12)(cid:21)(13), and T ∗

E for the elasti-wave

system (14)(cid:21)(15). Noting T ∗

E = rT ∗

, the stability domains for the (cid:28)rst and seond system

beome α ≤ 0 and (r−1) ≤ α respetively. As a onsequene, hoosing r < 1 allows a non-

empty stability domain for long time-steps to be restored. In terms of temperature, the

stability is then ensured if T ∗

E ≤ T ≤ T ∗

in this isothermal ontext. The stability domain

for T an thus be arbitrarily extended, by setting T ∗

arbitrarily warm, and T ∗

E arbitrarily

old, with the limitation that an exaggeration in this diretion (cid:28)nally deteriorates the

response of the sheme, as outlined above.

The appliation of this solution to the omplete EE system is straightforward : for all

ourenes of T ∗

at numerator in the initial linear system [i.e. the referene system L∗

assoiated to (52)(cid:21)(56) in B03℄, the traditional warm value T ∗

should be kept, while for

the ourenes of T ∗

at the denominator, the old value T ∗

E should be imposed. Here also,

the modi(cid:28)ation from any pre-existing appliation is straightforward.

The theoretial impat of this modi(cid:28)ation is (cid:28)rst illustrated with a stability analysis

of the omplete EE system for 2-TL SI shemes in the ontext of isothermal T and T ∗

pro(cid:28)les and linear evolution around X as in B03. The analysis for T ∗

E = T ∗

is given in B03,

and an be repeated in a formally similar way for the modi(cid:28)ed SI sheme T ∗

E 6= T ∗

. The

growth rates obtained in the long time-step limit for the initial and modi(cid:28)ed SI shemes

are depited in Fig. 2, for r = 1 and r = 0.5 (i.e. T ∗

E = T ∗/2). The results are fully

onsistent with the above simple analyses : the modi(cid:28)ed SI sheme is found to be stable

in the interval (r − 1) ≤ α ≤ 0, while the traditional SI sheme is always unstable.

In order to evaluate the potential bene(cid:28)t of the proposed approah for NWP, the modi-

(cid:28)ation was then tested in real-ase onditions with the adiabati semi-Lagrangian version

12

of the Aladin-NH model (Bubnová et al. 1995), used with a 2-TL SI time-disretization.

The model was integrated for 3 hours for a randomly-hosen situation onsisting of a

strong (cid:29)ow over real topography, in a domain whih inludes the montanous Pyrénées

region. The horizonal resolution is 2.5 km in horizontal diretions, and the time-step is

80 s. The vertial oordinate is the mass-based hybrid oordinate de(cid:28)ned in Simmons and

Burridge (1981), and the domain is disretised along 41 irregular layers with a thikness

inreasing with height, in the usual NWP fashion. Integrations are performed without any

time-(cid:28)lter (see B03 for a disussion on the detrimental e(cid:27)ets of time-(cid:28)lters in 2-TL SI

EE system). A weak fourth-order horizontal di(cid:27)usion is applied to avoid the aumulation

of energy in the smallest resolved sales during the ourse of the integration.

Fig. 3 shows the evolution of the whole domain spetral norms of the horizontal vor-

tiity ζ and divergene D for the traditional and modi(cid:28)ed versions of the 2-TL SI sheme.

The traditional SI sheme is used with T ∗ = T ∗

E=300K, and the modi(cid:28)ed SI sheme with

T ∗

=300 K, T ∗

E =150 K. The original 2-TL SI sheme is learly unstable, sine the integra-

tions diverge after 11 time-steps, while the modi(cid:28)ed 2-TL SI sheme behaves stably during

the 3 hours of the integration. This experiment learly indiates a potential advantage of

using the modi(cid:28)ed SI sheme in NWP with 2-TL EE systems.

4 Comments and onlusion

All the disussions in this paper apply equally to 2-TL and 3-TL shemes. They an

also be extended straightforwardly from SI shemes to the emerging lass of iterated

entred-impliit (ICI) shemes, as examined in B03, beause these shemes are based on

the same kind of linear separation of the meteorologial system to be solved impliitly.

For the problem (P2), the proposed solution o(cid:27)ers a smaller interest for 3-TL shemes

13

than for 2-TL shemes, beause 3-TL shemes already have a degree of robustness om-

patible with a NWP use as far as thermal NL residuals are onerned. Nevertheless, the

proposed solution is believed to be worth onsidering for high resolution modelling with

the EE system in ombination with 2-TL shemes For the EE system disretized with

2-TL SI shemes, it may allow in partiular to remove the strong time-(cid:28)lters used so far,

with their detrimental e(cid:27)ets in terms of response. Moreover, it would be interesting to

extend this modi(cid:28)ation to systems in height-based oordinates. It is worth noting also

that the two modi(cid:28)ations proposed in setions 2 and 3 ould be ombined to obtain a

stable 2-TL sheme together with thermal NL residuals of smaller magnitude.

More generally, the aim of this paper is to emphasize that there may be a onsiderable

bene(cid:28)t to relax the unneessarily onstraining priniples (i)(cid:21)(ii) for the design of all kinds

of impliit shemes based on a linear separation (SI and ICI shemes). In pratie, starting

from an initially unstable sheme obtained through the traditional approah, a dramati

improvement may sometimes be obtained if the approah proposed here is used for modi-

fying this initial sheme in only slight details. The disussions in this paper learly do not

o(cid:27)er a omplete piture of the properties of the modi(cid:28)ed shemes proposed above om-

pared to their traditional ounterparts. Before extending suh modi(cid:28)ations to the atual

NWP framework, it would be neessary to evaluate more preisely their pratial impat

in terms of auray and response oretness on foreasts performed in real onditions.

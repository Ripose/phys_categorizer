Abstract

The present study investigates linear and volatile (nonlinear) correlations of ﬁrst-
order autoregressive process with uncorrelated AR (1) and long-range correlated
CAR (1) Gaussian innovations as a function of the process parameter (θ). In the light
of recent ﬁndings [1], we discuss the choice of CAR (1) in modeling daily temperature
records. We demonstrate that while CAR (1) is able to capture linear correlations it
is unable to capture nonlinear (volatile) correlations in daily temperature records.

1 Introduction

Noise at the dynamical and measurement level often encourages the choice of
stochastic interpretation of time series data. Detrended ﬂuctuation analysis
(DFA) [2, 3] and its extensions [4–6] have been used widely to determine the
nature of correlations from stochastic processes obtained from a wide-range of
systems [7]. These studies have subsequently suggested the choice of stochastic

models to explain complex behavior observed in synthetic and natural data
sets [1]. The objective of the present study is to understand the scaling be-
havior of the ﬁrst-order stochastic processes and their volatility series [4] as
function of the process parameter. Based on the results obtained for the var-
ious parameter regime, we evaluate the choice of these processes in modeling
real-world temperature data [1].

2 First order auto-regressive process and its extension

2.1 AR (1) with uncorrelated Gaussian innovations

Classical AR (1) is given by the expression

xn = θxn−1 + ǫn, n = 1..N,

(1)

where ǫn represents independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) Gaussian
innovations with zero mean and unit variance. The corresponding volatility
series of (1) is given by yn = |xn−xn−1|, where |w| represents the absolute value
of w. Correlations in yn imply that clusters of (small) big changes are likely
to be followed by clusters of (small) big changes. It can be shown analytically
that Eqn. (1) is stationary when |θ| < 1 i.e. −1 < θ < 1. The autocorrelation
function (ACF) of (1) decays exponentially and is of the form ρ(k) = θk
for lag k. The nature of the decay is governed by the process parameter θ.
While ρ(k) = θk exhibits an exponential decay for (0 < θ < 1), it exhibits an
exponential decay with oscillations for (−1 < θ < 0). It is important to note
that (−1 < θ < 0) and (0 < θ < 1) represent cases where the current sample is
negatively and positively correlated with its immediate past, respectively. The
strength of the short-term correlated and short-term anti-correlated behavior
is dictated by the process parameter θ.

2.2 AR (1) with long-range correlated Gaussian innovations, CAR (1)

We also consider the case where ǫn in (1) is generated by a long-range corre-
lated Gaussian process [8]. This extended AR (1) with long-range correlated
Gaussian innovations shall be referred to as CAR (1) in the subsequent sec-
tions. The choice of the term CAR was encouraged by recent studies [1]. In
the light of recent ﬁndings [1], we critically evaluate the choice of CAR (1) for
modeling real-world daily temperature records.

3 Results and discussion

A complete description of DFA and its extensions can be found elsewhere
[3–5]. In the present study, the length of the data sets is chosen suﬃciently
larger N = 214, in order to avoid bias in the estimation procedure due to ﬁnite
sample-size eﬀects. DFA with fourth order polynomial detrending is used in
order to minimize bias due to local polynomial trends [4, 9]. We also integrate
the data prior to DFA estimation and scale the resulting ﬂuctuation function
by the window size [4]. The ﬂuctuation function of uncorrelated noise α = 0.5
and the long-range correlated noise α = 0.8 and α = 0.65 shall be used as
reference in the subsequent discussions.

3.1 AR (1) with uncorrelated Gaussian innovations

As noted earlier (Sec. 2) AR (1) process is stationary for −1 < θ < 1. In
the present study, we consider parameters (θ = −0.1 and 0.1) and (θ =
−0.93 and 0.93) . While the former is close to the uncorrelated regime (θ = 0),
the latter is close to the non-stationary regimes, θ = −1 and θ = 1. Log-log
plots of the ﬂuctuation function versus time scale for AR (1) and its volatil-
ity series with θ = 0.1 and − 0.1, Fig. 1a, is parallel to exponent 0.5 in the
asymptotic regime, with a slight deviation from 0.5 in the short time scales for
θ = −0.1. A similar analysis was carried for process θ = 0.93 and − 0.93 Fig.
1b. Unlike θ = ± 0.1 whose ﬂuctuation function is relatively homogenous,
characteristic crossovers are observed for θ = ± 0.93 and their volatility series,
Fig. 1b. For θ = 0.93, the log-log plot of the AR (1) process displayed cor-
related behavior at short-time scales and uncorrelated behavior at the larger
time scales α ∼ 0.5. However, for θ = −0.93 , one observes a characteristic
crossover from anti-correlated behavior for time scales (s < 30) to uncorre-
lated behavior for (s > 30). The volatility series for θ = 0.93 was homogenous
and exhibited an exponent of (α ∼ 0.5) characteristic of monofractal data [4],
whereas that of θ = −0.93, displayed a marked crossover from correlated to
uncorrelated behavior.

From the above discussion, it is clear that the process parameter θ has a signif-
icance impact on the scaling behavior at shorter time scales. This is reﬂected
by marked distortions and cross-overs in the ﬂuctuation plots. It can also be
noted that irrespective of the choice of θ, the scaling in the asymptotic regime
resembles that of an uncorrelated noise, α = 0.5.

3.2 AR(1) with long-range correlated Gaussian innovations, CAR (1)

Long-range correlated Gaussian innovations ǫn with scaling exponent of (α =
0.8) [8] was used to generate CAR (1). The ﬂuctuation function of CAR (1)
process for θ = ±0.1 were parallel to each other and to ǫn (α = 0.8), see Fig. 2a.
The corresponding volatility series displayed an exponent of 0.5 characteristic
of monofractal data. Thus the scaling behavior of CAR (1) is similar to that
of AR (1) for process parameter θ close to zero.

For θ = −0.93, at short time scale s < 35, CAR (1) is highly anti-correlated
however the behavior mimicked that of ǫn (α = 0.8) for s > 40, Fig. 2b. For θ =
0.93, short time scales had an exponent α ∼ 1.75 close to the integrated version
of ǫn (α = 0.8). However, in the asymptotic regime the scaling exponent was
that of ǫn (α = 0.8), Fig. 2b. Fluctuation function obtained for the volatility
series (θ = 0.93) was parallel to the reference line with slope 0.5 characteristic
of monofractal data. However, the ﬂuctuation function of the volatility series
(θ = −0.93) displayed correlated behavior at short time scales (s < 200) and
uncorrelated behavior (α ∼ 0.5) in the asymptotic regime. As in the case
of AR (1), the process parameter θ has a signiﬁcant impact on the scaling
behavior of CAR (1) process, revealed by marked distortion and crossovers in
the log-log plots.

3.3 Critical note on the choice of CAR (1) to model temperature correlations

It has been shown [10, 11] that atmospheric temperature data (from a ran-
domly chosen 14 continental regions) display power correlations with DFA
exponent α = 0.65 and this is considered as universal persistence behavior
of the temperature data. Using this result as a benchmark, the quality of the
temperature data simulated by the Global Climate Models has been evaluated
[12]. In a later study [13] it has been shown that temperature data from conti-
nental and costal zones display lesser deviations from the previously observed
universal behavior (exponent) of 0.65 while the islands display greater vari-
ability with the average exponent being close to 0.8 [14]. In a recent study, [1]
CAR(1) process was proposed as a plausible model for explaining correlations
in atmospheric daily temperature ﬂuctuations collected from fourteen meteo-
rological centers in Hungary. The choice of the CAR (1) model was inspired
by the fact that temperature records exhibit both short-term and long-term
correlations [1, 7]. We generated the data using the CAR (1) model proposed
by in [1]

xi = (α1 − c)xi−1 + δηi.

The model parameters were chosen as α1 = 0.8, δ = 2.1, ηi is zero-mean, unit

α = 0.65, ρ = α − 0.5, c = 2ρ3/2 as in [1].

Log-log plot of the ﬂuctuation function of Eqn. 2, Fig. 3, displayed strong
correlations with exponent (α = 0.85) at short scales (s < 100). However,
in the asymptotic regime it displayed an exponent (α ∼ 0.65) close to that
of the long-range correlated Gaussian innovations. Fluctuation function of
the corresponding volatility series was parallel to (α = 0.5), characteristic
of monofractal processes. This has to be contrasted with recent studies [7],
which provided compelling evidence of long-range correlations (α = 0.6) in
the volatility series of daily temperature ﬂuctuations. Such long-range volatile
correlations were observed across randomly chosen and spatially separated me-
teorological sites across the world. This in turn was attributed to universality
in daily temperature records [7].

It has been shown that long range correlated data with exponents 0.5 ≤ α <
1.5 will exhibit uncorrelated behavior in volatility analysis while the multifrac-
tal signals exhibit long range correlations in volatility analysis [4, 6]. As the
CAR (1) model, Eqn. 2, is driven by a linear process (see above), one would ex-
pect the model to display uncorrelated behavior in the volatility analysis and
is indeed the case obtained for this model. Since, the CAR (1) model Eqn.2
[1] captures the linear features of the temperature data (as the volatility ex-
ponent is 0.5 for this model), it will be unable to account for the nonlinear
features in the data irrespective of the choice of the process parameter, as
demonstrated by Figs. 2 and 3. Equation (2) [1] does show distinct scaling
behavior with a marked crossover, however, it is not appropriate for modeling
the dynamics of daily temperature records. In [1], the authors subsequently
proposed a nonlinear counterpart of CAR(1) model, termed NLCAR(1) in or-
der to capture the probability distribution of the daily temperature records.
The DFA results obtained in [1] for NLCAR(1) and CAR(1) were indistin-
guishable (for details we refer to [1]). However, this does not necessarily imply
NLCAR(1) and CAR(1) have similar volatile correlations. Recent studies [15]
have used nonlinear stochastic models successfully to model glacial dynamics
also reﬂected in long-range volatile correlations. Encouraged by previous ﬁnd-
ings [4, 7, 15] and results presented in [1], we believe that NLCAR(1) may be
a more appropriate model to capture dynamics of daily temperature records.

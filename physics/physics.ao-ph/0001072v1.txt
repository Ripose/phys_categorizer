Monodisperse approximation in the metastable

phase decay

V.Kurasov

Abstract

A new simple method for the ﬁrst order phase transition kinet-
ics is suggested. The metastable phase consumption can be imag-
ined in frames of the modisperse approximation for the distribution
of the droplets sizes. In all situations of the metastable phase decay
this approximation leads to negligible errors in the total number of
droplets appeared in the system. An evident advantage of the pre-
sented method is the possibility to investigate the situation of the
metastable phase decay on several sorts of heterogeneous centers.

Attempts to give a theoretical description for the ﬁrst order phase tran-
sition appeared practically simultaneously with creation of the classical nu-
cleation theory [1]. An idea to give the global description of the ﬁrst order
phase transition was attractive and induced many publications (for example,
see Wakeshima [2], Segal’ [3]). But all of them were intended only to estimate
the main characteristics of the phase transition. The time of the cut-oﬀ of
the nucleation clearly observed in experiments was adopted in these publica-
tions without any proper justiﬁcation. The ﬁrst theoretical description with
explicit determination of time behavior of supersaturation was given in [4]
where a homogeneous condensation was investigated. The method used in
[4] was an iteration solution of integral equation of a substance balance.

To give a global picture of phase transition one has to take into account
a presence of active centers of condensation. The iteration method can be
spread on heterogeneous condensation on similar centers (see [5]), but for con-
densation on several types of centers one can not calculate iterations with

1

a proper accuracy (see also [5]). The system of condensation equations be-
comes so complex that it can not be directly solved without simpliﬁcations.
As the result it would be rather attractive to suggest some simple approxi-
mations which can be used in the complex situation of the condensation on
several types of centers. Certainly, this approximation has to be well based.
Here we shall suggest a monodisperse approximation of the droplets size
distribution to calculate the number of molecules in the liquid phase. From
the ﬁrst point of view this approximation is strange - we have already at-
tracted attention to the necessity to know the behavior of a supersaturation
which determines the form of the droplets size spectrum. But here we are
going to show that with an appropriate choice of the cut-oﬀ (which can be
also justiﬁed) one can give an adequate description of a nucleation period.

The monodisperse approximation presented here diﬀers from the total
monodisperse approximation used in [7] for description of the intensive con-
sumption of the metastable phase and can not be applied during a nucleation
period. Here we use a special modiﬁcation of the mentioned approximation
which allows to describe the period of nucleation.

This publication is intended to give the main idea of the monodisperse
approximation which would be clear for experimenters. That’s why we start
from situations of homogeneous condensation and heterogeneous condensa-
tion on similar centers which can be solved even without this approximation.
Some technical details are excluded to give the most clear version (for exam-
ple, a complete version of limit situations and monodisperse approximation
in the intermediate situation is described in [6], the overlapping of the inter-
mediate and limit situations is analysed in [8], the transition of the special
monodisperse approximation to the total one is discussed in [9]).

We use the physical model of nucleation kinetics described in [5]. It is
rather standard but to avoid misunderstanding we shall consider [5] as the
base of references.

1 Homogeneous nucleation

The condensation kinetics equation for the number G of the molecules in the
liquid phase can be written in a well known form [4], [5]

G(z) = f Z z

0

dx(z − x)3 exp(−ΓG(x))

(1)

2

where parameter f is the amplitude value of the droplets sizes distribution
Γ is some ﬁxed positive parameter.

One can analyse behavior of subintegral function g deﬁned by

G(z) = Z z

0

g(z, x)dx

(2)

as a function of a size ρ = z − x, z. This function has the sense of the
distribution of the number of molecules in droplets over their sizes ρ.

In some ”moment” z ( or t(z)) it can be presented in the following form

• When ρ > z it is equal to zero (there are no droplets with such a big

size)

• When ρ < 0 it is also equal to zero (there aren’t droplets with a negative

size)

• At the intermediate ρ it grows rather quickly with a growth of ρ. It is

easy to note that it grows faster than ρ3 grows.

Really, if one takes into account that supersaturation decreases in time
then we get g ∼ ρ3. But supersaturation falls in time and there aren’t so
many droplets of the small size as of the big size.

As the result one can see that the function g as the function of ρ has the
sharp peak near ρ ≈ z. This property takes place under the arbitrary z (or
t(z)).

The sharp peak of g allows to use for g the monodisperse approximation
- a representation in the δ-like form with a coordinate corresponding to a
position of the peak of function g, i.e.

g ∼ δ(ρ = z)

As the result one can state that the monodisperse approximation is based
now. But it is necessary to determine the number of droplets in this approx-
imation.

It would be wrong to include the total number of already appeared
droplets in this peak. Really, in the spectrum of sizes there are many droplets
with small sizes. One can not describe these droplets as containing the same
substance as the droplets of a big size. It would be more correct to exclude

3

them from the substance balance. So, it is necessary to cut oﬀ the small
droplets. It can be done according to two recipes.

The ﬁrst recipe is the diﬀerential one. One can note that during all times
which don’t exceed the time of nucleation essentially the function g near
maximum is close to

gappr = f ρ3

This approximation corresponds to the constant value of supersaturation.

One can cut oﬀ this approximation at a half of amplitude value (i.e. at a
level f z3/2). Then one can get for the width ∆dif f z the following expression

∆dif f z = (1 − 2−1/3)z

This cut oﬀ means that all droplets ρ < z − ∆dif f z are excluded from
consideration and all droplets with ρ > z − ∆dif f z are taken into account in
a δ-like peak.

The second recipe is the integral one. One can integrate gappr and require

that

An integration gives

Z z

0

gappr(z, x)dx = Nz3

Z z

0

gappr(z, x)dx = f Z z

0

(z − x)3dx = f

z4
4

The width of spectrum is deﬁned from condition that the number of droplets
has to be equal to the amplitude multiplied by the width of spectrum ∆intz:

This gives the following expression

N = f ∆intz

∆intz = z/4

One can see that ∆dif f z and ∆intz practically coincide. This shows the
high selfconsistency of this approximation. The second recipe will be more
convenient for concrete calculations.

In ﬁg.1 one can see the application of the monodisperse approximation in

the homogeneous case.

4

As the result one can say that all parameters of approximation are deﬁned.

Now it will be used to solve (1).

Instead of (1) one can get

where

G(z) = N(z/4)z3

N(z/4) = f z/4

is the number of droplets formed until t(z/4). This leads to

G(z) = f z4/4

which coincides with the resulting iteration in the iteration method [4], [5].
It is known (see [4], [5]) that this expression is very accurate which shows the
eﬀectiveness of the monodisperse approximation. Here the cut oﬀ of the tail
of the sizes spectrum compensates the unsymmetry of the initial spectrum.
The main result of the nucleation process is the total number of the

droplets which can be found as

or

where

Ntot = f Z ∞

0

dx exp(−ΓG(x))dx

Ntot = f Z ∞

0

dx exp(−f Γz4/4) = f 3/4Γ−1/4D

D = Z ∞

0

exp(−x4/4)dx = 1.28

The error of this expression is less than two percents (it is the same as in

the iteration method).

2 Heterogeneous condensation on similar cen-

ters

The condensation equations system can be written in the following form [5]

G(z) = f Z z

0

dx(z − x)3 exp(−ΓG(x))θ(x)

5

θ(z) = exp(−bZ z

0

exp(−ΓG(x))dx)

with positive parameters f , b, Γ. An appearance of a new function θ which is
a relative number of free heterogeneous centers requires the second equation.
The ﬁrst equation of the system is rather analogous to the homogeneous
case. The subintegral function here is also sharp. A function θ is a decreasing
function of time according to the second equation of the system. Then the
function g which is again determined by (2) is more sharp than in the homo-
geneous case. As far as the supersaturation has to fall one can see that g is
more sharp than gappr. It allows to use here the monodisperse approximation
for all z or t(z).

As the result the monodisperse approximation is based for heterogeneous
condensation. One needs here only the sharp peak of g(ρ) which can be easily
seen.

The successive application of the monodisperse approximation in the ho-
mogeneous case shows that all droplets necessary for a metastable phase
consumption at t(z) were formed until t(z/4). In the heterogeneous case the
exhaustion of heterogeneous centers increases in time. So, all essential at
t(z) droplets were formed before t(z/4).

At the same time the presence of a long tail in the situation of a weak
exhaustion of heterogeneous centers requires to cut oﬀ the spectrum for the
monodisperse approximation. As far as the long tail is essential in the situa-
tion of a weak exhaustion one has to cut oﬀ the spectrum by the same recipe
as in the situation of the homogeneous condensation: one has to exclude all
droplets formed after z/4 which have the sizes ρ < z − ∆intz = z − z/4.

One can see in ﬁg. 2 the monodisperse approximation in the situation of
the heterogeneous condensation on similar centers. The form of the spectrum
in this situation is illustrated in ﬁg. 3. So, the way to construct approxima-
tion is known. Now one can turn to concrete calculations.

The number of the droplets formed until t(z/4) has to be calculated as

N(z/4) =

f
b

(1 − θ(z/4))

An approximation for G has the form

G(z) =

f
b

(1 − θ(z/4))z3

6

The total number of droplets can be determined as

Ntot =

f
b

(1 − θ(∞))

or

or

or

Ntot =

f
b

(1 − exp(−bZ ∞

0

exp(−ΓG(x))dx))

Ntot =

f
b

(1 − exp(−bZ ∞

0

exp(−Γ

f
b

(1 − θ(z/4))z3)dz))

Ntot =

f
b

(1 −exp(−bZ ∞

0

exp(−Γ

f
b

(1 −exp(−bZ z/4

0

exp(−ΓG(x))dx))z3)dz))

The last expression has a rather complicate form. It contains several itera-
tions in a hidden form which ensures the high accuracy.

The last expression can be simpliﬁed. One of the possible recipes is the
following. One can note that an expression for G is necessary at ΓG ∼ 1.
Then z attains some values ∆ζ z. But until ∆ζz/4 the value ΓG is small and
exp(ΓG(z)) is close to unity. This leads to simpliﬁcation of last expression
which can be written in the following form

Ntot =

f
b

(1 − exp(−bZ ∞

0

exp(−Γ

f
b

(1 − exp(−bz/4))z3)dz))

Then one can fulﬁl calculation according to the last formula. The relative
error is less than two percents. Here it is a little bit greater than in the
homogeneous case because the form of initial spectrum is changed and there
is no full compensation of the unsymmetry of spectrum and an exclusion of
the tail. The relative error in the situation of heterogeneous condensation on
similar centers is drawn in ﬁg. 4.

Now one can turn to explicit calculation of the integral in the last expres-
sion. After the appropriate renormalization the subintegral function is more
sharp than exp(−x3) and more smooth than exp(−x4). Both these functions
have a sharp back front of spectrum. It allows to introduce the characteristic
scale ∆z by equation

f
b

Γ(1 − exp(−b(∆z)/4))(∆z)3

≈ 1

7

Then

where

Z ∞

0

exp(−Γ

f
b

(1 − exp(−bz/4))z3)dz = ∆z

A + B

2

0

A = Z ∞
B = Z ∞

0

exp(−x3)dx = 0.89

exp(−x4)dx = 0.90

Now the calculation is reduced to some algebraic manipulations. The

error of the last approximation is less than one percent.

As the result

Ntot =

f
b

(1 − exp(−b∆z

A + B

2

))

One can note that it is possible to formulate the recipe already in terms
of ∆z. The long way is adopted here to give the most clear picture for the
monodisperse approximation.

3 Nucleation on several types of heteroge-

neous centers

The main advantage of monodisperse approximation is the possibility to use
it for the condensation on the several types of centers. The iteration proce-
dure can not be applied in this case successfully. The result of calculations
according to [5] shows this fact explicitly. The reason is the existence of the
cross inﬂuence of the diﬀerent types of centers through vapor consumption.
In the condensation on similar heterogeneous centers in the situation of
exhaustion the inﬂuence of this phenomena on the vapor consumption isn’t
important because in the situation of consumption the converging force of the
heterogeneous centers exhaustion is extremely high. But in the situation with
two types of heterogeneous centers the exhaustion of the ﬁrst type centers
can have a certain inﬂuence on a vapor consumption but the exhaustion of
the second type centers is weak and there is no converging force due to the
weak exhaustion of the second type centers.

This eﬀect in very thin and it can not be taken into account in the second
iteration. But one can not calculate the third iteration analytically and this
stops an application of iterations. Really, this phenomena isn’t evident from

8

the ﬁrst point of view but it exits and leads to the error of the second iteration
in many times.

The application of the monodisperse approximation is based on the sharp-
ness of function g. This property takes place already in this situation. So,
there are no objections to apply the monodisperse approximation here.

Here we shall reproduce the same formulas but with the lower indexes

which determine the sort of heterogeneous centers.

The system of condensation equations can be written in the following

form [6]

Gi(z) = fi Z z

0

dx(z − x)3 exp(−ΓXj
exp(−ΓXj

0

θi(z) = exp(−bi Z z

Gj(x))θi(x)

Gj(x))dx)

where the lower indexes denote the sorts of centers. This system can be seen
by the direct generalization of the one type case.

The subintegral function in the substance balance equations is also sharp.
As far as all θi are the decreasing functions of arguments then the function g
deﬁned by (2) (with proper indexes) is sharper than without the exhaustion
of heterogeneous centers. So, due to the supersaturationdecreasing g is more
sharp than gappr. It allows here to use the monodisperse approximation for
all z or t(z).

As the result one can see that the monodisperse approximation in this

case is justiﬁed on the base of the sharpness of g(ρ).

The same properties as in the previous case can be also seen here. One
has to cut oﬀ the spectrum at z/4. Here all justiﬁcations are absolutely same
as in the previous section. The characteristic situation for the nucleation on
two types of heterogeneous centers is drawn in ﬁg.5. As the result the way to
construct the monodisperse approximation is known. Now one can present
calculations.

The number of the droplets formed until t(z/4) on the centers of sort i

has to be calculated as

Ni(z/4) =

fi
bi

(1 − θi(z/4))

An approximation for Gi can be now presented as

Gi(z) =

fi
bi

(1 − θi(z/4))z3

9

The total number of droplets is deﬁned as

Ni tot =

fi
bi

(1 − θi(∞))

or

or

or

Ni tot =

fi
bi

(1 − exp(−bi Z ∞

0

exp(−ΓXj

Gj(x))dx))

Ni tot =

fi
bi

(1 − exp(−bi Z ∞

0

exp(−ΓXj

fj
bj

(1 − θj(z/4))z3)dz))

Ni tot =
(1 − exp(−bj Z z/4

0

fj
bj

Xj

fi
bi

(1 − exp(−bi Z ∞

0

exp(−Γ

exp(−ΓXk

Gk(x))dx))z3)dz))

Now one can simplify the last expression by the same way as in the one type
case.

Expressions for Gi are essential at ΓPj Gj ∼ 1. Then z is near ∆ζz.
Until ∆ζz/4 the value ΓPj Gj is small and exp(ΓPj Gj(z)) is near unity. It
leads to

Ni tot =

fi
bi

(1 − exp(−bi Z ∞

0

exp(−ΓXj

fj
bj

(1 − exp(−bjz/4))z3)dz))

Now one can fulﬁl the calculations according the explicit formula. The
relative error of the last expression is less than ﬁve percents (here it increases
slightly due to the complex form of the spectrums on diﬀerent sorts. The
relative error in the number of droplets is drawn in ﬁg. 6. The calculation of
the last integral is absolutely analogous to the previous section. The subin-
tegral function after renormalization lies between exp(−x3) and exp(−x4).
It allows to get the characteristic size ∆z from

fj
bj

ΓXj

(1 − exp(−bj(∆z)/4))(∆z)3

≈ 1

Then

Z ∞

0

exp(−ΓXj

fj
bj

(1 − exp(−bjz/4))z3)dz = ∆z

A + B

2

10

The relative error of the last expression is less than one percent.
As the result

Ni tot =

fi
bi

(1 − exp(−bi∆z

A + B

2

))

The formula is similar to the ﬁnal expression in the previous section. But
parameters in the last formula have to be determined in another manner.

The physical sense of the last expression is the separate exhaustion of
heterogeneous centers. One sort of centers can inﬂuence on the other sort
only through a vapor consumption. This fact can be seen also in the initial
precise system of the condensation equations.

Monodisperse approximation in homogeneous condensation. Here one can
see four pictures for diﬀerent periods of time (or for diﬀerent values of z. One
can introduce ∆z according to ΓG(∆z) = 1 and it will be the characteristic
scale of the supersaturation fall. In part ”A” z = ∆z/2, in part ”B” z = ∆z,
in part ”C” z = 3∆z/2, in part ”D” z = 2∆z. One can see that the spectrums
in part ”A” and part ”B” are practically the same. It corresponds to the
property of the similarity of spectrums until the end of the nucleation period.

Monodisperse approximation in condensation on the similar centers. The
value ∆z is the same as in the previous ﬁgure (i.e. it is determined without
the exhaustion of centers). Now ΓG(∆z) < 1 and ∆z will be the character-
istic scale of the supersaturation fall in the situation without exhaustion. In
part ”A” z = ∆z/2, in part ”B” z = ∆z, in part ”C” z = 3∆z/2, in part
”D” z = 2∆z. One can see that the spectrums in part ”A” and part ”B”
aren’t similar. Now all spectrums are more sharp than in the homogeneous
case.

One can see two curves which are going from ρ = z to the small sizes
ρ. The lower curve corresponds to the real spectrum calculated with account
of heterogeneous centers exhaustion. The upper curve corresponds to the
condensation without exhaustion of heterogeneous centers which is the worst
situation where there is converging force due to the centers exhaustion.

Concrete situation drawn here corresponds to b = 2 after renormalization
(the values of parameters f and Γ can be canceled by appropriate renormal-
ization). The value of z here equals to 3∆z/2.

The solid lines correspond to the precise numerical solution. The dashed
lines correspond to application of monodisperse approximation. One can not
separate the numerical solutions from the approximate ones except the slight
deviation in the region of small ρ. As far as all (precise and approximate)
solutions will go to zero there will be no deviations for z ≫ ∆z (i.e. we stop
at the worst moment).

The relative error of approximate solution for the nucleation on the sim-
ilar heterogeneous centers. Here the values f and Γ can be canceled after
renormalization and there remains only one parameter b which is the argu-
ment of the function drawn here. It is clear that this function is small. All
asymptotes can be checked analytically (see [9]).

Characteristic behavior of size spectrums for nucleation on two types of
heterogeneous centers. One can cancel f1, Γ by renormalization. One can
put f2 < 1 due to the choice of centers. Here b1 = 2, f2 = 1/2, b2 = 1/2.
The value z is taken as 2∆z (see ﬁg.1). The are three curves here. The
lower one corresponds to the spectrum of droplets formed on the ﬁrst type
centers, the intermediate one corresponds to the droplets size spectrum for
the second type centers, the upper one corresponds to the spectrum calculated
without exhaustion of heterogeneous centers (the reasons are the same as in
ﬁg.3). The solid lines are the numerical solutions, the dashed lines are the
approximate solutions. One can not see the diﬀerence for the lower curve.
For the upper and intermediate curve one can see only very slight diﬀerence.
All spectrums are renormalized to have one and the same amplitude (which
is marked by f ).

Relative error for the nucleation on two types of centers. For two types of
centers there exists ﬁve parameters (two of them can be canceled by renormal-
ization). We have already adopt that Γ is one and the same for diﬀerent types
of centers (for the reasons see [8], for numerical results see [9], for analytical
estimates see [10], for recipes of calculation in this situation see [11]). We
cancel here f1, Γ. We consider f2 < 1 and the ﬁrst component is the leading
component in the metastable phase consumption. So, the worst situation for
the error in the droplets number formed on the second type centers (which is
drawn here) will be when b2 = 0 and the is no converging force of the centers
exhaustion. So, there remain two parameters f2 (it is marked by f ) and b1
(which is marked by b). One can see that the error is small. The calculations
for the variations of all parameters give the same value of error but it is hard
to reproduce these numerical results.

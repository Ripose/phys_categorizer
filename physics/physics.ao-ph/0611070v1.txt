Abstract

In earlier work we considered methods for predicting future levels of hurricane activity based on
the assumption that historical mean activity was at one constant level from 1900 to 1994, and has
been at another constant level since then. We now make this model a little more subtle, and account
for the possibility of four diﬀerent levels of mean hurricane activity since 1900.

1 Introduction

We want to predict the number of hurricanes that might occur during the next hurricane season, and
we want to make that prediction as soon as the current season is over. We call this problem ‘year-
ahead’ prediction of hurricane numbers, to distinguish it from ‘seasonal’ predictions of hurricane numbers,
which are generally made from a point in time closer to the hurricane season being predicted. Seasonal
predictions often use predictors in the atmosphere and ocean that correlate with hurricane activity (see,
for example, Saunders and Lea (2005), Gray (1984), Gray et al. (1992), Gray (1993) and Gray (1994),
Elsner and Schmertmann (1993), Landsea et al. (1999), Landsea (2000), Lehmiller et al. (1997)). These
predictors are generally less useful, however, at the long lead time that we are considering, and we therefore
take a rather diﬀerent approach, based on the idea of using linear combinations of the historical hurricane
number data as a prediction of the future number of hurricanes. The particular linear combinations we
consider put diﬀerent weights on diﬀerent periods of historical data according to how similar those data
are to the current levels of activity.
Our ﬁrst attempt in this direction (described in Jewson et al. (2005)) was to assume that historical
hurricane activity was at one (constant) level of mean activity from 1900 to 1994, and jumped to another
(constant) level of mean activity from 1995 to 2005. We then assumed that 2006 would remain at the
new level of mean activity, and predicted this new level of activity using a combination of the estimated
levels of mean activity from 1900 to 1994 and 1995 to 2005. We formulated the problem mathematically
as a mean-variance trade-oﬀ: the recent data is (according to our assumptions) unbiased, but too short
to give accurate estimates. The earlier data is biased, but long enough to make our estimates much
more accurate. An appropriately weighted combination of the data from the two periods can then
give a prediction with MSE lower than the predictions from either period individually, and we derived
expressions that give an estimate of the weights needed to make this combination.
Perhaps the biggest objection that one might make to this initial study (in terms of realism), is that
no-one really thinks that hurricane activity was at one constant level from 1900-1994. A more common
point of view is that activity levels were low in the early part of the 20th century, higher in the middle of
the century, low again until the mid 1990s, and then high again. The goal of this article is to extend our
analysis to account for this idea. Instead of modelling hurricane numbers in two periods of constant levels
of activity, we now model it in four periods. Otherwise, our method is exactly as before: we consider
how to make the combinations of the estimated levels of activity in these four periods, with the goal of
minimising the MSE of predictions for next year, assuming that next year remains at the same level of

mean activity as the current period. Within this framework we consider a number of diﬀerent ways of
weighting the four periods of activity.
The periods we use are:

• period 4: 1900-1942

• period 3: 1943-1964

• period 2: 1965-1994

• period 1: 1995-2005

The deﬁnitions of these periods are taken from the change-point analysis in Elsner et al. (2000), ﬁgure 2.
It would be interesting to investigate how robust these periods are: however, the point of this article is to
demonstrate how to combine data, given the deﬁnitions of the four periods, rather than to investigate the
deﬁnitions of the periods themselves. We number the periods in reverse chronological order to emphasize
that period 1 is unique in that we are assuming that 2006 will be at the same activity level as period 1.
The rest of this paper is as follows.
In section 2 we present the hurricane data we will use for our
analysis. In section 3 we deﬁne the four period model and derive an expression for the MSE score we use.
In section 4 we discuss how the weights in the model can be calculated. We then move on to applying
various models to the hurricane data in sections 5, 6 and 7. Finally in section 8 we discuss our results.

2 Data

We now describe the hurricane data we will use for this study. The basic data set is HURDAT (Jarvinen et al.,
1984). We extract the number of hurricanes making landfall each year, in each category, counting only
the most intense landfall of storms that make multiple landfalls (this is the SSS variable in HURDAT).
Table 1 shows the number of hurricanes in each of our four periods, for all hurricanes, and for increasingly
intense hurricanes. Table 2 shows the same data, but now for numbers of hurricanes per year.

3 The four period model

In this section we deﬁne the statistical model that represents hurricane activity as having been driven
by four periods of diﬀering underlying mean activity rates. In fact, we will consider the general case of
k periods, and specialize to k = 4 later.
We will be taking an approach in which the historical data is considered as a single realisation of a random
variable. All expectations are then with respect to this random variable. The random variable we use is:

Yi,j ∼ Pois(λi), (i = 1, 2, 3, k; j = 1, ..., ni)
Yi,j represents the hurricane counts during the j′th year of the i′th period. As mentioned above, we
count our periods backwards in time, so that j = 1 corresponds to the most recent period, j = 2 the one
before that, and so on.
Our predictions will be based on averages of the hurricane numbers during these k periods, which we
write as:

(1)

We are trying to predict the hurricane count for next year, on the assumption that the hurricane activity
next year is at the same level as the last few years. We are thus trying to predict the next value in period
1, which we write as Y1,n1+1.
Before considering weighted combinations of the hurricane number averages ˆλi during these four periods,
we ﬁrst consider the two most obvious predictions for Y1,n1+1, which are the average of the hurricane
counts in period 1:

(we often call this the ‘short baseline predictor’)
and the average of the hurricane counts over all four periods:

3.2 The mixed baseline model

We now move on to consider the ‘mixed baseline model’, in which our prediction consists of a weighted
average of the mean hurricane numbers in the k periods, which we write as:

subject to the constraint that the weights add up to 1, i.e.

1,n1+1(α) = α1ˆλ1 + α2ˆλ2 + . . . + αk ˆλk
Y ∗

α1 + α2 + . . . + αk = 1

We now rewrite the prediction in terms of the real unknown levels of activity, plus noise:

3.3 Note on deﬁnition of the model

We have deﬁned our model in terms of weights on averages over periods of years. We could also have
deﬁned it in terms of weights on individual years, with these annual weights being constant in each of
the k periods. Since:

1,n1+1(α) = α1ˆλ1 + α2ˆλ2 + . . . + αk ˆλk

(42)

(43)

(45)

We see that the annual weight on year j in period i is given by αi
ni .
These annual weights give us a useful alternative interpretation of the weights that come out of the model
when applied to real data, as we will see below.



4 Calculating the optimal weights

For the model described above in section 3, how should we estimate the optimal weights? Ideally we
would derive exact expressions for the weights, that extend the expressions given for the k = 2 case
in Jewson et al. (2005). A derivation for exact expressions for the weights, taking into account the
constraint that the weights should sum to one, but not the constraint that the weights should be positive,
is given in appendix 1. However, when we tested the resulting expressions on real data we found that
they gave negative weights, which are not acceptable.
As a simple alternative for the k = 4 case we are interested in, we then resorted to a brute-force search
through all possibilities. If we assume that we only need accuracy to two decimal places then each weight
can only have values from 0.00 to 1.00, which is 101 possibilities. The fourth weight is given by the other
three, and there are thus only 1013 = 1, 030, 301 parameter sets to choose from. We have tested this
method using Fortran on a desktop computer, and completing the search for the weights that give the
lowest RMSE took only a few seconds.
There are other (more eﬃcient) numerical methods that one might consider, especially if k were large,
but brute-force searching turned out to be perfectly adequate for our needs in this particular case.

5 Results for all hurricanes

We now show some results for a number of models applied to the data for all hurricanes, shown in table 3.
Values of bias, standard deviation of errors and RMSE are all calculated using the four level model, to
make them consistent. The RMSE’s are shown as what we call ‘RMSE2’, which is the RMSE on the
prediction of the rate rather than the number of hurricanes (aka the standard error on the rate). The
weights are shown in chronological order, and are shown both as the original weights used in the model
and the annual weights discussed above in section 3.3. The annual weights are multiplied by 106 to make
them easier to understand.

5.0.1 Model 1: Long term baseline

The ﬁrst model we consider is the ‘long term baseline’, which estimates the future rates as an average
of hurricane numbers during the period 1900-2005. This model gives a prediction of 1.72 hurricanes per
year. This prediction has a low standard deviation (of 0.13), because it is based on many years of data,
but has a signiﬁcant bias (of 0.56). The bias arises because of the assumptions in our four period model,
which are that the future will come from the same climate as the last 11 years, and the last 11 years have
seen more hurricanes than the 106 years baseline. The large bias leads to a large RMSE.

5.0.2 Model 2: Short term baseline

The second simple model we consider is the ‘short term baseline’, which estimates the future rates as an
average of hurricane numbers during the period 1995-2005. This model gives a much higher prediction of
future hurricane rates, of 2.27 hurricanes per year. Given our assumptions, this model has no bias. But
it does have a large standard deviation of errors, because of the short period of data used. The resulting
RMSE is lower than for the long term baseline model, but is still rather large (0.45).
The subsequent models are all an attempt to give a better prediction (i.e. a prediction with lower RMSE)
than either of these two very simple models.

5.0.3 Model 3: Optimal combination of the long and short baselines

Our next model considers the optimal combination of the long and short baselines, just as in Jewson et al.
(2005), but now with the weights calculated to minimise the RMSE as given by equation 38 above (i.e.
to minimise the RMSE calculated in the context of the four level model). The optimal weights come out
to be 66% on the recent data and 34% on the earlier data. The annual weights show this to be equivalent
to putting just over 16 times as much weight on the values from the recent years than the earlier years.
The RMSE in this model cannot be worse than the two models that go into it, by deﬁnition. In fact, it
is somewhat better than the short baseline model.
One note: it is important to realise that this model does not assume that there is a 66% chance that the
next year will be at the same level as the last 11 years, and a 34% chance that the next year will revert
to the long term baseline. It assumes that there is a 100% chance that the next year will be at the same
level as the last 11 years. The weighting comes in as a mathematical result of trying to reduce the errors
in our prediction. If one wanted to include some probability of reverting to a lower level in the future,
one would need to do that some other way.

5.0.4 Model 4: Average of the active periods

As mentioned in the introduction, no-one really believes that the period 1900-1994 is uniform and without
ﬂuctuations in the hurricane rate. Model 4 is the ﬁrst to try and take that into account. It does so by
ignoring the two periods with lower rates, and taking a straight average of the two periods with a higher
rate. This model performs well in terms of RMSE, and is the best model so far.

5.0.5 Model 5: Optimal combination of the active periods

However, the earlier active period was not as active as the recent active period, and so perhaps we should
put more weight on the recent period than comes from the straight average of all active years that we
used in model 4. Model 5 tries an optimal combination of the two active periods to capture this. We get
a lower RMSE than model 4, as we must by construction (because we’ve added an extra parameter) and
slightly higher weights on the recent data. The forecast is slightly higher than model 4 because of these
higher weights on the recent (and more active) period.

5.0.6 Model 6: One active period, one inactive period

A potential shortcoming of models 4 and 5 is that they don’t use the whole available data set. We
now attempt ways to use the whole data set, but still resolve the idea that there was an active period
in the middle of the last century. Model 6 does this in the simplest way possible by aggregating the
two less active phases into one period, and the two active phases into another period. It then combines
the average levels across these two aggregated periods with weights that minimise RMSE. The resulting
weights are very interesting: the algorithm that determines the optimal weights actually sets the weights
on the aggregated inactive period to zero, and model 6 thus becomes equivalent to a straight average of
the two active periods. This is telling us that there is not a potential beneﬁt to be had from using the
data from the inactive periods: although using such data would reduce the contribution to the RMSE
from the standard deviation of the errors, it would increase the contribution to the RMSE from the bias
by more.

5.0.7 Model 7: Two active periods, one inactive period

An extension of model 6 above is to distinguish between the rates in the two active periods, but not in
the two inactive periods. As might be expected given the results for model 6, this method again drops
the inactive data from the combination, and thus reverts to model 5.

5.0.8 Model 8: four distinct periods

The most complex model we consider takes four periods at diﬀerent levels and combines them using four
independent weights (subject to the constraints). By deﬁnition this model must give the best RMSE
score, and it does. However, we suspect that the score may not be not statistically signiﬁcantly lower
than the scores from models 5 and 7, and the forecast is very similar. Model 8 gives a zero weight to the
data from period 2, and only a very small weight to the data from the earlier inactive period.

5.1 Discussion

Consideration of these models has yielded the interesting result that the data from the two inactive periods
cannot be used in a very useful way to improve our forecast, because the rates during the inactive periods
are too diﬀerent. The data from the earlier active period, however, can deﬁnitely be used. Our best
model in terms of RMSE (model 8) does put a small weight on the data from the earlier inactive period.
However, the RMSE beneﬁt is very small, and this model has 3 parameters versus only 1 parameter for
model 5. If we did an analysis of whether the beneﬁt from using model 8 over model 5 were statistically
signiﬁcant, we suspect it wouldn’t be.

6 Results for intense hurricanes

The results for intense hurricanes (shown in table 4) are broadly similar, but with some speciﬁc diﬀerences.
We only comment on the diﬀerences.

6.0.1 Model 2: short term baseline

It is interesting to note that the short term baseline model now does worse than the long term baseline
model, which is a reverse of the results for total hurricane numbers. This is because there are fewer cat
3-5 storms, and using only 11 years of data works less well than it does for cat 1-5 storms.

6.0.2 Model 5: optimal combination of the two active periods

The optimal combination of the two active periods is now more or less the same as the straight average.
This is because the optimal combination puts more weight on the earlier period than it does for cat 1-5
hurricanes. This is again because there are fewer cat 3-5 storms, so we need to use more years of data to
estimate them accurately, even if that data is not ideal.

7 Results for basin hurricanes

For future reference, we also include results for basin hurricanes, in tables 5 and 6.

8 Conclusions

We have considered the question of how to combine historical hurricane numbers to make a prediction of
the future. We have made this question mathematically tractable by assuming that the hurricane rates of
the last 106 years were characterized by four periods of diﬀering levels of activity, and that future activity
will continue at the current level. We then look at diﬀerent ways that one might combine estimates of
activity from these four periods.
There are various conclusions we come to. Firstly, using data from the two inactive periods doesn’t add
much, if anything, to our predictions. This is because the levels of activity during the inactive periods
were low relative to the current level of activity. Any potential beneﬁt from using more data is wiped
out by the fact that the data is at the wrong level. Secondly, using data from the earlier inactive period
can deﬁnitely help our predictions. This data is not at exactly the same level as the current period
of high activity, but is suﬃciently close that the bias introduced by using this data is small compared
with the beneﬁcial reduction in variance. Overall, using this data reduces the RMSE of our predictions
considerably.
The biggest ﬂaw in this study is that we don’t have an objective method for choosing the best model
from the 8 models we have considered. The 3 parameter model (model 8) gives the best results (by
construction), but may be overﬁtted relative to simpler models such as model 4 or model 5. Our next
goal is therefore to consider how to select between these models.

A Exact derivation for weights for arbitrary k

We derive exact expressions for the weights as follows. We deﬁne the problem as needing to minimise
a cost function L, given below. This cost function includes a Lagrange multiplier to account for the
constraint that the weights must sum to 1.

"

L =

[(1 − α1)λ1 − α2λ2 − . . . − αkλk]2 +

(46)
We then diﬀerentiate this cost function by the weight vector α and the lagrange multiplier γ, giving a
k + 1 by 1 matrix of derivatives:

∂

∂γ MSE[ ˆY ∗

To ﬁnd the minimum, we set:

In shorthand notation we can write

M × α = c
(55)
where M is a symmetric (k + 1) × (k + 1) matrix of coeﬃcients, α is k + 1 column vector of weights αi
and Lagrange multiplier γ and c is a k + 1 column vector of constants.

A.1 Special cases

The simplest interesting case is when k = 2, which is equivalent to the original model of Jewson et al.
(2005). We now show that the above expressions agree with that model for this special case.

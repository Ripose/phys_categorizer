Abstract

GNSS-R signals contain a coherent and an incoherent component. A new algorithm for
coherent phase altimetry over rough ocean surfaces, called PARFAIT, has been developed and
implemented in Starlab’s STARLIGHT1 GNSS-R software package. In this paper we report
our extraction and analysis of the coherent component of L1 GPS-R signals collected during
the ESTEC Bridge 2 experimental campaign using this technique. The altimetric results have
been compared with a GPS-buoy calibrated tide model with a resulting precision of the order
1 cm.

Introduction

Specular reﬂections dominate medium to
short wavelength electromagnetic
forward
scattering on the ocean, examples of which in-
clude GNSS and solar reﬂections. As reported
in [23], during the last decade many GPS-
R (Global Positioning System Reﬂections) ex-
perimental campaigns have now been success-
fully carried out. A partial and surely incom-
plete list is provided in Table 1. In this paper
we focus on the potential of GNSS-R (Global
Navigation Satellite System Reﬂections) for al-
timetric coastal applications. The techniques
developed, however, can also be implemented
in other scenarios (airborne, spaceborne).

The specularly scattered ﬁeld is composed
of a coherent component and a random, Hoyt-
distributed component [2]. When the surface
is very rough, the latter becomes incoherent
and the former becomes very small. In fact, if
the surface height distribution is normal with
deviation σζ, then

and for code altimetry [27]. Here we present a
new approach for the extraction and analysis
of the coherent component of GNSS reﬂected
signals to perform phase altimetry.

The data discussed here was collected by
ESA/ESTEC during the Bridge-2 experiment.
The experiment aimed at gathering direct and
reﬂected GPS signals from antennas located
about 18 m above the mean sea level of an
Estuary in the North sea of Holland. For
more information on the experimental setup,
the reader is directed to [21].

This paper is structured as follows:

• Discussion on coherence properties of re-
ﬂected signals and their use for phase al-
timetry.

• Analysis of the direct and reﬂected sig-

nals and EM ﬁeld extraction.

• Implementation of PARFAIT altimetry.

• Comparison with other data and discus-

sion of the altimetric results.

where hr2i is the power average, n is the num-
ber of scatterers, λ the EM wavelenght and θ
the local incidence angle [23, 24].

GNSS-R signals thus contain a coherent
and an incoherent component. In companion
papers we discuss the analysis of the incoher-
ent component for sea state monitoring [15, 25]

The importance of retrieving the coher-
ent part of the EM ﬁeld backscattered by the
sea surface stems from its altimetric content.
Measuring the phase of the coherent compo-
nent allows for accurately estimating the delay
of the reﬂected signal with respect to the the
direct one, i.e., for estimation of the temporal

For the reﬂected signal we can write an equiva-
lent expression, modulated by the slowly vary-
ing phasor Ar ·exp(2πiL/λ)+O(t). For coastal
applications we can assume there will be little
ﬁltering of this quantity by the coherent in-
tegration process, as the ocean moves slowly
compared to coherent integration times (a few
ms).

In the case of the direct signal, we can eas-
ily track the carrier phase. To this end, the
delta-phases obtainable from equation (4) can
be accumulated using

= −∆ωdpTE. (5)

This equation holds while ∆ωdp+1 ≈ ∆ωdp.
This is a good approximation, since the time
during which this variation is measured is the
coherent integration time.

The main advantage of using this algo-
rithm for phase tracking is that, due to its dif-
ferencing nature, it allows for easy detection
of the navigation bit π radians phase change.
Figures 2 to 8, which illustrate these con-
cepts, refer to the processing of another set of
GPS-R data—collected during the Casablanca
oil platform Experiment. This Repsol owned
drilling platform is about 40 km oﬀ the coast
of Tarragona, Spain (40o43′4′′N , 1o21′34′′E).
The measurement campaign took place on
March 14th, 2000.

In order to collect the complex EM ﬁeld,
the complex signal
is generated from the
real one. Although this operation is often
performed by the receiver front-end,
in the
Bridge-2 experiment only the in-phase com-
ponent of the signal was sampled at high
frequency and stored on digital tape. The
quadrature component was generated after-
wards. The process is illustrated in Figure (1).
We can then represent the direct signal re-
ceived at the antenna input2 as

Sd(t) = Ad · C(t) · D(t) · ei(ωL1+ωd)t + ηd, (2)

where Ad is the direct signal amplitude, C(t)
represents the C/A code, D(t) the naviga-
tion code, ωL1 the L1 carrier frequency, ωd
the Doppler frequency oﬀset, and ηd (thermal)
noise. The reﬂected signal at low altitudes can
be modelled by

Sr(t) = C(t) · D(t) · ei(ωL1+ωd)t·

+ ηr,

where Ar is the reﬂected signal mean ampli-
tude, O(t) represents the perturbation due to
ocean motion and L the reﬂected signal extra
path length.
In coastal applications O(t) is
a relatively slowly varying quantity with zero
mean, while L, which contains the geophysical
tide signal, can be considered eﬀectively frozen
during correlation processing.

After modulation with a local oscillator of
frequency ωL1−ωIF and low-pass ﬁltering, the
signal will have a residual carrier at ωd + ωIF .
This signal is mixed with a phasor at fre-
quency ωIF + ˜ωd, where ˜ωd is an estimate of
the Doppler frequency for the satellite under
investigation, and ﬁnally low-pass ﬁltered.

In Figure 2, the histogram of the delta-
phases is shown. The x-axis represents cycles
and the y-axis is in arbitrary units. Most δ-
phase values are clearly concentrated around
zero. Other values gather just before ±π.
These values represent in fact small values to
which ±π radians have been added on occur-
rence of a navigation bit transition.

the sea surface is clearly visible in the large
variations present in Figure 4(b) with respect
to Figure 4(a).

plitude magnitude and the complex vector of
the direct and reﬂected ﬁelds, respectively, are

In Figure 8, a simulation of the L1

tion, akin to the one in Figure 6(b), is shown.
The simulation parameters have been chosen
to match the Casablanca experiment sea state.
Those were reported as a “quite calm sea with
a gentle breeze”, with SWH of about 0.7 m as
measured by a nearby buoy.

3. The PARFAIT approach

In general, the altimetric information con-
tent in the PARIS interferometric ﬁeld phase
will be very diﬃcult to use. This is due to
the impact of the incoherent component in the
reﬂected signals. The incoherent component
causes fading and winding.

On the one hand, at a practical level, fad-
ing events will prevent stable phase tracking of
the complex ﬁeld. Even if as in in the Bridge-2
experiment the sea surface is relatively smooth
and fading events are not so frequent, a single
event can severly complicate the use of phase
information if countermeasures are not taken.
In general, however, the reﬂected ﬁeld will fade
very often. As discussed in [21], it is possible
to inject in the system (during a fading event)
a model-based phase to “glue” the phase his-
tory, but this approach will in general necessi-
tate the input of too much model information
into the data in rough sea conditions.

More importantly, as explained in the pre-
vious section, the reﬂected ﬁeld incoherent
component will cause arbitrary winding of the
ﬁeld phasor. This means that the reﬂected
unwrapped phase, unlike the direct one, can-
not be directly used for ranging. Indeed, as we
have shown in previous work [26], the reﬂected
ﬁeld accumulated phase will generally wander
around the complex plane, travelling to dif-
ferent winding number kingdoms, even in the
absence of fadings (see Figure 7). That is to
say, even if a very high SNR system is devised
to get around the problem of ﬁeld fadings, the
interferometric unwrapped phase will not be
directly usable for ranging. Unlike the prob-

lem of fadings, this is a fundamental issue, not
a practical one.

An approach discussed in [26, 19], PIP3,
involves the use of multiple frequencies for the
synthesis of a longer wavelength which will be
more immune to fadings. Here we discuss an-
other approach, PARFAIT4, which is in fact
complementary to PIP.

In the PARFAIT approach, we begin by
noting that although the reﬂected ﬁeld un-
wrapped phase carries no ranging informa-
tion, this need not be a fundamental prob-
lem. What is needed is the coherent geophys-
ical ﬁeld component in the signals, which is
near zero frequency in comparison with the
others—a sort of average ﬁeld. This average
ﬁeld is just the coherent component in the
reﬂected signals after downconversion. With
this in mind, PARFAIT consists of the three
steps described next.

The ﬁrst practical step to extract the co-
herent part is to work with the interferometric
ﬁeld, the ratio for reﬂected versus direct com-
plex ﬁeld. This has the advantadge of error
cancellation, e.g., in Doppler matching of the
incoming signals, and of depending only on the
lapse.

The second step is to “counter-rotate” the
interferometric ﬁeld using an a-priori model of
the reﬂection process.

The third step is ﬁltering the resulting
counter-rotated interometric complex ﬁeld to
ﬁnally extract the coherent phase for esti-
mation of the carrier lapse phase. Counter-
rotation allows for
longer ﬁltering times.
These are fundamental to extract the coherent
component, which decays exponentially with
the square of sea surface standard deviation
(sea state) over eﬀective wavelenght (the wave-
length divided by the sine of satellite eleva-
tion).

Finally, the phase lapse information ob-
tained from the couter-rotated, averaged, com-
plex interfereometric ﬁeld is used for altimetry.

This new approach to PARIS altimetry is
described in more detail in the following sec-
tions. As we discuss, it has proven to be a
very robust and precise processing method.

4. PARFAIT processing of the

Bridge 2 dataset

At low altitudes, simple geometrical con-
siderations lead to the following equation re-
lating the height of the receiver over the re-
ﬂecting surface (considering the same height
for the upward looking antenna and for the
downward looking antenna) with the lapse—
the measured delay measured between the di-
rect and reﬂected GNSS signals:

LP (t) = c∆τP (t) = 2h(t)·sin (ǫP (t))+b, (6)

where LP (t) is the lapse in meters at time t,
c is the speed of light, ∆τP (t) is the tempo-
ral lapse in seconds, h(t) is the height of the
bridge, ǫP (t) is the elevation of the GPS satel-
lite with a speciﬁc PRN number P , and b is
the hardware-induced delay bias, considered
to be a common constant in time. A ﬁrst esti-
mation of the height of the receiver can easily
be performed through a linear ﬁt of the lapse
with respect to the sine of the elevation angle
of each satellite.

In phase processing, the lapse is measured
only up to an integer number of cycles N .
Equation (6) must be rewritten as follows

10 seconds. In other words, in 10 seconds, at
least for one satellite, the coherent interfero-
metric phase changes by more than π
2 radians.
With this ﬁlter length it is not possible to sep-
arate coherent and incoherent components of
the ﬁeld, and fading events are not completely
eliminated. However, a realistic estimation of
the bridge height (and bias) does become pos-
sible.

As mentioned, to extract the coherent com-
ponent a longer averaging period should be
used. To this end, we ﬁrst counter-rotate the
interferometric ﬁeld using a ﬁrst guess of the
bridge height, as we now explain in more de-
tail.

After downconversion and despreading, we
can express the reﬂected complex ﬁeld as a
sum of the coherent and incoherent compo-
nents,

E(t) = Ar eiL(t)/λ + O(t).

(8)

Now consider that we have a ﬁrst guess for the
height and bias parameters, i.e., a model for
the lapse Lm. This model is used to counter-
rotate the ﬁeld:

Ecc(t) = E(t)/Em(t)

(9)

Lc

P (t) = 2h(t) · sin (ǫp (t)) + b + Npλ,

(7)

= Ar e2 i δh(t) sin(ǫp(t))+iδb + O′(t).

with Lc
p (t) is the carrier lapse in meters and λ
is the carrier (L1) wavelength. In other words,
the equation for each satellite contains an ad-
ditional unknown parameter, NP . In order to
use all the satellites for one height estimation,
it becomes necessary to estimate also NP , i.e.
to solve the ambiguity problem.

In order to solve the estimation problem, a
minimization search is carried out for all these
paremeters: h and b (as real constants) and
NP (as integers).

However, as discussed, the interferometric
ﬁeld should be ﬁrst ﬁltered to extract its co-
herent component. Filtering should be long
enough to extract the coherent component but
short enough to keep the geophysical signals of
interest pass through.

This means that the geophysical coherent
component we are after should not change for
more than a small fraction of a cycle during
the time duration of the ﬁlter. The maxi-
mal allowable time thus depends on the ele-
vation angle and rate of change of elevation
of the satellite and, just slightly, on the tide
motion.
In the case of interest, it turns out
the maximum ﬁltering time should be around

Clearly, the phase of the coherent ﬁeld in
equation (9) will now vary much slower than
the phase of the original reﬂected ﬁeld as a
function of the elevation (and therefore time).
This allows for a longer ﬁltering time, and the
exraction of the coherent component of the sig-
nal (recall that O(t) has zero mean).

The equation which relates the countero-
tated phase lapse between direct and reﬂected
signal, the satellite elevations and the δh (i.e.
the error between the ﬁrst guess of the bridge
height and the real value) is

Lc

P (t) = 2 δh (t)·sin (ǫP (t))+δNP λ+δb. (10)

This is the new equation to be used to ﬁt the
lapse versus sine of elevation straight line and
infer the height oﬀset of the bridge and bias
(with respect to the ﬁrst guess used to counter-
rotate the ﬁeld).

In order to solve the ambiguity problem,
a search is performed in the space of the in-
teger n-tuples and the one that produces the
linear ﬁt with smallest residue is selected. It
is important to point out that the n-tuple
search space is drastically reduced by the prior

2003 Workshop on Oceanography with GNSS Reﬂections

ﬁeld counter-rotation. For example,
if the
guess is within ± half meter, the n-tuple sub-
space to be scanned can be limited to those
n-tuples whose components belong to the in-
terval [−3, 3], centered on the ﬁrst guess of the
n-tuple, as obtained from a real (as opposed to
integer) ambiguity resolution.

Another way to reduce the cardinality of
the subspace of the n-tuples to check is to con-
sider that satellites with similar elevation an-
gles cannot have very diﬀerent integer ambi-
guities.

5. Results and comparison

The PARFAIT algorithm described in the
previous section, has been used to analyze the
ﬁrst 10 minutes of the Bridge-2 data, Part A1
and to the ﬁrst 10 minutes of Part A2. The fol-
lowing steps have been performed accordingly
in batches of 2 minutes:

• The EM ﬁelds, direct and reﬂected, have
been computed through the usual corre-
lation process.

• The complex interferometric ﬁeld has
been counter-rotated (Equation (9)).

• The counter-rotated ﬁeld has been ﬁl-

tered using a 30 s window.

• The phase

interferometric,
the
counter-rotated and ﬁltered ﬁeld has
been unwrapped.

of

• For every possible set of values of the
ambiguities NP , a straight line has been
interpolated to the phase histories (one
for each visible satellite) against the el-
evation angle (Equation (10)). The best
ﬁt has been identiﬁed.

The analysis has been carried out for al-
most5 all visible satellites (see Table 2 and Fig-
ure 10). The phase histories are shown in Fig-
ure 11(a). A straight line has been ﬁt through
these phase histories, against the sine of the
satellite elevation angle (Figure 11(b)).

The subspace considered is the one spanned
by all the combination of integers between ±3
around the ﬁrst guess. The result is the n-
tuple [0 0 2 2 4 5] which gives a bridge height
estimation of 18.82 m and an instrumental bias
of −0.45 m.

This procedure has been implemented with
data from the ﬁrst 10 minutes of Part A1 and
A2 of the Bridge-2 experiment. The results
are reported in Table 3 and in Figure 12 for
Part A1 and in Table 4 and in Figure 13 for
Part A2.

Fitting both parts to the tide curve, i.e.
choosing the bias that minimizes the stan-
dard deviation of the data to the available
leads to an altimetry
tide “ground truth”,
bias of 40 cm and a standard deviation of less
than 1 cm. This bias could have an origin in
the ground “truth”, due either to an error in
the determination of the absolute value of the
height of the bridge performed using the GPS
buoy available data (only a few seconds, which
may have caused ambiguity resolution prob-
lems) or, partially, to some anomalies in the
water mass ﬂow in the vicinity of the bridge
structures.

Moreover, considering also that the tide
dynamics measured below the bridge may be
delayed with respect to the place were the tide
was measured, the best ﬁt (over both bias and
delay) is obtained with a delay of 1 minutes
and 37 seconds with respect to the time of the
tide data collection and with a bias of 40 cm.
The standard deviation of the ﬁtted data with
respect to the tide curve is in this case of 0.3
cm.

To summarize,

the proposed approach
to PARIS altimetry, the parfait technique,
leads a very precise estimation of the tide,

• without the need to insert any kind of
model for the phase of the reﬂected sig-
nal during fadings,

• without rejecting too many visible satel-
lites because of their poor SNR and/or
frequent fadings.

This ﬁtted line gives an estimation of the
bridge height of 18.61 m, a hardware bias of
-0.81 m and, as ﬁrst guess for the n-tuple
that solves the ambiguity problem, the val-
ues [0 0 1 1 2 3]. Now, a search in a subset of
I6 is carried out to minimise the residuals of
the ﬁt in the space of the n-tuples of integers.
5Satellites outside the Zeeland Mask [20, 21] are not considered (see also the caption in Figure 10).

Finally, we note that this technique is di-
rectly applicable for PARIS phase processing
from air and spaceborne applications, as long
as a suitable model for the lapse phase can be
constructed. This will be the subject of future
work.

Figure 1: Starting from the in-phase component of the sampled signal, with a carrier frequency equal to the sum
of the IF of the receiver and the Doppler frequency, a complex downconversion is performed. After low-pass
ﬁltering, the two obtained signals bring information about the amplitude of the backscattered EM ﬁeld for both
the in-phase and in-quadrature components—the spread, complex ﬁeld.

Figure 3: The directy signal carrier phase obtained accumulating the δ-phase according to Equation (5). The
stepped plot represents the accumulated phase as it is , i.e. without compensating for the navigation bit half-
cycle variation, which is clearly visible. The lower curve represents the same phase after removal of this eﬀect
(navigation bit correction). The units on the x-axis are milliseconds, and on the y-axis thgy are cycles.

Figure 6: Example of complex ﬁeld time series (phasor dusball, Casablanca Experiment). The units are
correlation coeﬃcient units on both axis. The coherent integration time is 20 ms.

Figure 7: Histogram of the phase for a noiseless simulated ﬁeld. It can be observed that the unwrapped phase
wanders around multiple winding number kingdoms, while tending to spend more time around an average
complex ﬁeld point. This illustrates the fact that the unwrapped phase cannot be used directly for altimetry,
even in the absense of noise.

Figure 10: Each colored arc represents the position of a GPS satellite from the start of the Part A1 of the
experiment to the beginning of Part A2 plus 10 minutes. The green mask represent the area where the GPS
signal reﬂections are supposed to be free of shadowing phenomena due to the bridge structure, and therefore
only the satellite within this mask can be taken into consideration for PARIS processing. The bold parts of the
lines represent the ﬁrst and the second 10 minutes periods.

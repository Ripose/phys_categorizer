Abstract A new scale-dependent dynamic subgrid-scale (SGS) model

based on Kolmogorov’s scaling hypothesis is presented. This SGS model is

utilized in large-eddy simulation of a well-known case study on shear-driven

neutral atmospheric boundary layer ﬂows. The results are compared com-

prehensively with an alternate scale-dependent dynamic SGS model based

on the popular Smagorinsky closure. Our results show that, in the context

of this particular problem, the scale-dependent dynamic modeling approach

is extremely useful, and reproduces several establised results (e.g., the sur-

face layer similarity theory) with ﬁdelity. Results from both the SGS base

models are generally in close agreement, although we ﬁnd a consistent su-

periority of the Smagorinsky-based SGS model for predicting the inertial

range scaling of spectra.

1 Introduction

The dynamic subgrid-scale (SGS) modeling approach of Germano et al. [1]

has been quite successful in large-eddy simulations (LESs) of various engi-

neering ﬂows [2]. In this approach, one dynamically computes the values of

the unknown SGS coeﬃcients at every time and position in the ﬂow. By

looking at the dynamics of the ﬂow at two diﬀerent resolved scales, and as-

suming scale similarity as well as scale invariance of the SGS coeﬃcients, one

can optimize their values. Thus, the dynamic modeling approach avoids the

need for a priori speciﬁcation and tuning of the SGS coeﬃcients. A recent

Scale-dependent dynamic SGS models for LES of NBL

study [3] based on extensive database analysis further suggests that the dy-

namic modeling approach closely reproduces the minimal simulation error

strategy (termed as optimal reﬁnement strategy), which is highly desirable

in turbulence modeling.

In atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) turbulence, where shear and strat-

iﬁcation and associated ﬂow anisotropies are (almost) ubiquitous, the inher-

ent scale-invariance assumption of the original dynamic modeling approach

breaks down. Port´e-Agel et al. [4] relaxed this assumption and introduced

a scale-dependent dynamic modeling approach in which the SGS coeﬃ-

cients are assumed to vary as powers of the LES ﬁlter width (∆f ). The

unknown power-law exponents, and subsequently the SGS coeﬃcients, can

be determined in a self-consistent manner by ﬁltering at three levels [4,5].

In the simulations of neutral boundary layers (NBLs), the scale-dependent

dynamic SGS model was found to exhibit appropriate dissipation behavior

and more accurate spectra in comparison to the original (scale-invariant)

dynamic model [4,5]. Recently the scale-dependent dynamic modeling ap-

proach was modiﬁed and extended by incorporating a localized averaging

technique in order to simulate intermittent, patchy turbulence in the sta-

bly stratiﬁed ﬂows [6,7]. In parallel, scale-dependent dynamic SGS models

based on Lagrangian averaging over ﬂuid ﬂow path lines were developed

by Bou-zeid et al. [8] and Stoll and Port´e-Agel [9] to simulate neutrally

stratiﬁed ﬂows over heterogeneous surfaces.

4

Anderson et al.

The scale-dependent dynamic modeling approach and its variants so far

always used the popular eddy-viscosity formulation of Smagorinsky [10] as

the SGS base model. However, this SGS model assumes that the energy dis-

sipation rate equals the SGS energy production rate. In order to avoid this

strong assumption, Wong and Lilly [11] proposed a new SGS model based on

Kolmogorov’s scaling hypothesis. A dynamic version of the Wong-Lilly SGS

model to some extent outperformed the dynamic Smagorinsky model in sim-

ulations of the buoyancy-driven Rayleigh-B´enard convection [11]. Further-

more, the dynamic Wong-Lilly SGS model is computationally inexpensive

in comparison to the dynamic Smagorinsky SGS model. The combination

of lesser assumptions and cheaper computational cost certainly make the

Wong-Lilly model an attractive SGS base model for LES. Therefore it is of

interest to explore if the Wong-Lilly SGS model or its variants are capa-

ble of simulating diﬀerent ﬂow regimes of the ABL. It is generally agreed

upon that in comparison to buoyancy-driven ﬂows, large-eddy simulations

of shear-driven boundary layer ﬂows are far more challenging. Thus, in the

present study, we focus on neutrally buoyant shear-driven ABL ﬂow. In

order to realistically account for the near-wall shear eﬀects, we ﬁrst formu-

late a locally averaged scale-dependent dynamic version of the Wong-Lilly

SGS model (henceforth LASDD-WL, see Appendix for details). Then, we

comprehensively compare its performance with the locally averaged scale-

dependent dynamic Smagorinsky (hereafter LASDD-SM) SGS model earlier

developed by Basu and Port´e-Agel [6].

The structure of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we brieﬂy provide

the technical details of a case study. Extensive comparisons (in terms of the

similarity theory, spectra, and ﬂow visualizations) between the LASDD-WL

and LASDD-SM SGS models are performed in Section 3. Finally, concluding

remarks are made in Section 4.

2 Description of Simulations

In this work, we perform large-eddy simulations of a turbulent Ekman layer

(i.e., pure shear ﬂow with a neutrally stratiﬁed environment in a rotating

system) utilizing the LASDD-SM [6,7] and LASDD-WL (see Appendix)

SGS models. Both these simulations are identical in terms of initial con-

ditions, forcings, and numerical speciﬁcations (e.g., time integration, grid

spacing). Technical details of our LES code and the LASDD-SM SGS mod-

eling approach have been described in detail in [6] and will not be repeated

here for brevity.

The selected case study is similar to that of the LES intercomparison

study by Andr´en et al. [12]. The simulated boundary layer is driven by an

imposed geostrophic wind of (Ug, Vg) = (10, 0) ms−1. The Coriolis parame-

ter is equal to fc = 10−4 s−1, corresponding to latitude 45◦ N. The compu-

tational domain size is: Lx = Ly = 4000 m and Lz = 1500 m. This domain

is divided into Nx × Ny × Nz = 40 × 40 × 40 nodes (i.e., ∆x = ∆y = 100

m, and ∆z = 38.5 m). The motivation behind the selection of this coarse

grid-resolution is two-fold. Primarily it allows us to perform a direct compar-

6

Anderson et al.

ison with the results from [12], which used almost the same grid-resolutions.

More importantly, coarse grid-resolution enables us to identify the strengths

and/or weaknesses of diﬀerent SGS models, as well as, to underscore their

impacts on large-eddy simulations. The simulations are run for a period of

10 × f −1

c

(i.e., 100,000 s), with time steps of 2 s. The last 3 × f −1

interval

c

is used to compute statistics. A passive scalar is introduced in the ﬂows by

imposing a constant ﬂux (wc0) of 10−3 kg m−2 s−1 at the surface. The lower

boundary condition is based on the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory with

a surface roughness length of z◦ = 0.1 m.

3 Results and Discussions

In this section, we report the results of the LASDD-SM and LASDD-WL

SGS models-based simulations and compare them with results from the in-

tercomparison study [12], wherever possible. This particular case (without

the inclusion of passive scalars) was also simulated by Kosovi´c [13] using a

nonlinear SGS model, and recently by Chow et al. [14], who utilized a so-

phisticated hybrid SGS model. Our simulations show that both the LASDD

SGS models perform very well, and the results are comparable to the past

studies.

Temporal evolution of the surface friction velocity (u∗) is very similar in

both the simulations (not shown). The average value of u∗ during the last

3 × f −1

c

interval is approximately 0.44 ms−1 in the case of the LASDD-SM

model. The LASDD-WL model produces a marginally higher value (0.454

ms−1). The corresponding values found in [12] are: 0.425 ms−1 (Moeng),

0.448 ms−1 (Mason - backscatter), 0.402 ms−1 (Mason - non-backscatter),

0.402 ms−1 (Nieuwstadt), and 0.425 ms−1 (Schumann).

In Figure 1, we present the nonstationary parameters Cu and Cv (see

[12] for deﬁnitions). Under steady state conditions, these parameters should

approach unity. Although none of the past [12,14] and present simulations

are quite close to steady state conditions, they are more or less in phase

with each other. All these simulations clearly portray the inertial oscillation

of period 2π/fc, as anticipated.

Accurately simulating the non-dimensional velocity gradient (φM ), and

the scalar gradient (φC ) in the neutrally stratiﬁed surface layer has proven

to be a very challenging task for many atmospheric LES models. It is well

known that the traditional Smagorinsky model is over-dissipative in the

near-surface region and gives rise to excessive mean gradients in velocity

8

Anderson et al.

and scalar ﬁelds (cf. [12]). Fortunately, state-of-the-art LES-SGS modeling

approaches of Mason and Thomson [15], Sullivan et al. [16], Kosovi´c [13],

Port´e-Agel et al. [4], Port´e-Agel [5], Esau [17], Chow et al. [14], Bou-zeid

et al. [8], and Stoll and Port´e-Agel [9] oﬀer major improvements over tradi-

tional Smagorinsky-type SGS models, and reproduce the non-dimensional

gradients reasonably well. From Figure 2, it is clear that both the LASDD-

SM and LASDD-WL SGS models behave satisfactorily, albeit, the perfor-

mance of the LASDD-WL SGS model is superior. We would like to stress

that both the LASDD SGS modeling approaches do not require any addi-

tional stochastic term or supplementary near-wall stress models for reliable

performance in an LES. In the framework of Monin-Obukhov similarity the-

ory, the non-dimensional velocity gradient (φM ) is indisputably equal to one

(the dotted line in Figure 2 - left). However, in the literature there is no

consensus on the ‘true’ magnitude of the non-dimensional scalar gradient

(φC ). Businger et al. [18], based on the Kansas ﬁeld experiment, proposed

a value of 0.74. Recent ﬁeld observations, however, suggest values close to

0.9 (for a review, see [19]). From the present coarse-resolution simulations,

it is diﬃcult to favor either of these values. However, qualitatively, both the

LASDD SGS models portray very similar non-dimensional scalar gradient

proﬁles (Figure 2 - right).

In neutrally stratiﬁed ABL ﬂows, the observed peak normalized velocity

variances occur near the surface and are of the magnitude: σ2

v/u2
σ2

∗ ∼ 3 − 4, and σ2

scale (= −wc0/u∗). In [12], it was found that the consensus among dif-

ferent SGS models is poorer in the case of passive scalar in comparison

to the momentum case. The disagreements between diﬀerent SGS models

could be partially attributed to diﬀerent a priori prescriptions for the SGS

Prandtl (P rSGS) number, and underscore the need for the determination

of P rSGS in a self-consistent manner, as is done in the present study. One

must also acknowledge the facts that the passive scalars exhibit complex

spatio-temporal structure, and the statistical and dynamical properties of

passive scalars are remarkably diﬀerent from the underlying velocity ﬁelds

[22,23].

We point out that the individual plots in Figure 3 represent both the

normalized resolved and total (resolved + SGS) variances. In the LASDD

modeling approach, one does not solve additional prognostic equations for

the SGS turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) and the SGS scalar variances.

However, the SGS variances can be roughly diagnosed using the approach

of Mason [24].

Scale-dependent dynamic SGS models for LES of NBL

The one-dimensional longitudinal velocity and passive scalar spectra

are computed at heights z = 0.1zi, and z = 0.5zi, and presented in Fig-

ure 4. The spectra highlight the most important diﬀerence between the

LASDD-SM and LASDD-WL SGS models: the LASDD-WL SGS model

seems to be over-dissipative (indicated by steeper spectral slopes at higher

wavenumbers). In the case of the LASDD-SM model, the longitudinal veloc-

−5/3
ity and scalar spectra clearly show extended inertial range (k
1

scaling)

at z = 0.5zi . Near the surface (z = 0.1zi), the longitudinal velocity spec-

tra show the anticipated production range (k

−1
1 ), as well as a short inertial

range. Recent research suggests that the production range is (likely) related

to elongated streaky velocity structures (see below). Traditional SGS models

typically do not reproduce well deﬁned inertial ranges in coarse-resolution

simulations (cf. [12]). From that perspective, the performance of the LASDD

models could be considered a near success. We note that the original plane-

averaged [4] and the Lagrangian-averaged [8,9] scale-dependent dynamic

SGS models also reproduced the characteristics of the one-dimensional lon-

gitudinal velocity spectra remarkably well. However, near the surface, the

passive scalar spectra predicted by these SGS models showed unphysical

pile up of scalar variances [5,9]. This was possibly due to small dynamically

determined eddy-diﬀusion coeﬃcients near the surface [5,9]. In the present

study we did not encounter this issue.

A few previous LES studies have reported the existence of elongated

streaky structures in the neutral surface layers [13,16,25,26,27,28]. The

link between experimentally observed long production range (k−1 scaling)

in the streamwise spectra of the longitudinal velocity and the elongated

streaky structures has recently been discussed in depth by Carlotti [28].

Moreover, strong correlations between these streaky structures and large

negative momentum ﬂux were earlier reported by [26]. From Figure 5 (top),

it is clear that both the LASDD models show streaky structures, roughly

parallel to the mean wind direction, in the surface layer (at z = 0.1zi).

However, signiﬁcant morphologic diﬀerences are noticeable in the mid-ABL

Scale-dependent dynamic SGS models for LES of NBL

ﬂow structures. In accordance with past studies (cf. [26]), the LASDD-

SM SGS model predicts non-coherent structures at z = 0.5zi. In contrast,

large coherent structures persist in the LASDD-WL model results (Figure 5,

bottom-right). Another interesting feature of this plot is the (virtual) non-

existence of ﬁne-scale ﬂow structures. This can be directly associated with

the over-dissipative nature of the LASDD-WL SGS model, as discussed be-

fore. In essence, we can infer that the (non-)existence of coherent structures

in NBL ﬂows are strongly dependent on SGS parameterizations, especially

for coarse-resolution simulations. A few previous studies somewhat support

this inference. For instance, the nonlinear SGS model [13], and the mod-

iﬁed Smagorinsky SGS model [27] barely produced any elongated streaky

structures.

4 Concluding Remarks

Two locally averaged scale-dependent dynamic SGS closures – the LASDD-

SM [6,7] and the LASDD-WL (this study) – have been used to simulate a

neutral ABL case. Although the theoretical foundations of these SGS mod-

els are fundamentally diﬀerent, results presented in Figures 1 through 5

illustrate strong congruence between their results, and with ﬁrmly estab-

lished results (i.e. the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory and the inertial

range scaling of spectra). The normalized variances computed in our simu-

lations also closely follow the ones calculated from ﬁeld measurements. The

major noticeable and consistent diﬀerence between the results is shown in

Figure 4: the LASDD-WL SGS model appears to be over-dissipative at the

higher wavenumbers, in comparison to the LASDD-SM SGS model. In Fig-

ure 5, we see that both SGS models predict elongated streaky structures

in the near-wall region (z = 0.1zi). These coherent structures are no longer

evident at higher locations in the domain, in the case of the LASDD-SM

SGS model-based simulation. Due to undue dissipation, the LASDD-WL

SGS model-based simulation results in quite diﬀerent ﬂow structures at

this level.

The Wong-Lilly SGS base model requires fewer assumptions and comes

at slightly less computational cost in comparison to the commonly used

Smagorinsky SGS base model. Unfortunately, these advantages seem to be

oﬀset by its over-dissipative tendency at higher wavenumbers. Some inher-

ent assumptions of the Smagorinsky base model can also be eliminated by

solving a prognostic equation for the TKE. However, when using this TKE

SGS approach, the SGS model coeﬃcients are often tuned for diﬀerent ABL

ﬂow conditions [16,29]. An alternative approach would be to formulate a

dynamic version of the TKE SGS model, which will also account for en-

ergy backscatter. We are currently working on this SGS approach to better

represent the physics of atmospheric boundary layer ﬂows.

Scale-dependent dynamic SGS models for LES of NBL

17

In the context of the present study, the angular brackets h· · ·i denote localized

spatial averaging on horizontal planes with a stencil of three by three grid points

Recent studies have shown that the assumption of scale invariance is seriously

ﬂawed for sheared and stratiﬁed boundary layer ﬂows [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. In other words,

the ratio of (CW L)α∆f

to (CW L)∆f

should not be assumed equal to one for

most of these ABL ﬂow scenarios. Rather, this scale-dependence ratio should

be determined dynamically. In order to implement the scale-dependent dynamic

procedure, one needs to employ a second test ﬁltering operation at a scale of α2∆f

[denoted by

(· · ·)]. Invoking the Germano identity for the second time leads to:

Following [4], the following scale-dependence assumption can be made:

β =

(CW L)α∆f
(CW L)∆f

=

(CW L)α2∆f
(CW L)α∆f

,

(A7)

(A8)

This is a much weaker assumption than the scale-invariance modeling assumption

of β = 1. Now, from Equations (A5) and (A7), using Equation (A8), one solves

for the unknown parameter β, which in turn is used to compute the Wong-Lilly

SGS model coeﬃcient, (CW L)∆f

, utilizing Equation (A5).

Solving for β essentially involves ﬁnding the roots of a ﬁfth-order polynomial

number of calculations (speciﬁcally the tensor multiplications) undoubtedly lead

to cheaper computational costs.

Scale-dependent formulation for scalars can be derived in a similar manner

[5]. The Wong-Lilly model for a generic scalar (c) could be written as:

qi = −

CW L
P rSGS

∆4/3
f

∂˜c
∂xi

(A10)

where P rSGS is the so-called SGS Prandtl number. In the dynamic or scale-

dependent dynamic modeling approaches, typically the lumped SGS coeﬃcient

(CW LP r−1

SGS) is determined in a self-consistent manner. This procedure not only

eliminates the need for any ad hoc assumption about the SGS Prandtl number

(P rSGS), it also completely decouples the SGS scalar ﬂux estimation from SGS

stress computation. In the scale-dependent approach [5], one further deﬁnes a

scale-dependent parameter for scalars (βc), analogous to Equation (A8). For the

Wong-Lilly SGS base model, it could be written as:

βc =

Abstract

A striking correlation has recently been observed between global cloud cover and
the ﬂux of incident cosmic rays. The eﬀect of natural variations in the cosmic ray
ﬂux is large, causing estimated changes in the Earth’s energy radiation balance that
are comparable to those attributed to greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil
fuels since the Industrial Revolution. However a direct link between cosmic rays
and cloud formation has not been unambiguously established. We therefore pro-
pose to experimentally measure cloud (water droplet) formation under controlled
conditions in a test beam at CERN with a CLOUD chamber, duplicating the condi-
tions prevailing in the troposphere. These data, which have never been previously
obtained, will allow a detailed understanding of the possible eﬀects of cosmic rays
on clouds and conﬁrm, or otherwise, a direct link between cosmic rays, global cloud
cover and the Earth’s climate. The measurements will, in turn, allow more reliable
calculations to be made of the residual eﬀect on global temperatures of the burning
of fossil fuels, an issue of profound importance to society. Furthermore, light radio-
isotope records indicate a correlation has existed between global climate and the
cosmic ray ﬂux extending back over the present inter-glacial and perhaps earlier.
This suggests it may eventually become possible to make long-term (10–1,000 year)
predictions of changes in the Earth’s climate, provided a deeper understanding can
be achieved of the “geomagnetic climate” of the Sun and Earth that modulates the
cosmic-ray ﬂux.

1 Introduction

Global warming is a major concern of the world, with its potentially devastating eﬀects
on coastal settlements and world agriculture. The steep rise in greenhouse gas emissions
since the Industrial Revolution has increased the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere
by 30% (Fig. 1). This is widely believed to be the dominant cause of the observed rise of
about 0.6◦C in the global mean surface temperature during this period (Fig. 2) [1].

A small systematic rise or fall in the global temperature is caused by a net imbalance
(“forcing”) in the Earth’s energy radiation budget (Fig. 3). The radiative forcing caused
by the increase in the CO2 fraction since 1750 is estimated to be 1.5 Wm−2 [1], compared
with the global average incoming solar radiation of 342 Wm−2, i.e. an imbalance of
only 0.4%. After including the eﬀects of all greenhouse gases (+2.45 Wm−2), aerosols1
(-0.5 Wm−2) and their eﬀects on clouds (-0.75 Wm−2), the present net radiative forcing
from mankind is estimated to be 1.2 Wm−2.

The climate models [1] upon which the predictions of greenhouse warming depend
have gradually improved as new eﬀects and better data have been incorporated. They
now provide a reasonable representation of the observed variation in global temperature
over the last century (Fig. 2). However they remain subject to signiﬁcant uncertainties,
both from unknown processes and also from the unknown eﬀects of feedback mechanisms
which may amplify or damp a warming trend. Important unknown eﬀects include those
due to increased evaporation of water (which may cool due to an increased cloudiness
or warm due to an increased greenhouse eﬀect), shifts in the amount of CO2 dissolved
in the oceans, changes in the ocean currents and changes in the polar ice. Given the
uncertainties in these models, many scientists consider there is no convincing evidence at
present to demonstrate that a greenhouse warming of the planet is in progress, let alone
that the models can reliably predict future temperature changes (the predicted rise by
the end of the next century is 1.3–2.5◦C; Fig. 4).

Nonetheless it is in this climate of scientiﬁc uncertainty that major political decisions
on greenhouse gas emissions are presently being made (Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro,
1992, and UN Climate Convention in Kyoto, 1997) that will have a profound eﬀect on
the economic development of both the developed and the developing countries. The need
for such political decisions to be based on sound scientiﬁc grounds is self evident, and a
major world-wide research eﬀort on climate change is underway.

An unexpected and important factor in climate change has recently been discovered:
cloud cover seems to follow natural variations in the incident cosmic ray ﬂux [2, 3]. How-
ever a direct link between cosmic rays and cloud formation has not been unambiguously
established and, moreover, the microphysical mechanism is poorly understood. This
presents particle physics with a unique opportunity to make a major contribution to
the problem of global warming by conﬁrming, or otherwise, this link under controlled
conditions in a test beam. The purpose of this paper is to provide an initial outline of the
motivation and conceptual design of the proposed CLOUD (Cosmics Leaving OUtdoor
Droplets) detector.

1Aerosols are 0.001–1 µm diameter particles of liquid or solid in suspension. Atmospheric aerosols
include dust, sea salt, soot (elemental carbon), organic compounds from biomass burning, sulphates
(especially (NH4)2SO4) from SO2, and nitrates from NO and NO2. Aerosol concentrations vary from a
few per cm3 in clean maritime air to 106 cm−3 in highly-polluted city air.

The data are based on Antarctica ice core records and, since 1958, on direct measurements
from Mauna Loa, Hawaii. Also shown are the estimated yearly emissions of CO2 from
burning fossil fuels since the Industrial Revolution.

2 The origins of climate change

The Earth’s climate has not always been the same; signiﬁcant changes have occurred dur-
ing recorded history and even greater changes have taken place since the human ancestral
line began about 5 million years ago. The urgent questions facing science are why these
natural changes took place and whether there is currently an inﬂuence of mankind on
the climate. Only when the natural causes are understood and properly accounted for in
climate models can we expect meaningful results on the anthropogenic inﬂuences.

Several natural eﬀects are well established. These include the Milankovitch cycles—
variations in the Earth’s orbit, tilt and spin with respect to the Sun—which seem to
control the timing of glacials and interglacials. These cold and warm phases correspond
to cycles of about 100,000 years and 10,000 years, respectively. (We are presently ap-
proaching the end of an interglacial; sometime in the next 1000 years or so the climate
will probably become much colder.) Other important natural sources of climate change
are the anomalous warm Paciﬁc current known as El Ni˜no, and volcanoes that pour ash
into the stratosphere, reducing the radiation from the Sun reaching the Earth’s surface. A
recent volcanic example is Mt. Pinatubo in the Philippines, which erupted in June 1991
and caused a global cooling, by up to 0.4◦C, over a period of about 3 years. In contrast,
a natural eﬀect that has until recently been harder to understand is the apparent link
between solar activity—the sunspot2 cycle—and the weather.

2Sunspots are areas of the Sun’s photosphere where strong local magnetic ﬁelds (typically 2500 gauss,
to be compared with the Earth’s ﬁeld of about 0.3 gauss) emerge vertically [4]. They appear dark because
their temperature is about half of the surrounding photosphere (3,000 K compared with 5,800 K). They
are thought to be generated by the diﬀerent rotation rates of regions of the Sun: one revolution takes
25 days at the equator and 28 days at mid-latitudes. This modiﬁes the normal convective motions of the
plasma and creates “knots” of strong magnetic ﬁeld which penetrate the photosphere and provide escape
paths for the plasma, forming sunspots.

gases alone, b) greenhouse gases and aerosols, and c) greenhouse gases, aerosols and an
estimate of changes in solar irradiance. The broken curves are the model predictions un-
der several diﬀerent assumptions of the climate sensitivity, ∆T2×, which is the change in
global mean temperature for a doubling of the atmospheric CO2.

2.1 Activity of the Sun

The observation that warm weather seems to coincide with high sunspot counts and cool
weather with low sunspot counts was made as long ago as two hundred years by the
astronomer William Herschel who noticed that the price of wheat in England was lower
when there were many sunspots, and higher when there were few. The most well-known
example of this eﬀect is known as the Maunder Minimum [5], the Little Ice Age between
1645 and 1715—which ironically almost exactly coincides with the reign of Louis XIV,
le Roi Soleil, 1643–1715—during which time there was an almost complete absence of
sunspots (Fig. 5a). During this period the River Thames in London regularly froze
across and fairs complete with swings, sideshows and food stalls were a standard winter
feature.

Quantitative proof of a correlation between the Sun’s activity and the Earth’s temper-
ature was presented by Friis-Christensen and Lassen [6] in 1991. They used the sunspot

cycle length as a measure of the Sun’s activity. The cycle length averages 11 years but
has varied from 7 to 17 years (Fig. 5), with shorter cycle lengths corresponding to a more
magnetically-active Sun. A remarkably close agreement was found between the sunspot
cycle length and the change in land temperature of the Northern Hemisphere in the period
between 1861 and 1989 (Fig. 6). The land temperature of the Northern Hemisphere was
used to avoid the lag by several years of air temperatures over the oceans, due to their
large heat capacity. This ﬁgure covers the period during which greenhouse gas emissions
are presumed to have caused a global warming of about 0.6◦C. Two features are of par-
ticular note: ﬁrstly the dip between 1945 and 1970, which cannot be explained by the
steadily rising greenhouse gas emissions but seems well-matched to a decrease in the Sun’s
activity, and secondly the close correspondence between the two curves over this entire
period, which would seem to leave little room for an additional greenhouse gas eﬀect.

In the absence of suﬃciently sensitive measurements, people suspected that the Sun’s
irradiance may be ﬂuctuating over the solar cycle. However, from our knowledge of how
the Sun produces energy, this would seem diﬃcult. Radiation from the Sun was created in
the core and, in a random walk with a mean free path of about 10 cm, has taken about ﬁfty
million years to reach the surface. This would smooth out any substantial ﬂuctuations
in radiated energy on a timescale signiﬁcantly less than about a million years. Indeed
the steadiness of the Sun’s irradiance over a complete sunspot cycle has recently been
conﬁrmed by satellite measurements (Fig. 7 [7]). The solar ﬂux is slightly higher at
sunspot maximum; although sunspots are cooler and have reduced emission, this is more
than compensated by an associated increase in bright areas known as plages and faculae.
The mean irradiance changes by about 0.1 % from sunspot maximum to minimum which,
if representative over a longer time interval, is too small (0.3 Wm−2, globally-averaged)
to account for the observed changes in the Earth’s temperature.

occurred during 1980 and 1990, and sunspot minima occurred during 1985–86 and 1996.
The rapid ﬂuctuations at the maxima are due to sunspots rotating into the ﬁeld of view.
The data are from the Active Cavity Irradiance Monitor (ACRIM I and II) and from the

experiments.

2.2 The missing link: cosmic rays?

Experimental observations.
It has been recognised for several decades that the cos-
mic ray ﬂux reaching the Earth is strongly modulated by the solar wind3 which, in turn,
is strongly inﬂuenced by the sunspot cycle (Fig. 8). At times of high sunspot activity, the
solar wind is stronger and this partially shields the lower-energy galactic cosmic radiation
from penetrating the inner solar system and reaching the Earth. In addition, the lower-
energy cosmic rays are aﬀected by the geomagnetic ﬁeld, which they must penetrate to
reach the top of the atmosphere. The minimum vertical momentum of primary charged
particles at the geomagnetic equator is about 15 GeV/c, decreasing to below 0.1 GeV/c
at the geomagnetic poles. The modulation of the cosmic ray ﬂux incident on the Earth’s
atmosphere at the higher geomagnetic latitudes is as large as 50% between sunspot max-
ima and minima [8]. It represents one of the largest measurable eﬀects of sunspot activity
near the Earth’s surface.

But how could cosmic rays aﬀect the Earth’s weather? The breakthrough was made by
3The solar wind is a continuous outward ﬂow of charged particles (mainly protons and electrons, with
5% helium nuclei) from the plasma of the Sun’s corona. The main sources are near the Sun’s poles; other
important sources include coronal holes and sunspots. The solar wind creates the huge heliosphere of
the Sun that extends out to Neptune and beyond. At the Earth’s orbit the solar wind has a velocity
of 300–800 km s−1 (β = 0.001–0.003) and an intensity of (0.5–5)
108 particles cm−2 s−1, generating a
10−5 Gauss.

Monitor Stations at Climax, Colorado (3400 m elevation; 3 GeV primary charged particle
cutoﬀ), Huancayo, Peru (3400 m; 13 GeV cutoﬀ) and Haleakala, Hawaii (3030 m; 13 GeV
cutoﬀ). The stronger modulation of the cosmic ray ﬂux at higher latitudes (Climax) is
due to the lower primary cutoﬀ energy.

smoothed using a 12-month running mean.

Svensmark and Friis-Christensen in 1997 [2, 3] who showed a striking correlation between
global cloud cover and the incident cosmic ray ﬂux (Fig. 9). Moreover, the cloud cover
was found to have a poorer correlation with variations in the solar microwave ﬂux (Fig. 9).
The latter is known to follow closely variations in the total solar irradiance, soft X-rays
and ultraviolet rays. The modulation in cloud cover was found to be more pronounced at
higher geomagnetic latitudes, consistent with the reduced shielding eﬀect of the Earth’s
magnetic ﬁeld at higher latitudes (see Fig. 8).

Over a sunspot cycle, the absolute variation in global cloud cover is about 3% (equiv-
alent to 4.8% relative fraction), and the variation in the neutron ﬂux is about 15–20%
(for a primary charged particle cutoﬀ of 3 GeV). The neutrons are mostly produced by
primary hadronic interactions in the ﬁrst 1–2 λint of the atmosphere and therefore mea-
sure the changes in cosmic ray intensity at altitudes above about 13 km. The primary
cosmic radiation is about 80% protons, 15% He nuclei and 5% heavier nuclei. At sea level
the most numerous charged particles are muons and their ﬂuctuation is less pronounced,
about 3% over a solar cycle [8], since they are produced from a stiﬀer primary spectrum
of cosmic radiation, which is therefore less aﬀected by the solar wind.

Fraction of clouds aﬀected by cosmic rays. These data suggest that cosmic ra-
diation is, under suitable atmospheric conditions, either extending cloud lifetimes (for
example, by increasing the droplet number density) or inducing some additional cloud
formation. The currently-accepted physical processes that aﬀect the production of cloud
condensation nuclei [9, 10], including both aerosols and ice particles, do not consider ion-
induced eﬀects. The new satellite observations suggest that the ions or radicals produced
in the atmosphere by cosmic rays may somehow be aﬀecting the nucleation, growth or
activation of atmospheric aerosols, or the creation of ice particles.

It is interesting to estimate the total cloud fraction that may be caused by cosmic
rays. It is not yet known at which altitude the cosmic radiation may be aﬀecting clouds,
i.e. whether the clouds more closely follow the amplitude modulation of the neutron ﬂux
(20%) or of the muon ﬂux (3%). However, making the most conservative assumption, a
20% change in cosmic ray ﬂux causes a 4.8% relative change in cloud cover. If the cloud-
forming process is directly proportional to cosmic ﬂux then this suggests about 25% of the
Earth’s clouds could be aﬀected by cosmic rays. However, if the process is proportional
to ion density then the fraction is twice as large, since a 20% increase in cosmic ray ﬂux
leads to a 10% increase in equilibrium ion density (see Section 3.2). In summary, a large
fraction of the Earth’s clouds could be aﬀected by cosmic radiation.

Eﬀect on the Earth’s radiation budget. Thin clouds at high and middle altitudes
cause a net warming due to an increased trapping of outgoing longwave radiation whereas
optically thick clouds produce a net cooling due to a dominant increase in the albedo (re-
ﬂection) of the incoming shortwave solar radiation. At present there is no indication which
clouds may be aﬀected by cosmic rays, so we will assume for the present estimate that
all are aﬀected equally. Present estimates from the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment
(ERBE) indicate, overall, that clouds reﬂect more energy than they trap, leading to a net
cooling of 28 Wm−2 from the mean global cloud cover of 63% (Table 1 [11]). The 4.8%
relative variation in cloud cover due to variations of the cosmic ray ﬂux over a solar cycle
therefore implies a change in the Earth’s radiation budget of 1.3 Wm−2 (0.4% of the total

9

incident solar radiation). This is a signiﬁcant eﬀect: in the 3-year period 1987–1990, the
eﬀect of the reduction in cosmic ray ﬂux was comparable to the total estimated radiative
forcing of 1.5 Wm−2 from the increase in CO2 concentration since 1750.

Table 1: Global annual mean forcing due to various types of clouds, from the Earth
Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) [11]. The sign is deﬁned so that positive forcing
increases the net radiation budget of the Earth and leads to a warming; negative forcing
decreases the net radiation and causes a cooling.

Open questions. Despite the observation of Svensmark and Friis-Christensen (Fig. 9),
a direct link between cosmic rays and cloud formation has not been unambiguously es-
tablished. The satellite data are a composite of several datasets which are subject to
inter-calibration uncertainties. Furthermore the data are spatially and temporally selec-
tive - they are restricted to oceans and exclude the tropics and polar regions, and they
are largely daytime only.

It has been argued that the single sunspot cycle for which there are reliable satellite
measurements is insuﬃcient to demonstrate a clear connection and that several more
cycles (each of course requiring 11 years) are needed. Even if this extended study were
to conﬁrm the correlation between the sunspot cycle and cloud cover, it may not prove
the missing link is cosmic rays. While cosmic rays certainly vary with the sunspot cycle,
other factors that change during the cycle may be aﬀecting clouds, quite independently
of cosmic rays. For example, the cause may be variations of the solar ultra-violet (UV)
radiation. Although the total irradiance of the Sun varies by only 0.1 % over the solar
cycle, the variation is more pronounced in the UV. Wavelengths below 320 nm, which
account for only about 2% of the total solar irradiance, vary by about 5% (200–320
nm) to 50% (100–150 nm), or even more at shorter wavelengths [15]. The UV radiation
is absorbed by ozone high in the stratosphere which warms as a result. This has the
potential to inﬂuence large scale tropospheric dynamics and hence, perhaps, cloudiness.
Finally, the evidence of increased variations in cloud production at higher latitudes,
while consistent with the cosmic ray explanation, could simply be due to the variations
with latitude of temperature, air circulation, aerosols and other atmospheric conditions
that aﬀect cloud formation.

2.3 History of cosmic rays and climate change

If the periodic 11-year cycles of the sunspots and the associated cosmic ray ﬂux were the
end of the story, then it would be of limited concern since there would be no resultant
long-term change in the Earth’s weather but simply another cyclic “seasonal” change
(albeit with a period of 11 years). However there is clear evidence of longer-term and
unexplained changes both in the Sun and in the Earth’s magnetosphere and these, in
turn, seem to have had long-term eﬀects on the Earth’s climate.

2.3.1 Global warming during the present century

Over the course of this century the cosmic ray ﬂux has been steadily decreasing; it is
weaker today at its maximum during the sunspot cycle than it was at its minimum
around 1900. This has been revealed by analysis of the 10Be concentration in a Greenland
ice core (Fig. 10 [12]). Beryllium-10 is produced in the atmosphere by cosmic rays and,
10−2
despite a lower production rate than 14C (Section 2.3.2) by about a factor 100 (3.5
×
atoms cm−2s−1), it has the advantages of settling out relatively rapidly (
2 years) and
106 years. A systematic decrease in the cosmic ray ﬂux of the
of a long half-life, 1.51
magnitude indicated by the 10Be data would have caused a reduction in cloud cover and
consequent warming of the Earth, suﬃcient to account for a large part of the observed
rise of 0.6◦C in global temperatures over this century which is presently attributed to
anthropogenic greenhouse gases.

×

∼

The cause of this systematic decrease of the cosmic ﬂux has been a strengthening
of the solar wind over this century. This is revealed in measurements of the so-called
aa geomagnetic index of short-term (up to 3-hour) variations in the geomagnetic ﬁeld
at the Earth’s surface [13, 14], which is aﬀected by the interactions of the solar wind
with the Earth’s magnetosphere (Fig. 11). With this hindsight, the previous observation
by Friis-Christensen and Lassen that the sunspot cycle length is closely correlated with
global temperatures (Fig. 6) can now perhaps be understood: the sunspot cycle length is
a direct measure of the strength of the solar wind and a better measure than the sunspot
number itself. Shorter sunspot cycles correspond to a stronger solar wind and therefore
to decreased cosmic ﬂux, decreased cloud cover and increased temperatures.

Although a comparison of global temperatures with direct measurements of cosmic
rays can only be made since 1937, when systematic measurements of charged cosmic rays
began with electronic detectors, the two are indeed found to correlate well (Fig. 12 [3]).

2.3.2 Climatic change over the past millennium

The observations of a correlation between the Sun’s activity, cosmic rays and the Earth’s
climate may be extended to earlier times with 14C data. This isotope is continuously
formed in the atmosphere by low energy neutrons from cosmic radiation at a rate of

recirculation from the oceans has a smoothing eﬀect such that changes in the 14C fraction
on timescales less than a few decades are smoothed out. Plant material originally contains
the prevailing atmospheric fraction of 14C and subsequently, since the material is not
recycled into the atmosphere, the fraction decreases with the characteristic half life of
14C.

By analysing the 14C content in the rings of long-lived trees such the Californian
bristlecone pine, a year-by-year record has been assembled of the cosmic ray ﬂux on
Earth over the past several thousand years. The data for the last 1000 years are shown
in Fig. 13 [5]. (In this the following two ﬁgures, the vertical axis is oriented so that
warmer temperatures point upwards.) It is interesting to note that the periods where
the 14C deviation exceeds 10 parts per mil correspond to recorded climatic anomalies:
a) 1100–1250, the so-called Medieval Warm period, b) 1300–1360, the Wolf maximum,
c) 1460–1550, the Sp¨orer minimum, and d) 1645–1715, the Maunder minimum. The warm
period that lasted until about 1400 enabled the Vikings to colonise Greenland and wine
to be made from grapes grown in England. It was followed by a period of about 400 years
during which the glaciers advanced and cooler, harsher conditions prevailed in most parts
of the world.

The Maunder Minimum, when there was an almost complete absence of sunspots,
would have corresponded to a high cosmic ray ﬂux on Earth and therefore an increased
cloudiness. This provides a consistent explanation for the exceptionally cold weather of
this period. Indeed, in every case the excess (c–d) or lack (a–b) of 14C is consistent with
the observation of a higher cosmic ray ﬂux leading to more clouds and cooler temperatures,
and vice versa.

ring analyses for the last millennium [16]. The data points (dots and open circles) are two
independent high-precision measurements. The solid line represents a combined ﬁt to a
large number of other measurements of medium precision. Periods where the deviation
of the data points exceeds 10 parts per mil are indicated. The ﬁrst four coincide with
recorded climatic anomalies. The sharp negative 14C deviation during the present century
is the Suess eﬀect, due to the burning of 14C-depleted fossil fuels.

These data provide evidence for signiﬁcant temperature anomalies over the last millen-
nium that coincided with variations of the cosmic ray intensity. Furthermore they show
that the Earth has experienced several extended warm and cold spells over the last 1000
years—with climate swings comparable to the current “anomaly”—whose origin certainly
cannot be due to anthropogenic greenhouse gases. Whatever caused those earlier spells
could well be at work today.

2.3.3 Climatic change since before the last ice age

The 14C record has been extended even earlier; the last 10,000 years is shown in Fig. 14
[17] and the last 30,000 years in Fig. 15 [18]). There are several important conclusions
to be drawn from these data. Firstly, there have been very large systematic changes
in the cosmic ray ﬂux over this period, namely about 40% (where a systematic shift of
only 1% is known to be associated with a signiﬁcant climate change, as seen in Fig. 13).
Secondly, the ending of the last great ice age, 17,000–10,000 years ago, coincided with
a sharp decrease of the 14C fraction (Fig. 15). Part of this is due to the reduction in
ice cover and the higher temperatures, thereby increasing the circulation of 14C-depleted

(Su) are indicated. The data points show the Earth’s magnetic dipole moment over the
same period (right-hand scale) [16].

CO2 from the oceans. An estimated decrease in the atmospheric 14C fraction from these
eﬀects is 10% [16]. The measured change (Fig. 15) is substantially larger, suggesting that
this period may have coincided with a decrease of the cosmic ﬂux.

These large changes in the cosmic ray ﬂux have been caused by changes in the Earth’s
magnetic ﬁeld4 and its associated shielding eﬀect. The geomagnetic ﬁeld is independently
measured and found to closely track the cosmic ray ﬂux, as shown in Figs. 14 and
15. This record of changes in the cosmic ray ﬂux, and the expected eﬀects on global
climate, correlate with the climate records derived from analyses of cores drilled in the
Greenland ice sheet. However it is important to keep in mind that, even if cosmic rays can
indeed aﬀect cloud formation, it would also require the existence of suitable atmospheric
conditions (humidity, aerosol content, etc.) and that these were probably quite diﬀerent
during the glacials.

Finally, on an even longer timescale, it is known that the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld reverses
periodically (approximately every million years). During these reversals—which may take
place fairly rapidly over periods of less than 1000 years—the Earth’s ﬁeld diminishes to
zero and then re-establishes itself with the opposite polarity. At such times the Earth will
be subjected to far higher cosmic ray ﬂuxes and the temperatures will be greatly reduced.
This may perhaps be a factor contributing to the extinction of the dinosaurs 65 million
years ago, which coincided with a geomagnetic reversal.

2.4 Conclusions

In summary, there are two main conclusions to be drawn on the connection between cosmic
rays and climate change. Firstly, the pattern of systematic change in the global climate
over the past several thousand years follows the observed changes in the cosmic ray ﬂux
over the same period; and it is consistent with the explanation that a high cosmic ray ﬂux
corresponds to more clouds and a cooler climate, and vice versa. Furthermore, the rise of
about 0.6◦C in global temperatures over the last 100 years is consistent in magnitude and
time dependence with the observed changes in cosmic ray ﬂux—and thereby cloud cover—
over the same period. A clear and compelling case exists for further study of the eﬀect of
cosmic rays on cloud formation and climate change—especially in order to improve model
calculations of the residual eﬀects due to greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil fuels.
Secondly, since the cosmic ray ﬂux is controlled both by the Sun’s magnetic activity
(solar wind) and by the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld, it may eventually be possible to make
long-term (10–1,000 year) predictions of changes in the Earth’s climate by detailed mea-
surements and a deeper understanding of the “magnetic climate” of the Sun and Earth
and its eﬀect on the cosmic ray ﬂux. In this regard, it will be necessary to understand how
the Sun changes its magnetic activity and to understand the progression of the Earth’s
magnetic moment. Perhaps even the longer-term Milankovitch cycles are partly inﬂuenc-
ing the global climate through geomagnetic eﬀects; the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld is due to
electric currents ﬂowing in the liquid core and in the magnetosphere, and these may have
been inﬂuenced by the periodic gravitational motions of the Milankovitch cycles.

4The Earth’s ﬁeld is presently weakening (Fig. 14), which may indicate a cooling period ahead.

3 Cloud formation by charged particles

Cloud droplets in the troposphere5 form on suitable aerosols above about 100 nm size
known as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) [9, 10]. The new satellite observations suggest
that the ions or radicals produced in the atmosphere by cosmic rays may somehow be
aﬀecting the nucleation, growth or activation of atmospheric aerosols, or aﬀecting the
creation of ice particles. An increase of CCN concentration could lead to increased droplet
number concentration, smaller droplet size, less precipitation and therefore longer cloud
lifetime. If cosmic rays can aﬀect ice nuclei then this would also potentially have a strong
inﬂuence on clouds since the freezing of supercooled water droplets reduces their vapour
pressure and allows their growth at the expense of neighbouring liquid droplets.

A microphysical explanation of cloud formation in the presence of ionising radiation
is presently lacking. In fact there has been very little research on this mechanism and
present studies do not consider it [10]. Some experiments with highly charged droplets
(10−14–10−11 C) have, however, shown that they are 10–100 times more eﬃcient at cap-
turing aerosols than uncharged droplets [19].

3.1 Droplet formation in a conventional cloud chamber

Certain aspects of how droplets are induced by ionising radiation are known from the
development of cloud chambers, but these largely concern high supersaturations of water
vapour and rapid growth rates. The principle of operation of a cloud chamber [20] can be
understood from Fig. 16 which shows the water vapour pressure equilibrium curves for
small droplets:

where p is the vapour pressure, p0 the saturated vapour pressure at a plane water surface,
R the gas constant, T the absolute temperature, γ the surface tension, M the molecular
weight, ρ the density, ǫ0 the permittivity of free space and r the radius of the droplet.
The curves divide an upper region of vapour pressure in which water droplets grow by
condensation (e.g. droplet D1) from a lower region where they shrink by evaporation (e.g.
If a droplet carries an electric charge Qe then its vapour pressure is reduced by

increased attraction of the polar water molecules. The growth region is therefore larger
(Fig. 16a) and, in particular, for supersaturations above about 5, all charged droplets
will grow and reach visible size (e.g. D3). The actual starting point for a droplet is not
known. However, to set the minimum scale we can estimate the volume occupied by a
single water molecule as 4
NA , where NA is Avogadro’s constant. This indicates
the eﬀective radius of one water molecule is r
0.2 nm; and a droplet of radius 0.5 nm
contains about 15 molecules.

5The troposphere is the lowest level of the atmosphere and the region where there is enough water
vapour and vertical mixing for clouds to form under suitable conditions. The depth of the troposphere is
about 6–8 km at the poles, extending to about 17 km over the equatorial regions; it contains about 75%
of the mass of the atmosphere. There is an overall adiabatic lapse rate of temperature in the troposphere
by between 6◦C (moist air) and 10◦C (dry air) per km altitude, reaching a minimum of about -60◦C
at the boundary with the stratosphere (the tropopause). The stratosphere, which extends up to about
50 km, has a temperature that slowly rises with altitude. This leads to very little turbulence and vertical
mixing and, in consequence, it contains warm dry air that is largely free of clouds.

The curves of Fig. 16a) indicate how the presence of a small charge facilitates droplet
formation and growth at high supersaturations, above about 2. The maximum supersat-
urations in the troposphere are typically less than one per cent above unity which, if this
were the only mechanism involved, would require large droplet charges for stable growth,
as indicated in Fig. 16b). Therefore if ionising radiation is indeed inducing additional
cloud formation, it must be somehow aﬀecting the aerosols or ice nuclei that eﬃciently
seed clouds in the atmosphere.

Ions and droplets in the atmosphere

To provide input for the design requirements of the CLOUD detector, it is useful to esti-
mate some characteristics of cosmic-ray ionisation and water droplets in the troposphere.
Some representative parameters at the upper and lower boundaries of the troposphere are
summarised in Table 2. These regions are well below the ionosphere—which starts above
the stratosphere at about 80 km altitude—where atoms and molecules are readily ionised
by solar UV and X-ray photons.

In order to be sensitive to long growth times in CLOUD, the droplets must not be
removed by gravitational fall before observation. This sets a maximum droplet size for
studying long growth times, which can be estimated as follows. Stoke’s formula for the

Very small droplets will be suspended by Brownian motion. We can estimate their
maximum size as follows. The projected Brownian displacement is σx = √2Dt, where
D = µkT , and k is the Boltzmann constant. The mobility is µ = vdrif t/F = 1/(6πηr)
(from equation 2), where F is the force causing the drift. Substituting gives the rms pro-
jected displacement of a droplet due to Brownian motion, σx =
(kT t)/(3πηr). Brownian
motion will dominate over gravitational fall when the projected Brownian displacement
is about equal to the droplet radius r in the time the droplet would have taken to fall a
distance r. This indicates that Brownian displacement is comparable to gravitational dis-
placement at a droplet radius of about 0.7 µm, and below this value droplets will remain
suspended for extended periods.

In summary, in order to allow for the possibility of long formation times in the atmo-
sphere, the CLOUD detector should have the capability to observe droplet growth over
periods of up to about 10 min, i.e. comparable to the ion lifetime, and the dimensions of
the chamber should allow for a ﬁducial volume that is approximately 10 cm away from any

4 The CLOUD experiment

The basic purpose of the CLOUD detector (Fig. 17) is to conﬁrm, or otherwise, a di-
rect link between cosmic rays and cloud formation by measuring droplet formation in a
controlled test-beam environment. The CLOUD detector is essentially a cloud chamber
that is designed to duplicate the gases, water vapour, aerosols and temperature/pressure
conditions found in the Earth’s troposphere.

Since the microphysical mechanisms responsible for cloud formation by cosmic rays
are poorly understood, it is necessary for the experimental tests to cover a broad range
of variables and conditions. For instance, it is not yet even known at which altitude
(i.e.
temperature and pressure conditions) the clouds are being formed. Also, since
the maximum water vapour supersaturation in the troposphere is only about one per
cent, droplet growth times may be quite long, as discussed in the previous section. The
combined eﬀects of ionisation and aerosols/ice particles is probably important (Section 3).
The ionisation of existing water droplets by charged particles requires study; charged
droplets have a lower vapour pressure and will therefore grow at the expense of uncharged
droplets. It is important to measure the sensitivity to a range of track ionisation densities,
dE/dx, and ion pair concentrations that duplicates those of cosmic rays. This indicates
the need for beam particles ranging from protons to heavy ions. Finally, an investigation
should be made of the possibility that droplets are formed in relatively “rare events”, such
as very highly charged ions or droplets, perhaps due to heavy nuclei.

Cloud chamber data under these conditions have never been previously obtained.
Although C.T.R. Wilson’s cloud chamber7 was extensively developed in the ﬁrst half
of this century, it was optimised for experimental particle physics and operated under
conditions far removed from those of the troposphere.

4.1 Detector

The CLOUD detector (Fig. 17) comprises the following main components:

•

A temperature-controlled cloud chamber that can be operated in the temperature
range -60◦C to 30◦C and at pressures from a vacuum to 1.5 atm. The upper pressure
limit is to allow for adiabatic expansions down to a ﬁnal pressure of 1 atm. An
electrode structure (ﬁeld cage) in the cloud chamber provides a simple clearing ﬁeld
for measurements with low residual ionisation.

7It is interesting to note that C.T.R. Wilson had the inspiration for the cloud chamber while observing
meteorological phenomena on the mountain of Ben Nevis in 1894. (The phenomena were not particle
tracks, however, but “coronas” around the Sun and glories, where the Sun glows around shadows in the
mist.)

temperature conditions for the cloud chamber. A temperature stability of about

by about 0.05%. The investigation of long growth times for the droplets requires
that the operating conditions be held steady for long periods. The temperature is
adjusted by heat-exchange coils immersed in a suitable liquid coolant in the bath and
connected to a He compressor. The temperature of the circulating He is controlled

A scintillation counter hodoscope to measure the incident beam. The beam must
be spread over a large area to simulate the quasi-uniform cosmic radiation.

2. Understanding of the microphysical processes involved in cloud formation by
ionising radiation. This will involve Monte Carlo simulation of the processes and a
comparison with the CLOUD results.

3. Estimation of the global cloud cover due to cosmic rays, using atmospheric

data recorded by satellite experiments.

5 Conclusions

The observation of an apparent connection between cosmic rays and global climate oﬀers
a unique opportunity for particle physics to make a major contribution to the problem
of global warming—at a relatively modest cost. The proposed CLOUD experiment will
unambiguously conﬁrm, or otherwise, a direct link between cosmic radiation and cloud
formation, and allow a quantitative understanding of the physical processes involved.
This, in turn, would provide an unambiguous and physically explicable connection be-
tween solar and climatic variability—representing a great advance in the understanding
of the relationship between the Earth and its star.

Although this experiment primarily addresses atmospheric science, it is clearly in the
domain of particle physics and of CERN’s expertise and experimental facilities. The
CLOUD experiment will have the immediate impact of potentially resolving one of the
important unknown eﬀects that may have so far prevented reliable calculations of global
warming from greenhouse gases—an issue of profound economic and social importance to
the world. Furthermore, if the link is conﬁrmed, then it may eventually become possible
to make long-term predictions of systematic changes in the Earth’s climate, by monitoring
and predicting the evolution of the cosmic ray ﬂux and the “geomagnetic climate” of the
Sun and Earth that modulates its intensity.

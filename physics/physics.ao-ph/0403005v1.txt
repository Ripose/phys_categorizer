Modeling turbulent wave-front phase as a

fractional Brownian motion: a new approach.

Dar´ıo G. P´erez, Luciano Zunino and Mario Garavaglia

Centro de Investigaciones ´Opticas (CIOp),

CC. 124 Correo Central, La Plata 1900, Argentina.

This paper introduces a general and new formalism to model the turbulent

wave-front phase using fractional Brownian motion processes. Moreover, it

extends results to non-Kolmogorov turbulence. In particular, generalized

expressions for the Strehl ratio and the angle-of-arrival variance are obtained.

These are dependent on the dynamic state of the turbulence.

INTRODUCTION

Earth turbulent atmosphere introduces spatial and temporal variations in wave-front

that lead to image degradation of optical systems. Astronomical telescopes, laser beam

projection systems, and optical communication systems are limited by the presence

of turbulence. In particular, the resolution of a ground-based telescope is notably

modiﬁed. Generally, the telescope aperture is assumed to be smaller than the outer

scale of the turbulence, so spatial frequencies of the turbulence with wavelength of the

order of the aperture diameter, D, impart a random tilt on the incident wave-front.

1

This wave-front tilt translates to simple image motion at the image plane. It is the

dominant atmospheric aberration across the telescope pupil. Statistical characteriza-

tion of the image motion is of paramount importance because of its implications on

the design of adaptive optics systems.

In order to characterize temporally and spatially the statistics of the wave-front

phase ϕ several sensing methods have been used.1 They use single,2 double,3, 4 and

multiple5, 6 (Shack-Hartmann) aperture sensors to measure the wave-front tilt. The

centroid of the long-exposure images formed by each aperture is directly proportional

to the slope of the wave-front across it.

As usual, the phase structure function is

where r0 is the Fried parameter9 linked to the spatial statistical properties of the

refractive index, and C 2

ϕ is the phase structure constant, roughly near to 6.88.

Interferometric measurements have corroborated the expression in Eq. (2). Many

of these measurements have been made under the conditions mentioned above. But,

∗The structure function is a basic characteristic of random ﬁelds with stationary increments. It

is appropriate to analyze the temporal and spatial structure of locally homogeneous and isotropic

random ﬁelds—see Ref. [7, pp. 9–10 and 19–20].

signiﬁcant departures from the 5/3 exponent have been experimentaly observed.2, 5, 6, 10, 11

In particular, for near to the ground measurements, exponents in the range (1, 5/3]

have been determined experimentally. It is well-known that atmospheric turbulence

is not always in its fully developed state, thus deviations from this simple model

are likely—non-Kolmogorov turbulence. The phase structure function can then be

generalized6, 12 to include these results as follows,

spectrum and the structure function of phase ﬂuctuations. If a Kolmogorov spectrum

is chosen: β = 11/3, C 2

6.88 and r0,β = r0; thus, we recover Eq. (2).

In order to model turbulence-degraded wave-fronts by Kolmogorov turbulence,

Schwartz et al. 13 have suggested that these are fractal surfaces described by a frac-

tional Brownian motion (fBm) process with Hurst parameter 5/6 and a fractal di-

mension equal to 13/6. Fractal properties are attributed to both the spatial and

temporal behavior, and they are directly related through the Taylor hypothesis, or

frozen turbulence approximation. The value of the Hurst parameter is in accord with

the predictability of real stellar wave-front slopes.14 Moreover, several algorithms for

adaptive optics have been designed based on this statistical prediction.13–15 In partic-

ular, McGaughey & Aitken16 have suggested that the source of predictability stems

from the low-pass spatial ﬁltering done by the wavefront sensor. These authors have

modeled the temporal behavior of wavefront slopes by ﬁltering the increments of a

3

fBm with Hurst parameter equal to 5/6.

On the other hand, several authors have simulated Kolmogorov phase ﬂuctuations

over a ﬁnite aperture by using the random midpoint displacement algorithm.17, 18 This

is also an algorithm for generating fractional Brownian motion surfaces—see Ref. [19,

pp. 487–490 and 497–499]. Moreover, the fBm model was used as an alternative

stochastic process to model the turbulent refractive index in lightwave propagation.20

In this paper the turbulent wave-front phase is modeled as a fBm. The result of

Schwartz et al. is extended to include non-Kolmogorov turbulence. In Sec. 2 the gen-

eral formalism for fBm processes is presented. This formalism is applied to determine

the Strehl ratio in Sec. 3.A and the angle-of-arrival variance in Sec. 3.B. The latter

result is compared against the well-known and widely used variance ﬁrst obtained by

Tatarsk˘ı.

2. FRACTIONAL BROWNIAN MOTION AND ITS ASSOCIATED NOISE

Usually, natural phenomena behaving randomly are labeled as noises. These noises are

characterized through the estimation of their power spectrum,

(ν).21–23 Empirically,

W

an enourmously wide range of these spectra have been observed to follow power-laws

proportional to

−β, for some exponent β. Better known as 1/f β-type noises†; they

ν

|

|

are classiﬁed according to the value of the exponent, e. g. Ref. [22, ch. 3].

Since its ﬁrst formalizations in the earlies 1900’s (independently modeled by L.

Bachelier and A. Einstein) the Brownian motion caught the attention of physicists.

It is the most common representative of 1/f 2-type noises; thenceforth, processes with

†In this paper instead of the usual frequency f , ν = 2πf is used for self-consistence.

4

such spectra are known as brown noises. On the other hand, the derivative of the

Brownian motion is called white noise. The fact that it only can been deﬁned as a

distribution (in some probability space) is found in its tail-divergent power spectral

distribution, i. e. β = 0. Afterwards, any process between these two, with power

exponent 0 < β < 2, is referred as a pink noise. The last category is for those

processes with 2 < β < 3, they are considered black noises.

A (stochastic) process X(t) is self-similar with index H if, for any c > 0,

X(t) d= cH X(c−1t);

(4)

that is, both processes are equal in distribution. The coloured noises are self-similar,

with exponent H = (β

1)/2, as the generalized Fourier transform of their spectra

−

can show.24 Also, it suggests the presence of a slowing decaying auto-correlation, and

thus of memory.

Nevertheless, this colour classiﬁcation is rather rough. It is insuﬃcient the knowl-

edge of the power spectra to create stochastic processes modeling the randomness of

quantities observed in real world. As these random quantities tend to appear in dy-

namics equations other properties are needed to give them sense, e. g.: bimanual

rhythmic coordination diﬀerential equation,21 Black-Scholes market equation,25 ray-

optics equation,26 etc..

Because of all the ‘good’ properties it endows, stationarity is desired. It is said a

processes X is (wide sense) stationary if

and Cov(X(t + τ ), X(t)) = Cov(X(τ ), X(0)),

Unfortunately, self-similar processes are non-stationary: Var X(t)

t2H

= const..

∝

Since we have lost ergodicity, the Wiener-Khinchin theorem fails. On the other hand,

the existence of stationary increments does not contradicts the self-similar property.

A process with stationary increments is such that the probability law of its increments

X(t + τ )

X(t) is independent of t.

−

Natural phenomena exhibit in general a non-gaussian behavior. Nevertheless, it

is usual to embed these with a gaussian distribution since, in this way, they become

analytically tractable, Ref. [22, p. 35]. Moreover, choosing this distribution leaves un-

aﬀected the memory properties described by the spectrum. That path will be followed

here.

There is only one family of processes which are self-similar, with stationary incre-

ments, and gaussian: the fractional Brownian motion (fBm).27 The normalized family

of these gaussian processes, BH, is the one with28

power exponent H is the Hurst parameter and its range is bounded. While the con-

dition H > 0 guarantees their (mean-square) continuity, H < 1 avoids degeneracy.24

Another more intuitive argument can be drawn. It is well-known these curves have

fractal dimension equal to 2

H.29 Because they are embedded in the plane, H > 0.

−

6

On the other hand, continuous parameterized curves should have dimension greater

than one, and thus H < 1.

These processes exhibit memory, as can be observed from Eq. (5), for any Hurst

paremeter but H = 1/2. In this case successive Brownian motion increments are

as likely to have the same sign as the opposite, and thus there is no correlation.

Otherwise, it is the Brownian motion that splits the family of fBm processes in two.

When H > 1/2 the correlations of successive increments decay hyperbolically, and

this sub-family of processes have long-memory. Besides, consecutive increments tend

to have the same sign, these processes are persistent. For H < 1/2, the correlations

of the increments also decay but exponentially, and this sub-family presents short-

memory. But since consecutive increments are more likely to have opposite signs, it

is said that these are anti-persitent.

Fractional Brownian motions are continuous but non-diﬀerentiable processes (in

the usual sense), and only give spectra exponents between 1 and 3. Nevertheless, fBm

processes can be generalized to allow derivatives. A simple dimensional inspection

suggests that the latter should have spectral exponent equal to β = 2H

1; thus,

1 < β < 1.

Formally, continous processes are not called noises since they can be integrated

pathwise. That is, given any continuous process X(t) the integral

exists for any realization of the integrands. On the other hand, noises are not pathwise

is not the limit of area approximating sums for any realization, i. e., there is no

calculus in the classical sense.

The ﬁrst construction of a Stochastic Calculus was made by Itˆo around 1940

for Brownian motions. Later, these results were extended to more general processes—

semi-martingales30 and inﬁnite dimensional Wiener (Brownian) processes.31 The White

Noise Analysis due to Hida, focused in the white noise rather than the Brownian mo-

tion as a fundamental entity, is of particular interest here.

Like common sense suggests the lack of conventional derivatives should be over-

come through distributions. This is the basic idea underlying the white noise calculus.

The problem is thus to embed these distributions into the right probability space. Let

φ be an element of the Schwartz space

(R) (the space of rapidly decreasing smooth

S

real-valued functions), and ω is any element of the dual

∗(R). Therefore, the white

noise is deﬁned as the bilinear map W such that, W (φ) =

In the last decade diﬀerent approaches have been given to extend the stochastic

calculus to fBm. The range of persistent processes have been particularly fruitful,33–36

not only because of its applications in practical problems also for its regularity prop-

erties. Duncan et al. 37 successfully extended the white noise calculus to this range by

means of a tool termed Wick product. These ideas were recently picked up by Elliott

and van der Hoek25 who have given a complete calculus for all values of the Hurst

parameter. A brief outlook based on their work is given in Appendix A.

3. WAVE-FRONT MODELING AND APPLICATIONS

Let ϕ be the phase diﬀerence between the average and perturbed wave-front. As it

was argued at the introduction, it is a realization of a fractal surface. Moreover, the

small perturbation and near-ﬁeld approximations guarantee structures functions like

Eqs. (2) or (3). That is, it has stationary increments. Now, as always, it is assumed

that the process ϕ is gaussian—see for example Ref. [8, p. 293]. Its power spectrum is

also observed to follow a power law; thus, it is self-similar. At least it is valid within

the inertial range, which is limited by two characteristic scales—the outer and inner

scales, L0 and l0 respectively.

Now, let

˜BH(ρ) := BH (

) = BH (ρ)

ρ

k

k

(6)

be the isotropic fractional Brownian motion (ifBm). It is gaussian, self-similar and,

under condition (B.3) (given at the Appendix B), has stationary increments. There-

1, which guarantees

this process has stationary increments—see Appendix B. As it was stated earlier at the

introduction, the structure function power exponent is restricted to the range (1, 5/3]

for near to the ground measurements. Therefore, the Hurst exponent is conﬁned to

1/2 < H

5/6.

A. Strehl ratio

The Strehl ratio, S, is used as a ﬁgure of merit in order to characterize the qual-

ity of beam propagation and the performance of a telescope. It is deﬁned as the

ratio between the central irradiance of the aberrated point spread function and the

diﬀraction-limited point spread function‡.

B. Angle-of-arrival variance

erage plane is simply

(12)

(i = 1, 2). Following classical arguments, Ref. [8, pp. 334-336], the angle-of-arrival

variance is given by

Wϕ(ν) is the power spectrum of ϕ(ρ). It should be stressed that in this ex-
pression it is applied the Wiener-Khinchin theorem; thence, the phase is modeled as

a stationary random variable.

A divergent integral is obtained under the assumptions of Kolmogorov turbulence,

small perturbation and near ﬁeld approximation. In order to make it summable Rod-

dier introduces a high and low frequency cut-oﬀs, D−1 and L−1

respectively. It is a

are involved. That is,

where the proportionality coeﬃcient is in radians squared units. However, coeﬃcients

ranging from 0.342,41, 42 0.358,3, 4 to 0.36543 have been given. It should be noted that

these coeﬃcients were obtained by using just only phase diﬀerences, so it is necessary

that the wave-front remains unchanged over the whole aperture. Then, the pupil size

must be smaller than the inner scale of the atmospheric turbulence, i. e. D < l0.

Now, according to Eqs. (7) and (11), we have that

z(ρ) = Cz ˜BH

this paper are above the inner scale: in particular, D > l0. Then, the diﬀerence

between these variances is plausible.

As we have seen, the removal of high frequencies is due to the ﬁnite size of the

aperture.44 In fact, since many scales are involved this ﬁltering must be introduced

in order to smooth out. Let us properly introduce this eﬀect.

4. CONCLUSIONS

This paper introduces a stochastic process, the ifBm, to model the turbulent wave-

front phase. Not only it gives the right structure function for non-Kolmogorov turbu-

lence, but also adds well-known statistic properties of the wave-front phase. Moreover,

our model allows to extend results for two relevant optical quantities: the Strehl ratio

and the angle-of-arrival variance. The expressions for these quantities depend on the

Hurst parameter, thus on the dynamic state of the turbulence.11 Remember that this

parameter is related to the site location where the measurements are made.

In particular, the expression obtained for the angle-of-arrival variance when H =

5/6, Eq.(21), is almost identical to the classical one found by Tatarsk˘ı when high

16

frequencies are ﬁltered out. Nonetheless, for a Hurst parameter diﬀerent from the

one above a dependence with the wavelength appears. Up to now, it is unclear for

us if such dependence exists for non-Kolmogorov turbulence. That is, if the Fried

parameter is independent or not from the Hurst parameter.

Using the formalism presented here a wider range of power spectra can be studied.

Such as multi-fractal processes where the power exponent changes across frequency

ranges.

Also, asymmetric power spectra gives rise to self-aﬃne surfaces; the phase ϕ is

scaled diﬀerently depending on chosen axis. Thus, two Hurst parameters can control

this behavior, and this formalism is applicable again.

Finally, since phase distortions of a wave-front transform into amplitude distor-

tions in the wave cross sections, a similar analysis should be possible for the amplitude.

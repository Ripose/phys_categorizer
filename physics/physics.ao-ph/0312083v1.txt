(Received 11 December 2003)

The purpose of this paper is to present a multilayer primitive equations model for ocean
dynamics in which the velocity and buoyancy ﬁelds within each layer are not only allowed
to vary arbitrarily with horizontal position and time, but also with depth—linearly at
most. The model is a generalization of Ripa’s inhomogeneous one-layer model to an
arbitrary number of layers. Unlike models with homogeneous layers, the present model is
able to represent thermodynamics processes. Unlike models with slab layers, i.e. those in
which the layer velocity and buoyancy ﬁelds are depth-independent, the present model
can represent explicitly the thermal-wind balance within each layer which dominates at
low frequency. In the absence of external forcing and dissipation, energy, volume, mass,
and buoyancy variance constrain the dynamics; conservation of total zonal momentum
requires in addition the usual zonal symmetry of the topography and horizontal domain.
The model further possesses a singular Hamiltonian structure. Unlike the single-layer
counterpart, however, no steady solution has been possible to prove formally (or Arnold)
stable using the above invariants. It is shown here that a model with only two layers
provides an excellent representation of the exact gravest baroclinic mode phase speed.
This suggests that conﬁgurations with only a small number of layers will be needed to
tackle a large variety of problems with enough realism.

1. Introduction

Approximate inhomogeneous layer primitive equations models in which the velocity
and buoyancy ﬁelds are allowed to vary only in the horizontal position and time (Dronkers
1969; Lavoie 1972) have been very extensively exploited in ocean modeling. For instance,
a model with only one “slab” active layer (i.e. ﬂoating on top of a denser homogeneous
quiescent inﬁnitely deep layer) has been shown useful to study processes near the ocean
surface which, in addition to wind drag, is subject to nonuniform heat and freshwater
ﬂuxes (e.g. Young 1994; Young & Chen 1995; Fukamachi et al. 1995; Ripa 1996; Røed
1997; Scott & Willmott 2002). The main motivation for the use of these type of models
is the observation that in the upper part of the ocean a vertically well-mixed layer sepa-
rated from the underlying heavier ﬂuid by a well-deﬁned pycnocline often develops. Also,
the slab models are numerically very eﬃcient, particularly in the study of meso- and
submesoscale ocean dynamics as they can resolve, for a given computational cost, ﬁner
horizontal scales than fully three-dimensional models (Eldevik 2002). However, applica-
tions are not restricted to the study upper-ocean processes only. In these applications, a
stack of homogeneous and inhomogeneous active layers is usually considered; Ripa (1993)
has derived a model with an arbitrary number of active slab layers. Examples of these ap-
plications include one-dimensional (in the horizontal) modeling eﬀorts, typically oriented

to provide insight into the basic physics underlying the heat and salt balances in semien-
closed seas (e.g. Ripa 1997; Beron-Vera & Ripa 2002; Ripa 2001); and two-dimensional
regional ocean modeling eﬀorts (e.g. Szoeke & Richman 1984; Anderson & McCreary
1985b; McCreary & Kundu 1988; McCreary et al. 1989, 1991, 1993, 1996a; Beier 1997;
Beier & Ripa 1999; Røed & Shi 1999; Palacios-Hern´andez et al. 2002). Other applica-
tions include the study of biophysical interactions (e.g. McCreary et al. 1996b, 2001;
Hood et al. 2003), equatorial dynamics (e.g. Anderson & McCreary 1985a; McCreary & Yu
1992), and ENSO predictability (e.g. Schopf & Cane 1983; Balmaseda et al. 1994). Fur-
thermore, in the widely used Miami Isopycnic-Coordinate Ocean Model (MICOM) the
upper layer is chosen to be a slab-like layer (Bleck et al. 1992).

Despite their widespread use, the slab models are known to have several limitations
and deﬁciencies Ripa (1999): (a) they cannot represent explicitly the thermal-wind bal-
ance which dominates at low frequencies; and (b) they have a zero-frequency mode in
which the layer thickness and buoyancy changes without changing the ﬂow, and whose
unlimited growth cannot be prevented by the invariants that constrain the (inviscid un-
forced) system. Eldevik (2002) has recently pointed out also that the slab models cannot
satisfactorily represent frontogenesis, a process for which the thermal-wind balance is
fundamental.

To cure the slab model limitations and deﬁciencies, Ripa (1995, hereinafter referred to
as R95) proposed an improved closure to partially incorporate thermodynamic processes
in a one-layer model. In addition to allowing arbitrary velocity and buoyancy variations
in horizontal position and time, Ripa’s model allows the velocity and buoyancy ﬁelds
to vary linearly with depth. Ripa’s model enjoys a number of properties which make it
very promising. For instance, (a) it represents explicitly the thermal-wind balance at low
frequencies; and (b) with only one layer the free waves supported by the model (Poincar´e,
Rossby, midlatitude coastal Kelvin, equatorial, etc.) are a very good approximation to
the ﬁrst and second vertical modes in the fully three-dimensional model.

In this work I present a generalization of Ripa’s model to an arbitrary number of
layers, including two possible (mathematically equivalent) vertical conﬁgurations (
2).
§
The goal is to generalize Ripa’s model, allowing enough ﬂexibility to treat more com-
plicated problems than those that can be tackled with only one layer. Several aspects
of the generalized model are discussed in
3. These include: its conservation laws; the
§
Kelvin circulation theorems derived from the model; its Hamiltonian structure; the lack
of formal stability theorems; results on vertical normal modes and remarks on baroclinic
instability; and the incorporation of forcing in the model equations. Section 4 closes the
paper with some concluding remarks.

Consider a stack of n active ﬂuid layers with thickness hi(x, t), i = 1,

, n, where x
is the horizontal position and t the time (ﬁgure 1). The geometry can be either planar
or spherical; in the former case the vertical coordinate, z, is perpendicular to the plane,

h0(x). The usual choice in the rigid lid case is
or from above by a rigid lid, z =
0; however, laboratory experiments are often design to have a nonhorizontal top
h0 ≡
lid. The remaining boundary in the rigid-bottom (resp., rigid-lid) conﬁguration is a soft
interface with a passive inﬁnitely thick layer of lighter (resp., denser) homogeneous ﬂuid

element for the derivation of the n-layer version of Ripa’s model is the deﬁnition of the

lid conﬁguration, as the generalized multilayer nonsubinertial mixed-layer approximation
of Young (1994). A initial state with uniform buoyancy inside each layer (¯ϑi = const.
and ϑσ
0) is preserved by (2.7); as
a consequence, unlike the above reduced models, the homogeneous layers model follows
from (2.7) as a particular case, just as it does it from the fully three-dimensional model. It
is important to notice that the homogeneous layers model is exact for a stepwise density
stratiﬁcation; however, it is not able to accommodate thermodynamic processes which
are particularly important in the upper part of ocean.

3.3. Hamiltonian structure

The (inviscid unforced) fully three-dimensional primitive equations model, just as the
Euler equations of ﬂuid mechanics, possesses what is called in geometric mechanics a
“generalized or singular Hamiltonian structure.” A good sign of the validity of any ap-
proximate model derived from it is the preservation of such a structure. This topic is
treated here; readers not interested in geometric mechanics may safely skip this section.

The existence of a Lie–Poisson Hamiltonian structure, which would imply an analogous
Euler–Poincar´e structure, has not been established for the present model. The Euler–
Poincar´e structure is based on a Lagrangian functional and Hamilton’s principle, rather
than a Hamiltonian functional and a Poisson bracket (Holm et al. 2002). The use of
Hamilton’s principle, in particular, has been shown very practical in the derivation of
constrained dynamics (e.g. Salmon 1983; Holm 1996; Beron-Vera 2003) and approximate
dynamics (Holm et al. 2002). An interesting research avenue is the exploration of whether
approximations directly made in the fully-three dimensional Lagrangian can lead to the
approximate model of the present paper. The study of these topics are reserved for the
future.

3.4. Arnold stability
In R95 it was shown that for one layer a state of rest (or a steady state with at most a
uniform zonal current) can be shown to be formally stable using Arnold’s (1965, 1966)
method if and only if (2.6) is satisﬁed, i.e. if and only if the buoyancy is everywhere
positive and increases (resp., decreases) with depth within a layer with the rigid bottom
(resp., rigid lid). Arnold’s method for proving the stability of steady solution of a system
consists in searching for conditions that guarantee the sign-deﬁniteness of a general invari-
ant which is quadratic to the lowest-order in the deviation from that state; the resulting
conditions being only suﬃcient (e.g. Holm et al. 1985; McIntyre & Shepherd 1987). In
the present model, however, Arnold’s method fails to provide stability conditions even
0). The lowest-order contribution to

and Hi, gi and Ni, which are the ith-layer unperturbed depth, vertically averaged buoy-
ancy, and Brunt–V¨ais¨al¨a frequency, respectively. Similarly, a state of rest in the multilayer
slab model cannot be proved formally stable using Arnold’s method. Surprisingly, it is
possible to prove the stability of a steady state with a uniform zonal current in that
model. But the condition of stability is not one of “static” stability like (2.6) as in the
one-layer version of Ripa’s model. Contrarily, it is one of “baroclinic” stability since
a uniform current in the multilayer slab model has an implicit vertical shear through
the thermal-wind balance. These results can all be inferred from Ripa (1993) and Ripa
(1996).

It is worthwhile to mention, however, that there is at least a system, which has one
Ripa-like layer and n
1 homogeneous layers, for which a state of rest can be proved
formally stable. For instance, assuming the uppermost layer to be Ripa-like, the corre-
sponding free energy takes the form

The fact that it is not possible to prove formal stability for a steady state in the
multilayer model of this paper does not mean that state is unstable; it simply means
that Arnold’s method is not useful to prove it. One reason for the failure of Arnold’s
method is the lack of vorticity-related invariants.

3.5. Waves and instabilities
In R95 it was shown that a model with one layer supports two vertical normal modes.
The present n-layer model can support 3n

modes contributed by the n layers. A model with n homogeneous or slab layers only
supports 2n vertical normal modes. Figure 3 shows, in particular, the phase speed of
long gravity waves (c) for the barotropic and ﬁrst baroclinic mode as a function of the

The long-gravity-wave phase speeds of the model of this paper are computed numerically
by setting f
0 in (2.7) and considering inﬁnitesimal normal-mode perturbations to
(3.21). The left-hand-side panel of ﬁgure 3 shows that a one-layer version of the model
generalized here (dot-dashed line) is enough to represent the exact (solid line) barotropic
mode phase speed (c0) for all values of the stratiﬁcation parameter S (R95). The result
from a two-layer version (dashed line) cannot be distinguished from the one-layer version
and exact results in this plot. The two-homogeneous-layer model (dotted line) gives the
exact phase speed at very weak stratiﬁcation (S
0) but overestimates it somewhat as
the stratiﬁcation increases. The most striking diﬀerences appear in the representation of
the baroclinic mode phase speed. The right-hand-side panel of ﬁgure 3 shows that the
one-layer version of the model of this paper provides only a fair representation of the
phase speed of the gravest baroclinic mode (c1). The two-layer version, instead, provides
an excellent approximation for any size of S. The two-homogeneous-layer model phase
speed, in turn, overestimates the exact model phase speed for all S (the absolute value

of diﬀerence being of the same order as that produced by the one-layer version of the
present model). The reason for the improved performance of the two-layer version of
present model compared to the one-layer version and the two-homogeneous-layer model
is that with one linear function in each layer is possible to better represent the exact
vertical structure eigenfunctions than with only one linear function and one number per
layer, respectively. A considerable amount of “physics” is gained by adding to the ve-
locity and buoyancy ﬁelds a vertical shear within each layer following the simple recipe
proposed by R95. In Beron-Vera et al. (2003) we extend and complete the above calcu-
lation by considering more complicated reference vertical stratiﬁcations and computing
the vertical structure eigenfunctions. We also show that the present model supports the
usual midlatitude and equatorial gravity and vortical waves (Poincar´e, Kelvin, Rossby,
Yanai, etc.) in each of the vertical normal modes.

Let me close this section by making some remarks on baroclinic instability results.
To study baroclinic instability in the upper ocean, Beron-Vera & Ripa (1997) consid-
ered a reduced-gravity approximation. In that work it was shown that a reduced-gravity
one-layer version of Ripa’s model gives, in the limit of weak internal stratiﬁcation and
suﬃciently strong velocity’s vertical shear, the exact solution for normal-mode pertur-
bations whose scales are of the order of the external (equivalent barotropic) deformation
radius of the system. For perturbations of the order of the internal (ﬁrst baroclinic)
deformation radius, i.e. the classical Eady “waves” (cf. e.g. Pedlosky 1987), the model
resulted less successful as the exact eigensolutions have an exponential trapping behav-
ior which can be only poorly represented if the velocity and buoyancy vertical proﬁles
are restricted to a linear function of depth. The very important dynamical aspect of
the presence of a high-wavenumber cutoﬀ of instability was nonetheless captured by the
one-layer model, though overestimated in about 40 %. By virtue of the above results, I
expect this overestimation to be substantially reduced if two active layers are considered.
This is investigated in Beron-Vera et al. (2003) where we further test the present model
performance in upper-ocean baroclinic instability including ageostrophic eﬀects. The lat-
ter is done by relaxing the rigid bottom boundary constraint in the classical Stone (1966)
model.

3.6. Forcing

In R95 forcing (wind stress, interfacial drag, and buoyancy/heat input) was introduced
in the one-layer version of the present multilayer model equations in a way that was
compatible with the conservation laws of energy, momentum, and mass/heat content.
The same approach is adopted here to include, in addition, freshwater ﬂuxes through the
surface in accordance with the conservation law of salt content. The possibility for the
exchange of ﬂuid across the other interfaces is also considered.

4. Concluding remarks

This paper describes a multilayer extension of Ripa’s (1995) primitive equations one-
layer ocean model with thermodynamics. Inside each layer the velocity and buoyancy
ﬁelds can vary not only arbitrarily in the horizontal position and time, but also linearly
with depth. In the absence of external forcing and dissipation, the model conserves vol-
ume, mass, buoyancy variance, energy, and zonal momentum for a zonally symmetric do-
mains and topographies. Furthermore, as the fully three-dimensional primitive equations
from which it is derived, the present model possesses a singular Hamiltonian structure.
Unlike the multilayer slab models, i.e. those for which the velocity and buoyancy ﬁelds
are depth-independent within each layer, the model generalized here is able to represent
the thermal-wind balance explicitly at low frequency inside each layer. In this sense, the
model of this paper has better “physics” than a model with slab-like layers. For the
same number of layers, n, say, on the other hand, the model of this paper can sustain
2n
1 more vertical normal modes as homogeneous layers models, which, in addition,
are not able to incorporate thermodynamic processes. A model with only two layers has
been shown here to provide an excellent representation of the exact ﬁrst baroclinic mode
phase speed. In this other sense, the present model has more “physics” than a model
with homogeneous layers. The present generalization enriches Ripa’s single-layer model
by providing it enough ﬂexibility to approach problems for which a single-layer structure
is too idealized. Conﬁgurations with a small number of layers are particularly useful for
the insight they provide into physical processes. Conﬁgurations with more layers can be
used as the basis for an accurate numerical circulation model.

Year-ahead prediction of US landfalling hurricane numbers:
intense hurricanes

Shree Khare∗
and
Stephen Jewson

December 15, 2013

Abstract

We continue with our program to derive simple practical methods that can be used to predict the
number of US landfalling hurricanes a year in advance. We repeat an earlier study, but for a slightly
diﬀerent deﬁnition landfalling hurricanes, and for intense hurricanes only. We ﬁnd that the averaging
lengths needed for optimal predictions of numbers of intense hurricanes are longer than those needed
for optimal predictions of numbers of hurricanes of all strengths.

1 Introduction

The reinsurance industry is interested in predictions of hurricane activity on all timescales, but is most
interested in predictions that are available during the reinsurance contract renewal negotiations that
typically take place towards the end of the calendar year. Such predictions can be used directly in the
calculation of annual reinsurance premiums. Motivated by this, we are attempting to develop methods
that give good predictions of annual hurricane numbers from November of the year prior to the year
being predicted. Since this is a longer lead-time than produced in seasonal forecasts, and since next
year’s hurricane count is predicted as soon as we know this year’s count, we call this the year-ahead
prediction of hurricane numbers. Our approach is to start with the simplest possible statistical methods,
and build up to more complex methods very gradually. Hopefully in this way we will develop a clear
understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of diﬀerent methods.
Our ﬁrst attempt at year-ahead prediction of hurricane numbers was described in Khare and Jewson
(2005). We used simple averages of numbers of historical hurricanes to predict future numbers. The single
parameter in this approach is the length of the average used: we varied this parameter and performed
out-of-sample backtests on the available historical record to see what averaging lengths would have worked
well in the past. We found that shorter windows (from 6 to 28 years) worked better than longer windows,
and this result was shown to be statistically signiﬁcant. This purely empirical result corresponds well
with physical theories for hurricane numbers that suggest that there is a multidecadal cycle of hurricane
activity (Goldenberg et al., 2001), most probably governed by sea surface temperatures as part of a mode
of variability known as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) (Sutton and Hodson, 2005).
The purpose of the current study is twofold. Firstly, we repeat the previous study, described in Khare and Jewson
(2005), but using an alternative, and preferable, deﬁnition of landfalling hurricanes. We will see that
the results are more or less the same as before. Secondly, we repeat the study for intense landfalling
hurricanes only.
Intense hurricanes cause the most physical damage and so the prediction of intense
hurricanes is of the most interest to reinsurers.

2 Data

As in the Khare and Jewson (2005) study, the data we use is the HURDAT: the ‘oﬃcial’ hurricane
occurrence data set produced by the US National Hurricane Centre (Jarvinen et al., 1984). However, as
discussed above, we now use a slightly diﬀerent deﬁnition for landfalling hurricane. The previous study
used the XING variable from HURDAT, while we now use the SSS variable. The XING variable counts a
landfalling hurricane as a storm that is a hurricane at any point in its life, and that makes landfall. The

weakness of this deﬁnition is that there are a certain number of hurricanes that weaken before landfall,
and are no longer hurricanes at the moment of landfall. With the XING deﬁnition these are still classiﬁed
as landfalling hurricanes. However, from the point of view of the on-shore insurance industry, and others
who care about possible on-shore damage caused by hurricanes, such hurricanes are less interesting than
hurricanes that are still hurricanes at the point of landfall. The SSS variable that we use instead deﬁnes
‘landfalling hurricane’ as ‘a storm that is a hurricane at the point that it makes landfall’. The deﬁnition
of ‘intense landfalling hurricane’ that we use is also derived from the value of the SSS variable.
The number of landfalling hurricanes per year deﬁned using the XING variable is shown in ﬁgure 1
of Khare and Jewson (2005), while the number of landfalling hurricanes per year deﬁned using the SSS
variable is shown in ﬁgure 1 below. The diﬀerence between these two time series is shown in ﬁgure 2. In
most years this diﬀerence is negative or zero, indicating that XING > SSS as expected. However in 1 year
the diﬀerence is positive. This would seem to be an inconsistency in the HURDAT database. However,
we use the data as is, as a project is underway elsewhere to reanalyse and correct such inconsistencies.
It seems unlikely that these small inconsistencies will have any inﬂuence on our overall conclusions.
The number of intense landfalling hurricanes per year (based on the SSS variable) is shown in ﬁgure 8.

3 Method

For both all hurricanes and intense hurricanes we perform a backtesting study to determine what lengths
of averaging window would have worked well for the year-ahead prediction of hurricane numbers in the
past. The backtesting method used follows the method used in Khare and Jewson (2005) exactly. It
consists of:

1. Using data from 1940 to 2004, a backtesting comparison to evaluate the use of diﬀerent averaging
windows. The skill of each prediction is measured using MSE, and the window length that gives
the minimum MSE is described as the optimal window length.

2. A statistical test of the optimal window length, based on random reorderings of the observed

hurricane number time series.

second optimal window length.

3. A repeat of the backtesting study using data for 1900 to 2004, as a sensitivity test. This gives a

4. A repeat of the statistical test, now for the second optimal window length.

5. A repeat of the backtesting study, as a further sensitivity test, now using the 41 data series that

start with each year from 1900 to 1940, and that all end with 2004.

4 Results

4.1 All landfalling hurricanes

The results from the backtesting analysis of all landfalling hurricanes are shown in ﬁgures 3 to 7.
In ﬁgure 3 we show the results for the backtesting analysis of data from 1940 to 2004, and we see that,
as in Khare and Jewson (2005), shorter windows (from 6 to 25 years) work better than very short or
very long windows. The eﬀect is, however, slightly less strong than that seen previously: the minimum
in MSE is broader and the ‘kink’ at 46 years is more pronounced. The lowest value of MSE occurs at 16
years, and the statistical test gives this a p-value of 3.35%. Figure 4 shows the distribution of optimal
window lengths from the random reordering test.
In ﬁgure 5 we show the results for the backtesting analysis of data from 1900 to 2004. In this case, the
curve looks very similar to the corresponding curve in Khare and Jewson (2005), with the minimum lying
in a range from around 18 to 40 years. The precise minimum is at 20 years. The statistical test gives
this a p-value of 2% (40 out of 2000 cases had shorter optimal windows). Figure 6 shows the distribution
of optimal window lengths from the random reordering test, as before.
Finally ﬁgure 7 gives the distribution of optimal window lengths derived using start years from 1900 to
1941. The 41 optimal window lengths are distributed from 6 to 33 years, which is very similar to the
distribution shown in Khare and Jewson (2005), ﬁgure 7, which was in the range 6 to 28 years.
Our conclusion at this point is that switching from the XING deﬁnition of landfalling to the SSS deﬁnition
of landfalling does not make a material diﬀerence to the results given in Khare and Jewson (2005): the
number of hurricanes is still best predicted using a short window with a length somewhere in the range
6 to 33 years.

4.2 Intense landfalling hurricanes

We now describe the results from the backtesting analysis of the numbers of intense landfalling hurricanes
(where ‘intense’ is deﬁned as Saﬃr-Simpson category 3-5). Intense landfalling hurricanes are the most
important for many land-dwellers, because only for these hurricanes are the winds strong enough to cause
severe damage to property.
The numbers of intense landfalling hurricanes per year are shown in ﬁgure 8, and the backtesting results
are shown in ﬁgures 9 to 13. Using data from 1940 to 2004, the best hindcasts were for window lengths
from around 15 to 30 years, with the actual minimum occuring at 16 years (see ﬁgure 9). This has a
p-value of 3.4% (based on the random reordering results shown in ﬁgure 10, in which 67 out of 2000
cases had shorter optimal windows). Repeating the analysis for data from 1900 to 2004 gives a slightly
diﬀerent story, however. The best predictions occurred for window lengths of around 60 years, with the
precise minimum at 56 years. This is noticeably longer than the optimal window lengths in our previous
analyses. However, the distribution of the optimal window length derived from the random reordering
is also noticeably diﬀerent, with more mass at longer window lengths (see ﬁgure 12) and the value of 56
years still has a p-value of only 8.3%. In ﬁgure 13 we show the optimal window lengths obtained using
data periods starting from 1900 to 1941, and we see values from 16 to 56.
From these results we conclude that the predictability properties of intense hurricanes are diﬀerent from
those of all hurricanes: longer averaging windows are needed.

4.3 Sources of forecast error variance

Figures 3, 5, 9 and 11 all show the decomposition of the MSE into bias (dotted line) and variance (solid
line) terms. For short windows we see that the variance term completely dominates. This term can be
decomposed further, into ‘internal variability’ and ‘sampling error’ terms. We show this decomposition
for the four variance curves in these four ﬁgures in ﬁgure 14. What we see is that in all cases the reason
that very short windows give poor predictions is mostly because of the high level of sampling error, as
we might expect.

5 Conclusions

We are interested in predicting the number of landfalling hurricanes and the number of intense landfalling
hurricanes, one year in advance. We are investigating using very simple time averages of historical
hurricane numbers to make these predictions. Speciﬁcally, we have performed two studies:

• We have repeated the analysis of Khare and Jewson (2005), but for a more appropriate and more

standard deﬁnition of ‘landfalling hurricane’.

• We have repeated the analysis of Khare and Jewson (2005), but for intense landfalling hurricanes

only.

The results are as follows. For all landfalling hurricanes, we ﬁnd more or less the same results as we
found in Khare and Jewson (2005), which are that:

• Short averaging windows, in the range from 6 years to 33 years, would have given the best predictions

• But there is a lot of uncertainty around any point estimate of the best window length

For intense landfalling hurricanes, the results are interestingly diﬀerent from the results for all hurricanes.
Again we found that short windows give the best predictions. But now the window lengths are longer:
from 16 to 56 years. This suggests that the nature of the predictability of intense hurricanes is diﬀerent
from that of all hurricanes. It seems possible that there may be a purely statistical explanation for this:
intense hurricanes are less common, and as a result the intense hurricane time series has a lower signal to
noise ratio than the time series for all hurricanes. However whether this can really explain the diﬀerences
that we see needs further, and more detailed, investigation.
Where does this leave us with respect to making practical forecasts of hurricane numbers (intense or
otherwise) a year in advance? The biggest hurdle in making such predictions seems to be the problem
of which window length to choose from within the wide ranges that emerge from our analysis. For all
hurricanes, we could choose any number from 6 to 33 years. For intense hurricanes, we could choose
any number from 16 to 56 years. These diﬀerent choices would give very diﬀerent results. How can we
reduce this arbitrariness in a non-arbitrary way? Currently the most attractive answer seems to be to

use weighting of each of these forecasts (or of forecasts using all possible window lengths), where the
weighting is based on the likelihood scores achieved in the backtesting experiment. Testing this is one of
our future priorities.

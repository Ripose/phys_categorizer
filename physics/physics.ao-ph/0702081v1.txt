We show that the universal properties of the rainfall phenomenon are the scaling properties of
the probability density function of inter-drop intervals during quiescent periods, time intervals of
sparse precipitation, and the universal shape of the probability density function of drop diameters
during non-quiescent periods, time intervals of active precipitation. Our results indicate that the
continuous ﬂux-like vision of rainfall based on quantities such as the rain duration, rain intensity and
drought duration is ineﬀective in detecting the universality of the phenomenon. A comprehensive
understanding of rainfall behavior must rest on the acknowledgment of its discrete drop-like nature.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Rainfall is a discrete drop-like phenomenon that has of-
ten been described as a continuous ﬂux-like phenomenon.
The most common instrument used to measure the rain,
the pluviometer, collects the water volume fallen through
a given area per unit of time. The use of pluviometers
and the importance of knowing intensity and duration of
the rainfall phenomenon has lead to a description based
on ﬂux-like quantities such as the rain duration, rain in-
tensity and drought duration [2], even when radar mea-
surement are used to infer the precipitable volume of rain
[13]. A ﬂux-like view of rainfall is also central to the
random cascade formalism used to describe rainfall pat-
tern both in time and space [e.g., 4, 9, 10, 12]. From
a drop-like perspective, a considerable amount of work
[e.g., 1, 3, 6, 11] has been dedicated to the study the
properties of raindrop spectra: the number of drops per
diameter millimeter interval per cubic meter of air. Dou-
ble stochastic Poisson processes have been used to de-
scribe the variability in the drop counts per unit interval
[e.g., 5, 16]. Only recently [7, 8] an extensive study has
been done of the properties of the sequences of inter drop
time intervals and drop diameters as measured on the
ground by disdrometers. Due to its importance for many
aspects of human life, the rainfall phenomenon has been
widely investigated. However, few works [e.g: 17] are ex-
plicitly dedicated to discuss the universal properties of
the rainfall phenomenon. No entries were found (using
common literature search engines) for works containing
in their titles both the words “universality” (or univer-
sal) and “rainfall” (or rain). So, are there any properties
that a rain shower in New York and one in Rome have
in common?

In this letter, using data from the Joss Waldvogel im-
pact disdrometer RD-69 located at Chilbolton (UK), we
provide evidences that the universal properties of rain-
fall phenomenon lie in the properties of drop-like quan-
tities such as the inter drop time interval and the drop
diameter. We show that 1) the ﬂux-like view of the rain-
fall phenomenon is not adequate to capture its universal
features. 2) The temporal variability of rain can be de-

scribed in terms of quiescent periods, periods of sparse
precipitation characterized by a small drop diameter av-
erage, and non quiescent periods, periods of active pre-
cipitation characterized by a large drop diameter aver-
age diameter. Moreover, the average and variance of the
sequence of drop diameters are not stationary. 3) The
probability density function of the inter drop time in-
tervals τ has an universal feature: a power law regime
in the region τ &1min and τ .1h. Inter drop time inter-
vals in this range belong to quiescent periods. Finally,
an universal shape for the probability density function
of drop diameters during non-quiescent periods emerges
upon removal of the non stationarity of the sequence of
drop diameters.

II. FLUX-LIKE VIEW OF A DROP-LIKE
PHENOMENON

The ﬂux-like view of rainfall is that of a ON-OFF pro-
cess. The rainfall time series is an alternating sequence of
consecutive time intervals of duration ∆>0, the integra-
tion time of the instrument used to monitor the precipi-
tation, with (ON) or without (OFF) detectable precipi-
tation. The relevant quantities [e.g., 13] are the duration
of ON and OFF periods (rain duration and drought du-
ration) and the volume of rain fallen during consecutive
OFF periods (rain intensity). An integration time ∆>0
causes all drop time intervals of duration τ <∆ to be lost
(equivalent to be detected as a drought of null duration),
and all inter drop time intervals of duration τ >∆ to be
detected as drought of duration [τ /∆]−1 or [τ /∆] ([.]
indicates the integer part). Thus, in the limit τ ≫∆

P d

∆(τ ) ∝ ∆ψ(τ ),

(1)

where P d
∆(τ ) is the distribution of drought durations and
ψ(τ ) is probability density function of inter drop time
intervals. Eq. (1) shows that distributions of drought
durations relative to diﬀerent integration times ∆ will
all have the same features at large times (τ ≫∆) as con-
ﬁrmed by panel (a) of Fig. 1. This property is lost for
the distributions of rain durations P r
∆(τ ), panel (b) of

Fig. 1, and rain intensities P i
∆(v), panel (c) of Fig. 1. As
the integration time ∆ increases a larger amount of inter
drop time intervals are lost and rain durations that were
separated by a drought duration are now detected as a
longer rain period. This eﬀect produces larger rain du-
rations and, together with the temporal ordering of the
sequence of drop diameters, larger rain intensities.

The properties of the sequences of inter drop time in-

late into those of the distributions of rain durations
(P r

quantities are not valuable proxies to investigate the uni-
versal properties of the rainfall phenomenon.

III. TEMPORAL VARIABILITY

Our data are from a Joss Waldvogel impact disdrom-
eter RD-69 with a time integration ∆=10s, and 127 dif-
ferent diameter classes (from 0.2998 mm to 4.9952 mm).
Thus, we can record neither all the inter drop time inter-
vals less than 10s, nor the exact arrival ordering of drops.

However, some properties of the temporal variability of
the rainfall phenomenon can be inferred.

A. Quiescence

Quiescence is a way of describing the temporal vari-
ability of the rainfall phenomenon based on the relation-
ship between inter drop time intervals and drop diame-
ters. We divide the rainfall time series in time intervals
of length δ. A couple of consecutive time intervals of
detectable precipitation may be separated by k>0 con-
secutive droughts (empty intervals) or be adjacent.
In
this case we say that the couple is separated by k=0
consecutive droughts. Finally, for each couple we eval-
uate the average number of drops navg, and the aver-
age drop diameter davg. Fig. 2 shows the relationship
between the couple average number of drops, the cou-
ple average drop diameter and the number of consec-
utive droughts in between the couple for δ=10s. We
see the tendency for a number of consecutive droughts
k≥1 (interdrop time intervals τ ≥10s) to separate cou-
ples with a small average number of drops (.5) and a
small average drop diameter (.0.6mm). To quantify this
tendency, we introduce the concept of quiescence of order
(δ, m, n). A couple of consecutive time intervals of length
δ with detectable precipitation and separated by k con-
secutive droughts is a quiescent couple of order (δ, m, n),
if:

k ≥ m or

k < m but navg ≤ n,

(2)

where navg is the couple average number of drops.

Quiescent (non-quiescent) periods are rainfall periods
occupied by consecutive quiescent (non-quiescent) cou-
ples. During quiescent periods, large inter drop inter-
vals (τ ≥mδ) are preceded and followed by few (navg≤n)
drops of small diameter (Fig. 2). Non-quiescent or ac-
tive periods are characterized by small inter drop time
intervals (τ <mδ) separating drops with a larger range
of diameters (Fig. 2). Non quiescent periods are respon-
sible for the bulk of precipitation:
for a quiescence of
order (δ=10s, m=1, n=5) >95% of the precipitated vol-
ume of water belongs to non quiescent periods. Some
care is necessary in choosing the duration δ of the time
intervals dividing the rainfall time series: a δ too large
(&10 minutes) will result in a mixing quiescent with non-
quiescent periods, a δ too small (.1 second) will re-
sult in too many time integration intervals with just one
drop. Two quiescence of order (δ, m, n) and (δ′, m′, n′)
are “equivalent” if m′=m(δ/δ′) and n′=n(δ/δ′).

B. Drop diameter variability

[6] introduce the concept of averaged “instant” shape
to characterized the variability of raindrop spectra and
their departure from the exponential form observed by
[11]. [14] show that the probability density function η(d)
of drop diameters may change according to the portion
(e.g.: dissipative edge, cloud base) or the type of storm
(e.g.: orographic, non orographic) observed by a dis-
drometer. Here, we show the temporal variability of the
sequence of drop diameter is characterized by a moving
average and a moving variance. Fig. 2 indicates that the
sequence of drop diameters does not have a constant av-
erage, as quiescent periods have a lower average diameter
than non-quiescent periods. A closer examination of the
sequence of drop diameters reveals that its average to-
gether with its variance are not stationary. Support for
this thesis comes also from the results of [8]. They report
for the autocorrelation function of the sequence of drop
diameters with a slow decay (the autocorrelation function
reaches zero at lag ≈1250) followed by a long negative tail
(lag &1250). The auto correlation function (as conﬁrmed
by simulations not reported here for brevity) of sequences
of drop diameters exponentially and normally distributed
with changing intensity around a moving average has the
same features of that of [8].

IV. UNIVERSALITY

In Fig. 3, we plot the probability P d

∆(θ>τ ) of having a
drought duration larger than τ for several time intervals
of continuous observations at Chilbolton over a period of
almost 2 years. All curves show a power law regime in the
region between τ &1min and τ .1h. The extensive period
of time covered by our data, together with observations in
other location of Earth’s surface [7, 13], indicate that the
power law regime in the region from 1 minute to 1 hour of

3

Fig. 3 is an universal property of the probability density
function ψ(τ ) of inter drop time intervals (Eq. 1). This
power law regime is a characteristic of quiescent periods:
all quiescent couples (Eq. 2) of order (δ=10s, m=1, n=5)
are separated by inter drop time intervals τ ≥10s (Fig. 2).
Moreover, Fig. 3 suggests that the end of the power law
regime at τ ≈1h signals a time scale separation between
two diﬀerent dynamics: the inter storm dynamics where
quiescent and non-quiescent periods alternate each other,
and the dynamics regulating the occurrence of diﬀerent
storms (meteorological dynamics). Thus, the probabil-
ity density function ψ(τ ) of inter drop time intervals can
be thought as the sum of three components: 1) ψNQ(τ ),
the probability density function of non quiescent periods
(τ ∈[0s, . 10s]). 2) ψQ(τ ), the probability density func-
tion of quiescent periods (τ ∈[& 0s, . 1h]) with a power
law regime in the region between τ &1min and τ .1h. 3)
ψQM(τ ), the probability density function describing the
meteorological variability (τ &1h) of the particular loca-
tion where the measurements are done. The index Q in
ψQM(τ ) indicates that all inter drop time intervals τ &1h
belongs to quiescent periods (Eq. 2 and Fig. 2).

The period of continuous observation were: from April 1st to
November 3rd 2003 (white squares), from November 5th 2003
to January 5th 2004 (black squares), from January 8th to
January 20th 2004 (black circles), from January 24th to May

2004 (white diamonds), from December 10th 2004 to Febru-
ary 28th 2005 (white pentagons). The curves are shifted for
clarity. The ticks on the y axis indicates diﬀerent decades.

In panel (a) of Fig. 4, we plot the probability den-
sity functions ηQ(d) of drop diameters of quiescent pe-
riods relative to diﬀerent months of observations. The
observed variability is due to the non stationary char-
acter of the sequence of drop diameters (Sec. III B). In
fact, if the non stationarity is removed an universal shape

for the probability density function emerges. We con-
sider non-overlapping time intervals of duration T and
remove the average in every time interval. Panel (b)
of Fig. 4 shows that the probability density function
ηQ(dT,µ) of the zero-average drop diameters sequence has
a much smaller variability than the probability density
function ηQ(d) of the original sequence (Fig. 4 panel (a)).
If together with moving average also the moving vari-
ance is eliminated (e.g. rescaling to unity the variance
in each time interval), the probability density functions
ηQ(dT,µ,σ) of the zero-average unitary-variance drop di-
ameter sequences relative to diﬀerent months “collapse”
into a single curve (Fig. 4 panels (b) and (c)). The shape
of this curve is not appreciably altered either by the
choice of time intervals of diﬀerent duration T (ranging
from 10 seconds to ≈10 minutes) to remove the non sta-
tionarity of the sequence of drop diameters of quiescent
periods, either by the use of diﬀerent quiescence orders
(n of Eq. (2) ranging from 5 to 20) and of their “equiv-
alence” classes (m and δ of Eq. (2) changing in such
a way to preserve the factors mδ and nδ). The prob-
ability density function ηQ(dT,µ,σ) of the zero-average
unitary-variance drop diameter sequence has two asymp-
totic exponential tails: one for the positive and one for
the negative values of the rescaled zero-averaged diame-
ters (Fig. 4 panels (b) and (c)). A least squares ﬁt of the
exponential tails produce the following values for the de-
cay constants: λ+=2 (2mm≤dT,µ,σ≤6mm) and λ−=4.56
(−4mm≤dT,µ,σ≤−2mm).

V. CONCLUSIONS

We introduce the concept of quiescence to describe the
temporal variability of the rainfall phenomenon. The qui-
escence captures a fundamental relationship (Fig. 2) be-
tween inter drop time intervals, drop diameter and their
time ordering. These properties are not detected by the
ﬂux-like quantities such as rain duration and rain inten-
sity. Using the concept of quiescence, we identify what
are the universal properties of the rainfall phenomenon.
The scaling property of the probability density func-
tion of inter drop time intervals during quiescent periods
(Fig. 3) and the universal shape for probability density
function of drop diameters (Fig. 4). Our results sug-
gest that the analysis of inter drop time intervals and
drop diameters sequences and their properties oﬀers a
deeper insight than the analysis of the properties of ﬂux-
like quantities such as rain duration and rain intensity. A
comprehensive understanding of the rainfall phenomenon

must rest on its drop-like nature.

It is noted that the results of recent experiments on the enhancement of turbulent kinetic
energy (TKE) dissipation below surface waves can be stated as follows. TKE dissipation is
enhanced by a factor 15Hws/z at depths 0.5Hws < z < 20Hws with respect to the wall-layer
result ǫ = u3
∗w/κz, where u∗w is the friction velocity in water and Hws is the signiﬁcant wind-
sea wave height. For open ocean conditions, this reduces in most cases to an enhancement
factor 106u2

10/gz.

∗w/gz ≈ U 2

Recently, a group of experimentalists and theorists has succeeded in measuring and interpreting
how turbulent kinetic energy dissipation is much enhanced below surface waves in the WAVES
experiment (Agrawal et al. 1992, Terray et al. 1996) and also in the SWADE experiment (Drennan
et al. 1996).

In Fig. 1a, their results are shown for the enhancement of TKE dissipation ǫ with respect to
to the wall-layer result ǫwall = u3
∗w. Here u∗w is
the friction velocity in water. A general enhancement is clear, but there is no clear relationship
between the enhancement factor and the dimensionless depth. Moreover, WAVES and SWADE
data appear to be diﬀerent.

∗w/κz as a function of dimensionless depth gz/u2

Terray et al. 1996 point out that there are two important scaling variables for wave-enhanced
TKE dissipation: windsea wave height Hws and energy dissipation of surface waves. The latter
will be equal to the energy input F from the wind to surface waves. Using these variables, they
ﬁnd a clear relation: ǫHws/F = 0.3(Hws/z)2 for WAVES. The SWADE data (Drennan et al. 1996)
satisfy the very same relation as the WAVES data (Fig. 1b).

To estimate enhanced TKE dissipation, the relation of Terray et al. has the drawback that
one has to estimate somehow the wind input F . But this is not really necessary. An equally
good ﬁt can be obtained by using u3
∗w instead of F , with the added advantage that the result can
be written as an enhancement factor times the wall-layer result. This is shown in Fig. 1c. The
straight line corresponds to

H
z
Note that Fig. 1 is a log-log plot and that the uncertainty in the factor 15 is quite large. The ﬁt
of Fig. 1b is only slightly better than the ﬁt of Fig. 1c; a slightly better ﬁt than that of Fig. 1b
can be obtained using u2
∗wcp instead of F (not shown), with cp the wave velocity at the windsea
peak frequency.

Aproaching the surface, TKE dissipation should not grow without bound. Using that TKE
dissipation integrated over depth should equal the wind-input F , Terray et al. 1996 arrived at a

1

constant dissipation layer of a depth 0.6Hws. Assuming F ≈ 150u3
here.

∗s, the same reasoning applies

Finally, I note that the waves of WAVES were very little developed, because they were only 1 km
from the coast. In contrast, the waves of SWADE resembled much more those of the open ocean.
In open ocean conditions, windsea is most of the time well developed, i.e. 5 104 < gHws/u2
∗s < 105,
except in strong storms. So for open ocean conditions, eq. (1) can be approximated by

ǫ = 106u2

∗w/(gz)

∗w

Note that this ”open ocean” line does not go at all through the WAVES points in Fig. 1! To
change in eq. (2) from u∗w to U10, the windspeed at 10 m height, one can use 106u2
10/gz.

∗w/gz ≈ U 2

Figure 1. Dissipation vs. depth in WAVES(crosses) and SWADE (diamonds). To make the corre-
spondence between the plots more clear, data of some WAVES runs are plotted with smaller symbols than
others. In (a) ǫκz/u3
∗w is shown, together with the open ocean relation (2). In (b), the relation
ǫHws/F = 0.3(Hws/z)2 of Terray et al. 1996 is shown. In (c), the ﬁt of eq. (1) ǫ = 15(H/z)u3
∗w/(κz) is
shown.

Global warming: What does the data tell us?

Abstract

We analyze global surface temperature data obtained at 13472 weather
stations from the year 1702 to 1990. The mean annual temperature of
a station ﬂuctuates from year to year by typically ≈ ±0.6oC (one stan-
dard deviation). Superimposed on this ﬂuctuation is a linear increase
of the temperature by typically ≈ 0.40 ± 0.01oC per century ever since
reliable data is available, i.e. since 1702 (errors are statistical only,
one standard deviation). The world population has doubled from 1952
to 1990, yet we see no statistically signiﬁcant acceleration of global
warming in this period. We conclude that the eﬀect of humankind
on global warming up to 1990 is 0.0 ± 0.1oC. Therefore, contrary to
popular belief, the data support the view that human activity has had
no signiﬁcant eﬀect on global warming up to the year 1990 covered by
this study.

1 Introduction

We present a study of global warming based on the data obtained at 13472
weather stations covering the period from 1702 to 1990. In particular we are
interested in ﬁnding the eﬀect of human activity on global warming. Since
the world population doubled from 1952 to 1990, we search for any changes
in the trend of global warming between the ﬁrst and second halves of the
20’th century.

The data used in this study is described in Section 2, the analysis is

presented in Section 3 and the conclusions are collected in Section 4.

2 The data

The temperature data set used in this analysis is “The Global Historical
Climatology Network (GHCN) version 2” released in 1997.[1] This data
is a “comprehensive global surface baseline climate data set designed for
monitoring and detecting climate change.” In particular we used the “Ad-
justed Monthly Mean Temperature Data” (in ﬁle v2.mean.adj) and the “Raw
Monthly Mean Temperature Data” (in ﬁle v2.mean). Each station is labeled
by a 12 digit code.

3 Discussion

We deﬁne a “valid year” for a particular station as a year that has all twelve
months with valid mean temperatures. We average these twelve monthly
temperatures to obtain the “mean annual temperature” for that station. In
Figures 1, 2 and 3 we present the mean annual temperatures Ti of the three
oldest stations using the “Raw Monthly Mean Temperature Data” set. In
Figure 4 we present the corresponding temperatures of our home city Quito.

Figure 2: Mean annual temperature of station 633062600000 in the Nether-
lands. Raw data. a1 = 0.46 ± 0.07oC per century.

We ﬁt these temperatures to a straight line. The slopes a1 for the period
covered by the data are shown in the ﬁgure captions. All errors in this article
are statistical and one standard deviation or 68% conﬁdence. The high slope
of the temperature measured in Quito may be due to the fact that the city
grew around the weather station.

Figure 5 presents global warming at-a-glance. This ﬁgure was obtained as
follows. We consider stations that have the ﬁrst valid year less than or equal
to 1900 and the last valid year greater than or equal to 1990. Furthermore
we require at least 85 valid years between 1900 and 1990 inclusive. We
chose these stations to be able to make meaningfull comparisons of global
warming between the ﬁrst and second halves of the 20’th century. We deﬁne
the “reference temperature” of a station to be the average temperature of
valid years between 1945 and 1955 inclusive (so at least one valid year in
this interval is required). In Figure 5 we present the diﬀerence between the
average temperature per 5 year bin and the reference temperature, averaged
over all stations in the “Raw Monthly Mean Temperature Data” set passing
the selection criteria. In Figure 6 we present the corresponding information
for the “Adjusted Monthly Mean Temperature Data” set.

From these ﬁgures we see that the global temperature has been increasing

since the earliest measurements in 1702. We see no acceleration of global
warming in the second half of the 20’th century compared to the ﬁrst half.

The data shown in Figures 5 and 6 are dominated by stations in the USA
as can be seen in Figure 7. However, the general conclusions, i.e. warming
since the earliest measurements and no acceleration of the warming in the
second half of the 20’th century, can be observed elsewhere as shown in
Figures 8 to 11.

4 Conclusions

The mean annual temperature of a station ﬂuctuates from year to year by
typically ≈ ±0.6oC (one standard deviation). Superimposed on this ﬂuctu-
ation is a linear increase of temperature by typically ≈ 0.40 ± 0.01oC per
century ever since reliable data is available, i.e.
since 1702, as shown in
Figure 5. All errors are statistical only, one standard deviation. The world
population has doubled from 1952 to 1990 as seen in Figure 12, yet we see
no statistically signiﬁcant acceleration of global warming in that period: see
Figures 5 to 11. We conclude that the eﬀect of humankind on global warm-

support the view that human activity has had no signiﬁcant eﬀect on global
warming up to the year 1990 covered by this study.

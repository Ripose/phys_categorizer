Abstract

Urban ozone concentrations are determined by the balance between ozone destruction,

chemical production and supply through advection and turbulent down-mixing from higher

levels. At high latitudes, low levels of solar insolation and high horizontal advection speeds

reduce photochemical production and the spatial ozone concentration patterns are largely

determined by the reaction of ozone with nitric oxide and dry deposition to the surface.

A Lagrangian column model has been developed to simulate the mean (monthly and an-

nual) three-dimensional structure in ozone and nitrogen oxides (N Ox) concentrations in the

boundary-layer within and immediately around an urban areas. The short time-scale pho-

tochemical processes of ozone and N Ox, as well as emissions and deposition to the ground,

are simulated.

The model has a horizontal resolution of 1x1km and high resolution in the vertical. It

has been applied over a 100x100km domain containing the city of Edinburgh (at latitude

56◦N) to simulate the city-scale processes of pollutants. Results are presented, using aver-

aged wind-ﬂow frequencies and appropriate stability conditions, to show the extent of the

depletion of ozone by city emmisions. The long-term average spatial patterns in the surface

ozone and N Ox concentrations over the model domain are reproduced quantitatively. The

model shows the average surface ozone concentrations in the urban area to be lower than

the surrounding rural areas by typically 50% and that the areas experiencing a 20% ozone

depletion are generally restricted to within the urban area. The depletion of the ozone

concentration to less than 50% of the rural surface values extends only 20m vertically above

the urban area. A series of monitoring sites for ozone, nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide on

a north-south transect through the city - from an urban, through a semi-rural, to a remote

rural location - allows the comparison of modelled with observed data for the mean diurnal

cycle of ozone concentrations. In the city-centre, the cycle is well reproduced, but the ozone

concentration is consistently overestimated.

Introduction

Tropospheric ozone is a photochemical oxidant formed largely by photochemical reactions. In

the troposphere ozone acts as a greenhouse gas (Fishman et al. 1979), (Chalita et al. 1996) and

is toxic to plants, reducing crop yields (Hewitt et al. 1990), and to humans as a respiratory

irritant (WHO 1987), as well as damaging both natural and man-made materials, such as

stone, brick-work and rubber, (PORG 1993). Quantifying the dose and exposure of the human

population, vegetation and materials to ozone is required to assess the scale of ozone impacts

and to develop control strategies.

A network of 17 rural ozone monitoring stations across the UK provides broad-scale regional

spatial patterns in tropospheric ozone concentrations in rural areas (PORG 1993). Peak ozone

concentrations increase from north to south across the UK as the south has higher concen-

trations of the primary pollutants necessary for ozone production (from greater emissions and

proximity to continental sources) as well as greater frequency of meteorological conditions suit-

Nicholson et. al.

able for ozone production. Mean ozone concentrations also increase with altitude (PORG 1997)

and are higher in a 5-10km coastal strip (Entwistle et al. 1997). The mean annual-average back-

ground concentration of ozone for the UK is approximately 50µg m−3, though there is a wide

variation for individual episodes about this value, ranging up to about 400µg m−3 (PORG

1993). There are clear diurnal and annual cycles in ozone concentrations in the UK, with a

mid-afternoon peak and nocturnal minimum and a spring maximum and autumn minimum.

The diurnal cycle illustrates the fundamental importance of vertical mixing (Garland and Der-

went 1979).

Ozone concentrations in urban areas are of particular interest and importance as the population

is largely urban-based and ozone concentrations show greater spatial and temporal variations in

urban areas. Ozone concentrations are smaller in urban areas than they are in surrounding rural

areas due to the reaction of ozone with nitric oxide, emitted from combustion sources, forming

nitrogen dioxide. Where air is allowed to stagnate over an urban area, the eﬀects of strong

insolation and accumulating ozone precursors can produce very high ozone concentrations. An

example of this is the photochemical smog that aﬀects the Los Angeles area of California,

where a combination of meteorology, local topography and very high pollutant emission levels

produce dangerously high ozone concentrations on many days of the year (Lents and Kelly

1993). However, in much of the UK and other high-latitude areas where insolation levels are

lower and wind-speeds are larger (maintaining a steady advection of air through the urban

air-shed), there is a diﬀerent spatial distribution of concentrations with annual mean ozone

concentrations generally smaller in urban areas.

There are many urban sites at which ozone is monitored in the UK (PORG 1997). Attempts

to map ozone concentrations using both rural and urban monitoring are complicated by the

interaction of local chemistry with the larger-scale meteorological factors determining ozone

concentrations. Recent studies on higher resolution ozone mapping have used an urbanisation

Nicholson et. al.

4

index (PORG 1997), but these have not been able to account for the movement of ozone and

ozone-depleted air into and out of the urban areas.

Various studies have examined the characteristics of ozone and nitrogen oxide concentrations

around urban areas (Ball and Bernard 1978). A large number of studies have focussed on

the two-dimensional structure of the ‘urban plume’ of photochemical-ozone downwind of a

city, with diﬀerent cities around the world being studied (Cleveland et al. 1976), (White et

al. 1976), (Varey et al. 1988), (Lin et al. 1996) and (Silibello et al. 1998). There have been

few studies of the three-dimensional mean structure of ozone concentrations in urban areas,

especially at high latitudes, where ozone production is of secondary importance in describing

the spatial distributions around cities. These studies are largely interpretations of observational

data (Angle and Sandhu 1989) and (Leahey and Hansen 1990).

A boundary-layer Lagrangian column model has been developed to simulate the mean three-

dimensional structure in ozone and nitrogen oxide concentrations in the boundary-layer within

and immediately around high-latitude urban areas at a spatial scale of 1x1km. (The model

is not appropriate for use with “real time” trajectories.) The model simulates the eﬀects

of ozone depletion at the surface as a consequence of the reaction with emitted nitric oxide

and dry deposition to the surface. This has been used to follow a range of one-dimensional

trajectories over a distance of 105m and a travel time in the order of 104s, through a simulated

city under a variety of meteorological and pollutant emission regimes representing seasonal

and diurnal extremes. An assessment of the extent of ozone destruction occurring, the rate of

recovery of surface ozone concentrations downwind of the city and the inﬂuence of meteorological

parameters on the ozone concentration has been provided using the model.

The model has been applied over a 100x100km domain containing a simulation of the emission

ﬁeld over the city of Edinburgh. Edinburgh was used as a generic, high-latitude city for mod-

5

elling purposes. A land-use array has been created as input to the model with spatially- and

temporally-variable emission and deposition values.

2 Ozone Destruction by Nitric Oxide

High latitude cities are, in general, well-ventillated, so that the timescale for air traversing the

city is small compared to that for ozone generation. Under these conditions, the three reactions

that are fundamental in the determination of ozone (O3) concentrations in urban areas (Wayne

1991) are:

O + O2 + M → O3 + M

k1

N O2 + hν → NO + O

J2

N O + O3 → N O2 + O2

k3

where k1 and k3 are reaction rate constants and J2 is the photolysis rate for nitrogen dioxide

(N O2).

In the UK, the main source of nitrogen oxides is the combustion of fossil fuels, ie. the burning

of coal, oil and gas in power stations and the combustion of petrol and diesel by road traﬃc

(Salway et al. 1997). The largest source in large urban areas is the exhaust from road vehicles.

The emissions are mainly N O with ratios of N O:N O2 in excess of about 3:1 (Selles et al. 1996).

A large amount of this N O is rapidly oxidised by ozone (Reaction 3).

The diurnal cycle of urban ozone concentrations show a maximum concentration at night from

Nicholson et. al.

6

0100 to 0500 hours when traﬃc density, and hence N O emissions, are lowest (PORG 1997).

Minimum concentrations occur when the N O concentration peaks during the morning and

evening rush hours. Wind-speed also has an eﬀect on urban ozone concentrations with ozone-

rich air advected into the city from the surrounding countryside in windy condition. At the

same time, N O emitted in the city is diluted in the well-mixed air and so Reaction (3) is less

dominant - reducing both O3 destruction and N O2 production (Oke 1992).

3 Experimental Method

3.1 Description of the Model Used

The TERN model (Transport over Europe of Reduced Nitrogen) was developed in the early

1990s (ApSimon et al. 1994) to examine the release, transport and chemistry of ammonia. It is

a Lagrangian column model with detailed vertical resolution and diurnally varying emissions,

deposition and turbulent mixing. It was further developed to examine ammonia and ammonium

transport and deposition over the UK (Singles et al. 1998). It can be used to obtain vertical

concentration proﬁles of pollutants emitted or generated at or near the surface and transported

over long distances on a single trajectory.

This Lagrangian column model was considered suitable as a basis for a model to be used in this

study of urban ozone concentrations because it allows detailed vertical mixing to be considered

and thus is able to represent the marked variations with height of the concentration proﬁles.

An Eulerian model with a comparable run-time would not give the required vertical resolution

(ApSimon et al. 1994). The TERN model has been considerably modiﬁed so as to be more

suitable to modelling ozone concentrations in a city but the basic processes of calculating the

extent of vertical mixing and the exchange between the vertical layers have remained the same.

Nicholson et. al.

7

The detailed vertical resolution was used to provide a sophisticated treatment of the vertical

diﬀusion of the pollutant species. The column of air that is advected over the surface (in the

absence of vertical shear in the column) is the lowest 2.5km of the troposphere and is divided

into 33 layers. There is much ﬁner resolution near the surface (the lowest ﬁve layers are of depth

1, 2, 2, 4 and 15m), allowing more detail where the highest concentration gradients occur. The

neglect of lateral dispersion, both by shear and turbulence, is not a serious omission for two

reasons: ﬁrstly, the model is principally used to determine mean ﬁelds, for which climatological

wind data are used, covering the whole 360 degrees; and secondly, the relatively small spatial

scale of both the application of the model (and the resulting ﬁelds), means that changes due to

lateral mixing are small compared to those due to vertical mixing.

Parameterisation of the boundary layer includes the eﬀects on the mixing layer depth and the

vertical diﬀusivity of the meteorological variables - insolation, cloud cover and wind-speed. The

mixing layer depth is calculated on a diurnally varying pattern depending on the time of day and

the prevailing meteorological conditions. Carson’s model (Carson 1973) is used to calculate the

development during the day, with a mechanical mixing factor proportional to the geostrophic

wind-speed. At night, the depth is determined from a combination of the Pasquill category and

the wind-speed (Pasquill 1961).

The vertical mixing of gases, is determined using the diﬀusion equation:

δC
δt

=

δ
δz (cid:18)

Kz

δC
δz (cid:19)

(4)

The coeﬃcient of mixing, Kz, is deﬁned as a function of height for diﬀerent stability conditions.

In the model, Kz is assumed to linearly increase with height to a value of Kmax at height zm

and to be constant above this height up to the top of the mixed layer. During the day, zm is

ﬁxed at 200m and Kmax is dependent on the larger of two terms, one representing mechanical

Nicholson et. al.

8

mixing and the second on convective mixing. The ﬁrst of these terms is dependent on stability

and wind speed and the second on surface heat ﬂux. At night, both Kmax and zm are dependent

on wind speed and cloud cover (ApSimon et al. 1994).

TERN’s treatment of mechanical turbulence takes no account of the surface roughness. How-

ever, in the city the increased roughness eﬀect of the buildings would increase the turbulence

of the air compared to the countryside. Assuming a logarithmic wind proﬁle over the lowest

200m (with no zero-plane displacement) and surface roughnesses of 0.05m for rural and 1.0m

for urban areas (Stull 1997), the ratio of urban to rural friction velocities was calculated to be

1.5. This factor is used as a scaling factor for Kz to simulate enhanced mixing over urban areas.

A diurnally-varying dry deposition velocity (VD), is included for nitrogen dioxide and ozone

(Hargreaves et al. 1992).

The chemistry employed in the model is very simple, with ozone destruction and production

by Reactions (1-3) included but ozone production through hydrocarbon degradation ignored.

Photodissociation (Reaction 2) is dependent on radiation levels which are parameterised in

terms of time of day, time of year and climatological cloud cover.

The time-step used can be varied over a wide range of values but the chemistry involved requires

time-steps of a few seconds to be treated accurately. The time-step used for all model runs was

1.5 seconds (or 40min−1). The chemistry would actually have allowed for a longer time-step

than this, which would have been desirable in keeping the run-time down, but the diﬀerential

equations used to calculate vertical diﬀusion became unstable at low wind-speeds with longer

time-steps.

3.2 Edinburgh Data

9

A large part of this study has been performed on a model of the city of Edinburgh: a city of

450,000 inhabitants on the east coast of Great Britain at a latitude of 56◦. The city is set on

a coastal plain between the Firth of Forth to the north and a range of 600m hills to the south.

It is a centre of ﬁnance and service industries and as such does not have a large number of

factories in the city centre or nearby. It does however have a rapidly expanding road vehicle

ﬂeet that generates N Ox. It is also a compact city, approximately 10km in diameter, with little

suburban sprawl or outlying towns. The nearest large urban area is Glasgow some 70km to the

west. The omission of these distant sources is discussed in section 7.

3.3 Nitrogen Oxide Emissions

The N Ox emissions in the model comprises 1x1km data of Edinburgh emissions for a 12x10km

grid in the centre of the 100x100km domain. These data are part of the 1km2 1995 National

Atmospheric Emissions Inventory for 1995 (Salway et al. 1997). Other emission sources -

surrounding towns, large roads and point sources - were ignored as only the eﬀects of Edinburgh

emissions are being examined. All areas outside the city were assumed to have a low, background

N Ox emission.

Traﬃc count data from Edinburgh were used as a proxy for the diurnal variations in N Ox

emissions. Approximately 85% of all N Ox emissions were estimated to come from road traﬃc

in city centres (Lindqvist et al. 1982), the rest was assumed to be emitted by background

sources and were treated as constant throughout the 24 hours. The traﬃc count data used

were from a detailed city-centre traﬃc analysis, held over 16 hours (0600-2200hrs) at 40 sites

in June 1997, and annual average traﬃc counts from seven main arterial routes into and out

of the city, also for 1997. As both the city centre and surrounding arterial roads had similar

Nicholson et. al.

10

diurnal variation, the average of them was used in the model for N Ox emission variations - as

seen in the composite plot in Figure 1. Rural background levels of N Ox emissions (ie. outside

the 10x12km city centre) were spatially constant and varied temporarily in the same way as

the city centre emissions. N Ox emissions are put into the lowest two layers of the model and

a N O : N O2 ratio of 3:1 is assumed.

3.4 Wind Data

The wind data used in these modelling studies were obtained from Turnhouse Airport, situated

8km west of the city centre, and are averages for the period 1970-1991 (ISMCS 1995). These

are 10m winds and are used rather than the local geostrophic wind as they are available in a

detailed statistical form and yet are still representative of airﬂow across the region. The data

include the speed and frequency (without calm conditions) of the wind from diﬀerent directions

for midday and midnight in June and December (see Tables 1 and 2).

4 One-Dimensional Trajectories Through a City

4.1 Method

Straight-line trajectories, featuring rural and urban conditions, were run over 100km to examine

the eﬀect on ozone concentration and the O3/N O/N O2 equilibrium of diﬀerent atmospheric

conditions. Starting with constant vertical concentrations at the upwind boundary, an initial

fetch of 45km over background (rural) landscape allowed the O3/N O/N O2 system to reach

a dynamic equilibrium and a vertical proﬁle to form. The column then passed over 10km

of simulated urban area with a lower deposition velocity from that over the rural area and

(spatially constant) N Ox emissions included. Finally, the trajectory continued for another

45km downwind of the city, again over background rural landscape, to allow the O3/N O/N O2

system to move towards attaining a new balance. The amount to which the ozone concentration

recovered was compared with initial upwind concentrations. The output from the model is the

ozone concentration in the third vertical level (5m) of the column.

4.2 Model Input data

The one dimensional model runs were performed under four diﬀerent ‘extreme’ atmospheric

conditions - summer/winter and day/night - which have large diﬀerences in their values of inso-

lation, wind-speed and atmospheric stability and thus show the range of ozone concentrations

in seasonal and diurnal cycles. As many factors as possible were held constant between the

diﬀerent conditions so as to show which of the many input parameters had the largest inﬂu-

ence on the ozone results. Only the wind-speed, temperature (which has a negligible eﬀect

on ozone concentrations with small variations) and solar insolation values used were diﬀerent

between daytime and nighttime runs in the same season. The ‘summer’ and ‘winter’ and ‘day’

Nicholson et. al.

and ‘night’ conditions used in the modelling studies were based on four sets of meteorological

parameters outlined in Table 4.

Table 4: Input parameters for the model for the simulated seasonal and diurnal trajectories

In each case, the initial concentration values was chosen so that, when run over background

country, the model concentrations were close to the observed average concentrations for those

conditions at Auchencorth Moss - the remote rural site.

The wind-speeds used were those shown in the bottom rows in Tables 1 and 2, ie. the mean of the

midday and midnight values so as to make the daytime and nighttime model runs comparable.

The deposition velocity of ozone and N O2 (N O is not deposited at a signiﬁcant rate) for each

season was calculated by multiplying a seasonal average by a variable factor. At nighttime this

factor had a value of 0.4 while in the daytime it varied according to the zenith angle of the sun

with a greater amplitude in summer than winter. The values of the deposition velocity used in

the model are contained in Table 5 (Brook et al. 1999).

4.3 Results From One-Dimensional Trajectories

Figure 2 shows the concentrations for summer day and summer night trajectories - midday and

midnight of June 15th respectively. At midday in summer, the concentration of ozone drops

from an upwind value of 70µg m−3 to a minimum of 42µg m−3 within the city boundaries.

However, owing to the rapid vertical mixing, once downwind of the city the ozone concentra-

tion quickly recovers again towards 60µg m−3 - the maximum reached before deposition and

chemistry start to reduce the ozone again. This is an overall loss of 10µg m−3 as the air column

crossed the city or about 15% of the upwind concentration. Due to the large amount of N Ox

emitted - the new dynamic equilibrium of the N O/N O2/O3 system has larger concentrations

of both N O and N O2. At night the boundary layer is shallow and stable which causes both

N O and N O2 to accumulate, exceeding 100µg m−3 by the downwind edge of the city. The

ozone within the city is completely destroyed and the N O present close to the surface keeps the

ozone concentration at zero for almost 10km downwind of the city. As there is no photolysis

at night and thus no reforming of N O, once the N O emitted by the city has been used up,

the ozone concentration increases again due to the mixing down of ozone-rich air from aloft.

The stability of the lower atmosphere ensures that this increase is relatively slow: by 30km

downwind the ozone concentration has reached 25µg m−3, approximately 50% of the value on

the upwind edge of the city.

Figure 3 shows two plots equivalent to Figure 2, but for the mid-December instead of June.

From Tables 1 and 2 it can be seen that the average wind-speed is greater in winter than

in summer, meaning mechanical turbulence is greater. In December the incident radiation is

reduced, leading to less convective turbulence (and hence less vertical mixing), and lower rates

of photolysis. There are also lower reaction rates and deposition velocities, but the emission

rates of N Ox from the city are the same.

It can be seen that in the daytime, the greater

Nicholson et. al.

15

wind-speed doesn’t overcome the lower convective turbulence levels and leads to very high N O

and N O2 concentrations in the city and hence less ozone present than in June. Almost all

of the 55µg m−3 of ozone upwind of the city is destroyed while N O concentrations peak at

almost 300µg m−3. The reduced vertical mixing due to greater stability of the boundary layer

in the winter can be seen by the time it takes for the O3/N O/N O2 system to return towards a

new dynamic equilibrium. At 45km downwind, both ozone and N O2 are still increasing as the

destruction of all the N O in the lower layers of the column is slow. The increased wind-speed,

and thus mechanical turbulence, at midnight in December over the June values, together with

lower emissions, keeps the ozone concentration slightly above zero and leads to a more rapid

and complete downwind recovery. As the N O concentration decreases, the ozone concentration

reaches 35µg m−3 by 45km downwind - a 60% recovery on the upwind concentration.

Figure 4 shows the vertical proﬁles of ozone concentration over the lowest 150m of the boundary

layer (ﬁrst 10 levels in the model), taken at three positions along the 100km trajectory. The

proﬁle labelled ‘Upwind’ is taken at the upwind boundary of the city ie. after 45km of rural

emissions and deposition. The ‘City’ proﬁle was taken in the very middle of the city (50km into

the trajectory). It can be seen that in the middle of the city ozone has been depleted from all

levels of the column, but especially from the lowest layers where the concentration is 20µg m−3

less than in the upwind proﬁle. The ‘Downwind’ proﬁle was from 10km downwind of the city.

This proﬁle shows a smaller vertical concentration gradient throughout the column than in the

city, indicating that the ozone concentration has begun to recover near the foot of the column

with the reduction of emissions, but that the ozone depletion has spread vertically upwards to

deplete the higher levels. The proﬁle is almost parallel to the upwind proﬁle with the depletion

being around 12-15µg m−3 throughout the column.

Figure 5 shows how the ozone concentrations under diﬀerent stability conditions depends on

wind-speed. The ozone concentrations were measured in the third level of the model at 10km

Nicholson et. al.

16

upwind (35km into the trajectory) and 10km downwind (65km) under a range of wind-speeds

varying from 0.25 - 10m s−1. For the summer, both upwind and downwind, this diagram shows

the expected pattern - fairly steady concentrations (independent of wind-speed) until the wind

drops below 2m s−1 at which the concentration drops quickly (PORG 1997).

In December,

however, the model shows the concentration being much more dependent on wind-speed over a

larger range ie. mechanical turbulence is more important in winter and so the whole mixing is

dependent on wind-speed and hence so is the concentration.

5 Two-Dimensional Maps of Ozone Concentrations Within and

Around Edinburgh

5.1 Method

In order to simulate the two-dimensional ﬁeld of ozone concentrations around Edinburgh, the

one-dimensional trajectory version of the model has been modiﬁed to run over a 100x100km

grid, with Edinburgh located at the centre. This has been achieved by combining the patterns

from a series of straight-line trajectories, from a variety of angles, so that a picture is drawn up

of the ozone concentration averaged over all directions. The directions of the trajectories are

separated from each other by 15◦, giving 24 directions, each having its own frequency weighting

and wind-speed, taken from the wind-rose data from section 2.4. The model is run at a 1x1km

grid-scale. The ozone concentration recorded at the end of each time-step is added to the total

of the grid-square currently occupied. When the whole domain has been covered from each of

the 24 angles used, the average concentration of each grid-square is calculated by dividing the

sum of the concentrations for that square by the number of time-steps ﬁnishing within it.

The initial N Ox and O3 concentration proﬁles used at the start of each trajectory are calculated

Nicholson et. al.

17

from the 100km summer/winter trajectories from section 3. The concentrations at 20km of

the trajectory over rural land (with no emissions) were used. This allowed the chemistry to

reach a steady-state and vertical concentration proﬁles that are appropriate for the atmospheric

conditions to be created.

5.2 Annual Mean Ozone Plot

The annual mean ozone concentration map shows the eﬀect to which titration of ozone by

nitric oxide has a pronounced eﬀect throughout the year. It was generated by averaging each

pixel output from twelve diﬀerent model runs: midday and midnight for October, December

and February (using the ‘winter’ conditions - ie. wind-rose data and initial concentrations) and

April, June and August (using ‘summer’ conditions) and can be seen in Figure 6.

The output for the annual average ozone concentration at Bush and Auchencorth are in excellent

agreement with the annual average observed ozone concentration for the two sites in 1995-97 -

see Table 6. It should be remembered, however, that Auchencorth values were used to determine

the upwind boundary conditions.

Table 6: Annual average ozone concentrations at the three monitoring sites - both modelled
and observed results

However, at Princes Street the agreement is not nearly so good with the modelled value only

about half the observed average; but the model value is the average concentration over the whole

1x1km grid-square that the monitoring station is in. In reality the concentration varies greatly

across the grid square and the observations may be taken at a site where the concentration is

not representative of the whole area. This is in contrast to the Auchencorth site, where the

Nicholson et. al.

18

uniformity of the landscape and the lack of local sources makes it representative of a large

area. It might though be expected that the observations, particularly at Princes Street, would

be smaller than the modelled results as they are taken within a few metres of the road itself.

The position of the monitoring site though is slightly unusual in that it is positioned within a

garden that is at a lower level than the road. The model treats the entire domain as it it were

ﬂat and is unable to recreate the eﬀects of such topographic detail. However, with the height

of the monitoring inlet being 4m above the surrounding ground, it is almost on the same level

as the adjacent road and thus should still be sampling air that is depleted in ozone. It appears

that the model is under-estimating ozone concentrations within urban areas.

The spatial extent of ozone depletion greater than 5µg m−3 from the background (Auchencorth)

value of 55µg m−3 is fairly limited on an annual-average basis. The 50µg m−3 isopleth extends

only a few kilometres outside the city boundary - reaching a maximum distance of approximately

10km downwind of the dominant wind direction (see Tables 1 and 2), to the north-east. Areas

with concentrations less than 45µg m−3 (a 20% depletion) are mainly conﬁned within the city

boundary and, due to the prevailing wind from the southwest, out over the Firth of Forth to the

north-east. Only an area of approximately 8x8km, just oﬀset from the city centre is depleted

by more than 50%.

6 Modelling Vertical and Temporal Variations in Edinburgh’s

Ozone Concentrations

6.1 Vertical Section of Ozone Concentrations Through Edinburgh

Figure 7 is the 30x30km plot of ozone concentrations for midday in December. The city centre

ozone concentration is less than 5µg m−3 with the Bush and Auchencorth concentrations being

Nicholson et. al.

19

46 and 48µg m−3 respectively. Depletion greater than 20% (ie. less than 35µg m−3) is again

mainly conﬁned to the city and areas to the north and east, out over the Firth of Forth.

Figure 8 is a north-south vertical section (0-150m) through the 1200hrs December ozone con-

centration ﬁeld - passing through Princes Street. Above 100m there is little detail of the city

below that can be seen at all (except for some jagged peaks that are artefacts of the plotting

program used). It can be seen that the section is skewed with lower concentration spread out

towards the north - this can also be seen in the two-dimensional plot (Figure 7). Concentrations

of less than 25µg m−3, ie. 50% depletion, are restricted to below 20m. At nighttime, this would

be even lower - just a few metres above the ground.

6.2 Diurnal Variation of Ozone Concentrations

Diurnal plots of ozone concentrations at Princes Street and Bush for December have been

made by calculating the hourly ozone concentrations for 24 hours. These are plotted in Figure

9 and are compared with observational data obtained from the two monitoring stations (hourly

averages) from 3 years (1995-97). Any day with missing data for any of the species were ignored;

however overall data capture was greater than 90%.

As can be seen from the diurnal variation plot, the values at Bush generated by the model are

closer to the observed average values (as expected due to the deﬁnition of the upwind perimeter

concentrations) than those at Princes Street but the pattern of the diurnal variation produced

by the model at Princes Street more closely resembles the observations, despite a systematic

under-estimation of 10-20µg m−3.

At Princes Street, the only feature of the modelled variation that doesn’t correspond well with

the observed values is in the middle of the day when there is a peak in the concentration from

the minima during the dawn and dusk rush hours. This is due to the increased mixing in the

Nicholson et. al.

20

day in the model from the increased insolation. The reason that the modelled values are on

average 10µg m−3 less than those observed may be due to one or more of several reasons:

• The emission used in the model may not be appropriate for the locality.

• Vertical mixing may be underestimated. No account is taken of the heat island eﬀect.

• It is likely that the complex mixing processes taking place within the street canyons are

not adequately represented.

• Mixing depends on stability, which is determined only by external conditions (cloud cover

and wind speed) at the time. There is no ”memory” of preceeding conditions.

The observed values at Bush are lower than those produced by the model and show that this

site is also inﬂuenced by the Edinburgh rush hour. There are two roads within 500m of the

site that carry substantial traﬃc into and out of the city in the morning and evening and the

corresponding dips in the ozone concentration at 0900 and 1700hours can be attributed to this.

There appears to be a discontinuity in the modelled data in the very middle of the day, where

the concentration dips instead of rising to a small peak at midday as happens at Princes Street.

This may be due to the ozone deposition velocity during the day over rural areas reaching such

a value that depletion of ozone at the surface exceeds the mixing down of ozone rich air from

aloft. The small deposition velocity and greater mechanical turbulence over the city ensure

that this does not occur at the Prices Street site.

7 Conclusions

The Lagrangian column model has been used in this study to produce a series of one- and two-

dimensional maps of surface ozone concentrations under a variety of meteorological conditions.

Nicholson et. al.

21

One-dimensional straight-line trajectories under average summertime boundary-layer conditions

show a depletion of surface ozone over an urban area of 40% in daytime with a downwind

recovery to approximately 80% of upwind rural values at 20km and 100% depletion with an

eventual recovery to 50% downwind at night. Similar trajectories run in winter, with lower

insolation levels and greater mean wind-speeds show 90% of the surface ozone is depleted in

both daytime and nighttime conditions. At nighttime, the downwind recovery to 60% of the

upwind concentration is faster than the daytime recovery.

Vertical proﬁles upwind, within and downwind of the city show how the concentration gradient

in the lowest 150m increases as the column passes over the city and then decreases again

downwind as the loss of ozone is evenly spread through the layers. The upwind and downwind

proﬁles have very similar shapes - at midday in June the diﬀerence between the two proﬁles is

approximately 12µg m−3 throughout the proﬁle. A vertical section through the simulated city

for December shows that 50% depletion is restricted to the lowest 20m of the vertical column

and that at 100m altitude, the eﬀects of the city on ozone concentrations are barely discernible.

Two-dimensional maps of annual mean surface ozone concentrations show that the depletion

of ozone by a city is restricted to very close to the urban area. A depletion of 20% of the

background ozone in a simulated Edinburgh only extends beyond the city boundaries downwind

of the prevailing wind direction while 50% depletion is completely conﬁned within the city

boundaries.

At this stage we can revisit the omission of ozone generation from the model formulation.

Typical gradients of ozone concentration around the city boundary are 20-30µg m−3 per 5km

(see Fig. 6). Observations of ozone generation rates are typically at least an order of magnitude

less than this (e.g.

(Weston et al. 1989)), so that patterns of concentration would not be

signiﬁcantly aﬀected by its inclusion.

Nicholson et. al.

22

The diurnal cycle of ozone concentrations at urban and rural sites has been compared with

monitoring site data. The model recreates the shape of the diurnal cycle well - but consistently

underestimates the city-centre surface concentrations. This could be due to underestimat-

ing atmospheric turbulence, overestimating emissions or the fact that the single point of the

monitoring station does not accurately represent the full 1x1km grid-square. The model also

overestimates the concentrations at the rural site, which is more dependent on the emissions

from local roads than used in the model.

ABSTRACT

The observed correlation between global low cloud amount and the ﬂux

of high energy cosmic-rays supports the idea that ionization plays a crucial

role in tropospheric cloud formation. We explore this idea quantitatively

with a simple model of cosmic-ray ionization enhancement of the formation of

cloud condensation nuclei. This model predicts that solar modulation of the

cosmic-ray ionization rate should be correlated with cloud opacity where the

atmospheric aerosol concentration is low. Using the International Satellite Cloud

Climatology Project database (1983-1993), we ﬁnd that the mean opacity of low

latitude (< 40◦) clouds does indeed show a correlation with the variations in

cosmic-ray ﬂux, and that the observed opacity variations increase with altitude

in accordance with the model. We also ﬁnd that the higher latitude (> 40◦)

clouds, on the other hand, show an anti-correlation with cosmic-ray ﬂux, which

we suggest may be a feedback eﬀect resulting from the thicker low latitude

clouds. We also show that the previously reported correlations of cloud amount

with cosmic-ray ﬂux probably result from the variations in longwave emissivity

expected from our model, and not from variations in cloud amount. Further

global cloud observations by missions such as Triana are needed to better study

the apparent variations of cloud opacity with cosmic-ray ionization rate and

solar activity.

Introduction

The primary source of energy for the Earth’s atmosphere is the Sun, so it is reasonable

to explore whether changes in the global climate result from solar variability. It was ﬁrst

suggested by the astronomer William Herschel (Herschel 1801) that variations in the solar

irradiance caused by sunspots could lead to climatic changes on Earth, and he cited the

variation of British wheat prices with sunspot number as evidence for this link. The

occurrence of the “Little Ice Age” during the 1645-1715 Maunder sunspot minimum (Eddy

1976), the correlation between the long-term solar cycle variations and tropical sea surface

temperatures (Reid 1987), polar stratospheric temperatures (Labitske 1987), and the width

of tree rings (Zhou and Butler 1998), along with many other studies also support a link

between solar variations and the Earth’s climate.

A direct link between the Sun and these phenomena is tenuous, however, because the

magnitude of the solar irradiance variation over the 11-year solar cycle is very small. Over

the 1979-1990 solar cycle, for example, the variation in the irradiance was only ∼ 0.1%

(Fr¨ohlich 2000), or ∼ 0.3 W m−2 globally-averaged at the top of the atmosphere. This is

insuﬃcient to power the sea surface temperature changes associated with the solar cycle by

a factor of 3 − 5 (Lean 1997), and is signiﬁcantly smaller than the globally-averaged forcings

due to clouds (∼ 28 W m−2; e.g. Hartmann 1993) anthropogenic greenhouse gases (∼ 2 W

m−2; Wigley and Raper 1992) and anthropogenic aerosols (∼ 0.3 − 2.0 W m−2; Charlson

et al. 1992; Kiehl and Briegleb 1993), suggesting that any direct atmospheric forcing from

solar irradiance variations would be relatively unimportant.

An indirect link between solar cycle variations and the Earth’s climate appears more

likely, especially given the discovery of a link between the ﬂux of Galactic cosmic-rays

(GCRs) and global cloudiness (Svensmark and Friis-Christensen 1997) in the ISCCP cloud

database (Rossow and Schiﬀer 1991). The Sun modulates the GCR ﬂux at the Earth

– 4 –

through the action of the solar wind, which scatters and attenuates the GCRs in times of

heightened solar activity (solar maximum; e.g. Jokipii 1971). Using 3.7 micron near infrared

(NIR) cloud amounts from an updated version of the ISCCP database (Rossow et al.

1996), Marsh and Svensmark (2000) and Pall´e Bag´o and Butler (2000) showed that there is

evidence of a GCR-cloud correlation only for low (< 3 km) clouds, and that the eﬀect of the

cosmic-rays on global cloud amount appears to be greatest at the low to mid latitudes. The

globally-averaged forcing due to the increase in low clouds associated with the solar cycle

GCR variations is estimated (Kirkby and Laaksonen 2000) to be approximately −1.2 W

m−2, which is suﬃcient to power the sea surface temperature variations (Lean 1997). This

is also comparable in magnitude (but opposite in sign) to the forcing due to anthropogenic

CO2 emission over the last century (Kirkby and Laaksonen 2000). Decreasing local cloud

amounts correlated with short-term Forbush decreases in cosmic-ray rates were observed by

Pudovkin and Veretenko (1995).

The reality of the GCR-cloud connection has been questioned by a number of authors

(Kernthaler, Toumi, and Haigh 1999; Jorgensen and Hansen 2000; Norris 2000). These

objection can be distilled into three main points: 1) The GCR-cloud correlation should be

seen prominently in high (cirrus) clouds at high latitudes where the cosmic-ray intensity is

highest, 2) the increased cloudiness can be more plausibly attributed to other phenomena

instead of GCRs, and 3) the correlation is an artifact of the ISCCP analysis. As discussed

below, the ﬁrst objection is addressed by the theory of ion-mediated nucleation (Yu

and Turco 2001), in which the key parameter governing the eﬃciency of the cosmic-ray

interaction is the relative numbers of ions and aerosols in the cloud forming region. The

second objection lacks merit when one compares the temporal proﬁles of the GCR-cloud

correlation with with the proﬁles of the dominant volcanic and El Ni˜no events during the

same time period (Kirkby and Laaksonen 2000). Finally, the ISCCP artifacts pointed out

by Norris (2000) are troubling, but it is not clear that they are of suﬃcient magnitude to

– 5 –

produce the observed GCR-cloud correlation, and it doesn’t explain why the correlation

exists only for low clouds and not the other cloud types in the ISCCP database.

The linkage between cosmic-rays and cloud formation has been recently investigated

by a number of authors (Yu and Turco 2001; Tinsley 2000 and references therein). Here

we extend this work, considering the eﬀects of variations in the cosmic-ray rate on the

microphysical properties of clouds, and proposing a simple, quantitative model in which the

cosmic-rays enhance the formation of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). We show that such

a model predicts observable consequences in a quantiﬁable increase in mean cloud opacity,

or optical thickness, with increasing cosmic-ray rate. Our model calculations also suggest

that the observed solar cycle variations in infrared cloud amounts result primarily from

cloud emissivity variations and not variations in cloud amount.

The paper is organized as follows. In the next section we discuss how cosmic-rays

could alter the optical thickness and emissivity of clouds by aﬀecting the underlying

nucleation process. The search for cloud opacity variations using the ISCCP database and

its correlation with cosmic-ray ﬂux variations are discussed in Section 3. Finally we discuss

and summarize our results in Section 4.

2. Eﬀects of GCRs on Cloud Properties

2.1. Nucleation

Cosmic rays form water droplets in the supersaturated air of a classical cloud chamber

(Wilson 1901), and it seems plausible that they could also play a signiﬁcant role in natural

cloud formation. Yu and Turco (2000, 2001) have investigated the formation of CCN

from charged molecular clusters formed from cosmic-ray ionization, and they ﬁnd that the

– 6 –

charged clusters grow more rapidly and are more stable than their neutral counterparts.

This “ion-mediated” nucleation results in larger aerosol particles and more CCN for a

given supersaturation. One would therefore expect an increase in the number of CCN with

increasing cosmic-ray rate.

To quantify this eﬀect, we envision the two idealized scenarios depicted in Figure 1.

In both cloud formation scenarios, the increase in the ionizing cosmic-ray ﬂux causes a

corresponding increase in the number of cloud condensation nuclei through the process

of ion-mediated nucleation. In these scenarios we make the simplifying assumption that

changes in the ionization rate can be approximated as local perturbations in an otherwise

constant overall system and we ignore any feedback eﬀects. In the ﬁrst case we assume

that the nucleation of cloud droplets is limited by the available amount of water in the

supersaturated air, so that liquid water content (LWC), or density of water in droplets, is

constant. Therefore the amount of water per droplet will be less and the cloud droplet radii

smaller at higher cosmic-ray ionization rates, e.g. solar minimum, than at lower rates, e.g.

solar maximum. This is analogous to the “Twomey Eﬀect” of enhanced aerosol pollution

on droplet size distributions and the albedo of clouds (Twomey 1977; Rosenfeld 2000), and

would primarily occur in environments where the amount of water in the air (and not the

number of CCN) is the limiting factor. Thus we would expect the eﬀective radius Ref f of

the cloud droplet distribution resulting from a small fractional increase, η = ∆q/q0, in the

cosmic-ray ionization rate in any particular volume of air will be

Ref f = (1 + ηf )

−1/3

R0

ef f ,

(1)

where f is the eﬃciency of the conversion of a change in cosmic-ray ionization rate to a

change in the number of cloud condensation nuclei, which we discuss below, and R0

ef f is the

original eﬀective radius of the droplet distribution.

In the second case in Figure 1, we assume that the additional CCN resulting from

– 7 –

the increased cosmic-ray ionization cause a proportionate increase in the amount of water

extracted from the supersaturated air, with the eﬀective radius of the droplet cloud droplet

distribution remaining constant. This is the case where the formation of the cloud is limited

by the local availability of CCN and not condensible water. This eﬀect has been seen in the

marine boundary layer in ship track clouds (Conover 1966), which have higher reﬂectivities

(Coakley, Bernstein, and Durkee 1987) and liquid water contents (Radke, Coakley, and

King 1989) due to the formation of additional CCN from ship exhaust. The liquid water

content of a cloud in any particular volume of air will then be given by

LWC = (1 + ηf)LWC0.

(2)

These two scenarios probably represent extremes of the cosmic-ray eﬀect on the clouds. As

in the ship track clouds, the eﬀect of the GCRs will probably be a combination of both

LWC changes and Ref f changes, with the magnitude of the eﬀect being bounded by the

changes given in (1) and (2).

2.2. Radiative Properties

Both an increase in the cloud liquid water content and a decrease in eﬀective droplet

radius, associated with the increased cosmic-ray ionization, will result in a net increase in

cloud optical thicknesses. The optical thickness τ of a uniform cloud layer of thickness ∆z

is given by (van den Hulst 1981):

where n(r)dr is the concentration of cloud droplets with radii between r and r + dr, Qext is

the Mie extinction eﬃciency, and it is commonly assumed that

τ = ∆z

which is a good approximation when 2πr/λ >> 1, where λ is the wavelength (Stephens

1984).

The eﬀective radius of the cloud droplet distribution is given by

and the cloud liquid water content is given by

where ρ is the density of liquid water. Combining these equations, we see that

(7)

Thus from (7) we would expect that both a decrease in the mean Ref f and an increase in

the mean LWC from increased cosmic-ray ionization should increase the mean opacity of

clouds at solar minimum relative to solar maximum.

At visible wavelengths from space, the primary consequence of the change in cloud

opacity associated with cosmic-rays will be an increase in cloud reﬂectivity, or albedo. To

investigate this, we use the radiative transfer code SBDART (Ricchiazzi, Yang, and Gautier

1998) to calculate the top of the atmosphere broadband (0.25 − 4.00µm) upward ﬂux for

three uniform low cloud models: 1) a 1 km thick cloud layer extending to a height of 2 km,

2) a 2 km thick cloud extending to a height of 3 km, and 3) a 0.5 km cloud layer extending

to 1.5 km. These simulations were done with a tropical atmosphere proﬁle (McClatchey et

al. 1972) and an ocean surface albedo. The fractional increases in albedo resulting from a

10% increase in cosmic-ray ionization, i.e. η = 0.1, which is of the order of the measured

increase going from solar maximum to solar minimum, is shown in Figure 2 with f = 1 in

the 1 km thick cloud, for a wide range of LWC and Ref f in the variable LWC case (top

panel) and the variable Ref f case (bottom panel). In both cases the contours of changing

albedo approximately parallel the change in optical thickness calculated assuming Qext = 2.

– 9 –

Figure 3 shows the fractional change in albedo directly as a function of opacity for

all three cloud models. This ﬁgure clearly shows that the change in albedo is largest for

clouds with opacities τ between 1 and 10, but is roughly independent of cloud geometrical

thickness. Figures 2 and 3 indicate that the change in cloud optical thickness can be used

to quantify the eﬀects of the cosmic-rays on cloud optical properties. Although the change

in albedo due to the cosmic-rays is only ∼ 0.2 − 0.5%, this can produce a very signiﬁcant

negative forcing per cloud of ∼ 6 − 14 W m−2 at the top of the atmosphere for a solar zenith

angle of 40◦. The modulation of cloud opacity due to cosmic rays could therefore produce a

similar modulation of the Earth’s energy budget over the 11 year solar cycle, although the

exact amount of forcing will depend sensitively on cloud amount variations as well as cloud

opacity variations.

Because of the relationship between cloud opacity and emissivity, the cosmic-rays

should also produce an observable eﬀect on cloud emission at infrared (IR) and near infrared

wavelengths. The eﬀective IR/NIR emissivity ǫ can be parameterized by a relation of the

form (Stephens 1978):

ǫ = 1 − exp(−a0LWC ∆z),

(8)

where a0 is the mass absorption coeﬃcient. Empirical ﬁts to IR emission from water clouds

yields a0 = 0.130 (Stephens 1978. As seen in (7), the exponent in (8) is proportional to

the cloud optical thickness for a given droplet eﬀective radius, so the infrared emissivity

increases with cloud opacity, with the change being most noticeable for optically thin

clouds. Therefore one would expect increased longwave emission, along with the primary

eﬀect of increased visible albedo, from clouds at solar minimum relative to clouds at solar

maximum.

2.3. The Eﬃciency Factor

– 10 –

The eﬃciency factor f parameterizes the eﬀectiveness of the cosmic rays and ionization

in producing cloud condensation nuclei. Using the results of Yu and Turco (2001), we

postulate an eﬃciency factor of the form

f =

1 +

(cid:18)

−1

,

na
xni (cid:19)

(9)

where ni and na are the densities of ions and background aerosols, respectively, and x ≈ 10

is the factor by which ionized particles are favored over neutrals in the formation of CCN

through enhanced stability and more rapid growth of charged molecular clusters versus

neutral clusters (Yu and Turco 2000; Yu and Turco 2001). The form of (9) ensures that the

cosmic-ray eﬃciency is low when the formation of CCN is dominated by neutral aerosols,

and it assumes that all of the ionization is due to GCRs, which is a good assumption over

oceans and at heights greater than ∼ 1 km over all regions (Hoppel, Anderson, and Willet

1986).

Since the timescale for the changes in the solar cycle GCR ﬂux is on the order of years,

we can eliminate ni from (9) by assuming ionization equilibrium. Given an ion production

rate q, the equation of ionization balance is

dni
dt

= q − αn2

i − βnina,

(10)

where α is the recombination coeﬃcient and β is the eﬀective attachment coeﬃcient of ions

to background aerosol particles. Typical tropospheric values for both the coeﬃcients are

∼ 3 × 10−6 cm3 s−1 (Smith and Church 1977; Hoppel 1985), and the ionization rate from

cosmic rays is q ∼ 2 ion pairs cm−3 s−1 near the surface and increases with height and

geomagnetic latitude to a peak value of q ≥ 50 at a height of ∼ 14 km over the geomagnetic

poles (Neher 1961, 1967; Reiter 1992).

Assuming dni/dt = 0, the equilibrium ion density can be found and the eﬃciency f can

be expressed in terms of na and the ionization rate q. This yields an equilibrium eﬃciency

(11)

(12)

where

Using the values of α and β mentioned above and x = 10 (Yu and Turco 2000), the eﬃciency

is plotted in Figure 4 for q = 2 − 40. This ﬁgure shows that the eﬃciency of the GCR

eﬀect decreases rapidly with increasing background aerosol density and decreasing GCR

ionization rate. Since the cosmic-ray eﬃciency depends on the ratio of q/n2

a, we also see

that it depends more strongly on the aerosol background than on the cosmic-ray ionization

rate. This implies that the cosmic-ray eﬀect would be most apparent over oceans where

the background aerosol is relatively small (Twomey and Wojciechowski 1969), and at high

altitudes where the ionization rate due to cosmic-rays is highest.

3. Cloud Opacity Variations

3.1.

ISCCP Data

To search for changes in cloud optical properties consistent with cosmic ray eﬀects, we

used the International Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) monthly gridded cloud products

(“D2”) datasets, a compilation of cloud properties derived from satellite observations during

the period 1983–1993 (Rossow et al. 1996). The ISCCP D2 data used here consists of mean

cloud amount fractions and visible optical depths, as a function of time, for 6596 “boxes”

with equal area covering the entire surface of the Earth. For a given time, the cloud amount

fraction in each box is deﬁned as the number of cloudy satellite image pixels, as determined

– 12 –

by a cloud detection algorithm, divided by the total number of pixels in the box. The

cloud optical thicknesses are derived from the visible satellite cloud albedos by using a

radiative transfer model and assuming spherical droplets with droplet size distribution n(r)

characterized by a gamma distribution with variance 0.15 and Ref f = 10 µm. ISCCP cloud

top temperatures are simultaneously determined from the 3.7µm NIR radiances, allowing

for determination of cloud altitude and pressure, and the low, mid-level, and high clouds

are deﬁned as having cloud top pressures P > 680 mb, 440 < P < 680 mb, and P < 440

mb, respectively. Because we require the simultaneous visible and near infrared radiances

for our analysis, we only use the ISCCP daytime data. This is a diﬀerent dataset than the

diurnal NIR data used for the cloud amount analyses of Marsh and Svensmark (2000) and

Pall´e Bag´o and Butler (2000), and we discuss these diﬀerences below.

Unfortunately, detailed information on the distribution of cloud optical thicknesses is

not preserved in the the ISCCP D2 database, and instead the mean optical thickness ¯τ is

recorded for three broad ¯τ bands: 0.0 − 3.6, 3.6 − 23.0, and 23.0 − 379.0. Thus a detailed

analysis of the change in τ over the solar cycle is not possible using the D2 data, but a

value of the weighted mean cloud optical thickness <¯τ> can be calculated using

<¯τ>=

P
where the ¯Ai are the total cloud amount fractions within each of the broad ISCCP optical
P

thickness bins mentioned above. We calculated <¯τ> separately for the three cloud levels

and for two latitude bands with |φ| ≤ 40.0◦ (low latitude) and |φ| > 40◦ (high latitude).

(13)

3.2. Cosmic Ray Data

For comparison with the cloud data, it is necessary to obtain a measure of the mean

variation in the cosmic-ray ionization rate appropriate for the various latitude and altitude

– 13 –

bands of the cloud data. This is not a trivial task for a variety of reasons. Cosmic rays are

commonly detected by neutron monitors, which detect the secondary neutrons produced

by the interactions of the cosmic rays with the atmosphere. Since the primary cosmic-rays

are charged, the geomagnetic ﬁeld excludes varying amounts of cosmic-rays as a function of

geomagnetic latitude, such that higher GCR ﬂuxes are seen at higher geomagnetic latitudes.

In addition, the ﬂux of secondary particles increases with height in the atmosphere as

the amount of absorbing gas overhead decreases. Finally, the lifetimes of ionized aerosol

particles and cloud condensation nuclei in the atmosphere depends on their size and reach

maximum values of ∼ 10 − 100 days for particle radii of ∼ 0.1 − 1.0 µm (Pruppacher and

Klett 1997). This is long enough so that even at a wind speed of 20 mph the CCN can

move more than 5000 miles; therefore signiﬁcant transport and mixing of ionized aerosols

could occur between regions of high and low cosmic-ray ﬂuxes – smoothing the latitude

dependence of any cosmic-ray signature on cloud properties.

In light of these complications, to analyze the cloud opacity variations we simply use

the cosmic-ray rate from the Climax, Colorado neutron monitor run by the University of

Chicago (obtained from http://ulysses.uchicago.edu/NeutronMonitor/neutron mon.html),

scaled in latitude and height using the balloon data of Neher (1961,1967), to derive

appropriate ionization rates for calculating the cosmic-ray eﬃciency factor. Using the

period 1986.0–1988.0 for solar minimum and 1990.0–1992.0 for solar maximum, we derive

η = (CRmin − CRmax)/CRmax = 20.5% for the Climax station, which is at an altitude of 3.4

km and a latitude of 39◦ (∼ 50◦ geomagnetic). Here CR denotes the cosmic-ray neutron

monitor rate. By way of comparison, the minimum variation in CR over the solar cycle was

∼ 14%, measured at the Huancayo station at the same altitude, but at a latitude of 12◦ S

on the geomagnetic equator.

Besides encompassing the maximum and minimum cosmic-ray rates in the available

– 14 –

cloud data, these temporal intervals were chosen to minimize El Ni˜no eﬀects that could bias

the ISCCP data. Using the intervals mentioned above, both the solar minimum and solar

maximum are characterized by El Ni˜no conditions with similar Southern Oscillation Indices

(Rasmusson and Carpenter 1982) of -7.9 and -5.7, respectively, so the relative diﬀerences

due to El Ni˜no should be small.

3.3. A Low Latitude Cloud Opacity–Cosmic Ray Correlation

The mean optical thicknesses < ¯τ > as a function of time for the low latitude

clouds are shown, along with the Climax cosmic-ray rate, in Figure 5. All of the data

has been smoothed with a 2 year sliding boxcar ﬁlter with the endpoints unsmoothed.

We see that the variation of < ¯τ > at all heights is nonrandom with respect to the

cosmic-ray variations, with a distinct correlation for low latitude clouds, as predicted by

our model. Using the intervals 1986.0–1988.0 and 1990.0-1992.0 for solar minimum and

solar maximum, respectively, we calculate the fractional change in mean optical thickness

δ <¯τ >/<¯τmax>= (<¯τmin>–<¯τmax>)/<¯τmax> for the low latitude clouds and the linear

Pearson correlation coeﬃcient in Table 1. The data shows that the low latitude cloud

optical thicknesses are positively correlated with the cosmic-ray rate for all cloud heights,

with correlations coeﬃcients ranging from c = 0.58 to c = 0.77. The fractional change

in optical thickness increases with cloud altitude, as also predicted by our model, with a

maximum of 26% for high clouds and a minimum of ∼ 3% for low clouds.

The variation of cloud optical thicknesses with cosmic-ray rate in the low latitude

clouds can be used to constrain the background aerosol density in our model. We

use the cosmic-ray ionization rates found by Neher (1961,1967) to scale the 1984-1993

mean fractional change in solar cycle cosmic-rays from the Climax neutron counter to

– 15 –

the representative cloud heights of the low, mid-level, and high ISCCP cloud heights.

The Neher ionization rates give a relation between η and atmospheric pressure that is

approximately linear over the pressure range 200 − 500 mb (the Neher data is only for

P < 500 mb), and we derive scaled Climax 1984-1993 solar maximum to solar minimum η

values of 0.20, 0.28, and 0.37, assuming heights of 1.5, 4.5, and 10.0 km, or mean pressures

of 840, 560, and 240 mb, for the low, mid-level, and high ISCCP clouds respectively. Using

the data of Neher (1967) from the solar minimum year of 1965, we also derive cosmic-ray

ionization rates at solar maximum of q ∼ 3, 10, and 32 ion pairs cm3 s−1 for the three cloud

layers in order of increasing height [the values of q were obtained by analytical ﬁts to the

1965 solar maximum data of Neher (1967)]. As shown in Table 2, the inferred mean values

of the background aerosol density na, using (11) and (12), are reasonable but not terribly
constraining; more ionization data at pressures P > 500 mb and latitudes |φ| < 30◦ are

needed to constrain the model.

3.4. High Latitude Opacity Variations

The variation of the mean high latitude (> 40◦) cloud optical thickness over the

1984-1993 interval of the ISCCP data is shown in Figure 6. The temporal behavior of the

mean high latitude cloud optical thickness is roughly anti-correlated with the cosmic-ray

ﬂux, which is opposite of the behavior seen in the low latitude clouds. This seems to be

in contradiction to our model, but the high latitude variations can be attributed to a

feedback eﬀect arising from the cloud variations in the low latitude regions. Global climate

simulations (Chen and Ramaswamy 1996) indicate that global cloud albedo-increasing

perturbations – similar to the changes induced by cosmic-rays – decrease the poleward

transport of moisture from the tropics, which could thus produce the negative correlation

between cosmic-rays and high latitude cloud optical thicknesses seen in the ISCCP data.

– 16 –

This is further supported by the fact that the high latitude anti-correlation is greatest for

low clouds and decreases with height – consistent with the distribution of tropospheric

water and opposite to the altitude trend seen in the low latitude data. Whatever the

reason for the changes in the high latitude clouds, radiative forcings from low latitude

cloud changes (e.g. Kirkby and Laaksonen 2000) clearly dominate over high latitude cloud

forcings with respect to the Earth’s energy budget, due to the larger projected area and

mean solar zenith angle of the low latitude region.

3.5. Cloud Opacity vs. Cloud Amount

The optical thicknesses of the low latitude clouds in the ISCCP database are clearly

correlated with the ﬂux of high energy cosmic-rays as illustrated in Figure 5. The fractional

increase in optical thickness is greatest at high altitudes - consistent with the simple model

for the cosmic-ray/cloud interaction discussed in Section 2. The magnitude of the eﬀect is

as high as 26% for high altitude, low latitude clouds. On the other hand, in the low altitude

clouds, the variation is just ∼ 3%, which is quite comparable to the < 5% variation in cloud

amount derived for low clouds using the ISCCP near infrared data (Marsh and Svensmark

2000; Pall´e Bag´o and Butler 2000). As discussed in Section 2.2., a correlation between the

cosmic-ray rate and the IR/NIR cloud emissivity is predicted by our model, and an increase

in emissivity would increase the detectability of a given cloud by the ISCCP satellites.

Thus we suggest that the NIR cloud amount variations are due primarily to the

variations in the cloud emissivity resulting from cloud optical thickness variations, as

expected in our model, and not to changes in cloud amount. This can be seen by comparing

Figures 7 and 8, which show the solar cycle variations in global cloud amount fraction

derived from the near infrared ISCCP data in contrast to the variations in global cloud

– 17 –

amounts derived from the visible ISCCP cloud data, which are not as strongly dependent

on the opacity as NIR emission. Like the low latitude visible cloud opacities (Figure 5),

the low cloud amount fraction from NIR emission (Figure 7) shows a distinct positive

correlation with cosmic-ray rate (Marsh and Svensmark 2000; Pall´e Bag´o and Butler 2000),

while Figure 8 shows that there is no obvious positive correlation between cosmic-ray rate

and visible cloud amount for any ISCCP clouds. This strongly suggests that the correlation

between NIR cloud amount fraction and cosmic-ray rate is due to changes in cloud optical

thickness and emissivity, as expected in our model, and not to changes in cloud area.

Curiously, the mid-level global NIR cloud amounts appear to be anticorrelated with cosmic

ray rate in Figure 7. Although the magnitude of the mid-level cloud variation is only half

that of the low cloud NIR variation, the anticorrelation with cosmic ray rate could be due

to an additional feedback mechanism similar to the one discussed in Section 3.4.

The lack of strong positive correlations between the NIR cloud amount fraction

and cosmic ray rate for medium and high level clouds can easily be explained by our

model. Using (8), the change in infrared emissivity ∆ǫ(τ ) = τ dǫ/dτ due to a change in

opacity τ is shown in Figure 9, along with the change in visible upward ﬂux (or albedo)

∆F (τ ) = τ dF/dτ calculated using SBDART and assuming a 1 km thick water cloud

with Ref f = 10µm. Both curves in Figure 9 have been arbitrarily normalized to facilitate

comparison. The ﬁgure shows that the change in infrared emissivity with increasing cloud

opacity in our model should be most noticeable for clouds with τ ∼ 1, whereas the change in

cloud reﬂectivity with opacity peaks at τ ∼ 10 − 20. Since the low clouds have the smallest

mean opacity of all the cloud levels (Figures 5 and 6), we would expect the modulation of

longwave cloud emission by cosmic rays to be primarily observable in the low clouds, which

is what is seen in the ISCCP data.

4. Summary

Here we consider a model in which galactic cosmic rays enhance the formation of cloud

condensation nuclei through the process of ion-mediated nucleation. This should lead to

an increase in mean cloud optical thickness through increased condensation and decreased

droplet eﬀective radius. The main observational consequence of our model is an increase

in mean cloud reﬂectivity, with a secondary eﬀect being an increase in infrared emittance

for optically thin clouds due to the relationship between cloud emissivity and opacity.

Assuming ionization equilibrium, we ﬁnd that the eﬃciency of the cosmic-ray eﬀect depends

sensitively on the density of background aerosols, and should be a maximum in regions of

high cosmic ray ionization rates and low aerosol particle densities, where the role of ions is

most important in the formation of cloud condensation nuclei.

Using the global ISCCP cloud database, we ﬁnd that the optical thicknesses of low

latitude clouds in the visible are correlated with cosmic-ray ﬂux in support of our model.

The magnitude of the opacity variations associated with the cosmic-rays increase with

height, also in support of our model, but the expected increase of the eﬀect with latitude is

not seen – possibly due to a feedback eﬀect from the increased opacity of the low latitude

clouds. The magnitude of the low latitude opacity variation associated with the cosmic rays

exceeds that of the low cloud solar cycle anomalies seen previously by others in the near

infrared, supporting the view that the IR cloud amount variations may be a consequence of

the change in longwave emissivity resulting from the optical thickness variations.

Clearly more theoretical and observational work is needed to conﬁrm the cloud optical

depth variations seen in the ISCCP data. Theoretically, it remains to be seen whether the

anticorrelations between cloud opacity and NIR amount fraction seen in the ISCCP data

can be explained by feedback mechanisms in the context of a self-consistent global climate

model. Observationally, the ISCCP data required the culling together and normalizing of

– 19 –

many disparate satellite datasets (Rossow and Schiﬀer 1991), and although this approach

is necessary at the present time it is not ideal. A needed compliment to the ISCCP global

cloud data would be provided by the NASA deep space mission Triana, which would be

able to retrieve cloud optical thicknesses simultaneously over the entire sunlit Earth from

the L1 Lagrangian point between the Earth and the Sun. Continuous deep space observing

of Earth’s clouds would be ideal for detecting not only the solar cycle variations seen here

but also the the shorter duration but possibly more frequent variations in global cloud cover

associated with Forbush decreases of galactic cosmic rays (Pudovkin and Veretenenko 1995)

and high energy solar proton events from the Sun (Jokipii 1971).

Fig. 9.— The changes in infrared cloud emissivity and visible cloud albedo as functions of the

cloud optical thickness. The eﬀective emissivity for the infrared was based on the empirical

ﬁts of Stephens (1978) to water cloud data, and the variation of cloud albedo or upward ﬂux

in the visible is from a radiative transfer calculation assuming a 1 km thick cloud layer (both

calculations assume Ref f = 10µm for the cloud droplet distribution). These changes are

weighted by the optical thickness, τ , in order to compare the eﬀect of a constant fractional

change in τ . The change in infrared emissivity peaks at lower optical thicknesses than the

change in visible albedo, indicating that the IR cloud changes associated with the varying

cosmic ray ﬂux should be only visible in the thinnest clouds.

Abstract

Localized rain events have been found to follow power-law distribu-
tions over several decades, suggesting parallels between precipitation
and seismic activity [O. Peters et al., PRL 88, 018701 (2002)]. Similar
power laws can be generated by treating raindrops as passive tracers
advected by the velocity ﬁeld of a two-dimensional system of point
vortices [R. Dickman, PRL 90, 108701 (2003)]. Here I review observa-
tional and theoretical aspects of fractal rain distributions and chaotic
advection, and present new results on tracer distributions in the vortex
model.

I. INTRODUCTION

Complex systems often exhibit fractal or power-law scaling; Earth’s atmosphere
is no exception. Fractal rain distributions have been known for at least two decades
[1–3], while recent analyses indicate that durations of dry intervals, and the size of
rain events, follow power laws [4,5]. The similarity between the latter observations
and scaling laws in seismic activity suggests a parallel between rain and earthquakes,
and a possible connection with the phenomenon of self-organized criticality [5,6].

Atmospheric motion is turbulent, particularly in the vicinity of storms, and
various aspects of turbulent ﬂow follow power laws over many orders of magnitude
[7–9]. Even in the absence of fully developed turbulence, unsteady ﬂow may stretch
and fold an initially compact region, leading to a highly convoluted, nonuniform
density of suspended particles or droplets [10–12] via chaotic advection [13,14]. In
light of these observations, it is interesting to develop a model in which rain is an
ideal passive tracer [15,16]. In [17] it was shown that such a model is capable of
producing power-law-distributed event sizes and durations.

In this paper I review some of the evidence for fractal rain distributions, and
present new results on the spatial distribution of tracers in the vortex model.
Progress in ﬂuid mechanics depends heavily on numerical solution of the equations of
motion, which in turn represents one of the most challenging areas in computational
physics, the theme of the present number.

In Sec. II, I survey observations of fractal rain distributions. Sec. III contains
a brief discussion of SOC-like approaches, while Sec. IV reviews results on tracer-
particle dynamics in a ﬂuid undergoing chaotic advection. I deﬁne the vortex model
in Sec. V, which also includes a summary of previous ﬁndings and some recent
extensions. Sec. VI presents new results on spatial distributions of tracers in the
vortex model. The paper closes in Sec. VII with a summary and discussion of open
questions.

II. FRACTAL RAIN DISTRIBUTIONS

Discussions of fractal rain distributions go back at least to the work of Lovejoy
and Mandelbrot [1] who presented a model with a single fractal dimension. The
distribution in question involves a time series of duration T and a ﬁxed observation
point or station. The observation interval is partitioned into N = T /τ subintervals
of duration τ , each characterized as rainy (a nonzero amount of rain is detected at
the station in this interval) or dry. The function r(τ ) is then deﬁned as the number
of rainy subintervals at scale τ . Olsson et al.
found that this distribution follows
0.8, over a certain range of durations [2]. Note
a power law, r
that for τ
N (all subintervals are rainy), while for τ much shorter than
the characteristic time between raindrops, r saturates at a value M equal to the
total number of raindrops incident on the station during the interval T . Between
these simple limits, r(τ ) may exhibit nontrivial behavior reﬂecting correlations in
the generation or dynamics of raindrops. Now, if the arrival times of the raindrops
were mutually independent (so that the time interval between successive drops at

subinterval would be Poisson-distributed with mean
e−mτ ). Thus a power law distribution with
and we would have r(τ ) = (T /τ )(1
γ < 1 rules out a simple “independent event” model, suggesting some nonlinear
mechanism behind the observed rainfall statistics.

The observations of Olsson et al.

(from Sweden) were later corroborated by
Lavergnat and Gol´e [3] in an experiment performed near Paris. The latter study
generated data on raindrop arrival times and sizes over a 14-month period, and
τ −0.82 over six orders of magnitude (from 0.01 to 104 min-
conﬁrmed the scaling r
utes). Other important conclusions from this study are: (1) the raindrop diameter
distribution decays roughly exponentially (or perhaps as a stretched exponential) for
diameters greater than about 0.5 mm; (2) the distribution of time intervals between
raindrops can be ﬁt to a so-called bi-Pareto distribution over about nine orders of
magnitude. This distribution involves two power law regimes, one for short times
(drops associated with a given storm) another for long times (intervals between
successive storms). On the basis of their analysis Lavergnat and Gol´e conclude
that the waiting time D between successive rain events is power-law distributed:

Convincing evidence for a multifractal spatial distribution of raindrops in storms,
on scale from 1 cm up to meters, was very recently reported by Lovejoy et al. [18].
An important conclusion of these authors is that there is no meaningful way to
describe rain content in the atmosphere in terms of a smoothly varying density,
since large ﬂuctuations are present at all scales. The authors suggest turbulence as
the reason for the ﬂuctuations in raindrop distribution.

Recently a large time-series (six months) from radar observations on the Baltic
coast became available under the BALTEX project [19]. The radar station deter-
mines the quantity of rain falling in a 1 m2 column of the atmosphere. Arrival times
of individual raindrops are not resolved, but the total amount of rain above the sta-
tion at each 1 min. interval is registered. The threshold for detection is 0.005 mm/h;
intervals with a precipitation rate above this threshold have a nonzero rate q(t), oth-
erwise q(t) = 0 for that interval. In their analysis of the BALTEX data, Peters et
al. focus on rain events, deﬁned as sequences of consecutive intervals with nonzero
rainfall [4,5]. A series of consecutive intervals having zero rain deﬁnes a drought.
The intensity I = Pt q(t) of a rain event is the rainfall integrated over its duration.
Peters, Hertlein and Christensen found that the distribution of rain-event sizes at
the Baltic coast station follows a power law over at least three decades. Drought
durations are also power-law distributed over the range of several minutes to about
a week, with a signiﬁcant perturbation apparently reﬂecting diurnal variation. The
power laws identiﬁed by Peters et al. may be expressed in the form

These authors emphasize the similarities between these distributions and those found
for earthquakes, suggesting a parallel with self-organized criticality to be discussed
in the following section.

Taken as a whole, the observations of Olsson et al., Lavergnat and Gol´e, Lovejoy
and co-workers, and Peters et al. present a very strong case for fractal or multifractal
distributions of rain at a given position over time, and in space, at a given instant
[20]. The universality of the observed distributions is less clear. First, the time
series all come from the north of Western Europe, where prolonged dry periods are
evidently rare. The central region of Minas Gerais, Brazil (to cite one example)
experiences a dry spell of several months each year, and might therefore exhibit a
diﬀerent distribution of droughts. The Paris and Sweden experiments yielded similar
values (γ = 0.82) for the exponent characterizing the fractal distribution in time,
while the BALTEX data yield γ
0.55 [5]. On the other hand, the Paris results
suggest τD = 1.68, considerably larger than the Baltic observations. Observations
from other sites (in particular, from other regions of the world, including continental
sites, and oceans), are needed conﬁrm the generality of power laws, and the range
of exponent values.

III. RAIN AND SELF-ORGANIZED CRITICALITY

∼

Peters, Hertlein and Christensen noted a striking similarity between the scal-
ing laws they found in the rain data and those known for earthquakes. Speciﬁ-
cally, earthquake magnitudes M (deﬁned in terms of energy released) follow the
M −τM [21], while the waiting time between earth-
Gutenberg-Richter law Pm(M)
quakes in a given region follows a power-law known as Omori’s law [22,23]. This
suggests a parallel between precipitation in the atmosphere and relaxation of the
Earth’s crust at stressed tectonic-plate boundaries [5]. In the context of seismology,
cooperative relaxation due to elastic interactions and nonlinear friction is captured
by block-spring models [24,25] or, in much-reduced fashion, by sandpile models
[6]. The latter have attracted much attention as the principal example of the self-
organized criticality paradigm for scale-invariance in natural, far-from-equilibrium
systems [6,26,27].

Indeed, sandpile-like models of rainfall have been studied [28,29]. They involve
the directed motion of raindrops such that when a given cell contains more than
a certain number of drops, the latter move to cells at the level below. That such
a model yields power-law distributions for sizes of certain kinds of events is not
surprising, as this is an intrinsic feature of sandpile models [26,30]. (It is less clear
how to deﬁne the duration of a rain event, since sandpiles represent a singular limit
in which event durations cannot be measured on the same time scale as intervals
between events [31,32].)

4

But if certain aspects of rain distributions resemble those of avalanches in
sandpile-like models, the underlying physics remains obscure. While it may yet
prove possible to explain the observed power laws in terms of an open, driven dissi-
pative system [28,29,33], there is no obvious reason for the formation or precipitation
of one raindrop to provoke similar events nearby. Given the attendant release of la-
tent heat, one might instead expect a self-limiting tendency in condensation.

In fact, condensation and precipitation of rain is a complex process, involving the
interplay between atmospheric motion, including turbulent convection, thermody-
namics and nucleation processes [34]. Evaporation, condensation and vertical ﬂuid
motion are strongly coupled via buoyancy. While it is hard to see how direct in-
teractions between raindrops over a mean interparticle distance of 10 cm [18] could
lead to clustering, the drops are of course highly inﬂuenced by the motion of the
surrounding air. The latter is generically turbulent [9], and as such is characterized
by scale-invariant velocity and energy distributions. Thus it appears more promising
to seek the explanation for power-law distributions in atmospheric ﬂuid dynamics.

IV. CHAOTIC ADVECTION

In this and the following sections we will be interested in the dynamics of passive
tracer particles in a ﬂuid. Such a particle follows the local velocity of the ﬂuid at
each moment, so that its trajectory is that of a ﬂuid particle. The ﬂuid velocity
is not aﬀected by the tracers. As such, a tracer represents an idealized limiting
case of a very small, neutrally buoyant particle immersed in the ﬂuid. (Tracers are
small in the sense that (1) their inertia is negligible and (2) the ﬂuid velocity varies
little over the diameter of the tracer.) The idea of the model to be developed below
is that raindrops can be treated, to a ﬁrst approximation, as passive tracers, even
though they are much denser than air, and not always “small.” This study should
nevertheless provide a preliminary indication of how atmospheric motion can aﬀect
the distribution of the raindrops.

Now, if the ﬂuid motion is turbulent, the distribution of passive tracer parti-
cles should also exhibit scale-invariant properties [12,15,16]. An important example
is Richardson’s law, the empirical result that in turbulent ﬂow, the mean-square
separation ℓt between a pair of tracers at time t, given an initial separation of ℓ0,
grows
. If two or more tracers are released at nearby points, we can study
how their trajectories separate over time, leading to the notion of chaotic tracer
motion: trajectories that separate exponentially rapidly with time. A ﬂow need
not be turbulent to exhibit chaos in this sense. Relatively simple ﬂows, such as the
van Karman vortex street or ﬂows generated by systems of point vortices exhibit
this property. Aref showed that this phenomenon, known as chaotic advection or
Lagrangian chaos, appears in systems of as few as four mutually interacting vortices
[13,14]. (The vortex system, which is central to the model developed here, will be
described in detail below.)

Some aspects of chaotic advection can be understood in a general way using
elementary notions from dynamical systems theory. Consider an incompressible
ﬂuid restricted to a ﬁnite volume. A stagnation point in such a ﬂow is a hyperbolic

5

ﬁxed point: due to volume conservation, the ﬂuid is attracted to this point along
one direction, and repelled along another. As a result, a ﬂuid element that passes
near the hyperbolic point is stretched along one direction, compressed along the
other. As stretching continues, the element must double back on itself since it is
conﬁned to a ﬁnite region. Repeated encounters with hyperbolic points lead to
iterated distortions of the kind described above. Thus a ﬂuid element undergoes
repeated stretching and folding similar to the distortions leading to chaos in simple
model systems such as the baker’s transformation [35].

Flow ﬁelds with chaotic advection may also exhibit unstable periodic orbits with
fractal structure [11]; tracers (as well as particles with non-negligible inertia) may
spend long periods of time in the vicinity of these orbits [36]. The eﬀect, once again,
is that an initially compact region becomes highly extended along one direction, and
contracted in the other, and repeatedly folded, yielding a self-similar structure of
bands reminiscent of a strange attractor in a chaotic dynamical system.

Summarizing, the motion of tracer particles in even moderately complex ﬂows
can yield chaotic trajectories and scale-invariant spatial distributions. This suggests
treating rain as a collection of passive tracers moving in a chaotic or turbulent
velocity ﬁeld. The raindrops are released in a localized condensation event, and
then advected by the air before being detected at or above a given point on Earth’s
surface.

What would a reasonably complete model of this process look like? Even ignor-
ing thermodynamic aspects (evaporation and re-condensation of rain, with attendant
latent-heat and buoyancy eﬀects), we would need to treat a three-dimensional atmo-
sphere whose density falls oﬀ exponentially with height, and integrate the Navier-
Stokes equation for an incompressible ﬂuid subject to suitable boundary and initial
conditions, (including a driving term at large scales to compensate small-scale dissi-
pation, if we wish to study a stationary state), at a Reynolds number characteristic
of turbulent motion [37]. To include the possibility of convection we would need
to implement (at least) the Boussinesq approximation, allowing the density to vary
linearly with temperature, and including heat transfer in the description [38,39].
Such a study poses a great challenge to presently avaliable computational tools. In
particular, faithful representation of fully developed turbulence appears (due to the
number of degrees of freedom involved) computationally nonviable, so that reduced
descriptions such as large-eddy simulation or a shell model are required [7,8].

While semi-realistic simulation seems a worthy objective for future study, in this
work I consider a radically simpliﬁed model, which can serve as a proof of principle
of the idea that fractal rain distributions derive from chaotic advection. The model
eliminates nearly all atmospheric processes and takes advantage of a physical system
(point vortices) aﬀording a vast reduction in computational complexity, as explained
in the next section.

V. COMPUTATIONAL MODEL

On the planetary scale, Earth’s atmosphere is two-dimensional. At high
Reynolds numbers, eﬀects of viscosity are limited to small scales and to bound-

6

ary layers. These observations may be seen as possible motivations for what is in
the ﬁnal analysis a simpliﬁcation based on computational necessity, namely, the
study of ideal two-dimensional ﬂow. In potential ﬂow, i.e., for which the ﬂuid ve-
locity u(x, t) can be written as the gradient of a scalar function φ(x, t) [40–42], the
u = 0 implies that φ satisﬁes Laplace’s equation; such
incompressibility condition
u = 0. Potential ﬂow solutions of Euler’s equation
ﬂows are irrotational, i.e.,
satisfy the principle of linear superposition.

We construct more complicated ﬂows by superposing vortices at diﬀerent points rj.
(The vortex is an extended object; rj denotes the position of the singularity.) In a
system of NV point vortices, each vortex j moves in the velocity ﬁeld deﬁned by the
superposition of all vortices except vortex j itself [41]. (For NV ≤
3 the system is
integrable [14].) Thus, in this rather special case we can construct a complex ﬂuid
motion without solving the Euler equation, by integrating the motion of a system of N
point particles. This makes the vortex system particularly attractive for simulating
incompressible, inviscid ﬂow.

Point-vortex systems have been used for some time in studies of two-dimensional
turbulence [7,43,44] and of chaotic advection [13,14], and appear to be relevant to
atmospheric dynamics on various scales [45]. Two interesting scaling properties of
tracers in systems of four or more point vortices are worth noting [14]: (1) the tracers
t1.8; (2)
exhibit anomalous difusion, with the mean-square displacement growing
s−2.7. (Tracers
the lifetime s of vortex pairs follows a power-law distribution, P (s)
are typically excluded from the immediate vicinity of a vortex, but may on the other
hand become trapped at the periphery of a vortex pair.) Compared with direct
integration of the Euler or Navier-Stokes equations, the computational demands
are orders of magnitude smaller. Of course, one is restricted to a two-dimensional,
inviscid ﬂuid. (In the three-dimensional case the vortices become vortex lines, which
stretch and fold under the ﬂow. But such a system may still oﬀer computational
advantages.)

Several types of vortex-strength distributions are studied; the simplest assigns all
vortices the same strength
. Other studies employ a hierarchical vortex distribu-
tion, deﬁned as follows. The zeroth “generation” consists of a pair of vortices with

of the hierarchical distribution is to provide structure on a variety of length scales,
without trying to reproduce any speciﬁc energy spectrum E(k). The vortices are
assigned random initial positions, but their subsequent evolution is deterministic
[46].

Being point objects, the vortices possess no intrinsic length scale. (Note however
that in the presence of other vortices, the ‘sphere of inﬂuence’ of vortex i is propor-

A large number of tracers, Np = 10 000, are thrown at random into a small region
(a square of side 0.05), representing a localized condensation event. (Alternatively,
the tracer-laden region may be interpretated as a parcel of atmosphere of high
humidity, destined to generate precipitation.) In the analysis of rain and drought
events, the observation interval T plays an important role. At time zero the vortices
begin their motion, and the tracers are inserted. The dynamics is followed up to
time T , when the simulation ends.

In the model, ‘rain’ corresponds to the presence of one or more tracers in a very
small predeﬁned region or ‘weather station’, of linear dimension 0.01. At each step
of the integration, the number of particles ni(t) at each station i is monitored. A
sequence of nonzero occupation numbers at a given station constitutes a rain event,
just as in the radar observations [4]; the intensity of a rain event is I = Pt ni(t)
where the sum is over the set of consecutive time steps for which ni(t) > 0. In case
ni = 0, station i is said to experience a drought. The durations of droughts and of
rain events are likewise monitored over a time interval T .

In this example the
tracer-bearing region has become wrapped a vortex pair, and becomes increasingly
stretched. The tracers are widely scattered, but their distribution remains highly
nonuniform, characterized by bands of high particle concentration.
(The tracer-
free regions centered on the vortex pair arise because the ﬂuid trajectories circulate
about the vortices, so that tracers cannot penetrate this region from outside.) At
later times (see Fig. 3, for T = 8τC) tracers are more uniformly distributed, but
there are again empty regions centered on vortices or vortex pairs. (In these studies

Varying the vortex distribution and observation interval T , the following trends
emerge. For T /τC in the range 0.1 - 2, power-law rain-intensity and drought duration
distributions are found, as in Eqs. (1) and (2). The rain-intensity distribution follows
a power law over 4 - 5 1/2 decades, with an exponent τI in the range 0.93 - 1.02. The
drought-duration distribution decays with a somewhat larger exponent, 1.12 - 1.16,
and follows a power law over 3 - 4 decades. Larger exponent values are associated
with higher values of α; these yield somewhat smaller ranges for the power laws.
Conversely, the largest power-law range, and smallest exponent values, are observed
when all vortices are of equal strength. There is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between
the distributions obtained initially and those found after the vortices have had some
time to evolve, suggesting that the equilibration process expected in two-dimensional
turbulence [43,44] is not important as regards rain and drought statistics.

Systems with varying numbers of vortices yield similar distributions, if we scale
1/√NV . This is seen from the data collapse in Fig. 4, in which
the intensity K
results for systems of 10, 20, 50 and 100 vortices (with Np = 104, T
0.85τc, and
K = 0.3 for NV = 10), are shown. Even systems with as few as ten vortices yield
good power laws, indicating that chaotic advection is the essential feature leading
to scale invariance, rather than well developed turbulence.

The results of [17] may be summarized as showing scale-invariant rain-size and
drought-duration distributions for intervals such that the tracers remain highly clus-
tered. Although the decay exponents are somewhat smaller than those obtained from
observational data (1.36 and 1.42 for rain size and drought duration, resp. [4]), the
simulations also show the drought duration decaying more rapidly than that for rain
event sizes. For conditions under which the rain is more thoroughly dispersed, simu-
lations yield stretched-exponential distributions. It is worth noting that the ﬁnding
of non-power-law distributions at longer times does not signal an inability of the
model to reproduce the observational results. Rain, after all, does not remain in the
air indeﬁnitely. (It would, of course, be interesting to have some way of comparing
the model timescale τC with the typical residence time of rain in the atmosphere.)
τC is in fact
The tendency toward a more uniform tracer distribution at times
exagerated by the periodic boundaries of the model, and might occur more slowly
under a corresponding vortex dynamics in the atmosphere.

Even in a system as simple as that considered here, there is a large parameter
space to be explored: number, circulation, and intensity of vortices, size and shape of
the initial particle-bearing region, observation time T . To close this section I report
some preliminary results on situations not considered in [17]. In all cases there are
= 4. A study in which the tracers
ten vortices, all of intensity 0.3, yielding

are released from a circular, rather than a square region yields the same exponents
τI and τD as found previously. Thus the shape of the initial region appears not to

inﬂuence the event statistics.

It is natural to ask how relaxing the “neutrality condition” (equal numbers of
vortices with clockwise and anticlockwise circulation) aﬀects the event distributions,
since there is no obvious reason to assume such neutrality. A study using all vortices
with the same circulation again yields power-law distributions, but with somewhat
diﬀerent exponent values, depending on the observation time. Speciﬁcally, for T =
0.8τC I ﬁnd τI = 1.01(1) and τD = 1.10(2), similar to the results for the neutral
system, while for T = 1.2τC, τI = 1.21(1) and τD = 1.06(1). Thus, allowing a
net circulation results in a larger rain intensity exponent at longer times, while the
drought exponent is slightly smaller.

There is also evidence that releasing the tracers from a smaller region (of linear
size 0.01 instead of 0.05) yields a larger τI and smaller τD. A study using T = 0.5
(and equal numbers of clockwise and anticlockwise vortices), yielded τI = 1.10(2),
1.02. Although it is diﬃcult to draw ﬁrm conclusions from these pre-
while τD ≃
liminary results, they demonstrate the generality of power-law distributions at in-
termediate times, while suggesting that exponent values may change depending on
the ﬂow regime.

VI. SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF TRACERS

As discussed in the preceding section, a very simple model of passive tracers in a
velocity ﬁeld deﬁned by a system of point vortices is capable of yielding power-law
rain-intensity and drought-duration distributions [17]. These results for events at a
ﬁxed observation site suggest that the spatial arrangement of the tracers is somehow
related to the event distributions. One might even hope to understand the scale-
invariant event distributions as arising from a fractal tracer pattern as it sweeps over
the observation site. In this section I present results on the spatial distribution of
the tracer particles, which can be thought of as analogous to the distribution of rain
over a region experiencing storms. The results are for systems with equal numbers
of clockwise and anticlockwise vortices, all of equal intensity K.

As a ﬁrst step, I consider the occupancy histogram N(n) upon partitioning
the system into a ﬁne mesh; N(n) denotes the number of elements with tracer
occupancy n. The simulation cell is divided into 104 square regions or boxes of
side 0.01, and the box-occupancy histogram determined after allowing the particle
conﬁguration evolve for a time T . Recall that initially, a small number of boxes
(25 or so) will have high occupancies, while the rest are empty.
If the particles
tend toward a uniform distribution, we should expect the histogram to approach a
Poisson distribution, with parameter 1 (there are 104 particles) for large T . The
simulation results instead indicate a tendency to form a power-law distribution at
short times, followed by a stretched-exponential form at longer times. Fig. 5 shows
histograms at various observation times for a system of 10 vortices of equal intensity,
= 0.3. At times T /τc = 0.2 and 0.4, a peak near occupancy n = 400 is evident,

a remnant of the initially compact distribution. The histogram follows a power law
N(n)
200 or so, with ǫ = 0.54(1) for T = 0.2τC. As T increases,
the exponent ǫ becomes larger, and the histogram (on log scales) begins to curve

well described by a stretched exponential, N(n)
1/7.
Thus the histogram remains non-Poissonian even for rather long times. For a system
of 100 vortices (with K scaled to maintain the mean velocity constant as discussed
in Sec. V), the histogram is power law (with ǫ = 0.67) for T = 0.2τC, and tends to

In principle, the fractal dimension of the instantaneous particle distribution may
be determined in a manner analogous to the fractal time distribution described in
Sec. III. That is, we divide the system into ever-ﬁner partitions (for example, squares
of side ℓ = 2−n for n = 1, 2, 3, ...) and determine the number r(ℓ) of occupied squares
ℓ−2 away from the limits of
at scale ℓ. For uncorrelated positions we expect r(ℓ)
very large or very small boxes. Applying this analysis to tracer conﬁgurations in the
ℓ−γ with γ = 1.8 - 1.9, depending on the observation
vortex system yields r(ℓ)
time T and number of vortices. This may signal an incipient fractal distribution,
but a glance at a typical conﬁguration (Fig. 2) shows that at the times of interest,
the particle-ﬁlled region is not a fully developed fractal structure, but rather is
essentially linear, becoming increasingly stretched (and wound about one or more
vortices), and folded as times goes on.

∝

The observation of a stretched, linear tracer-bearing region suggests that we dis-
tinguish two directions, locally parallel and perpendicular to the elongated region.
Observe that the particle velocity is approximately parallel to the elongated direc-
tion. Thus it is of interest to deﬁne coordinates η and ξ at any instant, representing
the distance from a given particle i in directions parallel and perpendicular to (re-
spectively) its velocity vi. We study the tracer density as a function of distance from
a randomly chosen particle, along these directions, eﬀectively deﬁning two-point cor-
relation functions C||(x) and C⊥(x). Fig. 6 shows that at time 2τC these functions
are strongly peaked near the origin, demonstrating a high degree of clustering, and
that C||(x) is generally greater than C⊥(x), corresponding to the elongated linear
regions typical of the particle conﬁguration at intermediate times. The correlation
functions at time 8τC (shown in the inset of Fig. 6) are much more uniform, away
from the central peak, and appear to be isotropic.

The conﬁgurations depicted in Fig. 2 suggest that the repeated bands of particles
(due to folding and/or wrapping around a vortex) possess a nested structure. We
look for evidence of fractal structure along the perpendicular direction ξ by dividing
0.005) into segments of length ℓ = 2−n,
this axis (along a narrow swath,
and determining the number of occupied segments r(ℓ) at scale ℓ. This function is
shown for various observation times in Fig. 7. At the shortest times r(ℓ) is constant
for larger ℓ, indicating that only a single box is occupied at the larger scales, due
to the small insertion region (of length 0.01 here). At intermediate times there is
evidence of fractal scaling (for example, at T = 2τC, r
0.05). The
slope γ (away from the saturation region at small ℓ) appears to approach unity at
larger times, again signaling a more uniform tracer distribution. (For T = 2τC the
distribution r(ℓ) in the parallel direction is very similar to that for the perpendicular
direction shown in Fig. 7.)

High-resolution studies of single conﬁgurations (involving 105 tracers released from a

of 20 vortices. Fig. 8 shows how the distribution evolves over time in a typical high-

Summarizing the results described in this section, there is preliminary evidence
for a fractal tracer distribution at intermediate times (on the order of τC) associated
with the nested ﬁlamentary structures generated by stretching and folding of the
particle-bearing region. The timescale for observation of a fractal tracer density
corresponds roughly to that associated with fractal rain and drought distributions.
(One should recall, however, that the latter are accumulated from the time the
tracers are released until time T , whereas the tracer distributions discussed here
are instantaneous.) It is easy to see that a fractal tracer distribution, swept past a
ﬁxed observation point, will generate power-law rain and drought distributions. It
remains to make this connection more precise, a task complicated by the fact that
the characteristics of the tracer distribution vary signiﬁcantly over the observation
period, and may also vary in space, as a glance at Fig. 2 suggests. This raises the
possibility that the power-law distributions found in simulations and in actual mea-
surements represent a superposition of distributions associated with diﬀerent kinds
of regions or events. It would therefore be of interest to identify simpler advection
processes whose fractal properties can be determined with higher precision.

VII. DISCUSSION

I have reviewed observational evidence for fractal rain distributions, and dis-
cussed a highly simpliﬁed model that points to chaotic advection as the underlying
reason. The detailed properties (e.g., the exponents associated with the power-law
distributions) furnished by the model diﬀer from those found in observations. (In
truth, the present “toy” model ignores so many important atmospheric processes
that quantitative agreement, if obtained, might well be regarded as fortuitous. The
observational data, moreover, leave doubt as to the universality of the power laws.)
Simulation of the model nevertheless leads to the signiﬁcant conclusion that neither
interactions between tracers (i.e., between raindrops or rain-bearing parcels of air),
nor fully developed turbulence are needed to generate power-law rain and drought
distributions. The model also yields stretched-exponential event distributions for
longer observation times. While the latter have not been reported, it is well to
recall that the observational data remain rather limited. Observations from other

12

sites are needed to conﬁrm the generality of power laws and the possibility of other
(non-scale-invariant) forms.

Studying the occupancy statistics of boxes of various sizes, I ﬁnd evidence that
the tracer density evolves, under the vortex-system ﬂow, to a fractal distribution at
intermediate times. The nature of this distribution, and its relation to the power
laws found for rain and drought events, needs to be studied in greater detail.

Clearly, the model employed in this proof-of-principle study contains a minimum
of atmospheric physics. A three-dimensional description, allowing for stratiﬁcation,
convection, and vortex stretching would be desirable, as would inclusion of con-
densation, evaporation, and inertial eﬀects [47]. These improvements, all of which
involve signiﬁcant computational complexity and expense, can be expected to al-
ter detailed properties such as exponent values. The vortex model may readily be
adapted to include some of these eﬀects, while others will require a full analysis of
the coupled Navier-Stokes and heat equations.

Since chaotic advection is an intrinsic feature of atmospheric ﬂow, one should
expect scale-invariant distributions to appear quite generally. In this regard it is
interesting to note that simulations of turbulent magnetohydrodynamic processes
reproduce power-law burst distributions for solar ﬂares [48,49], and that tracer pat-
terns similar to those reported here are also found in simulations of two-dimensional
barotropic turbulence [50]. Although (in the interest of simplicity) a closed model
is analyzed in this work, we should expect the same phenomenon to appear in an
open model with driving and dissipation [43], due once again to the chaotic nature
of tracer motion.

In summary, I ﬁnd that tracer distributions in two-dimensional ﬂow, represented
by a system of point vortices, exhibit scale invariance during the early stage of
the dispersal process. The event distributions are associated with fractal tracer
distributions in space, produced by repeated stretching and folding of ﬂuid elem-
nts. It therefore seems worthwhile to develop more realistic models, to understand
the observations in greater detail. Theoretical prediction of the rain and drought
distributions from a model velocity ﬁeld remains as a formidable challenge.

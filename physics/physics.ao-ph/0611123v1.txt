Dynamics of tsunami waves

Fr´ed´eric Dias∗

Denys Dutykh∗

Abstract

The life of a tsunami is usually divided into three phases: the gen-
eration (tsunami source), the propagation and the inundation. Each
phase is complex and often described separately. A brief description
of each phase is given. Model problems are identiﬁed. Their formula-
tion is given. While some of these problems can be solved analytically,
most require numerical techniques. The inundation phase is less doc-
umented than the other phases. It is shown that methods based on
Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) are particularly well-suited
for the inundation phase. Directions for future research are outlined.

Given the broadness of the topic of tsunamis, our purpose here is to
recall some of the basics of tsunami modeling and to emphasize some general
aspects, which are sometimes overlooked. The life of a tsunami is usually
divided into three phases: the generation (tsunami source), the propagation
and the inundation. The third and most diﬃcult phase of the dynamics of
tsunami waves deals with their breaking as they approach the shore. This
phase depends greatly on the bottom bathymetry and on the coastline type.
The breaking can be progressive. Then the inundation process is relatively
slow and can last for several minutes. Structural damages are mainly caused
by inundation. The breaking can also be explosive and lead to the formation
of a plunging jet. The impact on the coast is then very rapid. In very shallow
water, the amplitude of tsunami waves grows to such an extent that typically
an undulation appears on the long wave, which develops into a progressive
bore Chanson [2005]. This turbulent front, similar to the wave that occurs
when a dam breaks, can be quite high and travel onto the beach at great
speed. Then the front and the turbulent current behind it move onto the
shore, past buildings and vegetation until they are ﬁnally stopped by rising
ground. The water level can rise rapidly, typically from 0 to 3 meters in 90
seconds.

The trajectory of these currents and their velocity are quite unpredictible,
especially in the ﬁnal stages because they are sensitive to small changes in the
topography, and to the stochastic patterns of the collapse of buildings, and to
the accumulation of debris such as trees, cars, logs, furniture. The dynamics
of this ﬁnal stage of tsunami waves is somewhat similar to the dynamics of
ﬂood waves caused by dam breaking, dyke breaking or overtopping of dykes
(cf. the recent tragedy of hurricane Katrina in August 2005). Hence research
on ﬂooding events and measures to deal with them may be able to contribute
to improved warning and damage reduction systems for tsunami waves in the
areas of the world where these waves are likely to occur as shallow surge waves
(cf. the recent tragedy of the Indian Ocean tsunami in December 2004).

Civil engineers who visited the damage area following the Boxing day
tsunami came up with several basic conclusions. Buildings that had been

2 Tsunami induced by near-shore earthquake

constructed to satisfy modern safety standards oﬀered a satisfactory resis-
tance, in particular those with reinforced concrete beams properly integrated
in the frame structure. These were able to withstand pressure associated with
the leading front of the order of 1 atmosphere (recall that an equivalent pres-
sure p is obtained with a windspeed U of about 450 m/s, since p = ρairU 2/2).
By contrast brick buildings collapsed and were washed away. Highly porous
or open structures survived. Buildings further away from the beach survived
the front in some cases, but they were then destroyed by the erosion of the
ground around the buildings by the water currents Hunt and Burgers [2005].
Section 2 provides a description of the tsunami source when the source
is an earthquake. In Section 3, we review the equations that are often used
for tsunami propagation. Section 4 provides a short discussion on the energy
of tsunamis. Section 5 is devoted to the run-up and inundation of tsunamis.
Finally directions for future research are outlined.

2 Tsunami induced by near-shore earthquake

The inversion of seismic data allows one to reconstruct the permanent
deformations of the sea bottom following earthquakes. In spite of the com-
plexity of the seismic source and of the internal structure of the Earth, sci-
entists have been relatively successful in using simple models for the source
Okada [1985]. A description of Okada’s model follows.

2.1

Introduction

The fracture zones, along which the foci of earthquakes are to be found,
have been described in various papers. For example, it has been suggested
that Volterra’s theory of dislocations might be the proper tool for a quan-
titative description of these fracture zones Steketee [1958]. This suggestion
was made for the following reason. If the mechanism involved in earthquakes
and the fracture zones is indeed one of fracture, discontinuities in the dis-
placement components across the fractured surface will exist. As dislocation
theory may be described as that part of the theory of elasticity dealing with
surfaces across which the displacement ﬁeld is discontinuous, the suggestion
seems reasonable.

As commonly done in mathematical physics, it is necessary for simplicity’s
sake to make some assumptions. Here we neglect the curvature of the earth,
its gravity, temperature, magnetism, non-homogeneity, and consider a semi-
inﬁnite medium, which is homogeneous and isotropic. We further assume
that the laws of classical linear elasticity theory hold.

2.2 Volterra’s theory of dislocations

4

Several studies showed that the eﬀect of earth curvature is negligible
for shallow events at distances of less than 20◦ Ben-Mehanem et al. [1970],
Ben-Menahem et al. [1969], McGinley [1969], Smylie and Mansinha [1971].
The sensitivity to earth topography, homogeneity, isotropy and half-space
assumptions was studied and discussed recently Masterlark [2003]. The au-
thor used a commercially available code, ABACUS, which is based on a ﬁnite
element model (FEM). Six FEMs were constructed to test the sensitivity of
deformation predictions to each assumption. The main conclusion is that the
vertical layering of lateral inhomogeneity can sometimes cause considerable
eﬀects on the deformation ﬁelds.

The usual boundary conditions for dealing with earth’s problems require
that the surface S of the elastic medium (the earth) shall be free from
forces. The resulting mixed boundary-value problem was solved a century
ago Volterra [1907]. Later, Steketee proposed an alternative method to solve
this problem using Green’s functions Steketee [1958].

2.2 Volterra’s theory of dislocations

In order to introduce the concept of dislocation and for simplicity’s sake,
this section is devoted to the case of an entire elastic space. The second
reason is that in his original paper Volterra solved the problem in this case
Volterra [1907].

Let O be the origin of a Cartesian coordinate system in an inﬁnite elastic
medium, xi the Cartesian coordinates (i = 1, 2, 3), and ei a unit vector in
the positive xi-direction. A force F = F ek at O generates a displacement
ﬁeld uk
i (P, O) at point P , which is determined by the well-known Somigliana
tensor

uk
i (P, O) =

F
8πµ

(δikr, nn −

αr, ik), with α =

(1)

λ + µ
λ + 2µ

.

In this relation δik is the Kronecker delta, λ and µ are Lam´e’s constants,
and r is the distance from P to O. The coeﬃcient α can be rewritten as
α = 1/2(1
ν), where ν is Poisson’s ratio. Later we will also use Young’s
modulus E, which is deﬁned as

−

E =

µ (3λ + 2µ)
λ + µ

.

The notation r, i means ∂r/∂xi and the summation convention applies.

The stresses due to the displacement ﬁeld (1) are easily computed from

Hooke’s law:

σij = λδijuk,k + µ(ui,j + uj,i).

The components of the force per unit area on a surface element are denoted
as follows:

i = σk
T k

νj,

ij ·

where the νj’s are the direction cosines of the normal to the surface element
Sokolnikoﬀ and Specht [1946]. A Volterra dislocation is deﬁned as a surface
Σ in the elastic medium across which there is a discontinuity ∆ui in the
displacement ﬁelds of the type

u−
i = Ui + Ωijxj,

∆ui = u+
Ωij =

i −
Ωji.
−

(3)
(4)

Equation (3) in which Ui and Ωij are constants is the well-known Weingarten
relation which states that the discontinuity ∆ui should be of the type of a
rigid body displacement, thereby maintaining continuity of the components
of stress and strain across Σ.

The displacement ﬁeld in an inﬁnite elastic medium due to a dislocation

of type (1) is then determined by Volterra’s formula Volterra [1907]

uk(y1, y2, y3) := uk(yl) =

∆uiT k

i dS.

(5)

ZZΣ

Once the surface Σ is given, the dislocation is essentially determined by

the six constants Ui and Ωij. Therefore we also write

uk(yl) =

il(P, Q)

where Ωij takes only the values Ω12, Ω23, Ω31. Following Volterra Volterra
[1907] and Love Love [1944] we call each of the six integrals in (6) an ele-
mentary dislocation.

It is clear from (5) and (6) that the computation of the displacement ﬁeld
uk(Q) is performed as follows: A force F ek is applied at Q, and the stresses
σk
ij(P, Q) that this force generates are computed at the points P (xi) on Σ. In
particular the components of the force on Σ are computed. After multipli-
cation with prescribed weights of magnitude ∆ui these forces are integrated
over Σ to give the displacement component in Q due to the dislocation on
Σ.

2.3 Dislocations in elastic half-space

When the case of an elastic half-space is considered, equation (5) remains
valid, but we have to replace σk
ij by another tensor ωk
ij. This can be explained
by the fact that the elementary solutions for a half-space are diﬀerent from
Somigliana solution (1).

The ωk

ij can be obtained from the displacements corresponding to nuclei
of strain in a half-space through relation (2). Steketee showed a method of
obtaining the six ωk
12, which
is relevant to a vertical strike-slip fault. Maruyama derived the remaining
ﬁve functions Maruyama [1964].

ij ﬁelds by using a Green’s function and derived ωk

It is interesting to mention here that historically these solutions were ﬁrst
derived in a straightforward manner by Mindlin Mindlin [1936], Mindlin and Cheng
[1950], who gave explicit expressions of the displacement and stress ﬁelds for
half-space nuclei of strain consisting of single forces with and without mo-
ment. It is only necessary to write the single force results since the other
forms can be obtained by taking appropriate derivatives. Their method con-
sists in ﬁnding the displacement ﬁeld in Westergaard’s form of the Galerkin
vector Westergaard [1935]. This vector is then determined by taking a linear
combination of some biharmonic elementary solutions. The coeﬃcients are
chosen to satisfy boundary and equilibrium conditions. These solutions were
also derived by Press in a slightly diﬀerent manner Press [1965].

like a Somigliana tensor. This term corresponds to a contribution from an
image source of the given point force placed at (ξ1, ξ2,

2.4 Finite rectangular source

Now, let us consider a more practical problem. We deﬁne the elementary
dislocations U1, U2, and U3, corresponding to the strike-slip, dip-slip, and
tensile components of an arbitrary dislocation. In Figure 1 each vector rep-
resents the direction of the elementary faults. The vector D is the so-called
Burger’s vector, which shows how both sides of the fault are spread out:
D = u+

u−.

A general dislocation can be determined by three angles: the dip angle
δ of the fault, the slip angle θ, and the angle φ between the fault plane and
Burger’s vector D. This situation is schematically described in Figure 2.

For a ﬁnite rectangular fault with length L and width W occurring at
depth d (Figure 2), the deformation ﬁeld can be evaluated analytically by
changing the variables and performing integration over the rectangle. This
was done by several authors Chinnery [1963], Iwasaki and Sato [1979], Okada
[1985, 1992], Sato and Matsu’ura [1974]. Here we give the results of their
computations. The ﬁnal results represented in compact form are listed below

deformation is translated to the initial condition of the evolution problem
described in the next section. A few authors have solved the linearized wa-
ter wave equations in the presence of a moving bottom Hammack [1973],
Todorovska and Trifunac [2001].

3 Propagation of tsunamis

The problem of tsunami propagation is a special case of the general water-
wave problem. The study of water waves relies on several common assump-
tions. Some are obvious while some others are questionable under certain
circumstances. The water is assumed to be incompressible. Dissipation is
not often included. However there are three main sources of dissipation for
water waves: bottom friction, surface dissipation and body dissipation. For
tsunamis, bottom friction is the most important one, especially in the later
stages, and is sometimes included in the computations in an ad-hoc way. In
most theoretical analyses, it is not included.

A brief description of the common mathematical model used to study
water waves follows. The horizontal coordinates are denoted by x and y, and
the vertical coordinate by z. The horizontal gradient is denoted by

(cid:18)
The horizontal velocity is denoted by

and the vertical velocity by w(x, y, z, t). The three-dimensional ﬂow of an
inviscid and incompressible ﬂuid is governed by the conservation of mass

In (9), ρ is the density of water (assumed to be constant throughout the ﬂuid
domain), g is the acceleration due to gravity and p(x, y, z, t) the pressure
ﬁeld.

The assumption that the ﬂow is irrotational is commonly made to analyze
surface waves. Then there exists a scalar function φ(x, y, z, t) (the velocity
potential) such that

are not important for tsunami propagation.

(cid:18)

3.1 Classical formulation

The surface wave problem consists in solving Laplace’s equation (10) in a
domain Ω(t) bounded above by a moving free surface (the interface between
air and water) and below by a ﬁxed solid boundary (the bottom).1 The free
surface is represented by F (x, y, z, t) := η(x, y, t)
z = 0. The shape of the
bottom is given by z =

h(x, y). The main driving force is gravity.

−

The free surface must be found as part of the solution. Two boundary
conditions are required. The ﬁrst one is the kinematic condition. It can be
stated as DF/Dt = 0 (the material derivative of F vanishes), which leads to

The second boundary condition is the dynamic condition which states that
the normal stresses must be in balance at the free surface. The normal stress
at the free surface is given by the diﬀerence in pressure. Bernoulli’s equation
(11) evaluated on the free surface z = η gives

To summarize, the goal is to solve the set of equations (10), (12), (13)
and (14) for η(x, y, t) and φ(x, y, z, t). When the initial value problem is

1The surface wave problem can be easily extended to the case of a moving bottom.
This extension may be needed to model tsunami generation if the bottom deformation is
relatively slow.

3.2 Dimensionless formulation

17

integrated, the ﬁelds η(x, y, 0) and φ(x, y, z, 0) must be speciﬁed at t = 0.
The conservation of momentum equation (9) is not required in the solution
procedure; it is used a posteriori to ﬁnd the pressure p once η and φ have
been found.

In the following subsections, we will consider various approximations of
the full water-wave equations. One is the system of Boussinesq equations,
that retains nonlinearity and dispersion up to a certain order. Another one
is the system of nonlinear shallow-water equations that retains nonlinearity
but no dispersion. The simplest one is the system of linear shallow-water
equations. The concept of shallow water is based on the smallness of the ratio
between water depth and wave length. In the case of tsunamis propagating
on the surface of deep oceans, one can consider that shallow-water theory is
appropriate because the water depth (typically several kilometers) is much
smaller than the wave length (typically several hundred kilometers).

3.2 Dimensionless formulation

The derivation of shallow-water type equations is a classical topic. Two

dimensionless numbers, which are supposed to be small, are introduced:

α =

1,

β =

a
d ≪

d2
ℓ2 ≪

1,

(15)

where d is a typical water depth, a a typical wave amplitude and ℓ a typical
wavelength. The assumptions on the smallness of these two numbers are
satisﬁed for the Indian Ocean tsunami. Indeed the satellite altimetry obser-
vations of the tsunami waves obtained by two satellites that passed over the
Indian Ocean a couple of hours after the rupture occurred give an amplitude
a of roughly 60 cm in the open ocean. The typical wavelength estimated
from the width of the segments that experienced slip is between 160 and 240
km Lay et al. [2005]. The water depth ranges from 4 km towards the west of
the rupture to 1 km towards the east. These values give the following ranges
for the two dimensionless numbers:

The equations are more transparent when written in dimensionless variables.
The new independent variables are

x = ℓ˜x,

y = ℓ˜y,

z = d˜z,

t = ℓ˜t/c0,

(17)

where c0 = √gd, the famous speed of propagation of tsunamis in the open
ocean ranging from 356 km/h for a 1 km water depth to 712 km/h for a 4

So far, no approximation has been made. In particular, we have not used
the fact that the numbers α and β are small.

3.3 Shallow-water equations

When β is small, the water is considered to be shallow. The linearized
theory of water waves is recovered by letting α go to zero. For the shallow
water-wave theory, one assumes that β is small and expand φ in terms of β:

φ = φ0 + βφ1 + β2φ2 +

.

· · ·

This expansion is substituted into the governing equation and the boundary
conditions. The lowest-order term in Laplace’s equation is

φ0zz = 0.

(23)

The boundary conditions imply that φ0 = φ0(x, y, t). Thus the vertical
velocity component is zero and the horizontal velocity components are inde-
pendent of the vertical coordinate z at lowest order. Let φ0x = u(x, y, t) and
φ0y = v(x, y, t). Assume now for simplicity that the water depth is constant
(h = 1). Solving Laplace’s equation and taking into account the bottom
kinematic condition yields the following expressions for φ1 and φ2:

The next step consists in retaining terms of requested order in the free-
surface boundary conditions. Powers of α will appear when expanding in
Taylor series the free-surface conditions around z = 0. For example, if one
keeps terms of order αβ and β2 in the dynamic boundary condition (22) and
in the kinematic boundary condition (21), one obtains

∇

Equations (28)–(30) contain in fact various shallow-water models. The so-
called fundamental shallow-water equations are obtained by neglecting the
terms of order β:

Recall that we assumed h to be constant for the derivation. Going back to an
arbitrary water depth and to dimensional variables, the system of nonlinear
shallow water equations reads

ut + α(uux + vuy) + ηx = 0,
vt + α(uvx + vvy) + ηy = 0,
ηt + [u(1 + αη)]x + [v(1 + αη)]y = 0.

ut + uux + vuy + gηx = 0,
vt + uvx + vvy + gηy = 0,
ηt + [u(h + η)]x + [v(h + η)]y = 0.

This system of equations has been used for example by Titov and Syno-
lakis for the numerical computation of tidal wave run-up Titov and Synolakis
[1998]. Note that this model does not include any bottom friction terms. To
solve the problem of tsunami generation caused by bottom displacement,
the motion of the seaﬂoor obtained from seismological models Okada [1985]
and described in Section 3 can be prescribed during a time t0. Usually t0 is
assumed to be small, so that the bottom displacement is considered as an in-
stantaneous vertical displacement. This assumption may not be appropriate
for slow events.

The satellite altimetry observations of the Indian Ocean tsunami clearly
show dispersive eﬀects. The question of dispersive eﬀects in tsunamis is
open. Most propagation codes ignore dispersion. A few propagation codes
that include dispersion have been developed Dalrymple et al. [2006]. A well-
known code is FUNWAVE, developed at the University of Delaware over the
past ten years Kirby et al. [1998]. Dispersive shallow water-wave models are
presented next.

In this subsection, we provide the guidelines to derive Boussinesq-type
systems of equations Bona et al. [2002]. Of course, the variation of bathymetry
is essential for the propagation of tsunamis, but for the derivation the water
depth will be assumed to be constant. Some notation is introduced. The po-
tential evaluated along the free surface is denoted by Φ(x, y, t) := φ(x, y, η, t).

(40)

These two nonlinear equations provide time-stepping for η and Φ. In addi-
tion, Laplace’s equation as well as the kinematic condition on the bottom
must be satisﬁed. In order to relate the free-surface variables with the bot-
tom variables, one must solve Laplace’s equation in the whole water column.
In Boussinesq-type models, the velocity potential is represented as a formal
expansion,

Here the expansion is about z = 0, which is the location of the free surface at
rest. Demanding that φ formally satisfy Laplace’s equation leads to a recur-
rence relation between φ(n) and φ(n+2). Let φo denote the velocity potential
at z = 0, uo the horizontal velocity at z = 0, and wo the vertical velocity
at z = 0. Note that φo and wo are nothing else than φ(0) and φ(1). The

A wide variety of Boussinesq systems can been derived Madsen et al.
[2003]. One can generalize the expansions to an arbitrary z
level, instead of
the z = 0 level. The Taylor series for the cosine and sine operators can be
h and/or

The classical Boussinesq equations are more transparent when written in
the dimensionless variables used in the previous subsection. We further as-
sume that h is constant, drop the tildes, and write the equations for one spa-
tial dimension (x). Performing the expansion about z = 0 leads to the van-
ishing of the odd terms in the velocity potential. Substituting the expression
for φ into the free-surface boundary conditions evaluated at z = 1 + αη(x, t)
leads to two equations in η and φo with terms of various order in α and β.
The small parameters α and β are of the same order, while η and φo as well
as their partial derivatives are of order one.

3.5 Classical Boussinesq equations

The classical Boussinesq equations are obtained by keeping all terms that
are at most linear in α or β.
In the derivation of the fundamental non-
linear shallow-water equations (31)–(33), the terms in β were neglected. It
is therefore implicitly assumed that the Stokes number is large. Since the
cube of the water depth appears in the denominator of the Stokes number
(S = α/β = aℓ2/d3), it means that the Stokes number is 64 times larger in a
1 km depth than in a 4 km depth! Based on these arguments, dispersion is

3.6 Korteweg–de Vries equation

more important to the west of the rupture. Considering the Stokes number
to be of order one leads to the following system in dimensional form2:

The classical Boussinesq equations are in fact slightly diﬀerent. They are
obtained by replacing u with the depth averaged velocity

A number of variants of the classical Boussinesq system were studied by

posed Bona et al. [2002].

The energy of the earthquake is measured via the strain energy released
by the faulting. The part of the energy transmitted to the tsunami wave is

The value for the integral is 4/3. The numerical estimate for E is close to

is equipartition between kinetic and potential energy. It is also important
to point out that a tsunami being a shallow water wave, the whole water
column is moving as the wave propagates. For the parameter values used so
far, the maximum horizontal current is 3 cm/s. However, as the water depth
decreases, the current increases and becomes important when the depth be-
comes less than 500 m. Additional properties of solitary waves can be found
for example in Longuet-Higgins [1974].

5 Tsunami run-up

The last phase of a tsunami is its run-up and inundation. Although in
some cases it may be important to consider the coupling between ﬂuid and
structures, we restrict ourselves to the description of the ﬂuid ﬂow. The
problem of waves climbing a beach is a classical one Carrier and Greenspan
[1958]. The transformations used by Carrier and Greenspan are still used
nowadays. The basis of their analysis is the one-dimensional counterpart of
the system (34)–(36). In addition, they assume the depth to be of uniform
x tan θ. Introduce the following dimensionless quantities, where
slope: h =

free boundary is the instantaneous shoreline c = 0, which moves as a wave
climbs a beach.

The above formulation has been used by several authors to study the
run-up of various types of waves on sloping beaches Carrier et al. [2003],
Tadepalli and Synolakis [1994], Tinti and Tonini [2005]. For example, it has
been shown that leading depression N-waves run-up higher than leading
elevation N-waves, suggesting that perhaps the solitary wave model may
not be adequate for predicting an upper limit for the run-up of near-shore
generated tsunamis.

There is a rule of thumb that says that the run-up does not usually exceed
twice the fault slip. Since run-ups of 30 meters were observed in Sumatra
during the Boxing Day tsunami, the slip might have been of 15 meters or
even more.

Analytical models are useful, especially to perform parametric studies.
However, the breaking of tsunami waves as well as the subsequent ﬂoodings
must be studied numerically. The most natural methods that can be used are
the free surface capturing methods based on a ﬁnite volume discretisation,
such as the Volume Of Fluid (VOF) or the Level Set methods, and the family
of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics methods (SPH), applied to free-surface
ﬂow problems Gomez-Gesteira et al. [2005], Gomez-Gesteira and Dalrymple
[2004], Monaghan [1994]. Such methods allow a study of ﬂood wave dynam-
ics, of wave breaking on the land behind beaches, and of the ﬂow over rising
ground with and without the presence of obstacles. This task is an essential
part of tsunami modelling, since it allows the determination of the level of
risk due to major ﬂooding, the prediction of the resulting water levels in the
ﬂooded areas, the determination of security zones. It also provides some help
in the conception and validation of protection systems in the most exposed
areas.

6 Direction for future research

A useful direction for future research in the dynamics of tsunami waves is
the three-dimensional (3D) simulation of tsunami breaking along a coast. For
this purpose, diﬀerent validation steps are necessary. First more simulations
of a two-dimensional (2D) tsunami interacting with a sloping beach ought
to be performed. Then these simulations should be extended to the case of
a 2D tsunami interacting with a sloping beach in the presence of obstacles.
An important output of these computations will be the hydrodynamic load-
ing on obstacles. The nonlinear inelastic behaviour of the obstacles may be
accounted for using damage or plasticity models. The development of Boussi-
nesq type models coupled with structure interactions is also a promising task.
Finally there is a need for 3D numerical simulations of a tsunami interact-
ing with a beach of complex bathymetry, with or without obstacles. These
simulations will hopefully demonstrate the usefulness of numerical simula-
tions for the deﬁnition of protecting devices or security zones. An important
challenge in that respect is to make the numerical methods capable of han-
dling interaction problems involving diﬀerent scales: the ﬁne scale needed for
representing the damage of a ﬂexible obstacle and a coarse scale needed to
quantify the tsunami propagation.

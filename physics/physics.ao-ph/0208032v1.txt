Abstract

Floquet theory is used to describe the unstable spectrum at large scales of the β-
plane equation linearized about Rossby waves. Base ﬂows consisting of one to three
Rossby wave are considered analytically using continued fractions and the method
of multiple scales, while base ﬂow with more than three Rossby waves are studied
numerically. It is demonstrated that the mechanism for instability changes from
inﬂectional to triad resonance at an O(1) transition Rhines number Rh, independent
of the Reynolds number. For a single Rossby wave base ﬂow, the critical Reynolds
number Rec for instability is found in various limits. In the limits Rh
and
0 and all orientations
k
of the Rossby wave except zonal and meridional, the base ﬂow is unstable for all
Reynolds numbers; a zonal Rossby wave is stable, while a meridional Rossby wave
has critical Reynolds number Rec = √2. For more isotropic base ﬂows consisting
of many Rossby waves (up to forty), the most unstable mode is purely zonal for
2
and is nearly zonal for Rh = 1/2, where the transition Rhines number
is again O(1), independent of the Reynolds number and consistent with a change
in the mechanism for instability from inﬂectional to triad resonance.

0, the classical value Rec = √2 is recovered. For Rh

1 Introduction and the main results

The β-plane equation is a model for large-scale geophysical ﬂows, in which
the eﬀect of the earth’s sphericity is modeled by a linear variation β of the
Coriolis parameter. Due to the β term, solutions of the linearized β-plane
equation are dispersive waves, called Rossby waves, with anisotropic dispersion
βkx/k2, where ω(k) denotes the wave frequency.
relation given by ω(k) =
Zero-frequency linear eigenmodes are zonal ﬂows and form a slow manifold.
In the absence of the β term, the model reduces to the two-dimensional (2D),
incompressible Navier Stokes equations.

−

The present work is motivated in part by numerical simulations of β-plane
ﬂow driven by stochastic forcing at small scales (Chekhlov, Orszag, Galperin
and Staroselsky [1], Smith and Waleﬀe [2], Marcus, Kundu and Lee [3], Huang,
Galperin and Sukoriansky [4]). These authors show that the presence of the β
term leads to anisotropic transfer of energy to large scales and accumulation
of energy on the slow manifold corresponding to zonal ﬂows. The generation
of slow, large scales is also characteristic of other models of geophysical ﬂows,
including three-dimensional (3D) rotating ﬂow [2], and the 2D and 3D Boussi-
nesq equations for rotating stably stratiﬁed ﬂows [5], [6]. The accumulation
of energy in slow modes is interesting given that resonant triad interactions
cannot transfer energy from fast waves directly to slow modes with zero fre-
quency as shown, for example, in Longuet-Higgins and Gill [7] for the β-plane
equation. Newell [8] showed that higher-order interactions, such as resonant
quartets, can lead to energy transfer from Rossby waves to zonal ﬂows. To-
wards a complete understanding of the simulations [1], [2], [3], [4], this paper
describes the large-scale instability of base ﬂows maintained by a single or
several deterministic force(s), for values of β ranging from 0 < β <
, and
for ﬁnite Reynolds numbers.

The results herein extend previous stability analyses of the 2D Navier Stokes
equations and the β-plane equation. Using Floquet theory and a continued
fraction formulation, Meshalkin and Sinai [9] studied the linear stability of the
2D Navier Stokes equations with a Kolmogorov base ﬂow, and found the crit-
ical Reynolds number Rec = √2 for large-scale instability with wavenumbers
k
1. For Reynolds numbers slightly above the critical value, the instability
occurs for modes with wavevector k perpendicular to the wavevector of the
Kolmogorov base ﬂow. Friedlander and Howard [10], Belenkaya, Friedlander
and Yudovich [11] and Li [12] used similar techniques to study the stability of
the 2D inviscid Navier Stokes equations (the 2D Euler equations). Sivashin-
sky [13] used Multiple Scales analysis on the perturbation equation for the 2D
Navier Stokes equations with a Kolmogorov base ﬂow, and obtained a non-
linear amplitude equation describing large-scale ﬂow with Reynolds number
slightly above the critical value Rec = √2. Generalizing the work of Sivashin-

2

sky [13] to the β-plane, nonlinear amplitude equations for super-critical, large-
scale ﬂow were derived by Frisch et al. [14] for a zonal Kolmogorov base ﬂow
and small β
1, and by Manfroi and Young [15] for a nearly meridional
Rossby wave base ﬂow and ﬁxed β = O(1). Instability of resonant triad inter-
actions is absent from [14] because the base ﬂow is zonal and β is small, and
from [15] partly because the Reynolds number is only slightly supercritical
(slightly larger than √2, see 5).

≪

In all of the above stability analyses, the large-scale instabilities have a pre-
ferred direction because the base ﬂows are anisotropic (consisting of a single
mode). More isotropic base ﬂows for the 2D Navier Stokes equations were con-
sidered by Sivashinsky and Yakhot [16], who found that large-scale instability
is not observed for any ﬁnite Reynolds number if the base ﬂow is suﬃciently
isotropic. They used Multiple Scales analysis for the linearized perturbation
equation, with isotropic scaling in space and periodic base ﬂows consisting
of several modes. Recently, Novikov and Papanicolau [17] have extended the
linear analysis of [16] to nonlinear analysis for a rectangular base ﬂow.

For inviscid β-plane ﬂow with large Rhines number, Lorenz [18] found growth
rates of linearly unstable modes from a low-order truncation of the inﬁnite
dimensional eigenvalue problem associated with a base ﬂow consisting of a
Rossby wave and a constant zonal ﬂow. Gill [19] considered a Rossby wave
base ﬂow, and using the continued fraction formulation, noted the transition
from inﬂectional instability for Rh
to resonant triad instability for

In this paper, using the continued fraction formulation and a Rossby wave base
ﬂow with wavevector p, we obtain the equation for the linear growth rate at
the response wavevector k. We study the equation at various Rhines numbers
1/β to ﬁnd the growth rate analytically or numerically, and obtain
Rh
critical Reynolds numbers in diﬀerent limits. For Rh
0, the
critical Reynolds number approaches the value √2 for the 2D Navier Stokes
equations. Manfroi and Young [15] have also recently studied linear stability
of the β-plane equation in the Rh
limit, but with Kolmogorov base

ﬂows instead of Rossby wave base ﬂows. Using Multiple Scales analysis in the
limits Rh
0, they ﬁnd a critical Reynolds number smaller than
the value √2 for the 2D Navier Stokes equations. Our analysis is compared to
that of Manfroi and Young [20] in Section 5. For small Rhines numbers (large
β), we discuss the instability of resonant triad interactions. We also generalize
the work of Sivashinsky and Yakhot [16] for more isotropic base ﬂows to the
β-plane equation.

eigenvalue problem. For ﬁnite Reynolds numbers, convergence of the contin-
ued fractions is guaranteed, and the convergence rate is increased for large-
scale instability with k
1. (Convergence of the continued fractions is dis-
cussed in Appendix A.1.) In Section 3, we consider the base ﬂow wavevector
p = (px, py) = (cos(αp), sin(αp)) and response wavevector k, with k

ﬁxed Rh. In this case the stability problem can be well approximated by a
low dimensional (3

inﬁnite dimensional eigenvalue problem. An important observation is that the
nature of the instability to large scales changes from an inﬂectional instabil-
ity to a triad resonance as the Rhines number is decreased from Rh =
∞
(Figure 4), where the transition Rhines number is O(1) (See Gill [19]). For
= π/2 and Rh < 1, there is a band of unstable
forcing wavevector with αp
wavevectors near k resonant with
p, and the width of this band decreases
as Rh decreases. As shown in reference [7], resonant triad interactions cannot
transfer energy to modes with kx = 0, and indeed the numerical computations
show the most unstable wavevector k near the resonant trace has kx 6
= 0. For
large Rhines numbers and Reynolds numbers above critical (e.g., Re = 10),
the inﬂectional instability is strongest for αp = 0 and perturbation wavevector
with kx = 0.

In Section 6, we compare our results with the recent work by Manfroi and
Young [15] using Multiple Scales analysis. In [15], Manfroi and Young consider
the β-plane with Kolmogorov base ﬂows, rather than the Rossby wave base
ﬂows considered herein. Because their choice of base ﬂow is diﬀerent from
ours, the critical Reynolds number for k
is diﬀerent from
√2. We conﬁrm their results, and reproduce our results for Rossby wave base
ﬂows using Multiple Scales analysis.

In Section 7, base ﬂows consisting of several Rossby waves are considered.
The growth rate of large-scale instability is found analytically for large Rh
following [21]. In Appendix A.3, the method of [21] in Fourier space is shown
to be equivalent to the Multiple Scales analysis following [16]. An important
result is that an “isotropic” base ﬂow consisting of three Rossby waves is
32/3, in contrast to the case of pure 2D ﬂow, which is
unstable above Re >
stable for a similar base ﬂow [16]. We also numerically studied the growth rate

and large enough Re, the most unstable large-scale mode has wavevector k
with kx small but nonzero and kx < ky, again indicating a tendency towards
large-scale zonal ﬂows. A summary is given in Section 8.

This idea was ﬁrst explored by Meshalkin and Sinai [9] for the 2D Navier
Stokes equations in the special case when k and p are perpendicular to each
other. They obtained the classical critical Reynolds number √2 for the ﬁrst
instability at large scales. Later, Friedlander et al. [10], Belenkaya et al. [11]
and Li [12] used similar techniques to study the stability of a Kolmogorov ﬂow
for the inviscid (Re =
) Navier Stokes equations (Euler equations). In this
paper, we consider only the viscous (Re <

the continued fractions in equation (15). The convergence is straightforward
since for ﬁxed λ, k, αk, Re and Rh, we have

each λ satisfying (15), one can construct
so that (8) is well-deﬁned. For
this discussion, we refer to [10], [11] and [12]. Unfortunately, the technique of
continued fractions can not be extended for m > 1.

Thus, the wavevector with the strongest instability is inside the darker regions.

(σ(k; αp, Re, Rh))
For base ﬂow (11) with m = 1, the linear growth rate
is the real part of the solution to (15) with the largest real part. Since we
consider the viscous case (Re <

convergence. Thus, we can truncate the continued fractions in (15) for
for some large N. This is equivalent to truncating the inﬁnite dimensional
(2N + 1)
eigenvalue problem (12) for
ﬁnite dimensional eigenvalue problem. We ﬁnd all eigenvalues for the truncated
eigenvalue problem using the MATLAB function ’eig’. Then, σ(k; αp, Re, Rh)
is the eigenvalue with the largest real part. For most numerical results, we
use N = 15. We check the results with N = 16 for some cases and ﬁnd no
signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the results for N = 15 and N = 16.

3 Large Scale Analysis for ﬁxed Rh

In this section, we derive the growth rate for small k
1 with base ﬂow
(11) at ﬁxed αp, Re and Rh by asymptotic expansion of equation (15) of
continued fractions. From the growth rate, we also ﬁnd the critical Reynolds
0. From (15), we show that the linear growth rate

which is the large-scale growth rate obtained by Sivashinsky and Yakhot [16]
and by Waleﬀe [21]. Note that no assumption is made on Rh for (16). However,
since the higher order term H3 is O(k3/Rh), the leading order term in (16)
is a good approximation of the actual growth rate if Rh is large. The leading
order term can also be derived using Multiple Scales analysis by assuming
that the Rhines number is large as shown in Appendix A.3. See [6], [16], [14],
[15] and [20] for more details. Note that one advantage of using equation (15)
of continued fractions is that we can obtain the growth rate (16) up to third
order in k explicitly.

3.1 Derivation of the growth rate

k

(17)

This assumption is required as follows. In general, the inﬁnite dimensional
eigenvalue problem (12) has inﬁnitely many eigenvalues for each wavevector
k. In particular for k = 0, (12) has eigenvalues

0,

12/Re,

and thus
ℜ
(12) has eigenvalues

(σ(0; αp, Re, Rh)) = 0. Therefore, for k

1 we can expect that

≪

12/Re + O(k),

22/Re + O(k),

−

−

.

· · ·

Assumption (17) guarantees that we obtain the ﬁrst eigenvalue which has
the largest real part for k
1. In fact, with assumption (17) one ﬁnds that

≪
(σ(k; αp, Re, Rh)) = O(k2) as shown below (see (27)).

3.2 Marginal Reynolds numbers Re0(k; αp, Rh)

The critical Reynolds number is the smallest nonnegative Reynolds above
which a base ﬂow base becomes unstable. With base ﬂow (11), the critical
Reynolds number depends on αp and Rh, and is denoted by Rec(αp, Rh).
Similarly, the critical Reynolds number Rec(k; αp, Rh) at a ﬁxed wavevec-
tor k is deﬁned by the smallest nonnegative Reynolds number above which
(σ(k; αp, Re, Rh)) is positive, and can be found by setting the growth rate
ℜ
equal to zero. In other words, if the Reynolds number is larger than Rec(k; αp, Rh),
then the wavevector k becomes unstable. If such a Reynolds number does not
exist at k, we deﬁne Rec(k; αp, Rh) =
in the sense that the wavevector k
is stable for all ﬁnite Reynolds numbers. Note that Rec(k; αp, Rh) =
does
not imply that the wavevector k is unstable for the inviscid (Re =
) β-plane
equation. In terms of Rec(k; αp, Rh), Rec(αp; Rh) satisﬁes

∞

Rec(αp, Rh) = min

The critical Reynolds number Rec(k; αp, Rh) for k
1 may be found by
setting the growth rate (16) to be zero. However, it is nontrivial to ﬁnd
Rec(k; αp, Rh) from the growth rate (16) since the explicit expression for the
higher-order term H4 in (16) is not known. Instead, we study the smallest non-
negative Reynolds number which make the leading order term of (16) equal
to zero by solving

It is called the marginal Reynolds number and denoted by Re0(k; αp, Rh).

where the value √2 is the classical critical Reynolds number for the 2D Navier

Note that (34) depends only on αp but not Rh and is an increasing function in
π/2. For the case αp = π/2, (34) is inﬁnite in the sense that for any
0
Reynolds number, wavevectors k with
k
< k0 are stable if k0 is small enough.
|
|
By deﬁnition, the critical Reynolds number Rec(αp, Rh) is less than or equal to
(34). The expression (34) increases to inﬁnity as αp increases to π/2. Thus, we
expect that Rec(αp, Rh) is strictly less than (34) if αp is not too close to zero.
In this case, the ﬁrst unstable wavevector is observed “away” from the origin
as the Reynolds number is increased from zero. For example, for αp = π/4
and Rh = 10, instability is ﬁrst observed near wavevector k = (
0.17, 0.18)
at Reynolds number Re

1.59 (Figure 2). We have

Re0(k; αp = π/4, Rh = 10).

As the Reynolds number is increased, the unstable region becomes a long
strip and reaches to the origin at the Reynolds number (34) (Figure 2(b) with
αp = π/4 and Re = 8). This is diﬀerent from the 2D Navier-Stokes equations
with a Kolmogorov base ﬂow where the ﬁrst instability is always observed at
k

0 at Reynolds number √2 [9], [16], and [21].

4 Linear Stability as Rh decreases

From the numerical solution of (15), we consider the behavior of the growth
rate of the perturbation at wavevectors k over
< 1 for various Rhines num-
bers Rh. We ﬁrst give a preliminary discussion of resonant triad interactions
between wave solutions of the β-plane equation.

4.1 Resonant Triad Interactions

As stated in Section 2, the β-plane equation has wave solutions, called Rossby
waves,

Ψ(x, t; k) = ˆΨ(t; k) exp (iθ(x, t; k)) + c.c,

where c.c is the complex conjugate and the phase θ(x, t; k) is given by (3). We
may represent the solution Ψ(x, t) in terms of the waves by

Ψ(x, t) =

ˆΨ(t; k) exp (iθ(x, t; k)) with ˆΨ∗(t; k) = ˆΨ(t;

interactions. See Waleﬀe [22], [23] for more discussion. From (44), in the limit

A triad (k, p, q) is resonant if it satisﬁes the resonant conditions

k + p + q = 0,

ω(k) + ω(p) + ω(q) = 0.

(45)

The dispersion relation (4) of the β-plane equation allows resonant triads as
shown in Longuet-Higgins and Gill [7]. They showed that for a given wavevec-
= 0, the trace of wavevectors resonant to p forms a closed
tor p with px 6
curve. For p with px = 0, the resonant trace consists of the wavevectors k
py/2. Figure 3 shows three traces resonant to p for αp = 0, π/4
with ky =
and π/2 with p = 1. For 0
αp < π/2, as illustrated in Figure 3, resonant
traces are tangential to the line kx = 0 at the origin. By asymptotic expansion
of (45) in kx and ky for k

where r = 3 for 0 < αp < π/2 and r = 4 for αp = 0. The resonant trace for p
with αp = π/2 is diﬀerent from αp

1
2 . In this case, if the triad (k, p, q) is a resonant triad, then k = q
ky =
which results in Cpqk = 0 from (44). Thus, the mode p with px = 0 can not
receive or lose energy by direct resonant triad interactions ([7], [22]).

We study the linear growth rate over k with
< 1 at various values of Rhines
numbers by solving the eigenvalue problem (12) numerically as discussed in
Section 2.2. Equation (12) is truncated at N = 15, resulting in a 31

The Reynolds number is ﬁnite and large enough to exhibit instabilities. In most
ﬁgures, the Reynolds number is ﬁxed at 10 unless otherwise speciﬁed.

First, we consider the case αp = 0 in Figure 4. Recall that growth rate
(σ(k; αp = 0, Re, Rh)) has symmetries about both the x-axis and the y-axis
ℜ
(Section 2.2). Thus, it is enough to consider wavevectors k with 0 < kx < 1
and 0 < ky < 1 in each plot of Figure 4. We use a grid size of 100
100. At
Rh =
(Figure 4(a)), the most unstable wavevectors are along the line of
kx = 0 which is perpendicular to the base ﬂow wavevector p, consistent with
the results by Sivashinsky and Yakhot [16] and by Waleﬀe [21]. We refer to the
instability at wavevectors near perpendicular to p at large Rhines numbers
(Rh
2) as the inﬂectional instability. This terminology is motivated by the
existence of inﬂection points in the proﬁle of the sinusoidal base ﬂow, which
can be considered as the source of instability. 2

most unstable wavevector is not exactly at kx = 0 but near kx = 0 (Fig-
ure 4(c)). As Rh is decreased more, the unstable region becomes much nar-
rower (Figure 4(d)). In fact, this narrow band lies along the traces resonant
to the base ﬂow wavevector p and its conjugate
p. The resonant traces cor-
respond to black lines in Figure 4(c), (d) and (f). Thus, the nature of the
instability changes from the inﬂectional instability to the resonant triad inter-
action as Rh is decreased. This transition of instability is observed at Rhines
number between 2 and 1/2 for Reynolds number Re = 10. Actually, the or-
der of the Rhines number of the transition appears to be independent of the
Reynolds number. Figure 4(e) and (f) exhibit the transition at Rhines number
between 2 and 1/2 with Reynolds number Re = 1000. See also Gill [19].

A similar transition is observed for any 0 < αp < π/2 as demonstrated in Fig-
ure 5 for αp = π/4 at Re = 10 over
1 < kx < 1 and 0 < ky < 1 with a grid
100. As Rh is decreased from 2 to 1/2, the most unstable wavevec-

The case of αp = π/2 must be considered separately. As discussed in Section
4.1, the base ﬂow wavevector p = (0, 1) cannot lose energy directly by resonant
triad interactions, and as the Rhines number is decreased, the ﬂow becomes
stable as show in Figure 6 at Rh = 1/2. Indeed, at any ﬁnite Reynolds number,
the zonal base ﬂow (αp = π/2) becomes stable at suﬃciently small Rhines
number. Stability of zonal ﬂows for small Rhines number was shown by Kuo
[25] and is discussed further in Section 5.

Figure 8 and 9 suggest that for an isotropic base ﬂow (6) with large m, the
strongest linear growth rate could be observed along kx = 0 for large Rhines
number (Rh
2 for example). Thus, the modes with αpj close to 0 may play
more important roles than the modes with αpj close to π/2. In Section 7, we
consider the linear growth rate for more isotropic base ﬂows (5) with m

by solving a severe truncation of (9) to verify this suggestion.

For αp = π/2, the critical Reynolds number is

enough. Similarly, the critical Reynolds number is 0 (or √2) for 0 < αp < π/2
(or αp = 0) in the sense that for any Reynolds number larger than 0 (or
√2) the base ﬂow is unstable if Rh is small enough. As discussed in Section
4, resonant triad interactions are the dominant mechanisms for instability in
the limit Rh
0. In fact, the result for 0 < αp < π/2 in (49) is obtained
by considering wavevectors k resonant to p as shown later in this section.
We will show that the expression for Rec(αp, Rh) in the limit Rh

asymptotic to the critical Reynolds number obtained from a single resonant
triad for 0 < αp < π/2. Thus, we ﬁrst consider linear stability of a single triad

expression for the critical Reynolds number (54) of a resonant triad, and (56)

than √2, the critical Reynolds number for the 2D Navier Stokes equations.

0 yielding a boundary layer at αp = 0. Also, for a ﬁxed

shows the critical Reynolds numbers for k = 0.05 with s = 3, 4 and 5. The
divergence near αp = π/6 is strong for s = 3, and almost disappears for s = 5.
Relation (49) for 0 < αp < π/2 is also veriﬁed in Figure 10(d) where the

wavevectors k resonant to p with αp = π/9, π/4 and π/3. The horizontal line

From the imaginary part of (61), one can see that Recρ = o(k2). Thus, the
real part balance in (61) gives (55). Finally, we have Rec(k; αp, Rh) = O(k1/2)

For αp = 0, in Figure 10(a) and (b), the critical Reynolds number along

In fact, we need to consider wavevectors of the form k = (0, ky). One can show

which in turn implies inequality “
” in (49). To show (62), note that (16) at
k = (0, ky) is reduced to the growth rate for the 2D Navier Stokes equations
with k
p since ω(k) = 0. Thus, the critical Reynolds number at k = (0, ky)
is √2 (see [9], [16] and [21]). It remains to show the other inequality “

(49) for αp = 0. This requires rather complicated analysis, and is shown in
Appendix A.2.

In earlier work of Manfroi and Young [15], they considered a base ﬂow of the
form

Ψ0

G = cos x + Uy.

(72)

This base ﬂow is obtained by adding a term Uy to the Kolmogorov base ﬂow
(63) with αp = 0. As Manfroi and Young [15] pointed out, this term accounts
for a Galilean translation in the x-direction with the speed U. Through this
Galilean translation the Rossby wave base ﬂow (65) becomes (72) if 1/Rh = U.
Under this translation, one can show that the β-plane equation remains same.
Thus, the base ﬂows (72) and (65) are equivalent under the translation if
1/Rh = U. With base ﬂow (72), Manfroi and Young obtained the critical
Reynolds number √2 if 1/Rh = U. This is consistent with our result that the
critical Reynolds number is √2 with the Rossby wave base ﬂow (65).

growth rate at k with k

isotropic) and is negative for all Reynolds numbers. Thus, there is no direct
instability to large-scales for the ﬂow Φ0

rather complicated. Later, Waleﬀe [21] obtained the same result easily by
direct application of formula (16) for m = 1 with Rh =

there is no direct instability to large scales for all Reynolds numbers. This is
the result by Sivashinsky and Yakhot for the “isotropic” base ﬂow Φ0
3 and also
obtained by Waleﬀe [21].

An interesting observation is that for Rh <
, the large-scale growth rate
(80) does not depend on the particular orientation of pj. However, (80) is not
isotropic in k because the β-plane equation itself is not isotropic. The growth
rate (80) depends on k only through ω(k), whereas growth rates (16) and (75)
depend on k not only through ω(k) but also through α or α1, respectively.

7.2 Numerical study of the growth rate for various Rh

In this section, we consider the linear growth rate at wavevector k with k < 1
for large-scale instability with m
2 in (6). As discussed in Section 2, it is not
straightforward to solve (9) numerically for m
2 since the technique of the
continued fractions used for m = 1 can not be generalized. However, in Section
4.2 we also observe that for m = 1 the severe truncation (48) with n =
1, 0, 1
is a qualitatively good approximation for small k. With this background, we
truncate (9) to a ﬁnite dimensional eigenvalue problem with

in Section 7.1 for the “isotropic” ﬂow (74) with m = 3. For Rhines number
, the largest growth rate is observed to be exactly along the line

kx = 0. However, for Rh = 1/2, the largest growth rate shifts slightly away
from kx = 0. Again, this transition can be understood in terms of resonant
triad interactions, which cannot transfer energy into wavevectors with kx = 0.

A similar result transition is observed in Section 4.3. The O(1) Rhines number
for the transition seems to be independent of Re and m, as demonstrated in
Figure 12 for Re = 1000 with m = 30, and Re = 10 with m = 40.

8 Summary

The growth rate of linear instability at large scales is obtained for Rossby
wave base ﬂows maintained by deterministic forcing of one or several Fourier
modes. For forcing of a single mode, we use the technique of continued fractions
following [9], [19], [10], [11] and [12], and asymptotic analysis. We show that the
mechanism for linear instability changes from inﬂectional to triad resonance
at an O(1) transition Rhines number, independent of the Reynolds number.
The critical Reynolds number for instability has also been obtained in various
limits. In the limits k
, we recover the classical result
Rec = √2 found by Meshalkin and Sinai [9] for the 2D Navier Stokes equations
(see also [16], [14], [15] and [21]). Furthermore, we generalize [9] to ﬁnd Rec
given by equation (34) for k
0,
we ﬁnd Rec = 0 for Rossby wave base ﬂows of all orientations except zonal
and meridional (i.e., for 0 < αp < π/2, where αp measures the angle between
the forcing wavevector p and the zonal direction ˆx, and
0,
a zonal base ﬂow is stable and a meridional base ﬂow has Rec = √2. It is clear
that, for small Rhines numbers, resonant triad interactions reduce the critical
Reynolds number below √2 for 0 < αp < π/2.

ﬂow was found to be stable for Rh =
in [16]. For large m, such a base
ﬂow mimics deterministic forcing over a shell of radius one in Fourier space.
Numerical computations of growth rates for m = 30 and m = 40 show that the
most unstable mode is purely zonal with kx = 0 for 2
(Figure 11
and 12). This is because one of the forced Rossby waves is meridional with
αp = 0, and the inﬂectional instability is strongest for meridional base ﬂows,
as shown in Figure 8 and 9, and discussed in Section 3.3. As the Rhines
number is decreased from Rh = 2 to Rh = 1/2, the most unstable mode k
shifts to a nearly zonal ﬂow with kx not exactly zero (Figure 11 and 12). This
transition in the most unstable wavevector can be understood as the change
from inﬂectional instability to resonant triad instability at Rh = O(1), and
reﬂects the result that resonant triads cannot transfer energy directly to zonal
ﬂows with kx = 0 [1] (see also [7], [8], [6], [2], [5] and Section 3). Waleﬀe
[22] showed analytically that resonant triad interactions can transfer energy
to nearly zonal ﬂows with kx near zero. In Figure 11 and 12, however, one

also sees that wavevectors with kx exactly equal to zero remain unstable even
for Rh = 1/2, though they are not the most unstable wavevectors. This is
because for Rh = O(1), the mechanism for instability is a combination of
both the inﬂectional and triad resonance instabilities. The latter observation
may be relevant to recent simulations of β-plane ﬂow driven by isotropic,
stochastic forcing in a wavenumber shell [1], [2], [3]. With energy input rate
ǫf and peak wavenumber kf of the stochastic force, the Rhines number for
f )1/3/β, measuring the
these simulations is appropriately deﬁned as Rh = (ǫf k2
relative strength of the forcing and β terms. In [1], this deﬁnition of Rh leads
to three values Rh =
, Rh = 5 and Rh = 1. In the latter two cases, energy
is transferred anisotropically to large-scale zonal ﬂows with kx = 0. Even
though our Rhines number is deﬁned diﬀerently, it is nevertheless intriguing
that linear instability mechanisms transfer energy to zonal ﬂows with kx = 0
for our Rh = 2. Indeed, for Rh = 2, the most unstable modes are purely zonal
ﬂows. Thus it is possible that linear instability plays a role in the population
of zonal ﬂows observed in numerical simulations of the (nonlinear) β-plane
system at moderate Rhines numbers Rh > 1. Further study of stability of the
stochastically forced system and of nonlinear transfer mechanisms is necessary
to fully understand numerical simulations at both large and small values of
the Rhines number. Finally we note that, for the atmosphere and the oceans,
Rhines number O(1) is associated with the most energetic eddies [19]. From
the peak wavenumber of the atmospheric spectrum, Gill [19] estimates that
the Rhines number of the atmosphere at 400N and 500 mb is approximately
0.9.

A.3 Multiple scale analysis

In this section, we consider the base ﬂows (68), (73) and (74) and ﬁnd the
large scale growth rate of perturbations using Multiple Scales analysis. These
base ﬂows are spatially periodic. For Multiple Scales analysis, we rotate these
base ﬂows to be periodic in both x and y. Being periodic in the coordinate
directions simpliﬁes Multiple Scales analysis. For (73) and (74), let p = p1.
With the rotation of αp, the β-plane equation becomes (69) and the base ﬂows
(68), (73) and (74) becomes

These are the base ﬂows studied by Sivashinsky and Yakhot [16] for the large
scale instability in the two dimensional Navier-Stokes equation (Rh =

Also, Manfroi and Young [20] considered the base ﬂow (A.11) with c = 1.

(A.17)

Note that from (A.16) and (A.17), Ψ0 depends on x, y, Rh1 and T . For the
details of derivations of (A.16) and (A.17), we refer Sivashinsky and Yakhot
[16] and Manfroi and Young [20] (see also [6], [14] and [15]).

We seek the solution of (A.16) of the form

ψ = ψ0 + εψ1 + ε2ψ2 +

.

· · ·

and for simplicity we assume that the base ﬂow satisﬁes (A.14). This assump-
tion is not true for the base ﬂow (A.11) if c

= 1.

From the zeroth (O(1)) approximations of (A.16) and (A.17), we assume that

ψ0 = A(T, τ )ei(K

From the ﬁrst (O(ε)) approximation of (A.17), we have AT = 0 and thus
A = A(τ ) in ψ0. From the second (O(ε2)) approximation, neglecting small
terms of the order O(Re2), we ﬁnd

Neglecting terms of the order O(Re2) in the second (O(ε2)) approximation is

Inserting ψ0, ψ1 and ψ2, it reduces to

Aτ = σA for some σ.

and the linear growth rate is obtained by taking the real part of σ. We refer
to Sivashinsky and Yakhot [16] for the details.

In the case of the base ﬂow (A.12), (A.18) gives the growth rate

In the case of the base ﬂow (A.11), since it does not satisfy (A.14) for c
= 1,
we can not use (A.18) to ﬁnd the growth rate. Multiple Scales analysis for
(A.11) can be used in a similar way as above and the result is (71). We omit
this and refer to Manfroi and Young [20] for details.

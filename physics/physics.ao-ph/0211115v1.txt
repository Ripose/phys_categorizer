Abstract

A possibility of geophysical measurements using the large scale laser in-
terferometrical gravitational wave antenna is discussed. An interferometer
with suspended mirrors can be used as a gradiometer measuring variations
of an angle between gravity force vectors acting on the spatially separated
suspensions. We analyze restrictions imposed by the atmospheric noises
on feasibility of such measurements. Two models of the atmosphere are
invoked: a quiet atmosphere with a hydrostatic coupling of pressure and
density and a dynamic model of moving region of the density anomaly
(cyclone). Both models lead to similar conclusions up to numerical fac-
tors. Besides the hydrostatic approximation, we use a model of turbulent
atmosphere with the pressure ﬂuctuation spectrum ∼ f −7/3 to explore the
Newtonian noise in a higher frequency domain (up to 10 Hz) predicting the
gravitational noise background for modern gravitational wave detectors.
Our estimates show that this could pose a serious problem for realiza-
tion of such projects. Finally, angular ﬂuctuations of spatially separated
pendula are investigated via computer simulation for some realistic atmo-
spheric data giving the level estimate ∼ 10−11 rad·Hz−1/2 at frequency
−4 Hz. This looks promising for the possibility of the measurement
∼ 10
of weak gravity eﬀects such as Earth inner core oscillations.

Introduction

−

A possibility of geophysical measurements with large scale laser interferometrical
gravitational wave antenna [1, 2] was discussed in [3, 4]. It was supposed that at
very low frequencies 10−3
10−5 Hz the interferometer with suspended mirrors
can be considered as an angular gravity gradiometer measuring variations of the
mutual angle between gravity force vectors or plumb lines of spatially separated
suspensions. Geophysical information could be read out as error signal of the
feedback circuits which preserves the operational angle position of the mirrors.
As an example of geophysical phenomenon for the measurement a very weak
eﬀect of the Earth inner core oscillations (one of “hot points” of modern geo-
physics [5]) was considered in [4].

A number of principal instrumental problems were analyzed in [6, 7] (such
as a necessity of suspension for the laser injection bench, the problem of tilt and
shift diﬀerentiation for spherical mirrors, and others); the main part of instru-
mental noises at low frequencies was estimated in [7] where a positive conclusion
was drawn in favor of a feasibility of geophysical measurements. However, envi-
ronmental geophysical ﬂuctuations produce a predominant noise background
It is clear that, for
which can be a problem while realizing this program.
any gravitational device, the fundamental and unavoidable source of noises is
the gravitational attraction of stochastically moving surrounding masses, the
so-called “Newtonian gravity noise.” Such noise produced by acoustic waves,
propagating under the interferometer base ground, was calculated in [8] at high
frequency f

10 Hz typical for gravitational detectors.

In this paper, we estimate, at least at the order of magnitude, the Newtonian
ﬂuctuations of the mutual angle between two separated plumb lines (suspended

≥

mirrors) produced by atmospheric perturbations; preliminary results were pre-
sented in [9].

Stochastic density variations and transportation of large air masses produces
a contribution into the gravity force on the Earth surface. Almost all processes
of such kind are connected with the corresponding pressure changes. Thus
they can be controlled by means of pressure monitoring.
In the gravimetry
theory, it is well known that the inﬂuence of atmospheric pressure on the gravity
consists of direct attraction of the atmospheric mass and crust deformation due
to atmospheric loading [10].

The both eﬀects have the same order of magnitude but the loading eﬀect, as
a rule, is at least two-ﬁve times less then the direct attraction. For this reason,
below we consider only the direct attraction eﬀect as one of main contributions
to the atmospheric Newtonian noises.

As a control reference point in our analysis, we bear in mind an acceptable
level of the noise spectrum density which allows one to register the inner core
oscillations with amplitudes of the order of 1 m — the expected signal can
achieve 10−13
10−14 rad for the interferometer base equal to 3 km [2, 5].
Suppose that the period and quality factor of the inner core of the fundamental
mode are τ0 = 3.3 h and Q = 102
103, respectively [11]. Then one can take
the measurement time τm = 106 sec which results in the following angular noise

1 Plane atmosphere

A very rough and simple Earth atmospheric model is a half-space ﬁlled by
air stratum of the homogeneous density ρ of the altitude h. A change in the
gravity acceleration ∆g caused by perturbation of the atmospheric density can
be estimated as follows [12]

∆gz =

∆p,

2πG
g

(1)

where ∆p is the atmospheric pressure variation, g is the gravity acceleration,
G is Newtonian gravity constant and z-axis is directed upward. The factor of
admittance between the gravity and pressure kp = 2πG/g = 0, 427 µGal/hPa is
widely used in geophysics and is in a fair correspondence with experimental data.
One can easily get (1) starting with the surface ﬁeld of the stratum gz = 2πGρh
and using a hydrostatic coupling between the pressure and density p = ρgh if
one supposes very slow variations.

Although this formula has an integral sense, one can likely use it in a spectral
form by substituting the corresponding spectral densities of the gravity and
pressure variables, having in mind the fact that the changes of pressure are
mostly quasistatic processes, i.e. the factor of admittance does not depend on
frequency.

After this, the relative angular deﬂection of two plumb lines located at the
ends of the interferometer’s base can be evaluated phenomenologically, in view

gx components of gravity variations.

≪

To evaluate the ξ factor, we suppose that pressure changes along the x-
direction so slowly, that (1) remains to be valid and it leads to the condition
Lp. Then using the potential character of the gravity ﬁeld, i.e., rot g = 0,
h
one can take ∂gx/∂z = ∂gz/∂x, or ∆gx/h
∆gz/Lp. This results in the

which might be used while calculating in view of formula (2).

The pressure time variation background was investigated by many meteoro-
logical observatories in diﬀerent places. In spite that it is a local characteristic,
there are typical common features in the spectrum density such as the diurnal

because the angular noise is at the border of the expected gravity eﬀect. How-
ever, it is supposed that a correction for the gravity atmospheric noise could be
carried out if one would precisely control pressure variations in the location of
front and end mirrors.

2 Cyclone dynamic eﬀect

An obvious lack of the previous consideration is an uncertainty of the ξ factor
which cannot be regorously found within the framework of the homogeneous
static model of the atmosphere. To avoid this uncertainty, it would be useful to
consider a more complex dynamic model where some spatially limited domain
inside the atmospheric half space, called below as “cyclone” (characterized by
perturbed parameters of density and pressure) moves along the interferometer
base. Then a direct calculation of its Newtonian attraction permits one to get
a more reliable estimation of mutual angular deﬂections of the interferometer
arm’s mirrors.

It is convenient to take the cyclone form as an oblate ellipsoid of rotation
because its gravitational ﬁeld can be expressed in terms of elementary functions
[14]. After this, the problem is formulated as follows. The cyclone (ellipsoid
of rotation) with its plane of symmetry on the Earth surface moves along the
x axis where the interferometer arm is located (ﬁgure 1). Only upper half of
the ellipsoid has a physical sense representing the cyclone, so that an eﬀective
gravitational ﬁeld along the x- axis must decrease twice. A vertical size of the
cyclone (a minor ellipsoid semiaxis c) is approximately equal to the atmosphere
h), however, it is much less then a horizontal size of
altitude in z direction (c
the cyclone, a major semiaxis a (a
h). Let us take a Cartesian coordinate
∼
system in the cyclone center in such a way that the current value x is just the
distance between the cyclone and interferometer centers. The positions of the
front and end suspended mirrors are (x
L/2) and (x+L/2), with L representing
−
the interferometer arm length. The cyclone pass through the interferometer base
corresponds to the x variation in the limits (+

In principle, formula (4), in combination with the corresponding formula
inside the ﬁgure, gives a possibility to determine dynamic perturbations of mir-
ror’s plumb lines when the cyclone is penetrating through the base. However,
it is much more convenient to operate with the ﬁeld of a thin ellipsoid shell to
avoid a necessity of the transition between two diﬀerent ﬁeld expressions.

To get formula for the shell ﬁeld, it is enough to accept c = ka and then to
diﬀerentiate gx (4) as a function of the variable a. This procedure results in the

0. For transition to the time domain, one
has to substitute x = vt, where v is the cyclone velocity.

≥

To illustrate a general type of the angular deﬂection dynamics, formulas (6)
and (7) were calculated numerically for several artiﬁcially selected laws of the
density variation over the cyclone. Four types of the density distributions were
considered, namely, “step,” “circle,” “harmonic” and “Gaussian” (see ﬁgure 2,
curves 1a–1d) with the same normalization of mean value and variance:

ρ(x)kx2dx = (π/2)¯ρa2

0c,

ρ(x)kx4dx = (π/2)¯ρa4

0c.

Corresponding plots are presented in ﬁgure 2. Density distributions used for
calculations are presented by curves 1a–1d and curves 2a–2d show the dynamics
of relative variations of the mirror’s plumb lines. For numerical calculations, it
was used v=1 m/sec and the other parameters were a0=300 km, c=10 km,
¯ρ=0.02 kg/m3 and L=3 km.

Figure 2 demonstrates a strong dependence of the mutual angular deﬂection
on the density distribution inside the cyclone. Common features are peaks
of deﬂection at the cyclone base borders and a suppression of perturbation
inside the cyclone. The amplitudes of peaks depend on the density structure
of the cyclone cloud. The homogeneous cloud produces the biggest jump of
deﬂection (case a). The Gaussian distribution minimizes the jump eﬀect (case
d). However, the best compensation of perturbations inside the cyclone takes

5

place just for the homogeneous model (here the mutual deﬂection is more close
to zero then in the other cases).

For the homogeneous model (case a), the integral in (6) can be calculated
analytically. Results of such calculation within the ﬁrst order accuracy of the

From ﬁgure 2 it is clear that a more favorable cyclone structure can be pre-
sented by a cloud with Gaussian fronts and long plane central zone. Then jump
perturbations corresponding to the cyclone front passing through the interfer-
ometer base are suppressed as well as perturbations in the central part of the
cloud. In general, large sharp perturbations (corresponding to relatively rare
events) can be obviously controlled by barometric measurements. At quiet at-
mospheric conditions, the usual daily variation is of the order of (1

Analysis presented in sections 1 and 2 elucidates particular characteristics of
the free mass interferometer such as a gravity gradiometer one. Being a gravity
device, it is aﬀected by all environmental movements of masses. But its transfer
function suppresses the inﬂuence of large scale homogeneous gravity sources by
the factor of the ratio of the base length to the source scale. The most eﬀective
sources would be those which generate the gravity ﬁeld with a space scale equal
to the interferometer base (or less). Such sources might have a typical variation
10 m/sec, so it would be high frequency
time of the order of tens seconds for v

sources with respect to the main geophysical processes with times equal to hours
and longer. It is clear also that, by suppressing the Newtonian environmental
noise, the gravity gradiometer suppresses equally low frequency (quasistatic)

signals arising from the objects being the aim for registration (including the
inner core oscillations). However, it cannot be a serious objection if instrumental
(intrinsic) noises of the device are enough small to permit measurements of such
very weak eﬀects. It seems that modern advanced technology of gravitational
interferometers under construction could meet these requirements.

3 Turbulent ﬂux efect

The previous consideration was carried out at the condition of the hydrostatic
atmosphere or, at least, slow laminar air currents. However, it is known that in
upper troposphere strata the Reynolds number can be very high Re> 106 and
appearance of turbulent currents is a typical event. The rigorous calculation
of the turbulent atmosphere gravity eﬀect is complicated due to an uncertainty
in constructing the models adequate to our problem, many unknown param-
eters and general complexity of the theory of turbulent atmosphere. For the
estimation of the order of magnitude of the gravity noise produced by the air
turbulence, we hope that a simple phenomenological consideration based on the
Kolmogorov–Obukhov (K-O) law [15] can be useful. This law ﬁxes relative vari-
ation of velocities of vortex zones with diﬀerent scales in the regime of developed
turbulence.

Let a be some maximum size of the turbulence zone with an average ampli-
tude of the velocity variations V . Then according to the K-O law, a velocity
standard vλ at the small scale λ

a obeys to the formula

For each λ, one can deﬁne the frequency of the velocity ﬂuctuation as f = V /λ.
Then (12) can be rewritten as

Following [16] the pressure standard ∆p is introduced in (10) through the hy-
drodynamic law at the scale λ:

Here the constant S0 can be determined by the condition of uninterrupted spec-

that the lowest conceivable frequency associated with the limited turbulence
zone is f1 = V /Re, where Re is the Earth radius. Below this point, the spectrum
of pressure variations remains to be uncertain at least within the framework of
the approach used.

This simple model of the turbulent atmosphere pressure spectrum does not
take into account all complex processes which could take place. So, experimental
observations of thunder storms in the frequency domain (10−2
10−4) Hz gives
the spectrum indices distributed, in average, between 2 and 4.25 and centered
in the point 3.5 [17], i.e.
larger than the K-O index 7/3. On the contrary, at
frequencies below 10−4, experimental data better agree with index 5/3 [18], i.e.
low frequency ﬂuctuations grow slowly than it is predicted by the ﬂicker type
noise with the spectrum index 3, and so on.

÷

Nevertheless, this model at the quiet atmosphere conditions corresponds
to the real experimental data by the order of magnitude. In particular, it was
successfully used for calculating the atmospheric load deformations measured by
strain meters at the Obninsk Seismic Station (see [16]). In ﬁgure 3 (adopted from
[16]), one can compare the model spectrum calculated for the turbulent zone
with kinetic parameters a = L = 18 km, V = ∆U = 3 m/sec and average density
ρ0 = 0.55 kg/m3 (corresponding altitude h = 8 km) with the experimental
pressure spectrum measured at the Obninsk Seismic Station. One can see a
satisfactory coincidence, at least, by the order of magnitude.

Now we discuss the gravity noise associated with a turbulent atmospheric
process. For this, let us consider the plane atmosphere with eﬀective altitude h
ﬁlled by the turbulent ﬂux as it was considered in section 2. The estimation of
gravity variations on the Earth surface is taken as follows

where the parameters in ﬁgure 3 used for numerical estimation are a=18 km,

This very approximate estimation is supported by experimental data pro-
vided by the barometric space pattern covered several hundred kilometers around
the Brussels [10]. Measured value of the pressure gradient along the East–West

4 Simulation of plumb lines deﬂection

To test a likelihood of our estimations, we carried out a simple computer simu-
lation of the angular dynamics of two separated plumb lines (pendula) in a vari-
able pressure ﬁeld. Real experimental data were kindly provided by Japanese
Weather Association. These data were collected by the Meteorological National
Geographical Institute at the area close to Tsukubo Scientiﬁc Center. The area
20x20 km was covered by 10 meteostations with an average intermediate dis-
tance 10 km. The pressure data were registered at each station with a sample
time 1 min. An accuracy of measurement was 0.01 %. The recorded signal
contained obvious diurnal oscillations of the pressure; the average value of these
100 Pa), meanwhile, the dif-
oscillations was 0.1 % of atmospheric pressure (
ferential pressure amplitude for neighbour stations had only 10 % accuracy.

For modeling the angular free-mass interferometer response, we used the
simple hydrostatic approach calculating the mutual angle between plumb lines

Our estimations as well as computer simulation of the pendula behaviour in
real variable pressure ﬁeld show that, under normal atmospheric conditions, the

Our rough approximations of gravity noises for the turbulent atmosphere
have shown that the high frequency tail of Newtonian atmospheric ﬂuctuations
can provide some diﬃculty for gravitational wave detection at very low frequen-

more adequate models of turbulent currents in the high atmosphere.

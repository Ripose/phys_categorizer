Abstract
We review recent results on the appearance of long-term persistence in climatic records and
how they can be used to evaluate climate models. The persistence can be characterized,
for example, by the correlation C(s) of temperature variations separated by s days. We
show that, contrary to previous expectations, C(s) decays for large s as a power law,
C(s) ∼ s−γ. For continental stations, the exponent γ is always close to 0.7, while for
stations on islands γ ∼= 0.4. In contrast to the temperature ﬂuctuations, the ﬂuctuations of
the rainfall usually cannot be characterized by long term power law correlations but rather
by pronounced short term correlations. The universal persistence law for the temperature
ﬂuctuations on continental stations represents an ideal (and uncomfortable) test bed for
the state of the art global climate models and allows to evaluate their performance.

1. Introduction

The persistence of weather states on short terms is a well-known phenomenon: A warm
day is more likely to be followed by a warm day than by a cold day and vice versa. The
trivial forecast that the weather of tomorrow is the same as the weather of today was,
in previous times, often used as a ”minimum skill” forecast for assessing the usefulness
of short term weather forecasts. The typical time scale for weather changes is about
one week, a time period which corresponds to the average duration of so-called “general
weather regimes” or “Grosswetterlagen”, so this type of short-term persistence usually
stops after about one week. On larger scales, other types of persistence occur, one of
them is related to circulation patterns associated with blocking [4]. A blocking situation
occurs when a very stable high pressure system is established over a particular region
and remains in place for several weeks. As a result the weather in the region of the high
remains fairly persistent throughout this period. Furthermore, transient low pressure
systems are deﬂected around the blocking high so that the region downstream of the
high experiences a larger than usual number of storms. On even longer terms, a source
for weather persistence might be slowly varying external (boundary) forcing such as sea
surface temperatures and anomaly patterns. On the scale of months to seasons, one of the
most pronounced phenomenon is the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event which
occurs every 3-5 years and which strongly aﬀects the weather over the tropical Paciﬁc as
well as over North America [16].

The question is, how the persistence that might be generated by very diﬀerent mech-
anisms on diﬀerent time scales, decays with time s. The answer to this question is not
easy. Correlations, and in particular long term correlations, can be masked by trends
that are generated, e.g., by the well known urban warming. Even uncorrelated data in

1

the presence of long-term trends may look like correlated ones, and, on the other hand,
long-term correlated data may look like uncorrelated data inﬂuenced by a trend.

Therefore, in order to distinguish between trends and correlations one needs methods
that can systematically eliminate trends. Those methods are available now: both wavelet
techniques (WT) (see e. g.
[1]) and detrended ﬂuctuation analysis (DFA) (see, e. g.
[15, 3]) can systematically eliminate trends in the data and thus reveal intrinsic dynamical
properties such as distributions, scaling and long-range correlations very often masked by
nonstationarities.

In recent studies [11, 5, 17] we have used DFA and WT to study temperature and
precipitation correlations in diﬀerent climatic zones on the globe. The results indicate
that the temperature variations are long range power law correlated above some crossover
time that is of the order of 10 days. Above 10d, the persistence, characterized by the
auto-correlation C(s) of temperature variations separated by s days, decays as

C(s) ∼ s−γ,
(1)
where, most interestingly, the exponent γ has roughly the same value γ ∼= 0.7 for all
continental records. For small islands the correlations are more pronounced, with γ around
0.4. This value is close to the value obtained recently for correlations of sea-surface
temperatures [12].
In marked contrast, for most stations the precipitation records do
not show indications of long range temporal correlations on scales above 6 months. Our
results are supported by independent analysis by several groups [13, 14, 18].

The fact that the correlation exponent varies only very little for the continental atmo-
spheric temperatures, presents an ideal test bed for the performance of the global climate
models, as we will show below. We present an analysis of the two standard scenarios
(greenhouse gas forcing only and greenhouse gas plus aerosols forcing) together with the
analysis of a control run. Our analysis points to clear deﬁciencies of the models. For
further discussions we refer to [7].

The article is organized as follows: In Section 2, we describe one of the detrending
analysis methods, the detrended ﬂuctuation analysis (DFA). In Section 3, we review the
application of this method to both atmospheric temperature and precipitation records.
In Section 4, ﬁnally, we describe how the ”universal” persistence law for the atmospheric
temperature ﬂuctuations on continental stations can be used to test the three scenarios
of the state-of-the-art climate models.

2. The methods of analysis

Consider, e.g., a record Ti, where the index i counts the days in the record, i = 1,2,...,N.
The Ti may represent the maximum daily temperature or the daily amount of precipita-
tion, measured at a certain meteorological station. For eliminating the periodic seasonal
trends, we concentrate on the departures of the Ti, ∆Ti = Ti − T i, from their mean daily
value T i for each calendar date i, say 1st of April, which has been obtained by averaging
over all years in the record.

Quantitatively, correlations between two ∆Ti values separated by n days are deﬁned

by the (auto) correlation function

C(n) ≡ h∆Ti∆Ti+ni =

∆Ti∆Ti+n.

If the ∆Ti are uncorrelated, C(n) is zero for n positive. If correlations exist up to a certain
number of days n×, the correlation function will be positive up to n× and vanish above
n×. A direct calculation of C(n) is hindered by the level of noise present in the ﬁnite
records, and by possible nonstationarities in the data.

To reduce the noise we do not calculate C(n) directly, but instead study the “proﬁle”

Ym =

∆Ti.

m

i=1

(3)

We can consider the proﬁle Ym as the position of a random walker on a linear chain after
m steps. The random walker starts at the origin and performs, in the ith step, a jump
of length ∆Ti to the right, if ∆Ti is positive, and to the left, if ∆Ti is negative. The
ﬂuctuations F 2(s) of the proﬁle, in a given time window of size s, are related to the
correlation function C(s). For the relevant case (1) of long-range power-law correlations,
C(s) ∼ s−γ,
0 < γ < 1, the mean-square ﬂuctuations F 2(s), obtained by averaging over
many time windows of size s (see below) asymptotically increase by a power law [2],

F 2(s) ∼ s2α, α = 1 − γ/2.

For uncorrelated data (as well as for correlations decaying faster than 1/s), we have
α = 1/2.

For the analysis of the ﬂuctuations, we employ a hierarchy of methods that diﬀer in
the way the ﬂuctuations are measured and possible trends are eliminated (for a detailed
description of the methods we refer to [10]).

(i) In the simplest type of ﬂuctuation analysis (FA) (where trends are not going to be
eliminated), we determine the diﬀerence of the proﬁle at both ends of each window. The
square of this diﬀerence represents the square of the ﬂuctuations in each window.

(ii) In the ﬁrst order detrended ﬂuctuation analysis (DFA1), we determine in each
window the best linear ﬁt of the proﬁle. The variance of the proﬁle from this straight line
represents the square of the ﬂuctuations in each window.

(iii) In general, in the n-th order DFA (DFAn) we determine in each window the best
n-th order polynomial ﬁt of the proﬁle. The variance of the proﬁle from these best n-th
order polynomials represents the square of the ﬂuctuations in each window.

By deﬁnition, FA does not eliminate trends similar to the Hurst method and the
conventional power spectral methods [6]. In contrast, DFAn eliminates trends of order n
in the proﬁle and n−1 in the original time series. Thus, from the comparison of ﬂuctuation
functions F (s) obtained from diﬀerent methods one can learn about long term correlations
and types of trends, which cannot be achieved by the conventional techniques.

3 Analysis of temperature and precipitation records

Figure 1 shows the results of the FA and DFA analysis of the maximum daily temper-
atures Ti of the following weather stations (the length of the records is written within
the parentheses): (a) Cheyenne (USA, 123 y), (b) Edinburgh (UK, 102 y), (c) Campbell
Island (New Zealand, 57 y), and (d) Sonnblick (Austria, 108 y). The results are typical
for a large number of records that we have analyzed so far (see [11, 5]). Cheyenne has
continental climate, Edinburgh is on coastlines, Campbell Island is a small island in the
Paciﬁc ocean, and the weather station of Sonnblick is on top of a mountain.

Figure 1: Analysis of daily temperature records of 4 representative weather stations. The
4 ﬁgures show the ﬂuctuation functions obtained by FA, DFA1, DFA2, DFA3, DFA4, and
DFA5 (from top to bottom) for the 4 sets of data. The scale of the ﬂuctuation functions
is arbitrary. In each panel, a line with slope 0.65 is shown as guide to the eye.

In the log-log plots, all curves are (except at small s-values) approximately straight
lines. For both the stations inside the continents and along coast lines the slope is
α ∼= 0.65. There exists a natural crossover (above the DFA-crossover) that can be best
estimated from FA and DFA1. As can be veriﬁed easily, the crossover occurs roughly
at tc = 10d, which is the order of magnitude for a typical Grosswetterlage. Above tc,
there exists long-range persistence expressed by the power-law decay of the correlation
function with an exponent γ = 2 − 2α ∼= 0.7. These results are representative for the large
number of records we have analyzed. They indicate that the exponent is ”universal” , i.e.
does not depend on the location and the climatic zone of the weather station. Below tc,
the ﬂuctuation functions do not show universal behavior and reﬂect the diﬀerent climatic
zones.

However, there are exceptions from the universal behavior, and these occur for loca-
tions on small islands and on top of large mountains. In the ﬁrst case, the exponent can
be considerably larger, α ∼= 0.8, corresponding to γ ∼= 0.4. In the second case, on top of
a mountain, the exponent can be smaller, α ∼= 0.58, corresponding to γ ∼= 0.84.

Next we consider precipitation records. Figure 2 shows the results of the FA and DFA
analysis of the daily precipitation Pi of the following weather stations (the length of the
records is written within the parentheses): Cheyenne (USA, 117 y) Fig. 2a, Edinburgh
(UK, 102 y) Fig. 2b, Campbell Island (New Zealand, 57 y) Fig. 2c and Sonnblick (Austria,
108 y) Fig. 2d. The results are typical and represent a large number of records that we
have analyzed so far (see [17]).

In the log-log plots, all curves are (except at small s-values) approximately straight
lines at large times, with a slope close to 0.5. If there exist long range correlations, then
they are very small. Some exceptions are again stations on top of a mountain, where
the exponent might be around 0.6, but this happens only very rarely. In most cases, the
exponent is between 0.5 and 0.55, pointing to uncorrelated or weakly correlated behavior

at large time spans. Unlike to the temperature records, the exponents actually do not
depend on speciﬁc climatic or geographic conditions.

Figure 3 summarizes the results for exponents α for (a) temperature records and (b)
precipitation records. Diﬀerent climatological conditions are marked in the histograms.
First we concentrate on the temperature records (Fig. 3a). One can see clearly that for
continental and coastline stations, the average exponent is close 0.65, with a variance of
0.03. For the islands (where only few records are available) the average value of α is 0.78,
with quite a large variance of 0.08. The variance is large, since stations on larger islands,
like Wrangelija, behave more like continental stations, with an exponent close to 0.65.
For the precipitation records (Fig. 3b), the average exponent α is close to 0.54, with a
variance close to 0.05, and does not depend signiﬁcantly on the climatic conditions around
a weather station.

Since for the temperature records the exponent for continental and coastline stations
does not depend on the location of the meteorological station and its local environment,
the power law behavior can serve as an ideal test for climate models where regional details
cannot be incorporated and therefore regional phenomena like urban warming cannot be
accounted for. The power law behavior seems to be a global phenomenon and therefore
should also show up in the simulated data of the global climate models (GCM).

4 Test of global climate models

The state of the art climate models that are used to estimate future climate are coupled
atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) [19, 8]. The models provide
numerical solutions of the Navier Stokes equations devised for simulating meso-scale to
large-scale atmospheric and oceanic dynamics. In addition to the explicitly resolved scales

of motions, the models also contain parameterization schemes representing the so-called
subgrid-scale processes, such as radiative transfer, turbulent mixing, boundary layer pro-
cesses, cumulus convection, precipitation, and gravity wave drag. A radiative transfer
scheme, for example, is necessary for simulating the role of various greenhouse gases such
as CO2 and the eﬀect of aerosol particles. The diﬀerences among the models usually lie
in the selection of the numerical methods employed, the choice of the spatial resolution
[20], and the subgrid-scale parameters.

Three scenarios have been studied by the models, and the results are available, for
4 models, from the IPCC Data Distribution Center [21]. The ﬁrst scenario represents a
control run where the CO2 content is kept ﬁxed. In the second scenario, one considers
only the eﬀect of greenhouse gas forcing (GHG). The amount of greenhouse gases is taken
from the observations until 1990 and then increased at a rate of 1% per year. In the third
scenario, also the eﬀect of aerosols (mainly sulphates) in the atmosphere is taken into ac-
count. Only direct sulphate forcing is considered; until 1990, the sulphate concentrations
are taken from historical measurements , and are increased linearly afterwards. The eﬀect
of sulphates is to mitigate and partially oﬀset the greenhouse gas warming. Although
this scenario represents an important step towards comprehensive climate simulation, it
introduces new uncertainties - regarding the distributions of natural and anthropogenic
aerosols and, in particular, regarding indirect eﬀects on the radiation balance through
cloud cover modiﬁcation etc. [9].

For the test, we consider the monthly temperature records from those four AOGCMs
where the three scenarios data are available from the Internet: CSIRO-Mk2 (Melbourne),
CCSR/NIES (Tokyo), ECHAM4/OPYC3 (Hamburg), and CGCM1 (Victoria, Canada).
We extracted the data for six representative sites around the globe (Prague, Kasan, Seoul,
Luling (Texas), Vancouver, and Melbourne). For each model and each of the three sce-
narios, we selected the temperature records of the 4 grid points closest to each site, and
bilinearly interpolated the data to the location of the site. Figure 4 shows representative
results of the ﬂuctuation functions, calculated using DFA3, for two sites (Kasan (Russia)

and Luling (Texas)) for the 4 models and the three scenarios. As seen in Fig. 4 most
of the DFA curves approach the slope of 0.5. However, the control runs seem to show a
somewhat better performance, i.e., many of them have a slope close to 0.65 (e.g., Lul-
ing (CSIRO-Mk2)), and the greenhouse gas only scenario show the worst performance.
The actual long term exponents α for the three scenarios of the 4 models for the 6 cities
are summarized in Fig. 5(a-c). Each histogram consists of 24 blocks and every block is
speciﬁed by the model and the city.

For the control run (Fig. 5a) there is a peak at α ∼= 0.65 but more than half of
the exponents are below α ∼= 0.62. For the greenhouse gas only scenario (Fig. 5b),
the histogram shows a pronounced maximum at α = 0.5. For best performance, all
models should have exponents α close to 0.65, corresponding to a peak of height 24 in
the window between 0.62 and 0.68. Actually more than half of the exponents are close
to 0.5, while only 3 exponents are in the proper window between 0.62 and 0.68. Figure
5c shows the histogram for the greenhouse gas plus aerosol scenario, where in addition
to the greenhouse gas forcing, also the eﬀects of aerosols are taken into account. For
this case, there is a pronounced maximum in the α window between 0.56 and 0.62 (more
than half of the exponents are in this window), while again only 3 exponents are in the
proper range between 0.62 and 0.68. This shows that although the greenhouse gas plus
aerosol scenario is also far from reproducing the scaling behavior of the real data, its
overall performance is better than the performance of the greenhouse gas scenario. The
bet performance is observed for the control run, which points to remarkable deﬁciencies
in the way the forcings are introduced into the models.

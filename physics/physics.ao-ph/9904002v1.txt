What caused the onset of the 1997–1998 El
Ni˜no?

Abstract

There has been intense debate about the causes of the 1997–1998
El Ni˜no. One side sees the obvious intense westerly wind events as the
main cause for the exceptional heating in summer 1997, the other em-
phasizes slower oceanic processes. We present a quantitative analysis
of all factors contributing to the onset of this El Ni˜no. At six months’
lead time the initial state contributes about 40% of the heating com-
pared with an average year, and the wind about 50%. Compared with
1996, these contributions are 30% and 90% respectively. As westerly
wind events are diﬃcult to predict, this limited the predictability of
the onset of this El Ni˜no.

The Problem

The 1997–1998 El Ni˜no was one of the strongest on record. Unfortunately,
its onset was not predicted as well as had been hoped (Pearce, 1997). In
spite of claims that an El Ni˜no could be predicted a year in advance, most
predictions (Stockdale et al., 1998; Ji et al., 1996; Huang and Schneider, 1999;
Kleeman et al., 1995) only started to indicate a weak event six months ahead
of time. There have therefore been suggestions that El Ni˜no depends not
only on internal factors, but also on external noise in the form of weather
events in the western Paciﬁc.

The classical picture of El Ni˜no (Bjerknes, 1966; Philander, 1990) is that
the usual temperature diﬀerence between the warm water near Indonesia and

1

the ‘cold tongue’ in the eastern equatorial Paciﬁc causes an intensiﬁcation of
the trade winds. These keep the eastern region cool by drawing cold water
to the surface. This positive feedback loop is kept in check by nonlinear
eﬀects. During an El Ni˜no the loop is broken: a decreased temperature
diﬀerence causes a slackening or reversal of the trade winds over large parts
of the Paciﬁc. This prevents cold water from reaching the surface, keeping
the surface waters warm and sustaining the El Ni˜no.

This picture leaves open the question how an El Ni˜no event is triggered
and terminated. A variety of mechanisms has been proposed. On long time
scales an unstable mode of the nonlinear coupled ocean-atmosphere system
may be responsible (Neelin, 1991), either oscillatory or chaotic. Other au-
thors stress the importance of a ‘recharge’ mechanism (Wyrtki, 1975; Jin,
1997), with a built-up of warm water in the western Paciﬁc preceding an El
Ni˜no. Another description on shorter time scales is in terms of reﬂections
of equatorial Rossby and Kelvin waves in the thermocline (the interface be-
tween warm surface water and the cold water below at about 100 m depth).
These would provide the negative feedback that sustains oscillations (Suarez
and Schopf, 1988; Battisti and Hirst, 1989; Kessler and McPhaden, 1995).
However, short-scale atmospheric ‘noise’ in the form of westerly wind events
in the western Paciﬁc may also be essential in triggering an El Ni˜no (Wyrtki,
1985; Kessler et al., 1995).

Here we trace the causes of the onset of last year’s El Ni˜no in May 1997
over the six months from 1 December 1996. This is the time scale over
which predictions are currently skillful. Although El Ni˜no is an oscillation of
the coupled ocean-atmosphere system, the analysis can be simpliﬁed by ﬁrst
studying the response of the ocean to forcing with observed wind stress and
heat ﬂux ﬁelds. This response contains all time delays. The other part of the
loop, the dependence of the wind stress and heat ﬂux on the ocean surface
temperature will be discussed separately.

The ocean model used is the Hamburg Ocean Primitive Equation Model,
hope (Frey et al., 1997; Wolﬀ et al., 1997) version 2.3, which is very similar
to the ocean component of the European Centre for Medium-range Weather
Forecasts (ecmwf) seasonal prediction system (Stockdale et al., 1998), but
restricted to the Paciﬁc Ocean. It is a general circulation model with a hor-
izontal resolution of 2.8◦, increased to 0.5◦ along the equator, and a vertical
resolution of 25 m in the upper ocean. It traces the evolution of temperature
T , salinity S, horizontal velocities u, v and sea level ζ.

This ocean model is forced with daily wind stress (τx, τy) and heat ﬂux

buoys (McPhaden et al., 1997) that observed this El Ni˜no. Evaporation and
precipitation are only implemented as a relaxation to climatological surface
salinity. The initial state conditions are ecmwf analysed ocean states. To
suppress systematic model errors we subtract a run starting from an average
1 December ocean state forced with average wind and heat ﬂuxes (both
1979–1996 averages (Gibson et al., 1997)).

The model simulates the onset of the 1997–1998 El Ni˜no quite well. We
use the nino3 index N3, which is a common measure of the strength of El
Ni˜no (the anomalous sea surface temperature in the area 5◦S–5◦N, 90◦W–
150◦W). In Fig. 1 the weekly observed nino3 index (Reynolds and Smith,
1994) is shown together with the index in the model run, compared to the
same period one year earlier. The model overreacts somewhat to the forcing
and simulates a nino3 index of 2.3 K at 1 June 1997, whereas in reality
the index reached this value one month later. In 1995–1996 the simulation
follows reality very well.

The Adjoint Model

The value of the nino3 index at the end of a model run can be traced back
to the model input (initial state, forcing) with an adjoint model. The normal
ocean model is a (complicated) function M that takes as input the state of
the ocean at some time t0 (temperature T0, salinity S0, etc.). Using the wind
stress ~τi and heat ﬂux Qi for each day i for six months it then produces a ﬁnal
state temperature Tn. The adjoint model (or backward derivative model) is
the related function that takes as input derivatives to a scalar function of
the ﬁnal state, here the nino3 index, ∂N3/∂Tn. It goes backward in time
and uses the chain rule of diﬀerentiation (Giering and Kaminski, 1998) to
compute from these (and the forward trajectory) the derivatives ∂N3/∂T0,
∂N3/∂S0, ∂N3/∂~τi and ∂N3/∂Qi. These derivatives can be interpreted as
sensitivity ﬁelds, giving the eﬀect of a perturbation in the initial state or
forcing ﬁelds. We can use them to make a Taylor expansion of the nino3
index to all the input variables:
N3 ≈ ∂N3

This means that the value of the index is explained as a sum of the inﬂuences
of initial state temperature and salinity, and the wind and heat forcing dur-
ing the six months of the run. These inﬂuences are each a dot product of the
sensitivity to this variable (computed with the adjoint model) multiplied by
its deviation from the normal state (extracted from the ecmwf analyses).
To minimize higher order terms we take the average derivative from the sim-
ulation and the climatology run. We have checked with actual perturbations
that the accuracy of the linear approximation Eq. 1 is usually better than
about 30% (within the model). Details can be found in van Oldenborgh et al.
(1999).

The 1997–1998 El Ni˜no

For the value of the nino3 index on 1 June 1997 the linearization Eq. 1 gives a
value of 1.8 K, compared with the 2.3 K simulated (and 1.3 K observed), this
is within the expected error. The high value is mainly due to the inﬂuence

4

of the westerly wind anomalies (1.0 K) and the initial state temperature
on 1 December 1996 (1.1 K). The salinity contributes −0.3 K, with a large
uncertainty.

The spatial structure of the inﬂuence of the initial state temperature is
shown in Fig. 2. The top panel gives the temperature anomaly δT0 along the
equator at the beginning of the run (Dec 1996), showing an unusually deep
thermocline in the western Paciﬁc and a shallower thermocline in the eastern
Paciﬁc. The second frame depicts the sensitivity of the June nino3 index to
temperature anomalies six months earlier, ∂N3/∂T0. The third frame is just
the product of the previous two; the integral of this over the whole ocean
gives the 1.1 K contribution to the nino3 index mentioned before. The
contribution is concentrated in the deeper layer of warm water along the
equator in the western Paciﬁc, in agreement with a ‘recharge’ mechanism.

Fig. 3 shows the time structure of the inﬂuence of the zonal wind stress.
The area under the solid graph gives the total inﬂuence, 1.0 K. The main
causes of warming are the three peaks in zonal wind stress (dashed line) at
the beginning of March, the end of March and the beginning of April, con-
tributing about 0.6 K, 0.3 K and 0.5 K respectively. The peaks correspond
with (very) strong westerly wind events in the western Paciﬁc. These gen-
erated downwelling Kelvin waves in the thermocline that travelled east and
deepened the layer of warm water in the eastern Paciﬁc 2–3 months later,
increasing the surface temperature. There was also a strong wind event in
December, contributing about 0.4 K over a negative baseline. From Fig. 3 it
seems likely that it increased the strength of the later wind events by heating
the eastern Paciﬁc in March. The heating eﬀect of the March wind event also
gave rise to an increase of the wind stress δτx in May, but this reversal of the
trade winds does not yet inﬂuence the nino3 index ∂N3/∂τx · δτx, justifying
the uncoupled analysis.

The structure of the peaks in Fig. 3 can be seen more clearly in spatial
views. In Fig. 4a the zonal wind stress anomaly δτx is plotted for the second
week of March. The westerly wind event corresponds to the large localized
westerly anomaly around 150◦E. Fig. 4b shows the sensitivity of the nino3
index in June to the zonal wind stress during this week, ∂N3/∂τx. This sen-
sitivity consists of two main parts, both equatorally conﬁned. In the western
and central Paciﬁc extra westerly wind stress would excite a downwelling
Kelvin wave, raising the nino3 index three months later. In the eastern Pa-
ciﬁc the response would be in the form of a Rossby wave. The product of the
anomaly and sensitivity ﬁelds is shown in Fig. 4c. This gives the inﬂuence

of zonal wind stress during this week on the nino3 index, the integral of
this ﬁeld gives the corresponding value (0.22 K) in Fig. 3. The inﬂuence is
contained in the intersection of the westerly wind event and the equatorial
wave guide, and very localized in time and space. The eﬀects of the other
wind events are similar.

The question remains whether the big inﬂuence of these wind events was
due to their strength δτx or to an increased sensitivity of the ocean ∂N3/∂τx.
We therefore repeated the analysis for the same months one year earlier, when
the temperature in the eastern Paciﬁc stayed below normal (Fig. 1). The
adjoint model gives a nino3 index of −0.6 K, equal to the simulated index
(the observed index was −0.7 K). This index is built up by a large negative
inﬂuence of the wind stress, −1.5 K, and a positive inﬂuence of the heat ﬂux,
+0.9 K. The inﬂuence of the initial state temperature is also positive, but
weaker than in the 1996–1997 +0.6 K, and the salinity contributes −0.5 K.
Although the built-up of warm water is also less pronounced, the largest
diﬀerence is in the inﬂuence of the zonal wind stress. The sensitivity to
zonal wind stress ∂N3/∂τx (over the area where its variability is largest) is
compared for these two years in Fig. 5. During the time of the strong early
March windevent the sensitivity was not very diﬀerent bewteen the two years,
but it was a factor two higher in April 1997 than in April 1996, and lower
during the ﬁrst two months.
In all, these diﬀerences cannot explain more
than a few tenths of a degree diﬀerence in the nino3 index on 1 June.

be attributed for about 30% to an even stronger built-up of warm water in
the western Paciﬁc, and for about 90% to the the absence of strong westerly
wind events in the western Paciﬁc in the 1995–1996 rain season. A successful
prediction scheme will have to predict the intensity of the westerly wind
events correctly. However, the year-to-year variability of these wind events
does not seem to depend on the state of the Paciﬁc ocean (Slingo et al.,
1999), and at the moment is not predictable.

Conclusions

Using an adjoint ocean model we have shown that a successful prediction of
the strong onset of the 1997–1998 El Ni˜no, required a successful prediction of
strong westerly wind events in March–April, which in our model contributed
about 90% to the strength of the El Ni˜no on 1 June 1997 compared to
the situation one year earlier. The sensitivity to these wind events was not
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the year before. The built-up of warm water
contributed about 30% of the diﬀerence. The strong dependence on the
westerly wind events would explain the relatively short lead time for correct
predictions of the strong onset of this El Ni˜no.

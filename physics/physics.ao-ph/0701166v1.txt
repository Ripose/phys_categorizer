Abstract

One possible method for predicting landfalling hurricane numbers is to ﬁrst predict the number
of hurricanes in the basin and then convert that prediction to a prediction of landfalling hurricane
numbers using an estimated proportion. Should this work better than just predicting landfalling
hurricane numbers directly? We perform a basic statistical analysis of this question in the context of
a simple abstract model.

1 Introduction

We are interested in trying to develop and compare methods for the prediction of the distribution of the
number of hurricanes that might make landfall in the US in future years. One class of possible methods
that one might use involves ﬁrst predicting the number of hurricanes in the Atlantic basin, and then
converting that prediction to a prediction of landfalling numbers using some estimate of the proportion
that might make landfall. Is this class of indirect methods likely to work any better than simpler methods
based on predicting the number of landfalls directly? On the one hand, the direct methods avoid having
to make any estimate of the way that basin hurricanes relate to landfalling hurricanes. On the other, there
are more hurricanes in the basin than at landfall and so it might be possible to predict basin numbers
more accurately than landfalling numbers (in some sense), and this accuracy might then feed through
into the landfall prediction.
In order to try and understand the relationship between these two methods a little better, we investigate
some of basic statistical properties of the direct and indirect methods for predicting future hurricane
rates.
In section 2 we present some basic statistical ideas that we will use in our analysis.
In section 3 we
set up the problem and derive expressions for the likely performance of the indirect method in a general
context. In section 4 we consider the performance of a set of simple prediction methods for basin hurricane
numbers. In section 5 we specialize our analysis to the case where the basin hurricane numbers are poisson
distributed. In section 6 we perform some Monte-Carlo simulations to check our approximations, and
ﬁnally in section 7 we describe our conclusions.

2 Background on conditioning

In this section we present some standard statistical results that we will use later.

2.1 Basic deﬁnitions

Consider two random variables X and Y with joint density fX,Y and marginals fX and fY . The density
of Y |(X = x) is deﬁned as

∗Correspondence email: stephen.jewson@rms.com

The conditional expectation is deﬁned as E(Y |X) = ψ(X) where

fY |X (y|x) =

where fX (x) 6= 0

fX,Y (x, y)
fX(x)

The conditional variance is deﬁned as var(Y |X) = ν(X) where

ψ(x) = E(Y |X = x) =

yfY |X (y|x)dy.

ZR

ν(x) = var(Y |X = x) =

[y − E(Y |X = x)]2fY |X (y|x)dy.

ZR

2.2 Disaggregation of the variance

From the deﬁnitions given above one can derive a useful expression that disaggregates the variance of Y
into conditional expectations and variances.

and

var(Y |X) = E(Y 2|X) − [E(Y |X)]2,

var(Y ) = E[var(Y |X)] + var[E(Y |X)].

2.3 Disaggregation of the variance of a product

From equation 5 we can then derive a useful method for disaggregating the variance of a product.
First, it is always true that

var(XY ) = E[var(XY |X)] + var[E(XY |X)]

= E[X 2var(Y |X)] + var[XE(Y |X)].

Now, if X and Y are independent we have E(Y |X) = E(Y ) and var(Y |X) = var(Y ) so

var(XY ) = E(X 2)var(Y ) + E(Y )2var(X)

= var(X)var(Y ) + E(X)2var(Y ) + E(Y )2var(X).

We will use these expressions below.

3 Basics of the conditional binomial model

We now set up our model. Overall our approach is to start with a very general mathematical framework
(e.g. we don’t initially assume that hurricane numbers are poisson distributed), derive what we can with
this level of generality, and make additional assumptions on the way through as and when necessary.
First, we need random variables for the annual numbers of hurricanes in the basin and at landfall, and
their historical totals. We deﬁne these as follows:

• Let {Xt : t = 1, . . . , n} be the sequence of annual historical hurricane numbers and let X =

• Let {Yt : t = 1, . . . , n} be the sequence of annual historical landfalling hurricane numbers and let

n
t=1 Xt.

P

Y =

n
t=1 Yt.

P

Now we consider estimating the proportion of hurricanes that make landfall, and the properties of the
most obvious estimator of that proportion. To start with, we don’t assume that the number of hurricanes
in the basin is poisson, but we do assume that the probability of hurricanes making landfall is constant
in time, and is the same for all hurricanes. We write this (unknown) probability as p. Then the number
of hurricanes that make landfall in a given year, given the number in the basin, is given by a binomial
distribution:

Yt|Xt ∼ binomial(Xt, p)

A useful analogy is that each basin hurricane is a coin toss, with a probability p of giving a head. The
number of hurricanes making landfall Yt is the number of heads in Xt tosses.
Extending this to the total number making landfall over n years, we also get a binomial:

Y |X1, . . . , Xn ∼ binomial(X, p)

3.1 Estimating the landfall proportion

The most obvious way to try and estimate p from the historical data is using the simple ratio of the total
number of historical landfalls to the total number of basin hurricanes:

ˆp = Y /X

What are the properties of this estimator? Is it unbiased, and what is the variance?
Wrt bias, ﬁrst we note that:

E(ˆp|X1, . . . , Xn) = p

and that

E(ˆp) = E(E(ˆp|X1, . . . , Xn))

= E(p)

= p

and we see ˆp is unbiased.
Wrt variance, a standard result for the binomial distribution is that:

Using equation 5, we can then decompose var(ˆp) as follows:

var(ˆp|X1, . . . , Xn) = p(1 − p)/X

var(ˆp) = E[var(ˆp|X1, . . . , Xn)] + var[E(ˆp|X1, . . . , Xn)]

= p(1 − p)E(1/X).

That is, the variance of the estimate of the proportion is given only in terms of the proportion itself and
E(1/X). The proportion can be estimated using a plug-in estimator, but the E(1/X) factor is slightly
harder to deal with, and can only be evaluated once we have settled on a distribution for X. We consider
this for the poisson distribution in section 5 below.

3.2 Landfall predictions

Now we consider making predictions of future landfalling hurricane numbers using the estimated propor-
tion ˆp, and a prediction of the mean number of basin hurricanes, which we write as µ = E(Xn+1). The
ﬁrst question is then how to estimate µ. One fairly general class of methods for estimating µ is to use the
historical data for the basin number of hurricanes in some way. We can write this as ˆµ = g(X1, . . . , Xn),
where g could be a linear or non-linear function of the historical data.
The most obvious reasonable forecast for the number of hurricanes making landfall is then ˆpˆµ. What are
the properties of this particular method?
We can establish the properties of this predictor as follows.
For the bias:

E(ˆpˆµ) = E(E(ˆpˆµ|X1, . . . , Xn))
= E(ˆµE(ˆp|X1, . . . , Xn))
= pE(ˆµ)

Note that if ˆµ is unbiased for E(Xn+1) then equation 20 implies that ˆpˆµ is unbiased for E(Yn+1) (this is
a stronger result than asymptotic unbiasedness).
For the variance:

var(ˆpˆµ) = E(var(ˆpˆµ|X1, . . . , Xn)) + var(E(ˆpˆµ|X1, . . . , Xn))
= E(ˆµ2var(ˆp|X1, . . . , Xn)) + var(ˆµE(ˆp|X1, . . . , Xn))
= E(ˆµ2p(1 − p)/X) + p2var(ˆµ)
= p(1 − p)E(ˆµ2/X) + p2var(ˆµ)

We consider various approximations to this expression in the next two sections, which will allow us to
evaluate it in certain situations.

4 Linear predictors of basin hurricane numbers

We now move on to consider linear predictors of the number of hurricanes in the basin i.e. methods that
use a weighted sum of historic values as an estimator of µ.
We write this as:

ˆµ =

wiXi.

n

Xi=1

This linear framework includes the mixed baseline models of Jewson et al. (2005), and models that use
linear regression of hurricane numbers on sea surface temperature.
To account for climate variability, the weights may be chosen to generate an estimator that uses only
recent data. For example:

wi =

0,
1
m ,

(cid:26)

for i = 1, . . . , n − m,
for i = n − m + 1, . . . , n.

Under this model it may, in some cases, be reasonable to suppose that ˆµ is generated so that cov(ˆµ2, 1/X)
is small relative to E(ˆµ2)E(1/X). Roughly speaking, this occurs if the errors we make when estimating
the proportion are not highly correlated with the errors we make when making the basin prediction.
If we can assume that the covariance term is small then we can make some useful simpliﬁcations to
equation 24, as follows:

var(ˆpˆµ) = p(1 − p)E(ˆµ2/X) + p2var(ˆµ)

= p(1 − p)[E(ˆµ2)E(1/X) + cov(ˆµ2, 1/X)] + p2var(ˆµ)
≈ p(1 − p)E(ˆµ2)E(1/X) + p2var(ˆµ)

5 Poisson model for basin hurricanes

We now specialize our analysis to the case where the number of hurricanes in the basin can be modelled
as a poisson distribution, which allows to approximate the E(1/X) term, and hence evaluate equations 17
and 29.
We start by assuming that the annual counts are poisson distributed, with the same poisson mean in
each year:

Then the total number of hurricanes over n years is also poisson distributed:

Xt ∼ poisson(µ) for all t

X ∼ poisson(nµ)

(statisticians usually prove this by inspection of moment generating functions).
At this point we brieﬂy mention a small mathematical problem, which is that we are now going to
consider 1/X, even though X, being poisson distributed, can take values of 0. To get around this
problem rigourously one can condition on X > 0, which would introduce a small adjustment factor
to the expressions derived below. We will, however, ignore this. Eﬀectively we are assuming that the
probability of X being zero is small, and this should be borne in mind when applying the results we
derive. This should be a reasonable assumption if X is the number of Atlantic basin hurricanes, but
would not reasonable if X we the number of category 5 Atlantic basin hurricanes, for instance.
Our approximation for E(1/X) is based on a Taylor expansion for the annual numbers:

E(1/Xt) = 1
µ

⇒ E(1/X) = 1
nµ

h
1 + 1

µ + 2 1
nµ + 2 1

µ2 + O( 1
µ3 )
i
1
n3µ3 )
i

n2µ2 + O(

h

Thus, to ﬁrst order, E(1/X) ≈ 1
If we take this ﬁrst order approximation and substitute it into equation 17 then we get:

nµ .

And if we substitute it into equation 29 we get

var(ˆp) ≈

p(1 − p)
nµ

,

var(ˆpˆµ) ≈

p(1 − p)E(ˆµ2)
nµ

+ p2var(ˆµ).

One simple prediction method for the mean number of hurricanes in the basin is to take a straight average
of m years of data. Given this,

and

In this case we get:

var(ˆµ) = µ/m

E(ˆµ2) = µ/m + µ2

= µ(1 + mµ)/m

var(ˆpˆµ) ≈

How accurate are these results based on the ﬁrst-order approximations? They will be reasonable if n is
large. Better approximations to var(ˆp) and var(ˆpˆµ) can easily be generated by using higher order terms
in the approximation of E(1/X).

6 Simulation tests

We now test the ﬁrst order approximation using Monte-Carlo simulations. We consider the following
situation:

• We estimate the mean number of hurricanes making landfalling using just the last 11 years of

landfalling data. This is one of our predictions.

• We estimate the mean number of basin hurricanes using the same 11 years of data

• We convert the basin estimate to an estimate for landfalling numbers using an estimated proportion,
which is based on between 11 and over 50 years of data. 11 of the years of data used to estimate
the proportion are the same data that is used to estimate the rates.

• We estimate the variances of all these predictions

Using Monte-Carlo simulations we can compare the variance estimate given by equation 39 with the real
variance estimates. The results are given in ﬁgure 1. The black-line gives the variance of the landfall
prediction based on 11 years of historical landfall data, from equation 36. The black-dots give estimates of
this variance based on the simulations. The blue-line gives our theoretical approximation to the variance
from the indirect method, based on equation 39. The coloured dots give estimates of the variance from
the indirect method based on the simulations. We see that:

• The theoretical estimate of the variance for the indirect method is in very good agreement with
the results from the simulations, even though we’ve only used a ﬁrst order approximation to derive
equation 39.

• The variance of the indirect method is lower than the variance of the direct method when the
proportion is estimated using more years of data than are being used for the rate estimates. Using
35 or more years of data makes the indirect method more than twice as accurate, in terms of
variance.

7 Conclusions

One possible way to predict landfalling hurricane numbers is to ﬁrst predict basin hurricane numbers and
then convert the basin numbers to landfall using an estimate of the proportion of the basin hurricanes
that make landfall. This method can be compared with the simpler method of just predicting landfall
numbers directly. We have performed some statistical analysis of these methods, to try and understand
which is likely to be more accurate. In particular we have considered a situation where the direct method
consists of estimating the landfall rates using an 11 year average of historical landfalling rates, and the
indirect method consists of estimating basin rates using an 11 year average and then converting that to
landfall rates using a proportion based on more than 11 years of data. Assuming that the probability of
individual hurricanes making landfall is constant in time then we have shown that the indirect method
is more accurate, and the more data is used to estimate the proportion, the more accurate it becomes
relative to the indirect method. Furthermore we have derived expressions for the variance of the indirect

method, and using simulations have shown that a simple analytic expression for the variance of the
indirect method works well.
The obvious remaining question is whether or not the probability of hurricanes making landfall really is
constant. In practice, it is undoubtedly not exactly constant. The question then becomes whether it is
suﬃciently close to being constant that the possible beneﬁts of the indirect method are realized.

Abstract

The aim of the article is to investigate the relative dispersion proper-
ties of the Well Mixed class of Lagrangian Stochastic Models. Dimensional
analysis shows that given a model in the class, its properties depend solely
on a non-dimensional parameter, which measures the relative weight of
Lagrangian-to-Eulerian scales. This parameter is formulated in terms of
Kolmogorov constants, and model properties are then studied by modify-
ing its value in a range that contains the experimental variability. Large
variations are found for the quantity g∗ = 2gC −1
0 , where g is the Richard-
son constant, and for the duration of the t3 regime. Asymptotic analysis
of model behaviour clariﬁes some inconsistencies in the literature and ex-
cludes the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process from being considered a reliable
model for relative dispersion.

Introduction

Relative dispersion is a process that depends on the combination of the Eulerian
and Lagrangian properties of turbulence. If particle separation falls in the iner-
tial subrange, the Eulerian spatial structure aﬀects the dispersion, which can be
regarded as a Lagrangian these property (Monin and Yaglom, 1975). The com-
bination of properties requires that both descriptions be considered (see e.g.,
Boﬀetta et al., 1999).

Lagrangian Stochastic Modelling (LSM) is one turbulence representation
that naturally combines Eulerian spatial structure and Lagrangian temporal cor-
relation. In fact, as formulated by Thomson (1990) using the Well Mixed Condi-
tion (WMC), Lagrangian and Eulerian statistics are accounted for through the
second order Lagrangian structure function and the probability density function
(pdf) of Eulerian velocity. Several studies prove that this approach leads to the
qualitative reproduction of the main properties, as expected from the Richard-
son theory (see Thomson, 1990; Reynolds, 1999; Sawford, 2001, among oth-
ers). Furthermore, recent experimental studies seem to conﬁrm the validity of

1

the Markovianity assumption for the velocity (Porta et al., 2001; Renner et al.,
2001; Mordant et al., 2001).

However, the intrinsic non-uniqueness of the WMC formulation (see, e.g.,
Sawford, 1999) and the indeterminacy of the Kolmogorov constants (see, e.g.,
Sreenivasan, 1995; Anfossi et al., 2000, for reviews) do not allow for a completely
reliable representation of the process. In particular, the value of the Richardson
constant predicted by previous studies is not uniquely determined (see, among
others, Thomson, 1990; Kurbanmuradov, 1997; Borgas and Sawford, 1994; Reynolds,
1999). Whether this indetermination is a result of the diﬀerent formulation of
models, or of the diﬀerent values of the parameters adopted is still unclear, and
no systematic studies have been performed so far.

It is worth noting that, even focusing attention only on the dependence on

the model constants produces signiﬁcant variability. As an example, Borgas and Sawford
(1994) present the variation of the Richardson constant value with the La-
grangian Kolmogorov constant C0.

The aim of this article is to investigate the general properties of models
based on the WMC with regard to inertial subrange relative dispersion features.
In Section 2 the properties of the WMC are evidenced through a dimensional
analysis, while the limit for vanishing spatial correlation is studied in Section 3.
Subsequently a model formulation is discussed in Section 4, and results analysed
in Section 5.

2 The non-dimensional form of the well mixed

condition

Following the logical development of Thomson (1987), Thomson (1990) (here-
inafter T90) extended the method for the selection of single particle Lagrangian
Stochastic Models to models for the evolution of particle pair statistics. In the
latter models, the state of a particle pair is represented by the joint vector of
position and velocity (x, u)
(x(1), x(2), u(1), u(2)), where the upper index de-
notes the particle, whose evolution is given by the set of Langevin type equations
(LE) (with implied summation over repeated indices):

≡

dxi = ui dt
dui = ai(x, u, t) dt + bij(x, t) dWj (t) ,

(cid:26)

(1)

where i, j = 1..6. The coeﬃcients a and b are determined, as usual, through
the well known Well Mixed Condition (Thomson, 1987) and the consistency
with the inertial subrange scaling, respectively. Further details are not given
here, in that they are well established and widely used in the literature (see,
e.g., Sawford, 2001, for a review). The only remark we would make is that,
although Thomson (1987) himself studied this alternative, the tensor bij cannot
be dependent on u in order to allow Eq. (1) to describe a physically meaningful
process. In fact, as shown, for instance, by van Kampen (1981), the Itˆo and
Stratonovich calculus give diﬀerent results when bij = bij(u). In particular, the
WMC would not have a unique deﬁnition. Thus, from now on, bij = √C0εδij,
i, j = 1..6 will be used according to the usual scaling of Lagrangian structure
function (Thomson, 1987), where ε is the mean dissipation rate of turbulent
kinetic energy.

2

It should be remembered here that the WMC is satisﬁed by constraining
the Fokker-Planck equation associated to Eq. (1) (see, e.g., Gardiner, 1990) to
be consistent with the Eulerian probability density function of the ﬂow. In the
case of particle pairs the considered pdf is the one-time, two-point joint pdf of
x(i) and u(i), i = 1, 2, accounting for the spatial structure of the turbulent ﬂow
considered. The open question about the non-uniqueness of the solution in more
than one dimension (see, e.g., Sawford, 1999) is not addressed here. However,
the following analysis will show that the problem studied is independent of the
particular solution selected.

In order to highlight the eﬀect of turbulence features on the model formula-
tion, characteristic scales for particle pair motion must be identiﬁed. Because
the process of relative dispersion has to deal with both Eulerian and Lagrangian
properties (see, e.g., Monin and Yaglom, 1975, p. 540), such scales can be de-
ﬁned by considering the second order Eulerian and Lagrangian structure func-
tions, i.e.,

from which one can retrieve the known relationship

suggested by Tennekes (1982). It should be observed that scales for the inertial
subrange, at variance with their integral version, can be deﬁned independently
of non-homogeneity or unsteadiness, provided that the scales of such variations
are suﬃciently large to allow an inertial subrange to be identiﬁed. As far as the
velocity is concerned, σ can be recognised as the appropriate scale of turbulent
ﬂuctuations in both descriptions.

The quantities σ, λ and τ can then be used respectively to make velocity
ui, position xi and time t non-dimensional. They also form a non-dimensional

connection to fundamental constants of the K41 theory.

and pE is the Eulerian one-time, two-point joint pdf of x and u.

An advantage of this choice of scales emerges clearly in Eq. (9). It shows that,
given a Eulerian pdf, once the non-uniqueness problem is solved by selecting
a suitable solution to Eq. (10), or applying a further physical constraint to
Eq. (11) (Sawford, 1999), any solution of Eq. (9) will depend on one parameter
only, namely on the Lagrangian-to-Eulerian scale ratio. It can also be observed
that this dependence is completely accounted for by the non-homogeneity term,
which is an intrinsic property of the particle pair dispersion process in spatially
structured velocity ﬁelds.

In looking for the universal properties of pair-dispersion in the inertial sub-
range, it is useful to rewrite the Richardson t3 law in non-dimensional form,
i.e., ∆x2 = g∗β2t3 where g∗ = 2g/C0. In this form, the numerical value of the
“normalised” Richardson constant g∗ depends on β only. This dependence is
investigated in the following Sections to highlight the intrinsic properties of the
LSM.

3 The spatial decorrelation limit

In the limit β
, corresponding to a vanishing Eulerian correlation scale, the
non-dimensionalisation deﬁned in the previous section fails to apply. However,
in this limit, the WMC solution can be proven to reduce to an homogeneous
In particular, selecting a Gaussian pdf will give the

Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process. It is worth noting that the OU process has
sometimes been used to describe Lagrangian velocity in turbulent ﬂows, for in-
stance by Giﬀord (1982), who pioneered the stochastic approach to atmospheric

4

dispersion. The Novikov (1963) model and the NGLS model (Thomson, 1990,
p. 124) are simple applications of this concept.

Adopting the choices made in the previous Section, but using the spatial
scale deﬁned by τ σ rather than the vanishing λ as a length scale, the OU
process equivalent to Eq. (8) is described by the non-dimensional set of linear
LE

where i = 1..6. The equations for the relative quantities (∆ui, ∆xi) can be
obtained from the diﬀerence between quantities relative to the ﬁrst (i = 1, 2, 3)
and second (i = 4, 5, 6) particles. The resulting set of equations reads

4 Model formulation and numerical simulations

In order to proceed with the analysis of the dependence of model features on
parameter β, we select as a possible solution to Eq. (10), the expression given
by T90 (his eq. 18) for Gaussian pdf. The spatial structure is accounted for
using the Durbin (1980) formula for longitudinal velocity correlation, which is
compatible with the 2/3 scaling law in the inertial subrange. Although this form
is known not to satisfy completely the inertial subrange requirements (it pre-
scribes a Gaussian distribution for Eulerian velocity diﬀerences, while inertial
subrange requires a non-zero skewness), it has been successfully used in ba-
sic studies (Borgas and Sawford, 1994) and applications (Reynolds, 1999), and
provides a useful test case for studying the results shown above.

The stochastic model is formulated for the variable (x, u) rather than for the
variable (∆x/√2,∆u/√2) as in Thomson’s original formulation. In the present

Using the above formulation, Eqs. (8) were solved numerically for a num-
ber of trajectories large enough to provide reliable statistics for the relevant
quantities. Particular attention was paid to the time-step–independence of the
solution (details are not reported here). It was found that the time step strongly
depends on β because large values of the parameter increase non-homogeneity,
which requires greater accuracy. Despite the widespread use of variable–time-
step algorithms (see, e.g., Thomson, 1990; Schwere et al., 2002) based, in par-
ticular, on spatial derivatives, here a ﬁxed time step short enough for time-step
independence of the solution was used throughout the computation.

Simulations were performed for two diﬀerent initial conditions for velocity
diﬀerence: i) the distributed case, where velocity diﬀerences are given according
∆u2
i i0 =
to the second-order Eulerian structure function and ii) the delta case (
h
0), where both particles of a pair are released with the same velocity, which is
normally distributed with variance 1. The two cases correspond to the limiting
cases considered in Section 3. The former describes “real” ﬂuid particles, i.e.,
particles distributed like ﬂuid at all times, while the latter represents, from the
point of view of relative dispersion, marked particles leaving a “forced” source,
where they were completely correlated (as for a jet). The initial condition for
the spatial variable was ∆x0 = 10−5β for all simulations.
It can be noted

6

that this corresponds to diﬀerent positions in the inertial subrange for diﬀerent
simulations (∆x0 diﬀers from case to case). However, the dimensional λ∆x0 is
chosen small enough to provide at least three decades of inertial subrange.

The β parameter was varied in the range [10−2 : 102], well beyond physically
meaningful values. In fact, values reported in the literature range from O(10−1)
to O(101) (Hinze, 1959; Hanna, 1981; Sato and Yamamoto, 1987; Koeltzsch,
1999) with β = O(1) taken as a reference (Corrsin, 1963). This choice was
made in order to infer asymptotic properties of the model. Note that, from
a numerical point of view, diﬀerent values of β were obtained by varying the
length scale λ, keeping σ, τ and C0 ﬁxed. In other words, with reference to
Eq. (7), the variation of β was obtained by varying CK.

5 Results and discussion

∞

Figures 1 (from a to i) show the results of simulations for the two initial con-
β−2
ditions and for diﬀerent values of β. The non-dimensional quantity
i
is plotted against the non-dimensional time t. The OU analytical solutions
(β =
) are reported for reference. The general behaviour qualitatively ﬁlﬁlls
the expectations of Taylor (1921) and Richardson (1926). It presents an initial
ballistic regime which diﬀers for the two cases: the distributed case shows a
t2, while the delta case presents a “false”1 t3 according to Eq. (16). After the
ballistic regime there is a transition to an inertial range t3 regime, which then
becomes well established until a pure diﬀusive regime takes place.

∆x2
h

This generically correct behaviour merits further consideration. A “true” t3
is observed, which depends on the spatial ﬂow structure and inﬂuences disper-
sion properties. In particular, increasing β causes an increase in the normalised
Richardson coeﬃcient g∗ (Fig. 2). It is worth noting that the “false” t3 regime,
according to the ﬁndings reported in Sect. 3, is not dependent on the structure,
and therefore does not vary with β. In fact, as pointed out by Sawford (2001),
t0, t0 being the time
there should be a range where
at which memory of the initial conditions is lost (see also Borgas and Sawford,
1991). It is clear now that this regime does not originate from any spatial struc-
ture and is intrinsic to the solution with the delta initial condition, as explained
by Eq. (16).

β−2 = 4t3 for t
i

∆x2
h

≪

According to Monin and Yaglom (1975, p. 541), the “true” t3 regime should
be independent of the initial conditions. Thus, the starting point of this regime
can be selected at the point where the solutions for the two cases coincide, as
clearly occurs in Figs. 1d to f. Therefore, the temporal extension of the t3 regime
is probably shorter than the one that could be estimated using intersections with
the idealised ballistic regime, on the one hand, and with the diﬀusive regime,
on the other. Note, however, that the extension of the inertial regime remains
a decreasing function of β, which asymptotically converges to zero.

Another point of interest evident in Figs. 1 and 2 is that the present re-
sults do not agree with the theoretical ﬁndings of Borgas and Sawford (1991)
(hereinafter BS91), although they compare well with the numerical results of
Borgas and Sawford (1994) (hereinafter BS94). In fact, BS94 (their last ﬁgure)
showed the results obtained by varying C0 in their models. However, as shown
1In the sense that it is only a correction to the ballistic t2 regime, which depends on the

initial conditions and not on spatial structure.

in Sect. 2, β is the only parameter on which the model depends. Because of
the constancy of ε in BS94, the varation of C0 corresponds to a variation of τ ,
and hence β. The results of BS94 for the implementation of the T90 model are
reported in Fig. 2, and show a complete agreement with the present results. The
γ, where γ
values indicated do not satisfy the kinematic constraint g = 2C0 −
is a positive quantity, proposed by BS91, based on a double asymptotic expan-
sion. It should be observed, however, that γ is derived from kinematic features
and depends on integrals of correlation functions. For vanishing correlation, one
obtains γ
0, suggesting that in BS91 the ballistic part of the OU process is
an upper limit for dispersion in the Richardson regime.

Nevertheless, this discrepancy can be explained as follows. From Eq. (16)
it is clear that, at any time t < tdiﬀ, where tdiﬀ is the time when pure dif-
fusion takes place, the displacement variance for the OU process in the dis-
tributed case is always larger than the displacement variance for the OU process
in the delta case. The two cases represent the limit for any process based

more, T90(distributed) < OU(distributed) for any ﬁnite β.
It can be con-
cluded that a β′ must exist for which T90(distributed) = OU(delta), and
T90(distributed) > OU(delta) for β > β′, in disagreement with BS91. Re-
calling that the OU process is the limit for any WMC process with Gaussian
pE, this result can be considered to be applicable to more general kinematic
properties, which should therefore depend on the ratio between Eulerian and
Lagrangian scales. Thus, the limitation to g∗ in the BS91 derivation possibly
derives from an implicit assumption concerning the spatial structure and/or the
value of β, which deﬁnes a range of applicability of the result.

Proceeding further with the analysis, it can also be said that, because of the

11

existence of a time t0 after which the solution is not dependent on the initial
conditions, it might be expected that T90(distributed) = T90(delta) for t > t0.
However, as the Lagrangian time increases with respect to σ−1λ, an increasing
number of particle pairs reaches the end of the inertial range (∆x
1) still
remembering their initial conditions. This results in a range of β > 1 in which
the delta solution never reaches the distributed solution before the onset of the
diﬀusive regime. Therefore, it is not possible to deﬁne any g∗. Nevertheless, for
β > β′ there exists a range of t where T90(delta) > OU(delta), which shows
that T90(delta) converges to OU(delta) in a non-monotonic way.

≫

When, for β . 1, the expected independence on the initial conditions is
recovered, it can be noted that t0 itself is a function of β. Thus, the duration
of the t3 regime depends also (and mainly) on the starting time of the diﬀusive
regime It is observed that decreasing β increases the time at which the diﬀusion
regime becomes fully developed.

6 Conclusions

The dimensional analysis of the WMC, through the non-dimensionalisation of
the Fokker-Planck equation has shown that only one parameter plays a role in
the determination of two particle dispersion properties. This parameter is the
Lagrangian-to-Eulerian scale ratio β, which can be reliably deﬁned in terms of
inertial subrange constants. The dimensional analysis leads to the deﬁnition
of a normalised Richardson constant g∗ whose scale is identiﬁed with C0, as
suggested by the comparison of Lagrangian and Eulerian properties. Given a
particular model, the numerical value of g∗ depends solely on the value of β
adopted. This also applies to the duration of the t3 regime.

→ ∞

Using the T90 formulation, it has been shown that the results of Novikov
(1963) are recovered for β
, which means that in the model the spatial
structure is negligible with respect to the Lagrangian time correlation. This
limit corresponds to the OU process, whose general properties highlight that the
observed t3 growth is actually a correction to the ballistic regime t2. Moreover,
because of the absence of any genuine t3 regime, it is not possible to deﬁne any
Richardson coeﬃcient. This means that 2C0 cannot be considered in general
as the upper limit for g. Therefore there is no inconsistency in models that
produce g > 2C0, as occurs in the present study and in BS94.

where the factor ∆r−h conserves the normalization and, for the constant values

and the spatial decorrelation limit, respectively.

Using the dimensional quantities ∆r′ = λ∆r and ∆u′ = σ∆u for the particle
separation and the velocity diﬀerences, respectively, for any ﬁnite Lagrangian
correlation time τ and particle separation ∆r′, the following identity holds

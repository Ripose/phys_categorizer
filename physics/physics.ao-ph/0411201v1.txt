We present a mean-ﬁeld model that describes droplet growth due to condensation and collisions
and droplet loss due to fallout. The model allows for an eﬀective numerical simulation. We study how
the rain initiation time depends on diﬀerent parameters. We also present a simple model that allows
one to estimate the rain initiation time for turbulent clouds with an inhomogeneous concentration of
cloud condensation nuclei. In particular, we show that over-seeding even a part of a cloud by small
hygroscopic nuclei one can substantially delay the onset of precipitation.

1. Introduction

Droplets start growing by vapor condensation on
cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) which are typically
submicron-size particles. In warm clouds, coalescence
due to collisions contributes the growth until the rain-
drops (generally exceeding millimeters) fall out of the
cloud, see e.g. Pruppacher and Klett (1997). Those
processes can be modelled by the equation for the local
distribution of droplets over sizes, n(a, t, r) = n(a) and
the mass content of the water vapor, M (t, r):

side of (1) is due to condensation which (for not very
large droplets) changes the droplet size a according to
da2/dt = κsM/ρ0 where κ is vapor diﬀusivity, s is the
degree of supersaturation and ρ0 = 103 kg · m−3 is the
density of liquid water. The time needed for condensa-
tion to grow a droplet of size a is generally proportional
to a2. The second term in the rhs of (1) describes co-
alescence due to collisions, here a′′ = (a3 − a′3)1/3 is
the size of the droplet that produces the droplet of
size a upon coalescence with the droplet of size a′.
The collision kernel is the product of the target area
and the relative velocity of droplets upon the contact:
K(a, a′) ≃ π(a+a′)2∆v. According to the recent precise
measurements (Beard et al, 2002) the coalescence eﬃ-
ciency of the droplets in the relevant intervals is likely to
be greater than 0.95 we put it unity in our calculations.
Collisions change the concentration n(a) on a timescale
of order 1/K(a, a1)n(a1) where collision kernel K is a
fast growing function of droplet sizes.

Since condensation slows down and coalescence ac-
celerates as the size of droplets grow then one can in-
troduce a crossover scale a∗, determined by K(a∗)n ≃
κsM/ρ0a2
∗. The growth up to the crossover scale is
mainly due to condensation while coalescence provides

for the further growth. The crossover scale a∗ depends
on n and is typically in tens of microns (see below).

To describe the six unknown functions, n, M, s, v,
one must also add the equation that describes the tem-
perature change (that determines s) and the Navier-
Stokes equation for the velocity. Such system cannot be
possible solved numerically with any meaningful resolu-
tion neither presently nor in a foreseeable future. The
main problem is a very complicated spatial structure of
the ﬁelds involved particularly due to cloud turbulence.
Our aim in this paper is to formulate some mean-ﬁeld
model which does not contain spatial arguments at all.
The requirements to this model is that it must give
the correct qualitative relations between the parameters
and reasonable quantitative description (at least within
the order of magnitude) of the real-world timescales.
According to the two basic phenomena involved (con-
densation and collisions), the main problems in space-
averaging the equations are related to the proper de-
scription of the two phenomena: mixing and diﬀusion
of water vapor and the inﬂuence of cloud turbulence
on collisions. We address them in Sections 4 and 3 re-
spectively. We use the model to study the evolution of
n(a, t) starting from sub-micron sizes all the way to the
moment when droplet fallout signiﬁcantly decreases the
water content in the cloud. We shall call this moment
the rain initiation time and we study how that time de-
pends on initial vapor content and CCN concentration
and on the level of air turbulence.

2. Growth by gravitational collisions

For the parameters typical for warm precipitating
clouds (sM/ρ0 = 10−8 ÷ 10−9 and n = 106 ÷ 109 m−3),
collisions are negligible for micron-size droplets (Prup-
pacher and Klett 1997). For droplets larger than couple
of microns, Brownian motion can be neglected and the
collision kernel in a still air is due to gravitational set-
tling:

The fall velocity ug is obtained from the balance of
gravity force 4πgρ0a3/3 and the friction F (ug, a). The
friction force depends on the Reynolds number of the
ﬂow around the droplet, Rea ≡ uga/ν. When Rea
is of order unity or less, F = 6πνρaug and ug = gτ
where ρ is the air density and τ = (2/9)(ρ0/ρ)(a2/ν)
is called Stokes time. We use ug = gτ for a < 40µm
and take ug(a) from the measurements of Gunn and
Kinzer (1949) for a > 50µm with a smooth interpola-
tion for 40µ m < a < 50µ m as shown in Fig 1. The
dotted straight lines have slopes 2, 1, 1/2. One can see
that ug ∝ a2 at a < 40 µm. There is an intermediate
interval with an approximately linear law ug ∝ a for

40 µm < a < 400µm. When Rea ≫ 1 one may expect
F ∝ ρa2u2
g as long as droplet remains spherical; that
gives ug ∝
agρ0/ρ. Square-root law can be distin-
guished between 400 µm and 1 mm while the growth of
ug(a) saturates at larger a due to shape distortions. Hy-
drodynamic interaction between approaching droplets
is accounted in Kg by the collision eﬃciency E, which
values we take from Pinsky et al (2001) at the 750 mbar
altitude.

It is of practical use to be able to predict the time
left before rain starts given the knowledge of droplet
distribution at a given instant. Such distributions can
be measured with high accuracy by optical and other
methods. Drop size distributions measured in many dif-
ferent types of clouds under a variety of meteorological
conditions often exhibit a characteristic shape (Prup-
pacher and Klett, 1997). Generally the concentration
rises sharply from low value maximum, and then de-
creases gently toward larger sizes, causing the distri-
bution to be positively skewed with a long tail toward
the larger sizes. We approximate such a shape with
half-Gaussian θ(a − a0) exp(−(a − a0)2/2σ2) where θ is
a step function. We thus characterize the distribution
by two parameters: the mean position P and the width
σ. Since we mainly consider narrow initial distributions
(σ ≪ P ), the rain initiation time does not depend sub-
stantially on the initial shape. We start from purely
gravitational collisions in a still air that is solve the
space-homogenous version of (1) with no condensation

The ﬁrst term in the rhs of (4) models the loss of
droplets falling with the settling velocity ug from the
cloud of the vertical size L. Since L are generally
very large (from hundreds meters to kilometers) and
ug(a) grows with a (see Fig. 1 below), fallout is rele-
vant only for suﬃciently large drops (called raindrops)
with sizes millimeter or more. The collision (Smolu-
chowsky) term describes the propagation of distribu-
tion towards large sizes. The asymptotic law of propa-
gation depends on the scaling of Kg(a, a′). If the colli-
sion kernel is a homogeneous function of degree α [that
is Kg(ξa, ξa′) = ξαKg(a, a′)] one can show that for
α larger/smaller than three the propagation is accel-
erating/decelerating while for α = 3 it is exponential
ln a ∝ t (see van Dongen and Ernst 1988; Zakharov et
al 1991). Our numerics show, however, that the inter-
vals of sizes a where α is approximately a constant are
too short for deﬁnite self-similarity of the propagation
to form both for narrow and wide initial distributions.
This is due to complexity of both functions, ug(a) and
E(a, a′). We thus focus on the most salient feature of
the propagation, namely study how the amount of wa-
ter left in the cloud, W , depends on time. The decrease
of that amount is due to a concerted action of collisions
producing large drops and fallout.

The droplets radii space was discretized, i.e.

the
droplets size distribution n(a, t) was presented as the set
of concentrations ni(t) of droplets with radius ai. The
total mass of vapor and water in droplets is conserved
in our calculations. The grid of radii was taken approx-
imately exponential at sizes that are much larger than
the size of initial condensation nuclei, with 256 points in
unit interval of natural logarithm. The collision term in
Smoluchowsky equation was treated as follows: let the
radius (a3
j )1/3 of the droplet resulted from merging
of the two with radii ai and aj to be in between of two
radii ak and ak+1 from the grid. Then the collision re-
sults in decreasing of ni and nj by quantity dN that is
determined by the collision kernel, while the concentra-
tions nk and nk+1 are increased in such a way that sum
of their change is dN and the whole amount of water in
droplets is conserved in coalescence:

δni = δnj = −dN = −δnk − δnk+1 ,

The total amount of water (the sum of the part that
left and remained in the cloud) was a conserved quan-
tity, up to 10−6 accuracy, during the whole simulation.

Note that our scheme automatically keeps the numbers
positive: if dN is greater than either ni or nj, then we
choose dN = min{ni, nj}, so that ni and nj are also
not negative after every elementary collision process.
Let us stress that our scheme is conservative both in
mass and number of droplets (comparing to the non-
conservative scheme of Berry and Reinhardt, 1974 and
the scheme of Bott, 1998 which was conservative only in
mass and needed special choice of the time step to keep
positivity). The minimal time step needed for our cal-
culations was estimated from characteristic timescales
of our problem to be 0.1 s. We have checked that the
decrease of the time step below dt = 0.05 s does not
change the results, the ﬁgures below all correspond to
that dt.

The graphs W (t) are shown at Figs 2 and 3 (for L = 2
km) and they are qualitatively the same both for narrow
and wide initial distributions. At the initial stage, W
decreases slowly due to the loss of drizzle. After large
raindrops appear, loss accelerates. At every curve, the
star marks the moment when respective d2W/dt2 are
maximal. After that moment, the cloud looses water
fast so it is natural to take t∗ as the beginning of rain.
Figure 4 shows how the mass distribution over sizes,
m(a) ∝ a3n(a) evolves with time. One can see the ap-
pearance of secondary peaks and distribution propagat-
ing to large a. The moment t∗ seems to correspond to
the highest value of the envelope of the curves m(a, t)
of the coalescence-produced drops. One can see from
Figure 4 that the peak at mass distribution is around
200 microns and most of the droplets are below 500 mi-
crons at t = t∗. The same character of the evolution
W (t) can be seen in the next section for the ab initio
simulations of (1,2).

The rain initiation time t∗ deﬁned in that way is

presented in Figures 5 and 6 against the width and the
position of the initial distribution. Note the dramatic
increase in t∗ with decreasing σ for P = 13 µm. The
mean droplet size P = 14 µm is sometimes empirically
introduced as the minimal size required for the onset of
precipitation (Rosenfeld and Gutman 1994). Figures 5
and 6 support that observation, they indeed show that
t∗ grows fast when P decreases below that size but only
for very narrow initial distributions and of course there
is no clear-cut threshold as t∗(P ) is a smooth (though
steep) function. The timescales (from tens of minutes to
hours) are in agreement with the data obtained before
(see Pruppacher and Klett, 1997, Chapter 15; and Se-
infeld, J. and S.Pandis, 1998, Chapter 15 and the refer-
ences therein). Figure 6 also shows that for 15 µm ∼< P ,
the function t∗(P ) can be well-approximated by a power
law t∗ ∝ P −γ with γ ≈ 3. The rain initiation time de-
pends on the cloud vertical size almost logarithmically
as shown in Fig. 7, we do not have an explanation for
this functional form.

Here we treated the position and the width of the
distribution as given at the beginning of the collision
stage. But of course the distribution is itself a product
of condensation stage so we now turn to the considera-
tion of the full condensation-collision model.

If one substitutes here gravitational and Brownian col-
lision kernels (taken, e.g.
from Pruppacher and Klett
1997) and start from n = 107 ÷ 108 m−3 sub-micron
droplets growing in a medium with sM/ρ0 = 10−8 ÷
10−9 then (6,7) give unrealistically large rain initiation
time. The reason for that is well-known: during the
condensation stage, the distribution shifts to larger sizes
while keeping its small width over a2. For narrow dis-
tributions, gravitational collisions are suppressed (since
all droplets fall with close velocities) as we have seen in
the previous section. Collisions of droplets with similar
sizes are provided by an inhomogeneous air ﬂow. The
velocity gradient λ provides for the kernel Ks = λ(a+a′)3
derived in Saﬀman and Turner (1956). However, typical
velocity gradients in the air turbulence (λ ≃ 10−30 s−1)
also do not provide enough collisions (see e.g. Prup-
pacher and Klett 1997; Jonas 1996; Vaillancourt and
Yau 2000, and the referenced therein) . Regular ver-
tical inhomogeneity of supersaturation due to temper-
ature proﬁle does not broaden n(a) much even with
the account of turbulence-induced random ﬂuctuations
(Korolev 1995; Turitsyn 2003). Spatial inhomogeneities
in vapor content M due to mixing of humid and dry
air still remains a controversial subject (see. e.g Prup-
pacher and Klett 1997; Baker et al, 1980) and proba-
bly can be neglected in cloud cores. We address the
turbulent mixing of vapor in Section 4 considering par-
tially seeded clouds. We address the turbulent mix-
ing of vapour in Section 4 considering partially seeded
clouds. As far as collisions are concerned, the main ef-
fect of spatial inhomogeneities seems to be the eﬀect of
preferential concentration that is of turbulence-induced
ﬂuctuations in droplets concentration (see Maxey 1987;
Squires and Eaton 1991; Sundaram and Collins 1997;
Reade and Collins 2000; Grits et al 2000; Shaw et
al 1998; Kostinski and Shaw 2001, and the references
therein). We use here the results of the recent the-
ory by Falkovich et al (2002). Namely, we multiply the
Saﬀman-Turner collision kernel Ks by the enhancement
factor hn1n2i/hn1ihn2i (which accounts for the eﬀects
of inertia and gravity in a turbulent ﬂow) and add the
collision kernel due to the so-called sling eﬀect (droplets
shot out of air vortices with too high centrifugal accel-
eration), see Falkovich et al (2002) and Falkovich and
Pumir (2004) for the details. The total collision kernel
due to turbulence normalized by the homogeneous ex-
pression 8λa3 factor is presented in Fig. 8 for Re = 106.
We see that role of concentration inhomogeneities can
be substantial in the interval between 30 and 60 µm.

large concentrations (generally for continental clouds),
n > n∗, the rain initiation time is mainly determined
by collisions so it is getting independent of the super-
saturation and t∗ ∝ n(α−3)/3M −α/3.

By numerically solving (6,7) with both gravity and
turbulence-induced collisions we obtain the rain initia-
tion time (also deﬁned by the maximum of d2W/dt2)
as a function of the CCN concentration n for diﬀerent
values of the supersaturation s and the vapor content
M . The grid of radii was approximately exponential at
sizes that are much larger than the size of initial con-
densation nuclei (with 200 points in unit interval of nat-
ural logarithm). The condensation of vapor was taken
into account by working on evolving grid of radii ai(t)
keeping conserved the total mass of water in droplets
and vapor. Collisions were modelled according to (5)
described above. Note that the numerical scheme we
employ here has an additional advantage (comparing to
those described in Pruppacher and Klett, 1997; Berry
and Reinhardt, 1974; Bott, 1998) of accounting simulta-
neously for condensation and collisions while respecting
conservation laws. We used the time step dt = 0.01 s
during the condensation phase, on a later stage (domi-
nated by coalescence) dt = 0.1 s was enough. Those re-
sults are presented in Figure 9 for L = 2 km and λ = 20
s−1. The solitary point at the lower part corresponds to
M = 6 g· m−3, s = 1/150. The three solid lines corre-
spond to M = 3 g· m−3 while the three dashed lines to
M = 1.5 g· m−3. Inside the triplets, the lines diﬀer by
the values of the supersaturation, from bottom to top,
s = 1/75, 1/150, 1/300. We see that indeed the graphs
t∗(n) all have minima. The position of the minimum is
proportional to M as expected and approximately pro-
portional to s−1/2 which would correspond to α ≃ 7
in this interval of sizes. We see that the left parts of
diﬀerent curves with the same product sM approach
each other as n decreases. To the right of the minima,
the curves with diﬀerent s but the same M approach
each other as n increases. That supports the previous
conclusions on the respective roles of condensation and
collisions in determining the rain initiation time.

4. Delaying rain by hygroscopic over-seeding

That the rain time is a non-monotonic function of the
concentration of droplets may provide a partial explana-
tion for the conﬂicting observations of the eﬀect of hy-
groscopic seeding. By seeding clouds with hygroscopic
aerosol particles one can vary the number of cloud con-
densation nuclei and thus the number of small droplets

served that such seeding in some cases suppresses pre-
cipitation (see e.g. Rosenfeld et al 2001), while in other
cases enhances and accelerates it (Cotton and Pielke,

−1.

The role of sling eﬀect is not signiﬁcant at those levels
of turbulence: for the upper curve it gives the contri-
bution of order of 10% between 25 and 35 µm.

The system (6,7) is our mean-ﬁeld model where the
only memory of spatial inhomogeneities are the fallout
term and the renormalization of the collision kernel K.
As we show here, this model gives the rain initiation
times with reasonable quantitative values and proper
qualitative behavior upon the change of parameters.
Let us discuss ﬁrst how t∗ depends on n. Here, the
most important feature is the existence of the mini-
mum in the function t∗(n). That can be explained by
the competition between condensation and collisions.
Increasing n one decreases a∗ (the crossover size for
which condensation time is comparable to the time of
collisional growth) and thus decreases the time needed
for droplet growth. This works until a∗ is getting com-
parable to ac ≃ (M/nρ0)1/3.
Indeed, when droplets
grow comparable to ac vapor depletion slows and then
stops condensation. If one takes the initial concentra-
tion even larger so that ac < a∗ then vapor depletion
stops condensation earlier and collisions are slower for
droplets of the smaller size ac so that the overall time
of droplet growth is getting larger. The concentration
n∗ that corresponds to the minimal time can be found
from the (implicit) relation ac ≃ a∗ which corresponds
to

(M/n∗ρ0)

−1/3K

(M/n∗ρ0)1/3)
i
h

≃ κs

(8)

That tells that n∗ ∝ M and if K ∝ aα then
n∗ ∝ s3/(1−α). One can argue that for small concen-
trations (generally for maritime clouds), n < n∗, times
of condensation and collision stages are comparable.
Therefore, t∗ is a function of the product M s. For a
homogeneous kernel, t∗ ∝ n−2/(2+α)(M s)−α/(2+α). For

It is often desirable to postpone rain, for instance, to
bring precipitation inland from the sea. The fact that
t∗ grows when n > n∗ suggests the idea of over-seeding
to delay rain. This is considered to be unpractical: “It
would be necessary to treat all portions of a target cloud
because, once precipitation appeared anywhere in it,
the raindrops . . . would be circulated throughout the
cloud . . . by turbulence” (Dennis, 1980). We think that
this conclusion ignores another, positive, aspect of cloud
turbulence namely the mixing and homogenization of
partially seeded cloud during the condensation stage.
Let us describe brieﬂy how it works for two cases.

0 = L2

Consider ﬁrst seeding a part of the cloud comparable
to its size Lc. Note that we do not consider here adding
ultra-giant nuclei, we assume seeded CCN to be com-
parable in size to those naturally present. According
to the Richardson law, the squared distance between
two ﬂuid parcels grows as ǫt3 so that the rms diﬀerence
of vapor concentrations between seeded and unseeded
parts decreases as t−9/4 when t3 > t3
c/ǫ (ǫ is
the energy dissipation rate in turbulence). To see how
diﬀerent rates of condensation interplay with turbulent
mixing we generalize the mean-ﬁeld system (6,7) de-
scribing seeded and unseeded parts by their respective
n1, n2 and x1 = s1M1, x2 = s2M2 and link them by
adding the term that models the decay of the diﬀer-
ence: dxi/dt = . . . − (xi − xj)t(t + t0)−2(9/4). As a
crude model, we assume two parts to evolve separately
until t = 2t0, then we treat the cloud as well-mixed and
allow for the collisions between droplets from diﬀerent
parts. That actually underestimates the eﬀect of seed-
ing and can be considered as giving the lower bound
for the time before rain. The results of simulations are

shown in Fig. 10 for t0 = 180 s, L = 2 km and λ = 20
s−1.
It is seen from Fig. 10A that the water content
W changes similarly to what was shown in Figs. 2.3
and the rain initiation time is again determined by the
maximum of d2W/dt2. The respective times are shown
against n0 = (n1 +n2)/2 by boxes in Fig. 10B. The time
increase is less than for homogeneous seeding but is still
substantial. The fraction of the cloud still unmixed af-
ter the time t decreases by the Poisson law exp(−t/t0).
Taking n1 = 100 cm−3 one sees that for a time delay of
10 min one needs to seed by n2 ≃ 3000 cm−3.

Second, consider seeding by N particles a small part
of the cloud which (unseeded) had some n0 and would
rain after t∗. After time t∗ the seeds spread into the
∗)1/2 with the concentration inside the
area of size (ǫt3
∗)−3/2 (for strat-
mixed region decaying as n(t∗) = N (ǫt3
iform clouds one gets N (ǫt3)−1). To have an eﬀect of
seeding, one needs n(t∗) > n0 which requires N > 1015
for n0 = 50 cm−3, t∗ = 10 min and ǫ = 10 cm2s−1.
With sub-micron particles weighing 10−11 g that would
mean hundreds of kilograms which is still practical.

5. Summary

We believe that our main result is a simple mean-ﬁeld
model (6,7) which demonstrates non-monotonic depen-
dence of the rain initiation time on CCN concentration.
As the CCN concentration increases, the rain initia-
tion time ﬁrst decreases and then grows as shown in
Figs. 9,10. The simple modiﬁcation of this model for
an inhomogeneous case described in Sect. 4 shows that
one can increase the rain initiation time even for a cloud
partially seeded by hygroscopic aerosols.

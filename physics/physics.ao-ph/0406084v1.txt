Abstract

In this paper we focus on the microwave bistatic scattering process, with the aim of deriving an
expression for the interferometric complex ﬁeld auto-correlation function from a static platform.
We start from the Fresnel integral and derive the auto-correlation function in the Fraunhofer and
Modiﬁed Fraunhofer regime. The autocorrelation function at short times can be expressed as a
Gaussian with a direction dependent time scale. The directional modulation is a function of the
angle between the scattering direction and the wave direction. The obtained relation can be used
for directional sea state estimation using one or more GNSS-R coastal receivers.

Keywords: GNSS-R, GPS, Galileo, sea state, Interferometric Complex Field, ICF.

Introduction

The use of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals reﬂected by the sea surface as
a remote sensing tool has generated considerable attention for over a decade. Among several ap-
plications, two classes have rapidly emerged in the community: sea-surface altimetry, which aims
at retrieving the mean sea level like classical radar altimeters do, and sea-surface scatterometry
or “speculometry” (a better term, as the GNSS-R return is dominated by quasi-specular scatter-
ing) for the determination of sea roughness and near surface wind. This paper addresses a new
application: sea state monitoring from low altitude, static platforms.

The Oceanpal project at Starlab focuses on the development of technologies for operational
in-situ or low-altitude water surface monitoring using GNSS-R. Oceanpal† is a “down-to-Earth”
offspring of technology developed within several ESA/ESTEC projects targeted on the exploita-
tion of GNSS Reﬂections from space, following the proposal of Mart´ın-Neira in 1993 [6]. This in-
strument is to provide low cost/low maintenance sea state and altimetry measurements for coastal
applications with the inherent precision of GNSS technology. Altimetric applications from the
ground and from space have already been demonstrated in other campaigns [3, 7], as well as
airborne sea-state applications [5].

The present paper was motivated by a recent Oceanpal experiment conducted by Starlab in
collaboration with the Barcelona Port Authority for the demonstration of GNSS-R sea state moni-
toring from low altitude, static platforms [9]. The HOPE 2 (Harbor Oceanpal Experiment) experi-
mental campaign gathered GNSS-R data from a ground platform in a range of sea-state conditions.
It was carried out during December 2003 at the Meteorological station of Porta Coeli belonging
to the Barcelona Port Authority, located on the port breakers. Two antennas were deployed at ap-
proximately 25 meters over the open sea surface to gather GPS-L1 signals. As usual in GNSS-R,
one antenna was zenith-looking (Right Hand Circularly Polarized) to get the direct signal, and the
other was oriented towards the open sea surface with the complementary polarization (Left Hand
Circularly Polarization) to get the reﬂected signals. The antennas were connected to the instru-
ment Front End, which then generated a digital bit-stream of unprocessed GPS data at IF. The IF
data were recorded at a sample frequency of
16 MHz, processed on board to produce complex
waveforms, and transferred to the instrument mass storage unit.

∼

Our analysis for sea state begins with the interferometric complex ﬁeld (ICF), deﬁned at time
t by FI (t) = FR(t)/FD(t), where FD and FR are the complex values at the amplitude peaks of
the direct and reﬂected complex waveforms, respectively. The direct signal is thus used as a ref-
erence to remove features unrelated to ocean motion, such as any residual Doppler, the navigation
bit phase offset, or direct signal power variability. From a static platform, the ICF time history
contains very valuable information on the sea state.

The goal of the present analysis is to relate dynamics of the ICF to sea-surface geophysical
parameters. Given the static character of the experiment and the very small scattering area—
we recall the instrument was deployed at low altitude (
25 m) in this experiment—sea-surface
roughness parameters such as the Directional Mean Square Slope (DMSS) are not foreseen to
be quantiﬁable through the estimation of the width and orientation of the scattering area (Delay-
Doppler mapping) as they were in [5]—especially given the coarse nature of the C/A code which
is available today.

In this note we formulate an expression for the ICF autocorrelation function in the Fraunhofer

and modiﬁed Fraunhofer approximations starting from the Fresnel integral for the scattered ﬁeld
(scalar physical optics).

2. Fresnel integral

We start our derivation from the Fresnel integral approximation for the scattered ﬁeld and
ignore for the time being curvature related polarization effects (see p. 380, Eq. 17 in [2]). The
context is that of GPS reﬂections in a static receiver scenario. Although the GPS signal is not
monochromatic, it can be thus approximated, since the code modulation (here represented by a[t])
adds relatively small bandwidth to the signal (ωm << ω). This is an important consideration,
since it means that there is no need to work with wave-packets.

We start from a signal of the form a[t] exp[iωt] exp[inπ], as emitted by the satellite (the last
term is the navigation bit, and we ignore Doppler and emission gain factors). The direct electric
ﬁeld at the surface is given by (refer to Figure 1)

Equation 2.2 just states that each point in the surface acts like a local mirror source of the
incoming ﬁeld, incorporating the appropriate delay: the resulting ﬁeld is the superposition of all
those ﬁelds modulated by the antenna gain. Correlation of this signal with a replica of the “clean”
direct signal will further modulate the support of this superposition, as we now discuss.

The GNSS-R receiver measures the (real part) of the electric ﬁeld (including the carrier)
through the coupling of the electric ﬁeld to the antenna, which induces currents and voltage vari-
ations. This voltage is a direct measure of the electric ﬁeld (polarization issues aside), up to a
multiplicative constant, which we ignore here—and noise. GNSS signal processing (the corre-
lation process) allows for removal of carrier and code modulation and thus the recovery of the
electric ﬁeld spatial and slow temporal amplitude and phase variation as ﬁltered by the WAF (as
is nicely described in [10]). This is what Equation 2.3 represents.

We assume here that ~q

Now, many approximations have been used so far. The important thing to retain is that the
autocorrelation function is suppressed by the SWH dependent term and that the coherence function
can be written in the form,

That is, suppressed by a SWH term, and with a temporal behavior modulated by the relationship
of two directions: the surface autocorrelation direction, and the scattering axis. We can again look
at short times and write and updated version of the autocorrelation function

Since ~q⊥ = 0 in the near specular Fraunhofer scenario, we do not have a directional modiﬁcation.
This is the expression used in [9].

Directional sensitivity is present here only in the case the instrument is pointing away from the
specular direction. In the specular scenario (e.g., the antenna is pointed to the geometric specular
point, or the antenna gain is very low), directional sensitivity of the ICF coherence time will begin
to appear only in the Modiﬁed Fraunhofer approximation and through the inclusion of a surface
current term in the autocorrelation function, as we discuss next.

4. Modiﬁed Fraunhofer

A moment’s thought will show that the only way that a modulating term associated to the
scattering axis can appear is through the higher order terms in the Fresnel integral—the Fraunhofer
limit is not sufﬁcient. The modiﬁed Fraunhofer provides us with the reference direction ~r′
⊥ (the
scattering axis).

Now we can see that the combination of the Modiﬁed Fraunhofer expression for the ﬁeld, and the
new autocorrelation function bring two new directions to play: the scattering axis, and the wave
direction. To ﬁrst order, and allowing for empirical adjustment to our approximations, the new
expected result will be

Equation 4.26 should provide the basis to determine direction in the waves (Oceanpal SWH
Algorithm 2). Using data from visible satellites at any given time (with different elevations and
azimuths) the optimal wave direction φu and ocean “z-velocity” Zv = SWH/τz parameters can be

ship between τz and the SWH: τz = as + bs ∗
0.03 s). This relation turns out to be rather independent of wave age. Using it, we can now rewrite
Equation 4.28 as

5. Conclusion

In this note we have derived an expression which can be used for the deﬁnition of a semi-
empirical algorithms for low altitude, static GNSS-R sea state and wave direction (as in [9]).
The expression relates the interferometric ﬁeld autocorrelation function coherence time with sea
state parameters. Although directional sensitivity is already present in the Fraunhofer regime
analysis with a moderate gain antenna factor pointing away from the specular, surface current
sensitivity appears only in the Modiﬁed Fraunhofer regime. The derived expression is sensitive
to the wave direction relative to the scattering direction and to the ocean “z-velocity”, the ratio
of SWH to surface coherence time, and can be used for coastal sea state monitoring using one or
more receivers.

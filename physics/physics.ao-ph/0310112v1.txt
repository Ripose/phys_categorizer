Abstract

We consider a simpliﬁed model of typhoon based on the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes barotropic
equations. Exact solutions with linear proﬁle of velocity to these equations are found. We de-
scribe the qualitative behaviour of the vortex and possible trajectories of the typhoon eye.

1 Preliminaries

The typhoon (or tropical hurricane) is a vortex of middle-scale in the atmosphere.
It is a
rather stable structure, existing sometimes within more then a week. Its trajectory can be
very complicated, it can suddenly change the direction, make loops, the motion can stop
for several days. The speed of wind in the vortex region may amount to 150 m/sec. The
huge experimental information, including the archive of hurricanes paths can be found on
[1]. Because of enormous destructive force, the prediction of typhoon’s
the following sites:
trajectory is a very important problem. The physics of typhoon is complicated [2], thus for
the suﬃcient description of the phenomenon they use systems of PDE, that can be solved only
numerically.

However, there are attempts to explain qualitative properties of of typhoon’s behaviour by
means of the simpliﬁed models. It is necessary to mention a serie of papers [3, 4, 5], and also [6].
Our approach is on this way. We use very simpliﬁed model, namely, two-dimensional model
based on the barotropic Navier-Stokes equations taking into account the Earth’s rotation.
It can be obtained from the primitive system of atmosphere dynamics after averaging over
high using geostrophic approximation [7],[8]. We do not consider conditions of the vortex
generation, we suppose that it is formed and will exist within some time. Our aim is to
predict the displacement of the central domain of the vortex. We seek the exact solution of
the system of some special form. In fact, this signiﬁes that we linearize the solution near the
origin of the moving coordinate system.

Our result correlates with [3], where was used a particular case of the same model, namely,
the inviscid one with the heat ratio γ = 2 (the ”shallow water” model).
It is interesting
that in [3] the typhoon eye is considered as a point-singularity (week singularity of square

1

root type upon the Maslov hypothesis [9]). The propagation of this singularity are deﬁned
with the necessity by an inﬁnite chain of ordinary diﬀerential equations. The important
problem is to ﬁnd the method of closing the chain. Authors use the method proposed in [10].
Namely, according to this method one can approximate the functions, deﬁning the solution
and setting the singularity, by means of several ﬁrst terms of the Taylor series near the origin
of the coordinate system connected with the typhoon eye. The principal point is that all
this function are approximating by terms of same order. After this procedure the system
can be solved explicitly for the ﬁrst approximation (however, the predicted trajectory is not
realistic), and only numerically for a second approximation. In the last case, by comparing
the numerical data with the trajectory of the real typhoon, it was observed their quite good
qualitative coincidence.

The idea of consideration a typhoon as ”a singularity of square root type” is criticized by
meteorologists. In [6] it is noticed, that a deviation of pressure from norm on 8-17% in the
center of typhoon is more likely an occasion for linearization, not for ” algebraic singularity of
root type”. Also in [6] it is argued that modeling a typhoon we cannot consider the horizontal
scale greater, then vertical, however, this assumption is necessary for the derivation of the
”shallow water” equations. Stress that our model becomes bidimentional only after procedure
of averaging over high. As a result we get the model where the vertical displacement of air in
the center of typhoon is taken into account (by means of the function β, see below).

What about [6], the non stationary axially symmetric model of typhoon eye taken into
account the vertical transfer is considered there. However, only the three-dimensional veloc-
ity takes part in the model, while the changing of density and the presence of the Coriolis
parameter are not taken into account (whereas, they are very essential factors, as we shall see
below). Nevertheless, the model gives a possibility to ﬁnd decaying and blowing up solutions,
that our model predicts as well.

The system of ODE that we obtain in this work from other assumptions on the properties
of solution near the typhoon eye, is the same as in [3], if we use ﬁrst approximation for velocity
and second approximation for the density. In the case we obtain the closed system for ﬁnding
the exact (not only approximate!) solution. Our system is more less complicated that the
system of [3] for second approximation, in particular cases it can be solved explicitly, however
the possible trajectories are suﬃciently realistic. (Note that from the numerical results of [3]one
can conclude that the trajectory depends little on the quadratic terms in the development of
velocity, whereas their presence complicates the system signiﬁcantly.) Moreover, by means of
our results we can explain in a sort the sudden changing of the trajectory direction.

We realize that by means of ”toy” models we cannot describe the complicated typhoon

behaviour, however, it is interesting that some important qualitative features can be found.

2 Simpliﬁed model of the typhoon dynamics

Let x be a point on the Earth surface, t be a time, ϕ0 be a latitude of some ﬁxed point x0,
ω = (0, 0, ω3)T be the angular velocity of the Earth rotation. As the plane approximation

2

near x0, we have the following system ([11],[7]) for the velocity vector U(t, x) and the density
̺(t, x) > 0:

∂tU + (U · ∇)U + 2ω0T U + ̺∇p = µ∆U + λ∇(∇ · U),
∂t̺ + ∇ · (̺U) = − ˜β(x),

with

ω0 = ω3 sin ϕ0,

where z is a vertical coordinate, the function b(x, z) models the ﬂow-out of mass from the
typhoon center, ¯̺ is the density averaged all over the atmosphere.

Introduce a new variable π = ̺γ−1. Note that if γ = 2, then π = ̺. For new variables π, U

we have the system

∂tU + (U · ∇)U + 2ω0T U + p0∇π = µ∆U + λ∇(∇ · U),

∂tπ + ∇π · U + (γ − 1)∇U = −β(x),

where β(x) = (γ − 1)π

2−γ
γ−1 β(x).

Following [3], we change the coordinate system, so that the origin of the new system will
be the typhoon eye. Now U = u + V, where V(t) = (V1(t), V2(t)) is a speed of the eye
propagation. Thus, we obtain the new system

∂tu + (u · ∇)u + ˙V + lT (u + V) + p0∇π = µ∆u + λ∇(∇ · u),

∂tπ + ∇π · u + (γ − 1)π∇u = −β(x),

(2.1)

here we denote 2ω0 sin φ0 by l, it is supposed that β(0) = β0 > 0,

β(x)dx = 0.

Note that in [3] the particular case of (2.1–2.2) is considered, namely, there γ = 2, λ =

µ = 0.

Given the vector V, the trajectory can be found by integration of the system

˙x1(t) = V1(t),

˙x2(t) = V2(t).

3 Solution with linear proﬁle of velocity

Suppose the typhoon has radially-symmetric structure, therefore the velocity vector near the
origin has the form

u(t, x) = a(t)r + b(t)r⊥,

where

r = (x1, x2)T , r⊥ = (x2, −x1)T .

(3.1)

Our assumption is in a good compliance with experimental data [12]. Note that it is possible
to construct the solution all over the plane [13],[14] such that conservation laws take place,
however it is not realistic for our problem, as it requires the vanishing of density at inﬁnity.
Note that the velocity with linear proﬁle does not feel the viscosity term, therefore our result
would be the same in the inviscid model (µ = λ = 0).

Further, we seek the density near the origin in the form

̺ = π

γ−1 ,

π(t, x) = A(t)x2

1 + B(t)x1x2 + C(t)x2

2 + M(t)x1 + N(t)x2 + K(t).

(3.2)

From the physical sense K(t) > 0. Substitute (3.1), (3.2) in (2.1), (2.2) and equal the coef-
ﬁcients at the same degrees. Firstly, we obtain that A(t) = C(t), B(t) = 0. Because in the
center of typhoon there is a domain of lower pressure, it is natural to consider A(t) > 0.

We suppose that β(x) = β0 + β1(x2

1 + x2

2), where β0, β1 are constants, β0 > 0.

The functions a(t), b(t), A(t), M(t), N(t), K(t), V1(t), V2(t) satisfy the following system of

ODE:

˙A + 2γaA = −β1,
˙a + a2 − b2 + lb + 2p0A = 0,
˙b + 2ab − la = 0,
˙K + 2(γ − 1)aK = −β0,
˙M + (2γ − 1)aM − bN = 0,
˙N + (2γ − 1)aN + bM = 0,
˙V1 − lV2 + p0M = 0,
˙V2 + lV1 + p0N = 0.

Is is known that typhoons in the phase of maturity behave as a stable vortex, moving during
a rather long time with a divergency oscilating about zero and an almost constant vorticity.
Thus, we can see that only in the case γ < 2 there is a possibility of such equilibrium (the
center on the phase plane, see Section 3.1).

Further, it is natural to relate the equilibrium (A = 0, a =

), to a decaying typhoon. It

follows from (3.11) that b →

under this process. However, if C1 = 0 (b(0) =

), then, on

the contrary, there is a possibility of unrestricted rise of A(t) and |a(t)| (see also Section 3.1)

ﬁrst approximation there are the only possibility A = 0.

3.3 Why the typhoons do not exist in low and high latitudes?

It is well known that typhoons never appear lower then 5o and higher then 30o of latitude,
however the mature vortex sometime can come to 45o. Let us show that this fact one can
explain by means of our simple model, taking into account only the relationship between the
relative vorticity and the Coriolis parameter.

It seems naive to explain the phenomenon without temperature factors, convection and
global circulation, however in [15] among factors, putting the typhoon development ahead,
foremost ones are initial relative vorticity and Coriolis parameter. Stress once more that we
try describe the situation only qualitatively, and we study conditions of existence of intense
vortex, not of its appearance.

Recall that the stable equilibrium (the center) can exist in our model only if γ < 2 and if

the function f (A) =

γ − 2p0A takes a negative value at some A > 0. Let us consider

this function as a function of parameter l, other parameter being ﬁxed. Namely,

˜f (l) =

For the sake of simplicity we consider A(t) ∼ A(0), therefore

˜f (l) ∼

+ b0l + b2

0 − 2p0A(0).

l2
2

We see that ˜f (l) can be negative only if b2
that is the vorticity is suﬃciently intense. Then ˜f (l) < 0 only if

0 < 4p0A(0), moreover, we suppose that b2

0 > 2p0A(0),

l ∈ (l−, l+), 0 < l− < l+, l± = b ±

4p0A(0) − b2
0.

Thus, we ﬁnd the restriction for the Coriolis parameter, necessary for the existence of stable
equilibrium (A = A+ > 0, a = 0) on the phase plane of system (3.3), (3.12).

4 Possible trajectories

Let us analyze trajectories of a stable typhoon, that is we suppose that A = A+, where ¯A is

the greatest root of (3.16), a = 0, b = b0 =

Let us observe once more the situations presented on the Figures. For all Figures x1(0) =

have time to pass throughout the trajectory. Moreover, because the eye is not exactly in the
equilibrium point, the trajectory oscillates near the trajectory presented in the picture.

Figures 2 and 3. A slowly rotating typhoon. Here l = 8 · 10−5 sec−1, b0 = l/100,
M(0) = 2 · 10−14 m/sec2, N(0) = 0, V1(0) = V2(0) = 0, (Fig.2) V1(0) = −10 m/sec, V2(0) = 0
(Fig.3).

Figure 4. Resonance case. Here l = b0 = 10−5 sec−1, M(0) = 10−13 m/sec2, N(0) =

0, V1(0) = −10 m/sec, V2(0) = 0.

Figures 5 and 6. A ”making time” typhoon. The examples of exotic trajectories are

presented. Here l = 2 · 10−5 sec−1, b0 = −

, M(0) = 10−13 m/sec2, N(0) = 0, V1(0) = V2(0) =

l

0 (Fig.5), V1(0) = 1m/sec, V2(0) = 0 (Fig.6).

At last it is possible that the thypoon passes to other equilibrium. It is known that that it
can decay and regenerate several times. However it signiﬁes that the trajectory of its motion
modiﬁes according to a new regime. Thus, as a rough approximation, the trajectory will be
glued from several standard parts.

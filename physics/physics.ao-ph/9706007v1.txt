The El Ni˜no Stochastic Oscillator

Submitted to Journal of Climate, April 1997

abstract

Anomalies during an El Ni˜no are dominated by a single, irregularly oscillating,
mode. Equatorial dynamics has been linked to delayed-oscillator models of this
mode. Usually, the El Ni˜no mode is regarded as an unstable mode of the coupled
atmosphere system and the irregularity is attributed to noise and possibly chaos.

Here a variation on the delayed oscillator is explored. In this stochastic-oscillator

view, El Ni˜no is a stable mode excited by noise.

It is shown that the autocorrelation function of the observed NINO3.4 index is

that of a stochastic oscillator, within the measurement uncertainty.

Decadal variations as would occur in a stochastic oscillator are shown to be
comparable to those observed, only the increase in the long-term mean around 1980
is rather large.

The observed dependence of the seasonal cycle on the variance and the correla-
tion is so large that it can not be attributed to the natural variability of a stationary
stochastic oscillator. So the El Ni˜no stochastic-oscillator parameters must depend
on the season.

A forecast model based on the stochastic oscillator with a variance that depends
on the season has a skill that approaches that of more comprehensive statistical
models: over the period 1982-1993, the anomaly correlation is 0.65 for two-season
lead forecasts.

1 Introduction

ENSO indices are highly correlated. The correlation between the Southern Oscillation
and El Ni˜no has given even ENSO its name.

Another well-known example is the correlation between sea surface height (SSH) and
sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the Eastern Paciﬁc. The correlation of the
NCEP analyzed SSH anomaly (Ming Ji, private communication) and the observed SST
anomaly in the NINO3 region exceeds 0.85 for the period 1980–1995. The same applies
for the correlation between the observed SSH anomaly at Santa Cruz (as made available
by the University of Hawaii Sea Level Center) and observed NINO3 SST anomalies over

the period 1978–1995. In general, it seems that ENSO related anomalies are dominated
by one single mode.

It is widely accepted that the delayed-oscillator mechanism of Suarez and Schopf
(1987) and Battisti and Hirst (1989) explains this mode, or at least the predictable part
of the interannual oscillations (Kleeman 1993). The main idea of the delayed oscillator is
as follows (Cane 1992). A positive SST anomaly in East Paciﬁc gives rise to an eastward
wind anomaly around the equator in a region centered at about 170◦W. This wind anomaly
not only generates an eastward propagating Kelvin wave that deepens the thermocline and
increases the SST anomaly in the Eastern Paciﬁc, but also generates westward propagating
Rossby waves. These reﬂect at the Western boundary, and come back as a delayed Kelvin
wave that decreases the SST anomaly in the Eastern Paciﬁc. Eventually the combination
of the positive direct and negative delayed feedback leads to an oscillation with a period
of O(3 – 4)year, which is an order of magnitude larger than the delay time.

Given this picture, the following questions should be considered: how does a pertur-

bation grow initially, why is it bounded and why are the oscillations irregular.

Usually, see e.g. Suarez and Schopf (1987) and Battisti and Hirst (1989), it is assumed
that the mode simply grows because it is unstable, and that it is bounded because of non-
linear eﬀects. The irregularity could arise from non-linearity in the ENSO dynamics as in
the original Zebiak-Cane (1987) model, from interaction between the ENSO dynamics and
the annual cycle (Jin et al. 1994, Tziperman et al. 1994), or from “noise” from atmospheric
variability not directly related to ENSO. In the latter case, Battisti and Hirst (1989) and
Philander (1990) argue that part of the year the basic state could be stable (Hirst 1986)
and the development of anomalies susceptible to external perturbations. Mantua and
Battisti (1995) list intraseasonal oscillations and the south Asian monsoon as plausible
sources for atmospheric noise in the western Paciﬁc. Kleeman and Moore (1997) analyze
how atmospheric noise limits the predictability of an intermediate El Ni˜no model.

Consider now the autocorrelation function of the NINO3 or the NINO3.4 index1. The
autocorrelation function of the NINO3.4 index over the period 1951–1995 is shown in
Fig. 1. It is a fairly smooth function of the delay time and looks like a decaying cosine
function. This suggests an alternative mechanism to explain the size and irregularity of
ENSO.

In this explanation, the ENSO mode is stable, and noise both excites this mode and

makes it irregular.

The simplest model which exhibits such behaviour, that of a stochastic oscillator, has
an autocorrelation function that is a decaying cosine, just like observed. So I propose
a stochastic-oscillator mechanism to describe ENSO. The idea is not new. Jin (1997)
discusses in some detail a stochastic oscillator as one possible mechanism to excite his
coupled recharge oscillator ENSO model. New in the present paper is that the stochas-
tic oscillator is tested as a forecast model, and that the consequences of the stochastic
oscillator mechanism for decadal variability are investigated.

Hasselmann (1976) introduced the concept of stochastic forcing as a source of variabil-
ity in climate modelling. Most applications have dealt with the case of a red variability
spectrum caused by a white noise forcing. Lau (1985) proposed that ENSO ﬂuctua-
tions are the result of stochastic forcing inducing transitions between multiple equilibrium
states. The idea of a stochastic oscillator is a very natural one too. It has been applied
to model variability of the thermohaline circulation (Griﬃes and Tziperman 1995) and
to discuss decadal variability (Griﬃes and Bryan 1997; M¨unnich et al. 1997). A decadal
delayed oscillator model for exchanges between the tropics and the extratropics has been
proposed by Gu and Philander (1997). Chang, Ji and Li (1997) discuss stochastically
excited oscillatory modes in the context of decadal variability in the Tropical Atlantic
and Jin (1997) for ENSO.

Above, the delayed-oscillator picture and the observed NINO3.4 index autocorrelation
suggested to look at a stochastic oscillator. Another motivation stems from the success of
hybrid coupled models (Balmaseda et al. 1994, Latif 1987, Barnett et al. 1993), which have
stable coupled modes. Fl¨ugel and Chang (1996) and Eckert and Latif (1997) studied the
impact of an extra stochasting forcing in a HCM. The stochastic oscillator can be viewed
as a representation of the main coupled mode of such a HCM with noise. Alternatively,
one can arrive at the stochastic oscillator if one uses statistical techniques for signal
processing, like ﬁtting autoregressive-moving average (ARMA) models to timeseries, or
making a POP or CCA analysis of observed ﬁelds. Indeed, Penland and Sardeshmukh
(1995), who made an inverse modeling analysis of SST anomalies, have put forward the
notion that the El Ni˜no system is stable and driven by white noise, although they do not
propose a system of the simple stochastic-oscillator type.

In section 2 the stochastic oscillator is formulated, and its autocorrelation function is

compared with the observed autocorrelation of the NINO3.4 index.

Simply by chance, considering a series of periods of say ﬁfteen years, there will be ﬂuc-
tuations in properties like mean, variance and apperent autocorrelation parameters that
1 The NINO3 index is the mean SST anomaly of the region 5◦S–5◦N, 150◦W–90◦W, and the NINO3.4

index of the region 5◦S–5◦N, 170◦W–120◦W.

might account for the observed ﬂuctuations in these parameters. This will be discussed
in section 3.

In section 4 the inﬂuence of the seasonal cycle is discussed. A simple modiﬁcation of
the stationary stochastic oscillator which allows for a seasonal dependence of the variance
is introduced.

In section 5 forecasts made with the stochastic oscillator are evaluated. The simple
model, based on the timeseries of a single variable, has a forecast skill that is comparable
to that of some models actually used for ENSO predictions.

Finally, section 6 contains a discussion and the conclusion. Some technical aspects of

the stochastical oscillator are discussed in Appendix A.

2 The stochastic oscillator model

The observed autocorrelation of the NINO3.4 index over the period 1951-1995 was shown
in Fig. 1, toghether with the autocorrelations over the three 15-year long subperiods. The
NINO indices have been made available by the U.S. National Centers for Environmen-
tal Prediction (NCEP), and are the result of the processing of satellite, ship and buoy
observations (Reynolds and Smith 1994).

The autocorrelation has a rather regular shape, like a damped oscillation. The diﬀer-
ences between the three ﬁfteen year periods shown are considerable, though. This suggests
that random ﬂuctuations are important, and that it is probably not meaningful to extract
more than two or three parameters above the noise from a ﬁt to this autocorrelation.

As mentioned in the Introduction, the delayed-oscillator model is about the simplest
system ENSO can be reduced to. At the level of simpliﬁcation of the delayed-oscillator,
one can just as well take a regular oscillator as a model of the dynamics of the coupled
system. The interpretation of the delayed-oscillator is of course more direct. To ﬁt
the observed autocorrelation, some source of irregularity has to be introduced. One of
the simplest ways to accomplish this is just adding noise. The resulting system is the
stochastic oscillator.

The basic equations of the discrete stochastic oscillator can be written as follows:

Here x and y are the variables of the two degrees of freedom of the oscillator, a and b are
constants and ξ and η are noise terms, which may be correlated. It is assumed that noise
between diﬀerent timesteps is not correlated. The constants a and b can be related to a
oscillation period T = 2πω−1 and a decay time scale D = γ−1 as follows:

where ∆t is the timestep.

Throughout this paper, the value of the timestep is ∆t= 1 month.

xi+1 = axi − byi + ξi
yi+1 = bxi + ayi + ηi

Fig. 2. The autocorrelation of the observed NINO3.4 index over the period 1951–1995 (solid

line) compared to that of a stochastic-oscillator ﬁt (dashed line).

The deterministic part of the stochastic oscillator should be stable, i.e. a2 + b2 < 1,
otherwise there would be no bound to the amplitude of the oscillations. If the oscillator
is stable, then the variance of x is proportional to the noise variance, see (A6).

The autocorrelation function of x that corresponds to (1) is

ρk = e−kγ∆t cos(kω∆t + α)/ cos α ,
(3)
with the phase shift α a function of both the timescales T = 2πω−1 and D = γ−1 and the
noise variances, see Appendix A.

Next the identiﬁcation of x with an El Ni˜no SST index is made. The variable y stands
for another, independent index. One could think of y as a diagnosed El Ni˜no tendency. It
will remain unidentiﬁed here. Jin (1997) identiﬁes equatorial zonal-mean heat-content as
the second important ENSO variable. However, his stochastic oscillator equations, which
are very much the same as (1), are formulated in terms of the East Paciﬁc temperature
anomaly and the West Paciﬁc thermocline anomaly.

If one considers x only, (1) is equivalent to an ARMA(2,1) process, as shown in Ap-

pendix A,

xi+1 = 2axi − (a2 + b2)xi−1 + ǫi − kǫi−1 .

(4)

Note that two noise parameters enter (4): the variance of ǫ and k (−1 ≤ k ≤ 1).

In Fig. 2 the autocorrelation of the observed NINO3.4 index for the period 1951–1995
is compared to that of a stochastic-oscillator ﬁt. The parameters and error estimates were
obtained from a maximum-likelihood procedure. Their values are T = 47 ± 6 months,
D = 18 ± 6 months, and k = 0.86 ± 0.05. The values of T , D, and k correspond to a value
of α = −2◦ ± 7◦ in (3). The errors are highly correlated. The variance of the driving
noise is hǫǫi = (0.24K)2, to be compared to the rms magnitude of the signal, which is
0.7K. The correspondence is good, in view of the diﬀerences between the observed curves
in Fig. 1. A better assesment of the correspondence will be made in section 3.

a stochastic oscillator. The period, decay time scale and noise parameters of the stochastic
oscillator were determined from a ﬁt to the observed data.

In Fig. 3, a typical Monte Carlo time series generated with the same mean parameters

and noise is compared to a part of the observed NINO3.4 timeseries.

In Fig. 4, the residues, i.e. the estimates for ǫi in (4), are shown for the ﬁt to the
observed timeseries over the period 1950–1995. The r.m.s. of the autocorrelation of the
residues for the ﬁrst 24 months is 0.05 and the largest value is 0.10, values that are
compatible with a white noise process for a timeseries of this length.

A similar ﬁt can be made to the observed NINO3 time series for the period 1951–1995.
A good ﬁt is found for T = 46 ± 6 months, D = 17 ± 5 months, and k = 0.90 ± 0.04 (α =
10◦±5◦). The variance of the driving noise is (0.34K)2, the variance of the signal (0.85K)2.
The diﬀerence in time scales between the NINO3 and NINO3.4 cases is insigniﬁcant, just
as one expects if the NINO3 and NINO3.4 indices are manifestations of the same mode
but with diﬀerent noise.

How do the above time scales ﬁt in the delayed-oscillator equation

of Suarez and Schopf (1988) and Battisti and Hirst (1989)? The delayed oscillator (5) has
solutions of the form exp(−γt + iωt). For the main mode, one has

dT (t)/dt = cT (t) − bT (t − τ )

(γ + c)2 + ω2 = b2e2γτ
(γ + c) = ω/ tan(ωτ )

(5)

(6)

An essential element of the delayed oscillator is that the parameters c and b are positive.
However, although a positive c means a local instability, this does not exclude a stable
oscillator (Suarez and Schopf 1988, Battisti and Hirst 1989).

Actually, slightly diﬀerent choices of the parameters b, c and τ in the delayed oscillator
(5) can make the diﬀerence between stable and unstable. The choice c = 2yr−1, b = 4yr−1,

6

period 1951-1995.

and a delay time of τ = 0.5yr, as in Battisti and Hirst (1989), leads to a harmonic oscillator
with a period of 3 years and a growth scale of −γ = 1.1yr, which excludes a stochastic
oscillator. Changing this to c = 2.4yr−1, b = 2.8yr−1, and a delay time of τ = 0.3yr, leads
to a period of 4 years and a decay scale of γ = 1.5yr, which is well within the ranges for
the stochastic oscillator found above.

It is still an open question whether in nature the delayed oscillator is stable or unstable,

see Schneider et al. (1995).

3 Decadal variability

Over the years, properties of El Ni˜no appear to have changed from one decade to another.
E.g., the annual NINO3.4 mean over the ﬁfteen year period 1981–1995 is about 0.3K higher
than the annual mean over the period 1951–1980. The variance and the autocorrelation
function (see Fig. 1 ) diﬀer as well. In addition, there are appreciable diﬀerences in forecast
skill. In Table 1, these diﬀerences are summarized. The error estimates for the stochastic-
oscillator parameters correspond to a decrease of 0.5 in log-likelihood with respect to the
maximum-likelihood estimate.

Here the question will be addressed how much of this variability could come from
random ﬂuctuations in the stochastic-oscillator system. A ﬁrst indication that random

observed autocorrelations of the same three 15-year long subperiods as in Fig. 1 (thin lines).

ﬂuctuations are responsible comes from that fact that most of the numbers in Table 1
agree within the error estimates.

To investigate this further, a long Monte Carlo time series was generated for a stochastic-

oscillator process with the same parameters as the ﬁt to the observed NINO3.4 timeseries
for 1951–1995, and a sample of 500 independent 15-year long runs of this run was ana-
lyzed. In the analysis, the mean seasonal cycle of each run was removed, except for the
calculation of the bias.

In this sample, values for the bias of 0.00±0.13 and for standard deviation of 0.68±0.12
were found. So the diﬀerence in bias between 1951-1980 and 1981-1995 represents a two
standard deviation eﬀect. How much the autocorrelation functions of the sample varied
is shown in Fig. 5. For comparison, the observed autocorrelations over the three 15 year
periods of Fig. 1 are shown as well. Generally, they fall within the 68% ranges of Fig.
5. Close inspection reveals that only for lag 1 over the subperiod 1951-1966 the observed
autocorrelation touches the 95% range, perhaps due to larger observational errors during
this period, cf. Fig. 4.

ARMA parameters were ﬁtted to each member of the sample. The variation in the
parameters was large, which is not surprising in view of the fact that a 15 year period
cannot contain the equivalent of many independent estimates of a 4 year period. The
median value and the 68% range were T = 47+17
−11 months and k =
0.90+0.09
−0.13.
For a longer period of 45 years, the variation in a 500 member sample is reduced to

−8 months, D = 21+12

T = 47+8

−5 months, D = 18+7

−5 months and k = 0.87 ± 0.06.

The forecast skill varies accordingly. Using the “correct” parameters to forecast the
index, the lead time at which the skill had dropped to 0.6 was FS = 6 ± 2 months for the

8

sample of 15-year long runs and FS = 6 ± 1 months for the 45-year long runs.

From the above Monte Carlo results follows that the observed decadal variability is
similar to what one can expect if ENSO is a stochastic oscillator driven by short-term
variability, although the observed change in bias from 1951-1980 compared to 1981-195 is
rather large.

4 Seasonal eﬀects

In the stochastic oscillator discussed so far, El Ni˜no episodes evolve completely indepen-
dent from the seasonal cycle. Observations indicate this is not the case.

The variance of December anomalies is about three times as much as the variance of
April anomalies. Perhaps part of the explanation is that the mean thermocline in Decem-
ber is much more shallow than in April, making SST much more sensitive to anomalies of
the thermocline depth (Kleeman 1993) in December than in April. Another part of the
explanation is that the noise is not stationary. Here the seasonal motion of the ITCZ is
likely to play a role (Philander 1990, Tziperman et al. 1997).

Due to chance, there will also be diﬀerences between the variances of the calendar
months in the stochastic-oscillator runs. A series of 500 Monte Carlo runs of 45 years
length was made to examine the size of the diﬀerences. Only in 8 cases the ratio of the
smallest variance to the largest was smaller than 0.5, and it was never smaller than 0.35.
The median value was 0.7. This is to be compared to the observed value, which is as
small as 0.31. This analysis conﬁrms that a stationary stochastic oscillator cannot give a
seasonal dependence of the variances of the anomalies that is as large as observed.

Another seasonal phenomenon in the observations is that the autocorrelation is not
stationary. The correlation between a January anomaly and the anomaly 6 months earlier
is about 0.8, while the correlation between an August anomaly and the anomaly 6 months
before is only about 0.2. In the stochastic oscillator of section 2 the lag-6 correlation is
about 0.5, independent of the season.

A qualitative explanation of the seasonal dependence of the correlation is that when
the anomaly variance is small, the inﬂuence of the noise will be large, keeping all other
things equal (Philander 1990). This means there is a “spring barrier” in predictability,
caused by the months around April, when the anomaly variance is low.

Again, it is examined how large the diﬀerences in correlation are that occur by chance
in stochastic-oscillator runs.
In each of the runs, the largest diﬀerence in correlation
between pairs with diﬀerent starting months but the same lag was determined. In the
ﬁgures reported here, the maximum permitted lag was 6 months. Of 500 45-year long
runs of a stochastic oscillator the median of this diﬀerence was 0.25, 16% had a diﬀerence
larger than 0.35, and no one had a diﬀerence larger than 0.55. For 15-year runs, the
diﬀerences were much larger, in this case the median diﬀerence was as large as 0.45! This
analysis indicates that it is unlikely that the stochastic oscillator produces the observed
seasonal dependence of the correlation, but also that it is quite hard to make a reliable
estimate of the seasonal dependence of the correlation from observations.

9

The above results show that the stationary stochastic oscillator model of section 2 is

incomplete because it lacks seasonal dependence in variance and correlation.

In principle, the extension is clear: make all parameters dependent on the season, and
repeat the analysis to get the best ﬁt to the observed seasonal dependence. This will not
be attempted here. Instead, the following simple trick is used. The analysis of section 2 is
redone on data scaled to unit variance month-by-month. Stochastic-oscillator parameters
from ﬁts to these standarized anomalies are given in Table 2. The values are similar to
those for ﬁts to the full NINO3.4 anomalies in Table 1.

A stochastic oscillator model of the standarized anomalies is equivalent to a seasonal
stochastic oscillator which is obtained by multiplying the r.h.s. of (1) by a factor that
depends on the calendar month, the products of these factors being unity. This makes that
for the NINO3.4 seasonal stochastic oscillator the deterministic part grows in boreal fall
and decays relatively fast in early spring, giving rise to the observed seasonal dependence
of the variance. Also, it implies that the noise is larger if the deterministic part favours
growth, thus neglecting the seasaonal dependence of the correlation.

Although the above modiﬁcation leaves the correlation unchanged and independent of
the season, it is a great improvement of the covariance. In Fig. 6. the observed covariance
as a function of lag and ﬁnal month is compared to that of a stationary stochastic-oscillator
ﬁt and to that of a ﬁt of a stochastic oscillator with seasonal variance. Note that although
their correlations are almost identical and independent of the season, the second and the
third panel look less similar than the ﬁrst and the third.

Actually, the anomaly correlation of the seasonal stochastic-oscillator forecast for the
full (destandarized) anomalies is somewhat larger than the skills of Table 2. This is be-
cause high-variance months are generally better predictable than low-variance months
in terms of anomaly correlation, due the observed seasonal dependence of the correla-
tions. This applies to persistence skill as well: forecasts based on persistent standarized
anomalies have more skill than forecasts based on persistent anomalies.

5 Forecast skill of the stochastic oscillator

The stochastic oscillator model can be used for making El Ni˜no forecasts. This is an inter-
esting test. According to the model, one mode dominates, and predictability is inherently
limited by the noise. Although the representation of the noise process in (4) may be a
oversimpliﬁcation, it is unlikely that this could make a diﬀerence of more than one or two
months in skill. Also using more data, which would give a better determination of x and y
in (1), will give only a limited increase in skill. This means that if the stochastic-oscillator
forecasts would have much less skill than forecasts of more comprehensive models, then
something should be wrong with the concept of the El Ni˜no stochastic oscillator.

Given the time scales γ−1 and 2πω−1, and the phase angle α, one can make a Kalman

ﬁlter based on (1).

The stochastic-oscillator variable x is identiﬁed with the standarized NINO3.4 index.
The observation error in the NINO3.4 index is neglected, because the errors in the obser-
vation are small compared to the noise variance found in section 2 and anyway part of
the error may have been accounted for by the ﬁt. During the assimilation, an estimate
is obtained for the variable y that is not observed, toghether with an estimate of the
uncertainty in y. For the linear system of (1), the uncertainty in y does not depend on
the observed values of x and converges to an asymptotic value in a few years.

with the qij the noise covariances, see Appendix A. In case (q12)2 = q11q22, when in (1)
ηi/ξi is a constant, one has that limi→∞(P ana
22 )i = 0 for the Kalman estimate of the error
variance in y, and the above equations simplify considerably. Suitable starting values for
y and P22 are y0 = (hxyi/hxxi)x0 and (P22)0 = hy2i − hxyi2/hx2i.

Forecasts can be made starting from an analysis of xi and yi and (P22)i. The Kalman
equations give forecasted values for x and y, and also forecasted values for the uncertainties

12

in x and y. An alternative is making an ensemble of forecast runs, using (1) with diﬀerent
noise for each ensemble member. Finally, the forecasted values for x are destandarized to
get the full anomalies.

The Kalman ﬁlter was tried on the NINO3.4 index, because the NINO3.4 index is

more persistent and easier to predict than the NINO3 index.

In a ﬁrst experiment, forecasts over the period 1956–1995 were made with a model
ﬁtted to the same period. Because the model parameters were determined using the
timeseries over the full period, these are not really forecasts in the strict sense that no
future information is used, and the skill is overestimated substantially. In principle, the
same applies to persistence forecasts based on a climatology calculated over the full period
too, but in that case the eﬀect is only marginal.

The skill as measured by the anomaly correlation and the bias of these “a posteriori”
forecasts is shown in Fig. 7. The correlation drops to about 0.6 after 7.5 months. This
amounts to a gain of 2.5 month over simple persistence skill and of 1.5 month over “stan-
darized persistence” skill (not shown). Also shown in Fig. 7 is that the skill was higher
over the subperiod 1982–1993 than over 1956-1995. However, for longer lead times, the
bias over this subperiod is large. This is because for longer lead times, the stochastic-
oscillator forecasts relax to the climatology of the full period instead of to the subperiod
mean.

In another experiment, quasi-operational forecasts were made for the period 1976–
1995. The model parameters (biases, variances, stochastic-oscillator parameters) for each
forecast were determined using only data from 1956 to the starting month of the forecast.
The skill of these quasi-operational forecasts is shown in Fig. 8. Also shown in Fig. 8 is
the skill of the quasi-operational forecasts over the subperiod 1982-1993. As one sees, the
quasi-operational skill is somewhat lower than the a posterio skill. Over 1982-1993, the
anomaly correlation drops to 0.6 after 8.5 months, and the bias is about −0.3K for longer
lead times.

The reader may check the forecast of Fig. 9, which was made just before this paper
was submitted. It shows the Kalman Filter forecast from February 1997, toghether with
a 32-member ensemble forecast.

A comparison of two-season lead forecasts by Barnston et al. (1994) concentrated
on the relatively well-predictable sub-period 1982–1993. The anomaly correlation of a
quasi-operational two-season lead forecast as deﬁned by Barnston et al., which roughly
corresponds to the anomaly correlation at eight months as presented here, is 0.65 for the
quasi-operational forecasts. This is comparable to the skill of the models considered in
Barnston et al. and signiﬁcantly better than the anomaly-correlation skill of persistence,
which is 0.33 for the period considered.

The above results indicate that the stochastic oscillator is quite capable of succesful

predicting the main ENSO mode.

6 Discussion and conclusions

Two loosely connected themes have been treated in this paper.

The ﬁrst theme is that of the dynamical role of “external noise”. Noise can not only
be important for the irregularity of El Ni˜no, but also could excite El Ni˜no’s. The picture
of El Ni˜no discussed here is that it could be a low-dimensional stable system excited
by external noise. This can be modelled by a stochastic-oscillator equation, because El
Ni˜no is dominated by a single mode. The stochastic-oscillator parameters were shown
to be compatible with the range of values usually assumed for the delayed-oscillator
parameters. Of course, a stable mean process in the stochastic oscillator corresponds to a
stable linearized delayed oscillator. But the parameters found for the stochastic oscillator
indicate a locally unstable process in the delayed oscillator, and by rather small changes
of parameters one can switch from a stable to an unstable delayed oscillator.

The second theme is that El Ni˜no’s can be predicted rather well by an ARMA(2,1)
(autoregressive-moving average) process because the observed autocorrelation function of
El Ni˜no indicators can be parameterized quite well by that of a stochastic oscillator. The
autocorrelation of a stochastic oscillator has three parameters: in addition to a period and
a decay scale, there is a phase shift. This provides a convenient reference in skill for more
comprehensive models. That the ARMA(2,1) model is that succesful is again because El
Ni˜no is dominated by a single mode.

The connection is as follows. If the stochastic oscillator is a good picture of El Ni˜no,
then an ARMA(2,1) model (or a not too fanciful generalisation) should be rather succesful,
although the reverse is not true.

So the stochastic-oscillator picture has passed two important tests — compatibility
with the delayed-oscillator picture, and a forecast model based on the stochastic oscillator
performs well — but remains far from proven.

It is amusing to note that non-linear delayed-oscillator models without external noise
need an unstable basis state while a linear stochastic oscillator needs a stable one. Even
more so because observations indicate that the basic state is part of the year stable
and part of the year unstable. It could be that what is considered noise in the ﬁts to
the stochastic oscillator is actually the manifestation of ﬂuctuations intrinsic to a low-
dimensional chaotic El Ni˜no systen. To resolve this question falls outside the scope of
this article, because the observed timeseries is far too short to make a distinction between
chaos and noise (Tziperman et al. 1994).

The seasonal inﬂuence on El Ni˜no is so large that I could not neglect it altoghether.
It can be represented in a crude way by doing as if the stochastic oscillator applies to the
standarized anomalies.

The form of the stochastic-oscillator equations leads naturally to a Kalman Filter for
forecasting anomalies. The observed NINO3.4 indices are the only input. This ﬁlter
makes rather good forecasts of the main mode of the ENSO system, comparable to the
skills quoted in the study of Barnston et al. (1994). There is no reason to believe that one
cannot do better and gain some precious months in forecast skill. Indeed, recent results,
in particular of models that assimilate sub-surface information (Kleeman et al. 1995, Ji

15

et al. 1996), seem to point to an improvement in model skill in recent years.

Even within the context of the stochastic oscillator, improvement in forecast skill could
come from more comprehensive models. Seasonality might be represented better, data-
assimilation might give an better estimate of the two deterministic degrees of freedom
of the system, and the noise might be better represented and partly predictable. Also,
going slightly beyond the stochastic-oscillator picture, it might very well be that the noise
variance could be dependent on El Ni˜no.

If models as the stochastic oscillator are tuned on relatively short testing periods,

forecast skill may be overestimated considerably.

The stochastic oscillator exhibits substantial decadal variability. This applies not only
to the apperent mean state and that some periods are more active than others. It also
applies to predictability: even with a “perfect” model, during some periods forecasts are
much more succesful than during others.

Appendix A Properties of the stochastic oscillator

The simplest form of the stochastic oscillator is the complex Langevin equation

˙z = −cz + ζ(t)

(A1)

for a complex variable z, with a complex constant c and a noise term ζ. The noise ζ is not
speciﬁed as a given function of time, but it assumed that its average hζi = 0, that ζ(t) is
distributed according a Gaussian law and that its second moment hζ(t)ζ(t − τ )i is given.
The autocorrelation of ζ should go to zero at times much smaller than the mean time
scale | c |−1, for a meaningful separation of mean and stochastic processes to be possible.
(A1) has the formal solution

z = z0e−ct + e−ct

dτ ecτ ζ(τ ) .

(A2)

Z

A clear account of the theory of the real Langevin equation can be found in Balescu
(1975).

In this paper, the discretized form of (A1) is considered:

xi+1 = axi − byi + ξi
yi+1 = bxi + ayi + ηi

for two real variables x and y, real constants a and b and noise terms ξi and ηi. From
(A3) follows the following equation in terms of x alone:

xi+1 = 2axi − (a2 + b2)xi−1 + ξi − aξi−1 − bηi−1 .

16

(A3)

(A4)

In the following, the timescales γ−1 and 2πω−1 will be used. They are deﬁned by

a + ib = e−γ∆t eiω∆t ,

with ∆t the timestep.

Next, the assumption is made that the noise between diﬀerent timesteps in (A3) is
not correlated. Going back to a complex variable and using formal solutions analoguous
to (A2), the following expressions for the variances of the variables x and y in term of the
variances of the noise can be obtained:

hx2i =

1

(q11 + q22)
1 − e−2γ∆t +

(1 − 2e−2γ∆t cos(2ω∆t)) (q11 − q22)

q11 = hξiξii

q12 = hξiηii .

(1 − 2e−2γ∆t cos(2ω∆t)) q12
1 − 2e−2γ∆t cos(2ω∆t) + e−4γ∆t ,

The autocorrelation function of x, ρk = hxi+kxii/hxixii is given by

ρk = e−kγ∆t cos(kω∆t + α)/ cos α ,

tan α = hxyi/hx2i .
(A9)
So in addition to the mean-process timescales γ−1 and ω−1 there is a third parameter in
the autocorrelation function, the phase shift α. The phase shift depends both on the mean
and the noise parameters. In the special case that q12 = 0 and q11 = q22, one has hxyi = 0
and α = 0. In the limit ω → 0, ω tan α → −r, one has ρk → exp(−γk∆t)(1 + rk∆t).

If one would make a POP (Hasselmann 1988) analysis of x and y, or of observed ﬁelds
dominated by a mode linearly related to x and y, then the leading POP mode will have
the stochastic-oscillator period and decay time scale.

Looking only at one variable, the stochastic oscillator reduces to what in term of
autoregressive modelling is called an ARMA(2,1) (autoregressive-moving average) process:

xi+1 = 2axi − (a2 + b2)xi−1 + ǫi − kǫi−1 ,

where the correspondence between the ARMA noise variance

q00 = hǫiǫii

and the noise parameters q11, q22 and q12 is given by

(1 + k2)q00 = (1 + a2)q11 + b2q22 + 2abq12

(A12)

kq00 = aq11 + bq12 .

Note that k and 1/k are equivalent. To one value of k corresponds a curve of combinations
of q22/q11 and q12/q11 which have the same variance and autocorrelation for x but diﬀer
in the variance and autocorrelation of y.

The power spectrum which corresponds to the autocorrelation function of (A8) is in

the limit ∆t → 0 that of a broad peak with a red tail:

S(ω′) =

1
2π (

γ − tan α(ω′ − ω)
(ω′ − ω)2 + γ2 +

γ + tan α(ω′ + ω)
(ω′ + ω)2 + γ2

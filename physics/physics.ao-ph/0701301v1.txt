Abstract

The equilibrium tide-generating forces in the lunar orbital plane of a planet of
radius R are calculated for the case of N moons of mass Mi orbiting the planet at
instantaneous polar coordinates (Di, αi). For the case of a single moon, there are
only two high tides. For the case of two moons, it is found that there can exist a
critical lunar orbital distance at which two high tides become unstable with respect
to formation of three high tides. Bifurcation diagrams are presented which depict
how the angular positions of the high and low tides on the planet vary with the
lunar distances and lunar separation angle. Tidal stability diagrams, which illustrate
the stability regions for various tidal patterns as a function of lunar distances and
lunar separation angle, are presented for various values of D2/D1 and M2/M1.
Generally speaking, the aforementioned tidal instability, and hence the propensity
for formation of three high tides on a two-moon planet, exists over a signiﬁcant
range of lunar distances and separation angles provided that M2/M1 ∼ (D2/D1)3.
For the case of N > 2 moons, the tidal stability diagram becomes more complex,
revealing a diversity of potential tidal patterns.

1 Introduction

High precision measurements have led to the detection of over 170 extraso-
lar planets in recent years (Perryman, 2000; Butler et al., 2006). Theoretical
work has been devoted to developing models of planetary formation (Wetherill,
1996; Ida and Lin, 2004, 2005; Raymond et al., 2006; Yamoto and Sekiya, 2006;
Kokubo et al., 2006), and to assessing the likelihood that terrestrial extra-solar
planets have liquid on their surface and are habitable (Kasting et al., 1993;
Gaidos and Williams, 2004; Ikoma and Genda, 2006). Moreover, numerical
simulations have demonstrated that a giant-impact scenario (Hartmann and Davis,
1975; Cameron and Ward, 1976) can, in certain cases, give rise to multiple
moons orbiting such a terrestrial planet (Ida et al., 1997; Canup et al., 1999).
Regardless of the causal history, it is manifestly clear that terrestrial planets
can in fact be orbited by multiple moons. For example, Deimos and Phobos
orbit Mars. If such a terrestrial planet were covered by liquid water, one would
expect to observe ocean tides on the surface of the planet.

In this paper, we investigate, from a theoretical viewpoint, the tidal pattern
on putative multi-moon planets covered with a uniform layer of ﬂuid. By tidal
pattern we mean the total number of high and low tides which result from the
azimuthal component of the tide-generating forces. Our results suggest that
unexpected tidal instabilities arise due to gravitational gradients produced by
multiple moons in the vicinity of the planet. In particular, there typically exist
one or more critical lunar distances at which bifurcations occur between situ-
ations in which diﬀerent numbers of high tides are stable. To our knowledge,
these instabilities have not hitherto been systematically investigated.

2 Background

Tidal patterns in an ocean covering a planet can be very complex. These com-
plexities arise due to local meteorological and geographic conditions, multiple
nearby gravitating bodies executing non-trivial orbital patterns around the
planet, and ﬂuid inertia, friction, and viscosity (for a review, see Cartwright
(1977)). In the absence of all of these complicating factors, it is believed that
the tidal patterns themselves would be much simpler. Newton (1952) demon-
strated that a single gravitating body located near a planet will induce two
tidal bulges, one on either side of the planet. Thus, his theory predicts semi-
diurnal tides. Moreover, the presence of a second gravitating body in the neigh-
borhood of the planet can enhance the tidal bulges when the second body is in
conjunction (or opposition) with the ﬁrst, or diminish the tidal bulges when it
is in quadrature with the ﬁrst. Thus, his theory also predicts spring and neap
tides. Newton’s was an equilibrium theory, in that he neglected the inertia of

2

the water, assuming the height of the tides to be completely determined by
the instantaneous positions of the nearby gravitating bodies.

An important failure of Newton’s theory was its inability to explain the gen-
eral lack of temporal coincidence of high tides at a particular meridian with
the instant at which the moon is directly overhead. Laplace (1969) attempted
to describe the dynamic response of the oceans to a simple periodic tide-
generating force by developing a non-equilibrium theory of the ocean tides.
The real tide-generating force, however, is not simple because, among other
things, the moon and the sun themselves exhibit non-trivial orbits relative
to the earth. In order to deal with complex tidal forces, the method of har-
monic analysis was developed (Kelvin, 1910; Darwin, 1962; Doodson, 1921;
Munk and Cartwright, 1966). This technique consists of reconstructing a tide-
generating force from the spectral components of an observed tidal time-series
at a particular geographical location. To each spectral component, or partial
wave, one attempts to identify a particular periodic cause, such as the daily
rotation of the earth, the monthly orbit of the moon, or the creep of the moon’s
nodes along the solar ecliptic.

We would like to emphasize that from the viewpoint of harmonic analysis,
the complexity of the tidal pattern is thought to arise as a result of, ﬁrst, the
complexity of the relative motion of the earth, the moon, and the sun, and
second, the dynamic response of the water to the tide generating forces. On
the other hand, Newton’s equilibrium theory is thought to predict relatively
simple tidal phenomena, namely the existence of semi-diurnal tides, spring
tides, and neap tides. In this paper we demonstrate that, even within the
framework of Newton’s equilibrium theory, non-trivial tidal patterns can arise
on the surface of a ﬂuid covered planet due to the action of multiple gravitating
bodies in its vicinity.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 3, we ﬁrst enumerate the assump-
tions of our equilibrium planetary model. We then derive the tide-generating
potential function from ﬁrst principles by considering the forces acting on a
point on the surface of a planet orbited by a single moon at distance D. We
perform this derivations so as to clearly illustrate that, within equilibrium
theory, the tide-generating forces caused by a single moon can not give rise
to more than two high tides in the lunar orbital plane of the planet. We then
generalize our equations so as to account for the tide-generating forces caused
by N moons.

In Sec. 4, we study the case of two moons orbiting a planet of radius R. First,
we consider the special case of two identical moons orbiting the planet at iden-
tical distances, D, and at angular positions +α and −α. We demonstrate the
appearance of a tidal instability at a particular value of R/D, which depends
upon the lunar separation half-angle, α. This instability separates regions of

3

parameter space in which the ﬂuid surface is characterized by diﬀerent num-
bers of high tides. Physically, the angular separation of the moons and their
proximity to the planet’s surface dictate whether the higher order harmon-
ics in the tide-generating potential are able to induce tidal separation. By
systematically varying these parameters, we can calculate the number and
angular positions of the high and low tides for diﬀerent values of R/D and
α. The results of these calculations are illustrated in a number of bifurcation
diagrams.

We then relax the assumption that the moons orbit at identical distances, so
as to study whether the tidal instability persists for more realistic scenarios. It
does, and the results of this investigation are presented in a stability diagram.
The stability diagram depicts the location of the transition, in parameter
space, from two to three high tides, as a function of the lunar separation half-
angle. If the moons are at diﬀerent orbital distances, they will of course be
orbiting at diﬀerent rates, and hence the lunar separation angle will be grad-
ually changing. But within equilibrium theory, the tides will adopt a pattern
determined by the instantaneous position of the moons.

Next, we consider the case in which both the orbital distances and the lunar
masses diﬀer. We ﬁnd again that the instability persists. We also derive a
law governing the zero stability point, which is deﬁned in the text. Next, we
check our results to make sure that they do not contradict the tidal behavior
observed on earth due to the combined action of the moon and the sun. We
also speculate about the types of planetary systems which might demonstrate
tidal instabilities such as are predicted in this paper.

In Sec. 5, we brieﬂy consider the case of three moons orbiting a planet at
identical distances, and we present the associated stability diagram. Finally,
in Sec. 6, we summarize our results and highlight the diﬀerences between ours
and those of previous theoretical studies of tide formation.

3 Tide generating potential

Consider the situation in which a single moon orbits a planet, as depicted in
Fig. 1. We assume that the planet is perfectly rigid and that its mass distribu-
tion is spherically symmetric about the center of mass, P . We also assume, as
did Newton, that the tidal pattern is determined by the instantaneous posi-
tions of the local masses. The masses of the planet and the moon are MP and
M1, respectively. A cartesian coordinate system, XY , is ﬁxed at the center
of the planet. This coordinate system lies in the plane of the lunar orbit. For
simplicity, we take the lunar orbital plane to be coincident with the equatorial
plane of the planet. The vector ~D1 indicates the instantaneous position of the

orbiting moon. The coordinate system is oriented such that this vector makes
an angle α1 with the abscissa. Positive angles are measured clockwise from the
abscissa. The vector ~R points to an arbitrary point, S, on the surface of the
planet, and makes an angle, θ, with the abscissa. The vector ~d1 points from
the moon to the point S. For simplicity, we consider all vectors to lie in the
lunar orbital plane. Thus our analysis is conﬁned to the tidal pattern which
arises on the planetary equator. 1

A unit mass at point S experiences forces due to the gravitational attraction
of the planet, ~FP , and the moon, ~F1.

~F1 = −GM1 ~d1/d3

Here, G is the universal gravitational contant. There also arise ﬁctitious forces
on the unit mass due to the rotation of the planet, ~Fω, and due to the fact
that the planet is falling toward the moon, ~F ′
1.

1

In the event that the orbital and equatorial planes are obliquely oriented, the
computed tidal pattern will be in the orbital, not the equatorial, plane. Even within
the context of equilibrium theory, the tides will be distorted by the dependence of
the centrifugal force on longitude, but the number of low and high tides will not
be aﬀected, since the centrifugal force is purely radial, and it is the azimuthal force
that causes tidal separation.

In ~Fω, ω describes the angular speed of the planet’s rotation. This term, which
represents the centrifugal force exerted at point S, is purely radially directed,
and hence cannot induce tidal separation. Adding the above equations, and
neglecting the manifestly radially directed forces, we ﬁnd that the net tide-
generating force is just the sum of the attractive, gravitational forces and the
repulsive, non-inertial forces:

Eq. 3 still contains both azimuthal and radial components; we wish to isolate
the azimuthal component. We do this by ﬁrst writing all vectors in terms of
their cartesian components. Using vector addition, we write

~d1 = [R cos (θ) − D1 cos (α1)] ˆx + [R sin (θ) − D1 sin (α1)] ˆy.

Also, the magnitude of ~d1 can be written in terms of R, D1, α1 and θ.

Eq. 5 describes the tide-generating forces acting in the lunar orbital plane
of a planet orbited by a single moon of mass M1 with instantaneous polar
coordinates (D1, α1). If there is a thin layer of ﬂuid covering the surface of
the planet at radius R, this ﬂuid can experience tidal separation due to these
forces. They tend to heap up (or spread out) water at particular angular
locations, causing high tides (or low tides) to form.

In the literature, it is common to infer the tide-generating forces from a tide-
generating potential function. From our perspective, the tide-generating po-
tential function can be obtained by integrating Eq. 5 with respect θ:

The tide-generating potential function, given by Eqs. 6 or 7, can be used to
obtain a formula for the height of the water above or below the equilibrium
water height that would exist in the absence of tidal forcing due to a nearby
gravitating body. In particular, the diﬀerence in height can be computed from
the tide-generating potential, V , the local acceleration of gravity, g, and a
number of assumptions about the density and elasticity of the planet itself.

The density and elasticity of the planet are relevant because the planet is also
deformed by the moon’s gravity (Melchoir, 1966). The overall eﬀect of this de-
formation is to reduce the amplitude of the ocean tides by a factor of (1+k−h).
Here, k is the love number representing the variation in the tide-generating
potential produced by the planet due to the redistribution of the planet’s ma-
terial in response to the tide-generating potential of the moon(s). h is the love
number representing the variation of the surface height of the planet. Calcula-
tion of these love numbers relies upon the assumption that the planetary tides,
like the ocean tides, are generated by the tide-generating potential, and that
they can therefore be expanded in terms of Legendre polynomials. There are
signiﬁcant problems, however, with truncating the tide-generating potential,
as we shall explain shortly. In any case, in this paper we consider the case of
a perfectly rigid planet, which implies that h = k = l = 0. Consequently the
tidal amplitude correction factor mentioned above is reduced to unity. Thus
the tidal height can be obtained by simply dividing the tide-generating poten-
tial by the local gravitational acceleration. Since we are here interested only in
classifying transitions between diﬀerent tidal patterns, it is not critical at this
point to obtain an exact expression for the tidal heights. We henceforth sim-
ply identify the maxima and minima of the tide-generating potential function
with the locations of the high and low tides, respectively, which are formed
on the surface of the planet.

It is sometimes convenient to transform the tide-generating potential from
local coordinates (θ and α) into geographic and astronomical coordinates using
the formula

cos (θ − α) = sin (φ) sin (δ) + cos (φ) cos (δ) cos (H).

(8)

Here, φ and H are the geographic latitude and hour angle of the observer and
δ is the declination of the moon (Doodson, 1921). Since this mathematical
transformation can not change the physical structure of the predicted tidal
pattern, and since it will increase the notational complexity of our discussion,
we will not make use of Eq. 8.

7

Returning to Eq. 7, when R/D1 is small, the series converges quickly. This is
the case for the earth-moon system, in which R/D1 ≃ 0.017. The n = 2 term
gives rise to two tidal maxima; the n = 3 and higher terms deform these tides
slightly, but are not large enough to produce additional maxima or minima in
the potential function. In this sense, truncating the expansion after the n = 2
term will not change the predicted tidal pattern.

On the other hand, when R/D1 is suﬃciently large, it might seem that the
higher order terms in Eq. 7 could give rise to not just two, but perhaps three
or more tidal maxima. A bit of reﬂection, however, reveals that this is not the
case. First, it should be noted that the Legendre polynomials form a complete
set for a large class of functions, of which Eq. 6 is an example. It would be
incorrect to assume that a function that can be expanded in terms of Legendre
polynomials must have multiple maxima simply because of the existence of
high order terms in its expansion.

It is true that Eq. 7 could predict more than two maxima if one could in-
dependently vary the coeﬃcients in front of the diﬀerent order terms. In the
present case, however, the coeﬃcients of the various Pn are prescribed powers
of R/D1, and cannot be independently varied. It is also true that Eq. 7 could
predict more than two maxima if one were to make the coeﬃcient R/D1 large,
and then simply truncate the expansion after a few terms. This, however, is
not appropriate when R/D1 is large, since in such a case the subsequent higher
order terms are relevant in that they actually suppress the appearance of more
than two maxima in Eq. 7. This important point is illustrated in Fig 2.

This ﬁgure depicts the tide-generating potential as a function of θ for two
values of R/D1. In both upper and lower diagrams, the solid line represents
the closed form expression (Eq. 6) and the dashed line represent the series
expansion (Eq. 7) which has been truncated after the fourth order legendre
polynomial. The upper diagram shows that the two formulas predict the same
number of high and low tides for the case of R/D1 = 0.5. The lower diagram
shows that the two formulas predict a diﬀerent number of high and low tides
for the case of R/D1 = 0.99. 2 Clearly this spurious behavior is an artifact of
the truncation and is not a characteristic of the potential function itself. For
this reason, we henceforth do not resort to the legendre polynomial expansion
of the potential. Rather, we use the closed form expression for the potential,

2 In the lower diagram it was necessary to limit the vertical range of the axis,
and hence cut oﬀ the maximum of the closed form expression near θ = 0, so as to
illustrate the additional maxima and minima in the series expansion near θ/π =
±0.6. As R/D1 approaches unity, the potential blows up at θ/π = 0. This is an
artifact of the unphysical scenario where the moon orbits on the surface of the
planet. We chose the large value of R/D1 in this diagram only to illustrate the
diﬀerent predictions of the closed form and the truncated series expansions of the
tide-generating potential.

Here, Mi, Di, and αi are the lunar mass, lunar distance, and angular position
of the ith moon. Eq. 9 is the fundamental formula from which can be found the
locations of the high and low tides at any instant at polar coordinates (R, θ)
in the lunar orbital plane of a planet orbited by N moons. In the remainder
of the paper, we analyze the properties of Eq. 9.

4 Tidal action for two moons

4.1 Identical lunar masses and distances

Let us restrict our attention at ﬁrst to the case of two moons orbiting a planet.
It will prove convenient henceforth to refer to M2/M1 as the mass ratio, and to
D2/D1 as the distance ratio. Let us consider the special case in which both the
mass ratio and the distance ratio are unity: M1 = M2 ≡ M and D1 = D2 ≡ D.
For symmetry, we orient the coordinate system such that α1 = −α2 ≡ α. The
parameter α thus describes the lunar separation half-angle. Eq. 9 now becomes

We shall henceforth refer to the quantity R/D as the planetary radius 3 and
the quantity α/π as the lunar angle. In Eq. 10, we have normalized so that
the potential is measured in units of GM/D.

orbital distance.

Fig. 3. The tide-generating potential as a function of θ for R/Rc < 1 (dotted
line) and R/Rc > 1 (solid line). The potential is measured in units of Gm/D. The
instantaneous angular position of the moons are here taken to be α/π = ±0.2.

Eq. 10 is plotted as a function of θ for two values of planetary radius in Fig. 3.
In this diagram, we have chosen to use a lunar angle of 0.2. First, consider
the dotted line, representing the case in which the planetary radius is 0.15.
There exist high tides at θ/π = 0 and 1, and low tides at θ/π ≈ ±0.52. This
is consistent with a well known tidal pattern, an ellipse, with its major axis
aligned along the abscissa of our coordinate system.

Now consider the solid line in Fig. 3, representing the case in which the plan-
etary radius is 0.27. The high tide at θ/π = 1 is still at θ/π = 1. However,
now the point at θ = 0 has become a low tide. The high tide at θ = 0, when
the planetary radius was 0.15, has split into two high tides separated by a low
tide at θ = 0. A bifurcation has occurred at some intermediate value of the
planetary radius. Previously, the second order multipole moment dominated
the tide generating potential. The bifurcation signals the point at which higher
order multipole moments become signiﬁcant. As a result of the bifurcation,
the tidal pattern no longer resembles an ellipse, but rather has three lobes,
or three high tides. The angular orientation of these lobes will be discussed
shortly. Generally speaking, the number of high and low tides is indicated by
the number of maxima and minima occurring in Eq. 10 for a given value of

11

the planetary radius. It should be noted that high tides are always separated
by low tides, so the number of high and low tides are always equal.

In order to determine the critical value of the planetary radius at which the
bifurcation occurs between the two tidal patterns for a given lunar angle, we
can make a plot of the maxima and minima of Eq. 10 as a function of both
planetary radius and θ. Such plots are shown in Fig. 4 for six diﬀerent values
of the lunar angle. Solid lines represent the angular positions of high tides;
dotted lines represent the angular positions of low tides. Note that the right
edge of each plot has either a solid or a dotted line, indicating a particular
type of tide.

Several important points should be made regarding Fig. 4. Recall that Fig. 3
depicted the tide-generating potential for a lunar angle α = 0.20 for the special
cases of R/D = 0.15 and 0.27. Consider now the plot in the lower left corner
of Fig. 4. This is the bifurcation plot for the same lunar angle. The values
R/D = 0.15 and 0.27 are indicated by horizontal dashed lines. Notice that
when R/D = 0.15, there are two high tides (θ/π = 0 and θ/π = 1) and two
low tides (θ/π ≈ ±0.52). Most notably, a bifurcation occurs near R/D ≈ 0.23
where the high tide at θ/π = 0 splits into two high tides. Therefore when
R/D = 0.27, there are three high tides (θ/π ≈ ±0.12 and θ/π = 1) and three
low tides (θ/π ≈ ±0.55 and θ/π = 0). Generally speaking, for lunar angles
between zero and 0.25, the high tide at θ = 0 bifurcates into two high tides
at a critical planetary radius, Rc/D, which depends on the lunar angle. When
R/D > Rc/D, the angular positions of the newly formed high tides vary with
planetary radius, approaching the angular positions of the two moons as the
planetary radius approaches unity. In other words, when the moons are very
close to the surface of the planet, the high tides tend to be directly beneath
the moons.

Now consider the plot in the upper left corner. When the two moons are very
close to one another, the lunar angle approaches zero. In the limit in which the
lunar angle is zero, there are just two low tides and two high tides. There is no
bifurcation. In this case, the angular positions of the low tides depend on the
planetary radius, but those of the high tides are constant, at θ/π = 0 and 1.
Although it is impossible for two moons to be on top of one another, the
case of zero lunar angle can be interpreted physically as the case of just a
single moon orbiting a planet. This demonstrates that, within the equilibrium
conditions assumed here, it is not possible for more than two high tides to
form when a single moon orbits a planet, as was stated in Sec. 2.

Finally, consider the plots in the right hand column. For a lunar angle of 0.25
(when the moons are in quadrature) there exist three high tides for all values
of the planetary radius. For lunar angles greater than 0.25, it is not the high
tide at θ = 0 that bifurcates into two high tides, but rather the low tide at

tide at θ/π = 1. Again, as the planetary radius approaches unity, the angular
positions of two of the high tides approach the angular positions of the two
moons. The angular position of the third high tide is always at θ/π = 1.

The results presented here will be revisited in the stability diagram presented
in Sec. 4.2, where we consider the more general case in which the moons are

13

not constrained to orbit at the same distance.

4.2 Identical lunar masses, diﬀerent distances

We retain the assumption that the mass ratio is unity. We use the same pro-
cedure as before, except that in Eq. 10 we ﬁx D1 and allow both the planetary
radius, R/D1, and the distance ratio, D2/D1, to vary. Since the orbital dis-
tances diﬀer, the lunar angle will be changing over time as the moons orbit
the planet at diﬀerent angular speeds. In our analysis we are assuming this is
happening suﬃciently slowly on the time scale of the ﬂuid response that the
equilibrium theory is justiﬁed.

The bifurcation plots for this scenario (not shown) are similar to the ones
depicted in Fig. 4 in that they reveal a critical planetary radius, Rc/D1, at
which a transition between two and three high tides occurs. However, the value
of the critical planetary radius now depends upon both the lunar angle and
the distance ratio. This is illustrated in the stability diagram of Fig. 5.

The top diagram of Fig. 5 depicts the case in which the mass ratio is unity and
the distance ratio is permitted to vary. The legend indicates which symbols
correspond to which value of the distance ratio. For clarity, we only depict
data for ﬁve values of the distance ratio. As an example of how to read the
top diagram of Fig. 5, consider the open circles which appear in that plot.
These correspond to the special case, considered in Sec. 4.1, in which the two
moons orbit at the same distance from the planet. From the bifurcation plots
of Fig. 4, recall that for α = 0.20, a bifurcation occurs when R/D1 ≈ 0.23.
Correspondingly, there is an open circle in the top diagram of Fig. 5 at the
coordinates (α/π = 0.20, R/D1 ≈ 0.23). The string of open circles, then,
represents a stability boundary. Above the stability boundary, three high tides
are stable; below the stability boundary, two high tides are stable.

We can make the following general observations regarding the top diagram of
Fig. 5. First, the location of the stability boundary depends upon the distance
ratio of the moons. As the distance ratio increases from 1.0 toward 2.0, the
region in which three high tides are stable becomes narrower.

Physically, this occurs because when the second moon is farther from the
planet’s surface, its gravitational ﬁeld is less capable of raising a separate
tide. Not shown in the ﬁgure is that when the mass ratio is unity and the
distance ratio exceeds 1.94, the region of three high tides vanishes entirely,
leaving only two high tides.

Second, when the distance ratio is unity, the critical planetary radius has a
value of zero at lunar angle 0.25. This point we henceforth refer to as a zero

(radius) stability point. This means that at this lunar angle, three high tides
will be stable for any planetary radius. We will discuss the zero stability point
in greater detail in Sec. 4.5.

Third, when the distance ratio diﬀers from unity, there is no longer a zero
stability point, and the critical planetary radius generally has minima at two

15

diﬀerent lunar angles. This implies that for such a system, as the lunar angle
changes during the course of the lunar orbits, the planet can experience al-
ternating periods of high and low tides. Consider, for instance, a hypothetical
system for which R/D1 ≈ 0.41 (the horizontal dashed line) and for which
D2/D1 = 1.3. As the lunar angle changes between zero and 0.40, the planet
will experience ﬁrst two, then three, then two, then three, and ﬁnally two high
tides.

4.3 Identical distances, diﬀerent masses

Now let us ﬁx the distance ratio at unity and allow the mass ratio to vary. This
is depicted in the bottom diagram of Fig. 5. Like the top diagram, it depicts
the stability boundary between regions of parameter space in which two and
three high tides are stable. Unlike the top diagram, the various symbols now
represent diﬀerent values of the mass ratio, as noted in the legend. For clarity,
we only show data for four values of the mass ratio between 0.1 and 1.0. It is
apparent from this diagram that the instability persists even when the masses
are not identical. Qualitatively, as far as the shape of the stability boundaries
is concerned, the eﬀect of reducing the mass of the second moon is similar to
that of increasing its distance from the surface of the planet. In either case,
the second moon is less capable of raising a separate tide.

4.4 The Roche Limit

In the previous two sections, we considered separately the eﬀects of lunar
mass and lunar orbital radii on the formation of tidal patterns. In the following
section, we will combine these results so as to derive a formula which prescribes
the conditions which would render the formation of more than two high tides
likely. Before proceeding, however, we should ask whether the orbital radii
which we have been considering are in fact physically obtainable. That is: is it
reasonable to suggest that the planetary radius can range anywhere between
almost zero and almost unity?

Obviously, when the planetary radius is close to unity, the moon is orbiting
practically on the surface of the planet, which is unrealistic. But what is a
reasonable value of R/D for a lunar orbit? The Roche limit (Roche, 1847-1850)
is the planetary radius above which the host planet’s tidal forces acting on the
orbiting moon exceed the moon’s gravitational self-attraction. If the planetary
radius is larger than the Roche limit, an orbiting moon would probably not
have formed by accretion. The exact value of the Roche limit depends upon
the rigidity and density of the moon. Assuming a ﬂuid moon whose density is
the same as that of the host planet, the Roche limit is approximately 0.41; a

16

rigid moon yields a value closer to 0.79. The Roche limit of 0.41 is depicted
in both the upper and lower diagrams of Fig. 5 as a horizontal dashed line.
It is notable that there still exists a signiﬁcant region of parameter space
(0 < R/D < 0.41) such that a moon formed by accretion could generate
multiple tides on the surface of its host planet. The less conservative value of
the Roche limit yields an even larger region.

4.5 Diﬀerent distances and masses

Now let us consider scenarios in which both the distance and the mass ratios
diﬀer from unity. In Fig. 6, we show how the stability boundaries vary over
four decades of the mass ratio, for three diﬀerent values of the distance ratio.
The stability diagrams in Fig. 6 are similar to those in Fig. 5, except that
they are turned on their side, and that the planetary radius is plotted versus
the mass ratio instead of the lunar angle. Fig. 6 is designed to highlight the
variation of the zero stability point, deﬁned in Sec. 4.2, with mass ratio.

In the bottom diagram, the distance ratio is ﬁxed at unity. The legend indicates
ﬁve values of the lunar angle between 0.05 and 0.25. For instance, at lunar
angle 0.25 (denoted by triangles), the critical planetary radius is zero when
the mass ratio is unity. This is our zero stability point.

In the middle and top diagrams of Fig. 6, we show how the stability boundaries
vary with mass ratio when the distance ratios are 1.3 and 1.5, respectively.
Now the zero stability point occurs when the mass ratio is larger then unity.
Notice that the zero stability point always occurs at a lunar angle of 0.25.

One can study how the zero stability point depends upon the distance ratio.
This is depicted in Fig. 7. The open circles represent the calculated zero sta-
bility points. The solid circle represents the lunar mass and distance ratios of
the Saturnian moons Mimas and Enceladus (we shall return to this shortly).
The solid line in Fig. 7 is a power law ﬁt,

(M2/M1)z = A + B (D2/D1)γ
z ,

(11)

to the calculated zero stability points. The subscript, z, indicates that these are
the lunar mass and distance ratios at the zero stability point. The ﬁtting pa-
rameters have the values A = 0.00 ±0.04, B = 1.00 ±0.03 and γ = 2.99 ±0.04.
The uncertainties in the ﬁtting parameters indicate one standard deviation
conﬁdence intervals.

Our analysis implies that for any value of the distance ratio, there is a corre-
sponding value of the mass ratio at which there must be three high tides, when
the moons are in quadrature. Moreover, our analysis implies that when Eq. 11

over which three high tides will form for a particular planetary radius. Practi-
cally, Eq. 11 serves as a guide in predicting which two-moon systems are likely
to exhibit three high tides. Physically, Eq. 11 states that there can be three
high tides on a planet with one very distant moon and one very near moon,
provided that the more distant moon is more massive than the nearby moon.

between the mass ratio and the distance ratio for Mimas and Enceladus, two moons
of Saturn. The closed square represents the relationship between the mass ratio and
the distance ratio for the moon and the sun relative to the earth.

Recall, however, that moons with diﬀerent orbital radii will have diﬀerent or-
bital periods, and hence the lunar angle will not be constant. Consequently,
a two moon planet could experience three high tides for some duration, and
two high tides for a diﬀerent duration, of the time it takes the moons to orbit
the planet.

4.6 Earth-moon-sun, Saturn-Mimas-Enceladus, and other systems

Let us use the equilibrium analysis developed thus far to predict the tidal
pattern on the surface of the earth from the combined action of the sun and
the moon. The solid square in the inset of Fig. 7 represents the mass and
distance ratios for the moon, M1, and the sun, M2, orbiting the earth. 4 These

values are provided in Tab. .1. The solid line in the inset of Fig. 7 is the power
law ﬁt to our calculated zero stability points extrapolated over approximately
three decades of mass ratio. Incidentally, the earth-moon-sun system lies fairly
close to the extrapolated line of zero stability points. This seems to suggest
that there might be three high tides on the earth when the moon and sun are
in quadrature. We show next that this is not, however, the case.

In Fig. 8 we show a stability diagram, much like those in Fig. 5. In this case,
however, the closed squares form the stability boundary speciﬁcally for the
earth-moon-sun system. The reason that the earth exhibits two, rather than
three, high tides each day is that the planetary radius of the earth is approxi-
mately R/D = 0.017. This planetary radius is depicted as a horizontal dotted
line near the bottom of the plot. Clearly this lies far below even the lowest
point on the stability boundary. Our analysis is therefore consistent with the
existence of semi-diurnal tides on the earth. Were the earth larger, such that
R/D1 ≈ 0.55, then we could expect three high tides, rather than two high
tides, during certain phases of the moon. Interestingly, the moon was likely
much nearer the earth shortly after its origin, implying that such conditions
may have been fulﬁlled early in the moon’s history (Hartmann et al., 1984).

The earth-moon-sun system does not exhibit three high tides. Should we ex-
pect any realistic system to exhibit three high tides? Having two moons, Mars
is a candidate. Unfortunately, Mars has no oceans. Furthermore, Mars’ more
distant moon, Deimos, is less massive than its nearby moon, Phobos. Therefore
even if Mars did have surface oceans, we would expect it to have only semi-
diurnal tides. Considering non-terrestrial planets, both Saturn and Jupiter
have many moons, but no surface oceans. It just so happens, however, that
two of Saturn’s moons, Mimas and Enceladus, satisfy the conditions to pro-
duce three high tides on the surface of Saturn: the Saturn-Mimas-Enceladus
system lies very close to the line of predicted zero-stability points in Fig. 7.
For the sake of argument, let us suppose that these were Saturn’s only two
moons. In Fig. 8, the closed circles form the stability boundary for the Saturn-
Mimas-Enceladus system. Notice that the stability boundary dips to very low
values of the planetary radius. The horizontal dashed line at R/D = 0.324 rep-
resents the planetary radius of Saturn. If Saturn only had these two moons,
one would expect three high tides on the surface of Saturn for lunar angles
between approximately 0.20 and 0.28.

On the other hand, if Io and Europa were Jupiter’s only two moons, they
would not raise three high tides on the surface of Jupiter. This is because the
more distant moon, Europa, is less massive than the nearby moon, Io.

tides. There are complications, which we are neglecting, that arise from the fact
that the orbital plane of the moon is oblique to the ecliptic.

5 Three moons

In principle, the tidal structure of any N moon planet can be determined
from Eq. 9. As a (relatively) simple example, we consider brieﬂy the case of
a three-moon planet. We assume that the moons have identical masses and
orbital distances, and we place them at lunar angles 0 and ±α. The stability
diagram for this system is illustrated in Fig. 9. It displays a somewhat more
complicated structure. The number of high tides in each region of parameter
space is indicated by a boxed integer in that region. It should be noted that
any number of high tides between two and four can be stable in some region
of parameter space. In general, we suspect that for N moons, any number of
high tides between 2 and N + 1 could, in principle, be stable.

6 Conclusion

We have studied the tide-generating forces which act on the surface of a planet
covered by a uniform layer of ﬂuid and orbited by multiple moons. We found
that the tidal pattern depends upon the orbital distances and the angular
separation of the moons. In particular, we found a tidal instability at a critical
radius, Rc/D, which depends upon the lunar angles, the mass ratios, and
the distance ratios of the orbiting moons. The tidal instability gives rise to
transitions between states in which diﬀerent numbers of high tides are stable.
Physically, the tidal instability can be thought of as a transition between
states in which diﬀerent multipole moments of the tide-generating potential
are dominant.

We have compared our results to those of Kapoulitsas (1985), who, in the spirit
of Newton’s equilibrium theory, derived a formula for the height of the water
surface on a planet orbited by two gravitating bodies, which he considered to
be the sun and the moon. After computing the partial tides due to both the

2

 α / π 

22

sun and the moon, he concluded that, “to the order of approximation adopted,
the tidal height of the combined action of [the moon and the sun] is obtained
by adding the tidal heights due to each.”

Our results agree with those of Kapoulitsas in the limiting case that there are
two gravitating bodies and that these are taken to be the sun and the moon,
with the appropriate mass and distance ratios. In the general case, however,
our results disagree with those of Kapoulitsas. He arrives at his formulae for
the tidal height by truncating the expansion of the tide-generating potential
function in powers of the planetary radius, keeping only terms up to second
order. He does this so as to arrive at an analytic expression for the tidal
height, which in turn supports his assertion that the tidal height caused by
the combined action of the two gravitating bodies is approximated by adding
the tidal heights due to each independently. His ﬁnal formula, Eq. 3.5, however,
implies that two identical moons orbiting at the same distances would never
produce three high tides in the lunar orbital plane. Rather, they would produce
two high tides in every case except when the moons are in quadrature, in which
case there would be no tidal height variation at all.

This is in marked contrast with the results presented in this paper. In light of
the results presented here, this problem arises because the higher order terms
in the tide-generating potential function are omitted. We have demonstrated
that in order to correctly identify the nature of the transition between diﬀerent
tidal patterns on multi-moon planets, it is necessary to utilize a closed-form
expression for the tide-generating potential function. This provides a tech-
nique for predicting tidal phenomena on putative extra-solar planets orbited
by multiple moons. It is conceivable that an extra-solar planet might fulﬁll the
conditions described in this paper which would allow for the stability of three
or more high tides over some region of time during the lunar orbits. Generally
speaking, the study of tidal phenomena on extra-solar planets could prove
extremely useful in exploring their composition and formation.

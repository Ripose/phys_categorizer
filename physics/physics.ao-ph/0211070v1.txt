Abstract. The paper summarises activities within a broad-based research program for the reconstruction of the
evolution of Italian climate in the twentieth century. The main result of the program is that Italian climate is
becoming warmer and drier with an increase of both heavy precipitation events and long dry spells. Most of the
observed signals appear to be due to changes in atmospheric circulation causing an increase in the frequency of
subtropical anticyclones over the western Mediterranean basin. This hypothesis is also supported by the evolution
of Italian total cloud amount in the 1951-1996 period.

1. Introduction

Around the mid 1990s, the authors set up a broad-based research program with the aim of better understanding the evo-
lution of Italian climate in the last 100/150 years. The program was developed both within European (UE IMPROVE
and ALPCLIM projects) and National projects (National Research Council (CNR) project ”Reconstruction of the Past
Climate in the Mediterranean area”). At present it is in progress within the ”Progetto Finalizzato CLIMAGRI”, a
project of the Italian ”Ministero per le Politiche Agricole e Forestali”. Moreover, in the next two years, further activities
will be performed within the research program ”Local climate variability in relation to global climatic change phenom-
ena” funded by the Italian ”Ministero per l’Istruzione, l’Universit e la Ricerca” and by Genoa, Milan, Trieste, Turin
and Udine Universities. The studies so far carried out have improved the availability and the quality of Italian data
and have produced interesting information on the evolution of temperature, precipitation and some other parameters
in the last 100/150 years. The paper summarises the main results obtained within the research program.

2. Data and methods

In Italy there are several historical series, but only a few of them are digitalized and available for climatological studies,
while most are still on paper archives. With the exception of some well known series (e.g. Milan, Padua and Rome),
the construction of the most important database, so far available, of long historical series of Italian meteorological data
started in the 70s in the framework of a CNR Project. In the second part of the 90s this database was updated and
improved in the framework of the CNR Special Project ”Ricostruzione del clima dell’area mediterranea nel passato”.
The series included in the database are listed in table 1, and their geographical distribution is shown in ﬁgure 1. All
series include monthly mean values of daily maximum (Tmax), mean (T) and minimum (Tmin) temperatures and
monthly total precipitation (P), part of them include daily observations too.

Monthly series were divided in two groups corresponding to two climatically homogeneous areas - Northern Italy
(N) and Central-Southern Italy (S) - that are, respectively, the continental and the peninsular zones of Italy (Lo
Vecchio and Nanni, 1995; Buﬀoni et al., 1999). After establishing the new database, the Craddock homogeneity test

(Craddock, 1979) was applied to the Tmin, T, Tmax and P series, using regional means as reference series (Maugeri
and Nanni, 1998; Buﬀoni et al., 1999). Some series were then homogenized (Auer, 1992; B¨ohm, 1992) both on the
basis of the test results and the stations’ history (metadata). After homogenization, the temperature (precipitation)
series were completed over the period 1865-1996 (1833-1996) by means of a procedure described in Maugeri and Nanni
(1998) and in Buﬀoni et al. (1999). With the completed data, monthly mean values of the Daily Temperature Range
(DTR) were calculated from Tmin and Tmax series. Following the procedure described in Maugeri and Nanni (1998);
Buﬀoni et al. (1999); Brunetti et al. (2000a,b) the T, Tmin, Tmax, DTR and P series were then averaged over N and S
and seasonal and yearly anomalies and their 5-y running means were calculated. Seasonal and yearly N and S average
anomalies were analysed with the Mann-Kendall non-parametric test, as described in Sneyers (1990), to look for a
trend. The slopes of the trends were calculated by least square linear ﬁtting. The Mann-Kendall test was also used
for a progressive analysis of the series Sneyers (1990). The correlation between seasonal and yearly DTR and seasonal
and yearly precipitation and mean temperature was also performed. Some secular precipitation series were available
with daily resolution too. For these series the proportion of daily precipitation falling in 5 precipitation class intervals
was calculated for each year and each season. The resulting series were then analysed for trends, giving particular
emphasis to heavy and extreme events Brunetti et al. (2000c). The database resulting from the CNR Special Project
”Ricostruzione del clima dell’area mediterranea nel passato” should be extended to include more series and further
metadata. This extension is currently underway in the framework of the ”Progetto Finalizzato CLIMAGRI”. Other

extensions will be performed within the national research program ”Local climate variability in relation to global
climatic change phenomena”. Concerning precipitation, another database, covering a shorter period (1951-2000), but
having a higher spatial resolution, was considered; most of the series were extracted from the Italian Air Force (AM)
data set, and some others come from the Uﬃcio Centrale di Ecologia Agraria (UCEA), from the Uﬃcio Idrograﬁco (UI)
and from some research projects dealing with the recovery of single series. These series were homogenized, completed,
validated and grouped ﬁrstly into two areas (N and S), then in six more restricted areas by principal component analysis
Brunetti et al. (2001); the mean regional series and their anomalies were calculated for each area. The distribution
and the grouping of these stations are shown in ﬁgure 1. The completion of the series and the regional means were
performed by already known methods (Karl et al., 1995, 1998; Brunetti et al., 2001) and by a new method discussed
in Brunetti et al. (2002). This new method allows to obtain regional series suitable for the calculation of statistics
(e.g. drought lengths and frequencies) that can not be obtained using station records completed by methods based
on random generated data. For the 1951-2000 period, also monthly cloud cover series, extracted from the Italian Air
Force (AM) data set, were validated, homogenized and analysed for trends.

3. Results

3.1. Monthly series trends

As far as mean temperature is concerned, on a yearly basis there is a positive trend with a 0.99 signiﬁcance level (sl)
both for N and S; on a seasonal basis, considering a 0.99 sl, T has a positive trend in all four seasons in S, while in
N it has a positive trend in autumn, winter and, using a 0.95 sl, in spring. The T trends in the annual temperature
series, calculated by least squares linear ﬁtting, range from 0.4 C/100y for N to 0.7 C/100y for S. For the winter season
the slopes are greater, ranging from 0.7 C/100y (N) to 0.9 C/100y (S), while for the summer season they are lower
and in some cases not signiﬁcant. Even if the data set has been checked for homogeneity and some series have been
homogenised, trend estimates seem to be critically inﬂuenced by data homogeneity. The main problem is that data
homogenisation performed on a national basis hardly allows inhomogeneities due to changes in national standards to
be detected, as they concern most of the series in a rather short period. The question is still open, as more metadata
have to be recovered before giving a conclusive answer. The information available at present suggests that the principal
inhomogeneities seem to concern the end of the nineteenth century when in many observatories the meteorological
screens were moved from north facing windows to more open positions and the end of World War II. As discussed in

4

M. Brunetti et al.: Temperature, precipitation and extreme events during the last century in Italy

B¨ohm et al. (2001) the eﬀects of these inhomogeneities seem to cause an underestimation of temperature trends. The
progressive application of the Mann-Kendall test allows a more detailed analysis of the temperature series trends. A
complete discussion of this analysis is reported in Maugeri and Nanni (1998); the synthesis of the results is that both
for N and S the positive temperature trend seems to start around 1920. After 1920 the temperature rises rapidly till
1950, then it is more or less constant from 1950 to 1985, with only a slight drop in the period 1970-1980. After 1985
it begins to rise again in all seasons. Concerning DTR, the results of the analysis are discussed in detail in Brunetti
et al. (2000b). The results of the Mann-Kendall test indicate that DTR has a positive trend (sl > 95%) with the only
exception of winter in N (negative) and of spring and summer in S (not signiﬁcant). The increase in the annual DTR
in the period 1865-1996 is weak but signiﬁcant (0.22 C for N and 0.12 C for S) due to the stronger increase of Tmax
compared to Tmin. The comparison of these results with the literature shows that the Italian situation is anomalous,
because generally the DTR is characterised by a negative trend (Karl et al., 1993; Easterling et al., 1997). A detailed
comparison of the results for the period 1865-1996 is however hampered by the lack of literature data. A more detailed
analysis of the DTR series can be obtained with the progressive application of the Mann Kendall test. The results
indicate that in the last decades of the 19th century the DTR trend was generally negative. After the initial decrease,
in all the seasons (except winter) the DTR trend begins to increase from a date included in the period 1920-1940 for
N and in the period 1900-1920 for S. Then it continues to increase till around 1970 in N and around 1950 in S. In
the last decades the trends are generally constant in N, whereas in S they are constant in autumn and decreasing in
spring and in summer. In winter there is a tendency towards a negative trend in N and a positive one in S. As far as
precipitation is concerned, the series cover a longer period than for temperature. However, in order to allow a better
comparison, hereinafter the trend results are presented only for the common period. On a yearly basis a negative trend
(sl 0.99) is evident both for N and S; on a seasonal basis, there is a negative trend in spring, summer and autumn,
whereas in winter the trend is not signiﬁcant (S); or it is positive (N). The slopes of the P yearly series, calculated by
least squares linear ﬁtting, range between -104 mm/100 y for S and -47 mm/100 y for N, giving estimated decreases
in the period 1866-1995 of 135 and 61 mm. These values correspond, respectively, to 18% and 7% of S and N yearly
mean values. Both for N and S, spring and autumn have the steepest trends.

Italy (period 1867-1996) deﬁned by linear regression coeﬃcient (b) and associated error (σb). Bold numbers: signiﬁcance
level grater than 99%, italic numbers: signiﬁcance level grater than 95%.

In the same way as temperature series, also precipitation series were studied by means of the progressive application
of the Mann-Kendall test. A complete discussion of this analysis is reported in Buﬀoni et al. (1999); the most interesting
result regards P in S whose high signiﬁcant negative trend seems to be mainly caused by a strong precipitation decrease
in the last 50 years. All the trend results are summarized in table 2.

3.2. Relationships among monthly T, P and DTR

The comparison of the behaviour of T, P and DTR for the period 1865-1996 (ﬁgure 2) has been deeply analysed by
Brunetti et al. (2000b).

The correlation between yearly and seasonal DTR and P is always negative and highly signiﬁcant (> 99%) whereas
the correlation between DTR and T is positive (signiﬁcance > 95%) in spring and summer for N and in spring,
summer and autumn for S. The negative P - DTR correlation is more signiﬁcant in N than in S whereas the positive
T - DTR correlation is comparable in the two geographical areas. The correlation among T, P and DTR is mainly due
to high frequent variability, but the same behaviour that is present for the seasonal and yearly data is evident also on

longer time scales. Both the yearly and the secular correlated behaviours are probably caused by the same changes in
atmospheric circulation, with warm and dry conditions (high T and DTR, low P) being related to an increase of the
frequency of subtropical anticyclones over the western Mediterranean basin. These results are also supported by the
evolution of Italian total cloud amount in the 1951-1996 period, which is in very good agreement with the evolution
of the other parameters. By analysing the data of 35 stations we observed that there is a highly signiﬁcant negative
trend in yearly and seasonal average cloud amount all over Italy (Maugeri et al., 2001) (table 3). The slope is highest
in winter.

Table 3. Results of the application of the Mann-Kendall test and of least square linear ﬁtting to the regional and
subregional WD and PI series. In order to allow comparison between the diﬀerent data, the results are expressed
as ratios (in percentages) between the linear regression coeﬃcient and the mean values in the 1951-1996 period.
Bold numbers: signiﬁcance level greater than 95%; non-bold numbers: signiﬁcance level greater than 90%; when the
signiﬁcance level is lower than 90% only the sign of the slope is given.

3.3. Some results concerning daily precipitation series

An analysis of 67 sites over 46 years of daily precipitation records for Italy was undertaken by Brunetti et al. (2001) to
identify any changes in the characteristics of precipitation that may have occurred. The research concerned seasonal
and yearly precipitation, number of wet days (WDs) and precipitation intensity (PI), and consisted of studying the
trends both for the station records and for some diﬀerent area average series. PI was analysed both as amount of

6

precipitation per wet day and by attributing precipitation to 10 class-intervals (Osborn et al., 2000) removing the
inﬂuence of variations in the number of WDs to yield changes in the underlying shape of the WD amount distribution.

Fig. 3. Results of the application of the Mann-Kendall test and of least square linear ﬁtting to the regional (N and S)
10 class-interval annual contributions. The results are expressed as percentage variations compared to the mean value
over the 1951-1996 period. Black bins: signiﬁcance level greater than 95%; grey bins: signiﬁcance level greater than
90%.

Table 4. Annual and seasonal northern and southern Italy cloud amount trends. The results are expressed in oktas
in 50 years.

The principal results, summarized in ﬁgure 3 and table 4, are as follows:

i. The number of WDs in the year has a clear and highly signiﬁcant negative trend all over Italy. It depends mainly

on the winter, the season which accounts for about 50% of the N decrease, and about 75% of the S one.

ii. Besides the reduction in the number of WDs, there is a tendency towards an increase in PI. This increase is globally
less strong and signiﬁcant than the decrease in the number of WDs, and it is not concentrated in one speciﬁc season.
It is worth noticing that, in winter, the PI trend is positive, but very weak, in N and negative in S.

iii. In N, the increase in PI is mainly due to a strong increase in precipitation, falling into the highest class-interval,
whereas in S, it depends on a larger part of the WD amount distributions. As far as the lower part of the distribution
is considered, the situation is more similar, and both for N and S, the negative trend is best shown for the sum of
the three lower classes.

To search for a trend of dry periods in Italy for the last 50 years, Brunetti et al. (2002) proposed a new methods to
manage series with missing data without using random generated numbers and analysed the previous data set enlarged
to 75 stations and updated to 2000. The stations were clustered as already described for the previous database and
complete daily regional average series were obtained from the incomplete station records, and analysed for droughts.
Droughts were identiﬁed by means of 2 indicators: the longest dry period and the proportion of dry days. The most
remarkable result is a systematic increase in winter droughts over all of Italy, especially in the North, mainly due to
the very dry 1987-1993 period (ﬁgure 4).

over 1951-1980 and 1981-2000 (dashed lines) are shown too.

The reliability of the regional series was checked by computing some basic statistics concerning total precipitation,
rainy days and precipitation intensity and comparing them with the same statistics computed for regional series
obtained by station records completed with methods based on random number generators.

4. Conclusions

Globally, our results support the hypothesis we advanced in some previous papers (Brunetti et al., 2000a,b) and
conﬁrm that there are strong diﬀerences in the response to the recent global warming in Italy and other Central and
Northern European areas. In fact, besides some common features (temperature increase, tendency toward an increase
in precipitation intensity), there are other data (cloud cover, daily temperature range, number of wet days) that behave
conversely. All these diﬀerences are probably due to the strengthening in the North Atlantic Oscillation (Hurrell, 1995,
1996) that has accompanied the recent warming and that has caused an increase and a northerly shift in the westerlies,
with consequent advection of warm and moist air over large areas of Central and Northern Europe (Hurrell, 1995;
Jones et al., 1997), and more frequent anticyclones over its southern part (Rodwell et al., 1999).

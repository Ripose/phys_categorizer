Abstract. The problem of an electromagnetic wave scattered from a random
medium layer with rough boundaries is formulated using integral equations which
involve two kinds of Green functions. The ﬁrst one describes the wave scattered
by the random medium and the rough boundaries, and the second one which
corresponds to the unperturbed Green functions describes the scattering by an
homogeneous layer with the rough boundaries. As these equations are formally
similar to classical equations used in scattering theory by an inﬁnite random
medium, we will be able to apply standard procedures to calculate the coherent
ﬁeld. We will use the coherent potential approximation where the correlations
between the particles will be taken into account under the quasi-crystalline
approximation.

1. Introduction

Many studies on electromagnetic waves scattered by a random medium layer with
rough boundaries have been reported in recent years [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. Rigorous numerical methods have been developed [1, 2, 3] but
are computationally intensive or limited to 2D geometry. Most often, the radiative
transfer theory is used for the volumetric scattering with the Kirchoﬀ or small-
perturbation method for imposing the boundary conditions [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 16, 17].
This method is well suited to compute the scattered intensity but is based on
phenomenological considerations. Thus, analytical theory has been developed in order
to describe the coupling between the random medium and the rough boundaries.
Furutsu [13, 14] formulates the rough surface scattering problem with Dyson and
Bethe-Salpeter equations which permit treating the random medium and the rough
boundaries on the same footing. Unfortunately, this approach is formal, and the
relationship between the radiative transfer theory and the classical rough surface
scattering theories [17, 18, 19, 20, 21] is not straightforward. Mudaliar [10, 11, 12]
uses integral equations where the rough boundaries are treated under a perturbative
development. He shows that the intensity veriﬁes a ”generalized” transport equation.
If this approach is more numerically tractable than Furutsu’s, the expressions obtained
are still involved. This is due to the choice of perturbative development to describe
the scattering by the rough surfaces. In this paper, we show that we can obtain the
general expression, whatever the choice of the scattering theory used at the boundaries,
in introducing the scattering operators of the rough surfaces [21]. Furthermore, in
separating the surface and the volume scattering contributions with the help of Green
functions, we will be able to use well developed analytical theories of waves scattered
by an inﬁnite random medium [22, 16, 17, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28].
In this paper,
which is the ﬁrst part of a series of three papers, we investigate the coherent ﬁeld
scattered by the rough surfaces and the random medium. The contribution of the
random medium will be taken into account in introducing an eﬀective permittivity,
which is calculated under the Quasi-Crystalline Coherent Potential Approximation
(QC-CPA) [16, 17]. The contribution due to the rough surface will be given by the
average of the scattering operators [21]. The calculation of the incoherent ﬁelds will
be the subject of the following papers, where the derivation of the radiative transfer
equation will be detailed, and the particular case of strongly diﬀusing random media
will be treated using a vectorial diﬀusion approximation for Rayleigh scatterers.

2. Geometry of the problem and formulation

The geometry of the problem is shown in Figure 1. Volumes V0 and V2 are
homogeneous media with permittivity ǫ0(ω) and ǫ2(ω). For simplicity we suppose
that ǫ0(ω) is a real positive number. The random medium V1 is made of spherical
scatterers of permittivity ǫs(ω) in a background medium of permittivity ǫ1(ω). The
boundaries are described by the random functions z = h1(x) and z = −H + h2(x).

In the following, we consider harmonic waves with e−i ω t dependence. For a
point source located at r0 = x0 + z0 ˆez in the medium V0, the ﬁeld scattered by the
rough surfaces and the random medium at the point r = x + z ˆez in the media V0,

SV (r, r0, ω),
V1, V2 are, respectively, given by the dyadic Green functions [16, 29] G

by the layer with the rough boundaries but without the random medium. These
functions verify similar propagation equations and boundary conditions as the Green
aa0
SV (r, r0, ω), where the permittivity ǫV (r, ω) due to the random medium
functions G
is replaced by an eﬀective permittivity ǫe(ω) in equations (2, 17) and the permittivity
ǫ1(ω) is replaced by ǫe(ω) in equations (6, 11, 19, 23). This eﬀective permittivity will
be determined using the Coherent-Potential Approximation (CPA) with the Quasi-
Crystalline Approximation (QCA) [16, 17, 31, 32, 33]. We will show in Section 4
how to write these Green functions with the help of scattering operators, which are
common tools in scattering theory by rough surfaces [21].

3. Integral equations

A direct demonstration of these equations involves integral theorems [34], but it is
easier to invoke the uniqueness of the solution and verify a posteriori that the integral
equations (27-32) satisfy the propagation equations and the boundary conditions.
For example, to demonstrate that equation (17) is veriﬁed, we apply the operator
11
∇ × ∇ × −ǫe K 2

the deﬁnition in (33-35), we obtain

which is the propagation equation in (17). By using the same procedure, we show that
the propagation equations (1-3, 16-18) and the boundary conditions (7-9, 12-14) and
(20-22, 24-26) on the rough surfaces are satisﬁed. The boundary conditions at inﬁnity
aa0
in media 0 and 2 are speciﬁed by the choice of a retarded Green function for G
S .

However, due to the introduction of the eﬀective medium ǫe, the boundary conditions
(6, 11, 19, 23) are not satisﬁed, and we obtain the following boundary conditions:

11
SV (r, r0, ω) = ˆns1 · ǫ0(ω) G
11
SV (r, r0, ω) = ˆns2 · ǫ2(ω) G
We see that in the left-hand side of equations (36-39), the permittivity is not ǫ1(ω),
aa0
as it must be, but is ǫe(ω). If we had deﬁned the Green function G
describing the
S
scattering by a homogeneous medium (with rough boundaries) with the permittivity
ǫ1, the problem would not exist. But if we want to use the Coherent-Potential
Approximation, we must introduce this eﬀective permittivity. We might go around
aa0
this problem in changing the deﬁnition of the Green function G
S where a small
layer of arbitrary small thickness h with permittivity ǫ1 is added along the rough
boundaries. (See Figure (2).) These Green functions verify the boundary conditions
(6, 11, 19, 23) where the permittivity ǫ1 is not replaced by ǫe due to the added layers
along the boundaries. Therefore, with this deﬁnition, equations (27-32) verify the
boundary conditions (6, 11, 19, 23). However, the propagation equations (2, 17) are
not satisﬁed since the added layers produced new contributions. But as we can choose
the layers’ thickness as thin as we want, we can neglect the eﬀect of these layers on
the propagation equations. In the following, we won’t take care of these boundary
condition problems, and we will suppose that equations (27-32) are solutions of our
problem. The integral equations (27-32) are the key point of our approach. We see
that to calculate the ﬁeld in medium 0 or 2 (when the source is in medium 0) with
11
equations (27) and (29), we ﬁrst need to determine the Green function G
SV , where
the source and the receiver are in medium 1. This can be done with equation (31)
11
where the only unknown is G
SV . If the permittivities of the medium 0, 1, and 2 and
the eﬀective permittivity were equal (ǫe = ǫ0 = ǫ1 = ǫ2), which means that scattering
11
by the boundaries does not take place, the Green function G
S will be the Green

scattering theory by random media [17, 34, 35, 36].
In taking into account the
boundaries, we have to change this Green function for an inﬁnite random medium
by Green functions taking into account the scattering by the boundaries. However,
it is worth mentioning that the potential V
does not depend on the boundaries,
but only on the random medium. Because of this property, we will apply exactly the
same procedures developed in scattering theory by an inﬁnite random medium, where
the Green function for an unbounded medium must be replaced by Green functions
describing scattering by boundaries.

In this section, we show how to express the Green functions G
S with the help
of scattering operators which are common tools in scattering theory by rough
surfaces [21]. These operators describe the ﬁeld scattered by a rough surface
ab
illuminated by an incident plane wave. (The Green functions G
S describe the same
phenomenon for a spherical incident wave.) For a rough surface separating two semi-

It can be easily checked that the propagation equations (41) and (42) are satisﬁed
with the representations (51,53) and the deﬁnitions (55). To satisfy the transversality
conditions (44) and (45), we need to decompose the scattering operators R
(p|p0)
and T
(p|p0) on an orthogonal basis perpendicular to propagation vectors deﬁned
by p. These vectors are given by the following formula in medium 0 and 1 (Figure 4):

be negative or complex if the media are absorbing. Since the imaginary part of the permittivity is
always positive for an absorbing medium, we can use the following square root determination:

be invoked to justify the use of the scattering operator for −H + maxxh2(x) > z and

To determine, for example, the Green operator G

6. Ensemble average

In order to calculate the coherent ﬁeld reﬂected by the random slab, we need to
deﬁne the averaging procedure. Let < · · · >S and < · · · >V denote, respectively,
the ensemble average over the surfaces and the volume disorder. We also denote
≪ · · · ≫SV the average over the rough surfaces and the volume disorder. We suppose
that the rough surfaces and random medium properties are statistically independent,
which means that ≪ · · · ≫SV =< [< · · · >S] >V =< [< · · · >V ] >S. In the following
development, we won’t use any speciﬁc statistical properties of the rough surfaces
(except that < h1(x) >S=< h2(x) >S= 0); thus, we don’t need to specify them. An
extensive description can be found in the references [19, 43]. The ensemble average
over the random medium is deﬁned by

< f >V =

d3r1 . . . d3rN f (r1, . . . , rN ) p(r1, . . . , rN ) ,

(113)

ZV1

Electromagnetic wave scattering from a random layer with rough interfaces I

15

where r1, · · · , rN are the particles positions, and p(r1, . . . , rN ) is the probability
density function of ﬁnding the N particles at positions r1, · · · , rN . We will use a
decomposition of this density function with conditional probabilities [16, 17]:

p(r1, . . . , rN ) = p(ri)p(r1, · · · ,
p(r1, . . . , rN ) = p(ri)p(rj|ri)p(r1, · · · ,

ri, · · · rN |ri) ,
ri, · · ·

(114)
rj, · · · , rN |ri, rj) , (115)

indicates that the term is absent. The function p(ri) is the probability
where the hat
b
density function of ﬁnding a particle at ri, p(ri|rj) is the conditional probability of
ﬁnding a particle at ri given a particle at rj, etc.
If the particles are uniformly
distributed inside the random medium V1, then the single particle density function is
p(ri) = 1/V1, where V1 is the volume of the area V1. In this case, we also deﬁne a
pair-distribution function by

b

b

b

g(||ri − rj||) = p(ri|rj)/p(ri) ,

(116)

which depends only on the distance between the two particles if we suppose that
the distribution of the particles is statistically homogeneous and isotropic. The
normalization factor V1 is chosen in such a way that when the particles located at ri,
rj are far away from each over, their positions are uncorrelated (i.e., p(ri|rj) = p(ri)),
and we have

lim
||ri−rj ||→+∞

g(||ri − rj||) = 1 .

With these conditional probability functions, we deﬁne conditional averages:

7. Coherent potential approximation and eﬀective medium theory

b

b

Until now, we have not clariﬁed how to determine the eﬀective permittivity ǫe(ω).
To determine ǫe(ω), we use the fact that under some assumptions (mainly that the
eﬀective medium is not spatially dispersive [27] i.e., ǫ(ω, k) = ǫ(ω)), it can be shown,
using a diagrammatic technique, that the coherent part of the ﬁeld < E >V which
propagates inside an inﬁnite random medium behaves as a wave in an homogeneous
medium with a renormalized eﬀective permittivity [16, 17, 27, 28, 23, 44, 45]. In order
to insure this result in a self-consistent way, we introduce the Coherent Potential
Approximation (CPA), which postulates that [16, 17, 27, 31, 33]

This equation is in fact the deﬁnition of our eﬀective permittivity ǫe and is a
generalization of the classical (CPA) approach since we take into account the
boundaries in the Green function deﬁnitions. Using equation (100), we immediately
see that condition (121) is equivalent to

ǫe(ω) which takes place in the deﬁnition of V
S . Because the random medium
is made with spherical particles, it is convenient to express equation (123) as a function
of the scattering operator t11

The operator t11
ri describes the scattering process by a particle in an inﬁnite
homogenous medium (Figure 6). We must be careful in determining the permittivity
of this particle. In fact, as the propagator between two scattering events inside the
∞
particle is G
1 , the homogeneous medium surrounding the particle has the permittivity
(Appendix B). However, t11
ǫe due to the deﬁnition of G
ri doesn’t describe the
scattering by a particle of permittivity ǫs inside a medium of permittivity ǫe. If this
was correct, the operator v11
ri deﬁned by (125, 126) would contain the factor ǫs − ǫe
and not the factor ǫs − ǫ1. Thus, we have to renormalize the particle permittivity in
introducing ˜ǫs = ǫs − (ǫ1 − ǫe), such as

ri (r) = K 2

Hence, the operator t11

11
permittivity ǫ1, the operators W
SV would have been zero operators (since
ǫe(ω) = ǫ1(ω) in the deﬁnition (130, 132) give null contributions), and the iteration of
equation (139) show us the multiple scattering process inside the slab [27, 45]:

As was demonstrated by Lax [46], this approximation is strictly valid when the
particles have a ﬁxed position, as in a crystal. The quasi-crystalline approximation is
equivalent to neglect of the ﬂuctuation of the eﬀective ﬁeld, acting on a particle located
at rj, due to a deviation of a particle located at ri from its average position. Under

In doing this, we neglect all the boundary eﬀects in the calculation of the eﬀective
permittivity ǫe, and equations obtained are the same used to calculate the eﬀective
permittivity in an inﬁnite random medium [16, 17, 33]. In an inﬁnite medium, we can
use the Fourier transform to write the equation (175), which is deﬁned by

f (k|k0) =

d3r d3r0 exp(−ik · r + ik0 · r0) f (r, r0) .

In the Fourier space, the translational invariance of the inﬁnite medium implied the
following property of the scattering operators t11

t11

where t11
ri=0(k|k0) is the scattering operator for a particle located at the

(175), we show that < C

However, this result is greatly improved under the (CPA-QCA) approach since for

(179, 180), which is a generalization of the usual Maxwell-Garnett formula [16, 17, 48,
49, 50]. One can also obtain an approximate formula for the eﬀective permittivity,
which at the same time contained the Maxwell-Garnett formula and the Keller

Few approximate theories give explicit expression for the scattering operators (192)
for a slab. Most of them use the small-perturbation theory [52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57]
to derive some approximate expression of S
, but the perturbative development
needs to go up to the second order to take into account the roughness of the surfaces.
We must also mention that the Kirchhoﬀ theory in the geometrical optics limit and
the full-wave method have been extended for a slab with rough boundaries [58, 59].
However, we know that for the coherent part of the scattered ﬁeld, the exponential
term present in the Kirchhoﬀ theory gives an accurate description even in the small-
perturbation limit [60]. Thus, under the Kirchhoﬀ theory (or the ﬁrst term of Small-
Slope Approximation, which gives the same results [21]), we have for Gaussian rough
surfaces [21, 16, 17],

(See
In comparing expression (214) and (218), we see that
references [16, 17, 52, 53].)
the rough surfaces modify the reﬂection coeﬃcients for a planar slab by adding new
factors [c1],[c2],[c3]. The random medium doesn’t change the form of the reﬂection
coeﬃcients but only the permittivity ǫ1 of the initial medium by an eﬀective one ǫe.
Furthermore, if the random medium is highly scattering and thick, the imaginary part
of the eﬀective permittivity ǫe is important, and the factor exp(2 i αe(p0) H) in the
expression (208) of [rH 21] is very small. The contribution [rH 21] in equation (218)
becomes negligible compared to [r10(p0)], and we have

permittivity ǫ0 and ǫe.
In this case, the lower boundary doesn’t contribute to the
coherent ﬁeld.

10. Conclusion

We have considered the scattering of an electromagnetic wave by a random medium
with rough boundaries. We have formulated the solution of this problem using two
kinds of Green functions. The ﬁrst one describes the scattering by the rough surfaces
and the random medium, and the other represents the scattering by an homogeneous
slab with rough boundaries. As equations obtained are similar to those used in
scattering theory by an inﬁnite random medium, we were able to introduce the
coherent potential with the quasi-crystalline approximation to calculate the eﬀect of
the random medium on the coherent ﬁeld. With this approach, the random medium
contribution is taken into account by an eﬀective medium permittivity. The surface
scattering contributions on the coherent ﬁeld are included in the scattering operator
of the system, which describes the scattering by the rough boundaries. This operator
can be approximated using the usual scattering theories by rough surface like the
small-perturbation, the Kirchhoﬀ, or other more sophisticated theories. To derive
these results, we have supposed that the slab is suﬃciently thick to insure, for one
hand, that their exist a layer (−H + maxxh2(x) < z < minxh1(x)) between the two
rough boundaries which contains the scatterers, and in second hand, that the eﬀective
permittivity ǫe(ω) doesn’t not depend on the boundaries (K ′′

e H ≫ 1).

In the following papers, we will use our Green function formulation of the
scattering problem to derive a radiative transfer equation describing the scattered
incoherent intensity. Furthermore, we will investigate the case of an highly scattering
medium where a vectorial diﬀusion approximation permits simplifying the radiative
transfer equation.

For spherical scatterer, an exact expression of this operator is well-known and given
by the Mie theory [47, 64, 66, 65]. In comparing equations (B.15) and (B.18), we have
the following relationship between f (ˆk|ˆk0) and t11

4π f (ˆk|ˆk0) = (I − ˆkˆk) · t11

o (k|k0) :
o (k|k0) · (I − ˆk0 ˆk0) ,

(B.19)

where k = Kb ˆk, and k0 = Kb ˆk0. The operator t11
o (k|k0) is a generalization of the
scattering amplitude f (ˆk|ˆk0) since it contains also the near-ﬁeld component scattered
by the particle. Furthermore, we see that the far-ﬁeld component is obtained in
taking only the transversal components of t11
o (k|k0) (due to the projectors I − kk and
I − k0k0) and using an on-shell approximation (since k · k = k0 · k0 = Kb).

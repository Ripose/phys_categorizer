Abstract Results from a GPS reﬂectometry experiment with a 12 channel
ground-based GPS receiver above two lakes in the Bavarian Alps are presented.
The receiver measures in open-loop mode the coarse/aquisition code correlation
function of the direct and the reﬂected signal of one GPS satellite simultaneously.
The interference between the coherently reﬂected signal and a model signal,
which is phase-locked to the direct signal, causes variations in the amplitude
of the in-phase and quad-phase components of the correlation sums. From
these amplitude variations the relative altimetric height is determined within a
precision of 2 cm.

1 Introduction

Satellite-based active altimeters on ENVISAT and JASON deliver valuable
ocean height data sets for global climate modelling. In order to improve the
climate models, altimetric data of higher resolution in space and time is re-
quired. This gap can potentially be ﬁlled with GPS-based altimetric measure-
ments. Additionally, ground-based GPS receivers can monitor ocean heights in
coastal areas where satellite altimetry data get coarse and decrease in quality
(Fu and Cazenave, 2001; Shum et al., 1997).

Since GPS altimetry has been proposed as a novel remote sensing capability
(Mart´ın-Neira, 1993), many studies have been carried out at diﬀerent obser-
vation heights and platforms. While Earth-reﬂected GPS signals have been
observed from spaceborne instruments (Lowe et al., 2002a; Beyerle et al., 2002)
and the CHAMP and SAC-C satellites already are equipped with Earth/nadir
looking GPS antennas, work is in progress in order to establish satellite-based
GPS altimetry (Hajj and Zuﬀada, 2003). Airborne campaigns have been con-
ducted (e.g. Garrison et al. (1998), Garrison and Katzberg (2000), Rius et al.
(2002)) and recently reached a 5-cm height precision (Lowe et al., 2002b). Ground-
based GPS altimetry measurements have been performed at laboratory scale of
some meters height with 1-cm height precision (Mart´ın-Neira et al., 2002) up
to low-altitudes height (e.g. Anderson (2000), Mart´ın-Neira et al. (2001)) and
reached a 2-cm height precision (Treuhaft et al., 2001).

In this study a 12 channel GPS receiver is used (Kelley et al., 2002), that
has been extended with a coarse/acquisition (C/A) code correlation function
tracking mode. In this coherent delay mapping (CDM) mode the direct GPS
signal is tracked while concurrently the reﬂected signal is registered in open-loop
mode. Using the L1 carrier phase the relative altimetric height is determined
from the components of the reﬂected signal.

2 Experimental Setup and Data Acquisition

The experiment was conducted on 8 - 10 July 2003, 50 km south of Munich,
Germany, in the Bavarian alpine upland at the mountain top of Fahrenberg
(47.61◦N, 11.32◦E) at a height of about 1625 m asl. Mount Fahrenberg belongs
to the Karvendel mountains and from the mountain top unobstructed view is
available to lake Kochelsee (surface area about 6 km2) to the north and lake
Walchensee (surface area about 16 km2) to the south. Following a schedule of
predicted GPS reﬂection events, the receiver antenna was turned towards the
lake surface of Kochelsee (about 599 m asl) or Walchensee (about 801 m asl).
The antenna was tilted about 45◦ towards the horizon. During a GPS reﬂection
event the direct and the reﬂected signals interfere at the antenna center (e.g.
Parkinson and Spilker (1996)). The interference causes amplitude ﬂuctuations
that are quantitatively analyzed to determine the height variation of the specular
reﬂection point.

The receiver is based on the OpenSource GPS design (Kelley et al., 2002)
and was modiﬁed to allow for open-loop tracking of reﬂected signals. The receiv-
ing antenna is an active RHCP patch antenna (AT575-70C from AeroAntenna
Technology Inc.) with 4 dBic gain, 54 mm in diameter and a hemispheric
ﬁeld-of-view. Operating in CDM mode all 12 correlator channels are tuned to
the same GPS satellite by setting the appropriate pseudo-random noise (PRN)
value. The correlation between the received and model (replica) signal is re-
alized in hardware (Zarlink GP2021, ZARLINK (2001)). While one channel
(the master channel) continues to track the direct signal, the carrier and code
tracking loops of the 11 remaining channels (slave channels) are synchronized to
the master channel. Each channel consists of the prompt and the early tracking
arm at zero and at -0.5 chip code delay, respectively. Thus, 2 × 11 = 22 delays
are available to map the C/A code correlation function of the reﬂection signa-
ture. In CDM mode the slave carrier and code phase-locked loops (PLLs) are
opened and their loop feed-back is obtained from the master PLL. All carrier
loops operate with zero carrier phase oﬀset with respect to the master chan-
nel; in the code loop feed-back, however, delays covering an interval of 2 chips
(about 2 µs) with a step size of 0.1 chips (about 100 ns) are inserted. In-phase
and quad-phase correlation-sums of each channel are summed over 20 ms taking
into account the navigation bit boundaries and stored together with code and
carrier phases to hard disk at a rate of 50 Hz. Figure 2 illustrates the CDM
mode: while the direct GPS signal is tracked with the prompt and early arm of
the master channel at 0 and -0.5 chips code oﬀset, the prompt and early arms of

2

the remaining 11 slave channels are set to chip code oﬀsets between 0.4 and 2.7
to map the reﬂected signal (corresponding to an optical path diﬀerence of 120
to 810 m). In Figure 2 the root-sum-squared in-phase and quad-phase values
of the reﬂected signal are plotted as a function of code delay. The maximum
power of the reﬂected signal is about 20 log 0.2 = −14 dB below the direct sig-
nal’s power. The peak of the correlation function is separated by a delay of 1.5
chips from the direct signal’s correlation peak.

Data analysis is performed in the following way: ﬁrst, the code delay cor-
responding to the maximum of the reﬂected waveform is determined. Second,
all in-phase and quad-phase correlation sum values Ir and Qr are extracted
from the raw data which lie within a certain delay interval (grey box in Figure
2) around the maximum code delay. The navigation message is demodulated
according to

˜Ir = sign(Id) Ir
˜Qr = sign(Id) Qr,

where Id denotes the in-phase value of the master channel. Figure 3 A shows the
oscillations of ˜Ir and ˜Qr caused by the interference between the reﬂected and
the replica GPS signal. The phasor ˜Ir + i ˜Qr rotates by about + 0.5 Hz due to
the decreasing path length diﬀerence between the direct and the reﬂected signal,
since during this measurement the GPS satellite moved towards the horizont.
Note the phase oﬀset of 90◦ between ˜Ir and ˜Qr. The phase φ (Fig. 3 B) is
calculated from the four quadrant arctangent

φ = atan2( ˜Qr, ˜Ir)

and is unwrapped by adding ± 2π when the diﬀerence between consecutive val-
ues exceeds π, resulting in the accumulated phase φa. The optical path length
diﬀerence δ between direct and reﬂected signal is calculated from the accumu-
lated phase φa and the L1 carrier wavelength λL1 = 0.1903 m at the observation
time t

Starting with a height estimate H(t0), the temporal evolution of the altimetric
height variation h(t) − h(t0), normal to the tangent plane at the reﬂection point
P, is calculated from (Treuhaft et al., 2001)

assuming an inﬁnite distance to the GPS transmitter. ǫeph is calculated from
the broadcast ephemeris data (GPS SPS, 1995), the correction ∆ǫtropo accounts
for refraction caused by atmospheric refractivity. The tropospheric correction
is derived from a geometric raytracing calculation using a refractivity proﬁle
obtained from meteorological analyse provided by the European Centre for
Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. The position of the specular reﬂection point
P as function of γ (Figure 1) is calculated following Mart´ın-Neira (1993).

Thus, the altimetric height change of the GPS receiver above the reﬂecting
surface is determined from the carrier phase diﬀerence between the direct and
reﬂected GPS signal (Figure 3 C).

3 Data Analysis and Discussion

During all 3 days several reﬂection events were observed from both lake sur-
faces with diﬀerent GPS satellites at elevation angles between about 10◦ - 15◦,
indicated by a clearly visible waveform (see Figure 2). Several outliers can be
observed in the data records. Most likely they are caused by overheating of the
hardware correlator chip [S. Esterhuizen, University of Colorado, personal com-
munication, 2003]. In this study outliers are removed in the following way: a
value is calculated by linear extrapolation from the last 3 values of ˜Ir(t). If the
diﬀerence between extrapolated and actual value exceeds a threshold (20000-
22000), the extrapolated value is taken. The same is applied to the ˜Qr(t) data.
Additionally cycle slips (sporadic height jumps of about λL1 m in adjacent data
points) can be observed in the optical path length diﬀerence δ(t). The distor-
tion of the data by cycle slips could be minimized by applying the same method
as above to δ(t). Continuous data segments without cycle slips are chosen for
height change determination. The mean receiver height above the lake surface
is not expected to change during the short analyzed time periods. From to-
pographic maps (scale 1:25000, Bayerisches Landesvermessungsamt, 1987) the
heights H(t0) are estimated to be 1026 m ± 5 m (Kochelsee) and 824 m ± 5 m
(Walchensee), respectively. By minimization of the linear trend of h(t) − h(t0)
we obtain a H(t0) of 1022.5 m (Kochelsee) and 827.5 m (Walchensee).

Figure 4 A and B plot the relative height change between the receiver and
the reﬂection point at the surface of lake Kochelsee. Both observations used
the same PRN, but were taken on diﬀerent days. The height varies within an
interval of about ± 5 cm with a standard deviation of about 3.1 and 2.6 cm.
Figure 4 C and D show the height changes between the receiver and the reﬂection
point at the surface of lake Walchensee. Again both observations were taken
on diﬀerent days and used diﬀerent PRNs. Compared to the Kochelsee data,
the height varies within a height interval of about ± 2.5 cm with a standard
deviation of about 1.4 and 1.7 cm.

The diﬀerent height variations at both lakes can be explained by diﬀerent
local wind and wave height conditions. As lake Walchensee is completely sur-
rounded by mountains, waves are mainly driven by local, thermal induced winds
which mainly occur at noon. Lake Kochelsee is open to the north, so longer

4

lasting wind can build up waves on the lake surface.

4 Conclusions and Outlook

Open-loop tracking of the reﬂected signals allows the determination of the rel-
ative altimetric height with 2-cm precision. Diﬀerent height changes can be ob-
served at Kochelsee and Walchensee which reﬂect the diﬀerent wind and wave
height conditions at the two lakes. The relationship between the observed height
changes and wind speed (e.g. Caparrini and Martin-Neira (1998), Lin et al.
(1999), Komjathy et al. (2000), Zuﬀada et al. (2003), Cardellach et al. (2003))
will be subject of further studies. The present receiver implementation is lim-
ited to the observation of one GPS satellite at a time. To fully use the potential
of GPS reﬂections the receiver will be modiﬁed to keep track of several GPS
reﬂections simultaneously.

Our results suggest that open-loop tracking is possible with low-gain and
wide ﬁeld-of-view antennas, showing the potential of this method also for space-
based measurements of GPS reﬂections.

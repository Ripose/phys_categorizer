ABSTRACT

We present new optical turbulence structure parameter measurements, C2
n, over sea water between La Parguera
and Magueyes Island (17.6N 67W) on the southwest coast of Puerto Rico. The 600 meter horizontal paths were
located approximately 1.5 m and 10 m above sea level. No data of this type has ever been made available in the
literature. Based on the data, we show that the C2
n measurements are about 7 times less compared to equivalent
land data. This strong evidence reinforces our previous argument1–4 that humidity must be accounted for to
better ascertain the near surface atmospheric turbulence eﬀects, which current visible / near infrared C2
n bulk
models fail to do. We also explore the generalised fractal dimension of this littoral data and compare it to our
reference land data. We ﬁnd cases that exhibit monofractal characteristics, that is to say, the eﬀect of rising
temperatures during the daylight hours upon turbulence are counterbalanced by humidity, leading to a single
characteristic scale for the measurements. In other words, signiﬁcant moisture changes in the measurement
volume cancels optical turbulence increases due to temperature rises.

1. INTRODUCTION

Bulk climate models estimating and forcasting optical atmospheric turbulence eﬀects are based on the structure
parameter (or “constant”) of temperature

T = 1.6ǫθǫ−1/3
C2
wherein ǫθ is the rate of temperature variance dissipation through ﬂuid viscosity (assumed passive additive)
and ǫ is the rate of energy dissipation. ǫ is related to the characteristic turbulence mixing length scale L and
the energy E by the Kolmogorov dimensional approximation

Gladstone’s law then leads to

The problem with Eq. 1 is the assumption that the temperature variance θ is a passive additive. This is false
in general since buoyancy forces, which are associated with temperature inhomogeneities, are being ignored.
Neither is there a direct reference to humidity, although that eﬀect is implicit in the deﬁnition of C2
T . To better
deﬁne the formalism, we have to ﬁnd an expression for C2
T in terms of macroscopic variables only. Masciadri et
al.5 found the following expression for the temperature structure parameter

where θ refers to the virtual potential temperature, z is the altitude, L is a vertical mixing length for a parcel of
air driven by turbulent forces and φ3 is a dimensionless number similar to an inverse Prandtl number. Obviously,
in order to include the macroscopic eﬀects of buoyancy, moisture and general vertical mixing, φ3 has to be well
deﬁned. This is what we seek to do in the marine environment, which motivates our eﬀort in obtaining C2
n path
integrated measurements in the visible/near infrared (our instruments’ transmitter LEDs are centered on 0.9
µm, and the detector bandwidth is between 0.65 µm to 1 µm) at two altitudes.

The objective of the experimental conﬁguration, shown in Figure 1 was to provide a comparison of the path
integrated C2
n at two diﬀerent altitudes within the surface layer over water with data previously recorded over
a land bound site4, 6, 7 (between February and April 2006, the run is designated “Φr”); all of the measurements
were carried out along the west coast of Puerto Rico (sited approximately at 18N 67W). Two OSI LOA-004

scintillometers3 and two Davis Provantage Plus (DP+) weather stations were sited between the University of
Puerto Rico’s Magueyes Island Research facility and a private site on the coastal section of the town of La
Parguera, Lajas. For ease of reference, this campaign is designated HOPA VIPh (HOrizontal PAth propagation
from the VIlla Parguera hotel). As illustrated, two beam paths were deﬁned: scintillometer 1 (beam 1) was
located between the rooftops of buildings, such that approximately 14% of the optical path length crossed over
land, while scintillometer 2 (beam 2) was conﬁgured to record a pure over water path between jettys. Both
scintillometer sample rates were set to 0.1Hz. The altitude of beam 1 varied from 6 to 15 m end–to–end, with
a path length of 580 m, while that of beam 2 was a constant 1.5 m above the sea surface, with a path length
of 592 m. The DP+ weather stations were closely located with the receiver heads of each instrument. Figure 2
show photographs of the instrument installations.

The experimental campaign was carried out over 3 weeks between 20 August and 5 September of 2006,

corresponding to year days 232 through to 248.

seen next to the receiver head.

3. DISCUSSION OF DATA

We obtained 14 datasets (spanning a full 24 hour period) per scintillometer. Beam 1, at a mean height of 10
m above sea level, provided 5 sets with 95% or higher valid data. In the case of the near sea–surface beam 2,
only 3 sets were totally free from data dropouts, mostly arising from wind misalignments. It is probable that
human activity (primarily boats near the beam) aﬀected the full range of records, given that the beam path
crossed a public marine space. These show themselves as strong data spikes, but in the absence of independent
conﬁrmation for each event we have not attempted to ﬁlter them. In ﬁgure 3 we present the 14 complete 24
hour datasets. Note that while the two beams do track each other quite well, the lower altitude measurements
show more spread around the daylight hours than the higher altitude. We attribute this to human activity since
there does not seem to a regular overall pattern. Most notable in the data is the partial or complete suppression
of the daytime ‘D’ curve in the C2

n data.

By way of comparison, in ﬁgure 4, we present a subset of the Φr landbound record measured with the same
instruments. The Φr conﬁguration diﬀered in path length from that of HOPA VIPh; it was much shorter, at
90 m between transmitter and receiver. In this run, the scintillometers were placed side by side, at the same
altitude. While we do not claim that it is valid to undertake a direct comparison of all the moments of the
landbound ensemble with HOPA VIPh, it is certainly reasonable to examine the diﬀerence between means. The
mean value for Φr’s path integrated C2

n is approximately 6.6 times larger than that of HOPA VIPh.

between transmitter and receiver. The ordinates are at the same scale as Figure 3.

4. FRACTAL ANALYSIS

In order for the C2
n measurements presented in Section 3 to be easily compared to future data under diﬀerent
conditions, we have begun a preliminary study of the dimensional (fractal) structure of the temporal distribution.
The idea that optical turbulence potentially has a fractal structure is not new. In fact Schwartz et al. identiﬁed
that Kolmogorov turbulence degraded wavefronts resemble a fractional Brownian motion fractal surface.8

Determination of fractal dimensions from experimental data is not a straightforward process, due to the
many sources of error introduced by the ﬁniteness of datasets involved9 and the ﬁnite range of length scales
inherent therein. Borgani et al.10 surveyed the most popular methods for determining fractal dimensions: gen-
eralized correlation integrals, box counting methods, density reconstruction procedures and minimal spanning
tree algorithms. Their conclusion is that nearest neighbour and minimal spanning tree methods fail to accu-
rately gauge the fractal dimensions, principally because they discard information about the inter–point distance.
Of the remaining three options, box counting was found to be very similar to correlation integrals; since box
counting is anisotropic (therefore very slow), we discard them from our consideration here.

It turns out that correlation integrals are most reliable for generalised fractal dimensions, Dq, of positive
In contrast, the density reconstruction procedure is reliable for
order, and less reliable for negative order.
negative order and less so for positive order. Negative order fractal dimensions measure the “emptiness” of a
distribution, while positive order dimensions measure the space (or time in our case) ﬁlling of a distribution.
We are interested in the measure of (time) ﬁlling, so we have made use of the correlation integral procedure,
due to Pawelzik and Schuster.11

4.1. CORRELATION INTEGRAL ESTIMATES OF FRACTAL DIMENSION

Before detailing the results of our preliminary ﬁndings, we review the ideas behind the correlation integral.
Given a ﬁnite set of N data points xi sampled from some distribution, the correlation functions Ci(t) are
deﬁned to be the fraction of points within time interval t of the ith data point. The partition function

Z(t, q) =

Ci(t)q−1

N

N

Xi=1

(5)

is then expected to scale as rτ over the range of length scales where fractal (self similar) properties hold. If we
ﬁt a power law to Z(t, q) then we can ﬁnd the generalised fractal dimension Dq through

τ = (q − 1)Dq

(6)

For example, the Hausdorﬀ dimension is estimated if q = 0, the information dimension is estimated if q → 1 and
the correlation dimension is from q = 2. We note here that the estimation of the q = 0 dimension is extremely
sensitive to regions of low point density (data dropouts) so although we list it in what follows, it is probably
unwise to regard it as a “safe” universal measure. From the data shown in Table 1, we can discern the accuracy

Table 1. Generalised fractal dimensions of HOPA VIPh datasets. This is compared with an equivalent Φr run, in italics.
The dimension were calculated for data that had been smoothed with a 60 point forward moving boxcar. Beam 1 is the
high altitude beam, beam 2 is the low altitude beam. On the last line of the table, we present the estimated generalised
dimensions for a 64 point theoretical pure fractal of dimension 1.0000.

of the correlation integral algorithm from the results of applying it to a reference 64 point fractal of dimension
1.0000. D0,1,2,4 lie no more than 1.55% from the true dimensional value, and their mean varies from 1.0000
by 0.6%. The C2
n data series themselves have 8640 points (assuming no data gaps), so we anticipate that the
estimation accuracy will be no worse than the reference values.

If we examine the variance from the dimensional mean of each of the datasets shown, the 08/24/06 and
08/25/06 sets from the low altitude beam exhibit monofractal characteristics (mean dimensions of 0.99 and 0.96
respectively, with diﬀerences with respect to the mean of no more than 2%), while the rest are multifractal. We
expect that fully developed turbulence will be concentrated on a multifractal set: the fact that we see a possible
monofractal set implies that those data possess a global dilatation invariance, regardless of solar insolation.

We claim that injection of moisture into the measurement volume for optical turbulence dampens out the
temperature eﬀect; this result occurs for the 1.5 m altitude beam but from our preliminary calculations, seems
not to occur in the 10 m beam.

5. CONCLUSIONS

We have presented C2
n data acquired at two altitudes, 1.5 m and approximately 10 m, above the sea surface in
the tropical littoral environment of La Parguera, Lajas, Puerto Rico over a 0.6 km pathlength. In comparison
to 90 m landbound measurements, we note the suppresion of increased turbulent activity due to elevated
temperatures when the sun is up. We also found that the mean value of C2
n is some 6.6 times less for the
marine measurement ensemble compared to the landbound readings, strongly indicating that moisture plays
an equivalently strong role to temperature in determining C2
n. Finally we have presented initial estimates for
the general fractal dimensions Dq, obtained with the correlation integral method due to Pawelzik and Schuster.
This shows that the data taken very close to the surface of the sea can behave as a monofractal, therefore
indicating that humidity plays a very signiﬁcant part in countering the eﬀect of rising temperature during the

daylight hours upon optical turbulence. It may be possible to formulate this in terms of a detailed balance (in
wavenumber space) between input and output energy at only one scale for these cases.

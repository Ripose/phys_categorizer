The Quest for the Neutrino Mass Spectrum

H.V. Klapdor–Kleingrothaus, H. P¨as

1. Introduction

Recently the particle physics community was shocked with breathtaking
news from the neutrino sector: Neutrino oscillations have been conﬁrmed
ﬁnally in the Super-Kamiokande [1] experiment. Now for the ﬁrst time, on-
going and future experiments in neutrino oscillations (Super-Kamiokande,
Borexino, SNO, MINOS, KAMLAND, MINIBOONE,...) and double beta
decay (Heidelberg–Moscow, GENIUS,...)
together can aim to solve the
neutrino mass puzzle.

It was in 1930, when Wolfgang Pauli (ﬁg. 1) wrote his famous letter
adressed as Liebe radioaktive Damen und Herren (Dear radioactive Ladies
and Gentlemen), where he informed the participants of a nuclear physics
workshop in T¨ubingen about his absence (he preferred to participate in a
dance party) and postulated the neutrino to solve the problem of energy
nonconservation in the nuclear beta decay. In 1956 the neutrino was ob-
served for the ﬁrst time by Clyde Cowan and Fred Reines in Los Alamos,
who originally planned to explode a nuclear bomb for their experiment
[2]. Finally, two years ago, the Super-Kamiokande experiment, a 50,000
ton water tank viewed by more than 11,000 photo multipliers 1,000 meter
underground below a holy mountain in Japan, announced a signiﬁcant sig-
nal for neutrino oscillations and established a non-vanishing mass of the
neutrino as the ﬁrst experimental signal of physics beyond the standard
model. However, in spite of these successes, entering a new millenium the
neutrino is still the most mysterious of the known particles. Alternatingly
compared with spaceships travelling through the universe, ghosts penetrat-
ing solid rocks and vampires missing a mirror image [3], it still inspires the
phantasy of hundreds of adventurous particle, nuclear and astro physicists
being motivated by the hope, the neutrino could act as a key to the old hu-
man dream of a ﬁnal theory, describing all particles and forces in a uniﬁed
framework, and to a deeper understanding of the fate of the universe.

The attributes, making the neutrino this kind of outlaw among the

known particles, are the following:

Figure 1. The man who proposed it and an impression of its potential
cosmological consequences: Wolfgang Pauli (nobel prize 1945, left panel
[4]) ﬁrst thought about a neutral light particle being emitted in nuclear beta
decays. Clouds of interstellar gas (right panel [5]) act as a birthplace for
new stars. Neutrinos may be important for the formation of structure in
the early universe.

• The neutrino seems to possess an at least million times smaller mass
than the lightest of the remaining particles, the electron. While in the
standard model the neutrino was introduced as massless “by hand”,
this feature is especially problematic in uniﬁed theories, where the
common treatment of neutrinos and charged fermions in extended
multiplets implies them to have (Dirac) mass terms of the same order
of magnitude as the other fermions.

• Among all fundamental fermions the neutrino is the only one being
electrically uncharged. Thus the neutrino interacts a billion times less
often than an electron and may penetrate the entire earth without
even be deviated. This is the reason why neutrinos, in spite of their
tiny masses, may be that abundant that they contribute substantially
to the mass of the universe, about twenty times more than the mass
of all visible stars in the sky, and may inﬂuence the evolution of the
universe, e.g. the growth of structures, in a signiﬁcant way.

The basis for an understanding of these features relates them to each
other and was proposed in 1933 by the Italian theoretician Ettore Majo-
rana [6], one year before he dissappeared under mysterious circumstances.
Majorana found out that neutrinos, due to their neutral charge, can be
identical with their antiparticles, triggered by a new, so-called Majorana

2

mass term ∗. In 1979 T. Yanagida and independently Murray Gell-Mann
(nobel prize 1969), P. Ramond and R. Slansky found out that these ad-
ditional Majorana mass terms may cancel almost totally the usual Dirac
mass terms in the so-called “see-saw mechanism” [7], yielding a natural
explanation of the tiny neutrino masses. This would require the existence
of right-handed heavy neutrinos as they are naturally predicted in “left-
right-symmetric” uniﬁed models. † The exact value of the mass then is
correlated with a higher energy scale predicted by the underlying uniﬁed
gauge group, and oﬀers one of the rare possibilities to test these theories,
since most of the predictions are observable only at very high energies,
which are lying beyond the reach of present and future accelerators (see
ﬁg. 2). The question to experimentalists thus remains: What is the mass
of the neutrino? The following review will outline the way to answer this
question, concentrating on two experimental approaches, yielding the com-
plementary pieces to solve the puzzle: Only both neutrino oscillations and
neutrinoless double beta decay together could solve this absolute neutrino
mass problem.

2. Neutrino oscillations

The fact that neutrinos are massive has ﬁnally been established by neutrino
oscillation experiments. Neutrino oscillations are a quantum mechanical
process based on mixing between the three neutrino ﬂavors, which is possi-
ble if the ﬂavor (interaction) eigenstates να do not coincide with the mass
eigenstates νi. The ﬂavor eigenstates are thus given by a superposition of
the mass eigenstates:

να =

3

X

i=1

Uαiνi

(1)

In that case a neutrino, which is emitted as a ﬂavor eigenstate να in a weak
reaction, propagates as a superposition of the three mass eigenstates. If
these mass eigenstates are non-degenerate, they travel with diﬀerent veloc-
ities and the composition in eq. (1) is getting out of phase. With a proba-
i − m2
bility, which is a function of the mass squared diﬀerences ∆m2 = m2
j
and the mixing Uαi, after a certain distance the neutrino interacts as a
diﬀerent mass eigenstate νβ6=α (see ﬁg. 3). Obviously neutrino oscillation
experiments cannot give any information about the absolute mass scale in

∗ In fact also pure usual “Dirac” mass terms for the neutrino are possible but are

disfavored in most fundamental theories.

† Alternative mechanisms motivate neutrino masses at the weak scale, a famous
example is R-parity violating supersymmetry, see e.g.
[8], where neutrino masses pro-
vide a window into deep relations of particles and forces. Also gravity induced non-
renormalizable mass terms can play a role in string-motivated scenarios, see e.g.
[9].

Figure 2. The light neutrino mass can be related to a corresponding large
mass scale in uniﬁed theories, e.g.
in the see-saw mechanism. This way
the hunt for neutrino masses oﬀers a unique possibility to access physics
at energy scales beyond the reach of running and future accelerators, which
has been realized only shortly after the big bang. A neutrino mass of 0.1
eV - 0.001 eV corresponds, via the mass of its heavy right-handed partner,
to energies of 1010 GeV or more, tiny fractions of a second after the big
bang (background from [10]).

the neutrino sector, but yield informations about mass (squared) diﬀer-
ences, only. Since the probability oscillates with the propagation distance,
this phenomenon, which was predicted by Bruno Pontecorvo, after he dis-
appeared in 1950 from England and later showed up again in Russia, is
called neutrino oscillations [11].

Up to now, hints for neutrino oscillations have been observed in solar
and atmospheric neutrinos as well as the accelerator experiment LSND (for
an overview see ﬁg. 4). ‡

• A deﬁcit of the number of solar neutrinos [12] being expected has
been conﬁrmed in many experiments [13] after the pioneering Chlor
experiment [14] of Ray Davis in the Homestake mine. The oscillation
§ may be in-
mechanism of the solar νe in (as normally assumed) νµ
duced via two diﬀerent mechanisms. The usual neutrino oscillation
mechanism requires maximal mixing and suﬀers from the fact, that
for this case the distance earth-sun has to be ﬁnetuned (vacuum os-
cillations). An alternative solution has been suggested by works of
S. Mikheyev, Alexei Smirnov and L. Wolfenstein [15]: Resonant con-
versions, which are triggered by matter eﬀects in the solar interior
implying a level crossing of mass eigenstates, can cause the neutrino
deﬁcit. In this case both small as well as large mixing are allowed.
The diﬀerent solutions of the solar neutrino experiments correspond
to diﬀerent combinations of mass squared diﬀerences ∆m2
12 and mix-
ing matrix elements U 2
12. They will be tested by ongoing and future
experiments such as Super-Kamiokande, SNO and BOREXINO [18]
in the next years ¶. Vacuum oscillations should lead to seasonal
variations, the small mixing MSW solutions should imply distortions

‡ It should be stressed that besides neutrino oscillations also new interactions beyond

the standard model may provide solutions to some of the neutrino anomalies, see [17]

§ An alternative would be a fourth sterile νs, see section 7
¶ If one allows for larger conﬁdence belts a third MSW “LOW” solution appears,
which can be tested via its strong day-night eﬀect at low neutrino energies, observable
at BOREXINO, LENS and the double beta and dark matter detector GENIUS (see
below) [19].

Figure 4. Summary of neutrino anomalies. The solar neutrino deﬁcit can
be solved within the light blue regions of the small mixing and large mixing
MSW oscillations, and the vacuum oscillations (at ∆m2 ∼ 10−9 − 10−10
eV2, not shown in the ﬁgure). Only the large MSW solution is directly
testable by KAMLAND. In the atmospheric favored region (light green)
νµ − νe oscillations are excluded by CHOOZ. The K2K and MINOS exper-
iments will test for νµ → ντ oscillations. The favored region of LSND is
shown in light blue and can be tested in part by KARMEN and in total by
MINIBOONE. Also shown is the sensitivity of GENIUS 1 ton and GENIUS
10 t or comparable double beta decay projects to νe → νµ,τ,s oscillations.
The lines correspond to (from above) mνe/mνµ,τ,s = ∞, 0.01, 0.1, 0.5 (back-
ground from [27]).

of the energy spectrum and the large mixing angle solution should
show a small spectral distortion, a day-night eﬀect of the total rate
and a disappearance signal in the long baseline reactor experiment
KAMLAND [21] just under construction.

• A similar eﬀect has been observed in atmospheric neutrinos [20],
which stem from the decay of the pions produced from cosmic ray
interactions in the upper atmosphere and the following-up decays.
Here Super-Kamiokande obtained a high precision result of a deﬁcit
of muon neutrinos compared to electron neutrinos. Even more con-
vincing is the distortion observed for the zenith angle dependence of
the muon neutrino ﬂux, which provides a strong hint for νµ → ντ
oscillations with maximal mixing and information about ∆m2
23 and
U 2
23 [1]. Future long baseline experiments, K2K (already running),
MINOS, and CERN-Gran Sasso [21], looking for oscillations in ac-
celerator produced neutrino beams over distances of several hundred
kilometers will provide a check of this result by directly looking for ντ
appearance and have the possibility to search for small contributions
of νe → ντ oscillations.

• Also an accelerator experiment, LSND, has reported evidence for
νe − νµ neutrino oscillations. However, this evidence is generally
understood as the most ambiguous. The KARMEN experiment has
excluded a large part of the favored region of LSND. Since only two
experimental evidences may be ﬁtted with only three neutrinos. the
LSND result would require the existence of a fourth, sterile (i.e. not
weakly interacting) neutrino (see section 7). A decisive test will be
obtained from the MINIBOONE experiment [16].

3. Neutrinoless double beta decay

Double beta decay (0νββ) corresponds to two single beta decays occurring
in one nucleus and converts a nucleus (Z,A) into a nucleus (Z+2,A) (see
ﬁg. 3). While the standard model (SM) allowed process emitting two
antineutrinos

A

Z X →A

Z+2 X + 2e− + 2νe

(2)

is the rarest process observed in nature with half lives in the region of
1021−24 years, more interesting is the search for the lepton number violating
and thus SM forbidden neutrinoless mode,

A

Z X →A

Z+2 X + 2e−

(3)

which has been proposed by W.H. Furry in 1939 [22]. In this case the neu-
trino is exchanged between the vertices (see ﬁg. 3), a process being only

7

allowed if the intermediate neutrino has a Majorana mass. Neutrinoless
double beta decay, when observed, also does not measure directly the neu-
trino mass. Since the neutrino in the propagator is only virtual, it does not
have a deﬁnite mass. Propagating in the nucleus is the ﬂavor eigenstate
with the so-called eﬀective neutrino Majorana mass

(4)

which is a function of the mixing angles Uej, complex phases φj , which allow
for cancellations of the entering masses, and the neutrino mass eigenvalues.
This quantity has exciting connections to the observables in neutrino oscil-
lation experiments. The most stringent limit on this quantity, hmi < 0.35
eV, is obtained by the Heidelberg–Moscow experiment [23], which was ini-
tiated by one of the authors [24] and is running since 10 years in the Gran
Sasso underground laboratory in Italy. An impressive breakthrough to
10−2 − 10−3 eV could be obtained realizing the GENIUS project proposed
in 1997 [25], a further proposal of H.V. Klapdor-Kleingrothaus, operating
1-10 tons of enriched Germanium directly in a tank of 12 m diameter and
height ﬁlled with liquid nitrogen.

How are the results in double beta decay and neutrino oscillations re-
lated? In a recent work [26] the authors of this article in collaboration
with Alexei Smirnov from the ICTP Trieste were studying the relations
of the neutrino oscillation parameters and the eﬀective Majorana mass in
the several possible neutrino mass scenarios and settled the conditions un-
der which the neutrino mass spectrum can be reconstructed with future
projects (see ﬁg. 5). In the following we will concentrate on three extreme
cases as examples, the hierarchical spectrum, the degenerate scheme and
the inverse hierarchical scheme.

4. Hierarchical schemes

Hierarchical spectra (ﬁg. 6)

m1 ≪ m2 ≪ m3

(5)

can be motivated by analogies with the quark sector and the simplest see-
saw models. In these models the contribution of m1 to the double beta
decay observable hmi is small. The main contribution is obtained from m2
or m3, depending on the solution of the solar neutrino deﬁcit.

If the small mixing angle solution is realized in solar neutrinos (i.e. small
νe − νµ mixing), the contribution of m2 is small due to the small admixture
Ue2. The same is true for vacuum oscillations, where Ue2 is maximal but

by the nuclear reactor experiment CHOOZ [29], implying hmi < 2 · 10−3
eV in the range favored by atmospheric neutrinos. Obviously in this case
only the 10 ton GENIUS experiment could observe a positive 0νββ decay
signal. A coincidence of such a measurement with a signal of νe → ντ
oscillations at MINOS and a conﬁrmation of solar vacuum or small mixing
MSW oscillations by solar neutrino experiments would be a strong hint for
this scheme.

If the large mixing solution of the solar neutrino deﬁcit is realized, the
contribution of m2 becomes large due to the almost maximal Ue2, now.

asymmetries. A coincident measurement of hmi ≃ 10−3 eV, a day-night
asymmetry of 0.07 at future oscillation experiments and a conﬁrmation of
the large mixing angle solution by KAMLAND would identify a single point
in the large mixing angle MSW solution (in this example near the present
best-ﬁt point) and provide a strong hint for this scheme.

5. Degenerate schemes

Degenerate schemes (ﬁg. 9)

require a more general (and more complicated) form of the see-saw mech-
anism [30]. One of their motivations is also, that a large overall mass scale
allows neutrinos to be cosmologically signiﬁcant. Neutrinos with an overall
mass scale of a few eV could play an important role as “hot dark mat-
ter” component of the universe. When structures were formed in the early
universe, overdense regions of (cold) dark matter provide the seeds of the
large scale structure, which later formed galaxies and clusters. A small
“hot” (relativistic) component could prevent an overproduction of struc-
ture at small scales. Since structures redshift photons, this should imply
also imprints on the cosmic microwave background (CMB), which could be
measured by the future satellite experiments MAP and Planck [31].

In degenerate schemes the mass diﬀerences are not signiﬁcant. Since
the contribution of m3 is strongly bounded by CHOOZ again, the main
contributions to hmi come from m1 and m2. The relative contributions
of these states depend on their admixture of the electron ﬂavor, which is
determined by the solution of the solar neutrino deﬁcit.

Figure 10. Double beta decay oberservable hmi and oscillations parameters:
The case for degenerate neutrinos. Plotted on the axes are the overall scale
of neutrino masses m0 and the mixing sin2 2θ12. Allowed values for hmi
for a given m0 correspond to the regions between m0 and the correspond-
ing curved line. Also shown are informations which could be obtained from
cosmological ﬁts (see text) and the expected sensitivity of the satellite ex-
periments MAP and Planck. A value of hmi = 0.1 eV in the case of small
solar neutrino mixing would be in the range to be explored by MAP and
Planck [26].

In ﬁg. 10 lines of constant double beta decay observables (solid curved
lines) are shown together with information from cosmological observations
about the overall mass scale (horizontal lines). Shown are best ﬁts to the
CMB and the large scale structure of Galaxy surveys in diﬀerent cosmolog-
ical models as well as the sensitivity of MAP and Planck. E.g., a ΛCHDM
model with a total Ωm = 0.5 of both cold and hot dark matter as well as
a cosmological constant, and a Hubble constant of h = 0.6 would imply an
overall mass scale of about 0.5 eV. However, the contributions of diﬀerent
mass eigenstates are in the same order of magnitude and may cancel, now.
Assuming a mixing corresponding to the best ﬁt of solar large mixing MSW
or vacuum oscillations this yields hmi = 0.2−0.5 eV, just in the range of the
recent half life limit of the Heidelberg–Moscow experiment. If even larger
mixing turns out to be realized in the solution of the solar neutrino deﬁcit,

archy. Shown is the example with large solar neutrino mixing.

this allows for a larger cancellation. A coincidence of the absolute mass
scale reconstructed from double beta decay and neutrino oscillations with
a direct measurement of the neutrino mass in tritium beta decay spectra
or its derivation from cosmological parameters determined from the CMB
in the satellite experiments MAP and Planck would prove this scheme to
be realized in nature. To establish this triple evidence however is diﬃcult
due to the restricted sensitivity of the latter approaches. Future tritium
experiments aim at a sensitivity down to O(0.1 eV) and MAP and Planck
have been estimated to be sensitive to P mν = 0.5 − 0.25 eV. Thus for
neutrino mass scales below m0 < 0.1 eV only a range for the absolute mass
scale can be ﬁxed by solar neutrino experiments and double beta decay.

6. Inverse Hierarchy

A further possibility is an inverse hierarchical spectrum (ﬁg. 11)

m3 ≃ m2 ≫ m1

(7)

where the heaviest state with mass m3 is mainly the electron neutrino,
now.

Its mass is mainly determined by the atmospheric neutrinos, m3 ≃
∆m23. Thus for the case of the small mixing angle solution one gets a
unique prediction of hmi = (5 − 8) · 10−2 eV, which could be tested by the
1 ton version of GENIUS. For the vacuum or large mixing MSW solution
cancellations of the two heavy states become possible and hmi < 8 · 10−2
eV. A test of the inverse hierarchy is possible in matter eﬀects of neutrino
oscillations. For this case the MSW level crossing happens for antiparti-
cles rather than for particles. Eﬀects could be observable in long baseline
experiments and in the neutrino spectra of supernovae [32].

7. Four neutrinos

Sterile neutrinos, which do not couple to the weak interactions, can easily
be motivated in superstring inspired models: multidimensional candidates
for a ﬁnal “Theory of Everything”, in which the fundamental constituents
of matter have a string rather than a particle character. Such theories
could accomodate for additional neutrinos in diﬀerent ways. Examples are
extended gauge groups, fermions living in extra (compactiﬁed) dimensions
as well as a mirror world, which contains a complete duplicate of matter
and forces building the universe, interacting only via gravity. In the latter
case hmi = 0.002 eV is predicted [33].

If the four neutrinos are arranged as two pairs of degenerate states
(mainly νe − νs for solar and νµ − ντ for atmospheric neutrinos) separated
by a LSND gap, all three neutrino anomalies can be solved and the two
heavy states can account for the hot dark matter. The main contribution to
hmi comes from the heavy states, then, and can be derived from the LSND
result. Depending on the phase of these two contributions hmi can be as
large as O(10−3 eV). A strong hint for the scheme would be a coincidence
of the ∆m2 favored in LSND and possibly MINIBOONE, cosmological
observations and double beta decay, together with the discovery of sterile
neutrinos in solar neutrino oscillations by SNO.

8. Summary

The recent years brought exciting developments in neutrino physics. Neu-
trino oscillations have ﬁnally been conﬁrmed in atmospheric neutrinos and
at the same time double beta decay experiments realized for the ﬁrst time
a sensitivity, leading to strong implications on the neutrino mass spectrum
and cosmological parameters. After this particle physics now seems to enter
its “neutrino epoche”: The neutrino mass spectrum and its absolute mass

scale oﬀer unique possibilities to provide crucial information for cosmology
and theories beyond the standard model. Only both neutrino oscillations
and neutrinoless double beta decay together have the chance to solve this
neutrino mass problem (see also, e.g.
[34]) and to set the absolute scale
in the neutrino sector: If the solution of the solar neutrino deﬁcit and the
character of hierarchy (direct or inverse) is determined in neutrino oscilla-
tion experiments, the following informations will be obtained from a future
double beta decay project:

For the case of direct/normal hierarchy, a conﬁrmation of the small
mixing MSW solution would mean: If double beta decay would be measured
with hmi > 0.1 eV this would establish a degenerate spectrum with a ﬁxed
mass scale. If hmi is measured in the range (0.5 − 3) · 10−2 eV a partially
degenerate spectrum, m1 ≃ m2 ≪ m3, with ﬁxed mass scale is realized in
nature. For hmi < 2 · 10−3 eV a hierarchical spectrum exists in nature.
For the large mixing MSW solution a value of hmi > 3 · 10−2 eV implies
a degenerate spectrum with a region for the mass scale determined by
the solar mixing angle. For hmi < 2 · 10−2 eV a partially degenerate or
hierarchical spectrum is realized in nature and a region for the mass scale
If hmi < 2 · 10−3 eV is measured the
is set by the solar mixing angle.
spectrum is hierarchical. If vacuum oscillations are the correct solution for
the solar neutrino deﬁcit a value of hmi > 3 · 10−2 eV implies degeneracy,
hmi > 2 · 10−3 eV partial degeneracy and hmi < 2 · 10−3 eV hierarchy, but
no information about the absolute mass scale is obtained.

For the case of inverse hierarchy the situation is more predictive. For the
small mixing angle MSW solution hmi ≡ (5 − 8) · 10−2 eV is expected. For
large mixing angle MSW or vacuum oscillations one awaits hmi < 8 · 10−2,
above this value the scheme approaches the degenerate case.

In four neutrino schemes hmi can be as large as O(10−3) eV. A conin-
cidence of a double beta decay signal with the ∆m2 favored in LSND and
possibly in MINIBOONE, an imprint of neutrinos as hot dark matter in
the CMB as well as the discovery of sterile neutrinos in SNO would prove
the scheme and ﬁx the mass scale.

This outcome will be a large step both towards the understanding of
the evolution of the universe and towards the dream of a uniﬁed theoretical
description of nature. We are entering an exciting decade!

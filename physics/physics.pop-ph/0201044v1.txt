How Is Nature Asymmetric ?

2. CP and T Violation in Elementary Particle
Physics

B. Ananthanarayan, J. Meeraa, Bharti Sharma,
Seema Sharma and Ritesh K. Singh

This two-part article considers certain fundamen-
tal symmetries of nature, namely the discrete
symmetries of parity (P), charge conjugation (C)
and time reversal (T), and their possible viola-
tion. Recent experimental results are discussed
in some depth. In this second part, we discus-
sion CP and T violation and arrive at a synthesis.

In this second part we discuss the violation of two dis-
crete symmetries, CP and T , which follows our discus-
sion in general of the discrete symmetries C, P and T ,
and that of parity violation in the ﬁrst part. We con-
clude with a synthesis of the ideas presented in the two
parts of this article.

CP-invariance

In the weak interactions, P and C are maximally vio-
lated simultaneously, such that the system is symmetric
under the combined operation of CP . This is clear from
the way massless fermions transform under P and C op-
erations (Fig. 1).

In nature only left-handed neutrino (νL) and right-handed
anti-neutrino (¯νR) exist, which are CP transforms of
each other. Hence, earlier it was thought that though
weak interactions violate P and C they still possess CP -
symmetry.

In 1964, Christenson, Cronin, Fitch and Turlay observed
that decay of neutral kaon violates CP -symmetry minutely.

and they decay primarily to two-pion and three-pion ﬁ-
nal states via the weak interaction with two diﬀerent
life-times. Based on the life-times of decays in to these
modes, kaons were renamed as K-short (τ = 0.89
×
10−10sec) and K-long (τ = 5.17
10−8sec). By conser-
vation of angular momentum and intrinsic parity of pion,

it is clear that the two-pion state,

to two (three)-pion or CP -even (odd) state, and CP is
conserved. But it was observed that KL also de-
cays into two-pions, which is CP -even and hence
CP is violated.

If we take a beam of K 0, which is produced by strong
interactions, and which can be written as linear super-
position of KL and KS, then the two-pion decay mode of
KL will interfere with that of KS as a function of time.

a physical system by writing down certain of its characteristics

This interference was observed by Christenson et. al.
in 1964. Similar to η+−, we can deﬁne another quantity,
η00, which is ratio of amplitudes of decay in to π0π0 in-
stead of π+π−. Nonvanishing of the η’s implies that CP
is violated. Further η’s are written as,

η+− = ǫ + ǫ′

η00 = ǫ

and CP violation is generally expressed in terms of ǫ
and ǫ′. Experimental values of these parameters are :

A non-zero value of ǫ′ is referred to as direct CP viola-
tion. In the Standard Model (SM) (see Box 2) the quan-
tity ǫ′ is somewhat smaller as compared to the experi-
mental values. But due to large calculational and exper-
imental uncertainties, the SM predictions are not ruled
out. Other place to see CP violation is the B-meson
system, which is similar to the K- meson system, with
the s-quark replaced by a b-quark.
In SM the source
of CP violation is Cabibbo Kobayashi Maskawa matrix
(Box 2). The CP violation eﬀect in K must translate to
B-mesons also. At several particle physics laboratories,

4

“asymmetric colliders” have been constructed to study
the B0

¯B0 system (see Box 3).

−

Further, according to CP T -theorem, CP violation im-
plies T violation, but there is no direct evidence for it
in neutral kaon system. Thus the source of CP viola-
tion is not yet clear and the phenomenon needs better
understanding as it may have been responsible for the
net baryon number of the present day Universe (Box 4).

T reversal violation

Soon after the discovery of parity violation in experi-
ments following the suggestions of Yang and Lee, many
authors considered the possibility of violation of the
other discrete symmetries we have discussed earlier. The
great Russian physicist L. D. Landau considered the pos-
sibility of elementary particles possessing a non-vanishing
electric dipole moment (e.d.m.) which would imply the
violation ofT-reversal invariance. Note however that a
complex system like a water molecule does possess an
e.d.m., but this does not come into conﬂict with T-
reversal invariance. There are many atomic systems in
which the e.d.m.s of elementary particles such as neu-
trons or electrons can manifest themselves. However,
these e.d.m.s appear to be very small quantities and
there has been no detection of such eﬀects. This implies
that experiments must seek higher levels of precision
before they can announce a discovery, and it also im-
plies that theoretical scenarios which predict large val-
ues of e.d.m.s can be constrained or ruled out by the
non-observation of e.d.m.s. (The Standard Model of the
electroweak interaction gives a contribution to the neu-
tron e.d.m. of the order of 10−31 to 10−33 e cm which, be-
cause it is second order in the weak interaction coupling
constant, is very small.) Here we discuss one speciﬁc
technique based on so-called ultra-cold neutrons, which
is implemented at Rutherford Appleton Laboratories.
Nuclear reactors serve as copious sources of neutrons

5

which are used for a variety of experiments. Normally
these neutrons emerge with a kinetic energy of about
1/40 eV, and are called thermal neutrons. In order to
carry out very precise measurements of static and other
properties of neutrons, it is necessary to slow them down
to very low kinetic energies of the order 10−7 eV or even
less. Such neutrons are called ultra-cold neutrons and
provide an opportunity to carry out highly precise ex-
periments.

“The Ramsey resonance technique” can be used to mea-
sure with very high precision the precession frequency of
ultracold neutrons in a weak magnetic ﬁeld. The preces-
sion frequency will change in the presence of an electric
ﬁeld if the neutron has an e.d.m. The most recent re-
10−26 e cm.
sult give an upper bound of the order of dn ≤
Synthesis

In this two part article we have discussed the origins
of the important discrete symmetries, C, P , T and CP ,
which are at the heart of the nature of space and time.
In particular, the fundamental interactions between el-
ementary particles and the mediators of forces between
them must either respect these symmetries or violate
them in a speciﬁc manner, but without coming in con-
ﬂict with the CP T theorem, a rigorous consequence of
the special theory of relativity. Of special interest are
current and ongoing experiments that verify and con-
strain theories of these interactions at an ever increasing
level of precision. Among these is the violation of P by
the weak-interactions, which has recently been detected
in a low-energy but high precision experiment involving
the nuclear anapole moment. The violation of CP in
the B-meson system is only the second example of such
a phenomenon discovered in current experiments. The
detection of direct T violation is an ongoing experimen-
tal challenge in such settings as the ultra-cold neutron
facilities. CP violation is also crucial for the rise of

6

baryon asymmetry from a baryon symmetric Universe
in the standard big-bang cosmology. In this brief arti-
cle, we have examined and summarized all the aspects
mentioned above of a fascinating and challenging aspect
of the physical world in which we live.

Box 1 : Superposition principle of Quantum Me-
chanics

One of the postulates of Quantum Mechanics (QM) which
makes it diﬀerent form classical mechanics is the prin-
ciple of superposition of quantum states. The state of
the system is described by a wave function, say ψ, which
satisﬁes Schr¨odinger equation

2 ψ(x, t) + V (x)ψ(x, t)

where V (x) is potential. The probability of ﬁnding the
2dx and
system between x and x+dx at time t is
hence ψ is also called probability amplitude. The super-
position principle states that under logical OR operation
its the amplitudes which adds and not the probabilities.
For example,
if two possible solutions of Schr¨odinger
equation are ψ1 and ψ2 then probability of ﬁnding the
system between x and x + dx at time t in either of the
2+
two states is

Box 2: The Standard Model of Electroweak and
Strong interactions

Based on decades of experiments in the ﬁeld of elemen-
tary particle physics, today a picture which is referred to
as the Standard Model of interactions has come into be-
ing. It describes the interactions between several types
of particles, which come in two varieties. The ﬁrst vari-
ety are called leptons, which participate only in the elec-
troweak interactions and not in the strong interactions,
and the second variety are called hadrons which partic-
ipate in both. For example, the electron and its neu-
trino are leptons. They have heavier cousins called the
muons and τ leptons and their respective neutrinos. The
hadrons themselves come in two classes, namely mesons
and baryons. Among mesons we ﬁnd the pions, kaons
and the B-mesons, whereas the proton and neutron are
examples of baryons. These are understood in the SM to
be arising from the interactions of further constituents
called quarks, which themselves come in six “ﬂavors,”
the up, down, strange, charm, bottom and top quarks.
These particles typically carry electric charge as do the
charged leptons and also additional quantum numbers
called colors through which they interact amongst them-
selves with the exchange of so-called gluons which me-
diate the strong interactions. The electroweak forces

8

themselves are mediated by the well-known photon and
other particles called W ± and Z.

The SM, as proposed by Glashow, Weinberg and Salam,
had only ﬁrst four ﬂavors of quarks and possesses CP
symmetry. To explain CP violation in K-meson system
two more quarks namely b and t were introduced.
In
SM, the source of CP violation is mixing between quarks
which is described by Cabbibo-Kobayashi- Maskawa (CKM)
matrix. The matrix elements of the relevent 2
2 sub-
matrix are real if we have only four ﬂavors of quarks
and this implies that CP is a good symmetry. CP will
be violated only if some of the CKM matrix elements
are complex, which is possible when we have at least six
quarks in nature (details are beyond the scope of this
article). The present day SM contains six quarks and
can accomodate CP violation in K and B meson sys-
tems.

Box 3: The “Asymmetric” B-factory.

Conventional cyclotron design of elementary particle col-
liders consists of a ring in which a beam of particles
of a certain type, say electrons (protons),
is acceler-
ated in one sense, while the anti-particles, say positrons
(anti-protons) are accelerated in the opposite sense in
the same ring, which is guaranteed by the fact that the
particle and anti-particle diﬀer only in the sign of their
electric charge, while their masses are equal. Many suc-
cessful experiments for generations were based on this
design, the latest include the Large Electron Positron
collider at CERN, which will be upgraded to the Large
Hadron Collider. However, the B-factories are based on
a novel design which was forced upon by the limitation
of technology which required that the B-mesons should
travel a distance larger than the spatial resolution of
the silicon vertex detectors that are used. The asym-
metric design uses one of the fundamental implications
of Einstein’s special theory of relativity, which is that

9

of time-dilation as follows: the electron beam energy is
signiﬁcantly larger than that of the positron beam, each
of which is now accelerated in diﬀerent rings and then
brought together to a central detector region. The asym-
metry of the energies ensures that the decay products
are now boosted in the laboratory frame and therefore
the particles generated “live longer” and traverse a dis-
tance that is large enough for the detectors to resolve.
As a concrete example, we consider the BELLE experi-
ment at Japan’s KEK laboratory. Here the electron en-
ergy corresponds to Ee = 8GeV , (where the GeV unit
corresponds roughly to the energy that would be gener-
ated if a proton were to be converted into energy), while
the positron energy corresponds to Ee = 3.5GeV . This
corresponds to β = v/c = 0.391, which is the boost ve-
locity of the reaction products in the laboratory frame in
units of the velocity of light and γ = 1/√1
β2 = 1.18,
the time dilation factor (or the reciprocal of theLorentz-
Fitzgerald contraction factor). The life-time of the B-
10−12 sec, which implies that in a sym-
meson is 1.55
metric collider it would have only traversed 35 µm, while
in BELLE it traverses 290 µm, while the silicon vertex
detector resolution corresponds to 50 µm. We thus illus-
trate with this example the interplay of the special the-
ory of relativity, the needs of elementary particle physics
research and present day technology.

Box 4: CP violation and the early Universe

The currently accepted picture of the origin of the Uni-
verse is often referred to as the Big Bang picture. The
Big Bang out of which the known Universe is supposed
to have arisen is based on solutions of Einstein’s equa-
tions of Genreral Relativity which correspond to an ex-
panding, homogeneous and isotropic Universe, and which
accounts for the recession of galaxies governed by Hub-
ble’s law, and for the nearly homogeneous cosmic mi-
crowave background radiation corresponding to a black
body temperature of 2.7 K. In our Universe, we observe

10

•

•

•

more matter than anti-matter (“baryon asymmetry”).
One may pose a question as to whether in the Big Bang
epoch this was the case. The well-known Russian physi-
cist Andrei Sakharov answered this question as follows:
a baryon symmetric Universe at the time of the big bang
could have evolved into an asymmetric one if three con-
ditions were necessarily met.

there must be interactions present which violate
baryon number in the ﬁrst place,

that the Universe be out of thermal equilibrium,
and

that CP be violated.

In this manner CP violation could possibly hold one of
the keys to the origin of the matter-antimatter asymme-
try in the Universe as we know it. In fact, one of the
reasons cited for the award of the Nobel prize to Fitch
and Cronin is the connection of CP violation to this fea-
ture of the Universe.

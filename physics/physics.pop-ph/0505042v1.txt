Abstract

“No one has ever touched Zeno without refuting him”. We will not refute Zeno
in this paper. Instead we review some unexpected encounters of Zeno with modern
science. The paper begins with a brief biography of Zeno of Elea followed by his famous
paradoxes of motion. Reﬂections on continuity of space and time lead us to Banach
and Tarski and to their celebrated paradox, which is in fact not a paradox at all but
a strict mathematical theorem, although very counterintuitive. Quantum mechanics
brings another ﬂavour in Zeno paradoxes. Quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno eﬀects are
really paradoxical but now experimental facts. Then we discuss supertasks and bifur-
cated supertasks. The concept of localization leads us to Newton and Wigner and to
interesting phenomenon of quantum revivals. At last we note that the paradoxical idea
of timeless universe, defended by Zeno and Parmenides at ancient times, is still alive
in quantum gravity. The list of references that follows is necessarily incomplete but we
hope it will assist interested reader to ﬁll in details.

1 Introduction

Concepts of localization, motion and change seems so familiar to our classical intuition:
everything happens in some place and everything moves from one place to another in ev-
eryday life. Nevertheless it becomes a rather thorny issue then subjected to critical analysis
as witnessed long ago by Zeno’s paradoxes of motion. One can superﬁcially think that the
resolution of the paradoxes was provided by calculus centuries ago by pointing out now the
trivial fact that an inﬁnite series can have a ﬁnite sum. But on the second thought we
realize that this ”resolution” assumes inﬁnite divisibility of space and time and we still do
not know whether the physical reality still corresponds to the continuous space and time
at very small (Plankian) scales. Even in pure mathematics the inﬁnite divisibility leads
to paradoxical results like Banach-Tarski paradox which are hard to swallow despite their
irrefutable mathematical correctness.

More subtle under the surface truth about Zeno’s paradoxes is that even if one assumes
the inﬁnitely divisible space and time calculus does not really resolves the paradoxes but
instead makes them even more paradoxical and leads to conclusion that things cannot be
localized arbitrarily sharply. Of course the latter is just what we expect from basic principles
of quantum mechanics and special relativity. But it is certainly amazing to ﬁnd roots of
these pillars of the modern physics at Zeno’s times!

2 Zeno of Elea

“No one has ever touched Zeno without refuting him, and every century thinks it worthwhile
to refute him” [1]. Therefore it seems that refuting Zeno is eternal and unchanging aﬀair in
complete accord with the Eleatic philosophy. According to this philosophy all appearances
of multiplicity, change, and motion are mere illusions. Interestingly the foundation of the
Eleatic philosophical school was preceded by turbulent events in drastic contrast with its
teaching of the unique, eternal, and unchanging universe [2]. The school was founded by
Xenophanes (born circa 570 BC), a wandering exile from his native city of Colophone in
Ionia. Before ﬁnally joining the colony at Elea, he lived in Sicily and then in Catana.
The Elea colony itself was founded by a group of Ionian Greeks which seize the site from
the native Oenotrians. Earlier these Ionian Greeks were expelled from their native city of
Phocaea by an invading Persian army. Having lost their homes, they sailed to the Corsica
island and invaded it after a awful sea battle with the Carthaginians and Etruscans, just
to drive once again into the sea as refugees after ten years later (in 545 BC) their rivals
regained the island. We can just wonder about psychological inﬂuence of these events on
the Eleatic school’s belief in permanent and unalterable universe[2].

Zeno himself had experienced all treacherous vicissitudes of life. Diogenes Laertius de-

scribes him [3] as the very courageous man:

“He, wishing to put an end to the power of Nearches, the tyrant (some, however, call
the tyrant Diomedon), was arrested, as we are informed by Heraclides, in his abridgment of
Satyrus. And when he was examined, as to his accomplices, and as to the arms which he
was taking to Lipara, he named all the friends of the tyrant as his accomplices, wishing to
make him feel himself alone. And then, after he had mentioned some names, he said that
he wished to whisper something privately to the tyrant; and when he came near him he bit
him, and would not leave his hold till he was stabbed. And the same thing happened to
Aristogiton, the tyrant slayer. But Demetrius, in his treatise on People of the same Name,
says that it was his nose that he bit oﬀ.

Moreover, Antisthenes, in his Successions, says that after he had given him information
against his friends, he was asked by the tyrant if there was any one else. And he replied,
”Yes, you, the destruction of the city.” And that he also said to the bystanders, ”I marvel
at your cowardice, if you submit to be slaves to the tyrant out of fear of such pains as I
am now enduring.” And at last he bit oﬀ his tongue and spit it at him; and the citizens
immediately rushed forward, and slew the tyrant with stones. And this is the account that
is given by almost every one”.

Although this account of Zeno’s heroic deeds and torture at the hands of the tyrant is
generally considered as unreliable [4, 5, 6], Zeno after all is famous not for his brevity but
for his paradoxes [7, 8, 9, 10, 11].

3 Zeno’s paradoxes of motion

Zeno was a disciple of Parmenides, the most illustrious representative of the Eleatic philos-
ophy. According to Parmenides, many things taken for granted, such as motion, change,
and plurality, are simply illusions and the reality is in fact an absolute, unchanging oneness.
Of course, nothing contradicts more to our common sense experience than this belief. It is

2

not surprising, therefore, that Parmenides’ views were ridiculed by contemporaries (and not
only). In his “youthful eﬀort” Zeno elaborated a number of paradoxes in order to defend the
system of Parmenides and attack the common conceptions of things. The four most famous
of these paradoxes deny the reality of motion. The Dichotomy paradox, for example, states
that it is impossible to cover any distance [2]:

•

There is no motion, because that which is moved must arrive at the middle before it
arrives at the end, and so on ad inﬁnitum.

According to Simplicius, Diogenes the Cynic after hearing this argument from Zeno’s
followers silently stood up and walked, so pointing out that it is a matter of the most
common experience that things in fact do move [11]. This answer, very clever and eﬀective
perhaps, is unfortunately completely misleading, because it is not the apparent motion what
Zeno questions but how this motion is logically possible. And the Diogenes’s answer does
not enlighten us at all in this respect [12]:

A bearded sage once said that there’s no motion.
His silent colleague simply strolled before him, --
How could he answer better?! -- all adored him!
And praised his wise reply with great devotion.
But men, this is enchanting! -- let me interject,
For me, another grand occurrence comes to play:
The sun rotates around us every single day,
And yet, the headstrong Galileo was correct.

But what is paradoxical in Zeno’s arguments? Let us take a closer look. He says that any
movement can be subdivided into inﬁnite number of ever decreasing steps. This is not by
itself paradoxical, if we assume inﬁnite divisibility of space and time. What is paradoxical is
an ability to perform inﬁnite number of subtasks in a ﬁnite time – to perform a supertask.
Any movement seems to be a supertask according to Zeno and it is by no means obvious
that it is ever possible to perform inﬁnite number of actions in a ﬁnite time. Our intuition
tells us just the contrary – that it is a clear impossibility for ﬁnite beings to manage any
supertask. In the case of Dichotomy it is even not clear how the movement can begin at all
because there is no ﬁrst step to be taken.

Aristotle tried to resolve this situation by distinguishing potential and actual inﬁnities
[13]: “To the question whether it is possible to pass through an inﬁnite number of units
either of time or of distance we must reply that in a sense it is and in a sense it is not. If
the units are actual, it is not possible; if they are potential, it is possible”. But Aristotle’s
answer is not much better than Diogenes’.
In fact doubly incomplete.
According to it Zeno’s inﬁnite subdivision of a motion is purely mathematical, just an
action of imagination. But even if we accept Aristotle’s position it is desirable to show that
in mathematics we have tools to handle inﬁnities in a logically coherent way. In fact no
such tools were at Aristotle’s disposal and they were only germinated after two thousand
years when the notion of limit emerged, Calculus was developed and Georg Cantor created
his set theory. We can say that Dichotomy is not mathematically paradoxical today. Either
classical or non-standard [14, 15] analysis can supply suﬃcient machinery to deal with both
the Dichotomy and its more famous counterpart, the Achilles and the tortoise paradox [2]:

It is incomplete.

3

•

The slower will never be overtaken by the quicker, for that which is pursuing must
ﬁrst reach the point from which that which is ﬂeeing started, so that the slower must
always be some distance ahead.

This latter paradox is more impressively formulated in terms of two bodies but in fact it is a
symmetric counterpart of the Dichotomy and has a variant involving only one moving body
[16]: “To reach a given point, a body in motion must ﬁrst traverse half of the distance, then
half of what remains, half of this latter, and so on ad inﬁnitum, and again the goal can never
be reached”. Therefore if the Dichotomy wonders how the motion can begin as there is no
ﬁrst step, the Achilles makes it equally problematic the end of the motion because there
is no last step. Modern mathematics partly completes Aristotle’s argument and provides a
coherent mathematical picture of motion. But all this mathematical developments, although
very wonderful, do not answer the main question implicit in Aristotle’s rebuttal of Zeno:
how the real motion actually takes place and whether its present day mathematical image
still corresponds to reality at the most fundamental level.

4 Zeno meets Banach and Tarski

Let us take, for example, inﬁnite divisibility of space and time. This inﬁnite divisibility is
in fact paradoxical, even though the modern mathematics have no trouble to deal with this
inﬁnite divisibility. Let us explain what we have in mind.

Zeno’s argument shows that any spatial or temporal interval contains uncountably many
points. Nevertheless a moving body manages to traverse all these points in a ﬁnite time.
Let us consider any division of the interval into non-empty pairwise mutually exclusive
subintervals (that is any pair of them have no common points). Then there exists at least
indeed, a
one set N that contains one and only one point from each of the subintervals.
moving point body enters into a given subinterval sooner or later while traversing the initial
interval and will remain into this subinterval for some amount of time. We can take any
point the moving body occupies during this time interval as an element of N. All this seems
very natural and self-evident, and so does its natural generalization, the axiom of choice
[17]:

•

If M is any collection of pairwise mutually exclusive, non-empty sets P, there exists at
least one set N that contains one and only one element from each of the sets P of the
collection M.

If one may choose an element from each of the sets P of M, the set N can evidently be
formed – hence the name of the axiom.

Now this innocently looking “self-evident” axiom leads to the most paradoxical result in
the mathematics, the Banach-Tarski theorem, which is so contrary to our intuition that is
better known as the Banach-Tarski paradox. The most artistic presentation of this paradox
can be found in the Bible [18]: “As he went ashore he saw a great throng; and he had
compassion on them, and healed their sick. When it was evening, the disciples came to him
and said: ”This is a lonely place, and the day is now over; send the crowds away to go into
the villages and buy food for themselves”. Jesus said: ”They need not go away; you give
them something to eat”. They said to him: ”We have only ﬁve loaves here and two ﬁsh”.

4

And he said: ”Bring them here to me”. Then he ordered the crowds to sit down on the
grass; and taking the ﬁve loaves and the two ﬁsh he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and
broke and gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds. And
they all ate and were satisﬁed. And they took up twelve baskets full of the broken pieces
left over. And those who ate were about ﬁve thousand men, besides women and children”.

In the more formal language the Banach-Tarski theorem states that [17]

•

in any euclidean space of dimension n > 2, any two arbitrary bounded sets are equiv-
alent by ﬁnite decomposition provided they contain interior points.

This theorem opens, for example, the door to the following mathematical alchemy [17]:
a ball of the size of orange can be divided into a ﬁnite number of pieces which can be
reassembled by using merely translations and rotations to yield a solid ball whose diameter
is larger than the size of the solar system. Of course a real orange cannot be chopped in
such a way because atoms and molecules constitute a limit of divisibility of any chemical
substance and the pieces required in the Banach-Tarski theorem are so irregular that they
are nonmeasurable and the concept of volume (Lebesgue measure) does not make sense for
them. But does space-time itself also have a limit of divisibility? It is yet an open question.
The comprehensive discussion of the Banach-Tarski theorem is given in [19] and for an
elementary approach with a full proof of the theorem see [20]. One can question whether
paradoxical counter-intuitive decompositions like the ones implied by the Banach-Tarski
theorem are of any use in physics. Surprisingly, there were several attempts in this direction.
Pitowsky was the ﬁrst (to our knowledge) to consider a certain extension of the concept of
probability to nonmeasurable sets in connection with the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox
and Bell’s inequalities [21, 22]. Another examples can be traced trough [23, 24].

One cannot blame the axiom of choice as the only culprit of such paradoxical mathemat-
ical results. Even without the use of this axiom one can argue that there is some truth in
the proverb that the world is small, because the results proved in [25] entirely constructively,
without the axiom of choice, imply that there is a ﬁnite collection of disjoint open subsets
of the sun that ﬁll the whole sun without holes of positive radius and that nevertheless can
be rearranged by rigid motions to ﬁt inside a pea and remain disjoint.

Maybe the the Banach-Tarski theorem and analogous paradoxical decompositions will
appear a bit less paradoxical if we realize that the Achilles and the tortoise paradox illustrates
that any two intervals contain the same number of points regardless their length. Indeed,
during their race Achilles and the tortoise cover desperately diﬀerent intervals. Nevertheless
one can arrange a one-to-one correspondence between points of these intervals because for
every point A from the Achilles’ track there is only one point B on the track of tortoise
which the tortoise occupied at the same instant of time when Achilles occupied A. In fact,
as Cantor proved in 1877, there is a one-to-one correspondence of points on the interval
[0, 1] and points in a square, or points in any n-dimensional space. Cantor himself was
surprised at his own discovery and wrote to Dedekind [26] “I see it, but I don’t believe it!”

5 Zeno meets quantum mechanics

Despite some paradoxical ﬂavour, the inﬁnite divisibility of real space-time, although un-
warranted at yet, is mathematically coherent. But Zeno’s paradoxes contain some other

5

physical premises also that deserve careful consideration. The Achilles and the tortoise
paradox, for example, assumes some observation procedure:

check the positions of the contenders in the race.

•

•

•

check again when Achilles reach the position the tortoise occupied at previous step.

repeat the previous instruction until Achilles catch the tortoise (and this is an inﬁnite
loop because he never does).

Calculus teach us that the above observational process covers only ﬁnite interval of time in
spite of its inﬁnitely many steps. And during this time interval the tortoise will be indeed
always ahead of Achilles. The observational procedure Zeno is oﬀering simply does not
allow us to check the contenders positions later when Achilles overtake the tortoise. So the
paradox is solved? Not at all. Zeno’s procedure implicitly assumes an ability to perform
position measurements. Therefore two questions remain: whether it is possible to perform
inﬁnitely frequent measurements taken for granted by Zeno, and how the race will be eﬀected
by back-reaction from these measurements. The world is quantum mechanical after all and
the measurement process is rather subtle thing in quantum mechanics.

Simple arguments [27] show that something interesting is going on if the observational
procedure of Zeno is considered from the quantum mechanical perspective. Let

After a short time t the state vector will evolve into

is positive (there should be some energy spread in the initial state because we assume good
enough localizations for Achilles and the tortoise). If these measurements are performed
n-times, at intervals t/n, there is a probability

that at all times the system will be found in the initial state. But this probability tends to

Therefore, if the observations are inﬁnitely frequent the initial state does not change at all.
Zeno was right after all: Achilles will never catch the tortoise under proposed observational
scheme! This scheme implicitly assumes a continues monitoring of Achilles’ position and
therefore he will fail even to start the race.

Matters are not as simple however. Repeated measurement of a system eﬀects its dy-
namics much more complex and delicate way than just slowing the evolution [28]. The above
described Quantum Zeno Eﬀect became popular after seminal paper of Misra and Sudarshan
[29], although it dates back to Alan Turing (see [30, 31] and references wherein) and was
known earlier as “Turing’s paradox”. The initial time t2 dependence of quantum mechanical
evolution, from which the Quantum Zeno Eﬀect follows most simply, is quite general though
not universal. The experimental diﬃculty resides in the fact that the t2 dependence takes
place usually at very short times for natural unstable systems. For example, the ”Zeno” time
10−15 s
of the 2P-1S transition of the hydrogen atom is estimated to be approximately 3.6
[32]. Nevertheless modern experimental techniques enable to prepare artiﬁcial unstable sys-
tems with long enough Zeno time. In beautiful experiment [33] ultra-cold sodium atoms
were trapped in a periodic optical potential created by a accelerated standing wave of light.
Classically atoms can be trapped inside the potential wells but they will escape by quantum
tunneling. The number that remain is measured as a function of duration of the tunneling.
The results are shown in the Fig.1. Hollow squares in this ﬁgure show the probability of
survival in the accelerated potential as a function of duration of the tunneling acceleration.
The solid line represents what is expected according to quantum mechanics and we see a
very good agreement with the experimental data. The Zeno time for this unstable system is
of the order of about µs and during this short time period the survival probability exhibits
a t2 drop. For longer times we see a gradual transition from the t2 dependence to linear
t dependence, which corresponds to the usual exponential decay law. Such behaviour can
be simply understood in the framework of time-dependent perturbation theory [34]. The

In the experiment [33] the number of atoms remaining in the potential well after some
time of tunneling was measured by suddenly interrupting the tunneling by a period of
reduced acceleration. For the reduced acceleration tunneling was negligible and the atoms
increased their velocity without being lost out of the well. Therefore the remaining atoms

and the ones having tunneled out up to the point of interruption become separated in
velocity space enabling the experimenters to distinguish them. This measurement of the
number of remaining atoms projects the system in a new initial state when the acceleration
is switched back and the system returns to its unstable state. The evolution must therefore
start again with the non-exponential initial segment and one expects the Zeno impeding of
the evolution under frequent measurements.

Figure 2: Observation of the Quantum Anti-Zeno Eﬀect in the experiment [33].

Fig.1 really shows the Zeno eﬀect in a rather dramatic way. The solid circles in this
ﬁgure correspond to the measurement of the survival probability when after each tunneling
segment of 1 µs an interruption of 50 µs duration was inserted. One clearly sees a much
slower decay trend compared to the measurements without frequent interruptions (hollow
squares). Some disagreement with the theoretical expectation depicted by the solid line is
attributed by the authors of [33] to the under-estimate of the actual tunneling time, so that
in reality the decay might be slowed down even at higher degree.

9

Uninterrupted decay curve shows damped oscillatory transition region between initial
period of slow decay and the exponential decay at longer times. At that a steep drop in the
survival probability is observed immediately after the Zeno time. It is expected, therefore,
that the decay will be not slowed down but accelerated if frequent interruptions take place
during the steep drop period of evolution forcing the system to repeat the initial period of
fast decay again and again after every measurement. This so called Quantum Anti-Zeno
eﬀect [35, 36, 37] is experimentally demonstrated in Fig.2. The solid circles in this ﬁgure
show the evolution of the unstable system when after every 5 µs of tunneling the decay was
interrupted by a slow acceleration segment.

6 Supertasks

The Zeno and Anti-Zeno eﬀects in quantum theory are of course very interesting phenomena
and even some practical application of the Zeno eﬀect in quantum computing is foreseeable
[38]. But in the context of Zeno paradoxes we are more interested in the limit of inﬁnitely
frequent measurements with complete inhibition of evolution. Although such limit leads to
interesting mathematics [39], its physical realizability is dubious. The Calculus argument
that it is possible for inﬁnite sum to converge to a ﬁnite number is not suﬃcient to ensure
a possibility to perform a supertask. This becomes obvious if we somewhat modify Zeno’s
arguments to stress the role supertasks play in them. The resulting paradox, Zeno Zigzag,
goes as follows [2]. A light ray is bouncing between an inﬁnite sequence of mirrors as
illustrated in the Fig.3. The sizes of mirrors and their separations decrease by a factor

Figure 3: The Zeno Zigzag.

of two on each step. The total length of the photon’s zigzag path is ﬁnite (because the
geometric series 1+1/2+1/4+...converges), as well as the envelope box size around the
mirrors. Therefore the photon is expected to perform inﬁnite number of reﬂections in ﬁnite
time and emerge on the other side of our mirror box. But the absence of the last mirror the
photon hit is obviously troublesome now: there is no logical way for the photon to decide
at what direction to emerge from the box.

10

Of course, in reality it is impossible to realize the Zeno Zigzag for a number of reasons.
One cannot make arbitrarily small “mirrors”, for example, because sharp localization leads
to a signiﬁcant momentum spread according to uncertainty relations and then the relativity
makes possible a pair production which will smear the “mirror” position. The wave-like
behaviour of the photon (or any other particle) will anyway make impossible to maintain
deﬁnite direction of the reﬂected photon if the mirror size is less than the photon wavelength.
The question, however, naturally arises whether supertasks are logically impossible ir-
respective of the nature of physical reality which may restrict their practical realization.
To support the opinion that the very notion of completing an inﬁnite sequence of acts in
a ﬁnite time is logically contradictory, Thomson suggested the following supertask [40]. A
lamp is switched ON and OFF more and more rapidly so that at the end of the two minutes
a supertask of inﬁnite switching of the lamp is over. The question now is whether the lamp
is in the ON state or in the OFF state after this two minutes. Clearly the lamp must be in
one of these states but both seem equally impossible. The lamp cannot be in the ON state
because we never turned it on without immediately turning it oﬀ. But the lamp cannot be
in the OFF state either because we never turned it oﬀ without at once turning it on. It
seems impossible to answer the question and avoid a contradiction.

Figure 4: Alternative switching mechanisms for Thomson’s lamp from [42].

The Thomson lamp argument is seductive but fallacious [41, 42]. Surprisingly there is
a coherent answer to the Thomson’s question without any contradiction. To come to this

11

answer, it is instructive to consider another supertask [42] which is not paradoxical in any
obvious way. A ball bounces on a hard surface so that on each rebound it loses 1
k-fraction
of its velocity prior to the bounce, where 0 < k < 1. The ball will perform inﬁnitely many
bounces in a ﬁnite time because, in classical mechanics, the time between bounces is directly
proportional to the initial velocity of the ball and the geometric series 1, k, k2, k3, ... has
ﬁnite sum 1/(1
k). Now let us use this bouncing ball as a switching mechanism for the
Thomson’s lamp. Then it is immediately obvious that depending on the organization of the
circuit the lamp can be in either state (ON or OFF) after the supertask is completed, see
Fig.4.

−

−

Logic once again demonstrates its ﬂexibility. Note that even such a weird notion as the
lamp being in a superposition of the ON and OFF states makes perfect sense in quantum
mechanics. Although, as was indicated above, we can make the Thomson’s lamp logically
consistent without any such weirdness. But other surprises with supertasks are lurking
ahead.

In [43] P´erez Laraudogoitia constructed a beautifully simple supertask which demon-
strates some weird things even in the context of classical mechanics. Fig.5 shows an inﬁnite
set of identical particles arranged in a straight line. The distance between the particles and
their sizes decrease so that the whole system occupies an interval of unit length. Some other
particle of the same mass approaches the system from the right with unit velocity. In elastic
collision with identical particles the velocities are exchanged after the collision. Therefore
a wave of elastic collisions goes through the system in unit time. And what then? Any
particle of the system and the projectile particle comes to rest after colliding its left closest
neighbor. Therefore all particles are at rest after the collision supertask is over and we are
left with paradoxical conclusion [43] that the total initial energy (and momentum) of the
system of particles can disappear by means of an inﬁnitely denumerable number of elastic
collisions, in each one of which the energy (and momentum) is conserved!

Figure 5: P´erez Laraudogoitia’s supertask.

If you ﬁll uneasy about this energy-momentum nonconservation, here is the same story

in more entertaining incarnation [44].

Suppose you have some amount of one dollar bills and the Devil approaches you in a
nefarious underground bar. He says that he has a hobby of collecting one dollar bills of
particular serial numbers and it happened that you do have one such bill. So he is oﬀering
you a bargain: he will give you ten one dollar bills for this particular one. Should you accept
the bargain? Why not, it seems so proﬁtable. You agreed and the bargain is done. After
half an hour the Devil appears again with the similar oﬀer. Then after a quarter-hour and
so on. The time interval between his appearances decreases by a factor of two each time.
The amount of your money increases quickly. After an hour inﬁnite number of bargains are
done and how much money will you have? You would have a lot if the Devil wanted you to
succeed. But he tries to perish your soul not to save it and during the bargains is indeed

12

very selective about bill serial numbers: he always takes the bill with smallest serial number
you posses and instead gives the bills with serial numbers greater than any your bill’s at
that moment. Under such arrangement any bill you posses will end its path into Devil’s
pocket. Indeed, for any particular bill at your disposal at some instant you will have only
ﬁnite amount of bills with less serial numbers and you never will get additional bills with
smaller serial numbers. Therefore sooner or later this particular bill will become the bill
with smallest serial number among your bills and hence subject of the exchange. We come
again to the strange conclusion that in spite of your money’s continuous growth during the
transaction you will have no bill at all left after the inﬁnite transaction is over!

Of course, this example does not enlighten us much about how the initial energy disap-
pears in the P´erez Laraudogoitia’s supertask. However it clearly shows a somewhat infernal
ﬂavour the supertasks have. And not only the energy-momentum conservation is on stake.
Classical dynamics is time reversal invariant. Therefore the following process, which is the
time reversal of the P´erez Laraudogoitia’s supertask, is also possible [43]: a spontaneous self-
excitation can propagate through the inﬁnite system of balls at rest causing the ﬁrst ball to
be ejected with some nonzero velocity. The system displays not only the energy-momentum
non-conservation but also indeterminism [43, 45, 46].

The locus of the diﬃculty is the same as in the Zeno paradoxes: there is no last member
in a sequence of acts (collisions) and therefore there is no last ball to carry oﬀ the velocity
[47]. The supertask illustrate the indeterminism of classical Newtonian or even relativistic
dynamics as far as inﬁnite localization of bodies is admissible. In quantum mechanics balls
cannot be simultaneously at rest and inﬁnitely localized thanks to uncertainty relations.
Therefore P´erez Laraudogoitia’s supertask will not persist in quantum theory. However,
it was shown [48] that a (nonrelativistic) quantum mechanical supertask can be envisaged
in which the deterministic time development of the wave function is lost and spontaneous
self-excitation of the ground state is allowed. Yet pathologies disappear if one demands
normalizability of the state vector. In this sense quantum mechanical supertasks are better
behaved than their classical counterparts [48].

Surprisingly and contrary to common wisdom, classical Newtonian physics is more hostile
and unfriendly to determinism than either quantum mechanics or special relativity [49].
Another example of esoteric behaviour of seemingly benign Newtonian system was given
by Xia [50] while solving the century-old intriguing problem of noncollisional singularities.
Xia’s construction constitutes in fact a supertask and involves only ﬁve bodies interacting
via familiar Newtonian inverse square force law. The essentials of this supertask can be
explained as follows [51]. Imagine a system of two equal masses M moving in the x
y
plane under Newton’s law of attraction with center of mass at rest, and the third mass
m
M (so that it does not disturb the motion of the ﬁrst two) on the z-axis which goes
through the center of mass of the planar binary system. It is clear from the symmetry that
the total force of gravitational attraction acting on the mass m has only z-component and
therefore the third mass will experience a one dimensional motion along the z-axis. When
the mass m passes through and is lightly above the binary plane, we can arrange extremely
powerful downward pull on m if the highly elliptical binary has its closest approach at that
moment. In fact, assuming an ideal case of point masses, the downward force acting on
m can be made arbitrarily strong by just adjusting the separating distances among the
bodies. As a result the third mass is jolted down with high velocity while the binary starts
separating and loses signiﬁcantly its braking eﬀect on m.

≪

−

13

The mirror replica of the binary, see Fig.6, is placed at large distance (not to disturb
the ﬁrst binary) further down to prevent the mass m from being expelled to inﬁnity. In
case of proper timing, the second binary will break m’s downward motion and will thrust
it upwards with even higher velocity.

Figure 6: Xia’s ﬁve body supertask.

Xia was able to show that there exists a Cantor set of the initial conditions allowing to
repeat this behaviour inﬁnitely often in a ﬁnite time. As a result the four of ﬁve bodies
from the Xia’s construction will escape to spatial inﬁnity in a ﬁnite time, while the ﬁfth will
oscillate back and forth among the other four with ever increasing speed.

Xia’s supertask does not violate energy conservation, the bodies drawing out their en-
ergies from the inﬁnitely deep 1/r potential well. However it implies indeterminacy in
idealized Newtonian world. The time reverse of this supertask is an example of “space in-
vaders” [49], particles appearing from spatial inﬁnity in a surprise attack. Note that [49]
“the prospects for determinism brighten considerably when we leave classical spacetimes for
Minkowski spacetime, the spacetime setting for special relativistic theories”. Because with
no superluminal propagation there are no space invaders.

Leaving aside interesting philosophical questions raised by Xia’s supertask, it seems
otherwise completely artiﬁcial and far from reality. Curiously, some ideas involved in this
construction can be used by mankind, admittedly in the very long run, to transfer orbital
energy from Jupiter to the Earth by a suitable intermediate minor space body, causing the
Earth’s orbit to expand and avoid an excessive heating from enlarging and brightening Sun
at the last stage of its main sequence life [52].

7 Bifurcated supertasks

Let us return to Zeno. Hermann Weyl pointed out [53] another possibility mankind can
beneﬁt from Zeno supertask: “if the segment of length 1 really consists of inﬁnitely many
subsegments of length 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, . . ., as of “chopped-oﬀ” wholes, then it is incompatible
with the character of the inﬁnite as the “incompletable” that Achilles should have been able
to traverse them all. If one admits this possibility, then there is no reason why a machine
should not be capable of completing an inﬁnite sequence of distinct acts of decision within
a ﬁnite amount of time; say, by supplying the ﬁrst result after 1/2 minute, the second
after another 1/4 minute, the third 1/8 minute later than the second, etc. In this way it
would be possible, provided the receptive power of the brain would function similarly, to
achieve a traversal of all natural numbers and thereby a sure yes-or-no decision regarding
any existential question about natural numbers!”

Relativity brings additional ﬂaviour in discussion of Weyl’s inﬁnity machines. One can
imagine, for example, bifurcated supertasks [42, 54]. To check the Goldbach’s conjecture
whether every even number greater than two can be written as the sum of two primes,
the Master organizes two space missions. In one of them a computer, the Servant, is sent
with constant acceleration which examines all even numbers one case after the other. In
another space mission the Master himself contrives to accelerate in such a way to keep the
Servant within his causal horizon. It is possible to arrange Master’s acceleration so that the
Servant disappears from his causal shadow only after spending inﬁnite amount of time on
the Goldbach’s conjecture, while in the Master’s frame the amount of time passed remains
ﬁnite. If the Servant ﬁnds a counterexample to the Goldbach’s conjecture it sends a message
to the Master and the latter will know that the conjecture is false. If no message is received,
however, the Master will know in a ﬁnite time that Goldbach was wright.

This looks too good to be true and indeed the realization of such Pitowsky [55] inﬁnite
machine is suspicious for a number of reasons [42, 54]. The Servant moves with constant
acceleration during inﬁnite proper time. Therefore it needs an inﬁnite fuel supply. Moreover,
the Master’s acceleration increases without limit and eventually he would be crushed to
death by artiﬁcial gravity. There is a conceptual problem also. At no point on his world line
does the Master have a causal access to all events on the Servant’s world line. This means
there is no Moment of Truth, if the Goldbach’s conjecture is true, at which the Master
attained that knowledge. Emergence of the knowledge about validity of the Goldbach’s
conjecture will be as mysterious in Pitowsky bifurcated supertask as is the disappearance
of energy in P´erez Laraudogoitia’s supertask.

But general relativity allows to improve the above construction by admitting the so called
Malament-Hogarth spacetimes [54, 56]. In such a spacetime there is a point (the Malament-
Hogarth point) at Master’s world line such that entire inﬁnite history of the Servant’s
world line is contained in this point’s causal shadow. From that event on the Master will be
enlightened about validity of that particular number theoretic problem through the Servant’s
inﬁnite labors.

Some Malament-Hogarth spacetimes seem quite reasonable physically. Among them are
such well known spacetimes as the anti-de Sitter spacetime, Reissner-Nordstr¨om spacetime
and Kerr-Newman spacetime [57], the latter being the natural outcome of the late-time
evolution of a collapsed rotating star. Therefore it is not excluded that “if the Creator
had a taste for the bizarre we might ﬁnd that we are inhabiting one of them” [42]. Even

15

if this proves to be the case, the practical realization of inﬁnite computation is not at
all guaranteed. Physics beyond the classical general relativity, for example proton decay
and other issues related to the long term fate of the universe [58], can prohibit the inﬁnite
calculations. There is still another reason that can make a practical realization of bifurcated
supertasks dubious [55]: the Servant might have inﬁnite time to accomplish its labors but
not enough computation space. the argument goes as follows [59, 60].

Any system which performs computation as an irreversible process will dissipate energy.
Many-to-one logical operations such as AND or ERASE are not reversible and require dis-
sipation of at least kT ln 2 energy per bit of information lost when performed in a computer
at temperature T . While one-to-one logical operations such as NOT are reversible and in
theory can be performed without dissipation [61].

That erasure of one bit information has an energy cost kT ln 2 (the Landauer’s principle)

can be demonstrated by Maxwell’s demon paradox originally due to Leo Szilard [62, 63].

Figure 7: Szilard’s demon engine.

A schematic view of the Szilard’s demon engine is shown in the Fig.7. Initially the entire
volume of a cylinder is available to the one-atom working gas (step (a)). At step (b) the
demon measures the position of the atom and if it is found in the right half of the cylinder
inserts a piston. At step (c) the one-atom gas expands isothermally by extracting necessary
heat from the reservoir and lifts the load. At step (d) the piston is removed and the system
is returned to its initial state ready to repeat the cycle.

16

It seems the Szilard’s demon engine defeats the second law of thermodynamics: the heat
bath, which has transferred energy to the gas, has lowered its entropy while the engine
has not changed its entropy because it returned to the initial state. But this reasoning is
fallacious because it misses an important point: the demon has not returned to his initial
state. He still possesses one bit information about left-right position of the atom he recorded.
The system truly to return to its initial state it is necessary to erase this information from
the demon’s memory. According to the Landauer’s principle, one has to pay kT ln 2 energy
cost for this erasure. On the other hand work done during isothermal expansion equals

V

pdV =

and normalized to one atom this is just (R/NA)T ln 2 = kT ln 2. Therefore all extracted
work is paid back for erasure of the demon’s memory and the net eﬀect of the circle is zero.
The second law defeats the demon.

In principle all computations could be performed using reversible logical operations and
hence without energy cost [61]. Interestingly enough, some important stages of biomolecular
information processing, such as transcription of DNA to RNA, appear to be accomplished
by reversible chemical reactions [64]. Real computers, however, are subject to thermal
ﬂuctuations that cause errors. To perform reliable computations, therefore, some error-
correcting codes must be used to detect inevitable errors and reject them to the environment
at the cost of energy dissipation [61].

The Servant computer from bifurcated supertask needs to consume energy from sur-
rounding universe to perform its task. Diﬀerent energy mining strategies were considered in
[59] and it was shown that none of them allows to gather inﬁnite amount of energy even in
inﬁnite time irrespective assumed cosmological model. To perform inﬁnite number of com-
putations with ﬁnite available energy the Servant should be able to continuously decrease
its operating temperature to reduce the energy cost of computations. But the Servant is
not completely free to choose its temperature: the waste heat produced while performing
computations must be radiated away to avoid overheating. But physical laws place limits
on the rate at which the waste heat can be radiated. Assuming that the electromagnetic
dipole radiation by electrons is the most eﬃcient way to get rid of the heat, Dyson argued
[65] that there is a lower limit on the operating temperature

1023 for humans)
where Q is a measure of the complexity of the computing device (Q
and Ne is the number of electrons in the computer. Since Q/Ne cannot be made arbitrarily
small, it seems inﬁnite computations are impossible.

∼

But where is a way out [65]: hibernation. The Servant can compute intermittently while
continuing to radiate waste heat into space during its periods of hibernation. This strategy
will allow to operate below the Dyson limiting temperature. But eventually the wavelength
of thermal radiation will become very large compared to the characteristic size of the com-
puter, the thermal energies will be small compared to the characteristic quantized energy
levels of the system and radiation will be suppressed by an exponential factor compared to

the estimates of Dyson [59]. Therefore the Servant must increase its size as time goes by. It
also needs more and more memory to store digital codes of ever increasing even and prime
numbers. This is another reason it to increase in size. But as was mentioned above there is
only ﬁnite amount of energy, and hence material, available. Therefore it appears the servant
will not be able to accomplish its inﬁnite labors.

8 Zeno meets Newton and Wigner

Our discussion of Zeno’s paradoxes indicates a rather subtle role the concept of localization
plays in description of motion. It is not surprising therefore that the notion of localization
in relativistic quantum mechanics was intensively examined. Many concepts of localization
have been proposed but we focus on the one known as the Newton-Wigner localization
[66, 67]. Initially this concept of localization and the corresponding position operators were
suggested in the context of the single particle relativistic quantum mechanics. But later their
result was reformulated in quantum ﬁeld theory also, where the concept of local observables
is the central concept leading to numerous troubles (inﬁnities) which are swept under carpet
with great artistic skill by renormalization. Many troubles related to localization in rela-
tivistic quantum ﬁeld theory have their formal root in the Reeh-Schlieder theorem which in
the non-formal artistic formulation of Hans Halvorson [68] states that the vacuum is seething
with activity at the local level: any local event has the nonzero probability to occur in the
vacuum state for the standard localization scheme. The Newton-Wigner localization scheme
avoids some consequences of the Reeh-Schlieder theorem and leads to a mathematical struc-
ture which seems more comfortable for our a priori physical intuition about localization
[69]. But the story is not yet over. The suggested generalizations of the Newton-Wigner
localization are still not immune against the full strength of the Reeh-Schlieder theorem and
have their own counterintuitive features [68, 70].

Let us sketch the derivation of the Newton-Wigner position operator for Dirac particles
[71]. The Newton-Wigner operator ˆQk can be deﬁned as the operator whose eigenvalues
are the most localized wave-packets formed from only positive-energy solutions of the Dirac
equation. Let ψ(s)
(~y)(~x) be such a wave-function describing an electron with spin projection s
localized at the point ~y at the time t = 0. Deﬁning the scalar product by

is essentially the conventional relativistic velocity for positive-energy wave functions. But
the last term in (12) is at odds with our classical intuition. According to it the Dirac
electron executes rapid oscillatory motion, which Schr¨odinger called “Zitterbewegung”. As
~α(t)
~α(t) = 1, the instantaneous value of electron’s velocity during this trembling motion
is always 1 (that is the velocity of light). The Zitterbewegung is a result of an interference
between positive and negative frequency Fourier components of the particle wave-packet.
The way the Zitterbewegung shows itself depends on the character of the particle wave-
packet [75]. In the case of plane wave (not localized particles) one has a steady-state violent

It seems therefore that the quantum mechanics and relativity create conceptual prob-
lems for Zeno’s prescription to observe Achilles and the tortoise race (check the tortoise
position when Achilles reach the position tortoise occupied at previous step). If we use the
Dirac position for this goal, we will face Zitterbewegung, and if we use the Newton-Wigner
one, the contenders will be not sharply localized. The notion of object’s localization, which
seems so benignly obvious in classical mechanics, undergoes a radical change when distances
are smaller than the Compton wavelength of the object. At ﬁrst sight the notion of local-
ization at Compton scales appears as purely academic concept because even for electron the
Compton wavelength is very small and the Zitterbewegung frequency very high, far beyond
the present day experimental accessibility. But this situation can be changed in near future
thanks to narrow-gap semiconductors [78].

In such semiconductors the dispersion relation between the energy and the wavenumber
for electrons is analogous to that of relativistic electrons in vacuum and as a result eﬀective
relativity arises with maximum velocity of about 108 cm/sec instead of the velocity of light
[78, 79]. Such systems can be used to model various relativistic phenomena the Zitterbe-
wegung included. The amplitude of the corresponding trembling motion in semiconductors
can be quite large, as much as 64 ˚A for InSb [78], and can be experimentally observed using
high-resolution scanning-probe microscopy imaging techniques [80].

9 Quantum revivals of Zeno

Achilles is localized not only at the initial instant but remains so during the whole race.
Maybe for Zeno this facet of classical world was not paradoxical at all but it appears not
so trivial at modern times, after the quantum revolution.
In quantum mechanics wave-
packets spread as time goes by and it is not after all obvious how the classical reality with
its deﬁniteness arises from the weird quantum world. It is assumed, usually, that classical
behaviour of macroscopic objects, like Achilles and tortoise, is something obvious and always
guaranteed. But this is not correct. For example, a cryogenic bar gravity-wave detector

24

must be treated as a quantum harmonic oscillator even though it may weigh several tons
[81]. Superconductivity and superﬂuidity provide another examples of quantum behaviour
at macroscopic scales.

To illustrate surprises that a quantum particle on a racetrack can oﬀer, let us consider a
wave packet of an electron in a hydrogen atom constructed from a superposition of highly ex-
cited stationary states centered at a large principal quantum number ¯n = 320 [82]. Initially
the wave packet is well-localized near a point on the electron’s classical circular orbit. Then
it propagates around the orbit in accordance with the correspondence principle. During
the propagation the wave packet spreads along the orbit and after a dozen classical periods
TKepler appears as nearly uniformly distributed around the orbit (Fig.8)

Figure 8: Circular-orbit wave packet at initial stages of its time evolution [82].

If we wait long enough something extraordinary will happen: after some time Trev the
wave packet contracts and reconstructs its initial form (Fig.9). This resurrection of the wave
packet from the dead is called a quantum revival and it is closely related to the Talbot eﬀect
in optics [83]. In many circumstances the revivals are almost perfect and repeat as time

25

goes on. At times (k1/k2)Trev, where k1 and k2 are two mutually prime numbers, fractional
revivals happen and the wave packet consists of several high-correlated smaller clones of the
original packet.

Figure 9: Wave-packet revival and fractional revivals [82].

To explain the origin of quantum revivals, let us consider a particle of mass m in an

inﬁnite square well of width L [84, 85]. The energy spectrum of the system is given by

Suppose the initial wave function is

(15)

for all nonzero an, where Nn is an integer that can depend on n and ϕ does not depend on

But (15) is fulﬁlled if

and ϕ = 0. Therefore any quantum state in an inﬁnite square well will be exactly revived
after a time Trev. Note that the classical period of bouncing back and forth between the

plotted over long time periods (of the order of Trev) it exhibits ﬁne interference patterns
known as quantum carpets [86, 87]. Some examples are shown in Fig.10.

Contemporary experimental technique allows to investigate quantum revivals and carpets
and many theoretical results have been conﬁrmed by experiments [83, 88]. Of course, nothing
remotely similar to this weird phenomena happens during the Achilles and the tortoise race.
And we come to one more paradox: why Zeno’s paradoxes, formulated purely in classical
terms, make complete sense for us? The answer may sound like this [81]: “The environment
surrounding a quantum system can, in eﬀect, monitor some of the systems observables.
As a result, the eigenstates of these observables continuously decohere and can behave
like classical states”. Objects have no a priori classical properties. These properties are
emergent phenomenon and come into being only through the very weak interaction with
the ubiquitous degrees of freedom of the environment. Amazingly, the emergence of the
classical world seems to be just another side of the quantum Zeno eﬀect. As an example one
can consider a large chiral molecule (like sugar) which can have both left-handed and right-
handed classical spatial structures [89, 90]. For symmetry reasons, the ground state is equal
mixture of both chiral states. Chiral molecules are never found in energy eigenstates and this
is probably not surprising because such states are examples of Schr¨odinger cat states (like a
superposition of a dead and an alive cat) which look truly absurd from classical viewpoint.
But the real reason why nonclassical states of the Chiral molecules are not observed is that
it is chirality (not parity) that is recognized by the environment, for example by scattered air
molecules. The chirality of the molecule is thus continuously “observed” by the environment
and therefore cannot change because of quantum Zeno eﬀect.

10 Zeno meets quantum gravity

Another twist to the story of localization is added when one tries to incorporate gravity into
a quantum theory. Any sharp localization of the system creates a signiﬁcant local energy
density due to uncertainty relations and therefore changes the space-time metric according
to the philosophy of general relativity. This can eﬀect another localization eﬀort nearby in
an unavoidable manner [91] and as a result it will matter whether x-position measurement

28

Figure 10: The quantum carpets for the P¨oschel-Teller and Rosen-Morse potentials [85].

is carried before or after y-position measurement. Moreover, localization sharper than the
Plankian scale creates a singularity in the space-time metric and therefore is problematic.
We expect consequently that any coherent quantum gravity theory will not only bring the
fundamental Plankian scale as the limit of space-time divisibility with it, but also a non-
commutative space-time geometry.

Not only the concept of localization of material objects but also operational meaning of
the space-time itself is expected to be lost at Plankian scales. The principles of quantum
mechanics and general relativity limit the accuracy of space-time distance measurements.
The argument goes as follows [92].

Suppose we want to measure the initial distance between Achilles and the tortoise. We
can attach a small mirror to the tortoise while a clock with light-emitter and receiver to
Achilles. When the clock reads zero a light signal is sent to be reﬂected by the mirror. If the

29

reﬂected signal arrives back at time t then the distance is l = ct/2. Note that this is a quite
realistic scheme used, for example, in Lunar Laser Ranging experiments [93]. Quantum
mechanics sets some limits on ultimate precision which can be reached in such distance
measurements. Let, for example, the initial uncertainty in the clock’s position be ∆x. Then
according to uncertainty relation its speed is also uncertain with the spread

where m is the mass of the clock. At time t the uncertainty of the clock’s position will be
larger

∆x(t) = ∆(x(0) + vt) =

(∆x)2 + (t∆v)2 =

The optimal uncertainty at initial time that minimizes the uncertainty at time t is given by

where λC = ¯h/mc is the Compton wavelength of the clock. The mirror contributes similarly
to the overall uncertainty of the distance l to be measured. Therefore, ignoring small factors
of the order of 2, we obtain an order of magnitude estimate [92, 94] (the argument actually
goes back to Wigner [95, 96])

r

r

Hence we need massive clock to reduce the uncertainty. But the mass of the clock cannot be
increased indeﬁnitely because the distance l should be greater than the clock’s Schwarzschild
radius. Otherwise the clock will collapse into a black hole as it is assumed that its size is
smaller than l. Therefore

and inserting this into (16) we get

where

is the Planck length.

Ng and Van Dam argue even for a more restrictive bound [92]. suppose the clock consists
of two parallel mirrors a distance d apart. Then its one tick cannot be less than d/c and
d if the clock is used for timing in distance measurements. But d should
this implies ∆l
be greater than the clock’s Schwarzschild radius. Therefore

It seems there is a common consensus about the validity of (17). While the more stronger
bound (19) is still under debate (see, for example, [94]). Nevertheless this latter bound is
consistent with the holographic principle [97] which states that the information content of
any region of space cannot exceed its surface area in Planck units. Indeed [98], suppose

In any case, we can conclude that basic principles of quantum mechanics and general
relativity strongly suggest discreteness of space-time at some fundamental scale. Zeno an-
ticipated such possibility and attacked it with another couple of paradoxes. The ﬁrst one,
the Arrow, states that [2]

•

If everything is either at rest or moving when it occupies a space equal to itself, while
the object moved is always in the instant, a moving arrow is unmoved.

Stated diﬀerently, if a particle exists only at a sequence of discrete instants of time, what
is the instantaneous physical properties of a moving particle which distinguishes it from
the not moving one? And if there is no such properties (well, the notion of instantaneous
velocity requires the concept of limit and thus is inappropriate in discrete space-time) how
the motion is possible?

Modern physics changed our perspective of particles and motion and the Arrow seems
not so disturbing today. For example we can defy it by stating that the arrow cannot be at
rest at deﬁnite position according to the uncertainty principle. Alternatively, we can evoke
special relativity and say that there is a diﬀerence how the world looks for a moving arrow
and for an arrow at rest [2]: they have diﬀerent planes of simultaneity. Special relativity
can cope also with the second Zeno paradox against space-time discreteness, the Stadium:

•

Consider two rows of bodies, each composed of an equal number of bodies of equal size.
They pass each other as they travel with equal velocity in opposite directions. Thus,
half a time is equal to the whole time.

If motion takes place in discrete quantum jumps then there should be an absolute upper
bound on velocity. The maximum velocity is achieved then all jumps are in the same
direction. The Stadium is intended to show logical impossibility of the maximum relative
velocity. Suppose the rows of bodies from the paradox move at maximum or nearly maximum
speed. Then in the rest frame of the ﬁrst row other bodies are approaching at twice or so the
maximum possible speed. Now we know that the latter inference is not sound. But Zeno was
right that radical change of classical concepts of space and time is necessary to assimilate

31

an observer-independent maximum velocity. “Space by itself and time by itself are to sink
fully into shadows and only a kind of union of the two should yet preserve autonomy” - to
quote Minkowski from his famous Cologne lecture in 1908.

In fact space-time discreteness coupled with the relativity principle assumes two invariant
scales: not only the maximum velocity but also the minimum length. In this respect the
special relativity refutation of Zeno is not complete. Only recently a signiﬁcant eﬀort was
invested in developing Doubly Special Relativity [99, 100] - relativity theories with two
observer-independent scales. These developments, although interesting, still are lacking
experimental conﬁrmation.

Doubly Special Relativity, if correct, should be a limiting case of quantum gravity - an
ultimate theory of quantum space-time and a major challenge of contemporary physics to
combine general relativity with quantum mechanics. This synthesis is not achieved yet but
curiously enough its outcome may turn out to vindicate Parmenidean view that time and
change are not fundamental reality. In any case the problem of time seems to be central in
quantum gravity because time plays conceptually diﬀerent roles in quantum mechanics and
general relativity not easy to reconcile [101, 102, 103, 104, 105].

In quantum mechanics time is an external parameter, not an observable in the usual sense
– it is not represented by an operator. Indeed, suppose there is an operator ˆT , representing
a perfect clock, such that in the Heisenberg picture ˆT (t) = ei ˆHt ˆT e−i ˆHt = t. Then (we are
using again ¯h = 1 convention)

i[ ˆH, ˆT (t)] =

ˆT (t) = 1.

d
dt

Therefore [ ˆT (t), ˆH] = i and [ ˆH, eiα ˆT ] = αeiα ˆT . If ψ is an energy eigenstate with energy E
then

ˆHeiα ˆT ψ =

[ ˆH, eiα ˆT ] + eiα ˆT ˆH
n

o

ψ = (E + α)eiα ˆT ψ.

Therefore eiα ˆT ψ is also the energy eigenstate with energy E + α and the Hamiltonian
spectrum cannot be bounded from below as it usually is. This argument goes back to
Pauli [106]. Alternatively we can resort to the Stone-von Neumann theorem [107] and argue
that the canonically conjugate ˆT and ˆH are just the disguised versions of the position and
momentum operators and therefore must have unbounded spectra.

However, there are subtleties in both the Pauli’s argument [106] as well as in the Stone-
von Neumann theorem [108] and various time operators are suggested occasionally. Note
that many useful concepts in physics are ambiguous or even incorrect from the mathematical
point of view. In an extremal manner this viewpoint was expressed by Dieudonn´e [109]:
”When one gets to the mathematical theories which are at the basis of quantum mechanics,
one realizes that the attitude of certain physicists in the handling of these theories truly
borders on the delirium”. Of course, this is an exaggeration but sometimes mathematical
reﬁnement leads to new physical insights and it is not excluded that the last word about
the time operator is not said yet. In any case, subtle is the time in quantum mechanics!

The idea of an event happening at a given time plays a crucial role in quantum theory
[110] and at ﬁrst sight introduces unsurmountable diﬀerence between space and time. For
2d~x = 1 for all times,
example [101], if Ψ(~x, t) is a normalized wave function then

because the particle must be somewhere in space at any given instant of time. While

Nevertheless, the conceptual foundation of quantum theory is compatible with special
relativity. Absolute Newtonian time is simply replaced by Minkowski spacetime ﬁxed back-
ground and unitary representations of the Poincar´e group can be used to develop quantum
theory. Situation changes dramatically in general relativity. “There is hardly any common
ground between the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics” [95]. The cen-
tral problem is that spacetime itself becomes a dynamical object in general relativity. Not
only matter is inﬂuenced by the structure of spacetime but the metric structure of space-
time depends on the state of ambient matter. As a result, the spatial coordinate ~x and
the temporal coordinate t lose any physical meaning whatsoever in general relativity. If in
non-general-relativistic physics (including special relativity) the coordinates correspond to
readings on rods and clocks, in general relativity they correspond to nothing at all and are
only auxiliary quantities which can be given arbitrary values for every event [95, 111].

Already at classical level, general relativity is a great deal Parmenidean and usually some
tacit assumptions which ﬁx the coordinate system is needed to talk meaningfully about time
and time-evolution. To quote Wigner [95] “Evidently, the usual statements about future
positions of particles, as speciﬁed by their coordinates, are not meaningful statements in
general relativity. This is a point which cannot be emphasized strongly enough and is the
basis of a much deeper dilemma than the more technical question of the Lorentz invariance
of the quantum ﬁeld equations.
It pervades all the general theory, and to some degree
we mislead both our students and ourselves when we calculate, for instance, the mercury
perihelion motion without explaining how our coordinate system is ﬁxed in space, what
deﬁnes it in such a way that it cannot be rotated, by a few seconds a year, to follow the
perihelion’s apparent motion”.

In quantum theory the situation only worsens. The Hamiltonian generates the time
evolution of quantum system. But the equations of motion of general relativity are invariant
under time reparametrization. Therefore the time evolution is in fact unobservable - it is a
gauge. The Hamiltonian vanishes and the Schr¨odinger equation in cosmology - the Wheeler-
DeWitt equation does not contain time. “General relativity does not describe evolution in
time: it describes the relative evolution of many variables with respect to each other” [111].
Zeno and Parmenides with their strange idea that time and change are some kind of illusion
still have chance in quantum gravity!

11 Conclusion

The main conclusion of this paper is that physics is beautiful. Questions aroused two and
half millennium ago and scrutinized many times are still not exhausted. Zeno’s paradoxes
deal with fundamental aspects of reality like localization, motion, space and time. New and
unexpected facets of these notions come into sight from time to time and every century ﬁnds
it worthwhile to return to Zeno over and over. The process of approaching to the ultimate
resolution of Zeno’s paradoxes seems endless and our understanding of the surrounding
world is still incomplete and fragmentary.

“Nevertheless, I believe that there is something great in astronomy, in physics, in all the
natural sciences that allows the human being to look beyond its present place and to arrive
at some understanding of what goes on beyond the insigniﬁcant meanness of spirit that so
often pervades our existence. There is a Nature; there is a Cosmos; and we walk towards

33

the understanding of it all. Is it not wonderful? There are many charms in the profession;
as many charms as in love provided, of course, that they are not in the service of mercantile
aims” [112].

Abstract

A quasi-physical model (having both physical and mathematical roots) of sprint perfor-

mances is presented, accounting for the inﬂuence of drag modiﬁcation via wind and altitude

variations. The race time corrections for both men and women sprinters are discussed,

and theoretical estimates for the associated drag areas are presented. The corrections are

consistent with constant-wind estimates of previous authors, however those for variable

wind are more accentuated for this model. As a practical example, the nulliﬁed World

Record and 1988 Olympic 100 m race of Ben Johnson is studied, and compared with the

present World Record of 9.79 s.

Introduction

Mathematical models of athletic sprinting/running performances, in some
form or another, date back to at least the early 1900s. A. V. Hill [1] was one
of the pioneers to study a sprinter’s “velocity curve”, or i.e. the runner’s
speed as a function of time. Mathematician Joseph Keller [2] formulated a
simplistic model to predict potential race times over a variety of distances.
His method involved optimizing the set of coupled diﬀerential equations

˙d(t) = v(t)
˙v(t) = f (t) − α v(t) ,

with the race distance calculated as the integral

d = Z T

0

v(t) dt .

(1)

(2)

In Equation (1), α is a decay constant which places upper limitations on
maximum velocities and velocity proﬁles. Solutions are obtained by solving
Equation 2 subject to the initial conditions v(0) = 0, d(0) = 0. Keller’s orig-
inal model for sprint races proposed a constant propulsive force, f (t) = F ,

1

arguing that the athlete must use his/her entire strength to maximize their
performance. In the works of Tibshirani [3] and Mureika [4], the propul-
sive term is adjusted to vary with time, since such intense physical exertion
will inevitably introduce muscular fatigue. Explicitly, a linear decrease was
chosen, f (t) = F − c t, where c > 0.

2 Quasi-physical model

While Tibshirani’s model yields an approximate match of ﬁnal times, it does
not completely represent a simulation of an actual race. A realistic model of
a sprint race should be able to accurately reproduce the critical 10 m split
data which is available2. In order to better realize this approximation, the
equation of motion (1) is modiﬁed as follows:

˙v(t) = fs + fm − fv − fd .

(3)

The term “quasi-physical” has been adopted to highlight the fact that Equa-
tion (3) is actually a mix of both mathematical and physical components. It
is not a fully physical representation, nor is is a purely mathematical model,
although it can be used to eﬀectively study and estimate key physical quan-
tities (such as the elusive drag area of sprinters).

The components of Equation (3) are deﬁned in the following subsections.

2.1 Drive term fs

A sprint race can be broken into roughly three diﬀerent phases: the drive,
transition, and maintenance phases. Previous models of sprint performances
(e.g.
[2, 3, 4] and references therein) assign a singular propulsive term in
the equation of motion. These do not explicitly account for the drive phase,
in which a sprinter begins a race from a crouched start. From this position,
the athlete is able to achieve greater speed due to increased application of
forces (eﬃcient drive posture). This phase of the race lasts for only about
the ﬁrst 25-30 metres, at which time the sprinter has transitioned to an
upright running stance.

In the current model the following form of the drive term is adopted:

2A “split” is deﬁned as the elapsed time at each 10 m division of the race, or the time-
interval in which a 10 m stretch is covered. The athlete’s instantaneous velocities may be
obtained for each 10 m increment, but due to technological and ﬁnancial restrictions, this
type of data is currently rare.

2

fs = f0 exp(−σ t2) ,

(4)

where f0 is the magnitude of the drive, and σ a constant to be determined.
The t2 dependence ensures that the term drops oﬀ rapidly as the race pro-
gresses. In fact, after roughly t = 3 seconds, the magnitude of the term drops
to less than 0.1% of its original value, which would correspond roughly to
the appropriate distance described above.

2.2 Maintenance term fm

This term is left relatively intact from the previous models, but assumes a
slightly diﬀerent interpretation. Once the drive term has dissipated, this
term is the only remaining propulsive component of Equation 3, and repre-
sents the maintenance phase of the race. Explicitly,

fm = f1 exp(−c t) .

(5)

Note that, unlike the linear maintenance term assumed in [3, 4], the time-
dependence assumed herein is non-negative ∀ t. Certainly, this is a much
more realistic assumption.

Due to the adoption of the drive term (4), the value of f1 tends to be
lower than predicted in previous models. While this does not immediately
eﬀect predictions for 100 metre performances, it does have signiﬁcant impli-
cations for 200 metre dash simulations (for which previous models have made
rather generous performance predictions; these are discussed in detail in a
forthcoming article [5]). This diﬀerence is further discussed in Section 3.3.

2.3 Velocity term fv

The ﬁrst of two counter-propulsive terms, the velocity term is another relic
of the original Keller model, which accounts for a predicted v(t) dependence
in the equation of motion. Such a term has some conceivable physical inter-
pretations: there must exist a physical barrier which limits the maximum
speed of a human, based more than just on pure muscular strength. It seems
logical to assume that a sprinter’s acceleration is curtailed with increasing
speed (e.g.
leg-turnover or stride rate are physically and physiologically-
constrained quantities). The term is written

fv = α v(t) ,

(6)

3

with α > 0 a positive constant. A reasonable assumption might be that
the value of this parameter (based on the interpretation above) is a “physi-
ological constant” for most sprinters, and should not vary signiﬁcantly from
a prescribed value. Most world-class sprinters show stride-rates of about
4-5 strides/second (see e.g. the analysis in [6]).

2.4 Drag term fd

Along with the drive term, this is the most signiﬁcant adjustment to the
model. Explicitly,

fd = (cid:18)1 −

1
4

exp{−σ t2}(cid:19) ρ(H)Ad (v(t) − w)2 .

(7)

The athlete is thus modeled as a thin slab of frontal cross-sectional area
A, which is a suﬃcient approximation for the eﬀects considered herein. A
critical factor in (7) is the “modiﬁed drag area” Ad = Cd·A/M . Here, Cd the
drag coeﬃcient, and M the sprinter’s mass (since these models are expressed
in force per unit mass). The exact values of these parameters are unknown,
since they can only be measured experimentally. Previous works [7, 8] have
suggested that A falls around 0.45 m2. Additionally, these authors suggest
that the drag coeﬃcient Cd assumed a value on the order of 0.9 − 1.0, but
a recent suggestion by Linthorne [9] pegs the value as closer to 0.6. The
data obtained from this model is consistent with this statement, and in fact
indicates that Cd may assume an even lower value (see Section 3).

The expression (1 − 1/4 exp(−σ t2)) in (7) is designed as an initial cor-
rection to the cross-sectional area A, representative of the transition from a
crouched to upright position. Although the value 1/4 is purely subjective,
the actual magnitude of the correction does not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the re-
sults. It does, however, allow for a slightly greater acceleration over the ﬁrst
10 m, and is a more realistic assumption than having a constant A.

The important of an ambient wind in a sprint race is exempliﬁed by this
term, since its magnitude is a function of (v(t) − w)2. Any non-zero tail-
wind reduces the eﬀective drag experience by the sprinter, allowing him/her
greater acceleration, a greater top speed, and hence a faster overall time. A
positive wind-speed corresponds to a tail-wind (i.e. wind in the direction of
motion of the sprinter), while a negative wind-speed denotes a head-wind.
The IAAF (International Amateur Athletic Federation) has adopted a limit
of +2.0 ms−1 for a supporting wind, above which a race is deemed “wind-
assisted” [10]. Since such times are not recognized as legal performances,
they cannot be ratiﬁed as World Records.

4

Wind-speed has the dominant eﬀect on drag, but an additional factor

which aﬀects this term is the atmospheric density, ρ(H), where

ρ(H) = ρ0 exp(−0.000125 H) .

(8)

Here, ρ0 = 1.184 gm−3 is the sea-level density at 25 degrees Celsius, and
H is the measured elevation/altitude (in metres) (Dapena and Feltner [16]
propose a second-order-in-H correction to the altitude, which is not included
here).

Races which are run at altitudes above H = 1000 m are deemed altitude-
assisted, but unlike wind-assisted marks, these can be ratiﬁed as records. For
example, at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City (H ≈ 2250 m), World Records
were set in both the 100 m and 200 m dashes, thanks to the considerable
altitude (the density of air in Mexico City is roughly 76% of ρ0). Pietro
Mennea’s former 200 m record of 19.72 s was also set at altitude. Further-
more, the fastest-ever recorded 100 m clocking is 9.69 seconds by Obadele
Thompson of Barbados, in April 1996 (at which time the oﬃcial World
Record was 9.85 s). This race was run in El Paso, Texas (H ≈ 1300 m) with
a tail-wind of +5.7 ms−1. Thompson’s previous 100 m performances were
all slower than 10.00 s, which serves to demonstrate the extremal beneﬁts
of drag reduction.

3 Model parameters and simulation results

The coupled equations (3) and ˙d(t) = v(t) cannot be solved analytically, so
one must resort to numerical methods. Thanks to the signiﬁcant increase
in modern processor speeds, the values of the parameters (f0, σ); (f1, c); α;
Ad can be rapidly isolated. This was done using a fourth-ﬁfth order Runge-
Kutta integration scheme (written in C) run on a 500 MHz Pentium III
processor supporting Linux 6.0. An iterative time-step of 0.001 s was chosen
for the integration.

In order to determine extremal parameters for the model, key 10 m split
data for several world class 100 m races are matched. Such data has been
obtained at various world-class track meets, including the 1997 and 1999
World Championships in Athletics [11, 12], as well as the 1988 Olympic
Games [6]. The instantaneous velocity splits obtained in [11] were measured
with a laser-based device known as a LAVEG, which collects its data by
sensing the reﬂectivity of 20 ns, 904 nm pulses directed at a (linearly) re-
ceding target. The cited reliability of the distance measurements is ±1 cm,
at a sampling rate of up to 100 measurements per second [13].

5

After repeated numerical runs and adjustments to the parameters, the

following set was obtained:

(f0, σ) = (6.10, 2.22);

(f1, c, α) = (5.15, 0.0385, 0.3225);

Ad = 0.002875;

Also, w = 0.0 ms−1; H = 0 m. The simulation results are displayed in
Table 1, and yield a raw (i.e. excluding reaction3) time of 9.70 s, with a
maximum velocity of 11.845 ms−1 at 59.18 m. Such ﬁgures are in agreement
with actual world class sprinters running sub-9.90 second races to better
than ±0.01 s, with the instantaneous velocity splits also matching to within
1 % of the actual value (see e.g. the data in [11]).

Of course, each individual sprinter would most likely be described by a
unique set of parameters, and such a task is not within the immediate scope
of this paper. Also, due to the nature of the drag term (7), the eﬀects of
cross-winds are not considered in the current form of the model.

The drive-phase correction (4) is necessary to accurately reproduce the
observed velocity proﬁle over the ﬁrst 30-40 metres. For example, the ve-
locity proﬁles presented in [4] for sprinter Donovan Bailey of Canada give
9.32 ms−1 (10 m), 10.95 ms−1 (20 m), 11.67 ms−1 (30 m), and 11.99 ms−1
(40 m). These velocity ﬁgures are doubtful, in light of the proﬁles presented
by actual split data [11].
It is unlikely that Bailey achieved a speed of
11.99 ms−1 as early as 40 m, and furthermore sustained speeds in excess of
12 ms−1 for an additional 40 m [4].

3.1 Wind assistance: determination of the drag coeﬃcient

and frontal cross-sectional area

The value of Ad is isolated in conjunction with the measured eﬀect of wind
assistance by past authors [2, 14, 15], most of whom agree that a tail-wind
of +2.0 ms−1 will boost a 10 s 100 m sprint by about 0.1 s. The results of an
earlier study [16] cite corrections of −0.07 s for a +2 ms−1 wind, although
one of the authors has since produced updated results which are more com-
mensurate with the literature [17]. Table 1 also shows the eﬀects of such a
tail-wind on the predicted 100 m times, and accordingly predicts a boost of
0.104s. Conversely, a head-wind of equal magnitude (w = −2.0 ms−1) will
increase the time by 0.130 s to 9.830 s. Clearly, the non-linear nature of

3Although they depend on the individual athlete and the conditions at the time of the
race, reaction times tend to range between 0.12 − 0.17 s. Reaction times below 0.100 s are
not allowed, as it is believed that it is not physiologically possible to surpass this limit.

6

the drag term implies that equal but opposite wind speeds will not provide
equal boosts. It is reasonable to assume that there could be mild variations
in these corrections, depending on variations in Ad, but a full study of this
eﬀect is not the aim of this paper.

For a sprinter of mass 80 kg, the value Ad = 0.002875 indicates that the
eﬀective drag area is A·Cd = 0.23 m2. Note that this is slightly less than the
0.3 m2 estimate of Linthorne [18]. For a cross-sectional area between 0.40 −
0.50 m2, this suggests that the drag coeﬃcient is between 0.46 and 0.57.
Note that it may actually be erroneous to assume that the drag coeﬃcient
is constant, since the could potentially be frequent transitions to laminar
ﬂow occurring throughout the race. Also, the drag area may vary slightly
from athlete to athlete.

It should be noted that while these simulation times are recorded to
0.001 seconds, oﬃcial race times are reported to only 0.01 s, and oﬃcial
wind gauge readings to 0.1 ms−1.
In actual fact, electronic/photo-ﬁnish
timing is recorded to 0.001 s, and the following “rounding-up” algorithm
is applied to the times: unless the third decimal place is 0, the hundredth
position is rounded up. For example, Canadian sprinters Donovan Bailey
and Bruny Surin have both recorded 100 m times of 9.84 s, but their pre-
rounded times were actually 9.835 s and 9.833 s respectively [15]. A time
of 9.831 s would be reported as 9.84 s, while 9.830 s would earn a 9.83 s
rounding.

The reported value is measured from a gauge of height no more than
1.22 m, placed within 2 m from lane 1 on the in-ﬁeld at a distance of 50 m
from the ﬁnish line. The wind-speed is sampled for a duration of 10 s from
the start of the race [10]. Wind speeds are measured to 0.01 ms−1, but are
rounded in a similar fashion. However, Linthorne [19] has recently noted that
measuring the wind speed in such a fashion gives an error of ± 0.7 ms−1 on
the actual value. Such a discrepancy would certainly impact the validity of
the reported times.

3.2 Altitude eﬀects

Although altitude eﬀects are secondary insofar as drag modiﬁcation is con-
cerned, their inﬂuence is not negligible. Table 2 demonstrates the modiﬁca-
tions to the times of Table 1, subject to an increasing elevation. Non-zero
wind eﬀects are not included, but will be discussed in detail later on. The
model predicts an advantage of 0.069 seconds from sea level to a 2000 me-
tre elevation. For a “Mexico City” altitude (approximately 2250 m), the
correction to this 100 m time (with no wind) would be 0.075 s, in rough

7

agreement with the predictions of Linthorne [14] and Dapena [17]. It should
be noted that the correction ﬁgures given in Reference [15] are considered
to be overestimated, due to an inaccurate value of the drag area.

3.3 Graphical analysis of propulsive forces

While hypothesized from a mathematical basis, the quasi-physical model
herein provides accurate matches to real data. A study of the propulsive
forces reveals a striking agreement to that presented by Dapena and Felt-
ner [16]. Although their analysis is for 10.90 s-caliber sprinters, the ﬁgures
presented herein for sub-10 s sprinters show the same overall structure. The
authors suggest that a plot of mass-normalized propulsive force versus the
athlete’s velocity can be modeled by two straight lines, adjoined at a “bound-
ary velocity” roughly 3-5 ms−1 less than maximum.

Figure 5 demonstrates the identical analysis for the model parameters
listed in Section 3. Unlike Dapena and Feltner’s model, the acceleration is
highly non-linear before 4 ms−1, at which point it assumes a roughly linear
form to about 7 ms−1. The “boundary velocity” in this case is representa-
tive of the point where the drive term fd has dropped to roughly 10 % of
its original value (about 1 second into the race). At this point, the curve
assumes another linear form of diﬀering slope, before approaching the max-
imum velocity (and again diverging from linearity).

Such an analysis can in fact be used to rule out the Keller model and its
variants. Although Keller’s value of F was in the 12.1 ms−2 range [2], the
overall form of the function does not provide an adequate global match.

Similarly, using Tibshirani’s modiﬁcation [3], the statistical ﬁt of race
data from Donovan Bailey’s 1996 Olympic 100 m race [4] predicted an initial
f (0) = F value of 7.96 (Tibshirani’s own analysis predicted a lower value
of 6.41, almost half that of Keller). These models are also presented in
Figure 5, and are representative of roughly a 9.8-10 second race. On their
own these two approximations do not support the predictions of the quasi-
physical model, however it is interesting to note that Keller’s model before,
and the Tibshirani-Mureika model after their intersection are a rough ﬁrst-
order approximation to the data.
In fact, this is similar to linear model
proposed in [16].

3.4 Assistance for women sprinters

Women sprinters are certainly lighter than an average 80 kg, yet their cross-
sectional area is correspondingly smaller. Similarly, their stride rates tend to

8

be lower. Thus, a ﬁrst-pass approximation for women can be made by a mild
adjustment to the parameters of Equation (3). Following the interpretation
of Section 2.3, a lower stride rate can be taken to correspond to higher α.
Similarly, adjustments to the propulsive terms are reasonably made.

By setting f0 = 5.60; f1 = 4.57; c = 0.037; α = 0.32, and Ad = 0.00275 m2
(which corresponds to a drag area of 0.18 m2 for a mass of 65 kg), one can
reproduce splits which roughly replicate those observed by world class fe-
male sprinter Marion Jones (see [11]), and match the predicted wind and
altitude advantages of [17] and [14]. For the cited drag area, a drag coeﬃ-
cient between 0.5-0.6 would require a cross-sectional area of 0.30-0.36 m2,
roughly 80% that of men (a reasonable approximation).

Using these values gives a raw time of 10.653 s. At sea-level (H = 0 m),
an advantage of 0.117 s is predicted for a tail-wind of +2.0 ms−1 (10.536 s),
and 0.086 s for H = 2500 m. These ﬁgures are again in close agreement with
those of [17] and Linthorne [14], who predicts a correction of 0.12 ± 0.02 s.
A wind of −2.0 ms−1 at H = 0 m will increase the time to 10.802 s, a
diﬀerence of 0.149 s.

Figures 1,2,3, and 4 give performance corrections for men and women,
for altitudes ranging between H = 0 − 2500 m. The sign of the correction
indicates the impact of the associated wind and altitude on the base time t0
at 0 m altitude and 0-wind, i.e. ∆t = tw −t0. A negative correction indicates
that the time tw is faster than the base (e.g. for tail winds), and vice versa
(note the change in sign relative to the Tables). The predicted corrections
for women cannot be applied to slower men’s races, since the assumed drag
area is much lower. If the modiﬁed drag area is kept as 0.002875 m2kg−1,
the resulting boost is 0.122 s for a +2.0 ms−1 wind and a lapse of 0.154 s
for a −2.0 ms−1 wind.

4 Sensitivity to parameter variation

4.1 Correction for late-race velocity drop-oﬀ

The measured velocity data presented in Reference [11] indicate that the
model predictions drop oﬀ faster than the measured data for the latter half
of the race. It should be noted that this discrepancy can be accounted for
by lowering the power of t in maintenance term (5), and hence the overall
shape of the associated “energy envelope”. In fact, the author notes that
a substitution t → tβ, with β ∼ 0.95 − 0.98 (and mild adjustments to f1)
provides a closer match to the data.

While such modiﬁcations are of interest to providing a fully realistic

9

simulation, variation of this parameter is an over-complication of an already-
intricate model, and is not essential for the study conducted herein. A
full study of such time dependence is postponed for future work, and in
particular its implications for the 200 m dash are discussed in [5].

Furthermore, it was noted that variation of the (f1, α, c) parameters did
not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the velocity proﬁle in the early part of the race, but
could be used to adjust the late-race proﬁle. Individual adjustments of these
parameters to produce a 0.1 s advantage in the ﬁnal time presented minimal
eﬀects on the proﬁle for d < 50 m. Conceivably, individual athletes could
be represented by their own set of parameters, which could help account for
variability in observed race times. Despite these minor velocity adjustments
over 60-100 m, a +2.0 ms−1 assisting wind again provided boosts between
0.101 − 0.103 s.

4.2 Slow starts and the time dependence of fs

It is possible to use the model to simulate “slow starts” by suitable read-
justment of the drive term parameters.
In fact, by modifying the time-
dependence of Equation 4, one may reproduce starts in which athletes did
not accelerate as quickly as others, but achieved higher overall velocities at
each split in the earlier portions of the race.

Figure 6 demonstrates such a simulation, with adjusted time-dependence
fd = f1 exp(−σ t), and σ = 1.68, as compared to the simulation of Section 3.
The simulated splits are shown in Table 4; such data is consistent in pro-
ﬁle with those of Canadian sprinter Donovan Bailey from the 1997 World
Championships in Athens [11]. One can note this simulation lags behind
the other until about 70 metres, although achieving higher maximal veloc-
ities. In this case, the ﬁnish is within 0.005 seconds. This type of behavior
is frequently observable at any competition, and is characteristic of many
famous world class sprinters (including the aforementioned Bailey, as well
as American track legend Carl Lewis).

5 Variable wind speeds

As mentioned previously, the wind speeds are sampled for a period of 10 sec-
onds following the start of the race, after which the average value of the
wind-speed is taken as the oﬃcial gauge reading. The examples cited pre-
viously have assumed that the wind velocity is constant. However, this is
probably more of ideal situation than not. A more realistic scenario is one

10

in which the wind speed is variable, but averages out to a value which may
be unrepresentative of the true conditions.

Following the example of Dapena and Feltner [16], the results of a
variable-wind race are given in Table 3. Four separate variability condi-
tions are simulated, with the constraint that the gauge reading (i.e. the
mean wind velocity over 10 seconds) be the legal limit of +2.0 ms−1. These
conditions include:

1. Step function: w(t) = 4 Θ(t − 5)

2. Step function: w(t) = 4[1 − Θ(t − 5)]

3. Linear: w(t) = 2/5 t

4. Linear: w(t) = 2/5 (10 − t)

Here, Θ(t) is the Heavyside function, with Θ(t − t0) = 0 ∀t < t0, and
Θ(t − t0) = 1 otherwise. The time-averaged wind-speed is calculated in the

usual fashion, ¯w = T −1 R T

0 w(t) dt, with T = 10 seconds.

While the constant tail-wind speed of +2.0 ms−1 predicts a boost of
0.104 s for the present model, the above conditions predict a rather large
range of variation. Cases 1 and 3 show the smallest advantages, due to
minimal (or zero) wind conditions in the drive phase (hence lower overall
accelerations in the ﬁrst half of the race). These cases also show the lowest
peak velocities in this boost scenario, although still lower than the constant
wind case. Note that the peak velocities occur much later than in the base
case and the constant-wind case.

Case 4 shows a peak velocity at roughly the same location as in the base
9.700 s run (a diﬀerence of only 19 cm), although with a much higher mag-
nitude (+0.182 ms−1). Case 2, on the other hand, shows almost the same
velocity, but at a much earlier mark (54.95 m). This decidedly premature
maximum is no doubt due to the overpowering contributions of the velocity
term fv once the assisting tail-wind has subsided. The sprinter is physically
unable to achieve a higher velocity.

Dapena and Feltner only consider Cases 1 and 2 in their analysis (for the
time-averaged +2 ms−1 wind). However, it is interesting that the predictions
of this model in fact are opposite of their assertions. For Case 1, they predict
a boost of 0.066 s, while their Case 2 shows a boost of 0.060 s, both lower
than their constant-wind case (0.070 s). The conditions of Case 1 and Case 3
allow the maximum velocity to be achieved later in the race, which may not
have an issue addressed by the authors in question. Their underestimation

11

of the initial boost may also be a contributing factor, and adjustment of their
parameters to suit the current estimates of Dapena [17] may yield diﬀering
results. Whether this is a false estimate in the ﬁgures of Dapena and Feltner
or a short-coming of the current model is an open question. Observation of
this velocity-limitation could yield credibility to form of fv.

Certainly, such wind speed variations considered in this section can fur-
ther contribute to small velocity discrepancies between the model with con-
stant wind speed, as well as variations in the actual race splits.

5.1 Variable 0-wind average

The analysis above begs the question: what kind of performance variations
could be expected for a time-averaged wind speed of 0 ms−1? Table 5 demon-
strates such potential discrepancies, with linear and sinusoidally-varying
wind speed functions (the unrealistic step functions are omitted here). The
linear winds simply range from equal-but-opposite maximum/minimum val-
ues (with 0 ms−1 occurring at the 5 s midpoint), the cosine functions begin
and end at the indicated maximum and minimum, and the sine functions
achieve a the maximum indicated with 0 ms−1-endpoints. Absolute maxima
of 2 and 4 ms−1 are chosen.

The simulations for the 2 ms−1 absolute wind show variations between
0.034 s slower and +0.023 s faster than the actual 0 ms−1 wind-speed val-
ues of Table 1.
Interestingly enough, the greatest advantage comes from
a cosine wind which begins and ends as a head-wind, the form of which
allows for greater acceleration through middle of the race. Conversely, the
greatest disadvantage is from the equivalent negative-cosine wind. As the
overall extremum of the wind increases, the diﬀerences become more acute
(although note a much higher disadvantage when the wind is negative from
about 30 m onward). Figure 7 presents the velocity proﬁles of several of
these variable conditions, compared to the base case of Section 3.

6 Comparison to previous wind-correction estimates

Recently, a “back-of-the-envelope” expression for potential wind and alti-
tude corrections was obtained in [20]:

t0,0 ≈ h1.027 − 0.027 exp(−0.00125 H) (1 − w · tw,H/100)2i tw ,

(9)

Here, tw,H is the oﬃcial race time (run with wind w at altitude H), and
t0,0 the time for w = 0 ms−1 at sea level. This is derived in part from

12

Equation 7 by selecting a constant propulsive force, and an average velocity
v = 100/tw,H . The assumption is made that a sprinter expends roughly
δ = 2.7% of his/her energy ﬁghting drag at sea level. For non-zero w, H, δ ∼
ρ(H)Ad(vw,H − w)2. The eﬀects of wind are thus calculated by assuming the
adjusted drag impacts the sprinter’s velocity by the ratio of forces F (vw,H −
w)/F (v0), where v0,0 ≃ 100/t0,0 is the average velocity at sea level with no
wind for a race-time t0,0, with vw,H = 100/tw,H the wind/altitude-inﬂuenced
velocity/time.

This ready-to-use expression provides a good match to the predictions
of this model, as well as those of Dapena [17] and Linthorne [14]. Table 6
demonstrates the corrective potential of Equation (9) subject to the model
parameters of Section 3. Note that the approximation becomes slightly
worse for increasing absolute wind speeds, however the magnitude of these
variations is less than 0.5% for w ∈ [−5, +5] ms−1. Such errors can certainly
be accounted for by mis-estimations of the input variables.

The mismatch may also result from the constant velocity assumption in
the derivation. The interested reader is referred to [20] for the complete
derivation.

7 What would have been the 100 m world record

in 1988?

On September 24th at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, Ben Johnson of Canada
clocked an astounding 100 metre World Record time of 9.79 s, bettering his
previous record of 9.83 s. Although this mark (and most of Johnson’s other
records) were stricken from the books due to the infamous steroid scandal
which followed, the Seoul mark did not reﬂect the true potential of this
remarkable athlete. At about 15 m from the ﬁnish line, Johnson looked over
his shoulder to gauge his lead over American Carl Lewis, and then raised
his arm in victory as he coasted through the remained of the race. The
question lingers: what would have been his World Record time, had he not
“stopped” at about 85 m?

The model discussed herein can be used to obtain projections of his
potential performances. Since no instantaneous velocity data is available
for this race, the parameters in Equation 3 are selected to match the 10 m
splits. Table 7 shows these values (obtained from [6]), along with two sample
simulations. The measured wind-speed of the race was w = +1.1 ms−1, and
the modiﬁed drag area is kept as in Section 3. The elevation of Seoul is
roughly that of sea level, so altitude corrections will be minimal in this case.

13

Eﬀectively, Johnson could have lowered his previous record by almost
0.1s, a quantum leap in the event. Depending on the chosen parameters,
the simulations predict times in the range of 9.60-9.62s, which round to
about 9.73-9.75s once reaction time is included. In this case, two sets are
selected to match the recorded splits, with the parameter values the same
as in Section 3, except variation in the values of (f0, f1). The modiﬁed
values are (f0 = 6.20; f1 = 5.16) (Simulation 1), and (f0 = 6.18; f1 = 5.17)
(Simulation 2). Note that the maximum velocity of the simulations do not
exceed 12 ms−1. While Johnson may have slightly topped this value in the
real race, he most certainly did not achieve 13.1 ms−1, a feat periodically
attributed to him [21].

In 1999, American Maurice Greene reset the World Record to 9.79 s
during a race in Athens, Greece. Up to slight variations in altitude, the city
is also at sea level, where the wind gauge read a calm +0.1 ms−1. Adjusting
this variable in the Johnson simulations, the time is scaled down to about
9.665 s (9.797 s after reaction) for Simulation 1, and 9.653 s for Simulation 2.
(9.785 s after reaction). Thus, Johnson’s former World Record would have
eﬀectively been equal to the 9.79 s set in 1999 by Greene.

8 General conclusions and future considerations

The quasi-physical model considered herein provides a good match to mea-
sured split data, particularly in the drive phase of the race. The wind and
altitude corrections for both men and women are consistent with those pro-
posed by previous authors, although this models yields stronger deviations
from the norm for variable wind conditions. If this type of scenario occurs
in a real competition, then the times may appear much faster (or slower)
than expect from the measured (time-averaged) wind.

Upon comparison with the previous theoretical estimates and comple-
mentary ﬁeld studies, it is clear that this model is both a realistic represen-
tation of short-sprint races, as well as a useful tool which can assist in the
physiological and biomechanical study of the sport.

A forthcoming manuscript [5] will discuss the eﬀects of wind and altitude

assistance in the 200 metre dash.

ABSTRACT

I give a brief non-technical review of “Quantum Grav-
ity Phenomenology” and in particular I describe some
studies which should soon allow to establish valuable
data-based constraints on the short-distance struc-
ture of spacetime.

The “quantum-gravity problem” has been studied for
more than 70 years, but we still do not have a sin-
gle experimental result whose interpretation requires
us to advocate a quantum theory of gravity. The
search of a ﬁrst case in which data provide some ev-
idence of a quantum property of spacetime is at this
point understandably characterized by a certain anx-
iety. Even the status of this research as a truly scien-
tiﬁc endeavor could be questioned if the present lack
of confrontation with experiments persists. And it
does not help that one can still encounter in the lit-
erature (although it is fortunately becoming increas-
ingly rare) some descriptions of the “quantum-gravity
problem” that are not of the type that one expects
in introducing a truly scientiﬁc problem. For exam-
ple, as motivation for reseach in quantum gravity it
is sometimes mentioned that it is unsatisfactory to
have on one side our present description of electro-
magnetic, weak and strong forces, uniﬁed within the
Standard Model of particle physics, which is a quan-
tum ﬁeld theory, and on the other side gravity de-
scribed by General Relativity, which is governed by
the very diﬀerent rules of classical mechanics.

This type of “human discomfort”, this type of ur-
gency to correct the lack of elegance of our present
worldview, does not of course deﬁne a scientiﬁc prob-
lem. But there is a well-deﬁned scientiﬁc prob-
lem which can be naturally called “quantum-gravity
problem”. This is the problem of obtaining quanti-
tative predictions for processes in which both grav-
ity eﬀects and Standard-Model eﬀects cannot be ne-
glected. The (quantum) Standard Model of parti-
cle physics has been hugely successful in describing
the microscopic phenomena involving fundamental
particles, where gravity can be ignored, and (clas-
sical) General Relativity has been equally success-
ful in describing the motions of macroscopic bodies,
whose quantum and Standard-Model properties can
be safely neglected. We have no available data on
situations in which neither can be neglected, but we
already know that we would not be able to describe
those data with our current theories, because some
logical and mathematical inconsistecies are encoun-
tered even before getting to the point of obtaining
a numerical prediction for these processes. Like two
pieces of diﬀerent jigsaw puzzles General Relativity

and the Standard Model cannot be merged without
modiﬁcation.

What would happen if we managed to collide two
photons each with energy of, say, 1050eV ? This is
a typical question to which we are unable to provide
even a tentative answer. According to our present
theories there should not be anything peculiar in the
setup of such a collision (just a higher-energy ver-
sion of the collisions we already set up at CERN
and other laboratories), but then those same theories
do not allow us to obtain a consistent prediction for
the outcome of the collision. One might argue that
1050eV photons should be the least of our concerns,
since we are never going to be able to produce and/or
observe them, but in cosmology there are some key
issues which require the understanding of ultra-high-
energy processes. Moreover, the fact that our the-
ories fail to generate consistent predictions in some
hard-to-produce contexts makes us concerned in gen-
eral about the robustness of these theories. Since we
know that new elements would have to be introduced
in our theories for the description of ultra-high-energy
processes, it is natural then to wonder whether those
new elements can aﬀect also some contexts in which
our present theories do appear to make sense, con-
texts that perhaps are more reacheable than, say, the
one of 1050eV photons.

The fact that we know so little about the quantum-
gravity problem has a simple explanation. One of the
few (perhaps the only) relatively robust hints that we
have about quantum gravity is that our conventional
description of spacetime should start to break down
at the Planck length Lp ∼ 10−35m (which can be also
described as the inverse of the Planck energy scale
Ep ∼ 1028eV ). At this scale, gravitational interac-
tions between particles are no longer negligible. And,
based on our experiences in other similar situations,
we expect that this scale should also dictate how big
the eﬀects in the new quantum-gravity theory will be:
for example in processes involving two particles both
with wavelength λ the magnitude of the new eﬀects
should be set by some power of the ratio between the
Planck length and the characteristic wavelength of
the process Lp/λ. Since in all cases accessible to us

experimentally Lp/λ is extremely small, it is not sur-
prising that the quantum-gravity eﬀects are nearly
inevitably negligible.

While we lack any experimental
insight on the
it is undeniable that
quantum-gravity problem,
quantum-gravity research has produced some results
that appear to be relevant for the solution of the
problem.
If nothing else, some theory results over
the last few decades have changed signiﬁcantly our
intuition. For example, results obtained in string the-
ory [1] provide encouragement for the idea that quan-
tum gravity could admit a perturbative treatment, at
least in certain contexts. Before these string-theory
results it appeared that quantum gravity should in
all cases be treated using (to-be-determined) nonper-
turbative techniques, with obvious associated diﬃ-
culties. The Loop Quantum Gravity [2, 3] research
programme has looked at the problem from a comple-
mentary perspective, and its development provides
encouragement for the idea that a truly background-
spacetime-independent quantum theory can be con-
structed. Before these studies it appeared that
there would be a more profound conﬂict between the
background-spacetime independence of general rela-
tivity and the fact that quantum ﬁeld theory assumes
from the start a background spacetime. Another ex-
ample of a change of intuition comes from research
on certain types of noncommutative spacetimes (see
later in these notes and Refs. [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]), which
were the ﬁrst examples of quantum spacetimes in
which it appeared plausible that the Planck scale
might aﬀect some of the familiar spacetime symme-
tries, most notably Lorentz symmetry.

Unfortunately, Loop Quantum Gravity can only be
treated (so far) as a fundamentally nonperturbative
theory, without access to the tools of perturbative
analysis which are so valuable when we attempt to
obtain quantitative predictions. And on the other
hand (in spite of recent advances [1]) we do not have
a genuinely background-independent formulation of
string theory (which, I expect, should introduce an
a priori limitation to the class of conceivable mea-
surement procedures for which string theory can pro-
vide consistent predictions). The development of
approaches to the quantum-gravity problem based

2

on noncommutative geometry is at an even earlier
stage of development, since we do not even have, at
present, a compelling candidate for “noncommuta-
tivegeometrodynamics” (a generalization of General
Relativity that could apply to noncommutative ge-
ometries). Some of these (and other) unsolved is-
sues are present in all approaches to the quantum-
gravity problem, and of course the fact that these
approaches have had no experimental success so far
keeps them in the limbo of purely theoretical spec-
ulations. But ﬁnally we have some quantum-gravity
approaches which are developed to a point where it
appears plausible that they might have managed to
capture at least some features of the correct theory.
The history of the development of physics tells us that
in many cases theories which ended up not giving a
full solution of the problem of interest nevertheless
managed to provide the right intuition for certain as-
pects of the full solution.

In attempting to proﬁt from these hints coming from
theory we are of course faced with the mentioned
problem of the smallness of the expected eﬀects, due
to the smallness of the Planck length. For decades it
had been assumed that such small eﬀects could never
be seen, but recently some strategies for overcoming
the challenges posed by the smallness of the eﬀects
have been developed. The type of strategy which is
used in this “Quantum Gravity Phenomenology” [10]
can be described in analogy with certain experimen-
tal studies of proton stability. The prediction of pro-
ton decay in granduniﬁed theories of particle physics
is really a small eﬀect, suppressed by the fourth power
of the ratio between the mass of the proton and the
granduniﬁcation scale (an energy scale which should
be only some three orders of magnitude smaller than
the Planck energy scale). In spite of this horrifying
suppression, with a simple idea we have managed to
acquire remarkable sensitivity to the new eﬀect: we
keep under observation a large number of protons, so
that, although the probability of decay of any given
proton is very small, the probability that one of the
many monitored protons would decay is observably
large.

Analogously in Quantum Gravity Phenomenology we
should focus on experiments which probe spacetime

structure and host an ordinary-physics dimensionless
quantity large enough that (like the number of mon-
itored protons in proton-stability studies) it could
amplify the extremely small eﬀects we hope to dis-
cover. And, using this strategy, over the last few
years several research lines within Quantum Gravity
Phenomenology have been developed.

Perhaps the most exciting of these research lines
are the ones connected with the idea of a “quan-
tum spacetime”.
In unifying general relativity and
quantum mechanics it is of course natural to con-
template the idea that space-time itself is quantized.
In ordinary quantum mechanics the space that con-
tains the three components of a particle’s angular
momentum is a “quantum space”: one cannot make
“sharp” (error-free) measurements of more than one
of the components of angular momentum (“angular-
momentum non-commutativity”), and a sharp mea-
surement of a single component can take only cer-
tain discrete values (“angular-momentum discretiza-
tion”).
Similarly one may expect that quantum
gravity should lead to spacetime noncommutativity
and/or spacetime discretization.
Space-time non-
commutativity would, in its simplest form, prevent
one from making error-free measurements of more
than one of the coordinates of a point in space-
time. And if spacetime were discrete certain sharp
spacetime measurements (of, say, volume or one of
a point’s coordinates) could then take only certain
discrete values.

String Theory does not necessarily lead to spacetime
quantization, at least in the sense that its background
spacetime is commonly taken as a classical geometry.
I fear that the assumption of a classical background
spacetime may point to an incompleteness of String
Theory. In fact, the formalism eventually leads to the
emergence of a fundamental limitation on the local-
ization of a spacetime event (see, e.g., Refs. [11, 12]),
and this might be in conﬂict with the assumption of
a physically-meaningful classical background space-
time (whose points acquire operative meaning only if
they can be sharply localized). In any case (even as-
suming that a classical spacetime background should
be acceptable for String Theory) it has been found
that under appropriate conditions (a vacuum expec-
tation value for certain tensor ﬁelds) it is appropriate

commutative spacetime [9].

In Loop Quantum Gravity spacetime is inherently
discretized [13] and this occurs in a rather compelling
way: it is not that one introduces by hand an a priori
discrete background spacetime; it is rather a case in
which a background-independent analysis ultimately
leads, by a sort of self-consistency, to the emergence
of spacetime discretization. Moreover, some recent
results [14, 15] could open the way for a role for
noncommutative spacetimes also in the description
of some aspects of Loop Quantum Gravity.

A description of space-time that is “fundamentally
quantum” (quantized, in the sense of noncommuta-
tivity and/or discretization, even at the level of the
background geometry) would require a profound re-
newal of fundamental physics. In particular, it should
naturally have striking implications for the propaga-
tion of particles. As usual in quantum gravity, we
expect that these eﬀects would be very small, char-
acterized by the Planck scale. A useful analogy is the
one of the surface of a wooden table. We usually per-
ceive the surface of the table as perfectly ﬂat, but this
ﬂatness is the result of some sort of averaging over the
short-distance irregularities of the table’s surface. If
we take a ball with diameter much larger than the
short-distance scale of roughness of the table surface
and roll it over the surface, we ﬁnd no evidence of the
roughness, but if we use a ball whose diameter is not
much larger than the scale of roughness we will see
disturbances in the path of the ball due to the rough-
ness. Similarly, a quantization of spacetime at the
Planck scale can aﬀect the propagation of particles,
in a way that depends on the “size” (wavelength) of
the particles. In several recently-studied scenarios for
spacetime quantization (most notably in Loop Quan-
tum Gravity [2, 16] and in noncommutative space-
times [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]),
it has been shown that the
“dispersion relation” between energy, E, and momen-
tum, p, acquires energy/wavelength-dependent cor-
instead of the familiar classical-spacetime
rections:

dispersion relations (such as the case of the study of the prop-

One context in which spacetime quantization can
have observably large implications is the one of ultra-
high-energy cosmic rays. According to the present
understanding, cosmic rays are emitted by distant
active galaxies and produce showers of elementary
particles when they pass through the Earth’s atmo-
sphere. Before reaching our Earth detectors cos-
mic rays travel gigantic (cosmological) distances and
could interact with photons in the cosmic microwave
background. These interactions, which can cause en-
ergy loss through photopion production, are kine-
matically forbidden at low energies, but they are
very eﬃcient when the cosmic-ray energy is above
the photopion-production energy threshold Eth. This
leads to the expectation that by the time they reach
the Earth a cosmic ray should have energy which does
not exceed signiﬁcantly Eth. However, the estimate
of Eth depends very sensitively on the structure of
the dispersion relation. Even a minute Planck-scale
modiﬁcation of the dispersion relation can induce a
signiﬁcant shift of the cosmic-ray threshold. Adopt-
ing the familiar E2 = p2+m2 one obtains an estimate
of the cosmic-ray threshold that appears to be too low
in comparison with the observations reported by the
AGASA cosmic-ray observatory in Japan. Planck-
scale modiﬁed dispersion relations can instead natu-
rally ﬁt [19, 20, 21] the AGASA data.

the
There are other plausible explanations
AGASA “cosmic-ray puzzle”, and even on the ex-
perimental side the situation must be considered as
preliminary while waiting for more powerful observa-
tories, such as Auger, in Argentina. Still, the pos-
sibility that in these cosmic-ray studies we might be
witnessing the ﬁrst manifestation of a quantum prop-
erty of spacetime is of course very exciting; more-
over, whether or not they end up being successful
in describing cosmic-ray observations, these analyses
provide an explicit example of a minute Planck-scale
eﬀect that can leave observable traces in actual data.

agation of light in certain crystals) are such that there is a
preferred frame, in quantum gravity it is conceivable that such
dispersion relations would emerge as observer-independent fea-
tures of spacetime structure [17]. I attempted to discuss this
point nontechnically in the recent paper in Ref. [18].

Besides the cosmic-ray threshold, another key impli-
cation of Planck-scale-modiﬁed dispersion relations
is the prediction that the time needed by a massless
particle to propagate over a given distance should
depend on the wavelength/energy of the particle. It
has been established [22, 23, 16] that observations
on gamma-ray bursts can be used to look for this
eﬀect. Gamma-ray bursts provide us clusters of pho-
tons emitted by the source roughly simultaneously,
with millisecond uncertainty2.
If there was even a
tiny (Planck-scale suppressed, as usual) dependence
of the speed of photons on their wavelength the fact
that these photons travel over huge cosmological dis-
tances would lead to a signiﬁcant correlation between
time of arrival on Earth and wavelength (a correlation
that, for photons with energies higher than 10M eV ,
could lead to an eﬀect which is signiﬁcant in com-
parison with the millisecond simultaneity available
at the source). The next generation of gamma-ray
telescopes, most notably the GLAST space telescope,
should allow a noteworthy investigation [24] of this
scenario.

These studies of Planck-scale deformations of the dis-
persion relation (studies based on observations of
cosmic rays and gamma-ray bursts) constitute the
best developed research line in quantum-gravity phe-
nomenology, but there are several other topics which
are under intense investigation. One noteworthy ex-
ample are studies of the popular quantum-gravity in-
tuition that at a fundamental level the concept of
distance should be “fuzzy”, it should be aﬀected by
unavoidable quantum ﬂuctuations. Spacetime non-
commutativity was introduced also as a possible way
to describe mathematically this intuition, but it re-
mains extremely hard to deduce from a given pro-
posal of spacetime noncommutativity the associated
picture of spacetime fuzziness.
In Loop Quantum
Gravity it is natural to expect such quantum ﬂuc-
tuations (whereas in String Theory this point might
be aﬀected by the a priori assumption of a classi-
cal background spacetime), but again there is still no
success in characterizing the eﬀect in a way that is
useful for experiments.

2Here I am actually thinking of a microburst, within the

whole gamma-ray-burst event [22].

This impasse on the theoretical front of course does
not prevent us from pursuing the issue experimen-
tally, although the phenomenology of course pays a
price for the lack of guidance from fundamental theo-
ries. Phenomenology of “distance fuzziness” has pri-
marily focused on its possible implications for inter-
ferometry. Conventional interferometry relies on the
assumption that there is a reference sharp (classical)
concept of length of the arms of the interferometer.
Preliminary studies in which the classical length is
replaced by a “fuzzy” length have considered both
atom interferometers [25] and laser-light interferom-
eters [26, 27]. These studies showed that it is not
unconceivable that small Planck-scale fuzzy-distance
eﬀects would be seen in the foreseeable future, but
since we are limited to purely phenomenological con-
siderations (because of the mentioned lack of guid-
ance from more developed quantum-gravity theories)
it is diﬃcult to have an intuition for the robustness
of the estimates.

Related analyses based on spacetime fuzziness, and
the associated subject of quantum-gravity-induced
decoherence, can also be performed in the context
of neutral-kaon experiments [28]. Instead of the high
precision of interferometry, these studies exploit an
experimental technique in which a crucial role is
played by the remarkable smallness of the mass diﬀer-
ence between the long-lived and the short-lived neu-
tral kaons. Also in this case purely-phenomenological
sensitivity analyses lead to tentatively encouraging
estimates, but so far there is no evidence of the eﬀect
in data [29].

typical

exercise of

The
the “quantum-gravity-
phenomenology community” is a situation in which
the smallness of the Planck scale is the key challenge.
But I should stress here that recently there has been
some work on the possibility that quantum gravity
might show up at lower energy scales. There is no
good reason for this to happen, but it is a possibil-
ity, and of course it should be explored. In particu-
lar, over these past few years there has been strong
interest in experiments looking for a key feature of
String Theory: the fact that its mathematical consis-
tency requires the existence of some extra spacetime
dimensions, in addition to the four we experience di-
rectly. It turns out to be rather natural to assume

5

that these extra dimensions be of ﬁnite Planck-length
size. For this most studied scenario for String The-
ory, in which the extra dimensions are, as expected
for typical quantum-gravity eﬀects, characterized by
the Planck length, all attempts to ﬁnd opportuni-
ties for experimental tests have failed. However, over
these past few years there has been interest [30] in the
possibility that some of the extra dimensions might
have a size which is much larger than the Planck
length. The most studied scenario assumes two large
extra dimensions and has been shown to lead to im-
portant eﬀects already at the level of classical grav-
ity, eﬀects which would be signiﬁcant in experimen-
tal studies of Newton’s 1/r2 law when the distance
r between two test masses is at or below the 10−4m
scale. Experiments looking for these eﬀects adopt
various strategies. For example, Newtonian gravity
predicts that there is no net force between a cylinder
and a cylindrical shell that surrounds it, but any devi-
ation from the inverse-square law would give rise to a
net force. Experiments looking for such a force have
improved signiﬁcantly over the last few years, but
we still have no evidence of departures from New-
ton’s inverse-square law even for distances down to
10−4m [31]. It is amusing that these classical-gravity
tests can provide an important hint on the quantum-
gravity problem, since the discovery of extra dimen-
sions would of course be of encouragement for String
Theory, which is the only known theory that requires
extra dimensions for its consistency.

In closing I want to stress that ﬁnally an experimental
programme for quantum gravity is starting to be de-
veloped, but it remains extremely diﬃcult. The fact
that String Theory and Loop Quantum Gravity have
matured to the point of providing us some guidance
concerning the nature of the eﬀects that might char-
acterize quantum gravity, and the recent advances in
noncommutative geometry (both as a fundamental
quantum picture of spacetime and as an eﬀective-
theory description of some aspects of String Theory
and Loop Quantum Gravity) have been very valuable
for Quantum Gravity Phenomenology. It is diﬃcult
to even attempt guessing where we might be in 15
or 20 years. By then we will know, through stud-
ies of cosmic rays and gamma-ray bursts, whether or

not there is a Planck-scale modiﬁed dispersion rela-
tion. If that response is negative perhaps one of the
other reasearch lines I here mentioned will stumble
upon the much needed ﬁrst experimental evidence of
a quantum property of spacetime. As usual in phe-
nomenology, no promises can be made concerning the
time needed for a ﬁrst discovery. But one goal that
Quantum Gravity Phenomenology will surely achieve
in the short term is the one of forcing the quantum-
gravity debate to focus on the potentially observable
aspects of any given quantum-gravity theory. For too
long this research had been in a limbo at the interface
between physics, mathematics and phylosophy. The
excuse for avoiding the diﬃculties of a more genuinely
scientiﬁc attitude toward the problem was provided
by the smallness of the Planck length. Now that we
are planning the ﬁrst few experiments with genuine
Planck-length sensitivity, we can no longer hang on
to our old excuse.

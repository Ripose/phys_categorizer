A ball can be hit faster if it is projected without spin but it can be hit farther if it is projected
with backspin. Measurements are presented in this paper of the tradeoﬀ between speed and spin
for a baseball impacting a baseball bat. The results are inconsistent with a collision model in which
the ball rolls oﬀ the bat and instead imply tangential compliance in the ball, the bat, or both. If the
results are extrapolated to the higher speeds that are typical of the game of baseball, they suggest
that a curveball can be hit with greater backspin than a fastball, but by an amount that is less than
would be the case in the absence of tangential compliance.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Particle scattering experiments have been con-
ducted for many years to probe the structure of the
atom, the atomic nucleus, and the nucleons. By
comparison, very few scattering experiments have
been conducted with macroscopic objects.
In this
paper we describe an experiment on the scattering
of a baseball by a baseball bat, not to probe the
structure of the bat but to determine how the speed
and spin of the outgoing ball depends on the scatter-
ing angle. In principle the results could be used to
determine an appropriate force law for the interac-
tion, but we focus attention in this paper on directly
observable parameters. The main purpose of the ex-
periment was to determine the amount of backspin
that can be imparted to a baseball by striking it at
a point below the center of the ball. The results
are of a preliminary nature in that they were ob-
tained at lower ball speeds than those encountered
in the ﬁeld. As such, the experiment could easily
be demonstrated in the classroom or repeated in an
undergraduate laboratory as an introduction to scat-
tering problems in general.

A golf ball is normally lofted with backspin so
that the aerodynamic lift force will carry the ball
as far as possible. For the same reason, a baseball
will also travel farther if it is struck with backspin.
It also travels farther if it is launched at a higher
In general there is a tradeoﬀ between the
speed.
spin and speed that can be imparted to a ball, which
is aﬀected in baseball by the spin and speed of the
pitched ball. Sawicki, et al.1, henceforth referred to
as SHS, examined this problem and concluded that
a curveball can be batted farther than a fastball de-

spite the higher incoming and outgoing speed of the
fastball. The explanation is that a curveball is in-
cident with topspin and hence the ball is already
spinning in the correct direction to exit with back-
spin. A fastball is incident with backspin so the spin
direction needs to be reversed in order to exit with
backspin. As a result, the magnitude of the backspin
imparted to a curveball is larger than that imparted
to a fastball for any given bat speed and impact
point on the bat, even allowing for the lower incident
speed of a curveball. According to SHS,1 the larger
backspin on a hit curveball more than compensates
the smaller hit ball speed and travels farther than
a fastball, a conclusion that has been challenged in
the literature.2

SHS1 assumed that a batted ball of radius r will
roll oﬀ the bat with a spin ω given by rω = vx
where vx is the tangential speed of the ball as
it exits the bat. However, a number of recent
experiments3,4,5,6,7 have shown that balls do not roll
when they bounce. Rather, a ball incident obliquely
on a surface will grip during the bounce and usu-
ally bounces with rω > vx if the angle of incidence
is within about 45◦ to the normal. The actual spin
depends on the tangential compliance or elasticity
of the mating surfaces and is not easy to calculate
accurately. For that reason we present in this pa-
per measurements of speed, spin and rebound angle
of a baseball impacting with a baseball bat. The
implications for batted ball speed and spin are also
described.

II. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

A baseball was dropped vertically onto a station-
ary, hand–held baseball bat to determine the re-
bound speed and spin as functions of (a) the scat-
tering angle and (b) the magnitude and direction of
spin of the incident ball. The impact distance from
the longitudinal axis of the bat was varied on a ran-
dom basis in order to observe scattering at angles up
to about 120◦ away from the vertical. Measurements
were made by ﬁlming each bounce with a video cam-
era operating at 100 frames/s, although satisfactory
results were also obtained at 25 frames/s. The bat
chosen for the present experiment was a modiﬁed
Louisville Slugger model R161 wood bat of length
84 cm (33 in.) with a barrel diameter of 6.67 cm (2
5
8 in.) and mass M = 0.989 kg (35 oz). The center of
mass of the bat was located 26.5 cm from the barrel
end of the bat. The moments of inertia about axes
through the center of mass and perpendicular and
parallel, respectively, to the longitudinal axis of the
bat were 0.0460 and 4.39 x 10−4 kg-m2. The ball
was a Wilson A1010, having a mass 0.145 kg and
diameter 7.2 cm.

The bat was held in a horizontal position by one
hand and the ball was dropped from a height of
about 0.8 m using the other hand. A plumb bob
was used to establish a true vertical in the video
image and to help align both the bat and the ball.
The ball was dropped either with or without spin.
In order to spin the ball, a strip of felt was wrapped
around a circumference and the ball was allowed to
fall vertically while holding the top end of the felt
strip. A line drawn around a circumference was used
to determine the ball orientation in each frame in or-
der to measure its spin. The impact distance along
the axis was determined by eye against marks on the
barrel to within about 5 mm. If the ball landed 140
to 160 mm from the barrel end of the bat the bounce
was accepted. Bounces outside this range were not
analyzed.

The velocity of the ball immediately prior to and
after impact was determined to within 2% by ex-
trapolating data from at least three video frames
before and after each impact. The horizontal ve-
locity was obtained from linear ﬁts to the horizon-
tal coordinates of the ball and the vertical velocity
was obtained from quadratic ﬁts assuming a verti-
cal acceleration of 9.8 m/s2. Additional measure-
ments were made by bouncing the ball on a hard

2

wood ﬂoor to determine the normal and tangential
COR, the latter deﬁned below in Eq. 1, and a lower
limit on the coeﬃcient of sliding friction (µk) be-
tween the ball and the ﬂoor. The COR values were
determined by dropping the ball with and without
spin from a height of about 1.5 m to impact the ﬂoor
at a speed of 5.6 ± 0.3 m/s. The incident ball spin
was either zero, −72 ± 2 rad/s or +68 ± 3 rad/s.
The normal COR ey was 0.59 ± 0.01, and the tan-
gential COR ex was 0.17 ± 0.03, corresponding to
a rebound spin ω2 ≈ 0.16ω1, where ω1 is the inci-
dent spin. If a spinning baseball is dropped verti-
cally onto a hard ﬂoor, then it would bounce with
ω2 = 0.29ω1 if ex = 0 (as assumed by SHS1). The
lower limit on µk was determined by throwing the
ball obliquely onto the ﬂoor at angles of incidence
between 25◦ and 44◦ to the horizontal, at speeds
from 3.5 to 4.2 m/s and with negligible spin. The
value of µk was found from the data at low angles of
incidence to be larger than 0.31 ± 0.02. At angles of
incidence between 30◦ and 44◦ the ball did not slide
throughout the bounce but gripped the ﬂoor during
the bounce, with ex = 0.14 ± 0.02.

In a low speed collision the bat and the ball
will remain approximately circular in cross section.
If the impact parameter is E, then the line joining
the bat and ball centers is inclined at an angle β to
the horizontal where cos β = E/(r + R). The ball
is incident at an angle θ1 = 90 − β to the line join-
ing the bat and ball centers and will rebound at an
angle θ2. The ball is therefore scattered at an angle
α = θ1+θ2. During the collision, the ball experiences
a tangential force F and a normal force N . For the
low-speed collisions investigated here, the ball-bat
force acts essentially at a point, so that the angular
momentum of the ball about that point is conserved.
Indeed, low-speed collisions of tennis balls are con-
sistent with angular momentum conservation.4 How-
ever, high-speed collisions of tennis balls are known
not to conserve angular momentum.5 A phenomeno-
logical way to account for non-conservation of angu-
lar momentum is to assume that the normal force
N does not act through the center of mass of the
ball but is displaced from it by the distance D,4 as
shown in Fig. 1 and discussed more fully below.

The collision is essentially equivalent to one be-
tween a ball and a plane surface inclined at angle
θ1 to the horizontal. Suppose that the ball is in-
cident with angular velocity ω1 and speed v1. Let
vy1 = v1 cos θ1 denote the component of the incident
ball speed normal to the surface and vx1 = v1 sin θ1
denote the tangential component. The ball will
bounce at speed vy2 in a direction normal to the sur-
face, with tangential speed vx2 and angular velocity
ω2. If the bat is initially at rest, it will recoil with
velocity components Vy and Vx respectively perpen-
dicular and parallel to the surface, where the veloc-
ity components refer to the impact point on the bat.
The recoil velocity at the handle end or the center of
mass of the bat are diﬀerent since the bat will tend
to rotate about an axis near the end of the handle.
The bounce can be characterized in terms of three
independent parameters: the normal coeﬃcient of
restitution (COR) ey = (vy2 − Vy)/vy1; the tangen-
tial COR, ex, deﬁned by

ex = −

(vx2 − rω2 − [Vx − RΩ])
(vx1 − rω1)

(1)

where Ω is the angular velocity of the bat about
the longitudinal axis immediately after the collision;
and the parameter D. The two coeﬃcients of resti-
tution are deﬁned respectively in terms of the nor-
mal and tangential speeds of the impact point on the

3

(6)

ball, relative to the bat, immediately after and im-
mediately before the bounce. The bounce can also
be characterized in terms of apparent coeﬃcients of
restitution, ignoring recoil and rotation of the bat.
That is, one can deﬁne the apparent normal COR
eA = vy2/vy1 and the apparent tangential COR, eT ,
given by

eT = −

(vx2 − rω2)
(vx1 − rω1)

There are three advantages of deﬁning apparent
COR values in this manner. The ﬁrst is that ap-
parent COR values are easier to measure since there
is no need to measure the bat speed and angular ve-
locity before or after the collision (provided the bat
speed is zero before the collision). The second ad-
vantage is that the batted ball speed can be calcu-
lated from the measured apparent COR values for
any given initial bat speed simply by a change of
reference frame. We show how this is done in Ap-
pendix B. The third advantage is that the algebraic
solutions of the collision equations are considerably
simpliﬁed and therefore more easily interpreted. Ap-
parent and actual values of the COR are related by
the expressions

In these expressions, m is the ball mass, I0 and Iz are

the center of mass and perpendicular and parallel,
respectively, to the longitudinal axis of the bat, and

4

b is the distance parallel to the longitudinal axis be-
tween the impact point and the center of mass. For
the bat used in the experiments at an impact dis-
tance 15 cm from the barrel end of the bat, ry=0.188
and rx=0.159, assuming the bat is free at both ends.
The exit parameters of the ball are independent of
whether the handle end is free or hand–held, as de-
scribed previously by the authors.9,10 Eq. 4 will not
be used in this paper except for some comments in

Sec. IV C and for comparison with SHS1 who as-
sumed in their calculations that ex = 0 and D = 0,
implying eT = −0.14 for our bat. As discussed more
fully in the next section, we ﬁnd better agreement
with our data when eT = 0.

From the deﬁnition of the parameter D, the nor-
mal force exerts a torque resulting in a change in
angular momentum of the ball about the contact
point given by

Eqs. 8 and 9, together with the deﬁnition of eA
give a complete description of the scattering pro-
cess in the sense that, for given initial conditions,
there are three observables, vy2, vx2, and ω2, and
three unknown parameters, eA, eT , and D, that can
be inferred from a measurement of the observables.
We have written Eq. 8 and 9 for the general case
of nonzero D. However, as we will show in the
next section, the present data are consistent with
D = 0, implying conservation of the ball’s angular
momentum about the point of contact. The normal
bounce speed of the ball is determined by eA, while
for D ≈ 0 the spin and tangential bounce speed are
determined by eT and rω1/vx1. Depending on the
magnitude and sign of the latter parameter, vx2 and
ω2 can each be positive, zero or negative. Eqs. 8 and

9 are generalizations of equations written down by
Cross4 for the special case of the ball impacting a
massive surface and reduce to those equations when
eA = ey and eT = ex.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND
DISCUSSION

A. Determination of eT

We initially analyze the data using Eqs. 8 and
9 assuming D = 0 and postpone for the time be-
ing a discussion of angular momentum conservation.
Results obtained when the ball was incident on the
bat without initial spin are shown in Fig. 2. The

ball impacted the bat at speeds varying from 3.8 to
4.2 m/s but the results in Fig. 2 were scaled to an
incident speed of 4.0 m/s by assuming that the re-
bound speed and spin are both directly proportional
to the incident ball speed, as expected theoretically.
An experimental value eA = 0.375±0.005 was deter-
mined from results at low (back) scattering angles,
and this value was used together with Eqs. 8 and 9
to calculate rebound speed, spin, and scattering an-
gle as functions of the impact parameter for various
assumed values of eT . Best ﬁts to the experimental
data were found when eT = 0 but reasonable ﬁts
could also be obtained with eT = 0 ± 0.1. Results
obtained when the ball was incident with topspin or
backspin are shown in Fig. 3. These results are not
expected to scale with either the incident speed or
incident spin and have not been normalized. Con-
sequently the data show slightly more scatter than
those presented in Figs. 2. The ball impacted the
bat at speeds varying from 3.9 to 4.1 m/s and with
topspin varying from 75 to 83 rad/s or with back-
spin varying from -72 to -78 rad/s. Simultaneous
ﬁts to all three data sets resulted in eA = 0.37 ± 0.02
and with eT = 0 ± 0.02. Using the recoil factors
ry = 0.188 and rx = 0.159, our values for eA and
eT imply ey = 0.63 ± 0.01 and ex = 0.16 ± 0.02.
The result for ex is consistent with that measured
by impacting the ball onto a hard ﬂoor (0.17 ± 0.03)
but the result for ey is slightly higher, presumably
because of the lower impact speed and the softer im-
pact on the bat. On the other hand, Figs. 2 and 3
show that the measured ω2 values are inconsistent
with eT = −0.14, which is the result expected for
our bat if ex = 0, as assumed by SHS.1

We next investigate the more general case in which
angular momentum is not conserved by ﬁtting the
data to Eqs. 8 and 9 allowing both D and eT as
adjustable parameters. Fitting to all three data sets
simultaneously, we ﬁnd eT = 0±0.02 and D = 0.21±
0.29 mm. This justiﬁes our earlier neglect of D and
conﬁrms that the data are consistent with angular
momentum conservation. All calculations discussed
below will assume D = 0.

It is possible to determine the incident and out-
going angles with respect to the normal, θ1 and θ2,
from the measured quantities v1, v2, ω1, ω2, and α by
applying angular momentum conservation about the
contact point, Eq. 7, with D=0. Once θ1 and θ2 are
known, it becomes possible to calculate other quanti-
ties of interest, such as the initial and ﬁnal tangential

quantities is shown in Fig. 4, where it is seen that the
ﬁnal velocities are clustered around zero, as would
be expected for eT = 0 (see Eq. 2). When plotted in
this manner, it is quite clear that the data are com-
pletely inconsistent with eT = −0.14. Note that the
principal sensitivity to eT comes from large values of
|vx1 − rω1|. This occurs whenever vx1 and ω1 have
the opposite sign, leading to a reversal of the spin
and scattering angles that are negative for ω1 > 0

Implications for batted balls

We next explore the implications of our results
for the spin and speed of a batted ball, fully mindful
that the present experiment was done at very low

gential velocity of the ball. For eT = 0, the ﬁnal tan-
gential velocity would be zero. The dashed line is the
expected result for eT = −0.14.

speeds compared to those appropriate for the game
of baseball. The goal of this analysis is not to make
any deﬁnite predictions about the spin and speed
of a batted ball but to examine the consequences
of a small positive value of ex relative to the value
ex = 0 assumed by SHS.1 Whether such a value of
ex is realized in a realistic ball-bat collision will have
to await experiments at higher speed.

With that caveat, we ﬁrst consider directly our
own data in Fig. 5, where we plot ω2 versus the im-
pact parameter E, which is calculated from the in-
ferred value of θ1. These data demonstrate that for
a given E > 0, a ball with initial topspin (ω1 > 0)
has a larger outgoing backspin than a ball with ini-
tial backspin, in qualitative agreement with the ar-
gument of SHS.1 To investigate the argument more
quantitatively, we apply our formalism to the ball-
bat scattering problem of SHS1 to compare the ﬁ-
nal spin on a fastball to that on a curveball.
In
this problem, the bat and ball approach each other
prior to the collision, thereby necessitating applying
a change of reference frame to the formulas already
developed. The relevant formulas, Eqs. B2–B4, are
derived in Appendix B. We assume that the initial
velocity of the bat is parallel to that of the ball, but
displaced by the impact parameter E, as shown in

a

Fig. 6. The initial bat speed is 32 m/s (71.6 mph).
The incident fastball has a speed of 42 m/s (94 mph)
and spin of -200 rad/s (-1910 rpm), whereas the inci-
dent curveball has a speed of 35 m/s (78 mph) and a
spin of +200 rad/s. Using values of the normal COR
ey assumed by SHS1,12 the calculated ﬁnal spin as a
function of E is presented in Fig. 6 both for eT = 0,
as determined from the present measurements, and
for eT = −0.14, as assumed by SHS.1

Several important features emerge from this plot.
First, the ﬁnal spin ω2 is less sensitive to the initial
spin ω1 for eT = 0 than for eT = −0.14. This result
is consistent with Eq. 9, where the ﬁrst term on the
righthand side is larger for eT < 0 than for eT = 0.
Our result means that the diﬀerence in backspin be-
tween a hit fastball and hit curveball is not as large
as suggested by SHS.1 Second, the gap between the
spin on the curveball and fastball decreases as E in-
creases, a feature that can be understood from the
second term on the righthand side of Eq. 9. Since
the initial speed is larger for the fastball than the
curveball, the second term grows more rapidly for
the fastball as E increases, and eventually the two
curves cross at E ≈ 2.4 in. Moreover, the rate at
which the two curves converge is greater for eT = 0
than for eT = −0.14. Had the initial speeds been
identical, the two curves would have been parallel.
Third, for E >
∼ 0.5 in. and independent of the sign
of ω1, ω2 is larger when eT = 0 than when eT < 0,
since ω2 is mainly governed by the second term on
the righthand side of Eq. 9. The increase in ω2 is
accompanied by a decrease in vx2, as required by
angular momentum conservation, and therefore by a
slightly smaller scattering angle. However, the out-
going speed is dominated by the normal component,
so the decrease in vx2 hardly aﬀects the speed of the
ball leaving the bat, at least for balls hit on a home
run trajectory.

These results will have implications for the issue of
whether an optimally hit curveball will travel farther
than an optimally hit fastball. To investigate this in
detail requires a calculation of the trajectory of a hit
baseball, much as was done by SHS.1 Such a calcu-
lation requires knowledge of the lift and drag forces
on a spinning baseball. However, given the current
controversy about these forces,2 further speculation
on this issue is beyond the scope of the present work.
It is interesting to speculate on the relative eﬀec-
tiveness of diﬀerent bats regarding their ability to
put backspin on a baseball. As we have emphasized,

7

the eﬀectiveness is determined by a single parame-
ter, eT , which in turn is related to the horizontal
COR ex and the recoil factor rx. For a given ex, a
bat with a smaller rx will be more eﬀective than one
with a larger rx (see Eq. 4). Since rx is dominated
by the term involving R2/Iz (see Eq. 6), one might
expect it to be very diﬀerent for wood and aluminum
bats. Because of the hollow thin-walled construction
of an aluminum bat, it will have a larger MOI about
the longitudinal axis (Iz) than a wood bat of com-
parable mass and shape. This advantage is partially
oﬀset by the disadvantage of having a center of mass
farther from the impact point (b is larger), which in-
creases rx. As a simple numerical exercise, we have
investigated two bats having the shape of an R161,
one a solid wood bat and the other a thin-walled
aluminum bat. Both bats are 34 in. long and weigh
31.5 oz. The wood bat has I0=2578 and Iz=18.0 oz-
in2 and the center of mass 22.7 in. from the knob.
The aluminum bat has I0=2985 and Iz=29.3 oz-in2
and the center of mass 20.2 in. from the knob. With
an impact 6 in. from the barrel end, where the bat
diameter is 2.625 in, and assuming ex=0.16, then
eT is -0.03 and 0, respectively, for the wood and
aluminum bat. We conclude that, generally speak-
ing, an aluminum bat is marginally more eﬀective in
putting backspin on the baseball than a wood bat of
comparable mass and shape.

Insights into the scattering process

Besides the obvious practical implications of our
result, it is interesting to ask what it teaches us
about the scattering process itself. As mentioned
earlier, our measured value eT = 0 necessarily im-
plies that ex ≈ 0.16. A value ex < 0 would be
obtained if the ball slides on the surface throughout
the collision, whereas a value ex = 0 would be ob-
tained if the ball is rolling when it leaves the bat.
However, a positive value of ex necessarily implies
tangential compliance in the ball, the bat, or both.
A rigid baseball impacting on a rigid bat without
any tangential compliance in the contact region will
slide on the bat until the contact point comes to
rest, in which case it will enter a rolling mode and
it will continue to roll with zero tangential velocity
as it bounces oﬀ the bat.13 However, a real baseball
and a real bat can store energy elastically as a re-
sult of deformation in directions both perpendicular

and parallel to the impact surface. In that case, if
tangential velocity is lost temporarily during the col-
lision, then it can be regained from the elastic energy
stored in the ball and the bat as a result of tangential
deformation in the contact region. The ball will then
bounce in an “overspinning” mode with rω2 > vx2
or with ex > 0. The details of this process were ﬁrst
established by Maw, et al.14,15 The eﬀect is most
easily observed in the bounce of a superball16 which
has tangential COR typically greater than 0.5.3,4 A
simple lumped-parameter model for the bounce of a
ball with tangential compliance has been developed
by Stronge.17

As mentioned above, the signature for continuous
sliding throughout the collision is ex < 0. Referring
to Fig. 4, data with ex < 0 would lie above or below
the dashed line for values of vx1 − rω1 greater than
or less than zero, respectively. Not a single collision
satisﬁes that condition in the present data set, sug-
gesting that µk is large enough to bring the sliding
to a halt. Therefore the scattering data themselves
can be used to set a lower limit on µk, which must be
at least as large as the ratio of tangential to normal

In Fig. 7 values of the RHS of Eq. 10 are plotted as
a function of the initial ratio of tangential to nor-
mal speed. Using the results derived in Appendix
A, it is straightforward to show that these quan-
tities are linearly proportional with a slope equal
to (2/7)(1 + eT )/(1 + eA), provided the initial ve-
locity ratio is below the critical value needed to
halt the sliding. Stronge shows17 and we conﬁrm
with our own formalism that the critical value is
(7/2)µk(1 + eA)(1 + rx), which in our experiment
assumes the numerical value 5.6µk. Above the crit-
ical value, the impulse ratio should be constant and
equal to µk. Given that the data still follow a linear
relationship up to an initial velocity ratio of 2.4, cor-
responding to an impulse ratio of 0.50, we conclude

small as 0.50, the critical value of the initial veloc-
ity ratio would be 2.8, which exceeds the maximum
value in the experiment. The lower limit of 0.50 is
larger than the lower limit of 0.31 that we measured
from oblique collisions of a nonspinning ball with the

izontal needed to achieve continuous slipping is less
than 20◦, which is smaller than our minimum angle
of 25◦. Although no attempt was made to measure
the ball-bat µk directly, our lower limit is consistent
with µk = 0.50 ± 0.04 measured by SHS.1

Finally, we remark on our ﬁnding that the scat-
tering data are consistent with D ≈ 0, implying
that the angular momentum of the ball is conserved
about the initial contact point. At low enough initial
speed, the deformation of the ball will be negligible,
so that the ball and bat interact at a point and the
angular momentum of the ball is necessarily con-
served about that point. Evidentally, this condition
is satisﬁed at 4 m/s initial speed. It is interesting to
speculate whether this condition will continue to be
satisﬁed at the much higher speeds relevant to the
game of baseball, where the ball experiences con-
siderable deformation and a signiﬁcant contact area
during the collision. Simple physics consideratons4
suggest that it will not. A ball with topspin inci-
dent at an oblique angle will have a larger normal
velocity at the leading edge than the trailing edge,
resulting in a shift of the line of action of the nor-
mal force ahead of the center of mass of the ball
(D > 0). A similar shift occurs when brakes are ap-
plied to a moving automobile, resulting in a larger
normal force on the front wheels than on the back.
Such a shift has been observed in high-speed colli-
sions of tennis balls.4,19 Whether a comparable shift
occurs in high-speed baseball collisions will have to
be answered with appropriate experimental data.

V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We have performed a series of experiments in
which a baseball is scattered from a bat at an initial
speed of about 4 m/s. For the particular bat that
was used in the experiment, we ﬁnd the horizontal
apparent coeﬃcient of restitution eT is consistent
with 0 and inconsistent with the value −0.14 ex-
pected if the ball is rolling at the end of its impact.
These results necessarily imply tangential compli-
ance in the ball, the bat, or both. We further ﬁnd
that the data are consistent with conservation of an-
gular momentum of the ball about the contact point
and with a coeﬃcient of sliding friction between the
ball and bat larger than 0.50. Our results suggest
that a curveball can be hit with greater backspin

than a fastball, but by an amount that is less than
would be the case in the absence of tangential com-
pliance. We note that since our investigations were
done at low speed, one must proceed with caution
before applying them to the higher speeds that are
typical of the game of baseball.

APPENDIX A: RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
eT AND ex

In this section, we derive for tangential collisions
the relationship, Eqs. 4 and 6, between the apparent
COR eT and the COR ex. The derivation follows
closely that presented by Cross8 for the relationship
between eA and ey. We ﬁrst solve the simple prob-
lem involving the collision of two point objects in one
dimension. Object A of mass m and velocity v1 is
incident on stationary object B of mass M . Object
A rebounds backwards with velocity v2 and object B
recoils with velocity V . Our sign convention is that
v1 is always positive and v2 is positive if it is in the
opposite direction to v1. The collision is completely
speciﬁed by the conservation of momentum

F dt = m(v2 + v1) = M V ,

From the deﬁnitions in Eq. 1 and 2,

where F is the magnitude of the force the two ob-
jects exert on each other. We deﬁne the apparent
coeﬃcient of restitution

and we seek a relationship between eA and e. Using
Eq. A2, we write e as

from which we easily derive our desired expression

We next generalize this procedure for the colli-
sion of extended objects, as shown in Figs. 1 and 8.
Speciﬁcally we consider the collision between a ball
and a bat. A ball of mass m and radius r is incident
obliquely in the xy-plane on a stationary bat of mass
M and radius R at the impact point. Our coordi-
nate system has its origin at the center of mass of
the bat, with the z axis along the longitudinal axis
and the x and y axes in the tangential and normal
directions, respectively. The impact point P has the
coordinates (0, R, b). The ball is incident with an-
gular velocity ω1 and linear velocity components vx1
and vy1; it rebounds with angular velocity ω2 and
linear velocity vx2 and vy2, where the angular veloc-
ities are about the z axis. The bat recoils with CM
velocity components Vx and Vy and with angular ve-
locity about the CM with components Ωx, Ωy, and
Ωz. Let ~vp1, ~vp2, and ~Vp denote the pre- and post-
impact velocities of the ball and the post-impact ve-
locity of the bat at the point P, respectively. Since
we are concerned with tangential collisions, we only
consider the x components of these velocities, which
are given by

Applying the impulse-momentum expressions to the
bat, we ﬁnd

those used by SHS.1 We note that Stronge17 has de-
rived an expression that is equivalent to Eq. 6 for
the special case of a bat with zero length, implying
b = 0, and D = 0. The present result is a general-
ization of Stronge’s expression.

APPENDIX B: COLLISION FORMULAS IN
THE LABORATORY REFERENCE FRAME

The formulas we have derived, Eqs. 8–9, for vx2
and ω2 are valid in the reference frame in which the
bat is initially at rest at the impact point. The usual
(or “laboratory”) frame that is relevant for baseball
is the one where both the bat and ball initially ap-
proach each other. In this section, we derive formu-
las for vx2 and ω2 in the laboratory frame. Our co-
ordinate system is the same as that shown in Fig. 8,
where the y axis is normal and the x axis is par-

allel to the ball-bat contact surface.
tem, the initial velocity components of the bat and
ball at the impact point are denoted by (Vx, Vy) and
(vx1 − rω1, vy1), respectively, where the usual situa-
tion has Vy > 0 and vy1 < 0. In the bat rest frame,
the components of the ball initial velocity at the im-
pact point are therefore (vx1 − rω1 − Vx, vy1 − Vy).

and

and

and

Applying the deﬁnitions of eT and eA, the compo-
nents of the ball velocity after the collision are given
by

vx2 − rω2 − Vx = −eT (vx1 − rω1 − Vx)

vy2 − Vy = eA (vy1 − Vy) ,

which can be rearranged to arrive at

vx2 − rω2 = −eT (vx1 − rω1) + (1 + eT )Vx (B1)

vy2 = eAvy1 + (1 + eA)Vy .

(B2)

Finally, we combine Eq. B1 with the expression for
angular momentum conservation, Eq. 7, to ﬁnd the
following expressions for vx2 and w2:

vx2 = vx1

+ (rω1 + Vx)

(1 − αeT )
(1 + α)

α(1 + eT )
(1 + α)

(B3)

rω2 = rω1

+ (vx1 − Vx)

(α − eT )
(1 + α)

(1 + eT )
(1 + α)

.

(B4)

Eqs.B2–B4 are the results we seek. Eq. B2 has
appeared in the literature many times.18,19 To our
knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time anyone has written
an explicit formula for vx2 and ω2 in the laboratory
frame. Although explicit formulas were not writ-
ten down, the earlier works of SHS1 and Watts and
Baroni20 are equivalent to ours for the special case
ex = 0, the latter being equivalent to eT = −0.137
for our bat. Our formulas represent a generalization
of their work to the case of arbitrary ex.

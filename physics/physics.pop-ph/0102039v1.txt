Abstract

Based on a mathematical simulation which reproduces accurate split and velocity proﬁles for the 100
and 200 metre sprints, the magnitudes of altitude and mixed wind/altitude-assisted performances
as compared to their sea-level equivalents are presented. It is shown that altitude-assisted marks for
the 200 metre are signiﬁcantly higher than for the 100 metre, suggesting that the “legality” of such
marks perhaps be reconsidered.

1 Introduction

According to IAAF regulations, sprint and jump performances for which the measured
wind-speed exceeds +2.0 m/s are deemed illegal, and cannot be ratiﬁed for record
purposes (IAAF 1998). Similarly, performances which are achieved at altitudes ex-
ceeding 1000 metres above sea level are noted as “altitude-assisted”, but unlike their
wind-aided counterparts, these can and have qualiﬁed for record status. Indeed, the
1968 Olympics saw amazing World Records (WRs) set in the men’s 100 m, 200 m,
and Long Jump, thanks in part to the lofty 2250 metre elevation of Mexico City.
Other examples of such overt assistance include Pietro Mennea’s former 200 m WR
of 19.72 seconds, Marion Jones’ 1998 clocking of 10.65 s in Johannesburg, Obadele
Thompson’s wind- assisted 9.69 s, and Michael Johnson’s early 2000-season marks of
19.71 s in the 200 m and World Best 30.85 s.

A search of the academic literature reveals a wealth of sources which discuss
the impact of wind and altitude assistance in the 100 metre sprint. Based both on
statistical and theoretical models, the general consensus of most researchers is that
the maximum legal tail-wind of +2.0 m/s yields roughly a 0.10-0.12 second advantage
over still conditions at low altitude. With no wind, every 1000 m of elevation will
improve a performance by roughly 0.03-0.04 seconds, implying that still conditions
in Mexico City have about a 0.07 s advantage over their sea-level equivalents. The
interested reader is directed to references (Davies 1980, Dapena 1987, Dapena 2000,
Linthorne 1994a, Linthorne 1994b, Mureika 2001a) and citations therein for further
information.

Conversely, little attention has been paid to the equivalent corrections in the 200
metres. There are multifold reasons why this is perhaps the case, the largest of which
being a lack of essential wind data for the ﬁrst half of the race. The wind gauge is

1

operated only after the ﬁrst competitor has entered the straight, and without a second,
perpendicular wind gauge placed at the top of the curve, the actual conditions in the
ﬁrst 100 metres remain a mystery. In a recent article (Mureika 2001b), such eﬀects
have been studied, accounting for variable wind eﬀects on the curve.

The model used in this investigation is a direct extension of that presented in
(Mureika 2001a), whose results are consistent with independent investigations. The
underlying framework of the model is a part-mathematical, part-physical force equa-
tion of the form

Fnet(t; v, w) = Fpropulsive(t) − Finternal(v; t) − Fdrag(v, w) ,

(1)

Here, Fpropulsive(t) and Finternal(v; t) are functions of the “sprinter”, and are depen-
dent on the elapsed time t and athlete’s resulting velocity v(t). They are intended to
numerically represent both the forward driving of the sprinter, as well as any internal
variables which govern the overall acceleration and speed (e.g. ﬂexibility, stride rate,
fast-twitch rate, and so forth). The drag term Fdrag(v, w; ρ) = 1/2 ρ(H)Ad(v(t) − w)2
is an external, physical quantity, which is a function of the square of the sprinter’s rel-
ative velocity to the air, the athlete’s average drag area Ad (or frontal cross- sectional
area times the drag coeﬃcient, normalized to mass), and the atmospheric density
ρ = ρ(H) (dependent on the altitude H of the venue). Fnet is twice-integrated with
respect to time to obtain the distance traveled as a function of time, d(t), and hence
for a suitable choice of input parameters, has been shown to eﬀectively and realisti-
cally simulate the split/speed proﬁles of a 100 metre race.

Since the eﬀects of cross-winds (i.e. winds that are completely perpendicular
to the direction of motion) are assumed to be negligible, only the forward drag is
included. Hence, for the 200 metre simulations, only the component of the wind in
the direction of motion are considered (which depends on the position of the athlete

undoubtedly aﬀect the motion in some fashion, but since these eﬀects are currently
unknown, they are left for future work.

This article is not designed to be an expository of the numerical model, but
rather a highlight of the results which address the “legality” of wind and altitude
assistance for the 200 m sprint, as compared to those in the 100 m. The interested
reader is referred to (Mureika 2001a, Mureika 2001b) for a complete mathematical
and methodological formulation.

2 Wind and Altitude Eﬀects in the 100 m

Table 1 shows correction estimates for a 10.00 second 100 metre performance run
with 0-wind at sea level, obtained from the model discussed in (Mureika 2000a).
Corrections are to be interpreted as ∆t = toﬃcial − t0,0, i.e. the amount by which
the 0-wind, sea level performance t0,0 is adjusted under the conditions. So, negative

2

corrections mean faster oﬃcial times (and vice versa for positive ∆t). Note that a
legal-limit wind at high altitude will provide almost a 60% increase over the same
conditions at sea-level. Only for extremely high elevations does the magnitude of
the altitude assistance alone approach that of the wind, with the minimum altitude-
assisted correction being about 0.04 seconds. Only at altitudes at exceeding 2000 m
does the assistance begin to approach that provided by a low-altitude legal-limit wind.
For a +1 m/s wind at 2000 m, the theoretical assistance is equal to a legal-limit, sea
level wind. These ﬁgures are in good agreement with those in (Dapena 2000), with
showing only mild variations at higher altitudes and wind speeds.

An easy to use “back-of-the-envelope” formula was presented in (Mureika 2001a),
which can be used to quickly calculate the corresponding corrections of Table 1. This
is

t0,0 ≃ tw,H h1.03 − 0.03exp(−0.000125 · H)(1 − w · tw,H/100)2

with t0,0, tw,H, w, and H deﬁned as before. Thus, 100 metre sprint times may be
corrected to their 0-wind, sea level equivalents by inputting only the oﬃcial time, the
wind gauge reading, and the altitude of the sporting venue. Since Equation 2 is easily
programmable in most scientiﬁc calculators and portable computers, it may be used
track-side by coaches, oﬃcials and the media immediately following a race to gauge
its overall “quality”.

3 Wind and Altitude Eﬀects in the 200 m

The story, however, is diﬀerent for the longer sprint. Tables 2, 3 and exemplify
the degree of assistance which wind and altitude provide for World Class men and
women’s performances (20.00 s and 22.00 s). The estimates assume a race run around
a curve of radius equivalent to about lane 4 of a standard IAAF track, implying the
distance run around the curve is 115.6 m, and 84.4 m on the straight. The model
Equations 1 are modiﬁed by the addition of an appropriate “damping factor” to the

3

propulsive forces (a function of the velocity and the lane’s radius). When coupled
with the eﬀects of wind, the amplitude of the altitude corrections escalates. While the
absolute value of the corrections may not be known at this point, it is the magnitude
of these estimates to which this research note draws attention.

The data presented in Tables 2, 3 assume that the wind is entirely in the direction
measured by the gauge. In this case, the athlete initially faces a head-wind out of the
blocks, which gradually subsides and increases to its maximum value as the sprinter
rounds the bend. A straight wind of +2.0 m/s adjusts the overall 200 m time by
−0.12 s for men (−0.14 s for women), slightly more than the correction for the 100 m
under similar conditions. However, the diﬀerence between the two race corrections
quickly grows for increasing wind-speed and altitude. In fact, the pure altitude eﬀects
at the minimum 1000 m elevation are found to be equivalent to that provided by a
legal-limit wind in the 100 m. Furthermore, the combined wind and altitude eﬀects
could become as high as 0.25-0.30 seconds for extreme elevations (H > 2000 m).

to 20.00 s (22.00 s) performance at sea level, 0-wind. The wind direction is assumed to be completely
in the direction of the gauge (100 metre straight).

Note that the 100 m splits do not signiﬁcantly change for the wind conditions
considered. Up to about 1000 m altitude, the head-wind equivalent conditions in the
early part of the race actually serve to slow the splits from their 0-wind, sea level
equivalent. Even at high elevations, the splits are not signiﬁcantly aﬀected, being
corrected by only -0.05 s at the most. The split corrections for the 0-wind condition
are essentially identical to those for the 100 m, since the adjustments depend on the
velocity proﬁle over the distance, and are not aﬀected by the curve.

Using the corrections of Table 2, one can obtain “ﬁrst-order” adjustments of some
key 200 m performances. For example, Pietro Mennea’s WR of 19.72 seconds run in
Mexico City with a +1.8 m/s wind would be corrected by approximately 0.31 seconds,
yielding a 0-wind, sea-level equivalent of 20.03 s. This is essentially equivalent to his
low-altitude bests, e.g. (20.01 s; +0.0 m/s) in Rome (08 Aug 1980). Similarly, Michael
Johnson’s 19.71 s (+1.8 m/s) in Pietersburg (approximately 1200 m) would roughly
adjust to a mid-19.9 s. This is also quite consistent with his low-altitude bests of 2000,
all of which clustered around 19.90 s. Tables4, 5 show the corrected top-5 all-time
performances for men and women, as well as the re-ranked top-5 performances.

It should be stressed that the calculations herein were performed for an perfor-
mance around a curve of equivalent radius to lane 4 (and appropriate stagger). The
correction estimates for a straight wind will actually vary by several hundredths of a
second from lane 1 to 8. For a tail-wind, there will be minimal assistance provided
in lane 1, and maximal in lane 8. Thus, lane 4 is selected as the “standard” for
conversion.

As previously mentioned, the lack of wind condition information over the ﬁrst
half of the 200 m race ultimately prevents completely accurate correction estimates.
For a wind w blowing at angle θ to the straight, the gauge reads w cos θ. An angle
θ = 0 corresponds to a wind purely down the straight, with the value increasing in
the counterclockwise direction (such that θ < 0 will provide a tail-wind assistance
around the bend, and θ > 0 a head-wind). Preliminary results (see Mureika 2000b)
indicate that there is an extremely wide range of variations in corrections for 200
metre performances apparently run under the “same” wind conditions (as read by
the gauge). In fact, for a raw 20.00 s race, the correction diﬀerential between eﬀective

tail-winds and head-winds on the curve could be up to 0.3 s for lower altitudes. At
high altitudes, this diﬀerential could exceed 0.6 s!

In 1990, Leroy Burrell ran the fastest-ever wind-assisted 200 m, a startling time
of 19.61 s (+4.0 m/s) (see Table 5). Application of the straight-wind corrections
would give a 0-wind, sea-level time of 19.83 s, much faster than his legal sea-level
best of 20.12 s (−0.8 m/s, New Orleans; 20.06 s corrected). However, a wind in
excess of 5 m/s blowing at an angle of roughly -40 degrees would produce the proper
gauge reading, and assist the performance by up to 0.4 s, much more consistent with
Burrell’s previous marks. Also, if this race had been run in a higher lane than 4,
the correction would be larger (but still faster than his previous bests, if the wind is
assumed purely in the 100 m direction).

If these correction estimates are accurate, then the suggestion is put forth to
the IAAF that the status of higher (but legal) wind and altitude-assisted 200 metre
marks be reconsidered. The degree of variation from diﬀering wind angles would also
aﬀect the IAAF Top Performance lists introduced this year, as well as similar scoring
tables which account for accompanying wind speeds. Equivalently, these types of
corrections could be used to “rate” the quality sprints run under varying conditions.
A wind gauge placed at the top of the curve could help to shed light on these eﬀects,
as well as assist in the evaluation and comparison of race performances.

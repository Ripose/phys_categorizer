1. Introduction

The idea behind spacetime noncommutativity is to replace the coordinates xi of
spacetime by Hermitian operators (also denoted xi) which obey the commutation
relations

= i θij ,

xi , xj
(cid:2)

(1)

(cid:3)
where θij is an antisymmetric tensor that may be constant, a function of the coor-
dinates xi themselves, or a function of both coordinates and momenta. In the ﬁrst
instance the operators xi essentially deﬁne a Heisenberg algebra, while in the last
case they generate an algebra of pseudo-diﬀerential operators. This idea dates back
to the 1930’s and is attributed to Heisenberg, who proposed it as a means to control
the ultraviolet divergences which plagued quantum ﬁeld theory. It was purported
to ameliorate the problem of inﬁnite self-energies in a Lorentz-invariant way (for
appropriate choices of θij ). The ﬁrst phenomenological realization of this idea took
place not in particle physics but rather in condensed matter physics by Peierls, who
applied it to non-relativistic electronic systems in external magnetic ﬁelds (the cel-
ebrated Peierls substitution).1 The idea propagated from Peierls onto Pauli, then
onto Oppenheimer, who gave the problem to his graduate student Snyder, leading
to the ﬁrst published paper with systematic analysis on the subject in 1947.2

A toy model of this realization comes about from taking θij in (1) to be real-
valued constants. In this case the θij play a role completely analogous to Planck’s
constant ~ in the quantum phase space relation [xi, pj] = i ~ δi
j. In particular, there
is a spacetime uncertainty relation

which implies that
measures the smallest patch of observable area in the (ij)-
plane. This gives a limit to the resolution in which one may probe spacetime itself,
and hence gives insight into short-distance spacetime structure. The spacetime be-
comes “fuzzy” at very short distances, as there is no longer any deﬁnite notion of
a ‘point’. Such ideas are very common in models of quantum gravity, which pre-
dicts that classical general relativity breaks down at the Planck scale and requires
a modiﬁcation of the classical notions of geometry. The recent surge of excitement
in the subject has come about from the discovery that such scenarios are realized
explicitly in string theory with D-branes.3,4,5,6,7

The purpose of this article is to provide a rudimentary exposition of the interre-
lationships between the ideas of noncommutative geometry that we have described
above. The material is geared at the reader with a reasonable background in the-
oretical physics, but no detailed prior knowledge of noncommutative geometry or

string theory. We will begin by presenting a very simple quantum mechanical model,
the Landau problem,8 which represents the simplest framework in which one can
see noncommutative ﬁeld theory emerging as an eﬀective description of the dynam-
ics (Section 2). We will then brieﬂy describe how this scenario emerges in string
theory (Section 3), and how it leads to the study of noncommutative quantum ﬁeld
theory (Section 4). We also describe various potential applications of this formalism
to processes in particle physics and in astrophysics. Finally, in Section 5 we turn
our attention back to the framework of Section 2 and describe a novel application of
noncommutative ﬁeld theory in condensed matter physics to the fractional quantum
Hall eﬀect.9,10,11 More extensive reviews of noncommutative ﬁeld theory may be
found in Refs. 12, 13, 14, where more complete lists of references are also given.

2. Strong Magnetic Fields

In this Section we will describe how the fundamental notions of noncommutative
ﬁeld theory arise in what is perhaps the simplest possible physical setting, namely
the quantum mechanics of the motion of charged particles in two dimensions under
the inﬂuence of a constant, perpendicularly applied magnetic ﬁeld.8 This introduces
the main technical points that the string theory inspirations do, as we will describe
in the next Section, but within a much simpler framework. It also makes contact
with the historical development of the subject described in the previous Section
and will be one of the motivations for the application of noncommutative ﬁeld
theory that we describe in Section 5. A similar introduction to noncommutativity
is presented in Ref. 15.

2.1. The Landau problem

The Landau problem deals with a system of Ne non-relativistic, interacting elec-
trons moving in two-dimensions. We denote their position coordinates and velocities
respectively by

rI =

xI , yI

with I = 1, . . . , Ne. The two-dimensional system is subjected to a constant, external
perpendicularly applied magnetic ﬁeld B = B ˆz (Fig. 1). We will work in the gauge
where the corresponding vector potential is of the form

A(rI ) = (0, B xI )

with B = ∇ × A. The Lagrangian governing this motion is then given by

where V is the electron self-energy due its interaction, say, with an impurity which is
externally introduced into the system, and U is a pair-interaction potential between
the electrons with the hard-core condition U (0) = 0.

canonical momentum obeying the usual commutation relations

Thus the physical (i.e. gauge invariant) momenta of the electrons in the background

The quantum momenta πI can be written in terms of harmonic oscillator cre-
ation and annihilation operators. In the absence of interactions, V = U = 0, the
energy eigenvalues of the normal-ordered Hamiltonian (6) are thus those of Landau

In the next Subsection we will examine the Landau problem in the limit whereby
this mass gap becomes very large and all excited Landau levels decouple from the
ground state which has quantum numbers nI = 0 for all I = 1, . . . , Ne.

2.2. The lowest Landau level

In the previous Subsection we encountered a very simple situation in which the
momentum space of a physical system is noncommutative. To see how a noncom-
, i.e.
mutative coordinate space arises, let us consider the strong ﬁeld limit B
the energy regime B

symmetric gauge choice A(rI ) = 1
2 (

B yI , B xI ).
Let us now examine the precise meaning of the limit taken above. Since the
cyclotronic frequency (11) diverges in the limit B
0), the spacing
(12) between Landau levels becomes inﬁnite and the lowest nI = 0 level decouples
from all of the rest. Thus the strong ﬁeld limit projects the quantum mechanical
system onto the lowest Landau level. This limit is in fact a phase space reductive
one. Since the reduced Lagrangian (13) is of ﬁrst order in time derivatives, it eﬀec-
tively turns the coordinate space into a phase space. In other words, the original
four-dimensional phase space (per electron) degenerates into the two-dimensional
conﬁguration space. We conclude that noncommuting coordinates arise in electronic
systems constrained to lie in the lowest Landau level.

with ǫij the antisymmetric tensor. The present context is in fact the one in which
the Peierls substitution was originally carried out in 1933.1 If one introduces an
impurity, described by a potential energy function V , into the electronic system as
in (13), then one can compute the ﬁrst order energy shift in perturbation theory,

due to the impurity, of the lowest Landau level by taking the components of the
position coordinates rI = (xI , yI) in V (rI ) to be noncommuting variables.

Let us remark that one could have also arrived at this conclusion within the
Hamiltonian formalism. In the limit described above, the Hamiltonian (6) reduces
to

H

H0 =

V (rI ) +

U (rI −

rJ ) .

XI<J

Ne

XI=1

This reduced Hamiltonian describes a topological theory, in that it vanishes in the
absence of the potentials, whereby there are no propagating degrees of freedom. On
the other hand, the kinematical momenta (7) in this limit become

πI = me vI −→

0 ,

and the condition πI ≡
0 should be treated as constraints on the theory. Since
according to (9) they do not commute, they are second class constraints in the
usual Dirac classiﬁcation of constrained mechanical systems.16 This requires us to
replace canonical Poisson brackets with Dirac brackets, whose quantization under
the correspondence principle of quantum mechanics gives the coordinate noncom-
mutativity (14).15

2.3. Field theory

We now investigate the consequences of noncommutativity on second quantization
of the system, i.e. in its eﬀective non-relativistic ﬁeld theory description. For this,
we introduce the classical electron density

However, it is diﬃcult to deﬁne (19) as a quantum operator. We bypass this problem
by working instead in momentum space with the Fourier transform

Since rI is a noncommuting operator, we must specify an ordering for (22). We
shall use symmetric or Weyl ordering deﬁned by specifying the Fourier transform

This “classical limit” is the general foundation for the deformation quantization

spondence principle of quantum mechanics.

3. String Theory and D-Branes

In this Section we will describe a very precise realization of spacetime noncommu-
tativity which arises in string theory, and which has sparked the enormous amount
of activity in the subject over the past few years. It is a direct generalization of the
example described in the previous Section. Its main virtue is that it naturally in-
duces what is known as a (relativistic) noncommutative ﬁeld theory, the subject of
the next Section. We will ﬁrst describe heuristically why noncommutative geometry
is expected to play a role in string theory,23,24 and then move our way towards a
quantitative derivation of its appearence. Unless explicitly written, in the remainder
of this paper we will assume natural units in which ~ = c = e = 1.

3.1. Noncommutative geometry in string theory

String theory is often regarded as the best candidate for a quantum theory of
gravitation, or more generally as a uniﬁed theory of all the fundamental interactions.
Within the framework of quantum gravity, a noncommutative spacetime geometry
is expected on quite general grounds in any theory incorporating gravity into a

This distorts the surrounding spacetime at very short distance scales in the manner
explained in Section 1. We conclude from this simple analysis that spacetime non-
commutativity is required when trying to quantize the Einstein theory of general
relativity.

A similar scenario emerges directly from string theory. From the analysis of
ultra-high energy string scattering amplitudes,26 one is led to postulate the string-
modiﬁed Heisenberg uncertainty relation27,28

where ℓs is the intrinsic string length (Fig. 2). This relationship reﬂects the inherent
non-locality of string theory, since it implies that the extent of an object grows with
its momentum. At large distance scales
0), wherein
≫
the strings eﬀectively look like point particles, it reduces to the standard phase
space relation in quantum mechanics with the spread decreasing with momentum.
Generically, by minimizing it with respect to ∆p one ﬁnds that there is an absolute
lower bound ∆x
(∆x)min on the measurability of distances in the spacetime given
by the length of the strings,

ℓs (formally the limit ℓs →

≥

(∆x)min = ℓs .

This simply means that strings cannot probe distances smaller than their intrinsic
size. String theory thereby requires a modiﬁcation of classical general relativity.

More generally, basic conformal symmetry arguments in string theory lead to

the anticipation of space/time uncertainty relations29

It is possible to realize such length scales using as probes not the strings themselves,
but rather certain non-perturbative open string degrees of freedom known as D-
branes.30,31,32 In fact, these objects allow one to probe even shorter, sub-Planckian
distance scales in string theory,33 and they enable microscopic derivations of fairly

generalized uncertainty relations which include those described above as a subset.34
They are therefore the natural degrees of freedom which capture phenomena related
to quantum gravitational ﬂuctuations of the spacetime. The beautiful aspect of
this point of view is that these phenomena can be treated systematically and at a
completely quantitative level in string theory.

3.2. D-branes

Motivated by the discussion of the previous Subsection, let us now systematically
look at D-branes. A D-brane may be deﬁned as a hypersurface in spacetime onto
which open strings attach (with Dirichlet boundary conditions). A schematic pic-
ture may be found in Fig. 3. These degrees of freedom are actually required for
the overall consistency of the string theory, which we require to be unitary. The
quantum theory of the open string excitations induces a spectrum of ﬁelds which
reside on the branes. In the massless sector these include a gauge ﬁeld Ai, adjoint
scalar ﬁelds X m describing the transverse ﬂuctuations of the D-branes in spacetime,
and fermion ﬁelds ψα. Integrating out the massive string modes on N coincident
D-branes leaves a low-energy eﬀective ﬁeld theory which can be obtained as the
dimensional reduction, to the brane worldvolume, of ten-dimensional U (N ) Yang-
Mills gauge theory (more precisely, its supersymmetric extension).35

Let us study some features of this low-energy ﬁeld theory description. The re-
duction of the F 2 term of the Yang-Mills action in ten spacetime dimensions (the
critical superstring target space dimension) leads to the Yang-Mills potential

where g is the Yang-Mills coupling constant and X m are N
N Hermitian ma-
trices. If N = 1 then the X m correspond to the ﬁelds which embed the D-brane
into the Euclidean target spacetime. For N > 1 they lose this geometric interpreta-
tion, and in this way the appearence of noncommuting spacetime coordinates arises
via a dynamical mechanism.35 The potential (38) is a sum of non-negative terms,
Tr [X m, X n][X m, X n]†). Its global

minimum VYM(X) = 0 is attained when the Hermitian matrices obey

X m , X n
(cid:2)

(cid:3)

= 0

for each m, n. This means that the Hermitian matrices X m are simultaneously
diagonalizable in the vacuum state. Their simultaneous real eigenvalues describe
collective coordinates for the N D-branes. Thus the classical ground state corre-
sponds to an ordinary classical geometry. However, quantum ﬂuctuations about
the vacuum (39) describe a spacetime with a noncommutative geometry. The ﬂuc-
tuations correspond to turning on oﬀ-diagonal matrix elements of the X m’s and
are associated with short open string excitations between pairs of D-branes,35 as
depicted in Fig. 3.

In this way the worldvolume ﬁeld theories on the D-branes get altered by quan-
tum gravitational eﬀects.33 To understand this modiﬁcation, it is instructive to
examine other classical vacua associated with the potential (38). Generally, the
equations of motion resulting from variation of VYM(X) are given by

then determines a ﬁeld theory for the Am’s on a noncommutative space.3,36 This
ﬁeld theory in fact corresponds to the noncommutative Yang-Mills gauge theory
which we will describe in the next Section.

3.3. String theory in magnetic ﬁelds

We can make the appearence of noncommutative geometry in string theory yet even
more precise by considering the analog in string theory37 of the Landau problem
for strong magnetic ﬁelds that we studied in detail in the previous Section. Let us
consider the worldsheet ﬁeld theory for open strings attached to D-branes, which is
deﬁned by a σ-model on the string worldsheet Σ whose ﬁelds yi are maps from Σ
into the Euclidean target spacetime describing the propagation of the strings. The
geometry of the target space is characterized by closed string supergravity ﬁelds,

we assume is non-degenerate. The action is

where ξa, a = 1, 2 are local coordinates on the surface Σ and ∂a = ∂/∂ξa. The
two-form Bij may be regarded as a magnetic ﬁeld on the D-branes.

In the case that the Bij are constant, the second term in (43) is a total derivative

which may be integrated by parts to give the boundary action

where t is the coordinate of the boundary ∂Σ of the string worldsheet residing on
the D-brane worldvolume, and ˙yi = ∂yi/∂t. This is formally the same action that
arose in the Landau problem in the strong ﬁeld limit, and hence we can expect that
quantization of the open string endpoint coordinates yi(t) will induce a noncommu-
tative geometry on the D-brane. One needs to be somewhat careful though as this
is not a theory of particles. There is still the ﬁrst term present in the σ-model action
(43) which describes the dynamics of the interiors of the open strings, or equiva-
lently the closed string sector of the theory. It reminds us that the point particles of
(44) are really the endpoints of open strings. In particular, the two ends of an open
string couple directly to a background B-ﬁeld and the string becomes polarized as
a dipole.

The remarkable observation is that there is a consistent low-energy limit, called
the Seiberg-Witten limit,7 which decouples all massive string modes at the same
time as scaling away the bulk part of the string worldsheet dynamics from its
boundary. It is deﬁned by scaling the spacetime metric as

(45)

(46)

while keeping ﬁxed the Neveu-Schwarz two-form ﬁeld Bij . Then the worldsheet
ﬁeld theory is eﬀectively described by the boundary action (44) alone and canonical
quantization produces the commutation relations

= i θij , θ = B−1

yi , yj

(cid:3)

on ∂Σ. Thus the D-brane worldvolume becomes a noncommutative space. Because
0 taken in (45), the eﬀective dynamics is governed
of the point particle limit ℓs →
in this limit as usual by a ﬁeld theory for the massless open string modes. Follow-
ing the analysis of the previous Section, we thus ﬁnd that the low-energy eﬀective
ﬁeld theories on D-branes get modiﬁed now to those deﬁned with noncommuting
coordinates, or equivalently by star-products of the ﬁelds. In this way, string theory
in the presence of D-branes naturally leads to ﬁeld theories on noncommutative
spaces. These models are the subject of the next Section. It should be stressed that,
as in the previous Section, noncommutative ﬁeld theories emerge here as eﬀective

descriptions of the string dynamics. An equivalent description is possible using or-
dinary theories on commutative spacetime.7 However, the noncommutative setting
is much more natural and both conceptually and computationally useful, and it
is from this formalism that the true Planck scale physics of string theory may be
captured by quantum ﬁeld theory.

4. Noncommutative Quantum Field Theory

One of the main interests in the emergence of ﬁeld theories on noncommutative
spaces in the manner described above is that they retain some of the non-locality
of string theory, yet seem to be well-deﬁned as ﬁeld theories. They thus present the
remarkable situation that many novel stringy features could be studied within the
simpler language of quantum ﬁeld theory. To what extent this is true is still to a
large extent an unresolved issue. For instance, at present, there still lacks a general,
systematic renormalization programme for handling such non-local ﬁeld theories.
These issues have addressed to all orders of perturbation theory in Refs. 38, 39, 40,
41. Nevertheless, they can be studied, and as ﬁeld theories the non-locality gives
them rather exotic features which challenge the conventional wisdom of ordinary
quantum ﬁeld theory. This is perhaps the greatest motivation for the extensive
study that they have seen, in that they are interesting on their own as potentially
well-deﬁned examples of non-local ﬁeld theories. In this Section we shall brieﬂy sur-
vey some of these interesting new features, indicating how they capture some of the
non-locality of quantum gravity and highlighting some of the main potential impli-
cations they could have on the structure of spacetime. We will assume throughout
that the noncommutative ﬁeld theories live on Euclidean spacetime. In Minkowski
signature, making time a noncommuting coordinate in the present context leads to
severe acausal eﬀects and conceptual diﬃculties such as the precise interpretation
of Hamiltonian evolution. It also leads to violations of unitarity and Lorentz invari-
ance, as we discuss in Section 4.4. A possible cure for this violation is suggested in
Ref. 42 by integrating over all background ﬁelds corresponding to noncommutativity
parameters θij . This sum over backgrounds is of course the natural recipe dictated
by string theory and quantum gravity, which are both unitary and covariant.

4.1. Fundamental aspects

For our purposes, we will deﬁne a noncommutative ﬁeld theory as an ordinary
ﬁeld theory whose commutative pointwise products of ﬁelds are replaced with the
noncommutative, associative star-product introduced in Section 2, i.e. we replace

f (x) g(x)

(f ⋆ g)(x) = f (x) exp

7−→

i

2 ←−∂i θij −→∂j
(cid:17)

g(x) ,

with (θij ) an invertible antisymmetric matrix. With respect to this product, an
elementary computation shows that the spacetime coordinates x = (xi) obey the
required commutation relations (1),

14 Richard J. Szabo

Under Fourier transformation of ﬁelds, the star-product (47) corresponds to the
modiﬁcation of the usual Fourier convolution product as

˜f (k) ˜g(q)

˜f (k) ˜g(q) e i k×q , k

q = ki θij qj ,

(49)

where the tildes denote Fourier transforms. The alteration (49) in momentum space
exempliﬁes the inherent non-locality of the star-product of ﬁelds. If θ is the av-
erage magnitude of a matrix element of (θij ), then 1/√θ is the energy threshold
beyond which a particle moves and interacts in a distorted spacetime. The product
deformation thus becomes eﬀective at energies E with E √θ
1, wherein not only
are the interactions between the ﬁelds signiﬁcantly modiﬁed, but so are the quanta
which mediate these interactions.

As an explicit example, let us consider the noncommutative φ4

where φ(x) is a real scalar ﬁeld on R4. Note that only interactions are modiﬁed

which is easily derived from the representation (47) via an integration by parts
(assuming appropriate decay behaviour of the ﬁelds at inﬁnity in R4). In scalar
ﬁeld theories such as this one, by using (49) one can easily compute interaction
vertices in momentum space as

along with the usual momentum conservation constraint

k1 + k2 + . . . + kn = 0 .

We see that the noncommutative vertex (52) is momentum dependent, in contrast
to the usual case whereby the tree-level vertex function would simply be equal to the
coupling constant λ. In particular, this modifed interaction vertex is only cyclically
invariant under permutations of the momenta kI , and so one needs to keep careful
track of the order of the momenta ﬂowing into the vertex, again in contrast to what
would occur in ordinary scalar ﬁeld theory.

It is well-known from multi-colour gauge theories and matrix models how to
keep track of the cyclic ordering.43,44 One doubles each line of a Feynman graph

Magnetic Backgrounds and Noncommutative Field Theory

into ribbons. The ribbon graphs now have topology associated to them, and one
can characterize them into two sets, called planar and non-planar.45,46,47 The
planar diagrams are those which can be drawn on the surface of a sphere or the
plane without crossing any of the ribbons. They are dynamically characterized by
the fact that the totality of the momenta of internal line contractions vanishes.
In this case the noncommutative phase factor (52) does not signiﬁcantly alter the
analytic expression for the corresponding amplitude. It is equal to the ordinary, θ =
0 commutative diagram, times a possible θ-dependent phase factor coming from the
external momenta of the graph. In particular, there is no change in the convergence
properties as compared to the commutative case. Much more interesting are the non-
planar diagrams, those which cannot be drawn on the surface of a sphere or the
plane. Dynamically, non-trivial internal momentum contractions remain, and these
graphs typically modify the ultraviolet behaviour in a signiﬁcant way.47 Naively,
the rapid phase oscillations of (52) suppress large momentum modes and would
appear to make the amplitude ultraviolet ﬁnite. As we will discuss in the next
Subsection, this is a subtle point, because the phase factors (52) become ineﬀective
at vanishing momenta, or equivalently the commutative ultraviolet divergence must
reappear at θ = 0 and the amplitude exhibits non-analytic behaviour as a function
of the noncommutativity parameter. This is a surprising feature of the quantum ﬁeld
theory, as the classical ﬁeld theory smoothly reduces to its commutative counterpart
at θ = 0.

4.2. UV/IR mixing

Let us now explore in a bit more detail the non-locality induced by noncommu-
tativity, and in particular the convergence properties of Feynman diagrams in the
quantum ﬁeld theory. At a semi-classical level, the non-locality of the star-product
(47) itself already produces exotic eﬀects. Suppose that f and g are wavepackets
√θ. One can then show, essen-
which are supported in a region of small size ∆
tially from the momentum representation of the star-product, that f ⋆ g is non-zero
in a large region of size θ/∆. An extreme example of this non-locality is provided
by the star-product of two inﬁnitely-localized delta-functions, which is constant
throughout space,

In other words, the behaviour of the ﬁeld theory at very short distances, where the
eﬀects of spacetime noncommutativity are signiﬁcant, inﬂuences its long wavelength
properties.

The eﬀect just described has rather profound consequences in the quantum ﬁeld
theory, and it leads to the famous UV/IR mixing property of noncommutative ﬁeld
theories.47 If a Feynman diagram requires an ultraviolet cutoﬀ Λ to regularize it,

16 Richard J. Szabo

then this automatically induces an eﬀective infrared cutoﬀ

Λ0 =

1
θ Λ

on the graph. We will describe below some of the remarkable consequences of this
mixing of energy scales, but let us ﬁrst point out a simple physical picture of this
eﬀect. As we did in (25), from the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorﬀ formula and the com-
mutation relation (48), one can straightforwardly compute

e i k·x ⋆ e i q·x ⋆ e − i k·x = e − i

2 k×q e i (k+q)·x ⋆ e − i k·x = e i qi(xi−θij kj ) .

(56)

By Fourier transformation, it then follows that star-conjugation of ﬁelds by plane
waves induces a non-local spacetime translation as

e i k·x ⋆ f (xi) ⋆ e − i k·x = f (xi

θij kj) .

−

We interpret (57) to mean that the quanta in noncommutative ﬁeld theory include
“dipoles”,48,49 i.e. extended, rigid objects whose length or electric dipole moment
∆xi grows with its center of mass momentum pj,

∆xi = θij pj .

These quanta are responsible for many of the stringy eﬀects that noncommutative
ﬁeld theories exhibit (c.f. (35)), and they are just like the electron-hole bound states
which arise in a strong magnetic ﬁeld. The dipoles interact by joining at their
ends, and this gives a simple picture of the non-local nature of the interactions in
noncommutative quantum ﬁeld theory.

Let now examine the UV/IR mixing property at a more quantitative level. Con-
sider again, for deﬁniteness, the noncommutative φ4
4 ﬁeld theory with action (50).
Using the steps described in the previous Subsection, one can work out the one-

clearly sees that the limits θ

clear separation of high and low momentum scales. The low-energy eﬀective ﬁeld
theory here does not decouple from the high-energy dynamics. The higher the cutoﬀ
Λ is, the more sensitive are the amplitudes to the lowest energies available.

4.3. Gauge interactions

Let us now study the example of noncommutative gauge theory which can be ex-
pected to tie in to the properties of our observable world, and which is also inspired
by the string theory applications that we described in the last Section.3,5,7 The
noncommutative Yang-Mills action for a U (N ) gauge ﬁeld Ai(x) on R4 is given by

SNCYM =

where

is the noncommutative ﬁeld strength tensor. The curvature (63) is a non-local de-

The action (62) is invariant under the noncommutative version of the usual gauge
transformations, leading to the star-gauge invariance

where U (x) is an N

U ⋆ Ai ⋆ U −1 + i U ⋆ ∂iU −1 ,

U ⋆ U † = U † ⋆ U = 11 .

The presence of the star-product in the gauge transformation rule (65) mixes
spacetime and colour degrees of freedom in an intricate way. In fact, noncommu-
tative gauge transformations in a certain sense generate the inﬁnite unitary group
).50 This implies that star-gauge invariance will contain geometrical symme-
U (
tries of the spacetime, in particular the symplectomorphisms of R4 with respect to
∂
the Poisson bi-vector θij ∂
∂xj . To understand this point, let us consider the
basic plane wave ﬁelds in the case N = 1,

Up to a global translation of Ai, which leaves invariant the ﬁeld strength tensor
(63), we see that spacetime translations are equivalent to gauge transformations in
noncommutative Yang-Mills theory.51 The only other known theory with such a
geometrical gauge symmetry is gravity, and we may thereby conclude that noncom-
mutative gauge theory provides a toy model of general relativity.

This translational symmetry can be naturally gauged within this framework,
and the noncommutative gauge theory can be thereby shown to reduce to a telepar-
allel formalism of general relativity.52 This feature ﬁts in well with the hope that
noncommutative gauge theories capture important stringy properties.53,54 A par-
ticularly important consequence of this spacetime-colour mixing is that there are
no local gauge-invariant operators in noncommutative Yang-Mills theory.46,47,51
From the appropriate analogs of Wilson line operators, it is in fact possible to
derive closed string, gravitational degrees of freedom from these open string non-
commutative gauge theories.55,56

4.4. Violations of special relativity

In this Subsection we will give an overview of some of the broad phenomenologi-
cal applications that spacetime noncommutativity may have. Let us ﬁrst observe
that noncommutative ﬁeld theories violate Lorentz invariance. In the string picture,
this violation is due to the expectation value of the supergravity ﬁeld Bij. Focus-
ing on the four-dimensional situation, the noncommutativity tensor θij provides a
directionality (θ)i = ǫijk θjk in space, within any ﬁxed inertial frame. Thus non-
commutative ﬁeld theory is not invariant under rotations or boosts of localized ﬁeld
conﬁgurations within a ﬁxed observer inertial frame of reference.

The orientation θ can be used to provide stringent constraints on the observable
magnitude of the noncommutativity parameters θij . Let us brieﬂy summarize a few
of the analyses that have been made:

(i) One can compare the noncommutative extension of the standard model with
certain Lorentz-violating extensions. Noncommutative ﬁeld theories are CPT
symmetric,57 hence so should be these commutative extensions. Comparison
with the known literature can be used to derive the bound58

θ < (10 TeV)−2

(71)

by using atomic clock comparison studies and a model for the 9Be nucleus
wavefunction.

(ii) We can also compare noncommutative quantum electrodynamics with some
of the more standard QED processes, by taking into account the motion of
the laboratory frame relative to θ. Among the many scenarios considered have

Magnetic Backgrounds and Noncommutative Field Theory

19

been high-energy e+e− and hadron scattering, CP-violation, the anomalous
magnetic moment (g
2)µ, and so on. A review of these phenomenological
applications is found in Ref. 59, where a complete list of references is also
given.

−

(iii) Finally, we can compare noncommutative QED with low-energy atomic tran-
sitions. For example, in the noncommutative version of the Lamb shift in
hydrogen,60 the leading modiﬁcation of the Coulomb potential is given by

(cid:1)

A recent overview of the various bounds obtained on spacetime noncommuta-
tivity is presented in Ref. 61.

Let us now turn to the phenomenological implications of UV/IR mixing. From
(59)–(61) we see that noncommutativity modiﬁes the standard dispersion relation
of special relativity to

E2 = k2 + m2 + ∆M 2

1
k θ (cid:19)

(cid:18)

,

where ∆M 2(Λ) is the ultraviolet divergent mass renormalization. The deformation
∆M 2 in (73) induces a violation of classical special relativity. We can compare this
formula to experimental measurements in the energy range

(72)

(73)

(74)

Λ0 < E < Λ =

θ Λ0

,

where Λ0 is an experimentally determined phenomenological infrared scale. This
implies that one can only compare the eﬀects of UV/IR mixing with very high
energy experimental data.

For example, the photon dispersion relation in noncommutative electrodynamics

is given by62

where θ⊥, B⊥ are the components of θ and a constant background magnetic induc-

To reproduce the bound (71), one would need to arrange a Michelson-Morley type
interferometry experiment with visible light, i.e. B of the order of a Tesla, and with
1018 cm, which is of the order of a parsec. This
leg lengths l1, l2 obeying l1 + l2 ≥
is probably impractical for galactic magnetic ﬁelds.15,62

θ⊥ = k

(75)

·

·

Finally, various cosmological comparisons can be made based on the deformed
dispersion relation (73).63 For example, in certain models of astrophysical gamma-
ray bursts, spacetime foam induces dispersion. This comes about from ultra-high
energy cosmic ray thresholds (the GZK cutoﬀ) on cosmic proton energies due to the
photopion production reaction p + γ
p + π with cosmic microwave background
radiation. Relations such as (73) can be used to explain the various puzzling and
paradoxical observations of cosmic rays.

5. The Fractional Quantum Hall Eﬀect

Having dispelled with our tour of the signiﬁcance of noncommutative ﬁeld theory
in high-energy physics, we will now go back to our motivating example of Section 2
and apply what we have learnt about these novel ﬁeld theories. A very precise
application of noncommutative ﬁeld theory is in fact to the fractional quantum Hall
eﬀect. A particular such model provides a mean ﬁeld theory description that is
far superior to its commutative version and which displays the correct quantitative
features expected from condensed matter physics.

5.1. The Laughlin wavefunction

Let us begin with a brief review of some basic and well-known facts about the mean
ﬁeld theory of the Landau problem.64 In the fractional quantum Hall eﬀect, the
interactions lead to a state similar to the ﬁlled lowest Landau level, but allowing
for fractionally charged quasi-particle excitations. Let m be a positive integer. The
ratio of the electron density to the density of the lowest Landau level is the ﬁlling
fraction ν, and at ν = 1
m a good microscopic description of such a state is provided
by the Ne-electron Laughlin wavefunction65

(ii) Fractional exchange statistics, i.e. a 2π rotation of the relative coordinate of a
two-quasi-particle state multiplies the state by the phase factor e 2π i /m.

The low-energy excitations of the ground state may be described by a Landau-
Ginzburg theory of a superﬂuid density φ minimally coupled to a ﬁctitious abelian
vector potential Ai in 2 + 1 dimensions.66 The original quasi-particles are magnetic
vortex solutions of this model, while their fractional statistics is reproduced by
including in the action an abelian Chern-Simons term for the gauge potential,

The Gauss law for this gauge-matter coupled theory implies that a vortex of unit
magnetic charge also carries electric charge 1
m . The Aharonov-Bohm phase factors
about the magnetic vortex then lead to the appropriate fractional statistics. This
model eﬀectively describes the Landau problem as a quantum Hall ﬂuid in terms of
a hydrodynamical gauge theory.67,68

5.2. Noncommutative Chern-Simons theory

We will now demonstrate that the noncommutative version of the Chern-Simons
action (78) leads directly to a very eﬃcient description of the quasi-particle
excitations,9 in which the elevation of the hydrodynamic gauge theory to a non-
commutative gauge theory captures the graininess of the quantum Hall ﬂuid. The
primary motivation a priori for making the spatial directions r = (x1, x2) noncom-
muting variables resides in our analysis of Section 2. The time coordinate x0 = t is
left as an ordinary commutative variable. The action is deﬁned by

(cid:1)

It is invariant under the usual noncommutative gauge transformations U in (65,66)
which are trivial at spatial inﬁnity,69 i.e. U (t, r)
. In the temporal
gauge A0 = 0, the action (79) is formally the same as its commutative counter-
part (78), i.e.

However, now the Gauss law, i.e. the equation of motion for A0, involves the non-

The crucial observation now is that the action and constraint arise from a matrix

Dt = ∂t −
matrix Chern-Simons theory. To establish its equivalence with the noncommutative
gauge theory deﬁned by (79), we write (82) in the A0 = 0 gauge to get

and note that the constraint arising from varying the action (82) with respect to

22 Richard J. Szabo

In particular, as we discussed earlier, the X i are necessarily inﬁnite-dimensional
matrices with N

, i.e. operators acting on a separable Hilbert space.

Let us now expand the action (83) and constraint (84) about a particular time-

independent solution yi, as we did in (42), i.e. we write

(85)

(86)

(87)

(88)

with

yi’s act on functions of y alone as

yi , yj
(cid:2)

yi , f (y)
(cid:3)
(cid:2)

We then use the usual Weyl-Wigner correspondence of noncommutative ﬁeld
theory,14 which generally reﬂects the fact that noncommutative ﬁelds are most
naturally thought of as operators acting on a separable Hilbert space. It makes the
association

where the left-hand side of (88) is a trace over inﬁnite-dimensional operators while
the right-hand side is a spatial integration over functions on R2. By substituting
(85)–(88) into (83) and (84), we arrive at the noncommutative Chern-Simons action
(80) with its constraint (81). Thus the matrix model (82) expanded about the
background X i = yi as above is exactly equivalent to noncommutative U (1) Chern-
Simons gauge theory. This equivalence is completely analogous to the way in which
noncommutative Yang-Mills theory (62) is derived from the Yang-Mills potential
(38) via expansion of matrices about a noncommutative background.3,36

However, as it presently stands, the matrix quantum mechanics expanded about
the noncommutative background describes a system with inﬁnitely many degrees of
freedom. We can remedy the situation, and hence describe a quantum Hall droplet of
ﬁnite size, by introducing a ﬁnite-dimensional version of the matrix Chern-Simons
theory (82) deﬁned by the matrix-vector U (N ) gauged quantum mechanics with
action10

where again X i, i = 1, 2 are N
N time-dependent Hermitian matrices. The second
term in the action (89) is a harmonic oscillator potential for the X i’s, while ΦI
transforms as a complex N -vector under the gauge group U (N ). The crucial point
here is that ﬁnite N dimensional representations of the classical vacua are now
possible, with N = Ne identiﬁed as the number of electrons residing in the lowest
Landau level. To see this, we note that the A0 constraint now selects a sector of

particular Φ-charge equal to m. We can solve these constraints classically using
the U (N ) symmetry of the model to make X 1 diagonal and ΦI real. This results
in a system with N real degrees of freedom and a residual permutation symmetry
generated by the Weyl subgroup of U (N ), acting by permuting the entries of X 1
and ΦI .

In this way, the constrained ﬁnite N matrix Chern-Simons theory (89) reduces to
the Calogero model for N identical particles moving in one dimension,70,71 which
is deﬁned by the quantum mechanical Hamiltonian

A ground state of this Hamiltonian is precisely the Laughlin wavefunction (76), with
xI = Re(zI ). One can continue this and identify all excited Calogero states with
excited Laughlin quasi-particle wavefunctions in a one-to-one manner.11 We con-
clude that the ﬁnite N
N matrix Chern-Simons theory is a theory of N composite
fermions in the lowest Landau level. The quasi-particles are well-deﬁned excitations
of the noncommutative Chern-Simons gauge ﬁeld.

Coming at the noncommutative gauge theory from the string theory side, it
can be shown that certain conﬁgurations of D-branes in superstring theory exhibit
the physics of the fractional quantum Hall eﬀect.72 The D2-brane eﬀective gauge
theory, in a certain generalization of the Seiberg-Witten scaling limit,7 implies the
eﬀective noncommutative gauge theory described above. In particular, the role of
the electrons in the quantum Hall ﬂuid is played by D0-branes, and the large N D0-
brane matrix model in this way induces the ﬁnite matrix Chern-Simons theory. This
provides a string theory derivation of the proposal that the ground state of the frac-
tional quantum Hall ﬂuid is described by a noncommutative Chern-Simons gauge
theory.9 In this way, string theory can present eﬀective long wavelength descriptions
of certain condensed matter phenomena, and noncommutative ﬁeld theory provides
a surprising bridge between these two seemingly disparate developments in physics.

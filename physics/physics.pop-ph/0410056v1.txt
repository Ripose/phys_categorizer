Abstract

We have performed angle-resolved measurements of spontaneous-emission spectra from laser dyes

and quantum dots in opal and inverse opal photonic crystals. Pronounced directional dependen-

cies of the emission spectra are observed: angular ranges of strongly reduced emission adjoin with

angular ranges of enhanced emission. It appears that emission from embedded light sources is af-

fected both by the periodicity and by the structural imperfections of the crystals: the photons are

Bragg diﬀracted by lattice planes and scattered by unavoidable structural disorder. Using a model

comprising diﬀuse light transport and photonic band structure, we quantitatively explain the di-

rectional emission spectra. This provides detailed understanding of the transport of spontaneously

emitted light in real photonic crystals, which is essential in the interpretation of quantum-optics

in photonic band-gap crystals and for applications wherein directional emission and total emission

power are controlled.

INTRODUCTION

Photonic crystals attract much attention both in academia and in industry because they

oﬀer exciting ways of manipulating photons [1]. Periodic variations of the refractive index

in photonic crystals on a length scale of the wavelength of light cause optical Bragg diﬀrac-

tion and organize the photon dispersion relation in bands, analogous to electron bands in

semiconductors [2, 3, 4]. Frequency windows, called stop gaps, appear in which there are

no modes for certain propagation directions. Photonic structures already serve as a base

for controlling the propagation of light. Of even greater interest are three-dimensional (3D)

photonic crystals that summon novel opportunities in the case of a photonic band gap (PBG)

- a frequency range where no modes exist at all. The existence of a gap in the density of

photonic modes leads to novel quantum-optical phenomena such as spontaneous emission

inhibition, light localization [2, 3, 4, 5, 6].

Control over the radiative decay rate of spontaneous emission is of keen interest for

applications, and therefore emission properties of sources such as atoms, dyes, and quantum

dots are intensively investigated. According to Fermi’s ‘Golden Rule’, this decay rate is

proportional to the local radiative density of states (LDOS) that counts the number of

electromagnetic modes wherein photons can be emitted at a speciﬁc location of the source.

In 3D photonic crystals pronounced variations of the LDOS with frequency are predicted

even in the absence of a PBG [7, 8], which give rise to angle-independent variations of the

total emission. Recently LDOS eﬀects on spontaneous emission have been experimentally

demonstrated: Using inverse opals photonic crystals considerable variations of the emission

rates in large band widths were obtained in both continuous-wave (cw) total-emission power

experiments [9] and in time-resolved lifetime experiments [10]. While lifetime experiments

provide a direct measurement of decay rates, it is important to quantitatively interpret

concomitant emission spectra, for instance, to conﬁrm that light sources inside the crystal

are probed. Cw experiments, on the other hand, rely on a comparison of angle-integrated

spectra with a homogeneous medium. In the latter case a complete understanding of all

angle-dependent eﬀects, that is, Bragg diﬀraction on the propagation of light is crucial. In

this paper such a quantitative analysis is presented.

In contrast to decay rates, emission spectra of sources embedded in photonic crystals

are strongly directional [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. Particular frequency ranges of the spectra

2

are suppressed in certain directions forming stop gaps, whose center frequencies and the

widths are described by the photon dispersion relation. Besides Bragg diﬀraction, which is

an eﬀect of the order of the periodic structure, light propagating inside the structure also

feels disorder: polydispersity, roughness and misarrangements of the building blocks [17].

This unavoidable disorder aﬀects the interference-induced properties of photonic crystals.

Previous work on the eﬀect of disorder on spontaneous emission includes the realization

that disorder determines the depth of stop gaps [13, 15] and the observation of disorder-

induced enhanced emission in the range of ﬁrst and second-order stop gaps [18]. While the

propagation of light from external light sources has been studied in great detail [19, 20], a

quantitative explanation of the behavior of light emission from internal sources has lacked

sofar.

Here we present strongly frequency-dependent angular distributions of spontaneous emis-

sion from a laser dye in polystyrene opals and from quantum dots in titania inverse opals

in the frequency range around the ﬁrst-order Bragg diﬀraction (L-gap). We compare the

data to a theoretical model that uniﬁes eﬀects of structural disorder and photonic crys-

tal properties [21]. Angle-dependent internal reﬂection due to the photonic gaps plays a

key role in our model. The theory quantitatively explains both the enhancement and the

reduction of light along certain propagation directions that were observed experimentally.

The excellent agreement conﬁrms that the propagation of light in a photonic crystal is well

understood for frequencies around the L-gap. Furthermore, we show that by analyzing the

exit emission distributions, one can reveal stop gaps in the quantum dot spectra. Such

an analysis should be carefully performed before any quantum-optical experiments since it

unambiguously proves the eﬀect of the photonic crystal on emission. We ﬁnally discuss the

applicability of photonic crystals for improvement of the emission eﬃciency of light sources.

II. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

A. Samples

We have studied emission from dyes in polystyrene opals and from quantum dots in

titania inverse opals. The polystyrene opals are fcc crystals of close-packed polystyrene

spheres prepared from a colloidal suspension by self-assembly. The titania inverse opals are

3

fcc structures of close-packed air spheres in a solid matrix of TiO2. Details of the preparation

and characterization of the opals and inverse opals can be found in Ref.

[22]. We have

studied 4 polystyrene samples with lattice parameters a = 178 ± 3 and 365 ± 5 nm and

8 titania samples with lattice parameters a = 370, 420, 500, 580, and 650 ± 10 nm. All

samples have typical dimensions of 2x2x0.2 mm3 and contain high-quality domains with

diameters larger than 50 µm. These domains have ﬂat faces normal to the 111 crystal axis,

which is evident from SEM images. The other crystalline axes are randomly oriented.

The polystyrene opals were doped with the laser dye Rhodamine 6G (R6G) by immersing

them into a dilute solution (10−6 mol/l) of the dye in ethanol. We estimate to have about

10 dye molecules per sphere. This number is suﬃciently low to avoid reabsorption or energy

transfer processes [23]. Afterwards the samples were rinsed in ethanol and dried. In order

to ensure that the emission was recorded only from the bulk of the crystal, and not from

the crystal surface, the dye absorbed near the surface was bleached [13]. The whole surface

was illuminated by an intense laser beam at the Bragg angle for the pump frequency. At

this angle the pump intensity decreases exponentially with depth, which implies that the

dye bleaches within the ﬁrst few crystal layers.

The titania inverse opals were inﬁltrated for 24 hours with a colloidal suspension of

ZnSe-coated CdSe quantum dots [24, 25] in a mixture of 50% chloroform and 50% butanol.

Afterwards the samples were rinsed in chloroform and dried. The concentration of the

inﬁltrating solution was 10−7 mol/l. In order to minimize oxidation and contamination of

the quantum dots, the inverse opals doped with quantum dots were prepared in a nitrogen-

purged glove box and held in a sealed chamber under a 1.7 mbar nitrogen atmosphere during

the optical measurements.

B. Experimental set-up

Figure 1 shows the experimental set-up used to measure emission from light sources

inside photonic crystals. The sources inside the crystal are excited by a cw Ar-ion laser

(λ = 497 nm) with the power at the sample below 10 µW. To focus the pump beam on

the sample surface a ﬁber-coupled microscope objective is used. The beam is focused to

a spot of about 30 µm in diameter at an incident angle θp, usually θp ≈ 250.

In order

to acquire emission spectra as a function of the detection angle θe relative to the surface

4

normal, the sample is mounted on a rotation stage. The surface normal is parallel to the

111 reciprocal lattice vector G111. In order to illuminate the same area irrespective of θe,

the ﬁber-coupled objective (O1) is mounted on the same rotation stage as the sample. In

this way, the angle of incidence θp between the pump beam and the surface normal is kept

constant. The advantage over previous experiments, where the sample was rotated with

respect to both the pump and detection beams, is that the absolute intensity of the angle-

dependent spectra can be reliably compared. The position of the pump spot on the sample

is monitored with a microscope. The emitted light is collected within a cone of 150 full

width around the angle θe, imaged on the slit of the spectrometer with 4 nm resolution,

and detected by the photomultiplier tube (PMT). The angle-resolved spectra are usually

measured at the detection angles from 00 to 750 at intervals of 150. The measured spectra

are corrected for the dark count of the PMT. The shapes of the spectra are conﬁrmed to be

independent of the pump intensity, and the emitted intensity is linear with the pump power.

III. DIFFUSE LIGHT TRANSPORT IN PHOTONIC CRYSTALS

A. Escape function

In real photonic structures, defects in the arrangement of the building blocks are always

present and cause random multiple scattering of light. This means that all light emitted

in such photonic structures becomes diﬀuse on length scales equal to the transport mean

free path l, which is often much smaller than the thickness of the sample L. For example,

our opals and inverse opals have mean free paths of about 15 µm, whereas the thickness

of the samples is about 200 µm [26]. Thus, even though emission inside a photonic crystal

is diﬀracted by the crystal structure, this eﬀect is smeared out by the random multiple

scattering while the light propagates through the bulk. Only at distances from the surface z

smaller than l, where photons emanate ballistically towards the crystal-air interface after a

last scattering event, the eﬀect of Bragg diﬀraction is not destroyed by the scattering. Hence

the diﬀuse emission acquires a directional dependence only when it exits the crystal [21].

We consider the ratio of the mean free path l to the attenuation length for Bragg diﬀrac-

tion LB in order to estimate the attenuation of emission caused by Bragg diﬀraction as

proposed in Ref.

[15]. Since the mean free path l is larger than the Bragg attenuation

5

length LB (typically l/LB ∼ 2 − 5 [26]), an attenuation in the stop band equal to 1 − LB/l

= 50% to 80% is predicted, in agreement with our observations.

In the present work we investigate directional properties of light emitted by sources from

3D photonic crystals and compare to a model of diﬀuse light transmission through opaque

media [27, 28, 29] extended to photonic crystals [21]. Based on the diﬀusion theory, the

intensity of light I(ω, µe) with frequency ω that exits the sample at external angles between
θe = cos−1(µe) and cos−1(µe + dµe) relative to the surface normal is equal to

I(ω, µe)dµe = Itot(ω)P (ω, µe)dµe.

(1)

Here Itot(ω) is the total spontaneous emission power that is the spectrum of the light sources

integrated over the exit angles θe. For sources with a low quantum eﬃciency or with inho-

mogeneously broadened spectra, Itot(ω) is proportional to the LDOS [9]. The distribution

P (ω, µe) is deﬁned as

where ne and ni are average refractive indices outside and inside the sample [30], respec-

coeﬃcients, that yield an angle-averaged internal-reﬂection coeﬃcient ¯R(ω):

From diﬀusion theory, ¯R(ω) determines the so-called extrapolation length that sets the

boundary conditions of the diﬀuse intensity [27, 28, 29]. The normalized function P (ω, µe)

describes the distribution of emission intensity over the escape angles and will be called

the ‘escape function’. In absence of reﬂection eﬀects, the escape distibution tends to the

well-known Lambertian distribution of diﬀuse surfaces.

The angular dependence of the escape function P (ω, µe) agrees well with experiments on

random media, if an average refractive index and Fresnel’s reﬂection coeﬃcients are used

to model R(ω, µi) [28, 29].

In random media such as powders or macroporous sponges

the internal-reﬂection coeﬃcient R(ω, µi) is barely frequency dependent [31]. However, for

highly dispersive photonic crystals Fresnel’s model cannot describe the internal reﬂection.

Light escaping from a depth z < l from the crystal surface is Bragg attenuated for angles and

frequencies matching the Bragg condition. Hence a strongly angle and frequency-dependent

internal reﬂection due to the photonic band structure plays a key role in the escape distri-

bution of diﬀuse emission.

B.

Internal-reﬂection coeﬃcient

In order to model the internal-reﬂection coeﬃcient R(ω, µi), we have taken into considera-

tion calculated photonic band structures. Figure 2(a) shows the photonic band structure for

polystyrene opals calculated along the LU and LK lines in reciprocal space in the frequency

range around the ﬁrst-order stop gap (L-gap) that is due to optical Bragg diﬀraction by (111)

planes parallel to the sample surface. The emission spectrum of R6G is in the low-frequency

limit relative to the stop bands of opals with a lattice parameter a = 178 nm (region conﬁned

by the orange dash-dot-dotted lines). Consequently, this sample is eﬀectively homogeneous

for the emission frequencies, and therefore it can serve as a reliable reference. For these

nonphotonic crystals we used Fresnel’s model in order to describe the internal reﬂection. In

Figure 2(a) one can also see the frequency gap between the two lowest bands (blue dashed

curves), which obeys Bragg’s law (red curve) within the frequency range of R6G emission

for the opals with a lattice parameter a = 365 nm (region conﬁned by the green dash-dotted

lines). Therefore, the angular dependence of the center frequency of the L-gap is modelled

with the red curve, i.e.: ωC(µi) = ωC(µi = 1)/µi. To investigate the frequency dependence

of the reﬂectivity, we have performed reﬂectivity experiments on the samples using external

incident plane waves, since this technique reveals the center frequencies and the widths of

stop gaps [20, 32]. Figure 2(b) shows a normal-incidence reﬂectivity spectrum measured

from an opal with the lattice parameter a = 365 nm (blue circles). The reﬂectivity peak is

not ﬁtted well with a Gaussian (red dashed curve). As an improved model, we propose a

modiﬁed Gaussian (Fig. 2(b), black curve):

R1(ω, µi) = A1(µi) exp

(ω − ωC(µi))4
,
2(∆ωC(µi))4 i

−

h

(5)

where A1(µi) is the magnitude of the internal-reﬂection coeﬃcient and ∆ωC(µi) is the width

parameter. This peak shape is seen to ﬁt the measurements well for frequencies > 16000

cm−1. At low frequencies below 16000 cm−1 a deviation from the model is observed. We

7

attribute this deviation to Fresnel’s reﬂection, which is important only in the low-frequency

limit and therefore is not relevant for the escape function of photonic samples. The width

of the L-gap ∆ωC(µi) hardly varies with µi within the range of the dye emission, therefore

it is taken to be constant in our model. The magnitude of the internal-reﬂection coeﬃcient

A1(µi) decreases with µi because at larger internal angles θi = cos−1(µi) the path length for

the light to become Bragg attenuated increases with µi, and this increases the probability of

scattering at z < LB. The value of A1(µi) at µi = 1 is consistent with the normal-incidence
reﬂectivity experiment. Thus, we have: A1(µi) = A1(µi = 1) · µi and A1(µi = 1) = 0.7, see

Fig. 2(b).

Emitted light that is scattered within a distance LB < z < l towards the exit interface,
can also be redirected by Bragg diﬀraction by the sets of (11¯1) planes, which are oriented

at θi = 70.50 to the (111) planes and the surface normal. The internal-reﬂection coeﬃcient
R2(ω, µi) for Bragg diﬀraction by (11¯1) lattice planes is modelled similarly to R1(ω, µi).

Taking into account that we measure emission from many randomly-oriented crystal domains

in azimuthal directions, the reﬂectivity R2(ω, θi) is averaged over the azimuthal angles φ

between the LK and LU lines in reciprocal space, yielding:

R2(ω, θi) =

The magnitude A2(θi, φ) is modelled as A2(θi, φ) = A2(70.50, 00) · cos(θi − 70.50) · cos(φ)
with A2(70.50, 00) = 0.7. The total internal-reﬂection coeﬃcient R(ω, µi) is calculated as a
sum of the R1(ω, µi) and R2(ω, cos(θi − 70.50)) modiﬁed Gaussian peaks. We expect this

model of the angle- and frequency-dependent internal reﬂectivity to capture the essential

frequency dependence of the ﬁrst-order photonic stop gaps in polystyrene opals.

In the case of the titania inverse opals we apply the same escape model to explain our

experimental data. However, in calculating the internal-reﬂection coeﬃcient R(ω, µi), Bragg

diﬀraction from other lattice planes must also be included. This diﬀerence compared to

polystyrene opals appears since titania inverse opals are more strongly photonic and the

measurements were performed at higher reduced frequencies (a/λ = ωa/2πc). Moreover,

the resulting stop gaps occur at lower detection angles θe in these crystals than in the

polystyrene opals, as a consequence of the lower average refractive index. Therefore Bragg’s

law is not a suﬃcient approximation of the angular dependence of the stop gap and a band

structure model is employed. In the model we take into account multiple gaps from (111)

8

and (200) lattice planes. For the inverse opals, this model was already successfully tested

on diﬀuse transmission experiments [21].

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Spontaneous emission of R6G in polystyrene opals

Reﬂectivity measurements at normal incidence of polystyrene opals (Fig. 2(b)) reveal

that the relative width of the ﬁrst-order stop gap is ∆ω/ω ≈ 0.075. For opals with a lattice

parameter a = 365 nm this means a stop band in the range 16100 - 17300 cm−1 for light

escaping the crystal normally to the surface. The dye R6G emits in the range of 15000 -

20000 cm−1, and hence we expect to observe directional-dependent emission of the dye from

the opals with a = 365 nm. Figure 3(a) displays the emission spectra at selected detection

angles for such doped opals. It is clearly seen that the shapes of the spectra are aﬀected by

the photonic crystal. The emission is suppressed by the crystal for θe = 00 in the spectral
range from 16000 to 17500 cm−1. With increasing angle θe the low-frequency parts of the

emission recover, and the suppressed emission range shifts to higher frequencies, as expected

from Bragg’s law for a photonic stop gap from a single set of lattice planes. In contrast, the

shape of the spectra from an opal with a lattice parameter a = 178 nm remains unchanged

(Fig. 3(b)). The sample is not photonic for the frequency range considered: the frequencies

of R6G emission lie far below the ﬁrst-order stop gap in the opal with this lattice parameter.

Before studying spontaneous emission from photonic samples we have veriﬁed the applica-

bility of the above-mentioned model of diﬀuse light transport on the nonphotonic, reference

samples. We use Fresnel’s reﬂection to describe the angular-dependent internal-reﬂection co-

eﬃcient, taking an average refractive index nav = 1.44, which is derived from the polystyrene

ﬁlling fraction ϕ ≈ 74% in opals and the refractive index of polystyrene n = 1.59. We record

the intensity at the maximum of the emission spectrum as a function of the exit angle θe
relative to the measurement at θe = 00. The relative intensity I(θe) is compared to the

escape function P (θe) in Figure 4. While the expected decrease with angle is observed, it

is clear that the calculated intensity diﬀers systematically from the measured data. This

deviation appears to be caused by an angle-dependent detection eﬃciency as a result of

an increase with θe of the projection of the spectrometer slit on the sample. Correcting

9

the measured intensity I(ω, µe) for the detection eﬃciency D(µe) (see Appendix) yields the

corrected intensity Ic(ω, µe) = I(ω, µe)/D(µe) displayed as red symbols in Fig. 4. The agree-

ment between the corrected intensity and the calculated escape function is excellent. With

the proper account of the detection eﬃciency, the angular distribution of emission escaping

the reference samples is thus fully understood. In all experimental data presented in the

remainder of this paper the detection eﬃciency has been included.

In the case of the photonic samples the exit distribution of emission strongly depends

on the frequency ω as mentioned above: P (ω, θe) = Ic(ω, θe)/Itot(ω). The total emission

spectrum Itot(ω) is determined by discretely summing the angle-resolved spectra Ic(ω, θe)

weighted by 2π sin(θe)dθe to approximate the integration over 2π solid angle. The spectra

from Figure 3(a) divided by the total emission spectrum Itot(ω) are plotted in Figure 5

(symbols) together with the calculated escape function P (ω, θe) (curves). We observe a

good agreement between our experiment and theory. The escape function hardly varies

with frequency in the low-frequency region ≤ 15600 cm−1, while it still depends on the

detection direction. In contrast, at higher frequencies strong variations are seen compared

to the low-frequency range. At the exit angle θe = 00, the escape function is signiﬁcantly
reduced in the spectral range from 16000 to 17500 cm−1 by the stop gap centered at ω =

16700 cm−1 due to internal Bragg diﬀraction, which is described by the term (1 − R(ω, µi))

in Eq. (2). The change of the center frequency as well as the decrease in the attenuation of

emission inside the stop gap with increasing exit angle θe are well described in our model by
the frequency and angular dependent internal-reﬂection coeﬃcient R(ω, µi). At θe = 600,

the stop gap has moved out of the spectral range of R6G.

Figure 5 also shows a peculiar feature: the frequency ranges where the emission is inhib-

ited along certain directions, adjoin with the ranges where emission is increased along the

same directions. Such an increase appears at the blue side of the stop gap at θe = 00 and 300,
and at the red side of the stop gap at θe = 450 and 600. This enhanced escape probability
in the frequency range 16000 - 19500 cm−1 along directions that do not coincide with the

stop gap is reﬂected in our model for P (ω, µe) (Eq. (2)) as an increase of the angle-averaged
internal-reﬂection coeﬃcient ¯R(ω). The good agreement between experiments and theory

conﬁrms a qualitative attribution of such enhancements to diﬀuse escape eﬀects [18], while

it refutes earlier propositions of Bragg standing wave eﬀects [33].

In Figure 6 we compare the experimentally determined intensity distributions (symbols)

10

for several ﬁxed frequencies with the calculated ones (solid curves) as functions of the exit

angle θe. The experimental values of P (θe) were obtained by dividing the emission Ic(θe)

by the total emission spectrum Itot and correcting for the angular aperture of the collecting
lens ΩL. For the frequency ω = 15000 cm−1, below the stop gap, the distribution follows the

Lambertian distribution and is similar to the exit distribution from the nonphotonic sample

(Fig. 4). For the frequencies above the red edge of the stop gap we observe strongly non-

Lambertian behaviour. For the frequency ω = 16500 cm−1 emission is suppressed relative to

the Lambertian distribution in the range of the exit angles from θe = 00 to 200. This range
moves to larger exit angles for the frequency ω = 17400 cm−1 in qualitative agreement with

Bragg’s law. For ω = 18350 cm−1 the suppression observed around θe = 400 is preceded by
a considerable increase of emission in the angle range 00 to 200. A qualitative explanation

of this eﬀect is as follows. Some escape directions are blocked by internal Bragg diﬀraction,

and diﬀusion eventually distributes this back-reﬂected light along the remaining directions.

Thus, light is more likely to exit the crystal along these allowed directions. From Figures 5

and 6 we conclude that the escape function is in excellent agreement with the measured

angle-dependent spectra. To the best of our knowledge, the current work provides the ﬁrst

quantitative modelling of spontaneous emission spectra in 3D photonic crystals.

B. Spontaneous emission of quantum dots in titania inverse opals

Titania inverse opals possess a larger relative width of the ﬁrst-order stop gap (∆ω/ω ≈

0.16) than the polystyrene opals owing to their inverse structure and high refractive index

contrast (m = 2.7). The concomitant large modiﬁcations of the LDOS makes the inverse

opals very attractive for control of propagation and spontaneous emission of light [9, 10].

Figure 7 shows emission spectra of CdSe quantum dots in a titania inverse opal with lattice

parameter a = 500 nm for selected detection angles θe. No signiﬁcant changes in the spectral

shapes due to internal Bragg diﬀraction are observed, because the relative spectral width

of the light sources (∆ω/ω < 0.06) is considerably smaller than the width of the stop gap

of the photonic crystal. This shows that the escape distribution P (ω, θe) does not vary

signiﬁcantly within the frequency range of the quantum dot spectrum. In contrast, a strong

angular dependence of the emission intensity is apparent in Fig. 7. As a consequence, eﬀects

of Bragg diﬀraction are most convincingly observed by recording the angular dependencies

11

at the spectral maxima of the emission spectra.

In Figure 8(a) we present escape distributions from titania inverse opals with lattice

parameters a = 370 and 420 nm at frequency ω = 16390 cm−1, and with a lattice parameter

a = 500 nm at ω = 15870 cm−1. Both measured (symbols) and calculated (curves) values

are shown. For the crystal with the lattice parameter a = 370 nm, for which the center

frequency of the quantum dot spectrum lies below the stop gap, the escape function follows

the Lambertian distribution. A large deviation from the Lambertian distribution is observed

for the quantum dot emission from the crystals with the other two lattice parameters. In the

crystals with a = 420 nm, the emission is strongly reduced in the range of the angles from

θe = 00 to 350, and it is enhanced at higher exit angles. For the crystals with a = 500 nm,
the suppression is shifted to the range of θe = 200 to 450, as expected for photonic gaps at

higher reduced frequency (a/λ = ωa/2πc), and in excellent with our theoretical predictions.

The stop-band ranges are noticeably wider than that in the case of the polystyrene opals

(Fig. 6), which is due to a wider frequency range of the stop gap in the titania inverse opals.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst demonstration of photonic crystal gaps in the

emission spectra of conﬁned excitons in quantum dots.

Figure 8(b) shows the photonic band structure for a titania inverse opal. The hatched

regions indicate the stop band caused by Bragg diﬀraction by (111) lattice planes. In the

angular range from θe = 350 to 550, multiple Bragg wave coupling from (111) and (200)

diﬀracted waves takes place [15, 34]. The horizontal color bars represent the reduced center

frequencies of the quantum dot emission from the inverse opals with the lattice parameters

a = 370, 420, 500, 580, and 650 nm. The colors of the bars indicate the measured values

of the escape function P (ω, θe). For reduced frequency ranges in the range of stop gaps, it

is apparent that reduced escape probability appears in the angular ranges of stop bands,

whereas enhanced escape appears in ranges outside the stop bands: the light is ’squeezed’

out of the crystal in the remaining allowed directions.

For experiments on quantum dot emission in photonic crystals, the good agreement be-

tween the experimentally obtained escape distributions and the calculated ones conﬁrms

that the light emanating from inside the crystals is diﬀuse. It also conﬁrms that the ob-

served emission is dominated by sources inside the bulk of the crystal. We can exclude

that light sources on the sample surface contribute signiﬁcantly: their emission would give

rise to an angle-independent component of the intensity that is not observed. Therefore,

12

the spontaneous emission rates from the sources is determined by photonic LDOS eﬀects.

This observation is important for successful lifetime experiments or other quantum-optical

studies of light sources in photonic crystals.

Based on the close accordance of the experiments with the model, we can extract the
angle-averaged internal-reﬂection coeﬃcient ¯R(ω). Figure 9 shows that ¯R(ω) is as large as

50% for the titania inverse opals and up to 20% for the polystyrene opals. The internal-

reﬂection coeﬃcient varies strongly with frequency in contrast to the frequency-independent
¯R in random media. The coeﬃcient increases with solid angle for Bragg reﬂection, starting
from the low-frequency edge of the L-gap. For the opals, the maximum ¯R occurs at the

high-frequency edge of the L-gap, where the reﬂecting stop gaps extend over the largest
solid angle [32]. For the inverse opals, the maximum ¯R occurs at higher reduced frequencies

in the range of multiple Bragg wave coupling (ωa/2πc ∼ 0.85) [15]. The shoulder near 1.0

is attributed to the inclusion of (200) reﬂection condition in our model. In a more elaborate

escape-model with additional diﬀraction conditions, we may expect additional peaks in

the angle-averaged reﬂection coeﬃcient at even higher frequencies. Since the inverse opals

interact stronger with light than the opals, their stop gaps are wider and hence the angle

averaged reﬂectivity is larger, in agreement with our observations.

A closer consideration of the reﬂectivity coeﬃcients can serve to optimize the sponta-

neous emission yield of light sources (atoms, dyes or quantum dots) embedded inside thick

photonic crystals (L > l). Such an optimization can be achieved either via the excitation

of the sources, via their emission, or both. First, the excitation eﬃciency can be increased

by realizing that increased escape probability also implies an increased probability for exci-

tation light to enter a photonic crystal. Thus, by tuning an excitation beam to frequencies

and angles of high escape, the combined action of diﬀusion and Bragg diﬀraction retain

relatively more excitation light inside the sample, thus increasing the probability for spon-

taneous emission of the embedded light sources. Secondly, spontaneously emitted radiation

is eﬃciently channeled out of the sample along particular directions. This occurs when the

lattice parameter of the photonic crystal is chosen such that the emission frequencies are in
the range of enhanced ¯R(ω). A clear example of enhanced escape is apparent in Fig. 5 at
θe = 00 near 18000 cm−1. In the ultimate case of a photonic band gap, it has even been

predicted that the diﬀuse emission is extremely directional, see Ref. [21]. Thirdly, one can

envision situations where both excitation and emission are enhanced: In Fig. 8(b) enhanced

13

escape probability occurs both at ωa/2πc ∼ 0.85 and θe = 00 and at ωa/2πc ∼ 0.7 and
θe = 500. Thus, by tuning the excitation to the former condition and the emission to the

latter, the spontaneous emission yield is expected to be enhanced by at least a factor of two.
Further improvements should be feasible in photonic crystals with even larger ¯R.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have presented experimental data on angular resolved emission from light sources

embedded in eﬃcient 3D photonic crystals. The experiments were compared in detail to

a recently developed model of light transport in real photonic crystals that are inﬂuenced

by disorder. Our model is based on diﬀusion of light due to scattering (disorder) combined

with angle- and frequency-dependent internal reﬂections (order). Good quantitative agree-

ment between experiment and theory conﬁrms that the details of the emission spectra are

determined by the intricate interplay of order and disorder. Properties of the stop gaps,

such as their frequency range, magnitude, and angular dependence, are extracted from the

experiment by analyzing the emission escape function. The enhanced escape probability for

emission along directions outside the stop gaps is explained by the angle-averaged internal-
reﬂection coeﬃcient ¯R(ω). The diﬀuse and angular-dependent nature of light escaping from

the photonic crystals proves that the light comes from emitters inside the crystals. By mea-

suring the escape functions of the quantum dot emission from the titania inverse opals, we

have for the ﬁrst time revealed clear stop gaps in the quantum dot emission spectra, conﬁrm-

ing that the conﬁned excitons experience optical conﬁnement. The quantitative agreement

between experiment and theory demonstrates that light propagation and spontaneous emis-

sion in real 3D photonic crystals is well understood.

VII. APPENDIX: MODEL OF DETECTION EFFICIENCY OF EMISSION SET-

The aim of this appendix is to explain the diﬀerence between the calculated escape

distribution and the measured intensity illustrated in Fig. 4. This diﬀerence appears because

the width of the projection of the collection optics (the spectrometer slit) on the sample

increases with the angle θe. The sample surface is placed in the focus of the collecting

lens L1, the spectrometer slit is in the focus of the imaging lens L2 (cf. Fig. 1). The only

emission collected emanates from the region conﬁned by the slit projection on the sample

surface, see Fig. 10. This means that the spectrometer collects light from a larger region

on the surface at larger detection angles, and that the measured angle-dependent intensity

should be corrected for the detection eﬃciency of the set-up. The detection eﬃciency is

modelled as a ratio D(µe) of the intensity B(µe) collected from the surface region within
the slit projection (Fig. 10) at detection angle θe = cos−1(µe) to the intensity B(µe = 1)

collected at normal angle:

D(µe) =

, B(µe) =

I(x, y)dxdy.

We take into account that the integration runs over a quarter of the slit, as x(µe) = x0/µe

is the half-width of the slit projection, x0 and y0 are the half-width and the half-height of

the slit projection at µe = cos(θe) = 1, respectively. Typical values of x0 and y0 in the

experiments are 50 µm and 1 mm. It is assumed that the intensity of diﬀuse light on the

sample surface around the pump beam varies as I(r) ∝ l2/(l2 + r2), where r2 = x2 + y2 is

the distance from the axis of the pump beam along the sample surface, and l is the mean

free path of light in the sample.

scattered pump light from entering the prism spectrometer. The angle θe is varied by rotating

the rotation stage, which carries the sample holder, the ﬁber, and the objective O1, whereas the

incident angle θp is kept ﬁxed.

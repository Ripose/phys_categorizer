Abstract

This is a short review of superstring theories, highlighting the impor-

tant concepts, developments and open problems of the subject.

Introduction

String theory postulates that all elementary particles in nature correspond
to diﬀerent vibration states of an underlying relativistic string.
In the
quantum theory both the frequencies and the amplitudes of vibration are
quantized, so that the quantum states of a string are discrete. They can
be characterized by their mass, spin and various gauge charges. One
of these states has zero mass and spin equal to 2~, and can be identiﬁed
with the messenger of gravitational interactions, the graviton. Thus string
theory is a candidate for a uniﬁed theory of all fundamental interactions,
including quantum gravity.

In this short review article we discuss the theory of superstrings as con-
sistent theories of quantum gravity. The aim is to provide a quick (mostly
lexicographic and bibliographic) entry to some of the salient features of
the subject for a non-specialist audience. Our treatment is thus neither
complete nor comprehensive – there exist for this several excellent expert
books, in particular by Green, Schwarz and Witten [1] and by Polchinski
[2]. An introductory textbook by Zwiebach [3] is also highly recommended
for beginners. Several other complementary reviews on various aspects of
superstring theories are available on the internet [4] ; some more will be
given as we proceed.

2 The ﬁve superstring theories

Theories of relativistic extended objects are tightly constrained by anoma-
lies, i.e. quantum violations of classical symmetries. These arise because

the classical trajectory of an extended p-dimensional object (or “p-brane”)
is described by the embedding X µ(ζ a), where ζ a=0,···p parametrize the
brane worldvolume, and X µ=0,···D−1 are coordinates of the target space.
The quantum mechanics of a single p-brane is therefore a (p+1)-dimensional
quantum ﬁeld theory, and as such suﬀers a priori from ultraviolet diver-
gences and anomalies. The case p = 1 is special in that these problems
can be exactly handled. The story for higher values of p is much more
complicated, as will become apparent later on.

The theory of ordinary loops in space is called closed bosonic string
theory. The classical trajectory of a bosonic string extremizes the Nambu-
Goto action (proportional to the invariant area of the worldsheet)

where Gµν (X) is the target-space metric, and α′ is the Regge slope (which
is inversely proportional to the string tension and has dimensions of length
squared).
In ﬂat spacetime, and for a conformal choice of worldsheet
parameters ζ ± = ζ 0

ζ 1, the equations of motion read:

∂+∂−X µ = 0 and ηµν ∂±X µ∂±X ν = 0 .,

with ηµν the Minkowski metric. The X µ are thus free two-dimensional
ﬁelds, subject to quadratic phase-space constraints known as the Vira-
soro conditions. These can be solved consistently at the quantum level
in the critical dimension D = 26. Otherwise the symmetries of eqs. (2)
are anomalous: either Lorentz invariance is broken, or there is a conformal
anomaly leading to unitarity problems.1

Even for D = 26, bosonic string theory is, however, sick because its
it has negative mass squared. This

lowest-lying state is a tachyon, i.e.
follows from the zeroth-order Virasoro constraints,

where NL(NR) is the sum of the frequencies of all left(right)-moving exci-
tations on the string worldsheet. The negative contribution to m2 comes
from quantum ﬂuctuations, and is analogous to the well-known Casimir
energy. The tachyon has NL = NR = 0. Its presence signals an instability
of Minkowski spacetime, which in bosonic string theory is expected to
decay, possibly to some lower-dimensional highly-curved geometry. The
details of how this happens are not, at present, well understood.

The problem of the tachyon is circumvented by endowing the string
with additional, anticommuting coordinates, and requiring space-time su-
persymmetry [5]. This is a symmetry that relates string states with
integer spin, obeying Bose-Einstein statistics, to states with half-integer
spin obeying Fermi-Dirac statistics. There exist two standard descriptions
of the superstring: the Ramond-Neveu-Schwarz (RNS) formulation,
where the anticommuting coordinates ψµ carry a space-time vector index,
and the Green-Schwarz (GS) formulation in which they transform as a

space-time spinor θα. Each has its advantages and drawbacks: the RNS
formulation is simpler from the worldsheet point of view, but awkward
for describing space-time fermionic states; in the GS formulation, on the
other hand, space-time supersymmetry is manifest but quantization can
only be carried out in the restrictive light-cone gauge. A third formulation,
possibly combining the advantages of the other two, has been proposed
more recently by Berkovits [6] – it is at this stage still being developed.

Anomaly cancellation leads to ﬁve consistent superstring theories, all
deﬁned in D = 10 ﬂat space-time dimensions. They are referred to as type
E8, and type I. The two
IIA, type IIB, heterotic SO(32), heterotic E8
type II theories are given (in the RNS formulation) by a straightforward
extension of eqs. (2) :

± = 0 and ηµν ψµ

±∂±X ν = 0 .

The left- and right-moving worldsheet fermions can be separately periodic
or antiperiodic – these are known as Ramond (R) and Neveu-Schwarz (NS)
boundary conditions. Ramond fermions have zero modes obeying a Dirac
γ-matrix algebra, and which must thus be represented on spinor space.
+ and ψµ
As a result out of the four possible boundary conditions for ψµ
−,
namely NS-NS, R-R, NS-R or R-NS, the ﬁrst two give rise to string states
that are space-time bosons, while the other two give rise to states that
are space-time fermions. Consistency of the theory further requires that
one only keep states of deﬁnite worldsheet fermion parities – an operation
known as the GSO (for Gliozzi-Scherk-Olive) projection. This operation
removes the would-be tachyon, and acts as a chirality projection on the
spinors. The IIA and IIB theories diﬀer only in the relative chiralities of
spinors coming from the left and right Ramond sectors.

The fact that string excitations split naturally into non-interacting left
and right movers is crucial for the construction of the heterotic strings.
The key idea is to put together the left-moving sector of the D = 10
type II superstring and the right-moving sector of the D = 26 bosonic
string. A subtlety arises because the left-right asymmetry may lead to
extra anomalies, under global reparametrizations of the string worldsheet.
These are known as modular anomalies, and we will come back to them
in the following section. Their cancellation imposes stringent constraints
on the zero modes of the unmatched (chiral) bosons in the right-moving
sector. The free-ﬁeld expansion of these bosons can be written as :

where bold-face letters denote sixteen-component vectors. Modular in-
variance then requires that the generalized momentum pR take its values
in a sixteen-dimensional, even self-dual lattice. There exist two such lat-
tices, and they are generated by the roots of the Lie groups Spin(32)/Z2
E8. They give rise to the two consistent heterotic string theories.
and E8
In contrast to the type II and heterotic theories, which are based on
oriented closed strings, the type I theory has unoriented closed strings
as well as open strings in its perturbative spectrum. The closed strings
are the same as in type IIB, except that one only keeps those states

must also be invariant under this ﬂip, and can furthermore carry point-
like (Chan-Paton) charges at their two endpoints. This is analogous to
the ﬂavor carried by quarks at the endpoints of the chromoelectric ﬂux
tubes in QCD. Ultraviolet ﬁniteness requires that the Chan-Paton charges
span a 32-dimensional vector space, so that open strings transform in bi-
fundamental symmetric or antisymmetric representations of SO(32). For
a thorough review of type I string theory see reference [7].

Interactions and eﬀective theories

Strings interact by splitting or by joining at a point, as is illustrated in
ﬁgure 1. This is a local interaction that respects the causality of the theory.
To compute scattering amplitudes one sums over all worldsheets with a
given set of asymptotic states, and weighs each local interaction with a
factor of the string coupling constant λ. The expansion in powers of
λ is analogous to the Feynman-diagram expansion of point-particle ﬁeld
theories. These latter are usually deﬁned by a Lagrangian, or more exactly
by a functional-integral measure, and they make sense both for oﬀ-shell
quantities as well as at the non-perturbative level. In contrast, our current
formulation of superstring theory is in terms of a perturbatively-deﬁned
S-matrix. The advent of dualities has oﬀered glimpses of an underlying
non-perturbative structure called M-theory, but deﬁning it precisely is
one of the major outstanding problems in the subject.2

Another important expansion of string theory, very useful when it
comes to extracting space-time properties, is in terms of the characteris-
tic string length l s = √α′. At energy scales Els
1 only a handful of
massless string states propagate, and their interactions are governed by
an eﬀective low-energy Lagrangian. In the type-II theories the massless
bosonic states (or rather their corresponding ﬁelds) consist of the metric
Gµν , a scalar ﬁeld Φ called the dilaton, and a collection of antisymmet-
ric n-form ﬁelds coming from both the NS-NS and the R-R sectors. For
type IIA these latter are a NS-NS 2-form B2, a R-R 1-form C1, and a R-R

The action (6), together with its fermionic part, deﬁnes the maximally-
supersymmetric non-chiral extension of Einstein’s gravity in ten dimen-
sions called type-IIA supergravity [9]. The dilaton and all antisymmetric
tensor ﬁelds belong to the supermultiplet of the graviton – they provide to-
gether the same number of (bosonic) states as a ten-dimensional non-chiral
gravitino. Supersymmetry ﬁxes furthermore completely all two-derivative
terms of the action, so that the theory deﬁned by (6) is (almost) unique.3
It is, therefore, not surprising that it should emerge as the low-energy limit
of the (non-chiral) superstring theory. This latter provides, however, an
ultraviolet completion of an otherwise non-renormalizable theory, a com-
pletion which is, at least perturbatively, ﬁnite and consistent.

The ﬁniteness of string perturbation theory has been, strictly-speaking,

only established up to two loops – for a recent review see [10]. However,
even though the technical problem is open and hard, the qualitative case
for all-order ﬁniteness is convincing. It can be illustrated with the torus
diagram which makes a one-loop contribution to string amplitudes. The
thin torus of ﬁgure 2 could be traced either by a short, light string propa-
gating (virtually) for a long time, or by a long, heavy string propagating
for a short period of time. In conventional ﬁeld theory these two virtual
trajectories would have made distinct contributions to the amplitude, one

in the infrared and the second in the ultraviolet region. In string theory,
on the other hand, they are related by a modular transformation (that
exchanges ζ 0 with ζ 1) and must not, therefore, be counted twice. A simi-
lar kind of argument shows that all potential divergences of string theory
are infrared – they are therefore kinematical (i.e. occur for special values
of the external momenta), or else they signal an instability of the vacuum
and should cancel if one expands around a stable ground state.

The low-energy limit of the heterotic and type I string theories is N=1
supergravity plus super Yang-Mills.
In addition to the N=1 graviton
multiplet, the massless spectrum now also includes gauge bosons and their
associated gauginos. The two-derivative eﬀective action in the heterotic
case reads :

Supersymmetry ﬁxes again completely the above action – the only freedom
is in the choice of the gauge group and of the Yang-Mills coupling gYM.
Thus, up to redeﬁnitions of the ﬁelds, the type I theory has necessarily
the same low-energy limit.

The D=10 supergravity plus super Yang-Mills has a hexagon diagram
that gives rise to gauge and gravitational anomalies, similar to the trian-
gle anomaly in D=4. It turns out that for the two special groups E8
E8
and SO(32), the structure of these anomalies is such that they can be can-
celled by a combination of local counterterms. One of them is of the form
X8(F, R), where X8 is an 8-form quartic in the curvature and/or
Yang-Mills ﬁeld strength. The other is already present in the lower line of
R
expression (7), with the replacement ωgauge
, where the
second Chern-Simons form is built out of the spin connection. Note that
these modiﬁcations of the eﬀective action involve terms with more than
two derivatives, and are not required by supersymmetry at the classical
level. The discovery by Green and Schwarz that string theory produces
precisely these terms (from integrating out the massive string modes) was
called the “ﬁrst superstring revolution.”

4 D-branes

A large window into the non-perturbative structure of string theory has
been opened by the discovery of D(irichlet)-branes, and of strong/weak-
coupling duality symmetries. A Dp-brane is a solitonic p-dimensional
excitation, deﬁned indirectly by the property that its worldvolume can
attach open-string endpoints (see ﬁgure 3). Stable Dp-branes exist in the
type-IIA and type-IIB theories for p even, respectively odd, and in the
type I theory for p = 1 and 5. They are charged under the R-R (p + 1)-
form potential or, for p > 4, under its magnetic dual. Strictly-speaking,

of the worldvolume gauge ﬁeld, and in the CS term one is instructed to
keep the (p + 1)-form of the expression under the integration sign. The
constants Tp and ρp are the tension and charge-density of the D-brane.
As was the case for the eﬀective supergravities, the above action receives
curvature corrections that are higher order in the α′ expansion. Note
however that a class of higher-order terms have been already resummed
in expression (8). These involve arbitrary powers of Fab, and are closely
related (more precisely ‘T-dual’, see later) to relativistic eﬀects which
can be important even in the weak-acceleration limit. When refering to
the D9-branes of the type I superstring, the action (8) includes the Green-
Schwarz terms required to cancel the gauge anomaly.

its coupling to the (closed-string) graviton and R-R (p + 1)-form, with the
result :

κ2 (4π2α′)3−p .

(9)

The equality of tension and charge follows from unbroken supersymmetry,
and is also known as a Bogomol’nyi-Prasad-Sommerﬁeld (BPS) condi-
tion. It implies that two or more identical D-branes exert no net static
force on each other, because their R-R repulsion cancels exactly their
gravitational attraction. A non-trivial check of the result (9) comes from
the Dirac quantization condition (generalized to extended objects by
Nepomechie and Teitelboim). Indeed, a Dp-brane and a D(6
p)-brane
are dual excitations, like electric and magnetic charges in four dimensions,
so their couplings must obey

(10)

This ensures that the Dirac singularity of the long-range R-R ﬁelds of
the branes does not lead to an observable Bohm-Aharonov phase. The
couplings (9) obey this condition with k = 1, so that D-branes carry the
smallest allowed R-R charges in the theory.

· · ·

A simple but important observation is that open strings living on a
collection of n identical D-branes have matrix-valued wavefunctions ψij ,
where i, j = 1,
, n label the possible endpoints of the string. The low-
energy dynamics of the branes is thus described by a non-abelian gauge
theory, with group U (n) if the open strings are oriented, and SO(n) or
Sp(n) if they are not. We have already encountered such Chan-Paton
factors in our discussion of the type I superstring. More generally, this
simple property of D-branes has lead to many insights on the geometric
interpretation and engineering of gauge theories, which are reviewed in
the present volume in references [11]. It has also placed on a ﬁrmer footing
the idea of a brane world, according to which the ﬁelds and interactions
of the Standard Model would be conﬁned to a set of D-branes, while
gravitons are free to propagate in the bulk (for reviews see references
[12][13]).
It has, ﬁnally, inspired the gauge/string-theory or AdS/CFT
correspondence [14][15] on which we will comment later on.

5 Dualities and M theory

One other key role of D-branes has been to provide evidence for the
various non-perturbative duality conjectures. Dual descriptions of the
same physics arise also in conventional ﬁeld theory. A prime example is
the Montonen-Olive duality of four-dimensional, N=4 supersymmetric
Yang-Mills, which is the low-energy theory describing the dynamics of a
collection of D3-branes. The action for the gauge ﬁeld and six associated
scalars ΦI (all in the adjoint representation of the gauge group G) is

Consider for simplicity the case G = SU (2). The scalar potential has ﬂat
directions along which the six ΦI commute. By a SO(6) R-symmetry ro-
tation we can set all but one of them to zero, and let < Tr(Φ1Φ1) >= v2
in the vacuum. In this ‘Coulomb phase’ of the theory a U (1) gauge multi-
plet stays massless, while the charged states become massive by the Higgs
eﬀect. The theory admits furthermore smooth magnetic-monopole and
dyon solutions, and there is an elegant formula for their mass :

The extension of these ideas to string theory can be illustrated with
the strong/weak- coupling duality between the type I theory, and the
Spin(32)/Z2 heterotic string. Both have the same massless spectrum and
low-energy action, whose form is dictated entirely by supersymmetry. The
only diﬀerence lies in the relations between the string and supergravity
parameters. Eliminating the latter one ﬁnds :

and α′

≫

It is, thus, very tempting to conjecture that the strongly-coupled type I
theory has a dual description as a weakly-coupled heterotic string. These
are, indeed, the only known ulraviolet completions of the theory (7). Fur-
thermore, for λI
1 the D1-brane of the type I theory becomes light,
and could be plausibly identiﬁed with the heterotic string. This conjec-
ture has been tested successfully by comparing various supersymmetry-
protected quantities (such as the tensions of BPS excitations and special
higher-derivative terms in the eﬀective action), which can be calculated
exactly either semiclassically, or at a given order in the perturbative ex-
pansion. Testing the duality for non-protected quantities is a hard and
important problem, which looks currently out of reach.

The other three string theories have also well-motivated dual descrip-
tions at strong coupling λ. The type IIB theory is believed to have a
SL(2, Z) symmetry, similar to that of the N=4 super Yang Mills.4 The
type IIA theory has a more surprising strong-coupling limit: it grows one
extra dimension (of radius R11 = 1/λ√α′), and can be approximated
at low energy by the maximal eleven-dimensional supergravity of
Cremmer, Julia and Scherk. This latter is a very economical theory – its

The electric and magnetic charges of the three-form are a (fundamen-

reduction on a circle [17] maps S11D to the IIA supergravity action (6),
where Gµν , φ and C1 descend from the eleven-dimensional graviton, and
B2 and C3 from the three-form A3. Furthermore, all BPS excitations of
the type IIA string theory have a counterpart in eleven dimensions, as
summarized in the table below. Finally, if one compactiﬁes the eleventh
dimension on an interval (rather than a circle), one ﬁnds the conjectured
strong-coupling limit of the E8

The web of duality relations can be extended by compactifying further
to D
9 dimensions. Readers interested in more details should consult
Polchinski’s book [2] or one of the many existing reviews of the subject
[18][4].
In nine dimensions, in particular, the two type II theories, as
well as the two heterotic superstrings, are pairwise T-dual. T-duality is
a perturbative symmetry (thus ﬁrmly established, not only conjectured)
which exchanges momentum and winding modes. Putting together all
the links one arrives at the fully-connected web of ﬁgure 4. This makes the
point that all ﬁve consistent superstrings, and also eleven-dimensional su-
pergravity, are limits of a unique underlying structure called M theory.5
A background-independent deﬁnition of M-theory has remained elusive.
Attempts to deﬁne it as a matrix model of D0-branes, or by quantizing
a fundamental membrane, proved interesting but incomplete. The diﬃ-
culty stems from the fact that in a generic background, or in D = 11
Minkowski spacetime, there is only a dimensionful parameter ﬁxing the
scale at which the theory becomes strongly-coupled.

6 Other developments and outlook

We have not discussed in this brief review some important developments
covered in other contributions to the encyclopedia. For the reader’s con-
venience, and for completeness, we enumerate (some of) them giving the
appropriate cross-references:

•

Compactiﬁcation. To make contact with the Standard Model of
particle physics, one has to compactify string theory on a six-dimensional
manifold. There is an embarassement of riches, but no completely realistic
vacuum and, more signiﬁcantly, no guiding dynamical principle to help
us decide – see [19]. The controlled (and phenomenologically required)
breaking of spacetime supersymmetry is also a problem.

•

Conformal ﬁeld theory and quantum geometry. The algebraic
tools of 2D conformal ﬁeld theory, both bulk and boundary – see [20],
play an important role in string theory. They allow, in certain cases,

5For lack of a better deﬁnition, ‘M’ is sometimes also used to denote the D=11 supergravity

plus supermembranes, as in ﬁgure 4.

geometric notions do not apply.

•

Microscopic models of black holes. Charged extremal black
holes can be modeled in string theory by BPS conﬁgurations of D-branes.
This has lead to the ﬁrst microscopic derivation of the Bekenstein-Hawking
entropy formula, a result expected from any consistent theory of quantum
gravity. As with the tests of duality, the extension of these results to
neutral black holes is a diﬃcult open problem – see [21].

•

AdS/CFT and holography. A new type of (holographic) duality
is the one that relates supersymmetric gauge theories in four dimensions
to string theory in asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes. The sharpest
and best tested version of this duality relates N=4 super Yang Mills to
string theory in AdS5
S5. Solving the σ-model in this latter background
is one of the keys to further progress in the subject – see [14].

×

•

String phenomenology. Finding an experimental conﬁrmation of
string theory is clearly one of the most pressing outstanding questions.
There exist several interesting possibilities for this – cosmic strings, large
extra dimensions, modiﬁcations of gravity, primordial cosmology – see the
review [22]. Here we point out the one supporting piece of experimental
evidence : the uniﬁcation of the gauge couplings of the (supersymmetric,
minimal) Standard Model at a scale close to, but below the Planck scale,
as illustrated in ﬁgure 5. This is a generic ‘prediction’ of string theory,
especially in its heterotic version.

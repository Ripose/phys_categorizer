Quantum mechanics from a universal action reservoir

A. Garrett Lisi∗

February 2, 2008

Abstract

A heuristic derivation of quantum mechanics using information theory requires a foun-
dational physical principle: the existence of a universal action reservoir, analogous to the
energy reservoir of a canonical ensemble.

1 Introduction

Modern information theory provides a practical framework for mathematically inferring probabil-
ities for possible occurrences based on what is known by an observer.[1] This Bayesian approach
– associating probabilities with likelihoods for a system rather than with frequencies of events
– works for simple systems and single particles as well as for aggregates of many. The methods
provide a new perspective on constructions in statistical mechanics and, along with one necessary
physical principle, lead directly to quantum mechanics.

2 Quantum Mechanics

An important clue towards establishing a good conceptual foundation for quantum mechanics is
that so much can be done without it. Even though the universe is fundamentally quantum, clas-
sical descriptions match most of our macroscopic experience. Also, on the technical level, most
descriptions of classical systems can be successfully quantized to obtain quantum descriptions.
This seems strange from the perspective of taking QM to be fundamental – it is as if quantum
mechanics is something extra, rather than something diﬀerent. Finally, the success of special
and general relativity imply QM should be formulated relativisticly, without a special role for
time. These facts, and its use in QFT, indicate Feynman’s path integral formulation[2] is the
best foundational description, summarized by the use of the quantum partition function,

The sum (a path integral) is over all paths (or histories) in classical conﬁguration space, and S
is the classical action associated with each path. The formal similarity to the partition function
for a statistical canonical ensemble is striking,

and the two follow from identical derivations. Since path integrals (as casually treated here)
may not always be mathematically sensible, the following derivation of quantum mechanics is
best viewed as a heuristic argument – primarily serving to uncover the physical principles and
interpretations underlying the theory.

Consider a system described by a set of conﬁguration variables, q. A path of the the system
(analogous to a canonical state) is a continuous function, path = q(t), parameterized by a set
C (possibly
of one or more parameters, t. For a physical system, an action, S[path] = S[q(t)]
complex), is associated with each path. Typically, the action is an integral of a system Lagrangian
over the parameters, S =
dt L(q, ˙q). Every observer naturally associates a probability, p[path] =
p[q(t)] (abbreviated p[q]), with each possible path of the system. The self-information is the
R
log p[path] – it is the amount of
negative logarithm of the probability for the path, log
information the observer would get by knowing the system is on path. The entropy (synonymous
with ignorance, Shannon uncertainty, and information entropy) of a probability distribution is

in which the path integral appears as a sum over system paths. This number represents the
observer’s overall ignorance of which path the system takes. The principle of maximum entropy
is the reasonable assertion that the ignorance of the probability distribution should be maximized,
constrained by what the observer knows. One such constraint is that all the probabilities should
sum to one,

consistent with the fact the system is known to exist. For the case of a statistical (thermody-
namic) canonical ensemble, a system is presumed to be in equilibrium with an energy reservoir of
known temperature, implying an average state energy. Analogously, quantum mechanics appears
to derive from a single physical principle:

A quantum system is one in contact with a universal action reservoir,
providing a known expected path action.

The resulting Lagrange multiplier value, α = 1

to the average path action, S, of the universal reservoir. Planck’s constant is analogous to the

universal nature – analogous to an isothermal canonical ensemble. If allowing α, S, and many
other numbers to be imaginary is unpalatable, an alternative is to Wick rotate to real quantities

the system is determined using the probability distribution and how it changes when system
parameters are varied. All the tools of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics are available.

The quantum wavefunction, Ψ(q′, t′), is the complex amplitude of paths with t < t′ meeting at q′,
while its complex conjugate, Ψ∗(q′, t′), is the amplitude of paths with t > t′ leaving from q′ – these
probability amplitudes multiply to give the probability of the system passing through q′(t′). (This
wavefunction description is subordinate to the probability distribution (2), and works only when
t′ is a physical parameter and the system is t′ symmetric, providing a real partition function, Z.)
If new information is discovered about the system, the probability distribution must be adjusted
accordingly by maximizing the entropy (1) within the bounds of the new knowledge constraints –
“wavefunction collapse.” Also, just as in thermodynamic systems, the quantum system is never
known with certainty to be on a single path. (The insistence that the system does follow one
path, and we just don’t know what it is, is the Bohmian interpretation.)

3 Discussion

The practical use of path integrals, partition functions, and Wick rotation is well established
in quantum ﬁeld theory. Nevertheless, the woolly nature of the path integral (as treated here)
implies the presented derivation qualiﬁes only as a heuristic sketch. Also, the physical inter-
pretation and justiﬁcation for Wick rotation and complex probability distributions remains an
open question. It is not yet clear (to the author) whether this path likelihood approach to quan-
tum mechanics can be made computationally sound and lead to new physical predictions, but
it seems worth investigating. The main product of the work is the proposal of a new physical
principle for the foundation and interpretation of quantum mechanics: a universal background
action. Additionally, an observer dependent probability distribution is compatible with the Rela-
tional Quantum Mechanics interpretation and the emergence of thermal time from a probability
distribution.[3, 4] This point of view gives wavefunction collapse the trivial interpretation of
likelihood adjustment based on knowledge acquisition. Finally, the relativistic nature of this
background action formulation gives some hope it may ﬁnd application in a viable theory of
quantum gravity.

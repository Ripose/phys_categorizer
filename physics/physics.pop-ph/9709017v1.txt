What was the fastest 100m ﬁnal?

Over the past 10 years, we’ve seen a number of exceptional sprint per-
formances at the world class level. Of particular note has been the recent
emergence of a handful of contenders to the title of “World’s Fastest Man”.
A decade previous, we would have been talking Ben Johnson and Carl Lewis.
Today, we ﬁnd it hard to choose between Donovan Bailey, Frank Freder-
icks, Ato Boldon, and Maurice Greene. Of course, we can’t forget (recently
stepped-down) European Sprint King Linford Christie, or former WR holder
Leroy Burrell. The increase in number of top world class sprinters makes
one wonder: what really was the fastest 100m ﬁnal?

Recently, I’ve written several articles which have discussed correcting
for wind eﬀects in the sprints [1, 2]: this provides an easy way to compare
most 100m times run in essentially any wind condition (head- or tail-wind).
Unfortunately the model doesn’t take temperature into account, but suscep-
tibility to temperature must almost certainly be an individual factor (proof:
I ﬁnd 15o weather pleasant and cool, while all other Californians don their
parkas). The ﬁndings have been most interesting, and have re-written the
record books to a certain degree.

In the following article, I will analyze the results from key races over the
past 10 years. These include the 1983-1997 World Championships (WC) ﬁ-
nals, 1984-1996 Olympic Games (OG) ﬁnals, and the 1996 Lausanne Grand
Prix (LGP) ﬁnal, in which Frank Fredericks ran his 9.86s PB into a 0.4 m/s
headwind. The latter race was considered by many to be the ﬁnest 100m
performance ever. In fact, after wind-correction, this adjusts to a calm 9.84s,
numerically matching Donovan Bailey’s 9.84 (+0.7 m/s). Meanwhile, Bai-
ley’s WR mark translates to a 9.88s, and is usurped by Fredericks’ Lausanne
run (Table 1).

Fastest average race times

First, let’s look at the average wind-corrected times for each ﬁnal (Ta-

1

ble 2). The only race with a sub-10s average time is the 1996 LGP. This
low value is weighted by the fact that 4 of the competitors clocked sub-10s
runs, and 4th-7th place were within 0.01s of each other. The WR race in
Atlanta is ranked 3rd in terms of average time, and surprisingly the 1991
WC ﬁnal (which featured the most legal sub-10s runs in a single race) ranks
only 4th. In fact, the average times of the 1996 OG and 1991 WC ﬁnals
are almost identical (after wind-correction). Near the bottom of the list are
the 1983 WC and 1984 OG, which featured few spectacular performances
(retroactively speaking). That is, with the exception of Carl Lewis, the times
were quite far oﬀ the WR of the time (Calvin Smith’s 9.93s from Colorado
Springs, 07 Jul 1983).

Note, however, that even though they were monumental races of their
day, the 1987 WC and 1988 OG runs are ranked last! This is due to the fact
that the last place ﬁnishers in each race (Pierfrancesco Pavoni ITA - 16.38,
Ray Stewart JAM - 12.26) were obviously not running at peak potential.
This raises a serious concern when dealing with the overall average times of
races.

It seems logical that one can divide a race into two distinct groups: the
top 4 or 5 ﬁnishers are most likely the serious medal contenders, and can be
taken to represent the “quality” of the ﬁnal. Those who ﬁnish 5th-8th do so
for any number of reasons, which might include: (a) they don’t match the
calibre of the top ﬁnalists, and ﬁnish at the best of their ability, (b) they
pull up in the race or are running injured, or (c) they shut down before the
ﬁnish line because of mental duress (e.g. Merlene Ottey at the 1997 WC).

The average winning margin

Since the overall average time for a ﬁnal can apparently be misleading,
as per the conclusion of the previous section, it might make more sense
to consider the average winning margins of each race. That is, by how
much, on average, did the gold medallist defeat his competitors? Adhering
to the KISS principle (Keep It Statistically Simple, not developed by Gene
Simmons), there is a straightforward expression for calculating this beast:

Average winning
margin

=

Average time of
ﬁrst k competitors

− Winning
time

(cid:17) .

(1)

k
k − 1 (cid:16)

The winning margin can help up compare top ﬁnishing places in diﬀerent

2

races, and can provide more information besides just how far ahead of the
rest of the ﬁeld was the gold medalist.

While the results from each race are wind-corrected to provide an easy
ground for comparison, the quantity above is essentially independent of this
correction. In a typical world class race (where the ﬁrst and last place times
fall within about a 0.3s interval), wind-correction roughly amounts to a shift
of an overall constant (a couple hundredths of a second), and this overall
constant cancels out in the above equation (trust me!). So, the average
winning margin as calculated by this method will be the same regardless of
whether or not the times are wind-corrected or oﬃcial.

Tables 3,5 rank the average ﬁnishing times for the top 3 and 4 competi-
tors, while Tables 4,6 order the winning margins in increasing order. This
gives a sense of the “closeness” of the race: the smaller the average winning
margin, the closer the ﬁnish, and the closer the calibre of the athletes in the
ﬁnal.

While the increase from 3 to 4 ﬁnishers rearranges the lists, there are
several key constants of note. In each case (Tables 3,5), the fastest average
race is the 1996 Lausanne Grand Prix, the wind-corrected World Record
race which produced Fredericks’ headwind 9.86 dash. The Atlanta ﬁnal
(1996 OG) takes 2nd and 3rd place in the averages rankings, trailing the 96
LGP average ﬁnishes by roughly 0.02s. It posts the 2nd smallest winning
margin for top 3, but slips to to 4th for the top 4 ﬁnalists.

The 1991 WC ﬁnal holds its ranking as the “closest” race, yielding a win-
ning margin of 0.035s and 0.044s for top 3 and 4 placings. As noted earlier,
this race posted the most sub-10s marks ever, but after a wind-correction
treatment, the average top 3 and 4 times rank only 5th and 4th, respec-
tively. This is a good example of how a race can seem faster than it really is
because of tailwind eﬀects, but even after correction can still be considered
quite an impressive sprint!

Conversely, the races with the lowest average for top 3 and 4 are the 1984
OG and 1983 and 1987 WCs. Likewise, these represent the largest average
winning margins. This information is quite useful: in each race, Carl Lewis
was the clear winner. Apparently he was quite ahead of his time! Interest-
ingly enough, Lewis is also a factor in the 1991 WC race, posting his legal

3

(and new WR) 9.86s jolt.

The 1987 WC and 1988 OG

As we all know too well, the 1987 WC and 1988 OG ﬁnals were par-
ticularly out of the ordinary. Ben Johnson’s then-WR marks of 9.83s and
9.79s were themselves about 10 years ahead of their time, having been only
recently clocked by other world class contenders after wind-correction. The
9.83s mark (+1.0 m/s) corresponds to a 9.89s still-air run, which has been
matched or bettered by several athletes in recent years (Bailey, Greene at
9.88s, and Bailey, Christie, Burrell at 9.89s). Meanwhile, the 9.79s (+1.1)
adjusts to 9.85s, having only been topped by Fredericks’ infamous 1996 LGP
mark.

If we were to consider the results to be oﬃcial, how would the ﬁndings be
aﬀected? Table 7 shows the appropriate statistics for the races in question,
including Johnson’s stricken marks. Again, the overall averages are unusu-
ally high, due to the lackluster clockings of 8th place (10.948s and 10.346s).
Without last place, the overall averages lower to 10.193s and 10.059s, rank-
ing these after the 1997 WC and 1995 WC.

Despite the anomalous last place times, the winning margin considered
earlier is unaﬀected by these. For the Johnson races, we have the average
top 3 times of 10.007s and 9.970s, with similar respective winning margins of
0.176s and 0.180s. According to this, the Seoul ﬁnal would rank 6th for top
3 ﬁnishers, and would mark one of the largest winning margins for the races
considered. In terms of top 4 ﬁnishers, we have 10.055s and 9.985s, with
winning margins of 0.220s and 0.180s. Again, these constitute some of the
largest winning margins, and help to show that Ben Johnson’s performances
were well in advance of the rest of the world (if we ignore why they were at
such a level).

Winning margins and World Record progression

Another interesting way to judge the “calibre” of a 100m ﬁnal is obvi-
ously to compare it to the current WR performance. The long/triple jump
always have a WR mark at the side of the pits, so the spectators can get
an idea of how close/far the competitor was from the crown. Why not have
one in the sprints?

4

This can roughly be done in a similar manner to the way that the win-
ning margin was calculated earlier. The question asked is: how far behind
the WR were the top k competitors in this race? Along with the winning
margins, Tables 3 and 5 list the deviation of the top 3 and 4 average times
from the WR (see also Table 8).

For the cases where the WR was set in the race, the winning margins
and the deviation from the WR are the same, since they’re calculated in ex-
actly the same manner. For the other cases, the method is slightly modiﬁed.
Instead of using the earlier expression involving the fraction k/(k − 1), we
just simply subtract the WR time from the average of the top 3 and 4.

Note a slight diﬀerence here.

In order to obtain this quantity with a
minimal amount of work, I have not wind-corrected these quantities. Had I
done this, I would have spent quite a while going back through the record
books to ﬁnd the wind-corrected WRs of each year, since we know that a
great performance can be masked by a suitably strong head-wind (e.g. Bai-
ley’s 10.03s in Abbotsford earlier this year [2]). So, to make the numbers
more “useful” to the naked eye, the wind conditions are not performed,
which can skew the data a bit when the wind conditions for the WR race
are suﬃciently diﬀerent for the race in question (case and point: the 1996
LGP winning margin v.s. the deviation from the 9.85 WR).

Musings

All this being said and done, how can we answer the question at hand?
Which race really is the fastest 100m? The easiest answer is that ther is no
deﬁnite answer. It all depends on what is meant by the fastest. Here are
some points to consider:

• The 1996 LGP produced the fastest wind-corrected time ever (9.84s),
and as a partial result yields the smallest average times (including
overall, top 3, and top 4 ﬁnishers)

• The 1991 WC race, while not seeming so fast after wind-correction,
was the closest race of all those considered, and could be understood
to have had the most on-equal-par athletes competing

5

• Carl Lewis’ performances in the 1980s were several years ahead of their

time, putting him far above the competition of the time

The results would tend to suggest that there are more exceptional World
Class athletes today who are of equal calibre than ever before. It’s interest-
ing to think what these lists might look like in another ten years!

Abstract

Recent results from the MINOS experiment at Fermilab reconﬁrm neu-
trino oscillations. We describe brieﬂy this experiment and discuss how this
and other experiments enable us to determine fundamental parameters of
elementary particle physics in the neutrino sector.

A press release dated March 30, 2006 from the US laboratory Fermilab re-
ported the ﬁrst results from a new neutrino experiment, MINOS (Main Injector
Neutrino Oscillation Search) [1]. The Main Injector accelerator at Fermilab
produces an intense beam of muon neutrinos and directs them at the MINOS
detector in the Soudan mine, at a depth of 716 meters, in Minnesota, 732 km
away. The MINOS experiment expected to observe 177±11 events but observed
only 92, which is 7.5σ away from 177. The probability that random ﬂuctations
are responsible for this shortfall is only part in 1010. Thus MINOS experiment
conﬁrmed that there is a shortfall in the number of muon neutrinos if they are
detected a long distance away from their point of production.

Two water Cerenkov detectors, Irvine-Michigan-Brookhaven (IMB) [2] and
Kamiokande [3] have ﬁrst observed this deﬁcit ﬁfteen years ago in muon neu-
trinos produced in the atmosphere. The interaction rate for downward going
neutrinos, which travel distances of the order of 100 km, was consistent with
expectation but the rate for upward going neutrinos, which travel thousands
of km, was only about 60% of the expectation. The ﬁeld of neutrino physics
received a tremendous boost in 1998, when the results of the very large wa-
ter Cerenkov detector, Super-Kamiokande were announced [4]. These results
not only conﬁrmed the deﬁcit of atmospheric muon neutrinos when they travel
long distances, but also showed that there are deﬁnite correlations between the
amount of deﬁcit and the distance travelled and also between the amount of
deﬁcit and the neutrino energy. Both the deﬁcit and the correlations can be
explained by assuming that muon neutrinos, during their long travel, oscillate
into another type of neutrino.

However, there are still large uncertainties in the calculation of atmospheric
neutrino ﬂuxes. The long baseline neutrino experiments were planned to ﬁnd
evidence for the spectral distortion caused by oscillations by locating the min-
imum of the muon neutrino survival probability. The location of this mini-
mum can be used to determine the neutrino oscillation parameters accurately.
In Super-Kamiokande, the observed neutrinos have varying energies and also
varying pathlengths. Locating the minimum of the survival probability is very
diﬃcult to do in Super-Kamiokande because the data sample spans large ranges
in energis and pathlengths. The ﬁrst long baseline neutrino experiment, called
K2K (KEK to Super-Kamiokande 230 km away) in Japan, was a low statis-
tics experiment which conﬁrmed the muon neutrino deﬁcit. It also observed a
distortion in the energy spectrum of the muon events, that is consistent with
oscillation hypothesis. The number of events in recent MINOS results also is
not very large and the current accuracy of MINOS is only slightly better than
that of K2K. But it is expected that with about 5 years of data taking, they will
increase their number of events twenty fold. This will enable them to observe
the minimum of the survival probability and determine the neutrino oscillation
parameters precisely.

If the MINOS results are interpreted in terms of three ﬂavour neutrino os-
cillations, they give the following values for neutrino oscillation parameters:

−0.15 ± 0.06. It can
∆m2
be seen from the results presented in [1, 5] that the MINOS results have already
improved the precision in the determination of ∆m2
23 but the precision in θ23 is
still controlled by atmospheric neutrino data.

Here we desribe the MINOS experiment with a little more detail. 120 GeV
protons are extracted from Fermilab’s Tevatron Main injector at the rate of
1013 protons per second and these protons are directed to a ﬁxed graphite
target. Pions and Kaons are selected from the resultant spray of secondary
particles and are focused into a 675 m evacuated decay pipe where they decay
into muons and muon neutrinos. Muons are absorbed by 200 m rock, leaving
behind a pure beam of muon neutrinos. The near detector (aprox 1 kton) is
located 300 m down from the hardron absorber. The far detector is placed in
Soudan and is a 5400 ton detector.
It was started on March 4, 2005 and it
aims to study neutrinos in the energy range 1-30 GeV and to provide a more
precise measurement of the mass diﬀerence and mixing angle responsible for
the disappearance of atmospheric neutrinos (∆m2
23 and θ23 mentioned above).
The experiment also studies νµ → νe oscillations in the same exposure. The
magnetized steel plates used in detectors allow us to distinguish νµ CC events
from ¯νµ CC events, and thus to search for CPT violation in atmospheric neutrino
oscillations.

We also brieﬂy recall the results from K2K. K2K which is a long-baseline
experiment where the neutrinos are produced in KEK using a proton synchro-
ton which accelerates protons to an energy of 12 GeV. These protons strike an
aluminum target and produces pions which then decay into muons and neu-
trinos. A detector in KEK ﬁrst detects the neutrino ﬂux before the neutrinos
travel 250 kms to SuperKamiokande, where they are detected by the Cerenkov

2

principle in 50,000 tons of water. In the absence of neutrino oscillations, there
were supposed to be 158.1+9.2

−8.6 events, but only 112 were observed [6].

Neutrinos are elementary particles, which are neutral counterparts of the
charged leptons, namely the electron, the muon and the τ -lepton all of which
participate in the weak interactions. The determination of neutrino properties
remains notoriously diﬃcult from the point of view of experiments and their pre-
cise determination remains one of the great challenges and goals of elementary
particle physics research today. At the moment, there is no information of even
the values of their individual masses, which are today bounded by experiments
as follows [7]: m1 < 3eV, m2 < 190keV, m3 < 18.2MeV. It is worth noting
here that the direct detection of the ντ was reported for the ﬁrst time only as
recently as 2000 [8] by the Fermilab DONUT (Direct Observation of Nu Tau,
E872) experiment. This experiment used protons accelerated by the Tevatron
to produce a ντ beam and an active emulsion detector.

We note here that the subject of neutrino physics is considered so impor-
tant at the present time that the American Physical Society has commissioned
a multi-divisional study whose reports are now available to the public on the
internet [9]. In particular, several working groups were formed, on solar and
atmospheric experiments, reactor experiments, neutrino factory and beta beam
experiments, neutrinoless double beta decay and direct search experiments, neu-
trino astrophysics and cosmology and on theory.

The presence of neutrino oscillations implies existence of distinct and non-
vanishing masses for the two heavier ﬂavours. In particular, there are now three
masses m1, m2 and m3 and three angles that ’mix’ the neutrino ﬂavours denoted
2. In addition, neutrinos may also be Majorana particles,
by θ12, θ23 and θ13
that is they are neutral fermions which are their own antiparticles. In that case
there would be also the possibility of lepton number violation in nature by two
units, ∆L = 2, which, e.g., is the basis of the neutrinoless double-beta decay
experiment. The matrix that describes the neutrino mixing called the PMNS
matrix, named for Pontecorvo, Maki, Nakagawa and Sakata after the authors
would ﬁrst described it. In form, it is very similar to its counterpart in the quark
sector, namely the CKM matrix named for Cabibbo, Kobayashi and Maskawa
[11]. However, the angles in the CKM matrix are all well measured and all
three of them are small (less than 12◦) whereas two of the three mixing angles
in neutrino sector are larger than 30◦, showing that the patterns of mixing
in quark and lepton sectors are very diﬀerent. Note that the CKM matrix
has a non-zero phase δ which leads to CP violation in the decays of K and
B mesons and is well determined from the experimental measurement of CP
violating observables. CP violation may also occur in neutrino oscillations if
PMNS matrix contains a non-zero phase. Such a non-zero phase is possible
in the mixing of three neutrinos (as it is in the case of three quarks). Such a
phase leads to the prediction that the oscillation probabilities for neutrinos and
anti-neutrinos are unequal. One can establish CP violation in neutrino sector
2This parameter has not been experimentally determined so far. A reactor neutrino ex-
periment, CHOOZ, which measured the survival probability of electron anti-neutrinos from a
nuclear power reactor in France, observed no deﬁcit and set the bound sin2 θ13 < 0.05 [10]

by studying να → νβ and ¯να → ¯νβ, where α and β are neutrino ﬂavours. CPT
violation in neutrino sector can be established if one can show that the survival
probabilities P (να → να) and P (¯να → ¯να) are unequal.

We now turn to the solar neutrino problem which has been discussed in
earlier [12]. This problem also is resolved by postulating neutrino oscillations.
To recall brieﬂy the salient features of this problem, the measured ﬂuxes of so-
lar neutrinos at the radio chemical experiments at Homestake (associated with
Raymond Davis Jr.), SAGE, Gallex and GNO experiments were signiﬁcantly
lower than those predicted by the standard solar model (SSM, associated with
John N. Bahcall). The experiment at Homestake was based on capture of neu-
trinos by chlorine nuclei, while those at the other three were based on capture of
neutrinos by gallium nuclei. That there was a solar neutrino problem was also
conﬁrmed by Kamiokande and SuperKamiokande experiments, which detected
solar neutrinos in real time by observing neutrino-electron scattering. Accord-
ing to standard electroweak model (SEM), the sun should emit only electron
neutrinos which can be detected on earth through their charged current (CC)
interactions.
In such an interaction, the electron neutrino exchanges charge
with another particle and produces an electron. The observed deﬁcit of solar
neutrinos, compared to the predictions of SSM is explained by assuming that
electron neutrinos are oscillating into muon/tau neutrinos. These neutrinos can-
not be observed in the above detectors because their CC interactions produce
a muon/tau in their ﬁnal states. The low energies of solar neutrinos preclude
the production of these heavy mass particles. Thus observed ﬂuxes were lower
than the predicted ﬂuxes.

This raises the question: Is it at all possible to observe the muon/tau neu-
trino fraction in the solar neutrinos reaching the earth? It is possible to observe
them through their neutral current (NC) interactions. In a NC interaction, a
neutrino of a given ﬂavour retains its identity and exchanges only energy with
the other participating particle. If heavy water is used as a target, then a neu-
trino interacting with a deuteron will break it up and the resultant neutron
can be detected. Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) used this technique to
measure the NC interaction rates of solar neutrinos. According to SEM, the
NC interaction rates of all three types of neutrinos, with any given particle,
are the same. Thus, if the electron neutrinos emitted by the sun are changing
into muon/tau neutrinos then the NC interaction rate should be consistent with
the predictions of SSM. The ﬁrst results of SNO, announced in 2001 [13], def-
initely established that the NC interaction rates of solar neutrinos are indeed
in accordance with SSM predictions. SNO independenly measured the CC in-
teraction rate of electron neutrinos also, by detecting the ﬁnal state electrons.
These measurements are consistent with the previous measurements and show
that there is indeed a shortfall of electron neutrinos from the sun as they arrive
on earth. Detection of the neutron in SNO is subject to various uncertainties.
Therefore SNO decided to use three diﬀerent techniques to detect the neutron.
In the ﬁrst phase, they used the heavy water itself to detect the neutron. In
the recently concluded second phase, salt was added to the heavy water to im-
prove the neutron detection eﬃciency [14]. In the current third phase, the salt is

withdrawn and 3He proportional counters added which detect neutrons through
the reaction n +3 He → p +3 H. This will assist in reducing the error in the
measurement of the NC reactions rates.

The combined results of the all solar neutrino experiments require that
the resolution of the solar neutrino problem is through neutrino oscillations
with a large mixing angle (LMA) modiﬁed by the MSW (Mikheyev-Smirnov-
Wolfenstein) mechanism. Recalling brieﬂy here, the MSW eﬀect results from
the enhancement of the ﬂavour oscillation of νe generated in various nuclear
reactions in the solar interior to νµ/ντ , due to their interaction with the dense
solar interior. The mechanism turns out to be eﬃcient for the energy range of
the detected neutrinos and is known as ’resonance conversion’. The ﬁnal deter-

mination of solar neutrino oscillation parameters are: ∆m2
−2.2)◦. It may be noted that results coming from the BOREXINO
θ12 = (33.9+2.4
experiment, which seeks to measure the intensity of the monochromatic 861
keV neutrino line could play an important role in constraining solar models and
neutrino oscillation models. An ambitious project based on the 1976 proposal
of R. S. Raghavan that is being planned is the LENS (Low Energy Neutrino
Spectroscopy) experiment, which is based on a radiochemical reaction involving
Indium targets and can also measure low-energy neutrinos produced in the solar
proton-proton cycle in real time.

12 = 8+0.6

In order to establish the validity of the conclusions from the SNO observa-
tions, viz., the resolution of the solar neutrino problem through the LMA-MSW
solution, the KamLAND experiment (Kamioka Liquid scintillator Anti-Neutrino
Detector) was set up in Toyama, Japan in 2002. The detector is surrounded by
53 Japanese commercial power reactors ( 180 kms away), which produce ¯νe. The
neutrinos are detected using the Cerenkov principle in 1000 tons of mineral oil,
benzene and ﬂuorescent chemicals. Without neutrino oscillation the experiment
expected to see 86.6 ± 5.6 events. However only 54 events were observed. This
conﬁrmed the picture of LMA oscillations in vacuum [15].

Finally, the presence of non-vanishing masses for the neutrinos is likely to
hold the key to our understanding of not just the properties of elementary par-
ticles, but also to the entire history of the Universe. As a result, it is important
to demonstrate neutrino oscillations in several diﬀerent settings, and to inde-
pendently measure mass square diﬀerences. That is why the results of MINOS
and the future experiments T2K (under construction) and NOVA and INO (in
planning stages) are important. Note that the above experiments, which detect
neutrino oscillations, can only give information on neutrino mass diﬀerences but
not on the mass of the lightest neutrino. This information is expected to come
from tritium beta decay experiments [16] and double-beta decay experiments
[17].

We recall here the results from a somewhat controversial experiment known
as LSND (Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector) [18]. The experiment observed
excesses of events for both the ¯νµ → ¯νe and νµ → νe oscillation searches. If
conﬁrmed, the results of LSND experiment imply that there is a mass-squared
diﬀerence of about 0.1 eV2 between two neutrino mass eigenstates. This con-

5

clusion, inevitably leads to the prediction that there should be a fourth light
neutrino, because we can’t have three mass-squared diﬀerences of three diﬀer-
ent orders of magnitude with just three neutrinos. The fourth neutrino must be
sterile (essentially non-interacting) because the results of the LEP experiments
have shown that there are only three light neutrinos with the standard interac-
tions [19]. MiniBooNE (Mini Booster Neutrino Experiment) [20] experiment at
Fermilab has been taking data and it can conﬁrm or rule out the LSND result.
It consists of a 1 GeV neutrino beam from pion decay and a single, 800-ton
mineral oil (12-meter diameter sphere) detector. The MiniBooNE detector is
located 500 meters downstream of the neutrino source. The MiniBooNE results
are expected to be announced in a year’s time.

In the following section we discuss experiments whose goal is neutrino as-
tronomy, identifying astrophysical sources of neutrinos which include medium
energy (about 100MeV) sources within our galaxy like supernovae and the sun
and high energy (a few GeV and greater) extragalactic sources like exploding
stars, gamma ray bursts, black holes and neutron stars. Some of these experi-
ments also try to detect neutrino oscillations.

It may be recalled that the ﬁeld of supernovae neutrino physics was born
with the detection of the neutrinos from the supernova 1987A by IMB [21] and
Kamiokande-II [22]. Some of the current neutrino experiments, Superkamiokande
and SNO, are capable of observing supernova neutrinos. There are various plans
to improve the current experiments or design new experiments to enhance the
detection capabitilies of supernova neutrinos. Study of signals from supernova
neutrinos in various diﬀerent types of detectors is an important topic in neutrino
physics today [23, 24].

Neutrino telescopes can be located under water. DUMAND (Deep Under-
water Muon And Neutrino Detector) and Baikal were among the ﬁrst to explore
the unchartered waters. The former was located oﬀshore Hawaii in the Paciﬁc
Ocean, while the latter was located in Lake Baikal in Siberia. The next one is
NESTOR (Neutrino Extended Submarine Telescope With Oceonographic Re-
search) located oﬀshore Greece, in the Mediterranean Sea, which detects neutri-
nos in the TeV range. It determined the cosmic ray muon ﬂux as a function of the
zenith angle and the energy spectrum and composition of primary cosmic rays.
The future experiments include ANTARES (Astronomy with a Neutrino Tele-
scope and Abyss environmental RESearch) located oﬀshore France and NEMO
(NEutrino Mediterranean Observatory) oﬀshore Sicily. ANTARES is a step to-
wards a cubic kilometre telescope in the Mediterranean Sea. ANTARES and
NEMO are designed to detect high energy neutrinos in the TeV to PeV range.
The new generation of neutrino experiments also includes the Antarctic
Muon and Neutrino Detector Array (AMANDA) built to detect extra-solar
sources of neutrinos. The photomultiplier tube (PMT) array located between
1500 m and 2000 m of Antarctic ice detects neutrinos coming through the earth
from the northern sky using the Cerenkov principle. The depth of the array
eﬀectively blocks atmospheric neutrinos. Compared to underground detectors
like SuperKamiokande, AMANDA is capable of looking at higher energy neutri-
nos (¿50 GeV). AMANDA demonstrated the viability of a neutrino telescope in

6

ice and in 2005 was oﬃcially incorporated into its successor ICECUBE. It will
encompass a cubic kilometre of ice and will be completed in 2010-11. IceCube
will be able to explore the PeV (1015 eV) energy region. The detection of cosmic
neutrino beams would open the opportunity to study neutrino oscillations over
Megaparsec baselines.

We take this opportunity to mention that there is a proposal to build a
neutrino observatory in India.
It is called India-based Neutrino Observatory
(INO) and is likely to be built in Nilgiris. It is a 30 kiloton detector consisting

detect muons produced by atmospheric muon neutrinos and can determine its
charge, energy and direction accurately. This will enable the detector to measure
the atmospheric mass-squared diﬀerence very accurately (to about 10%) [25]. In
addition it can also determine the mass-hierarchy of neutrino mass eigenstates
if the CHOOZ mixing angle θ13 is large enough [26].

We conclude by remarking here on the constraints that the present day neu-
trino experiments and the future experiments will place on theoretical models
for neutrino masses and mixings. One of the spectacular possibilities is that
of ’grand uniﬁcation’ of the standard model interactions, viz. the strong and
electro-weak interactions. Such models are often based on larger ’gauge groups’
into which the gauge symmetries of the standard model would ﬁt into. Notable
among these is SO(10) uniﬁcation, which would naturally accomodate a right
handed neutrino, and would also admit both Dirac and Majorana masses for
neutrinos.
In this event, the well-known ’see-saw’ mechanism could generate
the observed spectrum of masses [27]. There are many models today which
predict and accomodate the observed masses and mixings. The forthcoming
experimental results will help us in discriminating among these models.

Update: After this article was written, in a press release dated August 7,
2006 from Fermilab [28], it has been reported that the MINOS collaboration
has analyzed data representing 37increase compared to the results presented
end of March 2006. In the absence of neutrino oscillations, they would have
expected to see 336 ± 14 muon neutrinos, but instead they record 215 muon
neutrino events, thereby conﬁrming their previous results, with the best ﬁt for

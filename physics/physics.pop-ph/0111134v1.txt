Photons, Clocks, Gravity and the Concept of Mass
L.B.Okuna ∗

aITEP, Moscow, 117218, Russia

Transparencies of the 18th Henry Primakoﬀ lecture at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA,
April 11, 2001 and of the Special lecture given at the 7th International Workshop on Topics in Astroparticle and
Underground Physics, TAUP 2001, Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, Italy, September 9, 2001; to be published
by Elsevier Nucl. Phys. B (Proceedings supplements).

Various aspects of the concept of mass in modern physics are discussed: 1. Mass in Special Relativity, 2. Atoms

in Static Gravity, 3. Photons in Static Gravity, 4. Misleading Terminology, 5. Unsolved Problems of mass.

1. MASS IN SPECIAL RELATIVITY

11. Photon: m = 0, E = p, v = 1, no rest

1. The term mass was introduced by New-
ton in Principia, 1687: “Deﬁnition I: The
quantity of matter is the measure of the
same, arising from its density and bulk con-
jointly”.

2. The principle of relativity was formulated
by Galileo in Dialogue, 1632 (Galileo’s
ship).

docta ignorata” (“On the scientiﬁc igno-
rance”), 1440.

13. Mass of a system is conserved.

14. Mass is not a measure of inertia.

O.Roemer, 1676.

5. A. Michelson and E. Morley, 1887:

This measure is derived from: dp/dt = F,
p = Ev.

c is the maximal velocity of signals. c = 1.

15. Mass is not additive at v

= 0.

son on the ship of Galileo.

m = m1 + m2 only at v1 = v2 = 0.

16. Mass is not a source and receptor of gravity

at v

= 0 (see item 20).

17. Mass is not a measure of an amount of mat-
ter. The concept of matter is much broader
in relativity than in classical physics (exam-
ples: gas or ﬂux of photons and/or neutri-
nos).

18. From mathematical point of view mass oc-
cupies a higher rank position in special rel-
ativity than in non-relativistic physics: it is
a relativistic invariant.

19. From practical point of view the role of mass
of a particle is decreasing with increase of
its energy.

24. Note that for electric potential the splitting

is constant:

E0e = m∗ + eφe .

2. ATOMS IN STATIC GRAVITY

Consider an excited ion He+ in a capasitor:

20. According to General Relativity, the source
and receptor of gravitational ﬁeld is the
density of energy-momentum tensor T ik
which is coupled to gravitational ﬁeld like
density of electric current is coupled to elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld.

For a point-like particle

For a particle at rest (v = 0) mass m is
the source and receptor of gravity: T 00 =
mδ(r).

Thus, according to GR, there is no such no-
tion as gravitational mass mg.

b) the potential near the surface of earth

at height h:

c2 , φ(0) = 0 , g = 9.8 m s−2 .

22. E0g = m + mφ = m(1 + φ), E0g

= m.

E0g – rest energy in a static gravitational
ﬁeld. It increases with increasing distance
from the source.

23. For an excited level with mass m∗
E∗

0g = m∗(1 + φ) .

The splitting between levels increases with
h:
∆E0g = E∗

E0g = (m∗

m)(1 + φ) .

25. The frequency ω of a photon emitted in the

process of deexcitation

ω = ∆E0g/h ,

where h = 2π¯h is the Planck constant.
Hence atomic clocks in gravitational ﬁeld
increase their rate with height, as predicted
by Einstein in 1907.

26. This was conﬁrmed by airplane experiments

in 1970s.
Feynman: “atoms at the surface of the
earth are a couple of days older than at its
center”.

27. Thought experiment: Carry clock A from
the ﬁrst ﬂoor to the second. In a year carry
clock B the same way. A will be ahead of
B. ∆T /T = gh/c2. Absolute eﬀect!
This thought experiment is used to get rid
of disparity between a clock on an airplane
and that on a desk. (Think of twin paradox
in special relativity.)

28. Pendulum clocks are not standard clocks
similar to wristwatches, or atomic clocks.
T
They are gravimeters, measuring the
strength of gravitational ﬁeld.

3. PHOTONS IN STATIC GRAV-
ITY

29. In 1911 Einstein predicted redshift of pho-
ton frequency in static gravitational ﬁeld:
the gravitational redshift.

30. In 1960 Pound and Rebka discovered the
shift ∆ω/ω = gh/c2 in 57Fe. Interpretation
in terms of “the weight of the photon”.

31. For static ﬁeld and static observers the
frequency of photon does not depend on
height. (Maxwell equations in static ﬁeld).
Hence the shift observed by Pound et al.
was due to the larger splitting of 57Fe levels
at the top of the Harvard tower. Redshift
of photons relative to clocks.

41. Deceleration of a particle approaching the
sun is a relativistic eﬀect, characteristic not
only to photons, but to any fast enough
particle. M.I. Vysotsky (private commu-
nication) has shown that “enough” means
v∞ > c/√3, where v∞ is velocity of the
particle at r =

.
∞

To prove this consider the expression for en-
ergy of a particle of mass m falling on the
sun along radius r with coordinate veloc-
ity v = dr/dt (use eq. (88.9) from “Field
Theory” by L. Landau and L. Lifshitz):

Thus, the particle accelerates like a non-

4. MISLEADING TERMINOLOGY

42. If,

instead of p = Ev/c2,

the non-
relativistic formula p = mv is kept, then
m = E/c2. This “relativistic mass”, often
denoted as mr, is another notation for en-
ergy.

43. When applied to photon “mγ = Eγ/c2”.

Poincare, Lorentz, Born, Pauli, partly Ein-
stein.

44. Einstein coined the expression “energy -
mass equivalence”, which sometimes he
used in the sense “whenever there is energy,
there is mass”. (Recall massless photon.)

45. A redundant term “rest mass” m0 is abun-

dantly used.

46. Gravitational redshift is interpreted as “loss
of photon’s energy as it climbs out of grav-
itational potential”.

47. From the point of view of relativity no mr,

m0, mg, mi, ml, mt. Only m!

5. UNSOLVED PROBLEMS OF m

48. Is the Higgs mechanism correct?

If yes, we have to discover higgses and to
study the pattern of their couplings.

49. Can the hierarchy problem (mP l

1019
100 GeV) be solved by

≃

≃

GeV vs mZ
SUSY?
If yes, we have to discover numerous su-
perparticles and to ascertain the pattern of
their masses and couplings.

50. SUSY, if conﬁrmed, would lead us into the
quantum dimensions of space and time, into
superspace.

51. Supergravity might lead to superuniﬁcation

of all forces.

52. The scale and mechanism of SUSY breaking

is of paramount importance.

53. What makes the critical energy density of
10−47 GeV4 so small com-
vacuum εc
pared with η4, the density of vacuum ex-
pectation value (VEV) of the Higgs ﬁeld:
η = (246 GeV)?

≃

54. If the recent data on the universe expansion
are correct, how to explain the pattern of
cosmological energy densities of baryons of
dark matter, and of vacuum:

εB/εc

0.03, ΩDM

εDM /εc

0.3 ,

ΩΛ

εΛ/εc

≃

55. Compared with the above enigmas, the
problem of neutrino masses and mixings
may seem to be not so lofty. But it could re-
veal important clues to the concept of mass.

56. A serious twist to the concept of mass was
given by quarks and gluons. The basic def-
inition m2 = E2
p2 is not applicable to
them, as they never exist as free particles
with deﬁnite value of momentum. This col-
ored particles are conﬁned within colorless
hadrons.

−

57. That reminds us that when speaking about
mass of a particle we have to specify the
distance (momentum tranfer q) at which it
is measured. Masses as well as charges are
running functions of q2.
It is not enough
to write down the fundamental Lagrangian.
One has to indicate the scale to which its
couplings and masses refer.

58. At short distances the masses of light u-
quarks and d-quarks, the building blocks
of nucleons, are smaller than 10 MeV,
while masses of nucleons are hundred times
larger. These short-distance quarks are
called “current quarks”.

59. The same quarks with their “gluon coats”
their
called “constituent quarks”,
are
masses being about 300 MeV. There should
exist “constituent gluons”. Hadrons with-
out “valent” quarks are called “glueballs”,
hadrons containing both “valent” quarks
and gluons are referred to as “hybrids”.

60. The quark-antiquark and gluonic vacuum
condensates: < q ¯q >, < GG >, etc. play an
important role. The masses of hadrons ap-
pear due to “burning out” of these (negative
energy density) vacuum condensates inside
hadrons by the intense color ﬁelds of the va-
lent constituents. Though this picture has
not been rigorously proved, it seems evident
that the origin of mass is in vacuum.

61. The existing terminology is obsolete and
non-adequate. Fermions (quarks and lep-
tons) are usually referred to as “matter”,
though neutrinos kinematically behave like
photons. Even very heavy bosons are of-
ten referred to as “radiation”. Actually
all ﬁelds and their quantum excitations (in-
cluding photons) are matter.

Massive vacuum; is it also matter?

62. The literature on the subjects discussed in
this lecture is very vast and controversial.

references in article [1–12]

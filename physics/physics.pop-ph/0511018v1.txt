Abstract We present a ﬂuid-dynamic model for the simulation of urban traﬃc
networks with road sections of diﬀerent lengths and capacities. The
model allows one to eﬃciently simulate the transitions between free
and congested traﬃc, taking into account congestion-responsive traﬃc
assignment and adaptive traﬃc control. We observe dynamic traﬃc
patterns which signiﬁcantly depend on the respective network topol-
ogy. Synchronization is only one interesting example and implies the
emergence of green waves.
In this connection, we will discuss adap-
tive strategies of traﬃc light control which can considerably improve
throughputs and travel times, using self-organization principles based
on local interactions between vehicles and traﬃc lights. Similar adap-
tive control principles can be applied to other queueing networks such as
production systems. In fact, we suggest to turn push operation of traf-
ﬁc systems into pull operation: By removing vehicles as fast as possible
from the network, queuing eﬀects can be most eﬃciently avoided. The
proposed control concept can utilize the cheap sensor technologies avail-
able in the future and leads to reasonable operation modes. It is ﬂexible,

2

adaptive, robust, and decentralized rather than based on precalculated
signal plans and a vulnerable traﬃc control center.

Introduction

Traﬃc control in networks has a long history. Early eﬀorts have aimed
at synchronizing traﬃc signals along a one-way, then a two-way arte-
rial. There is still potential for improvement in this direction, as is at-
tested by some recent research eﬀorts [Stamatiadis and Gartner (1999)]
or prompted by the development of new theoretical tools [Lotito et al.
(2002), Mancinelli et al. (2001)]. Synchronization of traﬃc along ar-
terials results in so-called green-waves, the aim of which is simply to
ensure that traﬃc ﬂows smoothly along main streets. Expected beneﬁts
of green waves are reduced fuel consumption and travel times.

The green-wave approach can be generalized to networks, yielding
pre-calculated signal control schemes, such as TRANSYT [Robertson
(1997)]. In principle such schemes are completely coercive: they force
the traﬃc ﬂow to comply with pre-calculated patterns, optimizing such
criteria as the total travel time spent. Since traﬃc demand varies, the
need for some responsiveness of the signal control was felt very soon.
The SCOOT system [Robertson and Bretherton (1991)], an outgrowth
of TRANSYT, allows for smooth change in the signal settings in response
to changes in the traﬃc demand.

Among the strategies making use of precalculated controls, let us men-
tion SCATS [Sims and Dobinson (1979), Lin and Chen (2004)], which
relies on a library of controls (green durations, oﬀsets, ...) according
to traﬃc conditions. Even the optimization criterion depends on the
traﬃc state. The system might, at night, minimize the number of stops,
maximize throughput at day time under normal conditions, and aim at
postponing the onset of congestion under heavy traﬃc conditions.

More recent developments stress greater adaptability. For instance
UTOPIA [Mauro and Di Taranto (1989)] combines a regional control
based on prediction of traﬃc ﬂow through the main network arteries
with the action of local intersection controllers. The regional control
simply serves as a reference for local control.

OPAC [Gartner (1990)] optimizes queues in accordance with the
“store-and-forward” concept [Papageorgiou (1991)], based on dynamic

Self-Organized Control of Irregular or Perturbed Network Traﬃc

3

programming, with a rolling horizon. OPAC is fundamentally designed
to manage intersections but extends to networks.

Even more decentralized and demand-responsive at a very local level,
PRODYN [Henry and Farges (1989)] optimizes traﬃc at intersections by
switching traﬃc lights on a traﬃc-actuated basis. Optimality is achieved
through the dynamic programming technique. PRODYN also tries to
coordinate neighboring intersections.

A further development includes dynamic assignment into the calcula-
tion of optimal traﬃc light settings as well as non-mandatory manage-
ment schemes (user information). METACOR [Elloumi et al. (1994)],
based on an optimal control strategy with a rolling horizon, is a good
example of this approach. In the same line of approach, TUC [Diakaki
et al. (2003)] displays two innovative features:

1. a reference strategy is calculated for the network (for a given sit-

uation),

2. a ﬁlter is included into the algorithm which calculates the com-
mands. The aim of the ﬁlter is to detect and adjust deviations
from the nominal traﬃc situation, and also to detect in real time
deviations in parameter values.

A notable trend in recent research on demand-responsive traﬃc man-
agement systems is greater reliance on artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) meth-
ods, prompted by an ever growing complexity of algorithms, models and
data. Let us cite some examples of this trend: [Li et al. (2004), Sayers
et al. (1998), Niittym¨aki (2002)] and CLAIRE [Sc´emama (1994)].
Overall, no matter how sophisticated these classical approaches,

either their responsiveness is limited and they appear as tools both
coercive and normative (imposing a traﬃc situation rather than
responding to it),

or they are completely demand-responsive (CLAIRE or PRODYN
for instance) and lack a global coordination. The TUC strategy
might be viewed as a nice compromise.

All classical approaches require vast amounts of data collection and pro-
cessing, as well as huge processing power. Further, global coordination
notoriously requires data diﬃcult to obtain or elaborate such as dy-
namic origin-destination matrices or dynamic assignment data. Finally,
the systems described so far have a diﬃcult time responding to excep-
tional events, accidents, temporary building sites or other changes in
the road network, natural or industrial disasters, catastrophes, terrorist
attacks etc.

4

Hence the usefulness of the decentralized and self-organized approach
advocated in this paper is its greater degree of ﬂexibility, its indepen-
dence of a central traﬃc control center, and its greater robustness with
respect to local perturbations or failures. As shown in Sec. 1.4 and
summarized in Sec. 1.5, our autonomous adaptive control based on a
traﬃc-responsive self-organization of traﬃc lights leads to reasonable
operations, including synchronization patterns such as green waves. In
particular, our principle of self-control is suited for irregular (i.e. non-
Manhattan type) road networks with counterﬂows, with main roads (ar-
terials) and side roads, with varying inﬂows, and with changing turning
or assignment fractions. This distinguishes our approach from simpli-
ﬁed scenarios investigated elsewhere [Brockfeld et al. (2001), Fouladvand
and Nematollahi (2001), Huang and Huang (2003)]. Another interest-
ing feature is that our approach considers not only “pressures” on the
traﬃc lights related to delay times. It also takes into account “counter-
pressures” when subsequent road sections are full, i.e. when green times
cannot be eﬀectively used.

2.

Modeling traﬃc ﬂow in urban road networks

In our model of urban road traﬃc, road networks are composed of
nodes (intersections, plazas, dead ends, or cross sections of the road),
which are connected by directed links i, representing homogeneous road
sections without changes in capacity.

2.1

Traﬃc ﬂow on network links

Figure 1.1. A road network (a) can be considered as a directed graph (b). The
directed links represent homogeneous road sections, while the nodes correspond to
junctions. (c) The road sections may or may not be controlled by traﬃc lights.

Homogeneous road sections.

2.1.1
Our road sections i are
characterized by a constant number Ii of lanes, over which traﬃc is as-
sumed to be equally distributed. Diﬀerent lanes turning into diﬀerent

Self-Organized Control of Irregular or Perturbed Network Traﬃc

5

directions may be treated as separate road sections, depending on the
respective design of the infrastructure. Road sections can have a very
large length Li, which is in favor of numerical eﬃciency. The dynam-
ics within a link of the road network is described by the section-based
queueing-theoretical traﬃc model by Helbing (2003b). It is directly re-
lated to the equation of vehicle conservation [Lighthill and Whitham
(1955)] and brieﬂy introduced, here. The average velocity of vehicles on
link i around place x at time t is denoted by Vi(x, t), the spatial density
per lane by ρi(x, t), and the ﬂow per lane by Qi(x, t) = ρi(x, t)Vi(x, t).
The ﬂow is approximated by a triangular ﬂow-density relationship

Qi(x, t) =

(cid:3)

(cid:26)

(cid:1)
(1.1)
While the increasing line ρiV 0
i describes free traﬃc moving with speed
V 0
in which the
i , the falling “jam line” describes congested traﬃc,
average vehicle distance 1/ρi
is given by an eﬀective vehicle length
leﬀ = 1/ρjam (= vehicle length plus minimum front-bumper-to-back-
bumper distance) plus a safety distance T Vi which grows linearly with
the speed Vi. The proportionality factor is the (safe) time gap T kept in
congested traﬃc. Therefore, our model is based on only three intuitive
parameters: the maximum jam density ρjam, the free velocity V 0
i (speed
limit) on link i, and the time gap in congested traﬃc T . In our paper, we
have chosen V 0
i = 14 m/s = 50 km/h, ρjam = 150 vehicles per kilometer
and lane, and T = 1.8 s.

We should note that there are other macroscopic traﬃc models such
as the non-local, gas-kinetic-based traﬃc (GKT) model [Treiber at al.
(1999)], which can describe the aggregate dynamics of traﬃc ﬂows more
accurately than this model. The “GKT model” has even been suc-
cessfully implemented to simulate traﬃc ﬂows on all German freeways,
taking into account information by local detectors and ﬂoating car data.
However, the dynamics of urban traﬃc is dominated by the dynamics
of the traﬃc lights, which justiﬁes simpliﬁcations in favor of numeri-
cal eﬃciency and analytical treatment. The section-based traﬃc model
covers the most essential features of traﬃc ﬂow in urban road networks,
e.g. the transition between free and congested traﬃc, the spreading and
interaction of vehicle queues, etc. Its particular strengths are its trans-
parency, numerical stability, and computational eﬃciency. Compared to
microsimulation models of urban traﬃc such as cellular automata mod-
els [Cremer and Ludwig (1986), Esser and Schreckenberg (1997), Nagel
et al. (2000)], the treatment of lane changes, intersections, and turning
operations is much easier, and analytical investigations are possible.

6

Propagation of perturbations.

2.1.2
The particular sim-
plicity of the section-based traﬃc model results from its two constant
characteristic velocities: While perturbations of free traﬃc propagate to-
gether with the cars at the speed V 0
i , in congested traﬃc perturbations
travel upstream with the constant velocity

c = −1/(T ρjam) ,

(1.2)

which has the typical value of −3.7 m/s or −13.3 km/h.

A favorable property of the section-based traﬃc model is that all
relevant quantities can be determined from the boundary ﬂows, which
makes the model very eﬃcient. For example, the dynamics inside a
road section i can be easily derived from the arrival ﬂow Qarr
i (t) and the
departure ﬂow Qdep
(t) per lane with the two characteristic velocities V 0
i
and c, see Fig. 1.2.

That is, the ﬂow is determined by the downstream boundary in the area

ﬂow in the area x < Li − li(t) of free traﬃc. The density can be obtained

The temporal change of the number Ni(t) of vehicles per lane on road

The time-dependent change of the congested area of length li(t) will be
discussed in the next paragraph.

Movement of congestion fronts.

2.1.3
Since our road sec-
tions are homogeneous by deﬁnition, congestion can only be triggered
at their downstream ends. While the congested area might eventually
expand over the entire road section, the downstream end remains at
x = Li. The upstream end lies at x = Li − li(t), where jumps ∆ρi and
∆Qi occur in the density and in the ﬂow, respectively. In order to ensure
the conservation of vehicles, the condition ∆Qi = −∆ρi · dli/dt must be
fulﬁlled. Therefore, the border line between free and congested traﬃc
moves with the following velocity [Helbing (2003b)]:

Note that, within the congested area of length li(t), one might ﬁnd areas

This value corresponds to vehicles accelerating out of a traﬃc jam every
T = 1.8 seconds. Nevertheless, the value 1/T is not completely reached,
as each subsequent vehicle has to drive an additional distance leﬀ =
1/ρjam in order to reach the respective measurement cross section. This
requires an additional time interval of leﬀ /V 0
i as in the formula above
(see Fig. 1.3).

Let us shortly discuss two special cases of formula (1.6): If the depar-
ture ﬂow is stopped due to a red traﬃc light, we obtain the simpliﬁed

Figure 1.3.
Illustration of queued vehicles (triangles in the lower left corner) and
freely moving vehicles after a traﬃc light turns green (triangles in the upper right
part). The characteristic speeds V 0 and c are indicated by diagonal lines.

If the traﬃc light turns green at time t′
0, the end of the traﬃc jam
still propagates upstream at the speed (1.8) with new arriving vehicles.
However, at the same time, an area of quasi-free traﬃc with maximum
ﬂow Qmax
propagates upstream with velocity c from the downstream
boundary. Therefore, the eﬀective length leﬀ

i (t) of the vehicle queue is

i

i (t) = li(t) − |c|(t − t′
leﬀ

0) .

(1.9)

If this eﬀective queue has been fully resolved at time t∗, i.e. leﬀ
i (t∗) = 0,
it takes an additional time li(t∗)/V 0
i until the last vehicle of that queue
has left the road section i. Therefore, we reach li(t) = 0 and, thereby,
free traﬃc on the whole road section i, at time t∗ + li(t∗)/V 0
i . Before
this point in time, vehicles that have moved out of the queue may still
be trapped again by a red traﬃc light at the end of road section i.

Travel time.

2.1.4
Let the travel time Ti(t) be the time a
vehicle needs to pass through the road section i when entering it at time
t. Then, the actual number Ni(t) of vehicles inside the road section is
given by

Ni(t) =

dt′ Qdep
i

(t′) .

(1.10)

how the travel time Ti depends on the boundary ﬂows [Helbing (2003b)]:

(1.11)

According to this, the travel time can be predicted based on the antici-
pated departure ﬂow, e.g. when a certain traﬃc light control is assumed
(see Secs. 1.2.1.5 and 1.4.3).

(cid:1)

(cid:0)

Delay time.

2.1.5
Since the travel time would exactly be
Li/V 0
i without congestion, any deviation from that can be understood
as the time a vehicle has been delayed due to congestion. Therefore, we
may introduce the delay time

T del

(t) = Ti −

(1.12)

Since Li/V 0

i /dt as well.

Consider a road section with a constant arrival ﬂow Qarr

i (t) and a
departure ﬂow Qdep
being controlled by a traﬃc light.
As the buﬀer size is given by the maximum number Liρjam of vehicles
per lane on road section i, from Eq. (1.5) we can derive

For t → ∞ we can see that the average arrival rate per lane on road
section i should not exceed the maximum ﬂow times the green time
fraction ui. Otherwise, we will have a growing queue, until the maximum
storage capacity IiLiρjam for vehicles on road section i has been reached.

(1.13)

(1.14)

10

The throughput is reduced if a downstream road section j is sometimes
fully congested, as this limits the departure ﬂow. Moreover, the delay
time can temporarily increase, if the arrival of vehicles at the upstream
boundary of road section i is not synchronized with the green phase
of the traﬃc light at the downstream end. Such a synchronization of
arrivals in i with the desired departure times is hard to reach in an
irregular road network. As a consequence, vehicles tend to queue up at
a red light before they can leave a road section i (see Fig. 1.4). Note,
however, that a green light reaches maximum eﬃciency when it serves
vehicles which have queued up before.

Figure 1.4. Trajectories of freely moving vehicles (diagonal lines) and queued ve-
hicles (horizontal lines) in dependence of the traﬃc light control at two subsequent
intersections 1 and 2. In all four displayed scenarios, vehicles arrive with identical
time headways (i.e. constant arrival rate) at traﬃc light 1, which operates periodi-
cally. Traﬃc light 2 is operated in diﬀerent modes: (a) The frequency and time oﬀset
are adapted to the ﬁrst traﬃc light, as required by a green wave. (b) The frequency
is the same as for the ﬁrst traﬃc light, but has a non-optimal time oﬀset. (c) The
frequency (and cycle time) diﬀers from the one of the ﬁrst traﬃc light. (d) The green
time varies stochastically, but the average green time fraction is the same. When
the frequencies are the same, but the time oﬀset is not properly adjusted, a certain
fraction of vehicles is stopped, see (b). If the frequencies are diﬀerent, it is most likely
that vehicles will be stopped by a red light, potentially even for several times, see (c).
In such cases, a stochastic variation of green time periods can be favorable, see (d).

Let us now study the case where the waiting queues cannot be cleared
completely within one green phase. How long is a vehicle delayed, if it
joins a queue of length li(t0) at time t0? The totally required green time

T req

(t0) =

li(t0)ρjam
Qmax
i

,

(1.15)

since li(t0)ρjam is the number of vehicles per lane to be served and Qmax
the service rate. Let us now estimate the overall time passed until the
downstream boundary of road section i is reached. It is given by the
formula

i

T pass
i

(t0) = T req

i

(t0) + overall red and yellow times in between. (1.16)

The time delay of vehicle i by queuing, red and yellow times is the

i (cid:19)
Generally, this formula is diﬃcult to express, as its result depends sen-
sitively on the respective red and green phases. However, the formula
for the average delay time becomes quite simple. Just remember that
the average green time fraction is ui and the average fraction of red and
yellow times must be 1 − ui. Therefore, the average delay T del
as a
function of the average queue length li and the green time fraction ui is
estimated by the formula

According to this, the average delay time T del
is proportional to the
average queue length li, but a large green time fraction ui is helpful. Note
that the formulas of this section are not only applicable to situations
with ﬁxed cycle times and signal programs. They are also applicable to
situations where the red and green phases are varying.

Potential ﬂows and traﬃc states.

2.1.6
The in- and outﬂow
of a road section is not only limited by capacity constraints such as
Qmax
, but also by the actual state of traﬃc. We will, therefore, denote
i
the potential arrival and departure ﬂows per lane by Qarr,pot
(t) and

i

12

i

(t) > Qdep,pot
i

(t), respectively. Congestion is triggered if Qdep

Qdep,pot
(t),
and resolved if li(t) = 0. In the case where the road section is entirely
congested, i.e. li(t) = Li, this state remains until Qarr
(t).
The potential ﬂows are determined as follows: As long as there is no
congestion, the potential departure ﬂow is given by the former arrival
ﬂow Qarr
i ). When the downstream end of road section i is
congested, vehicles are queued up and can depart with the maximum
possible ﬂow Qmax

i (t) < Qarr,pot

. Altogether, we have

i (t − Li/V 0

i

Qdep,pot

i

(t) =

Qarr
i (t − Li/V 0
i )
Qmax
i

if li(t) = 0 ,
if li(t) > 0 .

(1.19)

(cid:26)
At the upstream end, the maximum possible ﬂow Qmax
can enter road
section i as long as it is not entirely congested. Otherwise, the arrival
ﬂow is limited by the former departure ﬂow Qdep
(t−Li/|c|). This implies

(1.20)

In cases, where the outﬂow of the road section is to be controlled by a
traﬃc light, the potential departure ﬂow Qdep,pot
(t) must be multiplied
with a prefactor γi(t). A green light corresponds to γi(t) = 1, a red
light to γi(t) = 0. Note that it is also possible to vary γi(t) gradually to
account for drivers passing the signal during yellow phases.

Traﬃc ﬂows through network nodes

A node of the road network connects one or several incoming road
sections i with one or several outgoing road sections j, see ﬁgure 1.5(a).
It may represent a junction or a link of two subsequent homogeneous
road sections i and i + 1 with diﬀerent speed limits V 0
i+1 or numbers
Ii, Ii+1 of lanes. Since nodes are assumed to have no storage capacity,
the total in- and outﬂow have to be the same (Kirchhoﬀ’s law):

(a) A node of the road network distributes the vehicular ﬂows between
the road sections that are connected to it. It makes sense to distinguish two special
cases: (b) merges into a single road section and (c) diverges from one road section
into several others.

Merges.

2.2.1
In the case where traﬃc ﬂows from several
incoming road sections i merge into one outgoing road section j, as shown
in Fig. 1.5(b), two cases can be distinguished: As long as the subsequent
road section j has suﬃcient capacity to admit the potential ﬂows of
all incoming road sections i, i.e. Qarr,pot
(t), the ﬂow
j
through the node is given by the upstream traﬃc conditions in the road
sections i. Otherwise, some of the upstream departure ﬂows Qdep
(t) have
to be restricted. But which ones? According to practical experience,
small traﬃc ﬂows Qdep
(t) can almost always squeeze in, while ﬂows from
equivalent roads tend to share the capacity Qarr,pot
equally. Note that in
scenarios with main roads having a right of way, the corresponding ﬂow
is to be served ﬁrst. The remaining capacity is subsequently distributed
among the side roads.

2.2.2
Figure 1.5(c) shows the case where traﬃc di-
verges from one road section into several others. This is, for example, the
case when a road splits up into lanes for turning left, continuing straight
ahead, or turning right. For diverges, the throughput is determined by
a cascaded minimum-function:

(1.25)

The ﬁrst term on the right-hand side is obvious, as any restriction of
the potential departure ﬂow Qdep,pot
(t) of road section i limits the ﬂows
to all outgoing road sections j. The second term on the right-hand side
follows from the fact that the fraction αij of the departure ﬂow Qdep

to any subsequent road section j is limited by its potential arrival ﬂow

In the special case of a node connecting only two subsequent road sec-

by the minimum of both potential ﬂows:

Traﬃc assignment

i

The simplest way to model turning at intersections is by turning coeﬃ-
cients αij(t), which assume that a certain fraction αij(t) of the departure
ﬂow Qdep
(t) turns into road section j. In many theoretical studies, the
coeﬃcients αij are kept constant. However, it is well-known that the
turning fractions vary in the course of the day, which is often taken into
account by using historical, time-dependent turning coeﬃcients αij(t)
from a database [Chrobok et al. (2000)]. Moreover, even if the same
origin-destination ﬂows would repeat each week, delays due to pertur-
bations in the traﬃc ﬂow (e.g. due to an accident) would cause diﬀerent
time-dependent turning fractions. Therefore, a better treatment is based
on dynamic traﬃc assignment.

In order to integrate dynamic traﬃc assignment in our model, let
us denote the destination node of vehicles by d. Moreover, let Nid(t)
represent the number of driver-vehicle units on the directed link i, which
ﬁnally want to arrive at d. This implies

Ni(t) =

Nid(t) .

Finally, let j be the starting node of link j and j = k its ending node.
Moreover, let Tjk(t) be the travel time on link j and
Tkd(t) the mini-
mum travel time between two nodes k and d (as can, for example, be
b
determined by the Dijkstra algorithm). Then, the minimum travel time
to note d via link j (i.e. node k) is given by Tjk(t) +
Tkd(t), and the
minimum travel time
Tjd(t) from node j to destination d at time t is
determined via

b

Tjd(t) = min

b

[Tjk(t) +

Tkd(t)] ,

k

(1.30)

where the minimum function extends over all successors k of node j.
Instead of this, we may use the following approximate relationship:

b

b

Tjd(t) = min

[Tjk(t) +

Tkd(t − ∆t)] .

k

(1.31)

b

The advantage of (1.31) over (1.30) is that the information about travel
times gradually propagates to the present location of the car (namely by
one link each time step ∆t). A delayed evaluation of Dijkstra’s short-
est path algorithm saves computer time and models this information
ﬂow, the speed of which is controlled by ∆t. Another advantage is the
determination of travel times based on a local algorithm.

b

Based on this travel time information, we may distribute the departure
ﬂows Qd,dep
(t) over neighboring links according to a multinomial logit
model [Ben-Akiva, McFadden et al. (1999)]. Accordingly, we specify the
turning probabilities of cars with destination d at node j = i as

where i = j and j = k. This assumes individual route choice decisions
without central coordination, i.e. selﬁsh routing.

We must still decide how to determine travel times. On the one hand,
one may use the expected travel times Tjk(t) = Tjj(t) = Tj(t) according
to Eq. (1.11) (or, as a second best alternative, the instantanous link
travel times). On the other hand, one may use travel time information
T ∗
(2000)].
jk(t) of comparable days from a database [Chrobok et al.
While for close links, the expected travel time may be a good (and the
instantaneous travel time a reasonable) estimate of the actual travel
time, it becomes less reliable the more remote the respective link is. For
remote links, a travel time estimate based on measurements of similar
previous days may be more reliable. Therefore, we propose to use a
weighted mean value generalizing formula (1.31):

Tjd(t) = min

[Tjk(t)+e−λ Tjk(t)

Tkd(t−∆t)+(1−e−λ Tjk(t))T ∗

kd(t)] . (1.34)

k

b

In this formula, the travel time T ∗
kd(t) from node k to d is taken from a
database, the weights are exponentially decaying with increasing travel
times, and λ > 0 is a suitably chosen calibration parameter.

b

Right now it is not clear what happens if traﬃc lights adapt to the
traﬃc situation and drivers try to adjust to the traﬃc lights at the
same time. Driver adaptation is a reasonable strategy for signal plans
that are ﬁxed or determined by the time of the day. However, it may
perturb attempts to optimize traﬃc by self-organized control. Therefore,
the study of route choice behavior in the context of adaptive traﬃc
light control requires careful study. A method to stabilize the system
dynamics, if needed, would be road pricing (see Sec. 1.5.1.1).

4.

Self-organized traﬃc light control

4.1 Why traﬃc lights?

i

For the illustration of the advantages of oscillatory traﬃc control, let
us assume a conventional four-armed intersection with identical capac-
ities Qmax
= Qmax. The arrival time of vehicles shall be stochastic.
Vehicles are assumed to obstruct the intersection area (i.e. the node)
for a time period of 1/Qmax in case of compatible ﬂow directions. For
incompatible, e.g. crossing ﬂows, the blockage time shall be τ = sT with
s > 1. The maximum average throughput Qcap of the intersection is,
therefore, bounded by the following inequality:

1
T

> Qmax ≥ Qcap ≥

=

1
τ

1
sT

.

(1.35)

Self-Organized Control of Irregular or Perturbed Network Traﬃc

17

The exact value of Qcap depends on the fractions of compatible and
incompatible ﬂows. For compatible ﬂows only, we have Qcap = Qmax.
If the vehicle ﬂows were always incompatible, one would have Qcap =
1/τ = 1/(sT ).

Let us now cluster vehicles into platoons of n vehicles by the use of
suitable adaptive traﬃc lights. Moreover, let the green phases last for
the time periods ∆τi. Between the green periods, we will need yellow
lights for a time period of τ to prevent accidents. An estimate of the
capacity Qcap of the signalized intersection is then

Qcap =

where T cyc = kτ +
i ∆τi is the average cycle time. Of course, there
are diﬀerent possible schemes to control the intersection, but we can
show that for n-vehicle platoons with ∆τi = n/Qmax, the capacity of
the signalized intersection is

(cid:18)

(cid:19)
i.e. if s or n are large enough.
In other words: Forming vehicle pla-
toons (clusters) by oscillatory traﬃc lights can increase the intersection
capacity. This, however, requires that the green times are fully used.
Otherwise, at small arrival rates, traﬃc lights would potentially delay
vehicles.

Despite of the simpliﬁcations made in the above considerations, the
following conclusions are quite general: It is most eﬃcient if vehicles
can pass the intersection immediately one by one, if the arrival rates are
small. Above a certain threshold, however, it is more eﬃcient to form
vehicle platoons by means of traﬃc lights. This is certainly the case, if
the sum of arrival ﬂows exceeds the capacity of an unsignalized intersec-
tion with incompatible ﬂows. According to formula (1.36), the capacity
of a signalized intersection can be increased by increasing the green time
fractions ∆τi/T cyc. This can be done by increasing the cycle time T cyc
in cases of high arrival ﬂows Qarr
. Thereby, the relative blockage time
by yellow lights is reduced.

4.2

Self-induced oscillations

In pedestrian counterﬂows at bottlenecks, one can often observe os-
cillatory changes of the passing direction, as if the pedestrian ﬂows were
controlled by a traﬃc light.
Inspired by this, we have suggested to
generalize this principle to the self-organized control of intersecting ve-
hicle ﬂows [see the newspaper article by Stirn (2003)]. This idea was
described in 2003 in the DFG proposal He 2789/5-1 entitled “Self-
organized traﬃc signal control based on synchronization phenomena
in driven many-particle systems and supply networks”. The control
concept elaborated in the meantime has been submitted for a patent.
For visualizations of some traﬃc scenarios see the videos available at
www.trafficforum.org/trafficlights/.

Figure 1.6. Alternating pedestrian ﬂows at a bottleneck. These oscillations are self-
organized and occur due to a pressure diﬀerence between the waiting crowd on one
side and the crowd on the other side passing the bottleneck [after Helbing and Moln´ar
(1995), Helbing (1997)].

Oscillations are a organization pattern of conﬂicting ﬂows which al-
lows to optimize the overall throughput under certain conditions (see
Sec. 1.4.1). In pedestrian ﬂows (see Fig. 1.6), the mechanism behind the
self-induced oscillations is as follows: Pressure builds up on that side of
the bottleneck where more and more pedestrians have to wait, while it
is reduced on the side where pedestrians can move ahead and pass the
bottleneck. If the pressure on one side exceeds the pressure on the other
side by a certain amount, the passing direction is changed.

Transferring this self-organization principle to urban vehicle traﬃc,
we deﬁne red and green phases in a way that considers “pressures” on
the traﬃc light by road sections waiting to be served and “counter-
pressures” from the subsequent road sections depending on the degree
of congestion on them. Generally speaking, these pressures depend on
delay times, queue lengths, or potentially other quantities as well. The

Self-Organized Control of Irregular or Perturbed Network Traﬃc

19

proposed control principle is self-organized, autonomous, and adaptive
to the respective local traﬃc situation, as will be shown below.

4.3

Basic switching rules for traﬃc lights

Our switching rules for traﬃc lights will have to solve the following

control problems:

The number of vehicles on a road section served by a green time
period should be proportional to the average arrival ﬂows Qarr
, at
least if these are small.

i

In order to avoid time losses due to yellow lights, switching of traf-
ﬁc lights should be minimized under saturated traﬃc conditions.
However, single vehicles and small queues need to be served as well
after some maximum cycle time T max.

Despite of the desire to maintain green lights as long as possible,
signal control should be able to react to changing traﬃc conditions
in a ﬂexible way. Unfortunately, the change of traﬃc conditions
depends on traﬃc light control itself, so that a reliable forecast is
only possible over short time periods.

Under suitable conditions, traﬃc lights should synchronize them-
selves to establish green waves.

The synchronization of traﬃc lights is not only a matter of the ad-
justment of green and red time periods, i.e. of the frequency of control
cycles: The adaptation of the time oﬀset is also crucial for the establish-
ment of green waves. While the adaptation problem is easily solvable
for Manhattan-like road networks, the situation for irregular road net-
works is much more complex. Green waves may, in fact, cause major
obstructions of crossing ﬂows. Therefore, it is a great diﬃculty to ﬁnd
suitable rules which ﬂows to prioritize. While addressing these points
in the next paragraphs, we will develop a suitable control approach step
by step. The resulting control principles may be also used to resolve
conﬂicts between competing ﬂows in other complex systems like produc-
tion networks [Helbing (2003a, 2004, 2005), Helbing et al. (2004)], see
Sec. 1.5.1.2.

The philosophy of our traﬃc light control is the minimization of the
cumulative or average travel time and, therefore, of the cumulative delay
time. Minimizing the overall delay time means to serve as many vehicles
by the traﬃc lights as possible, i.e. to maximize the average departure
rate (the average throughput). Let us explain this principle in more
detail: If the traﬃc light is red or yellow, we have γi(t) = 0 and the

20

overall departure rate is IiQdep



A green light should be provided for the road section whose vehicle ﬂow
during a certain future time period is expected to be highest, taking into
account any yellow-light related time losses. This principle tends to serve
the road with the largest outﬂow, i.e. the largest number Ii of lanes (see
the third condition). However, it matters how long the maximum ﬂow
can be maintained, i.e. how large the number number Iiliρjam of queued
vehicles is. Moreover, vehicles in road section i will be hardly able to
depart (see the second condition), if one of the subsequent road sections
j is completely congested by the expected number IiQmax
0) of
vehicles arriving between time t′
0 and t. That is, a green light starting

where t1 − t′
0 denotes the expected green time. However, generalizations
of this formula are needed for the treatment of low traﬃc (see Sec. 1.4.5)
and green waves (see Sec. 1.4.6).

As our control philosophy requires to reduce queues as fast as possible,
the decision to serve a certain road section i should be based on the
0), where the sum extends over all ﬂows

Note that formula (1.43) implies that, given an equal number of lanes,
green times are more likely for long queues, which could be said to
exert some “pressure” on the traﬃc light. However, if road sections j
demanded by turning ﬂows are congested, this exerts some “counter-
pressure”. This will suppress green lights in cases where they would
not allow to serve vehicles, i.e. where they would not make sense. As
a consequence, while cycle times increase with growing arrival rates as
long as these can be served, they may go down again when the road
network is too congested.

4.4

Oscillations at a merge bottleneck

For the purpose of illustration, let us discuss a merge bottleneck (see
Fig. 1.8). The two merging road sections i ∈ {1, 2} shall have the overall
capacities IiQmax with I1 ≥ I2, while the subsequent section j shall have
the capacity IjQmax ≥ I1Qmax, so that no congestion will occur in the
subsequent road section. Let us assume that the arrival ﬂows Qarr
are
constant in time. Furthermore, let us assume that the traﬃc light for
road section 2 turns red at times t0, t2, etc., while the red lights for road
section 1 start at t1, t3, etc. The green times for road section 1 begin
after an yellow time period of τ , i.e. at times t′
2k = t2k + τ and last for
the time periods t2k+1 − t′

i

2k.

We can distinguish the following cases:

1. Equivalent road sections:

If I1 = I2, the queues on both road
sections will be completely cleared in an alternating way, see
Fig. 1.7(a).
In case of growing vehicle queues, the green times
grow accordingly.

2. One main and one side road (I1 > I2):

(i) If the arrival ﬂow Qarr

2 of road section 2 (the side road) is low,

both roads are completely cleared.

22

(ii) In many cases, however, the queue length in the side road
grows in the course of time, while the queue in the main road
(road section 1) is completely cleared, see Fig. 1.7(b). As a
consequence, road section 2 will be fully congested after some
time period, which limits a further growth of the queue and
discourages drivers to use this road section according to our
traﬃc assignment rule. In extreme cases, when no maximum
cycle time is implemented (see Sec. 1.4.4.3), the main road
may have a green light all the time, while road section 2 (the
side road) is never served, see Fig. 1.7(c).

(iii) If the sum

i IiQarr
i

of overall arrival ﬂows exceeds the ca-
pacity IjQmax of the subsequent road section j, the queue on
both road sections will grow, see Fig. 1.7(d).

P

We will now discuss these cases in more detail.

Figure 1.7. Diﬀerent cases of the self-organized control of a merge bottleneck: (a)
The vehicle queue in each road section is completely cleared, before the traﬃc light
turns red. (b) The traﬃc light in the side road turns red, before the vehicle queue
has fully disappeared, but the main road is fully cleared. (c) In extreme cases, if a
maximum cycle time is not enforced, the side road would never get a green light and
the main road would always be served. (d) When the sum of arrival rates is higher
than the capacity of the subsequent road section, the vehicle queues in both road
sections may grow under certain conditions (see text).

Equivalent road sections.

4.4.1
Let us assume the queue
length on road section 2 is zero at time t0 and the traﬃc light switches
to red in order to oﬀer a green light to road section 1 at time t′
0 = t0 + τ .
The queue length at time t is given by

according to Eq. (1.8). Note that, in the limit of small arrival rates Qarr
,
this queue expansion velocity is proportional to Qarr
. The reduction of
the queue starts with the green phase and is proportional to c. We,
therefore, have the following equation for the length of the eﬀective queue
(= queue length minus area of quasi-free traﬃc):

(1.47)

However, the last vehicle of the queue needs an additional time period

road section 1 becomes zero at time t = t1 with

(1.48)

At that time, the traﬃc light for road section 1 switches to red and road
section 2 is served by a green light starting at t′

considerations show that the queue in road section 2 is cleared at time

2) = l1(t′

consequence, we ﬁnd l1(t′
1 + 2τ ). In the stationary case
we have l1(t′
0) and l1(t1) = 0, as the queue on road section
1 is completely cleared at time t1. This eventually leads to a rather
complicated formula for t2 − t′
1, which is proportional to the respective
queue length. For small values of the arrival rates Qarr
, one can show that
i
the green times are proportional to Ci and Qarr
. That is, the duration
of the green phases is proportional to the arrival rates, as expected, if
the arrival rates are small enough. The cycle time grows linearly with
Qarr

i

1 + Qarr
2 .

One main and one side road.

4.4.2
If both road sections are
completely cleared as in case (i) above, the mathematical treatment is
analogous to the previous section. More interesting is case (ii), in which
the traﬃc light for road section 2 switches to red already before the queue
is cleared completely, see Fig. 1.7(b). While Eqs. (1.48) and (1.50) are
still valid, we have to ﬁnd other expressions for t2 and l1(t′
0). Let
t+
2 be the time point in which the queue of length l1(t2) in road section
1 at time t2 would be completely resolved, if the traﬃc light would turn
green for road section 1 at time t2. Road section 1 could for sure deliver
an overall ﬂow of I1Qmax between t′
2 , while the departure
ﬂow from road section 1 could be much smaller than I1Qmax afterwards.

For I1 = I2, one can immediately see that the traﬃc light would never
switch before the queue in road section 2 is fully resolved. However,
early switching could occur for I1 > I2.

Once the traﬃc light is turned green at time t2, the vehicles which
2 will be served with the overall rate I1Qmax

2 at which the eﬀective queue resolves

have queued up until time t+
as well, until the departure ﬂow is given by the lower arrival ﬂow Qarr

is given by l1(t∗

2) = C1(t′

Afterwards, the overall departure ﬂow drops indeed to I1Qarr
1 , and the
traﬃc light tends to turn red if I1Qarr
1 < I2Qmax. Otherwise, it will
continue to stay green during the whole rush hour. Considering l1(t3) =
0 = l1(t1) and l1(t′
2 − t1), one can determine all quantities.
One can show that the green time fraction for road section 1 grows
proportionally to Qarr
1 , if τ is small. Moreover, one can derive that
the green time fractions of both road sections and the cycle time T cyc =
t3−t1 are proportional to C1, i.e. the main road dominates the dynamics.
The queue length on road section 2 tends to grow, as it is never fully
cleared.

If I1Qarr

1 + I2Qarr

2 > IjQmax, it can also happen that the queues grow
1 > IjQmax,
in both road sections. This is actually the case, if I1Qarr
see Fig. 1.7(d). Moreover, in the case I2Qmax < I1Qarr
1 , road section
2 would never be served, see Fig. 1.7(c). This calls for one of several
possible solutions: 1. Allow turning on red. 2. Decide to transform
the side road into a dead end. 3. Build a bridge or tunnel. 4. Use
roundabouts or other road network designs which do not require traﬃc
lights. 5. Treat main and side roads equivalently, i.e. set I1 = I2 = 1 in
the above formulas, or specify suitable parameter values for Ii, although
it will increase the overall delay times. 6. Restrict the red times to a
maximum value at the cost of increased overall delay times and reduced
intersection throughput.

In order to avoid excessive cycle
times, one has to set upper bounds. This may be done as follows: Let

the green light will be switched to red. This approach also solves the
problem that even small vehicle queues or single vehicles must be served
within some maximum time period.
The green time fractions u0

Serving single vehicles at low traﬃc volumes

i

While traﬃc lights have been invented to eﬃciently coordinate and
serve vehicle ﬂows at high traﬃc volumes, they should ideally provide a
arr
green light for every arriving vehicle at low average arrival rates Q
.
i
According to formula (1.39), the departure ﬂow Qdep
(t) will, in fact, be
0 most of the time on all road sections. Only during short time periods,
single vehicles will randomly cause positive values of Qarr
i (t − Li/V 0
i )
on one of the road sections i. The traﬃc light should be turned green
shortly before the arrival of the vehicle at the downstream boundary of
this road section. If switching requires a time period of τ , the arrival
ﬂow Qarr
i + τ ) would need to trigger a switching of the traﬃc
light in favor of road section i. Considering this and formula (1.39),
it is essential to take a switching decision based on the departure ﬂow
Qdep
(t) can,
i
in fact, be forecasted for a certain time period based on available ﬂow
data and assumed states of neighboring signals. In order to minimize
the time period τ , it makes sense to switch any traﬃc light to red, if

(t + τ ) expected at time t + τ . The departure ﬂow Qdep

i (t − Li/V 0

28

no other vehicle is following. That is, at low traﬃc volumes, all traﬃc
lights would be red most of the time. However, any single vehicle would
trigger an anticipative green light upon arrival, so that vehicles would
basically never have to wait at a red light.

4.6

Emergence of green waves through
self-organized synchronization

In order to let green waves emerge in a self-organized way, the control
strategy must show a tendency to form vehicle groups, i.e. convoys, and
to serve them just as they approach an intersection. For this to happen,
small vehicle clusters must potentially be delayed, which gives them a
chance to grow. When they are released, the corresponding “convoys”
may themselves trigger a green wave.

i

j

j = Qmax

In fact, the ideal situation would be that traﬃc ﬂow from road section
i arrives at location Lj − lj(t) in a subsequent road section j just when
the eﬀective queue leﬀ
j (t) has resolved. This is equivalent with the need
to arrive at location Lj just at the moment when the queue length lj(t)
becomes zero. Under such conditions, free arrival ﬂows Qarr
j (t − Lj/V 0
j )
with values around Qmax
would immediately follow the high outﬂow
Qdep
from the (resolving) congested area in road section j (here,
we assume Ii = Ij). As a consequence, the green light at the end of road
section j would be likely to continue. This mechanism could establish
a synchronization among traﬃc lights, i.e. a green wave by suitable ad-
justment of the time oﬀsets, triggered by vehicle ﬂows. As it requires a
time period ∆tj = [Lj −lj(t)]/V 0
j to reach the upstream congestion front
in section j, it will be required to turn the signal of the previous road
section i green a time period ∆tj before the eﬀective queue is expected
to resolve. This time period deﬁnes the necessary forecast time interval.
j (t) is resolved, the related sud-
den increase in Lj − lj(t) can cause a sudden increase in ∆N pot
and,
thereby, possibly trigger a switching of the traﬃc light. The emergence
of green waves obviously requires that the green light at the end of road
section j should stay long enough to resolve the queue. This is likely,
if road section j is a main road (arterial), see our considerations in
Sec. 1.4.4.2.

When the eﬀective queue of length leﬀ

i

In a more abstract sense, the intersections in the road network can be
understood as self-sustained oscillators which are coupled by the vehicle
ﬂows between them. Therefore, one might expect them to synchronize
like many natural systems do [Pikovsky et al. (2001)]. Interestingly, even
if the intersections are not coupled artiﬁcially with some communication
feedback, the weak coupling via vehicle ﬂows is suﬃcient to let larger

Self-Organized Control of Irregular or Perturbed Network Traﬃc

29

areas of the road network synchronize. The serving direction percolates
through the network, stabilizes itself for a while and is then taken over
by another serving direction. In other words, neighboring intersections
aﬀect each other by interactions via vehicle ﬂows, which favors a mutual
adjustment of their rhythms. This intrinsic mechanism introduces order,
so that vehicle ﬂows are coordinated.

5.

Summary and outlook

In this contribution, we have presented a section-based traﬃc model
for the simulation and analysis of network traﬃc. Moreover, we have pro-
posed a decentralized control strategy for traﬃc ﬂows, which has certain
interesting features: Single arriving vehicles always get a green light.
When the intersection is busy, vehicles are clustered, resulting in an
oscillatory and eﬃcient service (even of intersecting main ﬂows). If pos-
sible, vehicles are kept going in order to avoid capacity losses produced
by stopped vehicles. This principle bundles ﬂows, thereby generating
main ﬂows (arterials) and subordinate ﬂows (side roads and residential
If a road section cannot be used due to a building site or an
areas).
accident, traﬃc ﬂexibly re-organizes itself. The same applies to diﬀerent
demand patterns in cases of mass events, evacuation scenarios, etc. Fi-
nally, a local dysfunction of sensors or control elements can be handled
and does not aﬀect the overall system. A large-scale harmonization of
traﬃc lights is reached by a feedback between neighboring traﬃc lights
based on the vehicle ﬂows themselves, which can synchronize traﬃc sig-
nals and organize green waves. In summary, the system is self-organized
based on local information, local interactions, and local processing, i.e.
decentralized control. However, a multi-hierarchical feedback may fur-
ther enhance system performance by increasing the speed of large-scale
information exchange and the speed of synchronization in the system.

We should point out some interesting diﬀerences compared to conven-

tional traﬃc control:

The green phases of a traﬃc light depend on the respective traﬃc
situation on the previous and the subsequent road sections. They
are basically determined by actual and expected queue lengths and
delay times. If no more vehicles need to be served or one of the
subsequent road sections is full, green times for one direction will
be terminated in favor of green times for other directions. The
default setting corresponds to red lights, as this enables one to
respond quickly to approaching traﬃc. Therefore, during light
traﬃc conditions, single vehicles can trigger a green light upon
arrival at the traﬃc signal.

30

Our approach does not use precalculated or predetermined signal
plans. It is rather based on self-organized red and green phases.
In particularly, there is no ﬁxed cycle time or a given order of
green phases. Some roads may be even served more frequently
than others. For example, at very low traﬃc volumes it can make
sense to serve the same road again before all other road sections
have been served. In other words, traﬃc optimization is not just
a matter of green times and their permutation.

Instead of a traﬃc control center, we suggest a distributed, local
control in favor of greater ﬂexibility and robustness. The required
information can be gathered by optical or infrared sensors, which
will be cheaply available in the future. Complementary informa-
tion can be obtained by a coupling with simulation models. Apart
from the section-based model proposed in this paper, one can also
use other (e.g. microsimulation) models with or without stochastic-
ity, as our control approach does not depend on the traﬃc model.
Travel time information to enhance route choice decisions may be
transmitted by mobile communication.

Pedestrians could be detected by modern sensors as well and han-
dled as additional traﬃc streams. Alternatively, they may get
green times during compatible green phases for vehicles or after
the maximum cycle time T max. Public transport (e.g. busses or
trams) may be treated as vehicles with a higher weight. A natural
choice for the weight would be the average number of passengers.
This would tend to prioritize public transport and to give it a
green light upon arrival at an intersection. In fact, a prioritization
of public transport harmonizes much better with our self-organized
traﬃc control concept than with precalculated signal plans.

5.1

Future research directions

Towards the system optimum.

5.1.1
Traﬃc ﬂow optimiza-
tion in networks is not just a matter of durations, frequencies, time
oﬀsets and the order of green times, which may be adjusted in the way
described above. Conﬂicts of ﬂows and related ineﬃciencies can also be
a result of the following problems:

Space which is urgently required for certain origin-destination ﬂows
may be blocked by other ﬂows, causing a spill-over and blockage of
upstream road sections. One of the reasons for this is the cascaded
minimum function (1.25). It may, therefore, be helpful to restrict

Self-Organized Control of Irregular or Perturbed Network Traﬃc

31

turning only to subsequent road sections that are normally not
fully congested (i.e. wide and/or long road sections).

Giving green times to compatible vehicle ﬂows may cause the
over-proportional service of certain road sections. These over-
proportional ﬂows may be called parasitic. They may cause the
blockage of space in subsequent road sections which would be
needed for other ﬂow directions. In order to avoid parasitic ﬂows,
it may be useful to restrict the green times of compatible ﬂow
directions.

Due to the selﬁsh route choice behavior, drivers tend to distribute
over alternative routes in a way that establishes a Wardrop equi-
librium (also called a Nash or user equilibrium) [Papageorgiou
(1991)]. This reﬂects the tendency of humans to balance travel
times [Helbing et al. (2002)]. That is, all subsequent road sections
j of i used to reach a destination d are characterized by (more
If the travel time on one path was
or less) equal travel times.
less than on alternative ones, more vehicles would choose it, which
would cause more congestion and a corresponding increase in travel
times.

In order to reach the system optimum, which is typically deﬁned by the
minimum of the overall travel times, the drivers have to be coordinated.
This would be able to further enhance the capacity of the traﬃc network,
but it would require the local adaptation of signal control parameters.
For example, the enforcement of optimal green time fractions u0
i based
on the method described in Sec. 1.4.4.3 would be one step into this
direction, as it is not necessarily the best, when green time fractions are
speciﬁed proportionally to the arrival rates Qarr

.

Unfortunately, green time fractions u0

i do not allow to diﬀerentiate
between diﬀerent origin-destination ﬂows using the same road section.
Such a diﬀerentiation would allow one to reserve certain capacities (i.e.
certain fractions of road sections) for speciﬁc ﬂows. This could be
reached by advanced traveller information systems (ATIS) [Hu and Mah-
massani (1997), Mahmassani and Jou (2000), Schreckenberg and Selten
(2004)] together with suitable pricing schemes, which would increase the
attractiveness of some routes compared to others.

i

Diﬀerent road pricing schemes have been proposed, each of which
has its own advantages and disadvantages or side eﬀects. Congestion
charges, for example, could discourage to take congested routes required
to reach minimum average travel times, while conventional tolls and
road pricing may reduce the trip frequency due to budget constraints

32

(which potentially interferes with economic growth and fair chances for
everyone’s mobility).

In order to activate capacity reserves, we therefore propose an au-
tomated route guidance system based on the following principles: Af-
ter speciﬁcation of their destination, drivers should get individual route
choice recommendations in agreement with the traﬃc situation and the
route choice proportions required to reach the system optimum. If an in-
dividual selects a faster route instead of the recommeded route it should,
on the one hand, have to pay an amount proportional to the increase
in the overall travel time compared to the system optimum. On the
other hand, drivers not in a hurry should be encouraged to take the
slower route i by receiving the amount of money corresponding to the
related decrease in travel times. Altogether, such an ATIS could support
the system optimum while allowing for some ﬂexibility in route choice.
Moreover, the fair usage pattern would be cost-neutral for everyone, i.e.
traﬃc ﬂows of potential economic relevance would not be suppressed by
extra costs.

On-line production scheduling.

5.1.2
Our approach to
self-organized traﬃc light control could be also transfered to a ﬂexible
production scheduling, in order to cope with problems of multi-goal opti-
mization, with machine breakdowns, and variations in the consumption
rate. This could, for example, help to optimize the diﬃcult problem of
re-entrant production in the semiconductor industry [Beaumariage and
Kempf (1994), Diaz-Rivera et al. (2000), Helbing (2005)].

In fact, the control of network traﬃc ﬂows shares many features with
the optimization of production processes. For example, travel times cor-
respond to cycle times, cars with diﬀerent origins and destinations to
diﬀerent products, traﬃc lights to production machines, road sections
to buﬀers. Moreover, variations in traﬃc ﬂows correspond to variations
in the consumption rate, congested roads to full buﬀers, accidents to
machine breakdowns, and conﬂicting ﬂows at intersections to conﬂict-
ing goals in production management. Finally, the cascaded minimum
function (1.25) reﬂects the fact that the scarcest resource governs the
maximum production speed:
If a speciﬁc required part is missing, a
product cannot be completed. All of this underlines the large degree of
similarity between traﬃc and production networks [Helbing (2005)]. As
a consequence, one can apply similar methods of description and similar
control approaches.

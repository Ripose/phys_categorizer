Abstract

The conventional discussion of the observed distortions of space and time in
Special Relativity (the Lorentz-Fitzgerald Contraction and Time Dilatation) is ex-
tended by considering observations, from a stationary frame, of : (i) objects moving
with constant velocity and uniformly illuminated during a short time τL (their ‘Lu-
minous Proper Time’) in their rest frame; these may be called ‘Transient Luminous
Objects’ and (ii) a moving, extended, array of synchronised ‘equivalent clocks’ in
a common inertial frame. Application of the Lorentz Transformation to (i) shows
that such objects, observed from the stationary frame with coarse time resolution
in a direction perpendicular to their direction of motion are seen to be at rest but
longer in the direction of the relative velocity ~v by a factor 1/p1 − (v/c)2 (Space
Dilatation) and to (ii) that the moving equivalent clock at any ﬁxed position in
the rest frame of the stationary observer is seen to be running faster than a similar
clock at rest by the factor 1/p1 − (v/c)2 (Time Contraction). All four space-time
‘eﬀects’ of Special Relativity are simply classiﬁed in terms of the projective geome-
try of space-time, and the close analogy of these eﬀects to linear spatial perspective
is pointed out.

Introduction

In his 1905 paper on Special Relativity [1]Einstein showed that Time Dilatation (TD)
and the Lorentz-Fitzgerald Contraction (LFC), which had previously been introduced in
a somewhat ad hoc way into Classical Electrodynamics, are simple consequences of the
Lorentz Transformation (LT), that is, of the geometry of space-time.

As an example of the LFC Einstein stated that a sphere moving with velocity v would,
‘viewed from the stationary system’, appear to be contracted by the factor q1 − ( v
c )2 in
its direction of motion where c is the velocity of light in free space. It was only pointed
out some 54 years later that if ‘viewed’ was interpreted in the conventional sense of ‘as
seen by the eye, or recorded on a photograph’ then the sphere does not at all appear
to be contracted, but is still seen as a sphere with the same dimensions as a stationary
one and at the same position [2, 3, 4] ! It was shown in general [3, 4] that transversely
viewed moving objects subtending a small solid angle at the observer appear to be not
distorted in shape or changed in size, but rather rotated, as compared to a similarly
viewed and orientated object at rest. This apparent rotation is a consequence of three
distinct physical eﬀects:

(i) The LFC.

(ii) Optical Aberration.

(iii) Diﬀerent propagation times of photons emitted by diﬀerent parts of the moving

object.

The eﬀect (ii) may be interpreted as the change in direction of photons, emitted by a
moving source, due to the LT between the rest frames of the source and the stationary
observer. Correcting for (ii) and (iii), the LFC can be deduced as a physical eﬀect, if not
directly observed. It was also pointed out by Weinstein [5] that if a single observer is
close to a moving object then, because of the eﬀect of light propagation time delays, it
will appear elongated if moving towards the observer and contracted (to an extent greater
than the LFC) if moving away. Only an object moving strictly transversely to the line of
sight of a close observer shows the LFC.

However, the LFC itself is a physical phenomenon similar in many ways to (iii) above.
The human eye or a photograph taken with a fast shutter record, as a sharp image, the
photons incident on it during a short resolution time τR. That is, the image corresponds
to a projection at an almost ﬁxed time in the frame S of observation. This implies
that the photons constituting the observed image are emitted at diﬀerent times from the
diﬀerent parts,along the line of sight, of an extended object. As shown below, the LFC
is similarly deﬁned by a ﬁxed time projection in the frame S. The LT then requires that
the photons constituting the image of a moving object are also emitted at diﬀerent times,
in the rest frame S’ of the object, from the diﬀerent parts along its direction of motion.
In the following S will, in general, denote the reference frame of a ‘stationary’ observer
(space-time coordinates x,y,z,t) while S’ refers to the rest frame of an object moving
with uniform velocity v in the direction of the positive x axis relative to S ( space-time
coordinates x’,y’,z’,t’).

1

The purpose of this paper is to point out that the t = constant projection of the LFC
(see Section 2 below) and the x′ = constant projection of TD (see Section 3 below) are not
the only physically distinct space-time measurements possible within Special Relativity.
In fact, as will be demonstrated below, there are two others: Space Dilatation (SD), the
t′ = constant projection and Time Contraction (TC), the x = constant projection. All
four ‘eﬀects’ are pure consequences of the LT. The additional eﬀects of Optical Aberration
and Light Propagation Delays on the appearance of moving objects and synchronised
clocks have been extensively discussed elsewhere [6].

Although each of the four eﬀects may be simply derived from the projective geometry
of the space time LT, the LFC and TD give rise to more easily observable physical eﬀects,
so it is not surprising that they are better known, For example the LFC is essential for
the physical interpretation of the Michelson-Morley experiment, and TD is necessary to
describe the observed lifetimes of unstable particles decaying in ﬂight. In contrast, the
two new eﬀects SD and TC seem to have no similar simple observational consequences.
As pointed out below, the most interesting eﬀects are likely to result from SD, which
is necessary to describe observations of, for example, a rotating extended object moving
with a relativistic transverse velocity. It is easy to conceive a simple experiment involving
the observation of two synchronised clocks in space, to test the TC eﬀect. Although it
is clearly of interest to work out in more detail such examples, there is no attempt to
do so in the present paper, which is devoted to the precise deﬁnition of the four possible
space-time projections of the LT and a discussion of their interrelations.

The t = constant projection of the LFC is the space-time measurement appropriate
to the ‘moving bodies’ of Einstein’s original paper and to the photographic recording
technique. This medium has no intrinsic time resolution and relies on that provided by
a rapidly moving shutter to provide a clear image. The LFC ‘works’ as a well deﬁned
physical phenomenon because the ‘measuring rod’ or other physical object under obser-
vation is assumed to be illuminated during the whole time interval required to make an
observation, and so constitutes a continuous source of emitted or reﬂected photons, such
that some are always available in the diﬀerent space (∆x′) and time (∆t′) intervals in S’
for every position of the rod corresponding to the time interval ∆t = τR around the ﬁxed
time t in the observer’s frame S during which the observation is made. If, however, the
physical object of interest has internal motion (rotation, expansion or contraction) or is
only illuminated, in its rest frame S’, during a short time interval, the above conditions,
that assure that the t = constant projection gives a well deﬁned space-time measurement
no longer apply. All such objects, uniformly illuminated for a restricted time τL (their ‘Lu-
minous Proper Time’) in their rest frames, may be called ‘Transient Luminous Objects’.
For such objects it is natural to deﬁne a length measurement by taking the t′ = constant
projection in S’. The observation, from the stationary frame S, of such objects is discussed
in Section 2 below.

In Section 3 time measurements other than the conventional TD of Special Relativity
are considered. The TD phenomenon refers only to a local clock, in the sense that its
position in the frame S’ is invariant (say at the spatial origin of coordinates x′ = 0).
However, the time recorded by any synchronised clock in the same inertial frame is,
by deﬁnition, identical. Einstein used such an array of ‘equivalent clocks’ situated at
diﬀerent positions in the same inertial frame in his original discussion of the relativity

2

of simultanaeity [1]. The question addressed in Section 3 is: What will an observer in
S see if he looks not only at a given local clock in S’, but also at other, synchronised,
equivalent clocks at diﬀerent positions in S’, in comparison to a standard clock at rest in
his own frame? It is shown that such equivalent clocks may be seen to run slower than,
or faster than, the TD prediction for a local clock. In particular they may even appear
to run faster than the standard clock. This is an example of the Time Contraction eﬀect
mentioned above.

In Section 4 the analogy between the Lorentz-Fitzgerald Contraction eﬀect and linear
perspective in two spatial dimensions is described. The ﬁnal Section points out how all
four space-time ‘eﬀects’ (observed distortions of space-time) in Special Relativity may be
described in a uniﬁed way in terms of projective geometry, in close analogy with the eﬀect
of linear perspective in the perception of space.

2 Observation of Transient Luminous Objects in Mo-

tion: the Space Dilatation Eﬀect

Consider a square planar object centered at the origin of the moving frame S’ as
shown in Fig 1a. The points P’(x′ = −L/2, y ′ = 0) and Q’(x′ = L/2, y ′ = 0) lie on the
vertical edges of the square of side L whose boundary is shown in Fig 1a as the short
dashed lines. Suppose now that the square is uniformly illuminated in the time interval
−τL/2 < t′ < τL/2 to give the ‘Transient Luminous Object’ indicted by the zig-zag lines.
The proper time interval τL is the ‘Luminous Proper Time’ of the object. For example,
the surface of the square may be covered with a mosaic of light-emitting diodes that are
simultaneously switched on during a time τL. The object as seen by an observer, at rest
in the stationary system S, viewing the object in a direction perpendicular to the plane
O′x′y ′, is given by the LT connecting space time points in the frame S’ to those in S:

x = γ(x′ + vt′)
x′
c

t = γ(t′ + β

)

(2.1)

(2.2)

.

where

β ≡ v/c,

γ ≡

1

√1 − β2

It is assumed that the stationary observer is suﬃciently distant from the object that the
eﬀects of light propagation times are negligible, and that the object is diﬀusely illuminated
so that Optical Aberration eﬀects may be neglected [6]. In this case any changes in the
appearance of the moving object when viewed from the frame S are due solely to the LT.
The results of the transformation for t′ = 0 and x′ = −L/2, 0, L/2 are given in Table 1. It
can be seen that the points P’,O’,Q’ are observed at diﬀerent times in the frame S. This
is the well known eﬀect of the relativity of simultanaeity ﬁrst pointed out in Einstein’s
classic paper [1]. It can also be seen from Table 1 that the distance between the positions
of P’ and Q’ as observed in S is γL; that is, the object will appear to be elongated if it
is viewed with a time resolution larger than the diﬀerence in time, γβL/c, between the

the objects are shown as short dashed lines. The long dashed rectangle of width γL in b)
shows the outline of the object when viewed with coarse time resolution: τR ≫ γβL/c.
The observer in S is assumed to be suﬃciently distant from the object that the eﬀects
of light propagation delays may be neglected. The object is also assumed to constitute a
diﬀuse photon source so that Optical Aberration eﬀects are negligible.

observations in S of the space time points P’ and Q’ that are simultaneous in the frame
S’. This is the ‘Space Dilatation’ (SD) eﬀect. It will now be discussed in more detail,
taking into account the non zero Luminous Proper Time τL of the Transient Luminous
Object as well as the Resolution Time τR of the observer, so that the general conditions
under which the SD eﬀect occurs are established.

Space time points of the Transient Luminous Object may be observed at the ﬁxed

time t in S provided that:

x′
M IN < x′ < x′

M AX

where

t = γ(−

τL

(2.3)

In (2.3) it is assumed that x′
M AX < L/2. The general condition relating
τL,L, v and c ensuring the validity of this assumption will be discussed below. Using (2.1)
the co-ordinates in S corresponding to x′

M IN > −L/2, x′

M IN and x′

M AX are found to be:

xM AX =

xM IN =

c
β

)

(2.4)

(2.5)

Thus the width δ of the Transient Luminous Object observed at time t in S (indicated by
the zig-zag lines in Fig1b; the actual boundary is shown by the short dashed lines) is:

δ ≡ xM AX − xM IN =

cτL
βγ

,

(2.6)

while, as can be seen from (2.4) and (2.5), the observer in S sees a luminous object
that moves with velocity c/β, i.e.
faster than than the velocity of light. In the case of
continous illumination of the object (τL → ∞) the upper and lower limits of the object
M IN = −L/2,
observed at the ﬁxed time t in S will correspond to the physical boundaries x′
x′
M AX the times in S’ corresponding to the observation
M AX = L/2. Denoting by t′
of these boundaries at time t in S, then, instead of (2.3), the following relation is obtained:

M IN , t′

t = γ(t′

M IN +

Using (2.1), the boundaries of the object observed in S at time t are then:

xM AX =

L

xM IN = −

L

(2.7)

(2.8)

(2.9)

The width of the object as seen in S is then xM AX − xM IN = L/γ, the well known LFC
eﬀect. As can be seen from (2.8) and (2.9) the object is now observed to move in S with
velocity v. Thus, in the limit τL → ∞ (continous illumination of the object) the usual
results of Special Relativity are recovered.

Using (2.1) and (2.2) the upper (U) and lower (L) limits of the space time region in
the stationary frame S swept out by the moving Transient Luminous Object in Fig 1b

Taking account of the inequality:

βL

,

it can be seen that if τL ≪ βL/c the terms containing τL in (2.10)-(2.13) may be neglected,
so that:

xU − xL ≃ γL
γβL
tU − tL ≃

c

(2.14)

(2.15)

Thus the Space Dilatation eﬀect of Table 1 is recovered in the limit τL → 0. On the other
hand, because of the inequality:

vτL <

cτL
β

,

then, if τL ≫ L/v, the terms containing L in (2.10)-(2.13) may be neglected, leading to
the relations:

xU − xL ≃ γvτL
tU − tL ≃ γτL.

(2.16)
(2.17)

These are the well-known equations of Special Relativity describing the motion of a
small continously illuminated object as observed in the frame S. The time interval tU − tL
corresponds to the TD eﬀect and the observed velocity is:

(xU − xL)/(tU − tL) = γvτL/γτL = v.

(2.18)

The conclusions of this Section are now summarised. When τL ≪ βL/c a stationary
observer in S with a time resolution τR ≪ γβL/c, viewing the object in the direction

6

transverse to the relative velocity, sees the square object at rest in S’ illuminated during
the proper time interval τL as a narrow rectangular object of width δ = cτL/(βγ) moving
with velocity c/β and sweeping out during the time γβL/c a region of total length γL.
If however the resolution time τR of the observer is much larger than γβL/c the object
will appear at rest but elongated by the factor γ in the direction of motion. This is the
Space Dilatation eﬀect. In the contrary case that the Luminous Proper Time τL is large
(τL ≫ L/v), the object observed from S moves with velocity v and has an apparent length
L/γ due to the well known LFC eﬀect. Also, in this case, the elapsed times in S and S’
are related by the TD eﬀect (Eqn. 2.17).

It should be noted that the ‘narrow rectangular object’ referred to above corresponds
to the case of uniform illumination of the square object. Actually, because of the relativity
of simultaneity, diﬀerent parts of the square are seen at diﬀerent times and positions by
the stationary observer. If the square were illuminated using diﬀerent colours: red, yellow,
green, blue in four equal bands parallel to the y ′ axis, in the direction of increasing x′,
then the moving object in Fig 1b would appear red during the time interval −γβL/2c <
t < γβL/4c, yellow during the time −γβL/4c < t < 0, and so on. The colours will, of
course, be seen shifted in frequency according to the relativistic transverse Doppler eﬀet.

If the square is rotated about the y ′ axis by an angle α, a subtle interplay occurs
between the eﬀects of the LT and light propagation time delays. Depending on the values
of v and α the rectangular object may be seen, by an observer at rest in the frame S, to
move parallel to ~v (as in the case α = 0 described above), antiparallel to ~v, or may even
even be stationary and of length γL cos α. In all cases the total length swept out by the
object in the direction of motion is γL cos α. These eﬀects have been described in detail
elsewhere [6].

3 Observation of an Array of Equivalent Moving Clocks:

The Time Contraction Eﬀect

In this Section space time measurements of an array of synchronised clocks situated
in the inertial frame S’ will be considered. These clocks may be synchronised by any
convenient procedure [7] (see for example Ref.[1]). For an observer in S’ all such clocks
are ‘equivalent’ in the sense that each of them records, independently of its position, the
proper time τ ′ of the frame S’. For convenience, the array of clocks is assumed to be
placed on the wagons of a train which is at rest in S’, as shown in Fig.2a. The clocks are
labelled Cm , m = ... − 2, −1, 0, 1, 2, ... and are situated (with the exception of the ‘magic
clock’ CM , see below) at ﬁxed distances L from each other, along the Ox’ axis, which is
parallel to the train. It is assumed that the observers in the frames S and S’ view the
train transversely at a suﬃciently large distance that the eﬀects of light propagation time
delays may be neglected. It is clear that by considering the limit L → 0 an Equivalent
Clock may be associated with each position on the train and, by extending the ‘lattice’
of clocks to 3 dimensions, to any spatial position in S’.

The observer in S’ will note that each Equivalent Clock (EC) indicates the same time,
as shown in Fig.2a. It is now asked how the array of EC will appear to an observer at

a ﬁxed position in the frame S when the train is moving with velocity βc parallel to the
direction Ox in S (Fig.2b). It is assumed that the EC C0 is placed at x′ = 0 and that it
is synchronised with the Standard Clock CS, placed at x = 0 in S, when t = t′ = 0. All
the clocks are similar, that is CS and each Cm record exactly equal time intervals when
they are situated in the same inertial frame.

The appearence of the moving array of EC to an observer in S at t = 0 is shown in
Fig.2b, and in more detail in Fig.3 for both t = 0 and t = τ . The period τ is the time
between the passage of successive EC past CS. The big hand of CS in Fig.3 rotates through
180◦ during the time τ . Explicit expressions for the observed times are presented in Table
2. In Fig.2b,3 the times indicated by the clocks are shown for β = 0.6. These times are
readily calculated using the LT equations (2.1),(2.2). Consider the time indicated by C1
at t = 0. The space-time points are:

Hence, Eqns.(2.1),(2.2) give:

As shown in Fig 2b, the wagons of the train appear shorter due to the LFC eﬀect
(Eqn.(3.4)) and also the wagons at the front end of the train are seen at an earlier proper
time than those at the rear end. Thus a t = 0 snapshot in S corresponds, not to a
ﬁxed t′ in S’ but one which depends on x′: t′ = −βx′/c. This is a consequence of the
relativity of simultaneity of space-time events in S and S’, as ﬁrst pointed out by Einstein
in Ref.[1]. Here it appears in a particularly graphic and striking form. Consider now the
time indicated by C−1 at t = τ , i.e. when C−1 is at the origin of S. The space-time points
are:

S ′

: (−L, t′) ; S : (0, τ )

(3.9)

The EC at the origin of S at t = τ shows a later time than CS i.e. it is apparently running
faster than CS. This is an example of Time Contraction (TC). The Time Contraction
eﬀect is exhibited by the EC observed at any ﬁxed position in S. In fact, if the observer
in S can see the EC only when they are near to CS he (or she) will inevitably conclude
that the clocks on the train run fast, not slow as in the classical TD eﬀect (see below).
Suppose that the observer is sitting in a waiting room with the clock CS and notices the
time on the train (the same as CS) by looking at C0 as it passes the waiting room window.
If he (or she) then compares C−1 as it passes the window with CS it will be seen to be
running fast relative to the latter. In order to see the TD eﬀect the observer would (as
will now be shown), have to note the time shown by, for example, C0, at time t = τ as
recorded by CS in comparison with that shown by the same clock C0 at t = 0. Using
Eqn.(3.8),Eqn.(3.3) may be written as [C1(t = 0)]:

t′ = −β2γτ = −

(γ2 − 1)τ

γ

(3.10)

This is the formula for the observed time reported in Table 2. Now consider C0 at time
t = τ . The space-time points are:

Hence, Eqns.(2.1),(2.2) give:

S ′

: (0, t′) ; S : (x, τ )

with the solutions [ C0(t = τ ) ]:

x = γvt′
τ = γt′

t′ = τ /γ
x = vτ = L/γ

(3.11)
(3.12)

(3.13)
(3.14)

So the EC C0 at time t = τ indicates an earlier time, and so is apparently running slower
than CS. This is the classical Time Dilatation (TD) eﬀect. It applies to observations of
all local clocks in S’,(i.e. those situated at a ﬁxed value of x′) as well as any other EC
that has the same value of x′.

11

As a last example consider the ‘Magic Clock’ CM shown in Fig 2a at time t = τ . With

the space-time points:

Eqns.(2.1),(2.2) give:

S ′

: (−L/(1 + γ), t′) ; S : (x, τ )

x = γ[−L/(1 + γ) + vt′]
τ = γ[t′ −
L/(1 + γ)]

β
c

with the solutions [ CM (t = τ ) ]:

t′ = τ
x = γvτ /(1 + γ)

(3.15)

(3.16)

(3.17)
(3.18)

where the relation L = γvτ from Eqn.(3.8) has been used. Thus CM shows the same time
as CS at t = τ . Similar moving ‘Magic Clocks’ can be deﬁned that show the same time as
CS at any chosen time t in S. Such a clock is, in general, situated at x′ = −ct(γ − 1)/βγ.
All of the other clock times presented in Table 2 and shown in Figs. 2b, 3 are calculated
in a similar way to the above examples by choosing appropriate values of x′ and t.

The combined eﬀects of the LT and light propagation delays for light signals moving
parallel to the train (corresponding to observations of the array of Equivalent Clocks

by observers on, or close to the train) have been described in detail elsewhere [6]. The
observed spatial distortions of the train in this situation were previously considered by
Weinstein [5].

4 Analogy with Linear Perspective in Two Dimen-

sional Space

The analogy between the observed distortions of space-time in Special Relativity and
linear spatial perspective is illustrated in Fig.4. The ‘Object Space’ on the right is sepa-
rated from the ‘Image Space’ on the left by a plane partition containing a small aperture
(pin hole). Light reﬂected from the rod PQ in the Object Space, can pass through the
pin hole and produce an image on a screen located in the Image Space. To facilitate the
comparison with the Lorentz Transformation the cartesian axes in the Object [Image]
space are denoted by (X’,T’) [ (X,T)] respectively (see Fig. 4). The T, T’ axes are per-
pendicular to the plane of the partition and pass through the pin hole. The Object Space
is now compared to the rest frame S’ of the moving object, with the correspondences:

X ′ ⇔ x′,

T ′ ⇔ t′,

while the Image Space is compared to the frame S of the stationary observer with the
correspondences:

X ⇔ x,

T ⇔ t,

5 Discussion

The diﬀerent space-time eﬀects (observed distortions of space or time) in Special Rel-
ativity that have been discussed above are summarised in Table 3. These are the well-
known LFC and TD eﬀects, Space Dilatation (SD) introduced in Section 2 above, and
Time Contraction (TC) introduced in Section 3. Each eﬀect is an observed diﬀerence ∆q
(q = x, x′, t, t′) of two space or time coordinates (∆q = q1 − q2) and corresponds to a
constant projection ˜q = constant, i.e. ∆˜q = 0 (˜q 6= q), in another of the four variables
x, x′, t, t′ of the LT. As shown in Table 3, the LFC, SD, TC and TD eﬀects correspond,
respectively, to constant t, t′, x and x′ projections. After making this projection, the
four LT equations give two relations among the remaining three variables. One of these
describes the ‘space-time distortion’ relating ∆t′ and ∆t or ∆x′ and ∆x while the other
gives the equation shown in the last column, (labelled ‘Complementary Eﬀect’) in Table
3. These equations relate either ∆x to ∆t (for SD and TD) or ∆x′ to ∆t′ (for LFC and
TC). It can be seen from the Complementary Eﬀect relations that the two space-time
points deﬁning the eﬀect (of space-time distortion) are space-like separated for LFC and
SD and time-like separated for TC and TD.

For example, for the LFC when t1 = t2 = t, the LT equations for the two space-time

points are:

x′
1 = γ(x1 − vt)
x′
2 = γ(x2 − vt)

Subtracting (5.1) from (5.2) and (5.3) from (5.4) gives:

(5.6)

Eqn.(5.5) describes the LFC eﬀect, while combining Eqns.(5.5) and (5.6) to eliminate ∆x
yields the equation for the Complementary Eﬀect. By taking other projections the other
entries of Table 3 may be calculated in a similar fashion. It is interesting to note that the
TD eﬀect can be derived directly from the LFC eﬀect by using the symmetry of the LT
equations. Introducing the notation: s ≡ ct, the LT may be written as:

x′ = γ(x − βs)
s′ = γ(s − βx)

These equations are invariant [8] under the following transformations:

T 1
T 2

: x ↔ s,
: x ↔ x′,

x′ ↔ s′
s ↔ s′,

β → −β

(5.7)
(5.8)

(5.9)

Writing out the LFC entries in the ﬁrst row of Table 3, replacing t, t′ by s/c, s′/c ; gives

∆x ∆s = 0 ∆x =

∆x′ = −

Applying T 1 to each entry in this row results in:

Applying T 2:

∆s′ = −

∆x′

∆s′ ∆x′ = 0 ∆s′ =

∆s =

Replacing ∆s, ∆s′ by c∆t, c∆t′ yields the last row of Table 3 which describes the TD
eﬀect. Similarly TC can be derived from SD (or vice versa) by successively applying the
transformations T 1, T 2.

The ‘Complementary Eﬀects’ listed in Table 3 have the following geometrical inter-

pretations:

• LFC (∆x′ = −(c/β)∆t′). This is the locus of all the points in S’ that are observed

at the same time (∆t = 0) in S.

• SD (∆x = (c/β)∆t). The locus of the moving object as observed in S (see Fig1b).
• TC (∆x′ = −cβ∆t′). The locus of the position of the local clock in S’ observed at

a ﬁxed position (∆x = 0) in S.

• TD (∆x = cβ∆t). The locus of the position of the moving local clock observed in

S.

A remark on the ‘Observed Quantities’ in Table 3. For the LFC, SD eﬀects the
observed quantity is a length interval in the frame S. The observed space distortion occurs
because this length diﬀers from the result of of a similar measurement made on the same
object in its own rest frame. ∆x′ is not directly measured at the time of observation
of the LFC or SD. It is otherwise with the time measurements TD, TC. Here the time
intervals indicated in their own rest frame by a local moving clock (TD), or diﬀerent
equivalent clocks at the same position in S (TC), are supposed to be directly observed
and compared with the time interval ∆t registered by an unmoving clock in the observer’s
rest frame. Thus the eﬀect refers to two simultaneous observations by the same observer
not to separate observations by two diﬀerent observers as in the case of the LFC and SD.

Einstein’s ﬁrst paper on Special Relativity [1] showed, for the ﬁrst time, that the LFC
and TD eﬀects could be most simply understood in terms of the geometry of space time,
in contrast to the previous works of Fitzgerald, Larmor, Lorentz and Poincar´e where dy-
namical and kinematical considerations were always mixed [9]. However it can also be
argued that Special Relativity has a dynamical aspect due to the changes in the electro-
magnetic ﬁeld induced by the LT. Indeed, by calculations of the equilibrium positions of
an array of point charges in both stationary and uniformly moving frames Sorensen has
shown that the LFC may be derived from dynamical considerations [10]. By considering
several diﬀerent ‘electromagnetic clocks’ either at rest or in uniform motion, Jeﬁmenko
has demonstrated that the TD eﬀect may also be dynamically derived [11]. Similar con-
siderations, emphasising the ‘dynamical’ rather than the ‘kinematical’ aspects of Special
Relativity, have been presented in an article by Bell [12]. Such calculations, based on the

properties of electromagnetic ﬁelds under the LT, demonstrate the consistency of Clas-
sical Electromagnetism with Special Relativity, but as pointed out by Bell [12], in no
way supersede the simpler geometrical derivations of the eﬀects. It is not evident to the
present author how similar ‘dynamical’ derivations of the new SD and TC eﬀects could
be performed.

In conclusion the essential characteristics of the two ‘new’ space-time distortions dis-

cussed above are summarised :

• Space Dilatation (SD): If a luminous object lying along the Ox’ axis, at rest in
the frame S’, is uniformly illuminated for a short time τL in this frame it will be
observed from a frame S, in uniform motion relative to S’ parallel to Ox’ at the
velocity -βc, in a direction perpendicular to the relative velocity, as a narrow strip
of width cτL/(βγ), perpendicular to the x-axis, moving with the velocity c/β in the
same direction as the object. The total distance swept out along the x-axis by the

is the length along Ox’ of the object as observed in S’. Thus the apparent length of

strip during the time βL/(c√1 − β2), for which it is visible, is L/√1 − β2 where L
the object when viewed with a time resolution τR much larger than βL/(c√1 − β2)
is L/√1 − β2.
• Time Contraction (TC): The equivalent clocks in the moving frame S’, viewed at
the same position in the stationary frame S, apparently run faster by a factor
1/√1 − β2 relative to a clock at rest in S.

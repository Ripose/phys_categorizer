What really are the best 100m performances?

J. R. Mureika
Department of Computer Science
University of Southern California
Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA

The title of the “Fastest Man in the World” has always resided in the
domain of the 100m champion. There is perhaps no greater test of strength,
power, and agility for a human being. In late July 1997, this title returned
to its home in Canada as our own Donovan Bailey crossed the ﬁnish line in
a remarkable 9.84s, even after a relatively slow reaction time of 0.174s and a
small tail wind of +0.7 m/s. His incredible top speed of 12.1 m/s is further
support to his claim on the title.

However, this race was run with a non–zero tail wind. That is, Bailey
had an advantage not over his competitors, but over 100m times from other
races. While the legal wind speed limit is +2.0 m/s for the 100m and 200m
sprints, one can never discount the fact that a race run with a +1.9 m/s
tail wind has an implicit advantage over a race run with a 0.0 m/s tailwind,
or even a headwind, for that matter. Despite these rules, is it possible to
compare all 100m races on a more or less equal footing?

The answer, to a degree, is “yes”, and results from a little application
of the physics of ﬂuid mechanics. A runner moving through a wind with an
arbitrary velocity experiences either a resistive or propulsive force, as well
as a drag eﬀect. The former are the result of Newtonian mechanics (force
laws), and the drag depends on such factors as the runner’s mass, speed,
cross–sectional area, and density of surrounding air.

It was determined that a sprinter loses bewtween 3–6% of his/her energy
in overcoming the drag. A simple formula to compensate for accompany-
ing wind speeds was derived to calculate the equivalent still–air (zero wind
speed) race times; for the conservative limit of 3%, this is

t0 ≈

1.03 − 0.03 ×

× tW ,

where tW is the recorded race time, W is the wind speed, and t0 is the
equivalent still–air time. You can do it with your own race times!

So, how would the record books look if this formula was a standard ap-
plication to world class performances? Adjustments of various sets of 100m
times (denoted by t0 and tW , respectively) are shown in the accompanying

1

tables. For sheer comparison, Ben Johnson’s disqualiﬁed WR performances
of 1987 and 1988 are included.

1 World Rankings

One of the mose fascinating results can be found in Table 2, the wind–
corrected performances. Donovan Bailey’s 9.84s WR adjusts to a 9.88s
equivalent in calm air. Meanwhile, Frank Fredricks’ 9.86s clocking (Lau-
sanne, 03 Jul 1996) was run with a wind reading of −0.4 m/s, which after
correction surpasses Bailey’s WR performance by 0.04s! It is certainly con-
ceivable that, given the proper conditions, Fredricks could have claimed the
elusive title of “World’s Fastest Man” with this race. In fact, if Fredricks
had given this same performance in Atlanta (i.e. with a wind speed of +0.7
m/s), he would have crossed the line in roughly 9.81s!

It should be noted that, due to the drag eﬀects mentioned earlier, races
run into a head wind will have faster corresponding times than races run
with a tail wind of equivalent strength. Figure 1 shows that the “correction
curve” is not linear, but rather a curve bending toward the right. Hence, a
head wind will fall on the “steeper” portion of the curve, while a tail wind
will be on the shallower side.

The 9.84s WR would rank 6th all–time if we included banned perfor-
mances (Table 3). After correcting for the wind conditions, (Table 4),
this time climbs to 5th, but is surpassed by several diﬀerent performances.
Thompson’s 9.69s run has a wind–corrected equivalent of 9.93s, and has sunk
to 16th. Meanwhile, Davidson Ezinwa’s 9.91s race (into a 2.3 m/s headwind)
has a wind–corrected 9.76s equivalent. Note that this performance is marked
with a “d”, indicating a doubtful wind reading1.

Florence Griﬃth–Joyner’s 100m WR performance of 10.49s at the 1988
It has been noted that, at the time of
US Olympic Trials is skeptical.
this race (second heat of the second round), the wind gauge for the 100m
straight read a speed of +0.0 m/s, whereas a nearby gauge (for the jumps
runway) read speeds in excess of +4.0 m/s. Furthermore, the wind reading
for the third heat was +5.0 m/s. This mysterious sudden calm was never
really addressed; it is unreasonable to assume that the wind would die down
1It is generally known that athletes who race at altitude perform better than they do
closer to sea level, and it has been suggested that this eﬀect may be more physiological
in nature than physical, since the corresponding change in air density does not yield the
expected change in race time.

completely for the duration of one race. So, assuming that the wind speed
was actually between +4.0 m/s and +5.0 m/s during Flo–Jo’s “WR” race,
she would have actually clocked a time somewhere in the range of 10.70s –
10.74s for a still wind, which would be much more consistent with her other
performances (her time of 10.61s in the ﬁnal was legal, however, with a wind
speed of +1.2 m/s).

2 Canadian Rankings

This analysis also shows some neat results of local interest. For example,
Bailey’s 9.84s WR from Atlanta rounds to a 9.88s still–air equivalent. Fur-
thermore, if the correction formula (1) is applied to Bailey’s Atlanta splits2,
these times could be compared with indoor performances (where there is no
wind speed) over the same distance. In this case, one ﬁnds 50m and 60m
times of 5.63s and 6.53s, respectively. The former (5.63s) is only 0.07s slower
than his 50m 5.56s indoor WR (Reno, NV, 09 Feb 1996), a diﬀerence which
could perhaps be accounted for by reaction time; i.e. if Bailey had a reac-
tion time of around 0.11–0.12s for his 50m WR, then these results would
be consistent. The latter (6.53s) is 0.02s oﬀ his 1997 indoor PB of 6.51s
(Maebashi, Japan, 08 Feb 1997). This would tend to suggest that Bailey’s
Olympic 100m WR was consistent with his other PB performances.

The 1996 100m rankings can be similarly restructured. Table 8 shows
the top 46 performances, accounting for wind assistance, and Tables 6,7
show the top 10 legal and wind–corrected rankings. The Canadian rankings
do not suﬀer as much of a restructuring as do the World rankings.

3 Conclusions

Who, then, did run the fastest 100m race ever? Based on this model, and
discounting substance–assisted performances, doubtful wind readings, and
hand–times, Fredricks comes out the winner, and Bailey has to settle for
2nd. Only 3 of the top 20 performances are now sub–9.90, whereas before
8 out of 20 were under this mark. The third fastest wind–corrected time is
Christie’s; it would have been interesting had he not false–started out of the
ﬁnal in Atlanta. Only about 7 of the top 20 wind–corrected athletes will be
2The formula has to be modiﬁed for the distance, though; the ’100’ in the numerator
changes to 50 and 60 to correspond to the race distance. Although, it doesn’t make much
of a diﬀerence to leave it as 100.

competing this year (who knows if Christie will be back with a vengeance?).
We’ll most likely see the most sub–9.90s races to date. Most importantly,
though, Fredricks has the real potential to better Bailey’s existing record.
Of course, Bailey will also have the same potential. It seems quite likely that
the 100m WR drop from its 1996 mark. Will we see a sub–9.80s race? If so,
who will be the one to run it? Based on their best races last year, Bailey
could run a 9.79s with a +1.7m/s tailwind, while Fredricks would need a
mere +1.0m/s! With more training under their belt, who knows what to
expect. Watch for a showdown between these two at the 1997 WC!

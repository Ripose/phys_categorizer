Aging Random Walks

Stefan Boettcher1,2

February 9, 2008

Aging refers to the property of two-time correlation functions to decay very slowly

on (at least) two time scales. This phenomenon has gained recent attention due to

experimental observations of the history dependent relaxation behavior in amorphous

materials (“Glasses”) which pose a challenge to theorist. Aging signals the breaking of

time-translational invariance and the violation of the ﬂuctuation dissipation theorem

during the relaxation process. But while the origin of aging in disordered media

is profound, and the discussion is clad in the language of a well-developed theory,

systems as simple as a random walk near a wall can exhibit aging. Such a simple

walk serves well to illustrate the phenomenon and some of the physics behind it.

I. INTRODUCTION

Aging is an important phenomenon observed experimentally in glassy materials where

relaxation behavior depends on the previous history of the system [1]. As a model for a glass

Edwards and Anderson [2] introduced an Ising system where the uniform coupling J > 0

between neighboring spins is replace by random numbers Ji,j, drawn from some distribution,

which are placed on each bond. The properties of such a disordered system are quite diﬀerent

1

when the couplings are drawn from, say, a gaussian distribution with zero mean, compared

to those of the ferro-magnetic Ising model with uniform couplings J > 0: While (for d

2)

≥

the uniform Ising model reaches an ordered phase below a critical temperature Tc with

a nonzero spontaneous magnetization as order parameter, no such order emerges in the

random bond model. Yet, below a certain temperature Tg, the “glass transition,” more and

more spins loose their mobility and freeze into place, but without any collectively preferred

direction. Thus, while no macroscopic order parameter emerges, microscopically the state

of the system is ultimately highly (auto-)correlated. The relaxation process towards such

a state is naturally extremely slow due to the inherent frustration created by the bond

distribution, and each spin has to “negotiate” its orientation with ever distant neighbors to

further lower the collective energy within their domain.

Consider such a spin glass quenched below the glass transition Tg at time (“age”) ta = 0

in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld. Throughout the sample, domains of various pure states

develop that grow with characteristic size L(ta) [3]. After waiting a time ta = tw, the mag-

netic ﬁeld is turned oﬀ and the system’s response in the form of its remnant magnetization

is measured. Initially, the response function is only sensitive to the pure, quasi-equilibrium

states in their distinct domains. But after an additional time scale related to the waiting

time, tw, the response spans entire domains and slows down when it experiences the oﬀ-

equilibrium state the sample possesses as a whole. In either regime, though, the remnant

magnetization decays very slowly, similar to the sequence of graphs (see Ref. [1]) in Fig. 2

below. It has been suggested [4] that a simple scaling form might hold for glasses; e.g. that

the autocorrelation function for the remnant magnetization at the age ta = t + tw of the

experiment is given by

C(t + tw, tw) = t−

µf (t/tw)

,

(1.1)

where the scaling function f is constant for small argument, and falls either like a power

law (indication of a single aging time scale) or like a stretched exponential (indication of

multiple aging time scales [5]) for large argument. In any case, time-translational invariance

2

in this two-time correlation function C is broken due to the fact that the relaxation process

becomes dependent on its previous history in form of the waiting time tw.

Similar quantities have been observed in a variety of phenomenological [6] and theoretical

[7–10] model systems as well, and a debate is raging on the ingredients that are required

for a model to capture the salient features of glassy materials [11]. While (as we will see)

it is easy to produce aging behavior, the more intricate results from temperature cycling

experiments [12] are much harder to reproduce, and appear to be a much more stringent

indicator of the complicated phase-space structure (dubbed “rugged landscapes” [13]) real

glasses possess.

In fact, a simple random walk near a (reﬂecting or absorbing) wall is well suited to

describe the domain-growth picture used above to describe the observed aging behavior.

Consider a walker starting near the wall n = 0 at ta = 0. After a waiting time ta = tw

she has explored a domain of size L(tw)

t1/2
w oﬀ the wall. The walk now represents the

∼

correlation function for a spin at site n in the above spin glass model, and the wall is the

edge of the (albeit one-sided) domain. In place of magnetization, we measure the probability

n, tw) for the walker to return to the same site n she found herself on at time tw.

P (n, t + tw|
Without the wall, P is of course invariant to shifts in space and time, i. e. tw is irrelevant and

no aging behavior can be expected. In the presense of the wall, the walker will venture from

the site n for small times t after tw and ﬁnd herself unconstraint (the “quasi-equilibrium”

state), but when t

tw she is likely to encounter the wall and carry a memory of that

constraint back to the site n for t

tw.

In the next section, we will solve this model

for a suitably deﬁned two-time correlation function which indeed shows the expected aging

∼

≫

behavior.

Of course, in this model it is the wall that explicitly breaks the symmetries of the system

instead of the dynamics of the process, and the observed aging behavior appears trivial.

On the other hand, the dynamics of the stochastic annihilation process A + A

0, which

→

is similar to a walk at a wall, yields identical results to those reported below [14], and

the distinction between explicit and dynamical symmetry breaking is not so clear anymore.

3

Finally, the case of an absorbing wall is particularly revealing and illustrates the the eﬀect

of a process that is slowly dying out (i. e. its norm decays), while true aging should only be

associated with intrinsic properties of a process that will sustain itself. This point has lead

to some confusion recently.

II. THE RANDOM WALK MODEL

In this section, we will calculate the conditional probability P (n, t
|

n0, t0) for a walker

to reach a site n at time t, given that she was at site n0 at some previous time t0 < t in

the presense of either an absorbing or a reﬂecting wall. Then, we will compute a simple

two-time correlation function (see e. g. Ref. [7] for a similar deﬁnition)

C(t + tw, tw) =

P (n, t + tw|

n, tw)P (n, tw|

0, 0)

n
X

(2.1)

for a walker to return to a site at time ta = t + tw, given that she was at the same site at

time tw after the start of the walk at time ta = 0 near the wall n = 0. For both boundary

conditions, we ﬁnd that the walk ages, i. e. shows a scaling behavior according to Eq. (1.1).

Note that the breaking of spatial invariance in P due to the wall is crucial for the breaking of

time-translational invariance in C: For an unconstraint walk P would be invariant in space

and time, and we would ﬁnd P (n, t + tw|
it is C(t + tw, tw) = C(t, 0) = P (0, t
|

n, tw) = P (0, t
|

0, 0), and with

n P (n, tw|

0, 0)

≡

0, 0), independent of tw. In the presense of the wall,

spatial invariance is broken while time invariance for P still holds, and C merely simpliﬁes

to C(t + tw, tw) =

n P (n, t
|

n, 0)P (n, tw|

0, 0) which remains a function of tw.

To simplify the algebra, we consider instead of the walk equation for P the potential

(r > 0, t > 0),

φ(r, 0) = δ(r

or

(2.2)

where the two boundary conditions in the last line correspond to an absorbing and a reﬂecting

wall, respectively [15]. We solve for φ, and identify P (n, t

C(t + tw, tw) =

The Eq. (2.2) is easy to solve by converting to an ordinary diﬀerential equation (ODE)

in r using a Laplace transform in t: ˜φ(r, s) =

st φ(r, s). The ODE has simple

exponential solutions in two regions, 0 < r < r0 and r > r0, whose four unknown constants

are determined by the two boundary conditions at r = 0 and r =

, and by the two

In each case, the upper sign refers to reﬂecting boundary conditions, and the lower sign

A. Reﬂecting Boundary Conditions

Eq. (2.3) and choose r0 = 0 for convenience [17]:

B. Absorbing Boundary Conditions

Again, we insert the appropriate forms of φ in Eq. (2.5), using the lower sign case, into

Eq. (2.3). But with absorbing boundary conditions, putting the starting position at r0 = 0

would be instantly fatal for the walker. (In simulations we use n = 1 as starting point.)

Instead, we can choose r0 arbitrarily small and expand to leading order. Since the starting

point r0 is irrelevant for the asymptotic behavior (at large times) considered here [17], we

can be sure that higher-order corrections in r0 will have to be subdominant:

In this case, we ﬁnd more interesting scaling behavior with f (x

But this observed aging behavior does not consider the eﬀect that a walk actually dis-

appears when reaching the wall which diminishes the norm of the distribution (φ or P ).

Rather, to obtain the intrinsic properties of an inﬁnite walk near an absorbing wall, we

have to properly normalize the correlation function. To that end, we consider the two-time

correlation function C(t + tw, tw|
actly at time ta = θ, and its generic relation to the intrinsic two-time correlation function

θ) for a walk that reaches the wall (and disappears) ex-

These quantities are related to the two-time correlation function given in Eq. (2.7) (which

2. Of course, τ = 3/2 from the familiar

ﬁrst-passage time of a random walk [18], and aging remains intact although the cross-over

in f intr is less dramatic then before for f . In Fig. 2 we plot results for C intr from numerical

simulations, and in Fig. 3 we plot the scaling f intr for the data in Fig. 2.

As mentioned before, the stochastic annihilation process A + A

0 is closely related to

→

the random walk model with an absorbing wall and, indeed, the intrinsic scaling behavior

found here (aside from an overall factor of √t) coincides with the on reported in Eq. (9) of

Ref. [14] (for t

t + tw and ξ

t/(t + Tw)).

→

While in this walk model the aging behavior remains intact even for the intrinsic prop-

erties of the process, it is important to note that in some cases the observed aging behavior

can be entirely attributed to improper normalization of the correlation functions in a pro-

cess in which the norm depletes. Of course, such a situation can not be considered as aging

behavior. (In fact, in a recent paper [19] this eﬀect has even been proposed as a general

explanation for aging.)

III. CONCLUSIONS AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

We have shown that a simple, solvable model of a random walk near a wall can exhibit

aging behavior which illuminates many features that lead to aging behavior in more com-

7

plicated (disordered) systems, using a domain-growth picture [3]. Of course, systems with

many interacting degrees of freedom such as spin glasses or folding proteins exhibit a non-

trivial phase space structure [12] which leads to slow relaxation and aging behavior. Their

dynamics is described merely on a coarse, phenomenological level by such a simple model.

But the connection between the micro-dynamics and the macroscopic phenomena is not

only beyond the scope of this article, but as well itself very much under development still.

Instead of “explaining” experimental or theoretical results, this random walk model is meant

to illustrate some of the questions involved. (After all, it is still rare to consider situations

with broken time-translational invariance, and thus violations of the ﬂuctuation dissipation

theorem, without which two-time correlation functions would be redundant.) Furthermore,

we have discussed some of the pitfalls in identifying aging behavior in systems which do not

conserve the norm, and how to obtain the intrinsic features of such systems.

I would like to thank Maya Paczuski for discussing some of the issues considered, and

Eli Ben-Naim for a critical reading of the manuscript.

We argue that the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provides a stupendous opportunity for
the Creator of our universe (assuming one exists) to have sent a message to its occupants, using
known physics. The medium for the message is unique. We elaborate on this observation, noting
that it requires only careful adjustment of the fundamental Lagrangian, but no direct intervention
in the subsequent evolution of the universe.

Let us pose the following question. Suppose some su-
perior Being or Beings got the universe going. We do
not address the issue of whether or not this is likely, but
merely proceed with this supposition. Furthermore, sup-
pose that they actually wanted to notify us that the uni-
verse was intentionally created. The question we would
like to ask is: How would they send us a message?

That the universe was started by superior Beings is not
only the province of religious thoughts from the earliest
days of the human race, but has also been a staple of
science ﬁction. In one of our favorite scenarios, our uni-
verse is a school-assigned science experiment [1] carried
out by a high school student in a meta-universe. Perhaps
he or she or it even started an assortment of universes
like ant farms and stashed them away somewhere in the
basement, out of his or her or its parent’s way. Per-
haps by now he has lost interest and forgotten about the
universes, leaving some to expand, others to collapse, in
complete futility and silence. But, perhaps not without
leaving a message for the occupants....

The popular press has been rife with suggestions on
where the message might be found. One suggestion, for
example, is that there might be a coded message in the
human genome. In the United States, people with cer-
tain religious convictions have even imagined that the
message might be encoded in the rock formation of the
Grand Canyon, as another example. In our opinion, such
suggestions are clearly not universal enough, and they
seem to require direct intervention by the Creator during
the evolution of the universe. Another possibility, that a
message might be hidden deep in the digits of pi or the
Riemann zeta function, is also appealing, but we have
no way of addressing how feasible that might be without
some measure over possible realizations of mathematics.

If one of the present authors had gotten the universe
going and if he had wanted to announce this fact, he
would clearly want all the advanced civilizations, not
just in our galaxy, but in the entire universe, to know.
The genomic sequence is limited to civilizations involv-

ing (presumably) some subset of possible life forms based
on carbon. To think that the message is carved in the
geological record of one particular country on some in-
signiﬁcant dust speck of a planet is somewhat far fetched
to say the least.

We have convinced ourselves that the medium for the
message is unique: it could only be the cosmic microwave
background. The cosmic microwave background is in ef-
fect a giant billboard in the sky, visible to all technologi-
cally advanced civilizations. Since diﬀerent regions of the
sky are causally disconnected, only the Being “present
at the creation” could place a message there. (There are
also cosmic neutrino and gravity wave backgrounds, but
given the elusive nature of neutrinos and gravity waves
it seems that photons are a better choice for carriers of
the message.)

The variances of the CMB temperature distribution,
projected onto spherical coordinates, are given by num-
bers denoted by Cl
[2]. Here l is the usual angular
momentum quantum number which appears in spheri-
cal harmonics Ylm. Currently planned experiments are
104. There is a
capable of measuring Cl’s up to l
fundamental (statistical) limit on the accuracy ∆Cl to
which we can determine each Cl, due to so-called cosmic
variance. Since we only have (2l + 1) possible samples,
we obtain

The next question is what might the message be. We
thought of various possibilities and decided that the best
choice would be the following. We now know, and we
suppose that any civilization advanced enough to de-
tect Cl in the comic microwave background would also
know, that three of the four fundamental interactions
are governed by gauge theories, based on the Lie alge-
bras U (1)
E(6)
[3]. Thus, we suggest that the coded message would sim-
ply be an announcement along the line “Hey guys, the
universe is governed by gauge theories, and the relevant
algebras are such and such.”

As is well known, all Lie algebras are uniquely charac-
terized [4] by Dynkin diagrams or alternatively Cartan
matrices. The Cartan matrices are simply square ma-

trices whose entries are mostly zero, with the non-zero
entries equal to either 2 or
1. For example the Cartan
matrix for E(6) is

This could easily be coded as a sequence of bits, with
the ﬁrst bits specifying the coding system (by listing the
simplest algebras in order of complexity), and later bits
describing the actual gauge “theory of not quite every-
thing.”

We note that the amount of information that could
be encoded in the numbers Cl is limited. As a speciﬁc
suggestion, let us assume that inﬂationary cosmology is
correct and suppose that before the Big Bang the Cre-
ator ﬁne tuned the inﬂaton potential with small devia-
tions from ﬂatness. These would lead to deviations from
the usual scale-invariant spectrum of density perturba-
tions. An advanced civilization, having independently
measured the number of baryons, amount of dark en-
ergy, and so forth in the universe, could detect any small
deviations from what would have resulted from scale in-
variant density perturbations, and interpret these as an

sured? If the limiting resolution is of order 1/√l, then

of information can be encoded. This might be enough to
give the ﬁrst dozen or so Cartan matrices (to establish
the pattern of encoding) and the ﬁnal result specifying
the grand-uniﬁed gauge group and perhaps the matter
representations.

Of course this is just one speciﬁc suggestion. Perhaps
our collective scientiﬁc mind is still too puny to guess
what the message on the billboard in the sky might read.
For instance, string theorists might argue that the mes-
sage would simply specify the correct string theory, as-
suming that such a thing exists. Certainly, many other
possible messages exist [5].

We can also think of other ways of encoding [6] the
message itself, and again our present knowledge of quan-
tum mechanics and cosmology may be insuﬃciently ad-
vanced. Our current understanding is that the primordial
ﬂuctuations are due to quantum ﬂuctuations. Perhaps
the superior Beings are able to manipulate quantum ﬂuc-
tuations at will. (That may be taken as one manifestation
of being superior.) We simply do not understand quan-
tum mechanics beyond the algorithmic level. Or perhaps
the “ﬁnger of God” came down during recombination and
photon decoupling to imprint the desired ﬂuctuations on
the cosmic microwave background. While requiring ac-
tive intervention in our universe, this is at least far more
plausible than the ﬁnger of God rearranging the genomic
sequence of Homo sapiens at some point during our evo-
lution.

In conclusion, we believe that we have raised an in-
triguing possibility: a universal message might be en-
coded in the cosmic background. When more accurate
CMB data becomes available, we urge that it be ana-
lyzed carefully for possible patterns. This may be even
more fun than SETI.

[3] It is an intriguing fact that the sequence E(6) →
SO(10) → SU (5) could be obtained by sucessively chop-
ping oﬀ a circle starting with the Dynkin diagram for E(6).
Mathematically, SO(10) could be regarded as E(4) and
SU (5) as E(3).

[4] A highly useful review was given by R. Slansky, Phys.
Rept. 79 (1981) 1. See in particular Section 4, Tables 5
and 6.

[5] For example, another suggestion might be the sequence
of prime numbers, but this strikes us as not informative

enough. (One may even conceive of civilizations for which
the prime numbers may not hold as much fascination as
for our own.)

[6] Another possibility might be to hide the message inside
the ﬁne structure “constant” or some other parameter of
physics. Aside from the fact that the ﬁne structure con-

stant evolves due to renormalization (hence is scale de-
pendent), experimental considerations may make it hard
to measure any constant to 105 bits of accuracy. Conse-
quently, the encoded message must be even shorter!

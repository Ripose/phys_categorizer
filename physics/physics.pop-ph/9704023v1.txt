And the Winner Is . . .
Predicting the Outcome of the 150m Showdown

In a mere 9.84 seconds on July 27, 1996, Donovan Bailey performed multi-
ple tasks at once: he won Olympic Gold, earned the title of “World’s Fastest
Man”, defeated one of the best 100m ﬁnal ﬁelds ever in record–breaking
time, restored Canadian sprinting to world dominance, forever banished the
tainted poltergeist of Ben Johnson, and shut out the United States from the
medal positions. Meanwhile, in 19.32 seconds, Michael Johnson performed a
similar number of tasks: he smashed beyond all recognition the 200m world
record in a time faster than anyone though possible, he recorded blazing
splits (10.12s, 9.20s), and (albeit due in part to the poor math skills of some
sports commentators) his time evoked the thought in many minds that he
was now the rightful heir to the title recently bestowed on Bailey.

Thanks to this hooplah, the Ottawa–based Magellan Group has set the
stage for a match between these two one–man sprint powerhouses. On Sun-
day, June 1st at Skydome, almost 10 months after their respective world
record performances, Donovan Bailey and Michael Johnson will speed over
150m in what is perhaps to be the most hyped Canada vs US sprint show-
down since the 100m ﬁnal in Seoul on September 24, 1988. The question on
most minds is naturally: who will win?

There are numerous ways to guess the end result. One can consider the
training of each individual. Bailey is a 100m specialist; does he have the
power to generate world–class speed around a turn, then sustain it over a
straight equal in length to his event? His best marks at 200m stand as 20.76s
(20.39s wind–assisted) in 1994. Johnson, on the other hand, is a 200/400
doubler. Does he have the sheer power to match Bailey over half the race?
His 100m PB is 10.09s, also from 1994. Surely, if nothing else, this problem
almost borders on the philosophical! It has ringings of: “What happens when
an irresistible force meets an immutable object?”

One can also look at the numbers that came out of Atlanta. Bailey was
the last out of the blocks (reaction time of +0.174s), reached an astounding

1

maximum velocity of 12.1 m/s at 60m, and accounting for tail–wind (+0.7
m/s), ran faster than did Ben Johnson at the Rome WC of 1987. Michael
Johnson recorded the previously mentioned splits of 10.12s/9.20s, led the
ﬁeld at the line by over 0.3s in a sprint, and not counting his earlier 19.66s
from the US Trials, broke the long–standing record of Pietro Mennea by 0.4s.
Statistician Robert Tibshirani of the University of Toronto performed
such an analysis, taking into account a 1973 model of Mathematician Joseph
Keller (who in turn based his model on the 1920s work of Physiologist A.
Hill). It was found that, with a modiﬁcation to Keller’s model, Bailey would
defeat Johnson by a margin of 0.03s–0.22s in 95 out of 100 races, or at a 95%
conﬁdence level (statistically–speaking).

However, Tibshirani noted tha his model did not take into account the
energy lost by a sprinter (in this case, Bailey) as he rounds the curve. The
Skydome track will have a 50m curve + 100m straight conﬁguration, so such
a model is limited by this non–linearity. What to do?

Contact a Physicist who has a love of track and ﬁeld! Falling into such a
category, I have tried my hand at prediction using a crystal ball of vector–
addition. Without sounding too much like a Classical Mechanics class, let
me brieﬂy outline the problem and solution. The model used by Tibshirani
assumes that the sprinter can exert a time–dependent force f (t) = f −ct; that
is, as time progresses, he fatigues. If we know certain information about the
race (e.g. splits, speeds), we can determine the values of f and c. However,
the sprinter also feels internal resistances which sap his strength (anaerobic
exhaustion, for example), so combining terms for all these eﬀects, we can
obtain a diﬀerential equation for his net acceleration.

This works ﬁne for a linear race (100m), but what of the turn? A sprinter
of mass m rounding a turn of radius R feels a force of mv(t)2/R. Of course,
in order to stay on the track (a useful strategy), he must combat this with
his energy reserves. The centrifugal force mv(t)2/R acts perpendicular to the
forward motion (dependent on the speed of the runner at time t), so we have
to add the force terms as vector, the root of the sum of the squares f (t)2
and m2v(t)4/R2. So far so good, but such an assumption overcompensates
for the curve, that is, it predicts 200m times which are well above what one
would expect for world class performances. The key is to remember that a
sprinter leans into the turn, letting gravity do some of the work combating
the centrifugal force. So, a determination of exactly what fraction p of this
force the runner actually feels can help predict times run on curves.

1 The 150m Showdown

The 150m race will be run as a 50m curve + 100m straight. While the exact
conﬁguration has yet to be decided, the best choice would be to have a curve
of fairly large radius (larger than for regular indoor tracks). From ﬂoor plans
for the event, it seems as if the curve will be close in size to those of outdoor
tracks. I’ll assume that the race would be run in the equivalents of lane 3
and 4. While the model does not account for wind assistance (Bailey’s +0.7
m/s, and Johnson’s +0.4 m/s), it’s reasonable to assume that each athlete
is stronger than last year and capable of moving slightly faster.

Using our model, we can take a stab at how Bailey might be able to
handle this race. The value of p we should use is still up in the air, but it
seems likely that it won’t be small. After all, Bailey is a 100m specialist, and
wouldn’t handle turns very well. So, we’ll take p to be either 0.6, 0.7, or at
the worst, 0.8 (these are the squares of the percentage of centrifugal forces
felt, which would mean we’re roughly considering between 75% and 90% of
the force).

Michael Johnson’s 50m split in his Olympic 200m ﬁnal was about 6.4s,
so assuming similar conditions, Bailey clearly leads oﬀ the curve. After this
point, it’s hard to determine how Johnson would handle the straight. His
split of 10.12s was run on a complete turn, so we could guess that he could
shave oﬀ about 0.05s. This would put his Skydome split at about 10.07s
(slightly quicker than his 1994 PB). Continuing this logic, let’s guess that
he’d be able to hold a greater speed over the straight, and clock in between
0.05–0.10s faster than his Atlanta 150m split of 14.83s. Since Johnson is
probably a more consistent curve runner, we could assume that his time
doesn’t vary more than 0.01s from lane to lane.
If this is the case, then
Johnson could optimistically clock between 14.73s – 14.78s on June 1st.

The results of the model runs for Bailey are listed in Tables 2,3, and are
broken up into 50m splits. Since the model calculates “raw” race times, a
reaction time must be added on (I’ve assumed a +0.170s reaction, similar to
Atlanta). The “ﬁnal” race times are in the last column of the tables.

For the best Bailey guess (p = 0.60), he takes Johnson regardless of lane
choice (assuming 14.73s is an overestimate for Johnson). However, for larger
p, which may be more realistic, Bailey’s lane choice starts to become crucial.
That is, for p = 0.70, he can only win if he’s assigned the outside lane. In
the worst case, Bailey gets edged out, drained from ﬁghting the curve.

2 How about 200m?

This model could also be used to predict possible 200m times which Bailey
might be able to run. His PBs are recorded as 20.76s, and 20.39s (wind–
assisted), both in 1994. Over the span of 3 years, it’s most likely the case
that his overall endurance has increased, and that he would be capable of
running in the range of 20.30s (again, bearing in mind that his training is as
a 100m specialist).

Tables 4 and 5 show predictions for outdoor and indoor races, respec-
tively. Assuming the target range described above, then outdoor p values
of 0.50 – 0.70 provide realistic estimates (20.28s – 20.58s). Meanwhile, for
indoor venues (Table 5), lower values of p give believable times. These are
slower than the outdoor predictions, as one might expect, yet still within the
grasp of the 100m champion (around 20.47s–20.86s).

The higher values of p for the indoor track give what are certainly inaccu-
rate times, and hardly world class. Recall, though, that the centrifugal force
depends on 1/R; a sprinter traveling at the same speed over a radius half
as big feels twice the force. Since p is the square of the percentage of force
felt, then a ratio of 4:1 for outdoor:indoor values of p seems reasonable. This
is why tracks are banked, so the sprinter doesn’t have to expend too much
energy to compensate for the curve (unless the race is run in Sherbrooke,
where the sprinter must ﬁght not to fall into the center!).

3 And the winner is...

So, what is the end results of all this? Will Bailey win the 150m showdown,
or will Johnson? It all depends on how each handles the turn, their lane
assignments, and their reaction times (which, in essence, are the factors that
determine the winner in any race!). Realistically, people aren’t machines
that abide by equations, so the model doesn’t pretend to say how Bailey will
deﬁnitely run. What it does show, though, is that the race is not a clear–cut
victory by either party:
it literally could come right down to the wire. If
each performs at their Atlanta prime (or better), then I, for one, will be on
the edge of my seat at Skydome for those 14.?? seconds!

What will the victory signify? Should Johnson prevail, would he usurp
Bailey’s title of World’s Fastest Man? In my opinion, no. Bailey won the

4

traditional event to claim the title, set a world record, and achieved a higher
speed than Johnson. American sour–grapes aside, this spectacle will only
serve to show who would win over 150m. And truthfully, the winners will be
Bailey and Johnson, who will walk from Skydome a combined $1.5M richer
than they were the day before. Canadian Track and Field will win, because
the event will hopefully regenerate signiﬁcant interest in the sport. Finally,
the audience will win, because they will be treated to a magniﬁcent race
between two of history’s greatest sprinters.

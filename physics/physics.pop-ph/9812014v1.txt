Abstract

The note presents a formula for the prediction of the rotation pe-
riods of the planets and asteroids. This formula, which is like the
Titius-Bode law, gives a good agreement with the rotation periods of
most planets, shows that Venus is retrograde, and that there must be
ﬁve objects between Mars and Jupiter. This formula may be of some
relevance in understanding the dynamics of the early solar system.
Keywords: Rotation periods, solar system, Titius-Bode law.

It is generally believed that the Titius-Bode relationship between the
distance of the planets from the sun may have some signiﬁcance regarding
the formation of the solar system. If there is a similar simple pattern deﬁning
the rotation periods of the planets then that may also provide clues regarding
In this note I present a simple

relationship that is in good agreement with the rotation period information
of the superior planets, and it indicates that Venus has retrograde rotation
although it does not give an accurate value of the rotation of this planet or
Mercury.

Instead of considering the rotation periods directly, I consider M = d
p ,
where d is the distance from the sun in astronomical units (AU) and p is

the rotation period in days. M is a measure of the relative speed of the sun
across the horizon. The sequence for increasing M is not exactly the same as
the sequence in terms of distances from the sun. For example, the positions
of Venus and Mercury are reversed and we will see later that our formula
indicates 5 objects between Mars and Jupiter—these could be asteroids and
Pluto—and one between Jupiter and Saturn (another asteroid).

The table below gives M, and its oﬀset value Q = M + 0.337, for the

planets in order of increasing values are:

12.837
21.867

The Q = d

p + 0.337 values of the major asteroids are:

Ceres (7.16), Pallas (8.86), Juno (9.17), Vesta (11.02), Astraea
(4.0), Hebe (8.326), Iris (8.38), Hygiea (4.42), Eunomia (10.76),
Euphrosyne (14.08).

These numbers and those in the Table above have been computed from

the information in Reference 1.

We now propose the following formula for the Q-numbers for the planets:

Q(n + 1) = 1.361Q(n)

where Q(0) = 0.2863. This means that the period, p(n) in days, of the nth
planet is given by:

p(n) =

d(n)
(1.361)n × 0.2863 − 0.337

Here the sequence order is Venus (0), Mercury (1), Earth (5), Mars (6),

Jupiter (12), Saturn (14), Uranus (15), and Neptune (16).

Given 17 items, one can interpolate by using a polynomial that is of
16th degree, with 17 constants. Our formula uses just 3 constants and the
Q-values are ﬁxed by only 2 numbers. So our formula provides signiﬁcant
compression of information. An interesting question to ask is: What is the
best that can be done in terms of such compression?

Beginning with the Q−number for earth in this sequence, namely 1.337,

and multiplying successively by 1.361, We get the numbers:

1.337, 1.820, 2.477, 3.371, 4.587, 6.243, 8.497, 11.565, 15.740, 21.422, 29.155, 39.680

We obtain good agreement with the value for Mars (1.820), which is
followed by 5 additional values (these could be asteroids and Pluto), the
value for Jupiter (11.565) which is oﬀ by about 10 percent, another value
(15.74) that is near the correct value for the asteroid Euphrosyne (14.08),
and then very good agreement with the correct values for Saturn, Uranus,
and Neptune.

Considering the values intermediate to those for Mars and Saturn, we
have: 2.477 (no asteroid known to the author); 3.371 (Astraea); 4.587 (Hy-
giea); 6.243 (Ceres; but Pluto is closer); 8.497 (Hebe, Iris, Pallas); 11.565
(Vesta, and Jupiter); 15.74 (Euphrosyne).

On the other hand, by dividing 1.337 successively by 1.361, we get:

0.982, 0.722, 0.530, 0.390, 0.286

There are no objects for the ﬁrst three of these values; the next two,
come closest to the values for Mercury and Venus. When the constant 0.337
is subtracted, the M values for Mercury and Venus obtained from the formula
are 5.4 × 10−2 and −5.0 × 10−2. These are about one order of magnitude oﬀ,
but provide the correct direction of rotation for Venus.

When we consider the above information in conjunction with the Titius-
Bode law, it becomes clear why there could not be a single planet at the
distance of 2.8 AU, because our rotation formula calls for 5 objects between
Mars and Jupiter.

The extra three inferior planets provided by the formula with the values
of Q = 0.532, 0.723, 0.983 may have been captured by the earth and Mars as
their satellites: Moon, Phobos, Deimos.

Our formula (1) depends on just 2 constants: the multiplication factor
of 1.361 and the starting value for Q(0) = 0.2863. That just two constants

are able to provide a good ﬁt for the rotation periods of most of the planets
and many asteroids suggests that this formula may be of some relevance in
representing the dynamics of the early solar system.

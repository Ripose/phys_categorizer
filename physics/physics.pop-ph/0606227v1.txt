Friendly units for coldness

Measures of temperature that center around human experience get lots of use. Of course thermal
physics insights of the last century have shown that reciprocal temperature (1/kT) has applications
that temperature addresses less well.
In addition to taking on negative absolute values under
population inversion (e.g. of magnetic spins), bits and bytes turn 1/kT into an informatic measure
of the thermal ambient for developing correlations within any complex system. We show here that,
∼
in the human-friendly units of bytes and food Calories, water freezes when 1/kT
= 200 ZB/Cal or
∼
= 5 Cal/YB. Casting familiar benchmarks into these terms shows that habitable human space
kT
requires coldness values (part of the time, at least) between 0 and 40 ZB/Cal with respect body
◦
temperature ∼ 100
F, a range in kT of ∼ 1 Cal/YB. Insight into these physical quantities underlying
thermal equilibration may prove useful for budding scientists, as well as the general public, in years
ahead.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Bruno Maddox’s article1 in the June 2006 Discover
Magazine on the Nightmare of Divided Loyalties be-
tween Fahrenheit and Centigrade is timely for this
age of information. That’s because thermodynamics
texts2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 (following pre-1960 papers11,12,13 by
Shannon and Jaynes have increasingly exploited recip-
rocal temperature (Garrod’s coldness14) to capture the
essence of temperature as equilibrant more generally (e.g.
for spin systems), and as energy’s uncertainty slope i.e.
a rate of increase in state uncertainty (information units)
per unit increase in thermal energy.

One reason is that thermal physics insights of the last
century15 have shown reciprocal temperature (1/kT) to
have applications that temperature addresses less well.
In addition to taking on negative absolute values under
population inversion (e.g. of magnetic spins), bits and
bytes turn it into an informatic measure of the thermal
ambient (to wit: the mutual information value of free
energy)16,17,18,19 for developing correlations in all sorts
of complex systems (e.g. within molecules, galaxies, and
biological communities)20.

II. SAY WHAT?

How does coldness (1/kT, or energy’s Lagrange mul-
tiplier) work? Basically heat ﬂows spontaneously (by
chance maximizing uncertainty) from low to high uncer-
tainty slopes that range between minus and plus inﬁnity,
at which end points reciprocal coldness (kT) asymptot-
ically goes to absolute zero. Thus one thing traditional
treatments miss is that negative absolute temperatures
are routinely employed (say in the LASER on your DVD
reader, or in a domino toppling contest) by moving up the
temperature scale, rather than down through zero. Un-
likely inversions (negative uncertainty slopes) even add
something to the spectator value of gambling.

Taken in reverse, it also means that new correlations
between subsystems extract a price in the thermalization

of available work. The price decreases if the heat created
can be dumped into a colder reservoir, making this obser-
vation relevant to molecular engines as well as to humans
faced with a warming environment.

III. CALORIES AND BYTES

If (inspired by Bruno’s request for something every-
one can relate to) you put coldness (1/kT) into every-
day units (Calories and bytes) then you’ll ﬁnd that wa-
ter freezes at almost precisely 200 zettabytes per Calorie
where zetta is the SI preﬁx for 1021. In other words, re-
setting a 200 gigabyte DNA string or computer memory
to speciﬁed values will convert at least a picoCalorie of
available work into ice-melting heat. The same opera-
tion may generate less heat, if the heat can be dumped
at lower temperature. Hence the bit depth of a digital
camera can be made larger if its CCD is cooled, and when
it’s cold outside you in principle really can get more work
done.

As a result one can say (cf. Figure 1) that “chilly Eu-
rope” at 0◦F is about 14 ZB/Cal colder than ice water,
which at 0◦C is about 15 ZB/Cal colder than room tem-
perature. In turn room temperature is about 10 ZB/Cal
colder than “hot Europe” at 100◦F, which is approxi-
mately the temperature inside your body. At ambient
temperatures below these, our food-powered metabolism
plus some blankets might keep you warm for a while.
At ambient temperatures above these our metabolism,
rather than keeping us warm, generates waste heat that
we must actively export to survive. Food is less useful
then. Thus our “long term survival zone” extends from
about 0 to 40 zettabytes per Calorie colder than 98.6◦F.
Weather persistently outside this range is a fundamental
problem for each of us, even though it might not seem
so if you mainly see persistent heat or cold from within
a temperature-controlled shell.

our blood must run cold. More to the point, telling stu-
dents about physical in addition to historical units for the
parameter that equilibrates on thermal contact could fur-
ther prepare them to recognize other cross-disciplinary
connections. Such connections (in cross-cutting ﬁelds
like nanoscience, informatics, and astrobiology) will likely
prove useful for tackling the multiscale challenges that

IV. OTHER BENCHMARKS

Boiling water’s coldness is around 50 ZB/Cal below
ice water’s 200 ZB/Cal absolute. Even lower uncertainty
slopes occur in the 9 ZB/Cal of our sun’s surface, the
0 ZB/Cal of a spin system with equal up/down popu-
lations, and the -7 ZB/Cal of a He-Ne LASER’s 99%
excited-Ne inversion. Familiar things with really high
coldness include dry ice at 35 ZB/Cal above freezing, liq-
uid nitrogen at nearly 800 ZB/Cal absolute, liquid helium
at over 13000 ZB/Cal, and our universe’s blackbody am-
bient at around 20000 ZB/Cal. Thus local issues notwith-
standing, the larger world around us is pretty cold! The
strange behaviors of liquid nitrogen and helium also re-
ﬂect high uncertainty slopes, and thus the extreme in-
creases in state uncertainty that result from adding small
amounts of heat.

our species faces in the days and millenia21 ahead.

Of course given our cultures’ tenacity for repetition,
plus the fact that kT is a useful measure of energy ﬂuc-
tuation in quadratic systems (e.g. kT is also 1/40 eV/nat
at STP), it is unlikely that bytes per Calorie will become
a routine part of the morning weather report anytime
soon.
In that context, perhaps the reader can instead
ﬁnd a mnemonic measure of kT (cf. Fig. 2) to assist in
the clarifying move from historical, to natural, perspec-
tives on that continuum from cool to warm and beyond.

1. - Introduction.

The question of Super-luminal (V 2 > c2) objects or waves has a long story, starting
perhaps in 50 b.C. with Lucretius’ De Rerum Natura (cf., e.g., book 4, line 201: [<<Quone
vides citius debere et longius ire/ Multiplexque loci spatium transcurrere eodem/ Tempore
quo Solis pervolgant lumina coelum?>>]). Still in pre-relativistic times, one meets various
related works, from those by J.J.Thomson to the papers by the great A.Sommerfeld.
With Special Relativity, however, since 1905 the conviction spread over that the speed c
of light in vacuum was the upper limit of any possible speed. For instance, R.C.Tolman
in 1917 believed to have shown by his “paradox” that the existence of particles endowed
with speeds larger than c would have allowed sending information into the past. Such a
conviction blocked for more than half a century —aside from an isolated paper (1922) by
the Italian mathematician G.Somigliana— any research about Superluminal speeds. Our
problem started to be tackled again essentially in the ﬁfties and sixties, in particular after
the papers[1] by E.C.George Sudarshan et al., and later on[2] by E.Recami, R.Mignani,
et al. [who rendered the expressions subluminal and Superluminal of popular use by their
works at the beginning of the Seventies], as well as by H.C.Corben and others (to conﬁne
ourselves to the theoretical researches). The ﬁrst experiments looking for tachyons were
performed by T.Alv¨ager et al.

Superluminal objects were called tachyons, T, by G.Feinberg, from the Greek word
τ αχ´υς, quick, and this induced us in 1970 to coin the term bradyon, B, for ordinary
subluminal (v2 < c2) objects, from the Greek word βραδ´υς, slow). At last, objects
travelling exactly at the speed of light are called “luxons”.

In recent years, terms as “tachyon” and “superluminal” fell unhappily into the
(cunning, rather than crazy) hands of pranotherapists and mere cheats, who started
squeezing money out of simple-minded people; for instance by selling plasters (!) that
should cure various illnesses by “emitting tachyons”... We are dealing with them here,

however, since at least four diﬀerent experimental sectors of physics seem to indicate the
actual existence of Superluminal motions [it is an old use of ours to write Superluminal
with a capital S], thus conﬁrming some long-standing theoretical predictions[3]. So much
so that even the N.Y.Times commented on May 30, 2000, upon two of such experiments,
imitated the next day (and again at the end of the next July) by nearly all the world
press.
In this rapid informative paper, after a sketchy theoretical introduction, we are
setting forth a reasoned outline of the experimental state-of-art: brief, but accompanied
by a bibliography suﬃcient in some cases to provide the interested readers with coherent,
adequate information; and without forgetting to call attention —at least in the two sectors
more after fashion today— to some other worthy experiments.

2. Special and Extended Relativity.

Let us premise that special relativity (SR), abundantly veriﬁed by experience, can
be built on two simple, natural Postulates: 1) that the laws (of electromagnetism and
mechanics) be valid not only for a particular observer, but for the whole class of the
2) that space and time be homogeneous and space be moreover
“inertial” observers:
isotropic. From these Postulates one can theoretically infer that one, and only one,
invariant speed: and experience tells us such a speed to be that, c, of light in vacuum; in
fact, light possesses the peculiar feature of presenting always the same speed in vacuum,
It is just that feature, of being invariant,
even when we run towards or away from it.
that makes quite exceptional the speed c: no bradyons, and no tachyons, can enjoy the
same property!

Another (known) consequence of our Postulates is that the total energy of an or-
dinary particle increases when its speed v increases, tending to inﬁnity when v tends to
c. Therefore, inﬁnite forces would be needed for a bradyon to reach the speed c. This
fact generated the popular opinion that speed c can be neither achieved nor overcome.
However, as speed c photons exist which are born live and die always at the speed of
light (without any need of accelerating from rest to the light speed), so particles can
exist —tachyons[4]— always endowed with speeds V larger than c (see Fig.1). This cir-
cumstance has been picturesquely illustrated by George Sudarshan (1972) with reference
to an imaginary demographer studying the population patterns of the Indian subconti-
nent: <<Suppose a demographer calmly asserts that there are no people North of the
Himalayas, since none could climb over the mountain ranges! That would be an absurd
conclusion. People of central Asia are born there and live there: they did not have to be
born in India and cross the mountain range. So with faster-than-light particles>>. Let
us add that, still starting from the above two Postulates (besides a third one, even more
obvious), the theory of relativity can be generalized[3,4] in such a way to accommodate
also Superluminal objects; such an extension is largely due to the Italian school, by a
series of works performed mainly in the Sixties–Seventies. Also within the “Extended
Relativity”[3] the speed c, besides being invariant, is a limiting velocity: but every limit-

2

ing value has two sides, and one can a priori approach it both from the left and from the
right.

Actually, the ordinary formulation of SR is restricted too much. For instance, even
leaving tachyons aside, it can be easily so widened as to include antimatter [5]. Then,
one ﬁnds space-time to be a priori populated by normal particles P (which travel forward
in time carrying positive energy), and by dual particles Q “which travel backwards in
time carrying negative energy”. The latter shall appear to us as antiparticles, i.e., as
particles —regularly travelling forward in time with positive energy, but— with all their
“additive” charges (e.g., the electric charge) reversed in sign!: see Fig.2. To clarify this
point, let us recall that we, macroscopic observers, have to move in time along a single,
well-deﬁned direction, to such an extent that we cannot even see a motion backwards in
time...; and every object like Q, travelling backwards in time (with negative energy), will
be necessarily reinterpreted by us as an anti-object, with opposite charges but travelling
forward in time (with positive energy).[3-5]

But let us forget about antimatter and go back to tachyons. A strong objection
against their existence is based on the opinion that by tachyons it be possible to send
signals into the past, owing to the fact that a tachyon T which —say— appears to a ﬁrst
observer O as emitted by A and absorbed by B, can appear to a second observer O′ as a
tachyon T’ which travels backwards in time with negative energy. However, by applying
(as it is obligatory to do) the same “reinterpretation rule” or switching procedure seen
above, T’ will appear to the new observer O′ just as an antitachyon T emitted by B and
absorbed by A, and therefore travelling forward in time, even if in the contrary space
direction. In such a way, every travel towards the past, and every negative energy, do
disappear...
Starting from this observation, it is possible to solve[5] the so-called causal paradoxes
associated with Superluminal motions: paradoxes which result to be the more instructive
and amusing, the more sophisticated they are; but that cannot be re-examined here
(some of them having been proposed by R.C.Tolman, J.Bell, F.A.E.Pirani, J.D.Edmonds
and others).[6,3] Let us only mention here the following. The reinterpretation principle
—according to which, in simple words, signals are carried only by objects which appear
to be endowed with positive energy— does eliminate any information transfer backwards
in time, but this has a price: That of abandoning the ingrained conviction that the
judgement about what is cause and what is eﬀect be independent of the observer. In fact,
in the case examined above, the ﬁrst observer O considers the event at A t be the cause
of the event at B. By contrast, the second observer O′ will consider the event at B as
causing the event at A. All the observers will however see the cause to happen before its
eﬀect.

Taking new objects or entities into consideration always forces us to a criticism
of our prejudices. If we require the phenomena to obey the law of (retarded) causality
with respect to all the observers, then we cannot demand also the phenomena description
“details” to be invariant: namely, we cannot demand in that case also the invariance of

3

the “cause” and “eﬀect” labels.[6,2] To illustrate the nature of our diﬃculties in accepting
that e.g. the parts of cause and eﬀect depend on the observer, let us cite an analogous
situation that does not imply present-day prejudices: <<For ancient Egyptians, who knew
only the Nile and its tributaries, which all ﬂow South to North, the meaning of the word
“south” coincided with the one of “upstream”, and the meaning of the word “north”
coincided with the one of “downstream”. When Egyptians discovered the Euphrates,
which unfortunately happens to ﬂow North to South, they passed through such a crisis
that it is mentioned in the stele of Tuthmosis I, which tells us about that inverted water
that goes downstream (i.e. towards the North) in going upstream>> (Csonka, 1970).

The last century theoretical physics led us in a natural way to suppose the exis-
tence of various types of objects: magnetic monopoles, quarks, strings, tachyons, besides
black-holes: and various sectors of physics could not go on without them, even if the
existence of none of them is certain (also because attention has not yet been paid to some
links existing among them: e.g., a Superluminal electric charge is expected to behave as
a magnetic monopole; and a black-hole a priori can be the source of tachyonic matter).
According to Democritus of Abdera, everything that was thinkable without meeting con-
tradictions had to exist somewhere in the unlimited universe. This point of view —which
was given by M.Gell-Mann the name of “totalitarian principle”— was later on expressed
(T.H.White) in the humorous form “Anything not forbidden is compulsory”. Applying it
to tachyons, Sudarshan was led to claim that if tachyons exist, they must to be found; if
they do not exist, we must be able to say clearly why...

3. The experimental state-of-the-art.

Extended Relativity can allow a better understanding of many aspects also of ordi-
nary relativistic physics, even if tachyons would not exist in our cosmos as asymptotically
free objects. As already said, we are dealing with them —however— since their topic is
presently returning after fashion, especially because of the fact that at least three or four
diﬀerent experimental sectors of physics seem to suggest the possible existence of faster-
than-light motions. We wish to put forth in the following some information (mainly
bibliographical) about the experimental results obtained in each one of those diﬀerent
physics sectors.

A) Neutrinos – First: A long series of experiments, started in 1971, seems to show
2 of the mass m0 of muonic neutrinos, and more recently of electronic
that the square m0
neutrinos too, is negative; which, if conﬁrmed, would mean that (when using a na¨ive lan-
guage, commonly adopted) such neutrinos possess an “imaginary mass” and are therefore
[In Extended Relativity, the dispersion relation for
tachyonic, or mainly tachyonic.[7,3]
a free tachyon becomes E2 − p2 = −m2
o, and there is no need therefore of imaginary

4

masses...].

B) Galactic Micro-quasars – Second: As to the apparent Superluminal expansions ob-
served in the core of quasars[8] and, recently, in the so-called galactic microquasars[9], we
shall not deal here with that problem, too far from the other topics of this paper: without
mentioning that for those astronomical observations there exist orthodox interpretations,
based on ref.[10], that are accepted by the astrophysicists’ majority. For a theoretical
discussion, see ref.[11]. Here, let us mention only that simple geometrical considerations
in Minkowski space show that a single Superluminal light source would look[11,3]:
(i)
initially, in the “optical boom” phase (analogous to the acoustic “boom” produced by
a plane travelling with constant supersonic speed), as an intense source which appears
suddenly; and that (ii) afterwards seem to split into TWO objects receding one from the
other with speed V > 2c.

C) Evanescent waves and “tunnelling photons” – Third: Within quantum mechan-
ics (and precisely in the tunnelling processes), it had been shown that the tunnelling time
—ﬁrstly evaluated as a simple “phase time” and later on calculated through the analysis
of the wavepacket behaviour— does not depend on the barrier width in the case of opaque
barriers (“Hartman eﬀect”)[12]: which implies Superluminal and arbitrarily large (group)
velocities V inside long enough barriers: see Fig.3. Experiments that may verify this pre-
diction by, say, electrons are diﬃcult. Luckily enough, however, the Schroedinger equation
in the presence of a potential barrier is mathematically identical to the Helmholtz equa-
tion for an electromagnetic wave propagating e.g. down a metallic waveguide along the
x-axis: and a barrier height U bigger than the electron energy E corresponds (for a given
wave frequency) to a waveguide transverse size lower than a cut-oﬀ value. A segment of
undersized guide does therefore behave as a barrier for the wave (photonic barrier)[13]:
So that the wave assumes therein —like an electron inside a quantum barrier— an imagi-
nary momentum or wave-number and gets, as a consequence, exponentially damped along
x. In other words, it becomes an evanescent wave (going back to normal propagation,
even if with reduced amplitude, when the narrowing ends and the guide returns to its
initial transverse size). Thus, a tunnelling experiment can be simulated[13] by having
recourse to evanescent waves (for which the concept of group velocity can be properly
extended[14]). And the fact that evanescent waves travel with Superluminal speeds has
been actually veriﬁed in a series of famous experiments (cf. Fig.4).

Namely, various experiments —performed since 1992 onwards by G.Nimtz at
Cologne[15], by R.Chiao’s and A.Steinberg’s group at Berkeley[16], by A.Ranfagni and
colleagues at Florence[17], and by others at Vienna, Orsay, Rennes[17]— veriﬁed that
“tunnelling photons” travel with Superluminal group velocities. Such experiments roused
a great deal of interest[18], also within the non-specialized press, and were reported by
Scientiﬁc American, Nature, New Scientist, and even Newsweek, etc. Let us add that also
Extended Relativity had predicted[19] evanescent waves to be endowed with faster-than-c

5

speeds; the whole matter appears to be therefore theoretically selfconsistent. The debate
in the current literature does not refer to the experimental results (which can be correctly
reproduced by numerical elaborations[20,21] based on Maxwell equations only), but rather
to the question whether they allow, or do not allow, sending signals or information with
Superluminal speed[21,14].

Let emphasize that the most interesting experiment of this series is the one with
two “barriers” (e.g., with two segments of udersized waveguide separated by a piece of
normal-sized waveguide: Fig.5). For suitable frequency bands —i.e., for “tunnelling” far
from resonances—, it was found that the total crossing time does not depend on the length
of the intermediate (normal) guide: namely, that the beam speed along it is inﬁnite[22].
This agrees with what predicted by Quantum Mechanics for the non-resonant tunnelling
trough two successive opaque barriers (the tunnelling phase time, which depends on the
entering energy, has been shown by us to be independent of the distance between the
two barriers[23]). Such an important experiment could and should be repeated, taking
advantage also of the circumstance that quite interesting evanescence regions can be easily
constructed in the most varied manners, like by several “photonic band-gap materials” or
gratings (it being possible tu use from multilayer dielectric mirrors, to semiconductors, to
photonic crystals...)

We cannot skip a further topic —which, being delicate, should not appear in a
brief review like this one— since the last experimental contribution to it (performed at
Princeton by J.Wang et al. and published in Nature on 7.20.00) is one of the two arti-
cles mentioned by the N.Y.Times and commented at the end of July, 2000, by the whole
world press. Even if in Extended Relativity all the ordinary causal paradoxes seem to be
solvable[3,6], nevertheless one has to bear in mind that (whenever it is met an object, O,
travelling with Superluminal speed) one may have to deal with negative contributions to
the tunnelling times[24]: and this ought not to be regarded as unphysical. In fact, when-
ever an “object” (particle, electromagnetic pulse,,...) O overcomes the inﬁnite speed[3,6]
with respect to a certain observer, it will afterwards appear to the same observer as the
“anti-object” O travelling in the opposite space direction[3,6]. For instance, when going
on from the lab to a frame F moving in the same direction as the particles or waves
entering the barrier region, the object O penetrating through the ﬁnal part of the barrier
(with almost inﬁnite speed[12,21,23], like in Figs.3) will appear in the frame F as an
anti-object O crossing that portion of the barrier in the opposite space–direction[3,6]. In
the new frame F , therefore, such anti-object O would yield a negative contribution to the
tunnelling time: which could even result, in total, to be negative. For any clariﬁcations,
see refs.[18]. Ci`o che vogliamo qui What we want to stress here is that the appearance of
such negative times is predicted by Relativity itself, on the basis of the ordinary postu-
lates[3,6,24,12,21]. (In the case of a non-polarized beam,, the wave anti-packet coincides
with the initial wave packet; if a photon is however endowed with helicity λ = +1, the
anti-photon will bear the opposite helicity λ = −1). From the theoretical point of view,
besides refs.[24,12,21,6,3], see refs.[25]. On the (quite interesting!) experimental side, see

6

papers [26], the last one having already been mentioned above.

Let us add here that, via quantum interference eﬀects in three-levels atomic systems,
it is possible to obtain dielectrics with refraction indices very rapidly varying as a function
of frequency, with almost complete absence of light absorption (i.e., with quantum induced
transparency) [27]. The group velocity of a light pulse propagating in such a medium can
decrease to very low values, either positive or negatives, with no pulse distortion.
It is
known that experiments were performed both in atomic samples at room temperature, and
in Bose-Einstein condensates, which showed the possibility of reducing the speed of light
to few meters per second. Similar, but negative group velocities —implying a propagation
with Superluminal speeds thousands of time higher than the previously mentioned ones—
have been recently predicted, in the presence of such an “electromagnetically induced
transparency”, for light moving in a rubidium condensate[28], while the corresponding
experiments are being dome at the Florence European laboratory “LENS”.

Finally, let us emphasize that faster-than-c propagation of light pulses can be (and
was, in same cases) observed also by taking advantage of anomalous dispersion near an
absorbing line, or nonlinear and linear gain lines, or nondispersive dielectric media, or
inverted two-level media, as well as of some parametric processes in nonlinear optics (cf.
G.Kurizki et al.)

D) Superluminal Localized Solutions (SLS) to the wave equations. The “X-
shaped waves” – The fourth sector (to leave aside the others) is not less important. It
returned after fashion when some groups of capable scholars in engineering (for sociological
reasons, most physicists had abandoned the ﬁeld) rediscovered by a series of clever works
that any wave equation —to ﬁx the ideas, let us think of the electromagnetic case—
admit also solutions so much sub-luminal as Super-luminal (besides the ordinary plane
waves endowed with speed c/n). Let us recall that, starting with the pioneering work
by H.Bateman, it had slowly become known that all homogeneous wave equations (in
a general sense: scalar, electromagnetic, spinorial,...) admit wavelet-type solutions with
sub-luminal group velocities[29]. Subsequently, also Superluminal solutions started to be
written down, in refs.[30] and, independently, in refs.[31] (in one case just by the mere
application of a Superluminal Lorentz “transformation”[3,32]).

A quite important feature of some new solutions of these (which attracted much
of the attention of the engineering colleagues) is that they propagate as localized, non-
dispersive pulses: namely, according to the Courant and Hilbert’s[29] terminology, as
It is easy to realize the practical importance, for in-
“undistorted progressive waves”.
stance, of a radio transmission carried out by localized beams, independently of their
being sub- or Super-luminal. But non-dispersive wave packets can be of use also in
theoretical physics for a reasonable representation of elementary particles[33].

Within Extended Relativity since 1980 it had been found[34] that —whilst the
simplest subluminal object conceivable is a small sphere, or a point as its limit— the
simplest Superluminal objects results by contrast to be (see refs.[34], and Figs.6 and

7

7) an “X-shaped” wave, or a double cone as its limit, which moreover travels without
deforming —i.e., rigidly— in a homogeneous medium[3].
It is worth noticing that the
most interesting localized solutions happened to be just the Superluminal ones, and with a
shape of that kind. Even more, since from Maxwell equations under simple hypotheses one
goes on to the usual scalar wave equation for each electric or magnetic ﬁeld component,
one can expect the same solutions to exist also in the ﬁeld of acoustic waves, and of
seismic waves (and perhaps of gravitational waves too). Actually, such beams (as suitable
superpositions of Bessel beams) were mathematically constructed for the ﬁrst time, by
Lu et al.[35], in acoustics: and were then called “X-waves” or rather X-shaped waves.

It is more important for us that the X-shaped waves have been in eﬀect produced in
experiments both with acoustic and with electromagnetic waves; that is, X-beams were
produced that, in their medium, travel undistorted with a speed larger than sound, in
the ﬁrst case, and than light, in the second case.
In Acoustics, the ﬁrst experiment
was performed by Lu et al. themselves[36] in 1992, at the Mayo Clinic (and their pa-
pers received the ﬁrst 1992 IEEE award).
In the electromagnetic case, certainly more
“intriguing”, Superluminal localized X-shaped solutions were ﬁrst mathematically con-
structed (cf., e.g., Fig.8) in refs.[37], and later on experimentally produced by Saari et
al.[38] in 1997 at Tartu by visible light (see ﬁg.2 in ref.[38]!), and recently by Mugnai,
Ranfagni and Ruggeri at Florence by microwaves[39] (this being the paper appeared in
the Phys. Rev. Lett. of May 22, 2000, which the national and international press refer-
eed to). Further experimental activity is in progress, for instance, at Pirelli Cables, in
Milan (by adopting as a source a pulsed laser) and at the FEEC of Unicamp, Campinas,
S.P.; while in the theoretical sector the activity is even more intense, in order to build
up —for example— new analogous solutions with ﬁnite total energy or more suitable for
high frequencies, on one hand, and localized solutions Superluminally propagating even
along a normal waveguide[40], on the other hand.

Let us eventually touch the problem of producing an X-shaped Superluminal wave
like the one in Fig.7, but truncated —of course– in space and in time (by the use of a
ﬁnite, dynamic antenna, radiating for a ﬁnite time):
in such a situation, the wave will
keep its localization and Superluminality only along a certain “depth of ﬁeld”, decaying
abruptly afterwards[35,37]. We can become convinced about the possibility of realizing
it, by imaging the simple ideal case of a negligibly sized Superluminal source S endowed
with speed V > c in vacuum and emitting electromagnetic waves W (each one travelling
with the invariant speed c). The electromagnetic waves will result to be internally tangent
to an enveloping cone C having S as its vertex, and as its axis the propagation line x
of the source[3]. This is analogous to what happens for a plane that moves in the air
with constant supersonic speed. The waves W interfere negatively inside the cone C,
and constructively only on its surface. We can place a plane detector orthogonally to
x, and record magnitude and direction of the W waves that hit on it, as (cylindrically
symmetric) functions of position and of time.
It will be enough, then, to replace the
plane detector with a plane antenna which emits —instead of recording— exactly the

8

same (axially symmetric) space-time pattern of waves W , for constructing a cone-shaped
electromagnetic wave C that will propagate with the Superluminal speed V (of course,
without a source any longer at its vertex): even if each wave W travels with the invariant
speed c. For further details, see the ﬁrst one of refs.[37]. Here let us only add that
such localized Superluminal waves appear to keep their good properties only as long as
they are fed by the waves arriving (with speed c) from the dynamic antenna: taking
the time needed for their generation into account, these waves seem therefore unable to
transmit information faster than c; however, they have nothing to do with the illusory
“scissors eﬀect”, since they certainly carry energy-momentum Superluminally along their
ﬁeld depth (for instance, they can get two detectors at a distance L to click after a time
smaller than L/c).

As we mentioned above, the existence of all these X-shaped Superluminal (or “Super-
sonic”) seem to constitute at the moment—together, e.g., with the Superluminality of
It is curious
evanescent waves— one of the best conﬁrmation of Extended Relativity.
than one of the ﬁrst applications of such X-waves (that takes advantage of their prop-
agation without deformation) is in progress in the ﬁeld of medicine, and precisely of
ultrasound scanners[41]. A few years ago only, the hypothesis that “tachyons” could be
used to obtain directly 3-dimensional ultrasound scans would have arisen the scepticism
of any physicist, this author included.

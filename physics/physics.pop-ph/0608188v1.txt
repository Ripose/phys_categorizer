Abstract

The two major goals in fundamental physics are: 1) Uniﬁcation of all forces incorporating
relativity and quantum theory, 2) Understanding the origin and evolution of the Universe as
well as explaining the smallness of the cosmological constant.

Several eﬀorts have been made in the last few decades towards achieving these goals
with some successes and failures. The current best theory we have for uniﬁcation of all
forces is Superstring/M Theory. However current evidence suggests our Universe is ﬂat and
accelerating. A Universe with a positive cosmological constant will have serious implications
for string theory since the S-Matrix cannot be well deﬁned and Superstring/M Theory is only
formulated in ﬂat Minkowski background. Holographic principle provides a way out as shown
by the AdS/CFT and dS/CFT correspondence, but it remains to be proved if it is valid for
our non-conformal, non-supersymmetric Universe. Aside from the issue of deﬁning M-Theory
in a de Sitter background, why the cosmological constant is so small remains puzzling and
needs to be understood. The “cosmological constant problem” has brought physics to a
standstill towards any major development and remains currently the most disturbing issue.
Conventional big bang cosmology has not yet produced a satisfactory explanation of the
small value of the cosmological constant. An attempt by SuperString/M Theory in this
direction is given by the Ekpyrotic/Cyclic model.

The aim of this review is not to introduce any new concepts not already known, but give
an overview of current state of aﬀairs in high energy physics, highlighting some successes
and failures and making some few suggestions on areas to focus to resolve some of these
outstanding issues.

1 Introduction

Four fundamental forces exist in nature: The electromagnetic force, weak force, strong force
and gravitational force. The search for a uniﬁed description of diﬀerent phenomena has been
historically a guiding principle for the progress of physics. It therefore seems natural to search
for a theory unifying all four fundamental interactions. A more solid argument for the uniﬁcation
of fundamental forces is provided by the fact that the coupling constants of all four interactions
seem to converge at the grand uniﬁcation scale of about 1016GeV .

The standard model provides a quantum version of three of the forces and uniﬁes the electro-
magnetic and the weak force into electroweak theory. But there is no real deep uniﬁcation of the
electroweak and QCD (strong force). The force which is gravity is Einsteins classical theory of
relativity. Quantization of gravity has been very diﬃcult due to the nonlinear mathematics on
which Einstein based his theory. The nonlinear mathematics of general relativity clashes with the
requirement of quantum theory. A necessary condition for renormalizability is absence of negative
dimensional coupling constant, but the dimensional coupling of gravity is negative, hence it is
nonrenormalisable. The coupling constant grows stronger with energy and ultraviolet divergences
appear when we go to arbitrarily high energies and perturbative theory breaks down.

But is there a need for developing a quantum theory of gravity?. The answer is yes and the

reasons are:

Quantum Cosmology:

•

•

•

•

At low energies and large distances gravity is weak compared to the other forces but at
Planck scale energies (∼ 1019GeV ) and Planck scale distances (∼ 10−
33cm), which was the
state of our Universe at the big bang, gravity is strong and comparable to the strength of
the other forces. Thus quantum mechanics comes into play and a quantum description is
necessary.

Singularity Theorems:

In general relativity, singularities are unavoidable as proved by Hawking and Penrose. Thus
general relativity predicts its own breakdown. Experimental evidence from cosmic microwave
background radiation indicates that the Universe started from an initial singularity. This
singularity cannot be explained by Einstein’s classical theory of general relativity hence there
is a need for a quantum version.

Black Hole Information Paradox:

Hawking’s discovery of black hole radiation indicates a contradiction of quantum mechanics
and general relativity. General relativity suggest that not even light can get out of a black
hole horizon whilst quantum mechanics says we need the information inside the black hole.
Thus there is information loss and violation of unitarity. An indication of a possible non-
locality in physics. A full quantum theory must explain this puzzle.

Uniﬁcation of all interactions:

At present all non-gravitational interactions have been accommodated into a quantum frame-
work as presented by the Standard Model. Since gravity couples to all forms of energy as

2

stated by the equivalence principle, it is expected that in a uniﬁed theory of all interactions,
gravity must be quantized.

Ultra Violet Divergences:

Quantum ﬁeld theory is plaque with divergences. It is believed that at small distances (high
momenta) space-time is quantized and this divergences can be avoided

A correct quantum theory of gravity must, as listed in [3]:

Tell us whether the principles of general relativity and quantum mechanics are true as they
stand, or are in need of modiﬁcation.

Give a precise description of nature at all scales, including the Planck scale.

Tell us what time and space are, in a language fully compatible with both quantum theory
and the fact that the geometry of space-time is dynamical. Tell us how light cones, causal
structure, the metric, etc are to be described quantum mechanically, and at the Planck scale.

Give a derivation of the black hole entropy and temperature. Explain how the black hole
entropy can be understood as a statistical entropy, gotten by coarse graining the quantum
description.

Be compatible with the apparently observed positive, but small, value of the cosmological
constant. Explain the entropy of the cosmological horizon.

Explain what happens at singularities of classical general relativity.

Be fully background independent. This means that no classical ﬁelds, or solutions to the
classical ﬁeld equations appear in the theory in any capacity, except as approximations to
quantum states and histories.

Predict new physical phenomenon, at least some of which are testable in current or near
future experiments.

Explain how classical general relativity emerges in an appropriate low energy limit from the
physics of the Planck scale.

Predict whether the observed global Lorentz invariance of ﬂat space-time is realized exactly
in nature, up to inﬁnite boost parameter, or whether there are modiﬁcations of the realization
of Lorentz invariance for Planck scale energy and momenta.

•

Provide precise predictions for the scattering of gravitons, with each other and with other
quanta, to all orders of perturbative expansion around the semi-classical approximation.

Some of the main approaches toward the goal of developing a quantum theory of gravity are [6]

tum gravity.

later sections in this review).

The two leading theories in the search for a quantum gravitational theory are loop quantum

gravity and superstring theory.

Superstring theory appears to have an edge over loop quantum gravity as the current best
quantum gravity theory. In String theory gravity arises naturally as a ﬁeld with quanta called the
graviton. In addition to providing a quantum theory of gravity it also uniﬁes all four interactions
as opposed to loop quantum gravity which only provides a quantum gravity theory in four space-
time dimensions. String theory has made signiﬁcant progress on some of the listed requirements
above, such as statistical prediction of black hole entropy, and has many attractive features such as
prediction of supersymmetry, gravity, and extra dimensions. Also it has no adjustable dimension-
less parameters1. It also uniﬁes of all known interactions with absence of ultraviolet divergences
which makes it more predictive than conventional quantum ﬁeld theory.

For Superstring/M Theory to gain full acceptance as a theory giving a uniﬁed description of
nature and the fundamental forces, it must make testable predictions. Unfortunately the String
scale is ∼ the Planck scale and not accessible to current accelerators. However if supersymmetry
breaking occurs at ∼ 1T eV as suggested, then supersymmetry could be discovered at the LHC
at CERN. Discovering supersymmetry would give string theory a big boost showing that gravity,
gauge theory, and supersymmetry that arise from string theory in roughly the same way are all
part of the description of nature.

Recent development in cosmology indicate that it will be possible to use astrophysics to perform
tests of fundamental theory inaccessible to particle accelerators, namely the physics of the vacuum
and cosmic evolution.

The current best theory we have for explaining the evolution of our Universe is Inﬂationary/Big
Bang theory. This has however not provided a satisfactory explanation of the smallness of the
cosmological constant, one of the greatest challenges in physics today.

Superstring/M Theory has made some headway describing this cosmic evolution and proposing
a solution to the cosmological constant problem by providing the Ekrypotic/Cyclic model. This
postulates that our Universe resulted from collision of branes embedded in higher dimensions.
There are several evolutionary cycles with a collision occurring in each cycle. The cycle begins
with a big bang and ends with a big crunch. It explains that the smallness of the cosmological
1Parameters such as the string coupling are determined by the vacuum expectation value of moduli ﬁelds

constant as resulting from the dynamic relaxation of the potential of a quintessence scalar ﬁeld
whose ﬁeld value also determines the interbrane separation. The potential of this scalar ﬁeld
includes all quantum ﬂuctuations and this total value of potential reduces for every cycle of
evolution. However it has received some criticism from some authors that it is not an alternative
to inﬂationary theory but just another inﬂationary theory [10].

Increasing evidences from cosmology experiments have shown that our Universe is evolving
towards a pure de Sitter space-time. This poses a serious problem for Superstring/M Theory since
an S-Matrix cannot be well deﬁned for a de Sitter space-time.

In this review I will give a brief overview of the concepts behind string theory (see [1] for
detailed review) and then discuss issues related to the cosmological constant. I will then conclude
with a suggestion on areas that may lead to a solution of these major problems we are encountering
in physics.

String theory and Cosmology are increasingly becoming broad areas of research and it is
impossible to discuss everything into details in one review. Some topics may not be discussed into
details since the main goal of this work is to bring important ideas and developments into one
review manual to be easily accessible to the reader thus acting as a good reference source. It is
expected that the reader will consult the references for more detailed discussion.

2 Superstring/M Theory

Superstring theory is based on the idea that fundamental objects are not point particles as in
particle theories but one dimensional objects called strings. The diﬀerent vibration modes of the
fundamental string which could be either open (have Neumann or Dirichlet boundary conditions)
or closed (no boundary conditions), are what we call particles, and which from far look like point
particles. Anomaly cancellations leaves us with only ﬁve consistent superstring theories, each
living in ten space-time dimensions. These ﬁve theories are called Type I, Type IIA, Type IIB,
E8 heterotic. Type one contains only open strings whilst the others
SO(32) heterotic, and E8 ×
contain both open and closed strings (see Table 1).

In open superstring theories the Hilbert space breaks into two sectors: a Ramond(R) sector with
periodic wave functions and Ramond boundary conditions and a Neveu-Schwartz(NS)sector with
anti-periodic Neveu-Schwartz boundary conditions. After GSO projection all space-time bosonic
states arise from the NS sector e.g the eight massless photon states arising from a Maxwell gauge
ﬁeld, and all the space-time fermionic states arise from the R sector. The ground states in closed
superstrings theories are constructed by tensor products of eight left-moving coordinates of the
leading to four
(NS or R) sector with a eight right-moving coordinates of (NS or R) sector.
sectors NS-NS and R-R which are bosonic states and NS-R, R-NS which are fermionic states.
NS-NS massless ﬁelds comprises of the graviton gµν, the Kalb-Ramond ﬁeld Buv and the dilaton
Φ. Together we have 128 massless bosonic states and 128 massless fermionic states as required by
supersymmetry. All massive states are a result of excitation of these ground states.

The NS-NS bosons of type IIA and type IIB theories are the same but the R-R bosons are
diﬀerent. In type IIA theory the massless R-R bosons include the Maxwell ﬁeld Aµ and a three-
index antisymmetric gauge ﬁeld Aµνρ. In type IIB theory the massless R-R bosons include a scalar
ﬁeld A, a Kalb-Ramond ﬁeld Aµν, and a totally antisymmetric ﬁeld Aµνρσ.

Heterotic superstrings are constructed from tensor products of 10 left-moving coordinates of
open bosonic string living in 26 space-time dimension, with 10 right moving coordinates of open
superstring living in ten dimensions. These results in a theory living ten dimensional space-time.

Enforcing absence of gravitational and gauge anomalies produces the gauge groups SO(32) and
E8 ×

By deﬁning strings as one dimensional objects worldlines of particle become world sheets
such that space-time is smeared out and there are no singular interaction points thus ultraviolet
divergences found in ﬁeld theories are avoided. To avoid tachyons (negative mass states) in the
spectrum, string theory requires supersymmetry, a space-time symmetry relating fermions and
bosons. And for consistency a ten dimensional space-time.

In string theory one replaces Feynman diagrams with stringy ones and space-time is not re-
ally needed. One just needs two-dimensional ﬁeld theory describing the propagation of strings.
Whereas in ordinary physics one talks about space-time and classical ﬁelds it may contain, in
string theory one talks about an auxiliary two-dimensional ﬁeld theory that encodes the informa-
tion. A space-time that obeys its classical equations corresponds to a two-dimensional ﬁeld theory
that is conformally invariant2 [4].

In the eﬀective description of string theory, i.e at scales below the Planck scale the massive
string states are integrated out since they do not propagate. Thus we are left with only massless
modes. The bosonic part of the eﬀective action is the given by [5]:

2.1 Compactiﬁcation, Dualities and D-branes

Our world is four dimensional with broken supersymmetry thus the only way for superstring theory
to provide a realistic theory making contact with our world is by compactiﬁcation of the extra six
dimensions and breaking down of supersymmetry.

There are several methods of compatiﬁcation: toroidal, orbifolds and orientifolds. The simplest
case is toroidal (compact space is a torus) compactiﬁcation which is the same as Kaluza-Klein
compactiﬁcation in ﬁeld theory which attempts to unify gauge interactions and gravity. Curling
up a spatial dimension into a circle leads to the spectrum of closed strings having two components:
their momentum along the circle is quantized in the form n/R, where n is an integer, and winding
states wα,/R due to wrapping of the string around the circle m times, where R is radius of
compactiﬁcation, and w is called the winding number.

The presence of extra-dimensions would not be detected directly if the size of the compact
33cm3. After compactiﬁcation of the six dimensions, our space-time becomes
space is of order 10−
M, where M4 is our four dimensional Minkowski space-time and M is the compact space.
M4 ×
Each point in the non-compact space then becomes associated with a tiny ball of six-dimensional
space.

Compactiﬁcation on T 6 preserves too much supersymmetry, but we speculate some minimal
supersymmmetry to exist in our 4 dimensional world at energy scales above 1 TeV. Most choices
of M will not yield a consistent string theory since the associated two-dimensional ﬁeld theory
M-
which is now most appropriately described as a non-linear sigma model with target space M4 ×
will not be conformally invariant.

To preserve the minimal amount of supersymmetry N=1 in 4 dimensions, we need to compactify
on a special kind of 6-manifold called a Calabi-Yau Manifold. A Calabi-Yau Manifold is a complex
manifold which admits a metric gµν whose Ricci tensor Rµν vanishes. The problem is that there
are many Calabi-Yau manifolds each with diﬀerent physics on M4 and not knowing which is the
right one to choose leads to lost of predictive power.

Compactiﬁcation leads to larger degrees of freedom and to several new stringy phenomena
such as: winding states, enhanced gauge symmetries, dualities and D-branes. When the ﬁve
consistent string theories are compactiﬁed on an appropriate manifold from their ten dimensional
space-time, several diﬀerent string theories emerge in lower dimensions. Each of these theories is
parameterized by a set of parameters known as moduli4.

4In string theory these moduli are related to vacuum expectation values of various dynamical ﬁelds and are

expected to take deﬁnite values when supersymmetry is broken

8

Inside the moduli space of the theory there is a certain region where the string coupling
is weak and perturbation theory is valid. Elsewhere the theory is strongly coupled and thus
nonperturbative.

(the shaded region) and a strong coupling region of a second theory and vice versa. This is an
example of String-string duality

Examples of duality symmetries are: T-duality and S-duality, and String-string duality.

2.1.1 T-duality

T-duality (or target space duality) transformation maps the weak coupling region of one theory
to the weak coupling region of another theory or the same theory (see Figure 3.).

Heterotic string theory compactiﬁed on a circle of radius R is dual to the same theory com-

pactiﬁed on radius R−
circle of radius R is dual to IIB string theory compactiﬁed on a circle of radius R−
value of the coupling constant.

The physics when the circle has radius R is indistinguishable from the physics of a circle of
radius α,/R. As R
, winding states become inﬁnitely massive, while compact momenta
goes to a continuous spectrum as with the non-compact dimensions. For the case of R
0, the
states with compact momentum become inﬁnitely massive but the spectrum of winding states now
approaches a continuum5.

Thus as the radius goes to zero the spectrum again seems to approach that of a non-compact
dimension. This implies limits R
are physically equivalent. For open strings,
in the limit R
0, strings with Neumann boundary conditions have no comparable quantum
number to w. Thus states with nonzero momentum go to inﬁnite mass, but no new continuum of
states.

2.1.2 S-duality

S-duality or self duality gives an equivalence relation diﬀerent regions of the moduli space of the
same theory. It maps the weak coupling regime of one string theory to the strong coupling region
of the same theory, see Figure 4.

This duality was ﬁrst conjectured in the context of compactiﬁcation of heterotic string to four
dimensions [11]. It has also been found that Type II B superstring in ten dimensions is S-dual to
itself [12].

5It does not cost much energy to wrap a string around a small circle

Fig. 4. A representation of the moduli space of a self-dual theory. The weak and strong coupling
regions of the same theory are related by duality.

For both the heterotic and Type IIB string theories the transformations acts via an element of
SL(2,Z) on a complex scalar λ, whose imaginary part’s VEV is related to the coupling constant
of the string theory (gs ∼

e<Φ>) [13].

2.1.3 String-string duality

This is a duality relation between diﬀerent string theories in a way that the perturbative regime
of one theory is equivalent to to the non-perturbative regime of the other i.e we have a mapping
between the elementary excitations of one theory to the solitonic excitations of the other theory
and vice versa. Examples are [13]:

Het on T 4

IIA on k3

↔

Het with gauge group SO(32) in d=10

I in d=10

In general the duality can relate not just two theories but a whole chain of theories as illustrated

in Figure 5.

representation. In each case the shaded region denotes the weak coupling region.

2.2 D-branes

When an open string theory is compactiﬁed on a small torus, the physics is described by a com-
pactiﬁcation on a large torus but with the open string endpoints restricted to lie on subspaces.
These subspaces or hyperplanes are dynamical objects called Dirichlet membrane or D-brane.
Thus by taking compactiﬁcation and taking the limits R
0 and T-duality transformations we
have interchanged Neumann boundary conditions with Dirichlet boundary conditions resulting
in appearance of nonperturbative objects called Dp-branes in a non-compact space, where p is
number of its space dimensions [1]. Strings carry electric “charge” by coupling directly to NS-NS

→

13

tensor Bµν, but couple only to the ﬁeld strengths of R-R ﬁelds and not their potentials, thus are
R-R neutral. However Dp-branes couples to R-R ﬁelds and thus complements string theory with
nonperturbative states6 carrying R-R charges.

D-branes are BPS states i.e belong to the short multiplet representation. In supersymmetric
theories, BPS states are stable objects i.e are invariant under a subset of supersymmetry trans-
formations as the string coupling changes from small to large, i.e moving from perturbative to
non-perturbative region. Dp with p=-1 are called D instanton, D0-brane is a zero dimensional
object, D-string is a one dimensional brane, D2-brane is called a membrane. The standard models
particles are conﬁned on D-branes. Dp-branes are p-branes with Dirichlet boundary conditions
on which open strings can end.

Dp-branes couple to p+1 dimensional objects which gives the charge. D-branes are hodge dual
to NS ﬁve branes which are their magnetic dual and have magnetic charges. Type IIA theories
have RR gauge ﬁelds Aµ, Aµνρ and Aµνρσλ and hence couple to D0-branes, D2-branes, D4-branes
etc. Type IIB has R-R gauge ﬁelds A, Aµν, and Aµνρσ so they couple to D(-1)-branes, D1-branes,
D3-branes. Tension on a D-brane is given by T ∼ 1/gs, where gs is the string coupling. Thus in
the strong coupling limit D-branes become light objects. D-branes are dynamic objects on which
open strings live on. The action for D-brane is given in Appendix A.

We gain insights into non-perturbative eﬀects in string theory by ﬁnding the BPS states of

perturbative string theory. This shows the usefulness of D-branes.

Discovery of D-branes has made a remarkable impact in String theory, some of which are:

6For nonperturbative objects such as D-branes and their magnetic dual, NS Branes, the interaction amplitude
varies inversely to the string coupling and given by A
s respectively. The masses also vary in
the same way. Thus as we go to strong coupling, they become light objects. This inverse variation of the amplitude
with string coupling allows us to have meaningful values of their interaction probabilities.

2.3 M-theory

The ﬁve consistent string theories were thought to be far to many for a theory that is suppose
to be unique and unifying all forces. A second string revolution started around 1995 with the
discovery of duality symmetries. This allowed string theories to be extended beyond perturbative
expansion to probe nonperturbative features. The three major implications of these discoveries
were [7]:

•

•

Dualities relate all ﬁve superstring theories in ten dimensions to one another.

The diﬀerent theories are just perturbative expansions of a unique underlying theory U
about ﬁve diﬀerent, consistent quantum vacua. The implication is that there is a complete
unique theory of nature, whose equation of motion admits many vacua.

The theory U also has a solution called “M-Theory” which lives in 11 space-time dimensions

The low-energy limit of M-Theory is 11-dimensional supergravity. All ﬁve superstring theo-
ries can be thought of as originating from M-Theory (see Figure. 6). The underlying theory
U is shown in Figure 7.

•

In addition to the fundamental strings, the theory U admits a variety of extended nonper-
turtabive excitations called “p-branes”.

In the low energy limit, the various superstring theories are described by supergravity theories.
The low-energy eﬀective theory of Type IIA string theory is ten dimensional Type IIA supergravity
and the low energy limit of Type IIB string theory is Type IIB supergravity. D-branes can be
found as solutions to Type II string and massive supergravity theories [5]. Type IIA supergravity
can also be obtained by dimensional reduction of supergravity in eleven dimensions.

The eleven dimensional supergravity multiplet contains the following massless ﬁelds: a metric
GM N , a three-form potential A3 with components AM N P and a Majorana gravitino ΨM . It has a
total of 256 degrees of freedom (dofs); 128 bosonic and 128 fermionic.

Compactiﬁcation to ten dimensions not only results massless modes forming a supermultiplet
with 256 states but also massive Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes. Thus each massless mode has a
corresponding Kaluza-Klein massive mode. With a given compactiﬁcation radius R11, the KK
modes have momenta n/R(g)

M-theory describes IIA superstring which have D0, D2, D4, D6 and D8 branes as well as
fundamental string (F1 brane). Since M-Theory contains a third-rank gauge ﬁeld AM N P it must
have a 2-brane to which the gauge ﬁeld couples. The dual potential of this gauge ﬁeld has rank 6,
and thus couples to a 5-brane7. Thus in M-Theory we expect to have a 2-brane and a 5-brane in
addition to the gravitino, and the three-form potential, M-theory .

For M-theory to make contact with our four dimensional world, 7 extra dimensions would
have to be compactiﬁed with preservation of some supersymmetry. One can get 4d N=1 theories
from M-Theory by compactifying on a 7-manifold of G2 holonomy [24]. The ﬁrst example of a
Kaluza-Klein compactiﬁcation with non-trivial holonomy was provided by the squashed S7 which
has G2 holonomy and yielded N=1 in D=4 space-time [26, 27]. Examples of such theories have
been studied [25] but not much is known about their physics.

Despite these eﬀorts in String/M-Theory compactiﬁcations, no complete quantitative agree-
ment has been found with the various elementary particles of the standard model such as the
masses.

Over the past few years development of M-Theory has lead to many useful insights in physics

some of which are:

Matrix models [14]

AdS/CFT correspondence [15]

Here I give a brief review of the Matrix Model and the AdS/CFT Correspondence.

2.3.1 Matrix Model

The matrix model by Banks, Fischler, Shenker and Susskind (BFSS) is a conjecture that states
that M-Theory in the light cone frame (inﬁnite momentum frame), is exactly described by the
large N Limit of a particular supersymmetric matrix quantum mechanics [23].

As stated in the previous section, M-Theory is the strong coupling limit of Type IIA string
theory The KK states of the eleven dimension supergravity corresponds to bound states of N D0-
branes. The D0 branes are point particles which carry a single unit of RR charge and longitudinal

7A rank (p+1) gauge ﬁeld couples to a p-brane.

It hodge dual is a gauge ﬁeld with rank-(D-p-3) and thus
couples to a D-p-4-brane. D is the full target space-time dimensions in which the brane propagates, p is the space
dimension of the brane.

18

momentum P11 = 1/R. D0 branes carry the quantum numbers of the ﬁrst massive KK modes of
the basic eleven dimensional supergravity multiplet, including 44 gravitons, 84 components of a
3-form and 128 gravitinos. Collectively all three types are called supergravitons.

From Appendix A, we know that a collection of N Dp-branes is described by ten dimensional
N hermitian matrix quantum
U(N) super Yang-Mills theory reduced to p+1 dimensions, i.e N
mechanics. For p=0, a collection of N D0 branes can be described by dimensional reduction of ten
dimensional U(N) super Yang-Mills theory reduced to 0+1 dimensions. The action is given by:

What the BFSS theory is then saying is that in the limit N

(large collection of Dp-branes
with gauge theory U(N)), the above equation becomes M-Theory in the light cone frame. To prove
this we must ﬁrst deﬁne M-Theory in the Inﬁnite Momentum Frame (IMF) or Light Cone Frame
(LCF).

→ ∞

For a collection of particles, IMF is deﬁned to be a reference frame in which the total momentum

P, is very large. All individual momenta can be written as

pa = ηaP + pa
⊥

with pa

.P = 0,

pa

ηa = 1.

implying the observer is moving with high velocity in the -P direction. For suﬃciently large

Before proceeding with the prove it is worth noting that inﬁnite momentum frame could also
be interpreted as the light cone frame since they are similar. And here is the similarity: In the

Considering M-Theory in the IMF, we separate the components of the eleven dimensional

momenta as follows: p0, pi, i = 1, ....9 and p11.

19

We then boost in the 11th direction to the IMF until all pa

11 become positive. The eleventh
dimension x11, is then compactiﬁed on a circle of radius R. This results in the quantization of all
momenta pa

X
The above equation exhibits the non-relativistic structure we saw in eq 11. At this point we
have M-Theory in an inﬁnite momentum frame with full Galilean invariance in the transverse
dimensions.

We have pointed out previously that KK modes appear after compactiﬁcation and are the
Dp-branes in IIA superstring. The RR photon that couples to a D0-brane in the IIA superstring
is the KK photon that results from compactifying x11 on S1 of radius R with the RR charge
corresponding to p11.

A single D0-brane carries one unit of RR charge and thus is given by p11 = 1/R. It ﬁlls out a
whole supermultiplet of 256 states. Since in eleven dimensions it is massless (graviton multiplet),
in ten dimensions it is BPS saturated. There are also KK states with p11 = N/R, N being an
arbitrary integer. N¿1 are bound states of N D0-branes, while N < 0 corresponds to anti-DO-
branes or bound states8. As mentioned earlier, taking the total p11 to inﬁnity to reach the IMF
limit, leaves only positive p11, i.e N > 0. This means M-Theory in the IMF should only contain
D0-branes and their bound states. The anti-D0-branes get boosted to inﬁnite energy and have
somehow implicitly been integrated out.

So now we have arrived at our M-Theory (in IMF) being described by D0-branes quantum
mechanics. The membranes (i.e 2-branes) and 5-branes in M-Theory can also be described within
the D0-brane quantum mechanics [22].

Restating the BFSS conjecture: M-Theory in the IMF is a theory in which the only dynamical
degrees of freedom are D0-branes each of which carries a minimal quantum of p11 = 1/R. This
action is described by the eﬀective action for N D0-branes which is a particular N
N matrix
quantum mechanics, to be taken in the N

limit.

Though M-theory has had some setbacks as a true uniﬁed theory of nature one successful area
is the accurate counting of microstates (entropy) for certain highly supersymmetric black holes
saturating the Bogomolnyi-Prasad-Somerﬁeld (BPS) bound by Stominger and Vafa [21].

2.3.2 AdS/CFT Correspondence

Anti-deSitter space-time is the maximally symmetric solution of Einstein’s equations with a neg-
ative cosmological constant Λ < 0. The metric satisﬁes the Einstein equations with Λ < 0. A
pure anti-deSitter is one in absence of matter ﬁelds i.e the vacuum solution. It is the the most
symmetric space-time with negative curvature.

8Note that DO-branes with RR charge 1/R = KK massive modes is compactiﬁed M-Theory with RR charge
1/R. The RR are the gauge photons in both cases. In M-Theory they originate from compactifying the metric
tensor. Note that the KK massive modes are the massive modes of the graviton and gravitino i.e the metric in 10D

20

In a remarkable development, Maldacena (1997) conjectured that the quantum ﬁeld theory
that lives on a collection of D3-branes (in the IIB theory) is actually equivalent to Type IIB string
theory in the geometry that the gravitational ﬁeld of the D3-branes creates.

The duality in its full form is stated as:

“Four-dimensional N = 4 supersymmetric SU(Nc) gauge theory is equivalent to IIB string

theory with AdS5 ×

S5 boundary conditions.”

Maldacena arrived at this conjecture by considering a stack of Nc parallel D3-branes on top of
each other. Each D3-brane couples to gravity with a strength proportional to the dimensionless
string coupling gs, so the distortion of the metric by the branes is proportional to gsNc. When
gsNc ≪
1 the spacetime is nearly ﬂat and there are two types of string excitations: 1) open strings
on the brane whose low energy modes are described by a U(Nc) gauge theory and 2) close strings
away from the brane. When gsNc ≫
1, the back-reaction is important and the metric describes
an extremal black 3-brane. Near the horizon the spacetime becomes a product of S5 and AdS5.9
String states near the horizon are strongly red-shifted and have very low energy as seen asymp-
In a certain low energy limit, one can decouple these strings from the strings in the
totically.
asymptotically ﬂat region. At weak coupling gsNc ≪
1, this same limit decouples the excitations
of the 3-branes from the closed strings. Thus the low energy decoupled physics is described by
S5 closed string theory at large gs. The simplest
the gauge theory at small gs and by the AdS5 ×
conjecture is that these are the same theory as seen at diﬀerent values of the coupling10. The fact
that very diﬀerent gauge theory and gravity calculations were found to give the same answers for
a variety of string-brane interactions is quite remarkable.

3 Cosmic Evolution

On cosmological scales, a description of our Universe on the symmetries of homogeneity and
isotropy,11 leads to the Robertson-Walker metric as a solution of the Einstein ﬁeld equation:

Gµν = 8πGTµν,

Rµν −

gµνR = 8πGTµν.

where gµν is the space-time metric and R is the Ricci scalar curvature. Tµν is a stress energy
tensor describing the distribution of mass in space, G is Newton’s gravitational constant and the
Einstein Tensor Gµν is a complicated function of the metric and its ﬁrst and second derivatives.
9This is directly analogous to the fact that near the horizon of an extremal Reissner-Nordstrom black hole, the

spacetime is AdS2

11Homogeneity implies the same at every point, i.e translational invariant. Isotropy implies the same in every
direction, rotational invariant. The implication of the homogeneity and isotropy is what we call the Cosmological
Principle

where the scale factor a2(t) describes the relative size of spacelike hypersurfaces at diﬀerent
times and contains all the dynamics of the Universe, k is a constant describing the curvature of
space: k =0 for ﬂat hypersurfaces (ﬂat Universe), k = -1 for negatively curved hypersurfaces (open
Universe), and k = +1 for positively curved hypersurfaces (closed Universe).

If the contents of the Universe is modeled as a perfect ﬂuid with density ρ, and pressure p, the

stress-energy tensor is given by:

where U u is the four-velocity of the ﬂuid12.

Tµν = (ρ + p)UµUν + pgµν

The equation of state relates the pressure p and the density ρ of a ﬂuid by, p = ωρ. This is
a simple equation of state satisﬁed by most ﬂuids. Note that the second derivative of the scale
factor depends on the equation of state of the ﬂuid. For ω > 0, the pressure will be positive and
¨a < 0 (expansion will decelerate), whilst for ω < 0, ¨a > 0 and we have accelerated expansion.

An expanding and cooling Universe leads to a number of predictions: the formation of nuclei
and the resulting primordial abundances of elements, and the later formation of neutral atoms and
the consequent presence of a cosmic background of photons, the cosmic microwave background
(CMB). A clear picture of how the Universe evolved to this present time is given as:

3.1 Big/Bang Model

The Big-Bang Model of the Universe explains that the Universe started as a hot bowl of soup from
a singularity with inﬁnite density and temperature and it is expanding and cooling with time. This
Model is based on the observation of cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) [29] and the
observed expansion of the Universe by Edwin Hubble. Measurement of CMB also suggest a ﬂat
Universe (Ω = 1).

±

Observation of the ﬁrst acoustic peak, ﬁrst accomplished with precision by the Boomerang [30]
and MAXIMA [31] experiments, indicate that the geometry of the Universe is ﬂat, with Ωtotal =
1.02

0.05 [32].

However this success of the standard Big Bang leaves us with a number of disturbing puzzles.
In particular, how did the Universe get so big, so ﬂat, and so uniform?. This is the ﬂatness
and horizon problem. These observed characteristics of the Universe are poorly explained by the
standard Big Bang model and needed something to make it ﬁt the data: This new model is called
Inﬂation, discovered by Alan Guth in 1980 [33].

3.1.1 Inﬂation

Within the context of a standard matter or radiation dominated Universe, the ﬂatness and horizon
problems have no solutions simply because gravity will curve spacetime causing a decelerating in
the expansion and an eventual collapse to a singularity. Though invoking initial conditions that
the Universe started out ﬂat, hot and in thermal equilibrium, could resolve the horizon and ﬂatness
problem, it is not a satisfactory explanation. There need to be an explanation of why these initial
conditions existed. This explanation was found by Alan Guth in his Inﬂational model. Inﬂation is
the idea that at some very early epoch, the expansion of the Universe was accelerating instead of
decelerating. It is evident from the Friedman equation below that the condition for acceleration
¨a > 0 is that the equation of state be characterized by negative pressure, 1 + 3ω < 0.

This means that the Universe evolves toward ﬂatness rather than away. In accelerated expan-

sion, physical distance d between the two points increases linearly with the scale factor, d
1. This implies
The horizon size13 is proportional to the inverse of the Hubble parameter dH ∝
that two points that are initially in casual contact (d < dH) will expand so rapidly that they will
eventually be casually disconnected. Thus accelerating expansion provides a tangible resolution
to the horizon and ﬂatness problems. The Inﬂationary theory thus remains up to date the best
theory for cosmic evolution.

4 The Cosmological Constant

General relativity together with cosmological principle leading to the Friedman equations ( 18
19), shows that space-time is dynamic and the Universe is not static but either expanding or
contracting. In order to get a static Universe to match with reality14, Einstein introduced the
cosmological constant to modify his ﬁeld equation ( 15). This cosmological constant provides an
opposing force to gravity and thus holding the Universe closed and static. He arrived at this by
noticing that by adding a constant Λ to the stress energy tensor Tµν, the conservation equation

which is an equivalence to charge conservation in electromagnetism,

remains invariant, i.e:

DµT µν = 0,

∂µJ µ = 0,

DµT µν = Dµ(T µν + Λgµν) = 0.

+ 3H(ρ + p) = 0.

For a homogeneous ﬂuid the stress energy tensor is given by eq. 26, and stress energy conser-

vation takes the form of the continuity:15

[34],

Adding a constant term Λ to the ﬁeld equation implies adding a constant energy density to

the Universe, which from the continuity equation, eq. 32, implies negative pressure, pΛ =

ρΛ.

−

The Einstein ﬁeld equation in presence of matter then becomes:

13The horizon size of the Universe is how far a photon can have traveled since the Big Bang
14It was thought at that time that the Universe was static
15The continuity equation relates the evolution of the energy density to its equation of state p = ωρ.

The Friedman equations are then modiﬁed to be:

These equations admit a static solution as Einstein wanted, called “Einstein static Universe”

with positive spatial curvature k =+1, and all parameters ρ, p, and Λ nonnegative [35].

Discovery of an expansion of the Universe by astronomer Edwin Hubble in 1920 showed that
the Universe is not static, implying no need for a cosmological constant. This is what Einstein
famously called his “greatest blunder”. As Einstein also famously quoted “If there is no quasi-static
world, then away with the cosmological term”. Classical it is okay to remove the cosmological term
but quantum mechanically it is diﬃcult due to quantum corrections. Anything that contributes
to the energy density of the vacuum acts just like a cosmological constant.

Thus the cosmological constant turns out to be a measure of the energy density of the vacuum

(the state with lowest energy). The energy-momentum tensor of the vacuum is given by:

where its energy density ρvac, is related to the cosmological constant by:

Thus the eﬀective cosmological constant Λef f given by:

where Λb is the bare cosmological constant and Λvac = ρvac8πG is the cosmological constant

due to the vacuum.

The question now is; where does this vacuum energy or zero point energy come from?. Quantum
mechanics predicts the existence of what are usually called ”zero-point” energies for the strong,

the weak and the electromagnetic interactions, where ”zero-point” refers to the energy of the
system at temperature T=0, or the lowest quantized energy level of a quantum mechanical system.
In conventional quantum physics, the origin of zero-point energy is the Heisenberg uncertainty
principle, which states that, for a moving particle such as an electron, the more precisely one
measures the position, the less exact the best possible measurement of its momentum, and vice
versa. This minimum uncertainty is not due to any correctable ﬂaws in measurement, but rather
reﬂects an intrinsic quantum fuzziness in the very nature of energy and matter springing from
the wave nature of the various quantum ﬁelds. This leads to the concept of zero-point energy.
Zero-point energy is the energy that remains when all other energy is removed from a system.
These vacuum ﬂuctuations are real and demonstrated by the Casimir eﬀect [37].

How do we then calculate this energy?: A free quantum ﬁeld can be thought of as a collection

of an inﬁnite number of harmonic oscillators, with Hamiltonian

where ˆa and ˆa† are the lowering and raising operators, respectively, with commutation relation

[ˆa, ˆa†] = 1. The results in a stack of energy eigenstates

where the index k is the momentum, and ωk is the angular frequency at that momentum.
Thus we see that the ground state energy diverges. However, if one should assume that general
relativity holds true up to the Planck scale, mP I ∼ 1019GeV , one may introduce a momentum
cutoﬀ at this scale. The ground state energy then becomes ﬁnite. The cosmological constant Λvac

Recent astronomical evidence starting in 1997 Type I Supernovae [39], WMAP [40], Boomerang [30],

where ρb = Λ0/8πG, and Λb is the bare cosmological constant. Thus there is a huge discrep-
ancy of about 120 orders of magnitude between the measured energy density and the theoretical
prediction. Note that even if we set the cut oﬀ scale at 1 TeV (the supersymmetry breaking
scale) the diﬀerence is still huge; of 59 orders of magnitude. And even if we only worry about
zero-point energies in quantum chromodynamics, we would expect ρvac to be of order Λ4
QCD/16π2,
6GeV 4, requiring Λb/8πG to cancel this term to about 41 decimal places [38]. An incredible
or 10−
amount of ﬁne-tuning.

This is the “Cosmological Constant Problem”, currently the most challenging issue in physics
yet to be resolved. Not only do we want to understand why the cosmological constant is small
but also why it is not exactly equal to zero and why is its energy density today of about the same
order of magnitude as the matter energy density. Thus what Einstein called his greatest blunder
has turned out to be his greatest insight.

A number of attempts have been made at resolving the cosmological constant puzzle. However
no clear cut solution has yet been found. The approaches to resolving this puzzle can be divided
into ﬁve main categories [42]:

Fine-tuning

Here I discuss a few of these attempts:

4.1 Fine-tuning

The bare cosmological constant can be adjusted by hand to match the observed data. However
this will involve an incredible amount of precision tuning. Assuming we set the energy scale at I
TeV, a precision tuning to an order of 59 decimal places is needed. For the Planck scale a tuning of
order of 120 decimal places is needed. The smallest deviation from this tuning will aﬀect structure
formation in the Universe. This tuning method is thus not well accepted in Physics.

4.2 Supersymmetry

Supersymmetry (SUSY) is a space-time symmetry relating bosons to fermions. Supersymmetry
is associated with “supercharges” Qα, where α is a spinor index [43, 44]. This is analogous to
ordinary symmetries which are associated with conserved charges.

I begin by looking at globally supersymmetric theories. In SUSY, the Hamiltonian is related

to the supercharges by:

H =

Qα, Q†α,

α

tions and that of a scalar potential V16.

To calculate the eﬀective energy of the vacuum, we need to sum energy from vacuum ﬂuctua-

ψ >= 0, for all α, i.e the vacuum state, the

In supersymmetry we expect equal number of bosons and fermions. The quantum corrections
to the vacuum coming from bosons are of the same magnitude but opposite sign compared to that
of the fermions and the two eﬀects cancel each other. Thus in supersymmetric theories the energy
from vacuum ﬂuctuations is zero. For the scalar ﬁeld, the potential is given as a function of the
superpotential W (φi) and is given by:

V (φi, φ

) =

where ∂iW = ∂W/∂φi. Unbroken SUSY only occurs for values of φi such that ∂iW = 0,

state in a globally supersymmetric theory vanishes.

However in supergravity theories the scalar ﬁeld potential V, does not only depend on the

In an unbroken supersymmetry the Kahler derivative is zero hence the potential is negative,
and thus the eﬀective cosmological constant is negative when gravity is added in supersymmetric
theories.

16A scalar ﬁeld has the same symmetries as that of the vacuum

(47)

(48)

(49)

(50)

We can then conclude that the vacuum state in an unbroken supersymmetric theory has zero

or negative energy, Λ

0.

≤

In summary, if our world is supersymmetric then the vacuum energy will be expected to be
zero or negative. However no supersymmetric partners of the Standard Model particles has yet
been found and hence we expect supersymmetry to be a broken symmetry below 1 TeV, implying
a large vacuum energy. Thus supersymmetry does not help us in solving the cosmological constant
problem.

There is however a nice suggestion by Witten [57] that in a 2+1 space-time dimensions one
can have supersymmetry of the vacuum (and thus Λ = 0) without supersymmetry of the spectrum
i.e no Bose-Fermi degeneracy for particles. If this is true, the implication is that we can ﬁnd a
nonsupersymmetric string vacua with zero cosmological constant.

4.3 Quintessence

The idea of quintessence is that the acceleration of the Universe is driven by a dynamic ﬁeld, a
scalar whose value slowly changes with time. Thus the cosmological constant is small because
the Universe is old. This idea of a scalar ﬁeld driving expansion ﬁts perfectly well with inﬂation
since we expect inﬂation to stop at some point which will imply a vacuum energy with a constant
value over all time will not be ideal in explaining cosmic evolution. The value of this scalar ﬁeld
is expected to be high at the time of inﬂation and has reduce to a constant small value at this
present epoch but still rolling down to its equilibrium vacuum point.

In a homogeneous Universe a scalar ﬁeld is a function of time only. One can imagine a a

uniform scalar ﬁeld φ(t) rolling down a potential V (φ) with energy density given by:

This implies that inﬂation (accelerated expansion) starts when the potential energy of the
scalar ﬁeld dominates its kinetic energy. The potential must be chosen such that it is ﬂat enough
for the scalar ﬁeld to roll slowly and have a minimum at which inﬂation can end. This strategy for
choosing the potential to behave this way is called the slow-roll approximation. Since the potential
dominates, eqns ( 56) and ( 57) can be approximated to:

And slow-roll parameters are deﬁned as [46]:

ǫ(φ) measures the slope of the potential and η(φ) measures the curvature. The necessary

4.4 Violation of the Equivalence Principle

The equivalence principle states that gravity couples to all forms of energy. Since high cosmolog-
ical constant value is expected than observed in the curvature and acceleration of the Universe,
it is speculated that probably vacuum energy in contrary to ordinary matter does not gravitate,
a violation of the equivalence principle. This situation would require modiﬁcation of general rela-
tivity. The vacuum energy would then decouple from gravity, and its relevance will be eliminated
and there would be no need to worry about the cosmological constant. It is also speculated that
the large missen vacuum energy could possibly be the cause of curvature of the extra dimensions.
In this case there is no violation of the equivalent principle17. An example of this is found in
Braneworld models such as the Randall-Sundrum models which is discussed below:

4.5 Randall-Sundrum Models, Warped Extra Dimensions

The general idea is that our world is conﬁned on a hypersurface, a brane, embedded in a higher
dimensional space-time. The standard model ﬁelds are restricted to live on a 3-brane, while only
gravitons can propagate in the full higher dimensional space.

There are two Randall-Sundrum models, RS-I and RS-II. I will start with the RS-I model. In
this model there are two branes 3-branes located at separate distances in a ﬁve dimensional space
which is a foliation with four dimensional Minkowski slices. The ﬁfth dimension is compactiﬁed
on an orbifold S1/Z2, and the 3-branes are located at the orbifold ﬁxed planes (atφ = 0andφ = π),
where φ is the extra ﬁfth dimension called the bulk.

One brane called the “hidden brane” has positive tension, while the other one, the “visible
brane”, on which we are supposed to live, has negative tension. Both could have gauge theories
living on them. All of the standard model ﬁelds are localized on the brane, and only gravity can
propagate through the entire higher dimensional space.

The action is given by [5]:

Sb1 and Sb1 are the actions on the branes. The action in the bulk space is given by:

We assume that the ﬁelds being localized on the brane are in the trivial vacuum and take into

brane actions read

where the indices M,N = 0,..4, and Mp is the ﬁve dimensional Planck mass, which has to satisfy
M & 108GeV , in order not to spoil Newtonian gravity at distances l . 0.1mm. With the above
assumptions for the brane-tensions and bulk CC, it can be shown that there exists the following
static solution, with a ﬂat 4D-metric:

ds2 = exp−|

φ

/L ηµνdxµdxν + dφ2

The warp factor in the above equation leads to suppression of all masses on the visible brane
in comparison to their natural value. This is used as an explanation for the hierarchy problem.
An example is given by the higgs mass:

m2 = exp−

φ0/L m2
0

a small hierarchy in φ0/L results in a large hierarchy between m and m0, resolving the hierarchy

problem.

The second model is RS-II; here the extra dimensions can be kept large, uncompactiﬁed, but
warped and there is only one brane. In this scenario the size of the extra dimensions can be inﬁnite,
dφ√G, is still ﬁnite. The warp-factor causes the graviton wavefunction to be
but their volume
peaked near the brane, or, in other words, gravity is localized, such that at large 4D-distances
ordinary general relativity is recovered.

4.6 Statistical Approach

4.6.1 Anthropic Principle

The idea behind the anthropic principle is that the parameters we call constants of nature may in
fact be stochastic variables taking diﬀerent values in diﬀerent parts of the Universe, and the values
of the parameters we observe are determined by chance and by anthropic selection. Taking the
cosmological constant for an example; the value observed by any species of astronomers will be
conditioned by the necessity that this value of ρV should be suitable for the evolution of intelligent
life. There is a range for which some of these constants must lie to support life. This range is
called the anthropic bound. Given a parameter X, its range to support life may be given as:

Xmin < X < Xmax

(74)

Values of X outside the interval are not going to be observed, because such values are incon-

sistent with the existence of observers. This is the “anthropic principle” [38], [48].

Thus we measure a small value of the cosmological constant because it is the ideal value to
support life. Any value higher will not lead to structure formation in our Universe and hence life
and we will not be present to observe it. From string theory point of view anthropic principle
will imply that there exist a moduli space of supersymmetric vacua called supermoduli space [50].
Moving around on this moduli space is accomplished by varying certain dynamic moduli. These
moduli are scalar ﬁelds which determine the size and shape of the compact internal space, and each
have their own equations of motion. Thus there is only one theory but many solutions characterized
by the values of the scalar ﬁeld moduli. The value of the potential energy of the scalar ﬁeld at the
minimum is the cosmological constant for that vacuum. In unbroken supersymmetry, the moduli
ﬁelds have zero potential at their minima but once supersymmetry is broken there can be several
minima. Thus there is a landscape of string vacua with diﬀerent cosmological constants one of
which is our own.

4.6.2 Quantum cosmology

Hawking suggested that state vector of the Universe could be taken as a superposition of states
with diﬀerent values Λef f with a huge peak at zero [60].

The wave-function of the Universe Ψ, is obtained by a Euclidean path-integral over all metrics

gµν and matter ﬁelds φ, deﬁned on a 4-manifold M4 [38].

S =

√g(R + 2Λef f ) + matter terms + surf ace terms

(76)

Diﬀerent Universes with diﬀerent values of Λef f contribute to this path integral. The proba-

bility P, of observing a given ﬁeld conﬁguration will be proportional to [59]:

where S is the action taken at its stationary point to evaluate the path integral and MP is the
Planck’s mass. This probability peaks at Λef f = 0. The issue of whether this really solves the
cosmological constant problem has been raised by Weinberg [38].

∝

This Euclidean path integral approach may also help to resolve the issue of not being able
to deﬁne an S-Matrix in a de Sitter space-time as we will see in the later sections. Hawking’s
argument was that any consistent theory of gravity should involve an appropriate integral over
all topologies(trivial and non-trivial)The trivial one being Minkowski space-time. Since Euclidean
path integral over the non-trivial topologies (eg de Sitter space-time) gives non-unitary contri-
butions and hence information loss, it results to the scattering amplitude decaying exponentially
with time. This leads to unitary contributions from only the trivial topologies [61].

4.6.3 Λ-N correspondence

A proposal towards the solution of the cosmological constant problem was made by Banks [55]
who conjectured that the cosmological constant should not be viewed as an eﬀective parameter
to be derived in a theoretical framework like quantum ﬁeld theory or string theory, but instead
determined as the inverse of the number of degrees of freedom, N, in the fundamental theory.

The argument towards this approach was laid as follows-:

A black hole has an event horizon and its entropy is bounded by the area of the event horizon

given by Bernstein-Hawking’s formula:

where A is the surface area, GN is Newton’s gravitational constant

and a temperature given by:

where M is the mass of the black hole. Any entropy calculation inside the black hole should
Information on the surface of the black hole is

be bounded above by the area of the surface.

a projection of what is going on inside the black hole, a form of holography or what is called
UV-correspondence. Quantum mechanical calculation of the entropy given by:

S

ln(N)

∼

(80)

where N is the number of microstates or degrees of freedom, gives a good agreement with the

classical value in 78. This implies a bound on the number of degrees of freedom.

A dS space-time has a cosmological event horizon. Any observer in an asymptotically dS space
(AsdS) only sees a ﬁnite portion of the Universe bounded by a cosmological event horizon. Hence
making an analogy between black hole and a dS space-time we may deduce that a dS has a ﬁnite
entropy given by the above relationship. This implies entropy or number of degrees of freedom in
a dS space-time is bounded by the area of the horizon. Thus an asymptotically de Sitter Universe
can be described by a ﬁnite number of states, given by the Bernstein-Hawking formula stated
above.

Now relating the cosmological constant to N, implies a bound on the cosmological constant.

This is the central idea of Banks proposal which states that:

“The Bernstein-Hawking Entropy of Asymptotically de Sitter (AsDS) spaces represents the
logarithm of the total number of quantum states necessary to describe such a Universe. This
implies that the cosmological constant is an input to the theory rather than a quantity to be
calculated ” [55].

We know that the structure of AsdS Universe automatically breaks SUSY. The expected SUSY

breaking scale is given by:

MSU SY ∼ MP (Λ/M 4

P )α

(81)

where Λ is the eﬀective cosmological constant and MP is Planck’s mass. There exist a good
agreement between the observed SUSY breaking scale from experiment and the value obtained
from eq. 47 provided the value of the exponent α is 1/8 rather than its classical value 1/4. This
leads to the question of why isn’t the scale of SUSY breaking related to the cosmological constant
by the standard classical SUGRA formula, which (without ﬁne tuning) predicts MSU SY ∼ Λ1/4.
A suggestion by Banks is that this is attributed to the eﬀect of large virtual black holes via the
UV/IR correspondence in M-Theory [55].

A summary of this conjecture stated by Banks as follows:

“The structure of an AsdS Universe automatically breaks supersymmetry (SUSY). From this
point of view, the “cosmological constant problem” is the problem of explaining why the SUSY
breaking is so much larger than that associated in classical supergravity (SUGRA) with the ob-
served value of (bound on ?) the cosmological constant.”

Summarizing in other words: In the presence of a cosmological constant Λ, the Universe tends
to evolve towards a pure de Sitter space18 with ﬁnite entropy S = N = 3π/Λ, given by the area
a−4 respectively and thus the matter energy density
a−3, ρm ∝
18Note that matter and radiation density ρm ∝
gets diluted and tending towards zero as the Universe expands whilst the vacuum energy density stay constant.
Thus we see the Universe becoming asymptotically de Sitter with time.

36

N correspondence asserts that a Universe with positive Λ has
of the cosmic horizon. This Λ
degrees of freedom N = 3π/Λ. But to make this theory testable a bound is placed on the number
of degrees of freedom. Thus the entropy an AsdS Universe cannot exceed N = 3π/Λ, called the
N-bound.

N correspondence does not solve the cosmological constant problem but rather gives a new
insight in physics given as the N-bound on the entropy of a positive Λ Universe and its inverse
relation to Λ [56].

5 String Theory & Cosmology

An accelerating Universe implies a de Sitter space-time. A de Sitter space-time will have serious
implications for string theory. The reason being that the only well deﬁned observable in string
theory is the S-Matrix which is deﬁned from negative inﬁnity to positive inﬁnity in ﬂat space-
time. However a de Sitter space-time has a cosmic horizon and the killing vectors are not globally
deﬁned over all space-time. They are only deﬁned within the horizon. This implies a violation of
unitarity and S-Matrix cannot be deﬁned. Let me digress a little on it or look at at in another
perspective: For a black hole, an asymptotic observer lying far outside the horizon will see thermal
radiation coming from the horizon. Information coming out as thermal radiation from the black
hole is mangled leading to quantum decoherence and thus we have Hawking’s “Information lost
paradox”. In this scenario, an initially pure quantum state will be observed as a mixed state by
the asymptotic observer. Unitariy is violated and S-Matrix is not well deﬁned. This situation
is similar to the dual dS case except the observer is inside the cosmic horizon and is immersed
in a thermal bath of quantum radiation from the cosmic horizon. This is the situation we face
developing a quantum gravity theory in a de Sitter space-time 19

19There is non-unitarity evolution of quantum states of matter in Black hole and dS space-time

Three suggested ways out of this problem are:

•

The implication is that the rolling scalar ﬁeld has not yet reached its equilibrium energy
which is expected to be zero. Implying a vanishing of the cosmic horizon at the vacuum
point and S-Matrix will then be deﬁned.

dS/CFT Correspondence:

An S-Matrix is deﬁned in AdS space-time. The AdS/CFT correspondence, a holographic
principle conjecture by Maldecena, relates the CFT theory on the boundary of AdS space-
time to the gravity theory. Boundary correlators in AdS space-time have been found to
relate with the correlators of local gauge invariant conformal ﬁeld theory (CFT) ﬁelds. But
our Universe is not AdS (negative cosmological constant) but dS, based on current evidence.
A dS/CFT correspondence by [51] has shown relation of correlation functions of string
theory in dS space-time and CFT. This holographic principle, averts the “Information loss
paradox” leading in a big step to a formulation of a quantum theory of gravity. But it may
not be valid for the non-conformal and non-supersymmetric case, which is the realistic one
we want for our Universe [61].

Then then leads us to ﬁnding a framework for deﬁning strings in non-conformal backgrounds,
such as our dS Universe. The theory behind this is called non-critical or Liouville string.

38

Noncritical (Liouville) string Framework

•

The main idea behind noncritical (Liouville) string framework is identifying the Liouville
mode with target time. By doing so, non-conformal backgrounds and positive Λ can be
accommodated in string theory. I will not discuss this framework here. See [58] for more
details.

Conventional big bang cosmology has not yet produced a satisfactory explanation of the small
value of the cosmological constant. An attempt by String/M Theory in this direction is given by
the Cyclic model. I give a brief discussion of this model below.

6 Ekpyrotic/Cyclic Model

In this model the Universe undergoes a periodic sequence of expansion and contraction. Each
cycle begins with the Universe expanding from a “big bang”, a phase which involves a period
of radiation, matter and dark energy(quintessence) domination, followed by an extended period
of cosmic acceleration at low energies which is the current epoch we are observing before ﬁnally
contracting to a big crunch. The cycle then begins again after the big crunch. The cosmic
acceleration phase which follows the radiation and matter dominated phase is a crucial epoch in
which the Universe approaches nearly vacuous state and restores itself to the initial vacuum state
conditions before each big crunch by removing the entropy, black holes, and other debris produced
in the preceding cycle. This allows the cycle to repeat making it an attractor solution.

This cyclic model is based on ideas drawn from the ekpyrotic model [52] and M-theory. The
ekpyrotic model explains the Universe as beginning from collision of branes in a 5D bulk space
approaching each other along the ﬁfth dimension. According to the ekpyrotic model we live at one
of the two heavy 4D branes called boundary branes in a 5D Universe described by the Horava-
Witten (HW) theory [53], where our brane is called the visible brane and the second brane is called
the hidden. This is similar to the prescription in Randal-Sundrum model discussed previously,
but in addition there is also a ’light’ bulk brane at a distance Y from the visible brane in the 5th
direction. The bulk brane moves toward our brane and collides with it. The residual kinetic energy
carried by the bulk brane before the collision then transforms into radiation which is deposited in
the three dimensional space of the visible brane. The visible brane, now ﬁlled with hot radiation
begins to expand as a ﬂat FRW Universe.
In this model the issues of homogeneity, isotropy,
ﬂatness, and horizon of the Universe do not appear since the three branes are assumed to be
initially in a nearly stable BPS state which is homogeneous.

The cyclic model is an improved version of the ekpyrotic model. The inter-brane distance is
parameterized by a four-dimensional scalar ﬁeld, φ20. In this scenario the source of the dark energy
or the cosmological constant which causes the cosmic acceleration is the inter-brane potential
energy from the scalar ﬁeld. For more detailed review of the cyclic model see [54].

7 Conclusions

Though String/M Theory has not fulﬁlled all the requirements stated earlier for a full quantum
theory of gravity it has made some interesting discoveries that may be useful in the ﬁnal quantum
theory. The AdS/CFT correspondence has shown that it is possible to relate a gauge theory to
a gravitational theory, and counting of black hole microstates seems to agree with the classical
calculations. Increasing evidence has shown that our world is asymptotically de Sitter, leading to
problems in deﬁning an S-Matrix. Attempts have been made to ﬁnd a dS/CFT correspondence
but there is doubt if it is applicable in a realistic case of a non-conformal Universe like our own.
However there is a suggested solution by using non-critical (Louisville) strings. The critical issue
in this model is the identiﬁcation of the Liouville mode with target time.

The Λ-N correspondence by Banks does not solve the cosmological constant problem but oﬀers
a new perspective, i.e a bound on the entropy of a dS space-time. If it is true, the implication is
that M-theory only arises in the limit where the cosmological constant vanishes and N is inﬁnite.

Cosmology provides a unique opportunity for string/M Theory to justify its claim as the
best quantum theory. Attempts to explain the small value of the cosmological constant within
conventional big bang cosmology has proven to be very diﬃcult and up to date no clear cut
explanation without ﬁne-tuning exist. The Cyclic model from a string theory point of view appears
to be very promising despite some criticism by some physicists that it is not an alternate inﬂation
theory but just another inﬂationary theory.

Not having a natural explanation for the vanishing or extreme smallness of the cosmological

constant will remain a key obstacle for any further progress in particle physics.

Suggestion by Witten that in a 2+1 space-time dimensions one can have supersymmetry of
the vacuum (and thus Λ = 0) without supersymmetry of the spectrum, is a very interesting area
to look further into. If it is possible to extend this to four space-time dimensions the cosmological
constant puzzle may be resolved. Another very interesting approach is the Euclidean path integral
suggested by Hawking. If it is true, it will solve both the cosmological constant problem as well
as the non-unitarity of S-Matrix problem in de Sitter space-time as ours. Since space-time is
dynamic it may be possible that our Universe has evolved or on its way to evolving through all
topologies and thus we living and observing21 its asymptotically de Sitter evolution stage. Thus
the wavefunction should really be an integral over all topologies. But a rigorous mathematical
formulation is needed to support this, and certainly an area worth focusing on.

The dualities relations between diﬀerent string theories on diﬀerent string vacus (space-time
backgrounds) is a strong indication that a background independent theory might exist. Eﬀorts are
needed to be made towards this goal, though we may be far from understanding the foundations
of this background independent theory22.

21This certainly runs into the anthropic principle
22A background independent theory is an immense task and we may be far from it. However loop quantum
gravity is background independent but does not unify the forces. The question is whether uniﬁcation is really
needed, in which case loop quantum gravity should do the trick, or if we should extract some information from
loop quantum gravity into string theory, or whether we need to merge string theory with it to get the ﬁnal theory.
I have no clue to this. Only time and some serious eﬀorts will tell.

40

These eﬀorts towards uniﬁcation though haven’t yet proved successful has generated a lot of
insights in physics such as, the holographic principle, the N-bound on entropy, etc. These may be
useful and form part of the ﬁnal uniﬁed theory when discovered.

8 Appendix A

By world-volume and space-time re-parametrization invariance of the theory, we may choose the
“static gauge” in which the world-volume is aligned with the ﬁrst p+1 space-time coordinates,
leaving 9-p transverse coordinates. This amounts to calling the p+1 brane coordinates ξa = xa, a =
0, 1, ...p. By this choice the full dynamics of the D-brane can be given by the Dirac-Born-ﬁeld
action:

To show that the ten-dimensional gauge theory action eq. 87 reduces to the expansion eq. 86

2πα, xm (m=p+1,......10.)24, to depend only on the p+1 brane coordinates
xia, and be independent of the transverse coordinates xp+1, ....x9. This requires the identiﬁcation

Note that above equation are for a single brane giving a U(1) abelian theory. For multi-
ple D-branes, one can derive a non-abelian U(N) extension of the Dirac-Born-Infeld action and
incorporating supersymmetry.

The general theory is stated as:

“ The low-energy dynamics of N parallel, coincident Dp-branes in ﬂat space is described in
static gauge by the dimensional reduction to (p+1)-dimensions of N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills
theory with gauge group U(N) in ten space-time dimensions.”

The ten dimensional action is given by25:

ﬁeld degrees of freedom, and eight fermionic degrees of freedom [7].

Let us follow the previous example in the U(1) case to see how to construct a supersymmetric
Yang-Mills gauge theory in p+1 dimensions by dimensional reduction from eq. 89. By the same

approach, we take all ﬁelds to be independent of the coordinates xp+1, ....x9. Then the ten-
dimensional gauge ﬁeld Aµ splits into a (p+1)-dimensional U(N) gauge ﬁeld Aa plus 9-p Hermitian
scalar ﬁelds P him = 1
2πα′ xm in the adjoint representation of U(N). The Dp-brane action is thereby

where a, b = 0,1......,p, m, n = p+1,....,9 with no explicit display of the fermionic contributions.
Thus the brane dynamics is described by a supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on the Dp-brane
world-volume, coupled dynamically to the transverse, adjoint scalar ﬁelds Φm with Φm representing
the ﬂuctuations of the branes transverse to their world-volume.

The Yang-Mills potential in eq. 92, which is given by:

(95)

A vacuum solution of the equations of motion requires minimization of the potential. In an
unbroken supersymmetric case this potential should be zero. Vanishing of the potential in eq. 93,
requires the condition:

V (Φ) =

[Φm, Φn] = 0

for all m,n and at each point in the (p+1)-dimensional world-volume of the branes.

One can deduce that at lower energies (larger distances) space-time is commutative and the
matrices Φm are simultaneously diagonalizable, giving the positions of the individual D-branes
from their spectrum of eigenvalues, whilst at higher energies (short distances) space-time is non-
commutative and the positions of the D-brane cannot be well deﬁned, a result of the uncertainty
principle.

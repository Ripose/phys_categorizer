Atmospheric refraction is responsible for the bending of light-rays in the atmosphere. It is a result
of the continuous decrease in the refractive index of the air as a function of altitude. A well-known
consequence of this phenomenon is the apparently elliptic shape of the setting or rising Sun (or
In the present paper we systematically investigate this phenomenon in a standard
full-Moon).
atmosphere. Theoretical and numerical calculations are compared with experimental data. The
asymmetric rim of the Sun is computed as a function of its inclination angle, observational height
and meteorological conditions characterized by pressure, temperature and lapse-rate. We reveal and
illustrate some extreme and highly unusual situations.

I. ATMOSPHERIC REFRACTIONS

Atmospheric refraction is between the ﬁrst scientiﬁ-
cally approached phenomenon. This eﬀect is responsible
for the apparent scintillation of stars, mirages, the puz-
zling and spectacular green ﬂash, diﬀerence between ap-
parent and real position of stars or the asymmetric rim of
the Sun near the horizon. The refractive index of dry air
is very close to 1. Its small dependence on temperature
and pressure leads to a refractive index gradient in the
atmosphere. Although this gradient is very small, due to
the large distances travelled by the light-rays in the at-
mosphere, it can result observable bending or dispersion.
Atmospheric refraction is usually divided into three
categories: astronomical, terrestrial and geodesic. Ter-
restrial refraction appears when both the object and ob-
server are within the Earth’s atmosphere. This refraction
is responsible for ordinary mirages, and has been exten-
sively studied [1]. The ﬁrst one reporting and account-
ing for mirages was Aristotle in Meteorologica [2]. Cor-
rectly, he concluded that dense air layers can act as mir-
rors, and considered this eﬀect responsible for mirages.
(A complete historic and bibliographic study of mirages
can be found on the splendid web-page of A.T.Young
[3].) Geodesic refraction is a special case of terrestrial
refraction where both the object and observer are at low
altitudes. A well-known example for this is surveying.
We speak about astronomical refraction when a terres-
trial observer detects ray-bending eﬀects for the light-
rays coming from objects outside the Earth’s atmosphere.
This refraction is responsible for the diﬀerence between
the real and apparent position of stars near the horizon,
the green ﬂash or the asymmetric rim of the setting (or
rising) Sun.
In the present paper we discuss in detail
the ﬂatness of the Sun or full-Moon near the horizon.
Particularly, we are interested in the extreme values this
ﬂatness can take for standard atmospheric proﬁles, and
the dependence of the ﬂatness on the altitude of the ob-
server and meteorological conditions (temperature and
pressure). A similar study, considering ﬁxed atmospheric

conditions was recently published by Thomas and Joseph
[4]. Here we plan a more complete analysis, considering
three diﬀerent theoretical methods, experiments, com-
puter simulations and illustration of the results with a
collection of pictures and movies.

The spectacular nature of sunset or sunrise makes the
phenomenon attractive to students. After our experience
it can eﬀectively be used to exemplify refraction phenom-
ena and exercising the principles of geometrical optics.
Our paper is structured as follows. First, we introduce
the atmosphere model, and the refractive index proﬁle
is given. Then, we present three diﬀerent methods for
computing the ray-path in this atmosphere. Results com-
puted for diﬀerent meteorological conditions and observa-
tion altitude will close the theoretical part. Experimen-
tally, we analyze and compare with theory the measured
ﬂatness for some sunsets photographed or video-ﬁlmed
by us. Finally, we discuss some extreme and unusual
conditions which are exempliﬁed by pictures and movies
on a web-page supporting this study. From this web-
page one can also freely download a computer-program
written by us, which visualizes the sunset for arbitrary
meteorological conditions and observation altitude.

We emphasize here, that our study is restricted to stan-
dard atmospheric conditions with smooth temperature
and pressure proﬁle. Non-standard, but often encoun-
tered atmospheric proﬁles leads to non-standard distor-
tions of the solar rim, and are not considered within this
study.

II. THE OPTICAL ATMOSPHERE MODEL
(REFRACTIVE INDEX AS A FUNCTION OF
ALTITUDE)

The atmosphere of the Earth is composed mainly of N2
(79%) and O2 (20%), and extends up to a few hundreds
kilometer height. The refractive index of air is very close
to 1, and depends slightly on its pressure and temper-
ature following Edlen’s semi-empirical law [5], valid for

dry air:

T

.

In the above formula ν is the wave-number of the light in
cm−1, P is the pressure in kP a and T the temperature
in K. Since the pressure and temperature varies within
the atmosphere, we get a refractive index gradient which
is responsible for atmospheric refractions. Although the
variations in n are quite small, the large distances trav-
elled by light-rays in the atmosphere makes refraction
eﬀects observable and sometimes important.

FIG. 1. Distinct layers of the atmosphere, and the standard

temperature and pressure proﬁle.

As a function of altitude several layers with diﬀerent
physical properties are distinguishable. The lowest layer
extending from sea-level to approximative zt = 14km
height is called the troposphere. This is the region where
the wheatear takes place, i.e.
the region of rising and
falling packets of air. In this layer the air pressure drops
drastically, at the top of the troposphere being only 10%
of the value measured at sea-level. In the troposphere the
temperature decreases almost linearly with the altitude
(Fig. 1). A thin buﬀer zone between the troposphere and
the next layer (the stratosphere) is called the tropopause.
Within the tropopause the temperature is in good ap-
proximation constant. The stratosphere extends from the
altitude of approximately 18km up to zs = 50km (Fig. 1).
Within the stratosphere the air ﬂow is mostly horizontal.
In the upper part of the stratosphere we have the ozone
layer. Inside the stratosphere the pressure decreases fur-
ther with the altitude, but surprisingly the temperature
increases with height. Above the stratosphere we ﬁnd
the mesosphere and the ionosphere. In these regions the
air is very rare and the temperature proﬁle is shown in
Fig. 1.

From the viewpoint of atmospheric refractions only the
ﬁrst two layers, the troposphere and the stratosphere are
important. In the upper layers of the atmosphere the air
is so rareﬁed, that the refractive index can be considered
1 within a good approximation.

An accepted and widely used model for the atmosphere

2

is the U.S. Standard Atmosphere, established in 1953
and re-actualized in 1976 [6]. The U.S. Standard At-
mosphere consists of single proﬁles, representing the ide-
alized steady-state atmosphere for moderate solar activ-
ity. The listed parameters include temperature, pressure,
density, gravitational acceleration, mean particle speed,
mean collision frequency, mean free path, etc. as a func-
tion of altitude. In our study we consider an atmosphere
model with a spherical symmetry, all relevant physical
quantities (temperature and pressure) varying only as a
function of altitude. We then calculate the refraction in-
dex of air as a function of altitude as follows:
(i) The temperature proﬁle in the troposphere is linearly
decreasing with a λ = 6.5K/km lapse-rate, as suggested
by the U.S. Standard Atmosphere. Following again the
U.S. Standard Atmosphere we consider the temperature
constant within the tropopause. Although the temper-
ature increases as a function of altitude in the strato-
sphere, due to the rareﬁed air (small pressure) the re-
fractive index is close to 1, and for the sake of simplicity
we assume the temperature as constant in this region,
too. (We checked that this approximation is fully jus-
tiﬁed.) Above zs = 50km height we assume that the
refractive index is 1, and do not calculate it anymore by
Edlen’s formula. Up to the top of the stratosphere the
temperature proﬁle is therefore presumed as

T (z) = T0 − λz f or z < zt
T (z) = T0 − λzt f or zt ≤ z ≤ zs,

(2)
(3)

where z is the altitude from sea-level, and T0 the tem-
perature at sea-level.
(ii) For the pressure proﬁle we use a barometric formula
in which we take into account the variation of tempera-
ture with altitude. Considering a vertical slice of air with
thickness dz, the variation of pressure within this slice is
due to the hydrostatic pressure

dP = −ρ(z) g(z) dz,

where g(z) is the gravitational acceleration and ρ(z) the
density of air at height z:

ρ(z) =

=

=

P (z)m
kT (z)

.

(We denoted by m the mass of one molecule, N the num-
ber of molecules in volume V , T (z) the temperature at
height z and k the Boltzmann constant.) Since we fo-
cus on the troposphere and the stratosphere only, the
z height is small in comparison with the radius of the
Earth (RE ≈ 6378km), thus the g gravitational acceler-
ation can be considered constant. We can write thus

(4)

dP = −

which is a separable diﬀerential equation for P (z). Inte-
grating this between a height z0 where the pressure is P0

and an arbitrary height z, we get the desired barometric
formula:

This method closely follows the one discussed by Smart
[7]. To illustrate the method we use the geometry from
Fig. 3.

Considering z0 = 0 (sea-level) and using the temperature
proﬁle given by equation (2) and (3) a simple calculus
leads us to

for zt ≤ z ≤ zs. Plugging this and (2)-(3) in Edlen’s
formula (1), we get for the troposphere and stratosphere
the variation of the refractive index as a function of al-
titude. As stated before, for altitudes higher than zs we
can merely use n = 1. The refractive index proﬁle as
a function of altitude calculated in this manner for the
parameters of the U.S. Standard Atmosphere is plotted

III. TRAJECTORY OF A LIGHT-RAY IN THE
ATMOSPHERE

We present now three diﬀerent methods for computing
the path of a light-ray in our optical atmosphere model.
We proved that the results given by these methods are
the same, justifying our forthcoming theoretical consider-
ations. None of these methods is purely analytical, they
all make use of numerical calculations to derive the light-
ray trajectory. In the following we brieﬂy describe these
methods and sketch how one can compute the deviation
angle due to atmospheric refraction for light-rays coming
from distant sources. In order to avoid the phenomenon
of dispersion let us ﬁrst consider monochromatic light.

FIG. 3. Real (Sr) and apparent (S) position of a distant
source S, as observed from the point M within the Earth’s
inner atmosphere.

An observer in M (at altitude z0) detects the light-
source placed in Sr (altitude z′). Let the arc SrM be the
presumed path of the light-ray between the Sr source and
the observer in M . The observer detects the light ray in
the M S direction, which is tangent to the ray path in
M . The source will be positioned by the observer in S
(SO and SrO have radial directions, thus the light-rays in
these directions would not bend within our optical atmo-
sphere model). We denote by δ the apparent inclination
angle, characterizing the direction of the S image. Let
δdev be the deviation angle of M S relative to the real
M Sr direction of the source. The meaning of the θ and
θr angles are obvious from the ﬁgure. We are now inter-
ested to compute δdev as a function of δ. Presuming that
z′ >> z0 (i.e. the source is very far from the Earth),
we can approximate M S, M Sr and OS by z′. Some el-
ementary geometry will convince us that the following
approximations are justiﬁed:

In order to get the desired δdev(δ) dependence we need
θr as a function of δ.

Let us follow now a light-ray approaching the Earth
and let us consider the atmosphere stratiﬁed in inﬁnites-
imally thin layers of thickness ∆r, with slightly diﬀerent
refractive indices (Fig. 4).

A useful relation between the initial incident angle α0
(in layer with refractive index n0) and a later incident
angle αk (for a layer with refractive index nk) can be
derived. Using Snell’s law and the notations from Fig. 4,
we can write:

The above integral can be only numerically computed.
There is of course a singularity at z = z0, which can be
eliminated by a Gauss-Chebisev expansion, or by adjust-
ing the step in the numerical integration in the vicinity
of the singularity (the method followed by us). Comput-
ing numerically θr as a function of δ and by getting from
(10) θ as a function of δ, we are able now to calculate
from (11) the desired δdev(δ) dependence.

It is important to mention here that applying the
method for δ < 0 is not straightforward. One must ﬁrst
ﬁnd in this case the closest point C of the light-ray tra-
jectory relative to the Earth’s surface. This can be done
by using the fact that the trajectory is symmetric in the
vicinity of this point. Then, we decompose the trajec-
tory in two parts, the ﬁrst part is from M to C, and
the second from C to Sr. The light-ray can be followed
now by the presented methods both on the CSr and CM
segments. The deviation angle can be also computed.

B. Using the Fermat principle

The Fermat principle states that light travels between
two point along that path which requires the least time,
as compared to other nearby paths. We can of course re-
formulate the Fermat principle by using the optical path
instead of time. If the trajectory of a light-ray travelling
in the X −O −Y plane is described by the y = y(x) curve
(see the geometry in Fig. 5), we have that:

We are looking now for the y(x) function that minimizes

(36)

Taking the n(z) refractive index proﬁle from our opti-
cal atmosphere model, equation (36) can be numerically
integrated. We start from a Pini(x0, y0) point and con-
sider a tan δ = y′(x0) initial derivative. The angle δ
will be the apparent inclination angle of the light-ray
in Pini (the point where the observer is presumed). The
y(x) trajectory can be computed by numerically integrat-
ing (36) with the y(x0) = y0 and y′(x0) = tan δ initial
conditions. We construct thus the y(x) trajectory from
point-to-point, up to an altitude z ≥ zs, where n(z) = 1
can be presumed. The derivative of y(x) at this point
will determine the δr angle of the light-ray at the bor-
der of the optical atmosphere. For altitudes higher than
this, the trajectory of the light-ray is presumed recti-
linear. The deviation angle is then simply approximated
as δdev = δ − δr, and the desired δ(δdev) dependence can
be numerically computed.

C. The simulation method

As its name suggests this is simply a computer sim-
ulation method in which we follow the light-ray by seg-
ments of inﬁnitesimally small and ﬁxed-length lines. The
angle between two elementary line is given by estimat-
ing the refractive index at their end-points and by using
Snell’s law. The trajectory of the light-ray is then con-
structed starting from the observer with an initial angle
δ, and computing the ray-path from point-to-point until
it leaves the optical atmosphere and the refractive index
can be taken as 1. At this point the direction of the

light-ray determines the ﬁnal angle δr, and the deviation
is computed as δdev = δ − δr. Resembling the method
based on the Fermat principle, this simulation also works
smoothly for arbitrary positive or negative δ values. Due
to the fact that for an elementary step the changes in the
refractive index is rather small, it is crucial to work with
the maximal precision oﬀered by the computing environ-
ment.

We mention here that all three methods give identi-
cal results, proving their applicability and our theoretical
considerations. As an example, for the parameters of the
U.S. Standard Atmosphere, results for the δdev deviation
angle versus the apparent inclination angle, δ, is plot-
ted on Fig.6 (T0 = 100C, P0 = 1atm = 101.3kP a, ν =
20000cm−1 wave-number for the light and λ = 6.5K/km
lapse-rate).

These results are in excellent agreement with the one
given by Thomas and Joseph [4] and the report of the
U.S. Naval Observatory (1993) [9]. From Fig. 6 we learn
that the deviation angle is usually quite small, and be-
comes important only when viewing objects in the vicin-
ity of the optical horizon. The deviation angle increases
sharply for very small inclination angles. This eﬀect is re-
sponsible for the ﬂattened shape of the rising (or setting)
Sun and Moon, and also for the fact that these heavenly
objects appear more ﬂattened at their bottom. It is also
interesting to note here that the angular extent of the
Sun and full-Moon is 32 arcmin, and the maximum de-
viation obtained for standard conditions is 34.5 arcmin.
This leads us to the observation that the Sun or Moon
is visible even when in reality it is below the geometrical
horizon.

IV. COMPUTING THE FLATNESS

Once we numerically determined the δdev deviation an-
gle as a function of the δ apparent inclination angle, it
is easy to characterize the apparently ﬂat rim of the set-
ting Sun. Atmospheric refraction inﬂuences only the ∆v
vertical angular extent of the Sun (or Moon), which be-
comes thus smaller than the ∆h horizontal extent. The
asymmetry ratio (or the ﬂatness) for the rim of the Sun
can be described by the

α =

∆h
∆v

,

(37)

ratio (of course α ∈ [1, ∞)). Since both the Sun and the
full-Moon are normally visible under a ∆0 = 32 arcmin
angular extent, we have ∆h = ∆0. The value of ∆v can
be derived after numerically computing the δ apparent
inclination angle as a function of the δr = δ + δdev real
inclination, i.e. δ = F (δr). If the apparent inclination
angle for the bottom of the Sun is δ0, corresponding to a
δr0 real inclination angle, than

∆v(δ0) = F (δr0 + ∆0) − δ0,

(38)

and we get:

α(δ0) =

∆0
F (δr0 + ∆0) − δ0

(39)

For ﬁxed observation altitude and meteorological condi-
tions the αc maximal possible ﬂatness corresponds to the
situation when the bottom of the Sun touches the hori-
zon. This happens for a δ0 = δc critical inclination angle.
By decreasing the δ angle in small steps, and apply-
ing the previously described methods for computing the
light-ray trajectory, both the δ = F (δr) function and δc
is numerically determined. In our calculations we have
chosen to decrease δ in steps of 0.010.

V. RESULTS

Applying the methods presented in the previous sec-
tions and our optical atmosphere model, we systemati-
cally computed the αc asymmetry ratio for the rim of
the setting Sun as a function of observational altitude
and meteorological conditions parameterized by pressure
and temperature. We have also shown that the value of
α is insensitive to details of the considered optical atmo-
sphere model, proving the stability of our results. In the
following we detail our ﬁndings. For all the calculations
we considered monochromatic light with wave-number of
ν = 20000cm−1, corresponding to the green color. If oth-
erwise not speciﬁed we considered the height of the tro-
posphere zt = 14km and the height of the stratosphere
as zs = 50km.

A. Stability regarding the considered optical

the considered optical atmosphere model.

As discussed in section II.,

for the construction of
the refractive index proﬁle we borrowed results from the
U.S. Standard Atmosphere model. The main parameters
needed by us is the zt height of the troposphere, the zs
height of the stratosphere and the λ lapse-rate.

B. Asymmetry as a function of the inclination angle

We computed the observable α ﬂatness as function
of the apparent inclination angle of the Sun’s bottom.
Results for T0 = 00C, P0 = 1atm = 101.3kP a, λ =
6.5K/km and observations at sea-level are presented on
Fig. 9. As emphasized before, the asymmetric rim of
the setting (or rising) Sun becomes evident only for very
small δ0 values, when the Sun is close to the horizon. For
these normal parameters we get that αc is around 1.2.

C. Flatness as a function of observation height

Let us presume now that the observer is at height z0
above the sea-level, and there is no obstacle in the direc-
tion of the horizon, which is at sea-level (i.e. we are above
a vast ocean). It is obvious that from higher altitude the
δc critical angle will be smaller (becomes negative) and
the deviation angle increases more sharply in the neigh-
borhood of δc. This leads us immediately to the conjec-
ture that the observed ﬂatness should be larger. Taking
the T0 = 00C and P0 = 1atm normal atmospheric condi-
tions at sea-level, the standard λ = 6.5K/km, lapse-rate
we can compute the αc maximal observable ﬂatness as a
function of observation height. Results in this sense are
plotted in Fig. 10. As expected, αc increases with z0.
For these normal conditions we get that from the top of
a 5km height mountain we would observe an αc ≈ 1.5
ﬂatness and from a commercial ﬂight at 10km height at
sunset we would detect an αc ≈ 1.7 maximal ﬂatness.
For altitudes above 30km, or observations made from a
space-shuttle we can get extreme values for αc up to 2.5.

FIG. 8. Maximal observable ﬂatness, αc as a function of
the λ lapse-rate in the troposphere. (T0 = 00C, P0 = 1atm,
and observation from sea-level)

It is evident, that the exact value of zs does not much
inﬂuence our results, since in the stratosphere the refrac-
tive index is already very close to 1. As a ﬁrst step we
studied thus the inﬂuence of zt on the αc asymmetry ra-
tio. We considered normal conditions with T0 = 00C,
P0 = 1atm, observations at sea-level (z0 = 0) and
λ = 6.5K/km standard lapse-rate. As illustrated on
Fig. 7, the value of zt (in a reasonable range) has no
signiﬁcant inﬂuence (note the scale on the vertical axis).
The value of the lapse-rate has already a more noticeable
eﬀect on αc (Fig. 8), however this variation is also quite
small for the practically important ﬂuctuations around
the standard λ = 6.5K/km value. We conclude thus,
that our results are quite stable regarding the details of

The T0 temperature measured at sea-level inﬂuences in
an important manner the observed ﬂatness. Computing
the temperature dependence of αc for observations at
sea-level, normal P0 = 1atm atmospheric pressure and
standard lapse-rate we get the values presented in Fig. 11.
While for a T0 = 300C temperature αc is around 1.1 for
T0 = −400C it becomes 1.3, and increases more and more
sharply for lower temperatures (arctic conditions).

By simple experiments it is relatively easy to measure
the ﬂatness of the setting (or rising) Sun. We considered
photo and video experiments, and analyzed the pictures
as a function of the inclination angle of the Sun. With
an appropriate ﬁlter and calibrated eye-piece, telescope
observations were also possible. In order to obtain us-
able pictures with a nicely visible rim we had to ensure
a properly adjusted light intensity. Appropriate ﬁlters,
speciﬁc atmospheric conditions and usually small δ0 in-
clination angles lead us to usable pictures. When the
Sun is close to the horizon, the inclination angle of the
Sun can be directly determined by analyzing the taken
picture. We can use the fact that the horizontal angular
extent of the Sun always corresponds to 32arcmin. The
distance of the Sun from the horizon can then be com-
pared with the horizontal extent of the setting Sun and
the inclination angle results directly from the picture.
Making experiments with the setting or rising Moon is
more complicated, since one needs a full-Moon for this, a
work during the night and we have to deal with pictures
where the horizon is not clearly visible.

First, we have taken several series of pictures in South-
Bend (Indiana, altitude 100m) both in winter and late-
spring, studying very diﬀerent temperature conditions.
As an immediate conﬁrmation of our theoretical results,
from these pictures it was obvious that for the same incli-
nation angle the ﬂatness is bigger in winter, i.e. for lower
T0 values. Two series of digitized and appropriately en-
hanced pictures are visible on the web-page dedicated to
this study [10]. Results from these pictures, in compar-
ison with the expected (computed) ﬂatness is presented
on Fig. 13. The ﬁrst set of pictures is a sunrise in winter.
The mean temperature during the sunrise was −50C, and
the atmospheric pressure was 103kP a. It is important to
note that during this sunrise the temperature remained
approximately constant. The second set of picture was
made in late-spring for a sunset. During this sunset the
mean-temperature was 120C, the atmospheric pressure

E. Inﬂuence of atmospheric pressure

Increasing the P0 pressure at sea-level results the in-
crease of the observable αc ﬂatness. For the reasonable
and measurable P0 values, T0 = 00C, observation at sea-
level and standard lapse-rate the variation is almost lin-
ear (Fig.12). For an extreme P0 = 125kP a pressure one
can detect an asymmetry ratio of 1.3.

height between the bottom of the Sun and horizon with
the horizontal extent of the setting Sun. Since Cluj is
not a ﬂat region like South-Bend, we had to be care-
ful in choosing the observation point, and to determine
also the altitude of the optical horizon. Results from
video-recording in comparison with theoretical expecta-
tions (corresponding to the appropriate atmospheric con-
ditions) are plotted in Fig. 14. For this measurement a
quite fair agreement between theoretical and experimen-
tal data is achieved. Since the lapse-rate for the theoret-
ical prediction was taken from the standard atmosphere
model, the slightly greater α values calculated by us are
explainable.

were made at z0 = 100m height with the horizon roughly at
the same altitude. Theoretical results for the corresponding
atmospheric conditions and λ = 6.5K/km standard lapse-rate
is plotted by continuous and dashed lines for the winter and
spring conditions, respectively.

The theoretical curves were constructed for the men-
tioned mean temperature, pressure, observation height of
100m with the horizon at the same altitude and a stan-
dard lapse-rate. These results are plotted on Fig. 13 by
a continuous and dashed line for the winter and spring
conditions, respectively. As observable from Fig. 13 for
the winter conditions the measured α values are in ac-
ceptable agreement with the one given by our theory.
However, for the spring series the expected α values are
higher, and decreasing slower as a function of the δ0 in-
clination angle, than the measured data. A reason to
account for this sharper trend is the decreasing tempera-
ture measured during the sunset. Taking this eﬀect into
account in the calculations, would deﬁnitely result in a
trend closer to the observed one. This temperature vari-
ation does not account however, for the constantly lower
values measured for α. The only arguments we can give
in this sense is that probably the atmosphere at the time
of this measurement had a refractive index proﬁle diﬀer-
ent from the one proposed in our model, behaving in a
non-standard manner.

A second set of experiments were realized by video-
ﬁlming sunsets in Cluj (Romania). The obtained contin-
uous set of picture allowed us to follow-up more precisely
the ﬂatness as a function of the inclination angle. The
inclination angle was calculated from the images by the
same method as in photographs, i.e. by comparing the

VII. PICTURES AND MOVIES FROM THE
INTERNET

Sunset or sunrise (moon-set or moon-rise) is usually a
spectacular phenomena, and thus it is a favorite theme
for professional and amateur photographers. The In-
ternet is full of beautiful and useful pictures in this
sense. Many of these pictures are taken in extreme con-
ditions (arctic environment, airplanes, space-shuttle or
high mountains), oﬀering us an excellent possibility to
check our calculations under these conditions, too. More-
over, on the web there are also interesting, freely down-
loadable or public domain movies exemplifying how the
observed ﬂatness increases in the neighborhood of the
horizon.

We performed an extensive search on the Internet and
collected non-copyrighted materials about sunset, sun-
rise, moon-set and moon-rise. Since their presentation
in the context of this paper is impossible we classiﬁed
and stored them on the web-page [10] dedicated to this
study. The interested reader can browse this collection
and convince himself or herself that these pictures sup-
port our theoretical results for the estimated ﬂatness. In

9

agreement with our expectations we found that for a sun-
rise (or sunset) viewed from a space-shuttle αc should be
of the order 2 − 2.5, and in arctic environment αc in-
creases up to values of 1.3. For most of the everyday,
usual and low-altitude photos one ﬁnds αc ≈ 1.1 − 1.2.
Pictures taken from commercial airplane yield αc ≈ 1.5.
We also found a picture-series for a sunset over the ocean,
where the rim of the Sun is nicely visible. The scenario
presented in this photo is again in agreement with our
theoretical predictions.

The movies stored on our web-page will also convince
the reader about the sharp variation of α as a function
of the δ0 deviation angle. A public domain movie, show-
ing a moon-set viewed from the space-shuttle illustrates
observations from high altitudes.

VIII. THE GREEN FLASH

Although the explanation and the study of the green
ﬂash is not the aim of the present paper, we brieﬂy dis-
cuss here how this phenomenon can be understood and
studied through our methods.

From equation (1) it is obvious that atmospheric re-
fraction depends on the frequency (color) of the light-
ray, a phenomenon called dispersion. Diﬀerently colored
light-rays coming from a source emitting a continuous
spectra will suﬀer diﬀerent deviations. More strongly
will bend the light-rays with bigger frequencies, leading
to a separation of the colors in the observed Sun. Since
the high-frequency visible components (corresponding to
violet and blue colors) are strongly scattered by the at-
mosphere, the green component reaching directly the
observer will suﬀer the strongest bending. When the
Sun disappears bellow the horizon this component will
be observed lastly, leading to a green-ﬂash on the hori-
zon. Since for standard atmospheric conditions the dis-
persion from atmospheric refraction is tinny, the eﬀect
is hardly observable for usual and everyday conditions.
Green ﬂashes become observable exactly under those con-
ditions under which the ﬂatness is more accentuated.
This means high observation altitudes, low temperature
and high pressure. As an illustration of this, we have just
learned that for airplane pilots it is a quite usual phe-
nomenon. Green ﬂashes are often seen in non-standard
optical atmosphere, when mirages appear. This is gen-
erally the case when layers of air with strongly diﬀerent
temperatures are in contact.

For a nice presentation and discussion on green ﬂashes
the interested reader should consult the excellent home-
page of A.T. Young [3].

IX. SUNSET SIMULATION PROGRAM

We also created a computer-code which simulates the
sunset on the computer-screen. By using the discussed

simulation method, the program computes and visual-
izes the rim of the Sun during a sunset. After ﬁxing
the atmospheric conditions (temperature and pressure)
and observation height in the menu, one can follow up
how a sunset might look like in our optical atmosphere.
The program runs under Windows environment and one
can freely download the executable from the web-page
accompanying this study [10].

X. CONCLUSIONS

Atmospheric refraction is responsible for the asymmet-
ric rim of the setting (or rising) Sun. Three diﬀerent
methods yielding the same results were presented here to
compute the path of a light-ray in an optical atmosphere
model, where the refraction index varies continuously as
a function of altitude. By determining the deviation an-
gle between the apparent and real inclination of a point-
like light-source which is at a large distance from the
Earth, we were able to compute the α asymmetry ra-
tio for the rim of the setting Sun. We investigated α as
a function of the inclination angle, observation altitude
and atmospheric conditions. We found that the maximal
ﬂatness obtained in the vicinity of the horizon increases
as a function of observation altitude and pressure, and
decreases as the temperature increases. We found that
α is rather insensitive to the ﬁne-details of the consid-
ered optical atmosphere model, which makes our results
robust. The maximal ﬂatness observable under normal
conditions at sea-level is around 1.2. At extremely low
temperatures (−400C) one can observe values up to 1.3
and for high altitude observations (space-shuttle) one can
get an asymmetry ratio of 2.5. By simple experiments
and pictures from the Internet we illustrate and prove
our theoretical predictions. The methods presented here
can be eﬀectively used to study atmospheric refractions
in non-standard atmospheric conditions as well. In this
manner one can study mirages or the green ﬂash phe-
nomenon. A freeware computer program created by us
and downloadable from the web-page accompanying this
study simulates the sunset for arbitrary atmospheric con-
ditions and observation altitude.

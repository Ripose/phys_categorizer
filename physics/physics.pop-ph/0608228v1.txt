Abstract

A new model, which uses the frequency of individuals’ annual home run

totals, is employed to predict future home run totals and records in Major

League Baseball. Complete home run frequency data from 1903–2005 is

analyzed, resulting in annual exponential distributions whose changes can be

a used as a measure of progression in the sport and serve as a basis against

which record-setting performances can be compared. We show that there is

an 80% chance that Barry Bonds’ current 73 home run record will be broken

in the next 10 years, despite the longevity of previous records held by baseball

legends Babe Ruth and Roger Marris.

Previous attempts to predict athletic progressions have focused on trends

in either world records [1, 2] or the best annual performance [3]. Our new

model looks at all of the athletes and is loosely inspired by the Gutenberg-

Richter relationship for earthquake distributions [4], which relates the like-

lihood of large, rare events to the frequency of smaller ones. By analyzing

the entire population, we can make predictions as to what the top perfor-

mances, interpreted as “large events,” will be. We have successfully applied

this model to a variety of sports exemplifying individual achievement, in-

cluding track and ﬁeld, weight lifting, and baseball [5], observing that the

distribution of such performances is exponential.

In this study we examined annual home run totals for players in Ma-

jor League Baseball between 1903 and 2005 [6]. For each year, we created

frequency distributions based on how many players hit a given number of

homeruns in that year (ﬁg. 1a-c). These distributions show that not only are

there more players hitting few homeruns, which serve as the “small” events,

but also that there is a relationship between this portion of the distribution

and the players with the greatest number of homeruns. The exponential ﬁts

shown in ﬁgure 1a-c are determined by the 95% of players with the lowest

home run totals.

The annual and all-time rarity of a performance is assessed by a player’s

deviation from a given year’s exponential distribution. For example, the dis-

tribution of the lowest home run totals implies that one-third of a player

would hit 51 home runs in 2005 (ﬁg. 1c). If we were to have three times as

2

many players, or simply repeat the same season three times, we would expect

to have one player hitting 51 home runs. Andruw Jones’ 2005 season can thus

be viewed as a once in three-year performance, while Barry Bonds’ current

record is a one in 10-year event (ﬁg. 1b). By comparison, Babe Ruth’s 60

home runs in 1927 is an outstanding one in 10,000-year performance (ﬁg. 1a);

far more impressive than that of Bonds, even though the latter hit 73 home

runs. By considering relative performances, it becomes possible to compare

players of diﬀerent eras, even though baseball has progressed, largely due to

improved training.

To predict home run records, we have analyzed the exponential distri-

butions over the past 103 years and extrapolated the progression of these

distributions to the future. Since 1903, the parameters of the exponential

distributions have been changing in a continuous manner with the rate of

change of each being approximately constant since 1948. We have assumed

that these rates will continue for the near future. The top player of a given

year often performs at a level beyond what is predicted by the lower 95%

of players. This exceedance, which may be due to the additional motivation

that stems from lucrative ﬁnancial pay-oﬀs and sponsorship deals that often

go to the top player, is also included in our model. The result of these factors

suggests that the probability of somebody hitting 74 home runs within the

next ﬁve years, breaking Bonds’ current record, is greater than 50%, and

over 80% after ten years (ﬁg. 1d).

Figure 1: Parts a, b and c show the frequency of players hitting a number

of home runs in 1927, 2001 and 2005 respectively. To ensure that all players

were playing under similar conditions, only players with at least 100 at bats

have been included. For all years, the frequency of the 95% of players with
the lowest home run totals are ﬁt with an exponential curve berN , where r is

the rate parameter, b is the scale and N is the number of home runs. Part d

shows the probability that somebody will break Barry Bondss current home

run record before a given year.

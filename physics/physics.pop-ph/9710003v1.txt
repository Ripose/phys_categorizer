It’s a Wrap! Reviewing the 1997 Outdoor Season

J. R. Mureika

Throughout the summer, I’ve written articles highlighting this year’s
100m performances, and ranking them according to their wind-corrected
values. Now that the fall months draw to a close, and the temperature
drops to a nippy 15 celsius at night (well, for some of us), it seems only
natural to wrap up the year with a rundown of the 1997 rankings.

Of course, it wouldn’t be exciting to just give the oﬃcial rankings, so I
will also present the wind-corrected rankings, and will oﬀer comparison to
the adjusted value of the athlete’s best 100m performance of 1996. Mind
you, this won’t necessarily be the best wind-corrected performance, but it
can oﬀer an insight into how an athlete has progressed over the course of a
year.

As a quick refresher, a 100m time tw assisted by a wind w (the wind
speed) can be corrected to an equivalent time t0 as run with no wind (w =
0 m/s),

This comes about because approximately 3% of the athlete’s eﬀort is spent
ﬁghting atmospheric drag. A tail-wind implicitly boosts a race time, hile
a head-wind can take away a sprinter’s chance at a possible World Record.
(as an interesting aside: this also says that it takes more energy to run into
a head-wind than you get from a tail-wind assistance. So, a 400m can be
handicapped by a suﬃciently strong wind, since running with the wind on
one straight does not compensate for ﬁghting the head-wind on the other
straight).

The next logical step in this review would be to make some predictions
for the upcoming indoor season, based on how everyone performed outdoors
over 50 and 60m (using appropriate splits from Athens, and other meets

1

when available). Tables 1, 5 show the top 5 wind-corrected rankings for
men and women, while Tables 2, 6 give the oﬃcial rankings.

Men’s 1997 Rankings

This summer’s competition was a veritable roller coaster for both the
men and women, full of very unexpected ups and downs. One of the big-
ger surprises was the rise of Maurice Greene to the top-ranked sprinter of
the year. His 9.86s victory (9.88s wind-corrected) marked almost a 0.2s
improvement over his 1996 PB of 10.08s (with -0.3 m/s wind; 10.07s wind-
corrected), which was ranked 28th in the 1996 IAAF list! Of the top 5
wind-corrected times, his showed the largest improvement of 1.9%. Bailey
came close to matching his best from ’96 (that is, his wind-corrected PB)
with his Abbotsford run of 9.89s (10.03s, -2.1 m/s). Ato Boldon chimes
in at 3rd fastest after wind-correction, and although he clocked the most
sub-9.90s performances of the year (9.89s in Modesto, and 9.87s in Athens),
his best wind-corrected performance came out of Stuttgart. Since this time
was run in still conditions (9.90s, +0.0 m/s), it’s an oﬃcial wind-corrected
time! However, it also matches his best wind-corrected performance of 1996
(9.90s; 9.93s, -0.6 m/s).

Fredericks rounds out fourth on the 1997 rankings, with his late-season
9.92s (9.90s, +0.2 m/s) from Brussels (since he ﬁnished 4th in Athens, it
seems that Frank truly was the 4th best in the world this year!). Unfor-
tunately, Fredericks also shows the worst improvement from last year of
the ﬁve, not being able to match his incredible 1996 wind-adjusted mark
of 9.84s (9.86s, -0.4 m/s) from Lausanne. Interestingly enough, 5th ranked
Tim Montgomery showed similar improvement to Greene since last year,
In fact, Montgomery was ranked
where he also ran 10.07s (10.08, -0.3).
27th, just above Greene on the 1996 IAAF top 50 list. A most impressive
showing by the Americans in Athens.

Although the peak performances of Bailey, Boldon, and Fredericks did
not surpass their 1996 bests, Table 3 presents a quick glimpse of their top 5
times of each year. Also present is the average of each time, and the although
not necessarily appropriate for an ordered set of data, the standard devia-
tion is oﬀered to give an idea of the variance of the times. Only Fredericks
does not better his 1996 average, while Bailey tops his by 0.02s, and Boldon
by 0.01s. It’s interesting to note that both Fredericks and Boldon had faster

2

averages than Bailey in 1996. Sometimes, it all comes down to just one race.

While Fredericks posted the fastest average of 1996, Boldon takes it for
1997, and although he could not better his top time of 9.90s, he shows
an impressive ability to run repeat fast times over the two years (standard
deviations of 0.023 asnd 0.029s respectively). Meanwhile, Bailey has also
improved his knack to do same, but Fredericks clearly takes the cake with a
’97 standard deviation of 0.019s! One could say that he has consistently run
the most fast times this year. His top 5 marks for 1997 fall in an interval of
0.05s, compared to Bailey and Boldon’s 0.09s interval.

As a note of national interest, sixth place is given in Table 1. Thanks
in part to a strong head-wind, the National Championships in Abbotsford
not only produced Bailey’s 2nd place 9.89s, but also gave Robert Esmie a
wind-corrected sub-10s clocking at 9.96s, good enough to rank him 6th in
the world! His 9.96s clocking shows a 3% (0.3s!) improvement over his 1996
PB of 10.27A (10.18A, +1.5), which essentially matches his next fastest
time of 10.28s (real still air PB, +0.0 m/s wind). Experimental evidence for
wind-correction!

Women’s 1997 Rankings

The women’s list are no less impressive than the men’s. In fact, they are
in a sense more impressive. A quick examination of Table 5 shows that two
of the ﬁve individuals were not ranked in the top 50 last year. Additionally,
3 of the oﬃcial top 5 in Table 6 were similarly unranked! The emergence of
Marion Jones onto the sprint scene this year showed a virtually unparalleled
rise to the top of the 100m podium. To be a newcomer to the sport and
capture gold at the World Championships in the same year is a feat until
itself. Table 4 attests to her exclusive domination of the event this summer.

On the way up, Jones bumped Jamaican sprint legend Merlene Ottey
down a notch from her 1996 throne. To the very end, Jones also domi-
nated the wind-corrected rankings, but in an impressive show in Tokyo on
September 6th, Ottey chalked up a 10.81s into a 0.4 m/s head-wind. This
adjusted to a 10.79s in still conditions, and put her 0.03s under Jones’ fastest
wind-corrected dash (10.82; 10.76s, +0.9 m/s). It was also her fastest wind-
corrected time ever, bettering her previous adjusted PB of 10.80s, a mark
she set twice (Zurich, 07 Aug 1991; and 16 Aug 1993). Almost two decades

3

in the sport has certainly paid oﬀ for Merlene!

Meanwhile, 200m world champion Zhanna Pintussevich put in a 10.88s
(10.85s, +0.4 m/s) showing to capture 3rd on both the wind-corrected and
oﬃcial lists. Like Boldon, Devers could not manage to surpass her 1996
wind-corrected mark of 10.92s (10.89, +0.5 m/s), well oﬀ her best 10.75s
(10.82, -1.0 m/s) from the Barcelona Olympics in 1992.

As with the men’s list, ﬁfth place is a variable: Sevatheda Fynes holds
the wind-corrected spot with a head-wind 10.98s (11.07s, -1.2 m/s), but of-
ﬁcially Christine Arron (also unranked in 1996!) takes it with 11.03s (-0.3
m/s). Once again, Christine Arron was not ranked in the IAAF’s top 50 list
from 1996! Each athlete who was ranked on the 1996 list (Ottey, Devers)
showed drops in their top performances of 1997.

Split Comparison to Indoor Marks

Indoor races, by their nature, are not inﬂuenced by wind eﬀects for ob-
vious reasons. So, most indoor performances should be comparable to each
other on an implicitly equal footing. The only times which cannot be imme-
diately compared to others are those sprints which are run at altitude. For
example, both Donovan Bailey’s 50m WR (5.56s) and Obadele Thompson’s
55m WB (“World Best”) of 5.99s were run at altitude, a factor which mys-
teriously increases sprint potential.

Since we can correct outdoor races to get an idea of what the times might
have been in still air conditions, it should also be possible to break down
the 100m races to determine the 50m and 60m splits devoid of wind eﬀects.
To do so, the formula given above requires slight modiﬁcation: the 100 in
the denominator of the fraction represents the distance of the race. So, by
replacing 100 with either 50 or 60, we can wind-correct the splits.

Table 7 shows the corrected splits for the men’s and women’s 100m ﬁ-
nals from Athens, which can be compared to the times in Table 8. In the
case of the men, every competitor considered in Table 7 marked a faster
performance than the best indoor 50m of last winter (5.60s... Aside: is this
the ﬁrst time the men’s short sprint lists have been headed by two people
named M. Green[e]?). Likewise with the 60m splits, the leaders from Athens
surpass the indoor 1997 marks over the same distance. Ato Boldon shaved

4

0.03s oﬀ his indoor season best (which of course does not account for reac-
tion time, so technically he may have actually run the same raw time with
a diﬀerent reaction).

Note that in running his Athens ﬁnal, Maurice Greene tied both the
50m and 60m indoor world records for the distances (60m - 6.41s, Andre
Cason, Madrid, 14 Feb 1992). Greene’s best indoor 60m mark for 1997
was 6.54s, slower than all of the others’ top indoor performances. At the
USATF Championships 100m ﬁnal in Indianapolis (13 Jun), he and Tim
Montgomery both split at 50m in 5.57s (5.56s, +0.2 m/s), 0.01s oﬀ the
indoor WR. Although outdoor racing seems to be, in general, faster than
indoor racing (perhaps a physiological eﬀect?), these ﬁndings suggest that
interesting things may be in store for the coming 1998 indoor season!

The women’s lists are lacking somewhat, due to insuﬃcient data. Note
that World Bronze medallist Fynes is not listed in Table 7 (not my fault;
the appropriate data wasn’t recorded). However, there’s enough given to
make the same stab as with the men’s lists. In this case, the splits correct
to times which are much closer to the indoor marks from last winter. Only
Jones and Pintussevich surpass the 50 leader (6.05s, Privalova), but Pintus-
sevich betters her indoor mark by 0.2s! The performances of Arron, Miller,
Paschke, and Ottey are similar to the indoor 50m list. All times are slower
than Privalova’s WR of 5.96s (Madrid, 9 Feb 1995). Jones marked a 50m
split of 6.13s (6.08, +1.1) at the USATF Championships.

For the 60m, Pintussevich again betters her indoor time over the equiv-
alent distance by roughly 0.2s, but Paschke and Ottey failed to improve
theirs. In their defense, Paschke’s wind-corrected split of 7.18s is only 0.01s
slower than her ’97 best indoor (could be a factor of reaction time), while
Ottey was by no means running her perfect race in Athens! Perhaps some-
one should have timed her 60m false start for comparsion?

The Shape of Things to Come?

And so, as 1998 approaches, we gear up for the new indoor season. Come
March, it will be interesting to compare the 1998 indoor lists with the anal-
ysis in this article. Many times, the 50m and 60m rankings can be ﬁlled
with names unknown to the top 10 outdoor performances. Will we see such
a phenomenon again?

The trend in particle physics is to make predictions based on mathemat-
ically abstract models, and hope they unfold in real life. If the prediction
comes true, the theoretician revels in the publicity, and makes more predic-
tions based on the original model. If it doesn’t come true, the theoretician
writes a paper explaining why it didn’t, and blames it away as a statistical
manifestation. Looks like my work for the spring issue of Athletics is cut
out for me either way!

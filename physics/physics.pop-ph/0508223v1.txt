Abstract

A numerical model of 100 m and 200 m world class sprinting performances is modiﬁed

using standard hydrodynamic principles to include eﬀects of air temperature, pressure,

and humidity levels on aerodynamic drag. The magnitude of the eﬀects are found to be

dependent on wind speed. This implies that diﬀering atmospheric conditions can yield

slightly diﬀerent corrections for the same wind gauge reading. In the absence of wind,

temperature is found to induce the largest variation in times (0.01 s per 10◦C increment

in the 100 m), while relative humidity contributes the least (under 0.01 s for all realistic

conditions for 100 m). Barometric pressure variations at a particular venue can also

introduce ﬂuctuations in performance times on the order of a 0.01 s for this race. The

combination of all three variables is essentially additive, and is more important for head-

wind conditions that for tail-winds. As expected, calculated corrections in the 200 m are

1

magniﬁed due to the longer duration of the race. The overall eﬀects of these factors on

sprint times can be considered a “second order” adjustment to previous methods which rely

strictly on a venue’s physical elevation, but can become important in extreme conditions.

1 Introduction

Adjusting athletic sprinting races for atmospheric drag eﬀects has been the

focus of many past studies [1–18]. Factors inﬂuencing the outcome of the

races are both physiological and physical. The latter has included the eﬀects

of wind speed and variations in air density, primarily introduced through

altitude variations. This is due in part to the International Association of

Athletics Federation’s (IAAF) classiﬁcation of “altitude assistance” for com-

petitions at or above 1000 m elevation.

For the 100 m, with the exception of a few references it is generally ac-

cepted that a world class 100 m sprint time will be 0.10 s faster when run

with a 2 ms−1 tail-wind, where as a rise of 1000 m in altitude will decrease a

race time by roughly 0.03 s. The ﬁgures reported in [6] are slight underesti-

mates, although one of the authors has since re-assessed the calculations and

reported consistent values [13] to those mentioned above. A 0.135 s correc-

tion for this windspeed is reported in [11], which overestimates the accepted

value by almost 40%.

Wind eﬀects in the 200 m are slightly more diﬃcult to determine, based

on lack of data (the race is around a curve, but the wind is measured in

only one direction). As a result, the corrections are less certain, but several

References [16, 18] do agree that a 2 ms−1 wind will provide an advantage

between 0.11-0.12 s at sea level. Altitude adjustments are much more spread

out in the literature, ranging between 0.03-0.10 s per 1000 m increase in

elevation. The corrections discussed in [2] and [11] are mostly overestimates,

citing (respectively) 0.75 s and 0.22 s for a 2 ms−1 tail-wind, as well as

0.20 s and 0.08 s for 1000 m elevation change (although this latter altitude

3

correction is fairly consistent with those reported here and in [16]. Conversely,

an altitude change of 1500 m is found to assist a sprinter by 0.11 s in the

study presented in [18].

Several other factors not generally considered in these analyses, which are

nonetheless crucial to drag eﬀects, are air temperature, atmospheric pressure,

and humidity level (or alternatively dew point). There is a brief discussion

of temperature eﬀects in [6], but the authors conclude that they are largely

inconsequential to the 100 m race. However, the wind and altitude correc-

tions considered therein have been shown to be underestimates of the now

commonly accepted values, so a more detailed re-evaluation of temperature

variations is in order.

This paper will investigate the individual and combined eﬀects of these

three factors, and hence will discuss the impact of density altitude variations

on world class men’s 100 m and 200 m race times. The results suggest that

it is not enough to rely solely on physical altitude measurements for the

appropriate corrections, particularly in the 200 m event.

2 The quasi-physical model with hydrodynamic

modiﬁcations

The quasi-physical model introduced in [14] involves a set of diﬀerential equa-

tions with ﬁve degrees of freedom, of the form

˙v(t) = fs + fm − fv − fd .

(1)

˙d(t) = v(t)

4

where the terms {fi} are functions of both t and v(t). The ﬁrst two terms

are propulsive (the drive fs and the maintenance fm), while the third and

fourth terms are inhibitory (a speed term fv and drag term fd). Explicitly,

fs = f0 exp(−σ t2) ,

fm = f1 exp(−c t) ,

fv = α v(t) ,

fd =

1 − 1/4 exp{−σt2}
(cid:16)

(cid:17)

ρAd (v(t) − w)2 .

(2)

The drag term fd is that which is aﬀected by atmospheric conditions. The

component of the wind speed in the direction of motion w is explicitly rep-

resented, while additional variables implicitly modify the term by changing

the air density ρ.

The motivation for using time as the control variable in the system of

equations (2) stems from the idea that eﬃcient running of the short sprints

is an time-optimization problem. This has been discussed in the context of

world records in Reference [19].

2.1 The deﬁnitions of altitude

In general, altitude is not a commonly-measured quantity when considering

practical aerodynamics, simply because the altitude relevant to such prob-

lems is not the physical elevation. It is much easier to measure atmospheric

pressure, which is implicitly determined by the altitude z via the diﬀeren-

tial relationship dP (z) = −ρ g dz, known as the hydrostatic equation [20].

Thus, the pressure P (z) at some altitude z may be obtained by integration

assuming the functional form of the density proﬁle ρ is known. The air den-

5

sity can depend non-trivially on factors such as vapor pressure (i.e. relative

humidity) and temperature.

It is useful to embark on a slight digression from the analysis to consider

several possible deﬁnitions of altitude. Including density altitude, there are at

least four possible types of altitudes used in aerodynamic studies: geometric,

geopotential, density, and pressure. Focus herein will be primarily on the

ﬁrst three.

Both geometric and geopotential altitudes are determined independently

of any atmospheric considerations. Geometric altitude is literally the physical

elevation measured from mean sea level to a point above the surface. Geopo-

tential altitude could just as easily be deﬁned as equipotential altitude. It is

deﬁned as the radius of a speciﬁc (gravitational) equipotential surface which

surrounds the earth.

Density and pressure altitude, on the other hand, are deﬁned as the alti-

tudes which yields the standard altitude for a given set of parameters. The

variation of pressure as a function of height z is

For the small altitude changes considered herein, it is more than appropriate

to adopt the approximations g(z) ≈ g ≡ constant and the linear temperature

gradient T (z) = T0 − Λz, where Λ is the temperature lapse rate. In this case,

rate, and g the sea level gravitational constant. The explicit values of these

In the presence of humidity, the density ρ is a combination of both dry

air density ρa and water vapor density ρv. This can be written in terms of

the associated pressures as [22]

ρ = ρa + ρv =

Pa
Ra T

Pv

,

where each term is derived from the ideal gas law, with Pa and Pv the pres-

sure of dry air and water vapor, and Ra = 287.05 and Rv = 461.50 the

corresponding gas constants. Since the total pressure is simply the sum of

both dry air pressure and vapor pressure, P = Pa + Pv, the previous equation

may be simpliﬁed to give

(8)

(9)

ρ =

P − Pv
Ra T

+

Pv

.

The presence of humidity lowers the density of dry air, and hence lowers

aerodynamic drag. However, the magnitude of this reduction is critically

dependent on temperature. A useful and generally accurate approximation

to calculate vapor pressure is known as the Magnus Teten equation, given by

[22]

Pv ≈ 107.5T /(237.7+T ) ·

Hr
100

(10)

where Hr is the relative humidity measure and T is the temperature in ◦C.

Figures 1 and 2 show the calculated density altitudes for the temperature

range in question, including curves of constant relative humidity, for normal

pressure (101.3 kPa) as well as high-altitude pressure (75 kPa). The latter is

representative of venues such as those in Mexico City, where world records

were set in every sprint race and jumping event at the 1968 Olympic Games.

It is somewhat striking to note that a 20◦C temperature range at a ﬁxed

pressure can yield an eﬀective altitude change of over 600 m, and even greater

8

values with the addition of humidity and lowered station pressure. This

suggests that a combination of the eﬀects considered in this paper can have

signiﬁcant inﬂuence on sprint performances (especially in the 200 m which

has been shown to be strongly inﬂuenced by altitude [16]).

2.2 A note on meteorological pressure

A review of reported meteorological pressure variations seems to suggest that

annual barometric averages for all cities range between about 100-102 kPa.

This might seem contradictory to common sense, since one naturally expects

atmospheric pressure to drop at higher altitudes. Much in the same spirit as

this work, it is common practice to report sea-level corrected (SL) pressures

instead of the measured (station) atmospheric pressures, in order to compare

the relative pressure diﬀerences experienced between weather stations, as well

as to predict the potential for weather system evolution.

Given a reported SL pressure PSL at a (geophysical) altitude z, the station

pressure Pstn can be computed as [23]

Pstn = PSL

288 − 0.0065z

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

(11)

The present study uses only station atmospheric pressures, but a conversion

formula which can utilize reported barometric pressure will be oﬀered in a

subsequent section.

3 Results

identical to those in [14],

The model parameters used for the 100 meter analysis in this study are

f0 = 6.10 ms−2 f1 = 5.15 ms−2 σ = 2.2 s−2

c = 0.0385 s−1

α = 0.323 s−1

Ad = 0.00288 m2kg−1

(12)

as well as the ISA parameters described previously. By deﬁnition, these give

a density altitude of 0 meters at 15◦C, P0 = 101.325 kPa and 0% relative

humidity.

Since few track meets are held at such “low” temperatures, the standard

performance to which all others will be compared will be for the conditions

P = 101.3 kPa, T = 25◦C, and a relative humidity level of 50%, which

produces a raw time (i.e. excluding reaction) of 9.698 s. Note that the cor-

responding density altitude for this performance under the given conditions

would be Hρ = 418 meters. Thus, if the performance were physically at sea

level, the conditions would replicate an atmosphere of elevation Hρ. Also,

the relative humidity level is never measured at 0%. The range of possible

relative humidity readings considered herein are thus constrained between

25% and 100%.

The associated performance adjustments in the 100 meter sprint for vari-

ous conditions are displayed in Figures 3 through 8, while Figures 9 through

13 show possible adjustments to the 200 meter sprint (see Section 5 for

further discussion). General features of all graphs include a narrowing pa-

rameter space for increasing wind speeds. This implies that regardless of

the conditions, stronger tail winds will assist performances by a smaller de-

10

gree with respect to the “base” performance than will head winds of similar

strength. This is completely consistent with previous results in the literature,

and furthermore is to be expected based on the mathematical form of the

drag component.

Ranked in terms of magnitude of eﬀect, humidity variations show the

least impact on race times. Small changes in atmospheric pressure that

one might expect at a given venue show slightly more inﬂuence on times.

Temperature changes over the range considered show the greatest individual

impact. However, it is the combination of the three factors that creates the

greatest impact, as is predictable based on the calculated density altitudes.

3.1 Temperature and relative humidity variations

At ﬁxed pressure and temperature, the range of realistic humidity variations

shows little inﬂuence on 100 meter race times (Figure 3), yielding corrections

of under 0.01 s for the range considered. Since race times are measured to

this precision, the eﬀects would be no doubt negligible. The corrections for

low pressure regions are also less than the 0.01 s. Due to the extremely slim

nature of the parameter space, the eﬀects of wind will essentially be the same

regardless of the relative humidity reading.

Similarly, if temperature is allowed to vary at a ﬁxed humidity level,

the corrections grow in magnitude but are still relatively small (Figure 4).

Although one would realistically expect variations in barometer reading de-

pending on the venue, the chosen values are to reﬂect a sampling of the

possible range of pressures recorded at the events. On its own, temperature

does not have a profound impact on the simulation times over the ∆T = 20◦C

11

range considered herein. With no wind or relative humidity at ﬁxed pressure

(101.3 kPa), a 100 m performance will vary only 0.023 s in the given temper-

ature range. Overall, this corresponds to approximately a 750 m change in

density altitude (the 15◦C condition corresponds roughly to the standard at-

mosphere except for the non-zero humidity, and thus a density altitude not

signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from 0 m). Compared to the standard performance,

temperatures below 25◦C are equivalent to running at a lower altitude (e.g.

below sea level).

A +2 ms−1 tailwind and standard conditions will assist a world class

100 m performance by 0.104 s using the input parameters deﬁned in Equa-

tion 12. This is essentially identical to the prediction in [14], since the stan-

dard 100 m performance has been deﬁned to be under these conditions. In-

creasing the temperature to 35◦C yields a time diﬀerential of 0.111 seconds

over the standard race, whereas decreasing the temperature to 15◦C shows

a diﬀerence of 0.097 seconds. Hence, the diﬀerence in performance which

should be observed over the 20◦C range is roughly 0.02 s.

In combination, these factors expand the parameter space from that of

temperature variation alone. Figure 5 shows the region bounded by the

lowest density altitude conditions (low temperature and low humidity) and

the highest (higher temperature and higher humidity). In this case, with no

wind the performances can be up to 0.026 s diﬀerent (eﬀectively the additive

result of the individual temperature and humidity contributions). Although

such adjustments to the performances seem small, it should be kept in mind

that a diﬀerence of 0.03 s is a large margin in the 100 meter sprint, and can

cause an athlete to miss a qualifying time or even a record.

12

3.2 Pressure variations

As one would expect, the greatest variations in performances next to wind

eﬀects is introduced by changes in atmospheric pressure. Barometric pressure

changes will be addressed in two ways. First, variations in pressure for a ﬁxed

venue will be considered. Diurnal and seasonal ﬂuctuations in barometer

reading are generally small for a given location [24], at most 1 kPa from

average.

Model simulations for performances run at unusually high pressure (102.5 kPa)

and unusually low pressure (100.5 kPa) with constant temperature and rel-

ative humidity actually show little variation (under 0.01 s). However, if the

temperature and humidity are such as to allow extreme under-dense and

over-dense atmospheres, then the eﬀects are ampliﬁed. Figure 6 demon-

strates how such ambient weather could potentially aﬀect performances run

at the same venue. With no wind, the performances can be diﬀerent by

almost 0.03 seconds for the conditions considered, similar to the predicted

adjustments for the combined temperature and humidity conditions given in

the previous subsection.

The performance range for races run at high-altitude venues under similar

temperature and humidity extremes is plotted in Figure 7. The base perfor-

mance line is given as reference for the inﬂuence of larger pressure changes.

At the lower pressure, the width of the parameter space for zero wind condi-

tions is 0.021 seconds, but the lower density altitude point is already 0.071 s

faster than the base performance. Thus, depending on the atmospheric con-

ditions at the altitude venue races could be upward of 0.1 seconds faster than

those run under typical conditions at sea level.

13

3.3 Combined eﬀects of temperature, pressure, and

humidity

The largest diﬀerences in performances arise when one considers combined

eﬀects of pressure, temperature, and relative humidity. Figure 8 shows the

allowed parameter space regions for performances run in extremal conditions:

75 kPa, 100% humidity, and 35◦C (yielding the least dense atmosphere) and

101.3 kPa, 25% humidity, 15◦C. The total allowed performance space is

shown in Figure 8.

Note that the diﬀerence in extremes is exceptionally ampliﬁed for head-

winds. Based on the total horizontal width in the Figure, a performance

run with a strong tail-wind (top of left curve) at high altitude can be almost

half a second faster than the same performance run with an equal-magnitude

headwind in extremely low density altitude conditions.

4 Back-of-the-envelope conversion formula

Reference [14] gives a simple formula which can be used to correct 100 meter

sprint times according to both wind and altitude conditions,

t0,0 ≃ tw,H[1.03 − 0.03 exp(−0.000125 · H)(1 − w · tw,H/100)2] .

(13)

The time tw,H (s) is the recorded race time run with wind w (ms−1) and at

altitude H (m), while the time t0,0 is the adjusted time as if it were run at

sea level in calm conditions.

It is a simple task to modify Equation 13 to account instead for density

altitude. The exponential term represents the change in altitude, thus it can

14

be replaced with a term of the form ρ/ρ0, where ρ is the adjusted density,

and ρ0 is the reference density. Alternatively, the original approximation in

Equation 13 may be used with the altitude H being the density altitude.

Table 1 shows how the top 100 meter performances are re-ordered ac-

cording to the given approximation. These are compared with the original

back-of-the-envelope approximations given in Reference [14], based exclu-

sively on altitude. The weather conditions have been taken from the NC

DC database [24]. The relative humidity has been calculated from the mean

dew-point. The cited temperature is the maximum temperature recorded

on that particular date, which is assumed to be reﬂective of the conditions

near the surface of the track (since the surface reﬂection and re-emission of

heat from the rubberized material usually increases the temperature from the

recorded mean). Typical trackside temperatures reported in [25] support this

argument. For example, the surface temperature during the 100 m ﬁnal in

Atlanta (9.84 s, +0.7 ms−1 performance in Table 1) was reported as 27.8◦C.

The eﬀects of density altitude are for the most part overshadowed by

wind eﬀects and are generally within 0.01 s of each other after rounding

to two decimal places. However, larger variations are observable in certain

cases. The most notable diﬀerences are in the 9.80 s performance (Maurice

Greene, USA) at the 1999 World Championships in Seville, ESP, due to the

unusually high temperature, as well as the 9.85 s performance in Ostrava,

CZE (Asafa Powell, Jamaica). The temperature measurement during the

latter was reportedly a chilly 10◦C and humidity levels near 100%.

At the time of writing of this manuscript, the world record in the men’s

100 meter sprint is 9.77 seconds by Asafa Powell, set on 14 June 2005 in

15

Athens, Greece (note that although there is a faster performance listed in

the Table, only races with winds under +2 ms−1 are eligible for record status).

The wind reading for this performance was +1.6 ms−1. According to Table 1,

Powell’s world record run actually adjusts to about 9.85 s, very close to his

earlier time from Ostrava.

In fact, prior to this the world record was 9.78 s by Tim Montgomery of

the USA. The wind in this race was just at the legal limit for performance rat-

iﬁcation (+2 ms−1). This time adjusts to an even slower performance of 9.87 s

with density altitude considerations (9.88 s using the older method). Both of

these times are eclipsed by the former world record of Maurice Greene, who

posted a time of 9.79 s (+0.1 ms−1) in Athens roughly six years to the day

prior to Powell’s race. This time adjusts to between 9.80-9.81 s depending

on the conversion method.

5 Corrections to 200 meter race times

Aerodynamic drag eﬀects in the 200 m sprint have been found to be com-

pounded due to the longer duration and distance of the race.

In Refer-

ence [16], it was suggested that “extreme” conditions such as high wind and

altitude can considerably aﬀect performances for better or worse. That is,

a 1000 m altitude alone can improve a world class sea-level performance by

up to 0.1 s, the equivalent assistance provided by a +2 ms−1 tail-wind in

the 100 m sprint. Higher altitudes can yield even greater boosts. Thus, the

variability of density altitude would seem to be all the more relevant to the

200 m sprint.

16

(14)

(15)

(16)

This section does not seek to provide a comprehensive analysis for the

200 m (e.g. the inﬂuence of cross-winds or lane dependence), so only the

results for a race run in lane 4 of a standard IAAF outdoor track will be

reported. The model equations (1) are adapted for the curve according to

Reference [16],

where

˙v(t) = β(fs + fm) − fv − fd ,

β(v(t); Rl) = (1 − ξ v(t)2/Rl) ,

and Rl is the radius of curvature (in meters) for the track in lane l,

Rl = 36.80 + 1.22 (l − 1) ,

compliant with the standard IAAF track. For the 200 m, slightly diﬀerent

parameters used are to reﬂect the more “energy-conservative” strategy for

the race [16]: f0 = 6.0 ms−2; f1 = 4.83 ms−2; c = 0.024 s−1. The other

parameters remain unchanged. The curve factor is ξ = 0.015. As with

the 100 meter sprint, the standard performance adopted for comparison is

19.727 s, run in lane 4 at 25◦C and 50% relative humidity. Under these

conditions, a 2 ms−1 wind assists the sprinter by approximately 0.113 s.

The eﬀects of humidity alone are again eﬀectively inconsequential, in this

case showing less than a 0.01 s diﬀerential with no wind (Figure 9. For wind

speeds of 2 ms−1 at the same pressure value combined with a 50% increase

in humidity, the advantage over the base conditions grows to 0.118 s. Thus,

for all wind speeds considered, the eﬀects of humidity are negligible.

Temperature plays a much stronger role in the longer sprint. Figure 10

shows this eﬀect for ﬁxed pressure and relative humidity. In both 15◦C and

17

35◦C weather, a world class 200 meter sprint can be approximately 0.03 s

slower or faster, giving a total diﬀerential of 0.065 s over the entire 20◦C

range.

Figure 11 demonstrates the eﬀects of pressure variation at a speciﬁc

venue (at constant temperature and relative humidity). At higher pressures

(102.5 kPa), the simulation shows the race time slowed by 0.011 s, while at

unusually low pressures (100.5 kPa) the race by only 0.007 s.

In extremal conditions, including temperature and humidity variations

as well causes these diﬀerentials to dramatically change (Figure 12. For

unusually high pressure, low temperature and humidity conditions, the race

time is 0.045 s slower as compared to the base conditions. On the other

hand, the lower pressure, higher temperature and humidity conditions yield

a 0.048 s decrease in the race time. Thus, the diﬀerence between two 200 m

races run at the same venue but under these vastly diﬀering conditions could

up up to 0.1 seconds diﬀerent even if there is no wind present.

The most striking diﬀerence is observed when considering diﬀerences be-

tween venues or large station pressure diﬀerences (Figure 13). With no wind,

the diﬀerence between the base conditions and those at high altitude (at the

same temperature and relative humidity) can be 0.23 s, which is consistent

with the ﬁgures reported in Reference [16] for a 2500 m altitude diﬀerence.

Recall that the diﬀerence in density altitude between these two conditions is

roughly 3000 m.

A 2 ms−1 wind improves the low pressure performance by only 0.083 s over

still conditions at the same pressure, but when compared to the base condi-

tions this ﬁgure becomes 0.313 s. In fact, the complete horizontal span of the

18

parameter space depicted in Figure 13 is almost 0.64 seconds, demonstrating

the exceeding variability that one could expect in 200 m race times. Again,

this assumes that the wind is blowing exclusively in one direction (down the

100 meter straight portion of the track), and is unchanged throughout the

duration of the race.

5.1 Can density altitude explain the men’s 200 meter

world record?

Michael Johnson (USA) upset the standard in the men’s 200 m event in

1996 when he set two world records over the course of the summer. At the

USATF Championships in Atlanta, his time of 19.66 s (wind +1.6 ms−1)

erased the 25 year old record of 19.72 s (set in Mexico City, and thus altitude

assisted). However, it was his performance of 19.32 s (wind +0.4 ms−1) at

the Olympic Games which truly redeﬁned the race. Reference [16] oﬀers a

thorough analysis of the race which addresses wind and altitude eﬀects. It

was suggested that overall, the race received less than a 0.1 s boost from the

combined conditions (Atlanta sits at roughly 350 m above sea level).

In light of the current analysis, however, the question can be posed:

“By how much could Johnson’s race have been assisted?”. Extensive track-

side meteorological data was recorded at the Games, and is reported in

Reference[25]. According to this data, the mean surface temperature during

the race (21:00 EDT, 01 August 1996) was 34.7◦C, with a relative humid-

ity of 67%. From the NCDC database, the adjusted sea-level pressure was

recorded as 101.7 kPa. Combined, these values give a density altitude of

1175 meters (Atlanta’s physical elevation is roughly 315 meters).

19

As compared to the base conditions (a density altitude of about 400 m),

this represents an 800 m change in eﬀective altitude. According to the re-

sults of Reference [16], such an altitude increase results in an advantage of

approximately 0.05 seconds. When the minimal wind is taken into account

(0.3 ms−1), the diﬀerence rises to 0.1 s. Previously, the “corrected” value of

the World Record was reported as 19.38 s [16] using only wind-speed and

physical altitude, so the inclusion of density altitude enhances the correction

by 0.04 s and thus adjusts the time to a base 19.42 s.

While this does not explain the enormous improvement over the previous

record, is does highlight that density altitude considerations become increas-

ingly important in the 200 meter sprint, and no doubt even moreso for the

400 meter event.

6 Conclusions

This report has considered the eﬀect of pressure, temperature, and relative

humidity variations on 100 and 200 meter sprint performances. It has been

determined that the inﬂuence of each condition can be ranked (in order of

increasing assistance) by humidity, pressure, and temperature. The combined

eﬀects of each are essentially additive. When wind conditions are taken into

account, the impact is ampliﬁed for head-winds but dampened for tail-winds.

All in all, the use of density altitude over geophysical (or geopotential)

altitude seems somewhat irrelevant, since the associated corrections are dif-

ferent by a few hundredths of a second at best. Nevertheless, it is the diﬀer-

ence of these few hundredths which can secure a performance in the record

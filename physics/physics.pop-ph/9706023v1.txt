Abstract

Recently, a simple model was derived to account for a sprinter’s energy loss around a

curve, based on previous sprint models for linear races. This paper oﬀers a quick test of

the model’s precision by comparing split times from Donovan Bailey’s 150m “Challenge

of Champions” race at Skydome on June 1st, 1997. The discrepancy in the track conﬁg-

uration which almost prompted Bailey to drop from the race is also addressed.

In a highly controversial showdown at Skydome in Toronto on June 1st,
Canadian sprinter Donovan Bailey proved that he is the “World’s Fastest
Man” by defeating opponent Michael Johnson of the United States over an
unconventional distance of 150m. Bailey clocked a time of 14.99s, a mere
0.02s oﬀ the “oﬃcial” World Record of 14.97s, held by Britain’s Linford
Christie.

The showdown was set in motion by each athlete’s remarkable perfor-
mance at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, Georgia. Bailey captured
gold in the 100m with a World Record time of 9.84s, while Johnson obliter-
ated the existing 200m World Record in a breathtaking 19.32s. Following the
latter of these sprints, public opinion and media inﬂuence (not to mention
American nationalism) split the vote on who actually should be the bearer
of the title “World’s Fastest Man”, a designation traditionally reserved for

the 100m champion.

A number of predictions were made in the buildup to this race as to the
value of the winning time. Even contests were held, with prizes going to
the individual who could correctly guess the victor and his corresponding
victorious time. The majority of these predictions were well under the oﬃcial
14.99s ﬁnish (see e.g. [1, 2, 3]), and most fell in the range of 14.70 ∼ 14.80s.
So, to add to the disappointment of Johnson’s dropping out mid–way due
to injury was Bailey’s curiously “slow” victory.

In this brief report, Bailey’s performance will be discussed in light of a
simple model to calculate short sprint times for races which are partially
run oﬀ a curve [5]. To quickly review the model and associated history, one
must recall the underlying assumptions of the original model. In the early
1970s, J. Keller [4] proposed that the distance covered by a sprinter over a
given time could be expressed as the solution to the diﬀerential equation

˙v(t) = f (t) − τ

v(t) ,

−1

where v(t) is the velocity at time t, f (t) is a measure of force/unit mass
exerted by the athlete, and τ −1 is a decay term (which crudely models
fatigue–related factors). From his analysis (an optimization problem), Keller
determined that f (t) = f ≡ constant for short sprints [4]. The solution to
(1) is found subject to the constraint v(0) = 0, f (t) ≤ f , and the resulting
distance d traveled in time T is simply

(1)

d =

dt v(t) .

There is an additional equation which couples with (2) if the race is longer
than 291m, but this will not be addressed here. The interested reader is
directed to the citations in [4] for further reading.

Prompted by the 150m showdown between Bailey and Johnson, R. Tib-
shirani revised (1) in a statistical analysis based on the Atlanta races which
predicted Bailey would win by a margin of (0.02, 0.19) seconds at a 95%
conﬁdence level [2]. His adjustment to (1) consisted of the modiﬁcation of
f (t), reasoning that it is erroneous to set f (t) = f = const. ∀t. Rather,
since a sprinter must experience fatigue at some rate, it would make more
sense to assume that f (t) = f − ct, for some c > 0.

Tibshirani notes [2], however, that neither Keller’s nor his model take
into account the eﬀects of the curve, i.e. their power of predictability dras-
tically diminishes for races longer than 100m. In [5], a simple term propor-

2

tional to the centrifugal force felt by the runner is introduced to Tibshirani’s
modiﬁcation of (1). Since ideally the two forces are normal to each other,
the terms are added vectorally. The resulting equation of motion is

˙v(t) = −τ

v(t) +

−1

(f − ct)2 − λ2 v(t)4

(3)

for a track with curve of radius R.

The term λ is introduced to account for the fact that a sprinter does not
feel the full value of the centrifugal force exerted on him/her (by means of
leaning into the turn, banked curves, diﬀerent use of leg muscles, etc...). It
is a simpliﬁed attempt to model a seemingly non–trivial mechanism.

The total distance of races run oﬀ the curve can be expressed as d =

dc + ds, where

dc =

dt vc(t),

ds =

dt vs(t) ,

(4)

with vc(t) the solution to Equation (3), and vs(t) the velocity as expressed
in the modiﬁed (1) (with f (t) = f − ct), subject to the boundary condition
vc(t1) = vs(t1). Here, t1 is the time required to run the curved portion of
the race (distance dc).

Split times (e.g. the time t1 to run the curve) have never been recorded
accurately until recently, so there has been up till now an unfortunate lack
of empirical data which could be used to make or break such a model.
Luckily, the 150m race held at Skydome was well–documented, and splits
were obtained for the 50m and 100m marks; the former is on the curve, the
latter not. The oﬃcial splits [6] for Donovan Bailey are given in Table 1. If
the model is an accurate representation of the physical process, a value of λ2
can be found to reproduce these times subject to the equations of motion.
The track used in Skydome was an unconventional conﬁguration of dc =
ds = 75m (herafter denoted as 75m+75m), and was to have had a radius
of curvature corresponding to lanes 8 and 9 of a standard outdoor track [7].
The corresponding value of R can be calculated as

R =

+ 1.25(p − 1)

metres ,

for p the lane number. The form of (5) roughly results from the IAAF
regulations governing curvature of outdoor tracks. The total curve length
in lane p = 1 (the smallest radius of curvature) must be exactly 100m (the
complete set of IAAF rules and regulations can be obtained from [8]).

For the equations of motion in (3), the parameters obtained for Bailey
from a least square ﬁt of his oﬃcial Atlanta splits (see [5] for speciﬁc details)
are used. These are (f, τ, c) = (7.96, 1.72, 0.156).

The night prior to competition, Bailey threatened to drop out of the
race, citing that the track did not conform to the speciﬁcations agreed upon
in a signed contract.
In particular, he claimed that the curvature of his
lane corresponded more to lane 3 of an outdoor track rather than lane 8.
Additionally, he submitted that the curve was 10m longer than anticipated,
giving a 85m+65m conﬁguration instead of 75m+75m [9].

Thus, (3) is solved for the split distances 50m, 100m, as well as the ﬁnal
150m mark. The model in [5] does not account for the sprinter’s reaction
time, which must be added on to the resulting calculated times. For Bailey,
this was treac =+0.171s [6].

Tables 2, 3 give the splits for a 75m+75m conﬁguration total as run by
Bailey in lanes 3 and 8, respectively. Tables 4, 5 present the same infor-
mation for an 85m+65m conﬁguration. Note that in this case, the splits
would be equal up to 75m, since (for equal lane assignments) the curve is
of the same radius despite the fact that it is longer. So, splits are only
given for 85m and beyond. The sixth column lists the sum of diﬀerence
of squares (a loose measure of relative error from a small sample space)

Table 1 and ti the associated model predictions.

i=50,100,150 ∆2

The ﬁndings in [5] suggest that λ2 could realistically assume a value
between 0.50 and 0.80, so similar values are used here. For interest’s sake,
possible 200m times for Bailey are extrapolated, to gauge whether or not he
could be a viable contender to Michael Johnson in the 200m, as stated in
his post-race interview.

P

Upon ﬁrst inspection, the model [5] reproduces the oﬃcial splits and
race time surprisingly well. The smallest value of Σ2 for each conﬁguration
is taken to be the closest ﬁt to the oﬃcial race splits. These are:

• 75m+75m, lane 3: λ2 = 0.50; Σ2 = 8.48 × 10−5
• 75m+75m, lane 8: λ2 = 0.80; Σ2 = 7.90 × 10−5
• 85m+65m, lane 3: λ2 = 0.50; Σ2 = 2.71 × 10−5

4

• 85m+65m, lane 8: λ2 = 0.70; Σ2 = 4.22 × 10−5

Interestingly enough, the closest match above comes from the 85m+65m
lane 3 conﬁguration, which is the conﬁguration allegedly used contrary to
the signed contracts. However, it is obvious that a more precise choice of λ2
could easily yield a closer match for any of the conﬁgurations. The diﬀerent
solutions arise from the readjustment of the ratio λ/R; hence, to narrow
down an “exact” solution (if indeed one exists), one needs to analyze other
race splits. An interesting test of the model will come at the end of June
1997, when Donovan Bailey will run a 150m race at a Grand Prix meet in
Sheﬃeld, England (most likely on a 50m+100m conﬁguration; see [1] for
Bailey’s possible 150m times on such a track).

In [5], some possible 200m times were obtained which Bailey might be
able to run under peak conditions. It was found that λ2 ∈ [0.5, 0.7] yielded
200m times between 20.29s–20.59s, as run in lane 4 of an outdoor track,
which are reproduced in Table 6. These closely approximated Bailey’s 1994
personal bests of 20.76s / 20.39s wind–assisted [5]).

This season (1997), Bailey has clocked a 20.65s 200m [10], which agrees
with the cited range of λ2. Assuming that the same value of λ2 held for
the 150m race in Skydome (between 0.7–0.8 [5]), then according to Table 3,
then a possible conﬁguration of the track would have been 75m+75m with
a curve radius equivalent to lane 8 (5.78s, 10.27s, 14.92s). Accounting for
the fact that Bailey was undoubtedly much more mentally and physically
prepared for the Skydome match, then it is likely that his equivalent outdoor
200m time would drop. The values λ2 = 0.6 give 200m times between 20.29s
– 20.40s, which is a reasonable range for Bailey to hit if he runs all–out. It
is not inconceivable that he could run a low 20s race, despite his higher PB
of 20.65s. Both Frank Fredricks of Namibia and Ato Boldon of Trinidad are
comparable 100m runners, and each has clocked a sub–20s 200m time (19.66s
and 19.80s, respectively [8]). Undoubtedly, it is high muscular endurance
which allows them to do this.

For each case listed above, Bailey’s extrapolated 200m times of Tables 2-
5 are generally less than for a standard outdoor track. This is simply due
to the fact that the longer curve outdoors (100m v.s. 75m) creates a larger
drain on f (t). Whether or not such seemingly large time discrepancies are
physically realizable, or are just a manifestation of the model, are unknown.
The proof is left to the sprinter.

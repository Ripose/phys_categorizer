ingredient is the way the building opposes the progress of the avalanche, which is expressed in terms
of a reaction force R at the location of the collapse front (a moving interface between the building
and the avalanche). We consider three realistic functional forms of R: (i), the uniform reaction
where R = r · M · g, with M being the total mass of the building, g being the Earth’s gravity, and
r being a constant independent of position; (ii), the uniform safety, where R = s · m(Y ) · g, with
m(Y ) being the mass of the avalanche, the bottom of which is at the position Y = Y (t), and s being
a constant independent of position; (iii), the uniform collapse where R = r · M · g + s · m(Y ) · g. In
each case the collapse model results in an ordinary diﬀerential equation (ODE) of the second degree.
We choose the necessary initial and ﬁnal conditions for the ODE as follows: as the position where
collapse starts we take the top ﬂoor of the impact area, while the initial velocity of the avalanche is
zero. To simplify our analysis we assume that the impacted ﬂoors have sustained maximal damage
so we set R ≡ 0 therein, while for the ﬂoors below, the functional form of R is one of the above
three.
We numerically solve the models to ﬁnd for what values of parameters r or s, or both, the total
collapse times are equal to the measured total collapse time of WTC 2 of Tc = 11 sec: r ≃ 0.1
in the uniform reaction; s ≃ 0.22 in the uniform safety; and r/0.1 + s/0.22 ≃ 1 in the uniform
collapse model. For comparison, r = 1, s = 1, and r + s ≥ 1, are the minimal values that
building must have in order to be standing, absent any other strain, in the uniform reaction, the
uniform safety, and the uniform collapse models, respectively. The realistic estimate for WTC 2 is
(rW T C , sW T C ) ≃ (0.1, 1.4), in the uniform collapse model.
Based on these ﬁndings we surmise that the collapse of WTC 2 was inconsequential to the damage
sustained in the collision with the airplane.

I.

INTRODUCTION

On September 11, 2001, the World Trade Center buildings 1 and 2 were attacked in an unusual way - an airplane
hit each building and damaged a limited number of ﬂoors. Some time after the impact each building collapsed to
the ground in near free-fall times. It appeared that in each building the collapse originated in an avalanche that
formed in the upper part of the building and which propagated along the building’s vertical axis bringing the whole
building to the ground. According to the NIST WTC commission report, the avalanche started because the ﬂoors
damaged by the airplane could not support the weight of the building above them any more. The avalanche then
gained momentum in a fall through impacted ﬂoors1, and seemingly obtained enough momentum to bring the rest of
the building down. The NIST commission made no attempt to make a quantitative assessment of the damage done
to the impacted section of the building, as well as to the parts of the building that were not hit by the airplane,
thus leaving room for speculations and conspiracy theories. Later on, the NIST ﬁndings entered the oﬃcial 9/11
commission report2, and has been since accepted as a fact beyond reasonable doubt through repetition rather than
through corroborating evidence.

In this report we examine a physical model of an avalanche in one spatial dimension based on the 9/11 commission
scenario of the collapse. In Sec. II we develop a mathematical model of an avalanche, and examine the role of reaction
force. There we suggest a parameterization of the reaction force R in terms of two parameters, r and s, for reaction
and safety, respectively, which leads to three functional forms for R. In Sec. III we derive initial conditions for the
avalanche using the actual data from WTC 2 and estimate its rW T C and sW T C .
IV we show results of
calculation for each of the functional forms for the reaction force, where we ﬁnd for what values of parameters r, or
s, or both, the total collapse time is equal to the observed collapse time of WTC 2. In Sec. V we discuss our ﬁndings
and elaborate on possible omissions in the scenario proposed by the 9/11 commission with respect to the amount of
damage to the whole building, and not just to its impacted section, it requires.

II. ONE-DIMENSIONAL MODEL OF COLLAPSE

Consider an object falling towards the ground along a single (vertical) coordinate, with some instantaneous velocity,
call it ˙Y . Here, a single dot above the letter implies diﬀerentiation with respect to time. As is known, on its way

down the object is being accelerated by the ubiquitous gravitational force proportional to the mass of the object. Let
us next assume that the mass that is in the object’s path is stationary and that the objects picks up all the mass in
its path. This represents an avalanche. The acquisition of mass by the object creates a friction force - this is because
the acquired mass has to be accelerated from zero to the velocity of the object. In an avalanche consuming a building,
the concept of collapse front is useful. The collapse front is a ﬁctional point along the y-axis which separates the
avalanche, i.e., moving or collapsing part of the building, from its stationary or standing part. The avalanche cannot
move past the collapse front, thus the position of the front is adequate to determine the position of the avalanche.

To ﬁnd the mass of the avalanche let us assume that the building is initially of height H, and that its mass is
uniformly distributed along the height. If at some later time t the collapse front has dropped down to height Y (t),
where 0 ≤ Y (t) < H, then the mass of the avalanche m = m(Y ) is

m(Y ) =

· (H − Y (t)) .

Let us next recall the Newton law of motion in one-dimension and apply it to the motion of avalanche of the

Here, F is the total force acting on the avalanche, while p is the momentum of the avalanche, which incorporates
its changing velocity and its increasing mass. In our case of an avalanche destroying the building, this force can be
represented as a sum of two components,

Here, G is the gravitational force accelerating the avalanche towards ground (downwards),

with g = 9.82 m/s2 being the gravity. R in Eq. (3) is called the reaction force and we dicuss it next.

A. Reaction Force Assumption No.1: Uniformity of R

The reaction force R is the mass-force, R = g · Mc, where Mc = Mc(Y ) is the total mass that can be loaded on a
ﬂoor of the building at height Y , without having the building collapse. In this report we concentrate on the following
three realistic functional forms for R:

(i) R = const., i.e., where R is uniform throughout the building. Here, we introduce quantity r, and call it reaction,

and assume that the reaction force R is given by

(ii) R ∝ m(Y ) · g describes the building which is designed so at a given height Y it can carry at least the weight of
the part of the building above it, the mass of which is m(Y ). Here, we introduce quantity s, and call it safety,
and posit that the reaction force R is given by

R = r · g · M.

R = s · g · m(Y ).

(iii) Here, the reaction force is a sum of the reaction force from the Cases I and II,

R = r · g · M + s · g · m(Y ).

To simplify our argument we assume that the reaction force R is uniform in the following sense. In regard to (i) and
(ii), or to (ii) and (iii), the reaction r and the safety s are assumed to be constants independent of location Y along
the building. The uniformity assumption simpliﬁes the analysis great deal as it allows us to explore the behavior of
the collapse of the building with respect to only two averaged parameters s and r.

We see that for the building itself to be standing and safe absent any other load, it is necessary that

i.e., for each ﬂoor the total reaction force has to be greater than the weight of the building above it. For (i) this
means r > 1, for (ii) this means s > 1, while for (iii), it is necessary that r + s > 1. Obviously, these values have to
be greater than unity for building to carry people and their support.

R > g · m(Y ),

B. Model

The equation of motion for the avalanche of mass m = m(Y ) which at collapse front Y destroys the stationary part

of the building reads

With the help of Eq. (1), this can be expanded in a second order ordinary diﬀerential equation (ODE)

We make Eq. (10) more amenable to analysis by converting it to a dimensionless form. That is, we scale every mass
with M , the total mass of the building, scale all positions with the height of the building H, and scale all times with
the characteristic free-fall time T , where

As the result of scaling, the original variables of the problem, t, Y, ˙Y , ¨Y are replaced by dimensionless variables

III.

INITIAL CONDITIONS FOR THE SIMPLE COLLAPSE MODEL(14)

The ODE’s (14) cannot be solved analytically except in some very special cases that are mostly of academic interest.
Rather, we turn to numerical methods to solve them. As is known, this requires specifying the initial conditions for the
function y = y(τ ). As the ODE’s, Eq.(14), are all of the second degree in function y = y(τ ) we need two conditions,
namely, initial position y0 = y(0) and initial velocity y′
0 = y′(0). Here, we assume that the collapse started at time
τ = 0.

We apply the model to the collapse of WTC 2 as described in the 9/11 commission report, whereby the collapse
started because the ﬂoors damaged by the impact could not support the weight of the building above. There was
no attempt in the commission report to make a quantitative estimate of neither how much the impacted ﬂoors were
damaged in the collision, nor how much damage the ﬂoors below suﬀered. This prompted some authors, e.g., Eager
and Musso5, to be more quantitative: they estimated the amount of damage to the impacted area for the ﬂoors to
collapse, and discussed the (lack of) factors, namely that the sub-optimal mixture of the jet fuel and air, burning
for a short duration of time, might not produce enough temperature and heat to cause a catastrophic failure of the
building material.

We circumvent this debate, by making somewhat drastic assumption

Between the ﬂoors F1 and F2 the building was so badly damaged that it lost any and all structural integrity.
That is, for the impacted section of the building R ≡ 0.

The reaction force R is thus

As already said, it is not clear what are the minimal reasonable values for the parameters r and s for the section of
the building below the impact area. We return to that point later when we analyze the behavior of the avalanche for
all r, s > 0.

In general, let us assume that a building has a total number of ﬂoors FT , and that it was hit by an airplane between
the ﬂoors F1 and F2, where F1 ≤ F2. If the damaged ﬂoors could not support the weight of the building above them,
then the avalanche most likely started at the top of the impact area,

The avalanche is initially at rest, so

In our model, the distribution of ﬂoors in the building is uniform throughout the height and we avoid other features
the building may have had, e.g., the height of the foyer, or the mass of the base of the building compared to its
mass per unit height in the upper part. As a result, the position of the ﬂoors in the model is lower than that in the
actual building, and the height of the individual ﬂoors is similarly greater. The eﬀect of the approximation is that
it overestimates the mass of the core of the avalanche and the height of the impact zone, thus giving the avalanche
more mass and more room to gain momentum for the destruction of building below.

FIG. 2: Typical solutions for the uniform reaction model, Eq. (14a), for initial conditions given by Eqs. (19). Discontinuity in
acceleration (dashed green line) occurs when the avalanche hits the part of the building below the impact area. Shown are the
cases r = 0.5 (left panel) and r = 0.25 (right panel). As can be seen the building collapses in ﬁnite time if r < 0.5, while for
r ≥ 0.5 it remains standing.

The general behavior of all solutions of ODE’s (14) for position y = y(τ ), velocity y′ = y′(τ ) and acceleration
y′′ = y′′(τ ) is shown in Figs. 2 and 3. The avalanche starts with the acceleration equal to g, but then the acceleration
drops down in magnitude as the avalanche consumes the impacted ﬂoors. When the avalanche hits the part of the
building below the impact its acceleration suﬀers a sudden positive jump that comes from the discontinuity of R at
Y = H · F1/FT . As the avalanche moves on its acceleration does not change discontinuously any more.

We ﬁrst examine the models where we assume that the damage to the building is localized to the impact area,
while below it is in its original state (r > 1, s > 1, or r + s > 1, depending on the model). We ﬁnd that in this case
the avalanche does not reach ground zero. Rather, it stops after traversing a few ﬂoors. Only in the uniform safety
model the avalanche can reach ground zero if s is in the range 1 ≤ s ≤ 1.05. Here, the upper bound of 1.05 is a
consequence of the initial conditions and of the assumption that the reaction force in impacted section is zero. The
times this takes, however, are greater than ∼ 3 · T , and thus nowhere close to the observed 1.2 · T , where T is the
free-fall time.

To reach the observed total collapse time we thus have to consider the values of the parameters r, or s, or both,
below the unitary threshold. Our model, featuring a single collapse front, in principle cannot describe the building in
such sub-critical conditions, because then an avalanche should form at any location where the force due to the load is

greater than the reaction force. We observe, however, that the collapse of WTC 2 occurred through a single avalanche.
Inconsistency between the two, necessity of sub-critical conditions to reach the total collapse time and the apparent
collapse in a single avalanche, is removed if we allow for the sub-critical conditions in the building to be delivered
moments before the collapse. With this scenario in mind we thus explore the sub-critical regime by considering the
parameters r and s below the unitary threshold.

Typical solutions of the uniform reaction model, Eq. (14a), are shown in Fig. 2. For the building to collapse in ﬁnite
times it is required that r ≤ 0.5. The result of calculation of total collapse time given the initial conditions (19) is
shown in Fig. 4, together with the estimated collapse time of WTC 2 of 1.2 · T . As can be seen, the collapse of the
building according to the uniform reaction model requires r ≃ 0.1 to meet that time. Typical solutions of the uniform
safety model, Eq. (14b), are shown in Fig. 3. Here the building collapses to ground zero in ﬁnite times if s ≤ 1.05.
The total collapse time as a function of s and given the initial conditions (19) is shown in Fig. 4, together with the
estimated collapse time of WTC 2 of 1.2 · T . The collapse of the building according to the uniform safety model

V. CONCLUSION

We conclude that in a tall building like WTC 2 a single avalanche may form under the conditions such as those
following the airplane impact. The avalanche can propagate a few ﬂoors, at best, before it comes to a stop. The
avalanche cannot reach ground zero, however, if the damage is localized only to the impacted ﬂoors. For the avalanche
to develop and consume whole building in the time of ∼ 1.2 · T extremely high levels of damage to the ﬂoors that
were not directly aﬀected by the airplane collision are required. If such a damage were delivered slowly to the whole
building, this would have initiated one or possibly few slower avalanches sooner. This did not happen, so judging
by the magnitude of the damage that had to be delivered rapidly to the building moments before the collapse, we
conclude that the airplane impact could not have been a sole culprit for the catastrophy. Rather, we surmise that there
was a wave of massive destruction (WMD) propagating throughout the building in the wake of which the avalanche
formed. The WMD most likely started somewhere between the impacted ﬂoors and the middle of the building in
a big explosion, which destroyed a number of ﬂoors to create a core of an avalanche. The WMD then propagated
downwards destroying 70-90% of load-bearing capacity of the ﬂoors that were shortly thereafter consumed by the
avalanche.

In other words, the scenario suggested by the 9/11 commission, where the building collapses in a single avalanche

in the near-free-fall times, is physically impossible unless other sources of damage to the building are identiﬁed.

0. Such an extent of damage cannot be explained by the airplane collision that damaged the ﬂoors between F 1 and F 2.

Finally, it is worth noting that the one-dimensional model presented here overestimates the energies involved in the
motion of avalanche. That is, allowing the core of the avalanche to move in other two directions, as well, would open
the paths for its kinetic and potential energy to be diverted into the tipping or the rotation of the top part. This
would in turn decrease the energy available for destruction of the ﬂoors below. Additionally, in a multidimensional
collapse/avalanche model the straight-down motion is unstable. Considering that the strongest part of WTC 2 was
its center, a random change in the way the ﬂoors at the collapse front failed would have scattered the avalanche and
disperse the collapse front. This stability question does not arise, however, if the building is pulled rather than pushed
to the ground, which goes back to the hypothetical WMD.

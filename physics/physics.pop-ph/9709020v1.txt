Another Dash into the Record Books (wind: -2.1 m/s)

J. R. Mureika

Los Angeles, CA 90089-2520

When I ﬁrst performed some of the analysis herein, I thought: “Wow!
Bailey gets another title!”. Unfortunately, that was before August 3rd, and
the 100m ﬁnal in Athens. Now, Donovan Bailey doesn’t hold the World
sprint crown. It’s slipped and fallen south of the border (your border, that
is!). Maurice Greene, a relative unknown with a PB of 10.43s three years
ago, reigned victorious at 9.86s, matching the third best legal clocking ever.
But, the events of that day didn’t change the overall result of my work.
By virtue of the race in question, some would say that Bailey is no longer
the “World’s Fastest Man”. But has he lost his place in the record books
altogether? Currently, the 9.84s from Atlanta is still holding strong. Can’t
we say more about our current international sprint sensation?

The truth is: not only can we say more about Bailey (who still seems
to have the knack of saying too much about his competition!), but we can
say something great about the “Blast oﬀ! guy” himself (to quote Bogdan
Poprawski), Robert Esmie, perhaps our sprint celebrity for Syndey in 2000?
Following the National Championships in Abbotsford, the media jumped
all over Bailey’s winning performance. The World Record holder had run a
mediocre, sub-par 10.03s, well oﬀ his 9.84 WR performance of 1996. Even
a medal hope looked grim for the defending champion, who was himself
displeased with his race, moaning and groaning of leg injuries and viruses.
In defense of his prodigy, Texas-based coach Dan Pfaﬀ was quick to lash
back at the media, highlighting the underplayed fact that Bailey’s run was
into a head-wind, and a strong one at that: -2.1 m/s! He denounced the
ongoing criticism of the time, and ventured to guess that it would probably
correspond to about 9.90s under ideal conditions.

Taking a note from Pfaﬀ, I quickly crunched this data in my wind-
correction formula, which was presented in the July 1997 issue of Athletics
[1]. 10.03s (how mediocre!), and -2.1 m/s... Suﬃce it to say, Dan Pfaﬀ was
wrong. Bailey hadn’t run a 9.90, nor had he even clocked anything in the
9.9 range. In fact, Bailey had cruised to a 9.89s still-air equivalent! At the
time, this ranked him as the world leader on my wind-correction tables, nu-
merically matching the legal world leader, Ato Boldon’s early season 9.89s

1

from Modesto, CA (run with a +0.8 m/s tailwind, a 9.94s still-air sprint;
see Table 5).

Yet another home-town boy does good!

If Bailey’s head-wind charge of 10.03s was actually a blistering 9.89s,
what then became of the other times? Table 2 tells all: Robert Esmie
(unoﬃcially) joined the elite club of sub-10s sprinters, with his 10.10s in
Abbotsford translating to a 9.96s still-air dash. Bruny Surin was knocking
at the door of the club with a 10.01s equivalent, but couldn’t quite get in this
year. Not only was Esmie’s silver medal performance good enough to put
him unoﬃcially under 10s, it also ranks him (as of the World Championships)
sixth best in the world, behind Tim Montgomery, Frank Fredericks, Boldon,
Bailey, and Greene (see Table 3)!

What’s interesting about that top 6 group of athletes? Several things.
Two are from Canada, and two are from the US – Canada ties the US for
number of top 6 100m sprinters! What else is intersting? Robert Esmie
*doesn’t* train or live in the United States, a fact shared by the remaining
athletes (Fredericks earned a CS degree from BYU in Provo, Utah) which
was quickly pointed out in NBC’s coverage of the World Championships.
Blast oﬀ indeed – chalk one up for the Canadians!

Alas, poor Bailey: I knew him, Horatio

August 3rd, 1997: the king is dead! Long live the king. Well, dead? I
don’t think so. More like a minor strain. But the media was quick to dig
Bailey’s grave for him. The Americans once again captured the sprints. I was
surprised the reporters didn’t hail Bailey’s second place ﬁnish as “mediocre”:
he only won the silver! The golden 9.84 was still intact, with Greene missing
the target by 0.02s. Was he really that far oﬀ the mark, though? Table4
reveals an awful truth. Greene’s 9.86s (+0.2 m/s) corrects to roughly 9.88s,
which coincidentally is what a 9.84s with a +0.7 m/s wind becomes! Shall
we presume that the Greek god of wind was sitting in our corner on that
fateful Sunday in Athens?

What of the other sub-9.90s performances this year, or even for all-
time? Table 5 hints that the tail-wind has betrayed Leroy Burrell, King
Carl, Boldon, and Fredericks, whose apparent sub-9.90s were all but same.
However, Burrell did manage to make it under that barrier, but it wasn’t
with his then-WR 9.85s (+1.2 m/s) from Lausanne, nor his 9.88s (also +1.2)

2

from the ’91 WCs in Tokyo. Rather, a seemingly average 9.97s into a 1.3
m/s head-wind in the Barcelona ’92 semi-ﬁnals earned him that spot as a
calm 9.89s (a mark which is oﬃcially ranked almost 80th on the all-time
list!).

And so, Greene takes the lead in the 1997 wind-corrected rankings, albeit
by a mere 0.01s over Bailey (who, in all fairness, was a mere 0.01s in front
of formidable Boldon’s 9.90s in actual still-air conditions at Stuttgart – no
wind-correction needed!). But all is not lost for the good guys. Upon further
inspection of Table 4, one notes that only one name appears twice: Bailey.
While Burrell, Fredericks, and Boldon have each legally run sub-9.90s twice,
Bailey is the only one who holds that title after all is wind-corrected!

What a race was the 1997 Canadian Championships men’s 100m ﬁnal!
If we’re to believe the wind-correction ﬁgures, it propelled Bailey to be the
sole individual to hold two sub-9.90s still-air races, gave Robert Esmie a
sub-10s run to tuck under his belt, and put Canada on an even par with the
US for number of top 6 sub-10s world-class sprinters.

Would the real World’s Fastest Man please step forward?

As I write this article, there is just over a month remaining in the 1997
Grand Prix season. Bailey is back in force, stating in a post-relay victory
interview with NBC that his “To do” list for the remainder of the season
included: break World Record. Two legal 9.91s in the same day while injured
and after coming oﬀ a virus isn’t too shabby!

With Boldon and Greene also pushing their limits, and Fredericks lurking
in the shadows, these lists may be out of date by the time they hit the stands.
Given the right conditions, it is very likely that we’ll see the 9.84 knocked
down a couple notches. As to how far, and more importantly, by whom?
Currently, almost any of these individuals can claim the title of “World’s
Fastest Man” by some deﬁnition or another. Although Greene holds the
World Championship title, and in capturing gold posted the fastest time of
the year (both wind-corrected and oﬃcial), Bailey still retains his WR and
has clocked the most sub-9.90s races ever after wind-correction. Meanwhile,
Boldon holds the most legal sub-9.90s performances of 1997, and has run
the fastest ever 100m/200m one-day combo (9.90/19.77 in Stuttgart). As for
Fredericks: he’s the current wind-corrected WR holder at 9.84s (Lausanne
1996).

Running at their current seasonal bests, a 9.83s mark can be made by
Greene with a +0.8 m/s wind, Bailey with a +1.0, and Boldon with a +1.3

3

m/s tail boost. Fredericks is currently out of the running with his 9.97s,
which would require an illegal +2.4 m/s aid. Of course, their current best
eﬀorts may not be their ﬁnal best eﬀorts for ’97, so anything can happen.
As of the Zurich GP (13 Aug), Bailey says he’s throwing in the towel for
’97 due to ongoing injuries – but truth and ﬁction can sometimes be hard
to discern when it comes to his injuries. Word on the track had it that
he couldn’t even jog down the straight a week prior to the 100m ﬁnal in
Atlanta...

Which one of our contestants holds the key? It’ll be most exciting to
ﬁnd out. By the time you read this article (to paraphrase Ed McMahon):
“Someone may already be a winner!”.

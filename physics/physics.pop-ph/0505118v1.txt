INTRODUCTION
It is well known that “equivalent” sprint race times run
with diﬀerent accompanying wind speeds or at diﬀerent
altitudes are anything but equivalent races. Adjusting
these times for atmospheric drag eﬀects has been the
including but not limited
focus of many past studies,
to [1,2,3,4,5] and references therein. The drag force
acting on a sprinter running at speed v in a wind w is
a function of air density and the relative wind speed,
Fdrag ∝ ρair(v − w)2, where density has traditionally been
calculated using the race venue’s elevation above sea level.

However, air density variation is dependent on more
than just altitude. This work will quantify how changes in
air temperature, barometric pressure, and humidity levels
inﬂuence 100 m sprint performances. These variables col-
lectively determine an eﬀective altitude known as density
altitude, which depending on atmospheric conditions can
be signiﬁcantly diﬀerent than a venue’s physical elevation
above sea level. The density of hot air is low, yielding a
higher density altitude and thus simulating and increase in
physical altitude. Increased humidity levels have a similar
eﬀect. Conversely, colder temperatures and lower humid-
ity can potentially simulate a decrease in physical altitude.

METHODS
The numerical model of sprinting performances used in
Reference [4] is modiﬁed using standard hydrodynamic
principles to include the eﬀects of air temperature,
pressure, and humidity levels on aerodynamic drag.
Race times are obtained by numerically-integrating the
associated equations for various temperatures in the range
15-35◦, relative humidity levels (RH) between 0 and 100%,
and atmospheric pressures between 85-105 kPa. These
calculations are performed for wind speeds between -3 m/s
and +3 m/s. The resulting data are then compared to a
deﬁned standard race with no wind, sea level atmospheric
pressure and temperature of 25◦.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Temperature alone does not have a profound impact on the
simulations, giving a performance diﬀerential of 0.02 s over
the 20◦range. Wind and physical altitude corrections un-
der these conditions are thus essentially identical to those
discussed in the literature, conﬁrming the earlier result of
[3]. The combined eﬀect of relative humidity and temper-
ature plays a slightly more crucial role in adjusting per-
formances, since the air density of hot, saturated air is
signiﬁcantly lower than that of colder dry air.

When the eﬀects of pressure, temperature, and relative
humidity changes are considered in combination, the

performances equivalent to a “standard” 9.70 second 100 m
sprint at sea-level with no wind for extreme high-pressure (top
curve) and low pressure (bottom curve) conditions.

corrections to performances can be very large. Figure 1
shows the range of possible simulation times, bounded by
times run in extreme conditions: 85 kPa, 100% RH, and
35◦ (yielding the least dense atmosphere) and 105 kPa,
0% RH, 15◦ (most dense). The race times vary by up to or
over 0.1 seconds between these extremes even after wind
correction is taken into account. The results suggest that
a non-negligible diﬀerence in race times can be expected
for “equivalent” performances run with the same wind
speed at the same venue or physical altitude, but under
diﬀerent atmospheric conditions.

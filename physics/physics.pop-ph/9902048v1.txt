Abstract

The conventional discussion of apparent distortions of space and time in Special
Relativity (the Lorentz-Fitzgerald Contraction and Time Dilatation) is extended by
considering observations of : (i) moving objects of limited lifetime in their own rest
frame (‘transient luminous objects’) and (ii) a moving extended array of synchro-
nised ‘equivalent clocks’ in a common inertial frame. Application of the Lorentz
Transformation to (i) shows that such objects, viewed with coarse time resolu-
tion, appear to be longer in the direction of the relative velocity ~v by a factor
(v/c)2 (Space Dilatation) and to (ii) that the moving equivalent clock that
1/
appears at any ﬁxed position in the rest frame of an inertial observer appears to be
(v/c)2 (Time Con-
running faster than a similar clock at rest by the factor 1/
traction). The actual appearance of moving objects and clocks, taking into account
light propagation time delays, as well as the eﬀect of the Lorentz Transformation,
is also discussed.

Introduction

In his 1905 paper on Special Relativity [1]Einstein showed that Time Dilatation (TD)
and the Lorentz-Fitzgerald Contraction (LFC), which had previously been introduced in
a somewhat ad hoc way into Classical Electrodynamics, are simple consequences of the
Lorentz Transformation (LT), that is, of the geometry of space-time.

As an example of the LFC Einstein stated that a sphere moving with velocity v would,
( v
c )2 in
‘viewed from the stationary system’, appear to be contracted by the factor
its direction of motion where c is the velocity of light in free space. It was only pointed
out some 54 years later that if ‘viewed’ was interpreted in the conventional sense of ‘as
seen by the eye, or recorded on a photograph’ then the sphere does not at all appear
to be contracted, but is still seen as a sphere with the same dimensions as a stationary
one and at the same position [2, 3, 4] ! It was shown in general [3, 4] that transversely
viewed moving objects subtending a small solid angle at the observer appear to be not
distorted in shape or changed in size, but rather rotated, as compared to a similarly
viewed and orientated object at rest. This apparent rotation is a consequence of three
distinct physical eﬀects:

(i) The LFC.

(ii) Optical Aberration.

object.

(iii) Diﬀerent propagation times of photons emitted by diﬀerent parts of the moving

The eﬀect (ii) may be interpreted as the change in direction of photons, emitted by a
moving source, due to the LT between the rest frames of the source and the stationary
observer. Correcting for (ii) and (iii), the LFC can be deduced as a physical eﬀect, if not
directly observed. It was also pointed out by Weinstein [5] that if a single observer is
close to a moving object then, because of the eﬀect of light propagation time delays it
will appear elongated if moving towards the observer and contracted (to an extent greater
than the LFC) if moving away. Only an object moving strictly transversely to the line of
sight of a close observer shows the LFC.

However, the LFC itself is a physical phenomenon similar in many ways to (iii) above.
A photograph or the human eye record as a sharp image the photons incident on it at a
ﬁxed time. That is, the image corresponds to a projection at constant time in the frame
S of observation. This implies that the photons constituting the image are emitted at
diﬀerent times from the diﬀerent parts, along the line of sight, of an extended object. The
LFC is similarly deﬁned by a ﬁxed time projection in the frame S. The LT then requires
that the photons constituting the image of a moving object are also emitted at diﬀerent
times, in the rest frame S’ of the object, from the diﬀerent parts along its direction of
motion. In the following S will, in general, denote the reference frame of a ‘stationary’
observer (space-time coordinates x,y,z,t) while S’ refers to the rest frame of an object
moving with uniform velocity v relative to S ( space-time coordinates x’,y’,z’,t’).

The purpose of this paper is to point out that the t = constant projection of the LFC

1

and the x′ = constant projection of TD are not the only physically distinct Space Time
Measurements (STM) possible within Special Relativity. In fact, as will be demonstrated
below, there are two others: Space Dilatation (SD), the t′ = constant projection and
Time Contraction (TC), the x = constant projection. The overall situation with respect
to apparent distortions of space-time is thus symmetric with respect to space and time.
The t = constant projection of the LFC is the STM appropriate to the ‘moving bodies’ of
Einstein’s original paper and to the photographic recording technique. This medium has
no intrinsic time resolution and relies on that provided by a rapidly moving shutter to
provide a clear image. The LFC ‘works’ as a well deﬁned physical phenomenon because
the ‘measuring rod’ or other physical object under observation has a lifetime that is long
in comparison with the time interval required to make an observation, and so constitutes
a continuous source of emitted or reﬂected photons, such that some are always available
in the diﬀerent space (∆x′) and time (∆t′) intervals in S’ for every position of the rod
corresponding to the time interval ∆t around t = constant in the observer’s frame S.
If, however, the physical object of interest has internal motion (rotation, expansion or
contraction) or is only illuminated, in its rest frame S’, during a short time interval, the
above conditions, that assure that the t = constant projection gives a well deﬁned STM
no longer apply. In the following, for brevity, all such objects of limited luminous lifetime
in their own rest frame will be referred to as ‘Transient Luminous Objects’ or TLO. For
such objects it is natural to deﬁne a length measurement by taking the t′ = constant
projection in S’.

Space time measurements of such transient luminous objects are discussed below in
Section 3. A simple conceptual camera of ﬁnite time resolution is considered. Practical
examples are a ﬂash camera or a TV raster. The camera is used to record Image Plane
Coordinates (IPC) xI, yI, tI in the observation frame S. To orient the discussion answers
will be sought to the question: ‘What information about transient luminous objects ( ob-
served in general as a correlated ensemble of STM in the frame S) such as its distance,
shape, orientation or lifetime can be derived only from measurements of the image plane
coordinates? The case of stationary objects is ﬁrst considered in Section 2, followed by
the discussion of uniformly (transversely) moving objects in the following Section.

In Section 4 time measurements other than the conventional TD (x′ = constant pro-
jection) of Special Relativity are considered. The TD phenomenon refers only to a local
clock, in the sense that its position in the frame S’ is invariant (say at the spatial origin of

coordinates). However the time recorded by any synchronised clock in the same inertial
frame is, by deﬁnition, identical. Einstein used such an array of ‘equivalent clocks’ situated

at diﬀerent positions in the same inertial frame in his original discussion of the relativity
of simultanaeity [1]. The question addressed in Section 4 is: What will an observer in S

see if he looks not only at a given local clock in S’, but also at other equivalent clocks at
diﬀerent positions in S’, in comparison to a standard clock at rest in his own frame? It
is shown that such equivalent clocks may be seen to run slower than, or faster than, the
TD prediction for a local clock. In particular they may even appear to run faster than
the standard clock. This is an example of the Time Contraction eﬀect mentioned above.

2 Space Time Measurements of Transient Luminous

Objects at Rest

It is part of common experience that distant objects appear smaller than similar ones
that are close to the observer. This is because the human visual system functions as
a camera.
In Fig 1 is shown a schematic camera where a number of planar objects
OA,OB,OC,OD of diﬀerent shape, orientation and distance produce an identical image (a
square) in the image plane of the camera. The lens of the latter will be considered in the
following discussion to be a simple pin-hole. If the size and orientation of the object is
known then its distance l from the position L of the camera lens along the z-axis may
be deduced from measurements of its image by simple geometry. For example a rod of
known length r, whose centre lies on the z-axis, and is orientated parallel to OxI is at the
distance l = rf /rI where rI is the length of the image of the rod and f is the distance
between the lens and the image plane of the camera.

The problem addressed now is how the real dimensions and positions of a physical
object may, in general, be deduced only from measurements made in the image plane of
the camera shown in Fig 1. One possiblity is to send a pulse of light with a sharp time
distribution at a known time from a source near the camera and to measure the time delay
and the positions of the photons scattered back into the camera. This is the principle
of Radar ranging measurements. Here a diﬀerent, although related, method will be used
where the camera requires no external time reference. In the present Section the method
will be applied to objects at rest relative to the camera, while in the following Section it

is applied to objects in uniform transverse motion with respect to the camera axis. In
this case eﬀects of Special Relativity must be taken into account.

Two diﬀerent lamps L1, L2 are used to illuminate the object of interest with a sharp
pulse of light whose width must be smaller than d/c where d is the typical transverse
dimension of the object. The lamps L1, L2 are used as a source of correlated space-time
events in the rest frame of the object of interest, that is to produce a TLO of well deﬁned
properties. They are not however essential for the following considerations. The surfaces
of the objects could just as well be equipped with an array of discrete light sources (e.g.
light-emitting diodes) programmed so as to emit light pulses at diﬀerent values of t′, the
proper time of the object, depending on their position.

The lamp L1 is situated in such a position that the photons scattered from diﬀerent
parts of the surface arrive simulaneously at the image plane of the camera 1. That is
the position of the lamp is such that the ‘trivial’ light propagation time diﬀerences from
diﬀerent parts of the object to the camera are compensated. If L1 lies in the plane spanned
by the z-axis and a normal to the surface of the object, then the angle ε (Fig 2) is given
by:

ε = cos−1(

sin α
cos δ

)

(2.1)

The lamp L2 is placed along the normal to the surface of the object on the same side as
the camera. Thus the scattering time of the signal from L2 corresponds to a ﬁxed proper
time in the rest frame of the (planar) object. In order that the light from the lamps may

enter the camera in the absence of specular reﬂection the surfaces of the objects should
be diﬀuse reﬂectors. If the lamps are suﬃciently distant the impinging light pulse can be
considered to be a narrow planar wave packet.

For each of the objects OA-OD the light pulse from L1 gives a sharp (in time) square
image in the camera (Fig 3c). No information is therefore available as to which of the
four objects in Fig 1 produced the image. For the lamp L2, because of light propagation
time diﬀerences, each object produces a clearly distinguishable image, a line moving in
a distinct direction, the extremities of which sweep out the same square outline (Figs
3a,b,d) or, for OC, an instantaneous square image indistinguishable 2 from that produced
by the lamp L1 (Fig 3c). The orientation of the moving line image deﬁnes that of the
surface of the object. It is perpendicular to the projection of the normal to the surface on
to the image plane. It is now demonstrated that analysis of the time dependant images
of OA, OB, OD enables each object to be spatially reconstructed. Allowing for light
propagation delays, the ensemble of space-time points constituting the TLO may then
also be calculated.

As an example the image produced by OD using the lamp L2 is now analysed. The
times for the line to move from the right extremity of the square to the centre, and from
the centre to the left extremity are denoted by ∆t1, ∆t2 respectively. With LQ = l, and
other geometrical deﬁnitions as in Fig 4a, then:

special case. Since ∆tL2

3 Space Time Measurements of Transient Luminous

Objects in Uniform Transverse Motion

The observation of the object OD described in the previous Section is is now repeated
in the case that OD and the lamps L1,L2 are moving with a constant velocity v = βc
relative to the camera and parallel to OxI. A coordinate system is deﬁned in the moving
frame S’ with origin at Q and axes Qx′, Qy′, Qz′ parallel to OxI, OyI, Oz (Fig 4). The
frame, at rest relative to the camera, whose origin coincides with Q at t = t′ = 0, and with
x and y axes parallel to OxI and OyI respectively is denoted by S. It is further assumed
that the light pulses from L1 and L2 arrive at Q at time t′ = 0. To calculate the moving
image observed in the camera under these conditions the light propagation times found
in the previous Section may be used after ﬁrst performing the LT of space-time points
beween the frames S and S’:

second terms account for light propagation delays between the object and the camera.
The γ, β dependent terms in the latter are also a consequence of the LT, that changes the

It is convenient to introduce the quantities dI for the width of the image observed with
coarse time resolution and ∆t = ∆t1 + ∆t2 the full time over which the moving image

object side and the dashed rectangles or squares indicate the full areas swept out by the
moving line images. It is evident from Figs 5 and 6 that the images have a complicated
structure as a function of β, but qualitatively they do not diﬀer from those of a similar
object at rest. For β > 0 (< 0) the line image moves to the left (right). For tan α < 1

For tan α > 1, dI vanishes for some positive value of β ( Figs. 5c,6c), and ∆t has a
second zero for positive β (by construction, it of course vanishes for β = 0 and any α).
When tan α = 2, ∆t vanishes for β = 0.8. The instantaneous image is then identical
to that obtained for β = 0.
It is easily shown, using Eqns.(3.9),(3.11), that the same
instantaneous image is obtained when ∆t = 0 for any tan α > 1. Note that, because
of the approximations made above, Eqns.(3.9),(3.11) are not valid for β

In the above discussion optical aberration has been neglected and it is assumed that
the camera is still sensitive for large values of β where the observed photons have a large
red-shift. Denoting by θ, θ’ the angles in the S, S’ frames of the diﬀusely reﬂected photons
relative to the x, x’ axes, the LT of the photon momentum leads to the relation :

tan θ =

In order to enter the camera the photons must have θ

α, then (see Fig2.) the photons cannot be diﬀusely reﬂected from
the surface of the object. This leads, for any value of α, to a maximum value of β for
diﬀuse reﬂection. For tan α = 1/2, 1, 2 as in Figs.5,6 βM AX = 0.88, 0.707, 0.440. If the
object is translucent, or equipped with a lamp similarly situated to L1, but illuminating
the back surface of the object (i.e. placed at the position the mirror image of L1 in the
object) then the above limitation is avoided. For β > βM AX the photons entering the
camera originate entirely from reﬂection on the surface remote from the camera. This is
just the optical aberration eﬀect referred to in the Introduction that leads to the apparent
rotation of of rapidly moving objects [2, 3, 4]. No such restriction applies for negative
values of β and in this case the photons are always reﬂected from the front surface of the
object.

Since (compare Figs.3,5,7) the images of stationary and moving TLO are not distigu-
ishable, and the moving image is deﬁned by just three independent quantities (say ∆t1,
∆t2 and dI) whereas four (for example d1, α, l and v ) are needed to completely specify
the moving planar object, image plane measurements using only one lamp do not enable
reconstruction of the object. It suﬃces however to perform measurements, under identical
conditions, using separately L1 and L2 to derive the true dimensions, orientation, position
and velocity of the object3. From Eqns.(3.9,3.10):

4 Space Time Measurements of Equivalent Moving

Clocks

In this Section space time measurements of an array of synchronised clocks situated
in the inertial frame S’ will be considered. These clocks may be synchronised by any
convenient procedure 4 (see for example Ref.[1]). For an observer in S’ all such clocks
are ‘equivalent’ in the sense that each of them records, independently of its position, the
proper time τ ′ of the frame S’. For convenience, the array of clocks is assumed to be
placed on the wagons of a train which is at rest in S’, as shown in Fig.9a. The clocks
1, 0, 1, 2, ... and are situated (with the exception of the
are labelled Cm , m = ...
‘magic clocks’ CM , C M , see below) at ﬁxed distances L from each other, along the Ox’
axis, which is parallel to the train. Any observer in S’ will, after making the necessary
corrections for Light Propagation Time Delays (LPTD), note that each Equivalent Clock
(EC) indicates the same time, as shown in Fig.9a. It is now asked how the array of EC
will appear to an observer at a ﬁxed position in the frame S when the train is moving
with velocity βc parallel to the direction Ox in S (Fig.9b). It is assumed that the EC C0
is placed at x′ = 0 and that it is synchronised with the Standard Clock CS, placed at

they are situated in the same inertial frame.

The appearence of the moving EC to an observer in S (after correction for LPTD;
their actual appearence, including this eﬀect, is considered later) at t = 0 is shown in
Fig.9b, and in more detail in Fig.10 for both t = 0 and t = τ . The period τ is the time
between the passage of successive EC past CS. The big hand of CS in Fig.10 rotates
through 180◦ during the time τ . Explicit expressions for the apparent times are presented
in Table 5. In Fig.9b,10 the times indicated by the clocks are shown for β = 0.6. These
apparent times are readily calculated using the LT equations (3.1),(3.2). Consider the
time indicated by C1 at t = 0. The space-time points are:

As shown in Fig 9b, the wagons of the train are apparently shorter due to the LFC eﬀect
(Eqn.(4.4)) and also the wagons at the front end of the train are seen at an earlier time
than those at the rear end. Thus a t = 0 snapshot in S corresponds, not to a ﬁxed t′ in
S’ but one which depends on x′: t′ =
βx′/c. This is a consequence of the relativity of
simultaneity of space-time events in S and S’, as ﬁrst pointed out by Einstein in Ref.[1].
Here it appears in a particularly graphic and striking form. The part of the space-time
domain in S’ that may be observed from S is considered in detail below. Consider now
the time indicated by C−1 at t = τ , i.e. when C−1 is at the origin of S. The space-time
points are:

The EC at the origin of S at t = τ indicates a later time than CS i.e.
it is apparently
running faster than CS. This is an example of Time Contraction (TC). As shown below
TC is exhibited by the EC at any ﬁxed position in S. In fact, if the observer in S can see
the EC only when they are near to CS he (or she) will inevitably conclude that the clocks
on the train run fast, not slow as in the classical TD eﬀect (see below). Suppose that the
observer is sitting in a waiting room with the clock CS and notices the time on the train
(the same as CS) by looking at C0 as it passes the waiting room window. If he (or she)
then compares C−1 as it passes the window with CS it will be seen to be running fast
relative to the latter. In order to see the TD eﬀect the observer would (as will now be
shown), have to note the time shown by, for example C0, at time t = τ as recorded by CS.
Indeed, to do this he would ﬁrst have to correct his observation for the LPTD between
himself and C0. At time t = τ at CS he would actually see C0 as it appeared at an earlier
time to a nearby observer in S. Using Eqn.(4.8),Eqn.(4.3) may be written as [C1(t = 0)]:

with the solutions [ C0(t = τ ) ]:

t′ = τ /γ
x = vτ = L/γ

So the EC C0 at time t = τ indicates an earlier time, and so is apparently running slower
than CS. This is the classical Time Dilatation (TD) eﬀect. It applies to observations of
all local clocks in S’,(i.e. those situated at a ﬁxed value of x′) as well as any other EC
that has the same value of x′.

As a last example consider the ‘Magic Clock’ CM shown in Fig 9a at time t = τ . With

the space-time points:

Eqns.(3.1),(3.2) give:

t′ = τ

where the relation L = γvτ from Eqn.(4.14) has been used. Thus CM indicates the same
time as CS at t = τ . Similar ‘Magic Clocks’ can be deﬁned that show the same time as CS
at any chosen time t in S. Such a clock is, in general, situated at x′ =
1)/βγ. All
of the other apparent times presented in Table 5 and shown in Figs. 9b, 10 are calculated
in a similar way to the above examples by choosing appropriate values of x′ and t.

It is straightforward to derive a general formula for the apparent time of any EC, Cm
after the passage of an arbitary number j of wagons past the clock CS. Still neglecting

This is the general TC eﬀect for an EC at ﬁxed n (x = constant). Eqn.(4.22) may also
be used to calculate the apparent time delay between the EC on successive wagons at a
ﬁxed time in S :

The eﬀects of LPTD on the apparent times indicated by the clocks on the moving
train will now be taken into account. Only propagation times parallel to the train are
considered and it is assumed that the clocks are orientated in such away that they can be
seen by an observer placed beside CS. Consider the clock Cn at the time ∆t before the
passage of the jth wagon past CS (Fig.11). If the clock m is at the position xm in S at
this time then the inverse of the LT Eqn.(3.1) gives:

The corresponding time shown by Cm, t′D

m,j is, using the inverse of the LT Eqn.(3.2):

There are now two cases to consider:

(i) xm < 0, Cm approaching the observer;

gives for the apparent time:

Comparing Eqns(4.29),(4.30) with (4.20) it can be seen that, when the LPTD are taken
into account the TD formula for a local clock is replaced by the Relativistic Doppler
Eﬀect formulae Eqns(4.29),(4.30). Actually, for xm < 0 the clock appears to run fast,
not slow. Just, as pointed out in Refs.[2,3,4], a moving sphere does not appear ﬂattened
by the LFC eﬀect, Eqns.(4.29) and (4.30) demonstrate that a moving local clock does
not show the TD eﬀect. Weinstein [5] considered length measurements (for example the
distance between successive clocks on the train in the present example) under the same
conditions as the time measurements decscribed by Eqns.(4.29), (4.30) where a single
observer is close to a moving object. If l0, l denote the lengths of an object viewed in
l0, ∆t′ = l in
S’, S then the relation between l0 and l is given by the replacements τ
Eqns.(4.29),(4.30). Thus an approaching clock (apparently running fast) appears more
distant than a receding clock which is apparently running slow. Neither the LFC nor the
TD eﬀects are directly observed when LPTD are taken into account.

→

It is interesting to note the identity of Eqns.(4.29),(4.30) with the usual Relativistic
Doppler Shift formulae which, following Ref.[1] are usually derived by considering the LT
properties of Electromagnetic Waves. Here they have been derived from considerations
of space-time geometry, as applied to events corresponding to the emission or absorption
of photons. No use is made of the wave concept.

Writing Eqns.(4.27),(4.28) in terms of (n, j) gives the equations:

Both Eqns.(4.31) and (4.32) yield the result:

Thus the TC eﬀect of Eqn(4.23) is unchanged by LPTD corrections (they must clearly
be the same at ﬁxed n or x). The apparent time delay between the clocks on successive
wagons is, including the eﬀect of LPTD :

Comparing with Eqn.(4.24) it can be seen that the LPTD increases the absolute size of
the delay and, for n < 0 ( EC approaching the observer ) changes the sign of the eﬀect.

The eﬀect of LPTD corrections on the clock Cm may be calculated by taking the

Table 6 and Fig 12 is the ‘Magic Clock’ C M situated at x′ = x′

which indicates the same time as CS at t = τ . Table 6 and Fig.12 show the perhaps
surprising result that the EC situated symmetrically in x relative to CS at time t = 0 and
t = τ apparently lag CS by identical times. This is because the time asymmetry between
positive and negative x produced by the LT (see Fig.10) is exactly compensated by the
LPTD. For example. at t = τ the LT gives the result for β = 0.6 that C0 lags CS by 0.2τ .
However, the longer time delay from C−2 as compared to C0 (see Fig.11) means that after
correcting for LPTD, C−2 appears also to lag CS, by just the same amount as C0, which
has a smaller LPTD correction.

Finally in this section the region of the space-time domain of S’, that is visible to
the observer in S is discussed. In particular the space-time observations which may be
made of the wagon holding the EC C0 during the period 0 < t < τ when it is passing
by the Standard Clock CS will be considered. The situation is shown for the three cases:
β = 0.0, 0.6, 0.943 (γ = 1.0, 1.25, 3.0) in Figs 13a),b),c) respectively. For β = 0 the
history of each part of the wagon may be observed in an unbiased manner over the whole
period. When the wagon is moving as in Fig 9b), late times at the front and early times
at the rear of the wagon are no longer observable. The observable region of the (x′, ct′)
plane is only that between the lines L1, L2 (Fig 13b)) where:

As β approaches one (Fig 13c) the observable domain occupies only a narrow region
around the backward light cone of the origin of S’. So, although the wagons of the train
are more concentrated in the ﬁeld of vision of an observer in S, due to the LFC, the

fraction of the total space-time area of S’ that may be observed becomes vanishingly
small. Note that the boundaries of the observable area in the space-time of S’ are easily
read oﬀ from the apparent time of the clocks C−1, C0 recorded in Table 5. Eqns.(4.39) and
(4.40) are derived from Eqn.(4.19) with j = 0, 1 respectively on making the replacements:
= x′/L. The situation shown in Fig 13 Corresponds to the observation
τ
of the train at a distance such that the angle subtended by the wagon between C0 and
C−1 at the observer is small. In this case the eﬀects of LPTD essentially cancel. It is

interesting to compare this with the case of an observer close to the train when the LPTD
of photons moving almost parallel to the train must be taken into account. The (x′, ct′)
domain seen by such an observer, for the same conditions as in Fig 13, is shown in Fig 14.
It is derived in a similar way as for Fig.13, starting from Eqn.(4.28) instead of Eqn.(4.19).
When the train is moving the observable range of t′ is always greater at the rear end
1 the t′ range
(position of C−1) than at the front (position of C0) of the wagon. As β

5 Discussion

The diﬀerent space-time eﬀects (apparent distortions of space or time) in Special
Relativity that have been discussed above are summarised in Table 7. These are the
well-known LFC and TD eﬀects, Space Dilatation (SD) introduced in Section 3 above,
and Time Contraction (TC) introduced in Section 4. Each eﬀect is an observed diﬀerence
∆q (q = x, x′, t, t′) of two space or time coordinates (∆q = q1 −
q2) and corresponds to a
= q) in another of the four variables x, x′, t, t′ of the LT.
constant projection ∆˜q = 0 (˜q
As shown in Table 7, the LFC, SD, TC and TD eﬀects correspond, respectively, to the ∆t,
∆t′, ∆x and ∆x′ projections. After making this projection, the four LT equations give
two relations among the remaining three variables. One of these describes the ‘space-time
distortion’ relating ∆t′ and ∆t or ∆x′ and ∆x while the other gives the equation shown
in the last column, (labelled ‘Complementary Eﬀect’) in Table 7. These equations relate
either ∆x to ∆t (for SD and TD) or ∆x′ to ∆t′ (for LFC and TC). It can be seen from
the Complementary Eﬀect relations that the two space-time points deﬁning the eﬀect (of
space-time distortion) are space-like separated for LFC and SD and time-like separated
for TC and TD.

For example, for the LFC when t1 = t2 = t, the LT equations for the two space-time

points are:

Table 8: The diﬀerent apparent distortions of space-time in Special Relativity (see text).

Eqn.(5.5) describes the LFC eﬀect, while combining Eqns.(5.5) and (5.6) to eliminate
∆x yields the equation for the Complementary Eﬀect. By taking other projections the
other entries of Table 7 may be calculated in a similar fashion. It is interesting to note
that the TD eﬀect can be derived directly from the LFC eﬀect by using the symmetry of
the LT equations. Introducing the notation: s

ct, the LT may be written as:

(5.7)
(5.8)

(5.9)
(5.10)

Writing out the LFC entries in the ﬁrst row of Table 7, replacing t, t′ by s/c, s′/c ; gives

Applying T 1 to each entry in this row results in:

Applying T 2:

Replacing ∆s, ∆s′ by c∆t, c∆t′ yields the last row of Table 7 which describes the TD
eﬀect. Similarly TC can be derived from SD (or vice versa) by successively applying the
transformations T 1, T 2.

A remark on the ‘Observed Quantities’ in Table 7. For the LFC, SD the observed
quantity is a length interval in the frame S. The apparent space distortion occurs because
this length diﬀers from the result of of a similar measurement made on the same object in
its own rest frame. ∆x′ is not directly measured at the time of observation of the LFC or
5 Actually the transformation T 2 yields the inverse of the LT (5.7),(5.8). The inverse equations may

then be solved to recover (5.7) and (5.8)

SD. It is otherwise with the time measurements TD, TC. Here the time interval in their
own rest frame indicated by a moving clock (TD), or diﬀerent equivalent clocks at the
same position in S (TC), is supposed to be directly observed and compared with the time
interval ∆t registered by an unmoving clock in the observer’s rest frame. Thus the eﬀect
refers to two simultaneous observations by the same observer not to separate observations
by two diﬀerent observers as in the case of the LFC and SD.

Einstein’s great achievement in his ﬁrst paper on Special Relativity [1] was, for the
ﬁrst time, to clearly disentangle in Classical Electromagnetism, the purely geometrical
and kinematical eﬀects embodied in the Lorentz Transformation from dynamics. In spite
of this, papers still appear from time to time in the literature claiming that moving objects
‘really’ contract [6] or that moving clocks ‘really’ run slow [7] for dynamical reasons, or
even that such dynamical eﬀects are the true basis of Special Relativity and should be
taught as such [8]. As it has been shown above that a moving object can apparently
shrink or expand, and identical moving clocks can apparently run fast or slow, depending
only on how they are observed, it is clear that they cannot ‘really’ shrink, or run slow,
respectively. If a moving object actually shrinks for dynamical reasons it is hard to see
how the same object, viewed in a diﬀerent way (in fact only illuminated diﬀerently in
its own rest frame) can be seen to expand. Certainly both eﬀects cannot be dynamically
explained. In fact the Lorentz Transformation, as applied to space-time, describes only the
appearance of space-time events, a purely geometrical property. The apparent distortions
are of geometrical origin, the space-time analogues of the apparent distortions of objects
in space, described by the laws of perspective, when they are linearly projected into a two
dimensional sub-space by a camera or the human eye.

In conclusion the essential characteristics of the two ‘new’ space-time distortions dis-

cussed above are summarised :

•

Space Dilatation (SD): If a luminous object, lying along the Ox’ axis at rest in the
frame S’, has a short luminous lifetime in this frame, it will be observed from a
frame S, in uniform motion relative to S’ parallel to Ox’ at the velocity -βc, as a
narrow line, perpendicular to the x-axis, moving with the velocity c/β in the same
direction as the moving object. The total distance swept out along the x-axis by
the moving line during the time βl0/(c√1
β2), for which the moving line image
exists, is l0/√1
β2 where l0 is the length of the object as observed in S’. Thus the
apparent length of the object when viewed with a time resolution much larger than
βl0/(c√1

β2. Any eﬀects of LPTD are not taken into account.

Time Contraction (TC): The equivalent clocks in the moving frame S’, viewed at
the same position in the stationary frame S, apparently run faster by a factor
1/√1

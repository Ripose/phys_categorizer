The above ﬁgure represents the expected distribution of model random-walker
votes cast for each NCAA Division I-A football team in 2001 pre-bowl rank-
ings. The organization of the teams and the lines connecting them represent
the community structure hierarchy, of which the conferences are one level
of organization. The colors represent the expected percentage of votes cast
per team at each level in the hierarchy, from individual teams up through
inter-conference organization, the conferences, and the connections between
conferences. The biased probability for voting for the winners of games in the
data represented in this ﬁgure is p = 0.65. Details are in the enclosed article.

We develop a one-parameter family of ranking systems for NCAA
Division I-A football teams based on a collection of voters, each
with a single vote, executing independent random walks on a net-
work deﬁned by the teams (vertices) and the games played (edges).
The virtue of this class of ranking systems lies in the simplicity of
its explanation. We discuss the statistical properties of the ran-
domly walking voters and relate them to the community structure
of the underlying network. We compare the results of these rank-
ings for recent seasons with Bowl Championship Series standings
and component rankings. To better understand this ranking sys-
tem, we also examine the asymptotic behaviors of the aggregate
of walkers. Finally, we consider possible generalizations to this
ranking algorithm.

The Bowl Championship Series (BCS) agreement was created in 1998 in
an eﬀort to match the top two NCAA Division I-A teams in an end-of-season
National Championship game. The BCS system takes the champions from
the six major conferences—the Pac-10, Big 12, Big Ten, ACC, SEC and
Big East, plus Notre Dame—and two at-large teams to play in four BCS

bowls, with the National Championship game rotating among those bowls
on a yearly basis. The ranking system used to determine which teams play
in the championship games has signiﬁcant ﬁnancial ramiﬁcations, with the
Rose, Fiesta, Sugar and Orange bowls generating more than $100 million
a year for the six BCS conferences. There is also a general belief that the
schools playing in the National Championship game reap immediate increases
in ﬁnancial contributions and student applications.

Attempts to determine the “top two” teams also have enormous personal
ramiﬁcations for college football fans nationwide. The BCS attempts to
rank teams fairly in order to determine which two most deserve to play in
the National Championship game and which teams should play in the other
major bowl games. Before the BCS was instituted, teams were selected for
major bowl games according to tradition. For example, the Rose Bowl had
traditionally featured the conference champions from the Big 10 and Pac-
10. Consequently a match between the #1 and #2 teams in the nation
rarely occurred in bowl games. This often left multiple undefeated teams
and many co-National Champions. On other occasions, a single team with
an arguably easy schedule might be undefeated and therefore be declared
National Champion by polls without ever having played a “major” opponent
(e.g., BYU in 1984).

The BCS system attempts to address this problem and simultaneously
maintain the tradition of ﬁnishing the season with bowl games. It consists
of a combination of four equal factors: two polls (coaches and sportswriters),
algorithmic rankings, strength of schedule, and losses. Bonus points are
also awarded for defeating highly-ranked teams. Seven sources currently
provide the participating ranking algorithms, selected by the BCS from over
50 applicants. The best and worst computer rankings are removed and the
remaining ﬁve are averaged.

The fundamental diﬃculty in accurately ranking or even agreeing on a
ranking algorithm for the NCAA Division I-A college football teams lies in
two factors—the dearth of games played by each team and the large dispar-
ities in the type and diﬃculty of the schedules of individual teams. With
more than 110 Division I-A football teams, the 10–13 regular season games
(including conference tournaments) played by each team severely limits the
quantity of information relative to, for example, college and professional bas-
ketball and baseball schedules. Even the 32 teams in the professional Na-
tional Football League (NFL) each play 16 regular season games against 13
distinct opponents, including multiple games against divisional opponents.

2

The NFL then uses the regular season outcomes to seed a 12-team playoﬀ.
Moreover, most of the Division I-A football teams play the majority of their
games within their conferences, with signiﬁcant variations in the level of play
from one conference to another further complicating attempts to select the
“top two” teams from the available information. To make matters worse, it
is not even clear what the “top two” teams should mean: Should these teams
be the two who had the best season overall or the two playing the best at
the end of the season?

Despite the obvious diﬃculties in determining a “best” algorithm, many
diﬀerent systems for ranking college football teams have been promoted by
mathematically and statistically inclined fans. A subset of them comprise
one component of the oﬃcial BCS standings. Many of these schemes (see, for
example, [1]) are relatively complicated mathematically, making it virtually
impossible for the lay sports enthusiast to understand the ranking method-
ology and the assumptions made therein. Worse still, the essential formulas
of many of the algorithms currently employed by the BCS are not even pub-
lically declared. This state of aﬀairs has inspired the creation of software to
develop one’s own rankings using a collection of polls and algorithms [2] and
comical commentary on “faking” one’s own mathematical algorithm [3].

Because of the essential diﬃculties and controversies involved, we sought
to investigate whether a simply-explained algorithm constructed by crudely
mimicking the behavior of a collection of voters could provide reasonable
rankings. We deﬁne a collection of voting automatons (random walkers) who
can each cast a single vote for the team they believe is the best. Because
the most natural arguments relating the relative rankings of two teams come
from the outcome of head-to-head competition, each of these voters routinely
examines the outcome of a single game played by their favorite team, selected
at random from that team’s schedule, and makes a new determination of
which team to vote for based on the outcome of that game, preferring but
not absolutely certain to go with the winner. In the simplest deﬁnition of this
process, the probability p of choosing the winner is deﬁned to be the same
for all voters and games played, with p > 1/2 because on average the winner
should be the better team and p < 1 to allow one of these artiﬁcial voters
to argue that the losing team is still the better team.
(Additionally, the
p = 1 limit can be mathematically more complicated in certain scenarios, as
is addressed below.) That is, if the voter’s preferred team won the examined
game, the walker’s vote remains with that team with probability p; however,
if that team lost the game, then with probability p the walker changes its

3

vote to the winning opponent. Conversely, a given walker will vote for the
losing team with probability 0 < (1 −p) < 1/2, corresponding to any number
of reasons one might rationalize that the losing team is still the better team.
The behavior of each synthetic voter is driven by a simpliﬁed version of the
“but my team beat your team” arguments that one commonly hears about
why one team should be ranked higher than another. For instance, much
of the 2001 BCS controversy centered on the fact that BCS #2 Nebraska
had lost to BCS #3 Colorado, and the 2000 BCS controversy was driven by
BCS #4 Washington’s defeat of BCS #3 Miami and Miami’s win over BCS
#2 Florida State. While developing a reasonable ranking is an incredibly
diﬃcult task because of the relatively few games between many teams, most
fans would agree that team A winning a game against team B more often
means that team A should be the better team (thus p > 1/2). Despite that,
various arguments are always made about why a losing team may still have
been the better team, for instance due to weather, oﬃciating, injuries, or
sheer luck (thus p < 1).

The voting automatons thus act as independent random walkers on a
graph (“network”) deﬁned with biased edges (“connections”) between teams
that played games head-to-head. This algorithm is easy to deﬁne in terms
of the “microscopic” behavior of individual voting walkers who randomly
change their votes based on the won-loss outcomes of individual games. The
random behavior of these individual voters is, of course, grossly simplistic.
Indeed, under the speciﬁed range of p, a given voter will never reach a certain
conclusion about which team is the best; rather, it will forever change its
allegiance from one team to another, ultimately traversing the entire graph
and thus eventually casting a vote for every single team. In practice, however,
the “macroscopic” total number of votes cast for each team by an aggregate
of random-walking voters quickly reaches a statistically-steady ranking of the
top teams according to the quality of their seasons.

We do not claim that this random-walker ranking algorithm is superior
to other algorithms, nor do we review the vast number of ranking systems
available, as numerous such reviews are available (see, for example, [1] for
a large listing of various schemes, [4, 5, 6] for reviews of diﬀerent ranking
methodologies, and the “Bibliography on College Football Ranking Systems”
maintained at [7]). Rather, our intention is to determine whether such a sim-
ply deﬁned random-walker ranking yields reasonable results. We do not even
claim that this ranking algorithm is wholly novel; indeed, the resulting linear
algebra problem is related to the “direct methods” discussed and referenced

4

by Keener [4].

Nevertheless, we propose this model on the strength of its simple interpre-
tation of random-walking voters as a reasonable way to rank the top teams
(or at least as reasonable as other available methods, given the scarcity of
games played relative to the numbers of teams). In contrast, the deﬁnitions
of many ranking algorithms are more mathematically intensive, and some
systems include a miasma of seemingly arbitrary parameters whose eﬀects
are diﬃcult to understand and interpret. Some systems are even tweaked
periodically in an attempt to yield the purportedly “most reasonable” rank-
ing based on recent results. The advantage of the algorithm discussed here
and its random-walking voter interpretation is that it has only one explicit,
precisely-deﬁned parameter with a meaningful interpretation that is easily
understood at the level of single-voter behavior.

This article is organized as follows: The mathematical details of the rank-
ing algorithm and statistical properties of the independent random walkers
are presented in the next section. We then discuss some of the network prop-
erties of the graph deﬁned by the games played, independent of the outcomes
of those games, with special attention to community structure. We brieﬂy
compare historical outcomes from this algorithm with other ranking systems
and polls. We also investigate the asymptotic behavior of the random walkers
for extreme values of the probability p. Finally, we discuss various possible
generalizations of this ranking methodology.

1 Ranking with Random Walkers

Given the outcomes of the games played, we denote for each i the number
of games played ni, wins wi, and losses li by team i. A tie (possible prior
to the current NCAA overtime format) is treated as half a win and half a
loss, so that ni = wi + li holds. The number of random walkers casting their
single vote for team i is vi, with the condition that the total number of voters
remains constant,

i vi = Q.

P

If team i beat team j, then the average rate at which a walker voting
for team j changes allegiances to vote for team i is proportional to p, while
the rate at which a walker already voting for team i switches to team j is
propotional to (1 − p). We additionally need to deﬁne the rate at which
individual walkers currently voting for team i consider the diﬀerent ni games
played by that team. For simplicity, we assume that each of the ni games is

5

selected with equal weight (which will have consequences for the 2001 season,
as will be discussed below). To avoid rewarding teams for the raw numbers of
games played, we set the total rate at which games are considered by voters
at the ith vertex to be proportional to the number ni of edges coming out of
that vertex.

The expected rate of change of the number of votes cast for each team
in this random walk is thus quantiﬁed by a homogeneous system of linear
diﬀerential equations,

¯v′ = D · ¯v ,

(1)

where ¯v is the T -vector of the expected number ¯vi of votes cast for each of
the T teams, and D is the square matrix given by

Dii = −pli − (1 − p)wi ,

1
2

Nij +

Dij =

(2p − 1)
2
where Nij is the number of head-to-head games played between teams i and
j and Aij is the number of wins of team i over team j minus the number of
losses in those Nij games. That is, if i and j played at most one head-to-head
game, then

i 6= j ,

Aij ,

(2)

Aij = +1 ,
Aij = −1 ,
Aij = 0 ,

if team i beat team j ,
if team i lost to team j ,

if team i tied or did not play team j .

(3)

In the event that two teams play each other multiple times (which occasion-
ally occurs because of conference championship tournaments), we sum Aij
over each game, as mentioned above. We again remark that the probability
p of going with the winner is constrained to lie in the interval (1/2 , 1), so
that the winning team is rewarded for winning but that some uncertainty
in voter behavior is maintained. The oﬀ-diagonal elements Dij are therefore
necessarily nonnegative and vanish if and only if teams i and j did not play
directly against one another.

The matrix D encompasses all of the connections and won-loss outcomes

between teams. The steady-state equilibrium

D · ¯v∗ = 0

(4)

of (1,2) gives the expected populations ¯v∗ of the random walkers for each
team. The critical point ¯v∗ lies in the null-space of D—that is, it is the

6

eigenvector associated with a zero eigenvalue. It is important to realize that
the appropriate equations to solve are not those indicating that each indi-
vidual connection has zero ﬂow at equilibrium. To illustrate this, consider a
schedule of three teams in which each plays only two games such that i beats
j, j beats k, and k beats j. In this cyclic situation, the votes ﬂow on average
around the triangle (no detailed balance), but a statistical equilibrium occurs
when each team receives the same number of votes.

Recall that the ranking system presented here examines the NCAA Di-
vision I-A football teams. As many of these teams play Non-Division I-A
teams, we have added an additional vertex to the graph representing all the
Non-Division-I-A teams that play against Division I-A opponents. Because
these teams usually do not fare well against Division I-A competition, this
new “team” ends up ranked very low, and does not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the
random walker populations except to penalize losses against Non-Division-
I-A teams and to maintain the constraint that the total number of votes Q
remains constant (i.e., votes do not leave the graph). Alternatively, one could
elect to ignore games against Non-Division-I-A opponents, but one may pre-
fer to recognize losses against such opponents as serious demerits in ranking
teams. The ideal situation would be to study the connected component of
all football games that includes all of Division I-A as a subgraph; but we
do not consider this here because it was easier to obtain data (from [8]) and
investigate the algorithm on the smaller graph consisting only of Division I-A
football teams and a single node collectively representing the Non-Division
I-A teams.

Given the schedule and won-loss outcomes, the long-time statistical be-
havior of these randomly walking voters is determined by the single parameter
p, the probability of a random walker choosing the winner of a given game.
These votes can be used directly to rank the teams. Despite the simplistic
behavior of an individual random walker, the behavior of an aggregate of
voters (or equivalently, because of the independence assumption, the long-
time average of a single voter) seems to yield reasonably robust orderings of
the top teams. It is not surprising that the detailed results describing the
number of votes cast for a given team vary substantially for diﬀerent values
of p; nevertheless, the relative ranking of the top few teams does not vary
much for diﬀerent p, as indicated for the 2001 and 2002 seasons in Figure 1.
While we investigated college football rankings going back to 1970; we focus
much of our discussion here on 2001 and 2002, since these seasons represent
two extreme situations in attempting to rank college football teams.

The only certainty in the 2001 pre-bowl game rankings [9] was that Miami
belonged in the National Championship game as the only undefeated team
in Division I-A football. Indeed, both polls and all eight algorithms used by
the BCS picked Miami as the #1 team going into the bowl games at the end
of the 2001 season. The controversy commonly presented outside the Paciﬁc
Northwest in December 2001 concerned Nebraska’s selection as the #2 BCS
team, narrowly surpassing BCS #3 Colorado despite the latter’s late-season
rout of Nebraska, with smaller mention of the fact that BCS #4 Oregon had
been ranked #2 in both polls. After the bowl games, in which Miami defeated
Nebraska and Oregon defeated Colorado, it was Oregon’s absence from the
Championship game that became the centerpiece of national controversy.
The random walkers select Oregon #2 for p > 1/2 up to p ≈ .62, above which
Nebraska takes #2 in a narrow range up to p ≈ .68. Above that value, the
random walkers select Tennessee as #2. The entire controversy that season
would have been avoided had Tennessee not lost the SEC Championship game
to LSU at the end of the season. Without any intention of being deliberately
non-conformist [3] or regionally biased, the random walking voters (Figure
1a) choose Tennessee as #2 over the widest range of probabilities (in contrast,
Tennessee fell to #5 in the BCS and #8 in both polls following their loss
to LSU). This ranking is partially explained by the fact that the simplest
random-walking voter algorithm presented here does not distinguish games
based on the date played. When we revisit this situation below, we will also
see that the SEC as a whole is highly ranked that season; indeed, in the
p → 1 limit, Florida is ranked #3 and LSU is ranked #4 (neither shown
in the Figure), with Oregon falling to #5 and both Nebraska and Colorado
falling completely out of the top 10. At smaller values of p (closer to 1/2)
Florida falls to #8, and LSU is not even in the top 10 for p . 0.77.

In contrast, the BCS system worked virtually without controversy in se-
lecting teams for the National Championship game at the end of the 2002
season [10], as there were precisely two undefeated teams, both from major
conferences, and no other obvious top contenders. Both polls picked Mi-
ami and Ohio State as the top two teams, in agreement with almost all of
the seven ranking algorithms used that year (with some changes from the
previous year because of just-instituted BCS rules forbidding margin of vic-
tory from contributing to the algorithms). The only nonconformist was the
New York Times ranking system, which picked Miami and USC as the top
two teams—the latter presumably in part due to its diﬃcult schedule. For
p ≈ 1/2, the random walkers also put USC in the top two based on the

most values of p that the top two teams are Miami and Ohio State.

The diﬀerences between the 2001 and 2002 pre-bowl results can be fur-
ther explored by exploiting the statistical properties of expected vote totals
to express a measure of conﬁdence in the resulting rankings. An important
property of these random walkers is that the matrix D gives a single attract-
ing equilibrium ¯v∗ for a given p, provided the underlying graph representing
games played between teams consists of a single connected component. We
can see this in three steps:

• The column sums of D vanish because the sum of the populations re-
j Dijvj (that is, the dynamics

with ¯vj = 0 necessarily have growing populations. In other words, all
average ﬂows go “into” the hyperquadrant in which ¯vj > 0 for all j.

• Finally, because (1) is linear, the only possibility is that there is a single

attracting sink, ¯v∗, in the hyperplane.

The above argument breaks down when the graph is not connected, as one
can then have a disconnected subgraph with zero voter population that re-
mains zero. Alternatively, one can recast this matrix equation in terms of an
eigenvalue problem and apply the Perron-Frobenius theorem as described in
[4]; however, given the speciﬁc random-walker interpretation built into the
rate matrices here, the above arguments already ensure that the expected
populations achieve a uniquely determined attracting state, provided that
the graph is a single connected component. In the absence of such connected-
ness, the Perron-Frobenius theorem cannot be applied because the resulting
matrices are no longer irreducible.

i (1 − ¯v∗

i /Q and ¯v∗

i /Q, with mean ¯v∗

Any initial voter distribution eventually randomizes completely, and the
steady-state distribution of the number of votes vi cast for the ith team is
therefore binomial (for Q trials) with probability ¯v∗
i and
variance ¯v∗
i /Q). The joint probability density function of two vertices
is not perfectly independent, as the sum over all vertices equals the number
of random walkers Q. However, it is nevertheless obtained from distributing
Q random trials across two vertices, with probabilities ¯v∗
j /Q, so
it is joint binomial. We can exploit this fact to measure conﬁdence in the
relative ranking of two teams in terms of the minimum number of voters Qmin
required to ensure that the expected diﬀerence between the number of votes
cast for each team is larger than the standard deviation of that diﬀerence.
This Qmin required to successfully distinguish between rank-ordered pairs
of teams is plotted for the 2001 and 2002 pre-bowl rankings in Figure 2.
In particular, we note that—as expected from the above discussions—the
relative numbers of voters required to successfully distinguish #1 from #2 in
2001 and #2 from #3 in 2002 are signiﬁcantly smaller (have a higher degree
of certainty) than, in particular, the distinction between #2 and #3 in 2001.
Because the statistical properties of the random walking voters follow
directly from the linear algebra problem (1,2,4), there is no need to simulate
independent random walkers to obtain the actual rankings. This simplicity
disappears if interactions between random walkers are included, as will be
considered brieﬂy at the end of this article.

between the teams that season (edges). Each season consists of 650–750
games between approximately 115 teams.
In every season since 1990, the
graph becomes a single connected component by the third or fourth week of
the season (not counting faux connections via the single “Non Division I-A”
node that is inserted into the ranking system in order to include games played
against Non Division I-A opponents). The relative quickness in achieving a
single connected component (after only about 200 games have been played) is
due in part to schools typically playing many of their non-conference games
at the beginning of the season.

The degree of each vertex (that is, the number of games played by each
team) varies in a narrow range, depending on the point in the season ana-
lyzed, with between 10 and 13 connections each in the graph prior to the bowl
games and between 10 and 14 connections for the post-bowl games graph.
The diameter of the graph, deﬁned as the maximal number of edges needed
to travel from one vertex to another (that is, the longest geodesic path), was
4 in every post-bowl graph since 1970. We also calculated the local clustering
coeﬃcient (Ci) for the ith team (teami) in the network, given by [11, 12]

Ci =

number of triangles connected to vertex i
number of triples centered on vertex i

.

In particular, it is important to note the strong heterogeneity of this network.

Table 1: Means and standard deviations of local clustering coeﬃcients of the
teams in each Division I-A conference.

Each conference typically has diﬀerent average local clustering coeﬃcients
that also diﬀer signiﬁcantly from the coeﬃcients for independent teams such
as Notre Dame (see Table 1).

A number of other network properties [12] can be calculated (including
average path lengths, most central teams, and most connected teams), but
such computations do not necessarily help explain the random-walker statis-
tics. An important exception is the community structure [13] of the graph,
which is useful for understanding the nature of the conference scheduling and
the resulting eﬀect on the random-walker statistics. Community structure
relies on the notion of betweenness, which measures the number of geodesics
on a graph that traverse a given subcomponent (such as a node or an edge)
of the graph. In particular, the edge betweenness of an edge is deﬁned as
the number of geodesics that traverse it. The algorithm for computing this
community structure is given in [13]. Brieﬂy, the edge with the highest be-
tweenness is removed from the graph, and the betweenness is recalculated for
the resulting graph before another edge is removed. This process is subse-
quently repeated until no edges remain. The removal of some of these edges
breaks a single graph component into two parts, thereby yielding information
that is used to group the network into a heirarchy of communities. Girvan &
Newman [13] demonstrated that their community structure algorithm closely
reproduced the pre-deﬁned conference structure of the 2000 football season;

12

we found similar results for other years.

Using the 2001 schedule as an example, Figure 3a portrays the col-
lege football conference structure (“community structure”). As was already
demonstrated in [13] for the 2000 Division I-A schedule, the conferences and
even their subdivisions are reasonably constructed based on their relative
strength of community. One can even interpret qualitatively the relative
closeness of diﬀerent conferences and of the independent teams. Observe,
for example, the close connections between Notre Dame, Navy, and the Big
East.

This community structure is intimately linked to the dynamics of the
random-walking voters, because the speciﬁc pairings of the interconference
games and the outcomes of those games strongly inﬂuence the percentage of
time that the voters spend inside given conferences or more general struc-
tures such as the divisions inside large conferences or larger groups of nearby
conferences. The 2001 pre-bowl community structure in Figure 3a is color-
coded according to the average percentage of voters per team (for p = 0.7)
at each level of the hierarchy of communities. Such a plot demonstrates the
relatively high average vote counts given here to the SEC, Pac-10, and Big
12, in contrast to the signiﬁcantly lower average number of votes per team
in the Big East despite Miami’s ﬁrst-place standing in this ranking.

We further quantiﬁed the importance of the relationships between confer-
ences by directly measuring the eﬀect of reversing the outcomes of individual
games. Keeping the games in the order in which their respective edges were
removed in developing the community structure, we measure the diﬀerence
between the original voter populations and the new populations calculated
with the won-loss outcome of that single game reversed. Because the dom-
inant eﬀect of such reversals is to change the rankings of the two teams
involved in that game, we calculate the change to the global distribution of
i |2, where the edge removed corresponds to a
votes by the quantity
game between teams j and k. Plotting this quantity versus the order of the
edge removed, we observe a sharp transition in average magnitude between
the ﬁrst approximately 200 edges and those that follow. This corresponds
roughly to the number of edges removed in the community structure deter-
mination at which the hierarchy breaks up into diﬀerent conferences. That
is, these ﬁrst couple hundred edges in the community structure determina-
tion are predominantly non-conference games, while those that follow are
intraconference.

the Pac-10 and Big 12 is quantiﬁed by the average conference votes per team
plotted in Figure 4a. This presumably results from a number of interconfer-
ence games won by SEC teams that year. Only in the p → 1 limit of this plot
does the Big East dominate, because every random walker votes for Miami
in this limit. As with almost every other measurement here, the 2002 results
are completely dominated by the undefeated pair of Miami and Ohio State,
with most of the votes going to their respective conferences (Big East and
Big 10) in Figure 4b.

3 Asymptotics at Large and Small p

For a given probability p, the expected populations that go with the winner
depend in a complex manner on the details of game schedules and outcomes.
In an attempt to better understand the eﬀects of selecting a given value of p,
it is instructive to analytically investigate the limiting behaviors near p = 1/2
and p = 1. We demonstrate, in particular, that the main contributions near
p = 1/2 include a measurement of strength of schedule, whereas values near
p = 1 are dominated by undefeated teams.

It is worth noting that this ranking system inherently rewards teams both

for good won-loss records and for playing diﬃcult schedules, as do essentially
all good ranking schemes, whether determined via an algorithm or a poll. One
might thus question whether it makes sense for the BCS system to continue
to explicitly add additional contributions for strength of schedule and for
number of losses, each currently making up 25% of the BCS formula. One
should also keep in mind that in order to reward a team for playing a diﬃcult
schedule, one is inherently penalizing—explicitly or implicitly—other teams
for playing weaker opponents even when they win those games.

On Any Given Saturday. Consider p = 1/2 + ε, ε ≪ 1. The rate matrix
can be rewritten in the form

Dij =

∆ij + ε ˜Dij ,

where ∆ is the graph Laplacian, with ∆ij = 1 for i 6= j if nodes i and j
are connected (the two teams played each other) and the ith element on the
diagonal is equal to the negative of the degree of vertex i. The matrix ˜D
is then the same as the A matrix oﬀ the diagonal, with the values wi − li
on the diagonal. The steady-state expected probability at each site, ¯v∗
j =

That is, the ﬁrst correction ¯v(1)
at p close to 1/2 is the potential that solves
a discrete Poisson equation (subject to the
j = 0 constraint) with
charge proportional to the won-loss record of each team. It thus incorporates
the record of the jth team and is also heavily inﬂuenced by the records
of the nearest neighbors and other close teams in the graph. That is, the
ﬁrst correction ¯v(1)
is strongly inﬂuenced by a ‘strength of schedule’ notion
(though this is not the precise strength of schedule used in the BCS), as
evidenced by USC’s high 2002 pre-bowl ranking at small p. Finally, it is only
with the second-order term ¯v(2)
that information pertaining to speciﬁc games
a given team won and lost begins to be incorporated, as ¯v(1)
considers only
net records.

It is insightful to compare this ‘strength of schedule’ dominance near
p = 1/2 with those obtained from randomly-generated round-robin results.
If T teams each play T −1 games, one against each of the available opponents,
then the graph Laplacian is the matrix of 1’s oﬀ the diagonal and −(T −1) on
the diagonal. Hence, this strength of schedule contribution is also determined
completely from a given team’s won-loss record. The expected populations
of the team vertices for round-robins at p = 1/2 + ε are therefore linear in p,
ordered strictly according to won-loss records.

Winner Takes All. The asymptotic behavior when p = 1 − ε is more
complicated because the p = 1 limiting state depends on the number of un-
defeated teams and the details of their schedules. For instance, it is not
surprising that the 2001 pre-bowl rankings (Figure 1a) gives all walkers vot-
ing for Miami in the p → 1 limit, since Miami is the single undefeated team.
In contrast, the 2002 pre-bowl rankings (Figure 1b) only marginally sepa-
rates the two undefeated teams, Miami and Ohio State, in the p → 1 limit.
Miami received roughly 52% of the votes in the limit and Ohio State got the
remainder.

While numerically exploring this limit, we found a number of interesting

16

cases, including two extreme ﬁnal post-bowl-game random walker rankings
using data from the 1971 and 1973 seasons.
In 1971, both Nebraska and
Toledo went undefeated and untied, but Nebraska (the 1971 Champion in
both the AP and UPI polls) receives more than 95% of the votes in the
p → 1 limit, because of its stronger schedule. As an aside, it should of
course be recognized that Toledo’s 1973 season is far from the only historical
instance of a team going undefeated on a relatively easy schedule, and any
algorithmic or opinionated ranking system will have a diﬃcult time ﬁguring
out precisely how to rank such squads. In 1973, three teams went undefeated
and untied and another three teams went undefeated with one tie each. In
the p → 1 limit, ﬁve of these teams maintain positive populations of random
walkers, because two of the teams with ties, Michigan and Ohio State, got
their tie in a game played against each other. With the edge between these
two teams equally carrying votes back and forth, Michigan and Ohio State
tie for second place in the p → 1 limit, behind Notre Dame’s undefeated and
untied squad (#1 AP, #4 UPI) but ahead of two undefeated teams with no
ties.

j + ε¯v(1)

ij − ε ˜Dij and ¯vj = ¯v(0)

The simplest situation to consider asymptotically occurs when a single
undefeated team garners all random walker votes for p = 1 − ε as ε → 0. The
transition rates are then written Dij = D(0)
j +
O(ε2). Here, D(0) is equal to (N + A)/2 oﬀ the diagonal and the negation of
the number of losses absorbed by each team on the diagonal (remembering
that a tie counts as half a win and half a loss), while ˜D remains as deﬁned
above. The limiting state ¯v(0)
j = Qδju equals unity for the single undefeated
team (“u”) and zero otherwise. If there is only one undefeated team with no
ties, then this is the single linearly-independent null-vector of D(0), except
for the unlikely but possible scenarios in which two one-loss (tie) teams lost
(tied) each other (recalling again the 1973 ﬁnal rankings). Even with this
simplifying assumption, the ﬁrst-order perturbative analysis requires one to
solve the linear algebra problem, D(0) · ¯v(1) = b, with bj = Q ˜Dju, which
neither simpliﬁes nor oﬀers any intuition beyond the original rate equations
(1,2,4).

4 Possible Extensions

A number of generalizations of the above ranking algorithm are possible,
ranging from trivial redeﬁnitions of the rate matrix D to fundamental shifts

17

in the mathematical tools required to investigate the random-walking vot-
ers. A complete description of the probability distributions of the random
walkers given above in terms of a single linear algebra problem relies on the
independence of the dynamics (vote changes) of the individual voters. Gen-
eralizations that violate this independence can drastically change the facility
of solution.

The simplest generalizations of the random walker rankings are those that
modify the rate matrix D without changing the independence of the random
walkers themselves. For instance, margin of victory, home-ﬁeld advantage,
and the date of the game can easily be incorporated into the deﬁnition of
D by replacing the constant probability p of going with the winner with a
function that includes these components. The resulting transition rates of
walking each direction on a single edge continue to be deﬁned by the outcome
of the game represented by that edge, and the linear algebra problem follows
as above.

For instance, it would be natural to make the probability of going to-
wards the winner along a given edge higher for a larger margin of victory
or for a game won on the road. However, turning this qualitative assertion
into a quantitative ranking requires adding more parameters to the ranking
algorithm, in stark contrast to the simplifying philosophy considered here.
Adding such variables would require at least some discussion about what
“good” values of those parameters might be, and tweaking any of these pa-
rameters would of course change the resulting rankings. Moreover, starting
with 2002 the BCS only uses ranking algorithms that do not include margin
of victory, to avoid rewarding unsportsmanlike running-up of the score. Fi-
nally, whether or not one wishes to include date of game rests on whether one
believes that the National Championship game should be played between the
two teams who had the best seasons or the two teams who are playing the
best at the end of the season (again, compare this with the favorable way that
the random walkers rank Tennessee in 2001). There are thus good reasons
to prefer the simpler system with a single probability p, as presented in the
sections above, and we have therefore not further explored generalizations
that add additional parameters.

A generalization that makes the resulting calculations only slightly more
diﬃcult is to give each random walker two votes instead of only one. This
change is particularly sensible if the point is to select the two teams to play
head-to-head in a National Championship game. We considered such rank-
ings generated from random walkers who each hold two equal votes (as op-

18

posed to a #1 vote and a separate #2 vote), using the same probability pa-
rameter p of selecting the winner along each edge, subject to the additional
constraint that a given voter must cast their two votes for two diﬀerent teams.
This two-vote constrained random walk is most easily understood in terms
of independent random walks on the signiﬁcantly larger network in which
each vertex represents a possible pair of votes and the edges between vertices
include games played between teams representing one of the two votes, with
the other vote held ﬁxed. This again immediately reduces to a linear algebra
problem for the expected percentage of votes garnered by each team, albeit
of much higher rank (T [T − 1]/2 for T teams). Clearly, further increases in
the number of votes held by each random walker would quickly make the
state space so large that the linear algebra solve is no longer feasible.

The expected vote percentages for the 2001 pre-bowl ranking with two
votes per walker are presented in Figure 5a. Comparing with the single-
vote case, Figure 1a, Miami of course can only obtain half the votes in the
p → 1 limit here because of the constraint that each walker casts the two
votes for two diﬀerent teams, leaving 50% of the votes available to select a
#2 team. Interestingly, Tennessee does not do quite as well here relative to
the other 2nd-place contenders (especially Oregon) as in the single vote case.
The reasons for this shift remain unclear but presumably could be related to
Tennessee’s relatively close distance to Miami (one common opponent, both
teams having defeated Syracuse that season, whereas Oregon is farther away
from both Miami and Tennessee in the graph). Another likely possibility is
that the constraint that each voter casts two votes for two diﬀerent teams
creates an eﬀective pressure that reduces the numbers of votes cast for the
closely-connected top-ranked teams of the SEC (Tennessee, Florida, LSU).
Nevertheless, Tennessee maintains the 2nd place spot at most values of p.

Unsurprisingly, the 2002 two-vote rankings (not shown) are very similar
to the single-vote values, with Miami and Ohio State splitting the votes in
the p → 1 limit.

One can also consider generalizations that destroy the independence of
individual random walkers. One possibility is to consider voters that are
inﬂuenced in their decisions by the number of other walkers voting for each
team in a head-to-head game. Whether they are inclined to follow the crowd
or to try to be non-conformist, such dependence between the random walkers
makes the mean-ﬁeld calculation nonlinear and removes most of our knowl-
edge of the probability distributions about the mean percentages of votes
per team. Another such generalization is to more strongly weight the eﬀects

of ‘upsets’ by increasing the ﬂow of votes towards a lower-ranked team that
beats a team with larger number of votes. Of course, this ﬂow increase might
reverse the ordering of the two teams, thereby removing the ‘upset’ charac-
ter and reducing the ﬂow towards the winning team of that game, so there
may not even be a statistically-steady ordering of the two teams. A similar
complication occurs if one breaks the independence of the walkers by adding
a ‘bonus’ for beating a team ranked in (for example) the top 10 in the form
of reducing the probability of voting for the loser below (1 − p). This reduced
ﬂow towards the losing team can knock them out of the top 10, thereby caus-
ing the bonus to disappear so that the losing team rises back into the top
10 again. Obviously, the study of any of these interacting random walkers is
signiﬁcantly more diﬃcult than the independent walkers discussed above.

Finally, we should close with at least some discussion about what values
of the probability p yield “good” rankings. Perhaps neither the dominance
of strength of schedule near p = 1/2 (for example, USC in 2001) nor the
emphasis on undefeated seasons near p = 1 (for example, BYU in 1984)
are appropriate. Rather, one might argue that a more “balanced” value of
p may be more appropriate, perhaps at or around p = 0.75 (linearly split
between the two extremes) or perhaps near p = 0.8 (shifted slightly towards
larger p values because the asymptotic strength of schedule dominance near
p = 1/2 appears to extend further than the sharper changes close to p = 1).
We consider brieﬂy whether there is an optimal p. For instance, Figure 5b

20

shows the organization of the win/loss outcome of every game in the 2001
pre-bowl schedule according to the random walker populations with p = 0.8.
The votes are not strictly ordered according to the winner and loser of each
individual game, but the winners do of course have more votes on average.
A possible optimization procedure is to select p to maximize the quality of
this ordering. This optimal p might vary from year to year.
It may be
worth investigating whether such optimization would connect this class of
“direct methods” [4] to the more statistically sophisticated maximum likeli-
hood “paired comparisons” originally introduced by Zermelo [14]. Of course,
the fact that diﬀerent values of p can give diﬀerent orderings of the teams
only underscores yet again the inherent diﬃculty in obtaining uncontrover-
sial rankings because of the relatively few numbers of games played between
the large number of NCAA Division I-A football teams.

5 Summary

In this article, we developed a simply-deﬁned ranking algorithm in which
random walkers individually and independently change their votes between
two teams that meet head-to-head, with a single explicit parameter describ-
ing the preference towards selecting the winner. We applied this algorithm to
the past 33 years of NCAA Division I-A college football, primarily discussing
the 2001 and 2002 seasons here. We explored the relationship between the
resulting rankings and the underlying network of games played by Division
I-A teams. We investigated the asymptotic behavior of this ranking system
in the two extremes of the probability parameter. We also considered pos-
sible generalizations of this ranking scheme—including the incorporation of
additional game factors and models with multiple votes per walker—and dis-
cussed complications due to interactions between the random-walking voters.

Interdisciplinary Monte Carlo Simulations

D. Stauﬀer

Institute for Theoretical Physics, Cologne University, D-50923 Euroland

Biological,

linguistic, sociological and economical applications of statistical
physics are reviewed here. They have been made on a variety of computers over
a dozen years, not only at the NIC computers. A longer description can be found
in [1], an emphasis on teaching in [2].

1 Introduction

The Monte Carlo methods invented for physics problems half a century ago
were later also applied to ﬁelds outside of physics, like economy [3], biol-
ogy [4], or sociology [5]. Instead of atoms one simulates animals, including
people. These physics methods are often called “independent agents” when
applied outside physics, to distinguish them from “representative agent” ap-
proximations and other mean ﬁeld theories. “Emergence” in these ﬁelds is
what physicists call self-organization, that means systems of many simple
particles showing complex behaviour (like freezing or evaporating) which is
not evident from the single-particle properties.

The three people cited in Refs.3-5 were not physicists; two got the eco-
nomics Nobel prize. But also physicists have entered these ﬁelds intensively
in the last years (and much earlier for biology; see Erwin Schr¨odinger’s ques-
tion: What is life?). The German Physical Society has since several years
a working group on socio-economic problems, started by Frank Schweitzer.
And our university just got approved a new Special Research Grant (SFB)
where geneticists and theoretical physicists are supposed to work together.
The NIC Research Group in J¨ulich is an earlier physics-biology example.

An important diﬀerence between physics and applications outside physics
is the thermodynamic limit. A glass of Cologne beer has about 1025 water
molecules, which is close enough to inﬁnity for physicists. Economists, in
contrast, are less interested in stock markets with 1025 traders. Thus ﬁnite-
size eﬀects, which often are a nuisance in Statistical Physics simulations, may
be just what we need outside of physics.

2 Population Genetics

Darwinian Evolution is similar to thermal physics in that two eﬀects compete:
Mother Nature wants to select the ﬁttest and to minimize energy; but more
or less random accidents (mutations in biology, thermal noise or entropy

in statistical physics) lead to deviations from ideality, like biological ageing
or minimization of the free energy. The following example is ongoing work
together with Cebrat, P¸ekalski, Moss de Oliveira and de Oliveira and can be
regarded as an improved Eigen quasispecies model.

Each individual in the population has a genome, which consists of two
bit-strings inherited from the mother and the father, respectively. Each bit-
string has L bits with L = 8, 16, 32, 64, as is convenient for Fortran words
(byte to integer*8). A bit set to one means a bad mutation in the DNA, while
a zero bit is a healthy gene. All mutations are assumed to be recessive, that
means they diminish the survival probability by a factor x < 1 if and only if
both the paternal and the maternal bit-string have their corresponding bits
mutated. At reproduction, the bit-strings in both the father and the mother
are mutated with probability M at a randomly selected position; then with
probability R they undergo a crossover (recombination) at some randomly
selected position (like in genetic algorithms); then the bits neighbouring the

3

crossover point are mutated with probability MR; and ﬁnally one bit-string of
the mother and one of the father give one child genome, with B such births
per iteration and per female. (The mother selects the father at random.)
Mutation attempts for an already mutated bit leave this bit unchanged.

At each iteration the genetic survival probability is xn where n is the
number of active mutations (bit-pairs set to 1) and x an input parameter.
To account for limitations in space and food, as well as for infections from
other individuals, additional Verhulst death probabilities proportional to the
current number of individuals are applied to both the newborns and at each
iteration to the adults.

For very small x, only mutation-free individuals survive: n = 0. With
growing x the survival chances grow, but so does the mutation load < n >
which in turn reduces the survival chances. As a result, for L = 64 three
diﬀerent phase transitions can be found in Fig.1: For 0 < x < 0.45 the
population dies out; for 0.45 < x < 0.96 it survives; for 0.96 < x < 0.98
it dies out again, and for 0.98 < x < 1 it survives again. The transitions
at 0.45 and 0.96 seem to be ﬁrst-order (jump in population and load) while
the one at 0.98 is second-order (continuous). For x > 0.98 all bits of both
bit-strings are mutated to one, which allows a simple scaling prediction of the
population for general L in agreement with the simulations: Results depend
on xL as seen in Fig.2. For example, the critical point at birth rate B is at
x = (1 + B/2)−1/L.

Real animals get old with increasing age, and that can be simulated with
similar techniques. The more complicated Penna bit-string model [6] simu-
lates the ageing of individuals and agrees well with the empirical Gompertz
law of 1825, that the mortality of adult humans increases exponentially with
age [1].

3 Language Competition

Every ten days on average one human language dies out. Simulations of the
bit-string Schulze model are very similar to the above population genetics,
with random mutations, transfer of language bits from one language to an-
other, and ﬂight from small to large languages [7]. The alternative Viviane
model [8] simpliﬁes mutation and ﬂight from small to large languages into
one process, and ignores transfer. It gives in Fig.3 a wide range of language

sizes, i.e. of the number of people speaking one language, from dying lan-
guages with only one speaker, to Chinese with 109 speakers. The Schulze
model gives a more realistic nearly log-normal shape for this distributions,
but not the wide range of language sizes. Both the proper shape and the large
size range of reality (bottom part of Fig.3) might come from non-equilibrium
statistics.

In the last version of the Schulze model, each language (better interpre-
tation: its grammar) is characterized by F features each of which can adopt
one of Q diﬀerent integer values 1, 2, ...Q. Each site of a large square lattice is
occupied by a person speaking one language. At each iteration, each feature
of each person is mutated with probability p. This mutation is random with
probability 1 − q while with probability q the corresponding feature from one
of the four lattice neighbours is adopted. Also, at each iteration, each person
independently, with a probability proportional to 1 − x2 abandons the whole
language and adopts the language of one randomly selected person in the
population.

In the last version of the Viviane model, each lattice site is either empty
of carries a population with a size randomly ﬁxed between 1 and, say, like
127. Initially one lattice site is occupied and all others are empty. Then at
each time step one empty neighbour of an occupied site is occupied with a
probability proportional to the number of people which can live there. Then
this new site adopts the language of one of its four lattice neighbours, with a
probability proportional to the size of the language spoken at that neighbour
site. However, this adopted language is mutated to a new language with
probability inversely proportional to the new size of the adopted language.
(This denominator is not allowed to exceed a maximum, set randomly be-
tween 1 and, say, 2048.) The whole process ends once the last lattice site has
become occupied.

4 Opinion Dynamics

Can a single person make a diﬀerence in public life? In chaos theory we ask
whether a single butterﬂy in Brazil can inﬂuence a hurrican in the Caribbean.
Kauﬀman [4] asked the analogous question whether a single biological muta-
tion has a minor eﬀect or disturbs the whole genetic network [4]. Physicists
call this damage spreading and ask, for example, how the evolution of an
Ising model is changed if one single spin is ﬂipped and otherwise the sys-

6

tem, including the random numbers to simulate it, remains unperturbed.
This question was discussed [10, 1] for three models: The opportunists of
Krause and Hegselmann [11], the negotiators of Deﬀuant et al [12], and the
missionaries of Sznajd [13].

The opportunists take as their new opinion the average opinion of the
large population to which they belong, except that they ignore those who
diﬀer too much from their own opinion. Also the negotiators ignore opinions
which diﬀer too much from their own; otherwise a randomly selected pair gets
closer in their two opinions without necessarily agreeing fully. A randomly
selected pair of missionaries, neighbouring on a lattice or network, convinces
its neighbours if and only if the two people in the pair have the same opinion.
Simulations show that the opinion change of a single person may inﬂuence
the whole population for suitable parameters [10, 1].

For the missionaries on a scale-free network, simulations agreed nicely

with election results in Brazil, apart from ﬁtted scale factors, Fig.4.

5 Market Fluctuations

How can we get rich fast by speculating on the stock market? This writer
earned about one Heugel (a local currency unit of about 104 Euro) by be-
lieving some theory for the Tokyo stock market [15]. Details, of course, are
given out only for more JUMP time. Instead this section summarizes the
Cont-Bouchaud model of stock market ﬂuctuations [16], because it is closest
to the pre-existing physics model of percolation.

Each site of a large square lattice is either occupied by an investor (with
probability p), or empty with probability 1 − p. Sets of occupied neighbours
are called clusters and are identiﬁed with groups of investors which act (buy
or sell) together. At each iteration a cluster either buys (with probability a),
sells (also with probability a) or sleeps (with probability 1 − 2a). The traded
amount is proportional to the number of investors in the trading cluster.

The diﬀerence between supply and demand drives the market values up and
down. This basic model gives on average: i) as many ups as downs on the
market; ii) a power-law decay (“fat tail”) for the probability to have a large
price change, and with modiﬁcations also: iii) volatility clustering (markets
have turbulent and calm times), iv) eﬀective multi-fractality, v) sharp peaks
and ﬂat valleys for the prices, but no prediction on how the market will move
tomorrow.

Apart from these nice basic properties also practical applications were
made [17]: Does a small “Tobin” tax of a few tenths of a percent on all
transactions reduce ﬂuctuations and earn tax revenue without killing the
whole market? It does, but apart from more government control over indi-
viduals there is another danger which can be simulated: If the tax revenue
increases with increasing tax rate, then governments will be tempted to in-
crease this tax again and again (as Germans just saw in fall 2005 and German
student may observe in future tuition hikes.) Much better is a maximum of
tax revenue at some moderate tax rate; then the government should settle on
this moderate tax rate, provided it regards the simulations as reliable. Fig.5
shows that in this model such a desirable maximum exists for some param-
eters but not for all. Another application is the conﬁrmation that halting
the trade when excessive price changes are observed indeed helps to calm the
market.

6 Discussion

Interdisciplinary applications of physics methods are no longer as exotic as
they were years ago; biologists and economists have started to publish papers
together with computational physicists on these non-physics ﬁelds.

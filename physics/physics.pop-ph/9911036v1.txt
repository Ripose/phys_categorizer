9.84 vs. 9.84:
The Battle of Bruny and Bailey

Abstract

At the recent 1999 World Athletics Championships in Sevilla, Spain, Canada’s Bruny Surin matched Donovan Bailey’s
National and former World Record 100 m mark of 9.84 s. The unoﬃcial times for each, as read from the photo-ﬁnish,

were 9.833 s and 9.835 s respectively. Who, then, is the fastest Canadian of all time? A possible solution is oﬀered,

accounting for drag eﬀects resulting from ambient tail-winds and altitude.

From the moment Bruny Surin’s silver-clad Seville performance popped up on the screen, it was

only a matter of time before the question was raised.

This story, of course, has its roots in the July 27, 1996 performance of one Donovan Bailey,
Canada’s prime hopeful at the centennial Olympic Games in Atlanta. Coming from behind, Dono-
van shifted to a gear which that day only he possessed, surging ahead to the tape in a World Record
mark of 9.84s. Fast forward to August 22, 1999: Montreal’s Bruny Surin battles for global century
supremacy with the formidable Maurice Greene, who a shy 2 months earlier had eclipsed Bailey’s
world mark in an ominously reminiscent 9.79s. Although falling mildly short of his rival’s 9.80s gold
medal romp, Surin’s time was far from disappointing, yet in a way uniquely Canadian: 9.84s.

The score so far: 9.84s Bailey, 9.84s Surin– but is a 9.84s always a 9.84s? Without delving too
deeply into the philosophical, one needs to address the standards of electronic timing. For those
not familiar with the equipment, the top-of-the-line photo-ﬁnish cameras actually sample at 0.001s,
implying that the athletes’ performances are initially recorded to three decimal places. For various
reasons, the precision is only kept to two places, but the rounding process isn’t quite scientiﬁc.
Unless the third decimal place is ’0’, the times are rounded up to the next highest hundredth. So,
two performances can be up to 0.009s apart, and still be regarded as “equal”!

Herein lies our current dilemma. In a recent issue of Athletics [1], it was pointed out that Bailey’s
9.84 s was initially a 9.835 s, while Surin’s 9.84 s was really 9.833 s. How does reaction time ﬁt in?
Donovan slept in the blocks for 0.174 s (a potential nail-in-the-coﬃn for an Olympic ﬁnal!), while
Bruny blasted ahead of his ﬁeld in 0.127 s. So, after a little math, Surin clocks in with 9.706 s, but
Bailey now leads at 9.661 s.

Is Donovan’s performance truly of Olympic proportions, as compared to Bruny’s?? In case you
didn’t see this coming (by now you should all know better), we can’t disregard two vital pieces of
data: wind speed and altitude! The measurements in question were +0.7 m/s in Atlanta (approxi-
mately 315 m above sea level), and +0.2 m/s in Seville (about 12 m above sea level). Since a tail-wind
boosts a sprint time, Bailey’s +0.7 m/s tail gave him more of an advantage than Surin’s +0.2 m/s.
However, a higher altitude sprint is easier than one closer to sea level– hence, a Seville race will be
slower than one in Atlanta! What to do?? Is this debate destined for the ﬁles of Unsolved Mysteries?

Through the miracle of numerical modeling, it’s possible to estimate the beneﬁt associated with

each statistic. Drag is calculated as

where A is the cross-sectional area of the sprinter, Cd is the drag coeﬃcient, ρ the density of the
air, v the sprinter’s speed, and w the wind speed. Note the dependence on ρ and w: the higher
the altitude, the thinner the air, the lower the value of ρ. Likewise, the stronger the tail wind, the
smaller (v −w)2 gets. Hence, both imply a lower overall drag on the sprinter. Since the eﬀect of wind
will vary with altitude, it’s reasonable to convert all performances to their sea level equivalent (or 0
metres altitude). The following chart gives a quick indication of the degree to which a 9.72 s sea-level
clocking (assuming reaction is subtracted) will be boosted by diﬀering wind and altitude conditions.
The last row represents the elevation of Mexico City, to give appreciation for the advantage experi-
ence in the 1968 Olympics (the density of air is roughly 76− 78% that at sea level, so clearly with the
right tail wind, it’s no wonder that the sprints and jumps experienced record-breaking performances).

Plugging the numbers into my model [2], I ﬁnd the following quick ﬁgures: the altitude+wind
combo for Bailey implies that his race would be equivalent to roughly a 9.719 s (+0.044 s from
just wind; +0.058 s combined). Surin’s race would correspond to a 9.720 s century (+0.013 s wind;
+0.014 s combined).

There we have it:

instead of 9.84 vs. 9.84, after correcting for reaction time and drag eﬀects,
we end up with 9.720 s vs. 9.719 s. Since exact values of Cd and A are unknown, their estimation
introduces a degree of uncertainty to any calculation. So, it’s certainly not unreasonable to expect
that this could account for a 0.001s discrepancy, implying that Bailey’s and Surin’s times are eﬀec-
tively indistinguishable!

Thus, whose 9.84 s is faster? According to these preliminary results: they’re both the fastest.
But, with two 9.84 s clockings toping the national list, Canada certainly comes out ahead. Perhaps
the 2000 season will shed some deﬁnitive light on the individual battle.

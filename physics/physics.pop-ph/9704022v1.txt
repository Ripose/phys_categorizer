Abstract

The mathematical model of J. Keller for predicting World Record race times, based on a
simple diﬀerential equation of motion, predicted quite well the records of the day. One

of its shortcoming is that it neglects to account for a sprinter’s energy loss around a

curve, a most important consideration particularly in the 200m–400m. An extension to

Keller’s work is considered, modeling the aforementioned energy loss as a simple function

of the centrifugal force acting on the runner around the curve. Theoretical World Record

performances for indoor and outdoor 200m are discussed, and the use of the model at

300m is investigated. Some predictions are made for possible 200m outdoor and indoor

times as run by Canadian 100m WR holder Donovan Bailey, based on his 100m ﬁnal

performance at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta.

Introduction

In 1973, mathematician J. Keller [1] proposed a model for predicting World
Record (WR) race times based on a simple least–square ﬁt of the records of
the day. The ﬁt was quite good, and provided a simple tool for gauging pos-
sible optimual performances in races, based on results from others. Keller’s
model was limiting in the sense that it could only “in reality” predict pos-
sible records of linear races, with no consideration for those run on curves.
For distance races (over 400m), this correction is negligible. When the race
speeds are much higher, though, the curve contributions cannot be left out.

Recent WR performances in athletics have prompted various new stud-
ies based on Keller’s work. The author of [2] introduces a more realistic
energy–loss model for sprinting, accounting for the sprinter’s actual veloc-
ity curve. Still, though, the curve is not considered; this is mentioned in
[2], but no solution is oﬀered. The following work will formulate a simple
model to account for energy loss around the curve, and predict possible
WR performances accordingly, using data obtained from a least–square ﬁt
of contemporary short sprint records. Both outdoor races, as well as indoor
competitions, are discussed. As a practical example, the 100m WR sprint
race of Donovan Bailey (Canada) is used as empirical data to further de-
termine the validity of the model for predicting 200m sprint times. A brief
discussion of indoor 300m records is oﬀered. The possibility of using such a
model as a training tool for athletes and coaches in considered.

2 The Keller Model

Although mathematical models for running were ﬁrst introduced by A. V.
Hill [3] in the mid–1920s, it was J. Keller who formulated a model to predict
possible WR performances [1], based on the notion that the speed and energy
loss of a human can be determined by certain key variables. In its simplest
form, the Keller (or Hill–Keller) model is a solution to the simple equation
of motion

˙v(t) = f (t) − τ

v(t) ,

−1

Here, f (t) is the force per unit mass exerted by the runner, and τ is a decay
constant which models internal (physiological) resistances felt by the runner.
The diﬀerential equation (1) is solved subject to the constraint v(0) = 0,
and also bearing in mind that f (t) ≤ f (i.e. the runner can only exert so
much force). The length of the race d can be calculated as

and the time T to run the race can be obtained for a particular velocity
curve v(t) over d. An additional constraint is that the power f (t) · v(t)
must equal the rate of internal energy supply (cellular oxygen replacement,
anaerobic reactions, etc...),

with σ a physiological term representing the body’s energy balance. This is
coupled with the initial condition E(0) = E0, as well as the non–negativity
of E(t) (E(t) ≥ 0) [1].

By variational methods, it was determined [1] that the optimal strategy
for short sprints (d < 291m = dcrit) is for the runner to go all–out for the
duration of the race. That is, f (t) = f . Hence, v(t) and d can be calculated
simply as

v(t) = f τ (1 − e

−t/τ ) ,

d = f τ

T /τ + e

.

For races of d > dcrit, the runner should chose a diﬀerent optimization
strategy. The parameters determined by Keller are [1]

τ = 0.892 s

f = 12.2 m/s

2

σ = 9.83 cal/(kg s)

E0 = 575 cal/kg

Keller [1] determined the optimal times (and hence WRs) for short
sprints, and found: 50m - 5.48s, 60m - 6.40s, 100m - 10.07s, 200m - 19.25m,
400m - 43.27s. Although 400m is beyond the short sprint category, this
time is cited because of it’s incredible approximation to the current record
(43.29s, Harry “Butch” Reynolds, 1988). Andre Cason’s (USA) 6.41s 60m
WR is also surprisingly close.

3 Tibshirani’s Extension

It is somewhat unrealistic to believe that a sprinter can actually apply a
constant force for the duration of a race. This being said, it seems logical
to assume the force f (t) decreases with time.
In the case of [2], a linear
decrease was chosen, f (t) = f − ct, where c > 0. In this case, the equations
of motion become

v(t) = k − ctτ − ke

−t/τ ,

D(t) = kt −

cτ t

+ τ k(e

−t/τ − 1) ,

with k = f τ + τ 2c.

More complex time dependences could equivalently be chosen (for ex-
ample, it might be more appealing to chose a time dependence of the form
f (t) = f exp(−βt)), but for the purposes of this study, the linar one will
suﬃce.

3.1 Accounting for reaction time

The values in (5) were calculated without consideration of reaction time on
the part of the athlete. The IAAF sets the lowest possible reaction time by a
human being to be treac = 0.100s; any sprinter who reacts faster than this is
charged with a false start. These times generally do not drop below +0.130s,
and in general register around +0.150s (the average reaction time for the
100m and 200m ﬁnals at the 1996 Olympic Games was roughly +0.16s).
Granted, the ability to react quickly is an important strategy, and obviously
one which cannot really be ﬁt into a model. At the 1996 Olympic Games,
American sprinter Jon Drummond registered a reaction time of +0.116s
(100m, round 2, heat 2), and in the semi–ﬁnal defending champion Linford
Christie (GBR) reacted in +0.124s [5]. Such quick reactions tend to be
more a result of anticipating the starter’s gun, though, rather than purely
electrophysiological manifestations.

4 Physical Meaning of the Parameters

Although mathematical in origin, it is reasonable to hypothesize what might
be the physical interpretation of the parameters (f, τ, c). Clearly, f is a
measure of the raw acceleration capability of the sprinter, while f τ , having
units of ms−1, is a representation of velocity. In fact, this is the maximum
velocity which the sprinter is capable of attaining (in the Keller model only;
in the Tibshirani extension, the expression is slightly more complicated).
The variable c must have units of f /t, hence ms−3. Ideally, this is the time
rate of change of the runner’s output, and can be thought of as a measure of
muscular endurance. The full implications of τ are unclear, but due to the
nature of the equation of motion, and keeping in mind the initial conjecture
of Keller that it be a function of internal resistances, one could hypothesize
τ to be some type of measure of such elements as ﬂexibility, leg turnover
rate, anaerobic responses, and so forth.

While not necessarily representative of any exact physics quantity, these
parameters may have some physical analogue. The mechanics of sprint-

4

ing are far more complicated than the model suggests. However, the mere
fact that these models can predict race times with surprising accuracy indi-
cates that perhaps they can be of some use in training. One could imagine
that a determination of the set (f, τ, c) for athletes can help to gear work-
outs toward speciﬁc development (power, endurance, and so forth). Further
investigation of the consistency of the model for various athletes might con-
sidered.

200m races: Adjusting for the Curve

It is the opinion of this author that the way a sprinter handles the curve
portion of a race, in particular a 200m, cannot be discounted. Exactly how
this should be taken into consideration is unknown, as there are surely vari-
ous factors (both physical and physiological) which must be addressed. The
only physical diﬀerence between straight running and curve running is obvi-
ously the eﬀects of centrifugal forces on the sprinter. One can assume that a
sprinter’s racing spikes provide ample traction to stop outward translational
motion, so this is not a concern. To compensate for the rotational eﬀects
(torques), the sprinter leans into the turn. This is not constant during the
race; greater speeds require greater lean. However, the degree of lean is lim-
ited by the maximum outward angle of ﬂexion of the ankle. Furthermore,
one would think that maximum propulsive eﬃciency would not be generated
at this extreme limit.

So, a curve model is not a trivial one to construct. However, based on
the physical considerations alone, let us assume that the eﬀect will manifest
itself as a centrifugal term in the equation of motion. Since this is normal
to the forward motion of the sprinter, we can rewrite (1) as

(8)

(cid:16)

The term λ < 0 has been added to account for the fact that a sprinter does
not feel the full centrifugal force resulting from his angular velocity. This
seems to be the simplest choice, at least for a ﬁrst approximation to the
correction. Clearly, the Hill–Keller model is regained in the limit R → ∞
(alternatively λ → 0).

The radius of curvature R can have two distinct sets of values, depending

on whether the competition is indoor or out,

(9)

Here, p is the lane number, and the factors 1.25 (outdoor) and 1.00 (indoor)
have been chosen as suitable representations of IAAF regulation lane widths,
according to the following standards [4]:

• Outdoor: 400m in the inside lane, comprised of two 100m straights,
and two 100m curves of ﬁxed radius. Lane widths can range between
1.22 and 1.25 m, and are separated by lines of width 5 cm.

• Indoor: 200m in the inside lane (two 50m straights, and two 50m
curves). The lanes (4 minimum, 6 maximum) should be between 0.90m
to 1.10m in width, separated by a 5cm thick white line. The curve may
be banked up to 18o, and should have a radius between 11m and 21m.
The radius need not be constant.

Solving Equation (8) for ˙v(t), with f (t) = f , one obtains

˙v(t) = −τ

Equivalently, for Tibshirani’s more realistic model (f (t) = f − ct), Equa-
tion (10) becomes

˙v(t) = −τ

v(t) +

−1

(f − ct)2 − λ2 v(t)4

Because of a current lack of necessary empirical sprint data, the value of λ
can only be estimated.

Diﬀerential equations of the form (10), (11) are not trivial to solve, as
they yield no explicit solutions for v(t). However, such are easily solved
by numerical methods. This was performed on the MAPLE V Release 4
mathematical utility package, which uses a fourth-ﬁfth order Runge–Kutta
method.

The race distance d traversed around the curve in time T can be calcu-

lated analogously to Equation (2),

with vc(t) the solution to Equation (11), and vs(t) the velocity as expressed
in Equation (7), solved for the boundary condition vc(t1) = vs(t1). Here,
t1 is the time required to run the curved portion of the race (distance dc),
the integral form of which is evaluated numerically, based on the method of
calculation stated for vc(t).

By using Keller’s parameters (5), we can correct his original prediction of
19.25s to account for the curve. In fact, as an aside, it should be mentioned
that the record of 19.5s as indicated in [1] is in fact the straight–track record
of Tommie Smith, from 1966 [4]. With this in mind, we can apply the result
of (10), coupled with (13), to obtain a curved–track WR estimate. For an
assumed λ2 = 0.60 (see section 9.1 for a discussion on choice of its value):

(12)

(13)

v100 = 10.66 m/s ,

t100 = 10.24 s ,

t200 = 19.46 s .

The IAAF notes that times run on curves were estimated to be 0.3 to 0.4s
slower than straight runs [4]. These results would tend to agree with this
assertion.

6 New Model Parameters for Modern World Records

The parameters (5) are more than likely out of date, as they were calculated
by ﬁtting records almost 25 years old [1]. Also, these were ﬁtted for a
model which does not accurately model the velocity curves of sprinters. For
example, a 100m runner’s velocity is not strictly increasing, but rather peaks
between 40 and 60m. Table 1 lists the sprint WRs as of March 1997, from
50m to 400m [4, 5].

New parameters (f, τ ) and (f, τ, c) have been obtained by a least–square
ﬁt to the four straight–track sprint WRs (50m, 55m, 60m, and 100m), and
are listed in (15,16). These reproduce the short sprint times quite well
(Table 2). Aside from the 100m WR (where the reaction time is known,

7

treact = +0.174s [8]), a (perhaps liberal) reaction time of +0.16s has been
assumed. By using the indoor races to calculate parameters, one is inher-
ently removing the possibility of wind–assisted times. This has not been
done in the case of the 100m WR (where the wind–reading was +0.7 m/s
[8]), which may provide some source of error1

with (lower, upper) asymptotic 95% conﬁdence levels of f = (10.060, 10.399),
τ = (1.124, 1.170), and

f = 10.230 m/s

2

τ = 1.147 s

f = 9.596 m/s

τ = 1.274 s

c = 0.058 m/s

(14)

(15)

with (lower, upper) asymptotic 95% conﬁdence levels of f = (8.290, 10.901),
τ = (0.981, 1.567), c = (−0.065, 0.180).

In light of the discussions of Tibshirani’s extension with relation to ob-
served velocity curves, the parameters (15) are cited only for comparison
with older values (although predictions using (15) are oﬀered in Table 4,
as a comparison to Keller’s results). Otherwise, this work will use only the
parameters of (16).

7 Predicting the 200m World Record

By a straight application of the model as described above, it is possible to
obtain predicted WR times for the 200m sprint. In addition, it seems logical
to obtain predictions for indoor 200m races, as well, where the dynamics
of curve sprinting should be more apparent. For outdoor performances,
dc = 100m in (13), and ds = 100m, and this is the same for all lane choices
p = 1 − 8. Recall that dc is not the curve–length for all lanes, only the
distance run on the curve. For indoor races, the total distance is calculated
by

1

Prictchard [6] oﬀers a simple method of accounting for wind assistance and drag.
Making use of his work, one ﬁnds that in fact Donovan Bailey’s 9.84s WR corrects to a 9.88s
still–wind reading. This is surpassed by Frank Fredricks 9.86s run with a wind reading of
−0.4m/s, which adjusts to roughly 9.84s [7]. So, if we account for wind contributions, a
similar time is obtained anyway.

8

d = dc1 + ds + dc2 + ds ,

(16)

where dc1,2 depend on the lane choice. Since standard indoor tracks are
200m in lane 1, it follows that dc1 = dc2 = ds = 50m. The radius obviously
increases for subsequent lanes, and using (9), one obtains dc1 = 40.58m and
dc2 = 59.42m. The latter value is the total length of the curved portion of
lane 4, while the former is the distance run after the stagger.

For all tables, unless otherwise indicated the times listed will be raw
(i.e. minus reaction time). Only the ﬁnal race times include reaction, as
indicated in the column headings.

7.1 Outdoor 200m
Calculations using various values of increasing λ (λ2) are detailed in Table 5
and Table 6. For outdoor races (Table 5), a λ2 range of 0.50-0.80 has been
used. Before the 1996 Olympic Games, the estimated times given would
have been considered almost unbelievable. However, in light of the current
200m WR (at the time of writing), the times are not so far fetched. The
19s–barrier is on the verge of being broken for λ2 = 0.50, while for higher λ2,
the current WR is approached. It is interesting to note that, for λ2 = 1.00,
the model predicts a time of 19.30s, quite close to Michael Johnson’s 19.32s.
These predictions are ideally for zero–wind readings, while the 19.32s was
assisted with a wind of +0.4m/s. It is quite possible that Johnson will again
lower his 200m WR mark this coming summer (1997), so we could very well
see times in the range predicted in Table 5.

As a comparison to Keller’s prediction of 19.25s [1], which can be con-
sidered a straight–track 200m (λ2 = 0), this model yields t200 = 18.54s +
0.16s = 18.70s, with a split of 9.67s (which is just the prediction for the
100m WR).

7.2

Indoor 200m

Indoor tracks have much shorter radii of curvature than do outdoor tracks.
The centrifugal forces acting on a sprinter will be much higher for large vc, so
it makes sense that the value of λ assigned to subsequent calculations should
be lower than for outdoor ones. This is physically realized by banked turns
on indoor tracks, which are generally 2–4 feet at maximum height. How
much lower a value of λ one should choose probably depends on the height
of the particular bank, so again no accurate estimate can be made. Due to

9

the R1 force dependence, then a λ (λ2) ratio in the range of 2:1 (4:1) might be
expected for an outdoor:indoor ratio (under the assumption that the average
maximal velocity about the curve is the same). Accurate measurements
time and velocity measurements at the end of each race segment (curves
and straights) have been calculated, and accurate measurement of these
quantities can help determine validity of the model (see Table 11).

Frank Fredricks of Namibia broke the 20s barrier indoors in 1996 (see
Table 1), setting a new 200m indoor WR of 19.96s. This can be used to
estimate possible values of λ that could be used. Clearly, any value under
λ2 = 0.60 is quite reasonable, and in fact the 19.51s prediction for λ2 = 0.40
is attractive, as it does not seem beyond the realm of possibility. This does
not follow the 4:1 ratio outlined above, however there is no real reason to
believe that is should. The only real stipulation is that indoor values of λ
should be smaller than outdoor ones.

7.3 Can the 19s barrier be broken?
Suppose that a value of λ2 = 0.60 holds for outdoor performances (this
assumption is based on results of Section 9.1). The predicted 200m record
is 19.08s, assuming a reaction of +0.16s (Table 5). The minimum possible
time allowed without a false start being called would be 19.02s (this, of
course, assumes no wind speed, for which the predictions have been made;
if there is a suﬃcient legal tail–wind, the mark would certainly fall). How
should this athlete train in order to break the 19s barrier?

A 0.4% increase in the value of f would give a raw time of 18.85s, with a
100m split of 9.94s (v100 = 11.10 m/s). Whereas, a larger decrease of 9% in
c (greater “endurance”) would yield a raw time of 18.83s, with a marginally
slower split of t100 = 9.95s, but a slighlty faster v100 = 11.11 m/s. This is
an extreme case, but does show how the model parameters might be useful
to athletes and coaches as a training gauge.

Various articles [9, 10] have made attempts to predict the future trends
of WR performances, and the former states that a sub–19.0s 200m could be
realized by 2040 (although it also predicts a 100m time of 9.49s to match).
The authors of [10] are more optimistic, predicting a WR of 18.97s being
set as early as 2004. While their prediction of 19.52s for 1977 is oﬀ, it might
be retroactively made consistent by Michael Johnson’s 19.32s WR from the
1996 Olympic Games. If the predicted times of Table 5 are near accurate,
and considering the simple argument above, then the 2004 projection may
not be far oﬀ the mark.

Is the 300m Now a Short Sprint?

Keller determined that the maximum distance over which an athlete could
run using the strategy f (t) = f was dcrit = 291m [1]. Likewise, physiologists
have suggested that a human cannot run at full speed for longer that 30s (see
[6] and references therein). While the latter study is just over 10 years old,
one wonders whether or not dcrit has dropped. Alternatively, if a sprinter
can run a sub–30s 300m, would this entail that the diﬀerent strategy used
for races longer than 291m no longer applies?

As with the 200m, Table 7 outlines possible 300m record times, as run
in lane 4 of a standard indoor track. Since the actual (if there is one) value
of λ2 is unknown, a range of 0.30–0.50 is chosen in light of the 200m results.
In the case of lane 4, the race is made up of the segments

d = dc1 + ds + dc2 + ds + dc3 + ds

= 31.16m + 50m + 59.42m + 50m + 59.42m + 50m .

(17)

The estimated time for the ﬁrst two choices of λ2 are under the 30s
barrier by more than half a second, while λ2 = 0.5 yields a value of 29.72s
(with reaction). Comparison to the current WR of 32.19s (Table 1) give
time diﬀerentials of approximately 2.49s–3.06s! The 300m times may be a
product of a decaying ﬁt to the data. However, the time diﬀerentials cited
appear far too large to be manifestations of statistical error alone, which
would suggest that there is an additional mechanism (perhaps physiological
in origin) at work over this distance. This approach would suggest that the
300m is still not a sprint, by the deﬁnition of Keller [1].

9 A Practical Application: Donovan Bailey

On Saturday, July 27th, 21:00 EST, Donovan Bailey (DB) of Canada crossed
the 100m ﬁnish line in a new WR time of 9.84s (+0.7 m/s wind). Thanks to
excellent documentation of data from this race, it is possible to ﬁnd an “ex-
act” solution2 to the equations 7, and hence solve them for the parameters
(f, τ, c). The relevant data for the race is [8],

2

It is emphasized that, while it is possible to obtain an exact set of values for the
parameters, these are not DB’s parameters, since the model does not account for wind
assistance and drag.

(21)

vmax = 12.1m/s ,
dvmax = 59.50m ,
v100 = 11.5m/s ,

Since the system equations used are diﬀerent than Keller’s, the maximum
velocity will not be simply vmax = f τ . The maximum value of v(t) is found
to be

vmax = f τ + cτ

ln

c
f /τ + c (cid:27)

(cid:26)

.

wth dv(tmax)/dt = 0. The values (f, τ, c) = (7.96, 1.72, 0.156) are thus ob-
tained. These can be compared with those obtained in [2] by a least–square
ﬁt to the oﬃcial splits listed in Table 8: (f, τ, c) = (6.41, 2.39, 0.20). Note
that the higher value of f and lower values of τ, c are likely a manifestation
of solution method and accounting for reaction time.

9.1 Predicting DB’s 200m times

Using the parameters obtained in Section 9, and the model framework es-
tablished in Section 5, 200m times will be obtained for DB as run on both
indoor and outdoor tracks. Resulting split times are “raw” (i.e. without
reaction time), but the ﬁnal time will be given both with and without reac-
tion time (roughly 0.15s, which is faster than his 1996 Olympic 100m ﬁnal
reaction time 0f 0.174s).

Table 9 shows calculated times and velocities for DB running in lane 4
(p = 4) for varying values of λ2. Since the actual value of this parameter
is unknown, in order to determine its possible value predicted times will be
matched with DB’s past 200m performances. While no conclusive value of
λ2 could be determined from Section 6, perhaps DB’s performances can help
shed light. The IAAF lists [4] his best 200m clocking as 20.76s, with a 20.39s
wind–assisted performance, in 1994. Assuming that his time will be lower
in 1997 (but most likely not world–class, or sub–20s, due to his training as a
100m specialist), it wil be assumed that DB is currently capable of running
roughly 20.20–20.30s. This would tend to favor a value of λ2 between 0.50
and 0.70. Predicted indoor performances are listed in Table 10.

For indoor 200m, Bailey’s performance seems to greatly suﬀer for large
λ, which further supports the claim of smaller values for indoor tracks. A

12

200m clocking above 21s is hardly expected by a world class sprinter! In
fact, even the 21s times (λ2 = 0.40, 0.50) seem somewhat slow for the 100m
WR holder. These could suggest that the indoor λ be quite low (λ2 < 0.4).
Analogous to Table 11, segment times and velocities for DB have been

calculated, and are listed in Table 12.

10 Discussion and General Conclusions

This model is not intended to serve as gospel of how sprinters perform;
surely, it is crude at best. However, it can be used as a simple tool to gauge
what kind of records might be expected, based on present performances.
Due to the “loose” statistical ﬁt of the data from lack of points, the WRs
of Section 7 may be somewhat overestimated. DB’s predicted performances
of Section 9.1 are probably more representative of the possible range of λ2
values that one might realistically expect, if such a model holds. That is, if
he is capable of running the 200m in the range of 20.15–20.40s, then if λ2 is
the same for all runners, possible values lie between λ2 = 0.40−0.60. A value
of λ2 = 1.00, while closely reproducing the current 200m WR, is deﬁnitely
wrong from this observational point of view: it would greatly underestimate
Bailey’s potential (t > 20.60s would hardly be expected by a WR holding
sprinter, regardless of specialization).

The following points should be considered, though:

• λ2 is not the same for indoor and outdoor races; indoor tracks would

favor lower λ, so long as they are banked

• λ2 may not be the same for all athletes; 200m specialists handle turns
It may be an indivudual

with greater ease than 100m specialists.
parameter, like (f, τ, c).

• due to physiological considerations (diﬀerent posture assumed or mus-
cles/joints used, etc...), it seems more likely that the values of τ and/or
c may change around the curve

• if the eﬀect is purely physical, then the individual lane records should
be strictly decreasing from lane 1 to lane 8. The recorded records
(Table 3) suggest that a minimal race time is achieved around lane 3
or 4, contributing to the physiological nature of curve running.

13

The results of this paper are limited by the availability of relevant data,
unfortunately. It would perhaps be of future interest to investigate the phys-
ical nature of the parameters (f, τ, c, λ) through study of various athletes.
By knowing the eﬀects of their variability on predicted times, models such
as these could perhaps be used as a new training tool to gauge and direct
the training of World Class athletes.

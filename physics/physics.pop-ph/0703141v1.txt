Abstract

A fascinating new generation of experiments has determined certain
meson scattering parameters at high precision. A conﬂuence of highly so-
phisticated theory as well as new experimental ideas have led to this state
of aﬀairs, which sheds important light on the properties of the strong in-
teractions. A brief review of the experiments and the theory is presented.

The NA48 collaboration in CERN has recently provided information through
two independent measurements of combinations of so-called scattering lengths
associated with the scattering of two pions. The experiment is based on in
CERN’s highest-intensity proton beamline and uses a large and sophisticated
detector.

The ﬁrst measurement by the NA48/2 experiment [1] comes from a recently
proposed idea due to Cabibbo [2] to measure a ‘cusp’ in the invariant mass
distribution of pions resulting from the decay of the kaons. A cusp at an energy
corresponding to 2mπ+ in the number distribution of the neutral pion pair as
a function of their invariant mass, manifests itself as an abrupt change in the
derivative of the number distribution. It is a very ﬁne eﬀect and can be seen only
if the sample size of events that are analyzed is very large. The event sample here
is enormous and is based on about 27 million ‘events’ K ± → π±π0π0. In units
in which the mass of the charged pion mπ+ is set to unity, they obtain for the
combination of scattering lengths |a0
0 − a2
0| the value 0.264 ± 0.015, an accurate
measurement of what was a rather poorly measured experimental quantity.

In the expression above, the aI

0, I = 0, 2 are called scattering lengths, the
subscript denoted by I stands for ‘iso-spin’ and the subscript 0 denotes the
fact that this is the scattering length of the angular momentum l = 0 channel
(S-wave scattering length). Pions, which come in three varieties π+, π−, and
π0, are the lightest of all strongly interacting particles, and are bound states of
quark and anti-quark pairs of u- and d- varieties. Heavier counterparts where
one of these is replaced by the s- quark are the kaons. Pions hold the key to
our understanding of the strong interactions, which are resisted analytic solu-
tion in the low-energy domain. The strong interactions at the microscopic level
are described by quantum chromodynamics (QCD) which is a theory in which
the degrees of freedom are the quarks and gluons, while at macroscopic length
scales one observes mesons (pions, kaons, etc.) and baryons (protons, neutrons,

1

hyperons, etc.). The lightness of the pions on the hadronic scale (mπ0 ≃ 135
MeV, mπ+ ≃ 139 MeV (we have set the velocity of light, c = 1, a common
convention)) is today understood in terms of a phenomenon called spontaneous
symmetry breaking of a global symmetry. It is common in scattering experi-
ments to decompose the scattering amplitude, viz., namely the mathematical
expression that governs the strength with with a projectile is scattered into a
speciﬁc direction by a target, into ‘partial wave amplitudes’ each of which has a
deﬁnite angular momentum l¯h; the S- wave corresponds to the part that is in-
dependent of the scattering angle. Finally, we note here that the pions lie in an
‘iso-triplet’, correspond to isospin 1. Therefore pion-pion scattering amplitudes
could carry isospin of 0, 1, 2 (addition of two isospins I1 and I2, imply that the
total isospin could lie between I1+I2 and |I1−I2|). The advantage of the iso-spin
amplitudes is that the amplitudes for all the physical processes, π+π+ → π+π+,
π−π+ → π−π+, π−π− → π−π−, π+π− ↔ π0π0, and π0π0 → π0π0 may all be
expressed in terms of these, when the mass diﬀerence of the charged and neutral
pions is neglected.

The second technique employed by the NA48 collaboration, results from
which are still preliminary, comes from a rare decay of kaons in which a lepton
and anti-lepton pair and two pions are produced in the decay. The rescattering
of the pions in the ﬁnal state can actually be observed and provides a sensitive
laboratory for the strength of the interaction of these particles. The names of
the famous scientists A. Pais and S. Treiman, and those of N. Cabibbo and A.
Maksymowicz are associated with this eﬀect. Based on this technique and on
the analysis of 370, 000 decays a prelimary number for the scattering length a0
0
is given as 0.256 ± 0.011, according to summary talks posted on the web-site of
the collaboration in September 2006. The E865 experiment at the Brookhaven
National Laboratory, USA also uses the rare kaon decay to analyze 400, 000
events and measured this quantity to be 0.216±0.015 [3]. These two experiments
in addition to low-energy phase shift also rely on what is known as Roy equation
analysis which is described in some detail later in this article.

Another important experiment called DIRAC which stands for the Di-Meson
Relativistic Atom complex is an experiment that uses highly sophisticated ex-
perimental techniques to get two charged pions to bind through the electromag-
netic interaction to form a so-called pionium atom which then scatters into two
neutral pions in the ground state of the atom, upon which the electromagnetic
interaction is switched oﬀ and the neutral pions then scatter oﬀ. The lifetime
of this state provides an accurate measurement of the same diﬀerence of two
scattering lengths as in the cusp experiment of NA48, an eﬀect predicted in a
diﬀerent setting over 50 years ago by a highly distinguished set of authors: S.
Deser, M. L. Goldberger, K. Baumann and W. E. Thirring [4]. Based on a har-
vest of 6, 600 pionium atoms the experiment reports the value of 0.264+0.033
−0.020 [5],
from a measurement of the lifetime of the ground state of ∼ 2 fs. More data from
the experiment is presently being analyzed to bring down the uncertainties.

Pion-pion scattering has long occupied the attention of theorists even before

2

the advent of QCD. The reason for this was that it provided a paradise for the-
oreticians due to the simplicity of the process, and the possibility of deploying
many powerful theoretical constraints that follow from general principles. No-
table amongst these was the application of dispersion relations, relations which
follow from the principle of causality in ﬁeld theory. Loosely speaking disper-
sion relations arise from the application of Cauchy’s theory of complex variable
theory to scattering amplitudes, when the latter are considered as complex
functions of complex energy arguments. Other principles go under the names
of ‘crossing symmetry’ and unitarity.
In the context of pion-pion scattering
a system of dispersion relations were established that entailed the presence of
certain unknown functions of the momentum transfer which limited the power
of the dispersion relations. In an extraordinary feat in 1971, S. M. Roy used all
the general properties of scattering amplitudes to eliminate all these problems,
and gave a representation that required the knowledge of the two scattering
lengths only, in addition to the knowledge only of the imaginary parts of the
partial waves [6]. This further led to a system of coupled integral equations for
all the partial waves of pion-pion scattering. However, partial knowledge of the
low-lying waves and some theoretical models of the higher waves could be used
to produce a determination of pion scattering lengths. This program to pin
down pion scattering phase shifts came to be known as Roy equation analysis.
The analysis of phase shift information provided by the rare Kl4 decay and Roy
equation analysis was used to pin down a0
0 to the range 0.26 ± 0.05 based on 30,
000 events from the Geneval-Saclay experiment [7], when activity in the ﬁeld
stopped for a couple of decades.

After the advent of QCD and the subsequent development of low energy
eﬀective theories for pion-pion scattering there was a resurgence of interest in
the subject. These eﬀective theories exploit the symmetry properties of the
strong interactions to provide a consistent framework as an expansion in powers
of momenta and the quark masses has come to be known as chiral perturbation
theory, and is identiﬁed with the work of J. Gasser and H. Leutwyler [8]. At
leading order in the low-energy expansion, S. Weinberg gave a prediction for a0
0
of 0.16 [9], while at next to leading order the number was revised to 0.20 ± 0.01,
which resulted from the comprehensive analysis by Gasser and Leutwyler. The
presence of light particles in the spectrum was the culprit for this substatial
revision. The revision was found to stay stable at next to next to leading order,
for a thorough discussion, see, e.g.
ref [10]. Debates were sparked on what
exactly was nature of the QCD ground state which would protect this predic-
tion; deviations from conventionally accepted picture of spontaneous symmetry
breaking due to which pions themselves arise as near massless states were pro-
posed. Such scenarios would have predicted higher values of a0
0 [11]. We note
here that a comprehensive Roy equation analysis tailored to meet the needs of
modern eﬀective ﬁeld theories was recently presented, see ref. [12].

These dispersion relations are suﬃciently general to permit an extension
into the complex energy plane. Typically, the existence of singularities known

3

as poles on the second Riemann sheet represents the formation of bound states
of quarks and anti-quarks, and imply the formation of an intermediate unstable
particle. From the real and imaginary parts of the pole position one may deduce
the mass of this new particle and its ‘width’ which is related to the inverse
lifetime of the particle. Recently, using the properties above, along with the
accurately known solutions of the Roy equations the pole position of the state
known as σ has been determined to high accuracy in the pion-pion I = 0
channel. Note that this is a model independent way of establishing of what is
the lowest-lying state in the strong interaction spectrum [13]. The mass and
width are respectively given as Mσ = 441+16
−18 MeV.
Special attention may be paid to the small uncertainties.

−6 MeV and Γσ = 544+25

An extension of the study to a more complicated process that involves the
scattering of pions and kaons has also been carried but due to paucity of ex-
perimental data is yet to see the spectacular success of pion-pion scattering.
Here the comparison of dispersion relations and chiral perturbation theory has
been performed in ref. [14]. A modern Roy-Steiner analysis, the analog of pion-
pion scattering Roy equation analysis was recently provided in ref. [15]. On
the experimental side, there is a proposal to produce πK atoms, while there is
possibility of measurement of certain phase shift information at the COMPASS
experiment. Much work remains to be done. However, the position of the κ-
resonance has also been recently determined [16], using the principles analogous
to those that were described in the pion-pion case earlier, using the accurately
known solutions to the Roy-Steiner system.

There are studies on the lattice of scattering lengths and these have been

reviewed in ref. [17] and is beyond the scope of the present article.

To summarize, we have pointed out the results emanating from a series of
beautiful new experiments, and shown the conﬂuence of theory and experiment.
The theory uses eﬀective ﬁeld theories, dispersion relations, and together they
make possible precise predictions in a domain long considered too inhospitable
for such a state of aﬀairs.

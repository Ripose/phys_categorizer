Abstract

We show that any second order linear ordinary diﬀrential equation
with constant coeﬃcients (including the damped and undumped har-
monic oscillator equation) admits an exact discretization, i.e., there
exists a diﬀerence equation whose solutions exactly coincide with solu-
tions of the corresponding diﬀerential equation evaluated at a discrete
sequence of points (a lattice). Such exact discretization is found for
an arbitrary lattice spacing.

1 Introduction

The motivation for writing this paper is an observation that small and ap-
parently not very important changes in the discretization of a diﬀerential
equation lead to diﬀerence equations with completely diﬀerent properties.

By the discretization we mean a simulation of the diﬀerential equation by a
diﬀerence equation [1].

In this paper we consider the damped harmonic oscillator equation

¨x + 2γ ˙x + ω2

0x = 0 .

(1)

where x = x(t) and the dot means the t-derivative. This is a linear equation
and its general solution is well known. Therefore discretization procedures
are not so important (but sometimes are applied, see [2]). However, this
example allows us to show and illustrate some more general ideas.

The most natural discretization, known as the Euler method (Appendix B,
˙x by the diﬀerence ratio

compare [1, 3]) consists in replacing x by xn,
(xn+1

xn)/ε, ¨x by the diﬀerence ratio of diﬀerence ratios, i.e.,

and so on. This possibility is not unique. We can replace, for instance, x by
2xn + xn−1)/ε2. Actually the
xn+1, or ˙x by (xn −
last formula, due to its symmetry, seems to be more natural than (2) (and it
works better indeed, see Section 2).

In any case we demand that the continuum limit, i.e.,

(3)

applied to any discretization of a diﬀerential equation yields this diﬀerential
equation. The continuum limit consists in replacing xn by x(tn) = x(t)
and the neighbouring values are computed from the Taylor expansion of the
function x(t) at t = tn

xn+k = x(tn + kε) = x(tn) + ˙x(tn)kε +

¨x(tn)k2ε2 + . . .

Substituting these expansions into the diﬀerence equation and leaving only
the leading term we should obtain the considered diﬀerential equation.

In this paper we compare various discretizations of the damped (and
undamped) harmonic oscillator equation. The main result of the present
paper consists in ﬁnding the exact discretization of the damped harmonic
oscillator equation (1). By exact discretization we mean that xn = x(tn)
holds for any ε and not only in the limit (3).

2 Simplest discretizations of the harmonic os-

cillator

Let us consider the following three discrete equations

xn+1

−

2xn + xn−1
ε2

xn+1

−

2xn + xn−1
ε2

xn+1

−

2xn + xn−1
ε2

+ xn−1 = 0 ,

+ xn = 0 ,

+ xn+1 = 0 ,

where ε is a constant. The continuum limit (3) yields, in any of these cases,
the harmonic oscillator equation

¨x + x = 0 .

To ﬁx our attention, in this paper we consider only solutions correspond-
ing to the initial conditions x(0) = 0,
˙x(0) = 1. The initial data for the
discretizations are chosen in the simplest form: we assume that x0 and x1
belong to the graph of the exact continuous solution.

For small tn and small ε the discrete solutions of any of these equations
approximate the corresponding continuous solution quite well (see Fig. 1).
However, the global behaviours of the solutions (still for small ε!) are diﬀerent
(see Fig. 2). The solution of the equation (6) vanishes at t
while the
solution of (4) oscillates with rapidly incrising amplitude (all black points
are outside the range of Fig. 2). Qualitatively, only the discretization (5)
resembles the continuous case. However, for very large t the discrete solution
becomes increasingly diﬀerent from the exact continuous solution even in the
case (5) (compare Fig. 2 and Fig. 3).

→ ∞

The natural question arises how to ﬁnd a discretization which is the best

as far as global properties of solutions are concerned.

In this paper we will show how to ﬁnd the “exact” discretization of the
damped harmonic oscillator equation.
In particular, we will present the
discretization of (7) which is better than (5) and, in fact, seems to be the best
possible. We begin, however, with a very simple example which illustrates
the general idea of this paper quite well.

3 The exact discretization of the exponential

growth equation

We consider the discretization of the equation ˙x = x. Its general solution
reads

The simplest discretization is given by

x(t) = x(0)et .

xn

xn+1
−
ε

= xn .

xn = (1 + ε)nx0 .

This discrete equation can be solved immediately. Actually this is just the
geometric sequence xn+1 = (1 + ε)xn. Therefore

To compare with the continuous case we write (1 + ε)n in the form

(1 + ε)n = exp(n ln(1 + ε)) = exp(κtn) ,

(11)
where tn := εn and κ := ε−1 ln(1+ε). Thus the solution (10) can be rewritten
as

= 1 the continuous solution (8), evaluated at tn,

xn = x0eκtn .

Therefore we see that for κ
i.e.

x(tn) = x(0)etn ,

diﬀers from the corresponding discrete solution (12). One can easily see that
0 < κ < 1. Only in the limit ε

0 we have κ
Although the qualitative behaviour of the “naive” simulation (9) is in
good agreement with the smooth solutions (exponential growth in both cases)
but quantitatively the discrepancy is very large for t
because the
exponents are diﬀerent.

The discretization (9) can be easily improved. Indeed, replacing in the
formula (10) 1 + ε by eε we obtain that (10) coincides with the exact solution
(13). This “exact discretization” is given by:

4 Discretizations of the harmonic oscillator:

exact solutions

The general solution of the harmonic oscillator equation (7) is well known

x(t) = x(0) cos t + ˙x(0) sin t .

(15)

In Section 2 we compared graphically this solution with the simplest discrete
simulations: (4), (5), (6). Now we are going to present exact solutions of
these discrete equations.

Because the discrete case is usually less known than the continuous one
we recall shortly that the simplest approach consists in searching solutions
in the form xn = Λn (this is an analogue of the ansatz x(t) = exp(λt) made
in the continuous case, for more details see Appendix A). As a result we get
the characteristic equation for Λ.

We illustrate this approach on the example of the equation (4) resulting
from the Euler method. Substituting xn = Λn we get the following charac-
teristic equation

with solutions Λ1 = 1 + iε, Λ2 = 1

iε. The general solution of (4) reads

2Λ + (1 + ε2) = 0 ,

xn = c1Λn

One can check that κ > 0 and ω < 1 for any ε > 0. For ε
0 we have

1. Therefore the discrete solution (20) is characterized by the
exponential growth of the envelope amplitude and a smaller frequency of
oscillations than the corresponding continuous solution (15).

→

→

→

A similar situation is in the case (6), with only one (but very important)
diﬀerence: instead of the growth we have the exponential decay. The formulas
(19) and (20) need only one correction to be valid in this case. Namely, κ
has to be changed to

κ.

The third case, (5), is characterized by ρ = 1, and, therefore, the ampli-
tude of the oscillations is constant (this case will be discussed below in more
detail).

These results are in perfect agreement with the behaviour of the solutions

of discrete equations illustrated at Fig. 1 and Fig. 2.

Let us consider the following family of discrete equations (parameterized

by real parameters p, q):

xn+1

2xn + xn−1

The continuum limit (3) applied to (21) yields the harmonic oscillator (7) for
any p, q. The family (21) contains all three examples of Section 2 and (for
p = q = 1/4) the equation resulting from the Gauss-Legendre-Runge-Kutta
method (see Appendix B):

Substituting xn = Λn into (21) we get the following characteristic equation:

(2 + (p + q

1)ε2)Λ + (1 + pε2) = 0

We formulate the following problem: ﬁnd a discrete equation in the family
(21) with the global behaviour of solutions as much similar to the continuous
case as possible.

At least two conditions seem to be very natural in order to get a “good”
discretization of the harmonic oscillator: oscillatory character and a constant
amplitude of the solutions (i.e., ρ = 1, κ = 0). These conditions can be easily

the roots should be imaginary (i.e., ∆ < 0), second, their modulus should be
equal to 1 i.e., Λ1 = eiα, Λ2 = e−iα. Therefore 1 + pε2 = 1 + qε2, i.e., q = p.

The equation (5) is a special case of (21) for q = p = 0. As we have seen
in Section 2, for small ε this discretization simulates the harmonic oscillator
(7) much better than (4) or (6). However, for suﬃciently large ε (namely,
ε > 2) the properties of this discretization change dramatically. Its generic
solution grows exponentially without oscillations.

The standard numerical methods give similar results (in all cases pre-
sented in Appendix B the discretization of the second derivative is the sim-
plest one, the same as described in our Introduction). The corresponding
discrete equations do not simulate (7) better than the discretizations pre-
sented in Section 2.

cretization

Let us consider the damped harmonic oscillator equation (1). Its general
solution can be expressed by the roots λ1, λ2 of the characteristic equation
λ2 + 2γλ + ω2

To obtain some simple discretization of (1) we should replace the ﬁrst deriva-
tive and the second derivative by discrete analogues. The results of Section 2
suggest that the best way to discretize the second derivative is the symmetric
one, like in Eq. (5). There are at least 3 possibilities for the discretization
of the ﬁrst derivative leading to the following simulations of the damped
harmonic oscillator equation:

6 The exact discretization of the damped har-

monic oscillator equation

In order to ﬁnd the exact discretization of (1) we consider the general linear
discrete equation of second order

xn+2 = 2Axn+1 + Bxn .

The general solution of (33) has the following closed form (compare Ap-
pendix A):

xn =

xn = (1

−

Is it possible to identify xn given by (34) with x(tn) where x(t) is given

by (28)?

Yes! It is suﬃcient to express in an appropriate way λ1 and λ2 by Λ1 and
Λ2 and also the initial conditions x(0), ˙x(0) by x0, x1. It is quite surprising
that the above identiﬁcation can be done for any ε.

The crucial point consists in setting

Λn

k = exp(n ln Λk)) = exp(tnλk) ,

where, as usual, tn := nε. It means that

λk := ε−1 ln Λk ,

(note that for imaginary Λk, say Λk = ρkeiαk , we have ln Λk = ln ρk + iαk).
Then (34) assumes the form

The degenerate case, Λ1 = Λ2 (which is equivalent to λ1 = λ2) can be
considered analogically (compare Appendix A). The formula (36) is obtained
Λ1. Therefore all formulas for the degenerate
from (34) in the limit Λ2
case can be derived simply by taking the limit λ2

λ1.

Thus we have a one-to-one correspondence between second order diﬀeren-
tial equations with constant coeﬃcients and second order discrete equations
with constant coeﬃcients. This correspondence, referred to as the exact dis-
cretization, is induced by the relation (38) between the eigenvalues of the
associated characteristic equations.

(2) and (5)) but ε appearing in the discretization of the second derivative is
replaced by 2 sin(ε/2). For small ε we have 2 sin(ε/2)

ε.

The comparison of the exact discretization (45) with three other discrete
equations simulating the harmonic oscillator is done in Fig. 3, and in Fig. 4.
We point out that the considered simulations are very good indeed (although
t in Fig 3 is very large) but they cannot be better than the exact discretiza-
2xn in
tion. The discretization (27) is also excellent. The coeﬃcient by

made in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, the discretization (27) practically cannot be dis-
cerned from the exact one.

7 Conclusions

In this paper we have shown that for linear ordinary diﬀerential equations
of second order with constant coeﬃcients there exists a discretization which
is “exact” and simulates properly all features of the diﬀerential equation.
The solutions of this discrete equation exactly coincide with solutions of the
corresponding diﬀerential equation evaluated at a discrete lattice. Such exact
discretization can be found for an arbitrary lattice spacing ε.

Therefore we conclude that in this case diﬀerential and diﬀerence equa-
tions are in one-to-one correspondence: to any linear diﬀerential equation

18

with constant coeﬃcients there corresponds a diﬀerence equation which we
call the exact discretization.

Analogical considerations can be made for linear ordinary diﬀerential
equations (with constant coeﬃcients) of any order (the details will be pre-
sented elsewhere).

We point out that to achieve our goal we had to assume an essential de-
pendence of the discretization on the considered equation, in contrast to the
standard numerical approach to ordinary diﬀerential equations where prac-
tically no assumptions are imposed on the considered system (i.e., universal
methods, applicable for any equation, are considered) [4].

In the last years one can observe the development of the numerical meth-
ods which are applicable for some clases of equations (e.g., admitting Hamil-
tonian formulation) but are much more powerful (especially when global or
qualitative aspects are considered) [5, 6].

“Recent years have seen a shift in paradigm away from classical consider-
ations which motivated the construction of numerical methods for ordinary
diﬀerential equations. Traditionally the focus has been on the stability of dif-
ference schemes for dissipative systems on compact time intervals. Modern
research is instead shifting in emphasis towards the preservation of invariants
and the reproduction of correct qualitative features” [7].

In our paper we have a kind of extremal situation: the method is ap-
plicable for a very narrow class of equations but as a result we obtain the
discretization which seems to be surprisingly good.

Similar situation occurs for the integrable (soliton) nonlinear systems. It
is believed (and proved for a very large class of equations) that integrable
equations admit integrable discretizations which preserve the unique features
of these equations (inﬁnite number of conservation laws, solitons, transfor-
mations generating explicit solutions etc.) [8, 9].

The exact discretization considered in this paper is the best possible simu-
lation of a diﬀerential equation. Linear ordinary diﬀerential equations always
admit the unique exact discretization. An open problem is to ﬁnd such dis-
cretization for some other classes of diﬀerential equations.

A Linear diﬀerence equations with constant

We recall a method of solving diﬀerence equations with constant coeﬁcients.
It consists in representing the equation in the form of a matrix equation of
the ﬁrst order. The general linear discrete equation of the second order

(47)

(48)

(49)

(50)

(51)

xn+2 = 2Axn+1 + Bxn ,

can be rewritten in the matrix form as follows

yn+1 = Myn ,

where

yn =

xn+1
xn !

,

 

M =

2A B
1

0 !

.

 

The general solution of (48) has, obviously, the following form:

yn = M ny0

and the solution of a diﬀerence equation is reduced to the purely algebraic
problem of computing powers of a given matrix.

The same procedure can be applied for any linear diﬀerence equation
with constant coeﬃcients. If the diﬀerence equation is of m-th order, then
to obtain the equation (48) we deﬁne

yn := (xn+m, xm+m−1, . . . , xn+1, xn)T

where the superscript T means the transposition.

The power M n can be easily computed in the generic case in which the

matrix M can be diagonalized, i.e., represented in the form

M = NDN −1 ,

where D is a diagonal matrix. Then, obviously, M n = NDnN −1. The
diagonalization is possible whenever the matrix M has exactly m linearly
independent eigenvectors (in particular, if the characteristic equation (52)
has m pairwise diﬀerent roots). Then the columns of the matrix N are

20

just the eigenvectors of M, and the diagonal diagonal coeﬃcients of D are
eigenvalues of M.

The characteristic equation (det(M

λI) = 0) for m = 2 (i.e., for (47))

−

has the form
Λ2

B = 0 .

Its roots will be denoted by Λ1, Λ2 (see (35)). If Λ1
ization procedure yields

= Λ2, then the diagonal-

where the columns of N are the eigenvectors of M, i.e.,

N =

and performing the multiplication we get (34).

The case of multiple eigenvalues of M is technically more complicated.
In order to compute M n we can, for instance, transform M to the Jordan
canonical form (see, for instance, [10]). Here we suggest a method which is
very eﬃcient for 2
2 matrices. By the Cayley-Hamilton theorem ([10]) any
matrix satisﬁes its characteristic equation. In the case of (47) it means that
M 2 = 2AλM + B. In the case of the double root (B =
A2) one can easily
prove by induction

M n = (1

n)AnM + nAn−1 .

Substituting it to (48) we get immediately (36).

B Numerical methods for ordinary diﬀeren-

tial equations

In this short note we give basic informations about some numerical methods
for ordinary diﬀerential equations and we appply them to case of harmonic
oscillator equation (7).

A system of linear ordinary diﬀerential equations (of any order) can al-

ways be rewritten as a single matrix equation of the ﬁrst order:

where the unknown y is a vector and S is a given matrix (in general t-
dependent). Numerical methods are almost always (see [4]) constructed for
a large class of ordinary diﬀerential equations (including nonlinear ones):

˙y = Sy ,

˙y = f (t, y) .

We denote by yn a numerical approximant to the exact solution y(tn).

Euler’s method

yk+1 = yk + εf (tk, yk)

In this case the discretization of ¨x + x = 0 is given by (4).

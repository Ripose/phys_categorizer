Abstract

Problems concerning with application of quantum rules on classical
phenomena have been widely studied, for which lifted up the idea
about quantization and uncertainty principle. Energy quantization
on classical example of simple harmonic oscillator has been reviewed
in this paper.

1 Introduction

In the past few years applications of quantum rules on many classical prob-
lems have been widely studied, both theoretically and experimentally[1-3].
Such applications lifted up problems concerning with quantization and the
uncertainty principle, which are not considered in the classical scheme. These
treatments are of considerable importance these days owing to their prospec-
tive applications or even more establish a new ﬁeld, for example, in quantum
computation and quantum cryptography[4-6].

How can we realize classical problems in quantum scheme? Let us con-
sider a simple one-dimensional classical harmonic oscillator of mass m with
kinetic energy p2/2m and potential energy kq2/2 = mω2q2/2, where k is a
constant. Thus, it leads to the corresponding Hamiltonian

has oscillating solutions A sin(ωt) + B cos(ωt), with ω = (k/m)1/2 being the
angular frequency of vibration, which allow us to rewrite the Hamiltonian

2 Quantum Simple Harmonic Oscillator

2.1 The energy quantization

Let us use the quantum theory to the simple one-dimensional classical har-
monic oscillator we have introduced above. In the quantum case we substi-
tute the potential energy equation kq2/2 into Eq. (4) to obtain

d2u
dz2 + (2ǫ − z2)u = 0

. . . (6).

where

z = (

mω
¯h

)1/2q

and

ǫ =

. . . (7).

E
¯hω

As ussual, one expects solutions of Eq.

(6) to show rapid decline as
z2 ≫ ǫ, show
z → ±∞. Our inspection of the asymptotic form,
u ∼ exp(−z2/2) is a solution in this region. This therefore suggest general
solutions of the form F (z)exp(−z2/2), where F is a polynomial. Substituting
this form into Eq. (6) yields

i.e.

d2F
dz2 − 2z

dF
dz

+ (2ǫ − 1)F = 0

. . . (8).

Suppose the leading term of F is zn. This contributes

n(n − 1)zn−2 − 2nzn + (2ǫ − 1)zn

. . . (9).

to the left-hand side of Eq. (8). The coeﬃcient of zn must vanish to comply
with Eq. (8) and as lower-order terms in the polynomial F only contribute
to zn−1, or lower powers, we demand from Eq. (9) that

ǫ = n +

n = 1, 2, 3, . . .

. . . (10).

It follows from Eq. (7) that the energy E is restricted to discrete levels

given by

En = (n +

)¯hω

. . . (11).

These levels have the interesting property that they are equispaced and the
classical frequency ω is related to E in the same way as the photon relation,
E = hν. This is no coincidence.

We have showed that the energy of quantum oscillator is quantized. The
ground state, however, has energy 1
2¯hω which, as in previous example, is
above the classical minimum (E = 0). The ground state wave function u0 is
given by n = 0 in which case F is constant, so u0 ∝ exp(−z2/2). Applying
the normalization condition gives a gaussian function

u0 = (mω/π¯h)1/4exp(−mωq2/2¯h)

. . . (12).

The expectation values of q and V for the ground state are

2.2 Further disscusion on quantization

We can see that the Hamiltonian formulation in Eq. (1) take the form of the
left-hand side of Eq. (4) by cancelled the u(q) and inserting V = 1
2kq2. By
putting the wave function ψ instead of u(q) and write E as i¯h ∂
∂t we have the
Schr¨odinger equation in the form

By scalling the oscillator by introducing s = q/q0 and q2
Schr¨odinger equation in terms of s for the wave function ψ(s, t)

0 = ¯h/mω yields the

The ¯h may now be cancelled remaining only one parameter ω to deﬁne the
oscillator. This scalling allow us to ﬁnd the eigenfunctions for stationary
states which satisfy

Eψ = ¯hω(−

We have already seen that the spectrum is discrete (Eq. (11)), and that
2 s2) and the other factor

the ﬁrst few eigenfuctions all contain a factor exp(− 1
being a polynomial. We can setting

ψ = f (s)exp(−

by diﬀerentiation we have

ψ′′ = (f ′′ − 2sf ′ + (s2 − 1)f )exp(−

Inserting in the original equation now gives the equation for f,

Ef = ¯hω(−

f ′′ + sf ′ +

f )

. . . (20).

We may now solve the problem using the power series approach. We see
that none of terms is singular for any value for s, so we may expand f as a
Taylor series which convergent for all s,

f (s) =

. . . (21).

Xj=0

Substitute in the equation and collecting powers of sj in the result gives

Ecj = ¯hω{−

¯hω(j + 2)(j + 1)cj+2 = {(j +

(j ≥ 0)

. . . (23).

We see that if we know c0 and c1, any subsequaent coeﬃcient may be obtained
by applying this relation a suﬃcient number of times. It remains ensure that
ψ(s) → 0 as |s| → ∞.

Now we have for large j

j

. . . (24).

we can see that the coeﬃcients show a behaviour similar to those in the Taylor
series of exp s2. Consequently, ψ(≡ f exp(− 1
2 s2)) is inevitably unbounded
as s goes to inﬁnity in either direction, and this will not do. The series for f
must therefore terminate and this happens only if

E = En ≡ (n +

malized function including their time dependence as given bellow,

2.3 The algebraic formulation of the simple harmonic

We shall carry out the solution of the simple harmonic oscillator using an al-
gebraic formalism based on the Dirac notation. The starting point is the fact
that the Hamiltonian is almost factorizable as the diﬀerence of two squares,

(s −

)(s +

)ψ(s) = (s2 −

We shall introduce the s-representation by writing ψ(s) = hs|ψi and deﬁne

two operators a, a+ by the relations

hs|a = 2−1/2(s +

. . . (28).

hs|a+ = 2−1/2(s −

which show us about the quantization on the energy of the oscillator.

2.4 The Wilson-Sommerfeld rules of quantization

This rules discovered by W. Wilson and A. Sommerfeld independently in
1915[7]. This method consists in solving the classical equation of motion
in the Hamiltonian form, therefore applying the coordinates q1, . . . , q3n and
the canonically conjugate momenta p1, . . . , p3n as the independent variables.
The assumption is the introduced that only those classical orbits are allowed
as stasionary states for which the following condition are satisﬁed,

pk dqk = nkh,

k = 1, 2, . . . , 3n

nk = an integer

. . . (32).

I

This integrals can be calculated only for conditionally periodic systems,
i.e. for systems for which coordinates can be found each of which goes through
a cycle as a function of the time, independently of the others. Sometimes the
coordinates can be chosen in several diﬀerent ways, in which case the shapes
of the quantized orbits depend on the choice of coordinate systems, but the
energy values do not.

3 Concluding Remark

It follows from Eq. (14) and the followed description that the expectation
value of the kinetic energy hE0i − hV i is 1
2 E0 also. As in the classical case,

8

the average kinetic and potential energies are the same. This remains true
for the excited levels (n ≥ 1). We could construct such levels wave function
by substitute a full polynomial for F in Eq. (8) and equate the coeﬃcients
of all the powers (not just zn) to zero.

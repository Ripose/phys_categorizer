Abstract
An original method, assuming potential and kinetic energy for prices and
conservation of their sum is developed for forecasting exchanges. Connections
with power law are shown. Semiempirical applications on S&P500, DJIA,
and NASDAQ predict a coming recession in them. An emerging market,
Istanbul Stock Exchange index ISE-100 is found involving a potential to
continue to rise.

Keywords: Potential and kinetic energy; Equations of motion; Power law;

Oscillations; Crashes; Portfolio growths

PACS numbers: 89.65.Gh
1. Introduction
As is well known, prices, market indices evolve from one mood to another
in time. They may be in calm oscillatory ﬂuctuation mood for some time,
then they may increase (or decrease), then again turn into a new oscillatory
period, then a crash or a crisis may come, and ﬁnally, the current era closes
up. Then a new one takes stage; new conditions and new formations take
place, so forth ad inﬁnitum. The time terms between long range drastic
changes are named as era in the present work, and comparatively medium
or short range characteristic time periods in eras are cited as epoch. The
whole past and future history of exchanges may be far from obeying analyt-
ical functions. Time series may be predicted epoch by epoch, as presently
proposed, in terms of some simple analytical functions. These equations of
motion for prices are derived in the next section and power law connections
are displayed in the third one. In the fourth section three indices S&P500,
DJIA, and NASDAQ from New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and ISE-100
from Istanbul Stock Exchange (ISE) are predicted by the present method.
Last section is devoted to conclusion.

2. Potential and kinetic energies and conservation of their sum
A potential energy (taking mass as unity, see N OT E 1) in terms of diﬀerence

in prices (χ = χ(t)) may be deﬁned as
U(χ – χav) = h (χ – χav)α , (1)

where h and α are some price independent parameters designating the cur-
rent epoch, and χav is some time average of prices, which deﬁnes the zero-
potential-level. Eq.
(1) describes a kind of “gravitational” potential (as
on the earth surface) for α=1, where h becomes the gravitational (anti-
gravitational) constant (g) with 0¡h=g (0¿h=–g). Whereas for α=2 we have
a spring-mass potential energy with a spring constant (Hooke constant) equal
to 2h. It is worth to underline that, the parameters of Eq. (1) i.e., h, α, and
χav may diﬀer from one epoch to the other for any share and also from one
share to another in any epoch. Note that, potential energy in Eq. (1) satisﬁes
a power law for any α, as discussed to some extend in the next section.

Moreover, again by taking mass as unity, one may deﬁne kinetic energy

for prices as

K = 1/2v2 , (2)

where v is the usual speed i.e., v(t)=dχ(t)/dt. The dimensional unit of
K may be taken as (local currency unit/time)2 for shares, e.g., (6 c/day)2
or ($/day)2in USA. For indices lcu may be kept in the units or it may be
(1) will obviously have
substituted by “value”. Potential energy of Eq.
the same unit as (lcu/time)2, and for α=1 the factor h will have the unit
(lcu/time2), where lcu stands for local currency unit. For α=2, h will have
the unit of (time–2) i.e., frequency squared.

We may assume conservation of the sum of potential and kinetic energies,

as long as friction forces, damping etc. are negligible,
U + K = h(χ – χav)α + 1/2v2 = E = constant . (3)
Diﬀerentiation of Eq. (3) with respect to time, for α=1 yields

h(dχ/dt) + v(dv/dt) = 0 , (4)
from which, after substituting v=dχ/dt and a=dv/dt, one may obtain the
familiar equation of motion for azimuthal rises and falls as in classical me-
chanics

1N OT E Some kind of inertia as “resistance” against any impact to move the price do
exist in time charts of shares.[1-4, and references therein]. Yet, not any reasonable “force
equation” connecting inertia and accelaration of stock prices is proposed. In any case,
whether massless potential and kinetic energies are deﬁned, or they are deﬁned per mass,
or even mass is taken as unity in them will not be worth much in the present scheme.

χ(tm) = χ0 + v0 tm + 1/2 h t2

m , (5 )

where χ0, and v0 designate initial price and speed, respectively. Time tm
runs over exchange process days and may be set to zero at the beginning
of any epoch. For α=2, Eq.
In the expansion of
χav(tm) = χav(tm=0)+vavtm sign and magnitude of vav indicates the up,
down or horizontal character of oscillatory trends;

/2),
where A, w, and Φ is the usual amplitude, angular frequency (here, (2h)
and phase, respectively. They are observed in general to have some medium
range time periods about some ten days or so, and fade away after a few
(two, or three) full periods.

3. Potential energy, power law, and log-periodic equations of

motion

The form of potential energy in Eq. (1) satisﬁes a power law, which is
known in physics for a long time as eﬀective subject, utilized especially to
express critical phenomena in statistical mechanics. Some special forms of
power law appears outside the physical ﬁelds as Pareto’s Law and Zipf’s
Law.[6, 7]. It is also utilized in seismic predictions for the rupture times.[8,
9]

Power law states that if the argument x of any observable O(x) is scaled
by some λ, (i.e., if x′/x=λ) and if O(x′)/O(x)=ζ, then O(x)=xα is a solution
with λα = ζ and α=logζ/logλ. Note that, λ and ζ are independent of x
and the relative value of the observable at two diﬀerent scales depend only
on the ratio of the scaling parameters. This is the way scale invariance
is associated to self-similarity and criticality. Note also that there is no
condition on α to be real. Incorporating λα/ζ=1=exp(i2πm)[10, 11], where
m is any integer, one may generalize the standard scaling O(x)=xα to a
log-periodic one, O(x)=xαP(logx/logλ), where P is a function of period 1.
Fourier expansion of P can be performed to obtain the most general form of
the relevant function. (For detailed and complete treatment, and for various
applications see [8-31].) For the sake of simplicity, one may take into account
only the ﬁrst Fourier term;

O(τ ) ≈ (1–τ )α{d0 + d1cos[2πΩln(1–τ ) + Ψ]} , (7)

where, τ stands for t/Tc and t is the general independent time variable, and
Tc is the crtitical time; α=lnζ/lnλ, Ω= 1/lnλ, and Ψn is some general phase
term. What is in Eq. (7) relevant to time series of shares and indices is that,
near the crash (which is considered as a failure time for the log-periodicity)

3

the frequency of the oscillations and the volatility increases, which can be
considered as one of the hall-marks of the coming crash.

Let’s approximate the (1–τ )α factor and ln(1-τ ) by (1–ατ ) and (-τ ) for
τ ∼=0, i.e. much before (and by t → –t, much after) the critical time. After
some simple mathematical manipulations Eq. (7) can be written as

O(τ ) ≈ D0 + D1τ + D2cos(2πΩτ + Ψ′) , (8)

where, the constants D0, D1, D2 can be calculated out of d0, d1,and the others
of Eq. (7). Close similarity between Eqs. (8) and (6) is a consequence of Eq.
(1) obeying power law.
4. Applications
The three NYSE indices S&P500, DJIA, and NASDAQ[33] are extensively
studied in literature especially within the formalism of power law. For similar
log-periodic predictions performed on ISE-100[34] see [27].
In all of these
indices (as in many other world markets) a severe crash dated about the year
of 2000 is common. The present state of the same indices will be investigated
utilizing the original method of stock mechanics.

The index of S&P500
A crucial feature in S&P500 (Fig. 1) is the almost symmetric behavior
of time series about the critical point near 01.Sept.2000 with the close value
of 1520.77. Secondly, starting with the beginning of 1995, oscillatory periods
decrease as closes climb to the climax. Afterwards closes start to recede and
high frequency oscillations turn back into low frequency ones with increasing
amplitudes. Thirdly, with the linear price axis, the time series may be ﬁtted
as a ﬁrst order approximation by partial straight lines. Then simple analyti-
cal functions may be utilized for each epoch (j=1, 2, 3, 4) as χj(tm) = χ0j +
vjtm, corresponding to a constant potential energy, i.e. α=0, and h arbitrary
in Eq. (1). In this picture the 1987, 1990, 1998 crashes do seem as normal
ﬂuctuations, as well as the others after 2000.

For α=1 in Eq. (1), the second order expression of Eq. (5) delivers very
interesting results for the two epochs; one from the beginning of 1997 to
the end of 2002, and the second after 2002 till the present time (May.2005),
see Fig. 1. By a simple least square ﬁt (lsf) to daily data[33], the gravity
comes about the same for both of the pronounced epochs as h = – 0.001101
lcu/day2. The initial (shooting) speed is found to be 1.73 lcu/day for the ﬁrst
epoch and 1.11 lcu/day for the next one. Imagining the close values as height
of a particle shot up in the given gravitational ﬁeld; the particle ﬁrst rises
till the climax, then falls down and hits the ground at an elevation of 663
lcu. Afterwards it bounces back with a smaller speed and rises till a lesser

4

height of 1219 lcu. Therefore, during the collision it looses its total energy
by 59% and the collision is inelastic. The maximum height in any epoch can
be calculated utilizing the relation χ – χ0 = v2
0/(2h). It is worth to forecast
that March.2005 values are local maximum for S&P500, and a recessional
correction may be expected till the level of 800 back, within the coming 500
days. The pronounced parameters are listed in Table 1 for S&P500 as well
as for the other indices.
The index of DJIA
DJIA has similar features as pronounced above for S&P500, see Fig. 2.
Focusing on quadratic behavior (Eq. 5), gravity again comes out as common
for both of the token epochs, before and after the beginning of 2003 (Fig. 2.),
where h = – 0.00606 lcu/day2. Hitting speed is 10.17 lcu/day, and bouncing
back speed is 8.43 lcu/day, corresponding to 31% loss in total energy. So
the March.2005 height is considerably close the historical top of Jan.2000.
Again, in about 500 days, DJIA is forecasted to recede back to 8000’s.

The index of NASDAQ
Nasdaq has the most complicated appearance of all the NYSE indices
studied here. Yet, it displays very many similarities with S&P500 and DJIA,
Fig. 3. Moreover a common gravity comes out for the two epochs following
the beginning of 1997 and separated by the beginning of 2003 (Fig. 3.), where
h= – 0.0041 lcu/day2. The hitting and bouncing back speeds are 6.08 lcu/day
and 3.10 lcu/day, respectively. Then, the loss in total energy is 75%. So, as
expected, the March.2005 heights are quite below the historical maximum.
Consecutively, NASDAQ is also forecasted to recede back to 1400’s at least,
within the next one and a half year.

The index of ISE-100
ISE is a well known world emerging market, and comparing to the NYSE
indices, ISE-100 has many more diﬀerent aspects than similar ones. A log-
linear era (lasting about 20 years from the beginning on) has closed by the
2000 crash. Afterwards a recession with 30% loss in a year has taken place.
Between Jan.2000 and Jan.2004, recession epoch has been completed and
transition to a new up trend has already taken place.

Within the pronounced epoch, ISE-100 displays a dishlike form, and as
can be seen in Fig. 4. a. there exist anti-gravity with h= 0.001811 lcu/day2.
The work done by this constant anti-gravity results in increasing the total
energy, day by day. So, one may expect ISE-100 to continue to rise with
some possible decorative up and down ﬂuctuations. It is hard to forecast the
time of departure from Eq. (5) and solid curve in Fig. 4. a.; yet, it seems

5

that it lies in the far future.

On the other hand, it can be observed that, at the bottom of the Jan.2000
and Jan.2004 epoch, the trend is horizontal. Meanwhile, many oscillations
of type Eqs. (6) and (8) may be expected to exist in ISE-100 and in many
ISE shares. In Figs. 4. b. and 4. c., two typical oscillatory epochs with
diﬀerent time domains are exempliﬁed, where time axis is weekly and daily,
respectively. The corresponding mechanical parameters are listed in Table
2. For better ﬁts one may take into account many coupled smaller spring-
masses.

5. Conclusion
The present analytical method can be applied to shares as well. In general
there exists a wide diversity of epochs in world markets, in which the present
analytical functions can safely be applied. For more elaborate epoch forma-
tions, some more complicated functional forms may be tried in Eq. (1). Or,
the solutions of the present form for non-integer fractal powers of α may be
taken into account. Yet, mismatches between the real and calculated values
may always exist, due to unpredictability character of short-range ﬂuctua-
tions about longer-range ones. It is obvious that, such analytical approaches
may be used together with the traditional approaches for better prediction
of the markets.

Fig. 1. The Sept.2000 crash in S&P500 is described as a second or-
der approximation by an azimuthal rise and fall in a gravity h= –0.001101
(lcu/day2), where the initial (shooting) speed is v01=1.73 (lcu/day). The
price fall down after the maximum height and inelastically bounces back
with v02= 1.11 (lcu/day) in the same gravity, and rises up to 1200’s in ac-
cordance with the expression χ – χ0 = v2
0/(2h). A recession, back to 800’s is
predicted within the coming 500 days.

Fig. 2. The excursion of DJIA about the Apr-Sep.2000 climax is de-
scribed as a second order approximation by an azimuthal rise and fall of the
price in a gravity h= –0.00606 (lcu/day2). The initial (shooting) speed at
the beginning of 1995 is v01= 10.17 (lcu/day). The price fall down after the
maximum height and inelasticly bounces back with v02= 8.43 (lcu/day) in
the same gravity, and rises up to 11000’s in accordance with the expression
χ – χ0 = v2
0/(2h). A recession, back to 8000’s and below is predicted within
the coming 500 days.

Fig. 3. NASDAQ’s azimuthal motion beginning with the year of 1995 is
described by a gravity h = –0.004119 (lcu/day2) and initial (shooting) speed
of v01=6.08 (lcu/day). The inelastic bouncing speed in the same gravity is
v02=3.10 (lcu/day). A recession, from the present heights back to 1200’s is
predicted within the coming one and a half year.

Fig. 4. a. The epoch begun with the beginning of 2000 has an anti-

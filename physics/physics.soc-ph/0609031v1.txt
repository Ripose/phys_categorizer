Recently, motivated by the pioneer works in revealing the small-world eﬀect and scale-free property
of various real-life networks, many scientists devote themselves to studying complex networks. In
this paper, we give a brief review on the studies of traﬃc ﬂow and eﬃcient routing on scale-free
networks, including the traﬃc dynamics based on global routing protocol, Traﬃc dynamics based
on local routing protocol, and the critical phenomena and scaling behaviors of real and artiﬁcial
traﬃc. Finally, perspectives and some interesting problems are proposed.

INTRODUCTION

II. TRAFFIC DYNAMICS BASED ON GLOBAL
ROUTING PROTOCOL

Many social, biological, and communication systems
can be properly described as complex networks with ver-
tices representing individuals or organizations and links
mimicking the interactions among them [1, 2, 3, 4]. One
of the ultimate goals of the current studies on topologi-
cal structures of networks is to understand and explain
the workings of systems built upon those networks, for
instance, to understand how the topology of the World
Wide Web aﬀects Web surﬁng and search engines, how
the structure of social networks aﬀects the spread of dis-
eases, information, rumors or other things, how the struc-
ture of a food web aﬀects population dynamics, and so
on. The increasing importance of large communication
networks such as the Internet [5], upon which our society
survives, calls for the need for high eﬃciency in handling
and delivering information. Therefore, to understand the
traﬃc dynamics and ﬁnd the optimal strategies for traf-
ﬁc routing is one of the important issues we have to ad-
dress. There have been many previous studies to under-
stand and control traﬃc congestion on networks, with a
basic assumption that the network has a homogeneous
structure [6, 7, 8, 10, 46]. However, many real-life com-
munication networks, such as the Internet [11] and the
World-Wide-Web [12], display scale-free degree distribu-
tion [13, 14], thus it is of great interest to study the traﬃc
ﬂow on scale-free networks. In this light, the traﬃc dy-
namics on complex networks have recently attracted a
large amount of interest from the physical community.

In this paper, we will give a brief review about traf-
ﬁc dynamics on scale-free networks. This paper is orga-
nized as follow: In Sec. 2 and 3, the traﬃc dynamics
with global and local routing protocols are introduced,
respectively. In Sec. 4, the critical phenomena and self-
similarity scaling of real traﬃc and artiﬁcial models are
discussed. Finally, we sum up this paper in Sec. 5.

In this section, we discuss the case where the whole
topological information is available for each router. For
simplicity, all the nodes are treated as both hosts and
routers. The simplest model can be described as follows:
(1) At each time step, there are R packets generated in
the system, with randomly chosen sources and destina-
tions. Once a packet is created, it is placed at the end of
the queue if this node already has several packets waiting
to be delivered to their destinations.

(2) At each time step, each node, i, can deliver at most
Ci packets one step toward their destinations according
to the routing strategy.

(3) A packet, once reaching its destination, is removed

from the system.

We are most interested in the critical value Rc where a
phase transition takes place from free ﬂow to congested
traﬃc. This critical value can best reﬂect the maximum
capability of a system handling its traﬃc. In particular,
for R < Rc, the numbers of created and delivered pack-
ets are balanced, leading to a steady free traﬃc ﬂow. For
R > Rc, traﬃc congestion occurs as the number of ac-
cumulated packets increases with time, simply for that
the capacities of nodes for delivering packets are limited.
To characterize the phase transition, we use the following
order parameter

H(R) = lim
t→∞

C
R

h∆W i
∆t

,

(1)

where ∆W = W (t + ∆t) − W (t), with h· · · i indicating
average over time windows of width ∆t, and W (t) is the
total number of packets in the network at time t. Clearly,
H equals zero in the free-ﬂow state, and becomes positive
when R exceeds Rc.

Since in the Internet, the deviation of traﬃc from the
shortest path is only about 10% [15], one can assume
that the routing process takes place according to the cri-
terion of the shortest available path from a given source
to its destination. Accordingly, ﬁrstly, we investigate
the shortest-path routing strategy, which can be imple-
mented by either of the two ways, ﬁnding the shortest-

path dynamically or following the ﬁxed routing table. In
the former case [16], for each newly generated packet,
the router will ﬁnd a shortest path between its source
and destination, and then, the packet is forwarded along
this path during the following time steps. In the latter
case [17], for any pair of source and destination, one of all
the shortest paths between them is randomly chosen and
put into the ﬁxed routing table that is followed by all the
information packets. Compared with the dynamical rout-
ing algorithm and the information feed-back mechanism,
the ﬁxed routing algorithm is much more widely used in
real communication systems for its obvious advantages
in economical and technical costs [18, 19]. Actually, the
behaviors of those two cases are pretty much the same
[16, 17], thus we will not distinguish them hereinafter.

If the delivering capability of each node is the same,
the critical point Rc of highly heterogeneous network will
be much smaller than that of homogeneous network. It
is because that when all the packets follow their shortest
paths, it will easily lead to the overload of the heavily-
linked router, and the congestion will immediately spread
over all the nodes. Fig. 1 shows the order parameter H
versus R for (a) the two-dimensional lattice with periodi-
cal boundary condition and (b) the Barab´asi-Albert (BA)
network [13, 14] with average degree hki = 4. Clearly, the
throughput, measured by the Rc, of regular network is
much larger than that of scale-free networks.

To provide the theoretical estimate of the value of Rc,
we ﬁrst introduce the concept of betweenness central-
ity (see also the original concept of centrality [20, 21],
the generalized concept of centrality [22], the physical
meaning of betweenness centrality [23], and some re-
cently proposed algorithms for calculating betweenness
[24, 25, 26]). The betweenness centrality of a node v is
deﬁned as

Bv =

σst(v)

FIG. 2:
with average degree hki = 4 and of size N = 1225 (left panel)
and N = 1500 (right panel). Both simulation and analysis
demonstrate that the maximal Rc corresponds to β ≈ 1. The
results are the average over 10 independent runs.

where σst is the number of shortest paths going from s to
t and σst(v) is the number of shortest paths going from s
to t and passing through v. Below the critical value Rc,
there is no accumulation at any node in the network and
the number of packets that arrive at node v is, on average,
RBv/N (N −1). Therefore, a particular node will collapse
when RBv/N (N − 1) > Cv. Considering the transferring
capacity of each node is ﬁxed to C and congestion occurs
at the node with the largest betweenness centrality, Rc
can be estimated as [16, 27]

Rc = CN (N − 1)/Bmax,

(3)

where Bmax is the largest betweenness centrality of the
network. This equation illuminates that the network of
larger Bmax has smaller throughput.

For many real-life networks, the betweenness centrality
is strongly correlated with degree. In general, the larger
the degree, the larger the centrality. For many scale-free
networks, it has been shown that the betweenness cen-
trality approximately scales as B(k) ∼ kµ [28, 29], where
B(k) denotes the average betweenness centrality over all
the k-degree nodes. Therefore, in a heterogeneous net-
work, there exists a few high-betweenness nodes, named
hub nodes, which are easy to be congested. This is pre-
cisely the cause of low throughput of scale-free networks.
To enhance the traﬃc capability, Zhao et al. proposed
two traﬃc models [16], where the delivering capability
of a node i is assigned as Ci = 1 + βki (Model I) and
Ci = 1 + βBi (Model II), respectively. Here, 0 < β < 1
is a control parameter. As we have mentioned above (see
Eq.
(3)), it is clear that the throughput of the whole
network will increase if the hub nodes have higher deliv-
Pi Ci keeps
ering capability though the total capability
unchanged. This work suggests a way to alleviate traﬃc
congestions for highly heterogeneous networks: making
nodes with large betweenness as powerful and eﬃcient
as possible for processing and transmitting information.
Particularly, in the model II, the throughput Rc is inde-
pendent of the network topology.

However, there are two reasons that hinder the ap-
plication of those models. First, the capability/power

distributions in some real networks are homogeneous, al-
though their degree distributions are heterogeneous [30].
For example, in the broadcasting networks, the forward-
ing capacity of each node is limited. Especially, in wire-
less multihop ad hoc networks, each node usually has
the same power thus almost the same forwarding capac-
ity [31]. Second, the structure of real networks evolve
ceaselessly, thus the degree and betweenness centrality
of each node vary ever and again. By contrary, one can
not change the delivering capability of a node freely due
to the technical limitation.

For the case that each node has the same delivering
capability C, Yan et al. proposed a novel routing algo-
rithm to enhance the network throughput [32, 33]. Note
that, the path with shortest length is not necessarily the
quickest way, considering the presence of possible traf-
ﬁc congestion and waiting time along the shortest path.
Obviously, nodes with larger degree are more likely to
bear traﬃc congestion, thus a packet will by average
spends more waiting time to pass through a high-degree
node. All too often, bypassing those high-degree nodes,
a packet may reach its destination quicker than taking
the shortest path. For any path between nodes i and j
as P (i → j) := i ≡ x0, x1, · · · xn−1, xn ≡ j, denote

L(P (i → j) : β) =

k(xi)β,

(4)

n−1

X
i=0

where β is a tunable parameter. The eﬃcient path be-
tween i and j is corresponding to the route that makes the
sum L(P (i → j) : β) minimum. Obviously, Lmin(β = 0)
recovers the traditionally shortest path length. All the
information packets follow the eﬃcient paths instead of
the shortest paths.

In Fig. 2, we report the simulation results for the crit-
ical value Rc as a function of β on BA network with
the size N = 1225 and N = 1500, which demonstrate
that the optimal router strategy corresponding to β = 1
and the size of BA network doesn’t aﬀect the value of
optimal β.
In comparison with the traditional routing
strategy (i.e. β = 0), the throughput Rc of the whole
network is greatly improved more then 10 times without
any increase in algorithmic complexity. By extending the
concept of betweenness centrality to eﬃcient betweenness
centrality, that is, using the eﬃcient paths instead of the
shortest paths in the deﬁnition of betweenness central-
ity, the analytic results can be obtained according to the
Little’s law [16, 27, 32]. The analytical results are also
shown in Fig. 2, which agree very well with the simula-
tions. In the previous studies, the betweenness centrality
is always considered as a static topological measure of
networks under the latent assumption that all the infor-
mation packets go along the shortest paths from source
to destination. The work of Yan et al. shows that this
quantity (eﬃcient betweenness) is determined both by
the routing algorithm and network topology, thus one
should pay more attention to the design of routing strate-
gies. For example, a more intelligent router that can de-
tour at obstacle performs much better than traditional

router which just waits at obstacle [34], and a recent
work demonstrates that the dynamical information can
be used to design more eﬃcient routing strategy [35].

III. TRAFFIC DYNAMICS BASED ON LOCAL
ROUTING PROTOCOL

Although the routing protocol using global topological
information is very eﬃcient, it is not practical for huge-
size communication networks and the evolving networks
since the technical limitation of the router. It is because
the router hardware is hard to be designed to have the
capability to storage much information or adapt dynami-
cal information. Therefore, it is also very interesting and
practical to study the traﬃc behaviors on scale-free net-
works based on local information. The simplest network
traﬃc model on local protocol is the random-walk pro-
cess, where each packet is delivered to randomly selected
one of its neighbors as far as it reaches the destination.
The random-walk on scale-free networks has been exten-
sively explored previously [36, 37, 38], however, it is far
from the real traﬃc since it can not reproduce the self-
similar scaling as we will present in the next section.

Motivated by the previous studies about searching en-
gine [39, 40] and the global routing strategy [32] on com-
plex networks, Yin et al. proposed a traﬃc model using
preferential selection among local neighbors [41]. In this
model, to navigate packets, each node performs a local
search among its neighbors. If a packet’s destination is
neighboring, it will be delivered directly to its target, oth-
erwise, it will be forwarded to a neighbor j of its currently
located node i according to the preferential probability

the degree of node i, and α is an adjustable parameter.
Similar to the models mentioned in the last section, the
ﬁrst-in-ﬁrst-out (FIFO) discipline is applied at the queue
of each node. Another important rule, named path itera-
tion avoidance (PIA), is that any edge cannot be visited
more than twice by the same packet. Set the delivering
capability of each node as a constant C, the simulation
results show that the optimal performance of the whole
system corresponds to α = 1 (see Fig. 3). This opti-
mal value can also be analytically obtained [42]. Further
more, if the delivering capability of each node is propor-
tional to its degree, the optimal value of α will shift to
α = 0 [42].

It is worthwhile to emphasize that the behavior of Yin
et al.’s model [41] is similar to that of Yan et al.’s model
[32], and the behavior of Wang et al.’s model [42] is sim-
ilar to that of Zhao et al.’s model [16]. These resem-
blances indicate the existence of some common policies
between the design of global and local routing protocols,
that is, to bypass the hub nodes or to improve the deliv-
ering capability of these nodes can sharply enhance the
throughput of the whole network.

Note that, each router in the present models [41, 42]
needs to know all its neighbors’ degrees and a packet
has to remember the links its has visited, which requires
much intelligence of the system. It may damage the ad-
vantage of local routing strategy since to implement the
PIA rule will make this system even more complicated

4

than the one using ﬁxed routing algorithm. And the
throughput of networks is very low without the PIA rule
due to many times of unnecessary visiting along the same
links by the same packets.

Another factor that aﬀects the performance of local
routing strategy is the area of information a router can
make use of. Based on an artiﬁcial directed World-Wide-
Web model (see some recently proposed theoretical mod-
els of directed World-Wide-Web [43, 44]), Tadi´c et al. in-
vestigated a local routing protocol with ﬁnite buﬀer size
of each router, and found that the next-to-nearest rout-
ing algorithm can perform much better than the nearest
routing algorithm [45]. In this model each packet follows
a random-walk unless its destination appears within the
current router’s searching area, and the next-to-nearest
routing algorithm means the router can directly deliver a
packet to its destination if this destination is within two
steps.

IV. THE CRITICAL PHENOMENA AND
SCALING BEHAVIORS OF TRAFFIC

Recent empirical studies on communication network
have found pervasive evidence of some surprising scal-
ing properties. one example of such discoveries is that
the traﬃc rates of both a given link in the Internet and
a local Ethernet exhibit the self-similarity (or fractal-
like) scaling, and the multifractal scaling is also found
over small time scale [46, 47, 48, 49, 50]. These empiri-
cal studies describe pertinent statistical characteristics of
temporal dynamics of measured traﬃc rate process and
provide ample evidence that these traces are consistent
with long-range correlated behavior. Furthermore, the
observation of a phase transition between the free-ﬂow
phase and the congested phase in the Internet traﬃc is
demonstrated by Takayasu et al. through both the round
trip time experiment [51, 52] and packet ﬂow ﬂuctuation
analysis [53, 54]. They found that the real traﬃc exhibits
the 1/f -type scaling, however, this 1/f scaling can only
be observed near the critical state [51, 52, 53, 54].

Cai et al.

[55] investigated the scaling behavior of
mimic traﬃc rate process near at the critical point gen-
erated by an the model of Yan et al.
[32, 33]. Fig. 4
reports the average number of packets over all the nodes,
W (t) = W (t)/N , as a time series in free, critical and
congested states, respectively. The behaviors of W (t) in
the free and congested states are very simple: In the for-
mer case, it ﬂuctuates slightly around a very low value,
while in the latter case, it increases linearly. However, the
time series at the critical point is very complicated, which
exhibits some large ﬂuctuations like those have been ob-
served in the real traﬃc [56]. This reason resulting in this
phenomenon may be the usage of global routing strategy
that leads to a possible long-range correlation, since this
phenomenon can not be detected from the random-walk
model [36] and the model based on local protocol [41, 42].
However, a very similar phenomenon is also observed in

a traﬃc model with local protocol [57], where the buﬀer
size of each router is ﬁnite.

In the previous studies, the autocorrelation function
and power spectrum are widely used to analyse the self-
similar scaling behaviors of both real [58, 59] and arti-
ﬁcial [57] traﬃc data. However, it is shown that all the
above methods do not work very well for the eﬀect of
non-stationary [60], and are less accurate than the de-
trended ﬂuctuation analysis (DFA) proposed by Peng et
al. [61, 62], which has now been accepted as an important
time series analysis approach and widely used especially
for ﬁnancial and biological data [63, 64, 65, 66, 67].

The DFA method is based on the idea that a correlated
time series can be mapped to a self-similar process by an
integration. Therefore, measuring the self-similar feature
can indirectly tell us the information about the correla-
tion properties. Brieﬂy, the description of the DFA algo-
rithm involves the following steps.

(1) Consider a time series xi, i = 1, · · · , N , where N is

the length of this series. Determine the proﬁle

y(i) =

(3) Calculate the local trend yfit in each box of size
t by a least-square ﬁt of the series, and the detrended
ﬂuctuation function is given as

Y (k) = y(k) − yfit(k).

and repeat the above computation for diﬀerent box sizes
t (i.e. diﬀerent scales) to provide a relationship between
F and t.
If the curve F (t) in a log-log plot displays
a straight line, then F (t) obeys the power-law form tH
with H the slope of this line.

As shown in Fig. 5, the traﬃc rate time series gen-
erated by the model of Yan et al. [32] also exhibits the
self-similar scaling behaviors at the critical point of phase
transition. The scaling exponents calculated with DFA
for diﬀerent β are approximate H ≈ 1, and the value
of β has almost no eﬀect on H. This value of H im-
plies the 1/f -type scaling in the power spectrum and the
long-range correlated behavior in a wide range of scales.
A very recent empirical study on the traﬃc rate process
of a University Ethernet has demonstrated that the real
Ethernet traﬃc displays a self-similarity behavior with
scaling exponent ≈ 0.98 [68], which agrees well with the
present result H ≈ 1.

V. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION

The studies of network traﬃc are now in the ascendant.
Many new discoveries, especially the role of network het-
erogeneity that can sharply reduce the traﬃc capacity,
provide us with new scenarios and problems in under-
standing and controlling traﬃc congestions. Physicists
being not only the new object named scale-free networks,
but also the new methodologies much diﬀerent from those
usually used in the engineering science. As an end of this
brief review, we list a few interesting problems still un-
solved below.

Problem 1: The visual ﬁeld of router may be one of
the most important factors that aﬀects the traﬃc capac-
ity of whole networks. In the random walk [36] the router
knows nothing about the topological information; in the
preferential routing strategy [41], the router knows the
topological information of all its nearest neighbors; in
the global routing protocol [16, 32], each router knows
the whole topological information. Clearly, with wider
visual ﬁeld, the system can perform better. Tadi´c and
Rodgers [45] proposed a local traﬃc model where each
router knows the topological information of all its near-
est and next-nearest neighbors, which, as expected, has
obviously higher throughput than the case where only
the nearest neighbors’ information is available. Up to
now, it lacks a systemic study on the eﬀect of router’s vi-
sual ﬁeld on the traﬃc condition of networks, which may
worth some further work.

Problem 2: A router can memorize huge information
about shortest or eﬃcient paths that, at least, can be
used to implement the strategy of ﬁxed routing table is

very expensive. Even worth, the current technology does
not support the router to do dynamical path-ﬁnding in
large-size networks. So, a relative problem to the preced-
ing one is that what will happen if one mixes the global
and local protocols together, that is, a few routers in
the networks can do global path-ﬁnding or have mem-
orized the shortest/eﬁicient paths and others can only
perform local protocol. A further question is that if the
addition of a few very powerful routers to a traﬃc sys-
tem based on local protocol can sharply enhance the net-
work throughput, which locations should these powerful
routers choose?

Problem 3: Although β = 1 corresponds to the optimal
value of network throughput when using eﬃcient-path
ﬁnding strategy [32], it is really a bad strategy when the
traﬃc density is sparse since to bypass the hub nodes will
increase the average distance between source and desti-
nation. If the traﬃc density is sparse, the strategy with
β > 0 will waste time. Therefore, a natural question
raises: How to use the dynamical information to improve
the performance of network traﬃc? Can we design some
on-line algorithms to guide the information packets?

Problem 4: On one hand, in the network traﬃc dynam-
ics, the maximal betweenness centrality Bmax is the key
factor that determines the network throughput Rc since
the node having maximal betweeness centrality is the
bottleneck of information traﬃc thus is ﬁrstly congested.
On the other hand, the node having maximal betweeness
centrality is also the bottleneck that hinders the syn-
chronization signal’s communication, thus the network
of higher Bmax may of poorer synchronizability [69, 70].
Therefore, we guess there may exist some common fea-
tures between network traﬃc and network synchroniza-
tion, although they seem completely irrelevant. Actually,
some recently proposed methods used to enhance the net-
work synchronizability can also be used to enhance the
network throughput [71, 72, 73, 74]. An in-depth inves-
tigation is of great theoretical interest and we want to
know if those two diﬀerent kinds of dynamics, traﬃc and
synchronization, belonging to some kind of “universality

6

class”.

Problem 5: The routing strategies for real Internet [75]
is of special interest for its practical signiﬁcance. How-
ever, the real Internet is highly clustered and displaying
hierarchical structure [5], thus far from the extensively
studied BA networks. Although there exists some highly-
clustered models with hierarchical structures [76, 77],
they can not capture the detailed topological properties
of real Internet. We have noticed that a recent model [78]
aiming at Internet is very close to the reality, thus it is
interesting to explore the diﬀerence between simulation
results based on BA networks and the model of Zhou and
Mondrag´on [78].

Problem 6: The previous studies mainly focus on the
information ﬂow and corresponding routing strategies.
However, in the urban traﬃc, it is not the routes but the
drivers are intelligent. How can they make use of traf-
ﬁc information to shorten their travelling time [79], and
whether the selﬁsh of each agent will reduce the system
proﬁt [80]?

Abstract:
We investigate systems of indirect voting based on the law of Penrose, in
which each representative in the voting body receives the number of votes
(voting weight) proportional to the square root of the population he or she
represents. For a generic population distribution the quota required for the
qualiﬁed majority can be set in such a way that the voting power of any
state is proportional to its weight. For a speciﬁc distribution of population
the optimal quota has to be computed numerically. We analyse a toy voting
model for which the optimal quota can be estimated analytically as a function
of the number of members of the voting body. This result, combined with
the normal approximation technique, allows us to design a simple, eﬃcient,
and ﬂexible voting system which can be easily adopted for varying weights
and number of players.

1 Introduction

A game theory approach proved to be useful to analyse voting rules im-
plemented by various political or economical bodies. Since the pioneering
contributions of Lionel Penrose who originated the mathematical theory of
voting power just after the World War II [1], this subject has been studied
by a number of researchers, see, e.g. [2, 3] and references therein.

Although the current scientiﬁc literature contains several competing def-
initions of voting indices, which quantitatively measure the voting power
of each member of the voting body, one often uses the original concept of
Penrose. The a priori voting power in his approach is proportional to the
probability that a vote cast by a given player in a hypothetical ballot will be
decisive: should this country decide to change its vote, the winning coalition
would fail to satisfy the qualiﬁed majority condition. Without any further
information about the voting body it is natural to assume that all potential
coalitions are equally likely. This very assumption leads to the concept of
Penrose-Banzhaf index (PBI) called so after John Banzhaf who introduced
this index independently in 1965 [4].

Recent research on voting power was partially stimulated by the political
debate on the voting system used in the Council of Ministers of the European
Union (EU). The double majority system endorsed in 2004 by The Treaty
Establishing a Constitution for Europe, based on ‘per capita’ and ‘per state’
criteria, was criticized by several authors [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]
who pointed out that it is favorable to the most and to the least populated
EU countries at the expense of all medium size states. Ironically, a similar
conclusion follows from a book written ﬁfty years earlier by Penrose [16,
p.73], who also discovered this drawback of a ‘double majority’ system.1

In search for an optimal two-tier voting system (where a set of constituen-
cies of various size elect one delegate each to a decision-making body) Penrose
considered ﬁrst a direct election in a state consisting of N voters and proved
that the voting power of a single citizen decays as 1/√N , provided that the
votes are uncorrelated [1]. To compensate this eﬀect he suggested that the a
priori voting power of each representative in the voting body should behave
proportionally to √N making the citizens’ voting power in all states equal
(the Penrose square root law).

1Penrose wrote: ‘[...] if two votings were required for every decision, one on a per capita
basis and the other upon the basis of a single vote for each country. This system [...] would
be inaccurate in that it would tend to favour large countries.’

2

To achieve such a balance, one may attribute the voting weight of each
state proportional to the square root of its population, and such voting sys-
tems were discussed by several experts also in the EU context [17, 18, 19,
20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 24, 26, 27, 28, 11, 29, 12]. The quota q for the qualiﬁed
majority is still a free parameter of the system and can be optimized in such
a way that the mean discrepancy ∆ between the voting power of each state
and the rescaled root of its population is minimal.

For a concrete distribution of population in the EU consisting of 25 (resp.
27) member states it was found [12, 30], see also [31], that the discrepancy
62 % (resp. 61.5 %)
exhibits a sharp minimum around a critical quota q∗ ∼
falling down to a negligible value. Therefore, the Penrose square root system
with this quota is optimal, in the sense that every citizen in each member
state of the Union has the same voting power (measured by the Penrose-
Banzhaf index), i.e. the same inﬂuence on the decisions taken by the Euro-
pean Council. Such a voting system occurs to give a larger voting power to
the largest EU states than the Treaty of Nice but smaller than the European
Constitution, and thus has been christened by the media as the ‘Jagiellonian
Compromise’.

The existence of such a critical quota q
∗

for which the rescaled PBI indices
of all states are approximately equal to their voting weights, is not restricted
to this particular distribution of population in the EU. On the contrary, it
seems to be a rather generic behaviour which was found by means of numeri-
cal simulations for typical random distributions of weights in the voting body
generated with respect to various probability measures [12, 32, 33]. The value
of q
depends to some extent on a given realization of the random population
∗
distribution, but more importantly, it varies considerably with the number
M of the member states. In the limit M
the optimal quota seems to
tend to 50%, in consistence with the so called Penrose limit theorem [34, 35].
Working with random probability distributions it becomes diﬃcult to get
any analytical prediction concerning the functional dependence of q
on the
∗
number M of voting states. Therefore in this work we propose a toy model in
which an analytical approach is feasible. We compute the PBIs for this model
distribution of population consisting of M states and evaluate the discrepancy
∆ as a function of the quota q. The optimal quota q
is deﬁned as the value at
∗
which the quantity ∆(q) achieves its minimum. This reasoning performed for
an arbitrary number of states M allows us to derive an explicit dependence
q
(M). Results obtained analytically for this particular model occur to be
∗
close to these received earlier in numerical experiments for random samples.

Thus we are tempted to design a simple scheme of indirect voting based on the
square root law of Penrose supplemented by a rule setting the approximate
value of the optimal quota q
as a function of the number of players M.
∗
The normal approximation of the number of votes achieved by all possible
coalitions provides another estimate of the optimal quota as a function of the
quadratic mean of all the weights.

This work is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we recall the deﬁnition of
Penrose-Banzhaf index and deﬁne the optimal quota. Sect. 3 provides a de-
scription of the toy model of voting in which one player is c times stronger
than all other players. We describe the dependence of the optimal quota in
this model on the number of voters for c = 2 and c = 3. In Sect. 4 we discuss
the optimal quota applying an alternative technique of normal approxima-
tion. The paper is concluded in Sect. 5, where we design a complete voting
system. The heuristic proof of the validity of the normal approximation
method is given in Appendix.

2 A priori voting power and critical quota

Consider a set of M members of the voting body, each representing a state
with population Nk, k = 1, . . . , M. Let us denote by wk the voting weight
attributed to k-th representative. We work with renormalized quantities,
M
i=1 wi = 1, and we assume that the decision of the voting body
so that
is taken if the sum of the weights of all members of the coalition exceeds
P
[0.5, 1], i.e. we consider so called (canonical) weighted
the given quota q
majority voting game [q; w1, . . . , wM ], see [2].

∈

To analyse the voting power of each member one has to consider all 2M
possible coalitions and ﬁnd out the number ω of winning coalitions which sat-
isfy the qualiﬁed majority rule adopted. The quantity A := ω/2M measures
the decision-making eﬃciency of the voting body, i.e. the probability that it
would approve a randomly selected issue. Coleman called this quantity the
power of a collectivity to act [36]. For a thorough discussion of this concept,
see [34, Ch. 6].

The absolute Penrose–Banzhaf index (PBI) ψk of the k–th state is deﬁned
as the probability that a vote cast by k–th representative is decisive. This
happens if k is a critical voter in a coalition, i.e. the winning coalition with
k ceases to fulﬁl the majority requirements without k. Assuming that all 2M
coalitions are equally likely, we see that the PBI of the k–th state depends

4

only on the number ωk of winning coalitions that include this state. Namely,
the number ηk of these coalitions, where a vote of k is decisive, is given by:

ηk = ωk −

(ω

ωk) = 2ωk −

−

ω ,

and so the absolute Penrose-Banzhaf index of the k–th state is equal to
ψk = ηk/2M
1. To compare these indices for decision bodies consisting of
diﬀerent number of players, it is convenient to deﬁne the normalised PBIs:

βk :=

In the Penrose voting system one sets the voting weights proportional to
M
i=1 √Ni for
the square root of the population of each state, i.e. wk = √Nk/
k = 1, . . . , M. For any level of the quota q one may compute numerically the
power indices βk. The Penrose rule would hold perfectly if the voting power
of each state would be proportional to the square root of its population.
Hence, to quantify the overall representativeness of the voting system one
can use the mean discrepancy ∆, deﬁned as the root mean square deviation:

∆ :=

The optimal quota q
is deﬁned as the quota for which the mean discrepancy
∗
∆ is minimal. Note that this quota is not unique and usually there is a whole
interval of optimal points. However, the length of this interval decreases with
increasing number of voters.

Studying the problem for a concrete distribution of population in the
European Union, as well as using a statistical approach and analyzing several
random distributions of population we found [12, 30] that in these cases all
M ratios βk/wk (k = 1, . . . , M), plotted as a function of the quota q, cross
approximately near a single point, i.e.
βk ≈
for k = 1, . . . , M. In other words, the discrepancy ∆ at this critical quota q
∗
is negligible. The existence of the critical quota was conﬁrmed numerically in
a recent study by Chang, Chua, and Machover [32]. (This does not contradict
the fact that there is a wide range of quotas, where the mean discrepancy
is small [29, 37].) In the next section we propose a toy model, for which a
rigorous analysis of this numerical observation is possible.

= wM = (1

Consider a voting body of M members and denote by wk, k = 1, . . . , M
their normalized voting weights. Assume now that a single large player
with weight wL := w1 is the strongest one, while remaining m := M
1
players have equal weights wS := w2 =
wL)/m. We
1/2, since in the opposite case, for some values of
may assume that wL ≤
q, the strongest player would become a ‘dictator’ and his relative voting
power would be equal to unity. Furthermore, we assume that the number of
small players m is larger than two, and we introduce a parameter c := wL/wS
which quantiﬁes the diﬀerence between the large player and the other players.
Thus we consider the weighted voting game
, where the
population distribution is characterized by only two independent parameters,
say, the number of players M and the ratio c. Sometimes it is convenient
to use as a parameter of the model the weight wL, which is related with the
ratio c by the formula c = mwL/(1
wL). On the other hand, the qualiﬁed
majority quota q, which determines the voting system, is treated as a free
parameter and will be optimized to minimize the discrepancy (3). Note that
a similar model has been analysed in [38].

in (12), ∆ (q) is not a continuous function of the quota, and, consequently,
the optimization problem min ∆(q) does not have a unique solution and the
minimal value may be greater than 0, see Fig.1b. Nevertheless, applying

4 Normal approximation

Let us have a closer look at the approximate formula (15) for the optimal
quota. In the limit M
the optimal quota tends to 1/2 in agreement
with the Penrose limit theorem [34, 35]. Numerical values of the approximate
optimal quota qs obtained in our toy model for c = 2 and c = 3 are consistent,
with an accuracy up to two per cent, with the data obtained numerically by

averaging quotas over a sample of random weights distributions [12, 33].2
Furthermore, the above results belong to the range of values of the quota
for qualiﬁed majority, which have been used in practice or recommended by
experts on designing the voting systems.

Consider now a voting body of M members and denote by wk, k =

where Φ is the standard normal cumulative distribution function. The au-

normal curve, where the ‘density’ of the histogram is approximately linear,
the ratios βk/wk (k = 1, . . . , M) are close to 1. In other words the quota qn
is close to the optimal quota q

from the normal approximation formula for the absolute Banzhaf indices. In
particular we use heuristic arguments to demonstrate that in this case

quota. In this aim, it is enough to consider one ‘small’ state and an even number of ‘large’
states with equal population (i.e. c < 1 in our toy model), see [34, 35]. As Lindner stressed:
‘experience suggests that such counter-examples are atypical, contrived exceptions’.

5 Complete voting system

We shall conclude this paper proposing a complete voting system based on
the Penrose square root law and the toy model. The system consists of a
single criterion only and is determined by the following two rules:

3The calculations are based on data from: 50 years of ﬁgures on Europe. Data 1952-
2001. Oﬃce for Oﬃcial Publications of the European Communities: Luxembourg; 2003,
and on data from: EUROSTAT: Lanzieri G. Population in Europe 2005: ﬁrst results.

A. The voting weight attributed to each member of the voting body of size
M is proportional to the square root of the population he or she represents;

B. The decision of the voting body is taken if the sum of the weights of

members of a coalition exceeds the quota qs = (1 + 1/√M)/2.

Alternatively, one can set the quota to qn = (1 + (

Such a voting system is extremely simple, since it is based on a single
criterion. It is objective and so cannot a priori handicap a given member
of the voting body. The quota for qualiﬁed majority is considerably larger
than 50% for any size of the voting body of a practical interest. Thus the
voting system is also moderately conservative. Furthermore, the system is
representative and transparent: the voting power of each member of the vot-
ing body is (approximately) proportional to his voting weight. However, as a
crucial advantage of the proposed voting system we would like to emphasize
its extendibility: if the size M of the voting body changes, all one needs to
do is to set the voting weights according to the square root law and adjust
the quota accordingly. As the number M grows, the eﬃciency of the system
does not decrease.

The formulae for the quotas qs (M) and qn can be also applied in other
weighted voting games. Note that for a ﬁxed number of players the quota
qs (M) does not depend on the particular distribution of weights in the voting
body. This feature may be relevant, e.g. for voting bodies in stock companies
where the voting weights of stockholders depend on the proportion of stock
that investors hold and may vary frequently.

It is a pleasure to thank W. Kirsch, A. Pajala, T. Soza´nski, and T. Za-
stawniak for fruitful discussions, and to F. Bobay, M. Machover, A. Moberg,
and E. Ratzer for helpful correspondence on voting systems. We also would
like to thank an anonymous referee for helping us to clarify several important
points of our reasoning.

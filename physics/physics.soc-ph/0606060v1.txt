Abstract

We show by Monte Calro (MC) simulation that the hierarchy and villages

emerge simultaneously in a challenging society when the population density ex-

ceeds a critical value. Our results indicate that among controlling processes

of diﬀusion and ﬁghting of individuals and relaxation of wealth, the trend of

individuals challeninging to stronger neighbors plays the pivotal role in the self-

organization of the hierarchy and villages.

1 Introduction

Social structure in various forms exists in the human society and in animals. In the

Middle Ages, many villages existed each of which was ruled by a feudal lord and his

clan. At present, several nations dominate the world with many followers and some

challengers. A key question is how to understand the universal nature in the emergence

of these hierarchies which consist of a small number of winners and many losers. It is

also an important question to ﬁnd the mechanism for the simultaneous emergence of

the villages and the hierarchy.

Basically, social diﬀerence occurs when two moving individuals meet and ﬁght each

other where the winner deprives the loser of wealth or power. The winning probability

1

of a ﬁght depends on the diﬀerence between wealth of two individuals engaging in

the ﬁght. Furthermore, the wealth of an individual decays to and the negative wealth

(debt) increases to zero when the individual does not ﬁght. Many aspects of the society

can be modeled by setting rules to diﬀusion, ﬁghting and relaxation processes.

In this paper, we consider a challenging,or bellicose society where individuals try

to challenge thier neibours if possible. We show by Monte Carlo (MC) simulation that

the critical population density for emergence of the hierarchy is much lower than those

in the no-preference society[1] and in a timid society[2]. Furthermore, we show that

the hierarchy and villages emerge simultaneously in this society; in the no-preference

society[1] or in a timid society[2], the hierarchy emerges spontaneously but no villages

are observed. Namely, we show that among controlling processes, the trend of individ-

uals challenging to stronger neighbors plays the critical role in the self-organization of

the structure.

We organize this paper as follows; in Sec. 2, a challenging society is modelled by

setting hostile move of individuals. The results of the MC simulation is presented in

Sec. 3 where the density dependence of the order parameter and the proﬁle of winning

probability. We also show the formation of villages in the challenging society. Section

4 is devoted to discussion.

2 A challenging society

Bonabeau et al.[1] have shown that a hierarchical society can emerge spontaneously

from an equal society by a simple algorithm of ﬁghting between individuals who diﬀuse

on a square lattice by a one step simple random walk. Suppose individual i tries to

move onto the site occupied by individual j and these two individuals engage in a

ﬁghting. The ﬁghting rule is characterised by the winning probability wij of individual

i against individual j which is assumed to be

wij =

1
1 + exp{η(Fj − Fi)}

,

(1)

where Fi is the wealth of individual i and η(> 0) is a controlling parameter of the

model. Therefore, when the diﬀerence of the wealths is large, the stronger one wins all

the ﬁghts, and when Fi ≃ Fj, the winning probability deviates from 1/2 linearly in the

2

diﬀerence Fi − Fj. The winner occupies the lattice site and increases its wealth by 1,

and the loser moves to the site previously occupied by i and reduces its wealth by 1.

When individual i is not involved in any ﬁght in one MC time step (MC tries during

which all idividuals are accessed once), its wealth is assumed to decay as

Fi(t + 1) = Fi(t) − µ tanh[Fi(t)],

(2)

where the unit of time is one MC step. When the wealth is large, it decays by a

constant amount per one MC step, Fi(t + 1) = Fi(t) − µ, i.e. a rich person does not

waste his/her wealth. When the wealth is small, it decreases at a constant rate, that

is Fi(t + 1) = (1 − µ)Fi(t). Here, µ is another controlling parameter of the model.

The social hierarchy can be characterized by the fact that some people have won

and some other people have lost more ﬁghts. Suppose individual i won Wi times in

Xi ﬁghts for a given time interval. Then the order parameter σ can be deﬁned by the

mean square deviation of Wi/Xi from 1/2,

Bonabeau et al showed by MC simulation that the social hierarchy self-organizes at a

critical density as the population density is increased. Note that the relaxation process

plays a critical role to have such a transition[3, 4].

In order to study the emergence of social hierarchy and villages in the society of

challengers, we introduce a bellicose diﬀusion strategy: When an individual makes one

step random walk on the square lattice, it always moves to a site occupied by some

one, and when more than two sites are occupied, it always challenges the strongest

among them. An individual is prohibited to ﬁght suscessively with the same opponent.

Employing the same rule for the ﬁghting and relaxation processes as Bonabeau et al[1],

we examined the emergence of hierarchy and spacial structure in this society by MC

simulation.

3 Monte Carlo simulation

MC simulation was performed for N = 3500 individuals on the L × L square lattice

with periodic boundary conditions from L = 60 to L = 600.

Figure 1 shows the dependence of the order parameter on the population density.

We see the transition occurs at ρ ≃ 0.04 when µ = 0.1 and η = 0.05, which is much

lower than the critical value for no-preference society (ρ ≃ 0.1 for the same µ and η)

studied by Bonabeau et al[1].

The detailed structure in population is monitored by the proﬁle of the winning

frequency Wi/Xi. Figure 2 shows the proﬁle of the winning frequency for four diﬀerent

population density; ρ = 0.022, 0.056, 0.086 and 0.714. In the egalitarian society at

low densities below the critical density, the proﬁle shows a sharp peak at Wi/Xi = 0.5.

When the density exceeds the critical value, the distribution of the winning probability

becomes widespread, and at the same time individuals with winning probability above

95% and with winning probability less than 5% emerge,

We conventionally classify individuals into three groups by the number of ﬁghts

which an individual won; winners are individuals who won more than 2/3 of ﬁghts

and losers are individuals who won less than 1/3 of ﬁghts. Individuals between these

two groups are called middle class. Figure 3 shows the population of each class as a

function of the population density. It is interesting to note that the emergence of the

hierarchy is signiﬁed by appearance of small number of winners. This is a clear contrast

to a timid society where individuals always avoid ﬁghting[2]. In the timid society, the

hierarchical society emerges in two steps; the ﬁrst and the second transition are signiﬁed

by appearance of losers and winners, respectively.

We now proceed to examine the spatial structure of each state in the steady state,

which is shown in Fig. 4. In the egalitarian society, no spatial structure is observed.

When the population density exceeds the critical value, villages emerge, each of which

consists of small number of winners and large number of middle class and losers. The

size of the largest village depends strongly on the density; At the density just above the

critical value, all individuals belong to one compact cluster as shown in Fig. 4(b). As

the density is increased, the number of clusters increases and thus the size of the largest

cluster is rather small (Fig. 4 (c)). When the density is larger than a critical percolation

density, one large cluster appears which percolates the system (Fig. 4(d)). The critical

percolation density is about 0.65, which is larger than the critical percolation density

0.593 of the square lattice. This is due to the fact that in the model under consideration

individuals have eﬀectively strong attractive interaction[5].

We see that winners (red dots) are near the center of the village, surrounded by

people in the middle class (green dots), and losers (blue dots) are at its perimeter. For

ρ = 0.086, we compare the population proﬁle of winning frequency of each village, which

is shown in Fig. 5 It is interesting to observe that the proﬁle is more or less common for

all villages. This may be compared with the structure of medieval villages, where a few

people dominate the village with many subordinates. The number of villages observed

in the observation time depends on the population density. At higher densites, villages

form a percolating cluster, corresponding to the borderless situation.

4 Discussion

We have shown that in a bellicose society the hierarchy self-organizes at much lower

population density compared with the no-preference or a paciﬁst societies. Among the

basic processes of diﬀusion, ﬁghting and relaxation, a small change in the diﬀusion

process aﬀects signiﬁcantly the self-organiztion of the social structure. In particluar,

preference in the diﬀusion process plays an important role in the formation of spatial

structure. The reason for the villages to be formed in the bellicose society is in the

eﬀective attraction between individuals due to the diﬀusion algorithm, namely an in-

dividual always stay in the visinity of other individulas. Therefore the formation of

villages is somewhat similar to the condensation of droplets in a gas.

In this paper, we have discussed the emergence of villages in the time period of our

MC simulation. It is an open question to ﬁnd out the distribution of villages in the long

time limit. In fact, there are no mechnism to keep the center of mass of each village

at the same position and thus each village can diﬀuse and may collide and merge with

other village.

Another open and important quesition is to see the eﬀect of the range of the ran-

dom walk. The distance of one step of the random walk represents the mode of trans-

portation. Therefore, as the mode of transportation advances, the eﬀective population

density is considered to increase and thus the globalization may occur at lower pop-

ulation density. These questions will be studied in the future. One can expect that

various structures of society can be analyzed within the same frame work, which will

eventually help in proposing the right policy.

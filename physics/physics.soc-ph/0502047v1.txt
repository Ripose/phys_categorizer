Suicide: the key role of short range ties

Bertrand M. Roehner 1

Institute for Theoretical and High Energy Physics
University Paris 7

Abstract The paper explores the connection between short-range social ties (i.e. links with close
relatives) and the occurrence of suicide. The objective is to discriminate between a model based on
social ties and a model based on psychological traumas. Our methodological strategy is to focus on
instances characterized by the severance of some social ties. We consider several situations of this
kind. (i) Prisoners in the ﬁrst days after their incarceration. (ii) Prisoners in solitary conﬁnement
(iii) Prisoners who are transferred from one prison to another. (iv) Prisoners in closed versus open
prisons. (v) Prisoners in the weeks following their release. (vi) Immigrants in the years following
their relocation. (vii) Unmarried versus married people.

Furthermore, in order to test the impact of major shocks we consider the responses in terms of suicides
to the following shocks. (i) The attack of September 11, 2001 in Manhattan. (ii) The Korean War. (iii)
The two world wars. (iv) The Great Depression in the United States. (v) The hyperinﬂation episode
of 1923 in Germany. Major global traumatic shocks such as 9/11 or wars have no inﬂuence on suicide
rates once changing environment conditions have been controlled for.

Overall, it turns out that the observations have a natural interpretation in terms of short-range ties. In
contrast, the trauma model seems unable to adequately account for many observations.

1 Introduction

The paper examines two alternative interpretations of the phenomenon of suicide. The ﬁrst one was
put forward in a previous paper (Roehner 2005) while the second one was embodied in objections
raised by this paper. The two interpretations are recalled in the introduction. The rest of the paper
presents evidence speciﬁcally selected in order to provide “critical experiments” which should allow
a clear choice to be made between the interpretations in competition.
In Roehner (2005), a paper which for the sake of concision will be referred to as Bridge, a parallel was
drawn between the strength of intermolecular bonds on one hand and of interpersonal ties on the other
hand. It was pointed out that, irrespective of the precise nature of the bonds, whether ion-ion, dipole-
dipole, dipole-induced dipole, etc., it is their strength which explains a broad range of phenomena
such as for instance boiling point, heat of vaporization, rate of evaporation, etc. Similarly, it was
observed that, irrespective of their precise nature, whether husband-wife, parent-children, friend-
friend and so forth, it is the strength of these ties which determine a broad range of social phenomena
such as for instance school dropout, desertion, suicide, etc. In Bridge I suggested that, as we do not
yet have adequate means for measuring the strength of social ties, one should focus on situations in
which social ties have been severed. Imprisonment, emigration and divorce are three cases where
former ties are severed. In the case of imprisonment all former links with family, friends or neighbors
are cut off. In the case of emigration, only the links with the family members who emigrated together
are preserved. In the case of divorce, the bond between husband and wife is broken; for one of the
partner (usually the former husband) the links with the children are also weakened to a large extent.

I now come to the alternative interpretation as suggested by Professors Bernard Diu (oral communi-
cation) and Didier Sornette (email of May 16, 2004). The point is that the suicides occurring shortly
after an arrest (which was one of the situations on which Bridge focused) can also be attributed to the
psychological trauma of being arrested and incarcerated. Naturally, the same argument can be used in
the two other cases as well. Instead of the severance of the social ties one would incriminate the shock
and grief of the separation. For short, this perspective will be referred to as the trauma interpretation.
Does it really matter whether one adopts one interpretation or the other? It does make a difference for
at least two reasons. (i) The social tie framework is not dissimilar to what can be observed in physical
or biological systems. On the contrary, the trauma mechanism relies on psychological reactions for
which there is no parallel in the physical or biological worlds. If we settle for this interpretation we
must deﬁnitely give up the prospect of a uniﬁed perspective. (ii) Even though we do not yet have any
means for measuring the strength of social ties one can expect that this will become possible in the
future. Once we will be able to measure the coupling strength between (for instance) husband and
wife, one may expect that the same coupling will play a role (albeit not exactly the same role) in all
phenomena in which this link is dissolved as for instance in the death, imprisonment or separation
of one of the partners. On the contrary, in the trauma framework one has to resort to different (and
largely ad hoc) shocks which have no reason to be related in any way. In short, the trauma perspective
is hardly conducive to the building of a satisfactory theoretical framework.

In order to prevent any misinterpretation we must insist on the importance of the transient state
between two equilibrium situations. When the social environment of an individual changes as in
the case of imprisonment or emigration, the old ties are severed and it takes some time to establish
new links even if the new environment is no less favorable than the old one. Thus, for instance, if a
prisoner is moved from one prison to another, it will require some time to establish ties in the new
establishment even if the latter is very similar to the previous one. This phenomenon is very similar
to what happens when two liquids A and B are mixed. There is a transient state during which new
B bonds are established between the molecules of the two liquids. Naturally, at the molecular

The paper proceeds as follows. The second section provides evidence about the sharp increase in
suicide rates which occurs consecutively to imprisonment, or consecutively to a change in imprison-
ment conditions. In the third section, I compare suicide rates for immigrants versus non-immigrants.
In the fourth section I compare suicide rates for married versus non-married individuals. In the ﬁfth
section I show that macro-traumas such as wars or the attack of September 11, 2001 have no impact
on suicide rates. All these cases have been selected with the purpose of discriminating between the
two alternative interpretations.

Before we begin, we should explain how this study is related to the work centered on stock markets
which was done by econophysicists in the last decade. If momentarily we forget the economic agents
who buy and sell stocks, we can then see them as entities which move in a one-dimensional space
deﬁned by their prices. Their moves obviously are interdependent in the sense that closely related
sectors (e.g. microprocessors, computers or softwares) move in parallel. This explains why the
question of the interdependence between stocks is of central importance. Econophysics groups have
been using various approaches to measure couplings between stocks. One of these is to analyze the
properties of the correlation matrix of a broad sample of stock prices1, but there are several others.
The interested reader can ﬁnd more information in the following papers: Bonano et al. (2001), Drozdz
et al. (2001), Kim et al. (2004), Mantegna et al. (2004), Plerou et al. (2001), Sornette et al. (2003),
Stauffer et al. (1999). The question of interaction strength is not only of importance in ﬁnance, but
also in economics. In this respect on can mention the exploration of the coupling strengths between
several spatially separated commodity markets (see for instance Roehner 1995). In all these cases the
links can be identiﬁed by probing the interdependence of prices. This raises an obvious question: for
social ties do we have something similar to prices? If the thesis developed in this paper is correct,
suicide rates can indeed be used for the purpose of measuring social ties just as prices permit to
estimate economic ties.

2 Suicide in prison

The purpose of Fig. 1 is to summarize some of the evidence presented in Bridge. These data describe
the evolution in suicide rate in the hours, days, weeks and years following an incarceration. The
decrease roughly follows a power law at least until the plateau phase is reached.
The exponent of the power law is 1.1, in other words:

suicide rate

1/[time elapsed since incarceration]1.1

∼

Over the ﬁrst week the average relaxation time is about 2 days. In itself this phenomenon does not
allow us to discriminate between the two interpretations2. In the tie interpretation one would say that
the propensity to commit suicide declines as new links are formed for instance with fellow inmates,
police ofﬁcers, wardens or layers. In the trauma perspective one would say that the trauma brought
about by the incarceration recedes in the course of time in the minds of the inmates. One possible way
for discriminating between the two explanations would be to identify a phenomenon which results in
a sharp increase of suicide rates without involving an initial trauma. Another test would be to study
a situation which involves an initial trauma but does not result in increased suicide rates. In what
follows, these two tests will be used successively.

1This approach is at the base of Markowitz’s portfolio theory.
2However, it will be useful by providing a broad overview of typical orders of magnitude to which subsequent suicide

rates can be compared.

Fig.1: Suicide rate of prisoners in the course of time after their incarceration. In the two days
following incarceration the suicide rate decreases rapidly (the relaxation time is 6.2 hours). Subsequently, the
decrease continues at a much slower rate (in the ﬁrst week the relaxation time is 81 hours). After two years the
suicide rate tends towards the rate in the male population. Sources: Hayes et al. (1988, p. 36), Roehner (2005).

2.1 Impact of solitary conﬁnement

The evidence on which we rely in this paragraph concerns suicides which occurred in solitary con-
ﬁnement cells in New York State prisons. These cells, also called “special housing units”, are used
for the purpose of punishing inmates for rebellious behavior. The regime in these cells implies con-
ﬁnement 23 hours a day and little human contacts with the outside. On December 31, 2001 there were
3, 654 inmates in solitary conﬁnement cells representing 5.4% of the total population of inmates in
New York State. The average time spent in these cells was 4.6 months in 2001. Under New York State
law there is no limit to the amount of time an inmate can be kept in conﬁnement. In 2001 the average
annual suicide rate in prison was 26 per 100, 000, but it reached 140 (i.e. 5.4 times higher) in solitary
6) but a a ratio of
conﬁnement. It is true that the number of suicides in a single year was small (

∼

5.4 is nevertheless highly signiﬁcant3. Furthermore, the same observation also holds for the 3-year
period 1998-2000: in this case the suicide rate in conﬁnement was 8.7 times higher than in prison.
Over the four years 1998-2001 the average suicide rate in conﬁnement is about 8 times higher than
in prison. Let us now examine the possible explanations of this effect in the two perspectives. In the
tie interpretation, the higher suicide rate would be attributed to the severance of the links with former
inmates and wardens and the difﬁculty of building new ones due to conﬁnement. In the trauma in-
terpretation, one would argue that the shift from prison to conﬁnement brought about a trauma which
accounts for the higher suicide rate. According to this interpretation the suicide rate in conﬁnement
should decrease in the course of time as the trauma subsides. If one could know the distribution over
time of the suicides which occur in conﬁnement cells, that would provide a crucial tests. Indeed, as
few new ties are formed in conﬁnement the tie hypothesis would lead us to predict that the suicide
rate in conﬁnement should decrease at a much slower rate than what we observed in Fig. 1. So far,
we were not able to ﬁnd such data.

2.2 The silent system

A related effect was observed in the 19th century. Starting from the premise that prisoners learn
criminal ways from each other and that on the contrary isolation would put prisoners face to face with
their conscience and encourage penitential reﬂection, prison reformers introduced what was called
In the Pennsylvania system, prisoners were kept isolated in individual cells all
the silent system.
the time. In the Auburn (New York State) system they were kept in cells during night and evening;
during the day they had to work together but in enforced silence. In 1842 the English writer Charles
Dickens was authorized to visit the Pennsylvania’s penitentiary. In his account of the visit he wrote:
“A prisoner sees the prison ofﬁcers, but with that exception he never looks upon a human countenance
or hears a human voice. He is a man buried alive” (Dickens 1842). Under such circumstances the tie
interpretation would lead us to expect high suicide rates4. This was indeed the case although there is
only scant quantitative evidence.

•

In a lecture given by the prominent British lawyer Louis Blom-Cooper (1987), we learn that in
1877, after adoption of the silent system in Britain, “the suicide rate among prisoners was as high as
1, 760 per 100, 000”.

•

Going into the same direction are the high levels of suicide rates in prison mentioned in Bridge
(table 2). For instance 190/105 in Belgium (1872) and 860/105 in Saxony (1872), two places where
we know the silent system was adopted.

At a more qualitative level, we read that the Pennsylvania system “led to high rates of suicide

•

and insanity” (Telzrow 2002) 5.

3The argument goes as follows. The expression of the standard deviation σm of the mathematical expectation m of
the suicide rate is: σm = pD/n, where D is the variance of the suicide rate and n the number of inmates (Ventsel 1973,
p. 307). To get an estimate for σm one ﬁrst needs an estimate for D. It can be obtained from a time series of suicide
rates. By taking for instance the county of Chautauqua in New York State (which has about 65,000 male inhabitants)
over 20 years (1979-1998) one gets D = 36 and σm = 1.3 for the total population of 65, 000 inmates in New York
State. For the inmates in conﬁnement the σm will be p1/0.054 = 4.2 times larger, which gives σm = 5.5. Thus, the
26 = 114 of suicide rates in conﬁnement versus in prison represents 20 times the standard deviation.
difference 140
The probability of occurrence of a statistical ﬂuctuation of this magnitude is exceedingly small. For x = 20 one gets:
1

Φ∗(x) = (1/√2)erfc(x/2)
4Naturally, such a prediction is conditioned by the availability of means for committing suicide. If there are not sheets,
towels, glasses, windows nor anything sharp that could be used as a knife, committing suicide becomes nearly impossible.
Naturally, living in a cell deprived of almost everything would be a nightmare that is likely to affect the prisoner’s mental
health. Under such circumstances, he may commit suicide not in the conﬁnement cell but as soon as allowed to leave it.
It is the difﬁculty of controlling for all these factors which makes the task difﬁcult.

2.3 Effects of a reorganization of social ties

As already noted a change in the social environment results in a disruption followed by a reorganiza-
tion of social ties. This effect is fairly similar to a trauma effect with the result that the two effects
can be easily mistaken one for the other. It is therefore important to get detailed information. Prison
and army statistics offer useful quasi-experiments.
The test of remand centers A ﬁrst test is offered by remand centers in Britain. Prisoners who
are waiting to be sentenced but were remanded in custody by the courts stay in the remand areas
of local jails. Because these remand centers are used for short stays their population is in majority
composed of “new” prisoners. The following table shows that the transient state which characterizes
these prisoners results in suicide rates which are about three times as high as the average prison rate.

This observation is interesting in two respects. (i) The fact that the suicide rate in remand centers
is higher than in solitary conﬁnement is at ﬁrst surprising. Probably the simplest explanation is that
prisoners have much more means of committing suicide in remand centers than in solitary conﬁne-
ment cells. (ii) The analogues in the U.S. of the British remand centers are the jails. But whereas in
remand centers stays are limited to 6 months, in jails they are limited to one year. This is probably
the reason why suicide rates in remand centers are twice as high as in jail (for suicide rates in jail see
the data given in Bridge, table 2, cases 3 to 6).

Moving from one prison to another
In a study done by MacDonald and Sexton (2002) we learn
that suicide rates are increased every time a prisoner is moved from one prison to another. If the time
is counted from the day a prisoner arrives in a prison, the data show that there are approximately as
many suicides during the ﬁrst 6 days as during the following 53 days. The observation should be
considered as fairly robust because it relies on a set of data which covers the 11 years 1990-2000.
In other words the annualized suicide rate is about 9 times higher in the ﬁrst 6 days as in the two
following months. Unfortunately, this observation does not distinguish between initial incarceration
(for which there is a very high suicide rate as we have seen in Fig.1) and subsequent relocations.

Release from prison When a prisoner is released there is a transient state as well. Table 1a shows
that the standard mortality rate of released prisoners in the ﬁrst week after release is about 4 times as
high as in prison. At ﬁrst sight this could seem as a perfect argument against the trauma interpretation.
Indeed, normally one would not interpret the fact of being released as a trauma, quite the contrary. In
the tie perspective the surge in the ﬁrst week has a natural interpretation as being caused by a transient
readjustment of social ties. However, we will see below that it would be inappropriate to jump too
quickly to deﬁnitive conclusions.

The fact that some caution must be exercised is suggested by the second column in table 1a. It shows
that for accidental deaths too, there is also a surge in the ﬁrst week after release. In contrast to suicide
however the rate remains almost 5 times higher than in prison even in subsequent weeks. This is not
really surprising for in prison the risk of being run over by a car or to freeze to death while sleeping
in the street is zero. Table 1b provides additional information about the decrease in standard mortality
rates in the weeks after release. We see that the pattern is basically the same either for suicide, for

these prisoners”. Clearly, additional data for suicide rates in U.S. prisons in the 19th century would be welcome.

Notes: The number within brackets show the data in normalized form (ﬁrst week=1). At ﬁrst sight one may
be tempted to interpret the decrease in the number of suicides per week as reﬂecting a transient state marked
by a reorganization of social ties. However, the parallel observations for deaths by natural causes and by
accidents clearly require different explanations. In the case of death by natural causes a key-factor is the fact
that terminally ill prisoners are released so they can die at home or in hospital. Alcohol is also an important
factor.
Source: Sattar (2001, p. 34)

deaths by natural causes or for deaths by accident. The following precisions may be useful for the
interpretation of these data.

•

Prisoners afﬂicted with a fatal illness are often released in their last weeks of life. This policy
may well account for the fact that the standard mortality rate for overall deaths is about 3 times higher
for ex-prisoners than for prisoners. It may also account for the surge of natural deaths in the ﬁrst week
after release if the policy is to release prisoners in the very last stage of their illness. To make that
point clearer one would need to know the criteria on which release is decided.

•

While the availability of alcohol is fairly limited in prison, all of a sudden it becomes available
once a prisoner is released. In a general way, one knows that there is a strong link between alcohol
consumption and suicide rates. This effect is documented convincingly by Nizard (1998, p. 2).
Naturally, it can be argued that the excessive consumption of alcohol is in itself a kind of suicidal
behavior. The point that we made for alcohol can also be made for drugs.

•

The ex-prisoners considered in Sattar’s study on which the present discussion is based were
under community supervision. In fact, it is for this very reason that their death could be recorded.
However, when the period of supervision of an ex-prisoner comes to an end he leaves the sample
and his death will no longer be recorded. If the period of supervision of an ex-prisoner lasts only

4 weeks his death will not be recorded even if it occurs only 5 weeks after release. Naturally, this
procedure tends to inﬂate the number of deaths which occur shortly after release. To some extent this
may explain the decrease pattern observed in the three columns of table 1b. Unfortunately, this effect
cannot be controlled for.

Transition from civil to military status Being enlisted represents a major change in social envi-
ronment and requires a reorganization of social ties. One would therefore expect a surge in suicide
rate followed by subsequent decrease just as observed in Fig. 1 after incarceration. In a thesis pub-
lished in France almost a century ago, Botte (1911) provides a comparison between the suicide rate
of soldiers in their ﬁrst army year (we call them “new”) and soldiers who had been in the army for
more than one year (we call them “old”). Remember that at the time military service lasted 3 years
for French draftees. On average, for the 1888-1907 period for which Botte provides data, the suicide
rates for new and old soldiers were 26.0/105 and 20.6/105 respectively. The ratio “new”/“old” is
1.26. As expected this ratio is indeed larger than one. However, it is markedly smaller than for the
shift to prison life. From the data given in Bridge it results that for jail inmates (i.e. for less than one
year) the average suicide rate is 130/105 (over the period 1981-1987) while it is 21/105 for inmates
in prison for more than a year). In this case, the ratio is: 130/21 = 6.2.

Botte also gives another comparison which can be of interest in connection with our subsequent
discussion of family ties. He shows that over the period 1878-1908, the average suicide rate was
twice as high for troops stationed in the French colony of Algeria as for troops stationed in France. A
similar result is given in another study for the earlier period 1865-1869: the average suicide rate was
1.28 times larger for troops in Algeria than for the total army (Cristau 1874). The troops in Algeria
differed from those in France in two main respects: (i) They were separated from their relatives to a
greater extent than troops stationed in France. (ii) They comprised indigenous soldiers. Both factors
may have contributed to the higher rate; the ﬁrst factor can be connected to our subsequent discussion
regarding the impact of family links.

2.4 Open vs. closed prisons

Open prisons are without walls or bars and offer the possibility to work or study outside of prison dur-
ing working hours, the evenings and nights being spent in the prison. Open prisons are for prisoners
who are believed not to be a risk to the public. For instance, total objectors who refuse all service in
the conscription system including non-military service may be assigned to an open prison. The data
on which we rely in this paragraph come from two detailed reports published by the British Home
Ofﬁce (Prison Statistics 2001, HPMS Annual Report 2004).

Table 2 shows that suicide rates are at least 10 times higher in closed than in open institutions. The
decision to affect a prisoner to an open rather than to a closed institution is taken in the days or weeks
following the incarceration. In other words, the initial trauma caused by the incarceration is the same
for all prisoners whatever institutions they belong to subsequently. In short, this observation seems
to disprove the trauma explanation. On the contrary, it has a natural explanation in the tie perspective
in so far as open prisons are of course more conducive to the establishment of social ties. One could
be tempted to say that the two populations are not the same which is quite true. However, it is by
no means obvious that a prisoner who represents a threat to the public (and for that reason will be
affected to a closed prison), necessarily has a higher “propensity” for committing suicide.

In the next section we turn to another situation which results in the severance of social ties, namely
emigration.

Notes: There is a difference of at least a factor 10 for suicide rates in open versus closed institutions. Are the
populations in the different categories large enough to lead to substantial suicide rates. Under the assumption
of a suicide rate of about 15/105 it would require a sample of more than 105/(15
8) = 830 prisoners to get at
least one suicide per year. On this basis it can be seen that all samples are large enough except possibly the ﬁrst
(15/105) = 0.46 deaths. The observation
one. In the later case, over the 8 years one would expect 380
gave 0, but it could have been 1, 2 or 3 without altering our conclusion. Note that the closed male institutions
belong to the categories B and C deﬁned in the statistics of the Home Ofﬁce.

3 Suicide rates of immigrants

In the previous section we considered the weakening of social ties when a person is put into custody.
Naturally, this is only one of many possible mechanisms leading to a weakening of social ties. The
process of emigration is another obvious candidate. Back in the 19th century, when an individual
or a family emigrated from, say, Italy to the United States, it meant an almost total severance of the
contacts with relatives, friends and neighbors left behind in Italy. Furthermore, until the language
barrier was surmounted, it was not easy to establish new social ties in the United States except of
course with other Italian immigrants. As a matter of fact, this is certainly the main factor which made
Italian immigrants live together in areas such as “Little Italy” in South Manhattan.

The tie perspective would make us expect suicide rates of Italian immigrants in New York City to be
higher; but higher than what? Higher than the average suicide rate in New York or higher than the
average suicide rate in their region of origin? Fig. 2 answers this question. It turns out that there is a
high correlation between the suicide rates of immigrants in New York and the suicide rates prevailing
in their country of origin. In other words, suicide rates seem to display a great inertia. For groups of
immigrants their suicide rate seems to be a cultural attribute just like their language or religion. We do
not yet have a comprehensive explanation of this effect but in a sense it is not completely surprising.
For instance, the fact that suicide is strongly prohibited by the Catholic Church will tend to lower the
impact of suicide among Catholics both in the country of origin and in New York. The difﬁculty is
that this can be understood in a number of different ways. (i) It can induce families and physicians (at
least if they are Catholic too) to fake the evidence. In this case, it would be nothing but a statistical
bias6. (ii) Alternatively, one can also suppose that suicide rates are really lower among Catholics.

6This kind of arguments was developed by Douglas (1967) who expressed great doubts about the validity of suicide
statistics. That there are indeed measurement problems can hardly be denied. For instance, in 1987 the ofﬁcial suicide
rate in Egypt was equal to 0.1/105 for males and to 0.0/105 for females (Schmidtke et al. 1999). However, the above
correlation shows that if this effect exists, it is only of marginal importance for European countries. On average, the rates
of suicide recorded in New York (mostly by American physicians one can suppose) are consistent with the rates recorded

Suicide rate in country of origin

Fig.2: Suicide rates of immigrants in New York City (1879-1880). Each abbreviation corresponds to
immigrants from a different country of origin (Boh=Bohemia, Sco=Scotland, the others are fairly transparent).
It can be seen that the suicide rates in New York City are higher than in the region of origin which is consistent
with the rearrangement of social ties brought about by the process of emigration. There is a marked correlation
between the levels recorded in the country of origin and in New York City. This consistency provides an overall
reliability check of suicide statistics. The correlation is equal to 0.70 (with a conﬁdence interval at probability
0.95 extending from 0.21 to 0.91) and the slope of the regression line is 1.5
1. The line y = x is shown for
the purpose of comparison. Sources: Durkheim (1897), Krose (1906), Nagle (1882).

Before trying to ﬁnd an explanation one would have to check whether this is really true everywhere
or also depends upon broad regional traditions. We plan to study this question more carefully in a
subsequent paper.

Let us now come back to the question of the two interpretations. Fig. 2 shows that for each country of
origin the suicide rate in New York is increased, the increment being of the order ot 18 per 100,000.
This increment has a natural interpretation in the tie perspective. At ﬁrst sight, one may think that it
is also consistent with the trauma hypothesis. It cannot be denied that the act of emigrating represents

in the countries of origin which shows that the latter are on the whole trustworthy.

a cultural and psychological shock. However, there is a problem with the way this shock subsides
in the course of time. In the case of an incarceration we have seen that suicide rates revert to their
pre-incarceration level within two years approximately. In the case of Fig. 2 we do not know how
long these immigrants had been in New York, but it is probably safe to assume that on average they
had been in New York for more than two years. It would be difﬁcult to understand then why the
emigration shock (presumably less traumatic than an incarceration) would last several years. On the
contrary, a transient period of several years for the formation of new links is in agreement with the
time it takes to learn English and to make new acquaintances.

To our best knowledge there have been very few studies documenting suicide rates among immigrants.
The topic which we consider in the next section, namely the inﬂuence of family links, has given rise
to a larger number of studies.

4 Inﬂuence of family ties

One of the best discriminating tests between the trauma and tie models is to observe the effect of
changing family ties. Table 3 summarizes the evidence for four different countries and for time inter-
vals which cover more than one century. On average, the suicide rate for unmarried men is 2.4 times
higher than for married men; for women the ratio is 1.9. We deliberately excluded the evidence for
separated, divorced or widowed individuals. For these categories the suicide rates are also higher than
for married people but they imply a traumatic event which could serve as an alternative explanation.
On the contrary, for people who never married one can hardly invoke a possible trauma.

Notes: In most cases (except 6) detailed data by age interval were available. We computed the ratio of the
suicide rates in each age interval and then the average m and the standard deviation σ of the ratios. The results
σ. It should be noticed that the category “married” includes both “married
in the table are given in the form m
without children” and “married with children”; consequently, the reduced suicide rates for “married” should
not be attributed solely to marriage but to the combined effect of being married and having children.

Furthermore, there is evidence in the literature showing that married people with children have smaller
suicide rates than married people without children. Unfortunately, most of these observations are

indirect because death certiﬁcates usually do not indicate the number of children of the deceased. As
a result these data require careful discussions which we leave for a subsequent study.

To sum up, one can say that the tie perspective provides a natural interpretation for suicide rate
differentials in various family situations. However, there is one observation which, at ﬁrst sight, it is
not able to accommodate, namely the differential between males and females. In European countries
and in the United States7, whatever their respective family situations, males have suicide rates which
are 2 to 3 times higher than females in same family situations. If one tries to interpret this effect in the
tie model one is led to assume that females have stronger family ties than males. While this makes
sense for married women with children (especially if they are housewives) it does hardly explain why
it is also true for unmarried women respective to unmarried men. In that case one would have to
assume stronger links with parents, brothers, sisters and other close relatives.

It is possible to perform a plausibility test of the former argument. Over the past 60 years, as more
and more women have taken up a job their links with their family tended to become similar to those
of working men. If the tie model holds one would therefore expect a narrowing of the suicide rate
gap. This is indeed what one observes as shown in table 4.

5 Effect of global traumas

The expression “global traumas” refers to dramatic event which affect the society as a whole. The
outbreak of a war or a major disaster belong to this class of events. It has been claimed that such
events reduce the suicide rate because, allegedly, of the polarization they create in human minds.
If true, this effect would be a strong argument in favor of the trauma model. In the tie model one
would not expect any effect based on purely psychological factors. In the case of a war lasting several
years, the expectation must take into account the rearrangement of family ties occasioned by the war
conditions (e.g. the fact that many husbands are enlisted).

In this section we make the following points.

•

Short events which do no imply a reorganization of social ties do not have any incidence on
suicide rates. We consider two episodes of this kind (i) The hyperinﬂation in Germany in 1923 (Fig.
3a) (ii) September 11, 2001 (Fig. 3b).

•

Wars lasting several years have no clear-cut inﬂuence on the suicide rate of females. As far as
males are concerned, there is a decrease in suicide rates. This decrease is difﬁcult to interpret as we
explain below. We consider 3 episodes of this kind (i,ii) World War I in Germany and in the United
States (Fig. 3a and 3c) (iii) World War II in the United States (Fig. 3c) (iv) The Korean War in the
United States (Fig. 3c).

7It does not seem to be true in China or in some parts of India

•

In addition we also consider the period of the Great Depression in the United States. This an
episode which is of a somewhat different kind than the previous ones. It is marked by a substantial
increase in the suicide rates of males but the suicide rate of females increase only slightly (Fig. 3c).

Fig.3a: Number of suicides in Germany 1911-1924. The fact that the direction of variation is not the
same for males and females during the war and the hyperinﬂation episode shows that even major events have
little effect on suicide rates. Source: Statistisches Jahrbuch for das deutsche Reich (various years).

Next we discuss these episodes in more detail.

Hyperinﬂation of 1923 in Germany
It should be recalled that this inﬂationary episode suppressed
the huge internal war debt of the German government. The hyperinﬂation ended in November
1923 when a new mark (the so-called Rentenmark) was introduced on the basis of 1 new mark =
1012 old mark = 0.24 US dollar. Needless to say, at the same time as it extinguished the debt the
hyperinﬂation also obliterated all savings which had not been exchanged for dollars. In other words,
it was really a traumatic event for a large part of the population. Yet, Fig. 3a shows that there is no
clear-cut effect on suicide rates: the suicide rate of males increases (but it may well have been the
continuation of a trend which began in 1918) while the suicide rate of women shows a small decrease.

September 11, 2001 We selected the data in a way aimed at magnifying any possible effect, even

Fig.3b: Number of suicides in New York City before and after September 11, 2001. The graphic
shows the number of suicides in each month of the years 2000, 2001 and 2002. The data for 2000 and 2002
are for the purpose of comparison. It can be seen that between August and December the curves for 2000 and
2001 are very close which indicates that 9/11 has had no signiﬁcant impact on suicide rates. Source: I would

a small one. (i) Instead of looking at suicide rates for the U.S. or for New York State, we focused
on data for New York City where the impact of September 11 would be expected to be largest. (ii)
Instead of annual or quarterly data, we analyzed monthly data so as to be able to identify even an
effect of short duration. Nonetheless, Fig. 3b shows that there is no perceptible effect 8 .

Wars Two preliminary remarks are in order. (i) One should concentrate on countries whose territory
was not occupied. Why? Consider the case of France. During the duration of Word War I the northern
part of its territory was occupied by Germany. As a result the suicide statistics could not be collected

8It would be meaningless to perform a test of signiﬁcance. Such a test would rely on assumptions regarding the
statistical distribution of suicides (in particular its standard deviation) and would not in this case be more reliable than
visual inspection. We see that over September-December, the 2001 curve is very close to the 2000 curve; on the contrary
the 2002 curve deviates from the two others in spite of the fact that there was no major shock in the fall of 2002.

Fig.3c: Suicide rates in the United States during global shocks. The broken lines and the thick solid
lines give the suicide rate for males and females respectively (left-hand scale); the thin solid lines provide a
magniﬁcation of the ﬂuctuations of female rates (right-hand scale). The Great Depression is the only case
where the female and male rates move in the same direction. For the three other cases, suicide rates do not
respond in a consistent and signiﬁcant way. Source: Historical Statistics of the United States (1975). Prior to
1930, the data must be handled with caution because several states (especially in the West) do not belong to
the Registration Area. The dates of entry of each state into the Registration Area can be found in Candiotti et
al. (1948).

and recorded by the French statistical agency. A similar observation applies to World War II because
the departments of the north and east came under direct German rule and were no longer considered
as belonging to France. (ii) It is not at all obvious that suicides occurring in the army in times of
war are truthfully recorded. Why? in a general way committing suicide is seen negatively both by
the military and the families. This is far more true in times of war. For ﬁeld commanders suicides
are seen as a form of desertion. As a result, it is likely that many suicides are declared as being
accidents. “Unfortunately, he shot himself while cleaning his rifﬂe”. Unless one has positive proof
to the contrary, suicide rates among enlisted men should therefore not be considered as reliable,
especially if they are low. For these two reasons one must be particularly careful in selecting the

evidence9.

Effect of World War I in Germany Fig. 3a shows that between 1914 and 1918 there was a 10%
increase in the suicide rate of women. There is therefore no ground for a psychological effect due to
the war 10.

Effect of World War I in the United States As in Germany we observe an increase in the suicide
rate of women, (albeit of small magnitude). In the tie model these increases can be attributed to the
severance (temporarily of permanently) of the link between husbands and wives. This interpretation
could be tested against suicide rate data by age.

Effect of World War II and of the Korean War in the United States Once again we have a
similar pattern: small increase in the suicide rate of females (if one leaves apart the initial drop which
continued the previous trend) and a drop in the suicide rate of men.

Effect of the Great Depression in the United States The Great Depression was much more than a
psychological trauma; it deeply affected the life of millions of people. Therefore it is hardly surprising
that it has had a substantial inﬂuence on suicide rates. In this case we see that the rates of both males
and females display parallel evolutions.

6 Conclusion

We have collected, selected and compared data sets in order to discriminate between the tie model
and the trauma model. It turns out that there is a broad array of evidence in favor of the tie model.
Fig. 4 schematically summarizes this model.

What remains to be done? To see this point more clearly it may be helpful to physicists to draw on a
comparison with physics. Suppose we want to study the movements of a number of pendulums which

9In Chesnais (1976, p. 56,61) there are two graphics comparing suicide rate changes in several countries (Britain,
France, Germany, Sweden Switzerland, USA) during World War I and II. As many of the curves show a marked dip,
the evidence at ﬁrst seems quite impressive. In both wars the dips are particularly large in France. However, as France
cumulates the two causes of bias these dips are largely meaningless. In World War I Switzerland has a big trough. This
would be a good argument in favor of a purely psychological effect for in this case none of the above bias can be invoked.
However, in World War II Switzerland does not display any trough whatsoever.

10There is a 50% decrease in the suicide rate of men. Its magnitude remains an open question for the trough is too big

to be be explained away by unrecorded suicides among the military.

differ in their initial velocities as well as in their shapes. This will be a very difﬁcult task because the
movements are superpositions of (at least) three different effects: movement of a spherical pendulum,
movement of a pendulum whose mass is not a sphere, movement of a Foucault pendulum.
It is
only by distinguishing and sorting out these different mechanisms that it will become possible to get
insight and understanding. The situation is similar with suicides. In this paper we studied the effect
of severing ties. This gave rise to transient and permanent effects. Furthermore there are several
side effects which must be “ﬁltered out”; one can for instance mention the following: (i) The means
and agencies for self-harm available to a potential suicidee greatly affect the suicide rates. (ii) The
availability of drugs, whether medical drugs, narcotics or alcohol, can have a marked effect on suicide
rates.

A last word is in order. Often econophysicists are blamed by social scientists for not giving full credit
to former studies. Did we commit the same fault in this paper? It is true that the phenomenon of
suicide has been studied at least since 185011. However, very few studies have been conducted in
the comparative and analytical spirit pioneered by Emile Durkheim. Even among the later, one ﬁnds
many comparisons which have not been conducted carefully enough (an example was given above
for the effect of wars on suicides) Instead of bringing more light such comparisons just add to the
confusion. Physicists can rely on a century-long tradition of eliminating spurious effects, chasing up
main determinants and disentangling complicated phenomena. Accordingly, econophysicists should
be in a good position to throw some new light on this question.

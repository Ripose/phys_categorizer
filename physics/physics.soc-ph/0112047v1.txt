Abstract

In this paper we present a phenomenological approach to describe a
complex system: scientiﬁc research impact through Citation Mining. The
novel concept of Citation Mining, a combination of citation bibliometrics
and text mining, is used for the phenomenological description. Citation
Mining starts with a group of core papers whose impact is to be exam-
ined, retrieves the papers that cite these core papers, and then analyzes
the technical infrestructure (authors, jorunals, institutions) of the citing
papers as well as their thematic characteristics. The Science Citation In-
dex is used as the source database for the core and citing papers, since its
citation-based structure enables the capability to perform citation studies
easily. This paper presents illustrative examples in photovoltaics (applied
research) and sandpile dynamics (basic research) to show the types of
output products possible. Bibliometric proﬁling is used to generate the
technical infrastructure, and is performed over a number of the citing
papers’ record ﬁelds to oﬀer diﬀerent perspectives on the citing (user)

community. Text mining is performed on the aggregate citing papers,
to identify aggregate citing community themes, and to identify extra-
discipline and applications themes. The photovoltaics applied research
papers had on the order of hundreds of citations in aggregate. All of the
citing papers ranged from applied research to applications, and their main
themes were fully aligned with those of the aggregate cited papers. This
seems to be the typical case with applied research. The sandpile dynamics
basic research papers had hundreds of citations in aggregate. Most of the
citing papers were also basic research whose main themes were aligned
with those of the cited paper. This seems to be the typical case with
basic research. However, about twenty percent of the citing papers were
research or development in other disciplines, or development within the
same discipline. There was no-time lag between publication and citation
by the extra-discipline research papers , but there was a four year lag time
between publication and citation by the development papers.

1 INTRODUCTION

Most scientists publish their ﬁndings to disseminate their research results widely
and hope that their research has some impact in the scientists’ community
and society in general. For many years, citation counts have been used for
this goal. This research evaluation approach has produced interesting results
identifying the complex nature of Physics impact in the research community (for
instance see refs. [6], [15], [9]). This identiﬁcation of diverse research impacts is
important to research managers/ sponsors/ evaluators, and of course performers.
They are interested in the types of people and organizations citing the research
outputs, and whether the citing audience is the target audience. Also, they
are interested in whether the development categories and technical disciplines
impacted by the research outputs are the desired targets. Since fundamental
research can evolve along myriad paths, tracking diverse impacts becomes very
complex.

Recently, scientists have addressed the problem of citation in scientiﬁc re-
search from diﬀerent perspectives: looking for topological description of citation
[2], or for power laws in citation networks [13], or obtaining power laws in num-
ber of cites received by journals according to their number of published papers
[6], or though two-step competition model relating the number of publications
and number of cites. These diﬀerent approaches use power laws trying to obtain
simple results from complex interactions, assuming that the precise details of
the interactions among the parts of the system play no role in determining the
overall behavior of the system[14]. Other approaches try to ﬁnd some kind of
universality in the behavior of research institutions [1],[12]. However, in order to
obtain a detailed representation of the system it is important to know the details
of the interactions. The creation of roadmaps for science and technology illumi-
nates these interactions, and allows the progression of research to be portrayed
from both retrospective and prospective perspectives. and with these [7], [5].
The analysis of the cites and authorship from a social network perspective gives

2

other useful information to characterize scientiﬁc disciplines [10], [11]. However,
these approaches: scaling, networks and roadmaps, have limitations due to the
fact that they explore only partially the data available from the citation sys-
tem. The detailed analysis of all the available data of the citing community
is required to obtain more information and knowledge. Until now there has
been no comprehensive systematic methodology to deal with the information
available through cites of the scientiﬁc article. To overcome the above men-
tioned limitations of these techniques, we have developed a phenomenological
approach to deal with all the citation information available, and obtain a more
detailed description of this complex system. The aim of this paper is to show
how we can obtain a more complete proﬁle of the citing papers, and thereby
get a more complete representation of the impact of science. The application of
this kind of phenomenological detailed description is useful to obtain a diﬀerent
and illustrative view of the complex systems.

The enhanced coverage of the research literature by the Web version of the
Science Citation Index (SCI-˜5300 leading research journals) allows a broad
variety of bibliometric analyses of R&D units (papers, researchers, journals,
institutions, countries, technical areas) to be performed.

Aggregation of citation number counts is characteristic of almost all pub-
lished citation studies[6],[13], [1]; this approach identiﬁes R&D units that have
had (and have not had) gross impact on the user community. However, as we
have already mentioned, this abscence of ﬁne-structure represents a limited per-
spective; therefore, we require an approach that utilizes all the available citing
data and could help answer questions such as:

What types of people and organizations are citing the research outputs; is

this the desired target audience?

What development categories are citing the research outputs?
What technical disciplines are citing the research outputs?
What are the relationships between the citing technical disciplines and the

cited technical disciplines?

The aim of the present study is to show the power and capability of this new
phenomenological approach to citer proﬁling. It is necessary to stress that the
aim is not to assess the productivity and magnitude of impact of any individual
researcher, research group, laboratory, institution, or country. To perform such
an assessment, the authors would need a charter and statistically representative
data based on the unit of assessment, i.e. to make a portrait of the research
impact according with the current available scientiﬁc databases.

The organization of this paper is the following: In the second section, we
summarize the methodology, and describe citation mining. In the third section,
we present the results of analyzing four sets of papers. In the following we will
refer to these papers as cited papers, in order to distinguish them from the
citing papers that are the papers in which the cited papers are referenced. We
proﬁle the four selected paper sets through the analysis of the characteristics
of the citing authors, journals where the citing papers appeared, references in
the citing papers, and also through the analysis of linguistic correlations in the
abstract of the cited and citing papers as well as the titles and the keywords,

3

and other registers available in the SCI database. Finally, we conclude with
some remarks on the present study.

2 METHOD

In this section we describe a simple procedure to incorporate much of the SCI
information in the analysis of the impact of scientiﬁc papers. First, we identify
the types of data contained in the SCI (circa early 2000), and the types of
analyses that will be performed on this information (see Table 1).

Table 1 shows a record from the SCI, without the ﬁeld tags. The actual
paper that it represents is referred in the following description as the ’full paper’.
Starting from the top, the individual ﬁelds are:

be a diﬃcult ﬁeld to interpret accurately.
Diﬀerent authors from the same organi-
zational unit may describe their organiza-
tional level diﬀerently. Diﬀerent authors
may abbreviate the same organizational
unit diﬀerently.

Before proceeding further, we deﬁne the overall study objectives, followed by

4

the approach chosen. The purpose is to identify the infrastructure and technical
characteristics of the citing community, by stratiﬁed categories. The approach
is to perform bibliometric analysis of the citing papers to identify the infras-
tructure, text mining (extraction of useful information from text using compu-
tational linguistics mainly) of the citing papers to identify the main technical
themes and their relationships, and then integrate the bibliometrics and text
mining results to obtain a uniﬁed picture of the citing community.

Speciﬁcally, we want to present a summary analysis of the citing paper infor-
mation. This establishes boundaries on the population to be cited, the ﬁelds of
the cited records to be analyzed, and the statistical requirements for the citing
population. The population to be cited could be (and is) an individual paper,
the papers from a single author, the papers from an organizational unit, the
papers from a technical discipline, the papers from a country, and/ or various
combinations of the above. The key ﬁelds of the citing records will be analyzed.
Title record is used in text mining together with the other unstructured text
ﬁelds, Abstracts and Keywords, to perform the correlation analysis of the themes
in the cited paper to those of the citing papers. Computational linguistics
analysis is then performed.

Author records used to obtain multi-author distribution proﬁles could be
computed (e.g., number of papers with one author, number with two authors,
etc.).

Counts in Source ﬁeld can lead to journal name distributions, theme distri-

butions, and development level distributions.

Document Type register allows distributions of diﬀerent document types to

be computed (e.g., three articles, four conference proceedings, etc.)

Language ﬁeld allows distributions over languages to be computed.
Cited References allows a historical analysis of the problem to be performed,
and this ﬁeld can be used to analyze the interrelations between diﬀerent groups
working on related problems.

Times Cited register would be important if the citing papers are of suﬃ-
cient vintage. Then their multiplier eﬀect would be of interest, and could be
computed. The distribution proﬁle of times cited of the citing paper would be
generated.

The Addresses register allows distributions of names and types of institu-
tions, and countries, to be generated.
Institution and country combinations
would be of special interest, and could be correlated with author combination
distributions.

The present demonstration of citation mining includes a comparison of a
cited research unit from a developing country with a cited research unit from
a developed country. It also compares a cited unit from a basic research ﬁeld
with a cited unit from an applied research ﬁeld. Speciﬁcally, the technique
is being demonstrated using selected papers from a Mexican semiconductor
applied research group (MexA), a United States semiconductor applied research
group (USA), a British fundamental research group (BriF), and a United States
fundamental research group (USF) (see Table 2). These papers were selected
based on the authors’ familiarity with the topical matter, and the desire to

5

examine papers that are reasonably cited. Here, we select these analyzed sets
considering at least 50 external cites in order to have a good phenomenological
description.

In addition, selection and banding of variables are key aspects of the bib-
liometric study. While speciﬁc variable values are of interest in some cases
(e.g., names of speciﬁc citing institutions), there tends to be substantial value
in meta-level groupings (e.g., institution class, such as government, industry,
academia). Objectives of the study are to demonstrate important variables,
types of meta-level groupings providing the most information and insight, and
those conditions under which non-dimensionalization become useful. However,
we present also two analyses at the micro-level involving speciﬁc correlations
between both citing author and references for BriF and USF papers. This lat-
ter analysis is directly important for the performers of scientiﬁc research. In
addition, text mining could be performed on the text ﬁelds (mainly the Ab-
stract, but including the Title and Keywords) to supplement the analysis on
the semi-structured and structured ﬁelds.

3 RESULTS

This section presents the bibliometric and text mining results, showing the ad-
vantages and broad perspectives oﬀered by these techniques, both alone and
combined. The results are presented in graph and tabular forms. In order to
organize the presentation, we divide our results into bibliometrics and textmin-
ing analysis.

3.1 Bibliometrics Analysis

Figure 1 contains a bar graph of multi-author distribution for the four sets an-
alyzed. The ordinate represents the fraction of total papers published in each
author band, and the abscissa represents the number of authors per paper. The
most striking feature of this graph is the behavior at the wings. The papers
citing basic research dominate the low end (single author), while the papers
citing applied research dominate the high end (6-7 authors). The papers citing
basic research (BriF and USF) have a similar number of authors per paper, with
a maximum in the frequency distribution at two authors per paper. The USA
citing papers show gaussian-like authorship distribution with three and four au-
thors per paper, while the MexA group citing papers show a distribution similar
to the groups citing fundamental research papers but with fewer single-author
papers. These four sets show author distributions where 90% of the papers had
less than six authors. These results conﬁrm the diversity of collaborative group
compositions over diﬀerent disciplines and levels of development.

Generally, as projects become more applied, they tend to become larger
and more expensive, and require more resources. They also usually require the
integration of multiple disciplines. Both these characteristics typically result
in larger research groups, and hence in more contributors to a project and its
resulting documents. Experimental work usually involves larger teams than
theoretical work, while modeling and simulation activities tend to allow more
individual eﬀorts. The strong experimental emphasis of the two applied semi-
conductor groups, with little evidence of computer simulation shown, results in
large teams on average. The more balanced theory/ experiment combination of
the basic research group tends to suppress larger team eﬀorts in favor of more
individualized research. In addition, the intrinsic nature of sandpile vibration
research, as opposed to elementary particle or fusion research, does not require
large facilities and large research teams.

The citing journal discipline frequency is shown in Table 3. Clearly, each
paper set has deﬁned its main discipline well. Also, there is a symmetry in
the cross citing disciplines. USF and BriF groups were cited around 80% in
fundamental journals (Phys, Bio, Chem) and close to 10% in applied journals
(Environ, Mate, Eng.). Similarly, MexA and USA groups were cited close to
50% in applied journals and 45% in fundamental journals. These journal disci-
pline results suggest that the applications developed by the MexA group have
a stronger impact on chemical journals than those of the USA group, while the
applications developed by the USA have a group stronger impact on physics
journals than those of the MexA group. A point to be stressed is that only the
fundamental papers received cites in journals clearly outside of their disciplines.

The discipline distribution of the citing papers, produced by analyzing the
papers’ Abstracts and Titles, is shown in Table 4. It is slightly diﬀerent from
Table 3. As concluded in the text mining, these free-text ﬁelds provide far more
precise information than can be obtained from the journal discipline. Multi-
disciplinary journals can publish uni-disciplinary papers from many diﬀerent
disciplines. Also, the journal categories, determined by ISI, are not a unique
reﬂection of speciﬁc contents (e.g., an environmental journal can accept engi-
neering papers, a materials journal can accept physics papers, etc.).

In three of the four sets analyzed, the component papers were published in
diﬀerent years (see Figure. 2). The MexA set was published from 1989 to 1994,
USA from 1994 to 1995, BriF from 1989 to 1996, while USF includes only one
paper published in 1992. Figure 2 shows a clear oscillating behavior of USA and
BriF, due partly to the diﬀerent dates of paper publication. Also, most of the
sets have between 10% and 20% of cites per year, while the USA set received
38% of the cites in 1998.

The single highly-cited paper feature of the USF set allows additional anal-
yses and perspectives. In Figure 3, the USF citing paper disciplines are shown
as a function of time. As time evolves, citing papers from disciplines other than
those of the cited paper emerge. An important point is the four-year delay
of the systematic appearance of application/development citing papers, but no
delay for extra-discipline research citing papers.

Table 5 shows that most cites appear in articles. The four analyzed sets are
cited in review articles and letters. This indicates the relevance of the analyzed
papers. One important point is that only the fundamental papers are cited in
notes, and only the USF paper was cited in an editorial document.

Table 6 shows that English is the dominant language of all the paper sets
analyzed. However, the surprising appearance of a signiﬁcant number of citing
papers written in Romanian for the MexA set indicates that MexA’s work is
important for at least one developing country.

Figure 4 shows the proﬁle of the citing institutions. Clearly, academia has the
highest citing rates. Industry references the advance of high-technological devel-
opments, but is not referencing directly the advances in fundamental research.
Research Centers follow applied and fundamental research about equally. Direct
government participation is not signiﬁcant in the ﬁelds studied. Government/
national laboratories were classiﬁed under research centers.

There are 44 countries represented in the citing paper sets analyzed. Figure
5 shows only those countries with at least 10% of the citing countries for a set.
USA has the most cites in aggregate. India has the largest cites of the MexA
set; Japan has the largest cites of the USA set. This fact is due to the diﬀerent
nature of the applied technology developed by MexA and USA. The USA set
contains work related to high technology (high eﬃciency photovoltaic cells), and
the MexA set is dedicated to explore low-cost technology (low cost photovoltaic
thin ﬁlms). Therefore, this last set is cited by the less aﬄuent countries of
India, Romania and Mexico. India and Mexico also cite fundamental research,
but not Romania. It is important to stress that if no low-cost technology papers
were considered, these latter countries would not appear in this graph, and only
developed countries would appear. Another point is that England does not cite
USA works.

Figure 6 shows clearly that the low-cost technology papers are cited by de-
veloping countries. Developed countries cite the mostly high-technology papers,
there exist a clear asymmetry in the interests and of course the number of cites
from developing countries is less than cites from developed ones.

The analysis of the most common citing authors is presented in Figures 7
where the frequency of an author citing USF (triangle) or BriF (square) is plot-
ted. Figure 7 shows that there is a closed relation between the citing authors
for both BriF and USF groups, actually there is a common citing author who
occupied the highest position in the frequency plot in both sets (Hermann, HJ).

9

Three of the highest citing authors are not shared between the citing sets of
USF and BriF. Jaeger and Nagel are the authors of the USF paper and Mehta
is one of the authors of BriF paper. They maintain awareness of each other’s
work. In contradistinction, Figure 8 shows that MexA and USA have no inter-
section between their topics (low cost photovoltaic thin ﬁlms and high eﬃciency
photovoltaic cells, respectively), from the perspective of the highest citing au-
thors. Previous citation results have shown that applied research authors tend
to cite more fundamental research, along relatively stratiﬁed lines. In Figure 8,
it is clear that the maximum citing author of the MexA group is a Romanian
researcher.

In Figure 9, it is clear that there are common features in the number of
references in those papers that cite the core applied and fundamental papers, but
there are also some diﬀerences. For instance, at the lower end of the spectrum
(0-20), the applied papers’ citing papers dominate. At the higher end of the
spectrum (21-50+), the fundamental papers’ citing papers dominate, with the
exception of the BriF anomaly at 41-50.

There are many possible reasons for these diﬀerences, and separating out the
eﬀects is complex. There are two diﬀerent technical disciplines, and each one has
its citing culture and traditions. Also, each technical discipline has a diﬀerent
level of research activity, and this could inﬂuence the magnitude of citations
generated. Basic researchers tend to document more, and therefore produce a
larger literature to cite. Finally, there may be diﬀerent citing practices in basic
and applied research.

Frequency analysis of the most common references in the citing papers pro-
vides insight to co-cited papers, and allows a historical perspective to be ob-
tained. The reference-frequency for the USF and BriF citing papers is shown
in Figure 10. Here we see that the fundamental papers dealing with sand-piles
are actually correlated, because the highest occurring references in their citing
papers are common references (each line has two symbols).

In Figure 10 also we observed that Faraday’s work (1831) appears within
the twenty papers most cited in the USF and BriF citing papers. This indicates
the fundamental and seminal character of the experimental work performed by
Faraday. Also, Reynolds’ work (1885) appears within the twenty most cited
papers in the references of the BriF set. These two references also indicate the
longevity of the unsolved problems tackled by the USF and BriF groups. The
highest frequency co-cited papers have three interesting characteristics. They
are essentially all in the same general physics area, they are all published in
fundamental science journals (mainly physics), and they are all relatively recent,
indicating a dynamic research area with high turnover.

The corresponding analysis of the most common references in the applied
MexA and USA groups is presented in Figure 11. These two groups have no
correlations, because they have no common references between the highest oc-
curring references in their citing papers. However, in the detailed analysis of
the correlation there is one paper in the intersection of these two groups.

This ends the bibliometric analysis. The following section illustrates the

usefulness of text mining analysis.

10

3.2 Text mining

The purpose of the text mining is to perform trans-citation linguistic pattern
analyses, and make trans-citation comparisons. Two text mining techniques
will be used for the following analyses. Phrase frequency analysis will be used
to identify the main technical themes of the citing papers relative to the cited
papers. Phrase proximity analysis, mainly phrase clustering and taxonomy gen-
eration, will be used to show the relationships among themes and category
structures of the overall technical citing disciplines. The ﬁndings for each of the
four paper groups are summarized. Phrase frequency results are presented for
the ﬁrst three groups, and, in addition, phrase clustering results are presented
for the fourth group.

3.2.1 USA

The highest frequency single, adjacent double, and adjacent triple word phrases
from its USA citing papers aligned with the themes of the cited paper can be
seen in del Rio et al. [4].

The central themes and speciﬁc phrases used in the cited paper are replicated
in the citing papers. There were no phrases in the citing papers that represented
themes or disciplines signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from those in the cited paper, above
a frequency of unity. While there could possibly be phrases representative of
diﬀerent themes with a unity frequency, some minimal theme coherence was
desired. The citing readership appears to be strongly concentrated in the the-
matic areas of the cited paper. One suspects that the audience obtained is the
target audience for this paper, at least in terms of thematic interest. We could
not ﬁnd phrases reﬂecting themes other than cited paper.

3.2.2 MexA

The central themes and speciﬁc phrases used in the cited paper are replicated in
the citing papers. There were two phrases in the citing papers that represented
themes or disciplines other than those in the cited paper, above a frequency of
unity (See Table 7). These additional themes reﬂected use of the solar coatings
for automobile windows, in addition to the core architectural (building) applica-
tions. This is a very small extrapolation. Again, the citing readership appears
to be strongly concentrated in the thematic areas of the cited paper.

Use of text mining capabilities, such as computational linguistics, allows only
those applications and extra-discipline papers of interest to be identiﬁed, and
the requisite information can then be obtained from reading the Abstracts. In
addition, the computational linguistics provides a structure and categorization
of these myriad applications, allowing the larger context of application themes
to be displayed and understood. While phrase frequency algorithms were used
for the present study, and proved adequate, speciﬁcally-tailored co-occurrence
and clustering algorithms are being developed to improve the eﬃciency of the
application papers identiﬁcation and retrieval process, see Table 8.

3.2.4 USF

The citing papers to USF paper representing diﬀerent categories of development
and diﬀerent disciplines from those of the cited paper are portrayed graphically
in Figure 12, the axes are Category, Alignment and Papers. The Category
represents the level of development characterized by the citing paper (1=ba-
sic research; 2=applied research; 3=advanced development/ applications), and
the alignment represents the degree of similarity between the main themes of
the citing and cited papers (1=strong alignment; 2=partial alignment; 3=little
alignment). There are three interesting features on Figure 12. First, the tail of
total annual citation counts is very long, and shows little sign of abating, this
is one characteristic feature of a seminal paper. Second, the fraction of extra-
discipline basic research citing papers to total citing papers ranges from about
20-40% annually, with no latency period evident. This instant extra-disciplinary

12

diﬀusion may have been due to the combination of intrinsic broad-based appli-
cability of the subject matter and publication of the paper in a high-circulation
science journal with very broad-based readership. Third, there was a four-year
latency period before the higher development category citing papers began to
emerge. One can see that black dots (earlier cites) are completely in the cate-
gory. This correlates with the results from the bibliometrics component. The
latency could have been due to the information remaining in the basic research
journals, and not reaching the applications community, or the time that an ap-
plication needs to be developed is of the order of four years. Thus, the basic
science publication feature that may have contributed heavily to extra-discipline
citations may also have limited higher development category citations for the
latency period.

The present phenomenological approach of identifying impact themes through
text mining allows a much more detailed and informative picture of the impact
of research to be obtained compared to semi-automated journal classiﬁcation
comparison approaches [3]. It represents the diﬀerence between stating that a
”Physics paper impacted Geology research” and a ”paper focused on sand-pile
avalanches for surface smoothing impacted analyses of steep hill-slope land-
slides”.

In the ﬁnal data analysis, a taxonomy of the USF citing papers was gener-
ated using phrase clustering. The Abstracts of all the USF citing papers were
converted to phrases and their frequencies of occurrence with use of a Natu-
ral Language Processor contained in the TechOasis software package. The 153
highest frequency technical content phrases (expert-selected) were exported to
a statistical clustering software package (WINSTAT). Based on the relations
among phrases generated by this package, a taxonomy was generated by the au-
thors. A particularly helpful output for each clustering run was the dendogram,
a tree-like diagram showing the structural branches that deﬁne the clusters.
Figure 13 is one dendogram based on the 48 highest frequency phrases (for il-
lustration purposes only). The abscissa contains the phrases that are clustered.
The ordinate is a distance metric. The smaller the distance at which phrases, or
phrase groups, are clustered, the closer is the connection between the phrases.
Thus, samples of the phrases combined, near the right hand end of the
graph include DISSIPATION, COLLISIONS and ENERGY, and MIXTURES/
ALTERNATING LAYERS/ SMALL GRAINS/ LARGE GRAINS/ STRATI-
FICATION. In the middle part of the graph VIBRATION and AMPLITUDE
can be found. At some later time, the VIBRATION-AMPLITUDE combination
is grouped with the GRAVITY-GRANULAR MEDIA combination to form the
next hierarchical level grouping, and so on.

Many statistical agglomeration techniques for clustering were tested; the Av-
erage Neighbor method appeared to provide reasonably consistent good results.
Analyses were performed of the numerous cluster options that were produced.
The following is one of the top-level cluster descriptions that represented the
results of the phrase and word lists clustering best, as well as the factor matrix
clustering from the TechOasis results (more clusters can be found in Kostoﬀ et
al. [8]).

13

The highest level categorization based on the highest frequency 153 phrases
produced three distinct clusters [8]: Structure/ Properties, Flow-Based Experi-
ments, Modeling and Simulation. In the description of the Structure and Prop-
erties cluster (right part of the dendogram Figure 13) that follows, phrases that
appeared within the clusters will be capitalized.

This cluster contained MIXTURES of LARGE GRAINS and SMALL GRAINS,

with STRATIFICATION along ALTERNATING LAYERS based on SIZE SEG-
REGATION and grain SHAPE and GEOMETRICAL PROFILE. The MIX-
TURE forms a PILE with an ANGLE of REPOSE. When the ANGLE of RE-
POSE is LARGER than a critical ANGLE, DYNAMICAL PROCESSES pro-
duce AVALANCHES, resulting in SURFACE FLOW within THIN LAYERS.

4 CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we have presented a phenomenological technique to analyze some
aspects of a complex system like the multi-path non-monotonic impact of sci-
entiﬁc research. The result of using citation mining (bibliometrics and text
mining) to analyze the impact of science, through the use of the available infor-
mation from the Web of Science ISI, allows the proﬁling of the citing papers of a
given paper, research group, scientiﬁc organization, etc. We illustrated citation
mining through the analysis of four research groups. This analysis provided mul-
tiple facets and perspectives of the myriad impacts of research. Citation mining
oﬀers insights that would not emerge if only separate citing paper counts were
used independently, as is the prevalent use of citation analysis today. More-
over, by removing the need to actually read thousands of abstracts through
the use of text mining, comprehensive assessments of research impact become
feasible. One important result from the basic research citation mining [8] was
that impacts are possible in myriad ﬁelds and applications not envisioned by
the researchers. This reference also questioned whether fundamental sand-pile
research would receive funding from Tokamak, air traﬃc control, or materials
programs, even though sand-pile research could impact these or many other
types of applications, as shown in the paper. The reference concluded that
sponsorship of some unfettered research must be protected, for the strategic
long-term beneﬁts on global technology and applications!

Figure 4. Institution proﬁle of citing papers. Most of the research related

to these two ﬁelds is perfomed in academic institutions.

Figure 5. Country proﬁle of citing papers. The main objective in the MexA
research is to obtain a low cost technology, this marks the countries interested
in this kind of work.

Figure 6. Citing country development phase. In this graph we are plotting
the relative number of citing countries according to their development phase.
Each axis indicates the ratio between developed or developing citing countries
and the total number of citing countries to each group. Lines are drawn in
order to guide the eye and group the diﬀerent origins of the citing papers. In
the fundamental groups, the diﬀerence between the number of papers produced
in developed and developing countries is clear. USF, USA and BriF receive
more cites from developed countries than from developing ones. However, note
that again the topic of low cost technology is more interesting for developing
countries.

Figure 7. Correlation between the citing authors in fundamental sets. One

line with two symbols (triangle and square) means close relation.

Figure 8. Correlation between the citing authors in applied groups. Here,

there is no close relation.

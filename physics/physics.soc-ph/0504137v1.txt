1 Introdution

A ma jor researh fous in eonomis and eonophysis is on the distribution of wealth in soieties

at di(cid:27)erent stages of development. Wealth inludes money, material goods and assets of di(cid:27)erent

kinds. Knowledge of the monetary equivalent of the latter two omponents is required in order

to quantify wealth. A related and easier to measure distribution is that of inome. The ma jor

motivation of theoretial models is to provide insight on the mirosopi origins of inome/wealth

distributions. Suh distributions are expeted to provide good (cid:28)ts to the empirial data. In the

2

ontext of inomes, Champernowne

has ommented "The fores determining the distribution of

inomes in any ommunity are so varied and omplex and interat and (cid:29)utuate so ontinuously,

that any theoretial model must either be unrealistially simpli(cid:28)ed or hopelessly ompliated."

The statement highlights the desirability of (cid:28)nding a middle ground between the unrealistially

simple and the hopelessly ompliated.

A number of distribution funtions has been proposed so far to desribe inome and wealth

distributions. Theoretial models based on stohasti proesses, have been formulated to explain

the origins of some of the distributions

. One proposed distribution, mention of whih is found

1-7

8-9

in eonomi literature, is the beta distribution

. In this paper, we desribe a simple stohasti

model of wealth distribution and show that the beta distribution is obtained in the non-equilibrium

steady state.

2 Stohasti model

In the model, eah eonomi agent (an be an individual, a family or a ompany) may be in two

states: inative (E) and ative (E

). We determine the probability distribution of the wealth of

*

an agent randomly seleted from a population of agents. Let the agent possess wealth M at time
t. Inrease in the wealth of the agent an our in two ways: at a steady rate and at random time
intervals. In state E, the agent's wealth inreases at rate bm and in state E
by bm + jm . In both E and E
, the agent's wealth dereases at rate kmM . The deay rate is
proportional to the urrent wealth with km being the deay rate onstant. Transitions between

, the rate is given

*

*

the states E and E

our at random time intervals. The rate of hange of wealth is governed by

*

the equation

dM
dt

= jmz + bm − kmM = f (M, z)

(1)

(E). Let pj(M, t) (j = 0, 1) be the probability
where z = 1 (0) when the agent is in the state E
density funtion for wealth distribution when z = j . The rate of hange of the probability density

*

is given by

∂pj(M, t)
∂t

∂
∂M

Xk6=j

= −

[f (M, z)pj(M, t)] +

[Wkj pk(M, t) − Wjkpj(M, t)]

(2)

where Wkj is the transition rate from state k to state j . The (cid:28)rst term in Eq.(2) is the (cid:16)transport(cid:17)

term representing the net (cid:29)ow of probability density and the seond term represents the gain/loss

in the probability density due to random transitions between the state j and the other aessible
state. One an de(cid:28)ne the ativation and deativation rates, ka and kd respetively, to be ka = W01 ,
and kd = W10. From Eq. (2),

∂p0
∂t

∂
∂M

∂p1
∂t

∂
∂M

= −

{(bm − kmM )p0} + kdp1 − kap0

= −

{(jm + bm − kmM )p1} + kap0 − kdp1

with p = p0 + p1 . The minimum and the maximum amounts of wealth possessed by the agent are
given by Mmin = bm/km and Mmax = (bm+jm)/km . De(cid:28)ne m = M/Mmax , mmin = Mmin/Mmax ,
r1 = ka/km and r2 = kd/km . In the steady state, ∂p0/∂t = 0 and ∂p1/∂t = 0. The steady state

solution turns out to be the beta distribution

p(m, r1, r2) =

(m − mmin)r1−1(1 − m)r2−1
B(r1, r2)(1 − mmin)r1+r2−1

The normalization onstant B(r1, r2) is

B(r1, r2) =

1

Z

mmin

(m − mmin)r1−1(1 − m)r2−1
(1 − mmin)r1+r2−1

dm

In Eqs. (5) and (6), r1 > 0, r2 > 0 and mmin < m < 1. Let mmin = 0 and r1 > 1 and r2 > 1. In

this ase,

is the well-known beta funtion. The mean wealth mav and the variane mvar are given by

B(r1, r2) =

Γ(r1)Γ(r2)
Γ(r1 + r2)

mav =

, mvar =

r1
r1 + r2

r1r2
(r1 + r2)2

1
r1 + r2 + 1

The quantities depend on the ratios r1 and r2 rather than on the individual values of ka , kd and
km .

3 Results and disussion

Soieties are traditionally divided into three lasses: poor, middle and rih. Figs. 1(a), (b), and

() show the p(m) versus m distributions in the three ases. One an obtain similar urves when
mmin 6= 0. The Gini oe(cid:30)ient G, a measure of wealth inequality, is expeted to be small for eah
separate lass. For example, G = 0.2 in the ase of Fig. 1(a) desribing wealth distribution for

the poor lass. The two-parameter beta distribution is (cid:29)exible and an take a variety of shapes.

The preision in (cid:28)tting data is, however, limited in this ase.

have proposed a (cid:28)ve-parameter generalised beta distribution

distribution (mmin = 0) with b = 1. GG refers to the generalised gamma distribution. The
speial ases of GB(y), GB1 and GB2 have been shown to outperform other distributions in

providing good quantitative (cid:28)ts to the inome data from various ountries and segments of

soiety. The beta distribution, onsidered in the paper, is a speial ase of GB1.

In this paper, we have provided a stohasti model of wealth distribution leading to the beta

distribution in the non-equilibrium steady state.

It will be of interest to formulate stohasti

models of generalised beta distributions GB , GB1 and GB2. An understanding of the mirosopi

origins of inome/wealth distributions may provide insight on the poliies required to ensure that

the bene(cid:28)ts of eonomi growth reah all setions of soiety.

Abstract

We analyze the data on personal income distribution from the Australian Bureau
of Statistics. We compare ﬁts of the data to the exponential, log-normal, and gamma
distributions. The exponential function gives a good (albeit not perfect) description
of 98% of the population in the lower part of the distribution. The log-normal and
gamma functions do not improve the ﬁt signiﬁcantly, despite having more param-
eters, and mimic the exponential function. We ﬁnd that the probability density at
zero income is not zero, which contradicts the log-normal and gamma distributions,
but is consistent with the exponential one. The high-resolution histogram of the
probability density shows a very sharp and narrow peak at low incomes, which we
interpret as the result of a government policy on income redistribution.

1 Introduction

The study of income distribution has a long history. More than a century
ago, Pareto [1] proposed that income distribution obeys a universal power
law, valid for all time and countries. Subsequent studies found that this con-
jecture applies only to the top 1÷3% of the population. The question of what
is the distribution for the majority (97÷99%) of population with lower in-
comes remains open. Gibrat [2] proposed that income distribution is governed
by a multiplicative random process resulting in the log-normal distribution.
However, Kalecki [3] pointed out that such a log-normal distribution is not
stationary, because its width keeps increasing with time. Nevertheless, the
log-normal function is widely used in literature to ﬁt the lower part of income

distribution [4,5,6]. Yakovenko and Dr˘agulescu [7] proposed that the distri-
bution of individual income should follow the exponential law analogous to
the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution of energy in statistical physics. They found
substantial evidence for this in the statistical data for USA [8,9,10,11]. Also
widely used is the gamma distribution, which diﬀers from the exponential one
by a power-law prefactor [12,13,14]. For a recent collection of papers discussing
these distributions, see the book [15].

Distribution of income x is characterized by the probability density function
(PDF) P (x), deﬁned so that the probability to ﬁnd income in the interval from
x to x+dx is equal to P (x) dx. The PDFs for the distributions discussed above
have the following functional forms:

The exponential distribution has one parameter T , and its P (x) is maximal
at x = 0. The log-normal and gamma distributions have two parameters each:
(m, s) and (β, α). They have maxima (called modes in mathematical statistics)
s2 and x = αβ, and their P (x) vanish at x = 0. Many researchers
at x = m e−
impose the condition P (0) = 0 a priori, “because people cannot live on zero
income”. However, this assumption must be checked against the real data.

In this paper, we analyze statistical data on personal income distribution in
Australia for 1989–2000 and compare them with the three functions in Eq. (1).
The data were collected by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) using
surveys of population. The anonymous data sets give annual incomes of about
14,000 representative individuals, and each individual is assigned a weight. The
weights add up to 1.3÷1.5×107 in the considered period, which is comparable
to the current population of Australia of about 20 million people. In the data
analysis, we exclude individuals with negative and zero income, whose total
weight is about 7%. These ABS data were studied in the previous paper [4],
but without weights and with the emphasis on the Pareto tail at high income.
Here we re-analyze the data in the middle and low income range covering
about 99% of the population, but excluding the Pareto tail. The number of
data points in the Pareto tail is relatively small in surveys of population, which
complicates accurate analysis of the tail.

2 Cumulative Distribution Function

In this Section, we study the cumulative distribution function (CDF) C(x) =
∞x P (x′) dx′. The advantage of CDF is that it can be directly constructed from
R
a data set without making subjective choices. We sort incomes xn of N indi-
viduals in decreasing order, so that n = 1 corresponds to the highest income,

2

n = 2 to the second highest, etc. When the individuals are assigned the weights
N
wn, the cumulative probability for a given xn is C =
k=1 wk, i.e.
C(x) is equal to the normalized sum of the weights of the individuals with
incomes above x. We ﬁt the empirically constructed C(x) to the theoretical
CDFs corresponding to Eq. (1)

To visualize C(x), diﬀerent scales can be used. Fig. 1(a) uses the log-linear
scale, i.e. shows the plot of ln C vs. x. The main panel in Fig. 1(b) uses the
linear-linear scale, and the inset the log-log scale, i.e. ln C vs. ln x. We observe
that the log-linear scale is the most informative, because the data points ap-
proximately fall on a straight line for two orders of magnitudes, which suggests
the exponential distribution. To obtain the best ﬁt in the log-linear scale, we
minimize the relative mean square deviation σ2 = 1

spaced between x = 0 and the income at which CDF is equal to 1%, i.e. we ﬁt
the distribution for 99% of the population. The minimization procedure was
implemented numerically in Matlab using the standard routines.

For the exponential distribution, the ﬁtting parameter T determines the
slope of ln C vs. x and has the dimensionality of Australian dollars per year,
denoted as AUD or simply $ (notice that 1 k$ = 103 $). T is also equal to the
average income hxi for the exponential distribution. The parameters m and

β for the log-normal and gamma distributions also have the dimensionality
of AUD, and the average incomes hxi for these two distributions are mes2/2
and βΓ(α + 2, 0)/Γ(α + 1, 0). The parameters s and α are dimensionless and
characterize the shape of the distributions. The values of these parameters,
obtained by ﬁts for each year, are given in Table 1. Using the values of T , we
plot C vs. x/T in Fig. 1. In these coordinates, the CDFs for diﬀerent years
(shown by diﬀerent symbols) collapse on a single curve for the lower 98% of
the population. The collapse implies that the shape of income distribution
is very stable in time, and only the scale parameter T changes in nominal
dollars. The three lines in Fig. 1 show the plots of the theoretical CDFs given
by Eq. (2). In these coordinates, the exponential CDF is simply a straight
line with the slope −1. For the plots of the log-normal and gamma CDFs,
we used the parameters s = 0.72, m/T = 0.88, α = 0.38, and β/T = 0.77
obtained by averaging of the parameters in Table 1 over the years. We observe
that all three theoretical functions give reasonably good, albeit not perfect,
ﬁts of the data with about the same quality, as conﬁrmed by the values of σ
in Table 1. Although the log-normal and gamma distributions have the extra
parameters s and α, the ﬁtting procedure selects their values in such a way
that these distributions mimic the exponential shape. Actually, we constructed
the gamma ﬁt only for 98% of the population, because the ﬁt for 99% gives
α = 0, i.e. the exponential. We conclude that the exponential distribution
gives a reasonable ﬁt of the empirical CDFs with only one ﬁtting parameter,
whereas the log-normal and gamma distributions with more ﬁtting parameters
do not improve the ﬁt signiﬁcantly and simply mimic the exponential shape.
However, by construction, C(x) is always a monotonous function, so one
may argue that diﬀerent CDFs look visually similar and hard to distinguish.
Thus, it is instructive to consider PDF as well, which we do in the next Section.

3 Probability Density Function

In order to construct P (x), we divide the income axis into bins of the width
∆x, calculate the sum of the weights wn of the individuals with incomes from
x to x+∆x, and plot the obtained histogram. However, there is subjectiveness
in the choice of the width ∆x of the bins. If the bins are too wide, the number
of individuals in each bin is big, so the statistics is good, but ﬁne details of the
PDF are lost. If the bins are too narrow, the number of individuals in each bin
is small, thus relative ﬂuctuations are big, so the histogram of PDF becomes
noisy. Eﬀectively, P (x) is a derivative of the empirical C(x). However, numer-
ical diﬀerentiation increases noise and magniﬁes minor irregularities of C(x),
which are not necessarily important when we are interested in the universal
features of income distribution. To illustrate these problems, we show PDFs
obtained with two diﬀerent bin widths in Fig. 2.

Fig. 2(a) shows the coarse-grained histogram of P (x) for all years with a
wide bin width ∆x/T ≈ 0.43. The horizontal axis represents income x rescaled
with the values of T from Table 1. The lines show the exponential, log-normal,
and gamma ﬁts with the same parameters as in Fig. 1. With this choice of the
bin width, the empirical P (x) is a monotonous function of x with the maximum
at x = 0, and the exponential function gives a reasonable overall ﬁt. The log-
normal and gamma ﬁts have maxima at x/T ≈ 0.56 and x/T ≈ 0.29. These
values are close to the bin width, so we cannot resolve whether P (x) has a
maximum at x = 0 or at a non-zero x within the ﬁrst bin.

Fig. 2(b) shows the PDF for the year 1994-95 with a narrow bin width ∆x =
1 k$, which corresponds to ∆x/T ≈ 0.05. This PDF cannot be ﬁtted by any of
the three distributions, because it has a very sharp and narrow peak at the low
income 7.3 k$, which is way below the average income of 19.6 k$ for this year.
This peak is present for all years, and its position is reported in the last column
of Table 1. The peak is so sharp and narrow that it cannot be attributed to
the broad maxima of the log-normal or gamma PDFs. We speculate that this

Fig. 2. The probability density function (PDF) of income distribution shown with
coarse-grained (a) and high (b) resolutions. The lines show ﬁts to diﬀerent theoret-
ical functions in Eq. (1).

peak occurs at the threshold income of some sort of government policy, such
as social welfare, minimal wage, or tax exemption. Comparing the empirical
PDF with the exponential curve, shown by the solid line, we infer that the
probability density above and below the peak is transferred to the peak, thus
creating anomalously high population at the special income.

We also studied how often diﬀerent income values occur in the data sets.
The most frequently reported incomes for diﬀerent years are always round
numbers, such as 15 k$, 20 k$, 25 k$, etc. This eﬀect can be seen in the
periodically spaced spikes in Fig. 2(b). It reﬂects either the design of the survey
questionnaires, or the habit of people for rounding their incomes in reporting.
In addition to the round numbers, we also ﬁnd the income corresponding
to the peak position among the ﬁve most frequently reported incomes. This
income, shown in the last column in Table 1, is not round and changes from
year to year, but sometimes stays the same. This again suggests that the sharp
peak in Fig. 2(b) is the result of a government-imposed policy and cannot be
explained by statistical physics arguments.

By deﬁnition, P (x) is the slope of C(x) with the opposite sign. Fig. 1 clearly
shows that the slope of C(x) at x = 0 is not zero, so P (x = 0) 6= 0. Fig. 2(b)
also shows that the probability density at zero income is not zero. In fact,
P (x = 0) is higher than P (x) for all other x, except in the narrow peak. The
non-vanishing P (x = 0) is a strong evidence against the log-normal, gamma,
and similar distributions, but is qualitatively consistent with the exponential
function. However, there is also substantial population with zero and negative
income, which is not described by any of these theories.

4 Discussion and Conclusions

All three functions in Eq. (1) are the limiting cases of the generalized beta
distribution of the second kind (GB2), which is also discussed in econometric
literature on income distribution [16]. GB2 has four ﬁtting parameters, and
distributions with even more ﬁtting parameters are considered in literature
[16]. Generally, functions with more parameters are expected ﬁt the data bet-
ter. However, we do not think that increasing the number of free parameters
gives a better insight into the problem. We think that a useful description of
the data is the one that has the minimal number of parameters, yet reasonably
(but not necessarily perfectly) agrees with the data. From this point of view,
the exponential function has the advantage of having only one parameter T
over the log-normal, gamma, and other distributions with more parameters.
Fig. 1(a) shows that log C vs. x is approximately a straight line for about
98% of population, although small systematic deviations do exist. The log-
normal and gamma distributions do not improve the ﬁt signiﬁcantly, despite
having more parameters, and actually mimic the exponential function. Thus
we conclude that the exponential function is the best choice.

The analysis of PDF shows that the probability density at zero income is

6

clearly not zero, which contradicts the log-normal and gamma distributions,
but is consistent with the exponential one, although the value of P (x = 0) is
somewhat lower than expected. The coarse-grained P (x) is monotonous and
consistent with the exponential distribution. The high resolution PDF shows
a very sharp and narrow peak at low incomes, which, we believe, results from
redistribution of probability density near the income threshold of a govern-
ment policy. Technically, none of the three function in Eq. (1) can ﬁt the
complicated, three-peak PDF shown in Fig. 2. However, statistical physics
approaches are intended to capture only the baseline of the distribution, not
its ﬁne features. Moreover, the deviation of the actual PDF from the theoret-
ical exponential curve can be taken as a measure of the impact of government
policies on income redistribution.

In this paper, we analyze web-downloaded data on people sharing their music library. By at-
tributing to each music group usual music genres (Rock, Pop...), and analysing correlations between
music groups of diﬀerent genres with percolation-idea based methods, we probe the reality of these
subdivisions and construct a music genre cartography, with a tree representation. We also show the
diversity of music genres with Shannon entropy arguments, and discuss an alternative objective way
to classify music, that is based on the complex structure of the groups audience. Finally, a link is
drawn with the theory of hidden variables in complex networks.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Take a sample of people, and make them listen to a
list of songs. If a majority of people should ﬁnd an agree-
ment on basic subdivisions, like Rock/Jazz/Pop..., a more
reﬁne description will lead to more and more disparate
answers, even contradictions. These originate from the
diﬀerent background, taste, music knowledge, mood or
network of acquaintances [1] of the listeners, i.e. in a sta-
tistical physics description, these processes correspond
to ageing, internal ﬂuctuations and neighbour-neighbour
interactions. The more and more eclectic music oﬀer, to-
gether with the constant mixing of old music genres into
new ones make the problem still more complicated. Even
artists seem to avoid the usual classiﬁcations by refus-
ing to enter well-deﬁned yokes, and prefer to characterise
themselves as a unique mix-up of their old inﬂuences [2].
Obviously, categorising music, especially into ﬁner gen-
res or subgenres, is not an easy task, and is strongly
subjective. This task is also complicated by the con-
stant birth of newly emerging styles, and by the very
large number of existing sub-divisions. For instance, the
genre Electronic music is divided in wikipedia [3] into 9
sub-genres (Ambient, Breakbeat...), each of them being
divided into several subsubgenres. This categorising is
becoming more and more complex in the course of time.
This paper tries to ﬁnd an answer to the above prob-
lems by showing in an ”objective” way the existence of
music trends that allow to classify music groups, as well
as the relations between the usual genres and sub-genres.
To do so, we use web-downloaded data from the web,
and deﬁne classiﬁcations based on the listening habits of
the groups audience. Thereby, we account for the fact
that music perception is driven both by the people who
make music (artists, Majors...), but also by the people
who listen to it. Our analysis consists in characterising
a large sample of individual musical habits from a sta-
tistical physics point of view, and in extracting collective

trends. In a previous work [4], we have shown that such
collective listening habits may lead to the usual music
subdivisions in some particular cases, but also to unex-
pected structures that do not ﬁt the neat usual genres
deﬁned by the music industry. Those represent the non-
conventional taste of listeners. Let us note that alter-
native music classiﬁcations based on signal analysis may
also be considered [5, 6].

In section II, we describe the methodology, namely
the analysis of empirical data from collaborative ﬁltering
websites, e.g. audioscrobbler.com and musicmobs.com.
We will also give a short review of the statistical meth-
ods introduced in [4]. Mainly, these methods consist in
evaluating the correlations between the groups, depend-
ing on their audience, and in using ﬁltering methods, i.e.
percolation idea-based (PIB) methods, in order to visu-
alise the collective behaviours. In section III, we attribute
lists of genres to a sample of music groups, by download-
ing data from the web. These data, that describe the
diﬀerent tags, i.e. genres, used by people to classify mu-
sic groups, are analysed by using the Shannon entropy
as a measure of the music group diversity. By examin-
ing correlations between these diﬀerent music genres, we
also use the statistical methods of section II in order to
make a map of music genres (see [7] for an example from
the social science). This cartography is justiﬁed by the
fact that alike music genres are statistically correlated
by their audience. It is shown that these correlations are
homophilic [8], i.e. alike music genres tend to be listened
to by the same audience. Homophily is known to occur
in many social systems, including online communities [9],
co-authorship networks [10, 11] and linking patterns be-
tween political bloggers [12].

Let us stress that the issues of this work are part of the
intense ongoing physicist research activity on opinion for-
mation [13, 14, 15, 16, 17], self organisation on networks
[18, 19], including clique formation [20], percolation tran-
sitions [21], as well as on the identiﬁcation of a priori
unknown collective behaviours in complex networks [22],
e.g. proteins [23], genes [24], linguistics [25, 26], indus-
trial sectors [27], groups of people [28]...

FIG. 1: Branching representation of a squared correlation
matrix of 13 elements. At each increasing step (t=0,1,2) of
the ﬁlter φ, links are removed, so that the network decom-
poses into isolated islands. These islands are represented by
squares, whose size depends on the number of nodes in the
island.
Islands composed by only one music group are not
depicted. Starting from the largest island, branches indicate
a parent relation between the islands. The increasing ﬁlter
method is applied until all links are removed.

II. METHODOLOGY

A. Data analysis

In this work, we analyze data retrieved from collab-
orative ﬁltering websites (see [29] for a detailed deﬁni-
tion). These sites propose people to share their proﬁles
and experiences in order to help them discover new mu-
that should (statistically) correspond to
sics/books...
their own taste.
In the present case, we focus on a
database downloaded from audioscrobbler.com in Jan-
uary 2005.
It consists of a listing of users (each rep-
resented by a number), together with the list of music
groups the users own in their library. This structure di-
rectly leads to a bipartite network for the whole system.
Namely, it is a network composed by two kinds of nodes,
i.e. the persons, called users or listeners in the following,
and the music groups. The network can be represented
by a graph with edges running between a group i and a
user µ, if µ owns i.

In the original data set, there are 617900 diﬀerent mu-
sic groups, although this value is skewed due to multi-
ple (even erroneous) ways for a user to characterise an
artist (e.g. The Beatles, Beatles and The Beetles count
as three music groups) and 35916 users. On average,
each user owns 140 music groups in his/her library, while
each group is owned by 8 persons. For completeness, let
us note that the listener with the most groups possesses
4072 groups (0.6% of the total music library) while the
group with the largest audience, Radiohead, has 10194

users (28% of the user community). This asymmetry in
the bipartite network is expected as users have in gen-
eral speciﬁc tastes that prevent them from listening to
any kind of music, while there exist mainstream groups
that are listened to by a very large audience. Let us stress
that this asymmetry is also observable in the degree dis-
tributions for the people and for the groups.

In the following, we make a selection in the total num-
ber of groups for computational reasons, namely we have
analysed a subset composed of the top 1000 most-owned
groups. This limited choice was also motivated by the
possibility to identify these groups at ﬁrst sight.

B. Percolation idea-based ﬁltering

In this section, we review the method introduced in
[4] in order to extract collective structures from the data
set. Each music group i is characterised by its signature,
i.e. the vector:

i

Γ

= (..., 1, ..., 0, ..., 1, ...)

(1)

of nL components, where nL = 35916 is the total number
of users in the system, and where Γi
µ = 1 if the listener
µ owns group i and Γi
µ = 0 otherwise. By doing so, we

consider that the audience of a music group, i.e. the list
of persons listening to it, identiﬁes its signature.

In order to quantify the correlations between two music
groups i and j, we calculate the symmetric correlation
measure:

Cij =

≡ cos θij

where Γ
denotes the scalar product between the two
nL-vector, and || its associated norm. This correlation
measure, that corresponds to the cosine of the two vectors
in the nL-dimensional space, vanishes when the groups
are owned by disconnected audiences, and is equal to 1
when their audiences strictly overlap.

In order to extract families of alike music groups from
the correlation matrix Cij , we use the PIB method [4].
We deﬁne the ﬁlter coeﬃcient φ ∈ [0, 1[, and ﬁlter the
matrix elements so that Cij
φ = 1 if Cij > φ, and let
Cij
φ = 0 otherwise. Starting from φ = 0.0, namely a
fully connected network, increasing values of the ﬁltering
coeﬃcient remove less correlated links and lead to the
shaping of well-deﬁned islands, completely disconnected
from the main island. Let us stress that this systematic
removal of links is directly related to percolation theory,
and that the internal correlations in the network displace
and broaden the percolation transition [4, 32]. From a
statistical physics point of view, the meaning of φ is that
of the inverse of a temperature, i.e. high values of φ
restrain the system to highly correlated islands; in the
same way, low temperature restrains phase space explo-
ration to low lying free energy wells. This observation
suggests that PIB methods should be helpful in visualis-
ing free energy proﬁles and reaction coordinates between
metastable states [30].

A branching representation of the community struc-
turing is used to visualise the process (see Fig.1 for the
sketch of three ﬁrst steps of an arbitrary example). To
do so, we start the procedure with the lowest value of
φ = 0.0, and we represent each isolated island by a square
whose surface is proportional to its number of nodes (the
music groups). Then, we increase slightly the value of
φ, e.g. by 0.01, and we repeat the procedure. From one
step to the next step, we draw a bond between emerg-
ing sub-islands and their parent island. The ﬁlter is in-
creased until all bonds between nodes are eroded (that
is, there is only one node left in each island). Let us note
that islands composed by only one music group are not
depicted, as these lonely music groups are self-excluded
from the network structure, whence from any genre. Ap-
plied to the above correlation matrix Cij , the tree struc-
ture gives some insight into the diversiﬁcation process by
following branches from their source (top of the ﬁgure)
toward their extremity (bottom of the ﬁgure). The longer
a given branch is followed, the more likely it is forming
a well-deﬁned music genre.

In [4], we have shown that the resulting tree represen-
tation exhibits long persisting branches, some of them

leading to standard, homogenous style groupings, such
as [Kylie Minogue, Dannii Minogue, Sophie Ellis Bextor]
(dance pop), while many other islands are harder to ex-
plain from a standard genre-ﬁcation point of view and
reveal evidence of unexpected collective listening habits.

III. GENRE CARTOGRAPHY

A. Measure of diversity

In view of the above analysis, attributing genres to mu-
sic groups is a diﬃcult problem. This complexity is made
clearer by observing the diﬀerent ways listeners charac-
terise the same music group. To perform this analysis,
we have downloaded from http://www.lastfm.com a list
of the descriptions, i.e. genres, that people tag to music
groups in their music library, together with the number
of times this description occurred. For instance, from
this site, one gets that ABBA (Fig.2a) is described by an
eclectic range of diﬀerent music sub-divisions. These sub-
divisions are based on the group style (Pop, Rock...), on
the time period (80s, 70s...) or on geographical grounds
(Swedish) and their choice depends on the listener, i.e.
his perception and subjective way to characterise music
(see ﬁrst paragraph of the introduction).

For this work, we have downloaded these lists of genres
for the top 1000 groups, thereby empirically collecting
a statistical genre-ﬁcation of the music groups. Let us
stress that the data could not be downloaded for 5 of
the groups, due to misprints in their name, e.g. Bjadrk
instead of Bj¨ork. Consequently, we focus in the following
on the nG = 995 remaining music groups. One should
also note that http://www.lastfm.com limits access to
the top 25 genres of each group.

The statistical genre-ﬁcation of the sample may ex-

The action of ﬁltering leads to a removal of less correlated links, thereby exhibiting the internal structure of the network. The

hibit quantitatively diﬀerent behaviours. For instance, a
music group like John Coltrane (Fig.2b) shows a peaked
histogram, i.e.
it is almost only described by the tag
jazz, in contrast with ABBA that is described by a large
variety of tags. In order to measure the complexity, or di-
versity of each music group i, we introduce the Shannon
entropy [33]:

irrelevant tags (due to to misprints for instance) and to
simplify our analysis, we restrict the scope to all music
genres that have been attributed to at least 20 music
groups. There are 142 such music genres, that we label
with index γ ∈ [1, 142]. Let us note Gγ this list of gen-
res, and Pi;γ their probability for the music group i. For
instance, these notations read as follows in the case of
John Coltrane:

Si = − X
i

pi;g ln pi;g

(3)

i

where pi;g is the probability for genre g to be tagged to
the music group i, and the sum is performed over all pos-
sible genres (with, as said before, a maximum of 25). By
construction, this quantity vanishes Smin
= 0 when the
group i is wholly described by one tag g∗, i.e. pi;g = δgg∗
while it takes its maximum value Smax
= ln 25 for the
uniform distribution pi;g = 1
25 . In order to restrain the
problem to the interval [0 : 1], we introduce the relative
quantity Ri = Si
ln 25 . This quantity is therefore represen-
tative of the number of diﬀerent terms needed by listen-
ers to describe the music group i, i.e. the diversity of
the music group. In ﬁgure 3, we plot the empirical dis-
tribution of this relative entropy over the 995 considered
groups. It shows clearly a high degree of diversity of the
music groups, therefore requesting many diﬀerent tags
for characterisation.

i

B. Genres correlations

In this section, we use the methods of section IIB in or-
der to analyse the correlations between genres attributed
to each music group i.
In the data set, we ﬁnd 2394
diﬀerent music genres. Nonetheless, in order to remove

G = [..., jazz, ..., saxophone, ..., f ree jazz, ...]

PJ.C. = [..., 0.72, ..., 0.06, ..., 0.02, ...]

(4)

In order to measure correlations between the 142 music
genres, we deﬁne the 142 × 142 correlation matrix M,
based on the correlations C between the music groups
(see Eq.2):

M γ1γ2 = Pi Pj6=i Cij Pi;γ1 Pj;γ2

N γ1γ2
where N is a normalisation matrix:

N γ1γ2 = X

X
j6=i

i

Pi;γ1 Pj;γ2

(5)

(6)

Practically, we make a loop over the nG(nG − 1) pairs of
diﬀerent music groups (i, j), each pair being characterised
by the correlation coeﬃcient Cij. For each of these pairs,
we evaluate all pairs of music genres γ1 and γ2 such that
Pi;γ1 6= 0 and Pj;γ2 6= 0, and increase the matrix element
M γ1γ2 by the quantity Cij Pi;γ1 Pj;γ2 . The normalisation
matrix element N γ1γ2 is itself updated by Pi;γ1 Pj;γ2 . At
the end of the loops, the correlation matrix is normalised:
M γ1γ2 → M γ1 γ2
N γ1 γ2 .

In order to reveal collective behaviours from the cor-
relation matrix M γ1γ2, we apply PIB methods. Starting

5

FIG. 5: Branching representation of the correlation matrix M γ1γ2 . The ﬁltering parameter φ ranges from 0.05 to 0.25 (from
top to bottom), and is increased at each step by 0.01 (the tree length is 20 steps) . It induces a snake of squares at each ﬁltering
level. The shape of the snake as well as its direction are irrelevant. The tree obviously shows the emergence of homogeneous
branches, that are composed of alike music-subdivisions, thereby showing evidence of genre families. The ﬁrst island extraction
occurs at φ = 0.1, and corresponds to a family of genres related to Japanese music: [japanese, jpop, j-rock]. Among the diﬀerent
structures uncovered by the method, let us note the appearance of the islands I1 (φ = 0.15), I2 (φ = 0.15) and I3 (φ = 0.18)
described in the main text.

at a very low value of the ﬁltering coeﬃcient (see Fig.4),
say φ = 0.09, the graph is fully connected.
Increasing
values of the ﬁltering coeﬃcient lead to the formation of
cliques and to the emergence of disconnected islands, as
those occurring in [4]. Finally, we plot in Fig.5 the tree
representation of the ﬁltering process. Poring over the
branches of this tree is very instructive and conﬁrms the
existence of non-trivial correlations between the diﬀer-
ent music genres. These correlations shape the relations
between genres, and give an objective deﬁnition to the
notion of sub-genre, genre family....

For instance (see Fig.5), one observes at φ = 0.15
the extraction of two large sub-islands, I1 and I2. I1
is composed of genres related to Post-Rock, Brit-Rock
and Trip-Hop: [chillout, ambient, trip hop, downtempo,

trip-hop, idm, post-rock, post rock, shoegaze, alt-country,
post-punk, indie pop, indie rock, lo-ﬁ, emusic, indie, folk,
brit rock, british, britpop, uk]. I2 is itself composed of
[hip hop, hiphop, hip-hop,
Hip-Hop and R&B genres:
gangsta rap, rap, us hiphop, r and b, rmb]. At φ = 0.16, a
small sub-island extracts from I1, composed of all British
related tags, thereby deﬁning a new sub-genre. Finally,
at φ = 0.17, I1 breaks into two separated blocks, one re-
lated to Rock music, the other related to Trip-Hop mu-
sic. Such a breaking also occurs for I2 at φ = 0.16, and
leads to a Hip-Hop sub-genre and a R&B sub-genre. Fi-
nally, let us note the punk-related island I3 emerging at
φ = 0.18.

Before concluding, one should insist on the homogene-
ity of the above sub-islands, i.e. their composition is ra-

tional given our a priori knowledge of music. This feature
highlights the homophily [8] of the music groups, which
means that similar groups, i..e. groups with similar tags,
tend to be listened by the same audience.

IV. CONCLUSION

In this article, we study empirically the musical be-
haviours of a large sample of persons. Our analysis is
based on web-downloaded data and uses complex net-
work techniques in order to uncover collective trends from
the data. To do so, we use percolation idea-based tech-
niques [4] that consist in ﬁltering correlation matrices, i.e.
correlations between the music groups, and in visualising
the resulting structures by a branching representation.
Each of the music groups is characterised by a list of
genres, that are tags used by the listeners in order to de-
scribe the music group. By studying correlations between
these tags, we highlight non-trivial relations between the
music genres. As a result, we draw a cartography of mu-
sic, where large structures are statically uncovered and
identiﬁed as a genre family. Let us stress that this work is
closely related to the theory of hidden variables [34, 35],
i.e. the hidden variables being here the music group tags.
Consequently, this study should provide an empirical test
for the theory.

This work has also many applications in marketing and
show business, e.g. taste suggestions in online services, in
publicity, libraries.... This kind of approach also opens
the way to quantitative modelling of opinion/taste for-
mation [36], and oﬀers quantitative tools for sociologists
and musicologists. For instance, G. d’Arcangelo [37] has
recently used our analysis in order to discuss the emer-
gence of a growing eclecticism of music listeners that is
driven by curiosity and self-identiﬁcation, in opposition
to the uniform trends promoted by commercial radios
and M ajor record labels [38]. Applications should also
be considered in taxonomy [39], in scientometrics, i.e.
how to classify scientiﬁc papers depending on their au-
thors, journal, year, keywords..., and in linguistics [40],
in order to highlight relations between a signiﬁer (tag)
and a signiﬁed (music group).

We propose a methodological framework to study the dynamics of inter-regional

investment ﬂow in Europe from a Complex Networks perspective, an approach with

recent proven success in many ﬁelds including economics. In this work we study the

network of investment stocks in Europe at two diﬀerent levels: ﬁrst, we compute the

inward-outward investment stocks at the level of ﬁrms, based on ownership shares

and number of employees; then we estimate the inward-outward investment stock at

the level of regions in Europe, by aggregating the ownership network of ﬁrms, based

on their headquarter location. Despite the intuitive value of this approach for EU

policy making in economic development, to our knowledge there are no similar works

in the literature yet. In this paper we focus on statistical distributions and scaling

laws of activity, investment stock and connectivity degree both at the level of ﬁrms

and at the level of regions. In particular we ﬁnd that investment stock of ﬁrms is

power law distributed with an exponent very close to the one found for ﬁrm activity.

On the other hand investment stock and activity of regions turn out to be log-normal

distributed. At both levels we ﬁnd scaling laws relating investment to activity and

connectivity. In particular, we ﬁnd that investment stock scales with connectivity in

a similar way as has been previously found for stock market data, calling for further

investigations on a possible general scaling law holding true in economical networks.

INTRODUCTION

In this work we study the network of investment stocks in Europe at two diﬀerent levels

of graining, a ﬁner and a coarser level. We start by studying the network of investment

stocks between individual ﬁrms and we then proceed to study the network of investment

stocks between European regions. At each level we focus on two speciﬁc aspects of such

networks: on one hand the statistical distributions of activity, investment stock and con-

nectivity degree. On the other, the scaling relations between such quantities.

In this

respect this work is related to previous ones in Complex Networks, in economic networks,

and also in scaling laws in industrial economics.

Several authors within the Complex Networks scientiﬁc community have started to

focus today on the geographical aspects of empirical networks like for instance the world

wide air traﬃc network [2, 13].

Closer to economics, some authors have studied the so called World Trade Web

(WTW), i.e. the network of import-export trade among countries in the world [7, 19].

Also, statistical properties of ownership networks have been studied so far only in a few

works, and in any case with no focus on geographical aspects. To name a few of the

works in this area, a study on the ﬁrm ownership network of Germany found it to exhibit

small world properties [15]. In the US stock markets, power law distribution of connec-

tivity degree and scaling relation between degree and invested volume have been found

[8]. However, it has been observed that network structures may diﬀer from each other in

terms of control concentration and still look similar from the point of view of the degree

distribution or the investment volume distribution [4].

In the economic literature, some works consider geographical embedding of economic

networks. It has been argued that domestic rivalry and geographic industry concentration

are especially important in creating dynamic clusters [16]. From a more general perspec-

tive, some authors assume the existence of a global world-economy in which, since its

inception in the sixteenth century, the periphery is assigned the function of supplying

the core with cheap labor and raw materials, while the core has the role of producing

manufactured goods, which require capital intensive high technology [22].

Statistical distributions in ﬁrm demography are well documented: ﬁrm size [1, 21], ﬁrm

growth [6], ﬁrm debts [10] have been studied in several countries and contexts. However,

The Network of Inter-Regional Direct Investment Stocks Across Europe

in general, interactions are poorly considered in empirical studies. Firms are not isolated,

but rather depend on the interaction with other ones through supply, ownership, part-

nership relations etc. Such relations should then play a role in the statistical properties

observed at a macroscopic scale. Also, there exists an interaction between ﬁrms and banks

through loans, and it has been found that the distribution of the so called ”bad debts”

(debts of ﬁrms towards the bank when they go bankrupt) is power-law distributed. An-

other type of interaction which is not well documented are the investment stocks of ﬁrms

in other ﬁrms. In this paper we ﬁnd a power law distribution for investment stock with an

exponent very close to the one found for ﬁrm activity (measured in number of employees,

see section II). Such a ﬁnding suggests a scaling law between investment and activity

that we also investigate and discuss. It is relevant to mention here the relationship be-

tween empirically observed macroscopic distributions and possible microscopic processes

that may be responsible for them.

In literature about the emerging of scaling laws in

ﬁrm demography, power law distributions are usually obtained as a result of a random

multiplicative process aﬀecting the size of each ﬁrm. Now, it is known from the works

of Kesten in the 70’ies that under some general conditions, a combination of random

multiplicative and additive process can give rise to power law distributions [14]. Even a

random multiplicative process with a lower reﬂecting barrier (representing for example a

bankruptcy threshold below which a ﬁrm disappears and a new one is created) gives rise

to a power law distribution. Instead, a pure random multiplicative process gives rise to

a log-normal distribution [20]. However, in all these processes, interaction between ﬁrms

is not considered. Among the few works addressing the issue, we mention one in which

a ﬁrm bankruptcy aﬀects indirectly other ﬁrms through the interest rate of the central

bank [11]. In this paper we start ﬁlling such gap by focusing on the distribution and the

scaling properties of investments of ﬁrms in other ﬁrms. Our aim is to contribute to the

understanding of how interdependency between ﬁrms gives rise to well deﬁned statistical

distributions both at the level of ﬁrms as at the level of regions.

A. Foreign Direct Investments and Inter-Regional Direct Investments

Concerning investment there is a tendency to study investment stocks or ﬂows between

countries, referred to as Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), without considering a higher

resolution. Contrary to this tendency, in this paper, we focus on investment stocks be-

tween regions of Europe, which can be referred to as Inter-Regional Direct Investment

(IRDI). In this sense, as discussed later, some concepts will be borrowed from the FDI

literature and applied in the IRDI context. The statistical characterization of the network

of IRDI stocks in Europe is a ﬁrst step towards relating investment ﬂow patterns at a

global level to local and regional dynamics.

FDI is deﬁned as ”investment that adds to, deducts from or acquires a lasting interest

in an enterprise operating in an economy other than that of the investor” the purpose

is to have an ”eﬀective voice in the management of the enterprise”, as equivalent to

holding 10% or more in the foreign enterprise [23]. Foreign aﬃliates are made up of

subsidiaries, associates, and branches. Subsidiaries are majority- or wholly-owned by the

parent companies. Associates are companies in which the investing ﬁrm participates in the

management but does not exercise control. Branches are permanent establishments set

up by the parent company in which there is no equity share capital apart from that of the

parent. For associates and subsidiaries, FDI ﬂows consist of the net sales of shares and

loans (including non-cash acquisitions made against equipment, manufacturing rights,

etc.)

to the parent company plus the parent ﬁrm’s share of the aﬃliate’s reinvested

earnings plus total net intra-company loans (short- and long-term) provided by the parent

company. For branches, FDI ﬂows consist of the increase in reinvested earnings plus the

net increase in funds received from the foreign direct investor. FDI ﬂows with a negative

sign (reverse ﬂows) indicate that at least one of the components in the above deﬁnition

is negative and not oﬀset by positive amounts of the remaining components. However,

the magnitude of FDI ﬂow can also be measured as number of jobs created or increased.

Contribution to more favorable employment status in the host country is critical when

evaluating FDI, especially for countries that are battling high unemployment rates or

want to increase the quality of their workforce. When quantifying FDI, ”ﬂow” (function

of time) and ”stock” (cross-sectional/cumulative) are measured and headquarter location

of the investor plays a critical role [16].

Due to standard legal, institutional and policy attributes that are common across a

given country it indeed makes sense to focus on FDI. However, nowadays ﬁrms may

perceive some regions in another country as more similar than regions within national

borders. This might be revealing that the process of European integration has reduced

the national speciﬁcities perceived by multinationals and that regions now are competing

to attract FDIs more across than within countries. Therefore it is important to gain insight

on investment ﬂows at a higher spatial resolution. In this paper we deﬁne Inter-Regional

Direct Investment (IRDI) ﬂow in analogy to FDI, as the ﬂow between two administratively

separated regions irrespective of their countries.

B. Relevance of FDI/IRDI for the Global Economy

Just like FDI, the study of IRDI has prominent policy making implications, in par-

ticular for governing bodies trying to tackle economic growth and employment creation

[24]. There are certain general factors that consistently determine which countries/regions

attract the most investment [5]. In particular, investors cite the following: market size

and growth prospects of the host, wage-adjusted productivity of labor, the availability of

infrastructures, reasonable levels of taxation and the overall stability of the tax regime.

Recent crises have magniﬁed perceptions of regulatory risks and greater attention is now

being focused on the legal framework and the rule of law. Thus the decision process

in investment is multi-factorial whereas the success or a higher productivity of the in-

vestment holds only when the host country/region has a minimum threshold stock of

human capital. Thus, investment contributes to economic growth only when a suﬃcient

absorptive capability of the advanced technologies is available in the host economy [17].

Promotional eﬀorts to attract investment have become the focal point of competition

among developed and developing countries. This competition is maintained even when

countries are pursuing economic integration at another level. And it also extends to the

sub-national level, with diﬀerent regional authorities pursuing their own strategies and

assembling their own basket of incentives to attract new investments. While some see

countries lowering standards to attract FDI in a ”race to the bottom,” others praise FDI

for raising standards and welfare in recipient countries. The targets for these promotional

The Network of Inter-Regional Direct Investment Stocks Across Europe

6

eﬀorts are dominantly the major players of FDI, namely the Transnational Corporations

(TNC’s) who on the other end push for newer markets (in the last decades the global

trend of privatization has been a very important mean towards this end). Public interest

driven policies meanwhile continue to serve as the balancing force, and sustainable de-

velopment concerns are dealt with accordingly. The EU has attracted over 40% of total

world ﬂows of FDI in the 1990s, becoming the largest recipient of multinational activity:

multinationals account for a growing share of gross ﬁxed capital formation in Europe

(from 6% in 1990 to over 50% in 2000). However, this increasing inﬂow of FDI in Europe

has not been equally distributed across countries and regions [3].

Now, while statistics are mostly regarded at the country-to-country scale, investments

are actually made in speciﬁc regions with geographic features, local administration con-

straints, and cultural proﬁle. There seem to be a substantial gap to ﬁll in understanding

what is the role of region-to-region investment ﬂow in the global economy. For this reason

we hereby propose to deﬁne the IRDI stock network and we investigate some of its sta-

tistical properties as a ﬁrst stage of a more comprehensive study to be continued in the

future. In section II we describe the data set analysed and discuss some methodological

issues. In section III we present and discuss the results of our analysis. In section V we

draw the conclusions and list some possible extensions of the present work.

II. DATA SETS AND METHODS

In this section we ﬁrst describe the content of the ﬁrm database we used for our

analysis. We then introduce the quantities we have measured on the data set and include

some methodological remarks.

For the ﬁrm information we used data collected in December 2004 from the Amadeus

database of Bureau Van Dijk. Access to the on-line service of Amadeus is costly and

was kindly granted by Prof. Delli Gatti of Universit`a Cattolica di Milano. The database

provides ﬁrm address, ﬁnancial proﬁle, number of employees, industrial classiﬁcation,

names of shareholders and board of directors of virtually all ﬁrms in Europe.

However data are delivered in ﬁles of limited size and we were forced to restrict the

download to a selection of the ensemble of ﬁrms. We have chosen to select the ﬁrms with

The Network of Inter-Regional Direct Investment Stocks Across Europe

7

number of employees larger or equal to 100. Also, a small percentage of around 1% of

ﬁrms was lost in this selection because the number of employees was not available. The

original data set consists of 181.945 ﬁrms from 39 European countries uniquely identiﬁed

by their Bureau Van Dijk identiﬁcation number (BVDID). For a given ﬁrm, shareholders

can be individuals/families, governments or other institutions that are not listed as ﬁrms.

Even when they are ﬁrms they may have only indirect ownership through intermediate

ﬁrms. Moreover, they may have less than 100 employees and therefore location and proﬁle

for them is not available in our data set. The set of ﬁrms which are involved in ownership

links with other ﬁrms includes 47.621 ﬁrms. We have chosen to restrict our analysis to

the direct ownership network of ﬁrms with more than 100 employees, implying that we

have the ﬁnancial proﬁle and geographical location of all the ﬁrms involved in this set of

ownership links. This is the set of data we use for the network analysis and it includes

29.314 ﬁrms and 22.174 links.

The selection of a subset of the ownership links induces of course an underestimation of

the total hosted investment stock. Still, investigating how investment size among this set

of ﬁrms is distributed in the network and among geographical regions is a very interesting

point to address.

A. Deﬁning the Quantities of Interest

For each ﬁrm i we consider the following quantities: the activity ai measured as number

of employees in the ﬁrm, the shares wij of ﬁrm i owned by any other ﬁrm j, and the

headquarter region Ri of ﬁrm i. The number of employees is one of the standard quantities

used to measure ﬁrm size [1], and in the following we will measure also investment stocks in

terms of number of employees. There are of course other possible measures of investment

stocks, based on capital rather than on human resources, but from the point of view of

labour market and economic impact at a local scale, it is relevant to have an estimate of

how many employees of a ﬁrm or a region depend on the investment coming from outside.

Shares are usually deﬁned as a percentage, but it is more convenient to deﬁne wij

as a fraction of ownership and, therefore, as a real number in [0, 1]. Not all shares are

necessarily held by entities external to the ﬁrm. Moreover some entities are not ﬁrms and

The Network of Inter-Regional Direct Investment Stocks Across Europe

network GF .

we only look at shares held by ﬁrms, as discussed above. Therefore it holds:

If we take the number of employees as a measure of activity of a ﬁrm, it is natural to

compute the quantity sij:

wij ≤

1

j6=i
X

sij = wijai

(1)

(2)

that represents the investment stock of ﬁrm i held by ﬁrm j.

We can deﬁne the ﬁrm network as a graph GF = (VF , EF ) Figure 1(left) where VF

is a set of nodes representing ﬁrms and EF is a set of directed edges between nodes.

An edge (i, j) represents the fact that ﬁrm j owns shares of ﬁrm i. The order of the

pair in this notation is natural for the layout of most databases of ﬁrms and we adopt

it. However, keep in mind, that ownership and investment have opposite directions. In

fact, it is more natural to deﬁne in-degree and out-degree of connectivity with respect to

investments rather than to ownership. We deﬁne as in-degree kin of a ﬁrm the number of

ﬁrms investing in i (holding shares of i). Similarly we deﬁne as out-degree kout of a ﬁrm

the number of outside ﬁrms in which ﬁrm i invests. The connectivity degree or simply

degree k of a node is the number of edges entering or departing from that node.

The Network of Inter-Regional Direct Investment Stocks Across Europe

9

We can associate to each edge (i, j) the normalized weight wij, representing the amount

of shares that ﬁrms j owns in i. But we can also associate the absolute weight sij. We

then deﬁne the inward investment stock ain

i of ﬁrm i , as the total stock invested in ﬁrm

i by other ﬁrms and outward investment stock aout

, as the total stock invested by ﬁrm i

i

in other ﬁrms:

ain
i =

sij

aout
i =

j

k

We can now deﬁne analogous quantities aggregated by region. The activity of region

m is deﬁned as the sum of the activity of the ﬁrms with headquarter in that region.

Am =

ai

i∈m
X
In other words, Am is the total number of workers employed by ﬁrms of that region.

Keep in mind that we analyse only a subset of all ﬁrms and that therefore, the activity

of a region can be much smaller than the number of individuals employed in that region.

The sum of the investments made by ﬁrms of region n in ﬁrms in region m is deﬁned as:

Smn =

sij

i∈m,j∈n
X

It can be seen both as the outward investment stock of region n in region m or as the

hosted investment stock in region m coming from region n

It is very natural at this point to deﬁne the region network as a graph GR = (VR, ER)

where nodes represent regions and a directed edge (m, n) from region m to region n

represents the fact that some ﬁrms of region n own shares in some ﬁrms of region m. The

diagram in ﬁgure 1 illustrates the procedure of building the network of regions. Small

circles represent ﬁrms with their associated values of activity. Edges represent ownership

relations. Larger circles represent regions in which ﬁrms have their headquarters. The

edges in ﬁrm network among all ﬁrms in regions m and n sum up to form an edge between

m and n in the region network. We associate to the edge (m, n) the absolute weight Smn.

The degree is deﬁned as for the ﬁrm region and in particular in-degree and out-degree are

deﬁned with respect to investments.

The sum of the investments made in ﬁrms of a region by ﬁrms of any other region will

be called inward investment stock of region m (eq.6). In the following we will refer to this

(3)

(4)

(5)

quantity also as hosted investment stock. Similarly, the sum of the investments made by

the ﬁrms of a region in ﬁrms of other regions will be called outward investment stock of

region m (eq.6).

(6)

Both deﬁnitions are chosen in analogy with the terms used in the literature about Foreign

Direct Investments. But instead of looking at investments between diﬀerent countries, we

increase the spatial resolution to the level of regions.

As only the few most important shareholders of each ﬁrm are usually listed in the

database, the in-degree of ﬁrms is a bias quantity with little meaning for our purposes.

However, when aggregating by region, the in-degree of a region represents the number

of other regions in which the top shareholders of ﬁrms in the focal region have their

headquarters. This quantity is not limited a priori and as such it makes sense to study

its distribution.

B. Measuring the Quantities of Interest

Our perspective in this work is to try and relate the microscopic and macroscopic

aspects of the network of investments between ﬁrms and between regions. We want to

look at statistical distributions and not at single or average values, the aim being to try

and understand what is the individual tendency that builds up the macroscopic properties.

Therefore we will focus on the probability distributions of the quantities deﬁned above.

In order to study the probability distribution (pdf) of a variable x it is useful to plot

its cumulative distribution function (cdf) deﬁned as

PC(ˆx) =

p(x)dx

Zx≥ˆx

(7)

where x

p(x) is the probability distribution function.

In words, the cdf gives the

→

fraction of a randomly chosen sample of the variable x that lies above the value ˆx. A

simple way of constructing P (x) is the following. Consider the vector x of N real numbers.

We rank x in ascending order. Clearly, now all values are larger or equal to the ﬁrst data

point. So the probability distribution starts from 1 and decreases. The k-th component

of the vector x has ascending rank k and there are N

k values larger or equal to x(k).

The Network of Inter-Regional Direct Investment Stocks Across Europe

The fraction of data larger or equal to x(k) is N

k/N. We therefore simply plot the

−
k/N) for all k. If some values of x are repeated and in particular if x is a

pair (x(k), N

discrete variable, then the plot will display ’stairs’. In this case it is preferable to count

the fraction P of data that are larger or equal to each value x and then to plot P versus

However, its cumulative distribution does not have an analytical expression.

It is usually more accurate and safe to estimate the exponent from the cdf rather than

from the pdf, because of the ﬂuctuations in the frequency of high values of x. This is

usually done by ﬁtting the cdf in log

log scale with a line and computing the slope.

However, it has been recently remarked that this method introduces a systematic bias

[12]. An alternative method that doesn’t make use of a graphic ﬁt is described in [18].

The formula for the exponent is

where xmin is the lower limit of the range of data following the power law. Conﬁdence

intervals for γ can be computed with the standard bootstrap technique.

When a relation holds between two variables, then their respective probability distri-

butions are also related through the equation:

An important consequence is that if, x is power law distributed and y scales as a power

law of x, then y is also power law distributed, and a relation holds for all the exponents

involved (power law distributions are closed with respect to the operation of power law

rescaling).

If x is log normal distributed, and y scales as a power law of x, then the

distribution of y converges to a log normal function for large y. This observation implies

that, if two variables are both power law distributed, and we suspect that a relation might

hold between them, such relation could be a power law scaling, therefore we have to be

careful while checking for possible correlations.

In fact, in the study of the correlation between quantities, related to ﬁrms and regions,

that span several order of magnitude and have to be studied in log

log scale, we proceed

−

as follows. Consider the variables (X, Y ) for instance. We compute the log 10 of both
variables and produce a scatter plot of ( ˜X, ˜Y ) = (log 10X, log 10Y ). We then divide the

X axes in k bins of equal size. For each bin centered in the value xi, we compute the

mean yi and the standard deviation σyi of the values of Y for which the corresponding

abcissa falls in the bin k. We obtain a new set of data points (x, y) that allows to better

display the trend of the original data (X, Y ). A linear ﬁt is then performed on the (x, y)

data points, and values of slope, intercept and correlation coeﬃcient are computed. We

remind that a linear relationship between x and y implies taking the exponential, a power

law relationship between the original variables:

log 10(Y ) = m

˜Y = m

˜X + q

·
log 10(X) + q

·

Y = C

X m

·

(14)

(15)

(16)

where C = 10q. Of course, while the operation of binning and averaging over bins is

a standard procedure one should be careful in this case, as such operation does not

commute with the operation of taking the exponential. However, we are not aware of

any documented bias introduced by this procedure and if the ﬁt is reasonably good we

conclude that Y is scaling as a power law of X and we take m as the exponent of the

scaling law.

III. ANALYSIS AT THE LEVEL OF FIRMS

We ﬁrst report the cumulative frequency distribution of activity and investment stock

of ﬁrms. We also investigate how investment stock scale with ﬁrm activity and with ﬁrm

connectivity degree. We then report the analogous results for regions where activity, in-

vestment stock and connectivity degree of regions are deﬁned as in section II A. Similarly,

we investigate how investment stock scale with region activity and region connectivity

degree.

A. Firms. Distributions of activity,investment and connectivity degree

In ﬁgure 2 we report the cumulative distribution (cdf) of activity and investment stock

of ﬁrms computed from our data set. The onset at the value 100 for the activity is

simply due to the restriction of the data set to ﬁrms with more than 100 employees.

Investment stock can of course take smaller values as it is measured as a fraction of the

number of employees per ﬁrm. The cumulative distributions display a linear decay over 3

decades or more. However some ’bumps’ deviating from linearity are visible. The curves

can either be ﬁtted with log normal distributions with very large standard deviation

or can be reasonably ﬁtted with a power law. In both cases the meaning is the same:

the probability of ﬁnding large ﬁrms is decreasing approximately as the exponent of the

power law ﬁtting the curve. Computing the exponent from the linear ﬁt is known to

introduce bias [12], hence following a known procedure [18] the values of the exponents

and conﬁdence intervals were computed as described in II. The values of the exponents

and their conﬁdence interval are reported in table I.

Our ﬁnding concerning the activity is in line with what is generally known in the

literature for ﬁrm size distributions of many countries and historical epochs. It implies

that ﬁrm activity is very heterogeneous and that roughly speaking, very large values and

very small values of activity are much more frequent that in normal distributions. We

remind the reader that the data set analysed includes only ﬁrms involved in an ownership

relationship in Europe and not all ﬁrms indiscriminately. However, the value of exponent

γ is not far from results obatined in previous studies. For instance Axtell reports 2.056

for the US ﬁrm activity distribution [1]. Fujiwara et al. report 1.995 for UK based on

The Network of Inter-Regional Direct Investment Stocks Across Europe

TABLE I: Firms. Power law ﬁt values for Cumulative Distributions.

data from Amadeus Database [6]. On the other hand, the fact that investment stock

distribution is also a power law is to our knowledge a novel result.

In particular, the

values of the exponent γ for activity and outward investment stock are very close.

This ﬁnding might suggest that a scaling relation holds between the two variables (as

discussed in section II B). However, this hypothesis had not been empirically veriﬁed so

far in the literature and we don’t know a priori to what extent it holds. We will then

investigate its validity in the next section.

As is usual in the study of networks, we report the cumulative distribution functions

(cdf) of the degree of connectivity of ﬁrms (ﬁgure 3 ). We distinguish between (total)

degree, in-degree and out-degree as deﬁned in II A. The distributions span a short range

of less than two decades. The out-degree display a linear decay in log

be ﬁtted by a power law with exponent 3.85, which is a little larger than the typical values

observed in many empirical complex networks (typically in the range [1.8 3]). The result

implies that the number of connections between ﬁrms is moderately heterogeneous and

decreases slower than exponentially. The curve for the in-degree instead is not meaningful

as mentioned in section II B and simply shows how many records of shareholders are

available per ﬁrm. The linear ﬁt was performed just for sake of completeness.

However, it is important to remark that the connectivity out-degree represents the

number of ownership relations in which the ﬁrm is involved, regardless of the size of

shares involved in each relation. Because the degree doesn’t take into account the size

of the shares, a large out-degree doesn’t mean that a ﬁrms really controls a lot of other

ﬁrms. Alternative quantities are needed to characterize the ownership concentration such

as those introduced in [4] and they will be applied to the present data set in a future

study.

In order to understand why investment of ﬁrms are power law distributed and why

distributions of outward investment and activity have exponents very close to each other

we investigate the correlations between activity, investment and connectivity out-degree.

The plots in ﬁgures 4 - 5 are produced by taking the log 10 of the quantities and binning

the data on the x axes as described in section II B.

We notice that the exponent 0.925 for the scaling of hosted investment versus activity

is smaller than, but still close to 1. This means that ﬁrms tend to host investment in

amount almost just proportional to their activity. This is not surprising if we consider

that all ﬁrms in the data set analysed, are owned to some extent by some other ﬁrm in

the data set and in many cases the share is large and close to 1. A deeper understanding

would require an investigation of the statistics of the ownership concentration and will

be carried out in a future work. On the other hand the exponent 0.61 for the scaling

of outward investment versus activity implies that although more active ﬁrms tend to

invest more, the investment increases less than linearly as a function of the activity (sub-

linear increase). This means that very large and active ﬁrms invest less, in proportion,

with respect to smaller ones. Such a ﬁnding becomes quite important if an institution in

charge of attracting investments from ﬁrms is trying to estimate the expected investment

of ﬁrms based on their activity.

Finally, the exponent 1.57 for the scaling of activity versus out-degree is quite inter-

esting. It implies that the larger the ﬁrm the larger the number of investments but the

increase is sub-linear. Interestingly, the value of the exponent is not far from the values

found for the scaling law between invested volume and degree in some stock markets: 1.1

for Nasdaq, 1.43 for NYSE, 1.59 for MIB [8]. In that case the invested volume is exactly

the analogous quantity to the outward investment. Moreover, the scaling law resembles

the one observed inthe context of air traﬃc networks for a quantity analogous to the

The Network of Inter-Regional Direct Investment Stocks Across Europe

18

outward investment which has been recently introduced as node strength [2]. In that case

the exponent found is 1.7. These ﬁndings might support the idea that a universal scaling

law for node strength holds in complex networks where the weight plays a crucial role.

In a future work we will investigate possible network formation models leading to the

emergence of such scaling law in economic networks.

IV. ANALYSIS AT THE LEVEL OF REGIONS

A. Regions. Distributions of activity, investment and connectivity degree

In ﬁgure 6 (left) we report the cumulative distribution of activity A and in-
ward/outward/total investment stock Ain, Aout, Ain+out for regions. These quantities

were computed from the data set as described in section II A. As done for the case of

ﬁrms, in order to check to what extent they overlap we also normalized such quantities

and we report their cumulative distribution in ﬁgure 6 (right) . As it can be seen, the

overlap is only partial. This may suggest that a non linear scaling holds between the

variables and this hypothesis will be investigated in the next section.

It must be remarked that the way regions are deﬁned within a country surely depends

on the country’s administrative system. To give an example, the regions provided in the

data set are at the level of ’provincia’ for Italy and ’department’ for France which have

comparable surface on average.

Diﬀerently from the case of the ﬁrms, the distributions do not display a linear decay

in log

log scale but rather a quadratic one which we tried to ﬁt with log-normal distri-

−

butions. The ﬁt with log normal is quite good although a discrepancy can be observed in

the right tail. On the other hand, only the very last portion of the distribution could be

ﬁtted with a power law. Values for the coeﬃcients of the log normal ﬁt are given in table

At a ﬁrst sight the ﬁnding that the distributions above are log normal is puzzling,

as one may expect that region activity and investment stocks also scale with a power

law. However, the following remark is relevant at this point. Cities ranges from small

villages of few inhabitants to metropolis of 10-20 millions. Firms also range from one-

person enterprises to multinationals with few hundreds thousands employees. On the

other hand, while the position of the boundaries of a region surely is the result of the

historical process, the surface and the amount of population within a region is probably

limited by administration tasks constraints, in the sense that if the administrative load

becomes too heavy, the region is split into two. For instance within a same country there

are no regions which are orders of magnitude larger in surface than other regions. On the

other hand, it is known that activity of countries measured by Gross Domestic Product

is power law distributed with exponent 1 [7]. So it appears that regions are clearly less

heterogeneous with respect to ﬁrms and countries. However before trying to draw some

implications for economic development policies, it would be interesting to normalize the

activity of the regions by the regions surface and/or active population. Unfortunately

these data were not available during this work.

In ﬁgure 7 we report the cdf of the connectivity degree for regions. All curves are

clearly not power laws and we tried to ﬁt them with log-normal functions. Values of

coeﬃcients are reported in table IV. The curve for the in-degree is systematically above

the one for the out-degree. Given the fact that the pdf is the derivative of the cdf, the

plot implies that in the range [1 50] the in-degree is typically smaller than the out-degree

while above 50 the opposite holds. We don’t have an explanation for this ﬁnding. On

the other hand we remind that as in the case of ﬁrms, the number of connections is not

necessarily meaningful. In fact this is exactly why we have introduced the inward and

B. Regions. Activity, investment and connectivity degree: correlations

In order to understand why investment of regions are log normal distributed and why

distributions of inward/outward investment and activity display a partial overlap after

normalization (see section II B), we investigate the correlations between activity, invest-

ment and connectivity in/out-degree of regions. With the same procedure used for the

case of ﬁrms (see section III B), we produced the plots in ﬁgures 8-9 (see section II B.

Tables VI,VII report the values of slope and correlation coeﬃcients for the linear ﬁt

of the binned data. Again the correlation coeﬃcients are all quite close to 1 so, with

the caveat mentioned in section II B, we conclude that the data indicate the existence

of scaling laws in the network of regions between investment and activity and between

connectivity degree and activity.

We notice that the exponents 0.62 and 0.82 for the scaling of hosted investment versus

activity and outward investment versus activity respectively are smaller than 1.

As seen at the ﬁrm level, it follows that although more active regions tend to make

and host more investment, the investment increases less than linearly as a function of the

less than smaller regions. However, the increase of outward investment with activity

is stronger for regions (m = 0.82) than for ﬁrms (m = 0.61 see table II). This is an

interesting result that we will address in the future.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we propose a simple but novel procedure to build the network of inter-

regional investment, based on the number of employees of ﬁrms in each region and their

network of ownership.

In this network representation, the connectivity in-degree of a

region is the number of other regions from which ﬁrms invest in the focal region, while

the out-degree is the number of regions in which ﬁrms of the focal region invest. The

sum of the weights over the incoming links represents the hosted investment stock of a

region in terms of employees. The sum over the outgoing links represents the outward

investment stock of a region in terms of employees.

We study the statistical properties of investment stock networks at the level of ﬁrms

and at the level of regions. Our ﬁrst result is that investment stock of ﬁrms is power

law distributed and that, in particular, the exponent of outward investment is very close

to the one of ﬁrm activity. As it is well known, this fact may result from a power law

scaling relation between activity and outward investment. This is neither obvious nor

documented in the literature, so it has to be checked empirically. At a ﬁrst sight, activity

and investment are quite scattered and span a few orders of magnitude. However, by

taking the logarithm of the values of activity and investments, and binning the data, we

indeed ﬁnd that investment scales as a power of the activity. Moreover, power law scaling

relations also hold between investment stock and connectivity degree.

On the other hand, in the case of regions, we ﬁnd log normal distributions for activity,

investments and degree. Now, it can be argued that this result might simply be related

to the distribution of population size across regions (unfortunately we do not have data

to test this hypothesis at the moment). Even so, it is a remarkable fact that such proba-

The Network of Inter-Regional Direct Investment Stocks Across Europe

25

bility distributions for the regions clearly diﬀer both from those of ﬁrms as from those of

countries in the world. The impact of this fact on the design of global policies to foster

investments and economic development should be investigated.

Again, the fact that similar distributions emerge for activity, investment and connectiv-

ity degree of regions suggests that some relation should hold among them. In particular,

we ﬁnd that investment of ﬁrms scales as a power of the degree with exponent 1.57 (out-

degree), while for regions it scales with exponents 1.37 and 1.47 (in-degree and out degree

respectively). Interestingly, previous studies on diﬀerent data set have investigated the

scaling law of two quantities (invested volume and node strength) strictly analogous to

the investment stock and found exponent values between 1.1 and 1.7 [2, 8]. The existence

of scaling laws relating investment, activity and connectivity both in ﬁrms and regions

is an interesting and novel result relevant to the ﬁelds of complex networks, industrial

economics and geography.

On the other hand, such scaling laws should be of interest for policy making. For

instance we ﬁnd that very active regions invest less, in proportion, with respect to smaller

ones. The same holds for ﬁrms, although the coeﬃcient governing the relation between

investment and activity are diﬀerent. This kind of result allows to make some statistical

predictions about the investments that regions will receive or make, based on their activity

and connectivity. The present work is a ﬁrst step towards understanding the relation

between the local dynamics of investment ﬂows and the macro-economical facts emerging

at a global level. One can ask for example whether such a distribution of investments is

desirable with respect to some societal goals that might be at stake at the country or at

the EU level. If it is not, one can investigate if introducing some incentive policies, the

distribution can be improved with respect to the goals. In this sense, the ﬁndings reported

here should stimulate the investigation of models for managing the development of regions

and the optimal allocation of resources. Overall, we believe that these results open the

way for further studies with potential long run implications in policy making at the level

of EU investment promotion, support to underdeveloped EU regions and optimization of

investment ﬂow.

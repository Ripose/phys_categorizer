Abstract

Religiosity is one of the most important sociological aspects of popu-
lations. All religions may evolve in their beliefs and adapt to the society
developments. A religion is a social variable, like a language or wealth, to
be studied like any other organizational parameter.

Several questions can be raised, as considered in this study: e.g. (i)
from a “macroscopic” point of view : How many religions exist at a given
time? (ii) from a “microscopic” view point: How many adherents be-
long to one religion? Does the number of adherents increase or not, and
how? No need to say that if quantitative answers and mathematical laws
are found, agent based models can be imagined to describe such non-
equilibrium processes.

It is found that empirical laws can be deduced and related to pref-
erential attachment processes, like on evolving network; we propose two
diﬀerent algorithmic models reproducing as well the data. Moreover, a
population growth-death equation is shown to be a plausible modeling
of evolution dynamics in a continuous time framework. Diﬀerences with
language dynamic competition is emphasized.

1 Introduction

All features of societies (beliefs, attitudes, behaviors, languages, wealth, etc.)
are due to competition [1]. Recently the dynamics of world’s languages, espe-
cially on their disappearing due to competition with other languages [2] has been
of interest. It is fair to examine whether such considerations can be applied to
religions.

We do not enter into any discussion on the deﬁnition of a religion; we rec-
ognize that there are various denominations which can impair data gathering
and subsequent analysis; like many, we admit to put on the same footing reli-
gions, philosophies, sects and rituals. Idem for adherents or adepts; there are
In fact, a similar set of consid-
also agnostics, atheists or “not concerned”.
erations exists when discussing languages and dialects, slangs, etc. Indeed it
is expected that there are many similarities, although many are diﬀerences1,

between the diﬀusion, relaxation and distribution of languages and religions.
What is their geographical distribution? What is their life time? How do they
evolve, - from monotheism to polytheism and “backwards”? How long does an
adept/adherent remain in one religion? Moreover, even though many societies
are thought to form a hierarchy, due to a competition between individual con-
cerns, as explained by Bonabeau et al. [3] or discussed by Sousa and Stauﬀer [4],
such considerations for religion should be left for further investigation. These
questions need much more reliable data than it seems available and practical
at this time. Thus, let us claim that we are not interested here in religion’s
origin, activity, history or hierarchy, but rather in statistical physics aspects of
a non-equilibrium agent based system. We will then consider as parameters the
numbers of adherents of each religion, and only these numbers will be treated
as physics object (and not the religions themselves).

To address these issues, we have followed classical scientiﬁc steps as in physics
investigations. We have analyzed “empirical” data on the number of adherents
of religions taken from two diﬀerent freely available data sets.

The next scientiﬁc step is to analyze the data along statistical physics modern
lines. Zipf and Pareto-like plots will be given. After deducing empirical laws, a
theoretical modeling is in order. In view of the observed features, and following
standard intuition, one thinks at once about two algorithmic “agent based”
models, describing preferential attachment on a network, as in the Potts model
[5] of magnetism or Axelrod model [1] in sociology, already applied in opinion
formation studies [6].

Thereafter studying the time evolution of several “main” religions, we ob-
serve that a microscopic interpretation is plausible along the lines of a growth
Avrami equation in a continuous time framework. This equation seems more
plausible than the generalized Verhulst equation for modeling the dynamics
of language deaths [2] because the former allows better handling of “internal
and/or external ﬁelds” (as those mentioned above, - most of them missing in
language dynamics) as well as (microscopic) homogeneous and/or heterogeneous
ﬂuctuations at an early stage of evolution, - while the Verhulst equation of
Abrams and Strogatz [2] is grossly empirical. Notice that languages were simu-
lated also with other than Lotka-Verhulst-Volterra mechanisms [2]; see e.g. ref.
[7].

2 Data

The ﬁrst data set is taken from The International Data Base (IDB)[8]. Data on
Religions are included in table 58 and contains information on the population
of 103 nations worldwide. The surveys were carried between 1960 and 1992. In
the dataset are recorded the number of adherents of 150 religions, taking into
account about 2 billion people (1/3 of the present world population).

The second data set was taken from the World Christian Encyclopedia
(WCE) [9], it gives information on the number of adherents of the world’s
main religions and their main denominations (56 religions overall) consider-

2

ing the whole world population. From this data set we have also information
on changes during one century of the number of adherents of each religion from
1900 till 2000, measured over a 5 year span, with a forecast for 2025 and 2050.
No need to say that further work should go back to history: the number of “re-
ligions” is highly time dependent, the more so when one distinguishes them to
the level of denominations and sects; the number of adherents of a given religion
is not ﬁxed either. History is full of examples of individuals or entire groups
of people changing their religion, - for various reasons: following the “leader”
(e.g. Constantinus, ...) or “external pressure” (e.g. inquisition, ...) or “internal
pressure” or so called adaptation under proselytism action...

One should also be aware that such surveys are biased, and are hardly snap-
shots of a situation like in a laboratory experiment. Yet, beside these caveats,
the main diﬀerence between the two data sets is in the information they give on
religions with a small number of adherents. While this information is present
(even if not for all considered nations, and only partially) in the ﬁrst data set,
the second data set does not consider small religious groups.
It is also un-
clear how much distinction was made in the IDB and WCE surveys concerning
denominations and sects so called adstrated to the main religions.

3 Zipf’s and Pareto’s distributions

The Zipf’s and Pareto’s distributions are shown in ﬁgure 1 for both data sets.
Recall that the Zipf distribution results from a hierarchical ranking (of the
considered religions according to their number of adherents). The Pareto dis-
tribution shows instead the number of religions with a number of adherents n
greater than N as a function of N . In ﬁgure 1(a) and 1(b), the Zipf and Pareto
distributions are shown respectively for the ﬁrst dataset while 1(c) and 1(d)
show results for the second data set in diﬀerent (so-called) years.
It can be
noticed that the Zipf distribution for both data sets can be ﬁtted by a straight
line, with diﬀerent slopes, - except for the tails, i.e. where religions with a very
small or high number of adherents are to be found (see caveats above). How-
ever it is remarkable that a diﬀerent behavior between both data sets is found
in the case of the Pareto distribution: while for the IDB data set, Fig.1(b), it
can be seen that the Pareto distribution roughly follows a power law at least
for N > 105, i.e. f (N ) ∝ N −0.4; this is not the case for the WCE data set,
Fig. 1(d), where the linearity is present only in a log-linear plot. Notice that
the former law exponent of the Pareto distribution is similar to that found in
language studies [7]. Such an empirical non trivial power law is consistent with
a preferential attachment process [10] on a network, i.e.
it is more likely that
one has the religion of one’s mother or neighbor....

4 Partial distribution functions

In order to compare the two data sets, and their meaning or bias, and observe
the time evolution of adherence (or attachment) we have divided the popula-
tion interval [1, 109] into 18 bins of exponentially increasing size and ﬁlled each
bin with the number of religions having that number of adherents (normalized
to have the distribution area equal to 1). The result is a partial distribution
function (pdf), Fig.2, that can be ﬁtted (i) with a Weibull distribution (symbol
+), much used in life time (or failure) studies,

f (x) =

− (x−µ)

β e

e

1
β

− (x−µ)
β

−e

(1)

where x = log10(n) and n is the number of adherents or/and (ii) with a lognor-
mal distribution (symbol x); both ﬁts are quite similar, with a slight diﬀerence
in the upper tail. For comparison the best corresponding Gaussian distribution
(continuous line) is shown in the same plot. This leads to consider that two
empirical functions can be possible based on diﬀerent concepts at this level of
data acquisition : (i) birth-death processes2, (ii) multiplicative production with
many independent factors.

The same procedure can be applied to the WCE data set, whence obtaining
the pdf’s shown in Fig. 3 for diﬀerent (so called) years. To eliminate the
eﬀect due to increasing world population in the “years” considered, all pdf’s of
diﬀerent “years” were normalized to the same population number considering
1900 as the reference population. A ﬁt of these distributions, with Eq.(1), is
shown in Fig.3. In order to plot all the pdf’s on the same graph each pdf has
been successively displaced by 0.6. The apparent ﬂatness of the pdf is due
to the vertical rescaling. From this ﬁgure a critical view of this data has to
be implied: notice the break at 107, indicating in our view an overestimation
of adepts/adherents in the most prominent religions, or a lack of distinctions
between denominations, as can be easily understood [11]. This “emphasis” of
the “winner takes all” in the WCE data, i.e. the empirical data results from
summing up adherents from the most important sort of religion and smaller
related denominations into a single number corresponding to (the main) religion,
hints to explaining the diﬀerence between Pareto plots in Figs. 1(b), - 1(d),

5 Time evolution

Finally, it is easily accepted that the percentages of adherents are not ﬁxed over
time. Therefore a nucleation-growth-death process can be proposed, in analogy
with crystal growth studies [12]. We consider that a microscopic-like, continuous

2We realize that x is Eq.(1) is the size of the population, while the variable of the Weibull
distribution is rather the strength of to-be-broken bonds in a “time to failure” analysis. If
there is a one-to-one correspondence between the x and y axes in cause-eﬀect relations, such
a change in meaning is only a change in notations. Otherwise, hysteresis eﬀects are to be
considered. This goes beyond our present study.

time diﬀerential equation can be written for the evolution of the number of
adherents (in terms of percentage with respect to the world population) of the
world main religions, as for competing entities of the type [13]

d
dt

g(t) = Sk(t)[1 − g(t)]

dVn
dt

(2)

where, adapting to our case this Avrami-Kolmogorov equation, g(t) is counting
the fraction of adherents of a given religion, Vn is instead connected with the
total world population, S is a parameter to be determined and k(t) ∝ t−h where
h is a parameter to be deduced in each case, measuring the attachment-growth
(or death) process in this continuous time approximation. This should be con-
trasted with the Lotka-Volterra-Verhulst mechanistic approach (for languages)
which hardly allows for nucleation, dissipation and/or time delayed correlations
of diﬀerent entities, in contrast to generalizations of Eq. (2) using such physical
features.

A few examples of religions for which the number of adherents is increasing
(e.g., Islam), decaying (e.g., Ethnoreligions and Buddhists) or rather stable (e.g.,
Christianity) is shown in Fig.4. The data can be well ﬁtted to the solution of
the Avrami-Kolmogorov growth-death equation Eq.(2). The values of h for the
considered religions, as obtained by a least-square best ﬁt, are reported in the
plot. The parameter h values and their meaning deserve some short explanation
and discussion. The parameter can be thought to be like a reproduction rate in
Verhulst logistic equation, or a true attachment like in sexual networks [14] or
in molecular processes [15]. It is interesting to observe that h can be positive or
negative, indicating also the possibility for detachment. Other parametrizations
of k(t) can be imagined and are possible. Our theoretical law elsewhere derived
from ﬁrst principles [13] concludes the present scientiﬁc analysis in showing that
a predictability level can be reached on the evolutions.

6 Conclusions

In conclusion, as for languages or wealth, one can recognize religions as a sig-
nature of population dynamics. Even though characteristic time scales are dif-
ferent, and religion dynamics is more complex than language dynamics because
of the presence of external ﬁelds and spontaneous nucleations, empirical rank-
ing laws look similar. Therefore similar growth-death agent based models can
be thought of. Yet, there are useful diﬀerences to be expected (and found)
which lead to diﬀerent models from those describing language death and ap-
pearance. We propose an algorithmic approach based on attachment processes
for the macroscopic point of view, - not deciding on the statistical alternative,
i.e. Weibull or log-normal law, and a diﬀusion growth rate based equation for
modeling the data at the microscopic level. There are possible open problems
on the ongoing research, or further investigations taking into account the avail-
able/reliable data at this time, as to look for (time dependent) geographical ef-
fects, like clustering, or through other deﬁnitions, like normalizing with respect

5

to some population size or country surface, or GDP, or other socio-economic
index allowing to build correlation matrices and search for socio-economic ﬁeld
inﬂuence.

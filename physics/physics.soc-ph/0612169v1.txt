Clustering in Complex Directed Networks

Many empirical networks display an inherent tendency to cluster, i.e. to form circles of connected
nodes. This feature is typically measured by the clustering coeﬃcient (CC). The CC, originally
introduced for binary, undirected graphs, has been recently generalized to weighted, undirected
networks. Here we extend the CC to the case of (binary and weighted) directed networks and
we compute its expected value for random graphs. We distinguish between CCs that count all
directed triangles in the graph (independently of the direction of their edges) and CCs that only
consider particular types of directed triangles (e.g., cycles). The main concepts are illustrated by
employing empirical data on world-trade ﬂows.

Keywords: Clustering, Clustering Coeﬃcient, Complex Networks, Directed Graphs, Weighted Networks.

Networked structures emerge almost ubiquitously in
complex systems. Examples include the Internet and
the WWW, airline connections, scientiﬁc collaborations
and citations, trade and labor-market contacts, friend-
ship and other social relationships, business relations
and R&S partnerships, cellular, ecological and neural
networks (Albert and Barab´asi, 2002; Newman, 2003;
Dorogovtsev and Mendes, 2003).

The majority of such “real-world” networks have been
shown to display structural properties that are neither
those of a random graph (Bollob´as, 1985), nor those of
regular lattices. For example, many empirically-observed
networks are small-worlds (Kochen, 1989; Watts, 1999).
These networks are simultaneously characterized by two
features (Amaral et al., 2000). First, as happens for ran-
dom graphs, their diameter1 increases only logarithmi-
cally with the number of nodes. This means that, even
if the network is very large, any two seemingly unrelated
nodes can reach each other in a few steps. Second, as
happens in lattices, small-world networks are highly clus-
tered, i.e. any two neighbors of a given node have a
probability of being themselves neighbors which is much
larger than in random graphs.

Network clustering is a well-known concept in sociol-
ogy, where notions such as “cliques” and “transitive tri-
ads” have been widely employed (Wasserman and Faust,
1994; Scott, 2000). For example, friendship networks are
typically highly clustered (i.e. they display high cliquish-
ness) because any two friends of a person are very likely
to be friends.

The tendency of a network to form tightly connected
neighborhoods (more than in the random uncorrelated
case) can be measured by the clustering coeﬃcient (CC),

see Watts and Strogatz (1998) and Szab´o et al. (2004).
The idea is very simple. Consider a binary, undirected
network (BUN) described by the graph G = (N, A),
where N is the number of the nodes and A = {aij} is the
N ×N adjacency matrix, whose generic element aij = 1 if
and only if there is an edge connecting nodes i and j (i.e.
if they are neighbors) and zero otherwise. Since the net-
work is undirected, A is symmetric2. For any given node
i, let di be its degree, i.e. the number of i’s neighbors.
The extent to which i’s neighborhood is clustered can be
measured by the percentage of pairs of i’s neighbors that
are themselves neighbors, i.e. by the ratio between the
number of triangles in g with i as one vertex (labeled as
ti) and the number of all possible triangles that i could
have formed (that is, Ti = di(di − 1)/2)3. It is easy to
see that the CC for node i in this case reads:

Ci(A) =

1
2

j6=i

h6=(i,j) aijaihajh

P

P
1
2 di(di − 1)

=

(A3)ii
di(di − 1)

,

(1)

where (A3)ii is the i-th element of the main diagonal
of A3 = A · A · A. Each product aijaihajh is meant to
count whether a triangle exists or not around i. Notice
that the order of subscripts is irrelevant, as all entries
in A are symmetric. Of course, Ci ∈ [0, 1]. The overall
(network-wide) CC for the graph G is then obtained by
N
averaging Ci over the N nodes, i.e. C = N −1
i=1 Ci.
In the case of a random graph where each link is in place
with probability p ∈ (0, 1), one has that C = p.

Binary networks treat all edges present in G as they
were completely homogeneous. More recently, scholars

nodes (van Leeuwen, 1999).

well-deﬁned. If not, we will simply set the CC to zero.

have become increasingly aware of the fact that real net-
works exhibit a relevant heterogeneity in the capacity
and intensity of their connections (Barrat et al., 2004,
2005; Barth´elemy et al., 2005; DeMontis et al., 2005;
Kossinets and Watts, 2006). Allowing for this hetero-
geneity might be crucial to better understand the archi-
tecture of complex networks. In order to incorporate such
previously neglected feature, each edge ij present in G
(i.e. such that aij = 1) is assigned a value wij > 0 pro-
portional to the weight of that link in the network. For
example, weights can account for the amount of trade
volumes exchanged between countries (as a fraction of
their gross domestic product), the number of passengers
travelling between airports, the traﬃc between two In-
ternet nodes, the number of e-mails exchanged between
pairs of individuals, etc.. Without loss of generality, we
can suppose that wij ∈ [0, 1] 4. A weighted undirected
network (WUN) is thus characterized by its N × N sym-
metric weight matrix W = {wij}, where wii = 0, all i.
Many network indices developed for BUNs have a direct
counterpart in WUNs. For example, the concept of node
degree can be replaced by that of node strength:

si =

wij .

Xj6=i

(2)

For more complicated indices, however, extensions to
WUNs are not straightforward. To generalize the CC of
node i to WUNs, one has indeed to take into account
the weight associated to edges in the neighborhood of
i. There are many ways to do that (see Saramaki et al.,
2006, for a review). For example, suppose that a triangle
ihj is in place. One might then consider only weights
of the edges ih and ij (Barrat et al., 2004). Alterna-
tively, one might employ the weights of all the edges
in the triangle.
In turn, the total contribution of a
triangle can be deﬁned as the geometric mean of its
weights (Onnela et al., 2005) or simply as the product
among them (Holme et al., 2004; Zhang and Hovarth,
2005; Grindrod, 2002; Ahnert et al., 2006). In what fol-
lows, we will focus on the extension of the CC to WUNs
originally introduced in Onnela et al. (2005):

from W by taking the k-th root of each entry. As dis-
cussed in Saramaki et al. (2006), the index ˜Ci ranges in
[0, 1] and reduces to Ci when weights become binary. Fur-
thermore, it takes into account weights of all edges in a
triangle (but does not consider weights not participating

one triangle. Notice that ˜Ci = 1 only if the neighborhood
of i actually contains all possible triangles that can be
formed and each edge participating in these triangles has
unit (maximum) weight. Again, one can deﬁne the over-

In this paper we discuss extensions of the CC for
1 and 3) to the case of di-
BUNs and WUNs (eqs.
rected networks.
It is well-known that many real-
world complex networks involve non-mutual relation-
ships, which imply non-symmetric adjacency or weight
matrices. For instance, trade volumes between countries
(Garlaschelli and Loﬀredo, 2004; Serrano and Bogu˜n´a,
2003; Garlaschelli and Loﬀredo, 2005) are implicitly di-
rectional relations, as the export from country i to coun-
try j is typically diﬀerent from the export from country
j to country i (i.e.
If such net-
works are symmetrized (e.g., by averaging imports and
exports of country i), one could possibly underestimate
important aspects of their network architecture.

imports of i from j).

In directed networks, edges are oriented and neighbor-
ing relations are not necessarily symmetric. In the case of
binary directed networks (BDNs), we deﬁne the in-degree
of node i as the number of edges pointing towards i (i.e.,
inward edges). The out-degree of node i is accordingly
deﬁned as the number of edges originating from i (i.e.,
outward edges). Formally:

din
i =

aji = (AT )i1

dout
i =

aij = (A)i1,

Xj6=i

Xj6=i

(4)

(5)

where AT is the transpose of A, (A)i stands for the i-
th row of A, and 1 is the N -dimensional column vector
(1, 1, . . . , 1)T . The total-degree of a node i simply the
sum of its in- and out-degree:

i = din
dtot

i + dout

i = (AT + A)i1.

(6)

Finally, the number of bilateral edges between i and its
neighbors (i.e. the number of nodes j for which both an
edge i → j and an edge j → i exist) is computed as:

d↔
i =

aijaji = A2
ii.

Xj6=i

(7)

It is easy to see that in BUNs one has: di = dtot

i − d↔
i .

The above measures can be easily extended to weighted
directed networks (WDNs), by considering in-, out- and
total-strength (see eq. 2).

Binary Directed Networks. We begin by introducing the
most general extension of the CC to BDNs, which con-
siders all possible directed triangles formed by each node,
no matter the directions of their edges. Consider node i.

3

When edges are directed, i can generate up to 8 diﬀerent
triangles with any pair of neighbors5. Any product of the
form aij aihajh captures one particular triangle, see Fig.
1 for an illustration.

FIG. 1 Binary directed graphs. All 8 diﬀerent triangles with
node i as one vertex. Within each triangle is reported the
product of the form a∗∗a∗∗a∗∗ that works as indicator of that
triangle in the network.

The CC for node i (CD

i ) in BDNs can be thus deﬁned
(like in BUNs) as the ratio between all directed triangles
actually formed by i (tD
i ) and the number of all possible
triangles that i could form (T D

i ). Therefore:

5 Of course, by a symmetry argument, they actually reduce to 4
diﬀerent distinct patterns (e.g. those in the ﬁrst column). We
will keep the classiﬁcation in 8 types for the sake of exposition.

where (also in what follows) sums span over j 6= i and
h 6= (i, j). In the ﬁrst line of eq. (8), the numerator of
the fraction is equal to tD
i , as it simply counts all possible
products of the form aij aihajh (cf. Fig. 1). To see that
T D
i = dtot
i − 1) − 2d↔
i , notice that i can be possibly
linked to a maximum of dtot
i (dtot
i −1)/2 pairs of neighbors
and with each pair can form up to 2 triangles (as the edge
between them can be oriented in two ways). This leaves
us with dtot
i − 1) triangles. However, this number
also counts “false” triangles formed by i and by a pair of
directed edges pointing to the same node, e.g. i → j and
j → i. There are d↔
i of such occurrences for node i, and
for each of them we have wrongly counted two “false”
triangles. Therefore, by subtracting 2d↔
from the above
i
number we get T D
i ∈ [0, 1]. The
i
N
i=1 CD
overall CC for BDNs is deﬁned as CD = N −1
i .
The CC in eq. (8) has two nice properties. First, if A
is symmetric, then CD
i (A) = Ci(A), i.e. it reduces to (1)
when networks are undirected. To see this, note that if
A is symmetric then dtot

Second, the expected value of CD

in random graphs,
where each edge is independently in place with proba-
bility p ∈ (0, 1) (i.e. aij are i.i.d. Bernoulli(p) random
variables), is still p (as happens for BUNs). Indeed, the
expected value of tD
is simply 4(N − 1)(N − 2)p3. Fur-

above can be easily extended to weighted graphs by re-
placing the number of directed triangles actually formed

i (W ) = ˜Ci(W ) for any symmetric W .
To compute expected values of ˜CD
i

in random graphs,
suppose that weights are drawn using the following two-
step algorithm. First, assume that any directed edge
i → j is in place with probability p (independently across
all possible directed edges). Second, let the weight wij
of any existing directed edge (i.e., in place after the ﬁrst
step) be drawn from an independent random variable uni-
formly distributed over (0,1]6. In this case, one has that

Clustering and Patterns of Directed Triangles. The CCs
for BDNs and WDNs deﬁned above treat all possible di-
rected triangles as they were the same, i.e. if directions
were irrelevant. In other words, both CD and ˜CD oper-
ate a symmetrization of the underlying directed graph in
such a way that the original asymmetric adjacency (resp.
weight) matrix A (resp. W ) is replaced by the symmetric
matrix A + AT (resp. W [ 1
3 ]). This means that
in the transformed graph, all directed edges are now bi-
lateral. Furthermore, in binary (respectively, weighted)
graphs, edges that were already bilateral count as two
(respectively, receive a weight equal to the sum of the
weights of the two directed edges raised to 1/3).

3 ] + (W T )[ 1

However, in directed graphs triangles with edges point-
ing in diﬀerent directions have a completely diﬀerent in-
terpretation in terms of the resulting ﬂow pattern. Look-
ing again at Figure 1, it is possible to single out four pat-
terns of directed triangles from i’s perspective7. These
are: (i) cycle, when there exists a cyclical relation among
i and any two of its neighbors (i → j → h → i, or vicev-
ersa); (ii) middleman, when one of i’s neighbors (say j)
both holds an outward edge to a third neighbor (say h)

4

(12)

(13)

(14)

and uses i as a medium to reach h in two steps8; (iii) in,
where i holds two outward edges; and (iv) out, where i
holds two inward edges.

When one is interested in measuring clustering in di-
rected networks, it is important to separately account for
each of the above patterns. This can be done by build-
ing a CC for each pattern (in both BDNs and WDNs).
As usual, each CC is deﬁned as the ratio between the
number of triangles of that pattern actually formed by
i and the total number of triangles of that pattern that
i can possibly form. Each CC will then convey infor-
mation about clustering of each diﬀerent pattern within
tightly connected directed neighborhoods. In order to do
that, we recall that the maximum number of all possible
directed triangles that i can form (irrespective of their
pattern) can be decomposed as:

In the case of weighted networks, it is straightforward
i with its weighted complement ˜t∗
to replace t∗
i , where the
adjacency matrix A has been replaced by W [ 1
3 ]. We then
accordingly deﬁne:

6 That is, wij is a random variable equal to zero with probability

1 − p and equal to a U (0, 1] with probability p.

7 Sets of topologically-equivalent subgraphs of a networks are also
called “motifs”, see Milo et al. (2002) and Onnela et al. (2005).

8 These patterns can be also labeled as “broken” cycles, where the
two neighbors whom i attempts to build a cycle with, actually
invert the direction of the ﬂow.

i = ˜Ci. Second, in random

Finally, network-wide clustering coeﬃcients C∗ and ˜C∗
can be built for any triangle pattern {cyc, mid, in, out}
by averaging individual coeﬃcients over the N nodes.
These aggregate coeﬃcients can be employed to compare
the relevance of, say, cycle-like clustering among diﬀer-
ent networks, but not to assess the relative importance of
cycle-like and middlemen-like clustering within a single
network.
In order to perform within-network compar-
isons, one can instead compute the fraction of all trian-
gles that belong to the pattern {∗} ∈ {cyc, mid, in, out}
in i’s neighborhood, that is:

f ∗

and then averaging them out over all nodes. Since for
i = 1 and
{∗} ∈ {cyc, mid, in, out} we have that
˜f ∗
i = 1, the above coeﬃcients can be used to mea-
sure the contribution of each single pattern to the overall
P
clustering coeﬃcient.

Empirical Application. The above concepts can be mean-
ingfully illustrated in the case of the empirical network
describing world trade among countries (i.e., the “world
trade network”, WTN in what follows). Source data is
provided by Gleditsch (2002) and records, for any given
year,
imports and exports from/to a large sample of
countries (all ﬁgures are expressed in current U.S. dol-
lars). Here, for the sake of exposition, we focus on year
2000 only (i.e.
the most recent year available in the
database)9. We choose to build an edge between any
two countries in the WTN if there is a non-zero trade
between them and we assume that edge directions follow
the ﬂow of commodities. Let xij be i’s exports to country
j and mji imports of j from i. In principle, xij = mji.
Unfortunately, due to measurement problems, this is not
the case in the database. In order to minimize this prob-
lem, we will focus here on “adjusted exports” deﬁned as
eij = (xij + mji)/2 and we build a directed edge from
country i to country j if and only if country i’s adjusted

5

exports to country j are positive. Thus, the generic entry
of the adjacency matrix aij is equal to one if and only
if eij > 0 (and zero otherwise). Notice that, in general,
eij 6= eji. In order to weight edges, adjusted exports can
be tentatively employed. However, exporting levels are
trivially correlated with the “size” of exporting/ import-
ing countries, as measured e.g. by their gross domestic
products (GDPs). To avoid such a problem, we ﬁrstly as-
sign each existing edge a weight equal to ˜wij = eij/GDPi,
where GDPi is country i’s GDP expressed in 2000 U.S.
dollars. Secondly, we deﬁne the actual weight matrix as:

W = {wij} =

,

(17)

˜wij

maxN

h,k=1{ ˜whk}

to have weights in the unit interval. Each entry wij tells
us the extent to which country i (as a seller) depends
on j (as a buyer). The out-strength of country i (i.e.
i’s exports-to-GDP ratio) will then measure how i (as
a seller) depends on the rest of the world (as a buyer).
Similarly, in-strengths denote how dependent is the rest
of the world on i (as a buyer)10.

The resulting WTN comprises N = 187 nodes / coun-
tries and 20105 directed edges. The density is there-
fore very high (δ = 0.5780). As expected, the binary
WTN is substantially symmetric: there is a 0.9978 corre-
lation between in- and out-degree (see Figure 2) and the
(non-scaled) S-index introduced in Fagiolo (2006) is close
to zero (0.00397), indicating that the underlying binary
graph is almost undirected.

FIG. 2 WTN: In- vs. out-degree in the binary case.

Thus, in the binary case, there seems to be no value
added in performing a directed analysis: since A is al-
most symmetric, we should not detect any signiﬁcant
diﬀerences among clustering indices for our four directed

9 This also allows us to keep our discussion similar to that in

Saramaki et al. (2006).

10 Dividing by GDPj would of course require a complementary
analysis. Notice also that Saramaki et al. (2006) deﬁne adjusted
exports as e(i, j) = e(j, i) = [x(i, j) + m(j, i) + x(j, i) + m(i, j)]/2,
thus obtaining an undirected binary/weighted network by con-
struction.

while CD
cyc = 0.8142,
cyc = 0.8108. The fact that CD >> δ also indicates
CD
that the binary (directed) WTN is much more clustered
than a random graph. Finally, Figure 3 shows that indi-
vidual CCs (CD
i ) are negatively correlated with total de-
gree (dtot
i ). This implies that countries with few (respec-
tively, many) partners tend to form very (respectively,
poorly) connected clusters of trade relationships.

First, unlike in the binary case, the overall average CC
( ˜CD) is now very low (0.0007) and signiﬁcantly smaller
than its expected value in random graphs (0.2438).

Second, ˜CD
i

is now positively correlated with total
strength (the correlation coeﬃcient is 0.6421), cf. Fig-
ure 6. This means that, when weight heterogeneity is
taken into account, the implication we have drawn in the
binary case is reversed: countries that are more strongly
connected tend to form more strongly connected trade
circles. Indeed, ˜CD
exhibits an almost null correlation
i
with total degree, see Figure 7.

The binary network does not take into account the het-
erogeneity of export ﬂows carried by edges in the WTN.
Indeed, when one performs a WDN analysis on the WTN,
the picture changes completely. To begin with, note that
weights wij are on average very weak (0.0009) but quite
heterogeneous (weight standard deviation is 0.0073). In
fact, weight distribution is very skewed and displays a
characteristic power-law shape (see Figure 4) with a slope
around -2.

Edge Weight (Logs)

FIG. 4 WTN: Log-log plot of the weight distribution.

The matrix W is now weakly asymmetric. As Figure
5 shows, in- and out-strengths are weakly correlated: the
correlation coeﬃcient is 0.09 (not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent
from zero). Nevertheless, the (not-scaled) S-index is still
very low (0.1118), suggesting that an undirected analysis
would still be appropriate. We will see now that, even
in this borderline case, a weighted directed analysis of
CCs provides a picture which is much more precise than

Third, despite the weighted network is only weakly
asymmetric, there is a substantial diﬀerence in the way
clustering is coupled with exports and imports. ˜CD
i dis-
plays a sort of U-shaped behavior when plotted against
in-strength (Figure 8), while a positive slope is still in
place when ˜CD
is plotted against out-strength. Hence,
i
the low clustering level of weakly connected countries
seems to depend mainly on their weakly exporting re-
lationships.

Fourth, weighted CC coeﬃcients associated to diﬀerent
triangle patterns now show a relevant heterogeneity: ˜C∗
range from 0.0004 (cycles) to 0.0013 (out). In addition,
cycles only account for 18% of all triangles, while the

other three patterns account for about 27% each. There-
fore, countries tend to form less frequently trade cycles,
possibly because they involve economic redundancies.

Finally, CCs for diﬀerent triangle patterns correlate
with strength measures in diﬀerent ways. While ˜Ccyc

˜Cmid

Concluding remarks. In this paper, we have extended the
clustering coeﬃcient (CC), originally proposed for binary
and weighted undirected graphs, to directed networks.
We have introduced diﬀerent versions of the CC for both
binary and weighted networks. These coeﬃcients count
the number of triangles in the neighborhood of any node
independently of their actual pattern of directed edges.
In order to take edge directionality fully into account,
we have deﬁned speciﬁc CCs for each particular directed
triangle pattern (cycles, middlemen, ins and outs). For
any CC, we have also provided its expected value in ran-
dom graphs. Finally, we have illustrated the use of di-
rected CCs by employing world trade network (WTN)
data. Our exercises show that directed CCs can describe
the main clustering features of the underlying WTN’s
architecture much better than their undirected counter-
parts.

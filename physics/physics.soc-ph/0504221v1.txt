Abstract

We investigate LIBOR-based derivatives using a parsimonious ﬁeld theory interest rate

model capable of instilling imperfect correlation between diﬀerent maturities. Delta and

Gamma hedge parameters are derived for LIBOR Caps and Floors against ﬂuctuations in

underlying forward rates. An empirical illustration of our methodology is also conducted to

demonstrate the inﬂuence of correlation on the hedging of interest rate risk.

1 Introduction

LIBOR-based derivatives such as Caps and Floors are important ﬁnancial contracts involving a

sequence of quarterly payments ranging from one to ten years. Consequently, pricing and hedging

such derivatives requires the modeling of multiple LIBOR rates.

In an economy where LIBOR rates are perfectly correlated across diﬀerent maturities, a single

volatility function is suﬃcient. However, non-parallel movements in the LIBOR term structure in-

troduce an important complication. To reduce the number of necessary inputs, volatility parameters

1

within certain time intervals are often assumed to be identical. However, this assumption repre-

sents a serious compromise, and longer maturity options still require a large number of volatility

parameters even after such aggregation.

In light of this issue, we utilize ﬁeld theory models introduced by Baaquie [2] to instill imperfect

correlation between LIBOR maturities as a parsimonious alternative to the existing theory. We

derive the corresponding hedge parameters for LIBOR Caplets for applications to risk management.

We then demonstrate the ease at which our formulation is implemented and the implications of

correlation on the hedge parameters.

Hedge parameters that minimize the risk associated with a ﬁnite number of random ﬂuctuations

in forward rates is provided in Baaquie, Srikant, and Warachka [3]. Previously, ﬁeld theory research

has focused on applications involving traditional Heath, Jarrow, and Morton [10] forward rates, and

on the pricing of LIBOR-based derivatives [5]. This paper extends the concept of stochastic delta

hedging developed in [2] to the hedging of LIBOR derivatives.

The remainder of this paper starts with the review of the ﬁeld theory model for pricing LIBOR

derivatives. Section 3 then investigates their corresponding hedge parameters, while Section 4

details their empirical implementation. The conclusion follows in Section 5.

2 Field Theory Model

The introduction of imperfect correlation between all underlying LIBOR rates is accomplished by

the speciﬁcation of a propagator for interest rate dynamics. In terms of notation, L(t, T ) denotes

the LIBOR rate at the current time t between time T and T + ℓ in the future where ℓ = 1/4 year

denotes the standard 3-month time interval between payoﬀs.

Since forward rates are the basis for LIBOR rates, we ﬁrst detail the Lagrangian underlying the

evolution of forward rates. Let A(t, x) be a two dimensional ﬁeld driving the evolution of forward

rates f (t, x) through time

∂f (t, x)
∂t

= α(t, x) + σ(t, x)A(t, x)

(1)

where σ(t, x) and α(t, x) denote their volatility and drift velocity respectively.

Following Baaquie and Bouchaud [4], the Lagrangian of the ﬁeld is deﬁned by three parameters.

The Lagrangian in Deﬁnition 2.1 contains a squared Laplacian term that describes the stiﬀness of

the forward rate curve. Baaquie and Bouchaud [4] demonstrate that this formulation is empirically

able to account for the phenomenology of interest rate dynamics. Ultimately, our pricing formulae

for Caps and Floors stems from a volatility function and correlation parameters µ, λ and η contained

in the propagator, as well as the initial term structure.

The associated Action S[A] of the Lagrangian is deﬁned as

normalizing constant equal to the path integral Z =

These forward rate dynamics are ultimately invoked for the pricing of Caps and Floors after

expressing derivatives on interest rates in terms of their counterparts on bonds.

2.1 LIBOR Dynamics

The following relationship between the forward interest rates and the LIBOR term structure

In the original Heath, Jarrow, and Morton model [10], the martingale measure is deﬁned by

discounting Treasury Bonds denoted B(t, T ) by the money market account R(t, t
∗

), deﬁned as

for the spot rate of interest denoted r(t). In this paper, all computations are carried out using the

LIBOR measure for which LIBOR rates evolve as martingales. In other words, for t

As proved in Baaquie [5], a money market numeraire entails more complex calculations but

arrives at identical prices if one instead uses the LIBOR measure. For the remainder of this paper,

the subscript of L is suppressed with all expectations performed under the LIBOR measure.

2.2 Pricing an Individual Caplet

The existing literature justiﬁes the Black model for pricing Caps and Floors by modifying risk

neutral Heath, Jarrow, and Morton [10] forward rates to yield LIBOR dynamics under the forward

measure. Brace, Gatarek, and Musiela [6] is the seminal paper in this area, with additional details

found in Musiela and Rutkowski [12].

We review the ﬁeld theory pricing formula for a Caplet for both a general volatility function

σ(t, T ) and propagator D(x, x

; t) underlying risk neutral forward rates [2]. Denote the principal

′

amount of the Cap as V . If the Caplet is exercised at time T , the payment is made in arrears at

time T + ℓ. Hence the payoﬀ function at time T + ℓ is given by

g(T + ℓ) = ℓV (L(T, T )

K)+

−

where K denotes the strike rate of the Caplet. Note that before discounting the payoﬀ at time T ,

we ﬁrst discount from T + ℓ back to time T . The entire expression for the Caplet price is given by

Caplet(t, T ) = B(t, T )E[t,T ] [B(T, T + ℓ)g(T + ℓ)]

3 Stochastic Delta Hedging

Stochastic hedging of interest rate derivatives has been introduced by Baaquie [2], where the speciﬁc

case of hedging Treasury Bonds is considered in detail. We focus on applying this technique to the

hedging of LIBOR Caplets. Consider the hedging of a Cap against ﬂuctuations in the forward rate

f (t, x). A portfolio Π(t) composed of a Cap(t0, t
∗

, Tn)1 and a LIBOR futures contract chosen to

ensure ﬂuctuations in the value of the portfolio are minimized is studied.

We begin by forming the portfolio

Π(t) = Cap(t, t
∗

, Tn) + n1(t)

(t, Tn1) ,

F

where n1(t) represents the hedge parameter for the futures contract. The LIBOR futures and Cap

prices are denoted by

The portfolio is required to be independent of small changes in the forward rate. Thus, Delta

hedging this portfolio requires

∂
∂f

Π(t) = 0 .

In ﬁeld theory, for each time t, there are inﬁnitely many random variables driving forward rates,

and one can never Delta hedge by satisfying equation 20. The best alternative is to Delta hedge

on average, and this scheme is referred to as stochastic Delta hedging, as detailed in [2]. To

implement stochastic Delta hedging, one considers the conditional expectation value of the portfolio

Π(t), conditioned on the occurrence of some speciﬁc value of the forward rate f (t, xh), namely

E[Π(t)

f (t, xh)]. Finite time Delta hedging can be deﬁned by hedging against the ﬂuctuations of

the forward rate f (th, xh)

are only on the average sensitive to the ﬂuctuation in the forward rate f (th, xh).

The hedging weight n1 is evaluated explicitly for the ﬁeld theory forward rates in the Appendix

which contains the relevant notation. The ﬁnal result, from equation 34 is given by

hedging. These parameters are solved analytically, with empirical results presented in Section 4.

Suppose a Cap needs to be hedged against the ﬂuctuations of N forward rates, namely f (th, xi)

and the stochastic Delta hedging conditions are given by

E[Π(th)

f1, f2, . . . , fN ] = 0 for j = 1, 2, . . . , N .

One can solve the above system of N simultaneous equations to determine the N hedge parameters

denoted ni. The volatility of the hedged portfolio is reduced by increasing N.

To illustrate Delta hedging against more than 1 forward rate, we construct a portfolio with 3

LIBOR futures maturities. Thus, we have equation 25 with N = 3.

Clearly, the three hedging parameters are ﬁxed by Delta hedging twice

E[Π(th)

and an additional cross Gamma term

∂2
∂f1∂f2

E[Π(th)

f1, f2] = 0 .

|

These hedge parameters are evaluated explicitly in the Appendix. Intuitively, we expect the portfolio

to be hedged more eﬀectively with the inclusion of the cross Gamma parameter.

Analytically, Delta hedge parameters for two diﬀerent forward rates diﬀers only by a prefactor.

Thus, all three parameters cannot be uniquely solved. Therefore, we construct a portfolio with two

LIBOR futures maturities, then ﬁx the parameters by Delta hedging and cross Gamma hedging

once. This environment is studied numerically in the next section.

Until now, we get the parameter for each choice of the LIBOR futures and forward rates being

hedged. Furthermore, we can minimize the following

N

i=1
X

ni|

|

(26)

to ﬁnd the minimum portfolio. This additional constraint ﬁnds the most eﬀective futures contracts,

where eﬀectiveness is measured according to the least amount of required buying or selling.

In general, stochastic Delta hedging against N forward rates for large N is complicated, and

closed-form solutions are diﬃcult to obtain.

4 Empirical Implementation

This section illustrates the implementation of our ﬁeld theory model and provides preliminary

results for the impact of correlation on the hedge parameters. The correlation parameter for the

propagator of LIBOR rates are estimated from historical data on LIBOR futures and at-the-money

options. We calibrate the term structure of the volatility, σ(θ), (see [7], [8]) and the propagator

with the parameters λ and µ as in Baaquie and Bouchaud [4].

Stochastic hedging only mitigates the risk of ﬂuctuations in speciﬁed forward rates. The focus

of this section is on the stochastic hedge parameters, with the best strategy chosen to ensure the

LIBOR futures portfolio involves the smallest possible long and short positions. As an illustration,

ﬁg 1 plot the hedge parameters against the LIBOR futures maturity, and the forward rate being

hedged.

Figure 1: Hedge parameter for stochastic Delta hedging of Cap(t, 1, 4).

We ﬁrst study a portfolio with one LIBOR futures and one Cap to hedge against a single term

structure movement. Hedge parameters for diﬀerent LIBOR futures contract maturities, and the

maturity of the forward rate, are shown in ﬁg 1. This ﬁgure describes the selection of the LIBOR

futures in the minimum portfolio that requires the fewest number of long and short positions.

Fig 2 shows how the hedge parameters depend on xh for a ﬁxed Tn1. Two limits Tn1 = δ = 1

4 (3
months) and Tn1 = 16δ are chosen. We also ﬁnd that xh = δ is always the most important forward

rate to hedge against. Another graph describing the parameter dependence on Tn1 is given in ﬁg 3

with xh = δ. For greater generality, we also hedge Cap(t, t
∗

, Tn) for diﬀerent t
∗

and Tn values, and

ﬁnd that although the value of the parameter changes slightly, the shape of the parameter surface

is almost identical.

One advantage of the ﬁeld theory model is that, in principle, a hedge strategy against the

movements of inﬁnitely many correlated forward rates is available. To illustrate the contrast between

our ﬁeld theory model and a single-factor HJM model, we plot the identical hedge portfolio as above

when D = 1, which has been shown to be the HJM limit of ﬁeld theory models in [2]. From ﬁg

4, the hedge parameters are invariant to maturity, which is expected since all forward rates are

perfectly correlated in a single-factor HJM model. Therefore, it makes no diﬀerence which of the

forward rates is being hedged.

In ﬁg 5, we investigate hedging with two LIBOR futures by employing both Delta and cross

Gamma hedging. From the previous case, we can hedge against f (t, δ) in order to obtain a minimum

portfolio involving the least amount of short and long positions. The diagonal reports that two

LIBOR futures with the same maturity reduces to Delta hedging with one LIBOR futures. Selling

38 contracts of L(t, t + 6δ) and buying 71 L(t, t + δ) contracts identiﬁes the minimum portfolio.

In addition, we consider hedging ﬂuctuations in two forward rates. Speciﬁcally, we study a

portfolio comprised of two LIBOR futures and one Caplet where the parameters are ﬁxed by Delta

hedging and cross Gamma hedging. The result is displayed in ﬁg 6 where we hedge against two short

maturity forward rates, such as f (t, δ) and f (t, 2δ). Buying 45 contracts of L(t, t + 15δ) and selling

25 L(t, t + 3δ) contracts forms the minimum portfolio. Fig 5 and ﬁg 6 result from the summation of

hedge parameters (as in equation 26) which depends on the maturities of the LIBOR futures. The

corresponding empirical results are consistent with our earlier discussion.3

3If we choose the hedged portfolio by minimizing

N
i=1 ni, we ﬁnd that the minimum portfolio requires 1500

contracts (long the short maturity and short their long maturity counterparts).

5 Conclusion

LIBOR-based Caps and Floors are important ﬁnancial instruments for managing interest rate risk.

However, the multiple payoﬀs underlying these contracts complicates their pricing as the LIBOR

term structure dynamics are not perfectly correlated. A ﬁeld theory model which allows for imper-

fect correlation between every LIBOR maturity overcomes this diﬃculty while maintaining model

parsimony.

Furthermore, hedge parameters for the ﬁeld theory model are provided for risk management

applications. Although the ﬁeld theory model implies an incomplete market since hedging cannot

be conducted with an inﬁnite number of interest rate dependent securities in practice, the correlation

structure between LIBOR rates is exploited to minimize risk. An empirical illustration demonstrates

the implementation of our model.

The domain of integration is given in ﬁgs 7 and 8. It can be seen that the unconditional probability

distribution for the Cap and LIBOR futures yields volatilities q2 and D respectively. Hence the
conditional expectation reduces the volatility of Cap by B2

A for the LIBOR futures.
This result is expected since the constraint imposed by the requirement of conditional probability

A , and by B2

reduces the allowed ﬂuctuations of the instruments.

It could be the case that there is a special maturity time xh that causes the largest reduction of

the conditional variance. The answer is found by minimizing the conditional variance

The exponential volatility function given in equation 35 has the remarkable property, similar to the

case found for the hedging of Treasury Bonds [2], that

Hence, the conditional probability for the LIBOR futures is deterministic. Indeed, once the forward

rate fh is ﬁxed, the following identity is valid

Q2
1(hjm) = Dhjm −

B2

Ahjm ≡

0 .

(36)

(37)

In other words, for the volatility function in equation 35, the LIBOR futures for the HJM model is

exactly determined by one of the forward rates.

But the conditional probability for the Cap is not deterministic since the volatility from th to

, before the Cap’s expiration, is not compensated for by ﬁxing the forward rate.

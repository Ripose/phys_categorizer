Abstract

We investigate the relative market eﬃciency in ﬁnancial market data, using the approximate

entropy(ApEn) method for a quantiﬁcation of randomness in time series. We used the global

foreign exchange market indices for 17 countries during two periods from 1984 to 1998 and from

1999 to 2004 in order to study the eﬃciency of various foreign exchange markets around the

market crisis. We found that on average, the ApEn values for European and North American

foreign exchange markets are larger than those for African and Asian ones except Japan. We also

found that the ApEn for Asian markets increase signiﬁcantly after the Asian currency crisis. Our

results suggest that the markets with a larger liquidity such as European and North American

foreign exchange markets have a higher market eﬃciency than those with a smaller liquidity such

as the African and Asian ones except Japan.

INTRODUCTION

Recently, the complex features of ﬁnancial time series have been studied using a variety

of methods developed in econophysics [1-3]. The analysis of extensive ﬁnancial data has

empirically pointed to the breakdown of the Eﬃcient Market Hypothesis(EMH), in partic-

ular, the weak-form of EMH [4-6, 12]. For example, the distribution function of the returns

of various ﬁnancial time series is found to follow a universal power law distribution with

varying exponents [4-6]. The returns of ﬁnancial time series without apparent long-term

memory are found to possess one in absolute value series, indicating a long-term memory in

the volatility of ﬁnancial time series [7,8,9,11].

In this paper, we use a method developed in statistical physics to test the market eﬃciency

of the ﬁnancial time series. The Approximate Entropy(ApEn) proposed by Pincus et al.

can be used to quantify the randomness in the time series [16, 17]. The ApEn can not only

quantify the randomness in ﬁnancial time series with a relatively small number of data but

also be used as a measure for the stability of time series [18]. Previously, the Hurst exponent

was used to analyze various global ﬁnancial time series, which suggested that the mature

markets have features diﬀerent from the emerging markets [9, 12]. It was also shown that

the liquidity and market capitalization may play an important role in understanding the

market eﬃciency [10]. Using the ApEn, we study the market eﬃciency of the global foreign

exchange markets. We use the daily foreign exchange rates for 17 countries from 1984 to

1998, and ones for 17 countries from 1999 to 2004 around the Asian currency crisis.

We found that the ApEn values for European and North American foreign exchange

markets are larger than those for African and Asian ones except Japan. We also found

that the market eﬃciency of Asian foreign exchange markets measured by ApEn increases

signiﬁcantly after the Asian currency crisis.

In Section II, we describe the ﬁnancial data used in this paper and introduce the ApEn

method. In Section III, we apply the ApEn method to global foreign exchange rates and

investigate the relative eﬃciency of the diverse foreign exchange markets. Finally, we end

with a summary.

II. DATA AND METHOD

A. DATA

We investigate the market eﬃciency of the ﬁnancial time series for various foreign ex-

change markets. For this purpose, we use the return series of daily foreign exchange rates for

17 countries from 1984 to 1998 (Data A) and from 1999 to 2004 (Data B). The Data A and

Data B are obtained before and after the Asian crisis, respectively. The data are grouped

into European, North American, African, Asian and Paciﬁc countries (from the FRB web

site). The returns of the ﬁnancial time series are calculated by a log-diﬀerence and properly

normalized, respectively. The normalized return Rt at a given time t is deﬁned by

rt = ln Pt − ln Pt−1, Rt =

ln Pt − ln Pt−1
σ(rt)

,

where Pt is the daily foreign exchange rate time series, rt the return time series after a

log-diﬀerence, and σ(rt) the standard deviation of the return.

B. Approximate Entropy(ApEn)

Pincus et al. proposed the Approximate Entropy(ApEn) to quantify the randomness

inherent in time series data [16, 17]. Recently, Pincus and Kalman applied the ApEn

method to a variety of ﬁnancial time series in order to investigate various features of the

market, in particular, the randomness [18]. The ApEn is deﬁned as follows:

ApEn(m, r) = Φm(r) − Φm+1(r),

where m is the embedding dimension, r the tolerance in similarity. The function Φm(r) is

given by

Φm(r) = (N − m + 1)−1

ln[C m

i (r)],

N −m+1

X
i=1

C m

i (r) =

Bi(r)
(N − m + 1)

,

3

where Bi(r) is the number of data pairs within a distance r,

The distance d[x(i),x(j)] between two vectors x(i) and x(j) in Rm is deﬁned by

Bi = d[x(i), x(j)] ≤ r.

d[x(i), x(j)] = max

(|u(i + k − 1) − u(j + k − 1)|),

k=1,2,..,m

where u(k) is a time series.

The ApEn value compares the relative magnitude between repeated pattern occurrences

for the embedding dimensions, m and m+1. When the time series data have a high degree

of randomness, the ApEn is large. On the other hand, ApEn is small for the time series with

a low degree of randomness. Therefore, the ApEn can be used as a measure of the market

eﬃciency.

III. RESULTS

In this section, we investigate the relative market eﬃciency for various foreign exchange

markets. We measure the randomness in ﬁnancial time series using the approximate entropy

(ApEn) method. We analyze the ApEn values for the global foreign exchange rates in the

Data(A) and Data(B) deﬁned in Section II. FIG. 1 shows the ApEn values for the foreign

exchange rates of Data A before the Asian currency crisis. The red, pink, yellow, green,

and blue colors denote the European, North American, African, Asian, and Paciﬁc foreign

exchange markets, respectively. We found that the average ApEn for European foreign

exchange rates is 2.0 and the ApEn for North American one is 1.98, which are larger than

the ApEn values for Asian ones with 1.1 (except Japan), and African ones with 1.52. The

ApEn for the Paciﬁc foreign exchange rates is 1.84, which is intermediate between two groups.

This is due to the liquidity or trading volumes in European and North American foreign

exchange markets, which are much larger than those for other foreign exchange markets.

The market with a larger liquidity such as European and North American foreign exchange

markets shows a higher market eﬃciency than the market with a smaller liquidity such as

Asian (except Japan) and African foreign exchange markets. In order to estimate the change

in market eﬃciency after the market crisis, we investigate the ApEn for the foreign exchange

rates of Data B after the Asian currency crisis. FIG.2 shows the ApEn values for Data B.

color bars correspond to European, North American, African, Asian and Paciﬁc countries, respec-

tively.

We found that the average ApEn values for European and North American foreign exchange

markets does not change much from the case of Data A. However, the ApEn values for Asian

increased sharply from 1.1 to 1.5 after the Asian currency crisis, indicating the improved

market eﬃciency. Note that the ApEn of Paciﬁc foreign exchange rates is 1.92, which is

close to ones for European and North American markets. Notably, the ApEn of the Korean

foreign exchange market increased sharply from 0.55 to 1.71 after the Asian currency crisis.

This is because the volatility of the Korean foreign exchange market is the largest among

17 countries during the Asian currency crisis. Our results suggest that the ApEn can be a

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we have investigated the degree of randomness in the time series of various

foreign exchange markets. We employed the Approximate Entropy (ApEn) to quantify a

market eﬃciency in the foreign exchange markets. We found that the average ApEn values

for European and North American foreign exchange markets are larger than those for African

and Asian ones except Japan, indicating a higher market eﬃciency for European and North

American foreign exchange markets than other foreign exchange markets. We found that the

eﬃciency of markets with a small liquidity such as Asian foreign exchange markets improved

signiﬁcantly after the Asian currency crisis. Our analysis can be extended to other global

ﬁnancial markets.

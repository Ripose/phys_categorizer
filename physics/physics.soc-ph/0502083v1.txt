Abstract

We analyze a set of three databases at diﬀerent levels of aggregation (i) a database of approxi-
mately 106 publications of 247 countries in the period between 1980–2001. (ii) A database of 508

academic institutions from European Union (EU) and 408 institutes from USA in the 11 year pe-

riod between during 1991–2001. (iii) A database comprising of 2330 Flemish authors in the period

1980–2000. At all levels of aggregation we ﬁnd that the mean annual growth rates of publications

is independent of the number of publications of the various units involved. We also ﬁnd that the

standard deviation of the distribution of annual growth rates decays with the number of publica-

tions as a power law with exponent ≈ 0.3. These ﬁndings are consistent with those of recent studies

of systems such as the size of R&D funding budgets of countries, the research publication volumes

of US universities, and the size of business ﬁrms.

INTRODUCTION

One outcome of World War II and the role science and technology (S&T) played in that

conﬂict was a heightened awareness on the part of policy makers of how developments in

science and technology aﬀect the security, economic development, and public good of a nation

(Durlauf, 1996; Chandler, 1962; Gort, 1962). Since that time, science and technology studies

focusing on the complex relationships inﬂuencing research, development, and innovation

have produced many policy-relevant results. Vannevar Bush’s ground-breaking Report to the

President on a Program for Postwar Scientiﬁc Research (based on the linear model presented

in (National Science Board, 2000); Mansﬁeld 1991; Jaﬀe 1996) dominated policy thinking in

the period after World War II but, within the knowledge industry, emerging new concepts—

such as the national innovation system—have highlighted the complex interactions between

research, development, and innovation and have clariﬁed their economic and social relevance

(Durlauf, 1995).

It is now clear that R&D spending decisions e.g., how to partition funds among disciplines

(e.g. weighted toward life sciences or natural sciences ) or how much to spend on individ-

ual projects (e.g.spending for the human genome project or global warming or renewable

sources of energy) can dramatically impact the pattern of development, strongly inﬂuence

which advances occur ﬁrst and, if strategic decisions are haphazard, seriously jeopardize the

competitiveness of the entire S&T system (Pakes, 1996). These concerns are even more

pressing now than they were 50 years ago because

(i) the scale of the S&T systems and the available resources are now much larger,

(ii) scientiﬁc advances now take place much more rapidly,

(iii) cutting-edge research today is often multidisciplinary (e.g., in the new ﬁeld of bio-

informatics, biologists, mathematicians, and physicists sometimes cooperate and some-

(iv) research results and technological innovations have a stronger impact on economic

times compete), and

growth and competitiveness.

2

To make informed choices, decision makers need information that is timely, reliable, and

clear (Luwel, 1999). To answer these needs, the ﬁeld of quantitative S&T studies has gone

through a revolutionary period (CWTS, 2000) during which many new indicators have been

identiﬁed (Garﬁeld, 1979), but in spite of important advances, this is still an extremely

complex project with many unsolved questions. Indicators are, by deﬁnition, retrospective

and heuristic (National Science Board, 2000), and there are many diﬃculties associated

with the development of indicators (Moed, 1995; Plerou, 1999) that are general, robust, and

applicable (i) across diﬀerent S&T ﬁelds, (ii) for diﬀerent aggregation levels (from research

groups to entire countries), (iii) equally well for input and output measures.

Most bibliometric indicators are one-dimensional i.e., they analyze only one variable such

as R&D spending, number of publications, number of citations, or time evolution. Indica-

tors based on these variables (e.g., OECD S&T-indicators, NSF Science and Engineering

Indicators, EU Science and Technology Indicators) are well-known to policy-makers, but to

better understand the underlying processes driving the R&D system and how they impact

economic development, we need to better understand the relationships among these variables

and thus far, little work has been done in this area. Appropriate research could produce

more complex indicators that may enable us to more accurately predict the output and im-

pact of policy changes. Indeed, OECD has already stated that such “blue sky” indicators

are indispensable policy tools in a knowledge economy driven by research and technological

innovation. The approach adopted in this paper is inspired by (Derek de Solla Price, 1963)

who conceived science as a physical system. He aimed at simple laws, similar to those in

planetary physics discovered by Newton. Rather than applying laws from classical physics,

our goal is to develop more sophisticated R&D indicators by using concepts and tools re-

cently developed in the ﬁeld of statistical physics. Speciﬁcally, we will apply two of that

ﬁeld’s fundamental concepts: scaling and universality (Stanley, 1999).

Scaling and Universality

The utility of the “universality” concept can be explained through an analogy with the

Mendeleev periodic table of atomic elements. During the last century, Mendeleev noticed

3

that some elements shared similar physical and chemical properties. That observation

prompted him to organize the atomic elements known at that time into a table in which

atomic elements with similar properties occupy the same column. By organizing the ele-

ments into this table, Mendeleev found that some cells of this periodic table were left empty.

Later, those empty cells were found to correspond to newly-discovered atomic elements whose

chemical and physical properties were well-predicted by their position in the table.

Analogously, the study of critical phenomena in statistical physics has shown that the

phase transition of very diﬀerent systems—e.g., water at the critical point, a polymer at its

collapsing temperature, or a magnet undergoing a temperature change—could be classiﬁed

into a few classes, each class being described by the same scaling functions and the same

scaling laws.

This result motivates a question of fundamental importance: “Which features of this

microscopic inter-particle force are important for determining critical-point exponents and

scaling functions, and which are unimportant?” This question has been answered for physical

systems, but is still lacking an answer for other systems. The discovery of universality

in physical systems is also of great practical interest. Speciﬁcally, when studying a given

problem, one may pick the most tractable system to study and the results one obtains will

hold for all other systems in the same universality class.

Here we extend a recent study by (Plerou 1999; Moed 1999;) and investigate to what

extent the concept of scaling can (i) be used to study R&D systems by analyzing the publi-

cation output of academic research institutions and authors and (ii) lead to new and more

sophisticated indicators. Contrary to technological innovation, scientiﬁc knowledge is a pub-

lic good and researchers establish intellectual property for their results by publishing them.

The processes leading to new scientiﬁc knowledge are complex and, to a large extent, driven

by a government’s R&D-policy. This policy varies considerably over countries in areas such

as the total public investment in R&D, the priority setting between scientiﬁc disciplines, the

institutional organization (universities, public research institutes, etc.) and the way research

itself is funded (more or less competitively driven).

Growth of Organizations

Consider the annual growth rate of an organization’s size

g(t) ≡ log

= log S(t + 1) − log S(t),

(1)

S(t + 1)

(cid:18)

S(t) (cid:19)

where S(t) and S(t + 1) are the size of the organization being considered in the years t and

t + 1, respectively. The organization can be a business ﬁrm (Stanley, 1996; Amaral, 1997;

Buldyrev, 1997; Takayasu, 1998; Sutton, 2000; Wyart, 2002), a country (Canning, 1998), a

university research budget (Plerou, 1999), a voluntary social organization, or a bird species

(Keitt, 1998; Keitt, 2002). We expect that the statistical properties of the growth rate g

depend on S, since it is natural that the magnitude of the ﬂuctuations g will decrease with

S. We partition the growth rates into groups according to their sizes to test whether the

probability density conditioned on the size p(g|S) has the same functional form for all the

diﬀerent size groups (Stanley, 1996; Amaral, 1997; Buldyrev, 1997).

If the conditional distribution of growth rates has a functional form dependent on S,

we expect the standard deviation σ(S)—which is a measure of the width of p(g|S)—to be

dependent on S. Thus, if when we plot the scaled quantities

σ(S)p(g/σ(S)|S)

versus

g/σ(S)

all σ curves from the diﬀerent size groups collapse onto a single curve, then p(g|S) follows a

universal scaling (Amaral, 1997, Buldyrev, 1997)

(Amaral, 1998; Matia, 2004) discusses how the tent-shaped form of f can be interpreted by

a convolution of a log normal distributions and a Gaussian distribution. Interestingly, our

studies reveal that σ(S) decays as a power law Stanley (1996), Buldyrev (1997)

DATA FOR DIFFERENT LEVELS OF AGGREGATION

Data of Publication of Countries

We analyze a database consisting of the total annual publications of 247 countries be-

tween 1980–2001. We extract the data from the CD-ROM version of the Science Citation

Index (SCI) published by the Institute for Scientiﬁc Information (ISI) at Philadelphia, USA,

founded by Eugene Garﬁeld.

We count country publications in three distinct ways, which we illustrate with an example:

Consider one publication co-authored by researchers aﬃliated with four diﬀerent institutions

in three diﬀerent countries. Two of the study’s authors are aﬃliated with a particular US

institution, a third author to a second US institution, a fourth with a Dutch institution and

the last author with a Belgian institution. For this case, one can deﬁne at least four diﬀerent

assignments of the publication to the three countries involved.

In an ideal case, one would assign fractions of a paper to a country on the basis of the

proportion of authors from each country. Thus, in the example, 0.6 publications would be

assigned to the US, 0.2 to the Netherlands and 0.2 to Belgium. However, in the database

analyzed, authors are not tagged to institutions. Therefore, for multi-authored papers from

diﬀerent institutions, the distribution of authors among institutions or countries cannot

be determined.

In our study, publications were assigned to countries on the basis of the

geographic location of the authors’ institutions rather than that of the authors themselves.

Thus, three counting schemes can be applied. The ﬁrst is denoted as “fractional count.”

Since two institutions are located in the US, one in the Netherlands and one in Belgium,

1/2 of the paper is assigned to US, and 1/4 to each of the other two countries. This count

will be denoted as fractional count throughout this paper. A second, denoted as “integer

count, type I” assigns two publications to the US, one publication to the Netherlands and

one publication to Belgium. Finally, the third, denoted as “integer count type II” assigns

one publication each to the US, the Netherlands, and Belgium.

The fractional count deﬁnition has the advantage that it conserves the total number of

publications regardless of the number of authors. Our fractional count is not a perfect solu-

6

tion to the assignment of publications to countries as it is based on contributing institutions

rather then on individual contributors, but it is the best we are able to generate with the

data available. Moreover, at the level of countries, diﬀerences between a fractional assign-

ment based on institutions and that based on authors can be expected to level out to a

considerable extent. The two integer count deﬁnitions are important because they provide

a way to determine the weight of national and international collaborations on the research

of a country. In fact, type II integer counts reﬂect international collaboration, and type I

integer counts reﬂect institutional collaboration both at the national and the international

level.

By considering the three distinct counting methods for publications, we generate three

databases for analysis. From each of these databases we select the subset of countries which

had non-zero publications during the entire 22-year period. This procedure eliminates 123

countries—some of which were created during the observations period (due mainly to changes

in Eastern Europe and the disintegration of the USSR) and some with very low publication

rates—yielding 124 countries.

Data of Publication of Institutes

We analyze a database consisting of the total annual publications of 508 institutes from

European Union (EU) and 408 academic institutions from USA in the 11 year period be-

tween during 1991–2001. Publication by institutes is recorded according to the fractional

counting scheme described before. Publications were assigned to institutions on the basis

of the institutional aﬃliations of publishing authors, taking into account variations in the

institutions’ name.

Data of Publication of Flemish Authors

We analyze a database consisting of the total annual publications of 2330 authors between

1980–2001. The database contains articles, letters, notes and reviews in CDROM version of

SCI 1980-2000 Flemish researchers active in natural and life sciences who during 1991-2000

7

were member of a Committee or who submitted a proposal to the Flemish Research Council

FWO-Vlaanderen.

Publication by Flemish authors is recorded in two distinct ways, which we illustrate

with an example: Consider one publication co-authored by two diﬀerent researchers. Two

diﬀerent counting schemes can be applied. The ﬁrst is denoted as “fractional count” where

each author receives a score of 1/2. A second, denoted as “integer count” assigns to each

author each author a score of 1.

ANALYSIS

Countries

Figures 1 and 2 present results for the size distribution of the countries according to

the fractional counting schemes. Figure 1 displays the histogram of the logarithm of the

number of publications of 124 countries for the 22 year period between 1980–2001. We

observe that the distribution exhibits a bi-modal size distribution which implies that the

set of 124 countries can be divided into two classes. In the class with larger sizes we ﬁnd

countries from the European Union, the North American subcontinent, the Organization for

Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and populous countries such as India,

China, and South Africa.

In the class with smaller sizes we ﬁnd developing countries of

the African and South American continents and countries from the Middle East. The bi-

modal distribution suggests the existence of two diﬀerent classes of countries which have an

economic and scientiﬁc collaboration among themselves. Note that this result is diﬀerent

from that found for the GDP of growth of countries (Canning, 1998).

In terms of GDP

diﬀerent countries exhibit a uni-modal distribution, but we see that in terms of scientiﬁc

outputs, perhaps because of a more aggressive science policy, countries exhibit a bi-modal

distribution. Analysis applying the two integer counting schemes generated patterns that are

similar to that obtained with the fractional counting schemes. This feature is also indicative

of the scientiﬁc collaboration among diﬀerent countries in the two classes observed. One

expects that in the case where every country scientiﬁcally collaborates uniformly with every

8

other country there would not be any segregation into diﬀerent classes. The multiplicative

growth process in scientiﬁc publications is present in each of these two classes, giving rise

to a log-normal distribution, which is a prediction of Gibrat’s theory (Gibrat, 1931) which

states that growth rates of ﬁrms are independent and uncorrelated to the ﬁrm size and hence

the probability distribution of the ﬁrm sizes is log-normal.

We deﬁne the deﬂated size Si(t) of the publications of a country i as

Si(t) ≡

si(t)
N
i=1 si(t)

,

P
where N = 124 and si(t) is the number of publications of a country i in year t. The annual

growth rate of a country’s publication i is deﬁned as

gi(t) = log Si(t + ∆t) − log Si(t),

with ∆t = 1 year. We expect that the statistical properties of the growth rate g depend on

S, since it is natural that the magnitude of the ﬂuctuations g will decrease with S. We next

calculate the standard deviation σ(S) of the distribution of growth rates as a function of S.

Figure 2(a) demonstrates that σ(S) decays as a power law

with β = 0.32 ± 0.05. To test if the conditional distribution of growth rates has a functional

form independent of the size of the country, we plot the scaled quantities

σ(S) ∼ S−β,

for 3 diﬀerent groups partitioned with respect to their size of publication S: small (S < 10−4),
medium (10−4 < S < 10−2), and large (S > 10−2). Figure 2(b) shows that the scaled

conditional probability distributions collapse onto a single curve (Stanley, 1999), suggesting

(5)

(6)

(7)

(8)

that p(g|S) follows a universal scaling eq. 8.

FIGURE 1 AND 2 ABOUT HERE

Academic Institutions

We now present results for the size distribution of the institutional publication according

to the diﬀerent regions. Figure 3a displays the histogram of the logarithm of the number of

9

publications of 408 USA institutes for the 11 year period between 1991–2000. We observe

that the distribution, for EU institutions unlike the US institutions, exhibits a uni-modal

size distribution which was unlike that observed for publication of countries. Note that

this result is similar to that found for the GDP of growth of countries (Canning, 1998). A

possible conjecture of observing uni-modal distribution as opposed to a bi-modal distribution

of size is a more homogeneous collaboration among institutes. The multiplicative growth

process in scientiﬁc publications gives rise to a log-normal distribution, which is a prediction

of Gibrat’s theory. The distribution for US academic institutions exhibit a bi-modal rather

than a uni-modal pattern. The values of the scaling parameter β, however, are statistically

similar in the two academic systems [c. f. Table I].

FIGURE 3 AND 4 ABOUT HERE

Authors

Next we present results for the size distribution of the Flemish publication according

to the diﬀerent counting schemes. Figure 5 displays the histogram of the logarithm of the

number of publications of 2330 countries for the 21 year period between 1980–2000. We

observe that the distribution, for two diﬀerent counting schemes, exhibits a uni-modal size

distribution which was unlike that observed for publication of countries. Note that this

result is similar to that found for the GDP of growth of countries (Canning, 1998). In terms

of GDP diﬀerent countries exhibit a uni-modal distribution, and we see that in terms of

scientiﬁc outputs at the level of authors this feature is similar. This feature is also indicative

of the scientiﬁc collaboration among diﬀerent authors in a uniform way. One expects that

in the case where every author scientiﬁcally collaborates uniformly with every other author

there would not be any segregation into diﬀerent classes. The multiplicative growth process

in scientiﬁc publications gives rise to a log-normal distribution, which is a prediction of

Gibrat’s theory. Table I summarizes the estimates of scaling exponent β [c.f. eq. 4] for

diﬀerent levels of aggregation. We observe that for diﬀerent level of aggregation or for

diﬀerent counting schemes we get statistically similar values.

DEVIATION FROM SCALING LAWS FOR COUNTRIES

Next we look at the joint distribution of the relative growth rate and the relative deviation

of σ(S) from the scaling laws found in the previous section. First we deﬁne the mean
growth rate of a country j as gj
i , where gj
gj
i = 1980, ..., 2000. Next we evaluate the relative growth rate of country j as gj
where σj is the standard deviation of {gj

where C is a constant. We deﬁne δσ(Sj) = σ(Sj) − CS−0.37
and then evaluate σj
viation of {δσ(S1), .., δσ(S124)}, evaluated over 124 countries. The scatter plot of gj

≡ σrel(Sj) = δσ(Sj)/σ(δσ(Sj)), where σ(δσ(Sj)) is the standard de-

rel
would fall inside a circular region of 1 standard deviation for countries following the scaling
laws closely. Countries for which (gj

, σrel) falls outside the 2 standard deviation zone
can be hypothesized to pursue a diﬀerent science and technology policy than that pursued

vs. σj

by the rest of the world with 95% probability.

Figures 7 displays the relative growth rate grel plotted against the deviation of σ from

the best ﬁt line i.e., σrel. Circular lines in the plots mark the diﬀerent zones of standard
deviation in σrel and gj
rel. Countries falling outside the one standard deviation zone have

deviate signiﬁcantly from the mean properties of world scientiﬁc outputs. Countries falling

in the ﬁrst quadrant outside the one standard deviation zone in this plot have positive

growth, but the standard deviation in the growth rate implies that the ﬂuctuation in the

growth is high. Countries falling in the second quadrant have high positive growth and also

less standard deviation in growth, indicating a more stable growth process. Countries falling

outside the one standard deviation zone in this quadrant are quickly developing countries.

Scientiﬁc research from these countries may produce newer ﬁelds resulting in high positive

growth and bigger ﬂuctuations. Countries outside the one standard deviation zone in the

11

third quadrant are countries with strongly decaying science policies. Both the standard

deviation of growth and the growth is negative, suggesting a very strong decay. Countries in

the fourth quadrant outside the one standard deviation zone have higher standard deviation

in growth, but the growth itself is negative. The countries in this quadrant have a chance

to move over to the ﬁrst or second quadrant because of higher ﬂuctuations. These are the

newly developed countries which may be recently investing in scientiﬁc research.

FIGURE 7 ABOUT HERE

Figures 8 display the standard deviation σ of the growth rates of all 124 countries plotted

as a function of S, in two periods between 1981-1990 and 1991-2000 for (a) fractional, (b)

integer type I, (c) integer type II counting schemes. Comparison of scaling laws in these

two consecutive decades may be indicative of any policy or political regime changes that

countries possibly have undergone. We observe that the countries have identical scaling laws

in the two consecutive decade.

Next we study the deviation of σ(S) from the best ﬁt line in for the two 11 year periods

between (a) 1980-1990 and (b) 1991-2000 (c.f. Fig. 7, which is the entire 22 year period).

We observe that China and South Korea had a very high deviation of growth rate from the

average growth rate of world publication during the period 1980-1990. During the second

half of the analysis period we observe both countries as deviating less from the average world

publication grow rate. We also observe the growth rate of USA as becoming more stable and

moving inside the 1 standard deviation zone in the 2nd half of the analysis period. Dramatic

policy changes are also observed for countries such as Iran which shift from the negative 2

standard deviation zone to the positive 2 standard deviation zone during these two decades.

Developing countries such as India become more stable in terms of their science policy and

move inside the 1 standard deviation zone and countries such as Japan become more deviant

and more within to the 1 standard deviation zone.

DISCUSSION

We have described a research approach that may be quite new in the ﬁeld of scientiﬁc

policy and that may shed light on the behavior and characteristics of S&T systems. Under-

standing these processes and the data characterizing them is of great relevance not only for

S&T studies but also for science policy. Indeed, countries are increasingly stressing perfor-

mance because research funding is becoming more and more an instrument for safeguarding

long term economic competitiveness. Scientiﬁc research can be modeled as an input-output

process, according to which inputs such as the stocks of scientiﬁc knowledge and existing

techniques, skilled personnel, scientiﬁc instruments, recruited personnel, and ﬁnancial re-

sources, are transformed by conceptual, experimental, and technical work of scientists into

outputs, particularly scientiﬁc contributions, to a discipline in the form of new scientiﬁc

knowledge, techniques, and trained scientists.

Our study deals with scientiﬁc performance or scientiﬁc excellence. National governments,

particularly in OECD countries, make large investments in basic scientiﬁc research. During

the past decades, the need for accountability in scientiﬁc research and research student

training has increased strongly. As indicated earlier and observed empirically, this type of

aggressive science policy by a group of countries may be a cause of the bi-modal distribution

of sizes.

Our studies on the EU and the institutions reveal another special characteristic observed

within the EU but not in US institutions. The uni-modal size distribution is indicative of

a homogeneous collaboration among institutes of all size. A bi-modal distribution which is

observed in US institutions is indicative of a clustering eﬀect of institutes of two diﬀerent

size classes. Whether or not we observe this clustering eﬀect in collaboration among insti-

tutes in EU and USA the scaling parameter of growth remains statistically similar to that

observed for countries. It is indeed remarkable that for all levels of aggregation i.e., from

countries to research institutes to authors, the scaling parameter of growth as a function

of size remains statistically comparable. These important results observed in the scientiﬁc

output of countries and research institutes were not observed in the GDP of countries or

other S&T input output indicators like citation.

13

In our macroscopic analysis in which we study the statistical properties of the growth rates

in the annual number of articles published by a country, a certain statistical regularity was

found between a country’s standard deviation and its total volume of published articles. The

standard deviation as a function of the total number of articles published decays as a power

law. The exponent in the power law equation is denoted in statistical physics as the scaling

exponent. A closer inspection of the results reveals that for some countries, the standard

deviations in their annual growth rates deviate substantially from the expected scores given

by the total number of papers they published. The signiﬁcance of such a deviation and what

it can teach us about the eﬃciency of the various national research systems will be addressed

in the next phase of our research.

FIG. 1: Histogram of the logarithm of number of publications of 124 countries for the 21-year

period between 1980–2001 according to fractional counting scheme. The solid line is a Gaussian

ﬁt to the data, which is a prediction of Gibrat’s theory. We observe a bi-modal distribution in

the sizes of publication for all diﬀerent counting method of countries, which is indicative of two

diﬀerent sectors with respect to their size. Each of the two sectors grow in a multiplicative process

resulting in a log-normal distribution of sizes. This feature of size distribution is not observed in

the GDP of countries (Canning, 1998). The two integer counting scheme also gives similar results.

FIG. 3: Histogram of the logarithm of the institutional publication for (a) 408 USA institutes and

(b) 508 EUR institutes measured in the fractional counting scheme for the 11-year period between

1991–2001. The full lines are Gaussian ﬁts to the data, which is a prediction of Gibrat’s theory. For

EU academic institutions we observe a uni-modal distribution unlike that observed in distribution

of size of publication for countries. This feature of size distribution is also observed in the GDP of

countries Canning (1998).

FIG. 5: Histogram of the logarithm of the (a) fractional count, (b) integer count of number of

publications of 2330 Flemish authors for the 21-year period between 1980–2001. The full lines are

Gaussian ﬁts to the data, which is a prediction of Gibrat’s theory which states that growth rates

of ﬁrms are independent and uncorrelated to the ﬁrm size and hence the probability distribution

of the ﬁrm sizes is log-normal.

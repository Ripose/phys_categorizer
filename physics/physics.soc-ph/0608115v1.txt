Abstract

Based on the new type of random walk process called the Potentials of Unbalanced Complex

Kinetics (PUCK) model, we theoretically show that the price diﬀusion in large scales is ampliﬁed
2(2 + b)−1 times, where b is the coeﬃcient of quadratic term of the potential. In short time scales

the price diﬀusion depends on the size M of the super moving average. Both numerical simulations

and real data analysis of Yen-Dollar rates are consistent with theoretical analysis.

INTRODUCTION

Crashes and uncontrollable hikes can often occur in ﬁnancial markets. Such changes

of the prices confuse the market and damage the economy because they start abruptly in

many cases. Therefore, techniques to measure the probabilistic risk of sudden change in the

prices have been studied using tick-by-tick data [1]. Recently, it was empirically found that

change of prices can be approximated by the Fokker-Planck equation and the new type of

random walk in a potential ﬁeld [2,3,4,5]. The potential ﬁeld is approximated by a quadratic

function with its center given by the moving average of past market prices. This random

walk model is called the Potentials of Unbalanced Complex Kinetics (PUCK) model in which

the potential slowly changes in the market [3,4]. In this paper, we focus on the diﬀusion

properties of this random walk process and calculate the diﬀusion coeﬃcient which is helpful

for estimating the market risk.

We ﬁrst review an empirical derivation of the PUCK model. We next show that the

statistically steady condition of price ﬂuctuations depends on the potential ﬁeld, and clarify

relationships between the price diﬀusion and the potential ﬁeld. We ﬁnally demonstrate

that the price diﬀusion in short time scales depends on the size of moving average, however,

large scale diﬀusion properties are independent of the moving average.

In the paper, we

used all the Bid record (about 20 million ticks) of the exchange rates for Yen/Dollar that

were traded by the term from 1989 to 2002 to ﬁnd the ﬁrm statistical laws.

II. EMPIRICAL DERIVATION OF PUCK MODEL

Prices in ﬁnancial markets always have violent ﬂuctuation in a short time scale. We ﬁrst

eliminate the uncorrelated noise η(t) from the price P (t) in order to reduce the statistical

error. We next investigate the dynamics of the price.

We can perform this noise elimination process by introducing an optimum moving average

P (t):

P (t) = P (t) + η(t),

P (t) =

wk · P (t − k),

K

k=1

X

(2)

where P (t) is a price, η(t) is an uncorrelated noise and wk gives the weight factors where the

time is measured by ticks. The weight factors are calculated by using Yule-Walker equation

[6,7,8]. In a case of Yen-Dollar rate, the weight factor wk follows an exponential function

whose characteristic decay time is about 30 seconds [6].

We investigate a behavior of the optimum moving average P (t) obtained by eliminating

the uncorrelated noise η(t) from the price P (t). We introduce a super moving average PM (t)

deﬁned by

In ﬁnancial markets, it is found that the following relationship between P (t) and PM (t)

PM (t) =

P (t − τ ).

where the mean of noise f (t) is zero. The Eq.(4) means that the price change can be

approximated by a random walk in a quadratic potential ﬁeld whose center is given by the

moving average of past prices.

It is known that the potential coeﬃcient b(t) has a long

autocorrelation [3,4].

We focus on Eq.(4) with the case of a constant b because the coeﬃcient b(t) is known to

change slowly in ﬁnancial markets. Eq.(4) is transformed as follows,

P (t + 1) − P (t) = −

+ f (t). (5)

This is a type of AR process for price diﬀerence when b is a constant. We can estimate the

conditions of b to make the AR process being statistically steady. Eq.(5) is transformed by

If lim

= 0, the time series of P (t + 1) − P (t) is in a weakly steady state because Xt

becomes independent of the initial value of X0. This condition is fulﬁlled when the absolute

values of all eigenvalues of A are less than 1. For example, when M = 2 the time series

of P (t + 1) − P (t) is statistically steady if the potential coeﬃcient satisﬁes |b| < 2. When

M = 3 the eigenvalues of A are given by

Solving the steady state condition we ﬁnd that the potential coeﬃcient should be in the

range of −2 < b < 6 for M = 3. Numerically calculating the eigenvalues for 2 ≤ M ≤ 20

as shown in Fig.1 we ﬁnd that the time series of P (t + 1) − P (t) is statistically stationary if

the potential coeﬃcient is in the following range,

IV. DIFFUSION OF PRICES IN MARKET POTENTIAL FIELD

As the potential coeﬃcient b(t) has a long autocorrelation, we can calculate the future

price diﬀusion using Eq.(4). This prediction is crucial in order to evaluate the risks of market.

We clarify statistical laws of price diﬀusion described by Eq.(4) using both simulations and

theoretical analysis.

By simulating Eq.(4) for the case of b(t) is a constant, we investigate the standard devi-

(cid:29)

(cid:17)

In Fig.2 we plot σb(T ) for M = 4, 16, 64, 256 when b = −1.5 and b = 2. Here, f (t) is

the Gaussian random number whose standard deviation is 1. The time scale where the

Hurst exponent converges 0.5 depends on M. For example, the time scale is about 103 when

M = 256, while the time scale is around T = 20 when M = 4

We can estimate the standard deviation σb(T ) in the long time scale limit. The variance

of change of optimum moving average price P (t) is given by

P (t + T ) − P (t)

times by the potential ﬁeld. In Fig.3 we show relationships between the potential coeﬃcient

b and the ratio of standard deviation σb(T )/σb=0(T ) when T = 105 by simulating Eq.(4)

for M = 2, 4, 8, 16, 32. We can conﬁrm that the price diﬀusion of numerical simulations

follows Eq.(13) independent of M in the long time scale. From Eq.(13) we can theoretically

ﬁnd that in the long time scales the price diﬀusion is independent of M, independent of b,
σb(T ) ∝ T 0.5.

V. DIFFUSION OF YEN-DOLLAR RATES

From dataset of real market prices, we can estimate the value of b, and presume the best

value of M by comparing the price diﬀusion of numerical simulations to real price diﬀusion.

Fig.4 shows the diﬀusions of Yen-Dollar rates from 3:35 to 8:35 and from 9:25 to 23:25

in 11/9/2001, the day of terrorism. The rates were stable till 8:35 and it became quite

unstable after 9:25. The rates until 8:35 follow a slow diﬀusion in short time scales, namely,

the market has an attractive potential b > 0. As shown in Fig.4, we can recreate the rate

diﬀusion in all time scales by simulating Eq.(4) with b = 0.9 and M = 14 ticks. We next

focus on the unstable rates after 9:25 that follow a fast diﬀusion in short time scales. When

b = −0.8 and M = 14 ticks, the price diﬀusion of numerical simulation is also consistent

with the rate diﬀusion. The price diﬀusion depends on M in the short time scales, although

the price diﬀusion is independents of M in the long time scales. Therefore, if M 6= 14 ticks,

there are gaps between the price diﬀusion of numerical simulations and the rate diﬀusion in

the short time scales as shown in Fig.4. In other real markets, we can also estimate the best

value of M from such characteristics of price diﬀusion.

VI. DISCUSSION

We can approximate the change of market prices by the random walk in a potential ﬁeld.

The potential ﬁeld is well approximated by a quadratic function with its center given by the

moving average of past prices. The random walk process is called the PUCK model. By

analyzing the model, we clariﬁed that the statistically steady condition of price ﬂuctuations

6

depends on the potential coeﬃcient b, and we also theoretically proved that the price diﬀusion
in the long time scales is ampliﬁed 2(2 + b)−1 times, independent of the size M of super

moving average. In short time scales the price diﬀusion depends on M. We can estimate the

best value of M in real ﬁnancial markets by observing this dependence. We recreated the

diﬀusion of Yen-Dollar rates in all time scales by the PUCK model. The potential coeﬃcient

b is helpful to measure the probabilistic risk of sudden change in the prices. We may be able

to build better ﬁnancial options that oﬀset the risk by applying the price diﬀusion of the

PUCK model.

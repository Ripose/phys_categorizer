The eﬀects of an additional strategy or character called loner in the snowdrift game are studied
in a well-mixed population or fully-connected network and in a square lattice. The snowdrift game,
which is a possible alternative to the prisoner’s dilemma game in studying cooperative phenomena
in competing populations, consists of two types of strategies, C (cooperators) and D (defectors). In
a fully-connected network, it is found that either C lives with D or the loners take over the whole
population. In a square lattice, three possible situations are found: a uniform C-population, C lives
with D, and the coexistence of all three characters. The presence of loners is found to enhance
cooperation in a square lattice by enhancing the payoﬀ of cooperators. The results are discussed in
terms of the eﬀects in restricting a player to compete only with his nearest neighbors in a square
lattice, as opposed to competing with all players in a fully-connected network.

INTRODUCTION

The evolutionary prisoner’s dilemma game (PDG)
[1, 2, 3] and the snowdrift game (SG) [4] have be-
come standard paradigms for studying the possible emer-
gence of cooperative phenomena in a competitive setting.
Physicists ﬁnd such emergent phenomena fascinating, as
similar cooperative eﬀects are also found in interacting
systems in physics that can be described by some min-
imal models, e.g. models of interacting spin systems.
These games are also essential in the understanding of
coexistence of (and competition between) egoistic and
altruistic behavior that appear in many complex sys-
tems in biology, sociology and economics. The basic
PDG [5, 6] consists of two players deciding simultane-
ously whether to cooperate (C) or to defect (D). If one
plays C and the other plays D, the cooperator pays a cost
of S =
c while the defector receives the highest payoﬀ
T = b (b > c > 0). If both play C, each player receives
c > 0. If both play D, the payoﬀ is
a payoﬀ of R = b
P = 0. Thus, the PDG is characterized by the ordering of
the four payoﬀs T > R > P > S, with 2R > T + S. In a
single round of the game, it is obvious that defection is a
better action in a fully connected (well-ﬁxed) population,
regardless of the opponents’ decisions. Modiﬁcations on
the basic PDG are, therefore, proposed in order to induce
cooperations and to explain the wide-spread cooperative
behavior observed in the real world. These modiﬁcations
include, for example, the iterated PDG [1, 2], spatially
extended PDG [7, 8, 9, 10] and games with a third strat-
egy [11, 12, 13, 14].

The snowdrift game (SG), which is equivalent to the

∗Electronic address: dfzheng@zjuem.zju.edu.cn

hawk-dove or chicken game [4, 15], is a model somewhat
favorable for cooperation.
It is best introduced using
the following scenario [16]. Consider two drivers hur-
rying home in opposite directions on a road blocked by
a snowdrift. Each driver has two possible actions – to
shovel the snowdrift (cooperate (C)) or not to do any-
thing (not-to-cooperate or “defect” (D)). If they cooper-
ate, they could be back home earlier and each will get
a reward of b′. Shovelling is a laborious job with a to-
tal cost of c′. Thus, each driver gets a net reward of
c′/2. If both drivers take action D, they both
R = b′
get stuck, and each gets a reward of P = 0.
If only
one driver takes action C and shovels the snowdrift, then
both drivers can also go home. The driver taking action
D (not to shovel) gets home without doing anything and
hence gets a payoﬀ T = b′, while the driver taking action
C gets a “sucker” payoﬀ of S = b′
c′. The SG refers
to the case when b′ > c′ > 0, leading to the ranking of
the payoﬀs T > R > S > P . This ordering of the pay-
oﬀs deﬁnes the SG. Therefore, both the PDG and SG are
deﬁned by a payoﬀ matrix of the form

and they diﬀer only in the ordering of P and S. It is this
diﬀerence that makes cooperators persist more easily in
the SG than in the PDG. In a well-mixed population, co-
operators and detectors coexist. Due to the diﬃculty in
measuring payoﬀs and the ordering of the payoﬀs accu-
rately in real world situations where game theory is ap-
plicable [17, 18], the SD has been taken to be a possible
alternative to the PDG in studying emerging cooperative
phenomena [16].

The present work will focus on two aspects of cur-

in a competing population are better modelled by some
networks providing limited interactions than a fully-
connected network. Previous studies showed that diﬀer-
ent spatial structures might lead to diﬀerent behaviors
[7, 8, 19, 20, 21]. For example, it has been demonstrated
that spatial structures would promote cooperation in the
PDG [7, 8], but would suppress cooperation in the SG
[16]. There are other variations on the SG that resulted
in improved cooperation [22, 23]. Here, we explore the
eﬀects of an underlying network on the evolutionary SG
in a population in which there exists an additional type
of players. The latter is related to the fact that real-
world systems usually consist of people who would adopt
a strategy other than just C and D. For example, there
may be people who do not like to participate in the com-
petition and would rather take a small but ﬁxed payoﬀ.
Hauert et al. studied the eﬀects of the presence of such
persons, called loners [11, 12], in a generalization of the
PDG called the public goods game(PGG). Motivated by
these works of Hauert et al.
[11, 12, 16], we study the
eﬀects of risk averse loners in the evolutionary SG. In
our model, evolution or adaptation is built in by allow-
ing players to replace his character or strategy by that
of a better-performing connected neighbor. We focus on
both the steady state and the dynamics, and study how
an underlying network structure aﬀects the emergence of
cooperation.
It is found that in a fully-connected net-
work, the C-players and D-players cannot coexist with
the loners. In a square lattice, however, cooperators are
easier to survive. Depending on the payoﬀs, there are
situations in which C-players, D-players and loners can
coexist.

In Sec. II, the evolutionary SG with loners in a pop-
ulation with connections is presented.
III, we
present detailed numerical results in fully-connected net-
works and in square lattices, and discuss the physics of
the observed features. The eﬀects of noise are also dis-
cussed. We summarize our results in Sec. IV.

In Sec.

II. THE MODEL

We consider an evolutionary snowdrift game in which
the competitions between players are characterized by
the payoﬀ matrix

terms of 0 < r < 1, we have T = 1 + r, R = 1, S = 1
r,
and P = 0. A competition involving a loner leads to a
payoﬀ Q for both players. Here, we explore the range of
0 < Q < 1.

−

Spatial networking eﬀects and evolutions are incorpo-
rated into the SG as follows. At the beginning of the
game, the players are arranged onto the nodes of a net-
work and the character s(i) of each player is assigned ran-
domly among the choices of C, D, and L. Our discussion
will be mainly on fully-connected graphs and regular lat-
tices. In a fully-connected network, every player is con-
nected to all other players. In a square lattice, a player
is linked only to his four nearest neighbors. Numerical
studies are carried out using Monte Carlo simulations as
reported in the work of Szab´o et al. [13] (see also Refs.
[12, 14]). The evolution of the character of the players is
governed by the following dynamics. At any time during
the game, each player competes with all the players that
he is linked to and hence has a payoﬀ. A randomly cho-
sen player i reassesses his own strategy by comparing his
payoﬀ P (i) with the payoﬀ P (j) of a randomly chosen
connected neighbor j. With probability

W [s(i), s(j)] =

,

P (j)]/K)

−

≈

the player i adopts the strategy of player j. Otherwise,
the strategy of player i remains unchanged. Here K is
a noise parameter [12, 13, 14] that determines the like-
lihood that player i replaces his strategy when he meets
someone with a higher payoﬀ. For K
0, a player i is al-
most certain to replace (not to replace) his strategy when
he meets someone with a better (worse) payoﬀ. For large
K, a player has a probability of 1/2 to replace his strat-
egy, regardless of whether P (j) is better or worse than
P (i). In a fully connected network, a player’s character
may be replaced by any player in the system. In a square
lattice, a player’s character can only be replaced by one
of his four connected neighbors. As the game evolves, the
fractions of players with the three characters also evolve.
These fractions are referred to as frequencies. Depend-
ing on the parameters r and Q, the cooperator frequency
fC, defector frequency fD, and loner frequency fL take
on diﬀerent values in the long time limit.

A. Fully-connected network

Here, each player takes on one of three possible characters
or strategies: to cooperate (C), to defect (D), or to act
as a loner (L). The matrix element gives the payoﬀ to
a player using a strategy listed in the left hand column
when the opponent uses a strategy in the top row. In the
basic SG, it is useful to assign R = 1 so that the payoﬀs
can be characterized by a single parameter r = c′/2 =

A value of K = 0.1 is taken. The cooperator frequency
fC, defector frequency fD, and loner frequency fL are
obtained as a function of the cost-to-beneﬁt ratio r for

fD = r in a fully connected network. From Figure 1, the
loners extinct for a range of values of r < rL(Q) in which
the behavior is identical to the basic SG. For r > rL(Q),
the loners invade the whole population and both coop-
erators and defectors disappear. This is similar to the
results in the PDG [13] and in the PGG [11]. In a fully
connected network, the three characters cannot coexist.

FIG. 2: (Color online) Typical short-time behavior of the co-
operator, defector, and loner frequencies in a fully-connected
network for (a) the phase that C-players and D-players coex-
ist (Q = 0.5 and r = 0.7); and (b) the phase that loners take
out the whole system (Q = 0.5 and r = 0.8).

This is in sharp contrast to the rock-scissors-paper game
[24, 25, 26] on a fully connected network in which the
three strategies coexist. We obtained rL(Q) numerically.
The result is shown in Figure 1(d) as a curve in the r-
Q parameter space. It is found that rL(Q) follows the
functional form √1
Q, which will be explained later.
The curve rL(Q) represents a phase boundary that sep-
arates the r-Q space into two regions. The region below
(above) the curve corresponds to a phase in which coop-
erators and defectors (only loners) coexist (exist).

We also studied the temporal evolution in both phases,
i.e., for r < rL(Q) and r > rL(Q). Taking Q = 0.5, for
example, rL = 1/√2 = 0.707. Figure 2 shows fC (t),
fD(t) and fL(t) in the ﬁrst 103 MCS. The initial fre-
quencies are 1/3 for all three characters. For values of
r deep into either phase (see Fig. 2), the transient be-
havior dies oﬀ rapidly and the extinct character typically
102 MCS. In the phase where C and D

coexist, fC and fD oscillate slightly with time in the long
time limit, due to the dynamical nature of the game. It
is noted that for r
rL, the strategies compete for a
long while and the transient behavior lasts for a long
time. This slowing down behavior is typical of that near
a transition.

C-players have the same payoﬀ P (C) and all D-players
have the same payoﬀ P (D). These payoﬀs depend on fC,
fD, and fL at each time step. The payoﬀ for a loner is
N Q at all time, for a system with N
1. For small K,
fL decays exponentially with time if P (C) and P (D) are
both greater than N Q. In addition, the phase with only
non-vanishing fC and fD is achieved by having P (C) =
P (D). For this phase in the long time limit, P (C) =
N (fC + fD(1
r)) and P (D) = N fC(1 + r). Together
with fC + fD = 1 (since fL = 0 in the phase under
consideration), the condition P (C) = P (D) implies fC =
r and fD = r. These results are identical to the basic

SG (without loners) in a fully connected network. The
validity of this solution requires P (C) > N Q (and hence
P (D) > N Q), which is equivalent to r < √1
Q. This
is exactly the phase boundary shown in Figure 1(d).

B. Square Lattice

×

The behavior of the game in a square lattice is ex-
pected to be quite diﬀerent, due to the restriction that
a player can only compete with his connected neighbors.
100 square lattices
We carried out simulations on 100
with periodic boundary conditions. Figure 3(a)-(c) shows
fC(r), fD(r) and fL(r) for three diﬀerent values of the
loner payoﬀ Q. The results for the spatial SG (with-
out loners) on a square lattice [16] is also shown (solid
lines in Figure 3(a) and 3(b)) for comparison. A value
K = 0.1 is used. Several features should be noted. For
r < r(SL)
(Q), the loners eventually vanish with fC and
fD take on the mean values in the spatial SG without lon-
ers. This behavior is similar to that in fully connected
networks. For r > r(SL)
(Q), however, the behavior is
diﬀerent from that in fully connected networks. Here, C,
D, and L characters coexist. Above r(SL)
, fD drops with
r to a ﬁnite value, leaving rooms for fL to increase with
r. The cooperator frequency remains ﬁnite above r(SL)
.
Therefore, the cooperator frequency or the cooperative
level in the system as a whole is signiﬁcantly improved
by the presence of loners. For r > r(SL)
, increasing the
payoﬀ Q of loners leads to a higher cooperator frequency
and lower defector frequency. Reading out r(SL)
for dif-
ferent values of Q, we get the phase boundary as shown
in Figure 3(d) that separates a region characterized by
the coexistence of three characters and a region in which
only C and D coexist. The results indicate that, due to
the restriction imposed by the spatial geometry that a
player can only interact with his four nearest neighbors,
it takes a certain non-vanishing value of r for loners to
survive even in the limit of Q
1. The behavior is there-
fore diﬀerent from that in a fully connected network for
which the boundary is given by √1
Q. Note that there
exists a region of small values of r in which the steady
state consists of a uniform population of C strategy (see
Fig. 3(a) and Fig. 3(d)). For small Q, loners are eas-
ier to survive, when compared with the fully connected

case. Putting these results together, the phase diagram
(see Fig. 3(d)) for a square lattice, therefore, shows three
diﬀerent phases. The most striking eﬀect of the spatial
structure is that cooperators now exist in every phase.

Interestingly, we found that the phase boundary

as follows. We assume that the survival of loners is re-
lated to the cooperator frequency.
In particular, loner
survival requires the cooperator frequency to drop below

square lattice as in a fully connected network. That is
to say, we assume that loners could survive, for a given
value of Q and K, only when fC < f (Q) = 1
Q.
Numerical results also indicate that when all loners ex-
tinct, fC and fD follow the results in a spatial SG with-
out loners. This is shown as the solid line in Figure 3(a).
Therefore, for a given value of Q, we can simply read out
the value of r such that fC = f (Q) from the results in
spatial SG in a square lattice. For diﬀerent values of Q,
this procedure results in the dashed line shown in Figure
3(d) which describes the phase boundary quite well.

Figure 4 shows the temporal dependence of fC, fD,
and fL in a square lattice for two values of r at Q = 0.5.
For r = 0.55 (Fig. 4(a)), which corresponds to a case in
which only cooperators and defectors coexist, the number
of loners decay rapidly in time, typically within 100 MCS.
After the transient behavior, the cooperator and defec-
tor frequencies only oscillate slightly about their mean
values. This behavior is similar to that in the C and D
coexistence phase in Figure 1(d) for fully-connected net-
works. For r = 0.65 (Fig. 4(b)), which corresponds to
a case with the three characters coexist, the long time
behavior of fC, fD and fL is oscillatory. Similar be-
havior has been found in the rock-scissors-paper game
[24, 25, 26] and in the voluntary PDG [14]. Due to the

is also shown.

dynamical nature of character evolution, there are con-
tinuous replacements of one character by another and
this oscillatory behavior is expected.

The major diﬀerence between a square lattice and a
fully-connected network is that in a fully-connected net-
work, each player competes with all other players. As a
result, there are only three payoﬀs in the system – one
for each type of player, at each time step. The loners,
for example, have a constant payoﬀ of N Q, while the
cooperators and defectors have payoﬀs that depend on
fC(t) and fD(t). Once N Q is higher than the payoﬀs
of cooperators and defectors, the number of loners grows
until they take over the whole population. In a square
lattice, however, each player has a payoﬀ that depends
on his character and the detail of his neighborhood, i.e.,
the characters of his four connected neighbors. This im-
plies that the C-players and D-players in a square lattice
may have diﬀerent payoﬀs depending on the characters
of his connected neighbors. The loners have a constant
payoﬀ of 4Q. The non-uniform payoﬀs among C-players
and D-players in a lattice allow some C and D players
to coexist with the loners, by evolving to spatial local
conﬁgurations that favor their survivals.

Since the adaptive rule is related to the payoﬀ of each
character, it will be interesting to compare the payoﬀs in
a spatial SG without and with loners. Figure 5(a) shows
the mean payoﬀs of cooperators and defectors as a func-
tion of r in a spatial SG in a square lattice without loners.
The averaged payoﬀ over all players is also shown. For
small r, there is a phase with all C players and the payoﬀ
is 4 for each of the C players. For large r, there is a phase
with all D players and the payoﬀ is zero. For intermediate
r where C and D players coexist, the mean payoﬀ drops
gradually with r. In a spatial SG with loners (Fig. 5(b)),
it is observed that the mean payoﬀs basically follow that
in Figure 5(a) in the phase where loners are completely
replaced. When loners can survive, the presence of these
loners increases the payoﬀs of both the remaining cooper-
ators and defectors. The loners themselves have a payoﬀ
of 2 in a 2D square lattice. The cooperators’ payoﬀ is en-
hanced once loners survive and the increase follows the
same form as the increase in the loner frequency with
r (compare the circles in Fig. 5(b) with the squares in
Fig. 3(c) in the range of r when loners survive). When
loners survive, the payoﬀ averaged over all players is sig-
niﬁcantly enhanced due to their presence. This is similar
to what was found in the voluntary PDG [14].

C. Eﬀects of noise

→

All the results reported so far are for the case of
K = 0.1. This corresponds to a case where the player
is highly likely to replace his character when he meets a
better-performing player. In Figure 6, we show the ef-
fects of the noise parameter for a ﬁxed Q = 0.3. As K
increases, the step-like structure in fC as a function of
r becomes less obvious and fC is gradually suppressed
in the r
1 limit. The most important eﬀect of a 2D
square lattice is that each player is restricted to inter-
act with his four neighbors. Take a player of character
s(i), he will only encounter a ﬁnite number of conﬁgura-
tions for which he is competing in. For example, his four
neighbors may consist of 4 C-players; 3 C-players and 1
D-player or 1-loner, etc. Each of these conﬁgurations cor-
responds to a P (i). In a square lattice, therefore, there
will be a ﬁnite number of payoﬀs for a C-player, depend-
ing on the characters of the neighbors. Similarly, there
are ﬁnite number of payoﬀs for a D-player. The loners
always get a payoﬀ of 4Q. For K
0, the adaptive
mechanism is strictly governed by the ordering of these
payoﬀs. The distribution of players in a square lattice
will then evolve in time according to how the payoﬀs are
ordered. In the long time limit, only a few favorable lo-
cal conﬁgurations will survive and the number of players
in each of these favorable conﬁgurations is high. As one
increases r slightly, the ordering of the ﬁnite number of
payoﬀs may not change. Therefore, fC will not change
with r until we reach certain values of r that the order-
ing of the payoﬀs is changed. This gives rise to the more
sudden changes in fC as observed at some values of r

and it is the reason for having step-like features in fC
and fD for small values of K. As the noise parameter K
increases, the adaptive mechanism is less dependent on
the exact ordering of the payoﬀs. Therefore, the changes
in fC with r becomes more gradual as K increases. In-
terestingly, less obvious step-like structures in fC are also
observed in the spatial SG without loners in 2D lattices
with a larger coordination number [16]. This is also re-
lated to the picture we just described. A lattice with
more neighbors will give a higher number of neighbor-
hood conﬁgurations and hence more values of the payoﬀs.
More conﬁgurations also imply the number of players en-
countering a certain conﬁguration is smaller. Thus, the
number of players involved in a change in the ordering of
the payoﬀs as r changes is smaller. This has the eﬀect of
making the drop in fC gradual. Therefore, increasing K
for a given ﬁxed coordination number is similar in eﬀect
as increasing the coordination number for ﬁxed K.

IV. SUMMARY

We studied the eﬀects of the presence of loners in a
snowdrift game with loners in fully-connected networks

and in square lattices. In a fully-connected network, ei-
ther cooperators live with defectors or loners take over
the whole population. The condition for loners to take
r2. This result can be un-
over is found to be Q > 1
−
derstood by following the payoﬀs of each strategy. In a
fully-connected network, the strategies’ payoﬀs are par-
ticularly simple in that they depend only on the strategy
frequencies at the time under consideration, with each
type of player having the same payoﬀ.

In a square lattice, the spatial SG with loners behave
quite diﬀerently. It is found that the cooperators can sur-
vive in the fully parameter space covering 0 < r < 1 and
0 < Q < 1. Depending on the values of these parame-
ters, there are three possible phases: a uniform C-player
population, C-players and D-players coexist, and coex-
istence of the three characters. The underlying lattice
thus makes the survival of cooperators easier. The pres-
ence of loners is also found to promote the presence of
cooperators. There average payoﬀ among all players is
also found to be enhanced in the presence of loners. We
discussed the inﬂuence of a square lattice in terms of the
payoﬀs of the players. In a square lattice, spatial restric-
tion is imposed on the players in that a player can only
interact with the four nearest neighbors. This leads to
a payoﬀ that does not only depend on the character but
also depend on the local environment in which the player
is competing in. The players in the local environment, in
turns, are also competing in their own local environment.
This will lead to clustering or aggregation of players in
the square lattice into conﬁgurations that the payoﬀs fa-

7

vored. The dependence of the frequencies on r in a square
lattice then reﬂects the change in preferred conﬁgurations
as r is changed.

We also studied the eﬀects of the noise parameter in
the adaptive mechanism.
It is found that as the noise
parameter increases, the change of the frequencies with
r becomes more gradual. This is related to the impor-
tance of the ordering of the many payoﬀs in the adaptive
mechanism. As the noise parameter increases, the exact
ordering of the payoﬀs becomes less important and the
change in frequencies becomes more gradual.

In closing, we note that it will be interesting to further
investigate the eﬀects of loners in the snowdrift game in
networks of other structures. Among them are the re-
wiring of regular lattices into a small-world network or a
random network and the scale-free networks [27].

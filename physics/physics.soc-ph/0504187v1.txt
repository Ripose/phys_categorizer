Abstract

Surrogate Data Analysis (SDA) is a statistical hypothesis testing framework for

the determination of weak chaos in time series dynamics. Existing SDA procedures

do not account properly for the rich structures observed in stock return sequences,

attributed to the presence of heteroscedasticity, seasonal eﬀects and outliers. In

this paper we suggest a modiﬁcation of the SDA framework, based on the robust

estimation of location and scale parameters of mean-stationary time series and a

probabilistic framework which deals with outliers. A demonstration on the NAS-

DAQ Composite index daily returns shows that the proposed approach produces

surrogates that faithfully reproduce the structure of the original series while being

manifestations of linear-random dynamics.

Key words: Surrogate Data Analysis, Least Median of Squares, heteroscedasticity,

Chaos, Financial Time Series Analysis.

1 Introduction

The search for nonlinear deterministic dynamics in stock market prices has

been an intensive area 1 for research, and especially active in the recent years

with the advances in Econophysics (9; 10). The accurate determination of

stock return dynamics and their distributional properties is of main concern

here, as they can signiﬁcantly improve portfolio formation and risk evaluation

practices, as well as allow the ﬁne tuning of asset valuation procedures.

There have been several indications that stock prices do not ﬂuctuate as ran-

domly as they should, according to the underlying theoretical equilibrium

framework (see discussions in Ref. 11; 12; 13; 14), and exhibit rich and com-

plex structures (15; 16; 17). However, earlier research (18; 19; 20; 21; 22; 23)

has not provided a clear answer towards the presence or absence of nonlin-

ear determinism and chaos. Hence, the candidacy of deterministic chaos as

an alternative hypothesis to randomness, has not enjoyed popularity among

the ranks of economists. Limitations posed by the quantity and quality of

data, computational power and the absence of a widely acceptable and ap-

propriate theoretical and statistical framework, have also been factors that

contributed to the dispute against chaotic dynamics in ﬁnance and economics

(18; 19; 20; 24; 25; 26; 27; 28; 29). However, a Monte-Carlo simulation-based

statistical hypothesis testing framework for detecting weak chaos, appears to

have been ignored by and large till recently in ﬁnance (30; 31; 32; 33; 34). This

framework is called Surrogate Data Analysis (SDA: 35; 36) and has preceded

historically a signiﬁcant amount of inﬂuential research of chaotic dynamics in

ﬁnance and economics.

SDA (see section 3 for details on how this methodology works) has been pri-

marily designed to ensure the validity of results of investigations for nonlinear

determinism and the presence of weak chaos. Similar investigations have been

mainly focusing on the examination of invariant measures, such as dimension

based statistics for the characterization of strange attractors (37). However

such measures have been shown to provide misleading, biased or inconclusive

results, due to the presence of noise or the lack of suﬃcient observations in

the data sets examined (24; 25; 26; 27; 28). Though SDA can provide the

means to bypass some of the limitations posed by the quality and quantity

of the sequences under examination, still the structure of their underlying

dynamics and their noise content can pose serious considerations. The above

discussion comes into context in the analysis of ﬁnancial time series, where

the nature of the data generating processes and the noise components are

still largely unknown, while the “mechanics” and the equilibrium conditions

of the market systems examined often appear empirically to be ill or loosely

deﬁned. Especially, the presence of heteroscedastic noise in stock returns and

their nonstationary ﬂuctuations among other stylized facts (38), can mask the

presence of low dimensional nonlinear determinism. As mentioned earlier, the

greatest disadvantage of the nonlinear statistics based on invariant measures

is their lack of power, especially in ﬁnancial applications. SDA enables us to

3

bypass this limitation. However, heteroscedasticity may render this exercise

useless, as the existing surrogate methods are designed for homoscedastic time

series. Their application on noisy and heteroscedastic sequences may lead to

misleading results and biased or inaccurate conclusions (39; 40; 41). Since

SDA is essentially a simulation of the linear characteristics of a time series,

it should be able to deal with heteroscedasticity, outliers and calendar eﬀects,

which are major features of ﬁnancial time series. In this paper we demonstrate

how to modify one of the most advanced and popular surrogate methods, the

Iterative Amplitude Adjusted Fourier Transformed surrogates (IAAFT) (42),

in order to account for important stylized facts regarding heteroscedasticity,

calendar eﬀects and outliers in stock returns sequences.

2 Dealing with heteroscedasticity and outliers

A time series sequence is subject to heteroscedasticity when the variance is

time-varying. Empirical research on stock returns has shown that from time

to time the variance ﬂuctuates, volatility appears to be clustering, while out-

liers appear in the time series, often attributed to exogenous factors and ran-

dom events. The use of robust statistics is justiﬁed for the identiﬁcation and

characterization of the underlying dynamics. Robust statistics were developed

principally during the 70’s with a few related but major methodologies ap-

pearing the following decade. In this paper we make use of the Least Median

of Squares (LMS) concept introduced by (43; 44). The LMS estimator min-

imizes the median of the squared discrepancies rather than the mean, as in

the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) methodology. Hence, LMS estimators may

produce results which are relatively immune to the presence of the outliers

4

and the non-normality of the errors’ distribution. One disadvantage of LMS

estimators is that they are considerably less eﬃcient in the case of normally

distributed errors. However, it is well established that the distributions of

the ﬁrst logarithmic diﬀerences of stock prices (i.e., logarithmic returns) fail

normality tests, and exhibit strong leptokurtic features, and this justiﬁes the

applicability of the LMS concept.

Since outliers may pose considerations under the SDA framework, it is nec-

essary to follow a policy for their classiﬁcation and characterization. For the

purposes of our approach here, in order to isolate the outliers of a given data

set x, we suggest the following steps in the spirit of the wider LMS literature:

(1) Find the LMS location parameter of the data set:

loc = argmin(med(x − θ)2),

(1)

i.e., determine the value of a parameter θ which minimizes the median

of the squared deviations from the median. This can be easily achieved

by sorting the data set and calculating the midpoint of the range of the

50% of the densest data.

(2) Find the LMS scale parameter of the data set:

scale = 1.4826 × (1 +

5
N − 1

) × med(r2),

(2)

where r is the residuals’ vector obtained from the previous step and the

consistency constant 1.4826 comes from the square root of the median of

the chi-square distribution with one degree of freedom (43). Hence, this

scale parameter can be calculated once the LMS location parameter θ is

5

(3) Calculate the zLMS-score: zLMS = (x − loc)/scale i.e., normalize the data

estimated.

according to the LMS concept.

Rousseeuw and Leroy (44) propose the following fuzzy model (see also Fig. 1)

for determining the degree λ of a residual not being an outlier:

• If |zLMS| ≤ 2.0 then λ = 1.0 and x is not an outlier,

• if 2.0 < |zLMS| ≤ 3.0 then λ = 3.0 − |zLMS|, and x is not an outlier with

degree λ, and

• if 3.0 < |zLMS| then λ = 0.0, and x is an outlier.

[ Insert Fig. 1 about here. ]

Our approach converts the above fuzzy model to probabilistic. In other words,

every time we run the surrogate data algorithm we consider a probability equal

to the degree λ that a data point x is classiﬁed or not as an outlier. Thus, we

classify as “outliers” values with a corresponding |zLMS| score more than 3.0,

and as non-outliers the values with a corresponding |zLMS| score less than 2.0. A

random number generator that produces uniformly distributed random values

in [0,1] helps on the intermediate |zLMS| scores (i.e., scores between 2 and 3).

For example if a data point x has |zLMS| score of 2.8, a corresponding random

number of 0.2 or greater will classify it as an outlier, while a corresponding

random number less than 0.2 will not classify it as one.

3 The methodology of the Probabilistic IAAFT surrogates

The SDA methodology focuses on producing simulated sets from a sequence

which capture only the linear properties of the original data. Then a discrim-

inating pivotal statistic is chosen. Suﬃcient evidence for rejecting the null of

linear stochastic dynamics is given when the value of the statistic calculated

on the original data, diﬀers signiﬁcantly from its values obtained from the

surrogate sets. The simulation procedures for generating surrogate data dif-

fer according to the null being considered. For example, a simple reshuﬄing

of the original sequence can test for white noise, whereas more complicated

reshuﬄing exercises may test for linearly ﬁltered noise or monotonic nonlinear

transformations of linearly ﬁltered noise. Usually the last case is regarded as

the most interesting, as the other procedures may produce spurious results in

the presence of linearly correlated noise that has been transformed by a static,

monotone nonlinearity. The SDA technique is diﬀerent to the Bootstrap (45)

as is refers to a constrained randomization simulation based hypothesis testing

framework, found in permutation tests (46).

To test for the original sequence being a monotonic nonlinear transformation of

linearly ﬁltered noise, one has to simulate surrogates according to the following

steps (47; 48):

(1) Starting with the original sequence x, generate an individually and iden-

tically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian data set y and reorder according to

the ranking of xn. In this way we can rescale the original sequence to a

normal distribution.

(2) Produce the Fourier transform of the rescaled sequence y and assign a

7

random phase to each (positive) frequency.

(3) Take the inverse transform of above step’s sequence, say y∗. This stage

ensures that the surrogates will exhibit the same power spectrum as the

originating sequence x.

(4) Reorder the original data x to generate a surrogate xs which will have the

same rank distribution as y∗. In this way we are certain that not only the

spectrum but also the distribution of the original sequence x is preserved

in xs.

The above surrogates are referred to as “Amplitude Adjusted Fourier Trans-

formed ” surrogates or AAFT for sort. AAFT surrogates will have the same

distributions and amplitudes with the original sequence but will not exhibit

the same power spectra. To achieve the latter, an improved, iterative version

of AAFT surrogates (termed IAAFT) has been proposed. To produce IAAFT

surrogates (42; 49) one has to follow the steps below:

(1) Apply a Fourier transform to the original sequence x and save the am-

plitudes α. Produce a shuﬄed surrogate sequence x′

s from the original

x, apply a Fourier transform to x′

s and preserve the phases φ. Finally,

construct a vector ~r that contains the ranking of x.

(2) Produce a phase randomized (AAFT) surrogate sequence x′′

s combining

α and φ. Compare the rank orders of x′′

s and ~r. If these are the same,

proceed to the next step, otherwise the vector ~r hosts the rankings of x′′
s ,

φ hosts the phases of x′′

s , and the procedure of this step is repeated. This

step can also be terminated if the maximum number of iterations deﬁned

by the user (e.g., 1000) is reached. Thus we avoid strong discrepancies

between the surrogates and the original sequence’s spectrum.

(3) Force x′′

s to follow the distribution of x, by assigning on its indices the

8

corresponding values of x.

The IAAFT surrogates ensure that the main linear features of a time series

will be faithfully preserved. However, the above procedure has been designed

for stationary time series and therefore cannot cope with the presence of het-

eroscedasticity and outliers. In other words and with respect to the classiﬁ-

cation produced in section 2, the IAAFT surrogates have been designed for

time series where all the observations are subject to |zLMS| ≤ 2. According to

the proposed framework in this paper and in order to take into account the

outliers that are observed in stock returns, we have to modify the surrogate

generating algorithm according to the following steps:

(1) Calculate the LMS location parameter of the time series.

(2) Calculate the LMS scale parameter of the time series.

(3) Calculate the zLMS for each observation.

(4) Convert the zLMS to λ, according to section 2.

(5) Create a new series of uniformly distributed random numbers in [0,1], say

u, with length equal to the length of the original time series.

(6) Create a new time series xs, which contains all the values of x that cor-

respond to λi ≥ ui.

(7) Apply the IAAFT surrogate algorithm to xs.

(8) The ﬁnal surrogate sequence will preserve the values of x that correspond

to λi < ui, in exactly the same positions as in the original sequence, and

will receive the surrogate of xs for λi ≥ ui, to ﬁll the remaining gaps.

Our experiments below show that according to the above procedure (termed

Probabilistic IAAFT, or PIAAFT for short), the outliers, volatility clustering

and hence heteroscedasticity can be faithfully reproduced with a “reason-

9

able” probability, according to their level of presence in the original sequence.

Moreover, the rest of the desirable properties of the IAAFT surrogates are

preserved.

4 Calendar Correction

So far we have described a surrogates generation procedure which is able

to account for heteroscedasticity. In this section we also demonstrate how to

account for the calendar eﬀects. As a ﬁrst step we have to deﬁne what we imply

here by the term “calendar eﬀects”. Since there is no universal deﬁnition, we

presume eight kinds of calendar eﬀects. The ﬁrst ﬁve eﬀects, and the least

important ones, are the ﬁve weekdays. Next and of greater importance, the

ﬁrst and last trading days of a month (day-of-month) are being considered as

calendar eﬀects. Finally, we have the holiday eﬀect, which is also assumed here

to be the most important. For example, if a trading day can be characterized as

both a pre-holiday and end-of-month day, the holiday eﬀect applies. Following

the same rationale, if a trading day is both a Thursday and the ﬁrst day of a

trading month, it is classiﬁed according to the latter eﬀect.

In order to specialize the algorithm given in section 3, we have to reconsider

its ﬁrst 3 steps for the “calendar-wise” time series. To achieve it, we normalize

(using the LMS parameters) every calendar-wise distribution. The rest of the

steps are followed without any change, save for the 7th step which has to be

adapted according to the calendar structure of the time series. This procedure

is the Calendar Corrected version of the PIAAFT (hence CCPIAAFT).

5 Empirical Results

This section compares the surrogates produced by the proposed CCPIAFFT

algorithm to the surrogates of the IAAFT algorithm. Our time series is the

NASDAQ Composite Index, daily closings, from 5-Feb-1971 to 31-Dec-2003.

There are totally 8311 observations. Since all the surrogates generating algo-

rithms need the original time series to be at least mean stationary, we work

with the ﬁrst logarithmic diﬀerences of the daily closing prices (i.e., the con-

tinuously compounded returns).

[ Insert Fig. 2 about here. ]

[ Insert Fig. 3 about here. ]

As the Fig. 2 and 3 show, there is no need for speciﬁc statistical tests to realize

the diﬀerence between the compared surrogate algorithms. The CCPIAAFT

surrogates “imitate” extremely well the heteroscedasticity caused by volatility

clustering in the original time series and the trend changes that are implied.

In Fig. 4 and 5 we utilize the correlation integral (37, CI:) to demonstrate

that the CCPIAAFT surrogates result a CI much more closer to the one of

the original time series.

[ Insert Fig. 4 about here. ]

[ Insert Fig. 5 about here. ]

Considering the IAAFT surrogates as our null hypothesis implies that we the-

orize that extreme events (such as the oil crisis of 1973, the Black Monday of

11

1987 and the recent bubble of 2000) can occur with equal probability, a premise

that voluminous research in ﬁnance has challenged so far. Certain events that

trigger unanticipated changes, occur due to exogenous political and economic

(and not necessarily) market dynamics. Therefore, if these unsystematic ﬂuc-

tuations could be preserved, along with any other calendar eﬀects, one could

produce ﬁnancial surrogates that faithfully reproduce certain market reali-

ties. The linear correlations and the randomization of the returns should only

aﬀect the systematic components. Hence, CCPIAAFT surrogates essentially

isolate the systematic from the unsystematic changes. The degree to which

this is achieved is highlighted in Fig. 2 and 3. Fig. 6 and 7 also refer to various

realizations of CCPIAAFT surrogates for comparison purposes.

[ Insert Fig. 6 about here. ]

[ Insert Fig. 7 about here. ]

6 Conclusions

In this paper we suggest a method which embodies the outliers and calen-

dar eﬀects on the production of surrogate data. In ﬁnancial time series where

heteroscedasticity, in the sense of volatility clustering, is the most striking fea-

ture, the proposed method yields simulated sequences which are more similar

to the original time series, when compared with other surrogate data generat-

ing methods. Moreover, the proposed approach has the advantage of behaving

as the IAAFT algorithm when no heteroscedasticity or calendar eﬀects are

present. We do not assume (G)ARCH volatility structures, however our strat-

12

egy can be modiﬁed to accommodate such a case. We reserve this as an area

for future research.

Fig. 1. The model proposed by Rousseeuw and Leroy (1987) (44) regarding the distinction between outliers and the bulk of the ob-
servations, according to the |zLMS| score. In this model λ on the vertical scale represents the degree of a point not being an outlier.
Observations with |zLMS| < 1 are not considered outliers, and observations with |zLMS| > 3 are surely considered outliers. In between
these two extremes, the degree falls linearly.

surrogates, the AAFT surrogates, the IAAFT surrogates and the CCPIAAFT surrogates. It is evident that the CCPIAAFT series preserve
the salient features of the original sequence, especially the volatility clustering and the outliers (shocks) which are linked to well known
historical events such as the crash of 1987 and the uncertainty after the burst of the more recent ﬁnancial bubble.

characteristics.

Fig. 5. The logarithm of the norm-2 diﬀerence between the correlation integral of the original time series and the surrogates, shown in
Fig. (2). We observe that in both cases the CCPIAAFT surrogates show the smallest diﬀerence compared to their counterparts, implying
that the CCPIAAFT surrogates provide improved simulations of the original time series.

Fig. 6. A comparison of the original time series and 4 CCPIAAFT surrogate series. Which one is the original? (Answer: the 4th from
above).

Fig. 7. The levels of the series shown in Fig. (6). In this graph the diﬀerentiation from the original time series is obvious in very few
speciﬁc time domains. More precisely, we can observe that the drop of the index related to the 1974 crisis and the increase related to the
2000 bubble, appear to be smoother in all surrogate series. This is attributed to the small daily changes in each case being considered as
part of the normal ﬂuctuations of the original time series by the CCPIAAFT procedure.

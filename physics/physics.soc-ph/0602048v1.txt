Delta Hedged Option Valuation with Underlying Non-Gaussian Returns

The standard Black-Scholes theory of option pricing is extended to cope with underlying return
ﬂuctuations described by general probability distributions. A Langevin process and its related
Fokker-Planck equation are devised to model the market stochastic dynamics, allowing us to write
and formally solve the generalized Black-Scholes equation implied by dynamical hedging. A sys-
tematic expansion around a non-perturbative starting point is then implemented, recovering the
Matacz’s conjectured option pricing expression. We perform an application of our formalism to the
real stock market and ﬁnd clear evidence that while past ﬁnancial time series can be used to evaluate
option prices before the expiry date with reasonable accuracy, the stochastic character of volatility
is an essential ingredient that should necessarily be taken into account in analytical option price
modeling.

There has been a great interest in the study of the
stochastic dynamics of ﬁnancial markets through ideas
and techniques borrowed from the statistical physics con-
text. A set of well-established phenomenological results,
universally valid across global markets, yields the moti-
vating ground for the search of relevant models [1, 2, 3].
A ﬂurry of activity, in particular, has been related to
the problem of option price valuation. Options are con-
tracts which assure to its owner the right to negotiate
(i.e, to sell or to buy) for an agreed value, an arbitrary
ﬁnancial asset (stocks of some company, for instance) at
a future date. The writer of the option contract, on the
other hand, is assumed to comply with the option owner’s
decision on the expiry date. Options are a crucial ele-
ment in the modern markets, since they can be used, as
convincingly shown by Black and Scholes [4], to reduce
portfolio risk.

The Black-Scholes theory of option pricing is a closed
analytical formulation where risk vanishes via the proce-
dure of dynamical (also called “delta”) hedging, applied
to what one might call “log-normal eﬃcient markets”.
Real markets, however, exhibit strong deviations of log-
normality in the statistical ﬂuctuations of stock index
returns, and are only approximately eﬃcient.

Our aim in this letter is to introduce a theoretical
framework for option pricing which is general enough
to account for important features of real markets. We
also perform empirical tests, taking the London market
as the arena where theory and facts can be compared.
More concretely, we report in this work observational re-
sults concerning options of european style, based on the
FTSE 100 index, denoted from now on as St [5].

To start with, we note, in fact, that the returns of the
FTSE 100 index do not follow log-normal statistics for
small time horizons. We have considered a ﬁnancial time
series of 242993 minutes (roughly, two years) ending on
17th november, 2005. The probability distribution func-
tion (pdf) ρ(ω) of the returns given by ω ≡ ln(St/St−1),

taken at one minute intervals is shown in Fig.1. We ver-
ify that the Student t-distribution with three degrees of
freedom conjectured by Borland [6] provides a good ﬁt
to the data. A slightly better ﬁtting is produced if a
smooth gaussian envelope is introduced to truncate the
distribution at the far tails, viz:

ρ(ω) ∝

(a2 + ω2)2 exp(−

ω2

A time-dependent family of self-similar Tsallis distri-
butions [7], ρ(ω, t) ∝ (a2(t) + ω2)1/(1−q), with variance

a2(t) ∝ t2/(3−q), was previously considered in option
price modeling [6]. The time parameter t refers here to
the time horizon of return ﬂuctuations, while q ≃ 1.5
is indicated from empirical pdfs. Even though sugges-
tive results were found by Borland for a set of option
prices taken from the real market, the time dependence of
the variance a2(t) disagrees with observations. It is well-
established that the variance of return ﬂuctuations grows
linearly with the time horizon within a certain range of
days, and that the return pdfs are not self-similar (there
is a crossover to the log-normal proﬁle). A further diﬃ-
culty has to do with the matching between the theoreti-
cal and observed volatilities. As reported in Ref. [6], for
instance, the model volatility needed to reproduce the
volatility smiles of options based on the S&P500 futures
in june 2001 is set to 32.95%. However, as the analy-
sis of the S&P500 futures time series reveals, the actual
volatility for that period was considerably smaller, close
to 14.5% [8].

The essential reason for the speciﬁc choice of a(t) in
the above pdf is that it is related to a formerly known
Langevin equation, which leads, on its turn, to a partial
diﬀerential equation for option prices. An alternative
and more general point of view – to be pursued here –
is not to advance, a priori, any hypothesis on the form
of the return pdfs, while still dealing with a Langevin
description of return ﬂuctuations.

Le us assume, therefore, that at time t = 0 the under-
lying index is S0 and that its subsequent values are given
by

St = S0 exp[µt + x(t)] ,

(2)

where x(t) is a dynamic random variable described, at
time t, by an arbitrary pdf ρ(x, t). We take x = 0 at
t = 0. Observe that it is a simple exercise to write, from
Eq. (2), the formal expression for the pdf of returns with
time horizon t, in a statistically stationary regime.

As an inverse problem, we are now interested to ﬁnd a
function f = f (x, t), so that ρ(x, t) be derived from the
Langevin equation

dx
dt

= f (x, t)η(t) ,

(3)

where η(t) is a random gaussian ﬁeld, deﬁned by hη(t)i =
0 and hη(t)η(t′)i = δ(t − t′). Actually, it is not diﬃcult
to compute f (x, t) as a functional of ρ(x, t). We just
write down the Fokker-Planck equation that is satisﬁed
by ρ(x, t) [9],

2

The function f (x, t) is an important element in the op-
tion pricing problem, within the dynamical hedging strat-
egy of investment. Considering the writer of an op-
tion contract who owns a number ∆ of the underlying
asset, dynamical hedging, a concept ﬁrstly introduced
by Black and Scholes, consists of deﬁning option prices
V = V (S, t) as a function of the asset’s value S and
time t, so that ∆ = ∂V /∂S, and the “minimal” portfolio
Π(S, t) ≡ S∆(S, t) − V (S, t) is imposed to evolve accord-
ing to the market risk-free interest rate r, as if Π(S, t)
were converted to cash and safely deposited into an in-
terest earning bank account. Under these conditions, a
straightfoward application of Ito’s lemma leads to the
generalized Black-Scholes equation,

Exact solutions of this equation may be given in terms
of statistical averages. For the case of call options which
expire at time t∗, we get

where ζ =

the option’s time to expire. One may check, by direct
substitution, that (7) solves, in fact, Eq. (6). The put-
call parity relation is also satisﬁed by our solution, as any
bona ﬁde option pricing formula should do. It is worth
noting that the case where f (x, t) is constant corresponds
to the standard Black-Scholes problem.

In order to develop analytical expressions for V (S, t),
let Z(λ) = hexp(iλζ)i be the characteristic function asso-
ciated to the distribution φ(ζ, T ). We may write, without

is clear that Za and Zb can be computed, in principle,
with the help of the cumulant expansion. However, a
non-perturbative analysis may be readily addressed when
one realizes that Za(λ, 0) is nothing but the characteris-
tic funtion of ρ(x, T ). The remaining problem, then, is to
evaluate the corrections due to Za(0, λ) and Zb(λ) (they
are in fact small in realistic cases). Up to ﬁrst order in
λ, we have Zb(λ) = 1 and Za(0, λ) = 1 − i λ

the cases where the far tails of ρ(x, t) decay faster than

partitioned into 94 pieces of 2585 minutes each (roughly
one ﬁnancial week).
In each one of these pieces, the
market drift parameter µ was determined by the least
squares method. Then, according to Eq. (2), we deﬁne
δxi ≡ xi+1 − xi = ln(Si+1/Si) − µ. We have found that
improved results are obtained if extremely intense ﬂuctu-
ations are removed from the series, since they are likely
to correspond to the market’s reaction to unexpected
events (we have checked this assumption in a number
of cases). Once the standard deviation for the whole se-
ries is σ0 = 2.6 × 10−4, we removed from the series the
ﬂuctuations given by |δxi| > 3 × 10−3 ∼ 10σ0 (only 144
elements were taken out from the δxi series). A sequence
of 3000 samples, separated in time by one hour transla-
tions, was used in each option price evaluation. It turns
out that the samples are related to a period of reasonably
well-behaved volatility (it ﬂuctuates around some stable
value). We also introduce a phenomenological factor g,
so that trials with series of diﬀerent mean volatilities are
obtained in a simple way from the mapping δxi → gδxi.
We have computed in this way option premiums based
on the London FTSE 100 index (with ǫ = 1 minute). The
results are shown in Tables I and II, where market (MKT)
and evaluated prices (EP) are compared. In the tables,
NA stands for “not available” data, while X stands for
prices we did not evaluate; the values between brackets
correspond to instances where the time series extension
was not large enough to get accurate predictions. The
daily closing values of the FTSE 100 index, S, the g-
factors, and the model and observed mean volatilities (σ∗
and σ, respectively) are reported in the table captions.
The numerical errors in the EP columns vary typically
from 0.5% for the larger premiums to 10% for the smaller
ones. When comparing the market and numerical results,
one should keep in mind the existence of the usual bid-ask
spread of option prices.

As clearly shown in Fig. 2, we have been able to model

4

volatility smiles which are in good agreement with the
market ones. The remarkable feature of these results is
that implied volatilities can be obtained from a single
model volatility, σ∗, which is in fact close to the actual
observed market volatility σ.

We have, along similar lines, evaluated option prices
through Monte Carlo simulations. The stochastic process
{δxi} is now generated as independent events from the
Student t-distribution with three-degrees of freedom. As
shown in Table III, the Black-Scholes (BS) and Student t-
distribution-based evaluations (ST) yield relatively close
(and not good) answers for option prices. It is impor-
tant to note the numerical results do not diﬀer too much
if Matacz’s analytical option price formula is used with
convolutions of the truncated Student t-distribution, Eq.
(1), once the log-normal return pdf cores get large enough
for time horizons of a few days.

To summarize, we have provided strong evidence, from
the empirical analysis of non-gaussian market data, that
the combination of delta-hedging strategy and suitable
Langevin modeling allows one to compute option premi-
ums with reasonable conﬁdence, from the use of Eqs. (7)
and (10). On the other hand, we have found that both
the Monte Carlo simulations and the delta-hedging an-
alytical framework based on fat-tailed distributions and
time-independent volatilities which are close to the ob-
served averaged values, fail to predict real market option
prices. Our results point out that eﬃcient option pricing
analytical tools have necessarily to deal with the stochas-
tic nature of volatility ﬂuctuations, a main distinctive
aspect of ﬁnancial time series.

Abstract

Capacity estimation is an important tool for the design and dimensioning of pedestrian
facilities. The literature contains diﬀerent procedures and speciﬁcations which show con-
siderable diﬀerences with respect to the estimated ﬂow values. Moreover do new ex-
perimental data indicate a stepwise growing of the capacity with the width and thus
challenge the validity of the speciﬁc ﬂow concept. To resolve these diﬀerences we have
studied experimentally the unidirectional pedestrian ﬂow through bottlenecks under lab-
oratory conditions. The time development of quantities like individual velocities, density
and individual time gaps in bottlenecks of diﬀerent width is presented. The data show a
linear growth of the ﬂow with the width. The comparison of the results with experimental
data of other authors indicates that the basic assumption of the capacity estimation for
bottlenecks has to be revised. In contradiction with most planning guidelines our main
result is, that a jam occurs even if the incoming ﬂow does not overstep the capacity de-
ﬁned by the maximum of the ﬂow according to the fundamental diagram.

Introduction

Today more than half of the mankind is living in cities, while 50 years ago this were only
30 percent1. The growth of cities worldwide is inexorable and a great challenge for the
urban development and architecture. In this context knowledge about pedestrian dynamics
is important and allows e.g. the design and optimization of facilities with respect to safety,
level of service and economy. A basic practical application is the capacity estimation which
allows the dimensioning or evaluation of facilities [1–5]. For this purpose one is interested in
the number of pedestrians, ∆N , which is able to pass the facility in a certain time interval,
∆t. The specifying quantity is the ﬂow:

The capacity is deﬁned as the maximal value for the ﬂow, C = Jmax, and allows e.g. the
estimation of the minimal time needed for emptying of a given facility or of the minimal
width of the facility which allows the emptying in a given time. In the case of a classical
bottleneck, like a narrowing in a corridor, it is generally assumed that a jam will occur when
the incoming ﬂow exceeds the capacity of the bottleneck [1, 4, 6, 7]. At ﬁrst glance this seems
to be a reasonable assumption which can be justiﬁed by reference to the continuity equation.
This equation trivially implies the increase of the density in a control volume if the incoming
ﬂow is larger than the outgoing ﬂow. However, this establishes Jmax only as an upper limit
for the incoming ﬂow which produces a jam and does not exclude its formation for smaller
ﬂow values already.
In the literature one can ﬁnd diﬀerent speciﬁcations to estimate the capacity of a pedestrian
facility. The ﬂow equation in combination with empirical measurements is commonly used,
see for example [1–4, 6, 8–11]. With the width of the pedestrian facility, b, the ﬂow equation
can be written

J = ρ v

b .

(2)

|{z}=Js
The speciﬁc ﬂow, Js, gives the ﬂow per unit-width and can be calculated as the product of the
average density, ρ, and the average speed, v, of a pedestrian stream. The velocity and thus the
ﬂow is a function of the density. The empirical relation between ﬂow and density, J = J(ρ),
is called the fundamental diagram for which one can ﬁnd diﬀerent representations. With a
given fundamental diagram in the representation J(ρ) the capacity of a facility is deﬁned as
the maximum of this function. In general it is assumed that for a given facility (e.g. corridors,
stairs, doors) Equation 2 is valid, which implies that the fundamental diagrams for diﬀerent
b merge into one universal diagram for the speciﬁc ﬂow Js. Consequently the capacity, C,
is assumed to be a linear function of the width, b. This assumption is used for all kinds
of facilities and pedestrian streams (uni- or bidirectional). In this article we concentrate on
unidirectional pedestrian movement through bottlenecks under normal conditions. If in the
following the term movement under normal conditions is used it is meant, that panic or in
particular non adaptive behavior which can occur in critical situation or under circumstances
including rewards [12] are excluded.
Figure 1 shows various fundamental diagrams used in handbooks and planing guidelines for
the capacity estimations of openings, doors or bottlenecks. The fundamental diagrams diﬀer
with respect to both, the height of the maximum (i.e. the capacity) and the corresponding
density value. According to the handbook of the Society of Fire Protection Engineers (SFPE)
and the guideline of Weidmann the maximum is located at a density around ρ = 1.8 m−2,
while the maximum considered from Predtechenskii and Milinskii2 (PM) is located at densities
larger than ρ = 7 m−2. The predicted capacities diﬀer from C = 1.2 (ms)−1 to 1.6 (ms)−1.
But as mentioned above all this procedures assume a linear dependence between capacity and
bottleneck-width.
Contrary to this, Hoogendoorn and Daamen [13, 14] claim that the capacity is growing in a
step-wise manner. This statement is based on their observation that inside a bottleneck the

2We note, that the data for PM are gained from Equation 7,8 and 9 in chapter III in [1] and not from the
tabular in the appendix of the book. For the scaling of the density we chose A = 0.113 m2 which gives the area
of horizontal projection of a pedestrian in mid-season street dress and the fundamental diagram for movement
under normal conditions.

formation of lanes occurs, resulting from the zipper eﬀect during entering the bottleneck. The
zipper eﬀect is a self organization phenomenon leading to an optimization of the available
space and velocity inside the bottleneck. The data in [13, 14] indicate that the distance
between these lanes is independent of the bottleneck-width. This would imply that the
capacity increases only when an additional lane can develop, i.e. that this would occur in
a stepwise manner with increasing width [14]. Consequently, either the speciﬁc ﬂow would
decreases between the values where the steps occur or the ﬂow equation in combination with
the concept of a speciﬁc ﬂow would not hold. One goal of this work is to examine this claim
(and especially Section 4 is devoted to this question).

Table 1: Comparison of estimated and measured capacities for bottlenecks. The results
reveal the diﬀerences not only between measurements and estimations, but also among the
estimation methods or speciﬁcations.

In Table 1 these uncertainties in the capacity estimations are compared with selected ex-

3

perimental data on pedestrian ﬂow. The table includes the methods according the SFPE
Handbook [6], the guideline of Predtechenskii and Milinskii (PM) [1], the guideline of Wei-
dmann (WM) [4], the speciﬁcation of Hoogendoorn (HG) in [14] and the experimental mea-
surements by Kretz [15], Nagai [16] and M¨uller [17]. For a better comparability we neglected
the eﬀective width concept used in [4, 6] as well as in [14]. To consider the eﬀective width
would lead to smaller ﬂows and larger diﬀerences to the experimental measurements. Table 1
reveals the diﬀerences among the results of estimation procedures, which can exceed a factor
of two. Given that these estimations come without error margins there is, strictly speaking,
no contradiction. However in the context of evacuation-time predictions a discrepancy of 100
percent is unacceptable. The experimental measurements of the capacity of bottlenecks show
also non negligible variations. The variation between experimental data and estimation pro-
cedures can exceed a factor of four, see Table 1. For the diﬀerences among the experimental
measurements there are multiple possible reasons. However one has to note that all measure-
ments were performed under well controlled laboratory conditions and that in all experiments
the test persons were asked to move normally. Hence the inﬂuence of panic or pushing can
be excluded. Other possible reasons are e.g. the geometry of the bottleneck or the initial
conditions in front of the bottleneck. A detailed discussion will be possible together with the
experimental results presented in this paper and can be found in Section 4.
Another important question concerns the situation when a jam in front of a facility is present.
Predtechenskii and Milinskii [1] assume that in this case the ﬂow through the bottleneck is
determined by the ﬂow in front of the bottleneck. They suppose that the density inside the
jam will be higher than the density associated with the capacity and thus it is possible that
the reduced ﬂow in front of the bottleneck will cause a ﬂow through the bottleneck smaller
than the bottleneck-capacity.
Recapitulating the above discussion there are several open questions. The central one is if
the ﬂow equation in combination with the concept of a speciﬁc ﬂow is adequate for capacity
estimations leading to a linear increase of the capacity with the width. The next question is
why the experimental ﬂow measurements exceed the estimated capacities up to a factor of
four. The closing question is which ﬂow will tune in if a jam occur in front of the bottleneck
and if it is conserved at the value of the capacity.
To answer this questions and to resolve the discrepancies among the estimation results an
experiment is arranged where the density and the velocity and thus the ﬂow inside the bottle-
neck is measured while a jam occurs in front of the bottleneck. Our experiment is performed
under laboratory conditions with a homogeneous group of test persons and equal initial con-
ditions for the density and position of the test persons in front of the bottleneck. Exclusively
the width of the bottleneck and the number of the pedestrians are varied. For the analysis
the trajectories inside the bottleneck are determined and used to resolve the time dependence
of the ﬂow, the density and the velocity.

2 Experimental setup

Our experiment was arranged in the auditorium ‘Rotunde’ at the Central Institute for Applied
Mathematics (ZAM) of the Research Centre J¨ulich. The conﬁguration is shown in Figure 2.
The group of test persons was composed of students and ZAM staﬀ. The boundary of the
corridor in front of the bottleneck and the bottleneck was arranged from desks. The height
of the bottleneck assured a constant width from the hips to the shoulders of the test persons.

4

The length of the bottleneck amounted to lbck = 2.8 m. The holding areas ensured an equal
initial density of the pedestrian bulk in front of the bottleneck for each run. The distance
from the center of the ﬁrst holding area to the entrance of the bottleneck was three meter.

Figure 2: Experimental setup.
In the left drawing the position of the video cameras are
marked with circles. The holding and measurement areas are hatched. The photo shows the
situation for b=0.8 m in front of the entrance in the bottleneck.

All together 18 runs were performed to analyze the eﬀect of the bottleneck-width, b, and the
inﬂuence of the number of pedestrians, N . The width of the bottleneck was increased from
the minimal value of b = 0.8 m in steps of 0.1 m to a maximal value of b = 1.2 m. For every
width we performed three runs with N = 20, 40 and 60 pedestrians in front of the bottleneck.
At the beginning of each run N test persons were placed in the holding areas with a density
of ρini = 3.3 m−2. The test persons were advised to move through the bottleneck without
haste but purposeful. It was emphasized not to push and to walk with normal velocity. The
test persons started to move after an acoustic signal. The whole cycle of each run was ﬁlmed
by two cameras, one situated above the center of the bottleneck and the other above the
entrance of the bottleneck (indicated by the circles in Figure 2).

3 Data analysis

3.1 Speciﬁc ﬂow

In a ﬁrst step we have calculated the ﬂow on the basis of the crossing time of the ﬁrst and
the last pedestrian, according Equation 1.
In Table 2 we collect these values divided by the width, b, to examine if they approach a
constant value for the speciﬁc ﬂow, Js. For N = 60 the data show a small but systematic
increase of speciﬁc ﬂow with width indicating an inﬂuence of the zipper eﬀect and of the
boundaries of the bottleneck, where the optimization through the zipper eﬀect can not act.
Nevertheless this variation is small compared to the variation in Table 1 and for N < 60

partly washed out by ﬂuctuations. Furthermore for small N the time is not suﬃcient to reach
a stationary state. To control the inﬂuence of ﬂuctuations, non stationary states and how the
zipper eﬀect acts, the trajectories and the time development of density ρ(t), velocity v(t) and
ﬂow J(t) are analyzed.

3.2 Trajectories and probability distributions

For the determination of the trajectories a manual procedure, based on the standard video
recordings of the camera above the bottleneck (DV camera PAL format, 25 fps) is used.
These recordings are analyzed with the software tool Adobe After Eﬀects [18]. To determine
the trajectory the center of the head is marked and followed in time. For this procedure every
second frame (80 ms) is used. The trajectory of each pedestrian was exported to the format
Adobe Motion Exchange and reprocessed. To minimize the errors the reprocessing was used
to check the plausibility of the data and to correct distortions based on pixel sizes and camera
perspective.
For the further data analysis the individual trajectories (xi,j, yi,j, ti,j) were used. The index
i marks the pedestrian, while j marks the sequence of the points in time. To study the
microscopic properties and the time dependence of the ﬂow the individual time gap, ∆ti, is
introduced

Where < ∆ti > is the mean value of the time gaps between the crossings of two following
pedestrians.
In Figure 3 we have collected for the runs with N = 60 the trajectories, the probability distri-
bution to ﬁnd a pedestrian at the position x averaged over y and the probability distribution
of the individual time gaps, ∆ti, at center of the bottleneck at y = 0.4 m. For the deter-
mination of the time gaps at y = 0.4 m we interpolate linearly between adjacent trajectory
points with the current velocity. The double peak structure in the probability distribution
for b ≥ 0.9 m of the positions display the formation of lanes. The separation of the lanes is
continuously growing with the width of the bottleneck. As a consequence of the zipper eﬀect
one expects also a double peak distribution for the time gaps ∆t. However this is not so
articulated as in the separation of lanes in the position. One can only observe a broadening

of the time gap distribution with increasing b and a drift to smaller values. The changes in
these ﬁgures as a function of the width are all continuous except for the transition from one
to two lanes and there are no indications of a stepwise increase or decrease in any observable.

3.3 Time dependence of ρ, vi, and ∆ti

For the ﬁrst pedestrian passing the bottleneck in a run the velocity and density will be diﬀerent
from the velocity and the density of the following pedestrians. One expects that the density
will increase while the velocity will decrease in time. A systematic drift to a stationary state,
where only ﬂuctuation around a constant value will occur is expected. For the analysis of
the time dependence of the individual velocities, vi, and density, ρ, we calculate the following
quantities

vi(ti,j) =

yi,j+2 − yi,j−2
ti,j+2 − ti,j−2

.

(4)

The time, ti,j, corresponds to the ﬁrst trajectory point (xi,j, yi,j, ti,j) behind y = 0.4 m, the
center of the bottleneck. For the density ρ(t) we use the momentary number n(t) of persons
inside the measurement section reaching from y = [0.9 m, −0.1 m] at the instant t. With the
unit length of the observation area the density is

Figure 4 shows the time-development of the individual velocities and the density for the run
with N = 60 and b = 1.1 m. The concept of a momentary density in this small observation
area is problematic because of the small (1-4) number of persons involved and leads to large
ﬂuctuations in the density. But one can clearly identify the decrease of the velocity and the
increase of the density.
For the individual time gaps, see Eq. 3, a time dependence or a trend to a stationary state is
hard to identify, see Figure 5, because the velocity decrease and the density increase compen-
sate largely. A potential time dependence is covered by large and regular jumps from small
to high time gaps caused by the zipper eﬀect.
To ﬁnd stationary values for the velocity and density by means of regression analysis the tool
MINUIT [19] for function minimization is used with the following model function borrowed
from relaxation processes:

f (t) = fstat + A exp −

for

f (t) = v(t)

and f (t) = ρ(t)

(6)

The relaxation time τ characterizes the time in which a stationary state will be reached.
The amplitude A gives the diﬀerence between the stationary state and the initial velocity
or density. The velocity or density at the stationary state is labeled fstat. For the ﬁt we
use the data of all three runs for one width with diﬀerent N , see Figure 6. The resulting

stationary values and relaxation times are collected in Table 3. Note, that the model function

Table 3: Results for the ﬁt to vi(t) and ρ(t).

The results of the regression analysis are collected in Table 3. For b ≥ 1.0 m even with N = 60
the stationary state is not reached, see e.g. Figure 4. The results for A and τ indicate that
the relaxation into the stationary state is almost independent of the width. However, for a
ﬁnal judgment more data or a larger number of test persons would be necessary. Nevertheless,
the results are accurate enough to check at which position of the fundamental diagram the
stationary state will be located. Again, the increase of the stationary values for the density
ρstat can be explained by means of the zipper eﬀect in combination with boundary eﬀects.
Given that the space at the boundaries can not be used as eﬃcient as in the center of the
bottleneck the density will increase for bigger width. While the stationary values of the

fundamental diagramm. Again, for a ﬁnal judgment an improved data basis is needed.

4 Combined analysis with data from other experiments

In this section we compare and combine our results with the data of previous measurements.
We will show that the apparent discrepancies between the diﬀerent ﬂow measurements at bot-
tlenecks can be traced back to diﬀerent initial conditions. This allows a conclusive judgment
on the question if the dependence of the ﬂow and the bottleneck-width is linear. In addition
does these results have a bearing on the question at which ﬂow value a jam occurs.

4.1 Comparison with the data of other experiments

In Figure 7 we have collected experimental data for ﬂows through bottlenecks. All measure-
ments were performed under laboratory conditions. The amount of test persons ranged from
N = 30 to 180 persons. The inﬂuence of panic or pushing can be excluded as the collection
is limited to measurements where the test persons were asked to move normally.
However, the experimental arrangements under which this data were taken diﬀer in many
detailed respects which provide possible explanations for the discrepancies. Signiﬁcant diﬀer-
ences concern:

• the geometry of the bottleneck, i.e. its length and position with respect to the incoming

ﬂow.

• the initial conditions, i.e. initial density values and the initial distance between the test

persons and the bottleneck.

Figure 7: Inﬂuence of the width of a bottleneck on the ﬂow. Experimental data from other
authors at diﬀerent types of bottlenecks and initial conditions in comparison with the results
of the above described experiment.

The data of Nagai [16] and M¨uller [17] are shifted to higher ﬂows in comparison with the data
of Kretz, Muir and our data. The height of the ﬂows in the experiments of M¨uller and Nagai
can be explained by their use of much higher initial densities which amount to ρini ≈ 5 m−2.
That the initial density has this impact is conﬁrmed by the study of Nagai et al., see Figure
6 in [16]. There it is shown that for b = 1.2 m the ﬂow grows from J = 1.04 s−1 to 3.31 s−1
when the initial density is increased from ρini = 0.4 m−2 to 5 m−2.
Next we will discuss the inﬂuence of the geometry and the position of the bottleneck. As
can be seen in Figure 7 there is a fair agreement between our data and the results obtained
by Kretz. This indicates the minor importance of the bottleneck-length, given that in our
experiment it amounts to lbck = 2.8 m while Kretz has chosen a bottleneck of lbck = 0.4 m
length only.
While in our and Kretz’s experiment the bottleneck was centered, Nagai used a bottleneck
located on the left side of the corridor. The comparison of the measurements for b = 1.2 m
of Nagai for the initial densities of ρ = 1.66 m−2 (not displayed in Figure 7) with the data
of Kretz and our results show that the ﬂow of J ≈ 2.0 s−1 is in good agreement with
our measurements. The same applies to the ﬂow measured by Muir which is particularly
noteworthy since Muir has measured these values for the movement of a bottleneck in an air
plain, where even the corridor is very small and the bottleneck is build by the galley units
before the main embarkation point [20].
Finally we have to dicuss the diﬀerences between the ﬂow values of M¨uller and Nagai. As
noted above this can not be explained by the initial densities since both used similar (high)
values. However, M¨uller measured at a simple opening in a thin wall of shelves while Nagai
used a bottleneck with lbck = 0.4 m. This fact could be used to explain higher ﬂow values
for M¨uller, given the common and reasonable assumption that the ﬂow is correlated to the

11

liberty of action which is higher for less deep bottlenecks. However, just the opposite is being
observed, i.e. M¨uller’s result lie below Nagai’s data. A possible explanation is provided by
the diﬀerent distances from the bottleneck to the ﬁrst pedestrians at time t = 0. While Nagai
positioned the test persons directly in front of the bottleneck M¨uller arranged a distance
of 2.5 m between the exit and the ﬁrst pedestrians. Thus it is expected that the density
will decrease during the movement from the initial position to the bottleneck resulting in an
smaller density directly in front of the bottleneck.
From all this we conclude that details of the bottleneck geometry and position play a minor
role only while the initial density in front of the bottleneck has a major impact.

4.2 Linear dependence of ﬂow and bottleneck-width

As mentioned in the introduction one goal of this work is to examine if the ﬂow or the capacity
is a linear function of the width, b, of a bottleneck or if it grows in a stepwise manner, as
suggested by [14]. Such a stepwise growth would question the validity of the speciﬁc ﬂow
concept used in most guidelines, see Section 1.
However, the previous section has argued for the coherence of our data set and previous
measurements. All of these results show a linear growth with the width of the bottleneck, see
Figure 7. Only around b = 0.7 m it seems that the data of Kretz [15] show a small edge. The
edge is located exactly at the width where the zipper eﬀect can begin to act, i.e. provides no
evidence for a stepwise behavior in general.
Moreover does the alleged stepwise increase of the ﬂow follows from the assumption that inside
a bottleneck the formation of lanes with constant distance occurs. In [14] this assumption
is based on ﬂow measurements at two diﬀerent bottlenecks at b = 1 m and b = 2 m. It is
doubtful whether this results can be extrapolated to intermediate values of the width. In fact
our data show no evidence for the appearance of lanes with constant distance (see Section
3.2, in particular Figure 3).

4.3 The criteria for jam occurrence

The above results can be used to address a crucial question in pedestrian dynamics, namely
the criteria for the occurrence of a jam. As mentioned already in the introduction it is
commonly assumed that this happens when the incoming ﬂow (through a surface in front of
the bottleneck) exceeds the capacity of the bottleneck. Here the capacity of the bottleneck is
deﬁned as the maximum of the speciﬁc ﬂow, Js(ρ), times its width.
Our results from Section 3 can be used to examine which density and ﬂow inside the bottleneck
is present for a situation where a jam occurs in front of the bottleneck3. For this purpose the
ﬁtted values for ρstat and vstat are used (see Table 3).
Figure 8 indicates that the values for the stationary density derived from our experiment
are exactly located at the position where the fundamental diagram according to the SFPE-
Handbook and the guideline of Weidmann show the maximum of the ﬂow (while the absolute
value of the ﬂow exceeds the predicted values), i.e. ρ ≈ 1.8 m−2. This seems to support
the common jam-occurrence criteria. However, two observations cast doubt on this conclu-
sion. Already when discussing the data of M¨uller and Nagai we have mentioned that higher
that the maximal ﬂow can not be near
initial densities result in higher ﬂow values, i.e.

3A preliminary analysis of the situation one meter in front of the bottleneck entrance shows density ﬂuctu-

ations inside the jam between ρ = 4 to 6 m−2 independent from the width of the bottleneck.

Figure 8: Experimental data of the ﬂow and the associated density in the bottleneck in
comparison with experimental data for the fundamental diagram of unidirectional pedestrian
streams and the speciﬁcations for the fundamental diagram according to the SFPE Handbook
and the guidelines of Weidmann and PM.

ρ = 1.8 m−2. In addition do the fundamental diagrams of Mori [21], Hanking [22] and PM
display a completely diﬀerent shape. According to Mori and Hanking and in agreement with
the speciﬁcation of PM the ﬂow will increase from ρ ≈ 1.8 m−2 or stay constant with increas-
ing density. Moreover does the level of the ﬂow measured in our experiment conforms much
better with their speciﬁcation.
At this point it is necessary to look in the origin of the fundamental diagrams shown in
Figure 8. It seems that the most detailed one is given by Weidmann which used 25 data sets
for generating his fundamental diagram. But if one performs a more detailed examination of
the data which went into Weidmann’s combination it turns out that most measurements with
densities larger then ρ = 1.8 m−2 are performed with bidirectional streams, see [8, 9, 23–25].
In contrast to this, Hanking and Mori restrict their measurements on the unidirectional move-
ment of pedestrians. Their fundamental diagrams diﬀer notable from the fundamental dia-
gram of the SFPE and Weidmann for densities larger ρ = 1.8 m−2.
In accordance with
Predtechenskii and Milinskii we assume that the maximum of the fundamental diagram for
unidirectional movement is at much higher densities. Thus we conclude from our measure-
ments of densities and velocities that the ﬂow under normal conditions will not reach the
capacity deﬁned through the maximum of the fundamental diagram and that a jam occurs
well before the maximum is reached.
There are three possible reasons for jamming below the capacity limit. One is clearly ﬂow
ﬂuctuations. Local density maxima higher then cpacity-density cause obstructions that can be
resolved only if the incoming ﬂow is less than the outﬂow, which in this case is below capacity.
A second reason is in the local organization of the pedestrians. At high densities, the full ﬂow
requires a fairly regular positioning of persons. This may be achieved by prearranging them -

13

as in the experiments in [16,17] - or possibly by funneling the ﬂow into the bottleneck. Neither
the random arrival at a narrow passage out of the almost free motion in a wide room nor the
- also random - starting into the passage from waiting in a jam can achieve this. Therefor
the actual bottleneck is the entrance into the passage, while in the passage itself the ﬂow
corresponds to the lower density associated with the observed ﬂux (compare PM [1]). The
third reason is motivational, people usually prefer larger distances to the person in front than
necessary unless there is the danger of sombody else ﬁlling the gap - or some other incentive
for moving up close. These topics will be the subject of future research.

5 Summary

We have studied experimentally the ﬂow of unidirectional pedestrian streams through bottle-
necks under normal conditions. For the data analysis we used the trajectories to determine
the time development of the individual velocities, local densities and time gaps for diﬀerent
widths of the bottleneck. The analysis shows that for a small variation of the width quantities
like the time gap distribution or the lane distance change continuously if the zipper eﬀect is
acting. The results for velocities and densities are compared to common methods for the
capacity estimation and to experimental data from other studies.
Except for the edge at b ≈ 0.7 m due to zipper eﬀect starting to act all collected data for
ﬂow measurements show a linear and continuous increase with the bottleneck-width. The
linear dependency between the ﬂow and the width holds for diﬀerent kinds of bottlenecks and
initial conditions. Hence the basic ﬂow equation in combination with the use of the speciﬁc
ﬂow concept is justiﬁed for facilities with b > 0.7 m. Moreover does the comparison with
ﬂow measurements through bottlenecks of diﬀerent types and lengths show that the exact
geometry of the bottleneck is of only minor inﬂuence on the ﬂow.
The rise of the ﬂow through the bottleneck with an increase of the initial density in front
of the bottleneck from ρ = 1.8 m−2 to 5 m−2 indicates at least for this density region a
rising of the slope of the fundamental diagram for unidirectional streams. This is in disagree-
ment with most fundamental diagrams as documented in handbooks and guidelines but in
agreement with empirical fundamental diagrams restricted to unidirectional movement and
with the shape of the fundamental diagram according to Predtechenskii and Milinskii. Thus
the capacity deﬁned by the maximum of the fundamental diagram is expected for densities
substantial higher than ρ = 1.8 m−2. With respect to the absolute ﬂow values one needs
to bear in mind that our results were obtained with young probands and under laboratory
conditions.
Our measurements of densities and velocities inside the bottleneck show that the stationary
ﬂow will tune around densities of ρ ≈ 1.8 m−2 when a jam occurs in front of the bottleneck.
This contradicts the common assumption that a jam occurs only when the capacity is ex-
ceeded. While the continuity equation trivially implies that the capacity is the upper limit
for a jam producing ﬂow, do our results indicate that this happens for smaller ﬂow values al-
ready. Possible reasons are stochastic ﬂow ﬂuctuation, ﬂow interferences due to the necessity
of local organisation or psychological founded changes of the incentive during the access into
the bottleneck.
Tragic disasters like at the L¨owenbr¨au-Keller in Munich, Germany (1973), Bergisel in Austria
(1999) or Akashi Japan (2001) [26] have shown that already without the inﬂuence of panic
insuﬃcient dimensions of facilities can cause high densities in bottlenecks. At high densities

14

small interferences in the crowd can not be balanced and may cause fatalities due to people
stamped to the ground by high pressure. For a better evaluation of pedestrian facilities with
respect to safety it is necessary to explore under which circumstances such an increase of the
density inside the bottleneck occurs.
As a ﬁrst step our results can be used to improve the capacity estimations in planing guide-
lines and handbooks to prevent such situations.

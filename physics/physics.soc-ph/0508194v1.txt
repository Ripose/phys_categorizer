Abstract

Emergence of hierarchies is investigated by Monte Carlo simulation in a timid
society where all individuals are paciﬁst. The self-organiztion of hierarchies is
shown to occur in two steps as the population is increased, i.e. there are three
states, one egalitarian and two hierarchical states;the transition from the egali-
tarian to the ﬁrst hierarchical state is continuous and the transition from the ﬁrst
hierachical state to the second one is discontinuous. In the ﬁrst hierarchical soci-
ety, all individuals belong to either middle class or losers and no winners appear.
In the second hierarchical society, many winners emerge and the population of
the middle class is reduced. The hierarchy in the second hierarchical society is
stronger than the hierachy in a no-preference society studied by Bonabeau et al
[ Physica A217, 373 (1995)]

1 Introduction

The emergence of hierarchies is a common phenomenon in societies and animal groups.
In a pioneering work, Bonabeau et al.[1] have shown that a hierarchical society can
emerge spontaneously from an equal society by a simple algorithm of ﬁghting between
individuals diﬀusing on a square lattice. On the basis of results of Monte Carlo sim-
ulation and an analysis by a mean ﬁeld theory, they concluded that subcritical or
supercritical bifurcations exist in the formation of the hierarchical structure as the

some wealth or power which increases or decreases by winninng or losing in a ﬁght.
The essential processes of the model are diﬀusion, ﬁghting and spontaneous relaxation
of the wealth. Various societies can be modelled by specifying each process and the
emergence of the hierarchy depends strongly on the speciﬁcations.[2, 3]

In this paper, we investigate a variation of the model introduced by Bonabeau et
al.[1], where the diﬀusion algorithm is modiﬁed to include the eﬀect of the trend of
society. Namely, we study the emergence of hierarchies in a timid society, in which
an individual always tries to avoid ﬁghting and to ﬁght with the weakest among the
neighbors if he/she cannot avoid ﬁghting. By Monte Carlo simulation, we show that
the emergence of the hierarchy is retarded in the timid society compared to the no-
preference society investigated by Bonabeau et al. and that the transition to the

hierarchical state occurs in two successive transitions of a continuous and a discontin-
uous ones. Consequently, there exist three diﬀerent states in the society, one equal
and two hierarchical states.
In the ﬁrst hierarchical states, we see no winners but
losers and people in the middle class. In the second hierarchical states, many winners
emerge from the middle class. We also show that the distribution of wealth in the sec-
ond hierarchical state is wider compared to the hierarchical state of the no-preference
society.

In Sec. 2, our model is explained in detail. Results of Monte Carlo simulation are
presented in Sec. 3. In Sec. 4 the characteristics of the hierarchical states is analyzed
in detail. Section 5 is devoted to discussion.

2 A timid society

L square lattice, where every lattice
We consider N individuals diﬀusing on an L
site accomodates at most one individual. An individual is to move to one of nearest
neighbor sites according to the following protocol. When individual i tries to move to a
site occupied by j, i and j ﬁght each other. If i wins, i and j exchange their positions,
and if i loses, they keep their original positions. We associate each individual a quantity
which we call power or wealth. The power increases by unity for every victory and
decreases by unity for every loss. The probability Qij that i wins the ﬁght against j is
determined by the diﬀerence of their powers Fi and Fj as

where η is introduced as a controlling parameter. When η =
, the stronger one
always wins the ﬁght and when η = 0, the winning probability of both ones are equal.
We also assume that the power of individuals relaxes to zero when they do not ﬁght,
namely power Fi(t + 1) at time t + 1 is given by Fi(t) through[1]

∞

Fi(t + 1) = Fi(t)

µ tanh[Fi(t)].

Here, the unit of time is deﬁned by one Monte Carlo step during which every individual
is accessed once for move and µ represents an additional controlling parameter. This
relaxation rule indicates that people lose their wealth of a constant amount when their
power is large, and when their power is small, they lose it at a constant fraction,
namely they behave rather miserly. It also indicates that the negative wealth (debt)
can relax to zero in the similar manner. Note that this rerlaxation rule is critical to
the emergence of hierarchical society.[2]

We characterize the timid society by the preference of individuals in diﬀusion. In
the timid society, every individual favors not to ﬁght and thus it moves to a vacant
site if it exists. If no vacant sites exist in the nearest neighbors, then it moves to a site
occupied by an individual whose power is the smallest among the neighbors. When
more than two neighbors have the equal power, then an opponent is chosen randomly
from them.

We characterize the static status of the society by an order parameter σ which is

Here, N is the number of individuals, and Di and Si are the number of ﬁghts won and
lost, respectively, by individual i. Note that σ = 0 corresponds to an egalitarian status
and σ = 1/√12

in [0, 1]. After suﬃciently long Monte Carlo simulation, variation of σ is stabilized and
one can use it as an order parametrer.

We also monitor the population proﬁle by focusing on the winning probability. We
classify individuals into three groups by the number of ﬁghts which an individual won;
winners are individuals who won more than 2/3 of ﬁghts and losers are individuals who
won less than 1/3 of ﬁghts. Individuals between these groups are called middle class.

3 Monte Carlo simulation

Monte Carlo simulation was performed for N = 3500 individuals on the square lattice
with periodic boundary conditions from L = 60 to L = 180. We obtained the order
parameter σ2 and other quantities for 106 Monte Carlo steps.

Figure 1 shows the dependence of the order parameter σ2 on the density ρ = N/L2
for several values of η, where µ is ﬁxed to µ = 0.1. We can see two clear transitions;
one at a lower critical density ρC1 and the other at a higher critical density ρC2.
The transition at ρC1 is continuous and the transition at ρC2 is discontinuous. The
dependence of the critical densities ρC1 and ρC2 on parameter η is shown in Fig. 2.

We can identify three states for a given value of η; an egalitarian state for ρ<ρC1,
a hierarchical society of type I for ρC1<ρ<ρC2 and a hierachical society of type II for
ρC2<ρ<1. In the egalitarian society, winners and losers lose their memory of previous
ﬁght before they engage in the next ﬁght, and thus they changes their status in time.

In the hierarchical state, a winner keeps winning and a loser keeps losing. We discuss
the diﬀerence between type I and type II hierarchical society in the next section.

The results strongly depend on µ. We show the phase boundary on the ρ-µ plane

for η = 0.05 in Fig. 3.

4 Two hierarchical societies

In order to investigate the structure of the hierarchical states, we analyze proﬁle of
population. The dependence of the population of each class is plotted against the
density in Fig. 4. Rapid changes of the populations signify emergence of diﬀerent state
of the hierarchical societies. In the egalitarian state ρ<ρC1, all individuals belong to
the middle class as expected. In the hierachical society I ρC1<ρ<ρC2, some individuals
become losers whose number increases as the density is increased, but no winners are
ρC2, many winners appear and the population in
seen. In the hierachical state II ρ
the middle class is reduced signiﬁcantly.

Figures 5 (a), (b) and (c) show the spacial distribution of individuals after 106
Monte Carlo steps in the egalitarian, the ﬁrst hierarchical and the second hierarchical
states, respectively. No speciﬁc spatial inhomogeneity is observed in the timid society.
In order to see details of the hierarchical structure, we plot the population as a
function of the density and the winning probablity in Fig. 6. From this plot, we
conclude that (1) in the hierarichical state I, people in the middle class with slightly
higher winning probability increase, but no winners are seen and (2) in the hierarchical
state II, the most of winners have very high winning probability, while people in the
losers and the middle class are distributed in a wide region of the winning probability,

5 Discussion

We have investigated the emergence of self-organized hierarchies in the timid society.
Our results show that the emergence of the hierarchical state in the timid society is
retarded compared to the no-preference society. This delay is natural since individuals
in the timid society tend to avoid ﬁghting and thus the wealth is distriruted more or less
evenly among individuals when the population is low. Furthermore, the emergence of
the hierarchical society in the timid society occurs in two steps, and the ﬁrst transition
is continuous and the second one is discontinuous. The strength of the hierarchy in
the high density region is stronger in the timid society compared to the no-preference
society. For the same choice of η = 0.05 and µ = 0.1, σ2 for the former case is twice as
large as the latter[1].

To understand these behaviors, we ﬁrst remind the fact that the the hierarchical
society emerges when the power cannot relax before the subsequet ﬁght. In the timid
society, an idividual can avoid ﬁghting when the density is low, and thus the ealitarian
state is favored for low densities. In the timid society, weaker individuals have more
chance to be challenged and thus to lose their power, and stronger ones has less chance
to ﬁght and their power stay near zero. This situation corresponds to the hierarchical
state I. When the density is increased above the upper critical density, all individuals
have more chance to ﬁght and thus stronger individuals become much stronger.

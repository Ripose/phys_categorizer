Summary. The Japanese shareholding network at the end of March 2002 is
studied. To understand the characteristics of this network intuitively, we visu-
alize it as a directed graph and an adjacency matrix. Especially detailed fea-
tures of networks concerned with the automobile industry sector are discussed
by using the visualized networks. The shareholding network is also considered
as an undirected graph, because many quantities characterizing networks are
deﬁned for undirected cases. For this undirected shareholding network, we
show that a degree distribution is well ﬁtted by a power law function with
an exponential tail. The exponent in the power law range is γ = 1.8. We also
show that the spectrum of this network follows asymptotically the power law
distribution with the exponent δ = 2.6. By comparison with γ and δ, we ﬁnd
a scaling relation δ = 2γ − 1. The reason why this relation holds is attributed
to the local tree-like structure of networks. To clarify this structure, the cor-
relation between degrees and clustering coeﬃcients is considered. We show
that this correlation is negative and ﬁtted by the power law function with the
exponent α = 1.1. This guarantees the local tree-like structure of the network
and suggests the existence of a hierarchical structure. We also show that the
degree correlation is negative and follows the power law function with the
exponent ν = 0.8. This indicates a degree-nonassortative network, in which
hubs are not directly connected with each other. To understand these features
of the network from the viewpoint of a company’s growth, we consider the
correlation between the degree and the company’s total assets and age. It is
clariﬁed that the degree and the company’s total assets correlate strongly, but
the degree and the company’s age have no correlation.

1 Introduction

The economy is regarded as a set of activities of heterogeneous agents in
complex networks. However, many traditional studies in economics are for
the activities of homogeneous agents in simple networks, where we call reg-
ular networks and random networks simple networks. To overcome such an
unrealistic situation many eﬀorts have been made, and a viewpoint of hetero-
geneous agents has emerged. However, simple networks are adapted in many
of the studies of heterogeneous agents. Hence it is important to introduce the
true structure of real world networks. Recently, the study of complex networks
has revealed the true structure of real world networks: WWW, the Internet,
social networks, biological networks, etc. [1][4][5][12]. However the true struc-
ture of the economic network is not well known. Hence the purpose of this
study is to reveal it.

As is commonly known, if we intend to discuss networks, we must deﬁne
the nodes and edges. Here, edges represent the relationship between nodes.
In business networks, the candidates for the nodes are individuals, compa-
nies, industry categories, countries, etc. In this study we consider companies
as nodes. Hence, in the next step, we must deﬁne the relationship between
companies. To deﬁne it, we use three viewpoints: ownership, governance, and
activity. The ownership is characterized by the shareholding of companies, and
the networks constructed by this relationship are considered in this article.
The governance is characterized by the interlocking of directors, and networks
of this type are frequently represented by a bipartite graph that is constructed
with corporate boards and directors. The activity networks are characterized
by many relationships: trade, collaboration, etc.

Although we use tree point of view, these have relations with each other.
For example, if the owners of a company change, then the directors of that
company will change. If the directors of the company change, then the ac-
tivities of the company will change. If the activities of the company change,
then the decisions of the owners and directors will change, and sometimes the
owners and the directors will change.

In this article we consider Japanese shareholding networks at the end of
March 2002 (see Ref. [9] for shareholding networks in MIB, NYSE, and NAS-
DAQ). In this study we use data which is published by TOYO KEIZAI INC.
This data provides lists of shareholders for 2,765 companies that are listed on
the stock market or the over-the-counter market. Almost all of the sharehold-
ers are non-listed ﬁnancial institutions (commercial banks, trust banks, and
insurance companies) and listed non-ﬁnancial companies. In this article we
ignore shares held by oﬃcers and other individuals. The lengths of the share-
holder lists vary with the companies. The most comprehensive lists contain
information on the top 30 shareholders. Based on this data we construct a
shareholding network.

This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, we consider the visualization
of the shareholding network as a directed graph and an adjacency matrix. The

visualization of networks is a primitive, but powerful tool to intuitively under-
stand the characteristics of networks. As an example, we especially consider
networks concerned with the automobile industry sector. In Sec. 3, we treat
the shareholding network as an undirected network. This is because many
useful quantities characterizing networks are deﬁned for undirected cases. We
consider the degree distribution, spectrum, degree correlation, and the corre-
lation between the degree and the clustering coeﬃcient. In Sec. 4, we discuss
correlations between the degree and the company’s total assets and age. Sec-
tion 5 is devoted to a summary and discussion.

2 Directed networks

If we draw edges from shareholders to companies, we can obtain shareholding
networks as directed graphs. The primitive way to study networks is to use a
visualization of them. The visualization of the Japanese shareholding network
at the end of March 2002 is shown in the left panel of Fig. 1. This ﬁgure
is drawn by Pajek, which is a program for analyzing large networks [13]. In
this ﬁgure, the open circles correspond to companies, and arrows are drawn
based on shareholding relationships. The network is constructed from 3,152
nodes and 23,064 arrows. This ﬁgure is beautiful, but it is diﬃcult to obtain
characteristics of this network.

Frequently, networks are represented by adjacency matrices. Here the adja-
cency matrix for the directed graph, M d
ij, is chosen based on the shareholding
relation: If the i-th company is a shareholder of the j-th company, we assume
M d
ij = 0. The size of this matrix (network) is N = 3, 152.
The adjacency matrix is shown in the right panel of Fig. 1. In this ﬁgure, the

ij = 1; otherwise, M d

rows correspond to companies and the columns correspond to shareholding
companies. The list of companies and the list of shareholding companies are
the same. In this ﬁgure, the black dots correspond to M d
ij = 1, and the others
correspond to M d

ij = 0. The number of black dots is 23,063.

To deﬁne this adjacency matrix we arranged the order of companies ac-
cording to the company’s code number that is deﬁned based on industry cate-
gories. The solid lines in this ﬁgure indicate industry categories. We make two
observations: (i) Dots are distributed in all industry categories in the ranges
where ﬁnancial institutions (banks and insurance companies) are the share-
holders; (ii) The density of the black dots is relatively high in each box, except
for the ﬁnancial sector. This indicates that we frequently ﬁnd companies and
shareholders in the same industry category for non-ﬁnancial ﬁrms. Hence this
network shows ”assortative mixing” on the industry category, except for the ﬁ-
nancial institutions. The concept of (dis)assortativity is explained in Ref. [11].

2.1 Shareholding network constructed from companies in the
automobile industry sector

Here, we consider a network constructed from companies belonging to the au-
tomobile industry sector. This sector corresponds to the range shown in the

Heterogeneous Economic Networks

right panel in Fig. 1. The visualization of this network is shown in Fig. 2. In
this ﬁgure, we include company names only for four major automobile indus-
try companies: Toyota Motor, Nissan Motor, Honda Motor, and Mitsubishi
Motor.

If the direction of the arrows is ignored, then Toyota, Honda, and Mit-
subishi are connected to each other with two edges through the shortest path.
Nissan and Toyota are connected with three edges through the shortest path,
and this is also applicable to the case of Nissan and Mitsubishi. However, we
need ﬁve edges to connect Nissan and Honda through the shortest path. In
addition, this path must run through Toyota or Mitsubishi. We presently have
no idea how to explain such a network structure, but we believe that a time
series analysis of networks is important.

This ﬁgure shows that these four major companies have many edges. In
the graph theory, the degree of a node is deﬁned by the number of other nodes
to which it is attached. The distribution of the degree is an important quan-
tity to study networks [3]. It is well known that the degree distribution of a
regular network is represented by the δ-function, because each node has the
same degree in the regular network. It is also well known that the degree dis-
tribution of random networks, which are proposed by Erd¨os and R´eny, follows
the Poisson distribution. A node with a large degree is called a hub. Hence
these four major automobile industry companies are hubs in the network. In
Sec. 3.1, the details of a study about the degree distribution of the network
are explained.

In this ﬁgure, we can ﬁnd that almost no hubs are directly connected. These
hubs are mediated by companies, which have a small degree. Networks with
such a characteristic are called uncorrelated networks or degree-nonassortative
networks [11], and are characterized by a negative correlation between degrees.
This is explained in terms of a degree correlation [14] in Sec. 3.2. Intuitively,
this nature of the shareholding network is diﬀerent from that of human net-
works. This is because, in human networks, for example in the friendship net-
work, the hubs in the network correspond to persons with many friends, and
are also friends with each other with a high probability. Networks with such
characteristics are called correlated networks or degree-assortative networks,
and are characterized by a positive correlation between degrees.

Suppose that a node has k neighbors; then at most k(k − 1)/2 edges can
exist to connect the neighbors with each other. Hence the possible number of
triangles (minimum loops) containing this node is also k(k − 1)/2. The ratio
between the possible number of triangles and that of the actually existing
triangles deﬁnes a clustering coeﬃcient [20]. As we can see in this ﬁgure,
the clustering coeﬃcient is small for hubs, while it is large for nodes with a
small degree. Hence it is expected that degrees and clustering coeﬃcients are
negatively correlated. The details are explained in Sec. 3.3.

This ﬁgure also shows that the network is constructed from subgraphs: tri-
angles, squares, pentagons, etc. However, not all subgraphs occur with equal
frequency. Hence if networks contain some subgraphs as compared to random-

ized networks, these subgraphs characterize the networks. These characteristic
subgraphs are the building blocks of networks, and are called network motifs
[10][17]. Although network motifs are not discussed in this article, the spec-
trum of the network is considered. This is a primitive way to study subgraphs,
and the details are discussed in Sec. 3.4.

2.2 Shareholding network constructed from edges drawn from the
outside of the automobile industry sector to the inside of it

Figure 3 is constructed from edges drawn from the outside of the automo-
bile industry sector to the inside of it. To draw this ﬁgure, for simplicity, we
ignored the arrows connecting ﬁnancial institutions and automobile industry
companies. In this ﬁgure the open circles correspond to non-automobile in-
dustry companies, and the ﬁlled circles correspond to automobile industry
companies. Arrows are drawn from the open circles to the ﬁlled circles. The
network is divided into many subgraphs, but there exists one large lump. This
ﬁgure contains only Mitsubishi Motors of the four major automobile compa-
nies. This means that Mitsubishi Motor is governed by companies outside the
automobile industry sector.

2.3 Shareholding network constructed from edges drawn from the
inside of the automobile industry sector to the outside of it

Figure 4 is constructed from edges drawn from the inside of the automobile
industry sector to the outside of it. As in the previous case, the open circles
correspond to non-automobile industry companies, and the ﬁlled circles corre-
spond to automobile industry companies. In this case arrows are drawn from
the ﬁlled circles to the open circles. The network is divided into many sub-
graphs, but a large lump exists. We can see that major automobile industry
companies are also major shareholders of non-automobile industry companies,
except for Nissan Motor. It is expected that such a structure emerged after the
year 1999 when Nissan and Renault announced their strategic alliance. Com-
paring this ﬁgure and Figs. 2 and 3 makes us believe that Toyota, Honda and
Nissan are leaders in the automobile industry sector, and especially Toyota
and Honda are also leaders in the Japanese economy.

p(k) ≈ k−γ with the exponent γ = 1.8, and the dashed lines correspond to the

3 Undirected network

As shown in Sec. 2, the visualization of networks is a powerful method to
understand the characteristics of networks. However this method is not always
useful. Hence many quantities have been proposed to obtain the characteristics
of networks . In the previous section, the shareholding network is represented
by a directed graph, but we consider it as an undirected network in this section.
This is because many quantities characterizing networks are for undirected
cases. In this case, the adjacency matrix M u
ij is chosen: If the i-th company
is a shareholder of the j-th company, we assume M u
ji = 1; otherwise,
M u

ij = 0. Hence this matrix is symmetrical.

ij = M u

3.1 Degree distribution

A degree is the number of edges that attach to a node. In terms of the ad-
jacency matrix, the degree of node i, ki, is deﬁned by ki ≡ P
ij. The
log-log plot of the degree distribution is shown in the left panel of Fig. 5,
and the semi-log plot is shown in the right panel of Fig. 5. In this ﬁgure, the
horizontal axis corresponds to the degree and the vertical axis corresponds to
the cumulative probability.

j=1 M u

In these ﬁgures, the solid lines correspond to the linear ﬁtting with the least
square method by the power law function, and the dashed lines correspond
to that by the exponential function. As we can see, the degree distribution
follows the power law distribution with an exponential tail. The probability
density function (PDF) p(k) in the power law range is given by

p(k) ∝ k

Fig. 6. A log-log plot of the degree correlation (left) and that of the correlation
between the degree and the clustering coeﬃcient (right). In the left panel, the solid
line corresponds to the ﬁtting by the power law function hknni(k) ≈ k−ν with the
exponent ν = 0.8. In the right panel, the solid line corresponds to the ﬁtting by the
power law function C(k) ≈ k−α with the exponent α = 1.1.

where the exponent γ = 1.8, and that in the exponential range is given by

p(k) ∝ e

−β(k−k0).

The exponential range is constructed of ﬁnancial institutions, and the power
law range is mainly constructed of non-ﬁnancial ﬁrms. It has also been shown
that the degree distributions of diﬀerent networks in the economy also show
power law distributions [18].

3.2 Degree correlation

To obtain more detailed characteristics of networks, the degree correlation
has been considered [14]. The nearest neighbors’ average degree of nodes with
degree k, hknni, is deﬁned by

′

′

hknni = X
k
where pc(k′|k) is the conditional probability that a link belonging to a node
with degree k points to a node with degree k′.

pc(k

|k),

k

The log-log plot of degree correlation is shown in the left panel of Fig. 6. In
this ﬁgure, the horizontal axis corresponds to the degree and the vertical axis
corresponds to hknni, i.e., the nearest neighbors’ average degree of nodes with
degree k. We ﬁnd that the high degree range has a small value of hknni. This
means that hubs are not directly connected with each other in this network.
Networks with this characteristic are called uncorrelated networks, which are
also found in biological networks and WWW. On the other hand, networks

10

Wataru Souma, Yoshi Fujiwara, and Hideaki Aoyama

with a positive correlation are called correlated networks, and are found in
social and architectural networks.

In Fig. 6, the solid line is the ﬁtting by the power law function in the tail

part with the least square method:

hknni(k) ∝ k

−ν,

where the exponent ν = 0.8.

3.3 Clustering coeﬃcient

Cliques in networks are quantiﬁed by a clustering coeﬃcient [20]. Suppose
that a node i has ki edges; then at most ki(ki − 1)/2 edges can exist between
them. The clustering coeﬃcient of node i, Ci, is the fraction of these allowable
edges that actually exist ei:

Ci =

2ei
ki(ki − 1)

.

The clustering coeﬃcient is approximately equal to the probability of ﬁnding
triangles in the network. The triangle is the minimum loop. Hence if node
i has a small value of Ci, then the probability of ﬁnding loops around this
node is low. This means that the network around this node is locally tree-
like. The correlation between ki and Ci is shown in the right panel of Fig. 6.
This ﬁgure shows that clustering coeﬃcients have a small value in the high
degree range. This means that the shareholding network has a local tree-like
structure asymptotically.

The solid line in the right panel of Fig. 6 is the linear ﬁtting by the power

law function with the least square method:

C(k) ∝ k

−α,

where the exponent α = 1.1. Such a scaling property of the distribution of
clustering coeﬃcients is also observed in biological networks, and motivates
the concept of hierarchical networks [15][16].

3.4 Spectrum

Here we discuss the spectrum of the network, i.e., the distribution of eigen-
values of the adjacency matrix. The distribution around the origin is shown
in the left panel of Fig. 7. In this ﬁgure the horizontal axis is an eigenvalue
λi and the vertical axis is a frequency. As is well known, if the network is
completely random the distribution is explained by Wigner’s semi-circle law.
However, Fig. 7 is apparently diﬀerent from the semi-circle distribution. We
make four observations (see also Ref. [6]): (i) A δ peak at λi = 0, indicating the
localized eigenstates that are produced by the dead-end vertices ; (ii) δ peaks

at λi = ±1, indicating the existence of approximately inﬁnite long chains;
(iii) A ﬂat shape in the range −1 < λi < 1 except for λi = 0, indicating the
existence of long chains constructed from weakly connected nodes, i.e., nodes
with small degrees; and (iv) A fat tail.

The log-log plot of the eigenvalue distribution is shown in the right panel
of Fig. 7 (see also Ref. [19]). In this ﬁgure the horizontal axis is the absolute
value of eigenvalues |λi|, and the vertical axis is the cumulative probability.
The plus symbols represent the distribution of the negative eigenvalues, and
the cross symbols represent that of the positive eigenvalues. This ﬁgure shows
that the shape of distribution in the positive eigenvalue range and that in
the negative eigenvalue range are almost the same. The linear ﬁtting with the
least square method to the tail part is shown by the solid line in the ﬁgure.
This ﬁtting suggests that the PDF of the eigenvalue ρ(λ) is asymptotically
given by

ρ(λ) ∝ |λ|

−δ ,

where the exponent δ = 2.6. If we compare the values of γ and δ, we can ﬁnd
the scaling law: δ = 2γ − 1.

It has recently been shown under an eﬀective medium approximation that
the PDF of eigenvalue ρ(λ) is asymptotically represented by that of the degree
distribution p(k):

ρ(λ) ≃ 2 |λ| p(λ2),

if the network has a local tree-like structure [6]. Therefore, if p(k) asymptoti-
cally follows the power law distribution, ρ(λ) also asymptotically follows the
power law distribution, and we can obtain the scaling relation δ = 2γ − 1.
In addition, the local tree-like structure is guaranteed by the right panel of
Fig. 6.

4 Correlation between degree and company’s total assets
and age

It is interesting to construct models that can explain the topology of share-
holding networks. However, in this section, we consider the correlation between
the degree and the company’s total assets and age. In many complex networks,
it is diﬃcult to quantitatively characterize the nature of nodes. However, in
the case of economic networks, especially networks constructed of companies,
we can obtain the nature of nodes quantitatively. We consider this to be a
remarkable characteristic of business networks, and this allows us to under-
stand networks in terms of the company’s growth. This is the reason why we
consider the correlation between the degree and the company’s total assets
and age.

The log-log plot of the distribution of the company’s asset is shown in the
left panel of Fig. 8. In this ﬁgure, the horizontal axis is the assets with the
unit of millions of yen, and the vertical axis is the cumulative probability. This
ﬁgure shows that the distribution in the intermediate range follows the power
law distribution. In this case, the distribution is for companies listed on the
stock market or the over-the-counter market. The completeness of data is a
problem in extracting the true nature of the total asset distribution. However,
it has been shown that data satisfying this completeness shows more clearly
the power law distribution of the total assets [7].

The semi-log plot of the distribution of the company’s age is shown in the
right panel of Fig. 8. In this ﬁgure, the horizontal axis is the age with the unit
of months, and the vertical axis is the cumulative probability. This ﬁgure shows
that the distribution follows approximately the exponential distribution. It is
expected that the age of companies has a relation with their lifetime, and it is
also clariﬁed that the lifetime of bankrupted companies follows the exponential
distribution [8].

and the vertical axis is the company’s total assets with the unit of millions of
yen. This ﬁgure shows that the degree and the total assets positively correlate.
The semi-log plot of the correlation between degrees and the company’s
age is shown in the right panel of Fig. 9. In this ﬁgure the horizontal axis is
the degree, and the vertical axis is the company’s age with the unit of months.
This ﬁgure shows that the degree and the company’s age have no correlation.
These two results suggest that the degree of companies has a relation with
their total assets, but no relation with their age. This result means that the
size of the company is an important factor to consider with regard to growing
economic networks, but the age of the company is not. Old companies are
not necessarily big companies. Hence knowing the dynamics of the company’s
growth is a key concept in considering growing economic networks [2].

5 Summary

In this paper we considered the Japanese shareholding network at the end
of March 2002, and found some of the characteristics of this network. How-
ever, there are many unknown facts about the characteristics of shareholding
networks. For example, these include time series changes of networks, the as-
pect of weighted networks, ﬂows in networks, and the centrality of networks.
Together with these studies, it is also important to study the dynamics of
a company’s growth. It is expected that the dynamics of economic networks
cam be explained in terms of the dynamics of the company’s growth.

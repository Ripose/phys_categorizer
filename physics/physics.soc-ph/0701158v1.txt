Abstract

Recent studies have revealed a number of striking dependence patterns in
high frequency stock price dynamics characterizing probabilistic interrelation
between two consequent price increments x (push) and y (response) as de-
scribed by the bivariate probability distribution P(x, y) [1, 2, 3, 4]. There are
two properties, the market mill asymmetries of P(x, y) and predictability due
to nonzero z-shaped mean conditional response, that are of special impor-
tance. Main goal of the present paper is to put together a model reproducing
both the z-shaped mean conditional response and the market mill asymmetry
of P(x, y) with respect to the axis y = 0. We develop a probabilistic model
based on a multi-component ansatz for conditional distribution P(y| x) with
push-dependent weights and means describing both properties. A relation-
ship between the market mill asymmetry and predictability is discussed. A
possible connection of the model to agent-based picture is outlined.

1 Introduction

This paper is based on recent results on high frequency conditional dynam-
In [2, 3, 4] we have described several
ics in the stock market [1, 2, 3, 4].
new dependence structures characterizing high frequency stock dynamics -
the market mill patterns corresponding to various asymmetries character-
izing the bivariate probability distribution P(x, y) of two consecutive price
increments x (push) and y (response). We have also discussed a number
of eﬀects that are best described in terms of the moments of conditional
distribution P(y| x) of response y at given push x. All the conditional mo-
ments studied (mean, standard deviation, skew,normalized hypercumlant)
reveal pronounced dependence on push x. A nonzero z-shaped mean condi-
tional response implying probabilistic predictability of a price increment from
knowing the previous one is of special interest. In this paper we will focus on
building a probabilistic model for both nonlinear z-shaped conditional mean
response and corresponding market mill asymmetry pattern of P(x, y) with
respect to the axis y = 0.

The issue of price predictability is perhaps the most important one in
theoretical ﬁnance. In the ideally eﬃcient market predicting the future price
increment using the historical data, e.g. the value of the preceding incre-
ment, is impossible. If one describes price dynamics as a stochastic process,
it should have zero conditional mean hyix = 0, i.e. be a martingale, see e.g.
[5, 6, 7]. Let us stress that an existence of nonlinear dependence patterns
related to the higher moments of conditional distribution does not contra-
dict the martingale property and thus the weak form market eﬃciency. Such
dependencies were intensively studied, especially in the framework of condi-
tional regressive dynamics [7, 8].

An appearance of nonlinear mean conditional response shows that within
the standard paradigm of regression models formulated as a noisy mapping
of push x into response y, i.e. y = f (x) + ε, the mapping f (x) = hyix
is nonlinear. Thus we are dealing with a nonlinear dynamical system, see
[9, 10]. In ﬁnancial applications a particular class of such models, the
e.g.
threshold autoregression models [11] were used in describing the properties
of interest rates, see e.g. [12].

At a fundamental level it is necessary to describe the nonlinear mean
conditional response in terms of market ineﬃciency leading to probabilistic
predictability. Some examples of such predictability were discussed in [6].
Recently the issue of probabilistic predictability was discussed in the context

2

of agent-based modeling of ﬁnancial market dynamics [13].

At a phenomenological level we need to build a probabilistic model ex-
plaining the origin of both nonlinear predictability of the mean conditional
response and the corresponding market mill pattern within a simple and in-
tuitive probabilistic model. This is the main objective of the present paper.
When constructing a probabilistic model describing both the nonlinear
conditional response and the market mill phenomena we shall employ a step-
by-step approach. First, we provide an analytical description of the mean
conditional response hyix. Second, we consider a simple dynamical system’s
version of noisy conditional dynamics characterized by the observed nonlinear
mean conditional response dressed by an additive noise. We show that this
picture does not allow to reproduce the market mill asymmetry associated
with conditional response. Finally, we present a version of noisy conditional
dynamics characterized by the push-dependent mixture of conditional distri-
butions allowing to reproduce both the nonlinear mean conditional response
and the corresponding market mill asymmetry.
The outline of the paper is as follows.
In Section 2 we start with describing basic quantitative characteristics
of the asymmetry of conditional response and describe an algorithm allow-
ing to reconstruct a full bivariate push-response distribution P(x, y) from
some model conditional distribution P(y| x). In paragraph 2.2 we describe
a single-component conditional distribution corresponding to conventional
noisy conditional dynamics that, by construction, reproduces an observed
nonlinear dependence of mean conditional response. We show that this model
gives rise to an asymmetry pattern very diﬀerent from the market mill one.
In paragraph 2.3 we propose a multicomponent conditional distribution of
response at given push P(y| x).
Its simple version with constant weights
considered in paragraph 2.3.1 is shown to reproduce the market mill pat-
tern but not the nonlinear mean conditional response. A version with push-
dependent weights considered in paragraph 2.3.2 is shown to produce both
the market-mill shaped asymmetry of the asymmetric component of P(x, y)
and the nonlinearity of the conditional mean response hyix. In paragraph
2.4 we summarize the model-dependent relationships between the nonlinear
predictability and the market mill pattern. We proceed with comments on
possible relation of the proposed probabilistic model to agent-based model-
ing of ﬁnancial dynamics in paragraph 2.5 and conclude the section with a
discussion of the limitations of the proposed probabilistic model in paragraph
2.6.

In Section 3 we summarize the results of the present paper.

2 Modeling the structure of conditional re-

sponse

2.1 General considerations

At the basic level a probabilistic interrelation of push x and response y is
described by the bivariate distribution P(x, y). As already mentioned in the
Introduction, in preceding papers [2, 3, 4] we have described a number of
interesting eﬀects originating in the particular features of this distribution.
In the present paper we shall focus on building a model describing two such
phenomena:

• Predictability of response at given push due to nontrivial nonlinear z -

shaped conditional mean response hyix

.

• Market mill asymmetry of P(x, y) with respect to the axis y = 0 .

These eﬀects are illustrated in Figs. 1,2 correspondingly.

Both eﬀects originate from the nontrivial asymmetric component P a(x, y)

of the distribution P(x, y):

P a =

(P(x, y) − P(x, −y))

(1)

1
2

The market mill dependence pattern refers to the speciﬁc shape of the positive
component P a(p)(x, y) ≡ P a(x, y) · Θ [P a(x, y)] of P a(x, y), where Θ is a
Heaviside step function. In turn, an emergence of nonlinear z-shaped mean
conditional response hyix is quantiﬁed by the corresponding properties of the
asymmetric component P a(y| x) of the conditional distribution P(y| x) ≡
P(x, y)/P(x):

hyix =

dy y P a(y| x)

Z

(2)

In constructing a model describing both nonlinear conditional response

and market mill phenomena we shall employ a step-by-step approach.

In both above-described cases the speciﬁcation of noisy conditional dy-
namics is made in terms of model conditional response distribution at given

4

push P(y| x). To establish a quantitative link between the hypothesized con-
ditional distribution P(y| x) and the full distribution P(x, y) one has, as fol-
lows from the deﬁnition of the conditional distribution P(y| x) ≡ P(x, y)/P(x),
to reconstruct the marginal distribution P(x). This can be done by exploit-
ing the fact that marginal distributions of push P(x) and response P(y) are
identical, so that the marginal distribution satisﬁes, for given conditional
distribution P(y| x), the following integral equation on P(x):

P(y) =

dx P(x) P(y| x)

(3)

Z

In what follows Eq. (3) will be used for numerical reconstruction of the
marginal distribution.

(4)

(5)

2.2 Single-component conditional distribution

Let us ﬁrst consider a single-component model conditional distribution of the
form

P(y| x) ≡ P(y − m(x)) ,

where m(x) ≡ hyix is a mean conditional response having [2] the characteris-
tic z - shaped form. To be concrete let us parametrize the push dependence
of mean conditional response in the case where x and y correspond to price
increments in 3-minutes time intervals as follows:

m(x) ≡ hyix =

0.14 − 0.24 | x| 0.15

· x

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

In Fig. 3 we plot the analytical approximation (5) together with correspond-
ing market data from Fig. 1.

To completely specify the conditional dynamics (6,4) we have to choose a
functional form of the distribution P(ε), where ε ≡ y − m(x). Our choice is
a Laplace distribution P L(ε) = (0.5/σ) exp(−| ε|/σ) with3 σ = $ 0.052. The
model conditional distribution is thus given by P(y| x) = P L(y − m(x)).

Using Eq. (3) one can check that it is solved by P(x) = P L(x), so that
the full bivariate probability distribution P(x, y) is completely speciﬁed. Its
antisymmetric component is plotted in Fig. 4 (a). We conclude that re-
constructing the conditional dynamics as described by the single-component
distribution (4) with appropriate push - dependent weight (5) leads to the

two-dimensional asymmetry pattern very diﬀerent from the market mill one
in Fig. 2, so here one has a model with proper nonlinear mean conditional
response but with a wrong asymmetry pattern.

Let us note that the probabilistic model (4,5) corresponds to a dynamical
system with nonlinear mapping x =⇒ m(x) dressed by additive noise ε with
distribution P(ε) and zero mean hεi = 0:

y = m(x) + ε

(6)

We see that a description in terms of a dynamical system (6) explains (by
construction) the predictability related to the nonlinear z-shaped dependence
of the conditional mean response on push but leads to the push-response
asymmetry structure very diﬀerent from the observed market mill shape.

2.3 Multi-component conditional distribution

Let us now construct a conditional distribution P(y| x) ensuring the z-shaped
mean conditional response in a diﬀerent fashion. From the analysis of [2, 3, 4]
we know that the asymmetry in question is relatively weak, so that a domi-
nant component of P(y| x) should be symmetric with respect to the reﬂection
y → −y and, correspondingly, its dominant peak should be at y = 0. In ad-
dition to the symmetric component P 0(y| x) having a constant weight w0
the distribution should include two asymmetric components P ±(y| x) having
push-dependent weights w±(x):

P(y | x) = w+(x) P +(y | x) + w0 P 0(y | x) + w−(x) P −(y | x)
(7)
where w+(x) + w0 + w−(x) = 1. Below we shall take w0 = 0.85. The dis-
tributions P ±(y| x) have peaks at y±
∗ ) = ±sign(x), so that
the component P +(y| x) corresponds to a trend-following response, whereas
the component P −(y| x) corresponds to a contrarian one. Below we shall use
a simple parametrization of m±(x) ensuring these properties:

∗ such that sign(y±

x ≡ m+(x) = (1 + q) x
x ≡ m0(x) = 0
x ≡ m−(x) = −(1 − q) x ,

(8)

x ≡

dy y P +(y | x), and q is a parameter responsible for generating
where hyi+
the asymmetry in question, for which we will take a value of q = 0.154. In

for weights w± and parameters of the component distributions are ﬁxed by ﬁtting the

Fig. 5 we plot the full conditional distirbution P(y| x = 0.1) and its three
components using the weights w0 = 0.85, w+ = 0.015 and w− = 0.135.

A simple calculation shows that the mean conditional response corre-

sponding to Eq. (7) takes the following form:

hyix =

(w+(x) − w−(x)) + q (w+(x) + w−(x))

x

(9)

(cid:2)

2.3.1 Constant weights w±
It is instructive to start with the case of constant weights w±. From Eq. (9)
we see that in this case one gets a purely linear correlation between the
conditional mean response and the push. To analyze the two-dimensional
asymmetry pattern one has to specify the functional form of the distributions
P ±, 0(y| x). Let us assume that all three are Laplace distributions

(cid:8)

exp

with common width parameter σ. We choose w± = 0.075, q = 0.15 and
σ = $ 0.052. Using the consistency condition Eq. (3) we have checked that
the distribution (7) with constant weights w± indeed solves (3) so that we can
reconstruct the full two-dimensional distribution P(x, y) and its asymmetric
component P a. The resulting asymmetry pattern is shown in Fig. 4 (b).
We see that it has a characteristic market mill shape. We conclude that a
model based on the distribution (7) with constant weights w± does reproduce
the market mill asymmetry pattern but does not reproduce the nonlinear z-
shaped mean conditional response.

(cid:9)

2.3.2 Push-dependent weights w±(x)

The experimentally observed dependence does have a pronounced nonlinear
z-shaped form, see Fig. 1 and [2], so we have to correct our model in order to
reproduce it. In fact, to generate such nonlinear dependence it is suﬃcient
to consider the case of push-dependent weights w±(x). To reproduce the
z-shaped pattern of Fig. 1 we have to ensure a bias towards trend-following
behavior, (i.e positive slope of hyix vs the push) at small nonzero x and a bias
towards contrarian behavior (negative slope of hyix vs the push) at large x.

resulting mean conditional response to the market data corresponding to the time scale of
3 minutes.

7

The components of the conditional distribution Eq. (7) responsible for trend-
following and contrarian behavior are obviously P +(y| x) and P −(y| x) cor-
respondingly, so we have to choose some appropriate parametrization of the
weights w±. A simple illustration leading to the conditional mean response
shape qualitatively similar to that in Fig. 1 is provided by

w±(x) =

1 − w0
2

(1 ∓ | x|) =⇒ hyix = (1 − w0) x (q − | x|)

(11)

From Eq. (11) we see that the role of the parameter q is in ﬁxing the scale
at which the nonlinear mean conditional response hyix changes its sign.

To reproduce the shape of conditional mean response close to the observed
one, see Fig. 1, we shall use a somewhat more complex parametrization of
the weights w±(x):

w−(x) = min

1 − w0 − wa

w+(x) = 1 − w0 − w−(x)

, 1 − w0

(cid:19)

(12)

Choosing w0 = 0.85, wa = 0.05, q = 0.25, p = 0.5 and σ = $ 0.052 leads to
the above-introduced parametrization of conditional response in Eq. (5). The
resulting asymmetry pattern is plotted in Fig. 4 (c) and the push dependence
of the weights w±(x) is illustrated in Fig. 6. Let us note that such ﬁne details
of the structure of the asymmetry of the empirical distribution P(x, y) shown
in Fig. 2 as the shape of equiprobability lines and the varying form of mill
blades are, as seen in Fig. 4 (), reproduced by our model . Let us stress
that a bias towards trend-following behavior at small pushes and towards
contrarian behavior at large ones results from combination of x - dependent
weights and means.

Let us also emphasize that although it is formally possible to rewrite the
conditional dynamics described by the three-modal distribution with push-
dependent weights Eq. (7) in the form of Eq. (6) with some very intricate
noise distribution P(ε), this procedure looks extremely unnatural. In this
sense Eq. (7) presents a really diﬀerent view on conditional dynamics than
the conventional Eq. (6). The resulting asymmetry pattern is the same as in
the case of constant weights plotted in Fig. 6, so that the sought for market
mill structure is indeed reproduced.

Thus a model based on the conditional distribution (7) with specially
chosen push-dependent weights w±(x) allows to reproduce both nonlinear
the mean conditional response and the market mill asymmetry pattern.

8

The above-discussed procedure of reconstructing the bivariate distribu-
tion P(x, y) is by no means unique. Let us illustrate this by presenting
another model also based on the three-component ansatz for the conditional
distribution P(y| x). In this model the weights w± are the same as in Eq. (12)
and

m+(x) = x,

σ+(x) = 0.005 + 0.065

m0(x) = 0,

σ0 = 0.03

m−(x) = −x,

The resulting asymmetry pattern is shown in Fig. 4 (d).

Let us note that in Eqs. (12,13) the asymmetric dependence of the pa-
rameters of the component distributions is ”shifted” from the means m±(x)
to the widths σ±(x), cf. Eq. (8). All the results obtained using the model of
Eqs. (12,13) are similar to those obtained with Eqs. (8,12).

The models of Eqs. (8,12) and (12,13) are just two examples from a long
list of models that describe the market mill asymmetry with respect to the
axis y = 0 and the nonlinear mean conditional response. Our choice was
motivated by their transparent logical structure.

2.4 Relationship between nonlinear predictability and

market mill asymmetry

At this point it is appropriate to summarize the relationship between the
the phenomena of nonlinear predictability due to nontrivial push-dependent
mean conditional response and the market mill asymmetry pattern charac-
terizing the asymmetry of the bviariate distribution P(x, y) with respect to
the axis y = 0. Our considerations in the paragraphs 2.2 and 2.3 have shown
that this relationship is model - dependent. In particular:

• The single-component model of conditional dynamics of (4,5) describes
nonlinear predictability (i.e. z-shaped mean conditional response) but
gives a wrong asymmetry pattern of P(x, y). Thus the nonlinear mean
conditional response does not constitute a suﬃcient condition for the
existence of the market mill asymmetry.

9

• The multi-component model of (7,8) with constant weights w± de-
scribes the market mill asymmetry pattern but not the nonlinear de-
pendence of the mean conditional response on push. Thus the market
mill asymmetry does not constitute a suﬃcient condition for the exis-
tence of the nonlinear mean conditional response.

2.5 Market mill from the agent-based perspective

Let us now discuss the possible origins of the market mill asymmetry in the
framework of agent-based description of ﬁnancial market dynamics.

A direct link between the agent’s strategies and price evolution is provided
by the relation between the sign of market orders and the resulting change
in price, see e.g. [14]. In the discrete time formulation this corresponds to a
dependence of price increment δpt = p t+1 − pt on cumulative sum of signed
t placed at time t, where V ± is a volume of buy (+) and
orders Ωt = V +
sell (-) orders. With the simplest assumption of linear impact

t − V −

δp t =

Ωt .

1
λ

(14)

(15)

Assuming constant proportionality coeﬃcient λ, the probability distribution
of price increments is a rescaled version of the probability distribution of the
signed volume:

P(Ωt) −→ P(δp t)

The distribution P(Ωt) provides a probabilistic description of agent’s
strategies realized through buying (selling) a certain number of stocks or just
doing nothing at time t. Let us consider a simple case when such trading
decisions depend on the preceding price increment δp t−1, so that

P (δp t) =

P (Ωt| δp t−1) .

(16)

Within this framework it is natural to classify agents into three groups,
trend-following contrarian and noise, characterized by probability distribu-
tions P + (Ωt| δp t−1), P − (Ωt| δp t−1) and P 0 (Ωt| δp t−1) correspondingly. The
distributions P ±,0 (Ωt| δp t−1) are biased in such a way that
sign (E[ P ± (Ωt| δp t−1 )]) = ±sign (δp t−1)
and E [P ± (Ωt| δp t−1)] = 0. The trend-followers are betting that the sign
of the next price increment is on average the same as that of the previous

1
λ

10

one, the contrarians bet on sign reversal and noise traders make random
decisions. Generically the yields w±, 0 of the trend-following, contrarian and
noise strategies depend both on the sign and magnitude of δp t−1. Thus

P (Ωt| δp t−1) =

P i (Ωt| δp t−1)

(17)

i=+,−, 0
X
which is, due to (14), precisely the conditional distribution (7). Therefore
the three components of the conditional distribution P (Ωt| δp t−1) in Eq. (17)
(trend-following, contrarian and noise) precisely correspond to the three com-
ponents of the conditional distribution P(y| x) in Eq. (7).

2.6 Limitations of the model

In the present paper we have focused on building a probabilistic model de-
scribing the market mill asymmetry pattern corresponding to one particular
asymmetry of P(x, y), that of reﬂection y → −y. As shown in [2], the full
empirical bivariate distribution is in fact characterized by several asymmetry
patterns having the market mill shape, e.g. that corresponding to the reﬂec-
tion with respect to the axis y = x. We have checked that with the ansatz
Eq. (7) one can not reproduce the market mill pattern corresponding to this
last asymmetry. In fact, our ansatz is tailored to describe only one partic-
ular asymmetry, that of conditional response. Constructing a probabilistic
model describing the full asymmetry structure of P(x, y) remains a task for
the future.

Let us also note that even with the asymmetry pattern under consider-
ation the ansatz Eq. (7) does not allow to reproduce all details of the em-
pirically observed pattern. For example, if we introduce the dependence of
conditional standard deviation on the push, see [3], the market mill pattern
gets heavily distorted.

3 Conclusions

Let us summarize the main results obtained in the paper:

• A probabilistic model based on the multi-component model for condi-
tional distribution P(y|, x) reproducing the nonlinear z-shaped mean
conditional response and the market mill conditional response asym-
metry pattern was constructed.

11

• We demonstrated that a single-component model corresponding to con-
ventional noisy conditional dynamics with built-in z-shaped mean con-
ditional response does not allow to reproduce the market mill condi-
tional response asymmetry pattern, so that an existence of the z-shaped
mean conditional response does not imply that of the market mill asym-
metry pattern.

• Consideration of the case of push-independent weights in the multi-
component model conditional distribution P(y| x) showed that the mar-
ket mill asymmetry pattern can coexist with the usual linear depen-
dence of the mean conditional response on push, so that an existence of
the market mill asymmetry pattern does not imply that of the z-shaped
mean conditional response.

• A possible link of the discussed probabilistic model with agent-based

description of market dynamics was outlined.

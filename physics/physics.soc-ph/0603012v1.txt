The Process of price formation and
the skewness of asset returns

Abstract

Distributions of assets returns exhibit a slight skewness. In this note we show that our
model of endogenous price formation [4] creates an asymmetric return distribution if the
price dynamics are a process in which consecutive trading periods are dependent from
each other in the sense that opening prices equal closing prices of the former trading
period. The corresponding parameter α is estimated from daily prices from 01/01/1999
- 12/31/2004 for 9 large indices. For the S&P 500, the skewness distribution of all its
constituting assets is also calculated. The skewness distribution due to our model is
compared with the distribution of the empirical skewness values of the ingle assets.

Introduction

The existence of stylized facts suggests that price trails of diﬀerent ﬁnancial markets might
be regarded as diﬀerent realizations of a more general stochastic system, called ’The ﬁnancial
market’. If so then the question is about the nature of this system. Since prices are macro-
observables of a ﬁnancial market, the model about price dynamics is deﬁned on the macro
level. Due to the set of assumptions used in its derivation, this model is an approximation in
itself, see [4]. Three major properties estimated there were the distribution of (logarithmic)
asset returns, the spectrum of Hurst exponents of their time series, and ﬁnally two entropy
measures, the Renyi entropy and the Tsallis entropy. Although the model is a zero-order
approximation, theoretical results agree with real data. First-order corrections concerning
the set of assumptions made should improve these theoretical ﬁndings. An important feature
the ’old’ model was not able to capture is the (slight) skewness. In fact, if trading happens
along a sequence of independent trading periods, i.e. opening prices are independent from
closing price of the former trading period, the the distribution of returns is symmetric - in
contrary to empirical data.

In fact the assumption that opening prices are independent from closing prices is econom-
ically unreasonable. If each period is one day at an exchange, then there is night between
closing time and opening time. While on the one hand, many things can happen during the
night time, it is not reasonable that the next opening price is independent from the price
at the former closing time. In the contrary we assume that successive trading periods are
dependent from each in that the opening price of each period equals the closing price of its
former trading period.

To recapitulate the basic idea of our model: People go to the ﬁnancial market to ’let
their money work’. They do so by investing their money into assets. If the agent has capital
= mt
units of this asset for its price Xt. A unit
mt to invest in asset A, he can buy
Xt
of this asset has an uncertain value δt some time later1. Hence at this time, the money mt
invested in asset A has value Mt+1 = δt
mt. If the agent is lucky, then at the expiration
Xt
time δ

x > 1, and his money m has become more valuable by a factor

A

λt =

Mt+1
mt

=

δt
Xt

.

(1)

It is reasonable to assume that the agent wants to spend his money in an asset of which
he expects that δt
> 1. Thus, depending on his expectation about the future value of λt
Xt
the agents buys or sells this asset. Therefore, if the agent expects that λt > 1, he will buy,
otherwise he will sell. This causes an increase (decrease) of demand in this asset. Due to the
increase (decrease) of demand, the price will rise (fall). Thus the growth rate of the price
process is some function of the recently expected gain λ.

The physical time interval [0, t) is divided into intervals marking trading periods Tτ =
[τ, τ + 1), where [τ can be regarded as its opening time and τ + 1) as its closing time.
Considering daily prices, it might be suggestive to think that a trading period lasts for one
day, from the opening of the exchange to its closing. Two periods are then separated by
night time, in which no trade but a lot can happen.

[ 0, t ) = [ 0, 1) ⋆ [ 1, 2) ⋆ . . . ⋆ [ t

1, t)

−

Denoting the price by a function X, we say that Xt := X[t is the opening price of period
Tt, while X ′
t := Xt) is the closing price of this period. Trading periods can be dependent
or independent in the sense that, in the ﬁrst case, the closing price X ′
t equals the opening
price of the next period Xt+1. If periods are independent, the price evolution is an ensemble
property of a 1-period model deﬁned for a single period which arbitrary initial prices X, so
that the price process becomes ’quasi - stationary’. Otherwise price evolution is described
by a multiplicative process in time given by

1Some therefore like to write δt+1 for the corresponding adapted stochastic process.

Xt+1 = ϕ(λt) Xt.

where the growth rate ϕ(λ) is assumed to be an increasing function of λ. The model and
its analysis considered here is based on the following four assumptions:

1. The ﬁnancial market contains only 1 asset;

2. Trading periods are dependent;

3. Payoﬀs are uniformly distributed within a ﬁxed ﬁnite interval;

4. The growth rate ϕ is a power law with a constant scaling exponent α, i.e.

ϕ(λ) = λα = X −α,

α > 0.

(3)

As seen, compared with the model in in [4], the only diﬀerence is in assumption 2, i.e.
trading periods are no longer independent from each other. As we will see this will induce
asymmetry in the system.

1.1 α and asymmetry

α acts as a zooming factor in that, if α < 1, the growth rate gives highest weight to price
ﬂuctuations on a small level, while if α > 1, price ﬂuctuations on a high level are more
important. This is since ∂φ(X)

X α−1 and hence for Y > X,

∼

∂φ(Y ) > ∂φ(X)

iﬀ

α > 1.

Second, if α < 1, then negative returns are more probable than positive returns, and vice
versa: Recall that, given two successive prices X ′, X, the return Z = ln X
X yields Z = α ln δ
Consequently, ∂αZt = 1

α Z which is solved by

X

Z(α) = Z ln(α)

Therefore, if α < 1, negative returns Z(α) < 0 are more probable than positive returns.
Taking both arguments together this gives the following picture: Talking about expectations,
the parameter α can be regarded as a ’preference parameter’ in the sense that if α < 1 the
agent puts more weight on low level price ﬂuctuations. On the other hand, if α > 1 the agent
puts more weight on high level price ﬂuctuations. On the other hand α can be regarded as
= 1, there exists an asymmetry in the model, which then
an asymmetry parameter: If α
is reﬂected in the skewness of returns. In this sense, skewness - negative for α < 1 and
positive for α > 1, is a consequence of diﬀerently weighting price ﬂuctuations that happen
on diﬀerent levels.

2 A formal exercise

This argumentation can be made precise by considering price evolution as a process, i.e.
assuming that Xt+1 = X ′
t, in which using equations 1, 2, and 3, consecutive prices are
related by

Xt+1 = δα

t X 1−α

negative skewness while α > 1 corresponds to positive skewness. This is in contratst to the
case where trading periods all independent, since there the distribution is symmetric for all

2.1 Estimating α from data

Given our model, one would like to estimate the parameter α from data. The obvious
method is to compare the distributions of positive and negative returns: Since α+ = 1

and α− = α, this would give

−

α = 1 + (α+ −

3 The proﬁle of an index

An index K is constituted by a number of selected assets iK. Therefore an index should
be characterized by the distribution of skewness values of its constituting assets rather than
by a single skewness value. For the range see table 2. As seen from Table 2, all indices
contain assets whose skewness’ varies from positive to negative values. There is actually
one exception which is the DAX. It should be further noted that the Hang Seng and the
Nasdaq contain assets with very high skewness. For them our low order approximation
becomes poor, of course.

4 Conclusion

The aim is understand basic principles of price formation on a ﬁnancial market in terms
of a simple model. While the mechanism proposed might seem to be plausible, only the
comparison with real data can judge about the feasibility of this model.

In [4] we proposed a simple model for endogenous price formation on the macro level.
This model and its analysis was based on a series of assumptions. This made the model a
Zero-order approximation. Comparison with real data showed that the proposed model did
already a good job. On the other hand, its limitations were clearly seen, as outlined in [4].
The logically next step was to modify the made assumptions step for step to see whether the
model is enhanced. One important feature, the previous model was not able to reproduce,
was the (slight) skewness of the distribution of asset returns seen in empirical data. Our
previous analysis was concerned with the setting that all trading periods are independent
from each other. In this case the return distribution was always symmetric. The analysis
was based on the assumption that trading periods were independent from each other. The
assumption that successive trading periods are independent from each other was not reason-
able: Opening prices are not independent from closing price of the former trading period.
Thus we substituted our initial assumption that trading periods are independent by the
assumption that the opening price equals the closing price of the former period. Thus price
evolution now became a process in time. The analysis in this note shows that, if the trading
periods are dependent from each other, the return distribution is skew. The only parameter
α of our model can be regarded as an asymmetry parameter. If α < 1, the distribution is
negatively skewed, while if α > 1, it is positively skewed. Only for α = 1, the distribution
is symmetric.

In economic terms α can be given other interpretation. Following ??, the parameter

The right picture is the central part of the right one.

α might de understood as the long-term averaged liquidity of an asset. The discussion in
section 1.1 additionally suggests an interpretation in term of preferences. The decision to
buy or to sell the asset depends on the agents ’believe’ about the future growth rate of the
value of the asset. This depends on both, the recent price level and the ﬂuctuations on this
level. As the discussion in section 1.1 shows, if α < 1, then the agent puts more weight on
price ﬂuctuations on a low level, while otherwise, price ﬂuctuations on a high level are more
important. This induces an asymmetry due to deviations of α from 1. This interpretation
implies that the skewness of empirical asset returns are due to an asymmetric preference in
the agents decision.

The next question was how much of the observed skewness of a empirical return distri-
bution can be ’explained’ as a consequence of considering trading as process? We therefore
estimated the skewness parameter α from data and calculated the skewness that our model
would generate given this parameter. This ’theoretical’ skewness was then compared with
the empirical skewness in the data. It turned out that a huge amount of empirical skewness
is quite well described by our model, in which the price dynamics are a process!

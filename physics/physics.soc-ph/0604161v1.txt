I. ABSTRACT

Pareto’s law:

A class of conserved models of wealth distributions are
studied where wealth (or money) is assumed to be ex-
changed between a pair of agents in a population just
like the elastically colliding molecules of a gas exchanging
energy. All sorts of distributions from Boltzmann-Gibbs
type exponential one to something like Gamma distribu-
tions and Pareto’s law like power laws are obtained out
of such models with simple algorithmic exchange pro-
cesses. Numerical inevstigations, analysis through tran-
sition matrix and a mean ﬁeld approach are employed to
understand the generative mechanisms. A general sce-
nario is examined wherefrom a power law and other dis-
tributions can emerge.

INTRODUCTION

Wealth is accumulated in various forms and factors.
The continual exchange of wealth (a value assigned)
among the agents in an economy gives rise to interesting
and many often universal statistical distributions of in-
dividual wealth. Here the word ‘wealth’ is used in a gen-
eral sense for the purpose and the spirit of the review (in-
spite of separate meanings attached to the terms ‘money’,
‘wealth’ and ‘income’). Econophysics of wealth distribu-
tions [1] is an emerging area where mainly the ideas and
techniques of statistical physics are used in interpreting
real economic data of wealth (mostly in terms of income)
of all kinds of people or other entities (e.g., companies)
for that matter, pertaining to diﬀerent societies and na-
tions. Literature in this area is growing steadily (see an
excellent website [3]). The prevalence of income data and
apparent interconnections of many socio-economic prob-
lems with physics have inspired a wide variety of sta-
tistical models, data analysis and other works in econo-
physics [4], sociophysics and other emerging areas [5] in
the last one decade or more (see an enjoyable article by
Stauﬀer[2]).

Simple approach of agent based models have been able
to bring out all kinds of wealth distributions that open
up a whole new way of understanding and interpreting
empirical data. One of the most important and contro-
versial issues has been to understand the emergence of

w

≥

P (w)

−α,
where w
w0, w0 being some value of wealth beyond
which the power law is observed (usually towards the
tail of the distributions). Pareto’s law has been observed
in income distributions among the people of almost all
kinds of social systems across the world in a robust way.
This phenomenon is now known for more than a century
old and has been discussed at a great length in innumer-
able works in economics, econophysics and physics deal-
ing with power laws. In many places, while mentioning
Pareto’s law, the power law is often written in the form:
w−(1+ν), where ν is referred to as ‘Pareto index’.
P (w)
This index is usually found between 1 and 2 from empir-
ical data ﬁtting. Power laws appear in many other cases
[11, 25, 26] like the computer ﬁle sizes, the growth of sizes
of business ﬁrms and cities etc. Distributions are often
referred to as ‘heavy tailed’ or ‘fat tailed’ distributions
[7]. Smaller the value of α, fatter the tail of the distri-
bution as it may easily be understood (the distribution
is more spread out).

∝

Some early attempts [6] have been made to understand
the income distributions which follow Pareto’s law at the
tail of the distributions. Some of them are stochastic lo-
gistic equations or some related generalized versions of
that which have been able to generate power laws. How-
ever, the absence of direct interactions of one agent with
other often carries less signiﬁcance in terms of interpret-
ing real data.

Some part of this review is centered around the concept
of emergence of Pareto’s law like power law in the distri-
butions, especially in the context of the models discussed
here. However, a word of caution is in order. In the cur-
rent literature and as well as in the historical occurrences,
the power law distribution has often been disputed with
a closely related lognormal distribution [11]. It is often
not easy to distinguish between the two. Thus a brief
discussion is made here on this issue. Let us consider the
probability density function of a lognormal distribution:

p(w) =

exp[

ln(w

w)2/2σ2],

(2)

−

−

√2πσw

The logarithm of the above can be written as:

ln p(w) =

ln w

ln √2πσ

−

−

ln(w

.

−

−

(3)

If now the variance σ2 in the lognormal distribution is
large enough, the last term on the right hand side can
be very small so that the distribution may appear linear
on a log-log plot. Thus the cause of concern remains,
particularly when one deals with real data.

In the literature, sometimes one calculates a cumula-
tive distribution function (to show the power law in a
more convincing way) instead of plotting ordinary distri-
bution from simple histogram (probability density func-
tion). The cumulative probability distribution function
P (
w) is such that the argument has a value greater
than or equal to w:

When the ordinary distribution (found from just his-
togram and binning) is a power law, the cumulative dis-
tribution thus also follows a power law with the exponent
1 less: α
1, which can be seen from a log-log plot of
data. An extensive discussion on power laws and related
matters can be found in [25].

−

Besides power laws, a wide variety of wealth distri-
butions from exponential to something like Gamma dis-
tributions are all reported in recent literature in Econo-
physics. Exchange of wealth is considered to be the pri-
mary mechanism behind all such distributions. In a class
of wealth exchange models [12, 13, 14, 15] that follow, the
economic activities have been assumed to be analogous
to random elastic collisions among molecules as consid-
ered in kinetic gas theory in statistical physics. Analogy
is drawn between wealth (w) and Energy (E), where the
average invidual wealth (w) at equilibrium is equivalent
to temperature (T ). Wealth (w) is assumed to be ex-
changed between two randomly selected economic agents
like the exchange of energy between a pair of molecules
in Kinetic theory. The interaction is such that one agent
wins and the other loses the same amount so that the
sum of their wealth remains constant before and after an
interaction (trading): wi(t+1)+wj(t+1) = wi(t)+wj (t);
each trading increases time t by one unit. Therefore, it is
basically a process of zero sum exchange between a pair of
agents; amount won by one agent is equal to the amount
lost by another. This way wealth is assumed to be re-
distributed among a ﬁxed number of agents (N ) and the
wi)
local conservation ensures the total wealth (W =
of all the agents remains conserved. Random exchange of
wealth between a randomly selected pair of agents may
be viewed as a gambling process (with zero sum exchange)
which leads to Boltzmann-Gibbs type exponential distri-
bution in individual wealth (P (w)
w/w). How-
ever, a little variation in the mode of wealth exchange

exp(

P

−

can lead to a distribution distinctly diﬀerent from ex-
ponential. A number of agent based conserved models
[8, 9, 10, 15, 18, 20, 24, 29], invoked in recent times,
are essentially variants of gambling process. A wide va-
riety of distributions evolve out of these models. There
has been a renewed interest in such two-agent exchange
models in the present scenario while dealing various prob-
lems in social systems with complex interactions. A good
insight can be drawn by looking at the 2
2 transition
matrix involved with the process of wealth exchange [19].
In this review the aim would be to arrive at some un-
derstanding of how wealth exchange processes in a sim-
ple working way may lead to a variety of distributions
within the framework of the conserved models A ﬁxed
number of N agents in a system are allowed to interact
(trade) stochastically and thus wealth is exchanged be-
tween them. The basic steps of such a wealth exchange
model are as follows:

×

wi(t + 1) = wi(t) + ∆w,

(6)

wj (t + 1) = wj (t)

∆w,

−

where wi(t) and wj (t) are wealths of i-th and j-th agents
at time t and wi(t + 1) and wj (t + 1) are that at the next
time step (t + 1) after a single interaction. The amount
∆w (to be won or to be lost by an agent) is determined
by the nature of interaction. If the agents are allowed to
interact for a long enough time, the steady state equilib-
rium distribution for individual wealth is achieved. An
equilibrium distribution does not depend on the initial
conﬁguration (initial distribution of wealth among the
agents). A single interaction between a randomly chosen
pair of agents is referred here as one ‘time step’. In some
simulations, N such interactions are considered as one
time step. This, however, does not matter as long as the
system is evolved through enough time steps to come to
a steady state and then data is collected for making equi-
librium probability distributions. For all the numerical
results presented here, data have been produced following
the available models, conjectures and conclusions. Sys-
tems of N = 1000 agents have been considered in each
case. In each numerical investigation, the system is al-
lowed to equilibrate for a suﬃcient time that ranges be-
tween 105 to 108 time steps. Conﬁguration averaging has
been done over 103 to 105 initial conﬁgurations in most
cases. The average wealth (averaged over the agents) is
kept ﬁxed at w = 1 (by taking total wealth, W = N )
for all the cases. The wealth distributions that are dealt
here in this review are ordinary distributions (probability
density function) and not the cumulative ones.

III. PURE GAMBLING

In a pure gambling process (usual Kinetic Theory),
entire sum of wealths of two agents is up for gambling.

Some random fraction of this sum is shared by one agent
and the rest goes to the other. The randomness or
stochasticity is introduced into the model through a pa-
rameter ǫ which is a random number drawn from a uni-
form distribution in [0, 1]. (ǫ is independent of a pair of
agents i.e., a pair of agents is not likely to share the same
fraction of aggregate wealth the same way when the meet
repeatedly). The interaction can be seen through:

wi(t + 1) = ǫ[wi(t) + wj (t)],

(7)

wj(t + 1) = (1

ǫ)[wi(t) + wj(t)],

−

−

where the pair of agents i and j are chosen randomly. The
amount of wealth that is exchanged is ∆w = ǫ[wi(t) +
wj(t)]
wi(t). The individual wealth distribution (P (w)
vs. w) at equilibrium emerges out to be Boltzmann-
Gibbs distribution like exponential. Exponential distri-
bution of personal income has in fact been shown to ap-
pear in real data [13, 14]. In the kinetic theory model,
the exponential distribution is found by standard formu-
lation of master equation or by entropy maximization
method, the latter has been discussed later in brief in
section VIII. The exponential normalized distribution is
shown in Fig. 1 in semi logarithmic plot. The data is
obtained numerically. The high end of the distribution
appears noisy due to sampling of data. The successive
bins on the right hand side of the graph contain less and
less number of samples in them so the fractional counts in
them are seen to ﬂuctuate more (ﬁnite size eﬀect). One
way to get rid of this sampling error in a great extent is
by way of taking logarithmic binning [25]. Here it is not
important to do so as the idea is to show the nature of
the curve only. (In the case of power law distribution, an
even better way to demonstrate and extract the power
law exponent is to plot the cumulative distribution as
discussed already.)

If one intends to take time average of wealth of a sin-
gle agent over a suﬃciently long time, it comes out to
be equal for all the agents. Therefore, the distribution
of individual time averaged wealth turns out to be a delta
function which is checked from numerical data. This is
because the ﬂuctuation of wealth of any agent over time
is statistically no diﬀerent from that of any other. The
same is true in case of the distribution of wealth of a
single agent over time. However, when the average of
wealth for any agent is calculated over a short time pe-
riod, the delta function broadens and the right end part
of which decays exponentially. The distribution of indi-
vidual wealth at a certain time turns out to be purely
exponential as mentioned earlier. This may be thought
of as a ‘snap shot’ distribution.

IV. UNIFORM SAVING PROPENSITY

Instead of random sharing of their aggregate wealth
during each interaction, if the agents decide to save (keep
aside) a uniform (and ﬁxed) fraction (λ) of their current
individual wealth, then the wealth exchange equations
look like the following:

−
ǫ)(1

wi(t + 1) = λwi(t) + ǫ(1

λ)[wi(t) + wj(t)],

(8)

wj(t + 1) = λwj(t) + (1

λ)[wi(t) + wj(t)],

−

λ)[wi(t) + wj (t)].

where the amount of wealth that is exchanged is ∆w =
(ǫ
Introduction of the con-
cept of saving introduced by Chakrabarti and group [15]
in an otherwise gambling kind of interactions brings out
distinctly diﬀerent distributions. A numer of numerical
works followed [16, 17, 22] in order to understand the
emerging distributions to some extent. Saving induces
accumulation of wealth. Therefore, it is expected that
the probability of ﬁnding agents with zero wealth can be
zero unlike in the previous case of pure gambling where
due to the unguarded nature of exchange many agents are
likely to go nearly bankrupt! (It is to be noted that for
an exponential distribution, the peak is at zero.) In this
case the most probable value of the distribution (peak)
is somewhere else than at zero (the distribution is rightly
right skewed). The right end, however, decays exponen-
tially for large values of w. It has been claimed through
heuristic arguments (based on numerical results) that the
distribution is a close approximate form of the Gamma
distribution[16]:

P (w) =

wn−1e

−nw,

nn
Γ(n)

where the Gamma function Γ(n) and the index n are un-
derstood to be related to the saving propensity parameter
λ through the following relation:

(9)

(10)

n = 1 +

−

.

λ

The emergence of probable Gamma distribution is also
subsequently supported through numerical results in [17].
However, it has later been shown in [23] by considering
moments’ equation that moments up to third order agree
with that obtained from the above form of distribution
subject to the condition stated in eqn. (10). Discrepan-
cies start showing only from 4th order onwards. There-
fore, the actual form of distribution still remains an open
question.

In Fig. 2, two distributions are shown for two diﬀerent
values of saving propensity factor: λ = 0.4 and λ = 0.8.
Smaller the value of λ, lesser the amount one is able to
save. This in turn means more wealth is available in the
market for gambling. In the limit of zero saving (λ = 0)
the model reduces to that of pure gambling model. In
the opposite extent of large saving only a small amount
of wealth is up for gambling. Then the exchange of wealth
will not be able to drastically change the amount of in-
dividual wealth. This means the width of distribution of
individual wealth will be narrow. In the limit of λ = 1,
all the agents save all of their wealth and thus the distri-
bution never evolves. The concept of ‘saving’ here is of
course a little diﬀerent from that in real life where people
do save some amount to be kept in a bank or so and the
investment (or business or gambling) is done generally
not with the entire amount (or a fraction) of wealth that
one holds at a time.

Stochastic evolution of individual wealth is also exam-
ined without the inclusion of stochastic parameter ǫ. The
stochasticity seems to be automatically introduced any-
how through the random selection of a pair of agents (and
the random choice of the winner or loser as well) at each
time. Therefore, it is interesting to see how the distribu-
tions evolve with a ﬁxed value of ǫ. As an example, the
equations in (8) reduce to the following with ǫ = 1:

wi(t + 1) = wi(t) + (1

λ)wj (t),

(11)

−

wj(t + 1) = λwj (t).

The above equations indicate that the randomly selected
agent j keeps (saves) an amount λwj (t) proportional to
the wealth he currently has and transfers the rest to the
other agent i. This is indeed a stochastic process and
is able to produce Gamma type distributions in wealth
as observed. However, a distribution with random ǫ and
that with a ﬁxed ǫ are deﬁnitely diﬀerent. Numerically,
it has been observed, the distribution with λ = 0.8 and
with a ﬁxed value of ǫ = 1 is very close to that with
λ = 0.5 and with random ǫ. In Fig. 2 the distribution
with ﬁxed λ = 0.8 and ﬁxed ǫ = 1 is plotted along with
other two distributions with random ǫ. It should also be
noted that while with ﬁxed ǫ, one does not get Gamma
type distributions for all values of λ; especially for low
values of λ the distributions become close to exponential
as observed. The reason for this is not very clear though.
Recently it has been brought to notice in [33] that a
very similar kind of agent based model was proposed by

FIG. 2: Wealth distribution for the model of uniform and

λ = 0.4 and λ = 0.8 where the stochasticity parameter ǫ is
drawn randomly and uniformly in [0, 1]. Another distribution
is plotted with λ = 0.8 but with ﬁxed value of the stochasticity
parameter, ǫ = 1.

Angle [34] (see other references cited in [33]) in sociolog-
ical journals quite some years ago. The pair of equations
in Angle’s model are as follows:

wi(t + 1) = wi(t) + Dtωwj(t)

where ω is a ﬁxed fraction and the winner is decided
through a random toss Dt which takes a value either 0 or
1. Now, the above can be seen as the more formal way of
writing the pair of equations (11) which can be arrived
at by choosing Dt = 1 and identifying ω = (1

λ).

It can in general be said, within the framework of this
kind of (conserved) models, diﬀerent ways of incorpo-
rating wealth exchange may lead to drastically diﬀerent
kinds of distributions. If the gamble is played in a biased
way, then this may lead to a distinctly diﬀerent situa-
tion than the case when it is played in a normal unbiased
manner. Since in this class of models negative wealth or
debt is not allowed, it is desirable that in each wealth ex-
change, the maximum that any agent may invest is the
amount that he has at that time. Suppose, the norm
is set for an ‘equal amount invest’ where the amount to
be deposited by an agent for gambling is decided by the
amount the poorer agent can aﬀord and then the same
amount is agreed to be deposited by the richer agent.
Let us suppose wi > wj. Now, the poorer agent (j) may
invest a certain fraction of his wealth, an amount λwj
and the rest (1
λ)wj is saved by him. Then the total
amount 2λwj is up for gambling and as usual a fraction of
this, 2ǫλwj may be shared by the richer agent i where the
rest (1
ǫ)λwj goes to the poorer agent j. This may ap-
pear ﬁne, however, this leads to ‘rich gets richer and poor

−

−

gets poorer’ way. The richer agent draws more and more
wealth in his favour in the successive encounters and the
poorer agents are only able to save less and less and ﬁ-
nally there is a condensation of wealth at the hands of the
richest person. This is more apparent when one considers
an agent with λ = 1 where it can be easily checked that
the richer agent automatically saves an amount equal to
wj ) and the poorer
the diﬀerence of their wealth (wi −
agent ends up saving zero amount. Eventually, poorer
agents get extinct. This is ‘minimum exchange model’
[29].

V. DISTRIBUTED SAVING PROPENSITY

A distinctly diﬀerent distribution emerges when the
saving propensity factor (λ) is drawn from a uniform and
random distribution in [0,1] as introduced in a model
proposed by Chakrabarti and chatterjee [8]. Randomness
in λ is assumed to be quenched (i.e., remains unaltered in
time). Agents are indeed heterogeneous. They are likely
to have diﬀerent (characteristic) saving propensities. The
pair of wealth exchange equations are now written as:

wi(t+1) = λiwi(t)+ǫ[(1

λi)wi(t)+(1

λj)wj(t))], (13)

−

−

wj(t+1) = λj wj(t)+(1

ǫ)[(1

λi)wi(t)+(1

λj)wj(t))].

−

−

−

The distribution in λ is assumed to be quenched. A
power law with exponent α = 2 (Pareto index ν = 1)
is observed at the right end of the wealth distribution for
several decades. Such a distribution is plotted in Fig. 3
where a straight line is drawn in the log-log plot with
slope = -2 to illustrate the power law and the exponent.
Extensive numerical results with diﬀerent distributions in
the saving propensity parameter λ are reported in [18].
The Pareto index thus obtained, however, diﬀers from
what is generally extracted (1.5 or above) from most of
the empirical data of income distributions (see discus-
sions and analysis on real data by various authors in [1]).
The present model is not able to resolve this discrepancy
and it is not expected at the outset either. The simple
approach of incorporating the concept of distributed and
quenched saving propensities among a population, that
brings out a power law in wealth distribution, is itself an
interesting point. There have been attempts to modify
the model by introducing random waiting time in the in-
teractions of agents in order to have a justiﬁcation for a
larger value of the exponent ν [36].

The distributed saving gives rise to an interesting fea-
ture in a special case when the saving parameter λ is con-
sidered to have only two ﬁxed values, λ1 and λ2 (prefer-
ably widely separated). A bimodal distribution in indi-
vidual wealth results in [19]. This can be seen from the
Fig. 4. The system evolves towards a robust and distinct
two-peak distribution as the diﬀerence in λ1 and λ2 is
increased systematically. Later it is seen that one still

gets two-peak distributions even when λ1 and λ2 (one
very high and the other very low), are drawn from nar-
row distributions around their ﬁxed and widely separated
values. Thus two economic classes seem to persist until
the distributions in λ1 and λ2 have got suﬃcient widths.
A population can be imagined to have two distinctly dif-
ferent kinds of people: some of them tend to save a very
large fraction (ﬁxed) of their wealth and the others tend
to save a relatively small fraction (ﬁxed) of their wealth.
Bimodal distribution (and a polymodal distribution, in
general) is reported with real data for the income distri-
butions in Argentina [39]. The distributions were derived
at a time of political crisis and thus they may not be re-
garded as equilibrium distributions though. However, it
remains an interesting possibility out of a simple model
of wealth exchange.

A. Power law from Mean ﬁeld Analysis

Wealth of each individual keeps on changing due to
such interactions (or wealth exchange processes that take
place in a society). No matter what the personal wealth
one begins with, the time evolution of wealth of an in-
dividual agent at the steady state is independent of that
initial value. This means the distribution of wealth of
any agent over time is stationary. Therefore, the time
averaged value of wealth of any agent remains unchanged
whatever the amount of wealth one starts with. In course
of time an agent interacts with all other agents (presum-
ably repeatedly) given suﬃcient time. One can thus think
of a number of conﬁgurations (ensembles) and focus at-
tention on a particular tagged agent who eventually tends
to interact with all other agents in diﬀerent ensembles.
Thus the time averaged value of wealth is equal to the
ensemble averaged value in the steady state.

One can have an estimate of ensemble averaged value
of wealth [21] using one of the above equations 13 in
section V. Taking ensemble average of all the terms on
both sides of the ﬁrst eqn. 13, one may write:

6

where one can get rid of the index i and may write
= w for brevity. The above relation is also veri-
wii
h
ﬁed numerically which is obtained by many authors in
their numerical simulations and scaling of data [17, 18].
One can now derive dw = w
C dλ from the above relation
(17). An agent with a (characteristic) saving propensity
factor (λ) ends up with wealth (w) such that one can in
general relate the distributions of the two:

2

P (w)dw = g(λ)dλ.

(18)

If now the distribution in λ is considered to be uniform
and random then g(λ) = constant. Therefore, the distri-
bution in w is bound to be of the form:

p(w)

1
w2 .

∝

(19)

This may be regarded as Pareto’s law with index α = 2
which is already numerically veriﬁed. The result is also
obtained recently in [27] where the treatment is argued
to be exact.

(with the same exponent, α = 2) for any ﬁxed value of
ǫ. As an example, the case for ǫ = 1 is considered. The
pair of exchange relations now reduce to the following:

The right hand side is now independent of any agent-
index and the left hand side is referred to any arbitrarily

any agent (for any value of the index i) and thus it can
be equated to a constant. Let us now recognize C =

over ensembles. Thus one arrives at a unique relation for

drawn from a uniform and random distribution in [0, 1],
then η is also uniformly and randomly distributed in [0,
1]. To achieve a power law in the wealth distribution it is
essential that randomness in η has to be quenched. For
‘annealed’ type disorder (i.e., when the distribution in η
varies with time) the power law gets washed away (which
is observed through numerical simulations). It has also
been observed that power law can be obtained only when
η is uniformly distributed between 0 and some value less
than or equal to 1. As an example, η is taken in the
range between 0 and 0.5, a power law is obtained with
the same exponent α = 2. However, when η is taken in
the range 0.5 < η < 1, the distribution clearly deviates
from power law which is evident from the log-log plot in
Fig. 5. Thus there seems to be a crossover from power

law to some distribution with exponentially decaying tail
as one tunes the range in the quenched parameter η.

At this point, two important criteria may be identiﬁed

for achieving power law within this reduced situation:

•

The disorder in the controlling parameter η has to
be quenched (ﬁxed set of ηi’s for a conﬁguration of
agents),

•

It is required that η has to be drawn from a uniform
distribution whose lower bound should be 0.

The above criteria may appear ad hoc, neverthelss have
been checked by extensive numerical investigations.
It
is further checked that the power law exponent does not
depend on the width of the distribution in η (as long as
it is between 0 and something less than 1). This claim
is substantiated by taking various ranges of η in which
it is uniformly distributed. Systematic investigations are
made for the cases where η is in [0, 0.2], [0, 0.4], . . . ,[0,
1]. Power laws result in in all the cases with the same
exponent α = 2.

VI. UNDERSTANDING THROUGH
TRANSITION MATRIX

The evolution of wealth in the kind of two-agent wealth
exchange process can be described through the following
2

(in section III) is thus the following:

In this case the above matrix is singular (determinant,
= 0) which means the inverse of this matrix does

not exit. This indicates that the evolution through such
transition matrices is bound to be irreversible. This
property is connected to the emergence of exponential
(Boltzmann-Gibbs) wealth distribution. The same may
be perceived in a diﬀerent way too. When a product of
such matrices (for successive interactions) are taken, the
left most matrix (of the product) itself returns:

The above signiﬁes the fact that during the repeated in-
teractions of the same two agents (via this kind of tran-
sition matrices), the last of the interactions is what mat-
ters (the last matrix of the product survives) [T (n).T (n
−
1) . . . T (2).T (1) = T (1)]. This ‘loss of memory’ (ran-
dom history of collisions in case of molecules) may be
attributed here to the path to irreversibility in time.

The singularity can be avoided if one considers the

generalized general form:

T1 =

(cid:18)

ǫ1 1

ǫ1

−

ǫ2

−

,

ǫ2 (cid:19)

ǫ2 6

where ǫ1 and ǫ2 may be two uniform and random num-
bers drawn separately between 0 and 1 (determinant
= 0, in general). The signiﬁcance of this
T1 = ǫ1 −
general form can be seen through the wealth exchange
equations in the following way: the ǫ1 fraction of wealth
of the 1st agent (i) added with ǫ2 fraction of wealth of the
2nd agent (j) is retained by the 1st agent after the trade.
The rest of their total wealth is shared by the 2nd agent.
This may happen in a number of ways which is depen-
dent on the detail considerations of a model. The general
= ǫ2 and then the
matrix T1 is nonsingular as long as ǫ1 6
two-agent interaction process remains reversible in time.
Therefore, it is expected to have an equilibrium distribu-
tion of wealth which may deviate from exponential distri-
bution (as in the case with pure gambling model). When
one considers ǫ1 = ǫ2, one again gets back the pure expo-
nential distribution. A trivial case is obtained for ǫ1 = 1
and ǫ2 = 0. The transition matrix then reduces to the

identity matrix I =

which trivially corresponds

1 0
0 1 (cid:19)

(cid:18)

to no interaction and no evolution.

It may be emphasized that any transition matrix
t11 t12
t21 t22 (cid:19)

(cid:18)
of the form such that the sum of two elements of either
of the columns has to be unity by design: t11 + t21 = 1,

, for such conserved models is bound to be

t12 + t22 = 1. It is important to note that whatever ex-
tra parameter, no matter, one includes in the model the
transition matrix has to retain this property.

In Fig. 6 three distributions (ǫ1 6

= ǫ2) are plotted with
diﬀerent ranges of ǫ1 and ǫ2 in support of the above dis-
cussions.
ǫ1 and ǫ2 are drawn from uniform and ran-
dom distributions in diﬀerent ranges to demonstrate that
qualitatively diﬀerent distributions are possible as the pa-
rameters are tuned appropriately.

FIG. 6: Three normalized wealth distributions are shown cor-
responding to the general matrix T2 (in general with ǫ1 6= ǫ2)
as discussed in the text. Curves are marked by numbers (1, 2
and 3) and the ranges of ǫ1 and ǫ2 are indicated within which
they are drawn uniformly and randomly.

Now let us compare the above situation with the model
of equal saving propensity as discussed in section IV.
With the incorporation of saving propensity factor λ, the
transition matrix now looks like:

Thus the matrix T2 is of the same form as T1. The dis-
tributions due to above two matrices of the same general
form can now be compared to that obtained from the
model if one can correctly identify the ranges of rescaled
elements. In the model with uniform saving: λ < ˜ǫ1 < 1
and 0 < ˜ǫ2 < (1
λ) as the stochasticity parameter ǫ is
is drawn from a uniform and random distribution in [0,
1]. As long as ˜ǫ1 and ˜ǫ2 are diﬀerent, the determinant
(
˜ǫ2 = λ) of the matrix is nonzero. Therefore,
= ˜ǫ1 −
T2|
|
the incorporation of the saving propensity factor λ brings
two eﬀects:

−

8

•

•

The transition matrix becomes non-singular,

The matrix elements t11 (= ˜ǫ1) and t12 (= ˜ǫ2) are
now drawn from truncated domains (somewhere in
[0, 1]).

Hence it is clear from the above discussion that the
wealth distribution with uniform saving is likely to be
qualitatively no diﬀerent from what can be achieved with
general transition matrices having diﬀerent elements,
= ǫ2. The distributions obtained with diﬀerent λ nat-
ǫ1 6
urally corresponds to appropriately chosen ǫ1 and ǫ2 in
T1.

In the next stage, when the saving propensity factor
λ is distributed as in section V, the transition matrix
between any two agents having diﬀerent λ’s (say, λ1 and
λ2) now looks like:

λ1 + ǫ(1
ǫ)(1

Again the elements of the above matrix can be rescaled
by putting ˜ǫ′
λ2). Hence
the transition matrix can again be reduced to the same
form as that of T1 or T2:

1 = λ1 + ǫ(1

λ1) and ˜ǫ′

ǫ) + ǫλ2.
The determinant here is
T3|
|
Here also the determinant is ensured to be nonzero as all
the parameters ǫ, λ1 and λ2 are drawn from the same
range: [0, 1]. This means that each transition matrix for
two-agent wealth exchange remains non-singular which
ensures the interaction process to be reversible in time.
The domains from which the rescaled elements in matrix
T3 are drawn are now truncated as can be easily checked.
Therefore, it may be apparent that qualitatively diﬀerent
distributions are possible when one appropriately tunes
the two elements ǫ1 and ǫ2 in the general form of tran-
sition matrix T1 (or T2 or T3). However, the emergence
of power law tail (Pareto’s law) in the distribution can
not be explained in this way. Later it is examined that
to obtain a power law in the framework of present mod-
els, it is essential that the distribution in λ has to be
quenched (frozen in time) which means the matrix ele-
ments in the general form of any transition matrix have
to be quenched. In the section V B, it has been shown
that the model of distributed saving (section V) is equiv-
alent to a reduced situation where one needs only one
variable η. The corresponding Transition matrix now
looks simpler:

A. Distributions from Generic Situation

From all the previous discussions, it is clear that the
the transition matrix (for zero sum wealth exchange) is
bound to be of the following general form:

(cid:18)

1

ǫ1 1

ǫ2 (cid:19)

.

ǫ1

−

ǫ2

−

The matrix elements, ǫ1 and ǫ2 can be appropriately as-
sociated with the relevant parameters in a model. A
generic situation arrives where one can generate all sorts
of distributions by controlling ǫ1 and ǫ2.

As long as ǫ1 6

= ǫ2, the matrix remains nonsignular
and one achieves Gamma type distributions. In a spe-
cial case, when ǫ1 = ǫ2, the transition matrix becomes
singular and Boltzmann-Gibbs type exponential distri-
bution results in. It has been numerically checked that
Pareto’s law like power laws with exponent α = 2 are
achieved with the general matrix when the elements ǫ1
and ǫ2 are the same set of quenched random numbers
drawn uniformly in [0, 1]. The matrix in the section V B
is just a special case with ǫ1 = 1 and ǫ2 = η, drawn
from a uniform and (quenched) random distribution. In-
corporation of any parameter in an actual model (sav-
ing propensity, for example) results in the adjustment or
truncation of the full domain [0, 1] from which the ele-
ment ǫ1 or ǫ2 is drawn. Incorporating distributed λ’s in
section V is equivalent to considering the following do-
mains: λ1 < ǫ1 < 1 and 0 < ǫ2 < (1

λ2).

and ǫ(2)
2

The most general situation is when the matrix elements
ǫ1 and ǫ2 are drawn separately (one may identify them
as ǫ(1)
to distinguish) from two uniform and
1
random distributions in the domains: 0 < ǫ1 < 1 and
0 < ǫ2 < 1. A power law is obtained with the expo-
nent α = 3 which is, however, distinctly diﬀerent from
that obtained from ‘distributed saving model’ in section
V. To test the robustness of power law, the distributions
in the matrix elements are taken in the following trun-
cated ranges: 0.5 < ǫ1 < 1 and 0 < ǫ2 < 0.5 (widths are
narrowed down). A power law is still obtained with the
same exponent (α close to 3). These results are plotted
in Fig. 7.

−

It is possible to achieve distributions other than power
laws as one draws the matrix elements, ǫ1 and ǫ2 from dif-
ferent domains within the range between 0 and 1. There
is indeed a crossover from power law to Gamma like dis-
tributions as one tunes the elements. It appears from ex-
tensive numerical simulations that power law disappears
when both the parameters are taken in some ranges that
do not include the lower limit 0. For example, when it is
considered, 0.8 < ǫ1 < 1.0 and 0.2 < ǫ2 < 0.4 the wealth
distribution does not follow a power law.
In contrast,
when ǫ1 and ǫ2 are drawn from the ranges, 0.8 < ǫ1 < 1.0
and 0 < ǫ2 < 0.1, power law distribution back again.

It now appears that to achieve a power law in such a
generic situation, the following criteria are to be fulﬁlled:

general case with random and quenched ǫ1 and ǫ2: The

0 < ǫ1 < 1 and 0 < ǫ2 < 1 in one case and in the other
case, they are chosen from the ranges, 0.5 < ǫ1 < 1 and
0 < ǫ2 < 0.5. Both show power laws with the same expo-
nent around 3.0 (the two distributions almost superpose). A
straight line (with slope -3.0) is drawn to demonstrate the
power law in the log-log scale.

•

•

It is essential to have the randomness or disorder
in the elements ǫ1 and ǫ2 to be quenched,

In the most general case, ǫ1 should be drawn from
a uniform distribution whose upper bound has to
be 1 and for ǫ2 the lower bound has to be 0. Then a
power law with higher exponent α = 3 is achieved.
To have a power law with exponent α = 2, the
matrix elements are to be drawn from the same
distribution. (This choices automatically make the
transition matrices to have nonzero determinants.)

The above points are not supported by any analytically
rigorous reasoning at this stage. However, the observa-
tion seems to bear important implications in terms of
generation of power law distributions.

When the disorder or randomness in the elements ǫ1
and ǫ2 change with time (i.e., not quenched) unlike the
situation just discussed above, the problem is perhaps
similar to the mass diﬀusion and aggregation model by
Majumdar, Krishnamurthy and Barma [40]. The mass
model is deﬁned on a one dimensional lattice with pe-
riodic boundary condition. A fraction of mass from a
randomly chosen site is assumed to be continually trans-
ported to any of its neighbouring sites at random. The
total mass between the two sites then is unchanged (one
site gains mass and the other loses the same amount) and
thus the total mass of the system remains conserved. The
mass of each site evolves as

mi(t + 1) = (1

ηi)mi(t) + ηjmj(t).

ated from that site i and joins either of its neighbouring

sites j = i
−
mains at that site whereas a fraction ηj of mass mj from
the neighbouring site joins the mass at site i. Now if we
identify ǫ1 = (1
ηi) and ǫ2 = ηj then this model is just
the same as described by the general transition matrix
as discussed so far. If ηi’s are drawn from a random and
uniform distribution in [0, 1] then a mean ﬁeld calcula-
tion (which turns out to be exact in the thermodynamic
limit) brings out the stationary mass distribution P (m)
to be a Gamma distribution:

−

(22)

P (m) =

−2m/m,

4m
m2 e
where m is the average mass of the system. It has been
numerically checked that there seems to be no apprecia-
ble change in the distribution even when the lattice is not
considered. Lattice seems to play no signiﬁcant role in
the case of kinetic theory like wealth distribution mod-
els as well. Incidentally, this distribution with m = 1 is
exactly the same as the Gamma distribution [eqn. (9)],
mentioned in section IV when one considers n = 2 in
that. The index n equals to 2 when one puts λ = 1
4 in
the relation (10).

In the general situation (ǫ1 6

= ǫ2), when both the pa-
rameters are drawn from a random and uniform distribu-
tion in [0, 1], the emerging distribution very nearly fol-
lows the above expression (22). Only when the random-
ness in them is quenched (ﬁxed in time), there is a pos-
sibility of getting a power law as it is already discussed.
The Gamma distribution [eqn. (22)] and the numerically
obtained distributions for diﬀerent cases (as discussed in
the text) are plotted in the Fig. 8 in support of the above
discussions.

VII. ROLE OF SELECTIVE INTERACTION

So far the models of wealth exchange processes have
been considered where a pair of agents are selected ran-
domly. However, interactions or trade among agents in
a society are often guided by personal choice or some
social norms or some other reasons. Agents may like to
interact selectively and it would be interesting to see how
the Individual wealth distribution is inﬂuenced by selec-
tion [20]. Selective interaction in a society already exists
in a way in the concept of a family. The members of
a same family are unlikely to trade (or interact) among
each other. It may be worth to examine the role played
by the concept of ‘family’ in wealth distributions of fam-
ilies: ‘family wealth distribution’ for brevity. A family in
a society usually consists of more than one agent. In com-
puter simulation, the agents belonging to a same family
are coloured to keep track of. To ﬁnd wealth distribu-
tions of families, the contributions of the same family
members are added up. In Fig. 9 family wealth distri-
butions are plotted for three cases: (i) families consist

The distributions are clearly not pure exponential, but
modiﬁed exponential distributions (Gamma type distri-
butions) with diﬀerent peaks and diﬀerent widths which
is quite expected (The probability of zero income of a
family is zero.). Modiﬁed exponential distribution is also
supported by ﬁtting real data [14].

Some special ways of incorporating ‘selection’ may play
a deﬁnitive role in the individual wealth distributions
which can be seen as follows. Let us deﬁne a ‘class’ of an
agent by some index (ǫ). The class may be understood in
terms of some sort of eﬃciency of accumulating wealth

or some other closely related property. Therefore, ǫ’s
are assumed to be quenched. It is assumed that during
the interactions, the agents may convert an appropriate
amount of wealth proportional to their eﬃciency factor
in their favour or against. Now, the model can be under-
stood in terms of the general form of equations:

wi(t + 1) = ǫiwi(t) + ǫjwj (t),

(23)

wj(t + 1) = (1

ǫi)wi(t) + (1

ǫj)wj (t),

−

−

where ǫi’s are quenched random numbers between 0 and
1 (randomly assigned to the agents at the beginning).
Now let us suppose that the agents are given a choice to
whom not to interact with. This option, in fact, is not
unnatural in the context of a real society where individual
or group opinions are important. There has been a lot of
works on the process and dynamics of opinion formations
[5, 30] in model social systems. In the present model it
may be imagined that the ‘choice’ is simply guided by the
relative class index of the two agents. It is assumed that
an interaction takes place when the ratio of two class fac-
tors remain within certain upper limit. Our requirement
for interaction (trade) to happen is then 1 < ǫi/ǫj < τ ,
where ǫi > ǫj. Wealth distributions for various values of
τ are numerically investigated. Power laws in the tails
are obtained in all cases.
In Fig. 10 the distributions
for τ = 2 and τ = 4 are shown. Power laws are clearly
seen with a exponent α = 3.5 (a straight line with slope
around -3.5 is drawn) which means the Pareto index ν
is close to 2.5. It is not further investigated whether the
exponent α actually diﬀers in a signiﬁcant way for dif-
ferent choices of τ . It has been shown that preferential
behaviour [24] generates power law in money distribu-
tion with some imposed conditions which allows the rich
to get higher probability of getting richer. The rich is
also favoured in some kind of asymmetric exchange rules
as proposed in [29] where power law results in. The dice
is always loaded in favour of the rich otherwise the rich
can not be the rich!

VIII. MEASURE OF INEQUALITY

Emergence of Pareto’s law signiﬁes the existence of in-
equality in wealth in a population. Inequality or dispar-
ity in wealth or income is known to exist in almost all
societies. To have a quantitative idea of inequality one
generally plots Lorenz curve and then calculates Gini co-
eﬃcient. Here the entropy approach [35] is adopted and
the time evolution of an appropriate quantity is examined
which may be regarded as a measure of wealth-inequality.
Let us consider w1, w2,....wN be the wealths of N
N
i=1 wi be the total wealth
agents in a system. Let W =
of all the agents. Now pi = wi/W can be considered as
the fraction of wealth the i-th agent shares. Thus each

giving the maximum value of S to be lnN where it is
a limit of equality (everyone possesses the same wealth).
A measure of inequality should be something which mea-
sures a deviation from the above ideal situation. Thus
one can have a measure of wealth-inequality to be

The greater the value of H, the greater the inequality is.
It is seen that the wealth exchange algorithms are so
designed that the resulting disparity or variance (or mea-
sure of inequality), in eﬀect, increases with time. Wher-
ever power law in distribution results in, the distribution
naturally broadens which indicates that variance (σ2) or
the inequality measure [H in eqn. (26)] should increase.
In the Fig. 11 and in Fig. 12 time evolution of inequality
measure H and variance σ2 respectively are plotted with
time for three models to have a comparison. It is appar-
ent that the measure of inequality in steady state attains

diﬀerent levels due to diﬀerent mechanisms of wealth ex-
change processes, giving rise to diﬀerent power law expo-
nents. The growth of variance is seen to be diﬀerent for
diﬀerent models considered, which result in power laws
with distinctly diﬀerent exponents as discussed in the
text. The power law exponents (α) appear to be related
to the magnitude of variance that is attained in equilib-
rium in the ﬁnite systems.

IX. DISTRIBUTION BY MAXIMIZING
INEQUALITY

It is known that probability distribution of wealth of
majority is diﬀerent from that of handful of minority (rich
people). ‘Disparity’ is more or less a reality in any econ-
omy. One may then think of an wealth exchange pro-
cess within the present framework, in a way that the
interactions among agents eventually lead to increasing
variance.
It is numerically examined whether the pro-
cess of forcing the system to have ever increasing vari-
ance (measure of disparity) leads to a power law as it
is known that power law is usually associated with inﬁ-
nite variance. Evolution of variance, σ2 =
2
i
is calculated after each interaction in the framework of
pure gambling model [the pair of equations (7)] and it
is then forced to increase monotonically by comparing
this to the previously calculated value (the average value
w is ﬁxed by virtue of the model). This resulted in a
very large variance under this imposed condition. The
inequality factor H also likewise increases monotonically
and attains a high value. A power law is obtained with
exponent α close to 1. None of the available models does
get such a low value of the exponent; the variance in the
usual models do generally settle at a level much lower
than that is obtained in such a way. This resulting dis-
tribution of wealth is plotted in a log-log scale in Fig. 13.

Power law, however, could not be obtained by the same
way in the case of a non-conserved model like the follow-
ing: wi(t + 1) = wi(t)
δ, where the increase or decrease
(δ) in wealth (w) of any agent is independent of any other.
It has also been noted, considering some of the avail-
able models, larger the variance, smaller the exponent
one gets. For example, the variance is seen to attain
higher values (with time) in the model of distributed
(random) saving propensities [18] compared to the model
of selective interaction [20] and the resulting power law

exponent α is close to 2.0 in the former case whereas it
is close to 3.5 in the later. In the present situation the
variance attains even higher values and the exponent α
seems to be close to 1, the lowest among all.

X. CONFUSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS

As it is seen, the exchange of wealth in various
modes generates a wide variety of distributions within
the framework of simple wealth exchange models as dis-
cussed. In this review, some basic structure and essence
of interactions are looked at which are fundamental to
bring out the desired distributions. In this kind of agent
based models (for some general discussions, see [37]) the
division of labour, demand and supply and the human
qualities (selﬁsh act or altruism) and eﬀorts (like invest-
ments, business) which are essential ingredients in classi-
cal economics are not considered explicitly. What causes
the exchange of wealth of a speciﬁc kind among agents is
not fundamental here.

Models are conserved; no inﬂow or outﬂow of money/
wealth in or from the system. It is not primary to look
for inﬂation, taxation, debt, investment returns etc. of
and in an economic system for the kind of questions that
are addressed here. The essence of complexities of inter-
actions can be understood from the simple (microscopic)
exchange rules much the same way the simple logistic
equations that went on to interpret ‘roads to Chaos’ and
open up a new horizon of thinking of a complex phe-
nomenon like Turbulence [28].

Some models of zero sum wealth exchange are exam-
ined here in this review. One starts thinking in a fresh
way how the distributions emerge out of the kind of al-
gorithmic exchange processes that are involved. The ex-
change processes can be understood in a general way
2 transi-
by looking at the structure of associated 2
tion matrices. Wealths of individuals evolve to have a
speciﬁc distribution in a stead state through the kind
of interactions which are basically stochastic in nature.
The distributions shift away from Boltzmann-Gibbs like
exponential to Gamma type distributions and in some
cases distributions emerge with power law tails known as
Pareto’s law (P (w)

w−α).

×

It is also seen that the wealth distributions seems to
be inﬂuenced by personal choice. In a real society, peo-
ple usually do not interact arbitrarily rather do so with
purpose and thinking. Some kind of personal preference
is always there which may be incorporated in some way
or other. Power law with distinctly diﬀerent exponent
(α = 3.5, Pareto exponent ν = 2.5) is achieved through a
certain way of selective interactions. This value of Pareto
index ν does not correspond to what is generally ob-
tained empirically. However, the motivation is not to
attach much importance to the numerical value at the
outset rather than to focus on the fact of how power law
emerges with distinctly diﬀerent exponents governed by
the simple rules of wealth exchange.

The fat tailed distributions (power laws) are usually
associated with large variance, which can be a measure
of disparity. Economic disparity usually exists among a
population. The detail mechanism leading to disparity
is not always clear but it can be said to be associated
with the emergence of power law tails in wealth distri-
butions. Monotonically increasing variance (with time)
can be associated with the emergence of power law in in-
dividual wealth distributions. The mean and variance of
a power law distribution can be analytically derived [25]
to see that they are ﬁnite when the power law exponent
3, the variance diverges but
α is greater than 3. For α
≤
then the mean is ﬁnite. In case of the models discussed
here in this review, mean is kept ﬁxed but large or en-
hanced variance is observed in diﬀerent models whenever
there results in a power law. It remains a question what
can be the mechanisms (in the kind of discrete and con-
served models) that generate large variance and power
law tails. Large and increasing variance is also associ-
ated with lognormal distributions. A simple multiplica-
tive stochastic process like w(t + 1) = ǫ(t)w(t) can be
used to explain the emergence of lognormal distribution
and indeﬁnite increase in variance. However, empirical
evidence shows that the Pareto index and some other
appropriate indices (Gibrat index, for example), gener-
ally dwindle within some range [32] indicating that the
variance (or any other equivalent measure of inequality)
does not increase forever. It seems to attain a saturation,
given suﬃcient time. This is indeed the case the numer-
ical results suggest. Normally there occurs simultaneous
increase of variance and mean in statistical systems (in
fact, the relationship between mean and variance goes by
wb know as Taylor’s power law [38]
a power law as σ2
as curiously observed in many natural systems). In this
conserved model the mean is not allowed to vary as it is
ﬁxed by virtue of the model. It may be the case that σ2
then has a deﬁnite (saturation) value at equilibrium. In
order to look for the limit of σ2, an artiﬁcial situation is
constructed to test the truth of large variance and power
law in a reverse way.

Understanding the emergence of power law [25, 26] it-
self has been of great interest for decades. There is usu-
ally no accepted framework which may explain the origin
and wealth of varieties of its appearance. It is often ar-
gued that the dynamics which generate power laws is

in an economy wealth (or money) of an agent multiplies
and that is coupled to the large number of interacting
agents. The generic stochastic Lotka-Volterra systems
like wi(t+1) = ǫwi(t)+aw(t)
bwi(t)w(t) have been stud-
−
ied [30, 31] to achieve power law distributions in wealth.
However, these kinds of models are not discussed in this
review as the basic intention had been to understand the
ideas behind models of conserved wealth which the above
kind is not.

In a twist of thinking, let us imagine a distribution
curve which can be stretched in any direction as one
wishes to have, keeping the area under this to be in-

variant. If now the curve is pulled too high around the
left then the right hand side is to fall oﬀ too quickly, ex-
ponential decay is a possible option then. On the other
hand, if the width of it is to be stretched too far (dis-
tribution becomes fat) at the right hand side, it should
then decay fairly slowly giving rise to a possible power
law fall at the right end while keeping the area under the
curve preserved. What makes such a stretching possible?
This review has been an attempt to integrate some
ideas regarding models of wealth distributions and to re-
discover things with a fresh outlook. In the way many
confusions, conjectures and conclusions emerged where
many questions possibly have been answered with fur-
ther questions. At the end of the day, the usefulness

of this (review) may be measured by further curiosities
and enhanced attention on the subject if at all this may
generate.

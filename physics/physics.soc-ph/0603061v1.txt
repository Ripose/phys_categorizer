Abstract

In this paper we tackle the problem of estimating the power-law tail exponent
of income distributions by using the Hill’s estimator. A subsample semi-parametric
bootstrap procedure minimising the mean squared error is used to choose the power-
law cutoﬀ value optimally. This technique is applied to personal income data for
Australia and Italy.

1 Introduction

Since Pareto it has been recognized that a power-law provides a good ﬁt for
the distribution of high incomes [1]. The Pareto’s law asserts that the com-
α
plementary cumulative distribution P> (y) = 1
,
with y
u, where u > 0 is the threshold value of the distribution and α > 0
turns out to be some kind of index of inequality of distribution. The ﬁt of such
distribution is usually performed by judging the degree of linearity in a double
logarithmic plot involving the empirical and theoretical distribution functions,
in such a way that the estimation of u of the distribution does not seem to

follow a neutral procedure. Moreover, recent studies have criticized the relia-
bility of this geometrical method by showing that linear-ﬁt based methods for
estimating the power-law exponent tend to provide biased estimates, while the
maximum likelihood estimation method produces more accurate and robust
estimates [2,3]. Hill proposed a conditional maximum likelihood estimator for
α based on the k largest order statistics for non-negative data with a Pareto’s
y[1], with y[i] denoting
tail [4]. That is, if y[n] ≥

the ith order statistic, are the sample elements put in descending order, then
the Hill’s estimator is

where n is the sample size and k an integer value in [1, n]. Unfortunately,
the ﬁnite-sample properties of the estimator (Eq. 1) depend crucially on the
choice of k: increasing k reduces the variance because more data are used,
but it increases the bias because the power-law is assumed to hold only in the
extreme tail.

Over the last twenty years, estimation of the Pareto’s index has received con-
siderable attention in extreme value statistics [5]. All of the proposed esti-
mators, including the Hill’s estimator, are based on the assumption that the
number of observations in the upper tail to be included, k, is known. In prac-
tice, k is unknown; therefore, the ﬁrst task is to identify which values are
really extreme values. Tools from exploratory data analysis, as the quantile-
quantile plot and/or the mean excess plot, might prove helpful in detecting
graphically the quantile y[n−k] above which the Pareto’s relationship is valid;
however, they do not propose any formal computable method and, imposing
an arbitrary threshold, they only give very rough estimates of the range of
extreme values.

Given the bias-variance trade-oﬀ for the Hill’s estimator, a general and for-
mal approach in determining the best k value is the minimisation of the Mean
Squared Error (MSE ) between ˆαn (k) and the theoretical value α. Unfortu-
nately, in empirical studies of data the theoretical value of α is not known.
Therefore, an attempt to ﬁnd an approximation to the sampling distribu-
tion of the Hill’s estimator is required. To this end, a number of innovative
techniques in the statistical analysis of extreme values proposes to adopt the
powerful bootstrap tool to ﬁnd the optimal number of order statistics adap-
tively [6,7,8,9]. By capitalizing on these recent advances in the extreme value
statistics literature, in this paper we adopt a subsample semi-parametric boot-
strap algorithm in order to make a reasonable and more automated selection
of the extreme quantiles useful for studying the upper tail of income distri-
butions and to end up at less ambiguous estimates of α. This methodology
is described in Section 2 and its application to Australian and Italian income

data [10,11] is given in Section 3. Some conclusive remarks are reported in
Section 4.

2 Estimation Technique for Threshold Selection

In this section we consider the problem of ﬁnding the optimal threshold u∗
n –
or equivalently the optimal number k∗ of extreme sample values above that
threshold – to be used for estimation of α. In order to achieve this task, we
minimize the MSE of the Hill’s estimator (Eq. 1) for a series of thresholds
un = y[n−k], and pick the un value at which the MSE attains its minimum
as u∗
n. Given that diﬀerent threshold series choices deﬁne diﬀerent sets of
possible observations to be included in the upper tail of a speciﬁc observed
sample yn =
, only the observations exceeding a certain
threshold that are additionally distributed according to a Pareto’s cumula-
tive distribution function P D ˆαn(k),un (y) are included in the series. In order
to check this condition, we perform for each threshold in the original sam-
ple a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S ) goodness-of-ﬁt test for the null hypothe-
sis H0 : ˆFn (y) = P D ˆαn(k),un (y) versus the general alternative of the form
= P D ˆαn(k),un (y), where ˆFn (y) is the empirical distribution func-
H1 : ˆFn (y)
tion, and ˆαn (k) is a prior estimate for each threshold un of the Pareto’s tail
index obtained through the Hill’s statistic. Following the methodology in [12],
the formal steps in making a test of H0 are as follows:

To obtain an estimate of ﬁnite-sample bias and variance (and thus MSE ) at
each threshold coming from the null hypothesis H0, a natural criterion is to use
the bootstrap [13]. In its purest form, the bootstrap involves approximating an
unknown distribution function, F (y), by the empirical distribution function,
ˆFn (y). However, most times the empirical distribution model from which one
resamples in a purely non-parametric bootstrap is not a good approximation
of the distribution shape in the tail. Therefore, we initially smooth the tail

Let us here summarize the adopted methodology:

The Hill’s estimator (Eq. 1) is reported in Figs. 2 for Australia (a) and Italy

solid lines). In these ﬁgures, the optimal number of extreme sample values are
reported, namely k∗ = 299 for Australia and k∗ = 3222 for Italy, providing
the following values for the tail power-law exponents: ˆα∗
0.2
and ˆα∗
0.1, where the errors (with 95% conﬁdence) have been
obtained through the jackknife method [15]. In these computations, we have
used 1000 resamples and the subsample size has been set equal to the number
of observations not rejected by the K-S test at the 5% level (see Section 2
and Figs. 1 (a) and (b)). Repeated calculations with a diﬀerent number of
replications produce a spread of tail index estimates with deviations inside
the 95% uncertainty band (dashed lines in the ﬁgures), showing therefore
numerical robustness of our results. We have here obtained more precise values
of the power-law tails than the previous one reported in the literature [11].

in avoiding deviations from linearity for the largest observations that might
strongly inﬂuence the estimation of α, illustrating therefore the importance of
optimally choosing the tail threshold.

4 Concluding Remarks

In this paper we have considered the problem of the estimation of the power-
law tail exponent of income distributions and we have adopted a subsample
semi-parametric bootstrap procedure in order to arrive at less ambiguous esti-
mates of α. This methodology has been empirically applied to the estimation
of personal income distribution data for Australia and Italy. The reliability
and robustness of the results have been tested by running diﬀerent repeated
bootstrap replications and comparing the variability of the estimates through
a jackknife method.

From the economic point of view, this technique for the estimation of the
Pareto’s tail index of income distribution is expected to allow a deeper under-
standing of both the way in which cyclical ﬂuctuations in economic activity
aﬀect factor income shares and the channels through which these eﬀects work
through the size distribution of income, which are issues of relevance for the
modeling of the income process in the high-end tail of the distribution.

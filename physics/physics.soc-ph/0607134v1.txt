Real-world networks process structured connections since they have non-trivial vertex degree
correlation and clustering. Here we propose a toy model of structure formation in real-world weighted
network. In our model, a network evolves by topological growth as well as by weight change. In
addition, we introduce the weighted assortativity coeﬃcient, which generalizes the assortativity
coeﬃcient of a topological network, to measure the tendency of having a high-weighted link between
two vertices of similar degrees. Network generated by our model exhibits scale-free behavior with a
tunable exponent. Besides, a few non-trivial features found in real-world networks are reproduced
by varying the parameter ruling the speed of weight evolution. Most importantly, by studying the
weighted assortativity coeﬃcient, we found that both topologically assortative and disassortative
networks generated by our model are in fact weighted assortative.

INTRODUCTION

There is a wave of interest to study complex networks
by statistical physical means [1, 2, 3]. The area of stud-
ies include the Internet [4, 5, 6], the World-Wide Web
[7], scientiﬁc collaboration networks (SCN) [8, 9], biolog-
ical networks [10, 11] and the world-wide airport network
(WAN) [12]. In all these cases, one can naturally identify
the subject under study with a graph. For instance, an
airport in a WAN can be represented by a vertex; and
there is a link between two vertices if and only if there
is a direct ﬂight between the corresponding airports. Al-
though these complex networks are drawn from vastly
diﬀerent systems in the real world, they exhibit the fol-
lowing universal properties:

1. Scale-free behavior of degree distribution: Let P (k)
be the probability that any vertex is connected to
k other vertices (i.e. the vertex is of degree k). In
many real-world networks, P (k) ∼ k−γ with 2 <
∼
γ <

∼ 3 [13].

2. Clustering property: Clustering of a vertex ci gives
the probability that two nearest neighbors are con-
nected with each other. And the average clustering
i ci/N , where N is the number of
coeﬃcient C =
vertices in the network, measures the global den-
sity of interconnected vertex triplets in the network.
Real-world networks in general exhibit higher clus-
tering coeﬃcient than those in random networks
[14].

P

3. Small-world property: A network is said to have
small-world property if the average shortest path
length between two vertices scales at most loga-
rithmically with N for ﬁxed mean degree [14, 15].

4. Correlations of degree: An assortative (A disassor-
tative) network tends to connect vertices with sim-
ilar (dissimilar) degrees. Previous studies found
that social networks tend to be assortative while
technological and biological networks are generally
disassortative [16].

Various network models have been proposed to sim-
ulate or explain the properties found in complex net-
works in the real world. For instance, the Erd¨os-R´enyi
random graph model [17, 18] generates static networks
that exhibit small-world property. Nonetheless, the de-
gree distribution of the network generated is Possionian
rather than a power-law. Later on, Barab´asi and Albert
(BA) extended the Erd¨os-R´enyi random graph model by
evolving the network using a linear preferential attach-
ment mechanism [13]. The ideas behind the BA model
are that most real-world networks tend to growth with
time, and a new vertex tends to connect to pre-existing
high-degree vertices. Sen further incorporated non-linear
growth property of the number of links to the BA model
by demanding the number of links of the vertex added
at time t to be tθ for some positive constant θ [19]. Both
the BA model and the Sen model generate networks with
scale-free topology; but they failed to reproduce the de-
gree correlations and clustering properties of real-world
networks.

Structural organization of a network can be charac-
terized by the average clustering coeﬃcient C and the
assortativity coeﬃcient r [20]. However, these quantities
only depend on the topological structure of a network.
The relative importance between diﬀerent links is not
taken into consideration. To provide a better description
of a network, the intensity of interaction among vertices
should be taken into account. One may deﬁne the weight
of a link wij as the intensity of interaction between ver-
tices i and j, and the vertex strength si as the sum of

weight of the links connected to i:

si =

wij ,

Xj∈Γ(i)

(1)

where Γ(i) denotes the nearest neighbors of i. For in-
stance, the weight wij in WAN refers to the number of
seats available on the direct ﬂight connections between
the airports i and j. And si represents the total traf-
ﬁc going through the airport i. To probe the weighted
networks’ architecture, a set of weighted quantities are
introduced, such as the weighted average clustering co-
eﬃcient Cw and the weighted average nearest-neighbor
degree kw
nn(k) [21]. However, no one has proposed a quan-
tity that can directly measure the correlations of degree
with inclusion of weight so far. Here we introduce the
weighted assortativity coeﬃcient rw to measure the ten-
dency of having a high-weighted link between two ver-
tices of similar degrees. In addition, we propose a model
that incorporates the essential features of strength pref-
erential attachment, nonlinear growth of number of links,
and weight evolution of existing links. We call this the
Weight Evolution Model. The rule of weight evolution
are based on the notion that “the rich always gets richer”.
In other words, high-weighted link has higher probability
to evolve. Besides, inspired by the work of Dorogovtsev
and Mendes [22], existing links in the graph can be re-
moved. By altering the speed of weight evolution, our
model can generate both assortative and disassortative
networks with scale-free behavior and non-trivial clus-
tering properties. Most importantly, both topologically
assortative and disassortative networks generated by our
model are in fact weighted assortative.

In Section II, we deﬁne the Weight Evolution Model.
We report our analytical calculations and numerical re-
sults on the probability distributions of strength of vertex
and weight of link in Section III. Then in Section IV we
deﬁne the weighted assortativity coeﬃcient and compare
the organizational structure found in real-world networks
with our numerical simulations. Finally, we give a brief
summary in Section V.

II. WEIGHT EVOLUTION MODEL

The model starts with a small number N0 of fully
connected undirected vertices. The weight of all the
N0(N0 − 1)/2 initial links are set to w0.
In each time
step, the network evolves under the following rules:

1. Topological growth: A new vertex is added to the
network. We assume that the number of links of
the new vertex is an increasing function of the net-
work size. Speciﬁcally, a vertex with
links are
added to the network at time t for some ﬁxed con-
stants p > 0 and 0 < θ < 1. (Here [x] denotes the
value of x rounded to the nearest integer.) These
ptθ
links are all of weight w0 and are randomly
connected to the existing vertices according to the

ﬁned as [23, 24]

2. Evolution of weight : The link between vertices i
and j is chosen to evolve with probability Qi,j pro-
portional to its weight, namely

The weight will update according to the equation

where

sgn(q) = 

1 if q > 0 ,


At time step t, this process will repeat
and a link is removed if the weight equals to 0.

times

Note that p, q and θ are the tunable parameters in this
model.

Clearly, our model generalizes the BA model [13] and
the Sen model [19]. In particular, our model is reduced
to the BA model by setting θ = 0, q = 0, w0 = 1, and
reduced to the Sen model by setting 0 ≤ θ ≤ 1, p = 1,
q = 0 and w0 = 1.

We now justify the validity of our rules. Note that in
most real-world networks, new vertices are introduced
one at a time; and they tend to connect to the pre-
existing high strength vertices. In the example of WAN,
new airport tends to establish ﬂights to existing airports
with heavy traﬃc. Our topological growth process is
used to capture this kind of network growth. Moreover,
our weight evolution mechanism models the trend that
the link with higher weight have a higher probability to
evolve. For instance, in SCN [21], a vertex represent a
scientist and a link is present if two scientists have co-
authored at least one paper. The weight between two
scientists is higher if they have higher number of co-
authored papers. Naturally, if the weight between two
scientists is high, the probability for them to collaborate
again is also high.

III. STRENGTH AND WEIGHT

In our model, the processes of topological growth and
weight evolution are Markovian. Thus, the evolution of
our network can be calculated accurately by mean ﬁeld
approximation. Appendix A reports the mean ﬁeld cal-
culation of the probability distribution of vertex strength
P (s) and probability distribution of weight of link P (w).
We found that P (s) ∼ s−γs and P (w) ∼ w−γw , where

γs = 1 −

,

γw = 1 +

w0p + q
(θ + 1)q (cid:21)

(cid:20)

.

(7)

To check the validity of our analytical solution, we per-
formed numerical simulations on our network model for
diﬀerent values of q and θ. Since p, q and w0 govern the
relative speed between new link addition and weight evo-
lution, one can ﬁx two of these three parameters without
losing any generality.
In this paper, we ﬁx p = 1 and
w0 = 10 unless otherwise stated. Besides, we set the
number of initial vertices N0 to 5; and we have checked
that networks generated by a diﬀerent value of N0 ex-
hibit similar behaviors as long as N0 ≪ N . Using this
set of parameters, we found that statistical data collected
from the network equilibrate after t >
∼ 5 000. Hence, we
collect all our statistical data at t = 10 000 and all the
data reported here have been averaged over 50 indepen-
dent runs. Our model successfully reproduces the scale-
free behavior of the probability distributions of strength
and weight with a tunable exponent that depends on the
microscopic mechanism ruling the weight evolution. We
found in Appendix B that the numerical simulation re-
sults agree with the mean ﬁeld approximation.

IV. CLUSTERING AND CORRELATIONS

In this section, we ﬁrst discuss the quantities used to
characterize the clustering and correlations behaviors of
a network. Then we introduce the weighted assortativity
coeﬃcient rw. Finally, we report the numerical simula-
tion results of our model.

A. Quantities Characterizing A Weighted Network

We overload the notation by labeling the vertex added
to the network in time step i also by i. The clustering of

3

i is deﬁned as

1

ci =

ki(ki − 1) Xj,h

aijaihajh ,

(8)

where ki is the degree of i and

aij =

(cid:26)

1 if a link exist between i and j ,
0 if there is no link between i and j .

(9)

If vertex i has less than two neighbors, ci is set to 0.
Clustering ci measures the local cohesiveness of vertex
i ci/N
i while the average clustering coeﬃcient C =
measures the global density of interconnected triples in
the network. Organizational structure of network can be
further studied via the degree-dependent average cluster-
ing coeﬃcient C(k),

P

C(k) =

1

N P (k) Xi:ki=k

ci ,

(10)

which is the mean clustering for vertices with degree k.
To have a better understanding of the organizational
structure of weighted networks, the weighted clustering
cw
i

is introduced and deﬁned as [21]

cw
i =

1

si(ki − 1) Xj,h

(wij + wih)
2

aijaihajh ,

(11)

If vertex i tends to form triples with other vertices by
its’ high-weighted links, then cw
i > ci meaning that the
topological clustering of i underrates the cohesiveness of
i. The weighted average clustering coeﬃcient Cw and
weighted degree-dependent average clustering coeﬃcient
Cw(k) are deﬁned as the average of cw
i over all vertices
and over all vertices with degree k, respectively [21].

The degree correlation is another important informa-
tion of the network. Recall that the network is said to be
assortative if the vertices tend to connect to other ver-
tices which have similar (dissimilar) properties. Newman
introduced the assortativity coeﬃcient [16, 20]

to measure the degree correlation between vertices, where
F (φ) denotes the set of the two vertices connected by
the φth link and M is the total number of links in the
network. This measure r is positive (negative) for assor-
tative (disassortative) networks; and r = 0 for a random

graph. To probe the degree correlation of the network,
one may also study the average nearest-neighbors degree,

4

which is deﬁned as [4]

knn(k) will underestimate the tendency for having heavy
traﬃc between two similar degree airports. To handle
this problem, Barrat et al. proposed the weighted aver-
age nearest-neighbor degree [21]

(13)

The degree-dependent average nearest-neighbors degree
knn(k) is the mean of knn,i restricted to the class of de-
gree k vertices.
In an assortative (disassortative) net-
work, vertices with high degree tend to connect to other
vertices with high (low) degree, thus knn(k) would be

weighted networks, high degree vertices could connect to
small degree vertices with low weight, while connect to
high degree vertices with high weight. For instance, in
WAN, the high degree airport i could have a lot of direct
ﬂight to another high degree airport j, while have less
number of ﬂight to a low degree airport h. In this case,

kw
nn,i =

If the degree-dependent weighted nearest-neighbors de-
gree kw
nn(k) is an increasing function of k, similar degree
vertices tend to link together. Besides, the weights of
these links tend to be high. Consequently, the network is
weighted assortative. Although one can ﬁgure out that
the network is assortative or disassortative if kw
nn(k) is
increasing or decreasing with k, a quantity directly de-
scribing the weighted assortativity is needed. Thus we
introduce the weighted assortativity coeﬃcient

where ̟i is the weight of the φth link, F (φ) is the set of
the two vertices connected by the φth link and H is the
total weight of all links in the network. Just like r, rw lies
between −1 and 1. Moreover, rw is positive for weighted
assortative networks, while negative for weighted disas-
sortative networks. If rw > r, two similar degree vertices

fact, rw reduces to r if all weights in the network are
equal. Furthermore, rw = r = 0 for a random graph.

B. Simulation Results

As shown in Fig. 1, our model can generate assortative
networks (r > 0), such as those found in social networks,
when q ≪ 0. Our model can also generate disassorta-
tive networks (r < 0), such as those found in techno-
logical networks, when q ≫ 0. Surprisingly, rw > 0
for both assortative and disassortative networks provided
that |q| >
∼ 7. This observation indicates that the topolog-
ical assortativity coeﬃcient underrates the contributions
of high-weighted links between similar degree vertices.
Our ﬁnding shows that studying the assortativity of a
network by considering network topology alone [16, 20]
does not give a complete picture of the organizational
structure of the network.

The diﬀerence between rw and r (Fig. 2) can be under-
stood qualitatively by considering the evolution mecha-
nisms of our model. For q ≫ 0, a newly added vertex is
the one with low degree and it tends to connect to ex-
isting high-strength and high-degree vertices. This pro-

cess leads to topologically disassortative behavior. Mean-
while, a link introduced at an early time, which connects
two old vertices having similar degrees together, tends to
be high-weighted as q > 0. This leads to the observed
weighted assortative behavior. On the other hand, as-
sortative networks emerge at q ≪ 0. It is because the

strength of old vertices are low. Hence, there is a high
chance for two young vertices having similar degrees to
connect. As θ increases, the strength of old vertices de-
crease while the new vertices enter the network with a
higher strength. Thus, the value of q required for the
emergence of assortative behavior increases with θ. This
is precisely what we have observed in Fig. 1.

As shown in Fig. 3, knn(k) exhibits decreasing power-
law behavior for q ≫ 0, indicating that the networks are
disassortative. For q ≪ 0, knn(k) is a gently increasing
function of k.
It is worth noting that in some empiri-
cal studies of real-world networks [21], both knn(k) and
kw
nn(k) show assortative behavior with kw
nn(k) > knn(k).

FIG. 5: C(k) and C w(k) for various q for θ = 0.3.

As shown in Fig. 4, our model successfully reproduces
these important features. Remarkably, rw < r while
kw
nn(k) > knn(k) for q ≪ 0. This points out that it is
diﬃcult to compare the weighted assortativity and topo-
logical assortativity by studying the diﬀerence between
kw
nn(k) and knn(k).
Two types of C(k) are found in real-world networks
[25, 26]. In the ﬁrst type, C(k) does not exhibit strong
dependency on k. While in the second type, C(k) shows
a decreasing power law spectrum. Fig. 5 clearly shows
that our model can reproduce both kinds of features. In

 

particular, C(k) is ﬂat for q ≪ 0 and it becomes a de-
creasing power law for q ≫ 0. Moreover, Cw(k) is larger
than C(k), especially at large k, which is a feature found
in real-world networks [21]. This result indicates that the
topological clustering coeﬃcient C(k) underestimate the
cohesiveness of the network. It is because C(k) cannot
tell us whether large degree vertices tend to form inter-
connected triples with its’ high-weighted links.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In summary, we have introduced the Weight Evolution
Model which couples dynamical evolution of weight with
topological network growth. We have also introduced
the weighted assortativity coeﬃcient rw to characterize
the degree correlation of a weighted network. Our model
reproduced many features found in real-world networks,
such as scale-free behavior, assortative and disassortative
behavior, and two types of clustering structures. Most
importantly, both topologically disassortative and assor-
tative networks are regarded as weighted assortative if
the weight of links is taken into account, indicating that
the topological assortativity coeﬃcient r underrates the
contributions of high-weighted links between similar de-
gree vertices. This result may give us some idea for why
social networks are found to be assortative, while techno-
logical networks and biological networks show an oppo-
site behavior in previous studies [16, 20]. It is instructive
to investigate if all real-world networks can be regarded
as weighted assortative.

APPENDIX A: ANALYTICAL CALCULATIONS
OF STRENGTH AND WEIGHT

Recall that initially the network is a complete graph
of N0 vertices. And in each time step a new vertex is
added. There are two ways to alter the strength of an
existing vertex i: (a) i is connected to the newly added
vertex j with probability Λi given by Eq. (2), or (b) the
weight of the link between i and one of its neighboring
vertices evolves according to Eqs. (3)–(5).

By mean ﬁeld approximation and by treating all dis-
crete variables as continuous, the strength si of the vertex
added at time i satisﬁes

for t > i. Note that the ﬁrst and second terms repre-
sent the strength change due to topological growth and

Since the total strength of the network increases

Putting Eq. (A2) into Eq. (A1) and using the initial con-
dition si(t = i) = w0[piθ], we conclude that

si(t) ≈ w0piθ

= w0ptθ

(θ+1)(w0p+2q)/2(w0p+q)

[2q−(θ−1)w0p]/2(w0p+q)

(A3)

Since one vertex is added to the network in each time
step, the network size N ≈t. The probability distribution
of vertex strength can be computed by

P (s) ≈

δ(s − sj(t))dj ,

(A4)

where δ(x) is the Dirac delta function. Combined with
Eq. (A3), we conclude that in the inﬁnite network size
limit, the mean ﬁeld approximation give P (s) ∼ s−γs for
min(si(t)) ≤ s ≤ max(si(t)), where

γs = 1 −

2(w0p + q)
(θ − 1)w0p − 2q (cid:21)

(cid:20)

.

(A5)

The behavior of P (s) can be classiﬁed according to the

value of q:

1. If q > qc ≡ (θ − 1)w0p/2, Eq. (A3) tells us that the
degree of existing vertices are generally larger than
the degree of the newly added vertex, i.e. si(t) ≥
sn ≡ w0ptθ for all i. Thus,

(A6)

In particular, the network evolves purely by topo-
logical growth for q = 0. And in this case, we ﬁnd
that γs = (θ − 3)/(θ − 1) which is independent of
p. Moreover, γs → 2 as q → ∞.

2. If q = qc, si(t) = sn which is the same for all i. In
this case, P (s) is a delta function. In contrast, P (s)
is a delta function only when θ = 1 (i.e., when the
network is fully connected) in the Sen model [19].

3. If q < qc, si(t) ≤ sn by Eq. (A3). In other words,
the newly added vertex have the highest strength.
Using a similar argument as in the case of q > qc,

FIG. 6: Probability distribution of strength P (s) for θ = 0.3.
A power-law function P (s) ∼ s−γ is obtained in the range of
(a) s < sn if q < qc = −3.5 and (b) s > sn if q > qc. The
dashed line corresponds to s = sn = 148. The insert compares
the values of γ obtained from data ﬁtting (ﬁlled circles) with
the analytical solution γs given by Eq. (A5) (solid line).

FIG. 7: Probability distribution of weight P (w) ∼ w−γw with
(a) q < 0 and (b) q > 0. The insert compares the values of γw
obtained from data ﬁtting (ﬁlled circles) and the mean ﬁeld
value given by Eq. (A10) (solid line) for θ = 0.3.

In addition, the weight distribution P (w), which gives
the probability that a link with weight w, obeys P (w) ∼

Fig. 6 reports P (s) obtained from numerical simula-
tions for diﬀerent values of q. It also compares the value
of exponent obtained from ﬁtting the numerically simu-
lated data with the value predicted by analytical calcu-
lation. P (s) follows a power-law function for q ≪ qc or
q ≫ qc with exponent agree well with the value given by
Eq. (A5). Note that P (s) is non-zero for s > sn when
q < qc (Fig. 6(a)) and for s < sn when q > qc (Fig. 6(b)).
This discrepancy is due to the fact that a small propor-
tion of vertices evolves diﬀerently from the prediction of
mean-ﬁeld approximation. However, this value dimin-
ishes to zero rapidly and thus our analytical calculation
remains valid. The weight probability distribution P (w)
for various q is displayed in Fig. 7 along with the com-
parison between the ﬁtted values of the exponent with
the analytical predictions. For q < 0, wij ≤ w0 for all
links, so the power-law function is obtained for w ≤ w0
(Fig. 7(a)). For q > 0, the power-law function is found
to be in the range of w ≥ w0 (Fig. 7(b)).

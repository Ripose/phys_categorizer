Introduction

A current paradigm in computer simulation studies of social sciences problems by physicists
is the emergence of consensus [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. The question is to establish when the dynamics
of a set of interacting agents that can choose among several options (political vote, opinion,
cultural features, etc.) leads to a consensus in one of these options, or when a state with several
coexisting social options prevail. The latter is called a polarized state. An important issue is
to identify mechanisms producing a polarized state in spite of general convergent dynamics.
When the agents are spatially distributed this problem shares many characteristics with the
problem of domain growth in the kinetics of phase transitions [7]: Consensus emerges when a
single spatial domain grows occupying the whole system, while polarization corresponds to a
situation in which the system does not order and diﬀerent spatial domains compete.

We consider here stochastic dynamic models naturally studied by computer simulations. We
will ﬁrst review some basic results for the voter model [8]. This is a binary option stochastic
model, and probably the simplest model of collective behavior. We focus on the dynamical eﬀect
of who interacts with whom, that is on the consequences of diﬀerent networks of interaction.
The fact whether consensus is reached or not depends on characteristics of the network such
as dimensionality. Next we consider a model proposed by Axelrod [9] for the dissemination
of culture. This model can be considered as a multivariable elaboration of the voter model
dynamics. Time scales of evolution scale with system size in this model in the same way as for
the voter model. We also discuss for this model the role of diﬀerent networks of interaction.
Finally we consider the eﬀect of exogenous stochastic perturbations that account for cultural
drift.

Voter model

The voter model [8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16] is deﬁned by a set of “voters” with two
opinions or spins si = ±1 located at the nodes of a network. The elementary dynamical step
consists in randomly choosing one node (asynchronous update) and assigning to it the opinion,
or spin value, of one of its nearest neighbors, also chosen at random. This mechanism of opinion
formation reﬂects complete a lack of self-conﬁdence of the agents. It could be appropriate for
describing processes of opinion formation in certain groups of teenagers in which imitation is
prevalent. The dynamical rule implemented here corresponds to a node-update. An alternative

1

dynamics is given by a link-update rule in which the elementary dynamical step consists in
randomly choosing a pair of nearest neighbor spins, i.e. a link, and randomly assigning to both
nearest neighbor spins the same value if they have diﬀerent values, and leaving them unchanged
otherwise. These two updating rules are equivalent in a regular lattice, but they are diﬀerent
in a complex network in which diﬀerent nodes have diﬀerent number of nearest neighbors [14].
The voter model dynamics has two absorbing states, corresponding to situations in which
all the spins have converged to the si = 1 or to the si = −1 consensus states. The ordering
dynamics is stochastic and driven by interfacial noise. This is diﬀerent of the ordering dynamics
of a Glauber kinetic Ising model which is driven by minimization of surface tension. A standard
order parameter to describe the ordering process [12, 13] is the average of the interface density
ρ, deﬁned as the density of links connecting sites with diﬀerent spin value. In a disordered
conﬁguration with randomly distributed spins ρ ≃ 1/2, while for a completely ordered system
ρ ≃ 0. In regular lattices of dimensionality d ≤ 2 the system orders. This means that, in the
limit of large systems, there is a coarsening process with unbounded growth of spatial domains
of one of the absorbing states: consensus is reached. The asymptotic regime of approach to
the ordered state is characterized in d = 1 by a power law hρi ∼ t− 1
2 , while for the critical
dimension d = 2 a logarithmic decay is found hρi ∼ (ln t)−1 [10, 12]. Here the average h·i is an
ensemble average.

In regular lattices with d > 2 , as well as in small-world networks [17] and scale-free Barab´asi-
Albert networks [18], the voter dynamics does not order the system in the thermodynamic
limit of large systems[11, 13, 14]. Starting from a random initial condition and after an initial
transient, the system falls in a metastable partially ordered state. In the initial transient of
a given realization of the process, ρ initially decreases, indicating a partial ordering of the
system. After this initial transient ρ ﬂuctuates randomly around an average plateau value.
In a ﬁnite system the metastable state has a ﬁnite lifetime: a ﬁnite size ﬂuctuation takes the
system from the metastable state to one of the two ordered absorbing states. In this process
the ﬂuctuation orders the system and ρ changes from its metastable plateau value to ρ = 0
(see Fig. 1). The lifetime τ of the metastable state, for a regular lattice in d = 3 [11] and
also for a small-world network [13], scales linearly with the system size N, τ ∼ N, while a
scaling τ ∼ N 0.88 has been found [14] for the voter model in the scale-free Barab´asi-Albert
network. The fact that a large system does not order in a small-world or scale-free network
could seem counter-intuitive: one might argue that long distance links (small-world) or nodes
with a large number of links (hubs in a scale-free network) should be instrumental in ordering
the system. A counter argument is that what is observed corresponds to a network of large
dimensionality: these complex networks have an eﬀective inﬁnite dimension since the average
path length between two nodes grows logarithmically (or slower) with the system size.

In order to understand the diﬀerent role of dimensionality and degree distribution, i.e., the
probability for a node having k links (degree), one can consider the voter dynamics in the

2

Structured scale-free (SSF) network introduced in Ref. [19]. The SSF networks are scale-free,
with a degree distribution P (k) ∼ k−3 but are eﬀectively one dimensional since the average
path length scales linearly with system size L ∼ N. Results of simulations shown in Fig. 2
indicate that the dynamics of the voter model in the SSF network or in a regular d = 1 network
is essentially the same: the system orders with the average interface density decreasing with
a power law with characteristic exponent 1/2. This identiﬁes dimensionality and not degree
distribution as the relevant parameter to classify diﬀerent classes of ordering dynamics of the
voter model in complex networks.

The voter model can also be studied in other diﬀerent complex networks of dimension d > 1
characterized by a parameter p measuring the disorder of the network. This parameter is the
one originally used to characterize a small-world network [17], varying continuously from p = 0
(regular network) to p = 1 (random network). One ﬁnds that network disorder decreases the
lifetime of the metastable disordered states. Likewise, the lifetime of these states is decreased
when the networks have nodes with a large number of links [16].

Axelrod model

Axelrod [9] addressed the issue of the persistence of cultural diversity asking the following
question: if people tend to become more alike in their beliefs, attitudes and behavior when they
interact, why do not all diﬀerences eventually disappear? To answer this question he proposed a
model to explore mechanisms of competition between globalization (consensus) and coexistence
of several cultural options (polarization). The basic premise of the model is that the more similar
an actor is to a neighbor, the more likely the actor will adopt one of the neighbor’s traits. In
addition to treating culture as multidimensional (not a binary option), a novelty of the model
is that its dynamics takes into account the interaction between the diﬀerent cultural features.
The model is deﬁned by considering N agents as the nodes of a network of interaction. The
state of agent i is a vector of F components (cultural features) (σi1, σi2, · · · , σiF ). Each σif is
one of the q integer values (cultural traits) 1, . . . , q, initially assigned independently and with
equal probability 1/q. The time-discrete dynamics is deﬁned as iterating the following steps:

1. Select at random a pair of sites of the network connected by a link (i, j).

2. Calculate the overlap (number of shared features σik = σjk.) lij.

3. If 0 < lij < F , the link is said to be active and sites i and j interact with probability
lij/F (similarity rule). In case of interaction, choose g randomly such that σig 6= σjg and
set σig = σjg.

The model has qF equivalent cultural options. Consensus (global culture) is reached if a
domain of one of these options occupies the whole system. For q = 2 Axelrod’s model can be

3

viewed as a set of F coupled voter models. For a general value of q it still shares with the
voter model the basic stochastic dynamics driven by interfacial noise as shown in Fig. 3: An
initial condition of a bubble of one of the qF cultures on the background of another cultural
option with only one feature in common dissolves by interfacial noise. Several snapshots of the
dynamical evolution from random initial conditions in a d = 2 square lattice are shown in Fig.
4.[20] For a given value of F the evolution from initial random conditions leads to a state of
global culture (consensus) or a multicultural state depending on the value of q. The parameter
q is a measure of the degree of initial disorder in the system. The fact that multicultural
disordered states are reached illustrates how local convergence, enforced by the similarity rule
used in the dynamics, can generate global polarization.

A systematic analysis of the dependence on q can be carried out from the point of view of
Statistical Physics [21] through Monte Carlo computer simulations. Deﬁning an order parame-
ter as the mean value of the relative size of the largest homogeneous cultural domain Smax, one
ﬁnds a nonequilibrium order-disorder transition as shown in Fig. 5 for a d = 2 square lattice:
There exists a threshold value qc, such that for q < qc the system orders in a consensus mono-
cultural uniform state (< Smax > /N ∼ 1), while for q > qc the system freezes in a polarized or
multicultural state (< Smax >≪ N). The transition becomes sharp and well deﬁned for large
systems and it is a ﬁrst-order transition in d = 2, while it becomes a continuous transition
in d = 1 [22, 23, 24]. In d = 1 the Axelrod dynamics is an optimization dynamics for which
a Lyapunov potential can be found [24]. We note that F = 2 is a special case [21, 23] that
we do not discuss here. We also note that qc and the transition itself is deﬁned considering
the dynamical evolution form an initial random disordered conﬁguration and not for arbitrary
initial conditions. We use here a set of uniform random initial conditions, while other authors
have used a a Poisson distribution for the initial random values of q [21].

Axelrod model in complex networks

The network of interactions among the agents accounts for the local geography in Axelrod’s
model. Following our discussion of the voter model, it is natural to ask how the above results
for a regular network are modiﬁed when considering a complex network of interaction [25]. An
expectation is that with random long distance interactions, the heterogeneity sustained by local
interactions can no longer be maintained [9]. For a small-world network it is found that the
transition remains sharply deﬁned as the system size increases, but it is shifted to larger values
of q as the disorder parameter p is increased. So that, as expected, small-world connectivity
favors cultural globalization. This is shown in the phase diagram of Fig. 6 in which we observe
that for a given value of q in which the system is in a polarized state in regular network,
consensus (global culture) can be reached by increasing the disorder parameter of the network,
p.

In a scale-free Barab´asi-Albert network [18] the order-disorder transition of the Axelrod

4

model becomes system-size dependent and the critical value qc is shifted to larger and larger
values as N increases, so that a state of global culture (consensus) prevails in the limit of large
systems. In addition, for a ﬁxed large value of N and ﬁxed average connectivity < k >, qc is
larger in a scale-free network than the limiting value of qc found for p = 1 in a small-world
network: The scale free connectivity is more eﬃcient than a random connectivity (p = 1) in
promoting global culture. These results for the Axelrod model in small-world and scale-free
networks parallel what happens for a kinetic Ising model: the small-world connectivity increases
the critical temperature, while the critical temperature diverges with system size in a scale-free
network.

Similarly to the discussion of the voter model, we can ask here about the speciﬁc role
of the degree distribution in the fact that the transition disappears for a large systems in a
scale-free Barab´asi-Albert network. Considering again the Structured scale-free (SSF) network
introduced in Ref. [19] we ﬁnd that the transition remains here well deﬁned at a ﬁnite value
of q for large systems. The conclusion is that it is the spatial dimensionality of the interaction
network, and not just the presence of hubs, what gives rise to the divergence of qc with N. On
the other hand, hubs create local order in the system so that for the multicultural disordered
state in a SSF network < Smax > takes a ﬁnite value.

Cultural drift: Exogenous perturbations in Axelrod model

Among the open questions discussed by Axelrod in his original work [9] he mentions that
Perhaps the most interesting extension and at the same time, the most diﬃcult one to analyze
is cultural drift, and he suggests to model it as spontaneous changes of cultural traits. Cultural
drift takes into account that there is always some inﬂuence between neighbors even when they
have completely diﬀerent cultures. In the language of physics simulations he is asking about the
role of noise in the order-disorder transition discussed above. The stochastic dynamics giving
rise to this transition can be considered as a zero temperature dynamics. The question is if this
transition is robust against the presence of ﬂuctuations, or if any ﬁnite ﬂuctuation disorders
the system, as it happens in the d = 1 kinetic Ising model. Generally speaking noise is known
to have two diﬀerent eﬀects, one is to produce disorder by accumulation of ﬂuctuations, but
another one is to help the system in ﬁnding paths in which it can escape from frozen disordered
conﬁgurations, leading to ordered states. An alternative way of formulating the question is
then if external perturbations acting on a frozen multicultural state can take the system to the
consensus state. To address these issues we implement cultural drift in the model adding a
fourth step in the iterated loop of the dynamics deﬁned above [26]:

4. With probability r, perform a single feature perturbation in which randomly choosing
an agent i and one of its features f , the trait σif is replaced by a new randomly chosen value.
Simulation results for a d = 2 square lattice are shown in Fig. 7: We observe a transition
= r(1 − 1/q). The

from multicultural to consensus states controlled by an eﬀective noise rate r

′

5

factor (1 − 1/q) takes into account the probability that the single feature perturbation does not
change the value of the trait. This is a noise induced transition since the control parameter
is a noise property. In addition, the transition has universal scaling properties with respect
to q: the same result is found for diﬀerent values of q and a consensus state is found for any
value of q as r goes to zero. Therefore, cultural drift destroys the transition controlled by q
that was found in the absence of exogenous perturbations (r = 0). In this sense, noise is here
an essential parameter that changes completely the type of transition exhibited by the system.
An additional important point is the character of the states found at both sides of the noise
induced transition. The disordered multicultural state found for large r is no longer a frozen
conﬁguration, but rather it exhibits disordered noise-sustained dynamics. On the other hand,
the consensus or ordered state found for small r is metastable: Once one of the equivalent qF
cultural states is reached, the systems does not stay there forever, but eventually a ﬂuctuation
takes it from this state to another one of the equivalent qF states, as shown in Fig. 8.

Why does the noise rate cause a transition? There is here a competition between two time
scales, the time scale at which noise is acting (1/r) and the relaxation time of perturbations T .
For small noise rate r there is time to relax and the system decays to a consensus state, while for
a large noise rate, stochastic perturbations accumulate and multicultural disorder is built up.
The transition is then expected to occur for rT ∼ 1. The relaxation time T of perturbations
can be calculated as an exit time in a random walk [24, 26]. In a mean ﬁeld approximation
it is given as the time needed to reach consensus in a ﬁnite system following the voter model
dynamics. For a d = 2 square lattice this is T ∼ N ln N [11, 26]. The noise induced transition
occurs then for a system size dependent value of r, but curves as the ones plotted in Fig. 8
for diﬀerent values of N collapse into a single curve when plotted versus rN ln N [26]. The
general result is that in the limit of very large systems, disordered multicultural states prevail
at any noise rate. Therefore cultural drift causes global polarization in large systems, but as a
state with noise-sustained dynamics rather than a frozen conﬁguration of spatially coexisting
equivalent cultures.

Summary

We have reviewed some aspects of stochastic dynamical models of consensus formation.
The simple voter model has been used to illustrate how this stochastic dynamics is very much
aﬀected by the spatial background in which it takes place: Diﬀerent characteristics of the
network of interactions determine if consensus grows in the system or if a polarized disordered
state prevails. We have also considered these questions in a related model due to Axelrod which
goes beyond the usual binary options of spin models and that also incorporates interaction
among multivalued options. For this model we have also shown that exogenous stochastic
perturbations are essential, since they completely change the nature of the states reached by
the system in its dynamical evolution. An interesting open question for future developments is

6

to go beyond the static networks of interaction considered here, allowing for a co-evolution of
the network and the state of the agents in the network. This general idea of co-evolution has
been implemented already in other computer simulations of social dynamics [27].

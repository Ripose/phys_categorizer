I study the spatial organization of retail commercial activities. These are organized in a network
comprising “anti-links”, i.e. links of negative weight. From pure location data, network analysis leads
to a community structure that closely follows the commercial classiﬁcation of the US Department
of Labor. The interaction network allows to build a ’quality’ index of optimal location niches for
stores, which has been empirically tested.

Walking in any big city reveals the extreme diversity of retail store location patterns. Fig.

1 shows a map of
the city of Lyon (France) including all the drugstores, shoes stores and furniture stores. A qualitative commercial
organisation is visible in this map : shoe stores aggregate at the town shopping center, while furniture stores are
partially dispersed on secondary poles and drugstores are strongly dispersed across the whole town. Understanding
this kind of features and, more generally, the commercial logics of the spatial distribution of retail stores, seems a
complex task. Many factors could play important roles, arising from the distincts characteristics of the stores or the
location sites. Stores diﬀer by product sold, surface, number of employees, total sales per month or inauguration
date. Locations diﬀer by price of space, local consumer characteristics, visibility (corner locations for example) or
accessibility. Only by taking into account most of these complex features of retail world can we hope to understand
the logics of store commercial strategies, let alone ﬁnding potentially interesting locations for new businesses.

Here I show that location data alone suﬃces to reveal many important facts about the commercial organisation of
retail trade [1]. First, I quantify the interactions among activities using network analysis. I ﬁnd a few homogeneous
commercial categories for the 55 trades in Lyon. These groups closely match the usual commercial categories : personal
services, home furniture, food stores and apparel stores. Second, I introduce a quality indicator for the location of a
given activity and empirically test its relevance. I stress that these results are obtained from a mathematical analysis
of solely location data. This supports the importance of business location for retailers, a point that is intuitively
well-known in the ﬁeld, and summarized by the retailing “mantra” : the three points that matter most in a retailer’s
world are : location, location and ... location.

Finding meaningful commercial categories

To analyze in detail the interactions of stores of diﬀerent trades, I start from the spatial pair correlations. These
functions are used to reveal store-store interactions, as atom-atom interactions are deduced from atomic distribution
functions in materials science [2]. Tools from that discipline cannot be used directly, though, because there is no
underlying crystalline substrate to deﬁne a reference distribution. Neither is a homogeneous space appropriate, since
the density of consumers is not uniform and some town areas cannot host stores, as is clearly seen in the blank spaces
of the map (due to the presence of rivers, parks, or residential spaces deﬁned by town regulations).

A clever idea proposed by G. Duranton and H. G. Overman [3] is to take as reference a random distribution of stores
located on the array of all existing sites (black dots in Fig. 1). This is the best way to take into account automatically
the geographical peculiarities of each town. I then use the “M” index [4] to quantify the spatial interactions between
categories of stores. The deﬁnition of MAB at a given distance r is straightforward : draw a disk of radius r around
each store of category A, count the total number of stores (ntot), the number of B stores (nB) and compare the
ratio nB/ntot to the average ratio NB/Ntot where capital N refer to the total number of stores in town. If this ratio,
averaged over all A stores, is larger than 1, this means that A “attracts” B, otherwise that there is repulsion between
these two activities [5]. To ascertain the statistical signiﬁcance of the repulsion or attraction, I have simulated 800
random distributions of nB stores on all possible sites, calculating for each distribution the nB/ntot ratio around the
same A locations. This gives the statistical ﬂuctuations and allows to calculate how many times the random ratio
deviates from 1 as much as the real one. I assume that if there are less than 3% random runs that deviate more than
the real one, the result is signiﬁcant (97% conﬁdence interval). I have chosen r = 100m as this represents a typical

distance a customer accepts to walk to visit diﬀerent stores [6]

I can now deﬁne a network structure of retail stores. Nodes are deﬁned as the 55 retail activities (Table I). The
weighted [7] links are given by aAB ≡ log(MAB), which reveal the spatial attraction or repulsion between activities
A and B [8]. This retail network represents the ﬁrst a social network with quantiﬁed “anti-links”, i.e. repulsive links
between nodes [9]. The anti-links add to the usual (positive) links and to the absence of any signiﬁcant link, forming
an essential part of the network. If only positive links are used, the analysis leads to diﬀerent results, which are less
satisfactory (see below).

To divide the store network into communities, I adapt the “Potts” algorithm [10]. This algorithm identiﬁes the store
types as magnetic spins and groups them in several homogeneous magnetic domains to minimize the system energy.
Anti-links can then be interpreted as anti-ferromagnetic interactions between the spins. Therefore, this algorithm
naturally groups the activities that attract each other, and places trades that repel into diﬀerent groups. A natural
deﬁnition [10, 11] of the satisfaction (−1 ≤ si ≤ 1) of site i to belong to group σi is :

si ≡ Pj6=i aijπσi σj
Pj6=i |aij|

K ≡ X

aijπσiσj

i,j=1,55;i6=j

where πσiσj ≡ 1 if σi = σj and πσiσj ≡ −1 if σi 6= σj .
To obtain the group structure, I run a standard simulated annealing algorithm [12] to maximize the overall site

satisfaction (without the normalizing denominator) :

Pott’s algorithm divides the retail store network into ﬁve homogeneous groups (Table I, note that the number of
groups is not ﬁxed in advance but a variable of the maximisation). This group division reaches a global satisfaction
of 80% of the maximum K value and captures more than 90% of positive interactions inside groups. Except for
[11]. This means that
one category (“Repair of shoes”), our groups are communities in the strong sense of Ref.
the grouping achieves a positive satisfaction for every element of the group. This is remarkable since hundreds of
“frustrated” triplets exist [13]. Taking into account only the positive links and using the modularity algorithm [14]
leads to two large communities, whose commercial interpretation is less clear.

Two arguments ascertain the commercial relevance of this classiﬁcation. First, the grouping closely follows the usual
categories deﬁned in commercial classiﬁcations, as the U.S. Department of Labor Standard Industrial Classiﬁcation
System [15] (see Table I). It is remarkable that, starting exclusively from location data, one can recover most of such
a signiﬁcant commercial structure. Such a signiﬁcant classiﬁcation has also been found for Brussels and Marseilles
stores (to be presented elsewhere), suggesting the universality of the classiﬁcation for European towns. There are only
a few exceptions, mostly non-food proximity stores which belong to the “Food store” group or vice-versa. Second,
the diﬀerent groups are homogeneous in relation to correlation with population density. The majority of stores from
groups 1 and 2 (18 out of 26) locate according to population density, while most of the remaining stores (22 out of 29)
ignore this characteristic [16]. Exceptions can be explained by the small number of stores or the strong heterogeneities
[17] of those activities.

From interactions to location niches

Thanks to the quantiﬁcation of retail store interactions, we can construct a mathematical index to automatically
detect promising locations for retail stores. The basic idea is that a location that resembles the average location of the
actual bakeries might well be a good location for a new bakery. To characterize the average environment of activity i,
we use the average number of neighbor stores (inside a circle of radius 100 m) of all the activities j, thus obtaining the
list of average neiij. We then use the network matrix aij to quantify deviations from this average. For example, if an
environment lacks a bakery (or other shops that are usually repelled by bakeries), this should increase the suitability
of that location. We then calculate the quality Qi(x, y) of an environment around (x,y) for an activity i as :

Qi(x, y) ≡ X
j=1,55

aij(neiij(x, y) − neiij)

(3)

where neiij(x, y) represents the number of neighbor stores around x,y. To calculate the location quality for an

existing store, one removes it from town and calculates Q at its location.

3

As often in social contexts, it is diﬃcult to test empirically the relevance of our quality index. In principle, one
should open several bakeries at diﬀerent locations and test whether those located at the “best” places (as deﬁned
by Q) are on average more successful. Since it may be diﬃcult to fund this kind of experiment, I use location data
from two years, 2003 and 2005. It turns out (Fig. 2) that bakeries closed between these two years are located on
signiﬁcantly lower quality sites. Inversely, new bakeries (not present in the 2003 database) do locate preferently on
better places than a random choice would dictate. This stresses the importance of location for bakeries, and the
relevance of the quality here deﬁned to quantify the interest of each possible site. Possibly, the correlation would be
less satisfactory for retail activities whose locations are not so critical for commercial success. Practical applications
of Q are under development together with Lyon’s Chamber of Commerce and Industry : advice to newcommers on
good locations, advice to city mayor’s on improving commercial opportunities on speciﬁc town sectors.

This study shows that, through locations, the retail world is now accessible to physicists. This opens many research
directions, such as : are there optimum store distributions, whose overall quality is higher than the actual one? Can
one deﬁne store-store interaction ”potentials” by analogy with those used for atomic species? Moreover, new tools
are needed to describe networks containing anti-links, starting with a basic one : “how to deﬁne a node degree?”.

Table I Retail store groups obtained from Pott’s algorithm. Our groups closely match the categories of the U.S.
Department of Labor Standard Industrial Classiﬁcation (SIC) System : group 1 corresponds to Personal Services, 2
to Food stores, 3 to Home Furniture, 4 to Apparel and Accessory Stores and 5 to Used Merchandise Stores. The
columns correspond to : group number, activity name, satisfaction, activity concentration (see below), median
distance travelled by costumers, correlation with population density (U stands for uncorrelated, P for Population
correlated) and ﬁnally number of stores of that activity in Lyon. The activity concentration csame represents the
number of stores located nearer than 100 m from another similar store, normalized to the number expected from a
random distribution. For space reasons, only activities with more than 50 stores are shown.

[5] One could argue that the average is dominated by the denser regions, thus eliminating the inﬂuence of peripheral areas.
This eﬀect exists, even if it is partially corrected through the ponderation by the total number of stores. I have tried several
other statistical representation of the relative concentration, such as the mode or the median, but none performed as well
as the average. The median, for example, fails because most A stores have no B stores around them, leading to mostly
null interaction coeﬃcients.

[6] Alternatively, one can fully count stores closer than 50 m and linearly decrease the counting coeﬃcient until 150 m. This

leads to similar results.

[7] Important diﬀerences introduced by including weighted links are stressed for example in M. Barthelemy, A. Barrat, R.

Pastor-Satorras and A. Vespignani, Physica A 346 34 (2005)

[8] For a pair interaction to be signiﬁcant, I demand that both aAB and aBA be diﬀerent from zero, to avoid artiﬁcial
correlations [4]. For Lyon’s city, I end up with 300 signiﬁcant interactions (roughly 10% of all possible interactions), of
which half are repulsive.

[9] While store-store attraction is easy to justify (the “market share” strategy, where stores gather in commercial poles, to
attract costumers), direct repulsion is generally limited to stores of the same trade which locate far from each other to
capture neighbor costumers (the “market power” strategy). The repulsion quantiﬁed here is induced (indirectly) by the
price of space (the sq. meter is too expensive downtown for car stores) or diﬀerent location strategies. For introductory
texts on retail organization ans its spatial analysis, see : B.J.L. Berry et al. Market Centers and Retail Location: Theory

ensures that the ground-state is not the homogeneous one, when all spins point into the same direction (i.e. all nodes
belong to the same cluster). Then, there is no need then of a γ coeﬃcient here.

(a) The 19 bakeries that closed between 2003 and 2005 had an average quality of −2.2 x 10
of all bakeries (4.6 x 10−3), the diﬀerence being signifcative with probability 0.997). Taking into account the small number of
closed bakeries and the importance of many other factors in the closing decision (family problems, bad management...), the
sensitivity of the quality index is remarkable. (b) Concerning the 80 new bakeries in the 2005 database (20 truly new, the

Introduction to Econometrics, Addison-Wesley, 2003) the hypothesis that store and population densities are uncorrelated
(zero slope of the least squares ﬁt), with a conﬁdence interval of 80%.

[17] Several retail categories deﬁned by the Commerce Chamber are unfortunately heterogeneous : for example, “Meat” refers
to the proximity butcher stores, but also to a big commercial pole of casher butchers who attract costumers from far away
towns. “Bookstores and newspapers” refers to big stores selling books and CDs as well as to the proximity newspaper
stand. Instead, bakeries are precisely classiﬁed in 4 diﬀerent categories : it is a French commercial structure!

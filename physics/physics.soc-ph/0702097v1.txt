We introduce and analyze a model of a multi-directed Eulerian network, that is a directed and
weighted network where a path exists that passes through all the edges of the network once and only
once. Networks of this type can be used to describe information networks such as human language
or DNA chains. We are able to calculate the strength and degree distribution in this network and
ﬁnd that they both exhibit a power law with an exponent between 2 and 3. We then analyze the
behavior of the accelerated version of the model and ﬁnd that the strength distribution has a double
slope power law behavior. Finally we introduce a non-Eulerian version of the model and ﬁnd that
the statistical topological properties remain unchanged. Our analytical results are compared with
numerical simulations.

INTRODUCTION.

Many naturally occurring systems appear as chains of repeated elements. Such systems, such as human language,
DNA chains, etc.., often encode and transport information. Markov processes have been adopted to model those
chains[11]. Unfortunately Markov chains are not able to describe long range correlations that exist within these
structures. Thus complex growing networks appear to be a more suitable modeling tool.

In this paper we study written human language as a complex growing network. Since the discovery by Zipf [12]
that language exhibits a complex behavior, and the application of Simon’s theories[10] to growing networks[1], this
topic has been examined by a number of scientists [6, 7, 9, 13].

A useful way to build a network from a text is to associate a vertex to each sign of the text, that is both words
and punctuation, and to put a link between two vertices if they are adjacent in the text. In a previous paper [8]
we showed that it is necessary to consider a directed and weighted network to understand the topological properties
of this language network, in which the weight of each link in the network represents the number of directed links
connecting two vertices.

When networks are built in this way, from a chain of repeated elements, an adjacency matrix is obtained that is well
known graph in graph theory: the Eulerian graph[4]. Eulerian means that there exists a path in the graph passing
through all the links of the network once and only once.

In order to describe the evolution of a multi-directed graph we need to introduce the formalism of weighted
networks[2, 3]. These are characterized by a weighted adjacency matrix W = {wij} whose elements wij represent the
number of directed links connecting vertex i to vertex j. We deﬁne the degree kout/in
of vertex i as the number of
out/in-nearest neighbours of vertex i and we have kout/in
2 ). We deﬁne the out/in-strength sout/in
j Θ(wij/ji − 1
of vertex i as the number of outgoing/incoming links of vertex i, that is sout/in
j wij/ji. Analytically the Eulerian
=
i
i = sout
condition means that the graph must be connected and it must have sin

for every i.
P

In this work we ﬁrst develop and analyze a model for a general multi-directed Eulerian growing network. Then,
since human language is an accelerated growing network,we extend our model to its accelerated version, and ﬁnd
results similar to those in [6]. To conclude we introduce and analyze the non-Eulerian version of our model. This
last step allows us to build a directed network without initial vertex attractiveness. As far as we are aware, this is
the ﬁrst time a model for directed networks has been proposed without the help of this artiﬁce. The resulting power
laws exponents, tunable between 2 and 3, are very interesting since they ﬁt with those found within most of the real
networks[1, 5].

II. MODEL A

First we introduce a model for the multi-directed Eulerian growing network which we will call M odelA. The
Eulerian condition (hereafter EC) states that every newly introduced edge has to join the last connected vertex, so
that every newly introduced in-link implies a constrained out-link from the last connected vertex. This implies that
sin
i =

, for every i, with the global constraint the network must be connected (Fig.1).

FIG. 1: Growth mechanism for model A with m = 1. Dashed grey arrows represent m + 2 newly introduced edges.

We start with a chain of 2m connected vertices. At each time step we create a new vertex and m + 2 new directed

edges (Fig.1). At each time step

a- The new vertex will acquire one in-link with the constraint the network must respect the EC.
b- The remaining m + 1 in-link will be attached to old vertices with probability proportional to their in-strength

with the constraint the network must respect the EC.

To calculate the strength distribution for the model, we use the fact that with the EC the in-strength will be exactly
the same as the out-strength distribution. We write the equation for the strength evolution s(t, ti) at time t for the
vertex born at time ti as:

The right hand side of the last equation takes into account that m + 1 vertices acquire a link with probabil-
P si . Considering that the total number of in/out-links at time t is

ity proportional to their normalized strength si

i s(t, ti) = (m + 2)t and integrating Eq.1 with the initial condition s(ti, ti) = 1 we obtain

P

Using the fact that

from Eq.2 we obtain:

which is a stationary power-law distribution with exponent between 2 and 3. In particular it will be 3 for m = 0, and
it will tend to 2 for increasing values of m.

In order to calculate the degree distribution we consider that each time the strength of a vertex increases by 1,
the degree of the vertex increases if and only if the vertex links with a new neighbor. This process implies higher
order correlations. We will approximate this process as an uncorrelated one and compare our results with simulations.
Hence the equation governing the evolution of the degree is

To understand this equation we have to notice that the degree of a vertex grows at a rate proportional to its
normalized strength, as in Eq.2, but, when the strength of a vertex increases by 1, the probability that the degree of
the vertex i increases by 1 is (1 − k(t, ti)/t). In fact k(t, ti) is the number of nearest neighbors of vertex i, while t
represents the total number of vertices at time t. Note that for m = 0, k(t, ti) = s(t, ti) as we would expect.

We substitute Eq.2 in Eq.5 and we integrate it to obtain

where Γ(a, b) is the incomplete Gamma function and C is an integration constant to be determined by the initial

FIG. 2: Results from a 50000 vertices simulation for model A for diﬀerent values of m. On the left the strength distribution
is compared with Eq.4. On the right the degree distribution is compared with Eq.8. Simulation results are points while lines
represent the analytical results.

To check Eq.6 we integrated it for diﬀerent values of m and ﬁxed t. This integral represents the number of occupied
cells of the adjacency matrix and can be compared with results obtained by simulations. The results are shown in
Fig.3. As we can see the uncorrelated approximation is very good for small values of m, but it fails to reproduce the
behavior of the system for larger values of m, when correlations are stronger.

III. MODEL B

In this section we build and analyze a multi-directed accelerated growing Eulerian network that is an accelerated
version of the previous model and we will call it M odelB. In order to do this we replace the constant addition of m
edges at each time step with a number of edges m′ that grows linearly with time, that is m′ = αt. In this way at
every time step we have an increasing number of edges added to the network. This extension of the previous model
is designed to get closer to the topology of real language networks, as they display an accelerated evolution[6].

Keeping this in mind we can describe our modiﬁed model. We start with a chain of some connected vertices. At

each time step we create a new vertex and αt + 2 new directed edges (Fig.1). In particular at each time step

a- The new vertex will acquire one in-link with the constraint the network must follow EC.
b- The remaining αt + 1 in-links will be attached to old vertices with a probability proportional to their in-strength

with the constraint the network must follow EC.

IV. MODEL C

To complete this work we introduce a non-Eulerian version of model A and we call it M odelC.
We start with 2m randomly connected vertices. At each time step we create a new vertex and m + 2 new directed

edges. In particular at each time step

a- The new vertex will acquire one in-link and one out-link.
b- The remaining m+ 1 out-links will be attached to old vertices with probability proportional to their out-strength.
c- The remaining m + 1 in-links will be attached to old vertices with probability proportional to their out-strength.
For this model the same equations apply as with the Eulerian Model A with the same arguments, so that it displays
equivalent topological properties, that is weight, strength and degree distributions. The main diﬀerence at this level
of observation is that in the Eulerian case sin = sout in an exact sense, while in this case this condition holds only on
average.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this work we contextualize phenomena that manifest as a continuous chain of repeated elements in a novel way,
within the framework of network theory. We show that such phenomena, such as human language, DNA chains,
etc.., are described by Eulerian graphs. Eulerian graph topology ensures that every newly connected vertex of the
network is connected to the last linked vertex. So we introduce and analyze diﬀerent kinds of growing networks built
to produce an Eulerian graph. We are able to ﬁnd the main topological properties for this kind of network and we
ﬁnd that the resulting exponents for the strength and degree distributions are compatible with those of real networks.
We then extend our model to a non-Eulerian one. This work is mainly focused on the analysis of written human
language, but it is also important for the study of directed and weighted growing networks. An important extension of
these models, that could be taken into consideration for further investigations, is the growth of a network governed by
local growing rules. We showed in a previous work[8] that local growing rules are important to reproduce interesting
features of human language and must be taken into account to generate a syntax-like structure.

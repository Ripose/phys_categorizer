Phase Transitions in Operational Risk

(Dated: September 22, 2013)

In this paper we explore the functional correlation approach to operational risk. We consider
networks with heterogeneous a-priori conditional and unconditional failure probability. In the limit
of sparse connectivity, self-consistent expressions for the dynamical evolution of order parameters
are obtained. Under equilibrium conditions, expressions for the stationary states are also obtained.
The consequences of the analytical theory developed are analyzed using phase diagrams. We ﬁnd
co-existence of operational and non-operational phases, much as in liquid-gas systems. Such systems
are susceptible to discontinuous phase transitions from the operational to non-operational phase via
catastrophic breakdown. We ﬁnd this feature to be robust against variation of the microscopic
modelling assumptions.

INTRODUCTION

Management and mitigation of risk events are major
concerns for banks. The goal is two-fold: ﬁrst, quantita-
tively assess the risk in terms of potential ﬁnancial loss
and second, develop solutions to control and buﬀer the
impact of these losses. To facilitate systematic analysis,
risk events are broadly classiﬁed into three categories: (i)
Market Risk (MR), (ii) Credit Risk (CR) and (iii) Op-
erational Risk (OR). MR refers to ﬂuctuations in stock
indices, changes in interest rates, foreign exchange pari-
ties or commodity (e.g., gold, oil, etc) prices. CR refers
to loan defaults when companies go bankrupt. Research
on understanding risk and developing sophisticated mod-
els has traditionally focused on MR and CR, while OR
was initially subsumed under “other”, non credit or mar-
ket risks. Subsequent spectacular catastrophes including
the bankruptcy of the Orange County municipality, Cali-
fornia, USA in 1994 [1] and the collapse of Baring Invest-
ment Bank, London, United Kingdom in 1995 [2], which
were neither attributed to MRs nor CRs, helped establish
OR as a risk category of its own. The Basel Committee
for Banking Supervision (BCBS), an international reg-
ulatory body, now stipulates that banks must explicitly
reserve a portion of equity capital against OR.

The Basel II document [3], released by BCBS in 2001
and revised in 2005, is a guideline on banking regulation.
Under Basel II, OR is deﬁned as the risk of losses result-
ing from inadequate or failed internal processes, people
and systems, or from external events. From a practical
and management perspective it is reasonable to catego-
rize ORs as events based on causes and speciﬁc eﬀects.
Possible categorizations, as described in [4], are: (i) hu-
man processing errors, (ii) human decision errors, (iii)
system (software or hardware) errors, (iv) process design
errors, (v) fraud and theft and (vi) external damages.

To quantify the capital that must be allocated for oper-
ational failures, Basel II suggests three methodologies: (i)
Basic Indicator Approach (BIA), (ii) Standardized Ap-
proach (SA) and (iii) Advanced Measurement Approach
(AMA). Under BIA, the required capital is determined
by taking 15% of the banks’ average gross income over
the previous three years. The SA is only slightly more
advanced in that the banks’ operations are divided into
8 business lines, each of which has a speciﬁc weight. The
required capital is calculated as the weighted average of
the (non-negative) gross income from the business lines
over the previous three years. Under AMA, banks are re-
sponsible for designing their own measurement approach
and setting assumptions on the loss distribution. How-
ever, banks must demonstrate that their approach cap-
tures potentially severe “tail” loss events. The use of ex-
ternal and internal loss data as well as internal expertise
is permitted in the evaluation.

Under AMA, the Loss Distribution Approach (LDA) is
a sophisticated and popular measure. Herein the required
capital is determined by the Value-at-Risk (VaR) [2] over
all OR categories. VaR is deﬁned, over a speciﬁed risk
horizon T as the loss not exceeded with probability q, in
excess of the expected loss that can happen under normal
economic conditions. The VaR is thus dependent on the
nature of the loss frequency and severity distributions.

Choices for the loss severity distribution function in-
clude log-normal, Gamma, Beta and Weibull distribu-
tions. A Poisson or negative binomial distribution is of-
ten used for the loss frequency distribution. The common
approach to estimate the loss distribution is to ﬁrst as-
sume that OR categories are independent. Subsequently,
for each category i, one draws a realization Ni from the
loss frequency distribution and samples Ni realizations
of the loss severity X m
i (m = 1, . . . , Ni). The loss is then
calculated as

Ni

Li =

X m
i

.

(1)

m=1
X
Finally, drawing a histogram of outcomes of normalized
Li one obtains the loss distribution for each category.

The capital to be allocated is the VaR of the sum of losses
over all categories, given a time horizon T and conﬁdence
level q.

Subsequent developments in modelling OR have fo-
cused on incorporating more realistic loss frequency and
severity distributions. In [5] Chernobai and Rachev pro-
vide evidence in favor of using Stable Paretian Distri-
butions. Similarly, in [6] Allen et. al., incorporate a
Generalized Pareto Distribution.

A critical point concerning LDA and subsequent an-
alytical development is the assumption of independence
between various OR categories. However, a moment’s re-
ﬂection will lead us to realize that these categories, which
may be conceptualized as sets of processes, are function-
ally dependent.

To put this in context we illustrate it with the collapse
of Baring Investment Bank. A trader in the banks’ Singa-
pore oﬃce hid trading losses by forging oﬃcial documents
(trading decision errors resulting in fraud), thereby al-
lowing discrepancies to go un-noticed by higher oﬃcials.
Pleased with his apparent performance, the bank made
a mistake of retaining him as Chief Trader (process de-
sign error in light of the bank not having adequate checks
and balances, which led to decision errors by the banks’
managers). In December 1994, compounded by increas-
ing losses and in order to overcome the predicament, the
trader bet on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, assuming that
the index would not fall below 19,000. However, in Jan-
uary 1995 a devastating earthquake hit the Japanese city
of Kobe, resulting in the index to plummet by 7% in one
week, and below 19,000 (series of decision errors com-
pounded by external damage). By the time the bank
discovered what had happened, the trader had lost $1.3
billion, eﬀectively bankrupting the bank.

This example shows that the assumption of indepen-
dence between processes is not realistic. Recent eﬀorts
have therefore been directed to capture the inﬂuence of
interactions between processes. A model based on the
lattice gas analogy was proposed in [7].
Investigations
were conducted via Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and
using a mean-ﬁeld approximation for a homogeneous and
fully connected process network. The model parameters
were shown to be related to both conditional and uncon-
ditional failure probabilities. Furthermore, avalanches of
process failures were shown to be possible through bubble
nucleation as in ﬁrst order phase transition. This model
was subsequently elaborated by Leipold and Vanini [8].
In [9], Clemente and Ramano present a case study, sub-
stantiated by MC simulations, incorporating realistic de-
pendences between processes.

At this point, it is important to note that the concept
of OR is not restricted to the banking industry, but is
also systemic to any large economy or commerce. Over
the past few decades, markets have been subject to con-
siderable de-regulation and globalization. These forces,
coupled with an increasing reliance on sophisticated in-
formation technology have allowed businesses to develop
more eﬃcient operational practices, which include Busi-

2

ness Processes Outsourcing (BPO) and automated data
collection, storage and retrieval techniques. These ad-
vances have led to increased mutual dependencies be-
tween economic processes, resulting in a heightened sus-
ceptibility for catastrophic breakdowns and thus signif-
icant ﬁnancial losses. A through understanding of the
dynamics of interacting process networks is more than
ever desirable.

Therefore, in consideration of the above, the aim of the
present paper is twofold: (i) provide detailed analytical
underpinning for the main ﬁndings of [7], and (ii) in doing
so, broaden the scope of that investigation to highlight
the fact that the possibility of catastrophic breakdown in
networks of interacting processes is a robust phenomenon
under variation of the underlying model assumptions.

Sec.

In Sec.

II we introduce our model.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.
In Sec.
III be-
gins by introducing three distinct techniques, covering
non-equilibrium dynamics and equilibrium statistical me-
chanics, which we use to derive dynamical evolution and
stationary state solutions.
III A we detail a
heuristic solution, valid in the case of asymmetric, un-
correlated interactions between processes. In Sec. III B
a more systematic study, based on a Generating Func-
tional Analysis (GFA) and valid for an arbitrary degree
of interaction symmetry is provided.
III C we
investigate the stationary behavior of a fully symmet-
ric network using techniques from equilibrium statistical
mechanics. In Sec. IV we produce phase diagrams for
process networks, exhibiting regions in parameter space
where operational phases coexist with non-operational
phases. We subsequently evaluate a loss distribution and
thereby extend the scope of LDA to account for correla-
tions between processes. Finally, in Sec. V we provide
concluding remarks and describe possible extensions for
further work. Some of the more technical details from
GFA and analysis of stationary states are relegated to
appendices A and B, respectively.

II. MODEL DEFINITIONS

In this section we describe the statistical model of in-
teracting processes, which was previously introduced in
[7]. Each process i (i = 1, . . . N ) is deﬁned by its state
at time t, which is referred to as ηi(t). A two-state model
is considered: ηi(t)
. At time t a process can
}
be either up and running, ηi(t) = 0, or broken down,
ηi(t) = 1. In order to maintain a stable running state
over the time increment t
t + 1, each process i needs
→
to receive support at time t, which is denoted Ui(t) and
takes the form

∈ {

0, 1

Ui(t) = ϑi

Jij ηj(t)

ξi(t) .

breaks down. Finally, the ξi(t) are zero mean, Gaussian
random ﬂuctuations, which represent non-systematic in-
ternal and external perturbations to the environment
(e.g., ﬁre, earthquake, voltage ﬂuctuations within elec-
tric supplies, etc.).

A process breaks down in the next time step if Ui(t) <

0. Thus, the dynamics of a processes’ state is given by

ηi(t + 1) = Θ

Jij ηj(t)

ϑi + ξi(t)

where Θ(. . .) represents the Heaviside function. The
time-step, is taken to represent one day.

By suitable rescaling of the average support and im-
pact parameters ϑi and Jij, respectively, the ξi(t) can
be taken to have unit variance. The rescaled variables,
can then be related to the unconditional and conditional
failure probabilities. Consider a situation wherein all pro-
cesses are working at time-step t. The probability that
process i will breakdown in next step, referred to as pi,
is given by integrating Eq. (3) over the noise ξi(t). Thus

pi = Φ (

ϑi) ,

In general, this model is not analytically tractable. In
[7] investigations were conducted via MC simulations and
using a mean-ﬁeld approximation for a homogeneously
connected network with uniform conditional and uncon-
ditional failure probabilities. In what follows, we study
and solve the model in a more interesting regime where
conditional and unconditional failure probabilities are
heterogeneous across the system.

We begin by noting that if Jij < 0, the breakdown
of process j adds support and is beneﬁcial to process i,
i.e., the two processes are competing. Such a situation
is undesirable, but tends to occur on a small scale in
large organizations. Thus, when considering a primarily
cooperative environment, it is desireable to have, with
high probability, Jij > 0.

In our framework, each process does not interact with
all, but instead a fraction of the other processes. We
explicitly incorporate this feature by decomposing

Jij = cij ˜Jij ,

(7)

where cij
˜Jij

are connectivity coeﬃcients and
R describes the magnitude of impact. We assume

}

∈

cij = cji. While this is a reasonable assumption, it is
important to realize that the impact magnitudes are not
necessarily symmetric. For example, consider a main-
frame computer connected to a dummy terminal com-
puter. If the main-frame crashes, we cannot use the ter-
minal. However, if the terminal computer breaks down,
it is highly unlikely that it would eﬀect the operations
of the main-frame. Thus, in general, ˜Jij
= ˜Jji. The
connectivity coeﬃcients are described by the following
distribution

has important implications on the structure of the con-
nectivity graph. Firstly, each node in the graph will be
connected to a vanishing fraction of the total number of

Thus, taking N

of ﬁnite length tends to 0. The environment about each

age, supportive, which is the regime of interest. Secondly
small J suppresses the probability of having of negative
˜Jij. In addition, small J reduces the eﬀects of frustra-
tion [12]. Finally, we choose the xij to be independent in

III. MODEL SOLUTIONS

Here we investigate the dynamics and the stationary

states of the model introduced in Sec. II.

For uncorrelated interactions, i.e., α = 0, a solution
can be obtained by a heuristic argument, following lines
of reasoning previously used to study statistical mechan-
ics of disordered systems, in particular neural networks

6
[11]-[13]. This solution relies on assuming weak and neg-
ligible correlations between the quenched and dynamic
random variables, which cannot be easily justiﬁed in a
rigorous manner.

A more exact and formal treatment of the dynamics is
possible using generating functional analysis (GFA) [14].
This technique facilitates the evaluation of order parame-
ters ab initio and is applicable for arbitrary degree of cor-
relation, α, between processes. In addition, it provides
a non-trivial check to show that the heuristic solution is
exact.

Finally, for fully symmetric networks, α = 1, we study
the stationary states using techniques from equilibrium
statistical mechanics. This requires the use of thermal
instead of Gaussian noise.

A. Heuristic Solution

We begin by observing that interactions of process i
j cij ˜Jij ηj(t).
are described by the local ﬁeld hi(t) =
The state ηi(t + 1) depends on the ηj (t) that contribute
to hi(t). Furthermore, the states ηj(t) depend on ηi(t
1)
1). There is feed-back in the system, which
through hj(t
induces correlations between the local ﬁelds at time t.

P

−

In the present mean-ﬁeld approach we evaluate the
statistics of hi(t) by appealing to the law of large num-
bers and central limit theorem. The applicability of these
tools relies on assuming that the contributions to hi(t)
are weakly correlated if not independent. The condition
α = 0 together with the limit of sparse connectivity,
c/N
0, entail that contributions to hi(t) are uncorre-
lated at ﬁnite times. This allows us to describe hi(t) as
a Gaussian random quantity.

→

Concentrating on the local ﬁeld hi(t), we incorporate
the deﬁnition of Jij given by Eq. (9) to rewrite the ex-
pression as

hi(t) =

cij xij ηj(t) .

In the limit N
, Eq. (14) can be evaluated by ap-
pealing to the law of large numbers as a sum of averages
over the random variables hj(t), ξj(t) and ϑj. As hj(t)
and ξj(t) are Gaussian random variables, their sum is also
Gaussian, with mean J0 m(t) and variance 1 + J 2 m(t).
Thus, ﬁrst performing the joint average over local ﬁelds
and noise, we obtain

We have thus obtained a simple closed expression for

work.

B. Generating Functional Analysis

Investigations of the dynamical properties of a system
are conducted systematically employing GFA [14], which
provides tools for the evaluation of correlation and re-
sponse functions in terms of a characteristic functional
of path-probabilities. Performing the average over bond
disorder in the sum over dynamical trajectories, one ob-
tains a family of eﬀective single site processes parameter-
ized by ϑ,

respectively, [11]. The angled brackets

namics of the fraction of failed processes.

In the case α = 0, we recover Eq. (16), which was de-
rived via purely heuristic reasoning in Sec. III A. How-
ever, for arbitrary α, the response function complicates
averaging over
. In these cases, numerical results
(19)-(21) are obtained using Eissfeller-Opper
for Eqs.
(EO) simulations [15]. A key concern in performing the
simulations is producing colored noise. Our method uses
a Cholskey decomposition [16] of the noise covariance ma-
trix. We construct colored noise as a linear combination
of white noises weighted with elements of the Cholskey
matrix.

C. Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics

A process network of the form described in Sec. II is
guaranteed to achieve a stationary probability distribu-
tion for its microscopic states, if we assume α = 1 and
use thermal noise, distributed according to

p(ξ) =

instead of Gaussian noise, as in Eq. (3). The parameter β
is called the inverse temperature. The Gibbs-Boltzmann

nian,

A solution of this model, with disorder variables ϑi,

In this spirit, the Replica-

is positive. We found that for networks with parameter
settings as investigated in section IV below, i.e., a-priori
homogeneous failure probability, p = 0.01, RSB occurs
only for J & 4.630. Hence, the regime of interest with
small frustration, say J < 0.5, is well within the stable
domain.

Comparison between the equilibrium m, Eqs.

(24)-
(27), and the long-term stationary behavior of m(t), Eq.
(19), with α = 1 is possible, once we scale the ther-
mal noise appropriately to match properties of the Gaus-
sian noise. In principle, such a matching may be accom-
plished in several diﬀerent manners, each of which leads
to similar results. Here, we prescribe that the thermal
noise should have the same unit variance as the Gaus-
sian noise used in the microscopic dynamics. This leads
to β = π/√3.

IV. RESULTS

In this section we explore the consequences of theory
developed above, with particular emphasis on phase dia-
grams of resulting stationary states.

For simplicity, we assume homogeneous ϑ, which al-
lows us to drop the corresponding ϑ-averages. We justify
this simpliﬁcation by noting that any other non-trivial
ϑ-distribution, for example Gaussian with mean ϑ and
variance σ2
ϑ, would not alter the qualitative behavior of
the observables. We illustrate this for the fully asym-
metric network, α = 0. To evaluate Eq. (14) we exploit
that the sum of Gaussian terms, hj(t)
ϑj + ξj(t), is
itself a Gaussian with mean J0 m(t)
ϑ and variance
1 + J 2 m(t) + σ2

ϑ. This gives

Up to a shift in the variance of the noise, this equation de-

pled processes with uniform ϑi = ϑ.

For stationary states for the fully symmetric network,
α = 1, obtained from equilibrium statistical mechanics,
a similar structural shift can be shown to apply.

Assuming long-term stationary behavior for the ob-
servable m(t), Eq. (16), we drop the time index. The
curve in the top panel of Fig. 1 depicts m as a function of
J0. We note the coexistence of a low-m operational and
a high-m non-operational phase for J0 values bounded
by the lower and upper critical values, J c
3.971 and
J c
14.814, respectively. Within this interval there
0 ≈
is an unstable branch of solutions, with intermediate
m-values, represented by the back-bending part of the
curve.

0 ≈

The behavior is parameterized by the unconditional
failure probability p. This dependence is made explicit
in the phase diagram, shown in the lower panel of Fig.
1. The upper curve marks the J c
0 -boundary of the low-
m operational phase, while the lower curve represents
the J c
0 -bound of the high-m non-operational phase. A
transition between the two phases is discontinuous for
p < pc
0.102 and becomes continuous exactly at pc.
Beyond pc the phases loose their separate identity, much
as in a liquid-gas system. In the region of small J, which
is of interest for OR, say J < 0.5, the behavior shown in
Fig. 1 is fairly insensitive to variation in J.

B. Partially Symmetric Network

Investigations of partially symmetric networks were
conducted via: (i) evaluating the ﬁrst three time-steps of
the eﬀective single site dynamics exactly, starting with
random initial conditions, given by m(0), and (ii) con-
ducting EO simulations of the dynamics to higher time-
steps.

The results presented in Fig. 2, were produced for an
intermediate value of the symmetry parameter α = 0.5.
The exact evaluation of the ﬁrst three time-steps is de-
picted in the top panel. The curves represent the fraction
of failed processes at each time as a function of J0. We
observe that these curves intersect the line m(0) = 0.3
at exactly the same point, J T
6.001, which marks a
0 ≈
change in behavior. For J0 < J T
0 , a convergence to the
low-m operational phase is realized, while for J0 > J T
0 ,
we observe convergence to the high-m non-operational
phase. Except in the immediate vicinity of J T
0 , the con-
vergence is rapid and achieved within the ﬁrst three time-
steps.

To investigate the behavior beyond the ﬁrst three time-
steps, we used EO simulations to propagate Eqs. (17)-
(21) up to t = 30. This time horizon is suﬃcient to

intermediate J0, in complete analogy to the fully asym-
metric case. These J0 values are bounded between the
critical values, J c
3.966 and J c
14.513. Here, the
unstable branch, represented by the back-bending curve,
is computed by locating the J T
0 values that separate the
regions of convergence towards either the operational or
non-operational phase. It is noteworthy that we obtain
an almost identical unstable branch if we use the exact
forms of the ﬁrst three time-steps.

C. Fully Symmetric Network

Investigations of fully symmetric networks, α = 1, were
conducted via: (i) appealing to equilibrium statistical
mechanics, Eqs. (22) - (27), and (ii) EO simulations.

To compare the two results, we scaled the thermal

noise to have unit variance, resulting in β = π/√3.

a high-m non-operational phase, for intermediate values
of J0, is observed. The coexistence regions are given by
the intervals [4.113, 20.478] and [3.966, 14.512] for the
networks with thermal and Gaussian noise, respectively.
Whereas the critical values for the non-operational phase
are almost identical, a signiﬁcant discrepancy for the up-
per critical value is observed. This discrepancy must be
attributed to diﬀerences in the nature of the noises.

D. Loss Distribution

Finally, in Fig. 4 we show a loss distribution for a net-
work of 50 processes. The stationary macroscopic vari-
able m represents the fraction of failed processes. Al-
ternatively, m represents the probability that a process
breaks down within an interacting environment. That is,
eﬀects of functional correlations with other processes in
the network have been accounted. We proceed by draw-
ing from a binomial distribution, for each process i the
number ki of days in a year the process fails. The prob-
ability of failure on one day is given by m. Failures on
diﬀerent days are taken to be independent. Subsequently
binning the sum of ki realizations from the log-normal
loss severity distribution for each process, we obtain the
loss distribution for the network.

In the thermodynamic limit one would the loss distri-
bution to be a Gaussian by the central limit theorem.
However, for N = 50 the distribution is still heavily
skewed to the right with a “fat” tail and rare realizations
of extremely large losses.

V. CONCLUSION

In this paper we investigated networks of interacting
and functionally correlated processes as models of OR in
large organizations. In the limit of sparse connectivity,
we studied the dynamical evolution and stationary states
of these networks using analytical methods and numeri-
cal simulations. A heuristic approach was used to exactly
solve the dynamics of fully asymmetric networks. GFA
and EO simulations were used to study the dynamics of
partially and fully symmetric networks. Finally, station-
ary states for fully symmetric networks were analyzed
using techniques from equilibrium statistical mechanics.
The initial variant of our model was formulated on a
sparsely connected random graph, for which the aver-
0 in the
age connectivity per process c, satisﬁes, c/N
thermodynamic limit. However, it should be noted that
the assumption needed to carry through the GFA as de-
scribed in this paper is c
1 rather than sparseness.
≫
Hence, the analysis applies to networks with non-sparse
connectivity with c =

(N ) as well.
From all investigated cases, we found that there exists
a range of interactions, characterized by J0, for which an
operational phase coexists with a non-operational phase.
This raises the possibility of spontaneous catastrophic
breakdown in such process networks. We demonstrated
this feature is robust and invariant under a broad range
of changes in microscopic details.

O

Phase diagrams were produced for fully asymmetric
networks using the exact dynamical theory and for fully
symmetric networks using the results from equilibrium
statistical mechanics. Similar behavior is observed in
both cases. For suﬃciently small values of a-priori failure
probability p, the operational and non-operational phases
are distinct; a discontinuous transition between phases
can be induced, for instance, by changing J0. There is
a critical failure probability pc, where the transition is

continuous. We also note that the two critical values,
pc
0.110
for the fully symmetric case are very close.

Given parameter values p, J0 and J for which stable
operational and non-operational phases coexist, one can
further qualify these phases as either absolutely stable
or meta-stable. These notions are well known for ther-
modynamic equilibrium systems. Therein, the absolutely
stable phase is the one with the lower value of the free en-
ergy. Parameter values at which absolutely stable phases
become meta-stable (or vice-versa) are the locations of
proper ﬁrst-order equilibrium phase transitions.

→∞

→∞

Of the systems studied in this paper, however, only
the fully symmetric network with thermal noise can be
characterized as a thermodynamic equilibrium system.
Nevertheless, the notion of absolute stability and meta-
stability of coexisting dynamic stationary states can be
carried over to the other systems in the following man-
ner. One denotes by τN the fraction of the total time a
system of size N spends in one of the coexisting station-
ary states, either operational or non-operational. A state
is characterized as absolutely stable if limN
τN = 1
, and as meta-stable, if limN
τN = 0. A meta-stable
phase can nevertheless be dynamically stable in the sense
that, once in such a phase, a system will typically stay
in that phase for a very long time tN which diverges as
N

.
→ ∞
These concepts have a signiﬁcant implication for OR,
that play out for large (but ﬁnite) process networks that
exhibit dynamically and absolutely stable operational
phases, coexisting with a meta-stable non-operational
phases. Small changes of the parameters characterizing
the network, e.g. a slight increase in the average mutual
dependency among processes — described in our model
by a slight increase in J0 — could entail that the oper-
ational phase becomes meta-stable. In this case a catas-
trophic breakdown is bound to occur, even under normal
operating conditions. A small increase in J0 would re-
sult in a correspondingly small change in the statistical
properties of the network. As such, there would be no vis-
ible precursors for the transition. In other, more colorful
words, a small change in the design of a process network
could amount to inadvertently entering a gate carrying
the inscription “Lasciate ogni speranza, voi ch’entrate”
[19].

Of particular relevance in this context are a number of
current trends such as the advance of globalization, in-
creasing reliance on information technology, or the grow-
ing modularization of business and production processes,
including out-sourcing. Within our model these trends
roughly correspond to a trend of increasing J0; for a sta-
ble operational phase this is equivalent to a trend of push-
ing that phase towards meta-stability, hence eventually
towards guaranteed catastrophic breakdown.

A recent incident involving the retail bank HSBC out-
sourcing business processing highlights this issue [20].
The outsourced data included bank account passwords,
along with other sensitive information to an oﬃce in Ban-

galore, India. A widespread fraud, that took roots in
2002 and aﬀected one thousand of the banks’ clients was
uncovered earlier this year. While this did not critically
aﬀect the bank, its vulnerability has increased. The fact
that sensitive information was out-sourced to a single of-
ﬁce shifted the banks’ stable operational phase further
towards the meta-stability.

It is imperative that banks and other organizations as-
sess their stability, as described above, and check for the
possible coexistence of operational and non-operational
phases. As there are no detectable precursors for transi-
tions between them, the assessment must be performed
by stress tests, wherein artiﬁcial strains and ﬂuctuations
are introduced into the system and the eﬀects are mea-
sured. The present model readily lends itself to tests of
this type.

In our investigation, we only considered Poisson ran-
dom graphs with large average connectivity c. As a con-
sequence, there is little heterogeneity in the local envi-
ronment about each process. However, it is known that
realistic process networks exhibit a richer topology, which
includes the presence of “hubs”. In such situations, the
connectivity scales according to a power-law and the an-
alytical treatment would follow lines of reasoning used in
small-world networks [21]. A similar qualitative behav-
ior with coexistence of operational and non-operational
phases is nevertheless expected.

Thus, we have transformed the generating functional
into an integral with leading order in the exponential of

describes the response of the fraction of failed processes

We note the following: (i) There is now a dependence
on the fraction m(t) of failed processes.
(ii) If there
is a degree of symmetry, α
= 0, the dynamics is non-
Markovian, with memory given by the response function
= 0
G(t, s). (iii) The noise φ(t) is colored, with
and

We recall that the only i dependence in Eqs. (A16)-
(A17) comes from ϑi in fi(t), Eq. (A9). By the law of

However, for α

= 0, memory G(t, s) is relevant. The
non-linear nature of the evolution Eqs. (A19)-(A20) pre-
cludes a simple analytical characterization of the long-
time asymptotic stationary states.

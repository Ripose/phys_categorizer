Abstract: We consider a modiﬁcation of the voter model in which a set
of interacting elements (agents) can be in either of two equivalent states (A
or B) or in a third additional mixed AB state. The model is motivated by
studies of language competition dynamics, where the AB state is associated
with bilingualism. We study the ordering process and associated interface
and coarsening dynamics in regular lattices and small world networks. Agents
in the AB state deﬁne the interfaces, changing the interfacial noise driven
coarsening of the voter model to curvature driven coarsening. We argue that
this change in the coarsening mechanism is generic for perturbations of the
voter model dynamics. When interaction is through a small world network
the AB agents restore coarsening, eliminating the metastable states of the
voter model. The time to reach the absorbing state scales with system size
as τ ∼ ln N to be compared with the result τ ∼ N for the voter model in a
small world network.

1.INTRODUCTION

Understanding the complex collective behavior of many particle systems
in terms of a microscopic description based on the interaction rules among
the particles is the well established purpose of Statistical Physics. This
micro-macro paradigm [1] is also shared by Social Science studies based
on agent interactions (Agent Based Models).
In many cases parallel re-
search in both disciplines goes far beyond superﬁcial analogies. For example,
Schelling’s model [1] of residential segregation is mathematically equivalent
to the zero-temperature spin-exchange Kinetic Ising model with vacancies.
Cross-fertilization between these research ﬁelds opens interesting new topics
of research [2]. In this context the consensus problem is a general one of broad

1

interest: the question is to establish when the dynamics of a set of interact-
ing agents that can choose among several options leads to a consensus in one
of these options, or alternatively, when a state with several coexisting social
options prevails [3]. For an equilibrium system the analogy would be with an
order-disorder transition. For nonequilibrium dynamics we rely on ideas of
studies of domain growth and coarsening in the kinetics of phase transitions
[4], where dynamics is dominated by interface motion. Microscopic inter-
action rules include two ingredients that determine the ultimate fate of the
system, either homogenous consensus state or spatial coexistence of domains
of diﬀerent options. These ingredients are: i) the interaction mechanism be-
tween particles/agents, and ii) the network of interactions. Interactions in
complex networks is a relatively recent paradigm in statistical physics [5]. A
general still open question is the study of coarsening in complex networks
[6].

Language competition is a particular example of consensus problems that
motivates the present work. It refers to the dynamics of language use in a
multilingual social system due to individuals interacting in a social network.
Recent interest in this problem has been triggered by the model proposed
by Abrams and Strogatz (AS-model) [7] to account for data of extinction
of endangered languages [8]. Other diﬀerent problems of language dynamics
include those of language evolution (dynamics of language structure) and
language cognition (learning processes). Among these, semiotic dynamics,
considered in the context of the naming game [9], is also an example of
consensus problems. The seminal paper of Abrams and Strogatz [7], as well
as others along the same line [10, 11, 12], belong to the general class of mean-
ﬁeld population dynamics studies based on nonlinear ordinary diﬀerential
equations for the populations of speakers of diﬀerent languages. Other studies
implement microscopic agent-based-models with speakers of many or few
languages [13, 14, 15, 16] as reviewed in [17].

The microscopic version [16] of the AS-model for the competition of two
equivalent languages is equivalent to the voter model [18, 19, 20, 21, 22,
23]. The voter model is a prototype lattice spin-model of nonequilibrium
dynamics for which d = 2 is a critical dimension [20]: For regular lattices
with d > 2 coarsening does not occur and, in the thermodynamic limit, the
system does not reach one of the homogenous absorbing states (consensus
states). The same phenomenon occurs in complex networks of interaction
of eﬀective large dimensionality where a ﬁnite system gets trapped in long-
lived heterogeneous mestastable states [21, 22, 23]. From the point of view of

2

interaction mechanisms, the voter model is one of random imitation of a state
of a neighbor. A diﬀerent mechanism (for d > 1) of majority rule is the one
implemented in a zero-temperature spin-ﬂip kinetic Ising (SFKI) model [24].
Detailed comparative studies of the consequences of these two mechanisms
in diﬀerent interaction networks have been recently reported [25]. From the
point of view of coarsening and interface dynamics, a main diﬀerence is that,
in the voter model coarsening is driven by interfacial noise, while for a SFKI
coarsening is curvature driven with surface tension reduction.

The voter and SFKI models are two-option models (spin +1 and spin −1)
with two equivalent global attractors for the system. Kinetics of multi-option
models like Potts or clock models were addressed long ago [26]. More recently,
a related model proposed by Axelrod [27] has been studied in some detail [28,
29]. This is a multi-option model but, in general, its nonequilibrium dynamics
does not minimize a potential leading to a thermodynamic equilibrium state
like in traditional statistical physics [30]. On the other hand, the kinetics of
the simplest three-options models [31, 32, 33] has not been studied in great
detail.

We are here interested in the class of 3-state models for which two states
are equivalent (spin ±1, state A or B) and a third one is not (spin 0, state
AB). Diﬀerent dynamical microscopic rules can be implemented for such
choice of individual states, some of which can be regarded as constrained
voter-model dynamics [32]. The choice of dynamical rules in this paper is
dictated by our motivation of considering bilingual individuals in the compe-
tition dynamics of two languages [12, 13]. We will consider here two socially
equivalent languages. The possible state of the agents are speaking either of
these languages (A or B) or a third non-equivalent bilingual state (AB). In
the context of the consensus problem this introduces a special ingredient in
the sense that the options are not excluding: there is a possible state of the
agents (bilinguals) in which there is coexistence of two possible options. In a
more general framework, the problem addressed here is that of competition
or emergence of social norms [34] in the case where two norms can coexist at
the individual level.

In this paper, and building upon a proposal by Minett and Wang [13]
we study a microscopic model of language competition which reduces to the
microscopic AS-model [16] when bilingual agents are not taken into account.
Our presentation in the remaining sections of the paper is of general nature
for the abstract problem of ordering dynamics of a modiﬁed voter model in
which a third mixed AB state is allowed. We aim to explore possible mech-

3

anisms for the stabilization of two options coexistence, possible metastable
sates, and the role of AB states (bilingual individuals) and interaction net-
work (social structure) in these processes. To this end we analyze the growth
mechanisms of A or B spatial domains (monolingual domains), the dynamics
at the interfaces (linguistic borders), and the role of AB states (bilingual
individuals) in processes of domain growth. This is done in regular lattices
and in complex networks of interaction. Generally speaking, we ﬁnd that
allowing for the AB state (bilinguals) modiﬁes the nature and dynamics of
interfaces: agents in the AB state deﬁne thin interfaces and coarsening pro-
cesses change from voter-like dynamics to curvature driven dynamics. We
argue that this change of coarsening mechanism is generic for perturbations
of the voter model.

The outline of the paper is as follows: Section 2 describes our microscopic
model which is analyzed in a 2-dimensional regular lattice in Section 3. In
Section 4 we describe the dynamics of the model in a small world network
[35]. Section 5 contains a summary of our results.

2. A MODEL WITH TWO NON-EXCLUDING OPTIONS

We consider a model in which an agent i sits in a node within a network
of N individuals and has ki neighbours. It can be in three possible states:
A, agent choosing option A (using language A); B, agent choosing option B
(using language B); and AB, agent in a state of coexisting options (bilingual
agent using both languages, A and B). States A and B are equivalent states.
The state of an agent evolves according to the following rules: starting
from a given initial condition, at each iteration we choose one agent i at
random and we compute the local densities for each of the three communities
in the neighbourhood of node i, σi (i=A, B, AB). The agent changes state
according to the following transition probabilities proportional to the local
density of agents belonging to a community choosing a given option (σA +
σB + σAB = 1)[36]:

pA→AB =

σB,

pB→AB =

σA ;

pAB→B =

(1 − σA),

pAB→A =

(1 − σB).

Equation (1) gives the probabilities for an agent i to move away from
a single-option community, A or B, to the AB community. They are pro-

4

portional to the density of agents in the opposed single-option state in the
neighbourhood of i. On the other hand, equation (2) gives the probabilities
for an agent to move from the AB community towards the A or B communi-
ties. They are proportional to the local density of agents with the option to
be adopted, including those in the AB state (1 − σj = σi + σAB, i, j=A,B).
It is important to note that a change from state A to state B or vice versa,
always implies an intermediate step through the AB state. These dynamical
rules reﬂect the special character of the third AB-state as one of coexisting
options. They deﬁne a modiﬁcation of the two state voter model to account
for the AB state. For the voter model the transition probabilities are simply
pB→A = σA. These are equivalent to the adoption by
given by pA→B = σB,
the agents of the opinion of a randomly chosen neighbour. In our simulation
we use random asynchronous node update and a unit of time includes N
iterations so that each node has been updated on average once every time
step.

An analysis of the mean ﬁeld equations for this model shows the existence
of three ﬁxed points: two of them stable and equivalent, corresponding to
consensus in the state A or B; and another one unstable, with non-vanishing
values for the global densities of agents in the 3 states, A, B and AB. In
order to describe the microscopic ordering dynamics, in which we take into
account ﬁnite size eﬀects and the topology of the network of interactions, we
use as an order parameter an ensemble average interface density hρi. This is
deﬁned as the density of links joining nodes in the network in diﬀerent states
[20, 22]. For random initial conditions hρ(t = 0)i = 2/3. The decrease of hρi
towards the value ρ = 0 corresponding to an absorbing state describes the
coarsening process with growth of spatial domains in which agents are in the
same state.

3. COARSENING IN A REGULAR LATTICE

We ﬁrst consider the dynamics on a 2-dimensional regular lattice with
four neighbours per node. We start from random initial conditions: random
spatial distribution of 1/3 of the population in state A, 1/3 in state B and 1/3
in state AB. In Figure 1 we show the time evolution for a typical realization:
state A takes over the system, while the opposite option B disappears. On
the average consensus in either of the two equivalent states A or B is reached
with probability 1/2. We observe an early very fast decay of the interface

5

density and of the total density of agents in the state AB, ΣAB, followed by
a slower decay corresponding to the coarsening dynamical stage. This stage
lasts until a ﬁnite size ﬂuctuation makes one of the sates A or B dominate,
and the density of AB agents disappears together with the density of agents
in the option (A or B) that vanishes.

(i= A, B, AB), and the interface density, ρ. One realization in a population
of N = 400 agents. From top to bottom: ΣA, ΣB , ρ, ΣAB .

In Figure 2 we show the time evolution of the interface density and of
the total density of AB agents, averaged over diﬀerent realizations. For the
relaxation towards one of the absorbing states (dominance of either A or
B) both the average interface density and the average density of AB agents
decay following a power law with the same exponent, hρi ∼ hΣABi ∼ t−0.45.
This indicates that the evolution of the average density of the AB agents
is correlated with the interface dynamics. Several systems sizes are shown
in order to see the eﬀect of ﬁnite size ﬂuctuations. During the coarsening
stage describe by the power law behavior, spatial domains of the A and B
community are formed and grow in size. Eventually a ﬁnite size ﬂuctuation
occurs (as the one shown in Figure 1) so that the whole system is taken to an
absorbing state in which there is consensus in either the A or B option. The
time scale to reach the absorbing state can be estimated to scale as τ ∼ N 2

6

since at that time hρi ∼ 1/N. During the coarsening process spatial domains
of AB agents are never formed. Rather, during an early fast dynamics AB
agents place themselves in the boundaries between A and B domains. This
explains the ﬁnding that the density of AB agents follows the same power
law than the average density of interfaces. We have also checked the intrinsic
instability of an AB community: an initial AB domain disintegrates very fast
into smaller A and B domains, with AB agents just placed at the interfaces.
The role of third AB state is therefore identiﬁed as a mechanism to modify
the dynamics of the interface.

density of AB agents, < ΣAB >, for N = 3002 agents is also shown (ﬁlled
circles). Averaged over 100-1000 realizations depending on the system size.
Dashed line for reference: hρi ∼ t−0.45

Our result for the growth law of the characteristic length of a A or B
domain is compatible with the well known exponent 0.5 associated with do-
main growth driven by mean curvature and surface tension reduction ob-
served in SFKI models. However, systematic deviations from the exponent
0.5 are observed, which can be due to non trivial logarithmic corrections. In

7

3-dimensional lattices, we also ﬁnd an exponent close to 0.5 which substanti-
ates the claim that curvature reduction is the dominant mechanism at work.
Still, the model analyzed here is a modiﬁcation of the two state voter model
for which coarsening in a d = 2 square lattice occurs by a diﬀerent mecha-
nism, interfacial noise, such that hρi ∼ (ln t)−1 [20, 19]. For a ﬁnite system
the time to reach an absorbing state scales as τ ∼ N ln(N) [37, 16]. There-
fore, introduction of the AB state, in spite of the small number of agents
surviving in that state, implies a nontrivial modiﬁcation of the dynamics.
Indeed, in our simulations we observe the formation of well deﬁned inter-
faces between A and B domains, populated by AB agents, that evolve by a
curvature driven mechanism. On the qualitative side, the inclusion of the
AB agents gives rise to a much faster coarsening process but it also favors a
longer dynamical transient in which domains of the two competing options
coexist (larger lifetime time to reach the absorbing state for large ﬁxed N).
A natural question that these results pose is if the crossover from in-
terfacial noise dynamics of the voter model to curvature driven dynamics is
generic for any structural modiﬁcation of the voter model. To check this idea
we have considered the coarsening process in a 2-dimensional lattice in which
agents can choose between two excluding options (states A and B) and the
dynamics is as deﬁned above but with transition probabilities:

pA→B = σB − ǫ sin 2πσB,

pB→A = σA − ǫ sin 2πσA,

ǫ ≤

(3)

1
2π

The parameter ǫ measures the strength of the term that perturbs the
interaction rules of the voter model. This perturbation of the voter model
implies that the probability of changing option is no longer a linear function
of the density of neighbouring agents in the option to be adopted. With the
perturbation term chosen here there is a nonlinear reinforcing (of order ǫ) of
the eﬀect of the local majority: the probability to make the change A → B is
larger (smaller) than σB when σB > 1/2 (σB < 1/2). In particular, we note
that for ǫ 6= 0 , the conservation law of the ensemble average magnetization,
a characteristic symmetry of the voter model, is no longer fulﬁlled. For later
comparison we recall that in the zero-temperature SFKI the local majority
determines, with probability one, the change of option: pA→B = 1(0) if
σB > 1/2(σB < 1/2).

Our results for the exponent x in a power law ﬁtting hρi ∼ t−x for the
modiﬁed voter model deﬁned by eq. (3) [38] are shown in Fig. 3 for diﬀerent

8

values of ǫ [39]. For very small values of ǫ we observe an exponent x ∼ 0.1
compatible with the logarithmic decay (hρi ∼ (ln t)−1) of the voter model,
as obtained in [16]. However, for small, but signiﬁcant values of ǫ there is a
change to a value x ∼ 0.5 associated with curvature driven coarsening.

We conclude that a small arbitrary perturbation of the transition prob-
abilities of the voter model dynamics leads to a new interface dynamics,
equivalent to the one found in Section 2 by including a third state where
options are non-excluding. This indicates that voter model dynamics is very
sensitive to perturbations of its dynamical rules.

shown. The inset shows the dependence of the characteristic lifetime τ with
the rewiring parameter p. The dashed line corresponds to the power law ﬁt
τ ∼ p−0.76. Population of 1002 agents, averaged over 500 realizations.

In Figure 4 we show the evolution of the average interface density for
diﬀerent values of p. As for the regular lattice we also observe here a dynam-
ical stage of coarsening with a power law decrease of hρi followed by a fast
decay to the A or B absorbing caused by a ﬁnite size ﬂuctuation. During
the dynamical stage of coarsening, the A and B communities have similar
size, while the total density of AB agents is much smaller. In the range of
intermediate values of p properly corresponding to a small world network,
increasing the rewiring parameter p has two main eﬀects: i) the coarsening
process is notably slower; ii) the characteristic time of the dynamics τ , which
we deﬁne as the time when hρi sinks below a given small value, drops follow-

10

ing a power law (inset of Figure 4): τ ∼ p−0.76, so that the absorbing state
is reached much faster as the network becomes disordered.

To understand the role of the AB state in the ordering dynamics in a
small world network, the results of Fig. 4 should be compared with the ones
in Fig. 5 for the two state voter model in the same small world network
[40].
In contrast with the model with two non-excluding options (Section
2), moderate values of p stop the coarsening process leading to dynamical
metastable states characterized by a plateau regime for the average interface
density [21, 22]. However the lifetime of these states is not very sensitive to
the value of p, with the characteristic time of the dynamics being just slightly
smaller than the one obtained in a regular lattice (p = 0). This is a diﬀerent
eﬀect than the strong dependence on p found for these characteristic times
when AB agents are included in the dynamics. Comparing the results of
Figs. 4 and 5 for a ﬁxed intermediate value of p, we observe that including
AB agents in the dynamics on a small world network of interactions allows
the coarsening process to take place, and it also produces an earlier decay to

11

the absorbing state.

System size dependence for a ﬁxed value of the rewiring parameter p
is analyzed in Figure 6. We observe that the initial stage of coarsening
process is grossly independent of system size, but the characteristic time of
the dynamics scales with the system size N as τ ∼ ln(N). For the two state
voter model τ ∼ N [22]. Therefore the faster decay to the absorbing state
caused by the AB agents in a large system interacting through a small world
network is measured by the ratio τAB
N . This faster decay is the
inverse than the one found for the regular lattice where the same ratio of
time scales is τAB

5. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We have studied the nonequilibirum transient dynamics of approach to
the absorbing state for a modiﬁed voter model deﬁned in Sect. 2 in which

12

the interacting agents can be in either of two equivalent states (A or B) or
in a third mixed state (AB). A global consensus state (A or B) is reached
with probability one. A domain of agents in the AB state is not stable and
the density of AB-agents becomes very small after an initial fast transient.
In spite of these facts, the AB-agents produce an essential modiﬁcation of
the processes of coarsening and domain growth, changing the interfacial noise
dynamics of the voter model into a curvature driven interface dynamics char-
acteristic of two-option models based on local majorities updating rules. We
have argued that this eﬀect is generic for small structural modiﬁcations of the
random imitation dynamics of the voter model. We have also considered the
eﬀect of the topology of the network of interactions studying our dynamical
model in a small world network. While for the original voter model the small
world topology results in long lived metastable states in which coarsening has
become to a halt [21, 22], the AB-agents restore the processes of coarsening
and domain growth. Additionally, they speed-up the decay to the absorbing
state by a ﬁnite size ﬂuctuation. We obtain a characteristic time that scales
with system size as τ ∼ ln N to be compared with the result τ ∼ N for the
voter model.

From the point of view of recent studies of linguistic dynamics the mod-
iﬁed voter model allowing for two non-exluding options, is an extension of
the microscopic version [16] of the Abrams-Strogatz model [7] for two socially
equivalent languages, to include the eﬀects of bilingualism (AB-agents) [13]
and social structure. Within the assumptions and limitations of our model,
our results imply that bilingualism and small world social structure are not
eﬃcient mechanisms to stabilize language diversity. On the contrary they are
found to ease the approach to absorbing monolingual states by an obvious
eﬀect of smoothing the communication across linguistic borders.

[36] The prefactor 1/2 comes from the original model [13], when taking into
account non-equivalent options A and B. Here it can be interpreted as
an inertia that limits the maximum probability for changing sate to 1/2
setting a microscopic time scale.

[38] It is possible to extend the perturbation of the voter model deﬁned by
eq. (3) letting ǫ to take any positive value, and choosing a modiﬁed
transition probabilitiy deﬁned as follows: pA→B as given by eq. (3) for
values of ǫ such that 0 ≤ pA→B ≤ 1; pA→B = 0(1) for values of ǫ such
that eq. (3) gives pA→B < 0(> 1). The limit ǫ → ∞, corresponds to the
step-function transition probability of the SFKI model at T=0.

[39] In these simulations we have taken a 2-dimensional lattice with eight
neighbours per node so that more possible values are allowed for the
perturbation term in eq. (3).

[40] Note that the small world network considered in [21] is obtained by a

rewiring process of a d = 1 regular lattice.

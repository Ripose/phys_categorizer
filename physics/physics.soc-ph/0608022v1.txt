Abstract

We analyze the European transition economies and show that time series for most of major indices

exhibit (i) power-law correlations in their values, power-law correlations in their magnitudes, and

(iii) asymmetric probability distribution. We propose a stochastic model that can generate time

series with all the previous features found in the empirical data.

An interesting question in economics is whether markets in transition economies defer in

their behavior from developed capital markets. One way to analyze possible diﬀerences in

behavior is to test the weak form of market eﬃciency that states that the present price of a

stock comprises all of the information about past price values implying that stock prices at

any future time cannot be predicted. In contrast to predominant behavior of ﬁnancial time

series of developed markets characterized by no or very short serial correlations [1, 2, 3, 4],

it is believed that ﬁnancial series of emerging markets exhibit diﬀerent behavior [5].

For ten transition economies in east and central Europe with statistics reported in Table

1, we analyze time series of index returns Rt = log S(t + ∆t) − log S(t), daily recorded.

Table 1 shows that none of the index time series Rt exhibits a vanishing skewness deﬁned
as a measure of asymmetry — h(x − µ)3i/σ3 — where µ and σ are the expectation and

the standard deviation, respectively. Five of time series show positive skewness, i.e., their

probability distributions have more pronounced right tail, while the rest ﬁve time series

exhibit negative skewness. Fig. 1 shows the probability distribution P (Rt) of the BUX index

with negative skewness and the Gaussian distribution clearly with vanishing skewness.

Next we calculate the kurtosis deﬁned as h(x − µ)4i/σ4 that is e.g.

for a Gaussian

distribution equal to 3. Generally, for a probability distribution with more (less) weight in

the tails, the kurtosis is greater (smaller) than 3. Table 1 shows that for none of the ten

index time series the observed probability distribution is a Gaussian.

To analyze correlations in time series, we employ the detrended ﬂuctuation analysis (DFA)

[6], the wavelet analysis and the Geweke and Porter-Hudak (GPH) method [7]. The de-

trended ﬂuctuation function F (n) follows a scaling law F (n) ∝ nα if the time series is

power-law auto-correlated. A DFA scaling exponent α > 0.5 corresponds to time series with

power-law correlations, and α = 0.5 corresponds to time series with no auto-correlations.

For GPH method, the process is said to exhibit long memory if the GPH parameter d is

from the range (0, 0.5).

For each of ten indices time series Rt, Table 1 shows the DFA scaling exponent α, Hurst

exponent H calculated by wavelet analysis, and the GPH parameter d. We show that DFA

and wavelet analysis give similar results. Besides SAX and perhaps WIG20 index, the other

indices exhibit power-law serial correlations. Similar results are obtained by GPH method

where the relation α = 0.5 + d is expected in presence of power-law correlations.

Next, we calculate the DFA scaling exponents α|R| for the time series of |Rt|. From

FIG. 1: Probability distribution of Rt calculated for the BUX index and the Gaussian distribution

with the same standard deviation as found for the BUX index. The kurtosis of P (Rt) for the BUX

index is 17, which is much greater than the kurtosis of the Gaussian probability distribution, which

is 3. We see that P (Rt) for the BUX index is negatively skewed, in opposite to the Gaussian that

is symmetric. Shown is P (Rt) of the process with ρ1 = 0.09, ρ2 = 0.3, and λ = −0.2

Table 2 we see that for each index, the time series |Rt| shows power-law auto-correlations,

a common behavior on stock markets, where generally α|R| > αR.

In order to investigate to which degree the ten time series exhibit linear and nonlinear

properties [8, 9], we phase randomize the original time series where the procedure changes

(does not change) magnitude auto-correlations for a nonlinear (linear) process [10]. During

phase-randomization procedure one performs a Fourier transform of the original time series

and then randomizes the Fourier phases keeping the Fourier amplitudes unchanged. At the
end, one calculates an inverse Fourier transform and obtains the surrogate time series ˜Rt.

For the BUX index, Fig. 2 shows the DFA functions F (n) of the time series Rt and |Rt|
together with F (n) of the phase-randomized surrogate time series ˜Rt and | ˜Rt|. As expected,
the F (n) curves of Rt and ˜Rt are the same [8]. In contrast, the time series | ˜Rt| is uncorrelated

(α| ˜R| = 0.5), while the time series |Rt| is power-law auto-correlated (α|R| = 0.8). Similar
behavior in scaling of time series we ﬁnd for all other 10 indices (see Table 1).

Next we propose a stochastic process to model time series Rt with power-law correlations

time series; |Rt| and | ˜Rt|. After phase randomization procedure, the time series | ˜Rt| has no auto-

correlations. By solid lines we show Rt and |Rt| of the process with λ = −0.2, ρ1 = 0.09, and

In Ref. [10] for the case λ = 0, ρ1 = ρ2 = ρ (ρ1,2 > 0.5), we derived the following two

scaling relations αR = 0.5 + ρ and α|R| = 0.5 + ρ between two DFA exponents αR and α|R|

and ρ. To model empirical time series with diﬀerent exponents αR and |αR|, we allow ρ1

and ρ2 to be diﬀerent.

TABLE I: Basic statistics of ﬁnancial data. Besides skewness and kurtosis, which are the measures

for asymmetry and ”fatness” in the tails, also shown is DFA exponents for time series of indices

and their magnitudes together with the corresponding values obtained after phase randomization.

Applied the process to model empirical data, ﬁrst we calculate DFA exponents αR and

α|R| and if αR < α|R|, we calculate ρ1 and ρ2 from scaling relations αR = 0.5 + ρ1 and

α|R| = 0.5 + ρ2, respectively. For the Hungarian BUX index, from the DFA exponents

αR = 0.59 and α|R| = 0.8 (see Table 1) and previous scaling relations, we calculate the

parameters ρ1 = 0.09 and ρ2 = 0.3. In Fig. 2 we show the scaling function F (n) ∝ nα for

both model time series Rt and |Rt| (solid lines), where we arbitrarily set λ = −0.2 to account

for small skewness in the empirical distribution. After performing phase-randomization
procedure, auto-correlations in | ˜Rt| vanish, while auto-correlations in ˜Rt practically remain

the same as in the original time series Rt, that is the same behavior as we found in empirical

data. In Fig.1 we also ﬁnd that P (Rt) calculated for the process ﬁts P (Rt) calculated for

the BUX index.

In conclusion, we show that for ten transition economies their market indices analyzed

exhibit (i) power-law correlations in index returns, (ii) power-law correlations in the mag-

nitudes, where the probability distributions exhibit (iii) asymmetric behavior. These three

properties we model with a stochastic process speciﬁed by only three parameters.

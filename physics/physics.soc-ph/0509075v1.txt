Abstract

What processes can explain how very large populations are able to converge on the

use of a particular word or grammatical construction without global coordination?

Answering this question helps to understand why new language constructs usually

propagate along an S-shaped curve with a rather sudden transition towards global

agreement. It also helps to analyze and design new technologies that support or or-

chestrate self-organizing communication systems, such as recent social tagging sys-

tems for the web. The article introduces and studies a microscopic model of commu-

nicating autonomous agents performing language games without any central control.

We show that the system undergoes a disorder/order transition, going trough a sharp

1

Baronchelli et al.

symmetry breaking process to reach a shared set of conventions. Before the transition,

the system builds up non-trivial scale-invariant correlations, for instance in the distri-

bution of competing synonyms, which display a Zipf-like law. These correlations make

the system ready for the transition towards shared conventions, which, observed on

the time-scale of collective behaviors, becomes sharper and sharper with system size.

This surprising result not only explains why human language can scale up to very

large populations but also suggests ways to optimize artiﬁcial semiotic dynamics.

1 Introduction

Bluetooth, blogosphere, ginormous, greenwash, folksonomy. Lexicographers have to add thou-

sands of new words to dictionaries every year and revise the usage of many more. Although

precise data is hard to come by, lexicographers agree that there is a period in which novelty

spreads and different words compete, followed by a rather dramatic transition after which al-

most everyone uses the same word or construction [1]. This ‘semiotic dynamics’ has lately

become of technological interest because of the sudden popularity of new web-tools (such as

del.icio.us or www.ﬂickr.com) which enable human web-users to self-organize a system of tags

and that way build up and maintain social networks and share information. Tracking the emer-

gence of new tags shows similar phenomena of slow spreading followed by sudden transitions

in which one tag overtakes all others. There is currently also a growing number of experiments

where artiﬁcial software agents or robots bootstrap a shared lexicon without human interven-

tion [2, 3]. These applications may revolutionize search in peer-to-peer information systems [4]

by orchestrating emergent semantics [5] as opposed to relying on designer-deﬁned ontologies

such as in the semantic web [6]. They will be needed when we send groups of robots to deal

autonomously with unforeseeable tasks in largely unknown environments, such as in the explo-

ration of distant planets or deep seas, hostile environments, etc. By deﬁnition it will not be pos-

sible to deﬁne all the needed communication conventions and ontologies in advance and robots

will have to build up and negotiate their own communication systems, situated and grounded in

their ongoing activities [7]. Designers of emergent communication systems want to know what

kind of mechanisms need to be implemented so that the artiﬁcial agents effectively converge

towards a shared communication system and they want to know the scaling laws to see how far

the technology will carry.

2 The Naming Game

Some of the earlier work on studying the emergence of communication conventions has adopted

an evolutionary approach [8, 9]. Vocabularies are assumed to be genetically inherited. The de-

gree in which an agent’s vocabulary is similar to that of others is considered to determine his

ﬁtness and so natural selection drives successive generations towards convergence due to gene

spreading. A variant of this model assumes learning by children from their parent(s) instead of

genetic transmission [10, 11], yielding a very similar dynamics. Here we are interested however

in phenomena that happen on a much more rapid time-scale, during the life-span of agents and

without the need for successive generations. All agents will be considered peers that have the

right to invent and negotiate language use. We introduce and study a microscopic model of

communicating agents, inspired by the so-called Naming Game [12], in which agents have only

local peer-to-peer interactions without central control nor ﬁtness-based selection, but neverthe-

less manage to reach a global consensus. There can be a ﬂux in the population, but generation

change is not necessary for reaching coherence. Peer-to-peer emergent linguistic coherence has

also been studied in [13] focusing on how a population selects among a set of possible grammars

already known to each agent, whereas here we investigate how conventions may develop from

scratch as a side effect of situated and grounded communications. The Naming Game model to

be studied here uses as little processing power as possible and thus establishes a lower-bound

on cognitive complexity and performance.

In contrast with other models of language self-

organization, agents do not maintain information about the success rate of individual words and

do not use any intelligent heuristics like choice of best word so far or cross-situational learning.

We want to understand how the microscopic dynamics of the agent interactions can nevertheless

3

Preprint

Baronchelli et al.

give rise to global coherence without external intervention.

The Naming Game is played by a population of N agents trying to bootstrap a common

vocabulary for a certain number M of individual objects present in their environment, so that

one agent can draw the attention of another one to an object, e.g. to obtain it or converse further

about it. The objects can be people, physical objects, relations, web sites, pictures, music ﬁles,

or any other kind of entity for which a population aims at reaching a consensus as far their

naming is concerned. Each player is characterized by his inventory, i.e. the word-object pairs

he knows. All the agents have empty inventories at time t = 0. At each time step (t = 1, 2, ..)

two players are picked at random and one of them plays as speaker and the other as hearer.

Their interaction obeys the following rules (see Fig. 1):

The speaker selects an object from the current context;

The speaker retrieves a word from its inventory associated with the chosen object, or, if

its inventory is empty, invents a new word;

The speaker transmits the selected word to the hearer;

If the hearer has the word named by the speaker in its inventory and that word is associated

to the object chosen by the speaker, the interaction is a success and both players maintain

in their inventories only the winning word, deleting all the others;

If the hearer does not have the word named by the speaker in its inventory, the interaction

is a failure and the hearer updates its inventory by adding an association between the new

word and the object.

•

•

•

•

•

This model makes a number of assumptions. Each player can in principle play with all the other

players, i.e. there is no speciﬁc underlying topology for the structure of the interaction network.

So the game can be viewed as an inﬁnite dimension (or “mean ﬁeld”) Naming Game (an almost

realistic situation thanks to the modern communication networks). Second, we assume that the

number of possible words is so huge that the probability that two players invent the same word at

4

Preprint

Baronchelli et al.

two different times for two different objects is practically negligible (this means that homonymy

is not taken into account here) and so the choice dynamics among the possible words associated

with a speciﬁc object are completely independent. As a consequence, we can reduce, without

loss of generality, the environment as consisting of only one single object (M = 1). Third,

we assume that speaker and hearer are able to establish whether the game was successful by

subsequent action. For example, the speaker may refer to an object in the environment he wants

to obtain and the hearer then hands the right object. If the game is a failure, the speaker may

point or get the object himself so that it is clear to the hearer which object was intended.

3 Phenomenology

The ﬁrst property of interest is the time evolution of the total number of words owned by the

population Nw(t), of the number of different words Nd(t), and of the success rate S(t). In

Figure (2) we report these curves averaged over 3000 runs for a population of N = 1000

agents, along with two examples of single run curves. It is evident that single runs originate

quite irregular curves. We assume in these simulations that only two agents interact at each

time step, but the model is perfectly applicable to the case where any number of agents interact

simultaneously.

Clearly, the system undergoes spontaneously a disorder/order transition to an asymptotic

state where global coherence emerges, i.e. every agent has the same word for the same object.

It is remarkable that this happens starting from completely empty inventories for each agent.

The asymptotic state is one where a word invented during the time evolution took over with

respect to the other competing words and imposed itself as the leading word. In this sense

the system spontaneously selects one of the many possible coherent asymptotic states and the

transition can thus be seen as a symmetry breaking transition.

The key question now is whether one can prove that this transition will always take place

and on what time-scale. We also want to know whether the system will scale with respect to

population size. To address the ﬁrst question, we deﬁne the overlap state function as O =

5

the number of words in common between ai and aj. The overlap function monitors the level

. On the other hand, looking at the single realization, this function grows

> O(t) except for a set a very rare conﬁgurations whose statistical

weight is negligible. So this monotonicity combined with the fact that the overlap function is

bounded, i.e. O(t)

1, strongly supports that the system will indeed reach a ﬁnal coherent

≤

state. This is consistent with the fact that the coherent state is the only state stable under the

dynamical rules of the model. The more challenging question then concerns under what scaling

conditions convergence is reached.

We can distinguish three phases in the behavior of the system, compatible with the S-shaped

curve typically observed in the spreading of new language conventions in human populations [1,

14, 15]. Very early, pairs of agents play almost uncorrelated games and the number of words

hence increases over time as Nw(t) = 2t, while the number of different words increases as

Nd(t) = t. In this phase one can look at the system as a random graph where pairs of agents

are connected if they have a word in common. Because two players always have the same word

after a failed game, each failure at this stage corresponds to adding an edge to the graph. This

Then the system enters a second stage in which it starts building correlations (i.e. multiple

links connecting agents who have more than one word in common) and collective behavior

emerges. We see in the simulations (see inset of ﬁg.1c) that the rate of success S(t) in this stage

increases as S(t)

3t/N 2 and we have been able to show analytically why this is the case 1.

In this article, we focus on the third stage, when the disorder/order transition takes place. It

occurs close to the time when Nw(t) reaches its maximum. Although one might assume intu-

itively that the transition towards global coherence is gradual, we see in fact a sudden transition

towards a consensus, and, even more remarkably, the transition gets steeper and steeper as the

population size increases. This is important because it shows that the system scales up to large

populations.

Time-scales In order to better see this phenomenon and then understand why it is the case,

we ﬁrst look more carefully at the time scales involved in the process, speciﬁcally how the

observables of the system scale with the size N of the population. Figure (3a) shows the scaling

of the peak and convergence times of the total number of words with N. Both curves exhibit a

power law behavior2 with an exponent 3/2. The distributions for peak and convergence times,

for a given size N, are not Gaussian but ﬁt well with the Weibull extreme value distribution [18]

(data shown in the supplementary material).

The scaling of the maximum number of words Nw(tmax) is clearly governed by a power law

distribution Nw(tmax)

N 3/2 as well, as shown in Figure (3b). Here is how the exponent can

∼

be analytically derived. Assume that, at the maximum, the average number of words per agent

scales as N α, with α unknown. Then one should impose:

dNw(t)

1
cN α (1

2cN α

)

2cN α,

where

dt ∝

−
cN α is the probability for the speaker to play a speciﬁc word and cN α

N/2 is the probability
that the hearer possesses the word played by the speaker. So the two terms are the gain term (in

case of a failed game) and a loss term (in case of a successful game) respectively.

Imposing dNw(t)

dt = 0 one gets α = 1/2. Exploiting the relation S(t)

3t/N 2 pointed out

≃

earlier and valid also at the moment the peak is reached, one can predict the scaling of the time
of the peak as tmax ∼

N

2 .

3

Based on these observations, we have one time scale of the order N where the system

performs uncorrelated language games. Next, there is the much more interesting time scale

deviations exhibit a log-periodic behavior and deserve further investigations.

2 , which is the time-scale for collective behaviors in the system, i.e. the time scale over which

the multi-agent system collectively builds correlations and performs the spontaneous symmetry

breaking transition. Figure (3c) reports success rate curves, S(t), for different population sizes,

all rescaled according to a transformation equivalent to t

t/N 3/2 (see Figure caption for

details on the rescaling). It is immediately clear that the behavior of these curves, when observed

on the collective time-scale N 3/2, changes with system size N.

In particular the transition

between a regime of scarce or absent communication, S(t)

0, and a situation of efﬁcient

communication, S(t)

1, i.e. the disorder/order transition, tends to become steeper and steeper

≃

when the population size increases. In order to explain this phenomenon we need to look at what

→

≃

happens slightly before the transition.

4 Network Analysis

We ﬁrst investigate the behavior of agent inventories and single words at the microscopic level.

Since each agent is characterized by its inventory, a ﬁrst interesting aspect to investigate is

the time evolution of the fraction of players having an inventory of a given size. A nontrivial

phenomena (data shown in the supplementary material) emerges in the fraction of players with

only one word. At the beginning, this fraction grows since each player has only one word

after his ﬁrst interaction, then it decreases, because the ﬁrst interactions are usually failures and

agents store the new word they encounter, and eventually it grows again until the moment of

convergence when all the players have the same unique word. So, the histogram of the number

of agents versus their inventory sizes k is a precious description of the system at a given time.

In particular, slightly before the convergence, the normalized distribution p(k) deviates from a

relatively ﬂat structure to exhibit a power-law:

with the cut-off function f (x) = 1 for x << √N and f (x) = 0 for x >> √N . Numerically it

We now turn to an analysis of the single words themselves. In Figure (4) the different words

are ordered according to their popularity so that the ranking of the most common single word is

1. During the ﬁrst two stages, the distribution of the words can be described with a power law.

However, approaching the transition, the ﬁrst ranked single word starts to become more and

more popular, while all the other words are power-law distributed with an exponent α which

changes over time (reminiscent of Zipf’s law [19] and consistent with Polya’s urn models [20]).

Concretely, the global distribution for the fraction of agents possessing the R-ranked word,

n(R), can be described as:

n(R) = n(1)δR,1 +

the number of players with the most popular word, is a ﬁnite fraction of the whole population

(a feature reminiscent of the Bose-Einstein condensation [21]).

To explain why the disorder/order transition becomes steeper and steeper in the thermody-

namic limit, we must investigate the dynamics that leads to the state where all agents have the

same unique word. In other words, we need to understand how the network of agents, where

each word is represented by a fully connected clique 4, reaches its ﬁnal state of fully connected

graph with only single links. A successful interaction determines the removal of a node from

all the cliques corresponding to the deleted words of the two agents while a failure causes the

increment of an element of the clique corresponding to the uttered word. Combining this view

of the population as a network with the fact that the spreading of the most popular word exceeds

that of less common ones, we see that evolution towards convergence proceeds in a multiplica-

tive fashion, pushing further the popularity of the most common word while decreasing that of

the others. An interaction in which the most common word is played will more likely lead to

success, and hence the clique corresponding to the most common word will tend to increase,

while other cliques will lose nodes. To put this argument on a formal footing, we have to de-

termine how the number of deleted links, Md, in a successful interaction, scales with N, so that

we can estimate the rate at which the smaller cliques disappear from the network. It holds:

5 Discussion and conclusions

In this article we have introduced and studied the semiotic dynamics of a model of commu-

nication which does not rely on generational transmission (genetic or cultural) for reaching

linguistic coherence but on self-organization. The model deﬁnes the microscopic behavior of

the agents and is therefore directly implementable and thus applicable for building emergent

communication systems in artiﬁcial multi-agent systems. We showed that the model exhibits

the same phenomena as observed in human semiotic dynamics, namely a period of preparation

followed by a rather sharp disorder/order transition. We have identiﬁed the different time-scales

involved in the process, both for individual and collective behaviors. We have explained this

dynamics by observing a build up of non trivial dynamical correlations in the agents’ invento-

10

ries, which display a Zipf-like distribution for competing synonyms, until the moment where a

speciﬁc word breaks the symmetry and imposes itself very rapidly in the whole system.

The Naming Game model studied here is as simple as possible. One can imagine more

intelligent and hence more realistic strategies and the invention and learning may involve much

more complex forms of language, but that would make the present theoretical analysis less clear.

By focusing on few and simple rules, we have been able to identify the main ingredients to

describe how the population develops a shared and efﬁcient communication system. The good

news, from the viewpoint of applications, like emergent communication systems in populations

of software agents, is that a well-chosen microscopic behavior allows a scale-up to very large

populations. This is particularly important for experiments about emergent communication

systems of software agents.

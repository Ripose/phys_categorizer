Abstract

A mean ﬁeld statistical mechanics model of two interacting groups of spins is intro-

duced and the phase transition studied in terms of their relative size. A jump of the

average magnetization is found for large values of the mutual interaction when the

relative percentage of the two populations crosses a critical threshold. It is shown

how the critical percentage depends on internal interactions and on the initial mag-

netizations. The model is interpreted as a prototype of resident-immigrant cultural

interaction and conclusions from the social sciences perspectives are drawn.

1 Introduction

In the last few decades the statistical mechanics approach has seen an impressive expan-

sion in ﬁelds as diverse as combinatorial optimization, ﬁnance, biology and others. Its

success relies upon the fact that every problem of many interacting parts may be stud-

ied by its methods and techniques. Our plan in this work is to introduce a statistical

mechanics model with the purpose of describing two homogeneous groups of individuals

whose interaction is imitative within the same group but may be imitative or counter-

imitative between diﬀerent groups. Such a model may represent a ﬁrst attempt toward

the construction of a statistical mechanics theory of the phenomenon of cultural inter-

change. When two populations come in contact, like in the case of immigration but also

1

in a more general context through the media, it is often seen how cultural traits are some-

times mixed, while some other times one of the two dominates and prevails on the other.

Examples are found in linguistics, as well as in opinion forming dynamics ([1],[2],[3]). One

interesting feature of those changes is that sometimes they appear to be smoothly varying

with the relative proportions of the two groups, some other times the crossing of a critical

value triggers a jump of the observed quantity [4]. We want to stress that what we are

building here is the mean ﬁeld theory of the two population problem i.e. we consider every

individual interacting with every other with the same strength. In future works we plan

to introduce a more realistic model by allowing randomness of the interaction strength

like in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass model ([5] [6]) and also a more structured

network connection like, for instance, the one predicted by the small-world theory [7] [8].

The dictionary we plan to follow is easily explained by saying that a cultural trait is

considered for simplicity as a dichotomic variable σi = ±1. The interaction between par-

ticles is built up as a sum of pairwise interactions and plays the role of cultural interaction

between two individuals i and j as described by a potential, or a cost function, which sim-

ply reﬂects the will to “agree” or “disagree” among the two. The two attitudes of imitation

or counter-imitation lie on a well established socio-psychological background [9, 10, 11]; on

the other hand they have also a robust mathematical-physical ground since they have been

used to study many particles theory of ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic interactions.

The problem we have addressed with the help of an equilibrium statistical mechanics

model is to establish whether -in the case of two populations placed in contact- there

may be a phase transition in the average cultural trait from one of the two original

cultural traits to the other. If so, for which value of the relative percentage of the two

populations it happens. Moreover, we want to establish how the critical size depends

on the original parameters in order to predict or potentially avoid unwanted dramatic

phenomena sometimes occurring in society.

The parameters describing our system are m∗

1 and m∗

2 i.e. the magnetizations of the

two populations prior to their interaction which represent the two culture legacies, the

couplings J1,1, J2,2 which measure the strength of the imitation within each group and J1,2

2

which measure the strength of the imitation or counter-imitation among the two groups.

The phase transition is tuned by the parameter α = N1/N which counts the percentage

of immigrants, 1 − α = N2/N being the fraction of residents.

Our results, explained in detail in section 3, show that when the mutual interaction

between the two groups J1,2 is small enough the transition from the resident to the immi-

grant culture is smooth. But for large values of the interaction there is a critical value of

the immigrant percentage αc crossing which the system undergoes a sudden change from

the resident to the foreign culture.

We ﬁnd moreover that high values of the culture legacy favour both the emergence of

the immigrant culture (αc decreases with m∗
increases with m∗

2) as intuition would suggest. On the contrary, a high internal imitation

1) and the persistence of the local culture (αc

(high coesion and low diversiﬁcation) makes each culture weaker toward the other (αc

increases with J1,1 and decreases with J2,2). This last result is rather counter-intuitive but

not surprising since in social sciences it is often seen how a diversiﬁed culture dominates

an opinionated one. From a technical point of view the dependence of αc on J1,1 and J2,2

is explained by the detailed balance between energy and entropy, the second being the

leading term in those situations in which a phase transition occurs.

The model we introduce is deﬁned by the Hamiltonian

see [12] for some results on the model.

The symbol σi represents the opinion of the ith individual of the total population,

which can either take value σi = +1 or σi = −1. We consider only the case of symmetric

matrices Ji,j. The general case can be easily reduced to the symmetric one by standard

methods.

We divide the total population I into a partition of 2 subsets I1 ∪ I2 = I, of N1 = |I1|

3

and N2 = |I2| with N1 + N2 = N. Given two individuals σi and σj , their mutual

interaction parameter Jij depends on their respective subsets, as speciﬁed by the matrix

The interacting system is therefore described by three degrees of freedom: J11 and

J22 tune the interactions within each of the two subsets, and J12 controls the interaction

between two individuals belonging to diﬀerent sets. We assume J11 > 0 and J22 > 0,

whereas J12 can be either positive or negative.

Analogously, the ﬁeld hi takes two values h1 and h2, depending on the subset containing

σi, as described by the following vector:

α =

By introducing the magnetization of a subset I as

and indicating by m1 and m2 the magnetizations within the subsets I1 and I2 and by

the fraction of the ﬁrst group on the whole, we may easily express the Hamiltonian

1+2J12α(1−α)m1m2+J22(1−α)2m2

− h1αm1 − h2(1 − α)m2

(cid:3)

In order to study the thermodynamical properties of the model it is interesting to

observe that the Hamiltonian is left invariant by the action of a group of transformations.
The group is described by G = Z2 × Z2 × Z2.

We can represent a point in our parameter space as (m, J, h, ˆα), where

m = 

Therefore, given the limitations on the values of our parameters, the whole parameter

space is given by S = [−1, 1]2 × R2 × R+ × R2 × [0, 1].

If we consider the representation of G given by the 8 matrices

we can consider the action of G on S as given by

φ : G × S → S

where

φ[M, (m, J, h, ˆα)] = (Mm, MJM−1

, Mh, MˆαM−1

)

for every x ∈ S and M ∈ G and it’s straightforward to check that

H(x) = H(φ(M, x)).

This can be easily done by writing the Hamiltonian per particle in vector notation as

H(m, J, h, ˆα)

In order to obtain the analytic solution of the proposed model we consider the Boltzmann-

Gibbs measure of weight

The ﬁrst two lines represent the internal energy contribution and the second the entropy

in a state of magnetization µ = (µ1, µ2).

Once we have the pressure it’s easy to show that hmi, in the thermodynamical limit,

can be written as

hmi = αhm1i + (1 − α)hm2i

(2.4)

where hm1i and hm2i (the average magnetizations within the subsets I1 and I2) are found

to be the maximizers of f (µ1, µ2) in (2.2).

The stationarity condition for the function f (µ1, µ2) in (2.2) gives

µ1 = tanh(J11αµ1 + J12(1 − α)µ2 + h1)

µ2 = tanh(J12αµ1 + J22(1 − α)µ2 + h2)

This system has generically nine solutions, four of which are stable solutions corre-

sponding to relative maxima. These can be found numerically by interpreting the (2.5)

as a ﬁxed point equation of a two dimensional map. See [15] and [14] for the study of a

similar case in which only a subcase of the (2.5) is studied. See also [16] for the use of

the mean ﬁeld ferromagnetic equations for a single population.

In our model the values of h1 and h2 shall not be considered as independent parameters

but as functions of the average magnetizations and internal interactions in each original

population when there is no mutual interaction between the two.

Denoting by m∗

1 and m∗

2 the magnetization values at equilibrium within the population

1 and 2 respectively, one has:

So our main quantity hmi is a function of ﬁve parameters:

3 Numerical results

in terms of the free parameters.

We have analyzed the numerical solutions of the system (2.5) and studied the behaviour

The main quantity we study is hmi. In the sociological context it may represent the

average opinion of the interacting system consisting of the population of immigrants and

residents.

In particular, two main questions are addressed. First, what are the conditions that

may lead to an instability of hmi in terms of the fraction of immigrants α? Second, how

does the critical behaviour depends on the free parameters?

As discussed in the previous section we may restrict our study to the case of J1,2 ≥ 0.

The behaviour in the other regime can be deduced by symmetry.

The results can be summarised in the following way.

Figure 1 shows the total average magnetization hmi as a function of α and the mutual

interaction strength J1,2.

7

Figure 1: hmi as a function of J1,2 and α

What we see is that when J1,2 is small enough the magnetization is smoothly varying in

α from m∗

2 to m∗

1 i.e. the value of the magnetization within the residents and immigrants

before the mutual interaction takes place. But when the J1,2 crosses a critical value we

observe that the magnetization exhibits a discontinuous transition. The value of α at

which the discontinuity occurs does not depend on J1,2. This means that the critical αc
depends on the four parameters J1,1, J2,2, m∗

1. Numerical results show that αc can be

2, m∗

arbitrarily small for a suitable choice of the parameters it depends on. It is interesting

then to investigate how αc depends on the interactions and on the original values of the

magnetizations.

We ﬁrst present the results concerning the dependence of hmi in terms of the original

magnetization within populations 1 and 2, i.e. the opinion of the immigrants and residents

before interaction. In order to do so we study the following interaction matrix for j ∈ [0, 7]

where J11 = J22 = 1 and J12 = j > 0. We work with α ∈ [0, 1], and study hmi w.r.t.

The dependence of αc in terms of the cultural legacies m∗ appears to be rather intu-

itive: the more the immigrant population is polarised (large negative values of m∗

1), the

less is the amount of immigrants necessary to induce a phase transition. Equivalently, the
more the resident population is polarised (large positive value of m∗

2 ) the larger is αc.

Pictures (a)-(f) in Figure 2 show some cases of surface Mm∗(j, α) for m∗

2 = 0.3 and

1. The values of αc increase from 0 to 1 when m∗

1 varies from -0.05 to -0.95

1 and m∗

(picture (f), bottom).

Socially speaking, the transition has to be read as follows: for large enough intercul-

tural interactions j, when α < αc the resident culture prevails, while when α > αc the

immigrant culture prevails. An abrupt switch occurs when α = αc. Consequently, the

critical value shows what fraction of immigrants is necessary to make the resident opinion

lose its leadership over the entire population.

The value of αc varies with m∗. We may build a surface Sαc (Figure 3) where αc is a

function of the non-interacting conﬁguration m∗ with m∗

1 ∈ [−1, 0] and m∗

a change, given the initial cultures of the two non-interacting populations. Its behaviour

agrees with intuition: the stronger the immigrant original culture, the smaller the percent-

age of them necessary to lead the opinion i.e. the critical percentage decreases with the

immigrant culture strength. Viceversa the percentage increases with a stronger resident

culture.

We shall now investigate the dependence of αc on J1,1 and J2,2. To do this we start

from Figure 1 and increase J1,1 from 0.9 to 1.05, leaving the other parameters unchanged.

The result of this variation is Figure 4(b): comparing it with the original picture,

shown on the side, we see how the discontinuity in the surface has been drawn forward to

a bigger value of αc: the critical percentage turns out to be increasing with the strength

of the immigrant interaction J1,1. The more the immigrants tend to imitate each other,

the less eﬀective their inﬂuence is in the interacting system. This result may seem at odds

with intuition, and suggests that a more diversiﬁed population is more likely to impose

its cultural traits.

This turns out to be a general feature of our simulations. Consider Figure 4(c): we

have set J1,2 = 2 and we have let J11 vary between 0 and 1.2. As a result, we see how αc

increases monotonically with J11.

Similarly, by symmetry considerations, it is straightforward that an increase in the

interaction strength within population 2 (J22) will lead to a decrease in αc.

As a consequence, our study of the model reveals that an increase in the interaction

strength within a population doesn’t reinforce the population’s own position within the

total magnetization but, on the contrary, hastens the discontinuous transition towards

the competing population’s culture. The dependence of αc on J11 and J22 is summarised

by Figure 5.

4 Comments

In this paper we have analyzed a two population mean ﬁeld statistical mechanics spin

model. The study of its phase structure in terms of the relative proportions of the two

populations has been carried on. We have seen that the average magnetization of the two

interacting populations may vary smoothly when the interchange coeﬃcient is small, but

also abruptly when the coeﬃcient is large. The critical value of the relative proportion

has been studied in terms of both the initial values of the magnetizations within each

population and a standard behaviour has been found. More intriguing is the observed

dependence of the critical percentage in terms of the internal cohesion of each group.

Due to a ﬁne balance between internal energy and entropy we ﬁnd that a strong cohesion

penalizes the group.

The model proposed is the simplest statistical mechanics model for the phenomenon

of cultural contact, especially in the case of the residents and immigrants interaction. The

dictionary associates a dichotomic opinion (like being in favour or against death penalty)

to the two values of the spins. The interaction between two individuals is mapped into a

ferromagnetic term in the Hamiltonian. The mean values within residents and immigrants

of the country opinions are considered as cultural legacies and are compared to the average

of the interacting mixed populations. The main result of this work from the social science

perspective is to show that statistical mechanics predicts the possibility to have cultural

dramatic changes during social contact. Moreover, it shows that the resident culture

is more stable in its ability to survive the immigrant inﬂuence when imitation between

residents is low and diversiﬁcation is high. Equivalently, the power of the immigrant

culture to take over and spread into the new country is lowered by a high internal imitation

and low diversiﬁcation.

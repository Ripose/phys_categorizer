Diﬀerent distance matrices are deﬁned and applied to look for corre-
lations between the gross domestic product of G7 countries. Results are
illustrated through displays obtained from various graph methods. Signif-
icant similarities between results are obtained. A procedure for choosing
the best distance function is proposed taking into account the size of the
window in which correlation are averaged.

1. Introduction

Various conclusions on correlations depend on the window size in which
the averaging technique is performed, e.g. one can obtain correlation lengths,
Hurst exponents, detrended ﬂuctuation analysis exponents, [1, 2, 3, 4] etc.
There are two main competitive factors: requirements on statistical preci-
sion and information loss. If the time window size is large the ”quality” of
calculated statistical parameters is high (due to the central limit theorem in
probability theory [5]) while the information is lost and the results are less
sensitive to local features if the window is small. In the case of economy
and ﬁnancial time series it is known that the time series are nonstationary,
so not only the value of considered parameters evolves in time but also their
stochastic properties. Therefore the problem of the time window size is one
of the very important factors in such analyses.

calculation every step of the procedure introduces an error. Numerical er-
rors accumulate and in some cases (especially in nonlinear analysis) can
quickly inﬂuence the results. Therefore this factor should be taken under
consideration when deciding upon the size of the time window. Therefore
the procedure of adjusting the size of the time window is an optimisation
problem with two opposite competing factors. In order to ﬁnd correlations
the time window must be moved along the signal, in so doing the subsequent
analysis is a ”moving average” size window optimisation.

The analysis of the time window optimisation is herebelow done on the
basis of correlation analyses between G7 countries (France, USA, United
Kingdom, Germany1, Japan, Italy, Canada). The macroeconomy situation
is described by theirs Gross Domestic Product (GDP), since in most coun-
tries GDP is considered as an oﬃcial parameter of the economic situation.
GDP is usually deﬁned as a sum of all ﬁnal goods and services produced in
the country, i.e. equal to the total consumer, investment and government
spending, plus the value of exports, minus the value of imports2. Addi-
tionally in order to deﬁne a reference country an artiﬁcial ”All” country is
constructed. GDP of ”All” country is deﬁned as a sum of GDP of all 7
countries. So the GDP increment of ”All” can be considered as an averaged
level of development.

The GDP values for each of these countries are ﬁrst normalised to their
1990 value given in US dollars as published by the Groningen Growth and
Development Centre on their web page3. The data cover the period between
1950 and 2003, i.e. 54 points for each country.

2. Distance deﬁnition

The equal time t correlation function between A and B is deﬁned as

corr(t,T )(A, B) =

<AB>(t,T )

(<A2>(t,T )

−<A>2

−<A>(t,T )<B>(t,T )
(t,T ))(<B2>(t,T )

−<B>2

(t,T ))

.

(1)

q

The brackets < . . . > denote a mean value over the time window T at time
t. In the following, A and B will be the GDP yearly increments of a given
country, i.e.

∆GDP (t) =

GDP (t) − GDP (t − 1)
GDP (t − 1)

.

1 Germany is considered as a one country. To have a record before consolidation the

data are constructed as a sum of GDP of both German countries.

Since the time series consists of a discrete set of numbers and the time
evolution of which is thought to be stochastic the following metrics are used
and the results compared.

1. The statistical distance d(A, B)(t,T ) is

d(A, B)(t,T ) = r

(1 − corr(t,T )(A, B)),

(3)

1
2

where t and T are the ﬁnal point and the size of the time window over
which an average is taken respectively.

2. The discrete distance dLq (A, B) is deﬁned as the sum of absolute values

between time series, i.e.

dLq (A, B) = (

n

|ai − bi|q)

1
q ,

(4)

Xi=1
where A, B are time series: A = (a1, a2, . . . , an), B = (b1, b2, . . . , bn).

3. The distribution distance dLq (A, B) the distance deﬁned between dis-
tribution functions. As a initial step a distribution function should
be chosen on the basis of statistical tests, then the considered distri-
bution functions have to be ﬁtted (or appropriate parameters calcu-
lated). Since the statistical parameters describing GDP increments
are very close to the normal distribution [6] it is hereby assumed that
the GDP increments are truly described by the normal distribution.
The distance is taken as the metrics of Lq in Hilbert space [7], i.e.

dLq (A, B) = [
Z

−∞

+∞

|pA(r) − pB(r)|qdr]

1
q ,

(5)

where pA(r) and pB(r) are the appropriate distribution function ﬁtted
to the data.

For the sake of result clarity the analysis is restricted to the case of
q = 1. The properties of distances measures with q > 1 will be discussed
elsewhere.

There are diﬀerent advantages and inconveniences to those distance
functions. Eq.(3), a statistical distance, is specially sensitive to observing
linear correlations. The discrete Hilbert space Lq distance, Eq.(4), can be
applied to any data and does not require any special properties of the data,
thereby seeming to be very useful for comparing various sets of data. The
distribution distance, Eq.(5), is the most sophisticated one since it requires
a knowledge of the data distribution function, but it allows to compare the
statistical properties of the data. The main disadvantage of this method is
its sensitivity to the size of the data set, since it compares the (assumed)
distribution functions.

3. Network deﬁnition

In order to obtain the information about the correlations between coun-
tries a graph analysis of distance matrices is performed. The described below
graphs (LMST, BMLP and UMLP) are built as a function of time and for
moving time windows of various sizes (from 5 years (yrs) up to 52 yrs). The
size of the time window is constant during the displacement. The mean
distance between countries is calculated and averaged over number of gen-
erated graphs. (The number of generated graphs is equal to the diﬀerence
of increments data points (here 53) and the size of the time window.) Fi-
nally statistical properties (mean value, standard deviation, skewness and
kurtosis) of the twice averaged distance between countries are calculated
and discussed. Within the paper the mean value of the distance between
countries is understood as a mean value averaged over the number of links
on a graph and the number of calculated graphs.

The graph analysis of the distance matrices are based on three types of

graph structures:

LMST The Locally Minimal Spanning Tree is the version of a Minimal
Spanning Tree (MST) under the assumption that the root of MST is
the pair of closest neighbours.

For the sake of simplicity the minimal length path algorithm (MLP) [6]
It is a 1-D modiﬁcation of the MST algorithm. This algorithm
is used.
emphasises the strongest correlation between entities with the constraint
that the item is attached only once to the network. This results in a lack
of loops on the ”tree”. Two diﬀerent graphs: the unidirectionally growing
and the bidirectionally growing minimal length paths (UMLP and BMLP
respectively) are constructed. The UMLP and BMLP algorithms are deﬁned
as follows:

UMLP The algorithm begins with choosing an initial point of the chain.
Here the initial point is the ”All” country. Next the shortest con-
nection between the initial point and the other possible neighbours
(in terms of the distance deﬁnition - Eq.(4), (3) or (5) is looked for.
The closest possible one is selected and the country attached to the
initial point. One searches next for the entity closest to the previously
attached one, and repeats the process.

BMLP The algorithm begins with searching for the pair of countries which
has the shortest distance between them. Then these countries become
the root of a chain. In the next step the closet country for both ends of
the chain is searched. Being selected it is attached to the appropriate
end. Next a search is made for the closest neighbour of the new ends
of the chain. Being selected, the entity is attached, a.s.o.

4. Distance and network analysis

The results are presented for every distance measure, i.e. application
of statistical distance in Fig.1, discrete distance in Fig.2 and ﬁnally the
distribution distance in Fig.1.

In the case of the statistical distance (Eq.(3)) and the discrete metrics
(Eq.(4)) (Fig.1 and Fig.2 respectively) the mean distances (understood as
it is deﬁned in the section 2) between considered countries increase with the
time window size.

The results obtained by application of the statistical distance, Eq.(3) is
are presented in the Fig.1. The averaged distances between countries are
very similar in all considered graph methods and almost parallel to each
other. In the case of other basic statistical properties the similarities are
even stronger. For other considered statistical parameters i.e.
standard
deviation, skewness and kurtosis plots are almost identical. The standard
deviation is decreasing (except for a few points). This suggests that linear

correlations between countries are better seen for longer window size and the
co-operation between those countries has a stable form best seen in the long
time scale. Of course there are problems with the size of considered data.
While increasing the time window size the amount of data is decreasing
which results in signiﬁcant changes in skewness and kurtosis value for time
window size longer than 40 yrs.

In the case of the discrete distance function (Eq.(4) the mean value of
distances between countries increases linearly with the time window size
(Fig.2). This observation is also supported by the value of the linear cor-
relation coeﬃcient (Eq.(1)) which is very close to one (table 1) for all of
investigated structures. This relationship is caused by the properties of the
applied distance function, (Eq.(4), which accumulates the diﬀerences be-
tween the considered time series. Therefore it is not suggested to use it in
order to compare properties of diﬀerent time window sizes, unless properly
normalised but it may be usefull in an analysis of the evolution of a system
within a given time window size.

As in the case of the statistical distance there are no signiﬁcant diﬀer-
ences between standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis for LMST, UMLP and
BMLP (Fig.(2)). The standard deviation has a maximum at 30 yrs time
window. It means that within this time window there is the largest spread
of distances between considered countries. These results may be the most
interesting ones for analysis, because the time evolution may reveal signif-
icant changes or a nontrivial evolution of the distances between countries.
From an information content the point of view the LMST method gives
the highest amount of information, because the standard deviation of mean
distances is the highest for this graph algorithm.

In the case of the distribution distance deﬁned by Eq.(5), the mean dis-
tances between countries are decreasing monotonically up to the 30 yrs time
window and stabilising or slowly increasing (with respect to the behaviour
for the time window size ¡ 30 yrs) for longer window size. The other sta-
tistical properties (standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis) are as in the
previously considered cases (statistical distance and discrete distance) al-
most identical for all considered graph methods. The standard deviation is
decreasing monotonically within the considered perion while skewness and
kurtosis have a maximum for the time window size equal 20 yrs.

For all considered graph methods the LMST algorithm gives the lowest
mean distance value (Figs 1, 2, 3). It is also worth noticing that despite
diﬀerent distance metrics the graph methods give always the same order of
functions. The lowest value is taken by the mean distance in the case of
LMST, the second is BMLP and the highest value is received by application
of the UMLP algorithm. This order is caused by an ”optimisation level”.
In the case of the LMST a new point on the graph can be added at every
graph node, in BMLP on one of both ends and in UMLP only on a one
end so that the variety of possibilities is decreasing thereby resulting in
less densly connected graph. Howether all function are very similar to each
other. Since chain algorithms are signiﬁcantly simpler numerically and the
received information is similar therefore it may be usefull to apply one of
the chain algorithms instead of building the MST or LMST tree.

and kurtosis of the distance between countries in the case of LMST, UMLP and
BMLP averaged over all G7 countries and the considered time interval as a function

5. Conclusions

The distance analysis consists in two steps. One is the choice of the dis-
tance metrics, the second is the graph analysis. It has been shown that the
results do not depend signiﬁcantly on the choice of the graph analysis, but
rather on the distance function. The mean distance between G7 countries
is increasing with the time window size in the case of the statistical and
discrete distance, while the application of the distribution distance results
in the opposite behaviour – the mean distance between countries is decreas-
ing with the time window size. In this situation it is extremely important
to choose properly the distance function, because there are diﬀerent advan-
tages to each of the used distance functions. The ﬁrst method Eq.(3), a
statistical distance, is specially sensitive to linear correlations. The discrete
Hilbert space Lq distance Eq.(4) can be applied to any data and does not
require any special properties of the data so this method seems to be very
useful for comparing various sets of data. However the window size should

warsz˙ﬁnal

not change in the analysis since it may inﬂuence signiﬁcantly the results.
The third method Eq.(5) is the most sophisticated one since it requires a
knowledge of the data distribution function, but then points out to similar-
ities between data statistical properties. The main disadvantage of the last
method is that it is sensitive to the size of the data set, since it requires
ﬁtting a distribution function. It is worth noticing that the results do not
depend signiﬁcantly on the choice of the graph analysis. Of course results
may diﬀer in details, but at the ﬁrst stage it is useful to apply one of the
chain methods (BMLP or UMLP) since they are much simpler than the
LMST especially from the numerical point of view. Thus may help in the
distance metrics choice. The optimal window size may be chosen on the
analysis of the statistical properties of the appropriate structure [6].

Various distance metrics have been investigated and new methods based
on diﬀerent distance metrics choice have been proposed in order to investi-
gate the correlations between G7 countries. These methods of mean distance
analyses could be also applied to stock market analysis.

The digital revolution of the information age and in particular the sweeping changes of scien-
tiﬁc communication brought about by computing and novel communication technology, potentiate
global, high grade scientiﬁc information for free. The arXiv for example is the leading scientiﬁc
communication platform, mainly for mathematics and physics, where everyone in the world has free
access on. While in some scientiﬁc disciplines the open access way is successfully realized, other
disciplines (e.g. humanities and social sciences) dwell on the traditional path, even though many
scientists belonging to these communities approve the open access principle. In this paper we try to
explain these diﬀerent publication patterns by using a game theoretical approach. Based on the as-
sumption, that the main goal of scientists is the maximization of their reputation, we model diﬀerent
possible game settings, namely a zero sum game, the prisoners’ dilemma case and a version of the
stag hunt game, that show the dilemma of scientists belonging to “non-open access communities”.
From an individual perspective, they have no incentive to deviate from the Nash Equilibrium of
traditional publishing. By extending the model using the quantum game theory approach it can be
shown, that if the strength of entanglement exceeds a certain value, the scientists will overcome the
dilemma and terminate to publish only traditionally in all three settings.

INTRODUCTION

In recent years the market of scientiﬁc publishing faces
several forces that may cause a major change of tradi-
tional market mechanisms. First of all, the increase of
digitalization brought a shift towards electronic publi-
cation. Furthermore, shrinking library budgets with a
simultaneous rise of journal prices resulted in massive
cancellations of journals and books [1, 2, 3, 4]. In conse-
quence of this still lasting journal crisis, alternative ways
of publishing, in particular open access, received increas-
ing attention [5, 6, 7]. Currently two main approaches
have emerged. On the one hand, new open access jour-
nals are brought to being, either through transformation
of traditional journals or through creation of new titles.
This approach is often called the Golden Road to Open
Access. On the other hand, authors may self-archive
their articles in Institutional Repositories, a model re-
ferred to as the Green Road to Open Access [8, 9].

The realization of open access publishing diﬀers be-
tween research disciplines [10]. The prime example of
an adoption of the open access publishing paradigm is
the arXiv server which is mainly used by physicists and
mathematicians. Researchers in this ﬁelds normally self-
archive their papers on the arXiv (so that everyone has
free access to the work) and often additionally submit
them to regular scientiﬁc journals, where these papers go
through the traditional peer review process. Thus the
arXiv-model represents neither exactly the golden nor
the green road of open access publishing.

In contrast most other scientiﬁc disciplines do not
make use of open access publishing, even though they
support this model if asked for [11, 12].
Instead, they
submit research papers to traditional journals that do
not provide free access to their articles. Considering that
the majority of scientists regard open access publishing
as superior to the traditional system, the question arises,
why it is only adopted by few disciplines.

Based on the assumption, that the main goal of scien-
tists is the maximization of their reputation, we try to
answer this question from the perspective of the produc-
ers of scientiﬁc information by using a game theoretical
approach. Scientiﬁc reputation originates mainly from
two diﬀerent sources: on the one hand the citations to
the articles of a scientist and on the other hand the repu-
tation of the journals he publishes his articles [13]. Start-
ing from a general 2-Scientists-Game, where two authors
have to decide whether they publish open access or not,
three diﬀerent possible game settings are developed. In
each case the outcome of the game results in a dilemma,
that cannot be solved within the static framework of clas-
sical game theory. Therefore we extend the model using
the quantum game theoretical approach and show, that if
choosing quantum strategies, the players can escape the
dilemma.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows.
In section II the open access game is developed using
the classical game theoretical notation. Firstly we deﬁne
the general reputation payoﬀ matrix of the game. The
three settings of the game cover a zero sum game, the

prisoners’ dilemma case, and a variation of the so called
stag hunt game. In section III, after a brief introduction
into the history of quantum game theory, we deﬁne the
basic notations of the quantum version of the open access
game and discuss the diﬀerent game settings in detail.
Our results are summarized in section IV.

II. THE CLASSICAL GAME OF OPEN ACCESS

A. Formalization of the Game

To describe the classical open access game we use a
normal-form representation of a two-player [29] game Γ
where each player (Player 1 ˆ= A, Player 2 ˆ= B) can
2 }, SB =
choose between two strategies (SA = {sA
{sB
2 }). In our case the two strategies represent the
authors’ choice between publishing open access (o) or not
(ø). The game tree can therefore be visualized as in Fig.
1.

FIG. 1: Classical tree of the open access game.

The whole strategy space S is composed with use of a
Cartesian product of the individual strategies of the two
players (scientists):

S = SA × SB = {(o,o), (o,ø), (ø,o), (ø,ø)}

(1)

As outlined in the introduction, we assume, that the main
objective of scientists is the maximization of their reputa-
tion. In the following we focus on a situation, where the
two scientists belong to a scientiﬁc community in which
the open access paradigm is not yet broadly adopted and
the publishers decline the acceptance of articles that are
already accessible on an open access server. The payoﬀ
structure of this game can be described by the following
matrix:

A\B

o

ø

o (r + δ,r + δ) (r − α,r + β)
ø (r + β,r − α)

(r,r)

TABLE I: General open access payoﬀ matrix.

to publish their papers only in traditional journals (ø,ø),
their reputation r does not change. If only one of the two
players chooses the open access strategy ((ø,o) or (o,ø))
the parameters α and β (α, β ≥ 0) describe the decrease
and the increase of the scientists’ reputation, depending
on the selected strategy. By modeling the payoﬀ in this
way, it is assumed that the reputation of the player, who
performs open access, decreases if the other player si-
multaneously decides not to publish open access. This
can be explained by the fact, that in “non-open access
communities” reputation is mainly deﬁned through the
reputation of the journals a scientist publishes in. Thus
if performing open access (by what a publication in tra-
ditional journals gets impossible), the scientist has no
chance to gain journal-related reputation any more. On
the other hand the parameter β describes the potential
increase of reputation of a scientist that refuses to per-
form open access while the other player selects the open
access strategy. By setting α = β the reputation is con-
sidered as a relative construct (see section II B 1). The
parameter δ represents the potential beneﬁt in the case
that both players choose the open access strategy (o,o).
The payoﬀ for each player then is r + δ.
In this case
it is assumed that if all players choose the open access
strategy the publishers are forced to accept articles for
publication even if they are already accessible. Then sci-
entists can gain reputation both through the reputation
of the journal they publish in and through the increase
of citations due to a broader accessibility [14, 15, 16].

In the following we will describe three speciﬁc param-

B. Potential Game Settings

1. Open Access as a Zero Sum Game

The most simple case of an open access game is realized
by setting the free parameters of the games’ payoﬀ matrix
to the following ﬁxed values: r = 0, δ = 0 and α =
β = 1. The starting reputation and the open access
beneﬁt of both players is set to zero, whereas the absolute
value of the increase (β) and decrease (α) in reputation
is taken to be equal. This setting therefore describes
reputation as a relative quantity. A potential increase in
reputation of one player results in an equivalent decrease
of the other player’s reputation. In this case, δ has to
be zero because the total amount of reputation in the
system cannot increase. The payoﬀ matrix of this setting
is illustrated in Table II.

eter settings of the open access game.

The actual reputation of the two scientists is repre-
sented by a single parameter r [30]. If both players decide

TABLE II: Open access payoﬀ matrix with reputation as a
relative quantity.

In this game each player has a dominant strategy (ø)
and the Nash equilibrium is (ø,ø). Therefore no player
has the incentive to deviate from the non-open access
strategy ø.

2. The Open Access Game as a Prisoners’ Dilemma

The game is similar to a classical prisoners’ dilemma,
if the assumption that reputation is a relative quantity is
partially abrogated. If both players choose the open ac-
cess strategy, the total amount of reputation will increase
by δ (δ > 0). In this case we have taken the following
parameter settings: r = 3, δ = 1 and α = β = 2. Table
III depicts the payoﬀ of both players.

o (4,4)

ø

TABLE III: Open access payoﬀ matrix within the prisoners’
dilemma setting.

Although the payoﬀ for both players would be higher if
they choose the strategy set (o,o), they are stuck within
the Nash equilibrium (ø,ø). This outcome describes the
paradox situation of many scientiﬁc disciplines: Scien-
tists on the one hand realize that they would beneﬁt, if
all players adopt open access, but on the other hand, no
player has an individual incentive to change.

3. Open Access as a “Stag Hunt” Game

The stag hunt game in its original meaning describes
the situation of two hunters, which have the choice be-
tween hunting a stag or a rabbit. If successful, bagging
a stag provides more beneﬁt than bagging a rabbit. The
problem within this game is that hunting a stag can only
be successful if both players go for the stag, whereas a
rabbit can be easily bagged by only one hunter. In our
case hunting a stag corresponds to the strategy of per-
forming open access, and the non-open access strategy
stands for hunting rabbits. Compared to the prisoners’
dilemma only the parameter β is modiﬁed. To formulate
the open access stag hunt game we have used the follow-
ing parameter settings: r = 3, δ = 1, α = 2 and β = 0
(see Table IV) [31].

setting.

In contrast to the other settings this game has two pure
Nash equilibria ((o,o) and (ø,ø)) and one mixed strat-
egy Nash equilibrium 2
3 (o,o). (o,o) is payoﬀ dominant,
whereas (ø,ø) is the risk dominant pure Nash equilibrium.
The mixed strategy Nash equilibrium 2
3 (o,o) implies that
one scientist has the incentive to choose non-open access
if he expects the probability of the other player to choose
non-open access as well, to be higher than 33.3 %.

In the following section we formulate the classical game
settings described above within a quantum game theoret-
ical framework.

III. THE QUANTUM GAME OF OPEN ACCESS

The basic principles of game theory were developed by
J. von Neumann in the year 1928. Together with O. Mor-
genstern he applied this new theory to economics [17].
In addition to this outstanding scientiﬁc contribution he
was also involved in the description of the mathematical
foundations of quantum theory [18]. Keeping these his-
torical facts in mind, it is surprising, that only recently
game theory and quantum physics has been uniﬁed to
one theory, the so called Quantum Game Theory.

The leadoﬀ articles of quantum game theory where
published by D. A. Meyer and J. Eisert et al. in the year
1999. Meyer illustrated a quantum version of the simple
“Penny Flip” game and showed, that if one player uses a
speciﬁc quantum strategy, whereas the other player per-
sists in a classical one, the player who selects the quan-
tum strategy will always win the game [19]. Just a few
weeks after Meyers’ article was published, Eisert et al.
focused on the well known prisoners’ dilemma [20], un-
knowing Meyers’ results. Within their quantum repre-
sentation they where able to demonstrate, that prisoners
could escape from the dilemma, if the entanglement of the
prisoners’ wave function is above a certain value. S. C.
Benjamin and P. M. Hayden ampliﬁed the formal descrip-
tion of quantum games towards many players [21]. L.
Marinatto and T. Weber applied the density matrix ap-
proach to the “Battle of Sexes” game and demonstrated,
that entangled strategies lead to a unique solution of the
game [22]. E. W. Piotrowski and J. Sladkowski disposed
quantum game theory to market behaviors [23]. In 2001
J. Du et al. realized the ﬁrst simulation of a quantum
game; the experimental results conﬁrmed their theoreti-
cal predictions [24]. Particularly they performed a pris-
oners’ dilemma quantum game on their nuclear magnetic
resonance quantum computer. Several other topics re-
garding quantum game theory have been addressed (e.g.
overviews are given in [25, 26, 27]).

In the following subsection we summarize the main
formal concepts of a two-player two-strategy quantum
game. We follow the description of Eisert et al. [20, 28]
and allow two parameter sets of quantum strategies [32].

A. Formalization of the Quantum Game

One can understand the concept of quantum strate-
gies as an enlargement of mixed strategies towards an
abstract complex strategy space. The measurable clas-
sical strategies (o and ø) correspond to the orthonormal
unit basis vectors |oi and |øi of the two dimensional com-
plex space C2, the so called Hilbert space Hi of the player
i (i = A, B). A quantum strategy of a player i is repre-
sented as a general unit vector |ψii in his strategic Hilbert
space Hi. The whole quantum strategy space H is con-
structed with the use of the direct tensor product of the
individual Hilbert spaces: H := HA ⊗ HB. The main
diﬀerence between classical and quantum game theory is,
that in the Hilbert space H correlations between the play-
ers’ individual quantum strategies are allowed, if the two
quantum strategies |ψiA and |ψiB are entangled. The
overall state of the system we are looking at is described
as a two-players quantum state |Ψi ∈ H. The four basis
vectors of the Hilbert space H are chosen to be equal to
the classical game outcomes (|ooi, |oøi, |øoi and |øøi).

The setup of the quantum game begins with the choice
of the initial state |Ψ0i. We assume that both players are
in the state |oi. The initial state of the two players is then
given by |Ψ0i = ˆJ |ooi, where the unitary operator ˆJ
is responsible for the possible entanglement of the two
player system. The players’ quantum decision (quantum
strategy) is formulated with the use of a two parameter
set of unitary 2 × 2 matrices:

ˆU(θ, ϕ) :=

ei ϕ cos( θ
2 )
−sin( θ
2 )
∀ θ ∈ [0, π] ∧ ϕ ∈ [0, π
2 ]

sin( θ
2 )
i ϕ cos( θ

e−

 

2 ) !

.

(2)

By arranging the parameters θ and ϕ a player is choos-
ing his quantum strategy. The classical strategy o for
example is selected by appointing θ = 0 and ϕ = 0 :

(3)

(4)

ˆo := ˆU(0, 0) =

1 0
0 1 !

 

,

whereas the strategy ø is selected by choosing θ = π and
ϕ = 0 :

ˆø := ˆU (π, 0) =

0 1
−1 0 !

 

.

The tree of the open access quantum game is dis-
played in Fig. 2. After the two players have chosen
their individual quantum strategies ( ˆUA := ˆU(θA, ϕA)
and ˆUB := ˆU(θB, ϕB)) the disentangling operator ˆJ † is
acting to prepare the measurement of the scientists’ state.
The entangling and disentangling operator ( ˆJ , ˆJ †; with
ˆJ ≡ ˆJ †) is depending on one additional single parameter
γ which is a measure of the entanglement of the system:

(cid:17)

The expected payoﬀ of the two scientists within the quan-
tum version of the open access game depends on the pay-
oﬀ matrix (see Table I) and on the joint probability to
observe the four possible outcomes of the game:

$A = (r + δ) Poo + (r − α) Poø + (r + β) Pøo + r Pøø
$B = (r + δ) Poo + (r + β) Poø + (r − α) Pøo + r Pøø

with: Pσσ, = | hσσ,|Ψf i |2 ,

σ, σ, = {o, ø}

.

To visualize the payoﬀs in a three dimensional diagram it
is neccessary to reduce the set of parameters in the ﬁnal
state: |Ψf i = |Ψf (θA, ϕA, θB, ϕB)i → |Ψf (tA, tB)i. We
have used the same speciﬁc parameterization as Eisert et
[20], where the two strategy angles θ and ϕ depend
al.
In our model
only on a single parameter t ∈ [−1, 1].
tA, tB = 1 corresponds to strategy ø, and tA, tB = 0
corresponds to strategy o. Negative t-values correspond
to quantum strategies, where ϕ > 0.

Fig. 3 shows the general structure of the separation
of strategy regions. The whole strategy space is sepa-
rated into four regions, namely the absolute classical re-
gion (CC: tA, tB ≥ 0), the absolute quantum region (QQ:
tA, tB < 0) and the two partially classical-quantum re-
gions (CQ: tA ≥ 0 ∧ tB < 0 and QC: tA < 0 ∧ tB ≥ 0).
In the following subsection we will present the main re-
sults of the diﬀerent game settings of the open access
quantum game. The outcomes of the diﬀerent games are
illustrated by visualizing the payoﬀ surfaces of scientist
A and scientist B as a function of their strategies tA and
tB.

B. Potential Game Settings

1. Open Access as a Zero Sum Quantum Game

Using the simple payoﬀ matrix (Table II) and the quan-
tum game formulation of section III A we have calculated
the expected payoﬀ for the two scientists with and with-
out entanglement. Fig. 4 depicts the expected payoﬀ

In the classical version of the game there exists one

The expected payoﬀ in this dominant strategy is equal
to zero for both players ($A(1, 1) = $B(1, 1) = 0, see Fig.
4). Because of the validity of the following conditions,
(ø,ø) is also a dominant strategy in the separable game:

The conditions (9) and (10) are easy to illustrate if one
examines Fig. 4. To visualize condition (9) for example,
one shall look at the intransparent surface and ﬁx an
arbitrary point on the surface, which is located on the
curve $A(1, tB) (with tB ∈ [−1, 1]). Condition (9) means,
that if one varies tA between all possible strategies (tA ∈
[−1, 1]), while keeping tB ﬁxed, the payoﬀ of player A
($A) will always decrease.
In a similar way, condition
(10) can be illustrated by considering the wired surface
$B(tA, tB).

Recapitulating the separable zero sum open access
quantum game, one can say that no changes to the classi-
cal game are observable. Due to the dominance of strat-
egy (ø,ø), both scientists will not perform open access.

The situation is entirely diﬀerent in the maximally
In Fig. 5(a) the ex-
entangled version of the game.
pected payoﬀ for scientist A ($A, intransparent surface)
and scientist B ($B, wired surface) is visualized; in con-
trast to Fig.
4 the players are maximally entangled
(γ = π
2 ). Because of the change in the payoﬀ surfaces,
the strategy (ø,ø) is neither a dominant strategy nor a
Nash equilibrium any more. For example, if player B
chooses the strategy ø, it would be advisable for player
A to select the strategy ˆUA(0, π/2) ˆ= (tA = −1).
In
contrast to the disappearance of the former Nash equi-
librium (ø,ø), new Nash equilibria are observed in the
maximally entangled game. The pure quantum strategy
ˆQ := ˆU (0, π/2) ˆ= (t = −1) for instance is a Nash equilib-

diﬀerence to the zero sum game, discussed in the previous
subsection, a dilemma occurs for both scientists. The
players again are imprisoned in the strategy set (ø,ø),
although a choice of (o,o) would be better for both of
them. Fig. 6 illustrates this quandary in a graphic way

By examining Fig. 5(a) one can see that all quantum

The results of the maximally entangled game show,
that if quantum strategies are allowed, the scientists are
not longer trapped in the strategy set (ø,ø). Nash equilib-
ria exist only if both players choose a quantum strategy
with tA, tB ≤ −0.5.

For partially entangled situations (0 < γ < π

boundary entanglement γ1 = π

the Nash equilibrium (ø,ø) fades to the quantum equi-
libria tA, tB ≤ −0.5. Fig. 5(b) depicts the partially
entangled quantum game, which is right at the edge of
dissolving the Nash equilibrium (ø,ø). For all γ ≤ π

the Nash equilibrium of the game is (ø,ø), whereas for
γ > π

mally entangled situation, although the range of the set
of quantum Nash equilibria is smaller and varies from

2. The Open Access Quantum Game as a Prisoners’
Dilemma

We now focus on an open access game with a payoﬀ
matrix similar to a prisoners’ dilemma (see Table III). In

In contrast to Fig. 4, where the strategy sets (o,o) and
(ø,ø) are on the same payoﬀ level ($A(o, o) = $A(ø, ø) =
0; same for player B), the payoﬀ magnitudes are now
diﬀerent ($A(o, o) = 4, $A(ø, ø) = 3; same for player

(tA, tB ≤ 0) has moved upwards and has a higher pay-
oﬀ than the dominant strategy (ø,ø). There is again no
diﬀerence between the classical outcome of the game and
the separable quantum version: (ø,ø) remains to be a
dominant strategy.

Increasing the entanglement factor γ to higher values
leads to a qualitative change in the outcome of the game,
if its value overruns γ1 := 2 arctan( √3

). For γ1 < γ the

strategy (ø,ø) ceases to be a unique dominant strategy,
however (ø,ø) remains to be a Nash equilibrium if the
entanglement-factor lies in the range γ1 < γ ≤ γ2 := π
4 .
In this range, there exist two Nash equilibria, namely the
former Nash equilibrium (ø,ø) and a new quantum Nash
equilibrium ( ˆQA, ˆQB), which corresponds to (tA = −1,
tB = −1). Fig. 7 shows the payoﬀ surfaces for both

increases γ, the strategy (ø,ø) even ceases to be a Nash
equilibrium. For example, if γ > γ2 and player B chooses
the strategy ø, the best reward for player A would be the
quantum strategy ˆQA. Fig. 8 depicts the payoﬀ surfaces
for both players for γ = γ2. For γ > γ2 there exists only
the quantum Nash equilibrium ( ˆQA, ˆQB), as one can see
by looking at the maximally entangled situation (Fig. 9).

It should be mentioned, that our results are diﬀer-
ent from the results presented in [20] and [24], which
is due to a diﬀerent payoﬀ matrix. For the separable
and maximally entangled game there is no qualitative
diﬀerence in the outcomes, whereas we want to point
out, that we ﬁnd diﬀerent Nash equilibria for the par-
tially entangled games (see Fig. 7, 8). J. Du et al.
found the two Nash equilibria (( ˆQ,ø) and (ø, ˆQ)) for

that if one extends a prisoners’ dilemma into a quantum

3. Open Access as a Stag Hunt Quantum Game

In contrast to the other separable games discussed in
the previous subsections, the stag hunt quantum version
of the open access game even shows advantages of us-
ing quantum strategies in the separable situation, where

both players always lies above or equal to all other pay-
oﬀ values (see Fig. 10(a)). In addition to the three clas-
sical Nash equilibria ((ø,ø), (o,o) and 2
3 (o,o)), a set of
new quantum Nash equilibria can be observed within
the separable quantum game (tA, tB < 0). All quan-
tum strategies that lie on the QQ-plane of Fig. 10(a),
ensure an identical, rather high payoﬀ for both players
($A(QQ) = $B(QQ) = 4). Because of the absence of
a dominant strategy and the complex structure of Nash
equilibria, it is diﬃcult to predict the outcome of the
game. A risk conducted player may prefer the strategy
ø, because this will guarantee him a payoﬀ of 3. A payoﬀ
conducted player might be guided by the possibility of
getting a greater payoﬀ, and therefore will prefer either
strategy o, or a quantum strategy t < 0. The mixed
strategy Nash equilibrium 2
3 (o,o) can be visualized if one
examines the surfaces from a viewpoint parallel to the
strategy space of player A (see Fig. 10(b)). The char-
acter of a mixed Nash equilibrium (t⋆
B) is that the
gradients of the payoﬀ surfaces vanish:

3 (o,o) and ( ˆQA, ˆQB). Although (ø,ø)
cur, namely (ø,ø), 2
technically remains to be a Nash equilibrium, no rational
acting player would choose such a strategy, because the
alternative of the quantum strategy ˆQ would give him in
any case a better or equal payoﬀ:

Quantum Strategy:
$A( ˆQA, tB) ≥ 3 ∧ $B(tA, ˆQB) ≥ 3 ∀ tA, tB ∈ [−1, 1]
Non-Open Access:
$A(ø, tB) ≤ 3 ∧ $B(tA, ø) ≤ 3 ∀ tA, tB ∈ [−1, 1]

Furthermore it should be mentioned, that for all types of
entanglement the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium 2
3 (o,o)
persists at its former position.

In summary, we conclude that the players of a maxi-
mally entangled stag hunt quantum game will be in favor
of performing the quantum strategy ˆQ over the non-open
access strategy ø.

C. Manifestation of Quantum Strategies

We want to point out, that the measurable choice of
the quantum strategy ˆQ in reality does not necessarily
appear as the strategy o – albeit, if both players will
choose ˆQ, the measured outcome will be (o,o). To illus-
trate the role of entanglement and the nature of quantum
strategies, we have ﬁxed the strategy of scientist B to
ˆUB = ˆU(π, 0) = ø, whereas we choose the strategy of sci-
entist A to be a quantum strategy ˆUA = ˆU (θA, π
2 ). Fig.
12 displays the payoﬀ for the players A and B as a func-
tion of θA and γ. Fig. 12(a) depicts the calculations for
the prisoners’ dilemma game, whereas Fig. 12(b) shows

the results within the stag hunt quantum game. If the
scientists’ strategies are not entangled (γ = 0), the best
respond for player A in the prisoners’ dilemma game is
the choice of θA = π, which would result in the classical
Nash equilibrium (ø,ø), giving both players the payoﬀ 3.
In contrast, if we focus on a situation where the scien-
tists’ strategies are maximally entangled (γ = π
2 ), the
best respond for scientist A is θA = 0, giving him a pay-
oﬀ of 5 and player B a payoﬀ of 1. Player B could be
amazed about his little payoﬀ. To understand the real
cause, we need to examine the joint probabilities of the
measurable outcomes of the game. If player B selects the
classical strategy ø and player A chooses the quantum
strategy ˆQ, the joint probabilities result in the following
outcomes:

| hoo|Ψf i |2 = | høø|Ψf i |2 = 0 ,

(12)

| hoø|Ψf i |2 = cos (γ)2 ,

| høo|Ψf i |2 = sin (γ)2

.

In Fig. 13 the non-zero probabilities | hoø|Ψf i |2 and
| høo|Ψf i |2 are plotted against the scientists’ entangle-
ment γ. The cause of the amazement of player B is that
even though he chooses the strategy ø, the probability of
measuring ø is zero if the entanglement γ is maximal. By
using the quantum strategy ˆQ player A is able to switch
the choice of player B. Within an entangled quantum
game, it is not feasible to insist on a classically chosen
strategy.

access game. By calculating the outcome of the games
within a classical game theoretical framework, we have
shown that in all cases the scientists face a dilemma
situation: Considering a potential loss in reputation,
incentives to perform open access are missing. These
ﬁndings change, if quantum strategies are allowed.
If
the entanglement overruns a certain barrier, quantum
strategies become superior to the former Nash equilib-
rium strategies.
In none of the three diﬀerent game
settings the choice of traditional publishing remains to
be a rational strategy for the players, if their strategical
choices are maximally entangled. The results of this
article therefore indicate one possible explanation of the
diﬀering publishing methods of scientiﬁc communities.
In quantum game theory parlance one would say, that
like mathematics and physics,
scientiﬁc disciplines,
which had been successful in realizing the open access
model, consist of scientists, whose strategical operations
are strongly entangled.
if a scientiﬁc
community is still imprisoned in the Nash equilibrium of
non-open access, there would be a lack of entanglement
between the strategical choices of the related scientists
of the community.

In contrast,

IV. SUMMARY

Acknowledgments

This article focuses the question why the open access
model is only successfully adopted by a few scientiﬁc
disciplines. We have constructed a game theoretical
model, where the scientists’ incentives where described
with a reputation dependent payoﬀ matrix. Three game
settings where addressed, namely a zero sum game, the
prisoners’ dilemma and a stag hunt version of the open

as an overall construct of the probabilistic choice of the
whole scientiﬁc community in which A is embedded.
[30] By using this formalization, we assume that both scien-
tists are on a similar level of reputation. It can be shown
that if they have diﬀerent “starting” reputation values,
the outcome of the classical game would be the same.
[31] In contrast to the original stag hunt game, where hunting
a stag alone results in a payoﬀ of zero, in this case the
single open access performer gets a payoﬀ of 1, simply
because a reputation value of zero is unrealistic. A rep-
utation value of zero only makes sense, if reputation is
seen as a relative quantity (see section II B 1).

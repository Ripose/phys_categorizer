Abstract

In this work the results of a bottleneck experiment with pedestrians are
presented in the form of total times, ﬂuxes, speciﬁc ﬂuxes, and time gaps.
A main aim was to ﬁnd the dependence of these values from the bottleneck
width. The results show a linear decline of the speciﬁc ﬂux with increasing
width as long as only one person at a time can pass, and a constant value
for larger bottleneck widths. Differences between small (one person at a
time) and wide bottlenecks (two persons at a time) were also found in the
distribution of time gaps.

Introduction

Bottlenecks are of interest in many systems as trafﬁc [1–4], the internet [5], the
ASEP [6, 7], evolution theory [8] and a lot more. A bottleneck typically denomi-
nates a limited area (in a general sense) of reduced capacity or increased demand
(e.g. on-ramps on highways). This capacity reduction can be due to a forced speed
reduction (speed limit in trafﬁc), a reduced movement probability (ASEP, tunnel
effect), a reduced bias or correlation in a dynamic process (ASEP, correlated ran-
dom walks), or a direct capacity reduction (networks, blocked highway lanes). For
pedestrians bottlenecks are usually formed by direct capacity reduction (door or
corridor).

Bottlenecks are of fundamental importance in the calculation of evacuation
times and other observables for buildings. This directly implies the need to under-
stand the phenomenons that occur in junction with bottlenecks quite well to build
reliable (simulation) models of pedestrian movement. Therefore there has been

1

increasing interest into pedestrian ﬂow through bottlenecks in recent years [9–19].
Often such research has as one aim the construction of models of pedestrian dy-
namics or to create data or tools to validate such models. One set of very basic tests
that aim at giving authorities and applicants criteria to evaluate such simulation
models can be found in [20]. Deciding in what situations a precise reproduction of
reality is essential is one thing, knowing the reality of these situations another. In
the present situation there are much more simulation models ( [21–40] to mention
just a few) than empirically well investigated test scenarios. The present study aims
at closing this gap a little bit.

The outline of this paper is as follows. First the scenario is described in terms of
the geometrical layout. Then the group of participants is described. The sequence
of runs - in terms of the bottleneck’s widths - might also be of some importance
and concludes the description of the experimental setting. The section “Results”
begins with an analysis of the starting phase and starting effects. From total times
over ﬂuxes, speciﬁc ﬂuxes to the distribution of time gaps the results then proceed
from macroscopic to microscopic data.

2 Experimental Setting

2.1 The Geometrical Layout

The experiment follows test scenario 4 of [20] but exceeds it in the amount of as-
pects considered. It took place in a building at the campus Duisburg of Duisburg-
Essen University from 3 pm to 5 pm on the 15th of Mai 2006. The bottleneck was
formed by two cabinets with a height of two meters and a depth of 40 centimeters.
Note that especially compared to the experiments reported about in [9, 11], this
bottleneck with a depth of 40 cm is rather short, i.e. it is rather comparable to a
door than a corridor. The space in front of the bottleneck was about 4 meter wide
and 9 meter deep with a slight increase of the width toward the back wall. At the
beginning of each run, the participants stood right in front of the bottleneck, there
was no noteworthy free space between them and the bottleneck. The process was
videotaped from above (see ﬁgure 1) and from the side. For analysis only the for-
mer one was used. The time distance between two frames and therefore the time
resolution is 0.033367 seconds. Higher time resolutions would have been possible,
yet it becomes difﬁcult at some point to distinguish between “person has not yet
passed” and “person has passed” if the frames are too similar. The criterion for
“person has passed” was when the ﬁrst frame showed that the head of a participant
fully crossed the line shown in ﬁgure 1. The evaluation was done manually and not
automatically by some software. In many cases it was easy for two counting people
to agree about in which frame a person had passed the bottleneck. However, there

also were ambiguities, where it was not easy to judge whether a participant had
passed in one frame or only later in the next one. Ten different widths of the bottle-

neck were examined: 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 120, 140 and 160 centimeter. For
each reconﬁguration the width was measured with a laser distance measurement
device and accepted if the difference to the exact value was 2 millimeter or below.
The cabinets were weighed down (> 300 kg) to the point that the possibility of a
displacement during a run was excluded.

2.2 The Participants

The majority of the 94 participants were students at Duisburg-Essen University
(32 female, 62 male). Thus the group was rather homogeneous concerning age
(six born before 1978, one after 1990, most around 1984) and level of ﬁtness.
Concerning body height there was a “female frequency peak” around 170 cm and
a “male frequency peak” around 180 cm with approximately ten guys being taller
than 190 cm.

The participants have been told to be vigilant and not to dawdle, but that they
should not think of a competition or an emergency situation. The homogeneity of
the group must let one suspect that they are able to estimate each other’s behavior
quite well, which probably led to comparatively small time gaps. The fact that most

of the participants are in the age of maximal physical ﬁtness as well as maximal
reactivity will probably have had the same effect.

Concerning the homogeneity of the group: one will probably quite often ﬁnd
groups (deﬁned by spatial proximity) that are signiﬁcantly more homogeneous than
a random sample of the society. There is most often a reason, why individuals meet
and move within groups and these reasons often have a selecting effect. In fact it is
not implausible to assume that subsets of the population that are truly representative
only rarely gather autonomously.

2.3 The Sequence of Runs

The sequence of runs is shown in table 1. For the bottleneck width of 100 cm, six

repetitions were done for two reasons: 1) The participants were to get used to the
situation, especially to being ﬁlmed and 2) 100 cm is the width mentioned in [20].
For 120 cm an extra run was done unintentionally.

3 Results

During the planning process the aim was to have 100 participants. As ﬁnally 94
participants came to take part in the experiment, the idea was to ﬁll the gap by
telling the ﬁrst six persons to walk around the cabinets in some distance and pass
the bottleneck again. However due to the noise of the crowd this did not work out
well in each case and so in the following the results considering the ﬁrst 80 and -
where possible - the ﬁrst 100 persons are given.

The most direct measurement is the total time from the ﬁrst to the last partic-
ipant crossing the line shown in ﬁgure 1. This implies, that the total time is the
sum of n − 1 time gaps, if there are n participants. The ﬂux then simply is the
inverse of the total time multiplied by the number of persons that walked through
the bottleneck in this time. The speciﬁc ﬂux is the ﬂux divided by the bottleneck
width. Finally the distribution and evolution of time gaps - the time distances be-
tween subsequent persons - will be given. But ﬁrst the analysis will begin with the
starting phase and therefore - to have a sufﬁciently detailed perspective - also with
a look at the time gaps.

3.1 The Starting Phase

The question is whether the process needs some time to become static or if the
measured observables are the same from start to end. A standard assumption would
be an exponential relaxation of the time gaps TG following equation (1).

˜TG(t) = a exp (−bt) + c.

The large dispersion of the data does not necessarily select the function of equation
(1) and exclude other ones.
It was chosen for reasons of simplicity as well as
comparability to [11]. The results for the three parameters are shown in table 2
and for two of them together with the original data and smoothed functions ˆTG(t)
(following equation (2)) in ﬁgures 2.

with t in steps of 0.1 seconds, Nmax being the number of measurements and τ
freely set to τ = 1 second or τ = 10 seconds.

The large dispersion of measurements and the fact that no trend is recognizable
concerning the dependence of a and b on the bottleneck width make the results
for the parameters a and b seem to be not very reliable. The negative value of
b at 100 and 120 cm indicate, that there is either no relaxation tendency for the
ﬁrst 100 participants or that at least if there is such a tendency it is obscured by
another effect. The positive values for a and the negative ones for b have different
causes for 100 and 120 cm . While for 120 cm this is probably caused by the
tailback described at the beginning of the next section, this cannot be the cause
at a width of 100 cm, since even for the ﬁrst 18 seconds the ﬁt revealed positive
a and negative b. In addition, there is another local RMS-minimum for a width

a exp (−bt) + c for the widths 40 and 120 cm. The numerical values for a, b, and c
can be found in table 2. The smoothing of the blue and green curve has been done
using a Gaussian weight dependent on the time distance between the considered
point in time and the time of the time gap (see equation (2)).

of 100 cm at a = −0.618, b = 3.685 and c = 0.563 with a RMS only slightly
smaller than for the result given in table 2 and thus a sharp and quick relaxation
on a time scale of 1/b = 0.27 s, which is less than most time gaps. The most
likely conclusion seems that for 100 cm there is neither a relaxation tendency nor
some exponential increase. Due to the short time in which the runs for 120 cm
are completed, besides the tailback a second reason for the evolution of time gaps
at 120 cm could in principle be that the relaxation has not been completed before
all participants have passed.
In this case, however, one would expect that this
trend somehow can already be identiﬁed for 100 or even 80 cm and thus would
expect different results for 80 and 100 cm than have actually been measured: b is
comparatively large for 80 cm and a is much smaller for all other widths than 120
cm.

For parameter c however, there is a nice trend except for the result for a width
of 120 cm. As for positive b c is the static average on the long run, it is the pa-
rameter which should be easiest to ﬁt. a and b are meant to show the deviation
from the static process in the beginning. Therefore a much larger fraction of the
measurements can be used to ﬁt c compared to a and b.

Another possibility to estimate the time dependence of the time gaps is to watch
the evolution of the average time gap between person n − 1 and person n. Averag-
ing over six (100 cm) or three (rest) runs leads to far too large ﬂuctuations to tell
something about starting effects. Therefore one has to average over a few consec-
utive time gaps. A running average sample size of ﬁve was chosen. For smaller
sample sizes the ﬂuctuations were too large and for larger sample sizes possible
starting effects might be averaged out too much. Figure 3 shows no starting effects
with a possible exception at a bottleneck width of 100 cm. Or if there are trends
in the beginning, they are not stronger than ﬂuctuations that appear later on. Since
the ﬂuctuations remain larger than possible starting effects throughout the process
anyway, there seems to be no need to take starting effects into account.

Figure 3: Running averages with a sample size of ﬁve. The upper diagram includes
data of just one run, while for the lower one at ﬁrst an average of the i-th time gaps
of all runs of a certain bottleneck width has been done. A data point at position
(i/ ¯TG) therefore has the meaning, that the average of the time gaps i − 4 to i was
¯TG.

3.2 Total Times

If - as a ﬁrst assumption - one assumes a linear increase of the ﬂux with the bottle-
neck width, the total time is expected to depend like

T ≈ c/(w − w0) + t1

(3)

on the bottleneck width w, with w0 as minimal bottleneck width where passage is
possible, t1 the time for one person to pass the bottleneck, and c as some constant.
If one neglects the depth of the bottleneck (a person needs no time to cross the
line), one can set t1 = 0. This is what is assumed in this work: The total time for
N persons consists of N − 1 time gaps between consecutive persons.

Figure 4 shows a decrease of the total time until the bottleneck width reaches
120 cm. That the decrease does not continue for wider bottlenecks is not only due
to a normal 1/w behavior, which comes close to its static value, but at least partly
due to participants who did not leave the area behind the bottleneck fast enough.
The available area behind the bottleneck and the possibilities to leave this area were
not sufﬁcient to guarantee a fast efﬂux of the participants at those large bottleneck
widths. Therefore the ﬂux through the bottleneck is not limited by the bottleneck
itself, but by a tailback. Figure 3 very clearly shows this effect. One can even guess
quite precisely at what time the tailback reached the bottleneck. In other words:
The bottleneck stopped being a bottleneck for widths of 120 cm and above, in a
sense that the participants - due to some obstacles - couldn’t leave the area behind
the bottleneck fast enough to allow those passing the bottleneck to do this as fast as
they could. Figure 5 shows the total times for those bottleneck widths for which a
linear approximation appears to be possible. Please note that this is not a claim that
there actually is a linear dependence of the total time on the bottleneck width. This
- for reasons stated above - would not be possible over the whole range of widths
anyway. Nevertheless an almost constant decrease of the total time should not be
possible in a range from 50 or even 40 to 100 cm, if one assumes equation (3) to
be correct, even if one assumes w0 = 20 cm, which would be rather small.

3.3 Fluxes

Figure 6 shows the ﬂuxes of all runs. One of the ﬁrst things noticeable is the
increase in variation for bottleneck widths of 100 cm and above. This has at least
two reasons: The ﬁrst is trivial, as there were six instead of three runs. Second, one
has to remember that the experiment started with a width of 100 cm. Maybe there
has been some learning effect at the beginning of the experiment. The rather large
variation of results for a width of 120 cm and the development of the speciﬁc ﬂuxes
during the 100 cm runs shown in ﬁgure 7 neither fully support nor fully exclude

Figure 4: Total times for all runs.

Figure 5: Total times for bottleneck widths between 40 and 100 cm.

this possibility. And third there could indeed be a larger variation for widths of
100 cm and above that is reproducible in further experiments independently of the
sequence of runs or other factors.

Figure 6: Fluxes for all runs.

An interesting observation can be made in ﬁgure 8, where the data region is
conﬁned to bottleneck widths up to 100 cm. There seems to be some deviation
from linearity: The speciﬁc ﬂux (the slope in ﬁgure 8) appears to be smaller for
bottleneck widths of 60 cm and below than for larger widths. This will now be
examined in more detail. Further discussion of the ﬂux itself will be made in
section 4, where it is compared to the results of other experiments.

3.4 Speciﬁc Fluxes

The diagram of speciﬁc ﬂuxes (ﬁgure 9) shows a decrease until a width of 70 cm. It
follows a plateau (see ﬁgure 11) or maybe even an small increase (see ﬁgures 9 and
10). A non-monotonic evolution is something one would not expect. Reasons for
this could hardly be found. Furthermore one probably would rather trust a diagram
showing the averages (plateau) than one with a large dispersion of results (showing
what could be interpreted as small increase). So it seems more probable that it is
a plateau with ﬂuctuations unveiling a minimum by chance. Why in spite of this it
might be that there is an unincisive minimum is discussed in subsection 3.5.

For small bottleneck widths of 60 cm and below the speciﬁc ﬂux increases since
the participants actively increase their width usage efﬁciency by rotating their body

Figure 7: Speciﬁc ﬂuxes (from the “80 persons data”) for the six runs with a bot-
tleneck width of 100 cm in the chronological order of the runs. From this it can
neither be excluded nor conﬁrmed that there is a learning effect. So it is very
hard to decide whether the wider variation of results for 100 cm compared to the
other widths is due to a systematic drift during the experiment, or due to normal
statistical variation and the larger number of runs.

to the side. The reduction in the speciﬁc ﬂux above 100 cm on the contrary surely
is caused by the tailback, but maybe also by the participants not actively taking
care of efﬁcient motion, as the task of walking through a wide “bottleneck” may
appear to be too simple to exert.

3.5 Bottleneck Width 70 cm

While for all other widths it appeared that the participants did not need to commu-
nicate before passage, hesitation caused by communication appeared a number of
times at a width of 70 cm, as is shown in ﬁgure 12. This specialty of a width of 70
cm was already noticed by several people enlisted in the organization of the exper-
iment and later conﬁrmed from the video footage. The reason for this is, that at a
width of 80 cm the participants, while walking, displaced in a zipper-principle-like
way: One participant rather on the left side, then one rather on the right side and
again one rather to the left. For widths of 90 cm or above two or more participants
were able to pass at the same time, sometimes, however, this was even possible
at 80 cm. For widths smaller than 60 cm typically only one participant at a time
passed. The transgression from two-at-once over zipper-principle to one-by-one
at a width of 70 cm then caused those difﬁculties, as this appears to be the only
width, where it is not obvious that typically only one person at a time can pass. So
the reason for delay is not the time needed for communicate about earlier passage.
If this was the case, the speciﬁc ﬂux should be reduced for smaller bottlenecks

Figure 12: Two participants dawdling in front of a 70 cm bottleneck.

even more. The true reason is the late awareness that communication is necessary
and the communication therefore falls into a time when passing would already be
possible, leading to a dawdling phenomenon.

It is interesting to compare this phenomenon to the results of [18]. There the
evacuation time for competitive behavior quite sharply decreses between 70 and
80 cm and the evacuation time for non-competitve behavior increases slightly be-
tween 60 and 70 cm door width. One would have to compare the recordings to tell
whether these two effects can be related to the need of communication about earlier
passage. But in principle one could interpret this in the following way: If there is
the need to communicate about earlier passage, the participants do so in the non-
competitive scenario, which leads to dawdling effects. In the competitive scenario,
however, they do not. This leads to some friction-like phenomenon which compen-
sates or even overcompensates the increased speed which follows from the higher
motivation. As soon as there is no more need for communication the higher moti-
vation in the competitive scenario can fully unfold and leads to smaller evacuation
times than in the non-competitive scenario.

3.6 Time Gaps

3.6.1 Distribution of Time Gaps

The distribution of time gaps (ﬁgures 13 and 14) outlines what has already been de-
scribed in the last subsection. Where the process was a strict one-by-one sequence,
the distribution looks rather symmetrical with a more or less distinct maximum at
the center. The larger the width becomes, the ﬂatter gets the distribution. It extends
more to smaller time gaps, as passing the bottleneck side by side - in principle with
a time gap of zero seconds - becomes possible.

Figure 13: Distribution of time gaps: small bottleneck widths. The partitioning of the time gap categories is done such that
each category contains two frames.

Apart from this observations, the averages, standard deviations, skewnesses

and kurtoses of the time gaps can be found in table 3.

The numbers of table 3 exhibit...

... as expected an inversely proportional dependence of the average time gap of

the bottleneck width.

... in parallel to the development of the speciﬁc ﬂux a considerable variation
of the product (bottleneckwidth) · (averagetimegap) over the different
widths (0.46 ms for 40 cm and 0.57 ms for 70 cm).

... an agreement of the average with the regression parameter c (compare table

2) that is better for small widths.

... standard deviations that become larger as soon as the zipper-principle ap-
plies. The reason for the standard deviation at 40 cm being larger than the
ones of 50 and 60 cm might be, that for 40 cm the body size plays an impor-
tant role in the effort of passing the bottleneck.

... mostly positive skewness which means - compared to the normal distribution

- many small (normal behavior) and a few large time gaps (dawdling).

... mostly positive kurtoses which means a sharper maximum than in the normal
distribution. The exception at 80 cm might be a reﬂection of the second peak
visible in ﬁgure 14, indicating the two modes: two people side by side or one
person walking in the middle, claiming the bottleneck alone. If one takes the
values for 120 cm for granted, the kurtoses exhibit minima each 40 cm (at 40,
80 and 120 cm). One can suspect, that a small kurtosis exhibits a “perfect
ﬁt” of a certain number of lanes into the bottleneck. However, this needs
conﬁrmation from other experiments.

4 Comparison to Similar Studies

There is a number of studies which are related in some point or another to this one.
These studies exceed what is reported in the following, yet the focus is on those
parts that are comparable to this experiment. In [16] the results of an evacuation
exercise of a classroom are reported. The door in that experiment had a width of
50 cm. The maximal efﬂux was found to be as large as approximately 2 persons
per second. In the present experiment at a width of 50 cm an average ﬂux of almost
exactly 1 person per second (compare ﬁgure 6) was measured and only one single
time gap (compare ﬁgure 13) was smaller than 0.5 seconds. This implies that the
ﬂux observed in [16] as stable ﬂux over a few seconds appeared only as an extreme
value in the present experiment. This factor of 2 can be explained in its tendency,
yet it might still appear surprisingly large: If the students were very young and far
from being full-grown (as the focus is on the comparison with simulation results,
neither the age nor the grade of the participants are stated) they would have used the
available width even more efﬁciently than the students in the present experiment.
The second reason might be that the depth of the door might have been noticeably
smaller than 40 cm, allowing the pupils to wind around the bottleneck borders more
efﬁciently than the students of the present study.

This is a suiting keyword to proceed to a comparison with [9]. In that experi-
ment the ﬂow through a bottleneck with a depth of 5 meter and different widths (1
and 2 meter) was measured. From the measurements it was concluded, that the ﬂux
is a step function with respect to the bottleneck width. This is something that could
not be observed in the present experiment (compare ﬁgure 6). This is probably not
due to the small overlap of widths (0.4 to 1.2 meter compared to 1.0 to 2.0 meter
there) but either to the largely different depth (0.4 meter here compared to 5.0 me-
ter there) or the conclusion of a step-function is not justiﬁed. The probability that
the steps are obscured by the steps in which the bottleneck width was increased
in the present experiment can be assumed to be very small. Aside from that for a
bottleneck width of 1 meter a ﬂux of 1.774 persons per second is reported. This
is the result from a model calculation that is assumed to be in agreement with the
measurement. Compared to the 1.33 persons/(m s) of [20] or the 4 persons/(m s)
of [16] this result is quite close to the 1.85 (resp. 1.89) persons per second (com-
pare ﬁgure 11 of the present work. The difference can maybe be understood as
stemming from the participants, who are representative for the population in the
experiment of [9].

The study most similar to the present one is probably [11] (participants: stu-
dents, normal behavior), where between 20 and 60 participants walked through a
bottleneck with a depth of 2.8 meter and widths between 0.8 and 1.2 meter. Aside
the depth, differences to the present experiment include that the borders of the bot-

tleneck could be overlooked by all participants and that the participants closest to
the bottleneck started 3 meter ahead of it. Thus there may have been some kind
of sorting (faster ones reach the bottleneck earlier) and maybe even some kind of
“confusion” as the participants form the queue immediately in front of the bot-
tleneck. In any case is this difference in the initial condition most probably the
reason for the difference in the distinctness of the starting phase. With λ having
the same meaning as the b from subsection 3.1, for the time gaps the difference
with 0.16 < λ < 1.00 compared to 0.01 < |b| < 0.20 becomes evident. Concern-
ing the ﬂux there is quite a good agreement between both experiments. Especially
if one considers the difference from the two ways to calculate the ﬂux that is ex-
hibited in [11]. There seems to be a tendency that for small widths the ﬂux in the
present experiment is larger, while for larger widths it is larger in [11]. An expla-
nation might be, that for a short bottleneck the participants have more possibilities
to increase their performance in the case of narrow bottlenecks.

In another study [12] (participants: students, normal behavior) a signiﬁcant de-
pendence of the average ﬂux from the initial density was found. The maximum
efﬂux was measured for an initial density of 5 persons per square meter: approxi-
mately 3.3 persons per second for a width of 120 cm and approximately 1.7 persons
per second for a width of 40 cm, which in the latter cases is almost twice as large as
the result of the present experiment, but - in terms of the speciﬁc ﬂux - not as large
as the ﬂux in [41] (see below for details) when a column is part of the scenario. It
is particularly interesting, that the speciﬁc ﬂux (4.25 p./(m s) for 40 cm and 2.75
p./(m s) for 120 cm) is larger for the smaller width, which is in agreement with the
present experiment, however the relative difference is even larger in the experiment
of [12] than in the present one.

As is stated in the introduction, the participants were remembered in the begin-
ning, that the experiment is not a competition. Consequently, the experiment didn’t
exhibit any competitive characteristics. Creating [42] a situation that is competitive
in some respect, however, is necessary to evoke maladaptive behavior in the sense,
that the density in front of the bottleneck rises to values where the ﬂow through
the bottleneck is reduced [43, 44] signiﬁcantly. Therefore, the present experiment
neither examined this regime, nor does it make any claim about the probability and
requirements for a bottleneck situation going “sub-optimal”. However, contrary
to the claim that panic-like situations reduce the efﬂux, the results of an experi-
ment [41], where the participants were told to “force their way through the bottle-
neck as fast as possible” exhibit considerably smaller average time gaps than the
present experiment (compare table 2 of [41] with table 3). The smallest average
time gap (door width 82 cm) was found to be as small as 0.275 s, which is only a
fraction of 0.39 of the overall average of 0.70 s for a width of 80 cm of the present
experiment and it implies a speciﬁc ﬂux as large as 4.43 persons per meter and

second. For the panic experiments 1-6 (without obstacle) of [41] the absolute val-
ues of the standard deviations - rather than the relative ones - of the time gaps are
comparable to the one stated in table 3.

5 Summary, Conclusions, and Outlook

In this work results of a bottleneck experiment with pedestrians were presented.
Due to the participants being mostly in their twenties, comparatively large ﬂuxes
could be observed. To be precise: all speciﬁc ﬂuxes were found to be larger than
1.33 persons/(m s), which is a value given in [20], comparable to those of [9, 11],
but smaller than those found in [12, 16, 41]. If one takes all of the results together,
one ﬁnds, that the speciﬁc ﬂux seems to increase both with the motivation as well
as the initial density. This might be in contradiction with [43] and the simulations
of [44], where a reduction of the ﬂux for large densities and/or over-motivation
(panic) is reported. This contradiction could be resolved by assuming, that neither
the initial density in [12] nor the motivation in [41] were large enough to reduce
the ﬂux. Another possibility would be that arching and clogging exist for large
initial densities and strong motivation, but they do not overcompensate the effects
of initial density and motivation themselves. This is, what is assumed in [12],
where the saturation of the ﬂux at large initial densities is attributed to clogging
and not to the maximal capacity of the bottleneck. Third, in principle there could
be some maximum which has not been measured yet. Appealing to the participants
to go as fast as possible as group (i.e. minimize the total time) might help [42] to
measure such a maximum, if it really exists.

Sometimes it is claimed explicitly [9], sometimes assumed implicitly [45], that
the ﬂux is a step function of the bottleneck width. This is something that is def-
initely not conﬁrmed for bottlenecks with a smaller depth by the results of this
work. While in principle it could be that there is a step function for the ﬂux at
deeper bottlenecks and a rather linear function for bottlenecks with depths com-
pared to the one examined here, the agreement of this work with [11] excludes the
step function.

The speciﬁc ﬂux was found to be not a constant with regard to the width, but to
increase with declining bottleneck width for widths smaller 70 cm. This can most
probably be imputed to the participants moving more efﬁciently by rotating their
body ellipse when passing the bottleneck. This rotating of the body ellipse will
probably not occur for bottlenecks where the depth is that large that more than one
or two lateral steps are necessary to pass the bottleneck.

Only a minor if not even no starting effect could be found insofar as its ampli-

tude is much smaller than the typical variation of measurements.

It would be very interesting to repeat the experiment with participants mostly
older than 60 years, with a heterogeneous group or with a signiﬁcant percentage
of persons carrying luggage (airports). Another idea would be to examine the in-
ﬂuence of the bottleneck depth, which has been 40 cm in this work. While there
have already been cited some works [11, 17] where bottlenecks with depths other
than 40 cm have been examined, the depth was never varied systematically in one
single experiment. Increasing the depth would be a transgression toward a ﬂux in
a corridor experiment, while smaller depths come closer to typical depths of doors.
And ﬁnally doing the experiment with another order of bottleneck widths - e.g.
starting with 40 cm and increasing - might lead to slightly different results.

Concerning model building, especially the combination of insights of the set
of experiments discussed in section 4 impressively demonstrates the richness of
phenomenons and the number of inﬂuences that pose a challenge for any model
builder. To mention just one example: the increased efﬁciency at short bottlenecks
demands to consider the body ellipse. If this is implemented, a routine has to be
modelled, that lets the agents in a simulation decide if they move toward a short or
a deep bottleneck and if they therefore will rotate their body ellipse or not.

Abstract

To investigate an eﬀect of social interaction on the bystanders’ intervention in
emergency situations we introduce a rescue model which includes the eﬀects of the
victim’s acquaintance with bystanders and those among bystanders. This model
reproduces the surprising experimental result that the helping rate tends to decrease
although the number of bystanders k increases. The model also shows that given
the coupling eﬀect among bystanders, for a certain range of small k the helping rate
increases according to k and that coupling eﬀect plays both positive and negative
roles in emergencies. Finally we ﬁnd a broad range of coupling strength to maximize
the helping rate.

1 Introduction

Recently the concepts and methods of statistical physics and nonlinear dynam-
ics are applied to investigate social, economic and psychological phenomena
[1,2,3]. Among the interesting subjects that have attracted physicists are the
opinion dynamics [4,5] including voting process [6,7] and social impact the-
ory [8,9,10,11,12,13]. Social impact theory stemmed from the bystander eﬀect
that was ﬁrst demonstrated in the laboratory by psychologists who studied the
eﬀect of social interaction among bystanders [14]. This eﬀect is a marvel phe-
nomenon where people are less likely to intervene in emergencies when others

are present than when they are alone. A well known example is Kitty Gen-
ovese case [15]. She was stabbed to death at one night in 1964 by a mentally
ill murderer for about 30 minutes while at least 38 witnesses were believed
to have failed to help the victim. On the other hand the refutation that the
popular account of the murder is mostly wrong was suggested on the web-
site [16]. Regardless to this controversy [17] many experimental results in the
laboratory and from ﬁeld studies show the bystander eﬀect obviously [14,18].

Although the social impact theory originated from the bystander eﬀect and
related models have been developed, there does not exist any model describing
quantitatively the bystander eﬀect itself. To construct the model mentioned
above we abstract a few important factors from the existing literatures [14,19].
The main dependent variables are the rates of reporting the smoke in the test
room, helping endangered victims and so on. When tested alone, subjects
behaved reasonably and the response rate was high. However the rate was sig-
niﬁcantly depressed when they were with other subjects. Subjects with others
were unsure of what had happened or thought other people would or could do
something. In another experiment subjects who were friends responded faster
than those who were strangers. The subjects who had met the victim were
signiﬁcantly faster to report victim’s distress than other subjects. And the
degree of arousal that bystanders perceive is a monotonic positive function of
the perceived severity and clarity of the emergency, and bystander’s emotional
involvement with the victim, which will be also considered by our rescue model
in an abstract way.

2 Rescue Model

A simple rescue model is introduced for investigating the statistical feature
of the eﬀects of the victim’s acquaintance with bystanders and those among
bystanders in emergency situations. We focus on the relations between agents
rather than agents themselves, so deﬁne a relation spin between two agents as
aij which is 1 if agents i and j have been successful in the intervention and 0
otherwise. aij can be interpreted as an element of adjacency matrix of helping
network. Each agent i has its intervention threshold ci over which that agent
can try to intervene in an emergency situation.

At each time step an accident happens which consists of the degree of accident
represented as a random number qv uniformly drawn from [0, 1], a randomly
selected victim v, the number of bystanders k conﬁned to [1, N
1], and a
set of randomly selected k bystanders Nv from a population. Then the update

where θ(xi) is a heaviside step function. Only one bystander i
Nv with the
largest value xi can intervene per accident. If we assume that the response
speed of bystander i is exponential in xi, the selection of the bystander with
the largest xi is justiﬁed. Additionally, once one bystander intervenes, the
pressures on the others will disappear. If xi ≥
0, the rescue succeeds and
then the victim v and that bystander i gain acquaintances if they have not
been related to each other. In case of xi < 0 the rescue fails and then their
acquaintance is cut if existed. α represents the degree of victim’s acquaintance
with bystander, so can be called an acquaintance strength. The third term of
θ function is related to the acquaintances among bystanders, for each relation

not exist any neutral relation here. β is used to tune the strength of coupling
so can be called a coupling strength. As an order parameter we adopt the

posed of homogeneous and non-adaptive agents. And for the most cases α is
also ﬁxed as 0.1. The main control parameter is the number of bystanders k.
Finally, the initial conditions are aij = 0 for all pairs.

2.1 Case with β = 0

At ﬁrst let us consider only the eﬀect of victim’s acquaintance with bystanders
and ignore those among bystanders. Generally an equation for the average
helping rate can be written as

The solution means that although the coupling strength is not considered
(β = 0), the helping rate depends on the number of bystanders k. As increasing
k the probability that the victim does not know any bystanders (contributes
to W0→1) decreases rapidly and the complementary probability (contributes to
W1→0) increases. This is why the helping rate decays. In this case α aﬀects not
the decaying behavior but the decaying speed only when α < c. If α becomes
larger than c, W1→0 = 0 so ak = 1 independent of k.

The numerical simulations are shown in Fig. 1 and reproduce the experimental
results that people who live in larger cities are less likely to help the strangers
[18]. Compared to Ref. [18] k corresponds to the size of city or town.

We introduced a simple rescue model to investigate the eﬀects of victim’s
acquaintance with bystanders (acquaintance strength α) and those among
bystanders (coupling strength β) for the bystanders’ intervention in emergency
situations. When β = 0, as the increasing number of bystanders k the helping
rate decreases, where the speed depends on α. For the case of β > 0 and k = 2,
there exists an optimal coupling strength β = c

rate. Coupling strength plays both positive and negative roles in emergencies.

eﬀect, the helping rate increases according to k. And then the helping rate
decays monotonically as for the case without a coupling eﬀect. Once k passes
k2 too many bystanders inhibit the helping. There exists a rather broad range
of β where almost all the trials to intervene in emergencies are successful.
In this case it is not necessary to ﬁne-tune the coupling strength to get the
highest helping rate.

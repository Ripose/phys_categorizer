Abstract

We employ the Bayesian framework to deﬁne a cointegration distance aimed to rep-
resent long term relationships between time series. For visualization and clustering
of these relationships we calculate a distance matrix and introduce a map based
on the Sorting Points Into Neighborhoods (SPIN) technique, which has been previ-
ously used to analyze large data sets from DNA arrays. We exemplify the technique
in three data sets: US interest rates, monthly inﬂation rates and gross domestic
product growth rates.

Correlations are a central topic in the study of the collective properties of
complex systems, being of particularly practical importance when systems of
economic interest are concerned [1]. The idea of cointegration [2,3] brings in
a property that could at ﬁrst be confused with correlation but that has up
to now been quite absent from the description of physical systems, be them
spin systems or economic systems studied from a physical perspective. A set
of non-stationary time series cointegrate if there exists a linear combination of
them that is mean reverting. Plainly speaking, two time series cointegrate if
in the long term they tend to move together. Unlike correlation, cointegration

is a relationship measure that is intrinsically long term, or macroeconomic, in
nature.

Bayesian methods provide a unifying approach to statistics [4]. They help to
establish, from clear ﬁrst principles, the methods, assumptions and approxi-
mations made in a particular statistical analysis. A major issue in the study
of cointegration is the detection of cointegrated sets, a problem that has been
extensively dealt with in the econometrics literature both from classical [5]
and Bayesian [6] perspectives.

Dealing with extensive volumes of data is a common trend in several areas
of science. The need to sort, cluster, organize, categorize, mine or visualize
large data sets brings a perspective that uniﬁes distant ﬁelds, if not at all in
aims, at least in methods. Cross fertilization may promptly provide candidate
solutions to problems, avoiding the need of rediscovery or worst, just plain
nondiscovery. Bioinformatics presents a good example, where the availability
of genome, protein and DNA array data has prompted the proposal by several
groups of new methods. From this repertoire we borrow a method, SPIN [7],
previously developed for automated discovery of cancer associated genes.

Our ﬁrst goal in this paper is to devise a cointegration distance between time
series of economic interest that is both physically meaningful and reasonably
simple to compute. Our second goal is, by employing the SPIN method, to em-
phasize the importance of visual organization and presentation of relationship
pictures (or maps) that emerge when complex systems are analysed.

A pair of time series x1 and x2 cointegrates [3] if there exists a linear combi-
nation

a1x1,t + a2x2,t + b = ǫt

such that the residues ǫ satisfy the following stationarity condition:

where hηti = 0, hη2
t i = σ2 and γ < 1. If γ = 1 the residues are non-stationary
and if γ > 1 the system is unstable. We also assume a budget constraint taking
the form

ǫt+1 = γǫt + ηt,

1 + a2
a2

2 = 1.

Since eq. 1 is linear, we can impose this constraint by assuming that a1 = sin(θ)
and a2 = cos(θ) without loss of generality. Note that the above system has
still more freedom arising from the following symmetry group:

2

(1)

(2)

(3)

xi → x′
i = αxi + yi,
b → b′ = αb − a1y1 − a2y2,
σ → σ′ = ασ,
γ → γ′ = γ,

which means that we can change the units in which quantities are measured
and add constants yi without interfering with the cointegration property. We,
therefore, can partially ﬁx the gauge so that xi → x′
i = xi − xi, such that
the empiric time series averages are zero. This forces a choice of b = 0. The
main ingredients in a Bayesian approach are three. First we need a model
as given by eqs. 1, 2 and 3. Then a noise model to build the likelihood and
ﬁnally the priors. The interesting consequence of a group of invariance as
the one described by eq. 4 is that it, together with the budget and stability
conditions, constrains the form of the priors to [4]:

p(γ) = Θ(γ)Θ(1 − γ),

where Θ(·) is the Heaviside step function, and

p(σ) ∝

1
σ2 .

With these ingredients we can calculate the posterior probability of γ given
the residues as:

p(γ | ǫ) ∝

dσ p(ǫ | γ, σ)p(σ)p(γ),

∞

σmin

Z

where σmin > 0 can be made arbitrarily small without changing the main
results to follow.

Equations 1 and 2 combined give the following likelihood function for the
residues:

tegrating pair, characterized by the maximum a-posteriori estimate ˆγ ≈ 0.5 (top).
Non-cointegrating pair characterized by ˆγ ≈ 1 (bottom). Right: SPINed cointegra-
tion heat map for the USIR dataset. Three main clusters, indicated by numbered
rectangles, emerge: Treasury interest rates with maturities equal 3 months (Group
1); interest rates with maturities ranging from 3 months to 1 year (Group 2); inter-
est rates with maturities larger than 1 year (Group 3). Subgroups A to F illustrate
the emergence of a complex pattern of relationships beyond the main 3 groups.

For large t, the distribution of residues, given the data, can be approximated

Finally, we deﬁne a family of cointegration α-distances as Dα(x1, x2) ≡ ˆγα.
These distances are symmetric and non-negative. We have observed that the
triangular inequality is satisﬁed with a probability that tends to one as the
data set size grows. However, this observation, that is directly connected to the
transitivity of the cointegration property, still lacks a formal proof. The value
of α controls the quality of visualizations generated and has been chosen to be
α = 1 (IFR,GDP) and α = 2 (USIR) in the datasets we have analyzed. In Fig.1

with T = 1000 and γ = 0.5 and γ = 1.0. Notice that it can be easily veriﬁed
by a Taylor expansion of the logarithm of the posterior density (eq. 9) around
its maximum that the error bar for the estimate ˆγ is proportional to T −1/2.

There are several possible aims behind unsupervised segmentation based on a
distance matrix D. Categorization from clustering algorithms has been used
for market segmentation [8,9,10]. For example, the Superparamagnetic Clus-
tering algorithm [11] has been particularly useful since the number of clusters
is not a priori known and the scale of resolution of the categories can be
tuned by a temperature like parameter. Sometimes the data might not have
a clear discrete class structure and here the SPIN algorithm provides a dif-
ference with its capability of helping identify low dimensional structures in a
high dimensional space. Without knowing in advance what type of segmen-
tation will emerge, the clustering and SPIN algorithms should be thought of
as complementary. The aim of SPINing a distance matrix is to obtain a per-
mutation such that points close in distance are brought, by the permutation
to places in the matrix that are also close. Since the space of permutations
is factorially large this can easily be seen to be a potentially hard problem.
The permutations are sequentially chosen, for example to minimize a cost
function that penalizes large distances and puts them far from the diagonal
or alternatively seek permutations that bring pairs with small distances near
to the diagonal. Unless the structure can be ordered in one dimension, these
requirements can lead to frustration. The class of cost functions proposed in
[7] is of the form F (P ) =Tr(P DP T W ), with P being a permutation of ma-
trix indices and W a weight matrix which deﬁnes the algorithm. For their
choices, namely, Side-to-Side (STS) deﬁned as W = XX T , with Xi > Xj if
i > j and Neighborhood deﬁned as Wij = exp(|i − j|σ), the minimization was

5

shown to be NP-complete. The way out is to be satisﬁed with non optimal
solutions that can be obtained in fast times (O(n2−3)) and that turn out to
be just as informative. The problem of sorting into categories is ill posed and
therefore there will not be something like ‘the answer’. The reduction to an op-
timization problem, using either STS or Neighborhood leads to a NP-complete
problem. It is fair to expect that any reasonable weight function will share
that characteristic. So we have found that it is adequate to play around with
the algorithms and apply them for diﬀerent subsets, try optimizing the whole
matrix, then choose a relevant cointegrating subset,optimize the subset, go up
optimize the whole set, intercalate diﬀerent algorithms. The result will tend
to be better as measured by the cost function. This heuristics helps escape
from local minima, of course it does not cure the fundamental problem that
there might be frustration in a general sorting problem. This is not really a
problem, good albeit not optimal solutions are just as informative as a perfect
solution would be for all practical purposes.

We exemplify the method by calculating cointegration maps for three data
sets: (USIR) weekly US interest rates for 34 instruments from January 8, 1982
to August 29, 1997 (T = 817 weeks) [12]; (IFR) monthly inﬂation rates for
179 countries from August, 1993 to December 2004 (T = 137 months) [13];
(GDP) yearly gross domestic product growth rates for 71 countries from 1980
to 2004 (T = 25 years) [14].

Measurement in soft sciences is itself a challenging activity [15]. Socio-economic
systems are self-aware, there are severe limits to the accuracy of statistical data
that can be gathered and even the deﬁnition of several macroeconomic quan-
tities is still debatable [16,17]. An exception to these data quality constraints
are the organized ﬁnancial markets like those of interest rate instruments in
dataset USIR.

Figure 1 (right) shows the SPINed cointegration map for USIR. Grey levels
(or pseudocolors in the electronic version of this document) are assigned ac-
cording to distances calculated. Considering the reliability of the estimates
(σγ ≈ 0.035 for USIR), the map produced allows a direct visualization of pair-
wise relationships through the whole set of time series without imposing any
ad hoc classiﬁcation criteria. The SPINed cointegration map for the dataset
USIR yields interest rates ordered onto three main groups according to their
maturities (until 3 months, from 3 months to one year and more than one
year). A similar classiﬁcation is obtained when linear correlations are used as
the relationship measure [9].

Figure 2 (left) shows the SPINed cointegration map for monthly inﬂation data
(IFR). Even though the estimates are less reliable in this case (σγ ≈ 0.085) it is
possible to identify groups by inspecting their mutual relationships represented
by the color map. Group 1 consists of countries that experienced periods of

6

political and economic unrest (e.g. Cambodia, Congo and Ethiopia). Group 2
is mainly composed by advanced economies (e.g. European Union countries,
USA and Japan) and countries that are very closely related to them (e.g.
Martinique, Singapore and Bahamas). Group 3 consists of underdeveloped
(e.g. Haiti, Niger and Rwanda), developing (e.g. Brazil, Iran and Mexico)
and former soviet block (e.g. Russia, Poland, Bulgaria) economies. Group 4
contains Australia, New Zealand and small island countries (e.g. Kiribati and
Belize). Curiously, Group 4 interacts weakly with most of the countries in
Group 2.

The cointegration map for GDP data (Fig. 2) must be dealt with care as
this data set is statistically less reliable than the previous two sets (σγ ≈
0.2). To minimize interpretation problems due to GDP measurement issues
we have selected from the IMF database 71 countries that have had mostly
open market economies in the period observed (1980-2004). As a criterion
to classify diﬀerent groups, we have looked at general interaction patterns
compatible with the limited reliability of the estimates. The SPINned matrix
shows that there are four distinguishable classes, but that their boundaries
are not sharp. This exempliﬁes the diﬀerence between SPIN and clustering.
In the latter sharp boundaries are imposed, even when there are none. We,
therefore, have deﬁned Group 1 as being composed by countries that interact
with countries in Group 2. Group 2 consists of countries that interact with
Group 4 and less strongly with Group 3. Group 3 is characterized by countries
that do not interact with Group 1, interact strongly with Group 4 and less
strongly with Group 2. Finally, Group 4 interacts with Groups 2 and 3 but not
with Group 1. This procedure results in large oil exporters clustered in Group
3, G7 countries clustered in Groups 2 and 4 and a set of countries with still
unidentiﬁed relationship (e.g. Bangladesh, Pakistan and Tanzania) clustered
in Group 1.

In this paper we have developed a simple measure for long term pairwise
relationships in sets of time series by introducing a Bayesian estimate for
a cointegration distance. For visualization of the relationships, with a mini-
mum introduction of ad hoc structures, we have borrowed from the repertoire
of Bioinformatics the SPIN ordering technique to produce cointegration heat
maps. We have exempliﬁed the technique in three sets of time series of ﬁnan-
cial and economic interest and have been capable of visualizing economically
sensible low-dimensional structures emerging from the procedure.

Socio-economic systems are a class of complex systems with both interactions
and dynamics unreliably known at best. We, therefore, regard designing tools
for measuring and visualizing collective properties beyond linear correlations
as an essential part of a research program that may improve our quantitative
understanding of such systems.

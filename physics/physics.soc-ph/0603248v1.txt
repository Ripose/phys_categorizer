The paper proposes a new model of spin dynamics which can be treated as a model of
sociological coupling between individuals. Our approach takes into account two diﬀerent
human features: gregariousness and individuality. We will show how they aﬀect a psycho-
logical distance between individuals and how the distance changes the opinion formation
in a social group. Apart from its sociological aplications the model displays the variety
of other interesting phenomena like self-organizing ferromagnetic state or a second order
phase transition and can be studied from diﬀerent points of view, e.g. as a model of
ferromagnetic ﬂuid, complex evolving network or multiplicative random process.

Keywords: Ising model; Social impact; Ferromagnetic ﬂuids; Multiplicative random pro-
cesses.

1. Introduction

Interdisciplinary research has been drawing much attention in the last decades. Mod-
els and methods developed in theoretical physics proved to be fruitful in studying
complex systems 1,2, composed of relatively simple mutually interacting elements
and coming from domains as diverge as neural networks 3, disease spreading 4, pop-
ulation dynamics 5, etc. But the range of the investigations goes also beyond the
natural sciences and includes problems from sociology or economy, like pedestrian
motion and traﬃc 6, migrations 7,8 or ﬁnancial crashes 9. Another important sub-
ject of this kind is the process of opinion formation in social groups. One way of
its quantitative description consists in a macroscopic approach based on the master
equation or the Boltzmann-like equations for global variables 7,10,11. Alternatively,
by making some sociologically motivated assumptions on the mechanisms of inter-
actions between individuals ”microscopic” models are constructed and investigated
numerically or analytically by means of methods known from statistical physics
12,13. One concludes that the variety of the emerging physical collective phenomena
has much in common with the complex social processes.

In particular, Nowak, Szamrej and Latane created a simple model based upon
the successful theory of social impact in human societes ﬁrst introduced by La-

tane in 1981 14. In the simplest form their model characterizes the strength of the
psychological coupling between the individuals by two qualities: persuasiveness and
support. The former describes the ability of one individual to persuade the other
one to change his/her opinion. The later describes the ability of one individual to
support the other one in his/her opinion. Diﬀerent variants of the model were ex-
plored numerically 15,16,17, and many of the observations were than explained in
the framework of a mean ﬁeld approach 18,19,20 and the Landau theory 21.

Here we would like to present a rather diﬀerent approach to describe psycho-
logical coupling. Instead of persuasiveness and support we will study the eﬀect of
gregariousness and individuality. We will show how the two features may aﬀect
psychological distance between individuals and how the distance changes opinion
formation in the society. Finally, we will show that our model could be mapped to
ferromagnetic ﬂuid not in Euclidean but in a social space.

2. The model

Our system consists of N individuals (members of a social group); we assume that
each of them can share one of two opposite opinions on a certain subject, denoted
as σi = ±1, i = 1, 2, ...N . The Hamiltonian of the model reads:

(1)

(2)

H = −

Ji,j(t)σiσj .

Xi<j

Individuals can inﬂuence each other with the strength Ji,j(t) which can be un-
derstood as an inverse of their distance in a social space. The above means that a
stronger impact corresponds to a shorter distance. We assume that social distances
are changing in time and we put on the following dynamics of the strength Ji,j (t):

Ji,j(t + 1) = Ji,j(t)(1 + η − ασiσj ).

The parameter η > 0 is responsible for continous growth of the social strength
and can be identiﬁed as gregariousness of i-th individual which leads to tightening
of ties with other people. In other words, people from their nature seek the company
of others. The parameter α > 0 describes another natural tendency of people which
is a need to be diﬀerent than a surrounding crowd, i.e. it reﬂects the inclination of
an individual to demonstrate his/her individuality.

For completeness of the model we assume as an initial condition any positive val-
ues of Ji,j (t = 0). The condition assures that during the system evolution couplings
are always positive in the most interesting range of parameters η and α.

Now, let us concentrate on the phase diagram for the presented model (ﬁg. 1). It
is divided into four diﬀerent regions by three curves. The curve 1 is the most obvious
one. For every set of parameters above this curve, i.e. for η > α, coupling strengthes
will increase to inﬁnity in exponential way. Parameters η < α − 1, limited by the
curve 3, also make the system unstable, but now coupling strengthes can become
negative. It means that in every step J will change its sign and |J| will diverge to
inﬁnity. The stable region lies between two curves 1 and 3.

Detailed explanation in the text.

To explain the curve 2 let us concentrate on a single coupling and investigate
the following process: J(t) → J(t + 1) → J(t + 2) = J(t). As one can see from eq.
2, in every step J grows or decreases by some well deﬁned value. The above process
is the simplest one in which J stays at some ﬁxed level, i.e. it grows and then it
decreases to the same value. Let us assume that J(t + 1) > J(t) (the opposite case
is analogous). It means that J(t + 1) = J(t)(1 + η + α). Then, in next step J should
decrease ,i.e. J(t + 2) = J(t + 1)(1 + η − α). From above one can obtain the following
condition:

ηc =

1 + α2 − 1.

p

It is easy to see that a corresponding critical condition for a generalized process
J(t) → J(t + 1) → J(t + 2) → ... → J(t + 2n) = J(t) is equivalent to the condition
(3).

If we set η below the critical value ηc then the above process will result in
decreasing J to zero. Then it is obvious that two spins for which this coupling J
is investigated become disconnected and independent, what leads to paramagentic
state.

To complete discussion of the phase diagram one has to note that it is useful to

assure α ≪ 1. If one rewrites the eq. (2) in the following form:

Ji,j(t + 1) − Ji,j(t)
αJi,j(t)

=

∆Ji,j (t)
Ji,j(t)α∆t

η
α

=

− σiσj ,

then one can see that α plays the role of time scale. It means that for large α the
succesive values of J are very distant (J changes very fast) and spin dynamics can
not follow to compensate changes of J. It manifests itself in long time observed
paramagnetic states interrupted by long time observed ferromagnetic states.

In summary, the interesting from the sociological point of view range of param-

eters is ηcritical < η < α ≪ 1.

The dynamics of changes of individual’s opinion is given by a simple Monte
Carlo procedure based on the Metropolis algorithm. A temperature T given in
the algorithm may be interpreted as a ”social temperature” describing degree of
randomness in the behavior of individuals, but also their average volatility. The
procedure consists of two steps. In the ﬁrst step we update states of N randomly
chosen individuals. In the second step we update coupling strengths for all nodes
according to eq. (2).

As we will show for a wide range of parameters η and α, regardless of choosing
a temperature the system tends to be in a ferromagnetic regime. It means that
despite a tendency to manifest individuality most of individuals interact with the
other people who share the same opinion.

3. Results

A typical dependence of magnetization per spin |m| on system parameters η/α is
shown at ﬁg. 2. Considering η as an order parameter, continous (second order) phase
transition occurs for ηc given by eq. (3). Open points presented at ﬁg. 1 obtained
from simulations conﬁrm that the above derivation is correct.

One can see from the ﬁg. 4 that the absolute value of the mean magnetization
is an (increasing) function of η/α but it is completely independent on the system
temperature T . The fact can be understood as follows. According to eq. (4) we can
write the following equation for the mean value for the logarithm of Ji,j

can write that

− g(hJi,j i/T ).

When the system is close to equilibrium the left hand side of the last equation in
average equals to zero and the equation simpliﬁes to the following relation

hJi,j i/T = g

−1(η/α).

In this sense the average value of the coupling constant is always proportional to
the temperature and a function of a ratio η/α.

Since m is a function of the ratio hJi,j i/T thus it only depends on the ratio η/α
and does not depend on the system temperature. The numerical conﬁrmation of the
statement is presented at ﬁg. 3.

same dependence in linear scale. Slopes of two ﬁtted linear functions represent a proportionality
factor given by function g−1(η/α) from eq. (7).

To illustrate the eﬀect one can perform the following procedure. First, set values
of the parameters η and α, and also temperature T1 of the system. (These values re-
sult in a given spin magnetization depicted in ﬁg. 4 by m∗, and they also correspond
to a certain distribution of couplings between spins P (J).) Now we would like to
reconstruct the whole magnetization curve passing through the point (T1, m∗). Un-
fortunately, as we have already shown any change of T modiﬁes coupling strengthes,
which in consequence modify the shape of the magnetization curve. Reconstruction
of m(T ) will be possible if we freeze P (J), i.e. we make each Ji,j constant.

Once we have determined m(T ), we restore dependence of J on T and change
temperature to new value T2 > TC1. A new pair (T2, m∗) determines a new critical
temperature TC2. The curve at the ﬁg. 4a adjusts to new conditions and transforms

to the shape shown at the ﬁg. 4b (obtained by the same method as before). It
means that regardless of a choice of the system temperature we are always below
the critical temperature, i.e. in the ferromagnetic state.

The sociological conclusion could be as follows: regardless of a ”social temper-
ature” people always try to correlate their opinions with others (create groups of
interest). This tendency to share the same opinion with other people, regardless of
some external forces, make us, people, so resistant to trials of despots to make the
people unorganized and disoriented. Of course the parameter η/α characterizes our
own (not social) point of view which gives us some independency respecting other
people opinion.

From the point of view of complex networks domain 22,23 it is interesting to
consider the model as a weighted network, where nodes correspond to individuals
and links have assigned weights equal to coupling strength. One of nontrivial obser-
vations is a distribution of coupling strengthes P (J) which is presented at ﬁg. 5. As
one can see for large temperature T the distribution has a form of power law with
the exponent γ ≈ 0.85.

It seems that there should be a strong relation between the observed power-law
distributions and distributions obtained due to a more general class of multiplicative
random processes 24,25. If fact, one can easily ﬁnd some similarity of eq. (2) to eq.
(1) in 24. The diﬀerences occur when one takes into account the temperature and its
inﬂuence on distributions at ﬁg. (5). We suspect that the model studied by us settles
somewhere between two multiplicative random processes studied in 24 and 25. This
hypothesis is still under investigation and the results will be published elsewhere.

Now let us draw attention to similarity of the presented model to magnetic
ﬂuids which are widely studied for the last thirty years 26. Magnetic ﬂuids are
described by interacting molecules with both translational and spin degrees of free-
dom. They interact due to weak long-ranged exchange interactions in addition to
spin-independent isotropic attractive forces. The most simple physical parameter

where φex(~r) describes exchange integral, φattr(~r) some attractive-type integral
and ~r is Euclidean distance between molecules. One can easily see a correspondence
between the above parameter and the main parameter of our model η/α. In that
sense η and α have respectively attractive and spin-dependent properties, and our
distance in social space reﬂects Euclidean distance ~r.

4. Conclusions

In this paper we propose a new model of spin dynamics which could be treated
as a model of sociological coupling between individuals. Apart from its sociological
aplications the model displays the variety of other interesting phenomena like self-
organizing ferromagnetic state or a second order phase transition and can be studied
from diﬀerent points of view, for example as a model of ferromagnetic ﬂuid, complex
evolving network or multiplicative random process.

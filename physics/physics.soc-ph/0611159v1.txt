Phase transition in the globalization of trade

M. ´Angeles Serrano

Globalization processes interweave economic structures at a worldwide scale, trade play-

ing a central role as one of the elemental channels of interaction among countries. Despite

the signiﬁcance of such phenomena, measuring economic globalization still remains an

open problem. More quantitative treatments could improve the understanding of glob-

alization at the same time that help a formal basis for comparative economic history. In

this letter, we investigate the time evolution of the statistical properties of bilateral trade

imbalances between countries in the trade system. We measure their cumulative proba-

bility distribution at different moments in time to discover a sudden transition circa 1960

from a regime where the distribution was always represented by a steady characteristic

function to a new state where the distribution dilates as time goes on. This suggests that

the rule that was governing the statistical behavior of bilateral trade imbalances until the

60’s abruptly changed to a new form persistent in the last decades. In the new regime, the

ﬁgures for the different years collapse into a universal master curve when rescaled by the

corresponding global gross domestic product value. This coupling points to an increased

interdependence of world economies and its onset corresponds in time with the starting of

the last globalization wave.

At this point, the beginning of the third millennium in the Gregorian calendar, it seems

customarily assumed that several epochs of globalization have occurred to shape the world as

1

we perceive it today. In these periods, a complex series of changes closely intertwined develop

into an increasing interdependence and interaction between people and human organizations in

disparate locations of the world. These changes, when structural, are in a great part of economic

nature, markets becoming natural mediators of globalization forces 1.

In terms of trade 2, there is still controversy whether the last globalization waves, the ﬁrst

roughly identiﬁed from 1870 till the beginning of World War I and the second from 1960 to

the present, are more different than similar 3 –there is no a complete agreement either whether a

third middle wave has occurred 4. The two waves correspond to processes of decolonization and

falls of technical barriers with the corresponding downloads of costs and time expenditures.

The ﬁrst wave was triggered by the Industrial Revolution, with steam power spoiling the ex-

panding of railroad networks and oceanic routes and the telegraph connecting the two sides of

the Atlantic. The second came intimately related to the Information Technologies Revolution,

communications costs dramatically dropping at the same time that information management

capabilities explode. In gross terms, the ﬁrst globalization burst had to do with lower costs in

transportation of materials and goods, while the second deals with exchange of information and

ideas. Two different natures of changes that may well produce different impacts.

This discussion brings directly to the problem of how to measure globalization. Quantitative

approaches could enlighten but have been timid to this moment, most works adopting analyti-

cal methodologies. New quantitative ways of studying globalization processes are required to

exploit the wealth of information in historical data 5,6. One simple step forward consists in com-

plementing the study of aggregated or global values with the statistical analysis of how they are

distributed, from where we can obtain not only more detailed but also new information. For

instance, a prominent ﬁgure when measuring globalization of trade plots the evolution in time

of total international trade as a percentage of the global product, computed as the sum of all

national gross domestic products (GDPs). As it has been reported by several authors 3,4,7, an

U-shape pattern emerges, with rise of trade in the two eras of globalization and a major rever-

sal in between, and has been claimed as a common trait which recurs in many other empirical

2

analysis, such as in the plot of global capital ﬂows to GDP ratios or in the correlation between

savings and investment 3,8.

Still, further crucial information can be obtained from trade data if, moreover, one draws

the evolution in time of the distribution of bilateral trade ﬂows. Here we show that until 1960,

all the distributions overlap into a characteristic function, which afterwards evolves widening as

time goes by. Most interestingly, the different trade imbalances distributions for all years since

1960 can be rescaled into a single master curve just by taking into account the evolution in

time of the global GDP, which marks a characteristic scale with respect to which the system is

self-similar. The breaking of the original folding at the point when a new single-curve collapse

starts suggests that the rule that has been governing the statistical behavior of bilateral trade

imbalances until the 60’s has changed to a new scaling law in the last decades, and that this

has happened in a sudden transition of the world trade system just at the beginning of the last

globalization wave.

We used historical national import/export data from two different databases, DBI 9,10 (1870-

1992) and DBII 11,12 (1948-2000). World GDP historical values are more difﬁcult to obtain.

Despite its role as a major instrument of economic policy in virtually all countries in the world,

it is indeed a twentieth century concept as the rest of the national income accounts and GDP

data were not collected or even deﬁned before the 1930s. In our graphs, GDP data come from a

third source 13,14. The bilateral trade ﬂux F between two countries is computed as the net money

ﬂow from one to the other due to trade exchanges. In Fig. 1, the time evolution of the global

GDP is compared to that of the average bilateral trade ﬂow. Both evolutions seem decoupled

until the 60’s. From 1870 to that date, and without taking into account war periods, the average

imbalance remains ﬂuctuating around a constant level, in contrast to the estimation for the

global GDP, which appreciably grows. Afterwards, they couple and follow similar growing

patterns. This seems indicative of a change of behavior or transition. In Fig. 2, we present the

complementary cumulative probability distribution of net trade ﬂows between pairs of countries

for several different years since 1870. The curves are measuring the probability that a trade

3

imbalance between two countries in the trade system is bigger than a certain amount, and the

cumulative evaluation offers the advantage of ﬁltering out the statistical noise due to the ﬁnite

sizes of the samples without loosing information about the distribution. The ﬁrst to observe

is that, in good approximation, all the curves overlap between the years 1870 and 1960, see

Fig. 2(a), moment in which the folding is broken and the distributions evolve widening year

after year, see Fig. 2(c). We now rescale the curve for each year by taking into account the global

GDP value in that period. For each distribution, we apply the transformation F

F/GDP

−→

which divides the ﬂuxes in the horizontal F axis by the corresponding global GDP value. The

results are shown in Fig. 2(b) and (d). In Fig. 2(b), we just corroborate that the collapse does not

work for the years between 1870 to 1960, the transformation indeed breaks the original folding.

On the contrary, in Fig. 2(d) all the distributions for different years since 1960 and until 2000

and for the two different databases under consideration show an excellent collapse into a single

master curve. Imports and exports on their own are seen to present the same behavior, due to

the high correlation between the levels of imports and exports in every single trade channel.

We see that the master curve, and indeed every distribution, is lognormal –they can be

thought of as the multiplicative product of many small independent factors–, again an ubiqui-

tous shape in economics. The collapse that it represents implies that the system is self-similar

with respect to the characteristic scale given by the GDP. That means that the widening of the

distributions in time is just a dilatation driven by the increase in total GDP and the same curve

is found once the GDP growth is discounted. Until new structural changes impact the world

trade system, we can assume that this behavior will be preserved through time so that, by taking

into account global GDP projection values, we can predict the statistical distribution of bilateral

trade imbalances that would correspond to future periods.

To understand better how GDP and trade imbalances are related, the empirically successful

gravity model of international trade can be revisited 15. In its basic form, it predicts bilateral

trade ﬂows based on a functional form that is reminiscent of the law of gravity in physics, and

involves the distance between pairs of countries and their economic masses, estimated in ﬁrst

4

instance as their GDP. Thus, bilateral trade imbalances seem to be empirically dictated in part

by the GDP values of the countries concerned. On the other hand, the aggregated value of all

bilateral trade ﬂows for a certain country affects in its turn GDP levels. The GDP of a country

is deﬁned as the market value of all ﬁnal goods and services produced within its borders in a

given period of time. In the expenditure-based approach, it is decomposed in several terms as

GDP (t) = C(t) + I(t) + G(t) + F (t), where C(t) stands for private consumption, I(t) for

business investments in capital, G(t) for government spending, and F (t) stands for net trade

balance. So, internal contributions are corrected by the trade interactions with other countries.

The sudden transition in the 60’s that ties from that moment on the evolution of the statistical

distribution of net trade ﬂows to that of the global GDP seems to suggest that the internal com-

ponents of the economies (private, business and government spending) become more dependent

on trade exchanges with other countries. All this points to the presence of a complex continu-

ous feedback mechanism between GDP and international trade that after the 60’s becomes more

entangled in the sense of affecting also purely internal factors. So, the integration of markets

in the last decades does not seem to come in a smooth gradual transformation but rather in a

fault transition. Whether this is indicative of the birth of a truly global market where all the

economies are effectively interwoven beyond trade needs more prove. New validations about

the reach of the phase transition should be performed as well. One example of technical ques-

tion that immediately arises is whether the empirical success of gravity models for explaining

bilateral trade as a function of GDP after the 1960 is maintained when studying historical data

before this date.

In a way that is complementary to more traditional approaches in economics, we measure

a sudden transition in the statistical behavior of trade imbalances which corresponds in time

with the starting of the last globalization wave. From a regime where the distribution of trade

imbalances was steady and independent of the evolution of GDP, a new state is reached where

the global GDP marks the characteristic scale and the distribution dilates as GDP grows in

time. In the new regime, the distributions for the different years collapse into a single universal

5

master curve when rescaled by the corresponding global GDP value. Although more work

should be done in order to clarify the relation between these empirical facts and the effects of

the last wave of globalization in trade, the empirical ﬁndings in this paper point to an abrupt

transformation that has qualitatively and quantitatively increased the interdependence of world

economies through trade. The segregation of factors in purely internal components, just related

to individual economies, versus trade, implying interactions with other countries, seems not be

neat any more and the mere aggregation of bilateral trade exchanges is not enough to explain

the emergent behavior of the global trade system, that, on the other hand, we can predict at the

statistical level. While we do not see any other radical revolutions impacting the trade system,

and maybe this is not so difﬁcult, the self-similar character of the distribution of bilateral trade

imbalances allows us to anticipate its form for the forthcoming years.

Figure 1: Historical evolution of global GDP values and average trade imbalances.. From

1870 to 2000, the average value of the bilateral trade imbalances between countries in the world

trade system for the two data bases that we are considering is compared to the evolution in the

same period of the global gross domestic product (GDP). The results are shown on a log-linear

scale for ease of comparison. The unit of measure for the average imbalance is millions of

current year US dollars. GDP is also given in millions of current year US dollars, but it is

rescaled to the level of bilateral trade imbalances. The war periods, 1914-1919 and 1939-1947,

are avoided due to lack of reported information in the data bases.

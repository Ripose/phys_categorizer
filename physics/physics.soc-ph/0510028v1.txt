ABSTRACT

to be θf ∼ 0.5.

Persistence is studied in a ﬁnancial context by mapping the time evolution of the values of

the shares quoted on the London Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 index (FTSE 100)

onto Ising spins. By following the time dependence of the spins, we ﬁnd evidence for power

law decay of the proportion of shares that remain either above or below their ‘starting’

values. As a result, we estimate a persistence exponent for the underlying ﬁnancial market

In its most general form, persistence is concerned with the fraction of space which persists

in its initial state up to some later time. The problem has been extensively studied in

recent years for pure spin systems at both zero [1-4] and non-zero [5] temperatures.

For example, in the non-equilibrium dynamics of spin systems at zero-temperature, the

system is prepared in a random state at t = 0 and the fraction of spins, P (t), that

persist in the same state as at t = 0 up to some later time t is studied. For the pure

ferromagnetic two-dimensional Ising model the persistence probability has been found to

decay algebraically [1-4]

P (t) ∼ t

−θ,

(1)

where θ ∼ 0.22 is the non-trivial persistence exponent [1-3].

The value of θ depends on both the spin [6] and spatial [3] dimensionalities; see Ray [7]

for a recent review.

At non-zero temperatures [5], consideration of the global order parameter leads to a value

of θ ∼ 0.5 for the two-dimensional Ising model.

Very recently, disordered systems [8-10] have also been studied and have been found to

exhibit diﬀerent persistence behaviour to that of pure systems.

Persistence has also been studied in a wide range of experimental systems and the value

of θ ranges from 0.19 to 1.02 [11-13]. Much of the recent theoretical eﬀort has gone into

obtaining the numerical value of θ for diﬀerent models.

In this work we present the ﬁrst estimate for a persistence exponent extracted from ﬁnancial

A ﬁnancial market is an example of a complex many-body system exhibiting many of the

characteristics found in model systems studied in statistical physics. For example, there is

an element of both co-operation and ‘frustration’ [14] in the movement of share values. In

this work we make no assumptions about any underlying model systems. Rather, we treat

the historical share values of the companies over time as the outcomes of some ‘experiment’

data.

The ﬁnancial market we study is the set of companies quoted on the London Financial

Times Stock Exchange 100 (FTSE 100) share index.

The data used in this study was obtained from Datastream [15], a database of ﬁnancial

information, and refers to the end of day prices over the randomly chosen ten year period

from 24 February 1995 to 1 February 2005. The data were mapped onto Ising spins using

the procedure outlined below.

The ‘base’ share price, (P b

i (t = 0), i = 1 . . . , 100), of each of the companies appearing in

FTSE 100 at the end of trading on 24 February 1995 was noted to 2 decimal places. All

prices for the shares used in this work were taken to be the closing values at the end of

trading. At t = 1 (the end of trading on the next day) the share price of each company,

Pi(t = 1), was compared with the corresponding base price.

We allocate a value Si(t = 0) = +1 if Pi(t = 1) ≥ P b

i (t = 0) and a value of Si(t = 0) = −1

if Pi(t = 1) < P b

i (t = 0).

The values {Si(t = 0), i = 1, . . . 100} form the initial conﬁguration for our ‘spin’ system.

All of the subsequent 10 years worth of data was converted into possible values of Ising

spins, Si(t), using the share values at t = 0 as the base. As a result, we are able to use

Si(t) to track the value of the underlying share relative to its base price. It is worth noting

that companies have to satisfy certain qualiﬁcation criteria before they are included in

the FTSE 100 [16]. As a result, in practice, a given company’s presence in the FTSE 100

can ﬂuctuate from year to year. In our analysis we restricted ourselves to the core set of

companies remaining in the FTSE 100 throughout the time period under consideration.

Hence, the ﬁrst time Si(t) 6= Si(t = 0) corresponds to the underlying share value either

going above (Si(t) = +1) or below (Si(t) = −1) the base price also for the ﬁrst time. This

gives us a direct analogy with the persistence problem that has been extensively studied

in spin systems.

At each time step, we count the number of spins that still persist in their initial (t = 0)

state by evaluating [17]

ni(t) = (Si(t)Si(0) + 1)/2.

(2)

Initially, ni(0) = 1 for all i. It changes to zero when a spin ﬂips (that is, the underlying

share price goes above/below the base price) for the ﬁrst time. Note that once ni(t) = 0,

it remains so for all subsequent calculations.

The total number, n(t), of spins which have never ﬂipped until time t is then given by

We now discuss our results. In this initial study, three diﬀerent time periods were consid-

reasons outlined earlier).

ered:

a) 24 February 1995 to 1 February 2005

b) 9 January 1996 to 28 December 2000

c) 3 January 2000 to 3 January 2005

outlined above.

For each time period, the initial and subsequent spin conﬁgurations were generated as

Figures 1 to 3 show log-log plots of the density of non-ﬂipping spins against time for each

of the three time periods. Although, as expected, there is noise in the data, we see that

in all three cases we have clear evidence of an initial power-law decay. It’s also clear from

the plots that nearly all of the spins have ﬂipped after ln t ≈ 4. This corresponds to

approximately 30 − 50 days of trading on the markets. However, there are a handful of

spins which do not ﬂip over the entire time period under consideration. Furthermore, there

appears to be a cross-over to a faster power-law decay for longer times. This cross-over is

5

only really evident in Figure 1 as there is too much noise in the other 2 sets of data. The

dashed line in Figure has a slope of −0.39. The faster decay is indicated by the dotted line

which has a slope of −1.4. The initial power law decays are indicated by the straight lines

in Figures 2 and 3. From the linear ﬁts, we can extract a value of θf ranging from 0.43

to 0.55. As a consequence, we estimate the persistence exponent for the ﬁnancial data to

be ∼ 0.5. We believe this to be the ﬁrst estimate of a persistence exponent from ﬁnancial

data.

Our value for θf is not inconsistent with the value obtained from computer simulations

of the 2D Ising model at a non-zero temperature [5]. This is an intriguing result as we

have made no assumptions whatsover about the underlying model which gives rise to the

ﬁnancial data. Of course, in our analysis, the value of each Si(t) summarises the overall

performance of the shares of the underlying company relative to the base value.

To conclude, we have used a novel mapping to map the share values quoted on the London

Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 share index onto Ising spins. As a result, we extracted

a value of ∼ 0.5 for the persistence exponent. This should be regarded as an initial estimate

and further work is required to conﬁrm the value. It should be noted that, out of necessity,

we worked with end of day closing prices. Ideally, it would be better to use tick-data. It’s

remarkable that our value is not inconsistent with the value of the persistence exponent

obtained for the 2D-Ising model at non-zero temperature. This observation justiﬁes further

investigation.

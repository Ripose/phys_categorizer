Motivated by the empirical analysis of the air transportation system, we deﬁne a network model
that includes geographical attributes along with topological and weight (traﬃc) properties. The
introduction of geographical attributes is made by constraining the network in real space. Inter-
estingly, the inclusion of geometrical features induces non-trivial correlations between the weights,
the connectivity pattern and the actual spatial distances of vertices. The model also recovers the
emergence of anomalous ﬂuctuations in the betweenness-degree correlation function as ﬁrst observed
by Guimer`a and Amaral [Eur. Phys. J. B 38, 381 (2004)]. The presented results suggest that the
interplay between weight dynamics and spatial constraints is a key ingredient in order to understand
the formation of real-world weighted networks.

INTRODUCTION

The empirical evidence coming from studies on sys-
tems belonging to areas as diverse as social sciences, bi-
ology and computer science have shown that the usual
paradigm of random graphs is often not well suited to
describe real world networks [1, 2, 3, 4]. In particular, in
a wide range of networks the occurrence of vertices with
a very large degree (number of links to other vertices) is
very likely. The presence of these “hubs” often goes along
with very large degree ﬂuctuations. The large topological
heterogeneity associated to these features is statistically
expressed by the presence of heavy-tailed degree distri-
butions with diverging variance that have a very strong
impact on the networks’ physical properties such as re-
silience and vulnerability, or the propagation of pathogen
agents [5, 6, 7, 8].

The purely topological deﬁnition of networks, however,
misses important attributes which are frequently encoun-
tered in real-world networks. In the ﬁrst instance, net-
works are far from boolean structure and are better rep-
resented as weighted graphs with the intensity of links
that may vary over many orders of magnitude. Indeed,
in many graphs ranging from food-webs to metabolic net-
works, large variations of the link intensities are empir-
ically observed [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. Notably, the
statistical properties of weights indicate non-trivial cor-
relations and association with topological quantities [14].
Finally, the correlation between weights on diﬀerent links
is at the origin of the existence of pathways which are
particularly important in metabolic networks for exam-
ple [15]. Another important element of many real net-

works is their embedding in the real space. For instance,
most people have their friends and relatives in their
neighborhood, transportation networks depend on dis-
tance, and many communication networks devices have
short radio range [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. A particularly
important example of such a “spatial” network is the In-
ternet which is a set or routers linked by physical cables
with diﬀerent lengths and latency times [4, 21]. An anal-
ogous situation is faced in the air transportation network
with routes covering very diﬀerent distances. The length
of the link is a very important quantity usually associated
with an intrinsic cost in the establishment of the connec-

the connections starting from a given node will go to the
closest neighbors in the embedding space. Long-range
links, on the other hand, correspond usually to connec-
tions towards already well-connected nodes (hubs). This
seems natural in the case of the air transportation net-
work for instance: short connections go to small airports
while long distance ﬂights are directed preferentially to-
wards large airports (i.e. well connected nodes).
It is
therefore natural to ﬁnd that spatial constraints can have
important consequences on the topology of the resulting
network [22, 23].

Recently, the raising interest on the dynamics and
function of complex networks has fostered studies go-
ing beyond the simple topological structure. In partic-
ular, models of complex networks in which the diversity
of weights is taken into account have been formulated
having in mind growing networks where the dynamics is
driven by the intensity of the weights along with a re-
inforcement mechanism [24, 25, 26, 27]. Other models
have focused on more geometrical mechanisms or some-
how diﬀerent dynamical rules [28, 29, 30, 31]. These
models, however, are not able to reproduce all of the fea-
tures observed in real world networks. For instance, the
anomalous centrality ﬂuctuations observed in Ref. [23] do
not ﬁnd a rationalization in models based only on topol-

ogy and weight properties. On the other hand, some of
these interesting and non-trivial features can result from
the introduction of spatial attributes in the models’ con-
struction [23].
In this article, we discuss the interplay
of the three aforementioned ingredients (heterogeneous
topology, weights and spatial constraints) in a model
of growing network combining these ingredients at once.
The proposed model is obtained as the embedding of the
weighted growing network introduced in [24] in a two-
dimensional geometrical space. Spatial constraints are
translated into a preference for short links, and combined
with the coupling between the evolution of the network
and the dynamical rearrangement of the weights. This
mechanism naturally leads to the appearance of many
features observed in real-world networks, in particular
the non-linear correlations between weights and topology,
and the large ﬂuctuations of the betweenness centrality.
In section II, we
brieﬂy review some important empirical results of the
North-American airline network, highlighting the most
salient eﬀects on space on diﬀerent quantities. Sections
III and IV are devoted to the presentation and to the
study of the spatial weighted model, stressing the eﬀect
of the spatial embedding and constraints on the proper-
ties of the resulting network. In section V, we present
a summary of the results and conclusions about large
network modeling.

The paper is organized as follows.

is

paramount example of
large scale network which
can be represented as a complex weighted graph: the
airports are the vertices of the graph and the links
represent
the presence of direct ﬂight connections
among them. The weight on each link is the number of
maximum passengers on the corresponding connection.
The characteristics of the world-wide air-transportation
network using the International Air Transportation
Association (IATA) database [34] have been presented
in [14]. The network is made of N = 3880 vertices
and E = 18810 edges and shows both small-world
and scale-free properties as also conﬁrmed in diﬀerent
datasets and analyses [12, 13, 23, 32]. In particular, the
average shortest path length, measured as the average
number of edges separating any two nodes in the network
shows the value hℓi = 4.37, very small compared to the
network size N . The degree distribution, takes the form
P (k) = k−γf (k/kx), where γ ≃ 2.0 and f (k/kx) is an
exponential cut-oﬀ function. The degree distribution is
therefore heavy-tailed with a cut-oﬀ that ﬁnds its origin
in the physical constraints on the maximum number of
connections that a single airport can handle [23, 32, 33].
The airport connection graph is therefore a clear example
of small-world network showing a heavy-tailed degree

distribution and heterogeneous topological properties.

The world-wide airline network necessarily mixes dif-
ferent eﬀects. In particular there are clearly two diﬀerent
scales, global (intercontinental) and domestic. The inter-
continental scale deﬁnes two diﬀerent groups of travel
distances and for the statistical consistency we elimi-
nate this speciﬁc geographical constraint by focusing on
a single continental case. Namely, in the following we
will consider the North-American network constituted of
N = 935 vertices with an average degree hki ≈ 8.4 and an
average shortest path ℓ ≈ 4. The statistical topological
properties of the North American network are consistent
with the world-wide one as we will see in the forthcoming
analysis.

A. Topology and weights

The North American network presents a degree distri-
bution statistically consistent with the world-wide airline
network. Indeed, we also observe (Fig. 1) in this case a
power-law behavior on almost two orders of magnitude
followed by a cut-oﬀ indicating the maximum number of
connections possible due to limited airport capacity and
to the size of the network considered.

The existence of a broad degree distribution signals a
strong heterogeneity of the network at the topological
level which exists also at the weight level. A ﬁrst indica-
tion on the weight heterogeneity is given by the study of
the weight strength of a node i as deﬁned by [14, 35]

sw

(1)

where the sum runs over the set V(i) of neighbors of
i. The strength generalizes the degree to weighted net-
works and in the case of the air transportation network
quantiﬁes the traﬃc of passengers handled by any given
airport. This quantity obviously depends on the degree
k and increases (linearly) with k in the case of random

with an exponent βw > 1, or βw = 1 but A 6= hwi is
then the signature of non-trivial statistical correlations
between weights and topology. This is indeed what we
observe in the North-American air transportation net-
work with βw ≃ 1.7 (Fig. 2).

B. Spatial analysis

The spatial attributes of the North American airport
network are embodied in the physical spatial distance,
measured in kilometers or miles, characterizing each con-
nection. Fig. 3 displays the histogram of the distances
of the direct ﬂights. These distances correspond to Eu-
clidean measures of the links and clearly show a fast de-
caying behavior reasonably ﬁtted by an exponential. The
exponential ﬁt gives a value for a typical scale of the or-
der 1000 kms. The origin of the ﬁnite scale can be traced
back to the existence of physical and economical restric-
tions on airline planning in a continental setting.

Since space is an important parameter in this network,
another interesting quantity is the distance strength of i

sd
i = X
j∈V(i)

dij

(3)

where dij is the Euclidean distance. This quantity gives
the cumulated distances of all the connections from (or
to) the considered airport. Similarly to the usual weight
strength, uncorrelated random connections would lead
to a linear behavior of sd(k) ∝ k while we observe in the
North-American network a power law behavior

sd(k) ∼ kβd

(4)

with βd ≃ 1.4 (Fig. 2). This result shows the presence
of important correlations between topology and geogra-
phy.
Indeed, the fact that the exponents appearing in
the relations (2) and (4) are larger than one have diﬀer-
ent meanings. While Eq. (2) means that larger airports
have connections with larger traﬃc, (4) implies that they
have also farther-reaching connections. In other terms,
the traﬃc (and the distance) per connection is not con-
stant but increases with k. As intuitively expected, the
airline network is an example of a very heterogeneous
network where the hubs have at the same time large con-
nectivities, large weight (traﬃc) and long-distance con-
nections [14], related by super-linear scaling relations.

C. Assortativity and Clustering

A complete characterization of the network structure
must take into account the level of degree correlations
and clustering present in the network. Correlations can
be probed by inspecting the average degree of the nearest
neighbors of a vertex i

knn,i =

1
ki

kj .

X
j∈V(i)

(5)

Averaging this quantity over nodes with same degree k
leads to a convenient measure to investigate the behavior
of the degree correlation function [4, 36]

knn(k) =

knn,i ,

(6)

1
Nk

X
i/ki=k

where Nk is the number of nodes of degree k. This quan-
tity (6) is related to the correlations between the degrees
of connected vertices since on average it can be expressed
as

knn(k) = X
k′

k′P (k′|k) .

(7)

where P (k′|k) is the conditional probability that a given
vertex with degree k is linked to a vertex of degree k′.
If the degrees of neighboring vertices are uncorrelated,
P (k′|k) is only a function of k′ and thus knn(k) is a con-
stant. When correlations are present, two main classes
of possible correlations have been identiﬁed: Assortative
behavior if knn(k) increases with k, which indicates that
large degree vertices are preferentially connected with
other large degree vertices; and disassortative if knn(k)
decreases with k [37]. The weighted generalization of the
above quantity, the aﬃnity, reads as [14]

kw
nn,i =

1
si

X
j∈V(i)

wij kj.

(8)

In this case, we perform a local weighted average of
the nearest neighbor degree according to the normalized
weight of the connecting edges, wij /si. This deﬁnition
implies that kw
nn,i > knn,i if the edges with the larger
weights are pointing to the neighbors with larger degree
and kw
nn,i < knn,i in the opposite case. The kw
nn,i thus
measures the eﬀective aﬃnity to connect with high or
low degree neighbors according to the magnitude of the
actual interactions. As well, the behavior of kw
nn(k), i.e.
the aﬃnity of vertices of degree k, marks the weighted
assortative or disassortative properties considering the
actual interactions among the system’s elements.

Information on the local connectedness is provided by
the clustering coeﬃcient ci deﬁned for any vertex i as
the fraction of connected neighbors of i [38]. The aver-
age clustering coeﬃcient C = N −1
Pi ci thus expresses
the statistical level of cohesiveness measuring the global
density of interconnected vertices’ triples in the networks,
and the function C(k) restricted to classes of vertices with
degree k allows to gather more detailed information. A
possible weighted deﬁnition of the clustering coeﬃcient
is provided by the expression

cw(i) =

1

si(ki − 1) X

j,h∈V(i)

(wij + wih)
2

ajh,

(9)

where ajh is equal to 1 if j and h are linked, and 0 other-
wise. The quantity cw(i) takes into account the weight of
the two participating edges of the vertex i for each triple
formed in the neighborhood of the vertex i; it measures
the relative weight of the triangles in the neighborhood
of a vertex i with respect to the vertex’ strength [14]. Cw
and Cw(k) are deﬁned as the average over all nodes and
over nodes of degree k, respectively. It is worth remark-
ing that alternative deﬁnitions of the weighting scheme
for clustering have been proposed in the literature [39].
Figure 4 displays for the North-American airport net-
work the behavior of these various quantities as a func-
tion of the degree. An essentially ﬂat knn(k) is obtained
and a slight disassortative trend is observed at large k,
due to the fact that large airports have in fact many
intercontinental connections to other hubs which are lo-
cated outside of North America and are not considered

in this “regional” network. The clustering is very large
and slightly decreasing at large k. This behavior is of-
ten observed in complex networks and is here a direct
consequence of the role of large airports that provide
non-stop connections to diﬀerent regions which are not
interconnected among them. Moreover, weighted correla-
tions are systematically larger than the topological ones,
signaling that large weights are concentrated on links
between large airports which form well inter-connected
cliques (see also [14] for more details).

D. Betweenness Centrality

A further characterization of the network is provided
by considering quantities that takes into account the
global topology of the network. For instance, the de-
gree of a vertex is a local measure that gives a ﬁrst in-
dication of its centrality. However, a more global ap-
proach is needed in order to characterize the real im-
portance of various nodes. Indeed, some particular low-
degree vertices may be essential because they provide
connections between otherwise separated parts of the net-
work. In order to take properly into account such ver-
tices, the betweenness centrality (BC) is commonly used
[40, 41, 42, 43]. The betweenness centrality of a node v
is deﬁned as

g(v) = X
s6=t

σst(v)
σst

(10)

where σst is the number of shortest paths going from s to
t and σst(v) is the number of shortest paths going from
s to t and passing through v. This deﬁnition means that
central nodes are part of more shortest paths within the
network than peripheral nodes. Moreover, the between-
ness centrality gives in transport networks an estimate
of the traﬃc handled by the vertices, assuming that the
number of shortest paths is a zero-th order approxima-
tion to the frequency of use of a given node. It is generally

largest the centrality. For scale-free networks it has been
shown that the centrality scales with k as

g(k) ∼ kµ

(12)

where µ depends on the network [41, 42, 43]. For some
networks however, the BC ﬂuctuations around the be-
havior given by Eq. (12) can be very large and “anoma-
lies” can occur, in the sense that the variation of the
centrality versus degree is not a monotonous function.
Guimer`a and Amaral [23] have shown that this is indeed
the case for the air-transportation network. This is a
very relevant observation in that very central cities may
have a relatively low degree and vice versa.
In Fig. 5
we report the average behavior along with the scattered
plot of the betweenness versus degree of all airports of
the North American network. Also in this case we ﬁnd
very large ﬂuctuations with a behavior similar to those
observed in Ref. [23]. Interestingly, Guimer`a and Ama-
ral have put forward a network model embedded in real
space that considers geopolitical constraints. This model
appears to reproduce the betweenness centrality features
observed in the real network pointing out the importance
of space as a relevant ingredient in the structure of net-
works. In the following we focus on the interplay between
spatial embedding, topology and weights in a simple gen-
eral model for weighted networks in order to provide a
modeling framework considering these three aspects at
once.

III. THE MODEL

5

Early modeling of weighted networks just considered
weight and topology as uncorrelated quantities [35]. This
is not the case in real world networks where a complex in-
terplay between the evolution of weights and topological
growth does exist. For instance, if a new airline con-
nection between two airports is created, it will generally
provoke a modiﬁcation of the existing traﬃc of both air-
ports. In general, it will increase the traﬃc activity de-
pending on the speciﬁc nature of the network and on the
local dynamics. This eﬀect is introduced in the model-
ing of growing networks by the mechanism of a strength
preferential attachment together with a dynamical redis-
tribution of weights. Following this strategy it is possible
to produce weighted networks with broad distributions of
weights, connectivities, and strengths, and correlations
between weights and topology [24, 25].

Here we consider a weighted growing network whose
nodes are embedded in a two-dimensional space. As in
the weighted model of Ref. [24], it is reasonable to think
that a newly created node n will establish links towards
pre-existing nodes with heavy traﬃc or strength (hubs).
Costs are however associated with distances and there is
a trade-oﬀ between the need to reach a hub in a few hops
and the connection costs. The cost naturally increases
with the distance implying that the probability of estab-
lishing a connection between the new node n and a given
vertex i decays as a function of the increasing Euclidean
distance dni. As in the case of topological preferential
attachment (i.e. connecting probability proportional to
the degree [44]), this trade-oﬀ can be expressed in two
diﬀerent ways: the connecting probability can decrease
either as a power-law of the distance [45, 46, 47] or as
an exponential with a ﬁnite typical scale [22] as it seems
more natural for networks such as transportation net-
works (see Fig. 3) or technological networks [48]. All the
eﬀects described in the next paragraphs are obtained in
the case of an exponential decay exp(−dni/rc) but are
also present in the case of a power-law d−a
ni (the eﬀect
of a decreasing scale rc is qualitatively the same as the
eﬀect of an increasing exponent a). Eventually, the cre-
ation of new edges will introduce new traﬃc which will
trigger perturbations in the network. This model there-
fore consists of two combined mechanisms:

1. Growth. We start with an initial seed of N0 vertices
randomly located (with uniform distribution) on a
2-dimensional disk (of radius L) and connected by
links with assigned weight w0. At each time step, a
new vertex n is placed on the disk at a randomly as-
signed position xn (still according to a uniform dis-
tribution). This new site is connected to m previ-
ously existing vertices, choosing preferentially near-
est sites with the largest strength. More precisely,
a node i is chosen according to the probability

Πn→i =

i e−dni/rc
sw
Pj sw

j e−dnj/rc

,

(13)

where rc is a typical scale and dni is the Euclidean
distance between n and i. This rule of strength
driven preferential attachment with spatial selec-
tion, generalizes the preferential attachment mech-
anism driven by the strength to spatial networks.
Here, new vertices connect more likely to vertices
which correspond to the best interplay between Eu-
clidean distance and strength.

2. Weights dynamics. The weight of each new edge
(n, i) is ﬁxed to a given value w0 (this value sets
a scale so we can take w0 = 1). The creation of
this edge will perturb the existing interactions and
we consider local perturbations for which only the
weights between i and its neighbors j ∈ V(i) are
modiﬁed

wij → wij + δ

(14)

wij
sw
i

.

After the weights have been updated, the growth process
is iterated by introducing a new vertex, i.e. going back to
step (1.) until the desired size of the network is reached.
The previous rules have simple physical and realistic
interpretations. Equation (13) corresponds to the fact
that new sites try to connect to existing vertices with
the largest strength, with the constraint that the con-
nection cannot be too costly. This adaptation of the rule
“busy get busier” introduced in [24, 25] allows to take
into account physical constraints. The weights’ dynam-
ics Eq. (14) expresses the perturbation created by the
addition of the new node and link. It yields a global in-
crease of w0 + δ for the strength of i, which will therefore
become even more attractive for future nodes.

The value of δ characterizes the susceptibility of the
network. If δ < w0, the new link does not have a large
inﬂuence. The case δ ≈ w0 corresponds to situations
for which the new created traﬃc (on the new link n − i)
is transferred onto the already existing connections in a
“conservative” way. Finally, δ > w0 is an extreme case in
which a new edge generates a sort of multiplicative eﬀect
that is bursting the weight or traﬃc on neighbors.

The model contains two relevant parameters: the ra-
tio between the typical scale and the size of the system
η = rc/L, and the ability to redistribute weights, δ. De-
pending on the value of η and δ we obtain diﬀerent net-
works whose limiting cases are summarized in Figure 6.
More precisely, we expect:

• For η ≫ 1, the eﬀect of distance is negligible and
we recover the properties of the weighted model

distributions for connectivities and strengths with
exponent γ = (4δ + 3)/(2δ + 1), as well as for the
weights (exponent α = 2 + 1/δ). The strength and
degree are linearly related by sw(k) ≃ (2δ + 1)k.
The eﬀect of the redistribution parameter δ is to
broaden the various probability distributions, and
to increase the correlations between topology and
weights. Moreover, no correlations are introduced

between the topology of the network and the under-
lying two-dimensional space, so that the distance
strength sd grows simply linearly with the degree.

• When η decreases, additional constraints appear
and have consequences that we will investigate nu-
merically in the following. Unless otherwise speci-
ﬁed, the simulations correspond to the parameters
m = 3 (i.e. an average degree hki = 6), and δ = 1.0.
We consider networks of size up to N = 10, 000, and
the results are averaged over up to 100 realizations.
All the observed dependences in η are essentially
the same for other investigated values of δ.

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS

A. Topology and weights

At a purely topological level, the principal eﬀect of a
typical ﬁnite scale rc in the creation of new connections
is to introduce a cut-oﬀ in the scale-free degree distri-
butions [22].
In Fig. 7 we report the degree distribu-
tion for a ﬁxed value of δ and decreasing values η. A
more pronounced cut-oﬀ appears at decreasing value of
η signalling the onset of a trade-oﬀ between the num-
ber of connections and their cost in terms of Euclidean
distance. The small-world properties of the network are
as-well modiﬁed [22]: on the one hand, the increasing ten-
dency to establish connections in the geographical neigh-
borhood favors the formation of cliques and leads to an
increase in the clustering coeﬃcient (see inset of Fig. 8).
On the other hand, this same tendency leads to an in-
crease in the diameter of the graph, measured as the aver-
age shortest path distances between pairs of nodes. The
diameter however still increases logarithmically with the
size of the graph, as shown in Fig. 8: the constructed net-
works do display the small-world property, even if strong
geographical constraints are present.

The correlations appearing between traﬃc and topol-
ogy of the network are presented in Fig. 9 for two extreme
cases of large and small η. Strikingly, the eﬀect of the
spatial constraint is to increase both exponents βw and
βd to values larger than 1 and although the redistribu-
tion of the weights [Eq. (14)] is linear, non-linear rela-
tions sw(k) and sd(k) as a function of k appear. For the

weight strength the eﬀect is not very pronounced with
an exponent of order βw ≈ 1.1 for η = 0.01, while for the
distance strength the non-linearity has an exponent of
order βd ≈ 1.27 for η = 0.02 (the value of the exponents
βw and βd depend on η; see also [49] for a spatial model
with βd > 1). We show on Fig. 9 the distance strength
for two extreme situations for which spatial constraints
are inexistent (η = 10.0) or on the contrary very strong
(η = 0.02).

The nonlinearity induced by the spatial structure can
be explained by the following mechanism aﬀecting the
network growth. The increase of spatial constraints af-
fects the trend to form global hubs, since long distance
connections are less probable, and drives the topology
towards the existence of “regional” hubs of smaller de-
gree. The total traﬃc however is not changed with re-
spect to the case η = ∞, and is in fact directed towards
these “regional” hubs. These medium-large degree ver-
tices therefore carry a much larger traﬃc than they would
do if global “hubs” were available, leading to a faster in-
crease of the traﬃc as a function of the degree, eventually

(the networks are obtained for δ = 1, N = 10
averaged over 100 conﬁgurations). When η is not small, space
is irrelevant and there are no correlations between degree and
space. When spatial eﬀects are important (η = 0.02 ≪ 1),
non-linear correlations appear. We observe a crossover for
k ≃ 10 − 20 to a power-law behavior and the power-law ﬁt
over this range of values of k is shown (full lines).

resulting in a super-linear behavior. Moreover, as previ-
ously mentioned, the increase in distance costs implies
that long range connections can be established only to-
wards the hubs of the system: this eﬀect naturally lead
to a super-linear accumulation of sd(k) at larger degree
values.

Spatial constraints have also a strong eﬀect on the
correlations between neighboring nodes (Fig. 10). At
large η, a disassortative network is created, as is the case
in most growing networks [50]; as η decreases, knn de-
creases, and an increasing range of ﬂat knn(k) appears:
the tendency for small nodes to connect to hubs is con-
trasted by the need to use small-range links. For small
enough η, a nearly neutral behavior more similar to what
is actually observed in the airport network is reached.
Moreover, the aﬃnity of nodes to establish strong links
to large nodes, measured by kw
nn(k), goes from a ﬂat be-
havior at large η to a slightly assortative one at small
η. In all cases, the weighted correlation kw
nn(k) remains
clearly larger than the unweighted knn(k), showing that
links to busier nodes are typically stronger.

A non-trivial clustering hierarchy is already displayed
by the model without spatial constraints. As previously
mentioned, the decrease of η leads to an increase of clus-
tering. Moreover, the weighted clustering is always signif-
icantly larger than the unweighted one, showing that the
cliques carry typically an important traﬃc (see Fig. 10).
These eﬀects are a general signature of spatial constraints
as also observed in a non weighted network [22].

B. Spatial constraints and betweenness centrality

The spatial constraints act at both local and global
level of the network structure by introducing a distance
cost in the establishment of connections. It is therefore
important to look at the eﬀect of space in global topolog-
ical quantities such as the betweenness centrality. The

betweenness centrality of a vertex is determined by its
ability to provide a path between separated regions of
the network. Hubs are natural crossroads for paths and
it is natural to observe a marked correlation between g
and k as expressed in the general relation g(k) ∼ kµ.
The exponent µ depends on the characteristics of the net-
work and we expect this relation to be altered when spa-
tial constraints become important. In the present model,
Fig. 11 clearly shows that this correlation in fact increases
when spatial constraints become large (i.e. when η de-
creases). This can be understood simply by the fact that
the probability to establish far-reaching short-cuts de-
creases exponentially in Eq. (13) and only the large traﬃc
of hubs can compensate this decay. Far-away geographi-
cal regions can thus only be linked by edges connected to
large degree vertices, which implies a more central role
for these hubs.

In order to better understand the eﬀect of space on the
properties of betweenness centrality, we have to explic-
itly consider the geometry of the network along with the
topology. In particular, we need to consider the role of
the spatial position by introducing the spatial barycen-
ter of the network.
Indeed, in the presence of a spa-
tial structure, the centrality of nodes is correlated with
their position with respect to the barycenter G, whose
xi/N . For a spatially or-
location is given by xG = Pi
dered network—the simplest case being a lattice embed-
ded in a one-dimensional space—the shortest path be-
tween two nodes is simply the Euclidean geodesic. In a
limited region, for two points lying far away, the probabil-

lattice case. The central nodes are close to the barycenter. (b)
For a general graph, the central nodes are usually the ones
with large degree.

ity that the shortest path passes near the barycenter of all
nodes is very large. In other words, this implies that the
barycenter (and its neighbors) will have a large centrality.
In a purely topological network with no underlying geog-
raphy, this consideration does not apply anymore and the
full randomness and the disordered small world structure
are completely uncorrelated with the spatial position. It
is worth remarking that the present argument applies in
the absence of periodic boundary conditions that would
destroy the geometrical ordering. This point is illustrated
in Fig. 12 in the simple case of a one-dimensional lattice.
The present model deﬁnes an intermediate situation in
that we have a random network with space constraints
that introduces a local structure since short distance con-
nections are favored. Shortcuts and long distance hops
are present along with a spatial local structure that clus-
ters spatially neighboring vertices. In Fig. 13 we plot the
average distance d(G, C) between the barycenter G and
the 10 most central nodes. As expected, as spatial con-
straints become more important, the most central nodes
get closer to the spatial barycenter of the network.

Another eﬀect observed when the spatial constraints
become important are the large ﬂuctuations of the BC.

FIG. 13: Average Euclidean distance between the barycenter
G of all nodes and the 10 most central nodes (C) versus the
parameter η (Here δ = 0, N = 5, 000 and the results are
averaged over 50 conﬁgurations). When space is important
(ie. small η), the central nodes are closer to the gravity center.
For large η, space is irrelevant and the average distance tends
to the value corresponding to a uniform distribution hriunif =
2/3 (dotted line).

straints increase). (b) Number of anomalies Na(k) rescaled

Fig. 14a displays the relative ﬂuctuation

,

hg(k)i

(15)

where hδg2(k)i is the variance of the BC and hg(k)i its
average (computed for each value of k). The value of
η modiﬁes the degree cut-oﬀ and in order to be able to
compare the results for diﬀerent values of η we rescale
the abscissa by its maximum value kmax. This plot
(Fig. 14a) clearly shows that the BC relative ﬂuctuations
increase as η decreases and become quite large. This
means that nodes with small degree may have a rela-
tively large BC (or the opposite), as observed in the air-
transportation network (see Fig. 5 and [23]). In order to
quantify these “anomalies” we compute the ﬂuctuations
of the betweenness centrality ∆RN (k) for a randomized
network with the same degree distribution than the orig-
inal network and constructed with the Molloy-Reed algo-
rithm [51]. We consider a node i as being “anomalous”
if its betweenness centrality g(i) lies outside the interval
[hg(k)i − α∆RN (k), hg(k)i + α∆RN (k)], where we choose
α ≃ 1.952 so that the considered interval would repre-
sent 95% of the nodes in the case of Gaussian distributed
centralities around the average. In Fig. 14b, we show the
relative number of anomalies versus k/kkmax for diﬀer-
ent values of η. This plot shows that the relative num-
ber of anomalies Na(k)/Nk increases when the degree
increases and more interestingly strongly increases when
η decreases. Note that since for increasing k the number
of nodes Nk is getting small, the results become more
noisy.

The results of Figs. (11-14) can be summarized as fol-
lows. In a purely topological growing network, central-
ity is strongly correlated with degree since hubs have a
natural ability to provide connections between otherwise
separated regions or neighborhoods [43]. As spatial con-
straints appear and become more important, two factors
compete in determining the most central nodes: (i) on

the one hand hubs become even more important in terms
of centrality since only a large traﬃc can compensate for
the cost of long-range connections which implies that the
correlations between degree and centrality become thus
even stronger; (ii) on the other hand, many paths go
through the neighborhood of the barycenter, reinforcing
the centrality of less-connected nodes that happen to be
in the right place; this yields larger ﬂuctuations of g and
a larger number of “anomalies”.

We ﬁnally note that these eﬀects are not qualitatively
aﬀected by the weight structure and we observe the same
behavior for δ = 0 or δ 6= 0.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we have presented a model of growing
weighted networks introducing the eﬀect of space and ge-
ometry in the establishment of new connections. When
spatial constraints appear, the eﬀects on the network
structure can be summarized as follows:

• (i) Eﬀect of spatial embedding on topology-traﬃc

correlations
Spatial constraints induce strong nonlinear correla-
tions between topology and traﬃc. The reason for
this behavior is that spatial constraints favor the
formation of regional hubs and reinforces locally the
preferential attachment, leading for a given degree
to a larger strength than the one observed with-
out spatial constraints. Moreover, long-distance
links can connect only to hubs, which yields a value
βd > 1 for small enough η. The existence of con-
straints such as spatial distance selection induces
some strong correlations between topology (degree)
and non-topological quantities such as weights or
distances.

• (ii) Eﬀect of space embedding on centrality

Spatial constraints also induce large betweenness
centrality ﬂuctuations. While hubs are usually very
central, when space is important central nodes tend
to get closer to the gravity center of all points.
Correlations between spatial position and central-
ity compete with the usual correlations between de-
gree and centrality, leading to the observed large
ﬂuctuations of centrality at ﬁxed degree.

• (iii) Eﬀect of space embedding on clustering and as-

sortativity
Spatial constraints implies that the tendency to
connect to hubs is limited by the need to use small-
range links. This explains the almost ﬂat behav-
ior observed for the assortativity. Connection costs
also favor the formation of cliques between spatially
close nodes and thus increase the clustering coeﬃ-
cient.

Including spatial eﬀects in a simple model of weighted
networks thus yields a large variety of behavior and in-

10

teresting eﬀects. This study sheds some light on the im-
portance and eﬀect of diﬀerent ingredients such as spa-
tial embedding or diversity of interaction weights in the
structure of large complex networks and we believe that
this attempt of a network typology could be useful in the
understanding and modeling of real-world networks.

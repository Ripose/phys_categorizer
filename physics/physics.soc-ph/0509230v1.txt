Abstract

We model the Internet as a network of interconnected Autonomous Systems which self-organize

under an absolute lack of centralized control. Our aim is to capture how the Internet evolves

by reproducing the assembly that has led to its actual structure and, to this end, we propose a

growing weighted network model driven by competition for resources and adaptation to maintain

functionality in a demand and supply “equilibrium”. On the demand side, we consider the envi-

ronment, a pool of users which need to transfer information and ask for service. On the supply

side, ASs compete to gain users, but to be able to provide service eﬃciently, they must adapt their

bandwidth as a function of their size. Hence, the Internet is not modeled as an isolated system but

the environment, in the form of a pool of users, is also a fundamental part which must be taken into

account. ASs compete for users and big and small come up, so that not all ASs are identical. New

connections between ASs are made or old ones are reinforced according to the adaptation needs.

Thus, the evolution of the Internet can not be fully understood if just described as a technological

isolated system. A socio-economic perspective must also be considered.

INTRODUCTION

In an attempt to bring nearer theory and reality, many researchers working on the

new and rapidly evolving science of complex networks [1] have recently shifted focus from

unweighted graphs to weighted networks. Commonly, interactions between elements in

network-representable complex real systems -may they be communication systems, such as

the Internet, or transportation infrastructures, social communities, biological or biochemical

systems- are not of the same magnitude. It seems natural that the ﬁrst more simple rep-

resentations, where edges between pairs of vertices are quantiﬁed just as present or absent,

give way to more complex ones, where edges are no longer in binary states but may stand

for connections of diﬀerent strength.

Weight is just one of the relevant ingredients in bringing network modeling closer to

reality. Others come from the fact that real systems are not static but evolve. As broadly

recognized, growth and preferential attachment are also key issues at the core of a set of

recent network models focusing on evolution under an statistical physics approach [2, 3,

4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. This models have been able to approximate some topological features

observed in many real networks –speciﬁcally the small-world property or a power-law degree

distribution– as a result of the organizing principles acting at each stage of the network

formation process. Although a great step forward in the understanding of the laws that

shape network evolution, these new degree driven models cannot describe other empirical

properties. Further on, in order to achieve representations that closely match reality, it is

necessary to uncover new mechanisms.

Following this motivation, we believe that the general view of networks as isolated sys-

tems, although possibly appropriate in some cases, must be changed if we want to describe

in a proper way complex systems which not generate spontaneously but self-organize within

a medium in order to perform a function. Many networks evolve in an environment to which

they interact and which usually provides the clues to understand functionality. Therefore,

rules deﬁned on the basis of internal mechanisms alone, such as preferential attachment that

acts internally at the local scale to connect nodes trough edges, are not enough. When

analyzing the dynamics of network assembly, the interlock of its constituents with the envi-

ronment cannot be systematically obviated.

With the aim of approaching applicability, in this work we blend all ideas above to present

2

a growing network model in which both, nodes and links, are weighted [10]. The dynamical

evolution is driven by exponential growth, competition for resources and adaptation to

maintain functionality in a demand and supply “equilibrium”, key mechanisms which may

be relevant in a wide range of self-organizing systems, in particular those where functionality

is tied to communication or traﬃc. The medium in which the network grows and to with it

interacts is here represented by a pool of elements which, at the same time, provide resources

to the constituents of the network and demand functionality, say for instance users in the

case of the Internet [11] or passengers in the case of the world-wide airport network [12].

Competition is here understood as a struggle between network nodes for new resources and is

modeled as a rich get richer (preferential attachment) process. For their part, this captured

elements demand functionality so that nodes must adapt in order to perform eﬃciently. This

adaptation translates into the creation of weighted links between nodes.

In this work, we apply those ideas to the Internet. In the realm of complexity theory,

the Internet is a paradigmatic example and signiﬁcant eﬀorts has been devoted to the de-

velopment of models which reproduce the topological properties observed in its maps [11].

Candidates run from topology generators [13, 14] to degree driven growing networks mod-

els [15, 16] or Highly Optimized Tolerance (HOT) models [17]. Some of them reproduce

heavy-tailed degree distributions and small-world properties, but perform poorly when esti-

mating correlations or other characteristic properties, such as the rich-club phenomenon or

the k-core structure. By contrast, we will show that our model nicely reproduces an over-

whelming number of observed topological features: the small-world property, the scale-free

degree distribution P (k), high clustering coeﬃcient ck that shows a hierarchical structure,

disassortative degree-degree correlations, quantiﬁed by means of the average nearest neigh-
bors degree of nodes of degree k, ¯knn(k) [18], the scaling of the higher order loop structure

recently analyzed in [19], the distributions of the betweenness centrality, P (b), and trian-

gles passing through a node, P (T ), and, ﬁnally, the k-core decomposition uncovering its

hierarchical organization [20, 21].

We will consider the Internet evolution at the Autonomous System (AS) level. ASs

are deﬁned as independently administered domains which autonomously determine internal

communications and routing policies [11] and, as a ﬁrst approximation, we can assign each

AS to an Internet Service Provider (ISP). This level of description means a coarse grained

representation of the Internet. Nevertheless, further detail is not necessary when aiming to

3

explain and predict the large-scale behavior. Thus, the network will be made up of ASs as

nodes connected among them with links which can be of diﬀerent strength or bandwidth.

On the side of the environment modeling, we place hosts on the level as users.

In the next sections we analyze the growth of the Internet over the last years. Then

we present the model. Working in the continuum approximation, we ﬁnd analytically the

distribution of the sizes (in number of users) of ASs and the degree distribution. Then, we

introduce an algorithm in order to simulate network assembly. At this stage, we also make a

ﬁrst attempt to the consideration of geographical constraints. Finally, the synthetic networks

are compared to the real maps of the Internet through a variety of diﬀerent measures.

II. THE GROWTH OF THE INTERNET

Let W (t) be the total number of users in the environmental pool at a given time t,

measured as hosts. N(t) and E(t) stand for the number of ASs and edges among them

in the network, respectively. Empirical measures for the growth in the number of users

have been obtained from the Hobbes Internet Timeline [22]. The growth of the network is

analyzed from AS maps collected by the Oregon route-views project, which has recorded data

since November 1997 [23]. According to those observations, shown in Fig.1, we will assume

exponential growths for these quantities, W (t) ≈ W0eαt, N(t) ≈ N0eβt, and E(t) ≈ E0eδt.

These exponential growths, in turn, determine the scaling relations with the system size:
W ∝ N α/β, E ∝ N δ/β and hki ∝ N δ/β−1.

The rates of growth can be measured to be α = 0.036 ± 0.001, β = 0.0304 ± 0.0003,

and δ = 0.0330 ± 0.0002 (units are month−1), where α >
quite close to each other but they are not equal. In fact, the inequality α >

∼ β. These three rates are
∼ β must hold
in order to preserve network functionality. When the number of users increases at a rate α,

∼ δ >

there are two mechanisms capable to compensate the demand they represent: the creation

of new nodes and the creation of new connections by nodes already present in the network.

When both mechanisms take place simultaneously, the rate of growth of new nodes, β, as

well as the rate for the number of connections, δ, must necessarily be smaller than α. Any

other situation would lead to an imbalance between demand and supply of service in the

system. On the other hand, in a connected network, δ must be equal or greater than β. If δ

equals β the average number of connections per node, or average degree, remains constant

in time, whereas it increases when δ >

∼ β. This increase could correspond to a demand per
user which is not constant but grows in time, probably due to the increase of the power of

computers over time and, as a consequence, to the ability to transfer bigger ﬁles or to use

more demanding applications.

III. THE MODEL

We deﬁne our model according to the following rules: (i) At rate αW (t), new users join

the system and choose node i according to some preference function, Πi({ωj(t)}), where

ωj(t), j = 1, · · · , N(t), is the number of users already connected to node j at time t. The

function Πi({ωj(t)}) is normalized so that

i Πi({ωj(t)}) = 1 at any time. (ii) At rate
P
βN(t), new nodes join the network with an initial number of users, ω0, randomly withdrawn

from the pool of users already attached to existing nodes. Therefore, ω0 can be understood

as the minimum number of users required to keep nodes in business. (iii) At rate λ, each

user changes his AS and chooses a new one using the same preference function Πi({ωj(t)}).

Finally, (iv) each node tries to adapt its number of connections to other nodes according to

its present number of users or size, in an attempt to provide them an adequate functionality.

With all speciﬁcations above, we will work in the continuum approximation to ﬁnd some

analytic results, speciﬁcally the distribution of the sizes of ASs and the degree distribution.

5

A. Analytic results

equation

The resource dynamics of single nodes is described by the following stochastic diﬀerential

dωi
dt

= A(ωi, t) + [D(ωi, t)]1/2 ξ(t),

(1)

where ωi is the number of users attached to AS i at time t. The time dependent drift is

A(ωi, t) = (α + λ)W (t)Πi − λωi − βω0, and the diﬀusion term is D(ωi, t) = (α + λ)W (t)Πi +

λωi + βω0 − 2λωiΠi. Application of the Central Limit Theorem guaranties the convergence

of the noise ξ(t) to a gaussian white noise in the limit W (t) ≫ 1. The ﬁrst term in the

expression for the drift is a creation term accounting for new and old users that choose node

i. The second term represent those users who decide to change their node and, ﬁnally, the

last term corresponds to the decrease of users due to introduction of newly created nodes. To

proceed further, we need to specify the preference function Πi({ωj(t)}). We assume that, as

a result of a competition process, nodes bigger in resources get users more easily than small

ones. The simplest function satisfying this condition corresponds to the linear preference,

that is, Πi({ωj(t)}) = ωi/W (t), where W (t) = ω0N0 exp (αt). In this case, the stochastic

diﬀerential equation (1) reads

dωi
dt

= αωi − βω0 + [(α + 2λ)ωi + βω0]1/2 ξ(t).

(2)

Notice that reallocation of users (i.e.

the λ-term) only increases the diﬀusive part in

Eq. (2) but has no net eﬀect in the drift term, which is, eventually, the leading term.

The complete solution of this problem requires to solve the Fokker-Planck equation corre-

sponding to Eq. (2) with a reﬂecting boundary condition at ω = ω0 and initial conditions

p(ωi, ti|ω0, ti) = δ(ωi − ω0) (δ(·) stands for the Dirac delta function). Here p(ωi, t|ω0, ti) is

the probability that node i has a number of users ωi at time t given that it had ω0 at time

ti. The choice of a reﬂecting boundary condition at ω = ω0 is equivalent to assume that β

is the overall growth rate of the number of nodes, that is, the composition of the birth and

dead processes ruling the evolution of the number of nodes.

Finding the solution for this problem is not an easy task. Fortunately, we can take

advantage of the fact that, when α > β, the average number of users of each node increases

exponentially and, since D(ωi, t) = O (A(ωi, t)), ﬂuctuations vanishes in the long time limit.

Under this zero noise approximation, the number of users connected to a node introduced

where we have deﬁned τ ≡ β/α and the cut-oﬀ is given by ωc(t) ∼ (1 − τ )ω0eαt ∼ W (t).

Thus, in the long time limit, p(ω, t) approaches a stationary distribution with an increasing

cut-oﬀ that scales linearly with the total number of users. The exponent τ depends on the

relative values of β and α, which can be diﬀerent but typically would stay close so that τ

would value around 2.

The key point now is to construct a bridge between the competition and the adaptation

mechanisms, in other words, to see how to relate the number of users attached to an AS with

its degree and bandwidth. Our basic assumption is that vertices are continuously adapting

their strength or bandwidth, the total weight of its connections, to the number of users they

have. However, once a node decides to increase its bandwidth it has to ﬁnd a peer who, at

the same time, wants to increase its bandwidth as well. The reason is that connection costs

among nodes must be assumed by both peers. This fact diﬀers from other growing models in

which vertices do not ask target vertices if they really want to form those connections. Our

model is, then, to be thought of as a coupling between a competition process for users and

adaptation of vertices to their current situation, with the constraint that connections are only

formed between “active” nodes, that is, those ASs with a positive increment of their number

of users. Let bi(t|ti) be the total bandwidth of a node at time t given that it was introduced at

time ti. This quantity can include single connections with other nodes, i. e. the topological

degree k, but it also accounts for connections which have higher capacity. This is equivalent

to say that the network is, in fact, weighted and bi is the weighted degree. To simplify the

model we consider that bandwidth is discretized in such a way that single connections with

high capacity are equivalent to multiple connections between the same nodes. Then, when

a pair of nodes agrees to increase their mutual connectivity the connection is newly formed

if they were not previously connected or, if they were, their mutual bandwidth increases by

7

one unit, reinforcing in this way their connectivity. Now, we assume that, at time t, each

node adapts its total bandwidth proportionally to its number of users, or size, following a

lineal relation. Thus, we can write

bi(t|ti) = 1 + a(t) (ωi(t|ti) − ω0) .

(6)

Summing Eq. (6) for all nodes we get a(t) = (2B(t)−N(t))/(W (t)−ω0N(t)) ≈ 2B(t)/W (t),

where B(t) is the total bandwidth of the network. B(t) is, obviously, an upper bound to

the total number of edges of the network. This suggests that B(t) will grow according to
B(t) = B0eδ′t. As the number of users grows, the global traﬃc of the Internet also grows,
which means that nodes do not only adapt their bandwidth to their number of users but

to the global traﬃc of the network. Therefore, a(t) must be an increasing function of t,

which, in turn, implies that δ′ > α and, thus, δ′ > δ. As a consequence, the network

must necessarily contain multiple connections. This can be explicitly seen by inspecting
the scaling of the maximum bandwidth, which reads bc(t) ∝ N(t)δ′/β, that is, faster than
N(t). Therefore, the topological degree of a node cannot be proportional to its bandwidth.

Nevertheless, it is clear that ki and bi are positive correlated random variables. We then

propose that degree and bandwidth are related, in a statistical sense, through the following

scaling relation

k(t|ti) = [b(t|ti)]µ ,

µ < 1,

(7)

which implies that all nodes can form multiple connections, regardless of their size. This

scaling behavior has recently been observed in other weighted networks [12, 24]. The su-

perlinear behavior of bc(t), combined with this scaling relation, ensures that rich ASs will

connect to a macroscopic portion of the system, so that the maximum degree will scale lin-

early with the system size. Empirical measurements made in [4] showed such linear scaling
in the AS with the largest degree. This sets the scaling exponent to µ = β/δ′.

All four growth rates in the model are not independent but can be related by exploring

the interplay between bandwidth, connectivity, and traﬃc of the network. Summing Eq. (7)
for all vertices, the scaling of the total number of connections is E(t) ∝ N(t)2−α/δ′
, which
leads to δ′ = αβ/(2β − δ). Combining this relation with Eqs. (5), (6) and (7), the degree

distribution reads

for k ≫ 1, where the exponent γ takes the value γ = 1 + 1/(2 − δ/β). Strikingly, the

exponent γ has lost any direct dependence on α becoming a function of the ratio δ/β. Using

the empirical values for β and δ, the predicted exponent is γ = 2.2 ± 0.1, in excellent

agreement with the values reported in the literature [18, 25]. Of course, this does not mean

that the exponent γ is independent of α, since both, β and δ, may depend on the growth

of the number of users. Anyway, our model turns out to depend on just two independent

parameters which can be expressed as ratios of the rates of growth, β/α and δ/β.

B. Simulations

So far, we have been mainly interested in the degree distribution of the AS map but

not in the speciﬁc way in which the network is formed. To ﬁll this gap we have performed

numerical simulations that generate network topologies in nice agreement with real measures

of the Internet. Although ASs are distributed systems, we assume they follow the same

spatial distribution as the one measured for routers, so that we are able to deﬁne a physical

distance among them to take into account connection costs [9]. Our algorithm, following

the lines of the model, works in four steps:

1. At iteration t, ∆W (t) = ω0N0(eαt −eα(t−1)) users join the network and choose provider

among the existing nodes using the linear preference rule.

2. ∆N(t) = N0(eβt − eβ(t−1)) new ASs are introduced with ω0 users each, those being

randomly withdrawn from already existing ASs. Newly created ASs are located in a

two dimensional plane following a fractal set of dimension Df = 1.5 [9].

3. Each AS evaluate its increase of bandwidth, ∆bi(t|ti), according to Eq. (6).

4. A pair of nodes, (i, j), is chosen with probability proportional to ∆bi(t|ti) and ∆bj(t|tj)

respectively, and, whenever they both need to increase their bandwidth, they form a

connection with probability D(dij, ωi, ωj). This function takes into consideration that,

due to connection costs, physical links over long distances are unlikely to be created by

small peers. Once the ﬁrst connection has been formed, they create a new connection

with probability r, whenever they still need to increase their bandwidth. This step is

repeated until all nodes have the desired bandwidth.

9

It is important to stress the fact that nodes must be chosen with probability proportional

to their increase in bandwidth at each step. The reason is that those nodes that need

a high bandwidth increase will be more active when looking for partners to whom form

connections. Another important point is the role of the parameter r. This parameter takes

into account the balance between the costs of forming connections with new peers and the

need for diversiﬁcation in the number of partners. The eﬀect of r in the network topology

is to tune the average degree and the clustering coeﬃcient by modulating the number of

multiple connections. The exponent γ is unaﬀected except in the limiting case r → 1. In this

situation, big peers will create a huge amount of multiple connections among them, reducing,

thus, the maximum degree of the network. Finally, we chose an exponential form for the
distance probability function D(dij, ωi, ωj) = e−dij /dc(ωi,ωj), where dc(ωi, ωj) = ωiωj/κW (t)

and κ is a cost function of number of users per unit distance, depending on the maximum

distance of the fractal set. All simulations are performed using ω0 = 5000, N0 = 2, B0 = 1,
α = 0.035, β = 0.03, and δ′ = 0.04. The ﬁnal size of the networks is N ≈ 11000, which

approximately corresponds to the size of the actual maps for 2001 that we are considering

in this work.

IV. TESTING THE MODEL

To test the model we construct synthetic networks from our algorithm with and with-

out taking into consideration the geographical distribution of ASs, and we contrast several

measures on those graphs to those of real maps, more speciﬁcally, the AS map dated May

2001 from data collected by the Oregon Route Views Project [23], and the AS extended

(AS+) map [26] which completes the previous one with data from other sources. Let us

note that all the measures presented here are performed over the same synthetic networks.

The parameters of the model are ﬁxed once and for all before generating the networks so

that they are not tuned in order to approach diﬀerent properties.

First, we analyze a ﬁrst category of measures which include the features of traditional

interest when aiming to reproduce the Internet topology. The small world eﬀect becomes

clear when analyzing the distribution of the shortest path lengths, as seen in the left side

graph of Fig. 2, with an average shortest path length very close to the real one. The graph

on the right of Fig. 2 shows simulation results for the cumulative degree distribution, in

nice agreement to that measured for the AS+ map. The inset exhibits simulation results of

the AS’s degree as a function of the AS’s bandwidth, conﬁrming the scaling ansatz Eq. (7).

Clustering coeﬃcient and average nearest neighbors degree are showed in Fig. 3. Dashed

lines result from the model without distance constraints, whereas squares correspond to the

model with distance constraints. Interestingly, the high level of clustering coming out from

the model arises as a consequence of the pattern followed to attach nodes, so that only

those AS willing for new connections will link. As can be observed in the ﬁgures, distance

constraints introduce a disassortative component by inhibiting connections between small

ASs so that the hierarchical structure of the real network is better reproduced.

Now, we turn our attention to new measures, which run from the scaling of higher orders

loops to the k-core structure. Not only two-point correlations are well approximated by our

model, but it is also able to reproduce the scaling behavior of the number of loops of size 3, 4

and 5. This has been recently measured for the Internet at the AS level in [19], and it is seen

to follow a power of the system size of the form Nh(N) ∼ N ξ(h), with exponents that are

closely reproduced by our synthetic networks, see Fig. 4 and table I.

In Fig. 5, we observe

on the left the cumulative distribution of betweenness centrality as proposed by Freeman

[27], a measure of the varying importance of the vertices in a network. On the right, the

cumulative distribution of triangles passing by a node (for a discussion of the relevance of

P(T) see, for instance, [28]).

Finally, we also show the k-core decomposition of the actual and the synthetic maps.

The k-core decomposition is a recursive reduction of the network as a function of the degree,

which allows the recognition of hierarchical structure and more central nodes [20]. A very

good agreement between real measures and our models can be appreciated in Fig.6.

In

the case of the model with distance constraints, even the coreness, the maximum number

of layers in the k-core decomposition, is almost the same as in the Internet map. These

visualizations have been produced with the tool LANET-VI [21].

V. CONCLUSIONS

In summary, we have presented a simple weighted growing network model for the Internet,

based on evolution, environmental interaction and heterogeneity. The dynamics is driven

by two key mechanisms, competition and adaptation, which may be relevant in other self-

organizing systems. Beyond technical details, many empirical features are nicely reproduced

but open questions remain, perhaps the more important one being whether the general ideas

and mechanisms exposed in this work could help us to better understand other complex

systems.

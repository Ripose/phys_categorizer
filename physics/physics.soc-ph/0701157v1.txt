Abstract. We present a model for growing information networks where the ageing of
a node depends on the time at which it entered the network and on the last time it was
cited. The model is shown to undergo a transition from a small-world to large-world
network. The degree distribution may exhibit very diﬀerent shapes depending on the
model parameters, e.g. delta-peaked, exponential or power-law tailed distributions.

Activity ageing in growing networks

1. Introduction

The ageing of nodes is an important process in order to understand the way information
or social networks grow [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. For instance, this process may be responsible for
deviations to scale-free degree distributions [1] or for the non-vanishing values of the
clustering coeﬃcient observed in many networks [6, 7, 8]. Ageing accounts for the fact
that old nodes lose their ability to acquire new links as time goes on, thereby limiting
the number of active nodes to a small fraction of the whole network. In general, this
eﬀect embodies the notion of generation for social agents, the lifetime of an information
or of an article, etc... Such eﬀects may be taken into account by attributing an age τ to
nodes [2] and by assuming that their probability to receive a link from a newly entering
node depends on their age (through some decreasing function of τ ) and, possibly, on
other parameters such as their degree k (preferential attachment [9, 10]). An alternative
model [6, 7, 8] assumes that nodes can be deactivated with a probability proportional to
k−1. In this deactivation model (DM), once a node is deactivated, it is excluded from the
network dynamics. DM is appealing because it mimics the fact that less popular nodes
are more easily forgotten than the popular ones. This is the case for citation networks
[12] (e.g. nodes are the articles and directed links are the citations of one article by
another one), for instance, where highly cited papers usually continue to be cited for a
long time, and vice versa. E.g. papers with more than 100 citations have an average
citation age of 11.7 years while the publications with more than 1000 citations have
average citation age of 18.9 years [12]. Unfortunately, DM is unsatisfactory because the
underlying mechanism for this deactivation probability ∼ k−1 is not identiﬁed and a
more fundamental model is therefore of interest.

A similar lack of clarity also occurs when one tries to justify linear preferential
attachment models [9, 11]. Indeed, the latter imply that entering nodes have a global
knowledge of the network, i.e. they must be aware of the degrees of every previously
existing nodes before connecting to one of them. This unrealistic approach can be
elegantly circumvented by introducing redirection [13, 14] or copying [15, 16, 17, 18]
mechanisms. In the simplest version, that one explains in terms of citation networks for
the sake of clarity, an author who is writing the reference list for a new paper picks a
random pre-existing paper. Then the author cites either the randomly selected paper
(with probability 1 − r) or one of the references within that paper (with probability r).
It is straightforward to show that this purely local process generates linear preferential
In this Article, we proceed along the same line of thought and

introduce a model, called Link Activation Model (LAM), that includes ageing eﬀects.
Its interpretation is quite natural for information networks, such as citation networks.
The system is a growing network where, for the sake of simplicity, entering nodes have
only one outgoing link (each paper cites one other paper). One assumes that only
recent nodes are active but, contrary to previous models, a node is active if it has been
introduced recently or if its has been cited recently. In detail, when an author cites a
paper, it either selects the latest paper (the paper entered at the previous time step)

Figure 1. Four possible conﬁgurations when a new node enters the network. The
latest node is darkened and the entering node is in white. With probability p(1 − r),
the latest node receives the link from the entering node. With probability pr, the
latest node is selected, but redirection takes place, so that the father of the latest
node receives the link from the entering node. The two other possible conﬁgurations,
associated to the random selection of a node (in this example, node 2), occur with
probabilities (1 − p)(1 − r) and (1 − p)r.

with probability p or a random paper with probability 1 − p. Then, with probability
r, the author cites the paper cited by the selected paper. With probability 1 − r, he
cites the selected paper. The model therefore depends on two parameters p and r that
measure the importance of ageing and redirection processes as compared to random
eﬀects. There are four diﬀerent possibilities that can take place at each time step,
as summarized in Fig.1. An applet allowing the dynamical visualisation of the model
should also available online [19]. Let us stress that the ingredients of the model are
very general and that LAM is not limited to citation networks, but should also apply
to other information networks, e.g. the Web.

Before going further, let us precise notations.

Initially (t = 0), the network is
composed of one node, the seed. For the sake of coherence, the seed has an outgoing link
connected to itself. At each time step t, a new node enters the network. Consequently,
the total number of nodes is equal to Nt = 1 + t, and the number of links is also
Lt = 1 + t.

2. Height distribution

In this section, we focus on the height distribution, the height of a node [20] being
deﬁned to be the length of the shortest path between this node and the seed. Let us
note Ng;t the average number of nodes at the height g. By construction, N0;t = 1 for all
times. We also deﬁne lg;t to be the probability that the latest node is at height g. It is
straightforward to show that these quantities satisfy the coupled rate equations

Ng;t+1 = Ng;t + (1 − p)

+ p[(1 − r)lg−1 + rlg]

lg;t+1 = (1 − p)

+ p[(1 − r)lg−1 + rlg],

except for g = 1:

N1;t+1 = N1;t + (1 − p)

+ p(l0;t + rl1;t)

N0;t + rN1;t

+ p(l0;t + rl1;t)

N0 + rN1;t

l1;t+1 = (1 − p)

and for g = 0 where one has the trivial solutions N0 = 1 and l0 = 0 (this is due to
the fact that an entering node can only arrive at height 1 or higher). The above rate
equations are derived in the usual way and generalise the equation with p = 0 found
It is straightforward to verify that Nt =
g Ng;t = t + 1 and
in [21] for instance.
g lg;t = 1.
lt =

P

Let us ﬁrst focus on the case p = 1, where only latest nodes are selected, and take a
P
continuous time limit (this is justiﬁed a posteriori as we are interested in the long time
behaviour of the model). In that case, one has to solve

∂tNg;t = (1 − r)lg−1 + rlg
∂tlg;t = (1 − r)lg−1 + (r − 1)lg.

In the following, we are interested in the behaviour of the average total height Gt =
∞
g=0 glg;t

∞
g=0 gNg;t. To do so, one also needs to evaluate the behaviour of the at =

P

that is easily found to satisfy
P

∂tat = (1 − r).

Consequently, ag asymptotically behaves like (1 − r)t and the equation for the total
height Gt reads

∂tGt = (1 − r) + (1 − r)t.

This equation leads to the asymptotic behaviour Gt = (1−r)
t2. This implies that the
average height gt ≡ Gt/(N + 1) ≃ Gt/t asymptotically increases linearly with time.
Moreover, the redirecting process slows down the growth of the network (see Fig.2).
This is expected as redirection favours the connection to nodes closer to the seed. In
the limiting case p = 1, where the process is easily shown to lead to a star network (i.e.
all the nodes are connected to the seed), one ﬁnds Gt = t ⇔ g = 1.

Figure 2. Typical realisations of the model when p = 1. In that case, the average
height evolves linearly with time and one observes a large range of behaviours, from a
aligned network (r = 0) to a star network (r = 1). The average height g increases in
a large-world way, i.e. linearly with time gt = (1−r)

It is easy to simplify Eq.8 into:

t∂tGt = (1 − r)t + (1 − p)Gt + p t at
t∂tat = (1 − r)t + (1 − p)Gt + (p − 1)t at.

Numerical integration of the above set of equations and our knowledge of the previous
simpliﬁed cases (e.g. Eq.5) suggest to look for solutions of the form Gt = Ct log(t),
at = C log(t) + K. By inserting these expressions into Eqs.9 and keeping leading terms

which cease to be valid when p = 1,
in agreement with the solution of Eq.5.
Consequently, the average height gt asymptotically grows logarithmically with time
1−p log(t). This result should be compared with the linear regime gt = (1−r)
gt = 1−r
t
taking place when p = 1. Let us stress that such a transition from a large-world (gt ∼ t)
to a small-world [22, 23] (gt ∼ log(t)) network has already been observed in another
model with ageing [8] and is associated with the cross-over from a structured network,
reminiscent of a one-dimensional line, to an unstructured network. The above solution
is in agreement with the prediction gt = (1 − r) log(t) taking place in a model without
ageing [21].

3. Degree distribution

Let us note by Nk;t the average number of nodes with k incoming links. For the sake of
clarity, we ﬁrst focus on three simpliﬁed cases, r = 0, p = 0 and p = 1 before deriving
results for general values of the parameters.

When r = 0, there is no possible redirection and the stochastic mechanism takes
place during the selection of a node. With probability p, the latest node, which has
by deﬁnition zero incoming links, receives the link of the entering node, while with
probability 1 − p, a random node receives this link. Consequently, the rate equation for
Nk;t [24] reads

∂tNk = (1 − p)

+ p(δk,1 − δk,0) + δk,0,

(11)

Nk−1 − Nk
N

where the last delta term accounts for the degree distribution of the newly entering node.
We look for a stationary solution of the distribution nk = Nk/N which is determined
by the recurrence relations

(1 − p)(nk−1 − nk) + p(δk,1 − δk,0) + δk,0 − nk = 0.

(12)

Its solution is easily found to be

n0 =

for k > 1.

When p = 0, one recovers the exponential solution nk = (1/2)k+1. For increasing
values of p, the tail of the distribution remains exponential, but its core is more and
more peaked around k = 1. In the limiting case p = 1, the solution goes to a peaked
distribution nk = δk1 that corresponds to an aligned network (see Fig.2).

In the case p = 0, LAM reduces to the usual model with redirection for which it is

well-known [13] that the degree distribution evolves as

∂tnk = r[(k − 1)nk−1 − knk] + (1 − r)(nk−1 − nk) + δk,0 − nk.

(14)

The stationary solution is therefore found by recurrence

(rk + 2 − r)nk = (rk + 1 − 2r)nk−1.

(15)
This stationary solution has a power-law tail k−ν whose exponent ν is obtained by
inserting the form nk ∼ k−ν into the above equation. By keeping the leading terms in
k−1, i.e. (k − 1)−ν = k−ν(1 − 1/k)−ν ≃ k−ν(1 + ν/k), one has to solve

(rk + 2 − r)k−ν = (rk + 1 − 2r)k−ν(1 + ν/k),

(16)

so that one recovers the value ν = 1+r

r derived in [13].
The case p = 1 is slightly more complicated, due to the fact that the selected node
is always the latest node. Consequently, one also has to focus on the quantity Ak that
is the average number of nodes with degree k that are cited by the latest node. By
k Ak = 1 (because there is only one latest node by
construction, this quantity satisﬁes
construction) and the system is described by the coupled set of equations
P

∂tNk = r(Ak−1 − Ak) + (1 − r)(δk,1 − δk,0) + δk,0
∂tAk = rAk−1 + (1 − r)δk,1 − Ak.

Let u note that the equations for Nk and Ak are quite similar, except for their loss term.
This is due to the fact that all nodes that do not receive a link at a time step are cited
by nodes that cease to be the latest node by construction. The stationary values of Ak

of the aligned network. Before going further, let us stress that LAM exhibits a very
rich phenomenology, with a degree distribution that can behave like a delta peak, an
exponential or a power-law depending on the parameters.

By putting together

the above limiting case,

+ p[r(Ak−1 − Ak) + (1 − r)(δk,1 − δk,0)] + δk,0 − nk

0 = (1 − p)[r(k − 1)nk−1 + (1 − r)nk−1]

+ p[rAk−1 + (1 − r)δk,1] − Ak.

It is possible to write the formal solution of the second relation:

(pr)i−1(1 − p)[r(k − i) + (1 − r)]nk−i.

(22)

After inserting this solution into the ﬁrst equation of Eqs.21, looking for a solution of the
form nk ∼ k−ν and keeping the leading terms in k−1, it is straightforward but lengthy
to get the expression

A0 = 0
Ak = (pr)k−1p(1 − r) +

This solution is well deﬁned when p 6= 1 and r 6= 0 and recovers the result derived
above when p = 0. It is important to note that the tail of the distribution behaves like
a power-law for any other value of the parameters. Let us also note that Eq.23 is a
monotonically increasing function of p, for ﬁxed values of r, so that ageing mechanisms
have a tendency to diminish the number of nodes with very high degrees. This can be
understood by noting that ageing diminishes the probability for old nodes to be cited,
while these old nodes are typically those with the highest degree.

4. Discussion

In this Article, we have presented a simple model for growing networks with ageing. This
Link Activated Model incorporates the fact that articles remain present in the collective
memory as long as they are cited or read. Namely, articles that are the most likely to be
cited are those that have been published recently or those that have been cited recently.
In other words, all sorts of articles that are present and may have punctually triggered
the reader’s curiosity. This natural process is shown to lead to a rich behaviour for
the network structure, that leads to a transition from a large-world to a small-world
network. Moreover, various kinds of asymptotic stationary degree distributions may
be reached depending on the model parameters: a delta peak that corresponds to a
one-dimensional lattice, exponential-like distributions or power-law tailed distributions.
Let us insist on the fact that LAM is quite general and should apply to many situations
involving a competition between multiplicative eﬀects (rich gets richer) and ageing.

In this paper, a directed network model for world-wide web is presented. The out-degree of the
added nodes are supposed to be scale-free and its mean value is m. This model exhibits small-world
eﬀect, which means the corresponding networks are of very short average distance and highly large
clustering coeﬃcient. More interesting, the in-degree distribution obeys the power-law form with
the exponent γ = 2 + 1/m, depending on the average out-degree. This ﬁnding is supported by the
empirical data, which has not been emphasized by the previous studies on directed networks.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The last few years have burst a tremendous activity de-
voted to the characterization and understanding of com-
plex network[1, 2, 3, 4]. Researchers described many
real-world systems as complex networks with nodes rep-
resenting individuals or organizations and edges mimick-
ing the interaction among them. Commonly cited ex-
amples include technological networks, information net-
works, social networks and biological networks [4]. The
results of many experiments and statistical analysis indi-
cate that the networks in various ﬁelds have some com-
mon characteristics. They have small average distances
like random graphs, large clustering coeﬃcients like reg-
ular networks, and power-law degree distributions. The
above characters are called the small-world eﬀect[5] and
scale-free property[6].

Motivated by the empirical studies on various real-
life networks, some novel network models were proposed
recently. The ﬁrst successful attempt to generate net-
works with high clustering coeﬃcient and small aver-
age distance is that of Watts and Strogatz (WS model)
[5]. The WS model starts with a ring lattice with N
nodes wherein every node is connected to its ﬁrst 2m
neighbors. The small-world eﬀect emerges by randomly
rewiring each edge of the lattice with probability p such
that self-connections and duplicate edges are excluded.
The rewiring edges are called long-range edges which con-
nect nodes that otherwise may be part of diﬀerent neigh-
borhoods. Recently, some authors have demonstrated
that the small-world eﬀect can also be produced by us-
ing deterministic methods[7, 8, 9].

Another signiﬁcant model capturing the scale-free
property is proposed by Barab´asi and Albert (BA net-
work) [6, 10]. Two special features, i.e., the growth and
preferential attachment, is investigated in the BA net-
works for the free scaling of the Internet, WWW and sci-

entiﬁc co-authorship networks, etc. These points to the
fact that many real-world networks continuously grow by
the way that new nodes added to the network, and would
like to connect to the existing nodes with large number
of neighbors.

While the BA model captures the basic mechanism
which is responsible for the power-law distribution, it is
still a minimal model with several limitations:
it only
predicts a ﬁxed exponent in a power-law degree distri-
bution, and the clustering coeﬃcients of BA networks
is very small and decrease with the increasing of net-
work size, following approximately C ∼ ln2N/N [11]. To
further understand various microscopic evolution mecha-
nisms and overcome the BA model’s discrepancies, there
have been several promising attempts. For example, the
aging eﬀect on nodes’ charms leads the studies on the
aging models[11, 12, 13, 14], the geometrical eﬀect
on the appearance probability of edges leads the stud-
ies on the networks in Euclidean space[15, 16, 17],
and the self-similar eﬀect on the existence of hierar-
chical structures leads the studies on the hierarchical
models[18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23].

One of the extensively studied networks is the World-
Wide Web[24, 25, 26, 27], which can be treated as a di-
rected network having power-law distributions for both
in-degree and out-degree. In addition, it is a small-world
networks. Since the knowledge of the evolution mecha-
nism is very important for the better understanding of
the dynamics built upon WWW, many theoretical mod-
els have been constructed previously[28, 29, 30]. How-
ever, these models haven’t considered the relationship
between the in-degree distribution and the out-degree
distribution.

In this paper, we propose a directed network model for
the World-Wide Web. This model displays both scale-
free and small-world properties, and its power-law expo-
nent of out-degree distribution is determined by the av-
erage in-degree. Comparisons among the empirical data,
analytic results and simulation results strongly suggest
the present model a valid one. The rest of this paper is
organized as follows: In section 2, the present model is

In section 3, the analyzes and simulations
on network properties are shown, including the degree
distribution, the average distance, and the clustering co-
eﬃcient. Finally, in section 4, the main conclusion is
drawn.

III. THE STATISTICAL CHARACTERISTICS

In this section, the scale-free small-world characteris-

tics of the present model are shown.

A. The Scale-free Property

The probability that a newly appearing node connects
to a previous node is simply proportional to the in-degree
k of the old vertex. Suppose the newly added node’s
attraction is A, then the probability of attachment to
the old vertices should be proportional to k + A, where
A is a constant and we set A = 1 for simplicity[32]. The
probability that a new edge attaches to any of the vertices
with degree k is

(k + 1)pk
k(k + 1)pk

=

(k + 1)pk
m + 1

.

P

The mean out-degree of the newly added node is simply
m, hence the mean number of new edges to vertices with
current in-degree k is (k+1)pkm/(m+1). Denote pk,n the
value of pk when the network size is n, then the change
of npk is

(n + 1)pk,n+1 − npk,n = m[kpk−1,n−(k+1)pk,n]
(n + 1)p0,n+1 − np0,n = 1 − p0,n

m+1
m
m+1

(

k ≥ 1

k = 0

The stationary condition pk,n+1 = pk,n = pk yields

pk =

[kpk−1 − (k + 1)pk]m/(m + 1), k ≥ 1;

(

1 − p0m/(m + 1),

k = 0.

II. THE MODEL

Rearranging, one gets

Our model starts with a connected graph of N0 nodes
and m0 edges. At each time step i, a new node vi is added
and 2ei existing nodes are chosen to be its neighbors. The
choosing procedure involves two processes: preferential
attachment[6] and neighboring attachment[31]. Firstly,
in the preferential attachment process, ei nodes, denoted
by the set Qi, are selected with probability proportional
to their in-degrees. And then, in the neighboring attach-
ment process, for each node x ∈ Qi, one of its neighbors
is randomly selected to connect to vi. Combine these two
processes, there are in total 2ei nodes having been cho-
sen as the new one’s neighbors. In the whole evolution
processes, the self-connections and duplicute edges are
excluded.

It should be emphasized that, since the out-degree of
the WWW network is not ﬁxed but approximately obey-
ing a power law, the number of newly added edges during
one time step, 2e, is not a constant but a random number
also obeying a power-law. And the average out-degree m
is ﬁxed, which signiﬁcantly aﬀects the in-degree distribu-
tion exponent, average distance and clustering coeﬃcient
of the whole network.

This yields

pk =

(

k

k+2+1/m pk−1,
(m + 1)/(2m + 1), k = 0.

k ≥ 1;

pk =

k(k−1)···1
(k+2+1/m)···(3+1/m) p0

= (1 + 1/m)B(k + 1, 2 + 1/m),

where B(a, b) = Γ(a)Γ(b)/Γ(a + b) is Legendre’s beta
function, which goes asymptotically as a−b for large a
and ﬁx b, hence

pk ∼ k−(2+1/m).

This leads to pk ∼ k−γi with γi = (2 + 1/m) for large N ,
where γi is the exponent of the in-degree degree distri-
bution.

In Fig. 1, the degree distributions for m = 1, 2, 3, 4 are
shown. The simulation results agree with the analytic
one very well and indicate that the exponents of the de-
gree distribution have no relationship to the network size
N .

FIG. 2: The average distance L vs network size N of the
undirected version of the present model. One can see that L
increases very slowly as N increases. The main plot exhibits
the curve where L is considered as a function of lnN , which
is well ﬁtted by a straight line. When m = 1, the curve is
above the ﬁtting line when N ≤ 3000 and under the line when
N ≥ 4000. When m = 2, 3, 4, the curve is under the line when
N ≥ 200, which indicates that the increasing tendency of L
is approximately to lnN , and in fact a little slower than lnN .

One of the signiﬁcant empirical results on the in- and
out-degree distributions is reported by Albert, Jeong and
Barab´asi [33]. In this paper the crawl from Altavista was
used. The appearance of the WWW from the point of
view of Altavista is as following [3]:

• In May 1999 the Web consisted of 203×106 vertices
and 1466×106 hyperlinks. The average in- and out-
degree were kin = kout = 7.22.

• In October 1999 there were already 271×106 ver-
tices and 2130×106 hyperlinks. The average in- and
out-degree were kin = kout = 7.85.

The distributions were found to be of a power-law form
with exponent γi = 2.1 and γo = 2.7, where γo is the
exponent of the out-degree degree distribution. When
kout = 7.22 and 7.85, one can obtained from γi = 2+1/m
that γi = 2.138 and 2.127 respectively, which is very close
to 2.1, thus give a strong support to the validity of the
present model.

B. The Average Distance

The average distance plays a signiﬁcant role in mea-
suring the transmission delay, thus is one of the most
important parameters to measure the eﬃciency of com-
munication network. Since the original conception of
small-world eﬀect is deﬁned based on undirected net-
works, hereinafter we only consider the undirected ver-
sion of our model, that is, the directed edge Eij from

3

(7)

(8)

node i to j is considered to be an bidirectional edge be-
tween node i and j. When the node is added to the net-
work, each node of the network according to the time is
marked. Denote d(i, j) the distance between nodes i and
j, the average distance with network size N is deﬁned as

L(N ) =

2σ(N )
N (N − 1)

,

where the total distance is:

σ(N ) =

d(i, j).

X1≤i<j≤N
Clearly, the distance between the existing nodes will not
increase with the network size N , thus we have

σ(N + 1) ≤ σ(N ) +

d(i, N + 1).

(9)

N

i=1
X

Denote y = {y1, y2, · · · , yl} as the node set that the (N +
1)th node have connected. The distance d(i, N + 1) can
be expressed as following

d(i, N + 1) = min{d(i, yj)|j = 1, 2, · · · , l} + 1.

(10)

Combining the results above, we have

σ(N + 1) ≤ σ(N ) + (N − l) +

D(i, y),

(11)

XΛ

where Λ = {1, 2, · · · , N } − {y1, y2, · · · , yl} is a node set
with cardinality N −l. Consider the set y as a single node,
then the sum
i=Λ d(i, y) can be treated as the distance
i=Λ d(i, y)
from all the nodes in Λ to y, thus the sum
can be expressed approximately in terms of L(N − l)

P

d(i, y) ≈ (N − l)L(N − l).

(12)

P

Xi=Λ

Because
monotonously with N , this yields

the

distance L(N )

increases

(N −l)L(N −l) = (N −l)

2σ(N − l)
(N − l)(N − l − 1)

<

2σ(N )
N − l − 1
(13)

.

Then we can obtain the inequality

σ(N + 1) < σ(N ) + (N − l) +

(14)

2σ(N )
N − l − 1

.

Enlarge σ(N ), then the upper bound of the increasing
tendency of σ(N ) will be obtained by the following equa-
tion.

.

(15)

= N − l +

2σ(N )
N − l − 1

dσ(N )
dN
This leads to the following solution:
σ(N ) = (N −l−1)2log(N −l−1)−(N −l−1)+C1(N −l−1).
(16)
From Eq.(7), we have that σ(N ) ∼ N 2L(N ), thus
L(N ) ∼ lnN . Since Eq.(14) is an inequality, the precise
increasing tendency of the average distance L(N ) may
be a little slower than lnN . The simulation results are
reported in ﬁgure 2.

where kin denotes the in-degree of the ith node. Because
the average out-degree is m, one can replace the out-
degree of each node by m. From Fig. 3, one can get
that the degree distribution of the undirected network is
p(k) ∼ k−3, where k = kmin, kmin + 1, · · · , kmax. As an
example, the clustering coeﬃcient C when m = 1 can be
rewritten as

FIG. 3: Degree distribution of the undirected versions of
the present model. At each time step, the new node se-
lects m = 1, 2, 3, 4 edges to connected, respectively. When
m = 1, 2, 3, 4, the power-law exponent γ of the density func-
tions are γ1,80000 = 2.95 ± 0.06, γ2,80000 = 2.97 ± 0.05,
γ3,80000 = 2.96 ± 0.07 and γ4,80000 = 2.96 ± 0.06, respectively.
The dash line have slope -3.0 for comparison.

where

is the local clustering coeﬃcient of node i, and E(i) is
the number of edges among the neighboring set of node i.
Approximately, when the node i is added to the network,
it is of degree 2ei and E(i) ≈ ei if the network is sparse
enough. And under the sparse case, if a new node is
added as i’s neighbor, E(i) will increase by 1. Therefore,
in terms of ki the expression of E(i) can be written as
following:

E(i) = ei + (ki − 2ei) = ki − ei.

(18)

Hence, we have

Ci =

2(ki − ei)
ki(ki − 1)

.

(19)

This expression indicates that the local clustering scales
as C(k) ∼ k−1.
It is interesting that a similar scaling
has been observed in pseudofractal web [19] and several
real-life networks [18]. In ﬁgure 4, we report the simu-
lation result about the relationship between C(k) and k,
which is in good accordance with both the analytic and
empirical data [18].

Consequently, we have

It can be obtained that c1 = 4.9491 and C = 2 ×

4.9491 ×
hibits that most real-life networks have large clustering
coeﬃcients no matter how many nodes they have. From
Fig. 5, one can get that as the average out-degree in-
creases, the clustering coeﬃcient decreases dramatically,
which indicates that the clustering coeﬃcient C is rele-
vant to the average out-degree m.

both of very large clustering coeﬃcient and very small
average distance. We argue that the degree distribution
of many real-life directed networks may be ﬁtted appro-
priately by two power-law distributions, i.e., in- and out-
degree power-law distributions, such as the citation net-
work, Internet network and World-Wide Web. Both the
analytic and numerical studies indicate the exponent of
the in-degree distribution of the presented networks can
be well ﬁtted by 2 + 1/m, which has been observed in
the empirical data. Although this model is simple and
rough, it oﬀers a good starting point to explain the exist-
ing empirical data and the relationship between the in-
and out-degree distribution exponents.

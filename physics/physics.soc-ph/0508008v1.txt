We derive mean-ﬁeld equations that describe the dynamics of a general model of rumor spreading
on complex networks, and use analytical and numerical solutions of these equations to examine the
threshold behavior and dynamics of the model on random graphs, uncorrelated scale-free networks
and scale-free networks with assortative degree correlations. We show that in both homogeneous
networks and random graphs the model exhibits a critical threshold in the rumor spreading rate
below which a rumor cannot propagate in the system. In the case of scale-free networks, on the other
hand, this threshold becomes vanishingly small in the limit of inﬁnite system size. We ﬁnd that the
initial rate at which a rumor spreads is much higher in scale-free networks than in random graphs,
and that the rate at which the spreading proceeds on scale-free networks is further increased when
assortative degree correlations are introduced. The impact of degree correlations on the ﬁnal fraction
of nodes that ever hears a rumor, however, depends on the interplay between network topology and
the rumor spreading rate. Our results show that scale-free networks are prone to the spreading of
rumors, just as they are to the spreading of infections. They are relevant to the spreading dynamics
of chain emails, viral advertising and large-scale data dissemination algorithms on the Internet, the
so-called gossip protocols.

INTRODUCTION

Many real-life technological, social and biological sys-
tems have complex network-like structures, where ver-
tices represent entities comprising the systems and edges
the presence of some form of interaction or relationship
between them. Some important examples include the
Internet [1, 2], the World Wide Web [3], and social inter-
action networks [4, 5, 6, 7]. In recent years a signiﬁcant
amount of research has been devoted to empirical and
theoretical studies of such networks [8, 9, 10].

A large body of this work has been focused on ﬁnding
statistical properties, such as degree distributions, aver-
age shortest paths, and clustering coeﬃcients that char-
acterize the structure of complex networks. Another ac-
tive area of research is on creating realistic models of such
networks which can help us better understand the un-
derlying organization mechanisms behind their formation
and evolution. A third area of research, which is still at
its early stages, investigates dynamical processes on com-
plex networks with the aim of understanding the impact
of network topology on the dynamics [11, 12, 13, 14, 15].
A prominent example of such process is the spreading
of rumors in social networks [16, 17, 18]. Rumors bear an
immediate resemblance with epidemics and their spread-
ing plays an important role in a variety of human aﬀairs,
such as stock markets [19], politics and warfare. Rumor-
like mechanisms also form the basis for the phenomena

of viral marketing, where companies exploit social net-
works of their customers on the Internet in order to pro-
mote their products via the so-called ‘word-of-email’ and
‘word-of-web’ [20, 21]. Finally, rumor-mongering forms
the basis for an important class of communication proto-
cols, called gossip algorithms, which are used for large-
scale information dissemination on the Internet, and in
peer-to-peer ﬁle sharing applications [22, 23].

Unlike epidemic spreading which has been extensively
studied, quantitative models and investigations of rumor
dynamics have been rather limited. Furthermore, most
existing models either do not take into account the topol-
ogy of the underlying social interaction networks along
which rumors spread, or use highly simpliﬁed models of
the topology. While such simple models may adequately
describe the spreading process in small-scale social net-
works, via the word-of-mouth, they become highly inad-
equate when applied to the spreading of rumors in large
social interaction networks, in particular those which are
formed on the Web. Such networks, which include email
networks [24], and social networking sites [7], typically
number in tens of thousands to millions of nodes and their
topology can show highly complex connectivity patterns
[7, 24].

In two previous papers [15, 25] we investigated the
dynamics of a classical model of rumor spreading, the
so-called Daley-Kendall model [17], on such networks.
In this paper we describe a more general model of ru-

mor dynamics on networks, which uniﬁes our previ-
ous model with the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR)
model of epidemics. We formulate the dynamics of
this model within the framework of Interacting Markov
Chains (IMC) [26], and use this framework to derive
a set of equations that describe on a mean-ﬁeld level
the dynamics of the model on complex Markovian net-
works. Using analytical and numerical solutions of these
equations we examine both the steady-state and the
time-dependent behavior of the model on Erd˝os-R´eyni
(ER) random graphs, as a prototypical example of ho-
mogeneous networks, and strongly heterogenous scale-
free (SF) networks, both in the absence and presence of
assortative degree correlations.

Our results point out to several important diﬀerences
in the dynamics of rumor spreading on the above net-
works. In particular, we ﬁnd the presence of a critical
value for the rumor spreading rate (a rumor threshold)
below which rumors cannot spread in random graphs,
and its absence in scale-free networks with unbounded
ﬂuctuations in node degree distribution. We ﬁnd that
the initial spreading rate of a rumor is much higher on
scale-free networks as compared to random graphs, and
that this spreading rate is further increased when assor-
tative degree-degree correlations are introduced. The ﬁ-
nal fraction of nodes which ever hears a rumor (we call
this the ﬁnal size of a rumor), however, depends on the
interplay between the model parameters and the under-
lying topology. Our ﬁndings provide a better quantita-
tive understanding of the complex interplay between the
characteristics of a rumor, i.e.
its spreading and cessa-
tion rates, and the topology of the underlying interaction
network that supports its propagation. They are rele-
vant to a number of rumor-like processes such as chain
emails, viral advertising and large-scale data dissemina-
tion in computer and communication networks via gossip
protocols.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Sec-
tion II we describe our general rumor model. In section
III a formulation of the model within the framework of
Interactive Markov Chains is given, and the correspond-
ing mean-ﬁeld equations are derived. In section IV ana-
lytical results are presented for the case of homogeneous
networks, characterized by a constant degree and no de-
gree correlations. This is followed by a numerical study
of the model on ER random graphs and both uncorre-
lated and assortatively correlated SF networks. We close
this paper in section V with conclusions.

II. A GENERAL RUMOR MODEL ON
NETWORKS

The model we shall consider is deﬁned in the follow-
ing way. A closed population consisting of N members is
subdivided into three groups, those who have not heard
the rumor, those who have heard it and wish to spread
it, and those who have heard it but have ceased com-

2

municating it. We call these groups ignorants, spreaders
and stiﬂers, respectively. The rumor spreads by directed
contact of the spreaders with others in the population,
which takes place along the links of an undirected social
interaction network G = (V, E), where V and E denote
the vertices and the edges of the network, respectively.
The outcome of contact of a speciﬁed spreader with (a)
an ignorant is that the ignorant becomes an spreader at
a rate λ, and (b) another spreader or a stiﬂer is that
the initiating spreader becomes stiﬂer at a rate α. The
spreading process starts with one (or more) element(s)
becoming informed of a rumor and terminates when no
spreaders are left in the population. In the Daley-Kendall
rumor model and its variants stiﬂing is the only mech-
anism that results in cessation of rumor spreading. In
reality, however, cessation can occur also purely as a re-
sult of spreaders forgetting to tell the rumor, or their
disinclination to spread the rumor anymore. Following
a suggestion in [16], we take this important mechanism
into account by assuming that individuals may also cease
spreading a rumor spontaneously (i.e. without the need
for any contact) at a rate δ.

III.

INTERACTIVE MARKOV CHAIN
MEAN-FIELD EQUATIONS

We can describe the dynamics of the above model on a
network within the framework of the Interactive Markov
Chains (IMC). The IMC was originally introduced in
mathematical sociology, as a means for modeling social
processes involving many interacting actors (or agents)
[26]. More recently they have been applied to the dynam-
ics of cascading failures in electrical power networks [27],
and the spread of malicious software (malware) on the
Internet [28]. An IMC consists of N interacting nodes,
with each node having a state that evolves in time ac-
cording to an internal Markov chain. Unlike conventional
Markov chains, however, the corresponding internal tran-
sition probabilities depend not only on the current state
of a node itself, but also on the states of all the nodes to
which it is connected. The overall system evolves accord-
ing to a global Markov Chain whose state space dimen-
sion is the product of states describing each node. When
dealing with large networks, the exponential growth in
the state space renders direct numerical solution of the
IMCs extremely diﬃcult, and one has to resort to either
Monte Carlo simulations or approximate solutions.
In
the case of rumor model, each internal Markov chain can
be in one of the three states: ignorant, spreader or stiﬂer.
For this case we derive below a set of coupled rate equa-
tions which describe on a mean-ﬁeld level the dynamics
of the IMC. We note that a similar mean-ﬁeld approach
may also be applicable to other dynamical processes on
networks which can be described within the IMC frame-
work.

Consider now a node j which is in the ignorant state at
ii the probability that this node

time t. We denote with pj

3

(8)

stays in the ignorant state in the time interval [t, t + ∆t],
and with pj
ii the probability that it makes a
transition to the spreader state. It then follows that

is = 1 − pj

pj
ii = (1 − ∆tλ)g,

(1)

where g = g(t) denotes the number of neighbors of node
j which are in the spreader state at time t. In order to
progress, we shall coarse-grain the micro-dynamics of the
system by classifying nodes in our network according to
their degree and taking statistical average of the above
transition probability over degree classes.

Assuming that a node j has k links, g can be considered
as an stochastic variable which has the following binomial
distribution:

The above transition probabilities can be used to set
up a system of coupled stochastic equations for change in
time of the population of ignorants, spreaders and stiﬂers
within each connectivity class [30]. However, ignoring
ﬂuctuations around expected values we can also obtain a
set of deterministic rate equations for the expected values
of these quantities. In the limit ∆t → 0 these equations
are given by

where θ(k, t) is the probability at time t that an edge

θ(k, t) =

P (k′|k)P (sk′ |ik) ≈

P (k′|k)ρs(k′, t).

In this equation P (k′|k) is the degree-degree correla-
tion function, P (sk′ |ik) the conditional probability that
a node with k′ links is in the spreader state, given that
it is connected to an ignorant node with degree k, and
ρs(k′, t) is the density of spreader nodes at time t which
belong to connectivity class k.
In the above equation
the ﬁnal approximation is obtained by ignoring dynamic
correlations between the states of neighboring nodes.

The transition probability ¯pii(k, t) averaged over all

possible values of g is then given by:

¯pii(k, t) =

(1 − λ∆t)gθ(k, t)g(1 − θ(k, t))k−g

In the above equations ρi(k, t), ρs(k, t), and ρr(k, t) are
the densities at time t of, respectively, ignorants, spread-
ers and stiﬂers in class k. These quantities satisfy the
normalization condition ρi(k, t) + ρs(k, t) + ρr(k, t) = 1.
For future reference we note here that information on
the underlying network is incorporated in the above equa-
tions solely via the degree-degree correlation function.
Thus in our analytical and numerical studies reported in
the next section we do not need to generate any actual
network. All that is required is either an analytical ex-
pression for P (k′|k) or a numerical representation of this
quantity.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

A. Homogeneous networks

In a similar fashion we can derive an expression for
the probability ¯pss(k, t) that a spreader node which
has k links stays in this state in the interval [t, t + ∆t].
In this case, however, we also need to compute the
expected value of the number of stiﬂer neighbors of the
node at time t. Following steps similar to the previous
paragraphs we obtain

¯pss(k, t) =

1 − α∆t

P (k′|k)(ρs(k′, t) + ρr(k′, t))

 

k′
X

× (1 − δ∆t).

In order to understand some basic features of our ru-
mor model we ﬁrst consider the case of homogeneous net-
works, in which degree ﬂuctuations are very small and
there are no degree correlations. In this case the rumor
equations become:

dρi(t)
dt
dρs(t)
dt

dρr(t)
dt

= −λ¯kρi(t)ρs(t)

= λ¯kρi(t)ρs(t) − α¯kρs(t)(ρs(t) + ρr(t))

− δρs(t)

= α¯kρs(t)(ρs(t) + ρr(t)) + δρs(t),

(5)

The corresponding probability for a transition from
the spreader to the stiﬂer state, ¯psr(k, t) is given by
¯psr(k, t) = 1 − ¯pss(k, t).

where ¯k denotes the constant degree distribution of the
network (or the average value for networks in which the

probability of ﬁnding a node with a diﬀerent connectivity
decays exponentially fast).

The above system of equations can be integrated ana-
lytically using an standard approach. In the inﬁnite time
limit, when s(∞) = 0, we obtain the following transcen-
dal equation for R = r(∞), the ﬁnal fraction of nodes
which ever hear the rumor (we call this the ﬁnal rumor
size)

where

Eq. (12) admits a non-zero solution only if ǫ > 1. For
δ 6= 0 this condition is fulﬁlled provided

which is precisely the same threshold condition as found
in the SIR model of epidemic spreading on homogeneous
networks [12, 29]. On the other hand, in the special
case δ = 0 (i.e when the forgetting mechanism is absent)
ǫ = 1 + λ/α > 1, and so Eq. (14) always admits a non-
zero solution, in agreement with the result in [25].

The above result shows, however, that the presence of
a forgetting mechanism results in the appearance of a ﬁ-
nite threshold in the rumor spreading rate below which
rumors cannot spread in homogeneous networks. Fur-
thermore, the value of the threshold is independent of α
(i.e. the stiﬂing mechanism), and is the same as that for
the SIR model of epidemics on such networks. This result
can be understood by noting that in the above equations
the terms corresponding to the stiﬂing mechanism are of
second order in ρs, while the terms corresponding to the
forgetting mechanism are only of ﬁrst order in this quan-
tity. Thus in the initial state of spreading process, where
ρs ≈ 0 and ρr ≈ 0, the eﬀect of stiﬂing is negligible rela-
tive to that of forgetting, and the dynamics of the model
reduces to that of the SIR model.

B. Random graphs and uncorrelated scale-free
networks

Next we numerically investigate the dynamics of rumor
spreading on complex networks. We consider ﬁrst uncor-
related networks, for which the degree-degree correlations
can be written as

P (k′|k) = q(k′) =

(15)

k′P (k′)
hki

,

where P (k′) is the degree distribution and hki is the av-
erage degree. We consider here two classes of such net-
works. The ﬁrst class is the Erd˝os-R´enyi random net-
works, which for large N have a Poisson degree distribu-
tion:

4

The above degree distribution peaks at an average value
hki and show small ﬂuctuations around this value. The
second class we consider are scale-free networks which are
characterized by a highly right-skewed power law degree
distribution:

P (k) =

Ak−γ
0

(

kmin ≤ k
otherwise.

(17)

In the above equation kmin is the minimum degree of
the networks and A is a normalization constant. For
2 ≤ γ ≤ 3 the variance of the above degree distribution
becomes inﬁnite in the limit of inﬁnite system size while
the average degree distribution remains ﬁnite. We shall
consider henceforth SF networks with γ = 3.

Our studies of uncorrelated networks were performed
using the above forms of P (k) to represent ER and SF
networks, respectively. The size of the networks consid-
ered was N = 105 N = 106, and the average degree
was ﬁxed at hki = 7. For each network considered we
generated a sequence of N random integers distributed
according to its degree distribution. The coupled set of
diﬀerential equation (6-8) were then solved numerically
using an standard ﬁnite diﬀerence scheme, and numerical
convergence with respect to the step size was checked nu-
merically. In the following and throughout the paper all
calculations reported are performed by starting the ru-
mor from a randomly chosen initial spreader, and averag-
ing the results over 300 runs with diﬀerent initial spread-
ers. The calculations reported below were performed for
networks consisting of N = 106 nodes.

In our ﬁrst set of calculations we set δ = 1 and investi-
gate the dynamics as a function of the rumor spreading
rate λ and the stiﬂing rate α. First we focus on the im-
pact of network topology on the ﬁnal size of a rumor, R,
which for inhomogeneous networks is obtained from

R =

ρr(k, t∞),

(18)

k
X

where t∞ denotes a suﬃciently long time at which the
spreading process has reached its steady state (i.e. no
In Fig. 1 R corre-
spreaders are left in the network).
sponding to the ER network is plotted as a function of
λ, and for several diﬀerent values of the stiﬂing param-
eter α. It can be seen that in this network R exhibits a
critical threshold λc below which a rumor cannot spread
in the network. Furthermore, just as in the case of ho-
mogeneous networks, the value of the threshold does not
depend on α, and is at λc = 0.12507. This value is in ex-
cellent agreement with the analytical results for the SIR
model on an inﬁnite size ER network, which is given by
λc = hki/hk2i = 0.125 [12]. We also veriﬁed numerically
that the behavior of R in the vicinity of the critical point
can be described with the form

R ∼ A(λ − λc)β,

(19)

P (k) = e−k hkik
k!

.

(16)

where β = 1, and A = A(α) is a smooth and monotoni-
cally decreasing function of α. The results are shown in

Fig. 2 where R is plotted as function of λ for a range of
values of α, together with the corresponding ﬁts.

We further examined the above numerical ﬁndings by
analytically solving Eqs. (6-8) in the vicinity of the crit-
ical rumor threshold, to ﬁrst order in α. Details of the
calculations are given in the Appendix, and they conﬁrm
the above numerical results for λc, and the behavior of
R in the vicinity of the critical rumor threshold.

Next we turn to our results for the SF network. In Fig.
3 results for R in this network are shown. In this case
we also observe the presence of an α-independent rumor
threshold, albeit for much smaller spreading rates than
for the ER network. We have veriﬁed numerically that
in this case the threshold is approached with zero slope,
as can also be gleaned from Fig. 3. Since the value of the
threshold is independent of α, we can use the well-known
result for the SIR model (the α = 0 case) to conclude
that in the limit of inﬁnite system size the threshold seen
in the SF network will approach zero. It is therefore not
an intrinsic property of rumor spreading on this network.
In order to further analyze the behavior of R in SF
networks, we have numerically ﬁtted our results to the
stretched exponential form,

R ∼ exp(−C/λ),

(20)

with C depending only weakly on α. This form was found
to describe the epidemic prevalence in both the SIS and
the SIR model of epidemics [11, 12]. The results are
displayed in Fig. 4, and they clearly indicate that the
stretched exponential form also nicely describes the be-
havior of R in our rumor model. This result provides
further support for our conjecture that the general ru-
mor model does not exhibit any threshold behavior on
SF networks (at least in the limit of inﬁnite systems size).

topology on the steady-state properties of the model, it is

of great interest to understand how the time-dependent
behavior of the model is aﬀected by topology. In Figs. 5
and 6 we display, as representative examples, time evo-
lution of, respectively, the total fractions of stiﬂers and
spreaders, in both networks for λ = 1 and two sets of
values of the cessation parameters: {δ = 1, α = 0}, and
{δ = 0, α = 1}. The ﬁrst set of parameters corresponds
to a spreading process in which cessation results purely
from spontaneous forgetting of a rumor by spreaders, or
their disinclination to spread the rumor any further. The
second set corresponds to a scenario where individuals
keep spreading the rumor until they become stiﬂers due
to their contacts with other spreaders or stiﬂers in the
network. As can be seen in Fig. 5, in the ﬁrst scenario
the initial spreading rate of a rumor on the SF network
is much faster than on the ER network. In fact, we ﬁnd

FIG. 4: R (in log scale) in the SF network of size 106 is
plotted as a function of 1/λ and several values of α. Solid
lines are our numerical ﬁts to the stretched exponential form
R = B(α) exp(−C(α)/λ). The network size is N = 106

that the time required for the rumor to reach 50% of
nodes in the ER random graph is nearly twice as long as
the corresponding time on the SF networks. This large
diﬀerence in the spreading rate is due to the presence of
highly connected nodes (hubs) in the SF network, whose
presence greatly speeds up the spreading of a rumor. We
note that in this scenario not only a rumor spreads ini-
tially faster on SF networks, but it also reaches a higher
fraction of nodes at the end of the spreading process.

It can be seen from Figs, 5 and 6 that in the second
spreading scenario (i.e. when stiﬂing is the only mecha-
nism for cessation) the initial spreading rate on the SF
network is, once again, higher than on the ER network.
However, unlike the previous situation, the ultimate size
of the rumor is higher on the ER network. This behavior
is due to the conﬂicting roles that hubs play when the
stiﬂing mechanism is switched on. Initially the presence
of hubs speeds up the spreading but once they turn into
stiﬂers they also eﬀectively impede further spreading of
the rumor.

are shown for two sets of values of the cessation parameters

C. Assortatively correlated scale-free networks

Recent studies have revealed that social networks dis-
play assortative degree correlations, implying that highly
connected vertices preferably connect to vertices which
are also highly connected [10]. In order to study the im-
pact of such correlations on the dynamics of our model,
we make use of the following “local” ansatz for the
degree-degree correlation function

P (k′|k) = (1 − β)q(k′) + βδkk′ ;

(0 ≤ β < 1).

(21)

This form has been used previously in recent studies of
the SIR dynamics on correlated scale-free networks [31,

32], and allows us to study in a controlled way the impact
of degree correlations on the spreading of rumor.

Using the above degree-degree correlation function we
numerically solved Eqs. (6-8) for a SF network charac-
terized by γ = 3 and < k >= 7. The network size was
ﬁxed at N = 100, 000, and we used two values for the
correlation parameter: β = 0.2 and β = 0.4. Fig. 7 dis-
plays R as a function of λ, and for α = 0.5, 0.75, 1 (the
value of δ was ﬁxed at 1).

It can be seen that below λ ≈ 0.5 a rumor will reach a
somewhat smaller fraction of nodes on the correlated net-
works than on the uncorrelated ones. However for larger
values of λ this behavior reverses, and the ﬁnal size of
the rumor in assortatively correlated networks shows a

higher value than in the uncorrelated network. We thus
conclude that the qualitative impact of degree correla-
tions on the ﬁnal size of a rumor depends very much
on the rumor spreading rate. We also investigated the
eﬀect of assortative correlations on the dynamics (tem-
poral behavior) of rumor spreading and found that such
correlations slightly increase the initial rate of spreading.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we introduced a general model of rumor
spreading on complex networks. Unlike previous rumor
models, our model incorporates two distinct mechanisms
that cause cessation of a rumor, stiﬂing and forgetting.
We used an Interactive Markov Chain formulation of the
model to derive deterministic mean-ﬁeld equations for
the dynamics of the model on Markovian complex net-
works. Using these equations we investigated analytically
and numerically the behavior of the model on Erd˝os-
R´enyi random graphs and scale-free networks with ex-
ponent γ = 3.

Our results show the presence of a critical threshold
in the rumor spreading rate below which a rumor can-
not spread in ER networks. The value of this threshold
was found to be independent of the stiﬂing mechanism,
and to be the same as the critical infection rate of the
SIR epidemic model. Such a threshold is also present in
the ﬁnite-size SF networks we studied, albeit at a much
smaller value. However in SF networks this threshold
is reached with a zero slope and its value becomes van-
ishingly small in the limit of inﬁnite network size. We
also found the initial rate of spreading of a rumor to be
much higher on scale-free networks than on ER random

graphs. An eﬀect which is caused by the presence of hubs
in these networks, which eﬃciently disseminate a rumor
once they become informed. Our results show that SF
networks are prone to the spreading of rumors, just as
they are to the spreading of infections.

Finally we used a local ansatz for the degree-degree
correlation function in order to numerically investigate
the impact of assortative degree correlations on the dy-
namics of our model on SF networks. These correlations
were found to increase slightly the initial rate of spread-
ing in SF networks. However, their impact on the ﬁnal
fraction of nodes which hear a rumor depends very much
on the rate of rumor spreading.

The basic assumption underlying the mean-ﬁeld equa-
tions derived in this paper is that all vertices within a
given degree class can be considered statistically equiva-
lent. Therefore our results are not directly applicable to
structured networks in which a distance or time ordering
can be introduced, or there is a high level of clustering.
We are currently working on more elaborate approxima-
tions of our model which could take into account such
properties, and in particular the presence of clustering,
which is known to be an important feature of social net-
works.

Furthermore, in the present work we assumed the un-
derlying network to be static, i.e. a time-independent
network topology. In reality, however, many social and
communication networks are highly dynamic. An exam-
ple of such time-dependent social networks is Internet
chatrooms, where individuals continuously make new so-
cial contacts and break old ones. Modeling the dynamics
of rumor spreading on such dynamic networks is highly
challenging, in particular when the time scale at which
network topology changes becomes comparable with the
time scale of the process dynamics. We also aim to tackle
this highly interesting problem in future work.

APPENDIX A: CRITICAL RUMOR THRESHOLD

Eq. (6) can be integrated exactly to yield:

ρi(k, t) = ρi(k, 0)e−λkφ(t),

(A1)

where ρi(k, 0) is the initial density of ignorant nodes
with connectivity k, and we have introduced the aux-

to the relevant order in φ∞ we ﬁnd

Noting that hhkii = hk2i/hki and hhk2ii = hk3i/hki we
obtain:

In order to obtain an expression for the ﬁnal size of the
rumor, R, it is more convenient to work with φ. As-
suming an homogeneous initial distribution of ignorants,
ρi(k, 0) = ρi
0, we can obtain a diﬀerential equation for
this quantity by multiplying Eq. (7) with q(k) and sum-
ming over k. This yields after some elementary manipu-
lations:

For α = 0 Eq. (A5) can be solved explicitly to obtain
Φ∞ [12]. For α 6= 0 we solve (A5) to leading order in α.
Integrating Eq. (7) to zero order in α we obtain

Close to the critical threshold both φ(t) and φ∞ are
small. Writing φ(t) = φ∞f (t), where f (t) is a ﬁnite
function, and working to leading order in φ∞, we obtain

φ∞ =

2

i

2hki( hk

λ2hk3i(1 + 2αI hk2i
hki )

.

This yields a positive value for φ∞ provided that

λ

.

Thus to leading order in α the critical rumor threshold is
independent of this quantity, and is the same as for the
SIR model. In particular, for δ = 1 the critical rumor
spreading threshold is given by λc = hki/hk2i, and Eq.
(A12) simpliﬁes to:

φ∞ =

2hki(λ − λc)
λ2hk3i(λc + 2αI)

.

(A13)

Finally, R is given by

R =

P (k)(1 − e−λkφ∞ ),

(A14)

and expanding the exponential in Eq. (A6) we obtain

R ≈

Abstract

We study the impact of volatility on intraday serial correlation, at
time scales of less than 20 minutes, exploiting a data set with all trans-
action on SPX500 futures from 1993 to 2001. We show that, while
realized volatility and intraday serial correlation are linked, this relation
is driven by unexpected volatility only, that is by the fraction of volatil-
ity which cannot be forecasted. The impact of predictable volatility is
instead found to be negative (LeBaron effect). Our results are robust to
microstructure noise, and they conﬁrm the leading economic theories
on price formation.

1 Introduction

The study of serial correlation in asset prices is of great importance in ﬁnan-
cial economics. Indeed, from the point of view of market efﬁciency (Fama,
1970), as well as market inefﬁciency (Shleifer, 2003), serial correlation is a
market anomaly which need to be addressed by economic theories. Once
serial correlation is signiﬁcantly detected in the data, see James (2003) as
an example, an explanation is needed to reconcile the empirical ﬁnding
with the assumption of informational efﬁciency of the market. This has
been typically accomplished in a rational setting (Lo and MacKinlay, 1990;
Boudoukh et al., 1994; Sentana and Wadhwani, 1992; Safvenvblad, 2000)
or in a behavioral setting (Cutler et al., 1991; Jegadeesh and Titman, 1993;
Chan, 1993; Badrinath et al., 1995; Challet and Galla, 2005).
In this pa-
per, we concentrate on very short-run serial correlation, that is we focus on
intraday data and in particular on time scales from 4 to 20 minutes.

The purpose of this paper is multiple. Beyond showing the informa-
tional efﬁciency of the considered market, which is actually out of discus-
sion given its liquidity, our aim is to study the dynamical properties of intra-
day serial correlation. We extend previous literature by decomposing intra-
day volatility, measured by means of realized volatility, into its predictable
and unpredictable part. To quantify intraday serial correlation, we use
the variance-ratio test on evenly sampled intraday data. While being very
standard for daily data, the variance ratio test has still little application on
high-frequency data, including Andersen et al. (2001); Thomas and Patnaik
(2003); Kaul and Sapp (2005).

Our main result is that intraday serial correlation is positively linked
with unexpected volatility, deﬁned as the residual in a linear regression
model for daily volatility as measured with intraday data. In other words,
unexpected volatility is that part of volatility which was not forecasted on
that market in that particular day. We also explain the puzzling results of
Bianco and Ren `o (2006) who, on a much less liquid market (Italian stock
index futures), found volatility to be positively correlated with serial corre-
lation, at odds with the result in LeBaron (1992). We show that indeed total
volatility is positively related to serial correlation: however, it is unexpected
volatility that drives this positive relation. The predictable part of volatil-
ity, that used in LeBaron (1992), turns out to be negatively related to serial
correlation, in agreement with previous literature.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 illustrates the methodology

and describes the data set. Section 3 shows the estimation results and
discusses the implications of them. Section 4 concludes.

2 Data and methodology

The data set under study is the collection of all transactions on the S&P500
stock index futures from April, 1993 to October 2001, for a total of 1,975
trading days. We have information on all futures maturity, but we use only
next-to-expiration contracts, with the S&P 500 expiring quarterly. We use
only transactions from 8 : 30 a.m. to 3 : 15 p.m.. In total, we have 4, 898, 381
transactions, that is 2, 480 per day on average, with an average duration
between adjacent trades of 9, 8 seconds. Not all high-frequency information
is used. We use instead a grid of evenly sampled data every day. We ﬁnd
that a time interval of ∆t = 4 minutes is a large enough to avoid the problem
of intervals with no price changes within. Thus, for every day, we have a
time series of 101 evenly sampled prices.

To study intraday serial correlation, we use the variance-ratio statis-
tics. This brieﬂy consists in what follows. Denote by Pk, k = 1, . . . , N a time
series and deﬁne the ﬁrst differences time series rk = Pk
Pk−1. The variance
ratio at lag q is given by

period return. We implement the variance ratio test ac-

represents the q
cording to the heteroskedastic consistent estimator (Lo and MacKinlay, 1988)
with overlapping observations (Richardson and Smith, 1993), for which the
asymptotic distribution is well known under the null, see Appendix A. In
particular, Bianco and Ren `o (2006) show that the VR test can be imple-
mented on high frequency data of stock index futures transactions, for time
scales lower than 20 minutes, given the typical heteroskedasticity of this
asset. This is in line with the robustness analysis of Deo and Richardson
(2003). We then study values of q ranging from 1 to 5, since in our case the
interval between adjacent observations is 4 minutes. For these values of q,
we can then safely use the VR test with high-frequency data in our context.

3

We then compute 1, 975 daily values of the variance ratio for q = 1, . . . , 5.
The top panel of table 1 reports the number of signiﬁcantly positive and
negative variance ratios, for different conﬁdence intervals. The positive vio-
lations are compatible with the null. The excess in negative violations can
instead be ascribed to the bid-ask bounce effect, see the thorough discus-
sion in Bianco and Ren `o (2006).

In order to quantify the daily serial correlation, we use the standardized

variance ratio at different lags q, deﬁned as:

V R(q) = √nq

ˆθ(q)

where ˆθ(q) is the heteroskedastic consistent estimator of the variance ratio
variance, see Appendix A. The time series of variance ratios at q = 1 is
shown in ﬁgure 1

Given the high persistence in volatility, also the standardized variance
ratio is found to be highly persistent. We discuss further this point in Sec-
tion 3.

We want to link serial correlation with volatility. On each day, in which

we have N returns, we deﬁne volatility as

This is the well-known measure of realized variance, see Andersen et al.
(2003). However, in what follows we argue that an other variable plays a
very special role, that is unexpected volatility. We know that volatility is
highly foreseeable in ﬁnancial markets, see Poon and Granger (2003) for a
review, mainly given its persistence. Moreover, a simple linear model for
realized volatility leads to fair forecasts, see e.g. Andersen et al. (2003);
Corsi et al. (2001). We then assume that the market volatility is forecasted
with the following linear model:

log(σ2

t ) = α + β1 log(σ2

t−1) + β2 log(σ2

t−2) + β3 log(σ2

t−3) + εt.

(5)

Even if the model (5) is fairly simple, since it ignores long-memory and
leverage effects, on the US stock index futures data it yields an R2 of 66.2%.
We then deﬁne unexpected volatility as the residuals of the above regression,

3 and unexpected

It is clear that our deﬁnition of unexpected and predictable volatility
is dependent on model (5); however the inclusion of further lags does not
change our results; and including more complicated effects does not im-
prove the speciﬁcation of model 5, see the extensive study of Hansen and Lunde
(2005). Also nonlinear speciﬁcations, as those of Maheu and McCurdy (2002),
have been found to yield forecast improvements which are not substantial.

3 Results

We start from the ﬁnding in Bianco and Ren `o (2006) that standardized vari-
ance ratios are negatively autocorrelated, and we conﬁrm this ﬁnding on US
data. However, this feature is inherited by the serial auto-correlation of the
volatility itself. To check this, we simulate a long series of a GARCH(1,1)
process with zero auto-correlation. On the simulated series we spuriously
detect an autocorrelated standardized variance ratio. Since the simulated
series is persistent, we conclude that the serial correlations of the standard-
ized VRs is a consequence of the heteroskedasticity of the data. However, in
order to get reliable speciﬁcation when the variance ratio is the dependent
variable, it is necessary to add lagged variance ratio regressors as explana-
tory variables.

As an overall speciﬁcation test for the regression, we use the Ljung-Box
test of residuals at lag 5 and we denote it by Q(5). We ﬁrst study a model in
which we include volatility as a regressor:

V Rt = α +

δi

V Rt−i + β

log(σ2

t ) + εt.

Results are in Table 2. We ﬁnd that there is a positive and signiﬁcant rela-
tion between volatility and standardized variance ratio, and the regression
is well speciﬁed if we include enough autoregressive terms for the variance
ratio, see the Ljung-Box statistics. This result is not entirely surprising. On
a much smaller market (Italy), Bianco and Ren `o (2006) provide evidence of
a positive relation between volatility and intraday serial correlation. This is

6

different from what is typically found at daily level, where the correlation
is found to be negative, according to the LeBaron effect (LeBaron, 1992;
Sentana and Wadhwani, 1992). However, this result can be explained ac-
cording to the model of reinforcement of opinions of Chan (1993). Accord-
ing to this model, serial correlation is introduced into data since once an
investor decides to buy, he observes more liquid substitutes and reinforce
his opinion according to the movements of the substitutes. This effect is
stronger when volatility is high, that is when the price move more (or more
rapidly). Thus, the Chan (1993) model posits a positive relation between
volatility and intraday serial correlation which is at all reasonable. How-
ever, for the US market the Chan model is less tenable. Indeed, for the US it
is unreasonable to look for a more liquid substitute. Thus, the effect of the
reinforcement of opinions is likely to be milder. To better understand this,
we compute the percentage of signiﬁcant VRs as volatility increases. The
violations are reported in Table 1. On the contrary on what happens on the
Italian market, where the percentage of positive violations increases when
volatility increases, we ﬁnd that this holds marginally for the US market,
conﬁrming our intuition that the mechanism of reinforcement of opinions is
likely to play a minor role in a liquid market as the US stock index futures.
We then analyze the impact of unexpected volatility. We estimate the

regression:

V Rt = α +

V Rt−i + β

σu,t + εt.

Results are shown in Table 3. Unexpected volatility is found to be highly
signiﬁcant, and we obtain a good speciﬁcation as measured by the Ljung-
Box statistics, as far as we include enough lags of the variance ratio itself
and q is large enough. Thus, it is evident that unexpected volatility plays
a crucial role in the emergence of intraday serial correlations, for all the
considered time scales.

Most importantly, our results can be reconciled with the results in

LeBaron (1992). To show this, we estimate the encompassing regression:

where both unexpected and predictable volatility are included as regres-
sors. Results are displayed in Table 4 and indicate that, while volatility has
been found to be signiﬁcant in model (7), its predictable part is negatively

day variance, but he ﬁltered the variance with a GARCH-like model, thus
he considered only the predictable part, getting a negative relation. Since
we are using a realized measure of volatility, we can decompose it into a
predictable and unpredictable part, and we consistently ﬁnd that the ﬁrst
has a negative impact on intraday serial correlation, while the second has a
large positive impact. A negative relation between predictable volatility and
intraday serial correlation could not be seen by Bianco and Ren `o (2006) in
the Italian market, given the very low statistics (three years of data only).
Thus, we conclude that unexpected volatility is the main source of intraday
serial correlation, even if, at our knowledge, there is not an economic model
explaining why the role of unexpected volatility is so important, since most
economic models use total volatility.

4 Conclusions

In this paper we study the impact of volatility on intraday serial correlation
in the US stock index futures market, which is the most liquid market in
the world. We exploit the availability of intraday data to measure volatil-
ity by means of realized variance, and intraday serial correlation by means
of standardized variance ratio. We ﬁnd that, in agreement with the eco-
nomic theory, total volatility plays a minor role in the US market, since
the mechanism of reinforcement of opinions postulated by Chan (1993) is
less important in this market. We then use our realized measure to de-
compose volatility into its predictable and unpredictable part, which we call
unexpected volatility. We extend previous ﬁndings in the literature in the
following direction. We ﬁnd that there is a positive and signiﬁcant relation
between unexpected volatility and intraday serial correlation, while we con-
ﬁrm the LeBaron effect: predictable volatility is negatively related to serial
correlation.

This result can be important for the economic theory, since this could
potentially reveal basic properties about the pricing formation mechanism.
As far as we know, there are no economic theories explaining the stylized
fact documented by our study, thus our results introduce a new challenge.
However, we presume that the role of unexpected volatility is linked to the
way information is spread in the market. In this respect, unexpected volatil-

8

ity could be potentially employed as a proxy for information asymmetry.
Further research is needed to assess this conjecture.

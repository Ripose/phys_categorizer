Abstract

We derive a theoretical two-factor model which has empirically a similar explanatory
power as the Fama-French three-factor model.
In addition to the usual market risk, our
model accounts for a diversiﬁcation risk, proxied by the equally-weighted portfolio, and
which results from an “internal consistency factor” appearing for arbitrary large economies,
as a consequence of the concentration of the market portfolio when the distribution of the
capitalization of ﬁrms is suﬃciently heavy-tailed as in real economies. Our model rationalizes
the superior performance of the Fama and French three-factor model in explaining the cross
section of stock returns: the size factor constitutes an alternative proxy of the diversiﬁcation
factor while the book-to-market eﬀect is related to the increasing sensitivity of value stocks
to this factor.

Introduction

In the standard equilibrium and/or arbitrage pricing framework, the value of any asset is
uniquely speciﬁed from the belief that only the systematic risks need to be remunerated
by the market. This is the conclusion of the CAPM (Treynor 1961, Treynor 1999, Sharpe
1964, Lintner 1965, Mossin 1966) and of the APT (Ross 1976, Roll and Ross 1980, Roll
and Ross 1984, Roll 1994). Here, we show that, even for arbitrary large economies when
the distribution of the capitalization of ﬁrms is suﬃciently heavy-tailed as is the case of real
economies, there may exist a new source of signiﬁcant systematic risk, which has been totally
neglected up to now but must be priced by the market. This new source of risk can readily
explain several asset pricing anomalies on the sole basis of the internal-consistency of the
market model.

This result is based on two ingredients. The ﬁrst one is the tautological internal consis-
tency condition that the market portfolio, and any other factor that can be replicated by
a portfolio of assets traded on the market, is constituted – by construction – of the assets
whose returns it is supposed to explain. This internal consistency condition leads mechan-
ically to correlations between the return residuals, as already stressed by Fama (1973) and
Sharpe (1990, footnote 13) when the return on the market portfolio is considered as the only
explaining factor, or by Chamberlain (1983) in the case where there exists several linearly
independent portfolios that contain only “factor” variance and are therefore optimal for any
risk-averse investor. These correlations are equivalent to the existence of at least one internal
consistency factor (uncorrelated with the market and the other explanatory factors), which
is a function of the weights of the market portfolio and of the portfolios replicating the other

factors. The impact of this new factor is usually neglected away on the basis of the law of
large numbers applied to well-diversiﬁed portfolios.

Actually, when the distribution of the weights of the portfolios replicating the explaining
factors – the distribution of the capitalization of ﬁrms in the case of the market portfolio, for
instance – is suﬃciently heavy-tailed, the law of large numbers, which is at the origin of the
diminishing contribution of the residual risks to the total risk of “well-diversiﬁed portfolios”
(Ross 1976, Huberman 1982), breaks down. Intuitively, whatever the size of the economy,
the largest ﬁrms contribute idiosyncratic risks that can not be diversiﬁed. In this case, the
generalized central limit theorem (Gnedenko and Kolmogorov 1954) shows that the impact
of an internal consistency factor does not vanish even for inﬁnite economies1. This may
be the origin of a signiﬁcant amount of risk for portfolios that would have been otherwise
assumed “well-diversiﬁed” in its absence. As a consequence, when writing down for instance
the APT, an additional explaining factor must be accounted for.

This result must be contrasted with the many seminal papers deriving the APT and
providing pricing bounds for ﬁnite economies. Indeed, following for instance Dybdig (1983)
or Grinblatt and Titman (1983), among others, the residual risk of well-diversiﬁed portfolios
resulting from the ﬁniteness of the economy should be priced but the pricing error relative
to a pure factor model disappeared in the limit of a large economy, as a full diversiﬁcation
of the non-systematic risk is achieved. In contrast, we ﬁnd that the lack of diversiﬁcation
persists even when the number of traded assets is inﬁnite. Beside, the generalization of
Ross (1976)’s results provided by Chamberlain (1983) breaks down as a result of this lack
of diversiﬁcation.
Indeed, Chamberlain (1983)’s results explicitly require that the risk of
any sequence of portfolios bearing only residual risks converges to zero if the portfolios
are well-diversiﬁed. Similarly, one cannot apply anymore Connor (1982)’s result that the
APT pricing equation holds exactly if each asset has an inﬁnitesimal weight in the economy.
Indeed, in economies with a heavy-tailed distribution of ﬁrm sizes, the largest company has
a size of the same order as the total size of all the companies2. These diﬀerent remarks
are in fact intimately entangled as will become clear in the sequel of this article. We stress
that our results are driven by the fat-tailed nature of the distribution of the weights of the
portfolios replicating the factors (when replication is possible), as occurs for the market
portfolio when the distribution of ﬁrm sizes is heavy-tailed. Our results do not rely on any
other distributional assumption concerning the explanatory factors or the disturbance terms.
For simpliﬁcation, we will assume that both the factors and the disturbance terms have ﬁnite
variance, but it is simply for the convenience of the exposition of our results. They could
easily be generalized to the case where factors and disturbance terms do not admit a ﬁnite
second moment on the basis of the result established by Wang (1988), for instance.

The introduction of our new “internal consistency factor,” which basically accounts for the
lack of diversiﬁcation of the market portfolio, allows us to provide a theoretical explanation of
several well-known pricing anomalies. In particular, the relevance of the two eﬀects studied
by Fama and French (1992, 1993, 1995), namely the small-ﬁrm eﬀect (ﬁrst documented
by Banz (1981)) and the book-to-market ratio, can be understood from and rationalized
within the theoretical framework of the ATP when the “internal consistency factor”, and
its associated diversiﬁcation premium, is accounted for. Thus, our model bridges the gap
between Fama and French phenomenological model and the arbitrage pricing theory. More
precisely, our model provides an understanding of the superior performance of Fama and

new internal consistency factor provides a rationalization of the size factor as a proxy of the

1In a diﬀerent context, Gabaix (2005) has proposed that the same kind of argument can explain that idiosyn-
cratic ﬁrm-level ﬂuctuations are responsible for an important part of aggregate shocks, and therefore provide a
microfoundation for aggregate productivity shocks. Indeed, as in the present article, it is suggested that the tradi-
tional argument according to which individual ﬁrm shocks average out in aggregate breaks down if the distribution
of ﬁrm sizes is fat-tailed, as documented empirically.

2This simply results from the large deviation theorem on heavy-tailed distribution according to which, given

N iid random variables S1, . . . , SN with a fat tailed distribution, we have (Embrechts et al. 1997)

internal consistency factor. Besides, consistent with the fact that high book-to-market stocks
have signiﬁcantly lower beta’s with respect to the market portfolio compared with low book-
to-market stocks (Bernardo et al. 2007), the book-to-market eﬀect also emerges naturally
from our formalism. In the context of the on-going debate (Lakonishok et al. 1994, Daniel
et al. 2001) on the interpretation of the two empirical eﬀects analyzed by Fama and French
(1993), we provide an explanation with solid economic underpinning.

The article is organized as follows. In the next section, we synthesize the available empir-
ical evidence on the fat-tailed nature of the distribution of ﬁrm sizes and their consequence
on the lack of diversiﬁcation of the market portfolio. Then, in section 2, we make clear
the consequences of the internal consistency condition mentioned above; due to the internal
consistency condition, we show that the disturbance terms must obey a condition which de-
termines their correlation. Next we presents our main results on the asymptotic behavior of
the variance of well-diversiﬁed portfolios: we show that, together with the market risk, there
is an additional source of systematic risk resulting from the internal consistency condition.
This additional risk may be of the same order as the market risk even for inﬁnite economies
when the distribution of the capitalization of companies is suﬃciently heavy-tailed. Section
3 conﬁrms, by use of numerical simulations, the relevance of the concentration eﬀect for
markets with a realistic number of traded assets. Then, it discusses the consequences for the
arbitrage pricing of ﬁnancial assets, providing an expression that accounts for the premium
required by the investors to bear this systematic “internal consistency” risk and we propose
proxies for the empirical assessment of this risk premium. It allows us to provide theoretical
economic explanations of some of the empirical factors reported in the literature while an
empirical analysis shows that, on the basis of only two factors (the market portfolio and
the equally-weighted portfolio), our model is at least as successful as the Fama and French
three-factor model over the period Jan. 1927 to Dec. 2005 for the US market data available
on Professor French’s website3. Section 4 summarizes our results and draw some conclusion.

1 The distribution of ﬁrm sizes and the concentration
of the market portfolio

The study of the distribution of ﬁrm sizes beneﬁts from a rich history. Zipf (1949) made
an important early contribution by establishing that US corporation assets approximately
followed the law s(n)
1/n (now referred to as the Zipf’s law): when sizes are ranked from
the largest to the smallest, Zipf’s law states that the ﬁrm size s(n) of the nth largest ﬁrm is
inversely proportional to its rank n. Inverting this relation, we have that the rank of the nth
1/s(n) which is nothing but the sample
largest ﬁrm is inversely proportional to its size n
complementary cumulative distribution of the Pareto law with a tail exponent µ = 1.

Zipf’s law seems to be a robust property of business ﬁrms4 (Ijri and Simon 1977). Indeed,
several proxies for the size of companies have been used which recover the same robust
results that the exponent µ is equal or close to 1: assets, market capitalizations, number of
employees, proﬁts, revenues, sales, value added and so on (Axtell 2001, Axtell 2006, Gabaix
et al. 2006, Marsili 2005, Simon and Bonini 1958). Beside, Ramsden and Kiss-Haypa (2000)
have analyzed the distribution of ﬁrms by revenues in 20 countries in America, Asia and
Europe and report an exponent µ ranging from 0.44 to 1.25 with a median value equal to
0.85.

Several models have attempted to provide explanations for the distribution of ﬁrm sizes,
in terms of the law of proportional eﬀect (Gibrat 1931, Simon and Bonini 1958), of economies
of scale and costs reduction (Bain 1956, Robinson 1961), of the distribution of managerial
talents and eﬃcient allocation of productivity factors across managers (Lucas 1978), or of
the partition of the set of workers (Axtell 2006), among others. But, only recently, the
closeness of the exponent µ to the value 1 has been justiﬁed from a simple argument proposed
by Gabaix et al. (2006). They have transposed the mechanism given for cities (Gabaix
1999a, Gabaix and Ioannides 2004, and the references therein) to ﬁrm sizes and mutual

fund capitalizations: starting from the traditional argument based upon Gibrat’s law of
proportional eﬀect, whereby ﬁrm growth is treated as a random process and growth rates
are independent of ﬁrm size, a log-normal process modiﬁed with small perturbations to ensure
convergence to a non-degenerate steady-state distribution yields a power law distribution.
The value of its exponent µ = 1 then results from the condition that the average normalized
size of ﬁrms stays constant in a stationary economy.

Consubstantial with the fat tailed character of the distribution of ﬁrm sizes is the concen-
tration of the market portfolio. Indeed, the market portfolio, deﬁned as the value-weighted
portfolio of all the assets traded on a given market suﬀers from an inherent lack of diver-
siﬁcation, resulting from the fat tail distribution of ﬁrm sizes, in the sense that only a few
dozen of companies account for a very large part of the overall market capitalization. For
instance, the top ten largest companies of the US market represents about one ﬁfth to one
fourth of the US market capitalization.

More generally, given an economy of N ﬁrms, whose sizes Si, i = 1, . . . , N , follow a Pareto
law with tail index µ, the ratio of the capitalization of the largest ﬁrm to the total market
capitalization

which is nothing but the weight of the largest company in the market portfolio, behaves on

as the number of ﬁrms N goes to inﬁnity (Bingham et al. 1987).

This result means that when the distribution of ﬁrm sizes admits a ﬁnite mean, the weight
of the largest ﬁrm in the market portfolio goes to zero, and so do the weights of any other
ﬁrms, in the limit of a large market. In terms of asset pricing, the fact that the weight of each
individual ﬁrm in the economy is inﬁnitesimal ensures that the APT pricing equation holds
for each asset and not only on average (Connor 1982). In contrast, when the distribution
of ﬁrm sizes has no ﬁnite mean, the asymptotic weight of the largest ﬁrm in the market
portfolio does not vanish, illustrating the fact that for such an economy, the market portfolio
is not well diversiﬁed, all the more so the smallest the tail index µ. A practical consequence
is then that the APT pricing equation, if it holds, only holds on average, with possibly large
pricing errors for individual assets.

In order to get a closer look at the concentration of the market portfolio, we focus on its
Herﬁndahl index, which is perhaps the most widely used measure of economic concentration
(Polakoﬀ 1981, Lovett 1988),

HN =

2 =

wm||
||

w2

m,i ,

N

i=1
X

where wm,i denotes the weight of asset i in the market portfolio whose composition is given
by the N -dimensional vector wm. The Herﬁndahl takes into account the relative size and
distribution of the ﬁrms traded on the market. It approaches zero when the market consists
of a large number of ﬁrms with comparable sizes. It increases both as the number of ﬁrms in
the market decreases and as the disparity in size between those ﬁrms increases. Our use of
the Herﬁndahl index is not only guided by common practice but also by its superior ability to
provide meaningful information about the degree of diversiﬁcation of an unevenly distributed
stock portfolio (Woerheide and Persson 1993). Following tradition, we say that a portfolio
is well-diversiﬁed, if its Herﬁndahl index goes to zero when the number N of ﬁrms traded in
the market goes to inﬁnity.

For illustration purpose, let us ﬁrst concentrate on an economy where the sizes, sorted in

descending order, of the N ﬁrms are deterministically given by

We have arbitrarily chosen the size of the smallest ﬁrm as equal to one. Alternatively, one
can think of Si,N as the size of the ith largest ﬁrm relative to the size of the smallest one.
With this simple model, the rank i of the ith largest company is directly proportional to its
size taken to the power of minus µ, as it should in order for the distribution of sizes to obey
a Pareto law with a tail index equal to µ. It is easy to check that the weight of the largest
ﬁrm in the market portfolio goes to zero, as N goes to inﬁnity, when µ is larger than or equal
to one while it goes to some positive constant when µ is less than one. More precisely, we

In accordance with the behavior of the weight of the largest ﬁrm, HN goes to zero when
the index µ is larger than or equal to one, while it goes to some positive constant otherwise.
However, the decay rate of HN toward zero becomes slower and slower as µ approaches
1 (from above). In practice, when the number of traded ﬁrms is large – but ﬁnite – the
concentration of the market portfolio can remain signiﬁcant even if µ is larger than one,
speciﬁcally when µ lies between one and two.

In order to illustrate this situation, the upper panel of ﬁgure 1 depicts the value of the
weight of the largest ﬁrm in the market portfolio while the lower panel shows the Herﬁndahl
index as a function of µ. The plain curves show the limit situation of an inﬁnite economy
while the dotted and dash-dotted curves account for the eﬀect of a ﬁnite economy: the dotted
curve refers to the case where only one thousand companies are traded while the dash-dotted
curve corresponds to an economy with ten thousand ﬁrms. Clearly, ﬁnite economy size eﬀects
cannot be neglected for market sizes as found in the real economy.

[Insert Figure 1 about here]

To be a little bit more general, we now consider the case where the ﬁrm sizes are randomly
drawn from a power law distribution of size. By application of the generalized law of large
numbers (Feller 1971, Gnedenko and Kolmogorov 1954, Ibragimov and Linnik 1975) and
using standard results on the limit distribution of self-normalized sums (Darling 1952, Logan
et al. 1973), we can state that

This shows that, even if the concentration of the market portfolio goes to zero in the limit of
an inﬁnite economy, it goes to zero extremely slowly as the size N of the economy diverges.
Accounting for the fact that the median value of the L´evy law (10) is approximately equal
5% for a market where 7000 to 8000 assets are traded8,
to 2.198, a typical value of HN is 4
which is much higher than the concentration index of a well-diversiﬁed portfolio – typically
the equally-weighted portfolio – which should be of the order of 0.012

asset, irrespective of its size, as predicted by the CAPM and (ii) if it is actually optimal
for a rational investor to put her money in this risky portfolio alone, as proposed by the
two-fund separation theorem. This suggests that the lack of diversiﬁcation of the market
portfolio is responsible, to a large extent, for the failure of the CAPM to explain the cross-
section of stock returns. This failure has been documented in particular by Fama and French
(1992, 1993), who ﬁnd basically no support for the CAPM’s central result of a positive rela-
tion between expected returns and the global market risk (quantiﬁed by the beta parameter).
This therefore raises the question of the existence of a concentration premium.

Many authors have proposed alternative or additional factors in the quest to cure the
deﬁciencies of the CAPM and provide explanations for the so-called pricing anomalies. Three
main classes of additional factors can be distinguished: macro-economic factors, ﬁrm-speciﬁc
factors and behavioral factors.

Macro-economic factors. The positive or negative impact on stock prices of macro-
economic factors such as interest rates (Chen et al. 1986), exchange rates (Harvey 1991,
Ferson and Harvey 1993), real output (Culter et al. 1989, Chen et al. 1986), inﬂation and
money supply (Bodie 1976, Fama 1981, Geske and Roll 1983, Pearce and Roley 1983,
1985), aggregate consumption (Jagannathan and Wang 2007, and references therein),
oil prices (Chen et al. 1986, Ferson and Harvey 1993, Jones and Kaul 1996), labor
income (Jagannathan and Wang 1996, Reyfman 1997) and so on, has been underlined
in many studies based on the APT (Ross 1976, Roll and Ross 1984, Roll 1994) or in the
context of equilibrium (Burmeister and Wall 1986, Flannery and Protopapadakis 2002).

Firm-speciﬁc factors. The fact that industry sector groupings may be important in
the study of the return generating process has been stressed for a long time (King
1966, Alexander and Francis 1986). Similarly, the importance of market capitalization
(or small-ﬁrm eﬀect) has been documented in the early eighties by Banz (1981) and
Reinganum (1981) while Stattman (1980) and Rosenberg et al. (1985) underlined the
role of the book-to-market ratio. If other ratios such as the earnings-to-price ratio (Basu
1977) and the dividend yield (Blume 1980, Rozeﬀ 1984, Keim 1985) for instance, also
predict future returns, most of the attention has been drawn to the size and the book-to-
market eﬀect during the past decade as a result of their superior performance to explain
the cross-section of stock returns (Fama and French 1992, 1993,1995,1996). Among
various interpretation of the explaining power of the size and the book-to-market ratio,
Campbell and Vuolteenoha (2004) and Campbell et al. (2005) have considered breaking
the beta of a stock with the market portfolio into two components, one reﬂecting
news about the market’s future cash ﬂows and one reﬂecting news about the market’s
discount rates in order explain the size and value “anomalies” in stock returns.

Behavioral factors. Two major issues have been considered. On the one hand, Ru-
binstein (1973) and Krauss and Litzenberger (1976) have proposed to account for the
departure of the distributions of returns from normality and for the sensibility of the
investors for the skewness and kurtosis of the distribution of stock returns. The rele-
vance of this approach has been underlined by Lim (1989) and Harvey and Siddique
(2000) who have tested the role of the asymmetry in the risk premium by accounting
for the skewness of the distribution of returns. Along the same line, many other exten-
sions have been presented such as the VaR-CAPM (Alexander and Baptista 2002), in
order to account more carefully for the risk perception of investors. On the other hand,
several studies have developed phenomenological models capturing the reversal of long-
term returns (Chan 1988, Chopra et al. 1992, DeBondt and Thaler 1985, 1987) and the
continuation of short-term trends (Chan et al. 1996, Jegadeesh and Titman 1993, Je-
gadeesh and Titman 2001, Richards 1999).

Most of these factors actually provide a signiﬁcant improvement in explaining the cross-
section of asset returns. However they do not provide a clear identiﬁcation of the most
prominent ones. Even if the Fama and French three factor model is now widely recognized
as the benchmark, the reasons for its superiority in explaining the cross-section of asset
returns are still debated. It is in this context that we propose to focus on the consequences
of the undisputable fact that the market portfolio is highly concentrated on a small number
of very large companies and therefore can obviously not account for the behavior of the
smallest ones. As we are going to demonstrate, this will allow us to rationalize the size

7

eﬀect, in relation with what we propose to call a “diversiﬁcation factor,” which, to some
extent, also justify the relevance of the book-to-market factor.

Internal consistency conditions of factor models and

2
their consequences on diversiﬁcation

Under the assumption that the return on the market portfolio is a factor explaining the
return on individual assets, our demonstration is based on two ingredients.

The internal consistency condition states that the market portfolio is made of the
assets whose returns it is supposed to explain. As a consequence, there are correlations
between the disturbance terms.

The lack of diversiﬁcation of the market portfolio (associated with the fat tail dis-
tribution of ﬁrm sizes) make these correlations non-negligible, giving birth to an ad-
ditional factor which signiﬁcantly contributes to the asymptotic variance of a priori
well-diversiﬁed portfolios.

2.1 The factor model

Consider an economy with N ﬁrms whose returns on stock prices are determined according
to the following equation

~r = ~α + ~βm ·

[rm −

E [rm]] + B ~φ + ~ε,

(11)

where

~r is the random N

1 vector of asset returns;

×
~α = E [~r] is the N
1 vector of asset return mean values. We do not make any
assumption neither on the ex-ante mean-variance eﬃciency of the market portfolio, nor
on the absence of arbitrage opportunity, so that ~α is not, a priori, speciﬁed;

×

1 vector of the factor loadings of the market factor;

rm is the random return on the market portfolio;
~βm is the N
~φ is the random N
(E [φi] = 0), unit variance, are uncorrelated with each other and with rm;
B is the N

q matrix of factor loadings;

×

×

1 vector of risk factors φi which are assumed to have zero mean

~ε is the random N
covariance matrix Ω = E [~ε
with the market return rm and the factors φi.

×

·

1 vector of disturbance terms with zero average E [~ε] = ~0 and
~ε]. The disturbance terms are assumed to be uncorrelated

×

It would be natural to assume that (i) Ω is diagonal in order to have the ith contribution of
~ε embodying the speciﬁc risk contribution to the ith asset but, as we shall see in the sequel,
the internal consistency condition makes this impossible and forces the disturbances ~ε to be
correlated. A weaker hypothesis on Ω would be that (ii) all its eigenvalues are uniformly
bounded from above by some constant λ (i.e., the bound is independent of the size of the
λ). This implies that the covariance matrix of the stock returns

where the prime denotes the transpose operator, has an approximate q + 1 factor struc-
ture, according to the deﬁnition in Chamberlain (1983) and Chamberlain and Rothschild
(1983). But these two assumptions (i) and (ii) are in fact equivalent, as shown by Grinblatt
and Titman (1985).
Indeed, a simple repackaging of the N security returns into N new
returns constructed by forming N portfolios of the primitive assets allows one to get a new
formulation of expression (11) with mutually uncorrelated disturbance terms.

(cid:3)

To understand why the disturbance terms cannot be uncorrelated, let us ﬁrst denote by
~wm the vector of the weights of the market portfolio. Accounting for the fact that the market

8

factor is itself built upon the universe of assets that it is supposed to explain, the model must
necessarily fulﬁll the internal consistency relation

Several authors have pointed out a consequence of the internal consistency condition
that the market portfolio is made of (or can be replicated by) the assets they are intended
to explain (Fama 1973, Sharpe 1990). An a priori important consequence of this internal
consistency condition is the breakdown of the standard assumption of independence (or, at
least, of the absence of correlation) between the non-systematic components of the returns of
securities. In other words, the standard factor model decompositions assume that the distur-
bance terms for security i are uncorrelated with the comparable components for security j.
But, this cannot be strictly the case as can be seen from the above derivation. This presence
of correlations between the disturbance terms may a priori pose problems in the pricing of
portfolio risks: only when the disturbance terms can be averaged out by diversiﬁcation can
one conclude that the only non-diversiﬁable risk of a portfolio is born out by the contribution
of the market portfolio which is weighted by the beta of the portfolio under consideration.
Previous authors have suggested that this is indeed what happens in economies in the limit
, for which the correlations between the disturbance terms vanish
of a large market N
asymptotically and the internal consistency condition seems irrelevant. For example, while
Sharpe (1990, footnote 13) concluded that, as a consequence of equation (15), at least two of
the disturbances, say εi and εj, must be negatively correlated, he suggested that this prob-
lem may disappear in economies with inﬁnitely many securities. Actually, we show below
that this apparently quite reasonable line of reasoning does not tell the whole story: even for
economies with inﬁnitely many securities, when the companies exhibit a large distribution
of sizes as they do in reality, the constraint (15) can lead to the important consequence that
the risk born out by an investor holding a well-diversiﬁed portfolio does not reduce to the
market risk in the limit of a very large portfolio, as usually believed. A signiﬁcant proportion
of “speciﬁc risk” may remain which cannot be diversiﬁed away by a simple aggregation of a
very large number of assets.

2.2 Correlation structure of the disturbance terms

The fact that the disturbance terms ~ε in the market model (11) are correlated according to
the condition (15) means that there exists at least one common “factor” f to the ε’s, so that
~ε can be expressed as

·
where ~γ is the vector of loading of the factor f 10. The factor f could be chosen a priori
such as to explain one of the many anomalies reported in the previous section. But, as
recalled, we want to move away from this logic of invoking macro-economic, ﬁrm-speciﬁc

~ε = ~γ

10With this representation, we avoid the case where the explaining factor – here the market portfolio – could
be replicated by a single traded asset. Indeed, in such a case, the replicating portfolio would be concentrated on
one single asset, say the ﬁrst one, so that the internal consistency condition would read ε1 = 0 without any other
constraint on the εi, i > 1.

or behavioral factors. We prefer to focus on the parsimonious single market factor model,
and just account for the lack of diversiﬁcation of the market portfolio which calls for a
diversiﬁcation premium. As a bonus, we will see that this strategy turns out to provide
a fundamental basis of explaining a signiﬁcant part of the pricing anomalies. Our only
requirement is that the covariance matrix of ~ε exhibits an eigenvalue that goes to inﬁnity in
the limit of an inﬁnite economy, when HN does not go to zero. In contrast, when HN goes
to zero as N
, the largest eigenvalue should remain bounded. This requirement derives
simply from the results of Chamberlain (1983) and Chamberlain and Rothschild (1983),
who have linked the existence of K unbounded eigenvalues (in the limit N
) of the
covariance matrix of the asset returns to a unique approximate factor structure, such that
the K associated eigenvectors converge and play the role of K factor loadings.

For simplicity, we choose ~η to be a vector of uncorrelated residuals with zero mean11.

~η if it was – but is rather an “endogenous” factor. The market model (11) then becomes

In order to understand and illustrate the relevance and the limits of the assertion accord-

be negligible in an inﬁnite size market (Fama 1973, Sharpe 1990), let us now evaluate their
typical magnitude. To simplify the notations, let us rescale without loss of generality the
vector ~γ by ~w′

11It should be enough to assume that all the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of ~η are positive and uniformly

bounded by some positive constant (Grinblatt and Titman 1983).

Then, expression (24) shows that, provided that the market portfolio is suﬃciently well-
diversiﬁed, namely provided that the weight of each asset and the concentration index goes to
zero in the limit of a large market (N
), the correlations ρij between any two disturbance

terms goes to zero as usually assumed. However, the largest eigenvalue of the correlation
matrix, associated with the (asymptotic) eigenvector ~1 = (1, 1, . . . , 1)′, is λmax,N ≃

and goes to inﬁnity, as the size of the economy growths unbounded, as soon as HN goes to
zero more slowly than 1/N . This clearly shows that the correlations between the disturbance
terms are not necessarily negligible.

N

·

The question, that we now have to address, is whether these weak correlations may
challenge the usual assumption that well-diversiﬁed portfolios do not bear additional non-
diversiﬁed sources of risks. For this, let us consider a well diversiﬁed portfolio ~wp, i.e., a
0 as the size of the economy goes to inﬁnity. From equation

(21), the residual variance of this portfolio, namely the part of the variance of the portfolio
that cannot be ascribed to systematic risk factors, reads

Therefore, the residual variance ~w′
pΩ ~wp of any “well-diversiﬁed portfolio” ~wp goes to zero, as
the size N of the economy goes to inﬁnity, if and only if the concentration index HN of the
market portfolio goes to zero. In the case of a real economy, section 1 has shown that the
Herﬁndahl index HN of the market portfolio goes to zero but at the particularly slow decay
rate of 1/(ln N )2. As a consequence, the residual variance may still account for a signiﬁcant
part of the total portfolio variance. We will give a numerical example in the next paragraph
providing a more precise statement concerning the behavior of the residual variance of the
equally-weighted portfolio.

2.3 Asymptotic behavior of the variance of the excess return of the
equally-weighted portfolio

In order to investigate more precisely the impact of the correlations between the disturbance

By the same kind of arguments as in Proposition 1, we get that the contribution (32)
exhibits three diﬀerent behaviors. Either the variance of the distribution of ﬁrm sizes is
ﬁnite and the term (32) goes to zero has 1/N , or only the mean of the distribution of ﬁrm
sizes exists and the term (32) goes to zero at a much slower rate or, ﬁnally, if the mean of
the distribution of ﬁrm sizes does not exist, the additional risk term (32) converges to some
ﬁnite positive value. More precisely, we can state the following results:

portfolio, while asymptotically proportional to the variance of the market portfolio, receives
a signiﬁcant contribution due to the internal consistent condition together with the Zipf
distribution of company sizes. This additional contribution decays to zero extremely slowly
with the number N of companies in the economy. For instance, (i) assuming that the variance
∆ii of the residuals ηi is the same for all of them and, a priori, of the same order as the

So, assuming that βe is about one and considering a market where 7000 to 8000 assets are
traded14, the typical amplitude of the additional term represents 5% of the total variance of
the equally-weighted portfolio. More precisely, in one case out of two, the contribution of
the additional term is larger than 5% of the total variance. Figure 2 presents the probability
to reach or exceed a given level for the contribution of the residual variance to the total
variance, in an economy with 7000-8000 traded assets. In one case out at four (p = 0.25),
the contribution of the residual variance to the total variance is larger than 15%; in one case

Expression (35) has a simple intuitive meaning based upon the standard interpretation
of the Herﬁndahl index as the inverse of the eﬀective number of assets of a portfolio, if
this portfolio was well-diversiﬁed (in fact, equally-weighted). Indeed, considering an equally-
weighted portfolio made of n assets, its Herﬁndahl index is H = 1/n. Conversely, given a
portfolio whose Herﬁndahl index is H, its eﬀective number of assets, deﬁned as the number
of assets of an equally-weighted portfolio with the same value H of the Herﬁndahl index, is
nef f = 1/H. Therefore, considering that the real market is not made of N (
8000)
25) eﬀective assets, equation (35) expresses the
assets but actually of Nef f = 1/HN (

variance of the portfolio resulting from the exposition to the market risk β2

the second one represents the residual variance of the Nef f = 1/HN assets. The constant
Kµ appears as the average residual variance of the Nef f assets. Thus, when the market
portfolio is well-diversiﬁed, HN goes to zero, or equivalently, the number of eﬀective assets
goes to inﬁnity so that, by virtue of the law of large numbers, the residual variance Kµ/Nef f
goes to zero. In contrast, when the market portfolio is concentrated on a few assets, HN
does not go to zero, the number of eﬀective assets remains ﬁnite in the limit of an inﬁnite
economy and the residual variance does not go to zero.

For illustration purpose, we discuss in turn three cases. First, both propositions 1 and
2 show that the concentration index HN and the variance of f are of the order of 1/N ,
like the last two terms in the r.h.s. of expression (30), provided that the variance of the
distribution of ﬁrm sizes is ﬁnite. As a consequence, for such distributions of ﬁrm sizes, the
market portfolio is well diversiﬁed insofar as the concentration index is of the same order as
the inverse of the number of assets in the portfolio. As a consequence, there is no additional
non-diversiﬁable risk and, in the limit of a large market, we have

Var re = β2
e ·

Var rm + Op(N −1).

Let us consider the example of a distribution of ﬁrm sizes given by a Gamma law Γ(r, λ). In
such a case, it is well-known that the joint distribution of
is a multivariate Beta
law with parameter r (Mosimann 1962), which yields

in accordance with the fact that Hn = 1

N + op(1/N ).
Second, if the distribution of ﬁrm sizes admits only a ﬁnite mean value and, in addition,
is regularly varying at inﬁnity with a tail index µ
(1, 2), the propositions 1 and 2 state
that both the concentration index and the variance of f are of the order of 1/N 2(1−1/µ). As
a consequence, the contribution to the total risk due to the second term in the r.h.s. of (30)
decays to zero much slower than the decay

1/N of the two last terms. Then

As an example, if the tail index of the distribution of ﬁrm sizes is µ = 3/2, the ratio of the
second term in the r.h.s. of (30) over the last two terms is of the order of N 1/3. Therefore,
assuming that the prefactors of these contributions have the same magnitude, the second
term is typically 10, 21 and 46 times larger than the last two terms, if one thousand, ten
thousands and one hundred thousand companies are traded on the market.

Finally, if the distribution of ﬁrm sizes does not even admit a ﬁnite mean value but is
still regularly varying at inﬁnity with a tail index µ
(0, 1), propositions 1 and 2 show that
the Herﬁndahl index and the variance of f converge to non-degenerated random variables
which are the ratio of two positive and dependent stable random variables:

The ﬁrst term in the r.h.s. of (42) is the non-diversiﬁable market risk which is remunerated

that due to (i) the dependence between the ~ε resulting from the internal consistency condition

occur even in the limit of a market with an inﬁnite number of assets. Consider the example

2.5 Generalization to arbitrary well-diversiﬁed portfolios

The detailed results obtained until now in section 2 refer to one particular portfolio, the
equally-weighted portfolio. This portfolio is interesting because it is often taken as a reference
and as a starting point to more elaborate allocations by analysts and practitioners. However,
from the previous sections, it seems natural to conjecture that the results summarized in
proposition 2 also hold (with suitable adaptation) for the entire class of well-diversiﬁed
portfolios as suggested by equation (29). By well-diversiﬁed portfolio is meant a portfolio of
N assets whose concentration index goes to zero in the limit of large N . In the particular
case where we consider a portfolio p, with weight on asset i given by wp,i = αi/N , where the
αi’s have to sum up to N in order to ensure that the sum of the fractions of wealth invested
in each asset is equal to one and such that 1
i is uniformly bounded from above by
N
some ﬁnite constant, the Herﬁndahl index of p behaves as

portfolio p with the market portfolio. Therefore, we conclude that proposition 2 holds for
the entire class of portfolios whose Herﬁndahl index decays to zero as C/N , for large N . In
fact, the result holds for this class of long portfolios, i.e. such that the weights αi/N sum
up to one. In the case of an arbitrage portfolio, namely a portfolio whose weights αi/N sum
up to zero, no additional term appears in the variance (45).

Finally, when the concentration index of the portfolio under consideration goes to zero,
but at rate slower from 1/N , obtaining a detailed result for the variance of the portfolio’s
return involves more complex formulas. For the present work, equation (29) is suﬃcient to
state that, in general, well-diversiﬁed portfolios, of which the equally-weighted portfolio is
just an example, have generally a non-diversiﬁed risk which does not vanish in the limit of
large economies, if the distribution of ﬁrm capitalizations is suﬃciently heavy-tailed. There-
fore, holding a portfolio with asymptotically vanishing Herﬁndahl index does not necessarily
diversify away the non-systematic risk.

3.1 Analysis of synthetic markets generated numerically

In order to assess the impact of the internal consistency factor in real stock markets of ﬁnite
size, we present in table 1 the results of numerical simulations of synthetic markets with
respectively N = 1000 and N = 10000 traded assets. We construct the synthetic markets
according to model (19) so that the only explicit explaining factor is the market factor and
the size distribution of the capitalization of ﬁrms is the Pareto distribution

Pr [S

s] =

1s≥1 .

(46)

We investigate various synthetic markets characterized by diﬀerent tail index µ, from µ = 1/2
(deep in the heavy-tailed regime), µ = 1 (borderline case often referred to as the Zipf law
when expressed with sizes plotted as a function of ranks) to µ = 2 (for which the central
limit theorem holds and standard results are expected). It is important to stress that the
results presented in table 1 are insensitive to the shape of the bulk of the distribution of ﬁrm
sizes, and only the tail Pr [S

s−µ, for large s, matters.
The three values of the tail index µ equal to 2, 1 and 1/2 correspond to the three major
behaviors of the residual variance of a “well-diversiﬁed” portfolio, namely the part of the
total variance related to the disturbance term ε only, given by proposition 2:

for µ = 2, the residual variance goes to zero as 1/N , so that the market return should
be the only relevant explaining factor if the the number of traded assets is large enough;

for µ = 1, the residual variance goes very slowly to zero, so that one can expect a
signiﬁcant contribution to the total risk and a strong impact of the internal consistency
factor f for large (but ﬁnite) market sizes;

for µ = 1/2, the residual variance does not go to zero and one can expect that the
contribution of the residual variance to the total risk remains a ﬁnite contribution as
the size of the market increases without bounds.

×

×

For each value µ = 2, µ = 1 and µ = 1/2, we generate 100 synthetic markets of each
size N = 1000 and N = 10000 (hence a total of 3
100 synthetic markets). For each
market, we construct 20 equally weighted portfolios (randomly drawn from each market) and
we regress their returns on the returns of the market portfolio (rm), on the returns of the
market portfolio and of the internal consistency factor (rm, f ), on the returns of the market
portfolio and of the (overall) equally weighted portfolio (rm, re), on the returns of the market
portfolio and of an arbitrary under-diversiﬁed portfolio (rm, ru) and on the returns of the
market portfolio and of an arbitrary well-diversiﬁed arbitrage portfolio (rm, ra). Using the
100 market simulations for each case (µ, N ), Table 1 summarizes the mean, minimum and
maximum values of the coeﬃcient of determination R2 of these ﬁve regressions of the 20
equally weighted portfolios.

[Insert Table 1 about here]

16

For µ = 2, as was expected, the market return is the only relevant factor: it accounts on
average for about 95% and 99% (for N = 1000 and N = 10000 assets, respectively) of the
total variance of the 20 equally-weighted portfolios under considerations. The fact, that the
explained variance increases from 95% to 99% when going from N = 1000 to N = 10000
assets, results from the standard diversiﬁcation eﬀect: for N = 1000, each of the 20 equally-
weighted portfolios are made of only 1000/20=50 assets compared with 10000/20=500 assets
for N = 10000. As a conﬁrmation, the minimum and maximum values of the R2 remains
very close to their respective mean values.

For µ = 1, the market factor explains a much smaller part of the total variance compared
with the previous case (80% and 88%, respectively for N = 1000 and N = 10000 assets).
As expected, this eﬀect is stronger for the markets with the smallest number N = 1000 of
traded assets. In addition, the minimum R2 (1% and 20%, resp.) departs strongly from
its mean value. Besides, the regression on the market factor and the internal consistency
factor f (which is readily accessible in the case of a numerical simulation) provides a level of
explanation (95% and 99%, respectively) comparable to that of the case µ = 2 for which full
diversiﬁcation of the residual risk occurs. Moreover, the equally-weighted portfolio provides
the same level of explanation as f itself. This is particularly interesting insofar as f is not
observable in a real market while the return on the equally-weighted portfolio can always
be calculated, or at least proxied. We ﬁnd more generally that any well-diversiﬁed portfolio
provides overall the same explaining power. This result is simply related to the fact that the
internal consistency factor f is responsible for the lack of diversiﬁcation of “ well-diversiﬁed”
portfolios (when µ . 1) so that the return on any “well-diversiﬁed” portfolio p reads rp ≃
f . This suggests that the equally-weighted portfolio or any well-diversiﬁed
αp +βp ·
portfolio , in so far as it is strongly sensitive to the internal consistency factor f , may act as
a good proxy for this factor.

rm +E [γ]

·

In contrast, the regression on any under-diversiﬁed portfolio, while improving on the
regression performed just using the market portfolio, remains of lower quality: the gain
in R2 is only 5-6% on average with respect to the regression on the sole market portfolio,
while the gain in R2 lies in the range 10-15% when using the equally-weighted portfolio.
Finally, table 1 shows that the introduction of an arbitrage portfolio does not improve the
regression. This is due to the fact that arbitrage portfolios are not asymptotically sensitive
to the internal consistency factor f in the large N limit, as recalled in section II-2.5.

The same conclusions hold qualitatively for synthetic markets generated with µ = 1/2,
with the important quantitative change that the explanatory power of the market factor
does not increase with the market size N . This expresses the predicted property that the
internal consistency factor f should have an asymptotically ﬁnite contribution to the residual
variance as the size of the market increases without bounds.

Finally, our numerical tests conﬁrm that the distributional properties of the γ’s (the
factors loading of the residuals on the internal consistency factor f ) have no signiﬁcant
γ
impact on the results of the simulation, provided that E [

3.2 Consequences for the Arbitrage Pricing Theory and the stan-
dard pricing anomalies

In his article establishing the arbitrage pricing theory, Ross (1976, p. 347) explicitly assumes
that the disturbance terms in the factor model (11) are “mutually stochastically uncorre-
lated,” which is inconsistent with the constraint (15) if we assume that the factors (or at
least some of them) can be replicated by assets portfolios.
Indeed, the derivation of the
APT results from the construction of a well-diversiﬁed arbitrage portfolio (step 1 in Ross
(1976, p. 342)) chosen so as to have no systematic risk (step 2). The fact that this arbitrage
portfolio is well-diversiﬁed is important because it is at the basis of the argument for the
diversiﬁcation of the speciﬁc risk of the arbitrage portfolio in the limit of a large number of
assets (law of large numbers), which conditions the results of steps 3 and 4 in Ross (1976).
Unfortunately, as shown in section II-E, if one of the factors can be replicated by a portfolio
whose weights are distributed according to a suﬃciently fat-tailed distribution, the speciﬁc
risk of this portfolio cannot be diversiﬁed away even if it is a well-diversiﬁed portfolio, as
deﬁned in section II-E. In that case, the conclusion resulting from steps 3 and 4 in Ross
(1976) breaks down.

17

Alternatively, we can say that the residual risks exhibit too strong correlations. This
problem has been tackled by many authors. In particular, Chamberlain (1983) and Cham-
berlain and Rothschild (1983) have developed the appropriate formalism to deal with it,
while Stambaugh (1982) and Ingersoll (1984) have provided sharp pricing bounds in the
presence of correlation between the error terms. Basically, when all the eigenvalues of their
covariance matrix remains bounded as more and more assets are added to the market until
its size goes to inﬁnity, the ATP holds. In contrast, when several eigenvalues grow without
bound, the factors associated with these eigenvalues must be split oﬀ from the residuals
and considered as new explaining factors that should be priced. This argument is at the
basis of the choice of the speciﬁcation (17) of the dependence structure of the disturbances
of our market model. Therefore, if we explicitly include our additional internal consistency
risk factor f in the analysis, the original derivation of Ross’ results still holds, as shown by
Chamberlain (1983). Indeed, a key technical assumption for the APT to hold is that the
εi’s (in equation (11)) are “suﬃciently independent to ensure that the law of large numbers
holds” (Ross 1976, p. 342) and, as explained in the previous sections, this condition breaks
down. Nonetheless, this condition holds for the residuals ηi deﬁned by equations (17-19).
Then, for the one factor model (19), the following result holds:

Proposition 3. Consider a market where N assets are traded and for which the internal
consistency condition (15) holds, so that the returns of the set of assets obey the following
dynamics: ~r = E [~r] + ~β
f + ~η, where f is the (zero-mean) additional
·
factor resulting from the internal consistency condition and rm is uncorrelated with f and
the centered disturbance vector ~η. Then, under the usual assumptions required for the APT
to hold, the expected return on asset i satisﬁes

The proof of this result proceeds as follows. Starting from the model (19) and following

result

E [~r] = ρ~1 + λ1 ~β + λ2~γ,

(48)

where ρ, λ1 and λ2 are three non-negative constants. Their values are determined by ex-
pressing the expected return on the market portfolio wm, on the portfolio wicc and on any
well-diversiﬁed portfolio without any systematic risk. This leads to identifying ρ with r0,

Two comments are in order. Firstly, expression (47) looks like a standard APT decom-
position of the risk premia of the expected return of a given asset i weighted by their factor
loading, except for one important feature: the risk premium due to the internal consistency
factor has its amplitude controlled by the factor loading γi (as usual) corrected by the un-
usual term
γmβi. In a standard factor decomposition, it is always convenient to impose
m.~γ = 0 so that the contribution to the total risk premium due to any factor is
γm ≡
proportional to its corresponding factor loading γi. In the factor decomposition including
the internal consistency factor, this is intrinsically impossible, as we have stressed above. In
this sense, expression (47) is not the result of a standard factor decomposition. It is however
the correct decomposition for a one factor model in the presence of the internal consistency
condition, which may lead to the creation of the new internal consistency factor. The later
should in fact be referred to as an endogenous factor. This decomposition leading to (47) is
the correct one in particular to highlight the crucial consequence of the internal consistency
condition in the contribution of the endogenous factor to the total risk premium of a given
asset. As we shall see, the fact that the factor loading βi of the market portfolio contributes
to the amplitude of the risk premium due to the endogenous factor provides an interesting
interpretation of the book-to-market eﬀect.

18

Secondly, in the case where the market portfolio is well-diversiﬁed, the contribution of
the additional risk factor f vanishes asymptotically so that the risk premium associated with
this risk factor goes to zero in the limit of an inﬁnitely large market.

3.3 Empirical consequences

E [ricc −

The pricing formula given by proposition 3 oﬀers an interesting new insight into the valu-
ation of asset prices. However, the direct assessment of the risk premium associated with
the internal consistency risk factor ICC is not possible because we do not have a priori
access to it, so that the practical implementation of this theoretical framework seems prob-
lematic. Nonetheless, if we recall that the risk premium associated with the additional
r0] is due to the lack of diversiﬁcation of the so-called “speciﬁc
term (γi −
risk,” and that well-diversiﬁed portfolios such that the equally-weighted portfolio are par-
ticularly sensitive to this risk, it seems natural to consider the return on this portfolio in
order to probe the market price of the non-diversiﬁed risk. Besides, the numerical simula-
tions presented in section 3.1 testify to the relevance of this choice. However, insofar as the
equally-weighted portfolio is (by construction) strongly correlated with the market portfolio,
it can be desirable to consider instead the arbitrage portfolio made of a long position in the
equally-weighted portfolio and of a short position in the market portfolio. This arbitrage
portfolio constitutes our proxy for the ICC risk factor and we denote by ricc(t) the time
series of its returns. Therefore, this reasoning applied to proposition 3 leads us to estimate
the following regression model

In order to assess the explaining power of the new factor, we also include in the regression
model the two factors SMB and HML of Fama and French (see Fama and French (1993)
for the description of the construction of these two portfolios). We use the monthly excess
returns of twenty-ﬁve equally-weighted portfolios sorted by the quintiles of the distribution of
sizes and book-to-market values and the returns of ten value-weighted and equally-weighted
industry portfolios15. Tables 2 to 7 present our results for the period from Jan. 1927 to Dec.
2005.

Table 2 presents the parameter estimates of the multi-linear time series regression of the
excess monthly returns of 25 equally-weighed portfolios (sorted by quintiles of the distribution
of sizes – Small, 2, 3, 4 and Big – and by quintiles of the distribution of Book equity to Market
equity ratio – Low, 2, 3, 4 and High) regressed on the excess return on the market portfolio,
on the two Fama-French factors SMB and HML and on the proxy ICC for the additional risk
factor due to the internal consistency constraint given by the diﬀerence between the return
on the equally-weighted portfolio and the return on the market portfolio:

The ﬁgures decorated by one star (resp. two stars) show the cases which reject the null
hypothesis that the factor under consideration is not signiﬁcant in the presence of the others
at the 5% (resp. the 1%) level. Clearly, the three factors SMB, HML and ICC are, almost
always, signiﬁcant at the 1% level, suggesting that it is a priori useful to consider these three
factors together. The regressions on the four factors provide a very good explanation of the
portfolios excess returns, as witnessed by the R2’s which are larger than, or of the order of,
90% for most portfolios, except for three extreme cases: Small-Low, Small-2 and Big-High.

However, these conclusions must be tempered in view of the results summarized in table 3
which gives the R2 of the various regressions of the multi-linear times series of the monthly
excess returns of these 25 equally-weighed portfolios on the market portfolio (Rm), on the
market portfolio and the factor ICC (ICC), on the market portfolio and the size factor (SMB),
on the market portfolio and the book to market factor (HML), on the market portfolio and
the two Fama&French factors (HML + SMB), on the market portfolio, the factor ICC and
the size factor (ICC + SMB), on the market portfolio, the factor ICC and the book to market
factor (ICC + HML) and, ﬁnally on all four factors (market, ICC, SMB and HML). The
numbers in boldface represent the maximum value of the R2 within the group of regression
with two factors (columns ICC, SMB and HML) and with three factors (columns HML +
SMB, ICC + SMB and ICC + HML) while the numbers within parenthesis provide the 95%
conﬁdence interval of the R2 obtained by bootstrap (Efron and Tibshirani 1993).

Several comments are in order. First, for the two-factor models – namely the regression
models which include the market factor and one of the factors ICC, SMB or HML – the
internal consistency factor ICC provides the best explanation in 11 cases out of 25. Second,
for the groups of portfolios within the ﬁrst three quintiles of the distribution of sizes, i.e,
Small, 2 and 3, the factor ICC provides the largest improvement in 10 cases out of 15.
Beside, the improvement provided by the factor ICC is particularly important for the group
of the ﬁve portfolios built on the ﬁrst quintile of the distribution of size (group “Small”)
with respect to both the size and the book-to-market factors. Third, based upon the 95%
conﬁdence intervals (ﬁgures within parenthesis) obtained by bootstrap, this improvement is
statistically signiﬁcant with respect to the regression on the sole market factor16 and also with
respect to the regression on the market portfolio and either the size or the book-to-market
factor in the group “Small”. In contrast, for portfolios belonging to the two last quintiles
of the distribution of size, i.e., portfolios of the group 4 and Big, the factor HML provides
the largest improvement 9 times out of 10 and is statistically signiﬁcant, with respect to the
regression on the sole market factor, for 8 of these portfolios.

For the three-factor models, the pair (SMB,HML) provides the best improvement in 13
cases out of 25, before the pair (ICC,HML) which is the best 8 times out of 25, while the
pair (SMB,ICC) wins the “horse race” only 4 times out of 25. However, these improvement
are statically signiﬁcant with respect to the best two-factor model (which is most often the
market + factor ICC) in only 5 cases out of 25, namely for the portfolios 2-4, 2-High; 3-4,
3-High; and 4-Low. Therefore, the usefulness of a three-factor model is clearly questionable.
To sum up our tests performed on the 25 equally-weighted portfolios ordered by quintiles
in size and book-to-market, we have found that, on average, the factor ICC alone provides the
best signiﬁcant improvement with respect to the market factor, and also provides a signiﬁcant
improvement with respect to the market factor and either the size or the book-to-market
factor. Overall, the addition of one or two of the Fama and French factors turns out to provide
only a marginal improvement. The conﬁdence intervals on the R2 obtained by bootstrap
suggests that a two-factor model (market portfolio + factor ICC) has almost the same
explanatory power than the three-factor Fama-French model, while being more parsimonious
and based on solid economic foundation. Beside, the signiﬁcance of the intercepts α’s remains
comparable (see the last two lines of Table 3). In all cases, the GRS test (Gibbons et al. 1989)
underlines that the intercept is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from zero. In this respect, the factor
ICC does not really improve on the two factors of Fama and French but, clearly, the GRS
statistics reaches its minimum when the size factor is replaced by the ICC factor. Therefore,
based on the results on the “Small” group of portfolios, on the GRS test and on our theoretical
approach, we can ﬁnally conclude to the superiority of the factor ICC with respect to the size
factor SMB. On the hand, the explaining power of the book-to-market factor HML seems
undisputable even if it is weakened in the presence of ICC.

[Insert Tables 4 and 5 about here]

16Note that, a priori, the quoted R2 of the linear models are not directly comparable since they involve diﬀerent
numbers of parameters. In principle, it is thus necessary to use the adjusted-R2 instead of the raw R2. However,
the large number of data points (948) makes the diﬀerence between these two quantities irrelevant at the level of
precision of the ﬁrst decimal place.

The following tables provide the same statistics for value-weighted and equally-weighted
industry portfolios which conﬁrm the previous conclusions. Table 4 presents the parameter
estimates of the multi-linear time series regression of the excess monthly returns of 10 value-
weighed industry portfolios regressed, as in table 2, on the excess return on the market
portfolio, on the two Fama-French factors and on the factor ICC. In the presence of the risk
factor ICC, the factor SMB turns out to be not signiﬁcant for most portfolios (7 cases out of
10). Conversely, in the presence the factor SMB, the factor ICC has no explanatory power
in only 4 cases out of 10. This clearly conﬁrms that, overall, ICC is a superior substitute
to SMB. For the HML factor, the table shows that this factor is always signiﬁcant, even in
the presence of the factor ICC. Again, these observations must be tempered by the results
of table 5 which provides the R2 of the various multi-linear times series regressions of the
monthly excess returns of these 10 value-weighed industry portfolios on the same set of
factors as in table 3.
It is striking to observe that, on the basis of the 95% conﬁdence
intervals obtained by bootstrap, none of the factors ICC, SMB and HML or any combination
thereof, is able to provide a signiﬁcant improvement with respect to the regression on the sole
market factor (with the exception of the portfolio “Others”). Concerning the factor ICC,
this observation is not a big surprise since it is expected to provide a strong explanatory
power for well-diversiﬁed portfolios. But, by construction, value-weighted portfolios are not
diversiﬁed, hence the lack of explanatory power of the factor ICC. Moreover, if the number
of assets in each industry is large enough, we should expect that the contribution of the
residual risk to the total risk goes to zero, as it goes to zero for the market portfolio.

[Insert Tables 6 and 7 about here]

The situation is totally diﬀerent when one considers the same set of industry portfo-
lios but constructed on an equally-weighted basis. In this case, each industry portfolio is
“well-diversiﬁed,” in the sense that the weight of each asset in a given industry portfolio is
inversely proportional to the number of assets in this portfolio. Tables 6 and 7 summarize
the values of the parameter estimates and of the R2, respectively, of the multi-linear time
series regressions of the excess monthly returns on 10 equally-weighed industry portfolios re-
gressed, as previously, on the excess return on the market portfolio, on the two Fama-French
factors and on the factor ICC, on the one hand, and on the same set of factors as in tables 3
and 5, on the other hand. As in the case of the 25 equally-weighted portfolios sorted by size
and book-to-market, the addition of the internal consistency factor ICC to the market factor
provides overall the best improvement in terms of the R2 of two-factor models. In addition,
no three- or four-factor model provides a statistically signiﬁcant improvement while the GRS
test does not reject the hypothesis of a zero-intercept for the model “Market factor + ICC
factor” at the 2% level.

This conﬁrms that the two-factor model constructed with the market portfolio and with
the internal consistency factor ICC has overall the same explanatory power as the three-factor
Fama-French model.

3.4 Relation between the internal consistency factor ICC and the
two Fama and French factors SMB and HML

As illustrated above, the additional internal consistency factor allows us to explain several
well-known pricing anomalies, with a power comparable to the HML + SMB Fama-French
factors. We now discuss why this can be expected on the basis of our theoretical results.
Speciﬁcally, starting from our theoretical framework, we address the question of why should
the two additional factors of Fama and French have an explaining power, that is, what could
be the origins of the size and book-to-market eﬀects.

The size eﬀect. The size eﬀect is well-known to generally explain the part of the cross-
section of expected returns left unexplained by any misspeciﬁed asset pricing model (Berk
1995), which raises the question of its relevance as the signature of a genuine risk factor.
Our theoretical model provides an answer to this question by rationalizing the role of the
size eﬀect as providing a proxy for the diversiﬁcation factor f (or ICC). Indeed, since the

21

arbitrage portfolio which proxies the ICC factor is long in the equally-weighted portfolio and
short in the market portfolio, it is therefore long on the small caps and short on the large
caps, just like the SMB portfolio. There is thus no qualitative diﬀerence between the Fama
and French’s factor SMB and our proxy of the ICC factor. This is conﬁrmed by the large
value of the linear correlation between the two portfolios proxying the SMB and ICC factors
equal to 86% over the time interval studied here. As an illustration, the return on each
factors is depicted on the left panel of ﬁgure 3 while the right panel represents the value of
$1 invested in the market portfolio in Jan. 1927 and the value of a leveraged position of $1
invested in SMB and ICC in Jan. 1927.

[Insert ﬁgure 3 about here]

The book-to-market eﬀect. As illustrated by Stattman (1980) and Rosenberg et al.
(1985) in the early eighties and as emphasized more recently by Fama and French (1992,
1993), stocks with a high book-to-market value tend to overperform stocks with a low book-
to-market value. Several economic explanations have been proposed to justify this phe-
nomenon. Among others, Fama and French have proposed that value stocks are companies
that are in ﬁnancial distress while Campbell and Vuolteenoha (2004) have suggested that
growth stocks might have speculative investment opportunities that will be proﬁtable only
if equity ﬁnancing is available on suﬃciently good terms.

The pricing formula provided by proposition 3 oﬀers a straightforward justiﬁcation of the
book-to-market eﬀect. Indeed, there is good empirical evidence that high book-to-market
stocks have signiﬁcantly lower beta’s with respect to the market portfolio compared with
low book-to-market stocks. For instance, using a large sample of ﬁrms from 1977 to 2004,
Bernardo et al. (2007) ﬁnd that the diﬀerence between the beta’s of growth opportunities
and the beta’s of assets-in-place is positive and statistically signiﬁcant, at the 95% level, in 34
out of 37 industry classiﬁcations. Bernardo et al. suggest that this results from the fact that,
since ﬁrms with more growth opportunities have cash ﬂows with longer duration, their values
are more sensitive to changes in interest rates and thus should have higher beta’s. Then,
r0] introduced by the internal
γm ·
ceteris paribus, the additional term (γi −
consistency constraint leads to a higher expected rate of return for a stock with a low beta
if the term γm is positive.

4 Conclusion

Starting from a factorial model in which the only a priori systematic risk is the market port-
folio, we have shown that there is a new source of signiﬁcant systematic risk, which has been
totally neglected up to now but which ought to be priced by the market. This occurs when
(i) the internal consistency condition holds (which simply means that the market portfolio
is constituted of the assets whose returns it is supposed to explain) and (ii) the distribution
of the capitalization of ﬁrms is suﬃciently fat-tailed, as is the case of real economies. The
corresponding new internal consistent factors do not disappear for arbitrary large economies
because the contribution, to the risk of arbitrary well-diversiﬁed portfolios due to the largest
ﬁrms, remains ﬁnite for arbitrary large economies when the distribution of the capitalization
of ﬁrms is suﬃciently heavy-tailed. For this reason, this endogenous factor can be consid-
ered as related to the existence of a diversiﬁcation/concentration premium resulting from
the concern of investors with respect to the level of diversiﬁcation of their portfolio in so far
as holding the market portfolio alone does not allow for a good diversiﬁcation.

Applied to the Arbitrage Pricing Theory, we have shown that the original derivation of
Ross’ results still holds, provided that we explicitly include the additional diversiﬁcation
factor in the analysis. As a consequence, this factor is shown to provide possible theoretical
economic explanations of some of the empirical factors reported in the literature. In par-
ticular, it allows understanding the superior performance of Fama and French three-factor
model in explaining the cross section of stock returns. Indeed, the diversiﬁcation factor pro-
vides a rationalization of the SMB factor as a proxy of this factor. Beside, being consistent
with the fact that high book-to-market stocks have signiﬁcantly lower beta’s with respect to

22

the market portfolio compared with low book-to-market stocks, the Value/Growth eﬀect is
related to the increasing sensitivity of value stocks to the diversiﬁcation factor. Finally, on
the basis of only two factors (the market portfolio and the equally-weighted portfolio), our
model turns out to be at least as successful as the Fama and French three-factor model in
explaining the cross-section of monthly returns on US stock over the time period for Jan.
1927 to Dec 2005.

excess return on the market portfolio, on the two Fama-French factors SMB and HML and on
the proxy for the additional risk factor due to the internal consistency constraint given by the
diﬀerence between the return on the equally-weighted portfolio and the return on the market
portfolio:

In the four columns labeled β, βSM B, βHM L and βICC the ﬁgures decorated by one star (resp.
two stars) show the cases which reject the null hypothesis that the factor under consideration
is not signiﬁcant in the presence of the others at the 5% (resp. the 1%) level. For instance, for
the portfolio Big-High, the factor SMB is not signiﬁcant (neither at the 5% nor the 1% level)
in the presence of both the market factor, the factor HML and the proxy for the factor ICC.
Similarly, the factor ICC is not signiﬁcant in the presence of the market factor, the SMB and
HML factors while, in contrast, the factor HML is still signiﬁcant at the 1% level in the presence
of the market factor, the the SMB and ICC factors.

R2 of the linear regression of the excess returns of 25 equally-weighed portfolios (sorted by quintiles of the distribution of size – Small, 2, 3, 4
and Big – and by quintiles of the distribution of Book equity to Market equity ratio – Low, 2, 3, 4 and High) on the market portfolio (Rm),
on the market portfolio and the factor ICC (ICC), on the market portfolio and the size factor (SMB), on the market portfolio and the book to
market factor (HML), on the market portfolio and the two Fama&French factors (HML + SMB), on the market portfolio, the factor ICC and
the size factor (ICC + SMB), on the market portfolio, the factor ICC and the book to market factor (ICC + HML) and, ﬁnally on all these four
factors (Market, ICC, SMB and HML). Figures in boldface represent the maximum value of the R2 within the group of regression with two factors
(columns ICC, SMB and HML) and with three factors (columns HML + SMB, ICC + SMB and ICC + HML). The two last rows reports Gibbons

Multi-factor time series regressions for monthly excess returns on 10

Parameter estimates of the linear regression of the excess returns of ten value-weighed industry
portfolios regressed on the excess return on the market portfolio, on the two Fama-French factors
SMB and HML and on the proxy for the additional risk factor due to the internal consistency
constraint given by the diﬀerence between the return on the equally-weighted portfolio and the

In the four columns labeled β, βSM B, βHM L and βICC, the ﬁgures decorated by one star (resp.
two stars) show the cases which reject the null hypothesis that the factor under consideration is
not signiﬁcant in the presence of the others at the 5% (resp. the 1%) level. For instance, for the
Shops, the Health and the Utilities industries, the factor SMB is not signiﬁcant (neither at the
5% nor the 1% level) in the presence of both the market factor, the factor HML and the proxy
for the factor ICC. Similarly, for the same industry portfolio, the factor ICC is not signiﬁcant
in the presence of the market factor and the SMB and HML factors.

Multi-factor time series regressions for monthly excess returns on 10

Parameter estimates of the linear regression of the excess returns of ten equally-weighed industry
portfolios regressed on the excess return on the market portfolio, on the two Fama-French factors
SMB and HML and on the proxy for the additional risk factor due to the internal consistency
constraint given by the diﬀerence between the return on the equally-weighted portfolio and the
return on the market portfolio:

Table 7
Multi-factor time series regressions for monthly excess returns on 10 equally-weighted industry portfolios (R2):
Jan. 1927 - Dec. 2005, 948 months

R2 of the linear regression of the excess returns of ten equally-weighed industry portfolios regressed on the (excess return) on the market portfolio
(Rm), on the market portfolio and the factor ICC (ICC), on the market portfolio and the size factor (SMB), on the market portfolio and the
book to market factor (HML), on the market portfolio and the two Fama&French factors (HML + SMB), on the market portfolio, the factor ICC
and the size factor (ICC + SMB), on the market portfolio, the factor ICC and the book to market factor (ICC + HML) and, ﬁnally on the four
factors (market, ICC, SMB and HML). Figures in boldface represent the maximum value of the R2 within the group of regression with two factors
(columns ICC, SMB and HML) and with three factors (columns HML + SMB, ICC + SMB and ICC + HML). The two last rows reports Gibbons
et al. (1989) test statistics and p-values.

Figure 3. Comparison of ICC and SMB. The upper panel shows the return
of the factor SMB versus the return of the factor ICC. The straight line shows the
regression line with equation y =
x. The lower panel depicts
the value of $1 invested in the market portfolio in Jan. 1927 (grey curve; green
online) and the value of a leveraged position of $1 invested in SMB (dark grey curve;
blue online) and ICC (black curve; red online) in Jan. 1927. For the two arbitrage
portfolios SMB and ICC, the initial endowment of $1 can be thought of as a reserve
to ensure against risk losses, from which the returns can be discounted to provide
the shown wealth curves.

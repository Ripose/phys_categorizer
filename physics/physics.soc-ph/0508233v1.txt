In this paper, we analyze web-downloaded data on people sharing their music library, that we
use as their individual musical signatures (IMS). The system is represented by a bipartite network,
nodes being the music groups and the listeners. Music groups audience size behaves like a power
law, but the individual music library size is an exponential with deviations at small values.
In
order to extract structures from the network, we focus on correlation matrices, that we ﬁlter by
removing the least correlated links. This percolation idea-based method reveals the emergence of
social communities and music genres, that are visualised by a branching representation. Evidence
of collective listening habits that do not ﬁt the neat usual genres deﬁned by the music industry
indicates an alternative way of classifying listeners/music groups. The structure of the network is
also studied by a more reﬁned method, based upon a random walk exploration of its properties.
Finally, a personal identiﬁcation - community imitation model (PICI) for growing bipartite networks
is outlined, following Potts ingredients. Simulation results do reproduce quite well the empirical
data.

INTRODUCTION

Answering a common question such as ”What kind of
music do you listen to?” is not an easy task and is full
of hidden informations about oneself. Indeed, music is
omnipresent in our society and is part of everyday life.
Moreover, it is well-known in social sciences [1] that music
does not function merely as entertainment, but is deeply
related to identity-building and community-building. In
that sense, personal musical choices derive from a subtle
interplay between cultural framework inheritance, social
recognition and personality identiﬁcation. These rein-
force one’s self-image and send messages to others [2].
Due to the complexity of taste formation and the rich-
ness of available music, it is tempting to postulate that
someone’s music library is a unique signature of himself
[3]. For instance, it is interesting to point to the empir-
ical study by D’Arcangelo [4] which shows that listeners
strongly identify with their musical choice, some even go-
ing so far as to equate their music collection with their
personality: My personality goes in my iPod, as an in-
terviewed person claims. Consequently, it is diﬃcult for
people to recognise themselves in usual music divisions,
such as punkers versus metal heads, or jazz versus pop
listeners. And, more commonly, they answer to the above
question ”Everything... a little bit of everything”.

Recently attempts have been made to characterise the
musical behaviour of individuals and groups using meth-
ods from quantitative sociology and social network anal-
ysis. These attempts were made possible because of the
huge amount of music databases available now, associ-

ated with the current transition from materialised mu-
sic (LP’s, CD’s...)
to computer-based listening habits
(iTunes, iPod...). Amongst other studies, let us cite the
recent empirical work by Voida et al.
[5], which shows
that people form judgements about colleagues based on
the taste - or lack of taste - revealed by their music col-
lection, and admit to tailoring their own music library to
project a particular person.

The present paper focuses on these musical behaviours
from a statistical physics and statistical point of view,
by analysing individual musical signatures and extract-
ing collective trends. This issue is part of the intense
ongoing physicist research activity on opinion formation
[6, 7, 8, 9, 10], itself related to phase transitions and
self organisation on networks [11, 12], including clique
formation [13]. The characteristics of such phenomena
depend on the type of network, as well as on the data
size, thereby questioning universality, in contrast with
Statistical Mechanics.

In section 2, we extract empirical data from collabora-
tive ﬁltering websites, e.g. audioscrobbler.com and mu-
sicmobs.com. These sites possess huge databases, that
characterise the listening habits of their users, and allow
these users to discover new music. Our analysis consists
in applying methods from complex network theory [14]
in order to characterise the musical signatures of a large
number of individuals. In section 3, we present original
percolation idea-based (PIB) methods in order to visu-
alise the collective behaviours. We also probe the reality
of the usual music divisions, e.g.
rock, alternative &
punk, classical, and propose a quantitative way to deﬁne
more reﬁned musical subdivisions. These sub-divisions,
that are not based upon usual standards but rather upon
the intrinsic structure of the audience, may lead to the
usual music genres in some particular case, but also reveal
unexpected collective listening habits. Let us note that

other techniques may also lead to an objective classiﬁca-
tion of music, e.g. by characterising their time correlation

properties [15].
ori unknown collective behaviours is a diﬃcult task [16],
and of primordial importance in the structural and func-
tional properties of various networked systems, e.g. pro-
teins [17], industrial sectors [18], groups of people [19]...
Consequently, we also use another method in section 4
in order to uncover these structures, i.e. the percolated
island structure is explored by randomly walking (RW)
the network, and by studying the properties of the RW
with standard statistical tools. Finally, in section 5, we
present a growing network model, whose ingredients are
very general, i.e. personal identiﬁcation and community
imitation (PICI). The model reproduces the observed de-
gree (number of links per node) distributions of the net-
works as well as its internal correlations.

II. METHODOLOGY

Recently new kinds of websites have been dedicated
to the sharing of musical habits. These sites allow
ﬁrst members to upload their music libraries, previously
stocked on their computers, towards a central server, and
next to create a web page containing this list of music
groups. Additionally, the website proposes the users to
discover new music by comparing their taste with that of
other users. These methods of making automatic predic-
tions for the interests of a user by collecting information
from many (collaborating) users is usually called Col-
laborative Filtering [20]. The data that we analyse here
has been downloaded from audioscrobbler.com in January
2005. It consists of a listing of users (each represented
by a number), together with the list of music groups the
users own in their library. This structure directly leads
to a bipartite network for the whole system. Namely, it
is a network composed by two kinds of nodes, i.e. the
persons, called users or listeners in the following, and
the music groups. The network can be represented by a
graph with edges running between a group i and a user
µ, if µ owns i.

In the original data set, there are 617900 diﬀerent mu-
sic groups, although this value is skewed due to mul-
tiple (even erroneous) ways for a user to characterise
an artist (e.g. Mozart, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and
Wolfgang Amedeus Mozart count as three music groups)
and 35916 users. There are 5028580 links in the bipar-
tite graph, meaning that, on average, each user owns
140 music groups in his/her library, while each group is
owned by 8 persons. For completeness, let us note that
the listener with the most groups possesses 4072 groups
(0.6% of the total music library) while the group with the
largest audience, Radiohead, has 10194 users (28% of the
user community). This asymmetry in the bipartite net-
work is expected as users have in general speciﬁc tastes
that prevent them from listening to any kind of music,
while there exist mainstream groups that are listened to

2

by a very large audience. This asymmetry is also observ-
able in the degree distributions for the people and for the
groups. The former distribution (see Fig.1) is ﬁtted re-
spectively with an exponential e− n
150 for large n and the
latter is a power-law n−1.8, where n is the number of links
per node, i.e. nG or nL for groups and listeners respec-
tively. Let us stress that such distributions are common
in complex networks [21]. For instance, co-authorship
networks also exhibit a bipartite asymmetry, and power
law distribution n−α, with α ∼ 2 [22].

Finally, let us mention the top ten groups in hierarchi-
cal order: Radiohead, Nirvana, ColdPlay, Metallica, The
Beatles, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Pink Floyd, Green Day,
Weezer and Linkin Park. Obviously, the examined sam-
ple is oriented toward recent rock music. This fact has to
be kept in mind, as it determines the mainstream music
trend in the present sample, and could be a constraint
on expected universality. This is left for further studies.
A common way to represent and to study bipartite net-
works consists in projecting them onto links of one kind
[23]. The standard projection method simpliﬁes the sys-
tem to a unipartite network, where nodes are e.g. the lis-
teners and where two listeners are connected if they have
at least one music group in common. This scheme, that
leads to a helpful representation in the case of collabo-
ration networks [24, 25], is unfortunately meaningless in
the case under study.
Indeed, due to the existence of
mainstream music groups, the unipartite network is al-
most fully connected, i.e. most of the listeners are linked
in the unipartite representation. For instance, Radio-
head fully connects 28% of the user community whatever
the rest of their music library contents. This projection
method deﬁnitely leads to an oversimpliﬁed and useless
representation. We reﬁne it by focusing on correlations
between the users libraries. To do so, we deﬁne for each
listener µ the nG-vector σµ:

σµ = (..., 1, ..., 0, ..., 1, ...)

(1)

where nG = 617900 is the total number of groups in
the system, µ ∈ [1, 35916] and where σµ
i = 1 if µ owns
group i and σµ
i = 0 otherwise. This vector is used as the
individual musical signature (IMS), as mentioned in the
introduction.

In the following, we make a selection in the total num-
ber of users for computational reasons. To do so, we have
analysed a subset of nP = 3806 persons having a num-
ber of groups between [115, 165], -see Fig.3, i.e. around
the average value 140.
In order to quantify the corre-
lations between two persons µ and λ, we introduce the
symmetric correlation measure:

Cµλ =

σµ.σλ
|σµ||σλ|

≡ cos θµλ

(2)

where σµ.σλ denotes the scalar product between the two
nG-vector, and || its associated norm. This correlation
measure, that corresponds to the cosine of the two vectors
in the nG-dimensional space, vanishes when the persons

have no common music groups, and is equal to 1 when
their music libraries are strictly identical.

At this level, the search for social communities requires
therefore the analysis of the nP × nP correlation matrix
Cµλ. A ﬁrst relevant quantity is the distribution of the
matrix elements Cµλ that statistically characterises the
correlations between listeners. Empirical results show a
rapid exponential decrease of the correlation distribution
(Fig.2), that we ﬁt with 31e−31C, so that people in the
sample are clearly discriminated by their music taste, i.e.
they are characterised by non-parrallel vectors. This jus-
tiﬁes the use of his/her music library as a unique IMS of
the listener.

nents [26], that are peninsulas, i.e. portions of the net-
work that are almost disconnected from the main clus-
ter, themselves connected by inter-community individu-
als. Further increasing the ﬁltering coeﬃcient value leads
to a removal of these inter-community individuals, and
to the shaping of well-deﬁned islands, completely discon-
nected from the main island. Let us stress that this sys-
tematic removal of links is directly related to percolation
theory. It is therefore interesting to focus on the inﬂu-
ence of the network structuring along percolation tran-
sition ideas. To do so, we compare the bifurcation dia-
gram of the empirical data with that obtained for a ran-
domised matrix, i.e. a matrix constructed by a random
re-disposition of the elements Cµλ. As shown in Fig.4a,
the correlated structure of the network broadens the in-
terval of the transition as compared to the uncorrelated
case. Moreover, the correlations also seem to displace
the location of the bifurcation, by requiring more links in
order to observe the percolation transition. This feature
may originate from community structuring that restrains
network exploration as compared to random structures
[28].

As a ﬁrst approximation, we restrict the scope to the
formation of islands in the matrix analysis, i.e. to the
simplest organised structures. From now on, we there-
fore associate the breaking of an island into sub-islands
to the emergence of a new sub-community, and, pursu-
ing the analogy, we call the largest connected structure
the mainstream community. Before going further, let us
stress that the projection method described above is ex-
actly equivalent to that of [23] when φ = 0.

In the following, we use a branching representation
of the community structuring (see Fig.5 for the sketch
of three ﬁrst steps of an arbitrary example). To do so,
we start the procedure with the lowest value of φ, here
φ = 0.2, and we represent each isolated island by a square
whose surface is proportional to its number of listeners.
Then, we increase slightly the value of φ, e.g. by 0.01,
and we repeat the procedure. From one step to the next
step, we draw a bond between emerging sub-islands and
their parent island. The ﬁlter is increased until all bonds
between nodes are eroded (that is, there is only one node
left in each island). Applied to the above correlation ma-
trix Cµλ (Fig.6), this representation leads to a compact
description of the series of graphs as those found in Fig.3.
Moreover, the snake structure gives some insight into the
diversiﬁcation process by following branches from their
source toward their extremity. The longer a given branch
is followed, the more likely it is forming a well-deﬁned
community.

In order to focus on collective eﬀects, we have stud-
ied in detail the behaviour of the clustering coeﬃcient
[23], that is a measure of the density of triangles in a
network, a triangle being formed every time two of one
node’s neighbours are related between them. This quan-
tity is a common way to measure social eﬀects in complex
networks, and measures, roughly speaking, whether the
friend of a friend is a friend. In ﬁgure 4b, we plot the

lation matrix for 3 values of the ﬁlter parameter φ = 0.275,
φ = 0.325 and φ = 0.35, displayed from top to bottom. The
graphs were plotted thanks to the visone graphical tools [27].

f = 1 if Cµλ > φ, and let Cµλ

otherwise. In ﬁgure 3, we show the graph representation
of the ﬁltered matrix for increasing values of φ. For the
sake of clarity, we have only depicted the individuals that
are related to at least one person, i.e. lonely persons are
self-excluded from the network structure, whence from
any community. One observes that, starting from a fully
connected network, increasing values of the ﬁltering co-
eﬃcient remove less correlated links and lead to the for-
mation of communities. These communities ﬁrst occur
through the development of strongly connected compo-

At each increasing step (t=0,1,2) of the ﬁlter φ, links are
removed, so that the network decomposes into isolated is-
lands. Theses islands are represented by squares, whose size
depends on the number of nodes in the island. Starting from
the largest island, branches indicate a parent relation between
the islands. The increasing ﬁlter method is applied until all

dependence of this quantity C vs. the ﬁltering coeﬃcient
φ. Moreover, in order to highlight the eﬀects of corre-
lations, we compare the results with those obtained for
the above randomised matrix. Our analysis shows a very
high value of C, almost φ independent for the original
matrix. This suggests that the way people acquire their
music taste is a highly social mechanism, likely related
to its identiﬁcation role as described in the introduction.

B. A Typical individual Music Signature

Before focusing on the genre-ﬁcation of music groups,
we give here, as an empirical example, the music library
of one person. This list is intended to indicate the di-
versity of groups that characterise a listener, as well as
his/her community. We write in bold the music groups
that are common to his/her sub-community, found by
the PIB technique, and in normal characters those that
are owned only by the individual. There are 117 diﬀerent
music groups.

Obviously, this person belongs to a music community
characterised by a mixture of the usual music genres, in-
cluding Pop/Rock, 80’s Pop, Electro, Alternative... This
eclecticism indicates the inadequacy of such music subdi-
visions to characterise individual and collective listening
habits.

C. Music groups network

In view of the above, it is interesting to introduce a
new way to build music sub-divisions, i.e. based upon
the listening habits of their audience. To do so, we have
applied the PIB approach to a sample composed of the
top 5,000 most-owned groups. This limited choice was
motivated by the possibility to identify these groups at
ﬁrst sight. Each music group is characterised by its sig-
nature, that is a vector:

γi = (..., 1, ..., 0, ..., 1, ...)

(3)

of nL components, where nL = 35916 is the total number
of users in the system, and where γi
µ = 1 if the listener
µ owns group i and γi
µ = 0 otherwise. By doing so, we
consider that the audience of a music group, i.e. the list
of persons listening to it, identiﬁes its signature, as we
assume that the music library characterises that of an
individual.

The next step consists in projecting the bipartite net-
work onto a unipartite network of music groups. To do so,
we build the correlation matrix for the music groups as
before, and ﬁlter it with increasing values of the ﬁltering
coeﬃcient. As previously, the action of ﬁltering erodes
the nodes, thereby revealing a structured percolated is-
land (Fig. 7) that breaks into small islands. The result-
ing tree representation of the correlation matrix (Fig. 6)
shows clearly long persisting branches, thereby suggest-
ing a high-degree of common listenership. Poring over the
branches of the top 5000 tree [29], we ﬁnd many stan-
dard, homogenous style groupings. Amongst these ho-
mogeneous cliques, there are [George Strait, Faith Hill, Garth
Brooks, Clint Black, Kenny Chesney, Shania Twain, Alan Jack-
son, Martina McBride, Alabama, Tim McGraw, Reba McEntire,
Diamond Rio, John Michael Montgomery, SheDaisy, Brooks and

well as its direction are irrelevant. In the lower ﬁgure, branch-

groupings respectively.

In contrast, many of the islands are harder to ex-
plain from a standard genre-ﬁcation point of view.
In
some cases, the island may be homogeneous in one music
style, but show some unexpected elements, like: [Spain In
My Heart (Various), The Pogues, Dave Brubeck Quartet, Crosby,
Stills, Nash and Young, Phil Ochs, Billy Bragg, Clem Snide, Sarah
Harmer, Mason Jennings, Kirsty MacColl, tullycraft, Ibrahim
Ferrer, Sarah Slean, Penguin Cafe Orchestra, Pretenders, Joe
Strummer and The Mescaleros, Freezepop] that is a folk/folk
cluster, with odd members like the Brubeck Jazz Band,
for example. But other groupings defy monolithic style
categorization, like: [The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, Yello,
Galaxie 500, Prince and the Revolution, Ultra Bra, Uriah Heep,
Laurent Garnier], [Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, Orb, Zero
7, Royksopp, Stan Getz]. The latter include unexpected
mixtures of Indie Rock/Funk/Hard Rock/Dance, and
Folk/Electro/Jazz respectively.

Consequently, the PIB approach reveals evidence of
unexpected collective listening habits, thereby uncover-
ing trends in music. As a matter of fact, these anoma-
lous entities have been shared by multiple listeners. This
seems to conﬁrm the role of collective listening habits in
the individual building of music taste.
It is important
to note that the PIB method neglects the relevance of
the main island structuring by identifying ”music gen-
res”/”listener communities” with isolated islands. It is
obviously a drastic simpliﬁcation that may lead to the
neglect of pertinent structures, and therefore requests a
more detailed exploration of the network structure.

IV. RANDOM WALK EXPLORATION

In this section, we consider an alternative method for
revealing the internal structures of the network. The
method is based on a random walking exploration of the
percolated island. The random walk (RW) starts at some
node, i.e. the initial node. At each time step, we choose
randomly one of its links, and move the walker to the
connected node. Moreover, we keep track of the distance
from the occupied node to the original node d0i as a func-
tion of time i. By deﬁnition, the distance between two
nodes is the length of the smallest path between them.
The initial node is chosen to be the central node of the
percolated island, namely the node c that minimises the
average distance with other nodes in the island:

< d >=

where nI is the number of nodes in the island.

In the following, we focus on the percolated island of
ﬁgure 7, that is composed of nI = 247 nodes, and 4406
links. The percolated island clearly exhibits penininsu-
lae, that link alike music groups. For instance, the cluster

percolated island, that is obviously composed of guitar heroes,
e.g. B.B. King, S.R. Vaughan, A.D. Meola... Let us also note
that S.R. Vaughan appears through two diﬀerent ways that
are linked by our analysis.

in the centre of the ﬁgure is ”hard rock” oriented, with
music groups like The killing tree, Unearth, Murder by
Death... This is also illustrated in the lower graph of
ﬁgure 7, where we zoom on a small structure that en-
compasses guitar heroes, e.g. B.B. King, S.R. Vaughan,
A.D. Meola, G. Benson... In the case under study, the
central node is the music group Murder by Death, that is
located in the hard rock cluster.

lated to the subjacent path geometry, seems to indicate
the existence of diﬀerent time-scales, associated with the
large-scale structures in the network. In order to analyse
the time series, we have focused on the probability of re-
turn toward the initial node. To do so, we have measured
the time intervals τ between two passages of the walker
on the initial node, and calculated the distribution f (τ )
of these time intervals. Moreover, in order to study the
rare events associated to the tail of the distribution, we
∞
t f (τ )dτ . By con-
focus on the risk function R(t) = R
struction R(0) = 1 and R(∞) = 0. The results, that
are plotted in ﬁgure 8b, clearly reveal two time scales:
a rapid time scale (80 time steps) that determines the
internal dynamics in one cluster; a slow time scale (2200
time steps) that characterises the passage from one clus-
ter to another one. Let us stress that detrended ﬂuctua-
tion analysis of the random walk [30] leads to the same
conclusion.

V. PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION -
COMMUNITY IMITATION MODEL

i.e.

The empirical results of the previous section suggest
that a person’s musical taste derives from an interplay
between Personal Identiﬁcation, i.e. his/her individual
choice, and Community Imitation,
the collective
trend. In order to test this assumption, we introduce the
PICI model where personal music libraries build through
two processes. On one hand, collective eﬀects, originating
from social interactions between individuals, are mim-
icked by an exchange of music groups between similar
individuals.
In order to deﬁne this similitude between
two persons, we compare their music libraries, and favour
the pair interactions between people having alike music
taste, as in a Potts model [31]. On the other hand, there
are individual mechanisms that push people to distin-
guish themselves from their community. We model such
a dynamics by individual random choices. We neglect
the eﬀect of an external ﬁeld, like advertising, on an in-
dividual behaviour. Moreover, in order to reproduce the
observed degree distributions of the bipartite graph [22],
we assume that the networks are growing in time. This
is done in a way that music groups are chosen with pref-
erential attachment [14], i.e. with a probability simply
proportional to their audience.

These requirements are put into form as follows. The
system is composed by L(t) users and M (t) music groups,
that are initially randomly linked. At each (Monte Carlo)
time step, three processes may occur:

(i) A new user may enter the system, with probability
pI . His/her library contains one music group, chosen
randomly in the set of previous groups with preferential
attachment.

(ii) A randomly picked user adds a new music group to
the library, with probability pN . This new group appends
to the collection of available music in the system.

(cos θµλ

(iii) Two randomly chosen users exchange their mu-
sic knowledge, with probability pE. The pair is selected
, where θµλ
with a probability proportional to e
is the angle between the vectors of their music libraries
(Eq.1), deﬁned by their cosine (Eq.2); the temperature
T is a parameter that represents the ability of qualita-
tively diﬀerent communities to mix together. If the pair
is selected, we compare the two music libraries, and give
to each user a fraction of the unknown groups of his/her
partner. Let us stress that this rule ensures preferential
attachment for the music groups.

Some representative results of the simulations obtained
from the model are selectively shown in Fig.9, for a typ-
ical simulation set, with pI = 0.02, pN = 0.03, pE = 0.03
and T = 0.13. A complete analysis of the PICI model
phase space variables and the dynamics will be presented
elsewhere. The simulations were stopped after 200 time
steps/node, in a system composed by 22800 users, 15126
music groups and 442666 links.

The degree distributions of the bipartite graph are de-
picted in Fig.9. The results reproduce quite well the
exponential and the power-law features experimentally
found (Fig.1). For the group distribution, the exponent
is close to the empirical value 1.8. Moreover, diﬀerent
simulations show that this value remains in the vicinity
of 2 for a large set of the parameters.

For the user distribution, simulations also reproduce
the deviations from the exponential for small number
of groups nG, as observed in Fig.1. We have noticed
(unshown) that these deviations diminish for increasing
values of T . This uncovers that the self-organising mech-
anisms associated to community structuring are respon-
sible for the extreme deviations.

The dependence of the clustering coeﬃcient C on the
ﬁltering coeﬃcient has also been considered. It is found
that the she simulations reproduce qualitatively well the
almost constant high value of C found in Fig.4. How-
ever this behaviour ceases to be observed for large values
of the temperature, i.e.
in systems where collective ef-
fects do not develop by construction of the model. This
seems to conﬁrm the crucial competing roles played by
individual choices and community inﬂuence in order to
reproduce the observed data.

VI. CONCLUSION

In this article, we study empirically the musical be-
haviours of a large sample of persons. Our analysis is
based on complex network techniques, and leads to the
uncovering of individual and collective trends from the
data. To do so, we use two methods. On one hand, we use
percolation idea-based techniques that consist in ﬁltering
correlation matrices, i.e.
correlations between the lis-
teners/music groups. Moreover, the communities/music
genres are visualised by a branching representation. On
the other hand, we explore the structure of the main
percolated island by randomly walking the network. The

goal is to map its internal structure and correlations onto
a time series, that we analyse with standard statistical
tools.

The method allows to reveal non-trivial connections
between the listeners/music groups. It is shown that if
some empirical sub-divisions respect the standard genre
classiﬁcation, many sub-divisions are harder to explain
from a standard genre-ﬁcation point of view. These col-
lective listening habits, that do not ﬁt the neat usual
genres deﬁned by the music industry, represent the
non-conventional taste of listeners. They could there-
fore be an alternative objective way to classify music
groups. These collective genre-hopping habits also sug-
gest a growing eclecticism of music listeners [29], that is
driven by curiosity and self-identiﬁcation, in opposition
to the uniform trends promoted by commercial radios
and M ajor record labels [32].

Whence, we introduce a simple grow model, that repro-
duces quite well the results obtained from the empirical
data, i.e. the observed degree distributions of the net-
works. It is important to point out that the ingredients
of the model are very general, i.e. imply competition be-

10

tween personal identiﬁcation and community imitation
(PICI). Consequently, PICI should apply to a larger va-
riety of systems than the music networks hereby investi-
gated, but also to other networks such as collaboration
networks in science [22]. In a statistical physics sense, the
model contains Potts model-like ingredients for opinion
and taste formation.

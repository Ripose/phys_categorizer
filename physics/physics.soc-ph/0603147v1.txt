Abstract

We study dynamical behavior of the Chinese stock markets by investigating the
statistical properties of daily ensemble returns and varieties deﬁned respectively
as the mean and the standard deviation of the ensemble daily price returns of a
portfolio of stocks traded in China’s stock markets on a given day. The distribution
of the daily ensemble returns has an exponential form in the center and power-law
tails, while the variety distribution is log-Gaussian in the bulk followed by a power-
law tail for large varieties. Based on detrended ﬂuctuation analysis, R/S analysis
and modiﬁed R/S analysis, we ﬁnd evidence of long memory in the ensemble returns
and strong evidence of long memory in the evolution of variety.

1 Introduction

Financial markets are complex systems, in which participants interact with
each other and react to external news attempting to gain extra earnings by
beating the markets. In the last decades, econophysics has become to ﬂour-
ish since the pioneering work of Mantegna and Stanley in 1995 [1]. Econo-
physics is an emerging interdisciplinary ﬁeld, where theories, concepts, and

tools borrowed from statistical mechanics, nonlinear sciences, mathematics,
and complexity sciences are applied to understand the self-organized complex
behaviors of ﬁnancial markets [2,3,4]. Econophysicists have discovered or re-
discovered numerous stylized facts of ﬁnancial markets [2,5], such as fat tails
of return distributions [6,1,7,8,9,10,11,12,13], absence of autocorrelations of
returns [2], long memory in volatility [14,15,16], intermittency and multifrac-
tality [7,17,18,19], and leverage eﬀect [20,21], to list a few.

Recently, Lillo and Mantegna have introduced the conception of ensemble vari-
able treating a portfolio of stocks as a whole [22,23,24,25]. They have deﬁned
two quantities, the ensemble return and the variety. The ensemble return µ
is the mean of the returns of the portfolio at time t, which is a measure of
the market direction, while the variety σ is the standard deviation of all the
the returns at time t, which characterizes how diﬀerent the behavior of stocks
is. In the time periods when the markets are very volatile, the ensemble re-
turns have larger ﬂuctuations and the varieties are larger as well. It is very
interesting to note that there are sharp peaks in the variety time series when
the market crashes [24,25], which is reminiscent of the behavior of volatility.
In addition, the daily ensemble return of stocks in the New York Stock Ex-
change is found to be uncorrelated, while the daily variety has long memory
[23]. Despite of such remarkable similarities shared by the ensemble returns
and the returns and by the varieties and the volatilities, there are signiﬁcant
diﬀerence between these “competing” quantities, especially the shapes of the
corresponding distributions.

There are a huge number of studies in the literature showing that emerging
stork markets behave diﬀerently other than the developed markets in many
aspects. In most developed markets, the daily returns have well established
fat tails, while the distributions of daily returns are exponential in several
emerging markets, e.g., in China [26], Brazil [27], and India [28]. It is very
interesting to investigate the statistical properties of the ensemble variables
extracted in emerging stock markets, which is the main motivation of the
current work. We shall focus on the Chinese stock markets in this paper.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, we explain the data set analyzed
and deﬁne explicitly the ensemble return and variety. Section 3 presents analy-
sis on the probability distributions of the daily ensemble returns and varieties.
We discuss in Sec. 4 the temporal correlations of the two quantities, where we
adopt R/S analysis and detrended ﬂuctuation analysis (DFA) to estimate the
Hurst indexes and perform statistical tests using Lo’s modiﬁed R/S statistic.
The last section concludes.

2 China’s stock markets

Before the foundation of People’s Republic of China in 1949, the Shanghai
Stock Exchange was the third largest worldwide, after the New York Stock Ex-
change and the London Stock Exchange and its evolution over the period from
1919 to 1949 had enormous inﬂuence on other world-class ﬁnancial markets
[29]. After 1949, China implemented policies of a socialist planned economy
and the government controlled entirely all investment channels. This proved to
be eﬃcient in the early stage of the economy reconstruction, especially for the
heavy industry. However, planned economic policies have unavoidably led to
ineﬃcient allocation of resources. In 1981, the central government began to is-
sue treasury bonds to raise capital to cover its ﬁnancial deﬁcit, which reopened
the China’s securities markets. After that, local governments and enterprises
were permitted to issue bonds. In 1984, 11 state-owned enterprises became
share-holding corporations and started to provide public oﬀering of stocks.
The establishment of secondary markets for securities occurred in 1986 when
over-the-counter markets were set up to trade corporation bonds and shares.
The ﬁrst market for government-approved securities was founded in Shanghai
on November 26, 1990 and started operating on December 19 of the same
year under the name of the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SHSE). Shortly after,
the Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE) was established on December 1, 1990
and started its operations on July 3, 1991. The historical high happened in
2000 when the total market capitalization reached 4,968 billion yuan (55.5%
of GDP) with 1,535.4 billion yuan of ﬂoat market capitalization (17.2% of
GDP). The size of the Chinese stock market has increased remarkably.

The data set we used in this paper contains daily records of n = 500 stocks
traded in the SHSE and the SZSE in the period from February 1994 to Septem-
ber 2004. The total number of data points exceeds one million. For each stock
price time series, we calculate the daily log-return as follows

where Pi(t) is the close price of stock i on day t. The ensemble return µ(t) is
then deﬁned by

while the variety σ(t) is deﬁned according to

The number of active stocks may vary along time t. When a stock j is not
traded at time t, it is not included in the calculation of µ and σ.

the Chinese stock market as a function of time t from Feb. 1994 to Sep. 2004.
An striking feature is observed in both quantities that the amplitude of the
envelop decreases along time, which indicates that the Chinese stock markets
are becoming less volatile and more eﬃcient.

3 Probability distributions of ensemble variables

The central parts of ensemble returns of NYSE stocks and Nasdaq stocks
are exponentially distributed and the negative part decays slower than the
positive part [23,25], while the tails look like outliers in the sense that those
ensemble returns are extremely large and can not be modeled by the same
exponential distribution as the center part [4]. The Chinese stock markets
have the same behavior qualitatively. Figure 2 shows the empirical probability
density function of µ. We ﬁnd that the main part of the density function has
the following form

skewness being 0.378. It is interesting to note that the Chinese stock markets
have more large ensemble returns than the USA markets, which is consistent
with the fact that the Chinese stock markets are extraordinarily volatile.

4 Long memory in the ensemble variables

4.1 Detrended ﬂuctuation analysis

There are a lot of methods developed to extract temporal correlation in time
series, among which the detrended ﬂuctuation analysis (DFA) is the most
popular method due to its easy implementation and robust estimation even
for short time series [33,34,35]. DFA was invented originally to study the long-
range dependence in coding and noncoding DNA nucleotides sequence [36]
and then applied to various ﬁelds including ﬁnance. In order to investigate
the dependence nature of ensemble variables in China’s stock markets, we
ﬁrst adopt the detrended ﬂuctuation analysis.

The DFA is carried out as follows. Consider a time series x(t), t = 1, 2,
We ﬁrst construct the cumulative sum

· · ·

, N.

u(t) =

x(i),

t = 1, 2,

, N .

· · ·

t

Xi=1

The time interval is then divided into disjoint subintervals of a same length s
and ﬁt u(t) in each subinterval with a polynomial function, which gives us(t),
representing the trend in the subintervals. The detrended ﬂuctuation function
F (s) is then calculated

Varying s, one is able to determine the scaling relation between the detrended
ﬂuctuation function F (s) and time scale s. It is shown that

F 2(s) =

[u(i)

us(i)]2 .

spectrum exponent η by η = 2H

exponent γ by γ = 2

2H.

Figure 5 plots the detrended ﬂuctuation functions F (s) of the ensemble daily
variables µ and σ as a function of time scale s. There are two scaling laws in
the curve for µ, which are separated at the crossover time lag ln s× = 3.6. The
Hurst indices for both scaling ranges are H1 = 0.66
0.02,
respectively. For variety σ, a sound power law scaling relation is observed
with a Hurst index H3 = 0.93
0.01. This strong correlation observed here is
consistent with that in the USA markets, where the autocorrelation exponent
is reported to be γ = 0.230

0.02 and H2 = 0.87

0.006 [23].

4.2 Rescaled range analysis

To further investigate the correlation structure in the ensemble returns and
varieties, we adopt the well-known R/S analysis. R/S analysis was invented
by Hurst [40] and then developed by Mandelbrot and Wallis [41,42], known
also as Hurst analysis or rescaled range analysis.

{

The results of the R/S analysis on the daily ensemble returns and varieties
are presented in Fig. 6. We observe that both variables exhibit two scaling
ranges. For the ensemble returns, the crossover occurs at ln s× = 4.7, which
should be compared with the crossover at ln s× = 3.6 in Fig. 5. The Hurst
0.02
index for small s is H1 = 0.65
in Fig. 5. For larger s, we have H2 = 0.54
0.01, which is much smaller
than H2 = 0.87
0.02 in the detrended ﬂuctuation analysis. This calls for
further investigate of possible long memory in the daily ensemble returns. For
the daily, varieties, the crossover takes place at ln s× = 2.8. The Hurst index
for s 6 s× is H3 = 0.77
0.003,
which is consistent with H3 = 0.93
0.01 in the detrended ﬂuctuation analysis
illustrated in Fig. 5.

4.3 Statistical tests of long memory

The information extracted from the DFA and the R/S analysis performed on
the variety is consistent, where both methods give a large value of Hurst index.
However, the situation is quite diﬀerent when the ensemble is concerned. The
Hurst indexes for large time scale s obtained from the two methods are both
not far away from H = 0.5. Due to the subtlety of the issue of long memory,
we provide further statistical tests for both ensemble variables, adopting Lo’s
modiﬁed R/S statistic [44].

Consider a stationary time series of size n. The modiﬁed R/S statistic is given
by [44]

Qn = Rn/ ˆSn(q) ,
(15)
where Rn is the range of cumulative deviations deﬁned in Eq. (12) and ˆSn(q)

The fractiles can be estimated from Eq. (18): for a bilateral test of 5% signif-

long-term memory, it is proved that Rn trends to the Brownian bridge variable

These properties allow us to distinguish short memory from long memory. The

on the whole time series from 1994/02/14 to 2004/09/15 and its subintervals.
The results for µ are presented in Table 1. For the whole time series, the
hypothesis that there is no long memory can not be rejected. However, the
alternative long memory in several subintervals is signiﬁcant at the α = 5%
level. It is thus possible there exists long memory in µ in the Chinese stock
markets intermittently, which is not unreasonable due to the ineﬃciency of
the emerging markets.

Table 2 presents the tests for the daily varieties σ. The long memory hypoth-
esis is signiﬁcant at the α = 5% level for all values of q in all subintervals
investigated. For the whole time series, the null hypothesis H0 is rejected for
q = 36 and q = 72. For larger values of q, the tests show that there is no
signiﬁcant long memory. Since the deﬁnition of the statistic Vq(n) amounts to
remove “autocorrelation” up to q trading days, the modiﬁed R/S test is biased
to over-reject long memory [45]. Therefore, we argue that the daily varieties
σ are long-term correlated.

5 Conclusion

The ensemble variables µ and σ are important for studying the behavior of
ﬁnancial markets as a whole complex system, instead of individual stocks. In

this paper, we have studied the statistical properties of the daily ensemble re-
turns and daily varieties of 500 stocks traded in the Shanghai Stock Exchanges
and the Shenzhen Stock Exchanges from 1994/02/14 to 2004/09/15.

The daily ensemble returns µ are found to have exponential distributions
followed by power-law tails. The negative ensemble returns decay more slowly
than the positive part. The negative and positive tail exponents are α− =
3.33
0.07. On the other hand, the daily varieties σ
exhibit a log-normal distribution for not large values and a power-law form on
the tail for large values. The tail exponent is estimated to be β = 5.3

0.06 and α+ = 2.86

0.2.

There are numerous controversies on the eﬃciency of the Chinese stock mar-
kets, with slight bias to ineﬃciency [29]. Using detrended ﬂuctuation analy-
sis, R/S analysis and modiﬁed R/S analysis, we have shown that the daily
ensemble returns have long-term memory in several time periods, which is
nevertheless insigniﬁcant in the whole time series. Speciﬁcally, the long mem-
ory disappears only in the time period from 1999/05/19 to 2002/01/14. This
indicates that the Chinese stock markets do not follow random walks in most
time periods. The long-term memory in the daily varieties is quite strong with
a large hurst index H = 0.91

0.93.

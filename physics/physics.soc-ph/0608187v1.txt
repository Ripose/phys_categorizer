High Impact but Less Popular

By using the SLAC-SPIRES database it is shown that, in spite of obtaining a high

impact, Nature and Science are still less popular in the particle physics community.

Abstract

In 2004 the Institute for Science Information (ISI) released a list of “ten hottest jour-
nals” in physics [1]. Those journals were ranked according to the number of averaged
citations per paper they have obtained from 1992 until 2002. For the sake of the present
discussion, we only display ﬁve of them in Table 1, from which it is obvious that Science
and Nature are crowned as the two top journals having the highest citation numbers per
paper and, consequently, the highest impact factors (IF). In fact, the number of cita-
tions per paper obtained by Science in this period is almost seven times higher than that
obtained by Physical Review D, one of the longstanding respected journals in particle
physics.

IF has become a source of controversial debates lately. Controversial because the IF
deﬁnition, namely the number of citations obtained in a speciﬁc year by papers published
in a journal in the previous two years divided by the number of these papers, is found
to have some ﬂaws [2]. However, this factor would have never been seriously considered
except until some people started to use it to control scientiﬁc enterprises, such as assessing
the quality of individual papers, scrutinizing an applicant’s track-record when considering
research funds or academic promotions, and evaluating the performance of a research
institute or a department.

As a natural consequence, some researchers feel the pressure to publish their papers in
a journal with a high IF. Indeed, there has been a report that publishing papers in journals
with IF above 5 is a prescription to get a tenure in certain universities in the US, whereas
to get a PhD at some universities in China a graduate student must publish at least two
papers in the journals with an IF of 4 or more [3]. Furthermore, some scientists believe

that publishing a paper in a high IF journal will guarantee a high number of citation (the
so-called “free ride hypothesis”).

In view of this, it is very important to raise such a question: does IF (or averaged cita-
tions) really mean everything about the journal or paper quality? To answer this question
let us look back to Table 1. Comparing the two top journals (Science and Nature) with
the rest three, which are considered as the habitat of the particle physics community,
reveals the fact that both Science and Nature suﬀer from the problem of low productivity.
Presumably, this is originated from the very strict editorial and refereeing processes they
have used. Such mechanism might raise some complains from prominent scientists who
sometimes have speculative papers. It is widely known that in many branches of science
most important ﬁndings, which eventually led to Nobel prizes, came from a revolutionized
idea which did not follow the mainstream. Such an idea would be most likely rejected
by the current system of refereeing process, unless the editors and referees slightly re-
laxed their criteria. Take for example the history of quantum mechanics or the ﬁnding of
anomalous magnetic moment by Otto Stern [4]. Nevertheless, in spite of the fact that the
low productivity has a negative impact on the popularity of the journal, the IF deﬁnition
(namely the averaged citations) clearly penalizes high productivity. This was pointed out
by Jorge E. Hirsch and also became one of the reasons why he proposed the “h-index” as
an alternative measure of the scientiﬁc output of a researcher [5].

To be more quantitative let us consider the particle physics papers with more than
1000 citations (from now on will be labeled by 1000+) detected by SLAC-SPIRES [6], a
database consisting of more than 500.000 nuclear and particle physics papers published
between 1950 and 2005. Although the database only includes Nobel papers in that period,
a 1000+ paper obviously reﬂects a revolutionized idea or contains spectacular experimental
data. The corresponding journals which published those papers are shown in Table 2. It
is quite surprising that none of the 1000+ papers was published in Nature and Science.
Only if we go down to 500+ papers we ﬁnd that 3 papers were published in Nature and
2 papers were published in Science. This becomes an obvious indication that the number
of citations per paper which determines the number of IF is not directly correlated to
the importance of journals, in the sense of journals that publish important papers. To
visualize this fact we plot the number of 1000+ and 500+ papers as a function of diﬀerent
journals in Fig. 1, where as a comparison we also show the 2003 IF of the corresponding
journals.1 From this ﬁgure we can directly conclude that there is no obvious correlation
between high IF and high number of citations.

To further investigate why both Nature and Science obtained the highest averaged
citations, in Fig. 2 we plot the number of 1000+, 500+, 100+, and 50+ papers published
in all ﬁve journals listed in Table 1. We again ﬁnd a similar pattern, namely very small
fractions of those highly cited papers were published in Nature and Science. This clearly
shows that, on average, all papers published in both journals (note that they publish all
physics subjects) have citations between 50 and 100, thus yielding an averaged citation
around 70.

As discussed above a very strict editorial process will most likely ﬁlter out very im-
portant publications. Besides that, we will not exclude the contribution from the intrinsic
problem of a general-reader journal. It is widely known that most important ﬁndings usu-
1The choice of the 2003 IF is trivial. However, since the IF does not dramatically ﬂuctuate from year
to year, for the purpose of the current discussion this is considered to be suﬃcient. Review journals (such
as Review of Modern Physics) tend to have a high IF.

ally require a very detailed technical explanation and, as a consequence, the corresponding
reports will certainly not suitable for publication in Nature2 or Science. Another obvious
example is shown by Table 2. Although highly respected as a top American Physical Soci-
ety journal, Physical Review Letters occupies the third rank after Physical Review D and
Nuclear Physics B.

To conclude, the above discussion corroborates the ﬁnding of Per O. Seglen that the
“free ride hypothesis” is really a myth [7]. By observing two groups of scientiﬁc authors
who published their papers in two diﬀerent journals with signiﬁcantly diﬀerent IF, he
arrived at a conclusion that article citation rates determine the journal IF, but not vice
versa.

Summary. The common assumption of universal behavior in stock market data can
sometimes lead to false conclusions. In statistical physics, the Hurst exponents char-
acterizing long-range correlations are often closely related to universal exponents.
We show, that in the case of time series of the traded value, these Hurst exponents
increase logarithmically with company size, and thus are non-universal. Moreover,
the average transaction size shows scaling with the mean transaction frequency for
large enough companies. We present a phenomenological scaling framework that
properly accounts for such dependencies.

Key words: econophysics; stock market; ﬂuctuation phenomena

1 Introduction

The last decades have seen a lot of contribution by physicists to various other
subjects. The applied methods are often rooted in modern statistical physics,
and in particular scaling and universality. Examples range from biology [1] to
ﬁnance [2–5]. Successes achieved in the latter area have lead to the formation
of a whole new ﬁeld, commonly called econophysics. But despite the large
number of studies and the undeniable progress that has been made, one worry
still remains: There is very little theoretical ground to assume that physical
concepts are actually appropriate to describe, e.g., stock market ﬂuctuations
[6]. Critically speaking, it is equally justiﬁed to consider the often used power
laws as only a way to ﬁt data. Instead of universality, what one actually
observes in econophysics, can also be seen as just a robustness of qualitative
features, which is a much weaker property.

In this paper we revisit a previously introduced framework for ﬁnancial
ﬂuctuations [7], that can be used to explicitly show the absence of universal
behavior in trading activity. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 in-
troduces notations and the dataset that will be used. Section 3 shows, that

2

many key features of the traded value of stocks depend on the size of the
company whose stock is considered. We ﬁnd that as we go to larger and larger
companies:

(i) the average transaction size increases,
(ii) the Hurst exponent of traded value/min grows as the logarithm of the

mean of the same quantity,

(iii) ﬂuctuations of the trading activity grow as a non-trivial, time scale de-

pendent power of mean traded value.

Section 4 integrates these ﬁndings into a consistent, common scaling frame-
work, and points out the connection between the three observations.

2 Notations and data

First, let us introduce a few notations that will be used throughout the paper.
For a time window size ∆t, one can write the total traded value of stock i
during the interval [t, t + ∆t] as

f ∆t
i

(t) =

Vi(n),

Xn,ti(n)∈[t,t+∆t]

where ti(n) is the time of the n-th transaction of stock i. The number of
elements in the sums, i.e., the number of trades in the time window, we will
denote as N∆t(t). The so called tick-by-tick data are denoted by Vi(n), which
is the value exchanged in trade n. This is the product of the transaction price
pi(n) and the traded volume ˜Vi(n):

Vi(n) = pi(n) ˜Vi(n).

Note that the use of V instead of ˜V automatically eliminates any anomalies
caused by stock splits or dividends.

The data we analyze is from a TAQ database [8], containing all transactions
of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) for the years 1993 − 2003. The
samples were always restricted to those stocks that were traded every month
during the period of that speciﬁc calculation. We detrended the data by the
well-known U -shaped daily pattern of traded volumes, similarly to Ref. [9].

Finally, h·i always denotes time average, and log(·) means 10-base loga-

rithm throughout the paper.

3 Size dependent properties of trading activity

In the econophysics literature, it is common practice to assume a form of
universal behavior in stock market dynamics. The trading of diﬀerent stocks,

on diﬀerent markets and for various time periods is assumed to follow the
same laws, and this is – at least qualitatively – indeed found in the case of
many stylized facts [4, 5]. However, recent studies [7, 10] have pointed out,
that this is not completely general. In this section, we present two properties
of trading, that appear robust between markets and time periods, and which
are related to a distinct company size dependence.

Company size is usually measured by the capitalization, but trading fre-
quency hN∆ti (measured in trades/min), or the average traded value hf∆ti
(measured in USD/min) are also adequate measures of the importance of a
company: Very small companies are traded infrequently, while large ones very
often, and, naturally, traded value has a corresponding behavior. In fact, one
ﬁnds, that hN∆ti and hf∆ti are non-trivial, monotonic functions of capitaliza-
tion [10, 11].

3.1 Dependence of the average trade size on trading frequency

Let us ﬁrst construct a very simple measurement: calculate the average number
of trades per minute (hNii) and the mean value exchanged per trade (hVii).
One can plot these two quantities versus each other for all stocks (see Fig.
1), to ﬁnd a remarkably robust behavior. For all the periods 1994 − 1995,
1998 − 1999, and 2000, the data lack a clear tendency where trading frequency
is low (hNii < 10−2 trades/min). Then, as we go to more frequently traded
companies, an approximate power law emerges:

hVii ∝ hNiiβ .

(3)

The measured exponents are around β ≈ 0.5, systematically greater than the
value β ≈ 0.2 found for NASDAQ (see also Refs. [7, 10]), and smaller than
β ≈ 1 for London’s FTSE-100 [11].

In some sense trades appear to ”stick together”: Once a stock is traded
more and more intensively, traders seem to prefer to increase their size as the
frequency cannot be increased beyond limits.

3.2 Size-dependent correlations

The correlation properties of stock market time series have been studied ex-
tensively [4, 5, 12, 13]. However, with very few exceptions [14], such studies
were limited to the stocks of large companies. Those, in general, were found
to display universal patterns of behavior.

In this section we focus on the correlations of the traded value f . Recently
it was pointed out by two independent studies [10, 15] that both this f and
trading volumes have ﬁnite variance, in contrast to early ﬁndings [12]. Thus,
it is meaningful to deﬁne a Hurst exponent H(i) [16, 17] for f as

σ(i, ∆t) =

Fig. 1. The dependence of the mean value per trade hVii on the average number of
trades/min hNii. Calculations were done for the periods 1994−1995 ((cid:3)), 1998−1999
(O), and for the year 2000 (▽, see Ref. [10]). For the smallest stocks the data lack
a clear tendency. However, larger stocks show scaling between the two quantities,
according to (3). The slopes are around β = 0.55 ± 0.05, regardless of time period.
Note: Groups of stocks were binned, and log hVii was averaged for better visibility.

The signal is correlated for H > 0.5, and uncorrelated for H = 0.5. Signiﬁcant
anticorrelated behavior (H < 0.5) does not usually occur in this context.

One ﬁnds, that the Hurst exponent does not exist in a strict sense: all
stocks show a crossover [10] between two types of behavior around the time
scale of 1 day. This threshold depends on the market and the time period
under study, but keeping those constant, it does not depend on the actual
stock in any systematic way.

We did the calculations for two time periods, 1994 − 1995 and 1998 − 1999.
Under a certain size of time windows, which is ∆t < 20 min for 1994−1995 and
∆t < 6 min for 1998 − 1999, the trading activity is uncorrelated for all stocks.
However, when one chooses ∆t > 300 min, the picture changes completely.
There, small hf i stocks again display only very weak correlations, but larger
ones up to H ≈ 0.9. Moreover, there is a clear logarithmic trend in the data:

H(i) = H ∗ + γt log hfii ,

(5)

with γt(∆t > 300 min) = 0.05 ± 0.01 for 1994 − 1995 and γt(∆t > 300
min) = 0.07 ± 0.01 for 1998 − 1999. As a reference, we also checked that
Hshuﬀ (i) = 0.5 for the shuﬄed time series. All results are shown in Fig. 2.

The most interesting point is that the crossover is not from uncorrelated
to correlated, but from homogeneous to inhomogeneous behavior. For short
times, all stocks show H(i) ≈ H1, i.e., γt = 0. For long times, H(i) changes

Fig. 2. Value of the Hurst exponents H(i) for the time periods 1994−1995 (left) and
2000 − 2002 (right). For short time windows (O, ∆t < 20 min for 1994 − 1995, and
∆t < 6 min for 1998 − 1999), all signals are nearly uncorrelated, H(i) ≈ 0.51 − 0.52.
The ﬁtted slope is γt = 0.00 ± 0.01. For larger time windows ((cid:4). ∆t > 300 min), the
strength of correlations depends logarithmically on the mean trading activity of the
stock, γt = 0.05 ± 0.01 for 1994 − 1995, and γt = 0.05 ± 0.01 for 1998 − 1999. Shuﬄed
data (▽) display no correlations, thus Hshuﬀ (i) = 0.5, which also implies γt = 0.

with hfii and γt > 0. This can also be understood as a dependence on company
size, as hf i is roughly proportional to capitalization [10].

3.3 Fluctuation scaling

The technique of ﬂuctuation scaling is very similar to the above, and it was
recently applied to stock market data (see, e.g., Refs. [7, 9]). It is based on
a phenomenological scaling law that connects the standard deviation σi and
the average hfii of the trading activity for all stocks:

σ(i, ∆t) ∝ hfiiα(∆t) ,

(6)

where the scaling variable is hfii (or i), and ∆t is kept constant. That is, the
standard deviation of a quantity scales with the mean of the same quantity.

sizes from bottom to top: ∆t = 10 sec, 0.5 day, 2 weeks. The slopes are α(∆t) =
0.75, 0.78, 0.88, respectively. Points were shifted vertically for better visibility.

σ(i, ∆t) is the same as used in the deﬁnition of the Hurst exponent (4), where
i was constant and ∆t was varied.

The presence of scaling (6) is not at all a trivial fact. Nevertheless, one
ﬁnds that it holds quite generally, for any ∆t. Here, we conﬁrm this for the
periods 1994 − 1995 and 1998 − 1999, examples of scaling plots are shown in
Fig. 3.

A systematic investigation ﬁnds, that α strongly depends on the ∆t size
of the time windows. Fig. 4 shows, that when ∆t is at most a few minutes,
α(∆t) is constant, the values are 0.74 and 0.70 for 1994−1995 and 1998−1999,
respectively. Then, after an intermediate regime, for window sizes ∆t > 300
min, there is a logarithmic trend:

α(∆t) = α∗ + γf log ∆t,

(7)

with slopes γf = 0.05 ± 0.01 for 1994 − 1995, and γf = 0.07 ± 0.01 for
1998 − 1999.

4 Scaling theory

The stock market is only one of many examples for ﬂuctuation scaling, which
is in fact a very general and robust phenomenon, that was observed in many
complex systems, ranging from highway traﬃc to ﬂuctations in the visitations
of web pages [9, 18, 19]. Here, the elements of the system are the web pages
or highways, and fi(t) is not trading activity, but still some a form ”activity”
(number of visitation to the page, volume of car traﬃc through the road).

A previous study [18] found, that in temporally uncorrelated systems, two
universality classes exist. Under strong external driving, all systems show α =

Fig. 4. The dependence of the scaling exponent α on the window size ∆t. The darker
shaded intervals have well-deﬁned Hurst exponents and values of γt, the crossover
is indicated with a lighter background. 1994 − 1995 (left): without shuﬄing ((cid:4)) the
slopes of the linear regimes are γf (∆t < 20 min) = 0.00 ± 0.01 and γf (∆t > 300
min) = 0.05±0.01. For shuﬄed data (O) the exponent is independent of window size,
α(∆t) = 0.74±0.02. 1998−1999 (right): without shuﬄing ((cid:4)) the slopes of the linear
regimes are γf (∆t < 6 min) = 0.00 ± 0.01 and γf (∆t > 300 min) = 0.07 ± 0.01. For
shuﬄed data (O) the exponent is independent of window size, α(∆t) = 0.70 ± 0.02.

1. Systems with a robust internal dynamics, consisting of i.i.d. events, display
α = 1/2.

When the size of the events is not identically distributed throughout the
system, that can lead to the breaking of universality, and intermediate values
of α. This is what happens in the case of stock markets. When ∆t is small
(seconds to a few minutes), the transactions can be assumed to arrive inde-
pendently, but their size is inhomogeneous, as pointed out in Sec. 3.1. In the
complete absence of correlations, there would a clear relationship between the
exponents α and β [19]:

α =

1 +

2 (cid:18)

β
β + 1 (cid:19)

.

(8)

Substituting β = 0.55 yields α(∆t → 0) = 0.68 ± 0.01, which agrees within
the error bars with the result for 1998 − 1999, but it is somewhat smaller
than the actual value for 1994 − 1995. Also note that β only exists for large
enough stocks, whereas α and ﬂuctuation scaling applies to all stocks. We
believe, that the discrepancies are due to the fact, that the picture presented
in Ref. [19] is an overly simpliﬁed model for the stock market. Nevertheless,
it is remarkable, that the breaking of universality and the rough value of the
exponent is predicted properly.

Zolt´an Eisler and J´anos Kert´esz

Let us now turn to the ∆t dependence of α. First of all, let us notice, that
for both periods, there is a change from a constant value to a logarithmic in-
crease, and this is at exactly the same ∆t’s, where Sec. 3.2 found the crossovers
from homogeneous to inhomogeneous correlations. In fact, the correspondence
between the two observations is not incidental. Both the Hurst exponents H(i)
and α(∆t) describe the behavior of the same standard deviation σ(i, ∆t):

σ(i, ∆t) =

(cid:10)

E

(cid:11)(cid:1)

∝ ∆tH(i),

and

σ(i, ∆t) ∝ hfiiα(∆t) .

A simple calculation [7] can show that the only possible way for these two
scaling laws to coexist, is when

α(∆t) = α∗ + γ log ∆t
H(i) = H ∗ + γ log hfii ,

(9)

(10)

where a key point is that the two slopes γ are the same. In short, for the two
previously introduced constants γt = γf = γ.

Again, this is in harmony with the actual observations. Due to the previ-
ously mentioned crossover in correlations, one has to distinguish three regimes
in ∆t.

1. For small ∆t, all stocks display the same, nearly uncorrelated trading
behavior, i.e., γ = 0. Accordingly, α(∆t) is constant, regardless of window
size.

2. For an intermediate range of ∆t’s, we are in the crossover regime. H does
not exist for any stock. α still does exist, but – as expected – its time
window dependence does not follow a logarithmic trend.

3. For large ∆t, the Hurst exponent increases logarithmically with the mean
traded value hf i, and so does α with ∆t. The slopes agree very well (γt =
γf ) for both time periods.

As noted before, the equality γt = γf can be calculated fairly easily, but
one can look at this result in a diﬀerent way. Both ﬂuctuation scaling and
the Hurst exponent (or equivalently, power law autocorrelations) are present
in a very wide range of complex systems. But we have just seen that this is
only possible in two of ways: the correlations must either be homogeneous
throughout the system (H(i) = H, γ = 0), or they must have a logarithmic
dependence on mean activity. Consequently, when one for example looks at
the results of Sec. 3.2, they are not surprising at all. The coexistence of our
two scaling laws is so restrictive, that if the strength of correlations depends
on company size, and thus on hf i, the realized logarithmic dependence is the
only possible scenario.

5 Conclusions

In the above, we presented some recent ﬁndings concerning the ﬂuctuations of
stock market trading activity. As the central point of the paper, we discussed
the application of ﬂuctuation scaling. We gave evidence, that the logarithmic
increase of the Hurst exponent of traded value with the mean traded value
comes as a very natural consequence of ﬂuctuation scaling. The behavior of
the companies depends on a continuous parameter: the average traded value,
or equivalently, company size.

This is a clear sign of non-universality, and thus contrary to a naive expec-
tation from statistical physics. For example, in the case of surface growth [16],
the Hurst exponent of surface height ﬂuctuations is universal to a certain type
of growth dynamics. In contrast, on the market the ”dynamics” (i.e., trading
rules) are the same for all stocks, but the resulting exponents still vary. While
we believe that it is possible, that at least some properties of trading are
universal, but we wish to point out that not all of them are.

Our results imply that one must take great care when applying concepts
like scaling and universality to ﬁnancial markets. The present theoretical mod-
els of trading should be extended to account for the capitalization dependence
of the characteristic quantities, which is a great challenge for future research.

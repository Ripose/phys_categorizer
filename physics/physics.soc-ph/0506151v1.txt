Phase coexistence in a forecasting game

Philippe Curty and Matteo Marsili
The Abdus Salam International Center of Theoretical Physics, Trieste, Italy
(Dated: September 25, 2013)

Individual choices are either based on personal experience or on information provided by peers.
The latter case, causes individuals to conform to the majority in their neighborhood. Such herding
behavior may be very eﬃcient in aggregating disperse private information, thereby revealing the
optimal choice. However if the majority relies on herding, this mechanism may dramatically fail to
aggregate correctly the information, causing the majority adopting the wrong choice. We address
these issues in a simple model of interacting agents who aim at giving a correct forecast of a public
variable, either seeking private information or resorting to herding. As the fraction of herders
increases, the model features a phase transition beyond which a state where most agents make the
correct forecast coexists with one where most of them are wrong. Simple strategic considerations
suggest that indeed such a system of agents self-organizes deep in the coexistence region. There,
agents tend to agree much more among themselves than with what they aim at forecasting, as found
in recent empirical studies.

Information aﬀects

in many subtle ways

socio-
economic behavior, giving rise to non-trivial collective
phenomena. For example, a key function of markets
is that of aggregating the information scattered among
traders into prices. However, if traders rely on the in-
formation conveyed by prices, this same mechanism may
lead to self-sustaining speculative bubbles. Likewise, we
deduce the worth of a restaurant or the importance of
a research subject from its crowdedness or popularity.
However, popularity can consecrate even totally random
choices [1].

Collective herding phenomena in general pose quite
interesting problems in statistical physics. To name a
few examples, anomalous ﬂuctuations in ﬁnancial mar-
kets and opinion dynamics have been related to perco-
lation theory based models of herding [2, 3, 4, 5] and
social changes have been shown to follow patterns which
are well explained by the theory of random ﬁeld Ising
models [6]. It is natural to expect herding behavior in
cases when it is convenient for the individuals to follow
the herd. For example, when the majority is buying in
the stock market, prices goes up, hence buying becomes
the right thing to do (at least in the short run).
If a
fax machine) is widely adopted, it be-
technology (e.g.
comes more convenient to adopt it. Herding takes place
even in cases where agents’ behavior does not inﬂuence
the outcome, if agents try to infer information about the
[1] dis-
optimal choice from the actions of others. Ref.
cussed how these considerations are important for issues
ranging from the prevalence of crime, marketing, fads
and fashions to the onset of protests such as that lead-
ing to the collapse of the East German regime. Ref. [7]
remarks that herding might explain why ﬁnancial fore-
casters tend to make very similar predictions – whose
diversity is much smaller than the prediction’s error.

From the theoretical side, the onset of herding and
the resulting failure of information aggregation has been
shown to occur in models of information cascades [1].
The prototype example is that of a set of agents who
have to chose one of two restaurants on the basis of some

private noisy information. If each of them chooses simul-
taneously according to his/her private signal, the major-
ity will chose the best restaurant. However if agents take
choices one after the other and each can observe what
others have chosen before, the result changes dramati-
cally. From a certain point onward, the behavior of the
majority provides more information than that of private
signal, hence it is optimal for agents to follow the major-
ity, disregarding their private signal. As a result, choices
disclose no further information and there is a sizeable
probability that all enter the worse restaurant.

In this letter, we show that information herding can
bring to non trivial collective phenomena even when
agents observe a ﬁnite number of peers and act in no par-
ticular order. In particular, a population of selﬁsh agents
fails to correctly aggregate information because herding
brings the system into a coexistence region, where the
vast majority of agents “agrees” on the same forecast,
not necessarily the right one. A statistical mechanics ap-
proach gives a detailed account of the results in terms of
a zero temperature Ising model with asymmetric inter-
action. These insights extend to the case where agents
have to forecast a variable in a continuous interval. Again
we ﬁnd a spinodal point beyond which forecasts tend to
cluster, as observed in Ref. [7].

transitions across qu in the early stages of the dynamics
for small N . It is easy to show that, for η

which shows that there is a window of size 1/√N close to
η = 1 where p− is sizeable. As a consequence, the fall of
q in this region gets steeper and steeper as N increases.
This consideration is important is we analyze the be-
havior of selﬁsh agents following game theory [8]. We
assume for simplicity that agents aim at reaching a cor-
rect forecast, i.e. that their payoﬀ is the probability that
fi = E. As long as
> p agents will ﬁnd it more
convenient to switch from the I to H strategy. Hence,
the fraction η of herders increases when
> p. The
contrary is true when
< p and hence we expect that
the population will self-organize to a state η∗, such that
no agent has incentive to change strategy, i.e. where
= p. Such a state is called a Nash equilibrium [8].

h
Its standard interpretation as the equilibrium of forward
looking rational agents, who correctly anticipate the be-
havior of others, given the rules of the game, and respond
optimally, requires agents to solve a rather complex sta-
tistical mechanical problem. We will however show below
that adaptive agents with limited rationality can “learn”
to converge to such a Nash equilibrium.

Such a spectacular event is similar to the outcome of

Does this scenario changes when we introduce het-
erogeneity in agents’ characteristics? Let us ﬁrst con-
sider the case where agent i, when using strategy H,
can observe Ki peers. Na¨ively one would expect that
agents with larger Ki receive more precise information
and hence should prefer the H strategy. However, be-
cause at the Nash equilibrium almost every agent is mak-
ing the same prediction, either right or wrong, a larger
“window” Ki does not help. The case where agents have

in the coexistence region, where Eqs. (3,4) have three

Eqs. (5,6) as a function of η and p, and then using Eq.
(8) to compute η and p self-consistently. The results are

When β is large, there is small heterogeneity and we are
back to the case pi = p: Almost all agents follow the

The analytical results were tested against numerical
simulations of adaptive agents who repeatedly play the
game and learn, in the course of time, about their op-
timal choice.
In order to do this, agents compute the
cumulative payoﬀ for both strategies and adopt the strat-
egy with the largest score [9]. As expected, we ﬁnd that
in each run there is a value q such that all agents with
pi > q play the I strategy whereas those with pi < q
herd. Again some deviations occur for small N but the
agreement improves as N increases. This shows that the
type of equilibria we discuss are “learnable” by a pop-
ulation of not extremely sophisticated agents. It is well
known that the type of reinforcement learning dynam-
ics discussed above has close analogies with evolutionary
dynamics [10]. Hence the above scenario, might as well
describe social norms which are the result of evolutionary
processes.

The insights of the discrete model hold also when agents
have to forecast a continuous variable E. In order to show
this, we adopt an asymmetric version of the continuous
opinion model of Ref. [4], where a population of N agents

empirical herding coeﬃcient, is a measure of herding as
explained in Ref. [7]. Fig. 3 shows the results of numeri-
cal simulations of the model as a function of the fraction
η of herders, for a typical choice of the parameters. As
in the discrete model, we ﬁnd that for small values of

seeking agents (p) and it increases because herding agents
aggregate the information of other agents who are also
herding. Upon increasing η further, q reaches a maxi-
mum and then it decreases as the information entering
in the system diminishes. In this region, we ﬁnd coex-
istence of a state where the vast majority of agents are
right with a state where almost all of them are wrong.
The Nash equilibrium, where both strategy are equally

comparable to those found in Ref. [7] on a survey of earn-

other ﬁve to ten times more than with the actual result,
was claimed to be related to herding eﬀects in Ref. [7], a
conclusion fully supported by our results. Furthermore,
as in the discrete model, the Nash equilibrium moves to-
wards η = 1 as N increases, thus making herd behavior
more pronounced.

In conclusion, we introduced a simple model captur-
ing the tension between private information seeking and
exploiting information gathered by others (herding) in a
population. When few agents herd, information aggrega-
tion is very eﬃcient. This makes herding the choice taken
by nearly the whole population, thus setting the system
deep in a “coexistence” region where the population as a
whole adopts either the right or the wrong forecast. This
scenario is rather robust and applies both to a discrete
and a continuum model and it compares well with empir-
ical ﬁndings [7]. The model and the statistical mechanics
analysis can serve as a basis to address a wide range of
related issues.

Abstract

Analyzing football score data with statistical techniques, we investigate how the not purely

random, but highly co-operative nature of the game is reﬂected in averaged properties such as the

probability distributions of scored goals for the home and away teams. As it turns out, especially the

tails of the distributions are not well described by the Poissonian or binomial model resulting from

the assumption of uncorrelated random events. Instead, a good eﬀective description of the data is

provided by less basic distributions such as the negative binomial one or the probability densities of

extreme value statistics. To understand this behavior from a microscopical point of view, however,

no waiting time problem or extremal process need be invoked. Instead, modifying the Bernoulli

random process underlying the Poissonian model to include a simple component of self-aﬃrmation

seems to describe the data surprisingly well and allows to understand the observed deviation from

Gaussian statistics. The phenomenological distributions used before can be understood as special

cases within this framework. We analyzed historical football score data from many leagues in

Europe as well as from international tournaments, including data from all past tournaments of

the “FIFA World Cup” series, and found the proposed models to be applicable rather universally.

In particular, here we analyse the results of the German women’s premier football league and

consider the two separate German men’s premier leagues in the East and West during the cold

war times and the uniﬁed league after 1990 to see how scoring in football and the component of

self-aﬃrmation depend on cultural and political circumstances.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Football is perhaps the most popular sports in Europe, attracting millions of spectators

and involving thousands of players each year. As a traditional socio-cultural institution of

signiﬁcant economical importance, football has also been the subject of numerous scientiﬁc

eﬀorts, for instance geared towards the improvement of game tactics, the understanding

of the social eﬀects of the fan scene etc. Much less eﬀort has been devoted, it seems, to

the understanding of football (and other ball sports) from the perspective of the stochastic

behavior of co-operative “agents” (i.e., players) in abstract models. This problem as well as

many other topics relating to the statistical properties of socially interacting systems have

recently been identiﬁed as ﬁelds where the model-based point-of-view and methodological

machinery of statistical mechanics might add a new perspective to the much more detailed

investigations of more speciﬁc disciplines [1].

Score distributions of football and other ball games have been occasionally considered by

mathematical statisticians for more than ﬁfty years [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. Initially, the limited

available data were found to be reasonably modeled by the Poissonian distribution resulting

from the simplest assumption of a completely random process with a ﬁxed (but possibly

team dependent) scoring probability [2]. In the following, it was empirically found that a

better ﬁt could be produced with a negative binomial distribution originally introduced as

an ad hoc measure of generalizing the parameter range for ﬁtting certain biological data

[9]. The negative binomial form occurs naturally for a mixture of Poissonian processes

with a certain distribution of (independent) success probabilities [3]. Furthermore, recently

it was found [8] that score distributions of some football leagues are better described by

the generalized distributions of extreme value statistics [10], while others rather follow the

negative binomial distribution. This yielded a rather inhomogeneous picture and, more

generally, for a system of highly co-operative entities it might be presumed that models

without correlations cannot be an adequate description. What is more, all these proposals

remained in the realm of observation, since the considered statistical models where selected

by best ﬁt, without oﬀering any microscopical justiﬁcation for the choice.

The distribution of extremes, i.e., the probability density function of (kth) maximal or

minimal values of independent realizations of a random variable, is described by only a few

universality classes, depending on the asymptotic behavior of the original distribution [10].

2

Apart from the direct importance of the problem of extremes in actuarial mathematics and

engineering, generalized extreme value (GEV) distributions have been found to occur in such

diverse systems as the statistical mechanics of regular and disordered systems [11, 12, 13, 14,

15, 16], turbulence [17] or earth quake data [18]. However, in most cases global properties

were considered instead of explicit extremes, and the occurrence of GEV distributions led to

speculations about hidden extremal processes in these systems, which could not be identiﬁed

in most cases, though. It was only realized recently that GEV distributions can also arise

naturally as the statistics of sums of correlated random variables [19, 20, 21], which could

explain their ubiquity in physical systems.

For the problem of scoring in football, correlations naturally occur through processes

of (positive and negative) feedback of scoring on both teams, and we shall see how the

introduction of simple rules for the adaptation of the success probabilities in a modiﬁed

Bernoulli process upon scoring a goal leads to systematic deviations from Gaussian statistics.

We ﬁnd simple models with a single parameter of self-aﬃrmation to best describe the

available data, including cases with relatively poor ﬁts of the negative binomial distribution.

The latter is shown to result from one of these models in a particular limit, explaining the

relatively good ﬁts observed before. For the models under consideration, exact recurrence

relations and precise closed-form approximations of the probability density functions can

be derived. Although the limiting distributions of the considered models in general do not

follow the statistics of extremes, it is demonstrated how alternative models leading to GEV

distributions could be constructed. The best ﬁts are found for models where each extra goal

encourages a team even more than the previous one: a true sign of football fever .

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II discusses the probability distri-

butions used by us and previous authors to ﬁt football score data and their relations to the

microscopic models introduced here. The results of ﬁts of the considered models and distri-

butions to the data are summarized and discussed in Sec. III with emphasis on a comparison

of the goal distributions in the divided Germany of the cold war times and of the German

women’s and men’s premier leagues, and an analysis of the results of the “FIFA World Cup”

series. Finally, Sec. IV contains our conclusions, and some of the statistical technicalities of

the considered modiﬁed binomial models are summarized in App. A.

II. PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS AND MICROSCOPIC MODELS

The most obvious and readily available global property characterizing a football match is

certainly given by the overall score of the game. Hence, to investigate the balance of chance

and skill in football [3], here we consider the distributions of goals scored by the home and

away teams in football league or cup matches. To the simplest possible approximation, both

teams have independent and constant probabilities of scoring during each appropriate time

interval of the match, thus degrading football to a pure game of chance. Since the scoring

probabilities will be small, the resulting probabilities of ﬁnal scores will follow a Poissonian

distribution,

P h

λh(nh) =

exp(−λh), P a

λa(na) =

exp(−λa),

(2.1)

nh

λh
nh!

na

λa
na!

where nh and na are the ﬁnal scores of the home and away teams, respectively, and the

parameters λh and λa are related to the average number of goals scored by a team, λ = hni.

As an additional check of the ﬁt to the data, one might then also consider the probability

densities of the sum σ = nh + na and diﬀerence δ = nh − na of goals scored,

P Σ

λh,λa(σ) =

λh(n)P a
P h

λa(σ − n) =

where Iδ is the modiﬁed Bessel function (see [22], p. 374). Note that P Σ

λh,λa(σ) is itself a

Poissonian distribution with parameter λ = λh + λa.

Clearly, the assumption of constant and independent scoring probabilities for the teams

is not appropriate for real-world football matches. Since we are interested in averages over

the matches during one or several seasons of a football league or cup, one might expect

a distribution of scoring probabilities λ depending on the diﬀerent skills of the teams, the

lineup for the match, tactics, weather conditions etc., leading to the notion of a compound

Poisson distribution. It can be easily shown [23, 24] that for the special case of the scoring

probabilities λ following a gamma distribution,

0,

f (λ) = 

λr−1e−aλ,

(2.3)

the resulting compound Poisson distribution has the form of a negative binomial distribution

(NBD),

Pr,p(n) =

dλ Pλ(n)f (λ) =

(2.4)

Γ(r + n)
n! Γ(r)

where p = 1/(1 + a). The negative binomial form has been found to describe football score

data rather well [4, 8]. The underlying assumption of the scoring probabilities following

a gamma distribution seems to be rather ad hoc, however, and ﬁtting diﬀerent seasons of

our data with the Poissonian model (2.1), the resulting distribution of the parameters λ

does not resemble the gamma form (2.3). Analogous to Eq. (2.2), for the negative binomial

distribution (2.4) one can evaluate the probabilities for the sum σ and diﬀerence δ of goals

scored by the home and away teams,

P Σ
ph,rh,pa,ra(σ) = (1 − ph)rh(1 − pa)rapa

ph,rh,pa,ra(δ) = (1 − ph)rh(1 − pa)raph

δ Γ(rh + δ)
δ! Γ(rh) 2F1 (rh + δ, ra; 1 + δ; phpa) ,

(cid:18)

,

(2.5)

where 2F1 is the hypergeometric function (see [22], p. 555). Restricting ph = pa, the distri-

bution of the total score simpliﬁes to P Σ

p,r,q,s(σ) = Pp,r+s(σ), i.e., one ﬁnds a composition law

similar to the case of the Poissonian distribution.

To do justice to the fact that playing football is diﬀerent from playing dice, one has to take

into account that goals are not simply independent events but, instead, scoring certainly has

a profound feedback on the motivation and possibility of subsequent scoring of both teams

(via direct motivation/demotivation of the players, but also, e.g., by a strengthening of

defensive play in case of a lead), i.e., there is a fundamental component of (positive or

negative) feedback in the system. We do so by introducing such a feedback eﬀect into the

bimodal model (being the discrete version of the Poissonian model (2.1) above): consider a

football match divided into N time steps (we restrict ourselves here to the natural choice

N = 90, but good ﬁts are found for any choice of N within reasonable limits) with both

teams having the possibility to either score or not score in each time step. Feedback is

introduced into the system by having the scoring probabilities p depend on the number n of

goals scored so far, p = p(n). Several possibilities arise. For our model “A”, upon each goal

the scoring probability is modiﬁed as

p(n) = p(n − 1) + κ,

(2.6)

5

with some ﬁxed constant κ (unless p(n − 1) + κ > 1, in which case p(n) = 1, or p(n − 1) +

κ < 0, which is replaced by p(n) = 0). Alternatively, one might consider a multiplicative

modiﬁcation rule,

p(n) = κp(n − 1)

(2.7)

(again modiﬁed to ensure 0 ≤ p(n) ≤ 1), which we refer to as model “B”. The resulting

modiﬁed binomial distributions PN (n) for the total number of goals scored by one team can

be computed exactly from a Pascal type recurrence relation,

PN (n) = [1 − p(n)]PN −1(n) + p(n − 1)PN −1(n − 1),

(2.8)

where, e.g., p(n) = p0 + κn for model “A” and p(n) = p0κn for model “B”. Eq. (2.8) is

intuitively plausible, since n successes in N trials can be reached either from n successes in

N − 1 trials plus a ﬁnal failure or from n − 1 successes in N − 1 trials and a ﬁnal success.

For a more formal proof see the discussion in App. A, where for the additive case of model

“A”, it is also demonstrated that the continuum limit of PN (n), i.e., N → ∞ with p0N

and κN kept ﬁxed, is given by the negative binomial distribution (2.4) with r = p0/κ and

p = 1 − e−κN (note that this also includes the “generalized binomial distribution” considered

in Refs. [25, 26]). Thus the good ﬁt of a negative binomial distribution to the data can be

understood from the “microscopic” eﬀect of self-aﬃrmation of the teams or players, without

making reference to the somewhat poorly motivated composition of the pure Poissonian

model with a gamma distribution. Finally, the assumption of independence of the scoring

of the home and away teams can be relaxed by coupling the adaptation rules upon scoring,

for instance as

ph(n) = ph(n − 1)κh,

pa(n) = pa(n − 1)/κa,

for a goal of the home team,

ph(n) = ph(n − 1)/κh,

pa(n) = pa(n − 1)κa,

for a goal of the away team,

(2.9)

which we refer to as model “C”. If both teams have κ > 1, this results in an incentive for

the scoring team and a demotivation for the opponent. But a value κ < 1 is conceivable as

well. The probability density function PN (nh, na) can be computed recursively as well, cf.

App. A.

Starting from the observation that the goal distributions of certain leagues do not seem

to be well ﬁtted by the negative binomial distribution, Greenhough et al. [8] considered ﬁts

to the data, obtaining good ﬁts in some cases. According to the value of the parameter

ξ, these distributions are known as Weibull (ξ < 0), Gumbel (ξ = 0) and Fr´echet (ξ > 0)

distributions, respectively. As for the case of the negative binomial form as a compound

Poisson distribution, the use of extremal value statistics appears here rather ad hoc. We

would like to point out, however, that the GEV distributions indeed can result from a

modiﬁed microscopical model with feedback. To this end, consider again a series of trials

for a number N of time steps. Assume that the probability to score U1 goals in time step

1 is distributed according to P1(U1) = P (U1) (e.g., with a Poisson distribution P ), the

probability to score U2 goals in time step 2 is P2(U2) = P (U1 + U2)/Z2 etc., such that

Pi(Ui) = P (

i−1
j=1 Uj + Ui)/Zi. For any continuous distribution P , this means that due to
the normalization factors Zi the distribution of Ui will have enhanced tails compared to the

P

distribution of Ui−1 (unless Ui−1 = 0) etc., resulting in a positive feedback eﬀect similar

to that of models “A”, “B” and “C”. We refer to this prescription as model “D”. From

the results of Bertin and Clusel [20, 21] it then follows that the limiting distribution of

the total score n =

N
i=1 Ui is a GEV distribution, where the speciﬁc form of distribution
[in particular the value of the parameter ξ in (2.10)] depends on the falloﬀ of the original

P

distribution P in its tails.

III. DATA AND RESULTS

Concerning football matches played in leagues, our main data set consists of matches

played in Germany, namely for the “Bundesliga” (men’s premier league FRG, 1963/64 –

2004/05, ≈ 12 800 matches), the “Oberliga” (men’s premier league GDR, 1949/50 – 1990/91,

≈ 7700 matches), and for the “Frauen-Bundesliga” (women’s premier league FRG, 1997/98

– 2004/05, ≈ 1050 matches) [27, 28, 29, 30]. Our focus was here to see how in particular

the feedback eﬀects reﬂected in the football score distributions depend on cultural and

political circumstances and are possibly diﬀerent between men’s and women’s leagues. We

ﬁrst determined histograms estimating the probability density functions (PDFs) P h(nh)

7

and P a(na) of the ﬁnal scores of the home and away teams, respectively [31]. Similarly,
we determined histograms for the PDFs P Σ(σ) and P ∆(δ) of the sums and diﬀerences of

ﬁnal scores. To arrive at error estimates on the histogram bins, we utilized the bootstrap

resampling scheme [32].

We ﬁrst considered ﬁts of the PDFs of the phenomenological descriptions considered

previously, namely the Poissonian form (2.1), the negative binomial distribution (2.4) and

the distributions (2.10) of extreme value statistics. The parameters of ﬁts of these types to

the data are summarized in Table I comparing the East German “Oberliga” to the West

German “Bundesliga” (1963/64 – 1990/91, ≈ 8400 matches) during the time of the German

division, and in Table II comparing the data for all games of the German men’s premier

league “Bundesliga” to the German women’s premier league “Frauen-Bundesliga”. Not to

our surprise, and in accordance with previous ﬁndings [3, 8], the simple Poissonian ansatz

(2.1) is not found to be an adequate description for any of the data sets. Deviations occur

here mainly in the tails with large numbers of goals which in general are found to be fatter

than can be accommodated by a Poissonian model, whereas the distribution peaks are

reasonably well represented. On the contrary, the negative binomial form (2.4) models all

of the considered data well as is illustrated with ﬁts of the corresponding form to our data

in Fig. 1 comparing “Oberliga” and “Bundesliga” and in Fig. 2 presenting “Bundesliga”

and “Frauen-Bundesliga”. Comparing the leagues, we ﬁnd that the parameters r of the

NBD ﬁts for the “Bundesliga” are about twice as large as for the “Oberliga”, whereas the

parameters p are smaller for the “Bundesliga”, cf. the data in Table I. Recalling that the

form (2.4) is in fact the continuum limit of the feedback model “A” discussed above, these

diﬀerences translate into larger values of κ and smaller values of p0 for the “Oberliga”

results. That is to say, scoring a goal in a match of the East German premier league

was a more encouraging event than scoring a goal in a match of the West German league.

Alternatively, this observation might be interpreted as a stronger tendency of the perhaps

more professionalized teams of the West German league to switch to a strongly defensive

mode of play in case of a lead. Consequently, the tails of the distributions are slightly

fatter for the “Oberliga” than for the “Bundesliga”. Comparing the results for the “Frauen-

Bundesliga” to those for the “Bundesliga”, even more pronounced tails are found for the

former, resulting in very signiﬁcantly larger values of the self-aﬃrmation parameter κ for

the matches of the women’s league, see the ﬁt parameters collected in Table II and the ﬁts

8

of the NBD type presented in Fig. 2.

Considering the ﬁts of the GEV distributions (2.10) to the data for all three leagues, we

ﬁnd that extreme value statistics are in general a reasonably good description of the data.

The shape parameter ξ is always found to be small in modulus and negative in the majority

of the cases, indicating a distribution of the Weibull type (which is in agreement with the

ﬁndings of Ref. [8]). On the other hand, ﬁxing ξ = 0 yields overall clearly larger values of

χ2 per degree-of-freedom, indicating that the data are hardly compatible with a distribution

of the Gumbel type. Comparing “Oberliga” and “Bundesliga”, we consistently ﬁnd larger

values of the parameter ξ for the former, indicative of the comparatively fatter tails of these

data discussed above, see the data in Table I. The location parameter µ, on the other hand,

is larger for the West German league which features a larger average number of goals per

match (which can be read oﬀ also more directly from the λ parameter of the Poissonian ﬁts),

while the scale parameter σ is similar for both leagues. Comparing to the results for the

NBD, we do not ﬁnd any cases where the GEV distributions would provide the best ﬁt to

the data, so clearly the leagues considered here are not of the type of the general “domestic”

league data for which Greenhough et al. [8] found better matches with the GEV than for

the NBD statistics. Similar conclusions hold true for the comparisons of “Bundesliga” and

“Frauen-Bundesliga”, with the latter taking on the role of the “Oberliga”.

Assuming, for the time being, that the histograms of the ﬁnal scores of the home and

away teams are properly modeled by the ﬁts presented in Tables I and II, it is worthwhile

as a consistency check to see whether the resulting estimates (2.2) and (2.5) of the PDFs

for the Poisson and negative binomial distributions are consistent with the data for the

sums and diﬀerences. Of course, such consistency can only be expected if the histograms of

home and away scores are statistically independent, which assumption certainly is a strongly

simplifying approximation. In Table III we summarize the mean squared deviations χ2 of

the PDFs (2.2) resp. (2.5), evaluated with the parameters of the ﬁts to the home and away

scores of Tables I and II, from the data for the sums and diﬀerences. While again clearly the

Poissonian ansatz disqualiﬁes as an acceptable model of the data, the NBD ﬁts the data for

the “Oberliga” and the “Frauen-Bundesliga” comparatively well, cf. the data in Table III and

the “total” ﬁts in Figs. 1 and 2. For the “Bundesliga”, however, signiﬁcant deviations are

observed. These deviations might go back to an eﬀect of correlation between the home and

9

away scores. To investigate this question we computed the empirical correlation coeﬃcient,

R =

Cov(nh, na)
σ(nh)σ(na)

,

(3.1)

where σ(n) denotes the square root of the variance of n and Cov(nh, na) the covariance of

nh and na. We ﬁnd R = −0.015 ± 0.011 for the “Oberliga” and R = −0.031 ± 0.009 for the

“Bundesliga”, indicating stronger home-away score correlations for the “Bundesliga” [33].

In total, the best ﬁts so far are clearly achieved by the NBD ansatz. Since this distribution

is obtained only as the continuum limit of the microscopic model “A”, it is interesting to

see how ﬁts of the exact distribution (for N = 90) resulting from the recurrence (2.8) for

model “A”, but also ﬁts of the multiplicatively modiﬁed binomial distribution of model “B”

compare to the results found above. We perform ﬁts to the exact distributions of both models

by employing the simplex method [34] to minimize the total χ2 of the data for the home and

away scores. Alternatively, we also considered ﬁtting additionally to the sums and diﬀerences

in a simultaneous ﬁt and found very similar results with an only slight improvement of the

ﬁt quality for the sums and diﬀerences at the expense of somewhat worse ﬁts for the home

and away scores. We summarize the ﬁt results in Table IV. We also performed ﬁts to the

more elaborate model “C”, but found rather similar results to the simpler model “B” and

hence do not present the results here. Comparing the results of model “A” to the ﬁts of

the limiting NBD, we ﬁnd almost identical ﬁt qualities for the ﬁnal scores of both teams.

However, the sums and diﬀerences of scores are considerably better described by model “A”,

indicating that here the deviations from the continuum limit are still relevant. In Fig. 3, we

present the diﬀerences of goals in the German women’s premier league together with the ﬁts

of models “A” and “B”. The multiplicative model “B”, where each goal motivates a team

even more than the previous one, within the statistical errors yields ﬁts of the same quality

as model “A”, such that a distinct advantage cannot be attributed to either of them, cf. the

data in Table IV.

Finally, to leave the realm of German football, we considered the score data of the “FIFA

World Cup” series from 1930 to 2002, focusing on the results from the qualiﬁcation stage

(≈ 3400 matches) [35] [36]. The results of ﬁts of the phenomenological distributions (2.1),

(2.4) and (2.10) as well as the models “A” and “B” are collected in Table V. Compared

to the domestic league data discussed above, the results of the World Cup show distinctly

heavier tails, cf. the presentation of the data in Fig. 4. Considering the ﬁt results, this

10

leads to good ﬁts for the heavy-tailed distributions, and, in particular, in this case the GEV

distribution provides a better ﬁt than the negative binomial model, similar to what was found

by Greenhough et al. [8] for some of their data. This diﬀerence to the German league data

discussed above can be attributed to the possibly very large diﬀerences in skill between the

opposing teams occurring since all countries are allowed to participate in the qualiﬁcation

round. A glance back to Table II reveals a remarkable similarity with the parameters of

the “Frauen-Bundesliga” (e.g., in both cases the NBD parameters p are comparatively large

while r is small, and the GEV parameters ξ are positive), where a similar explanation

appears quite plausible since the very good players are concentrated in two or three teams

only. Turning to the ﬁts of the models “A” and “B”, we again ﬁnd model “A” to ﬁt rather

similar to its continuum approximation, the NBD. On the other hand, model “B” describes

the data extremely well, for the away team even better than the GEV distributions (2.10).

It is, of course, also possible and interesting to analyze the results from the ﬁnal round.

Similar to other cups such as the German “DFB-Pokal” we also considered, the rules are

slightly diﬀerent here, since no game can end in a draw, leading to special correlation eﬀects

in particular in the histograms of the goal diﬀerences. These problems will be investigated

in a forthcoming publication.

IV. SUMMARY

We have considered German domestic and international football score data with respect

to certain phenomenological probability distributions as well as microscopically motivated

models. The Poisson distribution resulting from the assumption of independent scoring prob-

abilities for the opposing teams does not provide a satisfactory ﬁt to any of our data. Many

data sets are rather well described by the negative binomial distribution considered before

[3], however, some cases have heavier tails than can be accommodated by this distribution

and, instead, rather follow a distribution from extreme value statistics.

We have shown that football score data can be understood from a certain class of modiﬁed

binomial models with a built-in eﬀect of self-aﬃrmation of the teams upon scoring a goal.

The negative binomial distribution ﬁtting many of the data sets can in fact be understood

as a limiting distribution of our model “A” with an additive update rule of the scoring

probability.

It is found, however, that the exact distribution of model “A” provides in

11

general rather better ﬁts to the data than the limiting NBD, in particular concerning the

sums and diﬀerences of goals scored. However, it does not provide very good ﬁts in cases

with heavier tails such as the qualiﬁcation round of the “FIFA World Cup” series. The

variant model “B”, on the other hand, where a multiplicative update rule ensures that each

goal motivates the team even more than the previous one, ﬁts these world-cup data as well

as the data from the German domestic leagues extremely well. Thus, the contradicting

evidence for better ﬁts of some football score data with negative binomial and other data

with GEV distributions is reconciled with the use of a plausible microscopic model covering

both cases. We also analyzed results from further leagues, such as the Austrian, Belgian,

British, Bulgarian, Czechoslovak, Dutch, French, Hungarian, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian,

Russian, Scottish and Spanish premier leagues, and arrived at similar conclusions.

Comparing the score data between the separate German premier leagues during the cold

war times, we ﬁnd heavier tails for the East German league. In terms of our microscopic

models, this corresponds to a stronger component of self-aﬃrmation as compared to the West

German league. Similarly, the German women’s premier league “Frauen-Bundesliga” shows

a much stronger feedback eﬀect than the men’s premier league, with at ﬁrst sight surprisingly

many parallels to the “FIFA World Cup” series. In general, we ﬁnd less professionalized

leagues to feature stronger components of positive feedback upon scoring a goal, perhaps

indicating a still stronger infection with the football fever there . . .

It is obvious that the presented models with a single parameter of self-aﬃrmation are a

gross over-simpliﬁcation of the complex psycho-social phenomena on a football pitch. It is all

the more surprising then, how rather well they model the considered score distributions [37].

Naturally, however, a plethora of opportunities for improvement of the description and

further studies opens up. For instance, considering averages over whole leagues or cups,

we have not taken into account the diﬀerences in skill between the teams. Likewise, if

time-resolved scoring data were made available, a closer investigation of the intra-team and

inter-team motivation and demotivation eﬀects would provide an intriguing future enterprise

to undertake.

APPENDIX A: PROBABILISTICS OF CORRELATED BERNOULLI TRIALS

Consider a series of N Bernoulli random variables Ui, i = 1, . . . , N, with probabilities

1 − pi and pi for the outcomes “0” (“failure”) and “1” (“success”), respectively. We are

interested in the distribution PN (

N
i=1 Ui = n) of the number of successes in N trials. For
the limiting case of equal and constant probabilities pi = p, i = 1, . . . , N, the Ui are i.i.d.

P

random variables and PN is given by the binomial distribution

PN (

Ui = n) =

pn (1 − p)N −n,

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

which is a properly normalized (discrete) probability distribution function according to the

binomial theorem. This can be generalized for arbitrary independent choices of probabilities

pi.

We discuss a more general case where, instead, the probabilities pi themselves depend on

the number of previous successes, pi = p(

i−1
k=1 Ui). Due to the introduced correlations, one

should then consider the joint probability distribution of the Ui,

)

from which the desired distribution of successes follows as the marginal PN (n) =

{Ui} P (U1, . . . , UN )δ

Ui,n.

Instead of formally proceeding from (A2) it is more conve-

nient, however, to observe that the distances Dj between subsequent successes are in-

dependent geometrically distributed random variables with probabilities 1 − p(n),

i.e.

P (Dj = dj) = p(j)[1−p(j)]dj −1, j = 0, . . . , n, and the desired marginal distribution becomes

Manipulating this form it is straightforward to prove a Pascal type recurrence relation

for the probabilities PN (n),

PN (n) = [1 − p(n)]PN −1(n) + p(n − 1)PN −1(n − 1),

(A4)

which together with the initial condition P0(0) = 1 and noting that PN (n) = 0 for n > N

allows to construct the distribution with an O(N 2) computational eﬀort compared to the

formal O(2N ) eﬀort implied by Eq. (A2). Multiplying (A4) by un and summing over all n,

one arrives at

where

GN (u) − GN −1(u) = (u − 1)HN −1(u),

GN (u) =

PN (n)un, HN (u) =

p(n)PN (n)un,

∞

n=0
X

such that GN (u) is the generating function of PN (n). The continuum limit N 7→ t is thus

described by the diﬀerential equation

∂G(u, t)
∂t

= (u − 1)H(u, t).

The additive, correlated binomial model discussed in the main text modiﬁes p 7→ p + κ

on each success, unless p + κ > 1 in which case p 7→ 1. Restricting ourselves to the range
of parameters where p < 1, we have p(n) = p0 + κn, HN (u) = p0GN (u) + κu ∂

∂uGN (u) and

Eq. (A7) becomes

∂G(u, t)
∂t

= (u − 1)[p0G(u, t) + κu

G(u, t)],

∂
∂u

which is readily checked to be solved by

G(u, t) = [eκt − u(eκt − 1)]−p0/κ.

(A5)

(A6)

(A7)

(A8)

(A9)

Hence, P (n) has a negative binomial distribution [9, 23],
Pt(n) = e−p0t Γ(p0/κ + n)
n! Γ(p0/κ)

1 − e−κt

=

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

pn(1 − p)r,

(A10)

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

where r = p0/κ and p = 1 − e−κt. For Nκ = const < 1, this continuum approximation is

appropriate in the same limit where the Poissonian distribution is a valid approximation for

the binomial distribution (A1), i.e., for N ≫ 1 with Npo = const.

For the multiplicative, correlated binomial model, after each success the probability is

modiﬁed as p 7→ κp (unless κp > 1, in which case p 7→ 1), such that p(j) = p0κj for the

range of parameters where p(n) < 1. In this case, the diﬀerential equation (A7) becomes

∂G(u, t)
∂t

= (u − 1)p0G(κu, t).

(A11)

Note that due to the diﬀerent ﬁrst arguments of G, this is not an ordinary diﬀerential

equation. We currently do not see how the solution could be expressed in terms of elementary

or special functions in this case. Still, the distribution PN (n) can be easily computed from

the recurrence (A4) [38].

lead to a recurrence relation

Finally, for the case of two coupled, correlated binomial distributions with probabilities

pA for “success A”, pB for “success B” and (1 − pA − pB) for “failure”, similar considerations

PN (nA, nB) = [1 − pA(nA, nB) − pB(nA, nB)]PN −1(nA, nB) +

pA(nA − 1, nB)PN −1(nA − 1, nB) +

pB(nA, nB − 1)PN −1(nA, nB − 1),

(A12)

from which the distributions PN (nA, nB) for the model variants “A”, “B” and “C” can be

easily computed in O(N 3) time.

[36] We disregarded all games played in tournaments on neutral grounds.

[37] Also, on this level of abstraction it cannot be excluded that we are, in fact, observing an

eﬀect of spurious contagion as occurring for the negative bimodal distribution, which results

as limiting distribution from non-contagious situations (as compound Poisson distribution)

and contagious models (our model “A”). See also Ref. [24].

[38] Alternatively, PN (n) is the coeﬃcient of the zN term of the power series expansion of

[1 − q(n)z]−1

in powers of z, where q(j) = 1 − p(j). We thank O. Penrose for pointing this out to us. Using

a saddle-point calculation for the Cauchy integral representation of PN (n), a very accurate

closed-form approximation can be derived, which will be reported elsewhere.

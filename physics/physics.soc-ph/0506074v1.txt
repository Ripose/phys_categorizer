(Dated: September 24, 2013)

Public transport systems in 22 Polish cities have been analyzed. Sizes of these networks range
from N = 152 to N = 2881. Depending on the assumed deﬁnition of network topology the degree
distribution can follow a power law or can be described by an exponential function. Distributions
of paths in all considered networks are given by asymmetric, unimodal functions. Clustering, assor-
tativity and betweenness are studied. All considered networks exhibit small world behavior and are
hierarchically organized. A transition between dissortative small networks N <
∼ 500 and assortative
large networks N >

∼ 500 is observed.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Since the explosion of the complex network science
that has taken place after works of Watts and Stro-
gatz [1] as well as Barab´asi and Albert [2, 3] a lot of
real-world networks have been examined. The exam-
ples are technological networks (Internet, phone calls
network), biological systems (food webs, metabolic sys-
tems) or social networks (co-authorship, citation net-
works) [4, 5, 6, 7]. Despite this, at the beginning
little attention has been paid to transportation net-
works - mediums as much important and also sharing
as much complex structure as those previously listed.
However, during the last few years several public trans-
port systems (PTS) have been investigated using vari-
ous concepts of statistical physics of complex networks
[8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21].

Chronogically the ﬁrst works regarding transportation
networks have dealt with power grids [1, 2, 8, 9]. One
can argue that transformators and transmission lines
underground,
have little in common with PTS (i.e.
buses and tramways), but they deﬁnitely share at least
one common feature: embedding in a two-dimensional
space. Research done on the electrical grid in United
States - for Southern California [1, 2, 8, 9] and for the
whole country [10] as well as on the GRTN Italian power
network [11] revealed a single-scale degree distributions
(p(k) ∝ exp(−αk) with α ≈ 0.5), a small average connec-
tivity values and relatively large average path lengths.

All railway and underground systems appear to share
well known small-world properties [1]. Moreover this
kind of networks possesses several other characteristic
features.
In fact Latora and Marichiori have stud-
ied in details a network formed by the Boston subway
[12, 13, 14]. They have calculated a network eﬃciency
deﬁned as a mean value of inverse distances between
network nodes. Although the global eﬃciency is quite
large Eglob = 0.63 the local eﬃciency calculated in the
subgraphs of neighbors is low Elocal = 0.03 what indi-
cates a large vulnerability of this network against acci-
dental damages. However, the last parameter increases
local = 0.46 if the subway network is extended by
to E

′

the existing bus routes network. Taking into account ge-
ographical distances between diﬀerent metro stations one
can consider the network as a weighted graph and one is
able to introduce a measure of a network cost. The es-
timated relative cost of the Boston subway is around 0.2
% of the total cost of fully connected network.

Sen et al.

[15] have introduced a new topology de-
scribing the system as a set of train lines, not stops, and
they have discovered a clear exponential degree distribu-
tion in Indian railway network. This system has shown
a small negative value of assortativity coeﬃcient. Seaton
and Hackett [16] have compared real data from under-
ground systems of Boston (ﬁrst presented in [14]) and Vi-
enna with the prediction of bipartite graph theory (here:
graph of lines and graph of stops) using generation func-
tion formalism. They have found a good correspondence
regarding value of average degree, however other proper-
ties like clustering coeﬃcient or network size have shown
diﬀerences of 30 to 50 percent.

In works of Amaral, Barrat, Guimer`a et al.

[8, 17,
18, 19] a survey on the World-Wide Airport Network
has been presented. The authors have proposed trun-
cated power-law cumulative degree distribution P (k) ∝
k−αf (k/kx) with the exponent α = 1.0 and a model of
preferential attachment where a new node (ﬂight) is in-
troduced with a probability given by a power-law or an
exponential function of physical distance between con-
nected nodes. However, only an introduction of geo-
political constrains [19] (i.e. only large cities are allowed
to establish international connections) explained the be-
havior of betweenness as a function of node degree.

Other works on airport networks in India [20] and
China [21] have stressed small-world properties of those
systems, characterized by small average path lengths
(hli ≈ 2) and large clustering coeﬃcients (c > 0.6) with
comparison to random graph values. Degree distribu-
tions have followed either a power-law (India) or a trun-
cated power-law (China). In both cases an evidence of
strong disassortative degree-degree correlation has been
discovered and it also appears that Airport Network of
India has a hierarchical structure expressed by a power-
law decay of clustering coeﬃcient with an exponent equal

2

to 1.

In the present paper we have studied a part of data
for PTS in 22 Polish cities and we have analyzed their
nodes degrees, path lengths, clustering coeﬃcients, as-
sortativity and betweenness. Despite large diﬀerences
in sizes of considered networks (number of nodes ranges
from N = 152 to N = 2881) they share several universal
features such as degree and path length distributions, log-
arithmic dependence of distances on nodes degrees or a
power law decay of clustering coeﬃcients for large nodes
degrees. As far as we know, our results are the ﬁrst com-
parative survey of several public transport systems in the
same country using universal tools of complex networks.

II. THE IDEA OF SPACE L AND P

FIG. 2: Map of examined cities in Poland.

To analyze various properties of PTS one should start
with a deﬁnition of a proper network topology. The idea
of the space L and P, proposed in a general form in [15]
and used also in [16] is presented at Fig. 1. The ﬁrst
topology (space L) consists of nodes representing bus,
tramway or underground stops and a link between two
nodes exists if they are consecutive stops on the route.
The node degree k in this topology is just the number
of directions (it is usually twice the number of all PTS
routes) one can take from a given node while the distance
l equals to the total number of stops on the path from
one node to another.

FIG. 1: Explanation of the space L (a) and the space P (b).

Although nodes in the space P are the same as in the
previous topology, here an edge between two nodes means
that there is a direct bus, tramay or underground route
that links them.
In other words, if a route A consists
of nodes ai, i.e. A = {a1, a2, ..., an}, then in the space
P the nearest neighbors of the node a1 are a2, a3, ..., an.
Consequently the node degree k in this topology is the
total number of nodes reachable using a single route and
the distance can be interpreted as a number of transfers
(plus one) one has to take to get from one stop to another.
Another idea of mapping a structure embedded in two-
dimensional space into another, dimensionless topology
has recently been used by Rosvall et al. in [22] where a

plan of the city roads has been mapped into an ”informa-
tion city network”. In the last topology a road represents
a node and an intersection between roads - an edge, so
the network shows information handling that has to be
performed to get oriented in the city.

III. EXPLORED SYSTEMS

We have analyzed PTS (bus and tramways systems)
in 22 Polish cities, located in various state districts as
it is depicted at Fig. 2. Table I gathers fundamental
parameters of considered cities and data on average path
lengths, average degrees, clustering coeﬃcients as well as
assortativity coeﬃcients for corresponding networks.

Numbers of nodes in diﬀerent networks range from
N = 152 to N = 2811, and they are roughly propor-
tional to populations I and surfaces S of correspond-
ing cities (see Fig. 3). One should notice that other
surveys exploring the properties of transportation net-
works have usually dealt with smaller numbers of ver-
tices, such as N = 76 for U-Bahn network in Vienna
[16], N = 79 for Airport Network of India (ANI) [21],
N = 124 in Boston Underground Transportation System
(MBTA) [14] or N = 128 in Airport Network of China
(ANC) [20]. Only in the case of the Indian Railway Net-
work (IRN) [15] where N = 579 and World-Wide Airport
Network (WAN) [19] with 3880 nodes sizes of networks
have been similar or larger than for PTS in Poland.

IV. DEGREE DISTRIBUTIONS

A. Degree distribution in the space L

Fig. 4 shows typical plots for degree distribution in the
space L. One can see that there is a slightly better ﬁt to
the linear behavior in the log-log description as compared
to semi-logarithmic plots. Points k = 1 are very peculiar
since they correspond to routes’ ends. Remaining parts

with characteristic exponents γ between 2.4 and 4.1
(see Table II), with the majority (15 out of 22) γ > 3.
Values of exponents γ are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the
value γ = 3 which is characteristic for Barab´asi-Albert
model of evolving networks with preferential attachment
[3] and one can suppose that a corresponding model for
transport network evolution should include several other
eﬀects. In fact various models taking into account eﬀects
of ﬁtness, atractiveness, accelerated growth and aging of
vertices [25] or deactivation of nodes [26, 27] lead to γ
from a wide range of values γ ∈ h2, ∞). One should also
notice that networks with a characteristic exponent γ > 4
are considered topologically close to random graphs [24]
- the degree distribution is very narrow - and a diﬀerence
between power-law and exponential behavior is very sub-
tle (see the Southern California power grid distribution
in [2] presented as a power-law with γ ≈ 4 and in [9]
depicted as a single-scale cumulative distribution).

of degree distributions can be approximately described
by a power law

nential cutoﬀ (in the case of WAN). For all those systems
exponent γ is in the range of 2.0 − 2.2, which diﬀers sig-
niﬁcantly from considered PTS in Poland, however one
has to notice, that airport networks are much less de-
pendent on the two-dimensional space as it is in the case
of PTS. This eﬀect is also seen when analyzing average
connectivity (hki = 5.77 for ANI, hki = 9.7 for WAN and
hki = 12 − 14 for ANC depending on the day of the week
the data have been collected).

Let us notice that the number of nodes of degree k = 1
is smaller as compared to the number of nodes of degree
k = 2 since k = 1 nodes are ends of transport routes.
The maximal probability observed for nodes with degree
k = 2 means that a typical stop is directly connected
to two other stops. Still some nodes (hubs) can have a
relatively high degree value (in some cases above 10) but
the number of such vertices is very small.

B. Degree distribution in the space P

In our opinion, the key structure for the analysis of
PTS are routes and not single bus/tramway stops. There-
fore we especially take under consideration the degree
distribution in the space P.

To smooth large ﬂuctuations, we use here the cumula-

tive distribution P (k) [5] according to the formula

P (k) =

p(k)dk

(2)

kmax

k

P (k) = Ae−αk

(3)

As it is well known [3] the exponential distribution (3)
can occur for evolving networks when nodes are attached
completely randomly. This suggests that a correspond-
ing evolution of public transport in the space P pos-
sesses an accidental character that can appear because
of large number of factors responsible for urban develop-
ment. However in the next sections we show that other
network’s parameters such as clustering coeﬃcients or
degree-degree correlations calculated for PTS are much
larger as compared to corresponding values of randomly
evolving networks analyzed in [3].

In the case of IRN [15] degree distribution in the space
P has also maintained the single-scale character P (k) ∼
e−αk with the characteristic exponent α = 0.0085. Val-
ues of average connectivity in the studies of MBTA
(hki = 27.60) and U-Bahn in Vienna (hki = 20.66) are
smaller than for considered systems in Poland, however
one should notice that sizes of networks in MBTA and
Vienna are also smaller.

C. Average degree and average square degree

Taking into account

the normalization condition
P (kmin) = 1 we get the following equations for the aver-
age degree and the average square degree:

A. Path length’s distributions

Plots presenting path length distributions p(l) in
spaces L and P are shown at Figs. 8 and 9 respectively.

where A, B and C are ﬁtting coeﬃcients.
Inserts at Figs. 8 and 9 present a comparison between
experimental results of hli and corresponding mean val-
ues obtained from Eq. (8). One can observe a very good
agreement between averages from Eq.
(8) and experi-
mental data.

Ranges of distances in the space L are much broader as
compared to corresponding ranges in the space P what is
a natural eﬀect of topology diﬀerences. It follows that the
average distance in the space P is much smaller (hli < 3)
than in the space L. The characteristic length 3 in the
space P means that in order to travel between two diﬀer-

quite large and such a behavior gives the eﬀect of ob-
served long tails in the distribution. On the other hand
shortest distances between stops not belonging to subur-
ban routes are more random and they follow the Gaussian
distribution. A combined distribution has an asymmetric
shape with a long tail for large paths.

We need to stress that inter-node distances calculated
in the space L are much smaller as compared to the num-
ber of network nodes (see Table I). Simultaneously clus-
tering coeﬃcients cL are in the range h0.03, 0.15i. Such
a behavior is typical for small-world networks [1] and the
eﬀect has been also observed in other transport networks
[8, 14, 15, 16, 20, 21] . The small world property is
even more visible in the space P where average distances
are between h1.80, 2.90i and the clustering coeﬃcient cP
ranges from 0.682 to 0.847 which is similar to MBTA
(c = 0.93), Vienna (c = 0.95) or IRN (c = 0.69).

B. Path length as function of product kikj

In [28] an analytical estimation of average path length
hli in random graphs has been found. It has been shown
that hli can be expressed as a function of the degree dis-
tribution. In fact the mean value for shortest path length
between i and j can be written as [28]:

ent points one needs in average no more than two trans-
fers. Other PTS also share this property, depending on
the system size the following results have been obtained:
hli = 1.81 (MBTA), hli = 1.86 (Vienna), hli = 2.16
(IRN). In the case of the space L the network MBTA
with its average shortest path length hli = 15.55 is plac-
ing itself among the values acquired for PTS in Poland.
Average path length in airport networks is very small:
hli = 2.07 for ANC, hli = 2.26 for ANI and hli = 4.37
for WAN. However, because ﬂights are usually direct (i.e.
there are no stops between two cities) one sees imme-
diately that the idea of the space L does not apply to
airport networks - they already have an intrinsic topol-
ogy similar to the space P. Average shortest path lengths
hli in those systems should be relevant to values obtained
for other networks after a transformation to the space P.
The shape of path length distribution can be explained
in the following way: because transport networks tend to
have an inhomogeneous structure, it is obvious that dis-
tances between nodes lying on the suburban routes are

FIG. 10: Dependence of lij on kikj in the space L

Since PTS are not random graphs and large degree-
degree correlation in such networks exist we have as-
sumed that Eq. (9) is only partially valid and we have
written it a more general form [29, 30, 31, 32]:

hliji = A − B log kikj.

(10)

To check the validity of Eq. (10) we have calculated
values of average path length between lij as a function
of their degree product kikj for all systems in the space
L . The results are shown at Fig. 10, which conﬁrms the
conjunction (10). A similar agreement has been received
for the majority of investigated PTS. Eq. (10) can be
justiﬁed using a simple model of random graphs and a
generating function formalism [33] or a branching tree
approach [29, 30, 31, 32].
In fact the scaling relation
(10) can be also observed for several other real world
networks [29, 30, 31, 32].

It is useless to examine the relation (10) in the space P
because corresponding sets lij consist usually of 3 points
only.

VI. CLUSTERING COEFFICIENT

We have studied clustering coeﬃcients ci deﬁned as a
probability that two randomly chosen neighbors of node
i possess a common link.

The clustering coeﬃcient of the whole network seems
to depend weakly on parameters of the space L and of
the space P. In the ﬁrst case its behavior with regard
to network size can be treated as ﬂuctuations, when in
the second one it is possible to observe a small decrease
of c along with the networks size (see Table I). We shall
discuss only properties of the clustering coeﬃcients in the
space P since the data in the space L are meaningless.

It has been shown in [15] that clustering coeﬃcient in
IRN in the space P decays linearly with the logarithm of
degree for large k and is almost constant (and close to
unity) for small k. In the considered PTS we have found
that this dependency can be described by a power law
(see Fig. 11):

c(k) ∼ k−β

(11)

Such a behavior has been observed in many real sys-
tems with hierarchical structures [35, 36].
In fact, one
can expect that PTS should consist of densely connected
modules linked by longer paths.

Observed values of exponents β are in the range β ∈
h0.54, 0.93i. This can be explained using a simple ex-
ample of a star network: suppose that the city transport
network is a star consisting of n routes with L stops each.
Node i, at which all n routes cross is a vertex that has the
highest degree in the network. We do not allow any other
crossings among those n routes in the whole system. It
follows that the degree of node i is ki = n(L − 1) and the
total number of links among the nearest neighbors of i
is Ei = n(L − 1)(L − 2)/2. In other words the value of
the clustering coeﬃcient for the node with the maximum
degree is:

c(kmax) =

2Ei
ki(ki − 1)

L − 2
n(L − 1) − 1

β = 0.81 ± 0.02 and Warszawa - β = 0.57 ± 0.01. All data are
logarithmically binned with the power of 1.25.

where kmax = n(L − 1). It is obvious that the minimal
degree in the network is kmin = L − 1 and this correspon-
dences to the value c(kmin) = 1. Using these two points
and assuming that we have a power-law behavior we can
express β as:

β = −

ln c(kmax) − ln c(kmin)
ln kmax − ln kmin

= −

ln

L−2
n(L−1)−1

ln n

(13)

Because n(L−1) ≫ 1 and L−1 ≈ L−2 we have β ≈ 1.
In real systems the value of clustering coeﬃcient of the
highest degree node is larger than in Eq. (12) due to mul-
tiple crossings of routes in the whole network what leads
to a decrease of the exponent β (see Fig. 11). This de-
crease is also connected to the presence of degree-degree
correlations (see the next Section).

VII. DEGREE-DEGREE CORRELATIONS

To analyze degree-degree correlations in PTS we have
used the assortativity coeﬃcient r, proposed by Newman
[34] in the form of:

r =

where M - number of edges, ji, ki - degrees of vertices

at both ends of i-th edge.

Values of the assortativity coeﬃcient r in the space L
are independent of the network size and are always pos-
itive (see Table I), what can be explained in the follow-
ing way: there is a little number of nodes characterized
by high values of degrees k and they are usually linked

other node is ko = L − 1, after some algebra we receive
the following expression for the assortativity coeﬃcient
of such a star network:

 

r = −

1
L − 1

(15)

Let us notice that the coeﬃcient r is independent from
the number of crossing routes and is always a negative
number.

On the contrary, in the large cities there are lots of con-
nections between nodes characterized by large k (trans-
port hubs) as well as there is a large number of routes
crossing in more than one point (see Fig. 13). It follows
that the coeﬃcient r can be positive for such networks.
A strange behavior for the largest network (GOP) can
be explained as an eﬀect of its peculiar structure: the
system is rather a conglomerate of many towns than a
single city. Thus, the value of r is lowered by single links
between the subsets of this network.

At Fig. 14 we show coeﬃcients β as a function of r in
the space P. One can see that in general positive values
of the assortativity coeﬃcient correspond to lower values
of β, being an eﬀect of existence of several links between
hubs in the networks.

Reported values of assortativity coeﬃcients in other
transport networks have been negative (r = −0.402 for
ANI [20] and r = −0.033 for IRN [15]) and since these
systems are of the size N < 600 thus it is in agreement
with our results.

FIG. 13: Crossing of 4 routes of 5 stops each. (a) In the star
example there is only one hub and assortativity coeﬃcient is
equal to r = −0.25 according to Eq. (15). In case (b) a few
hubs exist due to a multiple crossing of routes and r = −0.19.
Upper diagrams - the space L, lower diagrams - the space P.

Similar calculations performed for the space P lead to
completely diﬀerent results (Fig. 12). For small networks
the correlation parameter r is negative and it grows with
N , becoming positive for N >
∼ 500. The dependence can
be explained as follows: small towns are described by
star structures and there are only a few doubled routes,
so in this space a lot of links between vertices of small
and large k exist. Using the previous example of a star
network and taking into account that the degree of the
central node is equal to kc = n(L − 1), the degree of any

VIII. BETWEENNESS

The last property of PTS examined in this work is be-
tweenness [37] which is the quantity describing the ”im-
portance” of a speciﬁc node according to equation [38]:

observed in Internet Autonomous Systems [40], co-
authorship networks [41] and BA model or Erd˝os-R´enyi
random graphs [38].

The coeﬃcient η is plotted at Fig. 16 as a function
of network size. One can see, that η is getting closer
to 2 for large networks. Since it has been shown that
there is η = 2 for random graphs [38] with Poisson degree
distribution thus it can suggest that large PTS are more
random than small ones. Such an interpretation can be
also received from the Table II where larger values of the
exponent γ are observed for large cities.

B. Betweenness in the space P

(17)

The betweenness as a function of node degree k in the
space P is shown at Fig. 17. One can see large diﬀer-
ences between Fig. 15 and 17. In the space P there is a
saturation of hgi for small k what is a result of existence
of the suburban routes while the scale-free behavior oc-
curs only for larger k. The saturation value observed in
the limit of small k is given by hg(kmin)i = 2(N − 1) and
the length of the saturation line increases with the mean
value of a single route’s length observed in a city.

IX. CONCLUSIONS

In this study we have collected and analyzed data for
public transport networks in 22 cities that make over
25 % of population in Poland. Sizes of these networks
range from N = 152 to N = 2881. Using the concept
of diﬀerent network topologies we show that in the space
L, where distances are measured in numbers of passed
bus/tramway stops, the degree distributions are approx-
imately given by a power laws with γ = 2.4 − 4.1 while

in the space P, where distances are measured in numbers
of transfers, the degree distribution is exponential with
characteristic exponents α = 0.013−0.050. Distributions
of paths in both topologies are approximately given by a
function p(l) = Ale−Bl
+Cl. Small world behavior is ob-
served in both topologies but it is much more pronounced
in space P where the hierarchical structure of network is
also deduced from the behavior of c(k). The assortativ-
ity coeﬃcient measured in the space L remains positive
for the whole range of N while in the space P it changes
from negative values for small networks to positive values
for large systems. In the space L distances between two
stops are linear functions of the logarithm of their degree

products.

Many of our results are similar to features observed in
other works regarding transportation networks: under-
ground, railway or airline systems [8, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,
17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. All such networks tend to share small-
world properties and show strong degree-degree correla-
tions that reveal complex nature of those structures.

Scaling theory of temporal correlations and size dependent ﬂuctuations in the traded

(Dated: 26th September 2013)

Records of the traded value fi of stocks display ﬂuctuation scaling, a proportionality between
the standard deviation σi and the average hfii: σi ∝ hfiiα, with a strong time scale dependence
α(∆t). The non-trivial (i.e., neither 0.5 nor 1) value of α may have diﬀerent origins and provides
information about the microscopic dynamics. We present a set of recently discovered stylized facts,
and then show their connection to such behavior. The functional form α(∆t) originates from two
aspects of the dynamics: Stocks of larger companies both tend to be traded in larger packages, and
also display stronger correlations of traded value.

INTRODUCTION

tions are reﬂected in the time scale dependence of the
exponent α.

Research concerning the forces that govern stock mar-
kets is largely helped by the abundant availability of data
on trading activity [1, 2]. Recently an increasing num-
ber of complex systems have been studied in a similar,
data-oriented way [3, 4]. Examples include records of in-
formation ﬂow through routers on the Internet, or of web
page visitations [5, 6]. The means to extract information
from such multichannel data are generally limited to the
system-wide distributions of various quantities and cross-
correlation measurements. Although these approaches
have been very fruitful in various areas, they often fail to
provide information on the mechanisms that govern the
observed internal processes. On the grounds of a recently
discovered set of empirical facts regarding stock market
trading activity [7, 8, 9, 10], we apply a new tool [5] to
address these questions. This is based on an empirical
scaling law that appears to hold for most systems.
It
connects the ﬂuctuations σi and the average hfii of the
activity of constituents by a ﬂuctuation scaling law:

σi ∝ hfiiα .

The value of α is a ﬁngerprint of the dominant factors of
internal dynamics. This paper is aimed at understanding
the emergence of such scaling – in a ﬁnancial context.

Section II introduces notations and our set of stock
market data. Section III presents some recently discov-
ered stylized facts regarding stock market trading activ-
ity, and then Section IV describes the concept of ﬂuctua-
tion scaling that connects all those observations. In par-
ticular, we outline two universality classes: α = 0.5 and
α = 1. Then, we deal with a mechanism that explains
how stock markets can display a non-universal value of
α ≈ 0.68. Finally, we describe how dynamical correla-

II. NOTATIONS AND DATA

For our analysis of ﬁnancial data, it is necessary to
give a few deﬁnitions. For a time window size ∆t, one
can write the total traded value of the ith stock at time
t in the form

f ∆t
i

(t) =

Vi(n),

(1)

Xn,ti(n)∈[t,t+∆t]

where ti(n) is the time of the n-th transaction of stock i.
The so called tick-by-tick data is denoted by Vi(n), this
is the value traded in transaction n. It can be calculated
as the product of the price p and the traded volume ˜V :
Vi(n) = pi(n) ˜Vi(n).

(2)

The price serves as a weighting factor to make the com-
parison of diﬀerent stocks possible, while this deﬁnition
also eliminates the eﬀect of stock splits.

As the source of empirical data, we used the TAQ
database [11] which records all transactions of the New
York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and NASDAQ for the
years 2000 − 2002. Our sample was restricted to those
2647 stocks for NYSE and 4039 for NASDAQ, that were
continuously traded in the period.

Finally, note that we use 10-base logarithms through-
out the paper to ease the understanding of ﬁnancial data.

III. STYLIZED FACTS OF TRADING
ACTIVITY

This section presents a few recent advances [8] in un-
derstanding the empirical properties of trading activity.
Their focus is on the the fundamental role of company
size. This is usually measured by the capitalization, but
it is closely related to the trading frequency, which in
turn inﬂuences a very broad range of statistical proper-
ties observed in data.

A. Size-dependent correlations

The presence of long-range autocorrelations in various
measures of trading is a well-known fact [8, 9, 10]. For
example, stock market volatility [1, 2, 12] and trading
volumes [8, 13] show strong persistence. Correlations can
be characterized by the Hurst exponent H(i) [14, 15]. For
stock i, this is deﬁned[28] as

σ(i, ∆t) =

f ∆t

∝ ∆tH(i),

(cid:11)(cid:1)

where h·i denotes time averaging. There is a range of
methods [15, 16, 17] to estimate the Hurst exponent,
and the understanding of the results is well established
[14]. The signal is said to be correlated (persistent) when
H > 0.5, uncorrelated when H = 0.5, and anticorrelated
(antipersistent) for H < 0.5.

It is intriguing, that stock market activity has a much
richer behavior, than simply all stocks having Hurst ex-
ponents statistically distributed around an average value
H(i) ∼ H, as assumed in [13].
Instead, there is a
crossover [8, 9, 10] between to types of behavior around
the time scale of 1 day. We located this threshold by
a technique that will be discussed in Section IV C. An
essentially uncorrelated regime was found when ∆t < 20
min for NYSE and ∆t < 2 min for NASDAQ, while the
time series of larger companies become strongly corre-
lated when ∆t > 300 min for NYSE and ∆t > 60 min for
NASDAQ. As a reference, we also calculated the Hurst
exponents Hshuf f (i) of the shuﬄed time series. Results
are given in Figs. 1 and 2.

One can see, that for shorter time windows, correla-
tions are absent in both markets, H(i) ≈ 0.51 − 0.53.
For windows longer than a trading day, however, while
small hf i stocks again display only very weak correla-
tions, larger ones show up to H ≈ 0.9. Furthermore,
there is a distinct logarithmic trend in the data:

H(i) = H ∗ + γ log hfii ,

(4)

with γ(∆t > 300min) = 0.06 ± 0.01 for NYSE and
γ(∆t > 60min) = 0.05 ± 0.01 for NASDAQ. Shorter time
scales correspond to the special case γ = 0, there is no
systematic trend in H. Shuﬄed data, as expected, show
Hshuf f (i) ≈ 0.5 at all time scales and without signiﬁcant
dependence on hfii.

It is to be emphasized, that the crossover is not simply
It is in-
between uncorrelated and correlated regimes.
stead between homogeneous (all stocks show H(i) ≈ H1,
γ = 0) and inhomogeneous (γ > 0) behavior. One ﬁnds
H1 ≈ 0.5, but very small hf i stocks do not depart much
from this value even for large time windows. This is a
clear relation to company size, as hf i is a monotonously
growing function of company capitalization [8]. Depen-
dence of the eﬀect on hf i is in fact a dependence on com-
pany size.

pends logarithmically on the mean trading activity of the

ponents are 0.53 and 0.93; the slope for shuﬄed data is 0.51.

B. Fluctuation scaling of f

This paper will mainly focus on a special property of
the time series f ∆t
(t): ﬂuctuation scaling [5, 6, 7]. This
connects the standard deviation σi and the average hfii
of the trading activity for all our i = 1 . . . N stocks:

i

σ(i, ∆t) ∝ hfiiα(∆t) .

(5)

We carried out this analysis similarly to our earlier study
[7]. However, due to the long time period (3 years), the
data are highly instationary, thus here we have applied
the DFA procedure [15, 16] to estimate σ(∆t, i). We
determined the values of α for traded value ﬂuctuations
by ﬁts to (5), examples are shown in Fig. 3.

The exponent α strongly depends on the size ∆t of the
time windows. Recently, Refs.
[10, 18, 19] pointed out
that the trading activity of NYSE and NASDAQ display
very diﬀerent temporal correlations, possibly due to their
diﬀerent trading mechanisms. Still, the scaling (5) holds
regardless of market or ∆t. Furthermore, their functions
α(∆t) agree qualitatively. The exponents are shown for
NYSE and NASDAQ in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b), respectively.
One can see, that α is a non-decreasing function of ∆t,
and in large regimes it is, to a good approximation, either
constant or logarithmic.

changed in the n’th trade of stock i. The corresponding
variance will be σ2

V (i, ∆t).

Dimensional analysis predicts

V i ∝ hVii2 ,
σ2

which is remarkably close to the actual behavior, shown
in Fig. 5(a). Also, when the size of the time windows is
chosen suﬃciently small (∆t ≪ 1 min), then the prob-
ability that two trades of the same stock happen in the
same period is negligible. In this limit, correlations be-
tween consecutive trades cannot contribute to σ2

central limit theorem becomes applicable, and simply

which again agrees very well with empirical data shown
for ∆t = 1 sec in Fig. 5(b). The further analysis of this
relation is beyond the scope of our paper.

D. Dependence of typical trade size on trading
frequency

The ﬁnal observation to be discussed here is that for a
large group of stocks, the average rate of trades hN i and
their mean value hV i are connected by a power law:

hVii ∝ hNiiβ .

(8)

Such relationships are shown in Figs.
6(a) and 6(b)
for NYSE and NASDAQ, respectively. The measured
exponents are βN Y SE = 0.59 ± 0.09 and βN ASDAQ =
0.22 ± 0.04, although they are restricted to large enough
stocks. The estimate based on Ref. [20] for the stocks in
London’s FTSE-100, is β ≈ 1. One very crude interpre-
tation of the eﬀect is the following. Smaller stocks are
exchanged rarely, but transaction costs must limit from
below the value that is still proﬁtable to be exchanged at
once. This minimal unit is around the order of 104 USD
for both markets. Once the speed of trading and liquid-
ity grow, it becomes possible to exchange larger pack-
ages. Trades start to ”stick together”, their average value
starts to grow. Although this tendency reduces transac-
tion costs, the price impact [21, 22, 23, 24] of the trade
also increases, which in practice often limits package sizes
from above. These two mechanisms may have a role in
the formation of (8).

C. Fluctuation scaling of N and V

One can carry out a similar analysis of other quanti-
ties. Here we limit ourself to two of these. The ﬁrst one,

This phenomenon is by no means speciﬁc to stock mar-
ket data, in fact it has been observed for activity in a
wide range of complex systems. Possible choices for f
include data traﬃc through Internet routers, daily web
page hits, highway traﬃc [5, 6] and node visitations of
random walkers on complex networks [5, 25]. Some an-
alytical and measurement results are shown in Table I,
along with constants β and γ that will be discussed later.
In this sense, the stock market is seen as a complex sys-
tem, where the constituents are stocks and their activity
at any time is given by the traded value per unit time.

First, notice that (3) and (5) are formal analogues.
They connect the same standard deviation with the two
complementary factors: the ∆t size of the time window
and the average (trading) activity hfii. There is evidence,
that while H(i) describes the correlation properties of the
individual elements activity, the function α(∆t) carries
information about the collective dynamical properties of
the whole system. Based on this knowledge, a classiﬁca-
tion scheme was outlined in Refs.
[5, 25, 26] All those
studies assume, that the activities of all nodes are uncor-
related, i.e., H(i) = 0.5.[29] In this case, there are two
known universality classes with respect to the value of α.
In certain systems, the activity of the constituents
comes from nearly equivalent, independent events. The
diﬀerence between nodes with smaller and greater mean
activity comes basically from the diﬀerent mean number
of events. Then, the central limit theorem can be applied
to these events and this yields α = 0.5 automatically.
Examples include simple surface growth models and the

data traﬃc of Internet routers [5].

Other systems dynamics is under a dominant external
driving force: Activity ﬂuctuations are mainly caused by
the variations of this external force, and this leads to
proportionality between the strength and the standard

deviations at the nodes: α = 1, regardless of the internal
structure or the laws governing the time evolution. This
is observed for the statistics of web page visitations and
highway traﬃc [5].

In temporally uncorrelated systems, two processes are
known to give rise to intermediate measured values 0.5 <
α < 1: Some ﬁnite systems display a crossover between
α = 0.5 and α = 1 at a certain node strength hf i, due to
the competition of external driving and internal dynamics
[5, 6]. There is an eﬀective value of α, but in fact, scaling
breaks down. Another possible scenario is discussed in
the following.

B. Non-universal values of α

The activities fi(t) originate from individual events
that take place at the nodes. Every event at a node i
is characterized by its time ti(n) and its size or impact
Vi(n) which is now allowed to vary. For a given size of
time windows ∆t, the observed time series is given by

f ∆t
i

(t) =

Vi(n),

Xn,ti(n)∈[t,t+∆t]

a formula equivalent to (1).
In the stock market, the
value exchanged in a trade is a plausible choice of the
impact variable.

If the random process that gives the impact of an event
is independent of the one that determines when the event
occurs, one can ﬁnd a simple formula [25] that shows how
ﬂuctuations of f are composed:

i = σ2
σ2

V i hNii + σ2

N i hVii2 ,

(9)

where hVii and σ2
V i are the mean and the standard de-
viation of the event size distribution. hNii and σ2
N i are
similar, only for the number of events in time windows of
length ∆t. Under these conditions, it is also trivial, that
hfii = hNii hVii.

All the above can be expected from simple principles.
Two more relationships are necessary and are often real-
ized, they are basically the same as (6) and (7). The only
strong assumption to account for non-universal values of
α is the following. Consider a system, where elements

with higher average activity do not only experience more
events, but those also have a larger impact. Let us as-
sume scaling between the two quantities:

hVii ∝ hNiiβ ,

which is equivalent to (8). Then, α can be expressed [25],
by combining all the formulas, as

α =

1 +

1
2 (cid:18)

β
β + 1 (cid:19)

.

(10)

In this general context, the property β 6= 0 is called im-
pact inhomogeneity. The conditions listed above are sat-
isﬁed exactly in a random walker model on complex net-
works [25]. Consequently, its behavior is well described
by (10). However, such arguments can also be applied
to stock market trading dynamics when ∆t ≪ 1 min to
ensure the validity of (7). By substituting the observed
values of β, one ﬁnds the estimates α∗
N Y SE = 0.69 ± 0.03
and α∗
N ASDAQ = 0.59 ± 0.02. The actual values are
αN Y SE(∆t → 0) = 0.68 ± 0.02 and αN ASDAQ(∆t →
0) = 0.67 ± 0.02. The agreement for the NYSE data is
good, for NASDAQ it is only approximate. Moreover,
Eq. (8) only ﬁts the data for large enough stocks, while
Eq. (5) gives an excellent ﬁt over the whole range avail-
able. Therefore, this explanation is only partial, however,
it indicates that α > 0.5 is to be expected. This is a cru-
cial point, because markets are so far the only examples
of an 0.5 < α < 1 system.

C. Time scale dependence of α

Section III revealed, that the exponent α of stock mar-
ket activity ﬂuctuations shows a strong dependence on
the time window ∆t. This was previously [7] attributed
to the eﬀect of external factors. On the time scale of min-
utes, news, policy changes, etc. have no time to diﬀuse in
the system. Thus, temporal ﬂuctuations are dominated
by internal dynamics, α < 1. By increasing ∆t to days
or weeks, the importance of this external inﬂuence grows
and α approaches 1, which is characteristic in the pres-
ence of a strong external driving. However, the eﬀect
just described is a crossover, while observations show the
persistence of scaling, only the exponent α changes. This
section oﬀers an alternative description that has no such
shortcoming.

The key is to extend the analysis to H(i) 6= 0.5 sys-
tems. We start from the relations (3) and (5), where the
role of the two variables hfii and ∆t is analogous. When
they hold simultaneously, from the equality of their left
hand sides, one can write the third proportionality

∆tH(i) ∝ hfiiα(∆t) .

After taking the logarithm of both sides, diﬀerentiation
∂2/∂(log ∆t)∂(log hfii) yields the asymptotic equality

γ ∼

dH(i)
d(log hfii)

∼

dα(∆t)
d(log ∆t)

,

(11)

6

where γ is constant. The possibilities are sketched in
Figures 7(a)-(b):

(I) In systems, where γ = 0, the exponent α(∆t) = α∗,
it is independent of window size. At the same time
all nodes must exhibit the same degree of correla-
tions, H(i) = H.

(II) In the case, when γ = γ1 > 0, α(∆t) actually de-
pends on ∆t. This dependence must be logarith-
mic: α(∆t) = α∗ + γ1 log ∆t. At the same time,
the Hurst exponent of the nodes depends on the
mean ﬂux in a similar way: H(i) = H ∗+γ1 log hfii.
Moreover, the slope of the logarithmic dependence
is the same.

(III) When the constant γ is larger, for example γ2 > γ1
in Figures 7(a)-(b), α changes faster with ∆t, while
also H(i) changes faster with hfii.

Finally, the combination of these options is also possi-
ble. Systems may display a crossover between diﬀerent
values of γ at a certain time scale ∆t∗, an example is
given in Figures 7(b)-(c). There, α depends on ∆t in a

exponent of fi(t). Instead, for every node there are two
values, H1(i) and H2(i), that are valid asymptotically,
for ∆t ≪ ∆t∗ and ∆t ≫ ∆t∗, respectively. Then, both
of these must independently follow the logarithmic law:
H1(i) = H ∗

1 + γ1 log hfii and H2(i) = H ∗

2 + γ2 log hfii.

Stock markets belong to this last group. For ∆t ≤ 20
min for NYSE and ∆t ≤ 2 min for NASDAQ, α(∆t) ≈
α∗. Correspondingly, H must be independent of hf i, as it
was found in Section III. On the other hand, for ∆t > 300
min for NYSE and ∆t > 60 min for NASDAQ, α(∆t) is
approximately logarithmic with the common coeﬃcient
γ = 0.06 ± 0.01. This, again, must equal the slope of
H(i) plotted versus log hfii. There is agreement between
error bars with the results of Section III.

The fact that the local derivative dα(∆t)

d(log ∆t) also shows
the degree of logarithmic trend in the Hurst exponents,
gives a visual method to detect the change in this collec-
tive behavior of the market. Those regimes in ∆t, where
α(∆t) is constant, correspond to time scales where all
stocks have the same level (Hurst exponent) of activity
correlations. Where α(∆t) is logarithmically changing,
the slope γ gives the degree of inhomogeneity in H(i).
Finally, the function is curved near crossovers, where
the degree of the mean ﬂux dependence in correlation
strengths is changing.

In order to underline, that the α(∆t) dependence
comes from temporal correlations, we carried out the
same measurement, but with all time series shuﬄed ran-
domly. It is trivial, that if ∆t equals[30] the δ = 1 sec
resolution of the dataset, shuﬄing does not aﬀect the es-
timates of σ(i, ∆t = δ), it merely rearranges the terms
used in averaging. Hence, the ﬁtted slope cannot change
either, αshuf f (δ) = α(δ). On the other hand, shuf-
ﬂing gives uncorrelated time series, Hshuf f (i) ≡ 0.5 (see

systems, where γ = 0, α is independent of window size and H is independent of node. (II) When γ = γ1 > 0, α(∆t) and H(i)

d loghf i = 0.
Hence, according to (11), αshuf f (∆t) = α∗, regardless
of window size. The measurement results – in excel-
lent agreement with the above reasoning – are shown by
empty circles in Fig. 4(a) and (b).

V. CONCLUSIONS

In the above, we outlined a set of stylized facts for
various measures of stock market trading activity. We
generalized a ﬂuctuation scaling relation to the case
when temporal correlations are present in the individual
time series. The framework was then applied to reveal
the connections between these stylized facts. Empirical
data for both of the markets NYSE and NASDAQ show
qualitatively similar behavior. The values of the α(∆t)
time scale dependent scaling exponent can be understood
based on the role of company size. For short times when

there are no correlations between the trades of an indi-
vidual company, the non-trivial value of α comes from
the highly inhomogeneous impact of the diﬀerent com-
panies. For increasing time windows, a logarithmic law
observed in correlation strengths leads to a window size
dependence of α. As the growing impact, i.e., the growing
traded volume with increasing company size can also be
considered as a cumulation of smaller transactions, our
results underline the importance of temporal correlations
and size dependence in explaining scaling phenomena on
the stock market.

[28] Despite earlier arguments [13], σ(i, ∆t) is not divergent

[8, 27] and so H(i) can indeed be introduced.

[29] Note that in general, instead of uncorrelated dynamics,
it is enough if the activity of every node displays the
same Hurst exponent, H(i) = H. This is the direct con-
sequence of arguments in Section IV.

[30] In fact, the DFA procedure can only be applied for ∆t ≥

4δ, but the eﬀect of this diﬀerence is negligible.

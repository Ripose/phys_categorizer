An indicator for presence of community structure in networks is suggested. It allows one to check
whether such structures can exist, in principle, in any particular network, without a need to apply
computationally cost algorithms. In this way we exclude a large class of networks that do not possess
any community structure.

Introduction

Community structure of networks have been inten-
sively studied in recent years, and a number of algorithms
for ﬁnding such structures have been suggested [1, 2]. Be-
ing quite eﬀective, these algorithms allow one to ﬁnd the
community structure in a wide variety of networks. How-
ever, such algorithms are quite complicated and compu-
tationally demanding, moreover not all networks possess
any community structure at all. Therefore it seems desir-
able to have some simple enough indicator allowing one
to judge about potential existence of community struc-
tures in networks prior to exploiting the algorithms for
ﬁnding them. The usage of such an indicator could be
quite eﬀective in negative sense, i.e. the negative answer
to the question whether a particular network can have
any community structure or not would allow one to ex-
clude such a network from consideration, thus avoiding a
use of complicated numerical procedures for community
structure evaluation.

In this paper we propose an indicator of existence of
community structure in networks, which is based on a ge-
ometrically motivated measure that compares an average
network distance with its ”mean diameter”. The indica-
tor is oriented on relatively dense communities, which is
typical for sociological type of networks [3]. We provide
some asymptotic estimations for this indicator which al-
low one to evaluate its numerical values. The indicator is
applied to some model networks with dense communities.
Some real networks are analyzed as well.

Dilatation of a network as an indicator for
community structure

Our goal is to ﬁnd relatively simple indicator for com-
munity structure existence. The idea is to compare the
mean distance, which can be easily calculated, with some
etalon characteristic of networks of a given size N and a
mean degree k. To deﬁne such an etalon let us look at

some geometric analogy. Consider an n-dimensional geo-
metric body of volume V . In geometry the ratio between
the diameter of the body to its minimal possible value
(which is of order of n√V ) is known as a dilatation [4],
which is a measure of body’s asymmetry.

We adopt this concept to networks using the notion of
a mean distance ¯L instead of the diameter. First, notice
that the size N of a network can serve as an analog of
geometric volume, and the ratio δ of the number of links
to the number of nodes N can be chosen as an analog of
dimension. For undirected networks considered here, the
dimension analog is δ = k/2, where k is the mean degree.
For instance, the mean degree of a 2D-torus is k = 4, for
3D-torus k = 6, etc.

We introduce a notion of dilatation of a network and

deﬁne it as

D =

¯L
δ√N

.

(1)

Intuitively, a large value of dilatation can be caused by
strong inhomogeneity, which in turn can be a conse-
quence of the presence of community structure in the
network. However, the presence of community structure
is just one of possible reasons for high network dilatation.
For instance, highly stretched networks, such as a narrow
long strip, can also have high value of dilatation. There-
fore the dilatation can only indicate to possible existence
of a community structure. In other words, big value of
dilatation can serve as a necessary, but not suﬃcient con-
dition for community structure existence.

To illustrate the relationship between community
structure and dilatation consider a simplest possible
conﬁguration having an evident community structure,
namely, a network consisting of two complete graphs of
size N/2 each connected by a single link to each other.
This network contains two communities of maximal den-
sity with a single inter-community link. For large net-

The described extreme examples prompt us to make
a plausible conjecture that, in general, the dilatation of
networks baring no community structure should be rel-
atively small (less than one), whereas the dilatation of
well-structured networks should be at least around 2. Be-
low the last statement will be corrected based on both
analytical estimations and further examples.

Asymptotical estimations

−

To develop analytical estimates we need to describe
more formally community networks. Consider a global
connected network G comprising of N nodes and E links,
so that the dimension of G is δ = E/N . To estimate
the dilatation we need, according to Eq.(1), an estima-
tion for the mean distance ¯LG. To calculate ¯LG suppose
that the network is divided into C communities, so that
i
th community contains mi nodes. Let us also assume
that any two communities are connected by a single link
at maximum.
It should be noted that being obtained
under this assumption, our analytical estimations work
quite well also beyond it, as will be demonstrated below.
Let us deﬁne a macro network M by replacing each of C
communities with a single node and denote the mean dis-
tance in M by ¯LM . The formulas for the dilatation and
the mean distance in general case, derived in Appendix,
assume some apriory knowledge about the structure of
the network. It is possible however to get, under some
additional assumptions, analytical estimations which do
not demand any apriory knowledge about the structure
of the network. Indeed, assuming that all communities
have the same size mi = m
1 and the same mean
distance ¯LC , we obtain the following estimation for the
mean distance ¯LG of the global network

Inequality (5) means that given a particular network
with the mean distance LG, any reasonable partition of
the network into dense communities will result in a macro
network whose mean distance is not bigger than LG −
2.
If, on the other hand, after partitioning the network in-
equality (5) is violated, then the partition was not suit-
able. Notice that equality in (5) takes place when all
communities are complete graphs (1-cliques [3]).

Using Eq.(4) results in the following estimation for di-

This study is focused on Sparse networks with Dense
communities (SD-networks), in which the value of N 1/δ is
close to unity. We propose the following formal deﬁnition
of SD-networks: A network G is an SD-network if δ√N

. To satisfy this condition it is enough that
the dependence of δ = E/N upon N has the form of

It should be noted that the asymptotic estimation
D
2 was obtained under additional restrictions on net-
works, namely: (i) all communities are large enough and
have approximately the same size, (ii) all communities
have the same mean distance, and (iii) there exists not
more then one link between two diﬀerent communities.
However, in real-life networks these restrictions can be vi-
olated, therefore we suggest to use D > 1 as a criterium
for community structure existence. Numerical simula-
tions presented in the next section support the choice of
the criterium D > 1.

In this section we demonstrate, using numerical simu-
lations, how the introduced above indicator of existence
of community structure works on some model networks.
It will be shown that the criterium D > 1 is quite rea-
sonable, even for relatively small communities. Also, it
will be demonstrated that being derived in asymptotical
limit m
1, analytical estimations Eqs.(5) and
(7) are not restricted by this limit, and work quite well
even for relatively small values of m and C.

As a ﬁrst model example consider a ring network with
n = 20 and k = 2, in which each of all 20 nodes is
replaced with a complete graph of size m. Two quan-
tities have been calculated, the dilatation D, and the
mean distance LG as functions of m. The result is shown
in Fig. 1. One can see that the for initial simple ring
with m = 1, that has no any structure, the dilatation is
small. While the community size m increases, the dilata-
tion grows and exceeds 1 at m > 5, when the community
structure becomes clearly pronounced. One can also no-
tice that starting from m

Eqs.(5) and (7) hold well. The same comment holds true

Both the analytical estimations Eqs.(5) and (7) and the

However, applicability of the estimations Eqs.(5) and (7)
is not restricted to this assumption. To demonstrate this,
we have constructed a network with variable community
size, namely 4x3 lattice with community sizes randomly
chosen between 20 and 60, so that the mean community
size equals to 40. Calculation of the mean distance and

the dilatation of this network gives D = 2.98
L = 3.98
0.06. The same network with equal commu-
nity sizes corresponds to the last point in Fig.2 where the
dilatation and the mean distance are D = 2.92782 and
L = 4.01601, correspondingly. Comparing the dilatation
and the mean distance for these two networks one can
conclude that the estimations Eqs.(5) and (7) work well
for networks with not equal communities as well.

Consider again the 4x3 lattice network with equal com-
munities, but now the communities are not complete
graphs, namely each pair of nodes inside the communities
is linked with probability P called community density. So
the number of inside-community links varies. The dilata-
tion and the mean distance as functions of the community
density P is shown in Fig.3.

As it can be seen from Fig.3, the dilatation keeps above
unity even at quite low community density (P > 0.2), in-
dicating to existense of community structure. Moreover,
the estimations Eqs.(5) and (7) work quite well, as long
as the density of communities is not too low. At low
values of P < 0.2 the dilatation is less than 1 indicating
to the absence of dense communities. This is consistent
with the fact that the network dimension becomes low as
well. We note again that both our indicator and analyti-
cal estimations are applicable to SD-networks (relatively
dense communities sparsely connected to each other).

Another assumption made in the course of derivation of
analytical estimations Eqs.(5) and (7) is that each pair of
communities is connected by not more than one link. To
check what happens when we go beyond this assumption,
consider a network comprising of 5 randomly connected
complete graphs, with the number of inter-community
links increased gradually from the minimal value of 4 to
the maximum of about 4000. Figure 4 shows the depen-

dence of the mean distance and of the dilatation upon
the number of inter-community links. As one can see,
the dilatation remains above 1 up to quite large number
of inter-community links (about 2000), afterwards diﬀer-
ent communities become overlapped, so that the border
between communities cannot be deﬁned clearly enough.
At the point when the number of inter-community links
reaches its maximum (4000) and δ = 50, the entire net-
work becomes a complete graph, so that the mean dis-
tance equals to 1 and the dilatation is about 0.91. This
value of dilatation diﬀers from asymptotical one for com-
plete graph due to the fact that the asymptotic δ√N
1
→
is quite slow with respect to δ, therefore 50√N = 1.096.

Random graph

Recently Guimer´a et al.

[5] have pointed out that
Rene-Erdos random graph [6] can exhibit a community
structure due to ﬂuctuations. Their observation was
based on a concept of modularity introduced in Ref.[1].
In this context it seems interesting to analyze such ran-
dom graphs from the point of view of dilatation. To
do this we have constructed a random graph containing
100 nodes connected to each other with probability P ,
and calculated its dilatation. In Fig. 5 both the dilata-
tion and the mean distance are plotted as functions of
P . One can notice a clear maximum at P = 0.4 where
the dilatation, D
2.4. According to our concept this
high value of dilatation indicates to possible existence of
a community structure in the network. This conclusion
is consistent with high modularity of random graphs re-
ported in Ref. [5]. It also seems that this can be related
to another observation about possible hierarchy structure

Real-life networks

To check how our indicator of the existence of com-
munity structures works for real-life networks, we have
calculated the dilatation for 13 undirected networks us-
ing the data presented in the Table II from Ref.
[8].
The highest value of dilatation D = 2.766 was obtained

for the network of ﬁlm actors [9], which indicates that
this network should be well structured. Three other net-
works, train roots [10], Internet [11], and company direc-
tors [12], can also have community structure according
to their dilatation values of 1.78, 1.48, and 1.33, respec-
tively. All other networks presented in the table II from
Ref. [8] have the dilatation less than 1, therefore accord-
ing to criterium D > 1 they hardly can have a community
structure. However, one should be careful using this cri-
terium and keep in mind the assumptions under which it
was obtained. For instance, looking at the data presented
in the above mentioned table we notice that despite the
fact that some networks, like math coauthorship, peer-
to-peer and some other networks, have low dilatation,
they are not dense enough (not SD-networks) to apply
our criterium.

Summary

The notion of dilatation of networks has been intro-
duced. Analytical estimations for the dilatation have
been obtained under some reasonable assumptions. The
value of dilatation is suggested to use as an indicator of
existence of community structure in Sparse networks with
Dense communities (SD-networks). Both some model
and real-life networks have been considered to illustrate
the usage of the indicator suggested, as well as the ap-
plicability of the analytical estimations. Numerical sim-
ulations demonstrate that the analytical estimations can
also be useful beyond the assumptions made during the
derivation.

Mean distance estimates for general SD-networks

Consider a global network G divided into C commu-
nities Qj, j = 1, ..., C with E links between communi-
ties. A macro network M is obtained by replacing each
community Qj with a single node gj. Any community
Qj has mj nodes denoted qi,j, (i = 1, ..., mj) and ej
links. We assume that each community Qj is connected
to other communities via a single node qi0,j which we
call an external node. The following notations will be

Let us discuss some symmetric cases and some types of possible formal symmetries of the communities.
If all communities Qj are weakly symmetric communities, i.e. Lj,0 = Lj for all j, then we can replace Lj,0 by Lj

Additional simpliﬁcation is possible for weakly sym-
metric communities of the same size, i.e. L = Lj = L0,j,
and m = mj for all j

These simple remarks together with estimations for the
mean distance, allow one to obtain necessary estimations
for the dilatation DG. Thus by deﬁnition

Dilatation as an indicator of community structure
existence

Consider again a global network G divided into C com-
munities with E links between them. Corresponding
macro network M is obtained by replacing each commu-
nity Qj with a single node gj. Any community Qj has mj
nodes qi,j and ej edges (links). The following additional
notations will be used δj = mj

The last asymptotic formula demonstrates that for an
SD-network with large number of similar communities
the dependence of dilatation on community type is rep-
resented by its dependence on the network dimension δ,
or more accurately, on [Cm]δ. For example, if commu-
nities Qj are complete graphs of the same size m then
δ = 2

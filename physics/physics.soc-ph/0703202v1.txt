Abstract

A system of identical cars on a single-lane road is treated as a microcanonical and
canonical ensemble. Behaviour of the cars is characterized by the probability of car
velocity as a function of distance and velocity of the car ahead. The calculations a
performed on a discrete 1D lattice with discrete car velocities.

Probability of total velocity of a group of cars as a function of density is calculated
in microcanonical approach. For a canonical ensemble, ﬂuctuations of car density
as a function of total velocity is found. Phase transitions between free and jammed
ﬂow for large deceleration rate of cars and formation of queues of cars with the same
velocity for low deceleration rate are described.

1 Introduction

Traﬃc ﬂow of a system of identical cars on a single-lane road has been inten-
sively studied in recent decade using dynamical or kinetic description of car
behaviour. [1,2] The models used were continuous (ﬂuid dynamical models),
car-following models [3], or discrete particle hopping models related to cellular
automaton models with stochastic behaviour [4]. In this paper we develop an
approach to this problem based not on equations of motion or master equa-
tions describing the system of cars, but in the spirit of statistical mechanics
where:

– Each state of the system is occupied by equal probability and physical prop-
erties of the system are analyzed calculating number of states for some ﬁxed
physical quantities in the microcanonical description. Logarithm of number of
states is called entropy.

– In the canonical approach the probability of states depends on their energy,
and the logarithm of number of all states (weighted by their probabilities, with
negative sign and divided by temperature). is called free energy.

Here we assume that the probability of the car velocity is a function of the
velocity, and the distance of the car ahead, while all the distances between two
cars are equally probable, i.e., from the point of view of statistical mechanics,
a combination of the canonical and microcanonical approach is used. Despite
of that, further it is denoted as a microcanonical one.

The car distances are treated purely microcanonically only in the ﬁrst part
of the paper. In the second one, the density of a group of cars is not ﬁxed,
but it is a part of larger microcanonical ensemble with ﬁxed number of cars.
Here the probability of distances between two cars depends on the length of
the group, and the distances are treated in the same way as velocities, i.e.,
canonically.

In our approach no assumptions about the drivers’ behaviour and car prop-
erties are necessary – the probability of the car velocity can be measured
experimentally, nevertheless, in this paper it is derived from a simple model
behaviour of cars.

In statistical physics the term microcanonical ensemble means, as a rule, an
isolated system, in which some physical quantities are conserved and thus are
constant. In our microcanonical approach the system is not assumed to be
isolated, but only such states of the system, or a subsystem, are taken into
account, for which some quantities remain constant. In a system of cars this
may be, e.g., sum of the velocities of all cars or their density. The subsystem
is inﬂuenced by a boundary condition – the distribution of velocities of the
car ahead of the investigated group.

In the approach of Mahnke et al. [5] the group of cars is represented by a
grandcanonical ensemble, number of cars in which is not ﬁxed, and its chemi-
cal potential is a function of parameters of a master equation. In our approach
the thermodynamics of the system of cars is systematically derived starting
from the microcanonical approach. The properties of a canonical ensemble are
deduced from the known entropy of a subsystem together with a reservoir.
When the size of the cluster of cars inside the reservoir is changed, the deriva-
tive of entropy represents a pressure exerted by reservoir of cars on the group,
instead of chemical potential in the above-mentioned work.

In the last years we could observe a revival of the microcanonical approach
to the problems of statistical mechanics [6–10]. One of the reasons for it was
that the region where the entropy of a ﬁnite system is convex, instead of the
standard concave shape of it, was identiﬁed as a point or line in the phase
space where the ﬁrst-order phase transition in corresponding inﬁnite system

2

takes place. As the number of observed cars in normal traﬃc is not too large,
the techniques developed in statistical physics for small systems are convenient
in this case. The term “phase transition” in this paper is used in the sense of
the above-cited works.

2 Model and method

The cars are further represented by dimensionless points moving on a discrete
one-dimensional lattice, and are characterized by 2 quantities: discrete velocity
vi in the interval h0, vmaxi and a discrete coordinate (site number) xi ∈ h1, Li.
vmax is the maximum velocity given by the construction of the car and L is the
length of the observed group (subsystem) of cars. The coordinate of each car
is measured with respect to the last car of the group. Its coordinate is always
0, i.e., the origin of the coordinate system is ﬁxed to it. As the length of the
group is L, the coordinate of the last car of the group ahead is L. Number
of cars in the group is N. (The lattice constant is related to the car length).
Car velocities and coordinates acquire only integer values. Car velocities are
random, described by a probability distribution peaked around an optimal
velocity vopt, which is further chosen as 90% of maximal safe velocity vm. The
maximal safe velocity is determined from the requirement that two neighbour-
ing cars, which start to decelerate at the same time with the same deceleration
rate a, would stop without crash. Moreover, vm must not be greater than the
maximum possible velocity of the car vmax, i.e., for every car

vopt(v2, x1,2) = 0.9vm(v2, x1,2),

vm(v2, x1,2) =

q2ax1,2 + v2
vmax

2 if vm ≤ vmax

if vm > vmax





(1)

where x1,2 and v2 are the distance (headway) and velocity of the car ahead,
respectively. The reaction time of the driver in (1) is assumed to be equal
to zero, nevertheless, it can be easily generalized for nonzero reaction times
with only a small impact on our ﬁnal results. (This problem is discussed in
more detail in [11]. As we use only integer values of velocities, the nearest
integer value to vopt from (1) is taken for the actual optimal velocity in our
calculations.

The way of driving of the observed drivers is characterized by distribution
of probabilities of car velocities around the optimal velocity. Here we use an
extremely simple distribution, in which the probability of optimal velocity is
p0, the probabilities of the velocities vopt ± 1 are p1, while the probability of
the car to have any other permitted velocity is p2. The sum of all probabilities

3

for each car is equal to 1. The parameters p0, p1 and p2 are the same for every
car, and the distribution depends on the headway only by means of the value
of optimal velocity.

3 Microcanonical description

In the microcanonical approach only such groups of N cars, which length
is L and sum of their velocities is V , are studied. These groups of cars are
inﬂuenced only by the velocity distribution of the car ahead of them with
coordinate L. The probability distribution of each car is given by the rule
above as a function of headway and the velocity of the car ahead, while the
distances between them are arbitrary and limited only by the length of the
group.

The probability that the sum of velocities of N cars in a group of length L is V
multiplied by the number of their conﬁgurations on L sites, is further denoted
as W (V, L) and called density of states. It can be calculated recurrently

W1(V1, L1; v2) = p(V1; L1, v2)

the last line of (2) is the velocity probability of the last car of a large group
ahead of the studied group with the same car density. This large group will
be further called reservoir.

The quantity W (V, L) in (2) expresses the probability that the sum of veloci-
ties of the cars in the group is V as well as the number of possible conﬁgura-
tions of occupation of L sites by N cars. As mentioned above, it is, in fact, a
product of probability P and number of conﬁgurations Ω

As for the ﬁxed length of the subsystem, Ω(L) is constant, only the normalized

In the microcanonical approach only subsystems of cars with the constant
density, the same as is the mean density of the whole system, are studied. To
take into account also the density ﬂuctuations, it is more convenient to use
the canonical description with variable density of the subsystem due to its
variable length.

4 Canonical description

In canonical approach the length of the subsystem varies, only the length
of the whole system, subsystem + reservoir is ﬁxed. The number of cars in
the subsystem and in the reservoir remains constant, so the density of cars
varies with varying length of the groups. Our canonical description diﬀers
from the grandcanonical approach of Mahnke et al. [5] where the density of
the subsystem changes due to exchange of cars between the subsystem and
reservoir.

In statistical mechanics the properties of a reservoir are usually not calculated,
only the values of derivatives of its entropy (logarithm of number of states)
with respect to the quantities, which are ﬁxed in the whole system, are assumed
to be known. They are, e.g., temperature, chemical potential, etc. Similarly, in
our canonical description of the system of cars, a pressure of reservoir exerted
on the subsystem could be introduced. Nevertheless, this quantity cannot be
directly measured, and it would depend on the velocity of the last car of the
reservoir, so we prefer a direct calculation of number of states of a large enough
reservoir for given velocity of the last car and length of the reservoir.

5

The length of the system Ls is the sum of the length of the subsystem and
reservoir X + Lr. The number of cars in the subsystem and reservoir are ﬁxed
and denoted as N and Nr, respectively. If X ≪ Lr and N ≪ Nr, the properties
of the subsystem does not depend on velocity of the ﬁrst car in the reservoir.

Density of states of the reservoir at given velocity of the last car is calculated
according to (3). Density of states of the whole system at given total velocity
of the subsystem V and its length X can be obtained by the same way as in
the microcanonical case, only in the last term in (2) – the probability of the
velocity of the last reservoir car p(vn+1) – is replaced by the density of states
of the reservoir. Last line of (2) now reads

W (V, X) =

Wn(V, X; vn+1)Wr(vn+1, Ls − X).

(6)

X
vn+1

The mean density of the subsystem N/hXi is equal to the density of the whole
system (N + Nr)/Ls.

The main diﬀerence between the microcanonical and canonical treatment is
that in the ﬁrst case only number of states of the subsystem is calculated while
in the latter case the properties of the subsystem are given by the number of
states of the whole system. In the microcanonical approach the reservoir is
used only for calculation of boundary condition – probability distribution of
the last car of the subsystem. It is summed over all car velocities and positions.
In the canonical system the summation is performed only over velocity degrees
of freedom as the velocity even of the whole system is not conserved.

5 Results and discussion

The velocities and positions of cars are described by discrete variables in our
model. Changing the values of its parameters, we can observe two diﬀerent
types of behaviour. In the ﬁrst one, for high deceleration rate a and low densi-
ties, the system behaves like continuous; in the density of states the underlying
discrete structure of velocities is not seen. At small a and high densities, total
velocities of the system, which are integer multiples of number of particles,
are more probable then the others. This regime reminds a ferromagnetic Potts
model where the total magnetization of the system points in many diﬀerent
directions of the space.

In all our calculations, car velocity acquires 21 values vi = i, i = 0, 20. The
probability of a car to move with a velocity vi depends on the velocity and
distance of the car ahead by means of optimal velocity vopt(v, x). It acquires
3 values p(vopt) = p0, p(vopt ± 1) = p1, p(vi) = p2 for all other vi. Only

two of these parameters are independent as the probability is normalized:
20
i=0 p(vi) = 1. In the present calculations p1 is ﬁxed to 0.3, and p2 was chosen
P
for the only free parameter of the velocity distribution. The position of a car
with respect to the ﬁrst one may be an integer between 0, and L − 1 if the site
is not occupied by another car. In the free-ﬂow regime the deceleration rate a
in (1) is put equal to 4.0, in the jammed regime, where the discreteness of the
velocity plays role, a = 0.5.

The main result of our calculations are density of states W (V, X) in the canon-
ical case and probability of the total velocity, P (V, X), of the subsystem as a
function of the subsystem length at ﬁxed number of cars for microcanonical
ensemble. They are plotted in 3D graphs.

In the free-ﬂow regime with a = 4, the shape of density of states W , in
canonical ensemble, depends on the parameter p2. For p = 0, practically all
the cars have their velocity close to the optimal one with the most probable
density at the value of the mean density of the system. For large probabilities
of the small and large velocities, p2 > 0.05, the density of states is represented
by a broad peak with maximum of less than one half of the optimal velocity,
and the cars also in this regime become jammed. In Fig. 1 an intermediate

case is shown with a narrow free-ﬂow peak and a broad peak of jammed cars.
The plot represents distribution of density of states for 5 cars creating a group
of length X with total velocity V . The group is a part of a large system of cars
with ﬁxed total length with density 0.1, i.e., the mean length of the group of
5 cars is 50.

As expected, the velocity of jammed cars is lower that of those moving freely.
Most probable total velocity of the jammed group is about 2/3 of the total
velocity of freely moved group, which density is about 20% smaller. As the
car ﬂow in both groups is diﬀerent, they cannot coexist in a ﬁnite system
in steady state. Both peaks represent two states of the system of cars with
very low transition rate between them, which is expressed by the depth of the
minimum between them. Two neighbouring ﬂuctuation can live long only if
they have the same mean velocity per particle. On the other hand, as the plot
has only one maximum for constant V , the probability of such ﬂuctuations is
low.

In the microcanonical case the length of the subsystem determines the density
of cars not only in the subsystem but also in the whole system together with
reservoir. The length of the group is ﬁxed, and there are no length ﬂuctuation

of it. The probability of total velocity of 5 cars for various density of the whole
system is shown in Fig. 2. The plot is viewed from opposite direction than in
Fig. 1. For length of the group X = 50, it corresponds to the canonical system
of length L = 50 (Fig. 1), which is equal to the mean length of the group.
While in Fig. 1 the plot for small X represents behaviour of dense ﬂuctuations,
in Fig. 2 the whole system together with reservoir is dense. It can be seen that
for X = 5 the most probable state is when all cars have velocity 4.

For high densities the most probable state has a small velocity, for low densities
the most probable velocity is the optimal one. The ﬁrst-order phase transition
occurs when the height of low and high velocity peak is equal; in Fig. 2, it
is at X = 38. It should be stressed that the phase transition introduced in
this paper is not the phase transition exactly in thermodynamic sense as the
system of cars is ﬁnite. In this system cannot coexist large groups of cars
in diﬀerent phases, i.e., with diﬀerent velocities. Then the transition from a
local maximum to absolute maximum of probability is very improbable, and
a strong hysteresis occurs in the system, observed also experimentally [12].

In Fig. 3 and 4 the same plots, but for 2 cars only, are shown. The free-ﬂow
peak is more pronounced in Fig. 3. It can be explained by the fact that also
in a jammed 5-car group, 2 cars may move fast for a short time. The average
length of the group in canonical ensemble is now 20. For two-car groups the
discreteness of model velocities in the density of states and probability of
velocity is manifested. For 5 or more cars, these quantities are smoothed, and
the model can simulate to some extent a real traﬃc.

The discreteness is conspicuous for low braking ability of cars and high den-
sities. For a = 0.5 and N/hXi = 0.2 it can be seen in Fig. 5. In this case,
especially for ﬂuctuation with high densities, the cars have tendency to form
queues with the same velocity of each car.

For low densities (X > 25) and small velocities, these queues are dissolved.
The microcanonical picture of the system is in Fig. 6. Now probability distri-
butions have a number of local maxima. Each of them can become an absolute
maximum for some values of X. Large velocity maxima are absolute maxima
for low densities of cars.

For a system of 2 cars with the same parameters, the density of states and
probabilities are in Figs. 7, 8. Here the queues of cars with equal velocity
consist of 2 cars, and the probability of total velocity has peaks at even values
of V .

For small deceleration rates a, the velocity probability consists of number of
peaks representing phases with diﬀerent total velocities and ﬁrst-order phase
transitions between them. The diﬀerence between these velocities can be taken
as an order parameter in the concrete phase transitions. With increasing a the

becomes zero, and a second-order phase transitions takes place. For large a
(Fig. 1, 2) the distance between the peaks remains always large. Changing the
parameter p2, one of the peaks disappears, but merging of two peaks into one,
i.e. the second-order phase transition, is never observed.

In conclusion, the microcanonical and canonical decription of a system of cars
was developed. The only input into the theory is the probability of car velocity
as a function distance and velocity of the car ahead. According to standard
procedure in statistical mechanics, all other missing information are replaced
by the principle of maximum entropy of the system. From these assumptions
pressure-density diagram of the system can be derived, but here, only directly
observable quantities as density of states and probability of the total velocity
of a group of cars were presented.

Abstract

Complex systems can be characterized by classes of equivalency of their elements deﬁned accord-

ing to system speciﬁc rules. We propose a generalized preferential attachment model to describe

the class size distribution. The model postulates preferential growth of the existing classes and the

steady inﬂux of new classes. We investigate how the distribution depends on the initial conditions

and changes from a pure exponential form for zero inﬂux of new classes to a power law with an

exponential cutoﬀ form when the inﬂux of new classes is substantial. We apply the model to study

the growth dynamics of pharmaceutical industry.

Many diverse systems of physics, economics, and biology [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], share in their

growth dynamics two basic similarities: (i) The system does not have a steady state and

is growing. (ii) Basic units are born and they agglomerate to form classes. Classes grow

in size preferentially depending on the existing size. In the context of economic systems,

units are products, and the classes are ﬁrms. In social systems units are human beings, and

the classes are cities. In biological systems units can be bacteria, and the classes are the

bacterial colonies.

The probability distribution function p(k) of the class size k of the systems mentioned
above share a universal behavior p(k) ∼ k−τ with τ ≈ 2 [1, 3, 4, 6]. Other possible values of

τ are discussed and reported in [7]. Also, for most of the systems p(k) has an exponential

cutoﬀ which is often assumed to be a ﬁnite size eﬀect of the databases analyzed. Several

models [2, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] explain τ ≈ 2 but none explains the exponential cutoﬀ of p(k).
Moreover, these models describing p(k) ∼ k−τ are not suitable to describe simultaneously

systems for which p(k) ∼ exp(−γk). Here we present a model with simple set of rules to

describe p(k) for the entire range of k, i.e., power law with an exponential cutoﬀ. We show

that the exponential cutoﬀ of the power law is not due to ﬁnite size but an eﬀect of the initial

conditions from which the system starts to evolve. We also show that the functional form

of p(k) depends on the initial conditions of our model and changes from a pure exponential

to a pure power law (with τ = 2) via a power law with an exponential cutoﬀ. We justify

our model by empirical analysis of a recently constructed pharmaceutical industry database

(PHID) [14, 15].

We now present a model, which has the following rules:

1. At time t = 0 there exists N classes, each with a single unit.

2. At each simulation step:

• (a) With probability b (0 ≤ b ≤ 1) a class with a single unit is born.

• (b) With probability λ (0 < λ ≤ 1) a randomly selected class grows one unit in

size. The selection of the class that grows is done with probability proportional

to the number of units it already has [“preferential attachment”].

• (c) With probability µ (0 < µ ≤ 1, µ < λ) a randomly selected class shrinks

one unit in size. The selection of the class that shrinks is done with probability

2

proportional to the number of units it already has [“preferential detachment”].

In the continuum limit the proposed growth mechanism gives rise to a master equation of

p(k, ti, t) which is the probability, for a class i born at simulation step ti, to have k units at

step t:.

where g(t) ≡ N +(λ−µ+b)t is the total number of units at simulation step t and p(1, ti, ti) =

1. Equation (1) is the generalization of the master equation of birth and death processes [12].

The analytical solution of Eq. (1) is given by

p(k, t) =

where the functional form of p(k, ti, t) is given in [8]. The lengthy derivation of the full

solution of eq. 1 which is a power law(the second term of eq. 2) with an exponential cutoﬀ

(the ﬁrst term of eq. 2) will be presented elsewhere, here we present simulation results.

First we discuss two limiting solutions of Eq. (1).

• Case i : No new classes are born (b = 0). The growth of the system is solely due to

the preferential attachment of new units to the pre-existing N classes. In this case

(Fig 1a) [12]

p(k) ∼ e

− kN

t(λ−µ) .

This limiting case can be considered as one of the initial condition of the model where

birth or death of classes are not allowed. We observe that this initial condition results

in a pure exponential distribution of the number of units inside classes.

• Case ii : At t = 0, N = 0, and new classes are born with probability b 6= 0. In this

case, for large times p(k) is a pure power law

(1)

(3)

(4)

This limiting case can be considered as another diﬀerent initial condition of the model

where birth or death of classes are allowed starting from N = 0 classes. We observe

p(k) ∼ k−τ ,

τ = 2.

3

that this initial condition results in a pure power law distribution of the number of

units inside classes.

This case is identical to the Simon model [13] and can be understood by the following

arguments. From case (i) we know that when the number of classes remains constant,

p(k) decays exponentially with k. The power law of case (ii) is the eﬀect of superposi-

tion of many exponentials with diﬀerent decay constants, each resulting from classes

born at diﬀerent times (Fig 1a).

We next present a mean ﬁeld interpretation of the result τ ≈ 2. At any moment t0 the

number of units in the already-existing classes is g(t0). Suppose a new class consisting of

one unit is created at time t0. According to rules 2b, 2c, the growth rate is proportional

to 1/g(t0). Neglecting the eﬀect of the inﬂux of new classes on g(t0), the average size k

of this class born at t0 is proportional to 1/g(t0). So the classes which were born at times

t > t0 remain smaller than the classes born earlier. If we sort the classes according to their

size, the rank R(k) of a class is proportional to the time of its creation R(k) ∝ t0. Thus

k ∼ 1/g(t0) ∼ 1/t0 ∼ 1/R(t0) and we arrive to the standard formulation of the Zipf’s law [4]

according to which the size of a class k is inversely proportional to its rank. If we take into

account the decrease of the growth rate with the inﬂux of new classes, one can show after
some algebra k ∼ R−(λ−µ)/(λ−µ+b), which includes k ∼ R−1 as a limiting case for b → 0. Since

R(k) is the number of classes whose size is larger than k, we can write in the continuum

limit R(k) ∼

∞

k p(k)dk and hence p(k) ∼ k−2−b/(λ−µ).
R

The full solution of Eq. (1), a power law with an exponential cutoﬀ, can be interpreted

using the following arguments. We start with N classes which are colored red, and let the

newly born classes be colored blue. Due to the preferential attachment rule, the red classes

remain on average larger than the blue classes. Thus for large k, p(k) is governed by the

exponential distribution of the red classes (Case i) while for small k, p(k) is governed by the

power law distribution of the blue classes (Case ii) (Fig. 1b).

Now we apply this model to describe the statistical properties of growth dynamics of

business ﬁrms in pharmaceutical industry. PHID records quarterly sales ﬁgures of 48 819

pharmaceutical products commercialized in the European Union and North America from

September 1991 to June 2001. The products in PHID can be classiﬁed in ﬁve diﬀerent

hierarchal levels A, B, C, D, and E (Fig. 2) [16]. Each level has a diﬀerent number of

4

classes, and diﬀerent initial conditions (Table I).

We observe that there are positive correlations between the number of units (products)

appearing or disappearing per year and the number of units in the classes at a particular

hierarchal level (Table II). This empirical observation supports preferential birth or death

mechanism (rules 2b, 2c) used in our model.

For levels A and B where the number of classes did not change we obtain an exponential

distribution (Figs. 3a, 3b) as predicted by limiting Case i of the model. For levels C and

D a weak departure from the exponential functional form [Figs. 3c, 3d] is due to the slight

growth in the number of classes.

The full solution predicted by our model, i.e., the initial power law followed by the

exponential decay of p(k) is observed empirically for level E (Fig. 4). For level E we observe

a power law with τ = 1.97 for k < 200, and an exponential cutoﬀ for k > 200. From

the discussion above with red and blue classes we may infer that the exponential part of

p(k) arises from pre-existing ﬁrms, while the power law part of p(k) represents the young

ﬁrms that enter the market. We conclude by noting that our model is in agreement with

empirical observation where we observe p(k) to be pure exponential or a power law with an

exponential cutoﬀ. Our analysis also sheds light on the emergence of the exponent τ ≈ 2

observed in certain biological, social and economic systems.

have no birth or death of classes. System grows with the birth or death of units to pre-existing N

classes (13 for level A and 84 for level B). (ii) For levels C and D system grows not only with the

birth or death of classes but also with birth and death of units inside classes.

FIG. 1: Simulation results of the model. (a) Symbols are data points from simulation, solid lines

are regression ﬁts. We observe for b = 0 (i.e. no class creation ) cumulative probability distribution
is a pure exponential while for N = 0 (i.e. we start with zero initial class ) a pure power law k−(τ −1)

with exponent τ = 2. (b) We observe that as we change the ratio of number of pre-existing classes

to the new born classes p(k, t) changes from a pure power law to a pure exponential.

FIG. 2: In the pharmaceutical industry, products can be classiﬁed according to ﬁve levels. When

a particular product arrives in the market, it is labeled under any one of the 13 classes of the level

remained constant even though the number of products within each class had a dramatic growth.

Over the period of our empirical analysis the number of classes in levels C and D increased by 3%

and 5% respectively. Products can also be grouped into ﬁrms which markets them (classiﬁcation

level E). In the ﬁgure we give the number of classes in each level in 1991.

FIG. 3: Figures (a)∼(d) corresponds to levels (A)∼(D) respectively. Products in the pharmaceuti-

cal industry are classiﬁed into levels A, B, C and D. Levels A and B have ﬁxed numbers of classes,

the number of classes in levels C and D increases by 3% and 5% respectively over the period of

our analysis. For instance, for level A (ﬁg. 3 a) which contains only 13 classes, the distribution is

estimated from 13 random interger numbers which corresponds to classifying 48,819 products in

13 classes. Symbols represent data points in each level (a)∼(d) while solid lines are predictions of

the model. Cumulative probability distributions for all levels are pure exponentials as predicted

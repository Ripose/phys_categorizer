Abstract

Election results are determined by numerous social factors that aﬀect
the formation of opinion of the voters, including the network of interac-
tions between them and the dynamics of opinion inﬂuence. In this work
we study the result of proportional elections using an opinion dynamics
model similar to simple opinion spreading over a complex network. Erd˝os-
R´enyi, Barab´asi-Albert, regular lattices and randomly augmented lattices
are considered as models of the underlying social networks. The model
reproduces the power law behavior of number of candidates with a given
number of votes found in real elections with the correct slope, a cutoﬀ for
larger number of votes and a plateau for small number of votes. It is found
that the small world property of the underlying network is fundamental
for the emergence of the power law regime.

1 Introduction

There has been a growing interest in the study of social phenomena through the
use of tools from statistical physics [1, 2, 3, 4]. This trend has been in part stim-
ulated by developments in complex networks [5, 6, 7, 8], which have uncovered
properties of the structures underlying the interactions between agents in many
natural, technological, and social systems. Social processes can be simulated
through the use of complex networks models over which a dynamical interac-
tion between the agents represented by the nodes is deﬁned, yielding results that
can be compared with the macroscopic results found in real social networks.

Election of representatives are important social processes in democracies,
where a large number of people take part and that represent the result of many
social factors.
It was found [9] that the number of candidates with a given
number of votes in the 1998 Brazilian elections follows a power law with slope
−1 for some orders of magnitude, or a generalized Zipf’s law [10].

Elections depend on the process of opinion formation by the voters. Each
voter chooses one candidate based on its beliefs and through interaction with

1

other voters. Many works have been carried out on opinion formation while con-
sidering several types of dynamics and underlying network topologies. Bernades
et al. [11] and Gonz´alez et al. [12] succeded in reproducing the general −1 slope
of candidates with a given number of votes in Brazilian election results by using
the Sznajd [13] opinion formation model adapted to complex networks.

In the Sznajd model, two neighbors that happen to have the same opinion
may convince their other neighbors. In this article, we adopt a simpler model,
where each single voter tries to convince its neighbors, regardless of their previ-
ous opinion. The obtained results exhibited a substantial agreement with real
election results for some network models.

The article is organized as follows. Firts we describe the network (Sec. 2.1)
and opinion (Sec. 2.2) models used in the simulations. Then, in Sec. 3 we present
and discuss the simulation results and study the eﬀect of the model parameters.
Finally, the conclusions are summarized in Sec. 4.

2 Opinion and Network Models Used

As done in other related works, we assume that the opinion formation for the
voting process occurs as interactions between agents connected through a com-
plex network. The result is thus determined by two factors: (i) the structure of
the network that specify the possible interactions between agents, and (ii) the
dynamics of opinion formation between interacting agents. The following sub-
sections describe the models used in this work.

2.1 Network Models

The voters and their social interactions are represented as a network, so that the
individuals are represented by nodes in the network and every social interaction
between pairs of voters is represented by a link between the two corresponding
nodes. The number of links attached to a node is called the degree of the
node; the social distance between to voters is given by the geodesic distance in
the network, deﬁned as the minimum number of links that must be traversed in
order to reach one of the nodes starting from the other. Two important network
properties [7] are the degree distribution and the average distance between pairs
of nodes.

For the simulation of the opinion formation model we adopted the Erd˝os-
R´enyi and the Barab´asi-Albert [5] models of complex networks. For comparison,
simulations were also performed in two-dimensional lattices and two-dimensional
lattices with random connections added between its nodes. The Erd˝os-R´enyi
networks are characterized by a Poisson degree distribuion and the presence of
the “small world” property: the average distance between nodes grows slowly
with the number of nodes in the network. The Barab´asi-Albert model also
has the small world property, but its degree distribuition follows a power law,
resembling in that sense many social networks. The regular lattice was chosen as

2

an example of a network without the small world property, while the addition of
random connections enables a controled introduction of this property (see [14]).
In the Barab´asi-Albert model, the network starts with m + 1 completely
connected nodes and grows by the successive addition of single nodes with m
connections established with the older nodes, chosen according to the preferen-
tial attachment rule. The growth stops when the desired number of nodes N is
reached.

To generate the Erd˝os-R´enyi network, we start with N isolated nodes and
insert L links connecting pairs of nodes chosen with uniform probability, avoid-
ing self- and duplicate connections; for comparison with the Barab´asi-Albert
model, we choose L so that m = L/N is the same as the m values used for the
Barab´asi-Albert model.

For the two-dimensional lattices, the N nodes are distributed in a square
and the connections are established between neighboring nodes in the lattice.
Afterwards, additional connections can be incorporated between uniformly ran-
dom chosen pairs of nodes until a desired number of average additional links per
node is included. This kind of randomly augmented regular network is similar
to that used in Newman and Watts small-world model [15].

2.2 Opinion Model

For a given network with N voters (nodes), we start by distributing the C
candidates among randomly chosen nodes (with uniform probability), that is,
each candidate is assigned to just one node in the network (this reﬂects the fact
that the candidates are also voters). The remaining voters start as “undecided”,
meaning that they have no favorite candidate yet. The following process is
subsequently repeated a total of SN times: choose at random a voter i that
already has an associated candidate ci; for all neighbors of voter i, if they
have no associated candidate (i.e. are as yet undecided), they are associated
with candidate ci, otherwise they change to candidate ci with a given switching
probability p. The constant S introduced above is henceforth called the number
of steps of the algorithm (average number of interactions of each node). This
opinion model is motivated by the following assumptions: (i) undecided voters
are passive, in the sense that they do not spread their lack of opinion to other
voters; (ii) undecided voters are easily convinced by interaction with someone
that already has a formed opinion; (iii) the ﬂexibility to change opinions due
to an interaction, quantiﬁced by the parameter p, is the same for all voters.
Despite the many limitations which can be identiﬁed in these hypotheses, they
seem to constitute a good ﬁrst approximation an can be easily generalized in
future works.

This model is similar to a simple spreading to unoccupied sites, and can be
reduced to an asynchronous spreading if the switching probability is zero. In
spite of its simplicity, the model yields interesting results, as discussed below.

3 Results

In the following, we present and discuss the histograms expressing the number of
candidates with a given number of nodes. The plots are in logarithmic scale, and
the bin size doubles from one point to the next in order to provide uniformity.
The number of candidates in a bin are normalized by the bin size. All results
correspond to mean values obtained after 30 diﬀerent realizations of the model
with the given parameters.

As becomes clear from an analysis of the following graphs, larger values of
N/C tend to lead to more interesting results, motivating the adoption of large N
and small C. The use of too large values of N implies a high computational and
memory cost; the use of too small values of C leads to poor statistics implied by
the large variations in the number of candidates inside the bins. The standard
values of N = 2 000 000 and C = 1 000 adopted in the following represent a
good compromise considering our computational resources.

Figure 1 shows the results of the simulation for Erd˝os-R´enyi and Barab´asi-
Albert networks after 30 steps and with a switching probability of 0.1. The
result for the Erd˝os-R´enyi network is very similar to results of real elections
[9]. There is a power-law regime for intermediate number of votes, a plateau
for small number of votes and a cutoﬀ for large number of votes; the power-law
regime has an exponent of −1, which is almost the same as that obtained for
real elections [9]. The large variability on the plateau region is also consistent
with the diﬀerences found at this part of the curves when considering diﬀerent
elections outcomes (see for example the data in [10]).

For the Barab´asi-Albert model, although two power-law regimes with diﬀer-
ent exponents can be identiﬁed, neither corresponds to the experimental value
of −1.

The lefthand side of Figure 2 shows the result for the simulation on a two-
dimensional lattice. There is no sign of a power-law regime and a clear peak
around 1 000 votes can be noted, in disagreement with the scale-free nature
of the experimental results. On the righthand side of the same ﬁgure, the
eﬀect of adding random connections to the lattice can be easily visualized. It is
remarkable that the addition of just a small number of new links (about half the
number of nodes) is enough to get a result similar to the one of the Erd˝os-R´enyi
model. It is a known fact [14] that a small number of random links in a regular
network are enough to the emergence of the “small world” phenomenon. By
enabling a candidate to reach the whole network of voters in a small number of
steps, this phenomenon increases the chance of a candidate getting a very large
number of votes, therefore broadening the distribution.

Now we turn our attention to the inﬂuence of the parameters of the model. In
Figure 3 the eﬀect of changing the number of candidates while keeping the other
parameters ﬁxed is shown. For the Erd˝os-R´enyi model, the eﬀect of increasing
the number of candidates translates itself as an upward shift of the curve while,
at the same time, the cutoﬀ is shifted to the left. This is an expected result: as
the number of candidates grows with a ﬁxed number of voters, the candidates
are initially distributed closer to one another in the network, and have therefore

fewer opportunities to spread inﬂuence before hitting a voter already with an
opinion; this leads to a cutoﬀ in smaller number of votes and in an increase in
the number of candidates with less votes than the cutoﬀ. In the Barab´asi-Albert
model, the behavior for small number of votes is similar: the curve is shifted up;
but for the power-law regime of large number of votes, the curve decays more
steeply as more candidates are added.

Changing the number of voters has an impact limited almost exclusively
to the tail of the curves, as seen in Figure 4. When the number of voters is
increased, in the Erd˝os-R´enyi model, the cutoﬀ is shifted to the left and the
power-law regime is correspondingly increased. In the Barab´asi-Albert model,
the maximum number of votes is shifted and the inclination of the second power-
law regime is changed to acomodate this displacement. Comparing with Fig-
ure 3, we see that the tail of the curve for the Barab´asi-Albert model adapts its
inclination according to the relation between number of voters and candidates,
i.e. a larger value of N/C implies a ﬂatter tail.

From Figure 5 we can see that the behavior that is being discussed appears
only if the network is suﬃciently connected: for m = 1 there is no power-law
regime for the Erd˝os-R´enyi model and the behavior for the Barab´asi-Albert
model is complex, with three diﬀerent regions and a peak for small number
of votes. Also for this latter model, the inclination of the tail of the curve
appears to be slightly inﬂuenced by the average connectivity, with steeper tails
for smaller connectivities.

The switching probability has eﬀect only on the ﬁrst part of the curve, as
can be seen from Figure 6. In both models, this part of the curve is shifted down
as the probability increases and its range is extended until it touchs the original

(for zero probability) curve. Note that the inclination of the Barab´asi-Albert
curve corresponding to small number of votes is maintained for the diﬀerent
values of switching probability (but is diﬀerent for zero probability).

A similar eﬀect has been obtained while changing the number of steps (Fig-
ure 7). As the number of steps is increased, the curve remains unchanged for
large number of votes, but is donwshifted for small number of votes. The simi-
larity between an increase in the number of steps and an increase in switching
probability is easyly explained: after all voters have a candidate, changes occur
only by switching candidates. In other words, increasing the number of steps
has as an eﬀect increase in the number of times a switching is tried, resulting
in a similar eﬀect as increasing the switching probability.

4 Conclusions

We suggested and studied a simple voting model based on the spreading of opin-
ions through the links of a network. The results of the simulation of the model
show a remarkable qualitative agreement with experimental results for proporti-
nal voting in Brazilian and Indian elections [9] when the network model used
is of Erd˝os-R´enyi type or a lattice with suﬃcient random shortcuts added. In
these networks, the model results in a power-law distribution with an exponent
of −1, but with a shortcut for large number of votes and a plateau for small
number of votes, as observed in real elections. The “small world” eﬀect appears
to be of central importance in this result, as the result for a lattice without
shortcuts is very diﬀerent, without any power-law regime.

Interestingly, the Barab´asi-Albert network model gives results that are not
consistent with real elections: there are two power-law regimes without a short-
cut and the second (and dominant) power-law regime is not universal, depend-
ing on the number of links per node in the network and the relation between
number of voters and number of candidates. Also, the ﬁrst power-law regime
is not characterized by the experimental value of −1. This is somewhat puz-
zling, as many social networks have power-law degree distribuitions [7] and are
in this respect better related to the Barab´asi-Albert model than to the other
two models investigated. We suspect the explanation to this is related to the
importance of clustering and communities in social networks, neither of which
represented in the Barab´asi-Albert model, although they are not present also in
the Erd˝os-R´enyi networks. This in an issue deserving further investigation.

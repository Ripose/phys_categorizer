A computational technique borrowed from the physical sciences is introduced to obtain
accurate closed-form approximations for the transition probability of arbitrary diﬀusion
processes. Within the path integral framework the same technique allows one to obtain
remarkably good approximations of the pricing kernels of ﬁnancial derivatives. Several
examples are presented, and the application of these results to increase the eﬃciency of
numerical approaches to derivative pricing is discussed.

Keywords: computational Finance; stochastic processes; derivative pricing; path integral
Monte Carlo.

1. Introduction

Continuous-time diﬀusion processes are at the basis of much of the modeling work
performed every day in Finance and Economics. Indeed, since Bachelier’s pioneering
work on the application of probability theory to the dynamics of stock prices [1],
many economic variables subject to unpredictable ﬂuctuations, have been modeled
by stochastic diﬀerential equations of the form

dYt = µy(Yt)dt + σy(Yt)dWt .

(1.1)

0 is the
Here µy(y) is the drift, describing a deterministic trend, and σy(y)
volatility function, describing the level of randomness introduced by the Wiener
process (i.e., white noise), dWt. The main reason for the popularity of this class of
models is probably that in continuous time one can perform analytic calculations
using the instruments of stochastic calculus, and the powerful framework of partial
diﬀerential equations. In particular, for the few cases for which the process (1.1) is
exactly solvable, one can derive closed-form solutions for the associated transition
probability. The latter contains all the statistical properties of the ﬁnancial quantity
modeled by the diﬀusion, and can be exploited in a variety of ways, including

the derivation of no-arbitrage prices for ﬁnancial derivatives in complete markets.
The milestone results derived by Black, Scholes and Merton [2], Cox, Ingersoll and
Ross [3], or Vasicek [4], are among the most signiﬁcant examples of the amount of
progress in Economics that has been done using integrable continuous-time diﬀusion
processes.

Nonetheless, an accurate description of the market observables requires in gen-
eral more sophisticated models than those for which an analytic solution is available.
These are usually tackled by means of numerical schemes ultimately relying on a
discretization of the diﬀusion, obtained by replacing the inﬁnitesimal time dt with
a ﬁnite time step, ∆t. The approximate results obtained in this way become exact
only approaching the limit ∆t
0, and this can be done with some computational
eﬀort.

→

In this paper, we utilize the exponent expansion – a technique introduced in
chemical physics by Makri and Miller [5] – to derive a short-time approximation
of the transition probability of the diﬀusion process (1.1). The aim is to obtain
an analytic approximation which is as accurate as possible for a time step ∆t as
large as possible. On one hand, this allows one to derive approximations of ﬁnancial
quantities that are very accurate even for sizable values of the time step. On the
other, it allows a reduction of the computational burden of numerical schemes as
0 can be achieved with larger time steps, i.e., with less calculations.
the limit ∆t
The possibility to use Makri and Miller’s technique to derive approximations of
the transition probability was originally hinted by Bennati et al. in Ref. [6]. Here
we explore this possibility, giving derivations for a generic diﬀusion process with
state-dependent drift and volatility, and we study the reliability of the exponent
expansion by applying it to several diﬀusion processes of ﬁnancial interest.

→

Through the exponent expansion, the transition probability is obtained as a
power series in ∆t which becomes asymptotically exact if an increasing number of
terms is included, and provides remarkably accurate results even truncating it to
the ﬁrst few (say, n = 3) terms. Two derivations are oﬀered, the ﬁrst by means of
Kolmogorov’s forward equation [7] (Sec. 2), and the second introducing a slightly
diﬀerent formalism (Sec. 2.1). The latter, once the problem is formulated in terms of
Feynman’s path integrals [8], allows the generalization of the exponent expansion to
the calculation of the pricing kernel of ﬁnancial derivatives whose underlying follows
the considered diﬀusion. This allows in turn the derivation of simple approximations
for the price of such contingent claims (Sec. 3). In Sections 2.2 and 3.1.2, we illustrate
the exponent expansion through the application to the Vasicek, the Cox-Ingersoll-
Ross, and the Constant Elasticity of Variance models, and in Section 4 we discuss its
application to Monte Carlo calculations within the path integral framework [9,10,11,
12]. Finally, we draw our conclusions and we discuss further possible developments
in Section 5.

2. Exponent expansion and transition probabilities of diﬀusion

processes

In this Section, we derive the exponent expansion for the transition probability,
y0), giving the likelihood that the random walker following the process
ρy(y, ∆t
|
(1.1) ends up in the position y at time t = ∆t, given that it was in y0 at time
t = 0. Although the derivation can be generalized to the case where drift and
volatility have an explicit time dependence, here for simplicity we will restrict the
discussion to the time homogeneous case. In order to make the derivation easier,
it is convenient to transform the original process in an auxiliary one, say Xt, with
constant volatility σx. Following A¨it-Sahalia [13], this can be achieved in general
through the following integral transformations

Xt = γ(Yt)

σx

≡ ±

Z

Yt

dz
σy(z)

,

(2.1)

where the choice of the sign is just a matter of convenience depending on the speciﬁc
problem considered. The latter relation deﬁnes a one to one mapping between the
x and y processes as the condition σy(z)
0 ensures that the function x = γ(y)
deﬁned by (2.1) is monotonic, and therefore invertible. a A straightforward appli-
cation of Ito’s Lemma [7] allows one to write the diﬀusion process followed by Xt
as

≥

dXt = µx(Xt)dt + σxdWt ,

(2.2)

with

µx(x) = σx

µy(γ−1(x))
σy(γ−1(x)) −
where y = γ−1(x) is the inverse of the transformation (2.1). Finally, the transition
probability for the x and y processes are simply related by the Jacobian associated
with (2.1) giving

The form of the trial transition probability represents the main diﬀerence of
the present approach to the one proposed in Ref. [13], which is otherwise very
similar in spirit. In fact, the latter expands in powers of ∆t the exponential
exp [
W (x, x0, ∆t)] rather then just the exponent, as we do here, instead. As it
will be shown explicitly in the following, the present choice gives rise to a distinct
approximation scheme for n > 0 providing generally a similar level of accuracy
but remarkably simpler mathematical expressions. This is because, by keeping the
exponential form of the ansatz, one formulates a guess which is closer to the exact
one. The latter, can be expected to have an exponential form in order to satisfy
the Chapman-Kolmogorov property of Markov processes [7]. In addition, the expo-
nential choice of the ansatz automatically enforces the positive deﬁniteness of the

transition density which is not granted in the approach of Ref. [13]. In fact, as it
0),
will be shown explicitly in Sec. 2.2, in the limit of very small volatility (σx →
when the eﬀect of the noise disappears and transition density converges to a Dirac’s
δ distribution, the expansion of Ref. [13] breaks down as the transition probability
becomes negative. On the contrary, the exponent expansion remains well deﬁned
and accurate also in this limit. Indeed, the ﬁrst terms of the expansion in ∆t can
be also derived through a small volatility expansion of the transition density, as it
will be discussed in Sec. 3.1.

Similarly to the expansion developed in Ref. [13] the exponent expansion has in
general a ﬁnite convergence radius which is a decreasing function of the volatility.
As it will be shown in the following, for the values of volatilities and ∆t relevant for
ﬁnancial applications the exponent expansion turns out to be very accurate even
when truncated to the ﬁrst few terms.

2.1. Alternative derivation

The term W0(x, x0) in the exponent expansion is somewhat diﬀerent from the higher
order terms. In fact, it is deﬁned by Eq. (2.9) which is decoupled from the recursive
system (2.10). Indeed, it is possible to obtain the same result for the exponent
expansion by expressing the transition density as

ρx(x, ∆t

x0) = e

−W0(x,x0)Φρx (x, ∆t

and looking for an approximate expansion of the form (2.5) for Φρx(x, ∆t
x0). It is

Φρx(x, ∆t

integrals. In this Section, we illustrate this procedure for a few test cases, namely for
the Vasicek [4], the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross [3], and the Constant Elasticity of Variance
[14] diﬀusion processes. We will compare the results of the exponent expansion with
the exact results available in literature, and with the approach of Ref.[13].

is also reported for comparison. The inclusion of each successive order allows one
to increase dramatically the accuracy of the approximation so that the third order
expansion has basically a negligible error even for a sizable time step of order 6
months. Remarkably, for the considered example, the third order expansion allows
one to estimate the 10 years transition probability with a relative error of less than
10 basis points (Fig. 1-(b)). As illustrated in Fig. 1-(a), in the present case the ap-
proach of Ref. [13] provides a slightly poorer level of accuracy for n
2. In addition,
it generally produces more complicated mathematical expressions. Furthermore, as
shown in Fig. 1-(c), in the regime of small volatility the exponent expansion still
provides accurate results while the performance of the approach of Ref. [13] de-
grades. In fact, as anticipated, in the limit of small volatility (σx . 0.5%) the ﬁrst
order correction of the latter approach produces a negative transition probability
signaling a break down of the scheme.

2.2.2. Cox, Ingersoll and Ross diﬀusion

The Vasicek model is probably too easy of a test case as the associated transition
probability is Gaussian. In fact, since the exponent expansion has a leading term
which is Gaussian, the higher powers in ∆t just have to renormalize its average
and variance in order to reproduce the exact result. It is interesting therefore to
test the accuracy of the exponent expansion for a diﬀusion process that, while still
integrable, generates a non-normal transition density. This is the case for the Feller’s
square root process [15]

The accuracy of the exponent expansion in this case is illustrated in Fig. 2. Simi-
larly to the case of the Vasicek diﬀusion, the exponent expansion is characterized by
a remarkably fast convergence by including successive terms of the approximation
so that n = 3 provides already a virtually exact representation of the transition
density, for ∆t
1 yrs. In this case, the approach of Ref. [13] performs slightly
worse of the exponent expansion for n = 1, and slightly better for n = 2. However,
also in this case the former breaks down for small values of the volatility, generating
unphysical transition densities.

3. Pricing kernels for contingent claims

3.1. Path integral formulation

The exponent expansion can be generalized to obtain an approximation of the pric-
ing kernels of ‘standard’ derivatives. This can be done by formulating the pricing
problem within Feynman’s path integral framework [6]. Here we indicate as ‘stan-
dard’ any contingent claim written on the underlying, Yt, whose value at time t = 0,
V0, can be expressed as an expectation value of a functional of a certain type, namely

and P (Y∆t) is a payout function. Above ∆t is the time to expiry, and the expectation
value is performed with respect to the probability measure deﬁned by the diﬀusion
for Yt that we assume of the form (1.1). European Vanilla options, zero coupon
bonds, caplets, and ﬂoorets clearly belong to this family of contingent claims. In
addition, other path-dependent derivatives, like barrier or Asian options can be
expressed in this form (see e.g., Refs. [18,19]).

Similarly to the case of the transition probability, it is in general convenient to
introduce an auxiliary diﬀusion with constant volatility of the form (2.2) by means
of the integral transformations (2.1). Then, the expectation value in (3.1) can be
transformed in an integral over the distribution generated by such auxiliary diﬀusion
by means of the usual Jacobian transformation (2.4). As a result, the value of the
option can be in general written as:

V0(∆t, x0) = E

P (X∆t)F [Xu]
(cid:12)

(cid:12)
where D is the domain of the auxiliary process as deﬁned by the relative stochastic

It is well known form the physical sciences that the path integral Φ(x, ∆t

satisﬁes the partial diﬀerential equation Eq. (2.25) [8]. Note that this is consistent
with the fact that, by deﬁnition, for VF (x)

the transition density of the underlying diﬀusion process for Xt. In particular, as
observed in Sec. 2.1, one can use Eq. (2.25) to derive the exponent expansion for
r0) using the trial form (2.27). As a result, the same expressions Eqs.(2.16-

the reduced Planck’s constant giving the correct energy dimensions). The complete

This correspondence provides an alternative justiﬁcation of the choice of the
exponential ansatz in Eq. (2.5). Indeed, this is the form in which can be expressed
in general the quantum mechanical propagator or the single particle density matrix
[8]. Furthermore, it has been shown for the quantum problem [17] that the exponent
expansion up to third order in ∆t and ﬁrst order in ~/m can be derived starting
from the short time semiclassical propagator obtained [20] through a saddle point
analysis of the limit ~/m
0. Indeed, it can be shown that the second order
correction W2(x, x0), Eq. (2.17), is the so-called van-Vleck determinant of the saddle
point expansion. This explains why the accuracy of the present scheme is preserved
in the corresponding regime of low volatility, as it was anticipated in Sec.2, and
illustrated in Sec.2.2.

3.1.2. An example: Zero Coupon Bond

In this Section we illustrate the prescriptions outlined above by applying the ex-
ponent expansion to the calculation of a zero coupon bond within the Vasicek and
Cox-Ingersoll-Ross models. The zero coupon bond is a ﬁnancial instrument that
provides at time t = ∆t a payout of one unit of a certain notional. Its value at time

remarkably good, and fast converging approximation of the exact pricing kernel for
ﬁnancially sensible parameterizations, and for a sizable value of the time step ∆t.
Finally, the zero coupon bond can be obtained by numerical integration of the
pricing kernel according to Eq. (3.3). The corresponding results are shown in Fig. 4
conﬁrming once more the quality of the approximation. In a similar fashion, one
can obtain systematic approximations for caplets, ﬂoorets, and other simple interest
rate derivatives whose value depends only on the value of the instantaneous short
rate at time t = ∆t. It is also possible to generalize this approach to path dependent
contingent claims, like Asian options.

4. Extending the time-step: path integral Monte Carlo methods

For an extended time interval T , the calculation of the transition density or, more in
general, of the pricing kernel (3.4) can be performed by discretizing the path integral
(3.5), and taking the limit of large number of time slices (P
) according to the
standard Trotter product formula:

In general, to obtain an accurate result for the pricing kernel for an extended time
period T one has to increase the number of time slices, or Trotter number P , until
convergence is achieved. By replacing the Trotter formula with the improved short-
time kernel obtained through the exponent expansion (2.5) one achieves a faster
convergence with the Trotter number, thus signiﬁcantly reducing the computational
burden. In this case the ﬁnite-time expression of the pricing kernel reads

Equation (4.3) allows one to obtain the transition density or the pricing kernel
for a standard derivative through the calculation of a multidimensional integral over
the variables x1, . . . , xP −1. The latter integration is ideally suited for Monte Carlo
methods either in real, or in Fourier space [21], the speciﬁc choice depending on
the particular problem at hand. In addition, importance-sampling schemes, e.g., by
means of the Metropolis algorithm [22], can be easily applied in order to reduce the
computation time. However, in order not to introduce a systematic bias in the result
a particular attention has to be paid in order to sample accurately the conﬁguration
space.

The most straightforward way to perform a Monte Carlo quadrature of Eq. (4.3),

is to realize that a simple Markov chain x = (x1, . . . , xP −1)

the relative error with respect to the exact result is reported. Lines are quadratic ﬁts.

The convergence with the Trotter number P of the path integral Monte Carlo
estimates is illustrated in Fig. 5 for the calculation of the ﬁrst ﬁve moments of the
T = 40 yrs transition probability of the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross model (2.38). The ﬁnite
P estimates converge very rapidly with 1/P . In particular, for the case considered,
P = 20 already provides estimates in agreement with the exact result within statis-
tical uncertainties. In general, as also shown in the ﬁgure, a convenient indicator of
the convergence is the zeroth-moment or normalization of the distribution. The cal-
culation of this quantity allows in general to assess the level of convergence without
performing a complete scaling with P , thus saving computational time.

5. Conclusions

The exponent expansion is an approximation of the quantum mechanical propagator
known in physical chemistry [5,17]. We have generalized this approach to produce
closed-form approximation of the transition probability of arbitrary non linear pro-
cesses, and we have shown that it produces very accurate results for integrable

rationale [13], the exponent expansion always generates positive deﬁnite transition
probabilities, and remains stable also in the limit of low volatility.

By introducing a path integral framework we have generalized the exponent
expansion to the calculation of pricing kernels of ﬁnancial derivatives, and we have
shown how to obtain accurate approximations for the price of simple contingent
claims. We have also shown how the exponent expansion can be naturally used to
increase the eﬃciency of path integral Monte Carlo simulations. The latter allow
one to extend the calculations to arbitrarily large time steps, and to eﬃciently
calculate the Greeks of contingent claims, avoiding any numerical diﬀerentiation. A
systematic study of the eﬃciency of this approach for the pricing of exotic derivatives
will be the object of future investigations.

The exponent expansion can be generalized to multifactor diﬀusion processes,
and to time dependent drift and volatility functions. This would allow one to in-
crease the eﬃciency of numerical simulations of a larger family of diﬀusion processes
relevant for Financial applications, including local volatility or Libor Market Mod-
els. Work is currently in progress along this line of research.

Acknowledgments It is a pleasure to thank Gabriele Cipriani for sparking
my interest in the path integral approach to option pricing, and for continuous
stimulating discussions. Very useful comments from the anonymous referee are also
gratefully acknowledged.

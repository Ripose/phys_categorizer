Abstract

A detailed empirical analysis of the productivity of non ﬁnancial ﬁrms across several countries

and years shows that productivity follows a non-Gaussian distribution with power law tails. We

demonstrate that these empirical ﬁndings can be interpreted as consequence of a mechanism of

exchanges in a social network where ﬁrms improve their productivity by direct innovation or/and

by imitation of other ﬁrm’s technological and organizational solutions. The type of network-

connectivity determines how fast and how eﬃciently information can diﬀuse and how quickly

innovation will permeate or behaviors will be imitated. From a model for innovation ﬂow through

a complex network we obtain that the expectation values of the productivity level are proportional

to the connectivity of the network of links between ﬁrms. The comparison with the empirical

distributions reveals that such a network must be of a scale-free type with a power-law degree

distribution in the large connectivity range.

INTRODUCTION

Recently, the availability of huge sets of longitudinal ﬁrm-level data has generated a

soars of productivity studies in the economic literature [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. There are several

measures of productivity [8], in this work we consider two basic measures:

labour and

capital productivity. The Labour productivity is deﬁned as value added over the amount

of employees (where value added, deﬁned according to standard balance sheet reporting,

is the diﬀerence between total revenue and cost of input excluding the cost of labour).

Although elementary, this measure has the advantage of being accurately approximated

given the available data. The other alternative measure is the capital productivity which

is deﬁned as the ratio between value added and ﬁxed assets (i.e. capital). This second

measure has some weakness since the ﬁrms’ assets change continuously in time (consider

for instance the value associated with the stock price). Usually the literature recognizes

that the productivity distribution is not normally distributed [7], and empirically ‘fat tails’

with power law behaviors are observed. But the mainstream proposed explanations cannot

retrieve this power law tails yielding -at best- to log-normal distributions [9, 10]. According

to the evolutionary perspective [11, 12], ﬁrms improve their productivity implementing new

technological and organizational solutions and, by this way, upgrading their routines. The

search for more eﬃcient technologies is carried out in two ways: (1) by innovation (direct

search of more eﬃcient routines); (2) by imitation of the most innovative ﬁrms [13, 14]. In

practice, one can ﬁgure out that once new ideas or innovative solutions are conceived by

a given ﬁrm then they will percolate outside the ﬁrm that originally generated them by

imitation from other ﬁrms. In this way the innovation ﬂows through the ﬁrms. Therefore,

the network of contacts between ﬁrms which allows such a propagation must play a decisive

role in the process.

In this paper we introduce a model for the production and ﬂow of innovation in a complex

network linking the ﬁrms. We show that the resulting productivity distribution is shaped by

the connectivity distribution of this network and in particular we demonstrate that power

law tails emerge when the contact-network is of a scale-free type. These theoretical ﬁnding

are corroborated by a large empirical investigation based on the data set Amadeus, which

records data of over 6 million European ﬁrms from 1990 to 2002 [15]. A statistical analysis of

such a data reveals that: (i) the productivity is power law distributed in the tail region; (ii)

2

this result is robust to diﬀerent measures of productivity (added value-capital and capital-

labor ratios); and (iii) it is persistent over time and countries [15]. A comparison with the

theoretical prediction reveals that the empirical data are well interpreted by assuming that

the contact network is of scale-free type with power law tailed degree distributions.

The paper is organized as follows: Section II recalls the concept of social network; Section

III introduces the model supporting the technological distribution while Section IV describes

the empirical ﬁndings. A conclusive section summarizes the main results.

II. CONTACT NETWORKS IN SOCIAL SYSTEMS

Systems constituted of many elements can be naturally associated with networks link-

ing interacting constituents. Examples in natural and artiﬁcial systems are:

food webs,

ecosystems, protein domains, Internet, power grids. In social systems, networks also emerge

from the linkage of people or group of people with some pattern of contacts or interactions.

Examples are: friendships between individuals, business relationships between companies,

citations of scientiﬁc papers, intermarriages between families, sexual contacts. The relevance

of the underlying connection-network arises when the collective dynamics of these systems

is considered. Recently, the discovery that, above a certain degree of complexity, natural,

artiﬁcial and social systems are typically characterized by networks with power-law distri-

butions in the number of links per node (degree distribution), has attracted a great deal of

scientiﬁc interest [16, 17, 18]. Such networks are commonly referred as scale-free networks
and have degree distribution: pk ∼ k−α (with pk the probability that a vertex in the network

chosen uniformly at random has degree k). In scale-free networks most nodes have only a

small number of links, but a signiﬁcant number of nodes have a large number of links, and

all frequencies of links in between these extremes are represented. The earliest published

example of a scale-free network is probably the study of Price [19] for the network of ci-

tations between scientiﬁc papers. Price found that the exponent α has value 2.5 (later he

reported a more accurate ﬁgure of α = 3.04). More recently, power law degree distributions

have been observed in several networks, including other citation networks, the World Wide

Web, the Internet, metabolic networks, telephone calls and the networks of human sexual

contacts [17, 18, 20, 21, 22]. All theses systems have values of the exponents α in a range

between 0.66 and 4, with most occurrences between 2 and 3 [23, 24, 25, 26].

When analyzing the industrial dynamics, it is quite natural to consider the ﬁrms as

interacting within a network of contacts and communications.

In particular, when the

productivity is concerned, such a network is the structure through which ﬁrms can imitate

each-other. Our approach mimics such a dynamics by considering simple type of interactions

but assuming that they take place through a complex network of contacts.

III.

INNOVATION FLOW

The innovation originally introduced in a given ﬁrm ‘i’ at a certain time t can spread

by imitation across the network of contacts between ﬁrms. In this way, interactions force

agents to progressively adapt to an ever changing environment.

In this section we introduce a model for the ﬂow of innovation through the system of ﬁrms.

We start from the following equation describing the evolution in time of the productivity xl

of a given ﬁrm ‘l’:

xl(t + 1) = xl(t) + Al(t) +

Qj→l(t)[xj(t) − xj(t − 1)]

(1)

Xj∈Il

−

t−1

Xτ =l

q(τ )
l

(t)[xl(t − τ ) − xl(t − τ − 1)].

The term Al(t) is a stochastic additive quantity which accounts the progresses in productivity

due to innovation. The terms Qj→l are instead exchange factors which model the imitation

between ﬁrms. These terms take into account the improvement of the productivity of the ﬁrm

’l’ in consequence of the imitation of the processes and innovations that had improved the

productivity of the ﬁrm ’j’ at a previous time. Such coeﬃcients are in general smaller than

one because the ﬁrms tend to protect their innovation content and therefore the imitation is

-in general- incomplete. In the following we will consider only the static cases where these
quantity are independent on t. The term q(τ )

is:

(3)

This term excludes back-propagation: ﬁrm ‘l’ imitates only improvements of the productivity

of ﬁrm ‘j’ which have not been originated by imitation of improvements occurred at the ﬁrm

4

‘l’ itself at some previous time. The system described by Equation 1 can be viewed as a

system of self-avoiding random walkers with sources and traps.

The probability Pt+1(y, l)dy that the ﬁrm l at the time t + 1 has a productivity between y

and y + dy is related to the probabilities to have a set {Qj→l} of interaction coeﬃcients and

a set of additive coeﬃcients {Al(t)} such that a given distribution of productivity {xj(t)} at

the time t yields, through Equation 1, to the quantity y for the agent l at time t + 1. This

is:

with ˆΛt(ϕ, l) being the Fourier transform of Λt(a, l). From this equation we can construct

a relation for the propagation of the cumulants of the productivity distribution. Indeed, by

It has been established by Maddison that the average innovation rate of change in the

OECD countries since 1870 has been roughly constant [27]. In our formalism this implies

hAl(t + 1)i − hAl(t)i
hAl(t)i

∼ const.

Therefore, the mean of the additive term in Equation 1 (hAl(t)i) must grow exponentially
with time and consequently the ﬁrst cumulant (the average indeed) reads: c(1) = c(1)
1 )t.
Equivalently we assume an exponential growth also for the other moments (c(ν) = c(1)
1 )t).
Equation 8 can now be solved by using a mean-ﬁeld, self-consistent solution (neglecting

Equation 10 (and its simpliﬁed form (Equation 15)) describes a mean productivity which
grows at the same rate of the mean innovation growth (as a power of c(1)

1 ) and is directly

proportional to the number of connections that the ﬁrm has in the exchange network. From

Equation 10 we also have that all the cumulants increase with a corresponding power rate
((c(ν)

1 )t). But, if we analyze the normalized cumulants: λ(ν)(t) = k(ν)

immediately see that at large t they all tend to zero excepted for the mean and the variance.

Therefore the probability distributions tend to Gaussians at large times.

Summarizing, in this section we have shown that, at large t, the expectation value of

the productivity level of a given ﬁrm is proportional to its connectivity in the network

of interaction and the ﬂuctuations around this expectation-value are normally distributed.

Each ﬁrm has a diﬀerent connectivity and therefore the probability distribution for the

productivity of the ensemble of ﬁrms is given by a normalized sum of Gaussians with averages

distributed according with the network connectivity. As discussed in the previous section,

power-law-tailed degree distributions are very common in many social and artiﬁcial networks.

It is therefore natural to hypotheses that also the social/information network through which

ﬁrms can exchange and imitate productivity has a degree distribution characterized by

a power law in the large connection-numbers region.

If this is the case, then the whole

productivity distribution will show a power-law tail characterized by the same exponent of

the degree distribution [28].

the productivity distribution for France and Italy only, but similar results have been obtained

for other Euroland countries of the AMADEUS dataset. The frequency distributions show

a very clear non-Gaussian character: they are skewed with asymmetric tails and the labour

productivity (Figures 1 and 2 (Left)) present a clear leptokurtic pick around the mode. The

complementary cumulative distributions (P>(x), being the probability to ﬁnd a ﬁrm with

productivity larger than x) show a linear trend at large x implying a non-Gaussian character

with the probability for large productivities well mimicked by a power-law behavior.

such power law tails in the productivity distribution: they are a consequence of the so-

cial/information network which is of “scale-free” type (analogously with several other com-

plex systems where such a connectivity-distribution can be measured [29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34]).

Indeed, we have shown that distribution for the productivity of the ensemble of ﬁrms is given

by a normalized sum of Gaussians with averages distributed according with the network con-

nectivity. As consequence, when the connection network is of scale-free type the productivity

distribution must share with it the same exponent in the power-law-tail.

Comparisons between the theoretical predictions from Equation 15 associated with a

scale-free network and the empirical ﬁndings are shown in the Figures 1, 2, 3 and 4 (Right).

In particular, accordingly with Equation 15, we assume an average productivity given by
k(1)
l = m+zln, a variance equal to σ and the degree distribution of the network given by pk ∝
k−α exp(−β/k). The agreement with the empirical ﬁndings is quantitatively rather good.

We note that, although there are several parameters, the behavior for large productivity is

controlled only by the power-law exponent −α. On the other hand, in the small and the

middle range of the distribution the other parameters have a larger inﬂuence.

From our analysis we observe that the theoretical curves ﬁt well the empirical ﬁndings

by assuming the power law exponent equal to α = 2.7 and 2.1 for the labour productivity in

Italy and France respectively. These exponents are in good agreement with the ones typical

of the degree distribution in social networks. On the other hand the capital productivity

presents much steeper decays which can be ﬁtted with exponents 3.8 and 4.6 respectively.

m = 0.06, n = 0.02, σ = 0.4 and β = 68.

These very high values of the exponents might be consequence of the irrational euphoria

of the late 90es when the stock markets were hit by a speculative bubble (1997) and its

subsequent crash (2000). The bubble increased the value of the ﬁrms’ asset thus lowering

the value added-capital (i.e. capital productivity) ratio and soaring the power law coeﬃcient

of the power law distribution of the capital productivity distribution. However the very high

capital productivity regions show a slowing down which could be ﬁtted with lower exponents.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have shown that the productivity of non-ﬁnancial ﬁrms is power law

distributed. This result is robust to diﬀerent measures of productivity, diﬀerent industrial

sectors, years and countries. We have also argued that the empirical evidence corroborates

the prescription of the evolutionary approach to technical change and demonstrated that

power law distributions in productivity can be interpreted as consequence of a simple mecha-

nism of exchanges within a social network. In particular, we have shown that the expectation

values of the productivity level are proportional to the connectivity of the network of links

between ﬁrms. The comparison with the empirical data indicates that such a network is of

a scale-free type with a power-law degree distribution. In the present formulation we have

assumed an underlying network which is ﬁxed in time. This allows obtaining equilibrium

solutions. On the other hand, a more realistic analysis should consider a non-static underly-

10

ing network and therefore non-equilibrium trajectories modulated by the ﬂuctuation in the

underlying network. This non-equilibrium dynamics can be studied numerically from Equa-

tion 1 by using ﬂuctuating exchange coeﬃcients Qj→l(t) . This is left to future research. In

this paper we had a narrower goal: to show that empirical evidence is very well ﬁtted by

the evolutionary view of technical change.

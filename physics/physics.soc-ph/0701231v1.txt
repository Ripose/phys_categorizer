Abstract. - I propose to sharpen the index h, proposed by Hirsch as a useful index to characterize
the scientiﬁc output of a researcher, by excluding the self-citations. Performing a self-experiment
and also analyzing two anonymous data sets, it is shown that self-citations can signiﬁcantly reduce
the h index in contrast to Hirsch’s expectations.

Introduction. – About one year ago the physicist
Hirsch [1] proposed an easily computable index h as
importance, signiﬁcance,
an estimate of the visibility,
and broad impact of a scientist’s cumulative research
contribution. This index h is deﬁned as the highest
number of papers of a scientist that received h or more
citations. Of course, for many people ”it is distasteful
to reduce a lifetime’s work to a number” [2]. For others
h is an ”elegantly simple” measure [3], which allows
an easy comparison of the scientiﬁc achievement of a
scientist in an unbiased way by a single number. As it
can be determined easily by ordering the publication list
according to the number of citations which is for example
possible using the Science Citation Index provided by
Thomson ISI in the Web of Science (WoS) data base, it
has received immediate attention in the public [4] and the
physics community [5–7] and is already widely recognized
as a useful measure in evaluations. Already a signiﬁcant
amount of literature in informetrics [8–13] has been deal-
ing with this measure of visibility of a scientist. Diﬀerent
data sets have been evaluated to identify the most highly
cited scientists in various ﬁelds [1, 3, 7, 14]. A comparative
study on committee peer review [15] of post-doctoral
researchers in biomedicine suggested that the Hirsch
index is indeed a promising (rough) measurement of the
quality. The statistical correlation of the Hirsch index
with standard bibliometric indicators and peer judgement
was shown to be quite high for 147 chemistry research
groups in the Netherlands [16]. A critical analysis of the
Hirsch index of 187 evolutionary biologists and ecologists
from the editorial boards of seven journals illustrates the
risk of indiscriminate use of the index [2]. A quantitative
investigation of the statistical reliability [6] has cast
doubts on the accuracy and precision of the Hirsch index.
Nevertheless the interest in this measure continues to
grow [7–12, 16–21].
It was shown [10] that the Hirsch index notion can
be extended to the general framework of information
production processes and that any system has a unique

Hirsch index. Banks [21] has extended it to an index
for scientiﬁc topics and compounds in order to identify
hot topics and interesting materials. The Hirsch-Banks
index is deﬁned in analogy to h as the highest numbers
of papers in a particular ﬁeld or on a speciﬁc compound
that received h or more citations. This extension has
also received a lot of attention even beyond the scientiﬁc
community, identifying nanotubes, nanowires and quan-
tum dots as the most interesting topics in recent years.
Other generalizations concern the comparison of entire
research groups by their Hirsch index [16] and the utility
for assessing the impact of journals [12, 22].
When identifying hot topics, it is obvious that one will be
dealing with a set of publications which are heavily cited
within the ﬁeld which means that they are probably most
often cited by people working on the same topic, i.e. by
the same set of people who have written these publica-
tions. However, when assessing the scientiﬁc achievement
of an individual scientist, the analogous kind of citations
within the data set, namely the self-citations should
ideally not be included, because they are not reﬂecting
the impact of a publication. Of course, self-citations
increase the h index, but Hirsch has argued that the eﬀect
is relatively small and that the necessary corrections for h
would involve only very few if any papers. An analysis of
a group of scientists in ecology and evolution [2], however,
showed an average decrease of 12.3%.
In contrast, the
Hirsch indices of 31 inﬂuential scientists in information
science dropped only between zero and three, on average
by 0.9, or 6.6%, when self-citations were excluded [3]. In
the present investigation I demonstrate that the inﬂuence
of self-citations on the Hirsch index can be drastic, in
particular for younger scientists with a low Hirsch index.
Three diﬀerent ways to sharpen the Hirsch index will be
proposed.

Data base. – But it is a rather time-consuming
task to identify all self-citations. Because of self-interest

and of the fact that it is relatively easy to check ones
own publications and citations I ﬁrst performed a self-
experiment and investigated several ways to determine
the self-citations by myself and by my co-authors. Ex-
cluding them, my Hirsch index dropped by 18%. Then
I also analyzed the publications of a somewhat older
colleague who is working in a more topical ﬁeld in a
In contrast, I also investigated the
mainstream area.
records of a somewhat younger colleague, working in
a less attractive ﬁeld, who has published fewer papers.
Their Hirsch indices also dropped signiﬁcantly by 13%
and 46%, respectively.
Before analyzing the self-citations, one has to make
sure that the data base is correct. This concerns the
usual diﬃculties, that diﬀerent persons with the same
name and same initials are found. The often suggested
solution to check the aﬃliation is rather complicated
when researchers are concerned who have changed
between various places. Moreover, my own university
is an example, why the correlation with the aﬃliation
is often misleading, because we not only changed our
name between faculty, department and institute; but also
between Hochschule, Technical University, and University
of Technology; and further from Karl-Marx-Stadt via
Chemnitz-Zwickau to Chemnitz. Another problem in
establishing the data base is the possible diﬀerent way
of spelling names, which is particulary evident for the
transliteration of e.g. Russian authors, or names which
have changed e.g. by marriage.
In principle, for the
identiﬁcation of the self-citations the same diﬃculties
occur. However, it is quite unlikely that a manuscript
is cited by a diﬀerent scientist with the same name, so
that this problem does not occur in practice. On the
other hand, diﬀerent ways of spelling an author’s name
or entirely diﬀerent names of the same author can easily
mask self-citations so that care should be taken in these
cases. Of course, missing citations because of misspelled
names cannot be avoided, because they do not show
up at all in the search. The data sets used below have
been carefully checked with respect to the mentioned
diﬃculties. In my own case the WoS search yielded 754
results out of which only 268 were my own publications.
The full list would give me a ﬂattering, but wrong h = 46
instead of h1 = 27. The names of both colleagues whose
publications are analyzed below are not so common,
so that in their cases the analysis was relatively easy,
because nearly all papers which were found in the ISI
data base for their names were really published by these
colleagues. For the second set with 282 papers I analyzed
only the 131 publications with 10 or more citations and
found just two which did not appear in this author’s
publication lists. For the third set I conﬁrmed that 87 of
the listed 91 papers should be attributed to the colleague.
In both cases there was no inﬂuence on the Hirsch index.

ber of citations by one of the co-authors including myself (light
grey/yellow).

Self-citations. – Before coming to the analysis of
these data sets, let me comment on the question, why
self-citations may appear. One reason is, that they are
really needed in the manuscript in order to avoid repeti-
tion of previously described experimental setups, theoret-
ical models, as well as results and conclusions which may
be necessary for the discussion in a certain manuscript
but need not be repeated in this manuscript. Such self-
citations are of course completely legitimate. A second
reason for self-citations is that probably everybody knows
his own previous manuscripts best and therefore it is eas-
ier to refer to these own papers when a citation is re-
quired in a given context for a certain argument. This
practice is already questionable, at least when the num-
ber of such self-citations is relatively high. The third rea-
son for self-citations is certainly disreputable: Due to the
ever-increasing number of evaluations which are based on
citation counts, it is of course tempting to enhance one’s
citation count by referring to the own papers for this very
purpose. The Hirsch index is vulnerable to such practice,
because it is a single number which can be relatively eas-
ily enhanced by speciﬁcally citing those papers for which
the citation count is close to but below the critical value
h. For example, in my own case (see ﬁg. 1) just one ci-
tation of my 28th paper would be suﬃcient to increase
the Hirsch index. However, this paper happens to be ﬁrst
manuscript that I have ever co-authored so that its ”lim-
ited period of popularity” [23] has long ended, it is also
not a ”sleeping beauty” [23] and therefore it is unlikely
to be cited by somebody else. Therefore I would have to
cite it myself, if I want this paper to have an eﬀect on
my Hirsch index.
In future, when the Hirsch index has
become – as I expect – more popular, such manipulations
might become more severe. In any case, even the perfectly
legitimate self-citations mentioned above should not be in-
cluded in any measure of scientiﬁc achievement, therefore
the self-citations should be excluded.

SCCs of the ﬁrst kind. – The problem is now how
to identify self-citations. In the WoS search one can ob-
tain the names of up to 100 citing authors for a given
paper and how often these people cited the respective pa-
per. Thus it is easy to identify how often somebody has
cited his own paper. I call this the self-citation corrections
(SCCs) of the ﬁrst kind. The respective data are shown
in ﬁgs. 1, 2, and 3 for the example data sets mentioned
above. In my own case, see ﬁg. 1, eight papers dropped
below the critical value of h1 = 27, ﬁve of them even
below the value h1
o = 24. Fortunately two manuscripts
with the full citation count between 24 and 27 remained
in that range even after the SCCs had been taken into ac-
count. Consequently, my Hirsch index was reduced only
to h1
o = h1 − 5 + 2 = 24, not to h1 − 8 = 19. Of course,
due to the strongly ﬂuctuating number of self-citations,
the publications have to be reordered by the number of ci-
tations after the SCCs have been taken into account. The
respective result is shown in ﬁg. 4, conﬁrming h1
o = 24.
For the data set in ﬁg. 2, the SCCs are often drastic, like
53 self-citations for the ﬁfth paper, but usually leaving still
a signiﬁcant number of other citations. Consequently the
SCCs do not inﬂuence the Hirsch index very strongly, they
lead to a reduction from h2 = 38 to h2
o = 34, as shown in
ﬁg. 5. In the third case, however, the SCCs in ﬁg. 3 are so
signiﬁcant, that the citation counts of all manuscripts fall
below the value h3 = 13. However, 7 of these manuscripts
have a corrected count of 7 or more citations, leading to
the new h3
o = 7. Out of the 12 manuscripts, which origi-
nally had between 7 and 12 citations, two remain in this
range but cannot enhance the h3
o value, as shown in ﬁg. 6.

SCCs of the second kind. – Of course, if a paper
is cited by one of the co-authors, such a citation should
also not be taken into account. Using again the above-
mentioned ISI list of citing authors for a particular publi-
cation, it is relatively easy to ﬁnd the co-author with the
highest number of citations for this particular publication.
I call the reduction of the citation count by this number

the SCCs of the second kind. For long author lists, on
ﬁrst sight the analysis appears to be not so straightfor-
ward, because the WoS summaries show at most 3 au-
thors. However, the ”Format for Print Page” displays
all co-authors. In my own case, the number of citations
for several manuscripts dropped signiﬁcantly more by the
SCCs of the second kind than by those of the ﬁrst kind, as
can also been deduced from ﬁg. 1, in particular for order
numbers 4, 11, 21, 27 – 29, 36 – 38, 50. Again a reordering
of the manuscripts had to be performed, the result is in-
cluded in ﬁg. 4. The corresponding index h1
c, which is cor-
rected for the (co-)author with the most self-citations, can
be determined from ﬁg. 4 as h1
c = 23. That means, that
the SCCs of the second kind did further reduce my Hirsch
index, but only slightly although the citation counts of sev-
eral papers dropped. For the two colleagues, the respective
data are also included in ﬁgs. 2, 5 and 3, 6, respectively.
In the ﬁrst case, sometimes a co-author was an even more
enthusiastic self-citer, see e.g. for the sixth paper in ﬁg. 2,
with 60 self-citations. Nevertheless, as this occurred again
mostly for papers with a large citation count, the eﬀect on
the Hirsch index is small, it is reduced to h2
c = 33. In the
second case rarely a co-author was more enthusiastically
citing the own manuscripts than the investigated author
himself, therefore in this case the Hirsch index remains at
the value h3

c = h3

o = 7.

Analyzing the author list for the citations of a particular
publication, it is straightforward to identify all co-authors
as long as they appear among the set of 100 citing authors
to which ISI displays are limited. Of course, the eﬀort is
signiﬁcantly higher than for the SCCs of the second kind,
because now one has to look for all co-author names in
often long lists of citing authors; usually one has to check
the complete lists, because some co-authors, e.g. typically
PhD students never appear. Therefore I have performed
this analysis completely only for my own publications and
for the relatively small data set in ﬁg. 3. Summing the self-
citations of all co-authors of course overshoots the aim,
because the counted self-citations are not just additive as

without my own self-citations, reordered (white), without max-
imal number of any co-author self-citations, reordered (black),
and without cumulative co-author self-citations, not reordered
(medium grey/blue). Note that the latter histograms conceal
the previous ones, so that in particular the columns of second
and third kind often do not show up, because they are not dif-
ferent from the third and/or fourth kind. The reordering is not
restricted to the 54 papers in ﬁg. 1 but comprises the full data
set.

two authors of a paper may have written another paper
together, citing the ﬁrst one, which would be counted as
a self-citation for both co-authors. This overestimate can
be so severe that it can lead to negative values for the
citation count of papers which are heavily cited by several
co-authors. Nevertheless I have analyzed the data in ﬁgs. 1
and 3 after subtracting the sum of all self-citations for
each paper, resulting in a lower limit for the corrected
Hirsch index of h1
l = 5, respectively. For the
second data set, the same analysis was performed only
for the publications with 30 or more citations and yielded
h2
l = 29. (Note that this result conﬁrms that it is suﬃcient
to analyze the publications with more than 29 citations.)

l = 20 and h3

SCCs of the third kind. – The correct way of
taking multiple co-author self-citations into account is
obviously to check every citing paper for co-authorship.
This yields the SCCs of the third kind. That requires an
enormous amount of tedious work, which can be done
relatively easy for one’s own publications although it is
still quite time consuming and error prone. Fortunately
one can do this in the ISI citing author list by checking
(ticking oﬀ) all co-author names and viewing the data,
which gives a list and thus the number of cumulative
self-citations of all co-authors. The results are included in
ﬁgs. 4 – 6, and the analysis yields a reduction of the Hirsch
index to the sharpened Hirsch index h1
s = 33,
and h3
s = 7, respectively. It can be seen that the eﬀect
on the number of citations for many publications is zero
compared to the SCCs of the second kind. Accordingly
the reduction of the Hirsch index from hc to hs is small
or zero. Therefore it is a rather safe assumption, that it

s = 22, h2

Fig. 5: Same as ﬁg. 4, for data set 2.

In retrospect,

c and about 1.2 h2

is usually suﬃcient to perform this analysis only for those
papers which are ranked in the vicinity of the index hc
deﬁned above taking the SCCs of the second kind into
account.
For the data set of ﬁg. 2 which is based on a large number
of publications with a large number of citations and,
most important for the amount of correlations, usually
many co-authors, an analysis of the SCCs of the third
kind for only the 22 publications with a citation count
between 28 and 56, i.e., between 85% and 170% of h2
c
appeared to be appropriate a priori.
it
would have been more than suﬃcient to determine the
cumulative self-citations for the 10 papers with a citation
count between h2
c , ﬁnding that although
3 out of these publications dropped below the value of
c = 33, the remaining were just suﬃcient to keep h2
h2
s at
h2
In fact, in this particular case, even an analysis of
c.
the 4 papers with a citation count of exactly h2
c would
have been enough. On the other hand, starting from the
full citation counts (i.e. not taking ﬁrst the SCCs of the
second kind into account) one would have had to analyze
at least the citations of 26 papers falling originally into
the range between 0.85 h2 and 1.6 h2, in order to reach
the correct h2
For my own case an analysis of the 15 publications
between 0.85 h1
s = 22,
but a restriction to the 6 papers in the range between h1
c
and 1.2 h1
c already misses one (the 17th in ﬁg. 4) out of
the 3 whose citation counts drop below h1
c. Starting from
the full citation counts, the range of 0.85 h1 to 1.7 h1
comprising 21 papers would have been just suﬃcient to
determine h1
For the third case, the range 0.85 h3
c covers
13 publications including the ones most cited (after
excluding the SCCs of the second kind). Therefore it is
not surprising that this range is more than suﬃcient to
determine h3
s. In fact, also in this case an analysis of the 4
papers at h3
c would have been enough to corroborate the
value h3
s = 7, although 2 of these drop below h3
s. On the
other hand, starting from the original citation counts (i.e.

c yields the correct h1

without considering SCCs), even the range of 0.85 h3 to
1.7 h3 would have been insuﬃcient for a correct analysis,
one would have to start as low as 0.6 h3 and include
also the most cited papers to obtain the correct value of h3

In table 1 the discussed values are compiled, and I have
also added the results for a fourth data set reﬂecting the
achievements of a prominent scientist in La Jolla. The
relative reduction from h to the sharpened Hirsch index
hs is considerable.
Interestingly, the absolute decrease
is nearly the same in all cases, although very diﬀerent
publication and citation patterns distinguish the cases. It
is therefore only a conjecture, when I infer that such an
absolute reduction might by typical.

Conclusion and outlook. – In conclusion, Hirsch’s
conjecture that usually only very few if any papers need
to be dropped from the h count,
if self-citations were
taken into account, has been shown to be unrealistic. It
may well be true for the prominent physicists that he has
mentioned in his paper [1]. Roediger [24] has also argued
about the self-citations that for ”people with very high
counts, they aren’t much of a problem.” However, for the
average scientist, this is not valid. I even believe it to be a
good guess that for younger scientists with comparatively
low Hirsch index, the inﬂuence of the SCCs is often

p-5

relatively strong. But it is at this stage of the career
where the Hirsch index is or will be probably most often
used for the assessment of the scientiﬁc achievements of
a scientist, be it for a promotion or for the comparison
with competitors for an open position. Consequently,
the Hirsch index should be used with reasonable care,
and it would be good policy to take the SCCs into
account. As mentioned above, it is straightforward and
easy to determine the SCCs of the ﬁrst kind and it is
also relatively easy to calculate the corrections of the
second kind. Taking the third kind, i.e., the cumulative
self-citations into account is of course the method of
choice, but it is rather diﬃcult to execute, unless an
automatic correlation between author lists and citing
author lists can be performed.
Other corrections may also be reasonable in particular
It
when comparing people working in diﬀerent areas.
has already been observed by Hirsch [1] that citation
patterns in diﬀerent ﬁelds vary signiﬁcantly. This was
quantiﬁed [25]
in terms of a scaling factor. Another
correction with the (average) number of co-authors has
been proposed [1, 7, 24, 26] and a large impact especially
in physics was found [7, 26]. As the Hirsch index usually
increases with the number of publications, it has been
suggested to compare it with the average h for scientists
in the same ﬁeld and the same number of publications
in order to detect those researchers who ”clearly deviate
from world standards” [25]. One should also be aware
that the general search in the WoS data base does not
take into account books, book chapters, or conference
proceedings. For some ﬁelds these are less relevant, while
in other ﬁelds they might be decisive for the impact of a
scientist’s research. Of course, it would also be interesting
to investigate, how an individual’s Hirsch index increases
with time [1, 17]
As already mentioned, when one wants to identify hot
ﬁelds of research the citations within a certain community
interest and should be measured, so that the
are of
self-citations might even have some value and need not
necessarily be excluded. On the other hand, it is well
known that there exists schools, sometimes also called
maﬁa or citation cartels, whose members try to increase
their visibility by citing mostly friends and family.
It
would be an interesting exercise to exclude citations
within such a school from the determination of the Hirsch
index. This can in principle be done by compiling a
list of all co-authors with whom a certain scientist has
published any paper and to exclude from the citation list
of every manuscript every citation by anybody from this
list. When this cumulative co-author list increases with
time because new co-authors appear on the list, then the
self-citation-corrected count of older manuscripts can be
decreased and thus the index can also decrease with time,
which is not possible due the SCCs discussed above, nor
it is possible for the original proposal of Hirsch.
In any case, I believe that at least the own citations, i.e.
the self-citations of the ﬁrst kind, which can be most

Michael Schreiber

easily determined, should be excluded from any evalua-
tion, because they can be most easily manipulated by the
author. The temptation to increase one’s Hirsch index
oneself should be avoided, even though some journals
explicitly suggest to their authors to cite themselves
or other papers of the journal in order to increase the
impact factor. This is of course understandable from
their business point of view, but it is questionable from
the scientiﬁc point of view.

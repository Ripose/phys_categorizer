Abstract

We study the eﬀect of inﬂexible agents on two state opinion dy-
namics. The model operates via repeated local updates of random
grouping of agents. While ﬂoater agents do eventually ﬂip their opin-
ion to follow the local majority, inﬂexible agents keep their opinion
always unchanged. It is a quenched individual opinion. In the bare
model (no inﬂexibles), a separator at 50% drives the dynamics to-
wards either one of two pure attractors, each associated with a full
polarization along one of the opinions. The initial majority wins. The
existence of inﬂexibles for only one of the two opinions is found to
shift the separator at a lower value than 50% in favor of that side.
Moreover it creates an incompressible minority around the inﬂexibles,
one of the pure attractors becoming a mixed phase attractor. In ad-
dition above a threshold of 17% inﬂexibles make their side sure of
winning whatever the initial conditions are. The inﬂexible minority
wins. An equal presence of inﬂexibles on both sides restores the bal-
anced dynamics with again a separator at 50% and now two mixed
phase attractors on each side. Nevertheless, beyond 25% the dynamics

is reversed with a unique attractor at a ﬁfty-ﬁfty stable equilibrium.
But a very small advantage in inﬂexibles results in a decisive lowering
of the separator at the advantage of the corresponding opinion. A few
percent advantage does guarantee to become majority with one single
attractor. The model is solved exhaustedly for groups of size 3.

Opinion dynamics has become a very active subject of research [1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] in sociophysics [11, 10]. Most works consider two state models
which lead to the disappearance of one of the two opinions. They use local
updates in odd size groups which result in the initial majority victory. A
unifying frame was shown to include most of these models [12]. Continuous
extensions [13, 14] and three state models [15] have been also investigated.

However, including an inertia eﬀect in even size local updates groups, the
initial minority may win the competition spreading over the entire popula-
tion. The inertia eﬀect means that in an update even size group at a tie, the
opinion which preserves the Status Quo is selected locally by all the group
members [16, 17]. When an opinion represents a vote intention, the model
allows to make successful prediction in real voting cases like for the 2005
french referendum [18].

At contrast it is found that including contrarian behavior leads to the re-
versal of the dynamics with a stable equilibrium at exactly ﬁfty-ﬁfty whatever
the initial conditions are. A contrarian is an agent who makes up its opinion
by choosing the one minority opinion, either the local minority within its
update group [19] or the global minority according to polls [20]. It was used
to explain and predict the occurrence of a recent series of hung elections in
democratic countries [19].

In addition to contrarian behavior [19, 20, 21, 22], another type of be-
havior is also quite current while dealing with real opinion dynamics, it is
the inﬂexible attitude. At contrast to ﬂoater agents who do eventually ﬂip
their opinion to follow the local majority, inﬂexible agents keep their opinion
always unchanged. The inﬂexible attitude is a quenched individual state.
Surprisingly, it has not been studied so far. It is the subject of this article
to investigate the inﬂexible eﬀect on the associate opinion dynamics. To
confront our results to any real situation requires to have an estimate of the
various densities of inﬂexibles, which could be extracted in principle from

In the bare model, where no inﬂexible is present, denoting A and B the

it drives the
dynamics towards either one of two pure attractors, pB = 0 where the A
opinion has totally disappeared, and pA = 1 where the A opinion has totally
invaded the whole population. It is shown in Fig. (1). The initial majority
always wins.

The existence of inﬂexibles for only one of the two opinions, for instance
opinion A, is found to shift the separator at a lower value than 50% in
favor of that side. Moreover it creates an incompressible minority around
the inﬂexibles, one of the pure attractors, here pB, becoming a mixed phase
attractor, where opinion B holds the majority but with a stable A minority,
pB = 0
= 0. See the upper part of Fig. (2). In addition, increasing
the one side inﬂexible density above some threshold (17% for update group
of size 3) inﬂexibles make the separator and the mixed phase attractor to
coalesce and thus cancel each other to both disappear. Their side becomes
certain of winning whatever the initial conditions are. The inﬂexible minority
wins as illustrated in the lower part of Fig. (2).

But again, a very small advantage in inﬂexibles results in a decisive lower-
ing of the separator at the advantage of the corresponding opinion as shown
in the upper part of Fig. (4). In addition the lower part of Fig. (4) shows
that a few percent advantage does grant the victory.

Moreover, the associated opinion never disappears but at minimum stabilizes
at some stable minority value pB,a. The associated opinion can now invade
the whole population even when it starts at an initial value lower than 50%
within some appropriate range. The lower part shows that beyond 17% in
the density of inﬂexibles, the separator and the mixed phase attractor have
vansihed after they have coalesced. At any initial condition, the A wins and

separator at the advantage of the corresponding larger side. The lower part
shows the case of a few percent advantage, which does grant the victory.

We now solve analytically the problem for local update groups of size 3.
Initial proportions at time t of both opinion are respectively pt and (1
pt)
where each agent does have an opinion. On the A side, at any time the
associated agents holder are divided among a ﬁxed and constant proportion of
inﬂexibles a, they always keep on opinion A, and a varying density of ﬂoaters
a. The ﬂoaters do shift opinion depending on their local update group

Then at time t people are grouped randomly by three and a local majority
rule is applied separately within each local group. At time t + 1 within each
group all ﬂoaters who held the minority opinion do shift to the local majority
one. However inﬂexibles do not shift their opinion. Dealing with three agents,
the only subtle cases are the ones where 2 agents sharing the same opinion

minority agent joins the majority, otherwise being an inﬂexible, it does shift

to write at time t + 1 for the new proportion of opinion A,

After one update, all agents are reshuﬄed before undergoing a second
redistribution among new random groups of three agents each. Now pt+1
plays the role of pt before, and a new density pt+2 is obtained. The process
is repeated some number n of times leading to the density pt+n of agents

and independent of the value of n.

While the reshuﬄing frame has been viewed as belonging to a mean ﬁeld
treatment [5, 6, 7], it has demonstrated to indeed create a new universality
class [23].

Before proceeding we review the bare model, i.e., no inﬂexible is present
(a = b = 0) and all agents are ﬂoaters. From Eq. (2) one cycle of local
opinion updates via three persons grouping leads to the new distribution of
vote intention as,

For instance starting at pt = 0.45 leads successively after 5 updates to
the series pt+1 = 0.43, pt+2 = 0.39, pt+3 = 0.34, pt+4 = 0.26, pt+5 = 0.17
with a continuous decline in A support. Adding 3 more cycles would result
in zero A support with pt+6 = 0.08, pt+7 = 0.02 and pt+8 = 0.00. Given
any initial distribution of opinions, the random local opinion update leads
toward a total polarization of the collective opinion. Individual and collective

6

opinions stabilize simultaneously along the same and unique vote intention
either A or B.

The update cycle number to reach either one of the two stable attractors
can be evaluated from Eq. (2). It depends on the distance of the initial den-
sities from the unstable point attractor. However, every update cycle takes
some time length, which may correspond in real terms to some number of
days. Therefore, in practical terms the required time to eventually complete
the polarization process is much larger than any public debate duration, thus
preventing it to occur. Accordingly, associate elections never take place at
the stable attractors. From the above example at pt = 0.45, two cycles yield
a result of 39% in favor of A and 61% in favor of B. One additional update
cycle makes 34% in favor of A and 66% in favor of B.

We can now insert the existence of inﬂexibles. To grasp fully its social
meaning we will introduce it in several steps. For the ﬁrst one, inﬂexibles
are present only on one side, say A. We thus have b = 0 which yields a = x.
Eq. (2) becomes

Solving the associated ﬁxed point Equation pt+1 = pt yields the three

and pA = 1 to be compared to the bare results (x = 0) pB = 0, pc = 1
2 and
pA = 1. While pB, and pc have been shifted toward one another, pA stayed
unchanged as in the upper part of Fig. (2).

From above expressions an increase in x gets closer the attractor pB,a
and the separator pc before they coalesce at xc = 3
0.17, and
there disappear as seen in Fig. (5). The attractor pA stays independent of x.
Therefore for x > 0.17 the unique ﬁxed point of the dynamics is the attractor
pA = 1. Any initial support in A leads to its victory.

Fig.

winning inﬂexible minority is slowed down in some window of support before
it starts to increase at a speedy path.

For instance pt = 0.20 leads successively to the series pt+1 = 0.23, pt+2 =
0.25, pt+3 = 0.27, pt+4 = 0.29, pt+5 = 0.30, pt+6 = 0.32, pt+7 = 0.33, pt+8 =

0.96, pt+21 = 1.00, with a continuous increase in A support. However 15 up-
dates are necessary for A to reach the majority from its initial 20%. Before,
at x = 0, 8 updates were reducing a 45% support to zero while now 15 are
required to gain 30%.

In terms of real time durations, a number of 15 updates may imply many
months. Fig. (7) shows two initial supports pt = 0.20 and pt = 0.52 for
respectively x = 0 and x = 0.20. The diﬀerences in the associated dynamics
are drastic.

We note that setting x =

b deﬁnes the symmetric situation with inﬂex-
ibles only on side B. We then have a = 0 and b for the respective densities
of inﬂexibles. Above results then apply to the B opinion with the variable b
playing the role of x.

towards leading the opinion competition. Accordingly both opinions are

of the combined eﬀect of simultaneous contrarians and inﬂexibles is under
investigation [24]. Nevertheless, it is shown below that this similarity holds
only for the case of equal densities of inﬂexibles for each opinion.

It is certainly realistic to consider inﬂexibles on both sides, but the sym-
metric hypothesis is peculiar. To account for the numerous situations, which
exhibit diﬀerent densities of inﬂexibles, we now study the eﬀect of a discrep-
ancy in a and b.

is the number of real roots. Their respective formulations being rather anes-

real solutions of which at least two are equal, and for D > 0 there are one
single real root and two imaginary roots.

of a separator and two attractors as shown in the left part of Fig.

shifts the separator below 50% as in the case of one sided inﬂexible.
For instance b = 0.15 and x = 0.02 yield pB,a = 0.22, pc = 0.47
and pA,b = 0.82. A 2% diﬀerence in inﬂexible produces a substantial
unbalance of the democratic frame of the public debate since the A
opinion needs to start with an initial support larger than 47% to be
sure to win an associated election provided the campaign duration is
long enough.

For instance, an initial pt = 0.48 leads to the series pt+1 = 0.481, pt+2 =
0.483, pt+3 = 0.485, pt+4 = 0.487, pt+5 = 0.490, pt+6 = 0.493, pt+7 =
0.497 and pt+8 = 0.502. Eight updates are necessary to cross the
to gain 2.2%. To reach a higher
winning bar of ﬁfty percent, i.e.
score requires more updates with the follow up of pt+9 = 0.507, pt+10 =
0.513, pt+11 = 0.521, pt+12 = 0.529, pt+13 = 0.539, pt+14 = 0.551, pt+15 =
0.566, pt+16 = 0.582, pt+17 = 0.601. Nine additional updates makes the
support in favor of A to exceed sixty percent. The majority reversal is
here much slower than in the precedent cases.

It is worth to emphasize that the initial value pt = 0.46 < pc leads to
the victory of the B opinion since it starts below the separator located
0.02 with the
at pc = 0.47. By symmetry, a negative value x =

initial value pt = 0.52 yields the advantage to opinion B which wins
the majority with the same above dynamics.

(ii) Furthermore, given b and increasing x > 0 results in a continuous shrink-
ing of the distance between the separator pc and the mixed phase at-
tractor pB,a. At some threshold value xc both ﬁxed points coalesce.
We are then in the second case with two real solutions whose one is
double (D = 0). At reverse, for x < 0 it is pc and pA,b which coalesce
at x =

xc. Above choice b = 0.15 yields xc = 0.055.

−

(iii) Afterwards for x > xc the two ﬁxed points which have coalesced disap-
pear leaving pA,b as the single attractor of the dynamics. To disappear
means they became imaginary, we are in the third case D > 0 with one
single real solution pA,b.
For x > xc, in the vicinity of xc the ﬂow is very low as seen in the
middle part of Fig. (10) where we have the set (b = 0.15, x = 0.10).
The dynamics in the third case with only one unique ﬁxed point, an
attractor and above initial value pt = 0.48 yields now the series pt+1 =
0.503, pt+2 = 0.528, pt+3 = 0.556, pt+4 = 0.587, pt+5 = 0.620.

One single update is now suﬃcient to rise the minority opinion A to
the status of majority as compared to eight updates above. Only four
additional updates reach the sixty percent bar instead of the previous
nine. The majority reversal has been accelerated.

Going to the set (b = 0.15, x = 0.15) makes the dynamics faster as
exhibited in the right part of Fig. (10). We now have from pt = 0.48
the series pt+1 = 0.517, pt+2 = 0.555, pt+3 = 0.595, pt+4 = 0.637, pt+5 =
0.679.

which have the surplus of inﬂexibles to invade the majority of the pop-
ulation (A for xc and B when
xc ). The above three diﬀerent series

for b = 0.15 and x = 0.02, 0.10, 0.15 are reproduced in Fig. (11).

It thus appear to be of a central importance to determine the value of
xc given the value of b. Once the associated opinion reached a surplus of
inﬂexibles xc it eventually wins the election with certainty. To achieve this
goal, we need to solve the Equation D = 0 as a function of the variable x, b
being a ﬁxed parameter, where D is given by Eq. (11).

of repeated updates whose number is put on the abscisse. Three diﬀerent
series are shown for respectively x = 0.02, 0.10, 0.15 with b = 0.15. The two
extreme cases x = 0.02 and x = 0.15 yields a similar dynamics. However in
the ﬁrst case an initial pt = 0.46 would lead the the B victory at contrast

ion without any shift. At low and equal densities, they prevent the trend
towards a total polarization of ﬂoaters along one unique opinion. The opin-
ion dynamics is found to lead to a mixed phase attractor with a clear cut
majority-minority splitting. Below 25% of equal density inﬂexibles for both
opinions, the initial majority opinion wins the public debate. At contrast,
beyond 25% the dynamics is reversed and converge towards a ﬁfty-ﬁfty at-
tractor. Therefore an equal density of inﬂexibles produces eﬀects which can
also be achieved by suﬃciently low densities of contrarians [19].

However, even a very small asymmetry in the respective inﬂexibles densi-
ties upsets the balanced character of above results. At a very low diﬀerence,
the main eﬀect is to shift the separator from ﬁfty percent to a lower value
at the advantage of the larger inﬂexible opinion. It also increases its incom-
pressible minority support. Moreover, an excess in inﬂexibles beyond some

small threshold xc, which depends on b, grants the victory to the beneﬁciary
opinion. In this regime there exists only one single attractor, which drives
the corresponding opinion to an overwhelming majority. Nevertheless it is
worth to emphasize that the associated dynamics may become rather slow.

for a given opinion to win the public debate competition. It appears that the

separator from 50%. A larger diﬀerence in inﬂexibles, whose amplitude varies
as a function of the other opinion support, guarantees the winning of the
campaign, and eventually the follow up election.

On this basis we plan to extend our study to larger size update groups.
We also plan to combine both eﬀects of contrarians and inﬂexibles to study
the dynamics of ﬂoaters [24].

Abstract

The steady-state and nonequilibrium properties of the model of environmental-
economic interactions are studied. The interacting heterogeneous agents are simu-
lated on the platform of the emission dynamics of cellular automaton. The model
possess the discontinuous transition between the safe and catastrophic ecology.
Right at the critical line, the broad-scale power-law distributions of emission rates
have been identiﬁed. Their relationship to Zipf’s law and models of self-organized
criticality is discussed.

Key words: agent-based distributed feedback, discontinuous transition,
environmental-economic interactions

1 Introduction

On the onset of global ecological crisis questions related to regulation technolo-
gies and safe handling of environmental resources become urgent. The equilib-
rium between the economic growth and environmental variables is an actual
problem of every government. The environmental science must deal with the
task how to design robust sensorial nets and control systems to manage the
balance between the immediate economic needs and the long-time perspectives
of mankind. There are several instruments for control and decrease the local
and global pollution rate: energy taxation, pollution rights and introduction
of cleaner technologies. Unfortunately, direct and naive application of these
approaches does not result relevant emission reductions. Enforcing pollution
rights is diﬃcult and has high administrative costs [1,2]. As an example can
serve the multi-country control model of international coordination of emis-
sion charges and pollution trading [3]. As shown in Ref. [3] pollution trading

may result a non-cooperative equilibrium with high pollution rates. It is often
argued that if the only tool of policy is the energy taxation it may cause the
loss of the competitiveness between ﬁrms. Moreover, the tax rate which is be
able to stabilize the emissions would be too high to be economically and po-
litically acceptable. Because of energy taxation and network eﬀects in society,
the ﬁrms tend to delay adoption to cleaner technologies [4,5]. All these unex-
pected emergent regulatory eﬀects stimulated our interest about the problem
of dynamics of emissions that can be seen as a consequence of the competitive
interaction of the environmental and economical (acquisition) agents.

A key principle we applied to deﬁne a robust environmental policy is the
feedback mechanism. In general, the nonlinear feedback is one of the key up-
bottom mechanism that enables to keep control over the dynamics of complex
systems. The mechanism has been exploited in many diﬀerent systems. The
problem discussed in Ref.[6] is focused to the feedback localization of the para-
metric boundary between periodicity and chaos generated by a logistic map.
Stabilization of dynamical regimes via feedback appears in the simulations of
investments Ref.[7]. In Ref.[8,9] model has been suggested, where the specula-
tive market expectations are linked via the positive feedback to the prevailing
price trend. As stated in Ref.[10], the steady self-organized critical (SOC)
regime Ref.[11] implies the operation of inherent feedback mechanism that
ensures a steady state marginally stable against disturbances. It is important
here to note that criticality is accompanied by the absence of characteristic
scale of the power-law distributions of avalanches. According Ref.[12] the non-
linear feedback allows to transform the models of the ”unstable” phase transi-
tions (i.e. classic models) to SOC models. In the works devoted to self-adjusted
Monte Carlo methods Ref.[13,14], the feedback which drives the physical sys-
tem to a critical regime is expressed in terms of estimated statistical averages.
Additionally, catastrophic environmental collapses in consumption/pollution
feedback models were described in [15,16]. In this paper we present feedback
control distributed over the population of autonomous sensing mobile agents
that control the behavior of factory agents.

As usual, the thinking about distributed control is motivated by the expected
robustness against accidental failures. Nevertheless, most of agent systems
face to the general problem of agency that is the imperfect incentives [17] to
satisfy the global goal function of system. Our motivation is to show, that this
property of distributed agent system may drive the environment to a critical
state with extremal emission ratio. The idea of walking sensorial agents in our
model is very similar to the idea of distributed pollution sensing by pigeon
bloggers proposed by de Costa Ref.[18], where pigeon agents are equipped by
communication chips and sensors for carbon monoxide. Similar idea had been
reported as a concept of randomly walking sensors for detection of dynamically
changing gradient sources [19].

2

The plan of the paper is as it follows. In the next section the multi-agent
ecological model is introduced. In section sec.3 the results of numerical study
are discussed. Finally the conclusions are presented.

2 The model

The ﬁrst point we consider is the dynamics of diﬀusive emissions of factory
agents. The base substance of model is a square lattice with dimension L
L
which represents the physical space for emission spreading. The factories are
located on random lattice sites and the spatial distribution of their emissions is
directed by discrete rule of diﬀusion. For this purpose, we implement a cellular
automaton (CA) based on integer rules. Our suggestion for computation of
diﬀusion is partially inspired by the lattice gas models of pollutants Ref.[20].
However, we preferred formulation where the concentration ﬁeld on lattice
sites varies via the recursive rule

that replaces in one time step t the m(t, R) ”integer pieces” of emission at the
position R
[Rx, Ry]. The emission inﬂow caused by the factory agents IF is
discussed in below Eq.(6) The emission current between the nearest neighbor
cells

r∈nn(R)

where the brackets [. . .]int denote the integer part of argument and
Pnn(R)
refers to the four nearest neighboring sites of R. Eq.(2) preserves the total
emission for transitions between the lattice sites . Other words, the natural
puriﬁcation of emission is absent, emissions are exclusively depleted by the
outﬂow through opened lattice bounds. For m(t, R)
1 the mass equidis-
tribution of emissions becomes satisﬁed with 1/√m order. Under these con-
ditions, Inn(t, R) acts as 2d Laplace of m, and thus CA rules describe the
stylized diﬀusive transport.

≫

The local concentration of emissions is permanently monitored by NS number
of sensing agents. The sensing agents are random walkers with the lattice
positions S(t, j)
[Sx(t, j), Sy(t, j)], j = 1, 2, . . ., NS. The lattice position of
the jth walker is given by

≡

Sx(t + 1, j) = [Sx(t, j) + sx(t, j)] mod L ,
Sy(t + 1, j) = [Sy(t, j) + sy(t, j)] mod L ;

where the shift s(t, j)
[sx(t, j), sy(t, j)] is chosen randomly from the set of

boundary conditions for S(t, j). Moreover, we checked that the statistical de-
pendencies studied in this paper do not change remarkably for closed boundary
conditions.

The source of emissions are the factory agents localized at random positions
F(t, k)
, k = 1, 2, . . . , NF . They are characterized by an integer
value of emission production n(t, k). The condition of sensorial feedback sys-
tem is that over a predetermined local pollution threshold mc every sensorial
agent with m(t, S(t, j)) > mc sends a feedback request to the nearest (in the
Euclidean sense) factory F(t, k(j)

The concentration threshold mc is analogous to that in Ref.[21] where the
feedback operation is mediated by the chemical sensors with speciﬁc thresholds
for diﬀerent pollutants. Any request of sensorial agent instantly decreases the
local emission production n(t, k) of the kth factory by a constant additive
factor ∆ > 0. In the absence of feedback signal, to satisfy economic needs, the
factory increases its production automatically. Both alternatives are described
by the equation

The eventuality n(t, k)
0 (zero emission means no production) yields the
bankruptcy of F(t, k) and the appearance of a new factory at random position
with initial production n(t + 1, k) = 0. The zero initial emission assure that
new factory may start its production only when it survives at least one time
period without feedback request. The total number of factories is conserved
by the death-birth rules. Since the production strategies of new generation
of factories does not change, the implicit assumption here is that system is
locked to the inferior technology [22].

What remains unspeciﬁed in Eq.(1) is the emission inﬂow caused by the F
type of agents

IF(t, R) = n(t, k) δR,F(t,k) .

(6)

It is worth nothing that all the agent systems in common with CA subsystem
are updated synchronously. The asynchronous update rules can be also of
interest, but we dismiss them from our considerations.

After the completion of the agent-based model, its relationship to the stan-
dard sandpile model of SOC [11] should be noted. The level of emissions is
confronted with a threshold which is similar to the height (slope) threshold
in SOC models. In sandpile models if the height of a pile exceeds a given
threshold, a ”signal” is transmitted to the central site and to its neighboring
sites. The abundant grains are then toppled from the center. Spatial expan-
sion of a sandpile avalanche corresponds to the emission spreading around a
factory agent. The power-law distribution of avalanches in sandpile model is
a consequence of the local conservation of sand grains. The property coincide
with the conservation of emissions, but contradicts to the non-local conserva-
tion of factory agents. The opened boundary conditions for emissions are also
borrowed from the sandpile model.

3 Simulation results

The simulations have been performed for lattices L = 20, 30, 40, 50. To avoid
the inﬂuence of transients, the initial 105 updates per site were discarded;
107 updates have been used to collect information about the

steady-state for the ﬁxed parameters mc = 5
∆ = 1. In further we limit
ourselves to the systems with ρF = NF/L2 = 1/100. In the world with large
number of sensors NS the emissions ﬂuctuate around mc. This oversaturated
population of the sensors prevents from unbearable contamination but yields
a non-eﬃcient economy. Much diﬀerent is the situation for NS small, where
the steady-state regime become unstable since the rate of emissions diverges
in time. The dynamics corresponds to a catastrophic regime. The preliminary
numerical work on steady-state statistics yields the conclusion that m(t, R) is

Such inhomogeneity induces secondary eﬀect of the accumulation of factories
at boundary regions. As L increases, the overall contribution of corners decays
faster than the contribution of edges. In this context, the important is the
aspect of ﬁnite-size scaling carried out in the next section.

The outcome of our simulation experience is the decision to accumulate the

The problem with sensorial system manifests itself when θ < θcrit. In this
regime a sensor multiply aﬀects the same nearest factory and lowers its emis-
sion production, while other hidden sources, maybe more inﬂuential and dan-
gerous polluters, could left without feedback requests. Hereafter, this process is
referred as spatial screening. The screening emerges as a result of co-evolution
and self-organization in multi-agent system. The statistical signiﬁcance of the
screening is clariﬁed in Fig.2 where the auxiliary order parameter

are usually related to the overall production of goods with a proportionality
factor called emission-output ratio. Standard and widely accepted assumption
is that this ratio is ﬁxed and irrespective to the investments in clean technol-
ogy. With such idealization, the critical ﬂuctuations of n(t, k) can be assigned
to the empirical Zipf’s law. As we see from Fig.4, the cumulative probability
distribution function pdf>(n) corresponding to (NS, L)- parametric domain
have been characterized by the eﬀective exponents within the broad range

to ﬁx the realistic exponents of the Zipf’s law (according Ref.[23] the empirical
exponents are β = 0.84; 0.995).

Since the place for new factory is chosen randomly, the snapshots showing the
spatial distributions of F agents evoke the images of the short-range ordered
molecular patterns. From this perspective the system of factories have fea-
tures of 2d molecular liquid or ”vapor”. Within such viewpoint the ”vapor”
of F(t, k) agents prepared for θ > θcrit belongs to the safe economy, whereas
stronger correlated ”liquid condensate” (θ < θcrit) corresponds to the catas-
trophic regime. In further, these arguments are applied in favor of scenario
of discontinuous transition.

Next, the system is studied via nonequilibrium relaxation method[25] that
is an eﬃcient tool of analysis of equilibrium phase transitions. The numerical
results are shown in Fig.6. The initial conﬁguration has been prepared in a such

The resulting relaxation dependence is then constructed by averaging over

strongly depends on how far θ is from θcrit. Three distinct dynamical regimes
have been identiﬁed when inspecting averaged relaxation process. In early
stage of development practically all sensors are active since
1. Later,
when content of the most of cells are still above mc, relatively fast exponential
relaxation dominates. It corresponds to the puriﬁcation through bounds. As
it can be clearly seen, the processes at large times are well separated from
the initial relaxation. The long-time process is associated with the positional
adjustment (or self-organization) of the factories.

4 Conclusions

The statistical properties of the multi-agent system including the environmen-
tal-economic interactions have been studied. It should be noted that at early
stages of the work we were motivated by the particular hypothesis about im-
plementation of feedback and direct generation of SOC regime. However, even

10

preliminary runs have uncovered that not all the regimes conducted by feed-
back acquire SOC signatures as are the power-law distributions and power-law
autocorrelation functions. With these facts in mind, we shift our focus to give
an interpretation in terms of phase transitions (”unstable” in sense of Ref.[12]).
Our simulation conﬁrmed that only optimized feedback induces attractiveness
of the critical state. In other words, the distributed feedback (as many other
approaches) does not automatically guarantees the attractiveness of critical
point. The agents proposed here hold only rudimentary thinking and thus more
intelligent entities should be considered in future work. A variety of problems
can be formulated where the establishment of new factory is subjected to a
place-search optimization strategy. With such modiﬁcation the formation of
highly correlated factory - sensorial agent structures are expected. One can
extend the idea to models with crystal-like ordering and formation of the
compact aggregates of factories - industrial complexes enhancing the eﬀect of
screening. An alternative representation of distributed feedback mechanism
may be the notion of individual energy taxation of factories which is pro-
portional to the local contamination level. Contrary to plethora of possible
additional realistic entries omitted, the hypothesis posed by simulation is that
the phase transition appears to be a generic statistical aspect of the groups of
autonomous agents with conﬂicting interests. The main implication from the
present model is the identiﬁcation of power-law (nearly catastrophic) pdf’s of
ﬂuctuations of emission rates. We believe that focus to power-law distributions
will open new perspectives of the environmental diagnostics.

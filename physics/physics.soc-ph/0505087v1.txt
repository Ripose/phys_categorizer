While current studies on complex networks focus on systems that change relatively slowly in time,
the structure of the most visited regions of the Web is altered at the timescale from hours to days.
Here we investigate the dynamics of visitation of a major news portal, representing the prototype
for such a rapidly evolving network. The nodes of the network can be classiﬁed into stable nodes,
that form the time independent skeleton of the portal, and news documents. The visitation of the
two node classes are markedly diﬀerent, the skeleton acquiring visits at a constant rate, while a
news document’s visitation peaking after a few hours. We ﬁnd that the visitation pattern of a
news document decays as a power law, in contrast with the exponential prediction provided by
simple models of site visitation. This is rooted in the inhomogeneous nature of the browsing pattern
characterizing individual users: the time interval between consecutive visits by the same user to the
site follows a power law distribution, in contrast with the exponential expected for Poisson processes.
We show that the exponent characterizing the individual user’s browsing patterns determines the
power-law decay in a document’s visitation. Finally, our results document the ﬂeeting quality of
news and events: while ﬁfteen minutes of fame is still an exaggeration in the online media, we ﬁnd
that access to most news items signiﬁcantly decays after 36 hours of posting.

The recent interest in the topological properties of
complex networks is driven by the realization that under-
standing the evolutionary processes responsible for net-
work formation is crucial for comprehending the topolog-
ical maps describing many real systems [1–9]. A much
studied example is the WWW, whose topology is driven
by its continued expansion through the addition of new
documents and links. This growth process has inspired
a series of network models that reproduce some of the
most studied topological features of the Web [10–17].
The bulk of the current topology driven research focuses
on the so called publicly indexable web, which changes
only slowly, and therefore can be reproduced with rea-
sonable accuracy. In contrast, the most visited portion
of the WWW, ranging from news portals to commercial
sites, change within hours through the rapid addition and
removal of documents and links. This is driven by the
ﬂeeting quality of news:
in contrast with the 24-hour
news cycle of the printed press, in the online media the
non-stop stream of new developments often obliterates
an event within hours. But the WWW is not the only
rapidly evolving network: the wiring of a cell’s regulatory
network can also change very rapidly during cell cycle or
when there are rapid changes in environmental and stress
factors [7]. Similarly, while in social networks the cumu-
lative number of friends and acquaintances an individual
has is relatively stable, an individual’s contact network,
representing those that it interacts with during a given
time interval, is often signiﬁcantly altered from one day
to the other. Given the widespread occurrence of these
rapidly changing networks, it is important to understand
their topology and dynamical features.

Here we take a ﬁrst step in this direction by studying
as a model system a news portal, consisting of news items

that are added and removed at a rapid rate. In particu-
lar, we focus on the interplay between the network and
the visitation history of the individual documents.
In
this context, users are often modeled as random walk-
ers, that move along the links of the WWW. Most re-
search on diﬀusion on complex networks [18–26] ignores
the precise timing of the visit to a particular web docu-
ment. There are good reasons for this: such topological
quantities as mean free path or probability of return to
the starting point can be expressed using the diﬀusion
time, where each time step corresponds to a single dif-
fusion step. Other approaches assume that the diﬀusion
pattern is a Poisson process [27], so that the probabil-
ity of an HTML request in a dt time interval is pdt. In
contrast, here we show that the timing of the browsing
process is non-Poisson, which has a signiﬁcant impact on
the visitation history of web documents as well.

I. DATASET AND NETWORK STRUCTURE

Automatically assigned cookies allow us to reconstruct
the browsing history of approximately 250,000 unique
visitors of the largest Hungarian news and entertainment
portal (origo.hu), which provides online news and maga-
zines, community pages, software downloads, free email
and search engine, capturing 40% of all internal Web traf-
ﬁc in Hungary. The portal receives 6,500,000 HTML hits
on a typical workday. We used the log ﬁles of the portal
to collect the visitation pattern of each visitor between
11/08/02 and 12/08/02, the number of new news docu-
ments released in this time period being 3,908.

From a network perspective most web portals consist
of a stable skeleton, representing the overall organization

1

of the web portal, and a large number of news items that
are documents only temporally linked to the skeleton.
Each news item represents a particular web document
with a unique URL. A typical news item is added to the
main page, as well as to the speciﬁc news subcategories
to which it belongs. For example, the report about an
important soccer match could start out simultaneously
on the front page, the sports page and the soccer subdi-
rectory of the sports page. As a news document “ages”,
new developments compete for space, thus the document
is gradually removed from the main page, then from the
sports page and eventually from the soccer page as well.
After some time (which varies from document to docu-
ment) an older news document, while still available on
the portal, will be disconnected from the skeleton, and
can be accessed only through a search engine. To fully
understand the dynamics of this network, we need to dis-
tinguish between the stable skeleton and the news docu-
ments with heavily time dependent visitation.

The documents belonging to the skeleton are charac-
terized by an approximately constant daily visitation pat-
tern, thus the cumulative number of visitors accessing
them increases linearly in time. In contrast, the visita-
tion of news documents is the highest right after their
release and decreases in time, thus their cumulative vis-
itation reaches a saturation after several days. This is
illustrated in Fig. 1, where we show the cumulative visi-
tation for the main page (www.origo.hu/index.html) and
a typical news item.

FIG. 1. The cumulative number of visits to a typical skele-
ton document (a) and a news document (b). The diﬀerence
between the two visitation patterns allows us to distinguish
between news documents and the stable documents belonging
to the skeleton.

The diﬀerence between the two visitation patterns al-
lows us to distinguish in an automated fashion the web-
sites belonging to the skeleton from the news documents.
For this we make a linear regression to each site’s cumu-
lative visitation pattern and calculate the deviation from
the ﬁtted lines, documents with very small deviations
being assigned to the skeleton. The validity of the algo-
rithm was checked by inspecting the URL of randomly
selected documents, as the skeleton and the news docu-

2

ments in most cases have a diﬀerent format. But given
some ambiguities in the naming system, we used the vis-
itation based distinction to ﬁnalize the classiﬁcation of
the documents into skeleton and news.

When visiting a news portal, we often get the impres-
sion that it has a hierarchical structure. As shown in
Fig. 2 the skeleton forms a complex network, driving the
visitation patterns of the users. Indeed, the main site,
shown in the center, is the most visited, and the docu-
ments to which it directly links to also represent highly
visited sites. In general (with a few notable exceptions,
however), the further we go from the main site on the
network, the smaller is the visitation. The skeleton of
the studied portal has 933 documents with an average
degree close to 2 (i.e. it is largely a tree, with only a few
loops, conﬁrming our impression of a hierarchical topol-
ogy), the network having a few well connected nodes (or
hubs), while many are linked to the skeleton by a single
link [16,17].

FIG. 2. The skeleton of the studied web portal has 933
nodes. The area of the circles assigned to each node in the
ﬁgure is proportional with the logarithm of the total num-
ber of visits to the corresponding web document. The width
of the links are proportional with the logarithm of the to-
tal number of times the hyperlink was used by the surfers
on the portal. The central largest node corresponds to the
main page (www.origo.hu/index.html) directly connected to
several other highly visited sites.

II. THE DYNAMICS OF NETWORK VISITATION

Given that the diﬀerence between the skeleton and the
news documents is driven by the visitation patterns, next
we focus on the interplay between the visitation pattern
of individual users and the overall visitation of a doc-
ument. The overall visitation of a speciﬁc document is

expected to be determined both by the document’s posi-
tion on the web page, as well as the content’s potential
importance for various user groups. In general the num-
ber of visits n(t) to a news document follows a dampened
periodic pattern: the majority of visits (28%) take place
within the ﬁrst day, decaying to only 7% on the second
day, and reaching a small but apparently constant visi-
tation beyond four days (Fig 3a). Given that after a day
or two most news are archived, the long-term saturation
of visitation corresponds to direct search or traﬃc from
outside links.

To understand the origin of the observed decay in visi-
tation, we assume that the portal has N users, each read-
ing the news document of direct interest for him/her.
Therefore, at every time step each user reads a given
document with probability p. Users will not read the
same news more than once, therefore the number of users
which have not read a given document decreases with
time. We can calculate the time dependence of the num-
ber of potential readers to a news document using

dN (t)
dt

= −N (t)p

where N (t) is the number of visitors which have not read
the selected news document by time t. The probability

(1)

3

that a new user reads the news document is given by
N (t)p. Equation (1) predicts that

N (t) = N exp(−t/t1/2)

(2)

where t1/2 = 1/p, characterizing the halftime of the news
item. The number of visits (n) in unit time is given by

n(t) = − dN
dt

=

N
t1/2

exp(−t/t1/2).

(3)

Our measurements indicate, however, that in contrast
with this exponential prediction the visitation does not
decay exponentially, but its asymptotic behavior is best
approximated by a power law (Fig 3c)

n(t) ∼ t

−β

(4)

with β = 0.3 ± 0.1, so that while the bulk of the visits
takes place at small t, a considerable number of visits are
recorded well beyond the document’s release time.

Indeed, Eqs.

Next we show that the failure of the exponential model
is rooted in the uneven browsing patterns of the individ-
ual users.

the users visit the site in regular fashion such that they

week are undercounted in the month long dataset. The con-
tinuous line has slope α = 1.2 (b) The halftime distribution
for individual news items, following a power-law with expo-
nent −1.5 ± 0.1.

This means that for each user numerous frequent
downloads are followed by long periods of inactivity, a
bursting, non-Poisson activity pattern that is a generic
feature of human behavior [28] and it is observed in many
natural and human driven dynamical processes [29–40].
In the following we show that this uneven user visitation
pattern is responsible for the slow decay in the visitation

of a news document and that n(t) can be derived from
the browsing pattern of the individual users.

Let us assume that a given news document was released
at time t0 and that all users visiting the main page after
the release read that news. Because each user reads each
document only once, the visitation of a given document
is determined by the number of new users visiting the
page where the document is featured.

To further test the validity of our predictions we stud-
ied the relationship between α and β for the more gen-
eral case, when a user that visits the main page reads a
news item with probability p. We numerically generated
browsing patterns for 10,000 users, the distribution for
the time intervals between two consecutive visits, P (τ ),
following a power-law with exponent α = 1.5 (Fig. 6
inset).

the time they could ﬁrst visit and read the article.

In Fig. 5 we show the browsing pattern for four diﬀer-
ent users, each vertical line representing a separate visit
to the main page. The thick lines show for each user
the ﬁrst time they visit the main page after the studied
news document was released at t0. The release time of
the news (t0) divides the time interval τ into two con-
secutive visits of length t′ and t, where t + t′ = τ . The
probability that a user visits at time t after the news was
released is proportional to the number of possible τ in-
tervals, which for a given t is proportional to the possible
values of t′ given by the number of intervals having a
length larger than t,

the decay in the news visitation to β in Eq. (4), char-
acterizing the visitation pattern of individual users, pro-
viding the relation

FIG. 6. We numerically generated browsing patterns for
10,000 users, the distribution of the time intervals between
two consecutive visits by the same user following a power-law
with exponent α = 1.5. We assume that users visiting the
main page will read a given news item with probability p.
The number of visits per unit time decays as a power-law
with exponent β = 0.5 for four diﬀerent values of p (circles for
p = 1, squares for p = 0.7, diamonds for p = 0.5 and triangle
for p = 0.3). The empty circles represent the visitation of
a news item if the users follow a Poisson browsing pattern.
We keep the average time between two consecutive visit of
each user the same as the one observed in the real data. As
the ﬁgures indicates, the Poisson browsing pattern cannot
reproduce the real visitation decay of a document, predicting
a much faster (exponential) decay.

In Fig. 6 we calculate the visits for a given news item,
assuming that the users visiting the main page read the
news with probability p, characterizing the ”stickiness”
or the potential interest in a news item. As we see in the
ﬁgure the value of β is close to 0.5 as predicted by (7).
Furthermore, we ﬁnd that β is independent of p, indicat-
ing that the inter-event time distribution P (τ ) character-
izing the individual browsing patterns is the main factor
that determines the visitation decay of a news document,
the diﬀerence in the content (stickiness) of the news play-
ing no signiﬁcant role. As a reference, we also determined
the decay in the visitation assuming that the users fol-
low a Poisson visitation pattern [27] with the same inter-
event time as observed in the real data. As Fig. 6 shows,
a Poisson visitation pattern leads to a much faster decay
in document visitation then the power-law seen in Fig.
3c. Indeed, using Poisson inter-event time distribution in
(5) would predict an exponentially decaying tail for n(t).

4

It is useful to characterize the interest in a news doc-
ument by its half time (T1/2), corresponding to the time
frame during which half of all visitors that eventually ac-
cess it have visited. We ﬁnd that the overall half-time
distribution follows a power law (Fig. 4b), indicating
that while most news have a very short lifetime, a few
continue to be accessed well beyond their initial release.
The average halftime of a news document is 36 hours, i.e.
after a day and a half the interest in most news fades.
A similar broad distribution is observed when we inspect
the total number of visits a news document receives (Fig.
7), indicating that the vast majority of news generate lit-
tle interest, while a few are highly popular [41]. Similar
weight distributions are observed in a wide range of com-
plex networks [42–46].

The short display time of a given news document, com-
bined with the uneven visitation pattern indicates that
users could miss a signiﬁcant fraction of the news by not
visiting the portal when a document is displayed. We
ﬁnd that a typical user sees only 53% of all news items
appearing on the main page of the portal, and downloads
(reads) only 7% of them. Such shallow news penetration
is likely common in all media, but hard to quantify in
the absence of tools to track the reading patterns of in-
dividuals.

III. DISCUSSION

Our main goal in this paper was to explore the inter-
play between individual human visitation patterns and
the visitation of speciﬁc websites on a web portal. While
we often tend to think that the visitation of a given doc-
ument is driven only by its popularity, our results oﬀer
a more complex picture: the dynamics of its accessibility
is equally important. Indeed, while “ﬁfteen minutes of

5

fame” does not yet apply to the online world, our mea-
surements indicate that the visitation of most news items
decays signiﬁcantly after 36 hours of posting. The aver-
age lifetime must vary for diﬀerent media, but the decay
laws we identiﬁed are likely generic, as they do not de-
pend on content, but are determined mainly by the users’
visitation and browsing patterns [28]. These ﬁndings also
oﬀer a potential explanation of the observation that the
visitation of a website decreases as a power law follow-
ing a peak of visitation after the site was featured in the
media [47]. Indeed, the observed power law decay most
likely characterizes the dynamics of the original news ar-
ticle, which, due to the uneven visitation patterns of the
users, displays a power law visitation decay (see eq. (4)).
These results are likely not limited to news portals. In-
deed, we are faced with equally dynamic network when
we look at commercial sites, where items are being taken
oﬀ the website as they are either sold or not carried any
longer. It is very likely that the visitation of the individ-
ual users to such commercial sites also follows a power
law interevent time, potentially leading to a power law
decay in an item’s visitation. The results might be ap-
plicable to biological systems as well, where the stable
network represents the skeleton of the regulatory or the
metabolic network, indicating which nodes could interact
[45,7], while the rapidly changing nodes correspond to the
actual molecules that are present in a given moment in
the cell. As soon as a molecule is consumed by a reaction
or transported out of the cell, it disappears from the sys-
tem. Before that happens, however, it can take place in
multiple interactions. Indeed, there is increasing experi-
mental evidence that network usage in biological systems
is highly time dependent [48,49].

While most research on information access focuses on
search engines [50], a signiﬁcant fraction of new informa-
tion we are exposed to comes from news, whose source is
increasingly shifting online from the traditional printed
and audiovisual media. News, however, have a ﬂeeting
in contrast with the 24-hour news cycle of the
quality:
printed press, in the online and audiovisual media the
non-stop stream of new developments often obliterates
a news event within hours. Through archives the In-
ternet oﬀers better long-term search-based access to old
events then any other media before. Yet, if we are not
exposed to a news item while prominently featured, it is
unlikely that we will know what to search for. The ac-
celerating news cycle raises several important questions:
How long is a piece of news accessible without targeted
search? What is the dynamics of news accessibility? The
results presented above show that the online media allows
us to address these questions in a quantitative manner,
oﬀering surprising insights into the universal aspects of
information dynamics. Such quantitative approaches to
online media not only oﬀer a better understanding of in-
formation access, but could have important commercial
applications as well, from better portal design to under-
standing information diﬀusion [51–53], ﬂow [54] and mar-
keting in the online world.

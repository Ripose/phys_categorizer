In this article, we investigate an artiﬁcial traﬃc model on scale-free networks. Instead of using
the routing strategy of the shortest path, a generalized routing algorithm is introduced to improve
the transportation throughput, which is measured by the value of the critical point disjoining the
free-ﬂow phase and the congested phase. By using the detrended ﬂuctuation analysis, we found
that the traﬃc rate ﬂuctuation near the critical point exhibits the 1/f -type scaling in the power
spectrum. The simulation results agree very well with the empirical data, thus the present model
may contribute to the understanding of the underlying mechanism of network traﬃcs.

INTRODUCTION

Complex networks can be used to describe a wide range
of systems from nature to society, thus there has been a
quickly growing interest in this area since the discoveries
on small-world phenomena [1] and scale-free properties
[2]. Due to the increasing importance of large commu-
nication networks upon which our society survives, the
dynamical processes taking place upon the underlying
structures such as traﬃcs of information ﬂow have draw
more and more attentions from the physical and engi-
neering communities. Previous studies on understanding
and controlling traﬃc congestion on network have a basic
assumption that the network has a homogeneous struc-
ture [3, 4, 5, 6]. However, many real communication net-
works, including the Internet [7] and WWW [8], display
the scale-free property. Therefore it is of great interest
to explore how this highly heterogenous topology aﬀects
the traﬃc dynamics, which have brought a number of
research works in recent years (see the review paper [9]
and the references therein).

To improve the transportation eﬃciency on complex
networks, Guimer´a et al. presented a formalism that
can deal simultaneously with the searching and traﬃc
dynamics in parallel transportation systems [10]. This
formalism can be used to optimize network structure un-
der a local search algorithm through the knowledge of the
global information of whole network. By using a global
and dynamical searching algorithm aimed at the short-
est paths, Zhao et al. provided the theoretical estimates
of the communication capacity [11]. Holme proposed a
much intelligent routing protocol in which the packet can
detour at obstacle thus guarantee much better perfor-
mance than the traditional routing strategy which just
waits at obstacle [12]. Since the global information is
usually unavailable in large-scale networks, Tadi´c et al.
proposed a traﬃc model on a mimic WWW network [13]
wherein only local information, is available. This work

highlighted the relationship of global statistical proper-
ties and microscopic density ﬂuctuations [14, 15]. In ad-
dition, Yin et al. [16, 17] investigated how the local rout-
ing protocol aﬀects the traﬃc condition. The routing
strategies for the Internet [18] and disordered networks
[19] are also studied.

Recent empirical studies on communication networks
have found pervasive evidence of some surprising scal-
ing properties. One example of such discoveries is that
the traﬃc rates of a given link in the Internet (i.e. the
number of packets or bytes traversing a given link per
time unit) exhibit the self-similar (or fractal-like) scaling,
and the multifractal scaling is also found over small time

scales [6, 20, 21, 22, 23]. These empirical studies describe
pertinent statistical characteristics of temporal dynamics
of measured traﬃc rate process and provide ample evi-
dence that these traces are consistent with long-range
correlated behavior. Faloutsos et al. concerned the au-
tonomous system (AS) of the Internet and pointed out for
the ﬁrst time that the degree distribution of snapshots in
the AS level follows a heavy-tailed function that can be
reasonably approximated by power-law forms [24]. Fol-
lowing these pioneering works, Percacci et al. found that
the round trip time (RTT) or Internet delay time can also
be characterized by a slow power-law decay [25]. This
ﬁnding implies that network inter-connectivity topology
structure of Internet and transportation delay both have
a highly heterogenous characteristic. Thus, the assump-
tion of Poisson process, which had been a major traﬃc
model with homogeneous network in the traditional traf-
ﬁc theory, has clearly lost its validity. This is also the
very reason why in this article we use scale-free networks
for simulations. Furthermore, the observation of a phase
transition between the free-ﬂow phase and the congested
phase in the Internet traﬃc is demonstrated by Takayasu
et al.
through both the RTT experiment [26, 27] and
packet ﬂow ﬂuctuation analysis [28, 29]. However, the
1/f -type scaling is only detected near the critical state
[26, 27, 28, 29].

In this article, we investigate a traﬃc model on scale-
free networks, in which packets are routed according to
the global topological information with a single tunable
parameter β. Instead of using the routing strategy based
on the shortest paths, we give a generalized routing algo-
rithm to ﬁnd the so-called eﬃcient path to improve the
transportation eﬃciency that is measured by the value
of the critical point disjoining the free-ﬂow and the con-
gested phases. Furthermore, by using the detrended ﬂuc-
tuation analysis, we investigate the statistic properties of
traﬃc rate process (i.e. depicted by the number of pack-
ets per time unit) based on this traﬃc model, which is in
good accordance with the empirical data.

with size N = 1225 (up panel) and N = 1500 (down panel).
Both the simulation (black squares) and analysis (red circles)
demonstrate that the maximal Rc corresponds to β ≈ 1.0.
The results are the average over 10 independent runs.

II. MODEL

In this paper, we treat all the nodes as both hosts and
routers [10, 30]. The model is described as follows: at
each time step, there are R packets generated in the sys-
tem, with randomly chosen sources and destinations. It
is assumed that all the routers have the same capabili-
ties in delivering and handling information packets, that
is, at each time step all the nodes can deliver at most
C packets one step toward their destinations according
to the routing strategy. We set C = 1 for simplicity.
A packet, once reaching its destination, is removed from
the system. We are most interested in the critical value
Rc where a phase transition takes place from free ﬂow
to congested traﬃc. This critical value can best reﬂect
the maximum capability of a system handling its traﬃc.
In particular, for R < Rc, the numbers of created and

delivered packets are balanced, leading to a steady free
traﬃc ﬂow. For R > Rc, traﬃc congestion occurs as the
number of accumulated packets increases with time, sim-
ply for that the capacities of nodes for delivering packets
are limited. To characterize the phase transition, we use
the following order parameter

H(R) = lim
t→∞

C
R

h∆W i
∆t

,

(1)

where ∆W = W (t + ∆t) − W (t), with h· · · i indicating
average over time windows of width ∆t, and W (t) is the
total number of packets in the network at time t. Clearly,
H equals zero in the free-ﬂow state, and becomes positive
when R exceeds Rc.

Consider the routing under global protocol [31], where
the whole structural information is available, and the
ﬁxed routing algorithm is the most widely used one
for its obvious advantages in economical and technical

those high-degree nodes, a packet may reach its desti-
nation quicker than taking the shortest path. In order
to ﬁnd the optimal routing strategy, we deﬁne the eﬃ-
cient path [31]. For any path between nodes i and j as

L(P (i → j) : β) =

where k(xi) denotes the degree of the node xi, and β
is a tunable parameter. The eﬃcient path between i
and j is corresponding to the route that makes the sum
L(P (i → j) : β) minimum. Obviously, Lmin(β = 0)
recovers the traditionally shortest path length. As for
any pair of source and destination, there may be several
eﬃcient paths between them. We randomly choose one
of them and put it into the ﬁxed routing table which is
followed by all the information packets.

costs [32, 33]. Actually, the path with shortest length
is not necessarily the quickest way, considering the pres-
ence of possible traﬃc congestion and waiting time along
the shortest path. Obviously, nodes with larger de-
gree are more likely to bear traﬃc congestion, thus a
packet will by average spend more waiting time to pass
through a high-degree node. All too often, bypassing

The packets handling and delivering capacity of the
whole network is an index of performance in traﬃc sys-
tem, which can be measured by the critical value Rc. At
the critical value Rc, a continuous transition will be ob-
servation from the free-ﬂow phase to the congested phase.
Fig. 1 shows the order parameter H versus R with dif-
ferent β, in which the obvious phase transitions occur.
For diﬀerent β, it is easy to ﬁnd that the capacities of
systems are much diﬀerent.

B. Optimal routing strategy

We select packet routing strategy through a tunable
parameter β, and the capacity of whole network are much
diﬀerent. A natural question arises: Which value of β
will lead to the maximal capacity of the network.
In
Fig. 2, we report the simulation results for the critical
value Rc as a function of β on BA networks with the size
N = 1225 and N = 1500, which demonstrate that the
optimal routing strategy is corresponding to β = 1 and
the size of BA network doesn’t aﬀect the optimal value.
In comparison with the traditional routing strategy (i.e.
β = 0), the capacity Rc of the whole network is greatly
improved more than 10 times without any increase in
algorithmic complexity.

All the data are obtained from the free-ﬂow state, and the

By extending the concept of betweenness centrality
[34, 35] to eﬃcient betweenness centrality [36], the an-
alytic results can be obtained according to the Little’s
law (One can ﬁnd the concept of eﬃcient betweenness
and the details about the analytical approach in Refs.
[10, 11, 31]). The analytical results are also shown in
Fig. 2, which agree very well with the simulations.

critical and congested states, respectively. As time goes
on, W (t) in the congested state will become too large to
be plotted together with those in free and critical state.
Therefore, each curve representing the congested state
in Fig. 3 is anteriorly divided by a very large number.
Those numbers are not the same for diﬀerent simulations,
and do not have any physical meanings, they are just used
to make the ﬁgure more clear. The behaviors of W (t)
in the free and congested states are very simple: In the
former case, it ﬂuctuates slightly around a very low value,
while in the latter case, it increases linearly. However, the
time series at the critical point is very complicated, we
next detect its scaling property by using the detrended
ﬂuctuation analysis.

B. Detrended ﬂuctuation analysis

The empirical study on the self-similar scaling behavior
of traﬃc rate process can be ﬁrstly found in pioneer ref-
erences [37, 38]. The autocorrelation function and power
spectrum are widely used to analyse the the self-similar
scaling behavior of data [39, 40, 41, 42]. However, it is
shown that all the above methods don’t work very well
for the eﬀect of non-stationary, and are less accurate than
the detrended ﬂuctuation analysis (DFA) [43, 44, 45],
which has now been accepted as an important time series
analysis approach and widely used especially for ﬁnancial
and biological data [46, 47, 48, 49, 50].

The DFA method is based on the idea that a corre-
lated time series can be mapped to a self-similar process
by an integration. Therefore, measuring the self-similar
feature can indirectly tell us the information about the
correlation properties [43, 44]. Brieﬂy, the description of
the DFA algorithm involves the following steps.

(1) Consider a time series xi, i = 1, · · · , N , where N is

the length of this series. Determine the proﬁle

where

(3)

The empirical studies on communication networks con-
ﬁrm the existence of critical phenomena in traﬃc rate
process [28, 29]. The Congestion duration length dis-
tribution obeys a power-law form with an approximate
exponent -1 in critical state, which implies the self-
similarity scaling exponent (Hurst exponent) H ≈ 1.
Actually, H < 1/2 stands for an anti-persistent long-
range correlated process in which a step in one direction
is preferentially followed by a reversal of direction, while
H > 1/2 is interpreted as a persistent long-range corre-
lated process in which a step in one direction is preferen-
tially followed by another step in the same direction. A
value of H = 1/2 is interpreted as the ordinary diﬀusion
(random walk), in which each step is independent of its
preceding one.

In Fig. 3, we report the average number of packets over
all the nodes, W (t) = W (t)/N , as a time series in free,

(2) Divide proﬁle y(i) into non-overlapping boxes of

equal size t.

(3) Calculate the local trend yfit in each box of size
t by a least-square ﬁt of the series, and the detrended
ﬂuctuation function is given as

Y (k) = y(k) − yfit(k).

a straight line, then F (t) obeys the power-law form tH
with H the slope of this line.

As shown in Fig. 4, the mimic traﬃc rate process also
exhibits the self-similar scaling behaviors at the critical
point of phase transition. The scaling exponents calcu-
lated with DFA for diﬀerent β are approximate H ≈ 1,
and the value of β has almost no eﬀect on H. This value
of H implies the 1/f -type scaling in the power spectrum
and the long-range correlated behavior in a wide range of
scales. A very recent empirical study on the traﬃc rate
process of a University Ethernet has demonstrated that
the real Ethernet traﬃc displays a self-similarity behav-
ior with scaling exponent ≈ 0.98 [51], which agrees well
with the present result H ≈ 1.

In order to conﬁrm that the critical behavior only ex-
ists in the critical state (as is shown in some previuos
empirical studies) [26, 27, 28, 29], we analysis the traﬃc
rate processes in the free-ﬂow state. Fig. 5 suggests that
traﬃc rate processes in free state are completely diﬀerent
from those in the critical state, which exhibit a very weak
long-range correlated behavior with exponent H = 0.55.
Clearly, if the transporting time of each packet is ex-
actly the same as the path length (i.e. a packet does not
need to wait at any nodes in the path from its source
to destination), there should be no long-range correla-

present model, even in the free-ﬂow state, a packet may
wait some time steps at some nodes before reaching to
its destination. That is the reason leading to the weak

long-range correlation. However, the waiting eﬀect in the
free-ﬂow state is triﬂing for the Hurst exponent is close
to 0.5.

V. CONCLUSION

In conclusion, we have proposed a traﬃc model based
on packet routing strategy aiming at eﬃcient paths in-
stead of the shortest paths. This work may be useful
for designing communication protocols for highly hetero-
geneous networks since the present strategy can sharply
enhance the throughput without any increase in its al-
gorithmic complexity. The traﬃc rate process generated
by this model exhibits critical self-similar scaling behav-
ior with exponent ≈ 1, which implies the 1/f -type scaling
in the power spectrum and the long-range correlated be-
havior in a wide range of scales. The scaling behaviors of
the present model is in good accordance with the empir-
ical data, thus this model may have got hold of some key
ingredients of the underlying mechanism of real traﬃc.

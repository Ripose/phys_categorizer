Abstract

The possibility that price dynamics is aﬀected by its distance from a moving average has been recently introduced as
new statistical tool. The purpose is to identify the tendency of the price dynamics to be attractive or repulsive with
respect to its own moving average. We consider a number of tests for various models which clarify the advantages
and limitations of this new approach. The analysis leads to the identiﬁcation of an eﬀective potential with respect
to the moving average. Its speciﬁc implementation requires a detailed consideration of various eﬀects which can
alter the statistical methods used. However, the study of various model systems shows that this approach is indeed
suitable to detect hidden forces in the market which go beyond usual correlations and volatility clustering.

1. Introduction

The concept of moving average is very popular in
empirical trading algorithms [1] but, up to now, it
has received little attention from a scientiﬁc point
of view [2, 3, 4]. Recently we have proposed that
a new deﬁnition of roughness can be introduced
by considering ﬂuctuations from moving averages
with diﬀerent time scales [5]. This new deﬁnition

seems to have various advantages with respect to
the usual Hurst exponent in describing the ﬂuctu-
ations of high frequencies stock-prices.

A more speciﬁc analysis of these ﬂuctuations can
be found in two recent papers [6, 7] which attempt
to determine the tendency of the price to be at-
tracted or repelled from its own moving average
(Fig. 1). This is completely diﬀerent from the use
of moving averages in ﬁnance, in which empirical
rules and predictions are deﬁned in terms of a pri-
ori concepts [1]. The idea is instead to introduce a
statistical framework which is able to extract these

Fig. 1. Example of a model of price dynamics (in this case
a simple random walk) together with its moving average
deﬁned as the average over the previous 50 points. The idea
is that the distance of the price from its moving average can
lead to repulsive (blue arrows) or attractive (red arrows)
eﬀective forces.

2. The Eﬀective Potential Model

The basic idea is to describe price dynamics in
terms of an active random walk (RW) which is
inﬂuenced by its own moving average. This induces
complex long range correlations which cannot be
determined by the usual correlation functions and
that can be explored by this new approach [6, 7].
The basic ansatz is that price dynamics P (t) can
be described in terms of a stochastic equation of
type:

P (t+1)−P (t) =
d

=−b(t)

d

P (t)−PM (t)

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

(cid:16)
+ σ(t)ω(t)

(cid:17)

where ω(t) corresponds to a random noise with
unitary variance and

PM (t) ≡

P (t − k)

is the moving average over the previous M steps.
The potential Φ together with the pre-factor b(t)
describe the interaction between the price and the

moving average. In both approaches [6, 7] it is as-
sumed to be quadratic:

(cid:17)

φ

P (t) − PM (t)

=

P (t) − PM (t)

(3)

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

(cid:16)

Despite this similar starting point the two stud-
ies proceed along rather diﬀerent perspectives. In
Ref. [6] the three essential parameters of the model
(b; M ; σ) are considered as constants with respect
to t. Then, by analyzing the price ﬂuctuations over
a suitable time interval and for a long time series,
the values of the three parameters are identiﬁed.

In Ref. [7] instead the analysis is performed by
looking directly at the relation between P (t + 1) −
P (t) and P (t) − PM (t). This permits to derive the
form of the potential and to identify the parameter
b(t) and its time variation. For the US$/Yen ex-
change rates the potential is found to be quadratic
and it is possible to rescale it with the term 1/(M −
1) observing a good data collapse. This would im-
ply that it is not necessary to specify the time scale
of the moving average.

3. Test Studies

Given these diﬀerent perspectives, which arise
from the same basic model, we decided to perform
a series of tests of this approach which we present
in this paper. We believe that these tests can eluci-
date various properties and limitations of the new
approach and represent a useful information for its
future developments and applications.

In Fig. 1 we show a simple RW and a moving
average which represents its own smoothed proﬁle.
The analysis is performed by plotting the values
of P (t + 1) − P (t) as a function of P (t) − PM (t)
and deriving the potential by integrating from the
center [7]. The simple RW leads to a ﬂat potential
(no force) as expected (Fig. 2). Than we can take
the smoothed proﬁle (previous moving average) as
a dataset by itself and repeat the analysis by com-
paring it to a new, smoother moving average (not
shown). As one can see in Fig. 2 this leads to an
apparent repulsive potential which should be con-
sidered as spurious. This is due to the fact that the
smoothed curve implies some positive correlations
as shown in Fig. 3. Therefore in this framework

Fig. 3. Autocorrelation (ρ) of the price increments for the
simple RW and its smoothed proﬁle. One can see that the
smoothing procedure induces positive correlations up to
the smoothing length (in this case 10 steps).

positive correlations lead to a destabilizing poten-
tial with respect to the moving average. The op-
posite would happen for negative correlations (zig-
zag behavior).

The interesting question is however if one can
identify a non trivial situation in terms of the eﬀec-
tive potential but in absence of simple correlations.
This would be the new, interesting situation and
the corresponding forces can be considered as hid-
den, in the sense that they do not have any eﬀect in
the usual correlation functions. Real stock-prices
data clearly do not show any appreciable correla-
tion, otherwise they would violate the simple ar-
bitrage hypothesis. In the exchange rates instead
there is a zig-zag behavior (negative correlation)

We now consider the model of the quadratic po-
tential as in Refs. [6, 7]. The eﬀective potential is
easily reconstructed as shown in Fig. 4. We also
show in Fig. 5 the behavior of the absolute price
variations for diﬀerent time steps. The correlation
function for the price and volatility are shown in
Fig. 6 which clariﬁes that, in this case, no simple
correlation is present, nor is there any volatility
clustering eﬀect. This is an interesting result be-
cause it shows that the new method is able to de-
tect hidden forces which have no eﬀect in the usual
correlations of prices or volatility.

Fig. 6. The correlation analysis of price variations shows
no correlations between price diﬀerences and no volatility

is not detectable with the usual statistical indicators.

We now consider some variations to the RW
which depend on P (t) − PM (t). We modify the
probability of a certain step rather than the size of
the step as in Eq.(1). The simplest model is to add a
constant drift, independent on the value of PM (t).
The eﬀective potential corresponding to this case
is simply linear as shown in Fig. 7. One can see
that in this case the point where P (t) − PM (t) = 0
is not a special point and this model appears to be
oversimpliﬁed with respect to the dataset analyzed
up to now [6, 7].

A more interesting model is represented by the
following dynamics for a RW with only up and
down steps:

Fig. 8. Eﬀective potential corresponding to the dynamics
of Eq.(4) with ǫ1 = 0.05 and ǫ2 = 0.10. One can see that
in this case the distribution is asymmetric and it extends
more in the direction for which the instability is stronger.
In this model the eﬀective force only depends on the sign
of P (t) − PM (t) and not on its speciﬁc value. The units of
the potential are deﬁned by Eq.(1).

p(↑) = 1/2 + ǫ1

p(↓) = 1/2 − ǫ1

p(↑) = 1/2 − ǫ2

for P (t) − PM (t) < 0

(

p(↓) = 1/2 + ǫ2 .

This implies a tendency of destabilization (repul-
sion from PM (t)) whose strength is only dependent
on the sign of P (t) − PM (t). In principle the situ-
ation can be asymmetric with ǫ1 6= ǫ2. The poten-
tial analysis for this case leads to a piecewise linear
potential in which the slopes are related to ǫ1 and
ǫ2 (Fig. 8). One can also see that one line extends

Less trivial is the fact that the distributions are
well represented by gaussian curves.

In Fig. 13 we show the same distributions cor-
responding to the probabilistic model of Eq. (4)
for the case of asymmetric attractive and repul-
sive eﬀects. In this case there is a marked deviation
from the gaussian behavior and the case of repul-
sive trend develops two separate peaks. It will be
interesting to check the corresponding distribution
on real stock-prices which we intend to perform in
the future.

Fig. 10. Example of a fractal model distribution of price

The fractal model does not have a speciﬁc dy-
namics but, since it is often considered as to cap-
ture some properties of real prices, we consider of
some interest to study if this model would corre-
spond to some type of eﬀective potential. In Fig.
11 we can see that the eﬀective potential is slightly
attractive. Given the symmetry of the model con-
struction, the asymmetry observed in the eﬀective
potential is probably due to the backward con-
struction of the corresponding moving average.

6. Analysis of the Fluctuations

We now consider the nature of ﬂuctuations from
the moving average by analyzing the probability
for the various mod-
distribution W
els. In Fig. 12 we show the distributions corre-
sponding to the quadratic potential as compared to

P (t)−PM (t)

7. Conclusions and Perspectives

In summary the idea to consider price dynam-
ics as inﬂuenced by an eﬀective force dependent
on the distance of price P (t) from its own moving
average PM (t) represents a new statistical tool to
detect hidden forces in the market. The implemen-
tation of the analysis can be seriously aﬀected by
the eventual presence of positive or negative cor-
relations. However, we have shown by a series of
models and tests, that this new method is able to
explore complex correlations which have no eﬀect
on the usual statistical tools like the correlations
of price variation and the volatility clustering.

The method provides an analysis of the senti-
ment of the market: aggressive for the case of repul-
sive forces and conservative for attractive ones. In
this respect it may represent a bridge between the
ﬁnancial technical analysis and the application of
statistical physics to this ﬁeld. In addition it may
also be useful to analyze the results of the diﬀer-
ent strategies and behaviors which arise in agent
based models.

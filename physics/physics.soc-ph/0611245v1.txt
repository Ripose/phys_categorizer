We review and compare some models of closed economic systems, which have been shown to
describe the main features of the observed wealth distributions. Namely, the models introduced
by Angle in 1983, by Bennati in 1988, by Chakraborti and Chakrabarti, and by Dragulescu and
Yakovenko, in 2000, are considered. An analytical form for the corresponding equilibrium wealth
distribution is proposed for some versions of these models. We suggest how these various models
can be recast into a unique simple reformulation which easily lends itself to further generalizations.

INTRODUCTION

Statistical mechanics methods provide a general theo-
retical framework for tackling problems of very diﬀerent
nature. Methods of statistical mechanics can be fruit-
fully applied not only in physics, chemistry, and biology,
but during the last years statistical methods, often im-
ported directly from physics, have been applied for the
ﬁrst time in a systematic way to various problems of so-
ciophysics and the social sciences [1–7]. While statistical
(mechanical) methods have been applied to ﬁnancial time
series starting already at the beginning of the twentieth
century in the seminal work of Bachelier [8, 9], on the
side of macro-economic modeling quantitative models of
economy have been introduced later, though physics has
always represented a prototype model in economy (e.g.
for Adam Smith) and a uniﬁed approach has been of-
ten advocated (e.g. by Vilfredo Pareto and Ettore Ma-
jorana [10]). A noteworthy diﬃculty met when trying
to achieve this goal was pointed out by Benoit Mandel-
brot [11]: there is a great temptation to consider the ex-
changes of money which occur in economic interaction as
analogous to the exchanges of energy which occur in phys-
ical shocks between gas molecules... Unfortunately the
Pareto distribution decreases much more slowly than any
of the usual laws of physics.... Many stochastic models
are now known which produce a robust power law tail in
the equilibrium wealth distribution, with a Pareto expo-
nent α ≥ 1, consistently with observations. For instance,
multiplicative stochastic processes are the natural choice
for describing the time evolution of individual wealths,
since ﬂuctuations are expected to be proportional to the
wealth itself. Such processes lead to a log-normal dis-
tribution, as already shown in 1931 by Gibrat [12, 13].

Under suitable conditions, the basin of attraction of the
asymptotic distribution of multiplicative non-Gaussian
stochastic processes is the Levy function, presenting a
power law at large values of wealth [11, 14, 15]. How-
ever, in these models the increase of the variance of the
distribution is unbounded and all individual wealths are
treated as independent random variables, while the cor-
responding ﬂuctuations are usually strongly correlated as
a consequence of wealth exchanges between individuals.
Furthermore, a Γ-distribution interpolates actual data at
small and intermediate values better than the log-normal
distribution.

The mentioned issues are avoided by another type of
models, which have been originally introduced in diﬀer-
ent ﬁelds, e.g. in physics on the analogy between wealth
and energy, in the framework of social science, and in
economics. All these models share a certain simplicity
and a similar mathematical structure, and the aim of the
present contribution is to make a short review of them.
In the models under consideration the system is as-
sumed to be made up by N units {i} = {1, 2, . . . , N }.
The state of the system is deﬁned by the corresponding
values {xi > 0} of the quantity x. At every time step
each unit i exchanges the quantity x with another unit j
chosen randomly, while the total value X = Pi xi is kept
constant. The new values x′
j after the exchange
can be written as

i and x′

x′
i = xi − ∆x ,
x′
j = xj + ∆x .

(1)

Here, without loss of generality, the minus (plus) sign has
been chosen in the equation for the i-th (j-th) unit and
the quantity ∆x = ∆x(xi, xj; ǫ) is in general a stochastic
function of a (set of) stochastic variable(s) ǫ and of the
values xi and xj. The form of the function ∆x(xi, xj; ǫ)
deﬁnes the underlying stochastic dynamics, which can be
of a very general type. Here are some concrete examples
of possible interpretations and applications:

• As an example of a physical system, the model can
represent a perfect gas of N molecules which collide

2

with each other exchanging energy: at every colli-
sion, an energy quantity ∆x is transferred from one
particle to the other one, eventually producing the
equilibrium kinetic energy distribution f (x).

• As another mechanical system, a cloud of drops of
masses {xi} can be thought as reaching its station-
ary size distribution f (x) through a set of collisions
between drops, which undergo a mass variation at
each collision.

• On the economics side, economic activity can be
modeled in terms of transfers or exchanges of
wealth x between N economic agents, producing
in the end the stationary wealth distribution.

i.e., Eqs. (1) are invariant by exchanging i and j, implying
that the two units i and j enter an interaction on the
same footing and there is a symmetrical wealth exchange.
We deﬁne then asymmetrical models as those in which the
∆x in Eqs. (1) is not antisymmetrical under exchange of
the i-th and the j-th units,

∆x(xi, xj; ǫ) 6= −∆x(xj, xi; ǫ) .

Rather than through an actual exchange of wealth, a
single interaction between two agents i and j could take
place through a transfer of wealth from i to j or from
j to i, i.e., the total amount of wealth exchanges ∆x is
entirely lost by one agent and gained by the other one.
In this case, during a single encounter,

In this contribution we focus on the latter application.

It is to be noticed that though in actual economic sys-
tems the total wealth is not conserved, closed economy
models should be nevertheless able to provide a good de-
scription on a suﬃciently small time scale. In fact, indi-
vidual wealths ﬂuctuate on a much smaller time scale
than the average wealth and the models studied here
correctly take into account the corresponding correla-
tions [14].

This type of models can be formulated and studied in
the homogeneous or in the more general nonhomogeneous
version and are deﬁned through a set of agent parameters.
The parameter of the generic i-th agent can be deﬁned
as the

saving parameter λi ,

0 ≤ λi < 1 ,

giving the minimum fraction of the xi preserved during
an exchange by the i-th unit or, equivalently, as the

exchange parameter ωi = 1 − λi ,

0 < ωi ≤ 1 ,

as in the model of Angle, representing the maximum frac-
tion of xi entering the exchange process (see below for
details). The parameters {ωi} have an important role in
all these models, since their values directly determine the
time scale of the relaxation process as well as the mean
values {hxii} at equilibrium.

In the homogeneous version, the parameters deﬁning
the proﬁle of all agents have the same value, correspond-
ing to the fact that any agent enters a wealth exchange
process on the same footing. On the other hand, in the
nonhomogeneous version, these parameters may have in
general diﬀerent values for each agent. Homogeneous
models can reproduce the shape of a Γ-distribution ob-
served at small and intermediate values of the wealth
range, while suitably generalized nonhomogeneous ver-
sions can also reproduce under quite general conditions a
power law tail f (x) ∼ 1/xα+1 at larger values of wealth,
with α ≥ 1, as actually found in real wealth distributions.
For the following considerations it is useful to introduce
some deﬁnitions. We deﬁne as symmetrical models those
models in which, for a ﬁxed ǫ, the wealth variation ∆x
in Eqs. (1) satisﬁes the relation

∆x(xi, xj; ǫ) = −∆x(xj , xi; ǫ) ,

∆x ∝ xi

or ∆x ∝ xj ,

and the model will be said to be unidirectional.

Furthermore, it is possible to conceive multi-agent in-
teraction models, in which the evolution law is of the
more general type,

x′
i = xi + ∆xi

i = 1, . . . , N ,

N

X
i=1

∆xi = 0 ,

but for the sake of simplicity they will not be consid-
ered here. Instead we will limit ourselves to some models
deﬁned by the pair-wise interaction law (1).

We begin by reviewing the homogeneous versions of
the various models in Sec. II, suggesting in some cases
an explicit analytical form for the equilibrium distribu-
tions. In particular we consider the model introduced by
Angle, the model of Bennati, the model of Chakraborti
and Chakrabarti, and that introduced by Dragulescu and
Yakovenko. In Sec. III we brieﬂy discuss the nonhomoge-
neous versions of the models and how they can produce a
power law tail in the wealth distribution. In Sec. IV the
models are reformulated in a simple uniﬁed way, which
naturally suggests some possible generalizations. Con-
clusions are drawn in Sec. V.

II. HOMOGENEOUS MODELS

In this section we consider homogeneous models,
in
which all agents are identical to each other and enter
an interaction with the same parameter ω = 1 − λ. Such
models produce a realistic picture of wealth distributions
observed over a large part of the wealth range. In fact
it seems that, among various simple few-parameter func-
tions, the Γ-distribution (or a β-distribution) provides
the best ﬁt to the observed wealth distributions in the
low and intermediate wealth range [16]. The correspond-
ing economic processes must converge fast, since the same
universal shape is observed across diﬀerent cultures and
epochs. This supports the statistical models discussed in
this section, since a Γ-distribution is usually a very good
ﬁt to their equilibrium distribution [17].

A. The model of Angle

The model introduced in 1983 by Angle [16, 18] (A-
model) and its generalizations (see e.g. Refs. [19, 20])
aim at describing how a non-egalitarian wealth distribu-
tion arises from single wealth exchanges between indi-
viduals. From the mathematical point of view they are
asymmetric unidirectional models, in that the exchanged
quantity ∆x is always entirely lost by one of the two
agents. Even if the model resembles the other models
illustrated in this contribution, it has a highly nonlin-
ear dynamics. If the agent who looses wealth is the i-th
agent, then the modulus of the wealth variation |∆x| is
given by a random fraction ǫ of xi (therefore by a linear
function of xi),

|∆x| = ǫ ω xi .

Here the exchange parameter ω ≡ 1 − λ (0 < ω ≤ 1)
represents the maximum fraction of wealth lost, similarly
to the other models (in the ﬁrst model of Refs. [16, 18]
ω = 1). Whether the agent who is going to loose part of
the wealth is the i-th or j-th agent, depends nonlinearly
on xi − xj: it is agent i (j) with probability p0 if xi < xj
(xj < xi) and agent j (i) with probability 1−p0 if xi > xj
(xj > xi). Here p0 is a probability parameter in the
range p0 ∈ (0, 1). The corresponding evolution law can
be rewritten as Eq. (1), in which

∆x = η(xj − xi)ǫ ω xi − [1 − η(xj − xi)]ǫ ω xj .

(2)

Here ǫ and η(x) are random variables. The variable ǫ
is a random number in the interval (0, 1), which can be
either uniform or with a certain probability distribution
g(ǫ), as in the generalizations of the basic A-model [18].
The variable η(x) is a random dichotomous variable re-
sponsible for the unidirectionality of the wealth ﬂow as
it
well as for the nonlinear character of the dynamics:
assumes the value η(x > 0) = +1 with probability p0
(for xi > xj) or the value η(x < 0) = 0 with probability
1 − p0 (for xj < xi). The value η = 1 produces a wealth
transfer from agent i to agent j, while the value η = 0
corresponds to a wealth transfer from j to i (compare the
signs in Eqs. (1)).

A mechanical analogue of the A-model is a model of
drops interaction: from time to time as a consequence of
the mutual interactions or of a collision, a drop originally
of mass xi breaks, remaining with a mass x′
i = xi − ∆x
and producing a fragment of mass ∆x. The fragment is
then absorbed by another drop of mass xj, which in the
end has the mass xj + ∆x, as symbolically depicted in
Fig. 1.

A special case of this model is the symmetrical ex-
change, obtained by setting p0 = 1/2 for the random
dichotomous variable η(x) in Eq. (2). We have studied
this particular problem by numerical simulations, for var-
ious values of λ. The system considered was made up of
N = 105 agents, each agent having a wealth x = 1 in the
initial state. In each simulation a number of transactions

with masses {xi}, which break due to a collision and release

was used, as far as 108, until equilibrium was reached.
The ﬁnal equilibrium distributions were obtained by av-
eraging over 105 diﬀerent runs. The distributions ob-
tained for the model (2) are shown in Fig. 2 and are well
ﬁtted by the Γ-distribution

f (x) = β γn(βx) =

(βx)n−1 exp(−βx) ,

.

(4)

Since λ = 1−ω ∈ [0, 1), the parameter n is a real number
in the interval [1/2, ∞). Notice that from Eqs. (3) and (4)
it follows that for n < 1, i.e., for ω > 3/4 or λ < 1/4, the
Γ-distribution diverges for x → 0, as it is indeed visible
from Fig. 2. A purely exponential energy distribution
f (x) ∝ exp(−βx) is found in this model only in the two-
dimensional case, when D = 2 and n = 1, corresponding
to λ = 1/4 and ω = 3/4.

This model has another very simple mechanical ana-
logue: the quantity D = 2n deﬁned implicitly in Eq. (4)
represents an eﬀective dimension for the system.
It is
easy to check that the distribution γn(βx) = γD/2(βx)
is just the equilibrium distribution at a temperature β−1
for the kinetic energy of a perfect gas in D dimensions
as well as for the potential energy of a D-dimensional
harmonic oscillator or a general harmonic system with D
degrees of freedom. Consistently, the equipartition theo-
rem is automatically fulﬁlled, since

hxi = Dβ−1/2 ,

(5)

according to the basic relation hxi = n β−1 between the
ﬁtting parameters of the Γ-distribution [16].

B. The model of Bennati

The the basic version of the model introduced by Ben-
nati (B-model) is a very simple symmetrical model: units
are assumed to interact by exchanging constant amounts

basic version and do not consider the other ones stud-
ied by Bennati.
If the ﬁnal wealths are positive, i.e.,
i, x′
x′

j ≥ 0, the process is described by Eq. (1) with

∆x = ∆x0 .

i < 0 or x′

If instead x′
j < 0, the interaction does not
take place. As in the A-model, also in the B-model the
change in the wealths is unidirectional. Since the wealth
can vary only in constant amounts ∆x0, the process is
here analogous to a set of particles exchanging energy by
emitting and reabsorbing light quanta of a constant fre-
quency ν0 = ∆x0/~ (rather than to a gas of molecules
which can exchange continuous values of energy by colli-
sion), as illustrated symbolically in Fig. 3. Analytically
the B-model is well described by the exponential equilib-
rium distribution

f (x) = hxi−1 exp(−x/hxi) ,

(6)

and is therefore statistically equivalent to the A-model for
D/2 = n = 1. A diﬀerence respect to the other models
considered in this contribution is that the B-model is
additive (that is, ∆x is independent of x) rather than
multiplicative (∆x ∝ xi).

C. The models of Chakraborti and Chakrabarti

In the

saving propensity model

introduced by
Chakraborti and Chakrabarti [24] (C-model) the general
exchange rule reads

x′
i = λxi + ǫ (1 − λ)(xi + xj ) ,
x′
j = λxj + ¯ǫ (1 − λ)(xi + xj) ,

where ¯ǫ = 1 − ǫ. This rule corresponds to the process
deﬁned by Eq. (1) if

∆x = ω(¯ǫ xi − ǫ xj) = (1 − λ)(¯ǫ xi − ǫ xj) ,

¯ǫ + ǫ = 1 .

At equilibrium, the system is still well described by the
Γ-distribution (3), like in the A-model, but the parameter
n is given by [25, 26]

n(λ) ≡

D(λ)
2

=

1 + 2λ
1 − λ

=

3 − 2ω
ω

,

(10)

i.e., it is just twice the parameter of the symmetrical
A-model for p0 = 1/2. In Fig. 4 numerical results are
compared with the ﬁtting based on Eq. (10). In this case
the probability density is always ﬁnite for x → 0: even
for the highest value of the exchange parameter ω = 1,
or correspondingly for the smallest value of the saving
parameter λ = 0, the distribution does not diverge and
equals the exponential function f (x) = β exp(−βx).

Though there exists a simple relation between the equi-
librium distributions of the symmetrical A-model and the
C-model, i.e., the parameters n of the Γ-distributions are
related as nC(ω) = 2 nA(ω) (compare Eqs. (4) and (10)),
the following important diﬀerences have to be noticed:

• While the A-model

in the C-
model at each encounter wealth ﬂows both from
the i-th to the j-th agent and vice versa.

is unidirectional,

• The C-model is linear, while the unidirectionality
of the A-model implies a nonlinear dependence on
the agent wealths.

n = 1, the equilibrium distribution is found to be well
described by the purely exponential density (6). A note-
worthy mechanical analogue is a gas, in which particles
collide with each other exchanging energy, as illustrated
in Fig. 5 and shown in Ref. [28].

of the form Eq. (3) just as for the A-model, but the value of
n(λ) is given by Eq. (10).

• The random numbers ǫ1 and ǫ2 in the A-model
are independent random numbers, while in the C-
model there is only one random number ǫ extracted
at each encounter, compare the relation (9).

Also the C-model has a mechanical analogue in a har-
monic system with D = 2 n degrees of freedom, or in a
perfect gas in D = 2 n dimensions.

D. The model of Dragulescu and Yakovenko

Here we consider the basic version of the model of
Dragulescu and Yakovenko [27] (D-model) which, sim-
ilarly to the C-model discussed above, describes eco-
nomic activity in terms of symmetrical exchanges be-
tween agents, rather than as unidirectional transfers of
wealth from one agent to another one, as e.g. in the A-
model and in the B-model. The model of Dragulescu and
Yakovenko can be seen as a random reshuﬄing of the to-
tal initial wealth xi + xj of the two units. In fact it is
deﬁned by the exchange law

FIG. 5: The D-model as well as the C-model prescribe a sym-
metrical microscopic interaction between two units. A me-
chanical analogue is a kinetic model of gas in which, during
an elastic collision, two generic particles i and j exchange an
energy ∆x.

The results presented in this section for the symmetri-
cal (p0 = 1/2) A-model, the C-model, and the D-model,
are summarized in the n-column of Table I.

For completeness we brieﬂy recall here also the main
results of nonhomogenous models, i.e., models in which
each agent i is assigned a diﬀerent value of the parameter

(11)

III. NONHOMOGENEOUS MODELS

ωi = 1 − λi. Studies of such models have been both ana-
lytical and numerical [17, 19, 29–34], focusing mainly on
the case with {λi} uniformly distributed in the interval
[0, 1).

The corresponding formulations of the nonhomoge-
neous models are straightforwardly obtained from the
formulas for the homogeneous cases discussed in the pre-
vious sections. This can be done by replacing the generic
term ωxi (or λxi) in the evolution law with ωixi (or λixi),
where the set of parameters {ωi} (or {λi}) is constant in
time and speciﬁes the proﬁles of the agents. For a con-
tinuous distribution of parameter values, the system can
be described by a distribution χ(ω) or φ(λ).

The A-model as well as the C-model, when reformu-
lated with diversiﬁed parameters, lead to an exponential
law at intermediate x-values and to a power law distri-
bution f (x) ∝ 1/x1+α at larger x-values. Numerical sim-
ulations and theoretical considerations suggest that the
power law distribution is quite robust. The Pareto expo-
nent α = 1 is found whenever the limit φ(λ → 1) is a ﬁnite
number. If instead, φ(λ → 1) → 0 as φ(λ) ∼ (1 − λ)α−1,
then the corresponding power law turns out to have an
exponent α > 1. This shows that in general agents with
λi close to 1 play an important role in the appearance of
the power law tail. However, a power law tail can appear
on a ﬁnite range of wealth even when there is an upper
cutoﬀ λmax in the saving parameter distribution [36].

The global wealth distribution f (x) with a Pareto
power law can be resolved as a mixture of the par-
tial wealth probability densities fi(x) with exponential
tail and average wealths of the single agents growing as
hxii ∝ 1/(1 − λi) [34, 35].

IV. REFORMULATION AND
GENERALIZATIONS

Here we suggest a reformulation of the exchange laws
of the models considered above. The idea is to rewrite
the evolution law through a single stochastic propensity
variable ˜λ or, equivalently, through a stochastic exchange
parameter ˜ω = 1 − ˜λ. This formal rearrangement of the
evolution equations has the advantage to maintain their
form very simple, suggesting at the same time further
generalizations. For the sake of generality, we consider
the case of a nonhomogeneous system characterized by
a parameter set {ωi}. The multiplicative models dis-
cussed above (not including the additive B-model) can
be rewritten according to the basic equation (1) with a
wealth exchange term given by

∆x = ˜ωi xi − ˜ωj xj .

(12)

Here ˜ωi (˜ωj) is a stochastic variable representing the ac-
tual percentage of wealth lost by the i-th (j-th) agent
during the current transaction. The variables ˜ωi and ˜ωj
are deﬁned as follows for the various cases:

• In the A-model, the ˜ωi are independent nonlinear

6

(13)

stochastic functions of the agent wealths xi and xj,

˜ωi = η(xj − xi)ǫ ωi ,
˜ωj = η(xi − xj)ǫ ωj ,

where η(x) = 1 with probability p0 for x > 0 and
η(x) = 0 with probability 1 − p0 for x < 0, while ǫ
is a random number with a density g(ǫ).

• For the C-model,

˜ωi = ǫ (1 − λi) ≡ ǫ ωi ,
˜ωj = (1 − ǫ) (1 − λj) ≡ (1 − ǫ) ωj ,

(14)

where ǫ is a uniform random number in (0, 1). The
stochastic variable ˜ωi is a uniform random number
which can assume values in the interval (0, ωi].

• The D-model is reobtained when all ωi → 1.

The various cases are summarized in Table I, assuming
as a reference the formulation given in Eq. (12). The last
column of Table I refers to the homogeneous models and
gives the ﬁtting parameter n of the Γ-distribution. Fur-
ther generalizations can be done by changing the proper-
ties of the stochastic variables ˜ωi, while the basic formu-
lation (12) of the exchange law remains the same. As an
example, one can speculate that every interaction has a
cost and generalize the C-model to investigate the inﬂu-
ence of introducing a lower limit ω′
i on the variation of ˜ωi
(which in the C-model has only an upper limit given by
the parameter ωi ≤ 1). That is, we redeﬁne the stochas-
tic variable ˜ωi as a uniform random number such that

ω′

i < ˜ωi < ωi .

(15)

Equivalently, one can introduce an upper limit λ′
which becomes a uniform random number such that

i on ˜λi,

1 − ωi = λi < ˜λi < λ′

i = 1 − ω′
i .

(16)

We have performed numerical simulations for the ho-
mogeneous case, i.e., with a common lower limit λ′
i =
i ≡ λ′ and a common upper limit λi = 1 − ωi ≡ λ
1 − ω′
for the variable ˜λi. We have obtained equilibrium dis-
tributions which are well ﬁtted through the shape of a
Γ-distribution γn(βx), with β−1 = hxi/n, for all values
of λ and λ′ considered. The dependence of the ﬁtting
parameter n on the exchange parameters λ and λ′ is not
known analytically, however, the results of numerical sim-
ulations are represented graphically in Fig. 6. The ﬁrst
curve from the top represent n(λ) as a function of λ for
λ′ = 1, corresponding to the C-model with ˜λ ∈ (λ, 1].
For this case n(λ) is known to diverge as 1/(1 − λ) for
λ → 1, see Table I. In the other cases, the ﬁrst (dotted
or dashed) part of the curves represents n as a function
of λ for a ﬁxed value of λ′ and stops at λ = λ′ since
by deﬁnition λ < λ′. The remaining (continuous) part
of the curves represents n as a function of λ′ for a ﬁxed
value of λ.

V. CONCLUSIONS

Various statistical many-agent models of closed econ-
omy systems, in which N agents exchange wealth through

7

random pair-wise interactions, were originally introduced
in ﬁelds as diﬀerent as social sciences, economics, and
physics. These models share a similarity in their struc-
ture, which has been used as starting point in the present
paper to suggest a simple uniﬁed reformulation. Such a
reformulation is based on the introduction of a stochastic
variables ˜λ (˜ω) representing the actual fraction of wealth
saved (exchanged) by an agent during a single transac-
tion. It lends itself easily to further generalizations, by
modifying the stochastic properties of the variable ˜λ or
˜ω, while leaving the general evolution law unchanged.

In the case of homogeneous models, with a global value
of the saving parameter λ (or of the exchange parameter
ω), the equilibrium wealth distribution is in most cases
a Γ-distribution f (x) = βγn(βx) of order n, which is
known to represent the equilibrium distribution for a 2n-
dimensional canonical ensemble with a quadratic Hamil-
tonian. The actual diﬀerences between the various mod-
els are in the dependence of the index n on ω = 1 − λ
and are summarized by Table I.

The nonhomogeneous versions of these models, i.e.,
when the agent parameters {ωi = 1−λi} have distributed
values, exhibit a robust power law tail under quite gen-
eral conditions.

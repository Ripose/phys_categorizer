The law of large numbers for completely random
behavior of market participants. Quantum economics

V. P. Maslov

Abstract

In this paper, we brieﬂy discuss a mathematical concept that can be used in

economics.

It has been known since Jacob Bernoulli that averaging in economics is nonlinear and
does not obey the rules of ordinary arithmetics. For example, the average of winning or
losing, say, $100,000 is not equivalent to customary life for a person who is not wealthy,
since losing could mean their becoming homeless and even going to jail, whereas winning
would not raise their living standards high enough to justify the mere risk of losing.

Accumulating 51interest. By pooling their capital, owners can become monopolists
and raise prices. This also corroborates the nonarithmetic nature of addition. Further,
one observes nonlinear addition when buying goods wholesale: the more you buy, the less
you pay per item.

The mathematical problem of nonlinear averaging was attacked by the outstanding
Russian mathematician Kolmogorov, who obtained a general formula for the average. I
supplement his axioms by an additional axiom saying that if a (small) number is added
to each term in the sum, then the average increases by same number.

This unambiguously results in the following rule for the average of two numbers a and
b: (a “+” b)/2 = 1/β log[(2βaa + 2βbb)/2], where β is an unknown parameter and base 2
logarithm is used. For β = 0, one arrives at the conventional linear average. It is easily
seen that β is negative for purchase averaging and positive for sale averaging.

If the operation a ‘+’ b = 1/β log[2βa + 2βb] is taken as addition and the conventional
addition a + b as multiplication, then the commutativity, associativity, and distributivity
laws hold. This arithmetics is possibly used somewhere in the “Kingdom of Distorting
Mirrors.”

In my opinion, this arithmetics is more adequate to a market economy than the con-
ventional, classical arithmetics and permits one, using model examples, to explain stock
price breakout, default, and a number of laws observed in statistical data processing.

In this note, I wish to present an economic eﬀect that proved quite unexpected to
myself. I speak of a statistical sensation that would be nicknamed “fool’s luck” by ordinary
people. Since 2003, studies related to the analysis of operations at London stock exchange
have been evoking quite a response. About ﬁve hundred papers that can be found in the
Internet under the keywords zero intelligence discuss the problem of completely random
behavior of market participants. The point is that traders buying and selling stock have
to take into account so many various factors that they cannot make the right decision
unambiguously, and so the behavior of market participants does not diﬀer from a random
behavior very much. And if it does, the trader usually loses. Here we assume that the
sales volume, the number of participants, the number of nomenclatures of ﬁnancial tools
for each price, and the number of tools are suﬃciently large.

1

Thus what is a random choice?
To make a random choice, one should ﬁrst calculate all possible choices of purchases
or sales and average them. The parameter β can relatively easily be expressed via the
budget restraint (BR) in the ﬁrst case and via the required rate of return (RRR) in the
second case.

Note that possible choices of purchases and sales obey the so-called Bose statistics.
For example, the number of ways to buy nails and bread for 2 cents is as follows: 1) 2
cents for nails; 2) 2 cents for bread; 3) 1 cent for nails and 1 cent for bread. All in all,
there are three ways, since bank notes or coins of the same value are indistinguishable.
(The law that can be stated as “money does not smell”: nothing changes if one note is
exchanged for another.)

How to make a random choice? It suﬃces to number all possible purchases whose price
does not exceed BR and then choose a number randomly, as if throwing dice. Computer
generates random (more precisely, “pseudorandom”) numbers. It turns out that the law
of large numbers holds: given a BR, a vast majority of such random choices gives the
same value for the number of purchases at a given price. This value can be determined
in a very simple manner via the nonlinear average of all possible purchases by a small
variation of the given price. (The number of tools purchased at a given price is equal to
the partial derivative with respect to this price of the nonlinear average over all possible
purchases.) A similar law holds for sellers.

Note that the parameter β < 0 for purchasers can also be determined by equating the
derivative of the nonlinear average with respect to 1/β with the logarithm of the number
of possible purchases whose price does not exceed BR. Accordingly, for sellers (β > 0) the
derivative should be equated with the logarithm of the number of possible sales that give
a proﬁt not less than RRR.

Thus if the behavior of market participants is completely random, then we can ﬁnd
the number of goods purchased by a majority for a given price and even estimate the
fraction constituted by this majority. Conversely, if we cannot do that, then the behavior
of market participants cannot be viewed as random.

If the prices can be varied, then, by equating the amount of goods sold as a function
of RRR with the amount of goods purchased as a function of BR, we can ﬁnd equilibrium
prices.

It follows from an analysis of papers in the “zero intelligence” series that traders who
do not subtilize, i.e., who act at random rather than deliberately, mainly do not lose. It
is not without reason that one speaks of fool’s luck or beginner’s luck: he who gambles
for the ﬁrst time (and hence has not yet been spoiled by calculations) does not lose as a
rule. There is a large body of corroborating statistical evidence. Hence if we assume that
a vast majority of traders have zero intelligence, then the law established by the author
gives a right forecast of free market prices.

Let us discuss a similar situation for consumer goods. Suppose that a customer who
has a certain amount BR of money for buying gifts in advance for a large number of people
enters a gift shop (say, in Mexico) with k shop ﬂoors each of which oﬀers a large variety of
souvenirs for the same price. The consumer does not know the tastes of all acquaintances
whom the gifts are intended for and buys at random. Then the above-mentioned law
applies, and one can rather accurately predict how much money the consumer will spend
at each shop ﬂoor. More precisely, if there are many similar consumers, then a vast
majority of them will spend exactly the amount predicted by this law at each shop ﬂoor.
This is a very simple model, which can be generalized. For example, consider the case
in which the goods are divided into i clusters with close prices within each cluster. Then

2

one determines the (nonlinear) average proﬁt over all goods if Ni goods are sold for these
prices and then the average price for the ith cluster is found. The above-mentioned law
remains valid in this case and determines the amount spent by a customer for a given
cluster of goods.

In this paper, we brieﬂy discuss a mathematical concept that can be used in economics.

1 Nonlinear averaging in the sense of Kolmogorov

A sequence of functions Mn determines the regular type of the average if the following
(Kolmogorov) conditions are satisﬁed:

I. M(x1, x2, . . . , xn) is a continuous and monotone function in each variable. To be

deﬁnite, we assume that M increases in each variable.
II. M(x1, x2, . . . , xn) is a symmetric function1.
III. The average of identical numbers is equal to their common value: M(x, x, . . . , x) =

IV. A group of values can be replaced by their average so that the common average

M(x1, . . . , xm, y1, . . . , yn) = Mn+m(x . . . , x, y, . . . , yn),

x.

does not change:

where x = M(x1, . . . , xn).

takes the form

Theorem 1 (Kolmogorov) Under conditions I–IY, the average M(x1, x2, . . . , xn)

M(x1, x2, . . . , xn) = ψ

ϕ(x1) + ϕ(x2) + . . . + ϕ(xn)
n

,

(1)

where ϕ is a continuous strictly monotone function and ψ is its inverse.

For the proof of the theorem, see [1].

2 The main averaging axiom

It is rather obvious for a stable system that the following axiom must hold.

If the same value ω is added to xk, then their average increases by this value ω.
Obviously, the nonlinear averaging of xi under normal conditions must also increase

by this value. We take this fact as Axiom 5.

This axiom leads to a unique solution in the nonlinear case, i.e., the linear case (the
arithmetic mean) naturally satisﬁes this axiom, as well as a unique (up to the same
constant by which we can multiply all the incomes xi) nonlinear function.

In fact, the incomes xi are calculated in some currency and, in general, must be
multiplied by a quantity β, which is responsible for the purchasing power of this currency,
so that this constant (the parameter β) must a priori be contained in the deﬁnition of the
income. Hence we can state that there exists a unique nonlinear function that satisﬁes
Axiom 5.

The function f (x) has the form

f (x) = C exp(Dx) + B,

(2)

where C, D

= 0 and B are numbers independent of x.

1In our case, the symmetry follows from the Bose statistics for bank notes.

3 Semiring, an example of self-adjoint linear opera-

tors

We consider the semiring generated by nonlinear averaging and the space L2 ranging in
this semiring.

First, we consider a heat equation of the form

Here h is a small parameter, but we do not use its smallness now.
Equation (3) is a linear equation. As is known, this means that if u1 and u2 are its

solutions, then the linear combination

is also its solution. Here λ1 and λ2 are constants.
Now we perform the following change. We set

Everything written here is, of course, trivial, and the people on our planet need not
study new arithmetic operations, because, using a change of the function, one can pass
from Eq. (6) to Eq. (3), which is linear in the usual sense. But it turns out that the
“Kingdom of distorting mirrors” given by this semiring is related to the “capitalistic”
economics.

income obtained by selling N units of goods is equal to E =

The concepts introduced below are based on the notion of nonlinear averaging of

4.1 Psychology of an ordinary depositor. Psychological law of

status quo preservation

We note that losing $100,000 is much heavier in its psychological “cost” than winning
the same sum. This means that an ordinary person prefers to preserve status quo, i.e.,
not to take risk of losing $100,000. Therefore, if a person deposits a certain sum N in
several banks at high interest, he must calculate what sum is suﬃcient for him to live like
a rentier, to preserve status quo, and, accordingly, how to spread the money over several
banks so as not to take any risk and not to lose his status.

This purely psychological fact is the base of our mathematical calculations. We note
that an ordinary depositor can rather easily calculate the sum of income, but it is diﬃcult
for him to evaluate the reliability of a bank proposing high interest rates. Therefore, in
the formulas given below, the free parameter β can be determined in terms of the sum of
income introduced above, and then we obtain graphs showing how the bank deposits ni
depend on the a priori given income.

The problem of calculating the “surviving probability,” which is close to the “status

quo preservation law,” has been discussed by specialists in mathematical economics.

P

If the required rate of return (RRR)

niλi = E is assumed to be an independent
variable, then the nonlinear averaging based on the Kolmogorov axioms and the additional
axiom proposed by the author is unique.

We assume that production runs normally if the producer’s income

than or at least equal to a quantity E1. The consumer cannot spend more that E2 =

∂M
∂εi |θ=θ1

allows us to obtain θ = θ2(H1).

We choose k possible purchase versions at random.
It turns our that, for the majority of these versions, the sum of money spent for buying

goods at price εi, is “almost” equal to

(this is an analog of the law of large numbers; the exact estimates are the same as in the
usual law of large numbers).

A similar statement holds for the seller. The equilibrium prices follows from the

relation

∂M
∂εi |θ=θ1(ε) =

∂ ˜M
∂εi |θ=θ2(ε),
Thus, the “resources–producer–consumer–etc.” vertical line is divided into pairs each of
which contains two new numbers, RRR and BR. The entropy (the Kolmogorov complex-
ity) and the degree of risk are “hidden” in the intermediate calculations. This is how the
usual model of economical equilibrium (the general equilibrium) varies.

i = 1,

, n.

· · ·

The models of dynamical equilibrium (the intertemporal general equilibrium) vary

similarly according to formula (41) given in [3], p. 276.

The price equilibrium condition is determined by the relations

∂M
∂εi |θ=θ1(ε,E1) =

∂tildeM
∂εi

|θ=θ2(ε,E2).

(11)

.

It follows from the “pair” law that the derivative of the average with respect to the
“temperature” θ is the entropy and the derivative with respect to the price is the quantity
of goods. Relation (11) is well known in the linear case. Here we generalize it to the non-
linear case. This generalization allows us to take the Kolmogorov complexity into account,
and hence the entropy, which is one of the most important notions in economics. Its con-
jugate, the temperature, determines the degree of risk, and sometimes, the volatility. But
the variables in the ﬁnal formulas contain only the incomes RRR and the expenditures
BR, which can be calculated easily. Thus, H and θ are “hidden parameters” here.

5 Tunnel canonical operator in economics

The equilibrium prices are determined by the condition that the demand and oﬀer must
be the same for each item of goods and resources. The following pairs can be determined
similarly: ﬂows of goods and services – prices; ﬂows of trade of diﬀerent kinds – salary
rates; ﬂows of raw material resources – rents; interest – loan volume.

The asymptotics of M and ˜M is given by the tunnel canonical operator in the phase

space of pairs.

7

We consider the phase space R2n, where the intensive variables play the role of coor-
dinates and the extensive variables play the role of momenta. In economics, the role of
values of a random variable λi can be played by the prices of the corresponding goods,
and Ni can, for example, be the number of sold goods, i.e., the number of people who
bought goods of this particular type, or the interest paid by the ith bank, etc. Obvi-
ously, the price depends on the demand, i.e., λi(Ni) is a curve in the two-dimensional
phase space. In the two-dimensional phase space, to each point (vector) λi, i = 1, . . . , n,
there corresponds a vector Ni(λ1, . . . , λn), i = 1, . . . , n. In a more general case, this is
an N-dimensional manifold (surface), where the “coordinates” and “momenta” locally
depend on n parameters, and the following condition is satisﬁed: the Lagrange brackets
of the “coordinates” and “momenta” are zero with respect to these parameters. Hence
such a manifold was called a Lagrangian manifold by the author. In other words, the
Nidλi is
form
pdq (p is the momentum and q is
independent of the path and is called an action like
the coordinate) in mechanics.

Nidλi is closed (see the Afterword in [4] and [5]). This means that

P

R

The producer acquires resources and transforms the resources expenditure vector into
the vector of material wealth production. Then the consumer acquires this material
wealth. Thus, the equilibrium prices of resources and of the consumer material wealth
are determined according to the above relations.

R

In addition to such equilibrium prices, there can also be vertical pairs for some types
of material wealth and seller–buyer pairs (i.e., permanent seller – permanent buyer pairs),
and the prices related to these pairs are formed. This is an analog of the Cooper pairs in
quantum statistics.

This construction requires the use of the ultra-secondary quantization method in ab-
stract algebraic form, which could be applied in economics. The “vertical” clusters are
also formed in this theory.

Thus, we have determined the parameter β, and the problem is solved completely.
Example. In what follows, a person who buys stocks will be called a player. Suppose
that there are only two types of stocks, the ﬁrst are conditionally called “cheap” stocks
and the stocks of the second type are said to be “expensive.” We assume that a player
buys a packet of N stocks in which the number of cheap stocks is N1 and the number of
expensive stocks is N2 = N
N1, respectively. A player spends money to buy stocks, and
the number of purchased stocks aﬀects the price of stocks of both types. In particular,
the larger is the number of expensive stocks bought by a player, the less their price will
be. Consequently, in what follows, we assume that the player’s expenditures for a packet
of stocks depend nonlinearly on the number of purchased cheap and expensive stocks. For
example, it depends quadratically as follows:

same price.

the local Mβ at the other points, cannot be used near this point. The local minimum
obtained by computer shows unstable “spreading.” It turns out that the asymptotics near
this point can be expressed in terms of the Airy function of an imaginary argument, and
this fact removes all the problems listed above.

For T > 40, no equilibrium can exist when small changes in purchasing and selling
occur. Therefore, to return to the equilibrium point formed as a result of changes in the
local averaging near another local minimum, the player must change a large amount of
stocks at once (see Fig. 3).

A similar situation occurs when κ = 1 and the player wants to win as much as possible.
Then the points of minima are replaced by the points of maxima between which, in the
case of a quadratic dependence on N1 and N2, there is a minimum. If T varies from zero
to some T0 at which the local maximum disappears, then a jump occurs, which can be
treated as a stock price break-down. In our case, if the player simultaneously and very
fast sells a large amount of stocks of one type and buys a large amount of stocks of a
diﬀerent type, then he can again get to another equilibrium point.

We have considered only the simplest model. In a more complicated economical situa-
tion concerning the interests of a great mass of the population, the people cannot change
their behavior very fast, passing, for example, from the usual consumer basket to a diﬀer-
ent basket and thus changing their mode of life. Then there is no equilibrium (balance)
point in general, and a sharp disbalance leads to general default.

Generalization. In our example, we obtained a one-dimensional curve correspond-
ing to a local minimum of the entropy dependence on the “temperature” in the two-
dimensional S, T -space and considered its projection on the T -axis at the point T0. This
projection is not “good,” and we said that the asymptotics of Mβ in a neighborhood of
this point must be replaced by the Airy function.

What picture appears in the general case where we have two “conjugate” pairs: the
entropy–temperature pair and, for example, the number of people N corresponding to
some average salary εk.

In this case, we consider a four-dimensional (phase) space, where T, ε are the “co-
ordinates” and N, S are the momenta. The surface corresponding to our curve is two-
dimensional and can (locally) be written in parametric form as

T = T (α1, α2),

ε = ε(α1, α2), N = N(α1, α2), S = S(α1, α2),

where α1, α2 are parameters.

Because this surface must be obtained (at least, at the simple points of projection on

the “coordinate” plane) from the asymptotics of sums of the form

Mβ =

),

it must be a Lagrangian manifold (this notion was introduced by the author in [5]). At
the points of “bad projection” on the T, ε-plane, the asymptotics is given by the tunnel
canonical operator [5], and its simpliﬁcation, depending on the form of the surface near
the point of “bad projection,” can be obtained using [6].

These general considerations can help constructing the corresponding model of a given

economical situation if the appropriate statistical data are available.

In the present paper, we show that, under certain natural assumptions,
the average can be calculated only in two ways: as the usual linear average and as the
nonlinear average of the form (16).

We divide the goods of all types into groups with diﬀerent prices. Suppose that the
M, the ith group contains Gi types of

In our statement, each λi is equal to one of ǫj. We denote λ = (λ1, λ2, . . . , λn). By

deﬁnition, we have

Gi = M. Let Ki,j be the total number of units of goods of the

goods is given by the vector

We assume that the sellers have sold at most N units of goods of diﬀerent types. We
consider the problem of predicting the “most expected” structure of goods realized in
the free market, which is necessary for the average income to be at least E1. Thus, the
following inequality must hold:

We introduce the main deﬁnitions. The base 2 logarithm of the number of possible versions
of sale of N units of goods for which the income is no less than E1, i.e., (22) is satisﬁed,
will be called the entropy H(E1, λ, N).

By θ(E1, λ, N) we denote the solution (with respect to θ) of the equation

The solution of this equation exists and is unique. This follows from the monotonicity.
We set

The notions introduced above are of general character and can be used for all possible
versions of the goods distribution. In what follows, we consider a speciﬁc case for which
we ﬁnd the asymptotics of the introduced variables and prove a certain simplest version
of the “law of large numbers” under the following conditions.

We introduce the notation νi = Ni/N and pi(N) = Gi/N for i = 1, . . . , n. We assume
that the variables pi(N) have the limit pi as N
, and this limit is greater than zero
for all i. We also assume that E1 = e1N. Let ρ = N/M be a constant (one can also

The conditions of the theorem contain the assumption that the number of nomencla-
tures of goods with the same price is suﬃciently large. But one can unite a group of
goods with diﬀerent prices and, calculating the nonlinear average of these prices, replace
this group of prices in the statement of the theorem by this nonlinear average price.

We shall write the corresponding formula.
We consider a set of prices λi, where i = 1, . . . , n, and a set of numbers gi equal,
for example, to the number of goods of diﬀerent types but with the same price λi. The
numbers gi are quantities of the order of 1. By Ni we denote the number of goods
purchased at the price λi. Taking into account the fact that gi diﬀerent goods can be
purchased at the price λi, the number of diﬀerent way for buying Ni goods at the price
λi is given by the formula

γi(Ni) =

(Ni + gi −
Ni!(gi −

and the number of diﬀerent ways for buying the set of goods
respectively, equal to

Abstract

We analyze a simple opinion formation model consisting of two parties, A and B, and a group I, of

undecided agents. We assume that the supporters of parties A and B do not interact among them,

but only interact through the group I, and that there is a nonzero probability of a spontaneous

change of opinion (A ⇆ I, B ⇆ I). From the master equation, and via van Kampen’s Ω-expansion

approach, we have obtained the “macroscopic” evolution equation, as well as the Fokker-Planck

equation governing the ﬂuctuations around the deterministic behavior. Within the same approach,

we have also obtained information about the typical relaxation behavior of small perturbations.

INTRODUCTION

The last few years have witnessed a growing interest among theoretical physicists in

complex phenomena in ﬁelds departing from the classical mainstream of physics research.

In particular, the application of statistical physics methods to social phenomena has been

discussed in several reviews [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Among these sociological problems, one that has

attracted much attention was the building (or the lack) of consensus. There are many diﬀer-

ent models that simulate and analyze the dynamics of such processes in opinion formation,

cultural dynamics, etc [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. Even though

in general the models studied in those works are simple ones, most of the results have been

obtained via simulations. However, it is extremely relevant to have some form of analytical

insight.

In this work we analyze a simple opinion formation model, analogous to the one studied

in [21] consisting of two parties, A and B, and an “intermediate” group I, that we call

undecided agents. As in [21], we assume that the supporters of parties A and B do not

interact among them, but only through their interaction with the group I, convincing one

of its members through a Sznajd-like rule similarly to what was discussed in [10], that is

within a mean-ﬁeld treatment. However, we don’t consider that members of I can convince

those of A or B, but instead we assume that there is a nonzero probability of a spontaneous
change of opinion from I to the other two parties and viceversa: I ⇆ A, and I ⇆ B. We

will see that this probability of spontaneous change of opinion (implying the existence of

a social temperature [2, 22, 23]) inhibits the possibility of reaching a consensus. Instead of

consensus, we ﬁnd that each party has some statistical density of supporters, and there is

also a statistical stationary number of undecided (I) agents.

Our aim is to write a master equation for this toy model, and study its behavior via

van Kampen’s Ω-expansion approach [24]. After determining if, in this case, the conditions

for the validity of using such an approach are fulﬁlled, and exploiting it, we could obtain

the macroscopic evolution equations for the density of supporters of A and B parties, as

well as the Fokker-Planck equation governing the ﬂuctuations around such deterministic

or macroscopic behavior. The same approach also oﬀers information about the typical

relaxation behavior of small perturbations around the stationary macroscopic solutions.

The outline of the paper is the following. In the next Section we present the model, and

2

apply van Kampen’s Ω expansion approach in order to obtain the macroscopic equation and

the Fokker-Planck equation governing the ﬂuctuations around the macroscopic behavior.

In Section 3 we analyze the behavior of the ﬂuctuations through the study of their mean

values and correlations, and discuss the relaxation time of small perturbations. In Section

4 we present some typical results and ﬁnally, in Section 5, some general conclusions are

summarized.

II. THE MODEL AND THE APPROACH

A. Description of the model

We consider a system composed of three diﬀerent groups of agents

⊲ supporters of the A party, indicated by NA,

⊲ supporters of the B party, indicated by NB,

⊲ undecided ones, indicated by NI.

The interactions we are going to consider are only between A and I, and B and I. That

means that we do not include direct interactions among A and B. The diﬀerent contributions

that we include are

• spontaneous transitions A → I, occurring with a rate α1 NA;

• spontaneous transitions I → A, occurring with a rate α2 NI;

• spontaneous transitions B → I, occurring with a rate α3 NB;

• spontaneous transitions I → B, occurring with a rate α4 NI;
• convincing rule A + I → 2 A, occurring with rate β1
• convincing rule B + I → 2 B, occurring with rate β2

Ω NANI;
Ω NBNI.

As indicated above, here Ni is the number of agents supporting the party or group “i” (with

i = A, B, I). We have the constraint NA + NB + NI = N, where N is the total number of

agents. Such a constraint implies that, for ﬁxed N, there are only two independent variables

NA and NB. By using this constraint, the rates indicated above associated to processes

involving NI, could be written replacing NI = (N − NA − NB).

With the above indicated interactions and rates, the master equation for the probability

P (NA, NB, t) of having populations NA and NB at time t (due we have had populations N o
A

and N o

B at an initial time to(< t)), may be written as

∂
∂ t

P (NA, NB, t) =

α1(NA + 1)P (NA + 1, NB, t) + α3(NB + 1)P (NA, NB + 1, t)

+ α2(N − NA − NB + 1)P (NA − 1, NB, t)

+ α4(N − NA − NB + 1)P (NA, NB − 1, t)

This is the model master equation to which we will apply van Kampen’s approach [24].

B. Van Kampen’s expansion

In order to apply van Kampen’s approach, as discussed in [24], we identify the large

parameter Ω with N (assuming N ≫ 1); and deﬁne the following separation of the Ni’s into

a macroscopic part of size Ω, and a ﬂuctuational part of size Ω

2 ,

1

and deﬁne the density ρ = N

Ω (in our case ρ = 1). We also deﬁne the “step operators”

NA = ΩΨA(t) + Ω

NB = ΩΨB(t) + Ω

2 ξB(t),

with f (Ni) an arbitrary function. Using the forms indicated in Eqs. (2), in the limit of

Ω ≫ 1, the step operators adopt the diﬀerential form [24]

The following order, that is Ω0, yields the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) governing the

ﬂuctuations around the macroscopic behavior. It is given by

As is well known for this approach [24], the solution of this FPE will have a Gaussian form

III. BEHAVIOR OF FLUCTUATIONS

From the FPE indicated above (Eq.

(8)), it is possible to obtain equations for the

mean value of the ﬂuctuations as well as for the correlations of those ﬂuctuations. For the

ﬂuctuations, hξA(t)i = ηA and hξB(t)i = ηB, we have

A. Reference state: symmetric case

Here we particularize the above indicated equations to the symmetrical case, i.e. the case

when Ψst

A = Ψst

B. Hence, we adopt

and

α1 = α3 = α, α2 = α4 = α′,

β1 = β2 = β.

In such a case, the macroscopic equations (6) and (7) take the form

d

ΨA(t) = −[α + α′ − β]ΨA − βΨ2

A − βΨAΨB − α′ΨB + α′

ΨB(t) = −[α + α′ − β]ΨB − βΨ2

B − βΨAΨB − α′ΨA + α′.

In order to make more explicit the solution of these equations, we work with the auxiliary

variables Σ = ΨA + ΨB and ∆ = ΨA − ΨB, and use ρ = 1. Hence, the last equations

transform now into

In a similar way, we can also simplify the equations for ηA and ηB, calling S(t) = ηA + ηB

Equations (19) and (20) show that, in the asymptotic limit, i.e. for t → ∞, both, S = 0

and D = 0, implying that ηst

A = ηst

B = 0. However, also in the general (non symmetric) case

we expect to ﬁnd ηst

A = ηst
in general we obtain, again for t → ∞, that σst

B = 0. In addition, from Eqs. (21), (22) and (23), it is clear that

As we have seen, in the symmetric case we have Ψst

σA(t) and σB(t) behave in a similar way. And in particular σst

analyze the typical time for return to the stationary situation under small perturbations, we

and this help us to reduce the number of equations for the decay of correlations. Hence, we

B. Beyond the symmetric case

Let us call αo, α′

o and βo to the parameter’s values corresponding to the symmetric case.

We consider now the following cases where we vary the parameters

(24)

(25)

(26)

(27)

(28)

β1 = βo,

β2 = βo + ∆β,

α1 = αo, α3 = αo + ∆α,

α2 = α′

o, α4 = α′

o + ∆α′.

We will vary only one of these parameters, while keeping the rest ﬁxed. In the following

section we present the results (mainly numerical) corresponding to those diﬀerent cases.

IV. RESULTS

As indicated above, the macroscopic equations (Eqs. (6) and (7)) have a unique attractor,

indicating that it is adequate to apply van Kampen’s expansion approach. In this section

we will present some results corresponding to symmetric and asymmetric situations, that

show some typical behavior to be expected from the model and the approximation method.

In what follows, al parameters are measured in arbitrary units.

In Fig. 1 we show the evolution of ΨA(t) and ΨB(t), the macroscopic solutions, indicating

some trajectories towards the attractor: (a) for a symmetric, and (b) an asymmetric case.

FIG. 1: Evolution of the macroscopic solutions (Eqs.(6,7)). Case (a) corresponds to trajectories

towards a symmetric solution (i.e. with Ψst

A = Ψst

B), with parameters α1 = α3 = 1, α2 = α4 = 3,

and β1 = β2 = 2. Case (b) corresponds to trajectories towards an asymmetric solution (i.e. with

Ψst

A 6= Ψst

B), with parameters α1 = 1, α3 = 5, α2 = α4 = 3, and β1 = β2 = 2.

It is worth recalling that ΨA and ΨB are the density of supporters of party A and party

B, respectively. During the evolution towards the attractor, starting from arbitrary initial

conditions, we observe the possibility of a marked initial increase of the macroscopic density

for one of the parties, follow by a marked reduction, or other situations showing only a

decrease of an initial high density. Such cases indicate the need of taking with care the

results of surveys and polls during, say, an electoral process. It is possible that an impressive

initial increase in the support of a party can be followed for an also impressive decay of such

a support.

We remark that, due to the symmetry of the problem, it is equivalent to vary the set of

parameters (α3, α4, β2) or the set (α1, α2, β1). Also worth remarking is That in both panels

of Fig 1 the sum of ΨA and ΨB is always < 1, so verifying that there is always a ﬁnite

fraction of undecided agents.

In Fig. 2 we depict the dependence of the stationary macroscopic solutions on diﬀerent

parameters of the system. On Fig. 2(a) the dependence on α3 is represented. It is apparent
that for α3 < α1, we have Ψst
Clearly, Ψst

parameters α4 and β2, respectively. Also in these cases we observe similar behavior as in

the previous one, when varying the indicated parameters. The parameters α3 or α4 (and

similarly for α1 or α2) correspond to spontaneous changes of opinion, and may be related

to a kind of social temperature [2, 22, 23]. However, also β1 and β2 are aﬀected by such

a temperature. So, the variation of these parameters in Fig. 2 correspond to changes in

the social temperature, changes that could be attributed, in a period of time preceding an

election, to increase in the level of discussions as well as the amount of propaganda.

In Fig. 3 we depict the dependence of the stationary correlation functions for the ﬂuctu-

ations σi (with i = 1, 2, corresponding to the projection of σA,B,AB on the principal axes), on

diﬀerent systems’ parameters. In Fig. 3(a) the dependence on α3 is represented, and simi-

larly in Figs. 3(b) and 3(c), the dependence on the parameters α4 and β2, respectively. We

observe that, as the parameters are varied (that, in the case of α3 and α4, and as indicated

above, could be associated to a variation of the social temperature) a tendency inversion

could arise. This indicates that the dispersion of the probability distribution could change

with a variation of the social temperature. This is again a warning for taking with some

care the results of surveys and polls previous to an electoral process.

α1 = α2 = α3 = 1, and β1 = β2 = 1. (b) on β2, the other parameters are α1 = α2 = α3 = α4 = 1,

Figure 4 shows the stationary (Gaussian) probability distribution (pdf) Π(ξA, ξB)st pro-

jected on the original (NA, NB) plane. We show three cases: on the left a symmetrical case,

the central one corresponds to an asymmetrical situation with a population of N = 100,

and on the right the same asymmetrical situation but with a population of N = 1000. This

last case clearly shows the inﬂuence of the population number in reducing the dispersion

(as the population increases). We can use this pdf in order to estimate the probability pi

(i = A, B), of winning for one or the other party. It corresponds to the volume of the dis-

tribution remaining above, or below, the bisectrix NA/N = NB/N. In the symmetrical case,

as is obvious, we obtain pA = pB = 0.5 (or 50%), while in the asymmetrical case we found

pB = 0.257 (or 25.7%) and pB = 0.015 (or 1.5%) for N = 100 and N = 1000, respectively.

These results indicate that, for an asymmetrical situation like the one indicated here, we

have a non zero probability that the minority party could, due to a ﬂuctuation during the

voting day, win the election. However, in agreement with intuition, as far as N ≫ 1, and

the stationary macroscopic solution departs from the symmetric case, such a probability pi
reduces proportionally to N −1 [25].

solution towards an asymmetric stationary case.

FIG. 4: Stationary, Gaussian, probability distribution Π(ξA, ξB)st projected on the original

(NA, NB) plane. On the let we have a symmetrical case with α1 = α3 = 2, α2 = α4 = 1,

β1 = β2 = 2, and the population is N = 100. The central plot shows an asymmetrical case, with

α1 = 2 and α3 = 2.5, while α2 = α4 = 1, β1 = β2 = 2, and the population is N = 100. On the

right we have the same asymmetrical case as before, but now N = 1000, showing the dispersion’s

reduction of the Gaussian distribution.

(with i = 1, 2) corresponding to the projection of σA,B,AB on the principal axes, while on

the right we show the evolution of the angle between the principal axes and the ﬁgure axes.

The temporal reentrance eﬀect that has been observed in other studies exploiting the van

Kampen’s approach [24, 26] is apparent. This is a new warning, indicating the need to take

with some care the results of surveys and polls during an electoral process.

In Fig. 6 we depict the dependence of the dominant (or relevant) relaxation time, that

is the slowest of the three relaxation times, on diﬀerent parameters of the system. On

the left, we show a symmetrical case where the diﬀerent lines represent the dependence

respect to variation of: α1 = α3 indicated by a continuous line; α2 = α4 indicated by dotted

line; β1 = β2 indicated by dashed line. The strong dependence of the relaxation time on

α = α1 = α3 is apparent (in order to be represented in the same scale, the other two cases

are multiplied by 3 or 10, respectively). This means that changes in the social temperature

that, as discussed before, induce changes in α(= α1 = α3), could signiﬁcatively change the

dominant relaxation time. On the right we show an asymmetrical case where, as before, the

diﬀerent lines represent the dependence respect to variation of: α1, indicated by a continuous

line; α2, indicated by a dotted line; and β1, indicated by dashed line. It is worth remarking

FIG. 5: On the left, we have the time evolution of the macroscopic solutions ΨA(t) and ΨB(t). The

parameter values are α1 = 1, α3 = 5, α2 = α4 = 3, β1 = β2 = 2. The stars indicate the position

where the maxima that appear in the next panel occurs. Central part, time evolution of the

correlation functions σi (with i = 1, 2) corresponding to the projection of σA,B,AB on the principal

that, when all the the parameters (α1, α2 and β1) are equal to 1, we see that the relaxation

time is the same. On the left ﬁgure, this is shown in the inset. In the asymmetrical case,

the behavior is of the same order for the variation of the three parameters. However, the

comment about the eﬀect of changes in the social temperature remain valid.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have studied a simple opinion formation model (that is a toy model ), analogous to

the one studied in [21]. It consists of two parties, A and B, and an intermediate group I,

that we call undecided agents. It was assumed that the supporters of parties A and B do

not interact among them, but only through their interaction with the group I, convincing

its members through a mean-ﬁeld treatment; that members of I are not able to convince

those of A or B, but instead we consider a nonzero probability of a spontaneous change of

opinion from I to the other two parties and viceversa. It is this possibility of spontaneous

change of opinion that inhibits the possibility of reaching a consensus, and yields that each

party has some statistical density of supporters, as well as a statistical stationary number

FIG. 6: Dependence of the dominant relaxation time on diﬀerent system parameters. On the left,

symmetrical case: continuous line varying α1 = α3, dotted line varying α2 = α4, and dashed line

varying β1 = β2. In order to compare all three, the dotted line was multiplied by 3, while the

dashed one by 10. The inset shows, now on the same scale, the crossing of the lines at the point

where all the parameters are equal to 1. On the right, asymmetrical case: continuous line varying

α1, dotted line varying α2, and dashed line varying β1. In all cases, the parameters that remain

constant are all = 1.

of undecided agents.

Starting from the master equation for this toy model, the van Kampen’s Ω-expansion

approach [24] was exploited in order to obtain the macroscopic evolution equations for the

density of supporters of A and B parties, as well as the Fokker-Planck equation governing

the ﬂuctuations around such a macroscopic behavior. Through this same approach infor-

mation about the typical relaxation behavior of small perturbations around the stationary

macroscopic solutions was obtained.

The results indicate that one needs to take with care the results of social surveys and

polls in the months preceding an electoral process. As we have found, it is possible that an

impressive initial increase in the support of a party can be followed for an also impressive

decay of such a support. The dependence of the macroscopic solutions as well as the corre-

lation of the ﬂuctuations on the model parameters, variation in α3, α4 or β2 (that, due to

14

the symmetry of the model are similar to varying α1, α2 or β1) was also analyzed. As the

parameters αi correspond to spontaneous change of opinion, or βi to convincing capacity,

and it is possible to assume that have an “activation-like structure”, we can argue that this

could be related to changes in the social temperature, and that such a temperature could

be varied, for instance, in a period near elections when the level of discussion as well as the

amount of propaganda increases.

We have also analyzed the probability that, due to a ﬂuctuation, the minority party

could win a loose election, and that such a probability behaves inversely to N (the popu-

lation number). Also analyzing the temporal behavior of the ﬂuctuations some “tendency

inversion” indicating that, an initial increase of the dispersion could be reduced as time

elapses was found.

We have also analyzed the relaxation of small perturbations near the stationary state,

and the dependence of the typical relaxation times on the system parameters was obtained.

This could shead some light on the social response to small perturbations like an increase of

propaganda, or dissemination of information about some “negative” aspects of a candidate,

etc. However, such an analysis is only valid near the macroscopic stationary state, but looses

its validity for a very large perturbation. For instance, a situation like the one lived in Spain

during the last elections (the terrorist attack in Madrid on March 11, 2003, just four days

before the election day), clearly was a very large perturbation that cannot be described by

this simpliﬁed approach.

Finally, it is worth to comment on the eﬀect of including a direct interaction between

both parties A and B. As long as the direct interaction parameter remains small, the monos-

tability will persist, and the analysis, with small variations will remain valid. However, as

the interaction parameter overcomes some threshold value, a transition towards a bistability

situation arise, invalidating the exploitation of the van Kampen’s Ω-expansion approach.

[25] It is worth commenting that it is convenient to avoid those patological range of parameters

making that Υ = Ψst

A +Ψst

B falls within a very thin strip near the frontiers of the physical region

(i.e. the region limited by Υ = 1, or Ψst

A = 0, or Ψst

B = 0). In such cases, the tail of ﬂuctuations

falling outside the physical region will be too large invalidating the whole approach. Clearly,

the parameters choosen for Fig. 4 avoid such patological situation, as the ﬂuctuation tails

falling outside the physical region are negligible.

We investigate the dynamics of growth models in terms of dynamical
system theory. We analyse some forms of knowledge and its inﬂuence on
economic growth. We assume that the rate of change of knowledge de-
pends on both the rate of change of physical and human capital. First, we
study model with constant savings. The model with optimised behaviour
of households is also considered. We show that the model where the rate of
change of knowledge depends only on the rate of change of physical capital
can be reduced to the form of the two-dimensional autonomous dynamical
system. All possible evolutional paths and the stability of solutions in the
phase space are discussed in details. We obtain that the rate of growth of
capital, consumption and output are greater in the case of capital depen-
dent rate of change of knowledge.

1. Introduction

In his model Solow [7] introduced capital, labour and ‘knowledge’ as
the most important inputs which are used to produce output. Knowledge
can be everything else apart from capital and labour and can play the role
of technological progress. However, the growth of knowledge was exoge-
nous. There are many attempts to describe how knowledge aﬀects output
[5]. There are diﬀerent ways to include knowledge as an endogenous vari-
able in a model. For example, knowledge can be produced in research and
development sector [6]. Knowledge can also be treated as another kind of
input, human capital, used in production [3].

We propose that the change of physical capital inﬂuences the change of
knowledge. We assume that the rate of knowledge growth is proportional to
the rate of capital growth. It can be interpreted in diﬀerent ways. We can
think that capital has some positive externalities on technological progress.
Another possibility is that some capital is used directly in research and
development, for example, it could be supercomputers, satellites or other
equipment.

In this paper we study the dynamics of the optimal growth model with
such a kind of endogenous technological progress. We compare this model
with the optimal growth model with exogenous knowledge. We ﬁnd how
much the economy with endogenous knowledge grows faster than the econ-
omy with exogenous knowledge for diﬀerent values of model parameters.

2. Capital dependent model of growth of knowledge

We consider the economy where output Y is produced by using physical

capital K, human capital H, labour L, and knowledge A as inputs

Y (t) = F (K(t), H(t), A(t)L(t)).

(1)

This production function has constant returns to scale in K(t), H(t), and
A(t)L(t). Labour and knowledge enter multiplicatively to the production
function, and A(t)L(t) is also called eﬀective labour. We assume that labour
increases in the constant rate n

˙L
L

= n

(2)

where an overdot means the diﬀerentiation with respect to time.

The neoclassical model of economic growth is based on simpliﬁed as-
sumption that knowledge grows with the constant rate. There are some
propositions of relaxing this assumption. We also propose some alternative
modiﬁcation of exponential growth of knowledge. Our idea is to consider the

fens2006

more general assumption by including the capital. We assume that apart
from the exogenous growth of knowledge both physical and human capital
can inﬂuence on the rate of growth of knowledge. We assume that these
processes are additive and proportional to rates of growth of these capitals

or

A = A0egtK µH ν.
For µ = ν = 0 we obtain the constant rate of growth of knowledge. The
interpretation of the above assumption can be following. The physical cap-
ital is necessary in research of scientiﬁc and industrial laboratories.
It is
especially important in contemporary science.

(4)

Let us apply the dynamical systems methods [2] to the model of growth

with capital dependent growth of rate of knowledge.

˙k = (1 − µ)skkαhβ − νshkα+1hβ−1 − [(1 − µ − ν)δ + n + g]k
˙h = (1 − ν)shkαhβ − µskkα−1hβ+1 − [(1 − µ − ν)δ + n + g]h

(5a)

(5b)

System (3) have at least two critical points in ﬁnite domain of phase
space. In the Fig. 1 we choose for presentation δ = 0.007, µ = 0.2, ν = 0.2,
α = 0.35, β = 0.4, n = 0.02, g = 0.04. The critical point located at the
origin is a saddle while the second one is a stable node. For diﬀerent values
of the parameters the node is located on the the line k ∝ h.

The comparison of the phase portraits for µ 6= 0, ν 6= 0 with µ = ν = 0
gives that while they are topologically equivalent the node for the latter
case is located for higher k, h.

2.1. Optimisation in the Model with Endogenous Knowledge

At ﬁrst we avoid to explore the nature of knowledge and take the simplest
assumption that knowledge has the exogenous character and grows in the
constant rate g,

˙A
A

= g.

(6)

The capital accumulation comes from output which is not consumed.

Taking into account the capital depreciation δ, capital change is given by
˙K = F (K(t), A(t)L(t)) − C(t) − δK(t).

(7)

It is convenient to use the variables in units of eﬀective labour AL (denoted
in small letters). In this case we obtain

˙k = f (k(t)) − c − (g + n + δ)k(t).

In the original Solow model the savings are a ﬁxed share of product.
However, we can allow the households to choose between saving and con-
sumption in their lifetime [4]. It means that the inﬁnitely living households

where ρ is a discount rate.

To solve the maximisation problem we use the Pontryagin Maximum
Principle [1]. As the result we obtain the system of two diﬀerential equations

˙k = kα − c − (δ + g + n)k

˙c =

(αkα−1 − δ − g − n − ρ).

To obtain this system we assume the Cobb-Douglas production function

which is characterised by the constant elasticity of substitution between
consumption in any two moments of time.

Let us consider the dynamics of system (8). For simpliﬁcation we put

b1 = δ + g + n and ﬁnd three critical points:
the unstable node

k1 = c1 = 0,

Two ﬁrst points have no economic concern because they represent economies
without consumption. Only the third critical point, the saddle, is relevant
in our discussion. Households choose such a level of consumption which is
optimal for a given amount of capital. And it always lies on one of two
trajectories moving to the saddle point. Once the economy reach the saddle
point it enters the balanced growth path where all quantities per a unit of
eﬀective labour are constant. However, capital, consumption, and output
as well as their counterparts per capita (per unit of labour alone) increase
in time.

The phase portrait of this system is shown on Fig. 2. The bold lines

denote two trajectories which lead to the saddle.

Let us return now to the endogenous technological progress. However,
we consider that only the rate of growth of physical capital has inﬂuence on
knowledge. Then equation (3) assumes the form

(15)

We assume that some part of technological progress has the exogenous char-
acter. There is also the additional term which describes the inﬂuence of
change in capital stock on the knowledge growth. The proportionality pa-
rameter µ belongs to [0, 1). For µ = 0 we have the model with the exogenous

knowledge analysed in the previous section. This additional component
could be interpreted as the capital equipment used in research and develop-
ment.

Assuming the form of the production function and the utility function
as in the previous section, the optimisation procedure gives us the following
two-dimensional dynamical system

˙k = (1 − µ)kα − (1 − µ)c − [(1 − µ)δ + g + n]k

[α(1 − µ)kα−1 − (1 − µ)δ − g − n − ρ].

When we put µ = 0 we obtain system (10). We use this feature to compare
the dynamics of system (16) with system (10).

For simpliﬁcation we denote b2 = (1 − µ)δ + g + n. System (16) has three

critical points:

The dynamics of system (16) is presented on Fig. 3. Comparing with Fig. 2
we can see that both phase portraits are topologically equivalent. The
systems are structurally stable.

Two nodes represent unrealistic economies with zero level consumption.
The households choose the optimal levels of consumption for given capi-
tal stock. These choices forms two trajectories which approach the saddle
solution. When the economy converges to the saddle point it reaches the

balanced growth path. Capital, consumption, and output per unit of eﬀec-
tive labour are constant. The dynamics of capital, consumption, output and
capital, consumption, output per a unit of labour depend on the parameters
g, n, and µ.

Table 1 presents the rates of change of capital, consumption, output as

well as their per capita counterparts in both considered models.

We can compare the rate of growth of capital, consumption, and output
in the models with endogenous and exogenous knowledge. The ratio of rates
of growth for capital, consumption, and output is

where X means K, C, and Y . The ratio of rates of growth of capital,
consumption, output in these two models depends only on the parameter
µ. The rate of growth of all the three variables is greater in the presence of
endogenous knowledge. Figure 4 shows how many times the rate of growth
in the model with endogenous knowledge is greater than in the model with
exogenous knowledge for diﬀerent values of µ. For example, for µ = 0.2
the rate of growth is 25% higher, and for µ = 0.5 the rate of growth is 2
times higher, in the model with endogenous technological progress than in
the model model with exogenous technological progress.

We can also compare the rates of growth of per capita quantities in the
models with endogenous and exogenous technological progress. The ratio
of rates of growth is

The ratio of rates of growth of capital, consumption, output per unit of
labour in these two models depends both on the parameter µ and g. Fig. 5

Fig. 4. The dependence of ratio of rates of growth of capital, consumption, output
in the models with endogenous and exogenous knowledge on the parameter µ

presents the ratio of rates of growth with respect to the parameter µ. For
example assuming the same values of parameters g and n we can ﬁnd that
for µ = 1/3 the rate of growth is 2 times higher, and for µ = 2/3 the rate
of growth is 5 times higher, in the model with endogenous technological
progress than in the model model with exogenous technological progress.
When g > n (g < n) the ratio is lower (higher) for a given µ.

2.2. Conclusions

We investigate the dynamics of growth models in terms of dynamical
system theory. We analyse some forms of knowledge and its inﬂuence on
economic growth. We assume that the rate of change of knowledge depends
on both the rate of change of physical and human capital. First, we study
model with constant savings. The model with optimised behaviour of house-
holds is also considered. We show that the model where the rate of change
of knowledge depends only on the rate of change of physical capital can be

reduced to the form of the two-dimensional autonomous dynamical system.
All possible evolutional paths and the stability of solutions in the phase
space are discussed in details. We obtain that the rate of growth of capital,
consumption and output are greater in the case of capital dependent rate
of change of knowledge.

Our proposition of parameterisation of knowledge seems to be a uniﬁ-
cation of exogenous and endogenous factors. If we consider three diﬀerent
cases of endogenous (g = 0, and µ 6= 0 or ν 6= 0) exogenous (g 6= 0, and
µ = ν = 0) and mixed (g 6= 0, and µ 6= 0 or ν 6= 0), we ﬁnd that the qualita-
tive dynamics is the same for reasonable values of the rest parameters of the
model. The only observable diﬀerence is diﬀerent values of rates of change
of the phase variables at the critical point. In other words the endogenous
factors give additional contribution to the rate of change of the variables.

We presented the modiﬁcation of the Ramsey model of optimal economic

growth where knowledge growth depends on the rate of growth of physical
capital. We compare this model with the optimal growth model with the
constant rate of growth of knowledge.

We reduced the growth model with physical capital dependence of knowl-
edge to two-dimensional dynamical system and investigated its solutions
using the qualitative methods of dynamical systems. We presented the dy-
namics of the models on the phase portraits.

We calculated the rates of growth of capital, consumption, and out-
put as well as their counterparts per capita. We compared these rates for
both models and found how many times faster the model variables grows in
the model with endogenous knowledge than in the model with exogenous
knowledge.

It can be interpreted that physical capital growth add to the rate the
knowledge growth some additional impact which makes the physical capital,
consumption and output to grow faster.

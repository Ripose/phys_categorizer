In this paper, a susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model with the same infectivity, where
each node is assigned with the identical capability of active contacts, A, at each time step, is
presented. We ﬁnd that on scale-free networks, the density of the infected nodes shows the existence
of threshold, whose value equals 1/A, both demonstrated by analytical method and simulation
results. Then, we ﬁnd that the infected population grows in an exponential form and follows
hierarchical dynamics, indicating that once the highly connected hubs are reached, the infection
pervades almost the whole network in a progressive cascade.
In addition, the eﬀects of random,
proportional, and targeted immunization for this model are investigated. The present results could
be of practical importance in the setup of dynamic control strategies.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Epidemic, one of the most important issues related to
our real lives, such as computer virus on Internet [1] and
Email networks [2], or HIV on sexual contact networks
[3], attracts a lot of attention for a long time. Among all
the models on the process of the epidemic, susceptible-
infected (SI) [4], susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS)
[5, 6], and susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) [7, 8], are
always the focus as the convenient way to describe the
fundamental mechanism. After some classical conclu-
sions have been achieved on regular networks and random
ones [7], recent studies on small-world (SW) networks
[9] and scale-free (SF) networks [10] introduce fresh air
into the old models with diﬀerent eyes, denoting some
realistic prospects which have never been explored yet.
The conclusions are supported by a large amount of ev-
idences showing that many real-life networks have the
SF property [11, 12, 13], such as Internet, World-Wide-
Web, Friendship and so on. What’s more, in the actual
study of the epidemic behavior on SF networks, Pastor-
Satorras and Vespignani [5, 6] found a striking result that
the critical threshold vanishes when N tends to inﬁnite.
Moreover, it is also able to explain why some diseases
are able to survive for a long time with very low infec-
tion rate.

In this paper, we focus on SIS model. Although it has
achieved a big success, the standard SIS style might con-
tain some unexpected assumption while being introduced
to the SF networks directly, that is, common assumption
in all the aforementioned works is that each node’s poten-
tial infection-activity (infectivity), measured by its pos-
sibly maximal contribution to the propagation process
within one time step, is strictly equal to its degree. As
a result, in the SF networks the nodes with large degree,
called hubs [11, 12, 13], will take the greater possession

∗Electronic address: bhwang@ustc.edu.cn

of the infectivity, so called super-spreader [14, 15]. This
assumption may conceal some underlying and useful in-
formation thus fail to mimic some cases in the real world.
The ﬁrst example is that, in most of the existing peer-to-
peer distributed systems, although their long-term com-
municating connectivity shows the scale-free characteris-
tic [16], all peers have identical capabilities and respon-
sibilities to communicate at a short term, such as the
Gnutella networks [17]. Second, in sexual contact net-
works [18], even the hub node has many acquaintances;
he/she has limited capability to contact with others dur-
ing limited periods [19]. Third, the referral of a product
to potential consumers costs money and time in network
marketing processes (e.g. a salesman has to make phone
calls to persuade his social surrounding to buy the prod-
uct). Therefore, the salesman will not make referrals to
all his acquaintances [20]. The last one, in some email
service systems, such as the Gmail system schemed out
by Google [21], the clients are assigned by limited capa-
bility to invite others to become Google-user only after
invited by an E-mail from the Google user. Similar phe-
nomena are common in our daily lives. Consequently,
diﬀerent styles of the practical lives are thirst for research
on it and that may delight us something interesting which
could oﬀer the direction in the real lives.

II. THE PRESENT MODEL

In the epidemic contact network, each node presents
an individual and each link is connected along that in-
fections can spread to other individuals. Each individual
can be in two discrete states, whether susceptible (S)
or infected (I). At each time step, the susceptible node
which is connected to the infected one will be infected
with rate β. Meanwhile, infected nodes will be cured
with rate δ to be again susceptible, deﬁning the eﬀec-
tive spreading rate λ = β/δ. Without losing generality,
we set δ = 1. Individuals run stochastically through the
cycle susceptible-infected-susceptible, which is also the

works, where P (k′|k) = k′P (k′)/hki, the rate equation

respectively. Then

In the standard SIS model, each individual will contact
all its neighbors once at each time step, and therefore the
infectivity of each node is equal to its degree. However,
in the present model, we assume that every individual
has the same infectivity A. That is to say, at each time
step, each infected individual will generate A contacts
where A is a constant. Multiple contacts to one neigh-
bor are allowed, and contacts the infected ones, although
without any eﬀect on the epidemic dynamics, are also
counted. In this paper, we operate the spreading process
for 2000 steps each once, with half nodes infected ran-
domly initially, and calculate the average over the last
1000 steps as the average density of infected nodes in the
stable state (In the following, we denote it by the symbol
ρ). All of our simulation results are obtained from aver-
aging over 100 independent runs for each of 300 diﬀerent
realizations.

III. SPREADING BEHAVIOR

We ﬁrst focus on the spreading behaviors. Let Ik(t) de-
note the fraction of vertices of degree k that are infected
at time t. Then using the mean-ﬁeld approximation, the
rate equation for the partial densities Ik(t) in a network
characterized by a degree distribution P (k) can be writ-
ten as:

∂tIk(t) = −Ik(t) + λk[1 − Ik(t)] X

∂tρk = 0,

ρk =

where ρ = Pk P (k)ρk is the infected density at the net-
work level in the steady stage. Then, one obtains

ρ =

To the end, for the critical point where ρ ∼ 0, we get

below which the epidemic prevalence is null, and above
which it attains a ﬁnite value. The previous works about
epidemic spreading in SF networks present us with com-
pletely new epidemic propagation scenarios that a highly
heterogeneous structure will lead to the absence of any
epidemic threshold [22], while now, in the present model,
it is 1/A instead. Furthermore, we can also ﬁnd that the
larger of identical infectivity A, the higher of ρ for the
same λ from Fig. 1.

From the analytical result of the threshold value, λc =
1/A, we can also acquire that the critical behavior is in-
dependent of the topology of networks which are valid
for the mean-ﬁeld approximation [23], just depends on
the dynamical parameter A. To demonstrate this propo-
sition, we implement the present model on various net-
works: random and BA networks, diﬀerent values of the
exponents γ of the conﬁguration model [24, 25] and m
(m = hki/2) of BA networks respectively. Revealed from
Fig. 2(a), Fig. 2(b) and Fig. 2(c), the positions of critical
point are the same, which strongly support the previous
result. Furthermore, there is no distinct ﬁnite-size eﬀect
as shown in Fig. 3. In the original SIS model, the node’s
infectivity relies strictly on its degree k and the threshold
λc = hki/hk2i. Since the variance of degrees gets diver-
gent with the increase of N , the epidemic propagation on
scale-free networks has an obvious size eﬀect. However,

based on the networks of size N = 2000, and we set A = 2.

in the present new model, the infected node is just able
to contact the same number of neighbors, A, rather than
it degree, k. Thus the threshold value and the infected
density beyond the threshold are both independent of the
size N .

IV. TIME BEHAVIOR

For further understanding the epidemic dynamics of
the proposed model, we study the time behavior of the
epidemic propagation. First of all, manipulating the op-
erator Pk P (k) on both sides of Eq. 3, and neglecting
terms of order O(I 2), we obtain,

∂tI(t) = −I(t) + λAI(t).

Then the evolution behavior of I(t) is:

I(t) ∼ ect,

where c ∝ (λA − 1).

In Fig.

4, we report the simulation results of the
present model for diﬀerent spreading rates ranging from
0.7 to 0.9. The rescaled curves I(t)/I(t)max (Fig. 4(b))
can be ﬁtted by a straight line in single-log plot for small
t, which strongly supports the analytical results. Fur-
thermore, a more precise characterization of the epidemic
diﬀusion through the network can be achieved by study-
ing some convenient quantities in numerical spreading
experiments on BA networks. First, we measure the av-
erage degree of newly infected nodes at time t,

hkinf (t)i = P kkIk(t)

.

I(t)

Then, we present the inverse participation ratio Y2(t) [26]
to indicate the detailed information on the infection prop-
agation. First we deﬁne the weight of recovered individ-
uals in each class degree k by wk(t) = Ik(t)/I(t). The
quantity Y2(t) is then deﬁned as:

k(t).

From the equation, we can acquire:

of size N = 2000, hki = 6, and A = 2.

classes; on the contrary, if Y2 is larger relatively then the
infection is localized on some speciﬁc degree classes.

In Fig. 5, we plot these quantities for BA networks
as a function of the time t and ﬁnd a hierarchical dy-
namics. We can ﬁnd that all of the curves show an ini-
tial plateau, which denotes that the infection takes con-
trol of the large degree vertices ﬁrstly. Once the highly
connected hubs are reached, the infection pervades al-
most the whole network via a hierarchical cascade across
smaller degree classes. Thus, hkinf (t)i decreases to the
next plateau, which approximates hki = 2m. Moreover,
as also inferred from Fig. 5, the time scale of curves is
proportional to A and independent of m. However, the
curve Y2(t) does not show one obvious concave like the
previous similar conclusions of the other epidemic spread-
ing models [4, 27]. Namely, the infection will not local-
ized one special part of the network such as the smallest
degree ones, which results from that SIS model does not
have an ultimate state such as the “recovered” state of

susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model, and the all
nodes may be infected more than one time even before
the whole spreading comes to the steady stage.

V.

IMMUNIZATION

Immunity research [28], relating to the people’s strate-
gies to struggle with the disease epidemics and so on,
shows great importance and necessities in actual prac-
tice. Since the current model, which represents some real
networks more accurately, shows diﬀerent character with
the standard one, the immunity on this model acquired
to be discussed detailed. As we know, immune nodes can-
not become infected and, therefore, do not transmit the
infection to their neighbors. The simplest immunization
strategy one can consider consists of the random intro-
duction of immune individuals in the population [29, 30].

Next, proportional immunization, a straightforward way
to reintroduce an intrinsic immunization threshold in het-
erogeneous networks consists in using diﬀerent fractions
of immunized individuals according to their connectiv-
ity. Then, as shown by Fig. 5, the epidemic spreading
of the present SIS model also takes on the hierarchical
phenomenon. Accordingly, targeted immunization [31],
as a method of selective damage, in which we progres-
sively immunize the most highly connected nodes, i.e.,
the ones more likely to spread the disease, will be the
most eﬀective.

In Fig. 6, we analyze the stationary properties of the
density of infected nodes ρg (the infection prevalence) as
diﬀerent values of the immunization g for the three kinds
of immunization strategies on random and BA networks.
From the simulation results, we can ﬁnd that the ran-
dom, proportional, targeted immunization thresholds of
random networks are gc ≃ 0.36 (a), 0.34 (b), 0.24 (c),
and them of BA networks are gc ≃ 0.36 (a), 0.16 (b),
0.07 (c) respectively. Therefore, the ﬁrst we can easily
infer is that the eﬀect of the targeted immunization is
the best while proportional one is next and random one
is the worst for both kinds of networks. Second, tar-
geted and proportional ones are less eﬀective to random
networks than BA networks which results from the lim-
ited heterogeneity. Especially, targeted one produces an
arresting increase of the network tolerance to infections
at the price of a tiny fraction of immune individuals in
BA networks. However, evidently diﬀerent from the pro-
portional and targeted one, the random immunization
threshold is the same for SF and random networks. Ac-
tually, in random immunization, for a ﬁxed spreading
rate λ, the relevant control parameter is the immunity g,
deﬁned as the fraction of immune nodes present in the
network. The immunization is implemented by randomly
selecting and immunizing gN nodes on a network of ﬁxed
size N . At the mean-ﬁeld level, the presence of uniform
immunity will eﬀectively reduce the spreading rate λ by
a factor (1 − g). By using Eq.
(8) we have that the
immunization threshold is given by

As shown by Fig. 6(a), the simulated result (gc ≃ 0.36)
corresponds with the analytical result (gc = 0.375)
well. Furthermore, the random immunization threshold
of standard SIS model is given by gc = 1−hki/λhk2i [28].
Namely, we will have that gc(N ) → 1 in the thermody-
namic limit N → ∞. However, denoted by Eq. 13, the
random immunization is eﬀective to some extent for the
present model even for larger N .

For further understanding the eﬀect of the three kinds
of immunization schemes of the present SIS model, we
can study the time behavior of them. Simulations are
performed at a ﬁxed spreading rate λ = 0.8, and the
immunization g = 0.01. Denoted by Fig. 7, the tar-
geted immunization needs the longest time to come to
the steady stage, the proportional one is next and the

random one needs the shortest time.

VI. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION

In this paper, we investigate the behaviors of SIS epi-
demics with the identical infection A. By comparing the

ent values of A with the standard one on BA networks,
we ﬁnd the existence of critical point and lower density
of the infected. Then, we provide the analytical result
of the threshold value 1/A, which correspond with nu-
merical simulation well. Therefore, we acquire that the
critical behavior is independent of the topology of under-
lying networks, just depends on the dynamical parameter
A and the whole spreading process does not have distinct
ﬁnite-size eﬀect. Then, we implement the model in SF
networks and ﬁnd that the infected population grows in
an exponential form, and it follows a hierarchical dynam-
ics. In addition, the time scale is also independent of the
underlying topology.

The last but not the least, the research results of ran-
dom, proportional, and targeted immunization are pre-
sented. We ﬁnd that successful immunization strategies
can be developed only by taking into account the inhomo-
geneous connectivity properties. In particular, targeted
immunization schemes, based on the nodes’ connectivity
hierarchy, lower the network’s vulnerability to epidemic
attacks especially for the SF networks. In addition, we
ﬁnd that the targeted immunization needs the longest
time to come to the steady stage, and the random one
needs the shortest time.

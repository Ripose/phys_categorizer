We investigate the planar maximally ﬁltered graphs of the portfolio of the 300 most capitalized
stocks traded at the New York Stock Exchange during the time period 2001-2003. Topological
properties such as the average length of shortest paths, the betweenness and the degree are investi-
gated on diﬀerent planar maximally ﬁltered graphs generated by sampling the returns at diﬀerent
time horizons ranging from 5 min up to one trading day. This investigation conﬁrms that the se-
lected stocks compose a hierarchical system progressively structuring as the sampling time horizon
increases. Finally, a cluster formation, associated to economic sectors, is quantitatively investigated.

I.

INTRODUCTION

sub-graph.

The study of networks is currently a hot topic of re-
search and the topological properties of several graphs
describing physical and social systems have been exten-
sively investigated. Early examples are the World Wide
Web [1], correlation based networks in ﬁnance [2], Inter-
net [3, 4, 5, 6], and social networks [7, 8]. Other examples
include food webs [9], scientiﬁc citations [10] and sexual
contacts among individuals [11]. In these systems, it re-
sults that the network of links between elements has pe-
culiar topological properties that diﬀer from the ones of
regular or random graph [12, 13, 14]. The challenge is to
uncover whether there is a relation between the particu-
lar properties of such networks and the special properties
of these complex systems.

In the present study we are considering correlation
based networks obtained by analyzing the price dynam-
ics of a set of stocks simultaneously traded in a ﬁnancial
market. This approach generates networks starting from
a set of time series. Speciﬁcally, from a set of n time se-
ries one can calculate the correlation coeﬃcient between
any pair of variables. Each pair of nodes of the net-
work can be thought to be connected by an arc with a
weight related to the correlation coeﬃcient between the
two time series. Such a network is therefore completely
connected. By introducing a suitable ﬁltration of the
network one can remove the less relevant information by
disconnecting some, usually weakly connected elements.
In fact, it is known that the ﬁniteness of time series and
the fat-tail distributions of the ﬂuctuations can introduce
spurious correlation. There are several possible ways of
ﬁltering the correlation matrix and the associated net-
work. We focus on the Planar Maximally Filtered Graph
(PMFG) [15, 16] which is a topological generalization
of the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) [2]. MSTs are
particular types of graphs that connect all the vertices
through the most correlated link without forming any
loop. Conversely, the PMFGs are networks containing
all the most correlated links which can be kept under
the constraint of being representable on a plane without
any edge-crossing (planar graph). It has been shown in
Ref.[15] that the PMFG always contains the MST as a

The presence of a high degree of cross-correlation be-
tween the synchronous time evolution of a set of eq-
uity returns is a well known empirical fact observed in
ﬁnancial markets [17, 18, 19]. For a time horizon of
one trading day correlation coeﬃcient as high as 0.7
can be observed for some pair of equity returns belong-
ing to the same economic sector. The study of cross-
correlation of a set of ﬁnancial equities has practical im-
portance since it can improve the ability to model com-
posed ﬁnancial entities such as, for example, stock port-
folios. There are diﬀerent approaches to address this
problem. The most common one is the principal com-
ponent analysis of the correlation matrix of the data
[20]. An investigation of the properties of the corre-
lation matrix has been performed by physicists by us-
ing the perspective and theoretical results of the ran-
dom matrix theory [21, 22]. As mentioned above, an-
other approach is the correlation based clustering anal-
ysis which allows to obtain clusters of stocks starting
from the time series of price returns. Diﬀerent al-
gorithms exist to perform cluster analysis in ﬁnance
[2, 15, 16, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35].
The eﬀectiveness of single linkage and average linkage
clustering in portfolio optimization has been recently in-
vestigated in Ref. [36].

In this paper we discuss how the correlation structure
of a portfolio of stocks changes when the time horizon of
return time series, which are used to compute the cor-
relation coeﬃcient, is progressively decreased to a short
intraday time scale. It is known since 1979 that the de-
gree of cross-correlation diminishes by reducing the time
horizon used to compute stock returns [37]. This phe-
nomenon is sometime addressed as “Epps eﬀect”. The
existence of this phenomenon motivates us to investigate
the nature and the properties of the network associated
to a given ﬁnancial portfolio as a function of the time
horizon used to record stock return time series.

Ref.

[26] investigated for the ﬁrst time correlation
based networks obtained from time series sampled at
diﬀerent time horizon and including high-frequency in-
traday data. By investigating the topological properties
of the MST obtained at diﬀerent time horizons, it was

shown that a clear modiﬁcation of the hierarchical orga-
nization of the set of stocks is detected when one changes
the time horizon. The investigation was performed with
the set of 100 US highly capitalized stock returns when
the time horizon of price returns varied from d = 23400
s to d/20, where d is equal to one trading day at the
New York Stock Exchange. The shortest time horizon
was chosen in order to statistically ensure that for each
stock at least 1 transaction occurs during ∆t.

The ‘Epps eﬀect’ predicts that the pair correlation de-
creases by decreasing the time horizon ∆t. In Ref. [26],
authors show that this eﬀect is indeed clearly detected.
Ref.
[26] has also shown that the decrease of the corre-
lation between pairs of stocks also aﬀects the nature of
the hierarchical organization of stocks. Speciﬁcally, Ref.
[26] shows that the topology of the network evolves from
a star like structure characterizing the network obtained
for the shortest sampling time horizon to a much more
structured network for the longest time horizon (in the
speciﬁc case one trading day).

In the present study we investigate the topological
properties of the PMFG. We show that the PMFG is able
to retrieve all the results obtained for the MST and it
provides a more eﬀective methodology to track the topo-
logical changes of the correlation based graph.

The paper is organized as follows: Sect. II discusses
the methods used to ﬁlter out information from data,
whereas Sect. III and Sect. IV focus on the data analysis.
Finally in Sect. V we draw our conclusions.

II. CORRELATION BASED CLUSTERING

Let us here summarize the construction procedures for
the MST and PMFG graphs. The MST is a graph which
contains no loops and it connects all the n nodes with
the shortest n − 1 links. The selection of these n − 1 links
is done according to some classic algorithm [38] and can
be summarized as follows: (i) construct an ordered list
of pair of stocks Lord, by ranking all the possible pairs
according to their correlation coeﬃcient ρij or distance
dij = p2(1 − ρij ). The ﬁrst pair of Lord has the highest
correlation or the shortest distance; (ii) the ﬁrst pair of
Lord gives the ﬁrst two elements of the MST and the link
between them; (iii) the construction of the MST contin-
ues by analyzing the list Lord. At each successive stage,
a pair of elements is selected from Lord and the corre-
sponding link is added to the MST if and only if no loops
are generated in the graph after the link insertion.

In Ref.

[39] the procedure brieﬂy sketched above has
been shown to provide a MST which is associated to the
hierarchical tree of the Single Linkage Clustering Algo-
rithm. In this procedure, at each step, when two elements
or one element and a cluster or two clusters p and q merge
into a wider single cluster t, the distance dtr between the
new cluster t and any cluster r is recursively determined
by dtr = min{dpr, dqr}. By applying iteratively this pro-
cedure, n − 1 of the n(n − 1)/2 distinct elements of the

2

original correlation coeﬃcient matrix are selected.

The PMFG has been introduced in two recent papers
[15, 16]. The basic idea is to obtain a graph that retains
the same hierarchical properties of the MST, but which
is allowing a greater number of links and more complex
topological structures than the MST, such as loops
and cliques. Such a graph is obtained by relaxing the
topological constraint of the described MST construction
protocol according to which no loops are allowed in a
tree. Speciﬁcally, in the PMFG a link can be included
in the graph if and only if the graph with the new link
included is still planar. A graph is planar if and only if
it can be drawn on a plane (inﬁnite in principle) without
edge crossings [40].

The ﬁrst diﬀerence between MST and PMFG is about
the number of links, which is n − 1 in the MST and
3(n− 2) in the PMFG. Furthermore loops and cliques are
allowed in the PMFG. A clique of r elements, r-clique,
is a subgraph of r elements where each element is linked
to each other. Because of the Kuratowski’s theorem [40]
only 3-cliques and 4-cliques are allowed in the PMFG.
The study of 3-cliques and 4-cliques is relevant for un-
derstanding the strength of clusters in the system [15] as
we will see below in an empirical application. We will
use this property to investigate the topological changes
detected in PMFGs obtained for diﬀerent sampling time
horizons.

The topological properties of diﬀerent graphs will be
investigated by considering several indicators. Speciﬁ-
cally, we consider (i) the shortest path s(i, j), which is
deﬁned as the minimum number of edges crossed by con-
necting vertices i and j in the graph; (ii) the degree k(i),
which is the number of edges connected to the vertex
i; (iii) the betweenness btw(i) obtained as the number of
shortest paths traversing the vertex i and (iv) the connec-
tion strength [41, 42], which is obtained by considering
the ratio between the number of cliques of 3 or 4 elements
present among ns stocks belonging to a given set and a
normalizing quantity. These normalizing quantities are
ns − 3 for 4-cliques and 3 ns − 8 for 3-cliques [15].

III. EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS OF PMFG
NETWORKS

We perform our investigation on the 300 most capital-
ized stocks traded at New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)
during the time period January 2001 to December 2003.
The capitalization value is considered at 12/2003. The
return time series are sampled at diﬀerent time horizons:
5,15,30,65,130,195 and 390 min. The last time horizon of
390 min corresponds to a trading day.

In Figs. 1 and 2 we plot the PMFGs computed with

in the PMFGs in red colors. For the sake of readabil-
ity of the pictures, the tick symbol is reported only for

3

FIG. 1: PMFG at 5 min time horizon. The tick symbol is reported only for 7 stocks, i.e. General Electric (GE), Merrill Lynch
co inc (MER), Wal-Mart stores inc (WMT), Suntrust banks inc (STI), PPG industries inc (PPG), Eaton corp (ETN) and
Jeﬀerson-Pilot corp (JP). These stocks are selected by ranking stocks in decreasing order with respect to the degree and picking
up stocks in the ﬁrst 5 ranking positions in at least one of the graphs of Fig. 1 and Fig. 2. Vertices corresponding to labeled
stocks are also highlighted by circles of larger size. Red links in the graph are corresponding to the MST which is contained in
the PMFG. Vertices are drawn with diﬀerent colors to highlight the economic sector each stock belongs to. Speciﬁcally these
sectors are Basic Materials (violet, 24 stocks), Consumer Cyclical (tan, 22 stocks), Consumer Non Cyclical (yellow, 25 stocks),
Energy (blue, 17 stocks), Services (cyan, 69 stocks), Financial (green, 53 stocks), Healthcare (gray, 19 stocks), Technology (red,
34 stocks), Utilities (magenta, 12 stocks), Transportation (brown, 5 stocks), Conglomerates (orange, 8 stocks) and Capital
Goods (light green, 12 stocks).

7 stocks. These stocks are selected by ranking stocks in
decreasing order with respect to the degree and picking
up stocks in the ﬁrst 5 ranking positions in at least one
of the graphs of Fig. 1 and Fig. 2. The two networks are
quite diﬀerent. In fact the PMFG of 5 min return time
series is more compact than the one obtained for the 390

min time series. This last network clearly shows sev-
eral branches of vertices quite separate from the general
framework. Another diﬀerence concerns the presence of
a few vertices characterized by a very large value of their
degree. This is observed clearly in Fig. 1 and it is less
evident in Fig. 2.

We quantify the degree of compactness of the PMFGs
by computing the average length of shortest paths at dif-
ferent time horizons. The result of our investigation is
shown in Fig. 3. We observe that the average length of
shortest paths is about 3.3 when the time horizon is 5
min. The average length increases by increasing the time
horizon and reaches the maximum value of 4.9 for the

time horizon of 195 min and then decreases to the value
4.4 observed for the daily (390 min) time horizon. We
therefore observe a progressive structuring of the PMFGs
as a function of the time horizon with a maximal level of
structuring present for ∆t = 195 min. We have not yet
an explaination for the presence of a maximal value of
the average length occuring at an intraday time horizon.

FIG. 2: PMFG at daily time horizon. The tick symbol is reported only for 7 stocks, i.e. General Electric (GE), Merrill Lynch
co inc (MER), Wal-Mart stores inc (WMT), Suntrust banks inc (STI), PPG industries inc (PPG), Eaton corp (ETN) and
Jeﬀerson-Pilot corp (JP). These stocks are selected by ranking stocks in decreasing order with respect to the degree and picking
up stocks in the ﬁrst 5 ranking positions in at least one of the graphs of Fig. 1 and Fig. 2. Vertices corresponding to labeled
stocks are also highlighted by circles of larger size. Red links in the graph are corresponding to the MST which is contained in
the PMFG. Vertices are drawn with diﬀerent colors to highlight the economic sector each stock belongs to. Speciﬁcally these
sectors are Basic Materials (violet, 24 stocks), Consumer Cyclical (tan, 22 stocks), Consumer Non Cyclical (yellow, 25 stocks),
Energy (blue, 17 stocks), Services (cyan, 69 stocks), Financial (green, 53 stocks), Healthcare (gray, 19 stocks), Technology (red,
34 stocks), Utilities (magenta, 12 stocks), Transportation (brown, 5 stocks), Conglomerates (orange, 8 stocks) and Capital
Goods (light green, 12 stocks).

We characterize the topological properties of PMFGs
obtained at diﬀerent time horizons by also measuring the
maximal betweenness and the maximal degree of net-
works. In Fig. 4 and in Fig. 5 we show the betweenness
and degree of the two stocks that assume the maximal
value of the betweenness and of degree at diﬀerent time
horizons. Speciﬁcally, the maximal betweenness is de-
tected for General Electric (GE) at short time horizons
and for PPG Industries at time horizons equal or longer
than 195 min. A similar alternate proﬁle is also observed
for the degree in Fig. 5. In fact, for short time horizons
the stock with the maximal degree is GE whereas starting
from ∆t = 130 min the stock with the highest degree is
PPG. It should also be noted from the ﬁgures that both
the betweenness and the degree for GE is monotonously
decreasing when the time horizons increases whereas the
corresponding values observed for PPG are roughly con-

stant. The crossover of the two proﬁles approximately
occurs for time horizon close to the interval 130-195 min.
This time interval contains the time horizon where the
maximum of the average length of shortest paths is de-
It should also be noted the diﬀerent role that

GE and PPG play in the system. The stock GE is a
hub for the whole market whereas the stock PPG is a
hub for its own economic sector (Basic Materials). Fol-
lowing this reasoning one can interpret results of Fig. 4
and Fig. 5 in terms of the diﬀerent interaction between
economic sectors at diﬀerent time horizons. Indeed the
internal structure of sectors is roughly formed already at
short time horizons (see section IV) and this explains the
behavior of betweenness and degree of PPG as functions
of the time horizon. Furthermore Fig. 1 and Fig. 3 sug-
gest that GE at short time horizons strongly intervenes
in the connection between diﬀerent branches (sectors) of

between sectors are more complex and the central role of

IV. CONNECTION STRENGTH OF
ECONOMIC SECTORS ON PMFGS

The topological changes detected in PMFGs have also
been investigated by monitoring the connection strength
inside speciﬁc sectors at diﬀerent time horizons. Eco-
nomic sectors of stocks are deﬁned by using the Yahoo

ﬁnance classiﬁcation of stocks (April 2005). We quan-
tify the connection strength of a subgroup of ns elements
by counting the number C3 of 3-cliques formed by the
elements of the group divided by 3ns − 8, which is the
number of potential 3-cliques that can be formed by ns
elements in a planar graph. A detailed description of
this method and of its usefulness is given in Ref.
[15].
The results of our investigation are summarized in Fig.
6. The connection strength is shown as a function of the

time horizon.
In Fig. 6 we investigate 9 sectors com-
prising 275 stocks over a total of 300. These economic
sectors are basic materials (24 stocks), consumer cyclical
(22 stocks), consumer non cyclical (25 stocks), energy (17
stocks), ﬁnancial (53 stocks), healthcare (19 stocks), ser-
vices (69 stocks), technology (34 stocks) and utilities (12
stocks). The sectors of conglomerates and capital goods
are not considered in the ﬁgure because they have a con-
nection strength low value, which is almost independent
of the speciﬁc time horizon. In Fig. 6 each panel refers
to a single sector.

The nine panels of Fig. 6 show a variety of behavior.
Speciﬁcally, there are sectors like energy, ﬁnancial and
utilities where the connection strength is very close to
one already at the shortest time horizon. This behavior
indicates that the sectors are well deﬁned and driven by
the same factors down to a very short time horizon. On
the other hand, there are sectors like consumer cyclical,
healthcare and services clearly showing that the market
needs a ﬁnite time to produce a proﬁle of correlation com-
patible with the sector classiﬁcation. Moreover, the value
of the connection strength observed for these sectors is
always smaller than 1 at longer time horizons. This fact
indicates that the PMFG analysis does not interpret the
stocks of the considered sector as belonging to a com-
pact region of the PMFG. This might be due to a failure
of the ﬁltering ability of PMFG or might just reﬂect a
marked heterogeneity in the classiﬁcation methods used
in deﬁning the economic sectors. Basic materials, con-
sumer non cyclical, and technology sectors show an in-
termediate behavior characterized by a non marked time
dependence and moderately low values of the overall con-
nection strength.

In order to test whether the behavior observed for
diﬀerent sectors has an economic motivation, therefore
supporting the hypothesis that PMFG is able to detect
proper communities in the correlation based networks,
we have investigated some sub-sectors. Interesting cases
are one sub-sector of the energy economic sector i.e. the
oil well services & equipment sub-sector (5 stocks) and
one sub-sector of the utilities sector, i.e. the electric util-
ities sub sector (10 stocks). Both these sub-sectors have
a connection strength equal to 1 and constant over the
spanned time horizon. A diﬀerent behavior is observed
for the sub-sector major drugs of the healthcare economic
sector, which is composed by 7 stocks and it has associ-
ated a connection strength of 0.85 ± 0.08 at T = 5 min
and T = 15 min and connection strength 1 for T ≥ 30
min. Finally, the sub-sector food processing (consumer
non cyclical) is formed by 11 stocks and has a connec-
tion strength time evolving proﬁle as summarized here:
(T = 5min, 0.56 ± 0.04), (T = 15min, 0.8 ± 0.04), (T =
30min, 0.8 ± 0.04), (T = 65min, 0.92 ± 0.04), (T =
130min, 0.92 ± 0.04), (T = 195min, 0.76 ± 0.04), (T =
In summary all the considered
390min, 0.92 ± 0.04).
sub-sectors show a connection strength greater or at
most equal to the connection strength of the economic
sector they belong to. Furthermore all the considered

sub-sectors are signiﬁcantly intra-connected before or
at most at the same time horizon as the corresponding
economic sector.

V. CONCLUSIONS

The measure of the average length of shortest path in
the PMFG shows a small world eﬀect present in the net-
works at any time horizon. The amount of the eﬀect is
varying with the sampling time horizon. The more struc-
tured network is observed for the intraday time horizon
of 195 min. The study of the degree and the between-
ness of stocks allows to distinguish the market role of
representative stocks. For example, GE is a hub for the
whole market at short time horizons and its relevance
decreases according to the structuring of the market into
sectors observed at long time horizon. On the contrary,
the stock PPG results to be a local hub (i.e. hub of
the economic sector it belongs to - basic materials) both
at short and long time horizons. The fact that the be-
tweenness and the degree of PPG are roughly constant as
a function of the time horizon suggests that the sector of
basic materials is formed already at short time horizons.
This fact is also supported by the measure of connection
strength for the speciﬁc considered sector. Other sec-
tors, such as consumer cyclical, healthcare and services
are characterized by a diﬀerent behavior showing a time
dependence in the structuring of the stocks belonging to
these sectors. Finally, we have observed economic sub-
sectors such as oil well services & equipment and electric
utilities being already formed at the 5 min time hori-
zon and characterized by the maximum allowed value of
the connection strength, i.e. 1. These results show that
the market is progressively structured as a function of
the time horizon. The analysis of connection strength of
sub-sectors and sectors as a function of the time hori-
zon suggests that the market structuring occurs by ﬁrst
connecting stocks belonging to the same sub-sector and
then connecting stocks belonging to the same economic
sector.

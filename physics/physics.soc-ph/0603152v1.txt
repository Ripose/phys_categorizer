We study analytically and numerically Minority Games in which agents may invest in diﬀerent
assets (or markets), considering both the canonical and the grand-canonical versions. We ﬁnd that
the likelihood of agents trading in a given asset depends on the relative amount of information
available in that market. More speciﬁcally, in the canonical game players play preferentially in the
stock with less information. The same holds in the grand canonical game when agents have positive
incentives to trade, whereas when agents payoﬀ are solely related to their speculative ability they
display a larger propensity to invest in the information-rich asset. Furthermore, in this model one
ﬁnds a globally predictable phase with broken ergodicity.

INTRODUCTION

The study of systems of heterogeneous adaptive agents
through Minority Games (MGs) [1, 2] has attracted much
interest from statistical physicists. Despite the simplicity
of the interactions between agents, these models generate
rich static and dynamical structures which can often be
well understood at the mathematical level through the
use of spin-glass techniques [3, 4]. While the MG has
found applications in diﬀerent types of problems (see for
example [5]), it was originally designed to address the is-
sue of how the microscopic behavior of traders – specula-
tors in particular – may give rise to the anomalous global
ﬂuctuation phenomena observed empirically in ﬁnancial
markets. In this respect the most successful version of
the MG has perhaps been the grand-canonical MG [6, 7],
in which traders may abstain from investing, so that the
traded volume ﬂuctuates in time.

The core of MGs is the assumption that traders react
to the receipt of an information pattern (be it exogenous
or endogenous) by taking a simple trading decision such
as buying or selling. The key control parameter is the
ratio between the number of traders and the ‘complexity’
of the information space, measured by the number of
possible patterns.
In general, when this ratio exceeds
a certain threshold MGs undergo a phase transition to
a macroscopically eﬃcient state where it is not possible
to predict statistically whether a certain decision will be
fruitful or not based on the received information alone.
Real markets are typically formed by diﬀerent assets
and are characterized by non trivial correlations [8–10].
These correlations arise from the underlying behavior
of the economics (the fundamentals) but they are also
“dressed” by the eﬀect of ﬁnancial trading. In this pa-
per, we will use the Minority Game in order to investi-
gate how speculative trading aﬀects the diﬀerent assets
in a market. Versions of MG where agents are engaged
in diﬀerent contexts have already been introduced and
studied [11, 12]. More precisely, we shall investigate how
speculative trading contributes to ﬁnancial correlations,

and how speculators distribute their trading volume de-
pending on the information content of the diﬀerent asset
markets.

Our ﬁrst result is that speculative trading does not
contribute in a sensible manner to ﬁnancial correlations,
and if it does, it likely contributes a negative correlation.
The reason is that, within the schematic picture of the
MG, speculators are uniquely driven by proﬁt considera-
tions and totally disregard risk. The same cannot be said
for strategies on lower frequencies (buy and hold) where
risk minimization of the portfolio becomes important.

Our second main conclusion is that, when there are
positive incentives to trade, speculators invest preferen-
tially on the asset with the smallest information content.
This apparently paradoxical conclusion is reverted when
speculators have no incentive to trade, other than making
a proﬁt. This is due to the fact that speculators, when
they are forced to trade also contribute to information
asymmetries.

Finally, with respect to the usual classiﬁcation in
phases of the MG, we ﬁnd a considerably richer phase
diagram where diﬀerent components of the market may
be in diﬀerent phases. These conclusions are derived for
the case of a market composed of two assets, which allows
for a simpler treatment and provides a more transparent
picture. Their validity can be extended in straightfor-
ward ways to the case of markets with a generic number
of assets.

The paper is articulated in three parts. Section II is
dedicated to the study of a canonical MG where agents
In Sec-
can choose on which of two assets to invest.
tion III we discuss the grand-canonical version of this
model, where agents are also allowed to refrain from in-
vesting. Finally, we formulate our conclusions in Sec. IV.
The mathematical analysis of the models we consider is
a generalization of calculations abundantly discussed in
the literature (see [3, 4] for recent reviews). We therefore
won’t go into the details, limiting ourselves to stressing
the main diﬀerences with the standard cases.

It is clear, already at this stage, that if no a priori cor-

Fig. 1. The (α+, α−) plane is divided in two regions
separated by a critical line. In the ergodic regime, the
system produces exploitable information, i.e. H > 0, and
the dynamics is ergodic, that is the steady state turns out
to be independent of the initialization Uiγ(0) of (1). Be-

erties (e.g. diﬀerent volatility).
In this region traders
manage to wash out the information and the system is
unpredictable (H = 0). This scenario essentially repro-
duces the standard MG phase transition picture. The
model can be solved analytically in two complementary
ways and in both cases calculations are a straightforward
generalization of those valid for the single-asset case. The

tion means that if mi > 0 then agent i invests preferen-
tially in asset + because that is more convenient. There-
fore, Fig. 2 implies that the relation between payoﬀs
and information is less obvious than the na¨ıve argument
above suggests.

This somewhat paradoxical result is due to the fact
that agents are constrained to trade in one of the two
markets. Rather than seeking the most proﬁtable asset,
agents escape the asset where their loss is largest.

III. GRAND CANONICAL MINORITY GAME
WITH TWO ASSETS

}

1, 1

In the grand-canonical framework players have the op-
tion not to play if their expected payoﬀ doesn’t beat a
pre-determined benchmark (which represents for instance
a ﬁxed interest rate or an incentive to enter the market)
[7]. As in the previous case, we consider two assets or
as before. Each trader

Again µγ(t) are chosen at random independently for all
t and γ =
1. As in the one-asset grand-canonical MG,
it is necessary to introduce a certain number of traders
– so-called producers – who invest at every time step no
matter what. These can be regarded as traders with a
ﬁxed strategy bµγ
1. The number of producers in
market γ shall be denoted by Np,γ and their aggregate
contribution to Aγ(t) by Bµγ (t)

The rest of the traders, the speculators, have an adaptive

now agents can also decide not to trade. This choice is
equivalent to trading in a ﬁctitious γ = 0 “asset” whose
cumulated score is Ui,0(t) = ǫt. More precisely

are as follows: ǫ = 0.1, np = 1 (⋄); ǫ = 0.1, np = 0.1 (△);

i.e.
if the corresponding score Uiγ grows at least as ǫt.
Notice that agents are allowed to invest in at most one
asset. If agents were allowed to invest in both γ =
1
±
assets if Ui,±(t) > Ui,0(t) then it is easy to see that the
model becomes equivalent to two un-coupled GCMGs.

The arguments of the previous section show that also
in this case no signiﬁcant correlation between assets is
introduced by the behavior of speculators. Again the
collective properties of the stationary state can be char-
acterized by the predictability H, Eq. (4), the volatil-
ity σ2, Eq. (5) and the “magnetization” m of Eq. (6).
These parameters can be studied as before upon varying
the parameters αγ = Pγ/N and ǫ. We also introduce the
relative number of producers np = Np,γ/Pγ, which for
simplicity is assumed to be the same for both assets. No-
tice that for np = 0 and ǫ
we recover the model
of the previous section where there are no producers and
speculators are forced to trade.

→ −∞

We focus ﬁrst on m (see Fig. 3). One sees that when
traders have positive incentives to trade (ǫ < 0) the mar-
ket behaves as in the previous section, with speculators
investing preferentially in the asset with less information.
This tendency becomes less pronounced the larger is np,
which is reasonable in view of our discussion above, be-
cause then the game becomes more and more proﬁtable
for speculators.

This scenario is qualitatively reproduced at all ǫ < 0
and it changes drastically as soon as ǫ > 0. In this case,
traders concentrate most of their investments into the
information-rich asset even if np is very low. The fact
that traders can refrain from investing implies that trad-

6
ing is dominated by gain seeking rather than escaping
losses.

The theory for this case is slightly more involved than
for the canonical model. On the static side, the Hamil-

of this model is rather complex (see Fig. 4). We have
been unable to obtain analytical lines for the complete
phase structure at ǫ = 0. The phase boundary sepa-
rating the region with H = 0 from that with H > 0
has been calculated assuming that both susceptibilities
diverge keeping a ﬁnite ratio χ+/χ−. The phase bound-
ary of the non-ergodic region (which would correspond
to the divergence of just one of the susceptibilities) has
been instead estimated from numerical simulations and
the corresponding lines must be considered a crude ap-
proximation.

This line is entirely contained in the non-ergodic phase.
While the market remains globally predictable (H > 0)
the fact that one of the markets becomes unpredictable
(e.g. H+ = 0) implies that the steady state depends
on initial conditions. It is ﬁnally worth mentioning that
the non-ergodic regimes with one unpredictable market
extend to large values of αγ.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have studied a multi-asset version of the Minority
Game in order to address the problem of how adaptive
heterogeneous agents would diversify their investments
when the diﬀerent assets bear diﬀerent levels of informa-
tion. While the phase structure of the models is substan-
tially a generalization of that of single-asset games, we

have found, in the grand-canonical model, a remarkable
dependence of the probability to invest in a certain asset
on the agent’s incentives to trade (ǫ). Speciﬁcally, agents
who have no incentives to trade other than the gains
derived from it, invest preferentially in information-rich
assets. On the contrary, when there are positive incen-
tives to trade (ǫ < 0) agents invest more likely in the
information-poor asset. This same behaviour is found in
the canonical model, where agents must choose one asset
at each time step and cannot refrain from entering the
market.

The generalization of our results to a larger number
of assets or to a wider strategy pool for the agents is
straightforward. The results discussed here are indicative
of the generic qualitative behavior we expect.

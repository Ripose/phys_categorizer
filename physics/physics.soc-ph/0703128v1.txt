Comment on “Scaling in Ecosystems and the
Linkage of Macroecological Laws”

In a recent Letter [1], Banavar et al. discuss scaling as
a possible origin of several macroecological laws. They
present a scaling theory based on a simple scaling form
between the abundance n and the typical mass m of a
species in an area A (Hypothesis 1 in Ref. [1]):

P (m, n|A) = n

−∆1m

−∆2F

.

(cid:16)

(1)

This form, corresponding to what is called ”gap scaling”
in the theory of critical phenomena [2], can indeed ac-
count for a number of observations about power law be-
havior in real data. However, in this Comment we show
evidence that this form cannot be complete.

Taylor [3] showed in 1961 that for ﬁxed species, when
and the

varying the habitat area (A) the variance
hn|Ai mean of its population behaves as

σ2|A
(cid:11)
(cid:10)

σ2|A
(cid:11)
(cid:10)

=

n2|A
(cid:11)
(cid:10)

− hn|Ai2 ∝ hn|Ai2α .

(2)

Eq. (2) is called Taylor’s law and it constitutes one of
the few quantitative laws with general validity in ecol-
ogy. Since this work many observations showed that α
is species speciﬁc and it is predominantly in the range
(1/2, 1) [4]. It can be shown that α = 1/2 and α = 1 are
limiting cases. The former can be the consequence of the
central limit theorem, while the latter is attributed to a
kind of synchronization [5]. If we follow Ref. [1],

hnq|Ai =

dnP (m, n|A) ∼ KqAΦ1max[0,1+q−∆1], (3)

∞

where ”∼” denotes asymptotic equality and Kq > 0. The
variable m can be omitted, because we only look a single
species, where m is ﬁxed. From Eq. (3)

σ2|A
(cid:11)
(cid:10)
K2AΦ1max[0,3−∆1] − K 2

− hn|Ai2 ∼
n2|A
(cid:11)
(cid:10)
1 A2Φ1max[0,2−∆1].

=

Ref. [1] shows that ∆1 ≥ 1, so the ﬁrst exponent is larger
and it will dominate the scaling. We combine Eqs. (2)-
(4), eliminate A and ﬁnd that for all species

(4)

(5)

α =

max[0, 3 − ∆1]
2 × max[0, 2 − ∆1]

.

Now there are three possible scenarios: (i) If ∆1 ≥ 2, then
according to Eq. (3) hn|Ai ∼ K1 regardless of area, which
contradicts the extensivity of population abundance (also
shown by Ref. [1]). (ii) If 1 ≤ ∆1 < 2, then α > 1 which
suggests that population ﬂuctuations are super-extensive,
they grow faster with the area than the mean itself. In
this case large populations are unstable and they become
extinct instead of reaching equilibrium where Eq.
(1)
can be meaningful. This regime has been observed in
very few cases. (iii) If ∆ = 1 then α = 1.

|A¸ ∝ hn|Ai

Although there exist species with α ≈ 1, this value is
by no means universal (see Fig. 1 for real data [3]). It is
important to note that Taylor’s law has been observed in
a broad range of phenomena [5,6], where often limiting
exponents (1/2 or 1) were found but in some cases, like
for the stock market [6] and for the Internet traﬃc again
intermediate exponents are valid [5].

As for ecology and the conﬂict between this empirical
evidence and Eq. (1), a way out could be to assume mul-
tiscaling instead of the simple gap scaling. That would
allow for a richer scaling behavior of hnq|Ai.
In fact,
our previous analysis of stock market data indicated the
existence of such multiscaling [6].

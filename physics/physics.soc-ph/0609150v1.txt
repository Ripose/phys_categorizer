In this paper, we propose a modiﬁed susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model, in which each
node is assigned with an identical capability of active contacts, A, at each time step. In contrast
to the previous studies, we ﬁnd that on scale-free networks, the density of the recovered individuals
in the present model shows a threshold behavior. We obtain the analytical results using the mean-
ﬁeld theory and ﬁnd that the threshold value equals 1/A, indicating that the threshold value is
independent of the topology of the underlying network. The simulations agree well with the analytic
results. Furthermore, we study the time behavior of the epidemic propagation and ﬁnd a hierarchical
dynamics with three plateaus. Once the highly connected hubs are reached, the infection pervades
almost the whole network in a progressive cascade across smaller degree classes. Then, after the
previously infected hubs are recovered, the disease can only propagate to the class of smallest degree
till the infected individuals are all recovered. The present results could be of practical importance
in the setup of dynamic control strategies.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Many real-world systems can be described by com-
plex networks, ranging from nature to society. Re-
cently, power-law degree distributions have been ob-
served in various networks [1, 2]. One of the original,
and still primary reasons for studying networks is to un-
derstand the mechanisms by which diseases and other
things, such as information and rumors spread over [3, 4].
For instance, the study of networks of sexual contact
[5, 6, 7] is helpful for us to understand and perhaps
control the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. The
susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) [8, 9], susceptible-
infected-removed (SIR) [10, 11], and susceptible-infected
(SI) [12, 13, 14] models on complex networks have been
In this paper, we mainly
extensively studied recently.
concentrate on the behaviors of SIR model.

The standard SIR style contains some unexpected as-
sumptions while being introduced to the scale-free (SF)
networks directly, that is, each node’s potential infection-
activity (infectivity), measured by its possibly maximal
contribution to the propagation process within one time
step, is strictly equal to its degree. As a result, in the
SF network the nodes with large degree, called hubs, will
take the greater possession of the infectivity. This as-
sumption cannot represent all the cases in the real world,
owing to that the hub nodes may be only able to contact
limited population at one period of time despite their
wide acquaintance. The ﬁrst striking example is that, in
many existing peer-to-peer distributed systems, although
their long-term communicating connectivity shows the
scale-free characteristic, all peers have identical capa-
bilities and responsibilities to communication at a short

term, such as the Gnutella networks [15, 16]. Second, in
the epidemic contact networks, the hub node has many
acquaintances; however, he/she could not contact all
his/her acquaintances within one time step [17]. Third,
in some email service systems, such as the Gmail system
schemed out by Google , their clients are assigned by lim-
ited capability to invite others to become Google-users
[18]. The last, in network marketing processes, the refer-
ral of a product to potential consumers costs money and
time(e.g. a salesman has to make phone calls to persuade
his social surrounding to buy the product). Therefore,
generally speaking, the salesman will not make referrals
to all his acquaintances [19]. Similar phenomena are com-
mon in our daily lives. Consequently, diﬀerent styles of
the practical lives are thirst for research on it and that
may delight us something interesting which could oﬀer
the direction in the real lives.

II. THE MODEL

First of all, we brieﬂy review the standard SIR model.
At each time step, each node adopts one of three possi-
ble states and during one time step, the susceptible (S)
node which is connected to the infected (I) one will be
infected with a rate β. Meanwhile, the infected nodes
will be recovered (R) with a rate γ, deﬁning the eﬀec-
tive spreading rate λ = β/γ. Without losing generality,
we can set γ = 1. Accordingly, one can easily obtain
the probability that a susceptible individual x will be
infected at time step t to be

λx(t) = 1 − (1 − λ)θ(x,t−1),

where θ(x, t − 1) denotes the number of contacts between
x and its infected neighbors at time t − 1. For small λ,
one has

and Rk(t), which are the densities of infected, susceptible,
and recovered nodes of degree k at time t, respectively.
Clearly, these variables obey the normalization condition:

Ik(t) + Sk(t) + Rk(t) = 1.

(3)

 

 

Global quantities such as the epidemic prevalence are
therefore expressed by the average over the various con-
k P (k)Rk(t). Using the
nectivity classes; i.e., R(t) =
mean-ﬁeld approximation, the rate equations for the par-
tial densities in a network characterized by the degree
distribution P (k) can be written as:

The black line represents the case of standard SIR model, and
the blue, green and red curves represent the present model
with A = 4, 5 and 6, respectively. The arrows point at the
critical points obtained from simulations. One can see clear
from the inset that the analytic results agree well with the
simulations.

In the standard SIR network model, each individual will
contact all its neighbors once at each time step, and
therefore the infectivity of each node is equal to its de-
gree and θ(x, t) is equal to the number of x’s infected
neighbors at time t. However, in the present model, we
assume every individual has the same infectivity A. That
is to say, at each time step, each infected individual will
generate A contacts where A is a constant. Multiple
contacts to one neighbor are allowed, and contacts not
between susceptible and infected ones, although without
any eﬀect on the epidemic dynamics, are also counted
just like the standard SIR model. The dynamical pro-
cess starts with randomly selecting one infected node.
During the ﬁrst stage of the evolution, the number of in-
fected nodes increases. Since this also implies a growth
of the recovered population, the ineﬀective contacts be-
come more frequent. After a while, in consequence, the
infected population begins to decline. Eventually, it van-
ishes and the evolution stops. Without special statement,
all the following simulation results are obtained by aver-
aging over 100 independent runs for each of 300 diﬀerent
realizations, based on the Barab´asi-Albert (BA) [1] net-
work model.

III. SIMULATION AND RESULTS

Toward the standard SIR model, Moreno et al. ob-
tained the analytical value of threshold hki/hk2i [11].
Similarly, we consider the time evolution of Ik(t), Sk(t)

where the conditional probability P (k′|k) denotes the de-
gree correlations that a vertex of degree k is connected
to a vertex of degree k′. Considering the uncorrelated
network, P (k′|k) = k′P (k′)/hki, thus Eq. (4) takes the
form:

ﬁne the SIR model on any complex network with degree
distribution P (k). We will consider in particular the case
of a homogeneous initial distribution of infected nodes,
I 0
k = I 0. In this case, in the limit I 0 → 0, we can substi-
tute Ik(0) ≃ 0 and Sk(0) = 1. Under this approximation
and by taking the similar converting like from Eq. (4) to
Eq. (7), Eq. (5) can be directly integrated, yielding

(17)

below which the epidemic prevalence is null, and above
which it attains a ﬁnite value. Correspondingly, the pre-
vious works about epidemic spreading in SF networks
present us with completely new epidemic propagation
scenarios that a highly heterogeneous structure will lead
to the absence of any epidemic threshold. While, now, it
is 1/A instead (see the simulation and analytic results in
Fig. 1). Furthermore, we can also ﬁnd that the larger of
identical infectivity A, the higher of density of R(∞) for
the same λ from Fig. 1.

From the analytical result, λc = 1/A, one can see that
the threshold value is independent of the topology if the
underlying network is valid for the mean-ﬁeld approx-
imation [20]. To further demonstrate this proposition,
we next compare the simulation results on diﬀerent net-
works. From Fig. 2, one can ﬁnd that the threshold
values of random networks, BA networks with diﬀerent
average degrees, and BA networks with diﬀerent sizes
are the same, which strongly support the above analysis.
Note that, in the standard SIR model, there exists obvi-
ously ﬁnite-size eﬀect [10, 21], while in the present model,
there is no observed ﬁnite-size eﬀect (see Fig. 3(c)).

IV. VELOCITY AND HIERARCHICAL SPREAD

For further understanding the spreading dynamics of
the present model, we study the time behavior of the
(8),
epidemic propagation. Originated from the Eq.
Sk(t) = e−λkφ(t), which result is valid for any value of
the degree of k and the function φ(t) is positive and
monotonically increasing. This last fact implies that Sk
is decreasing monotonically towards zero as time goes
on. For any two values k > k′, and whatever the ini-
k′ are, there exists a time t′
tial conditions S0
after which Sk(t) < Sk′ (t). A more precise characteri-
zation of the epidemic diﬀusion through the network can

that all of the curves show an initial plateau (see also a
few previous works on hierarchical dynamics of the epi-
demic spreading [12, 22, 23] ), which denotes that the
infection takes control of the large degree vertices ﬁrstly.
Once the highly connected hubs are reached, the infec-
tion pervades almost the whole network via a hierarchi-
cal cascade across smaller degree classes. Thus, hkR(t)i
decreases to a temporary plateau, which approximates
hki = 2m. At last, since the previously infected nodes
recovered, all of which can be regarded as the barriers of
spreading, the infection can only propagate to the small-
est degree class. Then, the spreading process stops ﬂeetly
once the infected nodes are all recovered, as illustrated
that hkR(t)i decreases to zero rapidly.

Furthermore, we present the inverse participation ra-
tio Y2(t) [24] to indicate the detailed information on the
infection propagation. First we deﬁne the weight of re-
covered individuals with degree k by wk(t) = Rk(t)/R(t).
The quantity Y2(t) is then deﬁned as:

Y2(t) =

w2

k(t).

Xk

(21)

Clearly, if Y2 is small, the infected individuals are ho-
mogeneously distributed among all degree classes; on the
contrary, if Y2 is relatively larger, then the infection is
localized on some speciﬁc degree classes. As shown in
Fig. 3(b), the function Y2(t) has a maximum at the early
time stage, which implies that the infection is localized
on the large degree k classes, as can also inferred from
Fig. 3(a). Afterwards Y2(t) decreases, with the infection
progressively invading the lower degree classes, and pro-
viding a more homogeneous diﬀusion of infected vertices
in the various degree classes. And then, Y2(t) increases
gradually, which denotes the capillary invasion of the low-
est degree classes. Finally, when Y2(t) slowly comes to
the steady stage, the whole process ends.

be achieved by studying some convenient quantities in
numerical spreading experiments in BA networks. First,
we measure the average degree of newly recovered nodes
at time t, which is equal to the average degree of newly
infected nodes at time t − 1,

In Fig. 3(a), we plot this quantity for BA networks as
a function of the time t for diﬀerent values of A and ﬁnd
a hierarchical dynamics with three plateaus. We can ﬁnd

In this paper, we investigated the behaviors of SIR epi-
demics with an identical infectivity A. In the standard
SIR model, the capability of the infection totally relies
on the node’s degree, and therefore it leaves some prac-
tical spreading behaviors alone, such as in the pear-to-
pear, sexual contact, Gmail server system, and marketing
networks. Accordingly, this work is of not only theo-
retic interesting, but also practical value. We obtained
the analytical result of the threshold value λc = 1/A,
which agree well with the numerical simulation. In ad-
dition, even though the activity of hub nodes are de-
pressed in the present model, the hierarchical behavior
of epidemic spreading is clearly observed, which is in ac-
cordance with some real situations. For example, in the
spreading of HIV in Africa [25], the high-risk population,
such as druggers and homosexual men, are always ﬁrstly
infected. And then, this disease diﬀuse to the general
population.

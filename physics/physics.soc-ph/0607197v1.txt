Abstract

We have recently introduced the “thermal optimal path” (TOP) method to inves-
tigate the real-time lead-lag structure between two time series. The TOP method
consists in searching for a robust noise-averaged optimal path of the distance matrix
along which the two time series have the greatest similarity. Here, we generalize the
TOP method by introducing a more general deﬁnition of distance which takes into
account possible regime shifts between positive and negative correlations. This gen-
eralization to track possible changes of correlation signs is able to identify possible
transitions from one convention (or consensus) to another. Numerical simulations
on synthetic time series verify that the new TOP method performs as expected
even in the presence of substantial noise. We then apply it to investigate changes
of convention in the dependence structure between the historical volatilities of the
USA inﬂation rate and economic growth rate. Several measures show that the new
TOP method signiﬁcantly outperforms standard cross-correlation methods.

1 Introduction

The study of the lead-lag structure between two time series X(t) and Y (t)
has a long history, especially in economics, econometrics and ﬁnance, as it
is often asked which economic variable might inﬂuence other economic phe-
nomena. A simple measure is the lagged cross-correlation function CX,Y (τ ) =
hX(t)Y (t + τ )i/qVar[X]Var[Y ], where the brackets hxi denotes the statistical
expectation of the random variable x and Var[x] is the variance of x. The
observation of a maximum of CX,Y (τ ) at some non-zero positive time lag τ
implies that the knowledge of X at time t gives some information on the fu-
ture realization of Y at the later time t + τ . However, such correlations do not
imply necessarily causality in a strict sense as a correlation may be mediated
by a common source inﬂuencing the two time series at diﬀerent times. The
concept of Granger causality bypasses this problem by taking a pragmatic ap-
proach based on predictability: if the knowledge of X(t) and of its past values
improves the prediction of Y (t + τ ) for some τ > 0, then it is said that X
Granger causes Y (see, e.g., [1,2,3]). Such a deﬁnition does not address the
fundamental philosophical and epistemological question of the real causality
links between X and Y but has been found useful in practice. Our approach
is similar in that it does not address the question of the existence of a genuine
causality but attempts to detect a dependence structure between two time
series at non-zero (possibly varying) lags. We thus use the term “causality” in
a loose sense embodying the notion of a dependence between two time series
with a non-zero lag time.

Many alternative methods have been developed in the physical community.
Quiroga et al. proposed a simple and fast method to measure synchronicity and
time delay patterns between two time series based on event synchronization [4].
Furthermore, as a generalization of the concept of recurrence plot to analyze
complex chaotic time series [5], Marwan et al. developed cross-recurrence plot
based on a distance matrix to unravel nonlinear mapping of times between two
systems [6,7]. In Ref. [8], we have introduced a novel non-parametric method
to test for the dynamical time evolution of the lag-lead structure between two
arbitrary time series based on a thermal averaging of optimal paths embedded
in the distance matrix previously introduced in cross-recurrence plots. This
method ignores the thresholds used previously in constructing cross recurrence
plot [6,7] and focuses on the distance matrix. The idea consists in constructing
a distance matrix based on the matching of all sample data pairs obtained
from the two time series under study. The lag-lead structure is searched for
as the optimal path in the distance matrix landscape that minimizes the total
mismatch between the two time series, and that obeys a one-to-one causal
matching condition. To make the solution robust with respect to the presence
of noise that may lead to spurious structures in the distance matrix landscape,
Sornette and Zhou generalized this search for a single absolute optimal path

2

by introducing a fuzzy search consisting in sampling over all possible paths,
each path being weighted according to a multinomial logit or equivalently
Boltzmann factor proportional to the exponential of the global mismatch of
this path [8]. The method is referred to in the sequel as the thermal optimal
path (TOP). Zhou and Sornette investigated further the TOP method by
considering diﬀerence topologies of feasible paths and found that the two-layer
scheme gives the best performance [9].

Here, we generalize the TOP method by introducing a deﬁnition of distance
which takes into account possible regime shifts between positive and negative
correlations. This extension allows us to detect possible changes in the sign of
the correlation between the two time series. This is in part motivated by the
problem of identifying changes of conventions in economic and ﬁnancial time
series. Keynes [10] and Orl´ean [11,12,13,14,15,16,17] developed the concept of
convention, according to which a pattern can emerge from the self-fulﬁlling
belief of agents acting on the belief itself. Conventions are subject to shifts: in a
recent study, Wyart and Bouchaud claimed that the correlation between bond
markets and stock markets was positive in the past (because low long term
interest rates should favor stocks), but has recently quite suddenly become
negative as a new “Flight To Quality” convention has set in: selling risky
stocks and buying safe bonds has recently been the dominant pattern [18].
Similarly, Liu and Liu analyzed the nexus between the historical volatility of
the output and of the inﬂation rate, using Chinese data from 1992 to 2004 [19].
They found that there is a strong correlation between the two volatilities and,
what is more interesting, that the rolling correlation coeﬃcient changes sign.
Such a change of sign of the correlation may be attributed either to a shift
in convention and/or to changing macroeconomic variables, the two being
possible entangled. Our method does not address the source of the change
of the sign of the correlation but provides nevertheless a preliminary tool for
detecting such changes of correlations in an time-adaptive lead-lag framework.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present a brief description
of our generalized TOP method. We recall that an advantage of the TOP
method is that it does not require any a priori knowledge of the underlying
dynamics. The new TOP method is illustrated with the help of synthetic
numerical simulations in Section 3. Section 4 presents the application of the
method to the investigation of a possible change of dependence between the
historical volatility of the USA inﬂation rate and the economic growth rate.
Section 5 concludes.

2 Thermal optimal path method

In Refs.[8,9], we have presented the TOP method and several tests and appli-
cations. In this section, to be self-contained, we brieﬂy recall its main charac-
teristics in the context of the new proposed distance.

Consider two standardized time series {X(t1) : t1 = 0, ..., N} and {Y (t2) :
t2 = 0, ...N}. The elements of the distance matrix EX,Y between X to Y used
in Refs. [8,9] are deﬁned as

ǫ−(t1, t2) = [X(t1) − Y (t2)]2 .

(1)

The value [X(t1) − Y (t2)]2 deﬁnes the distance between the realizations of the
ﬁrst time series at time t1 and the second time series at time t2.

The distance matrix (1) tracks the co-monotonic relationship between X and
Y . But, two time series can be more anti-monotonic than monotonic, i.e., they
tend to take opposite signs. Consider two limiting cases: (i) Y (t) = X(t) and
(ii) Y (t) = −X(t). Obviously, using the traditional distance (1) identiﬁes case
(i) as minimizing expression (1) for t1 = t2 (actually the minimum is identically
zero in this special case). In contrast, notwithstanding the fact that Y (t) is
perfectly (anti-)correlated with X(t), the naive idea of minimizing the distance
(1) between the two time series becomes meaningless. In order to diagnose the
occurrence of anti-correlation, one needs to consider the “anti-monotonic”
distance

ǫ+(t1, t2) = [X(t1) + Y (t2)]2 .
The + sign ensures a correct search of synchronization between two anti-
correlated time series. More generally, X and Y may exhibit more complicated
lead-lag correlation relationships, positive correlation over some time intervals
and negative correlation at other times (as in the change of conventions men-
tioned in the introduction). In order to address all possible situations, we
propose to use the mixed distance expressed as follows:

(2)

ǫ±(t1, t2) = min[ǫ−(t1, t2), ǫ+(t1, t2)] .

(3)

Fig. 1 is a schematic representation of how lead-lag paths are deﬁned. The
ﬁrst (resp. second) time series is indexed by the time t1 (resp. t2). The nodes
of the plane carry the values of the distance (3) for each pair (t1, t2). The path
along the diagonal corresponds to taking t1 = t2, i.e., compares the two time
series at the same time. Paths below (resp. above) the diagonal correspond to
the second time series lagging behind (resp. leading) the ﬁrst time series. The
ﬁgure shows three arrows which deﬁne the three causal steps (time ﬂows from
the past to the future both for t1 and t2) allowed in our construction of the
lead-lag paths. A given path selects a contiguous set of nodes from the lower

4

left to the upper right. The relevance or quality of a given path with respect
to the detection of the lead-lag relationship between the two time series is
quantiﬁed by the sum of the distances (3) along its length.

As shown in the ﬁgure, it is convenient to use the rotated coordinate system
(x, t) such that

t1 = 1 + (t − x) /2

t2 = 1 + (t + x) /2

,






(4)

where t is in the main diagonal direction of the (t1, t2) system and x is per-
pendicular to t. The origin (x = 0, t = 0) corresponds to (t1 = 1, t2 = 1).
Then, the standard reference path is the diagonal of equation x = 0, and
paths which have x(t) 6= 0 deﬁne varying lead-lag patterns. The idea of the
TOP method is to identify the lead-lag relationship between two time series as
the best path in a certain sense. One could ﬁrst infer that the best path is the
one which has the minimum sum of its distances (3) along its length (paths
are constructed with equal lengths so as to be comparable). The problem with
this idea is that the noises decorating the two time series introduce spuri-
ous patterns which may control the determination the path which minimizes
the sum of distances, leading to incorrect inferred lead-lag relationships. In
Refs.[8,9], we have shown that a robust lead-lag path is obtained by deﬁning
an average over many paths, each weighted according to a Boltzmann-Gibbs
factor, hence the name “thermal” optimal path method.

and of the rotated frame (t, x) as deﬁned in the text. The three arrows depict the
three moves that are allowed to reach any node in one step.

Concretely, we ﬁrst calculate the partition functions G(x, t) and their sum
Px G(x, t) so that G(x, t)/G(t) can be interpreted as the probabil-
G(t) =
ity for a path to be at distance x from the diagonal for a distance t along

5

the diagonal. This probability G(x, t)/G(t) is determined as a compromise
between minimizing the mismatch (similar to an “energy”) and maximizing
the combinatorial weight of the number of paths with similar mismatchs in
a neighborhood (similar to an “entropy”). As illustrated in Figure 1, in or-
der to arrive at (t1 + 1, t2 + 1), a path can come from (t1 + 1, t2) vertically,
(t1, t2 + 1) horizontally, or (t1, t2) diagonally. The recursive equation on G(x, t)
is therefore

G(x, t + 1) = [G(x − 1, t) + G(x + 1, t) + G(x, t − 1)]e−ǫ±(x,t)/T ,

(5)

where ǫ±(x, t) is deﬁned by (3). This recursion relation uses the same principle
and is derived following following the work of Wang et al. [20]. To G(x, t) at
the t-th layer, we need to know and bookkeep the previous two layers from
G(·, t−2) to G(·, t−1). After G(·, t) is determined, the G’s at the two layers are
normalized by G(t) so that G(x, t) does not diverge at large t. We stress that
the boundary condition of G(x, t) plays an crucial role. For t = 0 and t = 1,
G(x, t) = 1. For t > 1, the boundary condition is taken to be G(x = ±t, t) = 0,
in order to prevent paths to remain on the boundaries.

Once the partition functions G(x, t) have been calculated, we can obtain any
statistical average related to the positions of the paths weighted by the set of
G(x, t). For instance, the local time lag hx(t)i at time t is given by

hx(t)i =

xG(x, t)/G(t) .

X
x

(6)

Expression (6) deﬁnes hxi(t) as the thermal average of the local time lag at
t over all possible lead-lag conﬁgurations suitably weighted according to the
exponential of minus the measure ǫ±(x, t) of the similarities of two time series.
For a given x0 and temperature T , we determine the thermal optimal path
hxi(t). We can also deﬁne an “energy” eT (x0) to this path, deﬁned as the
thermal average of the measure ǫ±(x, t) of the similarities of two time series:

eT (x0) =

2(N − |x0|) − 1

2N −1−|x0|

ǫ±(x, t)G(x, t)/G(t) .

(7)

Obviously, the same set of calculations can be performed with ǫ− given by (1)
or with ǫ+ given by (2). The former case has been investigated in Refs.[8,9].

3 Numerical experiments of the TOP approach on synthetic ex-

amples

We now present synthetic tests of the eﬃciency of the optimal thermal causal
path method to detect multiple changes of regime. Consider the following


where η is a Gaussian white noise with variance σ2
η and zero mean. By con-
struction, the time series Y is lagging behind X with τ = 10 in the ﬁrst 100
time steps, Y is still lagging behind X with a reduced lag τ = 5 in the next
100 time steps, and ﬁnally Y leads X with a lead time τ = −5 in the last 100
time steps. In addition, Y becomes negatively correlated with X in the middle
interval, while it is positively correlated with X in the ﬁrst and third interval.
The time series X is assumed to be the ﬁrst-order auto-regressive process

201 ≤ t ≤ 300

(8)

X(t) = 0.7X(t − 1) + ξ

(9)

where ξ is an i.i.d. white noise with zero mean and variance σ2
ξ . Our results are
essentially the same when X is itself a white noise process. The two time series
are standardized before the construction of the distance matrix. Therefore,
there is only one parameter f , σξ/ση characterizing the signal-over-noise
ratio of the lead-lag relationship between X and Y . We use f = 1/5 in the
simulations presented below, corresponding to a weak signal-to-noise ratio.

Figure 2 compares the reconstructed lead-lag path x(t) when using ǫ− deﬁned
by (1), or ǫ+ deﬁned by (2), or ǫ± deﬁned by (3). If the method worked
perfectly, the lead-lag path x(t) would be equal to x(t) = +10 for 1 6 t 6 100,
x(t) = +5 for 101 6 t 6 200 and x(t) = −5 for 201 6 t 6 300. One can
observe that the new proposed distance ǫ± recovers the correct solution up to
moderate ﬂuctuations. Unsurprisingly, the lead-lag path reconstruction using
ǫ− gives the correct solution in the ﬁrst and third time intervals for which
the correlation is positive but is totally wrong with large ﬂuctuations in the
middle time interval in which the correlation is negative. Symmetrically, the
lead-lag path reconstruction using ǫ+ gives the correct solution in the middle
interval where the correlation is negative and is completely wrong with large
ﬂuctuations in the two other intervals. Actually, we verify (not shown) that
ǫ± reduces to mostly ǫ− in the ﬁrst and third interval and to ǫ+ in the middle
interval, as it should.

Figure 3 tests the robustness of the reconstructed lead-lag path using the
distance ǫ± with respect to diﬀerent choices of the temperature: T = 1, 0.2,
0.1, and 0.01. Recall that a vanishing temperature corresponds to selecting
the lead-lag path which has the minimum total sum of distances along its
length. At the opposite, a very large temperature corresponds to wash out the
information contained in the distance matrix and treat all paths on the same
footing. In between, a ﬁnite temperature allows us to average the contribution
over neightboring paths with similar energies, making the estimated lead-lag

path more robust to noise-like structures in the distance matrix due to noises
decorating the two time series. It is apparent that a too small temperature T =
0.01 leads to spurious large spiky ﬂuctuations around the correct solution. A
too large temperature T = 1 selects a thermally-averaged path which deviates
from the correct solution, here mostly at the beginning of the time series. It
seems that there is an optimal range of temperatures around T = 0.1 − 0.2
for which the correct solution is retrieved with minimal ﬂuctuations around
it. The existence of an optimal range of temperature is conﬁrmed in the inset
of Figure 3, which shows the root-mean-square (rms) deviations between the
reconstructed lead-lag path and the exact solution (x(t) = +10 for 1 ≤ t ≤
100, x(t) = +5 for 101 ≤ t ≤ 200 and x(t) = −5 for 201 ≤ t ≤ 300) as
a function of temperature in the range 0.01 ≤ T ≤ 10. The existence of a
well-deﬁned optimal range of temperatures is strongest for smaller signal-to-
noise ratios f , σξ/ση. For large f (weak noise), we observe that smaller
temperatures are better, as expected.

The whole purpose of the new distance ǫ± is to be able to identify, not only
the lead-lag structure better but also, the existence of possible negative corre-
lations as well as changes of the sign of the correlation with time. We identify
the sign s(t, x(t)) = s(t1, t2) of the cross-correlation of the two time series at
the times t1, t2 from the value of ǫ±: when ǫ± reduces to ǫ− (resp. ǫ+), we
conclude that the correlation is positive (resp. negative). The corresponding
algorithm for the sign of the cross-correlations is thus

causality). The ﬁltered signal S(t) is shown in Fig. 4. The results are quite
consistent with the model in which the correlation is negative in the middle

4 Historical volatilities of inﬂation rate and economic output rate

In this section, we apply our novel technique to the relationship between inﬂa-
tion and real economic output quantiﬁed by GDP in the hope of providing new
insights. This problem has attracted tremendous interests in past decades in
the macroeconomic literature. Diﬀerent theories have suggested that the im-
pact of inﬂation on the real economy activity could be either neutral, negative,
or positive. Based on the story of Mundell that higher inﬂation would lower
real output [21], Tobin argued that higher inﬂation causes a shift from money
to capital investment and raise output per capita [22], known as the Mundell-
Tobin eﬀect. On the contrary, Fischer suggested a negative eﬀect, stating that
higher inﬂation resulted in a shift from money to other assets and reduced
the eﬃciency of transactions in the economy due to higher search costs and
lower productivity [23]. In the middle ground, Sidrauski proposed a neutral
eﬀect where exogenous time preference ﬁxed the long-run real interest rate
and capital intensity [24]. These arguments are based on the rather restrictive
assumption that the Philips curve (inverse relationship between inﬂation and
unemployment), taken in addition to be linear, is valid. To evaluate which
model characterizes better real economic systems, numerous empirical eﬀorts
have been performed and the question is still open.

On the other hand, much focus is put on the nexus between inﬂation and
its uncertainty and economic activity. Okun made the hypothesis of a posi-
tive correlation between inﬂation and inﬂation uncertainty [25]. Furthermore,
Friedman argued that an increase in the uncertainty of future inﬂation reduces
the economic eﬃciency and lowers the real output rate [26], which is veriﬁed
empirically (see, e.g. [27,28,29,30,31,32]). Following the seminal work of Taylor
[33], the output-inﬂation variability trade-oﬀ has been tested extensively in the
literature, such as in [34,35,36,37,38], which are based on model speciﬁcation.
Liu and Liu analyzed the relation between the historical volatility of the out-
put and of the inﬂation rate, using Chinese data from 1992 to 2004 [19]. They
found that there is a strong correlation between the two volatilities and, what
is more interesting, that the rolling correlation coeﬃcient changes its sign. In
the following, we investigate the nexus between the historical volatilities of
inﬂation and output in a model-free manner to test for possible changes of the
signs of their cross-correlation structure.

The data sets, which were retrieved from the FRED II database, include
monthly consumer price index (CPI) for all urban consumers and seasonally
adjusted quarterly gross domestic product (GDP) covering the time period
from 1947 to 2005. The annualized rates of inﬂation rate rCPI and economic
growth rate rGDP were calculated on a quarterly basis from the CPI and GDP

10

respectively. The historical volatility is calculated in a rolling window as

where r = rCPI for inﬂation rate and r = rGDP for growth rate, and µ(t) is
their corresponding mean in the rolling window [t − ∆t + 1/4, t]. The unit
of t and ∆t is one year. The resulting historical volatility series νCPI(t) and
νGPD(t) are shown in the upper panel of Fig. 5 for the time period [1950, 1960],
with ∆t = 3 years. Since the volatility ν(t) is non-stationary (as shown by a
standard unit-root test), we use the ﬁrst-diﬀerence of volatility ∆ν(t), shown
in the lower panel of Fig. 5. We focus on the 10-year time period [1950, 1960]
only for a clearer visualization since the analysis and results are the same
qualitatively in other time periods.

Visual inspection of the lower panel of Fig. 5 suggests that the variations of
the volatilities νCPI(t) and νGPD(t) are approximately synchronous from 1951
to 1954 and then become approximately anti-phased from 1955 to 1958. Can
this be conﬁrmed or falsiﬁed by the technique proposed here? To address
this question, we determine the smoothed sign function S(t) determined as
explained at the end of the previous section. Our tests show that the lead-lag
path is close to the diagonal and that there is no signiﬁcant gain obtained by
allowing for a time-varying lag between the variations of the volatilities νCPI(t)
and νGPD(t). We thus calculate S(t) by smoothing the signal s(t) deﬁned
by (10) with the distance matrix constructed using deﬁnition (3) along the
diagonal of the plane (t1, t2) (in other words, for x(t) = 0). We again use the
causal Savitzky-Golay ﬁlter with a quadratic polynomial and NL data points

to the left of each time step t plus the point at t itself. As shown in Fig. 6, we
ﬁnd that the sign signal function S(t) is quite robust with respect to variations
of the smoothing parameter NL in the range NL = 5 − 15. For comparison,
we also plot in Fig. 6 the cross-correlation function C(t) in rolling windows of
three years.

Fig. 6. Determination of the sign of the correlation between the variations of the
volatilities νCPI(t) and νGPD(t) as a function of time in a running window of three
years. Our new method S(t) (triangles with three values of the smoothing parameter
NL) is compared with the cross-correlation C(t) in a running window of size equal
to three years (squares).

The reconstructed sign of the correlations between variations of the volatilities
νCPI(t) and νGPD(t) is in good agreement with and actually makes more precise
the visual impression mentioned above. In particular, one can observe that
the transition from a synchronicity to anti-phased was gradual with possible
ups and downs before the anti-correlation set in in 1956. In contrast, the
cross-correlation method suﬀers from a serious lack of reactivity, predicting a
change of correlation sign two years or so after it actually happened. We can
thus conclude that our new measure outperforms signiﬁcantly the traditional
cross-correlation measure for real-time identiﬁcation of switching of correlation
structures.

5 Concluding remarks

We have extended the thermal optimal path method [8,9] in order to, not only
identify the time-varying lead-lag structure between two time series but also,
to measure the sign of their cross-correlation. In so doing, the identiﬁcation
of the lead-lag structure is improved when there is the possibility for the sign

12

of their correlation to shift. In this goal, the main modiﬁcation of the method
previously introduced in Refs.[8,9] consists in generalizing the distance matrix
in such a way that both correlated and anti-correlated time series can be
matched optimally.

A synthetic numerical example has been presented to verify the validity of the
new method. Extensive numerical simulations have determined the existence
of an optimal range T ∼ (0.1, 1) of temperatures to use for the robust thermal
averaging. We have also proposed a new measure, the sign signal function
S(t), that allows us to identify the sign of the correlation structure between
two time series.

We have applied our new method to the investigation of possible shifts be-
tween synchronous to anti-phased variations of the historical volatility of the
USA inﬂation rate and economic growth rate. The two variables are found
positively correlated and in a synchronous state in the 1950’s except over the
time period from the last quarter of 1954 till around 1958, when they were
in a asynchronous phase (approximately anti-phased). While the traditional
cross-correlation function fails to capture this behavior, our new TOP method
provides a precise quantiﬁcation of these regime shifts.

The emphasis of this paper has been methodological. Extensions will investi-
gate the economic meaning of the change of correlation structures as shown
here. One possible candidate is the concept of shifts of convention, as discussed
in the introduction. More work on many more examples is needed to ascertain
the generality of these eﬀects. Overall, the development of better and more
precise quantitative tools is progressively unraveling a picture according to
which variability and changes of correlation structures is the rule rather than
the exceptions in macroeconomics and in ﬁnancial economics, in the spirit of
Aoki and Yoshikawa [39].

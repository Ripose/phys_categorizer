1 Introduction

In mathematics, the Golden Section is a geometric proportion created by a point C on a

segment of line AB when AC/AB=CB/AC, as shown in Fig. 1.

This ratio has the value Φ=0.618...

Since the times of antiquity many philosophers, artists and mathematicians have been

preoccupied by the Golden Section, which the writers of the Renaissance have called the

”Divine Proportion”. The mathematician Lucas Pacioli has characterized the Golden Sec-

tion as aesthetically satisfying and wrote on this theme the treaty ”Divina Proportione”.

It is largely accepted that a rectangle having the sides in this ratio has special aesthetic

qualities 1. Moreover the Golden Section has been used as an ideal proportion on which

the pattern of lines and shapes in the composition of a painting should be based. Taking

1

this idea as a point of departure in this paper was done a statistical study on a series of

paintings, belonging to various authors and from diﬀerent periods to see how the Golden

Section is applied in painting. The ratio between the sides of the paintings chosen by

these painters is regarded as the most appropriate and beautiful proportion. Let’s remark

that 1/P hi=1.618 is also related to the golden section by the relation 1/Φ = Φ + 1.

2 Statistical study of paintings

It was done a statistical study on 565 works of art of diﬀerent great painters: Bellini, Car-

avaggio, Cesanne2, Goya, van Gogh, Delacroix, Pallady (Romanian painter), Rembrandt,

Toulouse-Lautrec. It was calculated the ratio of the 2 dimensions of painting: the longer

part to the shorter part of the painted rectangle. In Table 1 are given the average values

and the errors of the average for the ratio of the sides for various paintings of the painters

studied. The paintings considered in this statistics have been selected from the speciﬁed

references, where the sides of the paintings have been indicated.

Assuming that all the painters under discussion enter in a statistics with equal weights, in

Fig. 2a is shown the total distribution, for the number of paintings N= 565. The average value

obtained for the ratio of the sides is

This value, determined experimentally, is the result of the intuitive choice of great creators of

art and is signiﬁcsantly diﬀerent from the value of the Golden Section 1/Φ=1.618, which is a

theoretical ratio, obtained from an abstract, mathematical theory, which supposedly ought to

impress on a painting a supreme harmony.

1.34 ± 0.12.

In Fig. 2b is illustrated the ratio L/l=1.34, lying on the maximum of the distribution, by the

painting of Toulouse-Lautrec, ”La Goulue entering at Moulin Rouge”, dated 1891-1892, Museum

of Modern Art from New York, having the dimensions 79.4 x 59 cm, and alongside this painting

it is drawn a rectangle whose sides are in the Golden Section.

Exact results for the Barab´asi model of human dynamics

Empirical evidence shows that the human activity patterns display a bursty dynamics, with
interevent times following a heavy tailed distribution. Recently it was proposed that this behavior
is rooted in the fact that humans assign their active tasks diﬀerent priorities, helping them to
decide what to do next. This process has been modeled as a queuing system with a ﬁx number
of active tasks [A.-L. Barab´asi, Nature 435, 207 (2005)]. In this work we obtain exact results for
the Barab´asi model of human dynamics by calculating the priority distribution of active tasks and
the task waiting time distribution for the case of two tasks. Using these results we prove that the
model has a singular behavior in the limit of a highest priority ﬁrst selection protocol, and derive
the scaling behavior in this limit. We also show that, independently of the selection protocol, the
average waiting time is smaller or equal than the number of active tasks, and discuss the possible
asypmtotic behavior of the waiting time distribution.

Several problems of practical interest require us to un-
derstand human activity patterns [1, 2, 3]. Typical exam-
ples are the design of telephone systems or web servers,
where it is critical to know how many users would use the
service simultaneously. The traditional approach to char-
acterize the timing of human activities is based in two
assumptions: the execution of each task is independent
from the others and each task is executed at a constant
rate [1, 2, 3, 4]. A speciﬁc task, such as sending emails
or making phone calls, is then modeled as a Poisson pro-
cess [4], characterized by a homogeneous activity pattern.
More precisely the time interval between two consecutive
executions of the task follows an exponential distribution.
An increasing amount of empirical evidence is indicating,
however, that human activity patterns are rather hetero-
geneous, with short periods of high activity separated by
long periods of inactivity [1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. This
heterogeneity is characterized by a heavy tail in the dis-
tribution of the time interval between two consecutive
executions of the given task [5, 10, 11].

In practice the execution of one task is not independent
for the others. Humans keep track of a list of active tasks
from where they decide what to do next, the selection
of one task implying the exclusion of the others. This
picture lead Barab´asi to model the task management by
a human as a queuing system, where the human plays
role of the server [5].

Queuing systems [12] have already received some at-
tention in the physics literature [13, 14, 15, 16, 17].
This interest is motivated by the observation of a non-
equilibrium phase transition from a non-congested phase
with a stationary number of active tasks to a congested
phase where the number of active tasks grows in time.
Morereover, in the non-congested phase the mean wait-
ing time before the execution of an active task is ﬁnite.
When approaching the phase transition point the mean
waiting time diverges, while it grows with time in the

congested phase.

The Barab´asi model belongs, however, to a new class of
queuing models where the number of active tasks is con-
stant. In this case the behavior of interest comes from
the task selection protocol. In the limit when the high-
est priority task is selected ﬁrst, numerical simulations
and heuristic arguments show that most of the tasks are
executed in one step, while the waiting time distribution
of tasks waiting more than one step exhibits a heavy tail
[5]. Yet, further research is required to obtain the scaling
behavior in the vicinity of this singular point.

In this work we obtain exact results for the Barab´asi
model, allowing us to prove previous conjectures based
on heuristic arguments and numerical simulations, and
creating a solid background for future research. In partic-
ular, we calculate the priority distribution of those tasks
remaining in the list and the waiting time probability dis-
tribution for the case of two active tasks. We corroborate
the observation of a singular behavior in the limit when
the task with the highest priority is selected ﬁrst, and
derive the corresponding scaling behavior. We also ob-
tain an upper bound for the average waiting time, which
is independent of the selection protocol. Based on this
result we discuss the possible asymptotic behaviors of
the waiting time distribution. All the results presented
here were checked by numerical simulations, providing a
perfect match with the theoretical curves.

Barab´asi model: The Barab´asi model is deﬁned as fol-
lows. A human keeps track of a list with L active tasks
that he/she must do. A priority x ≥ 0 is assigned to each
active task when it is added to the list, with a probability
density function (pdf) ρ(x). The list is started at t = 0
by adding L new tasks two it. At each discrete time step
t > 0, the task in the list with the highest priority is
selected with probability p, and with probability 1 − p
a task is selected at random. The selected task is exe-
cuted, removed from the list, and a new task is added.

The control parameter p interpolates between the ran-
dom selection protocol at p = 0 and the highest priority
ﬁrst selection protocol at p = 1.

The numerical simulations indicate that the case L = 2
already exhibits the relevant features of the model [5].
Furthermore, if we focus on a single task, such as send-
ing emails, we can model the active tasks list as a list
with two tasks, one correspoding to sending emails and
the other to doing something else. Within this scenario
the waiting time coincides with the time between two
consecutive executions of the corresponding task. Thus,
the L = 2 case provides us with a minimal model to
study the statistical properties of the time between the
consecutive execution of speciﬁc tasks.

Consider the Barab´asi model with L = 2. The task
that has been just selected and its priority has been
reassigned will be called the new task, while the other
task will be called the old task. Let ρ(x) and R(x) =
x
0 dx˜ρ(x) be the priority pdf and distribution function
of the new task, which are given. In turn, let ˜ρ(x, t) and
R
x
˜R(x, t) =
0 dx˜ρ(x, t) be the priority pdf and distribu-
tion function of the old task at the t-th step. At the
(t + 1)-th step, there are two tasks on the list, their pri-
orities being distributed according to R(x) and ˜R(x, t),
respectively. After selecting one task the old task will
have the distribution function

when p → 1 from (4) we obtain

(6)

i.e.
˜ρ(x) is concentrated around x = 0. This result
implies that in the limit p → 1 the new task will always be
selected for execution, resulting in a waiting time τ = 1.
We are going to return to this result after computing the
waiting time distribution. The progression between these
two limiting cases is illustrated in Fig. 1, where we plot
˜R(x) in (4) as a function of x for a uniform distribution in
0 ≤ x ≤ 1. As p increases from zero ˜R(x) deviates more
from R(x), resulting in a higher probability to obtain
smaller values of x. When p = 0.999, ˜R(x) grows to a
value of almost one in a very short x-range close to x = 0,
approaching the limit distribution (6).

Next we turn our attention to the waiting time dis-
tribution. Consider a task with priority x that has just
been added to the queue. The selection of this task is
independent from one step two the other. Therefore, the
probability that it waits τ steps is given by the product
of the probability that it is not selected in the ﬁrst τ − 1
steps and that it is selected in the τ -th step. The proba-
bility that it is not selected in the ﬁrst step is ˜q(x), while
the probability that it is not selected in the subsequent
steps is q(x). Integrating over the new task possible pri-

Note that Pτ is independent of the ρ(x) pdf from which
the tasks are selected from.
Indeed, what matters for
task selection is its relative order with respect to other
tasks, resulting that all dependences with x in (2)-(4)
and (7) appears via R(x).

As before, let of consider the limiting cases.

In this case almost all tasks have a waiting time τ = 1,
while the waiting time of tasks that are not selected in
the ﬁrst step follows a power law probability distribution.
This picture is illustrated by a direct plot of Pτ in (8).
In Fig. 2 we plot Pτ vs τ for a uniform distribution in
0 ≤ x ≤ 1. For p = 0.5 the probability distribution Pτ
is dominated by an exponential cutoﬀ. This exponential
cutoﬀ can be derived from (8) by taking the limit τ → ∞
with p ﬁxed, resulting in

(12)

When p → 1 we obtain that τ0 → ∞ and, therefore,
the exponential cutoﬀ is shifted to higher τ values, while
the power law behavior Pτ ∼ 1/τ becomes more evident.
The Pτ vs τ curve systematically shifts, however, to lower
values for τ > 1, indicating that this power law applies to
a vanishing task fraction (see Fig. 2 and (11)). In turn,
P1 → 1 when p → 1, as it is corroborated by the direct
plot of P1 as a function of p (see Fig. 3).

Another characteristic magnitude of a queuing system
is the average waiting time of an active task before its ex-
ecution. For L = 2 we can calculate the average waiting
time directly from (8), obtaining

2 , 0 ≤ p < 1
1 , p = 1 .

hτ i =

(cid:26)

(13)

This average is restricted to those tasks that are executed
and, therefore, for p = 1 we are excluding the task that
remains indeﬁnitely in the queue. As we show next, we
can extend this result for L > 2 using simple arguments.
On each step there are L task in the queue and one of

them is executed. Therefore

For 0 ≤ p < 1 the numerical simulations indicate that all
active tasks are expected to be executed [5]. Therefore
hτ ′i ≤ hτ i and the last term in (15) vanishes when t →
∞. In contrast, for p = 1 the numerical simulations [5]
indicate that after some transient time the most recently
added task is always executed, while L − 1 tasks remain
indeﬁnitely in the queue. In this case τ ′
i ∼ t when t → ∞
and the last term in (15) is of the order of L − 1 when
t → ∞. Based on these arguments we conjecture that
the average waiting time of executed tasks is given by

L , 0 ≤ p < 1
1 , p = 1 ,

hτ i =

(cid:26)

(16)

which we proved for L = 2 (13), and it is corroborated
by the numerical simulations for L ≥ 2 (see Fig. 4).

It is important to note that the equality in (15) is in-
dependent of the selection protocol, allowing us to reach
conclusions that apply beyond the Barab´asi model. From
(15) we obtain

4

where τ0 > 0 and f (x) = O(bxα−2) when x → ∞, where
b is a constant. For instance, for the Barab´asi model
with L = 2 and 0 ≤ p < 1, α = 1 and f (x) decays
exponentialy (11).

The empirical evidence [5, 10, 11] is in favor of the
second scenario with α = 1. This observation is in agree-
ment with our expectation of a natural cutoﬀ. For in-
stance, we might go on a trip and not check emails for
several days, but sooner or later we are going to do it
because we receive and transmit important information
using this communication media. This cutoﬀ time is ex-
pected to be more related to the necessity of performing
a given task rather than to the interaction with other
tasks. In this sense, the random selection of a task in the
Barab´asi model could be interpreted as a task whose pri-
ority suddenly increases to the maximum value because
the need to execute it after being on the queue for a long
time. This indicates future directions of research, con-
sidering the case when the priority of old tasks may also
change with time.

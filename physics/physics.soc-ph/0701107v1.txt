Abstract. We describe and develop three recent novelties in network research which are
particularly useful for studying social systems. The ﬁrst one concerns the discovery of some
basic dynamical laws that enable the emergence of the fundamental features observed in
social networks, namely the nontrivial clustering properties, the existence of positive degree
correlations and the subdivision into communities. To reproduce all these features we describe
a simple model of mobile colliding agents, whose collisions deﬁne the connections between
the agents which are the nodes in the underlying network, and develop some analytical
considerations. The second point addresses the particular feature of clustering and its
relationship with global network measures, namely with the distribution of the size of cycles
in the network. Since in social bipartite networks it is not possible to measure the clustering
from standard procedures, we propose an alternative clustering coefﬁcient that can be used
to extract an improved normalized cycle distribution in any network. Finally, the third point
addresses dynamical processes occurring on networks, namely when studying the propagation
of information in them. In particular, we focus on the particular features of gossip propagation
which impose some restrictions in the propagation rules. To this end we introduce a quantity,
the spread factor, which measures the average maximal fraction of nearest neighbors which
get in contact with the gossip, and ﬁnd the striking result that there is an optimal non-trivial
number of friends for which the spread factor is minimized, decreasing the danger of being
gossiped.

Social networks: models and measures

1. Introduction

Contrary to what may be perceived at a ﬁrst glance, social and physical models were brought
together several times, during the last four centuries. In fact, not only Maxwell and Boltzmann
were inspired by the statistical approaches in social sciences to develop the kinetic theory of
gases, but one can even cite the English philosopher Thomas Hobbes, who already in the
seventeenth century, using a mechanical approach, tried to explain how people acquaintances
and behaviors may contribute to the evolution towards a stable absolute monarchy[1, 2]. More
than making a historical perspective if these approaches were successful and correct or not, it
is almost unquestionable that, at a certain level, there are social phenomena that could be more
deeply understood by using approaches of statistical and physical models. Recently[3, 4, 5],
this perspective gained considerable strength from the increased interest on - and in several
senses well-succeed - network approach, where one describes complex systems by mapping
them on a graph (network) of nodes and links and studies their structure and dynamics with the
help of some statistical and topological tools from statistical physics and graph theory[6, 7].
When addressing the speciﬁc case of a social system, nodes represent individuals and
the connections between them represent social relations and acquaintances of a certain kind.
Social networks were studied in different contexts[8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], ranging from
epidemics spreading and sexual contacts to language evolution and vote elections. However,
although they are ubiquitous, social networks differ from most other networks, yielding a still
broad spectrum of unanswered questions and improvements to be done when studying their
statistical and topological properties. In this paper, we will address three fundamental open
questions related to the typical structure and dynamics associated to social networks.

The ﬁrst open question has to do with the modeling of social networks. The recent
broad study of empirical social networks has shown that they have three fundamental
features common to all of them[15]. First, they present the small-world effect[16] with
small average path lengths between nodes and high clustering coefﬁcients meaning that
neighbors tend to be connected with each other. Second, they have positive correlations:
the highly (poorly) connected nodes tend to connected to other highly (poorly) connected
nodes. Third and last, invariably one observes an organization of the network into some
subsets of nodes (communities) more densely connected between each other. Although there
are arguments pointing out that all these features could be consequence from one another[15],
the modeling of speciﬁc social networks reproducing quantitatively all these features has not
been successful. Using a recent approach to construct networks, based on a system of mobile
agents, it is possible to reproduce all these features. In Section 2 we will further show that the
degree distributions characterizing social networks typically follow a speciﬁc one-parameter
distribution, so-called Brody distribution.

The second question is related to the intrinsic nature of the nodes. For certain social
networks there are intrinsic features of the individuals which must be considered in the
analysis. For instance, the gender in networks of sexual contacts[14] or the hierarchical
position in a network of social contacts inside some enterprise. From the network point of
view this distinction means to introduce multipartivity in the network, biasing the preferential

attachment between nodes that tend to connect with nodes of a certain type. When there
are two types of nodes, e.g. men and women, and the connections between them is strongly
related to this type, e.g. men can only match women and vice-versa, the standard measures to
analyze network structure fails. In particular, the standard clustering coefﬁcient[16], is unable
to quantify the connectedness of broader neighborhoods that typically appear in multipartite
networks. In Sec. 3 we will revisit some of the clustering coefﬁcients used to study clustering
in bipartite networks, and show how the combination of both clustering coefﬁcients can
yield good estimates of normalized cycle distributions. Moreover, we will discuss a general
theoretical picture of a global measure of increasing order of clustering coefﬁcients according
to some suitable expansion.

The third open question has to do with the heterogeneity of nodes in what concerns their
inﬂuence in the connections and therefore in the propagation phenomena on social networks.
In rumor propagation[17], for instance, one usually treats all connections equally in the spread
of some signal (opinion, rumor, etc). This is a suitable assumption for situations like the
spread of an opinion which is equally interesting to all nodes in the network, for example
political opinions to some vote election. However, there are also several social situations
where the signal is not equally interesting to all nodes, as the case of spreading of some
gossip about some common friend. In these cases there are connections which will be more
probably used to spread the signal than others, since not all our friends are also friends of the
particular person which is being gossiped about and therefore, either we tend to not tell the
gossip to them or they tend to not spread it even if they hear it. In Sec. 4 we will present a
simple model for gossip propagation and describe some striking features. Namely, that there
is an optimal number of friends, depending on the degree distribution and degree correlations
of the entire network, for which the danger to be gossiped is minimized.

Finally, in Sec. 5 we make ﬁnal conclusions, giving an overview of future questions
which could be studied in social networks arising from the topics studied throughout the
paper.

2. Modeling social networks: an approach based on mobile agents

Since the study of social networks is mainly concerned with topological and statistical features
of people’s acquaintances[8, 9], the modeling of such networks has been done within the
framework of graph theory using suitable probabilistic laws for the distribution of connections
between individuals[3, 4, 5, 7]. This approach proved to be successful in several contexts, for
instance to describe community formation[18, 19] and their growth[20].

However, they present two major drawbacks. First, the graph approach may be suited to
describe the structure of social contacts and acquaintances, but lacks to give insight into the
social dynamical laws underlying it. Second, these models seem to be unable to reproduce all
the main features characteristic of social networks, at least at the fundamental level. In this
context, it was pointed out that[21, 22, 23] dynamical processes based on local information
should be also considered when modeling the network. Our recent proposal to overcome these
shortcomings was to construct networks, from a system of mobile agents following a simple

Figure 1. Illustration of the two-dimensional mobile agents system. Initially there are no
connections between nodes and nodes move with some initial velocity v0 in a randomly chosen
direction (arrows). At t = 1 two nodes, P1 and P2 collide and a connection between them is
introduced (solid line), velocities are updated increasing their magnitude and choosing a new
random direction. At t = 2 two other collisions occur, between nodes P2 and P4 and between
nodes P1 and P3. In this way a network of nodes and connections between them emerges as a
straightforward consequence of their motion (see text).

motion law[13, 14]. Here, we brieﬂy review this model and further present the analytical
expression that ﬁts the obtained degree distributions. In particular we show that the degree
distribution typically follows a Brody distribution[24].

2.1. The model

The model is given by a system of particles (agents) that move and collide with each other,
forming through those collisions the acquaintances between individuals. Consequently, the
network results directly from the time evolution of the system and is parameterized by two
single parameters, the density ρ of agents characterizing the system composition and the
maximal residence time Tℓ controlling its evolution. Each agent i is characterized by its
number ki of links and by its age Ai. When initialized each agent has a randomly chosen
age, position and moving direction with velocity v0 and one sets ki = 0. While moving,
the individuals follow ballistic trajectories till they collide. As a ﬁrst approximation we
assume that social contacts do not determine which social contact will occur next. Therefore,
after collisions, the total momentum should not be conserved, with the two agents choosing
completely random new moving directions. Figure 1 sketches consecutive stages of the
evolution of such a system of mobile agents.

Assuming that large number of acquaintances tend to favor the occurrence of new

contacts, the velocity should increase with degree k, namely

~v(ki) = (¯vkα

i + v0)~ω,

Figure 2. Bridging between real social networks with average degree hki and the system of
mobile agents that reproduce their topological and statistical features. In (a) the normalized
maximal residence time of agents is plotted as a function of the average degree, while in (b)
one plots the collision rate λ which is a unique function of the residence time, and scales with
hki.

where ¯v = 1 m/s is a constant to assure dimensions of velocity, ~ω = (~ex cos θ + ~ey sin θ)
with θ a random angle and ~ex and ~ey are unit vectors. The exponent α in Eq. (1) controls
the velocity update after each collision. Here, we consider α = 1. Further, the removal of
agents considered here is simply imposed by some threshold Tℓ in the age of the agents: when
Ai = Tℓ agent i leaves the system and a new agent j replaces it with kj = 0, vj = v0 and
randomly chosen moving direction. The selected values for Tℓ must be of the order of several
times the characteristic time τ between collisions, in order to avoid either premature death
of nodes. Too large values of Tℓ are also inappropriate since in that case each node may on
average collide with all other nodes yielding a fully connected network.

Similarly to other systems[25, 26], this ﬁnite Tℓ enables the entire system to reach a
non-trivial quasi-stationary state[13]. In fact, only by tuning Tℓ within an acceptable range
of small density values, one reproduces networks of social contacts.
In Fig. 2a one sees
the normalized residence time Tℓ/τ as a strictly monotonic function of the average degree
hki. From the residence time it is also possible to deﬁne a collision rate, as the fraction
between the average residence time Tℓ − hA(0)i = Tℓ/2 and the characteristic time τ , namely
λ = Tℓ/(2τ ) = hviTℓ/(2v0τ0), where τ0 is the characteristic time of the system at the
beginning when all agents have velocity v0. Figure 2b shows clearly that λ = 2hki.

By looking at Fig. 2 one now understands the main strength of the mobile agent model
here described: when taking a real network of social contacts and measuring the average
degree hki the correspondence sketched in Fig. 2 straightforwardly returns the suitable value
of Tℓ that reproduces the topological and statistical features.

It was already reported[13, 27] that empirical networks extracted from a survey among
84 American schools are easily reproduced with this mobile agent model, in what concerns the
degree distribution, second-order correlations, community structure, average path length and
clustering coefﬁcient. As an illustration, Fig. 3 shows the degree distribution P (k) of nine of
such schools (symbols). Such distributions are well ﬁtted by Brody distributions (solid lines)

special constants, the product of a power of k with an exponential with a negative exponent

This guarantees that distribution in Eq. (2) has indeed one single parameter. How such a
distribution can be obtained from an analytical approach to the model of mobile agents is still
an open question and will be discussed in detail elsewhere.

3. Particular measures for social networks

To measure “the cliquishness of a typical neighborhood” in a network, Watts and Strogatz [16]
introduced a simple coefﬁcient, called the clustering coefﬁcient, which counts the number
of pairs of neighbors of a certain node which are connected with each other, forming a
cycle of size s = 3. While such tool enables one to access the structure of complex
networks arising in many systems [4, 7], helping to characterize small-world networks [16],
to understand synchronization in scale-free networks of oscillators [28] and to characterize
chemical reactions [29] and networks of social relationships [30, 31], there are other situations
where this measure does not suit. Namely, when the network presents a multipartite structure.
For instance, when there are two different kinds of nodes and connections link only nodes of
different type, the network is bipartite[30, 31, 32] and the bipartite structure does not allow
the occurrence of cycles with odd size, in particular with s = 3.

Bipartite networks are quite common for social systems[32, 33] where the two different
kinds of nodes represent e.g. the two genders. While the standard clustering coefﬁcient in such
networks is always zero, they have in general non vanishing clustering properties[31] and
therefore more appropriate quantities to access such networks have been proposed, namely
In this Section, we will discuss how these different
coefﬁcients counting larger cycles.
clustering coefﬁcients are related to each other and how one can use them to improve the
knowledge of the network structure.

The standard clustering coefﬁcient C3 is usually deﬁned[16] as the fraction between the
number of cycles of size s = 3 (triangles) observed in the network out of the total number of
possible triangles which may appear, namely

C3(i) =

2ti
ki(ki − 1)

.

(4)

where ti is the number of existing triangles containing node i and ki is the number of neighbors
of node i, yielding a maximal number ki(ki − 1)/2 of triangles.

To access the cliquishness in bipartite networks one has proposed[21, 31, 32, 34] a
clustering coefﬁcient C4(i), sometimes called the grid coefﬁcient[34], deﬁned as the quotient

Social networks: models and measures

between the number of cycles of size s = 4 (squares) and the total number of possible squares.
Explicitly, for a given node i with two neighbors, say m and n, this coefﬁcient yields[21]

C4,mn(i) =

qimn
(km − ηimn)(kn − ηimn) + qimn

,

where qimn is the number of common neighbors between m and n (not counting i) and
ηimn = 1 + qimn + θmn with θmn = 1 if neighbors m and n are connected with each other and
0 otherwise.

After averaging over the nodes, the coefﬁcients C3 and C4 characterize the contribution

be a suitable quantity to measure the cliquishness of bipartite networks compared to their
monopartite counterparts, C4 must behave the same way as C3 when the network parameters
are changed, as it is indeed the case for hC4i computed from Eq. (5). See Ref. [21] for details.
One should notice that in most m-partite networks, it is always possible to have cycles
of size s = 4, indicating that C4 is in some sense a more general clustering measure than C3.
However, it could be the case that for a larger number of partitions forming the network, the
contribution of larger cycles increases. This is the case, for instance, of trophic relations in
an ecological network of different individuals from different species, where large cycles tend
to be abundant, namely the ones ranging from the higher predators to the plants at the lowest
trophic level. In such cases, a general clustering coefﬁcient counting the fraction of possible
cycles of arbitrary size n may be needed. The generalization is straightforward yielding a
clustering coefﬁcient Cn = En/Ln, where En is the number of existing cycles with size n,
Ln the maximal number of such cycles that is possible to be attained and n = 3, . . . , N for a
network of N nodes.

Having Cn for the required values of n, one is able to introduce a general clustering

measure of the network, given by the sum of all these contributions, namely

From Eq. (7) one can assume approximately that En ∼ (hP ihqiN)n with hP i and hqi the
average fractions of P (k) and q(k1, k2) respectively. Since Ln increases also as N n, a possible
suitable choice for α would be a constant, namely α = 1/(N − 2) obeying the normalization

condition above. Having presented this general scenario, we now concentrate on the two ﬁrst
clustering coefﬁcients, C3 and C4, to address the cycle size distribution.

We ﬁrst show an estimate introduced in Ref. [35], which considers only the degree
distribution P (k) and the distribution of the standard clustering coefﬁcient C3(k). One starts
by considering the set of cycles with a central node, i.e. cycles with one node connected to
all other nodes composing the cycle, as illustrated in Fig. 5a. The central node composes
one triangle with each pair of connected neighbors. Due to this fact, the number of cycles
with size s can be easily estimated, since the number of different possible cycles to occur is
n0(s, k) = Bk
, for a central node with k neighbors and the corresponding fraction of
these cycles which is expected to occur is p0(s, k) = C3(k)s−2, yielding a total number of
s-cycles given by

where gs is a factor which takes into account the number of cycles counted more than once.

The estimate in Eq. (9) is a lower bound for the total number of cycles since it considers
only cycles with a central node. Further, this estimate only accounts for cycles up to size
s ≤ kmax + 1, with kmax the maximal degree and is not suited for bipartite networks where
C3(k) = 0 for all k. Bipartite networks are typically composed of a set of nodes as those
illustrated in Fig. 5c, where no central node exists.

By using additionally the coefﬁcient C4(k) in a similar estimate, one is now able to take
into account several cycles without central nodes. One ﬁrst considers the set of cycles of size
s with one node connected to all the others except one, as illustrated in Fig. 5b. Assuming
that this node has k neighbors, s − 2 of them belonging to the cycle one is counting for, one
has n1(s, k) = Bk
s−2(s − 2)!/2 different possible cycles of size s. The corresponding fraction
of such cycles which is expected to occur is given by p1(s, k) = C3(k)s−4C4(k)(1 − C3(k)).
Writing an equation similar to Eq. (9), where instead of n0(s, k) and p0(s, k) one has n1(s, k)
and p1(s, k) respectively and the sum starts at s − 2 instead of s − 1, one has an additional
number N ′

s of estimated cycles which is not considered in estimate (9).

To improve the estimate further one repeats the same approach, taking out each time
one connection to the initial central node, increasing by one the number of elementary cycles
of size s = 4. Figure 5c illustrates a cycle of size s = 6 composed by two elementary

where [x] denotes the integer part of x. In particular, the ﬁrst term (q = 0) is the sum in Eq. (9)
and the upper limit [s/2] − 1 of the ﬁrst sum is obtained by imposing the exponent of C3(k)
in pq(s, k) to be non-negative.

The estimate in Eq. (10) not only improves the estimated number computed from Eq. (9),
but also enables the estimate of cycles up to a larger maximal size[21], namely up to
s = 2kmax where kmax is the maximal number of neighbors in the network.

The estimate in Eq. (10) has also the advantage of being able to estimate cycles in
bipartite networks. Since for bipartite networks C3(k) = 0, all terms in Eq. (10) vanish
except those for which the exponent of C3(k) is zero, i.e. for s = 2(q + 1) with q an integer,
which naturally shows the absence of cycles of odd size in such networks.

For highly connected networks, both estimates should nevertheless yield similar results,
since in that case there is a very large number of both triangles and squares. For instance,
the so-called pseudo-fractal network[36] is a deterministic scale-free network, constructed

from three initial nodes connected with each other (generation m = 0), and iteratively adding
new generations of nodes such that in generation m + 1 one new node is added to each
edge of generation m and is connected to the two nodes joined by that edge. For these
networks, the exact number of cycles with size s can be written iteratively [37] and can be
directly compared to the one obtained with the two estimates above. Figure 6a shows the
two estimates, while in Fig. 6b the exact number is computed. We notice that both the real
number Ns of cycles and the normalized value Ns/(Ngs), though different, yield the same
shape. Thus, although the estimates above are not able to explicit the geometrical factor gs,
the corresponding normalized distributions agree very well with the real one. However, while
in this simple situation both estimates are similar, in general they can deviate signiﬁcantly, as
illustrated in Fig. 6c. In such cases, the estimate (10) is closer to the real distribution of cycle
sizes[21].

4. Spreading phenomena in social networks

In the previous Section we show how the study of network structure can be addressed by
using tools as the clustering coefﬁcient and ﬁrst and second degree distributions. However,
although the ability to communicate within a network of contacts is favored by the network
topology[38], to study dynamical phenomena occurring on the network other measures are
necessary. Here, we focus on novel properties that help to ascertain the broadness and speed
of propagating phenomena through the network. We will describe two helpful quantities to
study propagation in a network. As we will see these tools are particularly suited for a simple
model of gossip propagation, that yields a striking result: in real social systems it is possible
to minimize the risk of being gossiped, by only choosing an optimal number of friendship
acquaintances.

We start by introducing the additional quantities in the context of gossip propagation. As
opposed to rumors, a gossip always targets the details about the behavior or private life of
a speciﬁc person. Some information of a speciﬁc gossip is created at time t = 0 about the
victim by one of its neighbors. Since typically the gossip tends to be of interest to only those
who know the victim personally, we consider ﬁrst that it only spreads at each time step from
the vertices that know the gossip to all vertices that are connected to the victim and do not
yet know the gossip. Our dynamics is therefore like a burning algorithm [39], starting at the
originator and limited to sites that are neighbors of the victim. The gossip will spread until all
reachable neighbors of the victim know it, yielding a spreading time τ .

To measure how effectively the gossip or more generally the amount of information
attains the neighbors of the starting node (victim), we deﬁne the spreading factor f given
by

f = nf /k

(11)

where nf is the total number of the k neighbors who eventually hear the gossip in a network
with N vertices (individuals). Although similar in particular cases, the spreading factor f and
the clustering coefﬁcient are, in general, different because the later one only measures the

the Apollonian (n = 9 generations) and (b) the Barab´asi-Albert network with N = 104 nodes
for m = 3 (circles), 5 (squares) and 7 (triangles), where m is the number of edges of a new
site, and averaged over 100 realizations. In the inset of (a) we show a schematic design of the
Apollonian lattice for n = 3 generations. Fitting Eq. (12) to these data we have B = 1.1 in
(a) and B = 5.6 for large k in (b).

number of bonds between neighbors giving no insight about how they are connected.

In Fig. 7 one sees how the spreading time τ depends on the degree k of the starting
node. The Apollonian network[40] is illustrated in Fig. 7a, while the case of Barab´asi-Albert
networks is given in Fig. 7b. In both cases τ clearly grows logarithmically,

τ = A + Blogk,

(12)

In the case of the Apollonian network, one can even derive this behavior
for large k.
analytically as follows. In order to communicate between two vertices of the n-th generation,
one needs up to n steps, which leads to τ ∝ n. Since for the Apollonian network one has[40]
k = 3 × 2n−1, one immediately obtains that τ ∝ logk.

For the Apollonian network all neighbors of a given victim are connected in a closed path
surrounding the victim, as can be seen from the inset of Fig. 7a, yielding f = 1. This stresses
the fact that the spread factor f is rather different from the clustering coefﬁcient which in this
case is C = 0.828 [40].

Next, we will show that for these two features to appear one needs the existence of
degree correlations between connected nodes, as usually observed in real empirical networks.
In Fig. 8 we plot the results of gossip spreading on an empirical set of networks extracted
from survey data[41] in 84 U.S. schools. Here, the logarithmic growth of τ with k, shown in
Fig. 8a, follows the same dependence of the average degree knn of the nearest neighbors[42],
as illustrated in the inset. As in the case of the BA networks, we also ﬁnd for the schools a
characteristic degree k0 for which f and therefore the gossip spreading is smallest. The inset
of Fig. 8b, however, gives clear evidence that the school networks are not scale-free. Since
the same optimal degree appears in Barab´asi-Albert networks, one argues that the existence
of this optimal number is not necessarily related to the degree distribution of the network, but

rather to the degree correlations.

However, the relation between degree correlations, measured by knn, and the logarithmic
behavior of the spreading time is not straightforward. While in the empirical network we
found the same distribution for both knn and τ , in BA and APL networks knn follows a
power-law with k (not shown). As for the spread factor f , a mean ﬁeld approach can
be derived, yielding an f -rate equation which depends in general on P (k) and two and
three-point correlations of the degree. In the case of uncorrelated networks, two and three-
point correlations reduce to simple expressions of the moments of the degree distribution.
Therefore, f is independent of the degree, similarly to what is observed for the density of
particles as derived by Catanzaro et al[43] in diffusion-annihilation processes on complex
networks. For correlated networks, as the empirical network here studied, the analytical
approach is not straightforward and will be presented elsewhere.

Another quantity of interest is the distribution P (τ ) of spreading times, which clearly
decays exponentially for the Apollonian network, as illustrated in Fig. 9a. This behavior
can be also obtained analytically by considering that P (τ )dτ = P (k)dk and using Eq. (12)
together with the degree distribution, P (k) ∝ k−γ, to obtain

P (τ ) ∝ eτ (1−γ)/B,

(13)

for large k. The slope in Fig. 9a is precisely (1 − γ)/B = −0.17 using B from Fig. 7a and
γ = 2.58 from Ref. [40]. For the school network, P (τ ) follows also an exponential decay for
large τ , but with a 3.5 times smaller characteristic decay time, and has a maximum for small
τ , as seen in Fig. 9b (circles). Compared to the P (τ ) of the Barab´asi-Albert network with
m = 9 (solid line), the shapes are similar but the Barab´asi-Albert case is slightly shifted to
the right, due to the larger minimal number of connections.

Many other regimes of gossip and of propagation phenomena can be also addressed with
these two quantities. Namely, a more realistic scenario could be addressed by enabling each

node to transfer information with a probability 0 ≤ p ≤ 1. Further, the assumption that
the person to which a gossip did not spread at the ﬁrst attempt, will never get it, yields a
regime similar to percolation conditional to the neighborhood of the victim. Differently, if at
each time-step the neighbors which already know the gossip repeatedly try to spread it to the
common friends, one observes the same value of f measured for q = 1, and the spreading
time scales as τ ′ ∼ τ /q, where τ is measured for q = 1. Finally, other possible regimes
comprehend the situation where the gossip spreading over strangers, i.e. over nodes which are
not directly connected to the victim. Such cases are being studied in detail and results will be
presented elsewhere[44].

5. Discussion and conclusions

In this paper we presented and developed recent achievements in social network research,
concerning the modeling of empirical networks, and speciﬁc mathematical tools to address
their structure and dynamical processes on them.

Concerning the modeling of empirical networks, we described brieﬂy a recent approach
based on a system of mobile agents. Further developments were given, namely in what
concerns the analytical expression which ﬁts the typical degree distributions observed in
empirical social networks. We gave evidence that such distributions follow a Brody
distribution which depends on a single parameter that scales with the average degree of the
network. A question which now remains to be answered is how to derive such distribution
from an analytical and meaningful approach.

Showing that

the usual clustering coefﬁcient

inappropriate when
addressing the clustering properties of social networks, we described a suitable measure to
access these properties and presented its additional applications for estimating the distribution
of cycles of higher order. This additional clustering coefﬁcient was also put in a general
framework with different other higher-order coefﬁcients, that could be useful for particular

situations of multipartite networks. An expansion combining all possible coefﬁcients was
also proposed, motivated by previous works[4], which depends only on the degree distribution
and degree-degree correlations. However, computational effort to compute such coefﬁcients
increases exponentially with their order and therefore it is not yet clear how useful such an
expansion may be.

Finally, to study dynamical processes in social networks, in particular the propagation of
information, two simple measures were introduced. Namely, a spread factor, which measures
the maximal relative size of the neighborhood reached, when the information starts from a
local source (node), and a spreading time, which gives the number of sufﬁcient steps to reach
such maximal size. This two measures gave rise to introduce a minimal model for gossip
propagation, which can be seen as a particular model of opinions. Within this speciﬁc model,
the spread factor was found to be minimized by a particular non-trivial degree of the source,
which is related to the degree-degree correlations arising in the network. If such possibility
of minimizing the danger of being gossiped can be tested in a real situation and which other
implications these ﬁndings have in other situations - e.g. in internet virus propagation - remain
open questions for forthcoming studies.

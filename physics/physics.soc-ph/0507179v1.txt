Abstract

We present a simple model for growing up and depletion of parties due to the permanent com-

munication between the participants of the events. Because of the rapid exchange of information,

everybody is able to evaluate its own and and all other parties by means of the list of its friends.

Therefore the number of participants at diﬀerent parties can be changed incessantly. Depending

on the deepness of the social contacts, which will be characterized by a parameter α, a stable

distribution of party members emerges. At a critical αc an abrupt depletion of almost all parties is

observed and as the consequence all the peoples are assembled at a single party. The model is based

on a hierarchical social network. The probability that a certain person is contacted to another one

depends on the social distance introduced within the network and homophily parameter α.

INTRODUCTION

Finding of groups of alike elements in data and in interests is of great importance in all

quantitative sciences. Thereby methods and tools of theoretical physics turned out to be

successful in giving new insight into the complex behavior in diﬀerent situations. Models

developed in statistical physics proved to be fruitful in reproducing and predicting features of

traﬃc [1], migration problems [2] as well as in opinion formation within social groups [3, 4].

Although the modeling of opinion formation, based on application of cellular automata,

Ising models and other tools of computational physics, is a quite drastic simpliﬁcation of

complicated cognitive processes, the general properties of the system will be reﬂected [5].

The main goal of the paper dealing with opinion formation, for a review see [5], are interested

to ﬁgure out a complete consensus or a diversity of ﬁnal opinions from initially diverging

opinion. As a further simpliﬁcation some authors [3, 6] have used a binary choice for opinions.

Thus, in the Sznajd model [6], two people sharing the same opinion tend to convince its (six)

neighbors of the pair opinion. A generalization of the model including advertising and aging

in a multilayer Sznajd model is discussed in [7]. Another related topic is the ghetto formation

studied by means of the two-dimensional Ising model with Kawasaki-exchange dynamics [8].

An extension to multi-cultural societies is discussed recently in [9]. A further enlargement

of the model is emerged by allowing many discrete opinions on a network [10, 11]. Hereby

the analysis is based on a directed network due to Albert and Barab´asi [12], for a discussion

of networks see also [13].

Our paper is likewise addressed to a relation between networks and dynamics of social

groups. In particular, we study diﬀerent individuals within a social group with conﬂicting

interests. Diﬀerent to other approaches the conﬂicts may also occur during the time evolution

and not only initially, e. g. physically the interaction is time-dependent. To be speciﬁc, let us

consider young peoples, planning to participate in a common Saturday party. However they

are indecisive at which party they will attend. To make a decision they are forced to establish

everlasting contacts to the other members of the society under consideration. Due to the

permanent contacts the actual decision of each member is modiﬁed permanently. Insofar,

we consider a dynamical, time dependent interaction between the members of the group.

Obviously, the characterized situation corresponds to the reality where the peoples taking

part at a certain party are often bored by the audience of that party. As a consequence

2

they decide to leave the present party and to orient towards another one. The change-over

to another party is normally triggered by the number of friends attendant at that party.

The goal of the present paper is to model such a situation. Speciﬁcally, we are interested in

depletion of all parties with exception of one party, reported in a German news magazine

[14]. Such a kind of phase transition is also observed in a class of models when a strong

leader and external impact are present [3]. In our model the phase transition is due to self-

organization eﬀects and is not controlled by external environment. Instead of that we have

introduced a hierarchical social network discussed recently by Watts et al [15]. This network

captures the essential ingredients of a network model of connected population [12, 16, 17, 18].

The construction of such kind of networks is motivated by the observation that individuals

within a certain population may be grouped according to their function in the society,

for example, their hobby, their occupation, etc. The model oﬀers the phenomena of “six

degree of separation” discovered by Travers and Milgram some years ago [19]. Recently

the spreading of epidemics within a hierarchical network has been discussed [20]. Here, we

analyze a party model on a hierarchical social network under a permanent self-organized

interaction between the agents.

II. THE MODEL

A. The Society

Let us characterize the situation we are interested in by a group of predominantly young

peoples willing to organize some events like parties. However, they are not up to visit any

party. Instead of that their aim is to ﬁnd out the “best” party at the evening. To decide

what the best party is, the peoples communicate permanently with their friends getting

stuck at any party. Due to everlasting exchange of opinions by mobile phone everyone is

well informed about the status of any party. Each member of the social group standing

about such an event is able to evaluate its own party by comparison with other ones. Based

on the permanent ability getting the total information, everybody decides on its stay at the

present party or to change the party. The decision is strongly inﬂuenced by the behavior

of subgroups which we identify with the circle of friends. In that sense our model is also

a stochastic one because the members of the group make their decision, the disposition to

3

change the party stochastically. This kind of emergent behavior is characteristic for a social

group and hence, there is an evidence to adopt method of statistical mechanics. Hereby, the

ensemble is given by a certain group the members of which are linked by common interests

such as to arrange parties. They form a social network within the society. The permanent

exchange of information and the subsequent decision to change the party or to stay at the

party is related to the interaction between the constituents. Thereby, the distribution of

parties with diﬀerent attractiveness oﬀers an additional interaction for the members of the

social group under consideration. To be more speciﬁc, let us assume the group consists of

N persons where all the friends should be included. Further, the systems contains V nodes

and E ⊆ V × V edges. The network is characterized by the numbers (V, E). The nodes

xi ∈ V represents the agents or the persons of the game, whereas the edges between the

nodes stands for the connections or the acquaintances between the persons. Additionally,

each node xi is assigned to a set of neighbors yi

γ with i ∈ [1, N] and γ = 1, . . . , k. This set

is called the friends. The single adjacency list, denoted by Ai → (yi
the pairs (xi, yi

k), consists of all
k) ∈ E with i ∈ [1, N]. The number k is identiﬁed as the
degree of the set xi. Each adjacency list A = {Ai} presents one realization of the network.

B. Hierarchical Networks

Following the basic idea by Watts et al [15] let us introduce a hierarchical network. The

model was motivated by the general structure in the groupings of individuals in a society.

Such a classiﬁcation reﬂects the deepness of relations for instance by the families, the working

team, the hobbies or the home district. The situation is depicted in Fig. 1 schematically

[18]. The highest level can be regarded as a population of N individuals or nodes. This

N nodes may then be partitioned into b groups, each of them can further divided into b

subgroups and so on. After (ℓ − 1) divisions the structure has a total of ℓ levels. The

underlying structure ends at a level where an individual belongs to a close functional group
of size g where 1 ≤ g ≤ N is typically of the order 101 to 102. The members belonging to

the lowest-level subgroup have the highest change of getting friends or in general becoming

similar. As stressed in [20] the division in subgroups is usually not unique. For example,

all physicists in a certain university can be classiﬁed roughly by their research area but

simultaneously they can be grouped geographically based on the region where their institute

4

is located. As usually the number of persons taking part in a party (nodes) may thus be

characterized by H hierarchies. Each of them takes on the structure shown in Fig. 1. As a

further important quantity within a hierarchy let us introduce the social distance xij that

measures the similarity between two nodes i and j. In case of diﬀerent hierarchies we deﬁne

xij = maxH xH

ij . For nodes belonging to the same lowest-level group in a given hierarchy,

xij = 1, otherwise the social distance is even the number of levels from the lowest for which

the nodes belong to the same group.

friends, is established with a probability

The probability that a person xi is linked to a person xj, specifying that i and j are

P (xij) =

exp(−αxij)
n=1 exp(−αn)

Pℓ

(1)

Here the parameter α is a measure of homophily of the system. With other words, the

quantity α characterizes the deepness of the contacts between two nodes (persons) within the

system. The probability, given in Eq. (1), guarantees that for α ≫ 1 only links between nodes

with small separation, e. g. such belonging to the same subgroup, are probable, whereas for

α = − ln b, links between individuals with any social distance are equally probable. In that

case a random network results. For intermediate values of α, the network shows small-world

features.

The above division process is repeated until a mean number of hzi = hgi − 1 links are

established for each individual in the system. Here hzi is the averaged number of friends

within the network. Concluding this section we emphasize the model is characterized by
the set of parameters N, H, b, ℓ, g and hzi with the number of nodes N = hgibℓ−1. The

quantity hgi is the average size of the lowest-level subgroups.

III. PARTY MODELLING AND RESULTS

A. The network

A stressed above the social network will be constructed according to [15]. For a population

of N individuals the structure is shown in Fig. 1. The links between diﬀerent nodes (agents,

persons) are made by the following steps. Firstly we chose a node xi from the set of all nodes

randomly. Then we take a link of the distance xij with the probability given by Eq. (1).
In a next step we select from all nodes with the given distance xij from xi a second node

5

xj. After this a link between the nodes xi and xj is established. Such a link speciﬁes that i

and j are friends, e. g. more mathematically, the node xj is added to the adjacency list Ai
and the node xi is added to Aj. This procedure is repeated until the persons in the network

exhibit a mean number hzi of friends. As the result we obtain a set of adjacency lists A

which characterizes the network totally.

In Fig. 2 we show the frequency distribution of

neighbors (or friends or contacts) for diﬀerent values of the homophily parameter α. Let us

point out that the distribution is determined by the network essentially. The results have

to be incorporated in the further consideration.

To initialize the parties into the model there exits diﬀerent possibilities. Once one could

chose a special distribution of the parties initially, or there is a preselection in such a manner

that some places for parties are favored in advance. This situation is not considered here,

because we are interested in the self-organization mechanism. While the parties are in

progress, the participants want to come to a decision. Instead of that we apply a random

distribution of parties.

In the next step we discuss the procedure for making the decision to leave or to stay

at a party. For illustration let us assume that a person i is on a certain party denoted as

party number 5. The friend of i, labeled by j, is on another party, for instance that one

with number 2. As a result of the phone call of i with j there appears two possibilities for

j. Either j remains on its party or j changes from its party 2 to party 5. As a criteria

for the decision person j disposes of information of its own party, denoted by a and of the

other party by communication, characterized by, lets say b. Now we deﬁne a function (a, b),

speciﬁed below, the result of which is the decision “go”, in case the party of i is better than

the party of its own party (j’s party) and is “stay” in the opposite case. In our realization

person xj knows the number of friends on its party. Thus let us chose a = #(Aj ∩Mj), where
Mj is total number of peoples at the party j. Likewise the person xj knows the number of

friends on i’s party. Consequently we chose b = #(Aj ∩ Mi), where Mi is the total number

of peoples at the party i. A very simple, but realistic rule, is to take the decision (a, b) →

“go”, whenever a < b. In the opposite case a ≥ b the decision is “stay”. In case the number

of friends of the other party is larger than on the own party the person decides to change.

6

B. Results

In this part the results of the simulation are presented. In particular, we want to demon-

strate the essential inﬂuence of the parameter α introduced in Eq. (1). In Fig. 3 the long-time

expansion for the size of parties is shown for α = − ln 2. One observes that one party is

the winner of the competition. All other parties deplete during the course of the evening.

As depicted in Fig. 4 this situation is not preprogrammed. In that ﬁgure the short-time

expansion of the party-size is shown for the same parameter α = − ln 2 as in Fig. 3. Not

that party will be best one at which initially the most persons have been present. Insofar

our model seems to be ergodic. However, this point needs further studies. A very typical

situation is oﬀered in Fig. 5. Here the homophily parameter is large α ≫ − ln b. As stressed

in the last section this guarantees that only links between nodes with small separation are

probable. The behavior of the system will be dominated by small or isolated subgroups.

The same situation is also observed for other intermediate values of α. Now let us consider

the case that only party “survives” with higher accuracy. Such a situation is already shown

in Fig. 3. In Fig. 6 we show the results for the region − ln 2 ≤ α ≤ 1. For α = αc ≡ −0.198

the system undergoes a phase transition from a single party state for α = −0.2 > αc to a

multi-party state for α = −0.197 < αc. The sharp increase is not due an external impact

but exclusively by the internal, self-organized interaction between the members of the social

group. As demonstrated by a slight modiﬁcation of the parameter α near to αc the result is

stable. A similar phenomenon but in another context was observed in [23].

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In the present paper we have established a simple model to study the behavior of (young)

peoples taking part at diﬀerent parties within a large city. Due to the mobile phones they

are able to exchange information permanently. This fact enables the group an everlasting

evaluation of the respective party at which they are present. As a simple but realistic

measure of the deepness of contacts we have introduce a list of friends labeled to each

person. Governed by the aim, to be at the “best” party, the number of friends at a certain

party is casting for a decision to leave or to stay at the party. In according to a majority

rule any person decides spontaneously to leave its party. An important role for the social

7

contacts between the involved persons is played by the homophily parameter α introduced in

Eq. (1). Depending on the value of α we observe diﬀerent scenarios. There is a critical value

αc at which the system oﬀers a phase transition from a multi-party behavior to a single-

party state.

It would be interesting to study an analytical approach based on a q-state

Potts-model as suggested in [21] for fuzzy community structures or [22] in case of ﬁnancial

market simulations.

Draft for CiSE

Simulation of language competition by physicists

Christian Schulze and Dietrich Stauﬀer

1 Introduction

Physicists have applied their methods to ﬁelds outside physics since a long
time: biology, economics, social phenomena, . . .. Similar methods sometimes
were also applied by experts from the ﬁelds, like Stuart Kauﬀman for ge-
netics and Nobel laureates Harry Markowitz and Thomas Schelling for stock
markets and racial segregation, respectively. Thus physicists may re-invent
the wheel, with modiﬁcations. However, everybody who followed Formula
1 car races knows how important slight modiﬁcations of the Bridgestone or
Michelin tires are. Biological [1], economic [2] and social [3, 4] applications
by physicists were already discussed in earlier issue of this CiSE department.
A common property of many of the simulations by physicists is that they
deal with individuals (atoms, humans, . . .) since half a century, who may be
called “agents” outside physics.

Thus this review summarises a more recent fashion in physics triggered
by Abrams and Strogatz [5]: Computer simulation of language competition.
The world knows thousands of living languages, from Chinese spoken by 109
people to many dying languages with just one surviving speaker. Can we
explain this language size distribution ns, Fig.1, by simple models? Will we
soon all speak the same language and its dialects?

First we summarise several models of others, then we present in greater

detail variants of our model [8] without asserting that it is always better.

2 Various models

The web site http://www.isrl.uiuc.edu/amag/langev/ contains about thou-
sand papers on computational linguistics, but mostly on the learning of lan-
guages by children or the evolution of human languages out of simpler sounds
a million years ago [9]. The more recent development seems triggered by [5]
who used diﬀerential equations to describe the vanishing of one language due
to the dominance of one other language. Figure 2 shows that in their basic

size

Figure 1: Current size distribution ns of human languages. This size s is the
number of people having one particular language as mother tongue, and we
plot the number ns of such languages versus their s. Most sizes were binned
to give better statistics. The parabola indicates a log-normal distribution
which ﬁts well except for very small sizes [6, 7].

model the minority language dies out if it does not have a higher social status
than the majority language. (The populations are in principle inﬁnite and
thus the fractions in the populations are plotted in this Fig.2.) Bilingual
people were included into this model later [10], and these diﬀerential equa-
tions on every site of a large lattice allowed to study the coexistence of the
two languages along a rather sharp border [11].

Bit-string models are computationally advantageous, and Kosmidis et al
[12] use, for example, 20 bits to describe 20 language features which can be
learned or forgotten by an individual. The ﬁrst 10 bits deﬁne one language,
the remaining 10 bits another language. In this way, bilinguals (having nearly
20 bits set) and mixture languages like English (having ten randomly selected
bits set) can be studied as well as monolingual people (having most of the

ﬁrst 10 or most of the last 10 bits set.)

Biological ageing was included in [13]; this allowed to take into account
that foreign languages should be learned when we are young. This work
therefore is a bridge between the language competition reviewed here and
the older language learning literature of, for example, [14].

All these simulations studied two or a rather limited number of languages.
A string of n bits instead allows for 2n languages if each diﬀerent bit-string
is interpreted as a diﬀerent language. A two-byte computer word then cor-
responds to 16 diﬀerent important aspects of, say, the grammar of 65536
possible languages [8].

Also [15] simulated numerous languages in a model which allows switching
from rare to widespread languages, and could reproduce the empirical fact
that the number of diﬀerent languages, spoken in an area A, varies roughly
as A0.4. A linguist and a mathematician [16] had languages deﬁned by strings
of integer numbers (similar to but earlier than our above version) which then

3

allow for branching as in biological speciation trees, due to mutations and
transfer of numbers.

The above-mentioned model for learning a language [14] may also be
interpreted as a model for competition languages of adults. It uses sets of
deterministic diﬀerential equations and inﬁnite populations, like the two-
language model of Abrams and Strogatz [5], but for an arbitrary number of
languages. Starting everybody speaking the same language, one may end
up with a fragmentation into numerous small languages, due to the natural
changes from one generation to the next. And starting instead with many
languages of equal size, this situation may become unstable due to these
permanent changes and may lead to the dominance of one language spoken
by nearly everybody. In the style of statistical physics, the many coeﬃcients
of the diﬀerential equations describing the rise and the fall of the many
languages can be chosen as random instead of making all of them the same [7].
Then Fig.3 shows for the small languages coexisting besides the dominant one
a reasonable size distribution ns. Up to 8000 languages (the current number
of human languages) were simulated, with two 8000 × 8000 matrices for the
coeﬃcients. Fig.4 shows not the absolute language sizes but the fractions of
people speaking a language.

In between the learning of a language and the competition of languages
is the application of the Naming Game [17]: Two randomly selected people
meet and try to communicate. The speaker selects an object and retrieves
a word for it from the own inventory (or invents a new word). The hearer
checks if in the own inventory this object is named by the same word. If yes,
both players remove from their inventory all other word-object associations
for this object; otherwise the hearer merely adds this association to the own
inventory. A sharp transition towards understanding was simulated.

If the aim is the reproduce a language size distribution as in Fig.1, then of
all the models reviewed here the one of [15] seems best, since it gave language
sizes between one and several millions, and thus is explained now in greater
detail. The model describes the colonisation of a continent = square lattice
by people who originally speak one language ”zero”. Each lattice site k has a
capability Ck between zero and one, measuring its resources and proportional
to the population on that site. Starting from one initial site where language
i = 0 is spoken, in an otherwise empty lattice, at each time step one randomly
selected empty neighbour of an occupied site is occupied, with probability
∝ Ck. It gets the language of one of its previously occupied neighbours, with
a probability increasing with increasing ﬁtness of that neighbour language.

Figure 3: Language size distribution ns (part a) and fraction of people speak-
ing the most widespread language (part b), for the model of de Oliveira et
al [15].

This ﬁtness is for each language the sum of all Ck for sites speaking this
language, i.e. proportional to the size of that language.

In order to describe the slow divergence of languages in diﬀerent regions,
such that not everybody in the whole lattice speaks the same language, the
languages are mutated with probability α/ﬁtness, where the mutation co-
eﬃcient α is a free parameter. A mutated language gets an integer index
i = 1, 2, 3, . . . not used before for any language. This whole process of prop-
agation and mutation stops when all lattice sites are occupied and the lan-
guages are counted. With on average 64 people per site, and thus 1010 people
per sample, we see in Fig.3a that in many cases the largest language is spoken

5

by 109 people, as in reality for Chinese. Fig.3b shows more systematically
the fraction of people speaking the most widespread language, as a function
of lattice size and mutation coeﬃcient. We see a smooth transition from
domination of one language at small α to fragmentation in many languages
at large α, with the crossover point strongly depending on lattice size. (We
summed for Fig.3a over ten lattices of size 16384 × 16384 at a mutation co-
eﬃcient α = 0.002 yielding 20500 languages in each sample. For Fig.3b we
averaged over 100 L × L lattices with L = 64, 256, 1024 and 4096 from right
to left; L = 8192 gave non-monotonic behaviour, not shown.)

This section presents a deﬁnition of our model [8] and then selected simula-
tions.

3 Our model

3.1 Deﬁnition

A language is assumed to be deﬁned by F variables or features, each of which
is an integer between 1 and Q. Thus we can simulate the competition between
up to QF diﬀerent languages. In the simplest (bit-string) case we have only
binary variables, Q = 2. We assume that on every site of a L × L square
lattice sits exactly one person, who interacts with the four nearest lattice
neighbours. If the person dies, his/her child takes the place and speaks the
same language, apart from minor changes which we call “mutations” as in
biology.

The model is based on three probabilities: the mutation probability p,
the transfer probability q, and the ﬂight probability r. At each of t itera-
tions, each of the F variables is mutated with probability p to a new value
between 1 and Q. This new value is taken randomly with probability 1 − q,
while with probability q it is taken as that of a randomly selected lattice
neighbour. Finally each person at every iteration, for each of the F features
separately, switches with probability (1 − x2)r to the language of another
person selected randomly from the whole population; here the original lan-
guage is spoken by a fraction x of all people. In this way our model combines
local and global interactions. Thus languages change continuously through p
and borrow features from other languages through q, while a small language
faces extinction through r because its speakers switch to more widespread

6

languages.

This version of our model is both simpler and more complicated than our
previous versions [8]. It is more complicated since each feature is an integer
between 1 and Q, and not just a bit equal to zero or one. For the special case
Q = 2 this does not matter, and then the present version is simpler since it
has a constant population, thus ignoring the possible human history starting
with one language for Adam and Eve. But the main result will turn out to
be the same: Starting from one language spoken by everybody, we may see a
fragmentation into numerous languages, similar to the other biblical story of
the Babylonian tower. Whether that happens depends on our probabilities
for mutation, transfer and ﬂight (p, q, r).

tom to top.

3.2 Results

Starting with all variables the same, near Q/2, we ﬁrst count how many
variables have which value. For small p and large q we found that even after
hundreds of iterations nearly all variables still have their initial values, i.e.
the initial language dominates in the population. For large p and small q
instead also other values were found in large numbers, and the population is
fragmented into many languages. Figure 4 shows the phase diagram in the
p-q-plane, with dominance everywhere except in the upper left corner; for
Q = 2, 3and5 the results roughly agree at F = 8, and also at F = 4 we get
the same curve for Q = 3 and 10: F is more important than Q. In Fig.5 the
switching probability proportional to r is deﬁned instead by the size of one
feature only, and only this feature and not the whole language is switched;
now Q is more important.

To get a reasonable size distribution ns of the shape shown in Fig.1, we

Figure 6: Distribution ns of language sizes, summed from 1000 lattices with
L = 201, at F = 8, Q = 3, t = 300, p = q = 1/2.

summed over several lattices and found Fig.6: As in Fig.1 we see a somewhat
asymmetric parabola on this log-log plot, indicating a log-normal distribution
with enhanced small languages. While the shape is good, the absolute sizes
are far too small. In Fig.3a the absolute sizes were nice but the shape was
not rounded enough. Well, you cannot have everything in life.

Our model was continued and improved in [18] who determined the Ham-
ming distance between the languages, which is the number of bits which diﬀer
in a position-by-position comparison of two bit-strings. They then make the
switching from one language to another depending on the Hamming distance;
thus they took into account that for a Portuguese it is easier to learn Spanish
than Chinese.

4 Summary

We see that lost of recent models have been invented, quite independently,
at diﬀerent places in the world. Basically, they can be divided into those de-
scribing two or only few languages, and those who deﬁne diﬀerent languages
by diﬀerent bit-strings or generalisations and thus allow for numerous pos-
sible languages.
In the latter case, not necessarily the ﬁnal status will be
dominance of one languge. Not all these approaches could give results like
the empirical facts in Fig.1; there is lots of work to be done.

5 Appendix

This Fortran 77 program simulates the model of Viviane de Oliveira et
al [15] in a memory-saving form. The capacities Ck (= populations of
site k) are randomly ﬁxed integers between 1 and 127, and the limitk,
randomly ﬁxed between 1 and 2047, are the upper limits for the ﬁtness
fk = Pk ck/128. The number diﬀerent languages are distinguished by an
index lang = 1, 2, ...number and are spoken by icount(lang)) people. The
language size distribution ns (non-cumulative) is calculated by binning the
sizes in powers of two. The random integers ibm vary between −263 and
+263. We follow the Gerling criterion that published programs should not
contain more lines than authors have years in their life. Questions should be
sent to stauﬀer@thp.uni-koeln.de.

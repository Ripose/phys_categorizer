Publicly available data reveal long-term systematic features about citation statistics and how

papers are referenced. The data also tell fascinating citation histories of individual articles.

Introduction

The ﬁrst particle published in the Physical Review was
received in 1893; the journal’s ﬁrst volume included 6 is-
sues and 24 articles. In the 20th century, the Physical
Review branched into topical sections and spawned new
journals. Today, all articles in the Physical Review fam-
ily of journals (PR) are available online and, as a useful
byproduct, all citations in PR articles are electronically
available.

The citation data provide a treasure trove of quanti-
tative information. As individuals who write scientiﬁc
papers, most of us are keenly interested in how often
our own work is cited. As dispassionate observers, we
can use the citation data to identify inﬂuential research,
new trends in research, unanticipated connections across
ﬁelds, and in subﬁelds that are exhausted. A certain
pleasure can also can be gleaned from the data when they
reveal the idiosyncratic features in the citation histories
of individual publications.

The investigation of citation statistics has a long
history1 in which a particularly noteworthy contribution
was a 1965 study by Derek John de Solla Price2. In his
study, Price built upon original models by George Yule
and Herbert Simon3 to argue that the distribution in
the number of citations to individual publications had a
power-law form. Price also noted that well-cited papers
continue to be referenced more frequently than less-cited
papers, and coined the term cumulative advantage to de-
scribe the mechanism that causes a persistently higher
rate4. Cumulative advantage means that the probability
that a publication is cited is an increasing function of its
current number of citations.

In the framework of current fashionable evolving
network models, the mechanism is called preferential
attachment5. Linear preferential attachment models pro-
vide appealing explanations for the power-law distribu-
tions of connections that are observed in many social sys-
tems, natural networks, and manmade networks such as
the World Wide Web6. One fundamental motivation for
studying citation statistics is to determine whether they
exhibit some of the universal features that have been as-
cribed to prototypical models of evolving networks5,7,8.
Before examining the citation data, I oﬀer several
caveats: First, the data include only internal citations
— that is, citations from PR articles to other PR articles
— and are perforce incomplete. For highly cited papers,
a previous study9 found that total citations typically out-
number internal ones by a factor of 3 to 5, a result that

gives a sense of the incompleteness of the PR data. Sec-
ond, some 5–10% of citations appear to be erroneous9,10,
although the recent practice by PR of crosschecking ref-
erences when manuscripts are submitted has signiﬁcantly
reduced the error rate. Third, papers can be highly cited
for many reasons — some substantive and some dubious.
Thus the number of citations is merely an approximate
proxy for scientiﬁc quality.

Citation distribution and attachment rate

The PR citation cover 353,268 papers and 3,110,839
citations from July 1893 through June 2003. The 329,847
publications with at least 1 citation may be broken down
as follows:

11 publications with > 1000 citations
79 publications with > 500 citations
237 publications with > 300 citations
2,340 publications with > 100 citations
8,073 publications with > 50 citations
245,459 publications with < 10 citations
178,019 publications with <
5 citations
1 citation
84,144 publications with

A somewhat depressing observation is that nearly 70% of
all PR articles have been cited less than 10 times. (The
average number of citations is 8.8.) Also evident is the
small number of highly cited publications; table I lists
the 11 publications with more than 1000 citations.

Citations have grown rapidly with time, a feature that
mirrors the growth of PR family of journals. From 1893
until World War II, the number of annual citations, from
PR publications doubled approximately every 5.5 years.
The number of PR articles published in a given year also
doubled every 5.5 years. Following the publication crash
of the war years, the number of articles published annu-
ally doubled approximately every 15 years.

The citation data naturally raise the question, What is
the distribution of citations? That is, what is the prob-
ability P (k) that a paper gets cited k times? This ques-
tion was investigated by Price, who posited the power law
P (k) ∝ k−ν, with ν positive. A power-law form is excit-
ing for statistical physicists because it implies the absence
of a characteristic scale for citations — the inﬂuence of a
publication may range from useless to earth-shattering.
The absence of such a characteristic scale in turn implies
that citations statistics should exhibit many of the in-
triguing features associated with phase transitions, which
display critical phenomena on all length scales.

2

Somewhat surprisingly, the probability distribution de-
rived from more than 3 million PR citations still has sig-
niﬁcant statistical ﬂuctuations. It proves useful to study
k P (k′) dk′, the
the cumulative distribution, C(k) = R
probability that a paper is cited at least k times, to re-
duce these ﬂuctuations.

∞

On a double logarithmic scale, C(k) has a modest neg-
ative curvature everywhere. That behavior, illustrated in
Fig. 1, suggests that the distribution decays faster than
a power law and is at variance with previous, smaller-
scale studies that suggested either a power-law2,11 or a
stretched exponential form12, P (k) ∝ exp(−kβ), with
β < 1. It is intriguing that a good ﬁt over much of the
range of the range of the distribution is the log-normal
form C(k) = A e−b ln k−c(ln k)
. Log-normal forms typi-
cally underlie random multiplicative processes. The de-
scribe, for example, the distribution of fragment sizes
that remain after a rock has been hammered many times.

, with A = 0.15, b = 0.40, and
c = 0.16.

The development of citations may be characterized by
the attachment rate Ak, which gives the likelihood that a
paper with k citations will be cited by a new article. To
measure the attachment rate, ﬁrst count the number of
times each paper is cited during a speciﬁed time range;
this gives k. Then, to get Ak, count the number of times
each paper with a given k in this time window was cited
in a subsequent window. As shown in Fig. 2, the data
suggest that Ak is a linear function of k, especially for k <
150, a condition that applies to nearly all PR papers13.
Thus linear preferential attachment appears to account
for the propagation of citations.

Linear attachment, though, leads to two paradoxes.
First, a linear rate implies a power-law citation distri-
bution, but Fig. 1 indicates that the data are better de-

FIG. 2: The attachment rate Ak is a nearly linear function
of the number of citations k, especially for k less than 150
(inset). The diﬀerent colors indicate diﬀerent year ranges for
establishing k: 1990-1999 (blue squares), 1980-1999 (green
▽), 1970-1999 (red △), and 1893-1999 (black ◦). The rate

scribed by a log-normal form. While a log-normal distri-
bution does arise from the nearly linear attachment rate
Ak = k/(1 + a ln k), with a positive, Fig. 2 hints that
Ak may be growing slightly faster than linearly with k.
Second, to implement linear preferential attachment con-
sciously, a citer must be aware of the references to every
existing paper. That’s clearly not realistic. A more real-
istic process that can lead to linear preferential attach-
ment is the redirection mechanism7,14. In redirection, an
author who is writing the reference list for a paper ﬁg-
uratively picks a random paper. Then the author cites
either the random selected paper (with probability 1 − r)
or one of the references within that paper (with probabil-
ity r). This purely local mechanism generates the linear
form Ak = k +( 1
r −2)7. Still a mystery is why the myriad
of attributes that inﬂuences whether a paper gets cited
manifests itself as a citation rate that is a nearly linear
function of the number of citations.

Age structure

A common adage says that nobody cites classic papers
Is this really true? How long does a paper

anymore.
continue to get cited?

The age of a citation is the diﬀerence between the year
when a citation occurs and the publication year of the
cited paper. Typically, unpopular papers are cited soon
after publication, if at all, and then disappear. The con-
verse is also true. For example, the average citation age
hai over the entire PR data set is 6.2 years, but articles

published before 2000 for which hai is less than 2 years re-
ceive, on average, only 3.6 citations. On the other hand,
highly cited papers usually continue to be cited for a long
time, and vice versa. Papers with more than 100 cita-
tions have hai = 11.7 years, and the 11 publications with
more than 1000 citations have hai = 18.9 years. For all
PR publications with500 or fewer citations, the average
citation age grows with the number of citations roughly
as hai = kα, with α ≈ 0.3.

The citation age distributions — that is, the number
of citations a a function of age — reveal a fact that is
surprising at ﬁrst sight: The exponential growth of PR
articles strongly skews the form of the age distributions!
There are, in fact two distinct age distributions. One is
the distribution of citing ages, deﬁned as the number of
citations of a given age from a paper. Remarkably, citing
memory is independent of when a paper is published. An
author publishing now seems to have the same range of
memory as an author who published an article 50 years
ago. The citing age distribution roughly decays expo-
nentially in age, except for a sharp decrease in citations
during the period of World War II. However, citing an old
paper is diﬃcult a priori simply because relatively few old
publications exist. As noted by Hideshiro Nakamoto15,
a more meaningful citing age distribution is obtained by
rescaling the distribution by the total number of pub-
lications in each citing year. So, if one is interested in
journal citations from 2005, the number of cited papers
that are, say, four years old should be scaled by the total
number of papers published in 2001. The rescaling has
a dramatic eﬀect: The nearly exponential citing age dis-
tribution is transformed into a power-law! An analogous
skewing due to the rapid growth of PR articles also oc-
curs in the distribution of cited ages, that is, the number
of citation of a given age to an article.

Individual citation histories

The citation histories of well-cited publications are di-
verse from the collective citation history of all PR arti-
cles. The varied histories roughly fall into classes that in-
clude revived classic works or “sleeping beauties”16, ma-
jor discoveries, and hot publications. It’s fun to examine
examples of each class.

Sometimes a publication will become in vogue after a
long dormancy — a revival of an old classic. I arbitrar-
ily deﬁne a revived classic as a nonreview PR articles,
published before 1961, that has received more than 250
citations and has a ratio of the average citation age to
the age of the paper greater than 0.7. Thus, revived
classics are well-cited old papers with the bulk of their
citations occurring long after publication. Only the 12
papers listed in table II ﬁt these criteria.

The clustered citation histories of the ﬁve articles plot-
ted in in Fig. 3 are particularly striking. These articles,
published between 1951 and 1960 (with three in the same
issue of Physical Review),
investigated the double ex-

change mechanism in Perovskite manganites, the mech-
anism responsible for the phenomenon of colossal mag-
netoresistance. This topic became in vogue in the 1990’s
because of the conﬂuence of new synthesis and measure-
ment techniques in thin-ﬁlm transition-metal oxides, the
sheer magnitude of the eﬀect, and the clever use of the
term “colossal”. The citation burst more than 40 years
after the publication of these ﬁve articles is unique in the
history of the PR journals.

The other seven papers have diﬀerent claims to fame.
Eugene Wigner’s 1932 paper had 115 citations before
1980 and 447 through June 2003. Similarly, the Albert
Einstein, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen (EPR) paper
had 36 citations before 1980 and 456 more through June
2003. With average citation ages of 55.8 and 59.6 re-
spectively, these are the longest-lived articles with more
than 35 citations in the PR family. Those papers, as
well as the one by Yakir Aharonov and David Bohm,
owe their renewed popularity to the upsurge of interest
in quantum information phenomena. Wigner’s 1934 pa-
pers deals with correlations in an electron gas, a problem
of enduring interest in condensed matter physics. Ju-
lian Schwinger’s work is a classic contribution to quan-
tum electrodynamics. The 1958 publication by Philip
Anderson helped launched the ﬁeld of localization. And
Richard Feynman’s paper presented a widely applicable
method for calculating molecular forces. Feynman’s ar-
ticle is noteworthy because it is cited by all PR journals
(except the accelerators and beams special topics jour-
nal).

Publications that announce discoveries often receive a
citation spike when the contribution becomes recognized.
I arbitrarily deﬁne a discovery paper has having more
than 500 citations and a ratio of average citation age to
publication age less than 0.4; I exclude articles published
in Reviews of Modern Physics and compilations by the

Particle Data Group. Table III lists the 11 such discov-
ery papers; all were published between 1962 and 1991. A
trend in this group of papers is the shift from elementary-
particle physics (the six articles published before 1976)
to condensed-matter physics (the ﬁve articles published
after 1983). The earlier discovery papers reﬂected ma-
jor developments in elementary-particle physics, includ-
ing SU (3) symmetry, the prediction of charm, and grand
uniﬁed theories. The condensed matter articles are on
quasicrystals, multifractrals, and high-temperature su-
perconductivity.
If the citation threshold is relaxed to
300, an additional seven papers ﬁt the discovery criteria.
All of these are concerned with high-temperature super-
conductivity, and all but one appear during the golden
age of the ﬁeld, 1987–89.

It is not clear whether the shift in the ﬁeld of discovery
publications stems from a sea change in research direction
or because of from prosaic concerns. The past 15 years
have seen a major upsurge in quantum condensed-matter
physics that perhaps stems from the discovery of high-
temperature superconductivity. But recent elementary-
particle physics discoveries may be underrepresented in
PR because many CERN-based discoveries have been
published in journals outside the PR family.

FIG. 4: Six classic, highly-cited publications have varied
citation histories. The abbreviations are deﬁned in the text.

A number of classic, highly cited publications have
noteworthy citations histories. Fig. 4 illustrates some
of these histories. Citations to “Theory of Superconduc-
tivity”, Phys. Rev. 108, 1175 (1957) by John Bardeen,
Leon Cooper and J. Robert Schrieﬀer (BCS) closely track
the activity in superconductivity; the paper received its
fewest citations in 1985, the year before the discovery
of high-temperature superconductivity. The BCS paper
is the earliest with more than 1000 citations in the PR
family. Steven Weinberg’s paper (W) “A Model of Lep-
tons”, on the electroweak theory, (Phys. Rev. Lett. 19,
1264 (1967)), has a broad citation peak followed by a
relatively slow decay as beﬁts this seminal paper’s long-

4

term inﬂuence. On the other hand, the average citation
age for the 1974 publications that announced the discov-
ery of the J/ψ particle – Phys. Rev. Lett. 33, 1404 and
1406 (1974) – is less than 3 years!

An unusual example is “Scaling Theory of Localiza-
tion: Absence of Quantum Diﬀusion in Two Dimen-
sions”, Phys. Rev. Lett. 42, 673 (1979) by Elihu Abra-
hams, Anderson, Don Licciardello and T. V. Ramakrish-
nan (the so-called gang of four; G4). Since publication,
the G4 paper has been cited 30–60 times annually, a strik-
ing testament to its long-term impact. The paper with
the most citations in all PR journals is “Self-Consistent
Equations Including Exchange and Correlation Eﬀects”,
Phys. Rev. 140, A1133 (1965) by Walter Kohn and Lu
Sham (KS). Amazingly, citations to this publication have
been steadily increasing for nearly 40 years.

The KS paper is also an example of what may be called
a hot paper, deﬁned as a nonreview paper with 350 or
more citations, a ratio of average citation age to publi-
cation age greater than two-thirds, and a citation rate
increasing with time. Ten papers, listed in table IV, ﬁt
these criteria. The 1932 Wigner and 1935 EPR articles,
both more than 70 years old, and the two most-cited PR
papers of all time, KS and the 1964 article by Pierre
Hohenberg Kohn, are all still hot. Astounding!

Of the remaining six hot papers, ﬁve are in quantum
condensed-matter physics. Three of them build on the
formalism introduced in the seminal articles by Hohen-
berg and Kohn and by Kohn and Sham. Another, An-
derson’s 1958 localization paper, can be viewed both as
hot and as the revival of a classic. The newest hot arti-
cle, by Charles Bennett and coauthors, is concerned with
quantum information theory, a research area that has
recently become fashionable and also led to the sharp in-
crease in citations to Wigner’s 1932 paper and the 1935
EPR paper.

A unique window

A small number of physicists have played a remarkably
large role in top-cited PR publications. Two individuals
have coauthored ﬁve papers from among the top 100 cited
PR articles9: Kohn, who occupies positions 1, 2, 24, 96,
and 100, and Anderson, with positions 9, 19, 20, 35, and
41. Wigner appears four times (4, 8, 53, and 55), and
Lars Onsager (16, 64, and 68) and John Slater (12, 27,
and 40) each appear three times.

The PR citation data provide a unique window with
which to study the development of citations, and the
work I have described can be extended and applied in
many ways. For example, constructing a graphical rep-
resentation of the entire dynamically changing citation
network should be revealing. Such a graph could show
how ﬁelds develop and could expose unexpected connec-
tions between disparate areas. A practical, if more con-
troversial, use of citation data would be to construct ret-
rospective journals that include only highly cited papers.

Such journals would provide a welcome reduction in the
total literature volume, because only 30% of all articles
have more than 10 citations and a mere 2.3% have more
than 50 citations. A repository for all publications would
still be necessary, as sleeping beauties do emerge long af-
ter publication.

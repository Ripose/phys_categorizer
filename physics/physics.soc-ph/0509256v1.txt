Abstract

A non-trivial probability structure is evident in the binary data extracted from the up/down price

movements of very high frequency data such as tick-by-tick data for USD/JPY. In this paper, we

analyze the Sony bank USD/JPY rates, ignoring the small deviations from the market price. We

then show there is a similar non-trivial probability structure in the Sony bank rate, in spite of the

Sony bank rate’s having less frequent and larger deviations than tick-by-tick data. However, this

probability structure is not found in the data which has been sampled from tick-by-tick data at

the same rate as the Sony bank rate. Therefore, the method of generating the Sony bank rate

from the market rate has the potential for practical use since the method retains the probability

structure as the sampling frequency decreases.

INTRODUCTION

In recent years, there have been various analyses of high frequency ﬁnancial data which

has been within the past decade become available [1, 2]. High frequency ﬁnancial data

describe the market behavior in ﬁne detail and they have an interesting statistical property

that is not seen from the low frequency data.

In our previous works [3, 6], we showed the non-trivial probability structure in the tick-

by-tick data for USD/JPY with a focus on the direction of up/down price movements, as

opposed to the extent of price movement. A non-trivial probability structure is not apparent

from price changes themselves [4]. Such a probability structure is also observed in the high

frequency data of the NYSE for example GE data. In addition, we proposed the non-linear

logit model that agrees well with the empirical data.

The purpose of this paper is to understand in more detail the non-trivial probability

structure of binarized high frequency data. We analyze the Sony bank USD/JPY rates,

ignoring the small deviations from the market rate. We found that the non-trivial probability

structure is evident in the Sony bank USD/JPY rate, even if the data have about a 20 minute

interval between data points and larger price changes than tick-by-tick data.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we ﬁrst explain the Sony bank and the

Sony bank rate. In Section 3, we analyze the Sony bank rate. We present our conclusions

in Section 4.

II. DATA

A. Sony bank

The Sony bank (http://moneykit.net/), launched in 2001, is an internet-based bank

for individual customers in Japan and aims to provide them with low cost services as close

as possible to the professional market environment. One of their main services is online

foreign-exchange trading, and this is quite popular. As of July 2005, the Sony bank deals

with eight currencies and they have about 130,000 foreign-currency accounts, which is about

30% of the total number of accounts. On the other hand, foreign-currency accounts are only

about 3% of all accounts in conventional banks.

There are three main reasons for the popularity of the bank’s foreign-exchange trading.

Firstly, trades can be made on the web 24 hours a day, 7 day a week. In conventional banks

in Japan, however, customers actually have to go to a branch and can trade only during

weekday business hours. Secondly, customers can trade at the Sony bank’s rate which at all

times closely reﬂects the market rate. In conventional banks, the trading rate for individual

customers is ﬁxed at one time in the morning for the day’s trading. Finally, the bank’s low

transaction cost. For example, the trading cost of the Sony bank for USD/JPY is 0.25 yen

per dollar, which is about a quarter of the trading cost of conventional banks

FIG. 1: Update of the Sony bank rate for USD/JPY. The Sony bank USD/JPY rate is a solid line

and the market rate is a broken line. In this ﬁgure, the Sony bank USD/JPY rate is ﬁxed from t0

to t1 and is updated to the market rate at t2, as the market rate exceeds the range of 0.1 yen at

t2 based on the market rate at t0.

In this paper, we analyze the Sony bank rate for USD/JPY. The Sony bank rate is the

foreign-currency exchange rate that customers having a foreign-currency account of the Sony

bank can deal at. The Sony bank rate is dependent on the market rate but is independent

of the customers’ orders. If the USD/JPY market rate changes more than 0.1 yen, the Sony

bank rate is updated to the market rate. Figure 1 is a schematic of the updating of the

Sony bank rate for USD/JPY. If the market rate changes along the broken line, the Sony

bank rate follows the solid line. Suppose the market rate (broken line) is the same as the

Sony bank rate (solid line) at the time t0. The Sony bank rate stays ﬂat from t0 to t1, as

3

the market rate is in the range of 0.1 yen based on the market rate at t0. When the market

rate exceeds the range of 0.1 yen at t2, the Sony bank rate is updated to the market rate.

Since the Sony bank rate ignores small deviations in the market price by applying its

updating rule, the Sony bank rate has less frequent and larger price changes than tick-by-

tick data. The comparison is shown in Table I. The smallest price change, which is the

majority of the price changes, is 0.1 yen for the Sony bank rate. On the other hand, 40% of

price changes in tick-by-tick data are zero deviations between data points. We ignore such

cases in order to focus on only the direction of up/down price movements. Then tick-by-tick

data moves by a 0.01 yen unit.

III. ANALYSIS

We analyze the Sony bank USD/JPY rates for the period of 22/10/2001 to 31/05/2005

(Figure 2). The data is composed of value S(t) of yen value per dollar at the Sony bank tick

step t. The number of data is 45,577.

As analyzed in our previous works [3, 6], we ﬁrst binarize data extracting the direction

of the up/down price movement in the following way: X(t) = +1 if S(t + 1) − S(t) > 0 and

X(t) = −1 if S(t + 1) − S(t) < 0. According to the update rule, the Sony bank rate do not

have zero deviations between data points (S(t + 1) − S(t) = 0) not like tick-by-tick data.

Next we compute the conditional probabilities of binary data X(t) upto 4th order.

Then we show the non-trivial conditional probability structure of the binary data X(t).

Figure 3 is the probability structure of the Sony bank rates for whole period, and the ﬁrst

half of the data and the second half of the data. The data was divided into two periods

to compare the tendencies. We show only “+” side of the conditional probabilities because

of the up/down symmetry. Although it would seem obvious that if the market is rising,

there must be more +’s than -’s, in fact, if we only have the data which is triggers and

change in the Sony bank rate, there will be over the long run a almost equal number

of + and - changes. This non-trivial probability structure is not only in the ﬁrst order

conditional probabilities but also higher orders. Especially, it is likely to happen a regular

“zigzag” motion of alternating up and down, for example P (+|−, +, −, +) is 73%, rather

than irregular “zigzag” motions, for example P (+|−, +, −, +) is 63% and a motion in one

direction, for example P (+|+, +, +, +) is 40%.

It is interesting that the Sony bank rate has a probability structure, considering that

the average interval between data points is about 20 minutes. However, this probability

structure is not found in the data which has been sampled from tick-by-tick data at the

same rate as the Sony bank rate. Zhang looked similar higher order statistics and found

that the probability structure was not observed in the data recoded every 30 minutes [5].

In addition, the probability structure of the Sony bank rate is not the eﬀect of the negative

ﬁrst-order auto correlation in the second scale tick-by-tick data, since many transactions

occur during 20 minutes. Therefore, the method of generating the Sony bank rate from the

market rate can retain the probability structure as a sampling frequency decreases.

The probability structure of the Sony bank rate is not only based on less frequent sampling

but also larger deviations than tick-by-tick data. As shown in an Table I, the probability

structure of tick-by-tick data is mostly 0.01 yen price changes within 7 seconds on an average

FIG. 3: Probability structure of the Sony bank USD/JPY rate. Each conditional probability has

three bars. The upper one is the result of whole period 22/10/2001 to 31/05/2005. The middle is

for the ﬁrst half of the data. The lower is for the second half of the data. The error bars represent

a 95% conﬁdence interval on the mean

and sometimes even shorter. This may be too frequent and small for practical use. However,

the Sony bank rate essentially reﬂects mostly 0.1 yen price changes and about 20 minutes

interval between price chages. Therefore, there is a better chance to take advantage of the

Sony bank rate.

In addition, we compare the probability structure of GE stock data on NYSE shown

in [6]. The data was collected in December 2002. The number of GE data for one

day is about 180,000, which is more frequent than the tick-by-tick data for USD/JPY.

Figure 4 shows that the reliability of the probability structure increases as the sam-

pling frequency increases, comparing tick-by-tick data for USD/JPY, the Sony bank

USD/JPY rate and GE data on NYSE. The exceptions are regular “zigzag” motions such as

P (+|−, +), P (+|+, −, +), P (+|−, +, −, +). In these cases, the probability structure of the

Sony bank rate is more reliable than the tick-by-tick USD/JPY rate.

mean.

IV. CONCLUSION

We analyzed the Sony bank USD/JPY rate, which closely reﬂects the market rate, with

a focus on the up/down price movement, as opposed to the extent of price movement. The

Sony bank has a lower sampling rate and shows larger price change deviations than the

market rate. The main result is that a probability structure is observed in the Sony bank

rate, in spite of the interval between data points of the Sony bank rate is about 20 minutes.

However, this probability structure is not found in the data which has been sampled from

tick-by-tick data at the same rate as the Sony bank rate. Therefore, the method of generating

the Sony bank rate from the market rate can retain the probability structure as the sampling

frequency decreases. There is a better chance to take advantage of the Sony bank rate in

practical use.

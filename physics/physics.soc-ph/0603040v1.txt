Abstract. This econophysics work studies the long-range Ising model of a ﬁnite
system with N spins and the exchange interaction J
N and the external ﬁeld H as a
model for homogeneous credit portfolio of assets with default probability Pd and default
correlation ρd. Based on the discussion on the (J, H) phase diagram, we develop
a perturbative calculation method for the model and obtain explicit expressions for
Pd, ρd and the normalization factor Z in terms of the model parameters N and J, H.
The eﬀect of the default correlation ρd on the probabilities P (Nd, ρd) for Nd defaults
and on the cumulative distribution function D(i, ρd) are discussed. The latter means
the average loss rate of the“tranche” (layered structure ) of the securities (e.g. CDO),
which are synthesized from a pool of many assets. We show that the expected loss rate
of the subordinated tranche decreases with ρd and that of the senior tranche increases
linearly, which are important in their pricing and ratings.

1. Introduction

The statistical properties of the models for credit risks have been widely discussed in
the past ten years from the standpoint of ﬁnancial engineering [1, 2] and econophysics
[3, 4].
In the context of econophysics, the mechanism of systemic failure in banking
has been studied [5, 6]. Power law behavior of the distributions of avalanches and
several scaling laws in the context of percolation theory were found. On the other hand,
in ﬁnancial engineering, the evaluation of the eﬀect of the correlation ρ between the
rates of return of assets or between the default of assets is a hot topic and is widely
discussed from theoretical and empirical viewpoints. Empirically, historically realized
values of correlations and their implied values, which are estimated based on the market
value of credit derivatives, are compared and their discrepancies, called correlation risk
premium, attract investors’ interests from the viewpoint of portfolio management [7].
Theoretically, many statistical models are proposed for modeling credit risk of the pool
of many assets [2, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. There are two categories in the models.
The models in the ﬁrst category use two state discrete variables which describe whether
the asset is defaulted or not [9, 10, 5, 11]. In the ﬁnancial literature a two-valued variable
xi(i = 1,
, N) takes values 0 and 1 depending on whether the i-th asset described by
xi is not defaulted or defaulted. The default probability Pd is deﬁned by the average
number of defaulted assets Nd per an asset as Pd = <Nd>
N . Here < > means the
1 is also used and it is related to x as
expectation value.
2x. Moody’s Binomial (Expansion) approach [9], Moody’s correlated Binomial
S = 1
model [10], Long-range Ising model [11] are in this category. The default correlation is
deﬁned by the simultaneous default probability. If we denote the probability distribution
of two asset i, j as Pij(xi, xj), the default correlation ρd is deﬁned by

Here, Pi(xi) and Pj(xj) are the probability distributions of xi and xj and they are
calculated from the joint probability distribution Pij(xi, xj).

In the second category, the models adopt a continuous variable for the earning rate
of an asset and correlation between the earning rates is introduced [8, 12, 13, 14]. On the
assumption that the earing rates obey multivariate normal distribution with correlation
ρa, the probability Pi,j for the simultaneous default of the i-th and j-th assets is given

(1). The conditionally independent model [12], such as the Merton based model, the
credit metrix model [13] and the copula model [14] are in the second category.

The reason why default or asset correlations are widely discussed recently is that the
pricing of Asset backed Security (ABS), like CDO, needs detailed information about the
probabilities P (Nd) for Nd defaults. Here CDO is an abbreviation for Collateralised debt
obligation, which is a ﬁnancial innovation to securitise portfolios of defaultable assets.
The portfolio of the underlying debts (assets) collateralizes the securitites (obligations),
CDO is a kind of ABS. Securitization by CDO, we mean to synthesize securities based
In the
on a pool of many assets, like loans (CLO), commercial bonds (CBO) etc.
process, layered structure is introduced and securities with high priority (reliability),
which is called senior tranche, and those with low priority (called subordinated tranche
or equity) are synthesized. Between the senior tranche and the equity, the mezzanine
tranche with middle priority is also synthesized. The diﬀerence between them is that
if some of the assets in the pool are defaulted, the security with lower priority loses its
value at ﬁrst. If the rate of defaulted assets Nd
N exceeds some threshold value Pc, e.g.
Pc = 7% for the mezzanie tranche and Pc = 10% for the senior tranche, those with
higher priority begin to lose their values. The equity play the role of “shock absorber”.
By the “tranche” structure, the risk of the senior tranche is reduced and investors feel
safe about the investment. On the other hand, the interest rates of the securities of the
equity and the mezzanine tranche are set to be higher than those of the senior tranche
and the subordinated tranches are high-risk-high-return products.

Pd)

NPd(1

The default correlation becomes important when one try to estimate the expected
loss in each tranche, which is essential in the evaluation of its price (premium). For
example, we assume a pool of N homogeneous assets with default probability Pd. If
there is no correlation between the defaults, P (Nd) is the binomial distribution B(N, Pd)
√NPd for
and has a peak at Nd = PdN. The standard deviation is
small Pd. If the threshold value Pc is large enough, the upper tranche does not suﬀer
from the defaults in the pool. On the other hand, in the extreme case where the default
correlation is ρd = 1, all assets behave in the same way and there are only two cases. One
Pd. The
case is that all assets are not defaulted and the probability for the case is 1
other case is that all assets are defaulted simultaneously and the probability is Pd. In the
strong correlation limit (ρd = 1), when there occur defaults, all assets become defaulted
simultaneously. Both senior and subordinated tranches lose their values completely. If
there occurs no default, both tranche does not suﬀer from any damage. The essential
problem is to know the ρd dependence of the probabilities P (Nd). It is important to
estimate the expected loss rate of each tranche based on P (Nd). In addition, we should
also study which probabilistic model is good or useful in order to describe the behaviors
of the assets.

This paper deals with these problems. The organization of the paper is as follows.
In section 2, we study the (J, H) phase diagram of ﬁnite size long-range Ising model
and show that the assets begin to be correlated in the “Two Peak” Phase in the (J, H)
plane. The realistic magnitude of the default correlation ranges from 1 % to several %

Evaluation of Tranche in Securitization

[2], only the Two Peak Phase is interesting from the ﬁnancial engineering viewpoint.
Section 3 is devoted to the calculation of the important parameter Pd and ρd in terms of
J, H and N. Here, we develop a perturbation method which is based on the discussions
in section 2. Up to zero-th order in the perturbation theory, P (Nd) is expressed as the
superposition of two binomial distributions, corresponding to the two peaks of P (Nd).
The developed method and obtained relations are useful when one apply the long-range
Ising model to the evaluation and hedging of the securities with tranches. In section 4,
we study the ρd dependence of P (Nd, ρd) and of the expected loss rates of the tranches.
For the latter purpose, we introduce the cumulative distribution D(i, ρd) and discuss
that they are directly related with the average loss rates of tranches. As the correlation
becomes strong (with ﬁxed default probability Pd), the left peak becomes taller and
moves towards to the origin (Nd = 0). The right peak also becomes taller and shifts
to Nd = N.
Its area approaches to Pd as ρd comes close to 1. These behaviors are
diﬀerent from those of the binomial expansion approach, where P (Nd) has only one
peak and its shape becomes broader as ρd increases. We then discuss the ρd dependence
of D(i, ρd). D(i) for large i increases linearly with ρd and the senior tranche cannot
avoid the default damage of the assets pool, even when we set Pc to be large. This
crucial behavior of the long-range Ising model has been pointed out previously [11], we
have clariﬁed the importance in the evaluation of the tranches. Section 5 is dedicated
to concluding remarks and future problems. We discuss the usefulness of the long-range
Ising model from the viewpoint of ﬁnancial engineering.

the assets is assumed to be described by the following canonical distribution with the
long-range Ising model of a ﬁnite system with N spins and the exchange interaction

where the spin variable represents the states of the assets, the default probability Pd is
at most a few percent and almost all assets are not defaulted (S = 1). The sign of the
external ﬁeld H is set to be H > 0.

The reason to choose the long-range Ising model

is that it gives the default
distribution P (Nd) directly. In [11], another motivation for the long-range Ising model

has been discussed and their conclusion is that the model is the most natural choice from
the viewpoint of the Maximum Statistical Entropy principle. The two parameters J and
H are introduced as Lagrange multipliers which ensure that the default probability and
the default correlation of the model are pd and ρd. From the economical viewpoint,
we can interpret the model as a kind of factor model. Here, the term ’factor’ means
the systematic risk factor or the state of the business cycle [2]. In a boom, we have
fewer defaults than in a recession. We denote the state of the business cycle as H ′
and assume that the defaults of the assets are independent from each other, conditional
on the realization of the systematic factor H ′. The joint probabilities for the assets

Here, the random variable H ′ obeys the probability density function P (H ′) and the

The default probability Pd is a decreasing function of H and H for a boom (recession)
is large (small). In order to derive the long-range Ising model starting from the above
factor mode, we assume that H ′ obeys the standard normal distribution with mean H

[11]. The probability Pall plays a crucial role when one discuss the evaluation of the
tranche.

When one calculate Pd, ρd, one way is to calculate < Si > and < SiSj >. Here,
we calculate the moment of Nd with the probability distribution eq.(8). The default

4. Eﬀect of ρd on P (Nd) and on average loss rates of tranches

We would like to discuss the eﬀect of default correlation ρd on the probabilities P (Nd)
and on the tranche synthesized from the pool of the homogeneous assets. In order to
discuss the latter case, we introduce the cumulative distribution function D(i, ρd), which
is directly related with the average loss rate of the tranche. The default rate Pd and the
system size N is ﬁxed. When we show numerical data, we set N = 100 and Pd = 0.05.
At ﬁrst, we discuss the former case, the eﬀect on the probabilities P (Nd, ρd). Here
we write down their ρd dependence explicitly. The ρd = 0 case is easy and P (Nd, 0) is
only the binomial distribution B(N, Pd). It has a single peak at NPd and the width
Pd)N and as ρd becomes large,
is roughly 2√NPd. For Nd = 0, P (0, 0) = (1
P (0, ρd) approaches 1

The system size N = 100 and Pd = 0.05. P (0, ρd) grows monotonically as ρd grows.

P (0, ρd) is the probability of the

The tranche for the interval [i, j] implies that if the number of default Nd is below
i (Nd < i), the tranche does not suﬀer from any damage. However, if Nd exceeds or
becomes equal to i (Nd

Now we discuss the eﬀect of the default correlation ρd on E(i) = D(i, ρd). From the
N
deﬁnition D(i, ρ) =
k=i P (k, ρd), we can understand the ρd dependence easily from the
previous discussions on P (Nd, ρd). In ﬁgure 7, we show D(i, ρd) for 91
100. The
area of the second peak increases monotonically to Pd as we increase ρd, the cumulative
distributions D(i, ρd) also grow up to Pd. P (Nd, ρd) is almost zero for 11
90,
90 behaves in the same way with these D(i, ρd) for i = 91. If
D(i, ρd) for 11
i becomes small, we see the contribution from the ﬁrst peak in P (Nd, ρd). For small
= 0 with respect to ρd dominates the contribution
i, the damps of P (Nd, ρd) for Nd
P (0, ρd)
from the second peak. P (0, ρd) increases monotonically and D(1, ρd) = 1
decreases with ρd. D(i, ρd) for i
2 also decreases as in ﬁgure 8, which shows D(i, ρd)
for 1
10. These behaviors reﬂect the left shift and the width tinning of the ﬁrst
peak. For the intermediate value of i, the ρd dependence of D(i, ρd) is not monotonous.
In ﬁgure 9, we depict D(i, ρd) for 9
11. Along with the shape change of the ﬁrst
peak with ρd, D(i, ρd) at ﬁrst decrease. Then, the contribution from the second peak
dominates the decrease of the ﬁrst peak contribution and D(i, ρd) begins to increase.
D(i, ρd) is downward convex with respect to ρd for the interval of i.

We note that the ranges where D(i, ρd) is downward convex, D(i, ρd) decreases
monotonically, or D(i, ρd) increases monotonically depends on the parameters N, Pd.
The above discussions may not hold for other values of N and Pd. In particular the
range of the downward convex region, if we set Pd = 0.01, we observe that it shift to

5. Concluding Remarks and Future Problems

≃

In this paper, we have studied the long-range Ising model as a model for a pool of N
homogeneous assets with default probability Pd and default correlation ρd. We have
studied in the (J, H) plane, the behavior of Pd and ρd. There are two phases in the
(J, H) plane. In the One Peak Phase, the probabilities P (Nd) have a single peak at
Nd
NPd. The correlation is almost zero in the phase. In the Two Peak Phase, there
are two peaks in P (Nd) and ρd can take large value. The ﬁrst peak is closer to origin
Pd. The second peak is at about N and its area
than NPd and its area is larger than 1
is less than Pd. The parameters J, H should be chosen in the Two peak phase, if the
model intends to describe the portfolio with some default correlation between the assets.
We have developed the perturbative method and expressed P (Nd) as a superposition of
two binomial distributions with the above two peaks at zero-th order. We have obtained
the closed form expression for Pd, ρd and the weights for the second peak Pall, which
means the probability that almost all assets are defaulted. These expressions are in
good agreement with numerically calculated values and give an eﬃcient method for the
actual application of the long-range Ising model. Otherwise, for Pd and ρd, it is diﬃcult
to know the parameters J and H and the long range Ising model is hard-to-use as a
model for homogeneous credit risk portfolio.

Furthermore, we have studied the ρd dependence of P (Nd, ρd) and the cumulative
distribution D(i, ρd). P (Nd, 0) is binomial distribution B(N, Pd) and it has a peak at
NPd. As we increase ρd from 0 to 1, the proﬁle of P (Nd, ρd) changes from One peak
shape to Two Peak shape. The ﬁrst peak shifts to the left and its shape becomes higher
and narrower. The second peak’s area increases and it shifts to the right with the
decrease of its width. At ρd = 1, P (Nd, 1) has two thin peaks at Nd = 0 and Nd = N
and the probabilities are P (0, 1) = 1
Pd and P (N, 1) = Pd. Other probabilities are
zero. The cumulative distribution functions D(i, ρd) correspond to the average loss rates
of the i-th tranche. About the senior tranche, the range of the tranche [i, j] is large.
As ρd increases, D(i, ρd) increase almost linearly with ρd like D(i, ρd)
Pd. The
average loss rate of the senior tranche [i, j] is given as a sum of D(k, ρd) in the range
Pd.
[i, j], the expectation value of the loss rate of the senior tranche also increases as ρd
The price of the tranche is based on the average loss rate, the value of the senior tranche
decreases with ρd. The range of the equity, the subordinated tranche, is near the origin
and the D(i, ρd)s decrease monotonically. The average loss rate of the equity decreases
with ρd and the price of the equity increase with ρd. The mezzanine tranche is between
the equity and the senior tranche. The proﬁle of D(i, ρd) in the range depends on the
model parameters ρd, Pd and N. In the text example, D(i, ρd) has a downward convex
shape in some region. If the mezzanine range [i, j] is chosen to lie in the region, the
average loss rate also behaves similarly. However, other probabilistic model for a pool
of assets, e.g. the copula model [14], suggest upward convex shape for the average loss
of the mezzanine tranche. The discrepancy comes from the diﬀerence of the shapes of
P (Nd, ρd). The more complete comparison between the probabilistic models for a pool

of correlated assets should be done.

As concluding remarks, we comment on the usage of the long-range Ising model
and related future problems. As a statistical model for an ensemble of many assets,
the long-range Ising model is an attractive one from the viewpoint of physicists.
Its
phase diagram and phase transitions are throughly studied and its analytic calculation
method, like Hubbard-Stratanovich transformation, guides us how to make theoretically
tractable models. On the other hand, from the viewpoint of ﬁnancial engineers, the long-
range Ising model is not so convenient. One reason is that the model parameters J, H
are not directly related with the observed data Pd and ρd (or ρa). Other statistical
models incorporate these parameters as a model parameters. For example, the Moody’s
correlated binomial model gives P (Nd) as a function of Pd and ρd explicitly. When one
uses Ising model, it is necessary to know the parameters J, H which correspond to Pd, ρd.
The deﬁnition of Pd and ρd include the moments < N l
> or < Si > and < SiSj >, it is
−
necessary to take the trace Tr. The long-range Ising model has the advantage that the
N
j=1 Sj and
trace Tr is reduced to the summation over the total magnetization M =
the calculation is not so heavy task. Even so, this one step spoils the usefulness of the
model. We have obtained a closed form expressions for Pd and ρd and try to circumvent
the step. The computational time to obtain J, H for given Pd, ρd is reduced much and
the failing of the model are partially overcome.

P

In order to apply the long-range Ising model to the evaluation of the tranche [i.j]
in more realistic situation, the assumption of homogeneity of the assets pool should be
weakened. One step toward the direction is to introduce multi sectors and assume the
homogeneity only in each sector. We label each sector by I = 1, 2,
K and I-th sector
contains N I assets. In the I-th sector, the default rate is P I
d and the default correlation
is ρI
d. Between diﬀerent sectors, say between I-th and J-th sector, the default correlation
is ρIJ
d . We use Ising Spin variables SI
j to represent the states of the j-th asset in the I-th
sector, the generalized long-range Ising model Hamiltonian for the probabilities P (SI

The problem is to get the relation between ρI
In order
to accomplish the task, the phase diagram in J IJ , J I, H I and the proﬁle P (N I
d ) should
be cleared and it is left for future analysis. Furthermore, for more complex situation
where i-th asset has default probability P i
d and the default correlation between i-th and
j-th asset is ρij
d , the model Hamiltonian becomes that of the random Ising spin systems.
The exchange interaction Jij and the external ﬁeld Hi should be connected to P i
d and
ρij
d , which is also left for future problem. Other step is to discard the Ising model and
adopt other probabilistic models. One possibility is the Moody’s correlated binomial

model, which uses two state variables x = 0, 1 for the state of an asset and incorporates
Pd and ρd directly in the model parameters. Its generalization to the multi-sector case
and more complex situations is an interesting problem. Other possibility is to introduce
simpliﬁed version of the long-range Ising model. We use two state variable xi for the
N
state of the i-th asset. The number of defaults Nd is expressed as Nd =
j=1 xj. The

Abstract

In this paper we address the question of the size distribution of ﬁrms. To this aim, we use the

Bloomberg database comprising ﬁrms around the world within the years 1995-2003, and analyze

the data of the sales and the total assets of the consolidation base of the Japanese and the US

companies, and make a comparison of the size distributions between the Japanese companies and

the US companies. We ﬁnd that (i) the size distribution of the US ﬁrms is approximately log-

normal, in agreement with Gibrat’s observation [1], and in contrast (ii) the size distribution of

the Japanese ﬁrms is clearly not log-normal, and the upper tail of the size distribution follows the

Pareto law. It agree with the predictions of the Simon model [6].

INTRODUCTION

There is a long tradition in the studies on the size distribution of ﬁrms since Robert

Gibrat[1] presented the ﬁrst model of the dynamics of ﬁrm size and industry structure.

Gibrat postulated the following simplest stochastic process to explain the skew distribution

of ﬁrm’s size. Le us consider a stochastic process

x(t)

indexed by time t = 0, 1, ..., where

x(t) is the ﬁrm’s size at time t. Let ε(t) be an identically and independently distributed ran-

dom variable denoting the growth rate between period t

1 and t. If growth is proportionate,

then

where ln(1 + ε(t))

the central limit theorem, lnx(T ) is asymptotically normal distributed, and hence x(T ) is

ε(t). As a result, it follows that lnx(T ) = lnx(0) + PT

≈

asymptotically lognormally distributed, provided the shocks are independently distributed

and small.

In other words, in line with Gibrat’s proposition, a proportionate stochastic

growth process leads to the lognormal distribution. There is considerable evidence that the

size distribution of ﬁrms is log-normal[1-5].

On the other hand, the other empirical studies show that the size distribution of ﬁrms is

approximated closely by the Pareto distribution [6-12]. Moreover, recent empirical studies

[13-17] show that the survival function of ﬁrm size follows a power law with an exponent

which is close to unity, so-called the Zipf’s law [19]. With respect to the distribution of ﬁrm’s

size, Fujiwara, et. al. [16] and Aoyama, et. al. [17] propose a resolution of the puzzle and

show that proportionate growth processes can generate Zipf’s law@ [20]. The purpose of

this paper is to reinvestigate the statistical properties of the size distribution of ﬁrms using

a comprehensive database of corporate ﬁnance. To this aim, we use the Bloomberg database

comprising ﬁrms around the world within the years 1995-2003, and analyze the data of the

sales and the total assets of the consolidation base of the Japanese and the US companies,

and make a comparison of the size distributions between the Japanese companies and the

US companies. We ﬁnd that (i) the size distribution of the US ﬁrms is approximately log-

normal, in agreement with Gibrat’s observation [1], and in contrast (ii) the size distribution

of the Japanese ﬁrms is clearly not log-normal, and the upper tail of the size distribution

II. DATA ANALYSIS

A. Corporate ﬁnancial data

The database used is the corporate ﬁnancial data of companies around the world provided

by Bloomberg Ltd. In this paper we use the data of sales and total assets of annual data of

11 years from 1992 to 2003 of the stand-alone ﬁnancial statement. We analyze the data of

the Japanese companies and of the U.S. companies. The number of companies collected to

the database has changed every year as shown in table 1.

Our aim is to determine if the size distribution of ﬁrms follows the log-normal distribution

that is created from the stochastic process proposed by Gibrat [1]. To this aim, we take

logarithm of sales and total assts, and standardize the data,

If the variable of the ﬁrm’s size X has the log-normal distribution, then the standardized

variable Z has a standard normal distribution,

deﬁned over the interval (

). We perform normality tests which determine if a

, +

∞

sample of data of standardized variable z ﬁts a standard normal distribution below. As a

normality test we select the ones that are best known, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and

the Chi-square test. These tests compares the cumulative distribution of the data with the

expected cumulative normal distribution[21].

B. The size distribution of the US companies

1. The sales

The best way to evaluate how far your data are from the normal distribution is to look at

a graph and see if the distribution deviates grossly from the standard normal distribution.

First of all, we standardize the data of the sales of the U.S. companies. The standardized

sales S is deﬁned as

S =

(lns

µs)

.

−
σs

(5)

where s denotes the annual sales, and µs, the mean of the logarithm of s, and σs, the variance

of the logarithm of s. Figure 1(a) shows the probability density function of the standardized

sales S of the US companies for each of years in the 1995-2003 period. The probability

density function is deﬁned by P (S). If the distribution of the sales s is log-normal, then the

distribution of S is normal. The solid line shows a standard normal distribution. We can

tell at a glance that the lower tail of the distribution of the standardized sales S is long,

but the upper tail of the distribution of S is short relative to normal. Figure 1(b) shows the

survival function of the standardized sales S of the U.S. companies deﬁned by P (S > x).

The ﬁgure also show that the upper tail of the distribution of the standardized sales S is

short compared with the normal distribution.

Next, we make certain of this point using the normal probability plot that is a graphical

technique for assessing whether or not a data set is approximately normally distributed.

Figure 2 shows the normal probability plot for the standardized sales S of the 10481 US

companies in 1998. The data are plotted against a theoretical normal distribution in such a

way that the points should form an approximate straight line. Departures from this straight

line indicate departures from normality. The ﬁrst few points show increasing departure from

the ﬁtted line below the line and last few points show increasing departure from the ﬁtted

line below the line. It means that the tail of the distribution of the standardized sales S

is long in the lower tail and is short in the upper-tail relative to the normal distribution.

This agrees with the empirical result by [4][22]. We have done same analysis for each of

the 9 year period from 1995 to 2003, and obtained similar results. Thus, we can reasonably

conclude that the normal distribution does not provide an adequate ﬁt for this data set of

the standardized sales S.

Finally we perform the two statistical tests for normality, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test

and the Chi-square test. In Table 2 the test statistics is summarized along with the kurutosis

and the skewness of the distribution of the standardized sales. Note that KS test is the

Kolmogorov-Smyrnov statistic for the null hypothesis of normality and CS test is the Chi-

square test for the null hypothesis of normality; The ﬁgures in parentheses are the p-value of

the test which denotes the smallest signiﬁcance level at which a null hypothesis of normality

can be rejected. The null hypothesis, that the population distribution is normal, is rejected

for large values of both of the test statistics.

It is known that for the normal distribution, the population kurutosis is 3 and skewness

is 0, the distribution of the standardized sales S are skewed to the left because the skewness

is negative. In all cases, the p-value of the test statistics is equal to zero, so that the tests

reject the null hypothesis of normality.

In brief, the sales distribution of the U.S. ﬁrms is not the log-normal, and is skewed to

5

the left relative to the log-normal distribution, and the upper tail is short and the lower tail

is long relative to the tail of the log-normal distribution.

2. The total assets

Figure 3(a) and Figure 3(b) show the probability density function and the survival func-

tion of of the standardized total-assets A. The standardized total assets A is deﬁned as

A =

(lna

µa)

.

−
σa

(6)

where a denotes the total assets, and µa, the mean of the logarithm of a, and σa, the variance

of the logarithm of a. The solid line shows a standard normal distribution. The ﬁgures seem

to show that both of the lower tail and the upper tail of the distribution of the standardized

sales A is slightly fat compared with the normal distribution. Figure 4 shows the normal

probability plot for the standardized total assets A in 1998. Visually, the probability plot

shows a strongly linear pattern. The fact that the points in the lower and upper extremes

of the plot do not deviate signiﬁcantly from the straight-line pattern indicates that there

are not any signiﬁcant outliers relative to a normal distribution. We perform the same

analysis for each of the years in the 91995-2003 period and obtain the similar result. The

plot demonstrates that the distribution of the standardized total assets Ais tolerably close

to the standard normal distribution.

These are veriﬁed by the results of the tests for normality that are summarized in Table

3. We should note that the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test accepts the normality hypothesis for

1997 data and 1998 data at the 0.1 signiﬁcance level.

In brief, we can not reject that the distribution of the total assets A for the US companies

is the log-normal distribution.

C. The size distribution of the Japanese companies

In this subsection we investigate the shape of the distributions of the sales and total

assets for the Japanese companies.

TABLE III: Summary statistics on the standardized total-assets A of the US companies

1. The sales

Figure 5(a) and Figure 5(b) show the probability density function and the survival func-

tion of the standardized sales S for the Japanese companies for years in the 1995-2003 period.

The solid line shows a standard normal distribution. We can tell at a glance that the upper

tail of the distribution of S is long relative to normal.

Figure 6 shows the normal probability plot for the 1998 sales. The actual plot lies below

the theoretical plot for the lower tail, and the actual plot lies above the theoretical plot for

the upper tail. It means that the 1998 data of the standardized sales S of the Japanese

companies has long tails relative to the normal distribution. We perform the same analysis

for each of the years in the 91995-2003 period and obtain the similar result.

The statistics is summarized in Table 4. Since the skewness is positive, the distribution

of the standardized sales S are skewed to the right relative to normal distribution. This is

opposite to the result of the U.S. companies. In all cases, the p-value of the test statistics

of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and the Chi-square test are equal to zero. Thus, the tests

clearly reject the null hypothesis of normality of the distributions of S.

We can conclude that the tails, particularly the upper tail, of the sales distribution of the

Japanese companies is long relative to the log-normal distribution.

2. The total assets

Figure 7(a) and Figure 7(b) show the probability density function and the survival func-

tion of the standardized total asset A of the Japanese companies for each of years in the

1995-2003 period. We can tell at a glance that the upper tail of the distribution of A is

apparently fat relative to normal.

Figure 8 shows the normal probability plot for the 1998 total asset. The normal proba-

bility plot indicates that the ﬁrst few points show increasing departure from the ﬁtted line

above the line and last few points show increasing departure from the ﬁtted line above the

line. It means that for the 1998 data of the standardized total asset of the Japanese com-

panies the lower tail of the distribution is short and the lower tail is longer relative to the

normal distribution. We perform the same analysis for each of the years in the 91995-2003

period. We obtain that the upper tail of the distribution of the standardized total-assets A

is fat relative to the normal.

The statistics is summarized in Table 5. Since the skewness is positive, the distribution

of the standardized total asset A is skewed to the right relative to normal distribution. In all

cases, the p-value of the test statistics of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and the Chi-square

test are equal to zero. Thus, the tests clearly reject the null hypothesis of normality of

the distributions. We can conclude that the upper tail of the total-asset distribution of the

III. CONCLUSION

In this paper we investigate the size distribution of ﬁrm. In particular, we compare the

size distributions of ﬁrms in Japan and in the U.S. with the log-normal distribution.

In

summary, we ﬁnd the size distributions of the Japanese ﬁrms are not log-normal, and the

total-assets distributions seem to follow a power-law in the upper tail. On the other hand,

the size distribution of the US ﬁrms is well approximated by the log-normal distribution.

Our ﬁndings make it clear that there is not universality of the size distribution of ﬁrms.

The question is the reasons why the shape of the size distribution of the Japanese ﬁrms is

diﬀerent from those of the US ﬁrms. It calls for further consideration.

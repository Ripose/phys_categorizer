Citation Distributions in High Energy
Physics

The probability that a given paper in the
SPIRES data base has x citations is well de-
scribed by simple power laws, P (x) ∝ x−α,
with α ≈ 1.2 for x less than 50 citations and
α ≈ 2.3 for 50 or more citations. A con-
sideration of citation distribution by subﬁeld
shows the data base to be remarkably homo-
geneous. We demonstrate the extreme im-
probability that the citation records of se-
lected individuals and institutions have been
obtained by a random draw on the resulting
distribution.

It has been recognized since the early 1970s that
citations can provide a quantitative measure of sci-
entiﬁc excellence [1]. Many studies (e.g., [2] and
references therein) have shown that this tool must
be used with considerable care. Diﬀerent scientiﬁc
environments have diﬀerent publishing and citation
habits, and these diﬀerences must be reconciled be-
fore comparisons can be made across ﬁeld bound-
aries. Nevertheless, citation studies have become a
standard measure for the evaluation of journal im-
pact or of the quality of university departments.

In this article we present the results of a study
of the SLAC SPIRES data base1. To be speciﬁc,
the data used below was retrieved from the SPIRES
mirror at Durham University on August 14, 2002.
We will henceforth refer to this as the SPIRES data
base. Since the SPIRES data base is dedicated to
papers in high energy physics, it is natural to as-
sume that it is relatively homogeneous. One of
the purposes of the present work is to determine
the extent to which citation patterns in the cat-
egories of theory, phenomenology, experiment, in-
strumentation, and reviews are in fact comparable.
We will then present the citation probability for the
SPIRES data base.

Table 1: The probability of a paper in the SPIRES
data base having x citations for 0 ≤ x ≤ 4 as a
function of subﬁeld. The total number of papers
in each subﬁeld is: 159,946 (theory), 68,549 (phe-
nomenology), 28,527 (experiment), 19,637 (instru-
mentation), and 5,058 (review articles). The “to-
tal” data entries are obtained directly from the sub-
ﬁeld data. The total number of papers in the data
set is 281,717.

The citation distribution

Basic statistics

The SPIRES data base contains 501,531 papers.
Of these papers there are 196,432 non-journal pa-
pers (e.g. preprints and conference proceedings) for
which citation information is not available. A frac-
tion of the remaining papers seem to have been re-
moved from the data base. In other cases, subﬁeld
designations are not available. Thus, we have re-
stricted our attention in the following to the 281,717
papers (i.e. roughly 56% of the SPIRES data base)
for which both citation information and subﬁeld
designations are available. Table 1 shows the prob-
ability, P (x), of a SPIRES paper receiving x cita-
tions for 0 ≤ x ≤ 4. An “atomic” histogram of the
full citation data is shown in Figure 1.

One of the most striking features of this data set
is the large number of papers (some 29%) which are
uncited. Note that we have not applied any correc-
tion for self-citation. The removal of self-citations

pers in our sample are cited 10 times or less.
In
contrast, 6.2% of the papers have 50 citations or
more and only 131 papers (≈ 0.05%) are cited 1000
times or more. The mean number of citations per
paper in this sample is 14.6, which is considerably
larger than the median of 2.3 citations, implying
that a paper with the average number of citations
is substantially more cited than the “average” pa-
per. The large factor between mean and median
citations suggests that the distribution has a very
long tail with a small fraction of highly cited papers
accounting for a signiﬁcant fraction of all citations.
This is indeed the case. Approximately 50% of all
citations are generated by the top 4% of the all pa-
pers; the lowest 50% of papers generates only 2%
of all citations. The rates of citation production by
these two parts of the data set diﬀer by a factor of
approximately 310. These observations regarding
citations in SPIRES suggest that the distribution
of citations follows a power law. As we shall see,
this is qualitatively correct.

Past investigations

Given the level of interest in citation data and com-
plex networks, surprisingly few serious studies of
citation data have been performed by physicists.
In 1957 Shockley [3] argued that the publication
rate for the scientiﬁc staﬀ at Brookhaven National
Laboratory was described by a log-normal distribu-
tion. In 1998, Laherrere and Sornette [4] suggested
that the number of papers with x citations, N (x),
of the 1120 topcited physicists from 1981 to 1997
is described by a stretched exponential (N (x) ∝
exp[−(x/x0)β], β ≈ 0.3). Note however that this
study focuses on the total number of citations of
topcited authors and not on the distribution of ci-
tations of publication as is the case in the present
paper. Also in 1998, Redner [5] considered data on
papers published in 1981 in journals catalogued by
the ISI as well as data from Phys. Rev. D vols. 11-50
and concluded that the large-x citation distribution
is described by a power-law such that N (x) ∝ x−α
with α ≈ 3.

In the present paper, the statistical material is
of a much higher quality than in the papers men-
tioned above. The ISI data set studied in [5] is con-
siderably larger (783,339 papers) than the present
SPIRES data set. However, the ISI data used by
Redner contains papers published in a single year in
a variety of scientiﬁc disciplines (including medicine,

biology, chemistry, physics, etc.). There are neither
a priori arguments nor data to indicate that cita-
tion patterns in these ﬁelds are suﬃciently uniform
to justify their treatment as a single data set. The
SPIRES hep data is collected from a well-deﬁned
area within physics, i.e. high energy physics, and
has been accumulated systematically by the SLAC
library since 1962.

Figure 1 shows a log-log representation of the
distribution of citations in the SLAC SPIRES data
base. The data suggest that this distribution is re-
markably well described by two power laws. The
distribution, N (x), is approximately proportional
to (x + 1)−1.3 for 0 ≤ x ≤ 50 and to (x + 1)−2.3
for x > 50. Before turning to a more quantita-
tive description, we consider the homogeneity of the
SPIRES data.

Homogeneity of the data base

Even though the SPIRES data base is devoted ex-
clusively to papers in high energy physics, it is rel-
atively easy to imagine mechanisms which could
lead to diﬀerent citation patterns in the ﬁve dif-
ferent subﬁelds into which the SPIRES data base
is divided; these ﬁelds are theory, experiment, phe-
nomenology, reviews, and instrumentation. Exper-
iments in high energy physics are expensive and
manpower intensive. Program committee approval
is tantamount to a pre-review of the work. The
number of co-authors is large. Under such condi-

tions, it might be reasonable to expect rather fewer
minimally cited papers. By contrast, the number of
co-authors of papers in the theory and phenomenol-
ogy sections of SPIRES is far smaller, and the rel-
atively low cost of such work permits the produc-
tion of papers which might not survive meticulous
pre-reviewing. In short, theory and phenomenology
subﬁelds might have a larger probability for mini-
mal citation. Similarly, one could argue that review
papers, which are often “commissioned” by journals
and frequently written by recognized experts, might
enjoy higher citation rates—just as one could con-
ceive of mechanisms such that the instrumentation
subﬁeld might include more minimally cited papers.
With such a priori expectations, it is of obvious
importance to determine citation distributions sep-
arately for each subﬁeld. Fortunately, SPIRES is
well-suited for such a study.

Some indications of the diﬀerences between the
ﬁve categories can be seen from Table 1. The proba-
bility of having ≤ 4 citations is 59.9, 53.6, 51.2, 47.7,
and 86.5% for theory, experiment, phenomenology,
reviews, and instrumentation, respectively. While
the fraction of minimally cited review papers is clear-
ly smaller than that for the full data set, this eﬀect
is not dramatic. Instrumentation papers, however,
stand out. The probability that an instrumentation
paper will receive ≥ 5 citations is almost 3 times
smaller than that for the full data. The diﬀerences
between citation probabilities in theory, experiment
and phenomenology are surprisingly small. These
trends are supported by the full data set. We ﬁnd,
for example, that only 146 of the 19,637 instrumen-
tation papers (≈ 0.7%) have 50 or more citations.
This is to be compared with 6.2% for the full data
set. By contrast, approximately 14% of review pa-
pers have ≥ 50 citations. The 3% of review papers
with ≥ 1000 citations is signiﬁcantly larger than
the probability of 0.05% for the complete data set.
In short, instrumentation and review papers, which
account for some 9% of the full data set, clearly fol-
low diﬀerent citation distributions. This can reﬂect
a diﬀerent underlying dynamical picture for cita-
tions in these categories; it can also be an indication
that review papers have a higher average quality
and instrumentation papers a lower. Whatever the
explanation, we choose to exclude these two small
categories from further consideration. Had it been
our intention to use citation data as a measure of
scientiﬁc quality, the decision should not be made so
lightly. Ultimately it must be based on a subjective
evaluation of the relative quality and importance of
papers published in the various categories.

theory (N), phenomenology ((cid:4)), and experiment

The homogeneity of citation patterns in the cat-
egories of theory, experiment and phenomenology is
supported by the binned histograms show in Figure
2. Given the logarithmic scale of this ﬁgure, the
three distributions are essentially indistinguishable
over the full range of 0 to 5000 citations. This agree-
ment is remarkable in view of the fact that it per-
sists over almost seven orders of magnitude. Phe-
nomenology and experiment are in the best agree-
ment with a maximum discrepancy of some 15%
found in the vicinity of x = 50. The maximum
discrepancy of approximately 50% between theory
and the other two categories is also found in the
vicinity of x = 50 with somewhat smaller discrep-
ancies for other values of x. It would be valuable
to know if these diﬀerences are “statistically signiﬁ-
cant”. To this end, it is tempting to assign errors in
each bin proportional to the square root of the num-
ber of papers in each bin and perform a χ2 ﬁt. This
temptation should be resisted. The assumption re-
quired for such an exercise to be meaningful is, of
course, that the data in the various bins is statisti-
cally independent. This assumption, which can be
demonstrated to be false, is in evident contradiction
with our reason for studying citation distributions
in the ﬁrst place: We believe that there is a pos-
itive correlation between the intrinsic quality of a
scientiﬁc paper and the number of citations which
it receives, and we also believe that “good” papers
are produced by “good” scientists. The consistency
of these three data sets is, however, suﬃcient for
many applications. In the following, we will work
with this ﬁnal data set of 257,022 articles. The re-
sulting distribution is shown in Figure 3.

source of inhomogeneity in the SPIRES data base.
The distribution of the number of authors who have
written y papers is a monotonically decreasing func-
tion of y. Approximately 91% of the individual au-
thors in the theory data set have written a total
of less than 20 papers. Presumably, this eﬀect is
due to the large number of young physicists who
leave academic physics either immediately following
their PhD or relatively soon after. Thus, we have
also considered citation probabilities for papers col-
lected author-by-author. The reason we have solely
considered the theory subset is that the author-by-
author data unavoidably weighs papers by the num-
ber of coauthors. As we have noted earlier the the-
ory subset has fewer authors per paper (typically
1-3) than for instance the experiment subset where
some papers have hundreds of authors. For the the-
ory data, the resulting distribution is similar to that
of Figure 3, but not identical. The virtue of such
an author-by-author approach is that it allows us to
exclude authors on the basis of the total number of
papers they have produced. For example, we have
compared the citation distributions of papers by all
authors with that of papers written (or co-written)
by authors with more than 20 total papers. The dif-
ferences are extremely small (i.e., similar to those
seen in Figure 2) and again indicated the striking
homogeneity of the SPIRES data base.

The form of the distribution

Having established the homogeneity of the bulk of
the data base, we now turn to a closer look at the
form of the distribution. It is clear from the ﬁgures
that the distribution cannot be described by a sin-
gle power law over the entire range of citations. It

is, however, approximated well by two independent
power laws in the low (x ≤ 50) and high (x > 50)
domains. Thus, P (x) ≈ (1 + x)−α in each region
with α< = 1.20 and α> = 2.31. If we insist on a
relative normalization such that the two forms are
equal at x = 50 and chose the global normalization
to ensure that the total probability is 1, the data is
reproduced with surprising accuracy.

We believe that these diﬀerent power laws prob-
ably reﬂect diﬀerences in the underlying dynamics
of citations in the high and low citation regions.
That diﬀerent dynamics rule the two regimes seems
clear. The bulk of the papers in the minimally
cited part of the distribution are “dead” in the sense
that they have not been cited within the last year
or more (and will probably never be cited again).
Of course, this part of the distribution also con-
tains vigorous young papers of high quality whose
citation count is increasing. However, dead papers
vastly outnumber the live population. In the highly
cited region, virtually all papers are still alive, with
even the oldest of them acquiring new citations reg-
ularly. It seems highly likely that citation patterns
for such papers are quite diﬀerent from those of min-
imally cited papers that are most often cited only by
the author and close colleagues. Further consider-
ations regarding the temporal evolution of citation
networks can be found in [5] and for the SPIRES
hep data base in particular, in a forthcoming paper
by the present authors.

The asymptotic tail

We now consider the large-x tail of the distribution.
Data is too sparse for a direct analysis in the region
of 2000–5000 citations. Thus, in [5] a Zipf plot is
used to highlight this section of the distribution. A
Zipf plot is a plot of the kth ranked paper versus
the number of citations of this paper, Yk. (The most
cited paper is assigned rank 1.) The intuitive rea-
son why the Zipf plot is well suited for analyzing the
large-x data is that it provides much higher resolu-
tion of the high citation end of the distribution. On
a doubly logarithmic scale, the high citation data is
placed at the beginning and is not as compressed as
in the plots of N (x) versus x shown in Figures 1–3.
Figure 4 is a Zipf plot of the ﬁnal data set.

In reference [5] a similar Zipf plot is used to
argue that the large-x tail of the ISI citation ap-
peared to be governed by a power law, 1/x3. This
is not the case for the SPIRES data. Indeed, Figure
4 indicates that the large-x tail of this highly ho-
mogeneous data set is not described by any asymp-

totic power-law. The same conclusion can be drawn
from Figure 3, where a simple power law in the high
citation region tracks the data accurately through
four decades until the data begins to cut oﬀ. Al-
though the high-x data is sparse, one can present
more quantitative indications of this cut oﬀ. If the
power-law seen in ﬁgure 3 applied for arbitrarily
large x, as proposed by [5], we would expect to ﬁnd
33 papers with more than the maximum 5242 cita-
tions actually found in the data set. The most cited
of these papers should have approximately 55,000
citations. Assuming an asymptotic power-law, the
probability of drawing 257,022 papers at random
with no paper having more than 5242 citations is
approximately 10−14.

There is a simple explanation for the large-x
data which seems reasonable for a data set like
SPIRES, which contains a signiﬁcant number of
truly important papers. Papers of high quality and
lasting importance can literally be ‘canonized’ and
pass into the received wisdom of physics which no
longer requires citation. Many theoretical physi-
cists publish about ‘Goldstone bosons’, but few feel
the need to cite the original papers.
Indeed, the
careful reader will stop to think what special point
is being made when Einstein[6] is cited on special
relativity. Since only “mortals” are cited, the power
law must end. In the absence of such a cut oﬀ, refer-
ence [6] should have been cited by 20% of the papers
in SPIRES. This does not seem unreasonable.

mogeneity, it is interesting to show that it can be
put to practical use. Here, we present one such
application. The “citation summary” option in the
SPIRES data base returns the number of papers for
a given author with citations in each of six intervals.
These intervals and the probabilities revealed by our
analysis that papers will fall in these bins are given
in Table 2. The probability, P , that an author’s
actual citation record of M papers was obtained
from a random draw on the citation distribution
is readily calculated by multiplying the probabili-
ties of drawing the author’s number of citations in
the diﬀerent categories, mi, and correcting for the
number of permutations, leading to the multinomial
distribution,

P = M ! Y
i

pmi
i
mi!

.

If a total of M papers were drawn at random on
the citation distribution, the most probable result,
Pmax, would correspond to mi = M pi papers in
each bin. The quantity

r = − log10(P/Pmax) ,

is a useful measure of this probability which is rel-
atively independent of the number of bins chosen.
Since r provides completely objective information
about the probability of drawing a given citation
record at random given knowledge of citation pat-
terns in that ﬁeld, it is particularly well-suited for
comparisons between ﬁelds.
It is equally mean-
ingful to calculate r for authors who publish in
several ﬁelds. The leap from the improbability of

a given author’s citation record to conclusions re-
garding author quality requires certain assumptions
which cannot be tested. For example, to compare
citation records in the instrumentation category with
those in the remainder of our data set, it is neces-
sary to make some a priori assumption about the
relative intrinsic quality of the two data sets. While
the “democratic” assumption of equal intrinsic qual-
ity is easiest, it may or may not be accurate. (In a
Bayesian sense, it is necessary to establish a prior
distribution.)

Consider the following two authors in the SPIRES

data base. Author A has a total of 200 publications
with 17, 70, 82, 23, 8, and 0 publications in each
of the bins above and an average of 26 citations
per article. Author B has a total of 176 publica-
tions with 18, 79, 57, 10, 9, and 3 publications in
each bin and an average of 46. A simple calculation
reveals that r = 18.4 for Author A and 9.9 for Au-
thor B. The minimum value of r is evidently 0. The
maximum value of r in the current data set is found
for Author C, who has a total of 217 publications
with 5, 14, 38, 30, 97, and 33 publications in each
of the bins above and an average of 259 citations
per article. This leads to vastly improbable value
of r = 181.3. With a total of 56224 citations, Au-
thor C accounts for more than 1.5% of all citations
in the data set. There are also indications of less
favorable correlations. Author D has a total of 41
publications with 18, 23, 0, 0, 0, and 0 in each of
the bins above and an average of < 1 citation per
article. This resulting value of r = 4.43 underscores
the fact that an improbable citation record is not
necessarily a “good” one.

Given the total population of authors in SPIRES,
these numbers oﬀer an objective indication of the
extreme improbability that the citation records of
Authors A, B, and C were drawn at random. These
examples are far from exceptional. There are strong
correlations in the citation data, and they merit
quantitative study. The diﬀerences between the Au-
thors A and B can appear surprising at ﬁrst glance
and emphasize the importance of a priori criteria.
Although Author B has an average citation rate al-
most twice that of Author A, his citation record is
more probable by a factor of 108. This is a natu-
ral consequence of the power law distribution which
makes it far more improbable to have 10 papers
with 100 citations each than one paper with 1000
citations. The question of which of these options
is “better” requires a subjective answer, and it is
unlikely that any single quantitative measure will
satisfy everyone. Thus, although the interpretation

of non-statistical ﬂuctuations in individual citation
records is subjective, the likely presence of such ﬂuc-
tuations can be identiﬁed with ease and objectivity.
It is as easy to calculate the r for departments
as for individual authors. Physics Department ∆,
which includes Author C, published a total of 1309
papers from 1980 to 2000, distributed with 81, 324,
474, 175, 216, 39 papers in the citation summary
bins. This results in a r = 285. Physics Depart-
ment Γ, which includes Authors A and B, published
a total of 1309 papers during the same period with
81, 388, 378, 77, 28, 3. This yields the somewhat
smaller value of r = 65.9. Such information can
be of practical value since it is seems likely that
the “most improbable” departments will have the
greatest success in attracting the “most improba-
ble” authors.

Summary and Conclusions

We have considered the distribution of citations for
257,022 articles in the SPIRES data base and demon-
strated the homogeneity of results in the categories
of theory, experiment and phenomenology. Further,
the resulting data set is well described by a simple
power law with diﬀerent exponents in the low and
high citation regions. The most striking features of
the data include the extremely large number of min-
imally cited papers and the fact that a remarkably
small number of papers (4%) account for half of the
citations in the data set. While it is a truism that
progress in physics is driven by a few great minds,
it can be disturbing to confront this quantitatively.
The picture which emerges is thus a small number
of interesting and signiﬁcant papers swimming in a
sea of “dead” papers. This has the practical con-
sequence that any study seeking to understand the
dynamics of interesting papers will be forced to dis-
card most papers and accept the greatly increased
statistical uncertainties. In the case of the SPIRES
data set, this would amount to roughly 10,000 pa-
pers.

In fact, the situation is even more dramatic due
to the strong correlations in the data set when con-
sidered as a function of individual authors or indi-
vidual institutions. As we have seen in the case of
Author C above, a single author accounts for more
than 1.5% of all citations in the SPIRES data set.
Seven authors, not necessarily the highest cited, ac-
count for 6% of all the citations. We have sug-
gested the measure of “unlikelihood”, r, deﬁned
above as a useful indicator of the presence of such
correlations. Further, this measure oﬀers a tool for

supported assumptions and biases.
It is best to
make such assumptions visible and to discuss them.)
It would be extremely valuable to perform “longi-
tudinal” studies of citation data collected as sepa-
rate events. (An “event” here would be the citation
record of a single individual or single institution.)
This would permit a far more systematic study of
the nature of the statistically independent correla-
tions and the probabilities with which they occur.
We emphasize that no single measure, such as
our r or the more traditional average number of ci-
tations per paper, can claim to capture the richness
of either the full citation data set or individual ci-
tation records. While this is obvious from the pres-
ence of strong correlations in the data, it is also sup-
ported by the dramatic diﬀerence between the mean
and median number of citations in the global distri-
butions reported here. For this reason, we believe
that the value of large data bases such as SPIRES
and ISI would be greatly enhanced if global citation
distributions, such as that given in Figure 3 above,
were collected by subﬁeld and made available to the
users of these data bases.

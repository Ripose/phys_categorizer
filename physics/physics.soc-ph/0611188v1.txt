Abstract. Ergodic stationary states of Minority Games with S strategies per agent
can be characterised in terms of the asymptotic probabilities φa with which an agent
uses a of his strategies. We propose here a simple and general method to calculate these
quantities in batch canonical and grand-canonical models. Known analytic theories are
easily recovered as limiting cases and, as a further application, the strategy frequency
problem for the batch grand-canonical Minority Game with S = 2 is solved. The
generalization of these ideas to multi-asset models is also presented. Though similarly
based on response function techniques, our approach is alternative to the one recently
employed by Shayeghi and Coolen for canonical batch Minority Games with arbitrary
number of strategies.

1. Introduction

0, 1, . . . , S

The mathematical theory of Minority Games (MGs) with 2 strategies per agent,
particularly for what concerns their ergodic behaviour, largely rests on the possibility
of separating the contribution to macroscopic quantities coming from “frozen” agents
from that of “ﬁckle” ones [1, 2]. Frozen agents are those who use just one of their
strategies asymptotically, whereas ﬁckle agents ﬂip between their strategies even in the
steady state. That these two groups have diﬀerent impact on the physical properties
of MGs is clear if one thinks that frozen agents are insensitive to small perturbations
and thus they do not contribute to the susceptibility of the system. More generally,
when agents dispose of S > 2 strategies each, the relevant quantity to calculate is the
probability with which an agent uses a of his strategies (a
), knowledge
of which provides all interesting physical observables. On the technical level, this is a
rather complicated problem that has been tackled only recently in [3] for the canonical
S-strategy batch MG. Here we propose an alternative method to derive the desired
statistics in generic canonical or grand-canonical [4] settings with S strategies per agent.
This approach has the advantage of being simpler from a mathematical viewpoint and,
as we will show, easily exportable to other versions of the MG. As in [3], we resort
to path-integral techniques, allowing for a description of the multi-agent dynamics in
terms of the behavior of a single, eﬀective agent subject to a non-trivially correlated
noise. The central idea of the method we propose is to exchange the integration over
the eﬀective noise for one over frequencies using a simple invertible mapping from one
set of variables to the other and the transformation law of probability distributions.
We show that available theories are easily recovered in known cases and, as a further
application, solve the strategy frequency problem for the grand-canonical MG with
S = 2. Since a similar issue arises in the context of multi-asset MGs [5], we also discuss
the (straightforward though heavier from a notational viewpoint) generalisation of this
idea to models in which traders may invest in K

2 assets.

∈ {

}

Since path integrals are by now a somewhat standard technique to deal with MGs,
we shall skip mathematical details and focus our analysis on the resulting eﬀective
dynamics and speciﬁcally on the strategy frequency problem. Moreover, we shall reduce
the discussion of the economic meaning of the model to the minimum. The interested
reader will ﬁnd extensive accounts in [1, 2, 6].

We consider a market for a single asset with N agents, labeled by i

At each time step ℓ, agents receive an information pattern µ(ℓ)
and independently with uniform probability and, based on this, they formulate their bids
(represented simply by a variable encoding the agent’s decision, e.g. to buy or sell the
asset). The most interesting phenomenology is obtained when P scales linearly with N;
their ratio, denoted as α = P/N, is the model’s main control parameter. Every agent i

in either submitting (nisi(ℓ) = 1 for Uisi(ℓ) > 0) or not submitting (nisi(ℓ) = 0 for
Uisi(ℓ) < 0) the bid. This version of the game is usually called grand-canonical MG

It remains to describe how si(ℓ) is chosen. We assume generically that at each time step
agent i employs a rule described by a function gi, namely

si(ℓ) = gi [

Uis(ℓ)

{

}s∈ZS ]

For example, the standard MG with S = 2 corresponds to si(ℓ) = arg maxs∈ZS Uis(ℓ).
(This generalises easily to the case of traders with decision noise [7].) At this stage, we
assume that the gi’s are chosen randomly and independently across agents (from some
distribution) and introduce the density of the mappings

gi}i∈ZN as

{

with δ(F )(

(albeit in general with a diﬀerent and uncorrelated distribution) and we deﬁne their
density as

endowed with S strategies, characterized by score functions Us(t), “spin” variable
s(t) = g [

introducing a generating function of the original dynamics and averaging over disorder

literature (see e.g. [2]). The eﬀective dynamics ultimately reads

strategies [3]. Following sections will address more complicated versions of the model.

3. Canonical batch Minority Game with S strategies

Recalling that for canonical models n = 1, in this section we simplify the notation and
write fs in place of fns. Furthermore, in order to make direct contact with the case
ZS and that the density W [g] is a
discussed in [3], we assume that ǫs = 0 for each s
δ-distribution with

evaluated as follows. Consider the case in which the eﬀective agent uses a subset of

is the probability that n = 0. In this case the value of the frequencies for n = 0 do

model. We proceed to calculate the statistics of the frequencies

if instead u = 0, the agent is sometimes inactive, that is ϕ > 0; ﬁnally if u < 0 then
ϕ = 1 and the agent never invests.

(i) Case u > 0. Here the analysis follows closely the one performed for the canonical

decreases as S increases, which reﬂects the simple fact that the availability of larger

To quantify our ﬁndings we now consider the cases for S = 1 and 2 explicitly.

As usual, we divide the population of N agents into two groups, speculators and
producers. As before, the Np producers have only one strategy and play at every time
step (adopting the notation of [4], we write np = Np/P ), whereas the Ns speculator have
2 strategies each (we write ns = Ns/P ). The equations for c, χ and the fraction φa of
speculators using a strategies (a

6. Summary and outlook

Minority Games with S strategies and/or K assets per agent are intriguing
generalizations of the standard MG setup which display a qualitatively similar
global physical picture (e.g.
regarding the transition with ergodicity breaking) but
substantially richer patterns of agent behaviour, directly related to the enlargement
of the agents’ strategic endowments. The precise characterization of this aspect, even
in the ergodic regime, poses challenging technical problems which have started to be
analysed only recently. The central issue concerns the calculation of the statistics of the
frequencies with which subsets of strategies are used. This problem was ﬁrst tackled in
[3], where an explicit solution is derived in the context of canonical batch MGs. In this
work we have presented an alternative and mathematically simpler solution method
(though the complexity of the calculations still increases rapidly with S). We have
shown speciﬁcally how to recover the theory of the canonical case and solved explicitly
the grand-canonical batch MG with S strategies per agent. The method also generalizes
to the recently introduced multi-asset models.

The method discussed here can be applied to a number of variants of the basic
setup, some of which may be important from an economic viewpoint (for example in
order to study the emergence of cross-asset correlations). Its main limitation is that,
while the eﬀective-agent dynamics, eqn. (10), holds true in both the ergodic and non-
ergodic phases, our futher focus on time-translational properties limits the rigour of
our conclusions to the ergodic regime. The richness of the MG dynamics is actually
most striking when ergodicity is broken. Multi-strategy MGs are likely to produce a
variety of possible steady states that may require novel observables to be completely
characterised. Up to now, our understanding of non-ergodic regimes relies entirely on
ad hoc heuristic arguments (see for instance [8, 11]) which provide a rough picture of
the geometry of steady states and of the role of initial conditions for obtaining states
In our
of high or low volatility, but a more precise characterization remains elusive.
opinion, at the present stage of our theoretical understanding of MGs, any advance in
this direction would be most welcome.

A model for the phenomenological description of tick-by-tick share prices in a stock
exchange is introduced. It is based on mixtures of compound Poisson processes.

1 Introduction

Continuous time random walks (CTRWs) were introduced in Physics by Mon-
troll and Weiss as a model for single-particle (tracer) diﬀusion [1]. An instance
of CTRW, the normal compound Poisson process, had already been used in
the probabilistic theory of insurance ruin since the beginning of the XXth
Century [2,3].

The seminal paper of Montroll and Weiss has been followed by many studies
focusing on anomalous relaxation and anomalous diﬀusion. This is the subject
of two recent reviews by Metzler and Klafter [4,5].

The present author has recently reviewed the applications of CTRWs to Fi-
nance and Economics [6]. These applications were triggered by a series of
papers on ﬁnance and fractional calculus [7,8,9], but the reader is referred to
ref. [10] for an early application of the normal compound Poisson process to
ﬁnancial data.

The recent research of the present author has focused on the behaviour of
waiting times (also known as durations) between trades and order in ﬁnancial
markets [8,11,12,13]. It turned out that interorder and intertrade waiting times
are not exponentially distributed. Therefore, the jump process of tick-by-tick
prices is non-Markovian [8].

In an article within this issue [14], Bianco and Grigolini apply a new method
to verify whether the intertrade waiting time process is a genuine renewal
process [15,16,17]. This was assumed by the CTRW hypothesis in [7]. They
ﬁnd that intertrade waiting times follow a renewal process.

Here, inspired by the work of Edelman and Gillespie [18,19], a phenomeno-
logical model for intraday tick-by-tick ﬁnancial data is presented. It is able to
reproduce some important stylized facts. The paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 contains an outline of the theory of CTRWs. Section 3 contains a
description of the model as well as a discussion on results from Monte Carlo
simulations.

2 Outline of theory

2.1 Basic deﬁnitions

CTRWs are point processes with reward. The point process is characterized
by a sequence of independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) positive random
variables τi, which can be interpreted as waiting times between two consecutive
events:

tn = t0 +

τi;

tn−1 = τn; n = 1, 2, 3, . . . ;

t0 = 0.

(1)

n

Xi=1

tn −

The rewards are i.i.d. not necessarily positive random variables: ξi. In the usual
physical intepretation, they represent the jumps of a random walker, and they
can be n-dimensional vectors. In this paper, only the 1-dimensional case is
studied for a continuous random variable, but the extension of many results
to the n-dimensional case and to a lattice is straightforward. The position x
of the walker at time t is (with N(t) = max
{

and x(0) = 0):

n : tn ≤

t
}

(2)

CTRWs are rather good and general phenomenological models for diﬀusion, in-
cluding anomalous diﬀusion, provided that the time of residence of the walker

x(t) =

ξi.

N (t)

Xi=1

2

is much greater than the time it takes to make a jump. In fact, in this formal-
ism, jumps are instantaneous.

The ﬁnancial interpretation of the random variables is straightforward. If
trades take place in a continuous double auction, both price variations and
waiting times (also called durations) between two consecutive trades are ran-
dom variables. If S(t) is the price of an asset at time t deﬁned according to the
previous tick interpolation procedure, S(t) = S(ti) where ti is the time instant
at which the last trade took place, then the price process can be considered
as a pure jump stochastic process in continuous time. In ﬁnance, it is better
to work with returns rather that prices. If S(0) is the price at time t = 0,
then the variable x(t) = log (S(t)/S(0)) is called the log-return or, better, the
log-price. This variable is analogous to the position of the walker in the physi-
cal interpretation. In the ﬁnancial intepretation the jump random variables ξi
are tick-by-tick log returns and they coincide with the diﬀerence between two
consecutive log prices, whereas the waiting times or durations τi denote the
elapsed time between two consecutive trades.

In general, jumps and waiting times are not independent from each other. In
any case, a CTRW is characterized by the joint probability density ϕ(ξ, τ ) of
jumps and waiting times; ϕ(ξ, τ ) dξ dτ is the probability of a jump to be in
the interval (ξ, ξ + dξ) and of a waiting time to be in the interval (τ, τ + dτ ).
The following integral equation gives the probability density, p(x, t), for the
walker being in position x at time t, conditioned on the fact that it was in
position x = 0 at time t = 0:

p(x, t) = δ(x) Ψ(t) +

where Ψ(τ ) is the so-called survival function. Ψ(τ ) is related to the marginal
waiting-time probability density ψ(τ ). The two marginal densities ψ(τ ) and
λ(ξ) are:

In order to obtain p(x, t), it is then necessary to invert its Laplace-Fourier
p(κ, s). Analytic solutions are quite important, as they provide a
transform
benchmark for testing numerical inversion methods. In the next section, an
explicit analytic solution for a class of continuous-time random walks with
anomalous relaxation behaviour will be presented. It will be necessary to re-
strict oneself to the uncoupled case, in which jumps and waiting-times are not
correlated.

2.2 The normal compound Poisson process

In this section, the solution of eq. (3) will be derived in the uncoupled case
where the joint probability density of jumps and durations can be factorized
in term of its marginals. After the derivation of a genearal formula for p(x, t),
this will be specialized to the case of the normal compound Poisson process
(NCPP).

If jump sizes do not depend on waiting times, the joint probability density for
jumps and waiting times can be written as follows:

ϕ(ξ, τ ) = λ(ξ)ψ(τ )

(11)

with the normalization conditions

dξλ(ξ) = 1 and

dτ ψ(τ ) = 1.

transforms of Fourier and Laplace, as it describes a jump process subordinated
to a renewal process.

A remarkable analytic solution is available when the waiting-time probability
density function has the following exponential form:

Then, the survival probability is Ψ(τ ) = e−µτ and the probability of n jumps
occurring up to time t is given by the Poisson distribution:

ψ(τ ) = µe−µτ .

P (n, t) =

However, the normal compound Poisson process is not able to reproduce the
following stylized facts on high frequency data:

(1) The empirical distribution of log-returns is leptokurtic, whereas the NCPP

assumes a mesokurtic (actually normal) distribution.

(2) The empirical distribution of durations is non-exponential with excess
standard deviation [21,22,8,11,12], whereas the NCPP assumes an expo-
nential distribution.

(3) The autocorrelation of absolute log-returns decays slowly [11], whereas

the NCPP assumes i.i.d. log-returns.

(4) Log-returns and waiting times are not independent [11,23], whereas the

(5) Volatility and activity vary during the trading day [24], whereas the

NCPP assumes their independence.

NCPP assumes they are constant.

3 Mixtures of normal compound Poisson processes

3.1 Deﬁnition

It is possible to overcome the above shortcomings by using a suitable mixture
of NCPPs. During a trading day, the volatility and the activity are higher at
the opening of the market, then they decrease at midday and they increase
again at market closure [24]. If the trading day can be divided into T intervals
T
of constant activity
i=1, then the waiting-time distribution is a mixture
of exponential distributions and its probability density can be written as:

{

ψ(τ ) =

aiµie−µiτ ,

T

Xi=1

(23)

{

ai}

T
i=1 is a set of suitable weights. The activity seasonality can be
where
mimicked by values of µi that decrease towards midday and then increase
again towards market closure. In order to reproduce the correlation between
volatility and activity, one can assume that:

σξ,i = cµi

(24)

where c is a suitable constant. Future work will be devoted to an analytical
study of this model as well as to further empirical investigations on model
validation. Below, the results of a simulation performed with the model are
presented, and the performance of the model with respect to the stylized facts
is discussed.

3.2 Results

{

µi}

A Monte Carlo simulation of the model described in the previous subsection
has been performed by considering a trading day divided into ten intervals of
10
i=1 = 1/10, 1/20, 1/30, 1/40, 1/50, 1/40, 1/30, 1/20,
constant activity with
1/15, 1/10 s−1. For each value of µi, 100 exponentially distributed waiting
times have extracted as well as 100 normally distributed log-returns with zero
µi. Therefore, there are 1000 values of waiting
average and σξ,i = 0.001
times and log returns in a trading day, representing a rather liquid share. The
opening price is set to 100 arbitrary units (a.u.). In Fig. 1, a sample path is
plotted for the price as a function of trading time. Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 represent
the tick-by-tick time series of log-returns and waiting times respectively. For
this particular simulation, the eﬀect of variable activity and volatility can be
detected by direct eye inspection.

distribution has fat tails, is leptokurtic and the kurtosis is equal to 6.

The empirical complementary cumulative distribution function for intertrade
durations is given in Fig. 5. The solid line is the single exponential ﬁt to the
simulated data. There is excess standard deviation: the standard deviation of
waiting times is 29 s, whereas the average waiting time is 25 s.

Fig. 6 shows the slow decay of the autocorrelation of absolute log-returns
related to volatility clustering, whereas signed log-returns are zero already at
the second lag.

In conclusion, the model based on mixtures of normal compound Poisson pro-
cesses incorporates variable daily activity, as well as the dependence between
durations and tick-by-tick log-returns via eq. (24). It is then able to replicate
the following stylized facts:

The empirical distribution of log-returns is leptokurtic;

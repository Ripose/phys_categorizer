The uniqueness of the proﬁts distribution function

in the middle scale region

∗Atushi Ishikawa
Kanazawa Gakuin University, Kanazawa 920-1392, Japan

Abstract

We report the proof that the expression of extended Gibrat’s law is unique and the
probability distribution function (pdf) is also uniquely derived from the law of detailed
balance and the extended Gibrat’s law. In the proof, two approximations are employed that
the pdf of growth rate is described as tent-shaped exponential functions and that the value
of the origin of growth rate is constant. These approximations are conﬁrmed in proﬁts data
of Japanese companies 2003 and 2004. The resultant proﬁts pdf ﬁts with the empirical data
with high accuracy. This guarantees the validity of the approximations.

Introduction

In the large scale region of income, proﬁts, assets, sales and etc (x), the cumulative probability
distribution function (pdf) P (> x) obeys a power-law for x which is larger than a certain
threshold x0:

P (> x) ∝ x

−µ

for

x > x0 .

This power-law and the exponent µ are called Pareto’s law and Pareto index, respectively [1].
The power-law distribution is well investigated by using various models in econophysics [2].

Recently, Fujiwara et al. [3] ﬁnd that Pareto’s law can be derived kinematically from the law
of detailed balance and Gibrat’s law [4] which are also observed in the large scale region x > x0.
In the proof, they assume no model and only use these two laws in empirical data.

The detailed balance is time-reversal symmetry (x1 ↔ x2):

∗e-mail address: ishikawa@kanazawa-gu.ac.jp

P12(x1, x2) = P12(x2, x1) .

Here x1 and x2 are two successive incomes, proﬁts, assets, sales, etc. and P12(x1, x2) is the joint
pdf. Gibrat’s law states that the conditional pdf of growth rate Q(R|x1) is independent of the
initial value x1:

Q(R|x1) = Q(R) .

Here growth rate R is deﬁned as the ratio R = x2/x1 and Q(R|x1) is deﬁned by using the pdf
P (x1) and the joint pdf P1R(x1, R) as Q(R|x1) = P1R(x1, R)/P (x1).

In Ref. [5], the kinematics is extended to dynamics by analyzing data on the assessed value
of land in Japan. In the non-equilibrium system we propose an extension of the detailed balance
(detailed quasi-balance) as follows

P12(x1, x2) = P12(

1/θ

x2
a (cid:19)

(cid:18)

, a x1

θ) .

From Gibrat’s law (3) and the detailed quasi-balance (4), we derive Pareto’s law with annually
varying Pareto index. The parameters θ, a are related to the change of Pareto index and the
relation is conﬁrmed in the empirical data nicely.

These ﬁndings are important for the progress of econophysics. Above derivations are, how-
ever, valid only in the large scale region where Gibrat’s law (3) holds. It is well known that
Pareto’s law is not observed below the threshold x0 [4, 6]. The reason is thought to be the
breakdown of Gibrat’s law [3]. The breakdown of Gibrat’s law in empirical data is reported by
Stanley’s group [7]. Takayasu et al. [8] and Aoyama et al. [9] also report that Gibrat’s law does
not hold in the middle scale region by using data of Japanese companies.

In Ref. [10], Gibrat’s law is extended in the middle scale region by employing proﬁts data
of Japanese companies in 2002 and 2003. We approximate the conditional pdf of proﬁts growth
rate as so-called tent-shaped exponential functions

Q(R|x1) = d(x1) R
Q(R|x1) = d(x1) R+t−(x1)−1

−t+(x1)−1

for R > 1 ,

for R < 1 .

By measuring t± we have assumed the x1 dependence to be

t±(x1) = t±(x0) ± α± ln

x1
x0

,

and have estimated the parameters as [11]

α+ ∼ α− ∼ 0

for x1 > x0 ,

α+ ∼ α− 6= 0

for xmin < x1 < x0 ,

t+(x0) − t−(x0) ∼ µ .

From the detailed balance (2) and extended Gibrat’s law (7) – (10), we have derived the pdf in
the large and middle scale region uniformly as follows

P (x) = Cx

−(µ+1) e

−α ln2 x
x0

for x > xmin ,

(11)

where α = (α+ + α−) /2. This is conﬁrmed in the empirical data.

In this study, we prove that the x1 dependence of t± (7) with α+ = α− is unique if the
pdf of growth rate is approximated by tent-shaped exponential functions (5), (6). This means,
consequently, that the pdf in the large and middle scale region (11) is also unique if the x1
dependence of d(x1) is negligible. We conﬁrm these approximations in proﬁts data of Japanese
companies 2003 and 2004 [12] and show that the pdf (11) ﬁts with empirical data nicely by the
reﬁned data analysis.

2 Growth rate distributions of proﬁts in the database

In the database, Pareto’s law (1) is observed in the large scale region whereas it fails in the
middle one (Fig. 1). At the same time, it is conﬁrmed that the detailed balance (2) holds not
only in the large scale region x1 > x0 and x2 > x0 but also in all regions x1 > 0 and x2 > 0
(Fig. 2). 1

The breakdown of Pareto’s law is thought to be caused by the breakdown of Gibrat’s
law in the middle scale region. We examine, therefore, the pdf of proﬁts growth rate in
In the analysis, we divide the range of x1 into logarithmically equal bins as
the database.
x1 ∈ 4 × [101+0.2(n−1), 101+0.2n] thousand yen with n = 1, 2, · · · , 20. In Fig. 3 – 6, the probability
densities for r are expressed in the case of n = 1, · · · , 5, n = 6, · · · , 10, n = 11, · · · , 15 and
n = 16, · · · , 20, respectively. The number of the companies in Fig. 3 – 6 is “22, 005”, “89, 507”,
“85, 020” and “24, 203”, respectively. Here we use the log proﬁts growth rate r = log10 R. The
probability density for r deﬁned by q(r|x1) is related to that for R by

log10 Q(R|x1) + r + log10(ln 10) = log10 q(r|x1) .

From Fig. 3 – 6, log10 q(r|x1) is approximated by linear functions of r as follows

log10 q(r|x1) = c(x1) − t+(x1) r

for r > 0 ,

log10 q(r|x1) = c(x1) + t−(x1) r

for r < 0 .

These are expressed as tent-shaped exponential functions (5), (6) by d(x1) = 10c(x1)/ln 10 . In
addition, the x1 dependence of c(x1) (d(x1)) is negligible for n = 6, · · · , 20. The validity of these
approximations should be checked against the results.

3 The uniqueness of extended Gibrat’s law

In this section, we show that the x1 dependence of t± (7) is unique under approximations

(5), (6) ((13), (14)).

Due to the relation of P12(x1, x2)dx1dx2 = P1R(x1, R)dx1dR under the change of variables
from (x1, x2) to (x1, R), these two joint pdfs are related to each other P1R(x1, R) = x1P12(x1, x2).
1The scatter plot in Fig. 2 is diﬀerent from one in Ref [10]. The reason is that the identiﬁcation of proﬁts in
2002 and 2003 in Ref. [10] was partly failed. As a result, the pdfs of proﬁts growth rate are slightly diﬀerent from
those in this paper. The conclusion in Ref. [10] is, however, not changed.

By the use of this relation, the detailed balance (2) is rewritten in terms of P1R(x1, R) as follows:

Substituting the joint pdf P1R(x1, R) for the conditional probability Q(R|x1), the detailed bal-
ance is expressed as

P1R(x1, R) = R

−1P1R(x2, R

Under approximations (5) and (6), the detailed balance is reduced to

for R > 1. By using the notation ˜P (x) ≡ P (x)d(x), the detailed balance becomes

By expanding Eq. (18) around R = 1, the following diﬀerential equation is obtained

where x denotes x1. The same diﬀerential equation is obtained for R < 1. The solution is given
by

˜P (x) = Cx

−1 e

−G(x) ,

where t+(x) − t−(x) ≡ g(x) and

g(x)/x dx ≡ G(x).

In order to make the solution (20) around R = 1 satisﬁes Eq. (18), the following equation

R

must be valid for all R:

−G(x) + G(R x) =

t+(x) − t−(R x)

To make these solutions satisfy Eq. (21), the coeﬃcients must be C−2 = 0 and C+1 = 0. Finally
we conclude that t±(x) is uniquely expressed as Eq. (7) with α+ = α−.

4 The proﬁts distribution and the data ﬁtting

Under approximations (5) and (6) ((13) and (14)), we obtain the proﬁts pdf

˜P (x) = P (x)d(x) = Cx

−(µ+1) e

−α ln2 x

x0 ,

(27)

where we use the relation (10) conﬁrmed in Ref. [11].

In Fig. 7, t± hardly responds to x1 for n = 17, · · · , 20. This means that Gibrat’s law holds
in the large proﬁts region. On the other hand, t+ linearly increases and t− linearly decreases
symmetrically with log10 x1 for n = 9, 10, · · · , 13. The parameters are estimated as Eq. (8) and
(9) with α (= α+ = α−) ∼ 0.14 and x0 = 4 × 101+0.2(17−1) ∼ 63, 000 thousand yen. Because the
x1 dependence of c(x1) (d(x1)) is negligible in this region, the proﬁts pdf is reduced to Eq. (11).
We observe that this pdf ﬁts with the empirical data nicely in Fig. 8.

Notice that the estimation of α in Fig. 7 is signiﬁcant. If we take a slightly diﬀerent α, the

pdf (11) cannot ﬁt with the empirical data (α = 0.10 or α = 0.20 in Fig. 8 for instance).

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we have shown the proof that the expression of extended Gibrat’s law is unique
and the pdf in the large and middle scale region is also uniquely derived from the law of detailed
balance and the extended Gibrat’s law. In the proof, we have employed two approximations that
the pdf of growth rate is described as tent-shaped exponential functions and that the value of
the origin of growth rate is constant. These approximations have been conﬁrmed in proﬁts data
of Japanese companies 2003 and 2004. The resultant pdf of proﬁts has ﬁtted with the empirical
data with high accuracy. This guarantees the validity of the approximations.

For proﬁts data we have used, the distribution is power in the large scale region and log-
normal type in the middle one. This does not claim that all the distributions in the middle
scale region are log-normal types. For instance, the pdf of personal income growth rate or sales
of company is diﬀerent from tent-shaped exponential functions [3]. In this case, the extended
Gibrat’s law takes a diﬀerent form. In addition, we describe no pdf in the small scale region [13].
Because the x1 dependence of d(x1) in this region is not negligible (Fig. 3).

Against these restrictions, the proof and the method in this paper is signiﬁcant for the
investigation of distributions in the middle and small scale region. We will report the study
about these issues in the near future.

Figure 8: The probability distribution function (pdf) P (x2) for companies, the proﬁts of which
in 2003 (x1) and 2004 (x2) exceeded 0, x1 > 0 and x2 > 0. The pdf derived from the detailed
Indices µ, α and x0
balance and the extended Gibrat’s law ﬁts with the data accurately.
are already estimated in the extended Gibrat’s law. If the parameters are diﬀerent from the
estimation, the pdf cannot ﬁt with the data (α = 0.10 or α = 0.20 for instance).

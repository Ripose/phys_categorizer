1 Introduction

Despite the fact that the Verhulst’s idea [1] of regulated biological populations
is 200 years old, it is still very useful since it allows to investigate features of
various systems. Here an eight order logistic map is applied in modelling the
inﬂuence of information ﬂow delay onto the behaviour of an economic system.
The delay of information ﬂow is an internal feature of all economic systems,
because continuous monitoring of such systems both on macro and microecon-
omy scales is either extremely diﬃcult or even impossible. The more so since
the data is not easily available nor even reliable as it could be in physics
laboratories. Macroeconomy parameters such as Gross Domestic Product,
Gross National Product, inﬂation, demographic data etc. are announced in
well deﬁned time intervals (monthly, quarterly or annually). The same situa-
tion is observed in the case of various companies. They announce their ﬁnan-
cial statements about their economic results at speciﬁc dates and for given
time intervals – according to internal or external rules (usually according to
law regulations). Sometimes some ”warning” is issued. However the tendency
is that intervals between announcements are rather long, e.g. the value of a
dividend is announced annually or at various trimester ends. It seems obvious
that only very small companies are able to perform continuous monitoring.
But even then, the process of collecting information from a signiﬁcant (on a
macroscopic scale) number of such companies inhibits or makes it impossible
to perform continuous monitoring. In view of the data collecting procedure it
is clear that every economic decision is based on some information describing
a past situation. It is also important to notice that the time delays between in-
formation gathering, decision taking, policy implementation, and subsequent
data gathering are not regularly spaced, nor is a fortiori a continuous vari-
able, as that was considered in [2]; indeed the information about the system
is updated at the end of discrete time intervals.

2

J. Mi´skiewicz and M. Ausloos

Therefore econophysics-like modelling of such features encounters some
diﬃculty, surely at the testing level. Recently a microscopic-like approach has
been presented, through a model [3, 4, 5] including some measure of a company
ﬁtness with respect to an external ﬁeld, and a birth-death evolution, according
to some business plan, and the local company close range environment. The
information ﬂow was however considered to occur instantaneously.

In order to investigate the discrete information ﬂow time delay and its
eﬀect, a model, hereby called the ACP model [3, 4, 5], has been modiﬁed
by splitting the information about the system into two parameters. One is
monitored continuously (is updated at every iteration step) and is known
to the system itself; the second, – like oﬃcial statements of the system, is
announced at the end of discrete time intervals and is used by companies for
calculating their strategies. Therefore the strategy of a company depends on
the delay time information and the information itself. As it is shown in Sect.
3 the length of the time delay (td) inﬂuences quite strongly and in a nontrivial
way the behaviour of the overall system.

Detailed description of the ACP model is given in Sect. 2 and the prop-
erties of the system as a function of time delay and initial concentration are
investigated (Sect. 3) in the case of short, medium and long time delays.

2 ACP model

For the sake of clarity the basic ingredients of the ACP model are recalled
here below. The main problem was to simulate the behaviour of economic
systems in spatio-temporally changing environmental conditions, e. g. political
changes and destruction of economy barriers. The model was set in the form
of a Monte Carlo simulation. Notice that the ACP model [3, 4, 5] contains
among its variants an adaptation of the Bak – Sneppen model and was built
in order to answer economy questions3. The model consists of

1. space – a square symmetry lattice,
2. companies, which are initially randomly placed on the lattice, in an
3. environment characterised by a real ﬁeld F ∈ [0, 1] and a selection

4. each company (i) is characterised by one real parameter fi ∈ [0, 1] (so

pressure sel,

called its ﬁtness).

The following set of actions was allowed to companies:

1. companies survive with the probability

pi = exp(−sel|fi − F |)

(1)

3Let us recall that the Bak- Sneppen model was originally built in order to

investigate the coevolution of populations [6]

Inﬂuence of information ﬂow in the formation of economic cycles

2. companies may move on the lattice horizontally or vertically, one step at
a time, if some space is available in the von Neuman neighbourhood.

3. if companies meet they may

a) either merge with a probability b,
b) or create a new company with the probability 1 − b.

The ACP model may be described in a mean ﬁeld approximation [7, 8] by
introducing the distribution function of companies N (t, f ), which describes
the number of companies having a given ﬁtness f at time t. The system is
then additionally characterised by the concentration of companies c(t).

The present report of our investigations is restricted to the case of the best
adapted companies (f = F ), so that the selection pressure has no inﬂuence on
the survival of companies. So the only factor which could alter the number of
companies is the strategy, i.e. the decision to merge or create a new entity. The
ideas behind the mean ﬁeld approximation [7, 8] is applied here and developed
by introducing a strategy depending on the system state and the discrete time
of the oﬃcial announcement about the state of the system.

The introduction of the strategy depending on the state of the system
reﬂects the idea of Verhulst [1], when replacing the constant Malthus grow
rate by the function 1 − x, which introduced a limit for the system to grow.
In the present investigation it is assumed that the strategy should depend
on the state of the system. Moreover the company board takes its decision
knowing informations announced about its environment. The generation of
new entities is more likely in the case of a low concentration of companies
than when this concentration is high. The merging parameter describes the
reversed dependency, i.e. merging is more likely to occur in the case of a high
density of companies than if the density is low. The simplest function which
fulﬁls this condition is 1 − c, the same as in Verhulst original work [1].

The additional ingredients to the ACP model are thus

1. the merging parameter b is replaced by a strategy (1 − c),
2. the companies know the value of the concentration c according to oﬃcial

statements announced after the time delay td.

The evolution equation of the system with companies, using the state depen-
dent strategy is:

1
2

ct = ct−1 +

ct−1(1 − c8

t−1)(1 − (1 − ct−1)8)(2ST (c(g(t))) − 1),

(2)

where ST (c) = 1 − c, g(t) = k[ t
k ] and [ ] denotes the procedure of taking a
natural number not larger than the one given in the brackets. The time is
measured in iteration steps IS.

3 Results

Numerical methods were used in order to investigate properties of the system.
Because the coevolution equation (2) is given as an iteration equation the time

4

is discrete and counted in iteration steps (IS). The following features of the
system were examined:

1. the coevolution of c(t) as a function of the initial concentration,
2. the stability time deﬁned as the time required to achieve a unique stable
solution; because of numerical reasons the criterium applied here is |cn+1−
cn| < 10−10,

3. the crash time – tc, such that ctc < 0 (it is understood as a time when

all companies are wiped out from the system),

4. the stability intervals – the intervals of initial values for which the

evolution of the system is longer than a given time ts

5. the complex Lyapunov exponent

The Lyapunov exponent calculated in its complex form (3) gives also some
information about the oscillations of the system. Using the properties of log-
arithm:

The numerical iterations were performed for the initial concentration in
the interval c0 ∈ (0, 1), at consecutive values distant of 0.02. Therefore 500
histories of evolution were investigated.

There are possible to observe three types of coevolution – a unique, a
periodic and a chaotic solution. In the case of unique solution the system
may approach this solution in the form ”damped” coevolution or ”damped
oscillation”. The damped coevolution is if ∀t > 0 c(∞) − c(t) > 0 or ∀t >
0 c(∞) − c(t) < 0 and |c(t − 1) − c(t)| ≥ |c(t) − c(t + 1)|, where c(∞) is
the asymptotic state of the system. This means that the distance between
concentration and asymptotic concentration is decreasing in every iteration
step and either the concentration is smaller or bigger than the asymptotic
concentration. The damped oscillations are observed if |c(t − 1) − c(t)| ≥
|c(t) − c(t + 1)| and ∃t0 such that ∀t > t0 c(t) > c(∞) and c(t + 1) < c(∞),
this means the distance between consecutive concentrations of companies is
decreasing. In the case of a periodic solution for t > t0 there exists a n-tuple
of concentrations which is repeated for t > t0, where t0 is the time required by
the system to reach the stable or periodic solution. The length of the n-tuple
is deﬁned as the period of oscillations. The system is chaotic if the real part
of the Lyapunov exponent Re(λ) > 0.

The coevolution of the system is presented either as a function of time
(Fig. 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 15, where the coevolution is plotted for chosen initial
concentrations) or as a function of initial concentration (Fig. 2, 5, 8, 11, 14,
16, where the coevolution of the system is plotted in one vertical line so the
plot is a set of coevolutions for 500 diﬀerent initial concentrations.

3.1 Stability window

The short time delay (td) is deﬁned as a 2 IS ≤ td ≤ 4 IS). In this case the
system evolves to the unique stable solution c = 0.5. Within this time delay
the Lyapunov exponent is equal to zero; no chaotic behaviour is seen.

td = 2 IS

The time delay td = 2 IS means that the information about the system is
updated every two iteration steps. The evolution of the system is presented
in Fig. 2 and is plotted as a function of initial iteration. For every 500 initial
concentrations 103 iteration steps have been used. The history examples are
presented in Fig. 1 as a function of concentration in time. In the case of the
shortest time delay considered here the system has a unique solution c = 0.5.
The stability time as a function of initial concentration is shown in Fig. 3.
For a very low initial concentration 0 < c0 . 0.01 a long time (ts ≥ 47 IS) is
needed in order to achieve the stable state. It is also illustrated in Fig. 1, where
in the case of low initial concentrations c0 = 0.002 the stability time is quite
long time (about 100 IS). However except for very small initial concentrations
(c0 > 0.1) the stability time is short ts ∈ (10 IS, 20 IS).

td = 3 IS

Extending the time delay by one, up to three iteration steps, induces impor-
tant changes in the system. In the evolution of the system, damped oscillations
become observable, e.g. for c0 = 0.002 damped oscillations are observed for
t ∈ (140 IS, 155 IS) (Fig. 5 and Fig. 4). The maximum time required for the
system to achieve a stable state extends to ts ≥ 220 IS as compared with
ts ≥ 47 IS for td = 2IS. For most initial concentrations ( c0 > 0.05) the
stability time is in the interval ts ∈ (70 IS, 100 IS). Therefore the system
requires a longer time to achieve a stable state. However there are some ”sta-
bility points” for which the system achieves a stable state markedly faster.
These can be found on Fig. 6; these points are: c0 = 0.074, ts = 76 IS;
c0 = 0.136, ts = 73 IS; c0 = 0.284, ts = 61 IS; c0 = 0.5, ts = 1 IS;
c0 = 0.826, ts = 58 IS; c0 = 0.952, ts = 67 IS.

Comparing the results obtained in the case of td = 2IS and td = 3IS it can
be noticed that the stability times is signiﬁcantly extended and new features
become visible (damped oscillations). Therefore we can conclude that the
system is very sensitive to the ﬂow of information and extension by only one IS
step of the time delay changes the behaviour of the system quite signiﬁcantly.

td = 4 IS

For a time delay td = 4 IS, the lately seen features (damped oscillations) are
also present as it can be observed on both ﬁgures showing the coevolution
for the considered initial concentrations and for chosen histories presenting
explicitly time evolution of the system – Fig.5 and Fig.8 respectively. It is
worth noticing that the damping of oscillations is much weaker than in the
case td = 4 (compare Fig.5 and Fig.8). The oscillation amplitude is decreasing
signiﬁcantly more slowly for the case td = 4 IS than for td = 3 IS. However in
all considered cases td = 2 IS, td = 3 IS, td = 4 IS, the system has one stable
solution, but the stability time depends on the delay time; it is the longest
in the case td = 4 IS (3200 IS ≤ ts ≤ 4200 IS). The time required for the
system to achieve stable state is presented in Fig. 9. As in the previous case
td = 3 IS there are initial concentrations for which the system reaches the
stable state signiﬁcantly quicker, e.g. c0 = 0.23.

3.2 Medium time delay

td = 5 IS and td = 6 IS

The ﬁve iteration step delay time (td = 5 IS) is very interesting, because this
is the shortest time for which cycles of concentration can be observed. For

this time delay the system has several solutions. Despite the fact that the real
part of the Lyapunov exponent is still equal to zero, its imaginary part is not.
According to Eq. (4) this shows that the system has a periodic solution. These
solutions can be seen in Fig. 11 and Fig. 10. In the case of Fig. 11 the evolution
is shown as a function of its initial concentration, whereas Fig. 10 presents
the system evolution as a function of time for chosen initial concentrations.

Oscillating solutions can be also found in the case td = 6 IS; the imaginary
part of the Lyapunov exponent, as in the previous case (td = 5 IS) is negative
(Fig. 12).

3.3 Long time delay

td ≥ 7 IS

Extending the delay time above six iteration steps leads to a possible collapse
of the system. For td ≥ 7 IS the system may crash. The crash is deﬁned when
the concentration of companies becomes negative or zero. Examples of such
evolutions which lead to a crash are presented in the case of td = 12IS and
td = 15IS on Fig. 14 and Fig. 16 respectively. The crash of the system is
presented in such plots as a white band containing very few points in the

the initial concentration axis, e.g. td ∈ (0.15; 0.2) ∪ (0.34; 0.36) ∪ (0.53; 0.61)
the crash of the system occurs very quickly. However there are some initial
concentrations for which the evolution of the system before crash time is
quite long (up to 400 IS). Additionally in the case of td = 15, the system
may evolve toward a stable state, with a full occupation of the environment
by companies. Examples of such an evolution as a function of time for given
initial concentrations are presented in Fig. 13 and Fig. 15 for the cases td = 12
and td = 15 respectively.

4 Conclusions

Economic cycle causes and occurrences are fascinating and relevant subjects
of interest in many economy questions [9]-[10]. The problem has been studied
also by means of sociology technics [11], showing that changes of opinions
about recession or prosperity undergo drastic changes from one equilibrium
to another, both having ﬂuctuations in stochastically resonant systems. In
the present investigation, an information ﬂow, typical of economy systems,
has been incorporated into the ACP model [3, 4, 5]. ‘This has led to observe

diﬀerent forms of so called cycles, through concentration oscillations. In the
case of short delay time td ∈ (2 IS, 4 IS), between data acquisition and pol-
icy implementation by a company, the system evolves toward a unique stable
equilibrium state. This situation can be highly welcomed in some economy
systems. Indeed this indicates that, through an information control, a system
can insure the existence of a high number of companies, whence not threat-
ening the system of a collapse.

In the case of medium size delay times td = 5 IS or td = 6 IS, the system
undergoes oscillations: stable concentration cycles appear in the system. This
form of evolution is often observed in economy, e.g. agricultural markets, where
without external control the level of agricultural production oscillates between
over- and underproduction. Since the enlarging of the delay time leads to the
possibility of the system to crash, such a system may require some external
(governmental) control, for its stability. In reality, the delay of information ﬂow
and policy implementation may also ﬂuctuate. For long information ﬂow delay
times, td ≥ 7 , the systems may crash for most initial concentrations. However,
despite the frequent possibility of the system to crash the situation is not
hopeless because the crash time in many cases is long enough to allow for some
particular control and to avoid the collapse of the company concentration. It
is also possible to observe a ”economy resonance” where despite a long delay
time the system evolves for a long time or can even reach a stable state, which
insures its existence. This latest observation is especially interesting for market
control purposes, because it points to the existence of initial conditions for
which the system may evolve during a very long time, which is vital for the
possibility of creating and applying some control procedures.

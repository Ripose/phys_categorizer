Abstract

We investigate an economic system in which one large agent - the Japan government changes the

environment of numerous smaller agents - the Japan agriculture producers by indirect regulation

of prices of agriculture goods. The reason for this intervention was that before the oil crisis in 1974

Japan agriculture production prices exhibited irregular and large amplitude changes. By means of

analysis of correlations and a combination of singular spectrum analysis (SSA), principal component

analysis (PCA), and time delay phase space construction (TDPSC) we study the inﬂuence of the

government measures on the domestic piglet prices and production in Japan. We show that the

government regulation politics was successful and leaded (i) to a decrease of the nonstationarities

and to increase of predictability of the piglet price; (ii) to a coupling of the price and production

cycles; (iii) to increase of determinism of the dynamics of the ﬂuctuations of piglet price around

the year average price. The investigated case is an example conﬁrming the thesis that a large

agent can change in a signiﬁcant way the environment of the small agents in complex (economic

or ﬁnancial) systems which can be crucial for their survival or extinction.

I. MARKET COMPLEXITY AND GOVERNMENT REGULATION

The growing complexity of the human society increases the diﬃculties in ensuring its

steady economic development. This leads to increasing importance of large social agents such

as state central bank or the national government which can inﬂuence in a signiﬁcant way the

ﬁnancial and economic subsystems of the society. Changes of the interest rates, intervention

on the exchange markets and subsidies for selected economic branches improve or worsen the

environment for the small size economics and social agents. Below we discuss an especially

critical issue for the sustainable development of the society namely the development of the

large network of economic, ecological and social components called national agricultural

system. A sudden decrease of the agriculture production can lead to social tensions. The

requirement for steady increase of the food quality and quantity presses entire branches

of the agriculture system to move from the natural (due to the climate) regimes of cyclic

output to more uncontrollable regimes of chaotic output. Because of the above two reasons

the governments try to regulate the market for agriculture goods especially after large crises

such as wars or oil shocks [? ? ? ]. Here we shall analyze the results of a such intervention

by the methods of the time series analysis (see [? ] and for applications [? ? ? ]). Together

with the methods of the nonlinear dynamics and stochastic analysis the above-mentioned

methods are much applied for understanding, description and evaluation of the dynamics of

complex economic and social systems [? ? ? ? ] and in particular in studies of diﬀerent

aspects of the agriculture production such as analysis of the dairy production in the USA

[? ] or the analysis of the meat production in Japan [? ].

With its about 130 million citizens and highly developed economy Japan is a large con-

sumer of meat but up to about 45 years ago no specialized in piglet production farms existed.

As the consumption increased in the 1960’s this production became lucrative source of money

for the farmers and specialized farms for production of piglets and meat arose. Until 1974

there was no massive intervention of the Japanese government on the agriculture market,

i.e., less than 1/10 from the farmers received subsides from the state. After the oil crisis

from 1974 the situation changed signiﬁcantly and almost all agricultural producers have been

included in the subsidies schemes and other farm programs intending to ﬁx the instability

of the agriculture markets.

II. WAS THE JAPAN GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION SUCCESSFUL?

In order to investigate the consequences of the actions of the large agents often we do not

need to analyze the large amount of data normally required by econophysicsists for analysis

of systems containing many almost identical small-size agents. Here we study monthly time

series for the piglet production and prices in Japan from 1965 to 1992 (i.e. before the

recession events in the last decade of previous century). The time series are too short and

too nonstationary in order to be investigated by means of the conventional methods of the

nonlinear time series analysis such as Lyapunov exponents or generalized dimensions but we

can apply another methodology based on singular spectrum analysis (SSA) and principal

component analysis (PCA) (see for example [? ? ? ? ? ]). The time series are shown

in Fig.1. The oil crisis from 1974 is located just before the maximum of the price time

series.

In the period before the crisis the price time series are very nonstationary with

a sharp upward trend. The government intervention after the crisis stabilized the price

and the seasonal periodicity became more important in comparison to the period before

the oil crisis. Such drastic changes are not observed in the time series for the production

which shows a trend of increase up to the beginning of 1990s. The autocorrelation function

supplies us with additional information. For an example if the time series are correlated and

not periodic the autocorrelation function decays slower than exponentially and in presence

of long-range correlations we can observe a power-law decay (for more details see for an

example [? ? ? ? ? ]). The autocorrelation functions for the production and prices

of the piglets in Japan are shown in Figs. 2 and 3.

In Fig. 2 we observe slower decay

of the autocorrelation function A(n) of the production time series after the oil crisis when

compared to the pre-crisis function. Thus after the government intervention the piglets

5

production became more correlated in the time, e.g., more predictable. The government

intervention has not inﬂuenced signiﬁcantly the (caused by the speciﬁcs of the consumers

demand) 6- and 12-months production cycles. Completely diﬀerent is the situation about

the piglet prices. Before the crisis the price correlations decay with increasing n. After the

government intervention the strong upward trend is not presented anymore. The dominant

process is a 12-months cycle and the minima and maxima of A(n) follow each other in a

6-months tact. Thus the intervention coupled the price and production cycles and the prices

became much more predictable.

In combination with the method of delay vector construction [? ? ] the singular spectrum

analysis can deal successfully with short and nonstationary time series [? ? ? ? ? ]. Let
us have a time series consisting of N ∗ values x(τ0), x(2τ0), . . . , x(N ∗τ ) recorded by using

ﬁxed time step τ0. On the basis of the time series we construct m−dimensional vectors
as follows. First we choose the step τ = nτ0 and then we construct the vectors ~Xi =

{x(iτ0), x(iτ0 +τ ), . . . , x(iτ0 +(m−1)τ )}. In such a way by means of the TDPSC (time delay

phase space construction) we transform the time series to a set of vectors. We note that the

requirements for TDPSC are diﬀerent from the requirements for the time-delay embedding.

In TDPSC we have to choose n as small as possible and m must be as large as possible

(here n = 1, m = 30). By means of the TDPSC vectors we build the trajectory matrix

N ]T as well as the covariance matrix of the trajectory K = XT X.
Let ~kp be the eigenvectors of the last matrix and σp are the eigenvalues corresponding to
these vectors. The vectors ~kp form an orthonormal basis in the m− dimensional space
of the vectors ~Xi. The matrix X can be decomposed in the following way: X = SΣCT

where S is an N × m matrix consisting of the eigenvectors of the trajectory matrix [? ].
C = [~k1, ~k2, . . . , ~km] is the m × m orthogonal matrix and Σ = diag[σ1, σ2, . . . , σm] is the

diagonal matrix constructed by the eigenvalues σi called also singular values. These values

are nonnegative and the common rule is to number them with respect to their values as

follows: σ1 ≥ σ2 ≥ · · · ≥ σm ≥ 0. In addition we can decompose the time series {xi} using
the eigenvectors ~kq of the Toeplitz matrix of the time series xi+j = Pm

year trend is subtracted. What remains are the oscillations around the trend and we shall

investigate if the the dimension of the phase space dynamics of these oscillations decreased

as a result of the discussed Japan government intervention. Strong evidence for such a

conclusion is obtained by comparing the singular spectra of the the time series as well as the

part of total variance of time series contained in the corresponding principal components.

7

These two quantities for the detrended time series before and after the crisis are shown in

Figs. 4 and 5. The largest singular values in the singular spectra shown in Fig. 4 are

connected to the deterministic part of the time series and the number of the signiﬁcant

components in the singular spectrum (which values are signiﬁcantly larger than the other

singular values) gives us the value of the statistical dimension S which is an upper bound of

signiﬁcant degrees of freedom of the investigated system. The concentration of ﬂuctuation

dynamics can be observed in Fig.4 where we can see the increase of the signiﬁcance of the

ﬁrst two principal components after the crisis at the expense of the signiﬁcance of the second

two principal components. Additional light on the concentration of the dynamics is given

by Fig. 5 where we observe increasing of the percentage of total variance of time series

concentrated in the ﬁrst two principal components after the crisis. We can conclude that

the dynamics of the ﬂuctuations is (a) low -dimensional even before the crisis and (b) its

dimensionality decreases further after the crisis and the essential part of the dynamics can

be captured by an appropriate model containing small number of equations. In order to test

the last assumption we plot in Fig. 6 the full detrended time series after the crisis (panel (a))

as well as the time series projected in the subspace of ﬁrst two principal components (panel

(b)) or on the ﬁrst ﬁve principal components (panel (c)). As we can see essential features

of the dynamics such as its periodicity are captured already in two-dimensional phase space

whereas the details of the dynamics of the ﬂuctuation can be very well described when the

S = 5. On the basis of this conclusion in future we shall try to model the ﬂuctuation price

dynamics by means of a low-dimensional nonlinear dynamics model.

As concluding remark we note that in this paper we concentrated our attention on a

problem not much investigated up to now by the econophysics which is focused much more

on the statistical properties of economic and ﬁnancial systems containing many similar-

(small) size interacting agents. Here we show that the presence of a large agent(s) in such

systems can lead to signiﬁcant changes of the environment of action and interaction of the

smaller agents. We have shown that as a result of the Japan government intervention on

the agriculture markets after the oil crisis in 1974 (i) the large pre-crisis nonstationarity of

the piglet prices was reduced; (ii) the price behavior became cyclic and was coupled to the

consumer-driven production cycle and (iii) In addition the dimension of the phase space

of the dynamics of price ﬂuctuations around the yearly moving average became smaller

as a result of the intervention. The government intervention has made the prices more

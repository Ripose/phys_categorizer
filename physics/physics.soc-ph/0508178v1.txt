Derivation of the distribution from extended Gibrat’s law

Abstract

Employing proﬁts data of Japanese companies in 2002 and 2003, we identify the non-
Gibrat’s law which holds in the middle proﬁts region. From the law of detailed balance in all
regions, Gibrat’s law in the high region and the non-Gibrat’s law in the middle region, we
kinematically derive the proﬁts distribution function in the high and middle range uniformly.
The distribution function accurately ﬁts with empirical data without any ﬁtting parameter.

Introduction

The distribution of wealth, income or company size is one of important issues not only in
economics but also in econophysics [1]. In these distributions, a cumulative number N (> x)
obeys a power-law for x which is larger than a certain threshold x0:

N (> x)

µ

x−

∝

for

x > x0 .

(1)

This power-law and the exponent µ are called Pareto’s law and Pareto index, respectively [2] 1.
Here x is wealth, income, proﬁts, assets, sales, the number of employees and etc.

The study of power-law distributions in the high range is quite signiﬁcant. Because a large
part of the total wealth, income or proﬁts is occupied by persons or companies in the high region,
although the number of them is a few percent. They have the possibility to inﬂuence economics.
Power-law distributions are observed in fractal systems which have self-similarity. This means
that there is self-similarity in economic systems. The power-law distribution in the high region
is well investigated by using various models in econophysics.

Recently, Fujiwara et al.

[5] ﬁnd that Pareto’s law (and the reﬂection law) can be derived
kinematically form the law of detailed balance and Gibrat’s law [6] which are observed in high

region x > x0. In the proof, they assume no model and only use these two underlying laws in
empirical data.

The detailed balance is time-reversal symmetry:

Here x1 and x2 are two successive incomes, proﬁts, assets, sales, etc, and P12(x1, x2) is a joint
probability distribution function (pdf). Gibrat’s law states that the conditional probability
distribution of growth rate Q(R

x1) is independent of the initial value x1:
|

Here growth rate R is deﬁned as the ratio R = x2/x1 and Q(R
P (x1) and the joint pdf P1R(x1, R) as

x1) is deﬁned by using the pdf

P12(x1, x2) = P12(x2, x1) .

|

Q(R

.

In Ref.

[7], by using proﬁts data of Japanese companies in 2002 (x1) and 2003 (x2), it is
conﬁrmed that the law of detailed balance (2) holds in all regions x1 > 0 and x2 > 0 (Fig. 1).
We also ﬁnd that Gibrat’s law still holds in the extended region x1 > x0 and x2 > 0. From these
observations, we have shown that Pareto index is also induced from the growth rate distribution
empirically.

On the other hand, it is also well known that the power-law is not observed below the
threshold x0 [6, 8]. For instance, we show the proﬁts distributions of Japanese companies in
2002 and 2003 (Fig. 2). We ﬁnd that Pareto’s law holds in the high proﬁts region and it fails
in the middle one. The study of distributions in the middle region is as important as the study
of power-law those. Because a large number of persons or companies is included in the middle
region. Furthermore, it is interesting to study the breaking of fractal.

In order to obtain the distribution in the middle region, we examine data below the threshold
x0. It is reported that Gibrat’s law is valid only in the high region ([9] for instance). The recent
works about the breakdown of Gibrat’s law is done by Stanley’s group [10]. Aoyama et al. also
report that Gibrat’s law does not hold in the middle region by using data of Japanese companies
[11].

In the analysis of Gibrat’s law in Ref. [7], we concentrate our attention to the region x1 > x0
and x2 > 0. In this paper, we examine the growth rate distribution in all regions x1 > 0 and
x2 > 0 and identify the law which is the extension of Gibrat’s law 2. We employ proﬁts data of
Japanese companies in 2002 and 2003 which are available on the database “CD Eyes” published
by Tokyo Shoko Research, Ltd. [12].

By using the extended Gibrat’s law, we derive the distribution function in the high and
middle proﬁts region under the law of detailed balance. It explains empirical data with high
accuracy. Notice that the distribution function has no ﬁtting parameter. The parameters of the
function are already decided in the extended Gibrat’s law.

2In this paper, we call the law in the region x1 < x0 and x2 > 0 non-Gibrat’s law.

3 Proﬁts distribution in the high and middle region

In Refs. [7], Pareto’s law (1) and the Pareto index µ can be derived from the detailed balance
(2) and Gibrat’s law (3) in the high proﬁts region. In this section, we derive proﬁts distribution
not only in the high proﬁts region but also in the middle one by using the detailed balance and
the extended Gibrat’s law.

Due to the relation of P12(x1, x2)dx1dx2 = P1R(x1, R)dx1dR under the change of variables

from (x1, x2) to (x1, R), these two joint pdfs are related to each other,

4 Data ﬁtting

In the previous section, we derive the proﬁts distribution function (22) in the high and
middle proﬁts region from the detailed balance and the extended Gibrat’s law. In this section,
we directly examine whether it ﬁts with proﬁts distribution data.

In order to average the scattering of data points, we employ the cumulative number of
companies (Fig. 2). For x1 > x0, by using Eqs. (12) and (22) the cumulative distribution in the
high proﬁts region is expressed as

In Fig. 7, the distribution functions (24) in the high proﬁts region (x1 > x0) and (26) in the

the validity of the assumption in the previous section. Notice that there is no ambiguity in

6 Conclusion

In this paper, we have kinematically derived the proﬁts distribution function in the high and
middle region from the law of detailed balance and the extended Gibrat’s law by employing
proﬁts data of Japanese companies in 2002 and 2003.

Firstly, we have reconﬁrmed Gibrat’s law in the high proﬁts region (x > x0). The value of
x0 is estimated to be about 100 million yen in Fig. 6 or 8. At the same time, we have found that
Gibrat’s law fails and another law holds in the middle proﬁts region (xmin < x < x0). We have
identiﬁed the non-Gibrat’s law and the value of xmin is estimated to be about 1, 600 thousand
yen in Fig. 6 or 8. We have called the combination of Gibrat’s law and the non-Gibrat’s law the
extended Gibrat’s law.

6

Secondly, we have derived not only Pareto’s law in the high proﬁts region but also the
distribution in the middle one from the detailed balance and the extended Gibrat’s law. The
derivation has been described uniformly in terms of the extended Gibrat’s law.

The proﬁts distribution in the middle region is very similar to log-normal one:

(36)

P (x) = Cx−

1 exp

1

2σ2 ln2 x

¯x

,

(cid:20)−
where ¯x is mean value and σ2 is variance. The diﬀerence between two distributions (22) and
(36) is only the power of x. It brings a translation along the horizontal axis in the log-log plot.
In this sense, the distribution in the middle proﬁts region obtained in this paper is essentially
equivalent to the log-normal one. Notice that it has no ﬁtting parameter that the log-normal
distribution, prepared only for data ﬁtting, has. Indies µ, α and the bounds x0, xmin is already
given in the extended Gibrat’s law.

(cid:21)

In the derivation of the proﬁts distribution, we have used the detailed balance and the ex-
tended Gibrat’s law. The detailed balance is observed in a relatively stable period in economy [5].
The extended Gibrat’s law is interpreted as follows. Companies, classiﬁed in small-scale proﬁts
category, have more (less) possibilities of increasing (decreasing) their proﬁts than companies
classiﬁed in large-scale one. In other words, it is probably diﬃcult that companies gain large-
scale proﬁts in two successive years. This is the non-Gibrat’s law and it leads the distribution
in the middle proﬁts region.

This phenomenon is not observed above the threshold x0. For x > x0, companies, classiﬁed
in small-scale proﬁts category, have same possibilities of increasing (decreasing) their proﬁts
with companies classiﬁed in large-scale one. This is the Gibrat’s law and it leads the power
distribution in the high proﬁts region.

In this paper, we cannot mention the distribution in the low proﬁts region x < xmin, because
no law is observed in the region (Fig. 6 or 8). This may be caused by insuﬃcient data in the
low region. Lastly, we speculate possible distributions in the region. If we do not take β
0
limit, we should solve the diﬀerential equation (33). The solution is given by

We have showed that a distribution function is decided by underlying kinematics. For proﬁts
data we used, the distribution is power in the high region and log-normal type in the middle one.
This does not claim that all the distributions in the middle region are log-normal types. For
instance, the personal income distribution may take a diﬀerent form, if the extended Gibrat’s
law changes. Even in the case, the other extended Gibrat’s law will decide the other distribution
by the use of the method in this paper.

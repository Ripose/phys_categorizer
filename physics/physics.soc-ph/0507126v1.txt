The scientiﬁc ﬁeld of trafﬁc engineering encompasses a rich set of mathematical techniques, as well as re-
searchers with entirely different backgrounds. This paper provides an overview of what is currently the state-
of-the-art with respect to trafﬁc ﬂow theory. Starting with a brief history, we introduce the microscopic and
macroscopic characteristics of vehicular trafﬁc ﬂows. Moving on, we review some performance indicators that
allow us to assess the quality of trafﬁc operations. A ﬁnal part of this paper discusses some of the relations
between trafﬁc ﬂow characteristics, i.e., the fundamental diagrams, and sheds some light on the different points
of view adopted by the trafﬁc engineering community.

standard or convention), one of the principal aims of this
paper is to deﬁne both a logical and consistent terminol-
ogy and notation. It is our strong belief that such a consis-
tent notation is a necessity when it comes to creating or-
der in the ‘zoo of notations’ that in our opinion currently
exists. For a concise but complete overview of all abbre-
viations and notations proposed and adopted throughout
this paper, we refer the reader to appendix A.

I. A BRIEF HISTORY OF TRAFFIC FLOW THEORY

Historically, trafﬁc engineering got its roots as a rather
practical discipline, entailing most of the time a common
sense of its practitioners to solve particular trafﬁc prob-
lems. However, all this changed at the dawn of the 1950s,
when the scientiﬁc ﬁeld began to mature, attracting engi-
neers from all sorts of trades. Most notably, John Glen
Wardrop instigated the evolving discipline now known as
trafﬁc ﬂow theory, by describing trafﬁc ﬂows using math-
ematical and statistical ideas [115].

During this highly active period, mathematics established
itself as a solid basis for theoretical analyses, a phe-
nomenon that was entirely new to the previous, more
‘rule-of-thumb’ oriented, line of reasoning. Two ex-
amples of the progress during this decade, include the
ﬂuid-dynamic model of Michael James Lighthill, Ger-
ald Beresford Whitham, and Paul Richards (or the LWR
model for short) for describing trafﬁc ﬂows [72, 102], and
the car-following experiments and theories of the club of
people working at General Motors’ research laboratory
[17, 40, 41, 50]. Simultaneous progress was also made
on the front of economic theory applied to transportation,
most notably by the publication of the ‘BMW trio’, Mar-
tin J. Beckmann, Charles Bartlett McGuire, and Christo-
pher B. Winsten [6].

From the 1960s on, the ﬁeld evolved even further with the
advent of the early personal computers (although at that
time, they could only be considered as mere computing
units). More control-oriented methods were pursued by
engineers, as a means for alleviating congestion at tun-
nels and intersections, by e.g., adaptively steering traf-
ﬁc signal timings. Nowadays, the ﬁeld has been kindly
embraced by the industry, resulting in what is called in-
telligent transportation systems (ITS), covering nearly all
aspects of the transportation community.

In spite of the intense booming during the 1950s and
1960s, all progress seemingly came to sudden stop, as
there were almost no signiﬁcant results for the next two
decades (although there are some exceptions, such as
the signiﬁcant work of Ilya Prigogine and Robert Her-
man’s, who developed a trafﬁc ﬂow model based on a
gas-kinetic analogy [101]). One of the main reasons for
this, stems from the fact that many of the involved key
players returned to their original scientiﬁc disciplines, af-
ter exhausting the application of their techniques to the
transportation problem [99]. Note that despite this calm
period, the application of control theory to transporta-

tion started ﬁnding new ways to alleviate local congestion
problems.

At the beginning of the 1990s, researchers found a re-
vived interest in the ﬁeld of trafﬁc ﬂow modelling. On the
one hand, researchers’ interests got kindled again by the
appealing simplicity of the LWR model, whereas on the
other hand one of the main boosts came from the world
of statistical physics. In this latter framework, physicists
tried to model many particle systems using simple and el-
egant behavioural rules. As an example, the now famous
particle hopping (cellular automata) model of Kai Nagel
and Michael Schreckenberg [92] still forms a widely-
cited basis for current research papers on the subject.

In parallel with this kind of modelling approach, many
of the old ‘beliefs’ (e.g., the ﬂuid-dynamic approach to
trafﬁc ﬂow modelling) started to get questioned. As a
consequence, a plethora of models quickly found its way
to the transportation community, whereby most of these
models didn’t give a thought as to whether or not their
associated phenomena corresponded to real-life trafﬁc
observations.

We note here that, whatever the modelling approach
may be, researchers should always compare their re-
sults to the reality of the physical world. Ignoring
this basic step, reduces the research in our opinion to
nothing more than a mathematical exercise !

As the international research community began to spawn
its trafﬁc ﬂow theories, Robert Herman aspired to bring
them all together in december 1959. This led to the tri-
annual organisation of the International Symposium on
Transportation and Trafﬁc Theory (ISTTT), by some her-
alded as ‘the Olympics of trafﬁc theory’ because the sym-
posium talks about the fundamentals underlying trans-
portation and trafﬁc phenomena. Another example of the
evolution of recent developments with respect to the par-
allels between trafﬁc ﬂows and granular media, is the
bi-annual organisation of the workshop on Trafﬁc and
Granular Flow (TGF), a platform for exchanging ideas
by bringing together researchers from various scientiﬁc
ﬁelds.

Nowadays, the research and application of trafﬁc ﬂow
theory and intelligent transportation systems continues.
The scientiﬁc ﬁeld has been largely diversiﬁed, encom-
passing a broad range of aspects related to sociology, psy-
chology, the environment, the economy, . . . The global
avidity of the ﬁeld can be witnessed by the exponentially
growing publication output. Keeping our previous com-
ment in mind, researchers from time to time just seem to
‘add to the noise’ (mainly due to the sheer diversity of
the literature body), although there occasionally exist ex-
ceptions such as the late Newell, as subtly pointed out by
Michael Cassidy in [100].

As a ﬁnal word, we refer the reader to two personalised
views on the history of trafﬁc ﬂow theory, namely the
musings of the late Gordon Newell and Denos Gazis
[42, 99]. We furthermore invite the reader to cast a glance
at the ending pages of Wardrop’s paper [115], in which a
rather colourful discussion on the introduction of mathe-
matics to trafﬁc ﬂow theory has been written down.

II. MICROSCOPIC TRAFFIC FLOW
CHARACTERISTICS

Road trafﬁc ﬂows are composed of drivers associated
with individual vehicles, each of them having their own
characteristics. These characteristics are called micro-
scopic when a trafﬁc ﬂow is considered as being com-
posed of such a stream of vehicles. The dynamical as-
pects of these trafﬁc ﬂows are formed by the underly-
ing interactions between the drivers of the vehicles. This
is largely determined by the behaviour of each driver, as
well as the physical characteristics of the vehicles.

Because the process of participating in a trafﬁc ﬂow is
heavily based on the behavioural aspects associated with
human drivers [39], it would seem important to include
these human factors into the modelling equations.
However, this leads to a severe increase in complexity,
which is not always a desired artifact [76]. However,
in the remainder of this section, we always consider
a vehicle-driver combination as a single entity, taking
only into account some vehicle related trafﬁc ﬂow
characteristics.

Note that despite our previous remarks, we do not
debate the necessity of a psychological treatment of
trafﬁc ﬂow theory. As the research into driver be-
haviour is gaining momentum, a lot of attention is
gained by promising studies aimed towards driver
and pedestrian safety, average reaction times, the in-
ﬂuence of stress levels, aural and visual perceptions,
ageing, medical conditions, fatigue, . . .

in the forming of congestion at bridges and tunnels. We
do not use the derivative of the acceleration, called jerk,
jolt, or surge (jerk is also used to represent the smooth-
ness of the acceleration noise [82]).

Except in the acceleration capabilities of a vehicle, we
ignore the physical forces that act on a vehicle, e.g., the
earth’s gravitational pull, road and wind friction, cen-
trifugal forces, . . . A more elaborate explanation of these
forces can be found in [27].

B. Trafﬁc ﬂow characteristics

Referring to Fig. 1, we can consider two consecutive ve-
hicles in the same lane in a trafﬁc stream: a follower i and
its leader i + 1. From the ﬁgure, it can be seen that vehi-
cle i has a certain space headway hsi to its predecessor (it
is expressed in metres), composed of the distance (called
the space gap) gsi to this leader and its own length li:

hsi = gsi + li.

(1)

By taking, as stated before, the rear bumper as a vehicle’s
position, the space headway hsi = xi+1 − xi. The space
gap is thus measured from a vehicle’s front bumper to its
leader’s rear bumper.

A. Vehicle related variables

(i + 1)

(i)

hsi

Considering individual vehicles, we can say that each ve-
hicle i in a lane of a trafﬁc stream has the following in-
formational variables:

• a length, denoted by li,

• a longitudinal position, denoted by xi,

• a speed, denoted by vi =

dxi
dt

,

• and an acceleration, denoted by ai =

dvi
dt

=

d2xi
dt2 .

Note that the position xi of a vehicle is typically taken
to be the position of its rear bumper.
In this ﬁrst ap-
proach, a vehicle’s other spatial characteristics (i.e., its
width, height, and lane number) are neglected. And in
spite of our narrow focus on the vehicle itself, the above
list of variables is also complemented with a driver’s re-
action time, denoted by τi.
With respect to the acceleration characteristics, it should
be noted that these are in fact not only dependent on the
vehicle’s engine, but also on e.g., the road’s inclination,
being a non-negligible factor that plays an important role

FIG. 1: Two consecutive vehicles (a follower i at position xi
and a leader i + 1 at position xi+1) in the same lane in a trafﬁc
stream. The follower has a certain space headway hsi to its
leader, equal to the sum of the vehicle’s space gap gsi and its
length li.

Analogously to equation (1), each vehicle also has a time
headway hti (expressed in seconds), consisting of a time
gap gti and an occupancy time ρi:

hti = gti + ρi.

(2)

Both space and time headways can be visualised in a
time-space diagram, such as the one in Fig. 2. Here,
we have shown the two vehicles i and i + 1 as they are
driving. Their positions xi and xi+1 can be plotted with
respect to time, tracing out two vehicle trajectories. As
the time direction is horizontal and the space direction
is vertical, the vehicles’ respective speeds can be derived
by taking the tangents of the trajectories (for simplicity,
we have assumed that both vehicles travel at the same
constant speed, resulting in parallel linear trajectories).

FIG. 2: A time-space diagram showing two vehicle trajectories
i and i + 1, as well as the space and time headway hsi and
hti of vehicle i. Both headways are composed of the space
gap gsi and the vehicle length li, and the time gap gti and the
occupancy time ρi, respectively. The time headway can be seen
as the difference in time instants between the passing of both
vehicles, respectively at ti+1 and ti (diagram based on [74]).

Accelerating vehicles have steep inclining trajectories,
whereas those of stopped vehicles are horizontal.

When the vehicle’s speed is constant, the time gap is the
amount of time necessary to reach the current position of
the leader when travelling at the current speed (i.e., it is
the elapsed time an observer at a ﬁxed location would
measure between the passing of two consecutive vehi-
cles). Similarly, the occupancy time can be interpreted
as the time needed to traverse a distance equal to the ve-
hicle’s own length at the current speed, i.e., ρi = li/vi;
this corresponds to the time the vehicle needs to pass the
observer’s location. Both equations (1) and (2) are fur-
thermore linked to the vehicle’s speed vi as follows [27]:

introduced in a similar fashion. The extra time gaps and
headways are derived in complete analogy, leading to the
four time gaps gl,f

, and hr,b
responding time headways hl,f

In single-lane trafﬁc, vehicles always keep their relative
order, a principle sometimes called ﬁrst-in, ﬁrst-out
(FIFO) [24]. For multi-lane trafﬁc however, this princi-
ple is no longer obeyed due to overtaking manoeuvres,
resulting in vehicle trajectories that cross each other.
If the same time-space diagram were to be drawn for
only one lane (in multi-lane trafﬁc), then some vehicles’

trajectories would suddenly appear or vanish at the point
where a lane change occurred.

In some trafﬁc ﬂow literature, other nomenclature is
used: space for the space headway, distance or clear-
ance for the space gap, and headway for the time
headway. Because this terminology is confusing, we
propose to use the unambiguously deﬁned terms as
described in this section.

III. MACROSCOPIC TRAFFIC FLOW
CHARACTERISTICS

When considering many vehicles simultaneously,
time-space diagram mentioned in section II B can be used
to faithfully represent all trafﬁc. In Fig. 3 we show the
evolution of the system, as we have traced the trajecto-
ries of all the individual vehicles’ movements. This time-
space diagram therefore provides a complete picture of
all trafﬁc operations that are taking place (accelerations,
decelerations, . . . ).

FIG. 3: A time-space diagram showing several vehicle trajec-
tories and three measurement regions Rt, Rs, and Rt,s. These
rectangular regions are bounded in time and space by a mea-
surement period Tmp and a road section of length K. The black
dots represent the individual measurements.

Instead of considering each vehicle in a trafﬁc stream
individually, we now ‘zoom out’ to a more aggregate
macroscopic level (trafﬁc streams are regarded e.g., as
a ﬂuid). In the remainder of this section, we will mea-
sure some macroscopic trafﬁc ﬂow characteristics based
on the shown time-space diagram. To this end, we deﬁne
three measurement regions:

• Rt corresponding to measurements at a single ﬁxed
location in space (dx), during a certain time period
Tmp. An example of this is a single inductive loop
detector (SLD) embedded in the road’s concrete.

• Rs corresponding to measurements at a single in-
stant in time (dt), over a certain road section of
length K. An example of this is an aerial photo-
graph.

• Rt,s corresponding to a general measurement re-
gion. Although it can have any shape, in this case
we restrict ourselves to a rectangular region in time
and space. An example of this is a sequence of im-
ages made by a video camera detector.

With respect to the size of these measurement regions,
some caution is advised: a too large measurement region
can mask certain effects of trafﬁc ﬂows, possibly ignoring
some of the dynamic properties, whereas a too small mea-
surement region may obstruct a continuous treatment, as
the discrete, microscopic nature of trafﬁc ﬂows becomes
apparent.

Using these different methods of observation, we now
discuss the measurement of four important macroscopic
trafﬁc ﬂow characteristics: density, ﬂow, occupancy, and
mean speed. We furthermore give a short discussion on
the moving observer method and the use of ﬂoating car
data.

With respect to some naming conventions on road-
ways, two different ‘standards’ exist for some of the
encountered terminology, namely the American and
the British standard. Examples are: the classic multi-
lane high-speed road with on- and off-ramps, which
is called a freeway or a super highway (American), or
an arterial or motorway (British). A main road with
intersections is called an urban highway (American)
or a carriageway (British). In this dissertation, we
have chosen to adopt the British standard. Finally, in
contrast to Great Britain and Australia, we assume
that for low-density trafﬁc, everybody drives on the
right instead of the left lane.

A. Density

The macroscopic characteristic called density allows us
to get an idea of how crowded a certain section of a road
It is typically expressed in number of vehicles per
is.
kilometre (or mile). Note that the concept of density to-
tally ignores the effects of trafﬁc composition and vehicle
lengths, as it only considers the abstract quantity ‘number
of vehicles’.

Because density can only be measured in a certain spatial
region (e.g., Rs in Fig. 3), it is computed for temporal re-
gions such as region Rt in Fig. 3. When density can not
be exactly measured or computed, or when density mea-
surements are faulty, it has to be estimated. To this end,
several available techniques exist e.g., based on explicit
simulation using a trafﬁc ﬂow propagation model [90],
based on a vehicle reidentiﬁcation system [21], based
on a complete trafﬁc state estimator using an extended
Kalman ﬁlter [114], or based on a non-linear adaptive ob-
server [3], . . .

1. Mathematical formulation

Using the spatial region Rs, the density k for single-lane
trafﬁc is deﬁned as:

k =

N
K

,

(4)

with N the number of vehicles present on the road seg-
ment. If we consider multi-lane trafﬁc, we have to sum
the partial densities kl of each of the L lanes as follows:

k =

kl =

Nl,

(5)

L

l=1
X

1
K

L

l=1
X

in which Nl now denotes the number of vehicles present
in lane l (equation (5) is not the same as averaging over
the partial densities of each lane)[122].

In general, density can be deﬁned as the total time spent
by all the vehicles in the measurement region, divided by
the area of this region [27, 36]. This generalisation al-
lows us to compute the density at a point using the mea-
surement region Rt:

N

with Ti the travel time and vi the speed of the ith vehicle.
Extending the previous derivation to multi-lane trafﬁc is
done straightforward using equation (5):

Tmp

L

Nl

(7)

i=1

l=1

with now vi,l denoting the speed of the ith vehicle in lane
l.
As we now can obtain the density in both spatial and tem-
poral regions, Rs and Rt respectively, it would seem a
logical extension to ﬁnd the density in the region Rt,s.
In order to do this, however, we need to know the travel
times Ti of the individual vehicles, as can be seen in equa-
tion (6). Because this information is not always available,
and in most cases rather difﬁcult to measure, we use a dif-
ferent approach, corresponding to the temporal average
of the density. Assuming that at each time step t, during
a certain time period Tmp, the density k(t) is known in
consecutive regions Rs, the generalised deﬁnition leads
to the following formulation:

For multi-lane trafﬁc, combining equations (5) and (8)
results in the following formula for computing the density
in region Rt,s using measurements in discrete time:

where Nl(t) denotes the number of vehicles present in

There exists a relation between the macroscopic trafﬁc
ﬂow characteristics and those microscopic characteristics
deﬁned in section II B. For the density k, this relation is
based on the average space headway hs [27, 115]:

2. Passenger car units

When considering heterogeneous trafﬁc ﬂows (i.e.,
trafﬁc streams composed of different types of vehicles),
operating agencies usually don’t express the macroscopic
trafﬁc ﬂow characteristics using the raw number of vehi-
cles, but rather employ the notion of passenger car units
(PCU). These PCUs, sometimes also called passenger
car equivalents (PCE), try to take into account the spatial
differences between vehicle types. For example, by
denoting one average passenger car as 1 PCU, a truck in
the same trafﬁc stream can be considered as 2 PCUs (or
even higher and fractional values for trailer trucks).

Let us ﬁnally note that, because density is essentially
deﬁned as a spatial measurement, it is one of the
most difﬁcult quantities to obtain. It is interesting to
notice that at this moment, it is theoretically possible
for video cameras to measure density over a short
spatial region. However, to our knowledge there cur-
rently exists no commercial implementation.

B. Flow

Whereas density typically is a spatial measurement, ﬂow
can be considered as a temporal measurement (i.e., re-
gion Rt). Flow, which we use as a shorthand for rate
of ﬂow, is typically expressed as an hourly rate, i.e., in
number of vehicles per hour. Note that sometimes other
synonyms such as intensity, ﬂux, throughput, current, or
volume[123] are used, typically depending on a person’s
scientiﬁc background (e.g., engineering, physics, . . . ).

Measuring the ﬂow q in region Rt for single-lane trafﬁc,
is done using the following equation, which is based on
raw vehicle counts:

q =

N
Tmp

,

(11)

with N the number of vehicles that has passed the detec-
tor’s site. For multi-lane trafﬁc, we sum the partial ﬂows
of each of the L lanes:

q =

ql =

Nl,

(12)

L

l=1
X

1
Tmp

L

l=1
X

with now Nl denoting the number of vehicles that passed
the detector’s site in lane l. Note that we assume that each
lane has its own detector, otherwise we would be dealing
with an average ﬂow across all the lanes.

Generally speaking, ﬂow can deﬁned as the total distance
travelled by all the vehicles in the measurement region,
divided by the area of this region [27, 36]. In analogy
with equation (6), this generalisation allows us to com-
pute the ﬂow using the spatial measurement region Rs:

N

i=1

with now Xi the distance travelled by the ith vehicle dur-

multi-lane trafﬁc is straightforward:

q =

vi,l.

(14)

Considering consecutive ﬂow measurements in region
Rt,s, we can derive a formulation corresponding to the
temporal average of the ﬂow, similar to that of equation
(8). Assuming that at each time step t, during a certain
time period Tmp, the ﬂow q(t) is known in consecutive re-
gions Rs, the generalised deﬁnition leads to the following
equations:

q =

2. Oblique cumulative plots

As stated before, ﬂows are always expressed as a rate.
In contrast to this, we can also consider the raw vehi-
cle counts at a certain location (i.e., measurement region
Rt).
If we plot the cumulative number of passing ve-
hicles (denoted by N ) with respect to time for different
regions (e.g., inductive loop detectors), we get a set of
curves such as the one in the left part of Fig. 4. These
curves are called cumulative plots (or (t, N ) diagrams),
and although their origins date back as far as 1954 with
the work of Karl Moskowitz [83], it was Gordon Newell
who applied them later on to their full potential (initially
in the context of queueing theory) [95, 96, 97, 98] (a sim-
ilar method was applied by John Luke, in the ﬁeld of con-
tinuum mechanics [25, 75]).

The key beneﬁt of these cumulative plots, comes when
comparing observations stemming from multiple detector
stations at a closed section of the road that conserves the
number of vehicles (i.e., no on- or off-ramps), in which
case we also speak of input-output diagrams. If there are
two detector stations, then the upstream and downstream
stations measure the input, respectively output, of the
section. Similarly like in queueing theory, the upstream
curve is sometimes called the arrival function, whereas
the downstream one is called the departure function [95].
As the method is based on counting the number of in-
dividual vehicles at each observation location (whereby
each vehicle is numbered with respect to a single refer-
ence vehicle), this results in a monotonically increasing
function N (t) (sometimes called the Moskowitz function,
after its ‘inventor’), which increases each time a vehicles
passes by. At each time instant t, the cumulative count is

FIG. 4: Left: a standard cumulative plot showing the number
of passing vehicles at two detector locations; due to the graph’s
scale, both curves appear to lie on top of each other. Right:
the same data but displayed using an oblique coordinate sys-
tem, thereby enhancing the visibility (the dashed slanted lines
have a slope corresponding to the subtracted background ﬂow
qb ≈ 4100 vehicles per hour). We can see a queue (probably
caused due to an incident) growing at approximately 11:00, dis-
sipating some time later at approximately 12:30. The shown de-
tector data was taken from single inductive loop detectors [113],
covering all three lanes of the E40 motorway between Erpe-
Mere and Wetteren, Belgium. The shown data was recorded at
Monday April 4th, 2003 (the detectors’ sampling interval was
one minute, the distance between the upstream and downstream
detector stations was 8.1 kilometres).

N (t) =

q(t′) = N (t − 1) + q(t).

The time needed to travel from one location to another
can easily be measured as the horizontal distance be-
tween the respective cumulative curves. Similarly, the
vertical distance between these curves allows us to derive
the accumulation of vehicles on the road section, which

gives an excellent indication of growing and dissipating
queues (i.e., congestion). Furthermore, if we compute
the slope of this function at each time instant t, we ob-
tain the ﬂow q(t) = [N (t + ∆t) − N (t)]/∆t. Finally,
because N (t) essentially is a step function, we can deﬁne
a smooth approximation
N (t). This results in an every-
where differentiable function, allowing us to compute in-
stantaneous ﬂows and local densities as q = ∂
N (t, x)/∂t
and k = −∂

e
N (t, x)/∂x, respectively [27].

The main disadvantage of the method is the fact that
these cumulative functions increase very rapidly, thereby
masking the subtle differences between different curves.
Cassidy and Windover therefore proposed to subtract
a background ﬂow qb from these curves, resulting in
functions N (t) − t qb [13]. Based on this; Mu˜noz and
Daganzo furthermore introduced enhanced clarity by
overlaying this cumulative plot with a set of oblique
lines with slope −qb [88]. Choosing an appropriate value
for qb, allows us to nicely enhance the characteristic
undulations that are expressed by the different oblique
curves.

Note that before using these oblique plots, the cumu-
lative plots from different detectors stations need to
be synchronised. To understand this, suppose a ref-
erence vehicle passes an upstream detector station at
a certain time instant tup; after a certain time period,
the vehicle reaches the downstream detector station
at a later time instant tdown. The amount tdown − tup
is the time it takes to cross the distance between
both detector stations, allowing the synchronisation
mechanism to shift the respective cumulative curves
over this time period (i.e., initialising them with the
passing of the reference vehicle).

One way to achieve this, is by looking at the re-
spective shapes of both cumulative curves during
light trafﬁc conditions (e.g., the early morning pe-
riod when free-ﬂow conditions are prevailing). The
idea now is to shift one curve such that the dif-
ference between the two curves’ shapes is minimal
[86, 89, 118]. Note that other corrections may be
necessary, as both detector stations can count a dif-
ferent number of vehicles (i.e., a systematic bias).

An example of an oblique plot can be seen in the right part
of Fig. 4: the cumulative count at each time instant can
be read from an axis that is perpendicular to the oblique
(slanted) overlayed dashed lines (e.g., we can see a count
of some 30000 vehicles at 14:00). Note that the accu-
mulation can still be measured by the vertical distance
between two curves (i.e., at a speciﬁc time instant), but
the travel time should now be measured along one of the
overlayed oblique lines. Such a pair of cumulative curves
can be thought of as a ﬂexible plastic garden hose: when-
ever there is an obstruction on the road, the outﬂow of
the section will be blocked, resulting in a local thicken-
ing of this ‘hose’ (i.e., the accumulation of vehicles on
the section).

Using these oblique cumulative plots, we can now inspect
the trafﬁc dynamics in much more detail than was previ-

ously possible. For example, looking again at the right
part of Fig. 4, we can see how the speciﬁc trafﬁc stream
characteristics propagate from one detector station to an-
other. Even more visible, is a queue that starts to grow
at approximately 11:00 (i.e., the time of the appearance
of a ‘bulge’), dissipating at approximately 12:30. As
data curves from upstream detectors lie above data curves
from downstream detectors, we see a decrease in the road
section’s output. Careful investigation of the trafﬁc data
revealed that the detector stations recorded a rather low
ﬂow (approximately 2500 vehicles per hour as opposed
to a nominal ﬂow of 4500 vehicles per hour), whereby all
vehicles drove at a low speed (between 20 and 60 km/h
as opposed to 110 km/h). This gives sufﬁcient evidence
to conclude that an incident probably occurred shortly af-
ter 11:00, consequently obstructing a part of the road and
leading to a build up of vehicles in the section.

Let us ﬁnally note that although oblique cumulative plots
currently are not a mainstream technique used by the traf-
ﬁc community, we predict their rising popularity: they
are one of the most simple, yet powerful, techniques for
studying local trafﬁc phenomena, giving trafﬁc engineers
practical insight into the formation of bottlenecks. Some
recent examples include the work of Mu˜noz and Daganzo
[85, 86, 87, 89], Cassidy and Bertini [7, 15], Cassidy and
Mauch [16], and Bertini et al. [8].

C. Occupancy

Notwithstanding the importance of measuring trafﬁc den-
sity, most of the existing detector stations on the road are
only capable of temporal measurements (i.e., region Rt).
If individual vehicle speeds can be measured, by double
inductive loop detectors (DLD) for example, then density
should be computed using equation (6).

However, in many cases these vehicle speeds are not
readily available, e.g., when using single inductive loop
detectors. The detector’s logic therefore resorts to a tem-
poral measurement called the occupancy ρ, which corre-
sponds to the fraction of time the measurement location
was occupied by a vehicle:

ρ =

1
Tmp

oti .

N

i=1
X

(19)

In the previous equation, oti denotes the ith vehicle’s on-
time, i.e., the time period during which it is present above
the detector (it corresponds to the shaded area swept by
a vehicle at a certain location xi in Fig. 2). Note that
this on-time actually corresponds to the effective vehicle
length as seen by the detector, divided by the vehicle’s
speed [20]:

oti =

li + Kld
vi

,

(20)

with li the vehicle’s true length and Kld > dx the ﬁnite,
non-inﬁnitesimal length of the detection zone. If we de-
ﬁne ot as the average on-time (based on the vehicles that
have passed the detector during the observation period),
then we can establish a relation between the occupancy
and the ﬂow [27] using equations (11) and (19):

ρ =

N
Tmp (cid:19)  

1
N

(cid:18)

N

i=1
X

!

oti

= q ot.

(21)

Furthermore, it is as before possible to deﬁne the oc-
cupancy for generalised measurement regions, using the
total space consumed by the shaded areas of vehicles
in a time-space diagram (e.g., Fig. 2), divided by the
area of the measurement region [14, 27, 36]. Continu-
ing our discussion, assume that individual vehicle lengths
and speeds are uncorrelated; it can then be shown that
[20, 27]:

ρ = l k =⇒ k =

(22)

ρ
l

,

with l the average vehicle length (note that this can corre-
spond to the concept of passenger car units deﬁned in sec-
tion III A). Multiplying equation (22) by 100, allows us
to express the occupancy as a percentage. For multi-lane
trafﬁc, the occupancy is derived in analogy to equation
(7):

ρ =

ρl =

oti,l ,

(23)

L

i=1
X

1
Tmp

L

Nl

l=1
X

i=1
X

with now oti,l the on-time of the ith vehicle in lane l. Note
that the total occupancy derived in this way, can exceed
1 (but is bounded by L); if desired, it can be normalised
through a division by L to obtain the average occupancy.

Note that if we apply equation (22) to measurement re-
gion Rs based on the density in equation (4), then the
occupancy ρ can be written as:

ρ =

1
(cid:26)(cid:26)N

 

N

i=1
X

(cid:26)(cid:26)N
K

1
K

li

i=1

(24)

So the occupancy now represents the ‘real density’ of the
road, i.e., the physical space that all vehicles occupy.

D. Mean speed

The ﬁnal macroscopic characteristic to be considered, is
the mean speed of a trafﬁc stream; it is expressed in
kilometres (or miles) per hour (the inverse of a vehicle’s
speed is called its pace). Note that speed is not to be
confused with velocity; the latter is actually a vector, im-
plying a direction, whereas the former could be regarded
as the norm of this vector.

1. Mathematical formulation

If we base our approach on direct measurements of the
individual vehicles’ speeds, we can generally obtain the
mean speed as the total distance travelled by all the vehi-
cles in the measurement region, divided by the total time
spent in this region [27, 36]. This gives the following
derivations for the spatial and temporal regions, Rs and
Rt respectively:

vi (region Rs),

(region Rt),

(25)

with now Xi and Ti the distance, respectively time, trav-
elled by the ith vehicle and N the number of vehicles
present during the measurement. The mean speed com-
puted by the previous equations, is called the average
travel speed (the computation also includes stopped vehi-
cles), which is more commonly known as the space-mean
speed (SMS); we denote it with vs (note that in some en-
gineering disciplines, the sole letter u is used to denote a
mean speed, however, this is ambiguous in our opinion).

It is interesting to see that the spatial measurement is
based on an arithmetic average of the vehicles’ instan-
taneous speeds, whereas the temporal measurement is
based on the harmonic average of the vehicles’ spot
speeds. If we instead were to take the arithmetic average
of the vehicles’ spot speeds in the temporal measurement
region Rt, this would lead to what is called the time-mean
speed (TMS); we denote it by vt:

In the past, density was sometimes referred to as
concentration. Nowadays however, concentration is
used in a more broad context, encompassing both
density and occupancy whereby the former is meant
to be a spatial measurement, as opposed to the latter
which is considered to be a temporal measurement
[39].

vt =

(region Rt).

Similarly, we can compute the time-mean speed for mea-
surement region Rs, by taking the harmonic average of
the vehicles’ instantaneous speeds. With respect to both

space- and time-mean speeds, Wardrop has shown that
the following relation holds [115]:

as follows:

vt = vs +

(vi − vs)2,

(28)

in which vi denotes the ith vehicle’s instantaneous speed.
One of the main consequences of equation (27), is that the
time-mean speed always exceeds the space-mean speed
(except when all the vehicles’ speeds are the same, in
which case the sample variance is zero and, as a conse-
quence, the time- and space-mean speeds are equal). So a
stationary observer will most likely see more faster than
slower vehicles passing by, as opposed to e.g., an aerial
photograph in which more slower than faster vehicles will
be seen [27]. Despite this mathematical quirk, the practi-
cal difference between SMS and TMS is often negligible
for free-ﬂow trafﬁc (i.e., light trafﬁc conditions); how-
ever, under congested trafﬁc conditions both mean speeds
will behave substantially differently (i.e., around 10%).

Using equation (27), we can also estimate the space-mean
speed, based on the time-mean speed and approximating
the variance of the SMS with that of the TMS [9]:

2. Fundamental relation of trafﬁc ﬂow theory

There exists a unique relation between three of the previ-
ously discussed macroscopic trafﬁc ﬂow characteristics
density k, ﬂow q, and space-mean speed vs [115]:

q = k vs.

(31)

This relation is also called the fundamental relation of
trafﬁc ﬂow theory, as it provides a close bond between
the three quantities: knowing two of them allows us to
calculate the third one (note that the time-mean speed in
equation (26) does not obey this relation).
In general
however, there are two restrictions, i.e., the relation is
only valid for (1) continuous variables[124], or smooth
approximations of them, and (2) trafﬁc composed of sub-
streams (e.g., slow and fast vehicles) which comply to the
following two assumptions:

Homogeneous trafﬁc

There is a homogeneous composition of the
trafﬁc substream (i.e., the same type of vehi-
cles).

Stationary trafﬁc

When observing the trafﬁc substream at dif-
ferent times and locations, it ‘looks the same’.
Putting it a bit more quantitatively, all the
vehicles’ trajectories should be parallel and
equidistant [27]. A stationary time period
can be seen in a cumulative plot (e.g., Fig. 4)
where the curve corresponds to a linear func-
tion.

vs ≈

∀ vt ≥ 2 σt.
(29)

In general, using the space-mean speed is preferred to the
time-mean speed. However, in most cases only this latter
trafﬁc ﬂow characteristic is available, so care should be
taken when interpreting the results of a study (unless of
course when SMS and TMS are negligibly different).

The extension of equation (25) to multi-lane is straight-
forward; for example, the space-mean speed is computed

The latter of the above two conditions, is also referred
to as trafﬁc operating in a steady state or at equilibrium.
Based on equations (5) and (12) using partial densities
and ﬂows for different substreams (e.g., vehicle classes
with distinct travel speeds, macroscopic characteristics
of different lanes, . . . ), we can now calculate the space-
mean speed, using relation (31), in the following equiva-
lent ways:

(33)

(34)

in which C denotes the number of substreams, qc, kc, vsc,
and vtc the ﬂow, density, space, and time-mean speed re-
spectively of the c-th substream. In the above derivations,
equation (32) should be used when both the ﬂows and
densities are known, equation (33) should be used when
both the ﬂows and space-mean speeds are known, and
equation (34) should be used when both the densities and
space-mean speeds are known.

As can be seen in equation (34), the space-mean speed
is calculated by averaging the substreams’ space-mean
speeds using their densities as weighting factors. Simi-
larly, the time-mean speed can be derived by using the
ﬂows as weighting factors for the substreams’ time-mean
speeds:

vt =

qc vtc

Because density can not always be easily measured, we
can compute it using the fundamental relation (31). Den-
sity can then be directly derived from ﬂow and space-
mean speed measurements, or if the latter are not avail-
able, they can be estimated from occupancy measure-
ments; in [20, 21, 22], Coifman provides a nice set of
techniques for dealing with these difﬁculties.

E. Moving observer method and ﬂoating car data

When measuring and/or computing the macroscopic traf-
ﬁc ﬂow characteristics in the previous sections, we al-
ways assumed a ﬁxed measurement region. There exists
however yet another method, based on what is called a
moving observer [116]. The idea behind the technique
is to have a vehicle drive in both directions of a trafﬁc
ﬂow, each time recording the number of oncoming vehi-
cles and the net number of vehicles it gets overtaken by,
as well as the times necessary to complete the two trips.
Note that the assumption of stationary trafﬁc still has to
hold, i.e., the round trip should be completed before traf-
ﬁc conditions change signiﬁcantly.

Using this method, it is then possible to derive the ﬂow
and density of the trafﬁc stream in the direction of interest
[27, 39]. However, the main disadvantage of this method
is that, in order to obtain an acceptable level of accuracy

on a road with a low ﬂow, a very large number of trips are
required [39, 84, 116].

One of the techniques that has entered the picture dur-
ing the last decade, is the use of so-called ﬂoating cars
or probe vehicles. They can be compared to the mov-
ing observer method, but in this case, the vehicles are
equipped with GPS and GSM(C)/GPRS devices that de-
termine their locations based on the USA’s NAVSTAR-
GPS (or Europe’s planned GNSS Galileo), and transmit
this information to some operator. Initially, this allows an
agency, e.g., a parcel delivery service, to track its vehicles
throughout a network, based on their locations. Nowa-
days, the technique has evolved, resulting in several com-
pleted ﬁeld tests of which the main goal was to estimate
the trafﬁc conditions based on a small number of probe
vehicles. During ﬁeld measurements, ﬂoating cars can
mimic several types of behaviour, most notably by travel-
ling at the trafﬁc ﬂows’ mean speed, or by trying to travel
at the road’s speed limit, or even by chasing another ran-
domly selected vehicle from the trafﬁc stream.

Some examples of studies and experiments with ﬂoating
car data (FCD) are given in the following. Firstly, Fasten-
rath gives an overview of a telematic ﬁeld trial (VEhicle
Relayed Dynamic Information, VERDI) that addresses
issues such as economical, political, and technical con-
straints [38]. Secondly, Westerman provides an overview
of available techniques for obtaining real-time road traf-
ﬁc information, with the goal of controlling the trafﬁc
ﬂows through telematics [118], and Wermuth et al. de-
scribe a ‘TeleTravel System’ used for surveying individ-
ual travel behaviour [117]. Then, Taale et al. compare
travel times from ﬂoating car data with measured travel
times (using a ﬂeet of sixty equipped vehicles driving
around in Rotterdam, The Netherlands), concluding that
they correspond reasonably well [107]. Next, Michler
derives the minimum percentage of vehicles necessary,
in order to estimate trafﬁc stream characteristics for cer-
tain trafﬁc patterns (e.g., free-ﬂow and congested trafﬁc)
based on rigid statistical grounds [81], and Linauer and
Leihs measure the travel time between points in a road
network, based on a high number of users that submit a
low number of GSM hand-over messages [73]. In addi-
tion, Demir et al. accurately reconstruct link travel times
during periods of trafﬁc congestion, using only a very
limited number of FCD-messages with a small number
of users [33]. A ﬁnal, more regional, example is the
founding of the government-supported Belgian ‘Telem-
atics Cluster’[125], a platform for encouraging the use
of telematics solutions for ITS. The initiative already in-
cludes some 57 members, stimulating the cooperation be-
tween users, telecommunication companies, and the au-
tomotive industry.

In conclusion, we can state that the use of probe vehicles
provides an effective way to gather accurate current
travel times in a road network, thereby allowing good up-
to-date estimations of trafﬁc conditions. The technique
will continue to grow and evolve, already by introducing
personalised trafﬁc information to drivers, based on their
location and the surrounding trafﬁc conditions. This
development is furthermore stimulated by the fact that
GSM market penetration still rises above 70% [73], and

it is our belief this will also be the case for personal GPS
devices and in-vehicle route planners.

B. Travel times and their reliability

Despite the obvious major advantage of obtaining
accurate information on the trafﬁc conditions, the
technique suffers from a jurisprudential battle, in that
there are many delicately privacy concerns involved
with respect to the mobile operator that wants to
track individual people’s units (not to mention the
monetary cost associated with the numerously in-
duced communications).

IV. PERFORMANCE INDICATORS

After considering the previously mentioned macroscopic
trafﬁc ﬂow characteristics, we now take a look at some
popular performance indicators used by trafﬁc engineers
when assessing the quality of trafﬁc operations. We con-
cisely discuss the peak hour factor, the reliability of travel
times, the levels of service, and a measure of efﬁciency
of a road. For a more complete overview, we refer the
reader to [105].

A. Peak hour factor

During high ﬂow periods in the peak hour, a possible in-
dicator for trafﬁc ﬂow ﬂuctuations is the so-called peak
hour factor (PHF). It is calculated for one day as the aver-
age ﬂow during the hour with the maximum ﬂow, divided
by the peak ﬂow rate during one quarter hour within this
hour [79]:

PHF =

q|60
q|15

.

(36)

For example, suppose we measure ﬂows on a main unidi-
rectional road with three lanes, during a morning peak:
from 07:00 to 08:00 we measure consecutively 3500,
6600, 6200, and 4500 vehicles/hour during each quarter.
The total average ﬂow q|60 is 5200 vehicles/hour, with a
peak 15 minute ﬂow rate q|15 = 6600 vehicles/hour. The
PHF is therefore equal to 5200/6600 = 0.78.

Note that some manuals express the peak 15 minute ﬂow
rate as the number of vehicles during that quarter hour,
necessitating an extra multiplication by 4 in the denomi-
nator of equation (36) to convert the ﬂow rate to an hourly
rate.

We can immediately see that the PHF is constrained to
the interval [0.25,1.00]; the higher the PHF, the ﬂatter the
peak period (i.e., a longer sustained state of high ﬂow).
Typically, the PHF has values around 0.7 – 0.98. Note
that two of the obvious problems with the PHF are, on
the one hand, the question of when to pick the correct 15
minute interval, and on the other hand the fact that some
peak periods may last longer than one hour.

When travelling around, people like to know how long a
speciﬁc journey will take (e.g., by public transport, car,
bicycle, . . . ). This notion of an expected travel time, is
one of the most tangible aspects of journeying as per-
ceived by the travellers. When people are travelling to
their work, they are required to arrive on time at their des-
tinations. Based on this premise, we can naturally state
that people reason with a built-in safety margin: they con-
sider the average time it takes to reach a destination, and
use this to decide about their departure time.

Aside from the above obvious human rationale, there is
also an increased interest in obtaining precise informa-
tion with respect to travel times in the context of ad-
vanced traveller information systems (ATIS). Here, an
essential ingredient is the accurate prediction of future
travel times. Coupled with incident detection for exam-
ple, drivers can obtain correct travel time information,
thereby staying informed of the actual trafﬁc conditions
and possibly changing their journey. The requested in-
formation can reach the driver by means of a cell-phone
(e.g., as a feature offered by the mobile service provider),
it can be broadcasted over radio (e.g., the Trafﬁc Message
Channel – TMC), or it can be displayed using variable
message signs (VMS) above certain road sections (e.g.,
dynamic route information panels – DRIPs), . . .

1. Travel time deﬁnitions

The travel time of a driver completing a journey, can be
deﬁned as ‘the time necessary to traverse a route between
any two points of interest’ [111]. In this context, the ex-
perienced dynamic travel time, starting at a certain time
t0, over a road section of length K is deﬁned as follows
[9]:

T (t0) =

K

1
v(t, x)

dx

0
Z

∀ t ≥ t0,

(37)

for which it is assumed that all local instantaneous ve-
hicle speeds v(t, x) are known at all points along the
route, and at all time instants (hence the term dynamic
travel time). In most cases however, we do not know all
the v(t, x), but only a ﬁnite subset of them, deﬁned by
the locations of the detector stations (demarcating section
boundaries). The travel time can then be approximated
using the recorded speeds at the beginning and end of a
section (there is an underlying assumption here, namely
that vehicles travel at a more or less constant speed be-
tween detector locations). As stated earlier, the experi-
enced travel time requires the knowledge of local vehicle
speeds at all time instants after T0. Because this is not
always possible, a simpliﬁcation can be used, resulting in
the so-called experienced instantaneous travel time:

K

T (t0) =

(38)

In general, we can derive the travel time using equation
(25), i.e., the total distance travelled by all the vehicles,
divided by their space-mean speed:

time during the day for these curves, is depicted in the
top part of Fig. 5. The derived histogram (indicative of
the underlying travel time probability density function),
in the bottom part of the ﬁgure, shows that the mean travel
time during the day is approximately 4 minutes.

in which an accurate estimation of the space-mean speed
vs(t0) at time t0 is necessary (e.g., by taking the harmonic
average of the recorded spot speeds).

2. Queueing delays

Trafﬁc congestion nearly always leads to the build up of
queues, introducing an increase (i.e., the delay) in the
experienced travel time. The congestion itself can have
originated due to trafﬁc demand exceeding the capacity,
or because an incident occurred (e.g., road works, a traf-
ﬁc accident, . . . )[126]. This can create incidental (non-
recurrent) or structural (recurrent) congestion. Conges-
tion can thus be seen as a loss in travel time with respect
to some base line reference. Two such commonly used
references are the travel time under free-ﬂow conditions,
and the travel time under maximum (i.e., capacity) ﬂow.
The delay is typically expressed in vehicle hours. As
stated earlier, there are several ways to inform a driver
of the current and predicted travel time. Using DRIPs it
is possible to advertise the extra travel time (the delay is
now typically expressed in vehicle minutes), as well as
queue lengths. We note that in our opinion it is more in-
tuitive to advertise a temporal estimation (i.e., the travel
time or the delay), than a spatial estimation (e.g., the
queue length on a motorway).

3. An example of travel time estimation using cumulative
plots

There exist several techniques for estimating the cur-
rent travel time; one method for directly ‘measuring’ the
travel time, is by using a probe vehicle (we refer the
reader to section III E for more details). This way, it
is possible to extract actual travel times from a trafﬁc
stream. Note that as trafﬁc conditions get more con-
gested, more probe vehicles are required in order to ob-
tain an accurate estimation of the travel time.

Another method for measuring the travel time, is based
on historical data, namely cumulative plots (introduced
in section III B 2). As mentioned earlier, the travel time
can then be measured as the distance along the horizontal
(or oblique) time axis; any excess due to delays can then
easily be spotted on a set of oblique cumulative plots.

Based on cumulative plots of consecutive detector sta-
tions, we can calculate the travel time between the up-
stream and downstream end of a road section. To illus-
trate this, let us reconsider the cumulative curves shown
in Fig. 4 of section III B 2. The evolution of the travel

Travel time [minutes]

FIG. 5: Top: The evolution of the travel time during one day,
based on the cumulative plots from section III B 2. As can be
seen, an incident likely occurred at 11:00, increasing the travel
time from 4 to 7 minutes. Furthermore, at approximately 18:45
in the evening, all trafﬁc seemed to simultaneously slow down
for a period of some 10 minutes. Bottom: Based on the calcu-
lated travel times during the day, we can derive a histogram that
is an approximation of the underlying travel time probability
density function. The mean is located around 4 minutes.

We already mentioned the likely occurrence of an inci-
dent at 11:00, resulting in the formation of a queue. Dur-
ing this period, the travel time shot up, reaching ﬁrst 5,
then 7 minutes. Looking at the top part of Fig. 5, we fur-
thermore notice a slight increase in the travel time at ap-
proximately 18:45, for a short period of some 10 minutes.
Investigation of the detector data, revealed that the ﬂow
remained constant at about 4500 vehicles per hour, but
the speed dropped to some 90 km/h (as opposed to 110
km/h); we can conclude that all vehicles were probably
simultaneously slowing down during this period (perhaps
a rubbernecking effect). Another possibility is a platoon
of slower moving vehicles, but then it would seem to have
dissipated rather quickly after 10 minutes.

Using ample historical data, we can analyse the travel
time over a period of many weeks, months, or even years.
This would allow us to make intuitive statements such as:

“The typical travel time over this section of
the road during a working Monday, lies ap-
proximately between 4 and 6 minutes. There
is however an 8% probability that the travel
time increases to some 22 minutes (e.g., due
to an occurring incident).”

Finally note that, besides the two previously mentioned
techniques for estimating travel
times, an extensive
overview can be found in the Travel Time Data Collection
Handbook [111]. Another concise but more theoretically-
oriented overview is provided by Bovy and Thijs [9].

4. Reliability and robustness properties

As mentioned in the introduction of this section, people
reason about their expected travel times based on a built-
in safety margin. Central to this is the concept of the
average travel time. The reliability of such a travel time
is then characterised by its standard deviation. Drivers
typically accept (and sometimes expect) a small delay in
their expected travel time. A traveller knows the expected
travel time because of the familiarity with the associated
trip. To the traveller, this is personal historical informa-
tion, for instance obtained by learning the trip’s details
(e.g., the trafﬁc conditions during a typical morning rush
hour) [5].

Directly linked to the reliability of a certain expected
travel time, is its variability. They are said to be unre-
liable when both expected and experienced travel times
differ sufﬁciently. A typical characterisation of reliability
involves the mean and standard deviation (i.e., the vari-
ance, which is a measure of variability) of a travel time
distribution [19]. An example of such a travel time distri-
bution for one day is shown in the histogram in the bot-
tom part of Fig. 5.

Both ﬁrst- and second-order measures of a distribution
are by themselves insufﬁcient to capture the complete
picture.
In order to grasp the notion of the previously
mentioned safety margin, another typical statistical mea-
sure is considered, namely the 90th percentile. The ra-
tionale behind the use of this percentile is that travellers
adopt a certain ‘safe’ threshold with respect to their ex-
pected journey times. Considering the 90th percentile,
this means that only one out of ten times the experi-
enced travel time will differ signiﬁcantly from the ex-
pected travel time. Travel time reliability can thus be
viewed upon as a measure of service quality (similar to
the concept of ‘quality of service’ (QoS) in telecommu-
nications).

There has been some research into the analytic form of
travel time distributions (e.g., the work of Arroyo and
Kornhauser, concluding that a lognormal distribution
seems the most appropriate [4]). There exist however
signiﬁcant differences between travel time distributions:
in general, a smaller standard deviation indicates a better
service quality and reliability. In contrast to this, a large
standard deviation is indicative of chaotic behaviour
of the trafﬁc ﬂow,
the latter being totally unstable.
Furthermore, travel time distributions can have a long
tail; this signiﬁes seldom events (e.g., incidents), that can
have signiﬁcant repercussions on the quality of trafﬁc
operations.

Let us ﬁnally note that there is an increased inter-
est in the reliability of complete transportation net-
works, and their robustness against incidents. To
this end, Immers et al. consider reliability as a user-
oriented quality, whereas robustness is more a prop-
erty of the system itself [51]. Among several charac-
terising factors for robustness of transportation sys-
tems, they also introduce the following practical no-
tions in this context: redundancy, denoting a spare
capacity, and resilience, which is the ability to re-
peatedly recover from a temporary overload. Their
conclusion is that the key element in securing trans-
portation reliability lies in a good network design.

C. Level of service

Historically, one of the main performance indicators to
assess the quality of trafﬁc operations, was the level of
service (LOS), introduced in the 1960s. It is represented
as a grading system using one of six letters (A – F),
whereby LOS A denotes the best operating conditions
and LOS F the worst. These LOS measures are based
on road characteristics such as speed, travel time, . . . ,
and drivers’ perceptions of comfort, convenience, . . . [1].
As is customary among trafﬁc engineers, these represen-
tative statistics of these characteristics are collectively
called measures of effectiveness (MOE).

Levels A through D are representative for free-ﬂow con-
ditions whereby LOS A corresponds to free ﬂow, LOS B
to reasonable free ﬂow, LOS C to stable trafﬁc operations,
and LOS D to bordering unstable trafﬁc operations. LOS
E is reminiscent of near-capacity ﬂow conditions that are
extremely unstable, whereas LOS F corresponds to con-
gested ﬂow conditions (caused by either structural or in-
cidental congestion) [79].

As an example, we provide an overview of the differ-
ent levels of service in Table I (based on [79], in sim-
ilar form originally published in the Highway Capacity
Manual (HCM) of 1985 as the Transportation Research
Board’s (TRB)[127] special report #209.

(adapted from [79], in similar form originally published in the

Calculating levels of service can be done using a mul-
titude of methods; some examples include using the
density (at motorways), using the space-mean speed
(at arterial streets), using the delay (at signallised and

unsignallised intersections),

. . . [1].

between different LOS is primarily based on the mea-
sured average speed, and secondly on the density (or
occupancy). Furthermore, as traditional analyses only
focus on a select number of hours, a new trend is to con-
duct whole year analyses (WYA) based on aggregated
measurements such as e.g., the monthly average daily
trafﬁc (MADT) and the annual average daily trafﬁc
(AADT) [10]. The MADT is calculated as the average
amount of trafﬁc recorded during each day of the week,
averaged over all days within a month. Averaging the
resulting twelve MADTs gives the AADT.

Regarding the use of the LOS, we note that it is a
rather old-fashioned method for evaluating the qual-
In general, it is difﬁcult
ity of trafﬁc operations.
to calculate, mainly because the deﬁned standards
at which the different levels are set, always depend
on the speciﬁc type of trafﬁc situation that is studied
(e.g., type of road, . . . ). This makes the LOS more of
an engineering tool, used when assessing and plan-
ning operational analyses. Instead of using the LOS,
we therefore propose to adopt the more suited ap-
proach based on oblique cumulative plots (we refer
the reader to section III B 2). These allow for exam-
ple to assess the differences between travel times un-
der free-ﬂow and congested conditions, thereby giv-
ing a more meaningful and intuitive indication of the
quality of trafﬁc operations to the drivers.

D. Efﬁciency

In [18], Chen et al. state that the main reason for conges-
tion is not demand exceeding capacity (i.e., the number
of travellers who want to use a certain part of the trans-
portation network, exceeds the available infrastructure’s
capacity), but is in fact the inefﬁcient operation of motor-
ways during periods of high demand. In order to quan-
tify this efﬁciency, they ﬁrst look at what the prevailing
speed is when a motorway is operating at its maximum
efﬁciency, i.e., the highest ﬂow (corresponding to the ef-
fective capacity, which is different from the HCM’s ca-
pacity which is calculated from the road’s physical char-
acteristics). Based on the distribution of 5-minute data
samples from some 3300 detectors, they investigate the
speed during periods of very high ﬂows. This leads them
to a so-called sustained speed vsust = 60 miles per hour
(which corresponds to 60 mi/h × 1.609 ≈ 97 km/h).

The performance indicator they propose, is called the ef-
ﬁciency η and it based on the ratio of the total vehicle
miles travelled (VMT), divided by the total vehicle hours
travelled (VHT). Note that as the units of VMT and vsust
should correspond to each other, we propose to use the
terminology of total vehicle distance travelled (VDT) in-
stead of the VMT, in order to eliminate possible confu-
sion. Both VDT and VHT are deﬁned as follows:

with, as before, q the ﬂow, K the length of the road sec-
tion, and vs the space-mean speed. Using the above deﬁ-
nitions, we can write the efﬁciency of a road section as:

VDT = q K,

VHT =

VDT
vs

,

η =

VDT/VHT
vsust

.

(40)

(41)

(42)

The efﬁciency is expressed as a percentage, and it can
rise above 100% when the recorded average speeds sur-
pass the sustained speed vsust. In general, the discussed
efﬁciency can also easily be calculated for a complete
road network and an arbitrary time period.
It can
furthermore be seen as the ratio of the actual productivity
of a road section (the output produced by this section
during one hour), to its maximum possible production
(the input to the section) under high ﬂow conditions.

Note that as a solution to their original claim (“con-
gestion arises due to inefﬁcient operation”), Chen
et al. propose to increase the operational efﬁciency,
mainly through the technique of suitable ramp meter-
ing (using an idealised ramp metering control prac-
tice that maintains the occupancy downstream of an
on ramp to its critical level). But in our opinion,
they neglect to take into account the entire situa-
tion, i.e., they fail to consider the extra effects in-
duced by holding vehicles back at some on ramps
(e.g., the total time travelled by all the vehicles, in-
cluding delays), thus rendering their statement prac-
tically worthless by giving a feeble argument. Care-
ful examination of their reasoning, reveals that these
extra effects are dealt with by shifting demand during
the peak periods. . . but this just conﬁrms our hypoth-
esis that congestion occurs when demand exceeds
capacity, even when this capacity is for example con-
trolled through ramp metering !

In contrast to the work of Chen et al., Brilon proposes
another deﬁnition for the efﬁciency (now denoted as E):
it is expressed as the number of vehicle kilometres that
are produced by a motorway section per unit of time [10]:

E = q vs Tmp,

(43)

with now q the total ﬂow recorded during the time in-
terval Tmp. Brilon concludes that in order for motorways
to operate at maximum efﬁciency, their hourly ﬂows typi-
cally have to remain below the capacity ﬂow (e.g., at 90%
of qcap). Brilon also proposes to use this point of maxi-
mum efﬁciency as the threshold when going from LOS D
to LOS E.

V. FUNDAMENTAL DIAGRAMS

Whereas the previous sections dealt with individual traf-
ﬁc ﬂow characteristics, this section discusses some of the
relations between them. We ﬁrst give some characterisa-
tions of different trafﬁc ﬂow conditions and the rudimen-
tary transitions between them, followed by a discussion
of the relations (which are expressed as fundamental di-
agrams) between the trafﬁc ﬂow characteristics, giving
special attention to the different points of view adopted
by trafﬁc engineers.

A. Trafﬁc ﬂow regimes

Considering a stream of trafﬁc ﬂow, we can distin-
guish different types of operational characteristics, called
regimes (two other commonly used terms are trafﬁc ﬂow
phases and states). As each of these regimes is charac-
terised by a certain set of unique properties, classiﬁcation
of them is sometimes based on occupancy measurements
(see for example the discussion about levels of service in
section IV C), or it is based on combinations of different
macroscopic trafﬁc ﬂow characteristics (e.g., the work of
Kerner [55]).

In the following sections, we discuss the regimes known
as free-ﬂow trafﬁc, capacity-ﬂow trafﬁc, congested, stop-
and-go, and jammed trafﬁc. Our discussion of these
regimes is in fact based on the commonly adopted way
of looking at trafﬁc ﬂows, as opposed to for example
Kerner’s three-phase trafﬁc theory that includes a regime
known as synchronised trafﬁc (we refer the reader to sec-
tion V D for more details). We conclude the section with
a note on the transitions that occur from one regime to
another.

1. Free-ﬂow trafﬁc

Under light trafﬁc conditions, vehicles are able to freely
travel at their desired speed. As they are largely unim-
peded by other vehicles, drivers strive to attain their own
comfortable travelling speed (we assume that in case a
vehicle encounters a slower moving vehicle ahead, it can
easily change lanes in order to overtake the slower vehi-
cle). Notwithstanding this ability for unconstrained trav-
elling, drivers have to take into account the maximum al-
lowed speed (denoted by vmax), as well as road-, engine-,
and other vehicle characteristics. Note that in some cases,
depending on the country under scrutiny, drivers perform
speeding.

In essence, the previous description of free-ﬂow trafﬁc
considers a trafﬁc ﬂow to be unrestricted, i.e., no sig-
niﬁcant delays are introduced due to possible overtaking
manoeuvres. As a consequence, the free-ﬂow speed (by
some called the nominal speed) is the mean speed of all
vehicles, travelling at their own pace (e.g., 100 km/h); it
is denoted by vff.

Free-ﬂow trafﬁc occurs exclusively at low densities, im-
plying large average space headways according to equa-
tion (10). As a result, small local disturbances in the tem-
poral and spatial patterns of the trafﬁc stream have no
signiﬁcant effects, hence trafﬁc ﬂow is stable in the free-
ﬂow regime.

2. Capacity-ﬂow trafﬁc

When the trafﬁc density increases, vehicles are driving
closer to each other. Considering the number of vehicles
that pass a certain location alongside the road, an
observer will notice an increase in the ﬂow. At a certain
moment, the ﬂow will reach a maximum value (which is
determined by the mean speed of the trafﬁc stream and
the current density). This maximum ﬂow is called the
capacity ﬂow, denoted by qc, qcap, or even qmax. A typical
value for the capacity ﬂow on a three-lane Belgian
motorway with vmax equal to 120 km/h, can reach a
maximum of some 7000 vehicles [113]. According to
equation (17), the average time headway is minimal at
capacity-ﬂow trafﬁc, indicating the (local) formation of
tightly packed clusters of vehicles (i.e., platoons), which
are moving at a certain capacity-ﬂow speed vc (or vcap)
which is normally a bit lower than the free-ﬂow speed.
Note that some of these fast platoons are very unstable
when they are composed of tail-gating vehicles: when-
ever in such a string a vehicle slows down a little, it can
have a cascading effect, leading to exaggerate braking of
following vehicles. Hence, these latter manoeuvres can
destroy the local state of capacity-ﬂow, and can in the
worst case lead to multiple rear-end collisions. At this
point, trafﬁc becomes unstable.

The calculation of the capacity ﬂow is a daunting
task, holding trafﬁc engineers occupied for the last
six decades. The fact of the matter is that there ex-
ists no rigourous deﬁnition for the concept of ‘capac-
ity’. As a result, after many years of research, this
culminated in the publication of the fourth edition
of the already previously mentioned Highway Ca-
pacity Manual. It contains an impressive overview,
spanning methodologies for assessing the capacity at
speciﬁc types of road infrastructures (motorway fa-
cilities, weaving sections, on- and off-ramps, signal-
lised and unsignallised urban intersections, . . . ) [1].

3. Congested, stop-and-go, and jammed trafﬁc

Considering the regime of capacity-ﬂow trafﬁc, it is rea-
sonable to assume that drivers are more mentally aware
and alert in this regime, as they have to adapt their driving
style to the smaller space and time headways under high
speeds. However, when more vehicles are present, the
density is increased even further, allowing a sufﬁciently
large disturbance to take place. For example, a driver
with too small space and time headways, will have to
brake in order to avoid a collision with the leader directly

in front; this can lead to a local chain of reactions that
disrupts the trafﬁc stream and triggers a breakdown of the
ﬂow. The resulting state of saturated trafﬁc conditions, is
called congested trafﬁc. The moderately high density at
which this breakdown occurs, is called the critical den-
sity, and is denoted by kc or kcrit (for a typical motorway,
its value lies around 25 vehicles (PCUs) per kilometre
per lane, [113]). From this knowledge, we can derive
the optimal driving speed for single-lane trafﬁc ﬂows as
vs = qcap/kcrit = 2000 ÷ 25 =≈ 85 km/h.
Higher values for the density indicate almost always a
worsening of the trafﬁc conditions; congested trafﬁc can
result in stop-and-go trafﬁc, whereby vehicles encounter
so-called stop-and-go waves. These waves require them
to slow down severely, or even stop completely. When
trafﬁc becomes motionless, the space headway reaches a
minimum as all vehicles are standing bumper-to-bumper;
this extreme state is called jammed trafﬁc. Clearly, there
exists a maximum density at which the trafﬁc seems to
turn into a ‘parking lot’, called the jam density and it is
denoted by kj, kjam, or kmax. For a typical motorway, its
value lies around 140 vehicles (PCUs) per kilometre per
lane [113].

Note that the jam density is typically expressed in ve-
hicles per kilometre. As already stated in the intro-
duction of section III A, density ignores the effects
of trafﬁc composition and vehicle lengths. For a typ-
ical value of some 140 vehicles/km/lane for the jam
density, this means that we express the density by us-
ing passenger car units (see section III A 2 for more
details). Suppose now for example that an average
trailer truck equals 4.5 PCUs, then the jam density
would decrease to some 140 ÷ 4.5 ≈ 31 trucks for
this class of vehicles. As a consequence, the value of
the jam density is different for each vehicle class.

4. A note on the transitions between different regimes

Streams of trafﬁc ﬂows can be regarded as many-particle
systems (e.g., gasses, magnetic spin systems, . . . ); as
they have a large number of degrees of freedom, it is
often intractable when it comes to solving them exactly.
However, from a physical point of view, these systems
can be described in the framework of statistical physics,
whereby the collective behaviour of their constituents is
approximately treated using statistical techniques.

the changeover from one trafﬁc
Within this context,
regime to another, can be looked upon as a phase tran-
sition. Within thermodynamics and statistical physics, an
order parameter is often used to describe the phase tran-
sition: when the system shifts from one phase to another
(e.g., at a critical point for liquid-gas transitions), the or-
der parameter expresses a different qualitative behaviour.
Two examples of such an order parameter that is appli-
cable to trafﬁc ﬂows, can be found in Schadschneider et
al. who considered nearest neighbour correlations [104],
and in Jost and Nagel who devised a measure of inhomo-
geneity [53] (we refer the reader to our work in [78] for

an example in which they are used and compared when
tracking phase transitions).

There exists a difference in which a phase transition can
express itself. This difference is designated by the order
of the transition; generally speaking, the two most com-
mon phase transitions are ﬁrst-order and second-order
transitions. According to Ehrenfest’s classiﬁcation, ﬁrst-
order transitions have an abrupt, discontinuous change in
the order parameter that characterises the transition. In
contrast to this, the changeover to the new phase occurs
smoothly for second-order transitions [71, 119]. Note
that higher-order phase transitions also exist, e.g., in su-
perconducting materials [23].

With respect to the description of regimes in trafﬁc ﬂows,
it is commonly agreed that there exists a ﬁrst-order phase
transition when going from the capacity-ﬂow to the con-
gested regime. The point at which this transition occurs,
is the critical density. Studying the phase transitions en-
countered in ﬂuid dynamics, there exists a transition from
the laminar ﬂow (i.e., a ﬂuid ﬂowing in layers, each mov-
ing at a different velocity) to the turbulent ﬂow (i.e., the
disturbed random and unorganised state in which vortices
form). However, the transition here is triggered by an in-
crease in the velocity of the ﬂuid, as opposed to the tran-
sition in trafﬁc ﬂows where a change in the density can
lead to a cascading instability. In this respect, the anal-
ogy for trafﬁc ﬂows holds better when comparing them to
gas-liquid transitions. Here free-ﬂow trafﬁc corresponds
to a gaseous phase, in which particles are evenly spread
out in the system. At the point of the phase transition,
liquid droplets will form, coagulating together into big-
ger droplets. This leads to a state where both gaseous and
liquid phases coexist, typically in the form of a big liq-
uid droplet surrounded by gas particles. For even higher
densities, particles are so close to each other, and the only
remaining state is the liquid phase [37, 52, 53, 54, 68, 93].

In conclusion, we refer the reader to the work of Tamp`ere,
where an excellent overview is given, detailing the differ-
ent trafﬁc ﬂow regimes, their transitions, and mechanisms
with respect to jamming behaviour [108].

B. Correlations between trafﬁc ﬂow characteristics

Whereas the previous sections all treated the macroscopic
trafﬁc ﬂow characteristics on an individual basis, this sec-
tion considers some of the relations between them. We
start our discussion with a look at the historic origin of
fundamental diagrams, after which we shed some light on
the different classical approaches. The section concludes
with some considerations with respect to empirical mea-
surements.

1. The historic origin of the fundamental diagram

As in many scientiﬁc disciplines, the resulting statements
and theories are often preceded by an investigation of ob-
tained experimental data, which serves as empirical ev-

idence for them. In this line of reasoning, Greenshields
was among the ﬁrst to provide — as far back as 1935 —
a basis for most of the classic work on, what are called,
empirical fundamental diagrams. In his seminal paper,
he sketched a linear relation between the density and the
mean speed, based on empirically obtained data [44]:

v = vff

1 −

(cid:18)

k
kj (cid:19)

.

(44)

As can be seen from Greenshields’ relation, when
increasing the density from zero to the jam density kj,
the mean speed will monotonically decrease from the
free-ﬂow speed vff to zero (note that we dropped the ‘s’
or ‘t’ subscript from the mean speed, as it is not sure
whether or not Greenshields used space- or time-mean
speed, respectively). The relation can be understood
intuitively, by assuming that drivers will tend to slow
down in crowded trafﬁc, because this naturally gives
them more time to react to changes (e.g., sudden braking
of the lead vehicle). As it is reasonable to assume that the
mean speed remains unaffected for very low densities,
Greenshields furthermore ﬂattened the upper-left part
of the regression line (corresponding to the free-ﬂow
speed), although this effect is not incorporated in equa-
tion (44).

FIG. 6: Greenshields’ original linear relation between the den-
sity and the mean speed. Note that the regression line is based
on only seven measurements points, and that artiﬁcial ﬂattening
of its upper-left part (ﬁgure based on [72] and [39]).

Although Greenshields’ derivation of the linear relation
between density and space-mean speed appears elegant
and simple, it should nevertheless be taken with a grain
of salt. The fact of the matter is that his hypothesis is, as
can be seen in Fig. 6, based on only seven measurement
points, which comprise aerial observations taken on
September 3rd (Monday, Labor Day), 1934 [79]. One of
the problems is that these observations are not indepen-
dent. An even more serious problem is that six of these
observations were obtained for free-ﬂow conditions,
whereas the one single point that indicates congested

conditions, was obtained at an entirely different road, on
a different day [39] !

Some twenty years later, Lighthill and Whitham devel-
oped a theory that describes the trafﬁc ﬂows on long
crowded roads using a ﬁrst-order ﬂuid-dynamic model
[72]. As one of the main ingredients in their theory, they
postulated the following fundamental hypothesis: “at any
point of the road, the ﬂow q is a function of the den-
sity k”. They called this function the ﬂow-concentration
curve (recall from section III C that density in the past got
sometimes referred to as concentration).

Continuing their reasoning, Lighthill and Whitham then
referred to Greenshields’ earlier work, relating the space-
mean speed to the density, and, by means of equation
(31), thus relating the ﬂow to the density. The existence
of the concept of the ﬂow-concentration curve mentioned
above, was justiﬁed on the grounds that it describes traf-
ﬁc operating under steady-state conditions, i.e., homoge-
neous and stationary trafﬁc as explained in section III D 2.
In this context, the ﬂow-concentration curve therefore de-
scribes the average characteristics of a trafﬁc ﬂow. So
Greenshields ﬁrst ﬁtted a regression line to scarce data,
after which his functional form seemed to be taken for
granted for the following seventy years. The key aspect
in Lighthill and Whitham’s (and also Richards’ [102])
approach, lay in the fact that they broadened the ﬂow-
concentration curve’s validity, including also conditions
of non-stationary trafﬁc. They also stated that, because
of e.g., changes in the trafﬁc composition, the curve can
vary from day to day, or even within a day (e.g., rush
hours, . . . ). The same statement holds also true when
considering the ﬂow-concentration curves of different ve-
hicle classes (e.g., cars and trucks).

The term fundamental diagram itself,
is historically
based on Lighthill and Whitham’s fundamental hy-
pothesis of the existence of such a one-dimensional
ﬂow-concentration curve. As trafﬁc engineers grew
accustomed to the graphical representation of this curve,
they started talking about the diagram that represents it,
i.e., the ’fundamental diagram’ [45].

In its original form, the fundamental diagram repre-
sents an equilibrium relation between ﬂow and den-
sity, denoted by qe(k). But note that, because of the
fundamental relation of trafﬁc ﬂow theory (see sec-
tion III D 2), is it equally justiﬁed to talk about the
vse (k) or the vse (q) fundamental diagrams. Due
to this equilibrium property, the trafﬁc states (i.e.,
the density, ﬂow, and space-mean speed) can be
thought of as ‘moving’ over the fundamental dia-
grams’ curves.

2. The general shape of a fundamental diagram

We now give an overview of some of the qualitative
features of the different possible fundamental diagrams,
representing the equilibrium relations between density,

space-mean speed, and average space headway, and ﬂow.
Note that in each example, we consider a possible fun-
damental diagram, as they can take on many (functional)
shapes.

Space-mean speed versus density
We start our discussion based on the equilibrium relation
between space-mean speed and density, i.e., the vse (k)
fundamental diagram. The main reason for starting here,
is the fact that this diagram is the easiest to understand in-
tuitively. Complementary to the example of Greenshields
in Fig. 6, we give a small overview of its most prominent
features:

• the density is restricted between 0 and the maxi-

mum density, i.e., the jam density kj ,

• the space-mean speed is restricted between 0 and
the maximum average speed, i.e., the free-ﬂow
speed vff,

• as density increases, the space-mean speed mono-

tonically decreases,

• there exists a small range of low densities, in which
the space-mean speed remains unaffected and cor-
responds more or less to the free-ﬂow speed,

• and ﬁnally, the ﬂow (equal to density times space-
mean speed), can be derived as the area demarcated
by a rectangle who’s lower-left and upper-right cor-
ners are the origin and a point on the fundamental
diagram, respectively.

jam density is reached (i.e., all vehicles are stand-
ing nearly bumper to bumper),

• as the average space headway increases, its inverse
(the density) decreases, and the space-mean speed
increases,

• the space-mean speed continues to rise with an in-
creasing average space headway, until it reaches
the maximum average speed, i.e., the free-ﬂow
speed vff; this happens at the inverse of the criti-
cal density k−1
c ,

• from then on, the space-mean speed remains con-

stant with increasing average space headway.

The above features can be understood intuitively: at
large average space headways, a driver experiences no
inﬂuence from its direct frontal leader. However, there
exists a point at which the driver comes ‘close enough’ to
this leader (i.e., in crowded trafﬁc), so that its speed will
decrease. This slowing down will continue to persist as
trafﬁc gets more dense (this the same reasoning behind
Greenshields’ derivation in section V B 1).

Flow versus density
Probably the most encountered form of a fundamental di-
agram, is that of ﬂow versus density. Its origins date back
to the seminal work of Lighthill and Whitham who, as
described earlier, referred to it as the ﬂow-concentration
curve. An example of the qe(k) fundamental diagram is
depicted in Fig. 8.

Space-mean speed versus average space headway
Microscopic and macroscopic trafﬁc ﬂow characteristics
are related to each other by means of equations (10) and
(17). According to the former, density k is inversely pro-
portional to the average space headway hs. We can there-
fore derive a fundamental diagram, similar to the pre-
vious one, by substituting the density with the average
space headway. As as result, the abscissa gets ‘inverted’,
resulting in the fundamental diagram as shown in Fig. 7.

FIG. 7: A fundamental diagram relating the average space

age space headway is proportional to the inverse of the density,
i.e., k−1.

The interesting features of this type of fundamental dia-
gram, can be summed as follows:

• the curve starts not in the origin, but at k−1

sponding to the average space headway when the

FIG. 8: A fundamental diagram relating the density k to the

kc. The space-mean speed vs for any point on the curve, is
deﬁned as the slope of the line through that point and the origin.
Taking the slope of the tangent to points on the curve, gives the
characteristic wave speed w.

Noteworthy features of this type of fundamental diagram
are:

• for moderately low densities (i.e., below the crit-
ical density kc), the ﬂow increases more or less
linearly (this is called the free-ﬂow branch of the
fundamental diagram),

• near the critical density kc, the fundamental dia-
gram can bend slightly, due to faster vehicles being
obstructed by slower vehicles, thereby lowering the
free-ﬂow speed [97],

• at the critical density kc, the ﬂow reaches a maxi-

mum, called the capacity ﬂow[128] qcap,

• in the congested regime (i.e., for densities higher
than the critical density), the ﬂow starts to degrade
with increasing density, until the jam density kj is
reached and trafﬁc comes to a stand still, resulting
in a zero ﬂow (this is called the congested branch
of the fundamental diagram),

• the space-mean speed vs for any point on the qe(k)
fundamental diagram, can be found as the slope of
the line through that point and the origin,

There is one more piece of information revealed by the
qe(k) fundamental diagram: When taking the slope of
the tangent in any point of the diagram, we obtain what
is called the kinematic wave speed. These speeds w cor-
respond to shock waves encountered in trafﬁc ﬂows (e.g.,
the stop-and-go waves). As can be seen from the ﬁg-
ure, the shock waves travel forwards, i.e., downstream, in
free-ﬂow trafﬁc (w ≥ 0), but backwards, i.e., upstream,
in congested trafﬁc (w ≤ 0).

The above shape of the qe(k) fundamental diagram is
just one possibility. There exist many different ﬂavours,
originally derived by trafﬁc engineers seeking a better
ﬁt of these curves to empirical data. After the work of
Greenshields, another functional form — based on a log-
arithm — was proposed by Greenberg [43]. Another
possible form was introduced by Underwood [112]. All
of the previous diagrams are called single-regime mod-
els, because they formulate only one relation between
the macroscopic trafﬁc ﬂow characteristics for the entire
range of densities (i.e., trafﬁc ﬂow regimes) [79]. In con-
trast to this, Edie started developing multi-regime mod-
els, allowing for discontinuities and a better ﬁt to empir-
ical data coming from different trafﬁc ﬂow regimes [35].
We refer the reader to the work of Drake et al. [34] and
the book of May [79] for an extensive comparison and
overview of these different modelling approaches (note
that Drake et al. used time-mean speed).

During the last two decades, other, sometimes more so-
phisticated, functional relationships between density and
ﬂow have been proposed. Examples are the work of
Smulders who created a non-differentiable point at the
critical density in a two-regime fundamental diagram
[106], the METANET model of Messmer and Papageor-
giou who’s single-regime fundamental diagram contains
an inﬂection point near the jam density [80], the work
of De Romph who generalised Smulders’ functional de-
scription of his two-regime fundamental diagram [103],
the typical triangular shape of the fundamental diagram
introduced by Newell, resulting in only two possible val-
ues for the kinematic wave speed w [97],
. . . As can
be seen, these fundamental diagrams sometimes take on
non-concave forms, depending on the existence of in-
ﬂection points in the functional relation between ﬂow

and density.
In general, they can be convex, concave,
(dis)continuous, piecewise-linear, everywhere differen-
tiable, have inﬂection points, . . . Variations in shape will
continu to be proposed, as it is for certain that there is
no general consensus among trafﬁc engineers regarding
the correct shape of this fundamental diagram. To illus-
trate this, a more exotic approach is based on catastrophe
theory, which is, in a sense, a three-dimensional model
that jointly treats density, ﬂow, and space-mean speed.
Acha-Daza and Hall applied the technique, resulting in a
satisfactory ﬁt with empirical data [2].

The most extreme argument with respect to the shape
of the fundamental diagram, came from Kerner who
questioned its validity, and consequently rejected it alto-
gether by replacing it with his fundamental hypothesis of
three-phase trafﬁc ﬂow theory (refer to section V D for
more details) [55].

Space-mean speed versus ﬂow
An often spotted shape is that of the vse(q) fundamental
diagram, depicted in Fig. 9. As opposed to the earlier
discussed vse (k) fundamental diagram, the space-mean
speed versus ﬂow curve no longer embodies a function in
the strict mathematical sense: for each value of the ﬂow,
there exists two different mean speeds, namely one in the
free-ﬂow regime (upper branch) and one in the congested
regime (lower branch).

FIG. 9: A fundamental diagram relating the ﬂow q to the space-
mean speed vs. The capacity ﬂow qcap is located at the right
edge of the diagram, i.e., it is deﬁned as the maximum average
ﬂow. Note that there are two possible speeds associated with
each value of the ﬂow.

Some people, e.g., economists who use the ﬂow to rep-
resent trafﬁc demand, ﬁnd this kind of fundamental dia-
gram easy to cope with. But in our opinion, we are con-
vinced however, that this diagram is rather difﬁcult to un-
derstand at ﬁrst sight. We believe the vse(k) fundamental
diagram is a much better candidate, because density can
intuitively be understood as a measure for how crowded
trafﬁc is, as opposed to some ﬂow giving rise to two dif-
ferent values for the space-mean speed.

As a ﬁnal comment, we would like to point out that the
previously discussed bivariate functional relationships
between the trafﬁc ﬂow characteristics (e.g., density and
ﬂow), are based on observations. More importantly, this

means that there is no direct causal relation assumed be-
tween any two variables. Fundamental diagrams sketch
only possible correlations, implying that the nature of the
transitions between different trafﬁc regimes thus remains
to be explored (see section V A 4 for a discussion).

3. Empirical measurements

the fundamental diagrams dis-
As mentioned earlier,
cussed in the previous section represent equilibrium re-
lations between the macroscopic trafﬁc ﬂow characteris-
tics of section III. In sharp contrast to this, real empiri-
cal measurements from detector stations do not describe
such nice one-dimensional curves corresponding to the
functional relationships.

As an illustrative example, we provide some scatter plots
in Fig. 10. The shown data comprises detector measure-
ments (the sampling interval was one minute) during the
entire year 2003; they were obtained by means of a video
camera [113] located at the E17 three-lane motorway
near Linkeroever[129], Belgium. Because of the nature
of this data, we only obtained ﬂows, occupancies, and
time-mean speeds. After calculating the average vehicle
length, the occupancies were converted into densities us-
ing equation (22). Using these recorded time series, we
then constructed scatter plots of the density, time-mean
speed, ﬂow, and average space headway. Note that no
substantial changes are introduced in these plots due to
e.g., our using of densities calculated from occupancies,
instead of using real measured densities.

FIG. 10: Illustrative scatter plots of the relations between trafﬁc
ﬂow characteristics as measured by video camera CLO3 located
at the E17 three-lane motorway near Linkeroever, Belgium. The
measured occupancies were converted into densities, the time-
mean speed remained unchanged. Shown are scatter plots of a
(k,vt) diagram (top-left), a (hs,vt) diagram (top-right), a (k,q)
diagram (bottom-left), and a (q,vt) diagram (bottom-right).

As the dimension of time is removed in these scatter
plots, Daganzo calls them time-independent models [27].
It is important to understand that these scatter plots are
not fundamental diagrams, because the latter represent

one-dimensional equilibrium curves. According to Hel-
bing, a better designation would be regression models
In this dissertation, we introduce a terminology
[47].
based on phase spaces (or equivalently state spaces), re-
sulting in e.g., the (k,q) diagram (note that we dropped
the adjective ‘fundamental’).

In reality, trafﬁc is not homogeneous, nor is it stationary,
thus having the effect of a large amount of scatter in
the presented diagrams. In free-ﬂow trafﬁc, interactions
between vehicles are rare, and their small local distur-
bances have no signiﬁcant effects on the trafﬁc stream.
As a result, all points are somewhat densely concentrated
along a line — representing the free-ﬂow speed — in
all four diagrams. However, in the congested regime,
a wide range of scatter is visible due to the interactions
between vehicles. Furthermore, vehicle accelerations
and decelerations lead to large ﬂuctuations in the trafﬁc
stream, as can be seen by the thin, but large, cloud of
data points. The effect is especially pronounced for
intermediate densities, leading to large ﬂuctuations in the
time-mean speed and ﬂow.

The occurrence of all this scatter in the data, leads
some trafﬁc engineers to question the validity of
the fundamental diagram. More speciﬁcally, the
behaviour in congested trafﬁc seems ill-deﬁned to
some. As stated earlier, Kerner is the most in-
tense opponent in this debate, as he outright rejects
Lighthill and Whitham’s hypothesis that remained
popular over the last ﬁfty years. Despite this criti-
cism, the fundamental diagram remains, to the ma-
jority of the community, a fairly accurate description
of the average behaviour of a trafﬁc stream. Cas-
sidy even provided quantiﬁable evidence of the ex-
istence of well-deﬁned bivariate relations between
trafﬁc ﬂow characteristics. The key here was to sep-
arate stationary periods from non-stationary ones in
the detector data (i.e., stratifying it) [14, 27]. Prior
work of Del Castillo and Ben´itez resulted in a more
mathematically justiﬁed method, for ﬁtting empiri-
cal curves in data regions of stationary trafﬁc, after
construction of a rigid set of properties that all fun-
damental diagrams should satisfy [31, 32].

As a ﬁnal note, we remark that the distribution of the
cloud-like data points of the diagrams in Fig. 10, is a re-
sult of various kinds of phenomena. First and foremost,
there is the heterogeneity in the trafﬁc composition (fast
passenger cars, slow trailer trucks, . . . ). Secondly, as al-
ready mentioned, the non-stationary behaviour of trafﬁc
introduces a signiﬁcant amount of scatter in the congested
regime. Thirdly, each scatter plot is dependent on the type
of road, and the time of day at which the measurements
were collected. In this respect, the inﬂuence of (chang-
ing) weather conditions is not to be underestimated (e.g.,
rain fall results in different diagrams). In conclusion, it
is clear that if we want these scatter plots to better ﬁt the
fundamental diagrams, all data points should be collected
under similar conditions. Even more so, the relative lo-
cation on the road at which the data points were recorded
plays a signiﬁcant role: e.g., a jam that propagates up-
stream, passing an on-ramp will show different effects,

depending on where the observations were gathered (up-
stream, right at, or downstream of the on-ramp) and on
whether or not the particular bottleneck was active [79].

C. Capacity drop and the hysteresis phenomenon

In the early sixties, trafﬁc engineers frequently observed a
discontinuity in the measurements near the capacity ﬂow.
To this end, Edie proposed a two-regime model that in-
cluded such a discontinuity at the critical density [35].
Nowadays, this typical form of the qe(k) fundamental di-
agram is known as a reversed lambda shape (the name
was originally suggested by Koshi et al. [67]).

An example of such a reversed λ fundamental diagram,
is shown in the left part of Fig. 11. Note however, that
the depicted discontinuity apparently leads to overlap-
ping branches of the free-ﬂow and congested regimes, re-
sulting in a multi-valued fundamental diagram.

FIG. 11: Left: the typical inverted λ shape of the (k,q) funda-
mental diagram, showing a capacity drop from qcap to below
qout ≪ qcap (i.e., the queue discharge ﬂow). The hysteresis
effect occurs when going from the congested to the free-ﬂow
branch, as indicated by the three arrows (1) – (3). Right: a
(k,q) diagram based on empirical data of one day, obtained by
video camera CLO3, at the E17 three-lane motorway near Link-
eroever, Belgium. The black dots denote minute measurements,
whereas the thick solid line represents the time-traced evolution
of trafﬁc conditions. The observed hysteresis loop was based
on consecutive 5-minute intervals covering a period that encom-
passes the morning rush hour between 06:30 and 09:30.

Considering the left part of Fig. 11, it appears the ﬂow
can take on two different values (hence the name ‘two-
regime, two-capacity’ model) depending on the trafﬁc
conditions, i.e., whether trafﬁc is moving from the free-
ﬂow to the congested regime on the equilibrium curve or
vice versa. In order to comprehensively understand this
hysteretic behaviour, we consider the following intuitive
sequence of events:

(1) In the free-ﬂow regime, the ﬂow steadily
rises with increasing density, small perturba-
tions in the trafﬁc ﬂow have no signiﬁcant
effects (see section V A 1).
(2) At the critical density kc, trafﬁc is said to
be metastable: for small disturbances, traf-
ﬁc is stable, but when these disturbances are
sufﬁciently large, they can lead to a cascad-
ing effect (see section V A 2), resulting in a
breakdown of trafﬁc and kicking it onto the
congested branch. The state of capacity ﬂow

at qcap is destroyed, due to a sudden decrease
of the ﬂow, called the capacity drop.
(3) In order to recover from the congested
to the free-ﬂow regime, the trafﬁc density
has to be reduced substantially (in compari-
son with the reverse transition), i.e., well be-
low the critical density kc. After this recov-
ery, the ﬂow will not be equal to qcap, but to
qout ≪ qcap, which is called the outﬂow from
a jam or the queue discharge capacity.

The above sequence signiﬁes a hysteresis loop in the ﬂow
versus density fundamental diagram: going from the free-
ﬂow to the congested regime occurs via the capacity ﬂow,
but the reverse transition proceeds via another way. The
phenomenon was ﬁrst observed by Treiterer and Meyers,
who used aerial photography to calculate densities and
space-mean speeds, extracted from a platoon of moving
vehicles [110]. Hall et al. later observed a similar phe-
nomenon [46].

The right part of Fig. 11 shows a (k,q) diagram, obtained
with empirical data collected at Monday September 10th,
2001. The data was recorded by video camera CLO3,
at the E17 three-lane motorway near Linkeroever, Bel-
gium. The small dots represent minute-based measure-
ments, whereas the thick solid line represents the time-
traced evolution of trafﬁc conditions. The observed hys-
teresis loop was based on consecutive 5-minute inter-
vals covering a period that encompasses the morning rush
hour between 06:30 and 09:30.

Zhang is among the few who try to give a possible
rigourous mathematical explanation for the occurrence
of this hysteresis phenomenon [120]. His exposition is
based on the behaviour of individual drivers during car-
following: central to his interpretation is the existence of
an asymmetry between accelerating and decelerating ve-
hicles (a related notion was already explored by Newell
back in 1963 [94]). The former are associated with larger
space headways, whereas the latter typically have smaller
space headways. Both observations can be understood
when considering the characteristic ‘harmonica’ effect of
a string of consecutive vehicles: when the next stop-and-
go wave is encountered, a driver is more alert as he typ-
ically has to brake rather hard in order to avoid a colli-
sion. But once this wave has passed, a driver gets more
relaxed, resulting in a larger response time when apply-
ing the gas pedal. The deceleration reaction leads to a
sudden decrease of the space headway, whereas the ac-
celeration reaction leads to a gradually developing larger
space headway. To this end, Zhang introduces three dis-
tinct trafﬁc phases, respectively called the acceleration
phase, the deceleration phase, and a strong equilibrium
(indicating a constant speed). Because the space head-
way is thus treated differently under these qualitatively
different circumstances, the result is that there are now
different functional relations for the vse (hs) fundamental
diagram. As a consequence, a hysteresis loop can appear
in the (density,ﬂow) state space. Note that Zhang’s work
describes a continuous loop in state space, whereas in
most cases hysteresis is assumed to follow a discontinu-
ous fundamental diagram. Furthermore, as there are three

different ways for vehicles to reside in a trafﬁc stream
(i.e., Zhang’s trafﬁc phases), there are now three different
capacities related to these conditions; it is the capacity
under a stationary equilibrium ﬂow that should be con-
sidered as the ideal capacity of a roadway [121].

Note that depending on the location where the traf-
ﬁc stream measurements were performed, the transition
from the free-ﬂow to the congested regime and vice versa
does not always have to pass via the capacity ﬂow. In-
stead, observations can indicate that the trafﬁc state can
jump abruptly from one branch to another in the diagram
[39]. A possible explanation is that upstream of a jam,
vehicles arrive with high speeds, resulting in strong de-
celerations; a detector station located at this point would
observe trafﬁc jumping from the uncongested branch im-
mediately to the congested branch, without necessarily
having to pass via the capacity [95]. This has led Hall et
al. to believe the reversed lambda shape is more correctly
replaced by a continuous but non-differentiable inverted
V shape [46].

Continuing this latter train of thought, Daganzo believes
that many of these ‘extravagant’ phenomena (e.g., a
multi-valued fundamental diagram) are uncalled for.
Applying the stratiﬁcation methodology of Cassidy [14],
the scatter in the empirical data may vanish, restoring a
smooth continuous equilibrium relation between density
and ﬂow. One way of explaining the high tip of the
lambda,
is to assume that it is caused by statistical
ﬂuctuations that comprise platoons of densely packed
vehicles [27].

there has been a
During the last seventy years,
continuing quest to ﬁnd the ‘correct’ form of the
fundamental diagrams.
In this respect, we like to
stress the fact that ‘only looking at the measure-
trafﬁc engineers wanting
ments’ is not sufﬁcient:
to mine the gigabytes of empirical data, should
always look at the global picture. This means that
the typical driving patterns, as well as the local
geometry/infrastructure, should also be taken into
account, so that the local measurements can be
interpreted with respect to the trafﬁc ﬂow dynamics.
If this is neglected, the danger exists that trafﬁc is
only sampled at discrete locations, giving a sort
of ‘truncated’ view of the occurring dynamical
processes.

Finally, we like to agree with Zhang’s comments:
the root cause of most of the differences in the con-
struction of fundamental diagrams, is the erroneous
treatment of data (e.g., mixing data stemming from
different trafﬁc ﬂow regimes) [120]. Because fun-
damental diagrams imply the notion of an equilib-
rium, care should be taken when using the data, i.e.,
only considering stationary periods after removing
the transients.

D. Kerner’s three-phase theory

In the mid-nineties, Kerner and other fellow researchers,
studied various trafﬁc ﬂow measurements stemming from
detector stations along German motorways.
Initially,
they agreed with the classic notion of Lighthill and
Whitham’s fundamental hypothesis of the existence of
one-dimensional equilibrium relation between the macro-
scopic trafﬁc ﬂow characteristics (see section V B 1 for
more details). However, upon discovery of a rich and
complex set of empirical tempo-spatial patterns in con-
gested trafﬁc ﬂow, Kerner decided to abolish this hypoth-
esis, as it could not adequately capture all of these ob-
served patterns. As a consequence, Kerner rejects all
trafﬁc ﬂow theories and models that are based on this one-
dimensional equilibrium relation [55].

In the search for a more correct theory that could accu-
rately describe empirical trafﬁc ﬂow observations, Kerner
developed what is known as the three-phase theory of
trafﬁc ﬂow.

1. Free ﬂow, synchronised ﬂow, and wide-moving jam

In section V A, we elaborated on a classic approach to
trafﬁc ﬂow, general assuming two qualitatively different
regimes, namely free-ﬂow and congested trafﬁc. Based
on empirical ﬁndings, Kerner and Rehborn in 1996 pro-
posed three different regimes, separating the congested
regime into two other regimes. This led them to the in-
troduction of the following regimes [61]:

• free ﬂow,

• synchronised ﬂow,

• and wide-moving jam.

The main difference between synchronised ﬂow and the
wide-moving jam, is that in the former low speeds but
high ﬂows (comparable to free-ﬂow trafﬁc) can be ob-
served, whereas in the latter both low speeds and low
ﬂows are observed. The description by the term ‘synchro-
nised’ was based on the discovery that the time series of
ﬂows, densities, and mean speeds exhibited large degrees
of correlation among neighbouring lanes. And although
synchronised ﬂow is treated as a form of congestion, it
nevertheless is characterised by a high continuous ﬂow.
Furthermore, a typical tempo-spatial region of synchro-
nised ﬂow has a ﬁxed downstream front (that could be
located at a bottleneck’s position), whereas both the up-
stream and downstream fronts of a wide-moving jam can
propagate undisturbed in the upstream direction of a traf-
ﬁc stream [60].

Kerner distinguishes several congestion patterns with
respect to trafﬁc ﬂows. A ﬁrst typical pattern is a
synchronised-ﬂow pattern (SP), which can be further
classiﬁed as a moving SP (MSP), a widening SP (WSP),
and a localised SP (LSP). An SP can only contain syn-
chronised ﬂow; as we will shortly mention in section

V D 3, a moving jam can only occur inside such an SP.
When such a jam transforms into a wide-moving jam,
the resulting pattern is called a general pattern (GP); a
GP therefore contains both synchronised ﬂow and wide-
moving jams. Just as with the SP, there exist different
types of GP. These are a dissolving GP (DGP), a GP un-
der weak congestion, and a GP under strong congestion.
A ﬁnal often encountered pattern occurs when two bottle-
necks are spatially close to each other, resulting in what
is called an expanded congested pattern (EP).

Taking the above considerations into account, the discov-
ery and distinction between both types of congested traf-
ﬁc patterns should be made on the basis of tempo-spatial
plots of the speed, rather than the ﬂow (because the ﬂow
in synchronised trafﬁc is difﬁcult to differentiate from
that of free-ﬂow trafﬁc) [55]. To this end, Kerner et al.
developed two applications that are capable of accurately
estimating, automatically tracking, and reliably predict-
ing the above mentioned congested trafﬁc patterns. Their
models are the Forecasting of Trafﬁc Objects (FOTO) and
Automatische StauDynamikAnalyse (ASDA) [63].

2. Fundamental hypothesis of three-phase trafﬁc theory

Central to Kerner’s theory, is the fundamental hypothesis
of three-phase trafﬁc theory, which basically states that
hypothetical steady states of synchronised ﬂow, cover a
two-dimensional region in a ﬂow versus density diagram
(as opposed to the classic notion of a one-dimensional
equilibrium relation). An example of such a diagram can
be seen in Fig. 12.

FIG. 12: The ﬂow versus density relation according to Kerner’s
three-phase trafﬁc theory. The curve of free ﬂow (denoted by F )
is reminiscent of observations in the classic free-ﬂow regime. It
levels of a bit towards the capacity ﬂow qcap at the critical den-
sity kc. As a result of Kerner’s fundamental hypothesis, the
region of synchronised ﬂow (denoted by S) covers a large two-
dimensional part of the density-ﬂow phase space.
It is inter-
sected by the line J, denoting the steady propagation of wide-
moving jams. The line J also intersects the curve of free ﬂow
in the outﬂow from a jam qout ≪ qcap at the associated density
kout.

In the ﬂow versus density diagram in Fig. 12, the three
regimes are depicted: the curve of free ﬂow (denoted by
F ), the region of synchronised ﬂow (denoted by S) and

the wide-moving jam (denoted by the empirical line J).
Just as in the classic fundamental diagrams, the observa-
tions in free-ﬂow trafﬁc lie on a sharp line that linearly
increases the ﬂow with higher densities (note the level-
ling of the curve near the capacity ﬂow qcap associated
with the critical density kc). The region of synchronised
ﬂow spans a large part of the density-ﬂow phase space;
an important remark here is that consecutive measure-
ment points are scattered within this region, meaning that
an increase in the ﬂow can happen with both higher and
lower densities (as opposed to the free-ﬂow regime) [61].

The characteristic line J denotes the steady, undisturbed
propagation of wide-moving jams. Its slope corresponds
to the speed of a wide-moving jam’s downstream front,
which typically lies around w ≈ -15 km/h [60]. The
upper-left point of the line J is located at a density kout
corresponding to the outﬂow qout ≪ qcap from a wide-
moving jam. This is an illustration of the capacity drop
phenomenon, elucidated in section V C. The line J is
deﬁned as follows:

q(k) =

1 −

T

(cid:18)

k

,

(45)

with T the time gap in congested trafﬁc ﬂows; it is used
to tune the outﬂow from a jam. Because wide-moving
jams travel undisturbed, their outﬂow — caused by vehi-
cles that leave the downstream front — can be either free
ﬂow or synchronised ﬂow. Typical values for this outﬂow
range from 1500 to 2000 vehicles/hour/lane [55]. The av-
erage ﬂow rate within such a wide-moving jam can be al-
most zero, meaning that vehicles continuously encounter
stop-and-go waves.

Related to the wild scatter in the (k,q) diagram of three-
phase trafﬁc theory, is the microscopic behaviour of in-
dividual vehicles. The explanation given by Kerner and
Klenov, is that vehicles in synchronised ﬂow do not as-
sume a ﬁxed preferred distance to their direct frontal
leader, but rather accept a certain range of distances.
Within this range, drivers have both the tendency to over-
accelerate when they think there is the ability to overtake,
and the tendency for drivers to adjust their speed to that
of their leader, when this overtaking can not be fulﬁlled
[55, 58].

3. Transitions towards a wide-moving jam

The breakdown of trafﬁc from the free-ﬂow to the wide-
moving jam state, is nearly always characterised by two
successive F → S and S → J transitions, between free
ﬂow and synchronised ﬂow, and synchronised ﬂow and
wide-moving jam respectively. In the ﬁrst stage, a state
of free ﬂow changes to synchronised ﬂow by the F → S
transition. Central to the idea of this phase transition, is
the fact that there is no explicit need for an external dis-
turbance for its occurrence. A sufﬁciently large (i.e., su-
percritical) internal disturbance inside the trafﬁc stream

(e.g., a lane change) causes a nucleation effect that in-
stigates the F → S transition. Once it has set in, the
onset of congestion is accompanied by a sharp drop in
the mean vehicle speed. During the second stage, a set of
narrow-moving jams can grow inside the tempo-spatial
region of synchronised ﬂow. A narrow-moving jam is
different from a wide-moving jam, in that vehicles typi-
cally do not on average come to a full stop inside the jam.
But, due to a compression of synchronised ﬂow (an ef-
fect termed the pinch effect), these narrow-moving jams
can coalesce into a wide-moving jam, thereby complet-
ing the cascade of the F → S → J transition, resulting
in stop-and-go trafﬁc [57].

With respect
to the ﬂow versus density diagram in
Fig. 12, it can be seen that the line J actually divides
the region of synchronised ﬂow in two parts. Points that
lie underneath this line, characterise stable trafﬁc states
where no S → J transition can occur. Points above
the line J however, characterise metastable trafﬁc states,
meaning that sufﬁciently large disturbances can trigger a
S → J transition [55, 66].

Note that the direct F → J transition between free ﬂow
and wide-moving jam can also occur, but it has a very
small probability, i.e., the critical perturbation needed, is
much higher than that of the frequently occurring F → S
transition between free ﬂow and synchronised ﬂow. So in
general, wide-moving jams do not emerge spontaneously
in free ﬂow, but a situation where such a transition may
occur, is when an off-ramp gets ﬁlled with slow-moving
vehicles. This results in a local obstruction at the motor-
way’s lane directly adjacent to the off-ramp, which can
cause a local breakdown of the upstream trafﬁc, resulting
in a wide-moving jam. Finally, it is important to distin-
guish the nature of this transition from that of the F → S
transition: the former is a transition induced by an exter-
nal disturbance of the local trafﬁc ﬂow, whereas the latter
is considered as a spontaneous transition due to an inter-
nal disturbance within the local trafﬁc ﬂow (e.g., a lane
change) [55].

4. From descriptions to simulations

As Kerner himself describes his three-phase theory, it
is a qualitative theory.
In essence, it gives no expla-
nation of why certain transitions occur, as it only de-
scribes them [55]. However, several exemplary micro-
scopic trafﬁc ﬂow models have already been developed
(i.e., treating all vehicles and their interactions individu-
ally). These models can reproduce the different empirical
tempo-spatial patterns described by Kerner’s theory. As
examples, we mention two models based on cellular au-
tomata: a ﬁrst attempt was made by Knospe et al., who
developed a model that takes into account a driver’s re-
action to the brake-lights of his direct frontal leader [65].
Kerner et al. reﬁned this approach by extending it; their
work resulted in a family of models based on the notion
of a synchronisation distance for individual vehicles; they
are commonly called the KKW-models (from its three au-
thors, Kerner, Klenov, and Wolf) [56].

The theory can describe most of the encountered tempo-
spatial features of congested trafﬁc. And at the moment,
successful microscopic models have been developed, but
the work is not yet over: an important challenge that re-
mains for theoreticians, is the mathematical derivation of
a consistent macroscopic theory (i.e., one that treats traf-
ﬁc at a more aggregate level as a continuum) [55]. In pur-
suit of such a model, Kim incorporated Kerner’s trafﬁc
regimes into a broader framework, encompassing six dif-
ferent possible states: the transitions between these states
are tracked with a modiﬁed macroscopic model that uses
concepts from fuzzy logic theory [64].

E. Theories of trafﬁc breakdown

A central question that is often asked in the ﬁeld of traf-
ﬁc ﬂow theory, is the following: “What causes conges-
tion ?” Clearly, the answer to this question should be
a bit more detailed than the obvious “Because there too
many vehicles on the road !” With respect to the phase
transitions that signal a breakdown of the trafﬁc ﬂow, var-
ious — seemingly contradicting — theories exist. Are
they merely a matter of belief, or can they be rigourously
‘proven’ ? Opinions are divided, but nowadays, two qual-
itatively different mainstream theories exist, attributed to
different schools of thought [12, 77, 108]:

The European (German) school
In the early seventies, Treiterer and Meyers performed
some aerial observations of a platoon of vehicles. As they
constructed individual vehicle trajectories, they could ob-
serve a growing instability in the stream of vehicles, lead-
ing to an apparently emerging phantom jam (i.e., a jam
‘out of nothing’) [110].

Some twenty years later, in the mid-nineties, Kerner and
Konh¨auser made detailed studies of trafﬁc ﬂow measure-
ments, obtained at various detector stations along Ger-
man motorways. Their ﬁndings indicated that phantom
jams seemed to emerge in regions of unstable trafﬁc ﬂow
[59]. This stimulated Kerner and Rehborn to further re-
search efforts directed towards the behaviour of propa-
gating jams [60, 61]. They proposed a different set of
trafﬁc ﬂow regimes, culminating in what is now called
three-phase trafﬁc theory (see section V D for more de-
tails) [55, 57, 62]. The main idea supported by followers
of this school of researchers, is that trafﬁc jams can spon-
taneously emerge, without necessarily having an infras-
tructural reason (e.g., on-ramps, incidents, . . . )[130]. In
dense enough trafﬁc, phase transitions from the free-ﬂow
to the synchronised-ﬂow regime can occur, after which a
local instability such as e.g., a lane change can grow (the
so-called pinch effect), triggering a stable jam leading to
stop-and-go behaviour [57]. Kerner’s three-phase theory
stands out as an archetypical example of these modern
views. But although his theory has, in our opinion, been
worked out well enough, he more than frequently encoun-
ters harsh criticisms when conveying it to most audiences
(perhaps the main cause for this human behaviour is the
fact that Kerner always mentions the same view, i.e., “all
existing trafﬁc ﬂow theories are wrong”).

Inspired by Kerner’s work, Helbing et al. gave in 1999
an extended treatise on the different types of congestion
patterns that can be observed in the vicinity of spatial in-
homogeneities (e.g., on-ramps). Their work resulted in a
universal phase diagram, containing a whole plethora of
patterns of congested trafﬁc states (called homogeneously
congested trafﬁc – HCT, oscillatory congested trafﬁc –
OCT, triggered stop-and-go trafﬁc – TSG, pinned lo-
calised cluster – PLC, and moving localised cluster –
MLC), each one having unique characteristics [48][131].
In that same year, Lee et al. studied the patterns that
emerge at on-ramps, thereby agreeing with the ﬁndings
of Helbing et al.
[70]. As the previous research into
congestion patterns was largely based on the use of ana-
lytical trafﬁc ﬂow models and computer simulations, the
need for validation with empirical data grew. In 2000, the
work of Treiber et al. among others, proved the existence
of the previously mentioned congestion patterns [109].

At this point, it is noteworthy to mention the seminal
work of Nagel and Schreckenberg [92], who in 1992
developed a model that describes trafﬁc ﬂows in which
local jams can form spontaneously. As many variations
on this model have been proposed,
later work also
focussed on the stability of trafﬁc ﬂows in these models,
e.g., the work of Jost and Nagel [53].

The Berkeley school
Including names such as the late Newell, Daganzo,
Bertini, Cassidy, Mu˜noz, . . . , the ‘Berkeley school’ (Uni-
versity of California) supports the theory that all conges-
tion is strictly induced by bottlenecks. The hypothesis
holds for both recurrent and, in the case of an incident,
non-recurrent congestion.

The main starting point states that there is always a ‘ge-
ometrical’ explanation for the breakdown. This expla-
nation is based on the presence of road inhomogeneities
such as on- and off-ramps, tunnels, weaving areas, lane
drops, sharp bends, elevations, . . . Once a jam occurs due
to such a (temporary) bottleneck, it does not dissipate im-
mediately; as a result, drivers can wonder why they enter
and exit a congestion wave, without there being an ap-
parent reason for its presence (since it happened earlier
and the cause e.g., an incident, already got cleared). Da-
ganzo uses this line of reasoning as an explanation for the
dismissal of phantom jams [28].

The school uses a speciﬁc terminology with respect to
bottlenecks (being road inhomogeneities). Two qualita-
tively different regimes exist:
the free-ﬂow regime and
the queued regime. The latter occurs when a bottleneck
becomes active, which will result in a queue growing up-
stream of the bottleneck while a free-ﬂow regime exists
downstream. The bottleneck capacity is then deﬁned as
the maximum sustainable ﬂow downstream (which is dif-
ferent from the maximum ﬂow that can be observed prior
to the bottleneck’s activation).

The location of these bottlenecks has some peculiarities
involved: one of them is the concept of a capacity fun-
nel [11]. It assumes that drivers are at times more alert,
e.g., when they are driving on a motorway and nearing an
on-ramp in rather dense trafﬁc conditions [121]. This im-

pels them to accept shorter headways, so they are driving
closely behind each other at a relatively high speed. Once
they have passed the on-ramp’s location, they tend to re-
lax, resulting in larger headways. The effect is that the
bottleneck’s actual position is located more downstream.

Shortly after the publication of Kerner and Rehborn’s
ﬁndings about the peculiar phase transitions that seemed
to occur on German motorways, Daganzo et al. pro-
vided a swift response where they stated that the occur-
ring phase transitions could also be caused by bottlenecks
in a predictable way [29]. They implied that no spon-
taneously emerging trafﬁc jams are suggested, and that
the observed trafﬁc data from both German and North
American motorways did not contradict their own state-
ments about the cause of the phase transitions [91]. In
short, the subtle difference between their work and that
of Kerner and Rehborn, is that instabilities in the traf-
ﬁc stream are the result and not the cause of the queues
that emerge at active bottlenecks. With respect to a spon-
taneous breakdown of trafﬁc ﬂow at on- and off-ramps
(i.e., bottlenecks), Daganzo also states that this can be
explained using a simple trafﬁc ﬂow model operating un-
der the assumption of a too high inﬂow from the on-ramp
or a caused by blocking of the off-ramp [26].

The studies undertaken by this school, are heavily based
on the researchers’ use of cumulative plots and elegantly
simple trafﬁc ﬂow models, as opposed to the classic
methodology that investigates time series of recorded
counts and speeds. As stated earlier (see section III B 2),
some recent examples include the work of Mu˜noz and
Daganzo [85, 86, 87, 89] and Cassidy and Bertini [7, 15].

Recently, Tamp`ere argued that both theories, as enunci-
ated by the two schools, are not entirely contradictory.
His statement is based on the fact that the mechanisms
behind the bottleneck-induced breakdown and spon-
taneous breakdown are approximately the same, only
differing in the probability of such a breakdown (which
is related to the instability of a trafﬁc ﬂow) [108].

In our view, both theories are sufﬁciently different,
but compatible, in that the ﬁrst school elaborately
describes trafﬁc ﬂow breakdown more or less as hav-
ing an inherently probabilistic nature, whereas the
second school treats breakdown a strict determinis-
tic process. The former introduces a complex vari-
ety of congestion patterns, while the latter primarily
focusses on an elegantly simple description of trafﬁc
ﬂow breakdown. Even more characteristically, is the
observation that most adepts of the European school,
inherently need stochasticity in the models in order to
produce their sought phantom trafﬁc jams (note that
notwithstanding the fact that stochastic models are
in a strict sense also deterministic, we nevertheless
adopt in this dissertation, the convention that deter-
ministic means ‘non-stochastic’). Our argument is in
a way also supported by Nagel and Nelson, who state
that the purpose of the trafﬁc ﬂow model (e.g., the
effect of moving bottlenecks versus predicting mean
trafﬁc behaviour) decide whether or not stochasticity
in the model is required [91].

Furthermore, there might be some room for stochas-
ticity in the Berkeley models after all, with the
work of Laval which suggests that (disruptive) lane
changes form the main cause for instabilities in a
trafﬁc stream [69]. Deciding which school is right,
is therefore in our opinion a matter of personal taste,
but in the end, we agree with Daganzo when he states
that research into bottleneck behaviour is the most
important in the context of trafﬁc ﬂow theory [30].

VI. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, an extensive account was given, detailing
several aspects related to the description of trafﬁc ﬂows.
Most importantly, we have introduced a nomenclature
convention, built upon a consistent set of notations. Our
discussion of trafﬁc ﬂow characteristics centred around
the space and time headways as microscopic characteris-
tics, with densities and ﬂows as their macroscopic coun-
terparts. Several noteworthy highlights are the technique
of oblique cumulative plots and the derivation of travel
times based on these plots. A ﬁnally large part of this
paper reviewed some of the relations between trafﬁc ﬂow
characteristics, i.e., the fundamental diagrams, and clari-
ﬁed some of the different points of view adopted by the
trafﬁc engineering community.

[122] Note that when calculating the total density using equa-
tion (5), the partial densities can also correspond without
loss of generality to different vehicle classes instead of
just different lanes [27, 115].

[123] In most cases, volume denotes the number of vehicles
counted during a certain time period, as opposed to ﬂow
which is just the equivalent hourly rate.

[124] Note that the hypothesis also assumes that the variables

are spatially measured, e.g., space-mean speed.

[126] Note that in a broader sense, queueing delays also en-
compass delays at signallised and unsignallised intersec-
tions.

[127] The TRB was formerly known as the Highway Research

Board (HRB).

[128] Note that this capacity ﬂow is not an extreme value, i.e.,
it can be different from the maximum observed ﬂow. The
reason is that, with respect to the nature of the fundamen-
tal diagram, the capacity ﬂow is taken to be an average
value [44, 72].

[129] The detector station is called CLO3, which is an acronym

for ‘Camera Linkeroever’.

[130] But note that bottleneck-induced trafﬁc ﬂow breakdowns

are not excluded by the theory of Kerner et al.

[131] In addition, they also provided a link with Kerner’s three-
phase theory, whereby synchronised ﬂow can correspond
to HCT, OCT, or PLC, and moving jams can correspond
to TSG or MLC states [49].

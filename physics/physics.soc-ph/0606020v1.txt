A large set of daily FOREX time series is analyzed. The corresponding
correlation matrices (CM) are constructed for USD, EUR and PLZ used
as the base currencies. The triangle rule is interpreted as constraints re-
ducing the number of independent returns. The CM spectrum is computed
and compared with the cases of shuﬄed currencies and a ﬁctitious random
currency taken as a base currency. The Minimal Spanning Tree (MST)
graphs are calculated and the clustering eﬀects for strong currencies are
found. It is shown that for MSTs the node rank has power like, scale free
behavior. Finally, the scaling exponents are evaluated and found in the
range analogous to those identiﬁed recently for various complex networks.

1. Introduction

Analysis of correlations among ﬁnancial assets is of great interest for
practical, as well as for fundamental reasons. Practical aspects are mainly
related to the theory of optimal portfolios [1]. The theoretical interest re-
sults from the fact that such study may shed more light on the universal
aspects of complex systems organization. The world currency network can
deﬁnitely be considered as complex.

In this paper we analyze daily FOREX (FX) time series of 60 currencies
(including gold, silver and platinum) from the period Dec 1998 – May 2005,
provided by University of British Columbia [2]. The 5σ ﬁlter was applied
to avoid spikes due to errors.

For a value xi(t) of the ith asset (i = 1, . . . , N ) at time t, one deﬁnes its

return Gi(t) as

Gi(t) = ln xi(t + τ )

The stock market time series xi(t) are always expressed in terms of the
local currency. However, for the FX data we have exchange rates, instead.
Denoting currencies by n consecutive capital Latin letters A, B, C, . . . the
corresponding FX data xi(t) can be expressed as their quotients: xAB(t) =
A(t)/B(t). Neglecting friction caused by fees (this is usually negligible in
open market transactions) one obtains two types of constraints among n
currencies

where the second constraint is called the triangle rule [3]. Eqs. (3) can be
rewritten in terms of returns that gives the following identities

currency (denominators) and we shell call it the base currency. Taking
diﬀerent currencies as the base currency one can obtain a diﬀerent ”picture”
of the market though in principle all these pictures should contain the same
information.

In this paper we construct correlation matrices (CMs) for the FX time
series and the corresponding Minimal Spanning Trees (MSTs). Finally, the
scale free distribution of node multiplicity is found and the corresponding
scaling exponents are estimated. The complex network approach seems
to be one of the most promising do deal with such extremely complicated
systems, as was suggested recently [4, 5].

The (symmetric) correlation matrix can also be computed in terms of the

By construction the trace of a correlation matrix equals to the number

of time series

Tr C = N .

When some of the time series become strongly dependent, zero eigenvalues
emerge (zero modes).

The eigenspectrum of CM for USD, EUR and PLN as the base currency
is plotted in Fig 1. For comparison, two additional sets of time series were
generated. As the ﬁrst one, the USD based time series were taken and all
of them were randomly and independently shuﬄed. This set is denoted as
(rnd). As all time correlations are destroyed the case (rnd) is clearly diﬀerent
than all other cases. In particular, it is very close to the random matrix

where q = T /N . In our case eq. (8) gives λmin = 0.67 and λmax = 1.41, in
perfect agreement with the plot.

In the second case, a ﬁctitious currency was genereted with returns iden-
tical to Gaussian uncorrelated noise and it was used as the base currency
for our time series. In this case time correlations of all other real currencies
were preserved and it is denoted as ”ﬁctitious” (ﬁct). The CM spectrum
here is qualitatively similar to real currencies.

For the real currencies the maximal eigenvalue is smallest for USD, larger
for EUR, much larger for PLZ and the largest for a ﬁctitious random cur-
rency taken as the base currency, respectively. The magnitude of separation
of the largest eigenvalue from λmax can be considered a measure of collec-
tivity of the underlying dynamics [7]. Similar eﬀects are observed for the
stock market correlations [8].

only moderate size clusters are visible.

3. Minimal Spanning Tree graphs

Looking at large numerical matrices is not very enlightening. Instead,
there are useful visualizations that can be used for their analysis. In par-
ticular, the Minimal Spanning Trees that were introduced in graph theory
long ago [9, 10] and later rediscovered several times [11, 12]. Recently they
were applied to analyze the stock correlations [13]. Here, to draw the MST
graph the following metric has been proposed

d(i, j) = q2(1

Cij) .

(9)

Nodes corresponding to assets with the closest correlation coeﬃcients are
successively linked with a line. As a result one obtains a tree-like connected
graph.

The corresponding MST graphs for USD, EUR and PLN are shown in
Figs. 2–4, respectively. In Fig. 2 USD is absent and one can see nodes with
relatively small degree (small number of links). On the other hand, for EUR
taken as the base currency (Fig. 3) we have two large clusters — USD and
SAR cluster, both with high degree. The SAR cluster is present because of

the strong coupling of both currencies, USD and SAR. The last currency
is artiﬁcially ﬁxed to USD. In Fig. 4 PLN is taken as the base currency.
Here, we have a larger USD cluster and smaller clusters, including the EUR
cluster. The picture here is in a sense intermediate.

We have also plotted MST for the correlation matrix with the USD as
the base currency, but all the corresponding currency return time series
are shuﬄed independently (Fig. 5).
In this case all time correlations are
killed. This corresponds to the (rnd) spectrum in Fig. 1. In this case larger
clusters are absent, as one can expect. Finally, for a ﬁctitious (ﬁct) randomly
generated currency (a prototype of a currency whose dynamics is completely
disconnected from the rest) as the base currency one obtains MST graph
as in Fig. 6. Here, its structure is qualitatively similar as for PLN taken as
the base currency. This similarity even on a more quantitative level can be
seen from Fig. 1.

4. Power like scaling and conclusions

Because we have used considerably large number of currencies it is possi-
ble to estimate the integrated distribution of the nodes’ degree for all plots.

cluster. Modest EUR cluster in the left part of the graph.

The most interesting question is the type of this distribution. For complex
networks it has been found that these distributions usually have scale free
power like scaling.
Indeed, we have found good power like scaling in all
cases except for the shuﬄed case, where all time correlations are wiped out.
The log–log plot of the integrated probability distribution for the nodes’
degree (multiplicity) is plotted in Fig. 7. The corresponding dashed lines
represent the power like ﬁts. The numerical data are listed in Table 1. In
addition to the scaling exponent, α, its standard error, relative error and
Pearsons-r coeﬃcient are given. Except the shuﬄed case, standard error is
of order of a few percent and the r-coeﬃcient is > 0.97. This suggests a good
power like scaling. The largest error is for USD. In this case, power like ﬁt
seems to be not so good. For the shuﬄed case, where time correlations are
wiped out, one cannot see a power like scaling at all. The case of currencies
expressed in terms of the USD seems to interpolate between the scale free
and the shuﬄed cases. This may reﬂect the strong independence of the US
currency.

Numerical results for all ﬁts can be found in Table 1.

It is worth to
notice, that, except the shuﬄed case, for all cases we have obtained the

scaling exponent in the range 1 < α < 2 (with average close to 1.6), the same
range as for the ﬁnite average L´evy stable distributions [14]. What is more
important, with rare exceptions, these exponents are similar to those found
in diﬀerent complex networks, such as WWW pages (α = 1.4), physical
internet networks with nodes representing hosts (1.38), routers (1.18) and
peer–to–peer networks (1.19), protein–protein interaction network in the
yeast (1.4), metabolic reactins network (1.15), movie actor collaboration
network (1.3), phone calls (1.1), words co-occurence (1.7) — for references
see [4, 5].

Abstract

We present a novel analysis extending the recent work of Mizuno et al. [7] on the hy-
perinﬂations of Germany (1920/1/1-1923/11/1), Hungary (1945/4/30-1946/7/15),
Brazil (1969-1994), Israel (1969-1985), Nicaragua (1969-1991), Peru (1969-1990) and
Bolivia (1969-1985). On the basis of a generalization of Cagan’s model of inﬂation
based on the mechanism of “inﬂationary expectation” or positive feedbacks between
realized growth rate and people’s expected growth rate, we ﬁnd that hyperinﬂations
can be characterized by a power law singularity culminating at a critical time tc.
Mizuno et al. [7] ’s double-exponential function can be seen as a discrete time-step
approximation of our more general nonlinear ODE formulation of the price dynam-
ics which exhibits a ﬁnite-time singular behavior. This extension of Cagan’s model,
which makes natural the appearance of a critical time tc, has the advantage of pro-
viding a well-deﬁned end of the clearly unsustainable hyperinﬂation regime. We ﬁnd
an excellent and reliable agreement between theory and data for Germany, Hungary,
Peru and Bolivia. For Brazil, Israel and Nicaragua, the super-exponential growth
seems to be already contaminated signiﬁcantly by the existence of a cross-over to a
stationary regime.

1 Introduction

Inﬂation is the economic situation in which prices apparently move mono-
tonically upward and the value of money decreases. To classical economics,
inﬂation is the undue increase in the supply of credit above the level that is
supported by current savings. High inﬂation is always associated with high
rates of money supply growth while the relationship is weak for countries with
low inﬂation [2]. Thus, ﬁghting high inﬂation requires reducing the growth
rate of the money supply.

Inﬂation is one of the few big issues in macroeconomics, together with unem-
ployment, monetary policy, ﬁscal policy, import-export deﬁcits, productivity,
government spending and the business cycle, and has been at the forefront
of public battles over the past half-century. A good economic policy should
strive to achieve a balance between often contradictory requirements: for in-
stance, many economists assume that unemployment tends toward a natural
rate below which it cannot go without creating inﬂation. Samuelson and Solow
had brought to the U.S. the empirical evidence, ﬁrst compiled by the British
economist A.W. Phillips, that there seems to be a tradeoﬀ between inﬂa-
tion and unemployment–that is, higher inﬂation meant lower unemployment.
There is thus a long tradition among economists to adopt monetary policy as
a way to keep the economy running on high-employment overdrive. Allowing
prices to rise seemed the only humane thing to do. Friedman argued however
that the unemployment/inﬂation tradeoﬀ was temporary, and he also pointed
out that using ﬁscal and monetary policy to avert recessions was a lot harder
than it looked. The diﬃculties stem from the fact that policies designed to re-
strain inﬂation by lowering the level of aggregate demand will tend to depress
investment and harm capacity. Improved industrial performance requires a
climate conducive to investment and research and development, which in turn
depends on, inter alia, high and stable levels of aggregate demand. Business
and inﬂation cycles often result from the combination of endogenous inter-
actions (that can lead to incoherence) and of the eﬀects of institutions to
contain these tendencies in the economy. The corresponding economic times
series can exhibit smooth growth and well-behaved cycles as possible tran-
sitory results of the economic processes, but can also allow for intermittent
conditions conducive to the emergence of incoherence or turbulence. Institu-
tional factors attempt to act as circuit breakers on the economy. Whenever
institutionally determined values dominate endogenously determined values,
the path of the economy is broken and an interactive process, which starts
with new initial conditions, generates future values. Speciﬁcally, whenever the
economy threatens to behave incoherently, these stabilizers, whether built-in
or activated by government authority, prevent the economy from continuing
on the prior determined path, with the corresponding added complication and
possible elements of destabilization. These are important elements in the path

2

evolution of inﬂation.

In standard economic theory, inﬂation is associated with money supply growth.
At equilibrium, money determines price level and implies equilibrium in mar-
kets for other assets. At equilibrium, money demand depends primarily on
income and interest rates. But there are several factors keeping money de-
mand unstable, such as ﬁnancial innovations as well expectations. Indeed, one
of the major causes of the complexity in stabilizing inﬂation together with
other macroeconomic variables is that expectations of producers, consumers
and investors may play a key role in the dynamics. Indeed, investment allo-
cations or inﬂation expectations are inﬂuenced by ex-ante values of the risk
premia and ex-post returns are rough approximations of these. Thus, “inﬂa-
tionary expectation” occurs when people begin to raise prices not because of
actual changes in supply or demand or cost or the size of the money supply,
but out of fear that some such changes might happen. In the 1990s, when
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the US federal reserve, said that the U.S.
was still suﬀering from the inﬂationary expectations caused by the mone-
tary excess of the 1970s, he was directly addressing the potential for inﬂation
caused by “inﬂationary expectations.” When European central banks added
liquidity to the gold market in an attempt to prevent an increase in the price
of gold from creating concerns about a decrease in the value of the dollar,
they were addressing the psychological component of price stability involved
in “inﬂationary expectations.” Mathematically, this dynamics translates into
sets of coupled nonlinear equations expressing both the competition and de-
lays between expectations and realizations and the presence of positive and
negative feedback loops. The complexity of the resulting dynamics stems from
the complex nonlinear negative and positive feedback processes intertwining
the diﬀerent component of policies.

There are several causes of inﬂation. A prominent origin is wars, which cause
the type of inﬂation that results from a rapid expansion of money and credit.
For instance, in World War I, the American people were characteristically
unwilling to ﬁnance the total war eﬀort out of increased taxes. This had been
true in the Civil War and was also so in World War II and the Vietnam War.
Much of the expenditures in World War I, were ﬁnanced out of the inﬂationary
increases in the money supply. If money supply growth and real income are
constant, then expected inﬂation rate equals current inﬂation rate (assuming
no change in elasticities). This is more or less the standard situation most
of the time, as nominal interest rates and inﬂation often move together. In
contrast, if people expect an increase in money growth, this then would lead
to expect higher inﬂation. And expectation of higher inﬂation raises inﬂation
rate even if money growth does not actually increase.

If inﬂation is perfectly anticipated, it entails no cost for creditors and debtors
as nominal interest rates incorporate expected inﬂation and nominal wages

3

adjust to oﬀset price increases. But inﬂation devalues the currency and imposes
“shoe leather costs”, that are costs of eﬀorts to minimize cash holding (for
instance the time and eﬀort in making lots of trips to ATM machines). Prices
will be changed more frequently and this imposes “menu costs,” which are the
costs of changing prices.

If inﬂation is unanticipated, it induces transfers of wealth from holders of
nominal assets to holders of real assets [11]. Suppose for instance that your
savings account pays 8% per year and that you expected 4% inﬂation but the
realized inﬂation is 7%. You obtain a real interest rate is 1% instead of the 4%
that you expected. You are worse oﬀ but the bank is better oﬀ. Unanticipated
inﬂation increases risk of gaining or losing wealth and requires more resources
for forecasting inﬂation. Unanticipated inﬂation causes confusion about the
relative price movements as it could aﬀect some prices sooner than others.
What if the price of oil increases relative to natural gas? Is that a change in
relative prices, or a result of inﬂation? If the former holds, consumers should
switch from oil to natural gas for heating. If the latter holds, and they switch,
then resources are misallocated. More generally, informal accounts of inﬂa-
tion’s eﬀects are common, but there are few models which get to grips with
the central eﬀects. Partly as a result of this, and partly as a result of many
econometric problems, much of the empirical evidence remains unconvincing
(see [11] for an assessment of the various contributions). For all these reasons,
a main target of central banks of developed countries in the last decade of the
twentieth century has been a low inﬂation [3].

As we have seen, inﬂation is ﬁrst-of-all an indirect tax leveraged by govern-
ments through their (partial) control of the money supply to help them ﬁ-
nance wars or other expenditures. The problem is that inﬂation is not easily
controlled due to the dual eﬀect of ﬁnancial innovations and expectations.
Once people start to expect an inﬂation regime, their expectations may lead
to strong positive feedbacks that make inﬂation run away. There are sev-
eral remarkable historical examples of such runaways, called “hyperinﬂation,”
such as those that occurred in Germany (1922-1923), Hungary (1945-1946),
Latin America in the 1980s and Russia in the recent years. Such hyperinﬂa-
tion phases are very costly to society, as there are enormous “shoe-leather”
costs, the workers have to be paid more frequently (even daily) and there are
rushes to spend the currency before prices rise further. Hyperinﬂation reduce
real value of taxes collected, which are often set in nominal terms and by
the time they are paid, real value has fallen. Hyperinﬂation leads to large
disruptive eﬀects on price and on wage changes and prevents distinguishing
relative from aggregate price movements. Wealth allocation becomes very in-
eﬃcient. Detecting hyperinﬂation in an early stage might contribute to avoid
such tragedy.

In a recent work, Mizuno et al. [7] have analyzed the hyperinﬂations of Ger-

4

many (1920/1/1-1923/11/1), Hungary (1945/4/30-1946/7/15), Brazil (1969-
1994), Israel (1969-1985), Nicaragua (1969-1991), Peru (1969-1990) and Bo-
livia (1969-1985), and showed that the price indices or currency exchange rates
of these countries grew super-exponentially according to a double-exponential
function eb1eb2t of time (with b1, b2 > 0). This super-exponential growth was
argued to result from a nonlinear positive feedback process in which the past
market price growth inﬂuences the people’s expected future price, which it-
self impacts the ex-post realized market price. This autocatalytic process is
fundamentally based on the mechanism of “inﬂationary expectation” alluded
to above and is similar to the positive feedbacks occurring during speculative
bubbles due to imitative and herd behaviors [8].

Clearly, a super-exponential growing inﬂation is unsustainable. While provid-
ing a useful mathematical description of hyperinﬂation, the double-exponential
model of Mizuno et al does not provide a rigorous determination of the end
of the hyperinﬂation regime [7]. Here, we re-examine the theory and empirical
evidence developed in [7] and show that the double-exponential law is nothing
but a discrete-time approximation of a general power law growth endowed
with a ﬁnite-time singularity at some critical time tc. The ﬁnite-time singular-
ity allows us to deﬁne unambiguously the theoretical end of the hyperinﬂation
regime as being tc by deﬁnition. This theory provides the ﬁrst practical ap-
proach for detecting hyperinﬂation and predicting its future path until its end.
In practice, the end of an hyperinﬂation regime is expected to occur somewhat
earlier than at the asymptotic critical time tc, because governments and central
banks are forced to do something before the inﬁnity is reached in ﬁnite time.
Such actions are the equivalent of ﬁnite-size and boundary condition eﬀects
in physical systems undergoing similar ﬁnite-time singularities. Hyperinﬂation
regimes are of special interest as they emphasize in an almost pure way the
impact of collective behavior of people interacting through their expectations.

2 From double-exponential growth to ﬁnite-time singularity

In order to establish the correspondence between the double-exponential and
the power law formulas, let us ﬁrst summarize the approach followed by
Mizuno et al. [7] who extend Cagan’s theory of inﬂation [1] in terms of a
set of evolution equations linking the market price p(t) with the people’s av-
eraged expectation price p∗(t). These two prices are thought to evolve due
to a positive feedback mechanism: an upward change of market price p(t) in
a unit time ∆t induces a rise in the people’s expectation price, and such an
anticipation pulls up the market price. Cagan’s assumption that the growth
rate of p∗(t) is proportional to the past realized growth rate of the market
price p(t) is expressed by the following equation

.

Introducing the growth rates deﬁned by

r(t) ≡

r∗(t) ≡

,

p(t + ∆t)
p(t)
p∗(t + ∆t)
p∗(t)

,

r(t) = r∗(t − ∆t) ,
r∗(t) = r(t − ∆t) ,

expressions (1) and (2) are equivalent to

whose solution is r(t + ∆t) = r(t − ∆t) and expresses the spontaneous forma-
tion of a constant ﬁnite growth rate characterizing a steady state exponential
inﬂation.

In order to explain hyperinﬂation regimes, Mizuno et al. [7] generalizes Cagan’s
assumption that the growth rate of p∗(t) is proportional to the past realized
growth rate of the market price p(t) and introduce a nonlinear dependence in
equation (2) which is transformed into

p∗(t + ∆t)
p∗(t)

=

p(t)
p(t − ∆t) !

 

b

,

which can be written

∗

r

(t) = b r(t − ∆t) .

Cagan’s original model is recovered for the special case b = 1. The system
(1,7) or equivalently (5,8) studied by Mizuno et al. [7] is obtained from a
coarse-graining (or Monte-Carlo renormalization group) procedure of a more
general system of equations developed by Mizuno et al. [7].

Expression (1) describes the dynamical tendency for the market price p(t)
to converge towards the expected price p∗(t). The equation (7) involving the
nonlinear function (p(t)/p(t − ∆t))b with b > 1 captures the concept that peo-
ple re-adjust their expectation in a signiﬁcant way only if the realized market
price change in the previous unit time interval was signiﬁcant. An exponent

6

b larger than 1 captures the fact that the adjustment of the expected price
p∗ is weak for small changes of the realized market prices and becomes very
strong for large deviations. This embodies the fact that people have only a
rough sense of what to expect for the future and can only form rather fuzzy
expectations. The expected price p∗(t) is thus estimated with a rather poor
credibility. As a consequence, the agents have no incentive to move much their
expectation if the past realized prices have changed little because such small
change might be within the fuzziness zone of determination of their expecta-
tions. Only when the price change is large, will the agents act and modify their
expectation of a large future increase of the prices, thus making it happen.
This eﬀect is embodied in the nonlinear function (p(t)/p(t − ∆t))b with b > 1,
leading to a kind of threshold eﬀect. The larger is the exponent b above 1,
the closer is this eﬀect to a threshold below which the people’s expectation
do not change much and above which the revision of their expectation is dra-
matically revised upward. We believe that such nonlinear response functions
embody much more realistically real people’s behavior than do linear models
used in standard economic models. Exactly the same mechanism has been
invoked in a dynamical model of market prices resulting from the interplay
between fundamental and technical investments in Refs.[4,10].

The system (5,8) gives r(t + ∆t) = b r(t − ∆t), whose solution is r(t) ∝ eb2t
leading to the announced double exponential form for the market price [7]

p(t) ≈ eb1eb2t

,

(9)

where b1 and b2 are two positive constants.

Here, we propose an diﬀerent version of the nonlinear feedback process. We
keep expression (1) or equivalently equation (5) and replace equation (7) or
equivalently expression (8) by

r∗(t) = r(t − ∆t) + a[r(t − ∆t)]m , with m > 1 .

(10)

Note that our new formulation (10) retrieves Cagan’s formulation (6) for a = 0.
It is also close to Mizuno et al.’s form [7], which is recovered for m = 1. We
believe that this formulation (10) better captures the intrinsically nonlinear
process of the formation of expectations. Indeed, if r(t − ∆t) is small (ex-
plicitly, if it is smaller than 1/a1/m), the second nonlinear term a[r(t − ∆t)]m
in the right-hand-side of (10) is negligible compared with the ﬁrst Cagan’s
term r(t − ∆t) and one recovers the exponentially growing inﬂation regime
of normal times. However, when the realized growth rate becomes signiﬁcant,
people’s expectations start to amplify these realized growth rates, leading to
a super-exponential growth. Geometrically, the diﬀerence between our formu-
lation (10) and that of Mizuno et al.’s form [7] consists in replacing a straight

7

(11)

(12)

(13)

(14)

of slope b larger than 1 by a upward convex function with unit slope at the
origin and whose local slope increases monotonously with the argument.

Putting equation (5) together with expression (10) leads to

r(t + ∆t) = r(t − ∆t) + a[r(t − ∆t)]m .

Keeping time discrete, the long-time solution of (11) is dominated by the
second term a[r(t − ∆t)]m for m > 1 and is of the form

for some constant r0, that is, it takes the form of a double-exponential growth
for the growth rate and thus of a triple exponential growth for the market
price. Taking the continuous limit, expression (11) becomes

r(t) ∼ (r0)m(t/2∆t)

dr
dt

= a1[r(t)]m ,

where a1 is a positive coeﬃcient. Its solution exhibits a ﬁnite-time singularity

r(t) = a1r(0)

1/(m−1)

,

tc
tc − t (cid:19)

(cid:18)

where the critical time tc = (m − 1)/[r(0)]m−1 is determined by the initial
condition r(0) and the exponent m. The comparison between expressions (12)
and (14) reveals the general fact that a ﬁnite-time singularity (14) becomes
a double-exponential (14) when the dynamics is expressed in discrete time
steps. Indeed, in contrast with a continuous ordinary diﬀerential equation
(ODE) which may exhibit a ﬁnite-time singularity, a discrete equation can not
exhibit a genuine exact ﬁnite time singularity. A true ﬁnite time singularity
is impossible as soon as time is discrete. The reason is clear: the ﬁnite time
singularity comes from the fact that the doubling time is divided by some
factor larger than one after a time evolution equal to the doubling time, so
that the doubling time shrinks to zero eventually (this is a simple way to view
the ﬁnite time singularity). When the doubling time becomes comparable to
the time step ∆t, it cannot shrink below it and there is a crossover from the
ﬁnite time singularity acceleration to an un-ending exponential of exponential
growth. Thus, a power law singularity is essentially undistinguishable from an
exponential of an exponential of time, except when the distance tc −t from the
ﬁnite time singularity becomes comparable with the time step ∆t. This is the
reason why our present analysis is compatible with that reported in Ref. [7].
The main diﬀerence lies in the fact that the continuous time solution contains

8

an information on the end of the growth phase, embodied in the existence of
the critical time tc.

The price is the exponential of the integral of r(t) and also exhibits a ﬁnite-
time singularity at the same critical value tc. The time dependence of the
market price p(t) exhibits the two following regimes.

• Finite-time singularity in the price itself:

ln p(t) = A + B (tc − t)

−α , with α =

> 0 and B > 0 , for 1 < m < 2.(15)

This solution corresponds to a genuine divergence of ln p(t) in ﬁnite time at
the critical value tc.

• Finite-time singularity in the derivative or slope of the price:

ln p(t) = A′ − B′ (tc − t)α′

, with α′ =

> 0 and B′ > 0 , for 2 < m .(16)

2 − m
m − 1

m − 2
m − 1

As time approaches the critical value tc, the price accelerates with an inﬁnite
slope (since 0 < α′ < 1 for m > 2) reached at tc, while remaining ﬁnite at
the value A′.

A and A′ are additive constants resulting from the integration of the growth
rate r(t). Such ﬁnite-time singularities are similar to those obtained in the
dynamics of the world population, economic and ﬁnancial indices [6] and can
be seen as a special case of the Sornette-Ide model [10,4].

We will thus use equations (15) and (16) to ﬁt the hyperinﬂation of the his-
torical price index of Bolivia, Peru, Israel, Brazil, Nicaragua, Hungary and
Germany (ordered from the most recent to most ancient).

In addition, in order to test the robustness of these power laws, it may be
useful to recognize that the whole time span may not be fully captured by the
inﬂationary expectation mechanism embodied in expression (11) and that the
power law ﬁnite-time singularities may be preceded by a non-singular regime.
We postulate that the early time non-singular regime may be described by
replacing tc −t in equation (15) by tanh[(tc −t)/τ ], which describes a crossover
from exponential growth to a power law singularity. This amounts to replacing
expressions (15) or (16) by

ln[p(t)] = A + B tanh[(tc − t)/τ ]−α ,

(17)

which contains a novel parameter τ . Notice that, when tc − t ≪ τ , tanh[(tc −
t)/τ ] = (tc − t)/τ and one recovers the pure power law (with τ digested inside
the constant B). Only for tc − t ≥ τ does the hyperbolic tangent provide a
cross-over to an exponential law. This form (17) has been found to describe

9

very well the cross-over from the non-critical to the critical regime of rup-
ture of heterogeneous materials [9], allowing a signiﬁcant improvement of the
reliability of failure predictions [5].

3 Applications

3.1 Clear-cut cases of ﬁnite-time singularities

The hyperinﬂations of Bolivia, Peru, Hungary and Germany are well ﬁtted by
expressions (15) (continuous lines) and (17) (dashed lines) as shown in Figs. 1,
2, 3 and 4, respectively. The parameters of the ﬁts with formulas (15) and
(17) to the hyperinﬂation price time series of the four countries Bolivia, Peru,
Hungary and Germany are given in Table 1. There are very small diﬀerences
between the ﬁts obtained with expressions (15) and (17), suggesting that the
considered time intervals are fully in the inﬂationary expectation regime with
strong positive feedbacks. In particular, the exponents α are very robust and
the critical times tc are unchanged between the two formulas for Bolivia and
Hungary, while tc is moved by two weeks for Germany and by four months
for Peru. We also tested the robustness of these results by restricting the ﬁts
with to the two formulas (15) and (17) to the last half of each time series. We
ﬁnd that the exponents α and critical times tc are essentially unchanged for
the two most dramatic hyperinﬂation of Hungary and Germany, while tc is
pushed forward in the future for Bolivia (by a few years) and Peru (by a few
months), without signiﬁcant degradation of the quality of the ﬁts. This shows
that only for Hungary and Germany can one ascertain the critical time of the
ﬁnite-time singularity with good precision.

In the case of Hungary, the hyperinﬂation was eventually stopped by the in-
troduction of the present Hungary currency, the Forint, in July 1946. Our
prediction of the critical time tc at the beginning of September 1946 suggests
that an action on the part of the government was unavoidable as the hyper-
inﬂation was close to its climax.

3.2 Evidence of a ﬁnite-time singularity regime in p(t) and not in ln p(t)

The cases of Israel, Brazil and Nicaragua are not as clear-cut. While the hyper-
inﬂation of these countries clearly exhibited a faster than exponential growth
as can be seen from the upward curvature of the logarithm of the price as a
function of time in Figs. 5-7, a ﬁt of the price index time series with expres-
sions (15) and (17) give an exponent α larger than 15 and critical times tc in

10

the range 2020 − 2080, which are un-realistic. The results are not improved by
reducing the time intervals over which the ﬁts are performed. The results are
not improved either by using the alternative formula (16) valid for m > 2 for
which the singularity is weaker as it occurs only on the slope of the log-price.

It is possible that these problems stem from the fact that the latter prices close
to the end of the time series start to enter a cross-over to a saturation, as would
be expected due to ﬁnite-size and rounding eﬀects. Indeed, close enough to
the mathematically predicted singularity, one expects that the realized price
indexes will eventually saturate and the price dynamics will enter another
regime. We believe that it is the start of this regime that makes diﬃcult our
recovery of the parameters of expressions (15) and (17). In other words, the
problem is not the diﬀerence between (15) and (17) capturing a non-critical
regime at early times but rather a cross-over to a saturation of the singularity
at the latest times.

Since we do not have a theory describing the saturation of the super-exponential
growth, we resort to the trick of ﬁtting p(t) rather than ln p(t) with the right-
hand-sides of expressions (15) and (17). This procedure can be seen as the
continuous ODE formulation of the double-exponential description of the price
index growth advocated by Mizuno et al. [7]. The results are shown in Figs. 5,
6, 7 and Table 2. Notice that, in contrast with the previous cases of Bolivia,
Peru, Hungary and Germany, the characteristic cross-over time τ is rather
small, signaling the existence of a signiﬁcant non-critical regime at early times.
For Israel, the ﬁt of the price index p(t) with the right-hand-side of Eq. (17)
fails since it has a much larger ﬁt error χ = 0.348 than that χ = 0.085 of the
ﬁt using Eq. (15) and the estimated tc = 1991.44 is too far oﬀ compared with
tc = 1988.06 for the ﬁt of (15).

4 Conclusion

We have presented a novel analysis extending the recent work of Mizuno et al.
[7] who analyzed the hyperinﬂations of Germany (1920/1/1-1923/11/1), Hun-
gary (1945/4/30-1946/7/15), Brazil (1969-1994), Israel (1969-1985), Nicaragua
(1969-1991), Peru (1969-1990) and Bolivia (1969-1985). On the basis of a gen-
eralization of Cagan’s model of inﬂation based on the mechanism of “inﬂa-
tionary expectation” or positive feedbacks between realized growth rate and
people’s expected growth rate, Mizuno et al. [7] have proposed to describe the
super-exponential hyperinﬂation by a double-exponential function. Here, we
have extended their reasoning by noting that the double-exponential function
is nothing but a discrete time-step approximation of a more general non-
linear ODE formulation of the price dynamics which exhibits a ﬁnite-time
singular behavior. In this framework, the double-exponential description is

11

undistinguishable from a power law singularity, except close to the critical
time tc. Our new extension of Cagan’s model, which makes natural the ap-
pearance of a critical time tc, has the advantage of providing a well-deﬁned
end of the clearly unsustainable hyperinﬂation regime. We have calibrated
our theory to the seven price index time series mentioned above and ﬁnd
an excellent and reliable agreement for Germany (1920/1/1-1923/11/1), Hun-
gary (1945/4/30-1946/7/15), Peru (1969-1990) and Bolivia (1969-1985). For
Brazil (1969-1994), Israel (1969-1985) and Nicaragua (1969-1991), we think
that the super-exponential growth is already contaminated signiﬁcantly by
the existence of a cross-over to a stationary regime and the calibration of
our theory to these data sets has been more problematic. Nevertheless, by a
simple change of variable from ln p(t) to p(t), we obtain reasonable ﬁts, but
with much less predictive power. The evidence brought here of well-deﬁned
power law singularities reinforces the concept that positive nonlinear feedback
processes are important mechanisms to understand ﬁnancial processes, as ad-
vocated elsewhere for ﬁnancial crashes (see Ref. [8] and references therein)
and for population dynamics [4,10].

Table 1
Parameters of the ﬁts with formulas (15) and (17) as indicated in the ﬁrst column to
the hyperinﬂation price time series of the four countries Bolivia, Peru, Hungary and
Germany. The price indices entered a crossover regime after the end of each period
except for Hungary whose hyperinﬂation of the Pengo was stopped artiﬁcially by
the introduction of the Forint in July 1946. χ denotes the root-mean-square residue
of the mean-square ﬁts. The price index p(t) for Bolivia and Peru is normalized
to p(1969) = 1 at the beginning of 1969. For Hungary, the time series is the price
index. For Germany, it is the exchange rate between the Mark and the US dollar.

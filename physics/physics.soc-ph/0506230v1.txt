A Study of the Leaky Pipeline Phenomenon
for Women in Physics Past the Postdoctoral Level,
and a Critique of the AIP 2005 report on Women in Physics and Astronomy

S.Towers, PhD
Physics Department
State University of New York at Stony Brook

(Dated: February 2, 2008)

The author has recently examined the departmental web pages of the ‘top 50’ physics research
universities, as ranked by the National Research Council (NRC) [4]. Most of the departmental
web pages contained biographical data (ie; year and institute of PhD, etc) of their faculty mem-
bers. Of the approximately 1750 faculty members at the ‘top 50’ universities that were examined,
approximately 100 were female, and around 1425 had available biographical data.

Based on this data, the predicted fractions of female faculty members at the ‘top 50’ universities

are 0.129,0.104, and 0.052 at the assistant, associate, and full faculty levels, respectively.

The observed fractions are 0.107, 0.109, 0.043, respectively.
The overall observed number of women faculty is about 15% less than expected, and the depletion

is statistically signiﬁcant.

Unfortunately, the study ﬁnds that the ”leaky pipeline” is found to be alive and well for women
in academic physics above the postdoctoral level, at all stages of the faculty career ladder. This
result is stark contrast with the conclusion of the American Institute of Physics (AIP) 2005 report
on Women in Physics and Astronomy; the AIP report concludes that women are actually more
likely to be hired at the faculty level than their male peers.

In this paper, we will discuss the two key ﬂaws in the AIP analysis that led to their faulty
conclusion, then describe in detail the analysis performed by the author that corrects these ﬂaws to
get an accurate estimate of the ‘leakiness’ of the academic pipeline for women physicists past the
postdoctoral level.

To be submitted to the American Journal of Physics

2

Many studies have documented the ”leaky pipeline” phenomenon for women in the academic hard sciences
(see, for instance, references [1] and [2]). A recent report that caught the author’s interest was the American
Institute of Physics 2005 report on Women in Physics and Astronomy [3]; this report is rather unique in that it
concludes that the leaky pipeline phenomenon does not exist past the doctoral level. In fact, the report concludes
that the observed fraction of female faculty members is actually higher than expected.

However, careful examination of the report reveals that the analysis that led to this conclusion was ﬂawed;
ﬁrst, the report lumps faculty members at PhD granting universities together with faculty members at teaching
colleges. At teaching colleges, the faculty are more likely to be female, yet much less likely to teach physics
to physicists. Thus the AIP report gives little indication of the fraction of women at the faculty level at the
universities in America that produce the majority of physics doctoral degrees. Second, the analysis performed for
the report did not properly take into account the diﬀering age distributions of male and female faculty members
(the report used instead the combined age distribution of both males and females, which of course is completely
dominated by the males, since they constitute over 90% of the sample). This ﬂaw has a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the
predicted fraction of female faculty (the predicted fraction goes up when the analysis is performed taking the
diﬀering age distributions properly into account).

To perform a detailed analysis that corrects both of these problems, the author began with an examination
of the departmental web pages of the ‘top 50’ physics universities, as ranked by the National Research Council
(NRC) [4]. These universities produce the majority of BSc’s and PhD’s in America. Most of the departmental
web pages contained biographical data (ie; year and institute of PhD, etc) of their faculty members. In this
study astronomers were excluded because they have a diﬀerent fraction of women participating in the ﬁeld than
other areas of physics. Adjunct, visiting, research, and aﬃliated professors were also excluded. The study also
excluded faculty members who had received their degree from a non-American institution.

Of 1743 faculty members at the ‘top 50’ universities that were ultimately examined, 101 were female, and a

total of 1425 had available biographical data.

To obtain the predicted fraction of female professors from this data, we begin with the number of PhD’s
granted each year to both males and females in America [5] (see Figure 1). We then work out the probability
that a male in a particular PhD graduating class will be a professor at one of the ‘top 50’ universities in 2005; we
do this by dividing the year-of-PhD distribution of male professors with the distribution of the number of male
PhD’s graduating each year. If the leaky pipeline does not exist, the female ‘be-a-professor-in-2005’ probability
will be exactly the same as for the males in each graduating class.

In this manner, we obtain a prediction of the number of female professors we expect to see at the ‘top 50’

universities in 2005.

Figure 2 shows the actual probability versus year-of-PhD that a female physicist will be a faculty member at
one of the ‘top 50’ universities in 2005. The histogram indicates the predicted distribution, obtained assuming
that females have the same relative probability of being a professor in 2005 as males from the same graduating
class. The actual distribution is systematically lower than the predicted distribution.

Figure 3 shows the year-of-PhD distributions of female assistant, associate, and full professors. The histograms
again indicate the predicted distribution, obtained assuming that females and males from the same graduating
class have the same relative probability of being a professor in 2005. Figure 4 shows the year-of-PhD distributions
of all female professors. Every point in the actual distribution is lower than the predicted.

Based on this data, the predicted fractions of female faculty members at the ‘top 50’ universities are
0.129,0.104, and 0.052 at the assistant, associate, and full faculty levels, respectively. The observed fractions
are 0.107, 0.109, 0.043, respectively.

It is interesting to note that the fraction of female associate professors is actually higher than predicted.
However, Figure 4 shows an overall depletion of professors for years-of-PhD 1984 and onwards. It thus appears
that the excess may well be due to women languishing longer at the associate professorship level than their male
peers (ie; the excess probably reﬂects a ‘clog’ in the academic pipeline at the associate professor level).

The overall observed number of women faculty is about 15% less than expected, and the depletion is statistically

signiﬁcant at a level of 1.7 standard deviations.

I. CONCLUSION

3

This study ﬁnds the leaky pipeline phenomenon exists for women past the postdoctoral level at a level of
around 15%. Some may wonder if this is a big enough leak to be a problem. In human terms, however, a 15%
leak means that we are missing one out of six women who, in an equitable society, would have been physics
faculty members. There are so few women at the faculty level in physics, that losing one out of every six is in
fact a serious concern. Especially if we think about what it must take to convince someone to leave a ﬁeld when,
by that point in their careers, they have committed their working lives to physics, and have gone through at
least a decade of higher education to get there.

Not all women who become physics faculty members have experienced gender discrimination during their
careers. However, many do, and it is unfortunate that the combination of gender discrimination and a ‘glass
ceiling’ phenomenon in the ﬁeld is preventing more women from becoming physics faculty members.

The author is an experimental particle physicist, and has observed over the years the serious obstacles that her
female colleagues have had to face as they try to advance in the ﬁeld. There is indeed widespread discrimination
against many women in physics, and women with children seem to be particularly vulnerable; for instance, the
author is personally acquainted with three female physicists who, after having children, had to work for free or a
substantially reduced rate compared to their peers, simply to remain in the ﬁeld. The only other choice available
to them was to simply drop out of the academic pipeline all together. Conversely, the author knows literally
hundreds of male physicists past the doctoral level, but is not aware of a single male who has had their pay cut
oﬀ or substantially reduced for any reason.

Given some of the chilling incidents of discrimination against females that the author has personally observed
to transpire within physics academia, it is somewhat surprising that the relative leak of females in the academic
pipeline past the postdoctoral level is only 15%. A male colleague once mentioned to the author that he felt
very sorry for many of his female colleagues in physics because he felt the message that they were persistently
given was that ‘Yes! the good news is that you can succeed in physics as a female! (you just need to be prepared
to chew your own leg oﬀ to do so)’.

Tragically, some of the women who have ultimately made it to the faculty level likely did have to ‘chew their
own leg oﬀ’ to get there. Even more tragically, their stories are almost never told because they (quite rightly)
fear repercussions to their career if they speak out. The chilly climate that removes one out of every six female
potential physics faculty members needs to be changed if particpation of women in physics is to be increased at
all levels.

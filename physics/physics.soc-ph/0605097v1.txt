We study the evolution of the Axelrod model for cultural diversity. We consider a simple version
of the model in which each individual is characterized by two features, each of which can assume q
possibilities. Within a mean-ﬁeld description, we ﬁnd a transition at a critical value qc between an
active state of diversity and a frozen state. For q just below qc, the density of active links between
interaction partners is non-monotonic in time and the asymptotic approach to the steady state is
controlled by a time scale that diverges as (q − qc)−1/2.

A basic feature of many societies is the tendency to
form distinct cultural domains even though individuals
may rationally try to reach agreement with acquain-
tances. The Axelrod model provides a simple yet rich
description for this dichotomy by incorporating societal
diversity and the tendency toward consensus by local in-
teractions [1]. In this model, each individual carries a set
of F characteristic features that can assume q distinct
values; for example, one’s preferences for sports, for mu-
sic, for food, etc. In an elemental update step, a pair of
interacting agents i and j is selected. If the agents do
not agree on any feature, then there is no interaction.
However, if the agents agree on at least one feature, then
another random feature is selected and one of the agents
changes its preference for this feature to agree with that
of its interaction partner. A similar philosophy of al-
lowing interactions only between suﬃciently compatible
individuals underlies related systems, such as bounded
conﬁdence [2] and constrained voter-like models [3].

Depending on the two parameters F and q, a phase
transition occurs between cultural homogeneity, where
all agents are in the same state, and diversity [1, 4, 5,
6]. The latter state could either be frozen, where no
pair of interacting agents shares any common feature,
or it could be continuously evolving if pairs with shared
features persist. The rich dynamics of the model does
not fall within the classical paradigms of coarsening in
an interacting spin system [7] or diﬀusive approach to
consensus in the voter model [8]. In this Letter, we solve
mean-ﬁeld master equations for Axelrod model dynamics
and show that the approach to the steady state is non-
monotonic and extremely slow, with a characteristic time
scale that diverges as q

qc (Figs. 1 & 2).

The emergence of an anomalously long time scale is un-
expected because the underlying master equations have
rates that are of the order of one. Another important
example of wide time-scale separation occurs in HIV [9].
After an individual contracts the disease, there is a nor-
mal immune response over a time scale of months, fol-

lowed by a latency period that can last beyond 10 years,
during which an individual’s T-cell level slowly decreases
with time. Finally, after the T-cell level falls below a
threshold value, there is a ﬁnal fatal phase that lasts 2–3
years. Our results for the Axelrod model may provide
a hint toward understanding how widely separated time
scales arise in these types of complex dynamical systems.

Following Refs. [4, 5], we describe the Axelrod model in
a minimalist way by the density Pm of bonds of type m.
These are bonds between interaction partners in which
there are m common features. This description is conve-
nient for monitoring the activity level in the system and
has the advantage of being analytically tractable. We
consider a mean-ﬁeld system in which each agent can in-
teract with a ﬁxed number of randomly-selected agents.
Agents can thus be viewed as existing on the nodes of
a degree-regular random graph. Such a topology is an
appropriate setting for cultural interaction, where both
geographically nearby and distant individuals may in-
teract with equal facility. We veriﬁed that simulations
of the Axelrod model on degree-regular random graphs
qualitatively agree with our analytical predictions, and
this agreement becomes progressively more accurate as
the number of neighbors increases (Fig. 3). Thus the
master equation approach describes the Axelrod model
when random connections between agents exist.

ordination numbers, and q = 8 states per feature. Inset: One
realization with coordination number 4.

If interaction partners share no common features (m =
0) or if all features are common (m = F ), then no inter-
action occurs across the intervening bond. Otherwise,
two agents that are connected by an active bond of type
m (with 0 < m < F ) interact with probability m/F , af-
ter which the bond necessarily becomes type m + 1. In
addition, when an agent changes a preference, the index
of all bonds attached to this agent may either increase
or decrease (Fig. 4). The competition between these di-
rect and indirect interaction channels underlies the rich
dynamics of the Axelrod model.

Because we obtain qualitatively similar behavior for

we focus on the simplest non-trivial case of F = 2. For
this example, there are three types of bonds: bonds
of type 0 (no shared features) and type 2 (all features
shared) are inert, while bonds of type 1 are active. As

where η + 1 is the network coordination number. The
ﬁrst term on the right-hand sides of Eqs. (2) and (3)
account for the direct interaction between agents i and j
that changes a bond of type 1 to type 2. For example,
in the equation for dP1
dt , a type-1 bond and the shared
feature across this bond is chosen with probability P1/2
in an update event. This update decrements the number
of type-1 bonds by one in a time dt = 1
N , where N is the
total number of sites in the system. Assembling these
factors gives the term

P1
η+1 in Eq. (2).

The remaining terms in the master equations represent
indirect interactions. For example, if agent j changes
from (a1, b2) to (a1, b1) then the bond to agent k in state
(a1, b1) changes from type 1 to type 2 (Fig. 4). The
probability for this event is proportional to P1λ/2: P1
accounts for the probability that the indirect bond is of
type 1, the factor 1/2 accounts for the fact that only the
ﬁrst feature of agents j and k can be shared, while λ is
the conditional probability that i and k share one feature
that is simultaneously not shared with j. If the distribu-

system evolves λ generally depends on the densities Pm.
Here we make an assumption of a mean-ﬁeld spirit that
λ stays constant during the dynamics [5]; this makes the
master equations tractable. Our simulations for random
graphs with large coordination number match the master
equation predictions and give λ nearly constant and close
to (q

1 (Fig. 3), thus justifying the assumption.

Since λ = λ(q) is the only parameter in the master
equations, the two stationary solutions suggest that there
is a transition at a critical value qc such that both solu-
tions apply, but on diﬀerent sides of the transition. To
locate the transition, it proves useful to relate P1 and P2
directly. Thus we divide Eq. (2) by Eq. (3) and eliminate

As a function of P2, P1 has a minimum P min

monotonically decreases as q increases and becomes neg-
ative for q larger than a critical value qc (Fig. 5). The
phase transition between the active and the frozen state
corresponds to the value of q where P1 ﬁrst reaches zero.
To ﬁnd qc, we calculate P min

For q > qc, only the upper sign is needed. For q < qc,
the upper sign applies for t < tmin and the lower sign
applies for t > tmin; here tmin is the time at which P1(t)
reaches its minimum value. Substituting back t and P1
in Eq. (10) gives the formal exact solution of Eq. (8).

The peculiar behavior of P1 as a function of time for
q below but close to the critical value qc is shown in
Fig. 2. The density of active bonds quickly decreases
with time and this decrease extends over a wide range
when q is close to qc. Thus on a linear scale, P1 remains
close to zero for a substantial time. After a minimum
value at tmin is reached, P1 then increases and ultimately
reaches a non-zero asymptotic value for q < qc. The
quasi-stationary regime where P1 remains small is deﬁned
by: (i) a time scale of the order of one that characterizes
the initial decay of P1(t), and (ii) a much longer time
scale tasymp where P1 rapidly increases and then saturates
at its steady-state value.

We can give a partial explanation for the time depen-
dence of P1. For q > qc, there are initially small enclaves
of interacting agents in a frozen discordant background.
Once these enclaves reach local consensus, they are in-
compatible with the background and the system freezes.
For q . qc (less diversity), suﬃcient active interfaces are
present to slowly and partially coarsen the system into
tortuous domains whose occupants are either compati-
ble (that is, interacting) or identical. Within a domain
of interacting agents, the active interface can ultimately
migrate to the domain boundary and facilitate merging
with other domains; this corresponds to the sharp drop in

4

P0 seen in Fig. 1 [10]. While this picture is presented in
the context of a lattice system, it remarkably still seems
to apply for degree-regular random graphs and in a mean-
ﬁeld description.

Both tmin as well as the end time of the quasi-
stationary period tasymp increase continuously and di-
verge as q approaches qc from below. To ﬁnd these diver-
gences, we expand tmin and tasymp in powers of S. From
Eq. (10), the ﬁrst two terms in the expansion of tmin, as

Abstract This paper uses two hierarchical techniques, a minimal spanning tree
and an ultrametric hierarchical tree, to extract a topological inﬂuence map for
major currencies from the ultrametric distance matrix. We ﬁnd that these two
techniques generate a deﬁned and robust scale free network with meaningful tax-
onomy, which is fundamentally diﬀerent from that obtained from stock market
topology. The topology is shown to be robust with respect to method, to time
horizon and is stable during market crises. This topology gives a guide to deter-
mining the underlying economic or regional causal relationships for individual
currencies and will prove useful to understanding the dynamics of exchange rate
price determination as part of a complex network.

1 Introduction

Hierarchical structure methods are used in ﬁnance is to ascertain the structure
of asset price inﬂuences within a market. These methods use the synchronous
correlation coeﬃcient matrix of daily diﬀerence of log prices to quantify the
pricing distance between assets in terms of the inherent hierarchical structure.
This structure will give some indication of the taxonomy of an assets’ portfolio,
and can be used to generate an asset markets’ hierarchy.

Two techniques will be used in this paper. The ﬁrst technique is the creation
of a minimal spanning tree (MST), which is a graph of a set of n elements of
the arrangement of the nodes in an ultrametric space. MST has been shown to
provide sound results for ﬁnancial assets with the resultant taxonomy displaying
meaningful clusters [1, 2, 3, 4]. MST also helps to overcome the empirical
problem of noise in a historical correlation matrix [5].

The second technique is the creation of an ultrametric hierarchical tree struc-
ture [6, 7]. This technique gives a determination of the hierarchical structure of
a network and is particularly useful for determining if hubs exist.

The structure of asset price movements is extracted by use of a synchronous
correlation coeﬃcient matrix, Aij, of daily diﬀerence of log prices. This matrix
is transformed [8] by the equation below to get the ultrametric pricing distance
between currencies. This is a superior metric as it fulﬁls the three axioms of a
metric distance [1].

d(i, j) = q2(1 − Aij)

The choice of clustering procedure has more eﬀect on the quality of clustering
than the choice of distance metric [9]. MST analysis uses the single-linkage
clustering method which builds up clusters by starting with distinct objects
and linking them based on similarity. The major issue with this method is
that while it is robust for strongly clustered networks, it has a tendency to link
poorly clustered groups into chains by successively joining them to their nearest
neighbours [10]. These chains are non-robust to data variation, and thus MST
is less robust for larger distances. The information obtained should thus be
used with care and be combined with other techniques if possible. This paper
will focus on the extraction of price inﬂuences rather than on determinants of
market activity.

2 The data

Forty-four currencies (table 1) were chosen because they were generally free
ﬂoating, covered the data period (23/10/95 - 31/12/01) and had either market
dominance or represented a region. The Mexican peso and Russian rouble were
used in their format prior to currency reforms, which removed three zeros. Data
were sourced from Oanda.com at Olsen and Associates. Daily average inter-
bank ask exchange rates as determined in Zurich. This should give some idea
of how international currencies interact, how the currency nodes are clustered,
and the pattern behind price inﬂuences. This is a small sample compared to
stock market studies, which will limit possible topologies.

3 Numeriare

One of the problems uniquely encountered in foreign exchange research is that
currencies are priced against each other so no independent numeriare exists.
Any currency chosen as a numeriare will be excluded from the results, yet its
inherent patterns can indirectly inﬂuence overall patterns. There is no standard
solution to this issue or a standard numeriare candidate. Gold was considered,
but rejected due to its high volatility.

This is an important problem as diﬀerent numeriare will give diﬀerent results
if strong multidimensional cross-correlations are present. Diﬀerent bases can
also generate diﬀerent tree structures. The inclusion or exclusion of currencies
from the sample can also give diﬀerent results. This implies samples should
include all major currencies and undue emphasis should not be placed on any
particular MST result. Result robustness should also be checked by comparison
with other methods or samples.

This study used both the NZD and the USD as numeriare. The NZD is a
minor currency which can be easily excluded, and it does not impose any strong
default pattern. However the overwhelming dominance of the US dollar tends
to submerge secondary inﬂuences. Use of the US dollar as the numeriare allows
second-order relationships to be examined, as the MST will show diﬀerences

in price inﬂuence. The results are indicative only however as the exclusion of
the US dollar can impose a default pattern due to cross-correlations. A larger
sample size was used for the US dollar tests to allow regional clusters to be
developed.

An alternative approach to MST graphs is the use of all currency pairs [3].
This is a valid approach but it does add more complexity, gives visual results
which are diﬃcult to interpret, as well as potentially missing out inﬂuential
currencies. The approach is also impractical if additional causal links in addition
to the primary link are examined, or if the sample size is larger than ten. There
are also problems caused by the impact on correlations of cross-quotations, as
this imposes a default structure.

4 Results from total period NZD matrix

The NZD based distance-metric matrix indicated similarity in currency dynam-
ics between NLG-BEF 0.1743, NLG-FRF 0.1805 and BEF-FRF 0.2125. Sur-
prisingly DEM is not close to any of the ERM countries, but it is reasonably
close to the MYR 0.5191. MYR-SGD 0.6888 was the only close currency pair
in SE Asia ’SEA’, though inter-Asian values tend to be lower than intra-Asian.
The minimum spanning tree ’MST’, shown in Figure 1, was created using
Pajek c(cid:13) [11] and Kruskal’s algorithm. The star like structure indicates the USD
is the predominant world currency, and the hub of an international cluster with
only the ERM cluster separate. As noted, the DEM is not part of the ERM
cluster or directly linked to the USD. It is instead closely linked to the MYR.
Inter-SEA FX linkages are stronger than in other (non-ERM) regions, with the
IDR is linked via the MYR, and THB and PHP linked to the SGD. The GBP
links to the USD in preference to the ERM and the AUD links via its commodity
cousin, the CAD. Two other commodity currencies are also linked, the BRL and
the CLP.

The key determinant European currency is the NLG with the inter-cluster
linkage via the USD-DKK. It is of interest that currencies which are isolated,
like the RUB or the IRR, still have the USD as their main determinant link.
The MST was robust to excluded currencies, with these either being USD linked
or ERM linked. Further studies using annual data indicated no change in the
basic topology.

Our results show a more centralised arrangement than the US stock market.
The distribution of links per node is more centralised than a power-law would
dictate. An ln-ln plot of link density had a slope of 0.8, indicating a strong
element of self-organisation in the international ﬁnancial system. These results
imply that either currencies are all linked by common economic factors or cur-
rency traders pay more attention to USD movements than to local factors. The
spread of most distance values in the 0.8 to 1.16 range also reinforces the point
that price setting in currency markets is generally more homogeneous than price
setting in stock markets. The DJ and the S&P 500 indexes in contrast during
1989-1995 had a closest distance of 0.949, with most in the 1.09 to 1.3 range

[1]. Stock indices were also more web-like structure with four distinct clusters
for the DJIA, 16 major clusters for the S&P with 44 minor clusters, and 18 key
stocks acting as linkages between S&P clusters. Similar results topology was
found for stocks on the Nasdaq, NYSE and AMEX [2, 12], with a power-law
with degree 2.2 for the distribution of links per node, and the non-random na-
ture of the MST remained remarkably consistent over time. Onnela [14] found
a more structured star-based network for the S&P 500 index.

The hierarchical tree of the subdominant ultrametric space associated with

the MST is shown in Figure 2.

The smoothness of the hierarchical tree shows the dominance of the USD,
as all currencies aside from the ERM cluster and the DEM-MYR-SGD triage
link oﬀ the main tree. The large distances involved for IRR, GHC, DZD and
RUB show them to be largely isolated.

5 Results from total period USD matrix

The USD based distance-metric matrix showed weaker links than for the NZD
matrix, with a number of links close to the no-relationship value. This is ex-
pected as these are secondary inﬂuences, and some currencies may not have
inﬂuential secondary linkages. Note that care is needed when interpreting sec-
ond order trees as relationships can be created indirectly by a joint association
to the missing hub, the USD, rather than a direct relationship. Results should
thus be checked against economic reasons or against other samples or methods.

Figure 2: NZD-based FX hierarchical tree of subdominant ultrametric space
1995-2001. Hierarchical grouping of distances metrics for currencies quoted
against the NZD. This gives clusters, based on primary causal link. This shows
that price determination leads oﬀ the USD with Asian and ERM clusters.

The USD based minimum spanning tree, Figure 3, shows more clustering
than the NZD MST star diagram, with groups nested within other groups.
Visually relationships overall seem weaker, though the ERM hub still exists.
This hub is stable as dropping out the USD does not aﬀect price causation. The
removal of the USD has, however, aﬀected most other currency relationships.
The GBP is now showing its second order link to the ERM as is the DZD.
There is also a minor Scandinavian grouping. The distribution of node links of
the USD MST is more varied than the NZD MST, with an approximate power-
law distribution of degree 1.5 (R2 = 0.95). Further studies using annual data
indicated no change in the basic topology.

The MST has a number of dangling pendants. While these need to be treated
with caution, as discussed, there does tend to be economic causation behind
most of the linkages. The strongest economic clusters are the two commodity
clusters. The ﬁrst is the AUD, CAD, ZAR, SAR cluster. The AUD is conven-
tionally used in currency markets as a play on commodity prices. The linking
of the commodity economies to the AUD lends support to this convention.

Another commodity cluster is grouped around the CLP (copper, various);
COP (oil), RUB (oil, various), BOB (copper), GHC (copper) and JMD (baux-
ite). The Indian subcontinent currencies of PKR and BDT are also weakly
linked. The MXN-PLN link of this cluster back to the ERM involves long dis-
tances so maybe spurious. The distance involved with the RUB link indicates
it is also isolated. The BOB, PKR and BDT links are problematic as they were
pegged to the USD for part of the data period and have thin markets.

The link between the ERM cluster and the rest of the world is via the NLG-
CZK-DEM-MYR link, which provides the backbone to the system. A SE Asian
cluster is evident, centred on the MYR and linked via the DEM. The SGD seems

to be linked externally instead of inter-Asean as illustrated by its JPY link. The
SGD/ KES link and the PHP/QAR link are probably spurious.

The associated hierarchical tree of the sub-dominant ultrametric space, Fig-
ure 4, shows three main secondary clusters, the ERM, with low distances, the
North/SE Asian, with medium distances, and the Latin American/South Asian
grouping. Outside those clusters distances tend to be high, indicating ties are
weak. The tree indicates the AUD based commodity cluster is part of the
dominant USD/ERM hierarchy rather than an isolated cluster. Conversely the
hierarchical tree indicates that the Latin American-South Asian cluster is iso-
lated from the main tree, and has a separate price determinate process, though
inter-region linkages are weak. There is no separate South-Asia cluster.

6 Asian crisis period (1997/98)

The techniques were repeated for the Asian crisis period, 1st August 1997 to
31st October 1998. The rationale is that several empirical studies have indicated
that causal determination behind currency movements diﬀers during crisis pe-
riods and non-crisis periods with regional correlations tending towards unity.
It is useful to verify these results with MST analysis, as this may aid our un-
derstanding of cluster dynamics during market crises. The results can also be
compared to the topological crisis studies which show a universal shortening of
distance in stock markets [5, 13, 15] and FX [16].

Both the NZD and the USD distance-metric matrices show correlations
within SE Asia increased during the crisis period, in most cases by 50 to100%,

approximating inter-ERM correlations. North Asian currencies had lower dis-
tances to SE Asian currencies during the crisis period. Several non-Asian cur-
rencies BDT, BRL, RUB and GBP, also became more strongly linked to the
SE Asian currencies during the crisis. All Asian crisis-aﬀected currencies also
became more strongly linked to USD. In contrast to these results inter-ERM
distances increased, indicating stress. These results may imply that currency
traders started to treat the crisis countries as a distinct bloc during the period
of the crisis.

While these results provide support for the hypothesis that crisis aﬀected
countries formed a closely tied cluster, these conclusions need to be treated with
care as the decrease in distances of all the aﬀected countries to the USD raises
the alternative hypothesis of an increase in power of the USD in price setting.
The crisis-aﬀected countries could thus be seen as individually increasing their
joint co-movement against the USD, and only indirectly moving together.

These changes are illustrated in the crisis period NZD-based minimum span-
ning tree, shown in Figure 5. The total period two-cluster network shown in
Figure 1 is still retained during the crisis period. The ERM cluster is largely
unchanged, though the distances are increased and the GBP and JPY have
been picked up. The USD cluster structure is also largely unchanged though
some relative distances have changed. In particular the RUB is now closer to
the USD. The Asian oﬀshoot is retained but now the THB is the key currency
with MXN and SKW now linked. This indicates the eﬀect of the crisis on those
currencies.

The similarity of ﬁgure 5 to ﬁgure 1 indicates that channels for crisis prop-
agation were activities within the USD hub impacting on one country after
another, instead of one currency directly aﬀecting another. These conclusions

are strengthened by examination of the hierarchical tree of the subdominant ul-
trametric space, shown in Figure 6. This tree shows despite decreased distances
within Asia and increased ERM distances, there are still only two dominant
clusters. The pattern of network clustering is unaltered. The only noticeable
change is that previously isolated currencies, like the RUB, IRR or GHC, are
now integrated.

Figure 7: Crisis Period FX USD-based minimum spanning tree 1997-98. Graph-
ical representation of minimal distance metrics for crisis period of currencies
quoted against the USD. The major diﬀerence from Figure 3 is the increased
centrality of the Asian cluster.

These conclusions are reinforced by the hierarchical tree of the subdominant
ultrametric space Figure 8. The ERM cluster is still present and the Asian-based
cluster is weakened, with only the DEM-MYR-SGD triage present. Other Asian
currencies tend to co-move with this triage only as part of a global currency co-
movement. Most non-ERM-Asian currencies have weak distances. The Latin-
American/ South Asian cluster has disappeared. The overall impression is of
less regional clustering during the crisis and more of a common global cluster,
especially outside the ERM.

7 Conclusions

This paper has shown that price determination in international currency markets
displays sparse clustering. Information has been extracted which can form the
basis of a network topology. The network has a simple tree-like structure with
a dominant spine. Underneath the predominant inﬂuence of the USD and the
ERM, there are clear secondary relationships based on economic or regional
factors. This topology was shown to be robust to time horizon and market
crises. The paper also indicates that the transmission process for cascading

spine.

Overall the results also provide an indication that the price determination
structure of international currency markets is tree like and sparsely clustered.
This implies dynamic behaviour related to complex networks can be applied to
currency markets.

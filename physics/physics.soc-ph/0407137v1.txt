We study the statistics of citations from all Physical Review journals for the 110-year period
1893 until 2003. In addition to characterizing the citation distribution and identifying publications
with the highest citation impact, we investigate how citations evolve with time. There is a positive
correlation between the number of citations to a paper and the average age of citations. Citations
from a publication have an exponentially decaying age distribution; that is, old papers tend to not
get cited. In contrast, the citations to a publication are consistent with a power-law age distribution,
with an exponent close to −1 over a time range of 2 – 20 years. We also identify a number of strongly-
correlated citation bursts and other dramatic features in the time history of citations to individual
publications.

I.

INTRODUCTION

In this article, we study quantitative features of the
complete set of citations for all publications in Physi-
cal Review (PR) journals from the start of the journal
in July 1893 until June 2003 [1]. This corpus provides
a comprehensive dataset from which we can learn many
interesting statistical facts about scientiﬁc citations. An
especially useful aspect of this data is that it encompasses
a continuous span of 110 years, and thus provides a broad
window with which to examine the time evolution of cita-
tions and the citation history of individual publications.
The quantitative study of citations has a long history
in bibliometrics, a subﬁeld of library and information sci-
ence (see e.g., [2] for a general introduction and [3, 4, 5]
for leads into this literature). The ﬁrst study of citations
by physicists was apparently made by Price [6], in which
he built upon the original Simon model [7] to conclude
that the distribution of citations had a power-law form.
It is also worth mentioning much earlier work by Lotka
[8] and by Shockley [9] on the distribution of the number
of publications by individual scientists. In the context of
citations, Price termed the mechanism for a power-law ci-
tation distribution as cumulative advantage, in that that
rate at which a paper gets cited could be expected to
be proportional to its current number of citations. This
mechanism is now known as preferential attachment [10]
in the framework of growing network models.

Recently, larger studies of citation statistics were per-
formed that made use of datasets that became available
from the Institute for Scientiﬁc Information (ISI) [11]
and from the SPIRES database [12]. Based on data for
top-cited authors, the citation distribution for individu-
als was argued to have a stretched exponential form [13].
On the other hand, by analyzing a dataset of 783,339 pa-
pers from all ISI-cataloged journals and all 24,296 papers
in Physical Review D from 1975 until 1994, a power-law

citation distribution was inferred [14], with an exponent
of −3 that coincided with subsequent predictions from
idealized networks that grow by preferential attachment
[10, 15, 16, 17]. This result was also in accord with the
original expectation from Price’s original work [6]. Fi-
nally, it is worth mentioning two current statistical stud-
ies of collaborations among authors that are based on a
diverse set of articles from MEDLINE, arXiv.org, NC-
STRL, and SPIRES [18], and set of mathematics and
neuroscience articles [19].

This work is focused on the citation statistics of indi-
vidual articles. While the total number of PR citations
contained in our study is less than half of what was pre-
viously considered in Ref. [14] (approximately 3.1 million
vs. 6.7 million), the new data encompasses 110 years of
citations from what is arguably the most prominent set
of archival physics journals after 1945. Thus we are able
to uncover a variety of new features associated with the
time history of citations. These include highly correlated
bursts of citations, well-deﬁned trends, and, conversely,
downturns in research activity.

It is important to be aware that citation data from a
single journal, even one as central as Physical Review,
has signiﬁcant omissions. As we shall discuss in the con-
cluding section, the ratio of the number of internal ci-
tations (cites to a PR papers by other PR publications;
this dataset) to total citations (cites to a PR paper by all
publications) is as small as 1/5 for well-cited elementary-
particle physics publications. It is reasonable to expect
that a similar ratio of internal to total citations also oc-
curs for typical PR publications. The existence of so
many citations from publications outside PR journals
could alter some of the generic citation histories that we
shall present.

There are also many famous papers that did not ap-
pear in PR journals, as well as highly-cited authors that
typically did not publish in PR journals. This tension
between PR and non-PR journals has been inﬂuenced by
global socioeconomic factors, as well as, more recently,
by opportunistic considerations, such as changes in page
charge policies and the creation of electronic archives and

electronic journals. All these factors serve to caution the
reader that the primary observations of this study are
only a partial glimpse into the true citation impact of
physics research publications.

expect, highly-cited papers are long-lived. Conversely,
for papers with only young citations, the number of ci-
tations is typically small. For example, for publications
(before 2000) in which the average citation age is less
than 2 years, the average number of citations is 3.55.

II. CITATION DATA

A. General Facts

The data provided by the Physical Review Editorial
Oﬃce covers the period 1893 (the start of the journal)
through June 30, 1993. The data is in the following list
form (with PRB = Phys. Rev. B, PRE = Phys. Rev. E,
PRL = Phys. Rev. Lett., RMP = Rev. Mod. Phys., etc.):

PRB 19 1203 1979 | PRB 20 4044 1979
PRB 19 1203 1979 | PRB 22 1096 1980
PRB 19 1213 1979 | PRB 27 380 1983
PRB 19 1225 1979 | PRB 24 714 1981
PRB 19 1225 1979 | PRL 55 2991 1985
PRB 19 1225 1979 | PRB 38 3075 1988
PRB 19 1225 1979 | RMP 63 63 1991
PRB 19 1225 1979 | PRE 62 6989 2000

To the left of the vertical line is the cited paper and to
the right is the citing paper. In the above sample, Phys.
Rev. B 19, 1225 (1979) was cited 5 times, once each in
1981, 1985, 1988, 1991, and 2000. There are 3,110,839
citations in the complete data set and the number of
distinct publications that have at least one citation is
329,847. There are a total of 353,268 publications [20],
so that only 6.6% of all PR publications are uncited; this
is much smaller than the 47% fraction of uncited papers
in the ISI dataset [14]. The average number of citations
for all PR publications is 8.806. We emphasize again that
this dataset does not include citations to or from papers
outside of PR journals.

There are a variety of amusing basic facts about this
citation data. The 329,847 publications with at least 1
citation may be broken down as follows:

11 publications with > 1000 citations
79 publications with > 500 citations
237 publications with > 300 citations
2,340 publications with > 100 citations
8,073 publications with > 50 citations
245,459 publications with < 10 citations
5 citations
178,019 publications with <
1 citation
84,144 publications with

For studying the time history of citations, we deﬁne
the age of a citation as the diﬀerence in the year that a
citation occurred and the publication year of the cited
paper. For all PR publications, the average citation age
in 6.2 years. On the other hand, for papers with more
than 100 citations, the average citation age is 11.7 years.
The average age climbs to 14.6 years for publications with
more than 300 citations and 18.9 years for the 11 pub-
lications with more than 1000 citations. As one might

B. Accuracy

Because citation data is larger generated by individual
authors, A natural concern is accuracy of this data. In
recent years, cross-checking mechanisms have been insti-
tuted by the Physical Review Editorial Oﬃce to promote
accuracy. In older papers, however, a variety of citation
errors exist [21]. One can get a sense of their magni-
tude by looking at the reference lists of old PR papers
in the on-line PR journals (prola.aps.org). References
to PR papers that are not hyperlinked typically are er-
roneous (exceptions are citations to proceedings of old
APS meetings, where the page of the cited article gen-
erally does not match the hyperlinked ﬁrst page of the
proceedings section). By scanning through a representa-
tive set of publications, one will see that such citations
are occasional but not rare.

While author-generated citation errors, caused by care-
lessness or propagation of erroneous citations, are hard
to detect systematically, the following types of errors are
easily determined:

1. Old citations are potentially suspect. A typical ex-
ample occurs when author(s) meant to cite, for ex-
ample, Phys. Rev. B 2, xxx (1970), but instead
cited Phys. Rev. 2, xxx (1913). There are 14807
citations older than 50 years in the initial dataset,
with 4734 of these to a publication with a single
citation, a feature that suggests an erroneous ci-
tation. By looking every hundredth of these 4734
citations, 39 out of 47 (≈ 83%) were in fact incor-
rect. The accuracy rate improves to approximately
50% for the 606 papers with 2 citations and pre-
sumably becomes progressively more accurate for
publications with a larger number of citations.

2. Citations to pages beyond the total number of
pages in the cited volume. This type of error par-
tially overlaps with item 1. In vols. 1–80 of Phys.
Rev. (until 1950), there are 4152 such errors out of
125,240 citations.

3. Acausal citations; that is, a citation to a publica-
tion in the future. There are 1102 such errors.

4. Truncated page numbers. In PR issues after 2001,
papers are identiﬁed by a six-digit number that be-
gins with a leading “0”, rather than a conventional
page number. This leading digit was sometime not
included.

3

feature is that the long-term growth rate of citations is
smaller after WWII than before. The very recent decay
in cited publications occurs because such citations have
not yet been completed. Finally, notice also that area
under the two curves must be the same.

5. Page numbers in vols. 133–139 of Phys. Rev. were
prepended by an A or B, a convention that fostered
citation errors (see Sec. IV on most-cited papers).

6. Two papers were referred to at once, e.g., PRL 33,
100, 300, (1990) when the lazy authors should have
cited PRL 33, 100, (1990) and PRL 33, 300 (1990).

Additionally, there were easily-correctable mechanical

defects in the original data. These include:

1. For volumes in which number of journal pages
exceeded 10,000, the comma in the page num-
ber sometimes appeared as a non-standard charac-
ter. The number of such errors was approximately
10,000.

2. Some lines contained either html or related markup

language, or other unusual characters.

3. Annotated page numbers. For example, citations
to the same paper could appear as PRE 10, 100
(1990) and PRE 10, 100(R) (1990). Annotations
included (a), A, (A), (b), B, (B), (BR), (e), E, (E),
L, (L), R, (R), [R], (T), (3), (5). Many have clear
meanings (letter, erratum, as well as (A), A, and
(a) for meeting notes in the early APS years), while
other seem to be meaningless. The number of such
lines was approximately 1500.

In summary,

the number of “obvious” author-
generated citation errors that could be identiﬁed in an
automated matter is of the order of 10,000, an error rate
of approximately 1
3 %. The number of non-obvious er-
rors, i.e., citations where the volume, page number, and
publication year are not manifestly wrong, is likely much
higher. However, upon perusal of subsets of the data, it
appears that the total error rate is of the order of a few
percent, and is considerably smaller in recent years, even
as the overall publication rate has increased. With these
caveats, we now analyze the citation data to learn basic
features of the citation distribution and related quanti-
ties.

One basic aspect of citations is their rapid growth in
time (Fig. 1), a feature that mirrors the growth of PR
journals themselves. This growth needs to be accounted
for in any realistic modeling of the distribution of scien-
tiﬁc citations (see e.g., [22]). The number of citations
by citing papers published in a given year is shown as
the dashed curve, and the number of citations to cited
papers that were published in a given year is shown as
the solid curve. Notice the signiﬁcant drop in citations
during the period of World War II. The fact that the two
curves are so closely correlated during WWII (and indeed
throughout most of the past century) indicates that most
citations are to very recent papers. Another noteworthy

FIG. 2: Normalized citation distributions for all papers in
Phys. Rev. from 1893 to 2003 (◦) and from the ISI dataset
(∆). The latter include papers published in 1981 that were
cited between 1981 and 1997 (from Ref. [14]).

We next show the citation distribution for the entire
dataset (Fig. 2). This distribution is visually similar to
that in Ref. [14] for the corresponding ISI distribution.
While there is systematic curvature in the data on a dou-
ble logarithmic scale, a Zipf plot of the ISI data, which
focuses on the large-citation tail, suggested a power-law
form for the citation distribution [14]. A similar conclu-
sion for the citation distribution can thus be expected for

the PR data. A straightforward power-law ﬁt to the data
in the range of 50 – 300 citations gives an exponent of
−2.55 for both the PR and ISI data; however, as argued
in Ref. [14] by using a Zipf plot, the exponent of the ISI
citation distribution is consistent with the value −3

FIG. 3: Normalized citation distributions in selected years.

To check if the nature of the citation distribution is
aﬀected by the growth of PR journals, we plot in Fig. 3
the normalized citation distribution to papers published
in selected years, along with the normalized total cita-
tion distribution. We see that these yearly distributions
closely match the total distribution except at the large-
citation tail. There is also a hint that the form of the
citation distribution for small number of citations (. 20)
is qualitatively diﬀerent than the rest of the distribution.
A natural suspicion is that self-citations might play a sig-
niﬁcant role because papers with few citations are likely
to be predominantly self-cited.

IV. RANKING BY CITATION IMPACT

4

One feature of citations that attracts general inter-
est is the identity of highly-cited papers. To decide on
which papers are most inﬂuential, we argue that a rank-
ing based on only the number of citations does not dis-
tinguish between publications that are heavily cited for
a short period and those cited over many decades. While
the former history might arise from major discoveries,
it could also arise from incorrect results, transitory sub-
jects, or papers that are “ﬁrst to be second” in a ﬁeld.
Thus a more useful measure of the impact of a publi-
cation should involve both the number of citations to a
publication and the average age of these citations. We
deﬁne the product of these two quantities as the citation
impact of a paper.

A top-100 list based on this citation impact ranking is
given below. Also tabulated are the number of citations
to each publication and the average age of these citations,
with both measures determined as of June 2003. The ear-
liest paper on this list was published in 1929 and the most
recent in 1986. By decades, the number of papers in the
top-100 list are: (1920’s – 1, 1930’s – 10, 1940’s – 9, 1950’s
– 28, 1960’s – 30, 1970’s – 13, and 1980’s – 9). There are
two individuals who have co-authored ﬁve papers on this
top-100 list: W. Kohn, who occupies positions 1, 2, 24,
96, and 100, and P. W. Anderson (positions 9, 19, 20, 35,
& 41). Papers by E. P. Wigner appear four times (4, 8,
53, & 55), and papers by L. Onsager (16, 64, & 68) and
by J. C. Slater (12, 27, & 40) each appear three times.
Individuals with two publications include J. Bardeen,
C. P. Bean, R. H. Dicke, R. J. Glauber, D. R. Hamann,
P. Hohenberg, J. M. Luttinger, Y. Nambu, E. M. Pur-
cell, M. Schl¨uter, J. Schwinger, G. H. Wannier, and
J. A. Wheeler.

The entries with asterisks in Table I denote publica-
tions in those issues of PR with the prepended A or B on
the page numbers. For these publications, the following
citations had omitted the prepended A or B:

Phys. Rev. 140, A1133 (1965): 123 out of 3227 total
Phys. Rev. 136, B864 (1964): 120 out of 2640 total
Phys. Rev. 139, A796 (1965): 14 out of 416 total
Phys. Rev. 135, A640 (1964): 19 out of 348 total
Phys. Rev. 140, A1197 (1964): 21 out of 322 total

Our use of citation impact as the criterion for a top-
100 list, handicaps more recent highly-cited publications,
where the citation age is necessarily small. We therefore

provide below all the remaining 33 PR publications with
more than 500 citations that did not qualify for the initial
top-100 list. The citation rank of each of these publica-
tions is also given. In addition to tabulating citations up
to June 2003, we also provide the citations as of June
2004. There is a wide variation in the current rate of ci-
tations; while one publication has a single citation in the
past year, another has more than 150. Based on these
citation rates, several of the articles listed here should
soon displace publications in the initial top-100 list.

V. CITATION HISTORY

The citation histories of well-cited publications show a
variety of intriguing features. As mentioned in Sec. II, a
paper generally needs to have a long lifetime to be highly
cited. Exceptions to this pattern have arisen in recent
years, and appear to be fueled, in part, by more rapid
dissemination of results and by an increased propensity

for trend-following behavior. The most prominent ex-
ample is the ﬁeld of high-temperature superconductivity,
where several highly-cited publications from the late 80’s
were cited more than 500 times within ﬁve years.

Another basic fact is that the citation histories of
highly-cited papers are extremely diverse. Several illus-
trative and generic examples are shown in Figs. 4 & 5.
The paper with most citations in all PR journals is “Self-
Consistent Equations Including Exchange and Correla-

tion Eﬀects”, Phys. Rev. 140, A1133 (1965) by W. Kohn
& L. J. Sham (KS), with 3227 citations as of June 2003.
It is amazing that citations to this publication have been
steadily increasing for nearly 40 years. Another note-
worthy example is “Interaction between the d-Shells in
the Transition Metals. II. Ferromagnetic Compounds of
Manganese with Perovskite Structure”, Phys. Rev. 82,
403 (1951), by C. Zener (Z). Although this paper has
“only” 678 citations through the end of 2003, the bulk of
its citations occurred nearly 50 years after publication!
The citation spike around the year 2000 is a consequence
of a resurgence of interest in colossal magnetoresistance,
to be discussed in more detail in Sec. VII.

FIG. 5: Citation history of six, more recent highly-cited pub-
lications identiﬁed by author initials or by topic (see text).

Shown also are the citation histories of “Can Quantum-
Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Consid-

ered Complete?”, Phys. Rev. 47, 777 (1935) by A. Ein-
stein, B. Podolsky, & N. Rosen (EPR) and “Theory
of Superconductivity”, Phys. Rev. 108, 1175 (1957) by
J. Bardeen, L. N. Cooper, & J. R. Schrieﬀer (BCS). EPR
had 82 citations before 1990 and 515 citations subse-
quently – 597 citations in total at the end of 2003. The
longevity of EPR is the reason for the appearance of this
publication on the top-100 citation impact list. The cur-
rent interest in EPR stems from the revival of work on
quantum information phenomena (see Sec. VII).
In a
similar vein, the citation history of BCS peaked in the
60’s, followed by a steady decay through the mid-80’s,
with a minimum in the number of citations in 1985, the
year before the discovery of high-temperature supercon-
ductivity. It is worth emphasizing that BCS is the ﬁrst
PR publication with more than 1000 citations (with 1388
citations at the end of 2003).

Fig. 5 illustrates the diversity of citation histories for
several more recent publications. The paper, “A Model of
Leptons”, Phys. Rev. Lett. 19, 1264 (1967), by S. Wein-
berg, was a major advance in the electroweak theory
(1311 citations at the end of 2003; #18 in impact rank),
and the citation history follows what one might naively
anticipate – a peak, as beﬁtting a major discovery, fol-
lowed by a slow decay. Parenthetically, the same cita-
tion history occurs for the related paper “Weak Interac-
tions with Lepton-Hadron Symmetry”, Phys. Rev. D 2,
1285 (1970) by S. L. Glashow, J. Iliopoulos, & L. Maiani
(742 citations at the end of 2003; #73 in impact rank).
In contrast, “Scaling Theory of Localization: Absence
of Quantum Diﬀusion in Two Dimensions”, Phys. Rev.
Lett. 42, 673 (1979) by E. Abrahams, P. W. Anderson,
D. C. Licciardello, & T. V. Ramakrishnan (the “gang of
four”, G4; #35 in impact rank) has been cited between
40 - 60 times nearly every year since publication. Given
the seminal nature and the ensuing research spawned by
these three publications, it is paradoxical that the rate of
citations to the former two have decayed so signiﬁcantly.
Another set of amusing examples include the two pub-
lications that announced the discovery of the J/ψ par-
ticle – Phys. Rev. Lett. 33, 1404 & 1406 (1974). The
citation histories of these two publications are essentially
identical and could only be characterized as supernovae.
The publication “Bose-Einstein Condensation in a Gas
of Sodium Atoms”, Phys. Rev. Lett. 75, 3969 (1995) by
K. B. Davis, M.-O. Mewes, M. R. Andrews, N. J. van
Druten, D. S. Durfee, D. M. Kurn, & W. Ketterle (BEC)
also has a strongly-peaked citation history (but less ex-
treme than the J/ψ papers), as beﬁts an important dis-
covery in a quickly evolving ﬁeld. Many well-recognized
papers that report major discoveries have such a sharply-
peaked citation history.

Finally, we show the citation history of “Eﬃcient Pseu-
dopotentials for Plane-Wave Calculations”, Phys. Rev. B
43, 1993 (1991) by N. Troullier & J. L. Martins (TM).
This publication has the same citation pattern as the
Kohn-Sham paper, but with a compressed time scale and
an ampliﬁed citation scale. Based on its past decade of ci-

tations, this paper appears destined to have a signiﬁcant
citation impact. Several more examples of this exception
type of citation pattern will be identiﬁed and discussed
in Sec. VII.

VI. AGE CHARACTERISTICS OF CITATIONS

One of the more useful aspects of having 110 years of
citation data is the ability to study their age structure.
In theoretical modeling of growing networks, it was found
that the combined age-degree distribution of the nodes in
a network provide many useful structural insights about
networks [17, 23]. Here, the degree of a node – the num-
ber of links attached to this node – plays the role of the
number of citations in the underlying citation network.

systematic portion of the data, power-law ﬁts suggest
that hAi ∼ N α, with α ≈ 0.28 for all publications and
α ≈ 0.17 for dead publications.

As previously alluded to in Sec. III, there are two dis-
tinct distributions of citation ages. One is the distribu-
tion of citation ages from citing publications (Fig. 7).
This refers to the age (years in the past) of each citation
in the reference list of a paper. The second, and more
fundamental, distribution refers to the ages of citations
to cited publications (Fig. 8). For example, for a paper
published in 1980 that is subsequently cited once in 1982,
twice in 1988 and three times in 1991, the (cited) citation
age distribution has discrete peaks at 2, 8 and 11 years,
with respectively weights 1/6, 1/3, and 1/2.

FIG. 6: Average age of citations to a given paper versus num-
ber of citations to this paper. The data for all publications
(◦) are averaged over a 10-point range while the data for dead
papers (∆) are averaged over a 5-point range. The straight
lines are the best ﬁts for the range shown.

Empirically, unpopular papers are typically cited only
soon after publication (if at all) and then disappear. We
thus expect that the number of citations to a paper and
the average age of these citations are positively corre-
lated. Fig. 6 shows this average citation age versus to-
tal number of citations. We also distinguish “dead” and
“alive” papers in this plot. While it is not possible to be
deﬁnitive, we deﬁne dead papers as those with less than
50 citations and where the average age of its citations
is less than one-third the age of the paper itself. Based
on examining the actual data, our deﬁnition of dead pa-
pers appears generous, as relatively few publications that
are considered as dead by this criterion have been cited
recently.

As expected, there is a positive correlation between
the average citation age hAi and the number of times
N that a publication has been cited. The dependence
is very systematic for fewer than 100 citations, but then
ﬂuctuates strongly beyond this point. Over the more

years in past

FIG. 7: The distribution of the ages of citations contained
in the reference lists of publications that were published in
selected years. Also shown is the same distribution for the
period 1913-2002.

The distribution of citing ages is shown in Fig. 7 for
for papers published in selected years, as well as the dis-
tribution integrated over the years 1913-2002. Since the
number of old publications is a small fraction of all publi-
cations, the integrated distribution does not change per-
ceptibly whether or not earlier publications are included.
The annual distributions and the integrated distribution
are all quite similar and show the same range of memory
for old papers, independent of their publication year. Ev-
idently, citations are driven primarily by memory and not
by a preferential attachment mechanism (see Ref. [24] for
modeling a decaying memory on the structure of grow-
ing networks). Since the probability of citing a paper is
proportional to its current number of citations in prefer-
ential attachment, this would give preferential citations
to older papers – opposite to what is observed. Thus the
adage “nobody cites old papers anymore” is ﬁguratively
true for PR publications.

In the range of 2 – 15 years, the distribution decays
exponentially in time, with a 10-fold decrease in cita-
tion probability across a 20-year time span. For longer
times, there is a slower exponential memory decay that

is masked by the inﬂuence of WWII. For example for the
1972 data, there is a pronounced dip between 25 – 30
years. This dip moves 10 years earlier for each 10-year
increase in the publication year. Without this dip, the
old citation data could well exhibit data collapse. Finally,
notice that the integrated distribution has a perceptible
WWII-induced dip at 57 years in the past, indicative of
the fact that most PR publications have appeared in the
last decade.

lished in two selected years, 1952 and 1972, and as well as
the distribution integrated over 1932-1982. Once again,
this integrated distribution does not change perceptibly
if pre-1932 data are included. For plotting on a double
logarithmic scale, we also add 0.5 to all ages, so that a
citation occurring in the same year as the original paper
is assigned an age of 0.5. Over the limited range of 2 – 20
years, the integrated data is consistent with a power law
decay with an associated exponent of −0.94 (dashed line
in the ﬁgure). Thus even though authors tend to have an
exponentially-decaying memory in the publications that
they cite, the cited citation age distribution has a much
slower power law decay.

VII. CITATIONS BURSTS

Perhaps the most intriguing feature that comes to light
by looking at the time history of citations is the existence
of occasional strongly-correlated bursts of activity. We
present the most prominent examples of such bursts for
highly-cited publications, including the generic phenom-
ena of revival of classic works, “hot” publications, and
major discoveries.

FIG. 8: Distribution of the ages of citations to cited papers in
selected years, as well as the integrated data over the period
1932-1982. The dashed line is the best ﬁt to the data in the
range 2 – 20 years (displaced for visibility).

We next present the distribution of cited ages. Since
Fig. 7 suggests that citations to papers younger than 20
years are incomplete, we consider only older publications.
In fact, the cited age distribution for more recent publica-
tions has a sharp cutoﬀ when the current year is reached
because such papers are still being cited at a signiﬁcant
rate. Fig. 8 shows the age distribution for papers pub-

A. Revival of Old Classics

Sometimes a publication will remain long-unrecognized
and then suddenly become in vogue. We deﬁne this cat-
egory of publication as all non-review PR publications
(excluding RMP) with more than 300 citations and for
which the ratio of average citation age to age of the paper
is greater than 0.75. That is, we examined only well-cited
papers in which the bulk of their citations occur closer to
the present rather than to the original publication date.
Remarkably, only 8 papers ﬁt these two criteria. They
are:

FIG. 10: Citation history of the 1932 paper by Wigner (◦)
and the 1939 paper by Feynman (∆).

This number includes the aforementioned 8 articles that
also satisfy the more stringent condition of > 300 cita-
tions and also the ratio of average citation age to the age
of the publication > 0.75.

Of the 44 articles in this group, we ﬁnd three generic
citation histories. The ﬁrst is the situation already found
in the case of colossal magnetoresistance – rediscovery of
an old classic paper, but then the time in the spotlight
for such a paper passes. The second is a phenomenon
that may be characterized as publications of “enduring
interest”. These are papers that continue to be cited at
a relatively steady or slowly increasing rate over a long
time period. The third are “hot” papers, in which the
citation rate is increasing rapidly with time.

From these 44 publications, we found that 17 of them
ﬁt the citation history of revival of an old classic. They
are listed chronologically below:

The number of citations in this table have been up-
dated through the end of 2003 (compare with their cita-
tions in Table I). The clustering of citation histories of
the last 5 of these 8 publications is particularly striking
(Fig. 9). These interrelated papers were written between
1951 and 1960, with three in the same issue of Physi-
cal Review! They were all concerned with the “double
exchange” mechanism in manganites with a Perovskite
structure. This interaction is responsible for the phe-
nomenon of colossal magnetoresistance, a topic that be-
came extremely popular through the 90’s due to the con-
ﬂuence of new synthesis and measurement techniques in
thin-ﬁlm transition-metal oxides, the sheer magnitude of
the eﬀect, and the clever coining of the term “colossal”
to describe the phenomenon [26]. The simultaneous ex-
traordinary burst of citations to these articles in a short
period close to the year 2000, more than 40 years after
their original publication, is unique in the entire history
of PR journals.

FIG. 9: Citation history of the ﬁve publications of relevance
to colossal magnetoresistance.

Of the remaining three, the publications by Wigner
and by Einstein et al. owe their renewed popularity to the
upsurge of interest on quantum information phenomena.
Finally, Feynman’s work presented a new (at the time)
method for calculating forces in molecular systems, a
technique that has had wide applicability in understand-
ing interactions between elemental excitations in many
ﬁelds of physics. This paper is particularly noteworthy
because it is cited by papers from all PR journals: PR,
PRA, PRB, PRC, PRD, PRE, PRL, and RMP!

By relaxing the conditions on the number of publica-
tions and/or the ratio of average citation age to publica-
tion age, several more conﬂuences of citation activity can
be identiﬁed, although none with the intensity of that for
colossal magnetoresistance. By extending our consider-
ation to non-review articles with 200 or more citations
and with the ratio of average citation age to publication
age greater than 2/3, there are a total of 44 publications.

The reasons why these publications have faded from
citation memory generally reﬂects readily-identiﬁable
changes in current research directions. We comment on
this trend for the most highly cited publications in this
subset. Wigner’s paper is often cited in studies of cor-
related two-dimensional electron gases, quantum dots,
Wigner crystals, and related systems. These were topics
that were especially in vogue in the early 90’s, a period
that coincided with the the peak in citations to Wigner’s
paper. The Lieb & Wu paper also had a signiﬁcant ci-

tation peak in the early 90’s, where many of its citing
papers were concerned with a fashionable topic of the
time – Hubbard models, t-J models, and their oﬀshoots.
The peak in citations to Wolfenstein’s papers on neu-
trino oscillations occurred in 2000, around the same time
as the experimental announcement of these oscillations.

We next present publications of the enduring interest.
The following 12 publications ﬁt the citation history ap-
propriate for this category:

One classic example in this publication category is On-
sager’s exact solution of the two-dimensional Ising model.

The continued citations to Onsager’s paper reﬂects the

central role that the Ising model continues to play for
understanding a wide variety of cooperative phenomena.
Another important example is Schwinger’s 1951 paper
that is both a fundamental contribution to the develop-
ment of quantum electrodynamics and is also a calcula-
tional tour de force. Finally, the paper by Aharonov &
Bohm has had long-term exposure both as a textbook ex-
ample of interference eﬀects that are driven by quantum
mechanics, and as part of the current upsurge of interest
in quantum information phenomena.

B. Hot Publications

The remaining 15 out of the 44 papers could be charac-
terized as “hot”. These are publications where the cita-
tion rate is still increasing sharply and the average age of

below:

13

the citations is close to the age of the paper. It is amaz-
ing that the most-cited 1965 paper by Kohn & Sham and
the second most-cited 1964 paper by Hohenberg & Kohn
could still be characterized as hot. Another striking ex-
ample is Anderson’s 1958 publication on localization in
disordered systems, where the citation rate has had a
similar growth as the two previously-mentioned articles.
Notice also that the ﬁrst 7 of these hot publications are
on the top-100 citation impact list (Table I).

Ten of these 15 articles are in condensed-matter
physics, while 4 publications are concerned with quan-
tum information phenomena. At the rate that some of
the more recent publications on the list below are being
cited, many should soon join the initial top-100 citation
impact list.

In Fig. 11, we plot the citation history of four of the
more recent of these papers. The current citation rate
for the hottest of these hot articles is unprecedented over
the history of Physical Review.

C. Discoveries and Trend Setting

Major discoveries are often characterized by a sharp
spike in citations when the discovery becomes recognized.
We are able to readily detect the subset of such publica-
tions in which a citation spike occurs close to the time
of publication. For this identiﬁcation, we considered all

non-review articles (excluding both RMP and compila-
tions by the Particle Data Group) with more than 300
citations, in which the ratio of average citation age to age
of the publication is less than 0.4. There are a total of
39 such publications. Before 1975 most of these publica-
tions are in elementary-particle physics (22/25), while af-
ter 1984 all 14 such publications are in condensed-matter
physics. Part of the reason for this shift is that major
CERN-based discoveries in elementary-particle physics
were not published in PR journals. There has also been
a recent exodus of publications away from PR journals in
favor of web-based publications. These factors may con-
tribute as much as generational shifts in research to the

recent lack of elementary-particle physics articles among
discovery publications.

1237.7 Precision Measurements of...

From the late 50’s to the mid-70’s, the trend-setting
publications clearly reﬂected the major developments in
elementary-particle physics. These included the V −A
theory of beta decay (#2 on the list), SU (3) symmetry
(#3), CP violation (#5), current algebra methods to de-
termine mass spectra of elementary particles (#8 & 9
on the list), the role of spontaneous symmetry breaking
(#10), the development of QCD (#13 & 24), the parton
model (#15), the prediction of charm (#16), quark con-
ﬁnement and asymptotic freedom (#17–19), the “MIT
bag” model of hadrons (#20 & 25), grand uniﬁed theory
(#21), and the discovery of the J/ψ particle (#22 & 23).
Another striking feature is that of the 14 condensed-
matter physics publications after 1983, 8 of them are de-
voted to high-temperature superconductivity while an-
other publication investigated type-II superconductors.
All but one of the high-Tc articles appeared in the period
1987–1989; evidently this was the golden age of high-
temperature superconductivity. Not surprisingly, this
subﬁeld represents the strongest coincidence of research
activity among these discovery/trend-setting articles.

The citation histories of these discovery publications
are again diverse. For example, the average lifetime of
citations to the 1974 publications that announced the
discovery of the J/ψ particle (#22 & 23 on the above
list) is less than 3 years (Fig. 5)! Once the discovery
was made and the ﬁeld progressed, there was evidently
little motivation for citing the original papers. The ﬁeld
of high-temperature superconductivity also has given rise
to rapid obsolescence, with two publications (#30 & 33
on the above list) having an average citation lifetime of
less than 2.7 years and no more than 4 citations annually
to these papers after 1996. On the other hand, the oldest

publications in this compilation are “Correlation Energy
of an Electron Gas at High Density” Phys. Rev. 106,
364 (1957) by M. Gell-Mann and K. A. Brueckner (305
citations, average citation age 18.77), and “Theory of
the Fermi Interaction” Phys. Rev. 109, 193 (1958) by R.
P. Feynman and M. Gell-Mann (462 citations, average
citation age 10.15). The disappearance of these papers
from current PR citations possibly stems from the fact
that the results of these publications are now included in
many textbooks.

VIII. DISCUSSION

The availability of a large continuous body of cita-
tion data from a major physics journal, Physical Review
(PR), provides a unique window with which to observe
how subﬁelds evolve and how individual publications can
inﬂuence subsequent research. It is important, however,
to be aware of the limitations of the citation data from
PR journals only. For a variety of reasons, many im-
portant physics articles have not been published in PR
journals; thus much important citation data is simply
missing from our study.

In addition, our data does not include citations to PR
articles from articles that were not published in PR jour-
nals. Their omission is a signiﬁcant eﬀect. To get a
feeling for its magnitude, we provide below the list of
23 elementary-particle physics PR articles that had been
cited more than 1500 times at the end of 2003 from all
sources, as tabulated by the SPIRES database [25]. This
compilation extends to 52nd place among papers in the
all-time citation rank. Also included is the number of

internal citations (citations from other PR publications),
also by the end of 2003. The ratio of internal to total

citations falls in range of 0.19 – 0.36 for all the listed
articles.

The signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the number of PR
citations and all citations provides a sense of the incom-
pleteness of the PR data. It would therefore be worth-
while to extend this citation study to include a broader
range of physics journals to see if such an extension would
lead to qualitatively diﬀerent citation patterns.

Turning to results, one of our basic observations is the
striking conﬂuences of citation activity during the history
of Physical Review. Several of the most prominent of
these conﬂuences are quite recent but are based on work
of more than a half century ago. Another noteworthy
feature is the large role that a relatively small number of
individual physicists have played in the top-100 citation
impact publications in PR journals, with two individuals
each co-authoring ﬁve of these articles.

There is also a small number (15) of “hot” PR publica-
tions that have been cited at a remarkable rate in the past
few years. Much of this activity – 5 articles – revolves
around density functional theory, pseudopotential meth-
ods, and the development of accurate techniques for band
structure calculations. The origin of a signiﬁcant fraction
of this work is, in turn, the pioneering Kohn-Sham pa-

per of 1965. The only other topical coincidence in this
subset of publication is of quantum information theory;
this is the subject of 4 publications. Part of the reason
for the large citation rate to these hot papers could well
be the larger number of researchers compared to several
decades ago, as well as the rapid availability of preprints
through electronic archives. Nevertheless, the very rapid
and recent growth in citations of these publications seem
to portend scientiﬁc advances.

Once again, however, being limited to citations within
PR publications gives an incomplete picture. While hot
PR publications in condensed-matter physics are cited
internally approximately 200 times per year, the cita-
tion rate from all sources is likely much larger. In fact,
there are 3 recent and hot articles in elementary-particle
physics with a citation rate of at least 400 per year ac-
cording to the SPIRES database. The are: “The Large-N
Limit of Superconformal Field Theories and Supergrav-
ity”, J. M. Maldacena, Adv. Theor. Math. Phys. 2, 231
(1998), with 2898 citations at the end of 2003, “Anti-De
Sitter Space and Holography”, E. Witten, Adv. Theor.
Math. Phys. 2, 253 (1998), with 2062 citations, and “The

Hierarchy Problem and New Dimensions at a Millime-
ter”, N. Arkani-Hamed, S. Dimopoulos & G. R. Dvali,
Phys. Lett. B429, 263 (1998), with 2009 citations. Given
the larger size of condensed-matter physics, we anticipate
that the total citation rates to the hot publications in this
ﬁeld are much larger than 400 annually.

As a ﬁnal note, it is important to emphasize that cita-
tions are an imperfect measure of the quality of scientiﬁc
publications and the use of citation activity in guiding
policy decisions has to be made with great caution.

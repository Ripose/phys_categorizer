Abstract

In this paper, we investigate the economic mobility in some money transfer models
which have been applied into the research on monetary distribution. We demon-
strate the mobility by recording the agents’ ranks time series and observing the
volatility. We also compare the mobility quantitatively by employing an index, “the
per capita aggregate change in log-income”, raised by economists. Like the shape
of distribution, the character of mobility is also decided by the trading rule in these
transfer models. It is worth noting that even though diﬀerent models have the same
type of distribution, their mobility characters may be quite diﬀerent.

1 Introduction

The issue of income or wealth has been one of most popular topics of economists
all along. With the study on this issue, the performance and wellbeing of an
economy can be shown. So far, an enormous body of work has been devoted
to the two aspects of this issue: distribution[1,2,3,4,5] and mobility[6,7,8]. The
former is the information that one could use to determine how many economic
agents have each level of income or wealth. The latter is the phenomenon how
the agents’ income or wealth varies in economy over the time. It is obvious
that the distribution is static by nature, while the mobility is dynamic.

The study on the distribution can be traced back about 100 years ago. An Ital-
ian economist named Vilfredo Pareto declared that the income distributions in
several European countries uniformly follow Power laws[1]. He believed that
the income distribution is considerable stability both over time and across
countries and there must be an uniform mechanism which governs the shape
and formation of distribution. Benoit Mandelbrot observed that the distribu-
tion of income converges to Pareto distribution for many diﬀerent deﬁnitions of
income, for example income could be written as the sum of agricultural, com-
mercial or industrial incomes; in cash or in kind and so on[2]. Some economists
constructed a series of models to explain the shape of the distribution by in-
troducing the relationship between the wages and the abilities[3,4,5]. Based
on the description and shape of income distribution, the measurement meth-
ods of the inequality or well-being were discussed[9,10]. When the study went
further, economists began to realize that only analysis on the distribution is
not suﬃcient especially when exploring the generating mechanism of income
and measuring the degree of inequality[11,12]. When we compare the degree
of inequality in two economies with the same distribution but diﬀerent dy-
namics, it is obvious that the static analysis based on the data of a given
moment cannot provide a complete picture, and the dynamic analysis on in-
come distribution is needed. Consequently, the study on the income mobility,
which is one important aspect of the dynamics, got started. Most eﬀort was
put into the concept, measurement and empirical research of mobility based
on the longitudinal data[6,7,8].

As well known, the statistical issues like the distribution and its formation
mechanism are always concerned by physicists. When physicists forayed into
the economic domain with their advanced tools, they chose statistical char-
acteristics of some economic variables, such as return in ﬁnancial markets,
volatility of GDP, as landing zone. The income or wealth distribution and
its growth or variation attract some econophysicists’ attention[13,14,15,16].
Following the line of Pareto, researchers have recently carried out some new
empirical work and the results show the income distributions in modern econ-
omy still have power-law tails[17,18,19,20]. In order to explore the formation
mechanism of distribution, a series of multi-agent models had been constructed
in which the interaction between agents is simpliﬁed as random transfer of
money in a closed system [21,22,23,24,25]. Some of these works are reviewed
in a popular journal[26], and the related models are called as money transfer
models[27]. A. Dr˘agulescu and V.M. Yakovenko built a simple model bas-
ing on the analogies between money transfer in trading and energy transfer
in molecule collision[22]. The simulation results show that the distribution
of money obeys a Boltzmann-Gibbs law. A group led by B.K. Chakrabarti
introduced the saving behavior into the model[23,24], and found the money
distribution follows a Gamma law when all the agents are set with the same
saving factor, but changes to a power law as the saving factor is set randomly.
N. Ding et al introduced the preferential behavior into the trading process and

2

obtained a stationary power-law distribution[25].

So far, econophysicists paid much of their attention to the distribution and how
it relates to the trading rule. In fact, distribution is just one of the windows
through which how the economy works can be observed. In money transfer
models, where the economy is assumed to be conserved, continuous transfer
of money among agents leads to stationary distribution of money. However,
agents still switch their positions or ranks even after the distribution gets
steady. Thus, in order to explore the mechanism behind the distribution, static
analysis on distribution is not suﬃcient. Suppose two cases where the steady
distributions are observed to be the same, but their ﬂuctuation modes of
agents’ ranks are diﬀerent. To distinguish which case is closer to the reality,
the analysis on mobility is in need, for it can provide more information as
to the mechanism behind the distribution due to its dynamic and onymous
nature.

Like what the researchers have done on the mechanism of distribution, to
ﬁnd what is behind the mobility is meaningful. However, the economists de-
voted their eﬀorts much more to the concept and measurement of mobility
as mentioned above, but a little to the mechanism behind it 1 . Fortunately,
the transfer models proposed by econophysicists to discuss the relationship
between the trading rule and distribution are also available for understand-
ing the formation of mobility. Especially, these models embody the essential
character of mobility, for agents in the assumed economy always change their
position by exchanging the money. This phenomenon has been referred to in
Hayes’s review article[26].

In addition, the study on mobility in the proposed models makes the evaluation
criteria more complete. The aim of econophysicists to develop these models is
to mimic the real economy by abstracting its essence. We cannot judge whether
such abstraction is reasonable or not depending on the shape of distribution
only. In other words, even though the distribution resulted from the proposed
model is consistent with the reality, we are not convinced that it is reasonable.
The mechanism might yield a diﬀerent mobility character from the reality.
Thus, we must take mobility into account when constructing a “right” multi-
agent model. For instance, to develop a model to simulate the Japanese income
distribution, the theoretical prediction on mobility must be tested against the
empirical results in Ref.[16].

In this paper, the mobility in four typical transfer models is observed and
analyzed. In the next section, we make a brief review of the researches of
economists on the mobility by which our work can be erected and from which
the measurement index we employed comes. In Section 3, the four models and

1 G. C. Loury tried to employ the stochastic theory to research the mobility among
successive generations of workers[28].

3

simulations are introduced. The results are analyzed and compared in Section
4. The ﬁnal section summarizes.

2 Income Mobility

Since the 1960s, economists gradually realized static snapshots of income dis-
tribution alone is not suﬃcient for meaningful evaluation of wellbeing and the
income mobility must also be weighted. Kuznets[11] once declared that two
societies “... may diﬀer greatly in meaning because of diﬀerent degrees of in-
ternal mobility ...”, even if they have identical size distributions of income.
And, Jarvis and Jenkins[12] argued:“ To some people, greater inequality at a
point in time is more tolerable if accompanied by signiﬁcant mobility...”.

That can be understood easily from a simple example. Suppose in an econ-
omy there are two individuals with income $1 and $2 initially. At the next
moment, the incomes of them change to $2 and $1. The distribution in this
case is unchanged, but the rank of either individual varies over time. Although
the system seems unequal at either of the two moments in terms of the distri-
bution, the fact is that the two individuals are quite equal combining these two
moments. Besides, from the simple example, it can also been found out that
the structure of economy may varies heavily with an unchanged distribution.
So, the investigation on mobility is helpful to the measurement on equality. It
should be noted that mobility is not income’s particular character. There are
mobilities in the other economic concepts, such as wealth, consumption, labor
and etc. Thus, the research on income mobility is also helpful to the studies
on those aspects.

In contrast to the meaning of mobility research, there is less consensus on
the concept and measurement. Some researchers view mobility as a rerank-
ing phenomenon: people just switch their position. To measure this purely
relative mobility, some indexes are used, such as the coeﬃcient of rank cor-
relation, the average jump in rank and the mean number of absolute ranks
changed. In the view of other researchers, any change of individuals’ income
leads to mobility. Here, it is an absolute concept. Naturally, the income mo-
bility can be decomposed into two parts: mobility induced by reranking phe-
nomenon and mobility induced by distributional change. To measure this ab-
solute mobility, G. S. Fields and E. A. Ok started from a series of axioms and
chose “the per capita aggregate change in log-income” whose expression is
N
M = 1
k=1 | log xk0 − log xk1|, where xk0 and xk1 are the initial income and
ﬁnal income of agent k respectively[29]. In a sense, this index is actually one
kind of distance between two states of an economy. The “distant” index not
only can reﬂect the change of income in aggregate level, but also is sensitive
to the individuals’ switch in rank.

P. V. Kerm went further and divided the mobility induced by distributional
change into two parts: dispersion and growth[30]. Moreover, the empirical anal-
ysis in the work shows that income mobility are essentially due to ‘reranking’
mobility. In fact, the ‘reranking’ mobility can be deemed as the transfer of
income among people with given aggregate income. By identifying the income
with money, this kind of the ‘reranking’ phenomenon can be demonstrated
in the money transfer models where the total amount of money is conserved.
Thus the mechanism of mobility can be analyzed based on these models that
will be introduced in the next section.

3 Transfer Models and Simulations

The construction of transfer models provides a powerful tool for the study on
the income or wealth distribution and mobility. The economies assumed in
these models are pure monetary systems which are only composed of agents
and money. The money is held by agents individually. And the agents exchange
money to each other according to the trading rule which ensures the non-
negativity of any agent’s money and the conservation of the total money.
The simulation results show that no matter how uniformly and forcefully one
distributes money among agents initially, the successive trading eventually
leads to a steady distribution of money. And the shape of money distribution is
only determined by the trading rule. There exist considerable transfer models
which are used in the study on distribution. From these models, here we just
choose the following four typical ones to show the mobility phenomena. Since
the scale and the initial distribution have no eﬀect on the ﬁnal result, all of
the simulations of these four models were carried out with N = 1, 000 agents
and M = 100, 000 units of money. The amount of money held by each agent
is set to be M/N = 100 at the beginning.

3.1 Model I: Ideal Gas-like Model

By identifying money in a closed economy with energy and the trade between
agents with two-body elastic collision in an ideal gas, A. Dr˘agulescu and V.M.
Yakovenko proposed the ideal gas-like model. In each round of this model, two
agent i, j are chosen to take part in the trade randomly. As to which one is
the payer or receiver, it is also decided randomly. Supposing the amounts of
money held by agent i and j are mi and mj respectively, the amount of money
to be exchanged ∆m is then expressed as follows:

∆m =

ε(mi + mj)

1
2

(1)

5

where, ε is a random number from zero to unit. If the payer cannot aﬀord the
payment, the trade is cancelled.

3.2 Model II & III: Uniform Saving Rate Model and Diverse Saving Rate

Model

B.K. Chakrabarti etc. thought the gap between reality and the ideal gas-
like model is too huge. Some features, such as saving behavior, should be
considered. They argued that the people always keep some of money in hand
as saving when trading. So, B.K. Chakrabarti etc. developed the ideal gas-like
model by introducing the saving behavior.

They employed the trading pattern of ideal gas-like model that two agents
are chosen out to participate the trading in each round. The diﬀerence is that
agents keep a part of money as saving as they participate the trade. And the
ratio of saving to all of the money held by one agent is denoted s and called
saving rate in this paper. The saving rates of all the agents are set before the
simulations. Suppose that at t-th round, agent i and j take part in trading,
so at t + 1-th round their money mi(t) and mj(t) change to

mi(t + 1) = mi(t) + ∆m; mj(t + 1) = mj(t) − ∆m;

(2)

where

∆m = (1 − s)[(ε − 1)mi(t) + εmj(t)];

and ε is a random fraction. It can be seen that if ∆m is positive, agent i is
the receiver of the trade, otherwise the payer. This model degenerates into
the ideal gas-like model if s is set to be zero. In this model, all of agents
are homogenous with the same saving rate. So we call it uniform saving rate
model.

B.K. Chakrabarti etc. developed the model further by introducing diverse
saving rate. They set agents’ saving rates randomly before the simulations
and keep them unchanged all through the simulations. Likewise, this model is
called diverse saving rate model. Correspondingly, the trading rule Equation
(2) is transformed into

mi(t + 1) = mi(t) + ∆m; mj(t + 1) = mj(t) − ∆m;

(3)

where

∆m = (1 − si)(ε − 1)mi(t) + (1 − sj)εmj(t);

6

and si, sj are the saving rates of agent i and j respectively.

3.3 Model IV: Preferential Dispensing Model

We attribute two forces to the formation of power-law distribution: one is
preference in dispensing, which lets the rich have higher probability to get
the money; the other one is stochastic disbursement, which ensures that the
richest would be deprived of wealth and become the poor in some day. In
order to verify this idea, we proposed a new money transfer model named as
preferential dispensing model in this paper and obtained a steady power-law
distribution of money.

In each round of this model, every agent pays money out, and the ratio of
payment to the amount of money he held is determined randomly. To any
unit of these money, a receiver is chosen randomly from the agents except the
payer. The probability pi,j at which agent i (potential receiver) gets the money
from agent j (payer) is given by

pi,j =

mi
N
n=1(n6=j) mn

,

P

(4)

where mi is the amount of money held by agent i before the trade. The con-
straint n 6= j in this rule eliminates the possibility for the payer to get back
the money he has paid out.

4 Results and Discussion

To show the ‘reranking’ mobility, at the end of each round, we sort all of
agents according to their money and record their ranks. Here, we choose the
rank rather than the amount of money to show the mobility because the
ﬂuctuation of rank can reﬂect the mobility especially the ‘reranking’ mobility
with an unchanged distribution. Another reason is that the former is too
sensitive to the perturbation. In these transfer models, agents keep to switch
their rank over the time whether the distribution is stationary or not. To avoid
the eﬀect of transients, all of data are recorded after the money distributions
get stationary. It should be noted that the time intervals of sampling are
diﬀerent for these models as collecting the data. The data are sampled every
1000 rounds 2 in the ﬁrst three models and every round in model IV. We
know that only a pair of agents take part in trade in each round of the ﬁrst

2 Which is identical to the number of agents N .

7

three models, while all of agents do so in the Model IV. It is obvious that the
mobilities are not in the same level if the sampling intervals are the same in
these models. In order to make the mobilities comparable, we proceed sampling
in the way mentioned above for the times per agent taking part in trading in
one round in model IV is equal to that in 1000 rounds in the ﬁrst three models.
In this way, we get the time series of rank for all agents. Some typical time
series of rank from the sampling data of these four models are shown in Figure
1 correspondingly. The rank is inversely related to the amount of money held,
so the more money an agent held, the lower his curve is in these ﬁgures.

From the rank time series plotted in Figure 1, we can compare the charac-
ter of rank ﬂuctuation of these four models with each other. It can be seen
that the ﬂuctuations in model I and model II are quite similar except the
frequency(Fig.1a and 1b). All of the agents can be the rich and be the poor.
The rich have the probability to be poor and the poor also may be luck to get
money to be the rich. In other words, the economies in these two models are
quite fair where every agent is equal in the opportunity. As mentioned in Sec-
tion 3, the model I is a special case of model II when the uniform saving rate
is zero. Thereby the Figure 1a and b can be taken as the results of the cases
where the uniform saving rate are 0 and 0.5 respectively. Comparing them, it
can be seen that the lower the saving rate, the higher ﬂuctuation frequency.
That means lower saving rate leads to greater mobility in model II. From
Fig.1c, we can see that the economy in model III is highly stratiﬁed where
the rich always keep their position, and the poor are doomed to being the
poor. Moreover, the agents in diﬀerent level diﬀer in the rank ﬂuctuation. The
higher the agents’ rank, the smaller the variance of their rank. From Fig.1d,
each of the agents has the same probability to be the rich in the model IV
just like model I. However, the time interval that agents keep in their current
position is quite longer that results in a lower degree of mobility.

Now we turn to quantitative measurement of mobility. Although there are
quite a few indexes for measuring the relative mobility, they fall into disuse
due to various deﬁciencies. In contrast, the measurement index raised by G.
S. Fields et al has the advantage over them. It can be applied for not only
the absolute mobility but also the relative one, as long as we take the rank of
agents as the sampling variable. So we deﬁne the ‘reranking’ mobility between
the two sample recorded in diﬀerent moments as follows:

l(t, t′) =

| log(xi(t)) − log(xi(t′))|,

(5)

1
N

N

X
i=1

where xi(t) and xi(t′) are the rank of agent i at t and t′ respectively. It is
obvious that the bigger the value of l, the greater the level of mobility. The
values of l of the four models are shown in Table 1. These results are gotten

8

in the following way. Firstly, more than 9000 samples are recorded continu-
ously after the distribution gets steady. Secondly, the ‘distance’ between any
two consecutive samples is accounted. Finally, the average of these ‘distances’
is calculated as l. Just as mentioned above, in the ﬁrst three models, the
diﬀerence between t and t′ is 1000, while that in model IV is 1.

The data given in Table 1 verify our primary conclusion about model I and
II derived from Fig.1a and 1b in some degree. As indicated, the mobility de-
creases when the saving rate increases. The intuition for this result is straight-
forward. The more money agents keep when trading, the less money they pick
out to participate in the trade. And so the less probability of change in rank.
Therefore, the higher saving factor, the lower mobility.

Comparing with model II, the value of mobility is quite small in model III.
This is obviously due to the stratiﬁcation. However, what surprised us is that
the value is much smaller than that in model II when the uniform saving rate
is 0.5, even than that when the uniform saving rate is set to be 0.9. As we
know, the agents in the economy assumed interact with each other and the
index cannot be obtained by simple mathematical averaging. As the agents
with high rank almost do not change their positions, their contribution to
the mobility is nearly none. Although the rest of agents move drastically, the
range of their rank ﬂuctuation is limited. As a result, the mobility in model III
is very small. With regard to stratiﬁcation, the diverse saving rates must be
culprit because they are the only denotation of the agents’ heterogeneity. To
demonstrate this point, we show the relation between the agents’ ranks and
their saving rates in Fig.2. It can be seen clearly that there exists the negative
relation between the rank and the saving rate. And the rank ﬂuctuation of
agents with low saving rate is more drastic than that of agents with high
saving rate.

Now, we turn to the mobility in Model IV. From Table 1, we can see that no
stratiﬁcation appears in this case and the degree of mobility is the smallest.
The homogeneity of agents’ behavior pattern in this model gives every agent
an equal chance to get rich. However, the preferential behavior ensures the
agents keeping their position for a relatively long period. As a result, the
assumed economy evolves with very low mobility and without stratiﬁcation.
Comparing model III and model IV, we can conclude that although both of
the monetary distributions follow Power laws, their mobility characters are
totally diﬀerent.

From the above discussion, it can be seen that the index can help us to compare
the mobility quantitatively. However, the index itself can not give the whole
picture of mobility. The “distant” index we used in this paper can be rewritten

9

as

l(t, t′) =

| log(voli(t, t′) + 1)|,

1
N

N
X
i=1

(6)

(7)

where voli(t, t′) actually denotes the volatility of agent i’s rank. It takes the
following form

voli(t, t′) =

xi(t′) − xi(t)
xi(t)

.

The new expression indicates that the index is a presentation of volatility of
rank at aggregate level. To examine the distribution of volatility can provide
us the information of mobility in more detail.

The distributions of the rank volatility for the four models are illustrated in
Figure 3 respectively. It is noted that the distributions of the rank variety ra-
tio in model I and II are quite similar and their right tails follow power laws.
In model II, we further calculated the exponent of the power-law distribution
p(x) ∝ x−α for diﬀerent uniform saving rates. As shown in Fig.4, the exponent
α varies with the saving rate in an exponential way. This result is consistent
with the dependence of the mobility index on the saving rate. When the sav-
ing rate gets higher, the money exchanged will be less and the volatility of
rank will decrease. Consequently, when the saving rate increases, the right
side of volatility distribution will shift to the vertical axis, leading to a more
steeper tail. From Figure 3c and 3d, it is clear that the distributions of the
rank volatility for models III and IV are quite diﬀerent. The tail of volatility
distribution of model III converges to an exponential line as the times of sim-
ulations increase. In model IV, the part of the volatility distribution within
the range from 0 to about 1.5 has a good ﬁtting to an exponential line, but
the tail scatters no matter how many times of the simulations are performed.

5 Summary

To economists, mobility is a supplement to distribution when the equalities
are compared. To physicists, it is an approach to the mechanism behind the
distribution in microscope. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the
mobility phenomena in four typical money transfer models. Some characters
of mobility are also presented by recording the time series of agents’ ranks
and observing the distribution of rank volatility. We ﬁnd that the mobility is
also decided by the trading rule in these transfer models. Our ﬁnding implies
that the economies with the same distribution may be diﬀerent in mobility.

10

It would be more helpful to take the character of mobility into account when
constructing a multi-agent model on the issue of distribution.

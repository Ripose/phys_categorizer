Abstract

Employing proﬁts data of Japanese companies in 2002 and 2003, we conﬁrm that Pareto’s
law and the Pareto index are derived from the law of detailed balance and Gibrat’s law.
The last two laws are observed beyond the region where Pareto’s law holds. By classifying
companies into job categories, we ﬁnd that companies in a small scale job category have
more possibilities of growing than those in a large scale job category. This kinematically
explains that the Pareto index for the companies in the small scale job class is larger than
that for the companies in the large scale job class.

Introduction

The pioneering discovery by Pareto [1] is not only an important cue for research in fractal
but also a signiﬁcant issue in economics. The Pareto law states that a cumulative number
distribution NP (> x) obeys power-law for income x which is larger than a certain observational
threshold x0:

NP (> x) ∝ x

for

x > x0,

−µ

(1)

where the exponent µ is called Pareto index. Recently Pareto’s law is checked with high accuracy
by using digitalized data [2]. Although the number of persons or companies in the range where
Pareto’s law (1) holds is a few percent, the amount of the income occupies a large part of the total
income. High income persons or high income companies can, therefore, inﬂuence economics. It
is quite important to investigate the mechanism which governs them.

The research on the income distribution is well investigated in econophysics [3]. Many mod-
els to explain the distribution are proposed (for instance recently Refs. [4, 5, 6, 7]). Furthermore,
Fujiwara et al. [8] ﬁnd that, without assuming any model, Pareto’s law can be derived kinemat-
ically from the law of detailed balance and Gibrat’s law [9] which are observed in high quality

digitalized data. They derive not only Pareto’s law but also the reﬂection law which correlates
a positive growth rate distribution to negative one by the Pareto index µ. This means that
Pareto’s law and index are explained by the law of detailed balance and Gibrat’s law. We
should note that these arguments are limited in the high income region (x > x0).

The ﬁndings in Ref. [8] are quite fascinating especially in the idea that the Pareto index can
be understood by the growth rate distribution. In this paper, we ﬁrst investigate the application
as follows. The distribution of high income companies follows Pareto’s law and the Pareto index
is about 1. This is called Zipf’s law [10]. It is also known that the distributions in most job
categories follow Pareto’s law. Those Pareto indices, however, scatter around 1 [5, 11, 12]. We
examine the reﬂection law that relates the change of the Pareto index to the change of the
growth rate distribution in job categories.

There is, however, a problem in estimating the Pareto index by the growth rate distribution
in each job category. The number of companies in several job classes is not enough to observe
the reﬂection law. We clear this diﬃculty by employing proﬁts data which have no threshold in
contrast to high income data announced publicly.

By observing all positive proﬁts data, we conﬁrm the law of detailed balance. We also ﬁnd
that Gibrat’s law holds in the region where the only initial proﬁts are conditioned to be larger
than the threshold. In this case, Pareto’s law is also obtained and the reﬂection law can be
observed in companies data classiﬁed into job categories. Using these arguments, we conﬁrm
the correlation between the Pareto index and the growth rate distribution.

In addition, we ﬁnd that companies in a small scale job category have more possibilities of
growing proﬁts than those in a large scale job category. This kinematically explains that the
Pareto index for the companies in the small job class is larger than that for the companies in
the large scale job class, which is reported in Ref. [12].

2 Pareto’s law derived from the detailed balance and Gibrat’s

law

In this section, we brieﬂy review the proof that the detailed balance and Gibrat’s law lead to

Pareto’s law and the reﬂection law [8].

Let the income at two successive points in time be denoted by x1 and x2. Growth rate R is
deﬁned as the ratio R = x2/x1. The detailed balance and Gibrat’s law can be summarized as
follows.

• Detailed balance (Time-reversal symmetry)

The joint probability distribution function (pdf) P12(x1, x2) is symmetric:

P12(x1, x2) = P12(x2, x1).

(2)

• Gibrat’s law

The conditional probability distribution of growth rate Q(R|x1) is independent of the

2

initial value x1:

where Q(R|x1) is deﬁned by using the pdf P1(x1) and the joint pdf P1R(x1, R) as

Q(R|x1) = Q(R),

Q(R|x1) =

P1R(x1, R)
P1(x1)

.

These phenomenological properties, for example, are observed in the data of high income
Japanese companies in 2002 and 2003. In Japan, companies having annual income more than
40 million yen are announced publicly as “high income companies” every year. The database
is published by Diamond Inc. In Fig. 1, all the companies are plotted, the income of which in
2002 (x1) and 2003 (x2) exceeded 40 million yen (x0):

x1 > x0

and

x2 > x0.

The number of companies which satisfy this condition is 50, 632. In Fig. 1, the time-reversal
symmetry (2) is apparent. In Fig. 2, we conﬁrm Pareto’s law (1) for the companies, the income
of which satisﬁes the condition (5). The Pareto indices µ are very close to 1, and the case is
often referred to as Zipf’s law [10].

We also examine Gibrat’s law in the regime (5). Here we divide the range of x1 into logarith-
mically equal bins as x1 ∈ 4 × [104+0.2(n−1), 104+0.2n] with n = 1, · · · , 5. In Fig. 3, the probability
density for r is expressed for each bin. In all the cases, all the probability density distributions
for diﬀerent n collapse on a single curve approximately. This means that the distribution for the
growth rate r is approximately independent of the initial value x1. Here the probability density
for r deﬁned by q(r) is related to that for R by

log10 Q(R = 10r) + r + log10(ln 10) = log10 q(r).

Pareto’s law (1) can be derived from the detailed balance (2) and Gibrat’s law (3) without
assuming any model [8]. Due to the relation of P12(x1, x2)dx1dx2 = P1R(x1, R)dx1dR under the
change of variables from (x1, x2) to (x1, R), these two joint pdf’s are related to each other,

By the use of this relation, the detailed balance (2) is rewritten in terms of P1R(x1, R) as follows:

Substituting the joint pdf P1R(x1, R) for the conditional probability Q(R|x1) deﬁned in Eq. (4),
the detailed balance is expressed as

P1R(x1, R) = x1P12(x1, x2).

P1R(x1, R) = R

From the detailed balance and Gibrat’s law (3), one ﬁnds the following:

By expanding this equation around R = 1, the following diﬀerential equation is obtained

where x denotes x1 and G(R) is deﬁned as Q(R−1)/(R Q(R)). The solution is given by

1(x) = 0,

with G′(1) = µ + 1. This is Pareto’s law, which leads to the cumulative representation in Eq. (1)
as follows: NP (> x) = NP (> x0)P1(> x) = NP (> x0) R

x dyP1(y) ∝ x−µ.

∞

From Eqs. (12) and (10), one ﬁnds the relation between positive growth rate (R > 1) and

negative one (R < 1),

In terms of q(r) in Eq. (6), this is written as

Q(R) = R

−µ−2Q(R

−1).

log10 q(r) = −µr + log10 q(−r).

In Fig. 3, we examine this relation, which is called the ’Reﬂection law’ in Ref. [8]. By the use of
the reﬂection law to the best-ﬁt line [5]

we obtain the line

with

log10 q(r) = c − t+ r

for r > 0,

log10 q(r) = c + t− r

for r < 0

µ = t+ − t−,

where µ ∼ 1. The reﬂected line (16) seems to match the data in Fig. 3 [8].

3 Pareto index induced from the growth rate distribution

From the argument in the preceding section, we expect the estimation of the Pareto index
by using Eq. (17) under the detailed balance and Gibrat’s law. There is, however, a diﬃculty in
measuring the slope t− of the reﬂected line (16). The reason is that the data for large negative
growth, r ≤ 4 + log10 4 − log10 x1, are not available due to the limit (5) (Fig. 3). The reﬂected
line (16) does not match the total data which are not classiﬁed into bins for instance (Fig. 4).
Indeed, the Pareto index is estimated to be about 0 from the best ﬁt lines (15) for r > 0 and
(16) for r < 0.

In order to avoid this problem, we must remove the threshold x0 in the region (5). This
is, however, impossible as long as we deal with the income data announced publicly in Japan.
We employ proﬁts as another economic quantity similar to the income. Although proﬁts of
companies are not announced publicly, the data are available on “CD Eyes” published by Tokyo

4

Shoko Research, Ltd. [13] for instance. This database contains ﬁnancial information of over 250
thousand companies in Japan. We deal with the companies, the proﬁts of which in 2002 (x1)
and 2003 (x2) exceeded 0 yen:

x1 > 0

and

x2 > 0.

(18)

(19)

In Fig. 5, all the companies which satisfy this condition are plotted, the number of which is
132, 499. The time-reversal symmetry (2) is apparent even in Fig. 5.

We desire to examine Gibrat’s law without the threshold. The condition is, therefore, em-

ployed:

x1 > x0

and

x2 > 0,

where x0 is 40 million yen. The number of the companies which satisfy this limit is 28, 644.
In Fig. 6, Pareto’s law (1) for the companies is observed in the region (5), not in (19). Let us
examine Gibrat’s law in the regime (19). We classify the data for the high proﬁts companies,
x1 > x0, into ﬁve bins in the same manner in the preceding section. The result is shown in
Fig. 7. We conﬁrm Gibrat’s law without the forbid region caused by the threshold.

Under the extended limit (19), we can derive Pareto’s law. In the derivation, we should pay

attention to the region where Gibrat’s law holds as follows:

Q(R|x1) = Q(R)
−1|x2) = Q(R

−1)

Q(R

for

for

x1 > x0 and x2 > 0,

x1 > 0 and x2 > x0.

(20)

(21)

In the region (5) where these two conditions are satisfying, Eq. (10) is relevant and Pareto’s law
(12) holds as a result. This is observed in Fig. 6.

The reﬂection law (13) is relevant in the region (5) strictly. Here we assume that Eqs. (13)
and (14) hold approximately near R = 1 (r = 0) even in the region (19), the validity of which
should be checked against the results. Under this assumption, we evaluate the Pareto index by
using Eq. (17). In Fig. 8, the Pareto index is estimated to be 1.02 ± 0.02 from the best ﬁt lines
(15) for r > 0 and (16) for r < 0 for the total data which are not classiﬁed into bins. This is
consistent with the assumption. We should comment that the Pareto index is estimated to be
about 0 for the companies, the proﬁts of which in 2002 (x1) and 2003 (x2) exceeded x0.

4 High proﬁts companies in job categories

It is reported that income distributions in most job categories follow Pareto’s law, but those
Pareto indices scatter around 1 [5, 11, 12]. The same phenomenon is observed in proﬁts dis-
tributions. In this section, we classify the companies into job categories in order to verify the
results in the preceding section.

In Japan, companies are categorized by Japan Standard Industrial Classiﬁcation (JSIC).
This industrial classiﬁcation is composed of four stages, namely divisions, major groups, groups
and details (industries). The composition includes 14 divisions, 99 major groups, 463 groups
and 1,322 industries. The classiﬁcation in the database “CD Eyes” follows JSIC.

5

We classify the 28, 644 companies into the 14 divisions, the proﬁts of which satisfy the
condition (19). Because the number of companies classiﬁed into 99 major groups is not enough
to investigate the growth rate distribution. The name of each division and the number of
companies are follows, A: Agriculture (84), B: Forestry (1), C: Fisheries (14), D: Mining (3,512),
E: Construction (1,182), F: Manufacturing (6,428), G: Electricity, Gas, Heat Supply and Water
(218), H: Transport and Communications (2,300), I: Wholesale, Retail Trade and Eating &
Drinking Places (8,699), J: Finance and Insurance (1,994), K: Real Estate (293), L: Services
(3,919), M: Government, N.E.C. (0) and N: Industries Unable to Classify (0).

In each job division, we measure t+ and t− of the best ﬁt lines (15) and (16) of all the
companies in the class. The Pareto index can be estimated from the relation (17) by assuming
the detailed balance and Gibrat’s law. Here we have excluded A, B, C, M and N divisions,
because the number of companies in each division is not enough to observe the growth rate
distribution. By comparing the Pareto indices estimated by the growth rate with those directly
measured in the power-law, we reconﬁrm the relation (17) in Fig. 9.

After identifying the Pareto index change as the change of the growth rate distribution in job
categories, we consider an economic quantity which inﬂuences the growth rate. In balance-sheet,
the sum of capital stock and retained earnings is equity capital, and the sum of equity capital
and debt is assets. It is natural to consider that a company works based on the assets and gets
proﬁts (∼ income). The positive correlation between assets and income is reported in Ref. [11].
It is also pointed out that assets and sales correlate positively in the same reference. On the
other hand, the positive correlation between sales and capital stock is observed in the database
“CD Eyes”. Consequently there is a positive correlation between assets and capital stock1. We
employ, therefore, average “capital stock” as a quantity which statistically characterizes the
scale of companies in each job category2.

In Ref. [12], it is reported that there is a relation between the average capital stock of high
income companies and the Pareto index in 99 major groups. The larger the average capital
becomes, the smaller the Pareto index becomes. The same phenomenon is observed in proﬁts
distributions (Fig. 10). This means that the Pareto index is related to the scale of companies in
job categories.

We can understand the kinematics by the relation between the average capital and the slope
of growth rate distribution (t+, t−). In Fig. 11, t+ decreases with the average capital and t−
hardly responds to that. The companies in the small scale job category (Mining for instance)
have more possibilities of growing proﬁts than the companies in the large scale job category
(Finance and Insurance for instance). On the other hand, the possibility of growing down is
independent of the scale of the job category for high proﬁts companies, x1 ≥ x0. As a result, the
relation (17) explains that the Pareto index for the companies in the small scale job category is
larger than that for the companies in the large scale job category.

1This correlation is probably caused by the Japanese commercial law. In Japan, capital stock is treated as an

important quantity to protect creditors.

2Indeed, the database “CD Eyes” includes no information about equity capital or assets.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we have ﬁrst shown that the Pareto index can be estimated by proﬁts growth
rate distribution of companies in Japan. The point is that the data have no threshold (x0) in
contrast to the high income data. We ﬁnd that the law of detailed balance and Gibrat’s law
hold in the extended region (x1 > 0, x2 > 0) and (x1 > x0, x2 > 0), respectively.

By classifying companies into 14 job divisions, we have secondly conﬁrmed the reﬂection law

that relates the change of the Pareto index to the change of the growth rate distribution.

We thirdly ﬁnd that the companies in the small scale job category have more possibilities
of growing proﬁts than the companies in the large scale job category by observing the relation
between the average capital and the slope of growth rate distribution. The relation between the
average capital and the Pareto index is also veriﬁed. Consequently it is kinematically explained
that the Pareto index for the companies in the small scale job category is larger than that for
the companies in the large scale job category.

We have concentrated our attention to the region (x1 > x0, x2 > 0) in order to examine
Gibrat’s law. Beyond this regime, the breakdown of Gibrat’s law is studied, the recent works
about that are done by Stanley’s group [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. In this paper, we ﬁnd the law of
detailed balance over the regime where Pareto’s law holds. We expect that the distribution in
the region (x1 ≤ x0, x2 > 0) can be derived kinematically from the law of detailed balance and
the results found by Stanley’s group. This argument will kinematically decide the distribution
for the middle region where Pareto’s law does not hold.

Models for control of epidemics on local, global and small-world net-
works are considered, with only partial information accessible about the
status of individuals and their connections. The main goal of an eﬀective
control measure is to stop the epidemic at a lowest possible cost, including
treatment and cost necessary to track the disease spread. We show that
delay in detection of infectious individuals and presence of long-range links
are the most important factors determining the cost. However, the details
of long-range links are usually the least-known element of the social inter-
actions due to their occasional character and potentially short life-span.
We show that under some conditions on the probability of disease spread,
it is advisable to attempt to track those links. Thus, collecting some addi-
tional knowledge about the network structure might be beneﬁcial to ensure
a successful and cost-eﬀective control.

1. Introduction

One of the main goals of epidemiological modeling is to provide guide-
lines for controlling disease outbreaks. Traditionally this has been under-
stood in terms of reducing the number of infected individuals. With a cheap
vaccination available, ‘blind’ vaccination of a large proportion of individuals
might be a simple and yet optimal solution [1]. However, in many cases the
epidemic must be stopped at a manageable cost and with potentially limited
resources, leading to a mixture of preventive and responsive measures. In

the simplest case the goal of a successful prevention and eradication pro-
gramme is to minimize a number of individuals who have either been treated
or have been through the infection.

In a series of previous papers [1, 2] we have studied the suitability of local
control strategies for stopping spread of diseases on networks with a mixture
of local and global links. These include ‘small-world’ networks [3], with a
majority of contacts between nearest neighbors and a small number of global
links. By a local strategy we understand control measures limited to some
neighborhood of an infected individual. We have proposed a strategy that is
a mixture of responsive and preventive actions. A control event is triggered
by an appearance of a symptomatic individual (responsive measure) and
spans not only this individual but also its immediate neighbors on a certain
control network (preventive measure).

The preventive control (analogous to a ring-vaccination strategy) is nec-
essary because of the delay between the onset of infectiousness of an in-
dividual and the onset of symptoms. Thus, there is a possibility of pre-
symptomatic yet infectious individuals to be located in the neighborhood of
the observed disease case. The preventive local control strategy attempts to
treat such potential cases. The crucial assumption in our paper is that the
network that deﬁnes the control neighborhood is only a subset of the net-
work on which the disease spreads and in particular contains only a number
of long-range links. This reﬂects the limited ability of medical authorities
to track and follow contacts between individuals leading to spread of the
disease. In particular, we ask the following question: how detailed should
our knowledge be of the network structure to be able to stop the disease
at the lowest possible cost? We compare diﬀerent strategies by looking at
the ﬁnal size of the epidemics including individuals who have been through
the disease as well as those treated [2]. We also include an additional cost
associated with tracking long-range links.

2. Model

The model of epidemic spread and the associated control must take into
account the topology of the network on which the epidemic spreads, the
topology of the sub-network which is used for control, the state of each
individual and transitions between diﬀerent states. We consider two basic
topological structures, a 1-dimensional small world topology (SW1D) [3]
and 2-dimensional small world topology (SW2D). The disease spreads on
the full network, including local and global links. The control measures
can only follow a subset of those links and in particular for the SW1D and
SW2D topologies we assume that the subset contains all local links and a
number of additional shortcuts. This approach is caused by the fact that

fens5

it is much easier to track local interactions, interactions with surrounding
individuals, ﬁelds and farms, than long-range interactions, which might be
caused by geographical, technical, cultural or economical factors.

The epidemiological part of the model is based on an SIR model [4]
modiﬁed so that it includes pre- and post-symptomatic individuals (who
can both contribute to the spread of the infection) and recovered as well as
treated individuals.

2.1. Topology

SW2D topology is constructed from a regular lattice, with periodic
boundary conditions, to which a given number of additional random short-
cuts is added. Thus, every individual placed on the SW2D topology inter-
acts with its four nearest neighbors and some other individuals via additional
shortcuts (Fig. 1). The SW1D topology is constructed in a similar way, by
adding long-range links to a one-dimensional ring. For compatibility be-
tween SW2D and SW1D topology every node of the initial ring has 4 ﬁrst
order neighbors, 2 of them located on the left hand side and 2 on the right
hand side of the given node.

In the ﬁrst instance, the control network contains the regular (local)
part of the infection network. In addition, we assume that a certain number
of long-range links is included in the control network. This reﬂects an addi-
tional eﬀort that a government or health quthority put into disease tracking.
A control neighborhood of given order, z, is constructed in an iterative way.
Starting from the infected node the ﬁrst order control neighbors are local-
ized. The second order neighbors are then found as ﬁrst order neighbors of
the previous group. The whole procedure is repeated iteratively z times. A
single control action involves all individuals in the control neighborhood of
order z.

2.2. Individuals and Transitions

Individuals are placed on a given topology and can be in one of the

following states:

1. S – susceptible (or healthy), which can be infected with probability p
by any infectious or detected individual in its epidemic neighborhood;
2. I – infectious (infected but pre-symptomatic); can infect other nodes
from its epidemic neighborhood but cannot trigger a control measure.
In addition, with probability q it can spontaneously move to the de-
tected class, i.e. symptoms become observable;

3. D – detected (infected and symptomatic), can infect other nodes from
its epidemic spread neighborhood. In addition, it can spontaneously

Shortcut

Fig. 1. SW2D topology: In this example, a detected individual (black circle) is
in contact with its four nearest-neighbors on the disease network and to one node
connected by a shortcut (gray circles to indicate non-symptomatic infected individ-
uals). The control might then be applied locally, limited to the eight second-order
neighbors and individual itself on a treatment network (marked by a square). In
general a given ratio of additional shortcuts can be incorporated in the disease
control neighborhood making control more eﬃcient.

move to the recovered class (with the probability r) or can trigger a
treatment measure with the probability v that includes all individuals
within its control neighborhood;

4. R – recovered. This class includes individuals that have been through

the disease, can be treated but cannot become re-infected;

5. V – vaccinated (treated).

Individuals in this class have been in a
control neighborhood of a detected individual when the treatment
event was triggered. They cannot become re-infected.

We assume that all nodes in the network are occupied. The initial state
is a mixture of a majority of susceptible individuals with an addition of
few (0.1%, 0.5% or 5%) infectious (symptomatic) individuals. We denote
the total number of nodes by N and the number of susceptible nodes by S,
infected by I, detected by D, recovered by R and treated (vaccinated) by
V .

2.3. Simulations

Details of the simulations are given in [2, 1]. The model was updated
synchronously and the simulation loop was performed until the number of
infected individuals was equal to zero, i.e. until Tmax such that I(Tmax) +

D → R and state-dependent transitions S → I, D → V were performed.

In every iteration, spontaneous transitions from I → D,

We consider three treatment strategies, random vaccination, local vac-
cination and a mixed strategy combining local vaccination with tracking
of long-range links. In the random ‘blind’ vaccination, the given ratio of
randomly chosen individuals is vaccinated shortly after the ﬁrst detection
of the disease. For local treatment all individuals up to a given order z
surrounding and including the detected infected individual, are vaccinated
regardless of their current disease status. For the mixed strategy, a certain
proportion of long-range links is also tracked and individuals to which the
detected individual is linked are treated as well.

For a given set of parameters the simulation was averaged over 50 real-
izations for the total number of nodes equal to 2500 (i.e. the SW2D topology
is created from the square 50×50 lattice), with or without addition of a ﬁxed
number of 1023 long-range links. Larger sizes of the networks and larger
number of realizations were explored as well, but they did not improve or
change the results.

3. Results

Simulation results were analyzed to extract information that is relevant
for the design of an optimal control strategy. In particular, we look at a
severity index, a combined number of treated and recovered individuals,
X ≡ R(∞) + V (∞) at the end of an epidemic. This quantity represents
the combined severity of an untreated epidemic, R(∞), and the costs of
treating it, V (∞). In this paper, we mainly focus on eﬀects of a network
structure (including shortcuts) and probability of spread, p, on the severity
index, X, of the epidemic and the optimal extent of a control neighborhood
zc. zc is deﬁned as such a diameter of control neighborhood for which
X(zc) is minimal. All other parameters, except r which was set to 0.01,
take all possible values from the allowed domains and z ∈ {1, 2, . . . , 15}.
In addition, we vary the structure of the control network by changing the
proportion (TL = {0%, 10%, 20%, . . . , 100%}) of long-range links (shortcuts)
that are tracked and included in the control neighborhood.

We ﬁrst consider a ‘blind’ vaccination strategy, Fig. 2 and the eﬀect of
diﬀerent proportions of vaccinated individuals is assessed on the impact of
disease. This strategy is eﬀective when applied early and the number of
non-local links is small, see Fig. 2. Addition of long-range links or delaying
the application of the ‘blind’ treatment renders it ineﬀective, cf. Fig. 2.
In addition, from the social point of view, such a strategy is diﬃcult to
accept, because it is purely preventive and control measures are focused only
on initial vaccination of randomly chosen individuals without any further

actions during the outbreak.

The next group of possible control strategies is characterized by a mix-
ture of responsive and preventive actions. As new foci of the disease are
formed and spread, they trigger control measures that are applied in a
broader neighborhood of detected symptomatic individuals. The extended
control neighborhood compensates for the lack of our knowledge about the
exact state of individuals and the exact structure of interactions. The sever-
ity index X ≡ V (∞) + R(∞) is plotted in Fig. 3 as a function of infection
probability p and the control neighborhood size, z. For each value of p, there
exist an optimal value zc for which the control measures are most eﬃcient.
If z < zc the disease escapes the control, while for z > zc too many indi-
viduals are vaccinated. The exact shape of the surface depends on network
properties and epidemic parameters. Nonlocal interactions make minima
less pronounced; nevertheless, purely local strategies are capable of stoping

epidemics even in the presence of long-range links [2].

Epidemics can spread not only to the nearest neighbors but also, via
random non-local shortcuts, to distant part of the network. On the one
hand, long-range links are crucial for the spread of the outbreak. On the
other hand they are hard to identify and their identiﬁcation requires an
additional cost. Therefore, for knowledge oriented strategies, more general
cost functions need to be considered. We propose X ≡ V (∞)+R(∞)+α·LT ,
where LT represents the ratio of identiﬁed to the total number of shortcuts
and α is the cost associated with contact tracking.

Figs. 4–5 show ratio of tracked links (top panel), the number of vacci-
nated individuals (middle panel) and cost function X (lower panel), corre-
sponding to the optimal solutions. In the following we examine the inﬂuence
of incubation time, controlled by q, and eﬀectiveness of the vaccination, v,
on the optimal strategy.

For the parameters used in this paper, the cost associated with an op-
timal strategy is generated mainly by vaccination and links tracking. The
relative importance of these two factors depends on the cost of tracking
a single long-range link, α′ = α/1023. When links tracking is cheap, it
is optimal to track all shortcuts, see Figs. 4–5 (top panel). When disease
incubation time is long (small q) and vaccination is ineﬃcient (small v) de-
tailed contact tracking is less important and costs are largely inﬂuenced by
treatment, cf. Fig. 4. The combined eﬀect of the long incubation time and

low eﬀectiveness of vaccination decrease the eﬀect the additional knowledge
about long range links has on the control. When the incubation is time
long, epidemics can infect large proportion of individuals before they are
detected. For short incubation times (large q) and more eﬀective treatment
(large v), there is a clear distinction between strategies applying contact
recognition and purely local strategies, cf. Fig. 5. The recognition of short-
cuts, despite the associated costs, can signiﬁcantly decrease the number of
individuals that need to be vaccinated to eradicate epidemics. Furthermore,
such strategies lead to smaller value of the severity index X than purely local
strategies, cf. middle and bottom panels of Fig. 5.

4. Discussion

Designing control strategies for networks incorporating long-range links
is complicated. In the simplest case, we envisage treating infected and/or
susceptible individuals so that the disease progress is slowed down or even
stopped. Examples of such treatment include preventive vaccination, culling
of animals and quarantine of ﬁelds or individuals. For networks with only
short-range interactions the spread of a disease is geographically limited
and can therefore be contained locally [2]. For non-local networks there
is always a possibility of infection jumping to another location to form a
new focus. In designing control strategies for such networks it is necessary
to know not only the geographical location of new cases (so that they and
their immediate neighbors can be treated) but also all possible connections
that can span the whole population. Obtaining this information can be very
expensive and time consuming. With the authorities faced by a large-scale
epidemic the collection of such data might be diﬃcult and might lead to
many inappropriate decisions. It is thus imperative to use epidemiological
models to explore the possibilities of simplifying the control strategies.

Most models of disease spread used to predict its advance and to design
eﬃcient control measures assume a perfect knowledge of both the status
of each individual (healthy vs. infectious) and the network structure (who

10

fens5

acquires the disease from whom [4, 5]). Among the epidemiological pa-
rameters, the diﬀerence between the onset of infectiousness and the earliest
detectability of the disease is the key issue for controlling the disease. For
most diseases an individual can be infectious even though the infection can-
not be detected and controlled. Such an individual can be a source of further
infections for a relatively long time until the source is identiﬁed and con-
trolled by isolation or treatment.
In many cases, even post-symptomatic
individuals cannot be treated straight after the detection, which further
adds to a spread of the epidemic. Control strategies should aim at decreas-
ing the time until control measures are applied by increasing detectability
and speeding up control.

We have shown that long-range links dramatically reduce the eﬀective-
ness of local control measures. Our results show that in some cases it is
possible to control epidemics with only limited knowledge about interac-
tions between individuals. If this is not possible, our model gives guidance
on conditions under which it is advisable to attempt to track long-range
links, despite the high costs associated with such a strategy. From the eco-
nomic point of view, contact tracking is important when disease incubation
time is short and vaccination is eﬃcient. Furthermore, if the epidemics is
highly infectious, knowledge oriented strategies lead to a signiﬁcant decrease
in the severity index characterizing the costs of disease eradication.

There is a clear distinction between the case when the control measure
works and when it does not. If the control neighborhood is too small, or
we track insuﬃcient numbers of long-range links, the disease keeps escap-
ing the treatment and as a result we need to treat practically the whole
population. Making the ring of control even a fraction larger might lead
to a dramatic increase in the eﬃciency of the control strategy. Similarly,
incorporating more long-range links might improve the eﬀectiveness of the
control measures.

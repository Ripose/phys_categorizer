Sociophysics Simulations I: Language Competition

Abstract

Using a bit-string model similar to biological simulations, the com-
petition between diﬀerent languages is simulated both without and
with spatial structure. We compare our agent-based work with dif-
ferential equations and the competing bit-string model of Kosmidis et
al.

1 Introduction and Models

According to the Bible, since the tower of Babylon was destroyed, humans
speak numerous (presently nearly 104) diﬀerent languages. Many of these
face extinction, and a few new ones may arise. Abrams and Strogatz [1] de-
scribed the competition between two languages by simple diﬀerential equa-
tions averaging over all people, an approximation criticized in this Granada
Seminar by Droz. Patriarca and Lepp¨anen [2] applied these methods to a
square lattice, with one language favoured in one half and the other language
in the other half. Other models averaging over many people were published
by Pagel [3] and Briscoe [4].

Two agent-based models, with each person simulated separately, were
proposed independently in [5, 6], using bit-strings as is customary for biolog-
ical species [7]. We shortly review here these agent-based models; a longer
review is given elsewhere [8].

In [5], a language is given by a bit-string such that each diﬀerent bit-string
like 0011 and 1000 represents a diﬀerent language; this model thus simulates
many languages.
In the alternative model [6] for only two languages, the
left part of the bit-string correponds to one and the right part to the other
language; then a person with bit-string 0011 speaks the second language
well, and the ﬁrst not at all, while 1000 speaks the ﬁrst language badly, and
the second not at all. We will later see how a re-interpretation gives good
agreement between these models. Now we concentrate on the model of [5].

2 Size and Lifetime

Fig.1a shows the present histogram of the sizes of human languages, where
the size is the number of people speaking mainly this language [9, 10]. We see
roughly a log-normal distribution, with an enhanced number at small sizes.
Fig.1b shows a simulation made as follows:

At each time step t we determine ﬁrst the fraction xi = Ni(t)/N(t) of
people speaking language i. People ﬂee from rare languages by selecting
with probability 1 − x2
i the language of one randomly selected person from
the N(t) survivors. (In [5] a ﬂight probability (N(t)/N(t = ∞))(1 − xi)2 was
simulated instead.) Then everybody dies with Verhulst probability ∝ N(t)
due to overpopulation. The survivors produce one child each, which learns
the language of the parent except that with probability p one of the ℓ bits in
the bit-string is toggled. We see that the simulation of Fig.1b recovers the
deviation from a log-normal distribution, which would be a parabola in these
log-log plots. On the computer we could simulate more languages than in
reality but not as many people as live now on Earth.

For low mutation probabilities p < 1/4, nearly everybody speaks one
language (which in reality may correspond to the alphabet now in use), with
a few mutants of one bit only: Dominance. For higher mutation probabilities
> 1/4, the population fragments into many diﬀerent languages, whose sizes
do not diﬀer by orders of magnitude and may become equal if the total
population size goes to inﬁnity. Even in the stationary state, languages
continuously face extinction and rebirth, and Fig.2 shows that most of these
languages live only one or a few iterations. Fig.2a holds for dominance and
8 bits, Fig.2b for dominance or fragmentation at 8 or 16 bits, and Fig.2c for
dominance at 16 bits and populations between 1000 and ten million.

We did not forget the fourth data set (fragmentation at 8 bits) in Fig.2b
but there are no extinctions anymore in this case (we counted only extinctions
for 1000 < t < 2000 to get rid of non-equilibrium eﬀects at the beginning.)
The reason may be that for fragmentation we have many languages of roughly
equal sizes, and if we wait long enough each of these languages eventually
will die out accidentally. The larger the population is the longer we have to
wait. And for 8 bits, when the one million simulated people are distributed
among only 28 = 256 languages, the population is higher and the extinction
time much higher than for the 216 = 65536 languages at 16 bits. Thus no
extinctions were seen for 8 bits and fragmentation. On the dominance side at
lower p, at each iteration many mutants are formed diﬀering by one bit only

2

from the preferred language and mutating back to it at as soon as possible;
then we have data for both 8 and 16 bits.

3 Mixing

English has evolved as a mixture from French and German, and indeed start-
ing with two languages we did end up with one [8]. However, this was one of
the two original languages and not a mixture. Kosmidis et al [6], on the other
hand, also got mixture languages where in the simplest case on average each
person takes half of the words from one and the other half from the other
language. In this aspect, their model [6] at ﬁrst seems better. However, a
re-interpretation of our model [5] in their spirit [6] recovers the same mixture
language.

For this purpose we follow [6] and interpret the ﬁrst half of our bit-
string as representing words from French, and the second half as representing
German words. Initially, half the population speaks French and the other
speaks German. In the dominance case, one of these two languages wins,
and nearly everybody speaks it apart from minor variations: Wings in Fig.3.
Nearly everybody has no bits set in one of the two 8-bit halves at ℓ = 16,
and has all 8 bits set in the other half; exceptions are exponentially rare as
seen in Fig.3. For fragmentation instead of dominance, the parabolic curve
in Fig.3 shows nearly identical results for the two halves: The most probable
case is four bits set in one half and four bits set in the other half, which is
the desired mixture.

Kosmidis et al [6] also changed their many parameters such that at the
end nearly all bits were set: These are bilinguals speaking both languages
ﬂuently.

Mixing of populations speaking diﬀerent languages may also happen [2]
if we put the people onto a square lattice, where many people can live on
each site. Nevertheless they can move with probability 0.01 to a neighbour-
ing site, and with probability p accept the language of a randomly selected
person living on the same site. Finally, during a mutation the bit is ﬂipped
randomly with probability 1 − q while with probability q it is taken from
the corresponding bit of another person. (This other person is selected ran-
domly: with probability 1/2 from the same lattice, otherwise from one of the
four neighbours.) Now a stable coexistence of two populations is possible,
the French on one side of Canal Street in New Orleans, and the English on

3

the other side: Fig.4. With an exponentially decaying probability someone
lives as a language minority on the wrong side of the street. The exponen-
tial decay constant, i.e. the interface width, seems to be independent of the
lattice size, in contrast to surface roughening in the 2D Ising model.

4 Summary

Not only our simulations on lattices like Fig.4 required agent - based simula-
tions, instead of diﬀerential equations averaging over the whole population.
Also in the case without such spatial eﬀects a diﬀerential approach for inﬁ-
nite populations would have been problematic: In the thermodynamic limit,
loved by physicists looking for analytic solutions and criticized elsewhere at
this seminar for sociophysics, fragmentation would presumably have resulted
in a delta function of the language size distribution as opposed to Fig.1, and
might have destroyed some phase transitions of [8, 5]

The computer simulation of language competition, as opposed to the
simulation of learning a language by children or of the evolution of the ﬁrst
language out of the sounds of a proto-language, is still in its infancy, both
for mean ﬁeld approaches and for agent-based models. Everybody is invited
to join.

We thank P.M.C. de Oliveira for the suggestion to simulate languages,

and L. Gallos for telling us at this seminar about [6].

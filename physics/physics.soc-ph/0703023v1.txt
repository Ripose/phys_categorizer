Detailed empirical studies of publicly traded business ﬁrms have established that the standard
deviation of annual sales growth rates decreases with increasing ﬁrm sales as a power law, and that
the sales growth distribution is non-Gaussian with slowly decaying tails. To explain these empirical
facts, a theory is developed that incorporates both the ﬂuctuations of a single ﬁrm’s sales and the
statistical diﬀerences among many ﬁrms. The theory reproduces both the scaling in the standard
deviation and the non-Gaussian distribution of growth rates. Earlier models reproduce the same
empirical features by splitting ﬁrms into somewhat ambiguous subunits; by decomposing total sales
into individual transactions, this ambiguity is removed. The theory yields veriﬁable predictions and
accommodates any form of business organization within a ﬁrm. Furthermore, because transactions
are fundamental to economic activity at all scales, the theory can be extended to all levels of the
economy, from individual products to multinational corporations.

INTRODUCTION

In 1931, Gibrat introduced a formal model of market
structure based on his Law of Proportionate Eﬀect, which
describes the time evolution of business ﬁrm size [1, 2].
There is no unique measure of the size of a company;
a ﬁrm’s size is frequently deﬁned to be the total an-
nual sales. Gibrat postulated that all ﬁrms, regardless
of size, have an equal probability to grow a ﬁxed frac-
tion in a given period, i.e., the ﬁrm size undergoes a
multiplicative random walk. Over appropriately chosen
periods, the distribution of the annual fractional size
change is approximately Gaussian, independent of the
ﬁrm size [2]. Gibrat hypothesized that the distribution of
ﬁrm sizes follows a nonstationary lognormal distribution.
Subsequent statistical studies [3, 4] have found that the
ﬁrm-size distribution is well-approximated by a lognor-
mal distribution as predicted. More recent studies [5–10]
have also demonstrated three empirical facts incompati-
ble with Gibrat’s hypothesis: (i) Firm growth rates, de-
ﬁned to be the annual change in the logarithm of sales,
follow a non-Gaussian distribution with slowly decaying
tails, (ii) The standard deviation of growth rates scales
S−β, where

mately stationary over tens of years.

A number of models have been proposed to explain
these incompatibilities between Gibrat’s theory and the

empirical facts. These models decompose each ﬁrm into
ﬂuctuating subunits [11–19], which are usually taken to
be management divisions or product lines. While the
subunits obey simple dynamics, the aggregate entities
approximate the empirically observed statistics. Studies
ranging from the gross domestic product (GDP) of coun-
tries to the sales of individual products have found com-
parable scaling laws and non-Gaussian distributions [16–
21]. While the statistics of GDP growth may be ex-
plained in terms of the contributions of individual ﬁrms,
the ﬁrm sales do not obey simple dynamics. Likewise,
while ﬁrm sales growth may be explained in terms of
the contributions from products, products exhibit com-
plex behavior similar to the entire ﬁrm [16]. Empirically,
no economic entity obeying simple dynamics has been

of Refs. [16–21] with these theoretical models, either a
subunit obeying a postulated simple dynamics must be
identiﬁed, or we must account for the complex nature of
the subunits themselves, as illustrated by the hierarchal
schematic in Fig. 1.

Here we develop a theory to explain the observed ﬁrm
growth statistics that does not invoke an inherently hi-
erarchical model of the economy [5, 11, 35]. We do not
make any assumptions about the internal structure of
ﬁrms. We postulate that the total annual sales of a par-
ticular ﬁrm can be broken down into a ﬁnite sum of indi-
vidual sales transactions. In our analysis, each ﬁrm’s to-
tal annual sales is an independent random variable that
is characterized by three parameters (see below). Fur-
thermore, these parameters vary randomly from ﬁrm to
ﬁrm. We refer to the set of ﬁrms as the population. We

FIG. 1: The GDP of a country is decomposed into the contri-
butions of individual ﬁrms. Firms’ contributions are further
split by individual products, ad inﬁnitum. Because complex
behavior is observed at all scales, models of economies that ex-
plain complex behavior in terms of ﬂuctuating subunits must
account for the composite nature of the subunits themselves.

The log size si is a random variable that is a function
of the random variable Si. To simplify the notation, we
also introduce the logarithms of the expected number of
transactions

deﬁne heterogeneity as a measure of the variability of the
ﬁrms’ parameters within a population.

In Section II, we develop a model of a single ﬁrm’s
sales. In Section III, we quantify heterogeneity in a pop-
ulation of ﬁrms and derive a scaling relationship between
ﬁrm size and the standard deviation of growth rates. Sec-
tion IV studies the distribution of annual growth rates
for a single ﬁrm and approximates the growth distribu-
tion generated by a heterogeneous population. Section V
uses the scaling analysis presented in Sec. III to illustrate
the relationship between the number of products sold by
ﬁrms and ﬁrm sales.

Si ≡
0 and Ti,k > 0 are measured in units of

random variables with ﬁnite moments. The total sales Si
is then a random variable. Firm i may increase its total
sales by increasing its sales volume Ni, or by selling more
expensive products (increasing Ti). The uncertainties in
price and number depend on the nature of the products
that a ﬁrm sells and the market. We consider Poisson-
distributed demand [22–25], where Ni is described by a
Poisson distribution, and we deﬁne

Qi ≡ h

Nii

= var[Ni] .

(2)

With this choice, the size of a ﬁrm Si is a random vari-
able with a compound Poisson distribution, the details
of which depend on the statistics of the individual trans-
actions Ti.

and the mean transaction size

We estimate the ﬁrst moment of si by computing the
expected value of the Taylor series expansion of Eq. (4)

Importantly, the variance in the log size of a ﬁrm is in-

combine Eqs. (4), (8), and (9), to compactly express the

standard deviation,

where ˆη is a random variable that has zero mean and

particular ﬁrm described by the three parameters qi, xi,
and ci.

To compute the statistics of sales growth, recall our
assumption that the annual sales of ﬁrm i is statistically
independent of its sales in the previous year. Let si and

3

Thus, we have deﬁned a ﬁrm’s total sales to be a sum
of a random number of transactions of random size. Each
ﬁrm is uniquely described by its average sales volume and
its transaction sizes, characterized by qi, xi, and ci. The
statistical independence of sales from year to year implies
that the variance in growth rates, Eq. (12), is a simple
function of average sales volume and the transaction size
dispersion.

III. QUANTIFYING HETEROGENEITY IN
THE POPULATION OF FIRMS

FIG. 2: Solid ellipses are the level curves of the bivariate dis-
tribution given in Eq. (15) with ρ = 0. Dashed lines show pos-
sible conﬁgurations of transaction volume and size for ﬁrms
of various sizes. The arrow indicates that the mean log trans-
action quantity increases linearly with log size, in agreement
with Eq. (19).

Prior studies [5–10] examined the statistics of sales
growth within a population of ﬁrms and found that the
standard deviation of growth rates scales as a power law
S−β, and that the distribution of
with ﬁrm sales, σg ∼
growth rates is non-Gaussian with slowly decaying tails.
Analogously, we examine the statistics of sales growth for
a population of ﬁrms. We will ﬁnd that the heterogene-
ity of ﬁrms is fundamental to reproducing the power-law
scaling in the standard deviation of growth rates.

We assume that an individual ﬁrm’s parameters, qi, xi,
and ci, evolve slowly and may be treated as ﬁxed quan-
tities. To introduce heterogeneity within the population,
these parameters are sampled from a time-independent
distribution [28]. In the subsequent discussion, we drop
the subscript i if a parameter is a random variable that
is representative of all ﬁrms (not one ﬁrm in particu-
lar.) Our analysis assumes that the parameter c has ﬁnite
mean
, and that it is statistically independent of the
i
other ﬁrm parameters. The means and variances of the
parameters q and x across the population are denoted by

(16)

The correlation coeﬃcient depends on the industry: a
negative value of ρ implies that ﬁrms that sell smaller
quantities tend to sell more expensive items. The pa-
rameters of Eq. (15) also reﬂect the fact that ﬁrms must
minimize ineﬃciency and risk. Firms with too many
transactions have excess overhead, and ﬁrms with low
volume risk bankruptcy from large sales ﬂuctuations.

We examine the statistics of ﬁrms of a ﬁxed mean size,
savg = q + x = const. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the rela-
tionship between total ﬁrm sales and transactions imply
that statistics that depend on transaction volume qi also
depend on the sizes of the ﬁrms under consideration. For
example, to extend the variance in growth rates given
in Eq. (9) to include all ﬁrms of a ﬁxed size, we must
determine the distribution of q conditioned on savg,

In the present treatment, we note that within a pop-
ulation of ﬁrms of ﬁxed average annual sales, there are
ﬁrms with large numbers of small transactions and vice
versa. Because the variance in growth rates is inversely
proportional to the number of transactions, the hetero-
geneity in transaction volume gives rise to a distribution
in the variance of ﬁrm growth rates. To study the dis-
tribution of growth rates beyond the second moment, we
must estimate the distribution of a ﬁrm’s total sales Si.
In actuarial science and operations research litera-
ture [25, 26], the distribution of Si has been approxi-
mated by the truncated normal, lognormal, and gamma
distributions. For analytical convenience, we approxi-
mate the compound Poisson distribution of ﬁrm sales Si
with a gamma distribution. As required by our theory,
the gamma distribution admits only nonnegative sales,
0, and it is asymptotically Gaussian when the num-
Si ≥
ber of transactions is large, in agreement with the central
limit theorem. The PDF of ﬁrm size Si is assumed to be

In the large-ai limit, we recover the expression for the
variance in Eq. (12). This asymptotic agreement is ex-
pected because in Sec. II we employed a low-order ex-
pansion of the logarithm. Furthermore, because the hy-
perbolic cosine is asymptotically exponential, the tails of
the distribution in Eq. (31) decay exponentially,

The distribution of growth rates for a population must
reﬂect the variability of the parameter a among the ﬁrms.
Formally, the PDF of growth rates for a population is
given by a weighted mixture of the PDFs of single-ﬁrm
growth rates given in Eq. (31). To express this distri-
bution analytically, we assume negligible variance in the
transaction size dispersion, i.e., ci = c is constant. In this
case, the distribution of the parameter a is lognormal,

tent with empirical facts [5, 6, 9].

V. THE SCALING OF PRODUCTS

S0.42 [16].

Power-law scaling relationships are observed in aca-
demic, ecological, technological, and economic systems
that relate a measure of size to the number of con-
stituents [31–37].
For example, the number of dif-
ferent products sold by ﬁrms (the constituents) grows
as a power law in ﬁrm sales (a measure of size),
N

∼
To elucidate the relationship between products and
sales, we adopt the notation of Section III. Let Qi de-
note the number of products within ﬁrm i and let Xi de-
note the ﬁrm’s total annual sales per product. Because
economic conditions are diﬀerent in diﬀerent locales and
industries, we assume that among all ﬁrms, the number
of products Q and the mean sales per product X are

both lognormally distributed random variables. For con-
venience, we drop the subscript on the random variables
and take the logarithm,

S = QX

s = q + x.

(37)

→
The expression for the joint density of q and x is identical
to Eq. (15), except that in this context, the parameters of
the distribution reﬂect aspects of the product portfolios
of ﬁrms.

From Eqs. (24) and (25), we ﬁnd that the mean number
of products and the mean product size scale as power laws
with average ﬁrm size,

VI. DISCUSSION

The present model of ﬁrm size ﬂuctuations produces a
non-Gaussian distribution of growth rates and generates
a stationary lognormal distribution of ﬁrm sizes, features
consistent with empirical studies. Our approach bears
similarity to the model proposed in Ref. [12] in which a
ﬁrm is split into subunits that each obey simple dynam-
ics. In the present work, the number of transactions is
analogous to the number of subunits, and the transaction
size parallels the sizes of the subunits within a ﬁrm. The
model of Ref. [12] postulates a complex internal structure
within a ﬁrm. In contrast, our approach decomposes a
ﬁrm’s sales into the individual transactions that occur in
a year.

Because transactions are well-deﬁned measurable
quantities, the assumptions and predictions of the theory
are veriﬁable. In practice, correlations between transac-
tions invalidate our assumption that the number of trans-
actions Ni follows a Poisson distribution. Indeed, trans-
actions within a ﬁrm can be regrouped to remove cor-
relations. Because these uncorrelated groups satisfy the
assumptions of our model, we conclude that a Poisson-
distributed number of transactions is not strictly neces-
sary to obtain the results presented here. To retain our
transactional framework, one can extend the model of a
single ﬁrm’s statistics described in Section II to account
for correlations between transactions at the expense of
additional parameters [24]. Independent of the statistical
details, most measures of microeconomic and macroeco-
nomic consumption tally individual transactions and are
therefore amenable to the transactional approach pre-
sented here. Figuratively speaking, transactions are the
‘atoms’ of economic activity: they are discrete and are

6

the basis of economies of all scales, from the individual
to the national.

Using our approach, we studied the relationship be-
tween the number of diﬀerent products sold by ﬁrms and
total sales receipts. We found that diﬀerences between
ﬁrms could account for the reported scaling relationship
avg. Our anal-
Q
between the two quantities,
h
ysis applies to many systems where two distinct mea-
sures of size are related by a proportionality constant that
varies because of economic, environmental, and other ac-
cidental circumstances. When the relationship between
the measures is weak, the population is heterogeneous
and non-trivial power laws emerge [35]. For example,
both transaction volume and total sales quantify the size
of a ﬁrm, but no strict universal proportionality between
these quantities exists. In this case, Eq. (24) predicts a
power-law relationship between the quantities. In ecol-
ogy, both island surface area and number of species quan-
tify island size: islands with greater area generally har-
bor more species. However, the mix of species and the
number distinct niches varies from island to island. In
agreement with our hypothesis, empirical studies show

island area S
0.2 [32, 33, 36]. Other studies
have found that the density of Internet routers scale as a
power law with population density, R
1.4 [37].
In our treatment, the particular exponent is a function
of the heterogeneity in the Internet architecture deployed
within a study region.

In summary, we have presented a theory of ﬁrm size
ﬂuctuations that explains a number of reported statistics
in economics. The analysis also represents an important
null hypothesis because it suggests that some emergent
statistics are a consequence of heterogeneity in the pop-
ulation of ﬁrms. For these systems, understanding and
quantifying heterogeneity seems to be the central prob-
lem in understanding macroscopic ﬁrm statistics.

APPENDIX A: STATISTICS OF BINNING

Frequently, empirical analysis of data cannot select a
signiﬁcant set of ﬁrms of a ﬁxed size. The usual remedy
is to bin by selecting data within a range of sizes. Be-
cause the range may be large, the conditional statistics
may change. For example, we examine the conditional
mean and variance of q, for the subset of ﬁrms in the
smax. Within the bin, the distribution
bin smin ≤

savg ≤

of savg is a complicated function of smin and smax. We
denote the average of the log mean size of ﬁrms within

the bin is denoted by var[savg |
pectation
given in Eq. (19) is linear in savg, con-

sequently, binning has no impact on the calculation of
the conditional ﬁrst moment. The variance of q for the
set of ﬁrms within the bin is given by

have binned ﬁrms such that the variance in ﬁrms’ log

thermore, because the mean and variance of q is reﬂected
in the parameters M and V in Eq. (34), this implies that
the distribution of growth rates also has a non-trivial de-
pendence on bin width.

In equilibrium, viable ﬁrms cannot sustain large sales
ﬂuctuations, so a

We approximate the second integral in Eq. (B1) using

To examine the large-g behavior of Eq. (35), note that

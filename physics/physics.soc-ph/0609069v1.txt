We study here numerically the behavior of an ideal gas like model of markets having only one
non-consumable commodity. We investigate the behavior of the steady-state distributions of money,
commodity and total wealth, as the dynamics of trading or exchange of money and commodity
proceeds, with local (in time) ﬂuctuations in the price of the commodity. These distributions are
studied in markets with agents having uniform and random saving factors. The self-organizing
features in money distribution are similar to the cases without any commodity (or with consumable
commodities), the commodity distribution shows an exponential decay. The wealth distribution
shows interesting behavior: Gamma like distribution for uniform saving propensity and has the
same power-law tail, as that of the money distribution for a market with agents having random
saving propensity.

INTRODUCTION

The study of wealth distribution [1] in a society has re-
mained an intriguing problem since Vilfredo Pareto who
ﬁrst observed [2] that the number of rich people with
wealth m decay following an inverse power-law:

P (m) ∼ m−(1+ν).

(1)

P (m) is the number density of people possessing wealth
m and ν is known as the Pareto exponent. This exponent
generally assumes a value between 1 and 3 in diﬀerent
economies and times [1, 3, 4, 5]. It is also known that
for low and medium income, the number density P (m)
falls oﬀ much faster: exponentially [3] or in a log-normal
way [4].

In recent years, easy availability of data in electronic
media has helped in the analysis of wealth or income
distributions in various societies [1]. It is now more or
less established that the distribution has a power-law tail
for the large (about 5% of the population) wealth/income
while the majority (around 95%) low income distribution
ﬁts well to Gibbs or log-normal form [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].

There have been several attempts to model a simple
economy with minimum trading ingredients, which in-
volve a wealth exchange process [1] that produce a distri-
bution of wealth similar to that observed in the real mar-
ket. We are particularly interested in microscopic models
of markets where the (economic) trading activity is con-
sidered as a scattering process [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]
(see also Ref. [15] for a recent extensive review). We
concentrate on models that incorporate ‘saving propen-
sity’ (of the agents) as an essential ingredient in a trading
process, and reproduces the salient features seen across
wealth distributions in varied economies (see Ref. [16] for

a review). Much earlier, Angle [17] studied an inequal-
ity process, which can be mapped to the uniform savings
models is certain cases; see Ref. [18] for a detailed review.
These studies also show (and discussed brieﬂy here)
how the distribution of savings can be modiﬁed to re-
produce the salient features of empirical distributions of
wealth – namely the shape of the distribution for the low
and middle wealth and the tunable Pareto exponent. In
all these models [9, 10, 11, 12, 13], ‘savings’ was intro-
duced as a quenched parameter that remained invariant
with time (or trading).

Apart from presenting a brief summary in Section II,
the established results in such models, we present new
results for a similar (gas like) market model, where the
exchange is for a non-consumable commodity (globally
conserved, like money). We ﬁnd, although the details of
the steady-state money and wealth (money and commod-
ity together) distributions diﬀer considerably, the same
Pareto tail feature appears in both, with identical expo-
nent (ν) value.

IDEAL-GAS LIKE MODELS OF TRADING

MARKETS WITHOUT ANY COMMODITY

A. Without savings

We ﬁrst consider an ideal-gas model of a closed eco-
nomic system. Wealth is measured in terms of the
amount of money possessed by an individual. Production
is not allowed i.e, total money M is ﬁxed and also there
is no migration of population i.e, total number of agents
N is ﬁxed, and the only economic activity is conﬁned to
trading. Each agent i, individual or corporate, possess
money mi(t) at time t. In any trading, a pair of agents i
and j randomly exchange their money [7, 8, 9], such that
their total money is (locally) conserved and none posses
negative money (mi(t) ≥ 0, i.e, debt not allowed):

mi(t + 1) = mi(t) + ∆m; mj(t + 1) = mj(t) − ∆m

∆m = ǫ(mi(t) + mj(t)) − mi(t); 0 ≤ ǫ ≤ 1

(2)

All the money transactions considered in this paper fol-
low local conservation:

mi(t) + mj(t) = mi(t + 1) + mj(t + 1).

(3)

The time (t) changes by one unit after each trading and ǫ
is a random fraction chosen for each trading. The steady-
state (t → ∞) distribution of money is Gibbs one:

P (m) = (1/T ) exp(−m/T ); T = M/N.

(4)

No matter how uniform or justiﬁed the initial distribu-
tion is, the eventual steady state corresponds to Gibbs
distribution where most of the people have very little
money. This follows from the conservation of money and
additivity of entropy:

P (m1)P (m2) = P (m1 + m2).

This steady state result is quite robust and realistic. Sev-
eral variations of the trading [1], does not aﬀect the dis-
tribution.

In any trading, savings come naturally [19]. A sav-
ing factor λ is therefore introduced in the same model [9]
(Ref. [8] is the model without savings), where each trader
at time t saves a fraction λ of its money mi(t) and trades
In each of the following two
randomly with the rest.
cases, the savings fraction does not vary with time, and
hence we call it ‘quenched’ in the terminology of statis-
tical mechanics.

B. Uniform savings

For the case of ‘uniform’ savings, the money exchange

mi(t + 1) = mi(t) + ∆m; mj(t + 1) = mj(t) − ∆m (5)

rules are:

where

∆m = (1 − λ)[ǫ{mi(t) + mj(t)} − mi(t)],

(6)

where ǫ is a random fraction, coming from the stochastic
nature of the trading. λ is a fraction (0 ≤ λ < 1) which
we call the saving factor.

The market (non-interacting at λ = 0 and 1) becomes
eﬀectively ‘interacting’ for any non-vanishing λ (< 1):
For uniform λ (same for all agents), the steady state dis-
tribution Pf (m) of money is sharply decaying on both
sides with the most-probable money per agent shifting
away from m = 0 (for λ = 0) to M/N as λ → 1.
The self-organizing feature of this market, induced by
sheer self-interest of saving by each agent without any
global perspective, is very signiﬁcant as the fraction of
paupers decrease with saving fraction λ and most peo-
ple possess some fraction of the average money in the

2

market (for λ → 1, the socialists’ dream is achieved with
just people’s self-interest of saving!). This uniform saving
propensity does not give the Pareto-like power-law dis-
tribution yet, but the Markovian nature of the scattering
or trading processes (eqn. (5)) is lost and the system be-
comes co-operative. Through λ, the agents indirectly get
to develop a correlation with (start interacting with) each
other and the system co-operatively self-organizes [20] to-
wards a most-probable distribution.

This model has been understood to a certain extent
(see e.g, [21, 22, 23]), and argued to resemble a gamma
distribution [22], and partly explained analytically. This
model clearly ﬁnds its relevance in cases where the econ-
omy consists of traders with ‘waged’ income [24].

C. Distributed savings

In a real society or economy, λ is a very inhomogeneous
parameter: the interest of saving varies from person to
person. We move a step closer to the real situation where
saving factor λ is widely distributed within the popula-
tion [11, 12, 13]. The evolution of money in such a trading
can be written as:

mi(t + 1) = λimi(t) + ǫij

× [(1 − λi)mi(t) + (1 − λj)mj(t)] , (7)

mj(t + 1) = λjmj(t) + (1 − ǫij)

× [(1 − λi)mi(t) + (1 − λj)mj(t)] (8)

One again follows the same rules as before, except that

∆m = ǫij(1 − λj)mj (t) − (1 − λi)(1 − ǫij )mi(t)

(9)

here; λi and λj being the saving propensities of agents
i and j. The agents have uniform (over time) saving
propensities, distributed independently, randomly and
uniformly (white) within an interval 0 to 1 agent i saves
a random fraction λi (0 ≤ λi < 1) and this λi value is
quenched for each agent (λi are independent of trading
or t). P (m) is found to follow a strict power-law decay.
This decay ﬁts to Pareto law (1) with ν = 1.01 ± 0.02 for
several decades. This power law is extremely robust: a
distribution

ρ(λ) ∼ |λ0 − λ|α, λ0 6= 1, 0 ≤ λ < 1,

(10)

of quenched λ values among the agents produce power
law distributed m with Pareto index ν = 1, irrespective
of the value of α. For negative α values, however, we
get an initial (small m) Gibbs-like decay in P (m).
In
case λ0 = 1, the Pareto exponent is modiﬁed to ν =
1 + α, which qualiﬁes for the non-universal exponents in
the same model [11, 25].

This model [11] has been thoroughly analyzed, and the
analytical derivation of the Pareto exponent has been
achieved in certain cases [23, 25, 26]. The Pareto expo-
nent has been derived to exactly 1.

In this model, agents with higher saving propensity
tend to hold higher average wealth, which is justiﬁed by
the fact that the saving propensity in the rich population
is always high [28].

III.

IDEAL-GAS TRADING MARKET IN

PRESENCE OF A NON-CONSUMABLE
COMMODITY

In the above markets, modiﬁcations due to exchange
of a consumable commodity hardy aﬀects the distribu-
tion, as the commodity once bought or sold need not be
accounted for. Consumable commodities eﬀectively have
no ‘price’, as due to their short lifetime to contribute to
the total wealth of an individual. It is interesting how-
ever, to study the role of non-consumable commodities
in such market models and this we do here.

P

In the simpliﬁed version of a market with a single non-
consumable commodity, we again consider a ﬁxed num-
ber of traders/agents N who trade in a market contain-
i mi(t) = M and total commodity
ing total money
i ci(t) = C, mi(t) and ci(t) being the money and com-
modity of the i-th agent at time t and are both non-
P
nagative. Needless to mention, both mi(t) and ci(t)
change with time or trading t. The market, as before
is closed, which means, N , M and C are constants. The
wealth wi of an individual i is thus, the sum of the money
and commodity it possesses, i.e., wi = mi +p0ci; p0 is the
price. In course of trading, total money and total com-
modity are locally conserved, and hence the total wealth.
In such a market, one can deﬁne a global average price
parameter p0 = M/C, which is set here to unity, giving
wi = mi + ci. It may be noted here that in order to avoid
the complication of restricting the commodity-money ex-
change and their reversal between the same agents, the
Fisher velocity of money circulation (see e.g., Ref. [29])
In order to accommo-
is renormalised to unity here.
date the lack of proper information and the ability of
the agents to bargain etc., we will allow ofcourse ﬂuctu-
ations δ in the price of the commodities at any trading
(time): p(t) = p0 ± δ = 1 ± δ. We ﬁnd, the nature of
steady state to be unchanged and independent of δ, once
it becomes nonvanishing. This allowance of price ﬂuctu-
ation here is very crucial for the model; it allows for the
stochastic dynamics to play its proper role in the market.
As such, this model is therefore quite diﬀerent from that
considered recently in Ref. [30], where p0 is strictly unity
and the stochasticity enters from other exogenic factors.

A. Dynamics

In general, the dynamics of money in this market looks
the same as Eqns. (2), (5) or (7), depending on whether
λi = 0 for all, λi 6= 0 but unifrom for all i or λi 6= λj
respectively. However, all ∆m are not allowed here; only

(13)

The role of the stochasticity in p(t) is to immitate the
eﬀect of bargaining in a trading process. δ parametrizes
the amount of stochasticity. The role of δ is signiﬁcant
in the sense that it determines the (relaxation) time the
whole system takes to reach a dynamically equilibrium
state; the system reaches equlibrium sooner for larger
δ, while its magnitude does not aﬀect the steady state
distribution. It may be noted that, in course of trading
process, certain exchanges are not allowed (e.g., in cases
when a particular pair of traders do not have enough
commodity to exchange in favour of an agreed exchange
of money). We then skip these steps and choose a new
pair of agents for trading.

B. Results

In an ideal gas market without savings, money is ex-
ponetially distributed in presence of any ﬁnite value of δ.

R

Again, commodity has a small initial peak before decay-
ing exponentially. However, the total wealth w = m + c
has a form of a Gamma distribution.

For δ = 0, however, wealth of each agent remains in-
variant with time as only the proportion of money and
commodity interchange within themselves, as the ‘price’
factor remains constant. This of course happens irre-
spective of the savings factor being zero, uniform or dis-
tributed. For δ = 0, the steady state distribution of
money or commodity can take non-trivial forms:
see
Fig. 1, but strictly a δ-function for total wealth, or at

the value of wealth one starts with (see inset of Fig. 1 for
the case mi = 1 = ci for all i).

As mentioned already for δ 6= 0, the steady state re-
sults are not dependent on the value of δ, the relaxation
time of course decreases with increasing δ. In such a mar-
ket with uniform savings, money distribution P (m) has
a form similar to a set (for λ 6= 0) of Gamma functions
(see Fig. 2): a set of curves with a most-probable value
shifting from 0 to 1 as saving factor λ changes from 0 to
1 (as in the case without commodity). The commodity
distribution P (c) has an initial peak and an exponential

fall-oﬀ, without much systematics with varying λ (see
inset of Fig. 2). The distribution P (w) of total wealth
w = m + c behaves much like P (m) (see Fig. 3). It is
to be noted that since there is no precise correspondence
with commodity and money for δ 6= 0 (unlike when δ = 0,
when the sum is ﬁxed), P (w) cannot be derived directly
from P (m) and P (c). However, there are further inter-
esting features. Although they form a class of Gamma
distributions, the set of curves for diﬀerent values of sav-
ing factor λ seem to intersect at a common point, near
w = 1. All the reported data are for a system of N = 100
agents, with M/N = 1 and C/N = 1 and for a case where
the noise level δ equals 1.

For λ distributed uniformly within the interval 0 ≤
λ < 1, the tails of both money and wealth distributions
P (m) and P (w) have Pareto law behavior with a ﬁtting
exponet value ν = 1 ± 0.02 and ν = 1 ± 0.05 respectively
(see Figs. 4 and 5 respectively), whereas the commodity
distribution is still exponentially decaying (see inset of
Fig. 4).

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

Let us ﬁrst summarize the results for the models
without any commodity (money-only exchange models):
There are N players participating in a game, each hav-
ing an initial capital of one unit of money. N is very
large, and total money M = N remains ﬁxed over the
game (so also the number of players N ). (a) In the sim-
plest version, the only move at any time is that two of
these players are randomly chosen and they decide to
share their total money randomly among them. As one
can easily guess, the initial uniform (a delta function)
distribution of money will soon disappear. Let us ask
what the eventual steady state distribution of money af-
ter many such moves will be? At each move, a pair of
randomly chosen players share a random fraction of their
total money among themselves. The answer is well es-
tablished in physics for more than a century — soon,
there will be a stable money distribution and it will be
Gibbs distribution: P (m) ∼ exp[−m/T ]; T = M/N [8].
(b) Now think of a modiﬁed move in this game: each
player ‘saves’ a fraction λ of the money available with
him/her after each move and while going to the next
move. Everybody saves the same fraction λ. What is the
steady state distribution of money after a large number
of such moves? It becomes Gamma-function like, while
the distribution parameters of course depend on λ (see
Ref. [9, 22]) see also Ref. [17, 18]; for a somewhat diﬀerent
model with similar results developed much earlier. No ex-
act treatment of this problem is available so far. (c) What
happens to the eventual money distribution among these
players if λ is not the same for all players but is diﬀerent

5

for diﬀerent players? Let the distribution ρ(λ) of saving
propensity λ be such that ρ(λ) is non-vanishing when
λ → 1. The actual distribution will depend on the sav-
ing propensity distribution ρ(λ), but for all of them, the
asymptotic form of the distribution will become Pareto-
like: P (m) ∼ m−α; α = 2 for m → ∞. This is valid
for all such distributions (unless ρ(λ) ∝ (1 − λ)β, when
P (m) ∼ m−(2+β)). However, for variation of ρ(λ) such
that ρ(λ) → 0 for λ < λ0, one will get an initial Gamma
function form for P (m) for small and intermediate val-
ues of m, with parameters determined by λ0 (6= 0), and
this distribution will eventually become Pareto-like for
m → ∞ [11, 12, 23]. A somewhat rigorous analytical
tretment of this problem is now available [25].

A major limitation of these money-only exchange mod-
els considered earlier [1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,
16, 17, 18, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27] (and summarised in (a),
(b) and (c) above) is that it does not make any explicit
reference to the commodities exchanged with the money
and to the constraints they impose. Also, the wealth is
not just the money is possession (unless the commod-
ity exchanged with the money is strictly consumable).
Here, we study the eﬀect of a single non-consumable com-
modity on the money (and also wealth) distributions in
the steady state. Inspite of many signiﬁcant eﬀects, the
general feature of Gamma-like form of the money (and
wealth) distributions (for uniform λ) and the power law
tails for both money and wealth with identical exponents,
are seen to remain unchanged. The precise studies (the-
ories) for the money-only exchange models are therefore
extremely useful and relevant.

Speciﬁcally, here we study here numerically the behav-
ior of an ideal gas like model of markets having only one
non-consumable commodity. We investigate the behav-
ior of the steady-state distributions of money, commodity
and total wealth, as the dynamics of trading or exchange
of money or commodity proceeds, allowing for tempo-
ral ﬂuctuations in the price of the commodity. These
distributions are studied in markets with agents having
uniform and random saving factors. The self-organizing
features in money distribution are similar to the cases
without any commodity (or with consumable commodi-
ties), the commodity distribution shows an exponential
decay. The wealth distribution shows interesting behav-
ior: Gamma like distribution for uniform saving propen-
sity and has a power-law tail for a market with agents
having random saving propensity.

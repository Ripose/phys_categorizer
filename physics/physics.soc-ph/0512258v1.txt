Nonlinear Averaging in Economics

V. P. Maslov∗

Abstract

Kolmogorov nonlinear averaging is complemented by a natural ax-
iom. For this averaging, we prove a theorem on large deviations as
well as establish the relationship to the tunnel canonical operator

1 Kolmogorov nonlinear averaging

A sequence of functions Mn deﬁnes a regular type of average if the
following conditions are satisﬁed (Kolmogorov):

I. M (x1, x2, . . . , xn) is continuous and monotone in each variable; to
be deﬁnite, we assume that M is increasing in each variable;

II. M (x1, x2, . . . , xn) is a symmetric function1;
III. the average of identical numbers is equal to their common value:

M (x, x, . . . , x) = x;

IV. a group of values can be replaced by their own average, without

changing the overall average:

M (x1, . . . , xm, y1, . . . , yn) = Mn+m(x, . . . , x, y1, . . . , yn),

where x = M (x1, . . . , xm).

Theorem 1.1 (Kolmogorov) If conditions I–IV are satisﬁed, the
average M (x1, x2, . . . , xn) is of the form

M (x1, x2, . . . , xn) = ψ

ϕ(x1) + ϕ(x2) +

+ ϕ(xn)

2 Main axiom of averaging

For a stable system, it is fairly obvious that the following axiom must
be satisﬁed:

V. if the same quantity ω is added to each xk, then the average will

increase by the same amount ω.

I have had a detailed discussion of this axiom with the practicing
economist V. N. Baturin.

Obviously, in normal conditions, the nonlinear average of xi must

also increase by this amount. We take this fact as Axiom V.

This axiom leads to a unique solution in the nonlinear case, i.e., it
is naturally satisﬁed in the linear case (the arithmetic mean) and by a
unique (up to an identical constant by which we can multiply all the
incomes xi) nonlinear function.

In fact, the incomes xi are calculated in some currency and, in
general, must be multiplied by some constant β corresponding to the
purchasing power of this currency, so that this constant (the parame-
ter β) must be incorporated into the deﬁnition of an income. There-
fore, we assert that there exists a unique nonlinear function satisfying
Axiom V.

The function ϕ(x) is of the form

ϕ(x) = C exp(Dx) + B,

(2)

where C, D

= 0, and B are numbers independent of x.

3 Semiring: an example of a linear
self-adjoint operator

Consider the semiring generated by the nonlinear average and the
space L2 with values in this semiring.
First, consider the heat equation

∂u
∂t

=

h

∂2u
∂x2 .

Here h is a small parameter, whose smallness is not needed at this
point.

(5)

(6)

Equation (3) is linear. As is well known, this means that if u1

and u2 are its solutions, then their linear combination

is also its solution. Here λ1 and λ2 are constants.
Next, we make the following substitution. Let

u = λ1u1 + λ2u2

u = e−M/h.

Then the new unknown function M (x, t) satisﬁes the nonlinear equa-
tion

(cid:19)
This well known equation is sometimes called the B¨urgers equation 2.
To the solution u1 of Eq. (3) there corresponds the solution M1 =
h ln u1 of Eq. (6) and to the solution u2 of Eq. (3) there corresponds
h ln u2 of Eq. (6). To the solution (4) of Eq. (3)

on our planet to learn new arithmetical operations, because we can,

to x and substituting v = ∂M/∂x.

by a change of function, pass from Eq. (6) to Eq. (3), which is linear
in the accepted meaning. However, it turns out that the “kingdom of
crooked mirrors,” which this semiring yields, is related to “capitalist”
economics [2].

4 Theorem on the nonlinear average

Consider a collection of prices λi, where i = 1, . . . , n, and a collec-
tion of numbers gi equal to the number of ﬁnancial instruments (FI),
which are shares, bonds, etc., of diﬀerent types having the price λi.
The prices λi are, by deﬁnition, positive numbers; without loss of gen-
erality, we can further assume that the prices are numbered so as to
satisfy the inequalities

In other words, the contribution to the average expenditure of the buyer
from the number Nα of the purchased FI’s (of the order of N ), which
Nα(β, N ) by a value O(N 3/4+δ), is of exponentially small
diﬀers from
value.

Thus, for the case in which the FIs can be divided into suﬃciently
large groups (condition (22)), given a ﬁxed nonlinear average expen-
diture of the buyer, the number of purchased FIs belonging to the
Nα(β, N ), which is
group α is, in most cases, approximately equal to
an analog of the law of large numbers.
To ﬁnd β, we propose the following method. Suppose we are given
, m,

a collection N a
α of actual purchases from the group α, α = 1, 2,
of ﬁnancial instruments. Consider the following function of β:

(cid:0)

(29)

where
the function (29) attains its minimum.

Nα(β, να) is given by (24). For β we take the value for which
The minimum of this value, which can be speciﬁed, for example, at
the stock exchange, shows the degree of randomness of the distribution
of FIs over the portfolios of the traders. If the minimum is zero, then
the distribution over the portfolios is random (see [3]).

Before proving the theorem, we shall prove several assertions and

lemmas.

Suppose that the buyer possesses a sum of money B (budget re-
straint), but not all of this sum is necessarily spent on purchases;
suppose that the buyer purchases N FIs. The total number of dif-
ferent types of purchase corresponding to the N purchased FIs when
the sum of money spent does not exceed B can be expressed by the
formula [4]

In order to prove certain properties of the function Γ(β, N ) (see (26)),

Proof. Let us prove the lemma by induction. First, we prove
If l = 2 and x2 = x1, then, for all

that (43) is valid for l = 2.
nonnegative integers N , the function (42) is equal to

z2(x1, x1; N ) =

and it can be veriﬁed by elementary means that, in that case, in-
= x1, then, for all nonnegative
equality (43) holds. If l = 2 and x2 6
integers N , the function (42) is of the form

z2(x1, x2; N ) =

(44)

Substituting (44) into (43), after a few manipulations we ﬁnd that,
in the case under consideration, inequality (43) is equivalent to the
following inequality:

ex1−x2 + ex2−x1

> 1.

(45)

(cid:1)

However, since the function y(x) = exp(x) is convex, inequality (45)
holds for all numbers x1 and x2 not equal to one another. Thus,
inequality (43) is proved for l = 2. Next, suppose that inequality (43)
is proved for l = k, where k

holds for n = l + 1. Note that the functions (42) possess the following

and hence all summands on the left-hand side of inequality (47) are
positive, i.e., inequality (47) holds. Thus, the validity of (43) for
l = k + 1 is proved and, therefore, the assertion of the lemma is also
proved by induction.

Lemma 1 implies the convexity of the logarithm of the function

Γ(β, N ) (given by (26)) with respect to the discrete variable N .

Proposition 4.5 For all natural numbers N and all positive num-
bers β, the following inequalities hold:

Γ(β, N )2 > Γ(β, N

1)Γ(β, N + 1),

Γ(β, N

1) < eβλ1 Γ(β, N ).

Proof. To prove these inequalities, it suﬃces to note that, in view

of formula (15), Γ(β, N ) (26) can be written in the form

Thus, inequality (49) is a consequence of (43) and, to prove (50), it
suﬃces to use relation (46).

Property (49) implies another property of Γ(β, N ).

Proposition 4.6 For any given positive β and for any nonnegative

integer N , there exists a number ν >

However, the validity of inequalities (55) implies that of inequality (53)
for all N ′

= N . The proposition is proved.

Next, let us prove another lemma, which gives an estimate of the
nonlinear average (15) via relation (37). Suppose that pl, l = 0, 1, . . . ,
is a sequence of numbers satisfying the conditions

words, there exists an index, which will be denoted by L, such that
the following condition is satisﬁed:

pL ≥

for all

l = 0, 1, . . . .

Relations (85), (94), and (100) yield (27). The theorem is proved.

Here we have studied the case β > 0. In exactly the same way, we

may consider the case β < 0. If we take ν <

5 The tunnel canonical operator in eco-
nomics

Equilibrium prices are determined from the condition of the equality
between supply and demand in each commodity and resource. Simi-
larly, the following pairs are determined: “ﬂows of commodities and

21

services–prices”; “ﬂows of labor resources–level of wages”; “ﬂows of
natural resources–rents”; and “loan interest rate–loan volume.”

The asymptotics of M and

M is given by the tunnel canonical

operator in the phase space of pairs [5].

We consider the phase space R2n, where the intensive quantities
f
play the role of coordinates and the extensive ones, of momenta. In
economics, the role of the values of the random variable λi can be
played by the prices of the corresponding commodities and Ni is, for
example, the number of commodities sold, i.e., the number of peo-
ple who have bought of this commodity or the bank rate of the ith
bank, etc. Obviously, the price depends on the demand, i.e., λi(Ni)
is a curve in two-dimensional phase space. In two-dimensional phase
space, to each point (vector) λi, i = 1, . . . , n, there corresponds a vec-
tor Ni(λ1, . . . , λn), i = 1, . . . , n. In a more general case, we deal with
an N @-dimensional manifold (surface), where the “coordinates” and
the “momenta” locally depend on n parameters and, moreover, a cer-
tain condition holds: the Lagrange brackets of the “coordinates” and
of “the momenta” with respect to these parameters are zero. There-
fore, the author has called such a manifold Lagrangian. In other words,
Ni dλi is closed (see the concluding re-
we can say that the form
Nidλi is independent of the path and,
marks in [6] and [7]). Hence
P
just as in mechanics,
p dq (p is the momentum, q is the coordinate),
R
can be called an action.

The producer buys resources and transforms a resource expendi-
ture vector into a commodity production vector. The consumer buys
these commodities. Accordingly, the equilibrium prices for resources
and for consumer goods are determined by the equalities given above
(see also [8]–[17]).

R

In addition to such equilibrium prices, vertical pairs of isolated con-
sumer goods and pairs “seller–buyer,” i.e., “permanent seller–permanent
buyer,” can also be formed and the corresponding prices related to
this pairs are generated. The analog in quantum statistics are Cooper
pairs.

This construction requires the use of the ultrasecond quantization
method in an abstract algebraic form which could be applicable in
economics. Such a theory leads to the formation of “vertical” clusters.
The method in question is developed in another paper.

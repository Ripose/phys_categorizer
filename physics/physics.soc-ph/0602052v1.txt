Abstract. We consider the roughness properties of NYSE (New York Stock Exchange) stock-price ﬂuc-

tuations. The statistical properties of the data are relatively homogeneous within the same day but the

large jumps between diﬀerent days prevent the extension of the analysis to large times. This leads to

intrinsic ﬁnite size eﬀects which alter the apparent Hurst (H) exponent. We show, by analytical methods,

that ﬁnite size eﬀects always lead to an enhancement of H. We then consider the eﬀect of fat tails on

the analysis of the roughness and show that the ﬁnite size eﬀects are strongly enhanced by the fat tails.

The non stationarity of the stock price dynamics also enhances the ﬁnite size eﬀects which, in principle,

can become important even in the asymptotic regime. We then compute the Hurst exponent for a set of

stocks of the NYSE and argue that the interpretation of the value of H is highly ambiguous in view of the

above results. Finally we propose an alternative determination of the roughness in terms of the ﬂuctuations

from moving averages with variable characteristic times. This permits to eliminate most of the previous

problems and to characterize the roughness in useful way. In particular this approach corresponds to the

automatic elimination of trends at any scale.

1 Introduction

The dynamics and ﬂuctuations of stock-prices is repre-

sented, at the simplest level, by a random walk which

guarantees for the basic property of an eﬃcient market.

In the past years it has become clear that one faces a

rather subtle and complex form of random walk. Simple

correlations of price change are indeed zero at the short-

est time but many other features, often related to power

on the deviation from a suitable moving average and it

resolves various ambiguities of the Hurst approach.

The paper is organized in the following way:

In Section 2 we discuss the database for the high fre-

quency samples. This will lead to a crucial role of ﬁnite

size eﬀects because the data are relatively homogeneous

within the same day but there is a large gap in price be-

tween the closing of one day and the opening of the next

preeminent one may mention the power law distributions

of returns (“fat tails”) and the volatility clustering [2, 3].

These properties, however, are far from exhaustive and

other approaches have been introduced in the attempt of

describing the subtle correlations of stock-price dynamics.

One of these methods is the attempt to characterize

the “roughness” of the dynamics which can provide addi-

tional information with respect to the fat tails and volatil-

ity. The scaling properties of the roughness can be deﬁned

via the so called Hurst exponent H [3]. We consider the

roughness problem for high frequency NYSE stock-prices.

This means that we take into account all the transactions

which occur (tick by tick).

First we discuss the statistical properties of the data

set and show that ﬁnite size eﬀects are unavoidable and

very important. Then we show that fat tails and corre-

lations aﬀect the value of the Hurst exponent in an im-

portant way. Finally we analyze the real stock-price ﬂuc-

In Section 3 we discuss the general problem associated

to the determination of the roughness via the Hurst expo-

nent in view of the anisotropic scaling.

In Section 4 we consider the ﬁnite size eﬀects on the

roughness exponent in random walks with an analytical

approach and then include also the possible eﬀects of fat

tails and correlations with Monte Carlo simulations.

In Section 5 we present the roughness analysis for s

selection of NYSE stock-prices also as a function of time.

In Section 6 we critically analyze the scaling assump-

tion in relation to the roughness and consider new tools

to this purpose which eliminate the trends at all scales

This enhancement can be understood by considering that, in

some sense, a single step would correspond to H = 1, so the

asymptotic value H = 1/2 is approached from above.

The generalized Hurst exponent Hq can be deﬁned

from the scaling behavior of Gq(τ ):

The fact that apparently diﬀerent proﬁles with respect

to the roughness lead to value of H which are very similar

is due to a variety of reasons. The overall enhancement

can observe that the slope is similar for the two cases and, at

random walk models as examples. We have computed the

eﬀective Hurst exponent as a function of the size of the

system. The basic result is that the ﬁnite size eﬀects lead

to a systematic enhancement of the eﬀective Hurst expo-

nent and this tendency is ampliﬁed by the inclusion of fat

tails and eventual correlations.

An analysis of real stock-price behavior leads to the

relatively large scale (τ ) even the amplitudes become rather

similar. (b) In this case the amplitudes are deﬁned by the ﬂuc-

tuations from the moving averages as given by Eq. (15). In

this case there is a marked diﬀerence in slope and even more

in amplitude. This example clariﬁes that this new deﬁnition of

roughness can be more useful to classify the stock dynamics.

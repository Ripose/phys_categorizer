Cascading breakdowns of real networks are severe accidents in recent years, such as the blackouts
of the power transportation networks in North America.
In this paper, we study the eﬀects of
geographical structure on the cascading phenomena of load-carried scale-free networks, ﬁnd that
more geographically constrained networks tend to have larger cascading breakdowns. Explanations
by the eﬀects of circles and large betweenness of small degree nodes are provided.

Recently dynamical processes on networks has been
highly concerned and widely investigated [1, 2, 3].
Among many of the dynamical features of networks, ro-
bustness attracts much attention [4, 5, 6, 7], much of
which focus on scale-free (SF) networks, i.e., the degrees
λ,
of nodes satisfy a power law distribution: P (k)
for their ubiquity in real systems [8]. The heterogeneity
of the degrees often makes the scale-free networks sen-
sitive to intentional attack [6, 7], while it is resilience
to random breakdowns [5, 7], and also resilience under
avalanche phenomena by the role of the hubs that sus-
tain large amounts of grain, playing the role of reservoirs
[9]. Furthermore, for cascading failures, the load-carried
SF network is fragile even when one attacks only one
node or very few nodes with the largest degrees [10].

Since many real networks exist in two or three dimen-
sional physical spaces, it is helpful to study the geograph-
ical complex networks and it has attracted much atten-
tion recently [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. It has been shown that
geographical structure has great inﬂuence on percolation
thresholds [15]. Since many real systems bear cascading
failures, such as power grid networks, traﬃc lines, In-
ternet, etc., and also lay on the two dimensional global
surface, the inﬂuence of geographical structures on cas-
cading breakdowns is of highly importance and up to now
is rarely studied.

In this paper, we study the eﬀects of geographical
structure on the cascading phenomena of load-carried
scale-free networks, in which each node carries a cer-
tain type of load, such as power, traﬃc, etc., and if the
node is broken down, its load will be redistributed to
its neighbors. We investigate the Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld
(BTW) sandpile model [9, 16] as a prototypical model on
a weighted lattice embedded SF (WLESF) network [14];
and further study the betweenness distribution. Both
validate that the more spatially loosely connected net-
work is more robust under cascading failures, i.e., they
have less huge avalanche events. The network is gen-
erated as follows [14]. It begins with an L
L lattice,
with periodical boundary conditions, and for each node
assigned a degree k drawn from the prescribed SF degree
λ, k > m. Then a node i is picked
distribution P (k)
out randomly, according to a Gaussian weight function

, it selects other nodes and estab-
lishes connections until its degree quota ki is ﬁlled or until
it has tried many enough times, avoiding duplicate con-
nections. The process is carried out for all the nodes in
the lattice. The clustering parameter A controls the spa-
tial denseness of the connections. For large A limits, e.g.
A√m
L, the weight function will be trivial, and the
network becomes a SF random (SFR) network, i.e., ran-
dom otherwise than SF degree distribution [17]. To com-
pare, we also investigated lattice embedded SF (LESF)
networks with nearest neighbor connections [11]. Here,
we assume that the time scales governing the dynamics
are much smaller than that characterizing the network
evolvement, thus the static geographical network models
are suitable for discussing the problems.

≫

The rules we adopted for sandpile dynamics are as fol-
lows: (i) At each time step, a grain is added at a ran-
domly chosen node i.
(ii) If the height at the node i
reaches or exceeds a prescribed threshold zi = ki, the
degree of the node i, then it becomes unstable and all
the grains at the node topple to its adjacent nodes:
ki; and for each i’s neighbor j: hj = hj + 1;
hi = hi −
during the transfer, there is a small fraction f of grains
being lost, which plays the role of sinks without which
the system becomes overloaded in the end. (iii) If this
toppling causes any of the adjacent nodes to be unstable,
subsequent topplings follow on those nodes in parallel un-
til there is no unstable node left, forming an avalanche
event. (iv) Repeat (i) –(iii).

The main feature of the BTW sandpile model on Eu-
clidean space is the emergence of a power law with
an exponential cutoﬀ in the avalanche size distribution,
s/sc , where s is the avalanche size, i.e., the
p(s)
number of toppling nodes in an avalanche event, and sc is
its characteristic size. In our studies, nodes toppled more
than once in an avalanche event is seldom [9], unless for
the very large avalanches, which have already exceeded
the exponential cutoﬀs. Thus we study the avalanche
area, which is the number of distinct nodes that toppled
in an avalanche event, instead of avalanche size. The
avalanche area distribution follows the same form as that

where a is the avalanche area, and ac its characteristic

For BTW sandpile model on SFR networks, K. S. Goh
et al. [9] have shown that the avalanche area exponent τ
increases as λ decreases, caused by the increasing num-
ber of hubs playing the role of reservoirs. Here, we will
demonstrate that for the densely connected scale-free ge-
ographical networks, the reservoir eﬀect is weakened, and
the network has a smaller τ .

Figure 2 represents the avalanche area distribution
for diﬀerent λ of LESF networks and WLESF networks
It shows that as λ decreases, the curve
with A = 1.
of avalanche area distribution is steeper, corresponds to
larger τ . These are the same as the results in Ref.
[9].
The avalanche area exponent τ for these data are ﬁtted
by formula 1, and is presented in Fig. 3, together with
that of SFR networks for comparison. The data for SFR
networks we obtained is consistent with that of [9]. For
large λ large N limits, the SFR network tends to ER
random graphs, for which τ
1.5 [9, 18]; while LESF
network tends to a super lattice, with each node has m
neighbors; since in our studies m = 4, the network limits
to a normal 2D lattice, which has a value of 1.01(2) for
τ , consistent with the previous results [16, 19].

The avalanche area exponent for diﬀerent A of WLESF
network is shown in Fig. 4. As A goes larger, avalanche
area exponent τ increases, the curves of avalanche area
distribution become sharper in the double-log plot (see
inset of Fig.
4), which corresponds to fewer large
avalanche events. This transition in τ illuminates that
when the network is geographically more loosely con-
nected, it will be harder for large cascading events to
occur.

WLESF A = 1 (right panel) networks. For both panels, from
up to down λ = 10.0, 5.0, 4.0, 3.5, 3.0, 2.8, 2.6, 2.4. The
loosing probability is f = 0.001, and m = 4, N = 105. 10
network realizations are carried out and for each 106 avalanche
events are recorded for statistics.

λ. The data are ﬁtted by formula 1, from the data presented
in Fig. 2 and that of SFR networks. The network parameters
and the statistics for SFR network are the same as that in
Fig. 2.

The range of an edge is the length of the shortest paths
between the nodes it connected in the absence of itself
[2, 20]. If an edge’s range is l, it will probably belong
to an l + 1 circle. Thus the distribution of range in
a network sketches the distribution of circles. The in-
set of Fig. 5 shows that when the spatial constrains is
slighter, as A goes larger, the range distribution drifts to
larger ranges. It means that spatially loosely connected
networks have fewer small order circles but more higher
order circles. If there are many small order circles, the
toppling grains are easier to meet, and the nodes with
1, especially those
much less grains, i.e., fewer than z

threshold z and topple. Larger order circles contribute
less to this eﬀect. The main frame of Fig. 5 shows the
fraction of nodes toppled in avalanches that have pre-
1 grains. As the network is less geographically
cisely z
constrained and has fewer small order circles, the fraction
of toppling nodes with z
1 grains increases, justiﬁes our
reasoning. This eﬀect contributes to the large avalanche
events of the densely connected networks, and explains
the decrease of avalanche area exponent τ as the network
is more geographically constrained.

In the following section, we studied the betweenness
distribution of these geographical networks. The be-
tweenness, or betweenness centrality, of node i is deﬁned
as the total number of shortest paths between pairs of
nodes that pass through i [21]. If a pair of nodes has two
shortest paths, the nodes along those paths are given
a betweenness of 1/2 each. The betweenness distribu-
tion for SF networks is reported to follow a power law
δ, and for 2 < λ 6 3, the exponent is δ
2.2(1)

[9]. We ﬁnd that the betweenness distribution of LESF
network decays much slower than that of SFR networks,
as Fig. 6 demonstrates for a particular case. The distri-
butions for WLESF networks lay between them, but do
not appear in the graph for clearness. The same holds
for other λ and m values. Thus there are more large
betweenness nodes in LESF networks than in SFR net-
works. To comprehend this, we plot the betweenness vs
node’s degree in Fig. 7. For LESF networks the be-
tweenness of the same degree is distributed much more
diﬀusively, and on average are larger. It could be seen
that even nodes with small degree k could have unusually
large betweenness.

spread along geodesics, i.e., along the shortest paths be-
tween nodes. Since the betweenness of a node is the num-
ber of shortest paths passing through it, larger between-
ness means that it will have higher possibility to receive
grains in avalanching processes.
In the above sandpile
model, the toppling threshold is the node’s degree, thus
the node that has large betweenness but small degree
will be easier to topple. As Fig. 7 shows, LESF net-
work have more such nodes than SFR networks, and the
situation changes continuously for WLESF network with

In conclusion, by studying avalanching processes on ge-
ographical SF networks, we ﬁnd that besides the reservoir
eﬀects of the hubs in SF networks, geography has great
inﬂuences on the critical exponents of these systems. The
decreasing avalanche area component τ for the more geo-
graphically constrained network hints high risks for such
network to breakdown through cascading failures, since
they have a much higher possibility to experience huge
avalanche events, due to the denser connections and huge
number of smaller order circles and larger betweenness of
small degree nodes. Since many real networks that car-
ried some kinds of loads, i.e., power, traﬃc, data packets,
etc., are imbedded in the 2D global surface and highly
clustered, our results indicate that they will suﬀer more
severe risks under node failures.

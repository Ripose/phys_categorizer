One degree of freedom is suﬃcient for intra-elements. In Japan, a huge project studying soft

matter involves a budget of the order of a billion yen. This is just one aspect showing the world-

wide interest in non-equilibrium elements whose internal dynamics interacts with macroscopic or

mesoscopic order of elements1−5. The elements in this paper denote symptoms such as a bacterium

having an internal network of genes and proteins6, a reactive droplet in reaction-diﬀusion systems7,

a neuron in networks8,9, etc10−14. These elements exhibit not only spatio-temporal patterns but

also collective functions. For instance, the cohort migration of mammalian cells forms tissue

patterns15,16, and the Proteus mirabilis eﬀectively invades human urothelial cells by swarming17.

Further, swarm intelligence has been extensively studied in order to enable a collection of simple

robots to perform advanced tasks18. Here, we show a simple model derived by means of mathemat-

ical techniques to study the cross-cutting phenomenon underlying the above systems while ignoring

system-speciﬁc details. The derived model exhibits rich patterns such as a modular network and

a closed membrane that moves around, grows, and multiplies like a cell. This model is expected

to shed light on issues related to several disciplines.

In order to avoid an ad-hoc toy model, we propose a broad class of models from which

we derive a simple model by means of centre-manifold reduction and phase reduction19. At

the end of this paper, we brieﬂy discuss the vast possibilities of this derived model.

Self-sustained (or limit-cycle) oscillator is the leading candidate for the simplest dy-

namical element. Thus, we assume a supercritical Hopf bifurcation for the intra-element

dynamics. A simple interaction among the elements is mediated by a chemical that diﬀuses

in space. Thus, we assume that the elements exhibit chemotaxis20, which means that the

elements are driven by the gradient of chemical density, and the elements produce and con-

sume the chemical depending on their state. We carry out centre manifold reduction in the

neighbourhood of the Hopf bifurcation point. However, because the reduced model captures

the critical centre of systems, the model describes the systems in a broad parameter space

until another bifurcation occurs. In addition, the reduced model can be derived from an-

other class of models having the same critical centre as that in our original class of models.

Thus, the model derived in the following is fairly universal.

The reduced model of the chemotaxis oscillators is given

˙φi = 1 + (κP (ri) + c.c.),

˙ri = −∇P (r)|r=ri + c.c.,

φi represents the internal state of ith element. The D-dimensional real vector ri represents

the position of the ith element. κ is a complex constant. P represents an interaction among

the elements and is given by

P (r) ≡ X

e−ic(φj−φi)G(rj − r),

j

where c is a real parameter. Note that the model becomes a potential system when ψ is

adiabatically eliminated. In one-dimensional space, the coupling kernel G is simply expressed

as

b and ρ are complex constants. In two-dimensional space,

GD=1(r) =

e−ρ|r|.

GD=2(r) =

K0(ρ|r|),

where K0 is the modiﬁed Bessel function of the second kind with a complex argument.
In an any-dimensional space, G(r) oscillates and rapidly decreases when |r| increases, and
G(r) almost vanishes when |r| is greater than the coupling length rc ≡ 1/Reρ. Thus, the
main characteristic of G(r) - oscillating and decreasing - is qualitatively well described by
GD=1(r), which we substitute for G in an any-dimensional space for simplicity.

In fact,

we numerically conﬁrmed that the spatio-temporal patterns shown in this paper can be

observed for the original G with slight and suitable parameter changes.

We now rescale Eq. (1) and Eq. (2). Introducing a variable ψi deﬁned as ψi ≡ c{φi −
i ≡ Reρri and ∂t′ ≡

[1 + (κG(0) + c.c.)]t}, we rescale the spatio-temporal coordinate as r′

|ρ/(cκb)|∂t. Omitting the prime, we obtain

˙ψi = X

e−|Rji| sin(Ψji + α|Rji| − c1),

˙ri = c3 X

ˆRjie−|Rji| sin(Ψji + α|Rji| − c2),

j6=i

j6=i

(6)

(7)

where Rji ≡ rj − ri, ˆRji ≡ Rji/|Rji| and Ψji ≡ ψj − ψi. These equations contain the

four real parameters c1 ≡ arg(cκb/ρ) − π/2, c2 ≡ arg(−b) − π/2, c3 ≡ Reρ|ρ/cκ|(> 0) and
α ≡ Imρ/Reρ(> 0). Note that c3 is the ratio of the time scales of ψi and ri.

Hence, we derived two models: model I Eq. (1) and Eq. (2), and model II Eq. (6) and

Eq. (7). (The second model is equivalent to the ﬁrst model in one-dimensional space. In

a higher-dimensional space, the former is an approximation of the latter as stated above.)

These models are extended models reported in the previous paper21,22.

Now, we show the richness of these models by using numerical calculations carried out

in two-dimensional space with a periodic boundary condition. The boundary conditions
are not important in suﬃciently large systems because the coupling function G(r) decays
rapidly as |r| increases. The initial condition is such that the positions and phases are

randomly distributed. The number of elements is ﬁfty. The ﬁgures show snapshots of

the element distribution in two-dimensional space after the transient time. The colours

represent the phase φ (or ψ) of the element. Figure1 shows ﬁrework exhibited by the ﬁrst

model. This pattern is static in space, and the phase waves spread from the centre of the

pattern, which can correspond to the target pattern in reaction-diﬀusion systems. In fact, our

models also exhibit spiral waves with another choice of parameters. Figure2 shows the closed

membrane exhibited by the second model. This membrane moves around while maintaining

and c = 1. The space size is 120 × 120, and it is shown in entirety. Although we have adopted a

point element in this paper, we plot its position with a ﬁnite size for visualizing.

almost its shape. We can observe the fraction of the membrane where the elements are

relatively synchronised23. This fraction is puﬀs up as time passes. Thus, in this ﬁgure, the

membrane subsequently moves upwards. If we change the parameters slightly, the membrane

is divided into two synchronous clusters, which grow to form two closed membranes, and this

process repeats. When the number of elements constituting one membrane decreases due to

membrane division, the elements merge with neighbouring elements. This dynamical pattern

reminds us of the proliferation of cells .Figure3 shows clustered clusters (or modular networks)

exhibited by the second model. This self-organised hierarchical structure is constituted by

synchronous clusters that exhibit anti-phase synchronisation with the neighbouring clusters,

which reminds us of the self-diﬀerentiation of cells. Here, it should be noted that in these

three patterns, adjacent elements exhibit an approximate in-phase synchronisation. We

cannot present all the patterns in this paper; however, by simply changing the parameters,

our models can exhibit a junction of three branches, a crystalline lattice, gas, collective

translational motion parallel to plane phase-wave, stick-slip motion of clusters, train motion,

etc.

In order to understand the patterns analytically, we consider two-oscillators system; this

corresponds to the case where there is only one oscillator in the neighbourhood of the ith

c3 = 0.02 and α = 0. The space size is 10 × 10.

eters are c1 = c2 = c3 = 1.5 and α = 1.6. The space size is 30 × 30.

oscillator. This analysis sheds light on many-oscillators system too. Because ˙rik ˆRji, the
two oscillators move only along a line parallel to ˆRji that does not change with time. Thus,
we use ri ≡ ri · ˆRji instead of ri. The diﬀerence of the two oscillators Ψ ≡ ψ2 − ψ1 and

R ≡ r2 − r1 obeys

˙Ψ = −2e−R cos(αR − c1) sin Ψ,

˙R = 2c3e−R sin(αR − c2) cos Ψ,

(8)

where we assume R ≥ 0 without losing generality because we can transpose the labels of

oscillators 1 and 2. When Eq. (8) is divided by Eq. (9), we can separate variables Ψ and R;

then, integrating once, we derive the invariant curve

| sin Ψ| = Eea1R| sin(αR − c2)|a2,

(10)

where a1 ≡ sin(c1 − c2)/c3 and a2 ≡ cos(c1 − c2)/(αc3).

(We can easily derive another

curve when α = 0 or c3 = 0.) E is a conserved quantity that is deﬁned by the initial

conditions Ψ(0) and R(0). Thus, the diﬀerence of the two oscillators moves on this invariant

curve. This equation implies that if the two oscillators synchronise (in-phase Ψ = 0 or

anti-phase Ψ = π), the distance must be R = c2/α mod (π/α). In fact, this distance can be

observed in Fig.3, where the distance between the neighbouring elements in the synchronous

cluster is c2/α, and the distance between neighbouring synchronous clusters is c2/α + π/α.

Further, Eq. (10) prohibits the distance from making the right hand side of Eq. (10) become

greater than one. This implies an eﬀective excluded volume, i.e. the elements spontaneously

maintain a ﬁnite distance between each other even if they do not have an excluded volume.

Another analysis can also be carried out, and we will show this elsewhere.

At the end of this paper, we comment on the vast possibilities of our models. (1) These

models pertain to not only the systems stated in the introductory part but also the following

(a)-(f). (a) Networks, where the strength of the link (or edge) between nodes corresponds
to the distance |Rij|. In a social networking service, the update of an individual page is

as frequent as that of the relation between individual pages, i.e. the time scale of a node

is comparable to that of a link. This is rarely observed in conventional home pages. Our

models can shed light on this type of recent network types. In addition, our models suggest

new possibilities for information or memory processing in neural networks exhibiting spike

timing dependent synaptic plasticity(STDP)24 etc. (b) Fluids where an acoustic wave medi-

ates interaction among the radii of bubbles. (c) Motile-spin glass, where the state of the spin

corresponds to the phase ψ (or φ), and the wave function of the electron surrounding the

spin corresponds to the oscillatory coupling function G25. (d) Reaction-diﬀusion systems.

For instance, the phase waves on the ﬁrework in our models correspond to the target and

spiral patterns in reaction-diﬀusion systems. Further, the ﬁrework, branch, junction of the

three branches and cell division in our models can correspond to the spots, stripes, defects in

the stripes and pulse division in reaction-diﬀusion systems26. (e) Frustration systems. In our

6

model with some parameters, the elements stabilize when they are located away from each

other. This causes frustration in high-density elements systems. (f) Time-delayed systems.

τ 6= 0 implies an eﬀective delay in the interaction among elements. (2) Thermodynamical

limit, i.e. the presence of many elements, which involves non-equilibrium statistics and an

extended kinetic theory of gases27. We can derive a continuous model for the density of

elements. (3) The coulomb interaction, i.e. galvanotaxis instead of chemotaxis28. This will

shed light on ionic ﬂuids where dipoles may correspond to the elements. Further, this is

interesting because of the fact that cancer cells and, more generally, biological cells exhibit

galvanotaxis. (4) Three- or higher-dimensional spaces. We may observe self-organised spher-

ical shells. (5) Design of materials having newly identiﬁed physical properties by using the

self-organised structures of our models29,30.

There are previous studies (referred in the introductory part) sharing similar concepts

as in this paper. However, to date, we have not come across models that are as simple,

reasonable, powerful and that provide for analytical results. Such models are derived in this

paper. Our models show that only one variable (phase in this paper) other than the position

variable is suﬃcient to obtain the rich collective behaviour of systems. I believe that this

study is a seminal foundation, which I write incidentally the second Monday October 2006,

i.e. the anniversary of Columbus discovering the New World.

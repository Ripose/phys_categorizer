Abstract

We analyze the data of the Italian and U.S. futures on the stock markets and we
test the validity of the Continuous Time Random Walk assumption for the survival
probability of the returns time series via a renewal aging experiment. We also study
the survival probability of returns sign and apply a coarse graining procedure to
reveal the renewal aspects of the process underlying its dynamics.

1 Introduction

In the last few years there has been an increasing interest for the subject of
fractional derivatives and for the physical, biological, sociological and econo-
physical application of this theoretical tool. We refer the reader to the recent
mini-review of Scalas [1], who addresses this issue with a special emphasis
on the econophysical application. There is close connection between fractional
calculus and Continuous Time Random Walk (CTRW) perspective [2], and
consequently with the subject of non-Markov master equations [3]. However,
these connections, and the formal equivalence of the equations motion for the
probability time evolution as well, do not necessarily imply physical equiva-
lence. For instance, the generalized diﬀusion equation discussed in Refs. [4,5],

in the super-diﬀusional case is incompatible with the CTRW perspective, in-
sofar as there are no renewal events, resetting to zero the system’s memory.

In the case of ﬁnancial market, there have been recently several contributions,
related to some diﬀerent extents, to the subject of fractional derivatives and
CTRW [6,8,9,10,11,12,7]. Of special interest for this paper is the fact that the
authors of Ref. [6] using fractional calculus made the theoretical prediction
that the high-frequency ﬁnancial market data generate a Survival Probability
(SP) with the form of a Mittag-Leﬄer function. The later paper of Ref. [8], an
empirical analysis, conﬁrmed the theoretical prediction of Ref. [6], even though
the restriction to short times forced the authors of Ref. [8] to approximate the
Mittag-Leﬄer SP with a stretched exponential.

In this paper we show how to go beyond this limit, so as to reveal the Mittag-
Leﬄer SP in its entirety. To realize this purpose, we study the SP for two
diﬀerent ﬁnancial markets, the futures on the Italian stock index, S&P MIB,
and the futures on the US S&P500. We discuss the emergence of a Mittag-
Leﬄer SP from the returns time series at our disposal. However, in principle,
the mere analysis of the form of the SP is not yet enough to ensure that
the dynamics of ﬁnancial market are compatible with the CTRW perspective.
This is so because, as earlier pointed out, the formal equivalence between
two generalized master equations, one of Liouville origin [13] and the other of
CTRW origin, does not ensure the full dynamic equivalence (see also [5]).

In the last few years it became clear that CTRW yields renewal aging [14],
and the authors of Refs. [15,16] have proposed numerical experiments to assess
this important property in physical systems. We plan to use the prescription of
Ref. [16] as an eﬃcient method to establish the renewal nature of the ﬁnancial
market process. Proving renewal aging is equivalent to ruling out the possi-
bility that the generalized master equation generating the Mittag-Leﬄer SP
might have a Liouville origin, with trajectory memory and no renewal event.
It has to pointed out, however, that the aging experiment must be done with
caution. In fact, as shown in Ref. [16], the renewal event might be masked
by a cloud of secondary events, of Poisson nature, generating the wrong im-
pression that the process is not renewal, and that its memory is a property of
the individual trajectories. The authors of Ref. [17] denoted these producing
camouﬂage events as pseudo events, and have established that in the case of
heart beating analysis they are generated by the data processing procedure
itself used for the statistical analysis. In other cases, the pseudo events can be
triggered by the renewal events: for instance, the authors of Ref. [18], studied
the seismic ﬂuctuations in South California and made the conjecture that the
main shocks are renewal events, triggering the Omori after shocks, which are
an example of pseudo events in this case. The main shocks are not necessarily
the seismic ﬂuctuations of large intensity, and the seismic ﬂuctuation caused
by them might be larger, thereby making the renewal events invisible.

2

How to detect the renewal events? This is a challenging issue that has been
mainly addressed so far through the scaling analysis. There are reasons to
believe that when the time series is converted into a diﬀusion process, after
a long-time transition, the critical events reveal their presence through the
anomalous asymptotic scaling. This condition, of course, requires that the
critical renewal events do not obey Poisson statistics. On the other hand, if
the ratio of the number of critical to pseudo events is small, the transition to
the anomalous scaling regime might be so slow as to occur outside the range
of the numerical analysis of real data [19].

In this paper we ﬁnd that the procedure adopted in Ref. [16] has also the
surprising eﬀect of disclosing the hidden power-law tail of the Mittag-Leﬄer
function predicted by the theory of Refs. [6,7,8]. We propose also a coarse-
graining procedure that has the eﬀect of erasing many pseudo events so to
make the resulting process almost completely renewal.

2 Aging of a non Poisson renewal process

To illustrate the basic concepts underlying the method used in this paper,
consider the paradigmatic case of a particle moving with the following equation
of motion:

˙y = αyz,
(1)
with y ∈ [0, 1], z > 1 and 0 < α ≪ 1. When the particle reaches y = 1 it is
back injected uniformly between 0 and 1 to a totally random initial position.
Thus we deﬁne as event the arrival of the particle at the border y = 1, and
we prove with a straightforward algebra that the time distance between two
consecutive events yields a waiting time distribution ψ(τ ) with the following
form:

ψ(τ ) = (µ − 1)

T µ−1
(T + τ )µ ,

where τ is the time it takes for the particle to reach the border, moving from
the initial random position, and:

µ =

z
z − 1

,

T =

µ − 1
α

.

This is therefore a simple prescription to create a non-Poisson renewal process.
It is also evident that, when z → 1, µ → ∞, thereby making the waiting time
distribution become an exponential function.

Let us use the dynamic model of Eq. (1) to illustrate the concept of renewal
aging. For this purpose, let us imagine that the ﬁrst back injection occurs at

(2)

(3)

3

time t = 0, the time origin. We deﬁne this condition as system preparation
at time t = 0. We deﬁne Eq. (2) as the brand new waiting time distribution,
insofar as it is produced by preparing and observing the system at the same
time t = 0. Eq. (2) predicts the time we have to wait to observe the next back
injection. If observation begins at time t′ > 0, and many back injections might
have possibly occurred at earlier times, we obtain the waiting time distribution
ψ(τ, t′). This waiting time distribution predicts the probability of the ﬁrst back
injection, with the system prepared at t = 0, and observation beginning at
time t′ > 0. The function ψ(τ, t′) of Poisson systems is independent of t′, and
in the non-Poisson case it turns out to depend on t′. An exact formula for
ψ(τ, t′) exists [21], but it is not a simple analytical expression. In this paper
we shall use instead the following approximated expression:

where K is a suitable normalization constant. The validity of Eq. (4) has been
already tested for several values of µ (see, for instance [16] for an application
on blinking quantum dots) proving itself to be very reliable. In the following
Sections, instead of the waiting time distribution ψ(t, t′), we shall use the SP.
The SP is deﬁned as follows:

ψ(τ, t′) = R

t′
0 dyψ(τ + y)
K

,

Ψ(τ ) =

ψ(y)dy.

∞

Z

t

(4)

(5)

It represents the probability that no events occurred between 0 and t. The SP
corresponding to Eq. (4) will be denoted by means of the symbol Ψt′(τ ).

It is worthwhile spending some more words on the property of renewal aging,
on which the main tenet of this paper rests. Renewal aging is a property
of non-Poisson renewal systems that emerges at the level of ensemble. If we
consider an ensemble of trajectories, all of them being diﬀerent realizations of
the same experiment, and therefore all of them being statistically equivalent,
the distribution of the ﬁrst back injection times shows renewal aging, that is,
a marked dependence on the time at which observation begins. This does not
conﬂict with the fact that at the level of the single trajectories every event
resets to zero the system’s memory, thereby producing a condition where every
event is completely uncorrelated with the previous ones.

3 Illustration of the data under study and empirical analysis of the

survival probability

The data set avaliable to us consists of all the transactions extracted from the
futures on the Italian stock index 2 , ranging from January 2000 to Decem-
ber 2002, and all the transactions extracted from the futures US stock index,
S&P500, ranging from January 1993 to January 2001. We have all the trans-
actions but we use only the next-to-expiration ones, with the markets expiring
quarterly. A futures is a standardized contract that rules the exchange of a
good at a given time, called maturity. The futures belongs to a larger category
of contracts, called derivatives, that move nowadays almost 90% of the total
amount of money on a market and for this reason they have become one of
the main investigating ﬁelds.

In the ﬁnancial markets the price movements are recorded. Thanks to the
introduction of computers, it has become possible to increase the frequency
of registration and therefore explore what is called high-frequency regime. In
this paper we focus our attention on this regime. In ﬁnance it is common to
use, instead of the price movement, the return, deﬁned as the diﬀerence of two
consecutive logarithmic prices.

Let us study the distribution of waiting times of the two data sets avaliable to
us. In a recent paper, Mainardi et. al [7] studied the tick-by-tick dynamics of
the BUND futures traded at LIFFE. The outcome of their analysis conﬁrmed
the statement of a previous paper by Scalas et al. [6] in which the authors
argued the SP to be a Mittag-Leﬄer function. The Mittag-Leﬄer function
is an important entire transcendental function [20], successfully adopted in
econophysics [6]. It can expressed as a power series in the complex plane:

Eβ(z) =

∞

Xn=0

zn
Γ(βn + 1)

,

β > 0, z ∈ C,

(6)

where β is the order of the function. The interested reader can consult, among
the others, Refs. [6,7,20] for a complete treatment of the properties of the
Mittag-Leﬄer function. In a later paper Raberto et al. [8] analyzed the sta-
tistical properties the SP of General Electric stock returns and found that it
was compatible with a stretched exponential, which it is known to represent
the limit of a Mittag-Leﬄer function of argument (−γt) and order β for t → 0
when 0 < β < 1.

We approach the problem of the statistical analysis of our data set keeping in

replaced by the S&P MIB Futures, because the stock index MIB30 has been replaced
by the S&P MIB.

mind the interesting results of these authors [6,7]. In the spirit of these papers,
we build the SP for the tick-by-tick dynamics of the returns, and we obtain
the results of Figs. 1 and 2.

Fig. 2. In this ﬁgure we show the SP of tick-by-tick returns for the US futures on
the stock index S&P500. The ﬁtting function is compatible with an inverse power
law function with index β = 2.3.

In the case of the Italian futures the best ﬁtting function is a stretched expo-
nential exp{−(γτ )β/Γ(1+β)}, with β = 0.49 and γ = 0.4. This result is in line
with Ref. [8], where a similar behavior was found for the SP, thereby implying
the absence of the inverse power law tail for the Mittag-Leﬄer function. In
the case of the US futures, Fig. 2, we observe instead an inverse power law
function for the SP of returns. The index is β = 2.3. In this case we would
be tempted to rule out the theory of the authors of Refs. [6,7,8]. In either
cases, however, there are no compelling arguments to prove the CTRW origin
of these SP, although in the former case the result is so close to the theory of

6

Refs. [6,7,8] as to make it natural to consider it to be a renewal process. In
the next Section we shall illustrate an aging experiment which will help us to
make progresses towards the important goal of proving the renewal nature of
these economic processes.

4 Aging of the survival probability

As earlier mentioned, we devote this section to examining our data by means
of a procedure applied in a previous article [16]. This technique turns the
SP of the original time series, Ψ(τ ), into two SP’s, denoted as Ψexp
t′ (τ ) and
Ψren
t′ (τ ). The former is derived from the original time series by means of an
aging numerical experiment that we describe hereby. The latter is derived from
the ψ(τ ) of the original time series, as follows. First we turn the experimental
ψ(τ ) into ψ(τ, t′) by means of Eq. (4), then we derive from this aged waiting
time distribution the corresponding SP, thereby producing Ψren
t′ (τ ). In the
ideal case of a renewal system we would obtain Ψren
t′ (τ ). According
to Ref. [16], the existence of pseudo events would reduce the aging eﬀect till to
its total annihilation when the number of pseudo events becomes very large.

The formula of Eq. (4) is based on probabilistic arguments, and consequently,
on the ideal use of a Gibbs ensemble of sequences. We have only one sequence,
and we have to turn it into a set of Gibbs sequences, prepared in the same
way at time t = 0 and observed at a later time t′ > 0. This is done as follows.
The ﬁrst sequence of the Gibbs ensemble is: τ 1
4 . . ., the superscript
indicating the sequence and the subscript the chronological order of waiting
times; the second sequence is obtained from the ﬁrst by erasing the ﬁrst waiting
time, thereby yielding τ 2
3 . . .; the third sequence is obtained from
the second again erasing the ﬁrst waiting time, thus yielding τ 3
2 = τ 1
3 ,
τ 3
2 = τ 2
4 , and so on. All these sequences are examined in the absolute
time representation, where time is denoted by the symbol t and the time of an
event occurrence is denoted by the symbol tj
i , with the superscript j indicating
the system of the ensemble built up with the procedure earlier described. Note
that tj
1 + . . . + τ j
i . All the systems of this ensemble
have been prepared in the same way, with a back injection occurring at time
t = 0. At this stage we ﬁx the observation time t′, and for the j-th system of the
i > t′
ensemble we monitor the ﬁrst event occurring after this time, at time tj
i − t′. This allows us to deﬁne
i (t′) = tj
and the corresponding time distance τ j
the experimental waiting time distribution ψexp
t′ (τ ). In the
case where there is no aging, we should obtain Ψexp
t′=0(τ ) = Ψ(τ ).
The ideal renewal condition should yield Ψexp

t′ (τ ) and from it Ψexp

t′ (τ ) = Ψexp
t′ (τ ).

second part. Fig. 4 reports the same experiment for the US stock futures
index, with t′ = 1000. In this case, Ψexp
in the whole
observed time regime. A weak form of aging is found, but there are no time
regions where it correspond to the renewal theory prediction. We believe that
the reduced aging is due to microstructure, inducing correlations in the high-
frequency returns, see [22,23,8]. It is well known that, for instance, bid-ask
spread causes spurious serial correlations in the time series of returns, with
extinction time of the order of some minutes. The aging experiment is sensitive
to time correlated events (pseudo events), time correlation being a property
conﬂicting with the renewal assumption of the process, thereby explaining the
results of Fig. 4.
It is also worth noticing the emergence of a distinct power law tail in the last
part of Fig. 3. This could be a sign of a hidden Mittag-Leﬄer-type function as
SP, whose presence could be revealed by means of a renewal aging experiment.

In conclusion, our analysis proves that the CTRW is a reliable model for the
Italian futures index, while in the US futures index the renewal properties are
weakened by signiﬁcant serial correlations in the return time series.

same sign. Thus, the waiting time τ is now determined by the time distance
between two consecutive changes of sign. We evaluate the SP of this sequence
and study its renewal properties via the renewal aging analysis. Also in this
case, we expect to ﬁnd reduced aging eﬀects, due to the presence of negative
serial correlations in the time series of returns, with extinction times of the
order of some minutes [22]. Figs. 5 and 6 show the results of our analysis.

on the SP of the Italian futures index returns sign persistence. t′ = 1000. We can see
in this case the presence of aging eﬀects, reduced in the ﬁrst part, while compatible
with the renewal assumption in the ﬁnal part of the plot.

As we can see in Fig. 5, in the case of the Italian market, again aging eﬀects
are present. As in the case of the tick-by-tick SP, the aging is reduced and we
can safely impute this behavior to the presence of negative serial correlation

9

in the time series of returns. However, in the ﬁnal part of the plot, we have a
good agreement with the renewal assumption for the dynamics of the market.
Regarding the US futures index, Fig. 6 shows the result in this case. We can
see that in this case the aging is almost totally suppressed. Again we explain
this eﬀect invoking the presence of strong correlations in the time series of
returns.

It is important to notice that in the special case where the change of sign of
the ﬂuctuation driving the walker’s motion is as random as a fair coin tossing,
the new waiting time distribution has the same power as the original [24].
We see that Figs. 5 and 6 illustrate a situation that it is qualitatively similar
to that of Figs. 3 and Figs. 4, respectively. This suggests that the change of
sign is a random process, or a process with a modest correlation that might
be responsible for the signiﬁcantly reduced aging eﬀect of the Italian market,
which is, in fact, even weaker than in the case of Fig. 4.

case the almost total absence of aging eﬀects.

6 Coarse graining procedure

We have earlier mentioned that the memory generated by microstructures may
hide the renewal nature of the process, which we believe to be the genuine
property of the trading action. In the economic literature a coarse graining
procedure is usually applied to raw data to get rid of these memory proper-
ties. Following Ref. [22,23] we apply the following tick coarse graining. Let us
denote by [0, T ] the time window under study, with T = 1 trading day, that is,
495 minutes, we construct a grid of T /∆t+1 points, with ∆t denoting the grid
spacing. At every point in time, we deﬁne the event (price) as the event (price)
of the last transaction before that point. Diﬀerent choices, like linear inter-
polation, are known to introduce spurious autocorrelation, see, for instance,

10

Ref. [25]. However, selecting the length ∆t of the intervals is conditioned by
the following tradeoﬀ. If the interval is too narrow, microstructure eﬀects, such
as the bid-ask bounce, remain, which would induce a spurious negative serial
correlation. On the other hand, if the interval is too large, there is a loss in
the total number of data. In order to assess the proper length of the interval
we study the daily variance of the distribution; if the dynamics of the process
is a stochastic diﬀerential equation with no drift, then the integrated variance
on the time window T must coincide with its expected value for every value
of the grid spacing ∆t, see, for instance, Ref. [26].

These important issues are illustrated by Fig. 7, which shows the integrated
variance of the Italian futures index versus the length of the interval. In accor-
dance with the earlier remarks, we see that, when the spacing is too narrow,
the variance increases. This fact is well known and can be imputed to the pres-
ence of microstructure eﬀects [27]. We decide to use an interval spacing of 60
seconds for the Italian futures, and 240 seconds for the US futures, where we
assume the integrated daily variance to be constant. Indeed, the percentage of
empty intervals in the two case has been estimated, respectively, to be below
1% and below 3%.

Fig. 7. In this Figure we show the integrated variance of the distribution of returns
for the Italian futures stock index S&P FIB as a function of the grid spacing ∆t.

We are now properly equipped to establish if the nature of the process is
compatible with the renewal assumption. The discussion of the results emerg-
ing from the application of this procedure will be the argument of the next
Section.

7 Pseudo events, critical events and renewal aging

The adoption of the coarse graining procedure described in the previous section
should make it possible to conﬁrm our conviction that the weakening of the
aging eﬀects depends on pseudo events. As already stated above, the presence
of microstructure eﬀects implies high-frequency spurious correlation eﬀects in
the time series of returns, that is, the real event is “ﬂoating” in a sea of pseudo
events. We argue that, if we were able to distinguish the real event from the
pseudo events, and create the waiting time distribution of the real events, the
resulting distribution, if markedly non exponential, should obey the condition
of renewal aging. The coarse graining has the eﬀect of reducing the number of
pseudo events, thereby disclosing the true nature of the ﬁnancial market.

t′

Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 show the results of the aging experiment on the Italian fu-
tures index and on the US futures index, respectively. We see that in both
cases the aging eﬀect is very close to the predictions of the renewal theory. It
is worth noticing that according to Fig. 8, the aging experiment in the long
time region makes, again, an inverse power law tail emerge for both Ψexp
and
Ψren
. The shape of the function becomes a Mittag-Leﬄer type with β = 0.95
t′
and γ = 0.5. This behavior remains unchanged for larger values of t′, therefore
suggesting that the aging experiment reveals the genuine nature of the pro-
cess, this being represented by the Mittag-Leﬄer SP found by the authors of
Ref. [7]. We think that this may become an eﬃcient way to assess the hidden
renewal nature of the experimental time series and we plan to devote further
study to this issue in a later publication.
The fact that the aging eﬀect in the US market is weaker than in the Ital-
ian market is not due to the non-renewal nature of the US market, but it
seems to depend on the fact that the Mittag-Leﬄer form of the SP is lack-
ing in this case. We cannot rule out the possibility that also the US market
obeys the theory of Ref. [6]. In fact, our results suggest that in this case the
stretched-exponential regime of the US market is more extended than that of
the Italian market. We note that in the short-time regime of Fig. 8, namely,
in the stretched-exponential time region, aging is virtually absent, in spite of
the renewal character of this process. Thus, the reduced aging cannot be used
as a sign of departure from the renewal condition. We think that the more
signiﬁcant aging eﬀect in the large time regime of Fig. 9 is a sign that also
in this case the inverse power law of the Mittag-Leﬄer function is made to
emerge by the aging experiment.

8 Concluding remarks

This paper conﬁrms the theory proposed by the authors of Refs. [6,7,8] to
describe the ﬁnancial market dynamics, with a careful scrutiny of the economic
data. The Mittag-Leﬄer SP, which is the main prediction of this theory, does
not emerge in its entirety from the data analyzed in this paper. The statistical
inaccuracy of the long-time region obscures the emergence of the inverse power
law tail in the US ﬁnancial market, and the Italian ﬁnancial market as well.

The aging experiment has the surprising eﬀect of making the inverse power
law distinctly appear in the long-time regime of the Italian market. The eﬀect
is not so evident in the case of the US market, and we think that this is due
to fact that the stretched-exponential regime is much more extended than in
the case of the Italian market. It is remarkable that the genuinely renewal
nature of the trading action is made visible, through the aging experiment,
by a proper coarse graining data processing. Our analysis suggests also that
the price persistence is not a process with long-range memory, and within the
limits of the numerical accuracy, the price change is virtually indistinguishable
from the adoption of a fair coin tossing to decide if price has to increase or to
decrease.

We hope that the results of this paper may give an important contribution to
the foundation of accurate ﬁnancial models. Furthermore, we are convinced
that the procedure illustrated in this article is a signiﬁcant contribution to the
detection of invisible renewal events, the challenge emerging from the results
of Ref. [17].

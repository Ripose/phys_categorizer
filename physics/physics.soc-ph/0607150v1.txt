In complex networks a common task is to identify the most important or “central” nodes. There
are several deﬁnitions, often called centrality measures, which often lead to diﬀerent results. Here
we study extensively correlations between four local and global measures namely the degree, the
shortest-path-betweenness, the random-walk betweenness and the subgraph centrality on diﬀerent
random-network models like Erd˝os-R´enyi, Small-World and Barab´asi-Albert as well as on diﬀerent
real networks like metabolic pathways, social collaborations and computer networks. Correlations
are quite diﬀerent between the real networks and the model networks questioning whether the models
really reﬂect all important properties of the real world.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Theories for complex networks have attracted much
attention in the last few years. Started by the social
sciences [1] the research incorporates disciplines ranging
from the social sciences over biology to physics. There
are studies for example on analytical properties of certain
network models, on attack vulnerability of real networks
[2] or in the prediction of epidemics [3], just to name a
few. Extensive reviews are given in Refs. 4, 5.

The main focus has been on the so-called scale-free
networks that have a degree distribution P (k) (the prob-
ability for a node to have k edges to other nodes) obey-
ing a power-law. The exponent γ of these power-laws
P (k) ∝ k−γ is typically close to 3 for many real networks.
There have been some attempts to explain this behav-
ior based on the seminal work of Barab´asi and Albert
[6, 7] who explain the scaling behavior by a preferential
attachment mechanism during network growth. These
models are based on the notion that the “importance”
(often called centrality) of a node in some cases is given
by the number of connections of a node. Nevertheless,
it seems clear not all properties of a complex real-world
system can be explained by models based on this inge-
nious yet simple mechanism. Since the degree is a very
local measure on a network it is not necessarily the best
choice to characterize all types of networks. Over the
years a few other measures [8, 9, 10] for the importance
of nodes have been proposed that actually measure global
properties of the whole structure. In these publications,
examples are shown where some nodes in a network have
a small degree, yet they play an important role for the
network. Hence, these more globale measures may de-
serve more attention. Nevertheless, we are not aware
of a thorough comparison of these measures on diﬀer-
ent model and real-world networks. Due to the relatively
small number of studies on these more complex measures,
it is so far unclear wether they are indeed better suited
to identify important nodes in networks.

For a given network, the diﬀerent measures may be
strongly correlated, i.e. a node, which has a high impor-
tance found when measuring using one measure, appears
also important when using another measure, and vice-

versa. If this was generally true for all networks, then it
would be suﬃcient to study just one measure. E.g., if all
measures were strictly monotonic and simple functions of
the degree, then the degree would be indeed the key quan-
tity to study. If, on the other hand, diﬀerent measures
are not strictly correlated, then nodes, which yield a high
importance even for diﬀerent measures, can be regarded
indeed as key nodes for a given network. Also it might
be that there are nodes which obtain a high value for
one measure, but not for another measure. In this case
either one measure is not suitable for the description of a
given network, or, if this is not systematically true, these
nodes have to be studied more closely, to understand a
network’s behavior. In any case, it appears that studying
the correlations of diﬀerent local and global properties of
nodes is a promising way to understand networks much
better than just to look at the distributions of single,
maybe even solely local properties. For this paper, we
have systematically studied several local and global net-
work measures for diﬀerent types of network models and
for a couple of networks describing real-world data. As in
some previous studies, we ﬁnd that the distributions of
single measures show in most cases the well-known scale-
free behavior, if the network shows scale-free behavior in
the degree-distribution. Nevertheless, the standard net-
work models are not capable to reproduce in many cases
the complicated correlation signatures we ﬁnd here in the
real-world data. Hence, we propose that the systematic
study of these correlations as a much better tool to study
networks and a comparison of these correlations should
be a suitable criterion to evaluate the validity of network
models.

This paper is organized as follows: In section II we
introduce the centrality measures we have used in our
studies. Section III gives an overview of the random net-
works we have considered. In section IV we present the
real networks that we have studied and how they have
been constructed. In section V we show our results and
in section VI we give an outlook to possible future direc-
tions of research.

II. CENTRALITY MEASURES

In mathematical language a network (also often called
graph) is a pair G = (V, E) consisting of a discrete set of
nodes (also called vertices) V and a discrete set of edges
E ⊂ V × V . We are only interested in undirected net-
works and therefore an edge e = {i, j} is a 2-set of nodes
containing the two nodes i, j connected by the edge. A
component of a network is a subset of nodes with the
following properties: Each node is reachable from each
other node via some path (i.e. a directly connected se-
quence) of edges and it is impossible to add another node
from V without breaking the ﬁrst requirement. In that
sense it is a maximal subset. A network may consist of
more than one component but we are mainly interested
in those networks that consist of one component. Net-
works with more that one component can be decomposed
into a set of smaller one-component networks. In the fol-
lowing n = |V | denotes the number of nodes and m = |E|
denotes the number of edges. We assume that there is
an arbitrary but ﬁxed order on the set of nodes so you
can enumerate them. Each node has therefore a natural
index.

The most prominent centrality measure of a network
is the so called degree, which is the number of edges in-
cident to a node, i.e. it’s number of neighbors.
It can
be calculated in O(1) if an appropriate network repre-
sentation is used. The degree has been used very of-
ten to describe the importance of a node. For example
for computer networks, where the computers are repre-
sented by nodes and the physical network connections
by links, routers and servers, which play a central role in
these systems, are connected to many other computers.
Hence, networks are often characterized by their degree-
distribution. The class of scale-free networks, that is net-
works with a power-law distribution, has been in the fo-
cus of interest because many real-world networks reveal
a scale-free degree distribution.

On the other hand, the degree is just a local measure
of the centrality of a node. For example in a motor-way
network, where the nodes represent junctions and the
edges represent routes, there can be very important junc-
tions, which only connect few routes, but a breakdown of
one of these junctions leads to a major traﬃc congestion.
Hence, other measures have been introduced, which are
intended to reﬂect to global importance of the nodes for
a network.

A measure of centrality that takes advantage of the
global structure of a network is the shortest-path between-
ness or simply betweenness of a node i, which is deﬁned
as the fraction of shortest paths between all possible pairs
of nodes of the network that pass through node i. Let
g(st)
be the number of shortest-paths between node s and
i
t running through node i and n(st) the total number of
shortest-paths between s and t. Then the betweenness bi
for node i is given by

value of the betweenness is between zero and one. This
measure has been introduced in social sciences (see [8]
and [11]) quite a while ago. The algorithm we use to
calculate the betweenness is presented in Ref. 12 and has
a time-complexity of O(mn). That means this algorithm
can handle rather large networks really eﬃciently.

P

The logical background of the betweenness is that the
ﬂow of information, goods, etc., depending on the type
of network, can be in some way directed in a determinis-
tic way. In particular the full network structure must be
known for each decision. Nevertheless, e.g. if all people
decide to take the same single shortest route to the center
of a city, this might result in a large value of the over-
all travelling times. Also, there may be networks, e.g.
social networks, the nodes representing persons and the
edges representing personal relations, where the informa-
tion ﬂow is not controlled externally or deterministically
and the full network structure is not known to all players.
A recent proposal for the so called random-walk between-
ness (RDW betweenness) by Newman [9] models the fact
that individual nodes do not “know” the whole structure
of the network and therefore a global optimum assump-
tion is not very convincing. Within this approach, ran-
dom walks through the network are used as a basis for
calculating the centrality for each node: The random-
walk betweenness of a node j is the fraction of random
walks between node s and node t passing through j av-
eraged over all possible pairs of source node s and target
node t. Loops within the random walks are excluded by
using probability-ﬂows for calculating the actual RDW
betweenness. After a simple calculation [9] one arrives at
an algorithm, which looks like as follows:

1. Construct the adjacency matrix A and the degree

matrix D

2. Calculate the matrix D - A

3. Remove the last row and column, so the matrix
becomes invertible (any equation is redundant to
the remaining ones)

4. Invert the matrix, add a row and a column consist-

ing of zeros and call the resulting matrix T

Note that so far the calculated quantities do not de-
pend on i or s, t. Now the random-walk betweenness bi

for node i can be calculated by

to s or t. Note that although the RDW betweenness
is based on a random quantity, its calculation is not at
all random. Hence, any scatter observed in the data is
due to the networks structure not due to ﬂuctuations of
the measurement.
It is possible to implement the cal-
culation of the RDW betweenness with time-complexity
O((m + n)n2). The drawback is the considerable amount
of computer memory needed since this algorithm uses
a adjacency matrix and other matrices of the same di-
mension. Hence the memory consumption has the order
O(n2). Sparse-matrix methods could make the situation
better since most networks have sparse adjacency matri-
ces but that would worsen the time-complexity which is
not desirable.

The fourth measure we use within this study is the sub-
graph centrality [10] (SC ), which is based on the idea that
the importance of a node should depend on its partici-
pation in local closed walks where the contribution gets
the smaller the longer the closed walk is. The number of
closed walks of length k starting and ending on node i in
the network is given by the local spectral moments µk(i)
of the networks adjacency matrix A which are deﬁned as

The deﬁnition of the SC for node i is then given by

µk(i) = (Ak)ii

CS(i) =

∞

µk(i)
k!

Albeit it is possible to directly calculate the series directly
it would not be overly eﬃcient to do so.
It is shown
in [10] that it is possible to alternatively calculate the
adjacency matrix’s eigenvalues λi and an orthonormal
base of eigenvectors vi for a network. Then the subgraph
centrality Cs for node i can then be calculated via

CS(i) =

[(vj )i]2eλj .

n

j=0
X

This measure generally generates values with high order
of magnitude and is not in some way limited. We tried to
normalize with Cs(1) of a fully connected graph with the
same number of vertices (all vertices are equal so every
vertex has the same subgraph centrality), but this gave us
values beyond machine precision for graphs larger than
5000 vertices, i.e. even much larger than the values we
observed for the networks under consideration. Hence,
we used the non-normalized values.

3

We compared the diﬀerent measures on diﬀerent
random-network models, namely the Erd˝os-R´enyi (ER)
model [13, 14, 15], the Small-World (SW) model [16, 17,
18] and the Barab´asi-Albert (BA) model [6, 7]. The ER
model consists of random networks of a ﬁxed number of
nodes n and for each pair of nodes an edge is added with
probability p. The degree distribution of this model is
Poissonian.

The SW model is also characterized by a ﬁxed number
of nodes n, but here the nodes a placed on a regular grid.
An instance is generated in two steps. First, each node
is connected to its k nearest neighbors.
In the second
step, each edge is reconnected to one random node with
probability p (i.e. the other node remains). Most SW net-
works studied are based on a one-dimensional grid with
periodic boundary conditions, i.e. the nodes are ordered
on a circle. The degree distributions of these networks
interpolates between a delta peak at k for p = 0 and the
Poissonian distribution for p → 1.

The BA model is the only growth model studied here.
In this case the networks are created by a so called pref-
erential attachment mechanism. Each generated random
network starts with m nodes and new nodes are added
consecutively, one after the other. A new node is imme-
diately connected to exactly m of the already existing
nodes, which are chosen randomly. The higher the de-
gree k of an existing node the bigger is the chance that it
is selected as neighbor. Hence, the probability for a node
i to get selected is given by its degree ki divided by the
j kj of all degrees of all currently existing nodes
sum
of the network. To eﬃciently generate these networks we
used a list, where each node i is contained ki-times. For
each newly added node we select m diﬀerent elements
randomly from the list and connected them to the new
node. The resulting degree distribution follows a power-
law with exponent γ = 3 [24] in the limit of large degrees
(in the tail of the distribution).

P

It is also possible to get diﬀerent exponents in the tail
by adding a certain oﬀset k0 to the probability of selecting
a certain vertex, so the total probability goes as k + k0.
This yields an exponent of γ = 3 + k0/m [5] in the tail
of the distribution. k0 may be explicitly negative as long
as it is −m < k0 < ∞.

For all random-networks we prohibited parallel edges
between two nodes and self-loops, i.e. for the BA model,
each node i can be selected from the list only once. Ad-
ditionally we extracted the largest component for the ER
networks and the SW networks. Note that the BA model
generates fully connected networks.

IV. REAL NETWORKS

It is well known that the models presented in the last
section are able to reproduce some of the characteristics
of real-world networks. The most realistic models for

many applications are the BA model and related mod-
els based on growth mechanisms, which reproduce the
power-law behavior of the distributions of the degree and
some other centrality measures [4, 5]. As indicated above,
we propose in this paper to go beyond measuring dis-
tributions of local or global properties, by considering
correlations between diﬀerent measures. Hence, to inves-
tigate whether these most common models are also able
to reproduce these complex characteristics of real-world
networks, we have to compare with the results of at least
some real-world networks.

We took data from publically available databases, as
given below. In all cases, we treated the network as undi-
rected, unweighted network. This in some cases not a
good model but to examine all the networks in exactly
the same way, we have chosen to do so. In all cases, where
the networks consisted of more than one component, we
only used the largest component of the network, since
especially the random-walk betweenness is not deﬁned
properly on a network having more than one component.
Additionally we eliminated all self-loops (edges connect-
ing the same node) and parallel edges in the real-world
networks, if present.

We have studied the following ﬁve networks.

• Protein-protein interaction in Yeast (PIN)
The data was obtained from the COSIN database
[19].
In the PIN network each node represents a
certain protein and an edge is placed between them
if there has been an observation of an interaction
between the two proteins in one of various experi-
ments.

• Metabolic pathways [20] of the E. Coli bacte-
ria (ECOLI) The ECOLI network was obtained
by using the API of the KEGG [21] database plus
using the ﬁle ”‘reaction.lst”’ from the KEGG LIG-
AND database. The latter is needed to separate
the educts and the products of a reaction, since the
API only outputs which compounds are involved
in the reaction. All compounds that are catalyzed
in any way by enzymes of the E. Coli are used as
nodes and an edge is placed between two nodes if
there exists a reaction which has one compound on
one side of the reaction and the other compound
on the other side.

• Collaboration network of people working in
computational geometry (GEOM)
In the
GEOM network obtained from Ref. 22, each node
represents an author from the Computational Ge-
ometry Database with an edge between two authors
if they wrote an article together.

• Network of autonomous systems (AS) The
AS network is a computer network extracted via
trace routes from the Internet containing routers as
nodes and real-world connections between them as
edges (in fact virtual connections since the router’s
known hosts table determines which nodes can be

4

reached from a given point in the network). The
data for AS was obtained also from the COSIN
database [19].

• Network of

actors

collaboration (AC-

TORS)

The data was obtained from the Internet Movie
Data Base [27]. Nodes represent actors. Since the
database is very huge, we restricted our study to
ﬁlms from the UK after 2002. Nodes are connected
by an edge, if the corresponding actors appear in
the same ﬁlm.

Unfortunately, the ACTORS network did not yield
meaningful results because the underlying data was
quite “noisy”: In movies with a lot of actors listed
in the data base, even the less important parts get
a high connectivity. Thus, we observed for all mea-
sures given above a large scatter of the data points
and very small correlations between them. Fur-
thermore, we doubt that deﬁning a network of ac-
tors in this way is meaningful, because usually it is
not the actors who decide with whom they interact
in a ﬁlm, but the producers who select the actors.
Therefore we do not show here any plots for this
network type.

Note that all networks created in this way are of size
less than 10.000 nodes, which allows to compute the mea-
sures deﬁned in Sec. II easily.

V. RESULTS

For all random models we have used a graph size of
n = 2000 nodes and drew 100 representatives from the
ensemble of possible networks. After calculating the four
diﬀerent measures for each network, we averaged over
all representatives to get smooth distributions for each
measure and network-type. For the real networks we just
calculated all measures for each given network, clearly no
average can be performed here.

Since we consider four types of measures we can calcu-
late 6 types of measure1-measure2 correlation plots for
each graph model and each real-world graph. Since we
have studied the three diﬀerent graph ensembles for sev-
eral values of the parameters, e.g. for the edge probabil-
ity p, this is totalling in several hundred possible plots.
Many of these plots show strong correlations between the
two quantities considered and give no qualitative infor-
mation beyond that. Hence, we restrict ourselves here to
the most interesting cases, which keeps also the length of
the paper reasonable.

All Erd˝os-R´enyi networks, where we performed the
analysis always for the largest component, show high al-
most linear correlations between any two measures (not
shown) for all probabilities p ∈ 0.05, 0.10, 0.15 we have
investigated. The data points of any measure1-measure2
correlation plot lie on the data points of the averaged

ensemble. This seems to indicate that indeed diﬀerent
measures are equivalent to each other and that, in or-
der to characterize how important diﬀerent nodes are, it
might be suﬃcient to look at the degree, which is a lo-
cal quantity and simple to calculate. Note that the ER
model is the most simple model considered here, and be-
low we will ﬁnd examples, in particular for real networks,
which exhibit a much more complex behavior. Neverthe-
less, even the ER networks show a behavior in one case,
which appears to be very strange. We observe some sort
of clustering in the the correlation-plot of betweenness
against RDW betweenness as can be seen in the scatter
plot over all instances in Fig. 1 for the large edge prob-
ability p = 0.1. It seems that there are essentially two
types of nodes belonging to two diﬀerent correlation func-
tions. Note that this splitting into two diﬀerent behaviors
is more dominant the higher the edge-probability p of the
generated networks is, i.e. the more likely it is that each
graph of the ensemble consists only of one component.
In particular for graphs with small average degrees up to
50, this behavior is hardly visible. So far, we do not un-
derstand this kind of symmetry breaking. Since the two
measures are identical on star-networks and the random
walk betweenness generally gives higher higher scores for
nodes that lie slightly oﬀ shortest paths in the network,
such local irregularities might be an explanation for this
behavior.

For the Small-World model we have studied values
k = 8, 16, 24 and p = 0.05, 0.10, 0.15. We observe usually
moderately high correlations, but lower than for the ER
model (not shown directly, see below). For the degree-
RDW betweenness correlation, the data points are not
uniformly distributed, similar to the betweenness-RDW
betweenness we have shown for the ER graphs above.
This can be seen here better when looking at the corre-
lation using a three-dimensional plot of impulses, rather
than a scatter plot, see Fig. 2. The ”‘oscillation”’ that
can be observed is also consistently present in the over-

all distribution of the RDW betweenness (averaged over
all degrees). Hence, here also two types of vertices
seem to be present, but the distinction is weaker than
above. Even for very small probabilities (i.e. p = 0.0001,
n = 2000, k = 8) the two peaks are visible though they
are very close together. The gap between the two peaks
gets larger the higher the rewiring probability p. Here,
the diﬀerence seems to be strongly related to the re-
wiring of the nodes, because for the case k = 8, i.e. the
degree of the corresponding p = 0 network, the two peaks
in the distributions are most clearly separated. Even

the random-walk betweenness of a node. The node with a
newly gained edge by rewiring obtains a much higher value
than the others, while the node which lost an edge obtains a
much lower value.

for very small network sizes like 20 nodes, it is possi-
ble to see two diﬀerent peaks. Consider for example
the 20 node network shown in Fig. 3, where just one

nodes with the same degree get diﬀerent values for the
RDW-Betweenness, which become smaller with growing
distance to the most important node. This explains why
the peaks get smeared out: It is because the nodes that
get new edges inﬂuence those nodes that stay the same
from a degree point of view. In general even nodes that
keep their degree constant but gain crosslinks to high
RDW betweenness nodes get a similarly high RDW be-
tweenness. So one explanation of the peaks would be that
the lower peak is a smeared out version of the one-value
peak before rewiring and the the peak for higher RDW
betweenness values appears because rewired nodes get a
much higher RDW betweenness.

FIG. 4: Correlation of degree and RDW betweenness for 100
BA networks with m = 8 and n = 2000.

The Barab´asi-Albert networks, where we have stud-
ied values m ∈ 8, 16, 24, show again almost linear cor-
relations for all combinations of measures. Nevertheless,
the correlations were not as clear as for the Erd˝o-R´enyi
networks, i.e. we observed a much larger scattering of
the data, but in the same order of magnitude as for the
SW graphs. An example can be seen in Fig. 4. Here,
we did not observe any particular strange correlation for
any combination of measures, in contrast to the other
two models.

Hence, to summarize the study of the correlations for
the random graphs (results for the distributions, in par-
ticular exponents in case of power-law behavior, see be-
low), we ﬁnd most of the time a strong correlation be-
tween all diﬀerent centrality measures, hence the degree
is almost suﬃcient to characterize the importance of a
node. This statement is certainly not true for many net-
works based on real-world data, as we will see next.

The AS network exhibits a positive correlation for all
combinations of measures. Nevertheless, the results show
some aspects of the behavior which is strongly diﬀerent
from the networks models discussed previously. E.g. a

for the AS network.

scatter plot of betweenness against RDW betweenness is
shown in Fig. 5. One can see that the scatter of the data
points appears is always very small. This indicates that
the ﬂuctuations generated by the local structure around a
node are always of the same order of magnitude, irrespec-
tively of the absolute value of a quantity. Furthermore,
even more interestingly, we observe that almost all data
points obey the inequality r ≥ b. So far we do not have
an explanation for this eﬀect, which is not present in the
data for the network models.

The calculations on the PIN network presented high
correlations on all combinations of measures (not shown)
except the degree-SC correlation plot, see Fig. 6(a). Here
you can see two ”‘branches”’ that contain the data points.
Thus, there are two types of vertices. For one type,
the number of closed walks increases exponentially with
the degree. This is the behavior, we have for complete
(sub-) graphs (cliques), i.e. where each protein interacts
with each other member of the (sub-) graph. On the
other hand, there are proteins, where the participation
in closed walks does not increase at all with the degree,
which means that these proteins, although possibly with
a large number of interacting partners, participate nev-
ertheless only loosely in the overall interaction network.
Note that for large degrees, there seem to be even pro-
teins, which interpolate between the two limiting behav-
iors. This behavior is quite the diﬀerent to what you ﬁnd
with for example for the BA networks and it is a hint that
the structure of this network cannot be modeled with BA
networks although it degree distribution, which we have
measured as well (see below), is still scale-free. To illus-
trate this we tried to ﬁt a BA network’s degree distri-
bution as good as possible to the degree distribution of
the PIN network and found the best ﬁt for m = 2 and
k0 = −1, although the BA networks for these parame-
ters have generally a smaller maximum degree than the
PIN network. As you can see in Fig. 6(b) the correlation
plots look completely diﬀerent. For diﬀerent values of m

and k0 the scales of the axes change (especially the SC
yields much higher values in the same order of magnitude
as the PIN network) but the generally behavior is con-
sistent. A model for such an interaction network would
have to take the existence of two types of proteins into
account, resulting in two diﬀerent rules for the creation
of the nodes. In a recent study of the PIN network [26]
which also uses a few centrality measures it is found that
high subgraph centrality is a better hint for essential pro-
teins than for example the degree. Thus it ﬁts nicely to
our result that the degree and subgraph centrality are
not strongly correlated in this case.

For the GEOM network the measure1-measure2 corre-
lation plots show a quite scattered behaviour, i.e. much
smaller correlations than seen in the network models, see
e.g. Fig. 7. Here we also observe the r ≥ b feature in

the betweenness-RDW betweenness correlation plot, see
Fig. 8. but the eﬀect is even stronger in comparison to
Fig. 5. Hence, this inequality might be a property seen in
many networks based on real-world data and it certainly
deserves a more thorough investigation.

For the ECOLI network, the correlations of the mea-
sures range from moderately correlated highly to highly
In principle, the plots look

quite similar to those of the AS network. Here we could
not observe any particular new properties, hence we do
not go into further details for this network type.

Finally, we look just at the distribution of the central-
ity measures for the real-world networks. We ﬁnd that all
the real networks show a scale-free behavior, see e.g. Fig.
10. We have ﬁtted power laws P (x) ∝ xγ to all data ex-
cept for the the subgraph centrality, where the data was
distributed only over a small interval, so a ﬁt would be
meaningless. The power-law exponents we calculated can
be found in table I. This shows that when just looking
at the distributions of centrality measures, the behavior
of the real-world network is also found for the BA model.
Goh et al.
[25] also found that for this model the be-
tweeness distribution follows a power law. Only when
considering correlations between diﬀerent measures, one
realizes that the so-far existing models, although having
provided much value insight, have to be extended and/
or modiﬁed, to really capture the behavior found in the
behavior of proteins, metabolic pathways, humans and
other systems represented by networks.

VI. CONCLUSION

8

In this paper we have studied four diﬀerent local and
global centrality measures to analyze the behavior of dif-
ferent model and real-world networks. First, the choice
which measure is “most suitable” depends on the net-
work that is used and which kind of information shall be
extracted by calculating that measure. There does not
seem to be an overall best measure that is optimal for all
applications. The shortest-path betweenness might be
feasible if the network can be assumed to contain global
knowledge of optimal routes. But even in this case, when
much traﬃc is on the network, it is certainly very often
advisable to use non-shortest paths to reach the destina-
In cases where participation
tion as quick as possible.
in social sub-groups is of interest the subgraph central-
ity might be best whereas in situations where each node
only passes information randomly to its nearest neighbors
the random-walk betweenness should be the method of
choice.

Nevertheless, in order to understand really how a net-
work is organized, it sees not to be suﬃcient to study just
one measure and its distribution. We have seen that for
all real-world networks considered here, the distributions
of all measures is indeed well described by power laws.
But when considering correlations between diﬀerent cen-
trality measures we see that the most common random
network models reﬂect the truth only partially since the
scatter plots do look quite diﬀerent compared to the real
networks.

It seems that network models have to be more specif-
ically for each application. One single mechanism like
preferential attachment, at least if being used as the only
mechanism to create the graph, is too simple to explain
the complex properties of real-world networks. Models
that incorporate evolution and growth of networks as
represented for example in [23] might be the key to give
deeper insight why many networks show a scale-free be-
havior for one of their properties and still diﬀer from sim-
pler models like the BA model. Since each application
will need its speciﬁc mechanism to generate a network,
proposing new models for speciﬁc applications is beyond
the scope of this work.

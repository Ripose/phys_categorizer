Summary. Complex systems comprise a large number of interacting elements, whose dy-
namics is not always a priori known. In these cases – in order to uncover their key features
– we have to turn to empirical methods, one of which was recently introduced by Menezes
and Barabási. It is based on the observation that for the activity fi(t) of the constituents there
α
is a power law relationship between the standard deviation and the mean value: σi ∝ hfii
.
For stock market trading activity (traded value), good scaling over 5 orders of magnitude with
the exponent α = 0.72 was observed. The origin of this non-trivial scaling can be traced
back to a proportionality between the rate of trades hN i and their mean sizes hV i. One ﬁnds
hV i ∝ hN i
for the ∼ 1000 largest companies of New York Stock Exchange. Model inde-
pendent calculations show that these two types of scaling can be mapped onto each other, with
an agreement between the error bars. Finally, there is a continuous increase in α if we look at
ﬂuctuations on an increasing time scale up to 20 days.

1 Introduction

Although there is no generally recognized deﬁnition of complex systems, one of their
widely accepted properties is that they comprise a large number of interacting con-
stituents (or nodes) whose collective behavior forms spatial and/or temporal struc-
tures. Some of them are labeled "physical" because they are treated in the regular
framework of physics. Nevertheless, the above scheme itself applies to a much wider
range of systems, including the world economy consisting of companies that trade
and compete. Human agents can interact with each other, e.g., by social networks
or on the trading ﬂoor. We have little or no a priori knowledge about the laws gov-
erning these systems. Thus, very often our approach must be empirical. Recently, an
increasing number of such systems have become possible to monitor through mul-
tichannel measurements. These offer the possibility to record and characterize the
simultaneous time dependent behavior of many of the constituents. On the ground of
these new datasets, an emerging technique (de Menezes and Barabási 2004a) seems
to be able to grasp important features of the internal dynamics in a model indepen-
dent framework.

2 Scaling of ﬂuctuations in complex systems

The method is based on a scaling relation that is observed for a growing range of sys-
tems: The standard deviation σi and time average hfii of the signal fi(t) capturing
the time dependent activity of elements i = 1, . . . , N follows the power law

where we deﬁne

σi ∝ hfiiα ,

σi =

(fi − hfii)2

and h·i denotes time averaging.

This relationship is not unmotivated from a physicist’s point of view. The con-
stant α – while not a universal exponent in the traditional sense – is indeed the ﬁnger-
print of the microscopic dynamics of the system. Applications range from Internet
trafﬁc through river networks to econophysics. The latest advances (Menezes and
Barabási 2004b, Eisler and Kertész 2005) have shown several possible scenarios
leading to various scaling exponents:

1. The value α = 1 always prevails in the presence of a dominant external driving
force. An example is web page visitation statistics. Here the main contribution
to ﬂuctuations comes from the ﬂuctuating number of users surﬁng the web: a
factor that is not intrinsic in the structure of the network. The situation is very
similar for networks of roads or rivers.

2. There are systems, where the different mean activity of constituents comes ex-
clusively from a different mean number of events. Individual events have the
same mean contribution (impact) to a node’s activity, only for more active nodes
more of these events occur. When the central limit theorem is applicable to the
events, α = 1/2. This behavior was observed for the logical elements of a com-
puter chip and the data trafﬁc of Internet routers.

3. Two mechanisms have been documented so far that can give rise to an interme-

diate value 1/2 < α < 1:
a) Because of the competition of external driving and internal ﬂuctuations, it
is possible that σ’s measured for ﬁnite systems display a crossover between
α = 1/2 and α = 1 at a certain node strength hf i. Then there exists an
effective, intermediate value of α, but actual scaling breaks down.

b) The other possibility is related to a very distinct character of internal dynam-
ics: when elements with higher activity do not only experience more events,
but those are also of larger impact. We call this property impact inhomo-
geneity. Stock market trading belongs to this third group with α ≈ 0.72 for
short time scales (see also Eisler et al. 2005).

In a recent model (Eisler and Kertész 2005), the effect of impact inhomogeneity
has been studied. Tokens are deposited on a Barabási-Albert network (Albert and
Barabási 2002) and they are allowed to jump from node to node in every time step.
Activity is generated when they arrive to a site. Every token that steps to a node i

generates an impact Vi whose mean depends on the node degree ki: hVii ∝ kβ
gives rise to a scaling relation:

i . This

The result of Eisler and Kertész (2005) can then then be generalized as

hVii ∝ hNiiβ .

α =

1 +

1
2 (cid:18)

β
β + 1 (cid:19)

.

(4)

Simulation results shown in Fig. 1(a) are in perfect agreement with formula (4). This
is an example that the value of α is basically determined by this impact inhomogene-
ity. If β = 0, i.e., the mean impact generated on all nodes is equal regardless of their
degree, one recovers α = 1/2. When β > 0, the events on more frequently visited
nodes are also larger on average. Correspondingly, α > 1/2.

3 Application to stock market data

Let us now turn to the case of the stock market. Data for the period 2000–2002
was taken from the TAQ Database (New York Stock Exchange 2003). We deﬁne the
activity fi(t) of stock i as the capital ﬂow in time windows of size ∆t. In window
t, fi(t) is the sum of Ni(t) trading events. If we denote the value exchanged in the
n’th trade of time window t by Vi(t; n), then the total traded value of stock i is

fi(t) =

Vi(t; n).

(5)

Ni(t)

Xn=1

Then, hV i is the mean value per trade, while hN i is the mean rate of trades.

As we wish to calculate the mean and the standard deviation of this activity, it is
essential that these quantities at least exist. Traded volumes and consequently traded
values fi(t) are often considered to have a power law tail (P rob(f > x) ∝ x−λ)
with an exponent λi ∼ 1.5 − 1.7 (Gopikrishnan et al. 2000). This would imply, that
the standard deviation is already divergent. Recent measurements, however, indicate
that both of these quantities exist and that there is no unique λi for a stock (Eisler
and Kertész unpublished).

Then, it is possible to test the scaling relation (1) and one ﬁnds good scaling over
more than 5 orders of magnitude in hf i with α ≈ 0.72. This is a value which can be
– at least partly – explained in terms of impact inhomogeneity. We found1 that for the
stocks of the ∼ 1000 largest companies of NYSE, β = 0.69 ± 0.09 (see Fig. 1(b)).
Substituting this into (4) we expect α = 0.71±0.01, which is very close to the actual
result seen from Fig. 2(a). Note that although large error bars prevent us from testing
(4) for smaller stocks, we still ﬁnd that the scaling law (1) holds. The exponent is
unchanged, but this can only be explained by a detailed analysis of ﬂuctuations.
1 The result is qualitatively similar to those of Zumbach (2004) for the FTSE 100. He shows
that both hN i and hV i scale as power laws with company capitalization for large compa-
nies. Capitalization dependence can be eliminated to recover (3).

Dots show raw results for each stock (shifted vertically for better visibility), the ﬁtted slope is
αraw = 0.733 ± 0.004. Diamonds show average σ’s for multiple stocks in a range of log hf i.
This method corrects for bias that comes from the large number of stocks with low hf i, one
ﬁnds αbinned = 0.720 ± 0.007. (b) The dependence of α on the time window ∆t for the
NYSE data. One ﬁnds that up to ∆t = 1 min, α ≈ 0.72, as expected from independent
approximations. Then by increasing ∆t, the value of α increases. This is due to the presence
of strong autocorrelations in the activities f (t) stemming from the clustering of trades.

The mechanism leading to non-trivial α via the scaling (3) can be considered
dominant only if the events are not strongly correlated. This condition is satisﬁed
for short time windows ∆t, when hN i ≪ 1. Interestingly, the value of α does not
change noticably up to ∆t ∼ 1 min. There is, however, another effect that is rele-
vant to the value of α for longer time windows. For the NYSE data, α(∆t) increases
continuously with ∆t (see Fig. 2(b)). Previously (Eisler et al. 2005) this was at-
tributed to the growing inﬂuence of external news: a kind of "driving". With longer

time given for information to spread, the system was assumed to converge to the
externally driven limit α = 1. That mechanism would, however, lead to a crossover
to α = 1 with increasing ∆t (Menezes and Barabási 2004b). What is observed, is
in fact not a crossover. There is no breakdown of scaling as a function of hf i for
intermediate ∆t’s as one would expect between the regime of the two limiting expo-
nents (Menezes and Barabási 2004b). On the other hand, it is well known (see, e.g.,
Gopikrishnan et al. 2000), that the number of trades Ni(t) is correlated. Individual
trades tend to cluster together and this causes enhanced ﬂuctuations in Ni(t). This
mechanism sets in at time windows for which the probability for two trades to coin-
cide is no longer negligible. The scaling law (1) itself is preserved, but the exponent
α is strongly affected.

4 Conclusions

In the above we have outlined a recent type of scaling analysis for the ﬂuctuations of
activity in complex systems. We have shown that systems can be classiﬁed according
to the scaling exponents α. Then we have discussed how impact inhomogeneity and
long range correlations give rise to non-trivial scaling exponents. Further research
should clarify the interplay between ﬂuctuations in the number of trades and in traded
volumes/values in order to deepen the understanding of the market mechanism.

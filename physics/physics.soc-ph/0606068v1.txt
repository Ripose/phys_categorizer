Bose-Einstein condensation in a simple model of economy and emergence of
Pareto-tails in wealth distributions

We present a simple microscopic model of economy to explain the Pareto law in tails of wealth
distributions. Our model is a kind of the so-called Monkey class urn model in which N urns (might
be regarded as people in society) share M = ρN balls (might be regarded as money) under global
constraint (a conservation of the total amount of money) : n1+· · ·+nN = M , where ni (i = 1, · · · , N )
means the number of balls in the i-th urn. Each urn possesses its own energy E(ni). Then, we
evaluate the probability P (k) that an arbitrary urn has k balls by using statistical mechanics. If
we choose the energy function as E(ni) = ǫini, where ǫi means energy level of i-th urn obeying
some distribution (density of states) D(ǫ) ∼ ǫα, we ﬁnd that below the critical temperature at high
density level (ρ ≡ M/N ≫ 1), Bose-Einstein condensation occurs and most of the urns falls in the
lowest energy level ǫ = 0. As the result, the distribution function P (k) changes its scaling behavior
from the exponential k−3/2 e−k-law to the k−(α+2) Pareto-law in large k regime. This transition
between the exponential law to the Pareto law might be regarded as a kind of economic revolution
from planned economy to market economy. We also discuss the probability P (k) for the Ehrenfest
class urn model in heterogeneous heat bath and the so-called Backgammon model.

INTRODUCTION

Population of wealth (or income) decreases following power law for the richest 5-10 % of the population. This fact
observed by the Italian economist Vilfredo Federico Damaso Pareto in 1896 is well-known as Pareto law [1] (which
is sometimes referred to as Zipf law or Zipf-Mandelbrot law in the context of social networks or complex systems).
Up to now, a lot of studies have been done to explain the Pareto law and its mechanism from view points of various
research ﬁelds. In spite of these attempts, there is few work to show why and how the Pareto law emerges as a result
of many body problems.

As such previous extensive studies, Angle [2] introduced an interacting particle model and evaluated their collective
behavior by computer simulations. Bouchaud and Mezard [3] proposed evolutionary equations with respect to wealth
of individuals and solved it via the Fokker-Plank approach in the mean-ﬁeld limit. They found that the equilibrium
distribution of the wealth follows the Pareto law and below some critical Pareto index, wealth condensation takes place,
namely, the economy is dominated by a few individuals. Dr˘agulescu and Yakonenko [4] used the so-called transfer
model in which the economic system is closed, that is, the total amount of money and the number of economic agents
are ﬁxed. Chattejee et.al. [5] shows the emergence of the Pareto law by ideal gas modeling of markets with money
saving properties. Besides these microscopic agents models, Fujiwara et.al.
[6] showed by some phenomenological
arguments that the Pareto law is derived under the assumption of the detail valance and the so-called Gibrat law. A
part of the other interesting studies was reported in the proceedings of recent workshop [7].

Although these studies are nice to explain the Pareto law, some other microscopic models of economy should be
proposed and systematic analysis of them seem to be needed to discuss the collective behavior of agents in markets,
especially, the condition on which the Pareto law in wealth distribution emerges.
Recently, in the research ﬁeld of complex networks [8, 9], Ohkubo et. al.

[10] proposed a network model which
is well-known as Ehrenfest class preferential urn model [11] to explain how the complex network exhibits so-called
scale-free properties. In the model he dealt with, each urn corresponds to node in graph (network) and the number of
distinguishable balls in each urn is regarded as degree of vertex (node). For this model system, he succeeded in deriving
k−1(log k)−1 in the probability of the degree of vertexes within the replica symmetric theory
the scale-free properties
[12, 13]. However, as a complex network in which geometrical structures are supposed to be important, the model

∼

∗e-mail: j˙inoue@complex.eng.hokudai.ac.jp

is limited in order to investigate the network geometry beyond the statistical properties of the degree of vertexes.
In that sense, the urn model is much more suitable to explain how the wealth (or income) of the society follows the
power law behavior, namely, to investigate the condition on which the Pareto law emerges in the tail of the wealth
distribution.

In this paper, we present a simple model of economy to explain the Pareto law in wealth distributions. Our model
is a kind of so-called Monkey class urn model [11, 14] in which N non-distinguishable urns (might be regarded as
people in society) share M = ρN balls (might be regarded as money) under global constraint (a conservation of the
total amount of money) : n1 + n2 +
, N ) means the number of balls in the i-th
urn. Each urn possesses its own energy function E(ni). Then, we evaluate the probability P (k) that an arbitrary
urn has k balls by using statistical mechanics. For a speciﬁc choice of the energy function, we ﬁnd that below the
critical temperature at high density level (ρ
1), Bose-Einstein condensation occurs and most of the urns
falls in the lowest energy level. As the result, the distribution function P (k) changes its scaling behavior from the
exponential k−3/2 e−k-law to the k−(α+2) Pareto-law in large k regime.

This paper is organized as follows. In the next Sec. II, we introduce the general formalism for the urn model with
general energy function E(ni) (i = 1,
, N ) for each urn. The general class urn model contains both Ehrenfest
and Monkey classes as its special cases. We explain the relation between the saddle point that determines the
thermodynamic properties of the system and the chemical potential. With the assistance of this general formalism,
we provide an analysis for a special choice of the energy function, which is an example of exactly solvable models
in Sec. III. We discuss the condition on which the Pareto law appears in the tail of the wealth distribution for the
, N ) for
solvable model. In Sec. IV, we show that for the special choice of the energy function E(ni) = ǫini (i = 1,
each urn of the monkey class, the Bose-Einstein condensation occurs and the Pareto law emerges in the probability
distribution of balls put in an arbitrary urn. In Sec. V, we mention about the probability P (k) for the other models,
namely, the Ehrenfest class urn model in heterogeneous heat bath and the so-called Backgammon model.

· · ·

Last section is a part of discussion. In this section, we compare the results of our analysis with several studies from

empirical data. The diﬀerence between them and its possible explanations are also discussed.

II. GENERAL CLASS URN MODEL

We ﬁrst formulate the general class of the urn model which contains both Ehrenfest and Monkey classes as its two
special cases. Let us prepare N urns and M balls (M
ρN ) and consider the situation in which the N urns share
the M balls. Then, we start our argument from the Ehrenfest class urn model [11] in which each ball in urns is
distinguishable. For the mathematical model categorized in the Ehrenfest class, the probability p(ni) that i-th urn
possesses ni balls is given by

≡

p(ni) =

exp [

βE(ni)]
−
ni!

where we consider that each urn is put in the homogeneous heat bath, namely, the inverse temperature for each urn
is given by βi = β for all i. However, as we shall mention in Sec. V, it is possible for us to consider the case of the
heterogeneous heat baths, that is, each urn is put in the heat bath speciﬁed by urn-dependent inverse temperature
βi.

For the Ehrenfest class, the probability that an urn speciﬁed by inverse temperature β possesses k balls is given by

III. EXACTLY SOLVABLE URN MODEL FOR THE EHRENFEST CLASS

As an demonstration of the Ehrenfest urn model whose thermo-dynamic properties are speciﬁed by equations (7)
and (8), we introduce a kind of solvable models and consider the condition on which the Pareto law appears. To this
end, we choose the energy function E(n) as

where ǫ means an urn-dependent disorder of the system taking a value in the range [0, 1] randomly. The tendency of
this energy function to force each urn of the system to gather balls as much as possible results in the fact that the
rich get richer as its collective behavior. For this choice of the energy function (15), the saddle point equation (7)

IV. BOSE-EINSTEIN CONDENSATION AND EMERGENCE OF THE PARETO LAW

In the previous section, we evaluated the asymptotic form of the income distribution P (k) for the urn model of
ǫn. Obviously, for each urn, to gather balls as much as possible is
the Ehrenfest class with energy function E(n) =
suitable strategy from the view point of the energy cost. In that sense, this case should be referred by the concept the
rich get richer in the context of social networks. However, by using the general deﬁnition of the problem, we freely
choose the energy function for both the Ehrenfest and Monkey classes.

−

For the Monkey class urn model whose thermo-dynamic properties are deﬁned by equations (12) (13) and (14), we

evaluate P (β, k) for a speciﬁc choice of energy function E(n). In this section, we choose the energy E(n) as

E(n) = ǫn

(35)

= 0 is hard
where we should notice that for this simple choice of the energy function, the urn (a man) labeled by ǫ
to gather the balls (money). On the other hand, the urn (a man) with ǫ = 0 energy level easily gathers (earns)
the balls (money). In this sense, the urn model with this type of energy function does not agree with the concept
of preferential which indicates the rich get richer. Nevertheless, we use the energy function because as we shall see

below, the condensation of the urns occurs for this choice of energy function, and as the result, the Pareto law in the
tail of the wealth distribution emerges. This section is a central part of this paper.

If we choose D(ǫ) as the density of state, namely, degeneracy of the energy level of the urn, we rewrite the saddle

point equation (12) as follows.

Thus, for a given density ρ, the saddle point equation to be solved is B(zs) = 1. It should be noticed that for T > Tc,
the ﬁrst term appearing in the equation (42), namely, ρǫ6=0 = (T /Tc)3/2(b3/2(zs)/ζ(3/2)) becomes dominant in (42)
and almost all of the urns has non-zero energy level ǫ

in (42), that is, ρǫ=0 = (1/ρ)zs/(1
zs) becomes dominant in the equation (42) and almost all of the urns becomes
to condense into zero-energy level ǫ = 0. Thus, the Bose-Einstein condensation in the energy level of the urns occurs.
In FIG. 2, we plot the (T /Tc), ρ-dependence of the function B(zs). The solution of the saddle point equation (42)
corresponds to the intersection of the lines B = B(zs) and B = 1. The left panel of FIG. 2 shows behavior of
B(zs) at low temperature regime T /Tc = 0.0001, whereas the right panel is plotted at the high temperature regime
T /Tc = 1.2. For each panel, the function B(zs) is plotted for the case of ρ = 1, 10 and 100. We ﬁnd that Bose-Einstein
condensation occurs at low temperature and hight density ρ

the saddle point equation B(zs) = 1.

these two panels, we found that the Pareto law k−5/2 emerges when the Bose-Einstein condensation occurs. From the
view point of the saddle point, this condensation takes place if and only if zs = 1 is satisﬁed. The numerical analysis
of the probability (43) in the limit of k
is easily convinced by asymptotic analysis of equation (43). We easily
conﬁrm that the asymptotic form of the wealth distribution P (β, k) behaves as

From this result, we conclude that the Bose-Einstein condensation is speciﬁed by the transition from the exponential
law to the Pareto law. In other wards, the Bose-Einstein condensation in the urn model is characterized by emergence
of the Pareto law of the tail in the wealth distribution P (β, k).

A physical interpretation of the result (45) is given as follows. If the saddle point equation (42) has a solution
= 0. Then, from the energy function E = ǫn, few urns earn
zs < 1, almost all of the urns stays in the state of ǫ
k−3/2e−k. On
many balls, and as the result, the probability distribution for the number of balls behaves as P (β, k)
1, the Bose-Einstein condensation
the other hand, below the critical temperature T < Tc at high density level ρ
occurs and the solution of the saddle point equation (42) leads to zs = 1. Then, almost all of the urns condensate
into the lowest energy level ǫ = 0, From the deﬁnition of the energy function E = ǫn, the restriction of the energy
k−3/2e−k-law to
vanishes, and as the result, the distribution of the number of balls changes from the exponential
the

k−5/2 Pareto-law.

V. SOME OTHER MODELS

In this section, we mention about the result for the other choice of the energy function E(n) for both the Ehrenfest
and Monkey classes. In Sec. II, we obtained the general form of the saddle point equation (12) and corresponding
form of the distribution (13). It should be stressed that it is possible for us to analyze any type of the urn model.

A. Ehrenfest urn model in heterogeneous heat bath

We ﬁrst consider the case of the following energy function for the Ehrenfest class :

E(ni) =

log ni!

(i = 1,

, n)

−

· · ·

which was dealt with in the study by [10]. Obviously, this energy function forces each urn (person) to gather the
balls (money) as much as possible. In other words, the rich get richer. In the model they dealt with, each urn is
put in the heterogeneous heat bath at temperature β−1
. Therefore, the urn-dependent randomness appearing in the
system is not the scaling factor of energy but the inverse of temperature. To evaluate the average over the inverse of
temperature, they used the replica method. However, in following, we show that the same saddle point as the replica
symmetric solution [10] can be obtained from the diﬀerent argument by using Jensen’s inequality.

Substituting of the energy function (46) for each urn into equation (7), we obtain the saddle point equation as

We ﬁrst evaluate the saddle point zs as a solution of the equation (47). Due to the complexity of the integrand of
the right hand side of equation (47), it is hard to carry out the integral with respect to β analytically. Therefore, in
following, we apply several approximations to the evaluation of the saddle point.

As a ﬁrst attempt to approximate the solution for (47), we evaluate the integral with respect to β at the upper
bound β = 1 of the integrand. In other words, we consider the case in which each urn is put in the homogeneous heat
bath at temperature T = β−1 = 1. For that evaluation, the sum of the series appearing in (47) converges as

In last part of this paper, we mention about the probability distribution P (β, k) for the Backgammon model

From this expression (59), the energy for each urn decreases if and only if the urn does not have any ball.

For this energy function (46), we easily obtain the saddle point equation and the corresponding probability distri-

bution as follows.

VI. DISCUSSION

In this paper, we introduced a simple microscopic model of economy to explain and discuss the Pareto law in tails
of wealth distributions systematically. We evaluated the probability P (k) that an arbitrary urn has k balls by using
statistical mechanics. We applied our formalism for several urn models of both the Ehrenfest and Monkey classes.
ǫα for the Monkey
Especially, for the choice of the energy function as E(ni) = ǫini with density of state D(ǫ)
class urn model, we found that below the critical temperature T < Tc at high density level ρ
1, the Bose-Einstein
condensation occurs and most of the urns falls in the lowest energy level ǫ = 0. As the result, the distribution function
P (β, k) changes its scaling behavior from the exponential k−3/2 e−k-law to the k−(α+2) Pareto-law in large k regime.
This result might be linked to an economic revolution from planned economy to market economy as follows. In the
society of planned economy, most of people speciﬁed by ǫ
= 0 cannot use or earn money freely. This is because she
or he is restricted so as to minimize her or his own energy E = ǫn. However, once the revolution from the planned
economy to the market economy occurs, people labeled by ǫ = 0 become dominant and they start to earn and use
their money freely neglecting the requirement of minimization of energy E = ǫn. Thus, the urn condensation in our
microscopic model of economy might be regarded as a kind of economic revolution. After the society moves to the
market economy, Pareto-tails in the wealth distributions emerge in our scenario.

∼
≫

We also would like to mention about several empirical data analysis for the Pareto law. In the reference [16], we may
ﬁnd the values of exponent, namely, the so-called Pareto index γ of k−γ is [1.1, 3.34] for USA 1980-2001, [3.47, 5.76] for
UK 1991-2001 and [2.42, 3.96] for Germany 1990-2002. It might be worth while for us to notice that if we choose the
k−(α+2). Thus, it is possible to
ǫα, then, the corresponding Pareto laws becomes
density of state D(ǫ) as D(ǫ)
choose α so as to satisfy α + 2 = γ for the Pareto index. Then, we should remember that D(ǫ) means the distribution
of “psychological barrier” for each person to earn the money. If the slope of the distribution is too sharp, that is, α

∼

12

is large enough, the resultant Pareto index also becomes large. As the result, the fatness of the Pareto-tail decreases.
This is naturally accepted, however, the microscopic explanation for the shape of the distribution D(ǫ) is strongly
dependent on the society or the business (whether the business is bad or good in that period). In other words, the
density D(ǫ) should be determined by the strategy of decision (save money or purchase something) for each person.
In addition, the D(ǫ) might change its shape during long-time intervals. Of course, the model we presented in this
paper is the simplest one and it might be needed to take into account the details of the market etc.

Although in this paper, we devoted our analysis to extremely large income regimes (the tail of the wealth distri-
bution), however, it is quite important for us to consider the full-range of the wealth. As reported in [7], the wealth
distribution for small income regime follows the Gibbs/Log-normal law and a kind of transition to the Pareto-law
phase is observed. For the full-range distribution of the wealth, the so-called Lorentz curve [18, 19, 20] is obtained.
The Lorentz curve is given in terms of the relation between the cumulative distribution of wealth and the fraction of
the total wealth. Then, the so-called Gini coeﬃcient [18, 19, 20], which is a traditional, a popular and one of the most
basic measures for earning diﬀerentials, could be calculated. To evaluate these two quantities for our model systems
is our future problem.

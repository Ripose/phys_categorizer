We investigate the ﬁnancial network in the Korean stock exchange (KSE) market, using both
numerical simulations and scaling arguments. We estimate the cross-correlation on the stock price
exchanges of all companies listed on the the Korean stock exchange market, where all companies are
fully connected via weighted links, by introducing a weighted random graph. The degree distribution
and the edge density are discussed numerically from the market graph, and the statistical analy-
sis for the degree distribution of vertices is particularly found to approximately follow the power law.

Recently, many interests have been concentrated on
small-world and scale-free network models [1] in the phys-
ical, biological, social and technological networks. The
small-world network, proposed by Watts and Strogatz
[2], has provided the connected properties represented
by single component graphs. The real-world models are
indeed characterized by the small world and clustering
property, e.g., social networks [3], the internet [4], docu-
ment retrieval in www[5], scientiﬁc cooperation relations
[6], social networks of acquaintances [7] and of collabora-
tions [8]. The static and dynamic behaviors extensively
have studied on small-world networks, and the prominent
topics for small-world networks really have a direct appli-
cation in statistical mechanics and polymer physics [9].
Until now, the ﬁnancial market networks are extensively
used in various types of ﬁnancial applications [10].

Furthermore, the self-organized behavior of individu-
als, companies, capitalists, or nations has concentrated
on forming macroscopic patterns such as commodity
prices, stock prices, and exchange rates. There have ex-
isted many statistical quantities that play a crucial role
in describing the properties and patterns of several op-
tions in ﬁnancial markets. One of the most important
quantities among them is the auto-correlation between
companies. Until now, there have been many researches
to estimate numerically the correlation in price changes,
using the random matrix theory inﬂuenced on the collec-
tive behavior in ﬁnancial markets [11 − 13].

Our purpose of this paper is to investigate the ﬁnancial
network in the KSE. We ﬁnd the cross-correlation on
the stock price exchanges of all companies listed on the
Korean stock exchange market of 2003, and the degree

Let Ri(t) be the return of stock price deﬁned by

Ri(t) = ln[

where Pi(t) is the stock price of company i at time t,
and t0 is a time lag. Since the cross-correlation between
individual stocks are represented in terms of a matrix C,
its correlation coeﬃcient is calculated as

Degree

Correlation Threshold

for θ = 0.5, where P (θ) ∼ θ−β with the scaling exponent
β = 0.91.

density in the market graph, we introduce as follows: The
set of companies represent the set of vertices of the graph.
For any pair of companies (vertices) i and j, An con-
nected edge for any pair of companies (vertices) i and j
is added to the market graph if the corresponding correla-
tion coeﬃcient Cij is greater than or equal to a speciﬁed
threshold value θ. The degree probability that a vertex
of the market graph has a edge θ follows a power law as

P (θ) ∝ θ−β.

For the degree distribution, we found the results of com-
putational simulation of our model with diﬀerent thresh-
old value. As the correlation threshold value is increased
larger than θ = 0.4, the degree distribution resembles a
power law.
It is shown by using least-squares method
that the degree distributions of ﬁnancial market network
for θ = 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 grow, respectively, as a power
law with scaling exponents β = 0.76, 0.91 (Fig. 2), and
1.15. We also found that the degree distribution in the
range with θ < 0.4 and θ > 0.6 do not follow a power
law, diﬀerent to that of the recent work [14]. In Fig. 3,
The edge density as a function of diﬀerent values of the
correlation threshold θ in ﬁnancial market networks is
plotted in the range with θ > 0. Fig. 4 shows the largest
connected edge density as a function of the correlation
threshold value θ in ﬁnancial market networks.

In conclusion, we have studied the market graph in the
Korean stock exchange market and discussed the cross-
correlation, the degree distribution, and the edge density
on the stock price exchanges of all companies listed on
the KSE of 2003. Especially, We found that the degree
distributions for 0.4 ≤ θ ≤ 0.6 follow a power law. It is in
future expected that the detail description of the market
graph will be used to study the extension of ﬁnancial
analysis in the Korean and foreign ﬁnancial markets.

Correlation Threshold

where the brackets denotes the time average over the
transacted period. From Eq. (1), the corresponding cor-
relation coeﬃcient have one value between [1, −1]. If the
coeﬃcient Ci,j = 1(−1), Two companies i and j are cor-
related (anti-correlated) if the coeﬃcient Ci,j = 1(−1),
while they are uncorrelated if Ci,j = 0. It is well known
the largest eigenvalue is non-degenerate and real, since
the matrix C is real and symmetric.

The market graph constitutes into the set 554 of com-
panies traded in the the KSE. We analyze daily tick data
for the period Jan/2003-Dec/2003. First of all, as shown
in Fig. 1, we found the distribution of correlation coeﬃ-
cients in Korean stock exchange market, where Ci,j vary
in the range from −1 and 1.

In order to discuss the degree distribution and the edge

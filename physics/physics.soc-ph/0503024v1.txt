The cornerstone of Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) statistical mechanics is the Boltzmann-Gibbs-Jaynes-
Shannon entropy SBG ≡ −k
dx f (x) ln f (x), where k is a positive constant and f (x) a probability
density function. This theory has exibited, along more than one century, great success in the treat-
ment of systems where short spatio/temporal correlations dominate. There are, however, anomalous
natural and artiﬁcial systems that violate the basic requirements for its applicability. Diﬀerent phys-
ical entropies, other than the standard one, appear to be necessary in order to satisfactorily deal
dx [f (x)]q)/(1 − q) (with S1 = SBG),
with such anomalies. One of such entropies is Sq ≡ k (1 −
where the entropic index q is a real parameter. It has been proposed as the basis for a general-
ization, referred to as nonextensive statistical mechanics, of the BG theory. Sq shares with SBG
four remarkable properties, namely concavity (∀q > 0), Lesche-stability (∀q > 0), ﬁniteness of the
entropy production per unit time (q ∈ ℜ), and additivity (for at least a compact support of q in-
cluding q = 1). The simultaneous validity of these properties suggests that Sq is appropriate for
bridging, at a macroscopic level, with classical thermodynamics itself.
In the same natural way
that exponential probability functions arise in the standard context, power-law tailed distributions,
even with exponents out of the L´evy range, arise in the nonextensive framework. In this review, we
intend to show that many processes of interest in economy, for which fat-tailed probability functions
are empirically observed, can be described in terms of the statistical mechanisms that underly the
nonextensive theory.

INTRODUCTION

The concept of “entropy” (from the greek τ ρoπ ´η, transformation), was introduced in 1865 by Rudolf Julius Em-
manuel Clausius in the context of Thermodynamics[1]. This was motivated by his studies on reversible and irreversible
transformations, as a measure of the amount of energy in a physical system, that cannot be used to perform work.
More speciﬁcally, Clausius deﬁned change in entropy of a thermodynamic system, during some reversible process
where a certain amount of heat δQ is transported at constant temperature T , as δS = δQ/T . We can consider en-
tropy as the cornerstone of Thermodynamics, since all the thermodynamical principles involve, directly or indirectly,
this fundamental concept.

The ﬁrst connection between the macroscopic Clausius’ entropy of a system and its microscopic conﬁgurations was
done by Ludwig Boltzmann in 1877 [1]. Studying the approach to equilibrium of an “ideal” gas [2], he realized that
the entropy could be related to the number of possible microstates compatible with the thermodynamic properties of
the gas. For an isolated system in its terminal stationary state (thermal equilibrium), Boltzmann observation can be
expressed as

where k is a positive constant and W the number of microstates consistent with the macroscopic state. This famous
equation, known as Boltzmann principle, can be regarded as a pillar in the foundations of statistical mechanics, which
aims to describe the thermodynamic state of a system through the statistical approach of its microstates.

refers to microscopic states, the Boltzmann principle should be derivable from microscopic dynamics. However, the
implementation of such calculation has not been yet achieved. Consequently, BG statistical mechanics still remains
based on hypothesis such as Boltzmann’s Stosszahlansatz (molecular chaos hypothesis)[2] and ergodicity [4]. It can
be easily shown that entropy (2) is nonnegative, concave, experimentally robust (or Lesche-stable)[3, 5], and leads to a
ﬁnite entropy production per unit time[6]. Moreover, it is additive. In other words, if A and B are two probabilistically
independent subsystems, i.e., pA+B

j , then it is straightforwardly veriﬁed that

= pA

i pB

ij

SBG (A + B) = SBG (A) + SBG (B) ,

hence, if we have N subsystems, SBG(N ) = N SBG(1), where the notation is self-explanatory. More generally, when
correlations are “weak” enough, SBG is extensive, i.e., such that the limN→∞ SBG(N )/N is ﬁnite.

Despite the lack of ﬁrst-principle derivations, Boltzmann-Gibbs statistical mechanics has a history plenty of successes
in the treatment of systems where short spatio/temporal interactions dominate. This kind of interactions favor
ergodicity and independence properties, necessary in Khinchin’s approach of SBG [4]. Consequently, it is perfectly
plausible that physical entropies other than the Boltzmann-Gibbs one can be deﬁned in order to suitably treat
anomalous systems, for which ergodicity and/or independence are not veriﬁed. As examples of anomalies we can
mention: metastable states in long-range interacting Hamiltonian systems, metaequilibrium states in small systems
(i.e., systems whose number of particles is much smaller than Avogrado’s number), glassy systems, some types of
dissipative systems, systems that in some way violate ergodicity, and, last but not least, systems with non-Markovian
memory, like it seems to be the case of ﬁnancial ones. Generically speaking, systems that may possibly have a
multifractal, scale-free or hierarchical structure in the occupancy of their phase space.

Motivated by this scenario, one of us proposed in 1988 the entropy[7]

which generalizes SBG, such that limq→1 Sq = SBG, as the basis of a possible generalization of Boltzmann-Gibbs
from microscopic dynamics.
statistical mechanics[8] and where the entropic index q should be determined a priori
Just like SBG, Sq is nonnegative, concave, experimentally robust (or Lesche-stable) (
q > 0), and leads to a ﬁnite
entropy production per unit time ([9] and references therein). Moreover, it has been recently shown[10] that it is also

Since its proposal, entropy (3) has been the source of numerous results in both fundamental and applied physics as
well as in other scientiﬁc areas such as biology, chemistry, economics, geophysics and medicine [11]. It is our purpose
here to review some new results concerning applications to economics and more speciﬁcally to the theory of ﬁnances.

II. PROBABILITY DENSITY FUNCTIONS FROM THE VARIATIONAL PRINCIPLE

Before discussing some speciﬁc quantities of ﬁnancial interest, let us see the form of the probability density function

naturally derived from the variational principle related to entropy (3). We consider its continuous version, i.e.,

It is noteworthy that,
averages weighted with a function of the probabilities as in (5)-(6) allow to mimic the way individuals behave in face
to risky choices[12] (see also [13]). In fact, the prospect theory proposed by Kahneman and Tversky[14] for analyzing
decision-making under risk, is founded on the concept of “decision weights” that can be modeled by akin functional
forms[15].

For q = 3+m

1+m , the q-Gaussian form recovers the Student’s t-distribution with m degrees of freedom (m = 1, 2, 3, . . .).
Consistently, for q > 1, (8) presents an asymptotic power-law behavior. Also, if q = n−4

recovers the r-distribution with n degrees of freedom. Consistently, for q < 1, p (x) has a compact support which is

Many other entropic forms have been introduced in the literature for various interesting purposes. One of the

advantages of entropy (3) is that it yields power-law tails, which play a particularly relevant role, as well known.

→ ∞

Let us recall succinctly the two basic central limit theorems: (1) A convoluted distribution with a ﬁnite second
moment approaches, in the limit of N
convolutions, a Gaussian attractor; (2) A convoluted distribution with a
divergent second moment, approaches, in the same limit, a L´evy distribution Lγ(x) (with 0 < γ < 2)[16]. However,
through dynamics diﬀerent from the convolution one, for instance with some sort of memory across successive steps
(i.e., nonindependence of the successive distributions), diﬀerent ubiquitous distributions might arise (see also [10]).
If the Laplacian term in the linear diﬀusion equation is a standard second derivative or a fractional derivative, the
Gaussian or the L´evy distributions are respectively attained as solutions. However, much more complex and rich
dynamics clearly exist in nature, for example those associated with a variety of nonlinear Fokker-Planck equations
involving nontrivial correlations, multiplicative noise or other eﬀects, as we will see in the following Section. Moreover,
simple convolutions allow only for asymptotic behavior like the q = 1 (Gaussian) or q > 5/3 (L´evy distributions)
ones. But they do not allow fat-tailed distributions associated with 1 < q
5/3. However, many complex systems in
nature as well as in social sciences exhibit exponents which precisely belong to that interval. An example of ﬁnancial
interest is exhibited in Fig 1.

III. UNDERLYING STOCHASTIC PROCESSES

The Gaussian distribution, recovered in the limit q

1 of expression (8), can be derived on a variety of grounds.
For instance, it has been derived, through arguments based on the dynamics, by L. Bachelier in his 1900 work on price
changes in Paris stock market, and also by A. Einstein in his 1905 article on Brownian motion. In particular, starting
from a Langevin dynamics, one is able to write the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation and, from it, to obtain
as solution the Gaussian distribution. Analogously, it is also possible, from certain classes of stochastic diﬀerential
equations and their associated Fokker-Planck equations, to obtain the distribution given by (8).

→

In this section we will discuss dynamical mechanisms which lead to probability functions with asymptotic power-law

behavior of the q-Gaussian form.

A. Stochastic processes with additive multiplicative structure

Microscopic dynamics containing multiplicative noise may be encountered in many dynamical processes and, due to
its signiﬁcance, has been the subject of numerous studies in the last decades. The presence of additive noise, besides
the multiplicative contribution, is in fact a quite realistic ingredient since not all the ﬂuctuations are processed
multiplicatively. In previous work[18], we considered a class of diﬀerential stochastic equations of the form

˙x = f (x) + g(x)ζ(t) + η(t) ,

where f, g are arbitrary functions of the stochastic variable x, and ζ(t), η(t), two independent zero-mean Gaussian
white noises with variance M 2 and A2, respectively. We have shown that for special forms of the deterministic force,
γg(x)g′(x), the stationary probability density functions (by using the Itˆo prescription) are of the

From the point of view of entropy Sq, the density function (10) derives from the variational principle, under the
constraints of normalization and generalized variance of g(u).

In particular, q-Gaussian distributions can be derived from a stochastic process of the linear form[18, 19, 20, 21]

with q and β deﬁned as above. In the particular case ν = 1 = q the standard Gaussian steady state is obtained,
corresponding to a purely additive process.

Taking into account that empirical returns where found to follow a q-Gaussian distribution[22] (see also Fig. 1),
Eq. (12), complemented by the Itˆo prescription, provides a simple mechanism to model the dynamics of prices. Along
similar lines it has been worked out, for instance, an option-pricing model which is more realistic than the celebrated
Black-Scholes one[22] (recovered as the q = 1 particular case).

The q-exponential character of the solutions of Eq. (14) is not exclusive of the steady state but it also emerges
along the time evolution[18, 23]. In the presence of multiplicative noise, the system variables directly couple to noise.
Therefore, behaviors are observed that can not occur in the presence of additive noise alone. On the other hand
the additive noise plays a fundamental role allowing the existence of a reasonable and normalizable steady state by
avoiding collapse of the distribution at the origin. The particular interplay between additive and multiplicative noises,
as well as that between deterministic and stochastic drifts, can lead to the appearance of q-exponential forms.

The q-exponential distributions include the Boltzmann-Gibbs one as a special case (q = 1). While the latter
= 1 is expected to be related to quasi-stationary or long-living

out-of-equilibrium regimes.

B. Stochastic processes with varying intensive parameters

Intricate dynamical behavior is a common feature of many non-equilibrium systems, which can be also charac-
terized by power-law probability density functions. To this class belong systems whose dynamical behavior shows
spatio/temporal ﬂuctuations of some intensive quantity. This quantity may be the inverse temperature, like in the
case of interactions of hadrons from cosmic rays in emulsion chambers; the energy dissipation in turbulent ﬂuids, or
simply the width of some white noise, as assumed in many ﬁnancial models, such as in the famous Heston model[24].
The connection between this sort of dynamics and nonextensive entropy was ﬁrst made by G. Wilk and Z. W lodarczyk
[25] and later extended by C. Beck and E.G.D. Cohen[26], who called it superstatistics. In this “statistics of statis-
tics”, Beck and Cohen aimed to treat non-equilibrium systems from the point of view of long-living stationary states
characterized by a temporally or spatially ﬂuctuating intensive parameter. Such condition can be mathematically
expressed by

B[E(z)] =

f (β) e−βE(z) dβ

∞

Z
0

(16)

where B[E(z)] is a kind of eﬀective Boltzmann factor, E(z) a function of some relevant variable z, and f (β) the
probability density function of the inverse temperature β. Superstatistics is intimately connected with nonextensive
statistical mechanics. More precisely, it is possible to derive a generalized Boltzmann factor which is exactly B[E],
when f (β) is the Gamma distribution, i.e.,

where the q-exponential functional form of the eﬀective Boltzmann factor turns clearly visible its asymptotic power-
law behavior. It is noteworthy that the above eﬀective Boltzmann factor is also a good approximation for other f (β)
probability density functions [26].

IV. APPLICATIONS TO FINANCIAL OBSERVABLES

A. ARCH(1) and GARCH(1, 1) processes from a nonextensive perspective

The ﬂuctuating character of volatility in ﬁnancial markets has been considered, since a few decades ago, as major
responsible for price change dynamics [27]. In fact, the intermittent character of return time series is usually associated
with localized bursts in volatility and thus called volatility clustering [28]. The temporal evolution of the second-order
moment, known as heteroskedasticity [29], has proven to be of extreme importance in order to deﬁne better performing
option-price models [24, 30, 31]

The ﬁrst proposal aiming to modelize and analyze economical time series with time-varying volatility was made by
R.F. Engle [29], who deﬁned the autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) process. In his seminal article,
Engle stated that a heteroskedastic observable z (e.g., the return) would be deﬁned as

Continuous approaches are becoming more often used (mainly in the treatment of high-frequency data: see, e.g., [31,
35]). Moreover, ARCH-like processes fail in reproducing the volatility autocorrelation function power law behavior[36].
But, despite these facts, the ARCH family of processes (particularly ARCH (1) and GARCH (1, 1)) is still considered
a cornerstone in econometrics due to its simplicity and satisfactory eﬃciency in ﬁnancial time series mimicry.

Having a glance at Eq. (17), we can verify that the distribution P (z) of the stochastic variable z has, at each time step
t, the same functional form of the noise distribution, P (ω), but with a variance σt. This property allows one to look
as a process similar to those occuring in some non-equilibrium systems with a longstanding stationary
at process
state. Speciﬁcally, this principle has allowed to establish, ﬁrstly for ARCH(1) [37] and then for GARCH(1, 1) [38],
a connection between b and c, P (z) and, Pn (ω), the latter assumed to be of the following qn-Gaussian form

and, for b = c = 0, one has q = qn. The validity of Eqs. (21) and (22) is depicted in Fig. 2. The discrepancy between

As one can observe in Fig. 3, the ansatz gives a quite satisfactory description for σ2 probability density function,
suggesting a connection between the ARCH class of processes and nonextensive entropy. These explicit formulas
can be helpful in applications related, among others, to option prices, where volatility forecasting plays a particularly
important role.

index, qop. In Ref. [38], it was veriﬁed the existence of a direct relation between dependence, qop, the non-Gaussianity,
q, and the nature of the noise, qn. An interesting property emerged, namely that, whatever be the pair (b, c) that
results in a certain q for the stationary probability density function, one obtains the same qop and, consequently, the
time series will present the same degree of dependence [38]. See Fig. 4.

It was also veriﬁed (see Fig. 5) for ARCH (1) that the degree of dependence varies visibly with b and with the lag τ
between returns. This dependence would be related to a short-memory in volatility [41]. The variance between these
results and the empirical evidence of persistence in the real return time series dependence degree for time intervals up
to 100 days recently found, shows that ﬁnancial markets dynamics are, in fact, ruled by some form of long-memory
processes in volatility [17].

Let us comment at this point that the connection between several entropic indexes, each one related to a diﬀerent
observable, is compatible with the dynamical scenario within which the nonextensive statistical mechanics is for-
mulated. In fact, several entropic indexes emerge therein, coalescing onto the same value q = 1 when ergodicity is
veriﬁed.

triplets and nevertheless coincide in what concerns the resulting point (q, qop).

FIG. 5: In panel (a) qop versus b for ARCH (1) process. Even for large allowed b values, the decrease of dependence degree
(i.e., increase of qop) is visible when the time lag increases, which is not compatible with the empirical evidence of dependence
degree around qop = 1.275 veriﬁed in Dow Jones return time series for time lags up to 100 days, panel (b). Comparing the two
ﬁgures (a) and (b), it appears that ﬁnancial markets present long-memory in the volatility similar to a ARCH (n) process with
n ≫ 1.

B. Mesoscopic models for traded volume in stock markets

Another important observable in ﬁnancial markets is the traded volume V (the number of shares of a stock traded
in a period of time T ). In Ref. [42] it was proposed an ansatz for the probability density function of high-frequency
traded volume, which presents two power-law regimes (small and large values of V ),

where instead of being constant in time, β varies on a time scale much larger than the time scale of order γ−1 needed
to reach stationarity. The deterministic term of Eq. (24) represents a restoring market mechanism which tries to keep
the traded volume in some typical value Θ = α+1
and the second term reﬂects stochastic memory and, basically, the
β
eﬀect of large traded volumes. In fact, large values of v will provoke large amplitude of the stochastic term, leading
to an increase or decrease of the traded volume (stirred or hush stock) depending on the sign of Wt. The ﬂuctuation
of β, alike to ﬂuctuations in the mean value of v, can be related with changes in the activity volume due to agents
herding mechanism caused by price movements or news.

Solving the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation for Eq. (24) we got the conditional probability of v given β,

Another possible mechanism to describe the dynamics of volumes, has been recently proposed[45] on the basis of

mean-reverting processes with additive-multiplicative structure, namely,

dv =

where, α, µ are positive constants and W1, W2 independent standard Wienner processes. That is, following the
ideas presented in Section III A, in addition to ﬂuctuations endogenously processed by the market, other ﬂuctuations
are taken into account that aﬀect the dynamics directly. The stationary solution of the Fokker-Planck equation
associated to the Itˆo-Langevin Eq. (29) has the form (28). Moreover, the underlying sequences present intermittent
bursts (similar to those exhibited in Fig. 6.b) and, preliminary results indicate the presence of persistent power-law
correlations, as observed in real data sequences.

Eq.

(29) belongs to a larger class of processes with two-fold power-law behavior that can be also suitable for

volumes, as well as, for other mean-reverting variables such as volatilities.

V. FINAL REMARKS

Additive-multiplicative processes are at the core of nonextensive statistical mechanics. In the same natural way that
standard Brownian motion leads to Gaussianity, linear additive-multiplicative stochastic processes lead to q-Gaussian
distributions. Special (scale-invariant) correlations, that forbid convergence to the usual Gauss or L´evy limits, lead
to a new type of statistical distributions. A remarkable feature is that the resulting power-law distributions may have
exponents out of the L´evy range, thus allowing to embrace a larger variety of empirical processes. The presence of
two Gaussian white noises, one either enhanced or reduced by internal information, and another purely exogenous,
represents quite realistic features present in a variety of systems, thus justifying the ubiquity of the probability
distributions associated to such kind of processes. In particular, as we have shown, they allow to model the dynamics
of prizes, volatilities, stock-volumes and other relevant ﬁnancial observables.

Another expression of the mechanism underlying the nonextensive theory is connected to the existence of a ﬂuc-
tuating intensive parameter (or “inverse temperature”) following the ideas that foundate the Beck and Cohen super-
statistics [26]. We have shown that these principles allow an alternative description of the dynamics of stock-volumes.
Furthermore, such kind of mechanism allows an interesting perspective for treating the family of G/ARCH processes.
The fact that the resulting probability density functions can be described in terms of q-Gaussian distributions, pro-
vides a tractable way of dealing with empirical distributions that match the G/ARCH types. Some of the discussions
presented in this review have been done at a mesoscopic scale. The determination, from more microscopic models, of
the parameters used at the mesoscopic scale is certainly welcome.

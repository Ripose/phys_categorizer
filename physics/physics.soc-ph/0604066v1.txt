Abstract

Inspired by the local minority game, we propose a network boolean game and inves-
tigate its dynamical properties on scale-free networks. The system can self-organize
to a stable state with better performance than random choice game, although only
the local information is available to the agent. By introducing the heterogeneity of
local interactions, we ﬁnd the system has the best performance when each agent’s
interaction frequency is linear correlated with its information capacity. Generally,
the agents with more information gain more than those with less information, while
in the optimal case, each agent almost has the same average proﬁt. In addition, we
investigate the role of irrational factor and ﬁnd an interesting symmetrical behavior.

1 Introduction

In recent years, the phenomena of collective behavior related to populations
of interacting individuals attract increasing attentions in the scientiﬁc world,
especially in the economical and biological systems [1,2,3]. To describe and
explain the self-organized phenomenon, many models are established. Inspired

by Arthur’s Farol Bar Problem [4], Challet and Zhang proposed the so-called
minority game (MG) [5,6], which is a simple but rich model showing how selﬁsh
agents ﬁght for common resources in the absence of direct communication.

In the standard minority game, a group of N (odd) agents has to choose
between two opposing actions, which are labelled by +1 and −1 , respectively.
In the real systems of stock market, these options mean to buy stock or to sell.
Each agent is assigned a set of s strategies and informed the updated global
outcomes during the past M time steps. At each time step, they use the most
working strategies to make decisions, and those who end up in the minority
side (the side chosen by fewer agents) win and get a point. Though simple, MG
displays the self-organized global-cooperative behaviors which are ubiquitously
observed in many social and economic systems [7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17].
Furthermore, it can explain a large amount of empirical data and might con-
tribute to the understanding of many-body ecosystems [18,19,20].

In the real world, an individual ia able to get information from his/her ac-
quaintances, and try to perform optimally in his/her immediate surroundings.
In order to add this spatial eﬀect to the basic MG, recently, some authors
introduced the so-called local minority game (LMG), where agent could make
a wiser decision relying on the local information [21,22,23,24,25,26,27]. It is
showed in their works that the system could beneﬁt from the spatial arrange-
ment, and achieves self-organization which is similar to the basic MG.

Denote each agent by a node, and generate a link between each pair of
agents having direct interaction, then the mutual inﬂuence can vividly be
described by means of the information networks. Accordingly, node degree k
is proportional to the quantity of information available to the corresponding
agent. Most LMG models are based on either the regular networks, or the
random ones. Nevertheless, both of them have a characterized degree, the
mean degree hki, which means each agent is almost in the same possession
of information. However, previous studies reveal that the real-life information
networks are highly heterogeneous with approximately power-law distributions
[28,29,30]. Thus the above assumption is quite improper for the reality. In
common sense, those who process huge sources of information always play
active and important roles. Therefore, in this paper, we will study the case on
the base of scale-free networks.

Another interesting issue is the herd behaviors that have been extensively
studied in Behavioral Finance and is usually considered as a crucial origin
of complexity that enhances the ﬂuctuation and reduces the system proﬁt
[32,33,34,35,36,37]. Here we argue that, to measure the potential occurrence
of herd behavior, it is more proper to look at how much an agent’s actions
are determined by others, that is to say, the local interaction strength of
him, rather than how much he wants to be the majority. Since in many real-

2

life cases, no matter how much the agents want to be the minority, the herd
behavior still occurs. To reveal the underlying mechanism of the herd behavior,
three questions are concerned in this paper:

a) Whether agents have diﬀerent responses under the same interaction strength?

b) What are the varying trends of individual proﬁt as the increase of inter-

c) What are the eﬀects of heterogenous distribution of individual herd strength

Furthermore, a fundamental problem in complexity science is how large sys-
tems with only local information available to the agents may become complex
through a self-organized dynamical process [31,38]. In this paper, we will also
discuss this issue based on the present model by detecting the proﬁt-degree
correlations.

on system proﬁt?

2 Model

In the present model, each agent chooses between two opposing actions at
each time step, simpliﬁed as +1 and -1. And the agents in the minority are
rewarded, thus the system proﬁt equals to the number of winners [6,9].At each
time step, each agent x will, at probability px, make a call to one randomly
selected neighbor to ask about this neighbor’s last action, and then decide
to choose the opposing one; or at probability 1 − px, agent x simply inherits
his previous action. Accordingly, in the former case, agent x will choose +1
, where sx

, or choose -1 at the probability
+1
and sx
−1 denote the number of x’s neighbors choosing +1 and -1 in the last
time step, respectively. It is worthwhile to emphasize that the agents do not
know who are the winners in the previous steps since the global information is
not available. This is one of the main distinctions from the previously studied
LMG models.

Take the irrational factor into account [35], each agent may, at a mutation
probability m, choose an opposite action. The mutation probability adds sev-
eral impulsive and unstable ingredients to our model. Just as the saying goes,
‘nothing is ﬁxed in the stone’, actually, people can not consider every poten-
tial possibility that would come out when making a decision. So, it is the case
that we are making the mind at this moment and changing our mind at the
next. To this extent, the introduction of the mutation parameter enriches our
model.

There are three cases for interaction strength distributions.

a) β = 0, each agent of the network shares the same interaction strength p.

b) β > 0, heterogeneity occurs: The greater the degree, the stronger the
interaction strength, that is, hub nodes depend on the local information while
small nodes exhibit relatively independent decision making.

c) β < 0, the heterogeneity is in the opposite situation: The smaller the

The special case with m = 0.01 and β = 0 has been previously studied to

show the eﬀect of degree heterogeneity on the dynamical behaviors [39].

3 Simulation and Analysis

3.1 Self-organized phenomenon

In this paper, all the simulation results are averaged over 100 independent
realizations, and for each realization, the time length is T = 10000 unless
some special statement is addressed. The Barab´asi-Albert (BA) networks with
minimal degree m = 3 are used [40,41]. Initially, each node randomly choose
+1 or −1. In this subsection, we concentrate on the case β = 0 and m = 0.01.

The performance of the system can be measured by the variance σ2 =

Fig. 3. (Color online) The normalized variance as a function of the average inter-

The system performs better than random game when p ∈ (0, 0.2), p ∈ (0, 0.28) and
p ∈ (0, 0.34) for β = −0.25, β = 0 and β = 0.25, respectively.

t=1(At − N/2)2, where At is the number of agents who choose +1 at
time step t, and N denotes the network size [6,9,17]. Clearly, smaller σ2 cor-
responds to more system proﬁt and for the completely random choice game
(random game for short), σ2 = 0.25N. Fig. 1 shows the normalized variance σ2
N
as a function of the average interaction strength p (Since β = 0, all the nodes
have the same interaction strength p). Unexpectedly, although the global in-
formation is unavailable, the system is able to perform better than random
game in the interval p ∈ (0, 0.28). This is a strong evidence for the existence
of self-organized process. In addition, we attain that the network size eﬀect is
very slight for suﬃcient N (N ∼ 103), thus hereinafter, only the case N = 1001
is investigated.

In Fig. 2, we report the agent’s winning rate versus degree, where the winning
rate is denoted by the average score hsi during one time step. Obviously, unless
the two extreme points p = 0 and p = 1, there is a positive correlation between
the agent’s proﬁt and degree, which means the agents of larger degree will
perform better than those of less degree. If the agents choosing +1 and −1 are
equally mixed up in the network, there is no correlation between proﬁt and
degree [39]. Therefore, this positive correlation provides another evidence of

6

the existence of a self-organized process.

3.2 Eﬀect of interaction strength heterogeneity on system proﬁt

In this subsection, we investigate how β aﬀects the system proﬁt with mu-

tation probability m = 0.01 ﬁxed.

In Fig. 3, it is observed that in all the three cases β = −0.25, β = 0, and
β = 0.25, the system performs more eﬃciently than the random choice game
when p is at a certain interval. More interesting, when the interaction strength
p is small (p < 0.5), the system with positive β (β = 0.25) performs best, while
for large p (p > 0.5), the system with negative β (β = −0.25) performs best.
However, this phenomenon does not hold if |β| is too large (β ∼= 1).

We have checked that for all the cases with β ∈ (−1, 1), all the systems
achieve their own optimal state at the interval p ∈ [0.02, 0.1]. When given
p, it is natural to question whether there exists an optimal β, in which the
system performs best. We report the normalized variance as a function of β for
diﬀerent p in ﬁgure 4. Remarkably, all the optimal states are achieved around
β = 1. Besides, it is worthwhile to attach signiﬁcant importance to the case
when β = 1 and p = 0.08, when we have the most proﬁtable system.

The interaction strength heterogeneity can have some positive eﬀects on
system as a whole, including better use of the information and more proﬁt. We
wonder which group of people proﬁt after all? Speciﬁcally, ﬁgure 5 shows the
agent’s winning rate versus degree for β = −0.25, 0 and 1, where p = 0.08 is
ﬁxed. Unexpectedly, in the most optimal system (i.e. β = 1 and p = 0.08), the
proﬁt-degree correlation vanishes. So one may draw an interesting conclusion
that the great disparity between poor and rich population is not the necessary
condition for an eﬃcient social. However, we can not give an analytical solution
about this phenomenon, and the corresponding conclusion may be only valid
for this special model.

3.3 Role of irrational factor

Figure 6 reports the normalized variance as a function of the mutation prob-
ability m. Interestingly, the curves display symmetry with a dividing point
m = 0.5 at which each system has the same proﬁt as the random game. For
arbitrary agent, denote sa the number of this agent’s neighbors choosing a in
the present time step, and p(a,b) the probability he/she will choose b in the
next time step under the condition that he/she chooses a in the present time

m by 1 − m, one will immediately ﬁnd the symmetry.

4 Conclusion

In summary, inspired by the local minority game, we propose a network
boolean game. The simulation results upon the scale-free network are shown.
The system can self-organize to a stable state with a better performance than
random choice game, although only the local information is available to the
agent. This is reasonable evidence of the existence of a self-organized pro-
cess. We ﬁnd remarkable diﬀerences between the case with local interaction
strengths identical for all agents (β = 0), and that with local interaction
strengths unequally distributed to the agents. The interval of p, within which
the system can perform better than random game, is obviously extended in
the case when β > 0. In addition, the system reaches the best performance
when each agent’s interaction frequency is linear correlated with its informa-
tion capacity. Generally, the agents with more information gain more, however,
in the optimal case, each agent has almost the same average proﬁt. Within
the frame of this model, the great disparity between poor and rich population
is not the necessary condition for an eﬃcient social. The eﬀect of irrational
factor on the dynamics of this model is also investigated, and an interesting
symmetrical behavior is found.

Fig. 6. (Color online) The normalized variance as a function of the mutation proba-

exhibit symmetry with a dividing point m = 0.5. When m = 0.5, every system has
the same proﬁt as the random game though diﬀerent p. The shapes of these curves
vary as p increases: For small p, the curves have the peculiar “two-winged” shape,
while for large p, the curves become U-shaped. The cases for p > 0.5 have very large
σ2/N when m is close to 0 or 1, thus not shown here.

Although is rough, the model oﬀers a simple and intuitive paradigm of many-
body systems that can self-organize even when only local information is avail-
able. Since the self-organized process is considered as one of the key ingredients
of the origins of complexity, hopefully, the model as well as its perspectives and
conclusions might contribute to the achievement of the underlying mechanism
of the complex systems.

Set some kinds of action strength correlated with the degree of corresponding
node in a power-law form (e.g. px ∼ kβ
x ) to better the system performance is
not only available in this particular issue, but also a widely used approach for
many dynamics upon scale-free networks, such as to fasten searching engine
[42], to enhance network synchronizability [43], to improve traﬃc capacity [44],
and so on.

Abstract

An intense research on ﬁnancial market microstructure is presently in progress. Continuous time

random walks (CTRWs) are general models capable to capture the small-scale properties that high

frequency data series show. The use of CTRW models in the analysis of ﬁnancial problems is quite

recent and their potentials have not been fully developed. Here we present two (closely related)

applications of great interest in risk control.

In the ﬁrst place, we will review the problem of

modelling the behaviour of the mean exit time (MET) of a process out of a given region of ﬁxed

size. The surveyed stochastic processes are the cumulative returns of asset prices. The link between

the value of the MET and the timescale of the market ﬂuctuations of a certain degree is crystal

clear. In this sense, MET value may help, for instance, in deciding the optimal time horizon for

the investment. The MET is, however, one among the statistics of a distribution of bigger interest:

the survival probability (SP), the likelihood that after some lapse of time a process remains inside

the given region without having crossed its boundaries. The ﬁnal part of the manuscript is devoted

to the study of this quantity. Note that the use of SPs may outperform the standard “Value at

Risk” (VaR) method for two reasons: we can consider other market dynamics than the limited

Wiener process and, even in this case, a risk level derived from the SP will ensure (within the

desired quintile) that the quoted value of the portfolio will not leave the safety zone. We present

some preliminary theoretical and applied results concerning this topic.

INTRODUCTION

The continuous time random walk (CTRW) formalism was introduced four decades ago

by Montroll and Weiss [1], as a natural extension of ordinary random walks (RWs). In a (one

dimensional) RW you can randomly move through a ﬁxed grid either up or down, at regular

time steps, whereas in a CTRW the size of the movements and specially the time lag between

them are random. CTRWs have been successfully applied to a wide and diverse variety of

physical phenomena over the years [2]: transport in random media, random networks, self-

organized criticality, earthquake modelling; and recently also to ﬁnance [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,

10, 11, 12]. In this latter context, the eﬀorts have been mostly focused on the statistical

properties of the waiting time between successive transactions and the asset return at each

transaction. Diﬀerent studies in diﬀerent markets are conceiving the idea that the empirical

distributions of both random variables are compatible with an asymptotic fat tail behaviour

[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].

Within the CTRW formalism we have recently investigated the mean exit time (MET) of

asset prices out of a given region for ﬁnancial time series [11, 12]. In these articles we show

that the MET follows a quadratic growth in terms of the interval width, both in small and

large scales. We checked the persistence of this behaviour in time series from several markets,

such the foreign exchange market, or the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The theoretical

model used in these works was based on two-state chain Markovian processes. This model

is able to both describe the quadratic scaling property observed for the MET and provide a

mechanism that can incorporate asset peculiarities through return autocorrelations.

One of the possible applications of the analysis of the MET in ﬁnance is in the ﬁeld of

risk control. There is a direct link between the value of the mean exit time out of a region,

and the timescale of market ﬂuctuations of a certain size. Therefore, its value may help,

for instance, in deciding the minimal time horizon for an investment, the rotation rate of a

portfolio, or even the value of stop-loss and stop-limit levels for a position.

However, the mean exit time is only a statistic of a distribution with even bigger interest:

the survival probability (SP), the probability that after some elapsed time a process remains

inside the given region without having crossed its boundaries. This quantity may outperform

the standard “Value at Risk” (VaR) method for two reasons: it could be based on market

statistics diﬀerent than the (unrealistic) Gaussian distribution, and it will ensure (within

2

the desired quintile) that the market value of the portfolio will not leave the safe zone.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. II we discuss the MET within the CTRW

formalism, under a meaningful set of simplifying assumptions. In Sect. III we relax some of

the previous constrains in order to introduce some memory into the process. Section IV is

devoted to the SP, its properties and its connections with the MET. In Sect. V we show in

a practical situation how SP can be used in risk control. Conclusions are drawn in Sect. VI.

II. EXTREME EVENTS WITHIN CTRW

In the most common version of the CTRW formalism a given random process X(t)

, tn,
shows a series of random increments or jumps at random times
remaining constant between these jumps. Therefore, after a given time interval τn = tn−
the process experiences a random increment ∆Xn(τn) = X(tn)

, t−1, t0, t1, t2,

X(tn−1) and the resulting

· · ·
tn−1,

· · ·

· · ·

trajectory consists of a series of steps as shown in Fig. 1. Waiting times τn and random jumps

∆Xn(τn) are described by their probability density functions (pdfs) which we will denote by

ψ(τ ) and h(x) respectively. We refer the reader to Refs. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] for a

more complete account of the CTRW formalism.

In the present work we will show two applications of CTRWs to the study of extreme

problems in ﬁnancial time series. We will take as underlying random process X(t) the

logarithmic price X(tn) = ln(S(tn)), where S(t) is the stock price at time t. We ﬁrst

consider the problem of obtaining the mean exit time of X(t) out of a given interval [a, b],

of width L. We assume that at certain reference time t0, right after an event, the price has
a known value X(t0) = x0, x0 ∈
of the process and suppose that at certain time tn > t0 the process ﬁrst leaves the interval
—see Fig. 1. We call the lapse tn −
denote it by t[a,b](x0). This quantity is a random variable since it depends on the particular

[a, b]. Let us focus our attention on a particular realization

t0, the exit time out of the region [a, b] and we will

trajectory of X(t) chosen and the MET is simply the average T[a,b](x0) = E[t[a,b](x0)].

The standard approach to exit time problems is based on the knowledge of the survival

probability —see Sect. IV. In general, this is a quite involved path [13]. However, if we

assume that τn and ∆Xn(τn) are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random

variables, described by a joint pdf ρ(x, τ ),

ρ(x, τ )dxdτ = Prob

it can be shown [11] that one can obtain the MET directly, without making use of the survival

probability. In this framework the MET T[a,b](x0) obeys the following integral equation:

T[a,b](x0) = E[τ ] +

h(x

x0)T[a,b](x)dx,

where E[τ ] is the mean waiting time between jumps. It is worth noticing that Eq. (1) is still

valid even when τn and ∆Xn are cross-correlated. In fact, in the case of an i.i.d. process

the MET only depends on ρ(x, τ ) through its marginal pdfs ψ(τ ) and h(x).

We can illustrate the problem with a choice for h(x), based on the small-scale properties

of the system, which results in the observed [11, 12] quadratic growth in the MET. Let us

introduce the following symmetrical two-state discrete model [12]:

h(x) =

[δ(x

c) + δ(x + c)] .

(2)

where c is the basic jump size. This choice for h(x) implies that the ﬂat levels in every

particular trajectory will be in a regular grid of size c centred at the starting point x0. It is

1

worth noticing that this approach is also used in the context of option pricing, when the fair

price of a derivative product is obtained by making use of the binomial trees methodology,

where it is assumed that the stock price makes a jump up or down with some probability [14].

The solution of this problem, if we start from the middle of the interval, reads:

In order to embrace also CTRWs with memory, we derived in [12] an integral equation for

the MET when the jumps are Markovian. In particular, we focused on the case in which it

is possible to neglect the inﬂuence of the past waiting time by assuming that the magnitude

of the previous change carries all the relevant information. The equation in this case is:

∆X0) = E [τ

T[a,b](x0|

explicit expressions for the MET we will use again a discrete two-state model:

IV. THE SURVIVAL PROBABILITY

The survival probability is closely related to the MET as we will shortly show. It measures

the likelihood that, up to time t, the process has been always in the interval [a, b]:

S[a,b](t

t0; x0)

−

P

a
{

≤

≡

X(t)

b, M(t)

b, m(t)

≤

≤

|

X(t0) = x0}

,

≥

where we have deﬁned the maximum and the minimum value of X(t), M(t) and m(t), by:

M(t) = max
t0≤t′≤t

X(t′) , and m(t) = min
t0≤t′≤t

X(t′).

The ﬁnancial interest of SP is clear: it may be very useful in risk control. Note, for instance,

the case b

. The SP measures, not only the probability that you do not loose more

→ ∞

than a at the end of your investment horizon, like VaR, but also in any previous instant.

It is notorious that we can recover the MET from the Laplace Transform of the SP. If fact,

as we have stated above, this is the standard technique used in the literature for obtaining

METs. The link between both magnitudes becomes apparent if we express the MET in

terms of P

t[a,b] ≤

{

, the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of the exit time:

Now, we must realize that the only way that t[a,b] can be bigger than any given value is that

the process has been inside the interval up to that time:

and therefore,

T[a,b](x0) =

It is not surprising that the survival probability follows a renewal equation when also the

mean exit time can be expressed in such a way —see for instance Ref. [15]. In the present

case, where we consider that the process properties are depending, at most, on the size of

last the jump, we can derive the following two-dimensional integral equation for the SP:

The problem of the two-state discrete model without memory, Eq. (2), is aﬀordable but

the complexity of the solution casts few light into the general understanding of the issue.

Therefore, we have left it for a forthcoming work, and we have focused our attention on the

symmetric exponential case, Eq. (4), which gave similar results for the MET —cf Eqs. (3)

and (5). This model is very suitable for our purposes because reduces the problem from

solving an integral equation to ﬁnding the solution of a second-order (ordinary) diﬀerential

equation:

with the following boundary conditions:

where the volatility σ is the square root of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient. The two formulas coincide

for small values of the Laplace variable s, that is, for large timescales. The resemblance

between both models when the interval width is bounded is not so evident, because in the

Wiener case the SP can be only expressed in terms of an expansion series:

In any case, it is easy to check that the long-term behaviour of the MET is similar:

V. RISK CONTROL

We will ﬁnally illustrate how SPs can be used in risk control.

In order to clarify the

concepts we will remove model-dependant inferences by using the outcome corresponding to

the Wiener case. The Gaussian model is typically used for computing the “Value of Risk”

(VaR) level. VaR gives the worst return you can obtain at the end of a ﬁxed time interval

t0, for a given conﬁdence level α. If we assume that the market volatility is σ, then

that investors may not assume all the paths leading to the same ﬁnal return.

This will not be the case if we use SP for quantifying the risk, since it will ensure, within

the desired level of conﬁdence, that the position is never below the risk measure, which we

VI. CONCLUSIONS

We have argued for the convenience of the use of CTRWs in the modelling of stochastic

processes in ﬁnance. CTRW is a well suited tool for representing market changes at very low

scales, within the realm of high frequency data. We have shown that this formalism allows

a thorough description of extreme events under a very general setting: we have obtained

9

renewal integral equations for magnitudes related to these events when the return can be

described by either an independent or a Makovian process. We have revisited the properties

of the MET, a statistic that can inform about investment horizons. In previous works we

found that it seems to scale in a similar way for diﬀerent assets. We have addressed the topic

of the SP in ﬁnance afterwards. SP has even more severe implications in risk management.

SpR can improve the eﬃciency of more traditional methods, like VaR. We have introduced

new theoretical results on this issue, and shown a practical example of its application.

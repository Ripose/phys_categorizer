We study the statistical properties of the sampled networks by a random walker. We compare
topological properties of the sampled networks such as degree distribution, degree-degree correlation,
and clustering coeﬃcient with those of the original networks. From the numerical results, we ﬁnd
that most of topological properties of the sampled networks are almost the same as those of the
original networks for γ . 3.
In contrast, we ﬁnd that the degree distribution exponent of the
sampled networks for γ > 3 somewhat deviates from that of the original networks when the ratio of
the sampled network size to the original network size becomes smaller. We also apply the sampling
method to various real networks such as collaboration of movie actor, world wide web, and peer-to-
peer networks. All topological properties of the sampled networks show the essentially same as the
original real networks.

Since the concept of complex network [1] came into the
limelight, many physically meaningful analyses for the
complex networks in real world have emerged. The ex-
amples of such studies include the protein-protein inter-
action networks (PIN) [2], world wide web (WWW) [3],
email network [4], etc. The empirical data or the informa-
tion of the real networks can be collected in various ways,
for example, the traceroutes for the Internet [5] and high
throughput experiments for protein interaction map [6].
Thus, it is natural assumption that the empirical data
can be incomplete due to various reasons which include
some limitations of the experiments and experimental er-
rors or biases. As a result, many real networks which
have been intensively studied so far can be regarded as
sampled networks. Moreover, several studies have shown
that the dynamical properties on the networks can be
signiﬁcantly aﬀected by the underlying topology [7, 8].
Therefore, it is very important and interesting to study
the topological diﬀerences between the sampled networks
and the whole networks.

Recently, several sampling methods such as random
node sampling [9, 10], random link sampling, and snow-
ball sampling were studied [10]. The random node sam-
pling is the simplest method in which the sampled net-
work consists of randomly selected nodes with a given
probability p and the original links between the selected
nodes. On the other hands, in the random link sampling,
the links are randomly selected and the nodes connected
to the selected links are kept. These two random sam-
pling methods have been used to study the statistical
survey in some social networks. In the random sampling
method, however, many important nodes such as hubs
cannot be sampled due to the even selection probability.
Some recent studies show that some networks such as
PIN, the topological properties of randomly sampled net-

works signiﬁcantly deviate from those of the original net-
works [9, 10]. The idea of the snowball sampling method
[10, 11] is similar to the breath-ﬁrst search algorithm
[12, 13]. In the snowball sampling method all the nodes
directly connected to the randomly chosen starting node
are selected. Then all the nodes linked to those selected
nodes in the last step are selected hierarchically. This
process continues until the sampled network has the de-
sired number of nodes [10]. Previous studies showed that
the topological properties of the sampled networks closely
depend on the sampling methods [10].

In this paper, we focus on the eﬀect of the weighted
sampling on the topological properties of sampled net-
works. In order to assign nontrivial weight to each node,
we ﬁrst note the structure of the real networks. Many
real networks are known to be the scale-free networks in
which the degree distribution follows the power-law [1],

Moreover, the probability pv(k) that a random walker
(RW) visits a node of degree k [7] is given by

P (k) ∼ k−γ .

pv(k) ∼ k .

(1)

(2)

The degree k causes uneven probability of ﬁnding a node
by a RW on the heterogeneous networks. Thus, by us-
ing the RW for sampling we can assign automatically
the nontrivial weight to each node which is proportional
to the degree of the node. Due to the uneven visiting
probability, the nodes having the large degree, i.e., topo-
logically important parts, can be easily found regardless
of the starting position of the RW. Therefore, we expect
that the sampling by the RW can provide more eﬀective
way to obtain the sub-networks which have almost the
same statistical properties as the original one. Further-
more, we also study the eﬀects of the heterogeneity of the
original networks on the RW sampling method (RWSM)
by changing γ. This weighted sampling method is also
shown to be successfully applied to obtain the important
informations of many real networks such as actor net-

works, WWW, and peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. There-
fore, we expect that this study can provide a better in-
sight to understand important properties of the real net-
works and oﬀer a systematic approach to the sampling of
networks with various γ.

We now introduce the RWSM. First, we generate orig-
nal scale-free networks (SFN) by use of the static model
in Ref.
[14] from which various sizes of sub-networks
are sampled. The size or number No of nodes of the
original network with each γ is set to be No = 106.
The typical values of γ used in the simulations are
γ = 2.23, 2.51, 3.05, 3.40, and 4.2. We set the average
degree hki = 4 for each network. After the preparation
of original networks, a RW is placed at a randomly chosen
node and moves until it visits Ns distinct nodes. Then
we construct sub-networks with these Ns visited nodes
and the links which connect any pair of nodes among
the Ns visited nodes in the original network. We use
Ns = 103, 104, 2 × 104, 4 × 104, 6 × 104, 8 × 104, 105, and
1, 2, 3, · · · , 9 × 105.

The degree distribution is one of the most important
measure for the heterogeneity of networks [1].
In Fig.
1, we compare the degree distributions of the sampled
networks to those of the original networks for various
γ. We ﬁnd that the degree distribution of the sampled
network also satisﬁes the power-law, P (k) ∼ k−γs.

Especially, from the data in Figs. 1 (a)-(d) we ﬁnd
that the γs of the sampled networks with Ns/No ≥ 0.01
is nearly equal to γ of the original network, even though
the γs for the small Ns has relatively larger error bar. It
shows that the sampling method by RW does not change
the heterogeneity in degree for networks with 2 < γ . 3.
Since most of the real networks have 2 < γ < 3 [1],
this result is practically important. We summarize the
obtained γs’s for various Ns’s and γ’s in Table I.

In contrast to the case γ . 3, γs for γ > 3 slightly
deviates from the γ of the original networks if Ns/No .
0.1. (See the data for γ = 4.2 in Figs. 1 (e) and (f) or in
Table I.) Numerically we ﬁnd that γs is nearly equal to
the original γ for Ns/No > 0.1 when γ . 4.2. Of course
one can expect the substantial deviation of γs from γ as
γ increases further from γ = 4.2.

This γ dependent behavior of P (k) can be understood
from Eqs. (1) and (2). Equation (1) indicates that hk2i
diverges with ﬁnite hki for γ ≤ 3. This implies that the
topology of a network has several dominant hubs which
have extraordinary large number of degrees when γ <
3. Since the probability of visitation of the RW follows
Eq.
(2), the RW can more eﬀectively ﬁnd the central
part of the network around the hubs when γ < 3. Thus
the sampled networks can inherit easily the topological
properties of the original networks.

RWSM is also applied to real networks.

In Fig. 2,
we show the P (k) of the actor network [15], the WWW
[3], and the P2P networks (Gnutella) [16]. The num-
ber of nodes in the original real networks are No =
392340, 325729, and 1074843 for the actor network, the
WWW, and the Gnutella, respectively. The degree dis-

tributions for the actor network and the WWW follow
the power-law with γ = 2.2 (actor) [15] and γ = 2.6
(WWW) [3]. The data in Fig. 2 (a) shows that P (k)
of the sampled actor network follows the power-law with
γs = 2.15 for Ns > 103. This value of γs is quite close to
γ = 2.2. In contrast γs seems to deviate from γ of the
original network for small Ns(= 103). However, the de-
gree exponent γs for Ns = 103 still has almost the same
value with that of the original network over one decade
(k = 10 ∼ 100). In the case of the WWW, the γs of the
sampled networks well agrees with γ ≃ 2.6 even for small
Ns(= 103) (see Fig. 2(b)). For the Gnutella, P (k) of the
original network does not follow the simple power-law
(1). However, as one can see in Fig. 2 (c), the Gnutella
network also has big hubs which cause high heterogene-
ity in degree, and the sampled networks nearly show the
same degree distribution as the original one. These re-
sults also provide the evidence that the nodes with large
degrees play an important role in the RWSM.

namical properties of RWs on complex networks. In the
networks showing disassortative mixing, the RW on a hub
should go through a node of small k to move to another
hub. Thus, many nodes having small k can be connected
to the hubs in the sampled networks and the sampled net-
works remain disassortative. If the networks have neutral
degree correlation, then the networks sampled by the RW
also show neutral degree correlation. (See Figs. 3 (b) and
(c).) In Figs. 3 (d)-(f), we plot hknn(k)i of real networks.
hknn(k)i’s of the sampled networks show the same degree
correlations as those of the original networks. As shown
in Figs. 3 (d)-(f), the degree correlations are assorta-
tive, disassortative, and neutral for the actor, WWW,
and Gnutella networks, respectively.

logical properties of the complex network is the degree-
degree correlation. Many interesting topological proper-
ties such as the self-similarity [17] can be aﬀected by the
degree-degree correlation. The degree-degree correlation
can be characterized by hknn(k)i, the average degree of
the nearest-neighbors of nodes with degree k [18, 19]. If
the hknn(k)i increases (decreases), the network is charac-
terized as assortative (disassortative) mixing. As shown
in Fig. 3 (a), for the static SFN with 2 < γ < 3 the
original network and the sampled networks all show the
disassortative mixing. This can be explained by the dy-

We study the topological properties of sampled net-
works by RWSM with SFN and several real networks.
From the numerical simulations, we ﬁnd that the P (k) of
the sampled network follows the power-law, P (k) ∼ k−γs.
We also ﬁnd that the γs ≃ γ for all Ns when 2 < γ . 3.
Even though γs somewhat increases as decreasing Ns for
γ > 3, the γs’s with Ns/No & 0.1 still follow the origi-
nal one. We also study the degree-degree correlation and
clustering coeﬃcient by measuring hknn(k)i and C(k).
The sampled networks have the same degree correlation
and modular structure with the original networks for all
values of γ. The RWSM is also applied to the actor,
WWW, and Gnutella networks. By measuring P (k),
hknn(k)i, and C(k), we conﬁrm that the topological prop-
erties of the sampled networks are well maintained after
sampling and the RWSM is eﬃcient sampling method for
the real networks.

The γ dependent behavior of the sampled networks
can be understood from the dynamical property of a
RW. Since most of the networks in the real world have
2 < γ < 3, the results imply very important meaning
in practice. Based on our results, we expect that if we
obtain the empirical data by weighted sampling in which
the weight is proportional to the degree, then the sam-
pled networks can share the same topological properties
with the whole network. Especially, the weighted sam-
pling method becomes very eﬃcient as the heterogeneity
of networks increases. At the same time, we also expect
that our study can provide a systematic way to extract
sub-networks from the empirical data and to study vari-
ous dynamical properties of the real networks [21].

of node i’s neighbors. Ci is one if all neighbors are com-
pletely connected, whereas Ci becomes zero on a inﬁnite-
sized random network [1].

In Fig.

4, we plot the clustering coeﬃcient C(k)
against degree k. C(k) is known to reﬂect the modu-
lar structure of networks [18, 20]. C(k) does not depend
on k if the network does not have any well deﬁned hi-
erarchical modules [18, 20]. As shown in Fig. 4, C(k)
of both the original networks and the sampled networks
shows a tendency to decrease with increasing k for SFN
with γ = 2.23 and real networks. (See Figs. 4 (a) and
(d)-(f)). This implies that the sampled networks have
the same modular structure with original networks. On
the other hand, the topology of networks with γ ≫ 3
resembles closely the random graph, thus C(k) does not
depend on the degree k [20]. The dependence of C(k)
on k for the sampled SFNs with γ ≥ 3 is also nearly the
same as the original SFNs. (See Figs. 4 (b) and (c).)

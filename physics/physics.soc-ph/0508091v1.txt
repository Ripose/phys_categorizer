Abstract. Most communication networks are complex. In this paper, we address one of the fundamental
problems we are facing nowadays, namely, how we can eﬃciently protect these networks. To this end, we
study an immunization strategy and found that it works as good as targeted immunization, but using
only local information about the network topology. Our ﬁndings are supported with numerical simulations
of the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model on top of real communication networks, where immune
nodes are previously identiﬁed by a covering algorithm. The results provide useful hints in the way to
design and deploying a digital immune system.

1 Introduction

Communications networks have been intensively studied
during the last several years as it turned out that their
topology is far from being random [1,2,3,4]. In particular,
it has been found that physical networks −the Internet−
as well as logical− the World Wide Web− and peer-to-
peer networks −Gnutella− are characterized by a power
law degree distribution [4] (thus, they are referred to as
scale-free networks [5,6]), P (k) ∼ k−γ, where the degree
or connectivity k of a node is the number of nodes it is at-
tached to. These ﬁndings, together with similar network
structures found in ﬁelds as diverse as biological, social
and natural systems [7,8,9], have led to a burst of activ-
ity aimed at characterizing the structure and dynamics of
complex networks.

The spreading of an epidemic disease in complex net-
works was among the relevant problems that were ﬁrst ad-
dressed in the literature [10,11]. Surprisingly, it was found
that for inﬁnite scale-free networks with 2 < γ < 3, the
epidemic always pervades the system no matter what the
spreading rate is [10,11,12,13], even when correlations are
taken into account [14,15,16]. In other words, the usual
threshold picture does not apply anymore. This fact would
be a mere anecdote if not because most vaccination and
public health campaigns are based on the existence of such
a threshold [17]. In practice, it would be desirable to have
a threshold as large as possible for a given epidemic dis-
ease.

Soon after the ﬁrst studies on epidemic spreading, it
was realized that traditional vaccination strategies based

on random immunization, while worth taking for random
network topologies, were useless in scale-free networks[18].
Speciﬁcally, it was shown that a minimum fraction as large
as 80% of the nodes has to be immunized in order to re-
cover the epidemic threshold. New vaccination strategies
are thus needed in order to eﬃciently deal with the actual
topology of real-world networks. A very eﬃcient approach
consist of vaccinating the highly connected nodes in or-
der to cut the path through which most of the susceptible
nodes catch the epidemics [18,19]. However, in order to
do that, one has to identify the core groups or hubs of the
system. In general this is extremely unrealistic, particu-
larly for large networks and systems lacking organizative
rules such as social networks.

In this paper, we consider the immunization problem
from a diﬀerent perspective. We show that it can be treated
as a covering problem, in which a set of immune agents has
to be placed somewhere in the network. The main advan-
tage of this approach is that only local topological knowl-
edge is needed up to a given distance d, so that it can be
straightforwardly applied to a real situation. To verify the
results of the immunization strategy, we implement the
Susceptible-Infected-Removed epidemiological model [12,
13] on top of the Internet maps at the Autonomous Sys-
tems (AS) and router levels and compare with the results
obtained by using targeted and random immunization as
well as a local immunization strategy. Our results indicate
that the algorithm performs quite well and is near the op-
timal one. On the other hand, we show that the eﬃciency
of the vaccination strongly depends on the degree-degree
correlations as the number of immune nodes and their dis-

In order to be able to compare the eﬃciency of the dif-
ferent immunization strategies, we ﬁrst perform extensive
numerical simulations of an epidemic spreading process on
top of real architectures (here, epidemics refers to any un-
desired process, i.e, virus, spam, etc spreading). We con-
sider the SIR model as a plausible model for epidemic
spreading [17,12]. In this model, nodes can be in three
diﬀerent states. Susceptible nodes, S, have not been in-
fected and are healthy. They catch the disease via direct
contact with infected nodes, I, at a rate λ. Finally, re-
covered nodes, R, are those nodes that have caught the
disease and have stopped spreading it with probability β
(without loss of generality, β has been set to 1 henceforth).
The relevant order parameter of the disease dynamics is
the total number of nodes (or the fraction of them, R)
that got infected once the epidemic process dies out, i.e.,
when no infected nodes are left in the system.

On the other hand, the simulations performed through-
out this work have been carried out on real communica-
tion networks. The fact that any study thought to have
practical applications should be tested in real systems led
us to such an election. These networks have unique topo-
logical properties diﬃcult to gather with existing generic
network models − namely, degree-degree correlations and
clustering properties. The networks on top of which nu-
merical simulations of the immunization strategies and
the SIR dynamics have been performed are the follow-

shot of the Gnutella peer to peer network, provided by

graph representation of the Internet. The three networks
are sparse and show an average degree around 3. Addi-
tionally, they are small-worlds [22] with an average dis-
tance between vertices less than 10, and they are charac-
terized by a power law degree distribution P (k) ∼ k−γ,
with γ ≈ 2.2. A detailed characterization of these graphs
is presented in Refs. [23] (Gnutella) and [2,24,4] (AS and
Router graphs).

These networks share a number of topological features
but diﬀer in their degree-degree correlations. Correlations
are usually deﬁned taken into account the degrees of nearest-
neighbors. We have recently shown [20], however, that
whether a network can be regarded as assortative − when
correlations are positive, i.e., there is a tendency to estab-
lish connections between vertices with similar degrees −
or disassortative − negative correlations, the tendency is
the opposite − depends on the distance used to average
the degrees of the neighboring vertices. In this way, the AS
and the Gnutella graphs show dissortative correlations for
any value of d, though the correlations are smoothed as
d grows. On the other hand, in the Router network, the

degree correlations are assortative up to d = 2, becom-
ing disassortative for d > 2 and following a similar trend
than in the original disassortative networks for d > 6 [20].
These peculiar properties directly aﬀect the outcome of
algorithms run on top of these networks.

In the following, we focus on the results obtained for
the AS’s and router maps of the Internet. The behavior of
both the epidemic spreading process and the immuniza-
tion strategies for the Gnutella graph are qualitatively the
same as for the AS map, with the only diﬀerence of more
pronounced ﬁnite-size eﬀects.

We have performed Monte Carlo simulations of the
SIR model on top of the Internet maps. Starting from an
initial state in which a randomly chosen node is infected,
susceptible nodes catch the disease (or virus) with prob-
ability λ if they contact a spreader. In its turn, infected
vertices become removed and do not take part anymore
in the spreading process at a rate β = 1. The fraction
of removed nodes, R, when no spreaders are left in the
system gives the epidemic incidence. All results have been
averaged over at least 1000 realizations corresponding to
diﬀerent initially infected nodes. Figure 1 shows the epi-

Fig. 2. Comparison of the immunization strategies for the
Internet AS map. In the ﬁgure, we have represented the ra-
tio between the epidemic incidence of the four immunization
strategies considered (R) and that of the original system with-
out immunization (RSIR) for diﬀerent values of hxi. The legend
refers to the following immunization strategies: the one intro-
duced in this paper (local), targeted immunization (Kmax),
random immunization (random) and single acquaintance im-
munization (SAI). In this case, 1% of the non-immune nodes
were initially infected at random. See the text for further de-
tails. The distances considered in the local algorithm are: (a)

demic incidence in the AS and router maps of the Internet
as a function of the spreading rate λ.

As can be seen from the ﬁgure, the epidemic threshold
is slightly larger in the router graph than in the network
made up of AS’s. This diﬀerence in the behavior of the SIR
model on diﬀerent representations of the Internet may be
understood from the distinct degree-degree correlations
shown by both graphs. In the AS map representation,
highly connected nodes are likely connected to nodes with
smaller degrees. Therefore, the spreading process gener-
ally passes alternatively from highly to poorly connected
nodes. In this way, the epidemics has more chances to
reach a number of nodes other than the hubs. This is not
the case of the Router map, where it is more likely that
hubs are grouped together and that once one of them got
infected, its neighbors (also highly connected nodes) do
so. However, when the epidemics leaves the hubs, the re-
maining (uninfected) nodes are, likely, poorly connected
and with high probability the process will die out, spe-
cially for small values of λ ∼ λc. That is, in the router
map, the epidemic reaches the hubs, but then goes down
to nodes of decreasing degree and stops soon afterwards,
resulting in a smaller fraction of infected nodes (the hubs
and a few more, i.e, a tiny fraction of the network) and
thus to an eﬀective threshold that is larger than that for
the AS.

In order to check this hypothesis, we have also rep-
resented in Fig. 1 the results of a targeted immunization
strategy for both networks and diﬀerent percentages of
immune nodes. In targeted immunization, a fraction of

highly connected nodes are immunized (i.e., do not get
infected) in decreasing order of their degrees. In the event
that there are left l immune nodes to be distributed within
a connectivity class k containing j > l nodes, the l immune
nodes are randomly distributed within k and the results
are averaged over at least 100 additional realizations of
this procedure. The results depicted in the ﬁgure conﬁrms
that the degree-degree correlations play an important role
in the performance of the immunization policy. It is more
eﬃcient for the AS network, particularly beyond a rela-
tive small fraction of immune nodes around 5%. This is,
as before, due to the fact that highly connected nodes
are more distributed over the network while in the router
graph representation highly connected nodes, hence those
immune, are topologically closer to each other and the epi-
demics can propagate through larger parts of the network
ﬁnally leading to a smaller eﬀective value for the epidemic
threshold. That is, in the AS representation, targeted im-
munization is more eﬀective because immune nodes cut
the paths leading to poorly connected nodes, the more
abundant, i.e., network disruption (as far as the lack of
a giant component of non-immune nodes is concerned)
appears ﬁrst. These diﬀerences will become more appar-
ent later on when local immunization strategies come into
play.

3 Immunization Strategies

Let us now summarize the local immunization strategy in-
troduced in this work. The allocation of network resources
to satisfy a given service with the least use of resources,
is a frequent problem in communication networks. In our
case, we would like to have a robust system in front of
a disease or virus spreading process but saving resources,
that is, using the minimum number of immune nodes. This
is a highly topical problem in communication networks as
it might lead to the developing and deploying of a digi-
tal immune system to prevent technological networks from
virus spreading. Recently [20], we have studied a general
covering problem in which every vertex is covered or has
at least one covered node at a distance at most d. In what
follows, we show that the set of covered vertices C can be
taken as the set of nodes to be immunized.

The heuristic algorithm proceeds as follows [20]: For
every vertex i in the network, look for the vertex with
the highest degree within a distance d of i and immu-
nize it. In case there is more than one vertex with the
highest degree, one of them is selected at random and
immunized. Moreover, if there is already an immune ver-
tex within the neighborhood of i, that immunization is
kept. We have shown before [20] that this local algorithm
gives near-optimal solutions for a general distance-d cov-
ering problem, though the result of the covering depends
on topological features such as the degree-degree correla-
tions.

The immunization strategy here considered assumes
that covered vertices are immune nodes to the spreading
of a disease or virus. For instance, in a technological net-
work, they could be thought of as being special devices

devoted to ﬁltering out any virus or attack. This would
imply that the spreading process stops when it arrives to
such nodes. This is of course the ideal situation. However,
it happens more often that immune nodes can not catch
the epidemic, but they are not able to stop spreading it
through other nodes − as when you have an up-to-date
antivirus. Therefore, we study the worse scenario and con-
sider that immunized nodes just repel the virus cutting the
path to infection spreading.

The approach presented here is in the spirit of the im-
munization strategy proposed by Cohen et al.[21]. Since
the immunization algorithm is local, one only needs in-
formation about the neighbors of a given node up to a
distance d. This information is usually available for small
values of d and easy to gather, in sharp contrast to tar-
geted immunization that requires complete knowledge of
the degree distribution [18,19]. The diﬀerence between our
approach and that in [21] is that we look for the highly
connected nodes in small parts of the network, while the
strategy developed in [21] is based on the fact that ran-
domly selected acquaintances likely have larger connectiv-
ities than randomly choosen nodes. Thus, in general, we
expect our strategy to perform better than that proposed
in [21], while keeping the local character of the algorithm
[25]. On the other hand, either the number of immune
nodes or the distance d, which is a measure of the degree of
local knowledge of the network topology, should be ﬁxed.
This makes the algorithm more parameter-constrained,
but allows a more eﬃcient distribution of resources.

We have performed extensive numerical simulations
of four diﬀerent immunization schemes. The immuniza-
tion obtained following the covering algorithm ﬁxes the
fraction, hxi, of immune nodes in the whole network for
each value of d. Random immunization means that a frac-
tion hxi of immune nodes is randomly placed on the net-
works. Targetted immunization looks for the hxiN highly
connected nodes and immunizes them. Finally, the Single
Acquaintance Immunization (SAI) algorithm proposed in

[21] is run taking p = hxi and ensuring that the total num-
ber of immune nodes is the same in both schemes. In all
cases, the results are averaged over many realizations for
each value of λ and hxi. The results are displayed in Fig.
2 and Fig. 3.

As expected, targeted immunization produces the best
results for both topologies. Note that, as discussed in the
previous section, the performance of the algorithm de-
pends on the correlations and produces diﬀerent results
for AS and router maps. On the other extreme we ﬁnd ran-
dom immunization, whose performance is not aﬀected by
the degree-degree correlations of the underlying networks.
Turning our attention to local algorithms, it is found that
the immunization scheme based on the covering algorithm
performs better than the SAI, even for small values of d,
where it is truly local. In fact, it is outperformed only by
the targeted procedure and for all values of the parame-
ters d and λ lies between the most eﬃcient and the SAI
scheme. Additionally, from a practical point of view, the
covering strategy could be a good policy since it balances
the degree of local knowledge and the eﬃciency of the
vaccination. Moreover, as all network topologies are not
neither completely known nor completely unknown, the
covering allows to ﬁne-tune the value of d on a case-by-case
base and thus it is more ﬂexible than other immunization
strategies (recall that it is the result of an optimization).
We have further explored the diﬀerences between the
global and covering-based immunization schemes. In prin-
ciple, one may think that as we are immunizing highly
connected nodes, both strategies produce the same set of
immune nodes. Obviously, this is not the case since the
covering performs at shorter distances than targeted im-
munization. In fact, a direct comparison of who the im-
mune nodes are in both algorithms shows that no more
than 50% of them are the same and both sets equal only
when d reaches the diameter of the network. Moreover, as
a further evidence of the inﬂuence of the graph represen-
tation in the performance of immunization schemes, it is
found that for the router level the percentage above can
increase up to 70%.

Let us now restrict our discussion to the local (cover-
ing) immunization scheme and focus on the inﬂuence of
degree-degree correlations on the ﬁnal size of the outbreak.
Figures 4 and 5 reﬂect the diﬀerences in the algorithm’s
performance for the AS and the Router maps of Internet.
Figure 4 illustrates the relative diﬀerence of the epidemic
incidence as a function of d, taking as a reference the size
of the outbreak at d = 1. The behavior depicted in the
ﬁgure is quite similar to the dependency of the number of
nodes covered by each immune node, hni, when d is in-
creased [20]. For the AS network, the fraction of infected
nodes at the end of the epidemic spreading process rapidly
increases. In contrast, the increase in the epidemic inci-
dence for the router network takes place at larger values
of d. This indicates that for the same d > 1, the immuniza-
tion strategy works better at the router level as conﬁrmed
in Fig. 5, top panel. The reason of this behavior becomes
apparent by noticing that for the router level hxi is bigger
than for the AS, but the number hni of nodes “covered” on

On the contrary, when the nodes covered by each immune ver-
tex hni is (roughly) the same, inmunization works better in
A.S. (hni = 0 for d = 1; hni ≃ 0.2 for d = 2 in A.S. and

average by each immune node is smaller. The combination
of the two factors leads to a more eﬃcient immunization
at the router level, however, at the cost of more resources.
Both strategies tend to be closer as d is increased because
at the router level the correlations change beyond d > 2.
The previous result has to be carefully interpreted and
should not be misunderstood. A closer look at the inﬂu-
ence of the correlations reveals that, although in general

they determine hxi and hni for each map, these two quan-
tities alone do not suﬃce to explain all the diﬀerences
observed. Indeed, the local structure of the network turns
out to be at the root of the immunization eﬃciency and
the optimal trade-oﬀ between the size of the outbreak and
the least use of resources. To see this, we have analyzed
the situation in which both hxi (though d are diﬀerent)
and hni are the same in the two representations. This
case is represented in the bottom panel of Fig. 5. As can
be seen from the ﬁgure, in the latter case, the immuniza-
tion scheme for the AS outperforms that for the router
level. This behavior is due to the fact that in the AS net-
work, the immune nodes are more distributed throughout
the network because highly connected vertices alternate
with poorly connected ones. On the contrary, at the router
level, the hubs are topologically closer to each other (the
correlations are positive) and thus some of the immune
nodes are not highly connected resulting in a less eﬃcient
protection in front of an epidemic.

4 Discussion and Conclusions

In this paper, we have analyzed the spreading of an epi-
demic disease on top of real complex communication net-
works both with and without immunization. First, we have
shown that targeted immunization produces diﬀerent re-
sults depending on the local properties of the underlying
graph by using diﬀerent representations of the same tech-
nological network, the Internet. Later, we turned our at-
tention to several immunization strategies and proposed a
scheme that is neither completely local nor global, but can
be tuned between the two extremes. The strategy intro-
duced has been shown to perform better than all previous
methods irrespective of the degree of local knowledge, ex-
cept for the case of targeted immunization.

An important part of the work has dealt with the in-
ﬂuence of degree-degree correlations on the performance
of all vaccination algorithms. To this respect, it has been
shown that local propeties are extremely important for
the outcome of a given strategy. Moreover, the work pre-
sented here has been performed on top of real networks,
an thus the results are of high practical interest. An added
value of the method developed here is that the covering-
based strategy does not only deal with the degree of the
immune nodes, as all previous schemes do, but naturally
introduces the practical constraint of having limited re-
sources to be distributed in the system on top of which
the epidemics is spreading. Therefore, our method and the
results found can shed light and provide useful hints in the
search of optimal immunization strategies as the develop-
ment and deploying of a digital immune system, a highly
topical issue nowadays.

Finally, it is worth mentioning here that although we
have not analyzed the case here, it would also be pos-
sible to develop an even more ﬂexible strategy in which
the immunization through the covering algorithm is done
with a variable d for the same network, that is, one can
implement an algorithm that optimize hxi locally for dif-
ferent neighborhoods (i.e., diﬀerent values of d for each

nor global. In fact, by tuning the distance d of the immu-

our work points to a new direction in designing immuniza-
tion strategies, namely, the ﬁnding of an optimal trade-oﬀ
between resources and algorithm’s performance.

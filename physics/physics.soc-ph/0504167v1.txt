Abstract

Datasets of online communication often take the form of contact sequences—ordered lists
contacts (where a contact is deﬁned as a triple of a sender, a recipient and a time). We pro-
pose measures of attractiveness and activity for such data sets and analyze these quantities
for anonymized contact sequences from an Internet dating community. For this data set
the attractiveness and activity measures show broad power-law like distributions. Our at-
tractiveness and activity measures are more strongly correlated in the real-world data than
in our reference model. Eﬀects that indirectly can make active users more attractive are
discussed.

1 Introduction

The Internet has revolutionized science and society in many ways. Studies of hu-
man communication networks nowadays deal with data sets of thousands people
or more. Gone are the days when one had to rely solely on interview surveys and
observational studies. These new and larger data sets open up new possibilities—
one does not only get higher precision in the measurement of network structure,
one can also rid the structural quantities of ﬁnite size eﬀects that would hinder the
prediction of phenomena such as large-scale information spreading. The accessibil-
ity of large data sets has also drawn the interest of statistical physicists, habitually
working in the large-scale limit, to this traditionally sociological ﬁeld. The sociol-
ogists themselves, naturally, contribute to the development, and make the study of
communication networks a thriving interdisciplinary arena. Internet has, of course,
changed other aspects of society than science. In the perennial human quest to ﬁnd
a partner, romantic or otherwise, the Internet provides a new modus operandi. In

this paper we study a Swedish Internet community, pussokram.com, intended for
romantic communication among adolescents. The methods we propose do not only
work for dating communities, but for Internet communities in general. Our deﬁni-
tion of an Internet community is a set of HTML-pages facilitating some type of
directed messages (i.e. not all messages are broadcasted to the whole community),
and where each member is associated with a home page. This deﬁnition includes
social networking sites (4) but excludes, for example, news groups (9). The data
we use, the same as in Ref. (11), are anonymized lists of contacts—triples (i, j, t)
where i is the ID-number of the sender, j is the ID-number of the receiver, and t
is the time (in seconds) since an arbitrary start time. The IDs are integer numbers
with no relation to the users of the real community. We do not have access to the
messages themselves, nor the individual presentations on the user homepages (or
any other text or images either).

Researched data sets of electronic communication have often been constructed
from email exchange (1; 5; 6; 15; 19; 20), and to a lesser extent from commu-
nication within Internet communities (8; 11; 17). The advantage with Internet com-
munities is that they are a closed system—all communication can be recorded. The
network of emails is a much larger and more important phenomenon. But studies
of email networks are plagued by statistical biases due to the openness of the sys-
tem. For email communication one typically samples a set of individuals and either
restricts the data to messages sent within the group (which leaves the message set
incomplete) (6) or one includes contacts to outer vertices, which does not include
contact between outer vertices. For this reason the study of Internet communities
may not only be of interest per se, but is also illuminating towards the general
structure of electronic communication.

The goal of this paper is to say something about what makes a user successful in
the community. Given our very restricted data—needless to say, the most relevant
information is in the text and imagery we do not have—is there anything that can
be said? We propose simple measures for attractiveness and activity and observe
that they are positively correlated in the contact sequences. More than that, these
two quantities are more strongly correlated for the real-world data than for the null
model we propose. It thus pays oﬀ, directly or (more likely) indirectly, to be an
active community member.

2 The community

This study is based on data from the Swedish Internet community pussokram.com,
logged over 512 days (the same data as in Ref. (11)). Before the start of this data
set pussokram.com was a facility to send anonymous e-mails. Our data starts at
pussokram.com’s beginning as a community. The number of active users grew
steadily during the sampling time. At the time of writing, the community form of

pussokram.com has ceased and the original e-mail service has been re-established.
The community form (and its preceding and sequel e-mail service) was targeted at
romantic communication among youth; this was written quite explicitly in the ad-
ministrators’ presentation and was conveyed throughout the HTML-pages by text
and iconography. This does not mean that all communication was intended to lead
to an oﬄine encounter. In fact, a fraction of the communication is probably regular
chatting rather than ﬂirting (11).

There are four modes of contacts in the community:

(1) Every user has a publicly accessible “guest book” where other users can post

messages.

(2) One can also send direct, e-mail-like, messages.
(3) Each user has a list of “friends” at her (or his) homepage. For user A to be
listed as user B’s friend, ﬁrst A has to send a “friendship request” to B . . .

(4) . . . and B has to send a “friendship acceptance” to A.

In this work we consider the sequences of guest book and message contacts sep-
arately and the contact sequence of all four types of contacts taken together. The
number of vertices (persons) N, edges (non-null dyads, i.e. pairs of vertices be-
tween which at least one contact has occurred) M and contacts (communications of
one of the four types) L are listed in Table 1.

There are several ways for a member of pussokram.com to ﬁnd others at the com-
munity: 1. At a user homepage other similar users are listed. 2. One can search
others based on attributes like gender, interests, place of residence, etc. 3. Pictures
of ∼ 50 users are displayed on the login-page. 4. The “friends” of a user is listed
at user homepages. 5. The posters of guestbook messages are displayed. 6. There
is a lengthy interview with the “user of the month.” A more detailed description of
these means of ﬁnding others is given in Ref. (11).

3 Attractiveness and activity measures

Our measure of attractiveness is the rate of incoming ﬁrst contacts, i.e. the number
of contacts a member i receives from others (s)he have not been in contact with

before divided by the total time t(i) that i has been present in the data set. How one
should determine t(i) in practice is not entirely trivial. One would like t(i) to be the
time a vertex is a visible to the rest of the community. The end-time is set by the end
of the sampling time frame tend. We chose the starting time for a vertex to be the time
(s)he sends or receives the ﬁrst contact t1(i), so that t(i) = tend − t1(i). Note that our
t(i) is an underestimate of the real presence of a user in the data—one can always
register at the community (and thus become visible to others) before sending or
receiving any measure. We assume this time is negligible. More elaborate estimates
of t1 would have to struggle with the fact a member’s behavior in the very beginning
of his/her career hardly can be estimated from the average behavior. The measure
of activity we propose is the rate of any recorded contacts made by a user, i.e. the
number of contacts made by a member divided by the same t(i) as above. In addition
to our activity and attractiveness measures we also measure the participance rate—
the number of other members a member i has contacted, or been contacted by,
divided by t(i). This measures how fast an user acquires connections to the rest of
the community. Members with a high participance rate will be the hubs of the social
network generated by the community interaction.

In Fig. 1 we plot the probability density functions for our three quantities and our
three data sets. We observe that all three quantities are highly skewed. A broad dis-
tribution of activity has been observed in Usenet communication (22) and was men-
tioned as a possible cause for the skewed degree distribution in Ref. (11). Golder
and Donath (9) discuss the roles of participants in Usenet newsgroups; their clas-
siﬁcation is partly based on the activity levels. For example, they call the most
active users “celebrities,” whereas “newbies” (new users) and “lurkers” (users who
read but do not post messages) occupy the low-end of the activity spectrum. The
fact that the pussokram.com data shows a very broad activity distribution is a sign
that it is meaningful to talk about “celebrities” and “lurkers” in this community

as well. The fat-tailed distributions of attractiveness and participance rate are less
trivial. We will discuss the origins of these and their relation to the skewed activ-
ity distribution further below. We note that the functional shape can be described
as having two diﬀerent slopes in the log-log plots of Fig. 1. This is a rather com-
mon shape of probability density functions for social and communication network
data (10; 11; 14). We will not dwell further on the details of the functional form.

Our three quantities are not independent. In Fig. 2 we plot probability densities of
the three pairs of measures. We see that all three pairs of measures are positively
correlated with each other. I.e. an active user is probably also attractive; and has
also, likely, a high participance rate. By the deﬁnitions of attractiveness and partic-
ipance rate we note that the attractiveness is strictly smaller than the participance
rate, this is evident in Fig. 2(b). The colors of Fig. 2 represent the average of the
values of the four corners. Non-zero bins that do not lie on a square with all corners
being non-zero will not contribute to these plots. For this reason the largest values
of Fig. 1 do not appear in Fig. 2.

4 Null model

In the previous section we deﬁned three vertex-speciﬁc measures for Internet com-
munity contact sequences. We measured the probability distribution and the corre-
lations between the measures. The design of the measures does not exclude that cor-
relations may be induced by the growth of the community. To frame the correlations
associated with the psychology of the community members, we need something to
compare the values with, i.e. a null model. In fact, we propose two null models,
one more and one less restricted. We follow the general approach of Ref. (12) and

sample randomizations of the real-world data set rather than constructing paramet-
ric null models. In both these models we will keep the sizes N, M and L the same
as in the original contact sequences. Not only that, we assume the growth of N is
unrelated to the psychology of the community members, we also keep the time evo-
lution of N the same as in the real data. Furthermore, as the community grows with
time the communication rate in the data should also be growing. With a paramet-
ric null model this would be hard to implement, but we just keep the set of times
from the real data and the communication rate exactly the same as in the real-world
contact sequence.

In the ﬁrst, less constrained, model we apply the restrictions above. A randomized
contact sequence is constructed as follows:

(1) For each vertex i add one contact to or from (with equal probability) at time
t1(i). The other vertex of the contact is chosen with uniform randomness among
the vertices present in the data at this time.

(2) Draw L − N times randomly from the set of non-ﬁrst contacts. (I.e. contacts
(i, j, t), such that t , t1(i) and t , t1( j).) Add contacts between vertices present
in the community at these times.

Step 1 ensures that the number of active members is the same in the randomized

6

sequence as in the real-world data. Step 2 makes the set of times almost equal
to the empirical set of times. Note that, contacts between two vertices i and j at
t = t1(i) = t1( j) will give rise to two contacts in the randomized sequence; so the
set of non-ﬁrst contacts used in step 2 will be slightly (< 1%) larger than L − N.

As mentioned in the previous section a broad activity distribution has been observed
in many data sets similar to ours. One may argue that activity is a rather indepen-
dent trait, little connected to the contact dynamics. Whether or not this is true, we
construct a null model to test how the reality diﬀers from such a scenario. To gen-
erate a random sequence realization for this model we loop over all contacts (i, j, t)
and replace j (the vertex the message is sent to) by a random vertex j′ , i present
in the community at time t. Clearly this procedure conserves L. It may result in a
few isolated vertices (vertices of zero out-degree who looses their incoming links),
and a slightly altered time evolution of N (vertices whose ﬁrst contact is incoming
may appear later in the randomized community than in the real-world data). For
our data these eﬀects are small, and we assume them to be negligible.

Values of the linear (Pearson’s) correlation coeﬃcient between attractiveness, ac-
tivity and participance rates for the real and null model networks can be found in
Table 2. First we note that the attractiveness and activity are more strongly corre-
lated in the real community than in both models, and that this holds for all three
networks. This means that the correlation between attractiveness and activity is not
an artifact of the growth of the community (by comparison with model 1), neither is
it a result of a skewed distribution of a (hypothetical) intrinsic activity (by compari-
son with model 2). Unlike the attractiveness vs. activity correlation, the correlation
between activity and participance rate seems to a large extent to be an eﬀect of the
growth of the network. We see that model 2 induces a very high correlation be-
tween activity and participance rate. Model 2 randomizes the recipients but keeps
the rest of the communication the same as in the original data. The fact that the
users engage in dialogs is an explanation for the lower correlation in the real world
data—two users sending contacts to only each other, but frequently is active but
have low participance ratio. The correlation between the participance rate and at-
tractiveness of the real data is even more diﬀerent from the null model than the
attractiveness-activity correlation. This means that the vertices of highest degree
in the social network generated by the communication are also the one that most
frequently get incoming new contacts. Another interesting observation is that the
messages data have higher attractiveness correlations than the guest book and all
contacts data. Since the messages are not publicly visible one can assume that the
real romantic communication takes place here rather than in the guest book writing.
This strengthen the conclusion that active users are attractive in Internet dating. We
note that (Spearman type) rank correlations are typically a little stronger than the
linear correlations, but since they add little new information to the discussion we
do not include them in our tables.

5 Summary and discussion

In this paper we have introduced three measures to characterize users in online
communities: attractiveness, activity and participance rate (measuring how fast a
user get to know others in the community). While these three measures are sensible
in general Internet communities, we evaluate them for an Internet dating commu-
nity (11). How and why people end up as partners is well studied in an oﬀ-line set-
ting (2; 3); attractiveness in terms of body shape (7; 18), facial characteristics (16)
and body odor (21) are all well-known. With Internet communities playing an in-
creasingly important role on the dating scene (8) one need to complement the stud-
ies of in-real-life attractiveness with investigations of online romantic preferences.
In this paper we ﬁnd that the attractiveness (the number of incoming new con-
tacts per time) is positively correlated with activity (the number of contacts taken
per time), and that this correlation is signiﬁcantly stronger than for our two null
models. We ﬁnd this heightened correlation in the real-world data even stronger in
the dataset of e-mail-like messages than in the other data sets (including messages
visible to the whole community). Since the activity, as we measure it, is rather in-
visible to other members, this correlation has to be a secondary eﬀect. (Writing in
guest books increases ones visibility and is a, presumably small, direct eﬀect.) It
is natural to assume that the users that send many messages, and thus invest much
time into their community, also spend comparatively more time embellishing their
homepages. The conclusion is thus that it pays oﬀ to spend eﬀort on one’s personal
presentation. Another factor is that highly active users are most likely logged in
more often than low-activity users. Since currently logged in users are displayed,
the increased visibility of frequently logged in members may boost the attractive-
ness of active users. We also ﬁnd highly skewed, power-law-like distributions of
attractiveness, activity and participance rate. The mechanisms behind electronic
communication and oﬄine behavior are presumably very diﬀerent. Nevertheless,
similar quantities in oﬀ-line relationships, such as the number of partners per time,
are also known have this feature (13).

Research on the structure and dynamics of Internet communities is still a young
ﬁeld. Their statistical advantages (being closed systems) compared to e-mail ex-
change make us anticipate much future work with both data analysis and modeling
approaches.

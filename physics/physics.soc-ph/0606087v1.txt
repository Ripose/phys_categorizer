Using the requisition papers of Chinese Nature Science Basic Research in management and infor-
mation department, we construct the weighted network of research areas(WRAN) represented by
the subject codes. In WRAN, two research areas are considered connected if they have been ﬁlled in
at least one requisition paper. The edge weight is deﬁned as the number of requisition papers which
have ﬁlled in the same pairs of codes. The node strength is deﬁned as the number of requisition
papers which have ﬁlled in this code, including the papers which have ﬁlled in it only. Here we
study a variety of nonlocal statistics for these networks, such as typical distances between research
areas through the network, and measures of centrality such as betweenness. These statistics char-
acteristics can illuminate the global development trend of Chinese scientiﬁc study, it is also helpful
to adjust the code system to reﬂect the real status more accurately. Finally, we present a plausible
model for the formation and structure of networks with the observed properties.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Recently, the topological properties and evolution-
ary processes of complex networks are used to de-
scribe the relationships and collective behaviors in many
ﬁelds[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Some new analysis meth-
ods and topology properties have been proposed by net-
work analysis. Also it impelled us to study the com-
plex system from the point of macroscopically view. A
network is consisted of a set of nodes and edges which
represent the relationship between any two nodes. The
topological network is denoted by an adjacent matrix
W = wij , if node i connect to node j, wij = 1; Oth-
erwise, wij = 0. Just because of its simplicity of this
description, network can be used in so many diﬀerent
subjects, such as collaboration of scientists[8, 9, 10, 11],
Internet networks[12], World-Wide Web[2], the collabo-
rative research and project bipartite network[13] and so
on. Barber et. al [13] studied the collaboration net-
work consisting of research projects funded by the Eu-
ropean Union and the organizations. They found that
the collaboration network has the main characteristics,
such as scale-free degree distribution, small average dis-
tance, high clustering and assortative node correlations.
However, the real systems are far from Boolean struc-
ture. The purely topological characterization will miss
important attributes often encountered in real systems.
So to fully characterize the interactions in real-world net-
works, weight of links should be taken into account. In
fact, there are already many works on weighted networks,
including empirical studies[14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19] and evo-
lutionary models[18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25].

The empirical study of weighted network without a
naturally given deﬁnition of weight is especially valuable
to answer questions such as how to deﬁne a well behav-

ior weight, and to extract structural information from
networks, and what’s the role of weight according to its
eﬀects on the structure of the network. We introduce
some metrics that combine in a natural way both the
topology of the connections and the weight assigned to
them. These quantities provide a general characteriza-
tion of the heterogenous statistical properties of weights
and identify alternative deﬁnitions of centrality, local co-
hesiveness, and aﬃnity. By appropriate measurements
it is also possible to exploit the correlation between the
weights and the topological structure of the network, un-
veiling the complex architecture shown by real weighted
networks.

The scientiﬁc studies can be considered as being orga-
nized within a network structure, which has a signiﬁcant
inﬂuence on the observed study collective behaviors. The
viewpoints of complex networks are of interest in study-
ing scientiﬁc study networks to uncover the structural
characteristics of WRAN. The topological statistics prop-
erties have discussed in Ref.[26]. In the fund management
department, such as National Natural Science Founda-
tion of China (NSFC), the research areas are denoted by
the code system, which have the tree structure to demon-
strate the inclusion relation between the research areas,
such as Physics–>statistical physics–>complex network.
The leave codes of the code system always represent the
research areas more specially. To make the network re-
ﬂect the reality more accurately, the nodes are deﬁned
as the codes. Because the scientists can ﬁll in the fund
proposal two codes: the ﬁrst application code and the
second one, then if one requisition paper ﬁlled in two dif-
ferent codes one can consider that the research work is
cross the two research areas. The edge weight wij be-
tween node i and j is deﬁned as the number of papers
ﬁlled in the two codes. The node strength si is deﬁned as
the number of requisition papers which have ﬁlled code
i, including the papers which have ﬁlled it only. By this
deﬁnition, the network size N is 321 in WRAN from 1999
to 2004. The network shows all the main characteristics

known from other complex network structure, such as
exponential distribution of degree, node weight and node
strength, small average path length, large clustering, and
assortative node correlations. Besides the general inter-
est in studying the new network, the study could help
us to know how the network structure aﬀects network
functions such as knowledge creation, knowledge diﬀu-
sion and the collaboration of scientists. Moreover, the
macroscopically analysis can illuminate the global devel-
opment trend of Chinese scientiﬁc study, it is also helpful
to adjust the code system to reﬂect the real status more
accurately.

II. MEASUREMENT OF WEIGHT AND BASIC
STATISTICAL RESULTS

Now we turn to the eﬀects of weight on the structure
of weighted networks. First, the interaction weight wij
is deﬁne as the number of requisition papers which have
ﬁlled in code i and code j. The strength si of node i is
deﬁned as

where Γi is the neighbor node set of node i and the ﬁtness
ηi is the number of requisition papers which ﬁlled in the
code i only. The weight wi of node i is deﬁned as

si = X
j∈Γi

wij + ηi,

wi = X
j∈Γi

wij .

2

This quantity measures the strength of nodes in terms of
the total weight of their connections. The distributions
of degree, node weight and node strength are demon-
strated in Fig.1. The probability distribution P (s) that
a node has strength s is exponential distribution, and the
functional behavior exhibits similarities with the degree
distribution P (k) (see Fig.1). The largest strength nodes
have been listed in Table 1.

A precise functional description of the exponential dis-
tributions may be very important for understanding the
network evolution and will be deferred to future analysis.
To shed more light on the relationship between the node
strength and degree, we investigate the dependence of si
on ki. We ﬁnd that the average strength s(k) and weight
w(k) of nodes with degree k increase with the degree as

s(k) ∼ kβsk, w(k) ∼ kβwk .

(3)

The real data follows the power-law behavior with ex-
ponent βsk = 1.14 ± 0.02 and βwk = 1.12 ± 0.01(see
Fig.2). The two exponents denote anomalous correla-
tions between the number of paper which has ﬁlled in one
node and the number of its connections, and imply that
the strength and weight of nodes grows faster than their
degree and the weight of edges belonging to highly con-
nected nodes tends to have a higher value. This tendency
denotes a strong correlation between the strength, node
weight and the topological properties in WRAN. The dif-
ference between βsk and βwk implies that the larger de-
gree a node is, the more ﬁtness ηi it has.

A. Distance and Centrality

1

Shortest path play an important role in the transport
and communication within a network, it have also played
an important role in the characterization of the internal
structure of a network[27, 28]. The average distance, de-
N (N −1) Pij dij , represent all the average
noted by D =
shortest path lengths of a network in which the entry
dij is the shortest path length from node i to node j.
It should be noticed that all the network nodes are not
all connected in the six years. The largest connected
group has 256, 279, 293, 290, 309 and 310 nodes, respec-
tively. The average distance is discussed on the largest

connected group. The ability of two nodes, i and j, to
communicate with each other depends on the length of
the shortest path dij between them. The average dis-
tance from node i to all other nodes is deﬁned as

Di =

1
N − 1

N

dij .

X
j=1,j6=i

(4)

In the Boolean structure network, if nodes i and j are
connected, dij = 1. In WRAN, the larger edge weight wij
is, the closer relationship between the two nodes have.
Thus, the weighted distance dij is taken dij = 1/wij.
The weighted shortest path length dij of WRAN is de-

ﬁned as the smallest sum of the distance throughout all
the possible paths in the network from node i to j. Fig-
ure 3, 4 demonstrate the topological and weighted Di
distributions from 1999 to 2004 respectively, which both
obey Passion distribution. From the two ﬁgures, we can
obtain that most nodes’ average distance Di are around
3.5 and 2.2 in topological and weighted network, respec-
tively. The nodes belonging to the left part of Passion
distribution are very important to the network, because
their average distance to all other nodes is very small.
The two inset ﬁgures show that the average distance D
of topological and weighted network decreases with time.
This may caused by the increase of the average degree
hki(See Fig. 5). Since the number of requisition papers
E can be obtained from the equation E = N hki approxi-
mately, the real reason why the average distance decrease
may lie in the increasing number of requisition papers.

B. Average Clustering coeﬃcient

The local clustering coeﬃcient of node i, denoted by
Ci, is a measure of the connectedness between the neigh-
bors of the node, which is called transitivity in the social
network[1, 27]. If a node i has a link to node j and node j
has a link to node k, then a measure of transitivity in the
network is the probability that node i has a link to node
k. Let ki denote the degree of node i, and let Ei denote
the number of link between the ki neighbors. Then, for
an undirected network, the quantity[1]

is the ratio of the number of links between a node’s neigh-
bors to the number of links that can exist. The clustering
N
coeﬃcient C is deﬁned as C = 1/N P
i=1 Ci. In WRAN,
the clustering coeﬃcient indicates the probability that
a node connects to its 2nd nearest neighbors. Figure 6
presents the statistic result of C(k) ∼ k. From Fig.6, we
can obtain that there are no correlation between C(k)
and k before 2003, but the correlation emerged since
2003, which is a characteristic of hierarchical network.
The reason may lie in the fact that the code system has
been adjusted around 2002. This result indicates that the
rectiﬁcation make the relationship of the subject codes
becoming more clear.

intensity actually found on the local triplets.
cw
i counts for each triplet formed in the neighborhood
of the node i the weight of the two participating edges
of the node i. In this way we are considering not just
the number of closed triplets in the neighborhood of a
node but also their total relative weight with respect to
the strength of the node. Consistently, the cw
i deﬁni-
tion recovers the topological clustering coeﬃcient in the
case that wij is constant and ηi = 0. Next we deﬁne Cw
and Cw(k) as the weighted clustering coeﬃcient averaged
over all nodes of the network and over all nodes with de-
gree k, respectively. These quantities provide global in-
formation on the correlation between weights and topol-
ogy, especially by comparing them with their topolog-
ical analogs. Figure 7 presents the power-law correla-
tions Cw(k) ∼ kα between Cw(k) and degree k, where
α = −2.15 ± 0.06, which may be caused by the intro-
duction of node ﬁtness ηi. Because the larger the degree
k is the larger ηi would have, the denominator of Equ.
(6) would become more larger, then Cw(k) would be-
come small. If replace si of Equ.(6) with ki, we get the
deﬁnition of weighted clustering coeﬃcient presented in
Ref.[17]. Figure 8 presents the relationship between Cw
and C of WRAN. The fact Cw < C signals a network
in which the topological clustering is generated by edges
with low weight or by nodes with larger ﬁtness. In this
case the clustering has a minor eﬀect in the organization
of the network because the largest part of the interac-
tions is occurring on edges not belonging to intercon-
nected triplets. The ﬁgure also indicates that C increase
with time, while Cw keep constant. Interestingly, C in-
crease dramatically about 10 percent from 2002 to 2003.
This change is consistent with the correlation C(k) ∼ k.
Along with the weighted clustering coeﬃcient,
we introduce the weighted average nearest-neighbors

In this case, we perform a local weighted average of
the nearest-neighbor degree according to the normalized
weight of the connecting edges, wij /si. This deﬁnition
implies that if the edges with the larger weight are point-
ing to the neighbors with larger degree, kw
nn,i > knn,i;
In the opposite case kw

sures the eﬀective aﬃnity to connect with high- or low-
degree neighbors according to the magnitude of the ac-
tual interactions. Moreover, kw
nn(k) marks the weighted
assortative or disassortative properties considering the
actual interactions among the systems elements. Figure
9 presents the topological and weighted average nearest-
neighbors degree of 1999 and 2004, which demonstrate
that kw
nn,i > knn,i and both of them have the trend of
increasing with the degree k.

The positive assortative coeﬃcient r, which is pre-
sented by Ref.
[29, 30], of WRAN has presented in
Fig.10, which means that the nodes with higher de-
gree would like to connect each other. Figure 2 told us
that the nodes, whose degree is large, must have larger
strength. Then, the nodes with more strength would like
to connect each other.

C. Betweenness

The communication of two non-adjacent nodes, called
j and k, depends on the nodes belonging to the paths
connecting j and k. Consequently, the deﬁnition node
betweenness is present to measure the relevance of a given
node by counting the number of geodesics going through
it. The betweenness is one of the standard measures of

is an indicator of which node is the most inﬂuential one in
the network is. The nodes with highest betweenness also
result in the largest increase in typical distance between
others when they are removed. The nodes with largest
betweenness have listed in Table 2. These nodes are the
most important one for information transitivity.

strength of the network would increase by 1 with the
probability p; With the probability (1 − p), each existing
node i selects m other existing nodes for potential inter-
action according to the probability Equ. (9). Here, the
parameter m is the number of candidate nodes for cre-
ating or strengthening connections, p is the probability
that a node would enhance ηi by 1.

mutually selected, then an new connection will be built
between them. If two connected nodes select each other,
then their existing connection will be strengthened, i.e.,
their edge weight will be increased by 1. We will see
that the model can generate the observed properties of
WRAN. When p = 0.01 and m = 5, the numerical results
to diﬀerent time step T are demonstrated in Fig. 13-??.

Cw(k) ∼ kλ relationship. From the inset of Fig.14. (b),
one can see that when the time step T is very small, there
is no correlation between C(k) and k, while when T is be-
come large, the correlation emerge, which consistent with
C(k) ∼ k of WRAN. Figure 14. (b) gives the power-law
relationship Cw(k) ∼ kα, where α = 1.11 ± 0.05, which
also consistent with the one of WRAN. The inset of Fig-
ure 14.(d) gives the Zipf plots of node betweenness to
diﬀerent time step T . All of the above structural char-
acters of MSM are consistent with the ones of WRAN
approximately, which indicate that the mutual selection
mechanism and the probability p may be the evolving
mechanism of WRAN.

III. A MUTUAL SELECTION MODEL

In this section, we present a mutual selection model
(MSM) to compare with WRAN. Inspired by the ﬁtness
ηi and the mutual selection mechanism, the model is de-
ﬁned as following. The model starts from N isolated

We have studied the Chinese Nature Science Basic Re-
search in management and information department from
weighted network point of view. To describe the status
of WRAN more accurately, the requisition papers which
have ﬁlled in only one subject code is also considered,
which is deﬁned as node ﬁtness. We have looked at a
variety of nonlocal properties of our networks.

Using this measure we have added weighting to WRAN
and used the resulting networks to ﬁnd which code have
the largest strength, the shortest average distance to oth-
ers. Generalization of the clustering coeﬃcient and be-
tweenness calculations to these weighted networks is also
straightforward. The statistic characterization give the
following conclusions

(1). The code system have adjusted around 2002 and the
correlation between C(k) ∼ k emerges since 2003.

(2). The topological and weighted distance decrease with
time, while the clustering coeﬃcient increases with
time.

(3). The distributions of degree, edge weight and node

strength have exponential form.

(4). The larger the node degree is, the larger ﬁtness it

would be.

(5). WRAN is assortative, which means that the node
with large strength would like to connect each
other.

In terms of structural characteristics of WRAN, the
present analysis yields a plausible model. Based on the
mutual selection mechanism and the probability p that
one node would increase its strength without creating
new connectivity with others, we presented MSM model.
Most of the structural characters of MSN are consistent
with the ones of WRAN.

The calculations presented in this paper inevitably rep-
resent only a small part of the investigations that could
be conducted using large network data sets such as these.
We hope, given the high current level of interest in net-
work phenomena, that others will ﬁnd many further uses
for these data.

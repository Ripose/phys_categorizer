We investigate a simple multisegment cellular automaton model of traﬃc ﬂow. With the introduc-
tion of segment-dependent deceleration probability, metastable congested states in the intermediate
density region emerge, and the initial state dependence of the ﬂow is observed. The essential feature
of three-phased structure empirically found in real-world traﬃc ﬂow is reproduced without elaborate
assumptions.

INTRODUCTION

The cellular automata models have established them-
selves as the standard in the analysis of traﬃc ﬂow with
the simplicity, the aﬃnity to computer simulations, and
also with the extendibility to handle the realistic traﬃc
[1, 2]. Particularly appealing aspects to is its capability
to capture the essential characteristics of the traﬃc ﬂow
with very few system parameters, which is a surprising
economy of assumptions. With further assumptions for
the adoption to the speciﬁc cases, the model is shown
to be capable to reproduce details of the traﬃc ﬂow in
various settings, and it has been used for the analysis of
real-life traﬃc with great success in past decade [3].

Lost in this process of elaboration, however, is the sim-
ple elegance of generality which the original standard
model possesses . In fact, there seems to be an obvious
generic feature of the traﬃc ﬂow that is beyond the reach
of original model, but appears to await the explanation
with a simple model. That is the three phase structure.
In a typical traﬃc, the low and high density regions show
the free motion and traﬃc jam. In the fundamental di-
agram of traﬃc, that plots the ﬂow against the density,
they are respectively represented by the increasing and
decreasing lines, both of which are reproduced well with
the standard model. In the intermediate density, how-
ever, empirical data indicate the existence of the third
phase, in which there is no clear single line in the fun-
damental diagram, but the points are scattered in broad
region.

In this article, we intend to show that this third phase
appears in a very simple extension of the standard model
that includes segments which has diﬀerent system param-
eters. These segments are introduced to represent the
natural bottlenecks – narrow road segments, hilly seg-
ments, a segment under construction, etc. – that are
ubiquitous in real-life traﬃc. We base our discussion pri-
marily on numerical simulations and supplement them
with simple intuitive physical arguments.

II. CELLULAR AUTOMATA TRAFFIC MODEL
WITH PROBABILISTIC ACCELERATION IN
MULTI-SEGMENTED ROAD

We ﬁrst lay out our model. A road is divided by a one-
dimensional array of L cells on which M cars are placed.
The location (i.e. cell number) and the velocity of the
cars are represented by integers xi and vi with the car
index i = 1, 2, ..., M . Cars are indexed in ascending order
to the direction of the motion without overlap; x1 < x2 <
... < xM . The road is considered to be circular, so that
the (L + 1)-th cell is identiﬁed with the ﬁst cell. The
road is subdivided into S segments S1 = {x|0 < x ≤
L1}, S2 = {x|L1 < x ≤ L1 + L2}, ..., SS = {x|L1 +
... + LS−1 < x ≤ L}, with the constraint on the sub-
length L1 + ... + LS = L. Each segment, s = 1, ..., S, is
assigned its own maximum velocity Us and deceleration
(non-acceleration) probability Rs. The time evolution of
the system in a discrete time step is described by the
following three consecutive updating for vi and xi ∈ Ss;

1) Probabilistic acceleration :

vi −→ max(vi + 1, Us) with probability(1 − Rs)

2) Breaking to avoid collision :
vi −→ min(vi, xi+1 − xi − 1).

(1)

3) Advancement :
xi −→ xi + vi.

The updating is done in parallel for all cars i = 1, 2, ...M :
Namely, the current position of the preceding car is used
to calculate the distance xi+1 − xi − 1.

The model can be thought of as a variant of the stan-
dard Nagel-Schreckenberg (NS) model in that it follows
the acceleration and deceleration step-by-step. In fact,
if we change the ordering of “breaking” and “random
deceleration” in the standard NS model, we obtain a
model where cars accelerate, and then randomly deceler-
ate. The model then becomes almost identical to ours,
apart from the treatment of the cars running at the max-
imum velocities. This inverting of the order eﬀectively
prohibits the cars running in the jam from random decel-
eration, thus models the “heightened alertness” of drivers

acceleration rate R is varied from R = 0 to 0.8 as indicated
in the graph. The maximum velocity is ﬁxed at U = 8 for all
cases. The size of the road is set to be L = 200.

who have preceding cars in their close sight. Our model
is also related to the Fukui-Ishibashi (FI) model in that
both employ probabilistic acceleration, which is in con-
trast to the NS model that treats the process by slitting
it into acceleration and probabilistic deceleration.

Using the second step of the rule (1), we may deﬁne a
jam as a block of cars in which the distance of neighboring
cars is below the maximum velocity, A crucial feature of
our model is the existence of the metastable block of
jam made up of equi-spaced cars. This is a direct result
of our model in which no further random deceleration
occurs for cars inside the jam. The only limiting factor
of the growth of this block is the percolation at the head
of the block whose rate is proportional to (1 − Rs). This
feature captures oft observed self-forming bottleneck of
slow-moving cars in single-lane roads in real-life traﬃc.
This could be regarded as a main justiﬁcation for devising
yet another variant of traﬃc cellular automaton model.

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS

We perform numerical simulations on the model pre-
sented above with one segment, two-segments, and eight
segments cases, the last one being the model of generic
realistic traﬃc.

The macroscopic characteristics of traﬃc systems are
best summarized with so-called fundamental diagram,
which is the traﬃc ﬂux F plotted as the function of traﬃc
density ρ, each of which are deﬁned as

Here, hit stands for the average over many time steps t.
We ﬁrst show the results of the single-segment traﬃc
in FIG. 1. The size of the road is set to be L = 200

and the maximum velocity is chosen to be U = 8. Fun-
damental diagram with various non-acceleration rates R
are shown. Each point in the graph represents the results
of 20,000 iteration starting from a single random initial
conﬁguration. In the diagram, we observe three distinct
regimes of traﬃc ﬂow. In between the free traﬃc regime
at low density and jamming regime at high density, we
observe a distinct partial jamming regime at intermediate
density. Here, the ﬂux displays the sensitive dependence
on the initial condition, which is shown in the graph as
jittery structures. It is certainly possible to consider the
ensemble of initial conditions among which the results
could be averaged out to obtain smooth curves. How-
ever, we can also argue that it is a realistic feature of
the model that it has a regime where there is non-unique
value of ﬂux for traﬃcs with same density but diﬀerent
initial conﬁgurations. The existence of the intermediate
region is a result of ﬁnite size eﬀect, as can be proven
by the explicit calculation showing the shrinking of this
region with larger L. At the limit L → ∞, fundamental
diagram with two phases with discontinuous F (ρ) is ob-
tained. However, this intermediate region develop into a
distinct phase when there are more than two segments,
S ≥ 2 in the road.

That is clearly seen in FIG. 2, in which the fundamen-
tal diagram of two segment model with L = 400 split into
L1 = 160 and L2 = 40 is shown. Here, we set a common
deceleration rate and diﬀerent maximum velocities for
two segments. By the inspection, existence of analytical
solution represented by the straight lines connecting the
origin and ρ = 1 with zero ﬂux and two critical densi-
ties ρ† and ρ⋆ at the plateau ﬂux F ⋆ is expected. At
the critical density ρ†, the block of jam with vi = U2
and neighboring distance U2 + 1 is formed in the second
segments while the traﬃc is at full speed vi = U1 with
neighboring distance U1 + 1 in the ﬁrst segment. At ρ⋆,
however, the jam with vi = U2 ﬁlls the entire system.
With elementary calculations, we obtain the critical den-

At the plateau region ρ† ≤ ρ ≤ ρ⋆, the ﬂow is
limited by the block of the “locally optimal” spacing
xi+1 − xi = U2 + 1 formed in the low maximum velocity
segment. As the density increases, this block gets ex-
tended into the high maximum velocity region, in which
drivers perceive the block as congestion. The length of
the block is determined by the requirement that “free
traﬃc” segment has the density that corresponds to the
same ﬂux with the block, (6).

Note that the diﬀerence between two critical densities
ρ† and ρ⋆ persists at the continuum limit Ls → ∞ if the
ratio L1/L2 is kept constant. This clearly shows that
the appearance of the intermediate plateau region is not
the artifact of the discretization nor the ﬁniteness of the
model. Thus this third region can be legitimately re-
garded as the third phase. The three phase structure
thus obtained is reminiscent to that obtained with the
stop-and-go dynamics [5]. The metastable characteris-
tics of the blocks is essential in obtaining this structure.
The situation becomes even more interesting when dif-
ferent non-acceleration rates are assigned to the diﬀerent
segments. In FIG. 3, the fundamental diagrams with a
common Us and the diﬀerent Rs are shown. Here, in be-
tween the free traﬃc phase at low density region ρ < ρ†
and jamming phase at high density region ρ > ρ⋆, we
clearly observe an intermediate phase where there is wild
oscillations in F (ρ). Diﬀerent outcome is obtained from
diﬀerent initial conﬁguration. A most striking feature,
however, is the fact that, in this intermediate region, the
the values of the ﬂow F is descretized at the fractions

F =

V
V + 1

,

V = 1, 2, ..., U1.

(7)

The cause of this discretization and ﬂuctuation is again
the appearance of metastable blocks composed of equi-
spaced cars moving in common velocity V . The road seg-
ment with high-Rs hinders the percolation of the blocks,
and helps the development of its aggregation. Thus, in
eﬀect, the high Rs segment works very similar to the
low-Us segment in previous example. A crucial diﬀer-
ence, however, is that the block velocity V is not preset.
Metastable blocks with diﬀerent V can appear and dom-
inate depending on the initial condition, which results in
non-unique value for F at each ρ.

Our claim of the appearance of plural metastable bot-
tleneck blocks are corroborated by the ﬂow pattern shown
in FIG. 4, which is obtained from the same simulation as
in FIG. 3. FIG. 4(a) and FIG. 4(b) are the results of
same parameters but diﬀerent initial conditions. clearly,
metastable congestion blocks with diﬀerent internal car
spacing (thus diﬀerent block velocities) are becoming the
limiting factors of the total ﬂow.

We now move on to show that the two-segment re-
sults obtained above essentially represent generic result

present the results of six segment traﬃc, which is consid-
ered as a toy model of realistic single-lane “county-road”
traﬃc. Road length is set to be L = 900. The road
is now made up of the “normal” segments s = 1, 3, 5
with R1 = R3 = R5 = 0.1, and the bottleneck segments
s = 2, 4, 6, each having R2 = 0.4, R4 = 0.5 and R6 = 0.6.
The length of each segments are set to be L1 = 355,
L2 = 30, L3 = 300, L4 = 60, L5 = 110 and L6 = 45.
These arbitrary numbers are chosen to make this case a
generic example. A common maximum velocity Us = 10
is used for all s. We ﬁnd the result to be essentially indis-
tinguishable to the case of two segments. This is to be

on road with many segments, the ones with smallest ﬂux
among them will eventually absorb the rest and becomes
the limiting bottleneck, thus determine the total ﬂow of
the system.

IV. SUMMARY AND PROSPECTS

number of cars. It is possible to construct a simple cel-
lular automaton model which capture this puzzling fea-
tures of realistic traﬃc ﬂow. Our model has a property of
self-aggregating jamming block. This feature results in
the existence of the third phase at intermediate density
where visually striking non-unique ﬂux is observed for a
given density. It is our view, that among the multiple
possible variants of original NS models, ones with such
property are deﬁnitely worth further attention.

On the other hand, we want to make clear that the
introduction of the alternative new rule (1) is not the
prerequisite for the existence of the third phase. In fact,
it can be shown through the numerical simulations that
the three phase structure is already present in multiseg-
ment model with standard NS rules. With our modiﬁed
rule that allows the formation of metastable blocks of
jam, the new phase obtains distinct characteristics.

It is worth mentioning that the state of the system
in the newly identiﬁed third regime at intermediate
density shares many common features with so-called
self-organized criticality [6]. It is as though the system is
at critical point for extended range of parameter values
with various competing metastable states formed spon-
taneously without ﬁne-tuning of the system.
It should
be interesting to check, for example, the size distribution
of the jamming blocks, a hall mark of self-organized
criticality, to further clarify the connection.

In real-life traﬃc, we often experience diﬀerent mode
of congestion on diﬀerent days on same roads with similar

lightening discussions.

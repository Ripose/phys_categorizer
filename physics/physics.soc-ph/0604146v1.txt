Abstract
This paper presents the results of the application of a bit-string model of lan-
guages (Schulze and Stauﬀer 2005) to problems of taxonomic patterns. The ques-
tions addressed include the following: (1) Which parameters are minimally needed
for the development of a taxonomic dynamics leading to the type of distribution of
language family sizes currently attested (as measured in the number of languages
per family), which appears to be a power-law? (2) How may such a model be
coupled with one of the dynamics of speaker populations leading to the type of
language size seen today, which appears to follow a log-normal distribution?

1 Introduction

With few exceptions, such as Nettle (1999a,b), linguists have been little con-
cerned with quantitative modeling and simulation, possibly due to the myriad
of qualitative phenomena that scholars must analyze. An immense amount of
structural diﬀerences exist not only from one language to the next, but also
among diﬀerent kinds of sociolinguistic situations. More recently, however,
scholars belonging to the entirely diﬀerent discipline of physics have taken an
interest in simulating the aspect of historical sociolinguistics which concerns
the competition among languages and have looked at how such competition
may lead to various patterns of growth or extermination (see Schulze and
Stauﬀer 2006 for a review). This interest among physicists for modeling lan-
guage competition was triggered by Abrams and Strogatz (2003), who use
diﬀerential equations to describe the vanishing of one language due to the

1

dominance of another. Since then, a series of articles have appeared. For in-
stance, Patriarca and Lepp¨anen (2004) applied the Abrams-Strogatz model
to a geographical situation where two languages, X and Y, may dominate
in each their region, resulting in the survival of both, rather as in the orig-
inal model where only one language will survive. Oliveira et al. (2006a,b)
have looked at models in which speakers of small languages will tend to
switch to geographically more widespread ones, to account for the fact that
real geographical areas tend not to show equally-sized languages. Along the
lines of the broader cultural model of Axelrod (1997), Te¸sileanu and Meyer-
Ortmanns (2006) looked at the consequences of the possibility that a greater
similarity among languages might further language shift. We build on some
of this work, but so far the present paper is to our knowledge the ﬁrst in this
recent tradition to address the issue of taxonomic dynamics.

2 Why simulate

Human languages have existed for at least about 104 years, possible much
longer. Only a few percent of this development is to some extent documented
through writing, while another few percent may be inferred by comparative
linguistic methods. Thus, we have no clues to aspects of the development
of languages for 80% or more of their history other than what we might in-
fer from abstract extrapolation or from simulations. Like the distant past,
the future is also empirically impenetrable. Two aspects of simulations are
important. First, we may hope to identify a minimal number of parameters
that account for the present state of aﬀairs seen as a result of a long devel-
opment. Secondly, we may adjust these parameters to test the predictions
that diﬀerent models provide. It should be stressed that simulations are not
necessarily suited to prove any particular model or to make predictions about
what is in store for the languages of today; they can only represent tests of
diﬀerent models. Nor can the parameters identiﬁed be translated into di-
rect explanatory factors for actual distributions. For instance, a simulation
of language competition might restrict its parameters to, say, the relative
size of languages and it might stipulate some simple mode of interaction,
such as the tendency for speakers of smaller languages to shift to contigu-
ous larger ones. Such a model might lead to a plausible picture of language
distributions, perhaps even one resembling the current state of aﬀairs. But
this does not mean that this distribution is explained by language sizes and

2

competition alone. The growth of a given language relates to socioeconomic,
historical, geographical, ecological and many other circumstances. Since a
primary aim of simulation is to reduce the set of parameters, it cannot and
should not, however, take into account all relevant factors, but must remain
an abstraction.

3 The aim of the investigation

Wichmann (2005) made some simple observations about the present-day
quantitative distribution of language family sizes, as measured in numbers of
languages per family, and about the distribution of language sizes, as mea-
sured in numbers of speakers per language (data drawn from Ethnologue).
It was found that language family sizes approximate a so-called ‘power-law’,
that is, a distribution described by the equation y = axb, which corresponds
to a straight line on a log-log plot. Such distributions are frequent in both
nature and the social world (cf. Newman 2005 for an excellent overview).
The slope of the curve on the rank-by-size plot is described by the exponent
b, which was found to be −1.905.
(For a histogram of the number n(S)
of languages versus their size S this corresponds to another power-law with
exponent −1 − 1/1.905, and if this histogram sums the raw numbers into
bins whose size is proportional to the language size, then the exponent is
−1/1.905.)

When testing for the distribution of language sizes, however, no power-
law emerged. The absence of a power-law distribution also comes out of
studies by Novotny and Drozd (2000) and Sutherland (2003). (Gomes et al.
1999: 493) had earlier plotted the same data on a graph showing the cumu-
lative size distribution, n(> S), corresponding to the number of languages
with a size greater than S. Cutting the curve up into diﬀerent regions and
describing each by a separate equation they then made the problematical
claim of the existence of a “composite power-law”). The present paper takes
up the challenge of Wichmann (2005: 139) to test, using computer simu-
lations, what the expected past and future distributions of language family
sizes and language sizes might look like. The question was raised whether
the present distribution of language sizes might be characteristic of a stage of
disequilibrium while the expected equilibrium might correspond to a power-
law. Stauﬀer et al. (2006) supported the hypothesis of a disequilibrium. In
the present paper we also report on language families.

4 The bit-string model

The model used is one eminently suited to computation. It is a variant of
that of Schulze and Stauﬀer (2005), which operates with bit-strings of length
L, where each bit has two values and where the total set of possible dialects
has 2L members. (A precursor to this kind of modelling is Wang and Minett
2005, which used strings of integers to simulate branching by the mutation
and transfer of numbers.)

Each bit may be interpreted as the presence or absence of some character-
istic grammatical feature. Under this interpretation we might imagine that
a number of diagnostic features were identiﬁed, the presence or absence of
each of which would be suﬃcient to distinguish among the grammars of the
world’s languages. This number corresponds to the length of the bit-string.
An alternative model of language competition, also allowing for thou-
sands of diﬀerent languages, is that of de Oliveira et al (2006a,b). There,
however, languages are characterized merely by consecutive numbers 1, 2, 3,
..., which is not suitable for simulating diﬀerent taxonomic levels.
In this
model, language families would have to be determined by the history of lan-
guage dynamics and their genealogical tree (Schulze and Stauﬀer 2006), and
testing this approach is outside the scope of the present work. The other
recent models of language competition to our knowledge allow only a rela-
tively small number of languages and are, for this reason, also less suitable
for taxonomy.

We test two diﬀerent variants of the model. In one, which we might call
the “hierarchical” variant, the bit-string is divided into subsections corre-
sponding to diﬀerent taxonomic levels. Two languages are deﬁned as belong-
ing to the same family if their “family” parts of the bit-strings agree.
In
the other, “ﬂat” variant, there is no such partitioning of the string. Instead,
taxonomic levels are achieved by deﬁned a certain threshold k of diﬀerences
among languages. Diﬀerences are measured by comparing two strings and
noting the number of positions for which the two strings diﬀer. If the diﬀer-
ence is greater than k, the two languages are said to belong to diﬀerent taxa.
In both versions of the model we only operate with two taxonomic levels, but
both could be extended to include more levels. In the following, each variant
is described in more detail.

4

4.1 The hierarchical variant

This model achieves two taxonomic levels by partitioning the bit-string. The
two levels may be conceptualized as corresponding to language families and
languages within one family, respectively, but need not be translated ex-
actly into these concepts (which are themselves not very well deﬁned). The
languages of individuals may be classiﬁed by comparing the bit-strings rep-
resenting each individual. In the following we illustrate how the model works
if we use a bit-string of length 64. People speaking the same language have
to agree in all bits. In our implementation we have chosen to stipulate that
people speaking languages belonging to the same family have to agree in the
leftmost 19 bits. For example,

01101010011110101010-11101010010101101010010111010101010011100001
01101010011110101010-11101010010101101010010111010101010011101001

are two diﬀerent (even if potentially closely related) languages, while

00101001101010100011-10100101011011010101110101010110101010100111
00101001101010100011-01011010001011000110010101110000110101001100

are two diﬀerent languages belonging to the same family and

10100110100101011010-10010110101010101111010101101001110001010001
01011011010101101010-10100011110101011010101000110101010011101101

are two diﬀerent languages belong to two diﬀerent families.
In these ex-
amples the dash “-” just indicates the boundary between the two segments
of the string, analogously to the convention for phone numbers, which are
structured much like our bit-string model.

The choice of lengths of the whole string and its parts is of course arbi-
trary, and need not be 19 + 45 = 64. Nevertheless, various considerations led
to single out certain lengths as more suitable than other. First, the model
is computationally most eﬀective for bit-string lengths which are powers of
2. Second, a shorter string is to be preferred to a longer one, all else being
equal—again for computational reasons. Third, the string should not be so
short that the sheer length imposes artiﬁcial constraints on the results. In
earlier simulations the eﬀect of diﬀerent lengths (L = 8, 16, 32, and 64)
were tested. Since it was found that the results were qualitatively similar for
L = 16, 32, and 64, all values of L higher than or equal to 16 would be equally
suitable. Adding the criterion of minimal computation cost would single out
L = 16 as preferable. However, we found that for this length a maximum

5

number of languages was reached before a meaningfully interpretable distri-
bution was found. (Unlike the 32 and 64 bit-string models and the real-life
present-day distribution, see section 5 below, this did not lead to a power-
law distribution, since power-laws require the absence of upper bounds. At
a point where either all possible languages or all possible families are ﬁlled,
the power-law distribution breaks down.) Instead, we have chosen a string
with the larger length of 32 bits, of which the leading 10 bits deﬁne families
and the remaining 22 deﬁne languages, yielding 210 = 1024 possible ‘families’
and 222 = 4, 194, 304 posssible ‘languages’). Using an ample L also ensures
that accidental ‘back mutation’, i.e. the phenomenon whereby, by chance, an
identical bit-string occurs after some mutations–something which would not
happen in real life–will occur so exceedingly rarely that its eﬀects are com-
pletely negligible. (Even for L = 8 this situation occurs rarely, cf. Schulze
and Stauﬀer 2006). Simulations using 64 bits, of which 19 bits are reserved
for families and the remaining 45 bits for languages were also made (allowing
for 219 = 524, 288 possible ‘families’ and 245 = 35, 184, 372, 088, 832 possible
‘languages’). The results were qualitatively similar.

Diﬀerentiation is simulated by setting the probability of the change in a
bit to 0.0001 per iteration. An iteration is equivalent to a certain, average
time step. After some time steps, a bit in either the family sub-string or the
language bit-string will change, meaning the creation of a new entity at one
of these levels. Given that there are fewer bits in the family bit-string, there
is a smaller probability of a change in this part of the string per iteration,
and there will therefore be a slower dynamics of families than of languages.
In practice, with probability 0.0001L at each iteration, one of the L bits is
selected randomly and then reverted, i.e. changed from 0 to 1 or from 1 to
0. In this process, analogously to biological mutations, all bit positions are
equivalent and neither 0 nor 1 is in any way preferred.

We neglect here for simplicity the diﬀusion of features from one language
to the other used in other simulations involving this model. We assume a
shift from small to large populations stipulating that at each iteration with
probability (1 − x)2 or (1 − x2) each individual gives up his/her old language
and instead selects the language of one randomly selected individual of the
whole population.
Individuals get one child per iteration, and everybody
dies with a Verhulst probability proportional to the current population size,
something which takes into account factors such as limited food and space.
We usually start with a population corresponding roughly to the equilibrium
size determined by these Verhulst deaths, where everybody starts with a

6

randomly selected language. After some time, one language may dominate
and be spoken by more than 80 percent of the population. Stauﬀer et al.
(2006a) list a complete Fortran program. The histograms of the number of
languages spoken by a given number of people are smoothened by random
multiplicative noise as in Stauﬀer et al. (2006b), which may correspond to
external perturbations caused by migrations of individuals, intermarriage,
changing political circumstances, and other non-systematic factors.

4.2 The ﬂat variant

This model is in all but one major respect similar to the hierarchical model.
The diﬀerence is that taxonomic levels are achieved not by partitioning the
string, but by stipulating that two languages which diﬀer in more than one
bit belong to diﬀerent families. The size of each language family (i.e., the
numbers of languages in each) is then measured by the number of languages
that diﬀer by just one bit from one reference language. We sum over all
reference languages, and also over many samples, to get out ﬁnal statistics.
The deﬁnition allows one language to belong to diﬀerent families, just as one
person can belong to diﬀerent friendship groups. Instead, one would get a
clear separation into diﬀerent families without such overlaps if we demand all
languages within one family to be separated directly or indirectly by not more
than one bit ﬂip. But since we can move from each bit-string of 64 bits to
every other possible bit-string through at most 64 such changes of single bits,
this deﬁnition would mean that all possible languages form one huge family,
which is not what we want. (Analogously, on a square lattice we can deﬁne a
neighbourhood as the set of four nearest neighbours of a given site; then every
lattice site belongs to several neighbourhoods. Alternatively, a cluster can
be deﬁned as the set of all sites connected directly or indirectly with a given
site; then the whole lattice forms one large cluster. Neither deﬁnition leads to
what we would like to have, which is non-overlapping clusters, corresponding
to non-overlapping language families. A further disadvantage of the model
is that its equilibrium is either dominance of one language spoken by most
people, or fragmentation into numerous languages of about equal size; thus
for dominance there is not much to analyze and for fragmentation nearly
all languages could form one cluster, meaning that these more sophisticated
deﬁnitions might not work better in equilibrium.)

5 Results

5.1 Results for the application of the hierarchical model

The major results are shown in ﬁgs. 1-2 and 4-5. The interest of these are
the shapes of the various curves, not the absolute numbers corresponding
to each point. The mismatch between large numbers of families and small
sizes of languages as compared to the real-world situation is due to the sum-
mation over iterations and could be normalized, but this would only serve
presentational purposes.

In ﬁg. 1 it is shown how size histograms of families strongly depend
on the temporal factor. At the initial stage of the simulation (t = 1) we
see something close to a normal distribution (the rightmost curve in the
diagram). At t = 10 the distribution forms a parabola (curve connecting x’s).
This distribution is close to what the present-day language size distribution
looks like (see ﬁg. 6). At t = 60 (stars) a curve resembling the present-
day distribution of language family sizes (ﬁg. 3) is obtained, but it has a
large hump on the right region of the curve. The real-life distribution also
has a hump, but it is much smaller. At 300 iterations (squares) there is
a discontinuous distribution with a number of small families and a leap up
to a number of larger ones, which form a narrow normal distribution. Fig.
2a focuses on the range 20 ≤ t ≤ 150, where the distribution most closely
resembles the present-day one, and varies the population size N to see the
dependency on the graph on that variable. It appears that there is not much
inﬂuence of N, provided t is increased with increasing N. Moreover, ﬁg.
2a suggests that the closest approximation to the present-day distribution is
found around 102 iterations. Statistically solid results for a long run of the
64-bit model in ﬁg. 2b provide similar results.

We now turn to the results for language sizes. Fig. 4 shows the sizes for
the same number of iterations as in ﬁg. 1. Since the simulations start with
fragmentation, t = 1 represents a situation with many languages spoken by
single speakers (single +). At t = 10 (x symbols) a curve roughly like a
parabola and already strongly reminiscent of the present-day situation (ﬁg.
6) has begun to form. At t = 60 (stars) this distribution is beginning to
disrupt, as evidenced by the right tail. This situation further develops into
one with many large languages and many small ones, with a large gap for
language sizes in between, as shown by the curve for t = 300 (squares). Again
we narrow in on the range, 20 ≤ t ≤ 60, where the best approximation of the

8

present situation (ﬁg. 6) is found and vary the population size (ﬁg. 5). For
t = 40 and N = 50, 000 the distribution closely approximates the present-day
one.

By comparing the curves for t = 40 in ﬁgs. 2a and 5 an interesting
observation is obtained: at identical time steps the curve for language family
sizes may approximate a power-law while the curve for language sizes does
not, but rather something close to a parabola, as in real life. Wichmann
(2005: 128) hypothesized that both curves should approximate a power-law,
but the simulations rather suggest that this is only the case for language
family sizes, at least given the model and the setting of parameters assumed
here.

The overall result, then, suggests that neither the present-day distribu-
tion of language family sizes nor that of language sizes are unexpected and
that both may have been obtained for a long time and may continue to be
obtained. Eventually a dominance of just one large language accompanied
by other slightly diﬀerent languages is possible, but this situation has not
yet set in.

5.2 Results for the application of the ﬂat model

For investigating the distance among languages the ‘ﬂat’ model is most useful
because the distance among two languages belonging to two diﬀerent families
in the hierarchical model cannot easily be measured. (The hierarchical bit-
strings representing languages in any two languages belong to two diﬀerent
families are not comparable since the positions no longer mean the same
when one moves up one taxonomic level.) Thus we measured diﬀerences
in simulations implementing the non-hierarchical model, i.e. the standard
model of Schulze and Stauﬀer (2005, 2006) where all bits are equivalent. As
in most of our previous studies, only short bit-strings of 8 or 16 bits were
used, and the random multiplicative noise was omitted; for these studies we
waited until a stationary state after about 103 iterations was established.

The distance measure used is the so-called ‘Hamming distances’, also
investigated by Te¸sileanu and Meyer-Ortmanns (2006). The Hamming dis-
tance between two bit-strings is the number of bits which are diﬀerent in a
position-by-position comparison of the two strings. For example, the Ham-
ming distance between 01001101 and 11000011 is four.

As explained above, we deﬁne a language family in this model as a set
of languages diﬀering from a given reference language by not more then k

9

bits, in this case setting k to one bit. The results of the simulations of
bit-strings of lengths 8 and 16 are shown in ﬁg. 7; as in ﬁg. 2 above,
the simulations represent states of non-equilibrium, i.e., they were stopped
at some intermediate time and not let run until the distribution no longer
changed apart from random ﬂuctuations. These results are not very diﬀerent
from those shown in ﬁg. 2 for the 64 bits string in the hierarchical model.

5.3 More on Hamming distances

The above results were obtained by stopping the simulations at a suitable
time such that the results are closest to reality. In this section we report on
the equilibrium properties for longer times where the distributions no longer
change appreciably and where we will have either dominance of one language
or fragmentation of the whole population into many diﬀerent languages.

Fig. 8 nicely shows the phase transition between dominance at low and
fragmentation at high mutation rate p per bit-string when we vary the muta-
tion rate instead of ﬁxing it to only 0.0001 mutations per bit and per iteration.
For dominance, nearly everybody speaks one language, and most of the oth-
ers speak a language diﬀering in only one bit from this dominating language.
Fragmentation happens for larger mutation rates; then all possible languages
are represented about equally. We see in ﬁg. 8 that dominance is charac-
terized by a small average Hamming distance while for fragmentation the
average Hamming distance is about 1/2 (here it is normalized by the length
of the bit-string such that two random bit-strings have on average a distance
1/2.) This eﬀect is already seen if one looks only at the two largest languages
in the population, as done by Te¸sileanu and Meyer-Ortmanns (2006).

For fragmentation, the distribution of Hamming distances between two
pairs of speakers is roughly Gaussian (normal), shown by a parabola in the
semi-logarithmic plot (stars in ﬁg. 8). In the case of dominance, as observed
for two lower mutation rates p in ﬁg. 9, the most probable Hamming distance
is zero, and for higher distances the probability to observe them decays very
rapidly.

In these simulations we started with one language only and used the prob-
ability 1 −x2 for the shift from small to large languages. We got qualitatively
similar results when we started from a population fragmented into many lan-
guages, except that then the probability of a shift was set to (1 − x)2, to
allow for a possible transition from fragmentation to dominance.

10

6 Conclusion

The primary aim of our simulations was to capture, within one and the same
model, how two diﬀerent empirically observed distributions might arise, i.e. a
roughly log-normal distribution of language sizes and an approximate power-
law for the family sizes. With reasonable lengths of bit-strings, populations
and observation times we could, indeed, ﬁnd the two diﬀerent behaviours
in the same simulation. This suggests, contrary to the hypothesis of Wich-
mann (2005), that the present-day distribution of language family sizes in
combination with that of language sizes may not be unexpected.

In terms of simulation techniques the major contribution of the present
paper has been the introduction of new models into the area of linguistic
taxonomic dynamics, an area which, to our knowledge, has not previously
been investigated by means of computer simulations. The best results were
obtained in implementations of the hierarchical bitstring, a model which also
has the advantage of being versatile and easy to implement.

The investigations, however, also revealed some problems with the model.
If for a ﬁxed length of the bit-strings the population size N goes to inﬁnity,
then in the parameter region of fragmentation all possible languages will be
spoken, and all possible families will exist, making taxonomy a mathematical
triviality without connection to reality. Thus simulations of large but ﬁnite
populations, as presented here, may be better than mathematically exact so-
lutions for inﬁnite populations. Moreover, we did ﬁnd an eﬀective power-law
for the family size distribution, but that distribution decayed much faster
with increasing number of languages than the real distribution, shown ﬁg.
3. Thus future research should aim at also applying and testing other mod-
els, such as that of de Oliveira et al. (2006a,b), to problems of linguistic
taxonomic dynamic.

Figure 4: Time dependence of the distribution of language sizes, summed
over 100 samples at L = 32. For long times dominance of one language
develops, leading to an isolated peak at language sizes slightly below the total
population size. Only intermediate times give the desired roughly parabolic
shape. The same simulations were used for these language sizes as for the
family sizes in ﬁg. 1.

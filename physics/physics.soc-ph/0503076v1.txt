We propose improved methods to identify stock groups using the correlation matrix of stock price
changes. By ﬁltering out the market-wide eﬀect and the random noise, we construct the correla-
tion matrix of stock groups in which nontrivial high correlations between stocks are found. Using
the ﬁltered correlation matrix, we successfully identify the multiple stock groups without any extra
knowledge of the stocks by the optimization of the matrix representation and the percolation ap-
proach to the correlation-based network of stocks. These methods drastically reduce the ambiguities
while ﬁnding stock groups using the eigenvectors of the correlation matrix.

INTRODUCTION

The study of correlations in stock markets has at-
tracted much interest of physicists because of its chal-
lenging complexity as a complex system and its possible
future applications to the real markets [1]. In the early
years, a correlation-based taxonomy of stocks and stock
market indices was studied by the method of the hierar-
chical tree [2, 3]. Recently, the minimum spanning tree
technique was introduced to study the structure and dy-
namics of the stock network [4, 5, 6], the random matrix
theory was applied to ﬁnd out the diﬀerence between
the random and non-random property of the correlations
[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], and the studies have been extended
to the applications to the portfolio optimization in real
market [5, 9].

Commonly, the correlation between stocks is expressed

by the Pearson correlation coeﬃcient of log-returns,

Gi(t)

ln Si(t + ∆t)

where Si(t) is the price of stock i at time t. From real
time series data of N stock prices, we can calculate the

Laloux et al. [7] and Plerou et al. [8, 9] studied the
statistical properties of an empirical correlation matrix
between stock price changes deﬁned in Eq. (2) for real
markets. In comparison with the prediction of the ran-
dom matrix theory, they found that the statistics of the
bulk eigenvalues are in remarkable agreements with the
universal properties of the random correlation matrix.

For example, the bulk part of the eigenvalue spectrum
of the empirical correlation matrix for N stocks over L
price data is well ﬁtted by the spectrum of the random
correlation matrix [13] which is give by

sults from the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble of random
matrices [8, 9].

On the other hand, the non-random properties of the
correlation matrix have also been studied with the em-
pirical correlation matrix [8, 9, 10]. From the empirical
data for New York Stock Exchange, it was found that
each eigenvector corresponding to few largest eigenval-
ues larger than the upper bound of the bulk eigenvalue
spectrum is, localized , in a sense that only a few com-
ponents contribute to the eigenvector mostly, and the
stocks corresponding to those dominant components of
the eigenvector are found to belong to a common indus-
try sector. Very recently, Utsugi et al. conﬁrmed and
improved those results through the similar analysis for
the Tokyo Stock Exchange [12].

In order to conﬁrm the localization property of eigen-
vectors, we perform the similar analysis to the previous
studies [8, 9, 10] on eigenvectors of the correlation ma-
trix using our own dataset of stock prices. We analyze the
daily prices of N = 135 stocks belonging to the New York
Stock Exchange (NYSE) for the 20-yr period 1983
2003
5000 trading days) which is publicly available from
(L
the web-site(http://ﬁnance.yahoo.com) [14].
Indeed, if
we put stocks in the order of their industrial sectors, we
observe that the eigenvector components corresponding
to stocks which belong to speciﬁc industrial sectors give
high contributions to each of the eigenvectors for the few
largest eigenvalues [see Fig. 1]. For instance, the stocks
belonging to the Energy, Technology, Transportation,
and Utilities sectors highly contribute to the eigenvector
for the 2nd largest eigenvalue; the Energy sector consti-
tutes the big part of the eigenvector for the 3rd largest

eigenvalue; the 4th largest eigenvalue gives the eigen-
vector localized on the Basic Materials, Consumer(Non-
Cyclical), Healthcare, and Utilities sectors; the eigenvec-
tor for the 5th largest eigenvalue is also localized on sev-
eral speciﬁc industrial sectors.

However, it is not straightforward to ﬁnd out speciﬁc
stock groups, such as the industrial sectors, inversely. If
each of the eigenvectors had well-deﬁned dominant com-
ponents and the corresponding set of stocks were inde-
pendent of the sets from other eigenvectors, it would be-
come easy to identify the stock groups. Unfortunately,
in our study, it turns out that not only the set of eigen-
vector components with dominant contribution can be
hardly deﬁned in the eigenvector but also such a set is
likely to overlap with the sets from other eigenvectors un-
less we pick very small number of stocks with few highest
ranks of their contributions to the eigenvectors; Figure 1
indicates that each of eigenvectors is localized on multi-
ple number of industrial sectors and the corresponding
stocks severely overlap with those from the other eigen-
vectors. Therefore, it is very ambiguous to identify the
stock groups for practical purposes. The aim of this study

2

is to get rid of these ambiguities and ﬁnally ﬁnd out rel-
evant stock groups without any aid of the table of indus-
trial sectors.

In this paper, we introduce the improved method to
identify stock groups which drastically reduce the ambi-
guities in ﬁnding multiple groups using eigenvectors of
the correlation matrix. We ﬁrst ﬁlter out the random
noise and the market-wide eﬀect from the correlation ma-
trix. With the ﬁltered correlation matrix, we apply op-
timization and percolation approaches to ﬁnd the stock
groups. Through the optimization of the stock sequences
representing the matrix indices, the ﬁltered correlation
matrix is transformed into the block diagonal matrix in
which all stocks in a block are found to belong to the
same group. By constructing a network of stocks using
the percolation approach on the ﬁltered correlation ma-
trix, we also successfully identify the stock groups which
appear in the form of isolated clusters in the resulting
network.

This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, the de-
tailed ﬁltering method to construct the group correlation
matrix is given. For the ﬁltering, the largest eigenvalue
and the corresponding eigenvector are required and they
are calculated from the ﬁrst-order perturbation theory.
In Sec. III, detailed stock group ﬁnding methods using
the optimization and the percolation are given and the
resulting stock groups are speciﬁed. In Sec. IV, a sum-
mary and conclusions are presented.

II. GROUP CORRELATION MATRIX

A. Filtering

The group of stocks is deﬁned as a set of highly inter-
correlated stocks in their price changes. In the empirical
correlation matrix, because several types of noises are ex-
pected to coexist with the intra-group correlations, it is
essential to ﬁlter out such noises to isolate the intra-group
correlations which we are interested in. With the com-
plete set of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, the correlation
matrix in Eq.(2) can be expanded as

C =

N −1

α=0

α
λα|

α

(4)

where λα is the eigenvalue sorted in descending order
and
is the corresponding eigenvector. Because only
the eigenvectors corresponding to few largest eigenval-
ues are believed to contain the information on signiﬁcant
stock groups, we can identify a ﬁltered correlation matrix
for stock groups by choosing a partial sum of λα|

relevant to stock groups, which we will call the group
correlation matrix, Cg.

Taking it for granted that the eigenvalue spectrum
is characterized by market-wide, group, and random
parts [8, 9, 10], we separate the correlation matrix into

teristics in the distribution of the group correlation ma-
trix elements Cg
In Fig. 2(c), the distribution of Cg

has positive fat tail, which indicates that Cg contains
non-negligible number of strongly correlated stock pairs.
On the other hand, Cr, the summation over the bulk
eigenvalues, follows the Gaussian distribution which is
consistent with the prediction of the random matrix the-
ory [9]. The Gaussian-like distribution is also observed
partially in the distribution of Cg
ij , which indicates that
the random noise is not perfectly ﬁltered out. However,
it turns out that the remaining noise does not seriously
aﬀect to the identiﬁcation of stock groups. The distribu-
ij shows that Cm also contains highly correlated
tion of Cm
stock pairs, but we found that Cm
ij have to be ﬁltered out
for the clear identiﬁcation of the stock groups, which is
discussed in Section II B.

B. Largest eigenvalue and corresponding
eigenvector

Our ﬁltering is based on the following interpretations
of the previous studies: the bulk part of the eigenvalues
and their eigenvectors are expected to show the universal
properties of the random matrix theory and the largest
eigenvalue and its eigenvector are considered as a col-
lective response of the entire market [8, 9, 10]. While
the random characteristics of the bulk eigenvalues have
been studied intensively, only the empirical tests have
been done for the largest eigenvalue and its eigenvector
so far [9, 10]. Thus, to understand the more accurate
meaning, we introduce a model to calculate the largest
eigenvalue and its eigenvector of the correlation matrix
by using perturbation theory.

In stock markets, it has been understood that there
exist 3 kinds of ﬂuctuations in stock price changes:
a market-wide ﬂuctuation, synchronized ﬂuctuations of
stock groups, and a random ﬂuctuation [8, 9, 10]. For
the simplicity, we consider a situation in which a system
with only the market-wide ﬂuctuation is perturbed by
other ﬂuctuations. Let us assume that the price changes
of the all stocks in the market ﬁnd a synchronized back-
ground ﬂuctuation with zero mean and variance c0 as a
market-wide eﬀect. Then, we can write down the N
N
unperturbed correlation matrix as

tion matrix becomes

C = C0 + ∆,

(8)

where ∆ii = 0 and ∆ij = ∆ji. Applying the perturba-
tion theory up to the ﬁrst order, the largest eigenvalue
and the corresponding eigenvector components are easily
calculated as

We check the validity of the Eqs. (9) by comparing with
the largest eigenvector obtained from the numerical diag-
onalization of the empirical correlation matrix. For the
comparison, we make the distribution of Cij in Eq. (8)
to be close to the empirical Cij distribution by assuming

that ∆ij follows the bell-shaped distribution with zero
mean and letting c0 to the mean value of the empirical
Cij . Because the assumption not only reproduces the dis-
tribution of empirical Cij, but also allows us to neglect
1/N
∆ij term in Eqs. (9), we can directly compare the
perturbation theory with the numerical result. Figure 3
displays the eigenvector components of the largest eigen-
value obtained from the empirical correlation matrix and
the dominant terms of Eqs. (9), which show remarkable
agreement with each other.

·P

Eq. (9) indicates that the eigenvector of the largest
eigenvalue is contributed by not only the global ﬂuctu-
ation but also the unknown perturbations from ∆ in-
cluding random noises. Thus, by ﬁltering out Cm term,
we can decrease the eﬀect of unnecessary perturbations
in constructing the group correlation matrix. Indeed, as
seen in Fig. 2(c), because the heavy tail part of Cg, the
highly correlated elements, are buried in Cm, the clus-
tering of stocks would be seriously disturbed unless Cm
is ﬁltered out.

In addition, Eqs. (9) also enable us to interpret more
detailed meaning of the eigenvector than the market-
wide eﬀect. Because the ith eigenvector component ui is
mostly determined by wi, the sum of the correlation over
all the other stocks, it can be regarded as the inﬂuencing
power of the company in the entire stock market. In real
data, the top 4 stocks with highest wi are found to be
General Electric (GE), American Express (AXP), Merrill
Lynch (MER), and Emerson Electric (EMR), mostly con-
glomerates or huge ﬁnancial companies, which convinces
us that ui is indeed representing the inﬂuencing power
of stock i. However, these high inﬂuencing companies
prevent clear clustering of stocks because of their non-

4

negligible correlations with entire stocks in the market.
This is easily comprehensible by considering an analogous
situation in a network where the big hub, node with large
number of links, can make indispensable connections be-
tween groups of nodes to cause diﬃculties in distinguish-
ing the groups [16]. Therefore, it is very important to
ﬁlter out Cm in order to identify the groups of stocks
eﬃciently.

III.

IDENTIFICATION OF STOCK GROUPS

In the group model for stock price correlation proposed
by Noh [17], the correlation matrix C takes the form of
C = Cg + Cr, where Cg and Cr are the correlation
matrix of stock groups and random correlation matrix,
respectively. The model assumes the ideal situation with
Cg
ij = δαi,αj , where αi indicates the group to which the
stock i belongs. Thus, Cg is the block diagonal matrix,

Cg =



where 1i is the Ni×
in the i-th group) of which all elements are 1.

Ni matrix (Ni is the number of stocks

Here we use this group model to ﬁnd the groups of
stocks. If the correlation matrix in the real market can
be represented by the block diagonal matrix as in the
model, it would be very easy to identify the groups of
stocks. However, there exist inﬁnitely many possible rep-
resentations of the matrix depending on indexing of rows
and columns even if we have a matrix equivalent to the
block diagonal matrix. For instance, if we exchange the
indices of the matrix (e.g.
) the ma-
{
trix may not be block-diagonal anymore. Therefore, the
problem in identifying the groups in stock correlation ma-
trix requires to ﬁnd out the optimized sequence of stocks
to transform the matrix into the well-organized block di-
agonal matrix.

} → {

k, i, j

i, j, k

}

To optimize the sequence of stocks for clear block di-
agonalization, we consider the correlation between two
stocks as an attraction force between them. For the ideal
group correlation matrix in the group model, the block
diagonal form is evidently the most stable form if the
attractive force between stocks is proportional to their
correlation within the group. To deal with the real cor-
relation matrix, we deﬁne the total energy for a stock
sequence as

(11)

where li is the location of the stock i in the new index
sequence and the cutoﬀ cc = 0.1 is introduced to get rid
of the random noise part which still remains in Cg in
spite of the ﬁltering [18].

lists the optimized sequence of stocks. The multiple in-
dependent blocks of highly correlated correlations in the
matrix are clearly visible without any a priori knowledge
of stocks, i.e., the stocks in diﬀerent blocks are believed to
belong to diﬀerent groups. We succeed to identify about
70% of the entire 135 stocks from the blocks, which are
listed in Table I and it turns out that most of the stocks
in a block are represented by a single industry sectors or
a detailed industrial classiﬁcation such as Aerospace and
Defense, Airline Transport, Railroad, and Insurance [see
Fig. 4]. There still remain small number of ungrouped
stocks, which arises from the fact that the correlations
between them is too weak to be distinguished from the
random noise that still exists in the group correlation
matrix.

FIG. 5: The dependence of the number of isolated clusters,
m, in the stock network on the threshold p in constructing
the network from (a) the group correlation matrix and (b)
the full correlation matrix.

As an alternative method, we also perform a network-
based approach to ﬁnd the groups of stocks. In principle,
the correlation matrix can be treated as an adjacency
matrix of the weighted network of stocks, in which the
weights indicate how closely correlated the stocks are in
their price changes [21]. However, for the simplicity and
the clear deﬁnition of groups in the network, we consider
the binary network of stocks which permits only two pos-
sible states of a stock pair, connected or disconnected.

To construct the binary network of stocks, we use the
percolation approach because of its usefulness of ﬁnd-
ing groups. The method is very simple:
for each pair
of stocks, we connect them if the group correlation coef-
ﬁcient Cg
ij is larger than a pre-assigned threshold value
p. If the heavy tail in the distribution of Cg
ij in Fig. 2
mostly comes from the correlation between the stocks in
the same group, an appropriate choice of p = pc will
give several meaningful isolated clusters, m, in the net-
work which are expected to be identiﬁed as diﬀerent stock
groups.

We determine pc by observing the change of the net-
work structure as p decreases. Figure 5(a) displays the
number of isolated clusters in the network as a function
of threshold p. As we decrease p, the number of isolated
clusters in the network increases slowly and stays near
the maximum value up to p = 0.1, and then it abruptly
decreases to 1, which indicates there exists only one iso-
lated cluster. Therefore, we choose pc = 0.1 to construct
the most clustered but stable stock network [22].

We ﬁnd that the constructed network consists of sepa-
rable groups of stocks which correspond to the industrial
sectors of stocks [see Fig. 6]. At pc = 0.1, the network has
92 nodes and 357 links. The identiﬁcation of stock group
is very clear because the clusters in the network, which we

ever, although most of the stock groups are represented
by a single industrial sector, it is found that the stocks
which belong to two diﬀerent industrial sectors coexist
in a cluster. For instance, the stocks in the Healthcare
sector and the Non-Cyclical Consumer sector cannot be
separable in this network. Indeed, in Fig. 4, one can ob-
serve non-negligible correlation between the Healthcare
and the Non-Cyclical Consumer.

their pioneering achievements to reveal the localization
properties of eigenvectors, the classiﬁcation of stocks into
groups was not so clear, and it only covered about 10%
of their stocks because they used only few highest contri-
butions of eigenvector components due to the ambiguity
explained in Section I. In this work, we not only intro-
duce more reﬁned and systematic method to identify the
stock groups, but also successfully cluster about 70% of
stocks into groups although direct comparison of the suc-
cess ratio might be inappropriate because our data set is
diﬀerent from theirs.

On the other hand, Onnela et al. [6] introduced the
percolation approach to construct the stock network in
which the links are added between stocks one by one in
descending order from the highest element of the full cor-
relation matrix. In their work, though highly correlated
groups of stocks were found, the threshold value of the
correlation to settle the network structure was hardly
determined; the number of isolated clusters according to
the threshold did not show the clear cut. We believe
that this is attributed to the fact that they used the
full correlation matrix carrying market-wide and random

ﬂuctuation. We would also fail to determine the critical
threshold value of correlation if we use the full correlation
matrix instead of the ﬁltered one [see Fig. 5(b)]. This in-
dicates that the ﬁltering is crucial for the stock group
identiﬁcation.

IV. CONCLUSION

In conclusion, we successfully identify the multiple
group of stocks from the empirical correlation matrix of
stock price changes in New York Stock Exchange. We
propose reﬁned methods to ﬁnd stock groups which dra-
matically reduce ambiguities as compared to identifying
stock groups from the localization in a single eigenvector
of the correlation matrix [9, 10, 12]. From the analysis
of the characteristics of eigenvectors, we construct the
group correlation matrix of the stock groups excluding
the market-wide eﬀect and random noise. By optimiz-
ing the representation of the group correlation matrix,
we ﬁnd that the group correlation matrix is represented
by the block diagonal matrix where the stocks in each
block belong to the same group. This coincides with the
theoretical model of Noh [17]. Equally good stock group
identiﬁcation is also achieved by the percolation approach
on the group correlation matrix to construct the network
of stocks.

[14] Our selection of stocks covers most available stock price
data for the period 1983 − 2003 in the database. We
use the adjusted daily stock prices and skip ±1 days
of the data when splits and the dividends of any stock
occur in Eq. (1) and (2) to avoid the possible ar-
tifact caused by the abrupt stock price changes [see
http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/ﬁn/quote/index.html].

[15] It is not very clear to determine the upper bound of bulk
eigenvalue spectrum (Ng), but our main result does not
depend on the value of Ng as long as Ng is near the upper
bound of the bulk part.

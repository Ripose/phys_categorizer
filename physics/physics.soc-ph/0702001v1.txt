Abstract

We study the betweenness centrality of fractal and non-fractal scale-free network models as well

as real networks. We show that the correlation between degree and betweenness centrality C of

nodes is much weaker in fractal networks compared to non-fractal networks. We show that nodes of

both fractal and non-fractal scale-free networks have power law betweenness centrality distribution
P (C) ∼ C −δ. We ﬁnd that for non-fractal scale-free networks δ = 2, and for fractal scale-free

networks δ = 2 − 1/dB, where dB is the dimension of the fractal network. We also study the

crossover phenomenon from fractal to non-fractal networks upon adding random edges to a fractal
network. We show that the crossover length ℓ∗, separating fractal and non-fractal regimes, scales
with dimension dB of the network as p−1/dB , where p is the density of random edges added to the

network. We ﬁnd that the correlation between degree and betweenness centrality increases with

p. We test the new results by explicit calculations on four real networks: pharmaceutical ﬁrms

(N = 6776), yeast(N = 1458), WWW (N = 2526), and a sample of Internet network at AS level

(N = 20566), where N is the number of nodes in the largest connected component of a network.

INTRODUCTION

Studies of complex networks have recently attracted much attention in diverse areas of

science [1, 2, 3, 4]. Many real-world systems can be usefully described in the language of

networks or graphs, as sets of nodes connected by edges [5, 6]. Although diﬀerent in nature

many networks are found to possess common properties. Many networks are known to have

a “small-world” property [7, 8, 9, 10]: despite their large size, the shortest path between any

two nodes is very small. Additionally, many networks are scale-free (SF) [1, 2, 3, 4, 11, 12],
having a power-law tail in degree distribution, P (k) ∼ k−λ, where k is the number of links

per node.

Many networks, such as the WWW and biological networks have self-similar properties

and are fractals [13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. The box-counting algorithm [18] allows to calculate

their fractal dimensions dB from the box-counting relation

NB ∼ ℓ

−dB
B ,

(1)

where NB is the minimum number of boxes of size ℓB needed to cover the entire network

(Appendix B). Structural analysis of fractal networks shows that the emergence of SF fractal

networks is mainly due to disassortativity or repulsion between hubs [14]. That is, nodes of

large degree (hubs) tend to connect to nodes of small degree, giving life to the paradigm “the

rich get richer but at the expense of the poor.” To incorporate this feature, a growth model

of SF fractal networks that combines a renormalization growth approach with repulsion

between hubs has been introduced [14].

It has also been noted [14] that the traditional

measure of assortativity of networks, the Pearson coeﬃcient r [19] fails to distinguish between

fractal and non-fractal network since it is not invariant under renormalization.

Here, we study properties of fractal and non-fractal networks, including both models

and real networks. We focus on one important characteristic of networks, the betweenness

centrality (C) [20, 21, 22, 23],

C(i) ≡

σj,k(i)
σj,k

,

X
j,k

(2)

where σj,k(i) is the number of shortest paths between nodes j and k that pass node i and

σj,k is the total number of shortest paths between nodes j and k.

The betweenness centrality of a node is proportional to the number of shortest paths

that go through it. Since transport is more eﬃcient along shortest paths, nodes of high

2

betweenness centrality C are important for transport. If they are blocked, transport becomes

less eﬃcient. On the other hand, if the capacitance of high C nodes is improved, transport

becomes signiﬁcantly better [24].

Here we show that fractal networks possess much lower correlation between betweenness

centrality and degree of a node compared to non-fractal networks. We ﬁnd that in fractal

networks even small degree nodes can have very large betweenness centrality while in non-

fractal networks large betweenness centrality is mainly attributed to large degree nodes. We

also show that the betweenness centrality distribution in SF fractal networks obeys a power

law. We study the eﬀect of adding random edges to fractal networks. We ﬁnd that adding

a small number of random edges to fractal networks signiﬁcantly decreases the betweenness

centrality of small degree nodes. However, adding random edges to non-fractal networks has

a smaller eﬀect on the betweenness centrality.

We also analyze the transition from fractal to non-fractal networks and show both ana-
lytically and numerically that there exists a crossover length ℓ∗ such that for length scales
ℓ < ℓ∗ the topology of the network is fractal while for ℓ > ℓ∗ it is non-fractal. The crossover
length scales as ℓ∗ ∼ p−1/dB , where p is the number of random edges per node. We analyze

seven SF model networks and four real networks.

The four real networks we analyze are the network of pharmaceutical ﬁrms [25] , an

Internet sample at the AS level taken from the DIMES project [26] , PIN network of yeast

[27, 28] and WWW network of University of Western Sydney [29]. Pharmaceutical network

is the network of pharmaceutical ﬁrms around the world in which the links are the contracts

between the ﬁrms. The Internet network we analyze represents a sample of the internet

structure at the Autonomous Systems(AS) level. The Protein Interaction Network (PIN) of

yeast represents proteins as nodes and interactions between them as links between nodes.

The WWW network of University of Western Sydney represents web pages targeted by links

from the uws.edu.au domain. Basic properties of the considered networks are summarized

in Table.B

The rest of the manuscript is organized as follows: In section II, we study correlation

between the betweenness centrality and degree of nodes, and we compare fractal and non-

fractal networks. We analyze the betweenness centrality variance σC(k) of nodes of the same

degree k and introduce a correlation coeﬃcient R that describes the strength of betweenness

centrality degree correlation. We also analyze the betweenness centrality distribution P (C)

3

of several model and real networks. In section III we study the transition from fractal to

non-fractal networks with randomly added edges. Appendix A provides a short summary of

the fractal growth model introduced in [14]. Appendix B discusses the box covering method

and its approximations.

WORKS

II. BETWEENNESS CENTRALITY OF FRACTAL AND NON-FRACTAL NET-

It is generally accepted [30] that in many networks nodes having a larger degree also

have a larger betweenness centrality. Indeed, the larger the degree of a node, the larger the

chance that many of the shortest paths will pass through this node; the chance of many

shortest paths passing a low degree node is presumably small. Here we show that this is

not the case for fractal SF networks. As seen in Fig. 1(a) small degree nodes in fractal SF

networks have a broad range of betweenness centrality values. The betweenness centrality

of many small degree nodes can be comparable to that of the largest hubs of the network.

For non-fractal networks, on the other hand, degree and betweenness centrality of nodes are

strongly correlated.

To demonstrate the diﬀerence in the relation between degree and betweenness centrality in

real networks we compare original networks with their random (uncorrelated) counterparts.

We construct the random counterpart network by rewiring the edges of the original network,

yet preserving the degrees of the nodes and enforcing its connectivity. As a result we obtain

a random network with the same degree distribution which is always non-fractal regardless

of the original network. As seen in Fig. 1(b),the betweenness centrality-degree correlation

of a random network obtained by rewiring edges of the WWW network is much stronger

compared to that of the original network. Ranges of betweenness centrality values for a

given degree decrease signiﬁcantly as we randomly rewire edges of a fractal SF network.

The quantitative description of the betweenness centrality - degree correlation can be

given by the analysis of the betweenness centrality variance σC(k) attributed to nodes of

the speciﬁc degree k. Larger value of the variance σC(k) means weaker correlation between

degree and betweenness centrality of a node since nodes of the same degree have larger

variations in betweenness centrality values. As seen in Fig. 2, in a region of small degree,

betweenness centrality variance σC(k) of fractal networks is signiﬁcantly bigger than that

4

of their respective randomly rewired counterparts which are not fractals. At the same time

betweenness centrality variance of non-fractal networks is comparable or even smaller than

that of the corresponding randomly rewired networks. Thus, the betweenness centrality

of nodes of fractal networks is signiﬁcantly less correlated with degree than in non-fractal

networks.

This can be understood as a result of the repulsion between hubs found in fractals [14]:

large degree nodes prefer to connect to nodes of small degree and not to each other. There-

fore, the shortest path between two nodes must necessarily pass small degree nodes which

are found at all scales of a network. Thus, in fractal networks small degree nodes have a

broad range of values of betweenness centrality while in non-fractal networks nodes of small

degree generally have small betweenness centrality. Betweenness centralities of small degree

nodes in fractal networks signiﬁcantly decrease after random rewiring since the rewired net-

work is no longer fractal. On the other hand, centralities of nodes in non-fractal networks

either do not change or increase after rewiring of edges.

To characterize and quantify the overall betweenness centrality - degree correlation we

propose a correlation coeﬃcient:

R = Pk σC(k) ∗ p(k)
C(k) ∗ p(k)

Pk σ∗

,

where σC(k) and σ∗

C(k) are the betweenness centrality variances of the original and ran-
domly rewired networks respectively and p(k) is the degree distribution of both networks.

The coeﬃcient R is the ratio between the mean variance < σC(k) > of the original network
and < σ∗

C(k) >, that of the randomly rewired network. We note that fractal SF networks
have bigger values of the betweenness centrality variance than their randomly rewired coun-

terparts and therefore, have correlation coeﬃcient R > 1. On the other hand σC(k) of the
non-fractal SF networks is close or small er than that of their random counterparts σ∗

C(k)
which result in values of the correlation coeﬃcient R ≈ 1 or R < 1. The calculated values of

the correlation coeﬃcient R for the networks we are considering throughout the paper are

outlined in Table.B.

The probability density function (pdf) of betweenness centrality has been studied for both

Erd¨os R´enyi [5, 6] and SF [11] networks. It was found that for SF networks the betweenness

centrality distribution satisﬁes a power law

(3)

(4)

P (C) ∼ C −δ,

5

with typical values of δ between 1 and 2 [31, 32, 33]. Our studies of the betweenness centrality

distribution support these earlier results (Fig. 3). We ﬁnd that δ increases with dimension dB

of analyzed fractal networks. In the case of non-fractal networks, where dB = ∞, estimated

values of δ seem to be close to 2.

An analytic expression for δ can be derived by using arguments similar to those used

in [33] to ﬁnd δ for the minimum spanning tree (MST). Consider a fractal tree network

of dimension dB. A small region of the network consisting of n nodes will have a typical
diameter ℓ(n) ∼ n1/dB [34]. Nodes in this region will be connected to the rest of the network

via ℓ(n) nodes. Thus, the betweenness centrality of those nodes is at least n. Since the

number of regions of size n is N/n, the total number of nodes with betweenness centrality

C > n in the network is

Thus, the number of links with betweenness centrality n is

φ(n) ∼ ℓ(n)

∼ n1/dB −1.

N
n

∆φ ∼ φ(n + 1) − φ(n) ∼ n1/dB −2.

Using Eq. (4) we immediately obtain

δ = 2 −

1
dB

.

(5)

(6)

(7)

Thus, Eq. (7) shows that δ increases with dB in agreement with Fig. 3. For non-fractal

networks dB → ∞ and δ = 2. So non-fractal networks consist of relatively small number

of central nodes and a large number of leaves connected to them. On the other hand in

fractal networks, especially in those of small dimensionality, due to the repulsion between

hubs, betweenness centrality is distributed among all nodes of a network. Analysis of the

box covering method as a fractal test for some fractal and non-fractal networks studied here

is shown in Fig. 4.

III. CROSSOVER SCALING IN FRACTAL NETWORKS

We now study the behavior of fractal and non-fractal networks upon adding random noise.

We analyze the change in the structure of networks as we add edges between randomly chosen

6

nodes. A quantitative description of this eﬀect is obtained by measuring the strength of the

betweenness centrality-degree correlation

Vk ≡

σC,k
hCki

(8)

for nodes of the degree k, where hCki and σC,k are respectively the average betweenness

centrality and the betweenness centrality standard deviation of nodes with degree k. Fig. 5

shows results for Vk for both fractal and non-fractal models and real networks. We observe

a substantial diﬀerence in the behavior of the variation coeﬃcient Vk upon adding random

edges. Vk corresponding to small degree nodes decreases in the case of fractal networks. On

the other hand, Vk seems to remain constant or increase in non-fractal networks. Fractal net-

works, as discussed above, have a weaker betweenness centrality-degree correlation. Adding

extra random edges makes fractal networks non-fractal and more homogeneous, which in-

creases the correlation. Thus, Vk is decreasing as more random edges are added. However,

adding random edges to non-fractal networks almost does not change Vk.

Next we analyze how the fractal network becomes non-fractal when random edges are

added. To this end, we study the minimal number of boxes NB of size ℓB needed to cover

the network as a function of ℓB as we add random edges to the network. Fig. 6(a) and 6(b)

shows that the dimension dB of the networks does not change. However, the network remains
fractal with NB ∼ ℓ−dB only at length scales ℓ below ℓ∗, a characteristic length which depends

on p. The network with added random edges behaves as non-fractal with exponential decay
NB ∼ exp(−ℓ/ℓ∗) for length scales ℓ above ℓ∗. The crossover length ℓ∗ separating the fractal

and non-fractal regions decreases as we add more edges [see Figs. 6(a) and 6(b)]. We employ

a scaling approach to deduce the functional dependence of the crossover length on the density

of added shortcuts p. We propose for NB the scaling ansatz

where

NB(ℓ, p) ∼ ℓ∗(p)−dB F (

ℓ
ℓ∗(p)

),

u−dB

u ≪ 1

exp(−u)

u ≫ 1.

F (u) ∼






With appropriate rescaling we can collapse all the values of NB(ℓ, p) onto a single curve [see
Figs. 6(c) and 6(d)]. The crossover length ℓ∗(p) exhibits a clear power law dependence on

(9)

(10)

the density of random shortcuts [Fig. 6(e)],

We next argue that asymptotically for large N,

ℓ∗(p) ∼ p−τ .

τ = 1/dB.

(11)

(12)

When a fractal network with N nodes and E edges has ∆ ≪ N random edges, the probability

of the given node i to have a random link is Pi = 2∆/N. The mass of the cluster of size
ℓC grown in a fractal network is MC ∼ ℓdf
edge is P = (2∆/N)MC. Thus, at distances ℓC for which (2∆/N)MC ≪ 1 we are in the

C . The probability of MC(ℓC) possessing a random

fractal regime. On the other hand, large distances ℓC for which (2∆/N)MC ≫ 1 correspond
to the non-fractal regime. Thus, the crossover length ℓ∗ corresponds to (2∆/N)MC(ℓ∗) ∼ 1,
which implies ℓ∗ ∼ ∆−1/dB or ℓ∗ ∼ p−1/dB , where p ≡ ∆/N. Note that the obtained values,

τ = 0.46 (dB = 1.9) and τ = 0.39 (dB = 2.3), are slightly smaller then the expected

asymptotic values, which we attribute as likely to be due to ﬁnite size eﬀects.

IV. DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY

We have shown that node betweenness centrality and node degree are signiﬁcantly less

correlated in fractal SF networks than in non-fractal SF networks due to the eﬀect of repul-

sion between the hubs. Betweenness centrality distribution in SF networks obeys a power
law P (C) ∼ C −δ. We derived an analytic expression for the betweenness centrality distri-

bution exponent δ = 2 − 1/dB for SF fractal trees. Hence, fractal networks with smaller

dimension dB have more nodes with higher betweenness centrality compared to networks

with larger dB. The transition from fractal to non-fractal behavior was studied by adding

random edges to the fractal network. We observed a crossover from fractal to non-fractal
regimes at a crossover length ℓ∗. We found both analytically and numerically that ℓ∗ scales
with density of random edges p as ℓ∗ ∼ p−τ with τ = 1/dB.

APPENDIX A: A FRACTAL GROWTH MODEL

A growth model of fractal SF networks was ﬁrst introduced by Song et al. [14]. In the

core of the growth model lies the network renormalization technique [13, 14]: A network is

covered with NB boxes of size ℓB. Subsequently, each of the boxes is replaced by a node to

construct the renormalized network. The process is repeated until the network is reduced

to a single node. The fractal growth model represents the inverse of this renormalization

process. The growth process is controlled by three parameters: n, m and e so that:

N(t) = n ∗ N(t − 1)

ki(t) = m ∗ ki(t − 1),

(A1)

(A2)

where N(t) and ki(t) are, respectively, the number of nodes of the network and degree of

node i at time t. The parameter e is the probability of hub attraction e ≡ Ehubs/E. In the

present study we limit our consideration to two distinct types of models:

fractal (e = 0)

and non-fractal (e = 1). At each growth step we run through all existing nodes. With

probability e we increase the degree of a given node by attaching (m − 1)ki(t − 1) new nodes

(this corresponds to hub attraction). With probability 1−e we grow (m−1)ki(t−1)−1 nodes

using remaining node to repel hubs. Thus, the entire growth process can be summarized as

follows (see Fig. 7):

(1) Start with a single node

(2) Connect (m − 1)ki(t − 1) extra nodes to each node i to satisfy Eq. (A2). With

probability 1 − e use one of the new nodes to repel node i from the central node.

(3) Attach the remaining number of nodes to the network randomly to satisfy Eq. (A1).

(4) Repeat steps (2) and (3) for the desired number of generations g.

The networks constructed in this way are SF with

λ = 1 +

log n
log m

.

9

(A3)

Fractal networks have a ﬁnite dimension

dB =

log n
log 2

.

(A4)

For derivations of Eqs. (A3) and (A4) see e.g., Ref. [14].

Here we refer to network models using a set of numbers (g,n,m,e). For example, a

(4, 5, 3, 0) should read as a 4th generation (g = 4) fractal (e = 0) network with n = 5 and

m = 3. According to the above growth process for this example (4, 5, 3, 0), N = ng = 625,

E = N − 1 = 624, λ = 1 + log n/ log m = 2.46, and dB = log n/ log 2 = 2.32.

APPENDIX B: MODIFIED BOX COUNTING METHOD.

The box counting method is used to calculate the minimum number of boxes NB of size ℓB

needed to cover the entire network of N nodes. The size of the box ℓB imposes a constraint

on the number of nodes that can be covered: all nodes covered by the same box must be

connected and the shortest path between any two nodes in the box should not exceed ℓB.

The most crucial and time-consuming part of the method is to ﬁnd the minimum out of all

possible combinations of boxes. In the present study we use an approximate method that

allows to estimate the number of boxes rather fast.

(1) Choose a random node (seed) on the network.

(2) Mark a cluster of radius ℓB centered on the chosen node.

(3) Choose another seed on the unmarked part of the network.

(4) Repeat steps (2) and (3) until the entire network is covered. The total number of seeds

N ′ is an estimate of the required number of boxes NB.

We stress that the estimated number of clusters N ′ is always less than NB, the minimal

number of boxes needed to cover the entire network. Indeed, the shortest path between any

two seeds is greater then the size of the box ℓB. Thus, a box cannot contain more than one
seed, and in order to cover the whole network we need at least N ′ boxes.

Even though N ′ is always less or equal to NB, the estimate may be good or poor based

on the order we choose for the nodes. In order to improve the estimation we compute many
times N ′ (typically 100–1000) and choose the maximum of all N ′.

10

Figures 4(a) and 4(b) demonstrate the application of the modiﬁed box counting algorithm

to several fractal and non-fractal networks. According to Eq. (1), dimensions of the fractal

networks are obtained by calculating the slope of the NB(ℓB) function in log-log format. The

calculated dimensions are underestimated due to a ﬁnite size eﬀect of the analyzed networks.

Figure 4(c) represents dB as a function of the inverse number of generations g of the

model. As number of generations g increases calculated dimension dB approaches the value

given by Eq. (A4).

A similar algorithm was introduced in Ref. [16]. The authors of this algorithm stress that

it provides the same dimension of the network no matter how the boxes are chosen. In our

algorithm we intend to estimate not only the dimension of the network but also the number
of boxes. Thus, we are seeking the maximum N ′ out of many realizations.

number of edges, λ the degree distribution exponent (P (k) ∼ k−λ), dB is the fractal dimension and

R is the correlation coeﬃcient (3). The notation of model networks is explained in Appendix A. We

consider only the largest connected cluster of the network if the original network is disconnected.

(a) Betweenness centrality versus degree correlation proﬁles of fractal and non-fractal

network models. Note the broader range of betweenness centrality values of small degree nodes

of fractal network compared to that of the non-fractal network. (b) Betweenness centrality versus

degree correlation proﬁles of Uni Western Sydney WWW(fractal) network and its random coun-

terpart. The randomly rewired network is non-fractal. Betweenness centrality and degree are

correlated much stronger in nodes of the random rewired network.

FIG. 2: Betweenness centrality variance σC calculated for both original and rewired networks as

a function of node degree k. Every point of the plot corresponds to the betweenness centrality

variance calculated for nodes of the same degree k and normalized over the corresponding average

betweenness centrality value < C > of the original network. Each of the plots includes the value

of the betweenness centrality- degree correlation coeﬃcient R (3). Note, that small degree nodes

of fractal networks: fractal model 3f(a), yeast(c) and Uni Western Sydney WWW(e) have larger

variance of betweenness centrality than that of the randomly rewired counterpart which is non-

fractal. On the other hand, small degree nodes of the non-fractal networks: non-fractal model

3nf(b), pharmaceutical(d) and AS internet(f) have betweenness centrality variance comparable or

even smaller than that of their randomly rewired counterparts. As a result R > 1 for fractal

networks and R < 1 or R ≈ 1 for nonfractal networks. Thus, betweenness centrality correlation is
weaker in fractal networks than in non-fractals.15

FIG. 3: Betweenness centrality distributions of (a) Fractal model 3f and WWW network (fractal)

and (b) non-fractal model 3nf and pharmaceutical network (non-fractal). The data have been

binned logarithmically. Both fractal and non-fractal networks exhibit a range power-law between-
ness centrality distribution consistent with P (C) ∼ C −δ. The calculated betweenness centrality

distributions (data points) are in good agreement with analytically obtained formula δ = 2 − 1/dB

represented by the straight lines. In non-fractal networks δ → 2 which is consistent with dB → ∞.

FIG. 6: (a,b) Box-covering analysis of fractal models 1f and 2f with added random edges. Networks
remain fractal on length scales smaller than certain crossover length ℓ∗. Above ℓ∗ the networks
are no longer fractal. The crossover length ℓ∗ becomes smaller as we add more edges. (c,d) Data

collapse of NB(ℓ, p) for the two fractal models. Appropriate rescaling NB(ℓB) −→ a(p)NB(ℓB/b(p))

allows to collapse all the values of NB(l, p) onto a single curve. (e) The rescaling function b(p)

for fractal models 1f and 2f as a function of p shows a power law scaling of the crossover length
ℓ∗ ∼ p−τ . Calculated exponents are τ1 = 0.46 and τ2 = 0.39 respectively. Calculated values are

smaller than expected due to the ﬁnite size eﬀect.

FIG. 7: Constructing (a) non-fractal and (b) fractal networks with parameters n = 6, m = 3.

The key diﬀerence between a fractal and non-fractal model is “repulsion between hubs”. In fractal

networks nodes of large degree prefer to connect to those of small degree and not to nodes of large

degree.

Introductory remarks

1.1 Humans as social animals and herding

Humans are perhaps the most social animals of all and they shape their environment to their personal
and social needs. This statement is based on a growing body of research at the frontier between new
disciplines called neuro-economics, evolutionary psychology, cognitive science, and behavioral ﬁ-
nance. This body of evidence emphasizes the very human nature of human with its biases and
limitations, opposed to the previously prevailing view of rational economic agents optimizing their
decisions based on unlimited access to information and to computation resources.

In our own work, we have focused on perhaps the most robust trait of humans which has prob-
ably the most visible imprint in our social affairs: imitation and herding. Imitation has been docu-
mented in psychology and in neuro-sciences as one of the most evolved cognitive process, requiring
a developed cortex and sophisticated processing abilities. In short, we learn our basics and how to
adapt mostly by imitation all along our life. It seems that imitation has evolved as an evolutionary
advantageous trait, and may even have promoted the development of our anomalously large brain
(compared with other mammals). It is actually “rational” to imitate when lacking sufﬁcient time,
energy and information to take a decision based only on private information and processing, that
is..., most of the time. Imitation, in obvious or subtle forms, is a pervasive activity of humans. In
the modern business, economic and ﬁnancial worlds, the tendency for humans to imitate leads in its
strongest form to herding and to crowd effects.

Based on a theory of cooperative herding and imitation, we have shown that imitation leads
to positive feedbacks, that is, an action leads to consequences which themselves reinforce the ac-
tion and so on, leading to virtuous or vicious circles. We have formalized these ideas in a general
mathematical theory which has led to observable signature of herding, in the form of so-called log-
periodic power law acceleration of prices. A power law acceleration of prices reﬂects the positive
feedback mechanism. When present, log-periodicity takes into account the competition between
positive feedback (self-fulﬁlling sentiment), negative feedbacks (contrariant behavior and funda-
mental/value analysis) and inertia (everything takes time to adjust). We refer to the book [?] for a
general introduction, a synthesis and examples of applications.

1.2 Deﬁnition and mechanism for bubbles

The term “bubble” is widely used but rarely clearly deﬁned. Following Case and Shiller, the term
“bubble” refers to a situation in which excessive public expectations of future price increases cause
prices to be temporarily elevated. During a housing price bubble, homebuyers think that a home
that they would normally consider too expensive for them is now an acceptable purchase because
they will be compensated by signiﬁcant further price increases. They will not need to save as much
as they otherwise might, because they expect the increased value of their home to do the saving for
them. First-time homebuyers may also worry during a housing bubble that if they do not buy now,
they will not be able to afford a home later. Furthermore, the expectation of large price increases
may have a strong impact on demand if people think that home prices are very unlikely to fall, and

2

certainly not likely to fall for long, so that there is little perceived risk associated with an investment
in a home.

What is the origin of bubbles? In a nutshell, speculative bubbles are caused by “precipitating
factors” that change public opinion about markets or that have an immediate impact on demand,
and by “ampliﬁcation mechanisms” that take the form of price-to-price feedback [?]. A number of
fundamental factors can inﬂuence price movements in housing markets. On the demand side, demo-
graphics, income growth, employment growth, changes in ﬁnancing mechanisms or interest rates,
as well as changes in location characteristics such as accessibility, schools, or crime, to name a few,
have been shown to have effects. On the supply side, attention has been paid to construction costs,
the age of the housing stock, and the industrial organization of the housing market. The elasticity
of supply has been shown to be a key factor in the cyclical behavior of home prices. The cyclical
process that we observed in the 1980s in those cities experiencing boom-and-bust cycles was that
general economic expansion, best proxied by employment gains, drove demand up. In the short
run, those increases in demand encountered an inelastic supply of housing and developable land,
inventories of for-sale properties shrank, and vacancy declined. As a consequence, prices acceler-
ated. This provided an ampliﬁcation mechanism as it led buyers to anticipate further gains, and the
bubble was born. Once prices overshoot or supply catches up, inventories begin to rise, time on the
market increases, vacancy rises, and price increases slow, eventually encountering downward stick-
iness. The predominant story about home prices is always the prices themselves [?]; the feedback
from initial price increases to further price increases is a mechanism that ampliﬁes the effects of the
precipitating factors. If prices are going up rapidly, there is much word-of-mouth communication,
a hallmark of a bubble. The word of mouth can spread optimistic stories and thus help cause an
overreaction to other stories, such as stories about employment. The ampliﬁcation can also work
on the downside as well. Price decreases will generate publicity for negative stories about the city,
but downward stickiness is encountered initially.

2 Classiﬁcation of the 45 stocks

2.1

Identiﬁcation of close-to-exponential growth

One way to make this classiﬁcation objective is the following: I propose to ﬁt the log-price with a
linear ﬁt and a quadratic ﬁt:

ln[p(t)] = a + bt + ǫ1
ln[p(t)] = a + bt + ct2 + ǫ2

(1a)

(1b)

and test for the null hypothesis that c=0. Since the noise (residues) is not Gaussian, we cannot
use directly the Wilks likelihood ratio test (you can try but I believe that you will ﬁnd that c is always
non-zero which you may like... but I do not :-)) we need to perform a bootstrap by constructing
synthetic time series (C) Ln(price(t)) = a + b t + noise, where the noise is made of piece of residues
from the ﬁt of the data with formula (A). I propose to use pieces of length 1 month, 3 months and 6
months to obtain the probability distribution of the value c of the ﬁts of(C) with (B). Then, we can
assess the probability that the c-value obtained in ﬁtting the data with (B) is signiﬁcant, ie, 95of the
synthetics have smaller c’s.

2.2 Log-periodic oscillations

I propose a different classiﬁcation which emphasizes the importance of ﬁrst acceleration (non-
sustainable) and then the log-periodicity:

(A) clear LPPL with BOTH acceleration (upward curvature) and log-periodicity: representa-
tives are for instance ﬁgure 1 and ﬁgure 7, 8, 9 ,. etc. For instance, ﬁgure 22 (NTC) that you put in
Class 2, I would put it in class (A). The problem of the ﬁts may come from the fact that the early
time in 2003 may be in a different regime and our further analysis by scanning tstart (both abrupt
and smoothed method) will tell us).

(B) close-to-exponential growth (seen as close-to-linear in log-linear scale) with clear log-

periodicity

(C) deceleration (downward curvature) with clear log-periodicity (like ﬁgures 5 and 11)
(D) LPPL but with two few oscillations and too large tc to be reliable: requires conﬁrmation
by future evolution: examples are ﬁgures 10, 13, 27. This class should also contain the clear
acceleration in log-linear but bad LPPL ﬁt, for instance ﬁgure 28, 29, 30, 36, 37. 44 In particular,
ﬁgure 37 strikes me as having its tc controlled by the very last few points, which is bad. In general,
the use of log-periodicity is to reduce the sensitivity of the ﬁt to the last few points that the pure
power law ﬁt has. In ﬁgure 37, we see that this is not the case.

(E) all the other cases, which have none of the above patterns, such as exempliﬁed by ﬁgure 31

, 34, 35 which looks to me like a standard geometrical random walk.

2.3 The classiﬁcation of stocks

(A) clear LPPL with BOTH acceleration (upward curvature) and log-periodicity: representatives
are for instance ﬁgure 1 and ﬁgure 7, 8, 9 ,. etc. For instance, ﬁgure 22 (NTC) that you put in Class
2, I would put it in class (A). The problem of the ﬁts may come from the fact that the early time

4

in 2003 may be in a different regime and our further analysis by scanning tstart (both abrupt and
smoothed method) will tell us).

(B) close-to-exponential growth (seen as close-to-linear in log-linear scale) with clear log-

periodicity

(C) deceleration (downward curvature) with clear log-periodicity (like ﬁgures 5 and 11)
(D) LPPL but with two few oscillations and too large tc to be reliable: requires conﬁrmation
by future evolution: examples are ﬁgures 10, 13, 27. This class should also contain the clear

, 34, 35 which looks to me like a standard geometrical random walk.

Mathematical Appendix

The simplest mathematical equation capturing the positive feedback effect and herding is the power
law formula

I(t) = A + B|tc − t|m ,

(2)

where B < 0 and 0 < m < 1 or B > 0 and m < 1. Others cases do not qualify as a power law
acceleration. For B < 0 and 0 < m < 1 or B > 0 and m < 1, the trajectory of I(t) described by
(2) expresses the existence of an accelerating bubble, which is faster than exponential. This is taken
as one hallmark of the existence of a bubble.

Notice also that this formula expresses the existence of a singularity at time tc, which should
be interpreted as a change of regime (the mathematical singularity does not exist in reality and
is rounded off by so-called ﬁnite-size effects and the appearance of a large susceptibility to other
mechanisms). This critical time tc must be interpreted as the end of the bubble and the time where
the regime is transiting to another state through a crash or simply a plateau or a slowly moving
correction.

It is important to recognize that the power law regime is expected only relatively close to the
critical time tc, while other behaviors are expected far from tc. The simplest model is to consider
that, far from tc, the price follows an exponential growth with an approximately constant growth
rate µ:

I(t) = a + beµt .

A fuller description is thus to consider that formula (3) holds from the beginning of the time series
up to a cross-over time t∗, beyond which expression (2) takes over. Any given price trajectory
should thus be ﬁtted by (3) from some initial time tstart to time t∗ and then by (2) from t∗ to the end
of the time series. Technically, t∗ is known from the parameters a, b, µ, A, B, tc, m by the condition
of continuity of I(t) at t = t∗, that is, both formulas give the same value at t = t∗. We can further
determine one of the parameters a, b or µ by imposing a condition of differentiability at t∗, that is,
the ﬁrst time-derivative of I(t) is continuous at t∗. This approach is known in numerical analysis
as “asymptotic matching” [?].

A simpliﬁed description of such a cross-over between a standard exponential growth and the

power law super-exponential acceleration is obtained by using a more compact formulation [?]

I(t) = A + B tanh[(tc − t)/τ ]m ,

where tanh denotes the hyperbolic tangent function. This expression derives from a study [?] of the
transition from the non-critical to critical regime in rupture processes (of which bubbles and their
terminal singularity belong to). This expression has the virtue of providing automatically a smooth
transition between the exponential behavior (3) and the pure power law (2), since tanh[(tc−t)/τ ] ≈
(tc − t)/τ for tc − t < τ and tanh[(tc − t)/τ ] ≈ 1 − 2e2(t−tc )/τ for tc − t > τ . In this later case
tc − t > τ , expression (4) becomes of the form (3) with m = 1 and

(3)

(7)

a = A + B ,

b = −2Be

−2tc/τ ,

µ = 1/τ .

In contrast, for tc−t < τ , expression (4) becomes of the form (2) with the correspondence B/τ m →
B. Expression (4) has only ﬁve free parameters, in contrast with the model involving the cross-
over from (3) to (2) which has 7 free parameters (a, b, µ, A, B, tc, m while t∗ is determined by the
asymptotic matching). The pure power law formula (2) has 4 parameters while the exponential
law (3) has just 3 parameters. The problem with expression (4) is that it does not recover a pure
exponential growth even for tc − t > τ , when m 6= 1. Thus, expression (4) is limited in fully
describing a possible cross-over from a standard mild exponential growth and an super-exponential
power law acceleration. Our tests (not shown) ﬁnd that a ﬁt with model (4) retrieve the pure power
law model (2) with the same critical time tc and exponent m and the same root-mean-square residual
r.m.s. (the ﬁt adjusts the parameter τ to a very large value, ensuring that the ﬁt is always in the
regime tc − t ≪ τ so that the hyperbolic tangential model reduces to the pure power law model).
Thus, contrary to our initial hopes, this approach does not provide any additional insight.

Inspired by these tests, we could propose the following modiﬁed model

I(t) = a + beµt(tc − t)m .

It has 5 adjustable parameters, like model (4), but it seems more ﬂexible to describe the looked-for
cross-over: for large tc − t, the power law term (tc − t)m changes slowly, especially for 0 < m < 1
as is expected here; for small tc − t, the power law term changes a lot while the exponential term
is basically constant. But, this model is correct for a critical point only if m < 0 so that b > 0;
otherwise, if 0 < m < 1, b < 0 and for tc − t large, the exponential term which dominate does not
describe a growth but an exponentially accelerating decay. For 0 < m < 1, we thus need a different
formulation. We propose

I(t) = a + beµt + c(tc − t)m .

We have ﬁtted this formula to the data over the four periods 1983-Oct2004, 1991-Oct2004, 1983-
Mar2005, 1991-Mar2005 and, while the ﬁts are reasonable, the critical time tc is found to overshoot
to 2007-2008, which is a typical signature that the model is not predictive.

Abstract

We tested 45 indices and common stocks traded in the South African stock market for the
possible existence of a bubble over the period from Jan. 2003 to May 2006. A bubble is de-
ﬁned by a faster-than-exponential acceleration with signiﬁcant log-periodic oscillations.
The faster-than-exponential acceleration characteristics are tested with several different
metrics, including nonlinearity on the logarithm of the price and power law ﬁts. The log-
periodic properties are investigated in detail using the ﬁrst-order log-periodic power-law
(LPPL) formula, the parametric detrending method, the (H, q)-analysis, and the second-
order Weierstrass-type model, resulting in a consistent and robust estimation of the funda-
mental angular log-frequency ω1 = 7 ± 2, in reasonable agreement with previous estima-
tions on many other bubbles in developed and developing markets. Sensitivity tests of the
estimated critical times and of the angular log-frequency are performed by varying the ﬁrst
date and the last date of the stock price time series. These tests show that the estimated
parameters are robust. With the insight of 6 additional month of data since the analysis was
performed, we observe that many of the stocks on the South Africa market experienced an
abrupt drop mid-June 2006, which is compatible with the predicted tc for several of the
stocks, but not all. This suggests that the mini-crash that occurred around mid-June of 2006
was only a partial correction, which has resumed into a renewed bubbly acceleration bound
to end some times in 2007, similarly to what happened on the S&P500 US market from
Oct. 1997 to Aug. 1998.

1 Introduction

One of the most robust characteristics of humans, which has arguably the most
visible imprint in our social affairs, is imitation and herding. Imitation has been
documented in psychology and in neuro-sciences as one of the most evolved cog-
nitive process, requiring a developed cortex and sophisticated processing abilities.
In short, we learn our basics and how to adapt mostly by imitation all along our life.
It seems that imitation has evolved as an evolutionary advantageous trait, and may
even have promoted the development of our anomalously large brain (compared
with other mammals) [1]. It is actually “rational” to imitate when lacking sufﬁcient
time, energy and information to take a decision based only on private information
and processing, that is..., most of the time. Imitation, in obvious or subtle forms,
is a pervasive activity of humans. In the modern business, economic and ﬁnancial
worlds, the tendency for humans to imitate leads in its strongest form to herding
and to crowd effects [2].

Models of cooperative herding and imitation have been built on the notion that im-
itation leads to positive feedbacks, that is, an action leads to consequences which
themselves reinforce the action and so on, leading to virtuous or vicious circles.
We have formalized these ideas in the mathematical theory of rational expectation
bubbles in the presence of noisy imitative traders. The theory leads to observable
signatures of herding, in the form of so-called log-periodic power law (LPPL) ac-
celeration of prices. A power law acceleration of prices reﬂects the positive feed-
back mechanism. When present, log-periodicity takes into account the competition
between positive feedback (self-fulﬁlling sentiment), negative feedbacks (contrari-
ant behavior and fundamental/value analysis) and inertia (everything takes time to
adjust). Log-periodicity can also be interpreted as the signature of the developing
discrete hierarchy of alternating positive and negative feedbacks culminating in the
ﬁnal “rupture,” which is the end of the bubble often associated with a crash. We
refer to the book [2] for a general introduction, a synthesis of the models and ex-
amples of empirical tests and applications.

In a nutshell, the LPPL formulation is based on the following principles. Investors
in the stock market form a complex connected network and interact with each other
“locally” through transfer of information, leading to what we refer broadly as “imi-
tation.” Local interactions propagate spontaneously into global cooperation leading
to herding behaviors, which result in bubbles and antibubbles. These ingredients,
together with the fact that prices reﬂect the aggregate decisions of investors, is
formalized by a rational expectation model of bubbles with imitation between the
noisy traders [3,4,5]. The main consequence of the model is that the dynamics
may evolve towards (respectively away from) a critical point at a critical time tc
corresponding to the most probable end of the bubble (respectively most probable
beginning of the antibubble). The competition between nonlinear trend followers
and nonlinear value investors together with inertia between investor decisions and

2

their market impact may lead to additional nonlinear oscillations approximating
log-periodicity [6,7]. Log-periodicity may also result from or be ampliﬁed by the
presence of a naturally existing hierarchy of social group sizes [4,5,8].

Mathematically, the LPPL model is represented by the equation giving the antici-
pated expected trajectory of the log-price I(t) ≡ ln p(t) of a given asset as a func-
tion of time, expressed in terms of the distance τ = tc − t (respectively τ = t − tc)
to the critical time tc for bubbles (respectively for antibubbles):

I (t) = A + Bτ m + Cτ m cos [ω ln (τ ) − φ] .

(1)

A is the log-price at tc (since τ = 0 at t = tc, all the other terms are vanishing at
t = tc), B (respectively) controls the amplitude of the power law acceleration (re-
spectively the log-periodic component) of the log-price. The exponent m encodes
the structural shape of the acceleration. It is usually found between 0 and 1, which
ensures a ﬁnite price at tc together with an asymptotic inﬁnite rate of change close
to tc. The parameter ω is the log-periodic angular frequency of the log-periodic os-
cillations. It should be stressed that ω is not the inverse of a time scale, but rather
it is proportional to the inverse of the logarithm of a scale factor λ, where λ is
roughly speaking the ratio of the distances between successive peaks of the log-
periodic oscillations. Finally, the phase φ contains two ingredients: the information
on the mechanism of interactions between investors and a rescaling of time [9,10].

The organization of the paper is as follows. The next section 2 tests for the ex-
istence of faster-than-exponential acceleration in the price of the 45 stocks used
in this study. It also presents preliminary screening tests on the existence of log-
periodicity. Combining these evidences, section 2 ﬁnally qualiﬁes 5 assets out of
the 45 as exhibiting a signiﬁcant bubble regime. Then, section 3 presents a detailed
analysis of the log-periodic characteristics of these 5 assets, using four different
techniques. The estimations of the angular log-frequency ω’s are found consistent
and robust across the four methods. Section 4 presents a sensitivity analysis of the
critical time tc and of the angular log-frequency ω by varying both the starting time
as well as the ending time of the interval over which the ﬁts are performed. Section
5 summarizes and concludes with respect to the quality of the forecasts using tc as
the most probable time of the corrections associated with the end of the bubbles,
using the insight obtained from waiting an additional 6 months since the end of the
study in May 2006.

2 Classiﬁcation of potential speculative behavior among 45 representative

stocks on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange

One of the most advanced and productive economies in Africa, South Africa is
characterized by a developed ﬁrst world economic infrastructure and an emerg-

3

ing market economy. Its ﬁnancial market is organized by the Johannesburg Stock
Exchange (JSE) (http://www.jse.co.za/), which is the only securities exchange in
South Africa. It was ofﬁcially established on 8 November, 1887, and has now more
than 400 listed companies [11].

Our study is performed on a subset of 45 companies among the largest compa-
nies listed on the JSE, whose name and characteristics are available in tables 4-6 of
the extended version, only available online at http://arXiv.org/abs/physics/0701171.
The selection of these 45 companies is representative of the diversiﬁcation per-
formed by major investment banks and brokerage houses in South Africa, as com-
municated to us by one of the major brokerage house in South Africa. The daily
price series run from the ﬁrst trading day of January 2003 till May 2006.

2.1 Is there an acceleration?

Our ﬁrst goal is to perform a robust analysis of the the 45 ﬁnancial time series, to
identify those potential candidates for a bubble behavior. There is a large literature
on the empirical issue of identifying ﬁnancial bubbles (see [2,12] and references
therein). A key problem is that bubbles are usually deﬁned as exponentially ex-
plosive growth phases, but how can one then distinguish them from the growth of
a fundamental valuation process which is also generically expected to follow an
exponential growth path? Following [2,12], we address this problem by deﬁning a
bubble as a faster-than-exponential accelerating price, which we refer to as “super-
exponential.” Being faster than exponential, i.e., the growth rate is itself growing,
it is necessarily unsustainable if we assume a standard geometric growth for the
underlying economy. A super-exponential path can only be transient, reﬂecting var-
ious positive feedback processes that lead to reinforced growth.

Our goal is thus to contrast a standard exponential growth from a super-exponential
growth. The former is characterized by the logarithm of the price of a given asset
being linear in time as

(2)
ln[p(t)] = a + bt + ǫ1 ,
where ǫ1 is a short-hand notation for a random walk component. The parameter
b is then the rate of return for continuous compounding of the interests. Expres-
sion (2) is nothing but the integrated form of the standard geometrical random
walk model with drift. The arguably simplest extension (2) which gives super-
exponential growth is obtained as

ln[p(t)] = a + bt + ct2 + ǫ2 .

(3)

The null hypothesis is c = 0. If it is rejected with c > 0 at a sufﬁciently large
signiﬁcance level, we would conclude that the price process is growing super-
exponentially, qualifying a bubble regime. Since the residual is not Gaussian, we

4

cannot use directly the Wilks’ likelihood ratio test or t-test of signiﬁcance for the
coefﬁcient c. We rather use an approach in the spirit of the Akaike Information
Criterion (AIC), which amounts to test the two models by comparing [RMS1(i)]2
for model (2) with [RMS2(i)]2 + 2σ2 for model (3) [13]. The terms RMS1(i) and
RMS2(i) are the root-mean-square of the residuals of the ﬁts to the price time
series of asset i with model (2) and model (3) respectively. The term σ2 is the stan-
dard deviation of the noise of the price process. The term 2σ2 is the cost attributed
to model (3) for having one more adjustable parameter compared with model (2).
In other words, AIC not only rewards goodness of ﬁt, but also includes a penalty
linear in the number of estimated parameters. Then, the AIC qualiﬁes model (3) if
[RMS2(i)]2 + 2σ2 < [RMS1(i)]2. This is equivalent to

[RMS1(i)]2 − [RMS2(i)]2
[RMS1(i)]2

>

2σ2
[RMS1(i)]2 .

Since in practice, σ2 is not known to us, we calculate the the relative difference of
the improvement of the ﬁts resulting from the additional quadratic term in model
(3) in the left-hand-side of (4):

D(i) = [RMS1(i) − RMS2(i)]/RMS1(i) ,

for each asset. Then, the larger is the value of D(i), the more probable is the re-
jection of the null hypothesis and the relevance of the quadratic term qualifying a
bubble regime. Fig. 1 gives the 45 values of D(i) for all the 45 stocks.

quadratic term in model (3) in the left-hand-side of (4), as deﬁned by (5).

We disqualify stocks as not being in a bubble regime if they obey at least one of the
following criteria:

(1) D(i) 6 25%,

5

(2) the quadratic term is positive (c > 0),
(3) the overall price has been increasing from the beginning to the end of the

period.

This leads us to reject the following 27 stocks as not in a bubble regime from Jan.
2003 till May 2006: 3, 5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 21, 22, 24, 26, 27, 29, 30, 32, 33,
34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 44, 45. This selection is in line with visual inspection for
all except stock 30, for which the analysis comparing (2) and (3) has not enough
power. Indeed, in this case of stock 30, the weak improvement of model (3) may
be attributed to the combination of a large drawup followed by a large drawdown
from end-of-2003 to middle-of-2004 followed by an upward acceleration. We thus
keep this stock 30 for further analysis.

2.2 Log-periodic oscillations

As we just mentioned, the analysis comparing (2) and (3) is not claimed to have
universal absolute power: it may have not enough power to reject a stock when it
should have been rejected (error of type I or false positive), or it may reject a stock
that should be kept in the bubble class (error of type II or false negative) as we
argue is perhaps the case of stock 30.

It is thus useful to examine the results of another test, based on a speciﬁcation
which is well-adapted to test for the presence of super-exponential behavior, in the
possible presence of oscillatory intermittent ﬂuctuations. This speciﬁcation uses the
so-called log-periodic formula (1) introduced ﬁrst in [14,15] and expanded upon in
several subsequent papers (see for instance [2,16]. We have ﬁtted the 45 stock price
series with the log-periodic power-law formula (1) and obtained the key parameters
tc, m, and ω.

In the above characterization in terms of (2) versus (3), the non-accelerating log-
price was characterized essentially by the absence of a signiﬁcant positive quadratic
term ct2 in (3). In the present log-periodic power law analysis, a non-accelerating
log-price should be qualiﬁed by an exponent m close to 1, while an accelerating
log-price corresponds to m small or even negative. We ﬁnd that this correspondence
holds to a large degree, as seen from the following list: (3, 0.86), (5, 0.96), (9, 0.52),
(10, 0.86), (11, 0.84), (12, 0.58), (13, 0.84), (14, 2), (15, 0.71), (21, 0.27), (22, 1.6),
(24, 0.5),, (26, 1.6), (27, 1.8), (29, 0.99), (32, 1), (33, 0.63), (34, 0.41), (35, 0.84),
(36, 1.4), (37, 1.3), (38,-2), (39, 0.99), (41, 0.64), (44, 1.4), (45, 0.55). Here, the
ﬁrst number in each parenthesis stands for the stock number and the second one
is the value of the exponent m. For the stock prices which have been qualiﬁed as
non-accelerating by the method of the previous section, we ﬁnd large m-values,
conﬁrming the classiﬁcation. The following cases can be considered marginal:

(1) (9, 0.52), which has a relative RMS change D(9) ≈ 0.24 as deﬁned by (5),

6

(2) (12, 0.58), which has a relative RMS change D(12) ≈ 0.12,
(3) (21, 0.27), which has a relative RMS change D(21) ≈ 0.24,
(4) (24, 0.5), which has a relative RMS change D(24) of almost zero, while pre-

senting an intermediate m value,

(5) (34, 0.41), which has a relative RMS change D(34) = 0.18 and the accelera-
tion is more an abrupt change of slope or kink occuring in the ﬁrst quarter of
2005, and

(6) (38, -2), which exhibits a log-price which has decreased over most of the time

period and which should be rejected.

In addition to the value of the exponent m, the presence of log-periodicity has
been argued as a signature of a bubble regime [14,15]. The upper panel of Fig. 2
plots the value of the ﬁtted log-periodic angular frequency ω for the 45 analyzed
stocks. Previous studies on a large number of bubbles mostly on ﬁnancial indices,
bonds and currencies of many developed and emerging countries have shown that
the distribution of ω exhibits several peaks, the prominent one being on the so-
called fundamental log-periodic angular frequency ω1 ≈ 6.4 ± 1.5 [17], with other
peaks on its harmonics ωn = nω1. The importance of the high-order harmonics is
expected to decrease exponentially [18], but large amplitudes for the second-order
and third-order harmonics ω2 and ω3 have been observed to be sometimes very
signiﬁcant [19,20]. It thus seems difﬁcult to use here a ﬁlter based solely on ω, in
particular for individual stocks which are necessarily more noisy than aggregate
indices.

Our previous experience (in particular in [21]) suggests that log-periodicity is gen-
uine only if the number Nosc of oscillations is roughly 3 or more. Indeed, it has
been shown that multiplicative noise on a power law accelerating function leads
naturally to stochastic log-periodic oscillations with a most probable number equal
to Nosc ≈ 1.5 [22]. The tests of statistical signiﬁcance performed in [21] have
shown that, for most types of noise, three oscillations are in general sufﬁcient to
qualify a genuine oscillatory component. We thus complement the determination
of the angular log-frequency ω by the measure Nosc of log-periodic oscillations in
each of the 45 stock prices. Given a LPPL ﬁt and the obtained calibrated parameters
tc and ω, the number of oscillations is determined by

(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
where [tﬁrst, tlast] is the interval over which the LPPL ﬁtting is performed. The
variable Nosc for each of the 45 stocks is shown in the lower panel of Fig. 2.

One can observe that the two measures ω and Nosc provide consistent results. As
shown by the correspondence between the symbols in the upper and lower panel
of Fig. 2 for most of the stocks, large ω’s are associated with a large number of
oscillations and vice-versa. There are three exceptions to this observation: i = 13
(BVT), 31 (OML), and 43 (TBS), outlined in the ﬁgure by the arrows. Given the

large range of observed ω’s, we take the number Nosc of LPPL oscillations as the
more robust indicator of genuine log-periodicity. This leads to qualify the following
stocks as exhibiting a signiﬁcant log-periodicity: 1, 3, 4, 5, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,
19, 20, 21, 22, 27, 29, 30, 32, 33, 34, 36, 37, 41, 44, and 45.

Combining this with the results shown in Sec. 2.1, we are left with ﬁve stocks which
qualify as being in a bubble regime, deﬁned as a signiﬁcant super-exponential ac-
celeration with the presence of signiﬁcant log-periodicity: 1 (J203: an index), 4
(J580: an index), 19 (INL), 20 (INP), and 30 (NTC).

In the remaining of this paper, we analyze these ﬁve stocks extensively.

3 Analyzing the log-periodic structure of stocks 1 (J203), 4 (J580), 19 (INL),

20 (INP), and 30 (NTC)

3.1 First-order LPPL model

The ﬁts of the logarithms of the prices of the ﬁve stocks 1 (J203), 4 (J580), 19
(INL), 20 (INP), and 30 (NTC) by the log-periodic power law model (1) are shown

8

in Fig. 3 and the parameters are given in Table 1. The small value of the exponent m
(except for NTC) conﬁrms a clear super-exponential acceleration. The log-periodic
angular frequencies are found to be close to twice (J203, INL, INP, NTC) or four
times (J580) the value ω1 ≈ 6.4 ± 1.5 of the fundamental log-periodic angular
frequency found in many previous studies [17,12]. The LPPL ﬁts suggested at the
time of the ﬁts (end of May 2006) that the bubbles would end either immediately
(NTC) or during the second part of the year. We discuss this prediction below.

The detection of log-periodic oscillations, if any, is conveniently performed by
removing the global trend of the price of a given stock. One way is to subtract
the power law trend from the price and then to analyze the wobbles of the ob-
tained residuals s(t) by an adequate spectral analysis [3]. We shall also use a non-
parametric approach called the (H, q)-analysis [23]. Since log-periodicity corre-
sponds to regular oscillations in the variable ln(t−tc), we use a Lomb periodogram
analysis which is well-adapted to the uneven sampling of the variable ln(t − tc)

9

[24]. A Lomb analysis also allows us to assess the statistical signiﬁcance level of
the extracted log-periodicity [24,21,25].

3.2 Parametric detrending approach

Following [3,4], the ﬁrst method of analysis of the log-periodicity consists in re-
moving the power law trend and then testing for a possible pure log-periodicity
without acceleration. We construct the residual s(t) in the following way

s(t) = [I(t) − A]/(t − tc)m .

(7)

This residual s(t) has a nonzero mean µs associated with the coefﬁcient B and a
given variance σ2
s (in general different from 1). The inset of Fig. 4 plots the stan-
dardized residuals [s(t)−µs]/σs as a function of ln τ = ln(t−tc) for the ﬁve stocks
1 (J203), 4 (J580), 19 (INL), 20 (INP), and 30 (NTC). The ﬁve Lomb periodograms
of these ﬁve residuals are presented in Fig. 4. Since PN (ω) is a normalized Lomb
power, s(t) and [s(t) − µs]/σs have identical Lomb periodogram. The angular log-
periodic frequencies associated with the highest Lomb peaks are respectively 15.1,
25.1, 15.0, 15.6, and 12.5, which are close to the values obtained with the para-
metric ﬁt with expression (1) listed in Table 1. Their statistical signiﬁcance is ex-
tremely high, much larger than 99%, for all possible noise processes, according to
the benchmarks developed in [21].

3.3 (H, q)-analysis

We have also performed a generalized q-analysis, called (H, q)-analysis [23,26],
on each of the logarithm of the ﬁve price trajectories. The (H, q)-analysis is a non-
parametric method for characterizing self-similar functions, which generalizes the

q-analysis [27,28]. The later is a natural tool for the description of discretely scale
invariant fractals. The (H, q)-derivative of a function I(τ ) is deﬁned as

DH

q I(τ )

△
=

I(τ ) − I(qτ )
[(1 − q)τ ]H .

(8)

The special case H = 1 recovers the standard q-derivative, which itself reduces
to the standard derivative in the limit q → 1−. There is no loss of generality by
constraining q in the open interval (0, 1) [23]. The advantage of the (H, q)-analysis
is that there is no need for detrending, as trends are automatically accounted for by
the ﬁnite difference and the normalization by the denominator upon a systematic
sweeping of the parameter H.

We apply the (H, q)-analysis to I(x) = ln p(t), where p(t) is the price of each
of the ﬁve stocks 1 (J203), 4 (J580), 19 (INL), 20 (INP), and 30 (NTC), as an
independent powerful test of log-periodicity. The independent variable is taken to
be ln τ [23]. The same method has been applied to test for log-periodicity in stock
market bubbles and antibubbles [29,26], in the USA foreign capital inﬂow bubble
ending in early 2001 [30], in the UK real estate bubble [31], in the Chinese stock
market antibubble [32], and in the US treasury bond yield antibubble [33].

We scan a 100 × 50 rectangular grid in the (H, q) plane, with H = −0.99 : 0.02 :
0.99 (from −0.99 to +0.99 with increment 0.02) and q = 0.01 : 0.02 : 0.99 (from
0.01 to 0.99 with increment 0.02). For each pair of (H, q) values, we calculate the
(H, q)-derivative (8), on which we perform a Lomb analysis. The highest Lomb
peak of the resulting periodogram has height PN and abscissa ω, both PN and ω
being functions of H and q. Figure 5 shows the numerically constructed discrete
binned bivariate distribution of pairs (ω, PN ) for 12 6 ω 6 17. For values ω 6 12,
only one cluster with small values ω < 4.75 can be observed: such small values
of ω are associated with only one or at most two oscillations and correspond most
probably to the most probable oscillatory structure of multiplicative noise of power
law function [22]. Another possible origin of this cluster at ω < 4.75 is a residual
global trend which has not been completely accounted for by the (H, q)-derivative
[23,26].

Most of the Lomb periodograms associated with the points drawn in Fig. 5 have a
shape similar to that shown in Fig. 4. Speciﬁcally, the average angular log-frequencies
determined from this (H, q) analysis are 14.7 ± 0.3 for stock “J203”, 14.7 ± 0.1 for
stock “J580”, 15.0 ± 1.3 for stock “INL”, 13.7 ± 1.5 for stock “INP”, and 15.4 ± 0.1
for stock “NTC”. In summary, this (H, q)-analysis provides even stronger evidence
for the existence of log-periodicity than the parametric detrending approach of the
previous section 3.2.

with increment 0.02). Each marker in the ﬁgure corresponds to the highest Lomb peak and
its associated angular log-frequency in the Lomb periodogram of the (H, q)-derivative of
ln[p(t)] for a given pair (H, q).

3.4 Second-order Weierstrass-type LPPL model

As already pointed out above, the log-periodic angular frequencies are found to be
close to twice (J203, INL, INP, NTC) or four times (J580) the value ω1 ≈ 6.4 ± 1.5
of the fundamental log-periodic angular frequency found in many previous studies
[17,12]. This suggests that the ﬁrst-order LPPL formula (1) used until now should
be extended to include several harmonics. Indeed, the general mathematical for-
mulation of discrete scale invariance [34,16] shows that a log-periodic function is
expected in general to be represented by a systematic series of log-periodic terms
of the form [18]

I(t) = A + Bτ m + ℜ

(9)

Xn=1

where τ = tc − t as before. The main advantage of the high-order Weierstrass-
type LPPL models is that they allow to identify the fundamental log-frequency and
its harmonics. This family of models have been applied to the case study of many
bubbles and antibubbles [20], such as the UK real estate bubble in the last decade
[31], the 1975-2001 bubble in the American foreign assets capital inﬂow [30], the
Chinese stock market antibubble since 2001 [32], and the USA treasury bond yield
antibubble since 2000 [33].

We adopt the second-order Weierstrass-type LPPL model (9) with N = 2 to ﬁt
the logarithm of the ﬁve South African stock prices. The time evolution of the ﬁve
stocks and the corresponding ﬁts are drawn in Fig. 6.

2006. The rough curves are the historical raw data and the smooth curves are the associated
LPPL ﬁts. The values of the ﬁt parameters are listed in Table 2. The curves have been
shifted vertically for clarity.

The parameters of the ﬁve ﬁts using the second-order Weierstrass-type LPPL model
are presented in Table 2. We observe that, except from stock J203, the angular log-
frequencies lie in the range 6.5 ≤ ω ≤ 8.1, which is consistent with previous
results on the fundamental log-frequency ω1 = 6.4 ± 1.5 [12,17]. Speciﬁcally, this
conﬁrms the coexistence of this fundamental log-frequency together with its har-
monics, justifying the interpretation of the large values reported above with the
ﬁrst-order formula (1) as corresponding to the harmonics of ω1. The fact that the
angular log-frequency ω = 15.4 for stock “J203” is close to the second-order har-
monic of ω1 is probably associated with a very strong amplitude of the second
harmonics, which may hide the existence of ω1. It is also interesting to notice that
the absolute values of the linear parameters C1 and C2 are comparable. In three
cases |C2| > |C1|, indicating that the amplitudes of the second-order harmonic os-
cillations are considerable, again consistent with our previous interpretation of the
results obtained above.

Except for NTC, the exponents m are larger in the second-order LPPL ﬁt than in
the ﬁrst-order case. The critical times tc predicted to be the end of the bubbles
are quite robust: they are essentially unchanged for J203 and J580 while they are
pushed towards the future by roughly three months for the three other stocks, when
going from the ﬁrst-order to the second-order formula.

3.5 Comparison of the different methods

Let us now compare the estimated angular log-frequencies of the ﬁve stock bubbles
obtained with the different methods presented above: (i) the ﬁt with the ﬁrst order
LPPL function, (ii) the parametric detrending approach, (iii) the (H, q)-analysis,
and (iv) the ﬁt with the second-order Weierstrass-type function. The obtained angu-

and the large values are its higher-order harmonics.

For J203, the four methods give essentially the same value ω ≈ 15, which can be
interpreted as a very strong second harmonic 2ω1 of the fundamental log-periodic
angular log-frequency ω1 ≈ 6.4 ± 1.5 found in many previous studies [17,12].

For J580, the second-order LPPL ﬁt correctly identiﬁes the presence of ω1, and of
course its second-order harmonics. The (H, q) analysis identiﬁes the second har-
monics 2ω1 while the two other methods seem to be most sensitive to the fourth-
order harmonics.

For the three other stocks, the second-order LPPL ﬁt correctly identiﬁes the pres-
ence of ω1, while the three other methods extract its second harmonics 2ω1 as being
the dominant contribution, in agreement with the amplitude C2 > C1 determined
in their second-order LPPL ﬁt.

We conclude that genuine log-periodicity exists beyond any reasonable doubt in the
price trajectories of these ﬁve stocks, and that the extracted values of the angular
log-frequencies are compatible with previous results on other bubbles [17,12]. The

14

main novelty lies in the importance of the second-order and fourth-order harmonics,
which is larger than usual.

4 Sensitivity analysis of the critical times tc

The determination of the critical time tc is particularly important since it gives
the estimated termination time of the bubbles, which can occur approximately two
times out of three in the form of a signiﬁcant correction or a crash. It is noteworthy
to stress that a bubble does not end necessarily with a crash as there is a ﬁnite
probability for a bubble to end with a transition to another regime such as slow
deﬂation or correction [3,4]. The critical time tc is thus the end of the LPPL bubble
and the time at which the crash is most probable, if it ever occurs.

Given its high signiﬁcance, we have performed a sensitivity analysis of tc for the
ﬁve stocks with respect to different starting time tﬁrst and ending time tlast of the
price time series used in the ﬁtting procedure, following previous works [31,35,36].

4.1 The impact of tﬁrst

We ﬁrst study the impact of tﬁrst on tc and ω to check the stability of the estimated
critical time and the signiﬁcance of the log-periodic pattern. For each stock, we
use the ﬁrst-order LPPL formula (1) (respectively the second-order LPPL formula
(9)) to ﬁt the price time series from tﬁrst to 2006/05/26, where tﬁrst ranges from
2003/01/02 to 2004/12/01 with a spacing of 20 trading days. The results are pre-
sented in Fig. 7 (respectively Fig. 8). The overall conclusion is that both tc and
ω are very robust with respect to the choice of the starting time tﬁrst of the ﬁtting
interval.

4.2 The impact of tlast

We then study the impact of tlast on tc and ω to check the stability of the estimated
critical time and the signiﬁcance of the log-periodic pattern. For each stock, we
use the ﬁrst-order LPPL formula (1) (respectively the second-order LPPL formula
(9)) to ﬁt the price time series from 2003/01/02 to tlast, where tlast ranges from
2003/01/02 to 2004/12/01 with a spacing of 20 trading days. The results are pre-
sented in Fig. 9 (respectively Fig. 10). Overall, the conclusion is similar than for
the dependence on tﬁrst, conﬁrming the robustness of the ﬁts and the reliability of
our conclusions. The stock NTC is the only one exhibiting a change of regime in
the ﬁrst quarter of 2006, at which the ﬁtted tc jumps from Jan. 2006 to May 2006.

5 Concluding remarks

In summary, we have identiﬁed ﬁve stocks (1 (J203), 4 (J580), 19 (INL), 20 (INP),
and 30 (NTC)) out of a representative sample of forty ﬁve South African stocks,
that we qualiﬁed as being in a bubble regime deﬁned as a super-exponential growth
regime from Jan. 2003 to May 2006 with signiﬁcant log-periodic oscillations. We
studied the log-periodic characteristics of these stocks using four different tech-
niques, the parametric ﬁts with the ﬁrst-order LPPL formula, with the second-order
Weierstrass-type model, the parametric detrending method, and the (H, q)-analysis.
The four techniques give consistent estimations for the value of the fundamental an-
gular log-frequency ω1 in agreement with previous works on many other bubbles in
developed and emergent markets, conﬁrming with very high statistical conﬁdence
the existence of genuine log-periodicity.

Sensitivity tests of the estimated critical times and of the angular log-frequency by
varying the ﬁrst date and the last date of the stock price time series over which the
ﬁts are performed conﬁrm the robustness of the estimated parameters.

This study was performed at the end of May 2006 and we waited another six months
before completing this paper to see what were the subsequent evolutions of the
ﬁve stocks. It turns out that the many of the stocks on the South Africa market
experienced an abrupt drop in mid-June 2006, as can be seen from the ﬁgures above,
in which we have shown the subsequent price evolution beyond after May 2006. See
also the 45 price trajectories for the 45 assets and the ﬁt of the logarithm of their
price with the linear model and with the nonlinear model, available in Fig. 11-20 of
the extended version, only available online at http://arXiv.org/abs/physics/0701171.
This date (mid-June 2006) is compatible with the predicted tc for INL, INP and
NTC and to a lesser extend for J203. However, other stocks including J580 give
a much large tc, some time during 2007, suggesting that the potential for growth
in several of these stocks is not exhausted. It is possible that the mini-crash that

17

occurred in mid-June 2006 was only a partial correction, similarly to the Oct. 1997
8% drop witnessed on the S&P500 US market which, after being followed by a
plateau of three months, resumed in a strong acceleration, to ﬁnally end with the
real crash in August-September 1998 (see discussion of this sequence in [2]).

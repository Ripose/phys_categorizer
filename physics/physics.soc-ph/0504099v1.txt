1 Introduction

The G7 countries (France, USA, United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, Italy,
Canada) are the most developed countries in the world, but such statement
leaves unanswered the question on which of those is the most important one
and of course what kind of dependencies exists between them. Of course this
(Frankel 2000),
subject has been considered along various lines of analysis
which usually require a detailed knowledge of the analysed objects and there-
fore are diﬃcult to pursue. Our own question is to investigate the dependence
and leadership problem on a very limited number of data. Within this paper
correlations between G7 countries, are investigated on the basis of their Gross
Domestic Product (GDP). GDP is one of the most important parameters
describing state of an economy and is extensively studied (Lee et al. 1998,
Ormerod 2004).

The annual GDP records3, considered as a discrete time series are used over
the last 53 years (since 1950 till 2003) in order to evaluate GDP increments and
distances between those countries. Diﬀerent distance functions are used and
the results compared. Distance matrices are calculated in the case of discrete
Hilbert spaces Lq (q = 1, 2), Eq. (1), a statistical correlation distance, Eq.
(2), and a diﬀerence between increment distributions, Eq. (4). The distance
functions were chosen here below taking into account considerations on basic
properties of the data. The distance matrices are then analysed using graph
methods in the form of a unidirectional or bidirectional chain (UMLP and
(Ausloos and Miskiewicz 2005) as well as through the
BMLP respectively)
locally minimal spanning distance tree (LMST).

2 Distance and graph analysis

In the case of discrete time series the metrics can be deﬁned in the Hilbert
space Lq (q = 1, 2) in a standard way (Maurin 1991)

dq(A, B) = (

|ai − bi|q)

where A, B are time series: A = (a1, a2, . . . , an), B = (b1, b2, . . . , bn). The
statistical correlation distance is used in the form:

d(A, B)(t,T ) =

(1 − corr(t,T )(A, B)),

r

where t and T are the ﬁnal point and the size of the time window over which
an average is taken respectively; the correlation function is deﬁned as:

< AB >(t,T ) − < A >(t,T )< B >(t,T )

corr(t,T )(A, B) =

q

(< A2 >(t,T ) − < A >2

(t,T ))

The brackets < ... > denote a mean value over the time window T at time t.
Additionally the distribution p(r) function of GDP yearly increments (r)
is evaluated and the correlations between countries are investigated using Lq
(q = 1) metrics (Maurin 1991)

q .

Since the statistical parameters describing GDP increments are very close to
the normal distribution (Ausloos and Miskiewicz 2005) it is assumed that
this distribution well describes the GDP increments distribution.

There are diﬀerent advantages to each of those distance functions. The
discrete Hilbert space Lq distance Eq. (1) can be applied to any data and
does not require any special properties of the data so this method seems to
be very useful for comparing various sets of data. The second method Eq. (2),
a statistical distance, is specially sensitive to linear correlations. The third
method Eq. (4) is the most sophisticated one since it requires a knowledge of
the data distribution function, but then points out to similarities between data
statistical properties. The main disadvantage of the last method is that it is
sensitive to the size of the data set, since it is based on the whole distribution
function.

The distance matrices are built in a varying size time window moving along
the time axis. The distance matrices are analysed by network methods - in
the form of LMST and correlation chains (CC). The topological properties of
such trees and graphs, generated as a visualisation of the correlation between
GDP in G7 countries allow us to gain some practical information about the

weakest points of the networks and some possible roots for crashes, recessions
or booms as will be investigated in details in a following paper.

Our present analysis focuses on the globalization process of G7 country
economies, which is understood as an increasing resemblance between develop-
ment patterns. The question is investigated by means of the total graph weight
which is deﬁned as a sum of distances between the countries for a given graph
type (for LMST) and the mean distance for CC. LMST is a modiﬁcation of
the Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm (Cormen et al. 2001). It is built un-
der the constraints that the initial pair of nodes on the tree are the countries
with the strongest correlation between their GDP. CC are investigated in two
forms: unidirectional and bidirectional minimum length chains (called UMLP
and BMLP respectively) (Ausloos and Miskiewicz 2005). UMLP and BMLP
algorithms are simpliﬁcations for LMST, where the closest neighbouring coun-
tries are attached at the end of a chain. In the case of the unidirectional chain
the initial node is an arbitrary chosen country. Therefore in the case of UMLP
the chain is expanded in one direction only, whereas in the bidirectional case
countries might be attached at one of both ends depending on the distance
value.

Moreover a percolation threshold is deﬁned as the distance value at which
all countries are connected to the network. The percolation threshold has been
investigated for the diﬀerent distance measures. This technique allows us to
observe structures in GDP relationships between countries.

3 Results

The analysis is discussed here for a 15 years time window, which allows to
observe the globalization process and statistically compare results obtained
by diﬀerent methods. The graph and percolation analysis were performed in
the case of L1, L2, L1 and statistical distances. Figs 1,2 show the results of
graph analysis and Fig 3 the time evolution of the percolation threshold for
diﬀerent distance measures. Despite diﬀerences in values between results ob-
tained by LMST and CC methods (the graph weight takes its maximal value
up to 12 in the case of L1 in LMST, whereas in CC the maximal value of
the mean distance is not larger than 1.2) the time evolutions of the measured
parameters show that the distances between countries are monotonically de-
creasing in time whatever the method of analysis. However for the LMST
and percolation threshold in L1 metrics the evolution is not monotonous. Yet,
since the distances between countries are usually decreasing with time this
can be interpreted as a proof of a globalization process. A similar conclusion
may be obtained by analysing the percolation threshold of G7 countries (Fig
3). However the results depend on the applied distance measures, which are

tegna respectively.

sensitive to diﬀerent properties of the analysed time series. In the case of L1
and L2 distances the results do not signiﬁcantly depend on the visualisation
method. But in the L1 and statistical distances the results are not unique
specially in the case of the percolation threshold Fig (3).

4 Conclusions

The correlation between G7 countries has been analysed using diﬀerent dis-
tance functions and various graph methods. Despite the fact that most of the
methods allow to observe a globalization like process it is obvious that their
sensitivity to observe correlations are diﬀerent. It seems that the percolation
threshold methods is the most sensitive one, since even for L1 and L2 distance
functions it reveals diﬀerent stages of globalization. One can observe that the
correlations achieve their highest value in 1990, at well known signiﬁcant po-
litical changes in Europe. Later on, the correlations remain on a relatively
stable level. Analysing the applied distance functions it has been observed
that the noise level is the highest in the case of the L1 distance since this
method is the most sensitive to the length of the data (required for calcu-
lating the distribution parameters). However the L1 method seems to be the
most appropriate, because it compares the distribution functions taking into
considerations all properties of the process.

We present an analysis of the statistical properties and growth of the free on-line encyclopedia
Wikipedia. By describing topics by vertices and hyperlinks between them as edges, we can represent
this encyclopedia as a directed graph. The topological properties of this graph are in close analogy
with that of the World Wide Web, despite the very diﬀerent growth mechanism. In particular we
measure a scale–invariant distribution of the in– and out– degree and we are able to reproduce these
features by means of a simple statistical model. As a major consequence, Wikipedia growth can
be described by local rules such as the preferential attachment mechanism, though users can act
globally on the network.

Statistical properties of social networks has become a
major research topic in statistical physics of scale–free
networks [1, 2, 3]. Collaboration systems are a typical
example of social network, where vertices represent in-
dividuals. In the actors’ collaborations case [4], for in-
stance, the edges are drawn between actors playing to-
gether in the same movie. In the case of ﬁrm boards of
directors [5, 6], the managers are connected if they sit in
the same board. In the scientiﬁc co–authorship networks,
[7] an edge is drawn between scientists who co–authored
at least one paper. Other kinds of networks, such as in-
formation ones, are the result of human interaction: the
World Wide Web (WWW) is a well–known example of
such, although its peculiarities often put it outside the
social networks category [8].

In this paper, we analyze the graph of Wikipedia [9],
a virtual encyclopedia on line. This system grows con-
stantly as new entries are continuously added by users
through the Internet. Thanks to the Wiki software [10],
any user can introduce new entries and modify the entries
already present. It is natural to represent this system as a
directed graph, where the vertices correspond to entries
and edges to hyperlinks, autonomously drawn between
various entries by contributors.

The main observation is that the Wikipedia graph
exhibits a topological bow–tie–like structure, as does
the WWW. Moreover, the frequency distribution for
the number of incoming (in–degree) and outgoing (out–
degree) edges decays as a power–law, while the in–degrees
of connected vertices are not correlated. As these ﬁndings
suggest, edges are not drawn toward and from existing
topics uniformly; rather, a large number of incoming and
outgoing edges increases the probability of acquiring new
incoming and outgoing edges respectively. In the litera-
ture concerning scale–free networks, this phenomenon is
called “preferential attachment” [4], and it is explained
in detail below.

Wikipedia is an intriguing research object from a so-
ciologist’s point of view: pages are published by a num-

ber of independent and heterogeneous individuals in var-
ious languages, covering topics they consider relevant
and about which they believe to be competent. Our
dataset encompasses the whole history of the Wikipedia
database, reporting any addition or modiﬁcation to the
encyclopedia. Therefore, the rather broad information
contained in the Wikipedia dataset can be used to val-
idate existing models for the development of scale–free
networks. In particular, we found here one of the ﬁrst
large–scale conﬁrmations of the preferential attachment,
or “rich–get–richer”, rule. This result is rather surpris-
ing, since preferential attachment is usually associated
to network growth mechanisms triggered by local events:
in the WWW, for instance, webmasters have control on
their own web pages and outgoing hyperlinks, and can-
not modify the rest of the network by adding edges else-
where. Instead, by the “Wiki” technology a single user
can edit an unlimited number of edges and topics within
the Wikipedia network.

The dataset presented here gathers Wikipedia pages
in about 100 diﬀerent languages; the largest subset at
the time of our analysis was made by the almost 500, 000
pages of the English version, growing at an exponential
pace[11]. A detailed analysis of the algorithms [13] used
to crawl such data is presented elsewhere [14]. Here, we
start our analysis by considering a typical taxonomy of
regions introduced for the WWW [15]. The ﬁrst region
includes pages that are mutually reachable by traveling
on the graph, named the strongly connected component
(SCC); pages from which one reaches the SCC form the
second region, the IN component, while the OUT com-
ponent encompasses the pages reached from the SCC. A
fourth region, named TENDRILS, gathers pages reach-
able from the IN component and pointing neither to the
SCC nor the OUT region. TENDRILS also includes
those pages that point to the OUT region but do not be-
long to any of the other deﬁned regions. Finally TUBES
connect directly IN and OUT regions, and few pages are
totally disconnected (DISC). The result is the so–called

As a general remark, Wikipedia shows a rather large
interconnection; this means that most of the vertices are
in the SCC. From almost any page it is possible to reach
any other. This feature describes one of the few diﬀer-
ences between the on-line encyclopedia and the WWW:
the content of an article can be fully understood by vis-
iting a connected path along the network.

, with 2 ≤ γin,out ≤ 2.1.

The key quantities characterizing the structure of an
oriented network are the in–degree (kin) and out–degree
(kout) distributions. As shown in ﬁg. 2, both distribu-
tions display an algebraic decay, of the kind P (kin,out) ∝
k

−γin,out

We proceeded further by studying the dynamics of the
network growth. The analysis has been made in order to
validate the current paradigm explaining the formation of
scale–free networks, introduced by the Barab´asi–Albert
(BA) model [1]. The latter is based on the interplay of
two ingredients: growth and preferential attachment. In
the BA model, new vertices are added to the graph at
discrete time steps and a ﬁxed number m of edges con-
nects each new vertex to the old ones. The preferential
attachment rule corresponds to assigning a probability
Π(ki) ∼ ki that a new vertex is connected to an existing
vertex i whose degree is ki. This elementary process gen-
erates a non–oriented network where the degree follows

a power–law distribution.

To observe such a mechanism in a real network, one
builds the histogram of the degree of the vertices acquir-
ing new connections at each time t, weighted by a factor
N (t)/n(k, t), where N (t) is the number of vertices at time
t and n(k, t) is the number of vertices with in–degree k
at time t. [17].

Since the Wikipedia network is oriented, the preferen-
tial attachment must be veriﬁed in both directions. In
particular, we have observed how the probability of ac-
quiring a new incoming (outgoing) edge depends on the
present in–(out–)degree of a vertex. The result for the
main Wikipedia network (the English one) is reported
in Fig.3. For a linear preferential attachment, as sup-
posed by the BA model, both plots should be linear over
the entire range of degrees, here we recover this behav-
ior only partly. This is not surprising, since several mea-
surements reported in literature display strong deviations
from a linear behavior [18] for large values of the degree,
even in networks with an inherent preferential attach-
ment [17]. Nevertheless it is worth to mention that the
preferential attachment in Wikipedia has a somewhat dif-
ferent nature. Here, most of the times, the edges are
added between existing vertices diﬀerently from the BA
model. For instance, in the English version of Wikipedia
a largely dominant fraction 0.883 of new edges is created
between two existing pages, while a smaller fraction of
edges points or leaves a newly added vertex (0.026 and
0.091 respectively).

To draw a more complete picture of the Wikipedia net-
work, we have also measured the correlations between the
in– and out–degrees of connected pages. The relevance of
this quantity is emphasized by several examples of com-
plex networks shown to be fully characterized by their

degree distribution and degree–degree correlations [19].
A suitable measure for such correlations is the average
degree K (nn)(k) of vertices connected to vertices with
degree k (for simplicity, here we refer to a non–oriented
network to explain the notation). These quantities are
particularly interesting when studying social networks.
As other social networks, collaborative networks studied
so far are characterized by assortative mixing, i.e. edges
preferably connect vertices with similar degrees [8]. This
picture would reﬂect in a K (nn)(k) growing with respect
If K (nn)(k) (decays) grows with k, vertices with
to k.
similar degrees are (un)likely to be connected. This ap-
pears to be a clear cutting method to establish whether a
complex network belongs to the realm of social networks,
if other considerations turn ambiguous [20].

In the case of an oriented network, such as Wikipedia,
one has many options while performing such assessment:
since we could measure the correlations between the in–
or the out–degrees of neighbor vertices, along incoming
or outgoing edges. We chose to study the average in–
degree K (nn)
in (kin) of upstream neighbors, i.e. pointing
to vertices with in–degree kin. By focusing on the in–
degree and on the incoming edges, we expect to extract
information about the collective behavior of Wikipedia
contributors and ﬁlter out their individual peculiarities:
the latter have a strong impact on the out–degree of a
vertex and on the choice of its outgoing edges, since con-
tributors often focus on a single Wikipedia topic [11].

Our analysis shows a substantial lack of correlation
between the in–degrees of a vertex and the average in–
degree of its upstream neighboring vertices. So, as re-
ported in ﬁg. 4, incoming edges carry no information
about the in–degrees of the connected vertices, since
K (nn)(kin) display no clear increasing or decreasing be-
havior when plotted against kin.

The above quantities, including the power law distri-

incoming edges, as a function of the in–degree for the English
(circles) and Portuguese (triangles) Wikipedia, compared to
the simulations of the models for N = 20000, M = 10, R1 =
0.026 and R2 = 0.091 (dashed line) and a realization of the
model where the ﬁrst 0.5% of the vertices has been removed
to reduce the initial condition impact (thick solid line).

bution of the degrees and the absence of degree–degree
correlations, can be modeled by simple applications of
the preferential attachment principle. Let us consider
the following evolution rule, similarly to other models of
rewiring already considered[12], for a growing directed
network such as Wikipedia: at each time step, a vertex
is added to the network, and is connected to the existing
vertices by M oriented edges; the direction of each edge is
drawn at random: with probability R1 the edge leaves the
new vertex pointing to an existing one chosen with prob-
ability proportional to its in–degree; with probability R2,
the edge points to the new vertex, and the source vertex
is chosen with probability proportional to its out–degree.
Finally, with probability R3 = 1 − R1 − R2 the edge
is added between existing vertices: the source vertex is
chosen with probability proportional to the out–degree,
while the destination vertex is chosen with probability
proportional to the in–degree.

By solving the rate equations for kin and kout by stan-
dard arguments [1], we can show that this mechanism
generates power law distributions of both the in–degree
and the out–degree: kin and kout:

P (kin) ≃ k

P (kout) ≃ k

which can be easily veriﬁed by numerical simulation.

By adopting the values empirically found in the En-
glish Wikipedia R1 = 0.026, R2 = 0.091 and R3 = 0.883,
one recovers the same power law degree distributions of
the real network, as shows ﬁgure 2.

The degree–degree correlations K (nn)

in (kin) can be com-
puted analytically by the same lines of reasoning de-

scribed in references [20, 21], and for 1 ≪ kin ≪ N we

for R3 6= 0, the proportionality coeﬃcient depending only
on the initial condition of the network, and

K (nn)

in (kin) ≃ M R1R2 ln N

for R3 = 0, where N is the network size. Both equations
are independent from kin, as conﬁrmed by the simulation
reported in ﬁg. 4 for the same values of R1, R2 and R3.
Therefore, the theoretical degree–degree correlation re-
produces qualitatively the observed behavior; to obtain
a more accurate quantitative agreement with data, it is
suﬃcient to tune the initial conditions appropriately. As
shown in ﬁg. 4, this can be done by neglecting a small
fraction of initial vertices in the network model.

In conclusion, the bow–tie structure already observed
in the World Wide Web, and the algebraic decay of the
in–degree and out–degree distribution are observed in the
Wikipedia datasets surveyed here. At a deeper level, the
structure of the degree–degree correlation also resembles
that of a network developed by a simple preferential at-
tachment rule. This has been veriﬁed by comparing the
Wikipedia dataset to models displaying no correlation
between the neighbors’ degrees.

Thus, the empirical and theoretical evidences show
that traditional models introduced to explain non triv-

ial features of complex networks by simple algorithms
remain qualitatively valid for Wikipedia, whose techno-
logical framework would allow a wider variety of evolu-
tionary patterns. This reﬂects on the role played by the
preferential attachment in generating complex networks:
such mechanism is traditionally believed to hold when
the dissemination of information throughout a social net-
work is not eﬃcient and a “bounded rationality” hypoth-
esis [22, 23] is assumed. In the WWW, for example, the
preferential attachment is the result of the diﬃculty for a
webmaster to identify optimal sources of information to
refer to, favoring the herding behavior which generates
the “rich–get–richer” rule. One would expect the coordi-
nation of the collaborative eﬀort to be more eﬀective in
the Wikipedia environment since any authoritative agent
can use his expertise to tune the linkage from and toward
any page in order to optimize information mining. Nev-
ertheless, empirical evidences show that the statistical
properties of Wikipedia do not diﬀer substantially from
those of the WWW. This suggests two possible scenarios:
preferential attachment may be the consequence of the
intrinsic organization of the underlying knowledge; alter-
natively, the preferential attachment mechanism emerges
because the Wiki technical capabilities are not fully ex-
if this is the case,
ploited by Wikipedia contributors:
their focus on each speciﬁc subject puts much more ef-
fort in building a single Wiki entry, with little attention
toward the global eﬃciency of the organization of infor-
mation across the whole encyclopedia. Authors acknowl-

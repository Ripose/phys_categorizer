Abstract: On directed Barab´asi-Albert networks with two and seven neigh-
bours selected by each added site, the Ising model was seen not to show a spon-
taneous magnetisation. Instead, the decay time for ﬂipping of the magnetisation
followed an Arrhenius law for Metropolis and Glauber algorithms, but for Wolﬀ
cluster ﬂipping the magnetisation decayed exponentially with time. On these net-
works the Majority-vote model with noise is now studied through Monte Carlo
simulations. However, in this model, the order-disorder phase transition of the or-
der parameter is well deﬁned in this system. We calculate the value of the critical
noise parameter qc for several values of connectivity z of the directed Barab´asi-
Albert network. The critical exponentes β/ν, γ/ν and 1/ν were calculated for
several values of z.

Keywords:Monte Carlo simulation,vote , networks, nonequilibrium.

Introduction
It has been argued that nonequilibrium stochastic spin systems on reg-
ular square lattice with up-down symmetry fall in the universality class of
the equilibrium Ising model [1]. This conjecture was found in several models
that do not obey detailed balance [2, 3, 4]. Campos et al. [5] investigated the
majority-vote model on small-world network by rewiring the two dimensional
square lattice. These small-world networks, aside from presenting quenched
disorder, also posses long-range interactions. They found that the critical
exponents γ/ν and β/ν are diﬀerent from the Ising model and depend on the
rewiring probability. However, it was not evident that the exponent change
was due to the disordered nature of the network or due to the presence of
long-range interactions. Lima et al. [6] studied the majority-vote model on
Voronoi-Delaunay random lattices with periodic boundary conditions. These
lattices posses natural quenched disorder in their conecctions. They showed
that presence of quenched connectivity disorder is enough to alter the ex-
ponents β/ν and γ/ν from the pure model and therefore that is a relevant
term to such non-equilibrium phase-transition. Sumour and Shabat [7, 8]

1

investigated Ising models on directed Barab´asi-Albert networks [9] with the
usual Glauber dynamics. No spontaneous magnetisation was found, in con-
trast to the case of undirected Barab´asi-Albert networks [10, 11, 12] where
a spontaneous magnetisation was found lower a critical temperature which
increases logarithmically with system size. More recently, Lima and Stauﬀer
[13] simulated directed square, cubic and hypercubic lattices in two to ﬁve
dimensions with heat bath dynamics in order to separate the network ef-
fects from the eﬀects of directedness. They also compared diﬀerent spin ﬂip
algorithms, including cluster ﬂips [14], for Ising-Barab´asi-Albert networks.
They found a freezing-in of the magnetisation similar to [7, 8], following an
Arrhenius law at least in low dimensions. This lack of a spontaneous mag-
netisation (in the usual sense) is consistent with the fact that if on a directed
lattice a spin Sj inﬂuences spin Si, then spin Si in turn does not inﬂuence
Sj, and there may be no well-deﬁned total energy. Thus, they show that for
the same scale-free networks, diﬀerent algorithms give diﬀerent results. Now
we study the Majority-vote model on directed Barab´asi-Albert network and
diﬀerent from the Ising model, the order-disorder phase transition of order
parameter well it is deﬁned in this system. We calculate the β/ν, γ/ν, and
1/ν exponents and these are diﬀerent from the Ising model and depend on
the values of connectivity z of the directed Barab´asi-Albert network.

Model and Simulaton
We consider the majority-vote model, on directed Barab´asi-Albert Net-
works, deﬁned [15, 16, 6, 17] by a set of ”voters” or spins variables σ taking
the values +1 or −1, situated on every site of a directed Barab´asi-Albert
Networks with N sites, and evolving in time by single spin-ﬂip like dynamics
with a probability wi given by

wi(σ) =

1 − (1 − 2q)σiS

where S(x) is the sign ±1 of x if x 6= 0, S(x) = 0 if x = 0, and the sum
runs over all nearest neighbors of σi. In this network, each new site added to
the network selects z already existing sites as neighbours inﬂuencing it; the
newly added spin does not inﬂuence these neighbours. The control parameter

2

q plays the role of the temperature in equilibrium systems and measures the
probability of aligning antiparalle to the majority of neighbors.

To study the critical behavior of the model we deﬁne the variable m =
N
i=1 σi/N. In particular , we were interested in the magnetisation, suscep-

tibility and the reduced fourth-order cumulant:
P

where < ... > stands for a thermodynamics average and [...]av square brackets
for a averages over the 20 realizations.

These quantities are functions of the noise parameter q and obey the

ﬁnite-size scaling relations

M(q) = [< |m| >]av,

χ(q) = N[< m2 > − < |m| >2]av,

< m4 >

U(q) =

,

M = N −β/νfm(x)[1 + ...],
χ = N γ/νfχ(x)[1 + ...],
dU
dq

= N 1/νfU (x)[1 + ...],

where ν, β, and γ are the usual critical exponents, fi(x) are the ﬁnite size
scaling functions with

x = (q − qc)N 1/ν

being the scaling variable, and the brackets [1 + ...] indicate corretions-to-
scaling terms. Therefore, from the size dependence of M and χ we obtained
the exponents β/ν and γ/ν, respectively. The maximum value of susceptibil-
ity also scales as N γ/ν. Moreover, the value of q for which χ has a maximum,
qχmax
c

= qc(N), is expected to scale with the system size as

qc(N) = qc + bN −1/ν ,

were the constant b is close to unity. Therefore, the relations (7) and (9) are
used to determine the exponente 1/ν. We have checked also if the calculated
exponents satisfy the hyperscaling hypothesis

2β/ν + γ/ν = Def f

in order to get the eﬀective dimensionality, Def f , for various values of z.

We have performed Monte Carlo simulation on directed Barab´asi-Albert
networks with various values of connectivity z. For a given z, we used systems
of size N = 1000, 2000, 4000, 8000, and 16000. We waited 10000 Monte Carlo
steps (MCS) to make the system reach the steady state, and the time averages
were estimated from the next 10000 MCS. In our simulations, one MCS is
accomplished after all the N spins are updated. For all sets of parameters,
we have generated 20 distinct networks, and have simulated 20 independent
runs for each distinct network.

Results and Discussion
In Fig. 1 we show the dependence of the magnetisation M and the sus-
ceptiblity χ on the noise parameter, obtained from simulations on directed
Barab´asi-Albert network with 16000 sites and several values of conectivity z.
In the part (a) each curve for M, for a given value of N and z, suggests that
there is a phase transition from an ordered state to a disordered state. The
phase transition occurs at a value of the critical noise parameter qc, which
is an increasing function the conectivity z of the directed Barab´asi-Albert
network. In the part (b) we show the corresponding behavior of the suscep-
tibility χ, the value of q where χ has a maximum is here identiﬁed as qc. In
Fig. 2 we plot the Binder’s fourth-order cumulant for diﬀerent values of N
and two diﬀerent values of z. The critical noise parameter qc, for a given
value of z, is estimated as the point where the curves for diﬀerent system
sizes N intercept each other. In Fig 3. the phase diagram is shown as the
dependence of the critical noise parameter qc on connectivity z obtained from
the data of Fig. 2.

The phase diagram of the majority-vote model on directed Barab´asi-
Albert network shows that for a given network (ﬁxed z ) the system becomes
ordered for q < qc, whereas it has zero magnetisation for q ≥ qc. We notice
that the increase of qc as a function of z is slower than the one than in [17].
In the Fig. 4 we plot the dependence of the magnetisation at q = qc with the
system size. The slopes of curves correspond to the exponent ratio β/ν of
according to Eq. (5). The results show that the exponent ratio β/ν decreases
when z increases, see Table I.

In Fig. 5 we display the scalings for susceptibility at χ(qc(N)) (circle)
for its maximum amplitude χmax
N , and χ(qc(N)) (square) obtained from the
Binder’s cumulant versus N for connectivity z = 8. The exponents ratios
γ/ν are obtained from the slopes of the straight lines. For almost all the

4

′

values of z, the exponents γ/ν of the two estimates disagree (Table I). An
increased z means a tendency to increase the exponent ratio γ/ν, see Table
I, so that they disagree with the results of Luiz et al [17] , where the values
of exponents ratio γ/ν are almost all equal and with a slight tendency to
decrease. Therefore we cannot use the Eq.(9), for ﬁxed z, obtain the critical
exponent 1/ν. In the Fig. 6 we show the critical behavior of β/ν and γ/ν as
a function of connectivity z.

To obtain the critical exponent 1/ν, we calculated numerically U

(q) =
dU(q)/dq at the critical point for each values of N at connectivity ﬁxed z.
The results are bad agreement with the scaling relation (7). Then, also we
cannot calculate the exponents 1/ν, through this relation. Therefore we do
not obtain to get the values of the exponents 1/ν for each connectivity z

The Table I resumes the values of qc, the exponents β/ν, γ/ν, and the
eﬀective dimensionality of systems. For all values of z the value Def f = 1,
which has been obtained from the Eq. (9), therefore when z increases, β/ν
decreases and γ/ν increases, thus providing the value of Def f = 1 (along
with errors). Therefore, the directed Barab´asi-Albert network has the same
eﬀective dimensionality as Erd¨os-R´enyi’s random graphs [17] . J. M. Oliveira
[15] showed which majority-vote model deﬁned on regular lattice has critical
exponents that fall into the same class of universality as the corresponding
equilibrium Ising model. Campos et al [5] investigated the critical behavior of
the majority-vote on small-world networks by rewiring the two-dimensional
square lattice, Luiz et al [17] studied this model on Erd¨os-R´enyi’s random
graphs, and Lima et al [6] also studied this model on Voronoi-Delaunay lat-
tice. The results obtained by these authors show that the critical exponents
of majority-vote model belong to diﬀerent universality classes.

Finally, we remark that our MC results obtained on directed Barab´asi-
Albert network and undirected (in preparation) majority-vote model show
that critical exponents are diﬀerent from the results of [15] for regular lattice
and of Luiz et al [17] for Erd¨os-R´enyi’s random graphs .

Conclusion
In conclusion, we have presented a very simple nonequilibrium model
on directed Barab´asi-Albert network [7, 8]. Diﬀerent from the Ising model,
in these networks, the Majority-vote model presents a second-order phase
transition which occurs in model with connectivity z > 1. The exponents
obtained are diﬀerentfrom the other models. Nevertheless, our Monte Carlo
simulations have demonstrated that the eﬀective dimensionality Def f equals

However, when z grows, the exponents at the critical point qc, β/ν obtained
by Binder’s cumulant decrease and the exponents γ/ν grow, satisfying the
hyperscaling relation with Def f = 1.

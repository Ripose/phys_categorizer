The scale-free (SF) structure that commonly appears in many complex networks is one of the
hot topics related to social, biological, and information sciences. The self-organized generation
mechanisms are expected to be useful for eﬃcient communication or robust connectivity in socio-
technological infrastructures. This paper is the ﬁrst review of geographical SF network models. We
discuss the essential generation mechanisms to induce the structure with power-law behavior and
the properties of planarity and link length. The distributed designs of geographical SF networks
without the crossing and long-range links that cause the interference and dissipation problems are
very important for many applications such as in the Internet, power-grid, mobile, and sensor systems.

I.

INTRODUCTION

As a breakthrough in network science [1], it has been
found [2] that many real systems of social, technolog-
ical, and biological origins have the surprisingly com-
mon topological structure called small-world (SW) [3]
and scale-free (SF) [4]. The structure is characterized
by the SW properties that the average path length over
all nodes (vertices) is short as similar to that in ran-
dom graphs, and that the clustering coeﬃcient, deﬁned
by the average ratio of the number of links (edges) con-
necting to its nearest neighbors of a node to the number
of possible links between all these nearest neighbors, is
large as similar to that in regular graphs. Large cluster-
ing coeﬃcient means the high frequency of “the friend
of a friend is also his/her friend.” As the SF property,
the degree distribution follows a power-law, P (k) ∼ k−γ,
2 < γ < 3; the fat-tail distribution consists of many
nodes with low degrees and a few hubs with very high
degrees. Moreover, a proposal of the universal mecha-
nisms [4] to generate SF networks inspired to elucidate
the topological properties. One of the advantage is that
SF networks are optimal in minimizing both the eﬀort for
communication and the cost for maintaining the connec-
tions [5]. Intuitively, SF network is positioned between
star or clique graph for minimizing the path length (the
number of hops or legs) and random tree for minimizing
the number of links within the connectivity. Another im-
portant property is that SF networks are robust against
random failures but vulnerable against the targeted at-
tacks on hubs. This vulnerability called “Achilles’ heel
of the Internet” [6] frightened us. However the vulner-
ability is a double-edged sword for information delivery
and spreading of viruses, we expect that these properties
will be useful for developing eﬃcient and fault-tolerant
networks with a defense mechanism based on the protec-
tion of hubs. Since the SF structure is at least selected
with self-organized manners in social and biological envi-
ronments, the evolutional mechanisms may give insight

to distributed network designs or social managements in
communication or business.

On the other hand, in contrast to abstract graphs,
many real networks are embedded in a metric space. It
is therefore natural to investigate the possibility of em-
bedding SF networks in space. The related applications
are very wide in the Internet(routers), power-grids, air-
lines, mobile communication [7], sensor networks [8], and
so on. However most of the works on SF networks were
irrelevant to a geographical space. In this paper, focus-
ing on the SF structure found in many real systems, we
consider generation rules of geographical networks whose
nodes are set on a Euclidean space and the undirected
links between them are weighted by the Euclidean dis-
tance.

The organization of this paper is as follows. In section
2, we introduce an example that shows the restriction
of long-range links in real networks. Indeed, the decay
of connection probability for the distance between nodes
follows exponential or power-law. In section 3, we review
recent studies of geographical SF network models, which
are categorized in three classes by the generation rules.
We refer to the analytical forms of degree distributions
that characterize the SF structure. In section 4, we con-
sider the relations among these models. In addition, we
compare the properties of planarity and distance of con-
nections. Finally, in section 5, the summary and further
issues are brieﬂy discussed.

II. SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION IN REAL-WORLD
NETWORKS

The restriction of long-range links has been observed in
real networks: Internet at both router and autonomous
system (AS) levels obtained by using NETGEO tool to
identify the geographical coordinates of 228,265 routers
[9]. These data suggest that the distribution of link
lengths (distance) is inversely proportional to the lengths,

invalidating the Waxman’s exponentially decay rule [10]
which is widely used in traﬃc simulations. Other ev-
idence has been reported for the real data of Inter-
net as AS level (7,049 nodes and 13,831 links) com-
piled by the University of Oregon’s Route Views project,
road networks of US interstate highway (935 nodes and
1,337 links) extracted from GIS databases, and ﬂight-
connections (187 nodes and 825 links) in a major airline
[11]. It has been shown that all three networks have a
clear bias towards shorter links to reduce the costs for
construction and maintenance, however there exist some
diﬀerences: the road network has only very short links
on the order of 10km to 100km in the sharply decaying
distribution, while the Internet and airline networks have
much longer ones in the bimodal distribution with dis-
tinct peaks around 2000km or less and 4000km. These
diﬀerences may come from physical constraints in the link
cost or the necessaries of long distant direct connections.

As a similar example, we investigate the distributions
of link lengths (distances of ﬂights) in Japanese airlines
[12]. The networks consists of 52 nodes (airports) and
961 links (ﬂights) in the Japan AirLines (JAL), 49 nodes
and 909 links in the All Nippon Airlines (ANA), and
84 nodes and 1,114 links including the international one.
Fig. 1 shows the cumulative number of ﬂights for the
decreasing order of length measured by mile. We remark
an exponential decay in the domestic ﬂights (red and blue
lines in the Fig. 1), while it rather follows a power-law by
adding the international ﬂights (green line in the Fig. 1).
Note that the distribution of the link lengths is obtained
by the diﬀerential of the cumulative one and that the
decay form of exponential or power-law is invariant.

Thus, link lengths are restricted in real systems, al-
though the distribution may have some various forms as
similar to the cases of degree distribution [13].

III. GEOGRAPHICAL SF NETWORK MODELS

We review geographical SF network models in the
state-of-the-art. By the generation rules of networks,
they are categorized in three classes as shown in Table I.
The generation rules are explained by variations in the
balance of minimizing the number of hops between nodes
(beneﬁts for transfers) and the link lengths.

In this section, we refer to the generation rules and the
power-law behavior only in the essential forms because
of the limited pages. The properties of planarity without
crossing links and the link lengths will be discussed in
the next section.

A. SF networks with disadvantaged long-range
links

The modulated Barab´asi-Albert (BA) model [14] and
the geographical threshold graph [18] belong to the ﬁrst
class: SF networks with disadvantaged long-range links
between nodes whose positions are random on a space
[42]. They are natural extensions of the previous non-
geographical SF network models by the competition of
preferential linking based on the degree or weight and
the restriction of link length (distance dependence).

1. Modulated BA model in the Euclidean space

Before explaining the ﬁrst class, we introduce the well-
known BA model [4] generated by the following rule:
growth with a new node at each time and preferential
attachment of links to nodes with large degrees (see Fig.
2(a)).

BA-Step 0: A network grows from an initial N0 nodes

with m < N0 links among them.

FIG. 1: Cumulative number of ﬂights in Japanese airlines.
The red, blue, and green lines correspond to domestic ﬂights
in JAL, ANA, and that including international ﬂights (Inset:
semi-log scale). The magenta and cyan lines guide the esti-
mated functions of exponential and power-law, respectively.

BA-Step 1: At every time step, a new node is intro-
duced and is randomly connected to m previous
nodes as follows.

BA-Step 2: Any of these m links of the new node in-
troduced at time t connects a previous node i with
an attachment probability ΠBA
(t) which is linearly

i

proportional to the degree ki(t) of the ith node at
time t, ΠBA

(t) ∼ ki(t).

i

The preferential attachment makes a heterogeneous net-
work with hubs. More precisely, the degree distribution
P (k) ∼ k−3 is analytically obtained by using a mean-
ﬁeld approximation [4] in the continuum approach [2],
in which the time dependence of the degree ki of a given
node i is calculated through the continuous real variables
of degree and time.

Based on a competition between the preferential at-
tachment and the distance dependence of links, the mod-
ulated BA model on a space with physical distance has
been considered [14]. Note that the position of new node
is random. The network is grown by introducing at unit
rate randomly selected nodes on the Euclidean space (e.g.
two-dimensional square area), and the probability of con-
nection is modulated according to Πi(t) ∼ ki(t)lα, where
l is the Euclidean distance between the tth (birth at time
t) and the older ith nodes, and α is a parameter. The
case of α = 0 is the original BA model [4]. In the limit of
α → −∞, only the smallest value of l corresponding to
the nearest node will contribute with probability 1. Sim-
ilarly, in the limit of α → ∞, only the furthest node will
contribute. Indeed, it has been estimated that the distri-
bution of link lengths follows a power-law l−δ (long-range
links are rare at δ > 0), whose exponent is calculated by
δ = α + d − 1 for all values of α [14].

In the modulated BA model on a one-dimensional lat-
tice (circumference), it has been numerically shown that
[19] for −1 < α < 0 the degree distribution is close to a
power-law, but for α < −1 it is represented by a stretched
exponential P (k) = a exp(−bkγ), where the parameters
a, b, and γ depend on α and m, although the SW prop-
erty [3] is preserved at all values of α. For the transition
from the stretched exponential to the SF behavior, the
critical value is generalized to αc = 1−d in the embedded
d-dimensional space [14]. More systematic classiﬁcation
in a parameter space of the exponents of degree, distance,
and fractal dimension has been also discussed [9].

Other related studies to the form of connection prob-
ability Πi ∼ kβ
i lα are the phase diagram of the cluster-
ing properties in the α-β plane [15], the comparison of
the topological properties for the special case of the con-
nection probability proportional to the distance (α = 1,
β = 0) and the inverse distance (α = −1, β = 0) [16], the
numerical investigation of the scaling for the quantities
(degree, degree-degree correlation, clustering coeﬃcient)
of the network generated by the connection probability
proportional to the degree with the exponential decay of
the distance [17], and so on.

2. Geographical threshold graphs

clidean space with disadvantaged long-range links. We
brieﬂy show the analysis of degree distribution.

Let us consider a set of nodes with the size N . We
assume that each node i is randomly distributed with
uniform density ρ in the space whose coordinates are de-
noted by x1, x2, . . . , xd, and that it is assigned with a
weight wi ≥ 0 by a density function f (w). According
to the threshold mechanism [18], a pair of node (i, j) is
connected iﬀ

(wi + wj )h(rij ) ≥ θ,

(1)

where h(rij ) is a decreasing function of the distance rij >
0 between the nodes, and θ is a constant threshold.

θ
2w∗

If f (w) is the Dirac delta function at w∗ > 0, then
the condition of connection (1) is equivalent to rij ≥
def= r∗ by using the inverse function h−1. This
h−1
case is the unit disk graph, as a model of mobile and
sensor networks, in which the two nodes within the radius
r∗ are connected according to the energy consumption.
However, the degree distribution P (k) is homogeneous.
We need more inhomogeneous weights.

(cid:1)

Thus, if the exponential weight distribution

f (w) = λe−λw,

(2)

and the power-law decay function h(rij ) = (rij )−β, β ≥
0, are considered, then the degree is derived as a function
of weight

From (3) and (4), we obtain the power-law degree distri-

Note that this result is derived only if the value of β is
suﬃciently small, otherwise the degree distribution has a
streched exponential decay or an exponential decay.

we similarly obtain

k(w) ∼ wd/β, P (k) ∼ k−(1+αβ/d).

The exponent γ def= 1 + αβ/d is a variable depends on the
parameters α and β.

Furthermore, we mention a gravity model with
h(rij ) = 1/ log rij .
In this case, the condition of con-
nection (1) is rewritten as wi + wj ≥ θ log rij , and into

by the variable transformations Wi
and (Rij )β def= (rij )θ/θ. Eq. (6) represents a physical,
sociological, or chemical interactions with power-law dis-
tance dependence. For the combination of (6) and the
weight distributions f (w) in (2) and (5), we can also
derive the more complicated forms of P (k). Thus, the
choice of f (w) matters for the SF properties in contrast
to an approximately constant exponent γ ≈ 2 in the non-
geographical threshold graphs [21] without h(rij ).

respectively.

B. SF networks embedded on lattices

The second class is based on the SF networks embed-
ded on regular Euclidean lattices (SFL) accounting for
graphical properties [22] [23]. We distinguish this class
from the ﬁrst one, because the position of node is not
randomly distributed but well-ordered on a lattice with
a scale that gives the minimum distance.

Let us consider a d-dimensional lattice of size R with
periodic boundary conditions. The model is deﬁned by
the following conﬁguration procedures (see Fig. 2(b)) on
an assumption of power-law degree distribution.

4

SFL-Step 0: To each node on the lattice, assign a ran-
dom degree k taken from the distribution P (k) =
Ck−λ, m ≤ k ≤ K, λ > 2, (the normalization
constant: C ≈ (λ − 1)mλ−1 for large K).

SFL-Step 1: Select a node i at random, and connect it
to its closest neighbors until its connectivity ki is
realized, or until all nodes up to a distance,

r(ki) = Ak1/d

,

i

(7)

have been explored: The connectivity quota kj of
the target node j is already ﬁlled in saturation.
Here A > 0 is a constant.

SFL-Step 2: The above process is repeated for all

nodes.

As in Ref. [22], we derive the cutoﬀ connectivity. Con-
sider the number of links n(r) entering a node from a
surrounding neighborhood of radius r, when the lattice
is inﬁnite, R → ∞. The probability of connections be-
tween the origin and nodes at distance r′ is

cutoﬀ connectivity is then

n(r) = VdAdhki,

where hki =

If A is large enough such that kc > K, the network can
be embedded without cutoﬀ. Otherwise, by substituting
(8) into (7), the cutoﬀ connectivity kc implies a cutoﬀ
length

ξ = r(kc) = (Vdhki)1/dA2.

(9)

The embedded network displays the original (power-law)
distribution up to length scale ξ and repeats, statistically,
at length scales larger than ξ.

Whenever the lattice is ﬁnite, R < ∞, the number
of nodes is ﬁnite, N ∼ Rd, which imposes a maximum
connectivity,

K ∼ mN 1/(λ−1) ∼ Rd/(λ−1),

(11)

These three length scales, R, ξ, rmax, determine the
nature of networks. If the lattice is ﬁnite, then the max-
imum connectivity K is attained only if rmax < ξ. Oth-
erwise (rmax > ξ), the cutoﬀ kc is imposed. As long as
min(rmax, ξ) ≪ R, the lattice size R imposes no serious
restrictions. Otherwise (min(rmax, ξ) ≥ R), ﬁnite-size ef-
fects bounded by R becomes important. In this regime,
the simulation results [22] [23] have also shown that for
larger λ the network resembles the embedding lattice be-
cause of the rare long-range links, while the long-range
links becomes noticeable as λ decreases.

Concurrently with the above work, Warren et al. [24]
have proposed a similar embedding algorithm in a two-
dimensional lattice. As shown in Fig. 3, the number of
nodes in each circle is equal to the connectivity without
cutoﬀ. Thus, the main diﬀerence in their approaches is
that a node can be connected to as many of its closest
neighbors as necessary, until its target connectivity is ful-
ﬁlled.

In addition, Ref. [25] has discussed the shortest paths
on d-dimensional lattices with the addition of an average
of p long-range bonds (shortcuts) per site, whose length
l is distributed according to Pl ∼ l−µ.

5

C. Space-ﬁlling networks

The third class is related to the space-ﬁlling packing in
which a region is iteratively partitioned into subregions
by adding new node and links.

1. Growing small-world networks

Let us consider the growing network with geographical
attachment preference [26] as a modiﬁcation of the SW
model [3]. In this network, from an initial conﬁguration
with m + 1 completely connected nodes on the circum-
ference of a circle, at each subsequent time step, a new
node is added in an uniform-randomly chosen interval,
and connects the new node to its m nearest neighbors
w.r.t distance along the circumference. Fig. 4 (left) il-
lustrates the case of m = 2. We denote n(k, N ) as the
number of nodes with degree k when the size (or time)
is N . At time N , a new node with degree m is added to
the network, and if it connects to a preexisting node i,
then the degree is updated by ki → ki + 1 with the equal
probability m/N to all nodes because of the uniform ran-
domly chosen interval.

Thus, we have the following evolution equation,

n(k, N + 1) =

1 −

n(k, N ) +

n(k − 1, N ) + δk,m,

m
N

(cid:17)

(cid:16)

where δk,m is the Kronecker delta. Note that considering
such equation for the average number of nodes with k
links at time N is called “rate-equation approach,” while
considering the probability p(k, ti, t) that at time t a node
i introduced at time ti has a degree k is called “master
equation approach” [2].

When N is suﬃcient large, n(k, N ) can be approxi-
mated as N P (k). In the term of degree distribution, we
obtain

P (k) =

for k ≫ m (P (k) = 0 for k < m), although it is not a

The growing small-world networks model [26] can be
extended from polygonal divisions on a circle to polyhe-
dral divisions on a sphere as shown in Fig. 4. We should
remark the extended model becomes a planar graph,
when each node on the surface is projected onto a plane
such as from a Riemannian sphere. It is nothing but a
random Apollonian network (RAN) [27][28], and also the
dual version of Apollonian packing for space-ﬁlling disks
into a sphere [29], whose hierarchical structure is related
to the SF network formed by the minima and transi-
tion states on the energy landscape [30]. The power-law

6

By the continuous approximation, we obtain the solution
P (k) ∼ k−γRA with γRA = (N△ + N )/N ≈ 3 for large
N . Fig. 5 (a) shows an example of RAN.

Moreover, in the deterministic version [29][31], ana-
lytical forms of the power-law degree distribution P (k),
clustering coeﬃcient ci, and the degree-degree correla-
tion knn(k) can be derived [29], since the calculations
are easier in the recursive structure without randomness
into subregions as shown in Fig 5 (b). Here, knn(k) is de-
ﬁned by the the average degree of the nearest neighbors

nological or biological networks and in social networks
that there exists two types of correlations, namely dis-
assortative and assortative mixings [32]. These types of
networks tend to have connections between nodes with
low-high degrees and with similar degrees, respectively.
The RAN shows the disassortative mixing [29].

Similarly, the analytical forms in the high-dimensional
both random [33] [34] and deterministic [35] Apollonian
networks have been investigated by using slightly diﬀer-
ent techniques. They are more general space-ﬁlling mod-
els embedded in a high-dimensional Euclidean space, al-
though the planarity is violated.

3. SF networks generated by selecting edges

Another modiﬁcation of the growing SW networks [26]
is based on random selection of edges [36] [37]. We clas-
sify them in the relations to the partitions of interval or
region as mentioned in 3.3.1 and a Voronoi diagram. The
following two models give typical conﬁgurations (see Fig.
6).

from an initial triangulation of square and (b) Deterministic
AN generated from an initial triangle of back lines. The red
and blue lines are added links at the ﬁrst and second steps,
respectively.

degree distribution has been analytically shown in the
RAN [27][28]. To derive the distribution P (k), we con-
sider the conﬁguration procedures of RAN as follows (see
Fig. 2(c)).

RAN-Step 0: Set an initial triangulation with N0

nodes.

RAN-Step 1: At each time step, a triangle is randomly
chosen, and a new node is added inside the triangle.

RAN-Step 2: The new node is connected to its three

nodes of the chosen triangle.

RAN-Step 3: The above processes in Steps 1 and 2 are
repeated until reaching the required size N .

Since the probability of connection to a node is higher
as the number of its related triangles is larger, it is pro-
portional to its degree as the preferential attachment.
Thus, we have the following rate-equation

n(k + 1, N + 1) =

n(k, N ) +

1 −

n(k + 1, N ),

(12)
where the number of triangles N△ (at the grown size or
time N ) is deﬁned as N△ = 2(N − 4) + 4 for an initial
tetrahedron, and N△ = 2(N −3)+1 for an initial triangle,
etc.

In the term of P (k) ≈ n(k, N )/N , Eq. (12) can be

rewritten as

(N +1)P (k+1) =

[36] is constructed as follows. Initially, the network has
three nodes, each with degree two. As shown in Fig. 6(a),
at each time step, a new node is added, which is attached
via two links to both ends of one randomly chosen link
that has never been selected before. The growth process
is repeated until reaching the required size N . Since all
nodes have two candidates of links for the selection at
each time, an exponential degree distribution has been
analytically obtained. If the multi-selection is permitted
for each link, it follows a power-law. The diﬀerence in
conﬁguration procedures for RAN is that, instead of tri-
angulation with adding three links, two links are added
at each step. We assume that the position of added node
is random (but the nearest to the chosen link) on a met-
ric space, although only the topological properties are
discussed in the original model [36].

In the growing spatial SF network [37] on a two-
dimensional space, m links whose center points are near-
est to an added new node (as guided by the dashed lines
in Fig. 6 (b)) are chosen at each time step. Both end
nodes of the nearest link(s) have an equal probability of
connection. If a Voronoi region [38] [39] for the center
points of links is randomly chosen for the position of new
node in the region [43], the selection of a link is uniformly
random, therefore the probability of connection to each
node is proportional to its degree. Then, we can ana-
lyze the degree distribution. Note that any point in the
Voronoi region is closer to the center (called generator
point) belong in it than to any other centers.

For the case of m = 1 as a tree, the number of node

with degree k is evolved in the rate-equation

(k − 1)
2t

n(k, t + 1) = n(k, t) +

n(k, t) + δk,1,
(13)
where n(k, t) denotes the number of nodes with degree
k, and 2t is the total degree at time t.

n(k − 1, t) −

In the term of degree distribution P (k, t) ≈ n(k, t)/t

k
2t

at time t, Eq. (13) is rewritten as

(t + 1)P (k, t + 1) − tP (k, t) =

[(k − 1)P (k − 1, t) − kP (k, t)] + δk,1.

At the stationary value independent of time t, we have

P (k) =

[(k − 1)P (k − 1) − kP (k)] + δk,1.

From the recursion formula and P (1) = 2/3, we obtain
the solution

P (k) =

P (k − 1) =

k − 1

k(k + 1)(k + 2)

∼ k−3.

IV. RELATIONS AMONG THE MODELS

We discuss the relations among the independently pro-
posed models. Remember the summary of the geograph-
ical SF network models in Table I.

7

The ﬁrst class is based on a combination of the pref-
erential attachment or the threshold mechanism and the
penalty of long-range links between nodes whose posi-
tion is random, while the second one is on embedding
the SF structure with a given power-law degree distri-
bution in a lattice. Since the assigned degree to each
node can be regarded as a ﬁtness [2], the SFL is con-
sidered as a special case of the ﬁtness model [20] em-
bedded on a lattice. In contrast, the penalty of age or
distance dependence of each node can be regarded as a
non-ﬁtness in general term. If we neglect the diﬀerence
of penalties, this explanation bridges the modulated BA
[14][19], SFL [22][23], and aging models [40] with a gen-
eralized ﬁtness model. The crucial diﬀerence is the posi-
tioning of nodes: one is randomly distributed on a space
and another is well-ordered on a lattice with the mini-
mum distance between nodes. Moreover, the weight in
the threshold graphs [18][21] is corresponded to a some-
thing of ﬁtness, however the deterministic threshold and
the attachment mechanisms should be distinguished in
the non-growing and growing networks. We also remark
that, in the third class, the preferential attachment is im-
plicitly performed, although the conﬁguration procedures
are more geometric based on triangulation [27][28][29] or
selecting edges [37]. In particular, the position of nodes
in the Apollonian networks is given by the iterative sub-
divisions (as neither random nor ﬁxed on lattice), which
may be related to territories for communication or supply
management in practice.

Next, we qualitatively compare the properties of pla-
narity without crossing links and link lengths. We em-
phasize that the planarity is important and natural re-
quirement to avoid the interference of beam (or collision
of particles) in wireless networks, airlines, layout of VLSI
circuits, vas networks clinging to cutis, and other net-
works on the earth’s surface, etc [28].

In the modulated BA models and the geographical
threshold graphs, long-range links are restricted by the
strong constraints with decay terms, however crossing
links may be generated. There exist longer links from
hubs in the SFL, because such nodes have large num-
ber of links however the positions of nodes are restricted
on a lattice; the density of nodes is constant, therefore
they must connect to some nodes at long distances. More
precisely, it depends on the exponent λ of power-law de-
gree distribution as mentioned in the subsection 3.2. In
addition, the planarity is not satisﬁed by the crossing be-
tween the lattice edges and the short-cuts. On the other
hand, RAN has both good properties of the planarity
and averagely short links. However, in a narrow triangle
region, long-range links are partially generated as shown
in Fig. 5. Similarly, the SF networks generated by se-
lecting edges may have long-range links as shown in Fig.
6 (b): the chosen end point for connection is long away
from the newly added node at a random position, even
though the selected edges have the nearest centers.

V. CONCLUSION

geographical SF networks and discussed the above prop-
erties, however these are still at the fundamental level.
We must consider further issues, for example,

In this review of geographical SF network models, we
have categorized them in three classes by the genera-
tion rules: disadvantaged long-range links, embedding
on a lattice, and space-ﬁlling. We have shown that these
models have essential mechanisms to generate power-law
degree distributions, whose analytical forms can be de-
rived on an assumption of the restricted link lengths as
consistent with real data. Furthermore, the basic topo-
logical properties of the planarity and link length have
been discussed for each model.
In particular, the geo-
graphical threshold graphs and the RAN are attractive
because of the tunable exponent γ of P (k) ∼ k−γ or
the locality related to the unit disk graphs, and the pla-
narity of network on the heterogeneous positioning of
nodes. However, they have drawbacks of crossing and
long-range links, respectively. To avoid long-range links,
an improvement by the combination of RAN and Delau-
nay triangulation based on diagonal ﬂipping [38][39] is
considering [41].

We have grasped several conﬁguration procedures of

• Quantitative investigation of the topological prop-
erties including diameter of network, clustering co-
eﬃcient, degree-degree correlation, and between-
ness centrality (related to congestion of information
ﬂow), etc.

• Analysis of dynamics for the traﬃc and the fault-
tolerance, especially in disaster or emergent envi-
ronment.

• Positioning of nodes with aggregations according
to a population density in the evolutional and dis-
tributed manners.

We will progress to the next stage from the observation
of real networks to the development of future networks.
The distributed design and management will be usefully
applied to many socio-technological infrastructures.

[42] To simplify the discussion, we assume an uniformly ran-
dom distribution of nodes on a space. However, the pro-
cedure can be generalized to any other distributions.
[43] Although the position of node is randomly selected on
it
a two-dimensional space in the original paper [37],
is modiﬁed to the random selection of a Voronoi re-
gion which is related to triangulation such as in RAN.
Note that it gives a heterogeneous spatial distribution of
points.

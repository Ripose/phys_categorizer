Abstract

A simple spatial computer simulation model was recently intro-
duced to study the evolution of the linguistic diversity [1]. The model
processes of selective geographic colonization, linguistic
considers
anomalous diﬀusion and mutation.
In the approach, we ascribe to
each language a ﬁtness function which depends on the number of peo-
ple that speak that language. Here we extend the aforementioned
model to examine the role of saturation of the ﬁtness on the language
dynamics. We found that the dependence of the linguistic diversity
on the area after colonization displays a power law regime with a non-
trivial exponent in very good agreement with the measured exponent
associated with the actual distribution of languages on the Earth.

1 Introduction

The research in language dynamics has arose an increasing interest of the
complex systems community in the last years. Most of the researchers focus
their investigations on issues like rise, competition, extinction risk and death
of languages [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. Furthermore, recent advances
in archeology, genetics and linguistics have provided relevant contributions
to a better comprehension of the linguistic diversiﬁcation [12, 13]. Some
investigations have demonstrated that distinct causes have greatly aﬀected
the evolution of the linguistic diversity. Among the main elements are geo-
graphic factors, economic features, complexity of the language, to cite just
a few. For instance, Sutherland [2] has shown that beside country area, for-
est area and maximum altitude contribute to increase diversity, whereas the
diversity decreases for a larger latitude. According to Bellwood [14, 15] and
Renfrew [16, 17] the occurrence of agricultural expansion was the responsible
for the massive population replacements initiated about 10,000 years ago and
caused the disappearance of many of the Old World languages.

In a recent work, we investigated the evolution of the linguistic diver-
sity by introducing a spatial computer simulation model that considers a
diﬀusive process which is able to generate and sustain the diversity [1]. The
model describes the occupation of a given area by populations speaking sev-
eral languages. To each language was assigned a ﬁtness value f which is
proportional to the number of sites colonized by populations that speak that
language. In the process of colonization, language mutation or diﬀerentia-
tion and language substitution can take place, which aﬀords the linguistic
diversity. This simple model gives rise to scaling laws in close resemblance
with those reported in [18].

In the current contribution, we study the dynamics of the linguistic di-
versity but now we assume that the ﬁtness of each language is bounded by a
given maximum (saturation) value which is randomly chosen from an uniform
distribution. The saturation hypothesis mimics factors like the diﬃculty/ease
of learning the languages and economy that permit some languages to prop-
agate more easily than others.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we introduce the model.
In Section 3 we discuss the results. And ﬁnally, in Section 4 we present the
conclusions.

2 Model

Our model is deﬁned on a two-dimensional lattice of linear size L, and com-
posed of A = L×L sites with periodic boundary conditions. Each lattice site
si represents a given region, which can be occupied by a single population
speaking just one language. We ascribe to each site a given capability Ci,
whose value we estimate from a uniform distribution, deﬁned in the interval
0-1. The capability means the amount of resources available to the popula-
tion which will colonize that place. It is implicit that the population size in
each cell si is proportional to its capability Ci.

In the ﬁrst step of the dynamics, we randomly choose one site of the lattice
to be colonized by a single population that speaks the ancestor language.
Each language is labeled by an integer number. As soon as a new language
arises, it is labeled by the next upper integer. To each language, we assign a
ﬁtness value f , which is calculated as the sum of the capabilities of the sites
which speak that speciﬁc language. But now diﬀerently from reference [1],
the ﬁtness can not exceed an integer value γk which we have chosen to be
in the range 1-2000. This saturation term γk is randomly chosen when the
language k appears. Thus, the initial ﬁtness of the ancestor language is the
capability of the initial site.

In the second step, one of the four nearest neighbors of the site containing
the ancestor language will be chosen to be colonized with probability pro-
portional to its capability. We assume that regions containing larger amount
of resources are most likely to be colonized faster than poor regions. The re-
ferred site is then occupied by a population speaking the ancestor language
or a mutant version of it. Mutations are the mechanisms responsible for
generating diversity, and together with the natural selection mantains the
standing level of diversity on the system. The probability of occurrence of
a mutation in the process of propagation is p = α
f , where α is a constant,
and so the mutation probability is inversely proportional to the ﬁtness of the
language. The form of the mutation probability p is inspired by population
genetics, where the most adapted organisms are less likely to mutate than
poorly adapted organisms [19]. The probability of producing reverse muta-
tions is zero, that is, the language generated by a mutation is always diﬀerent
of the previous ones.

In the subsequent steps, we check the empty sites which are located on
the boundary of the colonized cluster, and we then choose one of those empty
sites according to their capabilities. Again, those sites with higher capabili-

ties enjoy of a greater likelihood to be occupied. After that, we choose the
language to be incorporated in the chosen cell among those languages oc-
cupying the neighboring sites. Languages with higher ﬁtness have higher
chance to expand. The process continues while there are empty sites in the
network. After completion, we count the total number of languages D. In
order to give to the reader some insight about our model, in Figure 1 we
present the snapshot for a typical realization of the dynamics at the ﬁrst
moment of colonization of all sites (in this ﬁgure the gray scale represents
diﬀerent languages). The striated linguistic domains presenting very small
territories occupied by diﬀerent languages shown in Figure 1 remind us the
actual distribution of languages observed in the Caucasus region between
Black and Caspian Seas, a relatively small area of 300,000 km2 where lan-
guages of the Caucasic, Indo-European and Altaic families coexist distributed
within a large variety of peoples [13].

3 Results and Discussion

In Figure 2, we show the diversity D as a function of the area A (total number
of sites in the lattice) for mutation parameter α = 0.3 and saturation values
deﬁned in the interval 1-2000. The points are averages over 100 independent
simulations when L < 400 and over 20 simulations when L = 500. We
observe that the curve presents just one scaling region which extends over
ﬁve decades. The exponent z = 0.39 ± 0.01 is in quite satisfactory agreement
with the exponent observed for the actual distribution of languages on Earth.
For sake of completeness, we also exhibit in Figure 2 the observed values (∗)
of diversity versus area obtained in reference [18] for all languages spoken
on Earth (the ten data points are associated with the interval from A = 50
km2 to A = 107 km2 of the actual distribution). We notice in passing that
although there is not a perfect scaling relationship between diversity and
area along ﬁve decades in area, both the simulation and the actual data of
D(A) curiously seem to be modulated by a similar tendency to oscillate in
respect to the main scaling behavior (the deviations from perfect scaling in
the actual data have no connection with the choice of the bins). We have also
investigated the situation at which the saturation value is the same for all
languages. We have noticed a linear growth of the diversity with area when
the maximum γ is very small. For large values of γ we notice the existence of
two scaling regions. For very large values of γ we recover the result obtained

for the case where the ﬁtness are not limited [1].

Figure 3 displays the number of languages with population size greater
than N, n(> N), as a function of N. In order to obtain the curves, we have
assumed that the population in a given site is proportional to the capability
in the site. We have considered that the population in a given site is its
capability multiplied by a factor 100. In the plot, the values of the parameters
are L = 500 and α = 0.3. In close analogy with the distribution of languages
on Earth [18], we ﬁnd two distinct scaling regimes n(> N) ∼ N −
τ : τ =
0.35 ± 0.01 for 200 < N < 2, 000, 000, and τ = 1.14 ± 0.01 for 2, 000, 000 <
N < 10, 000, 000. The inset exhibits the diﬀerential distribution of languages
spoken by a population of size N, n(N). This distribution also agrees with the
one observed for languages on Earth [18, 2]; in particular it is well described
by the lognormal function n(N) = 1
N exp (cid:2)− 1
(cid:3), with σ =
0.41 and µ = 0.42 (continuous curve in the inset).

4 Conclusions

We have introduced a model for evolution of linguistic diversity that con-
siders a bounded ﬁtness value for languages. We have considered a random
chosen value of saturation of the ﬁtness for each language in order to mimic
the fact that diﬀerent languages have diﬀerent conditions to propagate. We
have noticed a considerable improvement of the results when compared to
the earlier approach [1]. Now, the relationship between diversity and area
presents just one scaling regime. For α = 0.3 we obtain z = 0.39 ± 0.01,
which is in very good agreement with the exponent observed for the lan-
guages on the Earth [18], along ﬁve decades of variability in area. We have
also observed that the exponents τ for the two power law regimes in n(> N)
as a function of N are closer to those obtained by empirical observations [18].
In order to compare other kinds of saturation conditions, we have also
studied the case where the saturation values are the same for all the lan-
guages. With this condition, we could not reproduce the basic relationship
between diversity and area observed for the actual distribution of languages,
although for the very particular and unrealistic case where α = 0.01 and
γ = 1, we can perfectly reproduce the diﬀerential distribution of languages
spoken by a population of size N, n(N), as well as the number of languages
with population size greater than N, n(> N), as a function of N. Our re-
sults seem to demonstrate that diﬀerent assumptions on the behavior of the

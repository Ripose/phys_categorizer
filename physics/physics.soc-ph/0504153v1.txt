Summary. Various multi-agent models of wealth distributions deﬁned by micro-
scopic laws regulating the trades, with or without a saving criterion, are reviewed.
We discuss and clarify the equilibrium properties of the model with a constant global
saving propensity, resulting in Gamma distributions, and their equivalence to the
Maxwell-Boltzmann kinetic energy distribution in an eﬀective number of dimensions
(related to the saving propensity) [M. Patriarca, A. Chakraborti, and K. Kaski, Phys.
Rev. E 70 (2004) 016104]. We use these results to analyze the model in which the
individual saving propensities of the agents are quenched random variables, and the
−α−1 with
tail of the equilibrium wealth distribution exhibits a Pareto law f (x) ∝ x
an exponent α = 1 [A. Chatterjee, B. K. Chakrabarti, and S. S. Manna, Physica
Scripta T106 (2003) 367]. Here, we show that the observed Pareto power law may
be explained as arising from the overlap of the various Maxwell-Boltzmann distribu-
tions associated to the various agents, which reach an equilibrium state characterized
by their individual Gamma distributions.

1 Introduction

‘A rich man is nothing but a poor man with money’ — W.C. Fields.

If money makes the diﬀerence in this world, then it is perhaps wise to
dwell on what money, wealth and income are, to study models for predicting
the respective distributions, how they are divided among the population of
a given country and among diﬀerent countries. The most common deﬁnition

2

Patriarca, Chakraborti, Kaski, Germano

of money suggests that money is the “Commodity accepted by general con-
sent as medium of economics exchange” [1]. In fact money circulates from one
economic agent (which can be an individual, ﬁrm, country, etc.) to another,
thus facilitating trade. It is “something which all other goods or services are
traded for” (for details see Ref. [2]) . Throughout history various commodi-
ties have been used as money, termed usually as “commodity money” which
include rare seashells or beads, and cattle (such as cow in India). Since the
17th century the most common forms have been the metal coins, paper notes,
and book-keeping entries.

However, this is not the only important point about money. It is worth
recalling the four functions of money according to standard economic theory:

(i) to serve as a medium of exchange universally accepted in trade for goods

and services

(ii) to act as a measure of value, making possible the determination of the

prices and the calculation of costs, or proﬁt and loss

(iii) to serve as a standard of deferred payments, i.e., a tool for the payment
of debt or the unit in which loans are made and future transactions are
ﬁxed

(iv) to serve as a means of storing wealth not immediately required for use.

Another main feature which emerges from these properties and which is rele-
vant from the point of view of the present investigation is that money is the
medium in which prices or values of all commodities as well as costs, proﬁts,
and transactions can be determined or expressed.

As for the wealth, it usually refers to things that have economic utility
(monetary value or value of exchange), or material goods or property. It also
represents the abundance of objects of value (or riches) and the state of having
accumulated these objects. For our purpose, it is important to bear in mind
that wealth can be measured in terms of money.

Finally, income is deﬁned as “The amount of money or its equivalent re-
ceived during a period of time in exchange for labor or services, from the sale
of goods or property, or as proﬁt from ﬁnancial investments” [3]. Therefore, it
is also a quantity which can be measured in terms of money (per unit time).
Thus, money has a two-fold fundamental role, as (i) an exchange medium
in economic transactions, and (ii) a unit of measure which allows one to quan-
tify (movements of) any type of goods which would otherwise be ambiguous to
estimate. The similarity with e.g., thermal energy (and thermal energy units)
in physics is to be noticed. In fact, the description of the mutual transfor-
mations of apparently diﬀerent forms of energy, such as heat, potential and
kinetic energy, is made possible by the recognition of their equivalence and
the corresponding use of a same unit. And it so happens, that this same unit
is also the traditional unit used for one of the forms of energy. For example,
one could measure energy in all its forms, as actually done in some ﬁelds
of physics, in degree Kelvin. Without the possibility of expressing diﬀerent
goods in terms of the same unit of measure, there simply would not be any

quantitative approach to economy models, just as there would be no quanti-
tative description of the transformation of the heat in motion and vice versa,
without a common energy unit.

2 Multi-agent models for wealth distributions

In recent years several works have considered multi-agent models of closed
economy [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. Despite their simplicity, these models
predict a realistic shape of the income distribution, both in the low income
part, usually described by a Boltzmann distribution, as well in the tail, where
a Pareto power law was observed a century ago by the Italian social economist
Pareto [13]: the wealth of individuals in a stable economy follows the distribu-
α, where F (x) is the upper cumulative distribution function,
tion, F (x) ∝ x−
that is the number of people having wealth greater than or equal to x and
α is an exponent (known as the Pareto exponent) estimated to be between 1
and 3.

In such models, N agents exchange a quantity x, which has been inter-
preted sometimes as money and that will be considered here to represent
wealth, under suitable hypotheses discussed below. The states of agents are
characterized by the wealths {xn}, n = 1, 2, . . . , N . The evolution of the
system is then carried out according to a prescription, which deﬁnes the trad-
ing rule between agents. The evolution can be interpreted both as an actual
time evolution or a Monte Carlo optimization procedure, aimed at ﬁnding the
equilibrium distribution. At every time step two agents i and j are extracted
randomly and an amount of wealth ∆x is exchanged between them,

x′i = xi − ∆x ,
x′j = xj + ∆x .

(1)

It can be noticed that in this way the quantity x is conserved during the single
transactions, x′i + x′j = xi + xj. Here x′i and x′j are the agent wealths after the
transaction has taken place. Several rules have been studied for the model.

2.1 Basic model without savings: Boltzmann distribution

In the ﬁrst version of the model, so far unnoticed in the literature, the money
diﬀerence ∆x is assumed to have a constant value [4, 5, 6],

∆x = ∆x0 .

(2)

This rule, together with the constraint that transactions can take place only
if x′i > 0 and x′j > 0, provides a Boltzmann distribution, see the curve λ = 0
in Fig. 1.

Alternatively, ∆x can be a random fraction of the money of one of the two

agents,

4

Patriarca, Chakraborti, Kaski, Germano

∆x = ǫxi or ∆x = ǫxj ,

where ǫ is a random number uniformly distributed between 0 and 1.

Also, a trading rule in which there is a random redistribution of the sum
of the wealths of the two agents has been introduced by Dragulescu and
Yakovenko [7],

x′i = ǫ(xi + xj) ,
x′j = ¯ǫ(xi + xj) ,

∆x = ¯ǫxi − ǫxj .

where ¯ǫ is the complementary fraction of unity deﬁned by the random number
ǫ, i.e. ǫ + ¯ǫ = 1. Equations (4) are easily shown to correspond to the trading
rule (1), with

In the following we will concentrate on the latter version of the model and its
generalizations, though all the versions of the basic model lead to an equilib-
rium Boltzmann distribution, given by

,

where the eﬀective temperature of the system is just the average money
[4, 5, 6, 7]. This result is found to be extremely robust, in that it is largely
independent of various factors. Namely, it is obtained for the various forms of
∆x mentioned above, for a pair-wise as well as multi-agent interactions, for ar-
bitrary initial conditions [8], and ﬁnally, for random or consecutive extraction
of the interacting agents.

The Boltzmann distribution thus obtained has been sometimes referred to
as an “unfair distribution”, in that it is characterized by a majority of poor
agents and a very few rich agents, signaled in particular by a zero mode and
by the exponential tail.

2.2 Minimum investment model without savings

Despite the Boltzmann distribution is very robust respect to the variation
of some parameters, the way it depends on the details of the trading rule is
actually subtle. For instance, in the model studied in Ref. [9], the equilibrium
distribution can have a very diﬀerent shape. In that model it is assumed that
both the economic agents i and j invest the same amount xmin, which is
taken as the minimum wealth between the two agents, xmin = min{xi, xj}.
The wealths after the trade are x′i = xi + ∆x and x′j = xj − ∆x, where
∆x = (2ǫ − 1)xmin.

We note that once an agent has lost all his wealth, he is unable to trade
because xmin has become zero. Thus, a trader is eﬀectively driven out of the
market once he loses all his money. In this way, after a suﬃcient number of
transactions only one trader survives in the market with the entire amount of
money, whereas the rest of the traders have zero money.

2.3 Model with constant global saving propensity: Gamma
distribution

A step toward generalizing the basic model and making it more realistic, is
the introduction of a saving criterion regulating the trading dynamics. This
can be practically achieved by deﬁning a saving propensity 0 < λ < 1, which
represents the fraction of money or wealth which is saved – and not reshuﬄed
– during a transaction. The dynamics of the model is as follows [8, 9]:

with ¯ǫ = 1 − ǫ, corresponding to a ∆x in Eq. (1) given by

x′i = λxi + ǫ(1 − λ)(xi + xj ) ,
x′j = λxj + ¯ǫ(1 − λ)(xi + xj) ,

∆x = (1 − λ)[¯ǫxi − ǫxj] .

This model leads to a qualitatively diﬀerent equilibrium distribution. In par-
ticular, it has a mode xm > 0 and a zero limit for small x, i.e. P (x → 0) → 0,
see Fig. 1. The functional form of such a distribution has been conjectured
to be a Gamma distribution on the base of an analogy with kinetic theory
of gases, which is consistent with the excellent ﬁtting provided to numerical
data [14, 15]. Its form can be conveniently written by deﬁning the eﬀective
dimension Dλ as [15]

and the corresponding temperature, according to the equipartition theorem
hxi = DλTλ/2, as

i.e. a Gamma distribution of order Dλ/2. For integer or half-integer values
of n = Dλ/2, this function exactly gives the equilibrium Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution of kinetic energy for a system in thermal equilibrium, at tempera-
ture Tλ in a Dλ-dimensional space (see Appendix A for a detailed derivation).
This extension of the equivalence between kinetic theory and closed economy
models to values λ ≥ 0 is summarized in Table 1.

This equivalence between the multi-agent system with a saving propensity
λ ≥ 0, and an N -particle system in a space with an eﬀective dimension Dλ ≥
2, was originally suggested by simple considerations about the kinetics of a
collision between two molecules. In fact, during such an event only a fraction
of the total kinetic energy can be exchanged for kinematical reasons. Such a
fraction is of the order of 1 − λ ≈ 1/D, to be compared with the expression
1 − λ = 3/(D/2 + 2) derived from Eq. (9) [15].

While λ varies between 0 and 1, the parameter Dλ monotonously increases
from 2 to ∞, respectively, while the eﬀective temperature Tλ correspondingly
decreases from hxi to zero, see Fig. 2.

It is to be noticed that according to the equipartition theorem only in
Dλ = 2 eﬀective dimensions (λ = 0) the temperature coincides with the
average value, Tλ = 2 hxi /2 ≡ hxi, as originally found for the basic model
[4, 5, 6, 7]. In its general meaning, temperature represents rather an estimate
of the ﬂuctuation of the quantity x around its average value. The equipartition
theorem always gives a temperature smaller than the average value hxi for a
number of dimensions larger than two. In the present case, Eqs. (9) or (10)
show that this happens for any λ > 0.

The dependence of ﬂuctuations of the quantity x on saving propensity λ
was studied in Ref. [8]. In particular, the decrease in the amplitude of the
ﬂuctuations with increasing λ is shown in Fig. 3.

8

Patriarca, Chakraborti, Kaski, Germano

The fact that in general the market temperature Tλ decreases with λ means
smaller ﬂuctuations of x during trades, consistently with the saving criterion,
i.e. with a λ > 0. One can notice that in fact Tλ = (1 − λ) hxi /(1 − λ) ≈
(1 − λ) hxi is of the order the average amount of wealth exchanged during a
single interaction between agents, see Eqs. (7).

2.4 Model with individual saving propensity: Pareto tail

In order to take into account the natural diversity between the various agents,
a model with the individual propensities {λi} as quenched random variables,
was studied in Refs. [10, 11]. The dynamics of the model is as follows [10, 11]:

x′i = λixi + ǫ[(1 − λi)xi + (1 − λj)xj ] ,
x′j = λxj + ¯ǫ[(1 − λi)xi + (1 − λj )xj ] ,

(13)

(14)

where, as above, ¯ǫ = 1 − ǫ. This corresponds to a ∆x in Eq. (1) given by

∆x = ¯ǫ(1 − λi)xi − ǫ(1 − λj )xj .

Besides the use of this trading rule, a further prescription is given in the
model, which is necessary in order to obtain a power law at large x. A ran-
dom assignment of individual saving propensities {λi} is initially done. With
this given conﬁguration {λi}, the system is then evolved until equilibrium
is reached. Then a new set of random saving propensities {λ′i} is extracted
and are reassigned to all the agents and the whole procedure is repeated many
times. As a result of the average over the equilibrium distributions correspond-
ing to the various conﬁgurations, one obtains a distribution with a power law
tail, f (x) ∝ x−

1 with a Pareto exponent α = 1.

3 Further analysis of the model with individual saving
propensity

The model with individual saving propensity relaxes toward a power law dis-
tribution, only with the prescription mentioned above. This model contains
as particular cases the models with a global saving propensity λ and the basic
model with λ = 0, which instead relax toward a Gamma distribution and
an exponential (Boltzmann) , respectively. However, we will illustrated here,
that a superposition of diﬀerent exponential tails arising from such Gamma
distributions, and their overlap produces a power law.

3.1 The x-λ correlation

A key point which explains many of the features of the model and of the
corresponding equilibrium state is a well-deﬁned correlation between average

(dotted line) is constant, which conﬁrms the hypothesis expressed by Eq. (16). The
ratio hx(λ)i /∆x(λ) (continuous line), with ∆x(λ) =

zero for λ → 1, showing that ∆x(λ) grows slower than hx(λ)i. This explains the
origin of the structures at large values of x visible in Figs. 6 and 7 (see text for
details).

wealth and saving propensity, which has been unnoticed so far in the literature
[16]. The existence of such a correlation can also clarify the paradox, according
to which a very rich agent may lose all the wealth when interacting with some
poor agents, given the stochastic character of the trading rule Eq. (13).

Fig. 4 shows the equilibrium state for a system with N = 1000 agents
after t = 109 trades. Each agent is represented through a circle (◦) in the
wealth-saving propensity xi-λi plane. The correlation between wealth x and
saving propensity λ is observed to become very high at large values of x and
λ. Namely, one observes that the average wealth hx(λ)i (crosses (×) in Fig.
4), diverges for λ → 1. The average hx(λ)i was obtained by computing the
dxdλP (x, λ) = 1)
normalized probability density P (x, λ) in the x-λ plane (
and then carrying out an ensemble average for a ﬁxed value of λ,

dx xP (x, λ) .

(15)

The observed correlation naturally follows from the structure of the trade
dynamics (13). Let us consider that intially everyone has the same wealth
x0. At the beginning, when all agents have approximately the same wealth
x0, an agent i with a large saving propensity λi can save more – on average –
and therefore accumulates more. Afterwards, the agent i will continue to enter
trades by investing only a small fraction (1−λi)xi of the wealth xi in the trade.
Even when interacting with an agent j, with a smaller wealth xj < xi, agent i
may still be successful in the trading since agent j may have a smaller saving

explanation of this mechanism.

propensity λj, so that the fraction of wealth traded (1− λj)xj is comparable if
not larger than (1 − λi)xi. Trading will very probably be successful for agent
i until an agent j is met, characterized by a value of (1 − λj )xj smaller than
(1 − λi)xi. These considerations suggest that agent i will reach equilibrium
(and his maximum wealth allowed) when (1 − λi)xi = κ ≈ h(1 − λ)xi. The
j(1 − λj)xj /N
ratio between the constant κ, and the average h(1 − λ)xi =

however, shown as a continuous line in Fig. 4, provides an excellent inter-
polation of the average wealth hx(λ)i found numerically (also shown in the
ﬁgure).

3.2 Variation of a single agent’s wealth

The stability of the asymptotic state is also shown by the x(t+1)-x(t) plot, see
Fig. 5, showing the histogram of the wealths x(t + 1) after, versus x(t) before,
a trade. The distribution is more narrow at larger than at smaller values of
x, implying that that the probability that an agent i will undergo a large
relative variation of the wealth xi within a single trade is much higher for

Kinetic theory models for the distribution of wealth

poor agents. The situation at small x (corresponding to agents with smaller
saving propensities) is instead more similar to that of the trading rule without
saving propensity (λ = 0), Eqs. (7): The distribution is broader, indicating a
higher probability of a large wealth reshuﬄing during a trade.

3.3 Power laws at small x and t scales

A peculiarity of the model of Ref. [10] is noteworthy: On one hand in the
procedure used to obtain a power law all agents are equivalent to each other,
since they enter the dynamical evolution law on an equal footing, all their
saving propensity are reassigned randomly with the same uniform distribu-
tion between 0 and 1, and even their initial conditions can be set to be all
equal to each other, xi = x0, without loss of generality. The various equilib-
rium conﬁgurations, corresponding to diﬀerent sets {λi}, are then expected
to be statistically equivalent to each other, in the sense that one should be
able to obtain the power law distribution by a simple ensemble average for
any ﬁxed saving propensity conﬁguration {λi}, if the number of agents N
is large enough. On the other hand, the averaging procedure over the {λi}
conﬁgurations is in practice necessary for obtaining a power law distribution.
In order to understand this apparent paradox, we checked how the equi-
librium distributions, corresponding to a given saving propensity set {λi},
look like. One ﬁnds that the every conﬁguration {λi} produces equilibrium
distributions very diﬀerent from each other, see Fig. 6 for some examples.
In particular, one can observe diﬀerent structures, with well resolved peaks
at large values of x, therefore distributions looking very diﬀerent from power
laws. Only when an averaging over diﬀerent {λi} conﬁgurations is carried out,
one obtains a smooth power law with Pareto exponent α = 1.

These same ﬁgures show, however, that for a given conﬁguration {λi} a
power law is actually observed but only at small values of x. Another related
interesting feature of simulations employing a single saving propensity conﬁg-
uration {λi} is that a power law distribution is found only on a limited time
scale, while it disappears partly or totally at equilibrium. Thus also in the
time dimension one surprisingly ﬁnds a distribution much more similar to a
power law at a smaller rather than larger scale. This is shown in the example
in Fig. 7, where the distributions of a system of 1000 agents are compared
with each other at four diﬀerent times.

These features suggest that the power law is intrinsically built into the
dynamical laws of the model but that, for some reasons, it fades away at large
space (x) and time scales. The x − λ correlation discussed above in Sec. 3.1
can provide an explanation of these features, both for those in the x and in
the time dimension, as discussed later.

3.4 Origin of the power law

The procedure introduced in Ref. [10] and used to obtain the power law dis-
tribution in the model with individual saving propensities may seem to deﬁne

Fig. 6. Equilibrium conﬁgurations corresponding to four diﬀerent random saving
propensity sets {λi} for a system with N = 1000 agents. The diﬀerences between the
various distributions are evident especially at large values of x, where the distribution
deviates from a power law.

a dynamical process at ﬁrst sight, since the system is brought out of equi-
librium from time to time by the reassignment of the saving propensities.
Correspondingly, one may attribute the power law shape to the underlying
dynamical process, as it happens often in nonequilibrium models, such as e.g.
models of markets evolving on a network [17].

However, it turns out that this power law represents a real equilibrium
state. The Pareto law with exponent α = 1 actually arises as the overlap of
equilibrium Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions of subsystems, made up of those
agents with the same (or a similar) value of λ. This can be seen by considering
partial distributions, i.e. the x distributions of subsystems consisting of agents
with a given λ. Since the agent saving propensities are obtained through a
random extraction, for numerical reasons we consider subsystems deﬁned by
a window ∆λ around given value λ.

Fig. 8 shows the partial distributions for the ten subsystems obtained by
dividing the λ space from λ = 0 to λ = 1 into ten slices of width ∆λ = 0.1.
All these partial distributions have an exponential tail. Only when they are
summed up, their overlap reproduces a power law, as qualitatively shown by
the envelope of the curves.

Thus the averaging procedure over the conﬁgurations {λi} is an eﬀective
way to carry out the numerical optimization for ﬁnding the equilibrium dis-

Fig. 7. Time evolution of the distribution of a system with N = 1000 agents (after
about t = 2 × 106, 3 × 106, 5 × 106, and 2 × 107 trades). The distribution shows

structured distribution with isolated peaks at large x, while approaching equilibrium.

tribution in practical computations. The procedure is in fact not needed in
principle, since the power law can be obtained also when a single conﬁgu-
ration of saving propensities {λi} is used, as long as properly deﬁned. The
breaking of the power law takes place when the distance between the peaks
corresponding to to consecutive agents i and i + 1 becomes comparable with
the peak width.

In turn, this explains the origin of the peaks visible in the plots in Figs.
6 or 7 at large x. Due to the high wealth-saving propensity correlation at
large values of x, these peaks are to be put into correspondence with agents
with high λi. The reason why these agents give rise to peaks rather than
contributing to extending the power law tail is that, due to the divergence
of hx(λ)i with λ (see Fig. 4), the corresponding average values hxiλi of the
saving propensity become very high and at the same time far from each other
for λ → 1. If agents are labeled from i = 1 to i = N and are ordered with
increasing λ, i.e. λ1 < λ2 < . . . < λN , the distance between two generic
consecutive values of hx(λ)i corresponding to λi and λi+1 is, for a uniform λ
distribution (δλ = λ1+1 − λi = const),

distributions of the richest agents (i.e. with the highest saving propensity) will
show as peaks which can be resolved from the background.

Also the time evolution peculiarities mentioned in Sec. 3.3 can be explained
invoking the x-λ correlation. In fact on one hand agents with larger λi’s end
up being richer, since the asymptotic wealth hxii ∝ 1/(1 − λi). On the other
hand the ﬂux through the system in any trade is of the order of xi(1 − λi),
which is smaller for agents with a larger λi if at the beginning of the simulation
all {xi} are equal, xi = x0, or at most the same for all agents if the system is
near equilibrium (see Eq. (16)). Correspondingly one expects larger relaxation
times for larger λ’s, a result indeed found in the numerical simulations of
the multi-agent model with ﬁxed global saving propensity (see Fig. 2 in Ref.
[8]). The longer relaxation time of agents with large λi will make their own
distribution peak appear at large x only at equilibrium (last frame in Fig.
7). At intermediate times, their average value has not reached the asymptotic
value yet and their distribution will be spread at smaller values of x, thus
contributing to smoothen the overlap of the various distributions and produce
a better power law (ﬁrst frame in Fig. 7).

3.5 Checking diﬀerent λ distributions

It is possible for the overlap of partial distributions to produce a smooth power
law as far as a cut-oﬀ xmax, if the λ distribution is dense enough as far as a
λmax, where xmax ≈ hx(1 − λ)i /(1 − λmax).

A practical way to avoid the appearance of the peaks at large x and obtain
a distribution closer to a power law is to increase the density of agents, espe-
cially at values of λ close to 1. In a random extraction of {λi}, it is natural
that the values of λi will not be equally spaced and even small diﬀerences
in the spacing will be ampliﬁed at large x and will result in the appearance
of peaks. A deterministic assignment of the λ, e.g. a uniform distribution
achieved through the following assignment,

λi =

i
N

,

i = 0, N − 1,

(18)

can still be considered to be a uniform distribution of λ in the interval (0,1)
but will generate a much smoother distribution. The comparison of the results
for this distribution with those for a random distribution of λ is done in Fig.
10. One can notice that in the uniform case not only the power law extends to
higher values of x but also that the distribution of peaks at large x is globally
smoother, in the sense that the single peaks follow on average a power law
better.

4 Conclusions

We have reviewed some multi-agent models for the distribution of wealth, in
which wealth is exchanged at random in the presence of a saving criterion

quantiﬁed by the saving propensity λ. We have shown how a distribution of
λ generates a power law distribution through the superposition of exponen-
tial distributions corresponding to particular subsets of agents. The physical
picture for the model with individual saving propensities is thus more similar
to that of the model with constant global saving propensity than it may seem
at ﬁrst sight. In fact any subset of agents with the same value of the saving
propensity λ equilibrate in a way similar to agents in the model with global
saving propensity, i.e. according to an exponential wealth distribution. Corre-
spondingly we have shown that both the noise in the power-law tail and the
cut-oﬀ in the power-law depend on the coarseness of the λ distribution. This
extends the analogy between economic and gas-like systems, not only to the
case beyond the case of a global λ > 0, characterized by a Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution, but also to arbitrary continuous distributions in λ which span
the whole interval λ = (0, 1).

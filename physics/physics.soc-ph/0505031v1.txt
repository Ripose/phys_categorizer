Abstract

We study corruption as a generalized epidemic process on the
graph of social relationships. The main diﬀerence to classical epidemic
processes is the strong nonlinear dependence of the transmission prob-
ability on the local density of corruption and the mean ﬁeld inﬂuence
of the overall corruption in the society. Network clustering and the
degree-degree correlation play an essential role in corruption dynam-
ics. We discuss phase transitions, the inﬂuence of the graph structure
and the implications for epidemic control. Structural and dynamical
arguments are given why strongly hierarchically organized societies
like systems with dictatorial tendency are more vulnerable to corrup-
tion than democracies. A similar type of modelling can be applied
to other social contagion spreading processes like opinion formation,
doping usage, social disorders or innovation dynamics.

1 Introduction

Corruption seems to be an unavoidable part of human social interaction,
prevalent in every society at any time since the very beginning of human his-
tory till today. In sharp contrast to the high prevalence of corruption in many

countries and the rather large literature on political, social and economical
aspects of corruption there is only a small number of attempts to model the
dynamics of corruption in a mathematically quantiﬁed way. The modelling
approach in these few attempts essentially follows two paths. The ﬁrst is in
the sense of microeconomics and incorporates game theoretic aspects (for a
recent model in this direction see the book by Steinr¨ucken [17] and the ref-
erences therein) or rules for maximizing a certain economically based proﬁt
functional ([16][10]). Then a set of diﬀerential equations for the evolution of
the mean corruption is derived and a stability analysis done on that basis. In
these models one usually makes rather detailed assumptions about the under-
lying organization structure on which the individuals interact. The second
line of approach is more in the sense of cellular automata (CA) models with
rather simple state variables and local interaction dynamics. For example in
the article by Wirl [19] a simple 1-dimensional deterministic cellular lattice
automata model is used to describe the propagation of corruption. Never-
theless, as is well known in CA-modelling, the global dynamical picture can
be highly complex and nontrivial.

Up to now all these attempts did not take into account the complex
network of social relationships as the underlying structure for the spread of
corruption. In this article we will present a model for the spread of corruption
on complex networks in the spirit of epidemiology. The model describes
aspects of the evolution of corruption in a virtual population and incorporates
some basic universal features of corruption. The local interaction dynamics
of the model is similar to cellular automata but ”lives” not on a lattice type
graph like most of the CA-models but on complex networks.

Considering corruption as a nonstandard epidemic process relies on the
plausible assumption that corruption rarely emerges out of nothing but is
usually related to some already corrupt environment which may ”infect” sus-
ceptibles. Of course the spontaneous decision of somebody to act corruptly is
possible and could easy be handled in the model as an external weak source of
infection. One of the very special features in corruption propagation which
diﬀers from what is used in describing classical epidemic processes is the
threshold like dependence of the local transition probabilities. By this we
mean that a noncorrupt individual gets infected with high probability if the
number of corrupt individuals in the group of his direct social contacts (en-
coded as the set of neighbors in a ”friendship” or acquaintance graph) exceeds
a certain threshold number. Otherwise if the number of corrupt individuals
in somebodies social neighborhood is below that threshold value there is only

2

a small probability to get corrupt via such ”local” interactions. The second
main diﬀerence to classical epidemic processes is the mean ﬁeld dependence
of the corruption process. By this we mean that an individual can get cor-
rupt just because there is a high prevalence (or believed prevalence) in the
society even when there is no corruption in the local neighborhood. There
is another interesting mean ﬁeld term entering the game, namely the society
strikes back to corruption with an eﬃciency proportional to the fraction of
the noncorrupt people. Both mean ﬁeld terms are nonlinear and together
with the local propagation mechanisms they give rise to a rather complex
dynamical picture.

2 What is corruption?

Corruption is a substructure of human social interaction. Common sense
associates corruption mainly with a deviation from fair play interaction in the
development of social relations. Clearly what is meant be fair play depends
on the cultural context of a given population/society. This vague description
of corruption is in the spirit of sociology and psychology and diﬀers from the
more narrow corruption concepts usually considered in economics or political
sciences. There, corruption is mainly seen as a misuse of public power to gain
proﬁt in a more or less illegal way. In any case, corruption has many diﬀerent
faces in its concrete appearance and no single model approach will be able to
describe the whole picture in an adequate way. But this does not at all imply
that mathematical models are useless in this situation. They can provide a
substantial improvement in our understanding of corruption as long as one
clearly deﬁnes the aim and limitations of the taken approach.

For the model approach developed in this article we will use the notion
of corruption in the more general, ﬁrst sense. More precisely our intention
is to describe changes in mind ranging from damming of corruption as a
criminal act to accepting corruption as an attractive option. Therefore in
this paper we do not introduce the group of state representatives or oﬃcials
since we assume that the essential changes in mind which allow corrupt acts
happen long before an individual is in the position to act corruptly. Empir-
ical investigations about motives and ”typology” of corrupt actors (see [3]
for results from case studies in Germany) have shown that the majority of
individuals involved in corruption aﬀairs are highly educated, well positioned
with respect to social status and do not think to have done something wrong,

There is a notorious problem in ﬁnding good empirical data which would
allow to estimate the prevalence of corruption. Probably the greatest eﬀort
over the last years to measure the degree of corruption in various countries
was made by ”Transparency International” (TA), a non proﬁt group of in-
dividuals and organizations which are highly concerned by the lack of sound
data. Since 1995 they publish a yearly corruption report and a so called
Corruption Perception Index (CPI) [18]. TA is well aware of the subjectivity
in peoples perception of corruption but hopes that the large number of cases
involved in the CPI averages out most of the bias. Figure 1 gives a CPI-rank
plot of the 2004 date from TA. Note that a value of 10 for the CPI corre-
sponds to the absence of corruption. For 2004 Finland holds the top ranking
and Germany is on place 15 with an index of 8.2.

It is not our aim to explain the values of the CPI or other corruption
data sets, since this would require a semirealistic modelling of the social and
economical structure of individual countries which is completely illusionary
at the present stage of research. Rather we want to demonstrate which
scenarios are dynamically possible and whether there are phase transitions.

3 Corruption as a generalized epidemic pro-

cess

In this section we ﬁrst describe the basic setting for our model structure.
Reﬁnements and more detailed aspects will be discussed later on. Due to the
common view, corruption is ﬁrst of all a property of the relations between
individuals irrespectively which deﬁnition of corruption one uses. Since an
act of corruption requires that at least one of the participants in a corrupt
relation has a mental state which tolerates or even assigns a positive value
to (his personal view of) corruption we will focus mainly on the spread of
this mental state change (from not accepting to accepting corrupt acts as
an option for one’s own activities). Therefore to discuss corruption as an
epidemic process in the afore mentioned sense it is useful to assign a cor-
ruption property to the individuals themselves. In the simplest case we just
1 state variable ω (x, t) assigned to each indi-
have a time dependent 0
vidual, encoding whether the vertex is corrupt (1) or not (0) at time t (of
course more reﬁned scales for the degree of corruption are possible and will
be discussed in a forthcoming paper). The underlying structure on which
corruption spreads is a given ﬁnite graph G from a random graph space
G
with ﬁxed vertex set V =
. Furthermore we consider in this arti-
cle only stationary graphs with no changes in time on the underlying graph
structure (the study of corruption on evolutionary graphs requires a paper
in its own). The dynamics is speciﬁed by conditional transition probabilities
(pij (x)) which depend mainly on the states on B1 (x) =
and
a meanﬁeld term reﬂecting the inﬂuence of the total prevalence of corruption
in the society. Here d (., .) is the usual graph metric on G
and d (x) is
the degree of x. We deﬁne bt := 1

in other words the probability to become corrupt depends only on the local
prevalence of corruption among the neighbors and the mean corruption in
the society and individuals who became corrupt can cure from corruption
with a rate proportional to the density of the noncorrupt individuals in the

5

−

society. In classical i.i.d. epidemics one would have the following as functional
dependence for the local part of the conditional probabilities: f (k) = 1
−
ε)k which is for small ε and k proportional to εk. For corruption the
(1
function f is more like in voter models, that is below a critical value ∆ (x)
of the number of corrupt individuals in B1 (x) the value of f is close to
zero and above ∆ (x) it is a number α (x) much larger then zero. Due to this
property local clustering can force the epidemics to spread whereas in classical
epidemic processes high clustering slows down the spread of an infection due
to reinfection of the already infected. We want to illustrate this by two simple
examples.

Example 1 The simplest, almost trivial example is the Z1 lattice with addi-
tional edges to the next-nearest neighbors. Setting f (1) = µ > 0 and f (i) = 1
for i > 1 it is easy to see that there is a nonzero probability for infecting all
vertices starting with one infected individual at time 0.

Example 2 The infection function f will be the same as in example 1. We
start with a regular tree of degree 3. Replacing each vertex by a triangle and
gluing the triangles along the former edges of the regular tree gives a regular
graph of degree 4 where the triangle corners act now as the new vertices. In
each neighbor pair of triangles (A, B) (that are the triangles which have a
common vertex) we form an edge randomly between the set of vertices lying
in A
A (see Fig. 1). Once a triangle is infected the corruption
jumps to all the three neighbor triangles due to the extra random edge present
between each neighbor pairs of triangles. Hence again we have a nonzero
probability that the whole graph becomes infected.

B and B

\

\

In the above examples we have used a very simple and somehow extreme
form of the infection function f. In the following we will investigate the
situation for two canonical subclasses of infection functions. We say that
f is a vertex independent, ﬁxed threshold infection function if there is a ∆
such that f (i) = ε for 0 < i < ∆ and f (i) = α
∆. For the
second class of functions we assume the threshold to be degree dependent.
Namely we call fx a vertex dependent, relative threshold function if for some
(0, 1) we have fx (i) = ε for 0 < i < δd (x) and f (i, x) = α
δ
ε for
δd (x). Furthermore we say that f is a voter-type infection function if
i
f (i, x) = ε for i <
and f (i, x) = α for i
. In this paper
we will mainly investigate the spread of corruption for the ﬁxed threshold
case.

Note that in contrast to standard voter models we do not have the possi-
bility of a locally induced backﬂip from the corrupt state to the noncorrupt.
A kind of quenched disorder could easily be introduced by randomizing the
relevant parameters individually but this will be the subject of a forthcom-
ing paper. Generalizations of classical epidemic dynamics to processes with
a local threshold have recently also been studied in the context of models of
contagion (see [9] and references therein) but not yet been mixed with global

mean ﬁeld processes.

4 The structure of social networks

In the last 10 years there has been an enormous progress in understanding
the ﬁne structure of social networks. This is mostly due to the availability of
large data sets for some special social networks like E-mail correspondence,
coauthorship network in scientiﬁc publications and movie actor networks to
name just a few prominent examples. All these networks of social relations
share three remarkable properties of the associated graph which are: 1) the
diameter scales at most logarithmically in size 2) the graphs have a very
high, asymptotically non-vanishing clustering coeﬃcient- in other words the
graphs are locally far from being tree-like 3) the degree distribution follows a
power law (scale-free graphs). Properties 2 and 3 have striking consequences
for the spread of corruption as will be discussed later on.

There exists meanwhile a large collection of algorithms to generate com-

plex networks with the above mentioned properties.

triangles containing x
}
{

A widely used quantity to measure the local clustering is the triangle
and it’s averaged value ¯A. A
number A (x) := #
natural generalization is the k
clique number Ck (x) deﬁned as the number
of complete graphs of order k containing x. In social network graphs A (x) is
usually proportional to d (x) and ¯A becomes independent of the population
size for large N and stays bounded away from zero. Another very remarkable
property of real networks is the power-law distribution for the degree. By an
asymptotic power-law distribution for a discrete random variable d we denote
= k−λ+ok(1) with exponent
every functional behavior of the form Pr
λ > 1. Most real networks have exponents between 2 and 4 (see [1] for an
excellent overview). Classical epidemic processes on such graphs have been
studied by many authors, and perhaps the most astonishing result in this
context is the absence of an epidemic threshold in case the exponent is below
3 ([15]). This phenomenon is related to the existence of a massive center of
size independent diameter induced by the high number of hubs (vertices with
an exceptional large degree). Hubs play also a signiﬁcant role for α - process
as will be explained in the next section.

d = k

}

{

One of the main diﬀerences between corruption epidemics and classi-
cal epidemics is the diﬀerent eﬀect of clustering on the epidemic threshold
and the total number of infected individuals. In the classical situation any

8

epidemics will be slowed down by the presence of local cycles due to the
high probability of reinfection. In corruption epidemics local clustering may
speed up the propagation of corruption due to the nonlinear dependence of
the infection probability on the number of infected neighbors as was already
demonstrated in example 1 in the previous section. In the next section we
will give two further examples where the strength of this eﬀect can explicitly
be computed.

5 Phase transitions for the α - process

−

−

In this section we want to look at some threshold properties associated to the
α
process. We are still far from a good understanding of the quantitative
picture of this kind of processes for a given type of graph, which is mainly a
consequence of our lack of knowledge how to handle graphs with high local
clustering in a mathematical satisfactory way. In this section we want to state
just some general observations and numerical results concerning the spread of
threshold-like dynamics. Furthermore we will analyze two examples of tree-
like graphs which might serve as an illustration. A more careful mathematical
analysis of α

processes requires a paper in its own.

One of the remarkable diﬀerences between a classical epidemic process and
a process based on local threshold dynamics is the dependence on the initial
number of ”infected” vertices in the latter case. Classical epidemics does not
know such things- either an epidemic process is overcritical (reproduction
number R0 > 1) and a single initial infected vertex infects with with positive
probability a positive fraction of the whole population, or the process is below
criticality (R0 < 1) and all infected will die out respectively become healthy.
In corruption epidemics both parts - the mean ﬁeld process as well the local
α
process - can have phase transitions with respect to the initial number
of corrupt vertices. That means, there is critical initial density of corrupt
vertices bc
0 the number of infected stays
as it is or goes down to zero. Above bc
0 the entire population becomes corrupt
with high probability. As an illustration we give in Fig. 3 the dependence of
0 on the edge density M

N vertices and M edges.

over 20 runs.

There is still a critical density but its value increases with the edge density
since the mean threshold increases now proportional to the mean degree. As
already mentioned in section 3 one expects that the presence of clustering
(respectively many triangles) decreases the critical density bc
0 since the α-
process can propagate more easily. In Fig. 5 the eﬀect of the increase of the
(N, M) random
triangle number is clearly to see. Here we used a modiﬁed
graph space where randomly triangles are added (keeping the total number
of edges constant). The threshold value ∆ was chosen to be 2 since for higher
∆ one has to add higher order complete subgraphs instead of triangles.

G

The next ﬁgure (Fig. 6) shows the dependence of the critical density on
∆. The two curves represent the threshold values for an end-prevalence of 10
respectively 90 percent. Since the mean degree in this simulation is about 6.5
one has a vanishing contribution of the α- process above ∆ = 8. The critical
threshold bc
0 stays than essentially at a value given by the mean ﬁeld process
(see next section for details). To get an impression of the contribution of the
diﬀerent kind of processes (local α and ε, global β and γ - for details see next
section) to the end-prevalence we give in Fig. 7 the accumulated number of
state changes caused by each of the subprocesses till saturation. For small
values of ∆ the α- process dominates all others.

We turn now to a more theoretical consideration, namely which type of
vertices (type in the sense of degree and local clustering) are especially well
suited for the propagation of corruption via the α
process. Assume we have
with N vertices. We further as-
given a random scale free graph space
sume that there are two types of edges (according to the way they where
generated) the independent ones, generated at random with just preferences
to the degree (like the preferential attachment rule by Albert&Barabasi or
the ”Cameo-Principle” in [4]) and local ones which are relevant for the cre-
ation of triangles. Let further the (asymptotic) degree distribution given
by ϕ (k) := Pr
k0 and B (k0) the normal-
ization constant. The independent edges are generated with probability p0
and each individual generates k0 > 2 edges by himself. From [4] one knows
that the triangle number A (x) is proportional to d (x) with a proportion-
ality constant C (p0). A basic quantity in highly clustered networks is the
probability q (x) that two random chosen elements from N1 (x

dependence gets negative and hence the high degree vertices contribute
almost nothing to the Clique-clustering. Of course all this consideration rely
on the assumption of some kind of independence in the triangle-formation
process. In any case this results indicate that highly clustered medium degree
vertices are especially well suited for the spread of corruption. A similar kind
of analysis can be carried out for random graph models which have an intrin-
sic high probability to generate local cliques e.g. intersection graphs (for an
introduction to random intersection graphs and comparison with Erd¨os-Renyi
random graphs see [12] and [11]). The above arguments seem to support the
conjecture that in corruption epidemics the vertices from the tail of the de-
gree distribution play a less dominant role. This is indeed true in the case of
a relative, degree-dependent threshold where hubs are much more diﬃcult to
infect than medium or low degree vertices. For absolute thresholds in the α-

Fig.8 and Fig.9 we give numerical results for the relation between the critical

0 and the exponent λ keeping the edge density ﬁxed. There is a
clear phase transition around λ
2.9 for ∆ = 2. The
explanation of this observation is closely related to a structural phase tran-
sition in scale free random graphs at λ = 3 - namely that for most vertices
x an asymptotically positive fraction of all vertices has bounded distance to
x. To link this property with the α - process one has to look more closely on
the degree-degree correlation in scale-free graphs. Depending on the choice
of the model one can have very diﬀerent correlations like:

we conjecture that the diﬀerence to the numerical results depicted in Fig.8
(phase transition at λ < 2.3 instead of 3) is due to ﬁnite size eﬀects.
In
the case of ∆ = 2 (Fig.9) the ﬁnite size eﬀects are smaller and the phase
transition is closer to 3. A similar kind of arguments shows, that the expected
path-length is ﬁnite for λ < 3. Namely since the expected number Sl of

that this expression is only valid for l s.t. (l−1)(3−λ)

diameter diame (a large fraction if the whole vertex set is within a ball of
diameter diame) is then given by the smallest l such that (l−1)(3−λ)
> 1 (for
a more extensive discussion of the notion of essential diameter see [5]). For
λ = 2 one obtains therefore diame = 3. For λ > 3 the essential diameter is no
longer bounded but growths logarithmically in N. It is interesting that the
jump in the critical density at 2.3 in Fig.8 coincides with a jump in diameter
from 4 to 5. A small essential diameter can have fatal consequences for
corruption epidemics since most vertices are closely linked to hubs and, as was
outlined above, hubs are with high probability corrupt. A precise estimation
of the dependence of bc
0 from N, M and λ requires a careful discussion of the
involved constants. For scale-free graphs with additive degree correlation
like Cameo-graphs one still has a bounded essential diameter for exponents
less than 3. But the ﬁrst argument about chains of almost sure linkages
from high degree to low degree vertex sets can not be adopted. One expects
therefore a higher value of the critical density bc
0. In Fig.10 and Fig. 11 we
give numerical results for a scale-free graph with additive degree-correlation

x and makes than a random matching between the virtual vertices. Two vertices x and y
are connected by an edge if there is an edge between two corresponding virtual vertices.
To generate an additive degree correlation we mark M virtual vertices as red such that
each vertex x has at least one red and at most C
red associated virtual vertices (if
there are note too many vertices with very small degree, the constant C can be choosen
M

Finally we will discuss two examples of graph structures where the critical
infection density can be explicitly be computed. The ﬁrst one is a regular
inﬁnite tree of degree 4 where of course no triangles are present (see Fig. 12).

. The second structure is a regular inﬁnite graph of again of degree 4 with
positive local cluster coeﬃcient (A (x) = 2) and a global tree-like structure
(see Fig.13).

In both cases an exact computation of the critical infection density is
possible. We give a short outline for the case of threshold value ∆ = 2
and α = 1 (the case α < 1 requires more lengthy computations but can
be done in a similar fashion) and start with the case of the regular 4 tree.
An initial conﬁguration is given by marking each vertex with probability p
p as corrupt (white). We
as noncorrupt (black) and with probability 1
ask for the critical probability pc such that for p < pc almost surely the
entire tree becomes white (corrupt) and for p > pc there remains an inﬁnite
cluster of noncorrupt (black) vertices with probability one. Note that no
ﬁnite cluster of black vertices -that is a ﬁnite black subgraph surrounded by
white vertices- can survive so there are either inﬁnite black clusters or none.

generalized tree; the grey 
vertices were initially black 
but got eventually corrupt 
(local threshold =2) 

Figure 13: Segment of an inﬁnite generalized tree (degree 4 and branching
number 3)

We call an invariant inﬁnite black cluster immune. Since ∆ = 2 any vertex
in an immune cluster must have at least three black neighbors from that
cluster. Denote by TR (3) the rooted tree with outdegree 3 (ﬁxing a root
gives a canonical direction to the edges of the tree so it makes sense to speak
about the outdegree of a vertex). Every vertex has degree 4 except the root
which has degree 3. Let x be the p
dependent probability that the root is
contained in an immune cluster (as a subgraph of TR (3)) conditioned that
the root vertex is initially black. By arguments from the general theory of
branching processes x equals the largest solution of the following recursion

In a similar fashion one can derive a recursion equation for the generalized
tree case. For that let TR (2, 1) be the rooted generalized tree shown in Fig.15.
To every vertex is attached an outgoing triangle, hence the degree of a vertex
is 4 except the root which has degree 2. To settle the question about pc for the
original generalized tree it is enough to analyze the corresponding problem

A careful reader may have noticed that there is a big structural diﬀerence
between the generalized tree in example 2 of section 3 and the generalized
tree just discussed above. Namely the graph of the ﬁrst example has the
property, that any two vertices can be linked by a chain of triangle where
neighbor triangles always have a common edge. The graphs in the examples
of this section do not have this property since neighboring triangles have only

21

cliques have a k

a common vertex. For threshold values ∆ > 2 one has to consider chains of
∆ + 1 cliques. We say that a graph is well k -linked if any pair of vertices can
be linked by a chain of complete graphs of order k such that all neighboring
1- clique in common. For well k- linked graphs the
k
−
critical density b0
c is zero (a ﬁnite number of initially infected vertices can
already infected a positive fraction of the vertex set) for α
processes with
∆ < k whereas for graphs which are not well linked one needs a positive
critical density.

−

The above study on trees or generalized trees is insofar important as in
most random graph models used for complex networks one has as a tree or
generalized tree as the typical local structure around a random chosen vertex.
Furthermore the dependence of the corruption dynamics on graph properties
like edge density or degree distribution is in large parts of the parameter
space entirely caused by the α
process.

In this section we want to have a closer look at the mean ﬁeld dependence
of the corruption process. To gain some insight in the possible type of be-
havior we start with some simple assumptions which will be reﬁned later
on. Again we will argue in a discrete time model but the transition to
continuos time makes no problem and gives the same results. Let bt the
density of corrupt people at time t. We assume that the aﬃnity for an indi-
vidual to change its behavior from noncorrupt to corrupt increases propor-
tional to the corruption prevalence. Furthermore to become really corruptly
minded an individual has to overcome some fear which we put proportional
= βb2
to (1

−
with β
[0, 1]. Corrupt individuals can recover due to state and police ef-
fects (uncovering, fear etc.). Again it seems reasonable to assume that the
bt since only the noncorrupt
probability to recover is proportional to 1
part of a society is willing to ﬁght corruption. Formally we will assume that

bt). Formally this reads as Pr

with the two obvious ﬁxed points 0 and 1. For β
= 0 there is a third interme-
diate ﬁxed point b∗ := γ
β . An interesting phenomena happens for parameter
pairs (β, γ) s.t. γ < β since under this conditions both ﬁxed points at 0
and 1 are locally stable. Hence there are two basins of attraction- one for 0
with b∗ as the boundary point. In other words, if the initial
and one for 1
percentage of corruption is less b∗ corruption stays under control whereas for
an initial value larger b∗ things run out of control and a corruption collapse
takes place. Of course this mean ﬁeld part of the model is still very simplistic
and one should not expect any quantitative ﬁt with empirical data. But the
qualitative statement seems to be quite stable with respect to modiﬁcations.
For instance there are good reasons to believe that neither the mean ﬁeld
infection nor the mean ﬁeld recover process are linear in bt.

We want to end this section with a small modiﬁcation of the mean ﬁeld
”Ansatz” where we include social weights. This is a natural and meanwhile
very common approach in network dynamics and can easily be adopted to
the corruption model. In the above argumentation on the attraction of be-
coming corrupt it is plausible to assume that corrupt individuals with high
social inﬂuence have a stronger inﬂuence on the mean ﬁeld probability to
get corrupt than individuals with low social importance. A similar argument
holds for the recover probability. As a simple measure for social strength we
use the degree of the vertices since high degree vertices are more likely to
play a dominant social role than low degree vertices. Formally we introduce
the weighted density bw

t at time t as

bw

I (k)

where dk is the number of vertices with degree k and I (k)

which is the same as equation (11). Therefore the introduction of social
weights does not add anything new to the dynamical picture. There is of
course a diﬀerence in the interpretation since a small real initial prevalence of
corruption can give rise to a high initial value of bw
0 as soon as the corruption
is concentrated at the high degree vertices. Here also a diﬀerence between
scale free networks and classical random networks is seen since in the scale
free case high degree vertices (hubs) are much more frequent than in the
classical case.

7 Interaction between the mean ﬁeld process
and the local threshold dynamics (β +γ ver-
sus α)

In this paragraph we will investigate some aspects of the interplay between
the mean ﬁeld process described in the previous section and the local, thresh-
old dependent, corruption propagation. For α > γ there is a core infected
component generated via the α
process. To gain some insight how such
a core infected part of the population changes the mean ﬁeld dynamics we
will assume that a certain fraction, say a, of the population is permanently
a
deletion process. Denoting by qt = bt −
infected and resistant to the γ
−
the density in the noncore part of the population (the normalization here is
still with respect to the total population size) we get the following mean ﬁeld
dynamics:

note that the derivative at qt = 0 is always positive for the relevant param-

evolution scenarios are the same for a = 0 and a

strong inﬂuence of a on the parameter regimes of β and γ for which one has
a corruption collapse. Whereas in case a = 0 one is always in the basin of
attraction of zero for b0 suﬃciently small and γ
= 0 (in other words b = 1
is never a global attractor) one can now have the phenomenon that only the
complete saturation with corruption is stable ( q = 1
a). As an example
lets look at the case where β = 2γ. For a = 0 there is a ﬁxed point at
b∗ = 0.5 and hence for an initial infection density b0 < 0.5 the pure mean

ﬁeld dynamics converges to zero.
only the stable ﬁxed point b∗ = a + q∗ = 1. At a = 1/8 there is a phase
transition since a new indiﬀerent (slope 1) ﬁxed point at b∗ = 1/4 emerges.
For a < 1/8 this ﬁxed point bifurcates into two ﬁxed points where the ﬁrst
one at b∗ = 1

vided by N) caused by the α, β, γ and ε- process at initial density values
slightly above the critical one. Up to an edge density of 2 (corresponding
to a mean degree of 4) the β
process gives the major contribution to the
end prevalence in the overcritical situation. Parallel to the increase in the
edge density increases the contribution of the α- and ε- process (in the in-
termediate phase of density between 2 and 3 dominated by the α- process)
till a sharp peak at edge density 4.5 where the ε
process outperforms all
the others (at the same time the critical initial corruption density bc
0 drops
down and becomes almost zero). The peak is easy to understand since for
the chosen parameters we have at an edge density of 4 an equality between

8 Single run simulation results

In this section we want to present some simulation results of the corruption
process taking place on some medium size complex networks. Small graph
sizes are interesting as they are typical for communities in highly social struc-
tured populations. As a simple to generate random graph space with high
clustering and power law degree distribution we have chosen so-called inter-
section graphs. Intersection graphs can easily be deﬁned as follows. First
one forms random sets from a ﬁnite base set of N elements (random means
in this context that the set elements are chosen uniform i.i.d. from the base
set). These sets constitute the vertices of a random graph. Edges will be
deﬁned via the set intersection property, namely there is an edge between i

the structure of random intersection graphs see [7][12][11]. It is worth noting
that intersection graphs have a high clustering by deﬁnition (if an element is
contained in say k sets simultaneously this k sets form a complete subgraph).
Most simulations were done for the case when ϕ is an asymptotic power law
distribution with exponent 3 or when ϕ is singular (all sets have the same
size). Random intersection graphs have a multiplicative degree correlation
and therefore the critical threshold should be very low for exponents less
than 3 be the arguments from section 5. Above that value the form of the
degree distribution has only little inﬂuence on the corruption propagation.

Besides random intersection graphs generated according to some degree
speciﬁcations we used also a collection of real collaboration graphs. These
graphs come from a database about research and development projects funded
by the European Community (FP2-3). It’s vertices are organizations involved
in European research projects. Two organizations are linked if they have a
joint project (see table II for the main graph characteristics). In total the data
base contains about 8000 projects and 13000 participating organizations. In
essence the network shows all the main characteristics that are known from
other complex network structures like scale free degree distribution (with
exponent between 2 and 3), small diameter and high clustering and vertex
correlation. The initial fraction of infected individuals was either distributed
at random over the vertex set or clumped together in a suﬃciently large ball

The network
FP3 is extremely high clustered (mean degree = 48.6, mean triangle number
= 418 and a total of 7710 nodes and 187704 edges) and stays metastable
with a very small corruption cluster for about 200 updates till it jumps
by a factor 10 to another metastable state. Fig.19 gives a more detailed
view of the accumulated contributions by the diﬀerent processes for a time
interval around the jump in prevalence. In the initial phase the ε
process
was dominating the β
process and vice versa in the second phase. The
next pictures show a situation where after an initial phase of slow growth
a corruption collapse happened. It seems that the absolute threshold value
∆ = 20 is well below the critical value where the system can still stabilize.

Figure 26: Process splitting for the situation from Fig.24

It is surprising that the system semi-stabilizes after an initial rapid increase
in the prevalence for a rather long time (Fig.20). To a certain extend the
results can be explained along the argumentation in section 7. In Fig.22 the
accumulated infection processes for the initial phase are shown. Here the
ε- process, although undercritical, causes a redistribution of infection till a
clustered conﬁguration is reached such that the α- process can start. Than
the systems stays in almost complete balance till the β
process (which is
slow in all our examples) wins (Fig.21). Note the diﬀerence to Fig.19, where
the β
process never really contributes to the infection. Finally we show
two simulations for a sample of a random set graph model with about 1000
vertices (Fig.23 and Fig.24). Although both prevalence curves look similar
there is a clear diﬀerence in the process ﬁne-structure (Fig.25 and Fig.26).
In the ﬁrst instance the ε
process are causing the collapse whereas
in the second case the α
process is the
main booster.

The few examples of single simulation runs given in this section show
already, that there are many diﬀerent routes to obtain high prevalence in
corruption typically interrupted by long phases of metastability. Similar to
other complex systems with hidden phase transitions (e.g. the climate) there
can be an unnoticed small accumulation of infection till a critical density- a
point of no return- of corruption is reached from which on an almost com-
plete saturation of the society (or a corresponding subsystem) by corruption
becomes the normality.

9 Epidemic control

One of the basic question in classical epidemics as well as in corruption
dynamics is: what can be done to slow down the ”infection” propagation or
prevalence. Knowing the diﬀerent phase transitions and their dependency
on structure properties and social parameters is of great help in designing
proper prevention scenarios. In the following we will try to relate some of
the ﬁndings from our model to what is considered by practicians as useful
in corruption reduction. First we would like to emphasize again that the
present model deals in a rather abstract way with the propagation of mental
willingness to be corrupt and not so much with realized corruption which
always requires a speciﬁc environment and additional structural assumptions.
Hence concerning corruption control, we only will be able to support certain
prevention scenarios in the sense, that they go into the right direction and
that there eﬀect is strong or weak but without being able to make quantitative
statements.

The model presented in this paper contains, besides structural parameters
for the underlying network, 5 relevant parameters: α- characterizing the
strength of the local threshold process, β- characterizing the strength of the
mean ﬁeld attraction on becoming corrupt, γ- the strength of the ”society
strikes back” term, ε- the strength of the classical epidemic process (assumed
to be very small) and ∆- the height of the local threshold. Three of the
parameters- α, β and ε- are positively correlated to the spread of corruption
whereas 2 parameters- ∆ and γ- are negatively correlated. As is well known
from classical epidemic control for infectious diseases it is very hard if not
impossible to change basic social parameters in a short time. This can only
be achieved in a long running educational process. Therefore not much can
be done in avoiding high clustering in certain relevant areas of the society in
order to prevent the emergence of highly connected corruption nets.

As the name already indicates, Transparency International favours as an
eﬀective tool to decrease corruption especially the increase of transparency
in all forms of administrative decision making as well as transparency in ﬁ-
nancial aﬀairs of socially exposed persons, institutions and companies. The
eﬀect of an increase of transparency translates into our model as an increase
of the value of ∆ and a decrease of the values of β, α and ε. Strengthening
of justice, police and similar instruments to ﬁght and uncover corruption has
again the eﬀect of lowering β (via increase of fear) but may also increase the
value of γ (uncovering rate). Since an increase of γ above the value of β and

34

α would perhaps require a total police state, it is illusionary to overcome cor-
ruption just by means of law, justice and police. Besides necessary long term
educational eﬀorts in school and public to strengthen the moral resistance
against corruption (increase of ∆ and decrease of α) it seems a good strategy
to make administrative and political decision hierarchies as independent and
decentralized as possible to avoid high clustering.

−

We would like to end these short remarks by a few comments on the role
of hubs - the very high degree vertices typically present in scale free graphs -
in corruption dynamics. While a priori not especially well suited to transmit
corruption via the α
process due to the local tree like structure around the
hubs (compared with low degree vertices) they nevertheless are more often
exposed to corruption and have therefore a higher probability to get corrupt.
If the hub density is suﬃciently high (as is the case for scale-free degree
distributions with exponent λ < 3) and the degree correlation is stronger
than additive many vertices are linked to the hubs via social dependencies
and in turn also can get corrupt. Furthermore they may play a fatal role
in increasing the weighted corruption density relevant for the mean ﬁeld
process as was explained at the end of section 7. The described situation
is probably typical for strongly hierarchically organized countries or regional
substructures e.g. systems with a dictatorial or monarchical tendency.
In
such societies a high prevalence of corruption seems almost unavoidable since
the threshold bc
0 is close to zero. For democratic societies it seems therefore
wise, to watch the behavior of hubs- whatever their social interpretation
might be- more intensively than the ”normal” part of the society.

10 Summary and perspectives

In this article we have presented a ﬁrst study of the spread of corruption
on scale free and highly clustered networks. One of the main observations
so far is the strong dependence of the asymptotic dynamics on the initial
number of corrupt individuals. This holds as well for the mean ﬁeld process
as for the local dynamics. Second there is a fatal resonance eﬀect between
global and local dynamics lowering dramatically the critical density of initial
infection. As expected there is a positive correlation between clustering and
spread of corruption respectively the critical initial density. Scale-freenes
seems to play an important role for the corruption process for distributions
with small exponent (λ < 3) and multiplicative degree correlation due to

35

the high prevalence of infected hubs and the strong linkage of medium and
low degree vertices to them. For higher exponents the dynamics is rather
insensitive to the degree distribution. The strength of the degree correlation
(from weak - additive till strong - multiplicative or even higher powers) in
networks of social acquaintances seems to be related to the political and
institutional structure of a society which favours liberal organization forms
as being less vulnerable to corruption.

There is a whole bunch of natural continuations or generalizations which

have to be investigated next. Clearly a deeper understanding of the pure α
−
process and its phase transitions is necessary. The mathematical problem is
already highly nontrivial on trees. The following short list gives a selection
of natural generalizations and reﬁnements:

– quenched disorder in all parameters

– inclusion of geographical or regional structure into the network

– inclusion of administrative or political substructures in which corruption

typically will be realized

– evolving networks

– interaction between the corruption process and the network structure

– more heterogeneity in the social networks e.g. by incorporating family

like structures or social proﬁles

– weighted networks

– reﬁned transition rules e.g. asymmetry between infecting and getting

infected

– diﬀerent kinds and strength of corruption and their interplay

– economic impacts in a virtual population.

Besides the speciﬁc context of corruption dynamics there is a multitude
of topics where the model presented in this paper could easily be adopted
to. This includes so diﬀerent themes as political opinion formation, social
disorder processes, strategies for advertisement, doping usage, the spread
of prejudices, migration dynamics, global terrorist networks and innovation

36

processes. In all these examples one has a local and global dynamics very
similar to the one described here. Of course there are diﬀerences. For instance
in many mind formation problems the state space of individuals is rather
complex and the local dynamics allows for many transitions not just 0-1 as in
the corruption model. Furthermore aging phenomena and limits of resources
could be included. But besides this addition of structure and complexity
and the various interpretations there remains a good part of the ﬁndings of
this work to be true. There will be phase transitions in the initial density of
certain properties and there can be resonance eﬀects between the nonlinear
global and local dynamics - both making the prediction of future diﬃcult
and challenging.

Abstract. To our knowledge,
the populations are generally assumed to be
homogeneous in the traditional approach to evolutionary game dynamics. Here,
we focus on the inhomogeneous populations. A simple model which can describe
the inhomogeneity of the populations and a microscopic process which is similar
to Moran Process are presented. By studying the replicator dynamics, it is shown
that this model also keeps the ﬁxed points unchanged and can aﬀect the speed of
converging to the equilibrium state. The ﬁxation probability and the ﬁxation time of

are diﬀerent situations that characterize the time scale of evolution; and in each
situation, there exists an optimum solution for the time to the equilibrium points,
respectively. Moreover, these results on the speed of evolution are valid for inﬁnite
and ﬁnite populations.

1. Introduction

Evolutionary game theory has been successfully founded and applied to the study of
biology, economics, and social sciences by Maynard Smith [1]. Originally, evolutionary
game theory was formulated in terms of inﬁnite populations and the corresponding
replicator dynamics. Consider two strategies A and B in a population engaged in a
game with payoﬀ matrix

A typical assumption is that individuals meet each other at random in inﬁnitely large,
well-mixed populations. The ﬁtness (or payoﬀ) of A and B players are respectively given
by

The equilibrium points are either on the boundary or in the interior. There are four
generic outcomes [4, 5, 6]:
(1) If a > c and b > d then A dominates B; the only stable equilibrium is x = 1.
(2) If a < c and b < d then B dominates A; the only stable equilibrium is x = 0.
(3) If a > c and b < d then A and B are bi-stable; both x = 0 and x = 1 are stable
equilibria; there is an unstable equilibrium at x = (d
(4) If a < c and b > d then A and B co-exist; both x = 0 and x = 1 are unstable
equilibria; the only stable equilibrium is given by x = (d

The standard replicator dynamics hold in the limit of inﬁnite population size. In
fact, any real population has ﬁnite size and also computer simulations in structured or
unstructured populations always deal with ﬁnite populations [7, 8, 9, 10]. Therefore, it is
natural to study evolutionary game dynamics in ﬁnite populations. In most approaches
for ﬁnite population size, each individual interacts with each other individual in the well-
mixed, homogeneous populations. Moreover, stochastic processes have been introduced
to study evolutionary dynamics in ﬁnite populations. Recently,
in unstructured
ﬁnite populations diﬀerent mechanisms are applied to study game dynamics, such as
Moran Process, Pairwise Comparison Process, Wright-Fisher Process, local information,
mutation, discounting and active linking [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17].

To our best knowledge, in the aforementioned approaches to evolutionary game
theory, they are all based on the simplifying assumptions that the populations are
homogeneous and each individual, which is engaged in symmetric game, is identical to
strategy update. In fact, biological agents in many real populations are non-identical
to their abilities to competition, survival and reproduction. For instance, the diﬀerence
in sex, male or female, plays a signiﬁcant role in group dominance. The age, old or
young; the strength, strong or weak, etc, are also factors aﬀecting the individuals’
competition and cooperation. Thus, we here relax the simplifying assumptions and
consider that the populations are inhomogeneous. In our scenario, we aim to investigate
the inhomogeneity’s eﬀect in evolutionary game dynamics. The remainder of this paper
is organized as follows: A simple model is constructed to describe the inhomogeneity of
the populations and a stochastic process for evolutionary game theory is introduced in
section 2. And then analytical results and corresponding simulations of the model are
provided in section 3. Finally, conclusions are made in section 4.

2. The Model

v

In this model, the populations are well-mixed and each player interacts with each other
player. To describe the inhomogeneity of the populations, we just assume that two
types of players are distributed randomly in the populations (just like male and female
individuals in a population) [18, 19]. For simplicity, we use E to denote one type players
and F to denote the other type players. Every player has only one type and their
distribution is ﬁxed later on. The concentration of players E and F are denoted by
v(0
v. All individuals just follow A or B strategies no matter what
types they are. And when players E interact with other players, the payoﬀ of players
E will be strengthened no matter what strategies players E follow; while the payoﬀ of
players F will keep unchanged no matter what strategies players F follow when players
F interact with other players. Now, suppose the population consists of N players. The
number of players using strategy A is given by i, the number of players using strategy
B is given by N
i. If every player interacts with every other player, the average payoﬀ
of A and B are respectively given from a mean-ﬁeld theory

We now describe the selection mechanism process as follows: In each time step, an
individual is chosen with a probability proportional to its ﬁtness; a second individual
is selected randomly. Then the second individual switches to the ﬁrst one’s strategy.
Moreover, if the second individual is a player E, it will weaken the probability to switch
to the ﬁrst one’s strategy; otherwise, it will keep the probability to switch to the ﬁrst
one’s strategy. And we write the probability that the number of A individuals increases
from i to i + 1 as

where the parameter q2 characterizes the strength of reduced switching activity if the

their payoﬀ, they are not sensitive to switch their strategies, therefore, we set q2 < 1 .

The ﬁtness of A is greater than the ﬁtness of B in this example. Hence, we say
that A dominates B. Figure 1 shows the evolution from a state with 20% A into the end
state with all A. Since a = 0.3 > c = 0.1 and b = 0.5 > d = 0.2, ﬁgure 1 conﬁrms the
theoretical predictions.

In fact, the diﬀerences among the three dynamics equations amount to a dynamics
rescaling of time. And F (v) and G(v, x, w) in (9) are factors inﬂuencing the time scale
only. They would aﬀect only the speed of evolution, but would not inﬂuence the long-
run behavior. Then, we would like to show that how they aﬀect the time scale for
diﬀerent values of the parameters. In this model for the ﬁxed values of q1, q2 and w,
1−w
w is constant with weak selection, then only F (v) can inﬂuence the time

scale for the variable v. Here, F (v) has a maximum at v = vc for diﬀerent v

vc = 2−q1−q2

2(q1−1)(q2−1) = 0.5.
The four outcome predictions, which can respectively reﬂect the four relationships
between q1 and q2, are found from the replicator dynamics equation, thus they are
justiﬁed for inﬁnite or large ﬁnite populations. In other words, it can converge fastest
to the equilibrium state when v = vc for inﬁnite populations. However,
in ﬁnite
populations, if the mean time to ﬁxation becomes very large, the model may be limited
interest, therefore, discussion on the ﬁxation time Tv is an interesting topic. Here,
whether the ﬁxation time Tv in ﬁnite populations has a minimum at vc respectively
corresponding to the four situations in inﬁnite populations is a more interesting topic.
Indeed, the four outcome predictions for inﬁnite populations are still valid for small
ﬁnite populations. For ﬁnite populations, Tv means that the time from an initial state

In the following simulation results, the initial frequency of cooperators is 80%, and
we set b = 3, c = 2 and w = 0.0001. In ﬁgure 2, we show the ﬁxation probability of
a Prisoner’s Dilemma starting with 80% cooperators. Clearly, cooperators are always
dominated by defectors. It shows that stronger rates q1 decrease the ﬁxation probability
of cooperators and the ﬁxation probability of cooperators monotonically decreases when
the value of the parameter v increases with a given ﬁxed q1. These results can be
understood in the following way. When the values of q1 or v increase, it results in
that the temperature of selection is enhanced. For the Prisoner’s Dilemma, the average
payoﬀ of cooperators is less than the average payoﬀ of defectors. Therefore, the ﬁxation
probability of cooperators decreases for the Prisoner’s Dilemma when the temperature
of selection is increased [19]. Moreover, we have found that the ﬁxation probability has
nothing to do with the strength of switching activity q2 from (12). In ﬁgure 3, we show
the ﬁxation time of a Prisoner’s Dilemma starting with 80% cooperators for N = 1000.
The ﬁxation time from (11) for diﬀerent situations are computed, respectively.
In
ﬁgure 3(a), q1 + q2 = 1.8 < 2. In this case, Tv has its minimum at v = 0. And we
observe that vc = 0 from ﬁgure 3(a). In ﬁgure 3(b), 2 < q1 + q2 = 2.8 < 3.2 = 2q1q2. In
this case, Tv has its minimum at v = 1. And we observe that vc = 1 from ﬁgure 3(b).
In ﬁgure 3(c), 2q1q2 = 4.25 < q1 + q2 = 8.75, In this case, Tv has its minimum at
2×(8.5−10×(0.25−1) = 0.6. And we observe that vc = 0.6 from ﬁgure 3(c).

v = 0.5. And we observe that vc = 0.5 from ﬁgure 3(d). These results for ﬁnite
populations are totally in very good agreement with theoretical predictions for inﬁnite
populations and these ﬁgures conﬁrm that the ﬁxation time Tv also has its minimum at
vc. Moreover, these results for the ﬁxation time in ﬁnite populations are still valid even
if w does not satisfy the condition: w

4. Conclusions

To sum up, we have studied the evolutionary game dynamics in inhomogeneous
populations. We have provided a model by description of a microscopic process which
is similar to Moran Process. Comparing with standard replicator and Moran Process
dynamics, it also keeps the ﬁxed points unchanged. Nevertheless, this can aﬀect the
speed of converging to the equilibrium state. We have also calculated the ﬁxation
probability and the ﬁxation time, and found that there exists an optimum solution to
converge fastest to the stable equilibria. This result requires no limiting assumption on
population size. As is known, how to decrease the mean time to the ﬁxed state from
an initial state is an important quantity [23]. From this perspective, our results on
inhomogeneous populations may shed light on this issue.

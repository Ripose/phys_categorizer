Summary. We review a resent time-dependent performance measure for economical
time series — the (optimal) investment horizon approach. For stock indices, the
approach shows a pronounced gain-loss asymmetry that is not observed for the
individual stocks that comprise the index. This diﬀerence may hint towards an
synchronize of the draw downs of the stocks.

As an investor or practitioner working in the ﬁnancial industry, you are
continuously faced with the challenge of how to chose and manage a portefolio
under varying market conditions; as the market change, you have to decide
whether to adjust your positions in order to make the portfolio, as you see
it, more optimal. The way such important decisions are made, with dramatic
economic consequences if done badly, is rather complex; most market players
have their very own methods for this purpose, and they are only rarely dis-
closed to the public. The clients risk aversion, which is based on individual
psychology, plays a major role in the task of choosing a portfolio and hence
quantiﬁable and rational measure must be used in for example stress testing
of the portfolio.

As the ﬁnancial industry became fully computerized, the distribution of re-
turns approach became popular for measuring asset performance from historic
data records. Today, this method is considered one of the classic approaches
for gauging the performance of an asset [1, 2]. The method relies on the distri-
bution of returns (to be deﬁned below) corresponding to a ﬁxed time window
(or horizon as we will refer to it below). In order to look into the performance
over a diﬀerent time horizon, the return distribution has to be regenerated
for the new window size. Actually, one of the most successful strategies for
actively investing when the risk aversion is not low, is to, a priori, decide for a
return level and then liquidate the position when this level has been reached.
It is not at all clear that the natural scenario for an investor is to consider
ﬁxed time windows. There has therefore lately been a lot of interest in time
dependent measures, i.e. measures where the time period over which the asset
is hold, is non-constant, and allowed to depend on the speciﬁc market condi-

tions which in general is not known in detail. A change in time horizon used
by an investor may be due to for instance a changes in the market itself, or
new investment strategies being implemented by the investor.

In this work, we will review a recent development in such time-dependent
measures — the investment horizon approach. This approach is motivated by
progress in turbulence [3], and it represents an adaption of a more general
concept, known as inverse statistics, to economics. The investment horizon
approach was ﬁrst introduced into economics by the present authors [4], and
later considered in a series of publications [5, 6, 7, 8]. The method has re-
cently been applied to diﬀerent types of ﬁnancial data with success; stock
index data [4, 5, 6], like the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), NASDAQ,
Standard and Poor 500 (SP500), individual stocks [8], and high frequency
foreign exchange (FX) data [6]. A similar approach, however without a ﬁxed
return level, has been studied in Refs. [9, 10] with the prime focus on losses.
Let S(t) denote the asset price, and s(t) = ln S(t) the corresponding log-
arithmic price. Here time (t) can be measured in diﬀerent ways [2], but the
various choices may result in diﬀerent properties for the inverse statistics [6].
The logarithmic return at time t, calculated over a time interval ∆t, is deﬁned
as [1, 2] r∆t(t) = s(t + ∆t)

s(t).

We consider a situation where an investor is aiming for a given return level
denoted by ρ. This level may be both positive (gains) or negative (losses). If
the investment is made at time t, then the investment horizon is deﬁned as
the time τρ(t) = ∆t so that the inequality r∆t(t)
0
(ρ < 0) is satisﬁed for the ﬁrst time. In mathematical terms, this can be
expressed as

The investment horizon distribution, p (τρ), is then the distribution of invest-
ment horizons τρ estimated from the data (cf. Fig. 1a). This distribution will
go through a maximum, as should be apparent from the discussion to follow.
This maximum — the optimal investment horizon — will be denoted τ ∗
ρ . It
quantiﬁes the most likely time period (obtained from historic data) needed to
reach the investment outcome characterized by ρ.

For later use, we stress that if the price process S(t) is a geometrical
Brownian motion — the classic assumption made in theoretical ﬁnance — then
the solution to the investment horizon (ﬁrst passage time) problem is known
analytically [11]. It can be shown that the investment horizon distribution

This pre-processing of the data was done in order to enable a more consistent
comparison of the results corresponding to positive and negative levels of
returns due to diﬀerences in economic fundamentals such as inﬂation, interest
rates, etc. The data set used to produce the results of Fig. 1a was the daily
close of the Dow Jones Industrial Average taken over its whole history up
till present. From this same ﬁgure, two well-pronounced, but not coinciding,
optimal investment horizons can be observed from the empirical distributions

the values of τ ∗
ρ will depend on the return level ρ, and we presents results
for the DJIA in Fig. 2 for positive and negative return levels. Recall that if
the price process is consistent with a geometrical Brownian motion, one has
τ ∗
ργ with γ = 2 for all values of ρ (lower dashed line in Fig. 2). The
ρ ∼
empirical results are observed not to be consistent with such a behavior. For
rather small levels of returns — a fraction of a percent — the dependence
on return level is quite weak. When
is increased, however, the dependence
ρ

|
becomes more pronounced and it gradually becomes more and more like,
but still diﬀerent from, the geometrical Brownian result. As a whole, the
dependence of τ ∗
ρ (on ρ) over the range of return levels considered in Fig. 2,
resembles more a double logarithmic behavior than a power law. However,
for the range of ρ-values considered and the fact that the statistics become
poorer for increasing levels of return, we are unable from the empirical data
alone to uncover the actual functional dependence of τ ∗
ρ on the return level.
One of the most striking features of Fig. 2 is the apparent fact that the
optimal investment horizon for positive and negative return levels are not the
same. This asymmetry starts to develop when the return level
is not too
small (cf. Fig. 2). Such a gain-loss asymmetry is actually a rather general
feature of the investment horizon of stock indices [6]. On the other hand, for
individual stocks that together comprise the index, this phenomenon is less
pronounced [8] and an asymmetry can often hardly be seen at all. In Fig. 1b
this is exempliﬁed by the investment horizons of IBM for ρ =
0.05, a com-
pany that is part of the DJIA index. Similar results hold for most other stocks

being part of the DJIA [8]. The attentive reader could ask: How is it possible
that an asymmetry is present in the index, but not in the individual stocks
that together make out the index? At the time of writing, there is no consen-
sus on what is causing this behavior. It has been speculated that it might be
caused by cooperative eﬀects taking place among the stocks and causing them
to partly synchronize their draw-downs (conditional serial correlation). If that
was to be the case, the index — that is some average of the individual stocks —
will experience an increased probability of shorter investments horizons τ−|ρ|
compared to the similar results found for the same positive level of return.
Other speculations go in the direction of this phenomenon being related to the
so-called leverage eﬀect [12]. These questions are being addressed by ongoing
research eﬀorts, and it is hoped that they will be satisfactory answered in the
immediate future.

Before ending this contribution, we would like to add a few comments
regarding possible practical implications (as we see it) of the investment hori-
zon approach [13]. Two applications will be mentioned here, both taken from
portfolio management. The ﬁrst application is related to the problem of consis-
tent allocation of VAR-like (quantile) and stop-loss limits. For such problems,
the correlation structure over diﬀerent time horizons is important. Our ap-
proach naturally use non-ﬁxed time windows, and it is therefore hoped that it
might contribute some new insight onto these issues. The second application
is concerned with the calculation of risk measures for portfolios. When the
market is moving against you, you are forced to liquidate. In this process,
“liquidation horizons” that are used across assets of a portfolio, are normally
not the same. By taking advantage of the negative return levels, investment
horizon distributions p
for the diﬀerent assets of the portfolio, may be
used to design an optimal liquidation procedure depending on the nature of
the position, e.g., long or short. The exploration of possible applications of
the concept of inverse statistics in economics is at its infancy. We hope that
the future will demonstrate this approach to be fruitful also from a practical
standpoint.

A new measure of asset performance that represents an alternative to the
classic distribution of returns approach has been described. Unlike the classic
method, the new technique is time-dependent. This opens the possibility of
studying and measure asset performance over a non-constant time scale, an
idea that lately has attracted a great deal of attention.

We study a general set of models of social network evolution and dynamics. The models consist of both a
dynamics on the network and evolution of the network. Links are formed preferentially between ’similar’ nodes,
where the similarity is deﬁned by the particular process taking place on the network. The interplay between the
two processes produces phase transitions and hysteresis, as seen using numerical simulations for three speciﬁc
processes. We obtain analytic results using mean ﬁeld approximations, and for a particular case we derive an
exact solution for the network. In common with real-world social networks, we ﬁnd coexistence of high and
low connectivity phases and history dependence.

INTRODUCTION

In recent years physicists have paid much attention to net-
work structures – describing either technological infrastruc-
tures or biological, genetic, logical or social relationships – as
they play a prominent role in shaping the nature of the pro-
cesses taking place on them and the resulting collective be-
havior. Examples of how the structure affects the function of
networked systems include the importance of shortcuts in en-
dowing ﬁnite dimensional networks of the small world prop-
erty [1] and of scale-free degree distribution for robustness
against failure [2] or the relevance of motifs for speciﬁc dy-
namical properties [3].

Socio-economic networks offer an example where the rela-
tion between structure and function is not unidirectional. In-
deed their structure is inherently dynamical and it is shaped
by the incentives of agents, i.e. by the socio-economic func-
tions provided by the network. This paper discusses a class of
generic model of stochastic dynamical social networks which
make the interplay between structure and function of social
network explicit in a simple way. We consider a set of agents
– be they individuals or organisations – who establish bilat-
eral interactions (links) when proﬁtable. The network evolves
under changing conditions. That is, the favourable circum-
stances that led at some point to the formation of a particu-
lar link may later on deteriorate, causing that link’s removal.
Hence volatility (exogenous or endogenous) is a key disrup-
tive element in the dynamics. Concurrently, new opportunities
arise that favour the formation of new links. Whether linking
occurs depends on factors related to the similarity or prox-
imity of the two parties. For example, in cases where trust
is essential in the establishment of new relationships (e.g. in
crime or trade networks), linking may be facilitated by com-
mon acquaintances or by the existence of a chain of acquain-
in R&D
tances joining the two parties. In other cases (e.g.

or scientiﬁc networks), a common language, methodology, or
comparable level of technical competence may be required for
the link to be feasible or fruitful to both parties.

In a nutshell, our model conceives the dynamics of the net-
work as a struggle between volatility (that causes link decay)
on the one hand, and the creation of new links (that is depen-
dent on similarity) on the other. The model must also specify
the dynamics governing inter-node similarity. A reasonable
assumption in this respect is that such similarity is enhanced
by close interaction, as reﬂected by the social network. For
example, a ﬁrm (or researcher) beneﬁts from collaborating
with a similarly advanced partner, or individuals who inter-
act regularly tend to converge on their social norms and other
standards of behavior.

We study different speciﬁcations of the general framework,
each one embodying alternative forms of the intuitive idea that
“interaction promotes similarity.” Our main ﬁnding is that in
all of these different cases the network dynamics exhibits a
rich phenomenology characterized by a) sharp phase transi-
tion b) resilience, i.e. stability against deteriorating condi-
tions and c) equilibrium coexistence. The essential mecha-
nism at work is a positive feedback between link creation and
inter-node similarity, these two factors each exerting a positive
effect on the other. Feedback forces of this kind appear to op-
erate in the dynamics of many social networks. We show that
they are sufﬁcient to produce the sharp transitions, resilience,
and equilibrium co-existence that, as we will discuss in the
next section, are salient features of many socio-economic phe-
nomena. Finally, this phenomenology bears a formal similar-
ity with the liquid-gas phase transition, thus suggesting that
a classiﬁcation in terms of phases may be applicable also to
socio-economic networks.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: The next sec-
tion discusses in an introductory way the empirical evidence
which our model addresses. In section III we outline the gen-
eral setup and a generic model of which we will discuss par-
ticular realizations the following sections. In particular, we
shall ﬁrst discuss the case where network formation depends
on the topology of the network (sect. IV) and then cases where
it is coupled with the dynamics of a continuous (sect. V) or
discrete (sect. VI) variable. These two models addresses sit-

uations where homogeneity in some dimension (e.g. techno-
logical levels or knowledge) or coordination (on e.g. a stan-
dard) play a crucial role, respectively. Numerical simulations
will be supplemented by mean ﬁeld analysis which provides
a correct qualitative picture in all cases and, in some cases,
accurate quantitative estimates. A case where an exact solu-
tion can be derived will be described in section VII. In section
VIII we end with some concluding remarks.

II. EMPIRICAL STYLIZED FACTS OF
SOCIO-ECONOMIC NETWORKS

There is a growing consensus among social scientists that
many social phenomena display an inherent network dimen-
sion. Not only are they “embedded” in the underlying so-
cial network [4] but, reciprocally, the social network itself is
largely shaped by the evolution of those phenomena. The
range of social problems subject to these considerations is
wide and important. It includes, for example, the spread of
crime [5, 6] and other social problems (e.g.
teenage preg-
nancy [7, 8]), the rise of industrial districts [9, 10, 11], and
the establishment of research collaborations, both scientiﬁc
[12, 13] and industrial [14, 15]. Throughout these cases, there
are a number of interesting observations worth highlighting:

(a) Sharp transitions: The shift from a sparse to a highly
connected network often unfolds rather “abruptly,” i.e. in a
short timespan. For example, concerning the escalation of so-
cial pathologies in some neighborhoods of large cities, Crane
[7] writes that “...if the incidence [of the problem] reaches a
critical point, the process of spread will explode.” Also, con-
sidering the growth of research collaboration networks, Goyal
et al. [13] report a steep increase in the per capita number of
collaborations among academic economists in the last three
decades, while Hagerdoorn [14] reports an even sharper (ten-
fold) increase for R&D partnerships among ﬁrms during the
decade 1975-1985.

(b) Resilience: Once the transition to a highly connected
network has taken place, the network is robust, surviving
even a reversion to “unfavorable” conditions. The case of
California’s Silicon Valley, discussed in a classic account by
Saxenian [10], illustrates this point well.
Its thriving per-
formance, even in the face of the general crisis undergone
by the computer industry in the 80’s, has been largely at-
tributed to the dense and ﬂexible networks of collaboration
across individual actors that characterized it. Another intrinsi-
cally network-based example is the rapid recent development
of Open-Source software (e.g. Linux), a phenomenon sus-
tained against large odds by a dense web of collaboration and
trust [16]. Finally, as an example where “robustness” has neg-
ative rather than positive implications, Crane [7] describes the
difﬁculty, even with vigorous social measures, of improving
a local neighborhood once crime and other social pathologies
have taken hold.

(c) Equilibrium co-existence: Under apparently simi-
lar environmental conditions, social networks may be found
both in a dense or sparse state. Again, a good illustration

2

is provided by the dual experience of poor neighborhoods
in large cities [7], where neither poverty nor other socio-
economic conditions (e.g. ethnic composition) can alone ex-
plain whether or not there is degradation into a ghetto with
rampant social problems. Returning to R&D partnerships,
empirical evidence [14] shows a very polarized situation,
almost all R&D partnerships taking place in a few (high-
technology) industries. Even within those industries, partner-
ships are almost exclusively between a small subset of ﬁrms
in (highly advanced) countries [17].

From a theoretical viewpoint, the above discussion raises
the question of whether there is some common mechanism at
work in the dynamics of social networks that, in a wide variety
of different scenarios, produces the three features explained
above: (a) discontinuous phase transitions, (b) resilience, and
(c) equilibrium coexistence. Our aim in this paper is to shed
light on this question within a general framework that is ﬂexi-
ble enough to accommodate, under alternative concrete spec-
iﬁcations, a rich range of social-network dynamics.

III. THE MODEL

Consider a set N = {1, . . . , n} of agents, whose state
and interactions evolve in continuous time t. They form the
nodes of a network which is described by a non-directed graph
g(t) ⊂ {ij : i ∈ N , j ∈ N }, where ij(≡ ji) ∈ g(t) iff a
link exists between agents i and j. The network evolution is
modelled in terms of continuous time stochastic elementary
Poisson processes, and it is therefore deﬁned by specifying
the rates at which these processes occur [18]. Firstly, each
node i receives an opportunity to form a link with a node j,
randomly drawn from N (i 6= j), at rate η. If the link ij is not
already in place, it forms with probability

P {ij → g(t)} =

1 if dij (t) ≤ ¯d
if dij (t) > ¯d
ǫ

(cid:26)

(1)

where dij (t) is the “distance” (to be speciﬁed later) between i
and j prevailing at t. Thus if i and j are close, in the sense that
their distance is no higher than some given threshold ¯d, the
link forms at rate η; otherwise, it forms at a much smaller rate
ηǫ. Secondly, each existing link ij ∈ g(t) decays at rate λ.
That is, each link in the network disappears with probability
λdt in a time interval [t, t + dt). We shall discuss three differ-
ent speciﬁcations of the distance dij, each capturing different
aspects that may be relevant for socio-economic interactions.
In all three cases, we mostly focus on the stationary state
behavior, which we shall illustrate using both numerical sim-
ulations and a mean-ﬁeld analytic approach. Concerning the
latter, we focus on the limit n → ∞, for which the analy-
sis is simpler. We characterise the long run behavior of the
network solely in terms of the stationary degree distribution
p(k), which is the fraction of agents with k neighbours. This
corresponds to neglecting degree correlations, i.e. to approx-
imating the network with a random graph (see [19]), an ap-
proximation which is reasonably accurate in the cases we dis-
cuss here. The degree distribution satisﬁes a master equation,

which is speciﬁed in terms of the transition rates w(k → k±1)
for the addition or removal of a link, for an agent linked with
k neighbours. While w(k → k − 1) = λk always takes the
same form, the transition rate for the addition of a new link

w(k → k + 1) = 2η

ǫ + (1 − ǫ)P {di,j ≤ ¯d}

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

depends on the particular speciﬁcation of the distance dij .
Matching the link creation and removal processes, yields an
equation for the degree distribution p(k). The probability
P {di,j ≤ ¯d}, in its turn, will itself depend on the network
density, i.e. on p(k). Our approach will then have the ﬂavor
of a self-consistent mean ﬁeld approximation.

IV. SIMILARITY BY (CHAINS OF) ACQUAINTANCES

Consider ﬁrst

the simplest possible such speciﬁcation
where dij (t) is the (geodesic) distance between i and j on
the graph g(t), neighbours j of i having dij (t) = 1, neigh-
bours of the neighbours of i (which are not neighbours of i)
having dij (t) = 2, and so on. If no path joins i and j we set
dij (t) = ∞.

This speciﬁc model describes a situation where the forma-
tion of new links is strongly inﬂuenced by proximity on the
graph. It is a simple manifestation of our general idea that
close interaction brings about similarity – here the two met-
rics coincide. We set ¯d ≥ n − 1, the link formation process
then discriminates between agents belonging to the same net-
work component (which are joined by at least one path of links
in g) and agents in different components. Distinct compo-
nents of the graph may, for example, represent different social
groups. Then Eq. (1) captures the fact that belonging to the
same social group is important in the creation of new links
(say, because it facilitates control or reciprocity [20, 21]).

Consider ﬁrst what happens when η/λ is small. Let hki be
the average connectivity (number of links per node) in the net-
work. The average rate nλ hki /2 of link removal is very high
when hki is signiﬁcant. Consequently, we expect to have a
very low hki, which in turn implies that the population should
be fragmented into many small groups. Under these circum-
stances, the likelihood that an agent i “meets” an agent j in
the same component is negligible for large populations, and
therefore new links are created at a rate equal to nηǫ. By bal-
ancing link creation and link destruction, the average number
of neighbours of an agent is hki = 2ηǫ/λ, as is indeed found
in our simulations (Fig 1).

As η/λ increases, the network density hki increases gradu-
ally. Then, at a critical value (η/λ)1 = 1/2ǫ – when hki = 1 –
a giant component forms. The system makes a discontinuous
jump (Fig. 1) to a state containing a large and densely inter-
connected community covering a ﬁnite fraction of the popula-
tion. If η/λ decreases back again beyond the transition point
(η/λ)1, the dense network remains stable. The dense network
dissolves back into a sparsely connected one only at a sec-
ond point (η/λ)2. This phenomenology characterises a wide
region of parameter space (see inset of Fig. 1) and is qualita-
tively well reproduced by a simple mean ﬁeld approach.

FIG. 1: Mean degree hki as a function of λ (η has been set to 1) for
ǫ = 0.2 when dij is the distance on the graph and ¯d ≥ n − 1. The
results of a mean ﬁeld theory for n = ∞ (solid line) are compared to
numerical simulations (×) starting from both low and high connected
states with n = 20000. The dashed line corresponds to an unstable
solution of the mean ﬁeld equations which separates the basins of
stability of the two solutions. For ﬁnite n the low density state “ﬂips”
to the high density state when a random ﬂuctuation in hki brings
the system across the stability boundary (i.e. when a sizable giant
component forms). These ﬂuctuations become more and more rare as
n increases. Inset : Phase diagram in mean ﬁeld theory. Coexistence
occurs in the shaded region whereas below (above) only the dense
(sparse) network phase is stable. Numerical simulations (symbols)
agree qualitatively with the mean ﬁeld prediction. The high (low)
density state is stable up (down) to the points marked with × (⋄) and
is unstable at points marked with ◦ (+). The behavior of hki along
the dashed line is reported in the main ﬁgure.

It is worth mentioning that a similar phenomenology occurs
when ¯d = 2, i.e. when links are preferentially formed with
“friends of friends ”[22]. In this case, however, the probability
that two arbitrary nodes i and j have dij = 2 is of order 1/n
in a network with ﬁnite degree. Hence for ﬁnite ǫ and λ non-
linear effect manifest only for networks of ﬁnite sizes [22].

We ﬁnally mention that the model with ¯d = 2 is reminis-
cent of a model that was recently proposed [23] to describe
a situation where (as e.g. in job search [24]) agents ﬁnd new
linking opportunities through current partners. In [23] agents
use their links to search for new connections, whereas here ex-
isting links favour new link formation. In spite of this concep-
tual difference, the model in Ref. [23] also features the phe-
nomenology (a)-(c) above, i.e. sharp transitions, resilience,
and phase coexistence.

A. Mean Field Analysis

The transition rate for the addition of a new link is w(k →
k + 1) = 2ηǫ if the two agents are in different components
and w(k → k + 1) = 2η if they are in the same component,
where the factor 2 comes because each node can either initiate
or receive a new link. In the large n limit the latter case only

w(k → k + 1) = 2η[ǫ + (1 − ǫ)γ(1 − uk)].

(5)

A. Best-Practise imitation

occurs with some probability if the graph has a giant compo-
nent G which contains a ﬁnite fraction γ of nodes. For random
graphs (see Ref. [19] for details) the fraction of nodes in G is
given by

where

γ = 1 − φ(u)

is the generating function and u is the probability that a link,
followed in one direction, does not lead to the giant compo-
nent. The latter satisﬁes the equation

Hence uk is the probability an agent with k neighbours has
no links connecting him to the giant component, and hence
is itself not part of the giant component. Then the rate of
addition of links takes the form

The stationary state condition of the master equation leads to
the following equation for φ(s)

λφ′(s) = 2η[ǫ + (1 − ǫ)γ]φ(s) − 2η(1 − ǫ)γφ(us)

(6)

which can be solved numerically to the desired accuracy. No-
tice that Eq. (6) is a self-consistent problem, because the pa-
rameters γ and u depend on the solution φ(s). The solution
of this equation is summarised in Fig. 1. Either one or three
solutions are found, depending on the parameters. In the latter
case, the intermediate solution is unstable (dashed line in Fig.
1), and it separates the basins of attraction of the two stable
solutions within the present mean ﬁeld theory.

The solution is exact where there is no giant component,
and numerical simulations show that the mean ﬁeld approach
is very accurate away from the phase transition from the con-
nected to the disconnected state. Near the transition to the
disconnected state our approximation, that an agent’s degree
fully speciﬁes its state, breaks down. This causes the theory
to overestimate the size of the coexistence region.

V. SIMILARITY OF KNOWLEDGE/TECHNOLOGY
LEVELS

Next, we consider a setup where dij reﬂects proximity of
nodes i, j in terms of some continuous (non-negative) real
attributes, hi(t), hj(t). This case has been dealt with in Ref.
[25], which provides a detailed socio-economic motivation for
the model. In short, the attribute hi could represent the level of
technical expertise of two ﬁrms involved in an R&D partner-
ship, or the competence of two researchers involved in a joint
project. It could also be a measure of income or wealth that
bears on the quality and prospects of a bilateral relationship.
We assume that each agent i receives an attribute update (or

4

upgrade) possibility at a rate ν. We focus on the case where
the dynamics of hi is much faster than that of the network
(ν ≫ λ, η). In the opposite limit, links exits for too short a
time span to have any correlated effect on the dynamics of hi.
If agent i receives an update opportunity at time t, we posit
that

hi(t+) = D{hj, j ∈ Ni(t)} + ηi(t)

(7)

where ηi(t) is a random term capturing the idiosyncratic
change of expertise due to i’s own (say research) efforts. In
Eq.
(7) the function D{·} captures some process of diffu-
sion (e.g. sharing of knowledge) in the current neighborhood
Ni(t) = {j : ij ∈ g(t)} of agent i.

We will take ηi(t) to be Gaussian i.i.d. random variables
with zero mean and variance ∆. This random idiosyncratic
term competes with the homogenising force of diffusion de-
scribed by the ﬁrst term in Eq. (7). Concerning this term, we
will consider two alternative models.

(2)

(3)

(4)

The ﬁrst one, which we will label Best-Practise Imitation
(BPI) has the revising player achieve a knowledge level equal
to the maximum available in her neighbourhood. We have in
mind a situation where individuals aim at improving in the
direction of increasing hi and they may do this by some on-
site effort and also by learning from other individuals.

Formally, this is captured by the following deﬁnition:

D{hj, j ∈ Ni(t) ∪ {i}} = max
j∈Ni(t)

hj(t).

(8)

Notice that if i has no neighbor (Ni(t) = ∅) then D = hi.
This is equivalent to a directed polymer at zero temperature
on the (dynamic) network g(t) [26]. A related model, using
the idea of best practice imitation but with different noise has
been studied in [28], but for randomly chosen neighbours at
each interaction (i.e. no network).

Fig. 2 reports typical results of simulations of this model.
As in the two previous models, we ﬁnd a discontinuous transi-
tion between a sparse and a dense network state, characterised
by hysteresis effects. When the network is sparse, diffusion is
ineffective in homogenising growth. Hence the distance dij
is typically beyond the threshold ¯d, thus the link formation
process is slow. On the other hand, with a dense network,
diffusion keeps the gaps between the his of different nodes
small, which in turn has a positive effect on network forma-
tion. As before, the phase transition and hysteresis is a result
of the positive feedback that exists between the dynamics of
the hi and the adjustment of the network. In the stationary
state we ﬁnd that h(t) ≡ hhi(t)i grows linearly in time, i.e.
hi(t) ≃ vt. Notably, the growth process is much faster (i.e. v
is much higher) in the dense network equilibrium than in the
sparse one, as shown in the lower panel of Fig. 2.

This model exhibits an interplay between the process on the
network - the hi(t) which depends on the network - and the

network evolution which depends on the hi(t). It is this inter-
dependence and the corresponding positive feedback which
produces the discontinuous transition and phase coexistence.
The similarity of the behavior of this model with that of the
previous section can be understood by analyzing a particular
limit. Consider indeed the case where ηi = 1 with probability
a and ηi = 0 otherwise. When νa ≪ η innovations take place
at a rate much smaller that that over which new links form. In
the limit where the dynamics of hi is fast enough (ν ≫ η), we
can assume that each new innovation (i.e. each event ηi = 1)
taking place on a connected component instantaneously prop-
agates to the entire set of connected nodes. Hence, if ¯d < 1,
link creation will occur with probability one on nodes in the
same connected component, whereas nodes in different com-
ponents will likely have distinct values of hi, so that links will
form at rate ηǫ. Note also that, in this particular limit, the
growth rate v is proportional to the size of the largest con-
nected component.

technological nature) and agents will naturally tend to adjust
towards their neighbours’ levels. In these cases, interaction
promotes conformity and conformism constraints the creation
of new links. At any rate, this speciﬁcation of the model al-
lows us to understand how the results of the previous section
depend on the directionality of the diffusion process.

Fig. 3 shows that this model exhibits the same generic phe-
nomenology of a sharp transition and the coexistence of sparse
and dense network phases. The key consideration, in this case,
is that when the link density is high, the distribution of hi in
the population is narrow and hence link creation proceeds at a
relatively fast rate.

This intuition is captured by a simple mean ﬁeld approach.
We will assume that the network can be well approximated by
an Erdos-Renyi random graph with average degree hki. When
ν ≫ η, λ, we can assume that the distribution of hi adjusts
adiabatically to the changing network. In this limit the dy-
namics is well described by the Edwards-Wilkinson Langevin
equation [30].

This second formulation can be conceived as reﬂecting a pro-

in the levels displayed by different individuals) [27, 29]. Al-
ternatively, it could be viewed as reﬂecting a context where
interaction payoffs are enhanced by compatibility (say, of a

This can be seen by considering a small time interval dt. If
νdt ≫ 1, the number of updates on each site is large and can
be approximated with the central limit theorem with the two
terms in Eq. (10). In this equation, ζi(t) is a white noise term
with zero average and hζi(t)ζj (t′)i = ν2∆δi,jδ(t − t′) and
we have introduced the (normalized) Laplacian matrix of the
graph L. The dynamics of this model is easily integrated in
the normal modes of the diffusion operator. In other words, let

form for ρ(µ), so one has to resort to numerical calculation.
To our level of approximation, it is sufﬁcient to stick to a sim-
ple approximation [31], where

ρ(µ) = −

and T (µ) is the solution of

T (µ) =

(14)

with ǫ → 0+. The key features are that:

• the integral

R(hki) =

Z

for Erdos-Renyi graphs, is a function of the average de-
gree hki alone.

• The function R(c) decreases monotonically and it di-
verges as c → 1+, when the giant component vanishes

This allows us to estimate the probability

P {|hi − hj| < ¯d} = θ(hki − 1)erf

(15)

where the θ function implies that this probability vanishes for
disconnected graphs. Equating the link formation and removal
rate, ﬁnally provides an equation for hki which reads

Fig. 3 reports the numerical solution of this equation for the
same parameters as in the simulations. This agreement is rea-
sonably good in view of the approximations made. Again the
mean ﬁeld approach overestimates the size of the coexistence

region. The mean-ﬁeld calculation reproduces the main qual-
itative behavior, even though it (again) overestimates the size
of the coexistence region.

The emergence of features (a)-(c) depends crucially on the
divergence of R(hki) on the average degree when hki ≈
1. This divergence gets smoothed when ν decreases, which
suggests that the discontinuous transition should turn into a
smooth crossover beyond a critical value νc. This scenario,
which is reminiscent of the behavior at the liquid-gas phase
transition, is indeed conﬁrmed by numerical simulations.

VI. COORDINATING IN A CHANGING WORLD

We now consider a further specialisation of the general
framework where link formation requires some form of co-
ordination, synchronisation, or compatibility. For example, a
proﬁtable interaction may fail to occur if the two parties do
not agree on where and when to meet, or if they do not speak
the same languages, and/or adopt compatible technologies and
standards. In addition, it may well be that shared social norms
and codes enhance trust and thus are largely needed for fruit-
ful interaction.

To account for these considerations, we endow each agent
with an attribute xi which may take one of q different values,
xi ∈ {1, 2, . . . , q}. xi describes the internal state of the agent,
specifying e.g. its technological standard, language, or the so-
cial norms she adopts. The formation of a new link ij requires
that i and j display the same attribute, i.e. xi = xj . This is a
particularisation of the general Eq. (1) with dij = 1 − δxi,xj
and 0 < ¯d < 1. For simplicity we set ǫ = 0 since in the
present formulation there is always a ﬁnite probability that
two nodes display the same attribute and hence can link. We
assume each agent revises its attribute at rate ν, choosing xi
dependent on its neighbours’ xj s according to:

1
Z

P {xi(t) = x} =

exp 

β

δx,xj(t)

(17)


where β tunes the tendency of agents to conform with their
neighbours and Z provides the normalisation. This adjust-
ment rule coincides with the Kawasaki dynamics, which is
known to sample the equilibrium distribution of the Potts
model of statistical physics [32] with temperature T =
(17) has been used extensively, mainly for
1/(kBβ). Eq.
q = 2, in the socio-economic literature as a discrete choice
model [33, 34, 35].

This model describes a situation where agents are engaged
in bilateral interactions which however require a degree of co-
ordination among partners (i.e. xi = xj ). The agents attempt
to improve their situation both by coordinating their value of
xi with that of neighbours and by searching for neighbours in
their same state and linking with them. Link removal mod-
els decay of links, e.g. due to obsolescence considerations.
The stochastic nature of the choice rule (17) captures a de-
gree of volatility or un-modelled features on which the inter-
action depends (e.g. one might think that agent i might have

some advantage for choosing a given value of xi at a particular
time). From the point of view of statistical physics, the pres-
ence of a non-zero “temperature” prevents the system from
getting stuck in imperfect states. We will consider these ef-
fects in more detail below (see section VII and Fig. 8) when
discussing the case β → ∞ in greater detail.

This is another manifestation of our general idea that
network-mediated contact favors inter-node similarity. As in
Section V, we focus on the case where such a similarity-
enhancing dynamics proceeds at a much faster rate than the
network dynamics. That is, ν ≫ η, λ so that, at any given t
where the network g(t) is about to change, the attribute dy-
namics on the xi have relaxed to a stationary state. The statis-
tics of this state are those of the Potts model on the graph g(t).
For random graphs of speciﬁed degree distribution p(k), the
necessary statistics of the Potts model can be found [36, 37]
and this makes an analytic approach to this model possible.
We shall ﬁrst discuss an approximate theory to the general
case and then focus on a particular limit where the model can
be solved exactly.

A. Method of Solution

Again we rely on the random graph approximation where
the network is completely speciﬁed by the degree distribution
p(k). Now however the probability of two nodes being in the
same state if they are both in the giant component depends on
the magnetisation of the giant component. The master equa-
tion for a general node of degree k is,

where π(k) is the probability that a node of degree k is in the
same state as a randomly chosen node. This crucially depends
on whether the Potts spins are ordered or not. Indeed, for suf-
ﬁciently high β the equivalence between the different q spin
states is broken in the stationary state of the Potts model with
temperature 1/(kBβ). This is signalled by a non-zero value
of the magnetization

m =

qhδx,1i − 1
q − 1

(19)

where the average is both on the nodes of the giant component
and on the stationary distribution. Without loss of generality,
we can assume that x = 1 is the state which is selected and
m > 0 implies hδx,1i > 1/q. Then it is easy to see that

π(k) =

+

1
q

q − 1
q

γ(1 − uk)m(k)m

(20)

where γ, u are deﬁned in Eqs. (2,4) and m(k) = (qhδx,1|ki −
1)/(q − 1). Note that π(k) and m(k) depend on k,
more highly connected nodes being on average more coor-
dinated/magnetised (see ﬁgure 4).

With these equations we can ﬁnd p(k) and π(k) iteratively.
Starting from a given p(k), we ﬁrst compute the properties of

˙p(k) = λ(k + 1)p(k + 1) + 2ηp(k − 1)π(k − 1)

the Potts model on a random network with such a degree dis-
tribution, from which we get π(k) in Eq. (20). This with Eq.
(18) in the stationary state ( ˙p(k) = 0) allows us to estimate
xk = p(k)/p(0) from the equation

xk+1 =

[2ηπ(k) + λk]xk − 2ηπ(k −1)xk−1

lent despite the approximation made. As before, for high η/λ

pairs, one on each side of the phase line. The curves are theory, the
leftmost curve is ηc = (q/2)(exp(1/T ) + q − 1)/(exp(1/T ) − 1)
which is the expected transition line if the system gets stuck in the
metastable, unmagnetised state. The right curve is found using the
normal method described above.
Upper left: higher connectivity, coordinated region.
Lower right: lower connectivity, uncoordinated region.
The central region is the hysteretic region.

for low η/λ the network is sparsely connected. For interme-
diate values of η/λ the two states coexist and which one is
found depends on the initial conditions for p(k).

Figure 6 shows a phase diagram (simulations and theory)
for β and η/λ. It can be seen that the theory is rather close
to the simulation results. The low uncoordinated region is a
Poisson random graph with hki = 2η/(λq). Starting in this
state, the transition to the highly connected, magnetised state,
can only occur when there is a giant component, i.e. hki > 1
so η > λq/2. Hence the lowest point of the high connec-
tivity region of ﬁgure 6 is at η = 5 and T = 0. Although
ν ≫ η, λ, the simulations of the Potts model can still get into a
metastable unmagnetised state, even below the transition tem-
perature [37]. The temperature T at which this metastable
state becomes unstable is given by [37]

tween nodes that have the same spin, σi = sigmaj. The key
intuition is that the spin of site i can change only if ki = 0, i.e.
if the site is isolated. Hence we can classify sites in disjoint
subsets N = N0

q
σ=1 Nσ where

S
N0 = {i : ki = 0}
Nσ = {i : ki > 0, σi = σ}

σ = 1, . . . , q

(23)

The spins σi are frozen for all nodes i ∈ Nσ with σ > 0
whereas nodes in N0 have spin which are randomly updated at
a fast rate. Because ǫ = 0, links can only be formed between
nodes i and j which are either both in the same component
Nσ with σ > 0, or both in N0 provided they have the same
spin, or if one is in Nσ and one is in N0, but has spin σj = σ.
No link can be formed between i ∈ Nσ and j ∈ Nσ′ with
σ, σ′ > 0.

When a link with a node in N0 is formed, one or two nodes
pass from N0 to some Nσ. Likewise nodes of Nσ which lose
their links move to N0. Such a dynamics, in the limit n → ∞
is captured by the following evolution for the fraction nσ of
nodes in set Nσ (σ ≥ 0)

is ﬁxed by the normalization. The ﬁrst term in Eq. (24) arises
from the process where a node of degree zero joins a node of
type σ. The factor 2 is present because either node might have
initiated the link. The second term is the process where a node
of degree zero joins another node of degree zero. The factor
2 is present because nσ increases by 2. The dynamics of the
degree inside a component is just that leading to a random
Poissonian graph for ki > 0. Hence pσ,k is given by

VII. EXACT SOLUTION FOR T = 0.

From this it is clear that in the stationary states cσ obeys:

The model with β → ∞ and ǫ = 0 can be described ex-
actly. We assume that in the initial state, links exist only be-

.

In order to build a solution, let us notice that Eq. (29) has
two solutions (provided that 2ηn0 ≤ λqe−1) which we denote
c+ > 1 and c− < 1. Hence solutions can be speciﬁed in terms
of the number ℓ of components with cσ = c+. Then Eq. (30)
becomes

ℓc+ + (q − ℓ)c− =

2η

Equations (29, 31) can be solved for any value of η/λ and ℓ.
The degree distribution for the whole network is given by:

The average degree can be written as

hki =

ℓc+ + (q − ℓ)c−

We will now show that only the solutions with ℓ = 0 and 1
are dynamically stable. These are those which describe the
behavior of the model.

A. Stability Analysis

The dynamics can be written as ˙nσ = f (n0, nσ). Let
nσ = ¯nσ + ǫσ where ¯nσ is the solution derived above (i.e.
f (¯nσ, ¯n0) = 0) with cσ = c+ for σ ≤ ℓ and cσ = c− for
σ > ℓ. Here ǫσ is a small perturbation which, to leading or-
der, satisﬁes

˙ǫσ = λ

A solution is stable if all eigenvalues of T are negative. For
the ℓ = 0 solution, cσ = c− = 2η/(λq) for all σ, we ﬁnd
σ ǫσ = 0) with eigenvalue
q − 1 “transverse” eigenmodes (
µ = −(1 − c−)/(ec− − 1) and one “longitudinal” mode (ǫσ =
ǫ) with µ = −c−/(1 − e−c−). Both are stable (µ < 0) so the
ℓ = 0 solution is always stable, as long as c− < 1, i.e. for
2η < λq (see Eq. 31).

P

It is also easy to ﬁnd an unstable mode for solutions with
ℓ ≥ 2 components in the c+ state. Let cσ = c+ for σ ≤ ℓ and
cσ = c− otherwise and consider “transverse” perturbations
with ǫσ = 0 for σ > ℓ and
σ ǫσ = 0. These describe den-
sity ﬂuctuations among c+ components. We ﬁnd ˙ǫσ = λµǫ
P
with µ = c+(c+ −1)/(ec+ −1) > 0. This means that any per-
turbation of ℓ > 1 solutions with an imbalance between two
or more components with cσ = c+ will grow exponentially,
thus leading to the collapse of all but one of the components.

Lines are theory, crosses are simulations, n = 10000, run to t = 100
for equilibration, then to t = 200 for data taking. For n=10000
the q=10 low state is unstable below the predicted value of 5 due
to ﬂuctuations being signiﬁcant for ﬁnite n. The crosses that do not
lie on the theory curves are systems which ’jumped’ during the data
taking.

B. The ℓ = 1 solution

Combining equations (29, 31), the equation for c− with ℓ =

1 can be written as

c− −

2η/λ − qc−
e2η/λ−qc− − 1

= 0.

(36)

This equation has no solution for η < ηc, where ηc is the
point where the maximum of the l.h.s. of Eq. (36) as a func-
tion of c−, becomes zero. Beyond this point (η > ηc) two
solutions appear. The one with larger value of c− merges with
the ℓ = 0 solution, as c− → 1 when η → λq/2. This solution
is un-physical as it describes a network where c+, and hence
the average degree, decreases with the networking effort η (or
with decreasing volatility λ). Indeed, a detailed analysis of
the linear stability reveals the presence of an unstable mode
[38].

The lower branch instead has c− → 0 as η → ∞ and it
describes a physical solution with average degree increasing
with η/λ. Numerical analysis of the stability matrix shows
that this branch is indeed dynamically stable.

The critical point ηc(q) at which the ℓ = 1 solution con-
verges to λ when q → 2, which is the point where the ℓ = 0
solution ceases to exist. So the transition is continuous for
q = 2 and there is only one branch. For q = 10 we ﬁnd
ηc = 2.27989...λ and for large q we ﬁnd ηc ∝ log q.

In summary, the system has either one or two stable states,
depending on the values of q and η/λ. For η < ηc only the
solution ℓ = 0 is stable, for η > λq/2 only the solution ℓ = 1
is stable. Finally in the interval ηc < η < λq/2 there are two
stable solutions. The coexistence region [ηc, λq/2] shrinks to
a single point when q = 2 and it gets larger as q increases.

Figure 7 shows plots of hki against η/λ for q = 10 for both

simulations and the theory described here.

FIG. 8: Plots of mean connectivity k against time for networks start-
ing in an initially unconnected state with n = 5000 and q = 10 and
λ = 1. The curve on the top right is η = 20 and the other is η = 10.

Concerning the degree distribution, it is worth noticing that
the ℓ = 0 solution is characterized by a trivial Poisson dis-
tribution for the whole random graph. Since hki = c− < 1,
there is no giant component and the system is composed of
many disconnected components of few nodes. The solution
with ℓ = 1 is however non-trivial. In this case we have a net-
work whose p(k) is the sum of two Poisson distributions, one
of which has c+ > 1 and thus a giant component, whilst the
other (consisting of q − 1 separate networks plus the k = 0
nodes) has c− < 1 and thus has no giant component.

Even if ℓ > 1 states are unstable, they may occur in the
early stages of the stochastic evolution of the network. Figure
8 shows time-series plots of simulations for relatively large η
(η = 10, 20), starting in an initially unconnected state. Al-
though the η = 10 solution eventually reaches its expected
value of hki ∼= 20, its approach to that value is not smooth
as might have been expected. Rather we ﬁnd that the net-
work spends some time in an intermediate ℓ > 1 metastable
state. As we move to η = 20, the time spent in metastable
states increases substantially, failing to reach the stationary
ℓ = 1 state (where hki ∼= 40) despite the relatively long simu-
lation time. The reason for this behavior is that initially more
than one giant component forms, with different values of σ.
This state persists for a typical time tmeta which is inversely
proportional to the eigenvalue of the unstable mode. Hence
tmeta ∼ 1/µ ∼ ec+ η/(λc2
+) becomes very long when c+ is
large. The reason why the dynamics is so slow depends on
the fact that in order for nodes to migrate from one compo-
nent σ to another one, they have to loose all their links. Such
a process is limited by the density pσ,1 of nodes in compo-
nent σ with k = 1, which is very small when c+ is large
(pσ,1 ∼ e−cσ ).

In such a situation introducing a stochastic element in
agents’ choice (i.e. switching on T > 0) or allowing for the
formation of uncoordinated links (i.e. ǫ > 0) would make the
system converge very fast to the coordinated state. In other
words, this is a case where a ﬁnite “temperature” may allow
the agents to ﬁnd the global optimum more quickly and it

10

might be rational for agents to resort to a stochastic choice
rule. The ability to ﬁnd an optimal state more quickly is also
of advantage if there are external (exogenous) shocks which
occasionally perturb the system.

C. Discussion

The T = 0 case is of particular interest because it can be
solved exactly. For the other models described here, the co-
ordination/correlation of the nodes were too complex for us
to analyse exactly. In this section we have exactly solved a
non-trivial network model. This was possible because of the
fact that an agent only changes its spin if it has degree zero.
The network is found to be the sum of q Poissonian random
graphs [39].

VIII. CONCLUSION

In this paper we have proposed a general theoretical setup to
study the dynamics of a social network that is ﬂexible enough
to admit a wide variety of particular speciﬁcations. We have
studied three such speciﬁcations, each illustrating a distinct
way in which the network dynamics may interact with the
adjustment of node attributes.
In all these cases, network
evolution displays the three features (sharp transitions, re-
silience, and equilibrium co-existence) that empirical research
has found to be common to many social-network phenomena.
Our analysis indicates that these features arise as a conse-
quence of the cumulative self-reinforcing effects induced by
the interplay of two complementary considerations. On the
one hand, there is the subprocess by which agent similarity
is enhanced across linked (or close-by) agents. On the other
hand, there is the fact that the formation of new links is much
easier between similar agents. When such a feedback process
is triggered, it provides a powerful mechanism that effectively
offsets the link decay induced by volatility.

The similarity-based forces driving the dynamics of the
model are at work in many socio-economic environments.
Thus, even though fruitful economic interaction often requires
that the agents involved display some “complementary diver-
sity” in certain dimensions (e.g. buyers and sellers), a key
prerequisite is also that agents can coordinate in a number of
other dimensions (e.g. technological standards or trading con-
ventions). Analogous considerations arise as well in the evo-
lution of many other social phenomena (e.g. the burst of social
pathologies discussed above) that, unlike what is claimed e.g.
by Crane [7], can hardly be understood as a process of epi-
demic contagion on a given network. It is by now well under-
stood [40, 41] that such epidemic processes do not match the
phenomenology reported in empirical research. Our model
suggests that a satisfactory account of these phenomena must
aim at integrating both the dynamics on the network with that
of the network itself as part of a genuinely co-evolutionary
process.

One common feature of all the models discussed in this pa-
per is that stable states can have either a single giant compo-

nent or none. Many real situations are characterized by stable
states with a multitude of distinct components, barely con-
in
nected. One example is the polarization of opinion (e.g.
politics) where the tendency of individuals to have opinions
similar to those of the peers they interact with may also lead
to the segregation of the population in different communities,
of like mined individuals. The results presented here suggest
that there must be a speciﬁc mechanism which is responsi-
ble for such a polarization. We hope that future work in this

direction may shed some light on this issue.

[18] We recall that saying that a Poisson process occurs at a rate r
is equivalent to saying that it occurs with probability rdt, inde-
pendently, in any inﬁnitesimal time interval [t, t + dt).

[30] In order to derive such an equation, ﬁx a small time interval
dt. If νdt ≫ 1 the number of updates on each site will be
large and hence, by the central limit theorem, the corresponding
increments in the hi’s are well approximated by a deterministic
term equal to the expected value of the r.h.s. of Eq. (1), times
dt, plus a random Gaussian contribution.

[38] In this case there are q − 2 eigenmodes describing mass transfer
across σ > 1 components (i.e. ǫ1 = 0,
σ ǫσ = 0) and two
eigenmodes with ǫ1 6= 0 and ǫσ = ǫ0 for σ > 1. One of these
is unstable.

[39] The fact that the sub-graphs are Poissonian (that they are fully
speciﬁed by their degree distribution) is linked to the fact that
we could ﬁnd an exact solution.

Abstract

The Kinetic Gas theory like two-agent money exchange model, recently introduced
in the Econophysics of wealth distributions, is revisited. The emergence of Boltzmann-
Gibbs like distribution of money to Pareto’s law in the tail of the distribution is exam-
ined in terms of 2 × 2 transition matrix with a general and simpliﬁed outlook. Some
additional interesting results are also reported.
Introduction

Econophysics of Wealth distributions [1] is an emerging area where some Statistical
Physicists and Economists have been engaged in interpreting real economic data of
money, wealth and income of all kinds of people pertaining to diﬀerent societies and
nations. Economic activities have been assumed to be analogous to elastic scattering
processes [3, 4, 5]. Analogy is drawn between Money (m) and Energy (E) where
temperature (T ) is average money (< m >) of any individual at equilibrium. Some
early attempts [2] have been made to understand the income distributions which follow
Pareto’s law (P (m) ∝ 1/mα+1) at the tail of the distributions with the index (α)
varying from 1 to 2.5.

Kinetic Gas theory like models are introduced to exploit apparent similarities be-
tween a many particle system and a social system of many agents. The primary attempt
is to understand the distributions of money/ income corresponding to diﬀerent classes
of people. We revisit such a Kinetic theory like two-agent money exchange model as
recently proposed by Chakrabarti and group [4, 6]. In this model any two agents chosen
randomly from a number of agents (N ) are allowed to interact (trade) stochastically
and thus money is exchanged. Stochasticity is introduced in terms of a parameter
0 < ǫ < 1 into the interaction. One arrives at a Boltzmann-Gibbs (exponential)-type
distribution (P (m) ∝ exp(−βm)) of individual money.
In the next stage, a saving
propensity factor (λ) is incorporated to show that the distribution shifts away from
the exponential distribution. A peak appears at a value other than at zero. In the
later stage the saving propensity factor is made random (among the agents) but frozen
in time. This brings a distribution qualitatively diﬀerent from the earlier: one gets
a power law at the tail of the distribution. This indicates the emergence of Pareto’s
Law (P (m) ∝ 1/mα+1) at the tail of the distribution which is well known among
i mi)
Economists/ Econophysicists. In the above class of models total money (M =
of all the agents is invariant in time. Also the money (m) is conserved locally which
means the sum of money of two agents before and after trade (interaction) remains
constant: mi(t + 1) + mj(t + 1) = mi(t) + mj(t).

We systematically examine the role played by the parameters ǫ and λ in this con-
served class of models and attempt to understand the emergence of behaviours in
terms of probability distribution functions (P (m)) of money (m). Also we come across
additional interesting features in the model with variable saving propensity (λ).

The time evolution of money in the model without saving propensity is described

as follows:

mi(t + 1) = ǫ(mi(t) + mj(t))

mj(t + 1) = (1 − ǫ)(mi(t) + mj(t)),

(2)

Therefore, we can say that the distribution in money is evolved through 2 × 2

transition matrices (T ):

T =

ǫ

ǫ

 

1 − ǫ 1 − ǫ !

The above matrix is, however, singular which means the inverse of this matrix does
not exit. This indicates that the evolution through such transtion matrices is bound
to be irreversible. As a result we get exponential (Boltzmann) distribution of money.
This can be perceived here in a diﬀerent way too. When we take a product of such
matrices and we get back one which is nothing but the leftmost matrix:

ǫ

ǫ
1 − ǫ 1 − ǫ !  

 

ǫ1

ǫ1

ǫ

ǫ

1 − ǫ1 1 − ǫ1 !

 

1 − ǫ 1 − ǫ !

=

The above signiﬁes the fact that when two agents happen to interact repeatedly
(via this kind of transition matrices), the last of the interactions is what matters (the
last matrix of the product survives). This ’loss of memory’ may be attributed to the
path to irreversibility in time here.

Let us play the game in a diﬀerent way. Suppose two agents trade (interact) in

such a manner that we may arrive at the following general transition matrix:

T1 =

ǫ1

ǫ2

 

1 − ǫ1 1 − ǫ2 !

where ǫ1 and ǫ2 are two independent random fractions varying between 0 and 1 (but
not equal). This simply signiﬁes that ǫ1 fraction of money of the 1st agent added with
ǫ2 fraction of money of the 2nd agent is retained by the 1st agent after the trade. The
rest of their total money is shared by the 2nd agent. This is a little generalization of the
earlier case. However, this matrix is now nonsingular (as long as ǫ1 6= ǫ2) and the two-
agent interaction process may be said to be reversible in time. Therefore, we expect to
have an equilibrium distribution of money which may be qualitatively diﬀerent from
the earlier exponential (Boltzmann-Gibbs like) one. In the above general matrix, if we

put ǫ1 = 1 and ǫ2 = 0, this reduces to an Identity matrix I = (

) which is the

stationary and trivial case (no interaction).

In Fig.1 we plot two distributions (for ǫ1 = ǫ2 and ǫ1 6= ǫ2) in support of the above
discussions. The computer simulation is performed on a system of N =1000 agents.

Two agents are selected randomly to interact (trade). No qualitative change is seen
in the distributions when we take diﬀerent system sizes. A single interaction between
any two agents is deﬁned here as a single time step. Simulation is done for 105 time
steps and averaging is done over 104 initial conﬁgurations. The distributions, we plot
here, are not normalized.

Figure 1: Distribution of money(m) in two cases: Exponential curve is for the case when the
transition matrix is singular (no time reversal symmetry), the other curve with a peak is for
the case when the transition matrix is made non-singular by choosing ǫ1 6= ǫ2.

Let us now look at the case where a saving propensity factor λ is incorporated [4].
When two traders/ agents meet, each of them is supposed to keep aside λ-fraction
(ﬁxed) of their individual money (This is like a gamble with precaution.). Rest of
the money ((1 − λ)-fraction of the sum of their total money) is redistributed (between
them) with the stochasticity factor ǫ (0 < ǫ < 1). The transition matrix now looks
like:

λ + ǫ(1 − λ)
(1 − ǫ)(1 − λ) λ + (1 − ǫ)(1 − λ) !
We may now rescale the matrix elements by assuming ˜ǫ1 = λ + ǫ(1 − λ) and

ǫ(1 − λ)

 

˜ǫ2 = ǫ(1 − λ) in the above matrix. Therefore, the above transition matrix reduces to

T2 =

˜ǫ1

˜ǫ2

 

1 − ˜ǫ1 1 − ˜ǫ2 !

Thus the matrix T2 is of the same form as T1. Here, as 0 < ǫ < 1 and λ is something
between 0 and 1, we do have 0 < ˜ǫ1 < 1 and 0 < ˜ǫ2 < 1. As long as ˜ǫ1 and ˜ǫ2 are
dﬀerent, the determinant (∆ = ˜ǫ1 − ˜ǫ2 = λ) of the matrix is nonzero. Therefore,
the eﬀect of the saving propensity factor λ, thus introduced, essentially leads to have
non-singular transition matrix. Hence it is clear from the above discussion that the
distribution (in money) would likely to be qualitatively no diﬀerent from what can
be achieved with transition matrices like T1 with ǫ1 and ǫ2 (ǫ1 6= ǫ2), in general.

3

The distributions obtained for diﬀerent λ (as reported in [6]) may correspond to the
diﬀerence in ǫ1 and ǫ2 as we see.

In the next stage, when the saving propensity factor λ is made random, the tran-
sition matrix between any two agents having diﬀerent λ’s (say, λ1 and λ2) would now
look like:

λ1 + ǫ(1 − λ1)
(1 − ǫ)(1 − λ1) λ2 + (1 − ǫ)(1 − λ2) !

ǫ(1 − λ2)

 

Again we rescale the elements by putting ˜ǫ1 = λ1 + ǫ(1 − λ1) and ˜ǫ2 = ǫ(1 − λ2). Hence
this matrix can also be reduced to the same form as that of T2.

T3 =

˜ǫ1

˜ǫ2

 

1 − ˜ǫ1 1 − ˜ǫ2 !

The determinant here is ∆ = ˜ǫ1 − ˜ǫ2 = λ1(1 − ǫ) + ǫλ2. Here also ∆ is ensured to be
nonzero as all the parameters ǫ, λ1 and λ2 have the same range: between 0 and 1. This
means that each transition matrix for two-agent money exchange remains non-singular
which signiﬁes the interaction process to be reversible in time. We may also check here
that 0 < ˜ǫ1 < 1 and 0 < ˜ǫ2 < 1, which again corresponds to the transition matrix T1 as
discussed before. Therefore, it may be apparent that qualitatively diﬀerent distributions
are possible when we appropriately tune the two elements ǫ1 and ǫ2 in the general form
of transition matrix T1 (We have not done so here in this paper to explicitly demonstrate
that further.). Nevertheless the incorporation of the parameter λ goes a step closer to
interpret real economic data. However, the emergence of power law tail (Pareto’s law)
in the distribution is not well understood in the model[6] we are discussing.

In this context, we present an additional interesting feature of the model (as pro-
posed in [6]) with variable saving propensity (λ). Suppose, we consider λ to have only
two ﬁxed values λ1 and λ2 and that they are widely diﬀerent. This may be thought
of the society to have only two kinds of people: some of them do save a very large
fraction (ﬁxed) of their money and the other kind of people who save a very small
fraction (ﬁxed) of their money. Introducing this binary-λ in the model brings out an
interesting feature: a double-peak distribution in money which can be seen from Fig.2
(This result is also obtained by simulating a system of N =1000 agents.). Thus two dis-
tinct economic classes appear out of this. It has been observed that the system evolves
towards a distinct two-peak distribution as the diﬀerence in λ1 and λ2 is increased
systematically. Later it is seen that we still get two-peak distributions even when λ1
and λ2 (one high and the other low) are distributed in a narrow range around their
ﬁxed values.

P

The class of models here we discuss is conserved. The sum of money of all the
i mi is ﬁxed for all time. This is ensured by the two-body interaction
agents M =
process (rule of the game) where the sum of money of the two agents is conserved before
and after interaction as mentiond in the beginning. So the sum of two elements of a
t12
t22
1, t12 + t22 = 1. Whatever extra parameter we add in the model, no matter, the
matrix has to retain this property. (However, an extra parameter, like λ, may help

) has to be unity by design: t11 + t21 =

explaining things better.) Therefore, this kind of conserved models, in general, may be
understood in terms of a general transition matrix like T1 as discussed in the beginning.
T1 essentially tells that one agent retains randomly ǫ1-fraction (0 < ǫ1 < 1) of his own
money added with random ǫ2-fraction (0 < ǫ2 < 1) of the other, where the other keeps
the rest.

Abstract

The most common stochastic volatility models such as the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU),

the Heston, the exponential OU (ExpOU) and Hull-White models deﬁne volatility as a

Markovian process. In this work we check of the applicability of the Markovian approxi-

mation at separate times scales and will try to answer the question which of the stochastic

volatility models indicated above is the most realistic. To this end we consider the volatil-

ity at both short (a few days) and long (a few months)time scales as a Markovian process

and estimate for it the coeﬃcients of the Kramers-Moyal expansion using the data for

Dow-Jones Index. It has been found that the empirical data allow to take only the ﬁrst

two coeﬃcients of expansion to be non zero that deﬁne form of the volatility stochastic

diﬀerential equation of Itˆo. It proved to be that for the long time scale the empirical data

support the ExpOU model. At the short time scale the empirical model coincides with

ExpOU model for the small volatility quantities only.

1. Introduction

The stochastic volatility (SV) models with continuous time have been introduced into

literature in late of 80-s of the last century [1, 2, 3, 4]. According to these models the

market dynamics is the two-dimensional stochastic process in which the asset price St

obeys the stochastic diﬀerential equation in the Itˆo form ( the index t is omitted for

simplicity)

dS = µSdt + σSdW1(t),

(1)

where the parameter µ is the drift coeﬃcient, W1(t) is a standard Wiener process and σt

is the volatility considered as a stochastic variable.

The empirical analysis have established two important stylized facts concerning with

the volatility. Firstly, this process has a long memory emerging, in particular, in that the

autocorrelation function absolute returns decay very slowly with time. One can separate,

at least, two characteristic time scales in the behavior of the autocorrelation function.

At the initial stage there is a fast decay on the short time scale of the order of few days

followed by the slow decay during a few months, deﬁning the long time scale. Secondly,

there is the negative correlation between past returns change and future volatility (so-

called ”leverage” eﬀect).

At the present diﬀerent SV models are discussed in literature. To a certain extent these

models are based either on the model of the geometrical Brownian motion or originate from

Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process. It is assumed that volatility is a function σ = g(Y )

of a stochastic process Yt and that the dynamic equation for Yt can be represented as a

stochastic diﬀerential equation in Itˆo form

dY = α(m

Y )dt + f (Y )dW2(t),

(2)

−

σ = g(Y ) .

Eq.(2) deﬁnes the so-called class of mean-reverting processes in which Yt goes to mean

value m at t

with the velocity α.The quantity 1/α is the time of relaxation of σ to its

→ ∞

equilibrium value approximately equal to g(m) and actually represents the characteristic

time scale of the process. The Wiener process W2(t) in general is correlated with the

process W1(t).

2

Depending on g and f one can distinguish basically four frequently used SV models.

1) The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) model [1, 2] with σ = Y and f (y) = k, where k is a

positive constant and

dσ = σ(m

2) The exponential Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (ExpOU) model [1] with σ = ey and f (y) = k > 0,

where it is assumed that Y = ln σ follows to the OU process and variable σ, as it is easy

to show in this case, satisﬁes the equation

dσ = σ

3)The Heston model [3] where σ = √y and f (y) = k√y, (k > 0). In this model it is

assumed that the volatility is the OU process of the form (3).

4) The Hull-White model [4]with σ = √y, f (y) = ky, (k > 0)) and

Originally the parameters of the models 1) - 4) were being estimated by a ﬁtting to the

empirical data from options pricing. Lately the question about the applicability of one or

the other stochastic volatility model for describing a time evolution of stock prices, market

indices or exchange rates is actively discussed in the physical literature. The fundamental

problem is ﬁnding the most realistic model and estimating its parameters.

One of the approaches is that parameters of a model are estimated by ﬁtting the

theoretical probability distribution functions (PDF) of returns to the empirical curves.

So the studies carried out in works [5, 6, 7, 8] have showed that the Heston model well

enough reproduce the empirical distributions for Dow - Jones Index and a number of

stocks. On the other hand, in the case of the high-frequency data, the Heston model, as

well as Hull-White model, applied to German DAX Index give the return distributions

not conforming to tails of the empirical curves [9](see also [10]).

The alternative approach is to estimate the parameters of the above models in such a

way as to reproduce other the market stylized facts.In particular, in works [11, 12, 13, 14]

the parameters of the OU, Heston and ExpOU models have been estimated by comparison

of the theoretical predictions to the observed leverage eﬀect.

It has been showed that

3

these models qualitatively reproduce the observed eﬀect as a result of the choice of the

parameters, however, the empirical data do not allow to assert the most appropriate

model. As regards the autocorrelation function, in contrast with other models, ExpOU

qualitatively reproduces the behavior of the empirical curve at medium and long times by

ﬁtting the parameters. On the other hand in order to take into account the occurrence

of two time scale in the work [15] (see also [16]) a three dimensional diﬀusion model,

assuming that the mean reverting level m is random, has been introduced.

Thus by ﬁtting the parameters above SV models sometimes can reproduce well enough

the probability densities of the returns or describe speciﬁc observed authoritativeness (the

leverage eﬀect, behavior of autocorrelation function). However the question of choice of

most realistic stochastic volatility model still remains open.

Models 1) - 4) determinate the volatility as a Markovian process. This follows from

the well-known fact that solutions of a SDE of Itˆo have the Markovian properties [17].

At the same time the empirical volatility autocorrelation function, decaying very slowly

with time, shows , in general, the non-Markovian behavior. Furthermore as it has been

noted above the autocorrelation function has at least two characteristic time scales. In

this connection it is worth noting that the empirical analysis reveals the presence of a

well-separated time scales in the dynamics of the volatility itself.

So, LeBaron in [18] has showed that the SV model, where the volatility behavior at

short (

1 day), medium (

5 weeks) and long (

5 years) time scales is deﬁned by three

∼

∼

∼

diﬀerent stochastic processes, reproduces power law in the asymptotic of log returns of

the Dow-Jones Index and long memory in the volatility ﬂuctuations.

In the work of J.-P. Fouque at al [19] (see also [20]) volatility dynamics both at short

(a few days) and long (few a months) time scales was considered within the scope of

the ExpOU model but with diﬀerent relaxation times for each scale. For S&P 500 high-
frequency data the short time scale has been found of order α−1

1.5 days.

∼

In this work we want to check the application of the above SV models separately both

at short and long the time scales. If at the speciﬁc time scale the Markovian approximation

is applicable, then the coeﬃcients of the SDE of Itˆo written as

dσ = D1(σ)dt +

2D2(σ)dW2(t)

expansion. Such approach has recently been used in [22, 23] and allowed directly from

the data to estimate the coeﬃcients of SDE of Itˆo for returns handling high-frequency dy-

namics of DEM/USD exchange rates. Here this method is applied to both high-frequency

and low-frequency data. The SDEs of the form (6) obtained for this two data sets have to

deﬁne the volatility behavior both at short and long time scales. In the end this gives an

opportunity to make a comparison with the known SV models and, to a certain extent, to

answer the question of how consistent one or the other model is with the empirical data.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is devoted to describing the method of

determination of the volatility time series. In Section 3 the coeﬃcients of the Kramers-

Moyal expansion have been obtained for diﬀerent time scales. In Section 4. the numerical

solution of the Fokker-Plank equation for conditional PDF is given and the convergence of

the solutions to the stationary distributions is considered for both time scales. In section 5

on the basis of the obtained SDE for volatility the simulation of the return series is carried

out and its properties are studied. The analysis of the results is given in conclusion.

2. The estimation of volatility and data sets

Unlike prices changes the volatility is not directly observed. At the present there are

a diﬀerent methods of its estimation (for example, see [14, 24]). Most frequently the

volatility at the moment of time t is estimated as the standard deviation

The two diﬀerent data sets have been used for the empirical analysis:

the high-

frequently data set (HFD) for the Dow-Jones Index (data sampled at 5 min intervals

5

from Feb. 16, 2001 to Feb. 26, 20051) and low-frequently data (LFD) (with daily data

for the Dow-Jones Index from Jan. 2, 1990 to Feb. 25, 20052). One has respectively

∆ = 5 min, T=2 hours for HFD and ∆ = 1 day, T=1 month (21 days) for LFD. The

non-overlapping intervals of averaging T have been used for calculation of the volatility

given Eq.(8) and respectively the sampling time interval for the volatility data equals T.

The obtained empirical values σt have been used for the construction of the stationary

distributions of the volatility and the conditionals PDFs. In doing so it has been assumed

that the volatility is a stationary process [14].

3. The estimation of the Kramers-Moyal coeﬃcients

According to what was said in the introduction we shall consider the volatility on the

above indicated time scales in the Markovian approximation. In this case, as it is known,

the conditional probability density obeys a master equation in the form of a Kramers-

Moyal expansion [21].

In this section we shall calculate the coeﬃcients D1 and D2 of the expansion (9) and

show that with enough accuracy the data set allows to take D4 to be zero. According to

Pawla’s theorem [21] at D4 = 0 all coeﬃcients Dk with k

3 vanish and the equation (9)

≥

reduces to a Fokker-Plank equation. In this case it is coeﬃcients D1 and D2 that deﬁne

the form of SDE for volatility of the form (6).

For the calculation of the moments Mk the conditional densities p(˜σ, t + ∆t
|

σ, t) (see

Fig.4) have been determinated from the empirical data and the numerical integration in

(11) has been performed. Further the approximation of the limiting passage ∆t

0 in

→

(10) has been employed and coeﬃcients D1 and D2 have been obtained.

Fig.1 shows some typical dependence of the moments M1,2 of ∆t. In order to obtain

the moments M1,2(σ, ∆t) for the case of the small ∆t, the volatility given Eq.(8) has been

calculated using the overlapping intervals T. At the small σ the moments M1,2 are well

enough described by the linear dependence on ∆t. Therefore the limit in (10) has been

approximated as follows

(12)

at ∆t = T . At large σ values of moments ﬂuctuate drastically because of the decrease of

the statistical data. Nevertheless here too limit (10) has been approximated by relation-

ship (12) at ∆t = T .

The results of the calculation of the coeﬃcients D1,2(σ) given by Eqs.(10-11) are shown

in Fig.2. It has turned out that for both data sets D1(σ) can be approximated well enough

by the function that coincides in form with the drift coeﬃcient of the ExpOU model (4)

(Fig.2a; 2c). For approximation of the coeﬃcient D2(σ) for LFD the square dependence

on σ has been used (Fig. 2d). For HFD for the small σ, D2(σ) can also be approximated

by the square dependence on σ, however, for large σ it increases faster then the square

function. Therefor for approximation D2(σ) for all σ the function has been used

D2(σ) = b1σ2 exp(b2σ).

In the result of the ﬁtting we have obtained:

do not exceed 10−2 for HFD and 3

corresponding values of D1 and D2.

4. The numerical solution of the Fokker-Plank equation

As it has been noted in the previous section at D4 = 0 the master equation (9) reduces

to the Fokker-Plank equation

of this equation is consistent enough with the empirical densities.

given in [22] has been used.

The conditional densities p(σ, t

σ0, t0) for diﬀerent times t are represented in Fig.4. As

it is shown from Fig.4a for high-frequency data the stationary state is reached within t

≃
1.5 days (from this on time the theoretical curves practically coincide). For low-frequency

data the stationary state is settling within the time of the order of 5 months (Fig.4c). As

it is shown from Fig.4b;4c the theoretical stationary distributions are consistent enough

with the empirical volatility densities. To some extent this fact can serve as validation of

estimating the coeﬃcients D1,2.

5. The simulation of the return series

As it is known [17, 21] the Fokker-Plank equation (18) is equivalent to the SDE of Itˆo of

the form

This equation in combination with Eq.(1) enables to perform the simulation of the prices

series that gives an opportunity to obtain a theoretical return PDF.

In order to eliminate the parameter µ in Eq.(1) let us introduce the new variable

xt = ln St/S0 −

µt, where S0 is the initial price. It is easy to obtain that

dxt =

dt + σtdW1(t).

(20)

Using Eqs.(19) and (20) and the explicit form of the coeﬃcients D1 and D2 for both

data sets we have generated the series xt. The Wiener processes W1(t) and W2(t) have

been assumed to be independent. The found price series have been used for the plotting

of the probability density and the autocorrelation function of the absolute log-returns.

Fig.5 represents the plots of PDF of the prices changes

from both the generated price series and the empirical data. As it is seen there is a good

agreement between the corresponding curves.

The plots of the autocorrelation function of the absolute log-returns

are given

|

in Fig.6. In the case of high-frequency dynamics (Fig.6a) there is a rapid decay of the

empirical autocorrelation function at the time of the order of one day followed by a more

slow decrease (solid line). The generated curves reproduces this abrupt drop (dashed line)

at time of the order of 1.5 days. The same behavior is also exhibited for S&P500 Index

[19]. The periodic oscillations of the empirical correlation function arises from a stable

increase of the trade activity at both the beginning and the end of day.

In the case of low-frequency dynamics the generated autocorrelation function repro-

duces the initial drop of the empirical curve at times of the order of two months (Fig.6b).

6. Conclusion

The SV models introduced in [1, 2, 3, 4] deﬁne the volatility as a Markovian process.

On the other hand the volatility autocorrelation function shows the existence of two or

9

more characteristic times,which, in general, is not typical for the Markovian processes.

In recent works [18, 19, 20] the SV models have been considered, describing volatility as

a superposition of Markovian processes with diﬀerent characteristic times. Using these

approaches we consider volatility at both short and long time scales in the Markovian

approximation. On the basis of the empirical data, employing Eqs.(10) and (11), we

estimated the coeﬃcients D1,2 of Ito SDE deﬁning the volatility dynamics. It has been

shown that for the long time scale the empirical data support the ExpOU model with the
characteristic time α−1 = 2.43 months (see Eqs.(16) and (17)). On the short time scale
the drift coeﬃcient can also be described within the scope of this model with α−1 = 0.79

days (Eq.(14)). As regards the diﬀusion coeﬃcient it shows more complicated behavior

than a simple square dependence (see Eq.(15)).

On the base of the numerical solution of the Fokker-Plank equation we have considered

the time evolution of the conditional PDF p(σ, t
|

σ0, t0).

It has been shown that the

stationary state settles in accordance with the found relaxation times within time of the

∼

2/α, where for the long time scale tL ∼

order t
tS ∼
and the empirical curves (Fig.4). This fact supports the validity of estimating of the

1, 5 days. Very good agreement is found between the calculated stationary densities

5 months and for short time scale

coeﬃcients D1,2.

On the basis of Eqs (19) and (20) the price series xt has been generated and PDFs of

the price changes ∆xt = xt −
of a correlation between the Wiener processes W1(t) and W2(t) the agreement between

xt−∆ for the diﬀerent time delays ∆ obtained. In the absence

the simulated and empirical densities for both time scales is good enough (Fig.5).

On the basis of the generated data the volatility autocorrelation function has been

obtained. The empirical autocorrelation function within the interval of a few months

shows the existence of at least two characteristic time scales (Fig.6). At the initial stage

there is a drop within approximately 0.5 days followed by a slow decay. As it is seen from

Fig.6 the generated data at both short (within

0.5 days) and long (within

2 months)

∼

∼

time scale separately describe such behavior.

The obtained results deserve attention especially if one takes into account that the

parameters D1,2 were not ﬁtted specially to neither the empirical densities nor the behavior

of autocorrelation function.

10

The parameters of the ExpOU model for the Dow-Jones Index were estimated in

other works also. In [14] it has been shown that the ﬁtting of the theoretical curve to

the empirical volatility autocorrelation function at the interval of a few months gives the

estimation of the relaxation time of the order of 35

18 days. On the upper bound this

±

estimation is close to our results for LFD.

On the other hand the derivation of SDE for the volatility on the basis of the empirical

data was also considered in [26]. The equation obtained in this work for the low-frequency

dynamics of the Dow-Jones Index is close enough to the Eq.(4) of the ExpOU model.

Numerical solution the the Fokker-Plank equation for the conditional PDF has shown

that the stationary state settles within 3-4 months, which approximately corresponds to

our data.

Thus the results reported in this work show that the employment of the Markovian

approximation at the individual time scale in all probability allows to describe at this

scale a number of market appropriateness. In particular we have shown that the volatility

autocorrelation function and the probability return densities obtained within the scope

of this approximation are consistent enough with their empirical analogues separately at

both short and long time scales.

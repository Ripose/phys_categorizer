Summary. In the spirit of Richardson’s original (1948) study of the statistics of deadly conﬂicts,
we study the frequency and severity of terrorist attacks worldwide over the past 38 years, and
show that these events are uniformly characterized by the phenomenon of scale invariance,
i.e., the frequency scales as an inverse power of the severity, P (x) ∝ x−α. We show that this
property is a robust feature of terrorism, existing in terrorism that targets both industrialized and
non-industrialized countries, across different weapon-types and even over short time-scales.
We show that the scaling exponent ﬂuctuates about α = 2.5, that the center of the distribution
oscillates slightly with a period of roughly τ ≈ 13 years, and that current models of event
incidence cannot account for the variation in event severity or the scale invariance property of
global terrorism. Finally, we propose a simple toy model for the generation of these statistics,
and brieﬂy discuss its implications.

Introduction

Richardson ﬁrst introduced the concept of scale invariance, i.e., a power-law scaling between
dependent and independent variables, to the study of conﬂict by examining the frequency
versus severity statistics of large and small conﬂicts (Richardson, 1948). His work demon-
strated that for both wars and small-scale homicides, the frequency of an event scales as an
inverse power of the event’s severity (in this case, the number of casualties). Richardson,
and subsequent researchers, found that the frequency of wars of a size x scale as P (x) ∝ x−α,
where α ≈ 2 and is called the scaling exponent. Recently, power-law statistics have been
found to characterize a wide variety of phenomena include natural disasters such as earth-
quakes, ﬂoods and forest ﬁres (Bak and Tang, 1989; Turcotte et al., 1998; Newman, 2005),
the distribution of city sizes, the number of citations for scientiﬁc papers and the frequency
of words in language (Zipf, 1949; Simon, 1955; Newman, 2005), among others. As a re-
ﬂection of their apparent ubiquity, it has even been said, somewhat pejoratively, that such
extremal statistics are “more normal than normal” (Lun et al., 2005). What distinguishes
the power law distribution from the normal distribution is its heavy tail, i.e., there is a

non-trivial amount of weight far from the center of the distribution. This in turn implies
that events orders of magnitude larger (or smaller) than the mean are relatively common;
the power-law distribution is one particular kind of heavy-tailed distribution and is most
commonly identiﬁed by a straight line with slope α on doubly-logarithmic axes. We refer
to Newman (2005) for more details on power laws, their properties and their measurement.

Here, we extend Richardson’s program of study to the most topical kind of conﬂict:
terrorism. Speciﬁcally, we empirically study the distributional nature of the frequency
and severity of terrorist events worldwide since 1968. Although terrorism as a political
tool has a long history (Congleton, 2002), it is only in the modern era that small groups
of so-motivated individuals have had access to extremely destructive weapons (FBI, 1999;
Shubik, 1997). Access to such weapons has resulted in severe terrorist events such as the
20 March 1995 release of the Sarin nerve agent in a Tokyo subway which injured or killed
over 5000, the 7 August 1998 car bombing in Nairobi, Kenya which injured or killed over
5200, or the more well known attack on 11 September 2001 in New York City which killed
2749. Conventional wisdom holds that these rare-but-severe events are outliers, i.e., they
are qualitatively diﬀerent from the more common smaller terrorist attacks that kill or injure
only a few people. Although that impression may be true from an operational standpoint,
it is false from a statistical standpoint. The frequency-severity statistics of terrorist events
are scale invariant and, consequently, there is no fundamental diﬀerence between small and
large events; both are consistent with a single underlying distribution. This in turn suggests
that there is no reason to expect that “major” or more severe terrorist attacks should require
qualitatively diﬀerent explanations than less salient forms of terrorism.

Just as research on conﬂict has tended to study war as a dichotomous event rather than
their magnitude or severity of violence (Cedeman, 2003; Lacina, 2006), empirical research
on terrorism has almost exclusively focused on terrorist incidents, without distinguishing
between their severity or lethality.1 An adequate model of terrorism should not only give
us indications of where or when terrorist events are likely to occur, but also be able to
generate the observed frequency distribution of terrorist events and their severity. Later
in this paper we will examine to what extent models proposed to account for the location
of terrorist incidents can also account for diﬀerences in their severity. We ﬁrst start with
a brief overview of data on terrorism, and examine the frequency and severity of terrorist
attacks.

1An important exception is Bogen and Jones (2006), but they focus primarily on aggregate ﬁgures
in assessing whether there is an increase in the severity of terrorism over time and forecasting
mortality due to terrorism.

maximum likelihood method. Details of ﬁts for these distributions are given in Table 1.

2. Data sources for terrorist events

Many organizations track terrorist events worldwide, but few provide their data in a form
amenable to scientiﬁc analysis. The most popular source of information on terrorist events
in the political science literature is the ITERATE data set (Mickolus et al., 2004), which
focuses exclusively on transnational terrorist events involving actors from at least two coun-
tries. In principle, however, at least from the standpoint of frequency and severity statis-
tics, we see no reason to restrict our analysis to transnational events. Instead, we use the
data contained in the National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism (MIPT)
database (MIPT, 2006), which largely overlaps with the ITERATE data, but includes fully
domestic terrorist events, as well. We note, however, that our analyses are easily be applied
to the portion of the ITERATE data that reports event severity; doing so yields evidence
similar to that which we present here. Thus, without loss of generality and except where
noted, we will focus exclusively on the MIPT data for the remainder of the paper. The
MIPT database is itself the compilation of the RAND Terrorism Chronology 1968-1997,
the RAND-MIPT Terrorism Incident database (1998-Present), the Terrorism Indictment
database (University of Arkansas & University of Oklahoma), and DFI International’s re-
search on terrorist organizations.

At the end of 2005, the MIPT database contained records for over 24 602 terrorist events
in more than 4500 cities across 187 countries worldwide between 1968 and 2005. Although
alternative deﬁnitions for terrorism exist, the MIPT database uses a relatively standard one
that may be summarized as any violent act intended to create fear for political purposes.
Each entry in the database is quite narrow: it is an attack on a single target in a single

4

Clauset, Young and Gleditsch

location (city) on a single day. For example, the Al Qaeda attacks in the United States on
11 September 2001 appear as three events in the database, one for each of the locations:
New York City, Washington D.C. and Shanksville, Pennsylvania. Each record includes the
date, target, city (if applicable), country, type of weapon used, terrorist group responsible
(if known), number of deaths (if known), number of injuries (if known), a brief description
of the attack and the source of the information.

Of the nearly twenty-ﬁve thousand recorded events, 8 438 of them resulted in at least one
person being injured or killed, and we restrict our analyses to these events as they appear to
be the least susceptible to any reporting bias. Further, it is reasonable to assume that large
events, as a result of their severity both in terms of casualties and political repercussions,
will have more reliable severity estimates. However, we also note that a proportionally small
under- or over-estimate of the severity of any event will have only a small eﬀect the results
of our statistical analysis and will not change the core result of scale invariance. As with
Richardson’s study of the severity of wars, simply obtaining the correct order of magnitude
of an event reveals much of the basic scaling behavior. Throughout the remainder of the
paper, we will deﬁne the severity of an event to be either the number of injuries, the number
of deaths, or their sum, where the severity is always greater than zero. Unless otherwise
noted, we focus exclusively on the statistics of these values.

3. Frequency-severity distributions for attacks since 1968

Collecting all events since 1968 as a histogram of severity, we show their cumulative dis-
tribution functions P (X ≥ x) in Figure 1. The regular scaling in the upper tails of these
distributions immediately demonstrates that events orders of magnitude larger than the
average event size are not outliers, but are instead in concordance with a global pattern
in the frequency statistics of terrorist attacks. Signiﬁcantly, the scaling exists despite large
structural and political changes in the international system such as the fall of communism,
the type of weapon used, recent technological developments, the demise of individual terror-
ist organizations and the geographic distribution of events. In subsequent sections, we will
examine the robustness of the scale invariance to both categorical and temporal analysis.

If we make the idealization that events are independent and identically distributed
(i.i.d.), we may model the distribution as a power law with some exponent α. Obviously, sig-
niﬁcant correlations between many events exist, but for the sake of a parsimonious model, we
ignore that fact for the moment. Using the method of maximum likelihood (Newman, 2005),
we use the data to estimate the scaling exponent α and the lower-limit of the scaling be-
havior xmin. Models found in this way are summarized in Table 1. Statistically, we ﬁnd
by using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test that these i.i.d. models are surprisingly good for
representing the death- and total-severity distributions (pKS > 0.99 and pKS > 0.9, respec-
tively), and that there is insuﬃcient evidence to reject it as a model of the injury-severity
distribution (pKS > 0.05).2

In Section 7, we will see that the quality of the total-severity model improves when we
decompose it into component distributions, each of which is strongly scale invariant, but
with diﬀerent scaling and limit parameters. As mentioned earlier, the power law is not the
only distribution with a heavy tail, and although testing all such alternatives is beyond

2The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test evaluates whether observed data seem to be a plausible random
i.i.d. sample from a given probability distribution by comparing the maximum diﬀerence between
the observed and the expected cumulative distributions.

the scope of this paper, we tested another common distribution, the log-normal (see, for
instance, Serﬂing (2002)), and found in all cases that we may reject this model (pKS < 0.05).

Scale Invariance in the Severity of Terrorism

4. Evolution of terrorism over time

Because events in the database are annotated with their incidence date, we may order them
so as to produce a time-series by which to investigate properties of the severity distribution
as a function of time.3 Although our ultimate interest is in the property of scale invariance
over time, we will ﬁrst consider a more simple measure of the distribution’s shape, the
average log-severity. Sliding a window 24 months wide over the 38 years of event data,
we compute the average log-severity (deaths) of events within each window. For highly
skewed distributions, such as those we show in Figure 1, the average log-severity measures
the position on the independent axis of the distribution’s center in a way that reduces its
sensitivity to the variations, from the occasional presence of rare-but-severe events, in the
range of the upper tail. The resulting time series of this measure is shown in the upper-pane
of Figure 2, with standard error bounds. Notably, this function is largely stable over the
38 years of data in the MIPT database, illustrating that the center of the distribution has
not varied substantially over that time. A close examination of the ﬂuctuations, however,
suggests the presence of potential periodic variation. We investigate this possibility by
taking the autocorrelation function (ACF) of the time series, which is shown in the lower-
pane. The noticeable sinusoidal shape in the ACF shows that the ﬂuctuations do exhibit a
strong degree of periodicity on the order of τ ≈ 13 years. Notably, the size of the sliding
window does not substantially eﬀect either the magnitude of the auto-correlation or its
periodicity, and we have examined results for windows of 12 to 60 or more months (data
not shown). Thus, we conjecture that this periodicity is, in fact, a natural feature of global
terrorism, although we have no explanation for its origin.

5. Scale invariance over time

Turning now to the question of scale invariance, we use a similar sliding-window method-
ology to partition events into discrete groups. Here, we take a window of 60 months to
ensure the presence of enough data to reasonably estimate the power-law parameters under
our methodology. We plot the resulting time-series of scaling exponents for the frequency-
severity (deaths) distributions in Figure 3a, but omit data points that are not statistically
signiﬁcant; the dashed lines indicate standard error bounds, and the solid line illustrates
the slight linear trend in the inferred parameter time-series. The corresponding statistical
signiﬁcance measures are shown in the upper-pane of Figure 3b, the inferred values of xmin
in the middle-pane, and the average inter-event interval, i.e., the average delay between
events worldwide, is shown in the lower-pane.

3In 1998, the management of the database was transferred from the RAND Corp. to the MIPT,
which resulted in several observable diﬀerences in record entries in the database. For instance, the
number of entries dramatically increased immediately afterward (see the bottom-pane of Figure 3b),
suggesting that the true number of events in the database for some period directly prior to 1998
is greater than we observe in the database. Although this biasing event could create problems for
analyses that count incidents, it does not eﬀect the scale invariant shape of the frequency-severity
distribution, primarily, we believe, because the large events in the tail of the distribution were the
least susceptible to any under-reporting bias.

autocorrelation function of the average log-severity, illustrating a strong periodicity in the breadth of
the distribution at roughly τ ≈ 13 years.

The ﬂuctuations around the value α = 2.5 agree with the conclusions we draw from
the average log-severity time-series (Fig. 2) in the previous section, i.e., the shape of the
distribution of the severity of terrorist events has not changed substantially over the past
38 years. Under the idealized assumption that events are drawn i.i.d.
from a power-law
distribution, the emergence of extremely severe events in recent years can be attributed to
the continual rise in the frequency of attacks. The lower-pane of Figure 3b illustrates that
the average number of events (or here, its reciprocal, the mean inter-event interval) per unit
time has been steadily increasing. In heavy-tailed distributions, this implies a progressively
deeper exploration of the tail of the distribution, i.e., the incidence of progressively more
severe events. Although the assumption of i.i.d.
is clearly an idealization, it is surprising
how well it captures the dynamics and properties of the severity distribution.

One might seek to explain the increase in the frequency of events, a fact that is consistent
with the most recent report on global trends in terrorism by the United States Department
of State (2004), by normalizing the incidence rate to the world population. For example, the
inter-event interval falls from ∆t ≈ 168 hours, for the period 1975 – 1979, to ∆t ≈ 9 hours
for 2001 – 2005. Between these periods, the world’s population only doubled (roughly),
while the frequency of terrorist events increased almost twenty-fold. This suggests that the
true change in the nature of global terrorism over the recent past is not in the frequency-
severity distribution, which has remained stable for decades, but rather in the frequency
with which events are drawn from that distribution.

6. Variation in scale invariance by target-country industrialization

Let us now examine the impact of industrialization on the frequency-severity distribution
of terrorist events worldwide – given that each attack is executed within a speciﬁc country,
we may ask whether there is a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the scaling behaviors of events within
industrialized and non-industrialized countries. We divide the events since 1968 into those
that occurred within the 30 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) nations (1282 events, or 18%), and those that occurred throughout the rest of
the world (5806 events, or 82%). We plot the corresponding total-severity distributions in
Figure 4a (also summarized in Table 2).

Most notably, we ﬁnd substantial diﬀerences in the scaling of the two tail distributions,
where industrialized-nation events scale as αOECD = 2.06(9) while non-industrialized-nation
events scale more steeply, as αnon−OECD = 2.46(7). The moral here is that while events
have, to date, been less likely to occur within the major industrialized nations, when they
do, they tend to be more severe than their non-industrialized counterparts. Although this
distinction is plausibly the result of technological diﬀerences, i.e., industrialization itself
makes possible more severe events, it may also arise because industrialized nations are
targeted by more severe attacks for political reasons. We leave the exploration of such
questions for the future.

7. Variation in scale invariance by weapon-type

As our last characterization of the scale-invariant frequency-severity distribution, we con-
sider the connection between technology, represented by the type of weapon used in an
attack, and the severity of the event. Figure 4b shows the total-severity distributions
for chemical or biological weapons, explosives (including remotely detonated devices), ﬁre,

ﬁrearms, knives and a catch-all category “other” (which also includes unconventional4 and
unknown weapons). We ﬁnd that these component distributions themselves exhibit scale
invariance, each with a unique exponent α and lower limit of the power-law scaling xmin.
However, for the explosives and chemical or biological weapons distributions, we must make
a few caveats. In the latter case, the sparsity of data reduces the power of our statistical
tests, while for the former, there is clearly another phenomenon at play in the lower tail.
We summarize these distributions and their power law models in Table 2.

Through this partitioning of events, we can now see that the origin of the bending in
the lower tail of the injuries distribution (Fig. 1a) is from explosive attacks , i.e., there
is something special about attacks utilizing explosives that makes them signiﬁcantly more
likely to injure small or moderate numbers of people than one would expect from the
power-law model. However, this property fails for larger events and the scaling resumes
in the upper tail. In contrast, we see no such change in the scaling behavior in the lower
tail for other weapons – this demonstrates that the property of scale invariance is largely
independent of the choice of weapon. Further, by partitioning events according to their
weapon-type, we typically recover high estimates of statistical signiﬁcance (pKS > 0.95).

8. A regression model for the severity of terrorist events

There is an extensive literature on what factors promote terrorism and make governments
more likely to become targets of terrorism. We refer to Pape (2003), Reich (1990), and
Rosendorﬀ and Sandler (2005) for overviews of existing studies of terrorism. Notably,
however, existing studies say nothing about the severity-frequency distribution of events,

and empirical research on terrorism has tended to focus predicting terrorist incidence. In this
section, we consider to what extent models proposed to predict the incidence of terrorism
data can account for the severity of terrorism, and reproduce the observed frequency-severity
distribution.

As an example of empirical studies on the frequency of terrorist incidents, we use a
recent study by Li (2005). He explores empirically the impact of a large number of political
and economic factors hypothesized to make transnational terrorist incidents more or less
likely. In particular, he argues that while some features of democratic institutions such as
greater executive constraints tend to make terrorist incidents more likely, other features
such as democratic participation are associated with fewer incidents. Model (1) in Table 3
displays the coeﬃcient estimates for Li’s original results from a negative binomial regression
of the number of transnational terrorist, with each country-year as the unit of observation.
We refer to the original Li (2005) article for all details on variable construction, etc.

Since our data are based on terrorist incidents that are not limited to transnational
events,5 we ﬁrst replicate the Li model for incidents in the MIPT data to ensure that
our results are not an artifact of systematic diﬀerences between transnational and domestic
terrorist events. The coeﬃcient estimates for the Li model applied to the number of incidents
in the MIPT data shown as Model (2) in Table 3 are generally reasonably similar to the
results for original model, suggesting that the model behaves similarly when applied to the
two sources of data on terrorism.

Next, we examine to what extent the right-hand side covariates in the Li model allows
to predict to diﬀerences in the severity of terrorism. Model (3) in Table 3 displays the
results for a negative binomial regression of the number of deaths among the lethal events
in the MIPT data. Comparing the size of the coeﬃcient estimates to their standard errors
suggest that none of these coeﬃcients are distinguishable from 0, with the possible excep-
tion of the estimate for Europe and the post-cold war period. In other words, none of the
factors proposed by Li seem good predictors of the severity of terrorist events. Moreover,
the proposed Li model fails to generate predictions that in any way resemble the observed
variation in the number of deaths: the largest predicted number of deaths for any observa-
tion in the observed sample is less than 10, far below the actual observed maximum of 2749

5Recall, however, that our analysis of the ITERATE data shows that transnational terrorism

also exhibits scale invariance.

Scale Invariance in the Severity of Terrorism

(i.e., the 11 September 2001 attack on the World Trade Center). The original Li model
examines the number of incidents by country-year, and it may therefore be argued that
looking only at events with casualties could understate the possible success of the model in
identifying countries that are unlikely to become targets of terrorist incidents. The results
for the Li model applied to the total events for all country-years, Model (4) in Table 3,
however, do not lend much support to this. Very few of the features emphasized by Li
have coeﬃcient estimates distinguishable from 0 by conventional signiﬁcance criteria, and
the highest predicted number of deaths for any one country-year in the sample is still less
than 16. As such, this model is clearly not able to generate the upper tail of the observed
severity distribution.

9. A toy model for scale invariance through competitive forces

As we have seen in the previous section, a standard regression model for event incidence is a
poor predictor of event severity, and it fails to reproduce the observed scale invariance in the
tail of the frequency-severity statistics. Thus, it is reasonable to turn to alternative models
to explain this robust statistical feature. Power laws themselves can arise from a wide vari-
ety of processes (Newman, 2005; Mitzenmacher, 2004; Farmer and Geanakoplos, 2005). For
disasters such as earthquakes, ﬂoods, forest ﬁres and wars, the model of self-organized criti-
cality (SOC) (Bak et al., 1987), a physics model for equilibrium critical phenomena6 in spa-
tially extended systems, appears to be the most reasonable explanation (Bak and Tang, 1989;
Turcotte et al., 1998; Cedeman, 2003) as events themselves are spatial. However, such mod-
els seem ill-suited for terrorism, in which the severity of an event is not directly related to
its spatial extent.

One trivial model for the frequency-severity scale invariance would be a tight connection
with size of the targeted city and the number of casualties. That is, because city populations
are distributed as a power law, we may suppose that an event’s severity is proportional
to the size of the target city.
If target cities are chosen roughly uniformly at random,
an obviously unrealistic idealization, then a power law in the frequency-severity statistics
follows naturally. Tabulating population estimates for cities in our database from publicly
available census data, we ﬁnd that the correlation between an event’s severity and the
target city population is very weak, r = 0.2(2) for deaths and r = 0.2(1) for total-severity,
where the number in parentheses is the standard error from a bootstrap resampling of
the correlation calculation. A regression model on other characteristics of the target cities
may yield better results. However, as an alternative explanation of the origin of this scale
invariance, we now propose and analyze a simple, non-spatially extended toy model of a
competitive process between states and non-state actors. We note that this process is similar
to the exponential sampling scheme described in Reed and Hughes (2002).

Consider a non-state actor (i.e., a terrorist) who is planning an attack. Intuitively, the
more severe an event is to be, the more planning it will require. Reversing this relationship,
we say that the size of the planned event grows with time, up to some ﬁnite limit imposed
perhaps by the choice of weapon (as suggested by Fig. 4), the choice of target, or the
available resources. If we further assume that the rate at which additional planning pays
oﬀ is proportional to the amount of time already invested, i.e., increasing the severity of a

dynamics.

well-planned event is easier than for a more ad hoc event, then the severity of a planned
event will be p(t) ∝ eκt, where κ > 0 is a constant. However, many planned events are
prevented from becoming a reality for a variety of reasons. To model this selection process,
we say that the probability that a planned event will be executed is exponentially related
to its size, ie., the larger the event, the more chance such an eﬀort will be abandoned,
executed before planning is complete, the actor incarcerated by the state, or that the eﬀort
will simply fail. Thus, we may say that the severity of a real event is related by x ∝ eλt,
where λ < 0 is a constant. To derive the distribution of events that actually occur, we must
solve the identity

p(x) dx =

p(t) dt ,

a transformation of variables between the potential severity distribution and the actual
severity distribution. Doing so yields p(x) ∝ x−α where α = 1 − κ/λ. It may be plausible
that both state and actors will, through a process much like co-evolution of parasites and
hosts, develop roughly equal capabilities, but perhaps with a slight advantage toward the
state by virtue of its longevity relative to terrorist organizations, such that |κ| & |λ|. In
this case, we have a power law with exponent α & 2, in approximate agreement with our
empirical data.

Naturally, the geopolitical and cultural factors relevant to a speciﬁc terrorist attack are
extremely complex, and our toy model intentionally omits them. The development of more
realistic models, perhaps by incorporating tools from evolutionary game theory, is a topic
that we propose for the future.

10. Discussion and conclusions

Many of the traditional analyses of trends in terrorism are comparative, descriptive, his-
torical or institutional, and those that are statistical rely on assumptions of normality and
thus treat rare-but-severe events as qualitatively diﬀerent from less severe but common
events (Reich, 1990; FBI, 1999; Dept. of State, 2004; Rosendorﬀ and Sandler, 2005). We
show that these assumptions are fundamentally false, by demonstrating that Richardson’s
discovery of scale invariance in the frequency-severity statistics of wars extends to the same
statistics for terrorism. Notably, however, the estimates of the scaling behavior for wars
diﬀers substantially from that which we observe for terrorism, i.e., the frequency-severity
of wars scales very slowly, with αwar = 1.80(9) while the distribution scales much more
steeply for terrorism, αdeaths = 2.36(7). Taking Richardson’s study of wars in conjunction
with our study of terrorism, we may now make the conjecture that scale invariance is a
universal law for the severity of deadly human conﬂicts, and that it is the diﬀerences in the
type of conﬂict that determine the particular scaling behavior, i.e., the value of the scaling
exponent α and the lower-limit of the scaling xmin, as was the case for the weapon-type
distributions shown in Figure 4.

The strength of our scale invariance results for terrorism prompts us to consider whether
existing studies of terrorism can account for this empirical feature. These studies have
suggested many useful models of the strategic behavior underlying resort to terrorism,
as well as the likely eﬀectiveness of speciﬁc forms of government interventions, in partic-
ular with respect to possible substitution eﬀects, where terrorist may resort to alterna-
tive targets and techniques as particular targets become relatively more diﬃcult to at-
tack (Enders and Sandler, 2006). However, despite Richardson’s (1948) evidence for scale

Scale Invariance in the Severity of Terrorism

invariance in the severity of war, researchers have ignored the same phenomenon in the
severity of terrorist events. From a policy perspective, this and the other empirical reg-
ularities we describe will be helpful in both forecasting the severity distribution of future
terrorist attacks, forecasting trends in the severity of global terrorism, and in contingency
planning, since most eﬀorts to thwart terrorist violence or address its origins are unlikely
to completely eradicate all resort to terrorism, at least in the short run. Further, an ac-
counting of the severity of events, in addition to other aspects such as the target, strategy
and weapon-type, will beneﬁt policy makers in deciding how to allocate resources for the
prevention of terrorism.

At a more fundamental level, adequate models to understand and explain terrorism
must be able to generate the known empirical facts about its distribution, and research
on terrorism will need to explore what possible micro-level mechanisms can give rise to
the observed statistical regularities at the macro-level. Although we do not claim to have
provided anything beyond a ﬁrst and very simple generative model in this work, we hope that
our results presented here can serve as starting point for further research in this direction.

Appendix A: Statistical methodology

Since Richardson ﬁrst considered the scale invariance in the frequency and severity of wars,
statistical methods for characterizing power laws have advanced signiﬁcantly. The signature
feature of a tail distribution that decays as a power law is a straight-line with slope α on
doubly logarithmic axes. As such, a popular method of measuring the scaling exponent α
has been least-squares regression on log-transformed data, i.e., one takes the log of both the
dependent and independent variables and measures the slope using a least-squares linear ﬁt.
Unfortunately, this estimator for the scaling exponent is known to yield biased estimates of
the scaling exponent (Goldstein et al., 2004). An unbiased estimator can be derived using
the method of maximum likelihood (Newman, 2005), and is given as

αML = 1 + n

n

−1

,

xi
xmin #

"

i=xmin
X

where xmin denotes the lowest value for which the scaling holds, i.e., it denotes the beginning
of the tail distribution and n is the number of observations in the tail. Typically, xmin is
estimated visually, and, when the data span many orders of magnitude, a conservative
estimate of xmin is suﬃcient. For the terrorist events, the severity data only spans a few
orders of magnitude and a conservative estimate would result in an underpopulated tail.
This would, in turn, give our tests little statistical power. To ameliorate this problem,
we use a numerical method for selecting the xmin that yields the best power-law model
for the data. Speciﬁcally, for each xmin over some reasonable range, we ﬁrst calculate the
maximum likelihood exponent αML on the data X ≥ xmin, and measure the Kolmogorov-
Smirnov (KS) goodness-of-ﬁt statistic when comparing the data being ﬁt and a theoretical

14

Clauset, Young and Gleditsch

power-law distribution with parameters αML and xmin. We then select the xmin that yields
the best ﬁt to our data under this test. For simulated data with similar characteristics to
the MIPT data, we ﬁnd that this method correctly estimates both the lower bound on the
scaling and the scaling exponent. Mathematically, we say that

xmin = min

where F (x; y, α) is the theoretical cumulative distribution function (cdf) for the power law
with parameters α and xmin = y, and ˆFn(x; y) is the empirical distribution function (edf)
for the n observed data points greater than y.

Once the parameters for the power law have been estimated, we then measure the
standard error in α via bootstrap. The errors reported in Tables 1 and 2 for α are derived
in this manner. The statistical signiﬁcance value is derived by a Monte Carlo simulation
of data drawn from Fn(x; α, xmin), where α and xmin have been estimated as above, under
the one-sided KS test. Tabulating the results of the simulation yields an appropriate table
of p-values for the ﬁt.

As mentioned in the text, there are many heavy-tailed distributions, e.g., the q-exponential
, the stretched exponential e−αxβ

e−αx
, the log-normal, and even a diﬀerent two-parameter
q
power law (c + x)−α. For data that span only a few orders of magnitude, the behavior of
these functions can be statistically indistinguishable. As such, we cannot rule out all Type
II statistical errors for our power law models; however, we note that for the distributions
described in Section 3, the statistical power test versus a log-normal model indicates that
the power law better represents the empirical data.

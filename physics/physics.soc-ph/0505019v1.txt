We review recent results on the dynamics of social networks which suggest that the interplay
between the network formation process and volatility may lead to the occurrence of discontinuous
phase transitions and phase coexistence in a large class of models. We then investigate the eﬀects of
negative links – links inhibiting local growth of the network – and of a geographical distribution of
the agents in such models. We show, by extensive numerical simulations, that both eﬀects enhance
this phenomenology, i.e. it increases the size of the coexistence region.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Recent phenomenological studies on complex networks in the social sciences have uncovered ubiquitous nontrivial
statistical properties, such as scale free distribution of connectivity or small world phenomena [1, 2, 3]. These
properties have striking consequences on the processes which take place on such networks, such as percolation [4],
diﬀusion [5, 6], phase transitions [7, 8] and epidemic spreading [9]. The research on complex networks raises questions
of a new type as it addresses phenomena where the topology of interactions is part of the dynamic process. This
contrasts with traditional statistical mechanics, where the topology of the interaction is ﬁxed a priori by the topology
of the embedding space.

Phenomena of this type are quite common in social sciences where agents purposefully establish cooperative links
[10]. Links between individuals in a social network support not only the socioeconomic interactions that determine
their payoﬀs, but also carry information about the state of the network. This aspect has important consequences
in the long run if the underlying environment is volatile. In this case, former choices tend to become obsolete and
individuals must swiftly search for new opportunities to oﬀset negative events. The role of the network for information
diﬀusion is particularly apparent, for example, pertaining to the way in which individuals ﬁnd new job opportunities.
For example, it has been consistently shown by sociologists and economists alike [11, 12] that personal acquaintances
play a prominent role in job search. This, in turn, leads to a signiﬁcant correlation in employment across friends,
relatives, or neighbours. The common thesis proposed to explain this evidence is that, in the presence of environmental
volatility, the quantity and quality of one’s social links – sometimes referred to as her social capital [13]– is a key basis
for search and adaptability to change.

A recent statistical mechanics approach to simple models of social networks has recently shown that the interplay
between volatility and the quest for eﬃciency leads, in a broad class of models, to a positive feedback loop between
the network’s structure and its dynamics [14, 15]. As a result, social networks may exhibit sharp phase transitions –
i.e. a dense network may emerge or disappear [16] suddenly – coexistence of diﬀerent network phases for the same
parameters and resilience – i.e. robustness of a dense social network even when external conditions deteriorate beyond
the point where a dense network ﬁrst came into existence. This generic conclusion was derived in two qualitatively
[14] addressed the interplay between volatility and search in a model where agents use their
diﬀerent setups: Ref.
links to look for new fruitful collaborations. Ref. [15] found instead the same phenomenology in generic models where
proximity or similarity favours the formation of links among agents and, conversely, the presence of links between two
agents enhances similarity. As discussed in Ref. [15], there are several socio-economic phenomena, ranging from job
contact networks and research collaborations to the spread of crime and other social pathologies, for which anecdotal
evidence has been reported.

Such dynamic eﬀects (e.g. sharp transitions) are much more diﬃcult to detect in empirical studies than static
properties (e.g. scale-freeness or small-worldness). Hence, the empirical veriﬁcation of the scenarios proposed in Refs.

[14, 15] requires very accurate data, which is rarely available in socio-economic sciences. A diﬀerent way to check the
validity of the scenario in generic cases is to challenge its robustness on theoretical grounds, including eﬀects which
have been neglected so far. Here, in particular, we address two simplifying assumptions of the models of Ref. [14, 15]:
i) that network formation is long ranged, i.e.
independent of a geographical distribution of the agents and ii) that
links always have a positive eﬀect on the link formation process.

We discuss these eﬀects in the framework of the model of Ref. [14] where they enter in an important way into the
dynamics of the network (see later). In both cases, we ﬁnd by extensive numerical simulations, that inclusion of these
eﬀects enhances the character of our conclusions (i.e. it increases the co-existence region in parameter space). This
supports the conclusion that sharp transitions, co-existence and resilience are generic dynamic properties of social
networks.

In what follows we shall ﬁrst review the model of Ref.

[14], then turn to the study of negative links and ﬁnally

discuss the inclusion of geographical eﬀects.

II. SEARCHING PARTNERS IN A VOLATILE WORLD

Ref.

[14] proposes a stylized model of a society that embodies the following three features: (i) agent interaction,
(ii) search and (iii) volatility (i.e. random link removal). Individuals are involved in bilateral interactions, as reﬂected
by the prevailing network. Through occasional update, some of the existing links have their value deteriorate and
are therefore lost. In contrast, the individuals also receive opportunities to search that, when successful, allow the
establishment of fresh new links.

Formally, the network is given by a set of nodes N and the corresponding adjacency matrix A(t) with elements
aij(t) = 1 if there is a link connecting nodes i and j at time t, and aij = 0 otherwise (we assume no on-site loops,
aii = 0 and un-oriented links aij = aji). Denote by Fi = {j|aij = 1} the set of neighbours (“friends”) of the node i.
The matrix A(t) follows a stochastic process governed by the following three processes:

Long distance search: At rate η, each node i gets the opportunity to make a link to a node j randomly selected (if

the link is already there nothing happens).

Short distance search: At rate ξ, each node i picks at random one of its neighbours j ∈ Fi and j then randomly
selects (i.e. “refers to”) one of its other neighbours k ∈ Fj\{i}. If k 6∈ Fi then the link between i and k is
formed. If Fi = ∅ or Fj = {i} or k ∈ Fi nothing happens.

Decay: At rate λ, each existing link decays and it is randomly deleted.

Over time, this process leads to an evolving social network that is always adapting to changing conditions. For
ξ = 0, the dynamics is very simple and the stationary network is a random graph with average degree c = 2η/λ. For
η ≪ λ the network is composed of many disconnected parts. Fig. 1 reports what happens when the local search rate
ξ is turned on. For small ξ, network growth is limited by the global search process that proceeds at rate η. Clusters of
more than 2 nodes are rare and, when they form, local search quickly saturates the possibilities of forming new links.
Suddenly, at a critical value ξ2, a giant component connecting a ﬁnite fraction of the nodes emerges. The average
degree c indeed jumps abruptly at ξ2. The distribution p(c) of ci is peaked with an exponential decrease for large c
and a power law p(c) ∼ cµ for c small. The network becomes more and more densely connected as ξ increases further.
But when ξ decreases, we observe that the giant component remains stable also beyond the transition point (ξ < ξ2).
Only at a second point ξ1 does the network lose stability and the population gets back to an unconnected state.
There is a whole interval [ξ1, ξ2] where both a dense-network phase and one with a nearly empty network coexist.
This behaviour is typical of ﬁrst-order phase transitions. The coexistence region [ξ1, ξ2] shrinks as η increases.

In loose words, the model shows that the continuous struggle of agents’ continuous search must be strong enough
to oﬀset volatility if a dense and eﬀective social network is to be preserved. On the other hand, search can be eﬀective
only in a densely networked society. So information diﬀusion and a dense network of interactions are two elements
of a feedback self-reinforcing loop. As a result, the system displays a discontinuous phase transition and hysteresis,
enjoying some resistance to a moderate deterioration of the underlying environmental conditions. Such a resilience can
be interpreted as consequence of the buﬀer eﬀects and enhanced ﬂexibility enjoyed by a society that has accumulated
high levels of social capital.

These features are captured by a mean ﬁeld theory which is in good qualitative agreement with numerical simulation
results (see Ref. [14]). This theory highlights the particular role that clustering plays in the dynamics of the model.
Indeed search is particularly eﬀective when clustering is low whereas it is suppressed in a high clustered society. The
average clustering coeﬃcient q – deﬁned as the fraction of pairs of neighbours of i who are also neighbours among
themselves[18] – shows a non-trivial behaviour. In the unconnected phase, q increases with ξ as expected. In this

FIG. 1: Average degree c (top) and clustering coeﬃcient q (bottom) from numerical simulations with η/λ = 0.01 for populations
of size n = 1000. Here and in all other ﬁgures, runs were equilibrated for a time teq = 3000/λ before taking averages for a
further 3000/λ. The network was started in both the low connected and high connected state for each value of ξ. For the
central coexistence region, the two distinct points for each ξ represent the two diﬀerent starting conﬁgurations. The arrows
show the hysteretic region, the rightmost arrows indicating ξ2. The right hand graph shows the phase diagram, black squares
denote the coexistence region, red circles the regions in which only the low (lower left) or high (upper right) phases are stable.

phase, q is close to one because the expansion of the network is mostly carried out through global search, and local
search quickly saturates all possibilities of new connections. On the other hand, in the dense-network phase, q takes
relatively small values. This makes local search very eﬀective. Remarkably we ﬁnd that q decreases with ξ in this
phase, which is rather counterintuitive: increasing the rate ξ at which bonds between neighbours form through local
search, the density q of these bonds decreases. In fact, similar behaviour is found if, ﬁxing ξ and η, the volatility rate
λ decreases.

These conclusions rest on two basic assumptions, which might be unrealistic in practical cases. The ﬁrst is that
links have always a positive eﬀect on the formation of other links. Indeed, “negative” links (i.e. animosity) may have
an important eﬀect in inhibiting link formation. If one of the my possible friends has a negative relation with a friend
of mine, I might not wish to form the link with him/her, because this would increase the “frustration” of my social
neighbourhood. It is indeed a well accepted fact in social science [17] that social relationships evolve in such a way as
to decrease frustration.

The second assumption of the model, is that agents are treated equivalently in the global search process. In many
real cases, agents are located in a geometrical space and this inﬂuences the likelihood with which they establish new
links among themselves. Notice that a dependence of the link formation rate on proximity in space has arguably
strong consequences on clustering, which is a key aspect of the model.

In both cases, as we shall see, the inclusion of these eﬀects enhances the non-linear eﬀect and result in an even

wider region of coexistence.

III. THE EFFECT OF NEGATIVE LINKS

Here we extend the model to include the eﬀect of negative links. In addition to the long-range search, introduction
of friends, and decay of links, we also include negative links. These links model the eﬀect of animosity between nodes.
Thus, when two nodes i and j are introduced, before they form a positive link they check through all their neighbours
to see if any of them have a negative link with their prospective neighbour. They are in eﬀect using their contacts
to check the ’references’ of their prospective neighbour. If there are one or more negative links (or if i and j already
have a negative link) then the new connection is not formed.

Negative links themselves are formed by the ‘souring’ of existing positive links at a rate γ. In other words, every
link is positive when it is created, but it may turn to negative at rate γ. Once formed, negative links decay at rate
λ− which we set equal to λ for simplicity except when stated otherwise.

This additional mechanism has two eﬀects on the network: ﬁrstly, positive links now disappear at a rate λ+γ rather
than λ as before. Secondly, the rate of introduction of nodes through mutual friends (the ξ process) is reduced. Since

it is the nonlinearity of the ξ process that produces the coexistence region, one might expect this to have important
eﬀects on the size and location of the coexistence region.

Figure 2 shows plots for four values of γ. As γ is increased, the value ξ2 above which the low connected state
becomes unstable increases markedly – indeed for γ = 0.1 the value of ξ at which the transition occurs (for the times
of 3000 + 3000 studied here) is around ξ = 20. Also, the average degree of the network in the connected region
decreases and the value ξ1 below which the connected region collapses moves slightly up. The overall eﬀect is that
the coexistence region gets larger and moves slightly to higher values of ξ when γ increases.

of size n = 1000. Original case γ = 0 (black circle), γ = 0.01 (red square), γ = 0.02 (green plus), and γ = 0.1 (blue cross). The
arrows indicate the approximate locations of ξ2 for each value of γ.

More dramatic eﬀect occurs for large values of γ. Figure 3 shows that the system may enter into a regime where the
network undergoes successive rises and crashes due to the spread of animosity. This behavior also sets in if negative
links are much more stable than positive ones (λ− ≪ λ, lower panel of Fig. 3). Then once a connected society is
formed, its network of relationships gets slowly poisoned with long lasting negative links, which inhibit the formation
of other positive links.

We believe that the occurrence of such time-dependent behaviours is intimately related to the phase coexistence of
the original system. Here the low connectivity state is unstable, over some mean waiting time, to the formation of
the highly connected state. However the highly connected state is also not stable once a suﬃciently large number of
links have turned to negative links. The system thus alternates between the two states, but not in a periodic manner
due to the stochastic nature of the process.

IV. THE EFFECT OF GEOMETRY

We now consider another important eﬀect not considered in the original model, that of the physical space in which
the agents live. We introduce a modiﬁed version of the model which accounts for the fact that agents embedded in
space are more likely to make random acquaintances with other agents who are geographically near to them.

We modify the original model in the following way: We embed the agents on a one-dimensional periodic lattice of
length n, with agent i being placed at a distance i from the origin. When creating long-range links (the η process),
we select site i at random and then site j with a probability P (dij ) which decays with the distance dij between i and
j on the lattice.[19] We studied distributions of the form P (d) ∝ d−α (α > 0) decays with distance.

Notice that the local search process ξ can only connect members of a community of already connected agents. It
is only by the η process that such a community can reach agents further away. Hence we expect that a sharp decay
of P (d) with distance has strong eﬀects on the η process, which is the limiting factor in the nucleation of a dense
network,[20] thus increasing the stability of the low density phase. Figures 4 conﬁrm this expectation for the case
P (d) ∼ d−α with α = 1,2. The main change occurs for α = 2 where the stability of the low connectivity phase and
hence the coexistence region is signiﬁcantly extended. Notice also that well inside the dense network phase there is no
signiﬁcant eﬀect. This conﬁrms that this phase is sustained by the local search process alone: once a global network
spanning the whole system is formed, geometry has no eﬀect.

because links between close agents are more likely to exist already and cannot be added again.

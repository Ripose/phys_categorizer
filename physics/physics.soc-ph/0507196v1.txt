Abstract

EC paper authors form a complex network of co-authorship which is,
by itself, a example of an evolving system with its own rules, concept of
ﬁtness, and patterns of attachment. In this paper we explore the network
of authors of evolutionary computation papers found in a major biblio-
graphic database. We examine its macroscopic properties, and compare it
with other co-authorship networks; the EC co-authorship network yields
results in the same ballpark as other networks, but exhibits some distinc-
tive patterns in terms of internal cohesion. We also try to ﬁnd some hints
on what makes an author a sociometric star. Finally, the role of proceeding
editorship as the origin of long-range links in the co-authorship network is
studied as well. Keywords: Evolutionary computation, sociometric stud-
ies, complex networks, scale-free networks, power laws, co-authorship net-
works.

1 Introduction

The study of all kind of networks has undergone an accelerated expansion in
the last few years, after the introduction of models for power-law (Barab´asi and Albert, 1999)
and scale-free networks (Watts and Strogatz, 1998), which, in turn, has induced
the study of many different phenomena under this new light. One of them
have been co-authorship networks: nodes in these networks are paper authors,
joined by edges if they have written at least a paper in common. Even as most

1

papers are written by a few authors staying at the same institution, science is
a global business nowadays, and lots of papers are co-authored by scientists
continents apart from each other. There are several interesting facts that can
be computed on these co-authorship networks: ﬁrst, what kind of macroscopic
values they yield, and second, which are the most outstanding actors (authors)
and edges (co-authorships) within this network. A better understanding of the
structure of the network and what makes some nodes stand out goes beyond
mere curiosity to give us some insight on the deep workings of science, what
makes an author popular, or some co-authors preferred over others.

Co-authorship networks are studied within the ﬁeld of sociometry, and, in
the case at hand, scientometry. First studies date back to the second half of the
nineties: Kretschmer (Kretschmer, 1997) studied the invisible colleges of physics,
ﬁnding that their behavior was not much different to other collaboration net-
works, such as co-starring networks in movies. However, it was at the begin-
ning of this century when Newman (Newman, 2001a; Newman, 2001b) stud-
ied co-authorship networks as complex networks, giving the ﬁrst estimations
of their overall shape and macroscopic properties. In general, these kind of
networks are both small worlds (Watts and Strogatz, 1998), that is, there is, on
average, a short distance between any two scientists taken at random, and scale
free, which means they follow a power law (Barab´asi and Albert, 1999) in sev-
eral node properties (e.g., the in-degree, or number of nodes linking a particu-
lar one) . Newman made measurements on networks from several disciplines:
physics, medicine and computer science, showing results for clustering coefﬁ-
cients (related to transitivity in co-authorship networks), and mean and max-
imum distances (which gives an idea of the shape of the network). Barab´asi
and collaborators (Barab´asi et al., 2002) later proved that the scale free struc-
ture of these co-authorship networks can be attributed to preferential attach-
ment: authors that have been more time in business publish more papers on
average, and thus get more new links than new authors. However, even as this
model satisfactorily explains the overall structure of the network, there must
be much more in the author positions in the network than just having been
there for more time. In addition to these general works, several studies have
also focused in particular scientiﬁc communities: computer support of cooper-
ative work (Horn et al., 2004), psychology and philosophy (Cronin et al., 2003),
chemistry (Cronin et al., 2004), SIGMOD authors (Nascimento et al., 2003) and
sociology (Moody, 2004), to name a few.

In this work, we analyze the co-authorship network of evolutionary com-
putation researchers. Studying this network gives us a better understanding
of its cohesiveness as a discipline, and sheds some light on the collaboration
patterns of the community. It also provides interesting hints about who are
the central actors in the network, and what determines their prominency in the
area.

2 Materials and Methods

The bibliographical data used for the construction of the scientiﬁc-collaboration
network in EC has been gathered from the DBLP1 –Digital Bibliography & Li-
brary Project– computer Science bibliography server, maintained by Michael
Ley at the University of Trier. This database provides bibliographic informa-
tion on major computer science journals and proceedings, comprising more
than 610,000 articles and several thousand computer scientists (as of March
2005).

The database provides bibliographical data indexed by author and by con-
ference/journal. This turns out to be one of its advantages since, for exam-
ple, the URL of the page containing the information for a certain author can be
used as identifying key for that author. To some extent this alleviates one of the
problems typically found in this kind of studies, namely the fact that a single
author may report his/her name differently on different papers (e.g., using the
ﬁrst name or just initials, including a middle name or not, etc.)2. Of course, this
kind of situation is still possible in this database, and indeed we have found
some instances of it. However, it seems that the maintainers of the database
have put some care in avoiding this issue.

Besides this indexing issue, the DBLP exhibits two additional advantages.
Firstly, it is a “moderated” database, meaning that it is not updated via authors’
submitting their references. On the contrary, the maintainers add themselves
new entries by inspecting published volumes, or incorporate full BibTEX col-
lections provided by publishers or editors. This eliminates a potential source
of bias in the sample of publications, i.e., some authors being very active in
submitting their bibliographical entries while other being less proactive in this
sense. Finally, the second additional advantage is the fact that DBLP pages are
highly structured and regular. Hence they are very amenable for automated
parsing by a scraping program. In particular, hyperlinks are provided for ev-
ery co-author of a paper, making navigation through the database very easy.

The process to obtain the raw data is the following: our scraping robot
is ﬁrstly fed with a collection of DBLP author keys, stored in a stack. Sub-
sequently, while this stack is not empty, a key is extracted from it, and the
corresponding HTML page is downloaded. Then, it is parsed to extract the
textual name of the author, and the papers he/she has authored. For each of
these papers, the hyperlinks of co-authors are identiﬁed, and added to the stack
(cycles are avoided by keeping track of processed authors using an ordered bi-
nary tree). An important issue to be taken into account is the fact that we are
interested in obtaining a network for the EC community. However, an EC au-
thor may also publish articles in other ﬁelds; hence, we cannot blindly parse
all entries in a certain page since non-EC papers (and later on, non-EC authors)
would be included in the network. To avoid this, we have used a double check:
ﬁrstly we look for certain patterns in the publication reference. These include

1http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/∼ley/db/
2A second kind of problem is possible: having two different authors with exactly the same

name. We are not aware of any glaring instance of this duplicity in the EC community.

the acronyms of EC-speciﬁc conferences –such as GECCO, PPSN, EuroGP, etc.–
or keywords –such as “Evolutionary Computation”, “Genetic Programming”,
etc.– that account for the relevant journals and/or additional conferences. Pa-
pers with any of these strings in its publication reference are directly classiﬁed
as EC papers and parsed as described above. If this criterion is not fulﬁlled,
then the title is scanned in order to detect another set of relevant keywords
such as “evolutionary algorithm”, “genetic algorithm”, etc., or acronyms such
as “EA”, “GA” or “GP”. Again, if a paper triggers this criterion, it is classiﬁed
as an EC paper and processed accordingly. It must be noted that this system
has turned out to be rather accurate in detecting EC papers. Actually, the vi-
sual inspection of the resulting network indicated that only a small fraction of
false positives (well below 1% of the total number of papers) passed the ﬁlters.
These were mostly computational biology papers, and were readily removed
from the network.

As a ﬁnal consideration, we have chosen a large representative sample of
authors as the seed of our search robot. To be precise, we have used a collec-
tion composed of all authors that have published at least one paper in the last
ﬁve years in any of the following large EC conferences: GECCO, PPSN, Eu-
roGP, EvoCOP, and EvoWorkshops (unfortunately, CEC is not indexed in the
DBLP; however, this does not alter the macroscopic properties of the network,
as it will be shown below). This way, the immense majority of active EC re-
searchers is guaranteed to be included in the sample. Actually, active authors
not publishing in these fora are in practice linked –directly or indirectly– with
all likelihood with authors who do publish in them. Just as an indication, the
number of authors used as seed is 2,536 whereas the ﬁnal number of authors
in the network is 5,492, that is, more than twice as many.

3 Macroscopic Network Properties

The overall characteristics of the EC co-authorship network are shown in Table
1 alongside with results obtained by Newman (Newman, 2001a). The latter
correspond to co-authorship networks in Medline (biomedical research), the
Physics E-print Archive and SPIRES (several areas of physics and high-energy
physics respectively), and NCSTRL (several areas of computer science).

First of all, the number of EC papers and authors is much smaller than
those for the communities studied by Newman; however, it must be taken into
account that these communities are much more general and comprise differ-
ent subareas. Notice also that in most aspects, EC data seems closer to the
NCSTRL database than to any other. This indicates that despite the interdisci-
plinary nature of EC, the publication practices of this area are in general those
of computer science. This way, average scientiﬁc productivity per author (2.9)
is not so high as in physics (5.1, 11.6) and biomedicine (6.4). It nevertheless fol-
lows quite well Lotka’s Law of Scientiﬁc Productivity (Lotka, 1926), as shown
by the power law distribution illustrated in Fig. 1 (left). The most interesting
feature is the long tail: while most authors appear only once in the database,

The average size of collaborations (2.56) is also smaller than in biomedi-
cal research (3.75) or high-energy physics (8.96), although similar to those of

(2.22). It also follows a power law (up from 3 authors) as shown in Fig. 1 (right).

Relevant considerations can be also done regarding the total number of col-
laborators per author (4.2); physics and biomedicine are areas in which new
collaborations seem more likely than in EC (9.7, 173.0, and 18.1). However,
the ﬁgure for NCSTRL (3.6) is lower than for EC, thus suggesting that the EC
author is indeed open to new collaborations, as regarded from a computer sci-
ence perspective. The histogram of number of collaborators per authors (not
shown) also ﬁts quite well to a power law with exponent -2.58. In this case,
this power law can be attributed to a model of preferential attachment such as
the one proposed by Barab´asi (Barab´asi et al., 2002): new authors tend to link
(be co-authors) of those that have published extensively before. However, as
we pointed out before, that cannot be the whole story. For starters, information
on who is the most proliﬁc author is not usually available (although educated
guesses can go a long way), and, besides, there are strong constraints that avoid
free linking: a person can only tutor so many PhD students at the same time, for
instance, and not everybody is ready, or able, to move to the university of the
professor she wants to work with. However, let us point out that actors with
many links do not necessarily coincide with the most proliﬁc; they are rather
persons that have diverse interests, reﬂected in their choice or co-authors, par-
ticipate in transnational projects, or have a certain wanderlust, being visiting
professors in many different institutions, which leads them to co-author papers
with their sponsors or hosts in those institutions. The fact that the clustering
coefﬁcient (that is, the average fraction of an actor’s collaborators that are col-
laborators themselves) in the EC co-authorship networks is so high, and the
mean degree of separation is so close to the proverbial six degrees, means that
in general all authors in this ﬁeld are no more than 6 degrees of separation of
those sociometric stars with a wide variety of interests, projects or visits. These
sociometric stars will be analyzed more in depth in next section.

Another interesting aspect refers to the so-called giant component. This is a
connected subset of vertices whose size encompass most of the network. The
remaining vertices group in components of much smaller size (actually, inde-
pendent of the total size of the network). As pointed out in (Newman, 2001a),
the existence of this giant component is a healthy sign, for it shows that most of
the community is connected via collaboration, and hence by person-to-person
contact ultimately. In the case of the EC network, the giant component com-
prises more than 2/3 of the network (see Fig. 2), again superior to the computer
science network, but signiﬁcantly smaller than for physics or biomedicine. This
fact is nevertheless counteracted by the high clustering coefﬁcient (actually the
highest of the set). This indicates a much closer contact among actors, since
one’s collaborators are very likely to collaborate among themselves too. It is
also signiﬁcant that the mean distance among actors is halfway between the
medical/physics communities (around 4) and the computer science commu-
nity (around 9), while diameter is the second-smallest. This shows that the EC
community is halfway between computer science and more theoretical ﬁelds,
such as physics.

authorship network. A dense core with heavily connected authors can be

collaborators.

4 Evolutionary Computation Sociometric Stars

In the previous section we have considered global collaboration patterns that
can be inferred from macroscopic properties of the network. Let us know take
a closer look at the ﬁne detail of the network structure. More precisely, we
are going to identify which actors play a more prominent role in the network,
and analyze why they are important. The term centrality is used to denote this
prominency status for a certain node.

Centrality can be measured in multiple ways. We are going to focus on
metrics based on geodesics, i.e., the shortest paths between actors in the net-
work. These geodesics constitute a very interesting source of information: the
shortest path between two actors deﬁnes a “referral chain” of intermediate sci-
entists through whom contact may be established – cf. (Newman, 2001b). It
also provides a sequence of research topics (recall that common interests exist
between adjacent links of this chain, as deﬁned by the co-authored papers) that
may suggest future joint works.

The ﬁrst geodesic-based centrality measure that we are going to analyze is
betweenness (Freeman, 1977), i.e., the total number of geodesics between any
two actors i, j that passes through a third actor k. The rationale behind this
measure lies in the information ﬂow between actors: when a joint paper is
written, the authors exchange lots of information (research ideas, unpublished
results, etc.) which can in turn be transmitted (at least to some extent) to their
colleagues in other papers, and so on. Hence, actors with high betweenness are
in some sense “hubs” that control this information ﬂow; they are recipients –
and emitters– of huge amounts of cutting-edge knowledge; furthermore, their

of the most famous books on EC, ﬁgures prominently in all rankings, as well
as Kalyanmoy Deb, who is a well known author in theoretical EC and multi-
objective optimization. The rest of the authors are well known as conference
organizers, or as leaders of some subﬁelds within EC. The three columns show
rankings for three quantities: number of co-authors, and two centrality mea-
sures: betweenness and closeness.

removal from the network would result in the increase of geodesic distances
among a large number of actors (Wasserman and Faust, 1994).

The second centrality measure we are going to consider is precisely based
on this geodesic distance. Intuitively, the length of the shortest path indicates
the number of steps that research ideas (and in general, all kind of memes)
require to jump from one actor to another. Hence, scientists whose average
distance to other scientists is small are likely to be the ﬁrst to learn new infor-
mation, and information originating with them will reach others quicker than
information originating with other sources. Average distance (i.e., closeness) is
thus a measure of centrality of an actor in terms of their access to information.
The result of our centrality analysis of the EC network is shown in Table
2. The numbers provided for each actor indicate the normalized values of
betweenness and closeness (that is, their actual values divided by the maxi-
mum possible value, expressed as a percentage). Regarding betweenness, the
analysis provides clear winners, with large numerical differences among the
top actors. These differences are not so marked for closeness values with all
top actors clustered in a short interval. Notice that there are some actors that
appear in both top-lists. Using Milgram’s terminology (Milgram, 1967), these
constitute the sociometric superstars of the EC ﬁeld.

Several factors are responsible for the prominent status of these actors. Ob-
viously, scientiﬁc excellence is one of them. This excellence is difﬁcult to mea-
sure in absolute, objective terms, but the number of collaborators provides

some hints on it3. This quantity is shown for the top ten actors in the network
in Table 2. Certainly, some correlation between degree and centrality is evi-
dent. This is further illustrated in Fig. 3 (left). As it can be seen, there is a trend
of decreasing average distance to other actors as the actor degree increases. By
crossing this information with the percentile distribution of distances shown
in Fig. 3 (right) we can obtain some interesting facts about the collaborative
strength of elite scientists. For example, consider the top 5% percentile; it is
composed of actors whose average distance to the remaining actors is at most
4.61. According to Fig. 3 (left), 23 collaborators are required at least to have an
average distance below this value. A more sensitive analysis indicates that 33
collaborators are required to have an statistically signiﬁcant (using a standard
t-test) result.

Another important factor inﬂuencing the particular ranking shown above
is the presence of conference proceedings among authors’ publications. These
play a central role in the creation and structure of the network, to the point that
its features change dramatically if links arising from proceedings co-authorship
are removed. To begin with, the visual aspect of the network is different, as is
shown in the left hand side of Fig. 4 (compare it to the network with proceed-
ings included, shown in Fig. 2). The reader should notice that the core is much
more diffuse (actually, it looks like there are several micro-cores, plausibly cor-
responding to different EC subareas).

3This quantity is strongly correlated with the number of papers (ρ = .82), and thus provides
information on the efﬁciency in knowledge transmission, which is the ultimate goal of scientiﬁc
publishing. Involvement in PhD supervision and research projects, and wide research interests
will typically result in a higher number of collaborators as well.

This change is also reﬂected in the right hand side of Fig. 4, which plots
the histogram of average distances from each node to the rest of the network:
without proceedings, the average distance and maximum distance increase by
2 units, and the modal distance increases by 3 units. The resulting distribution
is also much more symmetric than the original distribution, which was notably
skewed towards low values. This can be explained by the very distinctive au-
thoring (in property, editing) patterns of proceedings: they are usually edited
by a larger number of researchers, typically corresponding to the different the-
matic areas included in the conference or symposium. These are often senior
researchers, with a prominent position in their subareas (thus, centrality and
proceeding editorship reinforce each other). Furthermore, the fact that editors
come from different areas contribute to the creation of long-distance links, re-
sulting in a dramatic overall decrease of inter-actor distances.

Although proceeding editorship is certainly a scientiﬁc activity, and con-
stitutes a valuable contribution to the community, putting them at the same
level of research papers is arguable at the very least. It thus seems reasonable
to exclude proceedings from the network to obtain a more unbiased ﬁgure of
centrality. We have done this, obtaining the results shown in Table 3. As it can
be seen, there is now a higher agreement between the two centrality measures
(7/10 are the same, vs. 6/10 before). Furthermore, researchers of unquestion-
able scientiﬁc excellence who were not in the previous ranking do appear now.
For example, Z. Michalewicz, author of several excellent EC books, is now the
author with the highest closeness, the 5th-highest betweeness, and the 7th-
highest number of collaborators. Overall, this may provide a more objective
view on the central actors of our ﬁeld.

5 Discussion and Conclusion

In this paper, we have made a preliminary study of the co-authorship network
in the ﬁeld of evolutionary computation, paving the way to study the impact of
certain measures, such as grants, the establishment of scientiﬁc societies or new
conferences, has on the subject. The general features of the network suggest
that it is quite similar to the ﬁeld it can be better placed, computer science, but,
at the same time, authors are much more closely related with each other. We
have also taken into account the impact co-editorship of proceedings have on
the overall aspect of the network and most centrality measures. To the best of
our knowledge, this issue had not been considered in previous related works,
and we believe it plays an important role in distorting some network proper-
ties. We suggest to not consider them in the future in this kind of studies.

In connection to this latter issue, we believe that co-authorship networks
created by different kind of papers (technical reports, conference papers, jour-
nal papers) might be different owing to the different kind of collaboration
they imply. Consider that while technical reports may be written in a hurry
and present very preliminary results, conference papers are usually somewhat
more long term, and journal papers really indicate a committed scientiﬁc rela-
tionship (due to the long time they take to be published and the several itera-
tions of the revision process). The authors suggest to approach them separately
and analyze the features of the networks they yield.

In addition to this, our future lines of work along this topic will include the
analysis of the network evolution through time, as well as the impact funded
scientiﬁc networks and transnational grants (such as EU grants) have had on it.
We also plan to study the existence of invisible colleges or communities within
the EC ﬁeld, and analyze which their axes of development are, e.g., topical or
regional.

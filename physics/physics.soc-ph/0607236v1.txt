Abstract

Most of parameters used to describe states and dynamics of ﬁnancial market depend on pro-

portions of the appropriate variables rather than on their actual values. Therefore, projective

geometry seems to be the correct language to describe the theater of ﬁnancial activities. We sup-

pose that the object of interest of agents, called here baskets, form a vector space over the reals.

A portfolio is deﬁned as an equivalence class of baskets containing assets in the same proportions.

Therefore portfolios form a projective space. Cross ratios, being invariants of projective maps,

form key structures in the proposed model. Quotation with respect to an asset Ξ (i.e. in units of

Ξ) are given by linear maps. Among various types of metrics that have ﬁnancial interpretation,

the min-max metrics on the space of quotations can be introduced. This metrics has an interesting

interpretation in terms of rates of return. It can be generalized so that to incorporate a new numer-

ical parameter (called temperature) that describes agent’s lack of knowledge about the state of the

market. In a dual way, a metrics on the space of market quotation is deﬁned. In addition, one can

deﬁne an interesting metric structure on the space of portfolios/quotation that is invariant with

respect to hyperbolic (Lorentz) symmetries of the space of portfolios. The introduced formalism

opens new interesting and possibly fruitful ﬁelds of research.

INTRODUCTION

In majority of the models considered in economics one cannot ask questions about sym-

metries of the considered phenomena, especially if one put the stress on group theoretical

aspects. The reason is that one can hardly speak about invariance (covariance) of terms used

in analysis or numerical values returned by most of models [1]. We would like to argue that

projective geometry, equipped with an appropriate metric structure and some measure of

investors performance, might form a precise formalism that allows us to carry out objective

(quantitative) analysis of investment processes and symmetries of their market context. We

describe a simple geometrical model of a ﬁnancial market – we call it Information Theory

Model of Markets (ITMM) – that explores ideas of projective geometry. Our model presents

in some sense a picture of ﬁnancial markets dual to that assumed in the most popular ones,

Capital Asset Pricing Model and Arbitrage Pricing Models [2]. Investors, due to their lack

of knowledge, wrong prognosis for the future or simple fear, behave in an unpredictable,

chaotic way. Prices are determined by their decisions – in the same way as the gas pres-

sure is determined by (chaotic) particles dynamics. A non-random pricing of capital assets

follows from investors knowledge and possible random factors cancel themselves due to va-

riety of strategies adopted by investors if the market is liquid enough. The formalism of

projective geometry allows us to carry out analysis of invariant and covariant quantities. A

detailed axiomatic formulation of the model will be given elsewhere [3], here we would like

to present only some basic features. The paper is organized as follows. In the next section

we give some basic deﬁnitions and describe mathematical tools we are going to use. Then

we show the importance of metric structures and give two exemplary metrics.

It follows

that some important analogies with physical theories can be expected. Finally, we discuss a

possible connection between investors performance and knowledge about markets measured

by information theory means.

II. PROJECTIVE GEOMETRY AS A FORMALISM DESCRIBING INVEST-

MENTS

The market determines what goods are made and what products are bought and sold. We

assume that objects of investors interest span a (N+1)-dimensional vector space G over the

reals. Elements of this vector space are called baskets. Let us ﬁx some basis {g0, g1, . . . , gN}

in G. gµ∈ G, the µ-th element of the basis, is called the µ-th asset (market good). Assets,

although selected in an arbitrary way, are distinguished because they are used for eﬀective

bookkeeping, accounting, market analysis and so on. For any basket p ∈ G we have a unique

representation

X
µ=0
The coeﬃcient pµ∈ R is called the µ-th coordinate of the basket. A portfolio is deﬁned as an
equivalence class of non-empty baskets (that is in G \ {0}) [4]. Two baskets p′ and p′′ are

p =

If for a given portfolio we have pµ 6= 0, then there exists such a basket representing

this portfolio that it contains exactly a unit of asset gµ. Coordinates of this basket,

p = (p0, . . . , pµ−1, 1, pµ+1, . . . , pN ), are called inhomogeneous coordinates of the portfolio p

with respect to µ-th asset. If pµ= 0, p = (p0, . . . , pµ−1, 0, pµ+1, . . . , pN ), then we say that that

the portfolio p is improper for the µ-th asset. Market quotation U in units of ν-th asset is

a linear map U(gν,

(Up)ν = U(gν, p) =

U(gν, gµ)pµ,

where U(gν, gµ) is the price of a unit of µ-th asset given in units of ν-th asset.

A. Basic deﬁnition and ideas

We require that

U(gµ, U(gν, p)gν)gµ = U(gµ, p)gµ

for p and gµ and gν being exchangeable assets (that is U(gµ, gν) 6= 0 and U(gµ, gν) 6= ±∞,

so inserting p = gρ we get

U(gµ, gν)U(gν, gρ) = U(gµ, gρ)

(2)

for any µ, ν, ρ. Therefore quotations are transitive [5]. If we set µ = ν = ρ in (2) then we

see that there are two possibilities U(gµ, gµ) = 1 or U(gµ, gµ) = 0. The case U(gµ, gµ) = 1

implies projectivity of U: U((Up)µgµ)µ = (Up)µ. The case U(gµ, gµ) = 0 means that the

µ-th asset is not subjected to quotation in the market (one can only, for example, present

somebody with such an asset). For µ = ρ we get U(gµ, gµ) = 1 and therefore

U(gµ, gν) =

U(gν, gµ)

−1

.

In general, the quotation map can be represented by a (N+1)×(N+1) matrix with (µ, ν)-th

entry given by Uµν := U(gµ, gν). The simplest way of determining this matrix consist in

selecting some asset that is called the currency. Suppose that the asset g0 is selected as the

currency. The matrix Uµν is deﬁned uniquely by N values uk := U(g0, gk) for k =1, . . . , N.

(Note that U00 = 1). If u0 := 1, due to the transitivity (2) all entries of (Uµν) are determined

by the formula:

Explicitly, we have Eq. (1)

Uµν = u−1

µ uν.

(3)

(Up)ν =

uµpµu−1
ν .

N

µ=0

For uk= 0 Eq. (3) remains valid if we set u−1
k

:= 0. Sometimes we have to rescale the prices

uk in units proportional to g0, ( e.g. if g0 represents shares, after split, after currency denom-

ination and so on). Therefore it is convenient to identify quotations U = (λ, λ u1, . . . , λ uN)
for all λ ∈ R\{0}, that is introduce homogeneous coordinates. We say that the portfolio p is

balanced for the quotation U if there is such an asset gµ, so that the value of p in units of

gµ is 0, that is

(Up)µ =

U(gµ, gν)pν =

uνpνu−1

µ = 0.

For quotation denominated in currency this formula simpliﬁes to

linearity of these equations allows for simple interpretations: portfolio p is balanced if the

III. METRIC STRUCTURES

It is a common lore that price movements are best described by diﬀusion processes. Dif-

fusion equations of various types involve Laplace operator and therefore metric structure.

Metric structures are to some extent independent of the conﬁguration (phase) space struc-

ture. One of our aims is to ﬁnd a suitable metrics on the projective space. Various premises

rooted in ﬁnance theory can be used to select a metric structure on the space of portfolios.

For example, often we would like to know which market movements are equivalent to port-

folio modiﬁcations. Below we describe two classes of metrics that we were able to construct

in an explicit way. Both have interesting physical connotations. There probably is quite a

lot of other interesting metrics yet to be found.

A. Exemplary metric structure

Let us try to deﬁne a metrics on the space of quotations. Two diﬀerent quotations U ′

and U ′′ determine projective prime line. To deﬁne a cross ratio we need two additional

points lying in that line. It seems natural to select them, let us consider two hyperplanes of
improper quotations for two basic assets. These hyperplanes cut the projective space RPN
into 2N N-dimensional simplexes. Suppose that the quotations belong to the same simplex

– only then the distance would be ﬁnite. Each hyperplane of improper quotation for an

asset gµ is cut by the prime line. In this way we select N +1 points but only two of them,
say Pb and Pc, lie in the vicinity of U ′ and U ′′ – and only these two points belong to the
boundary of the simplex that contains U ′ and U ′′, cf Fig. 3. The cross ratio [Pb, U ′, U ′′, Pc]

can be used to deﬁne the distance (metrics):

d(U ′, U ′′) = ln([Pb, U ′, U ′′, Pc]) = ln

|U ′Pc||U ′′Pb|
|U ′Pb||U ′′Pc|

,

where |P1P2| denotes euclidean distance of points P1 and P2. After some tedious but ele-

mentary calculations the metrics can be given in a more transparent form:

d(U ′, U ′′) = ln([Pb, U ′, U ′′, Pc]) = ln

|U ′Pc||U ′′Pb|
|U ′Pb||U ′′Pc|

FIG. 3: Quotation in a three-assets market (RP 2).

The function rµ(U ′, U ′′) is known in ﬁnance as the interval interest rate. We have already

proposed a method that allows us to measure quantitatively investors qualiﬁcations [7].

Inspired by previous results and statistical physics, we can introduce a temperature-like

parameter in the metrics given by Eq.(5). Such a generalized metrics take the following

form:

d(U ′, U ′′, T ) :=

It should be possible to deﬁne canonical ensembles of portfolios, the temperature (entropy)

of portfolios and, possibly, various thermodynamics-like potentials in a way analogous to

that of Ref. [7].

B. Hyperbolic (Lorentz) geometry

We were able to identify another interesting metrics. Consider quotations at two diﬀerent

times t′ and t′′ in a simpliﬁed, two-assets market. Let the homogeneous coordinates are

0,g ˆp′

0,g ˆp′′
ˆp∗′ = (g ˆp′
ˆp∗′ 6= ˆp∗′′. The linear transformation:

1) and ˆp∗′′ = (g ˆp′′

1), respectively. Suppose the quotations are not equal,

ˆS = ˆS(ˆp∗′, ˆp∗′′) :=

changes the basis in such a way that the quotations ˆp∗′ and ˆp∗′′ have coordinates f ˆp′ := (1, −1)
and f ˆp′′ := (1, 1). From the physicist point of view, the directions (1, −1) and (1, 1) deﬁne

the propagation of light in a two-dimensional spacetime. We can accept this directions us

absolute directions (light cone). The underlying metric structure can also be found. In the

dual representation, that is in the space of portfolios, two portfolios balanced on quotations

ˆp∗′ and ˆp∗′′ are inﬁnitely separated. Explicit form of the metrics on the space of portfolios

is as follows:

where

d(p∗′, p∗′′) = | arctan(v′) − arctan(v′′)|,

v(p∗) = v(p∗, ˆp∗′, ˆp∗′′) = gp0(g ˆp′′

change the content of a portfolio only if one ”travels with speed of light” in the market.

C.

Information theory context

The projective geometry structure of clear-cut market model with a metrics that respects

symmetries of the modelled processes should yet be completed by discussion/construction

of algorithms that governs the supply and demand aspects of agents behaviour. These

algorithms should be optimal from the metrical structure point of view and, of course, respect

speciﬁc regulations laid down by authorities. For example, in the simple Merchandising

Mathematician Model [8] and Kelly optimal bets [9] the optimal market strategies have

direct connections with the Boltzmann/Shannon entropy. These examples suggest that

there might be a uniﬁed description of market phenomena that involves tools from geometry,

statistical physics and information theory. And the key ingredients would probably follow

from the underlying metric structure.

IV. CONCLUSIONS: TOWARDS INFORMATION THEORETICAL DESCRIP-

TION OF MARKETS

We have attempted at formulation of kind of Market Symmetry Principle: Conclusions

drawn from a logically complete market model are invariant with respect to projective sym-

metry transformations. We anticipate that metric structures might play a key role that

would pave the way for information theoretical description of market phenomena. This

9

point of view is supported by the explicit examples given in the paper. The presented pro-

jective geometry formalism although simpliﬁed, is, to the best of our knowledge, the only

one that attempts to introduce metric structure to ﬁnance theory models that respect ob-

served market processes symmetries, eg preselected absolute directions. This would allow

for analysis of hyperplanes of equilibrium temperature, entropy, various thermodynamical

potentials, Legendre transforms and, possibly identiﬁcation of conservation laws with tools

borrowed from information theory and (quantum) game theory [10].

[1] An invariant of a process (phenomenon, transformation etc.) is a numerical parameter whose

value remains constant during that process. Analogously, a covariant is a parameter whose

numerical value has only a (relative) sense in a preselected coordinate system but changes in

a speciﬁed way if the coordinate systems is changed (e.g. given by some symmetry transfor-

[5] Note that this means that we treat all taxes, brokerages etc. as liabilities and therefore as

separate assets. Models that have scale eﬀects (projective symmetry is broken) should have a

dual description in terms of nontransitive quotations.

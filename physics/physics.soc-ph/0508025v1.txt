An index to quantify an individual’s scientiﬁc output

J. E. Hirsch

(Dated: April 27, 2012)

I propose the index h, deﬁned as the number of papers with citation number higher or equal to

h, as a useful index to characterize the scientiﬁc output of a researcher.

PACS numbers:

For the few scientists that earn a Nobel prize, the im-
pact and relevance of their research work is unquestion-
able. Among the rest of us, how does one quantify the cu-
mulative impact and relevance of an individual’s scientiﬁc
output? In a world of not unlimited resources such quan-
tiﬁcation (even if potentially distasteful) is often needed
for evaluation and comparison purposes, eg for university
faculty recruitment and advancement, award of grants,
etc.

The publication record of an individual and the ci-
tation record are clearly data that contain useful infor-
mation. That information includes the number (Np) of
papers published over n years, the number of citations
(N j
c ) for each paper (j), the journals where the papers
were published and their impact parameter, etc. This is a
large amount of information that will be evaluated with
diﬀerent criteria by diﬀerent people. Here I would like
to propose a single number, the ”h-index”, as a particu-
larly simple and useful way to characterize the scientiﬁc
output of a researcher.

A scientist has index h if h of his/her Np papers have
at least h citations each, and the other (Np − h) papers
have fewer than h citations each.

In my admittedly incomplete search among physicists
I found E. Witten to have an amazing h = 109. That
is, Witten has written 109 papers with at least 109 cita-
tions each. That gives a lower bound on the total num-
ber of citations to Witten’s papers at h2 = 11, 881. Of
course the total number of citations (Nc,tot) will usually
be much larger than h2, since h2 both underestimates
the total number of citations of the h most cited papers
and ignores the papers with fewer than h citations. The
relation between Nc,tot and h will depend on the detailed
form of the particular distribution[1, 2], and it is useful
to deﬁne the proportionality constant a as

Nc,tot = ah2.

(1)

I ﬁnd empirically that a ranges between 3 and 5.

Other prominent physicists with high h’s are M.L.
Cohen (h = 94), P.W. Anderson (h = 91), M. Car-
dona (h = 86), P.G. deGennes (h = 79), J.N. Bahcall
(h = 77), Z. Fisk (h = 75), D.J. Scalapino (h = 75),
G. Parisi (h = 73), S.G. Louie (h = 70), R. Jackiw
(h = 69), F. Wilczek (h = 68), C. Vafa (h = 66), M.B.
Maple (h = 66), D.J. Gross (h = 66), M.S. Dresselhaus
(h = 62), S.W. Hawking (h = 62).

I argue that h is preferable to other single-number cri-
teria commonly used to evaluate scientiﬁc output of a
researcher, as follows:

(0) Total number of papers (Np): Advantage: mea-
sures productivity. Disadvantage: does not measure im-
portance nor impact of papers.

(1) Total number of citations (Nc,tot): Advantage:
measures total impact. Disadvantage: hard to ﬁnd; may
be inﬂated by a small number of ’big hits’, which may
not be representative of the individual if he/she is coau-
thor with many others on those papers.
In such cases
the relation Eq. (1) will imply a very atypical value of a,
larger than 5. Another disadvantage is that Nc,tot gives
undue weight to highly cited review articles versus origi-
nal research contributions.

(2) Citations per paper, i.e. ratio of Nc,tot to Np: Ad-
vantage: allows comparison of scientists of diﬀerent ages.
Disadvantage: hard to ﬁnd; rewards low productivity,
penalizes high productivity.

(3) Number of ’signiﬁcant papers’, deﬁned as the num-
ber of papers with more than y citations, for example
y = 50. Advantage: eliminates the disadvantages of cri-
teria (0), (1), (2), gives an idea of broad and sustained
impact. Disadvantage: y is arbitrary and will randomly
favor or disfavor individuals; y needs to be adjusted for
diﬀerent levels of seniority.

(4) Number of citations to each of the q most cited
papers, for example q = 5. Advantage: overcomes many
of the disadvantages of the criteria above. Disadvantage:
it is not a single number, making it more diﬃcult to ob-
tain and compare. Also, q is arbitrary and will randomly
favor and disfavor individuals.

Instead, the proposed h-index measures the broad im-
pact of an individual’s work; it avoids all the disadvan-
tages of the criteria listed above; it usually can be found
very easily, by ordering papers by ’times cited’ in the ISI
database; it gives a ballpark estimate of the total number
of citations, Eq. (1).

Thus I argue that two individuals with similar h are
comparable in terms of their overall scientiﬁc impact,
even if their total number of papers or their total number
of citations is very diﬀerent. Conversely, that between
two individuals (of the same scientiﬁc age) with similar
number of total papers or of total citation count and very
diﬀerent h-values, the one with the higher h is likely to
be the ’better’ scientist.

For a given individual one expects that h should in-

crease approximately linearly with time. In the simplest
possible model, assume the researcher publishes p papers
per year and each published paper earns c new citations
per year every subsequent year. The total number of
citations after n + 1 years is then

Nc,tot =

pcj =

pcn(n + 1)

Assuming all papers up to year y contribute to the index

hence

The total number of citations (for not too small n) is
then approximately

Nc,tot ∼

(1 + c/p)2
2c/p

h2

of the form Eq. (1). The coeﬃcient a depends on the
number of papers and the number of citations per paper
earned per year as given by eq. (5). As stated earlier we
ﬁnd empirically that a ∼ 3 to 5 are typical values. The
linear relation

h ∼ mn

(6)

should hold quite generally for scientists that produce pa-
pers of similar quality at a steady rate over the course of
their careers, of course m will vary widely among diﬀer-
ent researchers. In the simple linear model, m is related
to c and p as given by eq. (4). Quite generally, the slope
of h versus n, the parameter m, should provide a useful
yardstick to compare scientists of diﬀerent seniority.

In the linear model, the minimum value of a in Eq.
(1) is a = 2, for the case c = p, where the papers with
more than h citations and those with less than h citations
contribute equally to the total Nc,tot. The value of a
will be larger for both c > p and c < p. For c > p,
most contributions to the total number of citations arise
from the ’highly cited papers’ (the h papers that have
Nc > h), while for c < p it is the sparsely cited papers
(the Np − h papers that have fewer than h citations each)
that give the largest contribution to Nc,tot. We ﬁnd that
the ﬁrst situation holds in the vast majority, if not all,
cases. For the linear model deﬁned in this example, a = 4
corresponds to c/p = 5.83 (the other value that yields
a = 4, c/p = 0.17, is unrealistic).

The linear model deﬁned above corresponds to the dis-

tribution

                              h            paper number

FIG. 1: The intersection of the 45 degree line with the curve
giving the number of citations versus the paper number gives
h. The total number of citations is the area under the curve.
Assuming the second derivative is non-negative everywhere,
the minimum area is given by the distribution indicated by
the dotted line, yielding a=2 in Eq. 1.

where Nc(y) is the number of citations to the y-th paper
(ordered from most to least cited), and N0 is the number
of citations of the most highly cited paper (N0 = cn in
the example above). The total number of papers ym is
given by Nc(ym) = 0, hence

We can write N0 and ym in terms of a deﬁned in Eq. (1)
as :

ym =

N0h
N0 − h

N0 = h[a ±

a2 − 2a]

ym = h[a ∓

a2 − 2a]

p

p

For a = 2, N0 = ym = 2h. For larger a, the upper sign
in Eq. (9) corresponds to the case where the highly cited
papers dominate (more realistic case) and the lower sign
where the low-cited papers dominate the total citation
count.

In a more realistic model, Nc(y) will not be a linear
function of y. Note that a = 2 can safely be assumed to
be a lower bound quite generally, since a smaller value
of a would require the second derivative ∂2Nc/∂y2 to be
negative over large regions of y which is not realistic. The
total number of citations is given by the area under the
Nc(y) curve, that passes through the point Nc(h) = h.
In the linear model the lowest a = 2 corresponds to the
line of slope −1, as shown in Figure 1.

A more realistic model would be a stretched exponen-

tial of the form

Nc(y) = N0e

Nc(y) = N0 − (

Note that for β ≤ 1, N ′′
c (y) > 0 for all y, hence a > 2 is
true. We can write the distribution in terms of h and a

(11)

(12)

(13)

(14)

and the total number of papers (with at least one cita-
tion) is determined by N (ym) = 1 as

ym = h[1 + αβ ln(h)]1/β

(15)

A given researcher’s distribution can be modeled by
choosing the most appropriate β and a for that case. For
example, for β = 1, if a = 3, α = 0.661 and N0 = 4.54h,
ym = h[1 + .66lnh]. With a = 4, α = 0.4644, N0 = 8.61h
and ym = h[1 + 0.46ln(h)]. For β = 0.5, the lowest
possible value of a is 3.70; for that case, N0 = 7.4h,
ym = h[1 + 0.5ln(h)]2. Larger a values will increase N0
and reduce ym. For β = 2/3, the smallest possible a is
a = 3.24, for which case N0 = 4.5h and ym = h[1 +
0.66ln(h)]3/2.

The linear relation between h and n Eq. (6) will of
course break down when the researcher slows down in pa-
per production or stops publishing altogether. There is a
time lag between the two events. In the linear model as-
suming the researcher stops publishing after nstop years,
h continues to increase at the same rate for a time

nlag =

=

h
c

1 + c/p

nstop

(16)

and then stays constant, since now all published papers
contribute to h. In a more realistic model h will smoothly
level oﬀ as n increases rather than with a discontinuous
change in slope. Still quite generally the time lag will be
larger for scientists who have published for many years
as Eq. (16) indicates.

Furthermore in reality of course not all papers will
eventually contribute to h. Some papers with low cita-
tions will never contribute to a researcher’s h, especially
if written late in the career when h is already appreciable.
As discussed by Redner[3], most papers earn their cita-
tions over a limited period of popularity and then they
are no longer cited. Hence it will be the case that pa-
pers that contributed to a researcher’s h early in his/her
career will no longer contribute to h later in the individ-
ual’s career. Nevertheless it is of course always true that
h cannot decrease with time. The paper or papers that

3

at any given time have exactly h citations are at risk of
being eliminated from the individual’s h-count as they
are superseded by other papers that are being cited at a
higher rate. It is also possible that papers ’drop out’ and
then later come back into the h-count, as would occur for
the kind of papers termed ’sleeping beauties’[4].

For the individual researchers mentioned earlier I ﬁnd n
from the time elapsed since their ﬁrst published paper till
the present, and ﬁnd the following values for the slope m
deﬁned in Eq. (6): Witten, m = 3.89; Cohen, m = 2.24;
Anderson, m = 1.88; Cardona, m = 1.87; deGennes,
m = 1.75; Bahcall, m = 1.75; Fisk, m = 2.14; Scalapino,
m = 1.88; Parisi, m = 2.15; Louie, m = 2.33; Jackiw,
m = 1.92; Wilczek, m = 2.19; Vafa, m = 3.30; Maple,
m = 1.94; Gross, m = 1.69; Dresselhaus, m = 1.41;
Hawking, m = 1.59. From inspection of the citation
records of many physicists I conclude:

(1) A value m ∼ 1, i.e. an h index of 20 after 20 years
of scientiﬁc activity, characterizes a successful scientist.
(2) A value m ∼ 2, i.e. an h-index of 40 after 20 years
of scientiﬁc activity, characterizes outstanding scientists,
likely to be found only at the top universities or major
research laboratories.

(3) A value m ∼ 3 or higher, i.e. an h-index of 60 after
20 years, or 90 after 30 years, characterizes truly unique
individuals.

The m-parameter ceases to be useful if a scientist does
not maintain his/her level of productivity, while the h-
parameter remains useful as a measure of cumulative
achievement that may continue to increase over time even
long after the scientist has stopped publishing altogether.
Based on typical h and m values found, I suggest that
(with large error bars) for faculty at research universi-
ties h ∼ 12 should be a typical value for advancement
to tenure (associate professor), and h ∼ 18 for advance-
ment to full professor. Fellowship in the American Phys-
ical Society should occur typically for h ∼ 15 to 20. In
the University of California system where advancement
to full professor step VI is associated with ’great dis-
tinction’ h ∼ 30 seems appropriate, and advancement to
’distinguished professor’ (beyond step IX) requiring re-
search ’internationally recognized and acclaimed’, h of
order 45. Membership in the US National Academy of
Sciences should typically be associated with h ∼ 45 and
higher except in exceptional circumstances. Note that
these estimates correspond roughly to typical number
of years of sustained research production assuming an
m ∼ 1 value, the time scales of course will be shorter
for scientists with higher m values. Note that the time
estimates are taken from the publication of the ﬁrst pa-
per which typically occurs some years before the Ph.D.
is earned.

As an interesting sample population I computed h and
m for the physicists that obtained Nobel prizes in the
last 20 years (for calculating m I used the latter of the
ﬁrst published paper year or 1955, the ﬁrst year in the
ISI database). However the set was further restricted
by including only the names that uniquely identiﬁed the

scientist in the ISI citation index. This restricted our
set to 76% of the total, it is however still an unbiased
estimator since the commonality of the name should be
uncorrelated with h and m. h-indices range from 22 to
79, m-indices from 0.47 to 2.19. Averages and standard
deviations are < h >= 41, σh = 15, and < m >= 1.14,
σm = 0.47. The distribution of h-indices is shown in Fig-
ure 2, the median is at hm = 35, lower than the mean due

4

to the tail for high h values. It is interesting that Nobel
prize winners have substantial h indices (84% had h of at
least 30), indicating that Nobel prizes do not originate
in one stroke of luck but in a body of scientiﬁc work.
Notably the values of m found are often not high com-
pared to other successful scientists (49% of our sample
had m < 1). This is clearly because Nobel prizes are
often awarded long after the period of maximum produc-
tivity of the researchers.

As another example, among newly elected members in
the National Academy of Sciences in Physics and Astron-
omy in 2005 I ﬁnd < h >= 44, σh = 14, highest h = 71,
lowest h = 20. Among the total membership in NAS in
Physics the subgroup of last names starting with A and
B has < h >= 38, σh = 10. These examples further indi-
cate that the index h is a stable and consistent estimator
of scientiﬁc achievement.

In summary, I have proposed an easily computable in-
dex, h, which gives an estimate of the importance, sig-
niﬁcance and broad impact of a scientist’s cumulative
research contributions. I suggest that this index should
provide a useful yardstick to compare diﬀerent individu-
als competing for the same resource when an important
evaluation criterion is scientiﬁc achievement, in an unbi-
ased way.

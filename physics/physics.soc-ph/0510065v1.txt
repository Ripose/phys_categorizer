Abstract

The dynamical process of opinion formation within a model using a local majority opinion

updating rule is studied numerically in networks with the small-world geometrical property. The

network is one in which shortcuts are added to randomly chosen pairs of nodes in an underlying

regular lattice. The presence of a small number of shortcuts is found to shorten the time to reach

a consensus signiﬁcantly. The eﬀects of having shortcuts in a lattice of ﬁxed spatial dimension

are shown to be analogous to that of increasing the spatial dimension in regular lattices. The

shortening of the consensus time is shown to be related to the shortening of the mean shortest

path as shortcuts are added. Results can also be translated into that of the dynamics of a spin

system in a small-world network.

INTRODUCTION

The physics of networks has received much attention in recent years. Topologically, a

network consists of nodes and links, with the latter connecting the nodes in some fashion.

Traditionally, the network models studied in many branches of science are the regular lattices

and the random networks (classical random graphs) [1].

It was not until the late 1990’s

that scientists, many of them physicists, discovered that many real-world networks exhibit

geometrical properties that are diﬀerent from regular networks and random graphs [2, 3, 4,

5, 6]. Among these properties are: (i) A small average distance between arbitrarily chosen

nodes in the network, i.e., each node may reach another node through a path the only passes

through a few other nodes. This is the so-called small-world eﬀect. Typically, the average

distance increases with the number of nodes in the network only logarithmically. (ii) The

clustering coeﬃcient, which characterizes the extent in which the connected neighbors of a

node are also connected, in real-world networks is relatively high. In the context of a society

of individuals, these properties imply that one can approach any individual through a few

intermediate connections, and the friends of a person are likely to be friends of each other.

An important branch of research in networks deals with the eﬀects of the geometrical

properties of networks on dynamical processes in networks. Taking the nodes as individuals,

such dynamical processes may be epidemics in a population, cultural assimilation, opinion

formation, voting or election, decision making on competing for limited resources [7, 8, 9,

10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. An important question is to see how networking eﬀects may aﬀect

the ﬁnal state of a dynamical process and the time of reaching the ﬁnal state. In the present

work, we study the dynamical process of opinion formation based on a recent model of

Redner and coworkers [9, 10] in which the dynamics is based on a local majority rule [16].

Although the model was original stated in terms of spins (nodes) that can take on one of two

possible states, we will instead describe the model in terms of opinion formation between

agents (nodes) who can take on one of two opinions. The translation from one description

to another is obvious. The local majority rule then describes the inﬂuence of neighboring

(connected) agents on an agent’s opinion. In particular, we will study the changes in the

dynamical process as a regular lattice is transformed into a small-world network by adding

links to connect randomly chosen pairs of nodes [17]. This model of small-world network is

analogous to that of Watts and Strogatz [18], and this underlying network has been used

2

to investigate voting processes [11, 12] and the Ising model [19]. We found that the time

to reach a consensus drops sensitively with the additional of a small fraction of links to an

otherwise regular lattice. The additional of links in a lattice of ﬁxed spatial dimension is

found to have similar eﬀects as increasing the spatial dimensionality of a regular lattice and

to bring the system closer to the mean ﬁeld results previously obtained in the literature

[9, 10]. We also explore the correlation between the change in the time to reach a consensus

and the mean shortest distance of the underlying network.

The plan of the paper is as follows. We introduce the model of opinion formation and

the underlying network structure in Sec.II. Results of detailed simulations are presented and

discussed in Sec.III. A summary of the results is given in Sec.IV.

II. OPINION FORMATION MODEL AND NETWORK STRUCTURE

We consider a system with N nodes, which may, for example, represent N agents or N

magnetic moments or spins depending on the situation under consideration. For each node,

there are two possible states which are represented by +1 and

1. These states represent

−

two opposite opinions. Following the model studied by Redner and co-workers [9, 10], the

states of the nodes evolve in time according to the following updating rules. At each time

step, one node is chosen randomly. The chosen node and his connected neighbors through

an underlying network are then considered collectively for updating. For hypercubic lattices

in D-dimension, for example, the cluster size is (2D + 1) nodes since each node is connected

to 2D nearest neighboring nodes. All the nodes in the cluster of nodes will then be updated

to take on the state of the local majority. The updating rule thus represents a consensus is

reached in a cluster by taking the majority opinion. The procedure is then repeated until

all the nodes reach a common state, i.e., when a ﬁnal state of consensus is reached.

Previous studies [9, 10] on the model were carried out on regular lattices. Recent research

on the science of networks reveals that many real-world networks exhibit the small-world

eﬀect. The eﬀect refers to the shortest distance from one node to another in networks.

In contrast, the distance in a regular lattice grows with the size of the lattice. To study

the eﬀects of shortening of distances on opinion formation, we choose a lattice proposed

by Newman and Watts [17] in which one may study the eﬀects of a gradual change in the

distance as links are randomly added to an underlying regular lattice. We start with a

3

two-dimensional (2D) square lattice of size √N

√N with periodic boundary conditions.

×

A number of additional links, called “shortcuts”, are added between a randomly chosen pair

of nodes. Slight modiﬁcations to the model in Ref.[17] are that the shortcuts cannot link

a node to itself and at most one link is allowed between any two nodes, i.e., no doubly

connected nodes. To quantify the number of additional links on the lattice, we introduce a

parameter q, which is the number of additional links normalized by the total number of links

2N in the underlying lattice. For given q, the number of additional links is 2qN. Note that

in changing a square lattice into a fully connected network without doubly connected nodes,

a total of N(N

5)/2 additional links are needed. For given q, the corresponding fraction of

−

all possible additional links is, therefore, given by 4q/(N

5). From our numerical results,

we found that additional links amount to q

1 are suﬃcient for studying the networking

−

≈

eﬀects in the dynamics of opinion formation. Thus, we will focus in the range 0

in the following discussions. To allow for comparison with results on regular lattices, we

randomly choose 2D neighbors among the neighbors of the chosen site for updating in each

1

q <
∼

≤

time step. We have checked that using the whole cluster of a chosen site for updating give

nearly identical results.

III. RESULTS

A. Shortening of consensus time

An important quantity for opinion formation is the consensus time, which is the time for

the system to reach a common opinion. Starting with an initial conﬁguration of a fraction

p of +1 and a fraction of (1

p) of

1 states among the nodes, the time to reach consensus

−

−

is studied numerically. Figure 1(a) gives the results of the mean consensus time T in a 2D

lattice with diﬀerent numbers of shortcuts in units of Monte Carlo step per site, i.e., one such

time step corresponds to the time during which each node would have been updated once

on average. Results are obtained by averaging 5000 runs with diﬀerent initial conﬁgurations

for given values of p and q. The q = 0 results corresponding to that on a square lattice.

The results show that as a small number (q < 1) of shortcuts are added, the consensus

time drops sensitivity for nearly the whole range of p. For a small range near p

0 and

≈

1, additional links may lead to a slightly longer consensus time, but just by a tiny bit,

p

≈

4

as a result of possible re-enforcement of the survival of some scattered minority states by

the additional links. In our model, we have chosen to ﬁx the updating cluster size to be

(2D + 1), where D is the dimension of the underlying regular lattice. It will be interesting

to check the results against those in which the chosen node is updated together with all its

connected nodes. Figure 1(b) shows the results for such a model, with the normalization to

the simulation time steps taken to be (
h

k

i

k

h

i

+ 1), where

is the mean degree of the network

after the shortcuts are added. The results of the two models are nearly identical. The

reason is that the degree distribution of the network with added links, unlike the scale-free

networks [20], has a sharp and characteristic peak. The drop in the consensus time is most

sensitive in the intermediate range of p. For p

0.5, a drop of consensus time of two orders

≈

of magnitude can be achieved by the addition of about N links to the system (q = 0.5)

(see Fig.1(a)). Interestingly, recent studies on the dynamics of voter models [11, 12] in 1D

small-world networks revealed that ordering processes become harder to achieve with the

addition of shortcuts. The ordering processes in Ising model was also found to be slower

[19] in small-world networks. For the majority updating rule studied here, the shortcuts

accelerates the ordering process of reaching a common opinion.

The sensitivity of the consensus time to q may be a result of a qualitative change in the

time dependence of the dynamics. We studied in detail how the number of nodes with +1

state changes as a function of time for various values of p. Figure 2 shows the results for

p = 0.3, which are typical of the intermediate range of p. For p = 0.3 in a 2D lattice with

N = 2500 nodes, the ﬁnal consensus state has all the nodes with

1 state. The fraction n+

−

of nodes taking on +1 state therefore drops as a function of time. For ﬁnite q, the drop in

n+ is much more rapid than q = 0 and takes on an exponential decaying behavior. We have

checked that similar q-dependence of n+(t) results in underlying lattice of higher spatial

dimensions.

B. Shortcuts and mean ﬁeld limit

To further explore the eﬀects of the shortcuts, we recall that in Ref.[9] a mean ﬁeld limit

of the opinion formation model was studied. The mean ﬁeld limit corresponds to a model in

which at each time step, a group of G nodes are chosen at random among all the N nodes

in the network for updating. The underlying network can thus be thought of one in which

5

every node is possibly connected to another. In Ref.[9], the authors compared simulations

results in 1D, 2D, 3D, and 4D lattices without shortcuts and found that the behavior tends

to approach the mean ﬁeld limit as dimensionality increases. They found that the mean

ﬁeld behavior has not been reached in 4D and thus a higher upper critical dimension is

expected for the problem. Figure 3 shows the exit probability, which is the probability that

the ﬁnal state of the system is one with all the nodes taking on +1 state, as a function of

p for 1D and 2D underlying lattices with added shortcuts. The inset shows the results of

2D networks. The q = 1 results overlap with the mean ﬁeld results, which are obtained by

numerical simulations by randomly choosing groups of G = 5 nodes for updating in every

time step. Analytically, the exit probability takes on the form of an error function [9]. Our

results, therefore, indicate that the eﬀects of q in a lattice with ﬁxed spatial dimension are

similar to that of increasing dimensionality in regular lattices, i.e., increasing q has the eﬀect

of bringing the system closer to the mean ﬁeld limit. To explore this eﬀect more carefully,

Fig.3 (main panel) shows the results in a 1D network with 100 nodes for diﬀerent values

of q, together with results of the mean ﬁeld limit. The updating group size is 3 for each

time step. It is clear from the results that as q increases, the exit probability changes more

abruptly near p = 0.5 and the results approach the mean ﬁeld results.

The consensus time varies in diﬀerent realizations corresponding to given values of q and

p. The consensus time distribution for the q = 0 (no added links) case consists of a mean

peak and a long tail. The latter corresponds to runs in which clusters of minority states

are formed so that a longer time is needed to change the minority opinion of the clusters.

We deﬁne the most probable consensus time Tmp as the time corresponding to the peak of

the distribution [9]. For diﬀerent values of q, we studied the distribution and obtained Tmp

for networks of diﬀerent sizes N. It is also observed that for q slightly larger than zero, the

tail in the consensus time distribution shrinks rapidly, and hence the mean consensus time

and Tmp become closer in value for ﬁnite q. Figure 4 shows the results of Tmp as a function

of N for diﬀerent values of q in a log-log plot, together with the results in the mean ﬁeld

limit [9]. The q = 0 results reproduce the behavior reported in Ref.[9], with Tmp

N α and

∼

α = 1.11

0.01. As q increases, the values of α decreases. The trend of decreasing α has

±

been reported for regular lattices as dimensionality increases [9]. It was reported the mean

ﬁeld limit has not been reached in 4D regular lattices. In contrast, we found that even a

small value of q = 1 leads to a value of α quite close to the mean ﬁeld limit.

6

C. Consensus time and shortest distance

The mean ﬁeld limit corresponds to networks with easy access from one node to another.

The eﬀects of adding links to a regular lattice lead to a similar eﬀect in that the distances

between nodes drop rapidly with the number of added links [17], thus leading to the small-
world eﬀect. This eﬀect is illustrated in Fig.5(a) by showing the drop in L′ = L/lnN as a

function of q for lattices of N = 3600 and N = 10000 nodes, where L is the mean shortest

distance of the network obtained by averaging the shortest distances between all pairs of

nodes in the network. Besides a lnN dependence, L drops with q. It is then interesting

to correlate the mean consensus time and the shortest distance for a given value of q. In
Fig.5(b), the dependence of the mean consensus time T ′ = T /(NlnN) on q is shown for

two values of N, for the case of p = 0.5. Dividing the mean consensus time T by NlnN
removes the N dependence and only q dependence remains. Note that both L′ and T ′ show

similar dependence on q. To illustrate that the shortening of the mean consensus time is

intrinsically a result of the shortening of the shortest distance when shortcuts are added, we
plot T ′ as a function of L′ in Fig.5(c). The data for small L′ correspond to that of q >
∼
We see that T ′ increases monotonically with L′.

IV. SUMMARY

We have studied the eﬀects of adding shortcuts connecting randomly chosen pairs of sites

in a regular lattice on the consensus time in reaching a common opinion within a model

of local majority updating rule. The consensus time is found to drop sensitively with the

addition of a small number of shortcuts. This drop is observed nearly over the whole range

of p characterizing the initial distribution of opinions among the nodes. The rapid drop of

consensus time with the addition of shortcuts is shown to be related to a qualitative change

for ﬁnite q in the time dependence of the drop of the number of minority nodes as a function

of time, as compared with regular lattice without shortcuts. We also compared our results

with mean ﬁeld results previously reported in the literature. It is found that the addition

of shortcuts in a lattice of ﬁxed spatial dimension has the similar eﬀects of increasing the

spatial dimension of regular lattices. This similarity is shown in both the behavior of the

exit probability and the dependence of the most probable consensus time on the network

7

size. Geometrically, the shortcuts decreases the mean shortest distance in a network and

leads to the small-world eﬀect. Dynamically, these shortcuts bring in the opinion of more

connected nodes to a chosen node and hence have the eﬀects of dissolving local minority

groups more rapidly. The consensus time is found to change monotonically with the shortest

distance in the network.

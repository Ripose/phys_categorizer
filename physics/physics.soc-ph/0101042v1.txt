Combustion reaction kinetics models are used for the description of a special class of bursty
Financial Time Series. The small number of parameters they depend upon enable ﬁnancial analysts
to predict the time as well as the magnitude of the jump of the value of the portfolio. Several
Financial Time Series are analysed within this framework and applications are given.

INTRODUCTION

ity lasting for a comparatively long time before the burst.

Stock exchange behavior is traditionally analysed with
Statistical tools (Descriptive statistics, Time-series...)
and more recently with models derived from High-
Energy physics or Statistical Physics. The importance
of ﬁnancial stakes suﬃces to justify interest in these new
methods.

Moreover, any possible analogy that might be drawn
with Cooperative physical phenomena involving a large
number of degrees of freedom is favourably welcome
in the burgeoning ﬁeld of Financial Physics.
The
unambiguous identiﬁcation of the precursory patterns or
aftershock signatures of the market are some of the very
important questions to deal with. It is noted, however,
that the US market is the favourite candidate analysed
in detail so far in the literature and a deeper study of
the European market scene is lacking, in particular, the
analysis of individual stock behavior.

In some cases, the stock trend is easy to guess,
however the largest value its rate might attain is very
diﬃcult to predict, because of the interplay of many
parameters drawn from political or economical interests.

Obviously, the estimation of this ﬁgure is absolutely
essential for investors and any prediction tool in this
ﬁeld provides a leading edge to business people who are
constantly tapping the market searching for opportuni-
ties of growth and proﬁt.

We treat this problem by exploiting an analogy
with combustion models occurring in Physics and
Engineering. Surprisingly, the application of combustion
theory to stocks picked from various economical and
manufacturing sectors leads to very realistic estimations
close to current trading values.

In order to build a framework for our work, we de-
scribe a special class of Financial Time Series (FTS) that
display bursty behaviour at some instant of time with a
large jump with respect to a prior stable level of activ-

The interest in this behaviour for Market Analysts and
Financial Companies is to be able to predict both the
time at which the value jumps as well as the amplitude
of the jump in order to assess the magnitude of beneﬁt
or loss in spite of a stable level of activity for some
time. The ability to detect such behaviour provides a
new speculation tool for gauging the potential of some
companies and possibly predict the maximum amplitude
of their growth in the near or far future.

Models borrowed from Combustion theory display
spectacular behaviour of that sort with a very low
pre-ignition state for a long time followed by a surprising
explosion. The resulting behaviour looks dramatically
like the FTS we are interested in. These Deterministic
models are based on the assumption that some chemical
concentration behaves as a disturbance of the combus-
tion kinetics and is responsible for the sudden explosion
with a long somehow latent pre-ignition state.

This modeling can cope with upward or downward
bursts with the proviso of a prior stable activity for
a while before the burst. For instance, our approach
cannot cope with situations like the recent crisis of the
NASDAQ [1]. Market shares and startup companies
belonging to the ”New Economy” belong to a diﬀerent
class of FTS and their analysis is suggested by Time
series analysis along the lines of the work of Johansen
and Sornette [1] by Stochastic Ito Calculus [5] or with
Statistical/Field Theory techniques. Nevertheless, our
Deterministic approach embodies patterns of behaviuor
that are akin to what is observed in Cooperative phe-
nomena based modelling.

This paper is organised according to the following: In
the next section, we describe a set of Combustion mod-
els that display bursty behaviour with a previously long
pre-ignition state. We extend these models to downward
explosive models and discuss the features of these models.
In section 3, we discuss the optimisation procedure and
the objective function that will allow us to predict the

burst time and magnitude of the explosion of the FTS.
Section 4 reports on the application of these models to
actual ﬁnancial series and section 5 contains a discussion
of the results with our conclusion.

COMBUSTION MODELS

We consider a simple combustion model described by
the concentration of a chemical y(t) that obeys the non-
linear evolution equation:

dy
dt

= y2(1 − y)

The initial concentration y(0) = ǫ.

This diﬀerential equation can be analytically inte-

grated as:

ln(

y
1 − y

1
y

) −

= t + C

where C = ln( ǫ

1−ǫ ) − 1

ǫ is a constant deﬁned from the

initial condition.

The time t∗ at which the value jumps is deﬁned as the

time the curvature of y(t) changes sign, i.e:

∗

t

= ln(2) − 3/2 − ln(

ǫ
1 − ǫ

) +

1
ǫ

This shows the jump time is on the order of 1

ǫ whereas
the width of the transition region around the jump is
deﬁned by:

∆ = ln(

y2(1 − y1)
y1(1 − y2)

) + (

1
y1

−

1
y2

)

with y1 and y2 are the values deﬁning the transi-
tion region around t∗. We relate these coordinates to ǫ
through: y1 = φ1ǫ and y2 = 1 − φ2ǫ with the constraint:
φ1 + φ2 ≤ 1
ǫ

These expressions show that for an initial value ǫ and
in the simple symmetric case φ1 = φ2 = φ, the width of
the transition region is given by:

∆ = 2ln(

1 − φǫ
φǫ

) +

1
φǫ

−

1 − φǫ

(5)

This model is dubbed a Singular perturbation problem
[2] since decreasing ǫ induces a divergence of both t∗ and
∆. An example of the behaviour of y(t) is depicted in
ﬁg. 1 where ǫ = 10−3.

The down burst model is described by the diﬀerential

equation:

where the constant C, the burst time t∗ and the tran-
sition width are exactly the same as the previous case if
we redeﬁne the values of y1 and y2 in a symmetric fashion
as: y1 = 1 − φǫ and y2 = φǫ. The obtained time series
for ǫ = 10−2 is depicted in ﬁg. 2.

OPTIMISATION PROCEDURE

The parameter space consists of three variables: ǫ, φ
and δt the adaptive unit of time. The reason for the
existence of the additional parameter δt is that we have
to ﬁnd simulaneously the best transition time and ratio
∆
t∗ for the FTS.

The optimization procedure consists of deﬁning an
objective function and ﬁnding its minimum in the
four-dimensional parameter space ǫ, δt, φ1, φ2.
The
objective function is based on a least mean squares ap-
proximation of the diﬀerence between the FTS and the
Combustion model deﬁned as a functional F [ǫ, δt, φ1, φ2].

The optimization program itself is based on a globally
convergent method for solving non-linear system of

equations: the multidimensional secant method devel-
oped by Broyden [4]. It is based on a fast and accurate
method for the iterative evaluation of the Jacobian of
the objective function needed during the minimisation
procedure.
It is a Quasi-Newton method that consists
of approximating the Jacobian and updating it with an
iterative procedure.
It converges superlinearly to the
solution like all secant methods.

In order to run the Optimisation, we tried several

strategies based on the following observations:

1. The diﬀerential equation can be integrated by start-
ing for several trial values of epsilon and the results
for t∗ and the ratio ∆
t∗ stored and interpolated in
order to speed up the Optimisation procedure.

2. The analytical solution can be used in order to
build the objective function explicitly, however this
is valid only in certain cases and with the inversion
of the roles of y and t enforced by the implicit re-
lation between them (see e.g. equation 7).

3. The parameter space being four dimensional was
reduced in some cases to two dimensions by ﬁxing
the values of the parameters φ1 and φ2 on the basis
of statistical grounds.

All the above operations should yield roughly the
same values for the parameters before running the ﬁnal
check in order to test the accuracy of the ﬁtting to the
FTS at hand. Once the ﬁtting is validated a prediction
for the largest magnitude of the plateau value can be
made and compared whenever possible to the available
data.

RESULTS

We have studied the PPS evolution of several compa-
nies over a period ranging from one to ﬁve years. These
were chosen from diﬀerent industrial and economic
sectors with a variety of total market capitalizations.
During the same period, the Paris CAC 40 index grew
regularly and steadily except for the July-November
1998 period.

These trading shares were chosen because of their
peculiar behaviour of underperforming the CAC 40
index over a period of one to ﬁve years with a growth
rate that is weaker than other shares pertaining to
Some of the shares are Alcatel,
the same sector.
GFI, STMicroelectronics belonging to the TMT sector
(Technology, Media and Telecommunications) whereas
DMC, Rochette and Suez belong to traditional economy
sectors. In the Suez case we extended the study to seven
years.

For illustration, we review the cases of these companies
one by one highlighting the validity of the associated
combustion model while giving some historical perspec-
tive in order to provide a background interpretation of
the model parameters.

Starting with Alcatel, its price per share (PPS) started
rising, after a stable period of ﬁve years despite a strong
dip in November 1997 following the withdrawal of the
American Pension Funds. The beginning of the growth
period spans a period of 2 years with a PPS start value
trading around 20 Euros and a upper value of 90 Euros
representing 450 % growth. The combustion model pre-
dicts an upper value of the PPS trading around 80 Euros
which is an estimation below the actual rate by about
12% (see ﬁg. 3).

Next is DMC, a textile company that went through
diﬃcult times with a serious drop of its PPS due to a
overwhelmingly hostile economic situation. It managed
to stabilise its PPS to trade it at 4 to 5 Euros at the
end of 1998. Ultimately it underwent restructuring and
recentered its activities around Sportswear and Creative
Leisure cutting down on less proﬁtable activities. That
action sent a strong signal to stock brokers, investors and
ﬁnanciers. Its PPS grew 450 % in less than 2 months to
reach a trading value of about 20 Euros. In this case, the
combustion model overestimates the actual value by 15
% as displayed in 4.

GFI Informatique is a computer services company be-
longing to the TMT sector with obviously a total market
capitalisation volume much smaller than Alcatel’s. Af-
ter making its entry on the TMT market in 1998, its
PPS started growing steadily slowly at ﬁrst then faster
around August 1999 due to the interest at that time in

TMT companies and excellent prospective growth poten-
tial of GFI. The PPS traded 60 Euros at the beginning
of the year 2000 reaching a growth rate of 600 %. The
value predicted by the Combustion model is 60 Euros in
perfect agreement with the actual value (see ﬁg. 5).

Rochette is a traditional Pulp and Paper company with
a PPS that suﬀered more than 25 % slip during the gen-
eral slowdown period of the year 1998 second semester.
Its PPS stayed constant for nearly a year trading around
2.5 Euros. At the end of 1999, it grew to 7.7 Euros in
good agreement with the suggested Combustion model
(see ﬁg. 6).

The PPS of STMicroelectronics, a company dealing
with the design and testing of Semiconductor Compo-
nents had a stable history until the end of 1998. It ex-

ploited fully the development of the High Technology sec-
tor and it rose to 70 Euros and that is equivalent to a 700
% progress as predicted by the Combustion model (see
ﬁg. 7).

The ﬁnal study case is about Suez. Initially, Suez is a
company geared toward Energy and Water resources dis-
tribution; it extended its activity to Telecommunications
around 1996 merging with Lyonnaise des Eaux in June
1997. That event triggered a 230 % growth rate in its
PPS rising from 75 Euros to 175 Euros. Again, this is in
with perfect agreement with the suggested combustion
model (see ﬁg. 8). The long term stability of the PPS
pushed us in this case to extend the study period to over
seven years.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

The combustion model

is a faithful description of
the FTS we considered and can be used to predict
the PPS over some deﬁnite period of time ahead.
Is
is deterministic and describes features that requires
usually the mathematics and techniques of Cooperative
physical phenomena. We stress that our study is based
on actual PPS time series and not on synthetic data and
that it analyses individual PPS rather than composite
data that might contain averaging eﬀects.

The special class of FTS we consider, suﬀer some lag
spanning periods that range any time duration from
several months to several years with respect to the
progress of other FTS belonging to the same business
sector or to the stock market index.

The behaviour we describe seems compatible with the
overall picture that any lag in the progress of the PPS of
some company in comparison to other similar companies
makes it attractive to the investors. That interest even

increases as the lag gets more pronounced.
cases, this induces a recovery phase in which the PPS
readjusts with a rise that is larger the more important
the respective PPS diﬀerence is.

The length of the recovery phase depends intimately
on the overall Economical situation that might interfere
with the growth, nevertheless it is reasonable to expect
a readjustment of the price share in such a way it con-
forms to the other shares belonging to the same category.

The region of validity of the results we obtain spans
the stable as well as the period after the jump of the
PPS. We observed that the long term evolution of the
PPS after the jump is highly variable depending on the
market reaction.
In the framework of our model, this
means that after the jump, we are in a stage where
the strict conditions for the validity of the combustion
model are no longer obeyed.

The simple combustion model

is a straightforward
translation of the above facts with the proviso of a sound
interpretation of its basic parameters that ought to be
evaluated from the portfolio of the company of interest
and the background Economical context. Identifying the
parameters of the combustion model from Economical
data and assessing them is presently work in progress.

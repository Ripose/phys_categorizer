Abstract

We study the evolutionary Prisoner’s Dilemma on two social networks obtained from actual

relational data. We ﬁnd very diﬀerent cooperation levels on each of them that can not be

easily understood in terms of global statistical properties of both networks. We propose

to look instead at the mesoscopic scale, speciﬁcally to the community structure of the net-

works, and show that the reason for this diﬀerent cooperation behavior can be traced back

to their intermediate-scale features. We explain the dependence of the cooperation level on

the temptation parameter in terms of the internal structure of the communities and their in-

terconnections. Our results support the conclusion that studies of games on model networks

and their interpretation in terms of global properties may not be suﬃcient to study speciﬁc,

real social systems. In addition, the community perspective may be helpful to interpret the

origin and behavior of existing networks as well as to design structures that show resilient

cooperative behavior.

INTRODUCTION

The emergence and survival of cooperation in adverse environments has been, for a

long time, a challenging problem for scholars in disciplines as diverse as biology, sociology

or economics [1, 2, 3]. While some answers have been advanced in the last forty years,

including kin selection [4], reciprocity [5], repeated interactions [6], or indirect reciprocity

[7], cooperation among unrelated individuals is far from understood. Social dilemmas,

situations in which individual rationality leads to situations in which everyone is worse

oﬀ, are a prominent example of this conundrum [8]. Within the general framework of

evolutionary game theory, which is particularly well suited to study this problem, the

Prisoner’s Dilemma (PD) is a paradigmatic setting to capture the paradox of altruism

persistence against short-term beneﬁts of egoism. In this game two players choose between

cooperation (C) or defection (D). If they both cooperate or defect they receive a payoﬀ of
magnitude R (for reward) or P (for punishment) respectively; if one of them chooses C and
the other decides D, the latter obtains a payoﬀ T (for temptation) and the former ends
up with the sucker’s payoﬀ S. Relations between diﬀerent possible payoﬀs follow the rule:
2R > T > R > P > S, that immediately poses the dilemma: While the rational choice

is to defect, it leads to a highly ineﬃcient outcome as compared to that obtained by two

cooperators.

Among the plethora of studies devoted to this issue, a particularly important and

fruitful one is the modeling of the population as a set of non-rational, learning agents that

interact locally [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. Locality is introduced in the model through a

regular lattice in which agents are placed. These agents then play the game only with their

neighbors (in neighborhoods that can be deﬁned in diﬀerent ways) instead of interacting

with all other agents. Learning is introduced through imitation: after a round of games

has been carried through the whole lattice, agents look at their neighbors and choose the

strategy that has led to the highest payoﬀ before proceeding to the next round of games.

With these two ingredients, namely locality and imitation, it is generally observed that
states in which a sizeable part of the population cooperates emerge (at least for values of T
not too close to 2R), the mechanism for this emergence being the formation of clusters of

cooperators that can successfully outcompete defectors.

2

In view of this conclusion, valid for the PD on regular lattices, the question arises as to

whether the result applies also to social networks. As a ﬁrst step to answer this question,

some authors have focused their interest on the inﬂuence of certain structural features

that have been observed in real networks on the evolution of cooperation [17, 18, 19].

Thus, Abramson and Kuperman [17] studied the small-world phenomenon [20], ﬁnding a

non-monotonic dependence of the density of cooperators on the number of long-range links
and on T , while Dur´an and Mulet [18] analyzed Poisson random graphs, and concluded

that in this case the asymptotic state was non-stationary. More recently, Santos and

coworkers [19] considered scale-free networks as models for social networks, and observed a

region of parameters for the PD where cooperation was the asymptotic state. A general

conclusion of this research is that the inhomogeneity of the degree distribution plays a

central role on this issue, and that it may favor the emergence of cooperation. However,

none of these studies deals with true social networks, as they are all based on diﬀerent

types of artiﬁcial models (small-world, Poisson random, scale-free). It is only natural then

to ask about the emergence and survival of cooperation in social networks obtained directly

from experiments or measurements [21].

To our knowledge, there is only one paper about the PD on real social networks [22],

in which the dynamics of cooperation driven by random mutations is studied, motivating

further claims of the relevance of the inhomogeneous degree distribution and of the links

between hubs or highly connected sites. However, as the point of view in [22] is dynamical,

and the learning rule is not unconditional imitation, it is not possible to make a direct

comparison to earlier works. Therefore, our research is a ﬁrst attempt to understand the

relevance of introducing empirical social networks as a support for the local interactions

in the framework of imitation models [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. There are a number of

reasons to stick to this learning rule. From the theoretical viewpoint, it is clear that other

rules, such as best-reply, will lead straightforwardly to a fully defecting population even

with local interactions. It can be argued that imitation is too simple a rule but, as discussed

in [13], there are several reasons why agents may fail to recognize they are in a dilemma

situation, which would lead them to defection. In addition, for global interactions learning

by imitation ends up in global defection, and hence cooperation in a local model can not be

3

due solely to this learning rule. From the experimental viewpoint, there are several reports

that indicate that imitation is commonly used by humans [23, 24, 25]. Finally, imitation

can be justiﬁed in psychological terms by looking at how conﬁrmation and disconﬁrmation

of beliefs are carried out [26] and has been also proposed as a relevant force to drive the

evolution towards economic equilibrium [27].

Into this well established and accepted scenario of local interactions and learning by

imitation, we bring in a mesoscopic perspective, by focusing on the community structure of

the social network. This is one of the most relevant characteristics of real social networks

and, as we will see below, it gives rise to very important diﬀerences in behavior: Indeed,

the main result of our research is that cooperation may or may not emerge in a true

social network depending on the structure of its communities. After providing evidence

supporting this conclusion, we will identify the speciﬁc mesoscopic structural properties

responsible for these opposite behaviors, namely the intra- and inter-community structures.

Our results make clear that in order to understand cooperation in social networks a detailed

analysis of these mesoscopic features is needed, and that a generic, separate study of the

inﬂuence of speciﬁc structural characteristics (such as a scale free degree distribution or

the small-world property) may not apply to actual sociological issues. We will also discuss

how the observed behaviors are connected to the design or origin of the networks considered.

II. METHODS

A. Datasets

For our research we have used two social substrates obtained by sampling real relational

data. The ﬁrst substrate is a social network obtained from the email traﬃc between

members of University Rovira i Virgili (in Tarragona, Spain; email network from now

on), where nodes represent individual email addresses and undirected links between two

nodes indicate bidirectional communication (at least one email in each direction) [28]. Our

second real social substrate nodes represent users of the ”Pretty-Good-Privacy” encryption

algorithm (PGP network, from now on), and links trace trust relationships between those

properties see Table 1. Note that neither of these social networks is bipartite, in contrast

with many other social networks in the literature that are build on a collaboration framework.

B. Communities

As the key concept to understand networks at a mesoscopic level, we propose to focus on

their community structure. Community structure is a common feature of many networks:

Communities arise as subgraphs with dense connection within themselves and sparser

ones between them, and very generally have functional implications [31]. Among the wide

variety of algorithms available to deﬁne the community distribution of networks [32], we

have chosen a divisive algorithm based on Extremal Optimization (EO) heuristics [33].

A detailed description of the method is beyond the scope of the paper, but full details

can be found elsewhere [34]. Once we have determined the number and size of networks

communities, we focus on the study of two structural mesoscopic characteristics: The

connectivity between communities and their internal organization.

C. Randomization

In order to understand the eﬀects of the community structure, we have compared the

results on the two networks with their randomized version preserving the degree of each

node, carried out through a rewiring process [35] (see Fig.1). The process, that consists

of choosing randomly two nodes and exchanging one neighbor of each node (also selected

randomly), destroys correlations between nodes and in particular the community structure.

The comparison should reveal the eﬀects introduced on the PD game by the community

distribution, separating them from those ones generated by the degree distribution (for this

topic see e.g. [19, 36] and references therein).

results).

Our simulations of the PD over all the networks follow strictly the rules in [10, 12],

• Initial strategies of agents are assigned randomly with the same probability to be C or

D (we have checked that other choices for the initial fraction of C or D lead to similar

• The game is played between each pair of neighbors. Payoﬀs are R = 1, T = b (b > 1),

S = P = 0, b being our control parameter.

• Accumulated payoﬀs of all agents are computed by adding up the results of the games

6

with their neighbors in the present turn.

• In the next round, every agent imitates the strategy of the most successful agent in

her neighborhood (randomly selected if there are two or more agents with the same

payoﬀ), after which payoﬀs are reset to zero.

III. RESULTS

Let us begin by examining the results of simulations of the PD on real social networks as
a function of the temptation parameter b. In Fig. 2 we plot the ﬁnal density of cooperators

on the two cases addressed here, email and PGP. The ﬁrst remarkable feature of these plots
is the high level of cooperation attained even for large values of b on both networks, as

compared to the results on regular lattices [10, 12, 16] with the same imitation dynamics.

The cooperation levels are not as high as those reported by Santos et al.

[36, 37] on

scale free networks, although in their simulations the dynamics is stochastic, and therefore

a direct comparison can not be made.

In this regard we want to stress that the two

networks we are analyzing can not be considered scale-free: The e-mail network has a

clear exponential distribution of degrees, and the PGP presents two regions with a clear
crossover from a power law behavior with exponents −2.63 (for degree k < 40) and −4 (for
degree k > 40) indicating clearly a bounded degree distribution.

Figure 2 allows also to extract another very relevant observation: The dependence of
the level of cooperation on the temptation parameter b is very diﬀerent for both networks.

As we may see from the plots, the cooperation level on the email network is a decreasing
function of b, going from values very close to unanymous cooperation for b >∼ 1 to about
a 15% for b close to 2. On the contrary, the PGP network presents an almost constant
cooperation level, with a variation of a 10% at most in all the range of b values, except for
b = 2. These results inmediately lead to the conclusion that there is no typical behavior

of the cooperation level on true social networks, at least in the framework of the PD with

imitation dynamics or learning.

The above conclusion is further reinforced by noting that the cooperation level in each

network changes in a very diﬀerent manner when their community structure is taken away.

as a function of b, obtained by numerical simulations on the email (top) and PGP (bottom)

networks. Red lines: Density of cooperators on random networks generated from the original

ones by a rewiring procedure that preserves the degree distribution, but breaks up the community

structure (see text). The equilibrium densities of cooperators have been obtained by averaging 500

generations, after a transient time of 750 generation steps. Each point corresponds to an average

over 1000 independent simulations with 50% cooperators and defectors as the initial condition.

Indeed, if we compare the results of playing the game on each lattice with those obtained

in their randomized version, generated as described above, we observe opposite behaviors.

On one hand, on the email network cooperation reaches extremal values, higher than the
random case when b is close to 1, and lower when b is close to its maximum limit of 2.

On the other hand, the PGP network exhibits exactly the opposite behavior: Cooperation
is better on the random version for low values of the temptation b, and worse for higher

values. Remarkably, the cooperation level in the random versions of the two networks

is very similar, and close to those reported in [18] for Poisson graphs and in [37] for the

conﬁguration (random) model, although it must be kept in mind that the dynamics is

diﬀerent in the latter case; interestingly, this does not seem to induce large diﬀerences in

8

behavior in this respect.

Our two examples, email and PGP, do not seem to ﬁt in any of the categories previously

reported in the literature for the behavior of the PD, which implies that the macroscopic

(global, statistical) diﬀerences between both topologies (see Table 1) are not determinant

for the opposite behaviors observed. Furthermore, the fact that destroying the correlations,

in particular their community structure, preserving the degree distribution, drives the

behavior of the two networks to the same general pattern, points directly to the mesoscopic

organizational level as the possible source of the explanation for the dramatic diﬀerences

observed in the original systems. Therefore, in order to gain insight on this problem, we

have to make a deeper analysis of the structure of both networks, an analysis that must

proceed at an intermediate level in view of the fact that neither the whole network nor

individual agents provide the clue to understanding our observations.

IV. DISCUSSION

A.

Inter-community structure

To summarize the results obtained from a community analysis of both social networks

and to facilitate their comparison, the outcome of our analysis is jointly presented in

Fig. 3. Each node corresponds to a community, and a link between two nodes denotes

cross-relations. In addition, size of nodes and links give information about community size

and number of cross-links, respectively. It is evident from the plot that communities in the

email network are densely interconnected, organized almost as a fully connected graph with

almost constant weighted degree distribution. On the contrary, the community network

corresponding to PGP presents a sparser pattern of links satisfying an exponential form for

the weighted degree distribution.

How can diﬀerences in connectivity between communities result in the behaviors shown

in the previous section? To answer this question, consider an isolated community, which

we could see as a small separate network, and where the PD game evolves in principle

to a steady state that depends mainly on local conditions (initial densities of C and D
and structure) and on b.

Imagine now that the links with the rest of the network are

progressively brought into the picture: The local dependence is in turn inﬂuenced by a

macroscopic scale dependence. As cross-connection progresses, the dynamics of the game

inside the community becomes more and more vulnerable to external (i.e., from outside

the community) inﬂuences such as, e.g., global cooperator hubs (when temptation to
defect, b, is low) or defection avalanches (as the b parameter grows). This rationale implies

immediately that from the observed community structure, the cooperation level should be

less dependent on the temptation parameter on the PGP network, where communities are

less interconnected, than on the email network, in agreement with the results above.

10

B.

Intra-community structure

The internal structure of communities in both networks also presents diﬀerences that

can be related to the results obtained. To reveal this inﬂuence, we have studied the internal

(i.e., within the community) degree distribution of communities on the attained cooperation

level. To represent the results for all communities in a way that allows comparison in

a direct manner, we have calculated the normalized diﬀerence between the average and

the maximum value of the internal degree in each community. Figure 4 shows the results

obtained: Comparing both diagrams, we notice that the internal degree of communities

forming the email network is quite homogeneous, while the case of PGP communities

presents (in most cases) maximum internal degrees that stand out signiﬁcantly from the

average value (up to 30 times the average degree), implying a very large heterogeneity. We

have called these nodes with very high internal degree local hubs.

Previous works have stressed the role of hubs at a macroscopical level in PD dynamics

on adaptive networks [38, 39, 40]. Although our networks are static,

it is expected

that the presence of these local hubs in PGP communities (as well as their absence in

the email ones) inﬂuences strongly the evolution of the PD on these networks. To be

speciﬁc, local hubs play a double stabilizing role: First, as most nodes in the commu-

nity are directly linked to their local hub, the whole community tends to imitate the

strategy of the hub; second, when a less connected member of the community changes

her strategy following an external node, the inﬂuence of the local hub makes it harder

for this strategy to spread to the whole community. On the contrary, homogeneous

internal degree distributions, as in the case of the email network, lead to a behavior that

is not governed by hubs: All nodes are more or less equivalent, and subsequently their

strategies evolve in a synchronized manner, at least to some degree. That this is indeed

the case is shown in the example of Fig. 5, where we can clearly observe some communi-

ties (marked in red) changing strategy from one step to the next almost as a coherent group.

In fact, these oscillations provide yet another manner to characterize the diﬀerence be-

tween the two networks of our study: We can also monitor the proportion of unsatisﬁed

agents, where an unsatisﬁed agent is deﬁned as an agent that switches strategy cyclically

over time. The results for both networks are shown in Fig. 6. We see that for both networks

the number of unsatisﬁed agents grows with the temptation parameter. We note in passing

that the density of unsatisﬁed agents in the randomized networks (not shown), consistently

with the results in [18] for Poisson graphs, is appreciably larger than in the original ones,

indicating once again that the community structure plays a key role in this problem. For

the email network the average density per community of unsatisﬁed agents behaves like the
fraction of unsatisﬁed agents, but for the PGP network there is a peak at b = 1.3 and sub-
squently decreases with increasing b. We have checked that this behavior is due to a speciﬁc
community, which oscillates with a larger amplitude than the rest. As b increases, more

communities begin to oscillate and the eﬀect of this particular one is averaged out. On the

information about this type of network representation.

other hand, and in agreement with our expectations based on the discussion in this section,

the behavior of PGP communities is much more static because local hubs act as controllers

of the community (and hence as inhibitors of the oscillations), as clearly shown in Fig. 7.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this work we have addressed the issue of the emergence of cooperation on true social

networks in the framework of the evolutionary PD with imitation. Our results on two

diﬀerent networks show clearly that the speciﬁc details of the network considered are very

relevant to determine the level of cooperation reached. Furthermore, our analysis sheds

light on the role played by community structure in promoting or inhibiting cooperation in

social networks: Our results strongly suggest that two mesoscopic structural properties (the

connectivity between communities and their internal structure) inﬂuence the evolution of

cooperation in social networks by increasing or lowering the stability of the behavior of the

communities against changes on the temptation to defect. Thus, on one hand, the email

network presents a dense connectivity between communities and quite homogeneous degree

distributions within communities. The interplay of these two properties imposes a high
sensitivity of cooperation to changes on the b value, that manifests itself in the coherent

behavior of communities. On the other hand, the PGP network exhibits very diﬀerent

characteristics at a mesoscopic level, namely sparse connectivity between communities and

presence of local hubs. These are both stabilizing properties that contribute to a scenario

with high stability against defection and a cooperation level almost independent of the

temptation parameter. Interestingly, recent work [41] on artiﬁcial networks, studying the

PD Erd¨os-R´enyi and Barab´asi-Albert models ﬁnds also diﬀerent levels of cooperation

on both systems that resemble our observations here (the properties of the Erd¨os-R´enyi

and Barab´asi-Albert models are similar, respectively, to our email and PGP networks),

and advance an explanation in terms of hubs much as we do here, although from a more

microscopic viewpoint.

From an evolutionary perspective, the work by Egu´ıluz et al. [38] indicates that if

the network is allowed to co-evolve with the strategies, a network with hubs develops.

Interestingly, in this network with hubs, the cooperation level shows similar dependence on

the temptation parameter, much as we have found here. Along similar lines, recent work

by Santos et al. [40, 42] suggests a connection between the emergence of cooperation and

the evolutionary appearance of degree heterogeneity. In this context, our study, which we

15

stress is carried out on static networks, suggests that the cooperation levels we observe in

the PD may be related to the diﬀerent origin of the two networks: While the PGP network

is spontaneously formed and with a clearly cooperative goal in mind (namely, ﬁnding help

to ensure communication privacy), the email network arises from an underlying external

structure, whose main purpose is not so clearly cooperative as it involves many other

aspects and tasks. Our results would then support the existence of community structures

organized around hubs with resilient cooperative behavior.

The above comment suggests, in addition, that our results may be of interest for the

design of hierarchies and organizations with tailored cooperation behavior. We have

seen that the email network reaches, for moderate values of the temptation parameter,

cooperation levels very close to the optimum. Therefore, networks with this structure

should be used in order to achieve very high performance levels in terms of cooperation. On

the other hand, while the email network is quite susceptible to an increase of the temptation

parameter, and hence exhibits a degrading of the cooperation for large temptations, the

PGP network, with its weakly connected communities with hubs, is much more robust in

this respect, and ensures cooperation for almost any temptation. Organizations with a

PGP-like structure would exhibit a very robust cooperation, although there would always

be defectors. Further research at the mesoscopic scale, looking at diﬀerent combinations

of the inter- and intra-community structures, could lead to designs that would be both

optimum and robust. On the other hand, the coherent oscillation behavior observed in the

email network may be used jointly with other synchronization schemes recently proposed

[43] for community detection and analysis.

Finally, we want to emphasize our main conclusion, namely that cooperation in real

social networks is a complex issue depending on the combination of the eﬀects of several

structural features. This result has far-reaching implications: Thus, several previous

researches have considered how cooperation emerges in the PD on diﬀerent model networks,

including gaussian, scale free and small world ones as paradigms of social networks. There

are two main diﬀerences between our work and those previous ones: ﬁrst, the cooperation

level is in general higher that in the model networks, and second, that results are very

diﬀerent for similar global parameters of the network due to the inﬂuence of the community

16

structure, often undetected by global measurements. It is then clear that any approximation

to the evolution of cooperation in social networks based on the generalization of only one

of these structural features is far too simplistic and may be misleading. We envisage that

similar conclusions may apply to other models of cooperation or coordination based on

other games, as arguments based on the inter- and intra-structure of the communities may

well carry over to them. In any event, we believe that subsequent studies on these issues

should then be carried out on a case by case basis, and should involve a careful analysis at

a mesoscopic (community) level, trying to ﬁnd out whether behaviors can be predicted or

classiﬁed in classes attending to this structure.

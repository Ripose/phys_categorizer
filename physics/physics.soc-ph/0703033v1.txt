Modular structure is ubiquitous among complex networks. To see why such networks evolve to-
wards modular organization we note that they are subject to multiple structural and functional
constraints, e.g., minimizing the average path length and the total number of links, while max-
imizing robustness against perturbations in node activity. We show that the optimal networks
satisfying these three constraints are characterized by the existence of multiple sub-networks (mod-
ules) sparsely connected to each other. In addition, these modules have distinct hubs resulting in
an overall heterogeneous degree distribution, as seen in many real networks.

Complex networks have recently become a focus of sci-
entiﬁc attention, with many natural, social and techno-
logical networks seen to share certain universal structural
features [1, 2]. These networks often exhibit topological
characteristics that are far from random. For instance,
they show a signiﬁcant presence of hubs, i.e., nodes with
large degree or number of connections to other nodes. In-
deed, hubs are crucial for linking nodes in real networks,
which have extremely sparse connectivity, with the prob-
ability of connection between any pair of nodes, C, vary-
ing between 10−1
10−8 [1]. A random network with
such small C is almost always disconnected. However,
a few hubs enable the entire network to be connected,
still keeping the total number of links small. These hubs
also lead to the “small-world” eﬀect [3] by reducing the
average path length of the network. Another property
observed in many networks is the existence of a modu-
lar structure. We deﬁne a network to be modular if it
can be decomposed into distinct sub-networks or mod-
ules by removing a few links. Such networks exhibit sig-
niﬁcantly more intra-modular connections compared to
inter-modular connections. Modular networks observed
in empirical studies span a wide range from cellular net-
works involved in metabolism and signalling [4, 5, 6, 7],
to cortical networks [8], social networks [9], food webs [10]
and the internet [11]. Many of these networks also ex-
hibit large number of hubs, which often have the role of
interconnecting diﬀerent modules [12].

The majority of previous studies on modular networks
have been concerned with methods to identify community
structure of a network [13]. There have been relatively
few attempts to explain the potentially more interesting
question of how and why modularity emerges in com-
plex networks. Most such attempts are based on the
notion of evolutionary pressure, where a system is driven
towards a modular architecture by the need for adapt-
ing to changing environment [14, 15]. However, such ex-
planations involve complicated adaptive mechanisms, in
which the environment itself is assumed to change in a
modular fashion. Further, adaptation might lead to de-
crease in connectivity through biased selection of sparse

networks, which eventually results in disruption of the
network with the modules being isolated nodes [14] or
disconnected parts [16].

A crucial limitation of these above studies is that they
almost always focus on a single performance parameter.
However, in reality, most networks have to optimize be-
tween several, often conﬂicting, constraints. While struc-
tural constraints, such as path length, had been the focus
of initial work by network researchers, there has been a
growing realization that most networks have dynamics
associated with their nodes [17]. The robustness of net-
work behavior such as synchronized dynamical states, is
often vital to the eﬃcient functioning of many systems,
and also imposes an important constraint on networks.
Therefore, the role played by dynamical considerations
in determining the topological properties of a network is
a challenging and important question that opens up new
possibilities for explaining observed features of complex
networks.
In this letter, we propose a simple mecha-
nism for the emergence of modularity in networks as an
optimal solution for satisfying a minimal set of struc-
tural and functional constraints. These essentially in-
volve (i) reducing the average path length, ℓ, of a network
by (ii) using a minimum number of total links, Ltotal,
while (iii) ensuring the stability of dynamical states as-
sociated with the network.

We investigate the dynamical stability of a network by
measuring the rate at which a small perturbation about
an equilibrium state of the network dynamics grows with
time. This is determined by the largest real part λmax
of the eigenvalues for the Jacobian matrix J represent-
ing the interactions among the nodes [18]. The system is
stable if λmax < 0, and unstable otherwise. The matrix
elements Jij (
Aij Wij ) include information about both
the topological structure of the network, given by the ad-
jacency matrix A (Aij is 1, if nodes i, j are connected, and
0, otherwise), as well as, the distribution of interaction
strengths Wij between nodes. In our simulations, Wij has
a Gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance σ2;
however, a non-zero mean does not qualitatively change
our results. For an Erd¨os-Renyi (ER) random network, J

is a sparse random matrix, with λmax
1, ac-
cording to the May-Wigner theorem [19]. Increasing the
system size N , connectivity C or interaction strength σ,
results in a transition from stability to instability for the
dynamical state of the network. This result has been
shown to be remarkably robust with respect to various
generalizations [20].

Networks are also subject to certain structural con-
straints. One of them is the need to save resources, man-
ifested in minimizing link cost, i.e., the cost involved in
building and maintaining each link in a network [21, 22].
This results in the network having a small total number
of links, Ltotal. However, such a procedure runs counter
to another important consideration for networks, namely,
reducing the average path length ℓ, which improves its
eﬃciency by increasing the communication speed among
the nodes [23]. The conﬂict between these two criteria
can be illustrated through the example of airline trans-
portation networks. Although, fastest communication
(i.e., small ℓ) will be achieved if every airport is connected
to every other through direct ﬂights, such a system is
prohibitively expensive as every route involves some cost
in maintaining it. In reality, therefore, one observes the
existence of airline hubs, which act as transit points for
passengers arriving from and going to other airports.

For ER random networks, although ℓ is low, Ltotal is
high because of the requirement to ensure that the net-

work is connected: Ltotal > N lnN [24]. Introducing the
constraint of link cost (i.e., minimizing Ltotal) while re-
quiring low average path length ℓ, leads to a star-like
connection topology (Fig. 1C). We deﬁne a star network
as one with a single hub to which all other nodes are
connected, there being no other links.
Its average de-
2 is non-extensive with system size, and is
gree
much smaller than a connected random network, where

However, such star-like networks are extremely unsta-

is the displacement due to a 1-dimensional random walk
of N

dom numbers chosen from a N ormal (0, σ2) distribution.
To obtain networks which satisfy the dynamical as well
as the structural constraints we perform optimization us-
ing simulated annealing, with a network having N nodes
1 links (the smallest number that would allow
and N
the network to be connected). Having ﬁxed Ltotal, the
energy function to be minimized is deﬁned as

where 0
1 is the parameter that denotes the rel-
ative importance of the path length constraint with re-
spect to the condition for dynamical stability. At each
step a rewiring is done and the update is (i) rejected
if the updated network is disconnected, (ii) accepted if
Einitial < 0, and (iii) if δE > 0, then
δE = Ef inal
accepted with probability p = exp(
δE/T ), where T is
the “temperature”. The initial temperature was chosen
in such a way that energetically unfavorable moves had
80% chance of being accepted. After each monte carlo
step (N updates) the temperature was reduced by 1%
and iterated till there was no change in the energy for
20 successive monte carlo steps. For each value of α, the
optimized network with lowest E was obtained from 100
realizations. The results for N = 64 are shown in Fig. 1.
As can be seen from Fig. 1, modularity emerges when
the system tries to satisfy the twin constraints of mini-
mizing ℓ as well as λmax. When α is very high (
0.8)
such that the dynamical stability criterion becomes less
important, the system shows a transition to a star-like
conﬁguration with a single hub. However, as α is de-
creased, the instability of the hub makes the network less
preferable and for intermediate values of α, the optimal
network gets divided into modules, as seen from the mea-

, where Bmax
are the largest and the mean link-betweenness
and
centrality, respectively, of the network [13]. For a modu-
lar network, µ is high, whereas for homogeneous, as well
as, for star-like networks, µ
0. The transition between
≈
modular and star structures is further emphasised in the
− Pk pklnpk, where
behavior of the degree entropy, H =
pk is the probability of a node having degree k. The
emergence of a dominant hub at a critical value of α is
marked by H reducing to a low value.

To understand why modular networks emerge as the
solution for simultaneous optimization of structural and
functional constraints we look at the change in stability
that occurs when a star network is split into m modules,
with each module connected to others through links be-
tween the corresponding hubs. The largest eigenvalue for
the entire system of N nodes is the same as that for each
N/m, as the additional eﬀect
isolated module, λmax
of the few inter-modular links is negligible. At the same
time, the increase in the average path length ℓ with m is
almost insigniﬁcant. Therefore, by dividing the network
into a connected set of small modules, each of which is
a star sub-network, the stability of the entire network
increases signiﬁcantly while still satisfying the structural
constraints.

The above results were obtained for a speciﬁc value
1). We now relax the constraint on
of Ltotal (= N
link cost by allowing a much larger number of links than
that strictly necessary to keep the network connected.
The larger value of Ltotal is manifested as random links
between non-hub nodes, resulting in higher clustering
within the network. For such clustered star networks
also, λmax increases with size as √N , and therefore, their
stability is enhanced by imposing a modular structure

FIG. 3: Probability distribution of λmax for clustered star net-
works (N = 256, Ltotal = 15N ) having four modules with dif-
ferent types of inter-modular connectivities (A), (B) and (C)
described in the text. Link weights Jij have a N ormal (0, σ2
)
distribution with σ2 = 0.018.

(Fig. 2). The eﬀect of increasing the number of mod-
ules, m, on the dynamical stability of a network can be
observed from the stability-instability transition that oc-
curs on increasing the network parameter σ keeping N, C
ﬁxed. We ﬁnd that the critical value at which the tran-
sition to instability occurs, σc, increases with m (Fig. 2,
inset) while ℓ does not change signiﬁcantly. This signi-
ﬁes that even for higher values of Ltotal, networks satisfy
the structural and functional constraints by adopting a
modular conﬁguration.

As Ltotal is increased, we observe that the additional
links in the optimized network occur between modules,
in preference to, between nodes in the same module. To
see why the network prefers the former conﬁguration, we
consider three diﬀerent types of inter-modular connec-
tions: (A) only the hub nodes of diﬀerent modules are
connected, (B) non-hub nodes of one module can con-
nect to the hub of another module, and (C) non-hub
nodes of diﬀerent modules are connected. Arrangement
(B) where inter-modular connections that link to hubs of
other modules actually increase the maximum degree of
the modules, making this arrangement less stable than
(A). On the other hand, (C) connections between non-
hub nodes of diﬀerent modules not only increase the sta-
bility (Fig. 3), but also reduce ℓ. As a result, the optimal
network will always prefer this arrangement (C) of large
number of random inter-modular connections over other
topologies for large Ltotal.

Our observation that both structural and dynamical
constraints are necessary for modularity to emerge runs
counter to the general belief that modularity necessar-
ily follows from the requirement of robustness alone, as
modules are thought to limit the eﬀects of local pertur-
bations in a network. To further demonstrate that the
three constraints are the minimal required for a network
to adopt a modular conﬁguration, we remove the hub
from a clustered star while ensuring that the network is
still connected. This corresponds to the absence of the

link cost constraint altogether and the optimal graph is
now essentially a random network. To see why modu-
larity is no longer observed in this case, we consider the
stability of an ER random network on which a modular
structure has been imposed. A network of N nodes is
divided into m modules, connected to each other with a
few inter-modular links. We then consider the stability-
instability transition of networks for increasing m, with
the average degree,
kept ﬁxed. Although from the
May-Wigner theorem, it may be naively expected that
is constant w.r.t. m, we actually observe
σc
that increasing m decreases stability (Fig. 4). This is be-
cause when a network of size N is split into m modules,
the stability of the entire network is decided by that of
the most unstable module, ignoring the small additional
eﬀect of inter-modular connections. Thus, the stability
of the entire network is decided by randomly drawing
m values from the distribution of λmax for the modules.
Therefore, for modular networks it is much more likely
that a positive λmax will occur (as there are m multiple
drawings), than for the case of a homogeneous random
network of size N [25]. The decrease of stability with
modularity for random networks shows that, in general,
it is not necessary that modularity is always stabilizing
and results in a robust network, as has sometimes been
claimed [14].

In this paper we have shown that modules of intercon-
nected nodes can arise as a result of optimizing between
multiple structural and functional constraints.
In par-
ticular, we show that by minimizing link cost as well as
path length, while at the same time increasing robust-
ness to dynamical perturbations, a system of nodes will
evolve to a conﬁguration having multiple modules char-
acterized by hubs, that are connected to each other. At
the limit of extremely small Ltotal this results in networks

4

with bimodal degree distribution, that has been previ-
ously shown to be robust with respect to both targeted
and random removal of nodes [26]. Therefore, not only
are such modular network dynamically stable, but they
are also robust with respect to structural perturbations.
In general, on allowing larger Ltotal, the optimized net-
works show heterogeneous degree distribution that has
been observed in a large class of networks occurring in
the natural and social world, including those termed as
scale-free networks [2]. Our results provide a glimpse into
how the topological structure of complex networks can be
related to functional and evolutionary considerations.

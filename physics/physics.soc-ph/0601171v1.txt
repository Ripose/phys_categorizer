Abstract

Self-organized criticality has been claimed to play an important role in many natural and social systems. In the
present work we empirically investigate the relevance of this theory to stock-market dynamics. Avalanches in
stock-market indices are identiﬁed using a multi-scale wavelet-ﬁltering analysis designed to remove Gaussian noise
from the index. Here new methods are developed to identify the optimal ﬁltering parameters which maximize the
noise removal. The ﬁltered time series is reconstructed and compared with the original time series. A statistical
analysis of both high-frequency Nasdaq E-mini Futures and daily Dow Jones data is performed. The results of this
new analysis conﬁrm earlier results revealing a robust power law behaviour in the probability distribution function
of the sizes, duration and laminar times between avalanches. This power law behavior holds the potential to be
established as a stylized fact of stock market indices in general. While the memory process, implied by the power
law distribution of the laminar times, is not consistent with classical models for self-organized criticality, we note
that a power-law distribution of the laminar times cannot be used to rule out self-organized critical behaviour.

1. Introduction

Attracted by several analogies with the dynam-
ics of natural systems, physicists, especially dur-
ing the last decade, have attempted to understand
the mechanism behind stock-market dynamics by
applying techniques and ideas developed in their
respective ﬁelds [1].

In this context, possible connections between
self-organized criticality (SOC) and the stock mar-
ket, or economics in general, have been investigated

theoretically [2,3,4,5,6]. The theory of SOC, orig-
inally proposed in the late eighty’s by Bak, Tang
and Wiesenfeld (BTW) [7] to explain the ubiquity
of power laws in Nature, is claimed to be relevant
in several diﬀerent areas of physics as well as bio-
logical and social sciences [4,8]. The key concept of
SOC is that complex systems – i.e. systems consti-
tuted by many non-linear interacting elements – al-
though obeying diﬀerent microscopic physics, may
naturally evolve toward a critical state where, in
analogy with physical systems near the phase tran-
sition, they can be characterized by power laws.
The critical state is an ensemble of metastable con-
ﬁgurations and the system evolves from one to an-

The classical example of a system exhibiting
SOC behaviour is the 2D sandpile model [7,8,4].
Here the cells of a grid are randomly ﬁlled, by
an external driver, with “sand”. When the gradi-
ent between two adjacent cells exceeds a certain
threshold a redistribution of the sand occurs,
leading to more instabilities and further redistri-
butions. The benchmark of this system, indeed of
all systems exhibiting SOC, is that the distribu-
tion of the avalanche sizes, their duration and the
energy released, obey power laws. As such, they
are scale-free.

In the present work we search for imprints of
SOC in the stock market by studying the statis-
tics of the coherent periods (that is, periods of
high volatility), or avalanches, which character-
ize its evolution. We analyze the tick-by-tick be-
haviour of the Nasdaq E-mini Futures (NQ) in-
dex, P (t), from 21/6/1999 to 19/6/2002 for a to-
tal of 219 data. In particular, we study the loga-
rithmic returns of this index, which are deﬁned as
r(t) = ln [P (t)/P (t
1)]. Possible diﬀerences be-
tween daily and high frequency data have also been
taken into consideration through the analysis of
the Dow Jones daily closures (DJ) from 2/2/1939
to 13/4/2004, for a total of 1014 data.

This work extends our earlier work on this sub-
ject [9] by introducing new criteria to optimize the
ﬁltering of the time series essential to separating
quiescent and avalanche dynamics. The properties
of the time series reconstructed from the ﬁltered
returns are also examined. The issue regarding the
presence of SOC in the stock market is of not only
of theoretical importance, since it would lead to
improvements in ﬁnancial modeling, but could also
enhance the predictive power [10] of Econophysics.
In the next section we present the analysis
methodology while in Sec. 3 the results of the anal-
ysis are presented. Discussions and conclusions
are contained in the last section.

2. Avalanche Identiﬁcation via Wavelets

The logarithmic returns of stock indices rarely
display intervals of genuinely quiescent periods, yet

2

such periods are vital to the quantitative identiﬁ-
cation of avalanche dynamics. As such, noise must
be ﬁltered from the time series. Ideally, only Gaus-
sian noise, associated with the eﬃcient phases of
the market where the movements can be well ap-
proximated by a random walk [1], is to be ﬁltered
from the time-series returns. Such dynamics have
no memory and contrast the avalanche dynamics,
i.e. anomalous periods characterized by large ﬂuc-
tuations, that we aim to analyze.

Naively, one might simply set a threshold for
the logarithmic returns, below which the index is
deemed to be laminar. However, a simple threshold
method is not appropriate, as it would include in
the ﬁltering some non-Gaussian returns at small
scales that are relevant in our analysis.

This diﬃculty is illustrated in Fig. 1 (Top)
where the probability distribution function (PDF)
for the returns of the NQ index, ﬁltered using a
ﬁxed threshold of rth = 5 standard deviations is
shown by the open squares. In this case broad
wings, related to events that do not follow Gaus-
sian statistics, are clearly evident.

However, an important stylized fact of ﬁnancial
returns – the intermittency of ﬁnancial returns [1]
– can be used to identify an appropriate ﬁltering
scheme. Already, physicists have drawn analogies
with the well known phenomenon of intermittency
in the spatial velocity ﬂuctuations of hydrody-
namic ﬂows [11,12,13]. Both systems display broad
tails in the probability distribution function [1],
and a non-linear multifractal spectrum [12], as
a result of this feature. The empirical analogies
between turbulence and the stock market suggest
the existence of a temporal information cascade
for the latter [12]. This is equivalent to suggesting
that various traders require diﬀerent information
according to their speciﬁc strategies. In this way,
diﬀerent time scales become involved in the trad-
ing process.

In the present work we use a wavelet method in
order to study multi-scale market dynamics. The
wavelet transform is a relatively new tool for the
study of intermittent and multifractal signals [14].
This approach enables one to decompose the signal
in terms of scale and time units and so to separate
its coherent parts – i.e. the bursty periods related
to the tails of the PDF – from the noise-like back-

ground. This enables an independent study of the
avalanches and the quiescent intervals [15].

The wavelet transform (WT) is deﬁned as the
scalar product of the analyzed signal, f (t), at
scale λ and time t, with a real or complex “mother
wavelet”, ψ(t). In the discrete wavelet transform
(DWT) case, used herein, this reads:

where the mother wavelet is scaled using a dyadic
set. One chooses λ = 2j, for j = 0, ..., L
1, where
λ is the scale of the wavelet and L is the number of
scales involved, and the temporal coeﬃcients are
separated by multiples of λ for each dyadic scale,
t = n2j, with n being the index of the coeﬃcient
at the jth scale.

−

The wavelet coeﬃcients are a measure of the
correlation between the original signal, f (t), and
the mother wavelet, ψ(t), at scale j and time n.
In the analysis presented in the next section, we
use the Daubechies–4 wavelet as the orthonormal
basis [16]. However, tests performed with diﬀerent
sets do not show any qualitative diﬀerence in the
results.

The utility of the wavelet transform in the study
of turbulent signals lies in the fact that the large
amplitude wavelet coeﬃcients are related to the ex-
treme events corresponding to the tails of the PDF,
while the laminar or quiescent periods are related
to the coeﬃcients with smaller amplitude [17]. In
this way, it is possible to deﬁne a criterion whereby
one can ﬁlter the time series of the coeﬃcients de-
pending on the speciﬁc needs. In our case, we adopt
the method used in Ref. [17] and originally pro-
posed by Katul et al. [18]. In this method wavelet
coeﬃcients that exceed a ﬁxed threshold are set to
zero, according to

for ﬁltering is also shown. In this case it is clear that we do
not remove just Gaussian noise, but also coherent events

the movements can be well approximated by a ran-
dom walk [1] are preserved.

Once we have ﬁltered the wavelet coeﬃcients
˜Wj,n an inverse wavelet transform is performed,
obtaining what should approximate Gaussian
noise. The PDF of this ﬁltered time series is shown,
along with the original PDF in Fig. 1 (Top). It is
evident how the distribution of the ﬁltered signal
matches perfectly a Gaussian distribution.

In the same ﬁgure (Bottom), we also show the
logarithmic returns, R(t), of the original time series
after the ﬁltered time series has been subtracted.
Truly quiescent periods are now evident, contrast-
ing the the bursty periods, or avalanches, which we
aim to study.

The time series of logarithmic prices is recon-
structed from the residuals in Fig. 2 and is con-
trasted with the one reconstructed from the ﬁltered

the time series reconstructed from the ﬁltered returns and
the residual returns remaining after the ﬁltered returns are
subtracted from the original returns. The price behaviour
generated by the “eﬃcient” or ﬁltered returns is largely
independent of the observed price. The ﬁltering parameter,
in this case, is C = 1.

latter case, the time series is completely indepen-
dent of the actual market price.

To this point, the ﬁltering parameter, C, has
been constrained to 1, thus preserving coeﬃcients
that are less than the average coeﬃcient at a par-
ticular scale. However, one might wonder if it is
possible to tune this parameter to maximally re-
move the uninteresting Gaussian noise from the
original signal.

investigated here. Moreover, pure noise signals are
completely ﬁltered with this simple consideration.
An examination of the standard autocorrelation
function of the ﬁltered time series shows a complete
temporal independence, further conﬁrming that we
have successfully ﬁltered pure Gaussian noise.

Once we have isolated and removed noise from
the time series we are able to perform a reliable
statistical analysis on the avalanches of the residual
returns, Fig. 1 (Bottom). In particular, we deﬁne
an avalanche as the periods of the residual returns
in which the volatility, v(t)
, is above a

small threshold, typically two orders of magnitude
smaller than the characteristic return.

A parallel between avalanches in the classical
sandpile models (BTW models) exhibiting SOC [7]
and the previously deﬁned coherent events in the
stock market is straightforward. In order to test
the relation between the two, we make use of some
properties of the BTW models. In particular, we
use the fact that the avalanche size distribution and
the avalanche duration are distributed according
to power laws, while the laminar, or waiting times
between avalanches are exponentially distributed,
reﬂecting the lack of any temporal correlation be-
tween them [19,20]. This is equivalent to stating
that the triggering process has no memory.

Similar to the dissipated energy in a turbulent
ﬂow, we deﬁne an avalanche size, V , in the mar-
ket context as the integrated value of the squared
volatility over each coherent event of the residual
returns. The duration, D, is deﬁned as the inter-

The data analyzed herein display a distribution
of laminar times diﬀerent from the BTW model
of the classical sandpile. As explained previously,
the BTW model shows an exponential distribu-
tion for L, derived from a Poisson process with no
memory [19,20]. The power law distribution found
here implies the existence of temporal correlations
between coherent events. However this correlation
may have its origin in the driver of the market, con-
trasting the random driver of the classical sandpile.

4. Discussion and Conclusion

We have investigated the possible relations be-
tween the theory of self-organized criticality and
the stock market. The existence of a SOC state
for the latter would be of great theoretical impor-
tance, as this would impose constraints on the dy-
namics, as implied by the presence of a bounded
attractor in the state space. Moreover, it would be
possible to build new predictive schemes based on
this framework [10].

After a multiscale wavelet ﬁltering, an avalanche-
like dynamics has been revealed in two samples
of market data. The avalanches are characterized
by a scale-free behaviour in the size, duration and
laminar times. The power laws in the avalanche

val of time between the beginning and the end of
a coherent event, while the laminar time, L, is the
time elapsing between the end of an event and the
beginning of the next.

The results for the statistical analysis of the
optimally-ﬁltered NQ and DJ indices are shown in
Figs. 4, 5 and 6 for the avalanche size, duration and
laminar times, respectively. A power law relation is
clearly evident for all three quantities investigated.

size and duration are a characteristic feature of a
critical underlying dynamics in the system.

However, the power law behavior in the lami-
nar time distribution implies a memory process
in the triggering driver that is absent in the clas-
sical BTW models, where an exponential behav-
ior is expected. Remarkably, the same features
have been also observed in other physical con-
texts [19,17,21,22,23].

The problem of temporal correlation in the
avalanches of real systems, has raised debates in
the physics community, questioning the practical
applicability of the SOC framework [24]. Motived
by this issue, several numerical studies have been
devoted to including temporal correlations in SOC
models [25,26,27]. A power-law distribution in the
laminar times has been achieved, for example,
by substituting the random driver with a chaotic
one [28,29]. Alternatively, it has been shown that
non-conservative systems, as for the case of the
stock market, could be in a near-SOC state where
dissipation induces temporal correlations in the
avalanches while the power law dynamics persist
for the size and duration [30,31].

In conclusion, a deﬁnitive relation between SOC
theory and the stock market has not been found.
Rather, we have shown that a memory process is
related with periods of high activity. The memory
could result from some kind of dissipation of infor-
mation, similar to turbulence, or have its origin in a
chaotic driver applied to the self-organized critical
system. While a combination of the two processes
can also be possible, it is the latter property that
prevents one from ruling out the possibility that
the stock market is indeed in a SOC state [29].

Similar power-law behaviour has been found in
the ASX index for the Australian market [9] and
diﬀerent single stock time series. If this power-
law behaviour is conﬁrmed by further studies, this
should be considered as a stylized fact of stock mar-
ket dynamics.

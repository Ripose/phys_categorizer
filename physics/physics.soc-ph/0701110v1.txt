Abstract

The Epps eﬀect, the decrease of correlations between stock returns
for short time windows, was traced back to the trading asynchronic-
ity and to the occasional lead-lag relation between the prices. We
study pairs of stocks where the latter is negligible and conﬁrm the
importance of asynchronicity but point out that alone these aspects
are insuﬃcient to give account for the whole eﬀect.

1 Introduction

1979 T. W. Epps reported empirical results showing that stock return cor-
relations decrease as the sampling frequency increases [1]. Later this phe-
nomenon has been found in several studies of diﬀerent stock markets [2, 3]
and of foreign exchange markets [4, 5]. Since the most important factors in
classical portfolio management are the correlations between the individual
assets, the understanding and the accurate description of these correlations
on all time scales are of major importance.

Considerable eﬀort has been devoted to uncover the relationship of the
correlation coeﬃcient and the sampling frequency [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. So far
the studies have revealed two factors causing the Epps eﬀect. The ﬁrst one is
the lead-lag eﬀect [12, 13, 14] between the stock returns, which can occur for

pairs of stocks of very diﬀerent capitalization and/or for some functional de-
pendencies between them. In this case the maximum of the time-dependent
correlation function is at non zero time lag resulting in increasing correlations
as the sampling time scale gets in the same order of magnitude as the char-
acteristic lag (typically of the order of minutes) [3, 6]. However, in a recent
study [14] we showed that through the years this eﬀect becomes less im-
portant since the characteristic lag shrinks, signalizing an increasing market
eﬃciency.

The second, more important factor is the asynchronicity of trading [6, 7,
11, 15]. Empirical results showed that taking into account only synchronous
price ticks the Epps eﬀect is reduced, i.e., the measured correlations increase.
It is natural to assume that, for a given sampling frequency, increasing trad-
ing activity should enhance synchronicity, leading to a weaker Epps eﬀect.
Indeed, using Monte Carlo experiments, an inverse relation was found be-
tween trading activity and the correlation drop [6].

The aim of the present communication is to investigate empirically the
role of the trading activity on the Epps eﬀect. We ﬁnd that in contrast to the
simulations, the empirical data do not scale in the expected way indicating
that a further, possibly human factor is also at play.

2 Methodology

In our analysis we used the Trade and Quote (TAQ) Database of the New
York Stock Exchange (NYSE) for the period of 4.1.1993 to 31.12.2003, con-
taining tick-by-tick data. To avoid the problems occurring from splits in
the prices of stocks, which cause large logarithmic return values in the time
series, we applied a ﬁltering procedure. In high-frequency data, we omitted
returns larger than 5% of the current price of the stock. This retains all
logarithmic returns caused by simple changes in prices but excludes splits
which are usually half or one third of the price.

We computed the logarithmic returns of stock prices:

t(t) = ln

pA(t)
pA(t − D

where pA(t) stands for the price of stock A at time t. The time dependent
t (t ) of stocks A and B is deﬁned by

correlation function CA,B

For pairs of stocks with a lead–lag eﬀect the function CA,B

t has a peak at

non-zero t .

The equal-time correlation coeﬃcient is naturally: r A,B
t decreases as D

t (t = 0).In
our notations the Epps eﬀect means that r
t decreases (see
Figure 1).The prices are deﬁned as being constant between two consecutive
trades (previous tick estimator), thus the D
t time scale of the sampling can
be chosen arbitrarily.

t ≡ CA,B

3 Results

In order to separate the diﬀerent origins of the Epps eﬀect we consider only
pairs of stocks where the lead–lag eﬀect is neglible, i.e., for which the price
changes are highly correlated with the peak position of CA,B
t of Eq. 2 being at
t ≈ 0. Good candidates are the pairs Coca-Cola Company (KO) / PepsiCo,
Inc. (PEP), Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) / Deere & Company (DE), Wal-Mart
Stores, Inc. (WMT) / Sprint Nextel Corporation (S), etc. We shall illustrate
our ﬁndings on the example of KO/PEP but the other pairs show similar
behaviour.

In Figure 1 we show the correlation coeﬃcient as a function of the sam-
pling time scale for the whole period, 1993–2003.One can see that the corre-
lations increase as the sampling frequency decreases. The growth is very fast
in the beginning but several hours are needed for the correlation to reach its
asymptotical value.

To study the trading frequency dependence of the correlation drop we
computed the Epps-curve separately for diﬀerent years. Figure 2 shows the
correlation coeﬃcient as a function of the sampling time scale for the years
1993, 1997, 2000 and 2003.

As it is known, correlations are not constant through the years. Apart
from a growing trend, being a sign of growing eﬃciency [14], there are ﬂuc-
tuations which depend on the whole market. For example in crash periods

function of sampling time scale for the years 1993, 1997, 2000 and 2003 for

in spite of the considerably changing trading frequency (see Fig 4).

the complete market is moving together. We have to take this into account
and try to extract the eﬀect of changing asymptotic correlations from the
phenomenon studied.
In order to do this, we scaled the curves with their
asymptotic value: The latter was deﬁned as the mean of the correlation co-
eﬃcients for the sampling time scales D
t = 9000
seconds, and the correlations were divided by this value. Figure 3 shows the
scaled curves for the years 1993, 1997, 2000 and 2003.

t = 6000 seconds through D

Knowing that the trading activity almost monotonously grew in the pe-
riod studied (as it can be seen in Figure 4), one would expect the diminution
of the Epps eﬀect, and thus much weaker decrease of the correlations as
sampling frequency is increased. However, after scaling with the asymptotic
correlation value, the curves give a reasonable data collapse and no system-
atic trend can be seen. Surprisingly, increasing the trading frequency by a
factor of ∼ 5 does not lead to a measurable reduction of the characteristic
time of the Epps eﬀect.

These observations show that the eﬀect of asynchronicity in trading is
more complex than it is usually understood and can not be solely discussed
through the trading activity. The characteristic time of the Epps eﬀect seems
to be independent of the trading frequency, indicating another, possibly hu-
man time scale being also at play. This assumption, together with an analytic
treatment of the Epps eﬀect and with Monte Carlo experiments will be in-
vestigated in a forthcoming paper [16].

Inspired by studies on the airports’ network and the physical Internet we propose a general
model of transportation networks via an optimization principle. The optimal network turns out

characterized by a strongly heterogeneous traﬃc, non-trivial correlations between distance and traﬃc
and a broadly distributed centrality. A clear hierarchical organization, with local hubs distributing
traﬃc in smaller regions, emerges as a result of the optimization. Varying the parameters of the
cost function, diﬀerent classes of trees are recovered, including in particular the minimum spanning
tree and the shortest path tree. These results suggest that a variational approach represents an
alternative and possibly very meaningful path to the study of the structure of complex (weighted)
networks.

Transportation and communication infrastructures
such as the airports’ network and the physical Inter-
net are characterized by broad distributions of traf-
ﬁc, betweenness centrality and in some case also of
degree. Strong, non-linear traﬃc-distance and traﬃc-
connectivity correlations have also been reported [1, 2, 3].
Modelization attempts with ingredients such as random
weights, dynamical rules or weight-topology coupled dy-
namics (see eg. [2] and ref. therein) have mainly focused
on growth processes. Variational approaches have in-
stead been largely disregarded although they frequently
provide an alternative and possibly more meaningful
point of view.

Both the problem of optimal traﬃc [4] on a network
and the problem of optimal networks [5] have a long tra-

for example that the laws that describe the ﬂow of cur-
rents in a resistor network [6] can be derived by mini-
mizing the energy dissipated by the network [7]. On the
other hand, optimal networks have shown to be relevant
in the study of mammalians circulatory system [8], food
webs [9], general transportation networks [10], metabolic
rates [11] and river networks [12]. It has been recently
argued that they are also important for infrastructures
and distribution networks such as gas pipelines or train
tracks [13]. All these studies share the fact that the
nodes of the network are embedded in a d-dimensional
euclidean space which implies that the degree is almost
always limited and the connections restricted to ‘neigh-
bours’ only. A second broad class of optimal networks
where spatial constraints are absent has been also re-
cently investigated. It has been shown, for example, that
optimization of both the average shortest path and the
total length can lead to small-world networks [14], and
more generally, degree correlations [15] or scale-free fea-
tures [16] can emerge from an optimization process. Can-

cho and Sole [17] showed that the minimization of the
average shortest path and the link density leads to a va-
riety of networks including exponential-like graphs and
scale-free networks. Finally, Colizza et al. [18] studied
networks with the shortest route and the smallest con-
gestion and showed that this interplay could lead to a
variety of networks when the number of links per node is
changed.

In this paper mostly inspired by studies on airports’
networks [1], we ﬁrst investigate an hybrid, although im-
portant case of optimal networks, in which nodes are em-
bedded in a 2-dimensional plane but links are not con-
strained (as for air routes) to connect ‘neighbours’. We
propose a general cost function that depends both on the
length and the traﬃc carried by the links and show that
the resulting optimal network is hierarchically organized
and displays a complex traﬃc structure.

We consider a set of N points (airports) randomly dis-
tributed in a square of unitary area and would like to
build a network (air routes) that connects all points.
The cost or weigth wij associated to ‘traveling’ along
j is a function of both the length dij of the
a link i
link and of the traﬃc tij it carries. The tij,
in the
air-network analogy, represent the number of passengers
and is symmetric tij = tji. To travel from a generic
node i0 to another generic node ip along a speciﬁc path
the cost to be paid is the sum of
i0, i1, i2, . . . , ip−1, ip

the weights wk,k+1 associated to the links that compose
the path, and when more than one path is available we
assume that the most economical one is chosen

Our purpose is therefore to ﬁnd the traﬃc

T = Pi<j ti,j is ﬁxed.
In this paper, we choose as
the weight of a link e the ratio of its length to traﬃc:
we = de/te. Although this choice is not the most gen-
eral, it naturally veriﬁes the expectation that the weigth
is an increasing function of dij and a decreasing one of
tij. This last condition can be easily understood in the
case of transportation networks and means that it is more
economic to travel on links with a large traﬃc, reducing
the eﬀective distance of the connection.

We search for the minimum-realizing traﬃc using a
Monte-Carlo algorithm. The elementary move consists
in transferring a random fraction of the traﬃc carried by
a link to another one. The minimum-cost path between
two points is recalculated at any step with Djikstra’s al-
gorithm [5]. We start with the topology of the complete
graph and as we show below the optimal solution is char-
acterized by a majority of links that carry no traﬃc and
allows the emergence of a non trivial topology. The op-
timal network results then as the compromise of two op-
posing forces: the need for short routes and the traﬃc
concentration on as few paths as possible. The interplay
between topology and traﬃc naturally induces the ob-
served correlations between degree, distance and traﬃc
itself.

The optimal network being a tree enormously simpli-

path exists between any two nodes in a tree, the energy

we have an interplay between centralization and minimum

dominates over distance and a ‘star’ structure emerges with a

We expect to obtain something very diﬀerent from the
classical (Euclidean-) minimum spanning tree [5] since
our energy involves a combination of metric (the dis-
tance) and topological (the betweenness) quantities. The
expression Eq. (4) suggests an interesting generalization
given by the optimization of

where µ and ν control the relative importance of dis-

shows examples of spanning trees obtained for diﬀerent
values of (µ, ν). For (µ, ν) = (0, 1) one obtains the Eu-
clidean Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) [Fig. (1a)] which

Pe we and gives a traﬃc te = T √de/ P √de. For
(µ, ν) = (1/2, 1/2) we obtain the OTT [Fig. (1b)] which
displays an interesting interplay between distance and
shortest path minimization (see below). For (µ, ν) =
(1, 1), the energy is proportional to the average short-
est weighted path (with weights equal to euclidean dis-
tance [Fig. (1c)]. When (µ, ν) = (1, 0), the energy (5) is
proportional to the average betweenness centrality and
therefore to the average shortest path Pe be
ℓ. The
tree (1, 0) shown in Fig. (1d) is thus the shortest path
tree (SPT) with an arbitrary “star-like” hub (a small
non zero value of ν would select as the star the closest
node to the gravity center). The minimization of Eq. (5)
thus provides a natural interpolation between the MST
and the SPT, a problem which was addressed in previous
studies [21]. The degree distribution for all cases consid-
ered above [with the possible exception (µ, ν) = (1, 1)]
is not broad, possibly as a consequence of spatial con-
straints. A complete inspection of the plane (µ, ν) is left
for future studies.

It has been shown that trees can be classiﬁed in ‘uni-
versality classes’ [22, 23] according to the distribution of
the sizes of the two parts in which a tree can be divided by
removing a link (or the distribution of sub-basins areas,
in the language of river network). We deﬁne Ai and Aj as
the sizes of the two parts in which a generic tree is divided

the distributions of A′s and b′s can be easily derived one
from the other. It is therefore not surprising that the ex-
ponent δ = 4/3 of the Minimum Spanning Tree [22] also

characterizes the distribution P (b)
ever that a random spanning tree (µ, ν) = (0, 0) displays
δ = 3/2 to be compared with δ = 11/8 [23] when only
‘short’ connections are present). In contrast, for the OTT
we obtain an exponent δ
2, a value also obtained for
trees grown with preferential attachment mechanism [24]
(see also [25] for a supporting argument). Interestingly,
most real-world networks are also described by this value
δ
2 [3]. The OTT thus tends to have a more uniform
centrality with respect to the MST [26], with important
consequences on the vulnerability of the network since
there is no clearly designated ‘Achille’s heel’ for the OTT.

We now investigate the traﬃc properties of the OTT.
Fig. 3 displays the traﬃc on an edge versus its length
and shows that large traﬃc is carried over large distance
and is then dispatched on smaller hubs that distribute
it on still smaller regions. Despite the small range of
degrees, we observe for the strength [1] si = Pj tij a
behavior consistent with a power law s
≈
1.5. This result demonstrates the existence of degree-
traﬃc correlations can emerge from a global optimization
process.

FIG. 3: Binned plot of the traﬃc on an edge tij versus its
length dij for the OTT (obtained for N = 104 and 100 con-
ﬁgurations). Large links carry large traﬃc and the increase
follows a power law with exponent of order 1.5.

The OTT displays (Fig. 4) a hierarchical spatial organi-
zation where long links connect regional hubs, that, in
turn are connected to sub-regional hubs, etc. This hier-
archical structure can be probed by measuring the av-
erage euclidean distance between nodes belonging to the
cluster obtained by deleting recursively the longest link.
For the OTT (Fig. 5), we observe a decrease of the region
size, demonstrating that longer links connect smaller re-
gions, a feature absent in non-hierarchical networks such
as the MST, the shortest path tree or the random tree
(Fig. 5).

In summary, we showed that the emergence of com-
plex structure in traﬃc organization could be explained
by an optimization principle. In particular, strong cor-
relations between distance and traﬃc arise naturally as
a consequence of optimizing the average weighted short-
est path. In the optimal network, long-range links carry
large traﬃc and connect regional hubs dispatching traﬃc
on a smaller scale ensuring an eﬃcient global distribu-
tion. These results suggest that the organization of the

traﬃc on complex networks and more generally architec-
ture of weighted networks could in part result from an
evolutionary process. Finally, this study led us to pro-
pose a generalization of the usual minimum spanning tree
by introducing the centrality and allows to interpolate
from the MST to the shortest path tree. This general-
ization however deserves further studies and raises inter-
esting question such as the crossover from diﬀerent tree
universality classes.

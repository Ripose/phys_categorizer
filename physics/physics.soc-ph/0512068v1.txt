Abstract

We present analytical and numerical results of modeling of ﬂows represented
as the correlated non-Poissonian point process and as the Poissonian sequence
of pulses of the diﬀerent size. Both models may generate signals with the power-
law distributions of the intensity of the ﬂow and the power-law spectral density.
Furthermore, diﬀerent distributions of the interevent time of the point process
and diﬀerent statistics of the size of pulses may result in 1/f β noise with 0.5 .
β . 2. Combination of the models is applied for modeling of the Internet traﬃc.

1 Introduction

Modeling and simulations enable one to understand and explain the observable phe-
nomena and predict the new ones. This is true, as well, for the mathematical study and
modeling of the traﬃc ﬂow with the aim to get a better understanding of phenomena
and avoid some problems of traﬃc congestion. Traﬃc phenomena are complex and
nonlinear, they show cluster formation, huge ﬂuctuations and long-range dependen-
cies. Almost forty years ago from the empirical data it was detected that ﬂuctuations
of a traﬃc current on a expressway obey the 1/f law for low spectral frequencies [1].
Similarly 1/f noise is observable in the ﬂows of granular materials [2, 3].

1/f noise, or 1/f ﬂuctuations are usually related with the power-law distributions
of other statistics of the ﬂuctuating signals, ﬁrst of all with the power-law decay of
autocorrelations and the long-memory processes (see, e.g., comprehensive bibliography
of 1/f noise in the website [4], review articles [5, 6] and references in the recent paper
[7]). The appearance of the clustering and large ﬂuctuations in the traﬃc and granular
ﬂows may be a result of synchronization of the nonlinear systems with stopping and
driven by common noise, resulting in the nonchaotic behavior of the Brownian-type
motions, intermittency and 1/f noise [8, 9].

The traﬃc and granular ﬂows usually may be considered as those consisting of
the discrete identical objects such as vehicles, pedestrians, granules, packets and so
on, they may be represented as consisting of pulses or elementary events and further

1

simpliﬁed to the point process model [7, 10–12]. Moreover, from the modeling of the
traﬃc it was found that 1/f noise may be the result of clustering and jumping [10]
similar to the point process model of 1/f noise [7, 11, 12].

On the other hand, 1/f noise may be conditioned by the ﬂow consisting of uncorre-
lated pulses of variable size with the power-law distribution of the pulse durations [13].
In the Internet traﬃc the ﬂow of the signals primarily is composed of the power-law
distributed ﬁle sizes. The ﬁles are divided by the network protocol into the equal pack-
ets [14]. Therefore, the total incoming web traﬃc is a sequence of the packets arising
from large number of requests. Such a ﬂow exhibits 1/f ﬂuctuations, as well [14, 15].
The long-range correlations and the power-law ﬂuctuations in the wide range of the
time scale from minutes to months of the expressway traﬃc ﬂow have recently been
observed and investigated using the method of the detrended ﬂuctuation analysis [16].
There are no explanations why the traﬃc ﬂow exhibit 1/f noise behavior in such a
large interval of the time.

It is the purpose of this paper to present analytical and numerical results for the
modeling of ﬂows represented as sequences of diﬀerent pulses and as a correlated
non-Poissonian point process resulting in 1/f noise and to apply these results to the
modeling of the Internet traﬃc.

2 Signal as a sequence of pulses

We will investigate a signal of ﬂow consisting of a sequence of pulses,

I(t) =

Ak(t − tk).

Here the function Ak(t − tk) represents the shape of the k pulse having inﬂuence on
the signal I(t) in the region of time tk.

2.1 Power spectral density

The power spectral density of the signal (1) can be written as

S(f ) = lim

(2)

where ω = 2πf , T = tf − ti ≫ ω−1 is the observation time and the brackets h. . .i
denote the averaging over realizations of the process. We assume that pulse shape
functions Ak(u) decrease suﬃciently fast when |u| → ∞. Since T → ∞, the bounds
of the integration in Eq. (2) can be changed to ±∞.

When the time moments tk are not correlated with the shape of the pulse Ak, the

power spectrum is [2]

2.2 Stationary process

Equation (6) can be further simpliﬁed for the stationary process. Then all averages
can depend only on k − k′, i.e.,

Ψk,k′(ω) ≡ Ψk−k′(ω)

χk,k′(ω) ≡ χk−k′(ω).

Equation (6) then reads

2.3 Fixed shape pulses

When the shape of the pulses is ﬁxed (k-independent) then the function Ψk,k′(ω) does
not depend on k and k′ and, therefore, Ψk,k′(ω) = Ψ0,0(ω). Then equation (6) yields

3 Stochastic point processes

The shapes of the pulses mainly inﬂuence the high frequency power spectral density,
i.e., at ω ≥ 1/∆tp, with ∆tp being the characteristic pulse length. Therefore the power
spectral density at low frequencies for the not very long pulses is mainly conditioned
by the correlations between the transit times tk, i.e., the signal may be approximated
by the point process.

The point process model of 1/f β noise has been proposed [11, 12], generalized [7],
analysed and used for the ﬁnancial systems [17]. It has been shown that when the
average interpulse, interevent, interarrival, recurrence or waiting times τk = tk+1 − tk
of the signal diﬀuse in some interval, the power spectrum of such process may exhibit
the power-law dependence, Sδ(f ) ∼ 1/f β, with 0.5 . β . 2. The distribution density
of the signal (15) intensity deﬁned as I = 1/τk may be of the power-law, P (I) ∼ I −λ,
with 2 6 λ 6 4, as well. The exponents β and λ are depending on the manner of
diﬀusion-like motion of the interevent time τk and, e.g., for the multiplicative process
are interrelated [7, 17]. For the pure multiplicative process [7]

β = 1 + α,

λ = 3 + α,

(16)

where α is the exponent of the power-law distribution, Pk(τk) ∼ τ α
k , of the interevent
time. In general, for relatively slow ﬂuctuations of τk, the distribution density of the
ﬂow I,

P (I) ∼ Pk(I −1)I −3,
(17)
is mostly conditioned by the multiplier I −3. As far as the point process model has
recently [7, 17] been analysed rather properly here we will not repeat the analysis and
only present some new illustrations.

of the power spectra S(f ), (c), for diﬀerent point processes with the slow diﬀusion-like
motion of the average interevent time. Diﬀerent symbols correspond to diﬀerent types
of the generation of the interevent sequences.

Figure 1 demonstrates that for essentially diﬀerent distributions of τk, the power

spectra and distribution densities of the point processes are similar.

Further we proceed to the ﬂow consisting of the pulses of diﬀerent durations and

application of this approach for modeling of the Internet traﬃc.

4 Flow consisting of pulses of variable duration

When the occurrence times tk of the pulses are uncorrelated and distributed according
to the Poisson process, the power spectrum of the random pulse train is given by the
Carlson’s theorem

is the Fourier transform of the pulse Ak. Suppose that the random parameters of the
pulses are the duration and the area (integral) of the pulse. We can take the form of

where

(cid:18)

where Tk is the characteristic duration of the pulse. The value of the exponent ρ =
0 corresponds to the ﬁxed height but diﬀerent durations, the telegraph-like pulses,
whereas ρ = −1 corresponds to constant area pulses but of diﬀerent heights and
durations, and so on.

For the power-law distribution of the pulse durations,

(23)

Therefore, the random pulses with the appropriate distribution of the pulse duration
(and area) may generate signals with the power-law distribution of the spectrum with
diﬀerent slopes. So, the pure 1/f noise generates, e.g., the ﬁxed area (ρ = −1) with
the uniform distribution of the durations (δ = 0) sequences of pulses, the ﬁxed height
(ρ = 0) with the uniform distribution of the inverse durations γ = T −1
and all other
sequences of random pulses satisfying the condition δ + 2ρ = −2.

In such a case from Eq. (23) we have

5 The Internet traﬃc

In this Section we will apply the results of the Section 4 for modeling the Internet
traﬃc. The incoming traﬃc consists of sequence of packets, which are the result of
the division of the requested ﬁles by the network (TCP) protocol. Maximum size of
the packet is 1500 bytes. Therefore, the information signal is as the point process (15)
with the pulse area a = 1500 bytes. Further, we will analyse the ﬂow of the packets
and will measure the intensity of the ﬂow in packets per second. In such a system of
units in Eq. (15) we should put a = 1.

We exploit the empirical observation [14, 18] that the distribution of the ﬁle sizes

x may be described by the positive Cauchy distribution

(20)

(21)

(24)

(25)

P (x) =

with the empirical parameter s = 4100 bytes. This distribution asymptotically exhibits
the Pareto distribution and follows the Zipf’s law P (X > x) ∼ 1/x. The ﬁles are
divided by the network protocol into packets of the maximum size of 1500 bytes or
less. In the Internet traﬃc the packets spread into the Poissonian sequence with the
average inter-packet time τp (see Fig. 2). The total incoming ﬂow of the packets to
the server consists of the packets arising from the Poissonian request of the ﬁles with
the average interarrival time of ﬁles τf .

The ﬁles are requested from diﬀerent servers located at diﬀerent distance. This
results in the distribution of the average inter-packet time τp in some interval. For
reproduction of the empirical distribution of the interpacket time τk we assume the
uniform distribution of lg τk in some interval [τk,min, τk,max], similarly to the McWhorter
model of 1/f noise [7]. As a result, the presented model reproduces suﬃciently well the
observable non-Poissonian distribution of the arrival interpacket times and the power
spectral density, as well (see Fig. 3).

6 Conclusion

In the paper it was shown that the processes exhibiting 1/f noise and the power-law
distribution of the intensity may be generated starting from the signals as sequences
of constant area pulses with the correlated appearance times as well as of diﬀerent
size Poissonian pulses. Combination of both approaches enables the modeling of the
signals in the Internet traﬃc.

Abstract

We make a short route by history and evolution of the scientiﬁc
publications, in order to explain the paper that could carry out the
e-Prints servers in a future not very distant, raising therefore a scien-
tiﬁc publication scheme via digital network and the new publication
dynamics.

1 Introducci´on

The present time the communication via digital network (email, e-
Print server, web sites, FTP, chat, etc.) has become a vital tool
for the development of the scientiﬁc researches. Now is possible to
communicate in less than 24 hours to the scientiﬁc community any
development or investigation that is considered of importance, in the
same way we can accede to investigations and works published in the
day. Now it’s not necessary that we hope months to read an article
published in a journal, this without telling that not always it’s possible
to consult any journal printed anywhere of the world. Additionally
there are no restrictions to the size of a document, then it’s possible
to show a work with greater detail, even of an interactive way and
to a very low cost; thus it’s since the scientiﬁc communications have
evolved.

2 History and Evolution of Scientiﬁc
Publications

If we began in century XVII, we can observe that the intellectual in-
terchange occurred initially through personal letters, manuscripts or
dice the case; messengers. Science is being born and the understood
ones in the subject are few, this causes that the messenger is a science
man. For example, the Fermat work over the theory of probabilities is
known thanks to the correspondence that he had with Pascal, or the
letters that sent Pascal to Carcavi in which it ﬁnds the length of arc
of a cycloid, or famous the last theorem of Fermat that is known by
an footnote in a manuscript [1].

Otherwise, it was due to the development of the press (half of
century XV) that could be guaranteed the diﬀusion of the knowl-
edge, which gave an impulse him to the intellectual production.
It
was thanks to the press that in ﬁrst half of century XVII Galileo
Galilei could spread its manuscript ”Dialogue Concerning the Two
Chief World Systems”. Is interesting to remember that Galileo wrote
its manuscripts in dialogue form, which allowed him to arrive at a pub-
lic not so specialized. Soon in second half of century XVII, Newton
would arrive and he would give to a fort impulse him to modern sci-
ence, at the same time the Royal Society would create what would be
the present form to communicate and to validate the scientiﬁc knowl-
edge: the journal. All this caused that the journals were the best form
to communicate and to impel the scientiﬁc development.

At the moment the journals continue being means of diﬀusion and
promotion of the scientiﬁc work with established rules; The published
works must be original and a same article cannot again be published
in another journal. In the same way the responsibility of an investiga-
tion is due to recognize through the cites. In the publication process
the articles must be analyzed and be discussed by experts for their
later publication, which allows to maintain a control on publications.
At the present time it’s spoken of 50,000 annual international publi-
cations in mathematics [2].

Recently, in century XX, with the invention of the telecommunica-
tions and the computers, they appear the online communications, and
in 1961 an experiment that involves the article dissemination based on

2

preprints via IEGs (information Exchange Groups). This service was
supported by NIH (National Institutes of Health) in the USA, which
counted on considered of a 2500 members and 80% of the memos
published in printed journals. The intention of this experiment was
to provide an immediate communication between investigators, which
was ﬁnished the 1 of March of 1967 because: IEG preprints is complete
publications, and this represented a danger for the existing journals
since its use would be reduced. In addition IEG preprints violated the
requirements of many journals since the submissive documents could
not be placed elsewhere [3].

Later in August of 1991 thanks to the eﬀorts of Paul Ginsparg,
a server for the distribution centralized of electronic preprints settled
down itself, based on the National Laboratory of Los Alamos (LANL)
[4], which is counted with the support of APS (American Physics So-
ciety). The initial center was the Theoretical Physics of High Energies
(Hep-th) and given its fast acceptance, extended to many other areas
of the physics, the nonlinear mathematics, and computer sciences. At
the moment e-Print servers (initially called preprint server) is grow-
ing to new areas with more adept and they are not being restricted,
this is the case of arXiv which counts on 18 mirrors, 70% of e-Prints
published in journals and a 20% in conferences [5].

3 e-Print Servers

Perhaps one of the most attractive factors of online publications (around
500 [2]) is that they allow a systematic consultation, then is possible
to accede to the information using search motor and of a selective
form, which saves long time when doing a consultation. Additionally
the physical space in the libraries is optimized, of the same form one
saves the printing and the time when obtaining an article, this without
telling that no longer there are expenses of amount for foreign publi-
cations. The slogan is: “single it’s printed what it’s used”. Otherwise
the costs of an electronic publishing and their access are low, where a
library (books, journals, etc.) for an institution can have a cost from
1/4 to 1/3 of the total of the expenses of this [6]. But they are perhaps
the servers of e-Prints the most desired by the academic community
due to his low cost of maintenance and article publication [7], in ad-

3

dition the access to publications is free; arXiv is a good example of
these. This is not something isolated within electronic surroundings,
we can see the case of Linux, an operating system of free access that
is has more adept; or the Napster phenomenon, which allowed to have
free access to music; the impact of Google, given its eﬃciency in the
search web and its little publicity, etc.

Here single it interests e-Print server, which have generated ev-
ery time a greater publicity, proliferation and intellectual interchange,
maximizing the impact, speed and progress of scientiﬁc development.
It’s as well as one of the works of Maldacena [hep-th/9711200] based
initially during 10 months in LANL, was one of the most mentioned
in 1998 with 456 citations, or one of the works of Polchinski [hep-
th/9611050] which has remained by more than 4 years as e-Print with
688 citations (see [8]). This shows the impact of works based on e-
Print server.

One of the most diﬃcult problems is the costs when it’s spoken
to publish, and considering the beneﬁts before mentioned of the elec-
tronic format, the publications have been forced to change itself or
to maintain a online version to promote the intellectual production.
This has entailed to that some journals adapt quickly, between some:
Physics Review Letters (PRL) [9], The Journal of High Energy Physics
(JHEP) [10] (Pioneering in totally electronic journals of investigation
in physics), Mathematical Physics Electronic Journal (MPEJ) [11],
Central PubMed [12], the three last of free totally access. On the
other hand, the costs are those that determine if a online publication
is or not of free access, and since it’s not possible to accede to all ex-
isting literature in the countries nondeveloped by his costs, then the
competitive investigation is restricted in them, where the theoretical
work even can be competitive.

A determining factor for the promotion of the scientiﬁc work is
perhaps the access to the information, and even plus the access to
information of good quality, which can be recognized by its innova-
tion, rigor and its technological applications, or given the case by its
pedagogical or epistemologic content. The access to the information
is something that easily the electronic means obtain, now is possible
to maintain communication through email, e-Print server, web sites,
chat or forums with experts, this without greater diﬃculty. Neverthe-

4

less at the present time journals electronic or e-Print server, they have
the same inherited primary characteristic of their precesores, and is
that single they contain text and images. Perhaps in a next future
nonsingle it will be fundamental what it’s written also will be im-
portant as one appears (remember the Galileo work), the multimedia
will be useful at the moment of arriving at a public nonspecialized [13].

Of another way, when we review the statistics that correlate ar-
ticles cited with their publication in journals free or not free[14], we
ﬁnd that the citation dynamics diminishes when the journals let be of
free access. Here, we show the annual citation dinamics of some most
cited papers in high energy physics until year 2001 according to SLAC
database. Then are: #6 cited 2696 times, #9 cited 2447 times, #10
cited 2369 times, and #11 cited 2309 times (see SPIRES [8]).

This database include papers published in journals and e-Print
servers, which can be observed that the citation dynamics for these
articles changes after the year 1991, in was established the server of
preprint in Los Alamos. Given the previous commentaries, it’s pos-
sible to ask if the journals continue being an suitable format for the
promotion and diﬀusion of the intellectual work.

4 A Possibility to the Future Scientiﬁc
Communications

When a work is published by a journal, this means that an idea or an
investigation has been registered, and that a group of experts endorses
and support the investigation. At the same time an investigation to
the scientiﬁc community communicates (which implies to have access
to this), this is very well obtained by e-Print server. On the other
hand, if the citation dynamics considers within the scientiﬁc commu-
nity, it’s deduced that an article acquires relevance and a status when
this it’s endorsed and cited in other works, and by other investigators;
it’s to say when is useful to others. Therefore a work with publication
e-Print acquires the same status of a publication done by a journal
at the moment that is cited by somebody diﬀerent one from autor(s),
where the impact of e-Print would be moderate by your number of
citations and who cites this work (this last one is not novel and is
something that always has been implicit within the social dynamics
of the scientist community).

Although the process of selection in e-Print server is minimum,
this system could work if a good culture of scientiﬁc communication
is acquired [13], which would beneﬁt to all. For example, one of the
frequent vices of the scientiﬁc investigator; it’s to publish to publish
(see also other commentaries in [15]). The same author is who would
have to make his work valid and to select the publishable and what is
not publishable. The investigator must remember that when submit
a article, it is the name of the author which is in game and this is
decisive if it’s interested in that their work is recognized, important
at the moment for asking support to make investigation.

Otherwise e-Print server has been like a system that recognizes
the responsibility of a work, in where it’s possible to ﬁnd the source
easily of documents (tex, txt, html, etc.) and this is something that
does not worry. The plagiarism of ideas or the presence of saboteurs
(for example: to supplant a name, etc.) is something not seen and the
scientists are communicating their ideas almost very instantaneously,
with the conﬁdence of which its investigation is recognized (remenber
the works of Maldacena and Polchinski). It’s as well as some recog-
nized physicists who work in the area of High Energy of Physics have
begun to use single the archives e-Print and less the journals, today

6

it’s common to ﬁnd citations to works that have single publication in
e-Print server.

We are giving much importance to the citations, and is possible
to ask as to establish the status of an article according to its cita-
tions. A good method for the article classiﬁcation would be to use a
directed graph (to see [16]), which is deﬁned as it follows: Given two
articles represented by the nodes A, B, we say that A is connected B
(A → B) if A cites to B. In addition we considered the weight of B
like the number iB of connections to B, is to say the number of times
that B is cited, in such a way that the citations made by the same
group of authors or a sub-group from this are excluded. This graph
can partially be ordered using its weights, where the smallest weight
is zero and greatest some natural number n 6= 0. One says that two
nodes A, B are connected (A 7→ B) if it’s possible to ﬁnd a way that
it connects A with B (ej A → Q → J → M → B), and a node C
is essential ( ˆC ) if it’s a forced node of the A 7→ B way. A graph is
connected if it does not have essential nodes, is to say if the graph
does not contain articles that connect isolated subjects.

Using the previous scheme of connected graph or some other, we
could to measure the acceptance and the impact of e-Print, being used
the weights ix of each node, in such a way that e-Print acquires the
status of a published article if it has a weight diﬀerent from zero. On
the other hand to take a statistic of the scientiﬁc production, is some-
thing that the electronic media can do without greater diﬃculty, you
can see for example in Physics, Mathematics and Computer sciences
the database of SPIRES-HEP [8] or Citeseer [17] respectively.

At the moment, the journals will continue being a control mecha-

nism and consultation and diﬀusion of works of good quality.

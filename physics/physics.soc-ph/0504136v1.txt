Power law cumulative frequency (P ) vs. event size (l) distributions P (≥ l) ∼ l−α are frequently
cited as evidence for complexity and serve as a starting point for linking theoretical models and
mechanisms with observed data. Systems exhibiting this behavior present fundamental mathemat-
ical challenges in probability and statistics. The broad span of length and time scales associated
with heavy tailed processes often require special sensitivity to distinctions between discrete and
continuous phenomena. A discrete Highly Optimized Tolerance (HOT) model, referred to as the
Probability, Loss, Resource (PLR) model, gives the exponent α = 1/d as a function of the dimension
d of the underlying substrate in the sparse resource regime. This agrees well with data for wildﬁres,
web ﬁle sizes, and electric power outages. However, another HOT model, based on a continuous
(dense) distribution of resources, predicts α = 1 + 1/d. In this paper we describe and analyze a
third model, the cuts model, which exhibits both behaviors but in diﬀerent regimes. We use the
cuts model to show all three models agree in the dense resource limit. In the sparse resource regime,
the continuum model breaks down, but in this case, the cuts and PLR models are described by the
same exponent.

I. INTRODUCTION

In this paper we analyze a family of abstract, mathe-
matical models which have been used to illustrate Highly
Optimized Tolerance (HOT) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], a mecha-
nism for complexity based on robustness tradeoﬀs in sys-
tems subject to uncertain environments. HOT systems
abound in nature and modern technology, and are com-
plex and highly structured. They arrive at “optimized”
or “organized” states through deliberate design or bio-
logical evolution, and exhibit robust, yet fragile (RYF)
characteristics, the essence of HOT. That is, they are ro-
bust to normal or common perturbations, yet may be ex-
tremely fragile to rare perturbations or design ﬂaws, even
if the perturbations are small and seemingly innocuous.
Recently, HOT has been investigated in the context
of a variety of speciﬁc applications, including the Inter-
net [7, 8], the Electric Power Grid [9], Wildﬁres [10], and
Biological Networks [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. Typi-
cally, these studies involve a combination of simple ab-
stract, analytically tractable representations, which focus
on fundamental tradeoﬀs and derivations of the power
laws, with detailed, high-resolution simulation models,
aimed at pinpointing speciﬁc system and model fragili-
ties. Here we focus speciﬁcally on the abstract models
which have been used to describe HOT. We compare dis-
crete and continuum models in a common framework,
and clarify the approximations that are made and the
ranges of applicability of the models. This forces us to ad-
dress certain fundamental issues in probability and statis-
tics, including distinctions between discrete and contin-
uous distributions, and properties associated with mix-
tures of distributions.

One key success of HOT is to oﬀer an alternative per-
spective on the origins and ubiquity of complexity, and

particularly power laws. Mathematically, heavy tailed
distributions (e.g. power laws) often require special care
because of the broad range of spatial and temporal scales
over which data is sampled [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]. In
many cases, conventional assumptions and methodolo-
gies associated with modeling and data analysis are mis-
leading and/or break down. One of the goals of this
paper is to illustrate how such problems can arise, and
to approach them in a manner which is mathematically
rigorous.

HOT has been compared to earlier work emphasiz-
ing emergent complexity, where power laws arise from
minimal tuning, on an otherwise random substrate. In
emergent complexity power laws are associated with frac-
tals and self-similarity [24, 25]. In many studies, HOT
illustrates the diﬀerences between organized and emer-
gent complexity by using percolation forest ﬁre models
from physics [26, 27, 28], but including a minimal form
of optimization (intended to capture design or evolution)
and robustness tradeoﬀs [1, 2, 5, 6, 29]. This produces
power laws (in better agreement with data) that arise
from highly organized and self-dissimilar structures, the
opposite of self-similarity.

All of the abstract HOT models follow the same basic
mechanistic description involving optimization of trade-
oﬀs in an uncertain environment. Each begins with a
d-dimensional substrate representing the system. Each
event (e.g., a power outage or ﬁre) is triggered by some
small perturbation or spark (typically chosen from a
nonuniform distribution) which initiates a cascading fail-
ure, resulting in loss of some portion of the substrate. All
of the models considered here assume the loss (or cost)
associated with an event scales linearly with the event
size. Alternative cost functions give power laws in cost,
not necessarily raw event size [1]. Thus cost functions

that heavily weight large events can lead to truncation
of the power laws [6].

In HOT, resources are allocated to create barriers lim-
iting propagation of the cascading failure events in a
manner which optimizes the cost function (minimizing
loss or maximizing yield). There is a limited number of
resources available, and this constraint is modeled in one
of two ways. The ﬁrst method places a ﬁxed limit on the
total resources available. The second weights resource
use alongside other costs or losses, which are associated
with the events themselves, by including an explicit re-
source term in the cost function. Here the key issue is to
account explicitly for resource use. The speciﬁc form of
the constraint does not play a signiﬁcant role in deter-
mining the size distribution.

In HOT, optimization of the resource allocations sub-
ject to the constraint represents design and/or evolu-
tionary tradeoﬀs in systems faced with a spectrum of
disturbances. Because resources are constrained and of-
ten sparse or expensive, optimal solutions make eﬃcient
use of the resources available, resulting in HOT states
characterized by structured, compact, d-dimensional re-
gions surrounded by (d−1)-dimensional barriers. In ad-
dition, for a broad class of distributions of disturbances
(e.g. Gaussian, exponential, and Cauchy), minimization
of the average loss results in heavy-tailed, power law dis-
tributions in the sizes of the events. Newman et al. [6]
emphasize however that the speciﬁc exponents charac-
terizing the decay of the power law distribution in HOT
models can be diﬀerent.

In this paper we focus on three models for HOT which
are among the simplest, and most analytically tractable
examples. Table I summarizes their basic properties,
which will be described in detail in the following sections.
In each case,

• Probability p: represents uncertainty in the envi-

ronment.

• Loss l: represents the volume or size associated
with an individual event, which is directly propor-
tional to the cost of that event.

• Resources r: provide mechanisms to limit losses.

• Constraints: are imposed on the resources.

• Optimization: of the resource assignments subject

to constraints leads to the HOT state.

• Power Laws: in the cumulative event distributions,
l, are characteristic of these optimal

P (≥ l) vs.
solutions.

All of these models are motivated by studies of the HOT
version of the percolation forest ﬁre model [1, 2]. The
most well studied of these are the continuum model [1],
generalized by Newman et. al. [6], and the Probability

2

Loss Resource (PLR) [3] model. Their abstractions dif-
fer in subtle, yet important ways, leading to diﬀerences
in the predictions. The continuum model aims to de-
scribe the continuum limit of the HOT percolation forest
ﬁre model [1], building on lattice models from statistical
physics [27, 30], and introducing a mean-ﬁeld-like anal-
ysis of the continuum limit. In the continuum model all
aspects of the system are described as smoothly varying
functions on the substrate. The PLR model is a general-
ization of Shannon Source Coding Theory [31] from Infor-
mation Theory [32], perhaps the simplest design model in
engineering. The PLR model begins with discrete event
categories i, each of which has a characteristic proba-
bility, resource allocation, and resulting loss. Like the
continuum model, the cuts model [1, 7] can be thought
of as the limiting description of a lattice model as the
lattice size becomes inﬁnite. The cuts model represents
space continuously (like the continuum model) but di-
vides it into discrete regions (like the PLR model) using
sharp barriers, i.e. cuts.

TABLE I: The HOT continuum, PLR, and cuts models pre-
dict power laws based on optimal allocation of limited re-
sources to minimize loss in an uncertain environment. Diﬀer-
ent assumptions in the continuum and PLR models lead to
diﬀerent exponents in the dense and sparse resource regimes,
both of which can arise as (opposite) limits of the cuts model.
The PLR model can be extended to the dense resource limit
(Section V), where it agrees with the continuum and cuts
model. The PLR cumulative probability P (≥ l) assumes
densely sampled data (Section III). To increase readability,
constant factors are set to unity in the equations for Yield Y
which is optimized.

A key distinction between the models is their predic-
tions for power law exponents. The continuum model
predicts a power law in P (≥ l) with exponent α = 1/d+1,
while PLR predicts an exponent of α = 1/d for the same
distribution of sparks (assuming densely sampled data).
We show the ﬁrst two models match solutions in diﬀerent
limits of the cuts model with an exponential distribution
In d = 1 the cuts model predicts an expo-
of sparks.

nent of α = 2 in the limit of small events and α = 1
in the large-event limit. Thus the cuts model captures
the power laws predicted by the other two models in the
limit of small (continuum) and large (PLR) events.

Analysis of the cuts model provides a unifying picture
for all the models, and a concrete illustration of how cer-
tain key approximations made in the ﬁrst two models
can break down. We show that when the PLR and cuts
models have suﬃciently similar assumptions, their results
agree as expected. In the dense resource regime limit (de-
scribed by the continuum model), all three models agree.
The cuts model also illustrates how the exponent describ-
ing small events departs from this dense resource limit as
the density of resources and barriers becomes lower.

In the remaining sections of this paper, we ﬁrst sum-
marize results for the continuum (Section II) and PLR
(Section III) models, with special attention to deriva-
tion of the power laws, and speciﬁc features which will
be useful for comparing models. We also discuss math-
ematical subtleties which can arise in taking continuum
limits in systems with sharp barriers, as well as mathe-
matical issues which can arise in comparing continuum
vs. discrete models and distributions, and distributions
composed of ﬁnite mixtures of probability distributions.
The next three sections comprise the bulk of the new an-
alytical results in this paper.
In Section IV we review
and extend the cuts model and in Section V we compare
it to the other models. We show that the event size dis-
tribution for the PLR and cuts model agrees when their
assumptions are forced to be similar. They also both
agree with the continuum model in the limit of dense re-
sources and small event sizes. For the cuts model with
a power law distribution of sparks, the small event limit
is described by a power law in which the exponent de-
pends on the distribution of sparks, ranging from the
limiting value of α = 2 (which we obtain for an expo-
nential spark density) for an inﬁnitely steep power law,
to α = 1 (sparse resource limit, and in agreement with
PLR) when p(x) ∼ 1/x. Furthermore, for both expo-
nential and power law distributions of sparks, we ﬁnd
that the event size distribution for the cuts model agrees
with the PLR model in the limit of large event sizes,
where the distribution is clearly discrete. In this case the
agreement between models depends on the assumption
of a suﬃciently well sampled data set, which would only
arise in the cuts and PLR models due to mixtures. In
Section VI we return to the original HOT lattice model,
and illustrate a subtle pathology which arises in the con-
tinuum limit of the lattice model in the absence of an

conclude with a discussion of our results, and the rele-
vance of the diﬀerent resource regimes in the context of
observed data.

ﬁrebreak, or cut, labeled ci.

II. CONTINUUM MODEL

The continuum model was ﬁrst suggested as an approx-
imate limiting description of the HOT forest ﬁre perco-
lation lattice model by Carlson and Doyle [1].
It was
later studied alongside large lattice model simulations by
Newman et al. [6]. The deﬁnition of the model most con-
veniently begins with the lattice model, which we will
return to in Section VI. Strictly speaking, the continuum
model is an approximation to the lattice model based on
scaling arguments. It captures the power laws observed
in the HOT lattice model in the limit of large, ﬁnite lat-
tice sizes, and allows the size distribution to be calculated
analytically.

Consider a d−dimensional space, with positions la-
beled by the d−dimensional vector x (these are discrete
sites on a hypercubic lattice, each labeled by d integer
indices i, j, k..., with x = (i/N, j/N, k/N....), where N
is the number of sites along each axis of the lattice).
In the percolation lattice model, each position (site) is
either occupied by a tree, or vacant (ﬁrebreak). Envi-
ronmental uncertainty is represented by the probability
p(x) that a spark lands at site x. A spark ignites a ﬁre
that spreads throughout the nearest neighbor connected
cluster of trees in all d directions, but terminates at ﬁre-
breaks. The resulting ﬁre size is the total number of sites
in the burned patch, l(x), and the value of l(x) is clearly
constant within each contiguous patch. A sample lattice
conﬁguration in the special case d = 1 is illustrated in
Figure 1. Occupied sites (black) are trees and unoccu-
pied sites (white) are ﬁrebreaks. Event sizes li correspond
to the number of occupied spaces between ﬁrebreaks, or
cuts, labeled ci.

HOT conﬁgurations optimize the layout of vacant and
occupied sites to maximize yield Y , deﬁned to be the av-
erage number of occupied sites which remain after a sin-
gle spark lands on the lattice (averaging over the spark
distribution p(x)). For small lattices, it is possible to
compute the globally optimal solution [5]. However, for

large lattices the solution becomes computationally in-
tractable (and not especially informative).
Instead, a
wide variety of constrained optimization schemes have
been investigated [1, 2, 5, 16, 17], all leading to similar
results. Firebreaks are concentrated in regions of high
spark probability, so that only small ﬁres occur in regions
of the lattice where sparks are common, while large ﬁres
occur in regions where sparks are rare.

The specialized, patterned HOT conﬁgurations reﬂect
patterns in the perturbing environment. This is in sharp
contrast to the traditional forest ﬁre percolation model
studied in statistical physics [30], where conﬁgurations
are essentially random, aside from a tuned, or “self-
organized” average critical density [24, 25, 26, 27, 28].
The contrasts between the HOT and self-organized criti-
cal lattice models are discussed in detail in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
and will not be our emphasis here.

The HOT lattice model was the ﬁrst model introduced
to illustrate the HOT mechanism, and is pedagogically
useful in illustrating the emergence of (d − 1)-barriers on
the d−dimensional substrate, as well as the high concen-
trations of barriers in regions where perturbations are
common. All of the other models considered here re-
tain these key features, but each explicitly accounts for
the cost of resources in a diﬀerent way. More impor-
tantly, each makes diﬀerent approximations in represent-
ing continuum versus discrete spatial features of the lat-
tice model, which lead to the diﬀerent predictions for the
event size distribution.

In the continuum model the integer i/N components of
the d−dimensional vector positions x are replaced in the
limit N → ∞ by real valued components. The occupied
(tree) and vacant (ﬁrebreak) lattice sites are replaced by
a resource density r(x), representing the local density of
ﬁrebreaks. A function l(x) represents the size of the loss
which occurs when a spark lands at position x. A key
approximation relative to the original lattice model is
clearly made in the continuum model, which represents
r(x) and l(x) as continuous functions. The idea is to
use a scaling relation, motivated by the lattice model, to
mimic the manner in which higher resource densities lead
to smaller ﬁres in a given region, without accounting in
detail for the speciﬁc conﬁguration.

To derive the distribution of ﬁre sizes for the contin-
uum model, we follow the elegant derivation of Newman
et al. [6]. The size of a ﬁrebreak surrounding a given
patch l(x) is:

r(x) = gdl(x)(d−1)/d,

(1)

where g is a geometric factor of order unity that depends
on the shape of the patch. It is in Eq. (1) that the dimen-
sional relationship between resource and loss is captured.
In the continuum model the total resource use is given
by

FIG. 2: Schematic solution of the continuum model in d = 1.
Small event sizes l(x) are associated with positions x of high
spark probability p(x). Eliminating x and integrating leads
to the event size distribution P (≥ l) as described in the text.
A key distinguishing feature of the continuum model is that
the event size function l(x) is a priori a continuous function
of x.

where the integral is over the d−dimensional substrate.
In the continuum model, this cost enters explicitly into
the yield function. Normalizing Y by the total volume of
the substrate (i.e. Y = 1 corresponds to a fully occupied
forest, with no ﬁres or ﬁrebreaks), and averaging over the
distribution of sparks p(x), we write the expected yield
as

Y = 1 − c

p(x)l(x)dx − aR

(3)

Z

where c is the cost per unit area (or generally, d-
dimensional volume) of forest, and a is the cost per unit
length (or (d−1)-dimensional volume) of ﬁrebreaks. This
yield function is motivated by tradeoﬀs inherent in the
original lattice model, where the resources are empty
sites, and the cost of ﬁrebreaks is the yield penalty in ini-
tial density associated with creation of vacancies. How-
ever, unlike the lattice model, it includes a nonvanish-
ing resource term explicitly in the yield function, and
allows the constants a and c to scale diﬀerently with di-
mension d. This fortuitously omits a pathology which
results from the diﬀerence in scaling between the com-
pact, d−dimensional clusters of trees, and the (d − 1)-
dimensional ﬁrebreaks which arises in the lattice model
as N → ∞. We discuss this in more detail in Section VI.
The optimal allocation of resources r(x) maximizes the
expected yield. Optimizing resources is equivalent to op-
timizing over event sizes because they are explicitly re-
lated via Eq. (1). To obtain the solution, we assume that
l(x) is a continuous function of the ignition site x, and
set the functional derivative δY /δl(x) equal to zero. This
leads to

l(x) = Cp(x)−d/(d+1)

(4)

R =

r(x)dx,

Z

where C is a constant that depends on a,c, and g.

(2)

A schematic solution in d = 1 is illustrated in Figure 2.
It is important to note that the continuum model departs

from the original lattice model in representing l(x) as a
continuous function of x. For a given conﬁguration in
the lattice model, l(x) assumes a constant, ﬁnite value
for each contiguous cluster of occupied sites. Therefore
l(x) in that case, is piecewise constant. The continuum
model represents l(x) as continuous over the entire space,
leading to Eq. (4). It is the only one of the models we
consider which builds in this assumption.

It is also possible to calculate the probability density
ρ(l) of ﬁre sizes for the continuum model. Again, assum-
ing l(x) is continuous we obtain [1, 6]:

Newman et al. thoroughly investigated the behavior of

the factor of l−(2+1/d), while the factor p(x) d

ates at most logarithmic corrections for a broad class of
probability distributions p(x) [6].

d

Since the probability density ρ(l) is continuous, the
cumulative distribution of events of size greater than or
equal to l, P ( ≥ l ), is proportional to l−(1+1/d).
Therefore, for a one dimensional substrate, the contin-
uum model predicts a slope of α = 2 for the cumulative
distribution of events. Table I summarizes the properties
of this model.

III. PROBABILITY LOSS RESOURCE MODEL
(PLR)

The PLR (Probability Loss Resource) HOT model is
a generalization of Shannon Source Coding Theory for
data compression [31], the simplest, most elegant design
theory in engineering.
It is the simplest model illus-
trating HOT [3], and is based on optimal allocation of
limited resources, with an explicit, ﬁxed cap on the to-
tal resources available. It retains a dimension-dependent
relationship between resources ((d − 1)-dimensions) and
loss (d-dimensions), but otherwise replaces the explicit
spatial variable x with a more abstract notion of event
categories i. The idea is to group similar conditions, from
the common to the rare, into a category, represented by
the relative probabilities pi.

The PLR objective is to allocate resources in a manner
which maximizes yield Y averaged over a spectrum of
possible events:

Y = 1 − c

pili| li = f (ri),

ri ≤ R.

(6)

X

Here c is a constant, and i, 1 ≤ i ≤ N , indexes the ﬁ-
nite and discrete set of probabilities pi, assumed to be
in descending order, with corresponding loss li. Normal-
j≥i pj is the rank or-
ized, the cumulative P (≥ li) =
der divided by the total number of events in a data set,

X

P

5

from which corresponding values of pi may be deduced.
We will interpret the pi as probabilities, so Y is average
yield, but in general the pi could be any weights assigned
to create a cost function.

The probability pi of each category is ﬁxed, and a to-
tal resource allocation ri is made to the event category
i, resulting in events of size li for the category (i.e. ri
is the total resource allocation to all the events in event
category i). The ri are chosen to minimize the average
event size, averaged over the spectrum of possible condi-
tions {i}. The only interaction between events is that the
sum of all resources is limited by
ri ≤ R. This means
that any reasonable design will devote more resources to
the categories of common events so that they yield small
losses, leaving relatively few resources for rare events.

P

Unlike explicitly spatial lattice models, the PLR model
presumes a mean-ﬁeld-like independence of events. How-
ever, a lattice abstraction (which should not be inter-
preted as a literal gridding of the forest) can be used to
derive the relationship li = f (ri) between resource alloca-
tion and loss for the event categories {i}. Imagine a large,
ﬁnite d−dimensional lattice which is an abstraction of a
space representing a single condition category i. The lat-
tice is of length L on each side, and the total volume Ld
serves as the large scale cutoﬀ, i.e. the size of the largest
possible event. The value of pi is the total probability
of hitting any part of the lattice for category i, and the
probability of hitting any one of the cells within category
i is equal. Resources ri represent the total allocation of
vacant sites within the ith category.

Because the spark distribution pi is uniform within
each category, the optimal use of resources (vacant sites)
deﬁnes a collection of equally spaced (d − 1)-dimensional
surfaces, one lattice spacing wide in the remaining dimen-
sion, on an otherwise occupied lattice. This deﬁnes a set
of compact, contiguous cells, all of equal size li, for cat-
egory i. For example, in d = 1, the barriers correspond
to a single unoccupied site between contiguous occupied
sites of equal length. This is similar to the lattice shown
in Figure 1, except the occupied regions l1, l2, . . . would
all have the same length.

P

Suppose a resource allocation of size ri =

d Lξ (num-
ber of vacancies) is made to category i, arranged as ξ
equally spaced cuts, spanning the full length of the lat-
tice L in each dimension d. Then the event size li for
category i is li = ((L/ξ) − 1)d. Eliminating ξ yields a
relationship between event size li and the resource allo-
−d. Here L is simply
cation ri, which scales like li ∼ ri
the constant subregion lattice length scale, and the key
result is the dimensional relationship between resource
allocation (to the event category as a whole) and the
corresponding characteristic loss size for that category.

This process is illustrated for d = 1 in Figure 3. Three
event categories (i = 1, 2, 3) are shown, in order of de-
scending probability p1 > p2 > p3. Here the constant
subregion size L is the identical horizontal length of the

which incorporates the scaling determined above, and
uniquely determines f (ri) up to the parameter γ. As in
the original Shannon Theory, we relax the constraint that
the ri take integer values. This is an extremely simple
and tractable model with essentially only one parameter,
the dimension of the substrate, where events are charac-
terized by d−dimensional, compact regions, enclosed by
(d − 1)-dimensional perimeters.

Given a ﬁxed resource budget R, the goal outlined
in Eq. (6) is to optimize the division of resources ri to

where α = 1/d and C is a constant (which depends on
γ, d, and R in Eq. (7)) which sets the small size scale in
the resource vs. loss relationship. For simplicity, we will
assume throughout that C is suﬃciently small that we
can neglect any small size cutoﬀ.

The PLR model is deﬁned in terms of noncumula-
tive probabilities pi, but to reliably compare with data
it is necessary to use cumulative distributions. Since
pi ∝ (li)−(1+α) (Eq. (11)), the naive expectation is that
the cumulative distribution P (≥ li) ∝ (li)−α. However,
this is not necessarily the case for discrete data sets,
where cumulative distributions are attained by summing,
rather than integrating the density. In fact, in the dis-
crete case, the cumulative distribution can be steeper,
shallower, or have the same decay properties as the den-
sity, depending on how densely the data is sampled.
Thus, unlike the case of a continuous probability density,
there is no general relationship between discrete prob-
ability distributions and their noncumulative densities.
We cannot simply assume that since pi(li) is a power law
with slope −(1 + α), that P (≥ li) is a power law, let alone
with slope −α. This issue is fundamental in the theory
of discrete probability distributions, and also arises for
the cuts model (Section IV), which is also inherently dis-
crete), and in comparing PLR with the continuum and
cuts models (Section V).

Furthermore, in making comparisons with data, use of
the density, rather than the distribution does not solve
the problem. Use of the cumulative distribution is in fact
preferable, because it avoids statistical anomalies associ-
ated with binning. The cumulative distribution simply
corresponds to a normalized plot of the ranked (by size)
order of events in a catalog, which does not introduce
any statistical biases.

Although the PLR model can be used to generate a
cumulative event probability function P (≥ l) which is in-
herently discrete, most data sets exhibiting power laws in
the cumulative event probability as a function of size are
suﬃciently dense to exhibit a fairly convincing unit dif-
ference in slope between the density and the cumulative
distribution. This leads us to determine circumstances
under which the naive expectation of unit diﬀerence in
the exponent between the cumulative distribution and
the noncumulative density is in fact correct.

This requires sampling in the data set which is suf-
ﬁciently dense that integration of the density to obtain

the cumulative distribution is a good approximation to
computing the discrete sum. One possible explanation
is to hypothesize that most data sets are mixtures from
many diﬀerent systems, or the same system averaged over
long times. Thus a complete treatment of how to assess
whether data is consistent with a PLR mechanism ulti-
mately requires a treatment of mixtures [33, 34].

The simplest scenario corresponds to a mixture of dis-
crete power law distributions with the same exponent.
This generates a power law with that same exponent,
but possibly diﬀerent short- and large-scale cutoﬀs, and
provides a simple and unambiguous way to connect the
PLR pi ∝ (li)−(1+α) with P (≥ li) ∝ (li)−α. This sce-
nario assumes suﬃcient data up to some cutoﬀ size L,
binned with ﬁxed ∆l, to treat the resulting pi as binned
samples from a continuous density. Then we can deﬁne

P (≥ li) =

(lj + C)−α−1 (lj+1 − lj)

=

(lj + C)−α−1∆l

which in the limit of large data sets approximates a con-

leading to the exponent α = 1 in d = 1. Table I assumes
these properties of the PRL model. Note, however, that
when the PRL model is used and the li are not densely
sampled, then the above calculations for the cumulative
distribution need not hold.

IV. CUTS MODEL

The cuts model [1, 7] is a simple, analytic model that
helps clarify the discrepancy between the power law expo-
nents predicted by the continuum and PLR models. We
focus on d = 1 for this case and the comparisons. Higher
dimensional generalizations of the cuts model are possi-
ble, but correspond to constrained optimization schemes
(e.g. the grid design problem in [1]) or choices of p(x)
with special symmetries. As we show below, the other
two models as formulated above agree with the cuts
model in (diﬀerent) asymptotic regimes. We also use the
cuts model to formulate an extension of the PLR model
that describes the dense resource limit, where all three
models agree.

Like the continuum model, the cuts model is naturally
understood as a continuum limit of a percolation lattice
model, but it is a variant of percolation which includes
an explicit constraint on the resources, as in PLR. The
cuts model removes the assumption that the event sizes
l(x) are nearly continuous (an approximation made in

the continuum model), which makes it possible to span
both the dense and sparse resource regimes in a single
formulation of the model.

Consider a percolation forest ﬁre lattice model in one
dimension. Resources are vacancies that act as dividers
or cuts between connected clusters of occupied sites. An
example of this is shown for d = 1 in Figure 1.
If we
take a continuum limit by rescaling into a ﬁnite interval
and taking the number of lattice sites to inﬁnity, the
the cuts become inﬁnitesimally thin, zero dimensional
dividers between continuous connected regions of unit
density.

The cuts model is deﬁned on position space x, x ∈
[0, Λ] ⊂ ℜ, where Λ is the large-scale cutoﬀ. A discrete
set of zero-dimensional cuts divide the axis into a set of
separate one-dimensional line segments. The model im-
poses the constraint that the maximum number of cuts
is a natural number N . Analogous to the PLR model’s
explicit constraint on total resources (
ri ≤ R), op-
timal solutions make full use of all available resources
(
ri = R in PLR and # cuts=N in cuts). Events
are triggered (sparked) according to a spatial probability
P
function p(x) as in the continuum model, propagating
along the connected cluster, between adjacent cuts. The
position of the ith cut is labeled ci and c0 is at x = 0.
The cut positions deﬁne discrete line segments li and the
corresponding event probabilities pi:

and pi ≡

p(x)dx.

In other words, the cuts map the continuous spatial func-
tion p(x) deﬁned on [0, Λ] ⊂ ℜ into a discrete set of events
with probability pi given by the cumulative probability of
sparking the segment of length li between adjacent cuts.
This mapping is illustrated in Figure 4.

Carlson and Doyle [1] maximized the yield function

with respect to the cut positions. Note that this is the
same yield function used in the PLR model. They found
an iterative solution for the optimal cut positions in the
continuum limit:

pi + li p(ci) = pi+1 − li+1p(ci).

(16)

Unfortunately, analytic solutions to this equation involve
transcendental functions even if there is a simple func-
tional form for p(x).

P

The problem simpliﬁes if we consider a slightly mod-
pili in (15), with
iﬁed cost function, replacing J =
ili, where pt
J t =
pt
i is the probability of events of in-
N
dex greater than i, pt

be naturally motivated in many cases, such as web lay-
out [7]. Furthermore, as we show below, results obtained
for the power laws using this modiﬁed cost function are
equivalent to the original cost function in the small and
large size asymptotic regimes.

With the modiﬁed cost function, we can deﬁne the

yield as

(17)

and optimize the yield with respect to the cut positions
ci by setting ∂Y t/∂ci = 0. Using the deﬁnitions from
Eq. (14), the following iterative equations hold for the
optimal cut positions:

pi = li+1 p(ci).

(18)

This equation is simpler to iterate than Eq. (16).
Its
solutions are no longer transcendental functions, and op-
timal li for general p(x) can easily be found using simple
numerical techniques. Note that the number of cuts N
does not appear explicitly in the recursion relation. In-
stead, the equation requires two initial cut positions, ci
and ci−1(which is the lower limit of integration for the
integral deﬁned as pi). These initial cut positions deﬁne
a length scale, li = ci − ci−1. This length scale together
with the large-scale cutoﬀ, Λ determine the total number
of cuts, N . Therefore, choosing two initial cut positions
is equivalent to specifying N for a ﬁxed Λ.

Cuts model for an exponential distribution of sparks

To solve the recursion equation analytically we ﬁrst
choose p(x) = λe−λx, which leads to an especially simple
solution:

i = e−λci−1.

FIG. 5: Event size l(x) as a function of x for the cuts model.
When the value of l(x) is small (and x is small) the function
is nearly continuous but when the value of l(x) is large the
function is piecewise constant, displaying obvious discontinu-
ities.

We substitute p(x) into Eq. (18) to ﬁnd a recursion rela-
tion for the optimal region sizes:

li+1 =

eλli − 1
λ

.

(21)

Notice that the event sizes increase exponentially as li
becomes large. We use li to construct the function l(x)
which is deﬁned as the event size li when a spark hits site
x. This function is piecewise constant between cuts, as
illustrated in Figure 5. For large x, the function exhibits
large discontinuities. For small x, while still discrete, it
approaches a continuous function.

The slope of P (≥ li) on a log-log plot can be easily
calculated in limiting cases by substituting Eq. (21) into
Eq. (19), dividing ∆ log pt
i by ∆ log li, Taylor expand-
ing, and dropping higher order terms. The limiting case
describing the large event sizes, with sparse resource al-
locations, is discussed in [7]. Following the derivation
there:

(23)

As with the other two models, we are interested in the
probability distribution of event sizes ρ(li) and the cu-
mulative probability distribution P (≥ li). In this case,
solving for P (≥ li) is transparent;

P (≥ li) = pt
i.

(20)

We can also investigate the asymptotic behavior for
small and large events in this model numerically by
choosing two initial cut positions ci and ci−1 and then
iterating Eq. (18) backwards and forwards. The cumula-
tive probability P (≥ li) (large circles) vs. the event size
li is shown in Figure 6(a) and (b), and the limiting power

power law with exponent −2, and the dashed line illustrates
exponent −1. Figure (b) is an enlarged view of (a) in the re-

exponent −2 and the dashed line is −1.

law behaviors in the small and large event size limit de-
rived analytically are apparent. Notice that there are
only a few points in the slope = -1 regime in Figure 6(a).
This is because the event sizes are increasing exponen-
tially as shown in Eq. (21). We can populate the tail
of this distribution by combining many data sets with
slightly diﬀerent initial cut positions, ci, ci−1, and the
results are shown in Figure 7. This models a mixture of
data from systems with the same number of resources N
but diﬀerent large scale cutoﬀs, Λ.

Figure 6(a) and (b) also show the probability density
ρ(li) (small squares) vs. the event size li. For small l, the
cumulative probability has a steeper slope than the prob-
ability density, while for large l the points are very nearly
the same and have the same slope. This occurs because
the probability density for the cuts model is inherently
discrete. As discussed in Section III, if a probability den-
sity is smooth and continuous, the corresponding cumu-

FIG. 7: Cumulative probability P (≥ l) vs. l for a mixture of
data sets with slightly diﬀerent large scale cutoﬀs, Λ. These
data sets are generated as in Figure 6, but sampling the ini-
tial, seed cut positions randomly, and combining data fro the
diﬀerent choices. The second cut position ci was chosen from
a uniform distribution on [200, 300] and the distance between
the ﬁrst and second cut lk was chosen from a uniform distri-
bution on [25, 50]. Note: ci−1 = ci − li.

lative probability can be found by integrating the den-
sity. For example, if p(x) is a power law with exponent
−(α + 1), then the cumulative probability is a power law
with exponent −α, as we intuitively expect. This simple,
intuitive result also applies when data consists of a set of
discrete probabilities pi which are suﬃciently dense that
we can use them to derive a continuous probability distri-
bution as we did in the PLR model Eq. (12). However, in
Figure 6 the discrete probabilities pi are not dense, and
the relationship between P (≥ l) and pi is not the same
as in the continuous case. As li becomes large, Eq. (21)
indicates li+1 >> li, and pi+1 << pi. The cumulative
probability distribution becomes the same as the proba-
bility density in the tail:

P (≥ li) =

This asymptotic behavior is veriﬁed in Figure 6(a) and

Cuts model for a power law distribution of sparks

We can also analytically solve for the optimal cut po-
sitions in the case of a power law distribution of sparks:
p(x) = ax−(a+1) [35]. Using the same procedure as in
the exponential case, we ﬁnd the following results for the
discrete probabilities and the corresponding event sizes:
pi = (ci−1)−a − (ci)−a

FIG. 8: Cumulative probability P (≥ l) (Large circles) and

the cuts model with power law spark probability density with
−(a+1)). Points are calculated
parameter a = 2 (in p(x) = ax
from Eq. (26) iterated forwards 2000 times from the initial
cut positions ci−1 = 1, ci = 1.001. The solid line illustrates a
power law with exponent −4/3, and the dashed line illustrates
exponent −1.

For a > 1, the slope of P (≥ l) vs.
l on a log-log plot
approaches −2a/(a + 1) as l becomes small. As l be-
comes large, the slope approaches −1. These asymp-
totic relationships are derived in Appendix A. In addi-
tion, as a approaches inﬁnity the initial probability den-
sity p(x) = ax−(a+1) decays faster than any power law.
Notice that in the limit a → ∞ we recover −2 as the ex-
ponent for the cumulative probability distribution, which
is exactly the same as the exponential result.

We also investigate the event size distribution for
power law p(x) by solving the recursion relation in
Eq. (26) numerically. Figure 8 shows the cumulative
(large circles) and noncumulative (small squares) event
size distributions for a power law spark distribution with
a = 2 (i.e. p(x) = ax−(a+1) = 2x−3). For small l this
leads to a cumulative probability distributions of event
sizes that has a shallower slope than the corresponding
data for the exponential spark density (Figure 6) but still
a steeper slope than for larger events. The slope of the
cumulative distribution is close to the analytically cal-
culated asymptotic value of α = −2a/(a + 1) = −4/3
in the small event limit (Appendix A). For large l the
slope is approximately −1. The corresponding data for
the case a → 1 (p(x) ∼ 1/x) has slope −1 for the entire
range of event sizes. Additionally, solutions of the cuts
model obtained for a power law distribution of sparks
has the feature that the large event sizes li increase at
a slower rate than in the corresponding exponential so-
lution. Therefore we are able to see more points in the
tail of Figure 8 and easily conﬁrm the slope −1 that we
derive analytically (Appendix A).

V. COMPARING MODELS

We next make more direct comparisons between the
continuum, PLR, and cuts models. Despite the appar-
ent diﬀerences, we show that there are a variety of cases
where one model can be used to approximate another. In
these cases the resulting power laws match. However, in
doing this we face several challenges:

• The PLR and continuum models use the expected
pili (yield
event size as the cost function: J =
function Y in Eq. (15)).

• The continuum and cuts models specify a probabil-
ity density p(x) which is a continuous function of
the spatial position x, while the PLR model spec-
iﬁes condition categories i with discrete probabil-
ities pi which have no a priori association with a
position x.

• The cuts and PLR models specify a set of discrete
probabilities pi and corresponding set of discrete
event sizes li, while the continuum model uses only
continuous p(x) and l(x).

• The cumulative distribution P (≥ l) is an analytic
function of the probability density ρ(l) only if the
density is a continuous function of event size.
If
instead the density ρ(l) (or pi(li)) is discrete, as it is
for the cuts and PLR models, there is no universal
analytic relationship between the cumulative and
noncumulative distributions.

We address all these issues in the subsections that follow.

Comparing results obtained for diﬀerent cost
functions

To reconcile the cost functions of the diﬀerent models
we can either ﬁnd solutions to a “J-cuts model” which
uses the original cost function J, or we can adapt the
PLR model to use the modiﬁed cost function J t. The
recursion relation for the cuts model with the cost func-
tion J, Eq. (16) is more diﬃcult to solve, but fortunately
we can determine the asymptotic behavior of this “J-
cuts model” without solving those equations. This is
because the asymptotic results in the simple exponential
“J t-cuts model” (Eqs. (22) and (23)) are valid for both
cost functions J and J t. In particular, the optimal solu-
tions {li} are asymptotically equal for the two costs (J t,
J) in the limits li → ∞ and li → 0. Proof of this result
is given in Appendix B. This implies that our results for
the cuts model can be directly compared to the results for
the PLR and continuum models in these limiting cases,

as shown in Table I. Alternatively, we can modify the
PLR model to use the same cost function as the “J t-cuts
model”. This is particularly simple if the probability dis-
tribution of sparks p(x) is exponential, since cumulative
and noncumulative exponential distributions are propor-
tional to each other.

Mapping of the PLR event categories to spatial
positions

To compare PLR to other models, we also must decide
how to associate the discrete probabilities pi in the PLR
model with positions x.
In the PLR model, we derive
scaling relations between resources and event sizes by
imagining that each event category i is associated with
a region of the same total length L, inside of which the
probability is a uniform pi as illustrated in Figure 3. (The
length L is later divided up into optimal event sizes li.)
This procedure is discussed in Section III.

To construct a mapping from the event categories to
the real axis, we can use this length L to derive a right-
continuous piecewise constant probability function p(x)
on the real line, as illustrated in Figure 9. We order the pi
so that they are monotonically nonincreasing, associate
each category i with a length L, and place the categories
adjacent to one another on the real line. Then p(x) = pi
whenever x ∈ [(i − 1)L, iL). We can then use PLR
formalism to calculate the optimal event sizes li within
each category. This deﬁnes a event size function l(x)
which describes the size of the loss which occurs when
a spark hits position x. We deﬁne l(x) = li whenever
x ∈ [(i − 1)L, iL). Note that L is the maximum possible
event size in PLR and the large-scale cutoﬀ Λ is deﬁned
by L and the number of event categories n: Λ = nL.

Intuitively, here it is helpful to think of the PLR model
as a coarse-grained version of the cuts model. The piece-
wise constant spark probability density pP LR(x) can be
viewed as an approximation to some underlying continu-
ous probability density pcuts(x) which has been averaged
to produce a constant value over each interval of length

imation to the cuts model with a continuous p(x).

Comparing PLR and cuts

The cuts and PLR models can compared in many
regimes because they both produce inherently discrete
event size distributions. The spatial mapping of event
categories to spatial positions, and the approximation
of a continuous p(x) = pcuts(x) (for cuts) by a piece-
wise continuous pP LR(x) composed from the pi’s lead to
excellent agreement between the two models for a wide
range of p(x). For the cuts model we choose a continuous
probability density:

pcuts(x) = K2e−λx

(27)

For the PLR model we choose a probability density which
is piecewise constant on intervals of length L:

pP LR(x) = K1e−λ(i−(1/2))L, x ǫ [(i−1)L, iL)

(28)

and chose these densities so that pcuts(x) matches
pP LR(x) at the mid-point of each interval. The density

pP LR(x) can be thought of as a coarse-grained average
of pcuts(x). Graphs of these functions are shown in Fig-
ure 10(a). We can trivially modify the PLR model to use
the same cost function J t because cumulative and non-
cumulative exponential distributions are proportional to
each other, implying pt

i ∝ pi.

Next we use the PLR model to ﬁnd the optimal li, and
thus pi(li) and P (≥ li) for the spark probability density
pP LR(x). We take L = 1 and a large scale cutoﬀ Λ which
is n = 10 times larger than L. The cumulative proba-
bility P (≥ li) vs. event size li (large circles) is shown in
Figure 10(b). Note that P (≥ li) has a exponent of −2,
which is exactly the same as the exponent for the non-
cumulative probability pi(li). Again, this is due to the
discrete nature of pi(li) and the exponential p(x) which
is approximated by the piecewise constant pP LR(x).

To obtain the corresponding solution for the event size
distribution of the cuts model, we use the recursion re-
lation (Eq. (18)) to compute the optimal li, ρ(li) and
P (≥ li) for the continuous, exponential p(x) = pcuts(x).
We choose the initial cut positions based on our solution
for the largest event obtained for the corresponding PLR
model above. In other words, we take ci = Λ (the end-
point of the interval on the real axis for the mapping of
the PLR categories into position space) and ci−1 = Λ−ln,
where ln is the largest event size in the PLR model. We
then iterate the recursion relation Eq. (18) backwards
until we reach the cut at position x = 0. The cumulative
probability P (≥ li) vs. event size li (small squares) is
shown in Figure 10(b). P (≥ li) has a exponent of −2
in agreement with PLR for the same cost function J t,
and the corresponding spark distributions pcuts(x) and
pP LR(x).

Thus the cumulative probabilities for the cuts and PLR
models are remarkably similar. This indicates that even
outside the asymptotic regime (li → 0), the cuts model
and the PLR model match for an exponential spark prob-
ability density. Note that in this example we are still in
the regime where the cuts model solution P (≥ li) vs. li
has a slope of −2 on a log-log plot — that is, the dense
resource regime.

Connections between the continuum model and the
discrete PLR and cuts models

We next compare the continuum model, which has a
continuous event size function l(x), with the cuts and
PLR models which both have a piecewise constant l(x),
corresponding to the discrete li for these models (and the
spatial mapping, in the case of PLR). The continuum
model cannot be extended outside of the dense resource
regime, because it builds in the assumption of a continu-
ous event size function l(x). Interestingly, all three mod-
els can be made to agree in the dense resource limit. For
the PLR and cuts models, these correspond to regimes

FIG. 11: Plot of probability density ρ(li) (small squares),
and P (≥ li) (large circles) vs. event size li derived from the
PLR model. The initial probability density p(x) is piecewise
constant function over intervals of length L = 1. p(x) is
deﬁned so that the left-hand end-point of each interval has a
value which ﬁts an exponential density.

in which the piecewise constant function l(x) becomes
nearly continuous. We begin by comparing the contin-
uum model to the cuts model. The cuts model predicts
that for small event sizes (and thus dense resource allo-
cations), the function l(x) will be close to continuous (as
shown in Figure 5). We showed earlier in Eq. (23) that
in the limit li → 0, the J t-cuts model predicts a power
law with exponent −2. In Appendix B, we show that the
solution for the cuts model with the modiﬁed cost func-
tion J t is the same as the solution for the cuts model
with the original cost function J in this limit. There-
fore that the cuts model matches the continuum model
in the limit li → 0, when the two models have the same
cost function J. Note that even though l(x) is approach-
ing a continuous function, p(x) remains discrete, so that
the cumulative distribution of events P (≥ l) is in fact
a steeper power law than the density in this regime, as
illustrated numerically in Figure 6.

Next, to compare the continuum model to PLR, we
note that in PLR, l(x) becomes close to continuous when
the category size L becomes small and the event sizes
li become very small. Formally, this corresponds to the
limit L → 0 with li/L → 0 for every li and every L. As
for the cuts model, this is a case where the discrete PLR
model produces a nearly continuous event size function
l(x), although, the event size probability density pi(li)
remains suﬃciently discrete that computing the cumula-
tive distribution P (≥ li) does not simply correspond to
a unit increase in the exponent, and instead we must be
cautious and do additional work to compute the cumula-
tive exponent, we did for the PLR model in Eq. (23) and
Appendix A.

In d = 1 PLR predicts that the discrete event size prob-
ability density is pi(li) ∝ l−2
, regardless of the density
i
at which points in that density are sampled. Further-
more the PLR model begins with the pi as input (solving
for the li by optimizing resource allocations), so we must

work with the density ﬁrst, then solve for the cumulative
distribution,. Because the pi and li are discrete, there
is no simple relationship between the density pi(li) and
the cumulative distribution P (≥ li). Naively, one might
expect the cumulative probability to be the integral of
the probability density and guess P (≥ li) ∝ l−1
. As
we have stated previously, this is emphatically not the
case. Figure 11 is a numerical simulation of PLR for a
piecewise constant p(x) (using the mapping of event cate-
gories into spatial positions, each of length L given by the
width over which p(x) is constant), which is deﬁned so
that the left-hand end-point of each interval has a value
which ﬁts an exponential density function. This ﬁgure
shows ρ(li) ∝ l−2
as
well. In other words, the cumulative and noncumulative
probabilities on a log-log plot both have a slope of −2.

In fact, it is straightforward to show analytically that
the cumulative slope matches the noncumulative slope
in this case. The PLR probabilities {pi} are given as
exponentially distributed: pi ∝ e−λ(i−1) L, where L is
the category size, which is subdivided into regions of size
li. The large scale cutoﬀ Λ is L × n, where n is the
number of categories. We can calculate the cumulative
probability:

from discrete probability densities can have any one of
a large class of shapes and exponents. For PLR to pre-
dict a cumulative slope P (≥ li) ∝ l−1
(i.e. the same as
the cuts model for large events), the discrete PLR points
ρ(li) must be suﬃciently dense so that the summation of
those points approximates an integral. This occurs when
the li increase very slowly, or equivalently if the spark
probability density p(x) is very heavy tailed. For spark
probability densities p(x) (such as the exponential) which
drop oﬀ quickly, the li increase rapidly (see Eq. (18)) and
PLR will not predict a slope α = −1 for an individual
optimized system.

Interestingly, most data from complex systems like for-
est ﬁres [10] and web traﬃc [3] are suﬃciently dense
that an integral approximation is reasonable. Cumula-
tive slopes of α = −1/d are consistent with the PLR
model when interpreted as in Section III. As previously
mentioned, this might best be explained by viewing these
data sets as mixtures of data from systems which are in-
dividually optimized. In this case a probability density
with a sparsely populated tail (such as Fig. 6(a)) might be
mixed with similar data so that the tail becomes densely
populated. This is precisely what is done in for the cuts
model in Figure 7 and here the mixture power law re-
tains α = −1/d = −1. Thus it is possible that mixtures
of PLR models could be made consistent with the cuts
model in the limit of large event sizes. However, because
PLR makes analytic predictions only for noncumulative
probability densities pi(li), in the absence of a more thor-
ough analysis of mixtures of PLR solution, we can draw
no further general conclusions about the behavior of cu-
mulative probabilities P (≥ li) for large li in this paper.
Instead, we reserve this issue for a more detailed analysis
in [34].

VI. PATHOLOGIES OF THE LATTICE MODEL

where we have used the fact that because L → 0 the
reciprocal of the norm, ∆(L), approaches zero and we
can approximate the sum as an integral. We also drop
the term proportional to e−λΛ, which is much smaller
than e−λ(i−1) L. Thus the cumulative distribution is pro-
portional to the noncumulative distribution in this limit,
and the continuum, cuts, and PLR models all match in
the regime where resources are dense and event sizes are
small.

PLR and cuts for large events

A ﬁnal question is whether the PLR model is similar
to the cuts model in the limit of very large event sizes,
where the cuts model predicts P (≥ li) has a exponent
of −1. As we mentioned earlier, in one dimension the
PLR model predicts pi(li) ∝ l−2
for every li and ev-
ery L. However, cumulative distributions which result

i

Abstract forest ﬁre models have arisen as paradigms
in complex systems theory, initially for the SOC mecha-
nism [25, 27, 28] and later also for HOT [1, 3, 10]. In-
spiration for SOC comes from statistical physics, where
lattice models have played a central role in theoretical
explorations of large scale consequences of local interac-
tions [30]. HOT is motivated by biology and engineering,
where lattice models are a less natural starting point.
Nonetheless, in an eﬀort to clarify comparisons between
the mechanisms, and because of their pedagogical ex-
planatory power, study of HOT also began with lattice
models. However, in the limit of large lattices, the HOT
lattice model can become somewhat pathological, which
led to the alternative HOT models analyzed in this pa-
per. In this section we discuss the nature of this pathol-
ogy. It arises in what corresponds to a natural limit for
percolation in statistical physics that goes awry in the
analogous HOT model, because the diﬀerence in scaling

between the d−dimensional contiguous regions, and the
(d − 1)−dimensional barriers.

SOC builds on the concept of criticality in statisti-
cal physics. The percolation phase transition is associ-
ated with a critical density of occupied sites, at which a
connected cluster of nearest neighbor occupied sites ﬁrst
spans the lattice (say, from top to bottom) in the limit of
inﬁnite lattice size. Inﬁnitesimally above the critical den-
sity, the inﬁnite cluster exists with probability converg-
ing to unity as the lattice size diverges. Simultaneously
the probability any given site is connected to the inﬁnite
cluster converges to zero. This occurs because the inﬁ-
nite cluster is a fractal. An immediate consequence of
the fact that the fractal dimension is less than the lattice
in
dimension is that removal of the inﬁnite cluster (i.e.
the largest possible ﬁre) does not alter the lattice density
even though the cluster is system-spanning (i.e. would
stretch across the entire forest). At the critical density,
and only at the critical density, the distribution of cluster
sizes in the ensemble is described by a power law.

In statistical physics power law predictions are typi-
cally sharpened by taking the limit of inﬁnite lattice size.
However, in attempting this for the HOT lattice model
a problem emerges, that makes the large lattice limit ill-
posed. This also reveals more clearly an intrinsic ﬂaw in
the lattice model when it comes to modeling mechanisms
and costs associated with suppression of ﬁres and other
cascading events in highly designed or evolved systems
[6]. Consider the lattice model in d = 2.
In both the
HOT and SOC lattice model a ﬁrebreak forms when any
unbroken chain of empty lattice sites isolates a connected
cluster, even if the chain is only one lattice spacing wide.
In SOC (and criticality) the underlying randomness with
which conﬁgurations are generated, and the symmetry
between vacant and occupied sites, results in a critical
density of 0.4 (0.59) in d = 2 which is bounded away from
unity, so that a ﬁnite fraction of the lattice is devoted to
both clusters and ﬁrebreaks in the limit of inﬁnite size.
In other words, the size of the ﬁrebreaks scales in the
same way as the size of the connected clusters. However,
in the HOT version, simple optimization of yield (num-
ber of trees remaining after a single spark, averaged over
the spark distribution) leads to macroscopic, compact
clusters of trees separated by narrow (one lattice spac-
ing wide), eﬃcient (linear) ﬁrebreaks. Thus in the limit
of large lattices the cost in density and yield associated
with each ﬁrebreak becomes vanishingly small.

To visualize how the cost of ﬁrebreaks becomes negli-
gible for large lattices and why this is a problem, con-
sider large N × N lattices as N → ∞. A vertical line of
empty sites extending from top to bottom on the lattice
involves N sites, and so the cost in lattice density asso-
ciated with making those sites vacant is N/N 2 = 1/N .
This cut divides an otherwise fully occupied lattice into
two separate regions (left and right of the ﬁrebreak). In
the limit N → ∞, the cost in density of the cut is zero,

14

even though the division of the lattice into two separate
regions is preserved. Similarly, a collection of equally
spaced vertical and horizontal cuts on an otherwise oc-
cupied lattice results in a gridded conﬁguration dividing
the lattice into square regions of equal size, each out-
lined by a ﬁrebreak one lattice spacing wide on each of
the four sides. For this conﬁguration, all ﬁres are of equal
size (the area of the contiguous square). For a ﬁnite lat-
tice such a solution could only be optimal for a spatially
uniform distribution of sparks. However, in the limit
N → ∞ an inﬁnite family of such solutions all achieve
the maximum yield of unity. All that is required is that
the cuts be positioned far enough apart that the grid
of ﬁrebreaks consume zero density, yet close enough to-
gether that the density cost associated with a ﬁre in any
individual square of contiguous occupied sites is also zero.
This is achieved whenever the spacing between grid lines
scales like N γ with 0 < γ < 1. This produces a yield
of unburnt trees that is asymptotically perfect (i.e. ap-
proaches unity) for the entire forest for any distribution
of sparks, with inﬁnitesimal ﬁre sizes.

It is straightforward to generalize this argument to
higher dimensions, because it relies only on the fact that
the barriers scale diﬀerently (like d − 1) compared to
the the compact regions (like d). Unrealistically, a lit-
eral interpretation of the lattice model suggests that with
proper management and minimal cost, essentially all ﬁres
could be eliminated[6]. While this form of the HOT lat-
tice model is useful pedagogically as it exhibits such strik-
ing diﬀerences from the SOC version, it has too many
ﬂaws to be taken literally as a model of real forest ﬁres
because the costs of resources for suppression are not ac-
counted for properly. While there is a natural duality
between vacant and occupied sites in the models of sta-
tistical physics, in HOT models vacancies are resources
which deﬁne boundaries that scale diﬀerently than the
bulk substrate. For speciﬁc applications, resources are
rarely (if ever) simply the absence of substrate. Even
ﬁrebreaks constructed on forest land (e.g. roads) are not
simply the absence of trees, but are cut and maintained
at signiﬁcant economic expense.

VII. DISCUSSION

The abstract HOT models studied in this paper cor-
rect the pathology of the original HOT lattice model by
explicitly accounting for resource use. The PLR and
cuts models do this through an explicit cap on the to-
tal resources available. The continuum model does this
through inclusion of an explicit resource cost term in the
yield function. Several preliminary calculations suggest
that at least within a range of functional representations,
the speciﬁc manner in which resources are accounted for
is not a crucial factor in determining the exponent in the
power law for these models. For example, a more gen-

eral cost-beneﬁt term describing resource use can replace
the explicit cap on resources in the PLR model, at the
expense of analytical tractability of the model, but with
no signiﬁcant change in the exponent. Analogously, the
cuts model (in the limit of small event sizes) and the
continuum model can lead to the same power law expo-
nent, in spite of the fact that they account for the cost
of resources in diﬀerent ways.

The key feature in determining the size distribution for
a given model is that we optimize, while measuring the
cost (or loss) in terms of the average event size. Alterna-
tive formulations of the continuum model [1, 6] have con-
sidered alternative cost or utility functions, which clearly
can lead to modiﬁcations in the event size distribution.
For example, if the cost function puts a large penalty for
events greater than a given size, then more resources will
be devoted to large events, at the expense of more smaller
events, and a great average size. Such considerations are
clearly relevant in cases such as ﬁnance and economics,
where risk-seeking and risk-averse strategies come into
play.

Compared with models based on criticality, the power
laws predicted by all of the HOT models are much
steeper, and have the opposite trends with dimension-
ality.
In criticality the exponents become smaller for
lower dimensional problems. This is the opposite of
the trends observed in data [3], which typically exhibit
steeper power laws for lower dimensional problems, as in
HOT. It is worth noting (especially given our focus on
d = 1) that while percolation in d = 1 has the (triv-
ial) critical density of unity– the only way connectivity
can arise across a one dimensional lattice is for every site
to be occupied– the conﬁgurations and size distribution
(not a power law in d = 1) which arise in random per-
colation in the neighborhood of the critical density even
in that case are completely unlike those that arise in the
corresponding one-dimensional HOT lattices.
In criti-
cality, the placement of vacancies is random, whereas in
HOT the speciﬁc placement of vacancies is dictated by
optimization.

In models based on criticality, the self-similar, frac-
tal event shapes, reﬂect a mechanism which is intrinsi-
cally scale-free, producing a single exponent, spanning all
scales. In contrast, in HOT models heavy-tailed distri-
butions arise from optimization on a macroscopic scale.
Compact regions predicted by HOT are not fractal or
self-similar and there is no reason to expect that small
scale events will a priori be described by the same power
law as large scale events.

The cuts model is a clear example in which we do ob-
serve a heavy-tailed event size distribution, with asymp-
totically diﬀerent power law exponents as we vary the
scale. This model highlights the essential diﬀerence be-
tween the dense and sparse resource regimes, which in
the original formulations of the continuum and PLR
models emerge from the distinction between inherently

15

In the continuum case,

continuum and discrete ﬁelds describing probabilities,
resources, and losses.
it is
simply not possible to capture features which could
arise as a consequence of discrete, sharp, well-separated
boundaries– the sparse resource regime. Thus the con-
tinuum model agrees with the cuts model only in the
limit that the cuts (which are sharp and discrete) are
placed asymptotically close together, i.e. the dense re-
source limit. On the other hand, the PLR model, which
assumes discrete event categories, can in principle cap-
ture both the dense resource limit and the sparse resource
regime, though the latter will need additional treatment
because of the intrinsic role that mixtures play in real
data. In this paper we explored the PLR model in the
limit of dense resources, by taking the length scales of
the system L and the event sizes li/L simultaneously to
zero. In this limit, the PLR model can capture the the
continuous, spatial spark distribution p(x), though PLR
(and cuts) remain intrinsically discrete.

Based on this analysis, it may appear that the cuts
model is the clear winner, simultaneously capturing the
full range of behaviors seen in the other two, and this
would be true if we only considered d = 1. However, in
order to generalize the cuts model beyond d = 1 it is
necessary to constrain the optimization procedure. For
example, in [1] this was done by specifying a grid de-
sign. In many cases, such a constrained design may not
be desirable, and the abstractions of the other models
may be preferred. The continuum and PLR models are
both easily formulated in arbitrary dimension d, but with
diﬀerent predictions for the exponents. As we’ve shown
here, the PLR model can be extended to the dense re-
source regime, where it agrees with the predictions of the
continuum model. The reverse is not the case. In that
sense, the continuum model is less ﬂexible. Furthermore,
the PLR model has been far more successful in capturing
statistics of event size distributions, assuming data sets
are dense enough to be described as continuous distribu-
tions (e.g. assuming they are mixtures [34]). Examples
which have been studied include world wide web traﬃc,
forest ﬁres, and power outages [3, 4, 9].

In comparison, we do not yet have any clear exam-
ples where the predictions of the continuum model have
been shown to apply. Perhaps the reason behind this lies
in the fact that data is almost exclusively collected for
large events in the sparse resource regime.
In regimes
where resources are abundant, one may simply choose
not to optimize. Small ﬁle downloads, ﬁres, and outages
are rarely monitored, and small scale cutoﬀs, whether
deliberately imposed for convenience or arising from an
inherent physical mechanism, tend to prevent detailed
statistical analysis of this regime. In any case, statistical
distributions remain only a starting point for understand-
ing mechanisms for complexity and modeling system fail-
ure. Success arises from the study of simple models when
their predictions capture aspects of the system which can

be described and quantiﬁed at a relatively low resolution.
From this initial success, they can inspire a sequence of
higher resolution models and observations to understand
and anticipate detailed mechanisms for cascading failure
in natural and technological systems.

In this appendix we derive the slope of P (≥ li) on a
log-log plot for a cuts model where the initial probability
density is described by a power law, p(x) = ax−(a+1).
First we use the cuts model to ﬁnd an analytic description
for the set of discrete probabilities pi and event sizes li:

pi = (ci−1)−a − (ci)−a

Now we evaluate the denominator:

(33)

This is the slope of P (≥ li) on a log-log plot in the limit
where l becomes small.

Now we will look in the opposite limit, where l becomes
large. We ﬁrst show that l → ∞ implies ci−1
li → 0 if
a > 1. Using the deﬁnition for li+1 in Eq. (30) we derive
a recursion relation for ci/li+1 ≡ gi.

(cid:17)

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

We note that gi will always be less than 1. Therefore we
can use the binomial expansion and write out the terms
to lowest order in gi−1:

gi =

a
(gi−1)−a −

(cid:0)

1 − agi−1 + O(g2

i−1)

1 − agi−1 + O(g2
i−1)
(cid:1)

(40)

(cid:0)

Now we note that if we assume gi−1 << 1 for large i
we can drop all terms of order g2
i−1. Also, for a > 1 the
ﬁrst term in the denominator will be much larger than
the other terms, and we drop all the other terms in the
denominator. Then we have:

(cid:1)

a (1 − agi−1)

gi ≃

(gi−1)−a ≃ a(gi−1)a + a2(gi−1)a+1
We can then ﬁnd the ratio of consecutive terms:

(41)

gi/gi−1 ≃ a (gi−1)a−1 + a2(gi−1)a

(42)

Because gi < 1 for all gi, we see that our assumption
that gi << 1 was indeed valid, and that the sequence
goes to zero as i approaches inﬁnity. We also note that if
a < 1, we can no longer assume that the ﬁrst term in the
denominator in Eq. (40) is much larger than 1. In fact,
as a → 0 the ﬁrst term in the denominator approaches 1,
and it is not true that ci−1
li approaches zero for large li.
We now solve Eq. (32) for terms which we can Tay-
. First we simplify the

−a log(ci−1 + li) + a log(ci−1)

l.

APPENDIX B: OPTIMAL SOLUTIONS FOR
TWO DIFFERENT COST FUNCTIONS

We are interested in comparing the optimal solutions
for two diﬀerent cost functions (equivalently, for two dif-
ferent yield functions Y in Eq. (15) and Y t in Eq. (17)).
The ﬁrst cost function J =
pili equates cost with ex-
pected event size, and is used in PLR and continuum
P
pt
models. The second cost function J t =
ili equates
cost with expected transferred event size and is used in
the cuts model. This situation arises when the frequency
with which an event is “transferred” is equal to the cu-
mulative probability of all larger events. One example is
sequentially linked web ﬁles. Though J t is less intuitive
than J, it has the very nice property that one can an-
alytically solve for the optimal event sizes li given cost
function J t. In most situations, however, we are really
interested in optimizing the original cost function J.

P

In this section we will show that the optimal solutions
{li} are the same for either deﬁnition of cost (J t, J) in
the limits li → ∞ and li → 0. This allows us to directly
compare analytic results from the cuts model with results
from continuum and PLR models in limiting cases.

First, we recall that optimizing J leads to a recursion

relation for optimal event sizes li,

pi + [lip(ci) − pi+1] = li+1 p(ci)

(50)

while optimizing J t leads to a diﬀerent recursion rela-

tion.

pi = li+1 p(ci)

(51)

Comparing Eq. (51) and (50), we see they give the
same result if the bracketed term in Eq. (50), ǫ ≡ lip(ci)−
pi+1, is much smaller than pi. First we will show this is
the the case in the limit li → 0.

We want to show:

ǫ = lip(ci) − pi+1 << pi

lip(ci) << pi + pi+1

(52)

We can rewrite the right-hand side as

pi + pi+1 =

p(x)dx = pavg(li+1 + li)

(53)

ci+1

ci−1

Z

where pavg is the average value of p(x) on the interval

[ci−1,ci+1].

18

Then Eq. (52) can be rewritten as

(p(ci) − pavg)li << pavg li+1

(54)

We use the recursion relation for the event sizes given

by Eq. (21):

li+1 =

eλli − 1
λ

(55)

In the limit li → 0 this implies li+1 = li + O(l2

i ). Ne-

glecting terms of order l2

i we have

(p(ci) − pavg) << pavg

(56)

The position ci approaches the midpoint of the inter-
val [ci−1,ci+1] because li+1 → li. As the length of the
interval goes to 0, the value of p(x) at the midpoint,
p(ci), approaches the average value of p(x) over the inter-
val. Therefore the left hand side of Eq. (56) is negligible
compared to the right-hand side. In the limit li → 0, ǫ is
much smaller than pi.

Now we will show that this is the case for the limit as
li → ∞. Starting from Eq. (52) we again want to show:

li p(ci) << pi+1 + pi =

p(x)dx

(57)

ci+1

ci−1

Z

Substituting λe−λx for p(x) we have

liλe−λci << −e−λci+1 + e−λci−1

<< e−λci−1 (e−λ(li+li+1) + 1)
<< e−λci−1

(58)

where we have used e−λli << 1. Then we have

log(λli) − λci << −λci−1
log(λli) << λli

(59)

For li → ∞ and λ ﬁxed, log(λli) is negligible compared
to λli. Therefore in the limit li → ∞, ǫ is much smaller
than pi.

Therefore in these two limits, optimizing J t results in

the same optimal event sizes as optimizing J.

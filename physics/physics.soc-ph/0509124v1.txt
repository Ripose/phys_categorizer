Synchronized ﬂow and wide moving jams from balanced vehicular traﬃc

(Dated: February 21, 2014)

Recently we proposed an extension to the traﬃc model of Aw, Rascle and Greenberg. The
extended traﬃc model can be written as a hyperbolic system of balance laws and numerically
reproduces the reverse λ shape of the fundamental diagram of traﬃc ﬂow. In the current work we
analyze the steady state solutions of the new model and their stability properties. In addition to
the equilibrium ﬂow curve the trivial steady state solutions form two additional branches in the
ﬂow-density diagram. We show that the characteristic structure excludes parts of these branches
resulting in the reverse λ shape of the ﬂow-density relation. The upper branch is metastable against
the formation of synchronized ﬂow for intermediate densities and unstable for high densities, whereas
the lower branch is unstable for intermediate densities and metastable for high densities. Moreover,
the model can reproduce the typical speed of the downstream front of wide moving jams. It further
reproduces a constant outﬂow from wide moving jams, which is far below the maximum free ﬂow.
Applying the model to simulate traﬃc ﬂow at a bottleneck we observe a general pattern with wide
moving jams traveling through the bottleneck.

INTRODUCTION

Modeling vehicular traﬃc ﬂow using methods from
continuum ﬂuid dynamics has a long history [1, 2, 3, 4],
with many contributions mainly from traﬃc engineers,
physicists and mathematicians. The existing models can
be subdivided into ﬁrst and higher order models accord-
ing to the highest derivative appearing in the partial
diﬀerential equations describing traﬃc ﬂow. First or-
der models, as the classical model of Lighthill, Whitham
and Richards [5, 6], approximate the higher order models
by neglecting diﬀusion terms in the same way the Euler
equation approximates the Navier-Stokes equation. As a
consequence, discontinuous data can develop, which have
to be dealt with by a numerical algorithm.

In the existing literature on ﬁrst order systems of ve-
hicular traﬃc ﬂow the role of the source term has not
been studied in depth, the main focus has been laid
on the principal part of the equations [7] and systems
with constant relaxation time [8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. In [13],
we presented the balanced vehicular traﬃc model (BVT
model), which generalizes the model of Aw, Rascle and
Greenberg [7, 8] by prescribing a more general source
term subsumed under an eﬀective relaxation coeﬃcient.
Unlike in earlier studies, this eﬀective relaxation coeﬃ-
cient depends on both traﬃc density and velocity. As we
showed in numerical simulations in [13], the model can
reproduce the observed reverse λ shape of the fundamen-
tal diagram of traﬃc ﬂow [14].

In the current work we aim at obtaining a better under-
standing of the numerical results of the BVT model. In
particular we study the appearance of the new branches
in the fundamental diagram in the congested regime,
which ﬁnally form the reverse λ shape. Our explana-
tion of the reverse λ shape diﬀers from earlier expla-
nations, which explained the reverse λ as a part of the

equilibrium ﬂow branch.
In contrast, as we will show,
the new branches in the BVT model correspond to non-
equilibrium steady state solutions. Hence, the criti-
cism of the one-dimensionality of steady states of ﬂuid-
dynamical models [4] does not apply to the BVT model.
In the BVT model traﬃc ﬂow is described by the fol-
lowing system of balance laws determining the density
ρ = ρ(t, x) and velocity v = v(t, x) of vehicles

become negative for intermediate to high densities (5).

Lee, Lee and Kim [16], our analysis - being performed on
a ﬁrst order system - is considerably simpler. Note, how-
ever, that due to the possibility of dealing with discon-
tinuous solutions, we can in principle have more general
solutions in the balanced system (1)-(2) (see also [1] and
references therein).

Let us repeat, that for a steady state solution, there is

α1 = −0.2, α2 = −0.8, α3 = 7 and c = −14 km/h. The
density values, which determine the sign of β according to
Eqs. (5)-(6), are ρ1 = 38.18 [1/km] and ρ2 = ρm. These
parameter functions and values describe traﬃc ﬂow on
a two-lane highway more realistically. Moreover, as our
simulations show, the analytically derived properties of
the model of Aw, Rascle and Greenberg, that the velocity
does not become negative and collisions do not occur,
carry over to our system.

In order to obtain a deeper insight into the structure
of the BVT model we study the smooth steady state so-
lutions in Sec. II. Our numerical simulations produce
more general solutions approximating steady states so-
lutions, which will be discussed in Sec. III. In Sec. IV,
we assess the stability properties of the steady state so-
lutions. With theses results we classify the traﬃc states
of the BVT model according to the three traﬃc phases
of Kerner [4] in Sec. V and apply the BVT model to sim-
ulate traﬃc ﬂow at a bottleneck in Sec. VI. We conclude
the paper in Sec. VII.

It follows from the continuity equation (13) that for all
steady state solutions there is a constant q such that

ρv = q + ρw.

(19)

Hence steady state solutions are restricted to straight
lines in the fundamental diagram of traﬃc ﬂow. More-
over, the minimum and maximum speed of information
propagation in system (1)-(2) limit the physically admis-
sible steady state solutions, i.e. the velocity w, as

λ1 = v + ρu′(ρ) ≤ w ≤ λ2 = v.

(20)

Let us assume that v − w > 0 (else q = 0). Then we can
solve Eqn. (19) for the density

ρ =

q
v − w

(21)

and substitute it into Eqn. (14), yielding the ordinary
diﬀerential equation for steady state solutions in the BVT
model

FIG. 1: The trivial steady state solutions (i.e. solutions with
dv
dz = 0) of the BVT model. These solutions are the equi-
librium solution v = u(ρ) (solid black curve) and the two
branches fulﬁlling β(ρ, v) = 0 (dashed curves). On top, we
present the results of simulation runs of perturbed equilib-
rium data. The simulated data points in the fundamental
diagram are closely related to sections of trivial steady state
solutions fulﬁlling β(ρ, v) = 0.

We summarize the trivial steady state solutions in Fig. 1.
We further show in this ﬁgure the results of simulation
runs for constant initial data in equilibrium ρ = ρ0,
ρ0 = 2, 4, ..., 318, v = u(ρ0) on a 7 km long stretch
of a highway with periodic boundary conditions, pre-
scribing a small amplitude perturbation of the density
δρ = sin(πx) initially located between 2 and 3 km on top.
The data points were extracted from the simulations at
5 equidistantly distributed virtual detectors after an evo-
lution time of 10 h. As one can see from the plot many
data points of the numerical solutions are closely related
to branch sections of trivial steady state solutions. This
is in particular the case for the jam line which is almost
fully covered by data points.

FIG. 2: Characteristic structure and steady state solutions of
the BVT model. As solid lines we plot the trivial steady state
solutions bordering the regions I - IV. On top (dashed curves)
we plot the characteristic curves with slope λ1 and λ2 respec-
tively. As the speed of steady-state solutions is limited by the
characteristic speeds λ1 and λ2, physically admissible steady
state solutions lie inside the characteristic cones spanned by
these two speeds at every point (ρ,ρv) in the ﬂow-density di-
agram.

In the following we restrict the discussion to the phys-
ically admissible smooth solutions (in particular we do
not consider solutions with inﬁnite gradient). In the limit
z → ±∞ all maximally extended steady state solutions
approach one of the following curve sections:

A: free equilibrium ﬂow: v = u(ρ) and ρ ≤ ρ1,
B: unstable equilibrium ﬂow: v = u(ρ) and ρ1 < ρ ≤ ρ2,
C: jam line: see Eqn. (24),

D: tip of the reverse λ: see Eqn. (25),

We classify the non-trivial maximally extended steady so-
lutions according to the behavior in the limit z → ±∞,
using the letters of the corresponding branches. Due
to the characteristic structure of the BVT model (see

and limz→±∞

the classes AD, BC, BD, CC and DD [20]. Schematically,

Comparing our classiﬁcation to the classiﬁcation of Lee,
Lee, Kim [16] for cases, where the parameters q and w
lead to a camelback-shaped proﬁle of the potential U , the
solutions correspond to minimum-saddle solutions (with-
out oscillations). The possible appearance of the diﬀerent
solution classes in the ﬂow-density diagram is shown in
Fig. 4.

III. QUASI STEADY STATE SOLUTIONS

In principal, some of the non-trivial steady state so-
lutions described before can be glued together to form
discontinuous, periodic steady state solutions [11, 12].
Steady state solutions can be linked by a shock wave, if
the quantities ρ−, v− left to the interface and the corre-
sponding quantities ρ+, v+ right of the interface satisfy
the following conditions [7, 8]:

z

ρ+ > ρ−,

(27)

ρ+(v+ − u(ρ+)) = ρ−(v− − u(ρ−)).

(28)

With the equation of steady state solutions

ρ±v± = q + ρ±w,

(29)

we obtain from Eqn. (28)

w(ρ+ − ρ−) = ρ+u(ρ+) − ρ−u(ρ−).

(30)

The monotonicity of the velocity of steady state solu-
tions, which follows from Eqn. (22) (see also Fig. 3), re-
lates to the monotonicity of the density according to

dρ
dz

= −

ρ
v − w

dv
dz

.

(31)

Therefore, condition (27) restricts periodic steady state
solutions linked by shock waves to regions II and IV of
Fig. 2.

In the following we focus on steady state solutions of
type DD in region II. In particular, steady state solutions
lying inside region II have to intersect the jam line at
velocity values for which the condition

(ρvj(ρ))′′ > 0

(32)

is fulﬁlled. For the chosen parameter values, this implies
ρ− > 73.02 [1/km]. A necessary requirement to fulﬁll
Eqn. (30) is the condition

(ρu(ρ))′|ρ=ρ− ≥ (ρvj(ρ))′

ρ=ρ− ,

(33)

which results in our particular case to ρ− ≤ 123.14
[1/km]. Therefore, for the chosen parameter values there
is only a very small parameter range where periodic
steady state solutions linked by shock waves are possi-
ble. However, in our numerical simulation, we ﬁnd quasi
steady state solutions in a much larger region of parame-
ter space (see Fig. 1). To obtain a more detailed picture
of these quasi stationary solutions, we plot the simulation
results of unstable equilibrium data in Fig. 5, focusing on
the evolution between 8 and 10 hours simulation time.
We started the simulation of Fig. 5 with constant initial
data ρ = ρ0 = 200 [1/km], v = u(ρ0) and a sinusoidal
density perturbation on top. After a long evolution time

FIG. 5: Quasi steady state solution at the jam line for a
numerical simulation of perturbed equilibrium data with ini-
tial density ρ = 200 [1/km]. Between a simulation time of 8
and 10 h the evolution is quasi-stationary with a propagation
speed of about w ≈ −14 km/h.

we obtain a quasi steady state close to the jam line, prop-
agating with a velocity v ≈ −14 km/h upstream. This
quasi steady state solution is not a true steady state so-
lution, the amplitude slowly decreases with time, as it
can be scarcely noted in the ﬁgure. The solution con-
sists of diﬀerent branches close to the trivial steady state
solutions lying in regions I/II of Fig. 2. Thus, for quasi
steady state solutions the quantities q and w of steady
state solutions (see Eqn. (19)) are only approximately
constant.

Similar quasi-steady state solutions also exist for a sec-
tion of the tip of the reverse λ branch (see Sec. IV below).
They consist of approximate steady state solutions lying
in regions III/IV of Fig. 2. However, these quasi steady
state solutions travel downstream with a velocity approx-
imately given by the tangent of the tip of the reverse λ
ﬂow curve.

IV. STABILITY ANALYSIS OF THE STEADY
STATE SOLUTIONS

Due to the importance of steady state solutions at the
jam line and the tip of the reverse λ (see Fig. 1) we focus
the stability analysis on the trivial steady state solutions
of the BVT model.

A. Linear stability analysis

As presented in [13] the equilibrium ﬂow curve ρv =
ρu(ρ) is linearly stable for ρ < ρ1 and linearly unstable
in the intermediate to high density regime ρ1 < ρ <
ρ2. Here we extend the linear stability analysis to all

0

5

steady state solutions obtained from setting β(ρ, v) =
0, i.e.
steady state solutions Eqs. (24) and (25). We
denote the corresponding constant states (ρ0, vj/t(ρ0)).
Plugging the ansatz

ρ = ρ0 + ˜ρ exp(ilx + ω(l)t),
v = vj/t(ρ0) + ˜v exp(ilx + ω(l)t)

(34)

(35)

into the evolution equations (13) and (14) we obtain
as characteristic equations for the existence of solutions
(˜ρ, ˜v) 6= (0, 0):

(ω + ilvj/t)2 + (ω + ilvj/t)(ilu

′

ρ0 + (vj/t − u)

−ρ0il

(vj/t − u) = 0.

∂β
∂ρ

∂β
∂v

)

(36)

Solving the last equation for ω we can distinguish be-
tween the linearly stable and unstable regime of the
trivial steady-state solutions, i.e.
curve sections with
Re(ω) ≤ 0 for arbitrary l and curve sections for which
Re(ω) > 0 for some l respectively. We ﬁnd that the
jam line is linearly unstable for ρ1 < ρ ≤ ˜ρj = 79.46
[1/km] and linearly stable for ˜ρj < ρ < ρ2, whereas
the tip of the reverse λ is linearly stable for densities
ρ1 < ρ ≤ ˜ρt = 79.46 [1/km] and linearly unstable for
˜ρj < ρ < ρ2.

In the following we will give a more intuitive explana-
tion for the above results. For trivial steady state solu-
tions with exactly constant density and velocity proﬁle,
the characteristic structure (20) does not give any restric-
tions. However, quasi steady state solutions with non-
constant density (velocity) on these trivial steady state
branches travel with a velocity w which corresponds to
the derivative of the ﬂow density curve

w ≈

d(ρvj/t)
dρ

.

(37)

Hence, in order to fulﬁll condition (20) the local char-
acteristic cone has to enclose the corresponding steady
state branch spanned by the characteristic speeds λ1 and
λ2, i.e. λ1 ≤ w ≤ λ2. For our parameter values the
characteristic condition restricts possible stable (quasi)
steady state solutions at the jam line to solutions ful-
ﬁlling ρ > ˜ρj = 79.46 [1/km] and those at the tip of the
reverse λ to solutions fulﬁlling ρ ≤ ˜ρt = 79.46 [1/km] (see
Fig. 2). Note, that the two densities need not agree for
a general parameterization. For our parameterization, it
follows from the appearance of the term ∆v(ρ) in both,
Eqs. (24) and (25).

Next we study the nonlinear stability properties in sim-

ulations of the full system.

B. Numerical results

We ﬁrst analyze the stability properties of the tip of
the reverse λ branch of steady state solutions, Eqn. (25).

2 < x < 3 km. In the ﬁgure, we plot the maximum value of
vt(ρ0) + vampl, vampl ≤ 0, for which the initial data is unsta-
ble against the formation of synchronized ﬂow, for diﬀerent
evolution times. For densities ρ < 79 [1/km], the tip of the
reverse λ is metastable, it becomes unstable against the for-
mation of synchronized ﬂow for suﬃciently small values vampl.
For densities ρ > 79 [1/km] the tip of the reverse λ is unstable
against the formation of synchronized traﬃc ﬂow.
Right panel: Analysis of the stability properties of the jam

minimum value of vj (ρ0) + vampl, vampl ≥ 0, for which the
initial data is unstable against the formation of synchronized
ﬂow, for diﬀerent evolution times. For densities ρ > 79 [1/km]
the jam line is metastable, it becomes unstable only for suﬃ-
ciently large values vampl. For densities ρ < 79 [1/km] the jam
line is unstable against the formation of synchronized traﬃc
ﬂow.

To this aim, we use constant steady state initial data
ρ = ρ0, v = vt(ρ0) with a sinusoidal perturbation
δv = vampl sin(πx) for 2 < x < 3 km, prescribing cyclic
boundary conditions on a 7 km long highway. In order
to decide whether synchronized ﬂow appears during the
numerical evolution, we use the criteria v(ρ) < u(ρ) or
v(ρ) < vt(ρ) − |vampl|.

As our analysis shows, the stability properties of the tip
of the reverse λ branch depend on the particular pertur-
bation. For the density regime ρ1 < ρ ≤ ˜ρt, the tip of the
reverse λ branch is metastable against the formation of
synchronized ﬂow, i.e. for small amplitude perturbations,
no synchronized ﬂow appears, whereas for larger velocity
perturbations with negative amplitude vampl, synchro-
nized ﬂow appears. For the density regime ˜ρt < ρ < ρ2,
the tip of the reverse λ is unstable against the formation
of synchronized ﬂow. We summarize the corresponding
results in the left panel of Fig. 6.

Second, we study the stability properties of the jam
line, using constant steady state initial data ρ = ρ0,
v = vj(ρ0) again with a sinusoidal perturbation δv =
vampl sin(πx) for 2 < x < 3 km. In this case, we use the
criteria v(ρ) > u(ρ) or v(ρ) > vj(ρ) + |vampl| to identify
synchronized ﬂow.

For densities ˜ρj < ρ < ρ2 the jam line is metastable
against the formation of synchronized ﬂow, i.e. for small
amplitude perturbations, the jam line is stable, for larger
amplitude perturbations (with positive amplitude vampl),
synchronized ﬂow appears.
In contrast, for densities
ρ1 < ρ ≤ ˜ρj [1/km] the jam line is unstable against the
formation of synchronized ﬂow. We show the results in
the right panel of Fig. 6.

We summarize the results of the stability analysis in
Fig. 7. Fig. 7 can also explain the observed gap between
free and congested ﬂow in the fundamental diagram of
traﬃc ﬂow separating the (meta-) stable branch sections.

IDENTIFICATION OF KERNER’S THREE

PHASES OF TRAFFIC FLOW

Kerner [4, 17, 18, 19] classiﬁes traﬃc ﬂow into three
phases:
free ﬂow, synchronized ﬂow and wide moving
jams. In this section we try to relate the traﬃc states of
the BVT model to Kerner’s three phases. We will ﬁrst
summarize our classiﬁcation, before we will discuss the
motivation.

• free ﬂow: Steady state solutions on the equilibrium
velocity curve u = u(ρ) for the density regime 0 ≤
ρ ≤ ρ1 (free equilibrium ﬂow) and (quasi) steady
state solutions close to the tip of the reverse λ in

• wide moving jams: Smooth spatially extended

the metastable regime ˜ρj < ρ < ρ2 [1/km] make up
wide moving jams.

• synchronized ﬂow: All other congested traﬃc states
including the non-trivial steady state solutions of
type BC and BD form synchronized traﬃc ﬂow.

For small densities (0 ≤ ρ ≤ ρ1) free ﬂow is stable in
the BVT model. Moreover, the model can reproduce the
metastability of free ﬂow against the formation of syn-
chronized ﬂow (see Fig. 6), which is observed for traﬃc
states at the tip of the reverse λ branch ρ1 < ρ ≤ ˜ρt. It
can also explain that instabilities only appear for velocity
perturbations with negative amplitude.

B. Wide moving jams

As our results show wide moving jams as deﬁned above
are stable against small amplitude perturbations. For the
chosen parameter values the propagation speed of wide
moving jams lies between −16 < w < −14 [km/h] for
it is nearly
the density region ˜ρt < ρ ≤ ρ2 [1/km], i.e.
constant and reproduces the observed value.

We further analyzed the outﬂow from wide moving
jams (see Fig. 8). We ﬁnd for wide moving jams in the
density region ˜ρt < ρ < 250 [1/km] a constant outﬂow of
about fout = 3830 [1/h]. This can be seen in the lower
right panel of Fig. 8, where we plot the outﬂow from
wide moving jams ρ = ρj, v = vj (ρj) initially located
between 2 and 3 km and surrounded by a region of free
ﬂow ρ = ρf , v = u(ρf ).

C. Synchronized ﬂow

Synchronized ﬂow as deﬁned above covers a wide re-
gion in the fundamental diagram. This can be already
seen in the left panel of Fig. 4 for steady state solutions of
type BC and BD. We exemplarily show the formation of
synchronized ﬂow from free ﬂow of density ρ = 60 [1/km].
As a nucleus for the emergence of synchronized ﬂow, we
use a velocity perturbation δv = −7 sin(πx) located be-
tween 2 an 3 km on a highway with periodic boundary
conditions. The evolution of these initial data leads to
states which cover a wide region in the fundamental dia-
gram, as it can be seen in Fig. 9.

FIG. 8: Upper two panels: Simulation of the outﬂow from
a wide moving jam. Plotted are the evolution of the density
and the velocity as a function of space and time. In the initial
data we prescribe a wide moving jam with density ρj = 200
[1/km] between 2 and 3 km, and free ﬂow with density ρf = 10
[1/km] elsewhere. During the evolution, the wide moving jam
narrows down and ﬁnally dissolves.
Lower left panel: Flow-density diagram for the above simu-
lation results after t = 0.02 h. In addition we plot the curve
representing the equilibrium ﬂow as well as the jam line and
the tip of the reverse λ. We determine the outﬂow of the wide
moving jam at that point for which the velocity of the outﬂow
diﬀers from the equilibrium velocity by less than 1 %.
Lower right panel: Outﬂow from wide moving jams, varying
the jam density ρj of the wide moving jams between 2 and 3
km. The three diﬀerent curves correspond to diﬀerent values
of free ﬂow density ρf in the region between 0 and 2 km and
3 and 7 km. As one can see from the plot, the outﬂow from
the wide moving jams only varies within a very small range of
ﬂow values and it is largely independent of the density of free
ﬂow. The typical outﬂow from wide moving jams for the cho-
sen parameter values is fout ≈ 3830 [1/h], which is far below
the maximum of stable free ﬂow f = 4994 [1/h].

VI. TRAFFIC FLOW AT BOTTLENECKS

In this section we study the behavior of traﬃc ﬂow in
the BVT model at a bottleneck of a highway. We focus
the discussion on a single simulation run of a two-lane
highway with periodic boundary conditions [21]. Again,
we use a longitudinal extension of the highway of 7 km
with homogeneous initial free ﬂow of density ρ = 75

FIG. 9: Formation of synchronized ﬂow from metastable free
ﬂow of density ρ = 60 [1/km] with an initial velocity pertur-
bation δv = −7 sin(πx) located between 2 an 3 km. Due to
the velocity perturbation, which can be seen in the ﬁgure as
vertical line at the density ρ = 60, the free ﬂow state breaks
down, leading to a complicated pattern of synchronized ﬂow
which covers a wide region of states in the fundamental di-
agram. Finally, moving jams form, which can in turn lead
to free ﬂow of lower density, thus reproducing the hysteresis
eﬀect observed in traﬃc dynamics. The plot shows all data
points corresponding to the constant time slices at t = i∆t,
where ∆t = 0.1 h, i = 0, .., 50.

[1/km]. We model the bottleneck simply by a velocity
modiﬁcation (velocity drop for free ﬂow) between 5 and
6 km, setting the velocity during the numerical simula-
tion to

v = v + (u(ρ) − v − 0.1)| sin(πx)|

(38)

We show the numerical evolution in Fig. 10. Despite
the simplicity of the initial setup the numerical evolution
shows a very complicated dynamics. As we will discuss
below, we observe the formation of synchronized ﬂow and
wide moving jams.

As a consequence of the bottleneck, the initial veloc-
ity drops to smaller values in the bottleneck region (dark
blue regions between 5 and 6 km in the velocity plot),
but also further upstream (dark blue regions between 4
and 5 km at about 0.1h). Both regions correspond to
synchronized ﬂow. The ﬁrst synchronized region stays
ﬁxed at the bottleneck, however the upstream front can
oscillate in time (e.g. in the velocity plot between 0.8 h
and 0.9 h). The second region of synchronized ﬂow trav-
els upstream.
It takes some time until an accentuated
wide moving jam with velocities close to zero forms. This

FIG. 10: Formation and propagation of wide moving jams.
The upper panel shows the evolution of the density, whereas
the lower panel shows the evolution of the velocity. At the
bottleneck located between 5 and 6 km, synchronized ﬂow
forms, which ﬁnally leads to a wide moving jam. This wide
moving jam moves with a velocity of about -15 [km/h] (i.e.
upstream) and swallows moving jams during this propagation.
It further travels through the bottleneck. See the text for a
detailed description.

wide moving jam travels further upstream and reenters
the numerical domain at 7 km after t ≈ 0.4 h due to the
periodic boundary conditions used in the numerical sim-
ulation. When reaching the bottleneck, it simply travels
through the ﬁrst synchronized region, thus becoming a
foreign wide moving jam. Note, that the velocity of the
downstream front of this wide moving jam is nearly con-
stant and has a value of about -15 km/h.

Between the wide moving jams we observe regions of
low density and high velocity, which correspond to free
ﬂow (see e.g. the region at x = 1 km and t = 0.7 h), and
smaller moving jams. As one can see from the plot there
are several regions (pinch regions) where these additional
moving jams form (see e.g. the region between 0 and 3
km at t ≈ 0.15 h or at about 1.5 km for t ≈ 0.45 h). For
these moving jams, the downstream front is in general
not as robust as for the wide moving jam described above.
At x = 3.5 km for t = 0.55 h, we observe the merging
of two moving jams, which are ﬁnally swallowed by the
wide moving jam at about x = 2 km for t = 0.75 h. We
also observe an example for the catch eﬀect of a narrow
moving jam, see the region at x = 5.5 km for t ≈ 0.15 h.

VII. DISCUSSION

The BVT model is a macroscopic, deterministic model,
which describes vehicular traﬃc ﬂow using standard
methods from continuum ﬂuid dynamics. It uses an equi-

librium ﬂow-density curve. In contrast to earlier models,
however, the parameter range of the eﬀective relaxation
coeﬃcient is extended to negative values. As a conse-
quence, the equilibrium ﬂow curve does not describe traf-
ﬁc states in the congested regime directly, but still deter-
mines the characteristic structure of the model. An ad-
ditional consequence of the negative eﬀective relaxation
coeﬃcient is the appearance of (two) additional branches
of trivial steady states. The characteristic structure, i.e.
the ﬁniteness of propagation speeds, restricts the stability
of these steady state solutions. The high ﬂow branch (i.e.
the tip of the reverse λ) is metastable against the forma-
tion of synchronized ﬂow for intermediate densities and
unstable for high densities. We interpret the metastable
branch of the tip of the reverse λ as metastable free ﬂow.
Stable free ﬂow, in contrast, corresponds to the stable
equilibrium ﬂow. The low ﬂow branch in the congested
regime (i.e. the jam line) is unstable against the forma-
tion of synchronized ﬂow for intermediate densities and
metastable for high densities. We interpret spatially ex-
tended solutions at the metastable branch of the jam line
as wide moving jams. We further identify the unstable
branches of the tip of the reverse λ and the jam line,
as well as the additional (steady state) solutions in the
congested regime, which can lead to very complicated
oscillatory patterns, as synchronized ﬂow. Thus, syn-
chronized ﬂow covers a wide region of congested states
in the fundamental diagram, without distinguishing be-

9

tween diﬀerent vehicle types and driver characteristics in
the model.

There are some additional results supporting the BVT
model. In particular, the model ensures that wide moving
jams do not form spontaneously from free ﬂow. When the
velocity drops below the critical value in free ﬂow, the
velocity is driven to even smaller values at that location
which results in a strong gradient in the velocity. It is
only after complicated oscillations have occurred, which
lead to a rearrangement of the density and the velocity,
that an extended steady state solution close to the jam
line, i.e. a wide moving jam, appears.

We further can reproduce the characteristic properties
of real wide moving jams with our model. For the chosen
parameter values, the downstream front of wide moving
jams travels with a nearly constant velocity of about 15
km/h upstream. Moreover, the outﬂow from wide mov-
ing jams is largely independent of the characteristics of
the wide moving jam, we obtain a typical outﬂow of 3830
vehicles/h. We further showed, that wide moving jams
travel through bottlenecks, whereas smaller moving jams
can be caught by a bottleneck.

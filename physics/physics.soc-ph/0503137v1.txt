Pricing options with VG model using FFT

Andrey Itkin∗

24th September 2013

Summary

We discuss why for VG model Carr-Madan’s FFT method blows up for certain values of the
model parameters when used to price European vanilla options. An alternative method originally
proposed by Lewis is considered which seems to work ﬁne for any value of the VG parameters.
Test examples are given to demonstrate an eﬃciency of this method.

This paper summarizes some results of the work originally initiated by Peter Carr. Peter proposed
to create a documented research prototype of the VG model that can be used as a reference
implementation. This should include:

There are several methods to price a European option under the VG model. One method uses
the closed form solution derived in [1]. Although the expression is analytic it requires computation
of modiﬁed Bessel functions, and, hence, may not be as fast as we would like our pricing model to
be. Therefore, initial work provided by Mike Konikov and Dilip Madan consisted of 2 steps. First,
the FFT method of Carr and Madan [2], nowadays almost standard in math ﬁnance, was applied
to the VG model [1] to price the European vanilla option since the characteristic function of the
log-return process has a very simple form. Unfortunately, it turned out that the methods blows up
at some values of the VG parameters. Second, Madan and Konikov developed yet another method
based on the deﬁnition of the VG process as being a time changed Brownian motion where the
time change is assumed independent of the Brownian motion. This method was described in detail
in [3] while has not been implemented yet.

Also Mike Konikov and I independently implemented a modiﬁcation of the FFT method - the
Fractional Fourier Transform, which is described in detail in [4, 5]. This method usually allows
acceleration of the pricing function by factor 8-10, while for the VG model it still demonstrates
same problem as the original FFT.

Below we discuss why the Carr and Madan FFT approach fails for the VG model, and propose

another method originally developed by Lewis [6] which seems to be free of such problems.

2 Carr-Madan’s FFT approach and the VG model

It was worked out for
Let us start with a short description of the Carr-Madan FFT method.
models where the characteristic function of underlying price process (St) is available. Therefore,
the vanilla options can be priced very eﬃciently using FFT as described in Carr and Madan [2].
The characteristic function of the price process is given by

φ(u, t) = E(eiuXt),

where Xt = log(St). Note that the above representation holds for all models and is not just
restricted to L´evy models where the characteristic functions have a time homogeneity constraint
that φ(u, t) = e−tψ(u), where ψ(u) is the L´evy characteristic exponent.

Once the characteristic function is available, then the vanilla call option can be priced using

The integral in the ﬁrst equation can be computed using FFT, and as a result we get call option

prices for a variety of strikes. For complete details, see Carr & Madan paper [2].
The put option values can just be constructed from Put-Call symmetry.
Parameter α in Eq. (2) must be positive. Usually α = 3 works well for various models. It is
important that the denominator in Eq. (11) has only imaginary roots while integration in Eq. (2)
is provided along real v. Thus, the integrand of Eq. (2) is well-behaved.

But as it turned out, this is not the case for the VG model. To show this let us consider the
European call option values obtained by Mike Konikov by computing FFT of the VG characteristic
function according to Eq. (2).

model at T = 0.02yrs, K = 90, σ = 0.01
obtained with FRFT.

model at T = 0.02yrs, K = 90, σ = 0.01
obtained with the adaptive integration.

≈

In Fig. 1 the results of that test obtained using the FRFT algorithm are given for strike K = 90,
2
maturity T = 0.02 yrs and volatility σ = 0.01. It is seen that at positive coeﬃcients of skew Θ
and coeﬃcients of kurtosis ν
0.5 the option value has a delta-function-wise pick that doesn’t
seem to be a real option value behavior. In Fig. 2 similar results are obtained using a diﬀerent
method of evaluation of the integral in Eq. (2) - an adaptive integration. Eventually, in Fig. 3 same
test was provided using a standard FFT method. The results look quite diﬀerent that allows a
guess that something is wrong with FRFT and the adaptive integration. One could also note that
this test plays with an option with a very short maturity. Therefore, to let us make another test
with a longer maturity. In Fig. 4-6 the results of the test that uses same integration procedures,
but for the option with K = 90, T = 1, σ = 1, are presented. It is seen that for longer maturities

≈

FFT also blows up almost at the same region of the model parameters. Moreover, it occurs not
only at positive value of the skew coeﬃcient but at negative as well. Thus, the problem lies not
in the numerical method that was used to evaluate the integral in the Eq. (2), but in the integral
itself.

Figure 3: European option values in VG
model at T = 0.02yrs, K = 90, σ = 0.01
obtained with FFT.

Figure 4: European option values in VG
model at T = 1.0yrs, K = 90, σ = 1.0
obtained with the FFT.

To show this let us brieﬂy describe the main features of the model. The Variance Gamma
model (VG for short) with parameter vector (σ, ν, θ) assumes that the forward price satisﬁes the
following equation

ln Ft = ln F0 + Xt + ωt,

where

Xt = θγt(1, ν) + σWγt(1,ν),
where γt(1, ν) is a Gamma process playing the role of time in this case, and ω is chosen to make Ft
a martingale. Conditioning on time change like in Romano-Touzi for stochastic volatility models,
we can derive both formula for the characteristic function of Xt (and, hence, Ft), and the value of
a vanilla European option. First, the density for our Gamma process is

where u
(α + 1)i. At small T close to zero the second term in the denominator of the Eq. (13)
is close to 1. Therefore at small T the denominator has no real roots. To understand what happens
at larger maturities, let us put T = 0.8, ν = 0.1, α = 3, σ = 1 and see how the denominator behaves
as a function of v and Θ. The results of this test obtained with the help of Mathematica package
are given in Fig 7.

at T = 0.8, ν = 0.1, α = 3, σ = 1 as a
function of v and Θ.

Figure 8: Denominator of the Eq. (13)
at T = 0.8, ν = 0.1, α = 3, v = 0 as a
function of σ and Θ.

It is seen that at v = 0 at positive Θ the characteristic function has a singularity. To investigate
it in more detail, we assume v = 0 and plot the denominator as a function of σ and Θ (see Fig. ??).

As follows from this Figure in the interval 0 < σ < 2 there exists a value of Θ that makes the
integrand in the Eq. (13) singular. This means that singularity of the integrand can not be
eliminated, and thus the Carr-Madan FFT method can not be used together with the VG model
for pricing European vanilla options. Using FRFT or adaptive integration that both are slight
modiﬁcations of the FFT, also doesn’t help.

Note that for the VG model the authors of [2] derived condition which keeps the characteristic

function to be ﬁnite, that reads

(14)

Also as can be seen, for Θ, ν and σ corresponding to the above mentioned tests α becomes

negative that doesn’t allow using this method to price the options in terms of strike.

In order to solve these problems one needs to ﬁnd another way how to regularize the integrand,

i.e. eliminate doing it in the way as Carr and Madan did it using a regularization factor e−αk.

3 Lewis’s regularization

Another approach of how to apply FFT to the pricing of European options was proposed by Alan
Lewis [6]. Lewis notes that a general integral representation of the European call option value with
a vanilla payoﬀ is

CT (x0, K) = e

−rT

(ex

K)+ q(x, x0, T )dx,

(15)

where x = log ST is a stock price that under a pricing measure evolves as ST = S0 exp[(r

−
E[exp(iuXT )] = 1, and q is the density of the log-return distribution x.

q)T +XT ,
q is the cost of carry, T is the expiration time for some option, XT is some Levy process satisfying

The central point of the Lewis’s work is to represent the Eq. (15) as a convolution integral and

where the hat over function denotes its Fourier transform.

The idea behind this formula is that the Fourier transform of a transition probability density
for a Levy process to reach Xt = x after the elapse of time t is a well-known characteristic
function, which plays an important role in mathematical ﬁnance. For Levy processes it is φt(u) =
E[exp(iuXt)], u

This can be immediately recognized as a standard inverse Fourier transform, and by derivation

get the value of the integral.

In Fig. 9 -10 the results of the European vanilla option pricing with the VG model conducted
by using this new FFT method are displayed. Two test has been provided with parameters T = 1
yr, K = 90, σ = 0.1 (Fig. 9) and T = 1 yr, K = 90, σ = 0.5 (Fig. 10). It is seen that the option
value surface is regular in both cases. Zero values indicates that region, where the VG constrain
Eq. (12) is not respected. The higher values of σ and Θ are the lower values of ν are required
to obey this constraint. Therefore, at higher values of ν the model is not deﬁned that produces
irregularity in the graph. This eﬀect is better observable in Fig. 11 that is obtained by rotation of
the Fig. 10. The above means that the new FFT method can be used with no essential problem.
A generalization of this method for FRFT is also straightforward.

In the region of the VG parameters value where an application of Carr-Madan FFT procedure
doesn’t cause the problem the results of that method are almost identical to what the described
above method gives. An example of such a comparison is given in Fig. 12 (my NewFFT Matlab
code vs Mike’s FFT code). It is seen that the diﬀerence is of the order of 10−7.

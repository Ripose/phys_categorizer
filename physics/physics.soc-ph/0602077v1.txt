On the universality of the scaling of ﬂuctuations in traﬃc on complex networks

We study the scaling of ﬂuctuations with the mean of traﬃc in complex networks using a model
where the arrival and departure of “packets” follow exponential distributions, and the processing
capability of nodes is either unlimited or ﬁnite. The model presents a wide variety of exponents
between 1/2 and 1 for this scaling, revealing their dependence on the few parameters considered,
and questioning the existence of universality classes. We also report the experimental scaling of the
ﬂuctuations in the Internet for the Abilene backbone network. We found scaling exponents between
0.71 and 0.86 that do not ﬁt with the exponent 1/2 reported in the literature.

Recently, the theory of complex networks has started
to cope with the problem of dynamics on networks. After
much work devoted to the understanding of the network
topology [1], the physics community has begun to de-
velop models to uncover the phenomena observed in the
dynamics on complex networks. Some stylized models of
traﬃc ﬂow in complex networks [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
11] can be used to gain intuition about complex networks
dynamics, and to determine the leading parameters of the
dynamic processes related to the network topology.

The main results obtained up to now concerning traﬃc
ﬂow in complex networks, are related to the determina-
tion of bounds for this ﬂow to become congested. Never-
theless, traﬃc on real complex networks, as for example
the Internet, is not driven by congestion processes but
by large ﬂuctuations of the ”normal” traﬃc behavior. In
the case of the Internet, the understanding of the physi-
cal laws governing the nature of traﬃc is crucial because
its implications in design, control and speed of the whole
network [12].

In a couple of recent articles, Menezes and Barabasi
propose a model to understand the origin of ﬂuctuations
in traﬃc processes in a number of real world systems,
including the Internet, the world wide web, and highway
networks [13, 14]. All of these systems can be repre-
sented at an abstract level as networks in which pack-
ets travel from one node to another, packets being real
data packets or bits in the Internet, ﬁles in the world
wide web, and vehicles in road networks. In particular,
the authors considered the relationship between the av-
erage number of packets hfii processed by nodes during
a certain time interval, and the standard deviation σi of
this quantity. They ﬁnd that there are two classes of
universality in this relationship for real systems. In the
Internet, σ scales as hf i1/2, whereas σ scales as hf i for
the world wide web and highway networks. Based on
a stylized model of random walkers throughout the net-
work, they conclude that this diﬀerence is due to the fact
that the dynamics of the Internet is dominated by “inter-
nal noise” whereas the dynamics of the world wide web
and highway networks is dominated by the demands of

users, that is “external noise”. In the abstraction process
proposed by the authors, they overlook what is probably
one of the most important factors in the dynamics of traf-
ﬁc on networks—the limited capacity of nodes to handle
packets simultaneously, which results in packet-packet in-
teractions and, eventually, in large ﬂuctuations or even
network congestion [2, 3].

In this Letter we show that simple considerations re-
garding the persistence of packets ﬂowing the network,
the limitation of nodes to handle information, and the
time window where statistics are performed, account for
diﬀerent scalings of the ﬂuctuations in traﬃc on complex
networks. The main results obtained are: (i) Maintain-
ing the total traﬃc on the network constant, diﬀerent
scaling laws arise depending on the relation between the
ratio of packet input and the steps these packets per-
form before disappear; (ii) The time window aﬀects the
scaling exponent of the ﬂuctuations in such a way that,
for a small enough time window the scaling trivially sat-
isﬁes σ ∼ hf i1/2 always, no matter the dynamic pro-
cess. When the time window is large enough, the rest
of parameters will provide the precise scaling between
α = 1/2 and α = 1 where α refers to the scaling exponent
σ ∼ hf iα; (iii) The eﬀect of the packet-packet interaction
(queue system) account for diﬀerent scaling exponents
as well; (iv) We ﬁnd that within this framework there is
not enough evidence for deriving universality classes. We
have checked the scaling for data ﬂowing on the Abilene
backbone network, and show that the scaling exponent
is diﬀerent from 1/2.

To understand the origin of the scaling relations for the
ﬂuctuations in networks, let us consider the behavior of
a single node—for example, a toll plaza in a highway—
trying to satisfy demands from users—vehicles arriving
to the toll–. As we learn from queueing theory [15], two
stochastic processes fully determine the behavior of the
node: (i) the arrival process by which new packets arrive
to the node, and (ii) the service process by which the
node satisﬁes the demands of the users, that is, forwards
the packets. The most common queue model corresponds
to the M/M/1 queueing system, where the randomness

of the packets generation assumes a random (Poisson)
arrival pattern [16] and the service distribution assumes
a random (exponential) time [18].

Taking into account these considerations, we propose
to model the traﬃc process in a complex network of N
nodes as N queue systems of type M/M/1, and a random
walk simulation of packets movement on the network.
The arrival process of packets to the network is controlled
by a Poisson distribution with parameter λ, each packet
enters the network at a random selected node. Once the
packet arrives to the node enters a queue. The delivery
of the packets in the queue is controlled by an exponen-
tial distribution of service times with parameter µ.
In
our model, the packets will perform S random steps in
the network before disappearing, being then S a mea-
sure of the persistence of packets in the network. This
dynamics is performed in continuous time, assuming that
the time expended by packets traveling through a link is
negligible.

The system achieves a stationary state whenever the
arrival rate of packets at each node is lower than or equal
to the delivery rate, otherwise the system congests. The
arrival rate at each node i is topology dependent and fol-
lows a distribution whose mean is λef
i = Biλ where Bi
is the algorithmic betweenness of node i. Bi is deﬁned
as the relative number of paths in the network that go
through node i given a speciﬁc routing algorithm [2]. As
a direct consequence, the node with maximum algorith-
mic betweenness B∗ determines the onset of congestion.
We will focus on the average number of packets hfii pro-
cessed by nodes during a certain time interval P , and the
standard deviation σi of this quantity.
Selecting a value of P ≪ 1/λef

∗ = 1/(B∗λ), we will
always observe the scaling σ ∼ hf i1/2, regardless of other
parameters. Due to the value of P selected, the nodes will
deliver either one packet or none, at each time interval.
Suppose that during a number n1 of intervals of length
P the node deliver a packet whereas it does not deliver
during a number of intervals n0 = n − n1, where n is the
number of samples for the statistics.
In this situation
we also have n0 ≫ n1. Therefore, the average and the
standard deviation read

hf i = n1/n

(1)

σ = [

(cid:2)n1(1 − hf i)2 + n0hf i2

(cid:3)]1/2

n

which can be simpliﬁed to

σ = [(1 − hf i)hf i]1/2

(2)

But, in the current scenario, the average ﬂow is hf i ≪
1 and then we recover the σ ∼ hf i1/2 scaling law. Oth-
erwise, this argument cannot be applied, and the scaling
value will be inﬂuenced by the rest of parameters of the
model.

FIG. 1: (Color online) Value of the exponent α versus the time
window of size P , for a ﬁxed λef
∗ = 1/3 and diﬀerent values
of the persistence of packets in the network S. The shadowed
area highlights the region of P in which the exponent α =
1/2 always appears. The simulation is performed in a scale-
free network with exponent for the degree distribution γ = 3
of 1000 nodes [20]. We have observed the same results for
larger SF networks at a subset of values of P , however the
computational cost for the whole set of P values used in the
plot becomes prohibitive.

In Fig.1 we show the behavior of the scaling exponent α
as a function of the time intervals length P over which the
averages were taken, for a ﬁxed λef
∗ = 1/3. We observe
(shadowed area) that the exponent is always 1/2 when
the interval length is small enough. Indeed, from the data
∼ 0.01/λef
used the exponent 1/2 stands for values of P <
∗ .
Let us now assume that the sampling of the data is
performed at intervals of length P ≫ 1/λef
In this
∗ .
case, we expect the scaling of ﬂuctuations in the system,
beyond the eﬀect of the sampling process, to be revealed.
We analyze the behavior of the system varying the rate
of injection of packets into the system λ and the number
of steps S each node performs before it disappears. We
ﬁrst consider that the service rate µ → ∞. In this case,
the eﬀect of queues is minimized and then no interaction
between packets is accounted for. The total traﬃc T ,
number of packets ﬂowing through the network per unit
time, is determined by the Poisson process with mean
hT i = λS.

Keeping the total traﬃc mean hT i ﬁxed, we can con-
trol the variability of the local traﬃc incoming to a node
by varying the values of λ and S proportionally. In Fig 2.
we show the scaling exponent transition between α = 1/2
and α = 1. This plot recovers the results depicted in [13],
although the explanation should be reconsidered in the
new scenario. The transition of exponent from α = 1/2
to α = 1 is obtained here simply by increasing the num-
ber of steps S the packet performs on the network while
maintaining the mean value of the total traﬃc (i.e. de-
creasing proportionally the injection ratio λ). This con-
tradict the interpretation in [13] because increasing the

number of steps in the network increases ”internal traﬃc”
while decreasing the injection of packets is a decrement of
”external” traﬃc in this scenario. Nevertheless both re-
sults are coherent at this point concerning the scaling of
ﬂuctuations. Our interpretation of this transition is the
following: for the same total traﬃc on the network, the
nature of ﬂuctuations is related to the number of steps
S the packets perform on the network. When the num-
ber of steps is small enough the behavior of ﬂuctuations
is akin a random deposition process independent of the
topology of the network, λef
i ≈ λ. When the number of
steps in the network grows, the topology induces dynam-
ical correlations that aﬀect the scaling of ﬂuctuations via
the algorithmic betweenness, λef

i ≈ λBi.

We extend the simple model where queues are ne-
glected, to the more realistic situation when queues are
persistent. The introduction of queues in the system, in
our model, is controlled by the parameter µ (rate of ser-
vice). The possible values of µ are constrained by the
onset of congestion i.e. µ > λef
∗ , otherwise congestion
appears at those nodes with B∗, because of the arrival of
more packets than those that can be delivered. We inves-
tigate those values of µ near the onset of congestion to
reveal the eﬀect of queues in the scaling properties of the
system. When congestion occurs, the queues correspond-
ing to those nodes with B∗ will have always more packets
that those than can be delivered in a period P . That
means that the number of packets delivered by these
nodes will be controlled exclusively by the service rate µ,
i.e. the variance scaling with respect to the mean ﬂow at
these nodes will be again ﬁtted by α = 1/2 corresponding
to the exponential service distribution. Close to the onset

of congestion we approach the situation where the scal-
ing exponent α = 1/2 should be recovered, however the
possibility that in some periods of time the queues will be
unoccupied increases as we go away from the congested
regime, thus a new transition in the scaling exponent as
a function µ is expected. In Fig. 3 we plot the scaling
exponent transition as a function of µ for a ﬁxed value
of λef
∗ = 1/3. In this situation the onset of congestion is
determined by the critical value µc = 1/3. Note that for
values below µc some nodes of the network collapse and
then gradually the rest of the nodes in the network. In
this region, shadowed area of Fig. 3 the system enters
the congestion regime progressively. The transition on
the scaling exponent depicted in Fig. 3 is also aﬀected
by the time window size P , we plotted the transition for
T = 102, 103 and 104. We observe that as P increases,
the transition becomes sharper.
Indeed in the limit of
T → ∞ we conjecture that the transition could be dis-
continuous, and could reﬂect a ﬁrst order phase transition
[21] as observed in other traﬃc models [22], although we
can not claim that this discontinuity will occur sharply
from 1 to 1/2.

Up to now, we have show that a simple traﬃc model
where the injection of packets to the system follows a
Poisson distribution, can account for diﬀerent scaling ex-
ponents α depending on the parameters λ, µ, S and the
time period P were the statistics are performed. These
results lead us to suspect that the scaling of ﬂuctuations
in real systems must be aﬀected by these parameters as
well. This cast doubts on the universality predicted in
[13]. Indeed, this non-universality has been also claimed
in the exponent of ﬂuctuations when studying the data
ﬂow between stocks in NYSE market [23]. To corrob-
orate our doubts about universality on the scaling of
ﬂuctuations in complex networks, we have studied the
Internet traﬃc between routers of the Abilene backbone

We collected data from the 112 available router inter-
faces (links). We gather information of the number of
packets that exit through each router interface between
September 15th and November 15th of 2005, at intervals
of 5 minutes. The scaling σ ∼ hf iα shows exponents that
range from α = 0.71 to α = 0.86, signiﬁcantly diﬀerent
from the exponent 1/2 presented in [13]. The interpre-
tation of these exponents in the context of our stylized
model is that the Abilene backbone is far from the onset
of congestion for the interface with maximum algorith-
mic betweenness, and seems compatible with the mean
rate of utilization of the interfaces in this backbone that
is usually below 30%.

Summarizing, we have presented a simple model of
traﬃc in complex networks that capture the essential pa-
rameters governing the dynamical process. The model
shows a scaling relationship between σ and hf i whose
exponent depends on the parameters considered as well
as on the time window in which the statistics are per-
formed. Moreover we have shown that the corresponding
exponent for the scaling of ﬂuctuations in the Internet
Abilene backbone network is diﬀerent from 1/2 as stated
in previous works, corroborating by exclusion that the
universality on the scaling of ﬂuctuations in complex net-
works should be questioned.

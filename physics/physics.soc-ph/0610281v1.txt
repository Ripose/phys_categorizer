Abstract

We present a family of networks, expanded deterministic Apollo-
nian networks, which are a generalization of the Apollonian networks
and are simultaneously scale-free, small-world, and highly clustered.
We introduce a labeling of their vertices that allows to determine a
shortest path routing between any two vertices of the network based
only on the labels.

1 Introduction

In these last few years there has been a growing interest in the study of
complex networks [2, 20, 31, 11], which can help to describe many social,
biological, and communication systems, such as co-author networks
[30],
sexual networks [29], metabolic networks [27], protein networks in the cell
[26], Internet [23], and the World Wide Web [4]. Extensive observational
studies show that many real-life networks have at least three important com-
mon statistical characteristics: the degree distribution exhibits a power law
tail with an exponent taking a value between 2 and 3 (scale-free); nodes hav-
ing a common neighbor are far more likely to be linked to each other than
are two nodes selected randomly (highly clustered ); the expected number of
links needed to go from one arbitrarily selected node to another one is low
(small-world property).

These empirical ﬁndings have lead to a new kind of network models [2,
20, 31, 11]. The research on these new models was started by the two semi-
nal papers by Watts and Strogatz on small-world networks [32] and Barab´asi
and Albert on scale-free networks [7]. A wide variety of network models and
mechanisms, including initial attractiveness [21], nonlinear preferential at-
tachment [28], aging and cost [5], competitive dynamics [9], edge rewiring [3]
and removal [19], duplication [12], which may represent processes realistically
taking place in real-life systems, have been proposed.

Recently, based on the classical Apollonian packing, Andrade et al. intro-
duced Apollonian networks [6] which were simultaneously proposed by Doye
and Massen in [22]. Apollonian networks belong to a deterministic type of
networks studied earlier in Refs. [8, 17, 18, 16, 15] which have received much
interest recently [40, 35, 33, 37, 38]. Two-dimensional Apollonian networks
are simultaneously scale-free, small-world, Euclidean, space ﬁlling, and with
matching graphs [6, 40]. They may provide valuable insight into real-life net-

3

works; moreover, they are maximal planar graphs and this property is of par-
ticular interest for the layout of printed circuits and related problems [6, 40].
More recently, some interesting dynamical processes [40, 37, 25], such as
percolation [40], epidemic spreading [40], synchronization [37], and random
walks [25], taking place on these networks have been also investigated.

Networks are composed of vertices (nodes) and edges (links) and are very
often studied considering branch of discrete mathematics known as graph
theory. One active subject in graph theory is graph labeling [24]. This is
not only due to its theoretical importance but also because of the wide range
of applications in many ﬁelds [10], such as x-rays, crystallography, coding
theory, radar, astronomy, circuit design, and communication design.

In this paper we present an extension of the general high dimensional
Apollonian networks [6, 22, 33] which includes the deterministic small-world
network introduced in [36]. We give a vertex labeling, so that queries for the
shortest path between any two vertices can be eﬃciently answered thanks
to it. Finding shortest paths in networks is a well-studied and important
problem with also many applications [1]. Our labeling may be useful in
aspects such as network optimization and information dissemination, which
are directly related to the problem of ﬁnding shortest paths between all pairs
of vertices of the network.

2 Expanded Apollonian networks

In this section we present a network model deﬁned in a iterative way. The
model, which we call expanded Apollonian network (EAN), is an extension of
the general high dimensional Apollonian network [6, 22, 33] which includes
the deterministic small-world network introduced in [36].

The networks, denoted by A(d, t) after t iterations with d ≥ 1 and t ≥ 0,
are constructed as follows. For t = 0, A(d, 0) is a complete graph Kd+2 (or
(d + 2)-clique). For t ≥ 1, A(d, t) is obtained from A(d, t − 1). For each of
the existing subgraphs of A(d, t − 1) that is isomorphic to a (d + 1)-clique
and created at step t − 1, a new vertex is created and connected to all the
vertices of this subgraph. Figure 1 shows the network growing process for
the particular case where d = 2.

Let nv(t) and ne(t) denote the number of vertices and edges created at
step t, respectively. According to the network construction, one can see
that at step ti (ti > 1) the number of newly introduced vertices and edges

ﬁrst two steps of growing process.

is nv(ti) = (d + 2)(d + 1)ti−1 and ne(ti) = (d + 2)(d + 1)ti. From these
results, we can easily compute the total number of vertices Nt and edges Et
and Et = (d + 2)(d + 1) 2(d+1)t+d−2
at step t, which are Nt = (d+2)[(d+1)t+d−1]
,
respectively. So for large t, the average degree kt = 2Et
is approximately
Nt
2(d + 1).

2d

d

This general model includes existing models, as listed below.
Indeed, when d = 1, the network is the deterministic small-world net-
work (DSWN) introduced in [36] and further generalized in [34]. DSWN is
an exponential network, its degree distribution P (k) is an exponential of a
power of degree k. For a node of degree k, the exact clustering coeﬃcient
is 2
k . The average clustering coeﬃcient of DSWN is ln 2, which approaches
to a high constant value 0.6931. The average path length of DSWN grows
logarithmically with the number of network vertices [39].

When d ≥ 2, the networks are exactly the same as the high-dimensional
Apollonian networks (HDAN) with d indicating the dimension [6, 22, 33, 38].
HDAN present the typical characteristics of real-life networks in nature and
society, and their main topological properties are controlled by dimension d.
They have a power law degree distribution with exponent γ = 1 + ln(d+1)
belonging to the interval between 2 and 3 [6, 22, 33, 38]. For any individual
vertex in HDAN, its clustering coeﬃcient C(k) is also inversely proportional

ln d

5

to its degree k as C(k) = 2d(k− d+1
2 )
. The mean value C of clustering coeﬃcient
k(k−1)
of all vertices in HDAN is very large and is an increasing function of d. For
instance, in the special cases where d = 2 and d = 3, C asymptotically reaches
values 0.8284 and 0.8852, respectively. In addition, HDAN are small worlds.
The diameter of HDAN, deﬁned as the longest shortest distance between all
pairs of vertices, increases logarithmically with the number of vertices. So,
the EAN model exhibits a transition from an exponential network (d = 1)
to scale-free networks (d ≥ 2).

3 Vertex labeling

Vertex labeling of a network is an assignment of labels to all the vertices in
the network. In most applications, labels are nonnegative integers, though
in general real numbers could be used [24]. In this section, we describe a way
to label the vertices of A(d, t), for any d ≥ 1 and t ≥ 0, such that a routing
by shortest paths between any two vertices of A(d, t) can be deduced from
the labels. We note that a more general result on shortest paths routing
of graphs with given treewidth is given in [13]. However, here we address
the more speciﬁc case of the expanded Apollonian networks A(d, t). In what
follows, we will denote L(v) as the label of vertex v, for any vertex v belonging
to A(d, t).

Here the labeling idea, inspired from [14], is to assign to any vertex v
created at step t ≥ 1 a label of length t, in the form of a word of t digits,
each digit being an integer between 1 and d + 2 (the vertices obtained at step
t = 0, i.e. the vertices of the initial (d + 2)-clique A(d, 0), are assigned a
special label). More precisely, the labeling of any vertex v of A(d, t) is done
thanks to the following rules:

• Label the vertices of the initial (d + 2)-clique A(d, 0) arbitrarily, with

labels 1′, 2′ . . . (d + 2)′.

• At any step t ≥ 1, when a new vertex v is added and joined to all

vertices of a clique Kd+1:

1. If v is connected to d + 1 vertices of the initial (d + 2)-clique, then
L(v) = l, where l′ is the only vertex of the initial (d + 2)-clique
that does not belong to this (d + 1)-clique.

6

2. If not, then v is connected to w1, w2 . . . wd+1, where at least one
of the wi’s is not a vertex of the initial (d + 2)-clique. Thus, any
such vertex has a label L(wi) = s1,is2,i . . . sk,i. W.l.o.g., let w1
be the vertex not belonging to the initial (d + 2)-clique with the
longest label. In that case, we give vertex v the label L(v) deﬁned
as follows: L(v) = α · L(w1), where 1 ≤ α ≤ d + 2 is the only
integer not appearing as ﬁrst digit in the labels of w1, w2 . . . wd+1,
that is α = {1, 2 . . . d, d + 1, d + 2}/ ∪d+1
i=1 s1,i (the fact that α is
unique will be proved by Property 1 below).

Such a labeling is illustrated in Figure 2. In the upper part of this ﬁgure,
we label the vertices of A(d, t), for d = 1 and up to t = 3. We see that
vertex u, created at step 1, has label L(u) = 2 because it is not connected to
vertex 2′ of the initial 3-clique (triangle). Vertex w is is not connected to any
vertex of the initial 3-clique, its label is ﬁrst composed of the only digit not
appearing as ﬁrst digit of its neighbors (in this case, 1), concatenated with
the longest label of its neighbors (in this case, 23). Analogously, in the lower
part of Figure 2 , where, for sake of clarity, only a part of A(2, 3) is drawn,
the vertices have been labeled. For the same reasons, we can see that vertex
u has label L(u) = 4, while w has label L(w) = 234.

Thus, we see that for any t ≥ 1, any vertex vt created at step t has a
unique label, and that for any vertex v created at step t ≥ 1, L(v) = s1s2 . . . st
is of length t, where each digit sj satisﬁes 1 ≤ sj ≤ d + 2 ; while the vertices
created at step 0 have length 1 (these are the l′, 1 ≤ l ≤ d + 2).

We note that since for any step t ≥ 1, the number of vertices that are
added to the expanded Apollonian networks is equal to (d + 2)(d + 1)t−1,
the labeling we propose is optimal in the sense that each label L(vt) of a
vertex created at step t is a (d + 2)-ary word of length t. Globally, any
vertex of A(d, t) is assigned a label of length O(logd+2 t) ; since there are
Nt = (d+2) (d+1)t+d−1
vertices in A(d, t), we can see that, overall, the labeling
d
is optimal as well.

Next, we give three properties about the above labeling. Property 1
ensures that our labeling is deterministic. Property 2 is a tool to prove
Property 3, the latter being important to show that our routing protocol is
valid and of shortest paths.

Property 1 In A(d, t), for any (d + 2)-clique induced by vertices w1, w2
. . . wd+2, every integer 1 ≤ i ≤ d + 2 appears exactly once as the ﬁrst digit
of the label of a wj.

of the vertices of A(2, 3)

Proof. By induction on t. When t = 1, the property is true by construc-
tion. Suppose now that the property is true for any t′ < t, and let us then
show it is true for t. Any (d + 2)-clique in A(d, t) is composed of exactly
one vertex v created at a given step t1, and d + 1 vertices w1, w2, . . . wd+1
created at steps strictly less than t1.
If t1 < t, then the property is true
by induction hypothesis. If t1 = t, we suppose that wd+2 is connected to a
(d + 1)-clique C composed of w1, w2, . . . wd+1. It is clear that C did not exist
at step t − 1. In other words, one of the wi’s, say w1, has been created at step
t − 1, based on d + 1 vertices w2, w3 . . . wd+1 and x. By induction hypothesis,
each integer 1 ≤ i ≤ d + 2 appears exactly once as ﬁrst digit of the labels of
w1, w2, w3 . . . wd+1, x. However, by construction, the ﬁrst digit of L(wd+2) is
the ﬁrst digit of L(x). Thus we conclude that each integer 1 ≤ i ≤ d + 2 also
appears exactly once as ﬁrst digit of the labels of w1, w2, w3 . . . wd+1, wd+2,
and the result is proved by induction.

Property 2 Let vt be a vertex of A(d, t) created at step t ≥ 1. Among
the vertices w1, w2, . . . wd+1 forming the (d + 1)-clique that generated vt, let
w1, w2 . . . wk, k ≤ d + 1, be the vertices that do not belong to the initial
(d + 2)-clique. Then L(vt) is a superstring of L(wi) for all 1 ≤ i ≤ k.

Proof. By induction on t. When t = 1, any vertex v1 created at step 1
is connected to vertices of the initial (d + 2)-clique only. Thus the result is
true. Now suppose the result is true for any 1 ≤ t′ ≤ t − 1, t ≥ 2, and let us
prove it is then true for t. For this, we consider a vertex vt created at step
t, and the (d + 1)-clique C it is connected to. Suppose vt is a neighbor of wp
which was created at step t − 1. However, wp was created itself thanks to a
(d + 1)-clique, say C′, composed of vertices x1, x2 . . . xd+1. W.l.o.g., suppose
that k ≤ d + 1 such vertices, x1, x2 . . . xk do not belong to the initial (d + 2)-
clique. By induction hypothesis, L(xi) ⊆ L(wp) for any 1 ≤ i ≤ k. Hence,
in C, wp is the vertex not belonging to the initial (d + 2)-clique that has the
longest label. By construction of L(vt), we have that L(wp) ⊆ L(vt), thus
we also conclude that L(xi) ⊆ L(vt) for any 1 ≤ i ≤ k. Thus L(vt) is a
superstring of the labels of any vertex of C that does not belong to the initial
(d + 2)-clique, and the result is proved by induction.

Property 3 Let vt be a vertex of A(d, t) created at step t ≥ 1. For any
1 ≤ i ≤ d + 2, if i 6∈ L(vt), then vt is a neighbor of a vertex v′ of the initial
(d + 2)-clique, such that L(v′) = i′.

Proof. By induction on t. When t = 1, any vertex v1 constructed at step
1 is assigned label i, where i′ is the only vertex of the initial (d + 2)-clique vt
is not connected to ; thus, by construction, the property is satisﬁed.

9

Now we suppose that the property is true for any 1 ≤ t′ ≤ t − 1, t ≥ 2,
and we will show it then holds for t as well. As for the previous property, we
consider a vertex vt created at step t, and the (d + 1)-clique C it is connected
to.

Suppose vt is connected to a vertex wt−1 that was created at step t − 1.
However, wt−1 was created itself thanks to a (d + 1)-clique C′ composed of
vertices x1, x2 . . . xd+1. Among those d + 1 vertices, only one, say xp, does
not belong to C. W.l.o.g., suppose that k ≤ d + 1 such vertices, x1, x2 . . . xk
do not belong to the initial (d + 2)-clique. Now suppose that i 6∈ L(vt) ; then
i appears as the ﬁrst digit of one of the L(xj)’s, j ∈ [1, p − 1] S[p + 1, d + 1],
or of L(wt−1) (by Property 1). However, L(xj) ⊆ L(wt−1) ⊆ L(vt) for any
1 ≤ j ≤ k (by Property 2). Thus, neither wt−1 nor any vertex among the
xj’s, 1 ≤ j ≤ k contains the digit i in its label. Hence, only a vertex y from
the initial (d + 2)-clique can have i in its label, and thus L(y) = i′. Hence it
suﬃces to show that vt and y are neighbors to prove the property. The only
case for which this would not happen is when y = xp ; we will show that this
is not possible. Indeed, by construction of the labels, the ﬁrst digit of L(vt) is
the only integer not appearing as ﬁrst digit of the labels of the vertices of C,
that is wt−1, x1, x2 . . . xp−1, xp+1 . . . xd+1. However, the fact that we suppose
y = xp means that no vertex of C contains i in its label. Thus this would
mean that the ﬁrst digit of L(vt) is i, a contradiction. Thus, vt is connected
to y with L(y) = i′, and the induction is proved.

4 Routing by shortest path

Now we describe the routing protocol between any two vertices u and v of
A(d, t), with labels respectively equal to L(u) and L(v). We note that since
A(d, 0) is isomorphic to the complete graph Kd+2, we can assume t ≥ 1. The
routing protocol is special here in the sense that the routing is done both
from u and v, until they reach a common vertex. Hence, the routing strategy
will be used simultaneously from u and from v. In order to ﬁnd a shortest
path between any two vertices u and v, the routing protocol is as follows.
First we compute the longest common suﬃx LCS(L(u), L(v)) of L(u) and
L(v), then we distinguish two cases:

1. If LCS(L(u), L(v)) = ∅:

(a) Simultaneously from u and v (say, from u): let u = u0 and go from

10

ui to ui+1, i ≥ 0 where ui+1 is the neighbor of ui with shortest
label.

(b) Stop when uk is a neighbor of the initial (d + 2)-clique.

Let ¯L(uk) (resp. ¯L(vk′)) be the integers not present in L(uk) (resp.
L(vk′)), and let S = ¯L(uk) ∩ ¯L(vk′).

i. If S 6= ∅, pick any l ∈ S, and close the path by taking the

edge from uk to l′, and the edge from l′ to vk′.
ii. If S = ∅, route from uk to any neighbor l′

1 (belonging to
the initial (d + 2)-clique) of uk, and do similarly from vk′ to
a neighbor l′
2 (belonging to the initial (d + 2)-clique) of vk′.
Then, take the edge from l′
2 and thus close the path from
u to v.

1 to l′

2. If LCS(L(u), L(v)) 6= ∅, then let us call least common clique of u
and v, or LCC(u, v), the (d + 2)-clique composed of the vertex with
label LCS(L(u), L(v)) and the d + 1 vertices forming the (d + 1)-clique
that generated the vertex of label LCS(L(u), L(v)). We simultaneously
route from u and v to (respectively) uk and vk′, going each time to the
neighbor with LCS(L(u), L(v)) as label suﬃx, and having the shortest
label. Similarly as above, we stop at uk (resp. vk′), where uk (resp. vk′)
is the ﬁrst of the ui’s (resp. of the vj’s) to be a neighbor of LCC(u, v).
Then there are two subcases, depending on Q = L(uk) ∩ L(vk′).

(a) If Q 6= ∅, close the path by going to any vertex w with label l,

l ∈ Q.

(b) If Q = ∅, then route from uk (resp. vk′) to any neighbor w1 (resp.
w2) in LCC(u, v), and close the path by taking the edge (w1, w2),
which exists since both vertices w1 and w2 belong to the same
clique LCC(u, v).

Proposition 1 The above mentioned routing algorithm is valid, and of

shortest paths.

Proof. Let us ﬁrst give the main ideas for the validity of the above
routing protocol. Take any two vertices u and v. By construction of L(u)
and L(v), the longest common suﬃx LCS(L(u), L(v)) indicates to which
(d + 2)-clique u and v have to go. We can consider this as a way for u and v
to reach their least common ancestor in the graph of cliques induced by the

11

construction of A(d, t), or the “least common clique”. In Case (i), this least
common clique is the initial (d + 2)-clique ; thus, u and v have to get back
to it. In Case (ii), the shortest path does not go through the initial (d + 2)-
clique, and the least common clique of u and v, say LCC(u, v), is indicated
by the longest common suﬃx LCS(L(u), L(v)). In other words, the length
of LCS(L(u), L(v)) indicates the depth of LCC(u, v) in the graph of cliques
induced by the construction of A(d, t). In that case, the routing is similar
as in Case (i), except that the initial (d + 2)-clique has to be replaced by
the clique LCC(u, v). Hence, the idea is to adopt the same kind of routing,
considering only neighbors which also have LCS(L(u), L(v)) as suﬃx in their
labels.

When this least common ancestor is determined, one can see, still by
construction, that the shortest route to reach this clique (either from u or
v) is to go to the neighbor which has smallest label, since the length of the
label indicates at which step the vertex was created. Indeed, the earlier the
neighbor w was created, the smaller the distance from w to the least common
clique is.

After we have reached, from u (resp.

from v), a vertex uk (resp. vk′)
that is a neighbor of the least common clique, the last thing we need to
know is whether uk and vk′ are neighbors. Thanks to Property 3, we know
that looking at L(uk) and L(vk′) is suﬃcient to answer this question. More
precisely:

• In Case (i)(b)-1, uk and vk′ share a neighbor in the initial (d + 2)-clique
(by Property 3). All those common neighbors have label l′, where l ∈ S.
Hence, if we pick any l ∈ S, then there exists and edge between uk and
l′, as well as an edge between l′ and vk′.

• In Case (i)(b)-2, uk and vk′ do not share a neighbor in the initial (d+2)-
clique. Hence, taking a route from uk (resp. vk′) to any neighbor l′
1
(resp. l′
2) belonging to the initial (d + 2)-clique, we can ﬁnally take the
edge from l′
2 (which are neighbors, since they both belong to the
initial (d + 2)-clique) in order to close the path from u to v.

1 to l′

• In Case (ii)(a), uk and vk′ share a neighbor in LCC(u, v). Hence we
can close the path by going to any vertex w with label l, l ∈ Q, since
w is a neighbor of both uk and vk′.

• In Case (ii)(b), uk and vk′ do not share a neighbor in LCC(u, v). Hence
we route from uk (resp. vk′) to any neighbor w1 (resp. w2) in LCC(u, v),

12

and we close the path by taking the edge (w1, w2). This edge exists since
both vertices w1 and w2 belong to the same clique LCC(u, v).

Hence we conclude that our labeling of vertices in A(d, t) allows a routing

between any two vertices u and v, and that it is of shortest paths.

5 Conclusion

We have proposed an expanded deterministic Apollonian network model,
which represents a transition for degree distribution between exponential
and power law distributions. Our model successfully reproduces some re-
markable characteristics in many nature and man-made networks. We have
also introduced a vertex labeling for these networks. The length of the label
is optimal. Using the vertex labels it is possible to ﬁnd in an eﬃcient way
a shortest path between any pair of vertices. Nowadays, eﬃcient handling
and delivery in communication networks (e.g. the Internet) has become one
important practical issues, and it is directly related to the problem of ﬁnding
shortest paths between any two vertices. Our results, therefore, can be useful
when describing new communication protocols for complex communication
systems.

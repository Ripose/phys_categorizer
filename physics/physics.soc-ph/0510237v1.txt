Abstract

In this study, the time dependence of the survival probability of an opinion in a closed commu-
nity has been investigated depend on social temperature with the Kawasaki-exchange dynamics
based on previous study in Ref. [8]. It is shown that the survival probability of opinion decays
with stretched exponential law consistent with previous static model. However, the crossover
regime in the decay of the survival probability has been observed in this dynamic model unlike
previous model. The decay characteristic of both two regimes obey to stretched exponential.

Introduction

Binary models like Ising-type simulation have a long history. They have been applied by
Schelling to describe the ghetto formation in the inner cities of the USA, i.e., to study phase
separation between black and white [1].
In the sociophysics context, recently, many social
phenomena such as election, propagation of information, predicting features of traﬃc, migration,
opinion dynamics and formation in a social group have been successful modelled based on Ising
spin systems using models and tools of statistical physics. With this respect, particularly
successful models have been developed by Sznajd [2], Deﬀuant et al.[3] and Hegselmann and
Krause [4].

Among those three models, the one developed by Sznajd is the most appropriate for sim-
ulation in networks and lattices, because it consider just the interactions between the nearest
neighbors. Indeed, the Sznajd model has been successfully applied to model sociophysical and
economic systems [5]. On the other hand, several modiﬁcations of the Sznajd model have been
studied using diﬀerent rules or topologies starting from diﬀerent initial opinion densities [5, 6, 7].
All these models are static not dynamic and they allow for consensus (one ﬁnal opinion), po-
larization (two ﬁnal opinion), and fragmentation (more than two ﬁnal opinions), depending on
how tolerant people are to diﬀerent opinions.

More recently the a striking sociophysical model has been suggested by Aydiner [8] in
order to explain the time evolution of resistance probability of a closed community in a one-
dimensional Sznajd like model based on Ising spin system. Aydiner shown that resistance

does not move on the lattice sites during the simulation, so this model was so-called static.
However, in a realistic case, spins i.e., people move in the community i.e., in the space. Social
or opinion formation formed depend upon dynamics of system. Because, there must be a
direct connection between opinion dynamics and formation in a social system since the social
formation is determined by the dynamics. Meyer-Ortmanns studied recent work in which the
condition for ghetto formation in a population with natives and immigrants by using Kawasaki-
exchange dynamics in a two dimensional Ising model [9]. She showed that ghetto formation can
be avoided with a temperature increasing with time. Similarly, Schulze have also generalized
Meyer-Ortmanns work to up to seven diﬀerent ethnic groups to explain ghetto formation in a
multi-cultural societies in a Potts-like model [10].

In this study, combining the Aydiner and Meyer-Ortmanns models we have developed a

dynamic version of the Aydiner model based on one-dimensional Ising model.

2 Kinetic Model and Simulation

In his one-dimensional static model, each site carrier a spin which is either spin up (+1) or
spin down (-1) randomly. Spin up (+1) represent the host people and spin down (-1) represent
the soldier. The host people always against occupation, and, on the other hand, soldier always
willing to continue occupation, who always have the opinion opposite of that of the host people.
Furthermore, the community member i.e., spins doesn’t also move on the lattice during the
process.

In his model, initially, it assumed that there is a over all consensus among member of the
community against occupation even if some exceptions exist. One expects that host people
obey to this consensus at least initially. In this sense, community behaves as polarized at zero
social temperature [13] against occupation just like Ising ferromagnet at zero temperature.

It was conjectured that host people are inﬂuenced by soldiers even though they against
occupation owing to they are exposed to intensive biased information or propagation. Soldiers

aﬀect the host people and force to change their opinion about occupation. Eﬀected people may
change their own opinions depending on resistance probability of the nearest neighbors about
occupation. Moreover, eﬀected host people aﬀect neighbors. Such a mechanism depolarize the
polarization (resistance probability) of all host people. Hence social polarization destroy.

However, soldiers, unlike host people, have not been inﬂuenced by the host people. Their
opinion about justifying the occupation does not change during the occupation process, since
they may be stubborn, stable or professional etc., who behaves like persistent spins in Ising
spin system. It is means that the probability of the against occupation of a soldier is always
zero.

If we summarize, we can say that none spins does ﬂip fully in the system. Spin up always
remains spin up, and spin down always remains spin down. In this respect, the probability of
against occupation of host people can be interpreted as a survival probability of opinion of host
people about occupation under above considerations. In this sense, the survival probability
Wi of opinion of host people indicate equal to 1 at least initially and, on the other hand, the
probability of against occupation of soldier equal to zero, which means that soldier behaves as
a trap point lattice which depolarize the survival probability of opinion of host people.

Of course, one may suggest that there are many diﬀerent number of opinions in society,
however, it is possible to ﬁnd that a society being formed two-state opinion in a real case.
Therefore this model is a good example for two-state opinion model as well Galam contrarian
model [14] even though it seems that it is very simple. Furthermore, in real social systems,
people move on the space, i.e., lattice. Therefore, in this study, we assumed that people
i.e., spins randomly move on the lattice through the Kawasaki-exchange dynamics contrary to
previous model.

The survival probability Wi for a people at site i at the next time t + 1 is determined with

the survival probability of nearest-neighbors with previous time t as

Wi(t + 1) =

[(Wi+1(t) + Wi−1(t)].

For all site the survival probability are calculated as synchronizely.

Randomly motion of the spins i.e., people on the lattice through the Kawasaki-exchange
dynamics. Firstly, a spin pair is chosen randomly and then it is decided whether spin pair
exchange with each other or not. In this approach, the nearest-neighbor spins are exchanged
under heat-bath dynamics, i.e., with probability p ∼ exp (−∆E/kBT )), where ∆E is the energy
change under the spin exchange, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature i.e.,
social temperature or tolerance. Hence, to obtain probability p we need to calculate E1 and E2
which correspond to energy of the spin pair at ﬁrst position and after exchange with position
of spins, respectively. Energy E1 and E2 can be calculated in terms of the survival probability
instead of spin value as

Energy diﬀerence from Eqs. 1(a) and (b) is deﬁned as ∆E = E2 − E1.

E1(t) = aWi(t) + bWi+1(t)

E2(t) = aWi+1(t) + bWi(t)

a = [Wi−1(t) + Wi+1(t)]

b = [Wi(t) + Wi+2(t)].

3 Results and Discussion

We have adopted the Monte Carlo simulation technique to the one-dimensional sociophysical
model using the lattice size L = 1000 with periodic boundary condition, and independent
conﬁguration R = 1000 for the averaged results. The simple algorithm for the simulation is
as follows: i) at the t = 0, Eq. (4) is initially calculated, ii) for t > 0 a spin pair is randomly
chosen, and then it is decided whether the spin pair exchange or not with the probability
p ∼ exp (−∆E/kBT )), this step is repeated L times, iii) after ii-steps are completed, Eq. (4) is
recalculated, and to continue this procedure goes to step ii.

The simulation results are as follow: It is explicitly seen from Figs. 1(a)-(c) that there are
no power, exponential and logarithmic law dependence in our simulation data, respectively.

Fig. 2: The time dependence of the survival probability of the opinion of host people decays
KWW i.e., stretched exponential with time for diﬀerent social temperature T . It seems that
the time crossover appears in the time evolution of survival probability of the opinion. The
crossover become more clear with decreasing social temperature T .

However, as seen Fig. 1(d), data well ﬁt to the stretched exponential function as

< P (t) >∼ e

−λtβ

where λ is the relaxation constant, and β is the decay exponent of the survival probability.
This result indicate that the time evaluation of survival probability of the opinion of the host
people in a closed community has Kohlraush-William-Watts (KWW) [11, 12] i.e., stretched
exponential character.

This result consistent with static model [8]. But, unlike the static model, time crossover has
been observed in dynamic model. In order to investigate the transition we have plotted survival
probability versus time for diﬀerent social temperature T in Fig. 2. It is clearly seen that the
time crossover occurs depend on social temperature. When social temperature decreasing the
crossover become more clear. Such a behavior was not observed in a static model. We can
bridge the short time regime and the long time regime by a scaling function f (t/tc)

For our simulation data, the scaling relation (6) can be written for very large and very small
times as

hP (t)i = e

−(t/τ )β

f (t/tc) .

hP (t)i ∼ n

e−(t/τ )β1
e−(t/τ )β2

if t << tc
if t >> tc.

On the other hand, in order see how the decay exponent β depend on social temperature T ,
and soldier density ρ, we have plotted β versus social temperature T in Fig. 3 for a ﬁxed value
of density ρ, and soldier density ρ in Fig. 4 for t < tc and t > tc in account to taken diﬀerent
social temperature T , respectively.

As seen from Fig. 3, the decay exponent has two diﬀerent character for t < tc and t >
tc depend on social temperature T . While the decay exponent β1 decreases with increasing
temperature T for t < tc, whereas β2 increases with increasing temperature T for t > tc at low
temperatures. However, for relatively high temperatures we roughly say that β1 approach to
β2 for both two regimes. On the other hand, it seems from Fig. 4 that β1 and β2 are linearly
depend on soldier density both of two regimes at low social temperature.

Finally, to understand the social temperature and soldier density dependence of the time
crossover tc we have plotted tc versus social temperature T in Fig. 5 for a ﬁxed soldier density
ρ, and soldier density in Fig. 6 for ﬁxed social temperature T , respectively. It seems from Fig.
5 that the crossover transition tc quite rapidly decrease with increasing T , on the other hand,
it seems from Fig. 6 that it slowly decrease with increasing soldier density ρ. We note that as
seen inserted ﬁgure in Fig. 6 the crossover transition tc depends on soldier density with power
law for ﬁxed social temperature.

4 Conclusions

We suggest that the stretched exponential behavior of decay must be originated from model
system. The persistent spins i.e., the soldiers doesn’t ﬂip during simulation, therefore they
behave as a trap in the system. Hence they play a role diminishing the survival probability
of the neighbor spins in the system. Consequently, decay characteristic of the system can be
explain due to the trapping states. Another say, this characteristic behavior doesn’t depend on
either diﬀusion dynamics of spins or interaction rules between spins.

Another unexpected behavior is the time crossover in β contrast to previous model [8]. We
supposed that this amazing result originated from opinion dynamics depend on social temper-
ature. Model allows to the opinion formation with time. Indeed, there is a direct connection
between opinion dynamics and formation in a social system since the social formation is de-
termined by the dynamics as depend on the social temperature. For example, in a real spin
system, decreasing temperature phase separation may occur in the system. In the sociophysical
sense, it means that people who have diﬀerent opinion are separated each other with decreasing
social tolerance, and therefore the ghetto formation or polarization may occur in the system.

It is expected that interactions between soldier and host people is maximum when soldiers
are randomly distributed in the community. As social temperature, i.e., tolerance is decreased,
however, phase separation occur with time, so this leads to decreasing of the interactions.

In our opinion, the ghetto formation in the system doesn’t leads crossover transition in
time because of the ghetto formation is randomly distributed relatively. On the other hand,
the time average of survival probability over diﬀerent conﬁguration eﬀect of ghetto formation
may probably destroy. So we doesn’t hope that ghetto formation is not responsible crossover
transition. However, polarization must be occurred at low temperature leads to meaningful
phase separation in the system. Such a polarization may leads to crossover transition in time.
Stretched exponential behavior indicates mathematically that decay for the relatively short
times is fast, but for relatively long times it is slower. One can observe that this mathemat-
ical behavior corresponds to occupation processes in the real world. In generally, a military
occupation is realized after a hot war. The community does not react to occupation since it
occurs as a result of defeat. People are aﬀected easily by propaganda or other similar ways.
Therefore, it is no surprise that resistance probability decrease rapidly at relatively short times.
On the other hand, spontaneous reaction may begin against occupation in the community after
the shock. Hence, community begins by regaining consciousness and more organized resistance
may display diﬃculties for occupants. For long times, the resistance probability decreases more
slowly. This means that resistance against occupation extends to long times in practice. At
this point, the number of soldiers is also important, because the density of soldiers determines
the speed of decaying.

The diﬀerent regimes have been observed in the decay of the survival probability. These
regimes clearly appear particularly at low temperatures. In the case of the social temperature is
very low, β1 is bigger than β2 which indicates the decay of the survival probability for relatively
short time is slower than for relatively long time. This can be interpreted that the resistance of

8

host people against occupation may be broken spontaneously if soldier can wait enough time.
Of course, the mechanism considered in this work can be regarded as simple, but, it would be
useful to understand the time evolution of the resistance probability of the community against
to occupation in the one-dimensional model under some considerations. We remember that
simple social rules lead to complicated social results, hence we believe that the obtained results
and model can be applied the real social phenomena in the societies to understand the basis of
them.

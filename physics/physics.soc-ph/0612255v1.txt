Abstract

The eﬀect of the position of on-ramp and oﬀ-ramp i1 and i2, respectively, on the
one dimensional-cellular automaton traﬃc ﬂow behaviour, is investigated numerically.
The injection rates at i1 and i2 are α0 and β0, respectively. However, in the open
boundary conditions, with injecting and extracting rates α and β and using parallel
dynamics, several phases occur; namely, low density phase (LDP), intermediate density
phase (IDP), plateau current phase (PCP) and high density phase (HDP). It is found
that phase diagrams exhibit diﬀerent kind of topologies. For intermediate value of ex-
tracting rates β0 and β and low value of α, (i1, α0) phase diagram provides LDP-IDP,
LDP-PCP, IDP-PCP, and PCP-HDP transitions, and critical end points. The oﬀ-ramp
position is located to the middle of the road. By increasing β0 and β, the IDP desap-
pears. For high value of β, only LDP-HDP persists.

1 Introduction

During the last years, the ﬁeld of transport have attracted several researchers [ ]. This
interest is due primarily to the fact that transportation problems are related to the
global behaviour of systems with many elements interacting at short distances, such as
the vehicles traveling on the streets, or informations which travel over the internet net-
work. In particular, the investigation of open traﬃc systems with on- and oﬀ-ramps is
quite popular at the moment [ ]. One reason for this is the impact of the understanding
of varying the diﬀerent ﬂow ratesin order to optimize the total ﬂow or trip times.

Among the diﬀerent methods of investigation and simulation of highway traﬃc, as-
symetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) is the most promesing [ ]. Indeed, ASEP is
the simplest driven diﬀusive system where particles on a one-dimensional lattice hop
with asymetric rates under excluded volume constraints.

The question we want to answer is the following: let us suppose we have a highway
running in an urban conglomeration and that there are an access from urban conglom-
eration to the highway and an exit from the highway. We want to understand where
the access and the exit positions must be located in order to maximize the ﬂux of cars
in the road. Our aim in this paper is to study the eﬀect of the on-ramp and oﬀ-ramp
positions on the one dimensional-cellular automaton traﬃc ﬂow behaviour in the open
boundaries case. Depending on the injecting and extracting rate values, an adequate
localization of the on- and oﬀ-ramp positions leads to the appearance of new phases
and topologies. Moreover, to compare our results to those where only one oﬀ-ramp was
taken into account [30], quantitative diﬀerences can be understood from the behaviour
of average density, current and phase diagrams for diﬀerent parameters.

The paper is organised as follows: Model and method are given in section 2; section

3 is reserved to results and discussion; the conclusion is presented in section 4.

2 Model

We consider a one-dimensional lattice of length L. Each lattice site is either empty or
occupied by one particle. Hence the state of the system is deﬁned by a set of occupation
numbers τ1,τ2,...,τL, while τi = 1 (τi = 0) means that the site i is occupied (empty). We
suppose that the main road is single lane, an on-ramp and an oﬀ-ramp connect the main
road only on single lattice i1 for entry and on single lattice i2 for way out. During each
time interval ∆t, each particle jump to the empty adjacent site on its right and does not
move otherwise (i 6= i2). ∆t is an interesting parameter that enables the possibility to
interpolate between the cases of fully parallel (∆t = 1) and random sequential (∆t → 0)
updates [29]. Particles are injected, by a rate α∆t, in the ﬁrst site being to the left
side of the road if this site is empty, and particles enter in the road by site i1, with a
probability α0∆t without constraint, if this site is empty. While, the particle being in
the last site on the right can leave the road with a rate β∆t and particles removed on
the way out with a rate βo∆t. At site i1 (i2) the occupation (absorption) priority is
given to the particle which enter in the road (particle leaving the road). Hence the cars,
which are added to the road, avoid any collision.
In our numerical calculations, the rule described above is updated in parallel, ∆t = 1,
i.e. during one update step the new particle position do not inﬂuence the rest and only
the previous positions have to be taken into account. During each of the time steps,
each particle moves one site unless the adjacent site on its right is occupied by another
particle. The advantage of parallel update, with respect to sublattice or sequential
update is that all sites are equivalent, which should be the case in realistic model with
translational invariance.
In order to compute the average of any parameter w (< w >), the values of w(t) obtained
from 5 × 104 to 105 time steps are averaged. Starting the simulations from random
conﬁgurations, the system reaches a stationary state after a suﬃciently large number
of time steps. In all our simulations, we averaged over 60 − 100 initial conﬁgurations.
For the update step, we consider two sub steps as shown in ﬁgure 1:
In the ﬁrst sub step, the sites i1 and i2 are updated and in the second half, the chain
updates. Thus if the system has the conﬁguration τ1(t), τ2(t),...,τL(t) at time t it will
change at time t + ∆t to the following:

3 Results and Discussion

As we have mentioned previously, our aim in this paper is to study the eﬀect of the
positions of the on- and oﬀ-ramps i1 and i2, respectively, for diﬀerent values of α, β0 and
β, on the average density and ﬂux in chain. The study is made in the open boundary
conditions case. α0 and α denote the injecting rates at ﬁrst site (i = 1) and at site i1,
respectively. β0 and β are the extracting rates at site i2 and at the last one (i = L),
respectively. The length of the road studied here is L=1000.
The ﬁgures 2(a) and 2(b) give respectively the variation of the average density ρ and
average current J versus the injecting rate α0 for several values of the on-ramp position
i1. These ﬁgures are given for α = 0.1, β = 0.1 and β0 = 0.4. However, when the
on-ramp is located upstream of the oﬀ-ramp, the system studied exhibits four phases,
depending of the behaviours of the density, ρ, and the current, J. Namely: i) The low
density phase (LDP), where the averages density and current increase when increasing
the rate of injected particles α0. ii) The intermediate density phase (IDP) characterised
by a smoothly increase of the density and average current.
iii) The plateau current
phase (PCP) for which the density and current are constant in a special interval of
α0. iv) The high density phase (HDP) in which, for high values of α0, the current de-
creases and the density reaches its maximum value and remains constant. On the other
hand, when i1 is located downstream from i2, the IDP desappears. In addition, when
increansing i1 for a given value of α0, the ﬁgure 2(a) shows that the average density
is constant in LDP, increases in IDP and PCP then decreases in HDP. The ﬁgure 2(a)
exhibits an inversion point situated at the PCP-HDP transition. Moreover, the ﬁgure
2(b) shows that the average current deceases by increasing i1, for any value of α0.
For i1 < i2, we note that the IDP, which doesn’t appear in the model where only the
oﬀ-ramp is taken into account [30], occurs for the intermediate values of α0 (α0c1 <
α0 < α0c2). α0c1 and α0c2 correspond to the transition between LDP-IDP and IDP-
PCP, respectively. While the PCP arises between two critical values α0c2 and α0c3 of
injecting rate α0. Where α0c3 corresponds to the PCP-HDP transition. Note that the
transitions which occur at α0c3 disappears when i1 is located after i2 (Figure 2a). Now,
in order to have a suitable criterion for determination of the nature of the transition,
we identify the ﬁrst order transition (abrupt transition) by the jump in the average
density or by the existence of a peak in the derivative of ρ(α0) with respect to α0. The
jump in density corresponds to a ﬁrst order transition [29]. This means that the above
transitions are of ﬁrst order type.
Collecting the results illustrated in ﬁgures 2(a) and 2(b), the four regions are given
on the phase diagram (i1,α0) shown in Figure 2(c). Beside this, such phase diagram
exhibits four critial end points, around which there is no distnction between the phases.
This critical end points are indicated by CEP .

5

For low values of α, β and β0 (α = 0.1, β = 0.1 and β0 = 0.1), The (i1, α0) phase dia-
gram is presented in ﬁgure 3. This ﬁgure exhibits only tow ﬁrst order phase transitions.
Namely, LDP-PCP, PCP-HDP transitions. The later one can be founed by variying
α0,for a given value of i1 lower than i2, or at i1 = i2, for 0.45 < α0 < 0.95. Moreover,
the ﬁgure 3 exhibits two critical end points. The comparison of ﬁgures 2 and 3 highlight
the eﬀect of β0 on the (i1, α0) phase diagram. Indeed, for intermediate value of β0, the
IDP arises.
For a suﬃciently large value of β0, the critical end points desapears, as shown in ﬁgure
4. This ﬁgure is given for α = 0.1, β = 0.1 and β0 = 0.8.
The ﬁgure 5 give the (i1, α0) phase diagram for α = 0.1, β0 = 0.1 and β = 0.3.
In
this case, the system exhibits four phases and three critical end points. From ﬁgures 2c
and 5, we deduce that the IDP arises for intemediate values of extracting rates β or β0,
when i1 is upstream of 2.

4 Conclusion

Using numerical simulations, we have studied the eﬀect of the on- and oﬀ-ramp posi-
tions on the traﬃc ﬂow behaviour of a one dimensional-cellular automaton, with parallel
update. Depending on the values of α, β and β0, the (i1, α0) phase diagram exhibits
diﬀerent topologies. The IDP occurs only at special positions of on- and oﬀ-ramps with
special values of extracting rates β and β0 and injecting rates α and α0. The transition
between diﬀerent phases are of ﬁrst order. Furthermore, the system exhibits critical
end points in the (i1, α0) plane in the case of moderate values of β and β0 and small
value of α.

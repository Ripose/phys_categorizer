In this paper, we present a method to project co-authorship networks, that accounts in detail for
the geometrical structure of scientists collaborations. By restricting the scope to 3-body interactions,
we focus on the number of triangles in the system, and show the importance of multi-scientists (more
than 2) collaborations in the social network. This motivates the introduction of generalized networks,
where basic connections are not binary, but involve arbitrary number of components. We focus on
the 3-body case, and study numerically the percolation transition.

INTRODUCTION

It is well-known in statistical physics that N-body cor-
relations have to be carefully described in order to char-
acterize statistical properties of complex systems. For in-
stance, in the case of the Liouville equation for Hamilto-
nian dynamics, this problem is at the heart of the deriva-
tion of the reduced BBGKY hierarchy, thereby leading
to the Boltzmann and Enskog theories for ﬂuids [1]. In
this line of though, it is primordial to discriminate N-
body correlations that are due to intrinsic N-body in-
teractions, from those that merely develop from lower
order interactions. This issue is directly related to a well-
known problem in complex network theory, i.e. the ”pro-
jection” of bipartite networks onto simpliﬁed structures.
As a paradigm for such systems, people usually consider
co-authorship networks [2], namely networks composed
by two kinds of nodes, e.g. the scientists and the arti-
cles, with links running between scientists and the papers
they wrote. In that case, the usual projection method [3]
consists in focusing e.g. on the scientist nodes, and in
drawing a link between them if they co-authored a com-
mon paper (see Fig.1). As a result, the projected system
is a unipartite network of scientists, that characterizes
the community structure of science collaborations. Such
studies have been very active recently, due to their com-

unipartite scientists graph.

plex social structure [4], to the ubiquity of such bipartite
networks in complex systems [9] [10], and to the large
databases available.

A standard quantity of interest in order to character-
ize the structure of the projected network is the clus-
tering coeﬃcient [11], which measures network ”transi-
tivity”, namely the probability that two scientist’s co-
authors have themselves coauthored a paper.
In topo-
logical terms, it is a measure of the density of triangles
in a network, a triangle being formed every time two of
one’s collaborators collaborate with each other. This co-
eﬃcient is usually very high in systems where sociological
cliques develop [8]. However, part of the clustering in co-
authorship network is due to papers with three or more
coauthors. Such papers introduce trivial triangles of col-
laborating authors, thereby increasing the clustering co-
eﬃcient. This problem, that was raised by Newman et al.
[3], was circumvented by studying directly the bipartite
network, in order to infer the authors community struc-
ture. Newman et al. showed on some examples that these
high order interactions may account for one half of the
clustering coeﬃcient. One should note, however, that if
this approach oﬀers a well-deﬁned theoretical framework
for bipartite networks, it suﬀers a lack of transparency as
compared to the original projection method, i.e. it does
not allow a clear visualisation of the unipartite structure.
In this article, we propose an alternative approach that
is based on a more reﬁne unipartite projection, and fol-
lows Statistical Mechanics usual expansion methods. To
do so, we focus on a small dataset, retrieved from the
arXiv database and composed of articles dedicated to
complex network theory. This choice is motivated by
their relatively few co-authors per article, a property
typical to theoretical physics papers [12]. Our method
consists in discriminating the diﬀerent kinds of scientists
collaborations, based upon the number of co-authors per
article. This discrimination leads to a diagram repre-
sentation [5, 7] of co-authorship (see also [6] for the ap-
plicability of Feynman diagrams in complex networks).
The resulting N-body projection reconciles the visual fea-
tures of the usual projection, and the exact description of
Newman’s theoretical approach. Empirical results con-
ﬁrm the importance of high order collaborations in the
network structure. Therefore, we introduce in the last

are negligible. In that sole case, we attributed the papers
of H. Jeong to the most proliﬁc author (Hawoong Jeong
in the dataset). Given this identiﬁcation method, we ﬁnd
nP = 2533 persons and nA = 1611 articles. The distribu-
tion of the number of co-authors per article (Fig.2) shows
clearly a rapid exponential decrease, associated to a clear
predominance of small collaborations, as expected.

Formally, the bipartite structure authors-papers may
be mapped exactly on the vector of matrices M deﬁned
by:

M = [M(1), M(2), ..., M(j), ...., M(nP )]

(1)

where M(j) is a square nj
P matrix that accounts for all
articles co-authored by j scientists. By deﬁnition, the
element M (j)
a1...aj are equal to the number of collabora-
tions between the j authors a1...aj.
In the following,
we assume that co-authorship is not a directed relation,
thereby neglecting the position of the authors in the col-
laboration, e.g. whether or not the author is the ﬁrst
author. This implies that the matrices are symmetric
under permutations of indices. Moreover, as people can
not collaborate with themselves, the diagonal elements
M (j)
aa...a vanish by construction. For example, M (1)
a1 and
M (2)
a1a2 represent respectively the total number of papers
written by a1 alone, and the total number of papers writ-
ten by the pair (a1, a2).

A way to visualize M consists in a network whose
nodes are the scientists, and whose links are discrimi-
nated by their shape. The intrinsic co-authorship inter-
actions form loops (order 1), lines (order 2), triangles
(order 3) (see Fig.3)... To represent the intensity of the
multiplet interaction, the width of the lines is taken to
be proportional to the number of collaborations of this
multiplet. Altogether, these rules lead to a graphical rep-
resentation of M, that is much more reﬁne than the usual
projection method (Fig.4).

It is important to point out that the vector of ma-
trices M describes without approximation the bipartite

II. N-BODY PROJECTION METHOD

The data set contains all articles from arXiv in the time
interval [1995 : 2005], that contain the word ”network” in
their abstract and are classiﬁed as ”cond-mat”. In order
to discriminate the authors and avoid spurious data, we
checkeed the names and the ﬁrst names of the authors.
Moreover, in order to avoid multiple ways for an author
to cosign a paper, we also took into account the initial
notation of the prenames. For instance, Marcel Ausloos
and M. Ausloos are the same person, while Marcel Aus-
loos and Mike Ausloos are considered to be diﬀerent. Let
us stress that this method may lead to ambiguities if an
initial refers to two diﬀerent ﬁrst names, e.g. M. Ausloos
might be Marcel or Mike Ausloos. Nonetheless, we have
veriﬁed that this case occurs only once in the data set
(Hawoong, Hyeong-Chai and H. Jeong), so that its eﬀects

mann)); 1 four-authors collaboration (Timme, Wolf, Geisel,

laborates three times, its links are three times larger than the
other links.

network, and that it reminds the Liouville distribution
in phase space of a Hamiltonian system. Accordingly, a
relevant macroscopic description of the system relies on
a coarse-grained reduction of its internal variables. The
simplest reduced matrix is the one-scientist matrix R(1)
that is obtained by summing over the N-body connec-
tions, N ≥ 2:

Its elements represent the total number of articles written
by the pair of scientists (a1, a2). Remarkably, this ma-
trix reproduces the usual projection method (Fig. 1), and
obviously simpliﬁes the structure of the bipartite struc-
ture by hiding the eﬀect of high order connections. The

This new matrix counts the number of papers co-written

by the triplet (a1, a2, a3), and may be represented by
a network whose links are triangles relating three au-
thors. The generalization to higher order matrices R(j)
is straightforward, but, as in the case of the BBGKY hi-
erarchy, a truncature of the vector M must be ﬁxed at
some level in order to describe usefully and compactly
the system. It is therefore important to point that the
knowledge of M(2) together with R(3) is completely suf-
ﬁcient in order to characterize the triangular structure of
M. Consequently, in this paper, we stop the reduction
procedure at the 3-body level, and deﬁne the triangular
projection of M by the application:

[M (1)

a1 , M (2)

a1a2, M (3)
→ [M (1)

The triangular projection is depicted in Fig. 5, and com-
pared to the usual projection method. In order to test
the relevance of this description, we have measured in the
data set the total number of triangles generated by edges.
We discriminate two kinds of triangles: those which arise
from one 3-body interaction of R(3), and those which
arise only from an interplay of diﬀerent interactions.
There are respectively 5550 and 30 such triangles, namely
99.5% of triangles are of the ﬁrst kind. This observation
by itself therefore justiﬁes the detailed projection method
introduced in this section, and shows the importance of
co-authorship links geometry in the characterization of
network structures, precisely the clustering coeﬃcient in
the present case.

III. TRIANGULAR ERD ¨OS-RENYI
NETWORKS

FIG. 6: Percolation transition in the ERN3 model with 50
nodes, from a dilute phase with small disconnected islands
(8 triangles) to a percolated phase with one giant cluster (20
triangles).

The empirical results of the previous section have
shown the signiﬁcance of N-body connections in social
networks. A more complete framework for networks is
therefore required in order to describe correctly the sys-
tem complexity.
In this article, we focus on the most
simple generalization, namely a network whose links re-
late triplets of nodes. To so, we base our modeling on
the Erd¨os-Renyi uncorrelated random graph [13], i.e. the
usual prototype to be compared with more complex ran-
dom graphs. The usual Erd¨os-Renyi network (ERN) is
composed by Nn labeled nodes connected by N (2)
edges,
which are chosen randomly from the Nn(Nn − 1)/2 pos-
sible edges. In this paper, we deﬁne the triangular ER
network (ERN3) to be composed by Nn labeled nodes,
connected by N (3)
triangles, which are chosen randomly
from the Nn(Nn − 1)(Nn − 2)/6 possible triangles. As a
result, connections in the system relate triplets of nodes
(a1, a2, a3), and the matrix vector M reduces to the ma-
trix M(3). Before going further, let us point that the
clustering coeﬃcient of triangular ER networks is very
high by construction, but, contrary to intuition, it is dif-
ferent from 1 in general. For instance, for the two triplets

e

e

(a1, a2, a3) and (a1, a4, a5), the local clustering coeﬃcient
of a1 is equal to 1
3 .

In this paper, we focus numerically on the percola-
tion transition [14] in ERN3, i.e. on the appearance of
a giant component by increasing the number of nodes in
the system (Fig.6). This transition is usually associated
to dramatic changes in the topological structure, that
are crucial to ensure communicability between network
nodes, e.g. the spreading of scientiﬁc knowledge in the
case under study. In the following, we work at ﬁxed num-
ber of nodes, and focus on the proportion of nodes in the
main cluster as a function of the number of binary links
in the system. Moreover, in order to compare results with
the usual ERN, we do not count twice redundant links,
i.e. couples of authors who interact in diﬀerent triplets.
For instance, the triplet (a1, a2, a3) accounts for 3 binary
links, but (a1, a2, a3) and (a1, a2, a4) account together for
5 links, so that N (3)
in general. Whatever, this
detailed counting has small eﬀects on the location of the
percolation transition. Numerical results are depicted in
ﬁgure 7, where we consider networks with Nn = 1000.
Obviously, the triangular structure of interactions dis-

restrains the network exploration as compared to random
structures. Indeed, 3 links relate only 3 nodes in ERN3,
while 3 links typically relate 4 nodes in ERN. Finally, let
us stress that the same mechanism takes place in systems
with high clustering coeﬃcients [15, 16].

IV. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we show the importance of N-body inter-
actions in co-authorships networks. By focusing on data
sets extracted from the arXiv database, we introduce a
way to project bipartite networks onto unipartite net-
works. This approach generalizes usual projection meth-
ods by accounting for the complex geometrical ﬁgures
connecting authors. To do so, we present a simple the-
oretical framework, and deﬁne N-body reduced and pro-
jected networks. The graphical representation of these
simpliﬁed networks rests on a ”shape-based” discrimi-
nation of the diﬀerent co-authorship interactions (for a
”color-based” version, see the author’s website [17]), and
allows a clear visualization of the diﬀerent mechanisms
occurring in the system. Finally, we apply the method to
some arXiv data subset, thereby showing the importance
of such ”high order corrections” in order to characterize
the community structure of scientists. The empirical re-
sults motivate therefore a better study of networks with
complex weighted geometrical links. In the last section,
we focus on the simplest case by introducing a triangular
random model, ERN3. Moreover, we restrict the scope
by analyzing the eﬀect of the 3-body connection on per-
colation. A complete study of the topological of ERN3
as well as its generalization to higher order connections
is let for a forthcoming work.

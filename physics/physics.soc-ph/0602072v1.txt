Abstract

In this paper, we propose a simple rule that generates scale-free small-world net-
works with tunable assortative coeﬃcient. These networks are constructed by two-
stage adding process for each new node. The model can reproduce scale-free degree
distributions and small-world eﬀect. The simulation results are consistent with the
theoretical predictions approximately. Interestingly, we obtain the nontrivial clus-
tering coeﬃcient C and tunable degree assortativity r by adjusting the parameter:
the preferential exponent β. The model can unify the characterization of both as-
sortative and disassortative networks.

Key words: Complex networks, Scale-free networks, Small-world networks,
Assortative coeﬃcient.

the World-Wide Web, the social networks, the scientiﬁc collaboration and so
on [1,2,3,4,5,6]. Recent works on the complex networks have been driven by the
empirical properties of real-world networks and the studies on network dynam-
ics [7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29]. Many em-
pirical evidences indicate that the networks in various ﬁelds have some com-
mon topology characteristics. They have a small average distance like random
graphs, a large clustering coeﬃcient and power-law degree distribution [1,2],
which are called the small-world and scale-free characteristics. The other char-
acteristic is that the social networks are assortative while almost all biological
and technological networks are opposite. The networks with high clustering
and small average distance are the small-world model of Watts and Strogatz
(WS)[1], while the networks with power-law degree distribution are the scale-
free network model of Barab´asi and Albert (BA) [2]. The BA model is a pio-
neering work in the studies on networks, which suggests that the growth and
preferential attachment are two main self-organization mechanisms. Although
BA model can generate the power-law degree distributions, its assortative co-
eﬃcient r equals to zero in the limit of large size thus fail to reproduce the
disassortative property that extensively exists in the real-world networks. Re-
cently, some models that can generate either assortative or disassortative net-
works have been reported [30,31,32,33,34,35]. Wang et al. presented a mutual
attraction model for both assortative and disassortative weighted networks.
The model found that the initial attraction A of the newly added nodes may
contribute to the diﬀerence of the assortative and disassortative networks [34].
Liu et al. [36] proposed a self-learning mutual selection model for weighted
networks, which demonstrated that the self-learning probability p may be the
reason why the social networks are assortative and the technological networks
are disassortative. However, one should not expect the existence of a omnipo-
tent model that can completely illuminate the underlying mechanisms for the
emergence of disassortative property in various network systems. In this pa-
per, beside the previous studies, we exhibit an alternative model that can
generate scale-free small-world networks with tunable assortative coeﬃcient,
which may shed some light in ﬁnding the possible explanations to the diﬀerent
evolution mechanisms between assortative and disassortative networks.

Dorogovtsev et. al [37] proposed a simple model of scale-free growing net-
works . In this model, a new node is added to the network at each time step,
which connects to both ends of a randomly chosen link undirected. The model
can be equally described by the process that the newly added node connect
to node i preferentially, then select a neighbor node of the node i randomly.
Holme and Kim [38] proposed a model to generate growing scale-free networks
with tunable clustering. The model introduced an additional step to get the
trial information and demonstrated that the average number of trial informa-
tion controls the clustering coeﬃcient of the network. It should be noticed
that the newly added node connect to the ﬁrst node i preferentially, while
connect to the neighbor node of the ﬁrst node i randomly. In this paper, we

2

will propose a growing scale-free network model with tunable assortative co-
eﬃcient. Inspired by the above two models, the new node is added into the
network by two steps. In the ﬁrst step, the newly added node connects to the
existing nodes i preferentially. In the second step, this node selects a neighbor
node s of the node i with probability kβ
j , where β is the parameter
s /
named preferential exponent and Γi is the neighbor node set of node i. This
model will be equal to the Holme-Kim model[37] when β = 0, and the MRGN
model[35] when β = 1 Speciﬁcally, the model can generate a nontrivial clus-
tering property and tunable assortativity coeﬃcient. Therefore, one may ﬁnd
explanations to various real-world networks by our microscopic mechanisms.

2 Construction of the Model

Our model is deﬁned as following.

(1) Initial condition: The model starts with m0 connected nodes.

(2) Growth: At each time step, one new node v with m edges is added at

every time step. Time t is identiﬁed as the number of time steps.

(3) The ﬁrst step: Each edge of v is then attached to an existing node with
the probability proportional to its degree, i.e., the probability for a node i
to be attached to v is

(4) The second step: If an edge between v and w was added in the ﬁrst step,
then add one more edge from v to a randomly chosen neighbor s of w with
probability Pt according to the following probability

Πi =

ki
Pj kj

.

If there remains no pair to connect, i.e., if all neighbors of w were always
connected to v, do the ﬁrst step instead.

3 Characteristics of the Model

3.1 Degree distribution

The degree distribution is one of the most important statistical character-
istics of networks. Since some real-world networks are scale-free, whether the
network is of the power-law degree distribution is a criterion to judge the va-
lidity of the model. By adopting the mean-ﬁeld theory, the degree evolution
of individual node can be described as

∂ki
∂t

= P (i) + X
j∈Γi

P (i|j)P (j),

where P (i) denotes the probability that the node i with degree ki is selected
at the ﬁrst step, P (i|j) denotes the conditional probability that node i is a
neighbor of node j with degree kj which has been selected at the ﬁrst step.

According to the preferential attachment mechanism of the ﬁrst step, one

The conditional probability P (i|j) can be calculated by

has

P (i) =

P (i|j) =

Then we can get that P (k) ∼ k−3, which has been proved by Holme and Kim
[38]. If β = 1, the following formula can be obtained under the assumption

We can obtain that the degree distribution p(k) ∼ k−r obeys the power-law
and the exponent γ = 3. The numerical results are demonstrated in Fig.
1. From Fig. 1, we can get that the exponents γ of the degree distribution
are around -3 when β = −2, −1, 0, 1, 2. When β > 0, the exponent γ would
increase slightly as the β increases.

nodes when m = 3 and Pt = 0.3. In this ﬁgure, p(k) denotes the probability of
nodes with degree k in the network. The power-law degree distribution exponents γ
of the four probability density function are γβ=2 = 3.11 ± 0.05, γβ=1 = 3.11 ± 0.05,
γβ=0 = 2.93 ± 0.04, γβ=−1 = 2.96 ± 0.05 and γβ=−2 = 2.95 ± 0.04.

3.2 Average distance

The average distance is also one of the most important parameters to mea-
sure the eﬃciency of communication networks, which is deﬁned as the mean
distance over all pairs of nodes. The average distance plays a signiﬁcant role
in measuring the transmission delay. Firstly, we give the following lemma [39].

Fig. 2. (Color Online) The dependence between the average distance D and the order
N of the present network, when β = 1 and m = 4. One can see that L increases
very slowly as lnN increases. The inset exhibits the curve where L is considered as
a function of N . All the data are obtained by 10 independent simulations.

Lemma 1 For any two nodes i and j, each shortest path from i to j does

not pass through any nodes k satisfying that k > max{i, j}.

Proof. Denote the shortest path from the node i to j of length n + 1 by
i → x1 → x2 · · · → xn → j(SPij), where n > 0. Suppose that xk =
max{x1, x2, · · · , xn}, if xk ≤ max{i, j}, then the conclusion is true. If xk >
max{i, j}, denote the youngest node of SPij by k. Denote the subpath pass-
ing through node k by l → k → r, where the node l and r are the neighbors
of node k, then we can prove that node l and r are connected. The shortest
path SPij passes from the node l to r directly, which is conﬂicted with the
hypothesis.

Let d(i, j) represent the distance between node i and j and σ(N) as the total
P1≤i<j≤N d(i, j). The average distance of the present

distance, i.e., σ(N) =
model with order N, denoted by L(N), is deﬁned as following

L(N) =

2σ(N)
N(N − 1)

.

σ(N + 1) = σ(N) +

d(i, N + 1).

N

i=1

Assume that the (N + 1)th node is added to the edge Ey1y2, then Equ. (10)
can be rewritten as

σ(N + 1) = σ(N) + N +

D(i, y),

N

X
i=1

where D(i, y) = min{d(i, y1), d(i, y2)}. Denote y as the edge connected the
node y1 and y2 continuously, then we have the following equation

σ(N + 1) = σ(N) + N + X
i=Λ

d(i, y),

where the node set Λ = {1, 2, · · · , N}−{y1, y2} has (N −2) members. The sum
Pi=Λ d(i, y) can be considered as the distance from each node of the network
to node y in the present model with order N − 2. Approximately, the sum
Pi=Λ d(i, y) is equal to L(N − 2). Hence we have

d(i, y) ≈ (N − 2)L(N − 2).

X
i=Λ

Because the average distance L(N) increases monotonously with N, this yields

(N − 2)L(N − 2) = (N − 2)

2σ(N − 2)
(N − 2)(N − 3)

<

2σ(N)

Then we can obtain the inequality

σ(N + 1) < σ(N) + N +

2σ(N)
N − 1

.

dσ(N)

2σ(N)

This leads to the following solution

7

Enlarge σ(N), then the upper bound of the increasing tendency of σ(N) reads

σ(N) = (N − 1)2log(N − 1) + C1(N − 1)2 − (N − 1).

3.3 Clustering property

The small-world characteristic consists of two properties: large clustering
coeﬃcient and small average distance. The clustering coeﬃcient, denoted by
Ci
C, is deﬁned as C =
N , where Ci is the local clustering coeﬃcient for
node i. Ci is

N
i=1

P

Ci =

2E(i)
ki(ki − 1)

,

(18)

where E(i) is the number of edges in the neighbor set of the node i, and ki
is the degree of node i. When the node i is added to the network, it is of
degree m + mPt and E(i) = mPt. If a new node is added to be a neighbor of i
at some time step, E(i) will increase by mPt since the newly added node will
connect with one of the neighbors of the node i with probability Pt. Therefore,
in terms of ki, the expression of E(i) can be written as

E(i) = mPt + Pt[ki − (m + mPt)].

This expression indicates that the local clustering scales as C(k) ∼ k−1, where
C(k) denotes the average clustering coeﬃcient value of nodes with degree k. It
is interesting that a similar scaling has been observed in many artiﬁcial models
[38,39,40,41] and several real-world networks [42]. The degree-dependent aver-
age clustering coeﬃcient C(k) has been demonstrated in Fig. 4. Consequently,
we have

The numerical results are demonstrated in Fig.3. From ﬁgure 3, we can get that
if β ≤ 0, the numerical results are consistent with the theoretical predictions
approximately, while if β > 0, the ﬂuctuations emerges. The departure from
analysis results is observed, which may attribute to the ﬂuctuations of the
power-law exponent of degree distribution. It is also helpful to compare the
present method with previous analysis approaches on clustering coeﬃcient for
Holme-Kim model [43,44].

3.4 Assortative coeﬃcient

The assortative coeﬃcient r can be calculated from

(24)

where ji, ki are the degrees of the vertices of the ith edge, for i = 1, 2, · · · , M
[45,46].

From Fig. 5, we can ﬁnd that when β > 0 the assortative coeﬃcient r
increases with the probability Pt, while r decreases with the probability Pt
when β < 0. As β = 0, r equals to zero approximately.

4 Conclusion and Discussion

In this paper, we propose a simple rule that generates scale-free small-world
networks with tunable assortative coeﬃcient. The inspiration of this model
is to introduce the parameter β to Holme-Kim model. The simulation results
are consistent with the theoretical predictions approximately. Interestingly, we
obtain the nontrivial clustering coeﬃcient C and tunable degree assortativity
r, depending on the parameters β. The model can unify the characterization of
both assortative and disassortative networks. Specially, studying the degree-
dependent average clustering coeﬃcient C(k) also provides us with a better

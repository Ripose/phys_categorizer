This work is a study of the properties of collaboration networks employing the formalism of
weighted graphs to represent their one–mode projection. The weight of the edges is directly the
number of times that a partnership has been repeated. This representation allows us to deﬁne
the concept of social inertia that measures the tendency of authors to keep on collaborating with
previous partners. We use a collection of empirical datasets to analyze several aspects of the social
inertia: 1) its probability distribution, 2) its correlation with other properties, and 3) the correlations
of the inertia between neighbors in the network. We also contrast these empirical results with the
predictions of a recently proposed theoretical model for the growth of collaboration networks.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The study of complex networks has recently raisen a
great interest in a very multidisciplinary community (for
recent reviews on the ﬁeld see [1, 2, 3, 4]). Complex net-
work theory provides mathematical tools to directly deal
with such intricate systems as for instance the Internet or
the World-Wide Web [5, 6, 7]. These two cases are real
incarnations of mathematical graphs, however the appli-
cability of the theory may be extended to many other
situations. Actually, any system composed of a set of in-
teracting elements may be represented as a graph. The
vertices correspond to the basic objects in the system,
and the edges model the interactions among them. Pro-
tein interaction networks constitute a good example of
how insight may be gained into the micro and macro be-
havior of a massively complex system using graph theory
[8, 9, 10].

Human society is also an extraordinarily complex sys-
tem that can be analyzed using the same theoretical con-
cepts. In this particular case, the vertices represent in-
dividuals and the edges social interactions such as pro-
fessional, friendship, or family relationships. The study
of such networks promises to provide quantitative un-
derstanding of human collective behavior. To date, the
biggest problem of studying social systems has been the
absence of large databases from which reliable statistical
conclusions could be drafted. Nevertheless, for a special
sort of social networks, the so called collaboration net-
works, that restriction no longer exists . The current
size of the digital databases is big enough to allow the
statistical characterization of the network topology and
the comparison of empirical results with the predictions
produced by theoretical models.

Collaboration networks are composed by two kind of
vertices: 1) actors, which are the persons involved in col-
laborations (such as movie or theater actors, paper or

∗Electronic address: jose.ramasco@emory.edu

book authors, football players, or corporate board mem-
bers), and 2) the collaboration acts (movies, theater per-
formances, scientiﬁc papers, books, common membership
in a football team, or common membership on a corpo-
rate board). In a collaboration network, the undirected
edges connect the actors to the collaborations in which
they have taken part. The fact that there exist two very
diﬀerent type of vertices in the network is a central prop-
erty that determines its structure [11, 12]. For this rea-
son, these networks are usually known as bipartite graphs
and they are just a very particular class of a wider set
of complex networks with a variety of vertex types. In
order to study their topology, the standard method is to
perform a one–mode projection of the original network
where only the nodes representing actors remain and are
connected to each other whenever they share the same
collaboration [5, 13]. Since this procedure neglects multi-
ple common collaborations, the resulting projected graph
is less informative than the original bipartite network. A
way to partially avoid such a loss of information is the use
a weighted network for the projection [14]. While collab-
oration graphs were originally studied as having binary
weighted links: 0 for no collaborations, 1 for one or more
collaborations, weighted networks are graphs in which
each link is associated with an edge weight, whose mag-
nitude can range from 0 to inﬁnity [15, 16]. In this work,
the link weight in the projected network is the number
of times a collaboration between two actors has been re-
peated. In collections of journal papers, it represents the
number of papers that a pair of authors have published
together. Hence, the study of the weight distribution and
how it relates to the number of diﬀerent co-actors allows
to extract information about the level of conservatism
of the people at the hour of collaborate with diﬀerent
partners, a property that we will call social inertia.

This paper is organized as follows: in Sec. II we intro-
duce the concepts and magnitudes that we are going to
use to analyze one-mode projected networks as weighted
graphs. In the Section III, we present the results of anal-
ysis of a collection of empirical collaboration networks.
After that, in Sec. IV, the results obtained from a theo-

retical model are compared with those coming out from
the empirical study. Finally, in Sec. V, we end by dis-
cussing the signiﬁcance of social inertia as a model and
empirical phenomenon.

i that we will call social inertia:

Ii = si/ki.

(2)

The inertia is a new quantity that can be deﬁned in gen-
eral for all weighted graphs but that has a very spe-
cial meaning for the social networks.
Its range goes
from Ii = 1, in the case of newcomers and actors that
never repeat a collaborator, to qi, if all his/her collabora-
tions were carried out always with the same team. The
higher Ii is, the more the actor i repeats his/her col-
laborators and consequently the more conservative ac-
tor i is about working with new people. Ii is also re-
lated to the probability that the actor i repeats with
one of his/her former collaborators by the expression
Ri = 1 − (ki/si) = 1 − (1/Ii). It is important to stress
here that 1 − hRi is not equal the global ratio between
the number of edges and the number of partnerships in
the networks expressed as

Rks =

Total number of edges
Total number of partnerships

=

hki
hsi

.

As happens with the previously introduced parameters,
it is possible to deﬁne probability distributions for ﬁnding
a node with a certain strength value s, Ps(s) or a certain
inertia I, PI(I). However, only three of the previous
distributions are a priori independent (in the absence
of correlations among the diﬀerent variables), let us say
Pn(n), Pq(q) and Pw(w). The others should be derived
from these three basic functions.

In addition to the probability distributions, we also
measure some other quantities that further characterize
the topology of networks. The clustering is a good ex-
ample of such magnitudes. The clustering is the density
of triangles in the network and hence it estimates how
far the graph is from a tree-like structure. For a vertex
i, the deﬁnition of the clustering of i is given by

ci =

2 ti
ki (ki − 1)

,

(4)

where ti is the number of connections between the neigh-
bors of i. This concept may be generalized for weighted
networks by means of the following expression [16]

cw
i =

1

si (ki − 1) X

j,m∈V(i)

(wij + wim)
2

aij aim ajm,

(5)

where aij is equal to one only if there is an edge be-
tween the vertices i and j and zero otherwise. It is sim-
ple to check that the deﬁnition of cw
i reduces to that of
ci when there is just one possible value for the weight
of the links. These two previous deﬁnitions refer only
to local quantities, they can be easily transformed into
global parameters by averaging over all the vertices of
the network. In this way, we deﬁne the global clustering
C = hcii and global weighted clustering Cw = hcw
i i. For
a good comprehensive review on the characterization of
complex weighted networks, see [16].

II. ONE-MODE PROJECTIONS OF
COLLABORATION NETWORKS AS WEIGHTED
GRAPHS

Let us discuss ﬁrst some of the quantities used to char-
acterize collaboration networks. A typical network is
composed of Nc collaborations and of Na actors. Of
these actors, not all have collaborators, Nai of them work
alone. There are several degree distribution functions
characterizing the network, two of which are fundamen-
tal. The ﬁrst, Pn(n), describes the probability that a col-
laboration has a given size n. While the second, Pq(q),
represents the probability that an actor has participated
in a total of q collaborations. As a result of the one-mode
projection, another degree distribution may be deﬁned
for the projected network Pk(k). Note that the mean-
ing of k is the number of diﬀerent partners that an actor
(author) has had during his/her carrier.

As explained above, we will consider the one-mode pro-
jected network as a weighted graph. For an edge between
actor i and actor j, the weight, wij , will be equal to the
number of collaborations between them. Notice that this
deﬁnition is diﬀerent from the one widely used in the
literature [13, 17, 18, 19]. Once the weight of links is
deﬁned, we can also study its distribution, Pw(w), as the
probability that a randomly chosen edge has a certain
weight w. The existence of a weight for the edges may
change the importance of the vertices within the network.
Typically, the most signiﬁcant nodes of a graph, at least
from a transport point of view, are those with the highest
number of connections, the hubs. However, in weighted
networks the link degree is not necessarily the most cen-
tral property in that sense. If the dispersion of Pw(w) is
very high, it may be preferable to have ”high quality” con-
nections to your neighbors, even if few in number, than
having ”low quality” connections to many neighbors. To
take this fact into account, another metric characterizing
the vertices is deﬁned. This new variable is called vertex
strength and measures a combination of weight and num-
ber of edges. For a particular vertex i, the strength of i
is deﬁned as:

si = X
j∈V(i)

wij ,

(1)

where the sum runs over the set of all neighbors of i, V(i).
The strength of a vertex denotes the total number of
partnerships (papers or movies) in which a particular ac-
tor has been involved. This magnitude together with the
degree of the nodes in the one-mode projected network
ki, which contains the information about how many of
those partnerships have been with diﬀerent persons, al-
low us to deﬁne a measure of the conservatism of an actor

Other signiﬁcant aspects of the network topology
are the correlations of the main properties like degree,
strength or inertia among neighboring vertices. The
mean degree of the nearest neighbors is a very informa-
tive magnitude in this respect [7, 12, 20]. For a vertex i,
it is deﬁned as

This quantity may also be expressed as a function of the
degree, knn(k), by averaging over all nodes of the network
with degree k. If there are positive degree correlation be-
tween neighboring nodes (the high degree vertices tend to
be connected to high degree vertices or assortative mix-
ing), knn(k) should grow with increasing k. The contrary
trend should be observed if the network shows anticorre-
lation between the degree of the neighbors (disassortative
mixing). The same general idea may be applied to other
properties of the vertices [21] as for instance, the inertia
of the nearest neighbors as a function of the own inertia,
Inn(I), which is of special relevance for this work.

green (dashed) curves are the results from the model simula-
tion.

In this section, we analyze some databases covering a
range of social communities. As may be seen in Table I,
our biggest network corresponds to the IMDB database
on movies that includes as many as 127823 productions.
In this case, the collaboration acts are movies or TV
series in which actors, previously hired by a producer,
perform. Here the decision mechanism about the cast is
diﬀerent from the process of selecting authors for scien-

tiﬁc collaborations. The question about who is going to
be an author of a scientiﬁc paper is typically decided in a
more self-organized way. This fact explains the low aver-
age inertia that the movie network displays, hIi = 1.045.
However, it is important to note that the low value of
hIi is the only distinguishable characteristic of the movie
database over the others. In particular, a higher or lower
value of hIi does not imply that the distribution PI (I) is

short tailed. Another striking aspect of Table I already
among the scientiﬁc networks refers to the disparity in
the individualist ratio (Nai/Ns) between social and nat-
ural science papers, being much higher in the former ones.
Although a marked diﬀerence in that ratio (almost a fac-
tor two) may be either observed between experimental
and theoretical works on natural sciences. Regarding the
inertia among scientiﬁc collaborations, authors on social
sciences (those that do not work alone) tend to show the
lowest average values of I followed by the experimental
articles of natural sciences. For topics in the same area,
I could be probably also related to the dynamism/age of
the ﬁeld.

One of the easier to detect eﬀects pointing to the neces-
sity of the use of weighted networks to describe collabo-
ration graphs is the behavior of hkiq as illustrated in Fig.
1. The meaning of this quantity is the average total num-
ber of diﬀerent partners that an actor with experience q
has had along his/her professional career. In an idealized
situation where the actors did not show any tendency to
repeat collaborators, this magnitude should follow a lin-
ear growth with q. hkiq would approach (hni − 1) q, or
even (hni − 1) q/hwi if we admit the existence of a sharp
Pw(w) distribution centered around hwi. However, the
empirically measured hkiq functions do not show linear
growth in any of our networks. These functions are bet-
ter ﬁtted by power laws with exponents in the range from
0.5 to 0.8, with reservations due to the short q range in
some cases, than by straight lines. The reason behind
this peculiar behavior of hkiq is the nontrivial structure
of Pw(w).
Instead of being a Gaussian or some other
smooth distribution centered around hwi, Pw(w) falls
in a power law-like way for high w as may be seen in
Fig. 2. Actually, for most of our networks Pw(w) ad-
justs better to a power law than the distributions Pq(q)

or Pk(k). Figure 2, instead of plotting Pw(w), plots the
w dw′ Pw(w′) and
cumulative distributions Cw(w) = R
s ds′ Ps(s′) for the movie network. Note that
Cs(s) = R
if Pw(w) ∼ w−δ, Cw(w) ∼ w−δ+1. The estimated values
for the exponent δ obtained from the diﬀerent databases
are listed in Table I. Typically, the value of δ is high,
between 3 and 6. Nevertheless, the distribution Pw(w)
seems in general to be incompatible with any faster decay
as for instance an exponential tail.

∞

As mentioned above, for weighted bipartite networks
in the absence of correlations there are only three inde-
pendent distributions. This means that the functional
shape of PI (I) should be a consequence of the shapes of
other distributions like Pn(n), Pq(q) and Pw(w). In Fig-
I dI′ PI (I′)
ure 3, the cumulative distribution CI = R
is displayed for the movie and the scientiﬁc publication
on biosensor databases. In this ﬁgure, we have plotted
the cumulative inertia distribution versus I − 1. The dis-
tribution represented in this way shows an initial oﬀset
followed by a relatively long tail for high values of I. It
is hard to ascertain whether the asymptotic behavior of
PI (I) continues or not because of the limited range of
values of I. The inertia is deﬁned as a ratio between the
strength and the degree and hence a certain value of I
means that the strength is actually I times bigger than
the degree. Therefore, the values that the inertia can at-
tain are conditioned very strongly by the network size. In
the rest of the networks, the main trend presented in Fig.
3 repeats even though in some cases the network size is
too small to reliably determine the statistical signiﬁcance
of the results.

Another interesting feature of inertia is its dependence
on the age of the actors. One would expect the older ac-
tors to be more conservative but is it really the case? We

cannot study this issue directly because our databases
do not contain the age of the actors. The best we can
do is to associate the age with the experience q. Hence,
we have depicted in Fig. 4 the average inertia of all the
actors with a certain experience q as a function of q for
the databases on movies and on scientiﬁc publications
on superstrings. In these two cases, contrasting behav-
ior may be observed. The actors in the movie database,
similar to the authors of some of the scientiﬁc publication
databases (e.g., atrial ablation, botox), become increas-
ingly conservative as they acquire experience, although
the increase in hIiq is not linear with q. While in the
case of the superstring community, as well as in other
scientiﬁc specialties (biosensors, condmat, etc) there is a
saturation in the value that hIiq can attain with q.

The last aspect that we shall contemplate about the
inertia is the correlations between the inertia of neigh-
boring actors. Do conservative actors like to collaborate
with conservative counterparts? The answer to this ques-
tion is displayed in Fig. 5. There the average inertia of
the nearest neighbors is depicted as a function of the own
inertia for the movie database and for the publication on
info science. In both cases, as in all the other databases
studied, it is clear that there is a positive correlation of an
author’s inertia to the inertia of the author’s collabora-
tors. In some of the networks the growth appears linear,
but in some others, e.g., the movie database, the curves
are better ﬁtted by power laws with exponents as low as
0.4.

IV. THEORETICAL MODEL

Several models have been proposed to mimic the de-
velopment of collaboration networks [11, 18, 19, 29]. In

this work, we shall focus on one model that combines a
certain simplicity in the rules with acceptable results for
the topology of the network, including properties such
as the correlations or the size of the giant component. It
was proposed and studied in Refs. [30, 31, 33, 34]. In this
section, we will address the question whether this model
is able or not to reproduce the empirically observed be-
havior of actors social inertia. The rules of the model are
as follows:

1. At each step a new collaboration of size n is in-
troduced in the system. n may be a ﬁxed external
parameter or may be obtained as a random variable
from a distribution Pn(n). We use this latter option
with an exponential decaying Pn(n) that is the clos-
est functional form to the empirical observed col-
laboration size distribution. This means that the
parameter hni has to be externally provided.

2. Out of the n collaborators, m are newcomers with-
out previous experience. Again m may be a ﬁxed
external number or it may be derived from a ran-
dom distribution. We have checked both possibil-
ities, taking always into account the obvious con-
straint m ≤ n.

3. The remaining n − m actors are chosen from the
pool of experienced individuals in the following
way:

(a) with probability p, one of the experienced ac-
tors already in the present collaboration (if
there is some) is randomly selected and one of
his/her partners from previous collaborations
is chosen to participate in the new collabo-

ration with a probability proportional to the
number of times they have worked together.

(b) with probability 1 − p, an experienced actor
is selected with a probability proportional to
his/her experience q.

4. After the collaboration is complete, each actor up-
dates his/her experience q′
i → qi + 1. The actors
can then become inactive, ineligible for the previous
rule, if their experience is higher than an externally
introduced threshold, q > Qc, with a probability
1/τ .

The last rule is introduced to account for the limited
professional life time of actors. This fact has also an im-
portant impact on the network correlations as was shown
in [30], only contemporaneous active actors can carry out
a work together. The model has hence ﬁve external pa-
rameters apart form the network size. Some like hni and
m = Na/Nc are easy to estimate from empirical data.
To approach p, we must consider the two sources for new
edges during the growth process: the newcomers and the
old actors added by rule 3b. The probability p can be
then approximated from the empirical values of Rks, and
the moments hni and hn2i of the collaboration size distri-
bution Pn(n). Finally, Qc and τ are chosen according to
the trends observed in the empirical Pq(q) distributions.
The values of these parameters used in the simulations,
together with the results for the main global magnitudes
characterizing the topology of the networks, are displayed
in Table II. We have selected the parameters of the largest
empirical networks for the simulation. In each case, the
number of collaborations simulated is Nc = 105.

As may be seen in Table II, the model reproduces rel-
atively well the global parameters for the ﬁrst three net-
works (movies, biosensors and condmat) but fails to do
so for the other two networks (info science and super-
strings). The reason might be the diﬀerent degree of het-
erogeneity of the databases. IMDB and condmat compre-
hend the output of several independent communities: the
IMDB includes a variety of movie genders that can be as-
sumed to be starred by separate non-overlapping groups
of actors, and the papers submitted to condmat deal
with a range of topics from experimental and theoreti-
cal solid state physics to statistical physics produced by
diversiﬁed scientiﬁc communities. These heterogeneous
networks are more suitable to be modeled just with a
simple set of general rules. On the hand, publications
on superstrings and on info science should correspond
to more homogeneous scientiﬁc communities where other
factors such as citations can have an important impact.
More detailed results from the simulations are repre-
sented in Figures 1 to 5, green (dashed) curves. The
model fails in all cases to mimic the nonlinear depen-
dence of hkiq with q. Despite of that, the cumulative
distributions Cw(w), Cs(s) and CI (I) (Figs 2 and 3) are
qualitatively well reproduced by the model with perhaps
some minor problems at the very end of the tails due
to the aging mechanism. Regarding the correlations, the

6

predicted hIiq adjust well to the superstring data (see
inset of Figure 4) reproducing even the saturation ob-
served. It does not match so well though the behavior
of the IMDB movie network. Finally, the inertia-inertia
correlation trend, more conservative actors tend to col-
laborate with conservative counterparts, is also observed
in the model. Although, the agreement with the empiri-
cal networks is only qualitative.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In summary, we have studied collaboration networks of
several disciplines using weighted networks to represent
the one-mode projections of the full bipartite network.
This representation allows us to deﬁne social inertia, as
the ratio between the number of collaborators and the
total number of partnerships. This new metric can be
in general deﬁned in all weighted graphs. It has a very
special meaning though in the speciﬁc case of social net-
works:
it quantitatively measures the tendency of the
actors to repeat the same collaborators. We have shown
that the inertia of the actors in empirical networks dis-
plays features characteristic of complex systems. The
distribution of I is long tailed and its dependence with
the experience or the correlations between the inertia of
coauthors are far from trivial. We have found that the
inertia generally grows with the experience though it sat-
urates for some networks. At the same time, we have also
shown that conservative actors have a strong tendency
(that can be quantiﬁed) to collaborate with conservative
actors. This is, we hope, another eﬀort towards a more
quantitative Sociology taking advantage of the develop-
ments of other branches of Science such as Statistical
Physics and Graph Theory.

We have also studied the predictions of a theoretical
growth model for collaboration networks. This model
is the simplest that is able to reproduce some evolved
topological properties of empirical networks such as the
degree-degree correlations. The results of the simulation
are in qualitative agreement with the real networks ob-
servations. However, in the search for a more quanti-
tative insight of the network growth process there are
still several open issues. One is the connection of the
co-authorship network development with other aspects
of the system as, for example citation networks that has
been discussed in recent publications, and its quantiﬁ-
cation. Another is a more detailed study about the in-
ﬂuence that some other author factors as age, scientiﬁc
structures such as research groups, projects or even big
research facilities may have on the topology of the col-
laboration network.

projected network as a weighted graph contains the same
degree of information as the full bipartite network. In
order to reconstruct the full bipartite graph from the one–
more projection, it would be necessary to know exactly
to which movie every unit of the link weigth corresponds.

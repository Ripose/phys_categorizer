Abstract

The empirical relation between density and velocity (fundamental diagram) of pedestrian
movement is not completely analyzed, particularly with regard to the ‘microscopic’ causes
which determine the relation at medium and high densities. The simplest system for the
investigation of this dependency is the single-ﬁle movement of pedestrians. This article
presents experimental results for this system and discusses the following observations. The
data show a linear relation between the velocity and the inverse of the density, which can
be regarded as the required length of one pedestrian to move. Furthermore we compare
the results for the single-ﬁle movement with literature data for the movement in a plane.
This comparison shows an unexpected conformance between the fundamental diagrams,
indicating that lateral interference has negligible inﬂuence on the velocity-density relation.
In addition we test a procedure for automatic recording of pedestrian ﬂow characteristics.
We present preliminary results on measurement range and accuracy of this method.

Introduction

Pedestrian dynamics has a multitude of practical applications, like the evaluation of escape
routes or the optimization of pedestrian facilities, along with some more theoretical questions
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Empirical studies of pedestrian streams can be traced back to the year 1937
[5]. To this day a central problem is the relation between density and ﬂow or velocity. This
dependency is termed the fundamental diagram and has been the subject of many investiga-
tions from the very beginning [6, 7, 3, 8, 9, 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. This relation quantiﬁes
the capacity of pedestrian facilities and thus allows e.g. the rating of escape routes. Further-
more, the fundamental diagram is used for the evaluation of models for pedestrian movement
[16, 17, 18, 19], and is a primary test whether the model is suitable for the description of
pedestrians streams [20, 21, 22, 23].
The velocity-density relation diﬀers for various facilities like stairs, ramps, bottlenecks or
halls. Moreover one has to distinguish between uni- or bi-directional streams. The simplest
system in this enumeration is the uni-directional movement of pedestrians in a plane without
bottlenecks. In this context the fundamental diagram of Weidmann [24] is frequently cited.
It is a part of a review work and the author summarized 25 diﬀerent investigations for the

1

determination of the fundamental diagram. Apart from the fact, that with growing density
the velocity decreases, the relation shows a non-trivial form. Weidmann notes that diﬀerent
authors choose diﬀerent approaches to ﬁt their data, indicating that the dependency is not
completely analyzed. A multitude of possible eﬀects can be considered which may inﬂuence
the dependency. For instance we refer to passing maneuvers, internal friction, self-organization
phenomena or ordering phenomena like the ‘zipper’ eﬀect [25]. A reduction of the degrees
of freedom helps to restrict possible eﬀects and allows an improved insight to the problem.
To exclude in a natural way the inﬂuences of passing maneuver, internal friction or ordering
phenomena we choose a one-dimensional system.
Furthermore, we test a procedure for automatic recording of pedestrian ﬂow characteristics.
This method uses stereo video processing and allows the determination of trajectories of
individual persons. We present preliminary results on measurement range and accuracy of
this method.

2 Movement in a plane

In the ﬁeld of pedestrian dynamics there are two diﬀerent ways to quantify the capacity
of pedestrian facilities. Either the relation between density ρ and velocity v or the rela-
tion between density and ﬂow Φ = ρ v is represented. Following Weidmann we choose the
presentation of density and velocity.

[8]) movement

eﬀects which reduce the velocity. We discuss possible causes for this slope-variation by means
of the Level of Service concept (LOS) [4, 3, 24].

Domain I ρ < 0.7 At low densities there is a small and increasing decline of the velocity.
The velocity is mostly determined by the individual free velocity of the pedestrians.
Passing maneuvers for keeping the desired velocity are possible. The decrease is caused
by the passing maneuvers.

Domain II 0.7 ≤ ρ < 2.3 The velocity decrease is nearly linear with growing density. Due
to the reduction of the available space, passing maneuvers of slower pedestrians are
hardly feasible and the possibility to choose the desired velocity is restricted. At least
at uni-directional streams the available space is large enough to avoid contacts with
other pedestrians. Thus the internal friction can only be of negligible inﬂuence.

Domain III 2.3 ≤ ρ < 4.7 The linear decrease of the velocity ends and the curvature changes.
For growing density the velocity remains nearly constant. Contacts with other pedes-
trians are hardly avoidable. While the internal friction increases compared with domain
II, the reduction of the velocity diminishes.

Domain IV ρ ≥ 4.7 The velocity declines rapidly. The available space is strongly restricted.
Internal friction may be a determining factor. There has to be a maximal density
because the pedestrians behave like hard bodies.

As pointed out, there are several hints to eﬀects which can inﬂuence the reduction of the
velocity at diﬀerent densities. But it is not clear which ‘microscopic’ properties of pedestrian
movement lead to the nearly linear decrease of the velocity and to a slower decrease at high
densities. Particularly the possible inﬂuence of the internal friction is contradictory to the
slope of the velocity-density relation. We have to clarify the inﬂuences of collective behavior
like marching in lock-step [9] or self-organization phenomena like the ’zipper’ eﬀect, which
can be observed at bottlenecks [25].

3 Single-ﬁle movement

3.1 Description of the experiment

Our target is the measurement of the relation between density and velocity for the single-ﬁle
movement of pedestrians. To facilitate this with a limited amount of test persons also for
high densities and without boundary eﬀects, we choose a experimental set-up similar to the
set-up in [7].
The corridor, see Figure 2, is build up with chairs and ropes. The width of the passageway
in the measurement section is 0.8 m. Thus passing is prevented and the single-ﬁle movement
is enforced. The circular guiding of the passageway gives periodic boundary conditions. To
reduce the eﬀects of the curves on the measurement, we broaden the corridor in the curve
and choose the position of the measured section in the center of the straight part of the
passageway. The length of the measured section is lm = 2 m and the whole corridor is
lp = 17.3 m. The experiment is located in the auditorium Rotunde at the Central Institute
for Applied Mathematics (ZAM) of the Research Centre J¨ulich. The group of test persons is
composed of students of Technomathematics and staﬀ of ZAM. The test persons are instructed

to omit passing and not to hurry. This results in a rather relaxed conduct, i. e. the resulting
free velocities are rather low. To enable measurements at diﬀerent densities we execute six
cycles with N = 1, 15, 20, 25, 30, 34 numbers of test persons in the passageway. For the cycle
with N = 1 every person passes alone through the corridor. For the other cycles we ﬁrst
distribute the persons uniformly in the corridor. After the instruction to get going, every
person passes the passageway two to three times. After that we open the passageway and let
the test persons get out.

3.2 Measurement set-up

For the measurement of the ﬂow characteristics we use both a manual and an automatic
procedure. The manual procedure is based on standard video recordings with a DV camera
(PAL format, 25 fps) of the measured section. These recordings are prepared on a computer
to show time, frame number and the limits of the measured section. After the preparation
the recordings were analyzed frame-wise, thus the accuracy of the extracted time is 0.04 s.
To minimize the errors for extracting time data, the collected time is transferred by cut and
paste between the video editing system and the spread sheet. Figure 3 shows one frame of
the cycle with N = 20 persons. For every test person i we collect the entrance time (of the
i and the exit time tout
ear) in the measurement section tin
. To ease the assignment of times
the test persons carry numbers.
Additionally we test an automated procedure, based on a commercial system of Point Grey
Research [26]. The system is composed of the Bumblebee stereo vision camera and the
software packages Digiclops, Triclops and Censys3d. The software uses stereo recordings for
detection and tracking of peoples. The resulting trajectories allow the analysis of pedestrian
movement in space and time. For this measurement we use a bumblebee BW-BB-20. The
analysis device is an IBM ThinkPad T30 with an Intel Pentium 4 Mobile CPU (512 MB RAM)
and the operating system WIN XP SP1. The data transfer from the camera to the analysis
device is realized via FireWire and a PCMCIA FireWire card. Following the recommendation
of the manufactures we decide to process the data directly without storing the pictures on a
hard disk. In our measurement setup we are bounded on a transfer rate to the analysis device
of about 2 times 20 frames per second with a resolution of 320 x 240 pixels.

3.3 Data analysis

The manual analysis uses the entrance and exit times tin
. These two times allow
the calculation of the individual velocities vman
= lm/(tout
i ) and the momentary number
n(t) of persons at time t in the measured section. The concept of a momentary ‘density’ in
the measurement region is problematic because of the small (1-5) number of persons involved.

In Figure 3 the ‘fractions’ are Θ6(t) ≈ 0.6, Θ7(t) = 1, Θ8(t) ≈ 0.8, Θ9(t) = 0, resulting in
ρ(t) ≈ 1.2 m−1. This is 3 persons per 2.5 m, which is about the distance between person
number 6 and number 9. The time average of ˜ρ man and ρman is almost the same.
Figure 4 shows the development of the density and velocity of individual persons in time.
At the beginning the pedestrians do not react simultaneously and they have to tune their
movement. After the tuning phase one sees regular ﬂuctuations of the density and the velocity.
It becomes obvious that these ‘microscopic’ ﬂuctuations are correlated. After the opening of
the passageway the density declines and as a consequence the velocity grows. To consider
this correlation in the analysis we regard a crossing of an individual pedestrian i with velocity

the end of the cycle.

and 34. The cycles with N = 15, 20 and 25 result in clearly separated areas of densities and
velocities. These areas blend for the cycles with N = 30 and 34.
The automated procedure uses the trajectories for the analysis. The accuracy of the trajectory
measurement depends on many factors, like the size of the covered area, the capability of the
analysis device and the settings of parameters in software Censys3d for people detection
and tracking.
In test-runs we optimize these parameters for normal and not too crowded
conditions. But during the experiment we realized that the system is too sensitive and with
growing density the mismeasurements increase. For example we observe the loss of trajectories
or person with two trajectories. Due to the mismeasurements the determination of densities
or other microscopic values like the distance between the pedestrians is not reliable. The
resulting trajectories are thus only appropriate for the calculation of the mean value of the
velocity. For this purpose we determine for every crossing pedestrian i the ﬁrst (xf
i ) and
the last point (xl
i) of the trajectory in the measured section and calculate the velocity
i = (xl
through vaut
In the next step we test if the mismeasurements lead to systematic errors in the determination
of the velocities and cross-check the data from the manual analysis. For this we exclude the
data where the inﬂuence of the starting phase and opening of the passageway are apparent.
To reduce the inﬂuence of mismeasurements we take into account only these trajectories,
which last for at least one second.

Table 1: Comparison of mean values and standard deviations (σ) gained from the automated
and manual procedure.

Aside from local ﬂuctuations, possible reasons for the deviations of the densities ρman and
ρ are the inﬂuence of the curve and the broadening of the passageway in the curve. The
mean velocities calculated automatically agree roughly with the velocities extracted from the
manual procedure. We get a very good agreement for medium densities N = 15, 20. Notable
deviations arise at high velocities and high densities. The mismeasurements caused by loosing
and picking up of trajectories increase the ﬂuctuations (σ). The deviation of the mean value
for the cycle with N = 1 from the literature value vf ree = 1.34 m/s according to Weidmann,
can be explained by the instruction to the test persons not to hurry.

4 Results

To compare the relation between velocity and density of the single-ﬁle movement (1d) with
the movement in a plane (2d), we have to transform the line-density to a area-density.

1d + C(ρ)

max and a hexagonal lattice ρhex

The correction term C(ρ) is introduced to take into account that the ordering of the pedes-
trians in two dimensions does not occur in a square lattice. To estimate the correction
term at high densities we calculate the diﬀerence between the maximal possible density in
a square lattice ρsq
max. For this estimation we assume that the
projection of the human body is circular. According to Weidmann the maximum density is
max = 4.7 m−2 and a
max = 5.4 m−2 which corresponds to r = 0.23 m. Thus one gets ρsq
ρhex
correction term C(ρmax) = 0.7 m−2.
The comparison of the relation between velocity and density for the single-ﬁle movement with
the movement in a plane according to Weidmann shows a surprising conformity, see Figure
7. Both, the magnitude of the velocities and the qualitative shape at intermediate and high
densities agree. The similarity at high densities was expected because of the estimation of
C(ρ). For smaller densities one expects larger velocities for a movement with an additional
degree of freedom. But this did not occur for densities larger than one person per square
meter. The qualitative agreement with the fundamental diagram for the multi-lane or planar
movement indicates that two-dimensional speciﬁc properties, like internal friction and other
lateral interferences, have no strong inﬂuence on the fundamental diagram at least at the
density domains considered.

Figure 7: Comparison of the velocity-density relation for the single-ﬁle movement with the
movement in a plane according to Weidmann [24]. For the scaling of the line-density we
choose a constant correction term C(ρ) = 0.7 m−2, see Equation 2.

Instead, the visual analysis of the video recordings suggests that the following ‘microscopic’
properties of pedestrian movement determine the relation between velocity and density. At
intermediate densities and velocities the step length is reduced. The distance to the pedestrian
in front is related to the step length as well as to the safety margin to avoid contacts with
the pedestrian in front. Both, step length and safety margin are connected with the velocity.
At high densities and small velocities we observed that small groups pass into marching in
lock-step, see Figure 8. Furthermore the utilization of the available place is optimized. This
is achieved by some persons setting their feet far right and left of the line of movement,
giving some overlap in the space occupied with the pedestrian in front. While at intermediate
densities and relative high velocities the pedestrians are concentrated on their movement, this
concentration is reduced at smaller velocities and leads to a delayed reaction on the movement
of the pedestrian in front.
In the following we focus on the distance between the pedestrians. The sum of step length and
safety margin is the distance to the next close-by pedestrian. This distance can be regarded
as the required length d of one pedestrian to move with velocity v. Considering that in a
one-dimensional system the harmonic average of this quantity is the inverse of the density,
d = 1/ρ, one can investigate the relation between required length and velocity by means of
the velocity-density relation for the single-ﬁle movement.
Figure 9 shows the dependency between required length and velocity. We tested several
approaches for the function d = d(v) and found that a linear relationship with d = 0.36+1.06 v
gives the best ﬁt to the data. According to [24] the step length is a linear function of the
velocity and the walking-velocity has a lower bound of v ≈ 0.5 m/s2. Thus it is surprising,
that the linearity for the sum of step-length and safety margin holds even and persists for

velocities smaller than 0.5 m/s. Possible explanations are the marching in lock-steps and the
optimized utilization of the available space, which compensate the slower step frequency.

5 Summary and outlook

In the presented investigation we determine the fundamental diagram for the single-ﬁle move-
ment of pedestrians. The data are appropriate to test, if microscopic models are able to
reproduce the empirical relation between velocity and density in the simplest system.
The test of the automated procedure shows that this method is in principle capable to mea-
sure characteristics of pedestrian movement. The mean values of the velocities for diﬀerent
densities acquired automatically are comparable with those of the manual data analysis. To
facilitate the measurement of microscopic characteristics we plan to enlarge the resolution of
the stereo recordings and the transfer rate to the analysis system.
The comparison of the velocity-density relation for the single-ﬁle movement with the literature-
data for the movement in a plane shows a surprising agreement. The conformance indicates
that the internal friction and other lateral interferences, which are excluded in the single-ﬁle
movement, have no inﬂuence on the relation at the density domains considered. The visual
analysis of the video recording give hints to possible eﬀects, like the self-organization through
marching in lock-step, the optimized utilization of the available space at low velocities and the
velocity dependence of step-length and safety margin. The investigation of the dependency
between the required length of one pedestrian and velocity indicates a linear relation. For the
domain 0.1 m/s < v < 1.0 m/s we obtain d = 0.36 + 1.06 v. The investigation of the interplay
between the self-organization eﬀects and required length and thus a detailed quantiﬁcation
of these eﬀects will be possible after the improvement of the automated procedure.

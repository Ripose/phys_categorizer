Understanding how new opinions spread through a community or how consensus emerges in noisy
environments can have a signiﬁcant impact in our comprehension of the social relations among indi-
viduals. In this work a new model for the dynamics of opinion formation is introduced. The model
is based on a non-linear interaction between neighbor agents in a community, and has the possibility
of including a stochastic variable to account for the eﬀect of noise in the way the agents communi-
cate. Our results show that by increasing the intensity of noise, the system goes from consensus to
a disordered state. Depending on the number of competing opinions and the details of the network
of interactions, the system displays a ﬁrst or a second order transition. We present results for 1d
lattices, annealed, and complex networks. Our results indicate that the system dynamics is similar
in any complex network as well as in the annealed network.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The way diﬀerent opinions spread through a society
can aﬀect signiﬁcantly the life of its individuals. In recent
years, we have witnessed profound changes in social and
political values in very short periods of time. In this work
we aim to understand how new opinions propagate and
when people come to an agreement.

Social systems in general depend highly on external
sources and their interactions are likely to be based on
non-linear functions. Hence, their behavior is typically
out-of-equilibrium. Opinion spreading and the dynam-
ics of such systems has been investigated with increasing
interest in the last years [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11].
Models dealing with opinion dynamics usually reach
an absorbing state, where the individual behavior of the
agents still changes, but the macroscopic behavior follows
a well deﬁned dynamics or stationary state. The way in-
dividuals interact is usually modeled letting the agents lie
in a static network of connections, the interactions of an
agent being carried out only with its geometrically con-
nected neighbors. Having started from simple topologies
like one-dimensional chains, two-dimensional lattices, or
even random graphs, the research on this ﬁeld now fo-
cuses more on the more realistic topologies of complex
networks. It has been shown, for example, that real in-
teractions between humans as well as many animals, rely
on a topology of the type “small world” [12] or scale-free
networks [13, 14].

In the present study, we try to apply a general model,
where the agents interact according to a non-linear rule.
This rule is based on a Ising–like type of interaction. Ac-
cording to our model, undecided agents (i.e., those that
do not have a strong belief in one particular opinion) can
not aﬀect the ones with a strong opinion. This type of
interaction is somewhat diﬀerent to the one usually used

Stuttgart, Pfaﬀenwaldring 27, 70569 Stuttgart, Germany.

in models of opinion formation. In this last case the in-
teraction generally consists in weighted averaging [15].
Our model implies a tendency towards polarization, that
is, the agents are more likely to strong believe in one
of the possible opinions instead of having a mixed state
with two or more combined possibilities. Similar rules
have been used for example in Ref. [16] for the evolu-
tion of the language in a society. The results for diﬀerent
topologies are compared, beginning from simple ones like
random interactions and regular graphs, up to scale-free
networks.

II. THE OPINION MODEL

The system comprises a ﬁxed number of N agents. Ev-
ery agent i is characterized by its own opinion vector a(i)
n
of n = 1, .., O opinions. Each element of this vector corre-
sponds to a diﬀerent opinion about the same topic. Nega-
tive values of the elements are not allowed. For instance,
agent j favors communism with 20% and capitalism with
80% (given O = 2): a(j)
1 = 0.2, a(j)
2 = 0.8. Each time step
every agent actualizes its opinion vector by comparing its
values to the ones of k other agents. These other agents
are chosen by the topology of the graph, and the agent
updates its opinion vector due to the following rule,

ˆa(i)
n (t) =

n (t)a(l)
a(i)

n (t) + kg(t),

(1)

k

X
l=1

where g(t) presents a stochastic variable, distributed uni-
formly in the interval [0, η]. With this exclusively positive
noise we assure that a(i)
n (t) ≥ 0. This stochasticity can
be interpreted to be due to misunderstandings among
the agents, the spread of wrong information, or other
perturbing actions.

The interaction term in this model is of second or-
der. Thus, in a noiseless environment, the agents tend
to have the same stronger opinion. The factor k avoids
that agents which have more connections feel less noise.

between a1 and a3 results in {0.5, 0.5}—interactions of
agents with opposite opinions lead them to become less
decided.

At the beginning of a simulation the opinion vectors
are initialized either randomly or by consensus: for ran-
dom initialization we toss for each opinion component of
each agent a number between zero and one. The opinion
vectors are normalized afterwards according to Eq. (2).
The other way to initialize the system (consensus) is by
setting one to the ﬁrst element of each vector and ﬁll the
rest with zeroes.

The main parameter of this model is given by the max-
imal noise η which we will call from now on the control
parameter. Its role corresponds to the one of a tempera-
ture in physical systems. In a social system, the noise
represents any internal or external interference in the
communication among the agents. Other free parame-
ters of the system are given by the number of agents N ,
the number of opinions O and the number of agents k to
interact with per time step. The last parameter can be
diﬀerent for distinct agents depending on the topology of
the actual network.

In order to elucidate the principal properties of the up-
date rule given by Eqs. (1) and (2), we examine in detail
the noiseless interactions between three agents with dif-
ferent characteristic values of a two–dimensional opin-
ion vector (O = 2), namely, a1 = {0.8, 0.2}, a2 =
{0.5, 0.5} and a3 = {0.2, 0.8}. First, a1 with a1 results in
{0.94, 0.06}—interactions between agents with the same
dominant opinion strengthens their belief in this opin-
ion. a1 with a2 yields {0.8, 0.2}—interactions with “un-
decided” agents are ineﬀective in the sense that agents
without dominant opinion are not able to convince an-
other agent. On the other hand, this interaction will
have a substantial eﬀect on the undecided agent, i.e.,
undecided agents are convinced easily. The interaction

A simple mean-ﬁeld solution of the model without
noise can be derived. Suppose a state where all agents
have the same values in their opinion vectors. Thus the
index of the agents can be suppressed, a(i)
n (t) = an(t)
and a(i)
n (t + 1) = an(t + 1), and Eqs. (1) and (2) can be
summarized. In the case of two opinions the equations

The results reveal that the system can reach two dif-
ferent absorbing states. At small values of the control
parameter (maximum noise η), one opinion completely
dominates the system, omax. For a noise η larger than
a certain value, each opinion remains with the same fre-
quency, 1/O. The order parameter D is the frequency of
the agents which have an opinion vector with the same
dominant opinion, being itself dominant in the system.
More precisely:
for each agent we search its strongest
opinion and then count, for each opinion, the number
“n” of agents with this opinion as their dominant one.
The largest value nD, and so the most dominant one of
the system, determines D = nD/N . hDi means, that we
average D over many time steps. This order parameter is
normalized, so that it is unity if all agents have the same
dominant opinion, a state we call the consensus state.
The value 1/O corresponds to an uniform distribution
of opinions. A transition occurs between consensus and
uniform distribution, when hDi goes from 1 to 1/2 in the
case of two opinions (Fig. 1a).

The ﬁxed points of these equations are (a1, a2) =
{(0, 1), (1, 0), (0.5, 0.5)} where the ﬁrst two ones are sta-
ble and the last one is unstable. The solutions for O opin-
ions are: {(1, 0, 0, ...), (0, 1, 0, 0, ...), ..., (0, 0, ..., 0, 1)} with
all an stable. All other solutions have at least one unsta-
ble element of the opinion vector and thus the unstable
element inﬂuences the other ones until an absorbing state
with one opinion totally dominant is reached.

III. RESULTS

A. Annealed interactions

First, we present simulations of the model without
ﬁxed topology. Each time step, a simulation runs over
all agents. For each of them and at each time step,
two new random partners are chosen to interact. We
chose interaction with two other agents (k = 2) in order
to facilitate the comparison of this case with the one of
an one-dimensional chain which will be explained in the
following section. The annealed approach avoids long
term behavior and the distribution of opinions reaches
the stationary state fast. Because the interacting units
are a sampling of the whole system, it is expected that
this annealed approximation should behave similar to a
mean-ﬁeld.

FIG. 4: The size of the largest cluster increases in time until
it reaches the population size N = 1, 000. Here, we see the
results of diﬀerent random initializations of the system on a
chain. The number of opinions is ten, and the noise η = 0.2.

The transition becomes more abrupt for larger pop-
ulation sizes. A transition point characteristic for the
jump from the consensus to the uniform states is located
at ηc ≈ 0.5, increasing with the population size. This
transition seems to be a phase transition of second order.
We carried out ﬁnite size scaling in order to obtain the
critical exponents (Fig. 1b). Near the critical point the
curves coincide using the scaling relations,

with ν ≈ 2.4 ± 0.1, β = 0.15 ± 0.05, and the critical noise

the transition becomes of ﬁrst order for simulations with
an opinion vector of more than two opinion elements.

FIG. 5: Graphical illustration of the temporal behavior of the system on a chain. The color (gray tone) corresponds to the
value of the ﬁrst of the two opinions of the system. The simulations run over 100, 000 time steps, drawing each 1, 000 iterations
a new point on the vertical axis beginning at the bottom. The horizontal axis depicts the location of each agent on the chain,
altogether consisting of 1, 000 agents. The noise η is 0.05 in (a), 0.2 in (b), 0.35 in (c), and 0.45 in (d).

The ﬂuctuations do not increase at the transition point.
Now, the transition from the consensus to the uniform
state depends on the initialization, and is much more
abrupt. If the initialization is random, the system jumps
to the consensus state at lower values of η than in the
case of an initialization with consensus in one opinion. A
transition with a typical hysteresis occurs at lower values
of η if we increase the dimension of the opinion vector.

Note that D gives us the fraction of agents with dom-
inant opinion (omax) but does not contain information
about aomax, the magnitude of the component associated
In Fig. 2d we plot aomax vs. η for the same
to omax.
simulations presented in Fig. 2c. aomax is larger for lower
values of η and below a certain ηc consensus is observed
for both kinds of initializations, only when a large value
of aomax is reached. This is a nice feature of our model:
consensus and resolution emerge together in the system.
That is, the agents can only make up their minds for a
preferred opinion when consensus is achieved through all
the system.

B. One-dimensional topology

If we put the agents on an one-dimensional lattice with
periodic boundary conditions, or, in other words, a chain,
the results become diﬀerent. First, we concentrate on the
case of ten opinions and no noise (η = 0): The system
is now highly dependent on the initial state. A random
initialization of the opinion vectors leads to the situation
depicted in Fig. 3a. The same amount of each opinion
seems present in the system during the evolution. The
system organizes itself by rearranging its opinion vectors
to form local clusters of diﬀerent sizes. In one cluster the
same opinion dominates for all agents. Each agent has a
well pronounced dominance of an opinion (its value being
nearly one), and the interfaces between clusters of diﬀer-
ent dominant opinions are very sharp. These clusters
develop fast after the beginning of the simulation. The
distributions of cluster sizes follows the exponential de-
cay of a Poisson distribution (Fig. 3b). The results with
η = 0 are qualitatively the same for diﬀerent numbers of
opinions, O.

FIG. 6: Histogram of the time steps needed to reach the con-
sensus state. Each curve corresponds to simulations with the
same parameters: 100 agents, 2 opinions, random initializa-
tion. For each value of the noise parameter we carried out
200, 000 runs with diﬀerent random seeds.

Noise (η > 0) leads to a slow increase of one of the
ten opinions with time. The dominant opinion absorbs
more and more of the losing opinions. Fig. 4 illustrates
how the largest cluster of the system temporally evolves
for η = 0.2. As also can be recognized in this ﬁgure,
the time to reach consensus can be really long, even in a
small system of 1, 000 agents.

With non-zero but small noise, the information prop-
agates slowly through the sample. Because of that, the
time to reach the absorbing state is much larger than
in the case of random interactions. Next we consider
a system consisting of 1, 000 agents, which have opin-
ion vectors of two dimensions. The normalization of
Eq. (2) allows us to focus only on the temporal behav-
ior of one of each agent’s opinion without loss of in-
formation. Fig. 5 exhibits this time behavior for the
noises η = 0.05, 0.2, 0.35, 0.45 during the ﬁrst 100, 000
time steps. Each agent’s ﬁrst opinion is depicted by a
color (gray tone) which corresponds to its value, and
evolves beginning at the bottom. At low noise values
stable clusters seem to form. The size of the clusters
becomes smaller with decreasing η. Nevertheless, these
clusters are not stable, and the system reaches the con-
sensus state after a ﬁnite time. For η = 0.05 and η = 0.2
the size of clusters with the second dominant opinion is
larger, indicating that at the end this opinion will con-
trol the system. The larger the size of a cluster the longer
it takes to break it. At values of η larger than η = 0.3,
strong ﬂuctuations control the system, and consensus be-
gins to become unstable. For values around η = 0.3 one
opinion still dominates, and clusters appear and disap-
pear. At larger η the opinions have values around 0.5 for
all agents which do not ﬂuctuate much.

It is interesting to calculate the number of time steps

the system needs to reach its ﬁnal state. In a system of
two opinions we carried out various simulations with the
same value of noise, η, and a population size of N = 100.
Each simulation begins with an initialization of randomly
distributed opinions but a diﬀerent random seed. Fig. 6
shows the distribution of times, needed to reach the con-
sensus state for a system. The distribution decreases
exponentially. The distribution becomes broader with
decreasing values of η, where η = 0 should correspond to
a ﬂat distribution.

As in the case of random interactions, a transition oc-
curs from the consensus state to the one of an uniform
distribution of the opinions. Fig. 7a illustrates the vari-
ation of hDi with η for diﬀerent system sizes. As shown
in Fig 7b, by performing a ﬁnite-size scaling analysis
through Eq. (4), the collapse of all curves is obtained
when we use the critical exponents ν = 2, and β = 2.

FIG. 8: (a)Inﬂuence of the topology of networks on the tran-

transition on two diﬀerent scale-free networks, the Apollo-
nian (solid line) and the Barab´asi-Albert network (triangles)
is similar to the one observed for annealed interactions (plus
signs), and diﬀers from the transition on a regular lattice (cir-
cles). In the three insets we plot the value of the dominant
opinion, aomax vs.
(b) Comparison of the behavior
of aomax(t) on the four networks: Apollonian (solid line),
BA (dotted line), Annealed (dashed-line) and Regular (long
dashed line) for a ﬁxed noise (η = 0.2). One observes that
for this noise, which is below the critical noise, in the regu-
lar network the emergence of consensus takes longer than in
scale-free and annealed interactions, which have similar be-
havior (three upper curves). (c) Near below the transition,
for η = 0.4, we compare the response of the regular and the
Apollonian network. It is observed that for the former there
is an intermittency among consensus D = 1 and aomax = 0.79
and not consensus D = 0.5 and aomax = 0.5. This behavior
is not observed in the complex networks. (d) Above the tran-
sition (η = 0.6) the consensus is broken and the dynamics
of the opinion aomax vs. time behaves similar in regular and
complex networks. All simulation runs are with systems of
124 agents.

C. Complex networks

In this section we compare the behavior of the opinion
model if the agents interact with their k nearest neigh-
bors on diﬀerent networks topologies. We study two dif-
ferent kinds of scale-free networks; i.e. networks with
a power law degree distribution k−α. Those are the

6

Barab´asi-Albert network (BA)[14] and the Apollonian
network [13]. The networks have considerable topolog-
ical diﬀerences, that can be expressed in terms of their
clustering coeﬃcient C. This coeﬃcient is the average
probability that the neighbors of a node are connected
among them. The BA network has a clustering coeﬃ-
cient, C, which depends on the network size as N −1. It
is independent on the degree of the nodes. In contrast,
the Apollonian network has hierarchical structure with
C depending on the degree of the node as a power law
of the degree and its average value is high (C ≈ 0.8) and
independent of the network size N . Both types of scale-
free networks, with and without hierarchical structure,
have shown to be good models for rather diﬀerent kinds
of social interaction networks, from social collaboration
networks [18] to networks of sexual contacts[19].

Further, we show that despite of the structural dif-
ferences of these networks, the formation of consensus
depends mainly on the noise and is independent on the
speciﬁc topology of the scale-free network studied in the
case of two opinions. The transition to consensus as a
function of noise for the two scale-free networks, seems
to belong to the same type of transition as in the case of
annealed interactions. In contrast, we compare the be-
havior of the model with a regular network with k = 6
on a chain (in the previous section we had k = 2), adding
interactions up to the third nearest neighbors. The tran-
sition from consensus to an uniform distribution on the
regular network diﬀers from the transition of complex
networks and annealed case and presents similar behav-
ior as the one reported in previous sections for a chain.

In Fig. 8a we show hDi vs. η for the model on the BA
(triangles), and Apollonian networks (solid line), com-
pared to the result of annealed interactions (plus signs)
and the regular network (circles). The results of the ﬁg-
ure represent the average over 20 realizations on systems
of N = 124 agents and 2 opinions. Near the transition,
the ﬂuctuations on the regular lattice strongly increase,
as opposed to annealed interaction and to BA and Apol-
lonian networks. This is because the system presents an
intermittency near the transition point (η ≈ 0.4). We
observe this intermittency of the dynamics in Fig. 8c,
comparing the value of the dominant opinion aomax vs.
time, for the Apollonian and the regular network with
η = 0.4. Above the critical noise, there is no consen-
sus and the fraction of agents with dominant opinion is
hDi ≈ 1/2. At these values of η, the response of the sys-
tem is similar for scale-free and regular networks, as is
shown in Fig. 8d with η = 0.6.

Above the critical noise there is no way for the agents
to achieve global coordination. In this situation, the dy-
namics is dominated by local interactions, thus the topol-
ogy of the system has little eﬀect on this regime. Be-
low the critical noise, global coordination becomes pos-
sible. However, the low dimensionality of the regular
lattice leads to the intermittent behavior observed in the
panel 8c.

IV. CONCLUSION

Starting from a model based on interactions with a
term of second order, we analyzed its behavior for dif-
ferent topologies:
random, regular and complex ones.
Depending on the control parameter, the noise η, two
diﬀerent absorbing states control the system. Its behav-
ior changes from consensus to an uniform distribution
of opinions. Despite the rather simple approach to take
into account such simple interactions, a rich variety of
results can be reported depending on the dimension of
the opinion vector. The results show that an opinion is
kept (for systems with more than two opinions), and the
parameters need to be adjusted crucially to change the
state (hysteresis). This occurs at diﬀerent dimensions
O of the opinion vector, depending on the topology of
interactions.

The response of the system to approach consensus has
the origin in the model dynamics as opposed to the par-
ticular features of the network. An important charac-
teristic of the transition to consensus is the dimension

associated to the space of agent interactions. The dy-
namical response of the opinion model for both scale-free
networks is similar to the response observed for annealed
interactions and each of these cases represents long range
interactions. In contrast, diﬀerences are reported with a
regular lattice, which has spatial dimension one, associ-
ated to nearest neighbors interactions.

As it was previously observed for the Sznajd model of
opinion formation, for the general model that we present
here, the response of the system in terms of opinion for-
mation is qualitatively the same for a deterministic scale
free network as well as for a random scale free network.
This implies a clear advantage for an analytical treatment
in a similar way as was done for the Sznajd model [20].

League competition is investigated using random processes and scaling techniques. In our model,
a weak team can upset a strong team with a ﬁxed probability. Teams play an equal number of
head-to-head matches and the team with the largest number of wins is declared to be the champion.
The total number of games needed for the best team to win the championship with high certainty,
N 3. This number can be substantially
T , grows as the cube of the number of teams, N , i.e., T
reduced using preliminary rounds where teams play a small number of games and subsequently,
only the top teams advance to the next round. When there are k rounds, the total number of
N γk with
games needed for the best team to emerge as champion, Tk, scales as follows, Tk
−1. For example, γk = 9/5, 27/19, 81/65 for k = 1, 2, 3. These results suggest
γk = [1
an algorithm for how to infer the best team using a schedule that is linear in N . We conclude that
league format is an ineﬀective method of determining the best team, and that sequential elimination
from the bottom up is fair and eﬃcient.

INTRODUCTION

Competition is ubiquitous in physical, biological, so-
ciological, and economical processes. Examples include
ordering kinetics where large domains grow at the ex-
pense of small ones [1, 2], evolution where ﬁtter species
thrive at the expense of weaker species [3], social strati-
ﬁcation where humans vie for social status [4, 5, 6], and
the business world where companies compete for market
share [7, 8].

The world of sports provides an ideal laboratory for
modeling competition because game data are accurate,
abundant, and accessible. Moreover, since sports compe-
titions are typically head-to-head, sports can be viewed
as an interacting particle system, enabling analogies
with physical systems that evolve via binary interac-
tions [9, 10, 11, 12]. For instance, sports nicely demon-
strate that the outcome of a single competition is not
predictable [13, 14]. Over the past century the lower
seeded team had an astounding 44% chance of defeating
a higher seeded team in baseball [14]. The same is true
for other competitions in arts, science, and politics. This
inherent randomness has profound consequences. Even
after a long series of competitions, the best team does
not always ﬁnish ﬁrst.

To understand how randomness aﬀects the outcome of
multiple competitions, we study an idealized system. In
our model league, there are N teams ranked from best
to worst, so that in each match there is a well-deﬁned
favorite and underdog. We assume that the weaker team
can defeat the stronger team with a ﬁxed probability. Us-
ing random walk properties and scaling techniques anal-
ogous to those used in polymer physics [15, 16], we study
the rank of the champion as a function of the number of
teams and the number of games. We ﬁnd that a huge
N 3, is needed to guarantee that the
number games, T
best team becomes the champion.

∼

We suggest that a more eﬃcient strategy to decide
champions is to set up preliminary rounds where a small
number of games is played and based on the outcome
of these games, only the top teams advance to the next
round. In the ﬁnal championship round, M teams play a
suﬃcient number of M 3 games to decide the champion.
Using k carefully constructed preliminary rounds, the re-
quired number of games, Tk, can be reduced signiﬁcantly

II. LEAGUE COMPETITION

Our model league consists of N teams that compete in
head-to-head matches. We assume that each team has
an innate strength and that no two teams are equal. The
teams are ranked from 1 (the best team) to N (the worst
team). This ranking is ﬁxed and does not evolve with
time. The teams play a ﬁxed number of head-to-head
games, and each game produces a winner and a loser. In
our model, the stronger (lower seed) team is considered
to be the favorite and the weaker (higher seed) team is
considered to be the underdog. The outcome of each
match is stochastic: the underdog wins with the upset
probability 0 < q < 1/2 and the favorite wins with the
complementary probability p = 1
q. The team with the
largest number of wins is the champion.

−

Since the better team does not necessarily win a game,
the best team does not necessarily win the championship.
In this study, we address the following questions: How
many games are needed for the best team to ﬁnish ﬁrst?
What is the typical rank of a champion decided by a

relatively small number of games? What is the optimal
way to choose a champion?

We answer these questions using scaling techniques.

Therefore, the probability Pn that this team wins a game
against a randomly chosen opponent is a linear combina-
tion of the probabilities p and q,

The latter varies linearly with rank: it is largest for the
best team, P1 = p, and smallest for the worst team,
PN = q.

Now, suppose that the nth team plays t games, each
against a randomly chosen opponent. The number of
wins it accumulates, wn(t), is a random quantity that
grows as follows

both proportional to the number of games played

The quantities Wn and σn can be used to understand
key features of this system. Let us assume that each team
plays t games against randomly selected opponents and
compare the best team with the nth ranked team. Since
P1 > Pn, the best team accumulates wins at a faster rate,
and after playing suﬃciently many games, the best team
should be ahead. However, since there is a diﬀusive-like

Since the diﬀusion coeﬃcient Dn = Pn(1

dence is tacitly ignored. When these two teams have
a comparable number of wins, they have comparable
chances to ﬁnish ﬁrst. Hence, Eq. (6) yields the char-
acteristic rank of the champion, n∗, as a function of the
number of teams N and the number of games t

Since we are primarily interested in the behavior as a
function of t and N , the dependence on the probability p
is henceforth left implicit. As expected, the champion be-
comes stronger as the number of games increases (recall
that small n represents a stronger team). By substitut-
1 into (7), we deduce that the total number of

This result has signiﬁcant implications. In most sports
leagues, two teams face each other a ﬁxed number of

short.

thereby implying that upset champions are

tournaments produce upset champions with a much

leagues have a much narrower range of outcomes and in
this sense, leagues are more fair than tournaments.

III. PRELIMINARY ROUNDS

With such a large number of games, the ordinary
league format is highly ineﬃcient. How can we devise
a schedule that produces the best team as the champion
with the least number of games? The answer involves
preliminary rounds. In a preliminary round, teams play
a small number of games and only the top teams advance
to the next round.

Let us consider a two stage format. The ﬁrst stage
is a preliminary round where teams play t1 games and
then, the teams are ranked according to the outcome of
N teams advance to the
these games. The top M
≪
ﬁnal round [18], and the rest are eliminated. The ﬁnal
championship round proceeds via a league format with
plenty of games to guarantee that the best team ends up
at the top .

We assume that the number of teams advancing to the

second round grows sub-linearly

N α1 ,

M

(11)

with α1 < 1. Of course, we better not eliminate the
best team. The number of games t1 required for the
top team to ﬁnish no worse than M th place is obtained
N 2/M 2. Since
by substituting n∗
each of the N teams plays t1 games, the total num-
ber of games in the preliminary round is of the order
N 3−2α1 . Directly from (8), the num-
N t1 ∼
ber of games in the ﬁnal round is M 3
N 3α1 . Adding
these two contributions, the total number of games, T1,
is

Consequently, t1 ∼
Thus, it is possible to signiﬁcantly improve upon the
ordinary league format using a two-stage procedure. The
ﬁrst stage is a preliminary round in which each of the N

teams plays t1 ∼

are eliminated. The ﬁrst preliminary round requires N 9/5
games. In the ﬁnal round the remaining teams play in
a league with each of the possible
pairs of teams
playing each other M times. Again the number of games
is N 9/5 so that in total,

ordinary N 3 league play.

Multiple preliminary rounds further reduce the number
of games. Introducing an additional round, there are now
three stages: the ﬁrst preliminary round, the second pre-
liminary round, and the championship round. Out of the
ﬁrst round N α2 teams proceed to the second round and
then, N α1α2 teams proceed to the championship round.
The total number of games T2 is a straightforward gen-
eralization of (12)

N 3−2α2 + N α2(3−2α1) + N 3α1α2.

(15)

T2 ∼

These three terms account respectively for the ﬁrst
round, the second round, and the ﬁnal round. The ﬁrst
term is analogous to the ﬁrst term in (12), and the last
two terms are obtained by replacing N with N α2 in (12).
The total number of games is minimal when all three
terms are of the same magnitude. Comparing the last

Thus, α2 = 15/19 and since α2 > α1, the ﬁrst elimination

These results indicate that it is possible to systemat-
ically reduce the total number of games via successive
preliminary rounds that lead to the ﬁnal championship
round.
In the most general case, there are k prelimi-
nary rounds in addition to the ﬁnal round. The number
of teams advancing to the second round, Mk, grows as

IV. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS

Our scaling analysis is heuristic: we assumed that N is
very large and we ignored numerical constants. To verify
the applicability of our asymptotic results to moderately
sized leagues, we performed numerical simulations with
N teams that play an equal number of t games against
randomly selected opponents. The outcome of each game
is stochastic: with probability p the favorite wins and
with probability q = 1
p, the underdog wins. We present
simulation results for q = 1/4.

The most important theoretical prediction is the rela-
tion (7) between the rank of the winner, the number of
games, and the size of the league. To test this prediction,
we measured the average rank of the winner as a func-
tion of the number of games t, for leagues of various sizes.
In the simulations, it is convenient to shift the rank by
one: the teams are ranked from n = 0 (the best team) to
n = N
1 (the worst team). With this deﬁnition, the av-
erage rank decreases indeﬁnitely with t. The simulations

To validate (8), we simulated leagues with a large

lated three leagues of respective sizes N = 101, N = 102,
and N = 103, and observed that the best team wins
with a frequency of 70%. The champion is among the
top three teams in 98% of the cases (these percentages
are independent of N ). As a reference, in an ordinary
league with a total of N 3 games, the best team also wins
with a likelihood of 70%. Remarkably, even for as little as
N = 10 teams, the one preliminary round format reduces
the number of games by a factor > 10. We conclude that
the scaling results are useful at moderate league size N .

VI. CONCLUSIONS

In summary, we studied dynamics of league competi-
tion with ﬁxed team strength and a ﬁnite upset proba-
bility. We demonstrated that ordinary league play where
all teams play an equal number of games requires a very
large number of games for the best team to win with
certainty. We also showed that a series of preliminary
rounds with a small but suﬃcient number games to suc-
cessively eliminate the weakest teams is a fair and eﬃ-
cient way to identify the champion. We obtained scaling
laws for the number of advancing teams and the num-
ber of games in each preliminary round. Interestingly, it
is possible to determine the best team by having teams
play, on average, only a ﬁnite number of games (inde-
pendent of league size). The optimal size of the ﬁnal

6

championship round scales as the one-third power of the
number of teams.

Empirical validation of these results with real data may
be possible using sports leagues, for example. The chal-
lenge is that the inherent strength of each team is not
known. In professional sports, a team’s budget can serve
as a proxy for its strength. With this deﬁnition, the aver-
age rank of the American baseball world series champion,
over the past 30 years, equals 6. There are however huge
ﬂuctuations: while the top team won 7 times, a team
ranked as low as 26 (2003 Florida Marlins) also won.

With wide ranging applications, including for exam-
ple evolution [20, 21], leadership statistics is a challeng-
ing extreme statistics problem because the record of one

team constrains the records of all other teams. Our scal-
ing approach, based on the record a ﬁxed team, ignores
such correlations. While these correlations do not aﬀect
the scaling laws, they do aﬀect the distribution of out-
comes such as the distribution of the rank of the winner,
and the distribution of the number of games needed for
the best team to take the lead for good. Other inter-
esting questions include the expected number of distinct
leaders, and the number of lead changes as a function of
league size [22, 23].

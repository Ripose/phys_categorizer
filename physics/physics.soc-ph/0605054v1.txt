In this article, we propose a growing network model based on an optimal policy involving both
topological and geographical ingredients.
In this model, at each time step, a new node, having
randomly assigned coordinates in a 1 × 1 square, is added and connected with a previously existing
α
node i which minimizes the quantity r2
i , where ri denotes the geographical distance, ki is the
degree, and α is a free parameter. The degree distribution obeys a power-law form when α = 1, and
an exponential form when α = 0. When α is in the interval (0, 1), the networks exhibit the stretched
exponential distribution. We prove that the average topological distance increases in a logarithmic
scale of network size, indicating the existence of small-world property. Furthermore, we analytically
obtain the geographical edge-length distribution, the total geographical length of all edges, and the
average geographical distance of whole network. Interestingly, we ﬁnd that the total edge-length will
sharply increase when α exceeds the critical point αc = 1, and the average geographical distance has
an upper bound independent to the network size. All the results are obtained analytically, which
agree well with the simulations.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Since the seminal works on the small-world phe-
nomenon by Watts and Strogatz [1] and the scale-free
property by Barab´asi and Albert [2], the studies of com-
plex networks have attracted a lot of interests within the
physics community [3, 4, 5, 6]. Most of previous works fo-
cus on the topological properties (i.e. non-geographical
properties) of networks. In this sense, every edge is of
length 1, and the topological distance between two nodes
is simply deﬁned as the number of edges along the short-
est path connecting them. To ignore the geographical
eﬀects is valid for some networked systems (e.g.
the
food webs [7], the citation networks [8], the metabolic
networks [9], etc.) where the Euclidean coordinates of
nodes and the lengths of edges have no physical meaning.
Besides those non-geographical networks, many real-life
networks, such as the transportation networks [10, 11],
the Internet [12, 13], and the power grids [14, 15], live
in the real space with well-deﬁned node-positions and
edge-lengths. In addition to the topologically preferen-
tial attachment introduced by Barab´asi and Albert [2],
some recent works have demonstrated that the spatially
preferential attachment mechanism also plays major role
in determining the network evolution [16, 17, 18].

Very recently, some authors investigated the spatial
structure of the so-called optimal networks [19, 20]. The
optimal network has given size and optimal linking pat-
tern, which is obtained by a certain global optimization
algorithm (e.g. simulated annealing) with objective func-

tion involving both geographical and topological ingredi-
ents. Their works provided some guidelines in network
design. However, majority of real networks are not ﬁxed,
but grow continuously. Therefore, to study the growing
networks with optimal policy is not only of theoretical
interest, but also of practical signiﬁcance. To ﬁll this
gap, in this paper, we propose a growing network model,
in which, at each time step, one node is added and con-
nected with some existing nodes according to a optimal
policy. The degree distribution, edge length distribution,
and topological as well as geographical distances are ana-
lytically obtained, which agree well with the simulations.

II. MODEL

×

Consider a square of size 1

1 and with open bound-
ary condition. Initially, m points inside the square are
randomly selected and fully connected with each other.
Then, at the tth time step (t > 2), a point inside the
square is randomly selected. Rank each previous nodes
according to the corresponding quantity

2/kα

(1)

ωi =

i (t),

|−→ri − −→rt |
and the node having smallest ω is arranged in the top.
Here each node is labelled by its entering time, −→rt rep-
resents the position of the tth node, ki(t) is the degree
of the ith node at time t, and α
0 is a free parameter.
The newly added node will connect to m existing nodes
that have smallest ω (i.e. in the top of the queue).

In real geographical networks, short links are always
dominant since constructing long links will cost more [21].
On the other hand, to connect to the high-degree nodes
will make the average topological distance over all the

previous nodes to the new one shorter. These two ingre-
dients are embodied by the numerator and denominator
of Eq. (1), respectively. In addition, the weight of these
two ingredients are not equal. For example, the airline
travellers attach importance to the number of legs [11],
the railway travellers and car drivers consider more about
geographical distance [10], and the bus passengers often
simultaneously think of both the two factors [22]. In the
present model, if α = 0, only the geographical ingredi-
ent is taken into account. Contrarily, if α
, the
geographical eﬀect vanishes.

→ ∞

Fig. 1 shows some embodying examples for diﬀerent
value of α. When only the geographical ingredient is con-
sidered (α = 0), most edges are very short and the degree
distribution is very narrow. The average geographical
length of edges becomes longer, and the degree distri-
bution becomes broader in the case of α = 0.5. When
α = 1, the scale-free structure emerges and a few hub
nodes govern the whole network evolution. And for very
large α, the network becomes star-like. Hereinafter, we
will give detailed investigation about both the topological
and geographical properties.

III. DEGREE DISTRIBUTION

For simplify, we concentrate on the case of m = 1. We
also have checked that the value of m, if not too large,
will not aﬀect the main network properties.

At the tth time step, there are t
The square can be divided into t
1 regions such that
if the new node is fallen inside the ith region Si, the
i (t) is minimized, thus the new node
quantity
will attach an edge to the ith node. Since the coordinate
of the new node is randomly selected inside the square,
the probability of connecting with the ith node is equal

to the area of Si. If the positions of nodes are uniformly
distributed, statistically, the area of Si is approximately
proportional to kα
i (t). According to this assumption, by
using the mean-ﬁeld theory [2], the analytic solution of
degree distribution can be obtained. However, when α >
1, most links are connected to one single node (see Fig.
1d), and analytic solution is unavailable. Here we shall
only concentrate on the case of 1 > α

model, reads P (k) = 4t/(k(k + 1)(k + 2)). The above
solution can also be obtained by using the approach of
rate equation proposed by Krapivsky et al. [23].

R

Clearly, the degree distribution obeys a power-law form
at α = 1, and an exponential form at α = 0. When α is
in the interval (0, 1), the networks display the so-called
stretched exponential distribution [24]: For small α, the
distribution is close to an exponential one, while for large
α, it is close to a power-law one. This result is in accor-
dance with the situation of real-life transportation net-
works. If only the geographical ingredient is taken into
account (e.g. road networks [19]), then the degree distri-
bution is very narrow. On the contrary, if the topologi-
cal ingredient plays the major role (e.g. airline networks
[11]), then the scale-free property emerges. When both
the two ingredients work (e.g. bus networks [22]), the de-
gree distribution is intervenient between power-law and
exponential ones.

Fig. 2 shows the simulation results for α = 1 and
α = 0.5. The degree distribution follows a power-law
form when α = 1, which agrees well with the analytic
solution. In the case of α = 0.5, the degree distribution
is more exponential. However, it is remarkably broader
than that of Erd¨os-R´enyi [25] model. Note that, the po-
sitions of all the nodes are not completely uniformly dis-
tributed, which will aﬀect the degree distribution. This

dient plays more important role (i.e. smaller α). There-
fore, although the analytic result for α = 0.5 is in accor-

topological distance of the (t + 1)th node is l(i) + 1 if it is
connected with the ith node. According to the induction

According to the mathematical induction principle, we
have proved that the topological distance between the
ith node and the ﬁrst node, denoted by l(i) could not
exceed the order O(lni). For arbitrary nodes i and j,
clearly, the topological distance between them could not
exceed the sum l(i) + l(j), thus the average topological
distance
of the whole network could not exceed the
order O(lni) either. This topological character is referred
as the small-world eﬀect in the network science [1], and
has been observed in the majority of real networks. Ac-
tually, one is able to prove that the order of l(t) in the
large t limit is equal to lnt (see Appendix A for details).

sition can be easily transferred to prove the inequality
l(t + 1) < M ln(t + 1) under the condition l(i) < M lni

VII. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION

In many real-life transportation networks, the geo-
graphical eﬀect can not be ignored. Some scientists pro-
posed certain global optimal algorithms to see the geo-
graphical eﬀect on the architecture of network [19, 20].
Since many networks grow continuously, besides, we pro-
posed a growing network model based on an optimal
policy involving both topological and geographical in-
gredients. We found that the degree distribution will
be broader when the topological ingredient plays more
important role (i.e. larger α), and when α exceeds a crit-
ical point αc = 1, a ﬁnite fraction of nodes will connected
with a single hub node and the geographical eﬀect will
be insigniﬁcant. This critical point can also be observed
when detecting the total geographical edge-length R(t)
in the large t limit. We obtained the analytical solutions
about degree distribution, edge-length distribution, and
topological as well as geographical distances, which agree
well with the simulations.

The analytical approach is only valid for the tree struc-
ture with m = 1, however, we have checked that all the
results will not change qualitatively if m is not too large
compared with the network size. Some analytical meth-
ods proposed here are simple but useful, and may be
applied to solve some other related problems about the
statistical properties of complex networks. For example,
a similar but much simpler approach, comparing with
that is used in section 4, can also be used to estimate the
average topological distance for some other geographical
networks [26, 27].

Finally, it is worthwhile to emphasize that, the geo-
graphical eﬀects should also be taken into account when
investigating the eﬃciency (e.g. the traﬃc throughput
[28]) of transportation networks. Very recently, some au-
thors start to consider the geographical eﬀects on dy-
namical processes, such as epidemic spreading [29] and

6

cascading [30], upon scale-free networks. We hope this
work can further enlighten the readers on this interesting
subject.

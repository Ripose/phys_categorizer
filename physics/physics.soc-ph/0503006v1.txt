Summary. A phenomenon of the ﬁnancial log-periodicity is discussed and
the characteristics that amplify its predictive potential are elaborated. The
principal one is self-similarity that obeys across all the time scales. Further-
more the same preferred scaling factor appears to provide the most consistent
description of the market dynamics on all these scales both in the bull as
well as in the bear market phases and is common to all the major markets.
These ingredients set very desirable and useful constraints for understanding
the past market behavior as well as in designing forecasting scenarios. One
novel speculative example of a more detailed S&P500 development until 2010
is presented.

Key words. Financial physics, critical phenomena, log-periodicity

The concept of ﬁnancial log-periodicity is based on the appealing assumption
that the ﬁnancial dynamics is governed by phenomena analogous to criticality
in the statistical physics sense (Sornette et al. 1996, Feigenbaum and Freund
1996). Criticality implies a scale invariance which, for a properly deﬁned func-
tion F (x) characterizing the system, means that

A constant γ describes how the properties of the system change when it is
rescaled by the factor λ. The general solution to this equation reads:

F (λx) = γF (x).

F (x) = xαP (ln(x)/ ln(λ)),

where the ﬁrst term represents a standard power-law that is characteristic of
continuous scale-invariance with the critical exponent α = ln(γ)/ ln(λ) and
P denotes a periodic function of period one. This general solution can be in-
terpreted in terms of discrete scale invariance. It is due to the second term
that the conventional dominating scaling acquires a correction that is periodic
in ln(x) and may account for the zig-zag character of ﬁnancial dynamics. It
demands however that if x = |T − Tc|, where T denotes the ordinary time
labeling the original price time series, represents a distance to the critical
point Tc, the resulting spacing between the corresponding consecutive repeat-
able structures at xn seen in the linear scale follow a geometric contraction
according to the relation (xn+1 − xn)/(xn+2 − xn+1) = λ. The critical points
correspond to the accumulation of such oscillations and, in the context of the
ﬁnancial dynamics, it is this eﬀect that potentially can be used for prediction.
An extremely important related element, for a proper interpretation and
handling of the ﬁnancial patterns as well as for consistency of the the-
ory, is that such log-periodic oscillations manifest their action self-similarly
through various time scales (Dro˙zd˙z et al. 1999). This applies both to the log-
periodically accelerating bubble market phase as well as to the log-periodically
decelerating anti-bubble phase. Furthermore, more and more evidence is col-
lected that the preferred scaling factor λ ≈ 2 and is common to all the scales
and markets (Dro˙zd˙z et al. 2003). These two elements, self-similarity and
universality of the λ, set very valuable and in fact crucial constraints on pos-
sible forms of the analytic representations of the market trends and oscillation
patterns, including the future ones as well.

A speciﬁc form of the periodic function P in Eq. 2 is as yet not provided by
any ﬁrst principles which opens room for certain, seemingly mathematically
unrigorous assignments of patterns. This, on the other hand, allows to correct
for frequent market ’imprecisions’ when relating its real behavior versus the
theory. Very helpful in this respect is the requirement of self-similarity which
greatly clariﬁes the signiﬁcance of a given pattern and allows to determine
on what time scale it operates. Since in the corresponding methodology the
oscillation structure carries the most relevant information about the market
dynamics, for transparency of this presentation, we use the ﬁrst term of its
Fourier expansion,

P (ln(x)/ ln(λ)) = A + B cos(

ln(x) + φ).

2π

This implies that ω = 2π/ ln(λ). Already such a simple parametrization al-
lows to properly reﬂect the contraction of oscillations, especially on the larger
time scales. On the smaller time scales just replacing the cosine by its modu-
lus often, even quantitatively in addition, describes departures of the market
amplitude from its average trend.

One particularly relevant and special, for several reasons, example is shown
in Fig. 1. The upper panel (a) illustrates a nearly optimal log-periodic rep-
resentation of the S&P500 data over the most extended time-period of the

recorded stock market activity as dated since 1800. As already pointed out
(Dro˙zd˙z et al. 2003) this development signals in around 2025 a transition of
the S&P500 to a globally declining phase as measured in the contemporary
terms. The magniﬁcation of the small rectangle covering the period 1997-2002
is displayed in the lower panel (b) of the same Fig. 1. It thus illustrates the

4

nature of the stock market evolution on a much smaller time scale of resolu-
tion. An impressive log-periodicity with the same λ = 2 on both sides of the
transition date (September 1, 2000) can be seen.

The next stock market top from the perspective of the largest time scale
(Fig. 1a) can be estimated to occur in around the years 2010-2011. In the spirit
of the log-periodicity its neighborhood is to be accompanied by the smaller
time scale oscillations - similar in character to those in Fig. 1b. Of course,
when going far away from those large scale transition points such pure log-
periodic structures - representative to the one level lower time scale - must get
dissolved. A particularly interesting related question then is what character-
istics are to govern the stock market dynamics in the transition period when
going from 2000 to 2010. The most natural and straightforward way is to view
this process as schematically is indicated in Fig. 2. This whole period is thus
covered by the two main components represented by the thin lines and the
market dynamics is driven by the superposition of of these two components
whose phases, slopes and weights are adjusted such that the overall global
market trend up to now is reproduced.

Fig. 2. A hypothetical log-periodic scenario, represented by the thick solid line, for
the S&P500 development until 2010. This solid line is obtained by summing up the
two λ = 2 components (thin lines): log-periodically decelerating since 1.9.2000 and
log-periodically accelerating toward 1.9.2010.

In this scenario, close to the two large-scale transition points (Septem-
ber 2000 and, as provisionally estimated here based on Fig. 1a, September
2010) the market is driven, as needed, essentially by the single log-periodic
components, decelerating and accelerating one, correspondingly. More com-
plicated is the situation in the middle of this time interval where the two
components contribute comparably. Most interestingly, it indicates that the

period of the stock market stagnation may extend even into the year 2008,
before it seriously starts rising. It also demonstrates a possible mechanism
that generates modulation structures responsible for the apparent higher or-
der corrections (Johansen and Sornette 1999) to Eq. (3). The changes in the
frequency relations observed in the transition period between the bear and
the bull market phases originate here from the interference between the two
components, both of the simple form as prescribed by Eq. (3) and with the
same λ = 2. Of course, similar eﬀects of interference may occur on the whole
hierarchy of diﬀerent time scales.

There is one more element that from time to time takes place in the ﬁnan-
cial dynamics and whose identiﬁcation appears relevant for a proper interpre-
tation of the ﬁnancial patterns with the same universal value of the preferred
scaling factor λ. This is the phenomenon of a ”super-bubble” (Dro˙zd˙z et al.
2003) which is a local bubble, itself evolving log-periodically, superimposed
on top of a long-term bubble. Two such spectacular examples are provided by
the Nasdaq in the ﬁrst quarter of 2000 and by the gold price in the beginning
of 1981 (Dro˙zd˙z et al. 2003).

periodic λ = 2 representation in terms of Eq. (3).

In connection with this second case it is important to remember that the
same value of λ as for the stock market turns out appropriate. That such
its value may be characteristic to the whole commodities market as well, is
shown in Fig. 3 which displays the New York traded oil futures versus the best
log-periodic (λ = 2) representation. In fact, this scenario has been drawn by
the authors on September 15, 2004, insisting on using λ = 2, even though one
local minimum (in the beginning of 2004) in the corresponding sequence did

6

not look very convincing. Designed this way it was indicating a continuation
of the increase until the end of October and then a more serious reverse of the
trend. Subsequent development of the oil futures provides further arguments
in favor of this way of handling the ﬁnancial log-periodicity.

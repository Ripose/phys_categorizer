Abstract

We consider a standard susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model
to study behaviors of steady states of epidemic spreading in small-
world networks. Using analytical methods and large scale simulations,
we recover the usual epidemic behavior with a critical threshold λc be-
low which infectious diseases die out. Whereas for the spreading rate
λ far above λc, it was found that the density of infected individuals ρ
as a function of λ has the property ρ ≈ F (K)(ln λ − ln λc).

Keywords: networks and genealogical trees, diseases, phase transi-
tions.

Complex networks have attracted an increasing interest recently. The
main reason is that they play an important role in the understanding of
complex behaviors in real world networks,[1, 2, 3] including the structure
of language,[4, 5] scientiﬁc collaboration networks,[6] the Internet[7, 8] and
World Wide Web,[9, 10] power grids,[11] food webs,[12, 13] chemical reaction
networks,[14] metabolic[15] and protein networks,[16] etc.
In the study of
complex networks, an analysis of the structures can give important informa-
tion about the underlying processes responsible for the observed macroscopic
behavior, such as small-world[17] and scale-free[18] networks. In particular,
social networks have two characters. First, they show “clustering”, meaning

1

that two of your friends are far more likely also to be friends of each other
than two people chosen from the population at random. Second, they exhibit
the “small-world eﬀect”, namely, that any two people can establish contact
by going through only a short chain of intermediate acquaintances. These
two properties appear contradictory because the ﬁrst is a typical property of
low-dimensional lattices but not of random graphs or other high-dimensional
lattices, while the second is typically of random graphs, but not of low-
dimensional lattices. D.J. Watts and S.H. Strogatz suggested a new small-
world model[17] recently which interpolates between low-dimensional lattices
and random graphs and displays the both properties. In the model, a small-
world network is constructed as follows: starting with a ring of N vertices,
each connected to its 2K nearest neighbors by undirected edges, and then
each local link is visited once with the rewiring probability p it is removed
and reconnected to a randomly chosen node. Duplicate edges are forbid-
den. After the whole sweep of the entire network, a small-world network is
constructed with an average connectivity hki = 2K. The WS networks has
been widely studied because it constitutes an interesting attempt to translate
complex topologies of social, economic, and physical networks into a simple
model.

Although topological properties of complex networks have been studied in
detail,[18, 19, 20, 21] a natural question arises, that is the dynamical prop-
erties which result from diﬀerent networks. A good example is to inspect
complex features of epidemic spreading since the characterization and un-
derstanding of epidemic dynamics in these networks could probably provide
us immediate applications to a large number of problems, such as computer
virus infections, distribution of wealth, transmission of public opinion, etc.
Recent papers[22, 23, 24, 25] have given some valuable insights of that: for
small-world networks, there is a critical threshold below which an infection
with a spreading rate dies out; on the contrary, for scale-free networks, even
an infection with a low spreading rate will prevalence the entire population.
In the present paper we consider a standard SIS model[26] in small-world
networks, in which each node represents an individual of the population and
edges represent physical interactions through which an infection spreads. Ac-
cording to the SIS model, an individual is described by a single dynamical
variable adopting one of the two stages: susceptible and infected. A suscep-
tible individual at time t − 1 will pass to the infected state with the rate
ν at time t if it is connected to one or more infected individuals. Infected
individuals at time t − 1 will pass to the susceptible state with the rate δ

2

at time t, deﬁning an eﬀective spreading rate λ = ν/δ. We can still keep
generality by setting δ = 1. Individuals run stochastically through the cycle
susceptible → infected → susceptible, hence the model got its name. In the
SIS model, an important observable is the prevalence ρ, which is the time
average of the fraction of infected individuals reached after a transient from
the initial condition. Given a network, the only parameter of the model is the
spreading rate λ. The information on the global spreading of the infection is
contained in the function ρ(λ).

Small-world networks have very small diameters which mean the presence
of disordered long range interactions.
In this case, the networks are very
homogeneous and quite reasonable that the mean-ﬁeld (MF) method is valid.
By neglecting the density correlations among the diﬀerent nodes and ignoring
all higher order corrections in ρ(t), the time evolution equation of the SIS
model can be written as[27]

˙ρ(t) = −ρ(t) + λhkiρ(t)(1 − ρ(t)).

(1)

In the equation, the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side (rhs) considers infected
nodes become healthy with unit rate and the second term on the rhs repre-
sents the average density of newly infected nodes generated by susceptible
nodes. By imposing the stationary condition ∂tρ(t) = 0, one can obtain the
equation

ρ[−1 + λhki(1 − ρ)] = 0

(2)

for the steady state density of infected nodes ρ. The equation deﬁnes an
epidemic threshold

λc = hki−1.
In other words, if the value of λ is above the threshold, λ > λc, the infection
spreads and becomes endemic with a ﬁnite stationary density ρ. Below it,
λ ≤ λc, the infection dies out. In Euclidean lattices, J. Marro and R. Dick-
man have concluded the order parameter behavior of critical phenomena is
ρ ∼ (λ − λc)β with β ≤ 1 in the region λ ∼ λc,[27] which uncovers the linear
property in the critical dimension. R. Pastor-Satorras and A. Vespignani
also recovered this property in small-world networks with the rewiring prob-
ability p = 1.0[24] recently; it is worth noticing that in the extreme case the
generated network is an entirely random network with a restriction which
leads to a large cluster.

(3)

In order to compare with the analytical prediction we have performed
large scale simulations of the SIS model with parallel updating in the WS

3

network with the rewiring probability p = 0.1. The both properties of social
networks are well presented by the network in this case. The size of the
network is N = 106. The number of the initially infected nodes is 10 percent
of the size of the network. Simulations were implemented on the network
averaging over 20 diﬀerent realizations. After an initial transient regime,
the systems stabilize in a steady state with a constant average density of

with various types of the scale of axis for λ is very closed to λc. The linear
property of the order parameter of Euclidean lattices, ρ ∼ (λ − λc)β, is well
presented by the log-log plot of Fig. 1(d) which gives the parameter value
β = 0.98 ± 0.04. However, it is obvious that the four plots almost show
the same shapes. Consequently the following acceptable predictions for Fig.
1(a-d) are respectively given by

Considering the Taylor expansion ln λ ≈ λ
Eq. (4b) can be rewritten as

λc + ln λc − 1 at one order near λc,

One can also derive the equation

from the Eq. (4d) in the same way. So, based on the numerical simulations
closed to λc, a analogous linear relationship between the infected density and
the spreading rate, ρ ≈ aλ + b, was extracted from the simple approximation
of series expansions (see Eq. (4a), Eq. (5), Eq. (4c), and Eq. (6) correspond-
ing to Fig. 1(a)-(d), respectively). Therefore, we will calculate the tendency
of ρ for λ > λc next.

As explicitly stated in Ref.

[27], Eq. (1) is derived in the case of small
values of ρ. So it is meaningful only in the region λ ∼ λc and could not
determine the behavior for λ far above λc, i.e., the MF prediction of Euclidean
lattices is invalid in this region. In this condition, numerical methods are
naturally adopted to ﬁnd the behavior of the prevalence for λ > λc. In Fig.

4

2 we perform the numerical results as far as λ = 0.4. The linear property
of Eq. (4d) was presented excellent agreement with the numerical results.
Note that the constant parameters a4 and b4 in Eq. (4d) should be taken
count of the initial setting value of the average connectivity 2K. More exact
conclusion for the nature of Fig. 2, which presented the whole behavior at
λ > λc, should be given by

ρ ≈ F (K)(ln λ − ln λc),

if λ > λc.

(7)

To complete our study of the steady states of the SIS model in small-world
networks, we compute the coeﬃcient F (K) in Eq. (7). In Fig. 3 we plot
the coeﬃcient F (K) as a function of K. The linear behavior of the log-log
plot predicts the power law, F = K −α. Numerical results give the parameter
value α ≈ 0.98.

In summary, we have analytically and numerically studied the steady
states of epidemic spreading in small-world networks. In the region λ ∼ λc,
we recover the MF results of Euclidean lattices, ρ ∼ (λ − λc)β. But when
spreading rates become far above the threshold, λ > λc, the MF method can
not work normally and the numerical method is adopted. It was found that
the behavior of order parameter has the property ρ ≈ F (K)(ln λ − ln λc). In
the present work, we just consider the dynamics on the WS network with
the rewiring probability p = 0.1. However, for other values of p, the results
are qualitatively and quantitatively the same as that we get.

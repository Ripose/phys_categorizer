Abstract. A phenomenological investigation of the endogenous and exogenous dynamics in the ﬂuctuations
of capital ﬂuxes is investigated on the Chinese stock market using mean-variance analysis, ﬂuctuation
analysis and their generalizations to higher orders. Non-universal dynamics have been found not only
in α exponents diﬀerent from the universal value 1/2 and 1 but also in the distributions of the ratios
ηi = σexo
. Both the scaling exponent α of ﬂuctuations and the Hurst exponent Hi increase in
logarithmic form with the time scale ∆t and the mean traded value per minute hfii, respectively. We ﬁnd
that the scaling exponent αendo of the endogenous ﬂuctuations is found to be independent of the time
scale, while the exponent of exogenous ﬂuctuations αexo = 1. Multiscaling and multifractal features are
observed in the data as well. However, the inhomogeneous impact model is not veriﬁed.

1 Introduction

Complex systems are ubiquitous in natural and social sci-
ences. The behavior of complex system as a whole is usu-
ally richer than the sum of its parts and it is lost if one
looks at the constituents separately. Complex systems evolve
in a self-adaptive manner and self-organize to form emer-
gent behaviors due to the interactions among the con-
stituents of a complex system at the microscopic level. The
study of complexity has been witnessed in almost all disci-
plines of social and natural sciences (see, for instance, the
special issue of Nature on this topic in 2001 [1]). Most com-
plex systems in social and natural sciences exhibit sudden
phase transitions accompanied with extreme events [2,3,4,
5]. All sorts of extreme events including natural disasters
(such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, hurricanes and
tornadoes, catastrophic events of environmental degrada-
tion), accidental crises (such as industrial production ac-
cidents, nuclear leakage, reactor explosion, ﬁre), public
health aﬀairs (such as diseases and epidemics), and so-
cial security events (such as crashes in the stock mar-
ket, economic drawdowns on national and global scales,
traﬃc gridlock, social unrest leading to large-scale strikes
and upheaval) are called catastrophes. Extreme events or

catastrophes will impact the dynamics of complex systems
heavily.

The catastrophes in the dynamics of complex systems
can be triggered by either endogenous or exogenous shocks.
Endogenous shocks result from the cumulation of many
small ﬂuctuations inside the system in a self-organizing
[3,6]. In contrast, exogenous shocks stem from extreme
external changes outside the system. Theoretically, exoge-
nous shocks are unpredictable only with information of
the system, while endogenous shocks are predictable in
some sense since the system might exhibit characteristic
patterns in its self-organizing evolution to crisis. In addi-
tion, the responses of the system to endogenous and exoge-
nous shocks unveil usually diﬀerent dynamics behaviors,
which enables us to classify diﬀerent dynamics classes of
shocks and complex systems. The dynamical behaviors of
response are subject to the long memory eﬀects in com-
plex systems [6,7]. Along this line, the endogenous and
exogenous dynamics of many systems have studied, such
as Internet download shocks [8,9,10], book sale shocks [11,
12,13], social shocks [14], ﬁnancial volatility shocks [15],
ﬁnancial crashes [16], and volatility shocks in models of
ﬁnancial markets [17,18,19].

The constituents of a complex system and their inter-
actions form a complex network. The topological prop-
erties of complex networks have attracted a great deal
of attention in recent years, which play a crucial role in

the understanding of how the components interact with
each other to drive the collective dynamics of complex
systems [20,21,22,23]. From the network point of view,
another framework have been developed by de Menezes
and Barab´asi to describe simultaneously the behaviors of
thousands of elements and their connections between the
average ﬂuxes and ﬂuctuations [24,25,26]. The ﬂuxes fi
recorded at individual nodes in transportation networks
(such as the number of bytes on Internet, the stream ﬂow
in river networks, the number of cars on highways) are
found to possess a power-law relationship between the
standard deviation and the mean of the ﬂuxes [24,25,26],

market quotes disposed to all traders in every six to eight
seconds, which are diﬀerent from the ultrahigh frequency
data reconstructed from the limit-order book [42]. Because
of the reform of non-tradable shares in the Chinese stock
market, some companies are not continuously traded in
this period, these companies are excluded from our anal-
ysis. We are left for analysis with 533 companies listed on
the SZSE and 821 companies on the SHSE, 1354 in to-
tal. Our results are compared with that for the American
stock market and several discrepancies are unveiled.

2 Mean-variance analysis

which is actually the mean-variance analysis [27]. There
are two universal classes of dynamics characterized by the
ﬂuctuation exponent α. The ﬂuctuation exponent of a sys-
tem is α = 0.5 if it is driven completely by endogenous
forces (such as Internet and microchip) and α = 1 if it
is driven fully by exogenous forces (such as world wide
webs, river networks and highways) [24,25,26]. Other ap-
plications include external ﬂuctuations in gene expression
time series from yeast and human organisms with α = 1
[28] and endogenous ﬂuctuations of the variation with age
of the relative heterogeneity of health with α = 0.5 [29].
However, non-universal scaling exponents diﬀerent from 1
and 0.5 have also been found, for instance in the stock
markets [30,31,32], the gene network of yeast [33], and
traﬃc network [34]. One is able to separate the endogenous
and exogenous components of a signal [25,26]. Further-
more, Eisler and Kert´esz show that the non-universal scal-
ing behavior of traded values of stocks listed on the NYSE
and NASDAQ is closely related to the non-universal tem-
poral correlations in individual signals [35,36,37,38,39].

Several models are proposed to understand the origins
of the observed dynamical scaling laws. Models of random
diﬀusion on complex networks with ﬁxed number of walk-
ers and variational number of walkers are able to interpret
the two universal classes [24]. We note that the random
diﬀusion model with varying number of walkers is also able
to explain non-universal dynamics with 0.5 < α < 1 [24].
Other random walk models include the inhomogeneous
impact model where the activity f equals to the number
of the visitors at a node multiplied by their impact [40]
and that based on the hypothesis that the arrival and de-
parture of “packets” follow exponential distributions and
the processing capability of nodes is either unlimited or
ﬁnite [34].

In this paper, we perform a detailed phenomenological
scaling analysis on the Chinese stock market1, following
the aforementioned framework. We employ a nice tick-
by-tick data of the stocks for all companies listed on the
Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE) and the Shanghai Stock
Exchange (SHSE) from 04-Jan-2006 to 30-Jun-2006. We
note that, the tick-by-tick data are recorded based on the

explanation of the associated trading rules can be found in
Refs. [41, 42]. See also Ref. [43].

Obviously, all the 1354 companies have connections of
sorts forming an intangible network. Each node of the
underlying network stands for a company and a link be-
tween any two nodes is drawn if the two corresponding
companies have some kind of tie. However, it is not our
concern here on how these companies are connected and
what the topology of the underlying network is. Natu-
rally, we may choose the cash ﬂows of each company as
the ﬂuxes through the corresponding node [30,35,36]. We
denote Vi(τ ) the trade volume and pi(τ ) the price for the
trade at recording time τ , where i represents the i-th stock.
For a given time interval (t − ∆t, t], the ﬂux of company i
at time t can be calculated as follows,

f ∆t
i

(t) =

pi(τ )Vi(τ ) ,

Xτ ∈(t−∆t,t]

Therefore, f ∆t
(t) is the total turnover of stock i in the
time interval (t − ∆t, t]. We can re-sample the data by
choosing ∆t = 1, 2, 3, · · · , n min and t = m∆t, where
m = 1, 2, · · · . For a chosen value of ∆t, f ∆t
(m∆t) can be
denoted as f ∆t

(m) for simplicity.

To quantify the coupling between the average ﬂux hf ∆t
i
and the ﬂux dispersion σ∆t
of the capital ﬂow of individ-
ual companies, the dispersion σ∆t
is plotted in Figure 1
as a function of the mean ﬂux hf ∆t
i for two diﬀerent time
scales ∆t = 10 min and ∆t = 240 min. As shown in Fig-
ure 1(a), there is an evident power-law scaling between
σ10
i and hf 10
i i over three orders of magnitude with a dy-
namical exponent α10 = 0.899 ± 0.007. Similarly, σ240
and f 240
illustrated in Figure 1(b) follow a power-law
behavior spanning over three orders of magnitude with
α240 = 0.927 ± 0.008.

These α values are diﬀerent from α = 0.5 (endogenous
driven systems) and α = 1 (exogenous driven systems) [24,
25,26]. Kert´esz and Eisler point out system with inhomo-
geneous impact will induce scaling exponents 0.5 < α < 1
[31,32]. However, the corresponding α value of the Chinese
stock market is much larger than that of the American
market at the same time scale. For instance, α ≈ 0.88 for
the Chinese stock market while α ≈ 0.73 for the NYSE for
∆t = 2 min [31]. The results imply that there are much
more exogenous driving forces in the Chinese stock market
than in the American market.

Figure 2 shows the dependence of the scaling exponent
α∆t with respect to the time scale ∆t. We ﬁnd that α∆t

increases linearly with the logarithm of the time scale ∆t,

α∆t = α∗ + γα log ∆t .

(3)

A linear least squares regression gives the slope γα =
0.0101 ± 0.0002. According to the Eﬃcient Market Hy-
pothesis [44,45], the longer the information (news) spreads
on the market, the more it is interpreted and digested by
the market. Therefore, the market is more sensitive to
exogenous driving forces than endogenous forces at large
time scale. That’s the reason why α∆t increases with ∆t.
For comparison, we also calculated the exponent α for the
shuﬄed data. As is shown in Figure 2, the exponent α
remains constant with respect to the time scale ∆t, indi-
cating that the correlations in the traded value series act
at least as a key factor causing the equation (3).

The macroscopic properties of complex systems may stem
from the endogenous interactions between the elements in
systems or the exogenous shocks from the environment or
both. It is important to distinguish the endogenous and
exogenous components of the system’s dynamic behav-
iors. de Menezes and coworkers have proposed a technique
to separate endogenous and exogenous dynamics of com-
plex systems [25,26]. The observed dynamics of the capital
ﬂuxes are caused by the interplay between the endogenous
and exogenous driving forces so that the observable can
be written as the sum of two components:

fi(t) = f exo

i

(t) + f endo

(t),

i

(4)

i

where fi(t) stands for the total capital ﬂow, f exo
(t) repre-
sents the component due to exogenous driving forces, and
f endo
i

(t) is endogenous component.

In the framework of de Menezes et al. [25,26], f exo
(t)
is the product of the proportional coeﬃcient Ai and the
N
total ﬂux of the system at time t (i.e.
i=1 fi(t)). The
coeﬃcient Ai is the ratio of the total cash ﬂow of company
i during the period under investigation to the total trading
capital ﬂux of all the companies at the same time interval.
Mathematically, we have

Following the aforementioned approach, we are able to
separate the exogenous and endogenous ﬂux components
from the total capital ﬂows. We performed the analysis
for diﬀerent values of ∆t ranging from 2 min to 4500 min.
The time evolution of the total capital ﬂux with ∆t = 2
min of a typical stock and its resultant endogenous and
exogenous components are illustrated in Figure 3. The re-
sults are qualitatively the same for other stocks and other
time scales. It is interesting to observe that the endoge-
nous component f endo
(t) exhibits high-frequency ﬂuctua-
tions while the exogenous component f exo
(t) shows low-
frequency patterns. Speciﬁcally, f exo
(t) has sound intra-
day patterns with a period of half a day, which is rem-
iniscent of the similar intraday pattern reported for the
bid-ask spread of stocks in the Chinese market [42]. We
note that the Chinese stock market operates in the morn-
ing and in the afternoon with a closure from 11:30 to 13:00
in the noon.

the endogenous exponent is αendo = 0.878 ± 0.008. Panel (b)
is for ∆t = 240 min (one trading day), where αexo = 0.999 ±

Fig. 3. Separating the endogenous and exogenous contribu-
tions from the total capital ﬂuxes. Panel (a) is the total capital
ﬂux, panel (b) is the endogenous component, and panel (c) is
the exogenous component. There are evident intraday patterns
in the exogenous signal.

The power-law scaling (1) also holds for the two com-
ponents extracted. The scaling behaviors of the endoge-
nous and exogenous ﬂuctuations of the stocks traded in
the the SHSE (open squares) and the SZSE (open cir-
cles) are presented in Figure 4(a) for time scale ∆t = 10
min and in Figure 4(b) for time scale ∆t = 240 min. All
the scaling ranges span over more than three orders of
magnitude. For ∆t = 10 min, the exogenous scaling expo-
nent is αexo = 1 and the endogenous exponent is αendo =
0.878 ± 0.008. For ∆t = 240 min (one trading day), we
have αexo = 0.999 ± 0.0004 and αendo = 0.884 ± 0.009.
It is interesting to notice that the scaling relations of the
exogenous components are less dispersed.

Figure 5 shows the dependence of the endogenous ex-
ponents αendo and the exogenous exponents αexo with
respect to the time scale ∆t. We ﬁnd that, all the ex-
ogenous ﬂuctuations σexo have the same scaling exponent
αexo ≈ 1 at diﬀerent time scales, while the scaling expo-
nent of the endogenous ﬂuctuations σendo almost remains
constant with minor variations along the time scale ∆t:
αendo ≈ 0.86 ∼ 0.89. The fact that αendo is independent
of ∆t is completely diﬀerent from the resulting endoge-
nous exponents reported for the NYSE case, where the
endogenous exponent varies with the time scale [30]. The
underlying mechanism of such discrepancy between the
American market and the Chinese market is unclear. Pos-
sible causes include the absence of market orders, no short
positions, the maximum percentage of ﬂuctuation (10%)
in each day, and the t + 1 trading mechanism in the Chi-
nese stock market on the one hand and the hybrid trading

Utilizing the separated exogenous and endogenous sig-
nals, we can obtain the ratio of the exogenous dispersion
to the endogenous dispersions as follows

(8)

When ηi ≫ 1, the system is driven by exogenous factors.
In contrast, the system is dominated by endogenous dy-
namics when ηi ≪ 1. The empirical probability density
distributions p(η) for two typical time scales are shown in
Figure 6 using histograms. One can see that the ratio ηi
has unimodal distribution. In addition, it is clearly visi-
ble that the p(η) distributions observed at diﬀerent time
scales are diﬀerent, indicating the dynamics of the system
evolves with time scale ∆t. For time scale ∆t = 10 min,
the distribution is centered roughly around η = 0.5 and
no value of η is larger than 1, as suggested by Figure 6(a).

This means that the dynamics at small time scale is dom-
inated by endogenous driving forces. When the time scale
increases to ∆ = 240 min, the peak of the ratio distribu-
tion moves to around η = 0.8 and some values of η become
larger than 1 as shown in Figure 6(b), indicating that ex-
ogenous ﬂuctuations have more impact on the system’s
dynamics.

We investigated the ratio η at diﬀerent time scales. For
each time scale, we calculated the mean hηi of all the ra-
tios of the 1354 stocks. Figure 7 presents the mean hηi of
the ratios ηi = σexo
as a function of time scale ∆t.
The hηi function exhibits a clear upwards trend, increasing
with ∆t from small values far less than 1 to large values
much greater than 1. This trend hallmarks the crossover
of relative competition of the endogenous dynamics and
the exogenous dynamics of the Chinese stock market. This
phenomenon conﬁrms that the exogenous diving forces be-
come stronger with the increasing of the time interval ∆t
in stock markets [30]. When ∆t ≥ 1800 min (about 7.5
trading days), hηi > 1, suggesting that the exogenous ﬂuc-
tuations overcome the endogenous ones and become the
dominating factor eﬀecting the system’s behaviors.

The temporal correlations have been extensively discussed
in many physical and ﬁnancial time series [46,47,48]. There
are many methods proposed for this purpose [49,50], such
as spectral analysis, rescaled range analysis [51,52,53,54,
55,56], ﬂuctuation analysis [57], detrended ﬂuctuation anal-
ysis (DFA) [58,59,60], wavelet transform module maxima
(WTMM) [61,62,63,64,65], and detrended moving aver-
age [66,67,68,69,70], to list a few. We adopt the ﬂuctua-
tion analysis to extract the Hurst exponent [35,36,37,38,
39],

The Hurst exponent Hi > 0.5 means that the time series
is correlated, Hi < 0.5 means that the time series is anti-
correlated, and for Hi = 0.5, it is uncorrelated.

(cid:11)

Figure 8 shows the ﬂuctuation analysis on the capital
ﬂux time series of two stocks: Wanke (Code 000002, cir-
cles) from the SZSE and Shanggang (Code 600018, squares)
from the SHSE. The solid lines are the linear ﬁts to the
data, which give the Hurst exponents Hi = 0.863 ± 0.003
for Wanke and Hi = 0.843±0.007 for Shanggang. The fact
that the Hurst exponents of the two companies are much
lager than 0.5 suggests that there is long-range memory
in the traded values of individual companies. For compar-
ison, we reshuﬄed the two data sets and performed the
same ﬂuctuation analysis. we obtain that Hi = 0.512 ±
0.005 for the shuﬄed data of Wanke and Hi = 0.524 ±
0.007 for the shuﬄed data of Shanggang, which are close
to H = 0.5. We stress that, according to Figure 8, there is
no evident crossover of scaling regimes in the Chinese mar-
ket. In contrast, there is a clear crossover behavior from
uncorrelated regime when ∆t < t× to strongly correlated

Z.-Q. Jiang, L. Guo, & W.-X. Zhou: Endogenous and exogenous dynamics in the ﬂuctuations of capital ﬂuxes

The Hurst exponents for all the 1354 stocks are esti-
mated. In Figure 9, we present as open circles the resulting
Hurst exponents for diﬀerent values of hfii after (approxi-
mately) logarithmic binning. One ﬁnds that the Hurst ex-
ponents of the traded values increase with the logarithm
of mean traded value per minute and is approximately
linear

Hi = H ∗ + γH loghfii ,

(10)

where the slope γH = 0.013 ± 0.001. This linear relation-
ship between Hi and loghfii was ﬁrst reported by Eilser
and Kert´esz for the NYSE and NASDAQ but with larger
slopes: γH = 0.06 for the NYSE and γH = 0.05 for the
NASDAQ [35,36,37,38,39]. As a reference, we ﬁnd that
the shuﬄed data give an uncorrelated Hurst exponent
Hi ≈ 0.5 independent of the traded values. A linear re-
gression gives that γH = 0.003 ± 0.002 ≈ 0. Since fi is a
measure of the size or capitalization of a company listed
on stock exchanges, the relation (10) implies that the trad-
ing activities of larger companies exhibit stronger correla-
tions. Moreover, the Hurst exponents for all the Chinese
stock investigated are signiﬁcantly larger than H = 0.5,
while that in the American market are close to H = 0.5
for small companies [35,36,37,38,39].

5 Multiscaling and Multifractal analysis

The mean-variance analysis in equation (1) can be gen-
eralized to higher orders by utilizing the q-order central
moments of the capital ﬂuxes [30],

σq
i =

(f ∆t
i

(t) − hf ∆t

(t)i)q

i

∼ hfiiqα(q) .

(12)

(cid:11)
(cid:10)
where q is a superscript in the term σq
i , not a power. When
i = (σi)2. For q < 0, equa-
q = 2, one recovers that σ2
tion (12) will enlarge the inﬂuences of the small ﬂuctua-
tions and reduce the eﬀect of the large ﬂuctuations, and
vice versa.

The total and endogenous signals have been investi-
gated through equation (12), and the power-law relations
between the q-th order central moments of the signals and
the mean total activities of the same component have been
found as well. Figure 10 shows the multiscaling exponents
α(q). It is found that α(q) also strongly depend on the
time interval ∆t according to Figure 10. There are sev-
eral diﬀerences between our results and that for the NYSE
stocks [30]. First, the α(q) function for the Chinese market
is larger than that of the NYSE market for same q on aver-
age. This is maybe due to the fact that the Chinese market
is more inﬂuenced by exogenous forces. Second, consider
negative values of q. For ∆t = 10 min, αtot > αendo in
the Chinese market while αtot < αendo in the NYSE mar-
ket. For ∆t being a whole trading day, αtot < αendo in
the Chinese market, while αtot > αendo in the NYSE mar-
ket. Third, the diﬀerence between αtot and αendo is much
larger in the Chinese market than in the NYSE market.

There is an intriguing connection between the mean-

This relation is well veriﬁed by the American stock market
data [35]. Our analysis in this work for the Chinese stock
market gives further support to it. The evidence from the
American and the China’s stock market are summarized
in Table 1.

Similarly, one can extend the ﬂuctuation analysis in

equation (9) to higher orders as follows [30],

σq

which enables us to understand the multifractal nature
of in the dynamics of the market. The relationship be-

tween the exponent ζ(q) and the generalized Hurst expo-
nent H(q) can be described as follows,

ζi(q) = qHi(q) .

(14)

When q = 2, Hi = H(2) is the Hurst exponent discussed
in Section 4.

In order to have better statistics, we divided the 1354
stocks into 3 groups according to their average turnover
hf i: 103 RMB/min < hf i ≤ 104 RMB/min, 104 RMB/min
< hf i ≤ 105 RMB/min, and 105 RMB/min < hf i. Note
that 103 RMB/min < hf i < 107 RMB/min for all stocks.
The multifractal analysis is performed upon each indi-
vidual group of stocks rather than individual stocks. The
scaling of σq is illustrated in Figure 11 for q = −1, q = 2,
q = 5, and q = 8. We can observe that there exist crossover
regimes when the value of q is large. Such crossover phe-
nomena disappear for small values of q. This feature is
again diﬀerent from the NYSE case where crossover regimes
are observed for all q investigated [38]. In the Chinese case,
the crossover regime occurs with ∆t = 40 ∼ 240 min (one
trading day).

6 Trading activities scaling with capitalization

Following the work of Zumbach [71] and Eisler and Kert´etz’s
[31,32,36], we investigate the scaling relationship between
capitalization M , which ranges from 4.23 × 108 to 6.33 ×

The mean value per trade V versus the capitalization
M is plotted in Figure 13(a), showing a signiﬁcant power
law scaling. The solid line is the best ﬁt to the data for
the whole regime, which gives a slope of 0.510 ± 0.015.
Figure 13(b) shows the dependence of the mean number
of trades per minute N with respect to the capitalization
M . Least squares ﬁts are performed for 6.3 × 108 < M ≤

8

Z.-Q. Jiang, L. Guo, & W.-X. Zhou: Endogenous and exogenous dynamics in the ﬂuctuations of capital ﬂuxes

1.6 × 1010 and M > 1.6 × 1010 respectively, which give
two exponents 0.424 ± 0.034 and 0.242 ± 0.067. The mean
turnover per minute f scales as a power law with respect to
the mean capitalization M , as is suggested in Figure 13(c).
The power law relation is spanned over three orders orders
of magnitude, with a scaling exponent 0.819±0.027. These
three plots indicate that the trade activities increase with
the capitalization.

We further plot the mean volume per trade V varying
with mean number of trades per minute N in Figure 13(d).
Again a power law behavior for N > 1 trades/min is ob-
served,

hVii = hNiiβ ,
with β = 0.802 ± 0.075. This behavior is also found in
the FTSE-100 stocks with β ≈ 1 [71], in the NYSE stocks
with β = 0.57 ± 0.09 [32,35,36], and in the NASDAQ
stocks with β = 0.22 ± 0.04 [35]. According to the “inho-
mogeneous impact” model, the exponent β is related to
the scaling exponent α as is expressed as follows [40,35]

(15)

α =

1 +

1
2

(cid:18)

β
1 + β

.

(cid:19)

(16)

Substituting β = 0.802 into equation (16), we obtain α =
0.723, which is much smaller than the actual value. This
discrepancy might be due to the fact that β is only found
for larger stocks while α is obtained for all the stocks,
and/or the inhomogeneous impact model, from which equa-
tion (16) is deduced, is too simpliﬁed for stock markets
[37]. Indeed, we ﬁnd that the power-law scaling between
hN i and hM i is not unambiguous. Suppose that hV i ∼
hM iβ1 and hN i ∼ hM iβ2 . It follows immediately that
hV i ∼ hN iβ1/β2 such that β = β1/β2. This equality does
not hold either in the Chinese stock market.

on the Chinese stock market provides further evidence to
the phenomenological observation that the Hurst expo-
nent Hi increases logarithmically with the mean capital
ﬂux hfii. The empirical rule that γα = γH is veriﬁed.

We have also performed multiscaling analysis and mul-
tifractal analysis, as natural generalizations of the mean-
variance analysis and the ﬂuctuation analysis. The Chi-
nese stock market exhibits multiscaling behavior and mul-
tifractal features. However, the multiscaling behavior and
multifractal nature of the capital ﬂuxes in the Chinese
stock market are diﬀerent in several aspects from that in
the American market. The main diﬀerence is that crossover
regime in the scalings is absent for small values of q in the
Chinese market.

In order to test the inhomogeneous impact model, the
relationships among various measures of trading activi-
ties and capitalizations have been studied in the paper.
A clearly power law behavior is found between the mean
value per trade and the capitalization, as well as the mean
capital ﬂux and the capitalization. However, the interpre-
tational power of the inhomogeneous impact model upon
the Chinese stock market is not conﬁrmed. Therefore, the
underlying mechanism of the empirical observations is still
open.

7 Conclusion

We have investigated the endogenous and exogenous dy-
namics of 1354 stocks traded in the Chinese stock mar-
ket. These companies and the capital ﬂuxes (proxied by
traded values per unit time) among them are considered
as a complex network. A non-universal scaling exponent
α of ﬂuctuations diﬀerent from 1/2 and 1 is found with
mean-variance analysis of the ﬂuxes of diﬀerent stocks.
The scaling exponents at diﬀerent time scales of the Chi-
nese stocks are much larger than that of the NYSE stocks,
suggesting that the Chinese market is inﬂuenced more
heavily by the exogenous driving forces than the Amer-
ican market. The scaling exponent α increases linearly as
the logarithm of time scale. The increasing of α also indi-
cates that, for short time scale, the dynamics of the stock
markets are dominated by endogenous ﬂuctuations, while
the exogenous ﬂuctuations overcome the endogenous ones
for large time scales. The ﬂuxes signals can be separated
into endogenous and exogenous components. Both com-
ponents exhibit nice ﬂuctuation scalings whose exponents
αendo and αexo are independent of the time scale. The long
memory existing in the capital ﬂux time series is investi-
gated by applying the ﬂuctuation analysis. Our analysis

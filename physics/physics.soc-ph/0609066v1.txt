Abstract. The electricity market is a very peculiar market due to the large variety
of phenomena that can aﬀect the spot price. However, this market still shows
many typical features of other speculative (commodity) markets like, for instance,
data clustering and mean reversion. We apply the diﬀusion entropy analysis (DEA)
to the Nordic spot electricity market (Nord Pool). We study the waiting time
statistics between consecutive spot price spikes and ﬁnd it to show anomalous scaling
characterized by a decaying power-law. The exponent observed in data follows a quite
robust relationship with the one implied by the DEA analysis. We also in terms of the
DEA revisit topics like clustering, mean-reversion and periodicities. We ﬁnally propose
a GARCH inspired model but for the price itself. Models in the context of stochastic
volatility processes appear under this scope to have a feasible description.

1. Introduction

During the last years, there has been an increasing number of contributions from the
physics community to the study of economic systems. Energy spot prices, that result
from the deregulation of the power sector, are no exception. Weron and Przybylowicz [1]
and Weron [2] deal with the Hurst exponent (or R/S) analysis [3], the detrended
ﬂuctuation analysis (DFA) [4] and periodogram regression methods. These techniques
were used to verify and quantify a claim already stated by ﬁnancial mathematics:
electricity spot prices are mean reverting [5, 6]. This means that they suﬀer a strong
restoring force driving the price toward a certain normal (“fundamental”) level. Using
the language of physics, one says that prices are anti-persistent, or equivalently, that
the price increments are negatively correlated.

Recently, also the Average Wavelet Coeﬃcient (AWC) method [7] has been applied
to spot prices [8]. This method shows its potential in particular when dealing with multi-
scale time series. Due to its separation of scale property, the presence of one scaling
regime covering a given time range is not hampered by the presence of another one. This
is not always the case for many other method, like the DFA, where one scaling behavior
can “spill-over” to the next one and even fully destroy the scaling property of the latter
one [8]. In terms of power markets, this is highly relevant since the statistical behavior
of the price on an intra-day scale is mainly determined by the consumption patterns,
and does not (on this scale) show the characteristic mean reversion character that can
be observed on the day-to-day scale, and above [8]. The lack of possibility in separating
the various scaling regimes, with the technique used, was the main motivation for e.g.
Refs. [1, 2] analyzing mean daily data, which show only one scaling region, instead of
the original hourly data.

the Hurst exponent,

All the analyzing techniques mentioned above relay on the scaling of some kind
of ﬂuctuation measure, say, the standard deviation or variance, as function of the
window size. Such approaches will only measure the correct correlation scaling exponent,
i.e.
if the underlying time series is consistent with Gaussian
statistics [9]. This is for instance the case for the celebrated fractional Brownian
the associated exponent will

partly receive contributions from the correlations as well as the non-Gaussian character,
making it diﬃcult (or impossible) to separate the two [9]. This latter situation is faced
in e.g. ordinary L´evy walks and in its fractional equivalent [10]. Recently, a method
was proposed that in a reliable way can determine and separate the contribution to
the scaling from both correlations and non-Gaussian statistics. This method is based
on the thermodynamics of the time series and known as the diﬀusion entropy analysis
(DEA) [11, 12].

In this paper we apply the DEA for the study of the electricity spot prices from
the Nordic Power exchange (Nord Pool). One of our main aims is to investigate the
statistics of the waiting times between consecutive spot price spikes of deregulated

It is here meant that the tails of the distribution are fatter than those of the Gaussian distribution.

electricity markets, and to uncover if they show anomalous non-Poissonian statistics.
The DEA is specially suited for intermittent signals, i.e., for time series where bursts
of activity are separated from periods of quiescent and regular behavior. The technique
has been designed to study the time distribution of some markers (or events) deﬁned
along the time series and thus discover whether these events satisfy the independence
condition [11, 12]. Other objectives are the study of the antipersitency behaviour in
data via the DEA technique, the observation of existing periodicities in data in many
diﬀerent ways and ﬁnally the proposal of a GARCH model showing properties similar
to those of real data.

This paper is organized as follows. We start in Sec. 2 by brieﬂy discussing the
spot market and the data set to be analyzed in this work. Then we brieﬂy review the
DEA technique (Sec. 3). Section 4 studies the statistics of the most important price
movements and infer some properties on the inter-event peak probability. Section 5
presents the results obtained by the DEA technique on tick-by-tick spot data and
without ﬁltering the most relevant price changes. Furthermore, we propose in Sec. 6
a GARCH model [13, 14, 15, 16, 17] for the spot electricity price and try to obtain
consistent entropies for the tick-by-tick data and the spike ﬁltering. Conclusions are left
for Sec. 7.

2. Nord Pool — the Nordic power exchange

It was
The Nordic commodity market for electricity is known as Nord Pool [18].
established in 1992 as a consequence of the Norwegian energy act of 1991 that formally
paved the way for the deregulation of the electricity sector of that country. At this time it
was a Norwegian market, but in 1996 and 1998 Sweden and Finland joined, respectively.
With the dawn of the new millennium (2000), Denmark decided to become member as
well.

Nord Pool was the world’s ﬁrst international power exchange.

In this market,
participants from outside the Nordic region are allowed to participate on equal terms
with “local” participants. To participate in the spot market it is required that the
participants must have an access to a grid connection enabling them to deliver or take
out power from the main grid. For this reason, the spot market is often also called the
physical market. As for today, the physical market has a few hundreds of participants.
More than one third of the total power consumption in the Nordic region is traded in
this market, and the fraction has steadily been increasing since the inception of the
exchange in the early 1990s. In addition to the physical market, there is also a ﬁnancial
market. Here, power derivatives, like forwards, futures, and options are being traded.
This market presently has about four hundred participants. For each of these two
markets, about ten nationalities are being represented among the market participants.
Nord Pool is an auction based market place where one trades power contracts for
physical delivery within the next day. It is known as a spot market. However, in a strict
sense this notion is not precise since formally it is a day-ahead (24-hours) forward market.

Figure 1. The Nord Pool system spot price from May, 1992 till the end of 2004.
Several (seasonal, weekly, and daily) periodicities can be observed in this data set
below the spiky randomness. The inset shows the price variations over a (randomly
chosen) weekly period.

What is traded are one-hour-long physical power contacts, and the minimum contract
size is 0.1MWh. By noon (12:00 hours) every day, the market participants submit their
(bid and ask) oﬀers (including prices and volumes) to the market administrator (Nord
Pool). The oﬀers are submitted for each of the individual 24 hours of the next day
starting at 1:00 hours. After the submission deadline (for the next day), Nord Pool
proceeds by preparing (for ever hour) cumulative volume distributions (purchase and
sale curves) vs. price (p) for both bid (VB(p)) and ask (VA(p)) oﬀers. Since there in the
electricity market must be a balance between production and consumption, the so-called
system (spot) price, P (t), for that particular hour (t) is determined as the price where
VA(P ) = VB(P ). This is called the market cross, or equilibrium point. Trading based on
this method is called equilibrium trading, auction trading or simultaneous price setting.
If the data do not deﬁne an equilibrium point, no transactions will take place for that
hour, and no system spot price will therefore be determined. So far, to our knowledge,
this has never happened at Nord Pool.

After having determined the system price, P (t), for a given next-day hour, Nord
Pool looks for potential bottlenecks (grid congestions) in the power transmission grid
that might result from this system price. If no bottlenecks are found, the system price

Entropy of the Nordic electricity market

will represent the spot price for the whole Nord Pool area for that given hour. On the
other hand, if potential grid congestions may result from the bidding, so-called area
(spot) prices, that are diﬀerent from the system price, will have to be created. The idea
behind the introduction of area prices is to adjust electricity prices within a geographical
area in order to favor local trading to such a degree that the limited capacity of the
transmission grid is not exceeded. How the area prices are being determined within
Nord Pool diﬀers between, say, Sweden and Norway, and we will not discuss it further
here (see e.g. Ref. [18] for details).

In this work, we will analyze the hourly Nord Pool system spot prices for the
period from (Monday) May 4th, 1992 till the end of Friday December 31st, 2004; in
total 110,987 data points (Fig. 1). In Fig. 2 we present the corresponding normalized
hourly returns (to be deﬁned in Eq. (6) below). The reader should notice that high levels
of return are possible, and typical, for electricity markets. From Fig. 1 one should also
observe that the price process shows several periodicities. Those are mainly attributed
to consumption patterns and are daily, weekly and seasonal in character. They have
been reported and studied previously by several research groups [8, 13, 19, 20, 21]
Superimposed onto this deterministic periodic trend, is a random component showing
strong variability with pronounced spikes and data clustering. The DEA technique
allows us to deal with this randomness by somewhat ignoring the periodic signal.

3. The Diﬀusion Entropy Analysis

The DEA technique is a statistical method for measuring scaling exponents of time
series by utilizing their thermodynamical properties [11, 12]. This is achieved by (i)
converting the time series into some kind of probability density function (pdf), p(x, t),
where the variable x is related to the ﬂuctuating time series and t denotes the time (or
time interval), and (ii) therefrom calculating the related Shannon (information) entropy
S(t) (to be deﬁned below), from which the scaling properties (if any) of the pdf can be
deduced (cf. Eqs. (1) and (3) below).

Various pdf’s of the form p(x, t), obtained from the underlying time series, can be
used together with the DEA technique. For instance, p(x, t) can be the probability of
being at position x at (diﬀusion) time t given that one was at x = 0 at time t = 0, or x
may be a “marker” related to the number of events (like values of the time-series being
above a given threshold etc.) occurring within a time interval of length t. Having said
that, it should be mentioned that generally x should be a zero-mean variable in order to
avoid artifacts in the application of the DEA [11, 12]. We will in the preceding section
describe in more details how one may construct a suitable pdf to be used in the DEA.
Under the assumption that the time series is stationary and scale invariant, one

has that the pdf can be written as

p(x, t) =

1

where δ denotes the so-called scaling exponent (that one wants to determine), and F is

markets.

the Shannon entropy, that in general is deﬁned as

will take on the form

S(t) = A + δ ln t,

(2)

(3)

where A is given by an expression similar to Eq. (2), but with F (y) substituted for
p(x, t). This last transition is easily demonstrated by substituting Eq. (1) into Eq. (2)
and making a change of variable to y = x/tδ.

The important lesson that should be taken from Eq. (3) is that the scaling exponent,
δ, can be obtained as the slope of the entropy vs. ln t curve. This is a reliable method
[9, 11, 12] for measuring the scaling exponent of the probability density (1).

4. Spikes and data clustering

One of the most pronounced features of the electricity spot price process of Fig. 1 is its
spiky nature. Within one, or only a few hours, the spot price can increased manifold.

Month of the year

Figure 3. The frequency distributions of the 100 largest hourly return events vs.
month of year and hour of the day (inset) based on the data depicted in Fig. 2. This
result clearly indicates that the dramatic price changes are not evenly distributed in
time, but instead occur during periods of high consumption.

One of the most extreme example of such a situation occurred on February 5, 2001, when
the spot price reached an all-time-high of 1951.76 NOK/MWh. Three hours earlier, the
spot price had been at about 200 NOK/MWh, a more “normal” level for that time of
year.

The dramatic price variations take place during periods of high consumption,
which for the Nordic area means during the winter season as illustrated by Fig. 3.
One way to explain the appearance of these dramatic price changes is by the so-
called stacking or inventory models [22]: Extra demand for electric power is normally
ﬁlled by the cheapest available energy source. During low consumption periods, the
daily consumption proﬁles, say, will not inﬂuence the price level in any dramatic way,
since there is plenty of base energy generation capacity available. However, when the
consumption already is high, only a minor increase in the demand can have dramatic
consequences for the electricity prices. The higher the demand, the more costly will
it typically be to produce an extra unit of energy, and the more sensitivity will the
price of electric power be to minor changes in the consumption.
If one during such
high-consumption periods experiences loss of less costly generating capacity, e.g. due to
technical problems, extreme situations like the one reported above can be experienced.

Entropy of the Nordic electricity market

8

This sensitivity of the spot price to the level of consumption implies seasonal volatility
clustering with typical low and high volatility periods during the summer and winter
seasons, respectively [19].

The fact that the extreme price spikes are more likely to occur during the winter
season than during the remaining parts the year, has the immediate consequence that
time intervals between (consecutive) spikes are not expected to constitute a Poisson
process. Hence, the time intervals are expected to scale anomalously according to
Feller [23], and hence the scaling exponent will be diﬀerent from 1/2. This waiting
time statistic (between spikes) has previously been studied in e.g. Ref. [9] for solar
ﬂares or earthquakes. It is worth mentioning that although the presence of seasonalities
in spike statistics is quite evident looking at Fig. 3, this does not mean that the spike
events follow a somewhat deterministic rule. As we will show later, time between spikes
τ appears to be described by a power law probability distribution. The periodicities
aﬀect the statistics of very particular values of τ but not the whole probability density
function.

It has in the past been demonstrated [12] that if the “spike” events are independent
and the time interval between them distributed (at least asymptotically) according to
a power law of the form (β > 0)

φ(τ )

1/τ β,

∼

then an analytic relationship between the β and the scaling exponent δ do exist. For
instance, if one constructs an auxiliary process by introducing steps, say, of magnitude
1, whenever the originally set has absolute returns larger than a given threshold (called
a marker below), the relationship reads [12]

to being similar. This is in sharp contrast to, say, stock markets where the two types of returns are
approximately equal in most cases.

One now wants to estimate (count) the number of markers, ˜yt(T ), over a time interval

If we vary the value of t along the interval [T, N∆t], where N is the total number of
data points of the analyzed sequence. From the knowledge of yt(T ), one can now readily
calculate the probability density function p(y, T ) for the moving counter.

At this point we apply the DEA technique [11, 12]. For each time-window of size T ,
one calculates the probability density function of yt, that is: we get p(y, T ) for several
T ’s. The related (Shannon) entropy, S(T ), is then deﬁned in accordance with Eq. (2).
In Fig. 4 we present the behavior of the Nord Pool entropy (using the marker deﬁned
in Eq. (7)) for diﬀerent values of threshold r0. It is observed that the entropy, S(T ),
scales in accordance with Eq. (3), and that the scaling exponent is found to be around
δspikes = 0.91 for all thresholds (solid line in Fig. 4). See Table 1 for further details on
the ﬁtting procedure.

It is interesting to notice that a similar value (within the error bars) for the scaling
exponent has previously been reported for the activity of the US Dollar–Deutsche
Mark futures market (using tick-by-tick data) [24] as well as for daily index data from
the Dow Jones Industrial Average [25]. Hence, the Nordic power market has similar
entropy growth to these two markets. Furthermore, all these data sets have comparable
clustering.

As was alluded to in the introduction to this section, the DEA technique aims at
measuring the inhomogeneity of the distribution of the number of events (as deﬁned by
a marker) over a ﬁxed period of time T , and to obtain the related scaling exponent δ.
An alternative (indirect) approach to obtaining the scaling exponent is to measure the
tail exponent β of the waiting time distribution φ(τ ), and apply relation (5) in order to
obtaining the scaling exponent (under the stated assumptions).

Figure 5 depicts the pdf of waiting times between two consecutive spikes, φ(τ ), for
diﬀerent choices of the threshold r0. It is mostly consistent with a decaying power-law
of the form (5). There seems to be a slight dependence of the waiting time exponent β

One notices that the two methods — the direct via the diﬀusion entropy, and the
indirect determination from the spike waiting time distribution — are consistent within
the error-bars.

5. Mean reversion and consumption patterns

There is in the literature wide consensus on the fact that electricity prices are
stationary in the sense of suﬀering a reverting force driving price towards a normal
level [1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 20, 21, 22, 26]. This level is most often time dependent due to marked
consumption pattern in electricity prices caused by human social activity, and climatic
factors like temperatures (see e.,g. Fig. 3). We will now for consistency address the
mean reverting character of the Nordic spot electricity prices, but now using the DEA
technique. Previously, using the AWC techniques, the so called Hurst exponent, H,
characterizing this property, has been measured to be about 0.4 [8], a similar value also
found for the Californian electricity market [1].

For preparing for the use of the DEA for the measurement of the Hurst exponent,

we deﬁne simply the “marker” being equal to the hourly returns, that is

ξ(t) = ln(P (t)/P (t

∆t)) = r∆t(t).

where one in the last transition has used the deﬁnition of the return (6).

Figure 6 presents the (Shannon) entropy (2) of the moving counter ξ(t) = r∆t(t).
It is observed that the stationary state is reached after about 5, 000 hours which
corresponds to almost seven months. The signal will diﬀuse anomalously until it feels
that the motion of r∆t(t) is constrained by the reverting force. After this threshold, the
entropy S(T ) remains constant and the asymptotic scaling will be δ = 0 (cf. Eq. (3))
and the signal loses its memory.

According to Fig. 6 there also exists a transient state for shorter times than
T = 5, 000 hours. In this regime, the DEA detects the presence of daily and weekly
periodicities but it seems to be insensitive to seasonalities. The analysis, excluding the
periodicities, also allows a ﬁt like the one given by Eq. (3), that is

Sﬁt = A + δreturn ln T,

where in this case δreturn equals the Hurst exponent H use to the hourly returns being
used as markers. From Fig. 6 it is observed that the DEA calculated entropy can be
well ﬁtted in time by the Hurst exponent

HDEA = δreturn = 0.411

for the range between 100 and 6,000 hours. This result fully coincides with the Hurst
exponent measured previously with the AWC method [8].
If the Hurst exponent
H = δreturn was equal to 1/2 we would talk about a (ordinary) diﬀusion process
with a standard deviation growing like √T . Therefore, ﬁnding a value smaller than
1/2 for the Hurst exponent H = δreturn means that the process is antipersistent or
anticorrelated [23].

Going further into the issue of periodicities, we now again explore the distribution
of spikes distance τ for diﬀerent thresholds. We display in Fig. 7 the complementary
cumulative probability of this random variable. Compared to probability density plotted
at Fig. 5 we note that the complementary cumulative distribution function of the spikes
distance is greatly distorted by the presence of periodicities in the underlying data which
breaks a possible power law collapse for several decades. This is mainly due to the gap
in eight hours and daily periodicities while weekly eﬀects does not aﬀect very much the
cumulative curve. These distortions are consistent with the periodicities detected by
the DEA technique. It is again diﬃcult to see the seasonal eﬀects but clearly detect the
rest of periodicities.

6. A GARCH type model

We have seen that the spike statistics for the electricity prices is very similar to that of
the Dow Jones index and also to the peak statistics of the US Dollar–Deutsche Mark

futures market [24, 25]. They both have the same data clustering. The analogy leads us
to search for good candidates for price models for electricity in a similar way to as was
done successfully in Refs. [24, 25]. Volatility clustering and mean reversion are among
the essential characteristics of the volatility and of the market activity. Henceforth, our
survey focuses on existing volatility models.

A possible new attempt is to propose a GARCH model [16] for the spot price. We

suggest the following model for the system spot price P (t):

Figure. 6 shows that this GARCH model produces results for the diﬀusion entropy that
are consistent with real data. Speciﬁcally, the transient period resulting from the model
time series has the same exponent and the stationary state is approached simultaneously
with the real electricity return time series. Moreover, if Eq. (14) is rewritten in terms

we can observe that the reverting force has a characteristic time scale ˆτ = 1/(1

is directly related to ν and brings us the value ˆτ = 1, 667 hours (more than 2 months)
which is of the same order of the time required for real data to arrive at the stationary
state. The ratio k/(1
ν) represents the normal level that prices are driven toward.
In case, one would like to include the consumption patterns in the model one should
replace k by a periodic signal. Finally, the χ value sets the magnitude of the ﬂuctuations.
Having a big χ means having wild ﬂuctuations of price.

7. Conclusions

By applying the DEA technique we have shown that the entropy of the Nordic electricity
spot prices grows with the size of the time window in a similar way to the volatility and
the market activity as diﬀerent as the Dow-Jones and the US Dollar–Deutsche mark
0.9 and they have a
futures. The DEA scaling parameter has the similar value δspikes
comparable clustering.

We have also shown that the distribution of waiting times of the electricity price
1/τ β given by Eq. (4) and that the corresponding power-law exponent
scales as φ(τ )
β is related to the DEA parameter δspikes = 0.91
0.01 as anticipated by the DEA –
see Eq. (5) and Fig. 5. The relationship derived in Ref. [12] is obtained under the
hypothesis that spikes are uncorrelated. This hypothesis might hold true or not but in
any case we have found that the relationship between β and δspikes is still applicable in
the Nord Pool case.

±

We have also obtained a Hurst exponent (δreturn = 0.412

0.002) with the DEA
technique which is coincident with the one derived by previous studies and using diﬀerent
techniques. The resulting quantity implies an antipersistent behaviour of electricity
prices. Moreover, we have been able to detect, for hourly prices, a characteristic time
scale around 5, 000 hours in which the system reaches the stationary state.

±

Due to the several similarities in statistical properties with ﬁnancial markets,
a GARCH model was proposed and investigated for the spot electricity prices.
In
particular, it was shown that the diﬀusion entropy of such a theoretical GARCH model
followed surprisingly closely the entropy that was obtained for the Nord Pool system
spot prices.

We ﬁnally mention that although the DEA seems to detect daily and/or weekly
periodicities in the analyzed data, a more thorough investigation is required to settle
this issue. Eﬀorts are currently undertaken to address this topic.

Core-periphery organization of complex networks

Petter Holme

Department of Physics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, U.S.A.

Networks may, or may not, be wired to have a core that is both itself densely connected and central in terms
of graph distance. In this study we propose a coeﬃcient to measure if the network has such a clear-cut core-
periphery dichotomy. We measure this coeﬃcient for a number of real-world and model networks and ﬁnd
that diﬀerent classes of networks have their characteristic values. For example do geographical networks have
a strong core-periphery structure, while the core-periphery structure of social networks (despite their positive
degree-degree correlations) is rather weak. We proceed to study radial statistics of the core, i.e. properties of the
n-neighborhoods of the core vertices for increasing n. We ﬁnd that almost all networks have unexpectedly many
edges within n-neighborhoods at a certain distance from the core suggesting an eﬀective radius for non-trivial
network processes.

I. INTRODUCTION

measuring radial statistics.

All systems consisting of pairwise-interacting entities can
be modeled as networks. This makes the study of complex
networks one of the most general and interdisciplinary areas
of statistical physics (2; 12; 33). One of the most impor-
tant gains of the recent wave of statistical network studies is
the quantiﬁcation of large-scale network topology (10; 33).
Now, with the use one just a few words and numbers, one
can state the essential characteristics of a huge network—
characteristics that also say something about how dynami-
cal systems conﬁned to the network will behave. A possi-
ble large-scale design principle is that one part of the net-
work constitutes a densely connected core that also is cen-
tral in terms of network distance, and the rest of the network
forms a periphery. In, for example, a network of airline con-
nections you would most certainly pass such a core-airport on
any many-ﬂight itinerary. It is known that a broad degree dis-
tribution can create a core having these properties (9). In this
paper we address the question if there is a tendency for such
a structure in the actual wiring of the network. I.e., if one as-
sumes degree to be, to a large extent, an intrinsic property of
the vertices, then is the network organized with a distinct core-
periphery structure or not? To give a quantitative answer to
this question our ﬁrst step is to ﬁnd a core with the above men-
tioned properties—being highly-interconnected and having a
high closeness centrality (41) (the inverse average distance be-
tween a vertex in the core and an arbitrary vertex). Once such
a subgraph is identiﬁed we calculate its closeness centrality
relative to the graph as a whole, and subtract the correspond-
ing quantity for the ensemble of random graphs with the same
set of degrees as the original network (cf. Ref. (29)). If the re-
sulting coeﬃcient is positive the network shows a pronounced
core-periphery structure. Once the core and periphery are dis-
tinguished one may proceed to investigate their structure. We
look at the statistical properties of the n-neighborhoods (the
set of vertices on distance n) of the core vertices. By such ra-
dial statistics we can draw conclusions for the respective func-
tion of the core and periphery. This paper starts by deﬁning
the core-periphery coeﬃcient and measure it for real-world
networks of numerous types, then proceeds by discussing and

II. MEASURING THE CORE-PERIPHERY STRUCTURE

In this paper we assume the network to be represented as
a graph G = (V, E) with a set V of N vertices and a set E
of M undirected and unweighted edges. (It is straightforward
to generalize our analysis to weighted networks.) Since our
analysis requires the network to be connected we will hence-
forth identify G with the largest connected component of the
network (in all mentioned cases this component will consti-
tute almost the entire network). We also remove self-edges
and multiple edges.

A. Rationale and deﬁnition of the core-periphery coefﬁcient

The notion of network centrality is a very broad and many
measures have been proposed to capture diﬀerent aspects of
the concept (8). One of the simplest quantities is the closeness
centrality (41)

CC(i) =

of a vertex i, where d(i, j) is the distance between i and j (the
smallest number of edges on a path from i to j). The closeness
of a vertex is thus the reciprocal average shortest distance to
the other vertices of V. This deﬁnition is straightforwardly
extended to a subset U of vertices

CC(U) =

hd(i, j)i j∈V\{i}

So we require a core to be a subgraph U with high CC(U),
but also to be a well-deﬁned cluster—i.e. to have compar-
atively many edges within. Now, if there are many facets
of the centrality concept, there are even more algorithms
to identify graph clusters, each being a de facto cluster-
deﬁnition (33). For simplicity we choose the most rudimen-
tary cluster-deﬁnition—the set of k-cores. A k-core is a max-
imal subgraph with the minimum degree k (maximal in the

TABLE I The network sizes N and M, the core-periphery coeﬃcient ccp and the relative assortative mixing coeﬃcient ∆r for a number of
networks. In the interstate network the vertices are American interstate highway junctions and two junctions are connected if there is a road
with no junction in between. The pipeline network is a similar network of junctions and gas pipes. In the street networks the vertices are
Swedish city street segments connected if they share a junction. In the airport data (obtained from IATA www.iata.org) the vertices are airports
and the edges represent airport pairs with a non-stop ﬂight connection. The Internet ﬁgures are averages of 15 AS-level graphs constructed from
traceroute searches. The arXiv, board of directors and Ajou students are constructed one-mode projections from aﬃliation networks (where
links goes from persons to e-prints, corporate boards and university classes respectively). The student network is averaged over graphs for 16
semesters. One edge represent two students taking at least three classes together that semester. The high school, prisoner and social scientist
networks are gathered from questionnaires—an edge means that two persons have listed each other as acquaintances. The high school data are
averaged over 84 individual schools. In the electronic communication networks one edge represent that at least one of the vertices has contacted
the other over some electronic medium. In the nd.edu data the vertices are HTML documents and the edges are hyperlink. The citation graph
is constructed from preprints in the ﬁeld of high-energy physics (1) (see: http://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/kddcup/datasets.html). In the
software dependency graph the vertices are software packages and an edge means that one package needs the other for its proper function.
The food webs are networks of water-living species and an edge means that one species prey on the other. For the protein networks an edge
means that two proteins bind to each other physically. The metabolic and “whole cellular” networks consist of chemical substances and edges
indicating that one molecule occur in the same reaction as the other (the values for these networks are averages over 43 organisms from
diﬀerent domains of life).

sense that if one adds any vertex to a k-core it will no longer
have a minimal degree k). To calculate a sequence of k-cores
is computationally cheaper (linear in M (17)) than more elab-
orate clustering algorithms.1 So we let our core Vcore(G) be the
k-core with maximal closeness and deﬁne the core-periphery

where G(G) is the ensemble of graphs with the same set of de-
grees as G. The sequence of k-cores is not necessarily unique.
We maximize CC(U) over mseq diﬀerent sequences. In prac-
tice diﬀerent runs almost always yield the same core, and the
value of mseq seems to matter little. The mnull elements of
G(G) can be obtained by randomization of G in time and space
of the order of M (39). In this paper we use mnull = 1000 and
mseq = 10 for networks with N < 5000, and mnull = 50 and
mseq = 3 for N ≥ 5000.

The correlation of degrees at either side of an edge is an
informative structure to study (29; 31; 37). To some extent
one can see degree-degree correlations as a local version of
the core-periphery structure—when there are positive degree-
degree correlations, at least some subgraphs of the network
will have a well-deﬁned core and periphery. Such clusters
need not be centrally positioned in the graph as a whole, so
while the degree-degree correlations says something about if
the graph can be separated into densely and sparsely con-
nected regions, the core-periphery structure gives information
of the relative position of such regions. A common way to
quantify the average degree-degree correlations is to measure
the assortative mixing coeﬃcient (31)

where ki is the degree of the i’th argument of a edge as it
appear in a list of E. Now, our null-model is a random graph
conditioned to have the same degree sequence as the original
graph. In other words, just as for the core-periphery structure,
we consider the deviation from our null model and measure
the relative assortative mixing coeﬃcient

B. Numerical results for real-world networks

In Table I ccp and ∆r are displayed for a number of real-
world networks. We ﬁnd that the core-periphery structure and
relative degree-degree correlations follow the diﬀerent classes
of networks rather closely. Furthermore the core-periphery
structure and degree-degree correlations seem to be quite in-
dependent network structures in practice. For example, ge-
ographically embedded networks have a clear core-periphery
structure and weakly positive degree-degree correlations; so-
cial networks derived from aﬃliations have slightly nega-
tive ccp-values but very high ∆r-values; networks of online
communication have markedly negative ccp and rather neu-
tral degree-degree correlations. Most geographically embed-
ded networks have the function of transporting, or transmit-
ting, something between the vertices. Networks with a well-
deﬁned core (which most paths pass through) and a periphery
(covering most of the area) are known to have good perfor-
mance with respect to communication times (19). Also net-
works of airline traﬃc (21) and the hardwired Internet (36; 45)
are known to have well-deﬁned cores due to traﬃc-ﬂow op-
timization. The class of one-mode projection networks (so-
cial networks constructed by linking people that participate in
something—movies, scientiﬁc research, etc.—together) show
slightly negative ccp-values. This can, at least for the data sets
of scientiﬁc coauthors (30) and fellow students of a Korean
university (24; 35), be explained by that there is a grouping of
the people on the basis of specialization (and, in student net-
works, also in grade) and thus no well-deﬁned core. We note
that this group of networks have very high ∆r values. The in-
terview based acquaintance networks show rather neutral ccp-
values and positive ∆r suggesting that there is a degree of in-
dependence between. This is quite similar to the one-mode

FIG. 1 Core-periphery structure of model networks. The Barab´asi-
Albert and Watts-Strogatz networks have M = 2N. The core-
periphery model has the parameter fcore = 0.96 (i.e. the intended core
consists of 4% of the vertices) and γ = 3. All values are averaged
over 104-105 network realizations. The BA-model line is a ﬁt to an
power-law form α0 + α1N−α2 (this ﬁt gives ccp(∞) = α0 = 0.004(9)).

projections, which probably is not a coincidence—there is a
strong correlation between acquaintance ties and the organiza-
tions people are aﬃliated with. The vertices in electronic com-
munication networks are also people but the network struc-
tures of these are quite diﬀerent; the degree-degree correlation
is typically slightly negative, as is the core-periphery coeﬃ-
cient. Information networks where the edges refer to support-
ing information sources (our examples are a subgraph of the
WWW and a graph of citations between papers in high-energy
physics) can be expected to be grouped into topics, thus the
negative ccp. The same explanation applies to the negative ccp
of the software dependency graph. Food webs are other strat-
iﬁed networks where a lack of a well-deﬁned core seems nat-
ural. The core of the neural network of C. elegans is a clique
(fully connected subgraph) of eight neurons, which accounts
for positive ccp and ∆r values. The biochemical networks all
show negative ccp values and negative, or neutral, relative as-
sortative mixing coeﬃcients.

C. Numerical results for network models

In addition to the real-world networks of Table I we also
measure the core-periphery coeﬃcient for a few network mod-
els. For simple random graphs (15) where N vertices are ran-
domly connected by M edges, deﬁning an ensemble G(N, M)
of graphs, G(G) is precisely the elements of G(N, M) with the
same degree sequence as G. This means that, on average, ccp
will be zero for random graphs. A popular network model
is the Barab´asi-Albert (BA) model (4) where the graphs are
grown by iteratively adding new vertices with edges to old
vertices with a probability proportional to the degree of the
old vertices. In Fig. 1 we see that ccp tends to zero (or a value
very close to zero) for BA model networks. The BA model
has an assortative mixing coeﬃcient r that tends to zero as
N grows (31). From this one sees that the high-degree ver-
tices are not more interconnected than can be expected from
their degrees, and thus that there is no preference in the ac-

tual wiring of the network for a well-deﬁned core in the sense
of the ccp-coeﬃcient. We also investigate the Watts-Strogatz’
small-world network model (43) were one end of the edges
of a circulant (8) is rewired with a certain probability (0.01
in our case). Just as for the BA model ccp converges to zero
(see Fig. 1). This is not so surprising, in the WS model’s
starting point, the circulant, every vertex is in the same po-
sition. The rewiring procedure does not aggregate vertices
to a well-deﬁned core either. Finally we construct a network
model with a positive core-periphery coeﬃcient. We start by
drawing N power-law distributed random integers in the in-
terval [2, ∞), i.e. the probability for a number m to be drawn
is proportional to m−γ, and sort these numbers in increasing
order: m1, · · · , mN. These numbers are the desired degrees of
the vertices and can be thought of as stubs, or half-edges, that
need to be connected. Now we will attempt to make a well-
deﬁned core of the vertices icore
is the inte-
ger closest to N fcore (so fcore is a parameter setting the relative
size of the core). Then we go through the vertices icore
, · · · , N
in increasing order and for each vertex i try to attach the stubs
the vertices j = i + 1, · · · , N (once again in increasing order)
as long as the degree of j is less than m j. The remaining stubs
are paired together randomly and made into edges if they do
not form loops or multiple edges. The superﬂuous stubs are
then deleted. For this model ccp indeed shows positive and
growing values, see Fig. 1.

III. RADIAL ORGANIZATION OF NETWORKS

A well-deﬁned core is a useful starting point for a radial
examination of the network. By plotting quantities averaged
over the n-neighborhoods (the set of vertices at a distance n of
a vertex) of the core vertices as functions of n one can get an
idea of the respective purposes of the core and periphery. This
kind of statistics is naturally more sensible the stronger the
core-periphery structure is. The ccp construction identiﬁes the
most central well-connected core but it does not say whether
or not the core make sense—even for slightly negative ccp-
values this type of radial statistics may be informative. While
authors have focused on the size of the n-neighborhoods of
random vertices (26; 38)—a useful approach to monitor ﬁnite-
size eﬀects that aﬀects spreading processes such as disease
epidemics—we will focus on quantities that we ﬁnd more in-
formative regarding the relative functions of the core and pe-
riphery.

To get a rough view of the radial network organization we
plot the average degree of the vertices in the n-neighborhood
of core-vertices as a function of n in Fig. 2. We include the
corresponding results for our null model (random networks
constrained to the same degree sequence as the original). The
core vertices themselves almost always get higher average
degree for the null-model than the real-world networks (5-
10% higher for the networks of Fig. 2). For the ﬁrst neigh-
borhood the situation is reversed—the real-world networks
have higher hki than the null-model. Then the degrees are
decreasing monotonically; typically faster for the null-model
networks. For the street network in Fig. 2(a) hki decreases

4

rather slowly for intermediate n; the periphery is thus rather
homogeneous. The short average distances of the core, con-
sisting of the streets of the city center, can be attributed to its
central geographic position.

One can imagine diﬀerent functions of the peripheral
vertices—either they are just conveying information, traﬃc,
etc. to and from the core; or they are, just as the core-vertices,
involved in the general network processes, only less intensely.
To understand this we measure the average value of the quan-
tity

µ(i, n) = M(Kn(i))/EM(Kn(i))

(6)

over the core vertices; M(Kn(i)) is the number of edges within
i’s n-neighborhood Kn(i) and EM(Kn(i)) is the expected num-
ber of edges in a set of vertices of the same degrees as Kn(i)
in a random graph of the same degree sequence as the original
graph G. Calculating of EM is known to be a hard counting
problem (6), so we have to rely on the same random sam-
pling as for the ccp-calculation. To save time one can calcu-
late EM(K) as the average number of edges within the original
subgraph K at the same time as the G(G)-sampling of the ccp
calculation. In Fig. 2(d)-(f) we diagram hµi(n) for our three
example networks. Since the core is constructed to be highly
inter-connected it is no surprise that hµi has a peak for small
n. For the metabolic network of Fig. 2(f) this peak is small.
This is due to the exceptionally high degrees ∼ 55 of the core
vertices (including substrates such as H2O, ATP and ADP)—
even in the null-model networks this set of vertices will, for
combinatorial reasons, be highly interconnected. For interme-
diate n the hµi-values are of the order of unity, i.e. there is no
overrepresentation of edges between vertices at this distance
from the core. But as n increases, hµi grows to a sharp peak
before it eventually drops to zero. This seems like a rather
ubiquitous feature (at least it is present in almost all networks
of Table I). We interpret this as that the periphery has both the
two functions listed above: To a certain distance from the core
(deﬁned by the peak) vertices have similar function and are for
this reason connected (and since such small set of, probably,
low-degree vertices is unlikely to have many interior edges
µ becomes high); beyond this distance the network consists
only of cycle-free branches. This dichotomy—the network
in- and outside of the peak radius—is yet more distinct than
the core vs. periphery as deﬁned above. On the other hand the
outside is functionally rather trivial and (in all cases we study)
smaller than the inside (we believe the term “core” is more apt
for smaller subgraphs). We note that this peak is not trivially
related to the peak in the size of the n-neighborhood which is
much broader and occurs for smaller n.

IV. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

In many networks the properties of vertices are heteroge-
neously distributed, similarly one can ﬁnd subgraphs with
very diﬀerent characteristics and function. Perhaps the sim-
plest division of a network is that into a core and a periphery.
The core concept has been used in various senses in the past;

FIG. 2 Radial statistics for three real-world networks. (a)-(c) show the average degree hki of the n-neighborhoods of the core vertices as a
function of n for three real world networks: a network of streets in Stockholm, Sweden (40), a network of hyperlinked web-pages (3) and the
metabolic network of C. elegans (25). Curves for our null-model—random networks with the same degree sequence as the original network—
are included. In (a)-(c) we plot the number of edges with in the n-neighborhood relative to the expected number of edges given the degree
sequence of the n-neighborhood and the graph as a whole. Lines are guides for the eyes.

typically it is deﬁned as a subgraph which is most tightly con-
nected (7; 16) or a most central (9).
In this paper we use
the rather strong precepts that a core should be both highly
interconnected and central. To quantify this idea, we deﬁne
the core as the k-core of highest closeness centrality. Then,
to measure the strength of the tendency to have a central and
highly connected core, we deﬁne a core-periphery coeﬃcient
as the normalized closeness centrality of the core minus the
same corresponding average value for our null-model (ran-
dom networks of the same degree sequence as the original
network). Diﬀerent types of networks have their characteris-
tic ccp-values: Geographically embedded networks typically
have a positive core-periphery coeﬃcient. We explain this as
an eﬀect of their communication-time optimization. Social
network, on the other hand, typically have slightly negative ccp
values despite their positive degree-degree correlations. We
show that ccp for model networks such as the Erd˝os-R´enyi,
Barab´asi-Albert and Watts-Strogatz models goes to zero (or
at least to a very small value) as the network size increases
but, that one can construct networks with a positive ccp in the
large system limit. Once the core of a network is found one
can construct a radial image of the network by plotting quan-
tities averaged over the n-neighborhoods of the core vertices
as a function of n. One such quantity we study is µ(n, i)—the
relative number of edges within the n-neighborhood of i to the
expected number of edges in a subgraph of the same set of
degrees in the null-model. hµi shows, almost ubiquitously, a
peak at intermediate n. We interpret this peak as an eﬀective
radius of the network. Much remains to be done in terms of
characterizing the cores and peripheries of complex networks.
We believe this dichotomy and the radial imagery we present
are very useful tools to understand the large-scale architecture
of such networks.

Abstract

We propose a continuum model for the description of buyer and seller dynamics in
an Internet market. The relevant variables are the research eﬀort of buyers and the
sellers’ reputation building process. We show that, if a commercial web-site gives
consumers the possibility to rate credibly sellers they bargained with, vendors are
forced to be more honest. This leads to mutual beneﬁcial symbiosis between buyers
and sellers; the overall enhanced volume of transactions contributes ultimately to
the web-site, which facilitates the matchmaking service.

1 The Problem

The Internet provides a new venue for commercial transactions, though there is
still no consensus as to what fundamental mechanism makes a commercial web
site tick or ﬂop. In the law of supply and demand, transactions are beneﬁcial
to both buyers and sellers in general. However, so-called market failures can
happen if the information about the quality of the product is very asymmetric.

In the last few decades economists have made fundamental research work in
this area —for instance the famous paper by George Akerlof on the ”Lemon’s
Problem” [1] as well as more general applications of asymmetric information
in many economic relationships by Joe Stiglitz et al.; for a recent review see
[2].

What is special about Internet commerce? In the last few years the much ini-
tial enthusiasm turned into big disappointment, after many high ﬂyers crashed
and the Internet commerce bubble blowed. We feel that the fundamental mech-
anism is not yet generally appreciate. In this paper we want to highlight the
unique role played by the reputation system. In the Internet commerce, the
information asymmetry is extreme: buyers cannot evaluate the quality of prod-
ucts before purchasing them. Even worse, buyers don’t even see sellers in their
face, as in an oﬀ-line transaction. Thus the information asymmetry is much
more severe than in the traditional commerce modes. The Internet, on the
other hand, oﬀers tremendous opportunities, since buyers can access a vast
choice of products and the search costs are much reduced.

So, we face the dilemma: how to tap into the huge potential while avoiding the
proverbial information asymmetry? Our analysis will show that the holy grail
rests in binding the collective knowledge of all buyers about the sellers’ reputa-
tion. The Internet commerce has the unprecedented potential to leverage the
collective buying experience in a centralized place. Though a less than honest
seller can get away with a questionable transaction on one buyer, the dissat-
isﬁed buyer can easily post his rating on this particular seller. Reputation is
a valuable asset that no vendor can ignore. Indeed, most of the fast growing
e-commerce web sites, including Internet auctions sites such as eBay [3], allow
buyers to rate sellers after receiving the product they bid for. The ensemble
of those ratings builds up a seller’s reputation that can be viewed ever since
by other buyers, thus replacing (and sometimes improving) the direct quality
check of usual street shopping.

Our analysis is based on the fundamental conviction that sellers have the
option of being honest or not. If the web site can establish a credible rating
system to capture buyers’ feedback, it eﬀectively ﬁlters out dishonest sellers.
There are no permanent cheaters, they must ﬁnd other ways to make a living
that are also beneﬁcial to the society. The matchmaking service, provided by
the web-site, facilitates a selection process that is the opposite of ”adverse
selection” [4]. Those sellers with good quality, would be encourage to join by
a honest representation, while the dishonest ones wouldn’t even want to try.
Such a service can be easily rewarded, since such a web-site can take a slice
from the mutually beneﬁcial transactions. Our results show that the extent of
the total transactions depends on the quality of the feedback rating system.

Our approach is to model buyers and sellers as two species in symbiosis, much

2

like in population dynamics. In fact, our equations share many similarities
with the well-known Lotka-Volterra model [5,6]. The key is to realize the two
species have both converging as well as diverging interests: Buyers need sellers,
the more the better, and vice versa. This much they have converging interests.
But, in a particular transaction, a buyer’s loss is the seller’s gain. However,
on the aggregate level transactions between the two groups are non-zero sum
games —in fact positive sum games.

2 The Model

At time t, B(t) potential buyers and S(t) sellers meet in our virtual market-
place. Buyers’ rationality is bounded by incomplete information and limited
computing capability, but we retain the assumption of procedural rationality
[7]. This means agents only dispose of a few options, but they are able to
choose better ones with higher probability, provided they are given correct
information. We shall consider a fast growing regime, assuming the number of
buyers B(t) grows exponentially in time. Regular users may decide to continue
trading or stop doing so, according to their satisfaction at previous times.

The interest a given seller has in staying on that market can be easily estimated
as a function of the earnings made. If he gained nothing, it is very probable
that he won’t repeat the experience. Sometimes he may lower his honesty
in the hope to make more money, or increase it in order to sell more. On
the other hand, buyers’ proﬁtability has to be inferred. Neglecting possible
technical dysfunctions, delivery failures and other inconvenients not directly
related to the actors of the transaction, there are two main possible sources of
discontent: the item could diﬀer from what the buyer was originally looking
for, or its state of usage could be worse than he was promised. If a buyer is
not satisﬁed, he is not likely to visit the web-site again in the near future.

Each seller s only sells products of a kind (xs) and is characterized by his
honesty hs, which can be interpreted as the ratio quality/price he is selling at.
His satisfaction γs(t) is deﬁned as the number of products sold ns(t), times
the normalized unitary gain ghs:

γs(t) = ns(t)ghs

ghs = 1 − hs + m,

(1)
(2)

where m is the minimum proﬁt margin, i.e. a percentage of the price that
covers all expenses and leaves a revenue even to the most honest vendors. Here
1 − hs can be regarded as an extra-proﬁt that would equal zero in a perfectly
competitive market. We assume no price discrimination on an individual basis,

3

i.e. hs does not depend on the particular buyer s is dealing with, even though
this phenomenon may arise in particular contests [8].

Each buyer b looks, at time t, for a speciﬁcally desired product xb. Products
xk, be they desired or sold, can be represented as elements of a metric space
(real numbers or bit strings), where we can deﬁne a normalized distance db,s =
d(xb, xs) ∈ [0, 1) and an overlap qb,s = 1 − db,s. The latter measures how close
a product xs is to the buyer’s desire xb. Now, if b buys a unit of x˜s, once he
receives it he is rewarded with a payoﬀ rb,˜s. His satisfaction γb(t) then equals:

rb,˜s if b purchased x˜s at time t;

if b purchased nothing at time t;

γb(t) = 


0



It is reasonable that rb,s be an increasing function of hs (buyers are more
satisﬁed if the purchased product has a better ratio quality/price) and qb,s
(buyers are more satisﬁed if the purchased product is closer to their wishes).
Hence we deﬁne

rb,s = hsqb,s.

Finally, buyer b can rate seller’s s honesty and inﬂuence his reputation. This
happens for every buyer who deals with seller s at each time step, therefore
one’s reputation tends to his honesty hs. Buyers, then, can take a look at sell-
ers’ reputation before purchasing a product. Whenever a diﬀerence between
reputation and honesty is not explicitly mentioned, we shall assume they co-
incide. On the other hand, buyers are allowed to trust it or not, in a way we
will describe later on.

Now we have a deﬁnition of buyers’ and sellers’ satisfaction. Their role becomes
clear once we specify the dynamics: we will do that ﬁrst, leaving the details of
the transaction process for later sections. Since we are aiming to give a mean
ﬁeld description of the system, it is useful to introduce the average buyers’
and sellers’ satisfactions

ΓB(t) =

γb(t)/B(t)

ΓS(t) =

γs(t)/S(t).

faced the same situation a great number of times. Let us assume h is a discrete

Then we can consider the number of sellers Sh(t) belonging to a certain honesty
class, with S(t) =

Xs:hs=h

Xh

Here and in the following, angular brackets stand for averages over the honesty
distribution

p(h, t) = Sh(t)/S(t).

Notice that, while ΓB(t) is constrained in the range [0, 1], the value of ΓSh is
only bounded by (m + 1)B(t). Now we are able to write H + 1 replicator dy-
namics type [9] diﬀerential equations, describing the mean ﬁeld time evolution
of B(t) and Sh(t), for h = 0, ∆h, 2∆h, ..., 1:

dB(t)
dt
dSh(t)
dt

= cBB(t) − [1 − ΓB(t)]B(t)

= ∆h[ΓS(t) − 1]S(t) + [ΓSh(t) − 1]Sh(t).

Here the parameter cB is a factor of growth, which embeds all the external
conditions, such as liquidity and competition eﬀects. Summing equation (11)
over h we obtain

dS(t)
dt

= 2[ΓS(t) − 1]S(t).

(12)

The above equations arise from the following dynamics. At time t every buyer
attracts cB users in the web-site. Among the old clients a percentage ΓB ∈ [0, 1]
survives, while the others leave. In other words, the probability that an active
buyer continues shopping in this market at future times is proportional to his
satisfaction at time t. As for sellers, the term ∆h[ΓS(t) − 1]S(t) on the r.h.s. of
equation (11) acts uniformly on every h level. Since ΓS(t) is the average proﬁt
a seller made at time t, it represents a general measure of proﬁtability for the
web-site. If it is bigger than a given value, which we arbitrarily posit equal to
one, new sellers are likely to add listings to the web-site. We can think they
are people who only look at aggregate results before entering a market, non
professional vendors drawn from a uniform honesty distribution. If ΓS < 1
some of these persons will drop out, with the understanding that Sh(t) be set
to zero if it falls below it. The second term [ΓSh(t) − 1]Sh(t) of equation (11)

5

is strongly h-dependent. When it is smaller than one, a percentage 1 − ΓSh
of sellers of honesty h drops out, vice-versa when ΓSh > 1. In this case the
newcomers are fairly well informed about the market dynamics and estimate
how much extra-proﬁt they can make, thus choosing a speciﬁc entry honesty
level. Notice that the honesty hs of a given active seller cannot be changed in
time, but s can always exit and come back with a more proﬁtable one.

The functions Γ depend on the probability distribution µ(q) of the overlap,
arising from the choice of the metric space of products, and on the amount of
information buyers collect before purchasing an item. In the following sections
we shall analyze two particular cases. First we shall model consumers going
for one speciﬁc product (maximal selection); then ﬂexible ones, looking for a
product similar “enough” to their wishes (browsing agents).

3 Maximal selection

Here we analyze a process where potential consumers decide whether to buy
or not a single particular item per time unit. As we already mentioned, a buyer
b access the web-site looking for a desired product xb. Now he considers what
is available in the market, picks the item that ﬁts best his request, decides
whether to buy it or not, and ﬁnally he may receive and judge it. Let us
assume that, thanks to internal search tools of the web-site, he ﬁnds the item
xˆsb corresponding to the maximum overlap qb,ˆsb = maxs qb,s. Then he evaluates
it, checking the seller’s reputation, and decides if he wants to buy it or not,
with no further research. He purchases it with probability fb(ˆsb), proportional
to the buyer’s expected reward. The latter can diﬀer from the actual payoﬀ
ri,ˆsb (4) he would eventually get from the purchase. In fact, at this stage, the
buyer does not have the product xˆsb in his hands and can only guess upon
the available information. He could, therefore, trust diﬀerently his perception
of hs and qb,s, the ﬁrst one coming from other buyers’ ratings of seller ˆsb, the
second from a description (sometimes a picture) of the item, provided by the
seller himself. Hence we deﬁne

fb(s) = hα

s qb,s,

where the exponent α is a parameter that tunes the weight consumers give to
sellers’ reputation. If he decides to buy, b eventually receives the product, rates
seller ˆsb with hˆsb and is rewarded with a payoﬀ rb,ˆsb. The average satisfaction
then equals

(14)

ΓB(t) =

fb(ˆsb)rb,ˆsb =

When we take the average over all buyers, we are implicitly averaging over the
honesty distribution p(h, t) (9), because the index ˆsb depends on the chosen
seller. Let us approximate qb,ˆsb with its average value over all buyers qmax;
then

ΓB(t) = hhα+1iq2

max.

(15)

Every seller has equal probability to maximize the overlap of a given buyer.
Conversely their probability to sell a product once chosen, and their unitary
proﬁt, depend on their honesty level. The average proﬁt made by a seller of
honesty h then reads

ΓSh(t) = Nh(t)gh

(1 − h + m),

B(t)
S(t)

s:hs=h ns(t)/Sh(t) is the average number of items sold by
where Nh(t) =
a seller of honesty h. According to deﬁnition (8), the aggregate satisfaction
arising from (16) reads:

P

ΓS(t) =

B(t)
S(t)

(1 + m)hhαi − hhα+1i
h

.

It is worth noticing the strong feedback eﬀect contained in it: if S(t) becomes
much larger than B(t), then ΓS(t) diminishes, thus slowing down the growing
rate of S(t) itself. As a consequence a stationary state is reached when B(t) and
S(t) grow exponentially with the same exponent, which is entirely determined
by limt→∞ ΓB(t) = ΓB. An example is given in ﬁgure 1.

In the limit of large S we can employ the following approximation:

qmax

µ(q)dq ≃ 1 −

1
S(t) + 1

,

(16)

(17)

(18)

where µ(q) is the overlap distribution. Equation (18) becomes exact if µ(q) is
uniform. Let us assume, for the sake of simplicity, that products xs are real
numbers uniformly distributed between zero and one. A natural deﬁnition of
the distance between two products, on the torus [0, 1], is

db,s = min(|xb − xs|, 1 − |xb − xs|),

(19)

7

which yields the following overlap distribution:

where Θ is the Heaviside function. Equation (18) then gives

µ(q) = 2Θ(q − 0.5),

qmax =

2S(t) + 1
2(S(t) + 1)

.

(20)

(21)

We solved numerically equations (10) and (11), with deﬁnition (15) for buyers’
satisfaction and deﬁnition (16), in the approximation (21), for that of sellers.
Positing a uniform distribution at time zero, we focused on the honesty distri-
bution of sellers in the stationary regime p(h) = limt→∞ p(h, t). Since p(h, t)
(9) results from a natural selection of sellers as a consequence of buyers’ be-
havior, honesties appearing with greater probability reﬂect higher earnings
realized by the corresponding sellers. The lower graph of ﬁgure 2 shows a shift
of distribution p(h) towards a greater average honesty hhi, as the value of α is
increased. In our model α is the relevant parameter: the larger it is, the more
buyers take sellers’ reputation into account. In fact the probability fb(ˆsb) (13)
that buyer b actually purchases product xˆsb, decreases for greater α. Such a
decrease is not uniform in h, but scales as a power law. As a result, with
increasing α sellers with higher honesty are more favored, their relative fre-
quency is enhanced and so is buyer’s probability of purchase. The net result of
these two competing eﬀects is a greater buyers’ satisfaction, in the stationary
state, when α is bigger. This appears clearly in ﬁgure 3, where the average
honesty hhi (upper graph) and the buyers’ satisfaction ΓB (lower graph) are
shown to be increasing functions of α. As already mentioned, ΓB determines
the slope of both buyers and sellers exponential growth. We conclude that
a greater α exerts more selective pressure on sellers, giving rise to a more
eﬃcient market and to a faster growth of the web-site usage.

4 Browsing agents

If, instead of considering only the product that maximizes his overlap, a buyer
also looks at other oﬀers, he might ﬁnd better deals. To make things clear,
imagine a parameter ρ ∈ (0, 0.5] tunes the width of customers’ search for
goods. Among the S items available in the market, buyer b examines the ones
(2S(t)ρ on average) closer than ρ to his desired one, i.e. those that fulﬁll the
condition db,s < ρ. This mimics a situation where buyers browse the portion of
the web-site containing products they might be interested in. This task is made
easy by the division of products into categories, provided by most portals, and
by the possibility to display ﬁrst the ones sold by more reputable sellers. Buyer

8

b can thus operate a quick selection, after which he picks only one product s,
with probability zb(s), and analyzes it more closely. In the preceding section we
analyzed the case ρ → 0, where zb(s) becomes a Dirac delta function centered
in xˆsb. We want to approach here the opposite limit, that of agents performing
a wide search before evaluating something for purchase.

Once he has chosen an item x˜s, buyer b proceeds as before: he purchases it with
probability fb(˜s) (13), and is eventually rewarded with rb,˜s (4). The average
buyers’ satisfaction over all transactions taking place at time t, namely ΓB(t),
then reads

ΓB(t) =

1
B(t)

Xb Xs:db,s<ρ

zb(s)fb(s)rb,s.

(22)

It is sensible to deﬁne zb(s) as a monotonically increasing function of fb(s).
This means the probability of choosing a certain product for evaluation, is
proportional to the probability of actually buying it afterwards. This is jus-
tiﬁed as long as items in the web-site are well organized and sorted. In order
to be consistent with such an assumption, the exact functional form of zb(s)
must somehow compensate the density of products available within a given
portion of the space. If products are real numbers uniformly distributed in the
domain [0, 1] and we adopt deﬁnition (19) for the distance, then µ(q) is ﬂat
and we can simply set a linear dependence:

zb(s) =

fb(s)
s:db,s<ρ fb(s)

.

P

Let us deﬁne the conditional probability µ(qb,s|xb) that a buyer b has overlap
qb,s with seller s, given his desire xb. Inserting equation (23) in (22), and
employing deﬁnitions (4) and (13), we obtain:

We solved numerically equations (10) and (11) with the above deﬁnitions of
the Γ-s and with a uniform initial honesty distribution of sellers. In the upper
graphs of ﬁgures 2 and 4 we show the α and m-dependence of the stable
honesty distribution p(h) for browsing agents. The lower graphs of these ﬁgures
show, as a comparison, simulations with maximal selection. For any given set
of the parameters, browsing buyers force sellers to be more honest than q-
maximizing ones. This is also shown in the upper graph of ﬁgure 3, where the
α-dependence of average honesty is displayed. Now we can ask ourselves if
also the web-site usage grows more with browsing agents than in the maximal
selection case. In the lower graph of ﬁgure 3 the stationary buyers’ average
satisfaction ΓB, which governs the slope of the exponential growth of B(t) and
S(t), is plotted against α. Up to α ≃ 7.5 we certainly have a faster growth
with browsing agents. A typical snapshot of this situation is given in ﬁgure
5, where the stationary honesty distribution and the time growth of B(t) are
shown in the two cases. For greater values of α the average honesty approaches
a plateau, and so does ΓB. This limit is rather unrealistic: the overlap q plays
nearly no role in the decision of purchase, being dominated by hα. It becomes,
therefore, more proﬁtable to adopt the maximal selection strategy. We should
also stress that, in a competitive market, a higher average honesty of sellers
would improve the overall web-site reputation, thus increasing the value of
cB and, consequently, the growth rate of B(t). We will, nevertheless, neglect

10

this eﬀect. Finally, ﬁgure 6 shows that ΓB grows with ρ —and so does ΓS.
This conﬁrms the Marriage Problem instance [10]: increased information, even
restricted to one side (in our case that of buyers), is beneﬁcial to the whole
society.

It is useful to reformulate the dynamics, i.e. eqs. (10), (11) and (12), in terms
of variables

5 Dynamical equilibrium

σ(h, t) = p(h, t)/∆h
η(t) = B(t)/S(t),

whose time derivatives read:

˙σ(h, t) = (ΓS(t) − 1) + σ(h, t)[ΓSh(t) − 2ΓS(t) + 1]

˙η(t) = η(t)[ΓB(t) − 2ΓS(t) + 1 + cB].

These variables eventually reach a constant value, due to the equilibration
of two sets of competing eﬀects. First, that of sellers’ honesty: a greater h
level enhances the probability of selling a product (see (13)), but reduces the
unitary gain gh = 1 + m − h (2). Second, that of the ratio buyers/sellers: a
bigger η(t) means there are more buyers for each seller. This increases the
average sellers’ satisfaction ΓS(t), which in turn makes S(t) increase, and η(t)
diminish. The stationarity condition yields:

ΓB + cB − 1 = 2(ΓS − 1)

σ(h) =

(ΓS − 1)
2ΓS − ΓSh − 1

,

from which it is clear that the inequality ΓB > 1 − cB must hold to ensure
growth. Equation (34) is the result of our darwinian-type selection, which im-
plies that the most frequent h-population be the most ﬁt (satisﬁed). From
equation (16) (resp. (27)) we can compute the mode hM S

tribution p(h):

When the mode equals one, fully honest sellers have an advantage over the
others. If that happens for a given set of parameters (m, α), agents’ satisfaction
approaches a limit value. In ﬁgure 3 this is shown, in particular, for the α-
dependence of ΓB. Equations (35) and (36) explain why the plateau value is
reached faster with browsing agents.

In order to ﬁnd the stationary honesty distribution, we should solve equation
(33) for η and substitute the result into (34). For the case of browsing agents,
by inserting expressions (26), (27) and (28) in equations (33) and (34), we
obtain:

η =

σ(h) =

(cB + 1)hhαi + a1hh2α+1i

Now equation (38) can be solved self-consistently.

Similarly, for the case of maximal selection, we insert equations (15), (16) and
(17) into (33), we eliminate η and substitute the expressions thus obtained in
(34). Finally we end up with the following equation:

where ˜uα(h) is given by

˜uα(h) = hα(1 + m) − hα+1.

The above relation (39) can be also solved self-consistently. An example is
given in ﬁgure 7, where the theoretical stationary distribution arising from
(39) is shown to match exactly the one found solving numerically the original
time dependent diﬀerential equations, (10) and (11), with the same set of
parameters. All other stationary quantities can be calculated accordingly.

6 Honesty vs Reputation

In the preceding sections we assumed reputation equals honesty. The two
could, in fact, diﬀer for the following main reasons. The ﬁrst source of problem
relies in imprecise consumers’ ratings, but it is the minor one if the volume
of aﬀairs is big, since mistakes have no preferential direction. Moreover ∆h
can be chosen of the same order of magnitude as the variance of individual
mistakes, thus identifying h with the consumers’ average judgment. Second
comes cheating, that is a seller, who has so far been good, might occasionally
sell at an higher price. This could temporarily improve the gain of some seller,
but it should only aﬀect the variance and not the average satisfaction of buyers
in the stationary regime. Thirdly, the reputation building process could be very
inaccurate. We shall concentrate on the latter because it seems to be the main
shortcoming of some commercial web-sites existing today.

Let us consider the extreme case, although common, where the rating form
available in the web-site allows buyers to state if they made a good bargain
or not, with no further speciﬁcation. As a result, reputation consists in being
good (hg) or bad (hb), and this is the only information about sellers buyers are
provided with. Once they purchased a product, though, buyers can evaluate it
accurately and judge it according to their proper honesty scale. Therefore the
“true” honesty level h still plays the same role here as in equation (4), whereas
elsewhere it must be substituted by ˜h, the two levels reputation. Equations
(26), (27) and (28) then become:

ΓB(t) =

ΓSh(t) =

ΓS(t) =

1 + ˜ρ2
2
1 − ˜ρ3
1 − ˜ρ2
1 − ˜ρ3
1 − ˜ρ2

hh˜h2αi
h˜hαi
2B(t)
3S(t)

˜h2α
h˜hαi

2B(t)
3S(t)h˜hαi

(1 − h + m)

(1 + m)h˜h2αi − hh˜h2αi
h

i

,

where ˜h = hg if h ≥ 1/2 and ˜h = hb if h < 1/2.

(41)

(42)

(43)

In this situation sellers less honest than 0.5 tend to die out. For the higher
intrinsic honesty levels, those who are closer to 0.5 are favored, and p(h)
decays exponentially toward h = 1. This defect of information transmission,
something like a narrow channel eﬀect [11], damages severely the web-site
usage. In ﬁg. 8 we plotted the time evolution of B(t) in this binary case, with
hg = 1 − ∆h and hb = ∆h, together with the case of browsing agents with
perfect judging forms at their disposal. It is clear that the latter case shows a
much faster growth.

We have shown, within our model, that a good rating form can help the growth
of a commercial web-site, overcoming the problem of asymmetrical informa-
tion. But, how is buyers’ browsing ability inﬂuenced by its architecture? A
good categorization of products is, of course, important: this way we would
probably approach the most proﬁtable region of ﬁgure 3. We believe a major
step forward would be achieved once it will be possible to guess accurately
buyers’ future wishes [12,13].

The equations we studied, i.e. (10) and (11), can be regarded as mean-ﬁeld
approximations to a stochastic behavior. We suppose, on average, an expo-
nential growth of the web-site usage: this might mimic a fast growing stage
of e-commerce web-sites. We believe the role of honesty and information we
tried to stylize here applies to any situation where a great number of sellers is
easily reachable to any buyer.

Our calculations are carried out by identifying buyers and sellers with real
numbers: this is a useful simpliﬁcation, but it is easy to substitute them with
bit strings. In this case the distance (19) becomes the hemming distance, and
probability (23) should be redeﬁned appropriately.

Full information and unlimited processing capability of buyers could, in princi-
ple, allow them to maximize directly the product hq. Let us imagine each buyer
b follows the maximal selection strategy, with ˆsb = [ˆs : hˆsqb,ˆs = maxs hsqb,s].
This would favor so much honest sellers that the honesty distribution p(h)
would become a delta function centered in h = 1, which corresponds to a
perfectly eﬃcient market.

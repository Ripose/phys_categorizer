Using a portfolio of stoks from the London Stok Exhange FTSE100 index (FTSE),

we study both the time dependene of their orrelations and the normalized tree

length of the assoiated minimal spanning tree (MST). The (cid:28)rst four moments of

the distribution of orrelations and lengths of the tree are examined in detail and

di(cid:27)erenes in behaviour noted. For di(cid:27)erent eonomi groups and industries, lus-

tering is evident. However omparing the lassi(cid:28)ation used prior to 2006 with that

introdued in January 2006 it is lear that the new lassi(cid:28)ation, apart from one or

two notable exeptions, is muh more ompatible with the lustering obtained by

the MST analysis. We (cid:28)nally ompare the MST for real data with that obtained

for a syntheti random market. The latter tree would seem more like the struture

found by Coronnello et al. for trees based on high frequeny data.

Key words: Eonophysis, minimal spanning trees, setor analysis, stok

orrelations, random time series.

Introdution

During the past deade, many physiists have used tehniques of statistial

physis and omplexity to study eonomi and (cid:28)nanial problems [1,2℄ and the

assoiated networks [3℄. Networks play a ruial role in these systems simply

beause trading ativity generates networks. Studying stok networks, where

the links represent similarities between stoks, an prove very valuable for

portfolio optimization [4,5℄.

A hallenging problem is the nature of stok time series and, in partiular, the

nature of their randomness [5,6,7℄. Reently the theory of random matries

has proved helpful to haraterize the time series [8,9℄. In this paper we use

the onept of a minimal spanning tree (MST) proposed by Mantegna [10℄, to

examine the orrelations for stoks from the London FTSE100 index.

We review brie(cid:29)y the method in the next setion and explain how we hoose

the time parameters in Setion 3. In Setion 4, we use the approah to examine

a portfolio of stoks seleted from the London FTSE100 index. In Setion 5, we

examine in more detail the results for individual stok setors. For di(cid:27)erent

eonomi groups and industries, lustering derived in Setion 4 is evident.

However omparing in Setion 6 the lassi(cid:28)ation used prior to 2006 with that

introdued in January 2006 it is lear that the new lassi(cid:28)ation, apart from

one or two notable exeptions, is muh more ompatible with the lustering

obtained by the MST analysis. We (cid:28)nally ompare in Setion 7 the MST for

real data with that obtained for a syntheti random and lose with a few

onlusions.

2 De(cid:28)nitions

Our main goal is to detet any underlying struture of a portfolio, suh as

lustering, or identi(cid:28)ation of key stoks. We start by omputing the orre-

lation oe(cid:30)ient between time series of log-returns of pairs of stoks. From

these orrelations we an ompute a distane, for eah pair, whih is used for

the onstrution of a network with links between stoks.

The 100 most highly apitalized ompanies in the UK that omprise the Lon-

don FTSE100, represent approximately 80% of the UK market. From these
100 stoks, we study the time series of the daily losing prie of N = 67 stoks
that have been in the index ontinuously over a period of almost 9 years,
starting in 2nd
June 2005. This equals 2322 trading

August 1996 until 27th

days per stok. For our analysis of the time dependene of orrelations and

distanes, time series are divided in small time windows, eah with width T ,

that will overlap eah other. The total number of windows depends on the

window step length parameter, δT .

2.1 Correlations

The orrelation oe(cid:30)ient, ρij between stoks i and j is given by:

ρij =

hRiRji − hRiihRji
i i − hRii2)

hR2
(cid:16)

j i − hRji2

(cid:17)

(hR2

r

2

(1)

where Ri is the vetor of the time series of log-returns, Ri(t) = ln Pi(t) −
ln Pi(t − 1) the log-return and Pi(t) the daily losure prie of stok i at day
t. The notation h· · ·i means an average over time
· · ·, where t is the
(cid:28)rst day and T is the length of our time series.

t+T −1
t′=t

P

1
T

This oe(cid:30)ient an vary between −1 ≤ ρij ≤ 1, where −1 means ompletely
anti-orrelated stoks and +1 ompletely orrelated stoks. If ρij = 0 the
stoks i and j are unorrelated. The oe(cid:30)ients form a symmetri N × N

matrix with diagonal elements equal to unity.

Following Onnela et al. [5,11℄, we analyse the distribution of orrelations in

time. The (cid:28)rst moment is the mean orrelation:

2

ρ =

N(N − 1) Xi<j

ρij

Other moments are similarly de(cid:28)ned, the variane:

λ2 =

2

N(N − 1) Xi<j

(ρij − ρ)2,

the skewness:

λ3 =

2
N(N − 1)λ3/2

2 Xi<j

(ρij − ρ)3,

and the kurtosis:

λ4 =

2
N(N − 1)λ2

2 Xi<j

(ρij − ρ)4.

Evaluation of these moments for time windows of width T reveals the dynamis

of the time series. The higher moments explain how the variane of orrelation

oe(cid:30)ients inrease or derease and how the skewness and kurtosis of the

distribution hanges. As we will see in Setion 4, these moments show di(cid:27)erent

behaviour after rashes or (cid:28)nanial days with signi(cid:28)ant news.

2.2 Distanes

The metri distane, introdued by Mantegna [10℄, is determined from the

Eulidean distane between vetors, dij = | ˜Ri − ˜Rj|. Here, the vetors

˜Ri

3

(2)

(3)

(4)

(5)

are omputed from Ri by subtrating the mean and dividing by the standard

deviation:

˜Ri =

Ri− < Ri >
i i − hRii2
hR2

q

Using the de(cid:28)nition of orrelation oe(cid:30)ient (eq. 1), ρij = ˜Ri · ˜Rj and noting
that | ˜Ri| = 1 it follows that:

ij = | ˜Ri − ˜Rj|2 = | ˜Ri|2 + | ˜Rj|2 − 2 ˜Ri · ˜Rj = 2 − 2ρij
d2

This relates the distane of two stoks to their orrelation oe(cid:30)ient:

dij =

2(1 − ρij)

q

This distane varies between 0 ≤ dij ≤ 2 where small values imply strong

orrelations between stoks.

Following the proedure of Mantegna [10℄, this distane matrix is now used

to onstrut a network with the essential information of the market. This

network is a minimal spanning tree (MST) with N − 1 links onneting N

nodes. The nodes represent stoks and the links are hosen suh that the

sum of all distanes (normalized tree length) is minimal. We perform this

omputation using Prim's algorithm [12℄.

The normalized tree length, again following Onnela et al. [5,11℄, is given by

(6)

(7)

1

L =

N − 1 Xdij ∈Θ

dij

where Θ represents the MST. We also ompute its higher moments (variane,

skewness and kurtosis) and ompare with the equivalent moments of the or-

relations.

3 Determination of time parameters

Depending on the length of the time series, the orrelation oe(cid:30)ient between

two stoks hanges. Thus the distane between the two stoks will be di(cid:27)erent

and the MST onstruted will have di(cid:27)erent harateristis. In order to selet

appropriate values for the size of time windows (T ) and window step length
parameter (δT ) we looked at early studies in this (cid:28)eld. As shown previously

4

[5℄, the (cid:28)rst and seond moment of the orrelations (mean orrelation and

variane) are strongly orrelated. Taking this into aount, we omputed the

value of this orrelation as a funtion of T and δT (Figure 1).

(mean, eq. 2 and variane, eq. 3) as a funtion of T and δT . The left graphi shows the
orrelation for di(cid:27)erent T as funtion of δT . The right graphi shows the orrelation
for δT = 1, as funtion of T .

Clearly, for all T , the orrelation between the two moments is not only posi-
tive but strong, above 0.9 for T = 750, T = 1000 and T = 1250. Apart from
T = 250 and T = 1750 there are only very small (cid:29)utuations for the orre-
lation value, when we vary δT . Sine when we inrease δT , we are essentially
removing points from our data, we deided to use the smallest value of δT (1

day) in all of the following.

Some events suh as wars or rashes ourred during the period of study and

are noted in Figure 2 that shows the absolute return of the FTSE Index.

After these ourrenes, whih have a negative e(cid:27)et on stok values, all the

stoks seems to follow eah other, and both the orrelation between them

and mean orrelation inrease [13℄. Now even if the orrelation between mean

orrelation and variane inreases when we inrease T , the urve of mean
orrelation is based on less information. So the hoie of T beomes something
of a ompromise. We hoose T = 500 (2 years) and δT = 1 (1 day) to ompute

our moments for the orrelations and distanes.

4 Analysis of Global Portfolio of FTSE100 index

The time dependene of the mean orrelation, the normalized tree length

and the higher moments assoiated with these two quantities were studied

for a time window, T = 500 and window step length, δT = 1. Figure 3

shows that the mean and variane of the orrelation oe(cid:30)ients are highly

orrelated (0.779), the skewness and kurtosis are also highly orrelated and

the mean and skewness are anti-orrelated. This implies that when the mean

orrelation inreases, usually after some negative event in market, the variane

inreases. Thus the dispersion of values of the orrelation oe(cid:30)ient is higher.

The skewness is almost always positive, whih means that the distribution

is asymmetri, but after a negative event the skewness dereases, and the

distribution of the orrelation oe(cid:30)ients beomes more symmetri.

step length parameter δT = 1 day. For eah moment ((Ttotal − T )/δT =)1822 data

points are shown.

From Figure 4, we see how the normalized tree length hanges with time. As

expeted from equation 6, when the mean orrelation inreases, the normalized

tree length dereases and vie versa. Here, the mean and the variane of the

normalized length of the tree are anti-orrelated but the skewness and the

mean ontinue to be anti-orrelated. This means that after some negative

event impats the market, the tree shrinks, so the mean distane dereases [13℄,

the variane inreases implying a higher dispersion of the values of distane

and the skewness, that is almost always negative, inreases showing that the

distribution of the distanes of the MST gets more symmetri.

5 Setor Analysis

A study of stoks suh as the one onsidered here give us a insight into the

behavior with time of the market. A spei(cid:28) study of eah setor of the mar-

ket is also of interest. We have studied two di(cid:27)erent lassi(cid:28)ations. First we

onsider the old lassi(cid:28)ation for the London FTSE100, the FTSE Global Clas-

si(cid:28)ation System [14℄, that was in use from 2003 until the end of 2005. This

lassi(cid:28)ation groups the stoks into 102 Subsetors, 36 Setors and 10 Eo-
nomi Groups. Our portfolio is omposed of 9 eonomi groups and 27 setors:

Resoures (Mining, Oil & Gas), Basi Industries (Chemials, Constrution &

Building Materials), General Industrials (Aerospae & Defense), Non-ylial

Consumer Goods (Beverages, Food Produers & Proessors, Health, Personal

Care & Household Produts, Pharmaeutials & Biotehnology, Tobao),

Cylial Servies (General Retailers, Leisure & Hotels, Media & Entertain-

ment, Support Servies, Transport), Non-ylial Servies (Food & Drug Re-

tailers, Teleommuniation Servies), Utilities (Eletriity, Utilities-Others),

Finanials (Banks, Insurane, Life Assurane, Investment Companies, Real

8

Estate, Speiality & Other Finane) and Information Tehnology (Software &

Computer Servies).

The seond lassi(cid:28)ation studied is the new lassi(cid:28)ation adopted by FTSE

sine the beginning of 2006, the Industry Classi(cid:28)ation Benhmark [15℄ re-

ated by Dow Jones Indexes and FTSE. This lassi(cid:28)ation is divided into 10
Industries, 18 Supersetors, 39 Setors and 104 Subsetors. Our portfolio is
omposed of 10 industries and 28 setors: Oil & Gas (Oil & Gas Produers),

Basi Materials (Chemials, Mining), Industrials (Constrution & Materials,

Aerospae & Defense, General Industrials, Industrial Transportation, Support

Servies), Consumer Goods (Beverages, Food Produers, Household Goods,

Tobao), Health Care (Health Care Equipment & Servies, Pharmaeutials

& Biotehnology), Consumer Servies (Food & Drug Retailers, General Re-

tailers, Media, Travel & Leisure), Teleommuniations (Fixed Line Teleom-

muniations, Mobile Teleommuniations), Utilities (Eletriity, Gas Water

& Multiutilities), Finanials (Banks, Nonlife Insurane, Life Insurane, Real

Estate, General Finanial, Equity Investment Instruments, Nonequity Invest-

ment Instruments) and Tehnology (Software & Computer Servies).

For the old lassi(cid:28)ation, the four eonomi groups with more stoks are the

Non-ylial Consumer Goods (13), Cylial Servies (21), Non-ylial Ser-
vies (6) and Finanials (13). For eah one of these groups we have repeated

the above analysis of moments.

Looking at the mean orrelation, the Finanial group is muh more orrelated

than all the other groups. If we analyse the variane, the Finanial and Non-

ylial Servies groups loose the global property where the (cid:28)rst two moments

of the orrelation oe(cid:30)ients are orrelated.

For the new lassi(cid:28)ation, the four industries with more stoks are the Indus-

trials (10), Consumer Goods (9), Consumer Servies (18) and Finanials (13).

The mean and variane of the orrelation oe(cid:30)ients for these industries are

presented in Figure 7.

6 Minimal Spanning Trees

For a topologial view of the market we plot the MST with all the nodes

(stoks) and links between them (distanes). For eah lassi(cid:28)ation we analyse

the luster formation of di(cid:27)erent eonomi groups (FTSE Global Classi(cid:28)ation

System) or industries (ICB).

Starting with the analysis due to the old lassi(cid:28)ation we represent eah eo-

nomi group by a di(cid:27)erent symbol: Resoures ((cid:4)), Basi Industries (△), Gen-
eral Industrials ((cid:7)), Non-ylial Consumer Goods ((cid:3)), Cylial Servies (N),

10

Non-ylial Servies (♦), Utilities (•), Finanials (gray ◦) and Information
Tehnology (◦).

Figure 8, shows the MST with lusters of spei(cid:28) eonomi groups. Stoks

from the Finanial group are the bakbone of this tree. It seems that all

the other groups are onneted to this one. The Finanials, Resoures, Utili-

ties and General Industrials groups have all their stoks onneted together.

However for other groups divisions of stoks in setors are apparent. For ex-

ample, in the Non-ylial Servies, the Food & Drug Retailers are ompletely

separated from the Teleommuniation Servies. Within Cylial Servies, the

General Retailers, Media & Entertainment and Transports are 3 di(cid:27)erent lus-

ters and the Support Servies are isolated stoks onneted to the Finanial

branh. In Non-ylial Consumer Goods, the Health and Pharmaeutials &

Biotehnology form one luster whereas Beverages, Tobao, Food Produers

& Proessors and Personal Care & Household Produts form another.

Figure 8. Minimal Spanning Tree for the FTSE100 stoks. The length of the time

series used to ompute this tree is 2322 days. Eah symbol orrespond to a spei(cid:28)

eonomi group from the FTSE Global Classi(cid:28)ation System.

For the new lassi(cid:28)ation, we represent eah industry by a symbol: Oil & Gas

((cid:4)), Basi Materials (△), Industrials ((cid:7)), Consumer Goods (gray (cid:3)), Health
Care ((cid:3)), Consumer Servies (N), Teleommuniations (♦), Utilities (•), Fi-
nanials (gray ◦) and Tehnology (◦). The MST is represented in Figure 9.

The Finanial industry has the same stoks as the one in the old lassi(cid:28)ation,

so it still works as the bakbone of the tree. Finanials, Oil & Gas, Utilities,

Teleommuniations and Consumer Goods have all their stoks onneted to-

gether. In the Consumer Servies, the supersetors Retail and Media are two

big lusters but they are not onneted together. The other supersetor from

11

this industry, the Travel & Leisure is disperse in the tree. Health Care indus-

try is almost one luster, but the stok SHP is not onneted to the others.

In the Industrials industry the stoks from the Support Servies setor are

always onneted to the Finanial industry. The other stoks in this setor are

loated in isolation at other points within the tree.

Figure 9. Minimal Spanning Tree for the FTSE100 stoks. The length of the time

series used to ompute this tree is 2322 days. Eah symbol orrespond to a spei(cid:28)

industry from the ICB.

The new lassi(cid:28)ation adopted by FTSE in January 2006 learly mimis muh

more losely the MST results as we an see from Figures 8 and 9. The imple-

mentation of the new supersetor groups ensures that apart from some notable

exeptions stoks from the same supersetor are now onneted. It is possible

that the few stoks separated from their main luster are isolated by hane

and over time they will join the appropriate lusters. However there ould be

other more fundamental reasons for their separation. Further study of both

the dynamis of the MST orrelations together with their eonomi indies

(e.g. PE ratio, earnings, et) that haraterize the businesses onerned is

neessary to resolve these issues. Nevertheless it seems lear from this analysis

that the MST approah is one that should omplement urrent approahes to

the development of stok taxonomy.

Coronnello et al. [16℄ have studied the topology of the London FTSE using

daily and intra-day data for N = 92 stoks, from year 2002. The MST for

daily data looks quite di(cid:27)erent from the one shown in Figure 8. Using our

data and studying the MST for eah year, we an see that for 2002, the main

hubs of the MST are BARC, RBS and SHEL, eah of them with 11, 8 and 7

links, respetively. The simple inlusion of BARC in our study (not inluded

12

in the portfolio of [16℄) gives a quite di(cid:27)erent network. But the main lusters

are the same in the two studies.

7 Numerial Simulations of MST

In order to examine further the underlying nature of the time series we use

now random time series omputed from two di(cid:27)erent models. Modeling the

log-returns as random numbers from a spei(cid:28) distribution, we an ompute

the orrelations, distanes and trees for this random series. As in [6,7℄, our

(cid:28)rst approah was to onsider the returns as random variables derived from a

Gaussian distribution. So, using the real mean value, µi of eah real time series
and the spei(cid:28) real variane, σi we ompute random series for our random

market:

ri(t) = µi + ǫi(t)

where ǫi(t) is the stohasti variable from a Gaussian distribution with vari-
ane σi . The MST for this random time series is represented in Figure 10.

from a Gaussian distribution.

Pajek

This MST shows no lustering, the stoks are distributed randomly in the

network and there is no stok with more than 4 links. To reate random time

series with more real harateristis we introdue a ontrol term (the return

13

of FTSE Index) and we ompute a one-fator model [6,7℄:

ri(t) = αi + βiRm(t) + ǫi(t)

where αi and βi are parameters estimated by the least square method from
our data, Rm(t) is the market fator (return of FTSE Index) and ǫi(t) is the
stohasti variable from a Gaussian distribution with variane σi . The two

fators are alulated as:

αi = hRi(t)i − βihRM (t)i

βi =

cov(Ri(t), RM (t))
σ2
RM

where cov(. . . , . . .) is the ovariane, σ2
FTSE Index and Ri(t) is the returns of real stok i.

RM is the variane of the returns of

The MST for random time series reated using this model is shown in Figure

Figure 11. Minimal Spanning Tree for 67 random time series using the one-fator

model.

This network is ompletely di(cid:27)erent from the previous random network. Now

we see that the stoks from the Finanial group (gray ◦), are all linked together.

As in the MST for real data ((cid:28)gures 8 and 9) they at as the bakbone of the

network. However, the presene of 6 nodes with up to 13 links di(cid:27)ers from

the topology of real data. A model to desribe the time series of log-return

14

seems to lie somewhere between a ompletely random model and an one-

fator model. The ompletely random model does not give muh information.

However, apart from produing the Finanial group bakbone, the one-fator

model shows similar topology with the MST shown by Coronnello et al. [16℄

for intra-day data. This suggests that the network formed by intra-day data

are not fully formed, information as not yet su(cid:30)iently spread and orrelations

are not yet developed as they are found in the networks formed using daily

data.

8 Conlusions

In summary, we have studied the orrelations between time series of log-return

of stoks from a FTSE100 portfolio and examine how these hange with both

the size of the time series and time. The mean orrelation inreases after

external rises, and di(cid:27)erent moments feature orrelations or anti-orrelations

as a result. For the study of spei(cid:28) stoks of eah setor we onlude that

some setors have di(cid:27)erent feedbak to the external events.

From the MST we an see that some stoks from the same setor luster to-

gether. This does not happen with all stoks from spei(cid:28) eonomi groups or

industries. It would seem from the MST analysis that the new FTSE lassi(cid:28)-

ation introdued in January 2006 o(cid:27)ers a more logial lustering of the di(cid:27)er-

ent stoks as opposed to the previous lassi(cid:28)ation sheme. However from the

MST it is lear that anomalies are still present that ould a(cid:27)et the building

of optimum portfolios.

The struture of trees generated from random time series di(cid:27)ers signi(cid:28)antly

from real markets. Furthermore there appears to be no obvious hub node.

On the other hand the one-fator model produes a MST where we an see

hubs with many links. This kind of struture is lose to that obtained using

intra-day data. In future papers we shall assess hanges in the tree strutures

using one-fator model Levy distributions. We shall also look at this issue

by deriving analyti expressions linking the moments of orrelations to the

moments of the lengths.

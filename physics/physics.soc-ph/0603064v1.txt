Abstract

Our experience of web access slowing down is a consequence of the aggregated web access pattern of

web users. This is just one example among several human oriented services which are strongly affected by

human activity patterns. Recent empirical evidence is indicating that human activity patterns are character-

ized by power law distributions of inter-event times, where large ﬂuctuations rather than regularity is the

common case. I show that this temporal heterogeneity can be explained by two mechanisms: (i) humans

have some perception of their past activity rate and (ii) based on that they react by accelerating or reducing

their activity rate. Using these two mechanisms I explain the inter-event time statistics of Darwin’s and Ein-

stein’s correspondence and the email activity within an university environment. Moreover, they are typical

examples of the the accelerating and reducing class, respectively. These results are relevant to the system

design of human oriented services.

Human activity patterns are inherently stochastic at the single individual level. Understanding

this dynamics is crucial to design efﬁcient systems dealing with the aggregated activity of several

humans. A typical example is a call center design, where we save resources by taking into account

that all workers will no call or receive calls at the same time [1, 2]. There are several other

examples including the design of communication networks in general, web servers, road systems

and strategies to halt epidemic outbreaks [3, 4].

The stochasticity present in the human dynamics has been in general modeled by a Poisson

processes characterized by a constant rate of activity execution [1, 2, 3]. Generalizations to non-

stationary Poisson processes has also been considered taking into account the effects of seasonality

[5]. Yet, these approaches fail when confronted with recent empirical data for the inter-event time

statistics of different human activities [6, 7, 8, 9]. I show that the missing mechanism is a key

human attribute, memory.

I. THE MODEL

Consider an individual and an speciﬁc activity in which he/she is frequently involved, such as

sending emails. The chance that the individual execute that activity (event) at a given time depends

on the previous activity history. More precisely, (i) humans have a perception of their past activity

rate and (ii) based on that they react by accelerating or reducing their activity rate. Although it is

obvious that we remember what we have done it is more difﬁcult to quantify this perception. In a

ﬁrst approximation I assume that the perception of our past activity is given by the mean activity

rate. I also assume that based on this perception we then decide to accelerate or reduce our activity

rate. In mathematical terms this means that if λ(t)dt is the probability that the individual performs

the activity between time t and t + dt then

where the parameter a > 0 controls the degree and type of reaction to the past perception. When

λ(t) = a

a = 1 we obtain λ(t) = λ(0) and the process is stationary. On the other hand, when a 6= 0 the

process is non-stationary with acceleration (a > 0) or reduction (a < 1).

Implicitly in (1) is the assumption of an starting time (t = 0). For the case of daily activities

this can be taken as the time we wake up or we arrive to work. More generally it is a reﬂection

of our bounded memory, meaning that we do not remember or do not consider relevant what took

2

place before that time. For instance, we usually check for new emails every day after arriving at

work no matter what we did the day before.

Equation (1) can be solved for any a resulting in

λ(t) = λ0a

where λ0 is the mean number of events in the time period under consideration T . Due to the

stochastic nature of this process the inter-event time X between the two consecutive task execu-
tions is a random variable. We denote by F (τ ) = Prob (X < τ ) and f (τ ) = ˙F (τ ) the inter-event

distribution and probability density function, respectively. Within short time intervals λ(t) is ap-

proximately constant and the dynamics follows a Poisson process characterized by an exponential
distribution F (τ, λ(t)) = 1 − e−λ(t)τ . Furthermore, the mean fraction of events taking place within

this short time interval is λ(t)dt/λ0T . Integrating over the whole time period we ﬁnally obtain

II. COMPARISON WITH EMPIRICAL DATA

To check the validity of our predictions we analyze the regular mail correspondence of Darwin

and Einstein [8] and an email dataset containing the email exchange among 3,188 users in an

university environment for a period of three months [10].

Regular mail: In Fig. 1a we plot the cumulative number letters sent by Darwin and Einstein

as a function of time, measured from the moment the ﬁrst letter was recorded. In both cases we

observe a growth tendency faster than linear, which is well approximated by the power law growth
0 dt′λ(t′) this observation corresponds with a letter sending rate (2)
R
with a = 3.7. Furthermore, both Darwin and Einstein sent more than 6,000 letters during the time

t

period considered by this dataset. In this case (a > 1, τ0 ≪ T ) we predict that the inter-event

time distribution follows the power law behavior (6) with α ≈ 2.4 ± 0.1 (7). This prediction is

confronted in Fig. 1b with the inter-event time obtained from the correspondence data, revealing

a very good agreement.

Email: Determining the time dependency of λ(t) is more challenging for the email data. If

we restrict our analysis to single users there are only 21 users that sent more than 500 emails.

Among them a few sent more than 1,000 emails but it is questionable how well they represent the

average email user. Therefore, for about 99% of the users we do not count with sufﬁcient data

to make conclusions about their individual behavior, being force to analyze their aggregated data.

Furthermore, email activity patterns are strongly affected by the circadian rhythm (T = 1 day)

and therefore we can also aggregate data obtained for different days. In Fig. 2a we plot the email

sending rate averaged over different days and over all users in the dataset as a function of time.

The characteristic features of this plot are: an abrupt increase following the start of the working

hours, two maximums corresponding with the morning and afternoon activity peaks and a ﬁnal

decay associated with the end of the working hours.

It is important to note that large inter-event times are associated with low values of λ. Therefore,

the decrease in the email sending rate after the working hours determines the tail of the inter-event

time distribution. Based on this we predict that the email activity belongs to the rate reduction class

(a < 1). Furthermore, in average each user sends an email every two days. In this case (a > 1,

τ0 < T ) we predict that the inter-event time distribution should exhibit a power law behavior (8)

with 0 < α < 1 (9). This prediction is conﬁrmed by the empirical data for the inter-event time

distribution (see Fig. 2b) resulting in α = 0.9 ± 0.1.

III. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

This work should not be confused with a recent model introduced by Barab´asi to characterize

the statics of response times [6]. The response or waiting time should not be confused with the

inter-event time. For instance, in the context of email activity the response time is the time interval

between the arrival of an email to our Inbox and the time we answer that particular email. On

the other hand, the inter-event time is the time interval between to consecutive emails independent

of the recipient. For practical applications such as the design of call centers, web servers, road

systems and strategies to halt epidemic outbreaks the relevant magnitude is the inter-event time.

I have shown that acceleration/reduction tendencies together with some perception of our past

activity rate (1) are sufﬁcient elements to explain the power law inter-event time distributions

observed in two empirical datasets. Regarding the regular mail correspondence of Darwin and

Einstein the acceleration is probably due to the increase of their popularity over time. In the case

5

of the email data the rate reduction could have different origins. We could stop checking emails

because we should do something else or because after we check for new emails the likelihood that

we do it again decreases. The second alternative has a psychological origin, associated with our

expectation that new emails will not arrive shortly. In practice, the reduction rate of sending emails

may be a combination of these two and factors.

In a more general perspective this work indicates that a minimal model to characterize human

activity patterns is given by two factors: (i) humans have a perception of their past activity rate and

(ii) based on that they react by accelerating or reducing their activity rate. From the mathematical

point of view memory implies that the progression of the activity rate is described by integral

equations. This is the key element leading to the power law behavior. These results are relevant to

other human activities where power law inter-event time distributions have been observed [7, 9].

Before making any general statement, further research is required to test the validity of the model

assumptions case by case.

(a) Email sending rate average over 81 days and 3,188 users as a function of time. The time was shift by

a constant such that the start of the working hours corresponds approximately with hour zero. We observe

two local maximums associated with the morning and afternoon peaks of daily activity. More importantly,

this initial relatively high activity is followed by a reducing tendency.

(b) Aggregated inter-event time

distribution of all users. The open circles are obtained considering both intra-day and inter-day inter-events,

where we can note a local maximum at one day. The solid line represents the power law decay f (τ ) ∼ τ −α

with α = 0.9. The solid squares are obtained considering intra-day inter-events only showing that the power

law behavior is determined by intra-day emails.

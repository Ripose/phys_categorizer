Abstract

We investigate the optimal strategy over a ﬁnite time horizon for a portfolio of stock and bond and a
derivative in an multiplicative Markovian market model with transaction costs (friction). The optimiza-
tion problem is solved by a Hamilton-Bellman-Jacobi equation, which by the veriﬁcation theorem has
well-behaved solutions if certain conditions on a potential are satisﬁed. In the case at hand, these con-
ditions simply imply arbitrage-free (“Black-Scholes”) pricing of the derivative. While pricing is hence
not changed by friction allow a portfolio to ﬂuctuate around a delta hedge. In the limit of weak friction,
we determine the optimal control to essentially be of two parts: a strong control, which tries to bring the
stock-and-derivative portfolio towards a Black-Scholes delta hedge; and a weak control, which moves
the portfolio by adding or subtracting a Black-Scholes hedge. For simplicity we assume growth-optimal
investment criteria and quadratic friction.

Introduction

An idealised model of investment is a sequence of gambles where an investor at each time step decides
if to re-balance his investments, and, if so, by how much. The game is multiplicative if the pay-off is
proportional to capital, and Markov if the new capital and new position only depend on the previous state
and the action taken then. In two previous contributions [1, 2] we computed the strategy an investor should
use to maximize the growth rate of his wealth, in the presence of transaction costs, if she can invest in stock
and bonds. In this paper we extend the investment possibilities to also include a derivative security, e.g.
an option on the stock. Optimizing the total portfolio leads to pricing and hedging of derivatives in this
context. In the friction-less case, an investment in Black-Scholes delta hedge is equivalent to a bond. The
optimal investment strategy is hence degenerate, consisting of the optimal amount allocated to stock in the

1

absence of derivative, plus an arbitrary amount invested in a delta hedge. We show here that friction lifts
this degeneracy.

The main mathematical tool is the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, which leads to time-dependent
controls, as in [2] (without derivative). A derivative makes the optimization problem in general ill-deﬁned,
unless the price process obeys a solvability criterion, known as the veriﬁcation theorem in the mathematical
theory of controlled stochastic processes [7]. In Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman language, the value function is
potentially unbounded, because the number of variables that can be controlled (the positions in stock and
derivative) is larger than the number of independent noise sources. In the case at hand, the potential is the
expected utility of the portfolio as a function of the fraction of wealth invested in stock and derivative, and
the conditions simply imply arbitrage-free (“Black-Scholes”) pricing of the derivative.

While we hence ﬁnd that pricing does not depend on market friction, the optimal investment strategy
does. Qualitatively speaking, we determine the optimal control to be of two parts: a strong control, which
tries to bring the stock-and-derivative portfolio close to a Black-Scholes delta hedge; and a weak control,
which moves the portfolio by adding or subtracting a Black-Scholes hedge. The rationale for the presence
of the weak control is that the strong control acts to oppose the underlying diffusion of the portfolio, in the
direction normal to the delta hedge. The larger that diffusion, the higher will be the average friction costs,
per unit time. It is therefore advantageous to invest as much in the delta hedge to make the diffusion in the
normal direction as small as possible.

A technical contribution in this paper is that we introduce a multi-scale expansion around the friction-
less limit. Since we have two independent variables under control (the stock and the derivative), we can
have different scales in two different directions. In fact, we will show that in the weak-noise limit there
is a fast control direction, and a slow control direction. The fast control strives to bring the portfolio to
an optimal stock portfolio plus a Black-Scholes hedge. Financially, this means that an optimal investment
strategy is to hold some amount in stock, and then some number of fully hedged derivatives. That number
is however controlled on a longer time scale, by the slow control. Two limit cases are of interest. First, far
from expiry a derivative is not much different from stock, and the situation is similar to only investing in
stock and bonds. Second we can also deal with the situation close to expiry. There, the best strategy turns
out to be to hold little funds proportional to the Black-Scholes hedge, i.e. to avoid derivatives in the optimal
strategy. This concurs with the practice of closing out positions in derivatives before expiry.

For simplicity we work in this paper with quadratic friction. These can be motivated as an effective
description of market impact (see e.g. [6]). The reader is referred to [2] for details. Linear friction costs,
arguably more realistic, lead to free boundary problems in the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman formalism, which
are considerably harder, from the analytical and numerical point of view. For more details on linear friction,
see [3] (forthcoming).

For simplicity we will also furthermore assume throughout that an investor strives to optimize expected
growth of capital, which in a multiplicative market model means logarithmic utility. Growth optimal strate-
gies were ﬁrst introduced by Kelly in the context of information theory [11]. Growth-optimal strategies
have the well-known property of eventually, for long times, outperforming any other strategy with proba-
bility one ([9] and references therein), but do not maximize vanilla-ﬂavored utility functions, see e.g. [5].
In the present context, logarithmic utilities should merely be looked upon a deﬁnite and convenient choice,
which brings some mathematical tidiness.

The paper is organised as follows. In section 2 we state the model (without derivative), and the controls
we consider. We state the optimisation problem in the framework of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation.
In section 4 we show that the non-linear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation governing the dynamics, in our
example, is solvable in the small transaction costs limit by means of a multi-scale perturbation theory
(see for example [4], or [8], chapter 9). This is the main technical result of the paper, and reduces the
non-linearity to a normal form. All higher order corrections can be computed from ancillary linear non-
homogeneous equations.
In section 6 we solve analytically the normal form of the non-linearity. The
approximation turns out to be very accurate for realistic values of the parameters in the model. The last
section is devoted to a discussion of the results.

2 Bond, stock and derivatives

In this section we deﬁne notation, and state the problem. The market consists of a risk-less security (bond,
or bank account) and a risky security (stock). By a change of numeraire we take the price of the risk-free
security to be constant in time. The stock price is taken the standard log-normal process:

ψt+dt = ψt (1 + µdt + σdBt)

Here dBt denotes the stochastic differential and µ and σ are positive constants. Nothing in the following
analysis would essentially change if µ and σ would be functions of t and St, as long as the market is still
complete, see e.g. [10]. Consider now ﬁrst a portfolio in only stock and bond. The control variable then is
the fraction of wealth an investor has invested in stock:

ρt =

W Stocks
t
Wt

dρcontrol
t

= f dt

This variable changes both in result to market ﬂuctuation, i.e. (1), and re-hedging. We assume that a control
can be executed of the form

and doing so carries a cost

where F is a semi-positive deﬁnite functional of the stochastic control. The form of F models the transac-
tion costs.

(cid:2)

For a derivation of these equations, see [2]. The time-dependent growth-optimization problem, of a stock
(cid:3)
and bond portfolio, from time t to some ﬁnal time T , is simply to choose the control f such that the
expected value of log WT
is maximized. By a change of variable, this is equivalent to maximizing the
Wt
expectation value, over the controlled diffusion process, of a potential (utility function) depending on ρ and
f . Implicitly, we assume unbounded borrowing at the risk-less rate, and no restrictions on going short.
These are not in fact serious limitations, because the optimal solution, with transaction costs, is to hold the
fraction invested in stock close the optimal value of µ
σ2 , see [1], which is ﬁnite. In the main body of this
paper, we will use quadratic friction costs, i.e. F (f ) = f 2, for a discussion of linear friction costs, see [1]
and [3] [forthcoming].

Let us deﬁne a derivative security as a third investment possibility, the price of which, C(ψt, t), only

depends on the moment of time t and the price of stock. The price dynamics of the derivative is

Let now as before the fraction invested in stock be ρ with control f , and the fraction invested in derivative

Furthermore, the probability density is in general non-autonomous as µd and σd may depend explicitly upon
the time variable. The problem is now to ﬁnd controls f and fd that maximize the logarithmic growth.

3 The veriﬁcation principle and Black-Scholes

It is useful to ﬁrst discuss the friction-less case. We will then just reproduce standard elementary results
in ﬁnance, but in a formulation convenient for the following discussion. Without transaction costs, the
speculator is free to rehedge continuously. In such a case the optimisation problem is equivalent to ﬁnding
the supremum, at any instance of time, of the instantaneous growth rate

investment fraction in the stock-and-bond problem. When (27) holds true any dynamics along the marginal
subspace does not produce any gain or loss. That means we can invest ρ W (in value) in stock and

4 Hamilton-Bellman-Jacobi problem for analytic transaction costs

The use of analytic transaction costs renders the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman problem simpler to study. In the
frame of reference ﬁxed by the eigenvectors of the Hessian of the utility function, the stochastic dynamics
is governed by the system of stochastic differential equations

dW = W [µζ dt + σζ dBt]

Equation (49) contains in principle the solution to our problem. The expected capital growth rate λ deter-
mines the stochastic controls through (48). Qualitative and quantitative analyses of the control strategies
are pursued in sections 5 and 6 below.

The Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation should be supplemented by boundary conditions on λ. Ar-
guably, the most natural would be to additionally assume that the process is conﬁned to some domain, and
hence that the normal gradient of λ vanishes on the boundaries of that domain. For the rest of this paper,
we will be concerned with a description close to the optimum. We will hence assume that the boundaries
are far away, that the probability is there small, and that we will not need to further specify the boundary
conditions.

5 Qualitative analysis of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation

Qualitatively, one can imagine the following scenario. As the utility changes with the position along the
stable direction, one may postulate a fast control along that direction, striving to bring the position close
to the marginal. Depending on where one is along the marginal, there would then be different (expected)
transaction costs in keeping the position in the stable direction close to zero. Hence, all positions along
the marginal are not equivalent, because they lead to different (expected) transaction costs in the stable
direction. In fact, we can then posit that the preferred position along the marginal is such that bζ of (40),
evaluated at

ζ ⋆ =

µ
σ2

is as small as possible. Since this function is linear in the marginal coordinate (see below), we then have
a prescription for the optimum allocation into a Black-Scholes hedge, as function of time and price of the
underlying

right hand side of (52) can also be rewritten as

Note that the time variation of the derivative price is usually denoted in the ﬁnancial literature by the Greek
letter Θ. The relations satisﬁed by the derivative-Θ with other commonly used ﬁnancial indicators as the
derivative ∆ and Γ are recalled in appendix B. The condition

in the original variables, i.e. the fractions invested in stock and derivative:

A consequence of these equations is that if σd diverges, ρ⋆ stays ﬁnite, while η⋆ tends to zero (θ⋆ diverges
as σd). This happens for European Call Options close to expiry and at-the-money (see appendix, σd is then
proportional to the “Greek” ∆, and inversely proportional to the option price C). Following Black-Scholes
hedging directly can then lead to large transaction costs, because of “portfolio ﬂapping” (switching between
the fully hedged and totally unhedged positions in response to small changes in the underlying). We see that
from the perspective of optimal investment strategies, this problem does not appear, since such portfolios
do not contain any at-the-money options close to expiry.

In the opposite limit of a large investment horizon, the derivative volatility tends to the volatility of the

underlying. Furthermore the inequality

holds true requiring increasingly large investments in derivatives in order to enforce (55). In such limit
the optimal size of the investment in stocks is also seen to diverge. The reason is that the drift (39) and
diffusion amplitude (40) along the stable direction become independent of the marginal direction if the
inﬁnite horizon limit is taken for any arbitrary ﬁnite value of θ. In particular (39), (40) become in the
portfolio variable ζ identical to the drift and diffusion amplitude felt in the stock and bond model studied in
[2]. These phenomena indicate a break-down of the argument used to derive (55). Qualitatively one expects
in this second limit the optimal investment strategy to treat the stock and the derivative in a similar manner
analogous to the one depicted in [2].

6 Systematic analysis of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation

In this section we will use a systematic multi-scale analysis to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. We
will show that the previous qualitative analysis is well founded. Furthermore, we are also able to treat the
case when the (putative) optimal position θ⋆ diverges, and, more generally, we can compute the control to
be exerted on ζ and θ. Nevertheless, the main interest here is conceptual, that the previous analysis can be
systematically justiﬁed.

To start with it is convenient to write the logarithmic growth in the form

−
The ﬁrst term corresponds to growth in the absence of transaction costs. The intensity of transaction costs
is then measured by the two adimensional parameters

We introduce “slower” variables in the perturbative expansion for the following reason. A general feature
of the expansion we are considering is that lower order approximate solutions enter the linear partial dif-
ferential equations governing higher order ones in the form of non-homogeneous terms. By Fredholm’s
alternative it follows that the perturbative expansion is consistent if and only if these non-homogeneous
term have no overlap with kernel of the linear differential operator associated to the homogeneous part of
the equations. According to the standard multiscale method (see for example [4]) slower variables can be
used to enforce the consistency conditions. The hierarchy of perturbative equations starts with

The logarithimc growth λ attains a maximum for z equal to zero corresponding to the optimal portfolio in
the absence of transaction costs. The value of this maximum deﬁnes the growth rate of the investor capital.
It is straightforward to verify that the conditions (55), (56) specify the supremum for the growth rate of the
investor capital. The overall logarithmic growth becomes in such a limit

(72)

The qualitative conclusion that can be inferred from (72) is that the inclusion in the optimal portfolio of a
derivative product quells the effect of transaction costs from the capital growth rate.

11

The mathematical conditions for the validity of the asymptotic expression (72) of the logarithmic growth
are determined by (57). The corresponding portfolio is well deﬁned close to maturity and for values of the
underlying price close to the strike price, when the volatility of the derivative price becomes very large. It
is also worth stressing that the asymptotics (72) holds true for values of z sufﬁciently small that the effect
of the boundary conditions can be neglected:

z

1

≪

(73)

The reasoning allowing to derive the asymptotics (72) from (71) breaks down in the large investment horizon
limit as discussed at the end of section 5. Namely in such a limit the terms proportional to ϑ⋆ in (65) vanish,
leaving with an equation in the portfolio variable z of the same form of the one describing the investment
strategy in the absence of derivatives the solution whereof was studied in [2].

The analysis of the intermediate dynamical regime between maturity and large horizon requires to take
into account the boundary conditions associated to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation (49) and is be-
yond the scope of this paper.

7.1 Corrections to the leading order

Inspection of (66) shows that it is consistent to set

with φ(0) independent of the ﬁrst set of slower variables. Hence the ﬁrst non-trivial correction to (72) turns
out to be of the order O(ε1+2/8φ(2)) as in the case of a market model without derivative products [2].

φ(1) = 0

(74)

8 Conclusions

We have shown that optimum investment strategies in a portfolio of stocks, bond and a derivative can be
determined by Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman techniques. Black-Scholes equation appears as a solvability con-
dition for the problem to be well-founded. Optimal strategies can be described as “fuzzy Black-Scholes”:
if transaction costs are small, optimal portfolios are not far from Black-Scholes delta hedges.

We believe it of conceptual interest that Black-Scholes pricing emerges as a solvability condition for an
ensemble of possible investment strategies. Hence, Black-Scholes has been motivated in a weaker setting,
where there is no replicating portfolio. Second, we have shown that expected transaction costs can be low-
ered by choosing between investments in both stocks and derivatives, and not only in stock. This is not
surprising, but the point has not previously been made previously by systematic analysis, to our best knowl-
edge. We note that the qualitative analysis can be extended to the case of several derivatives on the same
stock. Although there is a “law of diminishing returns”, expected transaction costs can then be lowered
further.

Finally we have made explicit the optimal fraction invested in derivatives in terms of the standard ﬁnan-

cial “Greeks”.

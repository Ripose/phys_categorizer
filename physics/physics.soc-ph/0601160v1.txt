Abstract: The bit-string model of Schulze and Stauﬀer (2005) is applied
to non-equilibrium situations and then gives better agreement with the em-
pirical distribution of language sizes. Here the size is the number of peo-
ple having this language as mother tongue. In contrast, when equilibrium
is combined with irreversible mutations of languages, one language always
dominates and is spoken by at least 80 percent of the population.

1 Introduction

Computer simulations of languages have a long tradition [1, 2], particularly
for the learning of one language [3, 4]. More recent is the simulation of the
extinction of old and the emergence of new languages [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,
12]. To explain the coexistence of 104 present human languages, the bit-
string model of Schulze and Stauﬀer [13], continued in [14], is particularly
convenient for simulation since with 8 or 16 bits it simulates 28 = 256 or
216 = 65536 diﬀerent languages (or diﬀerent grammars). Also the model of
de Oliveira et al [12] allows for numerous languages, but does not allow for

1

the distinction of equilibrium from non-equilibrium which the present note
concentrates on.

One of the open questions of linguistics is, whether the present distribu-
[15]) is similar to those of ancient past and
tion of human languages (e.g.
distant future, or whether it merely presents a transition between a past mul-
titude of languages and a future paucity: Every ten days on average a human
language dies out, and in Brazil already half the indigeneous languages were
replaced during the last half millenium by Portuguese. On the other hand,
national languages like Hebrew for Israel were resurrected, and Francophones
in Quebec ﬁght for the survival of their French as oﬃcial language in all of
Quebec; a continuous, albeit slow, addition of languages takes place by the
drifting apart of dialects.

We leave it to others to separate languages from dialects, and follow
standard statistics [16], as cited in [15], for the present language sizes. The
size s of a language is deﬁned as the number of people speaking it as mother
language, and varies from 109 for Mandarin Chinese down to 1 for the last
surviving speaker of a dying language. The number ns of languages with s
speakers each follows roughly a log-normal distribution,

log[ns/nsmax] ∝ −[log(s) − log(smax)]2

,

where smax is the language size which appears most often.
In a double-
logarithmic plot of log ns versus log s such data follow a parabola with a
maximum at smax. Sutherland [17] pointed out that for small sizes below 10
the observed number of languages is higher than the log-normal distribution,
and our Fig.1 shows these data.

Past simulations of the bit-string model of Schulze and Stauﬀer [13]
showed this desired log-normal distribution with upward deviations for the
smallest sizes, but s seldomly exceeded 100 or 1000. The model of [12] gave
much larger s but in our simulations gave two power laws instead of one log-
normal distribution. We now try two modiﬁcations, of which one worked, in
the next section.

2 Computer Model

The model symbolizes each language as a string of 16 bits, each of which
can be up (1) or down (0) and may represent some important aspect of the
grammar. Simulations with less or more bits, or with more than two choices

by factors of two; for example, all languages with sizes from 64 to 127 were
summed up into one data point. Binning by factors ten gives smoother data

for each grammatical feature, were also made but gave qualitatively similar
results. Languages are deﬁned as diﬀerent if they diﬀer in at least one bit.

At birth, the child adopts the mother language, apart from a possible
modiﬁcation (”mutation”, reversal of one bit). Adults speaking a rare lan-
guage may switch to a more widespread language. After a few hundred time
steps a dynamic equilibrium is established where the deaths roughly cancel
the births and the size distribution no longer changes systematically. In this
equilibrium we either have a dominance of one language spoken by at least
3/4 of the total population, or the fragmentation of the population into up
to 65536 diﬀerent languages of roughly equal sizes. The choice depends on
parameters and initial conditions. More details are given in the appendix.

One time step or iteration means that each individual individual is up-

dated once: switching languages, giving birth, dying. In a comparison with
reality, a ”person” may correspond to a whole line of ancestors and oﬀspring
since one iteration may correspond to several centuries for the present mu-
tation rates. A proper scaling of probabilities in order to allow one iteration
to correspond to arbitrary time intervals still needs to be done.

Modiﬁcation A is very simple: ”Irreversibility”. Bits may be changed
from 0 to 1 but never from 1 to 0. In this case, language 1111111111111111
(i.e. all 16 bits set to 1) plays a special role since it never changes. Lan-
guages rarely change from state A to state B and then back again. For some
phenomena this may happen, e.g., word order, but irreversibility is more
common, for instance as concerns phonological changes.

Modiﬁcation B is ”Nonequilibrium with noise”. We look not at the late
times of equilibrium but at the earlier times, and average over an extended

or from dominance to fragmentation. Now we have one more important pa-
rameter, the observation time, and we adjust it such that the results approx-
imate a log-normal distribution.

Noise is included as random multiplicative: At each iteration, each lan-
guage size s is ten times multiplied by a factor selected randomly between
0.9 and 1.1, with diﬀerent factors for each of the ten diﬀerent multiplica-
tions. This noise incorporates changing pressures to use various languages;
for example if the present authors would have reported this work a century
ago they presumably would not have written it in English. The noise also
approximates the changes in birth rates, migrations, ethnic intermarriage,
etc. due to external inﬂuences.

In both cases we select the initial population such that apart from minor

ﬂuctuations it agrees with the equilibrium population.

3 Results

Modiﬁcation A (irreversibility) always resulted in dominance even if we started
with fragmentation. Depending on the mutation probability, the end result
was everybody speaking the same language (usually the one with 16 bits
set to 1), or with between 80 and 100 percent of the people speaking one
language and the others distributed among many other languages. None of
these two choices is what we want: Mandarin Chinese is spoken by only one
sixth of the human population.

Modiﬁcation B (non-equilibrium with noise) gave Fig.2 if we start with
fragmentation: The whole population is randomly distributed among the

6

65536 languages. For increasing population size we get larger languages and
better results, but the shape of the curves does not change much. Figure 3
shows for two million people the rather minor eﬀects of changing mutation
rates, between 0.0002 and 0.002 per bit or 0.0032 and 0.032 per bit-string.
The tails at the right end depend strongly on when we stopped the simulation
and are anyhow far below the numbers (relative to the maximum) seen in
reality, Fig.1.

If we start with dominance, i.e. everybody speaks language zero, we need
a larger mutation rate to get fragmentation; Fig.4 shows again log-normal
distributions for various total population sizes, but now the left part near
the maximum looks like the corresponding right part near the maximum.
Reality, Fig.1, shows enhanced numbers in the left part, and this left-right
asymmetry is visible in Figs.2 and 3, not in Fig.4. Thus while Figs.2 and
3 may correspond to the present shrinking of language diversity, Fig.4 may
average over the times shortly before and after the biblical story of the Tower
of Babel.

4 Conclusion

Figure 2 for modiﬁcation B shows that with non-equilibrium and random
multiplicative noise we got the desired roughly log-normal distribution with
an enhanced number of languages for small sizes, just as in present reality,
Fig.1. This is an argument in favor of regarding the present language sizes as
a transient phenomenon between past fragmentation and future dominance.
But since it is only a computer model, it does not prove that in the future
everybody will speak Mandarin Chinese and its mutants.

We thank J. Jost for initiating this cooperation, and M. Cysouw for sug-

gestions which lead to modiﬁcation A.

5 Appendix: The old bit-string model

Our simulation model in general is based on three probabilities p, q, r for
change, for transfer, and for ﬂight from small languages. A language (perhaps
better: a grammar) is deﬁned as a chain of F features (4 ≤ F ≤ 64) each
of which can take one of Q diﬀerent values 1, 2, . . . , Q with 2 ≤ Q ≤ 10.
The binary case Q = 2 allows memory-saving representation as bit-strings,

7

particularly if F = 8, 16, 32 or 64. In the present paper we use only F =
16, Q = 2, storing the whole ”language” in one two-byte computer word.
When a child is born, with probability p its language diﬀers from that of
the mother (fathers are assumed not to help in rearing children and are thus
neglected) on one randomly selected position where the bit is changed with
probability q and is taken from the corresponding bit of a randomly selected
other person with probability 1 − q. In the present paper we set the transfer
probability q to zero: No language learns from other languages.

Finally, speakers of small languages switch with a probability r to the
language of a randomly selected other person (which usually is a widespread
language); this r is quadratic in the fraction of people speaking a language
since a language is mostly used for communication between two people. If xi
is the fraction of people speaking language i, then r = (1 − xi)2, r = 1 − x2
i
and r = 0.9(1 − x2
if we
start with everybody speaking the same language, and (1 − xi)2 if the initial
population is distributed randomly among the 65536 possible languages.

i ) have been used; the present paper uses 1 − x2
i

Each person gives birth to one child per iteration, and dies with a Ver-
hulst probability proportional to the current total number N(t) of people,
due to lack of space and food. In the present paper we start with the same
population which for the given Verhulst probability is already the equilibrium
population N0. If instead one starts with only one person, the ﬂight proba-
bility r is reduced by a factor N(t)/N0 since for low population densities the
selection pressure on languages is weaker [2]. We averaged the numbers ns
of language sizes over the second half of the simulation.

programs are available by e-mail as language35.f and language36.f.

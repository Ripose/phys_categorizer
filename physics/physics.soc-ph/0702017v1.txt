Abstract

Real social interactions occur on networks in which each individual is con-

nected to some, but not all, of others. In social dilemma games, heterogeneity

in the number of contacts per player is known to promote evolution of coopera-

tion in a ﬁxed population size. With positively biased payoﬀ structure, which is

customarily used in evolutionary games, players with more neighbors play more

frequently, earn more, and propagate cooperation to others. However, maintain-

ing a social contact can be costly, and so the gross payoﬀ per participation is

not necessarily positive. We show that even a relatively small participation cost

extinguishes the advantage of heterogeneous networks. In this situation, more

connected players are charged more so that they are no longer spreaders of coop-

eration. If participation is even more costly, those with fewer contacts win and

guide the evolution. Although the baseline payoﬀ modulated by the participa-

tion cost is irrelevant in homogeneous networks, it drastically aﬀect evolution on

heterogeneous networks.

1 Introduction

Cooperation of individuals is a key phenomenon at many diﬀerent scales. Many small

organisms and social animals including humans alike show altruistic behavior even

when being selﬁsh is apparently optimal for an individual. Emergence of altruism in

1

situations of social dilemmas can be explained by various mechanisms, such as kin

selection, direct reciprocity, and indirect reciprocity (1). Altruism is also provided by

spatial reciprocity derived from the viscosity of populations (1–3). In reality, players

involved in a social game are not well-mixed as assumed in many studies but prefer-

entially interact with others nearby. As an extreme case, players can be aligned on a

spatially structured graph such as the square lattice. Then cooperators form close-knit

clusters of conspeciﬁcs to survive the invasion of selﬁsh defectors. Maintenance of such

clusters is much more diﬃcult in well-mixed populations modeled by the random graph

and the all-to-all connected network.

To be more realistic, players often inhabit networks of social contacts more complex

than the square lattice, the random graph, and the all-to-all connected network (4).

First, real social networks are small-world, implying the combination of abundant lo-

calized interactions, as in the square lattice, and suﬃcient shortcuts that connect seem-

ingly remote players, as in the random graph. Second, players are heterogeneous in

terms of the number of contacts with others. An extreme case of this is the scale-free

network in which the number of neighbors is distributed according to the power law. In

conventional networks, the number of neighbors is the same for everybody (regular lat-

tices and the all-to-all connected network) or distributed with a narrow tail (so-called

Erd¨os-Reny´ı random graph). Even though not all social networks are scale-free, the

number of neighbors is naturally heterogeneous.

Recently, it was shown that such heterogeneous networks promote evolution of

cooperation in symmetrical two-person games with dilemma, namely, the Prisoner’s

Dilemma, the snowdrift game, and the stag hunt game. Particularly, scale-free networks

are strong ampliﬁers of altruism owing to broad distributions of the number of neighbors

(5–9). In these studies, the gross payoﬀ, namely, the typical payoﬀ obtained through

one interaction, is positively biased. Then it is worth participation, and this is the key

to enhanced cooperation. For illustration, we denote by hot players those with many

neighbors, such as hubs (players with many neighbors) (10). Cold players are those

with a small number of neighbors, such as leaves in a network. Hot players are allowed

in more rounds of the game than cold players per unit time. Then hot players earn

2

more than cold players because of ‘base’ payoﬀs that are proportional to the number of

neighbors. As a result, hot players are more successful in disseminating their strategies.

Particularly, cooperation once adopted by a hub is stable, and so altruism is spread

via hubs.

others.

This situation is realized by two-person games that consist of all nonnegative payoﬀ

values or positively biased payoﬀ matrices (5–9). To our knowledge, this assumption has

been made in all the existing studies of games on heterogeneous networks (e.g. (11–16))

and coevolutionary dynamics of network structure and strategies (17–19) (but see a

general framework in (20; 21)). Such payoﬀ matrices give priority to hot players.

However, they win not because they play well but because they are connected to many

In this paper, we critically reexamine the eﬀect of heterogeneous networks on emer-

gence of cooperation.

In real games, participation in the game may be costly. A

connection to a neighbor implies building and maintaining communication, and this

cost is actually modeled in some economic models of network formation (22–24). Ex-

pensive entry fees would dismiss the premium of hot players, and then the altruism

may not be promoted on heterogeneous networks.

We study two-person games with the participation cost on networks of a ﬁxed size.

We show that there are three regimes depending on how costly participation is. First,

when participation is inexpensive as in most studies, we conﬁrm the known result:

cooperation is enhanced on heterogeneous networks. Second, when the participation

cost is intermediate, the eﬀect of the game and that of the network are comparable.

In this situation, altruism does not develop on heterogeneous networks. Third, when

participation is very costly, initial strategies of cold players propagate to other players,

with hot players myopically following what cold players do. With the low and high

participation cost, networks rather than the rule of the game dominate the evolutionary

dynamics. In the intermediate regime, evolution is most sensitive to the game structure.

2 Model

We compare eﬀects of two types of networks on the evolution of cooperation. A diluted

well-mixed population is modeled by the regular random graph in which each player has

8 neighbors that are chosen randomly from the population. Heterogeneous networks are

modeled by the scale-free network model proposed by Barab´asi and Albert (BA model),
in which the number of neighbors denoted by k follows the power law p(k) ∝ k−3 (25).
Note that many real networks support p(k) ∝ k−γ for a wide range of k, with γ

typically falling between 2 and 3 (4). The average number of neighbors in the scale-

free networks is set equal to 8 for fair comparison with the regular random graph. Both

types of networks consist of n = 5000 players.

To probe the network eﬀect, we consider only two simple strategies without memory,

namely, unconditional cooperation and unconditional defection. The initial fraction of

cooperators is denoted by c0. In one generation, everybody participates in the two-

person game with all the neighbors. The payoﬀ matrix will be speciﬁed in the next

section.

Each player tends to copy successful strategies in its neighborhood. We apply the

update rule compatible with the replicator dynamics, following the previous literature

(6–8). Suppose that player x with kx neighbors has obtained generation-payoﬀ Px. To

update the strategy, x selects a player y among the kx neighbors with equal probability

(= 1/kx). Then x copies y’s strategy with probability (Py − Px) / {max (kx, ky) ·

[uppermost payoﬀ in one game - lowermost payoﬀ in one game] } if Py > Px. The

denominator is the normalization constant so that the replacement probability ranges

between 0 and 1. If Py ≤ Px, the strategy of x is unchanged. All the players experience

updating according to this rule synchronously. This completes one generation.

Each evolutionary simulation consists of 5000 generations. The ﬁnal fraction of

cooperators denoted by cf is calculated as the average fraction of cooperators based on

the last 1000 generation of 5 runs with diﬀerent initializations for each network and 5

diﬀerent realizations of the network.

3.1 Prisoner’s Dilemma

We ﬁrst examine how the participation cost aﬀects the level of altruism in the Prisoner’s

Dilemma. We start with the payoﬀ matrix of the simpliﬁed Prisoner’s Dilemma given

The entries of Eq. (1) indicate the payoﬀ that the row player gains when playing against

an opponent, who is the column player. The ﬁrst (second) row and column correspond

to cooperation (defection). The Prisoner’s Dilemma arises when T > 1, and larger T

results in more defectors. With participation cost h, the payoﬀ matrix becomes

far as T > 1. Scale-free networks amplify cooperation when participation is costless

(h = 0) (6–8).

the players.

Figure 1 presents the ﬁnal fraction of cooperators cf with T and h varied. The level

of cooperation is not aﬀected by h on the regular random graph (Fig. 1(a)). Because

each player has the same number of neighbors, participation cost does not diﬀerentiate

By contrast, h has a dramatic inﬂuence for the scale-free networks, as shown in

Fig. 1(b). We found three qualitatively diﬀerent scenarios, which roughly correspond

to (I) h ≤ 0.25, (II) 0.25 ≤ h ≤ 2, and (III) h ≥ 2. The transition between (II) and

(III) is fairly gradual.

3.1.1 Regime (I): Costless Participation

When h ≤ 0.25, participation is costless, and hot players such as hubs are strong

competitors regardless of the strategies of their cold neighbors. Hot players gain more

5

because they play more often than cold cooperators and cold defectors do (26). As a

result, cooperation spreads from hot players to their cold neighbors. This increases the

local density of cooperators around the hot players so that hot players gain more by

mutual cooperation. Cooperation triggered by hot players is self-promotive so that the

fraction of cooperators in the entire population can become large. Defective hot players

may also win for a moment. However, defection then prevails in their neighborhood so

that hot defectors can no longer exploit the neighbors because of mutual defection. This

results in a null generation-payoﬀ of hot defectors so that they can be outperformed

by their cold neighbors. A hot player sticks to cooperation but not to defection.

In sum, heterogeneous networks enhance cooperativity, which recovers the previous

work corresponding to h = 0 (6–9). Note that this regime encompasses h < 0, that

is, when gifts are given for participation so that every player always wins a positive

payoﬀ.

To illuminate on diﬀerent dynamics of hot and cold players, we measure how often

diﬀerent players ﬂip the strategy during the transient. As shown in Fig. 2, colder

players experience more ﬂips when h ≤ 0.25. They myopically follow what hotter

players do until cooperation on hubs is ﬁxated and propagated to these cold players.

Hot players are spreaders of cooperation. Cooperation on hubs is stabilized in an early

stage, yielding less ﬂips of hotter players.

3.1.2 Regime (II): Moderately Expensive Participation

Interestingly, cold players spread their strategies to hot players when h ≥ 0.25 (regimes

(II) and (III)), which is opposite to what occurs in regime (I). For this reason, enhanced

cooperation diminishes, even with a relatively small participation cost.

Regime (II) is deﬁned by small to intermediate h (0.25 ≤ h ≤ 2). Now the payoﬀ

structure is as important as the network structure. When h = 0.3, scale-free networks

surpass the regular random graph in terms of the number of cooperators only for

1 ≤ T ≤ 1.4. When h = 0.6, this range shrinks to 1 ≤ T ≤ 1.1. The privilege of scale-

free networks is entirely lost when h = 1. In regime (II), hot players ﬂip strategies

more than cold players (Fig. 2; h ≥ 0.25), which contrasts to regime (I) (h ≤ 0.25).

Hubs no longer conduct the dynamics.

3.1.3 Regime (III): Costly Participation

When h is roughly greater than 2, participation is really costly. Then cold players

with any strategy surpass hot players and govern the dynamics. This is not because

cold players are tactical but because they play less often and lose less than hot players.

Cold players persist in their initial strategies to be reproduced on hot neighbors. Then,

the ﬁnal fraction of cooperators cf remains almost the same as the initial fraction c0

regardless of T (Fig. 1(b)).

Figure 3 shows sample time courses of the cooperator fraction for various values of

c0. On scale-free networks, cf is roughly equal to c0 in regime (III) (Fig. 3(d)). Let us

remark that dependence on initial conditions also appears in regime (II) (Fig. 3(c)), for

which cooperation prospers only for large c0. The dependence of cf on c0 diminishes

in regime (I) despite large ﬂuctuation (Fig. 3(b)). Also on the regular random graph,

the dependence on c0 is absent (Fig. 3(a)).

We observe qualitatively the same eﬀects of participation costs in other network

models. The scale-free networks based on the conﬁguration model (without growth

and preferential attachment) and the Erd¨os-Reny´ı random graph promote altruism

in regime (I), albeit to a lesser extent than the BA model (6–8). However, these

heterogeneous networks do not enhance altruism in regimes (II) and (III) (results not

shown).

3.2 Snowdrift Game

The snowdrift game originates from a situation of two drivers caught in a snowdrift.

For the two cars to get out, which is equivalent to payoﬀ β(> 1) to both drivers, the

snow must be shoveled away. A total eﬀort of unity must be invested to this task.

Two players may cooperate to share the cost so that each pays 1/2. Alternatively, one

player may cover the full cost. Otherwise, both may refuse to be altruistic to miss the

beneﬁt β. Diﬀerent from the Prisoner’s Dilemma, cooperation deserves even when the

other player defects.

In this case, heterogeneous networks reinforce evolution of cooperation as in the Pris-

oner’s Dilemma (6–8). The participation cost shifts the payoﬀ matrix with the structure

As shown in Fig. 4(a), the participation cost h does not inﬂuence cf on the regular

random graph. The fraction of cooperators converges to the theoretical estimate cf =

1 − r, where r = 1/(2β − 1) is the cost-to-beneﬁt ratio (27). If cooperation is relatively

costly with a small β (large r), cooperators decrease in number.

On heterogeneous networks, how the fraction of cooperators depends on the payoﬀ

structure, which is parameterized by r, diﬀers by the participation cost. We again ﬁnd

three types of r-dependence. By varying h, one can gradually go from one regime to

another, as shown in Fig. 4(b). The scale-free networks can be superior to the regular

random graph in the enhancement of cooperation, only when h is near zero or negative

(regime (I)). In this situation, hot players distribute cooperation to cold players. The

advantage of the scale-free networks is neutralized by intermediate h (roughly speaking,
h ∼= 1), which deﬁnes regime (II). Note that the reduction of cooperation is not as much
as that for the Prisoner’s Dilemma. With large h (roughly speaking, h ≥ 2), cf is rather

insensitive to the game structure (regime (III)). In regimes (II) and (III), dominant

strategies spread from cold to hot players.

In accordance with the previous sections, we denote the strategy corresponding to the

ﬁrst (second) row and column by cooperation (defection). As T increases, players are

tempted to defect, and cf decreases. As S decreases, players would not cooperate

so that they are not exploited by defectors. Therefore, cf decreases. The Prisoner’s

Dilemma, the snowdrift game, and the stag hunt game, are deﬁned by T > R > P > S,

T > R > S > P , and R > T > P > S, respectively. An additional condition

2R > T + S is usually assumed for the Prisoner’s Dilemma so that payoﬀs of two

players sum up to be larger with mutual cooperation than with unilateral cooperation.

We remove these restrictions on the payoﬀ values to deal with general games. Be-

cause multiplying each element of Eq. (5) by a common constant modiﬁes just the time

scale of evolution, there are three free parameters in the payoﬀ matrix. Accordingly,

we set R = 1 and P = 0 and vary T , S, and h.

In Fig. 5(a), cf for h = 0 is plotted for the regular random graph. As expected,

the number of cooperators increases with T and decreases with S. The results are

independent of h because all the players have the same number of neighbors and are

charged the same participation cost per generation.

For the scale-free networks, we plot cf measured in the T -S parameter space that

are sliced out by ﬁxing four values of h (Fig. 5(b-e)). In this way we conﬁrm the three

regimes, extending the results shown in Figs. 1 and 4 in terms of the variety of the

game. First, without the participation cost, evolution of cooperation is promoted on the

scale-free networks (Fig. 5(b)), which reproduces the previous work (7). Cooperation

is strengthened in the Prisoner’s Dilemma (T > 1, S < 0), the snowdrift game (T > 1,

S > 0), and also the stag hunt game (T < 1, S < 0). Second, the advantage of

the heterogeneity is lost for a wide range of T and S when h = 0.5 (Fig. 5(c)) and

h = 1 (Fig. 5(d)). Third, when participation is very costly (h = 2), the evolutionary

dynamics is governed by the initial condition. Defectors survive even without dilemma

(S > 0, T < 1), and considerable cooperators survive under the Prisoner’s Dilemma

(Fig. 5(e)). These paradoxical results yield because the eﬀect of players’ actions is

smeared as h increases. Note that cf shown in Fig. 5(e) is sensitive to c0, which is ﬁxed

to be a half in the numerical simulations.

4 Discussion

4.1 Summary of Results

We have discovered that the cost of participation casts a dramatic eﬀect on the dy-

namics of evolutionary games on heterogeneous networks. This is because players are

charged diﬀerent amounts of fees per generation depending on the number of neigh-

bors with whom they play. By contrast, the evolution in well-mixed populations and

on the regular lattices is invariant under changes in the participation cost, which aﬀects

everybody alike.

Speciﬁcally, we have found three regimes. When participation is nearly free (regime

(I)), networks with heterogeneous numbers of neighbors per player, such as the scale-

free networks, promote cooperation (5–9). This is because the cooperation adopted by

hot players, namely, players with many neighbors, is robust against invasion of cold

players with whatever strategy. Hot players have advantage there. When the participa-

tion cost is intermediate (regime (II)), cooperators do not really increase on heteroge-

neous networks. Quantitatively speaking, scale-free networks can be even detrimental

to altruism than homogeneous networks are. When participation is expensive (regime

(III)), cold players are strong regardless of strategies, and hot players myopically fol-

low whatever cold players do. This is opposite to what happens in regime (I). If the

participation were voluntary in regime (III) (28), the loners that abstain from playing

the game would be dominant (24).

Although the boundaries are not sharp, these three regimes are distinguished based

on population behavior for a wide class of games encompassing the Prisoner’s Dilemma,

the snowdrift game, and the stag hunt game. We have focused on a standard growing

scale-free network model (BA model) and conﬁrmed our results on a nongrowing scale-

free network model and the random graph. The results are expected to be robust

against the choice of the network model.

To our knowledge, almost all the existing work on evolutionary games on networks

used the nonnegative or positively biased payoﬀs, which belong to regime (I). Although

the advantage of heterogeneity is manifested in this regime, the payoﬀ matrix will fall

in regime (II) or (III) even with a relatively small participation cost. Therefore, the en-

hanced cooperation emphasized in these previous papers is not robust. To understand

games on networks, we have to take into account a wider family of payoﬀ matrices than

conventionally used ones. In the present work, an additional dimension of the payoﬀ

matrix is provided by the participation cost.

Our results will remain valid with more sophisticated strategies, although we have

assumed only unconditional cooperators and defectors. The three regimes must be also

distinguished in coevolutionary dynamics of strategies and network structure, where

players can form and sever links as well as play against neighbors. So far, only regime

(I) where hubs can boost cooperation has been explored for evolutionary games (5–9;

12; 13; 15; 29) and coevolutionary dynamics (17–19; 26; 30), except a brief examination

14

in (21).

4.2 What is to Play Games on Networks?

One way to circumvent the heterogeneity eﬀect without introducing the participation

cost is to use homogeneous networks in which everybody has the same number of

neighbors. The square lattice (3), variants of small-world and random graphs without

the dispersion of the number of neighbors (31; 32), and cycles in which everybody is

connected to two players (10; 33) serve to this end. Pair approximation is useful for

understanding evolution on homogeneous networks (34). Evolution on a heterogeneous

network and on its homogeneous counterpart can look similar (11), but such consistency

is not guaranteed in general. Because heterogeneity cannot be neglected in most real

networks (4), homogeneous networks are too restrictive.

For general networks, one can eliminate the heterogeneity eﬀect by using average

payoﬀs (dividing the generation-payoﬀ of each player by the number of neighbors). This

quantity is independent of the number of neighbors. This normalization is adopted in

studies of evolutionary games on standard small-world networks, which are endowed

with some heterogeneity, (35), scale-free networks (9), hierarchical networks (16), real

networks (14), and multipopulation replicator dynamics in which the numbers of con-

tacts depend on the strategy (36).

However, this normalization spoils the notion of game. To see this, let us consider

three players arranged as shown in Fig. 6. Player B, a hot player with two contacts,

plays twice more than players A and C do. If A pays cost c to beneﬁt B by b (> c)

and C does the same, a total value of 2(b − c) is created in the network. After the

normalization, A and C lose c, respectively, whereas B earns 2b/2 = b. This implies

that two altruistic actions, one contributed by A and another by C, yield only b;

2b − b = b has gone away. Similarly, if B donates to A and C, A and C gain b, and B

loses 2c/2 = c. A net value 2b is produced out of c. In reality, values do not emerge

out of scratch or disappear for nothing. This caveat holds for more general games and

networks.

Therefore we assumed that a player simply sums up the payoﬀs obtained by playing

with its neighbors. The same framework is used in evolutionary games on diluted

spatial networks (29), the small-world networks (12; 15), the random graphs with the

poisson degree distribution (5; 13; 15), scale-free networks (6–9), and dynamically

changing networks (17; 18; 20; 26; 30).

4.3 Setting Payoﬀ Structure

Let us assume that total payoﬀs, not average payoﬀs, are used in updating strategies.

For well-mixed populations and regular lattices, evolution is invariant under uniform

addition of a constant to the payoﬀ matrix (e.g. participation cost) and uniform mul-

tiplication of a positive constant. These transformations leave two free parameters in

the payoﬀ matrix. On heterogeneous networks, evolutionary dynamics are conserved

under multiplication but not under addition. The loss of cooperation under positive

aﬃne transformation of the payoﬀ matrix is also pointed out in (21). Then there are

three free parameters that have been chosen to be S, T , and h in Fig. 5.

When participation is costless (regime (I)) or very costly (regime (III)), the net-

work structure, but not the rule of the game, determines the evolution. Only when

participation is moderately costly (regime (II)), the game is relevant. There we have

found that cooperation is not enhanced by introducing heterogeneous networks.

Regime (II) originates from balanced payoﬀ values. The balance implies that some

payoﬀ values are positive and others are negative and that their average, or the gross

payoﬀ, is not far away from 0. Even though we can arbitrarily set the ‘origin’ of

the payoﬀ matrix by modulating the participation cost in homogeneous populations,

this operation is disallowed in heterogeneous populations. Balanced payoﬀ matrices

may be relevant to many real situations. One way to balance a payoﬀ matrix is to

introduce moderate participation costs, as has been done in this work. Moreover, in

an equivalent of the snowdrift game called the chicken game, players try to avoid both

being labeled chicken and crashing into a miserable disaster. The corresponding payoﬀ

matrix can be balanced or negatively biased because the beneﬁt of mutual cooperation,

or β − 1/2 − h in Eq. (4), may be null or even negative (27). Also in practical situations

such as environmental problems, political conﬂicts, and human relationships, the best

one could get is often the least disastrous, but not really wonderful, solution.

It is generally diﬃcult to quantitatively determine payoﬀs in nature. However,

we need to be aware of their absolute values when considering game dynamics on

heterogeneous networks. This paper is a ﬁrst step to establishing a notion of game on

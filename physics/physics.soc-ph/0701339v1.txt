Abstract. Evolving out-of-equilibrium networks have been under intense
scrutiny recently. In many real-world settings the number of links added per new
node is not constant but depends on the time at which the node is introduced in
the system. This simple idea gives rise to the concept of accelerating networks,
for which we review an existing deﬁnition and – after ﬁnding it somewhat
constrictive – oﬀer a new deﬁnition. The new deﬁnition provided here views
network acceleration as a time dependent property of a given system, as opposed
to being a property of the speciﬁc algorithm applied to grow the network. The
defnition also covers both unweighted and weighted networks. As time-stamped
network data becomes increasingly available, the proposed measures may be easily
carried out on empirical datasets. As a simple case study we apply the concepts
to study the evolution of three diﬀerent instances of Wikipedia, namely, those
in English, German, and Japanese, and ﬁnd that the networks undergo diﬀerent
acceleration regimes in their evolution.

Accelerating networks

1. Introduction

In many real-world networks the rate at which links are added to the network is
diﬀerent from the rate at which nodes are added to it, and this seems to be the
case in particular in “functionally organized systems whose operation is reliant on the
integrated activity of any or all of its component nodes” [1]. This results in accelerating
or decelerating networks, of which the Internet is one example [2]. Other examples
of such systems include the arrangement of components on an integrated chip,
conﬁguration of computers in clusters, structure of integrated production systems,
conﬁguration of human social and communication systems, and the organisation of
regulatory proteins controlling gene expression in bacteria [1].

Consider an arbitrary evolving network that may explore any allowed trajectory
in its phase space of node number N (t) (number of nodes at time t) and link number
M (t) (number of links at time t). A constructed example of such a network is shown
in Fig. 1. In an undirected network of size N (t), the total number of possible links is
N (t)(N (t) − 1)/2 of which M (t) exist at some time t. The ratio of the two is described
by

Figure 1. The trajectory of an evolving network might exist anywhere in the
allowable region of the phase space corresponding to its number of nodes N (t)
and number of links M (t). This might be a network evolving according to some
algorithm or an empirically observed network. Whilst it is possible that at any
stage in its evolution the network might have many components, the criterion
M (t) < (N (t) − 1) imposes the condition.

In many conventional non-equilibrium evolving (growing) networks this quantity
is expected to decrease for large values of t. As time-stamped network data becomes
increasingly available, we expect most networks to exhibit non-trivial behaviour with
respect to their acceleration characteristics. The notion of accelerating networks has

Accelerating networks

been considered before [3, 4], and here we consider the notions of network acceleration
as discussed by Gagen and Mattick in [3]. Although interesting, the deﬁnitions in
[3] seem constrictive in that they are applicable only to a speciﬁc algorithm, and the
concept of acceleration is static in nature, i.e., a given network is considered to be either
accelerating, non-accelerating, or decelerating throughout its evolution. Contrary to
this, the notion of acceleration in physical systems refers to the nature of the evolution
of a system at a speciﬁc moment in time, suggesting that acceleration in the context of
complex networks should be reconsidered. In addition, it is imperative that network
acceleration be measurable for empirical networks.

We review the model of Gagen and Mattick in Section 2 and critically examine
the proposed concept of network acceleration in Section 3. This is followed by a new
deﬁnition of network acceleration in Section 4. This might be used to describe a
network at any stage of its evolution (whether decaying, growing, or neither), and
applies to both directed and undirected networks. We then extend the analysis to
incorporate weighted links. We demonstrate the use of the new deﬁnition in a simple
empirical case study in Section 5, and conclude our discussion in Section 6.

2. The model of Gagen and Mattick

In the model of Gagen and Mattick (GM-model), as in many other conventional out-
of-equilibrium evolving network models, the system evolves by introducing exactly
one new node at each time step. The key feature of the model is that the new node
connects to the existing single-component network through a time-dependent number
of links, whereas in most evolving network models [6] the new node attaches to the
existing network with a ﬁxed, time-independent number of links m, as demonstrated
in Fig. 2.

Figure 2. Evolution of a network. In most out-of-equilibrium network models a
new node attaches to the existing network with m links at each time step via some
arbitrary attachment mechanism. These links might be directed or undirected,
weighted or unweighted.

Here we shall consider the scenario whereby the new node attaches with
undirected binary (unweighted) links. Speciﬁcally, we assume that each new node
attaches with on average m(t) links. Whether or not the number of links added

Accelerating networks

per time step is a stochastic process, the actual evolution of the system will be if
a stochastic attachment algorithm (random, preferential, or otherwise) is employed.
Clearly, the maximum number of links with which the new node can connect with
to the existing network, is equal to the number of nodes within the existing network.
Gagen and Mattick actually specify the functional form describing the expected rate
of link addition m(t) as

m(t) = p

N (t)

α

.

(cid:0)

Here α is an described as an acceleration parameter and p as a probability constant
with the constraint of 0 ≤ p ≤ 1. Gagen and Mattick describe the type of a network
in terms of α as either decelerating (α < 0), non-accelerating (α = 0), accelerating
(0 < α < 1), or hyper-accelerating (α ≥ 1). Some examples are shown in Fig. 3. We
shall revisit such deﬁnitions later.

Figure 3. The evolution of the expected number of links added per new node,
m(t) = p(N (t))α, within the Gagen and Mattick model of accelerating networks.
Three examples comprising non-acceleration (α = 0), acceleration (α = 0.8) and
hyper-acceleration (α = 1.5) are displayed [3].

We note that for a non-accelerating network (α = 0) within this description, the
expected number of new links added is simply p ∈ [0, 1] such that, on average, at most
one link may be added per time step. Note also that the hyper-accelerating network
has a ﬁnite time scale for which it can be applied in that the maximum number of
links that can possibly be added to the system is N (t). This sets an upper bound
on m(t) after which the network cannot hyper-accelerate, i.e., in order to continue
hyper-acceleration, it would have to introduce more than N (t) links per time step,
which is impossible without allowing for multiple links between any pair of nodes.

We also note also that so far the actual attachment mechanism, random or
otherwise, has not been discussed, meaning that the accelerating nature of the network
is simply related to the rate of link addition. This is an important point to consider
because although the expected number of links added for the new node is m(t), the
variance in this will diﬀer between microscopic attachment mechanisms. Indeed, the
variance could be zero for integer m(t), corresponding to exactly m(t) begin added
every time step, or the number of links to add could be drawn from a probability
distribution with mean m(t). Even though the number of links to be added might

Accelerating networks

be deterministic, one still needs to specify the algorithm to determine to which nodes
within the existing network these links are attached.

3. Rethinking the accelerating network

The notion of network acceleration is applicable to situations whereby the rates of
node and link addition are not stochastic. As such, in introducing the concepts key to
their understanding, it is useful to concentrate on this conceptually simpler scenario.
Consider some arbitrary evolving network whose evolution we can observe. This
might be a realisation of an algorithm or an empirically observed evolving network.
At time t = 0 we have an initial conﬁguration of N (0) nodes and M (0) links. At
each time step, a quantity of new nodes n(t) are added and they are connected to the
pre-existing network with some number of binary links m(t). These are both integer
quantities. In this scenario no new links are formed between existing nodes within the
network, although this feature could be incorporated. For now, we shall assume that
n(t) = 1 such that exactly one new node is added per time step‡. As such, at time
t = 1 the number of nodes is N (1) = N (0) + 1. The maximum number of links that
could have been introduced on attaching the N (1)th node is clearly N (0) as the new
node can link to each previous node with at most one link. Similarly, for a node added
at time t, the total number of nodes is N (t) = N (0) + t and the maximum number of
links that could have been used to connect it is N (t − 1). For this process, by which
one new node is added per time step, we know that N (t − 1) = N (t) − 1. This is the
upper limit for the time-dependent number of added links, m(t), at each time step.
This region is depicted Fig. 4.

node is capped by the total number of nodes in the existing network (line). Here,
as one new node is added per time step, the growth of the network in terms of
number of nodes is linear.

Clearly, the functional form of m(t) could be any function that exists within the

‡ Often, there is little merit in adding more than one node per time step as this might be equivalent
to adding one node per time step over a longer period. However, situations might arise, virtual or
empirical, in which several nodes are added per time step.

allowable region of m(t) ≤ (N (t) − 1) for the addition of one node per time step. For
the addition of n(t) nodes per time step, the constraint becomes

m(t)
n(t)

≤ N (t − 1).

One can envisage any number of such functions for the time-dependent number of
links added. We note that once the function reaches the constraint, the network can
no longer evolve according to such a process.

Figure 5. Left: A fairly standard example of a non-accelerating network in
which more that one link is used to link the new node to the existing network.
Right: Although this evolving network asymptotes to non-accelerating behaviour,
clearly, initially, it is accelerating.

A simple example might be such that a single new node is added with m(t) = N (0)
links per time step with N (0) > 1 as depicted in Fig. 5. This is a non-accelerating
network that could not be described by the GM-model that only allows at most one
new link per new node for non-accelerating networks, corresponding to p = 1 and
α = 0 in their model. Another example function is one that is initially increasing but
asymptotes to a constant value as depicted in Fig. 5. This might be some empirically
observed network growth or the behaviour of some growth algorithm. Would this be
described an accelerating, decelerating or non-accelerating network? Clearly, diﬀerent
regimes of this particular network evolution might satisfy diﬀering descriptions. As
such, we must re-deﬁne the accelerating network to encompass this feature.

4. Deﬁning accelerating networks

One might expect that one could identify the regimes of accelerating, non-acceleration
and deceleration with relative ease, writing these phenomena in terms of the mean
degree hki = 2M (t)/N (t) of the network. Speciﬁcally, one might expect that if the
addition of a new node via some number of links results in the mean degree of the
entire network to increase, the network would be described as accelerating. Likewise,
if the mean degree remains constant, the network is not accelerating and, if the mean
degree decreases with the addition of new nodes, the network could be considered
decelerating.

Figure 6. A schematic illustration of a network evolving over fourteen time steps
in the link and node phase space (solid line). The mean degree of the network is
given by hki = 2M (t)/N (t), and the dashed line represents half the mean degree
of the system at time step 8 (and time step 4). At time step 8 the network
accelerates but the mean degree actually decreases.

Although these ideas are intuitively appealing, one can envisage a scenario
whereby a network might be accelerating without increasing its mean degree. This
event can occur if a network has undergone rapid deceleration such that the rate of
node addition is very low even though it might have been high previously. At some
point the ratio of number of links added to the number of nodes added over a time
step, [M (t) − M (t − 1)]/[N (t) − N (t − 1)], might be less than that for the existing
network as a whole, M (t)/N (t), thereby decreasing the average degree hki while still
constituting network acceleration. This is evident in Fig. 6, in which at time step
t = 8 the network accelerates, although the mean degree of the system decreases as
the ratio M (t)/N (t) decreases. In order for the mean degree to increase the trajectory
would have to exceed the dash line whose gradient represents half the mean degree of
the system at time t = 8.

In order to identify the diﬀerent regimes of network acceleration, we must relate
the rate of increase in the number of links with the rate of addition of new nodes,
denoting the rate of link addition and node addition by the approximate derivatives

m(t) =

≈ M (t) − M (t − 1)

dM (t)
dt
dN (t)
dt

n(t) =

≈ N (t) − N (t − 1).

(4)

We can then deﬁne the regimes of network acceleration. The important ratio is that
of the rate of link addition to the rate of node addition, m(t)/n(t), the evolution of
which prescribes a network measure. We deﬁne network acceleration a(t) as

Accelerating networks

a(t) ≡

d
dt

m(t)
n(t)

.

(cid:19)

(cid:18)

We approximate the discrete values with continuous derivatives and deﬁne the
following three regimes:

a(t) < 0
a(t) = 0
a(t) > 0




decelerating
non-accelerating
accelerating.



As such, a single evolving network might navigate all regimes. Note that the deﬁnition
of a(t) allows more than one node to be added per time step. It is interesting to note
that within this deﬁnition of network acceleration, a decaying network (losing nodes)
could accelerate. Also, we note that the deﬁnition holds for directed graphs. The
above deﬁnition alludes to the notion of network velocity v(t), which we deﬁne as

v(t) ≡

dM (t)
dN (t)

=

m(t)
n(t)

.

This velocity is simply the gradient of the network trajectory in the link-node phase
space as in Fig. 6.

4.1. Note on hyper-acceleration

We note the existence of a turning point in the accelerating a(t) > 0 regime of network
evolution. The acceleration regime a(t) > n(t) cannot be sustained indeﬁnitely as the
number of added links per new node would have to exceed the number of existing nodes
N (t) which is not possible. As such, this behaviour is deemed hyper-acceleration if

a(t) > n(t).

If we reconsider the function m(t) being an initially increasing function of time
asymptoting to a constant value and superimpose the appropriate contour lines, i.e.
y = const and y = n x + const, where coeﬃcient n corresponds to the constant rate
of node addition n(t) = n, one can clearly identify the acceleration regimes for this
particular evolving network. This evolution is depicted in Fig. 7. We observe hyper-
acceleration between A and B, acceleration between B and C and non-acceleration
between C and D. These acceleration regimes are shown schematically in Fig. 8.

4.2. Accelerating weighted networks

Having deﬁned the accelerating unweighted evolving network, we now extend the
concept to encompass weighted networks. This is a relatively simple process. The key
components in the deﬁnition of the network acceleration for unweighted graphs were
the rates of node and link addition, both of which are macroscopic properties of the
system. Similarly, we can observe the macroscopic weight of the system, denoted L(t),
which reﬂects the total weight of all the links within the network expressed as

The total weight of the evolving network at time t is constrained by the total

number of possible links, given by Lmax(t) = N (t)(N (t) − 1)/2.

In a similar manner to the unweighted scenario (see Eq. 4 for comparison), we

make use of the approximate derivatives and write

l(t) =

≈ L(t) − L(t − 1)

n(t) =

≈ N (t) − N (t − 1).

(9)

For useful comparison between networks, it in important to normalise the weights such
that for any link w ∈ [0, 1] otherwise l(t) would vary enormously according to the type
of network under consideration§ The evolution of these rates for weighted graphs are
then used to deﬁne velocity and acceleration as

§ The method employed with which to perform this normalisation is likely to be situation speciﬁc. A
simple division by the largest weight in the network might suﬃce or some cumulative binning process
might be appropriate.
In either case, it is necessary to take care with respect to the statistical
signiﬁcance of outliers.

(cid:19)

Note that if the weights are restricted to be binary in nature, the above weighted
deﬁnitions of Eq. 10 recover the unweighted deﬁnitions of Eq. 4, i.e., ˜v(t) → v(t) and
˜a(t) → a(t) as weights are made binary, which is a desirable feature of any weighted
network metric. The above deﬁnition is then possibly the most general deﬁnition
in that it can be applied to both weighted and unweighted, as well as directed or
undirected, evolving networks.

4.3. Stochastic accelerating networks

The deﬁnitons (weighted and unweighted) outlined in this section have been
introduced for the scenario whereby the rates of node and link addition are not
stochastic. They are, infact, easily applied to stochastic situations.
In this case,
the corresponding measures would be the expected velocity hv(t)i and expected
acceleration ha(t)i. In certain cases, it might be possible to achieve this by simply
replacing n(t), m(t) and l(t) by their expectation values although in general this will
not be suitable. For this to be appropriate we require rather speciﬁc constraints on the
evolution of the system, namely that the rate of node addition n(t) is deterministic
and the rate of link (weight) addition is not path dependent. That is, m(t) is not
dependent on the number of links added at the last time step (i.e. is independent of
M (t − 1)).

In general, to evaluate the required quantities properly, we must consider all
possible contributing trajectories of the system’s evolution and their corresponding
probabilities. We must incorporate the possibility that the rates of node and link
addition at a given time step might not be independent of each other and that their
outcomes might also inﬂuence the evolution of the network at the next time step. For
the unweighted case, this would give

5. Case study: Wikipedia

As a simple example of application of the concepts above introduced, we look at the
evolution of Wikipedia in three diﬀerent languages, namely, in English, German and
Japanese. Each of these is a distinct evolving network, such that the nodes correspond
to the articles and the links correspond the the links between articles. The data,
albeit imprecise, is available in the public domain [13]. The evolution through the

(Color online) The evolution of the Wikepedia site network for

the English, German and Japanese sites. The evolution through the macroscopic
M (t) and N (t) phase space of total node and link numbers is shown in the top
plot and the network velocity in the lower.

While the public domain data is somewhat imprecise, the plot of the evolution
of the velocity v(t) of the system does indicate that all networks show an initial
accelerating trend before non-accelerating behaviour is reached as shown in the lower
plot of Fig. 9. There are no negative velocities as the total number of links and the
total number of nodes are increasing in time for all three networks. It is interesting to
note that acceleration of the growing Japanese site far exceeded that of the English
and German sites. This simple example demonstrates that it is reasonable to consider
network velocity and acceleration as time-dependent properties of networks as opposed

Accelerating networks

12

to considering them as static properties of networks as suggested in [3]. It is also very
straightforward to measure the introduced characteristics, velocity and acceleration,
for empirical networks, which further supports their role in network characterization.

6. Conclusion

We have revisited the framework of network acceleration suggested by Gagen and
Mattick [3]. We have explored the limits of the proposed deﬁnition of network
acceleration and, based on our ﬁndings, have provided an alternative deﬁnition for
accelerating networks. Perhaps most important is the conceptual diﬀerence between
the two deﬁnitions: the concept of network acceleration as introduced in this paper
refers to the properties of the network at a particular moment in time as opposed to
an algorithm governing the evolution of the network as suggested in [3]. In addition to
introducing the related concept of network velocity, we have augmented the deﬁnition
of network acceleration to cover weighted networks as well. As such, the deﬁnition
put forward in this paper holds for both weighted and unweighted, as well as directed
and undirected graphs. We have demonstrated the utility of these concepts by their
simple application to study the evolution of Wikipedia in three diﬀerent languages.
While the data obtained from public domain is not very accurate, the obtained results
clearly support the conclusion that networks undergo diﬀerent regimes of acceleration
throughout their evolution. Since measurement of the proposed characteristics for
empirical networks is very simple, we hope that the measures will ﬁnd their use in
the study of network evolution, in particular as time-stamped network data becomes
increasingly available in the future.

(Dated: February 2, 2008)

The dynamics of many social, technological and economic phenomena are driven by individual human ac-
tions, turning the quantitative understanding of human behavior into a central question of modern science.
Current models of human dynamics, used from risk assessment to communications, assume that human actions
are randomly distributed in time and thus well approximated by Poisson processes. Here we provide direct
evidence that for ﬁve human activity patterns, such as email and letter based communications, web browsing,
library visits and stock trading, the timing of individual human actions follow non-Poisson statistics, charac-
terized by bursts of rapidly occurring events separated by long periods of inactivity. We show that the bursty
nature of human behavior is a consequence of a decision based queuing process: when individuals execute tasks
based on some perceived priority, the timing of the tasks will be heavy tailed, most tasks being rapidly executed,
while a few experiencing very long waiting times. In contrast, priority blind execution is well approximated
by uniform interevent statistics. We discuss two queueing models that capture human activity. The ﬁrst model
assumes that there are no limitations on the number of tasks an individual can hadle at any time, predicting
τ −α
that the waiting time of the individual tasks follow a heavy tailed distribution P (τw)
w with α = 3/2.
The second model imposes limitations on the queue length, resulting in a heavy tailed waiting time distribution
characterized by α = 1. We provide empirical evidence supporting the relevance of these two models to human
activity patterns, showing that while emails, web browsing and library visitation display α = 1, the surface mail
based communication belongs to the α = 3/2 universality class. Finally, we discuss possible extension of the
proposed queueing models and outline some future challenges in exploring the statistical mechanisms of human
dynamics. These ﬁndings have important implications not only for our quantitative understanding of human
activity patterns, but also for resource management and service allocation in both communications and retail.

INTRODUCTION

Humans participate on a daily basis in a large number of
distinct activities, from electronic communication, such as
sending emails or browsing the web, to initiating ﬁnancial
transactions or engaging in entertainment and sports. Given
the number of factors that determine the timing of each action,
ranging from work and sleep patterns to resource availability,
it appears impossible to seek regularities in the apparently ran-
dom human activity patterns, apart from the obvious daily and
seasonal periodicities. Therefore, in contrast with the accurate
predictive tools common in physical sciences, forecasting hu-
man and social patterns remains a difﬁcult and often elusive
goal. Yet, the need to understand the timing of human ac-
tions is increasingly important. Indeed, uncovering the laws
governing human dynamics in a quantitative manner is of ma-
jor scientiﬁc interest, requiring us to address the factors that
determine the timing of human actions. But these questions
are driven by applications as well: most human actions have
a strong impact on resource allocation, from phone line avail-
ability and bandwidth allocation in the case of Internet or Web
use, all the way to the design of physical space for retail or
service oriented institutions. Despite these fundamental and
practical driving forces, our understanding of the timing of
human initiated actions is rather limited at present.

To be sure, the interest in addressing the timing of events in
human dynamics is not new: it has a long history in the math-
ematical literature, leading to the development of some of the
key concepts in probability theory [1], and has reemerged at

the beginning of the 20th century as the design problems sur-
rounding the phone system required a quantitative understand-
ing of the call patterns of individuals. But most current models
of human activity assume that human actions are performed
at constant rate, meaning that a user has a ﬁxed probability
to engage in a speciﬁc action within a given time interval.
These models approximate the timing of human actions with a
Poisson process, in which the time interval between two con-
secutive actions by the same individual, called the waiting or
inter-event time, follows an exponential distribution [2]. Pois-
son processes are at the heart of the celebrated Erlang formula
[3], predicting the number of phone lines required in an in-
stitution, and they represent the basic approximation in the
design of most currently used Internet protocols and routers
[4]. Yet, the availability of large datasets recording selected
human activity patterns increasingly question the validity of
the Poisson approximation. Indeed, an increasing number of
recent measurements indicate that the timing of many human
actions systematically deviate from the Poisson prediction, the
waiting or inter-event times being better approximated by a
heavy tailed or Pareto distribution [5, 6, 7, 8]. The difference
between a Poisson and a heavy tailed behavior is striking: the
exponential decay of a Poisson distribution forces the con-
secutive events to follow each other at relatively regular time
intervals and forbids very long waiting times. In contrast, the
slowly decaying heavy tailed processes allow for very long
periods of inactivity that separate bursts of intensive activity.

We have recently proposed that the bursty nature of human
dynamics is a consequence of a queuing process driven by hu-

man decision making [5]: whenever an individual is presented
with multiple tasks and chooses among them based on some
perceived priority parameter, the waiting time of the various
tasks will be Pareto distributed. In contrast, ﬁrst-come-ﬁrst-
serve and random task execution, common in most service
oriented or computer driven environments, lead to a uniform
Poisson-like dynamics. Yet, this work has generated just as
many questions as it resolved. What are the different classes
of processes that are relevant for human dynamics? What
determines the scaling exponents? Do we have discrete uni-
versality classes (and if so how many) as in critical phenom-
ena [9], or the exponents characterizing the heavy tails can
take up arbitrary values, as it is the case in network theory
[10, 11, 12]? Is human dynamics always heavy tailed?

In this paper we aim to address some of these questions
by studying the different universality classes that can appear
as a result of the queuing of human activities. We ﬁrst re-
view, in Sect. II, the frequently used Poisson approximation,
which predicts an exponential distribution of interevent times.
In Sect. III we present evidence that the interevent time prob-
ability density function (pdf) P (τ ) of many human activities
is characterized by the power law tail

In Sect. IV we discuss the general characteristics of the queue-
ing models that govern how humans time their various activi-
ties. In Sects. V-VI we study two classes of queuing models
designed to capture human activity patterns. We ﬁnd that re-
strictions on the queue length play an important role in deter-
mining the scaling of the queuing process, allowing us to doc-
ument the existence of two distinct universality classes, one
characterized by α = 3/2 (Sect. V) and the other by α = 1
(Sect. VI). In Sect. VII we discuss the relationship between
interevent and waiting times. Finally, in Sec. VIII we dis-
cuss the applicability of these models to explain the empirical
data, as well as outline future challenges in modeling human
dynamics.

II. POISSON PROCESSES

Consider an activity performed with some regularity, such
as sending emails, placing phone calls, visiting a library, or
browsing the web. We can keep track of this activity by
recording the timing of each event, for example the time each
email is sent by an individual. The time between two consec-
utive events we call the interevent time for the monitored ac-
tivity and will be denoted by τ . Given that the interevent time
can be explicitly measured for selected activities, it serves as a
test of our ability to understand and model human dynamics:
proper models should be able to capture its statistical proper-
ties.

The most primitive model of human activity would assume
that human actions are fundamentally periodic, with a period
determined by the daily sleep patterns. Yet, while certain peri-
odicity is certainly present, the timing of most human actions
are highly stochastic. Indeed, periodic models are hopeless in

capturing the time we check out a book from the library, be-
yond telling us that it should be within the library’s operation
hours. The ﬁrst and still most widely used stochastic model of
human activity assumes that the tasks are executed indepen-
dently from each other at a constant rate λ, so that the time
resolved activity of an individual is well approximated by a
Poisson process [2]. In this case the probability density func-
tion (pdf) of the recorded interevent times has the exponential
form

P (τ ) = λe

−λτ .

(2)

In practice this means that the predicted activity pattern, while
stochastic, will display some regularity in time, events follow-
= 1/λ intervals. Indeed,

in Fig. 1a, where we show a sequence of events generated by a

The Poisson process was originally introduced by Poisson
in his major work applying probability concepts to the admin-
istration of justice [13]. Today it is widely used to quantify the
consequences of human actions, such as modeling trafﬁc ﬂow
patterns or accident frequencies [2], and is commercially used
in call center stafﬁng [14], inventory control [15], or to esti-
mate the number of congestion caused blocked calls in mobile
communications [4]. It has been established as a basic model
of human activity patterns at a time when data collection ca-
pabilities on human behavior were rather limited. In the past
few years, however, thanks to detailed computer based data
collection methods, there is increasing evidence that the Pois-
son approximation fails to capture the timing of many human
actions.

III. EMPIRICAL RESULTS

Evidence that non-Poisson activity patterns characterize
human activity has ﬁrst emerged in computer communica-
tions, where the timing of many human driven events is au-
tomatically recorded. For example, measurements capturing
the distribution of the time differences between consecutive
instant messages sent by individuals during online chats [16]
have found evidence of heavy tailed statistics. Professional
tasks, such as the timing of job submissions on a supercom-
puter [17], directory listings and ﬁle transfers (FTP requests)
initiated by individual users [18] were also reported to display
non-Poisson features. Similar patterns emerge in economic
transactions [19, 20], in the number of hourly trades in a given
security [21] or the time interval distribution between individ-
ual trades in currency futures [22]. Finally, heavy tailed distri-
butions characterize entertainment related events, such as the
time intervals between consecutive online games played by
users [23]. Note, however, that while these datasets provide
clear evidence for non-Poisson human activity patterns, most
of them do not resolve individual human behavior, but capture
only the aggregated behavior of a large number of users. For
example, the dataset recording the timing of the job submis-
sions looks at the timing of all jobs submitted to a computer,
by any user. Thus for these measurements the interevent time
does not characterize a single user but rather a population of
users. Given the extensive evidence that the activity distribu-
tion of the individuals in a population is heavy tailed, these
measurements have difﬁculty capturing the origin of the ob-
served heavy tailed patterns. For example, while most people
send only a few emails per day, a few send a very large number
on a daily basis [24, 25].

If the activity pattern of a large number of users is simul-
taneously captured, it is not clear where the observed heavy
tails come from: are they rooted in the activity of a single
individual, or rather in the heavy tailed distribution of user ac-
tivities? Therefore, when it comes to our quest to understand
human dynamics, datasets that capture the long term activity
pattern of a single individual are of particular value. To our

erate for 10,000 individuals interevent time distributions following a
power-law with exponent α = 1. The distribution of the measured

served in (e-g). If we double the time window of the simulation (h)
the deviation around the average becomes much smaller (l). (i-k) The

heavy tailed.

best knowledge only three papers have taken this approach,
capturing the timing of printing jobs submitted by users [26],
the email activity patterns of individual email users [5, 24]
and the browsing pattern of users visiting a major web por-
tal [7]. These measurements offer direct evidence that the
heavy tailed activity patterns emerge at the level of a single
individual, and are not a consequence of the heterogeneous
distribution of user activity. Despite this evidence, a num-
ber of questions remain unresolved: Is there a single scaling
exponent characterizing all users, or rather each user has its
own exponent? What is the range of these exponents? Next
we aim to address these questions through the study of six
datasets, each capturing individual human activity patterns of

different nature. First we describe the datasets and the collec-
tion methods, followed by a quantitative characterization of
the observed human activity patterns.

Web browsing: Automatically assigned cookies allow us
to reconstruct the browsing history of approximately 250,000
unique visitors of the largest Hungarian news and entertain-
ment portal (origo.hu), which provides online news and mag-
azines, community pages, software downloads, free email and
search engine, capturing 40% of all internal Web trafﬁc in
Hungary [7, 27]. The portal receives 6,500,000 HTML hits
on a typical workday. We used the log ﬁles of the portal to
collect the visitation pattern of each visitor between 11/08/02
and 12/08/02, recording with second resolution the timing of
each download by each visitor [7]. The interevent time, τ , was
deﬁned as the time interval between consecutive page down-
loads (clicks) by the same visitor.

Email activity patterns: This dataset contains the email ex-
change between individuals in a university environment, cap-
turing the sender, recipient and the time of each email sent
during a three and six month period by 3,188 [24] and 9,665
[25] users, respectively. We focused here on the data collected
by Eckmann [24], which records 129,135 emails with second
resolution. The interevent time corresponds to the time be-
tween two consecutive emails sent by the same user.

Library loans: The data contains the time with second res-
olution at which books or periodicals were checked out from
the library by the faculty at University of Notre Dame dur-
ing a three year period. The number of unique individuals in
the dataset is 2,247, together participating in a total of 48,409
transactions. The interevent time corresponds to the time dif-
ference between consecutive books or periodicals checked out
by the same patron.

Trade transactions: A dataset recording all transactions
(buy/sell) initiated by a stock broker at a Central European
bank between 06/99 and 5/03 helps us quantify the profes-
sional activity of a single individual, giving a glimpse on the
human activity patterns driving economic phenomena. In a
typical day the ﬁrst transactions start at 7AM and end at 7PM
and the average number of transactions initiated by the dealer
in one day is around 10, resulting in a total of 54,374 trans-
actions. The interevent time represents the time between two
consecutive transactions by the broker. The gap between the
last transaction at the end of one day and the ﬁrst transaction
at the beginning of the next trading day was ignored.

The correspondence patterns of Einstein, Darwin and
Freud: We start from a record containing the sender, recipient
and the date of each letter [28, 29, 30] sent or received by
the three scientists during their lifetime. The databases used
in our study were provided by the Darwin Correspondence
Project (http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/Departments/Darwin/), the
Einstein Papers Project
(http://www.einstein.caltech.edu/)
and the Freud Museum of London (http://www.freud.org.uk).

received by Darwin (a total of 14,121 letters). Similarly, the

Einstein database contained 14,512 letters sent and 16,289
letters received (total of 30,801). For Freud we have 3183
(2675) sent (received) leters. Note that 1,541 letters in the
Darwin database and 1,861 letters in the Einstein database
were not dated or were assigned only potential time intervals
spanning days or months. We discarded these letters from
the dataset. Furthermore, the dataset is naturally incomplete,
as not all letters written or received by these scientists were
preserved. Yet, assuming that letters are lost at a uniform
rate, they should not affect our main ﬁndings. For these
three datasets we do not focus on the interevent times,
but rather the response or waiting times τw. The waiting
time, τw, represents the time interval between the date of
a letter received from a given person, and the date of the
next letter from Darwin, Einstein or Freud to him or her, i.e.
the time the letter waited on their desk before a response
is being sent. To analyze Einstein, Darwin, and Freud’s
response time we have followed the following procedure: if
individual A sent a letter to Einstein on DATE1, we search
for the next letter from Einstein to individual A, sent on
DATE2, the response time representing the time difference
If there are
τ = DATE2
multiple letters from Einstein to the recipient, we always
consider the ﬁrst letter as the response, and discard the later
ones. Missing letters could increase the response time, the
magnitude of this effect depending on the overall frequency
of communication between the respective correspondence
partners. Yet, if the response time follows a distribution
with an exponential tail, then randomly distributed missing
letters would not generate a power law waiting time:
they
would only shift shift the exponential waiting times to longer
average values. Thus the observed power law cannot be
attributed to data incompleteness.

In the following we will break our discussion in three sub-
sections, each focusing on a speciﬁc class of behavior ob-
served in the studied individual activity patterns.

A. The α = 1 universality class: Web browsing, email, and
library datasets

In Fig. 2a-c we show the interevent time distribution be-
tween consecutive events for a single individual for the ﬁrst
four studied databases: Web browsing, email, and library vis-
itation. For these datasets we ﬁnd that the interevent time dis-
tribution has a power-law tail

with exponent α
1, independent of the nature of the ac-
tivity. Given that for these activity patterns we collected data
for thousands of users, we need to calculate the distribution
of the exponent α determined separatelly for each user whose
activity level exceeds a certain threshold (i.e. avoiding users
that have too few events to allow a meaningful determination
of P (τ )). As Fig. 2e-g shows, we ﬁnd that the distribution of
the exponents is peaked around α = 1.

The scattering around α = 1 in the measured exponents
could have two different origins. First, it is possible that each
user is characterized by a different scaling exponent α. Sec-
ond, each user could have the same exponent α = 1, but given
the fact that the available dataset captures only a ﬁnite time
interval from one month to several months, with at best a few
thousand events in this interval, there are uncertainties in our
ability to determine numerically the exponent α. To demon-
strate that such data incompleteness could indeed explain the
observed scattering, in Figs. 2h and 2l we show the result
of a numerical experiment, in which we generated 10,000
time series, corresponding to 10,000 independent users, the
interevent time of the events for each user being taken from
τ −1. The total length in time of
the same distribution P (τ )
each time series was chosen to be 1, 000, 000. We then used
the automatic ﬁtting algorithm employed earlier to measure
the exponents in Figs. 2e-g to determine numerically the ex-
ponent α for each user. In principle for each user we should
observe the same exponent α = 1, given that the datasets were
generated in an identical fashion. In practice, however, due to
the ﬁnite length of the data, each numerically determined ex-
ponent is slightly different, resulting in the histogram shown
in Fig. 2h. As the ﬁgure shows, even in this well controlled
situation we observe a scattering in the measured exponents,
obtaining a distribution similar to the one seen in Figs. 2e-
g. The longer the time series, the sharper the distribution is
(Fig. 2l), given that the exponent α can be determined more
accurately.

∼

The distributions obtained for the three studied datasets are
not as well controlled as the one used in our simulation: while
the length of the observation period is the same for each user,
the activity level of the users differs widely. Indeed, as we
show in Fig. 2i-k, the activity distribution of the different
users, representing the number of events recorded for each
user, also spans several orders of magnitude, following a fat
tailed distribution. Thus the degree of scattering of the mea-
sured exponent α is expected to be more signiﬁcant than seen
in Fig 2h and l, since we can determine the exponent accu-
rately only for very active users, for which we have a signif-
icant number of datapoints. Therefore, the obtained results
are consistent with the hypothesis that each user is charac-
terized by a scaling exponent in the vicinity of α = 1, the
difference in the numerically measured exponent values being
likely rooted in the ﬁnite number of events we record for each
user in the datasets. This conclusion will be eventually cor-
roborated by our modeling efforts, that indicate that the expo-
nents characterizing human behavior take up discrete values,
one of which, provide the empirically observed α = 1.

As we will see in the following sections, an important mea-
sure of the human activity patterns is the waiting time, τw,
representing the amount of time a task waits on an individ-
ual’s priority list before being executed. For the email dataset,
given that we know when a user receives an email from an-
other user and the time it sends the next email back to her, we
can determine the email’s waiting or response time. There-
fore, we deﬁne the waiting time as the difference between the
time user A receives an email from user B, and the time A
sends an email to user B. In looking at this quantity we should

FIG. 3: Distribution of the response and arrival time intervals of the
email user shown in Fig. 2b. (a) Given two email users A and B, the
response times of user A to B are the time intervals between A re-
ceiving an email from B and A sending an email to B. The response
time distribution of user A is then computed taking into account the
response times to all users he/she communicates with. The continu-

A, the inter-arrival times are the time intervals between the two con-
secutive arrivals of an email to user A, independently of the sender.
The arrival time distribution of user A is obtained taking into account
all the inter-arrival times for that user. The continuous line is a power
law ﬁt with exponent 0.98. (c) The real waiting time distribution of

FIG. 4: Distribution of the response times for the letters replied to
by Einstein, Darwin and Freud, as indicated on each plot. Note that
the distributions are well approximated with a power law tail with
exponent α = 3/2. While for Darwin and Einstein the datasets pro-
vide very good statistics (the power law regime spanning 4 orders
of magnitude), the plot corresponding to Freud’s responses is not so
impressive, yet still being well approximated by the power law dis-
tribution. Note that while in most cases the identiﬁed reply is indeed
a response to a received letter, there are exceptions as well: many of
the very delayed replies represent the renewal of a long lost relation-
ship.

be aware of the fact that not all emails A sends to B are direct
responses to emails received from B, thus there are some false
positives in the data that could be ﬁltered out only by reading
the text of each email (which is not possible in the available
datasets). We have measured the empirically obtained waiting
time distribution in the email dataset, ﬁnding that the distri-
bution of the response times indeed follows a power law with
exponent α = 1 (Fig. 3a).

B. The α = 3/2 universality class: The correspondence of
Einstein, Darwin and Freud

D. Qualitative differences between heavy tailed and Poisson
activity patterns

6

In the case of the correspondence patterns of Einstein and
Darwin we will focus on the response time of the authors,
partly because we will see later that this has the most impor-
tance from the modeling perspective. As shown in Fig. 4, the
probability that a letter will be replied to in τw days is well
approximated by a power law (3) with α = 3/2, the scal-
ing spanning four orders of magnitude, from days to years.
Note that this exponent is signiﬁcantly different from α = 1
observed in the earlier datasets, and we will show later that
modeling efforts indeed establish α = 3/2 as a scaling expo-
nent characterizing human dynamics.

The dataset allows us to determine the interevent times as
well, representing the time interval between two consecutive
letters sent by Einstein, Darwin or Freud to any recipient. We
ﬁnd that the interevent time distribution is also heavy tailed,
albeit the quality of scaling is not as impressive as we observe
for the response time distribution. This is due to the fact that
we do not know the precise time when the letter is written (in
contrast with the email, which is known with second resolu-
tion), but only the day on which it was mailed. Given that both
Einstein and Darwin wrote at least one letter most days, this
means that long interevent times are rarely observed. Further-
more, owing to the long observational period (over 70 years),
the overall activity pattern of the two scientists has changed
signiﬁcantly, going from a few letters per year to as many 400-
800 letters/year during the later, more famous phase of their
professional life. Thus the interevent time, while it appears to
follow a power law distribution, it is by no means stationary.
More stationarity is observed, however, in the response time
distribution.

C. The stock broker activity pattern

For the stock broker we again focus on the interevent

−

time distribution, ﬁnding that the best ﬁt follows P (τ )
∼
τ −α exp(
τ /τ0) with α = 1.3 and τ0 = 76 min (see Fig.
1d). This value is between α = 1 observed for the users in
the ﬁrst three other datasets and α = 3/2 observed for the
correspondence patterns. Yet, given the scattering of the mea-
sured exponents, it is difﬁcult to determine if this represents
a standard statistical deviation from α = 1 or α = 3/2, the
two values expected by the modeling efforts (see Sects. V and
VI), or it stands as evidence for a new universality class. At
this point we believe that the former case is valid, something
that can be decided only once data for more users will become
available. The exponential cutoff is not inconsistent with the
modelling efforts either: as we will show in Appendix C, such
cutoffs are expected to accompany all human activity patterns
with α < 2.

The heavy tailed nature of the observed interevent time dis-
tribution has clear visual signatures. Indeed, it implies that an
individual’s activity pattern has a bursty character: short time
intervals with intensive activity (bursts) are separated by long
periods of no activity (Figs. 1d-f). Therefore, in contrast with
the relatively uniform activity pattern predicted by the Pois-
son process, for a heavy tailed process very dense successions
of events (bursts) are separated by very long gaps, predicted
by the slowly decaying tail of the power law distribution. This
bursty activity pattern agrees with our experience of an indi-
vidual’s normal email usage pattern: during a single session
we typically send several emails in quick succession, followed
by long periods of no email activity, when we focus on other
activities.

IV. CAPTURING HUMAN DYNAMICS: QUEUING
MODELS

The empirical evidence discussed in the previous section
raises several important questions: Why does the Poisson pro-
cess fail to capture the temporal features of human activity?
What is the origin of the observed heavy tailed activity pat-
terns in human dynamics? To address these questions we need
to inspect closely the processes that contribute to the timing of
the events in which an individual participates.

Most of the time humans face simultaneously several work,
entertainment, and family related responsibilities. Indeed, at
any moment an individual could choose to participate in one
of several tasks, ranging from shopping to sending emails,
making phone calls, attending meetings or talks, going to a
theater, getting tickets for a sports event, and so on. To keep
track of the various responsibilities ahead of them, individu-
als maintain a to do or priority list, recording the upcoming
tasks. While this list is occasionally written or electronically
recorded, in many cases it is simply kept in memory. A pri-
ority list is a dynamic entity, since tasks are removed from it
after they are executed and new tasks are added continuously.
The tasks on the list compete with each other for the indi-
vidual’s time and attention. Therefore, task management by
humans is best described as a queuing process [31, 32], where
the queue represents the tasks on the priority list, the server is
the individual which executes them and maintains the list, and
some selection protocol governs the order in which the tasks
are executed. To deﬁne the relevant queuing model we must
clarify some key features of the underlying queuing process,
ranging from the arrival and service processes to the nature of
the task selection protocol, and the restrictions on the queue
length [31]. In the following we discuss each of these ingre-
dients separately, placing special emphasis on their relevance
to human dynamics.

Server: The server refers to the individual (or agent) that
maintains the queue and executes the tasks. In queuing the-
ory we can have one or several servers in parallel (like check-
out counters in a supermarket). Human dynamics is a single

server process, capturing the fact that an individual is solely
responsible for executing the tasks on his/her priority list.

Task Arrival Pattern: The arrival process speciﬁes the
statistics of the arrival of new tasks to the queue. In queuing
theory it is often assumed that the arrival is a Poisson process,
meaning that new tasks arrive at a constant rate λ to the queue,
randomly and independently from each other. We will use this
approximation for human queues as well, assuming that tasks
land at random times on the priority list. If the arrival process
is not captured by a Poisson distribution, it can be modeled
as a renewal process with a general distribution of interarrival
times [31]. For example, our measurements indicate that the
arrival time of emails follows a heavy tailed distribution, thus
a detailed modeling of email based queues must take this into
account. We must also keep in mind that the arrival rate of
the tasks to the list is ﬁltered by the individual, who decides
which tasks to accept and place on the priority list and which
to reject. In principle the rejection of a task is also a decision
process that can be modeled as a high priority short lived task.
Service process: The service process speciﬁes the time it
takes for a single task to be executed, such as the time nec-
essary to write an email, explore a web page or read a book.
In queuing theory the service process is often modeled as a
Poisson process, which means that the distribution of the time
devoted to the individual tasks has the exponential form (2).
However, in some applications the service time may follow
some general distribution. For example, the size distribution
of ﬁles transmitted by email is known to be fat tailed [33, 34],
suggesting that the time necessary to review (read) them could
also follow a fat tailed distribution. In queuing theory it is of-
ten assumed that the service time is independent of the task ar-
rival process or the number of tasks on the priority list. While
we adopt this assumption here as well, we must also keep in
mind that the service time can decrease if too many tasks are
in the queue, as humans may devote less time to individual
tasks when they have many urgent things to do.

Selection protocol or queue discipline: The selection pro-
tocol speciﬁes the manner in which the tasks in the queue are
selected for execution. Most human initiated events require
an individual to weight and prioritize different activities. For
example, at the end of each activity an individual needs to de-
cide what to do next: send an email, do some shopping or
place a phone call, allocating time and resources for the cho-
sen activity. Normally individuals assign to each task a prior-
ity parameter, which allows them to compare the urgency of
the different tasks on the list. The time a task waits before it
is executed depends on the method the agent uses to choose
the task to be executed next. In this respect three selection
protocols are particularly relevant for human dynamics:

(i) The simplest is the ﬁrst-in-ﬁrst-out (FIFO) protocol, ex-
ecuting the tasks in the order they were added to the list. This
is common in service oriented processes, like the ﬁrst-come-
ﬁrst-serve execution of orders in a restaurant or getting help
from directory assistance and consumer support.

(ii) The second possibility is to execute the tasks in a ran-
dom order, irrespective of their priority or time spent on the
list. This is common, for example, in educational settings,
when students are called on randomly, and in some packet

7

routing protocols.

(iii) In most human initiated activities task selection is not
random, but the individual tends to execute always the highest
priority item on his/her list. The resulting execution dynamics
is quite different from (i) and (ii): high priority tasks will be
executed soon after their addition to the list, while low prior-
ity items will have to wait until all higher priority tasks are
cleared, forcing them to stay longer on the list.
In the fol-
lowing we show that this selection mechanism, practiced by
humans on a daily basis, is the likely source of the fat tails
observed in human initiated processes.

Queue Length or System Capacity: In most queuing mod-
els the queue has an inﬁnite capacity and the queue length can
change dynamically, depending on the arrival and the execu-
tion rate of the individual tasks. In some queuing processes
there is a physical limitation on the queue length. For ex-
ample, the buffers of Internet routers have ﬁnite capacity, so
that packets arriving while the buffer is full are systematically
dropped. In human activity one could argue that, given the
possibility to maintain the priority list in a written or elec-
tronic form, the length of the list has no limitations. Yet, if
confronted with too many responsibilities, humans will start
dropping some tasks and not accept others. Furthermore,
while keeping track of a long priority list is not a problem
for an electronic organizer, it is well established that the im-
mediate memory of humans has ﬁnite capacity of about seven
tasks [35, 36]. In other words, the number of priorities we can
easily remember, and therefore the length of our priority list,
is bounded. These considerations force us to inspect closely
the difference between ﬁnite and an unbounded priority lists,
and the potential consequences of the queue length on the the
waiting time distribution.

In this paper we follow the hypothesis that the empirically
observed heavy tailed distributions originate in the queuing
process of the tasks maintained by humans, and seek appropri-
ate models to explain and quantify this phenomenon. Partic-
ularly valuable are queuing models that do not contain power
law distributions as inputs, and yet generate a heavy tailed out-
put. In the following we will focus on priority queues, reﬂect-
ing the fact that humans most likely choose the tasks based on
their priority for execution.

In the empirical datasets discussed in Sect III we focused
on both the interevent time and the waiting time distribution
of the tasks in which humans participate. In the following two
sections we focus on the waiting time of a task on the pri-
ority list rather than the interevent times. In this context he
waiting time, τw, represents the time difference between the
arrival of a task to the priority list and its execution, thus it
is the sum of the time a task waits on the list and the time
devoted to executing it. In Sect. VII we will return to the re-
lationship between the empirically observed interevent times
and the waiting times predicted by the discussed models.

V. MODELS WITH VARIABLE QUEUE LENGTH: α = 3/2
UNIVERSALITY CLASS

Our ﬁrst goal is to explore the behavior of priority queues
in which there are no restrictions on the queue length. There-
fore, in these models an individual’s priority list could con-
tain arbitrary number of tasks. As we will show below, such
models offer a good approximation to the surface mail corre-
spondence patterns, such as that observed in the case of Ein-
stein, Darwin and Freud (see Sect. III B). Therefore, we will
construct the models with direct reference to the the datasets
discussed in Sect. III. We assume that letters arrive at rate λ
following a Poisson process with exponential arrival time dis-
tribution. Replacing letters with tasks, however, provides us a
more general model, in principle applicable to any human ac-
tivity. The responses are written at rate µ, reﬂecting the over-
all time a person devotes to his correspondence. Each letter
is assigned a discrete priority parameter x = 1, 2, . . . , r upon
arrival, such that always the highest priority unanswered letter
(task) will be always chosen for a reply. The lowest priority
task will have to wait the longest before execution, and there-
fore it dominates the waiting time probability density for large
waiting times. This model was introduced in 1964 by Cob-
ham [37] to describe some manufacturing processes. Most of
the analytical work in queuing theory has concentrated on the
waiting time of the lowest priority task, ﬁnding that the wait-
ing time distribution follows [38]

The model can be extended to the case where the priorities

are not discrete, but take up continuous values 0

from an arbitrary η(x) distribution. The Laplace transform of
the waiting time distribution for this case has been calculated
in Ref. [31], but the resulting equation is difﬁcult to invert,
forcing us to study the model numerically (Fig. 5). The nat-
ural control parameter is ρ = λ/µ, allowing us to distinguish
three qualitatively different regimes:

x <

≤

Subcritical regime, ρ < 1: Given that the arrival rate of
the tasks is smaller than the execution rate, the queue will be
often empty. This signiﬁcantly limits the waiting time, most
tasks being executed soon after their arrival. The simulations
indicate that the waiting time distribution exhibits an asymp-
totic scaling behavior consistent with (4) (Fig. 5). While in
the ρ
0 limit we observe mainly the exponential decay, as
ρ approaches 1 a power law regime with exponent α = 3/2
emerges, combined with the exponential cutoff.

Note, however, that in this regime a high fraction of tasks are never
executed, staying forever on the priority list whose length increases
linearly with time, a fact that is manifested by a shift to the right of
the cutoff of the waiting time distribution.

Critical regime, ρ = 1 : When the arrival and the response
rate of the letters are equal, according to (4) and (5) we should
observe a power law waiting time distribution with α = 3/2
(Fig. 5). This regime would imply that, for example, Darwin
responds to all letters he receive, which is not the case, given
that their response rate is 0.32 (Darwin), 0.24 (Einstein) and
0.31 (Freud) [6]. In this case it is easy to show that the queue
length performs a one-dimensional random walk bounded at
l = 0. These ﬂuctuations in the queue length will limit the
waiting time distribution, as the tasks will wait at most as long
as it takes for the queue length to return to l = 0. Therefore,
the waiting time distribution will have as upper bound the re-
turn time distribution of a one-dimensional random walk. It is
known, however, that the return time distribution of a random
t−3/2 [39, 40], which is the origin of
walker follows P (t)
the 3/2 exponent in Eq. (3). This argument indicates that (4)
is related to the ﬂuctuations in the length of the priority list.

Supercritical regime, ρ > 1 : Given that in this regime the

nitely in the queue. Given Darwin, Einstein and Freud’s small
response rate, this regime captures best their correspondence
pattern. We can measure the waiting time for each letter that
is responded to. In Fig. 5 we show the waiting time proba-
bility density obtained from numerical simulations, indicating
that it follows a power law with exponent α = 3/2. Thus the
supercritical regime follows the same scaling behavior as the
critical regime, but only for the letters that are responded to.
The rest of the letters wait indeﬁnitely in the list (τw =

).

While the discussed model can indeed generate power law
waiting time distributions, a critical comparison with the em-
pirical datasets reveals some notable deﬁciencies. First, a
power law distribution emerges only in the critical (ρ = 1) and
the supercritical (ρ > 1) regimes. The critical regime requires
a careful tuning of the human execution rate, so that the exe-
cution and the arrival rates are exactly the same. In contrast,
for ρ > 1 no tuning is necessary, but the number of tasks on
the list increases linearly with time, thus many tasks are never
executed. This limit is probably the most realistic for human
dynamics: we often take on tasks that we never execute, and
technically stay on our priority list forever. As we discussed
above, this is documentedly the case for Einstein, Darwin and
Freud, who answer only a fraction of their letters. However,
we must not overlook the second important feature of the dis-
cussed model: the only exponent it can predict is α = 3/2,
rooted in the ﬂuctuations of the queue length. While this fully
agrees with the correspondence patterns of Einstein, Darwin
and Freud, it is signiﬁcantly higher than the values observed
in the empirical data discussed in Sect. III A on web brows-
ing, email communications or library visits, which we found
to be scattered around α = 1.

In the p
(Fig. 6a), as expected for the random selection protocol. As
the typical length of the priority list differs from individual to
individual, it is important for the tail of P (τw) to be indepen-
dent of L. Numerical simulations indicate that this is indeed
the case: changes in L do not affect the scaling of P (τw) [5].
The fact that the scaling holds for L = 2 as well indicates
that it is not necessary to have a long priority list: even if an
individual balances only two tasks at the same time, a bursty
heavy tailed interevent dynamics will emerge. Next we focus
on the L = 2 case, for which the model can be solved exactly,
providing important insights into its scaling behavior that can
be generalized for arbitrary L values as well.

VI. MODELS WITH FIXED QUEUE LENGTH: α = 1
UNIVERSALITY CLASS

A. Exact solution for L = 2

To understand the limitations of the model discussed in the
previous section we must remember that when the arrival and
execution rates are equal (ρ = 1) the length of the priority
list follows a random walk, and can thus occasionally take up
very large values. The situation is even worse for ρ > 1, when
the queue length increases linearly with time. Therefore, ac-
cording to the model an individual must have the capacity to
keep track of hundreds or thousands of tasks at the same time.
This may be appropriate for surface mail, where the letters
pile on our desk until replied to. In contrast, there is exten-
sive evidence from the psychology literature that the number
of tasks humans can easily keep in their short term memory is
bounded [35], therefore it is unrealistic that we will remember
hundreds or thousands of tasks at any given time. This forces
us to inspect a model in which the length of the priority list
remains unchanged [5], a new task being added only when an
old task is removed from the list (executed).

We assume that an individual mantains a priority list with
L tasks, each task being assigned a priority parameter xi, i =
1, ..., L, chosen from an η(x) distribution. At each time step
with probability p the individual selects the highest priority
task and executes it, removing it from the list. At that moment

In this case almost all tasks have a waiting time τw = 1, be-

Based on the results discussed above, the overall behavior
of the model with a uniform priority distribution can be sum-
marized as follows. For p = 1, corresponding to the case
when always the highest priority task is removed, the model
does not have a stationary state. Indeed, each time the highest
priority task is executed, there is a task with smaller priority
xm left on the list. With probability 1
xm the newly added
task will have a priority x′
m larger than xm, and will be ex-
ecuted immediately. With probability xm, however, the new
task will have a smaller priority, in which case the older task
will be executed, and the new task will become the ‘resident’
one, with a smaller priority x′
m < xm. For a long period
all new tasks will be executed right away, until an another
task arrives with probability x′′
m that again pushes the non-
executed priority to a smaller value x′′
m. Thus with time
the priority of the lowest priority task will converge to zero,
0, and thus with a probability converging to one the
xm(t)
new task will be immediately executed. This convergence of
xm to zero implies that for p = 1 the model does not have a
stationary state. A stationary state develops, however, for any
p < 1, as in this case there is always a ﬁnite chance that the
lowest priority tasks will also be executed, thus the value of
xm will be reset, and will converge to some xm(p) > 0. This
qualitative description applies for arbitrary L > 2 values.

approaches the stationary state we compute the average pri-

(see
Fig. 7a,b) since it represents a lower bound for the average
of any other priorities on the list. We ﬁnd that for any L val-

As the results in the previous subsections show, the model
proposed to account for the α = 1 universality class has some
apparent problems. Indeed, for truly deterministic execution
(p = 1) the model does not have a stationary state. The
problem was cured by introducing a random task execution
(p < 1), which leads to stationarity. In this case, however, a
p dependent fraction of tasks are executed immediately, and
only the rest of the long lived tasks follow a power law. As p
converges to zero, the fraction of tasks executed immediately
diverges, developing a signiﬁcant gap between the power law
regime, and the tasks displaying τ = 1 waiting time. Is this
behavior realistic, or represents an artifact of the model? A
ﬁrst comparison with the empirical data would suggest that
this is indeed an artifact, as measurements shown in Fig. 2 and
3 do not provide evidence of a large number of tasks that are
immediately executed. However, when inspecting the mea-
surement results we should keep in mind that they represents
the intervent times, and not the waiting times.
In the case
when the waiting time can be directly measured, like in the
email or mail based correspondence, there is some ambiguity
to the real waiting time.
Indeed, in the email data, for ex-
ample, we have measured as waiting time the time difference
between the arrival of an email, and the response sent to it.
While this offers an excellent approximation, from an indi-
vidual’s or a priority queue’s perspective this is not the real
waiting time. Indeed, consider the situation when an email
arrives at 9:00 am, and the recipient does not check her email
until 11:56am, at which point she replies to the email imme-
diately. From the perspective of her priority list the waiting
time was less than a minute, as she replied as soon as she
saw the email. In our dataset, however, the waiting time will
be 3 hours and 56 minutes. Thus the way we measured the
waiting times cannot identify the true waiting time of a task
on a user’s priority list. The email dataset allows us, how-
ever, to get a much better approximation of the real waiting
times than we did before. Indeed, for an email e1 received

by user A we record the time t1 it arrives, and then the time
t2 of the ﬁrst email sent by user A to any other user after the
arrival of the selected email. It will be this time from which
we start measuring the waiting time for email e1. Thus if user
A replies to e1 at time t3, we consider that the email’s wait-
t1 considered in Fig
t2, instead of t3 −
ing time τreal = t3 −
3a. The results, shown in Fig 3c, displays the same power
law scaling with α = 1 as we have seen in Fig 3a, but in
addition there is a prominent peak at τreal = 1, coorespond-
ing to emails responded to immediately. Note that the peak’s
magnitude is orders of magnitude larger than the probabilities
displayed by the large waiting times. This result suggests that
what we could have easily considered a model artifact in fact
captures a common feature of email communications. Indeed,
a high fraction of our emails is responded immediately, right
after our ﬁrst chance to read them, as predicted by the prior-
ity model discussed in this section. Are there models that can
provide the α = 1 universality class without the high fraction
of items executed imediatelly? While we have failed to come
up with any examples, we belive that developing such models
could be quite valuable.

VII. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WAITING TIMES AND
INTEREVENT TIMES

As we discussed above, the empirical measurements pro-
vide either the interevent time distribution P (τ ) (Sects. III A
and III C) or the waiting time distribution P (τw) (Sect. III B)
of the measured human activity patterns. In contrast the model
predicts only the waiting time τw of a task on an individual’s
priority list. What is the relationship between the observed
interevent times and the predicted waiting times? The basic
thesis of our paper is that the waiting times the various tasks
experience on an individual’s priority list is responsible for
the heavy tailed distributions seen in the interevent times as
well. The purpose of this section is to discuss the relationship
between the two quantities.

The model predictions, that the waiting time distribution
of the tasks follows a power law, is directly supported by one
dataset in each universality class: the email data and the corre-
spondence data. As discussed in Sect. III, we have measured
the waiting time distribution for both datasets, ﬁnding that the
distribution of the response times indeed follows a power law
with exponent α = 1 (email) and α = 3/2 (correspondence
mail) as predicted by the models. Therefore, the direct mea-
surement of the waiting times are likely rooted in the fat tailed
response time distribution. For the other three datasets, how-
ever, such as web browsing, library visits and stock purchases,
we cannot determine the waiting time of the individual events,
as we do not know when a given task is added to the individ-
ual’s priority list.

To explore the broader relationship between the waiting
times and the interevent times we must remind ourselves that
while during the measurements we are focusing on a spe-
ciﬁc task (like email), the models assume the knowledge of
all tasks that an individual is involved in. Thus the empirical
measurements offer only a selected subset of an individual’s

12

activity pattern. To see the relationship between τ and τw next
we discuss two different approaches.

Queueing of different task categories: The ﬁrst approach
acknowledges the fact that tasks are grouped in different cat-
egories of priorities: we often do not keep in mind speciﬁc
emails to be answered, but rather remember that we need to
check our email and answer whatever needs attention. Simi-
larly, we may remember a few things that we need to shop for,
but our priority list would often contain only one item: go to
the supermarket. When we monitor different human activity
patterns, we see the repetitive execution of these categories,
like going to the library, or doing emails, or browsing the web.
Given this, one possible modiﬁcation of the discussed models
would assume that the tasks we monitor correspond to speciﬁc
activity categories, and when we are done with one of them,
we do not remove it from the list, but we just add it back with
some changed priority. That is, checking our email does not
mean that we deleted email activity from our priority list, but
only that next has some different priority. If we monitor only
one kind of activity, then a proper model would be the follow-
ing: we have L tasks, each assigned a given priority. After
a task is executed, it will be reinserted in the queue with a
new priority chosen from the same distribution η(x). If we
now monitor the time at which the different tasks exit the list,
we will ﬁnd that the interevent times for the monitored tasks
correspond exactly to the waiting time of that task on the list.
Note that this conceptual model would work even if the tasks
are not immediately reinserted, but after some delay τd. In-
deed in this case the interevent time will be τ = τw + τd,
and as long as the distribution from which τd is selected from
is bounded, the tail of the interevent time distribution will be
dominated by the waiting time statistics.

Interaction between individuals: The timing of speciﬁc
emails also depends on the interaction between the individuals
that are involved in an email based communication. Indeed,
if user A gets an email from user B, she will put the email
into her priority list, and answer when she gets to it. Thus
the timing of the response depends on two parameters: the
receipt time of the email, and the waiting time on the prior-
ity list. Consider two email users, A and B, that are involved
in an email based conversation. We assume that A sends an
email to B as a response to an email B sent to A, and viceversa.
Thus, the interevent time between two consecutive emails sent
by user A to user B is given by τ = τ A
w is
the waiting time the email experienced on user A’s queue, and
τ B
w is the waiting time of the response of user B to A’s email.
If both users prioritize their tasks, then they both display the

same waiting time distribution, i.e. P (τ A
w )
w )−α. In this case the interevent time distribu-

In summary, the discussed mechanisms indicate that the
waiting time distribution of the tasks could in fact drive the
interevent time distribution, and that the waiting time and the
interevent time distributions should decay with the same scal-
ing exponent. In reality, of course, the interplay between the

two quantities can be more complex than discussed here, and
perhaps even better mapping between the two measures could
be found for selected activities. But these two mechanisms
indicate that if the waiting time distribution is heavy tailed,
we would expect that the interevent time distribution would
be also affected by it.

VIII. DISCUSSION

Universality classes: As summarized in the introduction,
the main goal of the present paper was to discuss the potential
origin of the heavy tailed distributed interevent times observed
in human dynamics. To start we provided evidence that in ﬁve
distinct processes, each capturing a different human activity,
the interevent time distribution for individual users follow a
power law. Our fundamental hypothesis is that the observed
interevent time distributions are rooted in the mechanisms that
humans use to decide when to execute the tasks on their pri-
ority list. To support this hypothesis we studied a family of
queuing models, that assume that each task to be executed by
an individual waits some time on the individual’s priority list
and we showed that queuing can indeed generate power law
waiting time distributions. We ﬁnd that a model that allows
the queue length to ﬂuctuate leads to α = 3/2, while a model
for which the queue length is ﬁxed displays α = 1. These
results indicate that human dynamics is described by at least
two universality classes, characterized by empirically distin-
guishable exponents. Note that while we have classifed the
models based on the limitations on the queue lenght, we can-
not exclude the existence of models with ﬁxed queue lenght
that scale with α = 3/2, or models with ﬂuctuating lenght
that display scaling with α = 1, or some other exponents.

In comparing these results with the empirical data, we ﬁnd
that email and phone communication, web surﬁng and library
visitation belong to the α = 1 universality class. The corre-
spondence patterns of Einstein, Darwin and Freud offer con-
vincing evidence for the relevance of the α = 3/2 exponent,
and the related universality class, for human dynamics.
In
contrast the fourth process, capturing a stock broker’s activ-
ity, shows α = 1.3. Given, however, that we have data only
for a single user, this value is in principle consistent with the
scattering of the exponents from user to user, thus we can-
not take it as evidence for a new universality class. One issue
still remains without a satisfactory answer: why does email
and surface mail (Einstein, Darwin and Freud datasets) be-
long to different universality classes? We can comprehend
why should the mail correspondence belong to the 3/2 class:
letters likely pile on the correspondent’s desk until they are
answered, the desk serving as an external memory, thus we
do not require to remember them all. But the same argument
could be used to explain the scaling of email communications
as well, given that unanswered emails will stay in our mailbox
until we delete them (which is one kind of task execution).
Therefore one could argue that email based communication
should also belong to the 3/2 universality class, in contrast
with the empirical evidence, that clearly shows α = 1 [5, 24].
Some difﬁculty in comparing the empirical data with the

13

model predictions is rooted in the fact that the models predict
the waiting times, while for many real systems only the in-
terevent times can be measured. It is encouraging, however,
that for the email and the surface mail based commnunication
we were able to determine directly the waiting times as well,
and the exponents agreed with those determined from the in-
terevent times. In addition we argued that in a series of pro-
cesses the waiting time distribution determines the interevent
time distribution as well (see Sect. VII). This argument closes
the loop of the paper’s logic, establishing the relevance of the
discussed queueing models to the datasets for which only in-
terevent times could be measured. We do not feel, however,
that this argument is complete, and probably future work will
strengthen this link. In this respect two directions are partic-
ularly promising. First, designing queueing models that can
directly predict the observed interevent times as well would
be a major advance. Second, establishing a more general link
between the waiting time and interevent times could also be
of signiﬁcant value.

The results discussed in this paper leave a number of issues
unresolved. In the following we will discuss some of these,
outlining how answering them could further our understand-
ing of the statistical mechanics of human driven processes.

Tuning the universality class: As we discussed above, the
discussed models provide evidence for two distinct univer-
sality classes in human dynamics, with distinguishable expo-
nents. The question is, are there other universality classes,
characterized by exponents different from 1 and 3/2? If other
universality classes do exist, it would be valuable not only to
ﬁnd empirical support for them, but also to identify classes of
models that are capable of predicting the new exponents.

In searching for new exponents we need to explore sev-
eral different directions. First, if one inserts some power law
process into the queuing model, that could tune the obtained
waiting time distribution, and the scaling exponents. There
are different ways to achieve this. One method, discussed in
Appendix A, is based on the hypothesis that while we always
attempt to select the highest priority task, circumstances or
resource availability may not allow us to achieve this. For ex-
ample, our highest priority may be to get cash from the bank,
but we cannot execute this task when the bank is closed, mov-
ing on to some lower priority task. One way to account for
this is to use a probabilistic selection protocol, assuming that
the probability to choose a task with priority x for execution
xγ , where γ is a parameter that inter-
in a unit time is Π(x)
polates between the random choice limit (ii) (γ = 0, p = 0)
and the deterministic case, when always the highest priority
item is chosen for execution (iii) (γ =
, p = 1). As shown
in the Appendix A, the exponent α will depend on γ as

∼

α = 1 +

.

(16)

At this moment we do not have evidence that such preferential
selection process acts in human dynamics. However, detailed
datasets and proper measurement tools might help up decide
this by measuring the function Π(x) directly, capturing the se-
lection protocol. Such measurements were possible for com-

plex networks, where a similar function drives the preferential
attachment process [10, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45].

As we discussed above, the main goal of this paper was
to demonstrate that the queuing of the tasks on an individual’s
priority list can explain the heavy tailed distributions observed
in human activity patterns. To achieve this, we focused on
models with Poisson inputs, meaning that both the arrival time
and the execution time are bounded. In some situations, how-
ever, the input distributions can be themselves heavy tailed.
This could have two origins: (i) Heavy tailed arrival time dis-
tribution: As we show in Fig. 3b, there is direct evidence for
this in the email communication datasets: we ﬁnd that the in-
terevent time of arriving emails can be roughly approximated
with a power law with exponent αin = 1. (ii) The execu-
tion time could also be heavy tailed, describing the situation
when most tasks are executed very rapidly, while a few tasks
require a very long execution time. Evidence for this again
comes from the email system:
the ﬁle sizes transmitted by
email are known to follow a heavy tailed distribution [33, 34].
Therefore, if we read every line of an email, in principle the
execution time should also be heavy tailed (i.e. the time we
actually take to work on the response, including reading the
original email). Note, however, that measurements failed to
establish a correlation between email size and the response
time [5]. It is not particularly surprising that both (i) and (ii)
would signiﬁcantly impact the waiting time distribution, gen-
erating a heavy tailed distribution for the waiting times even
when the behavior of the model otherwise would be exponen-
tial, or change the exponent α, thus altering the model’s uni-
versality class. Some aspects of this problem were addressed
recently by Blanchard and Hongler [46]. However, to illus-
trate the impact of the heavy tailed inputs in Appendix E we
study the model of Sect. V with a heavy tailed service time
s−β with 0 < β < 1.
distribution h(s)
Finally, could the power law distributed arrival and execu-
tion times serve as the proper explanation for the observed
heavy tailed interevent time distribution in human dynamics?
Note that in a number of systems we observe heavy tailed dis-
tributed events without evidence for power law inputs. For
example, the timing of the library visits or stock purchases
by brokers does not appear to be driven by any known power
law inputs, and they have negligible execution time compared
with the average observed interevent times. Similarly, the be-
ginning of online games or instant messages is not driven by
ﬁle sizes either, but only by the time availability for playing a
game or sending a message, which is mostly a priority driven
issue. Therefore, while it is important to understand the im-
pact of power law inputs on the scaling properties of various
models, attempts to explain the waiting times solely based on
the heavy tailed inputs only delegate the problem to an earlier
cause (the origin of the power law input).

∼

Potential model extensions: Guided by the desire of con-
structing the simplest models that capture the essence of task
execution, we have neglected many processes that are obvi-
ously present in human dynamics. For example, we assumed
that the priority of the tasks is assigned at the moment the
task was added to an individual’s priority list, and remains
unchanged for the rest of the queuing process. In reality the

14

priorities themselves can change in time. For example, many
tasks have deadlines [46], and one could assume that a task’s
priority diverges as the deadline is approaches. Even in the ab-
sence of a clear deadline some priorities may incease in time
[46], others may decrease. Sometimes external factors change
suddenly a task’s priority– for example, the priority of water-
ing the lawn suddenly diminishes if it starts raining. The pos-
sibility of dropping tasks, either by not allowing them on the
queue, or by simply deleting them from the queue, could also
affect the waiting time distributions. Tasks could be dropped
if they were not executed for a considerable time interval, and
thus become irrelevant, or when the individual is very busy,
or some may be simply forgotten. Obviously, the precise im-
pact on the waiting time distribution will depend on the im-
plementation of the task dropping conditions. It is important
to understand if any or all of these processes could change the
universality class of the waiting time distribution.

Model limitations: The studied datasets do not capture all
tasks an individual is involved in, but only the timing of se-
lected activities, like sending emails or borrowing books from
the library. Yet, we must consider the fact that between any
two recorded events individuals participate in many other non-
recorded activities. For example, if we ﬁnd that an individual
clicks on a new document every few seconds, likely he/she is
fully concentrating on web browsing. However, when we no-
tice a break of hours or days between two consecutive clicks,
it is clear that in the meantime the individual was involved in
a myriad of other activities that were not visible to us. The
queuing models discussed here were designed to take into
consideration all human activities, as we assume that the prior-
ity list of an individual contains all tasks the person is involved
in. Currently an understanding of the interplay between the
recorded and the invisible activities is still lacking.

Task optimization: The order in which we execute differ-
ent tasks is often driven by optimization: we try to minimize
the total time, or some cost functions. This is particularly
relevant if the execution times depend on the order in which
the tasks are executed. For example, often executing a cer-
tain task might be faster if we execute some other preparatory
tasks before, and not in the inverse order. In principle opti-
mization could be incorporated into the studied models by as-
suming that they determine the priority of the tasks. Optimiza-
tion raises several important questions for future work: How
should we model optimization driven queueing processes?
Can they also lead to power laws, and if so, will they result
in new universality classes?

Correlations: So far we have focused on the origin of the
various distributions observed in human dynamics. Distribu-
tions offer little information, however, about potential cor-
relations present in the observed time series. Such correla-
tions were documented in Ref. [26], observing that the cor-
relation function of the interevent time series for printing job
arrivals decayed as a power law. Are such temporal correla-
tions present in other systems as well? What is their origin?
Can the queuing models predict such correations? Answers
to these questions could not only help better understand hu-
man dynamics, but could also aid in distingushing the various
models from each other.

Network effects: In seaching for the explanation for the ob-
served heavy tailed human activity patterns we limited our
study to the properties of single queues. In reality none of our
actions are perforned independently–most of our daily activity
is embedded in a web of actions of other individuals [47, 48].
Indeed, the timing of an email sent to user A may depend on
the time we receive an email from user B. An important fu-
ture goal is to understand how the various human activities
and their timing is affected by the fact that the individuals are
embedded in a network environment.

Non-human activity patterns: Heavy tailed interevent time
distributions do not occur only in human activity, but emerge
in many natural and technological systems. For example,
Omori’s law on earthquaqes [49, 50] records heavy tailed in-
terevent times between consecutive seismic activities; mea-
surements indicate that the ﬁshing patters of seabirds also dis-
play heavy tailed statistics [51]; plasticity paterns [52] and
avalanches in lungs [53] show similar power law interevent
times. While a series of models have been proposed to capture
some of these processes individually, there is also a possibil-
ity that some of these modeling frameworks can be reduced to
various queuing processes. Some of the studied queuing mod-
els show close relationship to several models designed to cap-
ture self-organized criticality [54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59]. Could
the mechanisms be similar at some fundamental level? Even if
such higher degree of universality is absent, understanding the
mechanisms and queuing processes that drive human dynam-
ics could help us better understand other natural phenomena
as well, from the timing of chemical reactions in a cell to the
temporal records of major economic events [47] or the tim-
ing of events in manufacturing processes and supply chains
[60, 61, 62] or panic [63].

APPENDIX A: PREFERENTIAL SELECTION PROTOCOL

As we discussed in Sect. VIII, one possible modiﬁcation
of the priority model introduced and studied in Sect. VI in-
volves the assumption that we do not always choose the high-
est priority task for execution, but rather the tasks are chosen
stochastically, in increasing function of their priority. That is,
the probability to choose a task with priority x for execution
xγ, where γ is a predeﬁned parameter
in a unit time is Π(x)
of the model. This parameter allows us to interpolate between
the random choice limit (ii) (γ = 0, p = 0) and the determin-
istic case, when always the highest priority item is chosen for
execution (iii) (γ =
, p = 1). Note that this parameteriza-
tion captures the scaling of the model discussed in Sect. VI
only in the p
1 limits, but not for intermedi-
ate p values. That is, the two limits of this model map into
extreme limits of the model introduced in Sect. VI, but the
intermediate p and γ values do not map into each other.

results (Fig 3a), as well as the empirical data on the email in-
terarrival times (Fig 2a). In the γ = 0 (p = 0) limit tw(x)
is independent of x, thus w(tw) converges to an exponential
distribution, as shown in Fig. 3b.

∼

The apparent dependence of w(tw) on the η(x) distribu-
tion from which the agent chooses the priorities may appear
to represent a potential problem, as assigning priorities is a
subjective process, each individual being characterized by its
own η(x) distribution. According to Eq. (A2), however, in
the γ
limit w(tw) is independent of η(x). Indeed, in the
deterministic limit the uniform η(x) can be transformed into
an arbitrary η′(x) with a parameter change, without altering
the order in which the tasks are executed [31]. This insensi-
tivity of the tail to η(x) explains why, despite the diversity of
human actions, encompassing both professional and personal
priorities, most decision driven processes develop a heavy tail.

APPENDIX B: EXACT SOLUTION OF THE PRIORITY
QUEUE MODEL WITH L = 2

Consider the model discussed in Sect. VI [5] with L = 2
[8]. The task that has been just selected and its priority
has been reassigned will be called the new task, while the
other task will be called the old task. Let η(x) and R(x) =
x
0 dx˜η(x) be the priority probability density function (pdf)
and distribution function of the new tasks, which are given. In
R
x
turn, let ˜η(x, t) and ˜R(x, t) =
0 dx˜η(x, t) be the priority pdf
and distribution function of the old task in the t-th step. At the
R
(t + 1)-th step there are two tasks on the list, their priorities
being distributed according to R(x) and ˜R(x, t), respectively.
After selecting one task the old task will have the distribution

Next we turn our attention to the waiting time distribution.
Consider a task with priority x that has just been added to
the queue. The selection of this task is independent from one
step to the other. Therefore, the probability that it waits τw
steps is given by the product of the probability that it is not
1 steps and that it is selected in the
selected in the ﬁrst τw −
τw-th step. The probability that it is not selected in the ﬁrst
step is ˜q(x), while the probability that it is not selected in
the subsequent steps is q(x). Integrating over the new task’s
possible priorities we obtain

APPENDIX C: THE ASYMPTOTIC CHARACTERISTICS OF

In Sect. VI we focused on a model with ﬁxed queue length

with α = 1. Next we derive a series of results that apply
to any queuing model that has a ﬁnite queue length, and is
characterized by an arbitrary task selection protocol [8]. In

exponential cutoff must accompany the scaling. For example,
for the model discussed above with L = 2 and 0
p < 1 we
have α = 1 and f (x) decays exponentially (9), in line with
the constraint discussed above.

APPENDIX D: TRANSITIONS BETWEEN THE TWO
UNIVERSALITY CLASSES

A basic difference between the models discussed in Sect. V
and Sects. VI is the capacity of the queue. Our results indicate
that the model without limitation on the queue length displays
α = 3/2, rooted in the ﬂuctuations of the queue length. In
contrast, the model with ﬁxed queue length (Sect. VI) has
α = 1, rooted in the queuing of the low priority tasks on the
priority list. If indeed the limitation in the queue length plays
an important role, we should be able to develop a model that
can display a transition from the α = 3/2 to the α = 1 uni-
versality class as we limit the ﬂuctuations in the queue length.
In this section we study such a model, interpolating between
the two observed scaling regimes. We start from the model
discussed in Sect. V, and impose on it a maximum queue
length L. This can be achieved by altering the arrival rate of
the tasks: when there are L tasks in the queue no new tasks
will be accepted until at least one of the tasks is executed.
Mathematically this implies that the arrival rate depends on
the queue length as

waiting time distribution is well approximated by that of the
model with an unlimited queue length, displaying the scaling
predicted by Eq. (4), i.e. either exponential, or a power law
with α = 3/2, coupled with an exponential cutoff (see Fig.
8a).

Critical regime: For ρ = 1 we observe an interesting inter-
play between the queue length and L. Normally in this critical
regime ℓ(t) should follow a random walk with the return time
probability density scaling with exponent 3/2. However, the
limitation imposed on the queue length limits the power law
waiting time distribution predicted by Eq. (4), introducing a
cutoff (see Fig. 8b). Indeed having the number of tasks in the
queue limited allows each task to be executed in a ﬁnite time.

If we take the

model corresponds to the one discussed in Sect. VI, display-

This result is a consequence of the generalized limit theorem

Therefore, the selected task’s waiting time is given by

heavy tail in the waiting time distribution is a consequence of
the heavy tails in the service time distribution.

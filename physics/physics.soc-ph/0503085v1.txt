Abstract

Recently, a continuous dynamics was proposed to simulate dynamics

of interpersonal relations in a society represented by a fully connected

graph. Final state of such a society was found to be identical with the so-

called Heider balance (HB), where the society is divided into two mutually

hostile groups. In the continuous model, a polarization of opinions was

found in HB. Here we demonstrate that the polarization occurs also in

Barab´asi-Albert networks, where the Heider balance is not necessarily

present. In the second part of this work we demonstrate the results of our

formalism, when applied to reference examples: the Southern women and

the Zachary club.

Introduction

The Heider balance [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is a ﬁnal state of personal relations between

members of a society, reached when these relations evolve according to some

dynamical rules. The relations are assumed to be symmetric, and they can be

friendly or hostile. The underlying psycho-sociological mechanism of the rules is

an attempt of the society members to remove a cognitive dissonance, which we

feel when two of our friends hate each other or our friend likes our enemy. As a

1

result of the process, the society is split into two groups, with friendly relations

within the groups and hostile relations between the groups. As a special case,

the size of one group is zero, i.e. all hostile relations are removed. HB is the ﬁnal

state if each member interacts with each other; in the frames of the graph theory,

where the problem is formulated, the case is represented by a fully connected

graph.

Recently a continuous dynamics has been introduced to describe the time

evolution of the relations [6]. In this approach, the relations between nodes i and

jwere represented by matrix elements r(i, j), which were real numbers, friendly

(r(i, j) > 0) or hostile (r(i, j) < 0). As a consequence of the continuity, we

observed a polarization of opinions: the absolute values of the matrix elements

r(i, j) increase. Here we continue this discussion, but the condition of maximal

connectivity is relaxed, as it could be unrealistic in large societies. The purpose

of ﬁrst part of this work is to demonstrate, that even if HB is not present,

the above mentioned polarization remains true. In Section II we present new

numerical results for a society of N = 100 members, represented by Barab´asi-

Albert (BA) network [7]. Although this size of considered social structure is

rather small, it is suﬃcient to observe some characteristics which are diﬀerent

than those in the exponential networks. In second part (Section III) we compare

the results of our equations of motion with some examples, established in the

literature of the subject. The Section is closed by ﬁnal conclusions.

2 Calculations for Barab´asi-Albert networks

where R is a sociologically justiﬁed limitation on the absolute value of r(i, j)

[6]. Here R = 5.0.

Initial values of r(i, j) are random numbers, uniformly

distributed in the range (−0.5, 0.5). The equation is solved numerically with

the Runge-Kutta IV method with variable length of timestep [8], simultaneously

2

for all pairs (i, j) of linked nodes. The method of construction of BA networks

was described in [9]. The connectivity parameter is selected to be M = 7,

because in this case the probability p(M ) of HB has a clear minimum for BA

networks of N = 100 nodes, and p(M = 7) ≈ 0.5 (see Fig. 1). This choice of

M is motivated by our aim to falsify the result on the polarization of opinions.

This polarization was demonstrated [6] to be a consequence of HB; therefore,

the question here is if it appears also when HB is not present. An example of

time evolution of such a network is shown in Fig. 2.

Our result is that the polarization is present in all investigated cases. As

time increases, the distribution of r(i, j) gets wider and ﬁnally it reaches a

stable shape, with two large peaks at r(i, j) ≈ ±R and one smaller peak at the

centre, where r(i, j) ≈ 0. In Fig. 3, we show a series of histograms of r(, j) in

subsequent times (A-E). Particular networks diﬀer quantitatively with respect

to the heights of the peaks, but these diﬀerences are small.

We note here that when some links are absent, the deﬁnition of HB should

be somewhat relaxed, because some other links, which do not enter to any triad

(i, j, k), will not evolve at all. Therefore we should admit that some negative

relations survive within a given group. We classify a ﬁnal state of the graph as

HB if there are no chains of friendly relations between the subgroups. On the

other hand, more than two mutually hostile subgroups can appear. These facts

were recognized already in literature [3, 5]. Surprisingly enough, subgroups of

1 < N < 97 nodes are never found in our BA networks. On the contrary, in

the exponential networks groups of all sizes were detected. In Figs. 4 and 5 we

show diagrams for BA networks and exponential networks, respectively. Each

point at these diagrams marks the value of r(i, j) and the size of the subgroup

which contains nodes (i, j). Links between diﬀerent subgroups are omitted. We

see that for BA networks (Fig.4), the lowest value of N is 97. The remaining

three nodes are linked with all other nodes by hostile relations.

3 Examples

In Ref.

[6], an example of polarization of opinions on the lustration law in

Poland in 1999 was brought up. The presented statistical data [10] displayed two

maxima at negative and positive opinions and a lower value at the centre of the

plot. In our simulations performed for fully connected graphs [6], the obtained

value for the center was zero. However, it is clear that in any group larger

than, say, 50 persons some interpersonal relations will be absent. Taking this

into account, we can claim than the statistical data of [10] should be compared

to the results discussed here rather than to those for a fully connected graph.

Here we reproduce a peak of the histogram at its centre, on the contrary to

the results in [6]. This fact allows to speak on a qualitative accordance of the

results of our calculations with the statistical data of [10].

Next example is the set of data of the attendance of 18 ’Southern women’ in

local meetings in Natchez, Missouri, USA in 1935 [11]. These data were used to

compare 21 methods of ﬁnding social groups. The results were analysed with

respect to their consensus, and ranked with consensus index from 0.543 (much

worse than all others) to 0.968. To apply our dynamics, we use the correlation

function < p(i, j) > − < p(i) >< p(j) > as initial values of r(i, j). Our method

produced the division (1-9) against (10-18), what gives the index value 0.968.

As a by-product, the method can provide the time dynamics of the relations

till HB and, once HB is reached, the leadership within the cliques [12]. We

should add that actually, we have no data on the possible friendship or hostility

between these women, then the interpretation of these results should be done

with care.

Last example is the set of data about a real conﬂict in the Zachary karate

club [13, 14, 15]. The input data are taken from [16]. All initial values of the

matrix elements are reduced by a constant ǫ to evade the case of overwhelm-

ing friendship. The obtained splitting of the group is exactly as observed by

Zachary: (1-8,11-14,17,18,20,22) against (9,10,15,16,19,21,23-34). These results

were checked not to vary for ǫ between 1.0 and 3.0. The status of all group

members can be obtained with the same method as in the previous example.

4

To conclude, the essence of Eq. (1) is the nonlinear coupling between links

r(i, j), which produces the positive feedback between the actual values of the

relations and their time evolution. We should add that the idea of such a

feedback is not entirely new.

It is present, for example, in Boltzmann-like

nonlinear master equations applied to behavioral models [17]. On the contrary,

it is absent in later works on formal theory of social inﬂuence [18]. On the other

hand, the theories of status [12] are close to the method of transition matrix,

known in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics [19].

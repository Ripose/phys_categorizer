We study the long-term memory in diverse stock market indices and foreign exchange rates using
the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis(DFA). For all daily and high-frequency market data studied,
no signiﬁcant long-term memory property is detected in the return series, while a strong long-term
memory property is found in the volatility time series. The possible causes of the long-term
memory property are investigated using the return data ﬁltered by the AR(1) model, reﬂecting
the short-term memory property, and the GARCH(1,1) model, reﬂecting the volatility clustering
property, respectively. Notably, we found that the memory eﬀect in the AR(1) ﬁltered return and
volatility time series remains unchanged, while the long-term memory property either disappeared
or diminished signiﬁcantly in the volatility series of the GARCH(1,1) ﬁltered data. We also found
that in the high-frequency data the long-term memory property may be generated by the volatility
clustering as well as higher autocorrelation. Our results imply that the long-term memory property
of the volatility time series can be attributed to the volatility clustering observed in the ﬁnancial
time series.

INTRODUCTION

Recently, studies on the hidden or less understood fea-
tures of ﬁnancial time series such as the long-term mem-
ory have been attempted through an interdisciplinary ap-
proach with much attention [1,2].

The presence of the long-term memory means that the
market does not immediately respond to an amount of in-
formation ﬂowing into the ﬁnancial market, but reacts to
it gradually over a period. Therefore, past price changes
can be used as a signiﬁcant information for the predic-
tion of future price changes. In addition, this observation
is signiﬁcant in that it can provide negative evidence as
well as a new perspective to the Eﬃcient Market Hy-
pothesis (EMH) [6]. Previous works have not found a
signiﬁcant long-term memory in the returns of ﬁnancial
time series. However, most of their volatility time series
are found to show a strong long-term memory [13-22].
The analysis of the return time interval in the stock re-
turns showed that the long-term memory of the volatility
is closely related to the clustering eﬀect of return time
intervals [11,12]. In order to investigate the presence of
the long-term memory property in ﬁnancial time series
and its possible causes, we used diverse daily and high-
frequency market indices. We used daily data from eight

international stock market indices from 1991 to 2005 and
the foreign exchange rates of 31 countries to the US dol-
lar from 1990 to 2000, as well as high-frequency data in-
cluding the KOSPI 1-minute market index from 1995 to
2002, the KOSDAQ 1-minute market index from 1997 to
2004, and the foreign exchange rates of six nations to the
US dollar from 1995 to 2004. To quantify the long-term
memory property in ﬁnancial time series, we utilized the
Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA), which was intro-
duced by Peng et al. [23]. Previous studies on ﬁnancial
time series has found diverse features that deviate from
the random walk process, such as autocorrelation, volatil-
ity clustering, fat tails and so forth, which were called as
stylized facts [3,4,5].

Among the several stylized facts, we used data ﬁl-
tered through the Autoregressive (AR) model and the
Generalized Autoregressive Conditional heteroscedastic-
ity (GARCH) model, reﬂecting short-term memory and
volatility clustering, respectively, which are widely used
in the ﬁnancial ﬁeld [8,9]. We found that for all types of
data used in this paper, Hurst exponents of the return
series follow a random walk process, while the volatility
series exhibit the long memory property with Hurst ex-
ponents in 0.7 ≤ H ≤ 0.9. In order to test the possible
causes of the occurrence of the long-term memory prop-
erty observed in the volatility time series, we used the
returns series ﬁltered through AR(1) and GARCH(1,1)
models. The long-term memory property was no longer
observed in the volatility time series of the daily data
ﬁltered through the GARCH(1,1) model, while it is con-
siderably reduced with 0.6 ≤ H ≤ 0.65 in the volatility

2

time series of the high-frequency GARCH(1,1) ﬁltered
data. On the other hand, the volatility time series of
the daily and high-frequency data ﬁltered through the
AR(1) model still show the strong long-term memory
property observed in the volatility time series of original
time series. In order to investigate the possible causes of
the diﬀerences between results from the daily and high-
frequency data, we studied the autocorrelation function
for the KOSPI 1-minute market index and the JPY/USD
5-minute foreign exchange rate data. We ﬁnd that the
autocorrelation function from the high-frequency data
exhibits a higher correlation than that from the low-
frequency data.

In the next section, we describe the ﬁnancial data used
in the paper for analysis. In Section III, we introduce
the DFA method, the GARCH model and the AR model
often used in the analysis of ﬁnancial time series.
In
Section IV, we present the results on the presence of the
long-term memory property and the possible causes of its
generation in the ﬁnancial time series. Finally, we end
with the summary.

II. DATA

We used the eight daily international market of 7 coun-
tries indices from 1991 to 2005 (from the Yahoo ﬁnancial
web-site) and the foreign exchange rates of 31 countries
to the US dollar from 1990 to 2000 (from the FRB web-
site), and as high-frequency data, the KOSPI 1-minute
market index in the Korean stock market from 1995 to
2002, the KOSDAQ 1-minute market index from 1997 to
2004 (from the Korean Stock Exchange), and the for-
eign exchange rates of six countries to the US dollar
from 1995 to 2004 (from Olson). The seven interna-
tional market indices are USA (S&P 500, NASDAQ),
Hong Kong (Hangseng), Japan (N ikkei225), Germany
(DAX), France (CAC40), UK (F T SE100), and Ko-
rea (KOSP I). The daily data of the foreign exchange
rates are taken from a total of 31 countries, including
ten countries (ATS, BEF, FIM, FRF, DEM, IEP, ITL,
NLG, PTE, and ESP) from 1990 to 1998, twenty coun-
tries (AUD, CAD, CNY, DKK, GRD, HKD, INR, JPY,
KRW, MYR, NZD, NOK, SGD, ZAR, LKR, SEK, CHF,
TWD, THB, and GBP) from 1990 to 2000, and one
country (BRL) from 1995 to 2000. The 5-minute data
of the foreign exchange rates were taken from six coun-
tries: Euro (EUR), UK (GBP), Japan (JPY), Singapore
(SGD), Switzerland (CHF), and Australia (AUD). As the
ﬁnancial time series data employed in this investigation,
we used the normalized returns, Rt, from the price data,
yt, as in previous studies ;

Rt ≡

ln yt+1 − ln yt
σ(rt)

,

where σ(rt) is the standard deviation of the return. The
normalized returns are composed of the magnitude time

series, |Rt|, and the sign time series, Signt, as follows

Rk,t = |Rk,t| × Signk,t,

(2)

where Rk,t is the return series of the k-th market index
calculated by the log-diﬀerence, |Rk,t|, the magnitude se-
ries of the returns of the k-th market index, and Signk,t,
the sign series with +1 for the upturn and −1 for the
downturn. The volatility of the returns can be studied
though the magnitude series, |Rt|. In this analysis, we
utilized the return series and the volatility series, respec-
tively. Here, for the return series, we make use of the
returns, Rt, from Eq.1 and for the volatility series, we
used its magnitude time series, |Rt|.

III. METHODS

A. Detrended Fluctuation Analysis

In this paper, we utilized the Detrended Fluctuation
Analysis(DFA) method proposed by Peng et al. to quan-
tify the long-term memory property in the ﬁnancial time
series [23]. The Hurst exponent calculated through the
method of DFA can be measured as follows. In the ﬁrst
step, the accumulated value after the subtraction of the
mean, ¯x, from the time series, x(i), is deﬁned by

y(i) =

[x(i) − ¯x].

(3)

N

X
i=1

where N is the number of the time series. In the second
step, the accumulated time series is divided into boxes of
the same length n. In each box of length n, the trend is
estimated using the ordinary least square method. That
is, DFA(m) is determined, where m is the ﬁltering order.
In each box, the ordinary least square line is expressed as
yn(i). By subtracting yn(i) from the accumulated y(i) in
each box, the trend is removed. This process is applied
to every box and the ﬂuctuation magnitude is deﬁned as

F (n) =

[y(i) − yn(i)]2.

The process of the second step is repeated for every
scale n and the following scaling relationship is deﬁned
by

F (n) ≈ cnH ,

(5)

(1)

where H is the Hurst exponent. The Hurst exponent
ranges from 0 to 1, which reﬂects diﬀerent correlation
characteristics. If 0 ≤ H < 0.5, the time series is anti-
persistent. If 0.5 < H ≤ 1, it is persistent. In the case of
H = 0.5, it becomes a random walk.

B. Generalized Autoregressive Conditional
Heteroscedasticity and Autoregressive Model

The GARCH model proposed by Bollerslev has been
widely used in the ﬁnancial literature up to now, which
includes the volatility clustering property observed in the
empirical ﬁnancial time series [9]. The volatility is a pa-
rameter basically used to evaluate the risk of diverse ﬁ-
nancial assets, so the reliable estimation of volatility is a
signiﬁcant task in the ﬁnancial ﬁeld. The GARCH model
introduced by Bollerslev is deﬁned as follows:

yt = µ + ǫt,

ǫt ≡ ηtσt,

where ǫt is a random process with zero mean, and unit
variance, yt is the return and σ2
t is the volatility at time
t. As shown in Eq. 6, the conditional heteroscedasticity
based on past volatility, σ2
t , can be explained not only by
the square of an error term with a lag (ǫ2
t−i, i = 1, 2, ...., p)
but also by the conditional heteroscedasticity with a lag
(σ2
t−j , j = 1, 2, ...., q ). In general, the case with p=1 and
q=1 are often considered in empirical investigations of
the ﬁnancial ﬁeld, so that the GARCH(1,1) model is used
in our analysis. In addition, we obtained the standard-
ized residual term (ǫ∗
t is the normal-
ized standard deviation) after ﬁltering the return data
through the GARCH(1,1) model and computed the Hurst
exponent by the DFA method. As the GARCH model
reﬂects the volatility clustering property included in the
ﬁnancial time series, the residual term, ǫ∗
t , turns out to
be the time series data without the volatility clustering
property. On the other hand, the AR(m) model reﬂects
the autocorrelation in ﬁnancial time series, which corre-
sponds to the short-term memory. The AR(m) model is
deﬁned by

t , where σ∗

t = ǫt/σ∗

rt = α0 +

βkrt−k + ǫt,

(7)

m

X
k=1

where ǫt is the normal distribution with the zero mean
and the variance one. In particular, in the case with β1 =
1 in the AR(1) model, rt follows a random walk process.
In this paper, we employ the AR(1) model often used in
the empirical studies in ﬁnancial ﬁelds. After ﬁltering
the return data through the AR(1) model, we obtain the
residual term, ǫt. Since the AR(1) model reﬂects the
short-term memory property contained in the ﬁnancial
time series, the residual term, ǫt, becomes the time series
without the short-term memory property.

IV. RESULTS

In this section, we investigate the long-term memory
property using the DFA method in the ﬁnancial time se-
ries of stock markets and foreign exchange markets and
present the results on the possible causes of its generation
using data ﬁltered through the AR(1) and GARCH(1,1)
models. First, we create time series data with only
the speciﬁed memory property, with the given Hurst ex-
ponent, using the Fractional Brownian Motion (FBM)
model.
In Fig.1, we shows computed Hurst exponents
through the DFA method from the data decomposed into
the return time series and the volatility time series, re-
spectively. In Fig.1, the Hurst exponents of the volatility
time series are larger than those of the return time se-
ries in the region with 0 ≤ H < 0.5, but are smaller in
the region with 0.5 < H ≤ 1. In Fig. 2, we show that
the long-term memory property of the returns and the
volatility by using the DFA method on daily and high-
frequency stock market data. The results on the possi-
ble causes of its generation are also presented using the
data ﬁltered through the AR(1) and GARCH(1,1) mod-
els. Fig. 2(a) shows the Hurst exponents measured from
the return and the volatility of eight daily international
market indices. All the Hurst exponents from the orig-
inal return time series (red circles), the AR(1) ﬁltered
data (green triangles) and the GARCH(1,1) ﬁltered data
(black crosses) give H ≃ 0.5, So that there is no the long-
term memory property. On the other hand, we observe

a strong long-term memory property with 0.8 ≤ H ≤ 0.9
in both the original data on the volatility time series
(red squares) and the AR(1) ﬁltered data (green inverse
triangles). Notably, we discover no the long-term mem-
ory property with H ≃ 0.5 in the GARCH(1,1) ﬁltered
data (black diamonds). These results suggest that the
volatility clustering may be a possible cause for the gen-
erations of the long-term memory property observed in
the volatility time series.

the returns and the volatility of the one-minute high-
frequency market indices of Korea, KOSPI and KOS-
DAQ. The long-term memory property cannot be ob-
served in the return time series as shown in Fig. 2(b).

Furthermore, the original volatility time series (red
squares) and the AR(1) ﬁltered data (green inverse tri-
angles) display a similar strong long-term memory prop-
erty. However, in this case the GARCH(1,1) ﬁltered
data (black diamonds) still possess the long-term memory
property with H ≈ 0.65 albeit reduced from H ≈ 0.75
observed in the orginal data. Note that it is hard to ob-
serve this diﬀerence in low-frequency ﬁnancial time series
like daily data.

case of daily and high-frequency foreign exchange mar-
ket data. Fig. 3(a) shows the Hurst exponents from
daily data for foreign exchange rates to the US dollar
for 31 countries from 1990 to 2000. Fig. 3(b) shows

the Hurst exponents from the original return time se-
ries (red circle), AR(1) ﬁltered data (green triangles),
and GARCH(1,1) ﬁltered data (black crosses) become
H ≈ 0.5, so that the long-term memory property is not
present. The long-term memory property, however, is
found in the volatility time series (red square) and the
AR(1) ﬁltered data (green inverse triangles). On the
other hand, in the case of the GARCH(1,1) ﬁltered data
(black diamonds), the long-term memory property is not
observed with, H ≈ 0.5, in daily data. However, in the
5-minute data, the long-term memory property is found
to persist with, H ≈ 0.6, albeit reduced. This result is
similar to the case of stock market indices.

All the ﬁnancial time series data including the stock
markets and the foreign exchange markets used in this
investigation show a signiﬁcant long-term memory prop-
erty in the volatility time series, while not in the return
time series. We found that the long-term memory prop-
erty disappeared or diminished for the GARCH(1,1) ﬁl-
tered data in the volatility time series. This suggests
that the long-term memory property in the volatility

5

time series can be attributed to the volatility clustering
empirically observed in the ﬁnancial time series. Then,
we observed the diﬀerence between the results of the
GARCH(1,1) ﬁltered data in using low-frequency data,
like daily data, and those in using high-frequency data,
like 5-minute or 1-minute data. This diﬀerence does not
show up well in the low-frequency ﬁnancial time series
but makes us consider the possible presence of other addi-
tional factors that can be observed in the high-frequency
ﬁnancial time series.

In Fig.

4, we shows in a log-log plot the auto-
correlation function for high-frequency and low-frequency
data from the KOSPI 1-minute index from 1995 to 2002
and each of the USD/YEN 5-minute index from 1995 to
2004. In Fig. 4 (a) and (b), the red circles and the black
squares denote the high-frequency and the low-frequency
data, respectively. We found that the autocorrelation
function from high-frequency data has a higher autocor-
relation than that from low-frequency data. The volatil-
ity clustering property is a signiﬁcant factor generating
the long-term memory property of the volatility time se-
ries.
In the high-frequency ﬁnancial time series, other
additional attributes such as a higher correlation, be-
sides the volatility clustering property, may be additional
causes of its generation.

V. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we have investigated the long-term mem-
ory property and the possible causes of its generation in
the return time series and the volatility time series using
both low-frequency (daily) and high-frequency (5-minute
and 1-minute) ﬁnancial time series data of stock mar-
kets and foreign exchange markets. We employed the
detrended ﬂuctuation analysis (DFA) method to quan-
tify the long-term memory property and the AR(1) and
GARCH(1,1) models to remove the short-term memory
property and the volatility clustering eﬀect, respectively,
as the possible causes of its generation.

We found that the returns time series employed in this
investigation have the Hurst exponent with H = 0.5,
while the volatility time series have a long-term mem-
ory property with Hurst exponent with 0.7 ≤ H ≤ 0.9.
To investigate the possible causes of the generation of
the long-term memory observed in this volatility time se-
ries, we employed the AR(1) and GARCH(1,1) models.
We found that the observed long-term memory property
disappeared or diminished for the GARCH(1,1) ﬁltered
data. This suggests that the long-term memory property
observed in the volatility time series can be attributed
to the volatility clustering property. The previous re-
search attempted to explain qualitatively that the long-
term memory property of the volatility time series is re-
lated to the volatility clustering eﬀect. Our results sug-
gest that the long-term memory of volatility time series
is related to the volatility clustering, one of the stylized
facts. Furthermore, in the case of the high-frequency ﬁ-

6

nancial time series, long-term memory property may be
attributed to a higher autocorrelation and other factors
such as long-tails in ﬁnancial time series, which warrants
further study.

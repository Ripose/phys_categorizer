Abstract

We follow up on the study of correlations between GDP’s of rich countries, as studied in refs.

[1-3]. We analyze web-downloaded data on GDP that we use as individual wealth signatures of the

country economical state. We calculate the yearly ﬂuctuations of the GDP. We look for forward

and backward correlations between such ﬂuctuations. The system is represented by an evolving

network, nodes being the GDP ﬂuctuations (or countries) at diﬀerent times.

In order to extract structures from the network, we focus on ﬁltering the time delayed correlations

by removing the least correlated links. This percolation idea-based method reveals the emergence

of connections, that are visualized by a branching representation. Note that the network is made

of weighted and directed links when taking into account a delay time. Such a measure of collective

habits does not ﬁt the usual expectations deﬁned by politicians or economists.

INTRODUCTION

Some time ago, the question of economy globalization was studied along the lines of

macro-econophysics research [1, 2, 3]. Other considerations along related lines can be found

in these proceedings in contributions by Miskiewicz [4] and Gligor [5]. The question pertains

to well known observations: there are political, cultural, scientiﬁc, economic cooperations

all over the world, even though there are even anti-globalization organizations.

In our case, we consider that a globalizationprocess in economy should be understood

as an increase of similarities within (macroeconomy) development patterns. In so doing we

have proposed to study whether the pattern economy of countries was well represented by

the distance between ﬂuctuations of their country Normalized Gross Domestic Products

(GDP). The notion of distance is somewhat arbitrary, as has been already discussed in [1],

but is left for further investigation elsewhere. We have chosen to present here a study based

on the statistical distance, in Sec. II, for the 23 most developed countries for which annual

GDP data is available in the interval [1950 − 2003].

One might argue [6] that some data detrending is necessary to take into account cycle

like eﬀects [7, 8]. In previous studies [1] it has been observed that there is much noise is

the data. We have shown that some average should be taken over large time windows to

remove such a noise. We will use an average time of T = 4 years. One usual political

question is whether one has to f ollow another country policy in order to improve one’s

country economy. The question of followers and leaders can be tackle by considering time

delayed correlations. In this ﬁrst attempt we will only consider a one year time lag τ , being

aware that other time lags should be involved. Note that positive or negative ones should

be considered. Nevertheless it is worthwhile to check whether such an approach is already

meaningful for τ = 1 and τ = −1.

The system thus looks like an evolving network, nodes being the GDP ﬂuctuations or, in

a short way, countries at diﬀerent times. In Sec. III, we extract structures from the network

through ﬁltering the time delayed correlations (or distance matrix) by removing the least

correlated links. This percolation idea-based method reveals the emergence of connections,

that are visualized by a branching representation. However the system is pretty unstable.

Yet, expected features are reproduced. This should imply some further consideration in the

line of Glansdorﬀ and Prigogine [9] about Structure and Stability of world economic systems

2

and the intrinsic role of ﬂuctuations. Notice also that the network is much more complex

when taking into account delay time. Indeed the correlation matrix is NOT symmetrical,

whence the network links are not only weighted but also directed. The number of distances

to be considered is N(N −1), where N is the number of countries, in contrast to N(N −1)/2,

when τ = 0. In Sec. IV, we conclude that such a measure of collective habits does not ﬁt

the usual expectations deﬁned by politicians but that does not imply that they are wrong

or right, nor are we.

We stress that several times must be truly considered, i.e.

1. Initial observation time t0

2. Data acquisition time t

3. Increment or ﬂuctuation time span ∆

4. Delay time (between two countries) t

′

5. Window observation (averaging) time T , i.e. [tmin, tM ax]

6. Conclusion time tN

Thus the correlation matrix is of quite high dimension (i, j; t0; t, t

, τ ;...)

METHODOLOGY

We use data from http://www.ggdc.net/index-series.html for Normalized Gross Domestic

Product (GDP) of the 21 most developed countries. Most of countries have natural time

scales associated to the time lags between elections. Whence we use an average time of
T = 4 years. For each of the countries, let us deﬁne pi;t = ln Gi;t+T
Gi;t

that is equivalent to the

average variation of the GDP over T years.

Let us now introduce a correlation measure and associated distance measure for the

countries. The correlation measure is based on the Theil index and is deﬁned as follows

Ci,j;t,τ =

The ”averaging time” ∆ has been hereby chosen to be ∆ = 4 in the following. The distance

is obtained from the correlation from the deﬁnition:

Let us stress that this short hand writing accounts for time delays between the signals.

Let us also note that other measures of distance between diﬀerent countries can be deﬁned,

e.g

Di,j;t,τ = |pi;t − pj;t+τ |

, but we will focus on the deﬁnition 1 and 3 in the present paper. The comparison of results

obtained for diﬀerent measures will be considered elsewhere.

When τ = 0, the above quantities are at ﬁxed time. When τ 6= 0, these quantities measure

the correlations with a delay time between the economies of countries. If the evolutions were

completely identical, one would ﬁnd D = 0. Let us stress again that Di,j;t,τ is symmetric in

i, j, when τ = 0. For each pair of countries, this quantity deﬁnes therefore a surface whose

statistical properties can be studied.

The ﬁrst relevant quantity to report is the rank analysis of Di,j;t,τ , at diﬀerent values of t

(1974, 1984, 1994) and τ = 0, 1, -1. (Figs. 1,2) Notice the non trivial behavior, with various

crossing of the curves, and the Zipf (log-log) plot, that does not lead to a ﬁne straight line

ﬁt. Because the GDP increment distance between countries is rather uniform, this suggests

similarities in development patterns, which likely result from interactions of economies, in a

globalization sense.

CLUSTERING ANALYSIS

At ﬁxed times, and ﬁxed values of the delay τ , pairs of countries (i,j) are characterized

by their relative distance. In order to extract structures from the distance matrix, we build

country networks through ﬁltering the time delayed correlation matrix by removing the least

correlated links through moving a threshold.

of the ﬁltering f are respectively 0.45, 0.20, 0.15 and 0.1

the weak links. By decreasing the values of f , one observes therefore the breaking of the

continent into several islands that correspond to very connected ”communities of countries”.

Let us stress that this method has already been successfully applied in order to reveal

structures in online communities [10]. Contrary to this previous study, the distance matrix

may be asymmetric when τ 6= 0. Consequently, the network representation will be made

of directed links from i to j, if the matrix element Dij veriﬁes Dij < f . This percolation

idea-based method reveals the emergence of connections, that are visualized by a branching

representation. In Fig.4, this method is shown for the parameters t = 1984, τ = 1.

CONCLUSIONS

In this short paper, we have introduced techniques in order to study the development of

structures in macro-economical systems. To do so, we have considered the GDP’s of the 23

most developed countries, and deﬁned statistical distances between their time evolution. A

possible delay between economies has been accounted for through the parameter τ , thereby

allowing the distinction between leading and following countries.

In the above analysis, we have observed that the rank distribution is unexpectedly giving

an exponent diﬀerent from the classical Zipf law (=-1), and that the data contain a lot of

noise. Nevertheless, patterns have been found, under the form of clusters in the countries’

network. This structuring seems to be in line with economy globalization, that tends to

homogenize the economic development of countries, and may be related to the inﬂuence of

political considerations.

Clearly, other values of the time lag should be examined, and not so rich countries as

well. There is no reason that the same time lag should be considered for diﬀerent countries.

In fact one could look for higher order time delayed correlation functions.

Finally, let us stress that there are many possible approaches, that could help the under-

standing of globalization processes in economy. A classical way in searching for clusters is

to ﬁnd subgraphs with a high clustering coeﬃcient or to investigate the graph topology.

We investigate a generalized stochastic model with the property known as mean reversion, that
is, the tendency to relax towards a historical reference level. Besides this property, the dynamics
is driven by multiplicative and additive Wiener processes. While the former is modulated by the
internal behavior of the system, the latter is purely exogenous. We focus on the stochastic dynamics
of volatilities, but our model may also be suitable for other ﬁnancial random variables exhibiting the
mean reversion property. The generalized model contains, as particular cases, many early approaches
in the literature of volatilities or, more generally, of mean-reverting ﬁnancial processes. We analyze
the long-time probability density function associated to the model deﬁned through a Itˆo-Langevin
equation. We obtain a rich spectrum of shapes for the probability function according to the model
parameters. We show that additive-multiplicative processes provide realistic models to describe
empirical distributions, for the whole range of data.

INTRODUCTION

Accurate statistical description of the stochastic dy-
namics of stock prices is fundamental to investment, op-
tion pricing and risk management. In particular, a rel-
evant quantity is the volatility of price time series[1],
that quantiﬁes the propensity of the market to ﬂuctuate.
Since volatility represents a measure of the risk associ-
ated to the ﬂuctuating dynamics of prices, it is crucial to
develop suitable models to predict its complex intermit-
tent behavior. There is empirical evidence that it ﬂuc-
tuates following a stochastic dynamics subjacent to that
of prices, whose dynamics, in turn, depends on the time
evolving volatility. Many approaches are based on that
assumption[2], although others propose the existence of
a reciprocal feedback between both processes[3].

Our approach builds on the development of a simple
Langevin equation to characterize the stochastic process
of volatility. The equation provides an unifying descrip-
tion that generalizes widely discussed models in the liter-
ature. We analyze the shape of the long-time probability
density function (PDF) associated to the stochastic dif-
ferential equation that characterizes each particular case
of the generalized model. Most previous results focus on
the tails of the PDFs. In fact, for stochastic variables,
such as volatilities presenting fat-tailed PDFs[4, 5], it is
specially important to reproduce extreme events in a real-
istic model. Now we go a step further and aim to predict
the PDFs in the whole range of events.

One of the main features observed in the dynamics of
some ﬁnancial variables, such as volatilities, stock vol-
umes or interest rates, is their tendency to permanently
relax, towards a reference level θ, a property known as

mean reversion. Another feature is the multiplicative
market processing of random news, whose strength be-
comes modulated by a function of the stochastic variable
itself. These two properties are modeled by means of a
nonlinear mean-reverting force and nonlinear multiplica-
tive noise. They are discussed in detail in Sect. II.

In Sect. III, we discuss the shapes of the PDFs that
such family of models yields. Despite being of a gen-
eral form, they give rise to PDFs that, decay exponen-
tially fast, either above the mode, below it, or both, in
disagreement with empirical observations. For instance,
log-normal behavior has been reported for volatility com-
puted from global data of S&P500[4], at intermediate val-
ues. However, at high values, a power-law behavior, with
exponent outside the stable L´evy range, was observed.
The same analysis performed for individual companies[4]
yields also power-law tails. But in that case, the results
show a variation slower than log-normal below the mode,
suggesting a power-law also in the limit of small values.
The volatility of capitalized stocks traded in US equity
markets exhibits similar features[6]. Other variables with
mean-reversion, such as volume of transactions (number
of trades) present akin distributions. Power-law tails out
of the L´evy range have been reported for the PDFs of
normalized NYSE stock volumes[7]. More recently, stud-
ies of normalized volumes, performed over high resolu-
tion data (1-3 minutes) of NYSE and NASDAQ[8] (see
also [9]), display PDFs with power-law behavior both at
large and small values. We will show that the class of
multiplicative processes considered in Sect. III, although
general enough, is not able to reproduce, for any value of
its parameters, these empirical PDFs in the whole range.
In a realistic model, we must deal with various sources
of ﬂuctuations acting upon the collective variable. Then,
we propose to include a component that is lacking to suit-
ably model many real processes, that is the presence of
ﬂuctuations that act additively, besides the multiplica-
tive noise already taken into account. The latter origi-

nates from the internal correlated behavior of the mar-
ket, representing a sort of endogenous feed-back eﬀect,
while additive noise concerns ﬂuctuations of purely exter-
nal origin or random speculative trading. Then, in Sect.
IV, we present a further generalization that consists in
incorporating an independent additive source of noise.
Depending on the parameters of the process, the addi-
tive or multiplicative contributions will play the domi-
nant role. This gives rise to a rich spectrum of PDF
shapes, in particular, a subclass with two-fold power-law
behavior, both above and below the mode, providing a
general realistic framework for describing the shape of
empirical distributions. A comparison with experimen-
tal results is presented in Sect. V. Finally, Sect. VI
contains the main conclusions and general remarks.

II. MEAN REVERSION AND
MULTIPLICATIVE FLUCTUATIONS

The reversion to the mean is one of the basic ingredi-
ents to describe the dynamics of several stochastic vari-
ables of interest in economy. It is fundamental since it
concerns the behavior around a central value θ and re-
ﬂects the global market response to deviations from a
consensus or equilibrium level. It depends on monetary
unit, market size, degree of risk aversion, etc., hence, it is
characteristic of each market. The aversion to deviations
from the mean needs not be linear, specially when large
deviations are involved. Similarly, a nonlinear mecha-
nism due to the cooperative behavior of traders, rules
the way the market modulates the amplitude of ﬂuctua-
tions (mainly external) giving rise to innovations.

We consider the general class of stochastic diﬀerential

equations given by

such that
= 2dt. The deﬁni-
h
tion of the stochastic process is completed by the Itˆo
prescription. This class generalizes well-known models
employed to describe the dynamics of mean-reverting ﬁ-
nancial variables[10]. In particular, some traditional pro-
cesses for modeling volatilities or, mainly, squared volatil-
ities are the Hull-White (r = 1, s = 1)[11] and the Heston
(r = 1, s = 1/2)[12] models, the latter also known ei-
ther as Cox-Ingersoll-Ross[13] or Feller process[14]. The
arithmetic (r = 1, s = 0) and geometric (r = 2, s = 1)
Ornstein-Ulhenbeck processes are particular cases too.
Moreover, several other models employed in the litera-
ture of volatilities are related to this class[6, 15].

Diﬀerent values of r in Eq. (1) represent diﬀerent pos-
sible relaxation mechanisms of amplitude γ, determined,
amongst other factors, by constraints, ﬂux of informa-
tion, stock liquidity and risk aversion, which are partic-
ular of a given market. Notice that the restoring force
(1) corresponds to a conﬁning potential, with
in Eq.

2

∈

R. The larger r, the more at-
minimum at θ, for all r
tractive the potential for large x, but the less attractive
for vanishing x. Similarly, diﬀerent values of s specify
the market informational connectivity, which conditions
the degree of coherent multiplicative behavior. Models in
the literature typically set s
0, meaning that the eﬀec-
≥
tive amplitude of ﬂuctuations increases with x. Negative
s makes multiplicative ﬂuctuations grow with decreasing
x, thus it mainly reﬂects a cooperative reaction to qui-
escence. Although it does not seem to reﬂect a realistic
steady state of the market, it may occur as a transient,
driven by speculative trading.

−

The two mechanisms are complementary. If r < 0 the
restoring force decreases for increasing x above the ref-
erence level, in particular, for r <
1, the force tends
to zero in the limit of large x. Thus, decreasing r repre-
sents markets that, become less able to recover the refer-
ence level by means of the deterministic tendency alone.
However, a strong multiplicative response to large ﬂuc-
tuations (positive s) could still compensate that inability
and restore the market historical level. Concerning the
response to small values, the restoring force diverges at
the origin if r < 1, while for r > 1, it vanishes at x = 0,
meaning that this point becomes an unstable equilibrium
state. This corresponds to a market indiﬀerent to low lev-
els of trading activity. Again, this eﬀect can be balanced
by the multiplicative contribution (with a small value of
parameter s).

In early works, only very particular values of (r, s)
have been considered. However, this may be sometimes
owed more to reasons of mathematical solvability, than
to econophysical ones. Following the above discussion,
(r, s) may be non-universal, depending on the particular
nature of a market or its agents. Therefore, we will not
discard any possibility a priori.

III. GENERALIZED MULTIPLICATIVE
PROCESS WITH MEAN REVERSION

We consider the simple class of stochastic multiplica-
tive diﬀerential equations given by Eq. (1), that gener-
alizes many processes usually found in the literature of
volatilities. We investigate, in this Section, the long-time
PDFs that this class of processes yields. The Fokker-
Planck equation associated to Eq. (1), following standard
methods[16], is

∂tρ = γ∂x([x

θ]xr−1ρ) + µ2∂2

xx[x2sρ] .

(2)

−

Its long-term solution is relevant in connection to the
assumption that the process can be treated as quasi-
stationary. In that case the PDF obtained from an ac-
tual data series will coincide with the stationary solution.
Considering reﬂecting boundary conditions at x = 0 and

[16], the steady state solution of Eq. (2) reads:

by Eq. (3), in (s, r)-plane. Unshadowed regions and dotted

tion. At the positive r-axis, the PDF is ﬁnite at the origin.
Tilted lines denote the marginal cases r = 2s (p = 0), with
pure exponential tail and power-law growth at the origin, and
r = 2s − 1 (p = −1), with power-law tail and exponential of
1/x growth at the origin (the threshold points of these lines
have coordinates ([1 + γµθ]/2, 0) and ([1 − γµ]/2, 0), respec-
tively). Parameter a > 0, in the exponential formulas, as
well as the power-law exponents, depend on model parame-
ters. Symbols correspond to the special processes: Hull-White
(HW), Heston (H), Ornstein-Ulhenbeck (OU) and geometric
OU (GOU).

The class of processes described by Eq. (3) thus gener-
ically yields asymptotic exponential-like behaviors for
small or/and large values. As soon as p + 1 > 0, a
stretched exponential decay is obtained for large enough
x, such that the argument of the exponential is propor-

Fig. 1 displays the possible PDF asymptotic shapes
in (s, r) space. Notice that the s = 0 axis gives the
solution for mean-reverting models with purely additive
ﬂuctuations. Let us analyze some special cases. In the
trivial case (s, r) = (0, 1), corresponding to the Ornstein-
Ulhenbeck process [16]

the noisy contribution becomes additive and the station-
ary PDF is Gaussian (truncated at x = 0).

Although we are dealing with θ > 0, it is worth of
mention the case (θ, s, r) = (0, 1, 1), corresponding to the
geometric Brownian process, that leads to the log-normal
distribution.

−

For type I (r = 2s

1), notice that the PDF decays
as a power law, for large x, and goes to zero faster than
power law, for vanishing x. The power-law exponent is
controlled by s and γµ, that is, all the model parameters,
except θ are involved. In the particular case r = s = 1,
one recovers the Hull-White process[11]

dx =

γ[x

θ]dt + µxdz .

(7)

−

−

In case II (r = 2s), observe that the PDF has opposite
behavior:
it increases at the origin as a power law and
decays exponentially for large x. All the model parame-
ters, including θ are buried in the power-law exponent. In
particular, if r = 2s = 1, one gets the Heston model[12]

Diverse other models proposed in the literature can
also be thought as particular instances of our generalized
model. For example, the one proposed by Miccich´e et al.
[6] is in correspondence with the Hull-White model (7),
with x representing volatility v, whereas in the latter
v2. Also a family of multiplicative models, stud-
x
ied before in the context of a wide spectrum of phys-
ical processes[17], belongs to the class here considered,
through the transformation x

Summarizing, from Eqs. (3)-(5), in general, the asymp-
totic behaviors below and above the mode are tied, such
that, in a log-log scale, if one ﬂattens the other changes
rapidly. This explains why models of this class fail to
describe empirical volatilities in the whole range of ob-
served data, even under the transformation v2

IV. GENERALIZED MODEL WITH
ADDITIVE-MULTIPLICATIVE STRUCTURE

We analyze in this section, processes that take into
account the presence of some additional source of
noise. Previous works[18, 19, 20] show that additive-
multiplicative stochastic processes constitute an ubiqui-
tous mechanism leading to fat-tailed distributions and
correlated sequences. This extra noise represents a quite
realistic feature, since, besides noise modulated by the
market, other ﬂuctuations may act directly, additively.
From the stream of news, represented by a noisy signal,
some are ampliﬁed or reduced by cooperative actions,
others incorporated unaltered. Related ideas has been
discussed in Ref. [21]. Also, a model of ﬁnancial markets
that leads to additive-linear-multiplicative processes has
been recently proposed[22], where the noises are identi-
ﬁed with the ﬂuctuating environment and ﬂuctuating in-
teraction network, respectively. In general, the two white
noises are considered uncorrelated. However, they may
even correspond to identical time-series as soon as they
are shifted with a time lag greater than the correlation
time.
In such case, the endogenous noise is expected
to act with a delay due to its very nature of feedback
process, whereas, the additive noise is incorporated im-
mediately, free of signal processing.

By including purely exogenous ﬂuctuations, in the pro-
(1), we obtain the following Itˆo-

In
general, suﬃciently large positive s is required in order
to yield power-law tails, otherwise, stretched exponential
tails prevail, as for the processes considered in Sect. III.
The additive noise does not add new domains with power-
law tails, although regions with stretched exponential law
are excluded or included by the normalization condition.
For vanishing x, the main diﬀerence with purely mul-
tiplicative processes is that, for positive both s and r,
the PDF is truncated at the origin. Notice that, as the
PDF is ﬁnite at the origin, then, if x is identiﬁed with
v2), the PDF for v increases
the squared volatility (x

In general, the class of asymptotic behavior is ruled by
(s, r) that determine the form of market laws. This holds,
of course, as soon as the remaining parameters assume
moderate values. For instance, the factor λ2
γα/γµ
accompanies x2s in the formula for ρ(x) [Eqs. (12)-(14)],
then, extreme values of λ will change the asymptotic
regime. In fact, in the limit α = 0 (negligible additive
noise, corresponding to λ
), diﬀerent laws arise, as
we have seen in the precedent Section.

Summarizing, we have shown the whole picture of
asymptotic behaviors that a general class of additive-
multiplicative processes produce. As a consequence of

5

the extra additive noise, new types of asymptotic behav-
iors emerge. Specially interesting solutions arise in the
1 where two-fold power-law PDFs
marginal cases r = 0,
are found.

−

Moreover, additive-multiplicative processes lead to
higher richness of crossover behaviors, with respect to
purely multiplicative processes. Therefore, the appear-
ance of new PDF shapes exceeds the one resulting from
the mere analysis of the asymptotic regimes. This is spe-
cially important because depending on the values of the
parameters, the true asymptotic regime might fall out-
side the observable range.

V. COMPARISON WITH EMPIRICAL
DISTRIBUTIONS

Let us consider, as paradigm of the PDFs with two-
fold power-law behavior, Eqs. (16) and (18), that have
a simple exact expression. Actually they have the same
functional form, via redeﬁnition of parameters (θ, γα, γµ).
This expression has been recently proposed in the liter-
ature as an ansatz for ﬁtting the distribution of high-
frequency stock-volumes [8], under the form

ρ(x) = ρo

(x/xo)ν

[1 + (q

1)x/xo]

,

q−1

(19)

where, in that speciﬁc application, x is identiﬁed with
normalized stock volume. Therefore, identiﬁcation of the
process for real volumes with one of the models above,
may allow an econophysical interpretation of the ﬁtting

thus, the power-law exponent for small values of x, given
by ν (see Table), increases with γ and θ, and is reduced
by either one of the two noise amplitudes: the additive
noise in process A and the multiplicative one in process
B. The power-law decay (with exponent 1/(q
ν)
for large values of x is ruled by either one of the eﬀec-
tive coeﬃcients γµ (in A) or γα (in B) (see Table). That
is, the tail is fatter, the larger the corresponding noise

amplitude. While in process A the multiplicative noise
aﬀects the tail, in model B it is aﬀected by the additive
noise, oppositely to what happens for small values. This
is related to the sign of s, indicating higher multiplica-
tive feedback for either increasing (A) or decreasing (B)
values of x.

Besides the good agreement already observed for vol-
umes [8, 9], we tested this functional form to daily data
of volatilities reported in the literature[6]. The results
are shown in Fig. 3. In the models we are generalizing,
the variable x is usually identiﬁed with the variance or
squared volatility (x = v2). Then, the resulting PDF for
v is

Fig. 3 shows an excellent agreement between theoreti-
cal and empirical PDFs, for the full range of data. Notice
that the very central part of the distribution is parabolic
in the log-log plot, then a poor statistics at the tails may
mislead to think that the distribution is log-normal.

Underlying dynamics

The satisfactory agreement between the empirical data
and Eq. (20) suggests that processes similar to either A
or B may rule squared-volatility evolution. Hence, let
us look at the explicit form of the ILEs associated to
processes A and B:

In model A, increasing(decreasing) amplitude of the ad-

distribution, whereas model B presents opposite behav-
ior. Thus, for instance, the additive noise has a conﬁning
eﬀect in process A, opposite to the eﬀect observed in
processes with null θ[18].

On the other hand, the distribution has a maximum

Notice that the additive noise does not aﬀect the mode,

Numerical integration of ILEs (21) and (22), by stan-
dard methods[16], shows that both processes produce
time series with bursting or clustering eﬀects, as observed
in real sequences. However, process B may present, for
some values of the parameters, a kind of ergodicity break-
ing, with large jumps to a state basically governed by

additive noise. This occurs because, once x jumps to a
high value, both the restoring force and the eﬀective am-
plitude of multiplicative noise become small as to pull
x back to its reference level. Then, relaxation is slowed
down and the regime of high volatility persists for long
time stretches. Although a process with s < 0 is not
expected to be a realistic model for very long time inter-
vals, it can model, for instance, the transient behavior of
the market around crashes. In fact, process B yields akin
crises. After the crash occurs, this drastic event might
switch the system back to a s

0 regime.

VI. FINAL REMARKS

We have analyzed stochastic models of a quite general
form, with algebraic restoring force and algebraic multi-
plicative noise. A further generalization with the inclu-
sion of an extra source of noise, of standard Wiener type,
has also been analyzed. These additive-multiplicative
processes are built on the basis of realistic features: The
multiplicative noise describes innovations generated by
endogenous mechanisms that amplify or attenuate a ran-
dom signal, depending on the internal state of the sys-
tem. Whereas, the additive noise encodes a direct in-
ﬂuence of external random ﬁelds such as news or sponta-
neous ﬂuctuations due to speculative trading. One of the
goals of this work was to study systematically the PDF
asymptotic solutions of these generalized models. We
have shown that the inclusion of additive noise gives rise
to new PDF shapes, with a richer spectrum of cross-over
behaviors and, in particular, two-fold power-law decays.
The shapes of the PDFs are governed by the eﬀective
market rules parametrized by r and s. These parameters
describe the algebraic nature of the global mean-reverting
strength of the market and the informational coupling
among the traders, respectively. On the other hand,
power-law exponents and coeﬃcients of exponential-like

7

functions depend also on the reduced parameters γµ, γα
and on θ. This means that one may expect universal
behavior among markets that share similar rules (same
r and s) and same rescaled restoring parameters, for a
properly normalized reference level θ. Summarizing, the
additive-multiplicative processes given by Eq. (10) pro-
vide a general realistic framework to describe the shape
of empirical distributions for ﬁnancial, as well as, for
physical systems. An illustrative application to empirical
volatility data was presented in Sect. V, showing excel-
lent results.

The statistical description of a market should include
its dynamical properties such as the temporal decay of
correlations.
In real time series of volatilities[4] and
volumes[7], power-law decaying correlations have been
observed.
It is worth noting that stochastic processes
with additive-multiplicative structure (without mean re-
version) are being currently studied in connection with
a generalization of standard (Boltzmann-Gibbs) statisti-
cal mechanics, recently proposed by C. Tsallis [25]. The
PDFs associated to this new formalism generalize the ex-
1
ponential weights, namely, expq(
1−q
[entering as a factor in Eq. (19)]. The time series aris-
ing from additive-multiplicative processes without mean
reversion present strong correlations that prevent conver-
gence to either Gauss or L´evy limits[20] and lead to q-
Gaussian distributions. This suggests that similar corre-
lations may persist in mean-reverting processes with the
additive-multiplicative character. Once Eq. (10) leads
to PDFs in such a good agreement with empirical ones,
it is worth performing a detailed study and comparison
of real and artiﬁcial time series to test the models with
respect to the dynamics. Elucidating this point deserves
a careful separate treatment.

Publish or perish: analysis of scientiﬁc productivity using maximum entropy principle
and ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem

Using data retrieved from the INSPEC database we have quantitatively discussed a few syndromes
of the publish-or-perish phenomenon, including continuous growth of rate of scientiﬁc productivity,
and continuously decreasing percentage of those scientists who stay in science for a long time.
Making use of the maximum entropy principle and ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem, we have shown
that the observed fat-tailed distributions of the total number of papers x authored by scientists
may result from the density of states function g(x; τ ) underlying scientiﬁc community. Although
diﬀerent generations of scientists are characterized by diﬀerent productivity patterns, the function
g(x; τ ) is inherent to researchers of a given seniority τ , whereas the publish-or-perish phenomenon
is caused only by an external ﬁeld θ inﬂuencing researchers.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Nowadays, (. . . ) Evaluations of scientists depend on
number of papers, positions in lists of authors, and jour-
In Japan, Spain and elsewhere,
nals’ impact factors.
such assessments have reached formulaic precision. But
bureaucrats are not only wholly responsible for these
changes - we scientists have enthusiastically colluded.
What began as someone else’s measure has become our
(own) goal.(. . . ) [1]. In fact, a number of scientists all
over the world alter that research is in crisis. Academics
are having to publish-or-perish. Scientiﬁc articles become
a valuable commodity both for authors and publishers
[2]. The politics of publication does not only concen-
trate on publishing as valuable articles as possible. Of
course, since articles in leading journals certiﬁes one’s
membership in the scientiﬁc elite the impact factor of
journals matters but also the total number of publica-
tions is of great importance since frequent publications
allow to sustain one’s career, and are well seen when ap-
plying for funds. Authors have to plan when, how and
with whom to publish their results. Quoting Lawrence
[1]: The ideal time is when a piece of research is ﬁn-
ished and can carry a convincing message, but in reality
it is often submitted at the earliest possible moment.(. . . )
Findings are sliced as thin as salami and submitted to dif-
ferent journals to produce more papers. Scientists, who
are aware of the publish-or-perish phenomenon warn that
research professionalism may be sacriﬁced in the pursuit
of research grants and fame, or simply for fear of loss of
a position.

In this paper, using data retrieved from the INSPEC
database, we quantitatively analyze two syndromes of
the publish-or-perish phenomenon: continuous growth of
rate of scientiﬁc productivity and continuously decreas-
ing percentage of those scientists who stay in science for
a long time.

The paper is organized as follows. In the next section
we start with a simple examination of scientiﬁc produc-

tivity distributions for all INSPEC authors together, as
it was done by Lotka [3] and Shockley [4]. Then, we
study temporal evolution of the scientists. From the
whole database we draw long-life scientists, i.e.
scien-
tists who were doing research for at least 18 years. Hav-
ing such a set of scientists we divide it into the so-called
cohorts including those who started to publish in a given
year T (i.e. T = 1975, 1976,
. . . , 1987). We show
that unlike quickly increasing number of all authors listed
in the INSPEC database the number of long-life scien-
tists, as characterized by year of the ﬁrst publication T ,
remains almost constant indicating decreasing percent-
age of long-life scientists among all researchers. We also
show that histograms of scientiﬁc productivity N (x; t, T )
within T -cohorts, measured by the number of articles x,
change over time t from almost exponential (when cohort
contains young scientists) to clearly fat-tailed (when the
same cohort includes mature researchers). Additionally,
we observe that the number of articles produced by a rep-
resentative of each cohort increases with the square of se-
τ 2, indicating that each cohort
niority τ = t
i ∼
possesses ﬁxed acceleration parameter a(T ) = ∂2
/∂τ 2
x
i
h
which, on its own turn, quickly increases with T . Fi-
nally, in Sec. III, we analyze the observed distributions
of scientiﬁc productivity in terms of equilibrium statis-
tical physics. We show that the fat-tailed histograms
N (x; t, T ) may result from the inherent density of states
function g(x; τ ) characterizing scientiﬁc community. We
also introduce the parameter θ(t, T ), which has a similar
meaning as the inverse temperature β in the canonical
ensemble, and describes an external ﬁeld inﬂuencing sci-
entists. The parameter allow us to quantify the eﬀect of
publish-or-perish phenomenon.

FIG. 1: The ﬁgure explains the procedure used in order to
retrieve long-life scientists. We assume that an author belongs
to the T −cohort if the period of time that passed between
his/her ﬁrst and last publication fulﬁlls the relation Tf − T ≥
17, where Tf is the year of the last publication indexed in
our data set. According to the procedure only the ﬁrst two
authors, whose publication history is depicted in the ﬁgure,
are considered to be long-life T -scientists.

II. SCIENTIFIC PRODUCTIVITY -
FUNDAMENTAL RESULTS

In this study we report on scientiﬁc productivity of all
authors (over 3 million) listed in the INSPEC database
[5] in the period of 1969
2004. The database, pro-
−
duced by the Institution of Electrical Engineers, provides
a few million of records indexing scientiﬁc articles pub-
lished world-wide in physics, electrical engineering and
electronics, computing and information technology. Al-
though each INSPEC record contains a number of ﬁelds
(including publication title, classiﬁcation codes etc.) for
our purposes we have retrieved only two of them: au-
thors’ names (i.e. names with all initials) and publi-
cation year. Having the data we were able to discover
the initial year of one’s scientiﬁc activity T (i.e. year
of the ﬁrst publication) and also the cumulative number
of his/her publications in the next years. Additionally,
from the whole data set we have drawn long-life scien-
tists (i.e. scientists who were productive for at least 18
years, see Fig. 1), and we have divided them into the so-
called T
cohorts, with T having the same meaning as
−
previously.

A few important ﬁndings on evolution of scientiﬁc com-
munity can be immediately drawn from the simple com-
parison of the number of all T -authors and the number
of those authors who turned out to be long-life scientists.
However, before we discuss how the numbers and their
ratio depend on T , two limitations of our data should be
noted. First, since the INSPEC database does not con-
tain information about articles published before 1969, the
initial year of scientiﬁc activity T for scientists indexed
in the database in early seventies may be incorrect. That
is why, for further analysis we have restricted ourselves
to the period starting at T = 1975. Second, due to the
the criterion of 18 years of activity, taken when specify-
cohorts, the number of cohorts is limited to 13,

respectively for T = 1975, 1976, . . . , 1987. Keeping in
mind the mentioned constraints one can see (Fig. 2) that
although the number of all authors listed in the INSPEC
database increases every year, the number of long-life
scientists remains almost constant (the downward trend
observed in eighties should not be taken into account as
it may result from ﬁnite-size eﬀects due to reduction of
the period between T + 17 and 2004; consider the case of
the 2nd Author in Fig. 1). The chief conclusion result-
ing from the above observations is that the percentage
of long-life scientists among all scientists monotonically
decreases in time (see inset in Fig. 2).

In the rest of the section we will concentrate on the
fundamental features of distributions describing scien-
tiﬁc productivity of authors indexed in INSPEC. As a
matter of fact, scientiﬁc productivity, measured by the
number of papers authored, has a long history of study
in socio- and bibliometrics, with the articles by Lotka [3]
and Shockley [4] being famous early examples. Both of
these authors found that the number of papers produced
by scientists has a fat-tailed distribution, exhibiting both
a large number of authors who contributed only a few
articles, and a small number of authors who made a very
large number of contributions. Being more precise, Lotka
(1926) studied a sample of 6891 authors listed in Chem-
ical Abstracts during the period of 1907
1916 ﬁnding
that the number of authors making x publications was
described by a power law

FIG. 3: Histograms of the number of papers written by: all authors in INSPEC (solid squares) and long-life scientists in the
database (open squares). Solid lines represent ﬁts to the data as described in the text: log-normal distribution (gray line) with
m = 0.43 ± 0.01 and s = 1.69 ± 0.01, and distribution composed of two power laws (black lines) one for small and intermediate
events (γ = 1.67 ± 0.01) and the other for extreme events (γ = 2.87 ± 0.03).

thors listed in INSPEC and all long-life scientists in the
database. As expected, both distributions are highly
skewed, and their fat-tails are due to long-life scientists.
One can also see that the distribution of all authors re-
gardless of their seniority is well described by the log-
normal distribution (2), which for reasons elaborated by
Sornette and Cont [6] (see also [7, 8]) may be confused
with distribution having power law tail (1). In the Fig. 3,
apart of the log-normal ﬁt to our data, we have shown
that distribution composed of two power laws also ﬁts
our data very well. Nevertheless, the exponents γ for
both regions of the power law scaling signiﬁcantly diﬀer
from the exponent γ

2 predicted by Lotka.

≃

The reported studies show that scientists diﬀer enor-
mously in the number of papers they publish. Although,
at present the fat-tailed distributions are not so surpris-
ing for physicists as they were 20 years ago, the appear-
ance of highly skewed distributions characterizing scien-
tiﬁc productivity is still strange since it refers to scientiﬁc
elite who undergone a rigorous selection procedure and
is expected to be more homogeneous. At the moment,
one may for example suggest that the noticed diﬀerences
between scientists may result from the heterogeneity of
the analysed sample (e.g. as is the case in nonextensivity
driven by ﬂuctuations [9, 10]). To be ahead of these sug-
gestions, in the following we will concentrate on analysis
of T -cohorts, as they were characterized at the beginning
of this section. Although, the approach makes our data
more homogeneous, we are aware that it still does not
take into account other factors which inﬂuence scientiﬁc
productivity (e.g. access to resources which facilitate re-
search or geopolitical conditions). In the next section we
will try to convince the readership that the eﬀect of those
omitted factors may be understood in terms of a single
function having the same meaning as density of states in

equilibrium statistical physics.

−

Due to our approach, whatever diﬀerences are observed
among T
scientists they can be logically decomposed
into only two sorts: (i) life-course diﬀerences, which are
the eﬀects of biological and social aging, and (ii) cohort
diﬀerences, which are diﬀerences between cohorts at com-
parable points in career history. According to our knowl-
edge the only similar analysis of scientiﬁc productivity
was performed by Allison and Stewart [11], who anal-
ysed a sample of U.S. scientists in university departments
oﬀering advanced degrees in biology, chemistry, physics
and mathematics. The authors divided the sample into
8 age strata by the number of years since Ph.D., repre-
senting diﬀerent cohorts at diﬀerent points during their
career history. Unfortunately, lacking longitudinal data
the authors were only able to observe life-course diﬀer-
ences among scientists, assuming that cohort diﬀerences
are negligible.

clearly fat-tailed (when the same cohort consists of ma-
ture researchers). The results exemplify life-course diﬀer-
ences among long-life scientists, and in some sense con-
ﬁrm the so-called hypothesis of accumulative advantage
[11], which claims that due to a variety social and other
mechanisms productive scientists are likely to be even
more productive in the future, whereas those who pro-
duce little original work are likely to decline further in
their productivity.

At the moment, it is worth to mention that although
our analysis encompasses only 18 initial years of cohorts’
history, we have also veriﬁed the above relations for 28
years of activity of the oldest 1975-cohort, ﬁnding excel-
lent agreement with the results obtained for other cohorts
and for the shorter period of time (see insets in Fig. 5).
Nevertheless, one should be aware that even the most
productive scientists in his/her declining years slow down
pace of working. According to Zhao [12], the optimal age
for scientiﬁc productivity is between 25 and 45, reaching
the peak for researchers around 37 (i.e. about 18 years
since the beginning of the career). Similar ﬁndings has
been also reported by Kyvik [13], who found that pub-
49-year-old
lishing activity reaches a peak in the 45

−

age group and declines by about 30% among researchers
over 60 years old. Summing up, in the light of previ-
ous results on the relation between age and productivity,
ﬁndings reported in our paper apply to scientists in the
most proliﬁc period of their career.

Now, let us brieﬂy comment on the relations (3) and
(4). First, note that the linear dependence on seniority τ
in Eq. (4) implies that an average representative of each
cohort possesses an acceleration parameter a, which is
ﬁxed during the whole scientiﬁc career. Moreover, the
parameter increases with T (cf. Tab. I and Fig. 6), cer-
tifying that younger (in terms of T ) scientists are better
skilled to produce more papers than their older colleagues
at the same point of the scientiﬁc career. It is a matter
of debate whether the diﬀerences in a are due to better
adaptation of young people to technological achievements
(i.e. computers and the Internet), or they result from
the rough competition between researchers, and are one
of syndromes of the publish-or-perish phenomenon.
In
the next section, exploiting relations (3) and (4), we will
show that regardless of the reasoning the explanation of
accelerated productivity naturally emerges as a result of
treatment of the scientiﬁc community by means of meth-
ods borrowed from equilibrium statistical physics.

III. THEORETICAL APPROACH TO
SCIENTIFIC PRODUCTIVITY - DENSITY OF
STATES UNDERLYING SCIENTIFIC
COMMUNITY

In sociometrics, explanations of highly skewed his-
tograms of scientiﬁc productivity N (x) (see Fig. 3) are
generally of two (not necessarily exclusive) types [14].
The sacred spark (i.e. heterogeneity) hypothesis says that
the observed discrepancies in scientiﬁc productivity orig-
inate in substantial, predominated diﬀerences among sci-

entists in their ability and motivation to do creative re-
search, while the accumulative advantage (i.e. reinforce-
ment) hypothesis [11, 15] claims that due to a variety
of social and other mechanisms productive scientists are
likely to be even more productive in the future. Accord-
ing to the ﬁrst hypothesis, skewed distributions of hid-
den attributes characterizing scientists naturally lead to
skewed distribution of productivity, whereas the second
hypothesis argues that the observed fat-tailed histogram
N (x) results from sophisticated stochastic processes un-
derlying scientiﬁc productivity (see e.g. [4, 16]).

In this section we will present an alternative expla-
nation of the skewed productivity distributions. Since
we have already noticed that the fat-tail of the distri-
bution P (x) = N (x)/N characterizing the set of all au-
thors listed in INSPEC is due to long-life scientists (c.f.
Fig. 3), in the following we shall only concentrate on
distributions P (x; t, T ) = N (x; t, T )/N (T ) characterizing

−

T
cohorts (see Fig. 4). In order to describe the scientiﬁc
community, we will exploit the maximum entropy princi-
ple [17, 18], and we will adopt some of the fundamental
concepts from equilibrium statistical mechanics (like sta-
tistical ensemble, phase space, and density of states). We
will also argue, that our approach does not contradict the
sociological hypothesis mentioned at the beginning of the
section.

In physics, the notion of statistical ensemble means a
very large number of mental copies of the same system
taken all at once, each of which representing a possible
state that the real system might be in. When the en-
semble is properly chosen it should satisfy the ergodicity
condition, which guarantees that the average of a thermo-
dynamic quantity across the members of the ensemble is
the same as the time-average of the quantity for a single
system.

In our approach we will identify a representative of a
given T -cohort with a physical system, and we will try to
describe such a system (i.e. a long-life scientist) in terms
of statistical physics. Since (at least now) we do not have
access to parallel worlds, in our approach a large group of
copies of the same scientist will be replaced with a large
set of macroscopically similar long-life scientists, i.e. sci-
entists belonging to the same T -cohort, and taken at a
T . Here, the
given point in their scientiﬁc career τ = t
assumption of macroscopic similarity means that the con-
sidered scientists are exposed to the same external ﬁeld
(inﬂuence) θ(t, T ), which forces (motivates) scientists to
(t, T ). The

Of course, there exists a number of such parameters, in-
cluding: research ﬁeld, IQ level, age, number of cowork-
ers, motivation, funds etc., but as it turns out in the rest
of this section a few important ﬁndings about our ensem-
bles may be obtained even without detailed knowledge on
the parameters.) Due to the maximum entropy school of
statistical physics initiated by Edwin T. Jaynes in 1957
[17, 18], the best choice for the distribution P (Ω) is the
one that maximizes the Shannon entropy

that in a quasistatic process, due to suﬃciently slow dy-
namics, a system is considered to cross from one equilib-
rium state to another.) The assumption allow us to treat
cohort in separate years t > T as an equilib-
each T
rium system. The second comment relates to ergodicity
of our ensembles. In statistical physics the ergodic hy-
pothesis says that, over long periods of time, the time
spent in some region of the phase space corresponding to
microstates with the same energy is proportional to the
volume of this region, i.e. that all accessible microstates
Ω are equally probable over long period of time. Equiva-
lently, the hypothesis says that time average and average
over the statistical ensemble are the same. In the case of
long-life scientists, we may only speculate about the un-
derlying phase space, its dimensionality and coordinates
(5). Even if we were able to enumerate most of signiﬁcant
coordinates characterizing such scientists, surely a part
of these coordinates, including e.g. motivation, would be
impossible to quantify. Summarizing, given the above
and other diﬃculties it appears impossible to verify the
ergodic hypothesis for our ensembles, and the question -
if ergodicity is fulﬁlled here - remains open.

Now, having the theoretical framework we are in a po-
sition to analyze how the external ﬁeld θ(t, T ) inﬂuenc-
ing scientists depends on T , and how it changes over
time t. In order to calculate the parameter we use the
ﬂuctuation-dissipation relation

Before we proceed further, let us make two comments
here. First, since each T
cohort changes over time t a
sceptic may bring the validity of our equilibrium approach
into question. In order to justify the approach we assume
that time dependence of T -cohorts may be considered in
terms of quasistatic equilibrium process. (Let us remind

which may be simply derived from P (Ω) (11). (Keep in
mind that the ensemble averages
, and also
i
θ depend on both t and T .) At the moment, note that
in the previous section we have already found empirical
relations corresponding to both sides of the last formula.

T - cohort parameter

7

In order to ﬁnalize our theoretical approach to scien-
tiﬁc productivity we should explain the mutual relation-
ship between the theoretical distribution P (Ω) (11) and
the empirical distribution P (x; t, T ) (see Fig. 4). Thus,
since the two distributions apply to the same ensembles
there should exist a possibility to cross from one distri-
bution to the other. Such a possibility appears due to
the density of states function g(x; t, T ), which expresses
the number of allowed states Ω (cf. Eq. 5) that scientists
may be in, given that the number of publications corre-
sponding to these states equals x (6). Using the concept
of the density of states one can write

P (x(Ω); t, T ) = g(x; t, T )P (Ω),

and respectively the empirical function g(x; t, T ), correct
to the multiplicative factor Z(t, T ), may be obtained from
the below expression

where parameters a, b, A, B, C, D depend on T , whereas
E, τ1 are functions of these parameters (see Tab. I).

In Fig. 7 we have presented how the external ﬁeld
θ(t, T ) changes over seniority τ . Since the ﬁeld conjugates
to the cumulative number of publications, its decreasing
character indicates that small values of the ﬁeld corre-
spond to large productivity, and vice versa - large ﬁelds
induce small productivity. (The inverse of θ, i.e. κ = θ−1,
stands for a productivity ﬁeld which has more obvious so-
ciological interpretation: larger κ enforces larger number
of papers. See inset in Fig. 7.) Having in mind the reverse
relationship between θ and the number of publications x,
one can argue that the constant of integration D in (14)
must be equal to zero. The reasoning behind the state-
ment is the following. Given that the considered long-life
scientists never die, still being in the most proliﬁc period
of their career, one may simply imagine that in the limit
of τ
the total number of publications produced
by these scientists must approach inﬁnity, what corre-
sponds to θ(

, T ) = 0, and respectively D(T ) = 0.

The above results allow us to further investigate diﬀer-
ences between T -cohorts. Comparing values of the exter-
nal ﬁeld θ(t, T ) inﬂuencing T -scientists at the same point
τ = t
T in their scientiﬁc career, one can show that the
ﬁeld is a decreasing function of T (see Fig. 8). (We have
also checked that the decreasing character of θ(T + τ, T )
versus T holds for every value of τ = 1, 2, . . . , 18.) The
above stems from the fact that younger (in terms of T )
scientists publish more than their older colleagues at the
same age. The interesting point here is that statistical
physics allows to describe the phenomenon in terms of
changing external ﬁeld, which leads to accelerated pro-
ductivity as described in the previous section.

In Fig. 9 we have presented how the empirical den-
sity of states g(x; t, T ) depends on x. The most striking
feature about g(x; t, T ) is that it does not depend sepa-
rately on time t and T , but it depends on their diﬀerence

The above means that the density of states is an inherent
characteristic describing researchers of a given seniority
τ .
It also certiﬁes that the parameter θ(t, T ) (14) has
the meaning of an external ﬁeld, which is only respon-
sible for ﬁlling of corresponding states (5) in the hidden
phase space underlying scientiﬁc community. The anal-
ogy between our parameter θ and the inverse temperature
β in the canonical ensemble is indeed very close. Exter-
nal conditions expressed by the ﬁeld θ do not change
the considered system, which in our case corresponds to
a scientist characterized by a given value of τ . They
only inﬂuence the probability (11) of realization of a state
corresponding to a given productivity x (6). In partic-
ular, the ﬁndings allow us to say that representatives
of younger cohorts usually coauthor much more articles
than their counterparts (in terms of the same τ ) belong-
ing to older cohorts. It means that due to external re-
quirements (which we interpret as publish-or-perish phe-
nomenon) representatives of younger cohorts are skilled
(forced) to contribute more articles.

Finally, before we proceed to conclusions let us brieﬂy
comment on the shape of the function g(x; τ ) (see Fig. 9).
The function monotonically decreases for small and
quickly increases for large values of x, having the char-
acteristic minimum for intermediate x. One can argue
that the corresponding curvature of g(x; τ ) may result
from topological requirements imposed by the relation
x(Ω) (6) on the hidden space Ω =
(5).
A simple but still reasonable example of such a relation
is graphically presented in Fig. 10. (Although the ﬁgure

one can argue that it corresponds to the leading role of
one selected motivator yi, and insigniﬁcant role of other
parameters yj6=i. In some sense, such a naive thinking
on factors inﬂuencing scientists is consistent with a com-
mon experience stating that in early stages of career the
only one factor makes motivation for scientiﬁc activity
(e.g.
satisfaction). Along with growing x other moti-
vators start to play a role (e.g. recognition and being in
power), what may be expressed by the mentioned convex-
to-concave crossover.

FIG. 10: Examples of phase trajectories x(Ω) in the space
of scientiﬁc motivators Ω = {y1, y2, . . . , yn} resulting in the

IV. SUMMARY

presents only two- and three-dimensional phase spaces
the below reasoning also holds for higher dimensions.)
In the ﬁgure, the direction of the dashed lines expresses
growing number of publications x, whereas the area of
the n
dimensional hypersurface is proportional to the
number of states g(x; τ ) of a given value of x. As one can
see, the hypersurfaces x(Ω) corresponding to increasing
values of x change from convex to concave. The feature
leads to the minimum in the density of states function,
and has a nice sociological interpretation.

−

In order to outline the mentioned sociological interpre-
tation, let us assume that all motivators yi inﬂuencing
scientiﬁc productivity have some minimal values. Such
an assumption seems to bee natural since one can not
get salary lower than a certain limit, and it is impossible
to possess negative number of coworkers. On the other
hand, there are no upper limits for these parameters.
We are not even in a position to guess their units. It fol-
lows that for visualization purposes all motivators may
be limited to their positive values, as shown in Fig. 10.
Now, in order to justify the suggested convex character
of the hypersurface x(Ω) representing small values of x,

In this paper we have attempted to provide a quan-
titative approach to the publish-or-perish phenomenon,
which refers to the pressure to constantly publish work in
order to further or sustain one’s scientiﬁc career. Using
data retrieved from the INSPEC database we have quan-
titatively discussed a few syndromes of the phenomenon,
including continuous growth of rate of scientiﬁc produc-
tivity, and continuously decreasing percentage of those
scientists who stay in science for a long time. Methods
of equilibrium statistical physics have been applied for
the analysis. We have shown that the observed fat-tailed
distributions of the total number of papers x authored by
scientists may result from a speciﬁc shape of the density
of states function g(x; τ ) underlying scientiﬁc commu-
nity. We have also argued that although diﬀerent gen-
erations of scientists are characterized by diﬀerent pro-
ductivity patterns, the function g(x; τ ) is inherent to re-
searchers of a given seniority τ , and the publish-or-perish
phenomenon may be quantitatively characterized by the
only one time- and generation- dependent parameter θ,
which has the meaning of an external ﬁeld inﬂuencing
researchers.

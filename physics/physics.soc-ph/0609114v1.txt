Abstract

We study some statistical properties of the results of the Mexican elections of July 2nd, 2006.

Our studies only apply for the data of the program of preliminary electoral results. We show that

this program does not yield the results in a random way. Numbers that should be conserved are

studied statistically in detail. The distributions of the votes obtained by the diﬀerent parties are

obtained. Some distributions indicate small world while other can be ﬁtted by daisy models. We

also show that the election, as a measurement processes, has an error of ∼ 2%. Since the diﬀerence

between the two main candidates for president in this data-basis is of the order of ∼ 0.5% a winner

cannot be given.

In almost all the world, the democracy is a very important issue. It is also important how

the advent of new technologies is changing the way in which elections in democratic countries

are realized. On July 2nd, 2006, elections in Mexico were realized by the Mexican Federal

Institute of Elections (IFE by its spanish acronym). That institute has one of the most

advanced electoral systems. In fact, the IFE yields technical support to several emerging

electoral systems in the world like Iraq and Haiti. In the last Mexican elections of July 2nd, a

very atypical election happened. In the opinion polls realized few weeks before the election,

two of the candidates for president were almost in tie. This situation becomes a novelty

since it is the ﬁrst time that the IFE need to resolve a presidential election considered a tie.

As any measurement process the fact that several errors are associated to the election, this

situation makes diﬃcult to decide a winner [1, 2].

In this work we analyze one of the systems implemented by the IFE say, the program of

preliminary electoral results or PREP by its acronym in spanish [3]. It is supposed that this

program yields in less than 3 days a very accurate result of the elections. The PREP works

with certiﬁcates that come stamped over the packets of ballots.

In those certiﬁcates the

authorities of each electoral cabin write the number of votes for each party, total number of

votes, etc. at the end of the election. Then the authorities of each electoral cabin deliver

the ballots and certiﬁcates to the capture centers.

In the next section we will show the time behavior of the results that the PREP yield and

we analyze the reliability of the system. Using some simple conservation laws, in Section II,

we made the error analysis of the data in the PREP ﬁle. In Section III we show and analyze

the distributions of votes that for the elections of deputies, senators and president. A brief

conclusion, about the error of the election by using the results of the PREP follows.

I. TIME BEHAVIOR OF THE PREP

Around 20:00 hrs of July 2nd, the program of preliminary electoral results (PREP) of

IFE [3] started to display and update results each 5 minutes. At the beginning, the PREP
yielded a very big diﬀerence (∼ 7%) in favor of the candidate Felipe Calder´on of the right

party (PAN by its spanish acronym [4]). But all citizens, including scientist, were waiting

a very close election due to the results of the opinion polls. The tendency showed a de-

crease in the votes of the right party PAN and an increase in the votes of the other main

candidate, Andr´es Manuel L´opez Obrador of a coalition of left parties (PBT[4]). In a ﬁrst

sight, a crossing between the votes obtained by the two candidates was eminent. For that

reason, several scientist started to capture the real time results with diﬀerent methods, some

captured by hand, other captured automatically with programs like perl [5].

In Fig. 1 we show the plot of the real time data given the PREP for the three main

candidates. This plot shows roughly two tendencies for the votes obtained by the candidate

of the left party. The increasing tendency changed to a decreasing tendency around 3:OO

AM of 3rd July. Probably the same time in which the rural vote started to arrive to the

capture centers. At the same point, Roberto Madrazo of the coalition ABM [4] started to

gain votes, since one of the parties of this coalition, the PRI, has strong inﬂuence on rural

areas.

Then, no crossing between the vote percentage of the two candidates was found with the

PREP in real time . Nevertheless one should notice that the real-time PREP started to

display results with around 8% of the certiﬁcates processed. Although, one may think on

mistrusts due to that plot, one should be careful since the PREP gives results that depend

on a part of the voting which does not represent a statistical sample taken from a uniform

random distribution[6, 7]. This means that, assuming a clean election, the data arrived to

the capture centers from sites with better transport networks and/or a better vote counting

performance.

In Fig. 2 we plot the data of the PREP as ordered in their ﬁnal form, by

alphabetical order of the state name. As seen, the tendency of each state of Mexico is

4

reﬂected in this plot. Henceforth a clear correlation between the percentage of votes and

the way we sort the vote certiﬁcates is clear. In order to broke such a correlation we sorted

the certiﬁcates in a random way yielding a fast convergence to their ﬁnal values, except for

small ﬂuctuations. In ﬁgure 3(a) and (b) we show two realization of such a shuﬄed process,

one ( 3(a)) with the right candidate winning at the beginning and the another ( 3(b) with

an initial advantage of the left party. Since it is not a unique way to order the sample, it is

possible to sort the data in a way that any of the three main candidates has an advantage

for small processed votes. In 3(c) we select all the certiﬁcates where the PRI candidate won

and we putted them at the beginning or the ﬁnal PREP ﬁle. Clearly this candidate remains

the advantage for around the 11% and then start to lost it. In 3(d) we show the result of

consider at the end of the counting process (for a random shuﬄe) all the cabins where the
leftist candidate AMLO won (∼ 40%). Note that the percentage of votes in cabins where

he did not win is smaller than those to RMP-PRI.

The percentage of votes as a function of the number of records for the small parties are

plotted in Fig. 4. As can be seen, the number of annulled votes is more than twice the

diﬀerence between the two candidates with more votes. This is a ﬁrst indication that the

election yields a tie. The number of annulled votes can come from citizens who want to

annulate their vote or from real errors from voters. Another interesting conclusion of this

ﬁgure is that the number of votes for the non-registered candidates is very large. This means

that one of the independent candidates probably obtained one or more places in the chamber

since, in the Mexican laws, there are deputies proportional to the number of votes obtained.

Since the names of the non-registered candidates are written by hand in the ballots, there

is no other option that read and count all ballots with non-registered candidates. From

Figs. 2 and 4 one can see directly that there are strong correlations between the parties

that obtained large and small number of votes. It probably means that the voters can be

represented by two parties at the same time. It also means that the small parties generate a

distraction for the voters. This distraction becomes important in very close elections. The

percentage of votes for the senators and deputies show a similar behavior to that of the

president candidates with the only exception of the Nueva Alianza party. It shows a number

of votes approximately 4 times larger for the chambers positions than those for president.

II. CONSERVATION LAWS IN ELECTIONS

In the cabin certiﬁcates became written several data: Total number of received ballots

at the electoral process beginning (Br). Number of remaining (not used) ballots (Bs).

Number of voters (V ). Number of deposited ballots in each cabin (Bd). And the number

of votes for each party/candidate (Vi, i = PAN, PRI, PRD, Nueva Alianza,Alternativa,

non-registered candidates and annulled votes). Based on this information, there are some

conservation laws that can be checked in the election. For instance, one can check the lost

or appearance of ballots. In particular we can study the total number of ballots minus the
number of remaining ballots minus the number of voters per cabin,i.e., Br − (Bs + V ). In

principle this number should be zero but, as seen in Fig. 5, the distribution of this quantity

7

is peaked around zero but is not the expected δ(x). Data in the positive axis mean lost

ballots. Data in the negative axis indicate appearance of ballots. Zooms in diﬀerent parts of

this distribution show the following facts. (1) The PREP conservates this number for only
∼ 45% of the cabins. This result is very unfortunate for IFE since it says that the PREP is

reliable only less than 50%. (2) The distribution is not completely symmetric. In particular
the peak around −250 is higher than the peak at 250.

(3) There are inconsistencies of

more than 150 votes in several cabins. Those results are non-sense. (4) There are peaks in
±10, ±20, . . . and also in ±100, ±200, . . .. Those peaks are related with capture typos. (5)

The left peak of the distribution shows a diﬀerent behavior for senators than deputies and

president. This result cannot be understood statistically since all certiﬁcates (for president,

senators and deputies) should be very similar to each other since are captured in the same

way. This means that the capture of the data was diﬀerent for three similar processes. (6)

The distribution between 10 and 150 decays as a power law.

Apart from capture errors and annulled votes, other sources of errors exist. One is related
to the persons who could not vote. A conservative estimation yields more than 2.5 × 105

voters. This estimation was made considering the special electoral cabins for citizens that are

far from their designated electoral cabin. This number is similar to the diﬀerence between

the votes obtained by the two main candidates in this election. Also, since in some states

of Mexico two elections take place at the same time, errors can occur when people take less

ballots, i.e., the ballots for the local election only. The opposite is also possible. Although

there are errors in the counting by humans, they are diminished since several persons count

the ballots several times. Up to our knowledge, the evaluation of this error has not been

realized. One should notice that errors can yield also extra votes to the diﬀerent candidates.

Finally, other errors (random or systematic) are not taken into account.

In Figs. 6 and 7 we test other conservation laws, by ploting the distributions of diﬀerence

between the total ballots received Br minus the sum of the ballots remained Bs plus the

ballots deposited in urns Bd by cabin, and the diﬀerence between the total ballots received

Br minus the sum of the ballots remained Bs plus the sum of votes obtained by each

political party, included null votes Pi Vi; respectively. Those distributions should give also

a δ function in the ideal case. But, as seen, one is very asymmetric. In the insets we show

that typos are also present and that power laws appear.

FIG. 5: Probability distribution of the diﬀerence between the total ballots received Br minus the

sum of the ballots remained Bs and the total number of voters V by cabin. The negative values in

the horizontal axis means more votes than ballots and positive values means lost of ballots, but in

both cases there are no conservation of the the total number of ballots received Br in each cabin.

The inset shows the left branch of the distribution in log-log scale. This shows a decay as a power

law. Notice the several sharp peaks of the distribution along the horizontal axis between the values

10 to 100. These peaks show the capture mistakes made by humans. We noticed also that the

probability distributions of the senators show a strange behavior related with the corresponding

probability distributions for president and deputies in the left branch.

III. DISTRIBUTIONS OF THE VOTES

The histograms of the number of electoral cabins that have a certain number of votes

is given in Fig. 8 (a). As seen the histogram for the votes of Roberto Madrazo varies very

slowly (in Fig. 9 appears a ﬁtting and below their explanation). The tail of this distribution

looks exponential. Probably the form of this distribution represents the corporative vote.

FIG. 6: Probability distribution of the diﬀerence between the total ballots received Br minus the

asymmetry between the both branches for the three distributions is similar, but it is diﬀerent from

peaks associated to capture mistakes. The inset shows both branches of the distributions in log-log

This is not the case for the distributions of the two main candidates. The distribution of

the votes for Felipe Calder´on shows a very diﬀerent behavior for electoral cabins with less
than ≈ 40 votes since it starts ﬂat. The distribution of Andr´es Manuel L´opez Obrador is

also very strange. It shows three diﬀerent regimes. It appears like a distribution in which

realizations between 60 and 300 votes are missing. This can be due to two reasons, the ﬁrst

one is that the data were manipulated, the second implies that the distribution of the votes

for Andr´es Manuel L´opez Obrador is composed by two or more distributions [8]. This is in

great contrast with the distributions of the votes for Felipe Calder´on and Roberto Madrazo

which vary very slowly in the same interval of votes. The distributions for the senators and

deputies present similar behavior as seen in Fig. 8 (b) and (c).

The histograms for the parties with small number of votes are given in Fig. 8 (d). As seen,

all histograms have a similar behavior between them, except at small number of votes. All

them are shifted power-laws, except for Roberto Campa. Those results can be explained with

several models [10] on cluster growth in complex networks, for instance, and appear in other

electoral processes [9]. A research on this lines is in progress [11]. We found an inconsistency

in the tail of the annulled votes. This distribution shows several electoral cabins with more

that 100 annulled votes. The probability of having such results is negligible. Then those

results are not statistical.

As a ﬁnal remark, we return to the RMP-PRI case. The distribution of votes for this

party is clearly of a statistical nature and it is tempting to propose an analytical ﬁt. However

the lack of a straight way to obtain their natural average density makes diﬃcult to do the

usual unfolding to obtain the normalized sequence, both in its area and in its average, in

order to analyze the ﬂuctuation properties. As an anzatz, we select one realization of the

randomly shuﬄed sequence and generate a cumulative votes density. We then adjust a 4th

degree polynomial on windows of 300 and 3000 cabin certiﬁcates obtaining a reliable average

density of events for the RMP-PRI votes counting. In both cases the results were similar.

On this unfolded sequence of votes we calculate their nearest neighbor distribution. A larger

and cautious analysis of the distribution is in progress but this result have a good agreement

where n corresponds to the nth neighbor spacing distribution and r to the kind or rank of

the daisy family. This model is the result of removing every (r + 1)th level from a random

sequence. In Fig. 9 we present the daisy model of rank 2 and 3 for the nearest neighbor

case(n = 1) and their comparison with the unfolded PRI distribution. The former daisy

model adjust the tail and the later the central part. Since we broke correlations larger than

the mean value we can expect that only the statistics around the mean is correct. Note that

no ﬁtting parameter was used, in contrast to consider a Brody function. One should remark

that the daisy models are derived of a single poissonian distribution.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

To conclude, we have studied the statistical properties of the Mexican elections from the

program of preliminary electoral results. We have shown that the appearence of the data

in time are not statistical. Evidence of correlations between parties with large number of

votes and small number of votes are evident. There is also evidence of correlation with the

annuled votes. Quantities that shold be conserved where studied. Typos in capture of the

data are evident. We also have obtained the distributions of votes of the diﬀerent parties.

In particular the distribution of the party that was in power in Mexico during more than

70 years behaves smothly. Daisy models of 2nd and 3rd rank seem to ﬁt diﬀerent parts

of the measured distribution. In contrast the distributions of the parties with more votes

are atypical while the distributions of small parties follow power laws. This is an evidence

of small world processes. A heuristic evaluation of the error supports that it is around

8 times larger than the diﬀerence between the two main candidates. The sentence, “in a

democracy, the winner of the election can be decided just by one vote” is not valid. The

diﬀerence between the ﬁrst and second place should be larger than the error associated to

the mesurement, in this case the electoral processes. The second round in very close elections

is probably needed.

Volatility and dividend risk in perpetual American options

(Dated: September 27, 2013)

American options are ﬁnancial instruments that can be exercised at any time before expiration.
In this paper we study the problem of pricing this kind of derivatives within a framework in which
some of the properties of the underlaying stock —volatility and dividend policy— can change at
a random instant of time, but in such a way that we can forecast the ﬁnal conditions. These
peculiar assumptions can still model some actual market conditions: a relevant fact may have sharp
predictable consequences and still remain uncertain whether the ﬁrm will be eventually aﬀected.
We will show the eﬀects of this potential risk on perpetual American derivatives, a topic connected
with a wide class of recurrent problems in physics: holders of American options must look for the
fair price and the optimal exercise strategy at once, a typical question of free absorbing boundaries.
We present explicit solutions to the most common contract speciﬁcations and derive analytical
expressions concerning the mean and higher moments of the exercise time.

INTRODUCTION

Pricing ﬁnancial derivatives is a main subject in math-
In
ematical ﬁnance with clear implications in physics.
1900, ﬁve years before Einstein’s classic paper, Bache-
lier [1] proposed the arithmetic Brownian motion for the
dynamical evolution of stock prices. Among his aims was
the obtaining of a formula for option valuation. Samuel-
son noticed the structural failure of the Bachelier’s mar-
ket model: it allowed negative values for the stock price,
what led to undesired consequences in option prices. For
correcting these unwanted features, he introduced the ge-
ometric Brownian motion [2]. Within this log-normal
model, Samuelson obtained the fair price for perpetual
options but nevertheless he was unable to ﬁnd a general
solution. The answer of this open question must wait un-
til the publication of the works of Black and Scholes [3],
and Merton [4]. The celebrated Black-Scholes formula
has been broadly used by practitioners since then, mainly
due to its unambiguous interpretation and mathematical
simplicity.

It is well established, however, that this model fails
to ﬁt some features of actual derivatives. In particular,
there is solid evidence pointing to the necessity of relax-
ing the assumption, present in the Black-Scholes model,
that a constant volatility parameter drives the stock
price. Many models have been developed with the pur-
pose of avoiding this restrictive condition: in Merton [5]
volatility was a deterministic function of time, in Cox and
Ross [6] was stock-dependent, Hull and White [7] pro-
posed a model where the squared volatility also follows
a log-normal diﬀusion equation, Wiggins [8] considered
underlying and volatility as a two-dimensional system of
correlated log-normal random processes, in Scott [9], and

∗Electronic address: miquel.montero@ub.edu

also in Stein and Stein [10], the instantaneous volatility
follows a mean-reverting arithmetic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
process, and Heston [11] introduced correlation in the
preceding model, just to name a few.

Another standard limitation of the Black-Scholes for-
mula is that it is restricted to European derivatives: the
option can only be exercised at maturity, at the end of its
life. However, the majority of exchange-traded options
are American: they can be exercised anytime during the
life of the contract. Once again there is a clear connection
with typical problems in physics: the earliest analysis of
the issue of pricing American derivatives was formulated
by McKean [12] as a free boundary problem for the heat
equation. Kim [13] provided an integral representation
of the option price but, unfortunately, we have nowadays
no explicit expression for the American counterpart of
the Black-Scholes formula. The kernel of the problem
is that, in general, the optimal exercise boundary is im-
plicitly deﬁned by the integral equation that determines
the price of the option. Only under certain circumstances
closed expressions for the American options do exist: e.g.
in the case in which the properties of the derivative lead
to a constant early exercise price, as in Rubinstein and
Reiner [14], or when the option is perpetual, has no ma-
turity, as in Kim [13], and also in Elliott and Chan [15],
where the stock is driven by fractional Brownian motion.
In the most general scenario analytical or numerical ap-
proximate methods must be used instead —see, for in-
stance, Broadie and Detemple [16], Ju [17], Broadie et
al [18], and references therein as well.

In this article we will generalize a market model ﬁrst
introduced by Herzel [19] as a simpliﬁed version of Naik’s
work. Naik [20] developed a model in which the volatility
can take only two known values, and the market switches
back and forth between them, in a random way. Herzel
let the volatility jump at most once: a suitable way for
encoding a market that may undergo a severe change
in volatility only if some forthcoming event takes place.

Herzel formally solved the problem of pricing European
options if the market price of volatility risk was constant.
The problem was revisited in Ref. [21], where diﬀerent
risk premiums were considered and some explicit solu-
tions were found. Here we will tackle the problem of
pricing perpetual American options within a framework
where volatility but also dividend rate may perform a
single transition at some instant in the future.

The paper is structured as follows:

In Sect. II we
present the market model and its general properties. In
Sect. III we introduce the concept of ﬁnancial derivative,
and explore the links between ﬁnance and physics in the
context of American derivatives. Section IV is devoted
to the subject of pricing perpetual American options: we
stress the ﬁnancial interest of these ideal derivatives and
emphasize the potentials of the analytical expressions
found.
In Sect. V we show some illustrative examples
and discuss their implications. The paper ends with the
conclusions which are drawn in Sect. VI.

II. THE MARKET MODEL

Let us begin with the general description of our set-
up. We will consider a ﬁnancial market where the non-
deterministic stock S is traded. The evolution of the
price of this stock, assuming that S = S(t0) at t = t0, is
the following:

S(t) = S(t0)+

µ(t′)S(t′)dt′ +

σ(t′)S(t′)dW (t′

t0),

−

t

t0

Z

t

t0

Z

where W (t) is a Wiener process, a one dimensional Brow-
nian motion with zero mean and variance equal to t. The
drift, µ, and the volatility, σ, are stochastic quantities
which have initially some given values, µa and σa. After
that they may change simultaneously to diﬀerent ﬁxed
values, µb and σb. Such a transition can take place only
once in a lifetime:

µ(t) = µa1t≤τ + µb1t>τ ,

σ(t) = σa1t≤τ + σb1t>τ .

Throughout the text 1
{·} will denote the indicator func-
tion, which assigns the value 1 to a true statement, and
= σb,
the value 0 to a false statement. Note that if σa
we will have a market model with stochastic volatility.
The case in which µa
= µb has in principle a more ﬂex-
ible interpretation, although we will concentrate our at-
tention in the existence of two diﬀerent dividend pay-oﬀ
regimes. These magnitudes are stochastic because the
instant τ > t0 in which the transition occurs is a random
variable. We will assume that it follows an exponential
law:

time t.

(t0)] = λ−1. In the previous expressions and
(t) represents all the available information at

The asset behaviour may be easily visualized when we
express it in terms of returns, R(t; t0)
log(S(t)/S(t0)),
instead of spot prices. The return will follow a drifted
Wiener process with parameters (µa, σa) up to time τ .
After that time this initial Brownian motion freezes and
a second drifted Wiener process drives the subsequent
evolution of the return:

≡

R(t; t0) = Ra(min(t, τ ); t0) + Rb(max(t, τ ); τ ),

−

with Ra,b(t; t′) = σa,bWa,b(t
t′). Here we
−
have deﬁned constants θa and θb for the sake of simplicity
of future expressions, θa,b = µa,b

In the most common situation only the stock or its
derivatives, securities whose price depends upon the
value of this underlying, will be aﬀected by the actual
value of τ . In this case, in which the risk associated with
τ cannot directly negotiated, the market is not complete,
in the sense that we will not able to reproduce the be-
haviour of options or any other derivative by means of a
portfolio that solely counts with traded assets, like shares
and bonds. Therefore, if we want to completely cover our
market exposure to volatility or dividend risk we must
also include in our portfolio a secondary option, another
derivative with the same underlying stock but diﬀerent
contract speciﬁcations. The immediate consequence of
an incomplete market is that the risk premium coming
from τ is arbitrary to a certain extent. From a practical
point of view this means that we could replace λ with
another constant (or even with a whole function of the
underlying) at our will. In this situation investors can
freely evaluate the likelihood of a change in the market
properties on the basis of their own perceptions.

We will avoid however entering into this discussion by
keeping λ unchanged, mainly for two reasons. On the
one hand, we guarantee in this way the absence of the
so-called statistical arbitrage, i.e. that the expected value
of a null portfolio remains always equal to zero. There-
fore nobody can expect to obtain proﬁt without expo-
sure of capital [23]. On the other hand, we do not need
to introduce a risk-neutral measure for τ when valuating
derivatives: we can directly use the market measure de-
rived from Eq. (1). In order to extent these features to
the probability spaces where the Brownian motions are
deﬁned, we will set µa,b = r
δa,b, where r is the risk-free
−
interest rate, and δa,b represents the (continuous in time)
dividend pay-oﬀ before and after instant τ .

Options are contracts between two parties, sold by one
party to another, that give the buyer the right, but not
the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) shares of the un-
derlying stock at some prearranged price within a certain

period or on a speciﬁc date, the maturity or expiration
time. The strike or agreed price may be a ﬁxed quantity
K, but it can be an intricate function of the stock value
as well, as in the case of Asian options:

K =

S(t′)dt′,

or it may also involve new parameters, as in the case of
binary options:

−

K = S(t)

(2)
−
We will encode all of them under the generic sign K. As
a consequence of their privileged position, option holders
will only exercise their rights if they obtain a net beneﬁt.
Therefore we can see options as contingent claims with
their present value determined by the discounted value
of the expected proﬁt:

P (t0, S(t0); K) = E[X(S(t∗); K)e−r(t∗−t0)

(t0)],

|F

where X(S; K) is the pay-oﬀ function —e.g. in the case
of a single constant parameter K we may have for calls
(+) and puts (-) that X ±(S; K) = max(
K), 0)—
and t∗ is the actual exercise time.

(S

−

±

When the option can be exercised at the end of the
contract lifetime T only, the exercise time is determin-
istic. This kind of derivatives are said to be European.
The American options instead are derivatives that can be
exercised at any time before expiration, and therefore t∗
is in this case an stochastic magnitude as well. Note that
the contract becomes worthless if it is exercised but also
after maturity T . The option buyer must decide under
which conditions the option can be optimally exercised,
and the decision will ﬁnally depend on the present value
of stock price S. The problem is thus in essence a typ-
ical problem of ﬁrst-passage time: we must determine
at what time the process S will touch the boundary H.
In ﬁnancial language, H is named the optimal exercise
boundary, the stock price above (below) which it is better
to exercise the call (put) than to keep the option alive.
In the most general case, this boundary will be mobile,
i.e. a function of time, H(t). Therefore, we will deﬁne
the exercise time t±(t0) as the ﬁrst time the underly-
ing crosses the threshold given that at present time, t0,
the spot price of the asset lies in the proper side of the
boundary:

t±(t0) = min

S(t0) ≶ H(t0)
t > t0; S(t) R H(t)
|

. (3)

(cid:8)

The optimal strategy for choosing the boundary func-
tion derives from the following constrain: the investor
must settle H(t) in such a way that the value of a alive
option equals the pay-oﬀ of the contingent claim in the
optimal exercise price,

(cid:9)

P ±(t, S = H; K) = X ±(H; K).

The condition must be fulﬁlled in a smooth way as well,

in the case that the right-hand side of the last expression
exists. That is, the option price must be continuous with
continuous derivative in the asset price when it crosses
the boundary. In conclusion, the investor must compute
function H(t) at the same time he or she evaluates the
option price.

We must point out that the complexity of this kind
of problems can be increased without limits. In partic-
ular, the pay-oﬀ of the option may depend on whether
or not the underlying asset has reached or exceeded a
predetermined price. Thus, the holder of a call (put)
will have the right of buy (sell) the asset at price K,
only if the stock quotes over (under) a certain limit K0,
as in the case of binary options –see above. This class
of derivatives are known as barrier options, and among
them we will ﬁnd, for instance, gap options, in which
K and K0 have two diﬀerent constant values. This will
modify the ﬁrst-passage problem by introducing a second
(ﬁxed) boundary:

t±(t0) = min

t > t0; S(t) R H(t) R K0|
(cid:9)
(cid:8)
Obviously, other scenarios are also feasible, for instance
we may have:

S(t0) ≶ H(t0)

.

t±(t0) =

min

S(t0) ≶ H(t0) ≶ K0
t > t0; K0 R S(t) R H(t)
|

,

(cid:8)

where the maximum pay-oﬀ of the option is limited by
K0. We will not consider however knock-out options, a
contract with a built-in condition that makes that the
option expires worthless if the barrier is surpassed at any
moment in the option lifetime:

(cid:9)

t±(t0) =
,

S(t0) ≶ H(t0)
t)
|

≤

min

t > t0; S(t) R H(t), K0 R S(t′

(cid:8)

(cid:9)
because the pay-oﬀ depends on the whole history of the
stock. The same feature appears when dealing with
other exotic options, like Asian options or Lookback op-
tions. We will concentrate our attention on those cases
for which the pay-oﬀ is a function of the current value of
the asset only.

IV. PERPETUAL AMERICAN OPTIONS

We analyse now the problem of valuating perpetual
American options within the previous set-up. It can be
objected that perpetual American options have a limited
practical interest since, in general, actual derivatives ex-
pire. In this sense, one can argue that they represent the
limiting value of a far from maturity contract, and there-
fore they may help in the pricing process if the theoretical
price cannot be computed. On the other hand, the exis-
tence of a expiration time is a feature which is not shared
by systems coming from other branches of science. The
results introduced in this section may be thus of interest
in diﬀerent ﬁelds. We will stress this interpretation later.

The major simpliﬁcation that introduces perpetual
American options is that the value of the boundary must
be constant, H = H0, given that the problem is station-
ary. And, since the process S(t) is continuous, we will
have:

P ±(t0, S0; K) = E[X ±(S(t); K)e−r(t±
= X ±(H0; K)E[e−r(t±

with t±

note that the magnitude we must compute for obtaining
the price of the option, E[e−r(t±
(t0)], is nothing
but a typical moment-generating function of the ﬁrst-
passage time interval (t±

In order to conserve this extra functionality in the out-
put of the problem under analysis, we will formally keep
µa and µb (and consequently also θa and θb) as indepen-
dent parameters, in spite of the fact that if we want to
recover the risk neutral measure, and therefore the right
ﬁnancial result, we should set µa,b = r
δa,b. Hence,
in essence, our task reduces to obtaining the probability
density function of the exercise time:

A. The constant case

Let us ﬁrstly consider the case in which volatility and
drift are constant. For µ = µa and σ = σa the probability
density function for the ﬁrst time the process crosses H0
can be obtained by invoking the reﬂection principle of
the Brownian motion:

ψ±

,

p
where x0 = log(H0/S0). Obviously, a similar expression
holds for the density ψ±
b (t; t0, S0, H0), which corresponds
to µ = µb and σ = σb. The outcome of the expectation we
are computing when the both values, drift and volatility,
are constant and equal to µa and σa is well known —see
for instance Ref. [22]:

E[e−r(t±

Here, by Ea[
(t0)] we want to refer to the use of
ψ±
a (t; t0, S0, H0) instead of ψ±(t; t0, S0, H0) in the com-
putation of expected values. We have also introduced
constant β±

which diﬀerentiates the overall properties of calls and

must ﬁnally recover for the limiting case λ
0. When
a will be replaced with β±
b ,
we have λ
which is deﬁned accordingly. One of the most typical
pay-oﬀ functions, as we have pointed out above, is the
following: X ±(S; K) = max(
K), 0), which leads
to the American version of the plain vanilla call or put:

a/2, the

value of H0 diverges: there is no optimal boundary, the
option is never exercised and, as a consequence, it must
quote as its underlying stock, V +
a (t, S(t)) = S(t). Thus,
if the volatility is constant and the stock pays no divi-
dend, only American puts are meaningful. For them we
will have β−

Another typical pay-oﬀ is

lead to H0 = K0, an therefore:

(cid:18)

Here there is no ﬁnancial reason for holding the option
unexercised once we are in the bonus region. In fact, we
can take the price of a binary option as the basic building
block in the search for new solutions since:

P ±(t0, S0; K) = X ±(H0; K)D±(t0, S0; H0).

B. The general case

We will now return to the most general case:

P ±(t0, S0; K) = X ±(H0; K)E[e−r(t±

(t0)],

|F

with the previous results in mind. We can split the ex-
pression under the expectation sign into two terms, the
ﬁrst one counting only the realizations of the process that
reach exercise price before the change in the dynamics,
and the second one collects those for which the optimal
boundary is hit after the transition:

The computation of the second term in Eq. (8) is cum-

We have seen above how an American call option is
never exercised if the volatility remains constant and the
share pays no dividend. This conclusion is still valid al-
though σa
= σb. Recall that δa,b = 0 if and only if
β+
a,b = 1. But this condition leads to ℓ+ = 0, and con-
sequently, H0 tends to inﬁnity and V + = S. Therefore,
the stock must pay dividends before the change, after the
change, or in both periods, in order to diﬀer options from
their underlying. Thus, in the case in which only δa is
diﬀerent from zero, H0 takes the simpler form:

H0 =

V. SOME EXAMPLES AND APPLICATIONS

In this section we present some practical examples that
may illustrate the consequences of volatility and dividend
risk in the properties of perpetual American options. We
will consider in the ﬁrst place the pay-oﬀ of vanilla op-
tions, X ±(S; K) = max(
K), 0), and analyse the
(S
outcomes related to the price itself.

±

Thus, in Fig. 1 we can see the eﬀect of a change in the
dividend policy on call prices. To be more speciﬁc, in
Fig. 1.a we consider that the quoted ﬁrm may suddenly
stop the dividend payment to the shareholders. The con-
sequence is that the value of the option increases due to
the possibility of a stoppage in the distribution of div-
idends. The optimal exercise price also increases with
respect to the undisturbed one: note that λ = 0 repre-
sents the limit situation in which the change is impos-
sible. Fig. 1.b shows the opposite scenario. Here the
consequences are somewhat more dramatic. Remember
that if the stock pays no dividend, there is no optimal ex-
ercise price, and therefore any American call option must
quote as its underlying.

6
case, we can check in the insets that all plots in Fig. 1.b,
as well as in Fig. 1.a, converge to the pay-oﬀ function for
large values of the moneyness.

FIG. 1: (Color online) Option prices for a perpetual vanilla
call under dividend risk. We represent the price of the option,
in terms of the moneyness (S0/K), for diﬀerent values of λ. In
(a) we explore the consequences of an abrupt stoppage in the
dividend payment. We have used typical market values for the
parameters: r = 3.5%, δa = 2%, δb = 0% and σa = σb = 10%.
In (b) we consider a role reversal in which the stock may
suddenly start paying dividends: δa = 0% and δb = 2%. In
both cases we plot the pay-oﬀ function in a solid (black) line.

K

Thus, if λ = 0 (not represented in Fig. 1.b) we must
have V + = S. For small enough values of λ, the price de-
parts very little from this regime for small values of the
moneyness, S0/K, but attains gently the pay-oﬀ limit
when the moneyness increases. This picture changes
abruptly for larger values of λ, where the option price
may apparently cross downward the pay-oﬀ barrier with-
out being exercised. Obviously in real markets no op-
tion would be traded under these circumstances, because
the buyer will obtain a risk-less instantaneous proﬁt of
V + > 0 by exercising the option just after
S0 −
the purchase. The obvious conclusion is that the op-
tion holder must consider Eq. (13) as the optimal exer-
cise boundary whenever the option price is equal to or
greater than the pay-oﬀ, but he or she must exercise it
if this limit is surpassed [24]. The origin of the reported
behaviour is in the fact that for this example ℓ+ < 0.
When this condition is fulﬁlled, Eq. (12) changes its na-
ture from some sort of weighted mean of option prices
to a competition between the two terms. If the second
one is the leading term we can get this kind of improper
= 0 it is not a valid price at all. In any

FIG. 2: (Color online) Option prices for a perpetual vanilla
put under volatility risk. We represent the price of the option,
in terms of the moneyness (S0/K), for diﬀerent values of λ.
In (a) we analyse the consequences of an sudden increment in
the volatility of the stock. We have used the following values
for the parameters: r = 3.5%, δa = δb = 0.5%, σa = 10%
and σb = 20%. In (b) the present value of the volatility of
the stock is higher, σa = 20%, and it may undergo a severe
reduction in its value σb = 10%. In both cases we plot the
pay-oﬀ function in a solid (black) line.

The following example deals with the eﬀect of a change
in the volatility on put prices. In Fig. 2.a we can see how
the price of the put steadily increases with the likelihood
of an sudden growth in the volatility level. The situation
seems to be absolutely reversed in Fig. 2.b, where the
possible change in the volatility would imply a reduction
in its value. The inset of the Fig. 2.a, however, clearly
shows that in the ﬁrst case all prices, apart from the
undisturbed one, decay with the same exponent. And
this exponent is fully determined by the parameter values
after the change. Note that this feature was also present
β±
in Fig. 1.a. In these two examples we have

We ﬁnally show how we can use the result in Eq. (11)
to obtain the moments of the exercise time thanks to
Eq. (5).
In particular we present the mean value of
this ﬁrst-passage time when the location of the boundary

6
does not depend on r, as in the case of binary options,
H0 = K0. We will assume that the drift terms are both
positive, θa,b > 0, and that the process starts below the
barrier. Therefore we are computing the mean lifetime
of a perpetual binary call:

We must recall that the proper way of performing the
computation in Eq. (5) is by assuming that r, λ, θa, θb,
σa and σb are the free parameters. Of course, once we
have formally set r = 0 and obtained Eq. (14), we have
σ2
to demand that θa,b = r
a,b/2, and use the
−
true market value of these quantities. Otherwise we will
depart from the risk neutral measure, and thus obtain
wrong results from the ﬁnancial point of view. In Fig. 3
we have depicted the mean lifetime of binary calls under
the following market conditions: r = 3.5%, δa = 1.5%,
δb = 0% and σa = σb = 10%. Obviously the fact that
the drift is bigger after the transition reduces the mean
time as the likelihood of the change increases.

FIG. 3: (Color online) Mean exercise time of a perpetual bi-

of the option, in terms of the moneyness (S0/K0), for diﬀerent
values of λ. The values for the parameters are: θa = 1.5%,
θb = 3% and σa = 10%.

From Eq. (14) it becomes evident that the drift of
the process is determinant in computing the mean ﬁrst-
passage time, whereas the volatility plays a marginal role:
in fact the value of σb appears only through θb, when we
demand the measure to be risk neutral. This outcome is

8

no longer true if we focus our interest on the second mo-
ment of the ﬁrst-passage time. For the sake of simplicity

we will assume that θa = θb = θ, but with σa
can observe how, even under the previous assumptions,
the second moment depends explicitly on the value of σa

if we are concerned with small values of λ. In fact, if we
confront Eq. (15) and Eq. (16) we realize that the ﬁrst
correction to the mean ﬁrst-passage time is governed by
the undisturbed second moment of the process, whereas
the net change in this magnitude comes from a factor
which does not depend on the moneyness. This eﬀect
is a direct consequence of the absence of any diﬀerential
drift.

S0/K0

FIG. 4: (Color online) Standard deviation of the exercise time
of a perpetual binary call without drift risk. We represent the
variance of the lifetime of the option, in terms of the money-
ness (S0/K0), for diﬀerent values of λ. The values of the pa-
rameters were adjusted in order to keep the drift unchanged:
θa = θb = 1.5%.

In Fig. 4 we plot an example of the standard deviation
of the exercise time that will illustrate this case in which
the drift remains constant. Clearly this is only feasible
if the value of the parameters are well tuned: r = 3.5%,
δa = 1.5%, δb = 0%, σa = 10% and σb = 20%. The
outcome ﬁts our anticipations, since the possibility of a
larger volatility increases the uncertainty about the mean
exercise time.

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK

In this article we have considered the implications that
the presence in the market of volatility and dividend risk

6
has for option prices. The proposed market model allows
random changes in both the dividend-payment rate and
the volatility level of stock shares, but in a very speciﬁc
way: only one change is feasible, and the ﬁnal market
properties are foreseeable. The model, however, is rich
and realistic enough to obtain valid ﬁnancial results. We
have focused our attention on the problem of pricing per-
petual American options: derivatives with no expiration
limit that may be exercised at any time. The absence
of maturity in a derivative departs from actual market
conditions, but it is a well-accepted approximation used
with the purpose of casting light on the way of solving
the whole problem. From a physical point of view, the
analysis of perpetual options may have even bigger inter-
est than real options because usually physical systems do
not disappear after a ﬁxed time lag.

Within this framework, we have obtained explicit so-
lutions for pricing derivatives with the most typical pay-
oﬀs: vanilla puts and calls, as well as binary options.
Nevertheless, the applications of our development are not
restricted to this few derivatives, because the outcome for
binary puts and calls may be used as a building block in
the search for new solutions to diﬀerent contract speciﬁ-

9

cations. In fact, as we have pointed out, binary option
prices are nothing but classical moment-generating func-
tions of a ﬁrst-passage time: the exercise time. We have
shown the right way of handling these expressions with-
out distorting their ﬁnancial meaning however.

We have also illustrated the results of our work with
a set of practical examples. The plots cover the major
issues we have analysed by showing several peculiarities
of the solutions that can be missed in a ﬁrst approach to
the analytical expressions.

Our aim is now to extend these results to American
derivatives with maturity date. It is probable that the
solution to this problem will imply the use of approximate
procedures and numerical techniques to some extent.

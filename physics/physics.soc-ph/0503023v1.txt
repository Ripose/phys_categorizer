Abstract

Large scale simulations of the movements of people in a “virtual” city and their analyses
are used to generate new insights into understanding the dynamic processes that depend
on the interactions between people. Models, based on these interactions, can be used in
optimizing traﬃc ﬂow, slowing the spread of infectious diseases or predicting the change
in cell phone usage in a disaster. We analyzed cumulative and aggregated data generated
from the simulated movements of 1.6 million individuals in a computer (pseudo agent-
based) model during a typical day in Portland, Oregon. This city is mapped into a graph
with 181, 206 nodes representing physical locations such as buildings. Connecting edges
model individual’s ﬂow between nodes. Edge weights are constructed from the daily
traﬃc of individuals moving between locations. The number of edges leaving a node (out-
degree), the edge weights (out-traﬃc), and the edge-weights per location (total out-traﬃc)
are ﬁtted well by power law distributions. The power law distributions also ﬁt subgraphs
based on work, school, and social/recreational activities. The resulting weighted graph is
a “small world” and has scaling laws consistent with an underlying hierarchical structure.
We also explore the time evolution of the largest connected component and the distribution
of the component sizes. We observe a strong linear correlation between the out-degree
and total out-traﬃc distributions and signiﬁcant levels of clustering. We discuss how

to dynamic processes.

1 Introduction

Similar scaling laws and patterns have been detected in a great number of systems found in
nature, society, and technology. Networks of scientiﬁc collaboration [1][2][3], movie actors [4],
cellular networks [5][6], food webs [7], the Internet [8], the World Wide Web [9, 10], friendship
networks [11] and networks of sexual relationships [12] among others have been analyzed up
to some extent. Several common properties have been identiﬁed in such systems. One such
property is the short average distance between nodes, that is, a small number of edges need to
be traversed in order to reach a node from any other node. Another common property is high
levels of clustering [4, 13], a characteristic absent in random networks [14]. Clustering measures
the probability that the neighbors of a node are also neighbors of each other. Networks with
short average distance between nodes and high levels of clustering have been dubbed “small
worlds” [4, 13]. Power-law behavior in the degree distribution is another common property in
many real world networks [15]. That is, the probability that a randomly chosen node has degree
k decays as P (k) ∼ k−γ with γ typically between 2 and 3. Barab´asi and Albert (BA) intro-
duced an algorithm capable of generating networks with a power-law connectivity distribution
(γ = 3). The BA algorithm generates networks where nodes connect, with higher probability,
to nodes that have a accumulated higher number of connections and stochastically generates
networks with a power-law connectivity distributions in the appropriate scale.

Social networks are often diﬃcult to characterize because of the diﬀerent perceptions of what
a link constitutes in the social context and the lack of data for large social networks of more
than a few thousand individuals. Even though detailed data on the daily movement of people
in a large city does not exist, these systems have been statistically sampled and the data used to
build detailed simulations for the full population. The insights gained by studying the simulated
movement of people in a virtual city can help guide research in identifying what scaling laws
or underlying structures may exist and should be looked for in a real city. In this article we
analyze a social mobility network that can be deﬁned accurately by the simulated movement of
people between locations in a large city. We analyze the cumulative directed graph generated
from the simulated movement of 1.6 million individuals in or out of 181, 206 locations during a
typical day in Portland, OR. The 181, 206 nodes represent locations in the city and the edges
connections between nodes. The edges are weighted by daily traﬃc (movement of individuals)

in or out of these locations. The statistical analysis of the cumulative network reveals that
it is a small world with power-law decay in the out-degree distribution of locations (nodes).
The resulting graph as well as subgraphs based on diﬀerent activity types exhibit scaling laws
consistent with an underlying hierarhical structure [16, 17]. The out-traﬃc (weight of the full
network) and the total out-traﬃc (total weight of the out edges per node) distributions are also
ﬁtted to power laws. We show that the joint distribution of the out-degree and total out-traﬃc
distributions decays linearly in an appropriate scale. We also explore the time evolution of the
largest component and the distribution of the component sizes.

1.1 Transportation Analysis Simulation System (TRANSIMS)

TRANSIMS [18] is an agent-based simulation model of the daily movement of individuals in
virtual region or city with a complete representation of the population at the level of households
and individual travelers, daily activities of the individuals, and the transportation infrastruc-
ture. The individuals are endowed with demographic characteristics taken from census data
and the households are geographically distributed according to the population distribution. The
transportation network is a precise representation of the city’s transportation infrastructure.
Individuals move across the transportation network using multiple modes including car, transit,
truck, bike, walk, on a second-by-second basis. DMV records are used to assign vehicles to the
households so that the resulting distribution of vehicle types matches the actual distribution.
Individual travelers are assigned a list of activities for the day (including home, work, school,
social/recreational, and shop activities) obtained from the household travel activities survey
for the metropolitan area [19] (Figure 2 shows the frequency of four activity types in a typical
day). Data on activities also include origins, destinations, routes, timing, and forms of trans-
portation used. Activities for itinerant travelers such as bus drivers are generated from real
origin/destination tables.
TRANSIMS consists of six major integrated modules: Population synthesizer, Activity Gen-
erator, Router, Microsimulation and Emissions Estimator. Detailed information on each of
the modules is available [18]. TRANISMS has been designed to give transportation planners
accurate, complete information on traﬃc impacts, congestion, and pollution.

For the case of the city of Portland, OR, TRANSIMS calculates the simulated movements of 1.6
million individuals in a typical day. The simulated Portland data set includes the time at which
each individual leaves a location and the time of arrival to its next destination (node). These
data are used to calculate the average number of people at each location and the traﬃc between
any two locations on a typical day. (Table 1 shows a sample of a Portland activity ﬁle gener-

3

ated by TRANSIMS). Locations where activities are carried out are estimated from observed
land use patterns, travel times and costs of transportation alternatives. These locations are fed
into a routing algorithm that ﬁnds the minimum cost paths that are consistent with individual
choices [20, 21, 22]. The simulation land resolution is of 7.5 meters. The simulator provides an
updated estimate of time-dependent travel times for each edge in the network, including the
eﬀects of congestion, to the Router and location estimation algorithms [18], which generate trav-
eling plans. Since the entire process estimates the demand on a transportation network from
census data, land use data, and activity surveys, these estimates can thus be applied to assess
the eﬀects of hypothetical changes such as building new infrastructures or changing downtown
parking prices. Methods based on observed demand cannot handle such situations, since they
have no information on what generates the demand. Simulated traﬃc patterns compare well
to observed traﬃc and, consequently, TRANSIMS provides a useful planning tool.

Until recently, it has been diﬃcult to obtain useful estimates on the structure of social networks.
Certain classes of random graphs (scale-free networks [15], small-world networks [11, 13], or
Erdos-Renyi random graphs [14, 23]), have been postulated as good representatives. In addition,
data based models while useful are limited since they have naturally focused on small scales
[24]. While most studies on the analysis of real networks are based on a single snapshot of the
system, TRANSIMS provides powerful time dependent data of the evolution of a location-based
network.

2 Portland’s location-based network

A “typical” realization by the Transportation Analysis Simulation System (TRANSIMS) sim-
ulates the dynamics of 1.6 million individuals in the city of Portland as a directed network,
where the nodes represent locations (i.e. buildings, households, schools, etc.) and the directed
edges (between the nodes) represent the movement (traﬃc due to activities) of individuals be-
tween locations (nodes). We have analyzed the cumulative network of the whole day as well
as cumulative networks that comprise diﬀerent time intervals of the day. Here we use the term
“activity” to denote the movement of an individual to the location where the activity will be
carried out. Traﬃc intensity is modeled by the nonsymmetric mobility matrix W = (wij) of
traﬃc weights assigned to all directed edges in the network (wij = 0 means that there is no
directed edge connecting node i to node j).

Figure 1: Structure of the location-based network of the city of Portland. The nodes represent
locations connected via directed edges based on the traﬃc or movement of individuals (activ-
ities) between the locations. The weights (wij) of the edges represent the daily traﬃc from
location i to location j.

3 Power law distributions

We calculate the statistical properties of a typical day in the location-based network of this
vitual city from the cumulative mobility data generated by TRANSIMS (see Table 2).

The average out-degree is < k >=

n
i=1 ki/n where ki is the degree for node i and n is the
total number of nodes in the network. For the portland network < k >= 29.88 and the out-
degree distribution exhibits power law decay with scaling exponent (γ ≈ 2.7). The out-traﬃc
(edge weights) and the total out-traﬃc (edge-weights per node) distributions are also ﬁtted well
by power laws.

The average distance between nodes L is deﬁned as the median of the means Li of the
shortest path lengths connecting a vertex i ∈ V (G) to all other vertices [25]. For our network,
L = 3.1, which is small when compared to the size of the network. In fact, the diameter (D) of

a social recreational activity at location 33005 at 19.25 o’clock and departs at 21.00 o’clock.

Highly clustered networks have been observed in other systems [4] including the electric
power grid of western US. This grid has a clustering coeﬃcient C = 0.08, about 160 times
larger than the expected value for an equivalent random graph [25]. The few degrees of sepa-
ration between the locations of the (highly clustered) network of the city of Portland “make”
it a small world [13, 11, 25].

Many real-world networks exhibit properties that are consistent with underlying hierarhical
organizations. These networks have groups of nodes that are highly interconnected with few
or no edges connected to nodes outside their group. Hierarchical structures of this type have
been characterized by the clustering coeﬃcient function C(k), where k is the node degree. A
network of movie actors, the semantic web, the World Wide Web, the Internet (autonomous
system level), and some metabolic networks [16, 17] have clustering coeﬃcients that scale as
k−1. The clustering coeﬃcient as a function of degree (ignoring edge directions) in the Port-
land network exhibits similar scaling at various levels of aggregation that include, the whole
network and subnetworks constructed by activity type (work, school and social/recreational
activities, see Figure 3). We constructed subgraphs based on activity types, that is, those
subgraphs constructed from all the directed edges of a speciﬁc activity type (i.e work, school,

generated from work, school, and social/recreational activities are: 0.0571, 0.0557, and 0.0575,
respectively. The largest clustering coeﬃcient and closest to the overall clustering coeﬃcient
(C = 0.0584) correponds to the subnetwork constructed from social/recreational activities. It
seems that the whole network, as well as the selected activity subnetworks, support a hierar-
chical structure albeit the nature of such structure (if we choose to characterize by the power
law exponent) is not universal. This agrees with relevant theory [17].

Understanding the temporal properties of networks is critical to the study of superim-
posed dynamics such as the spread of epidemics on networks. Most studies of superim-

[30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38]). Here, we take a look at the time evolution of the largest
connected component of the location-based network of the city of Portland (Figure 4). We have
observed that a sharp transition occurs at about 6 a.m. In fact, by 7 a.m. the size of the largest
component includes approximately 60% of the locations (nodes). Table 3 shows the size of the
largest component just before and after the sharp transition occurs.

from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.; and the full 24 hours. In the morning phase, the out-degree distribution
has a tail that decays as a power law with γ ≃ 2.7 (for the workday γ ≃ 2.43 and for the full
day γ ≃ 2.4). The distribution of the out-degree data has two scaling regions: the number
of locations is approximately constant for out-degree k < 20 and then decays as a power law
for high degree nodes (Fig. 6). The degree distribution for the undirected network (ignoring
edge direction) displays power-law behavior, but with slightly diﬀerent power-law exponents:
2.3 (morning), 2.48 (work day) and 2.51 (full day).

The strength of the connections in the location-based network is measured by the traﬃc
(ﬂow of individuals) between locations in a “typical” day of the city of Portland. The log-log
plot of the out-traﬃc distributions for three diﬀerent periods of time (Fig. 7) exhibits power
law decay with exponents, γ ≃ 3.56 for the morning, γ ≃ 3.74 for the workday, and γ ≃ 3.76
for the full day. The out-traﬃc distribution is characterized by a power law distribution for all
values of the traﬃc-weight matrix W . This is not the case for the out-degree distribution of the
network (see Figure 6) where a power law ﬁts well only for suﬃciently large degree k (k > 10).

two scaling regions. The tail of this distribution decays as a power law with exponent γ = 2.74
(Fig. 8). This is almost the same decay as the out-degree distribution (γ = 2.7) because the
out-degree and the total out-traﬃc are highly correlated (with correlation coeﬃcient ρ = 0.94).

4 Correlation between out-degree and total out-traﬃc

The degree of correlation between various network properties depend on the social dynamics
of the population. The systematic generation and resulting structure of these networks is im-
portant to understand dynamic processes such as epidemics that “move” on these networks.
Understanding the mechanisms behind these correlations will be useful in modeling ﬁdelity
networks.

There are approximately the same number of nodes (locations) with out-degree k = 1, 2, ...10.
For k > 10 the number of nodes with a given out-degree decays as a power law P (k) ∝ k−γ

concentrated near small values of the out-degree and total out-traﬃc distributions. The joint
distribution supports a surface that decays linearly when the density is in loge scale (Figure
??).

5 Conclusions

Strikingly similar patterns on data from the movement of 1.6 million individuals in a “typical”
day in the city of Portland have been identiﬁed at multiple temporal scales and various levels of
aggregation. The analysis is based on the mapping of people’s movement on a weighted directed
graph where nodes correspond to physical locations and where directed edges, connecting the
nodes, are weighted by the number of people moving in and out of the locations during a typ-
ical day. The clustering coeﬃcient, measuring the local connectedness of the graph, scales as
k−1 (k is the degree of the node) for suﬃciently large k. This scaling is consistent with that
obtained from models that postulate underlying hierarhical structures (few nodes get most of

Figure 7: The out-traﬃc distribution of the location-based network of the city of Portland
follows a power law (P (k) ∝ k−γ) with (a) γ ≈ 3.56 (morning), γ ≈ 3.74 (afternoon), and (b)
γ ≈ 3.76 (full day). Hence a few connections have high traﬃc but most connections have low
traﬃc.

exhibits power law decay afterwards (P (k) ∝ k−γ). The distribution of daily total out-traﬃc
between nodes in log-log scale is ﬂat for small k but exhibits power law decay afterwards. The
distribution of the daily out-traﬃc of individuals between nodes scales as a power law for all k
(degree).

The observed power law distribution in the out-traﬃc (edge weights) is therefore, support-
ive of the theoretical analysis of Yook et al. [39] who built weighted scale-free (WSF) dynamic
networks and proved that the distribution of the total weight per node (total out-traﬃc in our
network) is a power law where the weights are exponentially distributed.

There have been limited attempts to identify at least some characteristics of the joint dis-
tributions of network properties. The fact that daily out-degree and total out-traﬃc data are
highly correlated is consistent again with the results obtained from models that assume an
underlying hierarhical structure (few nodes have most of the connections and get most of the
traﬃc (weight)). The Portland network exhibits a strong linear correlation between out-degree
and total out-traﬃc on a log-log scale. We use this time series data to look at the network
“dynamics”. As the activity in the network increases, the size of the maximal connected com-

Figure 8: Distribution of the total out-traﬃc for the location-based network of the city of
Portland. There are approximately the same number of locations (nodes) with small total out-
traﬃc. The number of locations where more than 30 people (approximately) leave each day
decays as a power law with γ ≃ 2.74.

ponent exhibits threshold behavior, that is, a “giant” connected component, suddenly emerges.
The study of superimposed processes on networks such as those associated with the potential
deliberate release of biological agents needs to take into account the fact that traﬃc is not
constant. Planning, for example, for worst-case scenarios requires knowledge of edge-traﬃc, in
order to characterize the temporal dynamics of the largest connected network components [40].

Abstract

im-
The World Trade Web (WTW), the network deﬁned by the international
port/export trade relationships, has been recently shown to display some impor-
tant topological properties which are tightly related to the Gross Domestic Product
of world countries. While our previous analysis focused on the static, undirected
version of the WTW, here we address its full evolving, directed description. This
is accomplished by exploiting the peculiar reciprocity structure of the WTW to
recover the directed nature of international trade channels, and by studying the
temporal dependence of the parameters describing the WTW topology.

1 Introduction

The internal structure of many biological, social and economic systems dis-
plays complex topological properties such as clustering, a scale-free degree
distribution and the presence of degree correlations, which are not reproduced
by simple random graph models [1]. The global trade activity is one example of
a large-scale system whose internal structure can be represented and modeled
by a graph [2,3]. In the most general case, from publicly available annual trade
data [4] it is possible to deﬁne the evolving World Trade Web (WTW in the
following), where each world country is represented by a vertex and the ﬂow of
money between two trading countries is represented by a directed link between
them: if i imports some good from country j during the year t, then a link from
i to j is drawn in the t-th snapshot of the graph, corresponding to a nonzero

entry aji(t) = 1 in the corresponding adjacency matrix. Otherwise, no link is
drawn from i to j and aji(t) = 0. Note that the direction of the link always
follows that of the wealth ﬂow, since exported (imported) goods correspond
to wealth ﬂowing in (out). In such a description, if N(t) denotes the number
N (t)
of world countries during year t, the in-degree kin
j=1 aij(t) and the
N (t)
out-degree kout
j=1 aji(t) of a country i correspond to the number of
countries importing from and exporting to i respectively.

i (t) = P

(t) = P

i

The structure of the WTW continuously changes in time due to variations
in the number N(t) of world countries and to the continuous rearrangement
of its connections, and hence of aij(t). While previous studies focused on the
undirected description of a single snapshot of the WTW [2,3], in the present
work we study the properties of the WTW as a directed and evolving network
and we conﬁrm that its topology always displays a peculiar dependence on
the Gross Domestic Product of world countries, in excellent accordance with
the so-called ﬁtness model [5]. We ﬁrst review the previous results and then
extend them by reporting the temporal evolution of the relevant parameters.
Our analysis is based on a comprehensive dataset [4] reporting the annual
trade activity between all world countries together with the annual values of
their total Gross Domestic Product during the period 1950-1996.

2 Topology of the WTW

Two recent papers document some interesting static topological properties
of the WTW viewed as an undirected network [2,3]. In such a representa-
tion, each pair of vertices i, j is considered connected if i and j trade in at
least one direction. Before reviewing these results, we ﬁrst give the explicit
expressions linking the directed and undirected versions of a graph. From a
graph-theoretic point of view, if aij is the adjacency matrix of a directed
graph, then the undirected version of the same graph is described by the sym-
metric adjacency matrix bij ≡ aij + aji − aijaji. Correspondingly, the quanti-
ties kin
i = Pj aji computed on the directed graph and the
‘undirected’ degree ki = Pj bij computed on its undirected version are related
through the following equation:

i = Pj aij and kout

ki = kin

i + kout

i − k↔
i

(1)

where we have introduced the reciprocal degree [6] k↔
i ≡ Pj aijaji, deﬁned as
the number of neighbours of i with double (reciprocal) connections to and
from i. While in principle there is an obvious loss of information in using the
undirected version of a directed graph, in a recent paper [6] we showed that for
the particular case of the WTW there are two important empirical properties

that allow to recover the directed character from its undirected description.
Firstly, one always observes that approximately kin
i (t) ≈ kout
(t) ∀i, t. Sec-
ondly (see ﬁg.1a), a linear relation holds between k↔
i (t) and the total degree

where r(t) is the reciprocity, deﬁned as the ratio of the number L↔(t) of links
pointing in both directions to the total number of links L(t):

r(t) ≡

The annual values of r(t) for the 1950-1996 time interval are shown in ﬁg.1b.
The above results allow to obtain the properties of the WTW, viewed as a
directed graph, from its undirected version. For instance, eqs. (1,2) imply

kin
i (t) ≈ kout

kT

and a relation between L and the number Lu of links in the undirected network:

As a consequence, in the following we can simply address the topology of
the undirected WTW and then recover, at any timestep t, its full directed

description through the value of r(t). For simplicity, we now review the results
corresponding to a single snapshot (the year 1995) of the undirected WTW
[3]. An important result that we report here is that the same qualitative trends
are observed for each year in the database (1950-1996) and can be described
quantitatively by plotting the temporal evolution of the relevant parameters.
For instance, in ﬁg.1c we show the evolution of the number of countries N(t)
during such time interval. For the 1995 data, the number of countries equals
N = 191.

One ﬁrst-order topological property is the degree distribution P (k). In ref.[3]
we showed that, contrary to previous results [2] suggesting a power-law form
of the distribution with exponent −1.6, the scale-free behaviour is suppressed
by a sharp cut-oﬀ, which is actually restricted to a narrow region (see ﬁg.2a,
where a power law with exponent −1.6 is shown as a comparison).

A second-order topological property, related to the form of the two-vertices
joint degree distribution P (k, k′), is obtained by plotting the average nearest
neighbour degree (ANND), deﬁned as K nn
ki Pj bijkj, versus the degree ki
(see ﬁg.2b). The decreasing trend shown in the ﬁgure clearly signals that the
degrees of neighbouring vertices are anticorrelated, or in other words that the
WTW is a disassortative network [7]. From an economic point of view, this
means that countries with many trade partners are on average connected to
countries with few partners [2,3].

Finally, the third-order correlation structure (related to the three-vertices joint
degree distribution) can be investigated by plotting the clustering coeﬃcient
Ci =
ki(ki−1) Pj6=i Pk6=i,j bijbjkbki versus the degree ki. As shown in ﬁg.2c, the
trend is again decreasing, meaning that the partners of well connected coun-
tries are less interconnected than those of poorly connected ones [2,3], a prop-
erty sometimes referred to as hierarchy.

3 The ﬁtness network model and the role of the GDP

A very intriguing result [3] is that the above topological properties of the
WTW are in excellent agreement with the predictions of the ﬁtness network
model [5], assuming that the probability that two vertices are connected is a
function of some hidden variable or ﬁtness associated to each of them (again,
we are considering the WTW as an undirected network). In other words,
if each vertex i is assigned a ﬁtness value xi, the model assumes that the
probability pij that i and j are connected is a function p(xi, xj) of xi and
xj alone. All the expected topological properties therefore depend only on
the functional form of p(x, y) and on the ﬁtness distribution ρ(x). For the
WTW, we showed that the Gross Domestic Product (GDP in the following)
of a country can be successfully identiﬁed with the ﬁtness of the corresponding
vertex [3]. Extending the formalism to the evolving case, if wi(t) denotes the
GDP of country i at time t we can introduce the adimensional variable

xi(t) ≡

wi(t)
hwi(t)

=

wi(t)
N (t)
j=1 wj(t)/N(t)

P

and interpret it as the ﬁtness of vertex i. Then, once the form of p(x, y) is
chosen, all the expected topological properties predicted by the model can be
compared with the empirical ones. If at every timestep t the GDP is regarded
as (proportional to) the potential number of trade connections that a country
can develop, then the natural choice for pt(x, y) reads [8]

pt[xi(t), xj(t)] =

δ(t)xi(t)xj(t)
1 + δ(t)xi(t)xj(t)

where δ(t) > 0 is the only free parameter of the model. The above form ensures
that, at a given timestep, diﬀerent realizations of the network with the same
degree sequence {ki(t)}N (t)
i=1 are equiprobable [8]. The parameter δ(t) can be
ﬁxed by requiring that the expected number of links in the undirected WTW

equals the observed one Lu(t). After that, the topology is completely speciﬁed:
the expected degree distribution is obtained by computing the expected degree

˜Lu(t) =

while the expected average nearest neighbour degree is

i (t) = Pj6=i Pk6=j pt[xi(t), xj(t)]pt[xj(t), xk(t)]
˜K nn

˜ki(t)

(10)

and the expected clustering coeﬃcient is

˜Ci(t) = Pj6=i Pk6=j,i pt[xi(t), xj(t)]pt[xj(t), xk(t)]pt[xk(t), xi(t)]

(11)

˜ki(t)[˜ki(t) − 1]

For instance, for the year 1995 we found that δ(1995) = 78.6 in order to have
˜Lu(1995) = Lu(1995) [3]. The expected properties given by eqs.(9,10,11) ob-
tained with this choice are shown in ﬁg.2 as solid lines superimposed to the
empirical points. The accordance is excellent, indicating that the model indeed
captures the basic aspects of the WTW topology. The comprehensive analysis
of the whole data set that we are presenting here conﬁrms that the same is
true for each snapshot of the network. We can describe the time evolution
in a compact way by studying the temporal change of the statistical GDP
distribution and of the parameter δ(t) (see ﬁgs.3a-b). More speciﬁcally, note
that the discrete sums Pi on the r.h.s. of eqs.(9,10,11) can be replaced [5] by
integrals of the form N(t) R dxρ(x, t) where ρ(x, t) denotes the ﬁtness distri-
bution at time t. Therefore, besides δ(t), the model predictions only depend
on N(t) and ρ(x, t) and the evolution of these three quantities completely
speciﬁes the evolution of the network (together with r(t) if one is interested in
the directed character of the WTW). In ﬁg.3a we plot the ﬁtness distribution
∞
in its cumulative form ρ>(x, t) = R
x ρ(y, t)dy. We ﬁnd that the tail of the
distribution always collapses to a time-independent Pareto tail with exponent
-1, corresponding to a power-law ρ(x, t) ≈ ρ(x) ∝ x−2. The evolution of δ(t)
during the 1950-1996 time interval is instead shown in ﬁg.3b.

4 Discussion and conclusions

A very important goal would be to relate the time variation of the parame-
ters to the minimum possible number of external, unpredictable factors. For
instance, the variation of N(t) is of course due to complicated geopolitical
reasons and should therefore be taken as an input information. By contrast,
the seemingly irregular behaviour of δ(t) can be probably explained in terms
of more regular quantities. For instance, we recall that δ(t) determines the
number of links Lu(t) = 2−r(t)
2 L(t) and is therefore related to the link density
z(t) ≡
N (t)[N (t)−1] (ratio of observed to possible links). Interestingly, we ﬁnd
that z(t) displays relatively small ﬂuctuations about the value 0.4 (see ﬁg.3c),

a result related to the way new links form in the network (for instance, when
a country ‘splits’ in two or more countries, these can ‘inherit’ the links of
the initial country). The form and evolution of ρ(x) has to be traced back to
the dynamics of the GDP that takes place on the network. Models of wealth
dynamics on complex networks [9,10,11,12] highlight how the topology deter-
mines the form of the wealth distribution. The results discussed here show
that the reverse is also true, and therefore lead us to the intriguing picture of
a countinuous feedback between dynamics and topology, a scenario that inti-
mately relates the results of network theory to those of economic modelling.

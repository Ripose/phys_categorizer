In this paper we present the analysis of Wikipedias as complex networks. The hyperlinks pointing
from one Wiki article to another are treated as directed links while articles themselves represent the
nodes of the network. We show many universal quantities common to diﬀerent language versions
of Wikipedia such as their scale-free structure, topology, reciprocity, clustering, disassortativity
and triad signiﬁcance proﬁle. The growth process of a Wikipedia is studied using the ensemble
of Wikipedias in diﬀerent languages. We also report similarities between Wikipedias and other
previously studied networks.

I.

INTRODUCTION

In the last few years the physics community has paid a
lot of attention to the ﬁeld of complex networks. A con-
siderable amount of research has been done on diﬀerent
real world networks, complex network theory and mathe-
matical models [1, 2, 3, 4]. Many real world systems can
be described as complex networks: WWW [5], internet
routers [6, 7, 8], proteins [9] and scientiﬁc collaborations
[10], among others. Complex network theory beneﬁtted
from the study of such networks both from the motiva-
tional aspect as well as from the new problems that arise
with every newly analyzed system.

In this paper we will present an analysis of Wikipedias
in diﬀerent languages as complex networks. Wikipedia
[11] is a web-based encyclopedia with an unusual editorial
policy that anybody can freely edit and crosslink articles
as long as one follows a simple set of rules. Although
there has been a lot of debate on the quality of Wikipedia
articles, recent ﬁndings reported in [12] suggest that the
accuracy of the English Wikipedia is not much worse than
that of the editorially compiled encyclopedias such as
Encyclopaedia Britannica.

The important facts for this paper are: 1. that au-
thors are encouraged to link out of their articles, and 2.
that each Wikipedia is a product of a cooperative com-
munity. The former comes in part from the need for lex-
icographic links providing context for the topic at hand,
and in part from the fact that the oﬃcial Wikipedia ar-
ticle count, serving as the main criterion for comparing
encyclopedia sizes, includes only articles that contain an
out-link. A community arises initially from the need to
follow the central Wikipedia policy of the neutral point
of view (NPOV): if there is a dispute regarding the con-
tent of an article, eﬀectively all the opposing views and
arguments regarding the topic should be addressed. Al-
though there are many occasional contributors, the bulk
of the work is done by a minority: roughly 10% of con-
tributors edit 80% of the articles, and the diﬀering degree
of authors’ involvement serves as a rough criterion for a

meritocracy. Hence, there is no central structure that
governs the writing of a Wikipedia, but the process is
not entirely haphazard.

We view each Wikipedia as a network with nodes cor-
responding to articles and directed links corresponding to
hyperlinks between them. There are over 200 Wikipedias
in diﬀerent languages, with diﬀerent number of nodes
and links, which are continuously growing by the addi-
tion of new nodes and creation of new links. The model
of Wikipedia growth based on the “preferential attach-
ment” [13] has been recently tested against the empir-
ical data [14]. Although diﬀerent Wikipedias are be-
ing developed mostly independently, a number of peo-
ple have contributed in two or more diﬀerent languages,
and thus participated in creating diﬀerent Wikipedia net-
works. A certain number of articles have been simply
translated from one language Wikipedia into another.
Larger Wikipedias, also, set precedents for smaller ones
in issues of both structure and governance. There is thus
a degree of interdependence between Wikipedias in dif-
ferent languages. However, each language community
has its unique characteristics and idiosyncrasies, and it
can be assumed that the growth of each Wikipedia is an
autonomous process, governed by the “function aﬀects
structure” maxim.

Despite being produced by independent communities,
all Wikipedias (both in their content and in their struc-
ture) aim to reﬂect the “received knowledge” [15], which
in general should be universal and inter-linguistic. It is
expected that community-speciﬁc deviations of structure
occur in cases where the content is less universal than e.g.
in natural science, but it is also expected that such devi-
ations plague each Wikipedia at some stage of its devel-
opment. We thus assume we are looking at real network
realizations of diﬀerent stages of essentially the same pro-
cess of growth, implemented by diﬀerent communities.
By showing which network characteristics are more gen-
eral and which more particular to individual Wikipedias
and the process of Wikipedia growth, we hope to pro-
vide insight into generality and/or particularity of the
network models available.

II. DATA

The main focus of our study is to compare networks of
lexicographic articles between diﬀerent languages. How-
ever, the Wikipedia dataset is very rich, and it is not
easily reducible to a simple network in which each Wiki
page is a node, as various kinds of Wiki pages play dif-
ferent roles. In particular, the dataset contains:

• articles, “normal” Wiki pages with lexicographic

topics;

ticles;

• categories, Wiki pages that serve to categorize ar-

• images and multimedia as pages in their own right;

• user, help and talk pages;

• redirects, quasi-topics that simply redirect the user

to another page;

• templates, standardized insets of Wiki text that
may add links and categories to a page they are
included in; and

• broken links, links to articles that have no text and
do not exist in the database, but may be created
at some future time.

We studied 30 largest language Wikipedias with the
data from January 7, 2005. Especially we focused on
the largest eleven, in order: English (en), German (de),
Japanese (ja), French (fr), Swedish (sv), Polish (pl),
Dutch (nl), Spanish (es), Italian (it), Portuguese (pt)
and Chinese (zh). Based on diﬀerent possible approaches
to the study we analyzed six diﬀerent datasets for each
language with varying policies concerning the selection
of data. We present our results for the smallest sub-
set we studied for each language, designed to match the
knowledge network of actual lexicographic topics most
closely. It excludes categories, images, multimedia, user
and help pages, as well as broken links, and replaces redi-
rects and templates with direct links between articles.
For a detailed explanation of the dataset selection issues,
please see our webpage [16]. A nice visualization of the
Wikipedia data can be found in [18].

III. RESULTS

A. Degree distribution

One of the most common features of complex net-
works is the scale free nature characterized by the power
law distribution of node degrees P (k) ∼ k−γ. To ver-
ify the power law behavior, we investigated ten largest
languages. The power law character of the in degree dis-
tribution is depicted in Fig. 11, and the calculated power
law exponents γ are presented in the Table I. To estimate

TABLE I: The table of γ power-law exponents for in, out
and undirected degree distributions for the ten largest lan-
guages. The exponents for all languages except Polish follow
the pattern γout > γundirected > γin. It is not a surprise that
the Polish language exhibits uncommon behavior having in
mind its unusual degree distribution depicted in Fig. 11. The
universal exponents have two errors. The upper is calculated
with the assumption that all exponents are the same and dif-
ferences are related to exponent estimation. The lower one is
calculated as a standard deviation of diﬀerent exponents in
the sample. It is important to stress that exponents are not
estimated from the degree k = 1, but from kmin for which the
estimated exponent is stable.

the exponents we used the maximum likelihood formula
and a nonlinear ﬁt for the cumulative degree distribu-
tion introduced in [19]. We did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant
size eﬀect on the exponents γ. The average γ for diﬀer-
ent languages is γin = 2.19 ± 0.07, γout = 2.6 ± 0.1 and
γund = 2.4 ± 0.06. Calculated average exponents and
their standard errors were obtained with the assumption
that diﬀerent realizations of the Wikipedia will have dif-
ferent exponents in the thermodynamical limit. If their
values tended to the same limit, standard errors would
be smaller as depicted in the Fig. 1. While in-degree
distributions in general clearly display the power-law be-
havior, as an example see Fig. 2, the power-law nature
of the out-degree distribution is much less expressed (for
an example where the power law is clear see Fig. 2). The
estimation for the out-degree exponent was calculated in
a distant tail where the estimated exponent was suﬃ-
ciently stable with respect to the minimal degree of the
ﬁtted set kmin. In the estimation of average exponents
a sample without Polish language values is also consid-
ered, as Polish contains spikes related to the calendar
pages of the Polish Wikipedia. The decision of the Pol-
ish Wikipedia community to heavily interlink calendar
pages using standard templates (e.g. the articles for al-
most every year starting with 5 CE link to all days and
months of the year and all years of that century) had
enormous repercussions on the degree distribution of the

FIG. 4: (color online) The number of directed links plotted
against the number of nodes in diﬀerent Wikipedias. The
growth of L is well described by N 1.14
. This result is very
close to a linear relationship and to determine precisely the
deviation from linearity, should it exist, the study of the his-
tory data for any given language would be necessary.

Polish Wikipedia as can be clearly observed in Fig. 11.
The exponents for Polish also diﬀer signiﬁcantly from
other Wikipedia exponents as can be seen in Table I. It
is interesting to mention that the observed average expo-
nents agree very well with the WWW exponents for Alta
Vista reported in [3].

Very recently a paper by Capocci et al.

on the
Wikipedia network structure [14] has appeared. These
authors use the complete Wikipedia history to study the
growth and structure of the Wikipedia as a complex net-
work. In particular, Capocci et al. ﬁnd that the mech-
anism based on the preferential attachment is adequate
for the description of the Wikipedia growth. This paper
also analyzes Wikipedia topology and assortativity. The
comparison of our results with the results in [14] for the
node degree probability distribution exponents shows the

agreement for the in degree exponents, but reveals a dif-
ference in the out degree exponents (Capocci et al. report
γout between 2 and 2.1 whereas our estimated average is
2.6). A possible origin of this discrepancy could lie in
the selected set of Wiki pages or the power law exponent
estimation techniques. Namely, because the out degree
distribution is often not a clear power law one can expect
diﬀerent results depending on the choice of the minimal
degree kmin from which one starts the estimation of the
power law exponent, as well as on the choice of the cut-oﬀ
degree kmax up to which a power law is ﬁtted.

The node degree probability distributions, presented
in Fig. 11 and Table I, exhibit a high degree of similarity
despite the fact that the corresponding Wikipedias diﬀer
in size by more than an order of magnitude. This ﬁnding
supports the assumption that the Wikipedias in diﬀerent

languages represent realizations of the same process of
network growth. An similar claim is expressed by distin-
guished members of Wikipedian communities [20]. The
ensemble of all available Wikipedias represents a series
of “snapshots” of the Wikipedia growth since Wikipedias
diﬀer signiﬁcantly in their size and the degree of devel-
opment and, therefore, cover many distinct phases of the
Wikipedia growth process.

B. Growth in size

In the light of the considerations of the preceding para-
graph, we report some interesting features of the growth
of the number of crosslinks L with the number of arti-
cles N using the ensemble of Wikipedias. The growth
estimated from diﬀerent Wikipedias is L ∼ N α with
α = 1.14±0.05, which is close to the linear increase of the
number of links with the number of nodes, see Fig. 4. A
regular distribution of the points in the plot of Fig. 4 fur-
ther corroborates the hypothesis of the universal growth.
A small diﬀerence of the estimated α and 1 is interesting
from the perspective of theoretical models aiming to de-
scribe complex network growth and structure. Namely, a
number of models assume that when a new node is added,
approximately the same number of new links are formed.
Such models lead to a linear relationship between L and
N and it is interesting that the ensemble of Wikipedias is
not far from this linear relationship. Clearly, the models
of complex network growth in which the number of links
grows with the number of nodes steeper than linearly are
also of interest in from the perspective of explaining the
Wikipedia network growth and structure. It would be of
special interest to compare the results obtained from the
ensemble of Wikipedias with the “snapshots” of the sin-
gle Wikipedia taken at diﬀerent stages of its growth. The
estimated growth also implies a slight increase of the av-
erage degree < kdir >∼ N α−1. The obtained power law
exponents are greater than 2 and therefore we can expect
very limited growth of the average degree, if any.

C. Network topology

In studying the relative sizes of the regions of the graph
we used a more simpliﬁed schema than the taxonomy in-
troduced in [17] and used in [14]. We consider two subsets
of the network: the giant strongly connected component
(SCC), where there is a directed path from every node
to another, and the giant weakly connected component
(WCC), where there is an undirected path between ev-
ery two nodes. The diﬀerence between WCC and SCC
includes the IN, OUT, TENDRILS and TUBES compo-
nents as well as some nodes classiﬁed by [17] as discon-
nected (DISC). The remaining disconnected nodes are
outside the WCC altogether. We present the relative
sizes of these regions in Table II. The sizes of the SCC
are on the whole larger than ones reported in [14], which

is probably related to the diﬀerent ages of the data sets.
It seems that the SCC gets more pronounced with time
which is possibly related to the fact that contributors
become more experienced in organizing the Wikipedia
structure.

D. Reciprocity

Another important characteristic of Wikipedia net-
work is the mutual reciprocity of the links. The average
directed degree < kdir > is compared with the average
undirected degree < kund > in Fig. 5. There is a strong
correlation between these two moments. Such a corre-
lation leads us to belive that the link reciprocity plays
an important role in the Wikipedia growth process. To
understand it better we measured unbiased mutual reci-
procity using the unbiased measure for reciprocity ρ:

ρ =

Lbd/L − ¯a
1 − ¯a

FIG. 6: The dependence of the clustering coeﬃcient C on
the network size N . Despite the signiﬁcant scattering of the
points, it is possible to argue that Wikipedia clustering coef-
ﬁcient decreases with the network growth.

Here Lbd represents the number of bidirectional links
that point in both directions i.e.
contain two recip-
rocal directed links, L is a total number of directed
links and ¯a is the density of the links in the network:
¯a = L/N (N − 1). The detailed theory of this measure is
presented in the paper by Garlaschelli and Loﬀredo [21].
The value of reciprocity for the eleven largest Wikipedias
is ρ = 0.16 ± 0.03. It is interesting to compare the reci-
procity of Wikipedia with other networks that could be
very similar to it. We found that the Wikipedias have
a stronger reciprocity than the networks of associations
(ρ = 0.123 [21]), but smaller than the network of dictio-
nary terms (ρ = 0.194 [21]), and especially smaller than
the WWW with ρ = 0.52 [21]. The diﬀerence between
the reciprocity of Wikipedia and that of WWW will be
discused later in the paragraph on micro motifs. The sta-
bility of the measured value of reciprocity suggests that it
is a very important quantity for the description of struc-
ture and growth of a Wikipedia-like network. Reciprocity
quantiﬁes mutual “exchange” between the nodes, and can
be signiﬁcant in determining whether and to what degree
the network is hierachical. There have not been many
papers dealing with the origin of reciprocity or network
evolution models that also capture this quantity.

FIG. 8: (color online) Clustering coeﬃcients of the Wikipedia
networks are found to be greater than one would expect from
a random network with the same degree distribution. From
the ﬁgure it is obvious that they cannot be explained as ﬂuc-
tuation from the expected value since the error bars of ex-
pected clustering coeﬃcient are far from the black line which
represents CW iki = CExp. A great diversity of the measured
clustering coeﬃcients can be explained by the fact that the
original network is directed, and its undirected representa-
tion is missing information important for the network growth
process.

E. Clustering and assortativity

The clustering coeﬃcient C is one of the most ex-
plored values in complex networks analysis.
It is the
key quantity in the structure of undirected networks and
represents the local correlation eﬀects in the node neigh-
borhood. We calculated the global clustering coeﬃcient,
equal to the probability that the two nodes connected
with a path of length 2 also have a mutual link i.e. a
path of length 1.

C =

3 ∗ number of triangles
number of connected node triplets

.

(2)

In order to estimate the clustering coeﬃcient we re-
garded the usual Wikipedia network as undirected: ev-
ery two neighboring nodes are connected with one undi-
rected link. The relation of the clustering coeﬃcients to
the network size is displayed in Fig. 6. Although the
data points are somewhat scattered, the general trend is

that the clustering coeﬃcient decreases with the size of
the network. This ﬁnding is consistent with other results
where clustering is a ﬁnite-size eﬀect [22]. It is interest-
ing to notice that the points which deviate the most from
the general trend (such as Polish or Italian) are also char-
acterized by deformed degree distributions. In order to
ﬁnd a better characterization of the Wikipedia clustering,
we compared the Wikipedia clustering coeﬃcients to the
expected clustering coeﬃcients of uncorrelated networks
calculated from the known degree probability distribu-
tion [22]:

Cexp =

(cid:0)(cid:10)k2(cid:11) − hki(cid:1)
N hki3

2

.

(3)

The comparison of the two clustering coeﬃcients is
presented in Fig. 7. It is important to stress that pe-
culiarities of Polish, Italian, Bulgarian and Serbian de-
gree distributions have enormous impact on the calcu-
lated expected clustering coeﬃcient in Eq. (3). The ex-
pected clustering coeﬃcient for Italian, Bulgarian and
Serbian is even greater than 1 which is obviously im-
possible. The peculiarity of those degree distributions
is a peak in the ultra connected nodes and it results in
a very large second moment (cid:10)k2(cid:11), which spoils the re-
sults obtained by analytical reasoning. In order to get a
better estimate of the expected clustering coeﬃcient we
adapted the algorithm from [24] for randomizing a net-
work with a known degree distribution, and calculated
average clustering coeﬃcients for 100 randomly gener-
ated networks. Comparing this clustering coeﬃcient with
the measured one, we found a signiﬁcant bias of the real
networks to form triangles, see Fig. 8. This is the re-
sult one would expect for the network of deﬁnitions, be-
cause it is obvious that the terms relating to one an-
other are expected to have more common terms. We also
calculated the assortativity coeﬃcient of the Wikipedia
network r [23] as a global measure of the degree cor-
relations. The assortativity coeﬃcient is slightly nega-
tive for all undirected (r = −0.10 ± 0.04) and directed
(r = −0.10 ± 0.05) Wikipedia networks except the Pol-
ish one, which is strongly assortative in the case of the
directed network (r = 0.38). The small values of the as-
sortativity coeﬃcient agree well with the more detailed
in [14]. These au-
analysis reported by Capocci et al.
thors concluded that there was no signiﬁcant correlation
between the in degrees of the node. Having in mind small
values of assortativity coeﬃcient we obtained, this con-
clusion is very reasonable, but a certain disassortativity is
deﬁnitely present in Wikipedia because of the overall neg-
ativity of almost all measured assortativity coeﬃcients.

F. Path lengths

(harmonic mean) for the eleven largest languages. The dis-
played average path lengths exhibit no signiﬁcant dependence
on the size of the network despite the fact that the studied
Wikipedia networks diﬀer in size by more that an order of
magnitude.

largest languages. The studied quantities are the average
path length of the undirected paths in WCC < lundir >
(calculated as an arithmetic mean) and the average path
length of the directed paths in WCC < ldir > (calculated
as a harmonic mean). For both of these quantities in the
largest Wikipedias there is no evidence of the scaling of
the average path lengths with the network size. More-
over, the < l > values for the largest eleven languages
are very close with a small scattering around the average
value of the sample, see Table III. For smaller Wikipedias
the values for average path lengths are more scattered,
which may be attributed to the combined eﬀect of the
the importance of
small size of these Wikipedias (i.e.
ﬁnite-size eﬀects) and the peculiarities of the communi-
ties developing them.

G. Triad motifs

The last quantity we present in this paper is the triad
signiﬁcance proﬁle (TSP) introduced in [24]. Assuming
that one can look at the Wikipedia as a representation
of the knowledge network created by many contributors,
one could expect a possible new superfamily of micromo-
tifs. The superfamily one would expect to be most similar
to the Wikipedia is the one that includes WWW and so-
cial contacts. The triad signiﬁcance proﬁle of Wikipedias
is depicted in the Fig. 9, and comparing with the results
of [24], one can see that the obtained TSP for Wikipedias
resembles the known WWW TSP. The TSP takes into ac-
count the reciprocity of directed links and based on it one
could naively expect that the reciprocity would also be
very similar to the WWW’s reciprocity, which we found
very diﬀerent from the Wikipedia one. The scaling of the

is given in Fig. 10. Since both of these triads repre-
sent triangles (see Fig. 9) they contribute to increasing
the clustering coeﬃcient. The Wikipedia TSP thus sheds
additional light on the large clustering of Wikipedia net-
works, Fig. 8.

IV. CONCLUSION

We have shown that diﬀerent language Wikipedia
article networks share some very universal features -
namely degree distribution properties, topology com-
ponent structure, reciprocity, degree-degree correlations
(disassortativity), average shortest path lengths, and the
triad signiﬁcance proﬁle. Comparing the obtained quan-
tities with other networks shows that Wikipedia may be-
long to a new class of networks. It is possible that the
speciﬁc properties of Wikipedias are related to the under-
lying structure of knowledge, but also that their shared
features have root in the growth process governed by
free contributions, neutral point of view policy and com-
munity decision making. The former explanation seems
more convincing, having in mind the Polish Wikipedia
which in some quantities diﬀers substantially from the
other investigated Wikipedias. Such a diﬀerence, we
found, is a result of a small editorial decision. We con-
clude that there are signiﬁcant similarities between the
Wikipedias on the structural level, which provides fur-
ther evidence that the processes generating these com-
plex, macroscopic objects share some universal features.

FIG. 11: (color online)This ﬁgure represents cumulative in degree distributions of the eleven largest languages. The power law
is clearly applicable to all of them except Polish. This discrepancy is related to the editorial decision of the Polish community
to heavily interlink the calendar pages using standard templates. This community decision produced a radical change in the
structure of the network. One should also note an unusual distribution for Italian, suggesting a similar cause.

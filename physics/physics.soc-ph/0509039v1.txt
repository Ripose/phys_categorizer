The Dynamics of Viral Marketing

Abstract

We present an analysis of a person-to-person recommendation network, consisting of 4 million people

who made 16 million recommendations on half a million products. We observed the propagation of rec-

ommendations and the cascade sizes, which can be explained by a stochastic model. We then established

how the recommendation network grows over time and how eﬀective it is from the viewpoint of the

sender and receiver of the recommendations. While on average recommendations are not very eﬀective

at inducing purchases and do not spread very far, there are product and pricing categories for which

viral marketing seems to be very eﬀective.

Introduction

With consumers showing increasing resistance to traditional forms of advertising such as TV or newspaper

ads, marketers have turned to alternate strategies, including viral marketing. Viral marketing exploits exist-

ing social networks by encouraging customers to share product information with their friends. Until recently,

it has been diﬃcult to measure how inﬂuential person-to-person recommendations actually are over a wide

range of products. We were able to directly measure the eﬀectiveness of recommendations by studying one

online retailer’s incentivised viral marketing program. The website gave discounts to customers recommend-

ing any of its products to others, and then tracked the resulting purchases and additional recommendations.

Previously, a few in depth studies have shown that social networks aﬀect the adoption of individual

innovations and products. Ryan and Gross [20] developed a model of innovation diﬀusion based on the

adoption of a new type of hybrid seed corn among Iowa farmers in the ﬁrst half of the 20th century.

Subsequent diﬀusion studies focused on everything from doctors prescribing the drug tetracycline [6] to the

adoption of defense mechanisms against hostile takeovers by the boards of directors of major companies [7]

(for a review see [19] or [21]).

Although word of mouth can be a powerful factor inﬂuencing purchasing decisions, it can be tricky for

advertisers to tap into. Some services used by individuals to communicate are natural candidates for viral

marketing, because the product can be observed or advertised as part of the communication. Free email

services such as Hotmail and Yahoo had very fast adoption curves because every email sent through them

contained an advertisement for the service. Hotmail spent a mere $50,000 on traditional marketing and still

grew from zero to 12 million users in 18 months [10]. Google’s Gmail captured a signiﬁcant part of market

share in spite of the fact that the only way to sign up for the service is through a referral.

Most products cannot be advertised in such a direct way however. At the same time the choice of

products available to consumers has increased manyfold thanks to online retailers who can supply a much

wider variety of products than traditional brick-and-mortar stores. Not only is the variety of products

larger, but one observes a ‘fat tail’ phenomenon, where a large fraction of purchases are of relatively obscure

items. On Amazon.com, somewhere between 20 to 40 percent of unit sales fall outside of its top 100,000

ranked products [3]. Rhapsody, a streaming-music service, streams more tracks outside than inside its top

10,000 tunes [2]. Eﬀectively advertising these niche products using traditional advertising approaches is

impractical. Therefore using more targeted marketing approaches is advantageous to both to the merchant

and the consumer, who would beneﬁt from learning about new products.

The problem is partly addressed by the advent of online product and merchant reviews, both at retail sites

such as EBay and Amazon, and specialized product comparison sites such as Epinions and CNET. These

3

websites have given new power to word-of-mouth advertising, because a product review by a single consumer

can now be accessed by all other users searching for the product on the site. For the case of consumer

electronics, over half of individuals research products via a search engine before making a purchase [4]. The

rating of products and merchants has been shown to eﬀect the likelihood of an item being bought [17, 5].

Further reﬁnements to online review sites include allowing users to rate the usefulness of reviews and to

specify whose reviews they trust. Richardson and Domingos [18] used Epinions’ trusted reviewer network

to construct models of network inﬂuence, as well as an algorithm to maximize viral marketing eﬃciency

assuming that individuals’ probability of purchasing a product depends on the opinions on the trusted peers in

their network. Kempe, Kleinberg and Tardos [11] evaluate the eﬃciency of several algorithms for maximizing

cascades given various models of adoption. While these models address the question of maximizing the spread

of inﬂuence in a network, they were based on assumed rather than measured inﬂuence eﬀects.

Another very eﬀective way to recommend products to customers has been to mine purchase patterns to

either present user-speciﬁc recommendations based on prior purchases or product-centric recommendations

such as Amazon’s “people who bought x also bought y” feature [15]. These reﬁnements help consumers

discover new products and receive more accurate evaluations, but they cannot completely substitute person-

alized recommendations that one receives from a friend or relative. It is human nature to be more interested

in what a friend buys than what an anonymous person buys, to be more likely to trust their opinion, and

to be more inﬂuenced by their actions. Our friends are also acquainted with our needs and tastes, and can

make appropriate recommendations. A Lucid Marketing survey found that 68% of individuals consulted

friends and relatives before purchasing home electronics – more than the half who used search engines to

ﬁnd product information [4].

Given the natural tendency of individuals to trust their friends’ opinions, several services have tried to

facilitate the spread of recommendations between friends. Netﬂix, a DVD mail-rental company, encourages

its customers to use their website to recommend movies they viewed to their friends. Yahoo Music gives its

users the option of displaying the music tracks they are listening to on their instant messenger client, which

can then be seen by all their Yahoo messenger contacts. It is this kind of direct recommendation via an

individual’s true social network that we study in this paper.

Our analysis focuses on the recommendation referral program run by a large retailer. The program rules

were as follows. Each time a person purchases a book, music, or a movie he or she is given the option of

sending emails recommending the item to friends. The ﬁrst person to purchase the same item through a

referral link in the email gets a 10% discount. When this happens the sender of the recommendation receives

a 10% credit on their purchase.

This study is novel in that we are able, for the ﬁrst time, to directly observe the eﬀectiveness of person to

4

person word of mouth advertising for hundreds of thousands of products. We can see what kind of product

is more likely to be purchased as a result of this type of recommendation, as well as describe the size of the

cascade that results from an initial purchase and subsequent recommendations.

Although the data gives us a detailed and accurate view of recommendation cascades, it does have its

limitations. The only indication of the success of a recommendation is the observation of the recipient

purchasing the product through the same vendor. We have no way of knowing if the person had decided

instead to purchase elsewhere, borrow, or otherwise obtain the product. The delivery of the recommendation

is also somewhat diﬀerent from one person simply telling another about a product they enjoy, possibly in

the context of a broader discussion of similar products. The recommendation is received as a form email

including information about the discount program. Someone reading the email might consider it spam, or

at least deem it less important than a recommendation given in the context of a conversation. The recipient

may also doubt whether the friend is recommending the product because they think the recipient might

enjoy it, or are simply trying to get a discount for themselves. Finally, because the recommendation takes

place before the recommender receives the product, it might not be based on a direct observation of the

product. Nevertheless, we believe that these recommendation networks are reﬂective of the nature of word

of mouth advertising, and give us key insights into the inﬂuence of social networks on purchasing decisions.

1.1 Paper roadmap

In Section 2, we describe the dataset, giving overall statistics for diﬀerent product groups. Section 3 describes

the observed sizes of information cascades and ties them to a simple propagation model that accounts for both

the predominance of short chains and the occasional large cascades. Section 4 describes the growth of the

recommendation network over time and for diﬀerent kinds of products. In Section 7 we measure the eﬀect of

receiving recommendations from multiple individuals, as well as how eﬀectiveness of recommendations drops

as more and more are exchanged between the same two people. We also report the dependence between the

number of recommendations sent and number of resulting purchases. Section 8 shows an interesting time lag

between when recommendations are made and when they are acted upon, corresponding to diﬀerent times

of day when individuals are likely to be shopping online or reading email. In Section 9 we show that some

categories of products (corresponding to diﬀerent communities of interest) have varying response to recom-

mendations. We also show that the preference of individuals to make personal recommendations compared

to posting a review on the website varies by category. Section 10 shows the interaction of various product

attributes on the recommendation success rate. Finally, Section 11 discusses the results and concludes.

2 The recommendation network

First we describe the recommendation network dataset. The following information is recorded for each

recommendation

1. Sender Customer ID (shadowed)

2. Receiver Customer ID (shadowed)

3. Date of Sending

4. Purchase ﬂag (buy-bit )

6. Product identiﬁer

7. Price

5. Purchase Date (error-prone due to asynchrony in the servers)

We represent this data set as a directed graph. The nodes represent customers, and a directed edge

contains all the information about the recommendation. The edge (i, j, p, t) indicates that i recommended

product p to customer j at time t.

The typical process generating edges in the recommendation network is as follows: a node i ﬁrst buys a

product p at time t and then it recommends it to nodes j1, . . . , jn. The j nodes can they buy the product

and further recommend it. The only way for a node to recommend a product is to ﬁrst buy it. Note that

even if all nodes j buy a product, only the edge to the node jk that ﬁrst made the purchase (within a week

after the recommendation) will be marked by a purchase ﬂag. We refer to the purchase ﬂag also as a buy-bit.

Because the purchase ﬂag (buy-bit) is set only for the ﬁrst person who acts on a recommendation, we identify

additional purchases by the presence of outgoing recommendations for a person, since all recommendations

must be preceded by a purchase. We call this type of evidence of purchase a buy-edge.

Next we deﬁne successful recommendations. These are the recommendations for which we can say that

they inﬂuenced the purchase of a product. All recommendations that reached a node before the ﬁrst purchase

are successful recommendations. To determine the time of the earliest purchase we take the minimum of the

time of the earliest incoming edge marked with a buy-bit and the time of earliest outgoing edge.

In order to identify cascades, i.e. the “causal” propagation of recommendations, we focus only on the

ﬁrst purchase of an item. There are many cases when a person made multiple purchases of the same product,

and in between those purchases she may have received new recommendations. In this case one cannot say

that recommendations following the ﬁrst purchase really inﬂuenced the later purchases.

(b) Japanese graphic novel

Figure 1: Examples of two product recommendation networks: (a) First aid study guide First Aid for the
USMLE Step, (b) Japanese graphic novel (manga) Oh My Goddess!: Mara Strikes Back.

To avoid these issues we identify cascades by deleting late recommendations. Given a product recom-

mendation network for each node, we delete all incoming recommendations that happened after the earliest

purchase of the product. This way we make the network time increasing or causal — for each node all in-

coming edges happened before all outgoing edges. Now each connected component represents a time obeying

propagation of recommendations.

Figure 1 shows two typical product recommendation networks: (a) a medical study guide and (b) a

Japanese graphic novel. Throughout the dataset we observe very similar patters. Most product recom-

mendation networks consist of a large number of small disconnected components where we do not observe

cascades. Then there is usually a small number of relatively small components where we observe recommen-

dations propagating. We also notice bursts of recommendations and collisions (ﬁgure 1(b)). Some nodes

recommend to many friends, forming a star like pattern. Sometimes nodes also receive recommendations

from two or more sources. A detailed enumeration and analysis of all observed cascades for this dataset is

made in [14].

2.1 Dataset characteristics

The recommendation dataset consists of 15,646,121 recommendations made among 3,943,084 distinct users.

The data was collected from June 5 2001 to May 16 2003. In total, 548,523 products were recommended.

98.9% (or 542,719) of all products belong to 4 main product groups: Books, DVDs, Music and Videos.

In addition to recommendation data, we also crawled the retailer’s website to extract detailed product

information. For each product we obtained the categorization into the product hierarchy, a list of similar

products, sales rating and all reviews and ratings together with time of posting. The lower rating, the higher

the sales for that particular item. There were a total of 7,556,174 reviews on these half million products,

with an average of 14 per product. The average product rating was 4.3 (on a 1 to 5 scale). There were

total of 519,138 diﬀerent product categories and a product belonged to 4.8 categories on the average. We

also note that after two years, out of 548,523 products 5813 (1%) were discontinued (the retailer no longer

provided any information about them).

Table 1 shows the sizes of various product group recommendation networks. For each product group

we took recommendations on all products from the group and created a graph. Column p shows the total

number of products in the product group, n total number of nodes spanned by the group recommendation

network and e is the number of edges (recommendations). The column eu shows the number of unique edges

– disregarding multiple recommendations between the same source and recipient. The last column nc shows

the cumulative number of nodes – we created individual product recommendation networks and summed-up

their sizes.

Note that the number of edges e sums to the number of edges of the full network, while the number of

nodes n does not, since a node can make recommendations on multiple products.

In terms of the number of diﬀerent items, there are by far the most music CDs, followed by books

and videos. There is a surprisingly small number of DVD titles. On the other hand DVDs account for

almost half of all recommendations in the dataset. The DVD graph is also the most dense, having about 10

recommendations per node, while books and music have about 2 recommendations per node and videos have

only a bit more than 1 recommendation per node. On the whole there are about 3.69 recommendations per

node on 3.85 diﬀerent products.

Music recommendations reached about the same number of people as DVDs but used more than 5 times

fewer recommendations to achieve the same coverage of the nodes. Book recommendations reached by far

the most people – 2.8 million. Notice that all networks have a very small number of unique edges. For books,

videos and music the number of unique edges is smaller than the number of nodes – this suggests that the

networks are highly disconnected [8]. Even if we compose a network using all the recommendations in the

dataset, the largest weakly connected component contains less than 2.5% (100, 420) of the nodes, and the

second largest component has only 600 nodes.

Dividing by the cumulative number of nodes we see that the average person in a product group network

sent or received recommendations on 3 book titles, 5.3 DVDs, 2.6 music titles and 1.8 videos.

Figure 2 shows the distribution of the recommendations and purchases made by a single node in the

recommendation network. Notice the power-law distributions and long ﬂat tails. The most active person

made 83,729 recommendations and purchased 4,416 diﬀerent items.

Even with these simple counts we can make the ﬁrst few observations. It seems that some people got

quite heavily involved in the recommendation program, that they tended to recommend a large number of

products to the same set of friends (since the number of unique edges is so small). Books tend to have very

sparsely linked communities, meaning that a small number of edges connected a lot of nodes. The same is

also true for music and video. DVDs on the other hand are densely linked both in terms of the total number

of recommendations and the number of unique edges. This shows that people tend to buy more DVDs and

also like to recommend them to their friends, while they seem to be more conservative with books. One

possible reason is that a book is bigger time investment than a DVD: one usually needs several days to read

a book, while a DVD can be viewed in a single evening.

One external factor which may be aﬀecting the recommendation patterns for DVDs is the existence of

referral websites (www.dvdtalk.com). On these websites people, who want to buy a DVD and get a discount,

would ask for recommendations. This way there would be recommendations made between people who don’t

really know each other but rather have an economic incentive to cooperate. We were not able to ﬁnd similar

referral sharing sites for books or CDs.

3 The recommendation propagation model

A simple model that tries to capture the propagation of recommendations throughout the network assumes

that each recipient of a recommendation will forward it to others if its value exceeds an arbitrary threshold

that the individual sets for herself. Since exceeding this value is a probabilistic event, let’s call pt the

probability that at time step t the recommendation exceeds the threshold.

In that case the number of

recommendations Nt+1 at time (t + 1) is given in terms of the number of recommendations at a time earlier

by

Nt+1 = ptNt.

where the probability pt is deﬁned over the unit interval.

Notice that, because of the probabilistic nature of the threshold being exceeded, one can only compute

the ﬁnal distribution of recommendation chain lengths, which we now proceed to do.

Subtracting from both sides of this equation the term Nt and diving by it we obtain

Nt

N(t+1) −
Nt

= pt

= X pt

If we sum both sides from the initial time to some very large time T and assume that for long times the

numerator is smaller than the denominator (a reasonable assumption) we get

The left hand integral is just ln(N ), and the right hand side is a sum of random variables, which in the

limit of a very large uncorrelated number of recommendations is normally distributed (central limit theorem).

This means that the logarithm of the number of messages is normally distributed, or equivalently, that

the number of messages passed is log-normally distributed. In other words the probability density for N is

which, for large variances describes a behavior whereby the typical number of recommendations is small

(the mode of the distribution) but there are unlikely events of large chains of recommendations which are

Furthermore, for large variances, the lognormal distribution can behave like a power law for a range of

values. In order to see this, take the logarithms on both sides of the equation (equivalent to a log-log plot)

So for large σ the last term of the right hand side goes to zero, and since the the second term is a constant

one obtains a power law behavior with exponent value of minus one. There are other models which produce

power-law distributions of cascade sizes, but we present ours for its simplicity, since it does not depend on

network topology [9] or critical thresholds in the probability of a recommendation being accepted [23].

3.1 Distribution of cascade sizes

The model predicts that sizes of cascades obey a lognormal distribution which for large variance leads to a

power-law distribution with exponent 1. To identify the cascades we deleted late recommendations (section 2)

and then measured the sizes of cascades (size of connected component) without the nodes that did not buy.

From ﬁgure 3 we see that the distribution of cascade sizes is heavy-tailed, but it is only for DVDs that

we observe a power-law exponent close to 1. The reason is the large variance associated with the DVDs,

which is not observed in the other product groups. We further investigate this in next sections.

3.2 Propagation characteristics

The stochastic model makes the general assumption that the recommendation behavior does not change with

the depth in the cascade. We did ﬁnd, however, that people who had received no prior recommendations

for the product through the recommendation referral program behaved diﬀerently from those who had. We

further examine the behavior of individuals who received a recommendation after 2, 3 and 4 propagations.

Figure 4 shows the cumulative out-degree distribution, that is the number of people who sent out at

least kp recommendations, for a product. It shows that the deeper an individual is in the cascade, if they

choose to make recommendations, they tend to recommend to a greater number of people on average (the

distribution has a higher variance). This eﬀect is probably due to only very heavily recommended products

producing large enough cascades to reach a certain depth. We also observe, as is shown in Table 2, that the

probability of an individual making a recommendation at all (which can only occur if they make a purchase),

declines after an initial increase as one gets deeper into the cascade.

4 Recommendation network over time

We traced the evolution of the recommendation network from the start to the end of the program. The

growth of the customer base was linear, adding on average 165,000 new users each month, which is an

indication that the service itself was not spreading epidemically. Further evidence of non-viral spread is

provided by the relatively high percentage (94%) of users who made their ﬁrst recommendation without

having previously received one.

We ﬁnd that, over time, customers are recommending to more of their friends. This results in a densi-

Figure 5: The size of the largest connected component of customers as a function of the cumulative number
of customers using the service. The inset shows the linear growth in the number of customers over time

ﬁcation of the network [13], with the average degree of a node increasing over time proportionally to n0.26,

where n is the total number of nodes. In spite of this, the network overall stays largely disconnected. As we

saw in section 3 that individual products produced large recommendation cascades only rarely, and those

reached on the order of a thousand customers. Even if we aggregate recommendations over all products, the

social network of customers stays largely disconnected. The largest connected component, although growing

quadratically with the number of nodes, still only increases from 1% to 2.5% of the network. The diameter of

this component increases from 7 hops for the 200,000 customers participating in the ﬁrst month, to 16 hops

for the 4,000,000 customers in aggregate over the full two years. Since the largest connected component is

very small, one could attribute the increasing diameter to the formation of the giant connected component.

With the total network being largely disconnected, we sought out smaller communities, which we identiﬁed

by the category of products that they bought. We found large variation in the size of the largest connected

component within each category. Of the 180 thousand customers who bought books in the home and garden

category, fewer than 3% belonged in the giant connected component. On the other hand, some of the top

level DVD genre categories had a giant component that occupied about a ﬁfth of the graph: 24% out of

18,000 users for westerns, 26% of 25,000 for classics, and 19% of 47,000 for anime (Japanese animated ﬁlm).

Other DVD categories were less well connected. For example, the giant components for the ﬁtness and kids

categories contained only 2 and 7 percent of their customers. The anime community stands out further,

because this relatively small number of people was responsible for 2.5 of the 16 million recommendations

in the system. We will discuss the recommendation patterns in this category and others in more detail in

section 9.

Table 3: Product group recommendation network purchase statistics.

5 Purchase statistics

We now describe the purchase statistics over the product groups. We create per product recommendation

networks, discard late recommendations and then count the number of nodes that purchased a product.

Table 3 shows the counts of the total number of purchases (bt) and the total number of purchases that

were made as a result of a recommendation (bs). Note that bt only includes purchases relating to the program:

either a purchase resulting for a recommendation or a purchase preceding a recommendation. A purchase

can be determined to be the result of a recommendation either via a buy-bit bb (a person got the discount)

or buy-edge (be), i.e. an incoming edge which happened after the outgoing edge.

We observe books having by far the highest number of purchases. But the number of purchases through

recommendations is much smaller. DVDs and books have both about the same number of purchases through

recommendations, and books have more than 3 times more total purchases. For books only 3% of all

purchases were can be attributed to a recommendation, for DVDs this increases to 9%, for music and video

it drops again to 1.4% and 0.8%, respectively.

Looking at the number of purchases that got discount, we observe that for books, music and video 78.6,

74.1 and 66.0 percent of purchases through recommendations resulted in a discount. For DVDs there existed

special websites where people listed email addresses to receive DVD recommendations (and eventually got

discounts). Based on this we expected that a large majority of DVD purchases would result in a discount.

Comparing the number of purchases through recommendations and purchases with discounts, we observe

that only 22.8% of the DVD purchases made through the recommendation system resulted in a discount.

Given the total number of recommendations and purchases inﬂuenced by recommendations we can esti-

mate how many recommendations need to be independently sent over the network to induce a new purchase.

Using this metric books have the most inﬂuential recommendations followed by DVDs and music. For books

one out of 69 recommendations resulted in a purchase. For DVDs it increases to 108 recommendations per

purchase and further increases to 136 for music and 203 for video. Note that here we are only comparing

the total number of purchases that can be attributed to recommendations with the total number of rec-

ommendations made. In these ﬁrst observations we are not yet considering the network structure, so the

lower eﬀectiveness of DVD recommendations can be attributed to the high density of the recommendation

network.

6 Forward recommendations

Not all people who make a purchase also decide to give recommendations. So we estimate what fraction of

people that purchase also decide to recommend forward. To obtain this information we can only use the

nodes with purchases that resulted in a discount.

Table 4 shows that only about a third of people that purchase also recommend the product forward. The

ratio of forward recommendations is much higher for DVDs than for other kinds of products. Videos also

have a higher ratio of forward recommendations, while books have the lowest. This shows that people are

most keen on recommending movies, while more conservative when recommending books and music.

7 Eﬀectiveness of recommendations

So far we only looked into the aggregate statistics of the recommendation network. Next we ask questions

about the eﬀectiveness of recommendations in the recommendation network itself. First we analyze the

probability of purchasing as one gets more and more recommendations. Next we measure the eﬀectiveness

of recommendations as two persons exchange more and more recommendations. One might expect that the

recommendation channel between persons who exchange more recommendations gets more eﬃcient. Lastly

we check the recommendation network from the perspective of the sender of the recommendation. Does a

node that makes more recommendations also inﬂuence more purchases? Do people that are more involved

in the recommendation network also tend to make more purchases?

In the following sections we answer these and some additional questions. For all experiments we ﬁrst create

individual product recommendation networks and delete late recommendations. With this preprocessing we

ensure that all incoming recommendations happened before the ﬁrst purchase of a product.

Figure 6: Probability of buying given a number of incoming recommendations.

7.1 Probability of buying in the number of incoming recommendations

First we examine how the probability of purchasing changes as one gets more and more recommendations.

We would expect that a person is more likely to buy a product the more recommendations she gets for that

particular product. On the other had one would also think that there is a saturation point – if a person

hasn’t bought a product after a given number of recommendations, they are not likely to change their minds

after receiving even more of them. One can ask how many recommendations are too many.

Figure 6 shows the probability of purchasing a product as a function of the number of incoming recom-

mendations on the product. As we move to higher numbers of incoming recommendations, the number of

observations drops rapidly. For example, there were 5 million cases with 1 incoming recommendation on a

book, and only 58 cases where a node got 20 incoming recommendations on a single book. The maximum was

30 incoming recommendations. For these reasons we cut oﬀ the the plot when the number of observations

becomes too small and the error bars become too large.

Figure 7: Probability of buying given a number of incoming recommendations. Zoom-in for DVD recom-
mendations (Figure 6(b)).

Figure 6(a) shows that overall, book recommendations are rarely followed, and even more surprisingly as

more and more recommendations are received their success decreases. We observe a peak in probability of

buying at 2 incoming recommendations and then a slow drop.

For DVDs (Figure 6(b) and Figure 7) we observe a saturation around 10 incoming recommendations. This

means that after a person gets a 10 recommendations they become immune to them – their probability of

buying does not increase anymore. The number of observations is 2.5 million at 1 incoming recommendation

and 100 at 60 incoming recommendations. The maximal number of incoming recommendations for a person

is 172 (and that person did not buy), and someone purchased a DVD after 169 recommendations.

In the case of music and videos the number of observations was very small (10 cases with 10 incoming

recommendations). Music seems to be immune to recommendations – we observe a very low eﬀectiveness

of recommendations at the beginning (up to 5 recommendations), then the probability of buying increases

up to 0.1. Since the number of observations drops bellow 10, it is hard to draw any conclusions. Videos

show diﬀerent behavior. The probability of buying reaches a plateau between 6 to 10 recommendations (50

observations for each point). As the number of recommendations increases the probability drops. We also

observe video recommendations to be quite inﬂuential as one receives more than 5 recommendations.

7.2 Eﬀectiveness of subsequent recommendations

We showed that getting more recommendations generally increases the chance of purchases, we also showed

that it saturates at around 10 incoming recommendations. Next we analyze how the eﬀectiveness of recom-

mendations changes as two persons exchange more and more recommendations. A large number of exchanged

recommendations between two persons can be a sign of trust and inﬂuence, but a sender of recommendations

can be also perceived as a spammer, who recommends everything she buys. The premise is that if a person

recommends a few products to a friend, then she may consider buying them, but if a person ﬂoods the friend

with all sorts of recommendations, then she probably won’t react to them anymore.

We measured the eﬀectiveness of recommendations as a function of the total number of previously ex-

changed recommendations between the two nodes. We conducted the experiment in the following way.

For every recommendation r on some product p between nodes u and v we ﬁrst determine how many rec-

ommendations were exchanged between u and v before r, and then we check whether v, the recipient of

recommendation, purchased p after recommendation r arrived. For the experiment we consider only node

pairs (u, v), where there were at least 10 recommendations sent from u to v. We perform the experiment

using only recommendations from the same product group.

Figure 8 shows the probability of buying as a function of total number of exchanged recommendations

between two persons. For books we observe that the eﬀectiveness of recommendation remains about con-

stant up to 3 exchanged recommendations. As the number of exchanged recommendations increases, the

probability of buying starts to decrease to about half of the original value and then levels oﬀ. For DVDs we

observe an immediate and consistent drop. At one exchanged recommendation, the probability of buying is

6.3%, at ﬁve exchanged recommendations it drops to 3.7% and later even further down to around 3%. This

experiment shows that recommendations start to lose eﬀect after more than two or three are passed between

the persons. We performed the experiment also for video and music, but the number of observations was

too low and the measurements were noisy.

Figure 9: Top row: Number of resulting purchases given a number of outgoing recommendations. Bottom
row: Probability of getting a credit given a number of outgoing recommendations.

7.3 Eﬀectiveness of outgoing recommendations

So far we examined the data from the viewpoint of the receiver of the recommendation. Now we look from the

viewpoint of the sender. The two interesting questions are: how does the probability of getting a 10% credit

change with the number of outgoing recommendations; and given a number of outgoing recommendations,

how many purchases will they inﬂuence?

One would expect that recommendations would be the most eﬀective when recommended to the right

subset of friends. If one is very selective and recommends to too few friends then the chances of success are

slim. One the other hand recommending to everyone we know and spamming them with recommendations

Figure 9 shows how the average number of people that purchased changes with number of outgoing

recommendations (top row). The bottom row shows the probability of getting a 10% credit given a number

of outgoing recommendations.

For books, music, and videos the number of purchases soon saturates and starts to drop (ﬁgure 9 top

row). It grows fast up to 10 outgoing recommendations and then the trend either slows or starts to drop.

DVDs exhibit diﬀerent behavior. The expected number of purchases increases throughout.

A possible explanation for this phenomenon is the following: the DVD recommendation network is densely

connected:

it has about 10 recommendations per node and around 400 per product, which is an order of

magnitude more than other product groups. The recommendations very soon start to collide, meaning that a

purchase was preceded by multiple recommendations. Every sender who sent a recommendation to the person

then records a purchase through the recommendation. So we ﬁnd that the more outgoing recommendations

there are, the greater the number of collisions and hence the higher the number of purchases.

The bottom row of ﬁgure 9 plots the probability of getting a 10% credit as a function of the number of

outgoing recommendations. Except for DVDs we observe the same qualitative behavior as in the top row.

For books, DVDs and music the the probability reaches a maximum at around 30 outgoing recommendations.

The probability of getting credit is highest for books where it climbs up to 15%. Notice that the DVD curve

now saturates, which is further evidence that the increasing trend of number of purchases can be attributed

to high density and collisions of DVD recommendations. This means that many diﬀerent individuals are

recommending to the same person, and after that person makes a purchase, even though all of them made

a ’successful recommendation’ by our deﬁnition, only one of them receives a credit.

For books and DVDs we actually observe super-linear growth in the number of purchases. Figure A-1

shows the power ﬁts of the probability of buying and number of purchases curves. The super-linear trend

stops at around 10 for books and 40 for DVDs. For the number of purchases the coeﬃcient of power ﬁt is

1.09 for books and 1.34 for DVDs. For the probability of getting a credit, the power coeﬃcient for books

remains about the same, while for DVDs the situation changes dramatically – the probability of getting a

credit (ﬁgure A-1(b)) increases sub-linearly.

7.4 Probability of buying given the total number of incoming recommendations

The collisions of recommendations are the dominant feature of the DVD recommendation network. Book

recommendations have the highest chance of getting a credit, but DVD recommendations cause the most

purchases. So far it seems people are very keen on recommending various DVDs, while very conservative

on recommending books. But how does the behavior of customers change as they get more involved into

the recommendation network? We would expect that most of the people are not heavily involved, so their

probability of buying is not high.

In the extreme case we would expect to ﬁnd people who buy almost

everything they get recommendations on.

There are two ways to measure the involvedness of a person in the network: by the total number of incom-

ing recommendations (on all products) or the total number of diﬀerent products they were recommended.

For every purchase of a book at time t, we count the number of diﬀerent books (DVDs, ...) the person

received recommendations for before time t. As in all previous experiments we delete late recommendations.

We show the probability of buying as a function of the number of diﬀerent products recommended on

ﬁgure 10. Figure A-2 plots same data but with the total number of incoming recommendations on the X

axis.

We observe two trends. For books and videos (ﬁgure 10(a) and (c)) the probability of buying is the

highest when a person got recommendations on just 1 item, as the number of incoming recommended

products increases to 2 or more the probability of buying quickly decreases and then stabilizes.

Movies exhibit diﬀerent behavior (ﬁgure 10(b) and (d)). A person is more likely to buy the more

recommendations she gets. For DVDs the peak is at around 15 incoming products, while for videos there is

no such peak – the probability slowly and steadily increases. Interestingly for DVDs the distribution reaches

its low at 2 and 3 items, while for videos it lies somewhere between 3 and 8 items.

The results suggest that books and music buyers tend to be conservative and focused. On the other hand

there are people who like to buy movies in general. Buying a book seems to be a larger investment of time

than buying a movie. One can see a movie in an evening, while reading a book requires more eﬀort.

The other diﬀerence between the book and music recommendations in comparison to movies are the

recommendation referral websites where people could go to get recommendations. One could see these web-

sites as recommendation subscription services – posting one’s email on a list results in a higher number of

incoming recommendations. For movies, people with a high number of incoming recommendations “sub-

scribed” to them and thus expected/wanted the recommendations. On the other hand people with high

numbers of incoming book or music recommendations did not “sign up” for them, so they may perceive

recommendations as spam and thus the inﬂuence of recommendations drops.

Another evidence of the existence of recommendations referral websites includes the DVD recommenda-

tion network degree distribution. The DVDs follow a power law degree distribution with an exception of a

peak at out-degree 50. Other plots of DVD recommendation behavior also exhibited abnormalities at around

50 recommendations. We believe these can be attributed to the recommendation referral websites.

8 The time lag between recommendation and purchase

The recommendation referral program encourages people to purchase as soon as possible after they get a

recommendation, which maximizes the probability of getting a discount. We study the time lag between the

recommendation and the purchase of diﬀerent product groups. For every purchase through a recommendation

we ﬁnd the time of the earliest and latest incoming recommendation before the purchase.

We present the histograms of the time lag between the purchase and the last recommendation with a

bin size of 1 day (ﬁgure 11). Around 35% of book and music purchases occurred within a day after the last

recommendation was received. For movies the percentage of purchases in a day after the recommendations

increases to about 40%. Between day 2 and 7 only 42% of the DVD purchases occur (55% for other groups).

For DVDs 16% purchases occur more than a week after last recommendation, while this drops to 10% for

other product groups.

plots.

By taking the last recommendation a person receives on the product, we measured the behavior of the

“time to think”. Observing the time lag between the ﬁrst recommendation and purchase gives the time

needed to gather the suﬃcient number of recommendations to trigger a purchase. Figure A-3 shows these

We observe about 35% purchases to happen within a day after the ﬁrst recommendation was received.

For DVDs this percentage is only 23%, and more strikingly, about 40% of the purchases occurred more than

a week after the ﬁrst recommendation was received. For all products the amount of sales from day 2 to day

7 was around between 50% and 55% (55% for books, 51% for music and 50% for video). For DVDs it was

much smaller, only 32%.

This shows that for DVDs people need to accumulate more incoming recommendations to react, but when

they decide to purchase, they do this sooner than for other products. One could also hypothesize that DVD

recommendations were not that successful, since the lag between recommendation and purchase tends to

be large. This suggests that people tend to purchase DVDs independently of recommendations. Maybe the

density of recommendations in the network was so high that we observed many successful recommendations

just by chance – a person would buy the DVD regardless of the recommendation, which is in agreement with

results from table 3 (columns bb and be) where DVDs in comparison to other groups have a small number of

purchases with a discount and a large number of purchases through the network.

We also examine the distribution of time lags for purchases that resulted in a discount (ﬁgure A-4).

When a person recommends the product, among all the receivers only the ﬁrst one to buy a product would

get a discount. Notice the nice daily periodicity and fast decay. The logarithmic ﬁt (dashed line) shows how

fast the buying rate is decaying. For books the coeﬃcient in front of the logarithm is

Figure 12: Time of day for purchases and recommendations for the whole recommendation network. (a)
shows the distribution of recommendations over the day, (b) shows all purchases and (c) shows only purchases
that resulted in getting discount.

On the other hand people could buy videos quite late and still get the discount.

8.1 Time of purchase

We measure how the number of recommendations varies over the day. For this purpose we created 3 exper-

iments: ﬁrst, we examined how the total number of recommendations varies by hour of day (ﬁgure 12(a)).

Next we examined how the purchases vary over the day (ﬁgure 12(b)). And at last we plotted the number

of purchases which resulted in a discount as a function of an hour of the day (ﬁgure 12(c)).

The recommendations and purchases follow the same pattern. The only little diﬀerence is that purchases

reach a sharper peak in the afternoon (after 3pm Paciﬁc Time, 6pm Eastern time). The purchases that

resulted in a discount look like a negative image of the ﬁrst two ﬁgures. This means that most of discounted

purchases happened in the morning when the traﬃc (number of purchases/recommendations) on the retailer’s

website was low. This makes a lot of sense since most of the recommendations happened during the day, and

if the person wanted to get the discount (had to be the ﬁrst one to purchase), she had the highest chances

when the traﬃc on the website was the lowest.

9 Recommendation eﬀectiveness by category

Social networks are a product of circumstances that bring people together. We tend to choose our friends

and acquaintances from the pool of people we had a chance to spend time with, whether it be in the

neighborhood, in school, at work, at religious activities, or in pursuit of a hobby. But not all circumstances are

equally inﬂuential in the formation of a friendship. A study [1] of student homepages found that individuals

participating in group activities such as sports were more likely to know one another than individuals who

24

share an activity which is usually pursued individually. The same study found that the smaller the number

of people sharing a particular interest, the more likely they are know one another (whether it is the friendship

that arose from the shared interest, or the interest that was shared between friends was not diﬀerentiated).

In certain contexts aﬃliation relating to a professional activity is more eﬀective at conducting an action.

For example, in small world experiments, where participants attempt to reach a target individual through

their chain of acquaintances, profession trumped geography, which in turn was more useful in locating a

target than attributes such as religion or hobbies [12, 22]. In the context of product recommendations, we

can ask whether a recommendation for a work of ﬁction, which may be made by any friend or neighbor, is

more or less inﬂuential than a recommendation for a technical book, which may be made by a colleague at

work or school.

By looking at recommendation behavior for various product categories, we can discern a few contexts

where recommendations are more inﬂuential. The categories are assigned by the merchant’s site and each

product may belong to several categories which are organized hierarchically. We ﬁnd that books of a

professional or technical nature are recommended and the recommendation is accepted more often than for

books tied to leisure activities such as ﬁctional novels or hobbies such as gardening which may be pursued

individually. There are sometimes of course exceptions, for example, Japanese anime DVDs have a strong

following in the US, and this is reﬂected in their frequency and success in recommendations. Another

example is that of gardening.

In general, recommendations for books relating to gardening have only a

modest chance of being accepted, which agrees with the individual prerogative that accompanies this hobby.

At the same time, orchid cultivation can be a highly organized and social activity, with frequent ’shows’ and

online communities devoted entirely to orchids. Perhaps because of this, the rate of acceptance of orchid

book recommendations is twice as high as those for books on vegetable or tomato growing.

9.1 Results by book category

Table 5 shows recommendation trends for all top level book categories by subject. For clarity, we grouped the

results by 4 diﬀerent category types: ﬁction, personal/leisure, professional/technical, and nonﬁction/other.

Fiction encompasses categories such as Sci-Fi and Romance, as well as children’s and young adult books.

Personal/Leisure encompasses everything from gardening, photography and cooking to health and religion.

We calculated several diﬀerent statistics for each category. Unfortunately we did not have the sales

data for the products during the time period that the recommendation program was run. Accurate sales

statistics would have allowed us to approximate the percentage of purchases that resulted in or were a result

of a recommendation. We did have a sample of sales ratings for 10,000 books at the very beginning of the

recommendation program, and the full list of sales ratings in June 2005 for products that were still available.

Because the sales rating of each product naturally varies over time, the sales were only weakly correlated

with recommendation volume, so we instead focused our analysis on reviews which were written during the

three calendar years, 2001-2003, that the program was active.

As an indication of the longevity of interest in a product, we took the ratio of the number of reviews

26

written for a product in the category for the period from January 2001 to December 2003 and the number of

reviews written for that same product in the ﬁrst six months of 2005. If interest in books did not fade over

time, we would expect to ﬁnd six times as many reviews in the three year period than in the six month one.

Some book categories aged much more gracefully than others. The most robust categories are Children’s

books (7.38), Teen (7.08), Parenting and Families (8.39) and Religion and Spirituality (8.93). Technical

books, especially those on the subject of Computers and the Internet (21.06), seemed to date most quickly.

Also, categories consisting mostly of page-turners, such as mystery and thrillers (14.71) and Romance (15.52)

faded more rapidly than general literature and ﬁction (10.68).

A second feature we examined was the relative number of recommendations to reviews posted on the site.

Surprisingly, we found that the number of people making personal recommendations was only a few times

greater than the number of people posting a public review on the website. For some product categories,

such as some VHS genres, the ratio was even below one. For books, we observe that ﬁction books have

relatively few recommendations compared to the number of reviews, while professional and technical books

have more recommendations than reviews. This could reﬂect several factors. One is that people feel more

conﬁdent reviewing ﬁction than technical books. Another is that they hesitate to recommend a work of

ﬁction before reading it themselves, since the recommendation must be made at the point of purchase. Yet

another explanation is that the median price of a work of ﬁction is lower than that of a technical book.

This means that the discount received for successfully recommending a mystery novel or thriller is lower and

hence people have less incentive to send recommendations.

Finally, we measured the eﬃcacy of recommendations by observing the ratio of the number of purchases

occurring following a recommendation to the number of recommenders for each book subject category. On

average, only 2% of the recommenders of a book received a discount because their recommendation was

accepted, and another 1% made a recommendation that resulted in a purchase, but not a discount. We

did not consider purchases that occurred more than a week after a recommendation, because those did not

qualify for a discount, and we can be less certain that they were a response to a recommendation.

We observed marked diﬀerences in the response to recommendation for diﬀerent categories of books.

Fiction in general was not very eﬀectively recommended, with only around 2% of recommenders succeeding.

The eﬃcacy was a bit higher (around 3%) for non-ﬁction books dealing with personal and leisure pursuits,

but was signiﬁcantly higher in the professional and technical category. Medical books had nearly double the

average rate of recommendation acceptance. This could be in part attributed to the higher median price of

medical books and technical books in general. As we will see in Section 10, a higher product price increases

the chance that a product recommendation will be accepted.

Recommendations were also more likely to be accepted for certain religious categories: 4.3% for Christian

27

living and theology and 4.8% for Bibles. In contrast, books not tied to organized religions, such as ones

on the subject of new age (2.5%) and occult (2.2%) spirituality, had lower recommendation eﬀectiveness.

These results raise the interesting possibility that individuals have greater inﬂuence over one another in an

organized context, for example through a professional contact or a religious one.

Finally, we can control for the possibility that individuals purchase professional books because they are

more likely to accept recommendations on a topic that they are passionate about. We examined the personal

and leisure category type, where books dealing with leisure pursuits, such as arts, photography, gardening,

cooking, and travel were often recommended, but the recommendation was not accepted as often as it was

for technical books.

9.2 Results by DVD, VHS and Music category

Unlike books, DVDs, VHS and Music CDs (with the exception of possibly the educational category for

videos), fell predominantly in the leisure and entertainment category. We therefore did not expect the

same distinction between professional and personal recommendations, but rather were seeking out product

categories which may be enjoyed by smaller, niche communities of viewers and listeners. Categories such

as movie classics and international and art house movies were more successfully recommended than comedy

or westerns. One of the most striking features of DVD purchase patterns is the dominance and success

of anime recommendations. While only 2% of DVDs sold in America are anime1, fully 22% of the DVD

recommenders in our dataset recommended anime titles. There was not only a disproportionate number of

anime recommenders, but these recommenders were unusually successful with 30 accepters per 100 anime

recommenders. For DVDs in other categories the success rate was about 8%. This observation suggests that

the anime community is either very closely knit or was able to use online forums eﬀectively to exchange

email addresses in order to obtain discounts. One anime fan commented on the existence of a specialized list

speciﬁcally for anime DVDs: “If you buy a lot of anime dvds, there is a large list over at the AnimeonDvd

forums. I get the discounts for anything new that comes out.” 2.

DVD and Video recommendations were accepted at substantially diﬀerent rates, possibly because of the

rising popularity of the DVD format during the past few years. Recommenders were 10 times less likely

to successfully recommend a video cassette than a DVD, which may reﬂect several factors. The ﬁrst is

that customers may be unwilling to invest in a purchase in the declining VHS format. An exception were

educational videos, with a 1.5% rate of success, which may reﬂect teachers purchasing videos for older VCR

players at school. Another possibility is that video content in general has a low conversion rate for purchases,

2http://www.cheapassgamer.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-19982.html

28

but that the observed purchases are a reﬂection of the well-organized DVD websites which allowed strangers

to grant one another discounts. To our knowledge, there were no such websites for titles in VHS format.

Anime was the only VHS category that had a signiﬁcantly higher success rate at 2%. Music similarly did not

show notable diﬀerence in recommendation success by top-level category, which is to say that customers were

about equally successful in recommending classical CDs and rap. Tables A-1, A-2 and A-3 in the Appendix

show the statistics for DVD, VHS, and Music titles broken down by category.

10 Regressing the recommendation success

So far we have examined how various aspects of product recommendation network individually inﬂuence

the purchases. Now, we ask how the features of the product interact with the success of recommenda-

tions. We describe each product with a set of attributes and ﬁt a regression line to model the success of

recommendations.

Each product is described with the following attributes:

r: number of recommendations

ns: number of senders of recommendations

nr: number of recipients of recommendations

p: price of the product

v: number of reviews of the product

t: average product rating

•

•

•

•

•

•

The dependent variable s is the success rate of individual product recommendations. We obtain s the

same way as in section 9, by dividing the total number purchases made through recommendations with

the number of senders of the recommendations. We decided to use this kind of normalization, rather than

normalizing by the total number of recommendations sent, in order not to penalize communities with lots of

big stars, i.e. a few individuals sending out many recommendations (ﬁgure 1(b)).

The pairwise correlation matrix is given in table A-4. From the original set of half a million products we

remove all products that have no purchases made through recommendations or for which the price was not

given. We end up with 48,218 data points. Since most of the variables follow a heavy tailed distribution, we

take their logarithms.

Table 6 shows the regression coeﬃcients. With exception of the average rating, they are all signiﬁcant.

The only two attributes with a positive coeﬃcient are the number of recommendations and price. This shows

that more expensive and more recommended products have higher success rate. The number of senders and

receivers have large negative coeﬃcients.

All this shows that successful products are the more likely to be not so widely popular products, which

have fewer reviews. While on the other hand they have lots of recommendations with a small number of

senders and receivers, which suggests a very dense recommendation network where lots of recommendations

were exchanged between a small community of people.

11 Discussion and Conclusion

Our analysis paints a fairly complete and varied picture of incentivised recommendation patterns for the

recommendation program. Although the retailer may have hoped to boost its revenues through viral mar-

keting, the additional purchases that resulted from recommendations, are just a drop in the bucket of sales

that occur through the website. Nevertheless, we were able to obtain a number of interesting insights into

how viral marketing works that challenge common assumptions made in epidemic and rumor propagation

modeling.

Firstly, it is frequently assumed in epidemic models that every time individuals interact they have equal

probability of being infected. Contrary to this we observe that the probability of infection decreases with

repeated interaction. Marketers should take heed that even if viral marketing works initially, providing

excessive incentives for customers to recommend products could backﬁre by weakening the credibility of the

very same links they are trying to take advantage of.

Traditional epidemic and innovation diﬀusion models also often assume that individuals either have a

constant probability of ’converting’ every time they interact with an infected individual or that they convert

once the fraction of their contacts who are infected exceeds a threshold. In both cases, an increasing number

of infected contacts results in an increased likelihood of infection.

Instead, we ﬁnd that the probability

30

of purchasing a product increases with the number of recommendations received, but quickly saturates

to a constant and relatively low probability. This means that individuals are often impervious to the

recommendations of their friends, and will resist buying items that they do not want.

In network-based epidemic models, extremely highly connected individuals play a very important role.

For example, in needle sharing and sexual contact networks these nodes become the “super-spreaders” by

infecting a large number of people. For power-law networks it has been shown that the presence of high degree

hubs results in an absence of an epidemic threshold: no matter how low the probability of transmission, the

disease will persist in the network [16]. But these models assume that a high degree node has an equal

probability of infecting each of its neighbors as a low degree node does. In contrast, we ﬁnd that there are

limits to how inﬂuential high degree nodes are in the recommendation network. As a person sends out more

and more recommendations past a certain number on a particular product, the success per recommendation

declines. This would seem to indicate that individuals have inﬂuence over a few of their friends, but not

everybody they know.

We also presented a simple multiplicative stochastic model that allows for the presence of relatively large

cascades for a few products, but reﬂects well the general tendency of recommendation chains to terminate

after just a short number of steps. Finally, we saw that the eﬀectiveness of recommendations varies by cate-

gory, with more successful recommendations being made on technical or religious books, which presumably

are placed in the social context of a school, workplace or place of worship. So despite the relative ineﬀec-

tiveness of the viral marketing program in general, we were able to ﬁnd a number of new insights which we

hope will have general applicability to future models of viral information spread.

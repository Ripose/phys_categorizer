Abstract

In this Note a social network model for opinion formation is proposed in which a
person connected to q partners pays an attention 1/q to each partner. The mutual
attention between two connected persons i and j is taken equal to the geometric
1 and mutual
mean 1/√qiqj. Opinion is represented as usual by an Ising spin s =
attention is given through a two-spin coupling Jij = JQ/√qiqj, Q being the average
connectivity in the network. Connectivity diminishes attention and only persons
with low connectivity can pay special attention to each other leading to a durable
common (or opposing) opinion. The model is solved in “mean-ﬁeld” approximation
and a critical “temperature” Tc proportional to JQ is found, which is independent
of the number of persons N , for large N .

Recently Aleksiejuk et al.[1] proposed a social network model for opinion for-
mation by introducing ferromagnetically coupled Ising spins on a Barab´asi-
Albert network [2]. The strength of the couplings between linked nodes, J,
was taken to be uniform, independent of the number of connections to a node.
Simulations of this model indicated the existence of a critical “temperature”
below which opinion formation is possible (two-phase coexistence) and above
which common opinion is unstable (disordered phase). A peculiar feature of
this model is that simulations indicate that the critical temperature depends
on the number of nodes, or system size, N in the manner Tc
log(N), so
that in the thermodynamic limit an initially imposed common opinion always
persists (in the absence of an external opposing “ﬁeld”), no matter how weak
the uniform coupling J between each pair of connected persons, or “partners”
[1]. Incidentally, this peculiar divergence of Tc with N is missed in the sim-
plest mean-ﬁeld approximation to the model [1], but is captured correctly in

an improved mean-ﬁeld approach [3,4,5], and agrees with exact results for
uncorrelated networks [6].

In the model of Aleksiejuk et al. the assumption of uniform coupling lends a lot
of inﬂuence to nodes with many connections. Indeed, overturning the spin of a
small set of most heavily connected nodes suﬃces for reversing the opinion of
the entire network. It is, however, questionable whether a node, e.g., a person,
with many partners (i.e., nodes to which he/she is linked) is able to inﬂuence
all these partners as strongly as a person with only a few partners would
be able to do. An intensive person-to-person discussion presumably creates
a stronger tendency to form a durable common (or, for antiferromagnetic
couplings, opposing) opinion than a one-to-many communication. Therefore
we propose to attribute an “attention” to each person, inversely proportional
to the number of partners. In network terms, a node with connectivity qi is
capable of maintaining an attention

αi = 1/qi

(1)

towards each of its partners, the total attention per node being normalized to
1. Thus we assume that each person pays the same total attention, qiαi = 1,
to the exterior. If the average connectivity is denoted by Q, qi < Q signiﬁes
“special attention” and qi > Q implies “little attention”. The model further
assumes that in order to establish a strong mutual inﬂuence of opinion, the
average of the attentions of two connected persons must be suﬃciently big.
Thus the average of their connectivities, qi and qj, must be small enough. In
particular, if both partners pay special attention to each other they are more
likely to maintain durable agreement (or disagreement). In contrast, if they
pay little attention to each other, opinion formation is diﬃcult. An interesting
mixed case is that of a person i paying special attention (qi < Q) to TV or
other mass media j (qj >> Q). Although the person may quickly form an
opinion dictated by the mass medium, this opinion is not strengthened by
loyalty or peer-pressure considerations and may quickly “ﬂip”. For example,
the person soon realizes that while he/she may be especially devoted to TV
(high αi), TV cares little or nothing about him/her individually (low αj),
which weakens considerably the persuasive power of the medium.

Along this line of reasoning we advocate that reciprocity of attention is im-
portant for durable opinion formation and an interaction is proposed which is
proportional to the mean - for calculational simplicity the geometric mean -
of the attentions of the connected persons,

Jij = JQ√αiαj

(2)

Note that the average coupling equals J, within a mean-connectivity approxi-

2

mation (qi = Q), which in the present social context is called a mean-attention
approximation. Taking the geometric mean leads to separable couplings, which
usually facilitates calculations drastically (cf. separable spin-glass models [7]).
Also note that, in this symmetric model, there is no directionality in the cou-
plings, Jij = Jji. At this stage no distinction is made between attention as
“speaker” or as “listener”.

For a start, it is straightforward to apply a double mean-ﬁeld approximation
as follows. For a given network realization (quenched randomness) the exact
self-consistent “equation of state” reads

< si >=< tanh(

sj) >,

qi

j=1
X

Jij
kBT

where the bracket denotes thermal average and kB is the Boltzmann constant.
Now we perform the quenched random average over all networks simply in
1/Q, and we also invoke the mean-
the mean-attention approximation αi
opinion approximation si
1 < S < 1, where S is the
average opinion. This gives

≈
S, with

< si >

→

≈

−

S = tanh(SJQ/kBT ),

which leads to the familiar critical “temperature” Tc = JQ/kB proportional
to the average connectivity Q.

In a more reﬁned step we apply the improved mean-ﬁeld approach of Bianconi
[3] and Leone et al.[4]. In this calculation an equation of state for the mean
local opinion < si > is found, of the form

< si >= tanh(

< sj >),

[Jij]

where the square brackets denote the quenched random average over network
realizations. Note that now the sum runs over all nodes. Speciﬁcally, for the
present model, and assuming a Barab´asi-Albert network,

Following Bianconi’s continuum approximation [3] the critical temperature is

where q(n) stands for the connectivity of node n. This also leads to the same
result Tc = JQ/kB.

In view of the fact that none of the spins on this network exerts an anomalously
strong inﬂuence on other parts of the network, one may expect that this model
behaves normally, so that, when ﬂuctuations are taken into account, a ﬁnite
critical temperature results which is independent of N, in the large network
limit. Indeed, in the model of Aleksiejuk et al. a highly connected spin si exerts
a local ﬁeld of strength J on a large set of qi other spins. Consequently, for large
N such centers of massive inﬂuence may well induce signiﬁcant deviations from
a “well-behaved” thermodynamic limit, as is corroborated by the simulations
[1].

In sum, an opinion formation model has been proposed in which each person
can devote a ﬁxed total amount of attention to others, distributing this atten-
tion equally over all partners. The Special Attention Network presented here
attenuates the strong inﬂuence exerted by highly connected nodes in networks
with uniform couplings J, by introducing a detailed local compensation of high
connectivity by weak interaction. Therefore, we conjecture that the essential
feature Tc
JQ captured here in the mean-ﬁeld approximation(s) holds true
also for the ﬂuctuating spin model on any quenched random Special Atten-
tion Network, scale-free or not, with ﬁnite mean connectivity Q <
. Careful
Monte Carlo simulation and/or more sophisticated analytical calculation will
be needed to verify this.

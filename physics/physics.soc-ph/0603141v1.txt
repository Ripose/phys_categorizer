Ideal-Gas Like Markets : An Exact Solution

(Dated: September 25, 2013)

We provide an exact solution to the ideal gas like models studied in econophysics to understand the
microscopic origin of Pareto-law. In these class of models the key ingredient necessary for having a
self organized scale free steady state distribution is the trading/collision rule where agents/particles
save a deﬁnite fraction of their wealth/energy and invests the rest for trading. Using Gibbs ensemble
approach we could obtain the exact distribution of wealth in this model. Moreover we show that in
this model (a) good savers are always rich and (b) every agent poor or rich invests the same amount
for trading. Non-linear trading rules could alter the generic scenario observed here.

Wealth and its distribution plays an important role in
society. Economic policies, natural resources and human
psychology are certainly important factors which govern
the distribution of wealth. However some features of the
distribution are independent of the details. As pointed
out by Vilferdo Pareto[1], a large fraction of the wealth in
any economy is always owned by a small fraction of pop-
ulation and vice versa. His empirical formulation, later
named as Pareto’s law, describes that the distribution
of wealth w follows a power law P (w) = w−γ. Recent
studies[2] of wealth distribution in several countries also
conﬁrm that it is indeed the behavior for the ’rich’, which
is only about 3% of the population. The rest follow a
exponential or Gibbs distribution. An interesting anal-
ogy [3, 4] has been drawn between the economic system
and a system of ideal gas where particles and their en-
ergies are modelled as agents and their wealth. Collision
between particles is similar to trading between agents
where energy or wealth is neither created nor destroyed;
it is just redistributed between agents. As pointed out by
Yakovenko[3], such a process obviously generates Gibbs
like distributions observed for the majority of the popu-
lation.

Then what is the origin of power-law for the rich?
Chakrabarti and co-workers [4, 5] pointed out that sav-
ing is an important factor which decides and dictates
the distribution for the rich. In a generic society agents
have diﬀerent opinion and concept of saving and accord-
ingly each agent saves a fraction of his wealth and invests
the rest for trading. The available wealth is then shared
randomly between two interacting agents. These models
generically predicts a power law distribution of wealth
with γ = 2. Later studies indicate that γ is not truly
universal and can be changed in certain speciﬁc cases. A
strikingly diﬀerent distribution of wealth is observed in a
system of like-minded agents (saving propensity is same
for every agent), where it is asymmetric and peaked be-
low the average. Numerically it could be well ﬁtted to a
Gamma distribution[6], however recent studies indicate
a discripency[7]. The exact form of the distribution is
still an open question and in this article we refer to it as

Gamma-like distribution.

There have been extenssive numerical [8] and a few
analytic [9] studies of ideal gas-like markets and its vari-
ants. However exact results are far from reach. In this
article we will focus on the exact solution of a generic
ideal gas like economy where saving propensities of agents
are random and distributed arbitrarily. A special case is
Chatterjee-Chakrabarti- Manna (CCM) [5] model, where
the distribution is uniform. Our results clariﬁes why
γ = 2 for most cases and also show a way of getting
a distributions with γ 6= 2. We have also pointed out
that in these class of models (a) good savers are always
rich and (b) every agent invests on the average a ﬁxed
amount for trading.

To be more precise about the model let us consider a
system of L agents having their saving propensity 0 ≤
λ < 1 distributed as g(λ). The agents are labeled as
i = 0, 1, ..L − 1 such that λ0 ≤ λ1 ≤ · · · ≤ λL−1. Let us
assume that initially total wealth is randomly distributed
among agents and the average is

¯E =

1
N Xi

Ei.

A pair of agents, chosen randomly in this model, ex-
change their wealth in the following way. Each agent i
saves λi fraction of its wealth and invests (1 − λi) frac-
tion for exchange. The available wealth for the pair i and
j is then shared among the agents in a random fashion.
Thus,

Ei → λiEi + ǫij[(1 − λi)Ei + (1 − λj )Ej]
Ej → λj Ej + (1 − ǫij)[(1 − λi)Ei + (1 − λj)Ej] (1)

where 0 < ǫij < 1 is chosen randomly for each trading
from a distribution h(ǫ) with average is r = hǫij i.

It is quite evident that when λi = 0, the model is iden-
tical to the ideal gas model, where particles encounter
random elastic collisions. In this case irrespective of the
initial distribution of energy/wealth, in equilibrium (af-
ter suﬃciently large number of collisions) wealth is redis-
tributed according to Gibbs distribution with a temper-

ature suitably deﬁned by ¯E. It explains the wealth dis-
tribution for majority which follow the exponential law.
To understand the origin of the power-law for the rich,
as explained by the authors of [4] we must introduce sav-
ings. However, note that the particles are no more id-
ntical once the saving propensity is diﬀerent for diﬀerent
agents. Then, ones saving propensity is his identity. It is
thus appropriate to study the ensemble of such systems.
The idea of ensemble is not new in statistical physics. It
is a collection of inﬁnitely many mental copies of systems
prepared under same macroscopic conditions. Physical
observables are then needed to be averaged over the en-
semble to get rid of the microscopic ﬂuctuations. Let us
study ensemble of N systems labeled by α = 1 . . . N , pre-
pared with same average energy ¯E. Thus in each system
{λi} are the same whereas the initial wealth is diﬀerent
in diﬀerent systems. Also diﬀerent is the sequence of
pairs (i, j) selected for trading and the sharing of avail-
able wealth between the pair (ǫα
ij ) during each trading.
Thus it is appropriate to ﬁnd out the distribution of en-
semble averaged wealth deﬁned by

where C has to be determined by the conservation of
wealth condition

(6) is quite general, neither r nor h(ǫ)
Note that Eq.
appears here. Even ǫij = r would generate w(x) same as
that otained from a distributed ǫij with hǫij i = r.

The distribution of w must satisfy P (w)dw = dx; thus

P (w) =

dx

=

Cg(1 − C/w)
w2

.

Here the quantity after last equality is derived using Eq.
(6) and Eq. (4). It is clear from (8) that the asymptotic
wealth distribution for a generic g(λ) is P (w) ∼ w−γ
with γ = 2. However one can choose g(λ) = ˜g(1 − λ)
to get a diﬀerent power-law γ 6= 2. For example, when
g(λ) = A(1 − λ)α deﬁned in the interval 0 < λ < 1 one
gets,

where Eα

is the wealth of individual i in system α.

Now we can proceed to derive an eﬀective model of
exchange for wi. First note that the pair of agents are
chosen randomly for exchange. Thus a speciﬁc agent i
interacts with diﬀerent agents in diﬀerent systems in the
ensemble and eventually interact with every other agents
when N → ∞. Second, that for a given pair i and j, ǫα
ij
is diﬀerent in diﬀerent systems and the eﬀective sharing
is hǫij i = r. Thus in the steady state,

wi = λiwi + r [(1 − λi)wi + (1 − λj )wj] .

(3)

For a large number of agents (L → ∞) it is easier to work
in the continuum limit by deﬁning a variable x = i/L.
Like λ, x is uniformly distributed in the interval (0, 1)
and hence one can equivalently deﬁne that an agent x
has wealth w(x) and saving propensity λ(x). For any
given model λ(x) can be obtained from the conservation
of probability element

g(λ)dλ = dx.

Thus Eq. (3) can be rewritten as,

w(x) =

{[r + λ(x)(1 − r)]w(x)

+ r(1 − λ(y))w(y)}dy

and can be solved as

w(x) =

,

which has been reported earlier [4].

To compare the exact results with the numerical sim-
ulations, we must understand certain existing numerical
diﬃculties of the model. First, that the saving propen-
sity is never unity. An agent having saving propensity
λ = 1 is a troublesome member of the system who never
invests and gains by interacting with other members and
ultimately owns all the wealth in the system. In usual
numerical simulations, the maximum saving propensity
for a chosen set {λi} is q ≈ 1. For example in CCM
model 1 − q is O(1/L). We must account for this correc-
tion while evaluating C. To do so let us look for a generic
system where saving propensity is uniformly distributed
in (0, q). In this case λ(x) = qx and using the procedure
described here one gets

w(x) =

with

C = −

(6)

So, for CCM model C ∼ ¯E/ ln(L). Alternately one can
calculate C as follows. The CCM model is equivalent to
a system of L agents with λi = i/L. In this case, strictly
q = 1 − 1/L and thus C = ¯E/ ln(L).

For comparison, we have performed numerical simu-
lation in a ensemble of N = 104 systems, each having
L = 104 agents. The saving propensity are chosen from
a uniform distribution in the interval (0, 1) and are or-
dered in all the systems such that λ0 ≤ λ1 ≤ . . . λL−1.
Initial wealth is also chosen randomly in each system with
ﬁxed ¯E. Thus the stating wealth of any particular agent
is diﬀerent in diﬀerent systems. Average wealth of each

agent, wi is calculated after 103 MCS and then the distri-
bution P (w) is evaluated. Fig. 1 compares w and P (w)
with exact results.

The results discussed in Eq.

(10) is valid for any
q << 1, where one expects P (w) = C/w2. However
earlier numerical studies [4] have reported a power law
distribution only for large q. One can explain the dis-
crepency as follows. The minimum wealth of the system
is w(0) = qC and the maximum is w(1) = qC/(1 − q2).
The width of the interval q3C/(1 − q2) is quite small for
small q unless C is large. Since C is proportional to ¯E one
must take large average wealth to see such a power-law.
Beacause of the ﬁnite lower limit in w, the cumulative
distribution P (w > m) = 1 − q−1 + C/n shows a power
law up to a constant. We have plotted P (w > m)+q−1−1
versus n in log scale in Fig. 2 which perfectly ﬁts to C/n
(see ﬁgure caption for details).

It is interesting to ask what happens when two diﬀer-
ent economies interact? For example take a system of L
agents, of which q and 1 − q fractions belongs to two dif-
ferent organizations σ = ±. Their saving propensity dis-
tributed according to gσ(λ) respectively with 0 < λ < 1.
During trading agent i of type σ interacts with agent j
(type σ′) and share ǫij (σ, σ′) and 1 − ǫij(σ, σ′) fraction
of the ’the available wealth’ respectively. Let us assume
that hǫij(σ, σ′)i = rσσ′ (obviously r+− = r−+). The dis-
tribution of the grand system is now

g(λ) = qg+(λ) + pg−(λ).

and the eﬀective sharing is r = q2r++ + (1 − q)2r−− +
2q(1 − q)r+−. No matter what the value of r is Eq. (6)
is still valid and thus the distribution of wealth is given
by Eq. (8). So the powerlaw P (w) ∼ w−2 and even Eq.
(6) are quite robust.

Eq. (6) is the central result of this article, which states
that wealth of an agent having saving propensity λ is in-
versely proportional to 1 − λ, irrespective of what the dis-
tribution g(λ) and h(ǫ) are. It clearly indicates that on
the average each agent, independent of how rich or poor
he is, invests a constant wealth C (which is of course
(1 − λ fraction of his individual wealth) for trading [10].
And then with equal probability he receives r or 1 − r
fraction of the available wealth (2C). On the average,
thus the individual wealth is preserved in steady state.

One can instead write Eq. (6) as

w(λ) =

C
1 − λ

thus, better saving means better wealth. To verify the
robustness of Eq.
(11) let us divide the system of L
agents with their saving distributed uniformly in (0, q)
into two groups ; (a) the poor savers who have λi < z
and (b) the rich savers who have z ≤ λ < q.
If the
poor savers interact only with the poor and rich interacts
only with the rich, clearly the system breaks up into two
independent sub-systems of size zL and (q − z)L respec-
tively. Corresponding wealth for the poor and the rich
are wp(λ) = Cp/(1 − λ) and wr(λ) = Cr/(1 − λ), where
Cp and Cr are to be determined independently from the
initial average of wealth in each system. The total distri-
bution of wealth is P (w) = zPp(w) + (q − z)Pr(w), where
the distribution for the poor and the rich are Pr,p(w) =
Cr,p/w2, nonzero in the interval wp(0) < w < wp(z)
and wr(z) < w < wp(1) respectively. Depending on the
choice of parameters one can get diﬀerent intervals where
Pp, Pr , both or none of them contributes to P (w). For
certain choice, as described in the inset of Fig. 3, it is pos-
sible to obtain a cumulative wealth distribution which re-
sembles the one observed in reality. Corresponding poor-

rich break up at λ = 0.4 is shown in Fig. 3(a). This
discontinuity disappears once some intermediate savers
(whose saving propensities are limited to z < λi < b)
are introduced who can intercat with both the poor and
the rich savers. Surprisingly w(λ) and P (w) in this sys-
tem are identical to the original CCM model where every
agent interacts with every other agent. Fig. 3(b) com-
pares w(x) obtained from from numerical simulation for
poor-intermediate-rich system with the exact results. It
is thus suggestive that each agent in the system stands
by their own. Irrespective of their distribution of saving
propensity and interaction with other agents, any tagged
agent who has saving propensity λ acquires wealth which
is inversely proportional to (1− λ). Eq. (11) is thus quite
robust.

Until now we have discussed about the distribution of
wealth in a ensemble of inﬁnitely many identical systems.
Instead, if we look at any given system which is a member
of the ensemble, wealth of any particular agent (saving
propensity λ) would show ﬂuctuations about the average
w = C/(1 − λ). Such ﬂuctuations have been studied by
Manna and co-authors in [11]. Their numerical studies
indicate that the distribution of ﬂuctuations P (E) for
any tagged agent (saving propensity λ) is a Gamma-like
distribution which is asymmetric about the mean w =
C/(1 − λ) and is peaked at Ec < w. It is also known that
the distribution becomes symmetric with Ec approaching
w when λ → 1. Since usually agents are crowded around
the peak of the distribution, in any particular system
in the ensemble P (E) is not very diﬀerent from P (Ec).
Thus for the ”rich” (who has λ ≈ 1), the distribution
of wealth P (E) is same as P (w) (as Ec ≈ w), which
explains the Pareto-law for the rich in every system in a
ensemble [12]. Whereas deviation of P (E) from a power-
law is expected for the poor. Exact study of ﬂuctuations
could reveal the discripency.

What happens in a system of identical agents (each
agent in the system have same saving propensity λ)?
Note that, we need not consider identical copies of the
systems now. The system itself is an ensemble of identical
agents. Clearly the average wealth is w = C/(1 − λ) = ¯E
and thus the probability distribution P (w) = δ(w − ¯E).
Agents in the system diﬀer by their ﬂuctuations and thus
the distribution of wealth at any given instant would only
count the ﬂuctuations about the average ¯E, which is not
diﬀerent from the distribution of ﬂuctuations of a tagged
agent in CCM model. Extensive numerical simulations[4]
have shown a Gamma-like distribution in this case. Fur-
ther analytic study might shed light on the exact form of
distribution.

In conclusion, we have provided an exact solution
to the ideal-gas like markets using Gibbs ensemble ap-
proach. We point out that in a system of non-identical
agents, it is appropriate to consider inﬁnitely many iden-
tical copies of the systems diﬀering by their initial con-
ditions. Such ensembles represents evolution of several
identical systems under same macroscopic conditions and
thus physical observables makes sense only as an ensem-
ble averaged quantity. A real single system,
instead,
would encounter ﬂuctuations which are sometimes incal-
culably complex. A system of agents having the same
saving propensity is such a case, where average quanti-
ties like wealth is identical for every agent and ﬂuctua-
tions are the only thing which counts. The central result
revealed from our exact solution is that in ideal-gas like
markets, irrespective of the details of the interaction and
distribution of saving propensity, an agent having saving
propensity λ would on the average acquire wealth which
is inversely proportional to 1 − λ, i.e. better savers are
richer. Thus every agent, poor ( small λ) or rich (large
λ), on the average invests the same amount for trading,
contrary to real economy where ”rich” usually invests
more. To account such scenario one might modify this
minimal model so that the investment is non-linear in w
(note that current investment (1 − λ)w is linear).

Our exact result provides essential understanding of
the model, explains and summarizes several numerical
studies done over years after it is introduced. We also
points out certain essential features of economy which
can not be realized in the minimal model and suggest
possible modiﬁcations.

Abstract

The dynamics of opinion formation in large groups of people is a complex non-linear phenomenon

whose investigation is just at the beginning. Both collective behaviour and personal view play

an important role in this mechanism.

In the present work we mimic the dynamics of opinion

formation of a group of agents, represented by two state ±1, as a stochastic response of each of

them to the opinion of his/her neighbours in the social network and to feedback from the average

opinion of the whole. In the light of recent studies, a scale-free Barab´asi-Albert network has been

selected to simulate the topology of the interactions. A turbulent-like dynamics, characterized by

an intermittent behaviour, is observed for a certain range of the model parameters. The problem of

uncertainty in decision taking is also addressed both from a topological point of view, using random

and targeted removal of agents from the network, and by implementing a three state model, where

the third state, zero, is related to the information available to each agent. Finally, the results of

the model are tested against the best known network of social interactions: the stock market. A

time series of daily closures of the Dow Jones index has been used as an indicator of the possible

applicability of our model in the ﬁnancial context. Good qualitative agreement is found.

INTRODUCTION

Systems composed of many parts that interact with each other in a non-trivial way are

often referred to as complex systems. The social relations between individuals can perhaps

be included in this category. An intriguing issue concerns the role played by the topological

structure of the social network in governing the dynamical behaviour of the system.

Recent studies of the topological proprieties of interactions in diﬀerent biological, social

and technological systems has made it possible to shed some light on the basic principles

of structural self-organization. A few examples include the food webs [1], power grids and

neural networks [2, 3], cellular networks [4], sexual contacts [5], Internet routers [6], the

World Wide Web [7], actor collaborations [2, 3, 8, 9], the citation networks of scientists [10]

and the stock market [11]. Although diﬀerent in the underlying interaction dynamics or

micro-physics, all these networks have shown a tendency to self-organize in structures that

share common features. In particular, the number of connections, k, for each element, or
node, of the network follow a power law distribution, P (k) ∼ k−α. Networks that fulﬁll this

property are referred to as scale-free (SF) networks. In addition many of these networks are

characterized by a high clustering coeﬃcient, C, in comparison with random graphs [12].

The clustering coeﬃcient, C, is computed as the average of local clustering, Ci, for the ith

node, deﬁned as

Ci =

2yi
zi(zi − 1)

,

(1)

where zi is the total number of nodes linked to the site i and yi is the total number of links

between those nodes. As a consequence both Ci and C lie in the interval [0,1]. The high

level of clustering found supports the idea that a herding phenomenon is a common feature

in social and biological communities.

Numerical studies on SF networks have demonstrated how the topology plays a funda-

mental role in infection spreading [13] and tolerance against random and preferential node

removal [14]. A detailed description of the progress in this emerging ﬁeld of statistical

mechanics can be found in the recent reviews of Refs. [15, 16].

In the present work we

investigate the implication of a scale-free topology in a stochastic opinion formation model.

Similar versions of this model have been tested in regular lattices [17, 18] and percolation

clusters [19].

In the next section we describe the model used for the simulation. In Sec. III we show the

2

results obtained numerically while in Sec. IV we investigate the importance of failures in the

network during the process of opinion formation. In Sec. V the two state model is extended

to three states and the numerical results are compared. In Sec. VI and VII we test the results

of our simulations against the best known social network: the stock market. In particular

the time series of average opinion ﬂuctuations obtained with the model is compared with

the time series of price variations for the Dow Jones index from 13/1/1930 to 13/4/2004.

The ﬁnal section presents further discussion and conclusions.

II. THE MODEL

In the present work we investigate the opinion formation process of a group of N indi-

viduals, represented by nodes on a SF network. The mechanism of opinion formation is

simulated using stochastic heat bath dynamics with feedback. The opinion of each agent is

of a Boolean type. That is, at each discrete time step, t, the opinion is represented by one of

two possible states (or spin orientations), namely σi(t) = ±1, for the ith agent. A practical

example could be the decision to buy, σi(t) = +1, or sell, σi(t) = −1, a stock in a virtual

stock market.

In order to mimic the scale-free network topology we make use of the Barab´asi-Albert

model [9]. This is based on two main assumption: (i) linear growth and (ii) preferential

attachment. In practice the network is initialized with m0 disconnected nodes. At each step

a new node with m edges is added to the pre-existing network. The probability that an edge

of the new node is linked with the ith node is expressed by Π(ki) = ki/
of this preferential growing process yields a scale free network, P (k) ∼ k−α where α = 3.

It is worth noting that the Barab´asi-Albert model cannot reproduce a high clustering

coeﬃcient. In fact, the value of this coeﬃcient depends on the total number of nodes in the

network [15] and in the thermodynamic limit, N → ∞, C → 0. In principle the observed

local clustering can play an important role in the opinion formation of groups of people,

independent of their total number. In order to account for this, we introduce a further step

in the growth process, namely the triad formation proposed by Holme and Kim [20]. In this

case, if the new added node is linked with an older node, i, having other links, then with

a certain probability, θ, the next link of the new node, if any remain, will be added to a

randomly selected neighbour of node i. This method of introducing friends to friends, while

FIG. 1: Example of scale-free network. The number of nodes is 500 with clustering probability

θ = 0.9 and m0 = m = 2, so that each new node is linked twice. The number of nodes has

been kept small in order to preserve the clarity of the plot. Note that, for such small networks,

a large scale invariant range is obtained only if one considers the ensemble average over several

realizations. This plot has been realized with the Pajek software [21].

preserving the scale-free nature of the networks, generates high clustering coeﬃcients that

do not depend on the number of nodes in the network. The only tunable parameter that

changes the value of the clustering coeﬃcient is the clustering probability θ. An example of

SF network generated with this algorithm is shown in Fig. 1 for 500 nodes.

Once the scale-free network has been built, we randomly assign the spin values, ±1, to

every node and start the simulation of opinion formation. We neglect, in the ﬁrst approxima-

tion, the network dynamics. This is equivalent to assuming that the time scale for evolving

the network is much longer that the time needed for people to make a decision.

The dynamics of the spins follows a stochastic process that mimics the human uncertainty

in decision making [17, 18, 19]. Values are updated synchronously according to a local

probabilistic rule: σi(t + 1) = +1 with probability pi and σi(t + 1) = −1 with probability

1 − pi. The probability pi is determined, by analogy with heat bath dynamics with formal

temperature kbT = 1, by

where the local ﬁeld, Ii(t), is

Ii(t) = aξ(t) ˜Ni

The ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of Eq. (3) represents the time dependent interaction
strengths between the node i and his/her ˜Ni information sources, which are the ﬁrst neigh-

bours in the network. The second term instead reﬂects the personal reaction to the system

feedback, that is the average opinion,

resulting from the previous time step. The terms ξ(t) and ηi(t) are random variables uni-

formly distributed in the interval (-1,1) with no correlation in time nor in the network. They

represent the conviction, at time t, with which agent i responds to his/her group and the

global opinion of the network respectively. The strength term, a, is constant and common

for the whole network, while hi is speciﬁcally chosen for every individual from a uniform

distribution in (0,κ) and are both constant in the dynamics of the system. By varying the pa-

rameter κ we can give more or less weight to the role of feedback in the model. The strength

coeﬃcients a and hi in the local ﬁeld, Ii, characterizing the attributes of the agents, play

a key role in the dynamics of the model. They represent the relative importance that each

agent of the network gives, respectively, to his/her group and to his/her personal intuition.

III. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS

At ﬁrst we investigate the importance of the group strength a by ﬁxing κ = a.

In

this case the dynamical behaviour is similar to that found in the stock market context in
Refs. [17, 18, 19]. For a <

∼ 1 the resulting time series of average opinion is largely uncorrelated

Gaussian noise with no particularly interesting features, as illustrated in Fig. 2(i).

As soon as we exceed the value of a ≈ 1 a turbulent-like regime sets in, characterized by

large intermittent ﬂuctuations, as illustrated in Fig. 2(ii → iv). These large ﬂuctuations,

or coherent events, can be interpreted in terms of a multiplicative stochastic process with a

weak additive noise background [18, 22]. For a > 2.7 we observe that the bursts of the time

series begin to saturate the bounds −1 ≤ r ≤ 1.

nodes, clustering probability θ = 0.9, m0 = m = 5 and we take the upper bound of the distribution

of personal response strengths equal to the group response strength, that is κ = a. The results

involve 10 realizations of the scale free network each displayed for 5000 time steps. For values of

a greater than 1 a turbulent-like state, characterized by large ﬂuctuations, starts to appear in the

process of opinion formation. The clustering probability θ = 0.9, related to the triad formation in

the network, ﬁxes the clustering coeﬃcient to C ≈ 0.39. This value is similar to that found for

many real systems [15, 16].

In Fig. 3 we plot the probability distribution functions (PDFs) Associated with the time

series of Fig. 2. The large ﬂuctuations, for a greater than ≈ 1, are reﬂected in the fat tails

of the relative PDFs. Decreasing the value of a, and so the number of coherent events, the

PDF converges to a Gaussian distribution generated by a random Poissonian process.

The personal response to the change in the average opinion also plays an important role

in the turbulent-like regime of the simulation. In order to study the impact of this term

on the dynamics we change the parameter κ while keeping a ﬁxed at 1.8. The results are

summarized by the PDF plots in Fig. 4. For κ = 0 the behaviour of the time series is still

turbulent-like, underlying how the network group interaction is, in reality, the only crucial

factor for the appearance of coherent events. As expected, incrementing the value of κ leads

to a progressive crossover toward a noise regime. It is important to notice how this regime is

reached for κ > 10a. The group interactions continue to play an important role even when

the average value of hi is large compared to a.

The previous simulations have also been repeated for diﬀerent values of N, θ and m.

While varying the absolute number of agents, N, and the average local clustering, θ, does

not lead to any substantial diﬀerence in the dynamics of the model, the average number of
links per node, ¯k = 2m, has an eﬀect in the turbulent-like phase. An increase in the average

number of links per node gives rise to more turbulence characterized by larger ﬂuctuations

and broader tails in the PDF. Large scale synchronizations are more likely to occur. This

is just another conﬁrmation of the importance of the network group interactions in the

formation of collective opinion.

In the next section we extend our model in order to include indecision in the process of

FIG. 4: The importance of the personal response, related to the parameter κ is shown by the

change of shapes of the PDFs for a = 1.8. For large values of κ the time series of global opinion

approaches Gaussian noise. The time series of r has been normalized – see the caption of Fig. 3.

IV. THE INFLUENCE OF INDECISION

We now extend our model in order to include the concept of indecision. In practice a

certain agent i, at a time step t, may take neither of the two possible decisions, σi = ±1, but

remain in a neutral state. Keeping faith to the spirit of the model, we address this problem

introducing an indecision probability, ǫ: that is the probability to ﬁnd, at each time step,

a certain agent undecided. This is equivalent to introducing time dependent failures in the

structure of the network by setting σ = 0.

Focusing on the turbulent-like regime, the shape of the PDF in the opinion ﬂuctuations

changes according to diﬀerent concentrations of undecided persons. The results of the sim-

ulations, in Fig. 5, show how the dynamics of the model move from an intermittent state

for ǫ = 0 toward a noise state for ǫ ≈ 0.6. The convergence to a Gaussian distribution is ob-

tained only for quite high concentrations of undecided agents at about 60%. The robustness

of the turbulent-like behaviour is related to the intrinsic robustness of SF networks against

random failures [14]. In fact, because of the power law distribution of links per node, the

probability of setting a node to inactive is much higher for the poorly connected ones while

in the simulation are: N = 104, θ = 0.9, m = m0 = 5, a = 1.8 and κ = a.

the “hubs” are relatively “safe”. We can claim that, in large social networks governed by

stochastic reactions in their elements, large ﬂuctuations in the average opinion can appear

even in the case in which a large part of the network is actually “inactive” provided that

the structure is scale free and the indecision is randomly distributed. The existence of large

hubs provides for the survival of extended sub-networks in which synchronization can give

rise to coherent events. The structure of the network itself supplies the random indecision.

Now we address the question of how the dynamics may change if we do not choose

randomly the inactive nodes but we target the nodes having the most links. What we

do in practice is to sort the nodes according to their number of links and then deactivate

the nodes having the largest number of links in decreasing order. Fig. 6 illustrates how

the fragmentation process is much faster and the noise regime is reached already when

only the 10% of the hubs are deactivated. As emphasized in Ref. [14], the hubs have a great

importance in the structural properties of SF networks and speciﬁcally targeting these nodes

can lead to sudden isolation of a large fraction of the nodes of the network.

FIG. 6: In this simulation we progressively turn oﬀ the largest hubs in the network. Once we have

turned oﬀ about the 10% of agents, N = 104, the coherence in opinion formation disappears. The

parameters used in the simulations are the same as in Fig. 5.

V. AGENT INDUCED INDECISION: THE THREE STATE MODEL

In the previous section we introduced random and targeted failures in order to study the

response of the system to changes in the network topology. In a real social network the

reason behind the indecision of a person follows much more complex rules and can depend

on diﬀerent factors as, for example, unsatisfactory information obtained by his/her sources.

As seen from Eq. (3), the opinion of each agent depends on the poll of his/her network links.
Suppose now that the agent i has ˜Ni neighbours where ˜Ni/2 of these share the opinion +1
while the remaining ˜Ni/2 share the opposite opinion. In this case, unless we give speciﬁc

weights to each node, the agent i will not have an easy task in choosing one of the two

possible positions because of a lack of popular consensus. Based on this idea derived from

common sense, we can extend our two state model by introducing an induced indecision

probability, µ, dependent on the information available to the agents at each time step. In

particular we deﬁne the global opinion of the neighbours of the ith node as si(t) =

relevant diﬀerence if compared with the two state model with the same parameters, Fig. 7.

We also plot the PDF for the number of inactive agents, Ns(t), during the simulation,

Fig. 8. It is interesting to notice how this distribution is not Gaussian distributed around the

average but it is skewed on one side. Moreover, only a small fraction of agents is undecided,

of the order of 10/15 %. This is consistent with the observation that in opinion polls most

of the participants actually indicate an opinion.

VI. POSSIBLE APPLICATION: OPINION FORMATION AND THE STOCK

MARKET

The model for opinion formation discussed thus far can be tested against the best known

real social network: the stock market. The main idea is to compare our results with some

stylized facts concerning the price time series, P (t) and, in particular, with the proprieties

of the logarithm of the price ﬂuctuations, or returns, R(t) = ln P (t + 1) − ln P (t). In fact

some characteristic features are independent of the particular market and can be considered

as universal [23]. Moreover the returns show an intermittent behaviour, reminiscent of

hydrodynamic turbulence [23, 24, 25, 26], also characterized by power law tails in the PDF.

In this case the large coherent events are related to crashes or other anomalous variations

of price.

and supply,

If we assume that the variation of price is directly proportional to changes in demand

dP
dt

∝ cp P,

(6)

where cp is proportional to the average opinion, r(t), then the returns are proportional to

the average opinion R(t) ≈ r(t). Using this assumption, we compare the time series of

average opinion generated by the two states model against the time series of daily closures

of the Dow Jones index. The data set spans the range 13/1/1930 to 13/4/2004 for a total

of 18645 samples. In Fig. 9, a comparison between the two PDFs is shown. The similarities

between the model and the Dow Jones is remarkable. Both distributions have a leptokurtic

shape and, in particular, they are described by power law tails, expressing the turbulent-like

13

dynamics of the time series∗.

The similarities between the artiﬁcial time series generated by the virtual social network

and the stock market extend beyond the fat tails in of PDF of the ﬂuctuations to temporal

correlations. It is well known that the stock market returns have negligible correlations on

daily intervals while the volatility, ν, deﬁned as their absolute value, have a slow power law

decrease as a function of the time lag. This phenomenon is known as volatility clustering [23].

In order to make a comparison with our model we make use of the autocorrelation function,

ρ. For a time series of L samples, xi for i = 1, ..., L, this is deﬁned as

ρ(τ ) = P

L−τ
j=1 (xj − ¯x)(xj+τ − ¯x)
L−τ
j=1 (xj − ¯x)2

,

P

(7)

where τ is a time delay and ¯x represents the average over the period under consideration.

The autocorrelation has been computed both for the returns and for the volatility. While the

time series of returns generated by the model and the Dow Jones index have an equivalent

behaviour, Fig. 10 (top), the same similarities do not hold for the volatility, Fig. 10 (bottom).

We observe a qualitatively diﬀerent correlation: while for the market we observe a power law

behaviour, the memory in the time series generated by the model decays exponentially like a

short-range correlated random processes [23]. This second point illustrates how non-trivial

memory eﬀects in the stock market cannot be taken into account by a simple heath bath

dynamics.

In Fig. 10 (bottom) we also reproduce the autocorrelation function for the model pre-

sented in Ref. [19]. In that case the decay is much closer to that of the real market. At this

point it is important to underline that the main diﬀerence between the two models is related

to the network dynamics. While in the present simulation the network is ﬁxed, in Ref. [19]

the interaction between agents are time dependent and localized in separate clusters. We

can argue that the dynamics of the networks and, in particular, the clustering of agents in

diﬀerent sub-networks can play an important role in the correlation properties of the stock

market volatility. In reality, this fact appears quite natural if we use the autocorrelation

function, deﬁned in Eq. (7), in order to estimate the degree of memory in a process.

If,

for example, the variable under investigation is the sum over many independent Markovian

∗ The problem of the actual shape of the PDF for the stock market returns is still a matter of debate in
the econophysics community [23, 27]. A solution to this problem would be of a great interest, especially
for the practical application of option pricing.

According to the shape of this distribution, the observed macroscopic variable can show a

behaviour characteristic of a long memory processes, like the 1/f Fourier spectrum [28].
Power law tails in the probability distribution function, ρ(τ ) = τ −γ, are produced from
the distribution g(β) = Γ(γ)−1βγ−1, where Γ is the gamma function and γ a generic real

exponent [29]. This fact strengthens the idea that the stock market is organized in a hierarchy

of sub-networks where each of them can be considered, from a physical point of view, at

local equilibrium. For time periods shorter than the typical time scale necessary for the

networks to evolve, the only link between the sub-systems composing the market is the

feedback coming from the price history. This idea is very closely related to the concept of

superstatistics proposed by Beck [30] in the context of hydrodynamic turbulence and then

extended also to other systems [31], the stock market included [32].

VII. MULTIFRACTAL ANALYSIS

Financial time series present an inherent multifractality [33]. In the past few years the

work of many authors [19, 34, 35, 36, 37] has been addressed to the characterization of

the multifractal properties of ﬁnancial time series, and nowadays multifractality can be

considered as a stylized fact. In order to study the multifractal properties of our model we

use the generalized Hurst exponent [38], H(q), derived via the q−order structure function,

Sq(τ ) = h|x(t + τ ) − x(t)|qiT ∝ τ qH(q),

(9)

where x(t) is a stochastic variable over a time interval T and the time delay, τ . The

generalized Hurst exponent, deﬁned in Eq. (9), is an extension of the Hurst exponent,

H, introduced in the context of reservoir control on the Nile river dam project, around

1907 [33, 39]. This technique provides a sensitive method for revealing long-term correlations

in random processes. If H(q) = H for every q, the process is said to be monofractal and

H is equivalent to the original deﬁnition of the Hurst exponent. This is the case of simple

Brownian motion or fractional Brownian motion.

If the spectrum of H(q) is not constant with q the process is said to be multifractal. From

the deﬁnition (9) it is easy to see that the function H(1) is related to the scaling properties

of the volatility. By analogy with the classical Hurst analysis, a phenomenon is said to be

persistent if H(1) > 1/2 and antipersistent if H(1) < 1/2. For uncorrelated increments, as

in Brownian motion, H(1) = 1/2. In Fig. 11 a comparison is shown between the multifractal

spectra of the model and the Dow Jones index obtained from the price time series. It is

clear that both processes have a multifractal structure and the price ﬂuctuations cannot be

associated with a simple random walk as in the classical eﬃcient market hypothesis [40].

VIII. DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS

In the present work we have introduced a two state model of opinion in order to simulate

the complex dynamics of opinion formation in a group of individuals. The decision updating

is governed by a stochastic heat-bath dynamics that mimics the reaction of each person to

his/her speciﬁc sources of information as governed by the network neighbours and to the

average opinion of the whole group. Particular emphasis has been given to the topology

of the interactions between agents, where a Barab´asi-Albert SF network has been used to

simulate the links between them. The choice of this particular network is motivated by a

series of recent studies on social aggregation [15, 16]. As in other studies [17, 18, 19], we

ﬁnd a range in the parameter space in which the ﬂuctuations of opinion have a non-trivial

turbulent-like dynamics. The results of the simulations show that the most important factor

determining the appearance of large ﬂuctuations, is the synchronization of large parts of the

network. As discussed in Sec. III, this feature plays an important role even in the case in

which the personal opinion is relatively strong. As a consequence large coherent events are

more likely to occur when the average number of links per agent is larger.

The topology of the interactions also plays a key part in the dynamics of the model.

In fact, introducing inactive agents and spreading the undecided agents randomly on the

network, does not spoil the turbulent-like state even for high concentrations of “gaps”, up to

approximately 60% of agents. This is a consequence of the implicit robustness of SF networks

against random failures. If instead of selecting randomly the undecided individuals we aim

directly to the “hubs” of the network then the situation changes. In this case the network

is disaggregate, composed of very small sub-networks and isolated nodes. Synchronization

cannot signiﬁcantly eﬀect the resulting global opinion and the time series approximates

17

Gaussian noise. We also introduce, in Sec. V, a three state model. While the dynamics

does not signiﬁcantly diﬀer from the two state model, we ﬁnd a persistence of opinion with

a sharp upper limit in the number of undecided agents. In Sec. VI we test the results of

the simulations against a time series of daily closures for the Dow Jones index. The stock

market, in fact, can be considered as the most studied network of social interactions. The

results show a very good agreement with some stylized facts of the ﬁnancial market like the

broad tails in the PDFs, temporal correlations and a multifractal spectrum. We also notice

an interesting discrepancy in the autocorrelation function for the volatility. Comparing the

present results with those obtained in Ref. [19], we conjecture that the persistence in the

volatility memory can be explained by considering the market as constituted by sub-systems

at local equilibrium and weakly interacting with each other. It will be interesting to explore

this conjecture in a quantitative manner in a further investigation.

Time-evolving distribution of time lags

between commercial airline disasters

Abstract

We have studied the time lags between commercial line airplane disasters and their

occurrence frequency till 2002, as obtained from a freely available website. We show

that the time lags seem to be well described by Poisson random events, where

the average events rate is itself a function of time, i.e. time-dependent Poisson

events. This is likely due to the unsteady growth of the industry. The time lag

distribution is compared with a truncated Tsallis distribution, thereby showing that

the ”phenomenon” has similarities with a Brownian particle with time dependent

mass. We distinguish between ”other causes” (or natural causes) and ”terrorism

acts”, the latter amounts to about 5 percents, but we ﬁnd no drastic diﬀerence nor

impact due to the latter on the overall distribution.

1 Introduction

One modern question in statistical mechanics pertains to the extreme events

and subsequent risk of avoidance. The distribution of events is described by

various event probability distribution functions (PDF). No need to recall that

the tails of the PDF are carefully examined in many ﬁelds of science, politics,

psychology, economy ... For very large numbers of observations, due to the

central limit theorem, the Gaussian law is the theoretically expected one. The

log normal distribution is very similar to the Gaussian(1), and is better used

when experiments can be often repeated.

The Poisson distribution was introduced for describing the number of deaths

n during a given time interval by horse kicking (in the Prussian army) (1),

and is well-known to prevail for independent and rare events (2). In general,

it reads

P (n|a) =

an
n!

e−a,

(1)

(2)

where n is the number of events occurring during some time interval, and a is

the arithmetic average of n. It is well-known that the waiting times between

two successive Poisson events distribute like a negative exponential:

−1
f (τ ) = τ
c

exp (−τ /τc).

where τC is the average characteristic waiting time between events. Amongst

others, these statistics have been used for describing nuclear desintegration,

i.e. the frequency of nuclear events occurred in time intervals given by the

Poisson function, but also for the time lags between shoppers entering a store,

2

the number of phone calls in a time interval, the number of failure of products

in a time interval, and also for spatial interval distributions like the fall of

meteorites on land (1).

Do plane accidents or more speciﬁcally plane crashes enter this category of

independent critical events? It seems that this simple question has not been

much studied up to now, thereby requiring the characterisation of the time

separation between (or frequency of) such crashes. Yet recent events seem to

suggest such an investigation, i.e. recall the case of 5 major crashes in August

2005, when this paper was being completed/reviewed. One may also won-

der whether speciﬁc external ﬁelds inﬂuence the distribution of plane crashes.

Disregarding the time of classical wars, one is aware that so called terror-

ists attempted to satisfy some psychological and other conditions by putting

bombs in planes and exploding them. One may question whether the time

distribution between plane crashes depends on such acts. The more so at this

time of so-called war.

One could argue that plane accident should be separated between those having

led to human casualties and others without casualties (3; 4). The deﬁnition

of the plane is also relevant: airplane, helicopters, gliders, dirigibles, ULM,

.... One could demand some data analysis on commercial airplanes, as well

as about chartered, private or military ones. These are hard to obtain. The

various causes of accidents might be distinguished, - when furnished by the

inquiry conclusions. Recall for instance the Lauda Air plane explosion over

Thailand on May 26, 1991 (223 deaths), ﬁrst thought to be a terrorist act which

targeted the wrong plane/ﬂight, but the disaster was 4 years later attributed

to electromagnetic interference, from a camcorder, laptop computer or mobile

phone, with the plane electronic equipment (5).

In order to perform this time lag analysis, we have examined a freely available

data set of airplane disasters, involving commercial passengers, from the point

of view of time intervals between such events, but also examining whether

criminal acts inﬂuence the distribution, when the voluntarily brutal destruc-

tion of the carrier is acknowledged and recognized as such. In so doing we some-

what examine endogenous and exogenous cases (6; 7) of disaster, - the exoge-

neous cause being here quite speciﬁed. Let it be known at once that this ”sab-

otage” (in a broad sense) amounts to only about 0.05 to 0.08 of disasters (be-

tween 1950 and 2004), according to http : //www.planecrashinf o.com/cause.htm

(4).

A priori one might imagine that plane crashes are independent events. How-

ever media discuss the occurrence of series, or avalanches, - as in Aug. 2005.

What are the characteristics of such series? Are they existing? Do they result

from endogenous or exogenous causes, or are the series mere illusions? Corre-

4

lations with cosmic or geophysical activity might be considered. This suggests

to examine data through time ﬁlters, like done for ﬁnancial indices, sometimes

attempting to forecast ﬁnancial crashes, and correlate the data to other time

series. In this ﬁrst paper, we will not attempt to correlate the data on the

examined crashes with any natural cause. Apparently there are more disasters

during the Northern Hemisphere fall-winter time with a high peak occurring

in December (Fig. 1).

An interesting fundamental question is nevertheless of great interest. The usual

distribution functions are measured for systems in which several quantities are

constrained through conservation laws. It is quite clear that the number of air-

planes and ﬂights have increased through the last century. It is of interest to

observe whether such an evolution inﬂuences the expected Poisson distribu-

tion. Considering that the number of planes is not conserved, and a plane is

a ”particle”, one might admit that the system is out of equilibrium. Whence

characteristic distribution functions for such systems might be considered, like

the Tsallis one (8; 9); we will do so.

A ﬁnal warning is necessary, like in many not reproducible (oﬀ-laboratory)

experiments, the data set completeness, accuracy, whence validity can be ques-

tioned. We have taken data e-published by http://dnausers.d-n-a.net/dnetGOjg/

Disasters.htm (10). The data set gives the date of the crash together with some

reason for the latter, and the number of deaths, beside the type of plane or

airline. We have examined the data in order to remove spurious events during

the numerical analysis, e.g. a collision between two airplanes is only consid-

ered as one single event. Sometimes the data table mentions mid air collision,

but mentions only one plane. We cannot guarantee that all crashes have been

recorded on this website. It is therefore expected that our study will lead

5

to further investigations which with better data informations might lead to

diﬀerent results and conclusions.

In sect. 2, we analyse the data obtained from a web site. We show that the

airline crash distribution is not Poisson-like, Eq.(1), and equivalently that the

time lag distribution exhibits strong deviations from the negative exponential

Eq.(2). Due to the small amount of data, we focus on this time lag distribution

and introduce a risk function in order to study the features of the distribution

tail. By doing so, we ﬁnd that crash statistics are characterised by a time-

dependent exponential distribution function, and seem to be well-described

by a Tsallis distribution. Let us also stress that the mechanisms leading to

the anomalous time distribution are very similar to those occurring in the case

of a Brownian particle with a ﬂuctuating mass (11). In sect. 3, we single out

the few disasters considered to have resulted from criminal acts. We ﬁnd quasi

exactly the same characteristics as in the ”natural cause” cases. Sect. 4 serves

as a brief conclusion.

2 Data Analysis

Data for aircraft crashes with announced 150 or more deaths, and a few others,

are available between 1921 and 2004 on http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A00014

49.html (12). Another web site http://www.scaruﬃ.com/politics/aircrash.html

is supposed to contain a list of airplane accidents that caused 50 victims

or more between 1946 and 2005 (13). A third website http://dnausers.d-n-

a.net/dnetGOjg/ Disasters.htm covers the interval time : Dec. 14, 1920 - March

22, 2002, and seems to be one giving the information on commercial airplanes

only (10). See also http : //www.planecrashinf o.com/cause.htm for a list

between the two distributions.

of 2147 accidents from 1950 thru 2004, from P laneCrashInf o.com accident

database (4). Surprisingly the lists are not quite identical even when they

should be expected to be, either on date or on the number of casualties, - or

on causes. The variations appear at ﬁrst sight to be mild in a statistical sense,

whence would likely not seriously damage the conclusions of the present anal-

ysis. We have chosen to analyze the data extracted from http://dnausers.d-n-

a.net/dnetGOjg/Disasters.htm over the interval time [Dec. 14, 1920 - March

22, 2002], i.e. an interval of 29 344 days during which there were 841 crashes

(10).

In order to characterise the time lags τ between two consecutive crashes, we

ﬁrst focus on the average time lags τA =< τ >∼ 35 days, so that the average

frequency of such events is λA = 0.0286 (days−1) ≡ τ −1

A . A more complete

7

description of the time intervals requires the study of the following rescaled
moments mi = <τ i>
<τ >i − Mi, where Mi is the value of <τ i>

<τ >i calculated for the

exponential distribution τ −1

A exp(−τ /τA). It is straightforward to show that

Mi = i!. Let us note that these quantities measure deviations from the the-

oretical distribution, and have a signiﬁcance similar to that of the kurtosis

and skewness for comparison with Gaussian statistics on the whole real axis

[−∞, ∞]. Indeed, positive values of mi indicate a fat tail of the distribution

(as compared to the exponential), while negative values correspond to under-

populated tails. Our empirical results give the following ﬁrst moments:

m1 = 0
m2 = 3.12
m3 = 57.56

(3)

(4)

where the ﬁrst moment vanishes by deﬁnition. The higher moments imply

that the time lag distribution exhibits an overpopulated tail, i.e. emphasizing

”rather long” times between events. This suggests that commercial airline

crashes are not distributed in a usual Poisson way. This feature is veriﬁed by

comparing a histogram of the number of times there are n crashes in a given

year, withe ”equivalent” Poisson distribution, as shown in Fig.2.

Given the lack of available data, let us now consider the probability f (τ ) for

waiting times in more detail, and let us examine the cumulated distribution

P (t):

P (t) =

f (τ )dτ.

t

Z
0

By construction, this function converges toward 1. In order to study the

asymptotic relaxation of Eq.(4), it is convenient to focus on the risk func-

8

tion

G(t) = 1 − P (t).

(5)

(6)

(7)

(8)

Let us note that G(t) converges to zero for t → ∞ in a related way as the

time distribution f (τ ) does:

G(t) ∼ exp(−µt) ⇔ f (τ ) ∼ exp(−µτ )

G(t) ∼ t−α ⇔ f (τ ) ∼ τ −(α+1).

The empirical risk function is plotted in Fig.(3) together with the correspond-

ing exponential distribution f (τ ) = λA exp(−λAτ ), on (a) semi-log, and (b)

log-log scales.

Obviously, the collected data and the average relaxation diﬀer from each other.

However, for small times, the relaxation appears to be an exponential. We

obtain the relaxation coeﬃcient through a ﬁt over 15 days (Fig.(3(a)) with:

G(t) = e−λinitt , λinit = 0.04 , τinit = 25(days)

where τinit = 1/λinit is the relaxation time for small time lags. It is also

important to note, in the log-log scale, (Fig.(3(b)), the power-law regime in

the interval [30 : 300], that we ﬁt with:

G(t) ∼ t−αm , αm = 1.3.

Such a behaviour, i.e. exponential for small values and power-law for large val-

ues, is compatible with a Tsallis distribution for the waiting times fT sallis(t) =

tαm
T αm(tT + t)−(αm+1), where tT is a positive parameter that smoothens the be-

haviour at short times, and (αm + 1) is the exponent of the power-law tail of

form at the level of the risk function:

GT sallis(t) = tαm

T (tT + t)−αm.

(9)

In ﬁgure (4), we verify that Eq.(9) ﬁts very well the data up to 350 days,

with tT = 12 and αm = 1.3. For larger times τ > 400, in contrast, the

power-law regime and the Tsallis relaxation behaviour clearly cease to be true:

there is a rapid deceleration that we associate with an exponential truncation,

- . There is no reason that a time interval would be inﬁnite indeed. This

behaviour reminds us of the results obtained for the velocity distribution of

a Brownian particle with a ﬂuctuating mass (11); the mass of the particle

being here analogous to the number of planes at a given time. As so observed

we can describe the time interval statistics within such a formal idea, i.e. the

11

Fig. 5. Procedure in order to extract the time dependence of τc. In the crash time

scale, we get τc1 = 50.6 and τc2 = 19.26, that veriﬁes 1

2 (τc1 + τc2) = τA ∼ 35. In the

natural time scale, however, we get τc1 = 101.88, τc2 = 21.08 and 1

2 (τc1 + τc2) 6= τA.

system is characterized by a distribution with a varying characteristic time τc

or relaxation coeﬃcient λc.

In order to show the time dependence of the varying characteristic time τc, we

apply the procedure explained in Fig. 5. It consists in dividing the signal into

windows, and to measure τc locally in time. Two options are possible: either

divide the system into windows of equal time intervals or have time bins with

an equal number of crashes. The choice corresponds to measuring the time

in usual (or natural) units (days), or in ”number of disasters” respectively.

Let us stress that these two possible descriptions also take place in describing

granular gases (14), where one may measure time in seconds, or in number of

collisions, depending on the purpose. Such a choice also occurs when discussing

whether power laws exist in ﬁnancial data (15). Here below, we prefer to apply

the second approach, namely we count time in ”number of disasters” ND, and

we divide the data in Ki intervals encompassing the same number of collision

C, each of the intervals being characterised by a local characteristic time τci.

Recall that the analogous thermodynamic system is considered to be out-

of-equilibrium with a non conserved sort of mass, i.e. the number of planes

or ﬂights. It can be easily noticed that the number of disasters increases with

time, - roughly following a linear law (Fig. 6); a best least square ﬁt (R ≃ 0.87)

gives a slope ∼ 0.3 (year−1). This is likely to be understood as being related

to the steady increase in the number of ﬂights and/or passengers. Indeed

quoting (3) (http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline#Development of air-

lines post-1945) : ”The demand for air travel services is derived demand. ...

Notwithstanding (these) demand patterns, the overall trend of demand has

been consistently increasing. In the 1950’s and 1960’s, annual growth rates of

0.15 or more were common. Annual growth of 0.05-0.06 persisted through the

1980’s and 1990’s.” However we have not been able to ﬁnd the true meaning

14

of these growth rates. It would be interesting to know the true growth rate

of passenger ﬂights and compare it to the here above empirical slope value.

This might point (or not) to recent considerations on ”black list” or not of

airline traﬃc and accidents. Notice that a measure of deaths through airplane

crash probability per ﬂight is known to be 1/25000, according to standard

insurance practice. However http : //www.planecrashinf o.com/cause.htm

pretends that the odds of being killed in a single trip is 1/73187 if only data

from NTSB Accidents and Accident Rates by NTSB Classiﬁcation (4) between

1995 and 2004 is taken into account.

Finally, let us stress that the chosen procedure, i.e. measuring time in number

of disasters, seems the best to take into account this ”growth trend” in the

data analysis. Indeed, the method allows to preserve the average time lag

between these (see Fig.5):

1
Ki

Ki

Xi

τci = τA

(10)

where the sum is performed over all intervals Ki. This property is not veriﬁed

by using the natural time scale. For a lengthier discussion on the deﬁnition of

time, calendar time or business time (in foreign exchange markets), in view of

modeling the dynamics and searching for (scaling) laws see (15).

In ﬁgure 7, we plot the time evolution of τc, by dividing the system into

windows of 20 disasters. Empirical results clearly exhibit the time dependence

of τc, i.e. τc has decreased by a factor 10 over the last century. This conﬁrms

the increase of traﬃc, ∼ increase of mass, during that time period.

Let us now assume that the waiting times in each window are exponentially

15

distributed

fi(τ ) = τ −1

ci exp (−τ /τci).

(11)

(12)

(13)

Consequently, the average distribution for waiting times is

f (τ ) =

τ −1
ci exp (−τ /τci).

1
Ki

Ki

Xi

In the long time limit, this distribution is controlled by the largest value of

τci. In our example, i.e. division into windows of 20 disasters, it is τc1 = 298

days−1. This means that the tail of the distribution is made of events occurring

in the beginning of the XX century, when airline disasters were ... rare events

f (τ ) → exp (−τ /τc1)

Indeed, at the beginning of the XX century there was one crash per year

approximatively, while there is approximately two such disastrous events per

month nowadays (see Fig.6)

We verify that these formulae describe successfully the empirical data in ﬁgure

8, thereby showing that airline disasters are well-described by a time depen-

dent process. The success of the method also enlightens the important role

of the non-stationarity of a random variable in the emergence of anomalous

distributions, and gives a direct application to the abstract formalism devel-

oped in (11). One should also note that this formalism provides an elegant

explanation to the deviations to the Poissonian observed in Fig.2. Indeed, de-

viations for small values of n are due to the very rare events of the beginning

of last century, that enhance the importance of low values of n in the empirical

distribution.

3 Terrorism vs. Other Origin

In order to examine some sort of external ﬁeld eﬀect, i.e. criminal (sometimes

called terrorist) acts on plane accident time lag distribution, we divide the

events into two categories: those considered to have been occurring because

of ”natural” reasons (geophysical cause, human error, ...), and those due to

criminal reasons (so called terrorist attack, hijacking, ...). The selection is

made according to the comments on ”disaster cause column” in the table of

the studied website data. Again some caveat is in order since it is not always

proved or admitted that there is a terrorist act associated with a plane loss.

Neither is it usually admitted that there is a ”military” mistake, like shooting

a missile to a commercial civilian plane, either accidentally or voluntarily

(because the plane ﬂight passes over a military zone). The ”sabotage cause” is

considered to be 8 per cent by http : //www.planecrashinf o.com/cause.htm.

17

By using the comments in the data table, and admitting that the data might

contain some omission or incorrect information, we found 52 criminal crashes

and 789 natural crashes, so that their average time intervals are 564 days

and 37 days respectively. The time sequence of the disasters due to such acts

is shown in Fig. 5. In order to compare the time lag distributions for these

two kinds of events, we have calculated the two corresponding risk functions.

Moreover, we have rescaled their time scale so that their distributions have

the same average τA. Practically, we rescale the time scale of criminal crashes

by a factor 37/564. The resulting risk functions are shown in Fig. 9. Given the

precision of the data, we observe that the time distributions look the same in

the cases of ”natural causes’ and so called ’terrorist acts”. This suggests that

the same time dependent exponential distribution can also be considered as a

best ﬁt to both data.

4 Conclusions

”An aviation accident (as per the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board

deﬁnition) is an occurrence associated with the operation of an aircraft which

takes place between the time any person boards the aircraft with the intention

of ﬂight and all such persons have disembarked, and in which any person

suﬀers death or serious injury, or in which the aircraft receives substantial

damage, while an aviation incident is an occurrence other than an accident,

associated with the operation of an aircraft, which aﬀects or could aﬀect the

safety of operations. Other countries adopt a similar approach, although there

are minor variations, such as to the extent of aviation-related operations on

the ground covered, as well as with respect to the thresholds beyond which an

18

injury is considered serious or the damage is considered substantial” (3).

We have examined the time lag distribution between airplane ﬂown by com-

mercial airline disasters as recorded on a freely available web site. We have

warned about the validity of the data, sometimes due to conditions out of the

responsability of the webmaster. We have examined whether the distributions

diﬀer when so called terrorist (more generally criminal) acts are taken into

account. There seems to be no inﬂuence of any violent act on the total dis-

tribution. We suggest that the distribution be described as a time dependent

exponential distribution function. A connection with a microscopic statistical

physics framework can be found through the Tsallis distribution function, -

since we can consider that the number of airplanes is like the time dependent

mass of a particle undergoing a Brownian motion.

There is no truly ”microscopic” modeling at this time, in view of the lack of

information on possible causes, though it might be interesting to correlate the

crash or disaster to e.g. pilot biorythms, sun spot frequencies, etc., as done in

other cases, like car accidents (16). Other ”internal degrees of freedom” can

be used to distinguish cases. The ”volume” of casualties could also be studied.

Notice that a time dependent Poisson distribution has been found in many

cases : epidemics (17), social studies (18), ﬁnance (19), and even in the air

transportation industry (20) but also for water distribution (21), for coronal

mass ejection (22) and for solar ﬂares waiting times (23), with quite diﬀerent

time scales of course. However it is known that the density of solar ﬂares is

roughly characterized by an eleven year cycle. The recent maxima occurred

in 1969, 1980, 1991 and 2002 (24). Observing that 1972 is the year with the

maximum number of disasters for the examined data, a rapid calculation indi-

cates that the years 1961, 1982, 1994 and 2005 should be close to a maximum

in the number of crash density if an 11-year cycle is postulated. This is the

case indeed. Recall also that the sun has a 27 day rotation period.

(Comment inserted after analysis completion: During the last months that this

report was waiting to be prepared for publication, several disasters occurred,

i.e. Toronto, Palermo, Athens, Machiques, Pucallpa, Singapore, ... apparently

without ist acts. Some follow up of the above work seems of interest.)

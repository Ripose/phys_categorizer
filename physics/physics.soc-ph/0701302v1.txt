Abstract

We consider the scaling behaviors for ﬂuctuations of the number of Korean ﬁrms
bankrupted in the period from August 1 2002 to October 28 2003. We observe a
power law for the distribution of the number of the bankrupted ﬁrms. The Pareto
exponent is close to unity. We also consider the daily increments of the number
of ﬁrms bankrupted. The probability distribution of the daily increments for the
ﬁrms bankrupted follows the Gaussian distribution in central part and has a fat
tail. The tail parts of the probability distribution of the daily increments for the
ﬁrms bankrupted follow a power law.

Zipf law is appeared in many natural and social systems such as the distri-
bution of city sizes, the size of earthquakes, moon craters, solar ﬂares, the
intensity of wars, the frequency of use in any human language, the sales of
books, the number of species in biological taxa[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]. In Zipf law or
Pareto law, the distribution or histogram follows a power law, p(x) ∼ x−(α+1)
where α is a Pareto exponent.

Zipf law has also been reported in economic systems such as the income dis-
tribution of companies, the sales of books and almost every other bounded
commodity, the distribution of bank assets, and the distribution of ﬁrm’s
debt when the company is bankrupted[9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16]. Fujiwara has
reported the Zipf law in ﬁrms bankrupted in Japan. He found a power law,
P (> x) ∼ x−α with α = 0.911(8) for the cumulative distribution of ﬁrm’s
debt[9]. Okuyama and Takayasu reported Zipf law with a Pareto exponent −1
for the income distribution of Japanese companies[10]. Aoyama et al. analyzed

the distribution of income and income tax of individuals in Japan. They ob-
served the power law with the Pareto exponent −2[11]. Ishkawa reported the
income distribution in Japan. He observed Pareto law with the Pareto index
−1 for the income distribution of companies[12].

We observe the power law for the distribution of the number of ﬁrms bankrupted.
The Pareto exponent is close to unity. We also observe the power law for daily
increments of the ﬁrms bankrupted.

We consider the ﬁrms bankrupted in Korea in the period from August 1 2002 to
October 28 2003[17]. The total number of the recorded date are 286 days. We
deleted the weekends and holidays from the time series. We count the number
of daily bankrupted ﬁrms. Let ni be the number of the ﬁrms bankrupted at
date i. Fig. 1 presents the number ni of the ﬁrms bankrupted as a function of
the date i. The time series of the ﬁrms bankrupted show many big peaks. We
can observe that the number of the bankruptcies is increased before the big
crash. The average number of the ﬁrms bankrupted is < ni >= 19.3 and the
standard deviation is σn = 17.8.

Consider the probability distribution p(n) for the number of the ﬁrms bankrupted.
We expect the power law at the large n,

p(n) ∼ n−(α+1).

probability distribution also shows the power law as

P (x > n) ∼ n−α,

where α is a Pareto index.

Fig. 2 presents a log-log plot of the cumulative probability distribution P (x >
n) for the number of the ﬁrms bankrupted. We observe the obvious power law
and obtain the Pareto index α = 0.91(2) by a least-square ﬁt. The number
of the ﬁrms bankrupted shows the Zipf law. This Pareto index is compared
to the Pareto index α = 0.911(8) for the distribution of ﬁrm’s debt when the
ﬁrm was bankrupted in Japan[9].

We also consider increments of the number of ﬁrms bankrupted deﬁned by

r = log ni − log ni−1.

The increments r is similar to the return in the analysis of the ﬁnancial time
series such as stock index[1]. Fig. 3 presents the probability distribution p(r)
for the increments of the number of the ﬁrms bankrupted. The probability
distribution p(r) is well ﬁtted by a Gaussian function in the central parts and
deviates from the Gaussian at the tail parts. However, our observations are
limited results due to the small number of the data sets.

change of the number of the ﬁrms bankrupted versus the return r for the positive
tail(◦) and the negative tail(△). The solid lines are the least-square ﬁt with slopes
−1.69(9), −4.8(8) for the positive tail and −4.1(2) for the negative tail. Inset, the
solid line is a Gaussian ﬁt of the cumulative probability distribution for the positive
tail. The dotted line is an exponential ﬁt p(r) ∼ exp(−αr). The long tail deviates
from the Gaussian function.

P (x > r) as a function of increment r. We observe the power law, P (x >
r) ∼ r−β for the positive and negative tails. For the positive tail we observe
two scaling regions with the slopes β = 1.69(9) and β = 4.8(8). In the inset of

Fig. 4 we observe that the cumulative probability distribution deviates from
the Gaussian ﬁt at large increments. For the negative tail we observe a single
scaling region with the slope β = 4.1(2). The scaling exponents are compared
to the scaling behaviors for the increment of the daily volume in Tokyo stock
exchange. Kaijoji and Nuki reported the exponent β = 0.94 (positive tail) and
β = 1.02 (negative tail) for increments of volume in Tokyo stock exchange[18].

Let’s consider the independence of the successive values ni, ni+1. We change
the variable as yi = ln ni. If the pdf of ni is p(n) ∼ n−(1+α), the pdf of the vari-
able y is given by p(y) ∼ exp(−αy) by the transformation of the probability
distribution. If successive values of n are uncorrelated, i.e. < yiyi+1 >= 0, the
pdf of ri = yi − yi+1 is simply obtained by a convolution. We obtain the pdf
of the varialbe r as p(r) ∼ exp(−αr)/2α. In the inset of Fig. 4 we present the
pdf, p(r) ∼ exp(−αr) with α = 0.91. At the small values of r the data are well
ﬁtted by the exponential distribution function. However, in the large value of
r the data deviate from the exponential distribution. We conclude that there
are long range correlations at the parts of the power-law tail. Long range cor-
relations are an origin of the power-law in the probability distribution of ﬁrms
bankrupted.

Fujiwara propsed a model for the dynamics of balance and sheets of a bank
and ﬁrms[9]. He observed a power law for the probability distribution of
debts bankrupted. However, his model is not involved to the network re-
lations between ﬁrms. Aleksiejuk et al. propsed a model of collective bank
bankruptcies[20]. In their model banks are located on a lattice. Banks with
surpluses tend to invest their money, whereas banks with shortfalls borrow
money from the nearest neighbor bank. Above three dimension the distribu-
tion of avalanches for bank bankrupted follows the power law, p(s) ∼ s−τ with
τ = 1.5 where s is the size of avalanche.

The bankruptcies are a complicated phenomena in economics. Failure of a
ﬁrm is caused by the internal and external factors of the ﬁrms. The eﬀects
of a bankruptcy of a ﬁrm propagate through the network of creditor-debtor.
The creditors are perturbed by the ﬁrm bankrupted. The bankruptcy induces
some chain reactions to the market and economic systems. If the eﬀects of
the bankruptcy are weak, the market absorbs the perturbations and recovers
from the damages. However, if the eﬀects are strong, secondary bankruptcies
are induced. The chain reactions of the bankruptcy are created. The number
of ﬁrms bankrupted in the chain reactions is similar to the number of toppled
sites in avalanche of the sand pile[19]. The herding dynamics is a reason for
the scaling behavior in the bankruptcies.

We consider the scaling properties of the distribution of ﬂuctuations in the
number of ﬁrms bankrupted in Korea. We observe the power law distribution
of the number of ﬁrms bankrupted. The Pareto exponent is close to unity.

5

This Pareto exponent is similar ot Fujiwara’s result for the distribution of
debt of bankrupted ﬁrms. We also observe the power law for increments of the
number of ﬁrms bankrupted. The distribution of increments has the diﬀerent
scaling exponents for positive and negative tail.

The bankruptcy of a ﬁrm inﬂuences to many ﬁrms through creditor-debtor
network. Such avalanche propagates through the creditor-debtor network. The
group dynamics of the ﬁrms induces the self-organized criticality in the bankruptcy.

Abstract. – We introduce a model for the dynamic self-organization of the electric grid. The
model is characterized by a conserved magnitude, energy, that can travel following the links of
the network to satisfy nodes’ load. The load ﬂuctuates in time causing local overloads that drive
the dynamic evolution of the network topology. Our model displays a transition from a fully
connected network to a conﬁguration with a non-trivial topology and where global failures are
suppressed. The most eﬃcient topology is characterized by an exponential degree distribution,
in agreement with the topology of the real electric grid. The model intrinsically presents self-
induced break-down events, which can be thought as representative of real black-outs.

Introduction. – The electric grid is a critical infrastructure for our economy and society.
Recent events, ranging from the large-scale blackouts a few years ago to the California crisis
today [1], highlight the need to enhance the insight on the electric grid, complementing the
traditional technological analysis [2] with new transversal points of view. Our approach is
to study the electric grid macroscopic behavior rather than to dissect individual events. At
that macroscopic scale, the electric grid exhibits behaviors typical of complex systems. For
instance, on the basis of 15-years time series of transmission system black-outs of the U.S.
electric network [3, 4], it has been proposed that the electric grid may be a self-organized
critical system, operating at or near a critical point.

A signature of the electric grid is that it can be represented as a complex network, where
nodes are the generators and the links the transmission lines. Recent research in complex
networks has shown that a detailed knowledge of the topology of a communication or trans-
portation network is essential for the understanding of cascading failures [5–8]. While some of
these studies have focused on the topological robustness of the underlying network to random
failures and targeted attacks [9], other research have considered dynamic processes on static
networks [10, 11]. However, these studies do not consider the network as a dynamic entity
whose evolution is driven by the action of the nodes [12–17].
In this Paper, we present a
dynamic model aiming to describe the growth and evolution of a transportation network. The
network growth relies on the need of resource distribution in a heterogenous environment.

The Model. – We consider N dynamic elements located at the nodes of a two-dimensional
square lattice. Each element i is characterized by its size si, drawn from a probability dis-
tribution p(s). To each element i are associated two dynamic variables: the load (energy
consumption) lt
i . We assume that (i) the load of element
i is described by lt
i represents a ﬂuctuation
term; and (ii) initially at t = 0 the available energy and the constant load at each element are
proportional to its size si

i, and the supply (available energy) f t

i , where mi is a constant value and ξt

i = mi + √miξt

where fr and mr are constant values and in general fr > mr. Starting from an initial condition
where each element is isolated, the network grows as follows. At each time step:

1. If the load overcomes the supply at element i (f t

i < lt

i), a failure occurs.

After a failure, the failing element i chooses a target neighbor through a wiring strat-
egy. Following the empirical results observed in communication networks with spatial
constraints [20], the target node j is chosen such that it maximizes the function

load of each linked element, making next overloads more unlikely.

The choice of the time step for the network construction is a further degree of freedom of our
model. In real electric grids, the time scales of the ﬂuctuating demand are much faster than
the time scales at which the network is modiﬁed. Therefore, we choose to update the network

It is worth noting that at any given time the maximum possible load in the network is λmax =
mrΘ(smax) + √mrΦ(smax). Thus for a system composed by isolated nodes following the same
dynamics, the total energy that guarantees that all the nodes have access to the energy they
need is

εisolated = λmax = mrΘ(smax) + √mrΦ(smax) .

Dynamics of failures. – The transportation network evolves as a consequence of the
overload. As more links are added, sets of nodes will become connected forming clusters
sharing their energy. We introduce the time average of the number of failures per node as
an order parameter of the system. The order parameter shows a transition that depends
on the available energy in the system, fr. For low values of fr, ε < λ, the system evolves
towards a fully connected network in which the total number of failures is of the order of the
system size (Fig. 1a). The total supply in the system is not able to sustain the needs of the
nodes. If ε > λ, a statistically failure free network is formed, accounting for a cooperative
behavior in which the network is able to eﬀectively redistribute the energy throughout the
system. Therefore the condition ε = λ represents a transition point. We remark that, since
the transitions occurs at a value of ε lower than εisolated (see ﬁg.1a, inset), in our model a
dynamic sharing of the resources in a heterogeneous environment is energetically favorable.
However, isolated break–down events (a huge amount of elements fails at once, see Fig. 1b)
are still present in the stable regime. These events represent global cascade failures induced by
local ﬂuctuation, which are ampliﬁed by propagation through the network. Global cascades
are not suppressed, as it is not possible to satisfy the total energy needs. However, as one
furtherly enters the stable regime, global cascades are less likely to occur, representing rare
events that do not prevent the average number of failure to approximate to zero.

We ﬁnd interesting to analyze the transition depending on mr. If mr and fr are inde-
pendent, i.e., the load and the initially available energy at each element are independent, the

transition ε = λ is simply given by fr = mr + 1
2 √mrΦ(smax)/Θ(smax). However, we should
expect that the available energy and the load are related: elements with a high load will also
have large amount of available energy. In this case mr depends on fr accounting for the fact
that the energy availability in each node is meant to supply the local need. If, for simplicity,
[0, 1] the transition is given by

The dynamic network. – A key dynamic ingredient is given by the dynamics of the
network. The evolution of the dynamic network is driven by the failures of the nodes and the
attachment function given by Eq. (3). In the model, failures are induced by local ﬂuctuations
in the load, afterward propagated by the transportation network. During the transient regime,
several failures occur simultaneously leading to the initial development of the network. After
the transient, the network settles to a conﬁguration where the average number of failures
drops to zero. We characterize the emerging topologies in the stationary conﬁgurations. Two
factors determine the network topology: the wiring strategy and the avaliable energy ε. A ﬁrst
characterization of the network topology is given by the degree distribution and the average
shortest path length. By varying the parameters β and γ in the wiring strategy given by
Eq. (3) we obtain diﬀerent classes of networks. In Fig. 2 we show the degree distribution for
three well known topologies exhibited by our system for a ﬁxed value of ε. The ﬁtted curves
individuate a Gaussian degree distribution when the selection of the target element is merely
based on its relative Euclidean distance to the failing element (β = 0 and γ = 1); a power-law
link distribution when the selection of the target element j is based on its size αj (β = 1
and γ = 0); and ﬁnally an exponential degree distribution when the selection of the target
element j is based both on its size αj and relative distance to the failing element (β = 1 and

γ = 3). To analyze the parameter range in which diﬀerent network topologies are observed, we
of the degree distribution for diﬀerent
have measured the normalized standard deviation σ/
parameter values γ
[0, 4], for β = 1. An exponential degree distribution is characterized
by σ/
= 1, while it increases for a power law degree distribution. Figure 3 shows that
exponential degree distributions are obtained for γ > 2.

Increasing the energy above its transition value (ε = λ), the degree distribution remains
qualitatively unchanged. However, a higher number of links is required to stabilize the network
as ε approaches the transition value (Fig. 4). This increment in the total number of links is
due to the higher number of failures that occur during the formation of the network closer to
the transition, as is shown by the cumulative failure histograms in Fig. 4d.

A further topological characterization is given by the average shortest path length l [21]

where δij is the shortest path between the elements i and j.

During the dynamic growth of the network, l decreases from inﬁnity to a stable ﬁnite value.
For a ﬁxed E value, the minimum l is obtained for the network characterized by a power-law
degree distribution (Fig. 5a). However, this does not mean that the network possessing a
power-law degree distribution is the most eﬃcient transporting the energy across the system.
Indeed, a possible measure of the eﬃciency in the energy transport is the following:

Since in our system the largest elements act as energy reservoirs, the deﬁnition of the eﬃciency
η states that the shorter is the path to the larger elements, the more eﬃcient is the network.
Fig. 5b shows that the network possessing an exponential degree distribution is the most
eﬃcient in our model.

Discussion. – In summary we have introduced a model for the dynamic self-organization
of a transportation network, in terms of its growth and evolution. Our model contains several
features which are peculiar of the electric grid. The electric grid is a dynamic network that
evolves based on local needs, failures of local elements, and energy sharing criteria. If the
total energy is below the average consumption, the system reaches a fully connected network;

whereas if the system has enough energy, the emerging network reﬂects the cooperative be-
havior in which the resources are globally shared. When the cooperative behavior is achieved,
the network stops growing and reaches a conﬁguration with a non–trivial topology shaped by
the wiring strategy and the available total energy. Nevertheless, local ﬂuctuations are still
present once the network is formed and keep aﬀecting its functionality. Our model intrin-
sically presents self-induced break-down events, which can be thought as representative of
real black-outs. Another remarkable feature of our model is the heterogeneity in the initial
energy distribution, modeling the geographic inhomogeneity in the energy availability. In a
heterogeneous environment, the dynamic sharing of the resources is energetically favorable.
Heterogeneity also induces the selection of a preferred topology as the most eﬃcient in the
energy transport, because it displays the shortest path to the bigger elements. The most
eﬃcient topology is characterized by an exponential degree distribution, in agreement with
the topology of the real electric grid [22].

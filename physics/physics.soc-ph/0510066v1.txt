Abstract

The asymptotic regime of a complex ecosystem with N random interacting species and in the

presence of an external multiplicative noise is analyzed. We ﬁnd the role of the external noise on

the long time probability distribution of the ith density species, the extinction of species and the

local ﬁeld acting on the ith population. We analyze in detail the transient dynamics of this ﬁeld

and the cavity ﬁeld, which is the ﬁeld acting on the ith species when this is absent. We ﬁnd that the

presence or the absence of some population give diﬀerent asymptotic distributions of these ﬁelds.

INTRODUCTION

In recent years great attention has been devoted to population dynamics modelled by

generalized Lotka-Volterra systems [1]. Ecosystems are a classic example of complex sys-

tems, which became object of study as well by biologists as by physicists [2, 3]. Tools

developed in the context of nonequilibrium statistical physics to analyze nonequilibrium

nonlinear physical systems provide new insights and at the same time new approaches to

the comprehension of the properties of biological and many body systems. A key aspect

to understand the complex behavior of ecosystems is the role of the external noise on the

dynamics of such systems. Noise-induced eﬀects in population dynamics, such as pattern

formation [4, 5], stochastic resonance, noise delayed extinction, quasi periodic oscillations

etc... have been investigated with increasing interest [6, 7, 8, 9]. The dynamical behavior of

ecological systems of interacting species evolves towards the equilibrium states through the

slow process of nonlinear relaxation, which is strongly dependent on the random interaction

between the species, the initial conditions and the random interaction with environment.

The mathematical model here used to analyze the dynamics of N biological species with

spatially homogeneous densities is the generalized Lotka-Volterra system with a Malthus-

Verhulst modelling of the self regulation mechanism and with the addition of an external

multiplicative noise source [10, 11]. We obtain the asymptotic behaviors of the probability

distribution of the populations for diﬀerent values of external noise intensity. To analyze

the role of the external noise on the transient dynamics of the species we focus on the long

time distribution of the local ﬁeld, that is the interaction term in the dynamical equation

of the ith species that takes the inﬂuence of all other species into account. We ﬁnd that

the presence or the absence of some population give diﬀerent asymptotic distributions of

the local ﬁeld and of the cavity ﬁeld (ﬁeld acting on the ith species when this is absent)

in the absence of external noise. When the noise is switched on the asymptotic local and

cavity ﬁelds tend to overlap and approximately superimpose each other for very high noise

intensity. Finally the long time evolution of the average number of the extinct species is

reported for diﬀerent values of the multiplicative noise intensity.

II. THE MODEL

The dynamical evolution of our ecosystem composed by N interacting species in a noisy

environment (climate, disease, etc...) is described by the following generalized Lotka-Volterra

equations with a multiplicative noise, in the framework of Ito stochastic calculus

Eq. (1), α is the growth parameter, the interaction matrix Jij models the interaction between

ecosystem contains 50% of prey-predator interactions (Jij < 0 and Jji > 0), 25% competitive

interactions (Jij > 0 and Jji > 0), and 25% symbiotic interactions (Jij < 0 and Jji < 0).

We consider all species equivalent so that the characteristic parameters of the ecosystem are

independent of the species. The formal solution of Eq. (1) is

The term hi,loc(t) =

the inﬂuence of other species on the diﬀerential growth rate. We note that the dynamical

behavior of the ith population depends on the time integral of the process zi(t) and the time

integral of the local ﬁeld.

In the absence of external noise (ǫ = 0), for a large number of interacting species we can

As a consequence, in the absence of external noise, from the ﬁxed-point equation ni(α

−
ni + hi) = 0, the stationary probability distribution of the populations is the sum of a

truncated Gaussian distribution at ni = 0 (ni > 0 always) and a delta function for extinct

species. The initial values of the populations ni(0) have also Gaussian distribution with

mean value

n(0) = 0.03. The interaction strength J determines
two diﬀerent dynamical behaviors of the ecosystem. Above a critical value Jc = 1.1, the

system is unstable and at least one of the populations diverges. Below Jc the system is stable

and asymptotically reaches an equilibrium state. The equilibrium values of the populations

depend both on their initial values and on the interaction matrix. If we consider a quenched

random interaction matrix, the ecosystem has a great number of equilibrium conﬁgurations,

each one with its attraction basin. For an interaction strength J = 1 and an intrinsic growth

parameter α = 1 we obtain:

In the presence of external noise (ǫ

= 0) we calculate long time probability distribution for

diﬀerent values of the noise intensity. These are shown in the following Fig. 1. For increasing

external noise intensity we obtain a larger probability distribution with a lower maximum

(see the diﬀerent scales in Figs. 1 for diﬀerent noise intensity values). The distribution

becomes asymmetric for ǫ = 0.1 and tends to become a truncated delta function around the

zero value (P (ni) = δ(ni) for ni > 0, and P (ni) = 0 for ni

0), for further increasing noise

intensity. The role of the multiplicative noise is to act as an absorbing barrier at ni = 0 [10].

To conﬁrm this picture we calculate the time evolution of the average number of extinct

species for diﬀerent noise intensities. This time behavior is shown in Fig. 2. We see that

this number increases with noise intensity, and after the value ǫ = 0.1 reaches quickly the

normalized maximum value at ǫ = 10.

To analyze in more detail the inﬂuence of each species on the long time dynamics of

the ecosystem we calculate in this regime the local ﬁeld hi,loc(t) and the cavity ﬁeld hi,cav(t),
which is the ﬁeld acting on the ith population when this population is absent. The probability

distributions for both local and cavity ﬁelds have been obtained by simulations for diﬀerent

species in the presence and in absence of external noise. The results are shown in the next

section (see Fig. 3). We found that the probability distributions of the cavity ﬁelds diﬀer

substantially from those of local ﬁelds for the same species, while in the presence of noise

the two ﬁelds overlap. To quantify this overlap between the probabilities distributions of the

two ﬁelds we deﬁne an overlap coeﬃcient λ(t), which is the distance between the average

III. RESULTS AND COMMENTS

In the calculation the following parameters have been used: α = 1.2, J = 1, σ2

J =

0.005, N = 200; the number of averaging experiment used is Nexp = 1000. Concerning

the initial condition the parameters are:

no = 0.03. The dynamics of various

species are diﬀerent even if they are equivalent according to the parameters in the dynamical

ni

h

= 1, σ2

Eq. (1). However we note that to change the species index by ﬁxing the random matrix or to

change the random matrix by ﬁxing the species index is equivalent as regards the asymptotic

dynamical regime. Fig. 3 shows for various noise intensities the local and cavity ﬁelds

probability distributions at time t = 50 (a. u.). For noiseless dynamics the distributions of

the ﬁelds for the species i = 3 appear very narrow around their mean values and very spaced

each other. By increasing the noise intensity, we observe an equal enlargement of the two

distributions, maintaining however the same mean values. At ǫ = 0.1 the two distributions

start to overlap until, for stronger noise intensity (ǫ = 1), they superimpose each other. The

overlap coeﬃcient λ(t) is equal to zero. The noise makes equivalent all the species in the

asymptotic regime and the absence of some species doesn’t contribute to any changes in the

dynamics of all other species. The last plot in Fig. 3 (ǫ = 10) gives a delta distribution

around zero. This means that, at the time considered in our simulation (t = 50) and for

this noise intensity, all the species are extinct (see also Fig. 2).

The detailed time evolution of the overlap of the two distributions can be seen from

Fig. 4, where it is plotted the coeﬃcient deﬁned in Eq. (6). For ǫ = 0 the λ(t) coeﬃcient

increases with time. This is due to the diﬀerent time behavior of the distance between the

mean values of the ﬁeld distributions and of their standard deviation σ2

i,loc and σ2

i,cav. The

distance dh(t) = ¯hi,loc

¯hi,cav is almost constant in time, except a rapid initial transient

−

(see Fig. 5, ǫ = 0), but the corresponding evolution of the distribution widths decreases

rapidly in time. This eﬀect is due to the quenched random matrix. This behavior remains

unchanged until the noise intensity reaches the value of ǫ = 0.01. From this value of external

noise intensity some diﬀerences start to be visible (see Figs. 4, 5 and 6), and at ǫ = 1, after

some ﬂuctuations, both the distance dh(t) and the overlap coeﬃcient λ(t) reach a value close

to zero. The two ﬁeld distributions are totally overlapped.

It is worthwhile to note that the behaviors shown in Figs. 3, 4, 5 and 6 have been found

for some species, and changing the species diﬀerent evolutions of the distribution dynamics

appear and in particular of the λ(t) coeﬃcient. This is due to complexity of our ecosystem

and to the extinction process during the transient dynamics. Moreover this strange behav-

ior, found for some populations and in the asymptotic regime, is reminiscent of the phase

transition phenomenon [12], and it is related to the following peculiarities of our dynamical

system: (i) all the populations are positive; (ii) diﬀerent initial conditions drive the ecosys-

tem into diﬀerent attraction basins; and (iii) the complex structure of the attraction basins.

While in the presence of noise all the populations seem to be equivalent in the long time

regime, some populations, in the absence of external noise, have an asymptotical dynami-

cal behavior such that they signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the dynamics of other species. A more

detailed analysis on these points will be done in a forthcoming paper.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We analyzed the asymptotic regime of an ecosystem composed by N interacting species

in the presence of multiplicative noise. We ﬁnd the role of the noise on the asymptotic

probability distribution of populations and on the extinction process. Concerning the local

and the cavity ﬁelds, a phase transition like phenomenon is observed. Their probability

distributions tend to overlap each other in the presence of external noise, reaching strong

overlap for high noise intensity (

absence of noise. This phenomenon can be ascribed to the complexity of our ecosystem.

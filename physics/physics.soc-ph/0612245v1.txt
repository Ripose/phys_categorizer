Abstract

We here present a ﬁxed agents version of an original model of
the emergence of hierarchies among social agents ﬁrst introduced by
Bonabeau et al. Having interactions occurring on a social network
rather than among ’walkers’ doesn’t drastically alter the dynamics.
But it makes social structures more stable and give a clearer picture
of the social organisation in a ‘mixed’ regime.

1 Introduction

A number of models in socio- and econo-physics are inspired from
magnetism, starting with the pioneering work of F¨ollmer (1974) [1].
They concern the modeling of opinion dynamics and assume for in-
stance binary opinions of agents distributed on some social networks,
with variants which include the mean ﬁeld approximation. Agents
adjust their opinion under the inﬂuence of their neighbours. In many
models, agents follow the opinion of their neighbours via for instance

some ”voting” scheme: an agent would then check the opinions of
its neighbours and adjust its own opinion according to the majority’s
opinion. The observed dynamics resemble ferromagnetism.

But a large number of other models start from the opposite as-

sumption.

In the minority game [2], applied to ﬁnancial markets, agents
choose to behave in opposition with the majority:
if the others are
buying, you should sell (and the opposite). The minority game is only
one of such models to which one can relate the model of the emergence
of social classes based on the ultimatum game of Axtell et al [3], and
Bonabeau et al model [4] of the emergence of social hierarchies. This
Bonabeau et al approach, followed by the contributions of Ben-Naim
and Redner [5] (taking a mean ﬁeld approach) and of Stauﬀer [6], is
the original inspiration for the work presented here.

We consider agents i whose internal state h(i) is adjusted on the
occasion of binary encounters. h(i) can be interpreted as strength and
encounters as ﬁghts. On the occasion of a ﬁght, the winner, usually the
stronger agent, wins and its strength is increased by one. The looser
strength is decreased by one. By usually, we imply a probabilistic
process with some ”thermal” probability. Bonabeau et al original
model is a walkers’ model: agents are moving across a square lattice,
and interact only when they encounter on the same lattice site. The
main parameter of these models is the β discrimination parameter for
the outcome of the ﬁght process. In Bonabeau et al a phase transition
is observed: at low β values, a ”disordered” phase is observed with
a Gaussian distribution of agent strengths, while at high β values, a
large fraction of agents have extreme strength, positive or negative.
Several variants yield a sharp phase transition, but under questionable
assumptions. In Bonabeau et al, strength is allowed to go to inﬁnity
with time. In Stauﬀer’s model [6], when a moving average process is
introduced to limit strength, the transition is not sharp; Stauﬀer had
to introduce some extra dynamics on the β discrimination parameter
to get a sharp transition. The ﬁrst motivation for the present research
was to check the importance of the random ”walkers” dynamics on the
sharpness of the transition: would ﬁxed agents, at the nodes of a social
network, display a sharp transition towards some ”anti-ferromagnetic”
regime?

2 The model and its numerical imple-
mentation

We use a square lattice with periodic boundary conditions. Agents
don’t move and remain at lattice nodes. At each time step, an agent
i, randomly selected, updates its internal variable hi(t) through a ran-
dom process. The agent interacts with one of its four neighbours ran-
domly chosen. He wins with a probability P related to its neighbour’s
strength by a logit (or thermal) function according to:

P =

1
1 + exp(β(hj(t) − hi(t))

As in thermal physics, a large β coeﬃcient results in a nearly deter-
ministic choice in favour of the stronger agent, and in a nearly random
choice when β is small. As a result of the interaction, the winner’s
strength is increased by one, and the looser strength is decrease by
one. Suppose, e.g., that i wins, the updating gives:

hi(t) = (1 − γ)hi(t − 1) + 1
hj(t) = (1 − γ)hj(t − 1) − 1

,

.

These equations correspond to a moving average of past gains.
Gains increase strength, but past gains are discounted at a rate 1 − γ.
1/γ is the characteristic time of the dynamics. They imply one double
update, since two sites i and j are involved; one time step corresponds
to one double update per site.

We usually start simulations from a conﬁguration where all strengths

are 0, and run them for a long time to check the attractors of the dy-
namics. A typical time scale for the simulation is 10/γ updates per
site, i.e. ten times the characteristic time. This choice is also mo-
tivated by the equilibrium amplitude of the strength of a constant
winner:

Times proportional to 1/γ are needed to allow strength to saturate.

3 Simulations results

Apart from the dimension of the lattice which might give rise to some
size eﬀects, two parameters control the dynamics, β the discrimination
parameter and γ, the memory parameter. Our simulations display the
system conﬁguration at asymptotic time value or some kind of order
parameter.

We have chosen the same order parameter as Bonabeau et al and
followers, namely the standard deviation of the distribution of the
probability to win, σ. We ﬁrst checked at ﬁxed γ the evolution of σ
versus β, the discrimination coeﬃcient (ﬁgure 1).

The observed crossover, starting at values of β close to γ is smooth
and no size eﬀect is detectable between networks of size 10,000 and
40,0000 which could account for the observed smoothness. We also
checked, for the same reason, the inﬂuence of convergence times which
again is not noticeable after a number of double updates per agent
above 10/γ time steps (not represented here by a ﬁgure).

0.1 and 0.2. Simulation times per site are 10/γ.

To check the inﬂuence of both β and γ it is interesting to use a
reduced parameter. β/γ is a good candidate, by analogy with fer-
romagnetism. The mean ﬁeld theory of ferromagnetism predicts a
transition when β = z × J, where J is the coupling constant and z
the number of neighbours. We expect then ’something’ to happen
as a function of β/γ. Another model based on a logit choice and a
moving average of a utility function based on past experience is Weis-
buch et al model of Marseille ﬁshmarket [7] which also gives β/γ as a
reduced parameter. 1/γ being the characteristic strength involved in
the present problem, β/γ is then a reasonable choice.

Figure 2 displays the standard deviation of the distribution of the

probability to win, σ, as a function of β/γ,

As we guessed, the onset of a smooth crossover occurs slightly
above β/γ = 1 where the three curves meet. And σ saturates at 0.5,
which corresponds to all probabilities equally distributed between the
two values 0 and 1. But the function σ vs. β/γ is not universal: the
slope of the line near the crossover seems to increase with decreasing γ.

β/γ, observed for networks of size 100 × 100. γ values are 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2.
Simulation times per site are 10/γ.

The Bonabeau et al result, a vertical transition for inﬁnite strength, is
then consistent with ours for small γ. The same is true for Stauﬀer’s
result: no sharp transition for ﬁnite strength values. In other words,
our ﬁxed ﬁghters results are consistent with those obtained for walking
ﬁghters models.

A similar behaviour is observed in ﬁgure 3 for the relative average
amplitude of sites strength, another possible order parameter. At
large β/γ values, strength amplitudes saturate to 1/γ. The curves
cross around β/γ = 1, but they don’t collapse.

The histograms displayed in ﬁgure 4 provide a more direct repre-
sentation of the state of the system at diﬀerent β values. Strengths
vary between +10 and –10, respectively ±1/γ. In the low β region,
say β ≤ γ, the strength distribution is a Gaussian centered around 0.
By contrast, when β ≫ γ, two narrow peaks are observed at ±1/γ.
In between the transition is smooth.

time steps for diﬀerent values of β below and above 1/γ.

grey to intermediate values, and white to 10 strength. When β increases from
0 to 0.3, ’anti-ferromagnetic’ islands with checkerboard structure increase in
size and invade the whole lattice

7

The checkerboard pattern obtained when β = 0.3 is a clear picture
of the analogous of an ”anti-ferromagnetic” conﬁguration: all sites
have a maximum strength 1/γ, alternately positive and negative. For
the intermediate values of β, anti-ferromagnetic islands of size increas-
ing with β invade a sea of low-strength sites coloured in grey. At inter-
mediate β values, the checkerboard islands do not grow in time since
the low strength agents at their boundary have one neighbour within
the checkerboard structure against 3 outside. They tend to relax to-
wards the average strength after their interactions with checkerboard
sites.

This intermediate regime can be compared to type II supercon-
ductors which also exhibit a mixed regime between two values of the
external magnetic ﬁeld, where magnetisation increases continuously
with the ﬁeld. In the mixed regime, ’normal’ vortices regions are sur-
rounded by superconductive regions.

As observed in ﬁgure 6, the time evolution of the patterns in the
anti-ferromagnetic region implies two characteristic times: ﬁrst, ferro-
magnetic domains separated by low strength lines appear quite fast.
Two domains separated by a line are shifted by one site; in one di-
mension the structure would be:

+ – + – + – + 0 – + – + – + – + –
(where + is positive, – negative and 0 weak strength). The two an-
tiferromagnetic domains are phase shifted by π with respect to the
lattice structure.

The subsequent annealing process with coarsening of anti-ferro-

magnetic domains into a unique domain is much longer.

The online observation of the sites dynamics shows that two factors
account for the slow convergence dynamics and for the ﬁnite width of
the crossover:

• The structuring process into antiferromagnetic patches begins
early in time and when β/γ ≃ 1. But patches growing from
diﬀerent regions of the lattice don’t have any reason to be in
phase. Whenever intermediate strength (h ≃ 0) agents interact
against agents from the antiferromagnetic patches, their strength
is increased (in absolute value) by interaction with one side but
it is decreased when they interact with the other side.

• Since the strength diﬀerence between intermediate agents and
agents inside patches is half of the strength diﬀerence inside the
patches, a higher β value is necessary to maintain long range

β = 0.3 and γ = 0.1, after 1000, 5000 and 8000 time steps. The colour code
is the same as above. One ﬁrst observes a fast evolution towards a partial
anti-ferromagnetic structure with low strength line boundaries. Annealing of
the boundaries takes a longer time and is achieved after 10000 time steps as
observed in the previous ﬁgure.

order.

Finally, ﬁgure 7 returns to the question posed already by Fig.2:
Would we get for γ → 0 a sharp phase transition in the sense that the
slope of σ versus the ratio β/γ would become inﬁnite at some critical
value of this ratio? For this purpose we simulated much larger lattices,
for at least 100/γ time steps and 0.001 ≤ γ < 1. We also used regu-
lar updating, instead of the above random updating, and made minor
changes. There are long-time eﬀects preventing complete equilibra-
tion, presumably due to reptation of domain boundaries. Nevertheless
this ﬁgure conﬁrms our guess from Fig.2 about a sharp transition in
the limit γ → 0. The critical ratio β/γ seems to be 1.

4 Conclusions

Our ﬁrst aim was to compare a ﬁxed agents model of ’ﬁghters’ with
results obtained for ’walkers’ models of Bonabeau et al. We wanted to
know whether the smoothness of the crossover observed when strength
remains ﬁnite was due to the extra randomness introduced by walkers
diﬀusion. We demonstrated that a ﬁxed agent model also displays a
smooth crossover.

The observation of equilibrium patterns shows that small anti-
ferromagnetic domains start to develop in the intermediate mixed re-

gion, when β ≃ γ, but inﬁnite long range order is only achieved for
values of the discrimination parameter β above the onset of the mixed
region. The width of the mixed region appears to increase with γ.

Interpretations of the lattice in terms of social networks show that
the hierarchy is re-enforced by the fact each agent interacts with the
same neighborhood. On the other hand, social networks are more
random than lattices. They are not totally random as Erd¨os-R´enyi
nets and display more betweenness (small loops), than regular lat-
tices. But the stability of the ordered regime obtained with square
lattices containing only non-frustrated loops cannot be expected from
more random structures: frustrated loops introduce glassy dynamics,
with wider crossover and more irreducible ﬂuctuations in the ordered
regime.

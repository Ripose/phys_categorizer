Models that provide insight into how extreme positions regarding any so-
cial phenomenon may spread in a society or at the global scale are of great
current interest. A realistic model must account for the fact that globaliza-
tion and internet have given rise to scale-free networks of interactions between
people. We propose a novel model which takes into account the nature of the
interactions network, and provides some key insights into this phenomenon,
including: (1) There is a fundamental diﬀerence between a hierarchical net-
work whereby people are inﬂuenced by those that are higher on the hierarchy
but not by those below them, and a symmetrical network where person-on-
person inﬂuence works mutually. (2) A few ”fanatics” can inﬂuence a large
fraction of the population either temporarily (in the hierarchical networks)
or permanently (in symmetrical networks). Even if the ”fanatics” disappear,
the population may still remain susceptible to the positions advocated by
them. The model is, however, general and applicable to any phenomenon for
which there is a degree of enthusiasm or susceptibility to in the population.

Given the current political climate around the world, and the rise of
extreme ideologies in many parts of the globe, models that can provide insight
into how extreme ideologies and opinions spread in a society are clearly of
current interest. In particular, (1) given that globalization and the internet
have created scale-free network of interactions between people [1], and (2)
given the fact that although extreme ideologies are typically advocated by
very small fringe groups, they may continue to survive and even thrive over
certain time scales, it is clearly important to understand the role of such
factors on the opinion of a population, and how they aﬀect such antisocial
behavior as terrorism.

In this Rapid Communication we propose a novel model in order to un-
derstand this phenomenon. The model is used to study how the opinions
of various segments of a population may be inﬂuenced by their interactions,
and how the connectivity of the interaction network inﬂuences the survival
or disappearance of an opinion. We represent the network of interactions
between people by a scale-free network [1] and study various scenarios that
can aﬀect the dynamics of the spreading of an opinion in a population.

In the model the entire population is divided into four fractions: The
general population G, those portions of the population that are susceptible
to, or excited about, an opinion, which we denote, respectively, by S and E,
and the fanatics F who advocate an opinion. Initially, everyone belongs to
the G group except a core group of a few fanatics which, in the present paper,
is assumed to be four (but can be generalized to any number). Then, people
can change their opinions depending on the neighbors to whom they listen
to. Members of the S, E, and F groups can convince people in the G group
to change their opinion and become susceptible to the fanatics’s opinion;
members of the E and F groups can convince the S group to become E;
members of the F group can convince the E’s members to convert to F , but
members of the S, E, and F groups can also directly return to the general
population G. The fanatics are created initially by some outside event which
is not part of the model. All the opinion changes happen with a probability
p which, in most cases, is taken to be 1/2, but can clearly be generalized to
other values if there is any evidence for it. Such a model can be applied not
only to terrorism and other extreme opinions, but also to any other social
phenomenon for which there is a degree of enthusiasm, or susceptibility, in a
society.

Another model of opinion dynamics has been proposed recently based
on the percolation model [2]. Another recent model [3] uses, similar to our

work, scale-free networks, but its dynamics and the quantities that it studies
are completely diﬀerent from ours. The partition of the population and
the probabilities of opinion change in our model are similar to the model
of Castillo-Chavez and Song [4] who proposed a deterministic continuum
model in terms of a set of nonlinear diﬀerential equations. Their model
computes average behavior over the entire population and does not deal
with individuals. Such an approximation cannot answer, for example, the
question of whether or how a few fanatics can convince an entire population.
It cannot also take into account the eﬀect of the scale-free structure of the
interaction network. Using a regular lattice, such as a square lattice, is also
not realistic because the range of interactions is limited. Instead, networks
[1] between people or computers are described better as scale-free, and a
network of the Barab´asi-Albert type is the most widespread. Here, a few
people have many connections, most people have rather few, and there is
no sharp boundary between these extremes: The number of people having k
connections each decays as 1/k3. (Power laws also hold for the probability
of terror attacks [5].) These networks are built by starting with four people
all connected to each other. Then newcomers join the network one after the
other by connecting to the already-existing four members, with a probability
proportional to the number of connections the member already has.

In our model we use two Barab´asi-Albert types of scale-free networks.
One is the hierarchical network with directed connections [6, 7], which is a
history-dependent network in which a member only listens to and is convinced
by the four people who joined earlier and were selected by the member. The
four people, who are higher in the hierarchy than the new member, do not
listen to the new network member. This is presumably the way a group
with a rigid and hierarchical command structure operates. Thus, one has a
hierarchy determined by who joins the group ﬁrst. The second type of the
network that we use is symmetrical such that all the connected members
may inﬂuence each other, which is the way a group with a more ﬂexible
command structure may operate so that even if the top leaders (the original
fanatics) are eliminated, the group and its inﬂuence on people’s opinion may
survive. To simulate the model using both types of the network we use
regular sequential updating. We start with four fanatics on the network core
while everybody else belongs to the general population G. We assume that
the initial four fanatics are charismatic leaders forming the initial core of the
network and, thus, becoming well-connected later.

Figure 1 shows the results using the hierarchical network.

that in the ﬁrst few time steps few fanatics can make more than a million in
a population of 25 million susceptible, even though the number of fanatics
falls down in the ﬁrst steps. The E and F groups grow to much smaller
percentages. Finally, all three groups, S, E, and F vanish, and everybody
returns to the general population G. However, the S and E groups can
survive longer than the fanatics; it is even possible that the fanatics die out
accidentally after three time steps. Nevertheless, the avalanche that they set
in motion stays on for a long time.

In the symmetric, instead of hierarchical, networks the survival of the S
and E groups is also possible (see Fig. 2), instead of their eventual extinction
that Fig. 1 indicates. For a probability 1/2 to return from the S, E, and F
groups to the general population G, the fanatics decrease from 4 to 2 in the

ﬁrst time step and vanish afterwards; nobody becomes excited, but up to 100
people become susceptible for some time (the continuous curve in Fig. 2). If,
however, we reduce to 0.1 (from 1/2) the probability to return from the S, E,
and F groups to G, then all four populations survive as large fractions of
the population (symbols in Fig. 2). The mutual reinforcement of opinions in
symmetric networks, which is impossible in the hierarchical networks, greatly
increases the spread of opinions. For comparison, Fig. 3 shows the results for
the hierarchical network with the same reduced probability of 0.1 to return,
indicating that even with this probability everybody becomes normal (returns
to the general population) after some time.

The great inﬂuence of the four initial fanatics comes from the fact that
these founders of the network, numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 in its history, are

well connected. The later a person joins the interaction network (higher
membership numbers), the smaller is in general the number of connections
and, thus, the inﬂuence. This eﬀect is shown in Fig. 4 where the top curve
shows how up to 5% of the population become susceptible under the inﬂuence
of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. If, instead, network members 11, 12, 13, and 14
are taken as the initial radicals (second curve from above), then less than 1%
become susceptible. The lower curves show analogously how the inﬂuence of
the initial four fanatics is reduced if we take them as the four which follow
numbers 102, 103, . . . , 107 in the networks of size 25 million. We regard the
possibility of a few people to inﬂuence a large fraction of the population as
one of the main result of this paper.

In summary, we ﬁnd important diﬀerences between the inﬂuence of the

hierarchical and symmetric networks on opinion dynamics. If the followers
listen to the leaders but not the other way round, then the ideas of the leaders
will die out (Fig. 3). If the leaders also listen to their followers, then their
opinions may last long (Fig. 2). The closer the leaders are to the core of
the network, the higher is their impact on the general population (Fig. 4).
Further predictions of the model will be reported elsewhere.

The eﬃciency of traﬃc routing on complex networks can be reﬂected by two key measurements i.e.
the system capacity and the average data packets travel time. In this paper, we propose a mixing
routing strategy by integrating local static and dynamic information for enhancing the eﬃciency of
traﬃc on scale-free networks. The strategy is governed by a single parameter. Simulation results
show that there exists a optimal parameter value by considering both maximizing the network
capacity and reducing the packet travel time. Comparing with the strategy by adopting exclusive
local static information, the new strategy shows its advantages in improving the eﬃciency of the
system. The detailed analysis of the mixing strategy is provided. This work suggests that how to
eﬀectively utilize the larger degree nodes plays the key role in the scale-free traﬃc systems.

INTRODUCTION

Communication networks such as the Internet, World-
Wide-Web and pear-to-pear networks play an important
role in modern society. Dynamical properties of these
systems have attracted tremendous interests and devo-
tion among not only engineering but also physics com-
munities [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. The ultimate
goal of studying these large communication networks is
to control the increasing traﬃc congestion and improve
the eﬃciency of information transportation. Many re-
cent studies have focused on the eﬃciency improvement
of communication networks which is usually considered
from two aspects: one is modifying the underlying net-
work structure [11, 12, 13] and the other is developing
better routing strategies [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. Compar-
ing with the former, the latter is preferable with respect
to the high cost of changing underlying structure.
In
traﬃc systems, the structure of the underlying network
play an signiﬁcant role in the traﬃc dynamics. In order
to develop practical routing strategies, understanding the
eﬀect of network on the traﬃc dynamics is a central prob-
lem.

Since the surprising discovery of scale-free property of
real world networks by Barab´si and Albert [20, 21], it
is worthwhile to investigate the traﬃc dynamics on the
scale-free networks instead of random and regular net-
works. How the traﬃc dynamics are inﬂuenced by many
kinds of structures, such as Web-graph [14, 15], hierarchi-
cal trees [4] and Barab´asi-Albert network [6], has been ex-
tensively investigated. A variety of empirically observed
dynamical behaviors have been reproduced by such traf-
ﬁc models, including 1/f -like noise of load series, phase
transition from free ﬂow state to congestion, power-law

scaling correlation between ﬂux and the relevant variance
and cascading [3, 14, 15, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]. Moreover,
some previous work pointed out that traﬃc processes tak-
ing place on the networks do also remarkably aﬀect the
evolution of the underlying structure [27, 28]. To model
traﬃc dynamics on networks, especially for the Internet
and WWW, data-packet generating rate together with
their randomly selected source and destinations are in
introduced by previous work [29]. Some models assume
that packets are routed along shortest paths from ori-
gins to destinations [4, 6]. However, due to the diﬃ-
culty in searching and storing shortest paths between any
pair of nodes of large networks, the routing strategies
based on local topological information have been pro-
posed for better mimicking real traﬃc systems and for
more widely potential application, such as Pear-to-Pear
networks [14, 15, 17].

Among previous studies, the eﬃciency of the commu-
nication networks has received much attention for its
practical importance [4, 6, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19]. The ef-
ﬁciency of the traﬃc system can be reﬂected by capacity
and communication velocity of the system. The capac-
ity is measured by the onset of phase transition from
free ﬂow to congestion, which has been investigated in
several works [4, 6, 17, 18, 19]. The phase transition
points can be denoted by the maximal packet generat-
ing rate, under which the system is in the free ﬂow state
and no congestion occurs, so that the system can main-
tain it normal and eﬃcient functioning. The communi-
cation velocity is measured by the average packet travel
time. We note that these two quantities are not equiv-
alent for estimating the eﬃciency, but even contradic-
tory to each other. Take scale-free networks for example.
Scale-free networks possess shorter average path length
in contrast with random and regular networks, which is
attributed to the existence of hub nodes. Thus, data
packets can transmit much faster in the scale-free net-
works. However, suppose that too much data ﬂow passes

through those hub nodes, it will lead to the congestion
at those nodes and decrease the network capacity. Aim-
ing to solve the conﬂict between the network capacity
and the communication speed, we propose a new routing
strategy adopting in the scale-free networks based on lo-
cal static and dynamic information, which are the local
structure and traﬃc ﬂux, respectively. Comparing with
the strategy based on exclusive local static information
[17], both the capacity of the networks and the average
packet travel time are considerably improved by adopting
the mixing strategy. The eﬀects of the new strategy on
the eﬃciency of the scale-free traﬃc system are discussed
in detail. The introduced strategy may has potential ap-
plication in pear-to-pear networks.

The paper is organized as follows. In the following sec-
tion, we describe the model rules and the relevant deﬁni-
tions in detail. In Sec. III we demonstrate the simulation
results and the discussion. In the last section, the present
work is concluded.

II. THE MODEL AND DEFINITIONS

Barab´asi-Albert model

is the simplest and a well-
known model which can generate networks with power-
law degree distribution P (k) ∼ k−γ, where γ = 3. With-
out losing generality we construct the network structure
by following the same method used in Ref.
[20]: Start-
ing from m0 fully connected nodes, a new node with m0
edges is added to the existing graph at each time step
according to preferential attachment, i.e., the probabil-
ity Πi of being connected to the existing node i is pro-
portional to the degree ki. Then we model the traﬃc
of packets on the given graph. At each time step, there
are R packets generated in the system, with randomly
selected sources and destinations. We treat all the nodes
as both hosts and routers [6, 14, 15] and assume that
each node can deliver at most C packets per time step
towards their destinations. All the nodes perform a par-
allel local search among their immediate neighbors.
If
a packet’s destination is found within the searched area
of node l, i.e. the immediate neighbors of l, the packets
will be delivered from l directly to its target and then
removed from the system. Otherwise, the probability of
a neighbor node i, to which the packet will be delivered
is as follows:

Pl→i =

ki(ni + 1)β
Pj kj(nj + 1)β ,

(1)

where, the sum runs over the immediate neighbors of the
node l. ki is the degree of node i and ni is the number of
packets in the queue of i. β is an introduced tunable pa-
rameter. ki and ni are the so-called static and dynamic
information, respectively. Adding one to ni is to guaran-
tee the nodes without packets have probability to receive
packets. During the evolution of the system, FIFO (ﬁrst-
in ﬁrst-out) rule is applied and each packet has no mem-
ory of previous steps. Under the control of the routing

strategy, all packets perform a biased random-walk like
move. All the simulations are performed with choosing
C = 5.

To implement our strategy, each node should know the
traﬃc load of its neighbors, which can be implemented
by using the keep-alive messages that routers (nodes)
continuously exchange real-time information with their
peers [16]. However, taking into account the information
transmission cost, the exchanged information may be up-
dated every few second between neighbors. Therefore, we
study the eﬀect of transmission delay on the traﬃc dy-
namics. The delay in our model is deﬁned as the number
of time steps (period) of receiving updating information
from neighbors.

In order to characterize the network capacity, we use

the order parameter presented in Ref. [4]:

η(R) = lim
t→∞

h∆Loadi
R · ∆t

,

(2)

where Load(t) is deﬁned as the number of packets within
the network at time t. ∆Load = Load(t + ∆t) − Load(t)
with h· · · i indicates average over time windows of width
∆t. The order parameter represents the ratio between
the outﬂow and the inﬂow of packets calculated over long
enough period. In the free ﬂow state, due to the balance
of created and removed packets, the load does not de-
pend on time, which brings a steady state. Thus when
time tends to be unlimited, η is about zero. Otherwise,
when R exceeds a critical value Rc, the packets will con-
tinuously pile up within the network, which destroys the
stead state. Thus, the quantities of packets within the
system will be a function of time, which makes η a con-
stant more than zero. Therefore, a sudden increment
of η from zero to nonzero characterizes the onset of the
phase transition from free ﬂow state to congestion, and

III. SIMULATION RESULTS

As mentioned above, the eﬃciency of the system is re-
ﬂected by both the network capacity and the communi-
cation velocity. We ﬁrst investigate the order parameter
η as a function of generating rate R for diﬀerent model
parameter β, as shown in Fig. 1. One can ﬁnd that
for each β, when R is less than a speciﬁc value Rc, η is
zero; it suddenly increases when R is slightly larger than
Rc. Moreover, in this ﬁgure, diﬀerent β corresponds to
diﬀerent Rc, thus we investigate the network capacity Rc
depending on β for ﬁnding the optimal value of parameter
β. Figure 2 shows that in the case of no time delay, the
network capacity is considerably enhanced by reducing β,
and when β is less than a speciﬁc value, approximately
−3, the capacity reaches an upper limit. The dynamic
information ni represents the amount of traﬃc ﬂux of
node i. The eﬀect of decreasing β is to allow packets to
circumvent the nodes with heavier traﬃc burden and al-
leviate the congestion on those nodes. While for the case
of only adopting local topology information (static strat-
egy) [17, 30], the maximal network capacity is 23 with
choosing C = 5. Therefore, the higher maximal capacity
by adopting the new strategy indicates that the dynamic
information is a better reﬂection of congestion than the
static one. Moreover, the capacity with time delay are
also studied, as shown in Fig. 2. When the delay is not
long, Rc is slightly reduced as increasing the delay, and
the onset of the upper limit is still at β = −3. However,
for the long delay, such as delay = 10, it has remark-
able inﬂuence on the network capacity. There exists a

maximal value of Rc as the point of β = −1 instead of
reaching upper limit and the network capacity is reduced.
The feedback information with long period cannot well
reﬂect the real circumstance of the neighbor nodes, which
leads to the instabilities in the system, so that the capac-
ity decreases. Furthermore, we perform simulations with
larger network size, N = 5000, as exhibited in Fig. 2.
The curve of Rc vs β displays the same tendency with
the cases of N = 1000. It is the longer average short-
est path length that results in the decrease of network
capacity comparing with the cases of N = 1000.

The communication velocity of the system can be esti-
mated by the mean travel time of the packets from their
origins to destinations over a long period. The mean
travel time hT i vs creating rate R for diﬀerent param-
eter β are demonstrated in Fig. 3. We also compare
the behavior of hT i by adopting static strategy [30] with
adopting the new one upon the identical network struc-
ture, where α = −1 corresponds to the optimal param-
eter value of the static strategy as shown in Fig. 3. All
the simulations are performed within the steady state, in
which hT i is independent of time step. While if the sys-
tem enters the jammed state, hT i will increase as time
grows, ultimately, it will be prone to be unlimited due
to packets’ continuous accumulation in the system. By
adopting the static strategy, hT i is approximately inde-
pendent of R, which is because that the static routing
algorithm is based on exclusive topological information.
Although the static strategy strongly improves the net-
work capacity, it ignores the importance of hub nodes i.e.
greatly reducing the diameter of the network. In contrast
with the static strategy, the new strategy by integrating

the local static and dynamic information can not only
considerably enhance the network capacity but also make
the hub nodes eﬃciently utilized. One can see in Fig. 3,
when R is not too large, hT i by adopting the new strat-
egy for all β is much shorter than that by adopting static
strategy. The advantages of using the new strategy can
be explained from Eq. 1. For very small R, few packets
accumulate in the queue, thus Pi ∼ ki, which is con-
sistent with the search algorithm proposed in Ref.
[31].
The high eﬃciency of this algorithm for searching target
nodes has been demonstrated by numerical simulations
[31]. Hence, it is the shorter average distances travelled
by packets hLi that induces the shorter hT i in the free
ﬂow state, which can be seen in the inset of Fig. 3, where
hLi is nearly the same with hT i for identical value of β.
When increasing R, packets start to accumulate on the
large degree nodes, the new strategy can automatically
decrease the probability of packets delivered to those hub
nodes according to the dynamic information. Then, when
R approaches to the Rc, packets are routed by the mixing
strategy to circumvent those hub nodes, which become
the bottleneck of the system. Therefore, near the phase
transition point, hT i shows the same value by adopting
two diﬀerent strategies. Combing the results that β = −3
is not only the onset of upper limit of the network capac-
ity but also corresponds to the shortest hT i in the case of
maximal network capacity, we can conclude that β = −3
is the optimal choice.

We further investigate the behavior of traﬃc load in-
ﬂuenced by the routing strategy. Fig. 3 displays the
average load hLoadi as a function of R for two strate-
gies with diﬀerent parameters. For static strategy with
the optimal parameter, Load is a linear function of R.
As to the new strategy, for a wide range of R, the load
adopting the new strategy is lower than that by adopt-

ing the static one. When R approaches the critical value
Rc ,the load with the new strategy turns to be larger.
We also observe that by choosing β = −3, the system
aﬀords the lowest traﬃc load among the whole range of
R, which also demonstrates that β = −3 is the optimal
choice. Actually, there exists some relationship between
mean packets travel time and average load. According
to the Little’s law [32] in the queueing theory, one can
easily obtain < hLoadi = R · hT i. Note that this result
is only satisﬁed in the steady state due to the balance
between created and removed nodes.

To give a detailed insight into the eﬀect of the new
strategy, we investigate the queue length of a node nk
as a function of its degree k with selecting the optimal
parameter for diﬀerent R. The queue length of a node
is deﬁned as the number of packets in the queue of that
node. The results are shown in Fig. 4. One can see that
when R is not large, nk vs k shows power law properties
and the slope for diﬀerent R is the same. These behaviors
are attributed to the domination of static information. In
Eq. 1, small R leads to the small ni, and the forwarding
probability is mainly determined by the node degree i.e.
static information. Therefore, nk versus k demonstrates
universal scaling property [17]. For medium value of R,
such as R = 20, the new strategy mainly aﬀects traﬃc
load on the large degree nodes. The strategy according to
Eq.1 allows packets to circumvent the large degree nodes
which bear heavier traﬃc burden. When R approaches
to the phase transition point Rc, we can see in Fig. 4 that
traﬃc burden on all diﬀerent degree nodes is almost the
same. This average eﬀect results in the maximal network
capacity in the case of identical node delivering capacity.

IV. CONCLUSION

We have proposed a new routing strategy by integrat-
ing local static and dynamic information. The advan-
tages of this strategy for delivering data packets on scale-
free networks have been demonstrated from two aspects
of network capacity and mean packets travel time. The
short mean packets travel time is mainly due to the suf-
ﬁcient use of hub nodes. The large network capacity is
caused by the utilization of dynamic information which
reﬂects the traﬃc burden on nodes. The present study
indicates that the large degree nodes play an important
role in packets delivery. The packets can ﬁnd their tar-
gets with higher probability if they pass by the large de-
gree nodes, which results in shorter average travel time
by packets. However, the large degree nodes are also
easily congested if large amount of packets are prone to
pass through them. The introduced strategy can make
the large degree nodes fully used when packet creating
rate is low, and also allow packets to bypass those nodes

5

when they aﬀord heavy traﬃc burden. Thus the system’s
eﬃciency is greatly improved.

In addition, we note that the new strategy should not
be hard for implementation. The local static i.e. topol-
ogy information can be easily acquired and stored in each
router. The local dynamic information could be obtained
by using the keep-alive messages that router continuously
exchange with their peers [16]. The strategy may has po-
tential application in pear-to-pear networks.

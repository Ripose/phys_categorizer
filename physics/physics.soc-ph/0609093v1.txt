Abstract

We study the implied default distributions for the iTraxx-CJ tranches by means of the Principle of

Maximum Entropy. The proﬁles are quite diﬀerent from those of some popular probabilistic models.

We analyze their correlation structures, the conditional default probabilities pij and conditional

default correlations ρij. Here the subscript ij means that the default probability and correlation are

estimated under i obligors are defaulted and j obligors are non-defaulted among N obligors. The

implied default distribution, ρn0 shows singular behavior, jumps high and then decreases rapidly to

zero with n. Correspondingly pn0 increases with n and saturates to some maximum value below 1.

Such a behavior implies that the credit market expects a middle scale avalanche. We also discuss

the “True” default correlation implied by the market quotes.

Describing and understanding the crises in markets are intriguing subjects in ﬁnancial

engineering and econophysics [1, 2, 3]. In the context of econophysics, the mechanism of

systemic failure in banking has been studied [4, 5]. Power law distribution of avalanches

and several scaling laws in the context of percolation theory were found. The stability and

instability of stock and foreign exchange market have also been studied [6]. In the ﬁnancial

engineering, many products have been invented to the credit risks. CDS is a single-name

credit derivative which are targeted on the default of one single obligor. Collateralized debt

obligations (CDOs) are ﬁnancial innovations to securitize portfolios of defaultable assets,

which are called credit portfolios. They provide protection against a subset of total loss on

a credit portfolio in exchange for payments.

From econophysical viewpoint, they give valuable insights about the market implications

on default dependencies and clustering of defaults. This aspect is very important, because

the main diﬃculty in the understanding credit events is that we do not have enough informa-

tion about them. By the empirical studies of the historical data on credit events, the default

probability pd and default correlation ρd were estimated [7]. However, more detailed infor-

mation is necessary in the pricing of credit derivatives and in the evaluation of the models

in econophysics. The quotes of the CDOs depend on the proﬁles of the default distribution

function. From the market quotes, it is possible to infer them. Recently, such an implied

loss distribution function attracts attention in the studies of the credit derivatives. Instead

of using popular credit pricing models, Hull and White proposed to use the implied loss

distribution [8]. Their method is to express the loss distribution by superposing binomial

distributions Bi(p, N) with mixing function f (p). They have assumed the smoothness of

f (p) and from the market quotes f (p) have been determined. In this letter, we propose to

use the principle of maximum entropy to infer the default distribution function. Further-

more, we try to read the market implication hidden in the quotes of CDOs. We estimate

the conditional default probabilities and default correlations and discuss their meanings.

CDOs provide protection against losses on credit portfolios. The interesting point of

CDOs is that they are divided into several parts (called as ’tranches’). The tranches have

priorities which are deﬁned by attachment point aL and detachment point aH. The seller

of protection agrees to cover all losses between aLKT otal and aHKT otal where KT otal is the

initial total notional of the portfolio. That is, if the loss is below aLKT otal, the tranche does

not cover it. Only when it exceeds aLKT otal, the tranche begins to cover it. If it exceeds

aHKT otal, the notional becomes zero. The seller of protection receives payments at rate s

on an initial notional (aH − aL)KT otal. Each loss that is covered reduces the notional on

which payments are based. A typical CDO has a life of 5 years during which the seller

of protection receives periodic payments. Usually these payments are made quarterly in

arrears.

In addition, to bring the periodic payments up to date, an accrual payment is

performed. Furthermore, the seller of protection makes a payment equal to the loss to the

buyer of protection. The loss is the reduction in the notional principal times one less the

recovery rate R.

The iTraxx-CJ is an equally weighted portfolio of N = 50 CDSs on Japanese companies.

The notional principal of CDSs is K and KT otal is 50K. The recovery rate is R = 0.35. The

standard attachment and detachment points are {0%, 3%},{3%, 6%},{6%, 9%},{9%, 12%}

and {12%, 22%}. We denote them as {ai

L, ai

H} with i = 1, · · · , 5. Table I shows the tranche

structures and quotes for iTraxx-CJ (Series 2) on August 30, 2005. We denote the upfront

payment as Ui and the annual payment rate as si in basis points per year for the ith tranche.

In the last row, we show the data for the index which cover all losses for the portfolio. In

the 6th column, we show the initial notional N i

0 in units of K.

The value of contract is the present value of the expected cash ﬂows. For simplicity, we

treat 5-years as one term and write T = 5[year]. We also assume that defaults occur in

the middle of the period. We denote the notional principal for ith tranche outstanding at

3

maturity as N i

T . The expected payoﬀ of contract is

Here, < A > means the expectation value of A and r is the risk-free rate of interest. The

The total value of the contract to the seller of protection is eq.(1)-eq.(2). Risk neutral values

of si and Ui are determined so that eq.(1) equals eq.(2). Conversely, the market quotes for si
and Ui tell us about the expected notional principal < N i

the maximum entropy principle or eq.(5). In order to obtain a more smooth proﬁle, one way

is to add a bending rigidity term in eq.(4).

abilistic models. The models have two parameters, the default probability pd and default

correlation ρd. We set them with the same values of the implied distribution as pd = 1.65%

and ρd = 6.55%. As models, we use the Gaussian copula model, which is a standard model in

the ﬁnancial engineering [8], beta-binomial distribution (BBD), and long-range Ising model.

The reason to adopt the long-range Ising model, instead of the usual model on some lattice,

is that in the ﬁnancial engineering all obligors are usually assumed to be related with each

other with the same strength. In addition, the long-range Ising model can be expressed as

a superposition of two binomial distributions for suﬃciently large N and it is very tractable

[9].

We see that all model gives poor ﬁts to the implied distribution. The Gaussian copula

model and BBD show monotonic dependence on n. The implied distribution shows bump

FIG. 3: Pascal triangle for the construction of correlated binomial model

structure. The long-range Ising model has a non-monotonic dependence, however the posi-

tion of the second peak is near n = N. Its proﬁle is quite diﬀerent from that of the implied

distribution.

In order to understand these behaviors, we study the correlation structures of the distri-

butions. More explicitly, we estimate the conditional default probabilities pij and conditional

default correlation ρij. Here the subscript ij means that the default probability and corre-

lation are estimated under i obligors are defaulted and j obligors are non-defaulted among

N obligors. p00 = pd and ρ00 = ρd hold. From the joint probabilities X N −n

, pij and ρij are

n

easily estimated. In our previous work on the construction of correlated binomial distribu-
tions, we introduce a Pascal triangle [10]. On its node, we put X j

i and on its bonds, we put

pij and qij = 1 − pij. See Figure 3. These quantities are related as pij =

. Furthermore,

Xj
i+1

i

the conditional correlation ρij are calculated as pi+1j = pij + ρij(1 − pij).

The joint probabilities X N −n

n

from the implied default distribution are on the bottom line

of the triangle. Then recursively solving the above relations to the vertex X 0

0 = 1, we obtain
all pijs and ρijs. About the Gaussian copula, we have done the same procedure. BBD and

long-range Ising model, these quantities were estimated explicitly [10, 11].

Figure 4 depicts ρn0 and pn0. ρn0 for the implied distribution shows a singular behavior.

It has a peak at small n and then decays to zero rapidly. ρn0 for the Gaussian copula
also has a short peak and decays slowly. BBD’s ρn0 decays slowly as ρn0 = ρd

behaviors are reﬂected in the graph of pn0. Recall the relation pn+1 0 = pn0 + (1 − pn0)ρn0.

p00 = pd and p10 = pd + (1 − pd)ρd, all curves (n, pn 0) go through the two points (0, pd)

and (1, pd + (1 − pd)ρd). For n ≥ 2, the curves departs from each other. One should note

that ρn0 is proportional to ∆pn0 = pn+1 0 − pn0. The long-range Ising model’s ρn0 rapidly

increases to 1, pn0 also increases to 1 rapidly. For n = 3, p3 0 ≃ 1 and this means that all the

obligors always default simultaneously if three of them are defaulted, which corresponds to

the biggest avalanche. The Gaussian copula and BBD’s pn0 show mild curves and increase

to 1 with n. The distribution of the size of avalanches should be very wide. On the other

hand, pn0 for the implied default distribution, it increases rapidly as compared with the

Gaussian copula and BBD. However, it soon saturates to some maximum value ≃ 0.35 at

n ≃ 6. It means that if more that 6 defaults occur, the obligors default independently. The

number of defaults obeys the binomial distribution with p ≃ 0.35 and the distribution has

the second peak at 0.35 × 50 ≃ 18.

We have also studied the quotes of iTraxx-Europe and CDX IG (U.S.A.), which are

CDOs of European and American companies (N = 125). We have ﬁtted eq.(5) to the

market quotes on August 30, 2005. The implied distributions and ρn0 are plotted in Figure

5. The implied distributions are more complex than that of iTraxx-CJ, ρn0 shows the same

singular behavior.

At last we make a comment about the tranche (compound) correlation, which is the

standard correlation measure in the ﬁnancial engineering [8]. The method is to imply cor-

relation ρi

d so that the equality < N i

T >= N i

T,Implied holds. Here, the expectation value is

calculated with the Gaussian copula distribution. Table II shows the tranche correlations

for the quotes of iTraxx-CJ on August 30,2005. In the last column, we show the entropy

maximum value derived from the implied default distribution. As we have shown previously,

the Gaussian copula model gives poor ﬁt to the implied distribution. The tranche corre-

lations are completely diﬀerent from the entropy maximum value. In addition, it depends

on which tranche the correlation is estimated. Such a dependence is known as “correlation

smile” [12]. We think that “True” default correlation is approximately given by the entropy

maximum value and the tranche correlations are an artifact of using the Gaussian copula

distribution to ﬁt the market quotes. As long as the probabilistic model gives poor ﬁt to

the market quotes, the default correlation varies among the tranches. This is the origin of

the “correlation smile”.

We conclude with some future problems. In this letter, we propose to use the maximum

entropy principle to study the implied default distributions. Their proﬁles are quite diﬀerent

from those of popular probabilistic models. We compare their correlation structures and

ﬁnd a singular behavior of the conditional correlation ρn0. Next problem is to invent a

probabilistic model which capture the correlation structure.

In addition, our cash ﬂow

treatment in eq.(1) and eq.(2) should be reﬁned.

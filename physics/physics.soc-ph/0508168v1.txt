Abstract

We present a modiﬁed susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model on com-

plex networks, small-world and scale-free, to study epidemic spreading with

the effect of time delay which is introduced to the infected phase. Considering

the topology of the network, both uniform and degree-dependent delays are

studied during the contagion process. We ﬁnd that the existence of time delay

will enhance both outbreaks and prevalence of infectious diseases in the net-

1 Introduction

Complex weblike structures describe a wide variety of systems of high technological

and intellectual importance and have attracted an increasing interest recently.[1, 2, 3]

The explosion of the general interest in the problem of the structure and evolution

of most different networks is mainly connected with two characters, the small aver-

age path lengths among any two nodes (small-world property)[4] and a power law
distribution (scale-free property), P (k) ∼ k−γ with 2 ≤ γ ≤ 3, for the probability

that any node has k connections to other nodes.[5]

In the study of complex networks, a good example is to inspect the effect of their

complex features on the dynamics of epidemic and disease spreading. It is easy to

foresee that the characterization and understanding of epidemic dynamics on these

networks can ﬁnd immediate applications to a large number of problems, such as

computer virus infections, distribution of wealth, transmission of public opinion,

etc. Recent papers[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] have given some valuable insights of that:

for small-world networks, there is a critical threshold below which an infection with

a spreading rate dies out; on the contrary, for scale-free networks, even an infection

with a low spreading rate will prevalence the entire population.

In many social and biological systems, however, temporal delay is natural and

the ﬁnite time interval required for the information transmission between two ele-

ments may be important.[13, 14, 15] In this paper we will introduce time delay to the

standard SIS model on two prototype complex networks, the Watts-Strogatz (WS)

model and the Barab´asi-Albert (BA) model. Which is motivated by the following

questions: during the process of epidemic spreading, if an individual is infected

there is always a period of time before he (or she) becomes recovery, including the

time an infected individual is found and sent to a hospital, and the time a patient is

being cured, etc.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we ﬁrst deﬁne the model with time

2

delay on complex networks. Then we discuss the uniform delay in Sec. III and the

degree-dependent delay in Sec. IV. Finally, in Sec. V we draw our conclusions and

perspectives.

2 The Model

In this section, we shall introduce the effect of time delay to the standard SIS model

on complex networks, in which each node represents an individual of the population

and the edges represent the physical interactions through which an infection spreads.

The two prototype complex networks, WS graph and BA graph, can be constructed

as follows.

WS graph: Starting with a ring of N vertices, each connected to its 2K nearest

neighbors by undirected edges, and then each local link is visited once with the

rewiring probability p it is removed and reconnected to a randomly chosen node.

Duplicate and self-connected edges are forbidden. After the whole sweep of the

entire network, a small-world graph is constructed with an average connectivity
hki = 2K (in the present work we will consider the parameters N = 105, p = 0.1

and K = 5).

BA graph: Starting from a small number m0 of nodes, every time step a new

vertex is added, with m links that are connected to an old node i with probability

Πi =

ki
Pj kj

,

(1)

where ki is the connectivity of the ith node. After iterating this scheme a sufﬁcient

number of times, we obtain a network composed by N nodes with connectivity
distribution P (k) ∼ k−3 and average connectivity hki = 2m (in the present work
we will consider the parameters N = 105, m0 = 10 and m = 5).

In our model, an individual is described by a single dynamical variable adopting

one of the two stages: susceptible and infected. The two states completely neglect

3

the details of the infection mechanism within each individual. The transmission of

the disease is described in an effective way with the following rules: A susceptible

individual at time t will pass to the infected state with the rate ν at time t + ∆t if it is

connected to one or more infected individuals, where ∆t is the time step of Monte

Carlo (MC) simulations. Infected individuals at time t will pass to the susceptible

state again with the rate δ at time t + ∆t + τI, where τI denotes the delay time in

the infected phase. Here, an effective spreading rate λ = ν/δ is deﬁned. We can

still keep the generality by setting δ = 1. Individuals run stochastically through the

cycle, susceptible → infected → susceptible.

In the present work, we have performed MC simulations of the model with syn-

chronously updating in the network. Initially, the number of infected nodes is 5

percent of the size of the network. The total sampling times are 10000 MC time

steps. After appropriate relaxation times, the systems stabilize in a steady state.

Simulations were implemented on the networks averaging over 100 different real-

izations. Given a network, an important observable is the prevalence ρ, which is the

time average of the fraction of infected individuals reached after a transient from the

initial condition (averaging over 1000 time steps in this context). The information

on the global spreading of infected diseases is contained in the function ρ(λ, τI ).

3 Uniform delay

We ﬁrstly consider that all the individuals in the network have an uniform delay

τ i
I = τ,

(1)

that is to say, the details of the delay mechanism within individuals are independent

of the connectivity ﬂuctuations of the networks.

In our simulations, the system

stabilizes in dynamic equilibrium after appropriate relaxation times.

WS and ρ versus 1/λ in the BA networks are shown. In the case of τ = 0, the model

becomes the standard SIS model and the dynamic properties on both networks have

been studied in detail by Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani.[8] In the presence of time

delay (τ = 2, 4, 6), one can easily ﬁnd that the epidemic prevalence in steady

state increases, which induce the epidemic threshold λc to becomes smaller in the

WS network and the scaling effect to become weaker in the BA network. In Fig.

2 we plot ρ versus τ in the WS and BA networks under different values of the

spreading rate λ. Consistently, the epidemic prevalence in steady state increases

with the enhancement of the value of delay time. To ﬁnd the relation between the

epidemic threshold and the delay in the WS network, we plot λc as a function of

τ in Fig. 3. Closed squares represent the numerical results and the solid line is
a ﬁt to the form λc(τ ) ∼ a + be−τ /τ0, which implies there is a relation of the ﬁrst

order exponential decay between λc and τ . Parameters values (given by simulations)

a = 0.0113 ± 0.0007, b = 0.0713 ± 0.002, and τ0 = 2.14 ± 0.02.

4 Degree-dependent delay

In all the simulations above, we take homogeneous individual activities in the net-

works, i.e., the delay is identical for each individual during the evolution of the

system. However, considering the heterogeneousness of networks, the distribution

of the connectivity, we suggest a degree-dependent delay form

τ i
I =

k−α
i
α

(2)

where ki is the degree of node i and α is a tunable parameter. In Eq. (2), the delay

time is inversely proportional to ki, in other words, the larger degree a node has, the

smaller the delay time the node takes. In language of sociology, ki represents the

degree of the activity of an individual. So active individuals are easier to be found

if they are infected and it will take less time for them to become susceptible again.

Here, the details of the recovery mechanism within each individual are completely

neglected.

We perform simulations of the model with the same rule and the system reaches a

dynamic equilibrium after an initial transient. In Fig. 4, under the different values of

α, the plots of ρ versus λ in the WS and ρ versus 1/λ in the BA networks are shown.

With the reducing of the tunable parameter, the epidemic threshold λc becomes

smaller in the WS network and the scaling effect become weaker in the BA network.

The results are qualitatively consistent with the case of uniform delay since the value

of delay time is inverse proportional to the tunable parameter α (see Eq. (2)). At

the end, the plot of epidemic threshold λc as a function of α in the WS network is

shown in Fig. 5. Closed squares represent the numerical results and the solid line

is a ﬁt to the form λc(α) ∼ c + dα which predicts the linear property. Parameters

values (given by simulations) c = −0.010 ± 0.002, d = 0.37 ± 0.01.

5 Conclusions

We have investigated the spread of infectious diseases with time delay in complex

networks. The delay effect is presented in the infected phase of the standard SIS

model. Both the uniform and degree-dependent delays are considered during the

contagion process. It was found that the existence of delay will enhance both out-

breaks and prevalence of infectious diseases in the networks. Our model provides a

satisfactory explanation for some spreading phenomena in social systems. However,

the results are based on numerical simulations. It deserves to make further study on

the theoretical side. Since time delay arises naturally from the kinetic theory,[16, 17]

physicists can contribute to topics related to that, such as the explanation of mutant

virus strains,[18] the modelling of the front shapes in virus infections,[19] and the

characterization of the speed of virus infections,[20] etc.

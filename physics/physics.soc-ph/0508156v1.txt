Abstract We reanalyze high resolution data from the New York Stock Exchange and ﬁnd a monotonous
(but not power law) variation of the mean value per trade, the mean number of trades per minute and
the mean trading activity with company capitalization. We show that the second moment of the traded
value distribution is ﬁnite. Consequently, the Hurst exponents for the corresponding time series can be
calculated. These are, however, non-universal: The persistence increases with larger capitalization and this
results in a logarithmically increasing Hurst exponent. A similar trend is displayed by intertrade time
intervals. Finally, we demonstrate that the distribution of the intertrade times is better described by a
multiscaling ansatz than by simple gap scaling.

markets, business and management

Understanding the ﬁnancial market as a self-adaptive,
strongly interacting system is a real interdisciplinary chal-
lenge, where physicists strongly hope to make essential
contributions [1, 2, 3]. The enthusiasm is understandable
as the breakthrough of the early 70’s in statistical physics
taught us how to handle strongly interacting systems with
a large number of degrees of freedom. The unbroken de-
velopment of this and related disciplines brought up sev-
eral concepts and models like (fractal and multifractal)
scaling, frustrated disordered systems, or far from equilib-
rium phenomena and we have obtained very eﬃcient tools
to treat them. Many of us are convinced, that these and
similar ideas and techniques will be helpful to understand
the mechanisms of the economy. In fact, there have been
quite successful attempts along this line [4, 5, 6]. An ubiq-
uitous aspect of strongly interacting systems is the lack
of ﬁnite scales. The best understood examples are second
order equilibrium phase transitions where renormalization
group theory provides a general explanation of scaling and
universality [7]. It seems that some features of the stock
market can indeed be captured by these concepts: For ex-
ample, the so called inverse cube law of the distribution of
logarithmic returns shows a quite convincing data collapse
for diﬀerent companies with a good ﬁt to an algebraically
decaying tail [8, 9].

Studies in econophysics concentrate on the possible
analogies, although there are important diﬀerences be-
tween physical and ﬁnancial systems. This is, of course,
a trivial statement – it is enough to refer to the above-
mentioned self-adaptivity, to the possibility of inﬂuencing

the system by its characterization or to the intrinsic non-
stationarity of economic processes. Here we would like to
emphasize the discrepancy in the levels of description. In
the case of a physical system undergoing a second order
phase transition, it is natural to assume scaling on pro-
found theoretical grounds and the (experimental or theo-
retical) determination of, e.g., the critical exponents is a
fully justiﬁed undertaking. There is no similar theoretical
basis for the ﬁnancial market whatsoever, therefore in this
case the assumption of power laws should be considered
only as one possible way of ﬁtting fat tailed distributions.
Also, the reference to universality should not be plausible
as the robustness of qualitative features – like the fat tail
of the distributions – is a much weaker property. There-
fore, e.g., averaging distributions over companies with very
diﬀerent capitalization is questionable. While we fully ac-
knowledge the process of understanding based on analo-
gies as an important method of scientiﬁc progress, we em-
phasize that special care has to be taken in cases where the
theoretical support is sparse. Motivated by this, the aim
of the present paper is to carry out a careful analysis of
the high resolution data of the New York Stock Exchange
with special emphasis on the eﬀects caused by the size of
the companies.

The paper is organized as follows. After the introduc-
tion of notations in Section 1, Section 2 presents the re-
sults on the capitalization dependence of various measures
of trading activity. In Section 3 we show that the distribu-
tion of the traded values is not L´evy stable as suggested
previously [10]. Consequently, the Hurst exponents of the
related time series exist, these are analyzed in Section
4. We point out, that correlations in trading activity are

2

strongly non-universal with respect to company size, and
that the Hurst exponent of the traded value depends loga-
rithmically on the mean traded value per minute. Section
5 deals with the time intervals between trades and we give
indications, that their distribution is better described by
a multiscaling ansatz than by gap scaling proposed earlier
[11]. Finally, Section 6 concludes.

1 Notations and data

For a given time window size ∆t, let the total traded value
(activity, ﬂow) of the ith stock at time t be

f ∆t
i

(t) =

Vi(n),

(1)

Xn,tn∈[t,t+∆t]
where tn is the time when the n-th transaction of the i-th
stock takes place. This corresponds to the coarse-graining
of the individual events, or the so-called tick-by-tick data.
Latter is denoted by Vi(n), this is the value traded in
transaction n and it is a product of the price p and the
traded volume of stocks ˜V ,

Vi(n) = pi(n) ˜Vi(n).

(2)

Price usually changes only a little from trade to trade,
while the number of stocks traded in consecutive deals
varies heavily. Thus, the ﬂuctuations and the statistical
properties of the traded value f (t) are basically governed
by those of ˜V . Price only serves as a conversion factor
to US dollars, that makes the comparison of stocks possi-
ble. This way, one also automatically corrects the data for
stock splits. The statistical properties (normalized distri-
bution, correlations, etc.) are otherwise practically indis-
tinguishable between traded volume and traded value.

As the source of empirical data, we used the TAQ
database [12] which records all transactions of the New
York Stock Exchange in the years 1993 − 2003.

Finally, we note that throughout the paper we use 10-

base logarithms.

traded continuously at NYSE for the year 2000. This gives
us a range of approximately 106 . . . 6 · 1011 USD in capi-
talization.

Following Ref. [13], we quantify the dependence of trad-
ing activity on company capitalization Ci. Mean value per
trade hVii, mean number of trades per minute hNii and
mean activity (traded value per minute) hfii are plotted
versus capitalization in Fig. 1. Ref. [13] found that all three
quantities have power law dependence on Ci, however, this
simple ansatz does not seem to work for our extended
range of stocks. While mean trading activity can be ap-
proximated as hfii ∝ C0.98±0.06
to an acceptable quality,
neither hV i nor hN i can be ﬁtted by a single power law
in the whole range of capitalization. Nevertheless, there
is – not surprisingly – a monotonous dependence: higher
capitalized stocks are traded more intensively.

i

One can gain further insight from Fig. 2, which shows,

that for the largest 1600 stocks

hVii ∝ hNiiβ

(3)

with β = 0.57 ± 0.09. The estimate based on the results
of Zumbach [13] for the stocks in London’s FTSE-100, is
β ≈ 1.

For the smaller stocks there is no clear tendency. This
eﬀect can be interpreted as follows. Smaller stocks are
exchanged infrequently, however there is a smallest ex-
changed value that is still proﬁtable to use due to trans-
action costs. On the other hand, once a stock is exchanged
more frequently (the crossover happens at about hN i =
0.05 trades/min), it is no more traded in this ”minimal”
unit. With the growing speed of trading, trades tend to
”stick together”, it is possible to exchange larger pack-
ages. This increase is clear, but not dramatic, it is up to
one order of magnitude. Although increasing package sizes
reduce transaction costs, price impact [14, 15, 16, 17] in-
creases, possibly decreasing proﬁts and thus limiting pack-
age sizes. The interplay of these two eﬀects has a role in
the formation of relationship (3).

2 Capitalization and basic measures of
trading activity

Many previous studies of trading focus on the stocks of
large companies. These certainly have the appealing prop-
erty that price and returns are well deﬁned even on short
time scales due to the high frequency of trading. Never-
theless, other quantities regarding the activity of trading,
such as traded value/volume or the number of trades can
be deﬁned, even for those stocks where they are zero for
most of the time. In this section we extend the study of
Zumbach [13] which concerned companies of the top two
orders of magnitude in capitalization at the London Stock
Exchange. Instead, we analyze the 3347 stocks1 that were
1 Note that many minor stocks do not represent actual com-
panies, they are only, e.g., preferred class stocks of a larger
enterprise.

3 Traded value distributions revisited

The statistical properties of the trading volume of stocks
has previously been investigated in Ref. [10]. That work
ﬁnds that the cumulative distribution of traded volume in
∆t = 15 minute windows has a power-law tail with a tail
exponent λ = 1.7 ± 0.1. This is the so called inverse half
cube law. Formally, this corresponds to

P∆t(f ) ∝ f −(λ+1),
(4)
where P∆t is the probability density function of traded
volume (value) on a time scale ∆t.

Ever since, great eﬀort was devoted to explain this ex-
ponent in terms of the inverse cube law of stock returns
[8, 14, 15]. However, the exact distribution and the possi-
ble exponents are still much debated [16, 18].

The estimation of the tail exponent is a delicate mat-
ter. Following the methodology of Ref. [10] – and for the

same 1994 − 1995 period of data – we repeated these mea-
surements. Our results for the ∆t = 15 min distribution
are shown in Fig. 3 for three majors stocks. The tails of
these distributions can be ﬁtted by a power law over an
order of magnitude, for the top 5 − 10% of the events. The
exponent λ we ﬁnd, is signiﬁcantly higher than 1.7, it is
around 2.2 for these examples.

For systematic calculations of λ, there is a range of
mathematical tools available. We used three variants of
Hill’s method [19, 20] to estimate the tail exponent, details
can be found in Appendices A and B. All three have a
common parameter: the number k of largest events that
belong to the tail. The statistical weight associated with
the tail events is p = k/L, where L is the total length of
our time series. From Fig. 3 one can see, that p ≈ 5−10% is
the proper choice as a threshold for the asymptotic regime.
For the two-year period 1994 − 1995 and separately
for the single year 2000, we took the 1000 stocks with the

windows, divided by the mean. The plot displays three example
stocks for the period 1994 − 1995. The numbers show some

highest total traded value in the TAQ database. We de-
trended their trading activity by the well known U -shaped
intraday pattern (see, e.g., Ref. [21]). Then, we calculated
the distribution of λ over these stocks. The median and
the width of this distribution (characterized by the half
distance of the 25% and 75% quantiles) is shown in Ta-
bles 1 and 2 for various time windows ∆t.

The choice p = 0.06 in Hill’s method provides results
in line with Ref. [10]. For ∆t = 15 min time windows, one
ﬁnds λ = 1.71 ± 0.20 for the period 1994 − 1995. However,
other estimates are signiﬁcantly higher, λ > 2. Moreover,
two estimators show a strong tendency of increasing λ
with increasing time windows. Monte Carlo simulations on
surrogate datasets show, that this is beyond what could
be explained by decreasing sample size. It is well known,
that for λ < 2 the distribution would have to converge to

4

the corresponding Levy distribution when ∆t → ∞. The
measured λ’s should also be independent of ∆t. On the
other hand, for λ > 2, the ∆t → ∞ limit distribution is
a Gaussian. Accordingly, for ﬁnite samples, the measured
eﬀective value of λ increases with ∆t.

One must keep in mind, that all three methods assume
that the variable is asymptotically distributed as (4) and
none of them proves it. If this does not hold, then the
estimates of exponents are only a parametric characteri-
zation of the unknown functional form, nevertheless, they
do suggest that the second moments exist. If the distri-
bution is indeed of the limiting form (4), then although
for short time windows (∆t < 60 min) there is a fraction
of stocks whose estimate gives λ < 2, even those display
λ > 2 for larger ∆t.

Based on these results we conclude that the second
moments of the distrbution exists for large enough ∆t,
therefore the calculation of the Hurst exponent for the
related time series is meaningful.

4 Non-universality of correlations in traded
value time series

Scaling methods [22, 23, 24] have long been used to char-
acterize a wide variety of time series, including stock prices
and trading volumes [4, 5]. In particular, the Hurst expo-
nent H(i) is usually calculated. For the traded value time
series f ∆t

(t) of stock i, it is deﬁned as

where the average is taken over the time variable t. As
discussed in Sec. 3, the variance on the left hand side exists
for any stock or time scale ∆t.

(cid:11)(cid:1)

Ref. [10] ﬁnds strong correlations in

(t) with H ≈
0.83. Their analysis comprises the 1000 largest companies
in the period 1994 − 1995 and they use ∆t > 1 day except
for some very frequently traded stocks.

p

i

We extend these measurements to all 2647 stocks that
were continuously traded in the period 2000 − 2002. The
time series display a crossover from a lower to a higher
value of H(i) around the time scale of one day (for an ex-
ample, see the inset of Fig. 4). A similar eﬀect was reported
for intertrade times of large companies [11]. Intraday cor-
relations are not meaningful for some of the smallest com-
panies as their shares are often not exchanged for several
days. Nevertheless, for any choice of time windows, one
recovers a tendency: With the change of average traded
value hfii, there is a clear logarithmic trend in the Hurst
exponent, especially above the daily scale:

H(i) = H(i = 1) + γ log hfii ,

(6)

where normalization is so that hfi=1i = 1. Measurement
results and values of γ are given in Fig. 4. On the grounds
of a new type of scaling law [21], this eﬀect can be pre-
dicted analytically [25]. Here we only focus on the descrip-
tion of the phenomenon.

Trading activity of very small stocks shows nearly no
persistence. Even for ∆t > 1 day, H ≈ 0.5. This changes
as one moves to larger and larger companies. Their trad-
ing can be more correlated in the regime ∆t > 1 day, up
to H ≈ 0.9. This is a clear sign of non-universality. The
very nature of trading diﬀers for diﬀerent company sizes
and statistics such as ”distribution of Hurst exponents”
is meaningless. No typical value exists, the trend is sys-
tematic and continuous. As Hurst exponents are closely
related to the multifractal spectra [22, 26] of f , those can-
not be universal either. This raises doubts about an ”av-
erage multifractal spectrum” as calculated in, e.g., Ref.
[27].

Systematic dependence of the exponent of the power
spectrum of the number of trades on capitalization was
previously reported in Ref. [28], based on the study of
88 stocks. This quantity is closely related to the Hurst
exponent for the time series of the number of trades per
unit time (see Ref. [11]). Direct analysis ﬁnds a strong
dependence of the Hurst exponent of N on hN i, but no
such clear logarithmic trend as Eq. (6) [29].

Beyond the daily scale ((cid:4)) the eﬀect increases: the small-

Finally, we analyzed the intertrade interval series Ti(n =

and n + 1’th trade. Ni is the total number of trades for
stock i during the period under study.

Previously, Ref. [11] used 30 stocks from the TAQ
database for the period 1993 − 1996 and proposed that
the distribution of Ti scales with the mean hTii as

P(T, hT i) =

F (T / hT i),

and the universal scaling function F is well modeled by a

where X ≈ 0.94 and δ ≈ 0.72 for all the 30 stocks, with
some statistical deviations.

We analyzed the data by including a large number of
stocks with very diﬀerent capitalizations. First it has to
be noted that the mean intertrade interval has decreased
drastically over the years. In this sense the stock market
cannot be considered stationary for periods much longer
than one year. We analyze the two year period 1994−1995
(part of that used in Ref. [11]) and separately the single
year 2000. We use all stocks in the TAQ database with
hT i < 105 sec, a total of 3924 and 4044 stocks, respec-
tively.

In order to check the validity of the gap scaling for-
mula, we divided the stocks into two groups2 with respect
to hT i. Then, we generated the distribution of T / hT i for
the groups, a comparison for the year 2000 is shown in Fig-
ure 5. This already raises doubts about the generality of
Eq. (8): The tails of the distribution seem to possess more
weight for the group with small hT i (blue chips). The di-
rect visual comparison of these distributions is, however,
not always a reliable method to evaluate universality. In-
stead, we take a less arbitrary, indirect approach.

2 The groups were constructed to have an approximately
equal total number of trades. Small hT i (top 246 stocks): 6.48
sec < hT i < 47.8 sec (other 3797 stocks), large hT i: 47.8 sec
< hT i < 105 sec.

groups of stocks with diﬀerent mean intertrade times hT i. The
group with the most frequently traded stocks (blue chips) has
a considerably greater weight for waiting times. This implies
that the distribution P(T, hT i) may not be universal.

The consequence of the universal distribution (7) would
be that the moments of T should show gap scaling: The

Figure 8. Hurst exponents of Ti for time windows greater than
1 day, plotted versus the mean intertrade time hTii. Stocks that
are traded less frequently, show markedly weaker persistence
of T for time scales longer than 1 day. The dotted horizontal
line serves as a reference. We used stocks with hT i < 105 sec,
the sample period was 1994 − 1995.

The absence of simple universal scaling raises the ques-
tion of the capitalization dependence of the Hurst expo-
nent for the time series Ti [deﬁned analogously to Eq.
(5)]. For the restricted set studied in Ref. [11] the value
HT ≈ 0.94 ± 0.05 was suggested for window sizes that
are greater than the daily mean number of trades. Much
similarly to the case of traded value Hurst exponents an-
alyzed in Section 4, the inclusion of more stocks4 reveals
the underlying systematic non-universality. Again, less fre-
quently traded stocks appear to have weaker autocorrela-
tions as HT decreases monotonously with growing hT i.
One can ﬁt an approximate logarithmic law 5,6 to charac-
terize the trend:

HT = HT (hT i = 1) + γT log hT i ,

(10)

where γT = −0.10 ± 0.02 for the period 1994 − 1995 [see
Fig. 8] and γT = −0.08 ± 0.02 for the year 2000 [29].

6 Conclusions

In this paper we revisited some “stylized facts” of stock
market data and found in several ways alterations from
earlier conclusions. The main diﬀerence in our approach
4 For a reliable calculation of Hurst exponents, we had to
discard those stocks that had less than hN i < 10−3 trades/min
for 1994 − 1995 and hN i < 2 · 10−3 trades/min for 2000. This
ﬁltering leaves 3519 and 3775 stocks, respectively.

5 As intertrade intervals are closely related to the number of
trades per minute N (t), it is not surprising to ﬁnd the similar
tendency for that quantity [28].

6 Note that for window sizes smaller than the daily mean
number of trades, intertrade times are only weakly correlated
and the Hurst exponent is nearly independent of hT i. This is
analogous to what was seen for traded value records in Sec. 4.

The intuitive meaning of −τ (q ≫ 1) < q is simple:
Intertrade times of larger (more frequently traded) stocks
exhibit larger relative ﬂuctuations. In line with our ob-
servation from Figure 5, this diﬀerence must come from
the tail of the distribution, as the deviation becomes more
pronounced for higher moments.

was – besides the comparative application of extrapolation
techniques – the extension of the range of capitalization
of the studied ﬁrms. This enabled us to investigate the
dependence of the trading characteristics on capitaliza-
tion itself. In fact, in many cases we found fundamental
dependence on this parameter.

We have shown that trading activity hf i, the number of
trades per minute hN i and the mean size of transactions
hV i display non-trivial, but monotonous dependence on
company capitalization.

We have given evidence that the distribution of traded
value in ﬁxed time windows is not Levy stable. If a power
law is ﬁtted to the tail of the distribution, a careful analy-
sis yields to an exponent λ, which is – even for short time
windows – in most cases greater than 2, and then increases
with increasing time window indicating the existence of
the second moment of the distribution. Consequently, the
Hurst exponent H for its variance can be deﬁned and it
depends on the mean trading activity hf i as

H(i) = H(i = 1) + γ log hfii .

The mean transaction size can be ﬁtted to a power-
law dependence on the trading frequency for moderate to
large companies.

The distribution of the waiting times between trades
is better described multiscaling than by gap scaling. It
is characterized by an increase in both correlations and
relative ﬂuctuations with growing trading frequency (i.e.
increasing capitalization).

Our ﬁndings indicate that special care must be taken
when concepts like scaling and universality are applied to
ﬁnancial processes. The modeling of the market should
be extended to the capitalization dependence of the char-
acteristic quantities and this seems a real challenge at
present.

A The estimation of tail exponents λ

In the following, for every measurement we give the me-
dian estimates of λ for the 1000 stocks with highest traded
value during the investigated period. The error bars show
the half distance between the 25% and 75% quantiles of
λ.

A.1 Hill’s estimator

Hill’s estimator [19] is a statistically consistent method to
estimate the tail exponent λ from random samples taken
from a distribution that asymptotically has the power-
law form (4). The procedure ﬁrst sorts the sample f (t =
1 . . . L) in decreasing order. We are going to denote this
series by f [t], so that f [1] > f [2] > f [3] > . . . . Then,
one deﬁnes the tail of the distribution by setting an arbi-
trary number k of points to be included in the estimation
procedure. The estimate of the inverse tail exponent is

ˆλ−1(k) =

1
(k − 1)

"

k−1

#

given that k → ∞ and p = k/L → 0. If the sampled
distribution is of the form (4), then by increasing k, the
estimator converges rapidly to the actual value of λ−1.
However, in the case of traded value data, this turns out
not to be the case.

The inset of Fig. 9(a) – a so called Hill plot – shows,
that there is a systematic dependence of λ on p and no
convergence is observed. With the inclusion of less tail
events, the exponent increases sharply, beyond the λ = 2
threshold for L´evy stability. Further evidence for the lack
of L´evy stability is that on increasing the time scale ∆t,
the estimated tail exponents also increase further as shown
in Fig. 9(a).

This type of behavior is not new to mathematical statis-
tics (see, e.g., Ref. [20]). It is possible, that the distribution
decays faster than a power law and thus no ﬁnite λ exists.
Alternatively, the power law may not be centered around
zero, but instead it can be of the form

P∆t(f ) ∝ (f + f0)

−(λ+1) .

(12)

In this latter case, there is a ﬁnite λ, but as the sample size
T is usually too small, the estimator displays the above
bias. One can either try to approximate the value of f0
and shift the data accordingly, so that Hill’s estimator
converges properly, or try to ﬁnd another estimator that
is insensitive to this shifting constant.

We have tried both approaches and they yielded qual-

itatively similar results.

A.2 Shifted Hill’s estimator

One can apply Hill’s estimator to the points f [t = 1 . . . L]+
ϕ hf i, where ϕ is a constant parameter and look for a
value, where the estimator λ(k) becomes independent7
of k, i.e., Hill’s estimator truly ﬁnds a power-law decay
that is now consistent with Eq. (12). This happens, when
ϕ hf i = f0. How this shift by ϕ hf i aﬀects the Hill plots
is shown in Fig. 9(c) for the case of ∆t = 15 min. One
ﬁnds, that in this case ϕ ≈ 2.8 gives reasonable results,
while λ = 2.55 ± 0.35. One can repeat the procedure for
various time scales ∆t. The median Hill plots are shown
in Fig. 9(d), while λ(∆t) and ϕ(∆t) are given in Table 1.
Again, one ﬁnds a signiﬁcant increase of the tail exponent
with growing ∆t. This underlines our previous expecta-
tion that traded value distributions are not L´evy stable
and thus have a ﬁnite variance.

A.3 Fraga Alves estimator

A more sophisticated approach to estimate tail exponents
of distributions of the type (12), is a recent variant of Hill’s
method, proposed by Fraga Alves [20]. The algorithm is
described in detail in Appendix B and its estimates of λ
are – in an exact mathematical sense – independent of the
shift f0 present in the density function, unlike those of the
original Hill’s estimator (11).

We applied the estimator to the same dataset, the Hill
plots for ∆t = 1, 15, 60 min are shown in Fig. 9(d). What
one ﬁnds is a very diﬀerent behavior from the shifted Hill’s
estimator. The estimate of λ increases with growing p, i.e.,
the more points included. This is due to that the Fraga
Alves estimator converges much slower than Hill’s estima-
tor, and – as Fig. 9(d) and Monte Carlo simulations on
surrogate datasets indicate – it converges from below. On
7 More precisely, we increased ϕ from 0 by increments of 0.2
and looked for λ(k, ϕ) ≈ λ(ϕ). The method is very sensitive to
the proper choice of ϕ. For high values of ∆t, there is a low
number of data points, and the estimates of λ may be very
noisy. In this case we chose ϕ, where the estimate of λ is lower.

Figure 9. (a) Hill’ s estimates of λ for diﬀerent sizes of the time window with the tail probability set as p = 0.06. The
monotonous trend indicates that the distribution is not be Levy stable. The inset shows, that for ∆t = 15 min the eﬀective
tail exponent λ depends monotonously on the choice for tail probability p. Thus, Hill’s estimates are unreliable, because they
depend strongly on an arbitrary parameter. (b) Dependence of the Hill plots for ∆t = 15 min on the shifting constant ϕ. The

The values of ∆t from bottom to top: 1 min ((cid:4)), 5 min ( ), 15 min (N), 60 min (H), 120 min ((cid:7)), 390 min (⋆). One ﬁnds
λ > 2 and the strong increasing tendency in λ with ∆t implies that the distribution is not Levy stable. (d) Hill plots of the

of λ ≈ 2.

f [3] > . . . . Then, the procedure consists of the ﬁve steps
formulated below:

the other hand, setting the threshold as high as p = 0.1
may include events that no more belong to the power law
regime, which also results in a reduced, eﬀective expo-
nent due to the shape of the distribution, shown in Fig. 3.
Consequently, this method provides a lower estimate of λ.
Still, the calculated values are mostly above 2. Finally, one
must note that for ∆t ≥ 120 min, the number of points
was inadequate to provide any proper estimate at all.

B The algorithm of the Fraga Alves estimator

Ref. [20] describes a method to approximate the parameter
λ from a sample of a random variable that is asymptoti-
cally distributed as

P∆t(f ) ∝ (f + f0)−(λ+1).
First, one sorts the sample f (t = 1 . . . L) in decreasing
order. We denote this series by f [t], so that f [1] > f [2] >

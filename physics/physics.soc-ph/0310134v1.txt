The New Paradigm for Gamma Ray Bursts:
a Case of Unethical Behaviour?

A. De R´ujula

Theory Division, CERN, CH-1211 Geneva 23, Switzerland

Abstract

One might have hoped that the immediacy and completeness of scientiﬁc informa-
tion provided through the internet would have made the wrongful appropriation of
someone else’s ideas —now so easy to detect and document— a sin of the past.
Not so. Here I present evidence, which the reader should judge, of such an apparent
misconduct by Sir Martin Rees, the British Astronomer Royal, and others. Un-
ethical behaviour is not unknown in science. My sole intention is to call attention
to the problem by way of example, in an attempt to contribute to a more ethical
atmosphere, which would in my opinion be beneﬁcial to the ﬁeld.

Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.
Martin Luther King, Jr.

1 Motivation

It is often said that ‘battles between scientists are so ﬁerce... because there is so
little at stake’. This is probably true of most scientiﬁc disputes, perhaps even of
the matter I shall discuss. However, this note is less concerned with scientiﬁc
issues than with questions of academic integrity: the proper procedure by
which novel ideas may be adopted from the works of others, the appropriate
attribution of priorities, and the example to be set by those in high oﬃce —
in this instance, Sir Martin Rees, the British Astronomer Royal and Master
designate of Trinity College, Cambridge.

The issue at hand is the understanding of Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs), intense
but transient showers of high-energy photons (gamma rays) impinging upon
the upper atmosphere several times per day. GRBs were discovered in the late
60’s by the American Vela satellites and were later shown to be cosmological,

1

in the sense that the mighty engines making them are distributed roughly
uniformly throughout the visible universe.

What can these engines be and what is the mechanism by which the gamma
rays are produced? These two puzzles, often considered as among the greatest
mysteries of astrophysics, have challenged scientists for decades. Several diﬀer-
ent interpretations of GRBs —often vague and mutually incompatible models
that were provisionally accepted by most workers in the ﬁeld— have succeeded
one another to address these questions. Until recently, none of these schemes
adequately explained the data. However, I believe that recent observations
of GRBs and their theoretical interpretation are now suﬃcient to provide a
deﬁnitive paradigm. The once-mysterious engines responsible for GRBs are
nothing more than supernova explosions, and the mechanism producing the
bursts is inverse Compton scattering (ICS), the process by which high-energy
electrons strike low-energy photons, thereby uplifting their energy to that of
gamma rays, seen as GRBs 1 .

The currently best-studied theories of GRBs are the Fireball models and the
Cannonball model. The ﬁrst set of models is often considered to be the standard
model of GRBs. The second, of which I am a coauthor, is generally viewed as
heretical (to borrow a term used by one of our anonymous referees). In spite of
their similarly-sounding names, these two models are completely diﬀerent in
their basic hypothesis, in their description of the data, and in their predictions.

What I shall discuss here is not the validity of any particular model, but the
ways by which some scientists rewrite history by de-emphasizing the contribu-
tions of others relative to their own, or by imposing their own modes of thought
upon the community. I shall also pose the question of whether the main con-
cepts underlying what is very likely to become the new GRB paradigm will be
attributed to their creators. Today, because scientiﬁc articles are virtually in-
stantaneously ‘posted on the web’ in freely accessible and inviolate electronic
Archives 2 , one might naively suppose an aﬃrmative answer. But science is a
profoundly human endeavour and what may appear obvious is not always so.

Whether or not a note such as this should be posted in the Archives is a debat-
able question, alternatives to which I have discusssed with many colleagues.
But a “higher court” of science does not exist. Moreover, the Archives now
have a much greater impact than journals: it is mostly the original version

1 To be precise, these answers apply most convincingly to the best studied GRBs,
those of long duration (seconds or minutes, as opposed to fractions of a second).
2 Most articles cited here can be found in the Astrophysics or (in one case) the High-
Energy-Physics-Phenomenology section of http://www.arxiv.org/ Their numbers
(year, month, serial arrival number) are quoted in the reference list. New versions
of an article can be added to the Archives, but the older versions cannot be erased,
even if the paper is ‘withdrawn’.

of posted papers that people read, without checking the journal versions for
changes, even when the journal version is the one they quote. In my opinion,
what is freely posted in the Archives ought to be discussed in the Archives,
since it is the sole responsability of its authors.

In this note I shall focus on the mechanism producing GRBs (for which I
have no responsibility) rather than the engine generating them (for which
development I do claim a shared responsibility). This gives me the beneﬁt of
a somewhat wider perspective.

2 Facts

By facts I mean the statements itemized below, in which all of the quotations
are copied from the Archives on the web.

• In an article posted on the web on 14 July, 1994, Nir Shaviv and Arnon Dar
[1] argued persuasively that ICS is the mechanism underlying GRB generation.
I quote from their abstract: “Striking similarities exist between high energy
gamma ray emission from active galactic nuclei and GRBs. They suggest that
GRBs are generated by inverse Compton scattering from highly relativistic
electrons in transient jets. Such jets may be produced along the axis of an
accretion disk formed around stellar black holes (BH) or neutron stars (NS)
in BH-NS and NS-NS mergers and in accretion-induced collapse of magnetized
white dwarfs or NSs in close binary systems” 3 . The emphasis is mine. In this
article Shaviv & Dar predicted what would be a tell-tale signature of the ICS
mechanism: a very large polarization of the gamma-rays of a GRB 4 .

• It is diﬃcult to measure the degree of polarization of the gamma-rays of a
GRB. Very recently, however, the RHESSI satellite (whose primary purpose
is to study the Sun) succeeded in measuring [5] the polarization of a GRB 5 .
The result is Π = 80 ± 20%. That is, the gamma ray polarization is virtually
complete, as predicted by Shaviv & Dar.

• From the 90’s and until most recently, the generally-accepted paradigm
[8–11] for the mechanism generating GRBs was synchrotron radiation: light

3 The quoted production mechanisms are those thought to give rise to “Type Ia”
supernovae. Our current contention is that these supernovae are responsible for
short-duration GRBs [2].
4 Shaviv & Dar state that ICS was ﬁrst discussed as a mechanism for GRB pro-
duction by Shemi [3], but in the context of (spherical) ﬁreballs, in which there is no
expected polarization. Actually, ICS was discussed earlier by Zdziarski et al. [4].
5 The data analysis has been criticised [6] and defended [7].

emitted by electrons moving in a magnetic ﬁeld 6 . Nonetheless, at the time
(1994), Shaviv & Dar discussed, both in person and by mail, their then novel
idea —ICS by narrow jets ejected in stellar processes— with Martin Rees, who
kindly pointed to them a typograﬁcal error in a calculation they had originally
quoted and used.

• In an article posted on the web on August 14th, 2003 [2], Dar and I in-
corporated in detail the idea of ICS into the Cannonball model of GRBs [15],
which we have developed in collaboration with Shlomo Dado [16,17]. The large
polarization it entails is but one of the many successes of the model. Not sur-
prisingly, in that paper [2] we provide ample reference to the original idea of
Shaviv & Dar. On the GRB-generating mechanism, we say in the introduction:
“The gamma-rays of a GRB may not be produced by synchrotron radiation
and their polarization may not necessarily imply a strong, large-scale, ordered
magnetic ﬁeld in their source. In fact, Shaviv and Dar (1995) suggested that
highly relativistic, narrowly collimated jets ... may produce cosmological GRBs
by inverse Compton scattering (ICS) of stellar light”.

♠ In an article posted on the web on September 1st, 2003 [18], Rees and
his junior collaborators state: “In this paper we show that the detection of a
high level of linear polarization does not necessarily imply that the gamma-ray
photons are produced by synchrotron... Compton (Thomson) scattering of pho-
tons can, under the appropriate observing geometry, produce highly polarized
radiation”. These statements are very similar to those of the previous item.

♠♠ Even clearer is the attribution by Rees and collaborators, in the same
article [18], of the idea that Compton scattering is the GRB-generating mech-
anism. They write: “The possibility that the gamma-ray photons in the prompt
phase of GRBs are due to the bulk Compton up-scatter of UV ﬁeld photons was
ﬁrst discussed by Lazzati et al. (2000; see also Ghisellini et al. 2000)”. The
emphasis is mine and the quoted papers [19,20] are also by Rees and collabo-
rators. The basic idea was not “ﬁrst discussed” by them, but was thoroughly
studied nine years earlier by Shaviv & Dar. This fact cannot have escaped their
attention, for they cite our recent paper [2], though in a disparaging manner:
“For Γ >∼ 10 the curves are indistinguishable and can be approximated with Eq.
1 with an accuracy of 2% for Γ = 10 and 0.1% for Γ ≥ 100 (see also Dar & De
Rujula 2003, who consider only this limiting case)” 7 . Rees and collaborators
neglect to inform the reader that Γ ≥ 100 is the only relevant case, even for

6 Synchrotron radiation can produce a large polarization, but only under the most
unrealistic circumstances. In my opinion, this is what recent articles on the subject
show [12–14], although it is not what they say.
7 The electrons’ Lorentz factor is Γ ≡ 1/p1 − v2/c2. In ICS, the energy of the
struck photon is uplifted by a factor that can reach a maximum of 2 Γ2. The Eq. 1
of [18] is Eq. 28 of Shaviv & Dar, written in its more precise form. It also appears in
this form as Eq. 19 in [2], and in many standard books on quantum electrodynamics.

their analysis 8 .

♠♠♠ In their paper of the year 2000 [19], Rees and collaborators state:
The Compton drag eﬀect has already been invoked for GRBs by Zdziarski et
al. (1991) [4] and Shemi (1994) [3]... none of these scenarii was able to ac-
count for all the main properties of GRBs. They do not quote the work of
Shaviv & Dar (1995), which they would have no good reason to dismiss. By
September 2003, as we have seen, Rees and collaborators refer to the Comp-
ton mechanism as something that they ‘ﬁrst discussed’. One of the very many
reasons [2] making this mechanism so compelling in comparison to any others
is the observation of a high polarization, a result announced on the web in
May 2003 [5].

• Is the behavioural pattern described above unusual in the ﬁeld? No. In
the concluding section of Dar & De R´ujula [2], after itemizing many similar
grievances, we dare to state: “The Cannonball model [ours] may of course
be wrong, but it is successful. It is not at all inconceivable that the Fireball
models [theirs] continue to incorporate and “standardize” other aspects of the
Cannonball model”. In Section 19.1 we referred more speciﬁcally to the earlier
work of Rees et al. [19] in which they ‘ﬁrst discuss’ the ICS mechanism: “The
authors noticed that, for a large Γ, the characteristic GRB energies could be
explained (Shaviv & Dar 1995); but —perhaps because at the time ﬁreball ejecta
were still considered to be broad and to point at the observer— they overlooked
the crucial prediction of Shaviv and Dar: a large polarization”. This time Rees
and collaborators [18] no longer missed that crucial prediction [1].

3 Later and earlier developments

On September 3rd, 2003, Dar sent an e-mail to Rees, the senior author of the
above appropriation of ideas, expressing his surprise and stating: “With due
respect, Sir Martin Rees, I think that your position as the Royal Astronomer
of Britain requires setting an example of proper scientiﬁc conduct and more
responsibility . I expect you to withdraw your paper and I expect an apology.”
Rees answered promptly, saying that “when we revise our paper we will add a
reference to your 1995 paper and change the wording of our comment on your
2003 preprint”.

8 The deviations from the approximate result are of order 1/Γ2: it is not necessary
to draw curves to convince oneself that, even for Γ = 10, the precision of the
approximation is more than suﬃcient. Moreover, for low Γ, other uncertainties are
crucial, e.g. the directional distribution of target photons. Thus, in my opinion,
these calculations in [18] are not only unnecessary, but also misleading.

5

The response of Rees is inadequate. There is a clear diﬀerence between inad-
vertently forgetting a relevant reference and knowingly attributing someone
else’s ideas to oneself, while paraphrasing the original authors’ principal hy-
pothesis, conclusions and results. No one, least of all the Astronomer Royal,
should feel licensed to write a paper [18] in which (at least in the original ver-
sion posted in the web) the ideas of others are simply appropriated. Even if
this incorrect attribution of authorship were a momentary lapse, any respon-
sible researcher, having written such a paper, should be apologetic and glad to
withdraw it or —at the very least— to correct its posted version inmediately.
The response of Rees to Dar is not the solution but a further symptom of the
problem. Thus, on September 4th, 2003, I sent Rees a strongly-worded e-mail
asking him for an apology (which Dar did not obtain) and again requesting
that the article be withdrawn. A copy of the message was sent to Rees by
registered mail a few days later. I have had no response. As I wrote to Rees,
I am left with no choice but to make this issue public.

Fearing a serious clash between astronomers (Rees) and particle physicists
(me), a common friend of ours wrote to Rees expressing his concerns. Rees, in
his very kind answer (which I was explicitly allowed by Rees to see), writes:
“It’s very likely that the paper will need revising on the basis of referee’s com-
ments. Indeed it may of course be rejected – and undoubtedly will be if Dar
and de Rujula’s assessment is well-based”. I disagree with this transfer of re-
sponsibility to an anonymous referee. It is the duty of the authors and of the
editor, who in this case had been informed of the issue. By October 2nd the
paper [18] had been accepted, with the proviso that proper references be given.
That will not aﬀect the subsequent attribution of the original ideas by other
workers in the ﬁeld, particularly since, to date, the original version of [18] is
still the only one posted on the web.

Let me give three other pertinent instances of inadequate citation. When the
gamma-ray signal of a GRB is over, the event is not. The GRB is followed
by an afterglow (AG). That is, the source continues to shine photons of lower
energy, and remains observable for a very long time. GRB afterglows have
been observed at many frequencies, from X-rays to visible light, to radio. As
far as I know, the ﬁrst prediction of AGs is due to Jonathan Katz [21–23], who
wrote: “The debris’ energy degrades. Its radiation shifts to lower frequencies
and increases in duration, and may be observable at frequencies from X-rays
down to radio.” 9 The predicted AGs were discovered in 1997 [25] and have
played a crucial role in the understanding of GRBs. However, the prediction
of AGs is systematically attributed to M´esz´aros and Rees [26], who, some
four years after Katz, wrote: “We ﬁnd that the resulting cosmological GRB
remnants ... produce signiﬁcant ﬂuxes of softer radiation, mostly X-rays and

9 Paczynski & Rhoads [24] independently predicted a radio AG, analogous to that
of SN remnants.

optical, but in some cases radio as well”. These authors do cite Katz [21,23],
not for the prediction of AGs (which is what M´esz´aros and Rees allege to
make), but in a collective reference unrelated to AGs. In this case, peer review
did not ensure that the earlier work of Katz was properly aknowledged.

The self-attribution by Rees and collaborators of ICS as the GRB-generating
mechanism and of the subsequent polarization has born fruit, for they are
already quoted in the literature for both items. For instance, Sikora et al. [27],
state: “Proposed scenarios include... and Compton scattering... (Lazzati
et al. 2000 [19] and references therein). If the polarization measured by the
RHESSI satellite is real... the Compton mechanism can still work (... Lazzati
et al. 2003 [18]), provided that the jet has an opening angle < 1/Γ.”

Incidentally, the last-cited condition is a complete novelty in Fireball models,
while it is satisﬁed by construction in the [uncited] Cannonball model, in which
the only relevant angle is the observer’s viewing angle. To accommodate the
data, the original spherical “Fireball” models had to evolve into “Firecone”
models [28,29]. Firecones were to emit gamma rays as idealized torches, that
is, within a cone with a given “jet” opening angle. For years, these models were
anthropoaxial: the observer was placed exactly on the axis of the cone. In Dado
et al. 2002 [16], we criticized this improbable hypothesis. Subsequently, in a
handful of papers, one of them by Rees and collaborators [30], the relevance
of the viewing angle was at last recognized by the GRB community. We were
not cited in any of those papers for this trivial but crucial point 10 .

4 In lieu of a conclusion

I have felt obliged to describe several instances of what appears to me to be
unethical behaviour on the part of Rees and others. Whether or not this be-
haviour is plagiarism may be a matter of opinion. Alas, this kind of behaviour
is not exceptional in the ﬁeld, as we have already documented in Dar & De
R´ujula [2], particularly in the conclusions and in an appendix on the history
of the contention that supernovae are the engines of GRBs.

(Dated: January 5, 2014)

The data presented here show that human drivers apply a discrete noisy control mechanism to
drive their vehicle. A car-following model built on these observations, together with some physical
limitations (crash-freeness, acceleration), led to non-Gaussian probability distributions in the speed
diﬀerence and distance which are in good agreement with empirical data. All model parameters
have a clear physical meaning and can be measured. Despite its apparent complexity, this model
is simple to understand and might serve as a starting point to develop even quantitatively correct
models.

INTRODUCTION

Modelling the process by which a driver controls her
vehicle has been done since 1950. So far, no commonly
agreed model has been emerged. Even worse, the advent
of the cellular automaton models (see [1] for a review)
has sparked a burst of new models trying to describe (at
least) the car following process of one car driving behind
another one.

Most driving models assume (for reviews see [2, 3, 9])
an instantaneous or even delayed reaction of the driver
to the surrounding situation, i.e. the driving law can be
formulated as a stochastic diﬀerential equation (SDE):

˙v = A(g, v, V ) + D(g, v, V )ξ.

(1)

Here, g is the headway to the vehicle in front (distance
from front bumper of the following vehicle to the head
bumper of the lead vehicle), v is the speed of the following
car, V the speed of the leading car, ξ is a noise term which
is restricted in size (acceleration is limited, and so is the
noise), and A(·) and D(·) are two functions describing
the reaction of the human driver to the situation in front
of her vehicle.

Obviously, an equation like this one ignores two im-
portant features of human driving and of human actions
in general. Firstly, humans usually plan ahead, and sec-
ondly, the type of control humans apply is not continu-
ous, but discrete in time: they act only at certain mo-
ments in time. These speciﬁc moments have been named
action-points [4, 5], a name that will be used in the fol-
lowing.

While the second assumption can be proven by
analysing data from car-following experiments, see Fig. 1,
the ﬁrst assumption has to be classiﬁed as a conjecture.
Strictly speaking, there is no way of actually observing
this planning process. The best that can be done is to
ﬁnd examples in data for such a planning. One interest-
ing place where this can be observed is a courtesy lane
change at freeway entrances; another one is the advance
braking in front of a red traﬃc light. In Fig. 2, an exam-
ple for the latter behaviour is presented. Here, the accel-
eration times series of three vehicles are shown, with the

following vehicles reacting before or in synchrony with
the lead car. Of course, both types of behaviours contra-
dict the assumption of an instantaneous driving law, i.e.
Eq. (1).

The planning ahead may be described by a trajectory
computed in advance in the phase space (x(t), v(t), a(t))
of the following vehicle (x(t) being a position along the
road, in general it involves the lateral dynamics as welln),
i.e. including a planned velocity and acceleration time
course. First steps to formulate and analyse such models
have been put forward in [10, 11], here a more speciﬁc
example will be added.

THE DATA USED

Mainly two types of data have been used to support
the results in this article. The ﬁrst are several data-
sets from an instrumented vehicle, where speed, distance
to the leading vehicles, acceleration, the amount of gas,
viewing angle, steering angle and many more data have
been recorded with a high temporal resolution during
several drives under normal to heavy traﬃc conditions.

following vehicles (2nd and 3rd). Usually, changes in accel-
eration occur time delayed, while around time t = 1970 this

while the 3rd one brakes in synchrony with the 1st car.

about the experiments.

The second data-set is from the NGSIM project [13]
and consists of several thousand trajectories of vehicles
driving along two California freeways. The data have
been recorded by video cameras, therefore only the po-
sitions of the cars (recorded in 0.1 s resolution) are the
primary data, anything else like speeds has been com-
puted from the trajectories.

The data consist of vehicle trajectories. One may won-
der about how generic such a trajectory is, and here the
assumption is made, that any trajectory is the reaction of
a particular driver to a particular environment, and that
this reaction can be parameterized if a suitable model
of the car driving process has been found. Nevertheless,
the approach taken here focuses on more robust features,
that is, on probability distributions of various observables
instead of the observables themselves.

The most prominent distributions to study are the ones
for the acceleration p(a), the speed diﬀerences between
two vehicles p(∆v), the headway distribution p(T ), where
T = g/v is the scaled distance between the vehicles, and
the compound distribution p(∆v, T ), which is a sensitive
measure of the interaction between two vehicles.

A SIMPLE MODEL

It has been argued above that the control process ap-
plied by humans is discrete and noisy. The discrete-
ness has been demonstrated in Fig. 1. The randomness
can be seen in Fig. 3, where the distribution p(∆t) of
time intervals ∆t between subsequent action-points is
displayed. This distribution follows an exponential distri-
bution quite close, which can be understood as a simple
process:
in any instant of time the driver decides ran-
domly whether he should change acceleration or not. Of

instance by a red light.

course, there might be more sensible reasons to change
acceleration, but mainly the action-points happen more
or less without reasons, i.e. randomly.

Additionally, the randomness is not only in time, the
acceleration itself is not a very well deﬁned function of
distance and speed-diﬀerence. This can be seen from
sampling acceleration values from a small phase-space in-
terval (g ± δg/2, v ± δv/2, V ± δV /2). Three resulting dis-
tributions pg,v,V (a)δg δv δV are displayed in Fig. 4. Typ-
ically, those distribution have standard deviation around
0.4 m/s2, which will be interpreted in the following as
the acceleration noise.

g = 18 m, v = 8 m/s, V = 5 m/s
g = 19 m, v = 11 m/s, V = 11 m/s
g = 12 m, v = 3 m/s, V = 5 m/s

FIG. 4: The distribution of accelerations for negative speed
diﬀerence (approaching lead vehicle), zero speed diﬀerence,
and positive speed diﬀerence. Data are from ten cars on a
Japanese test track [6], with relatively small speeds. All dis-
tributions are sampled from a small phase space box of size 1
m × 1 m/s × 1 m/s and are centered on the values indicated
in the legend.

The results obtained so far therefore motivate the fol-
lowing model. At the time tn of the n-th action-point
the driver chooses a new acceleration value an according
to:

an = aopt − εaξ

(2)

Here, aopt is an optimal acceleration value to be speciﬁed
below, εa is the size of the acceleration noise and ξ is a
random number in the interval [0, 1].

After that, the driver keeps acceleration constant
(more precisely: the amount of gas, acceleration might
still change due to changing air resistance or eﬃciency
changes in the engine), so the dynamics until the next
action-points occurs follows simple laws:

v(t) = vn + an (t − tn)

x(t) = xn + vn (t − tn) +

an (t − tn)2

t ∈ [tn, tn+1]

1
2

Here, xn, vn are the values of the variables x and v at the
time of the n-th action-point. Note, that this equation
is mathematically a map. This may explain why even
simple time-discrete models (which are maps with regular
time intervals instead of the random time intervals here)
can model traﬃc ﬂow quite successfully.

As demonstrated already, the time intervals ∆t =
tn+1 − tn between the action-points are exponentially
distributed, which can be translated into a time-discrete
set-up as a certain probability pAP that an action-point
will occur in a given time-step. The action-points itself
are selected depending either on a random number drawn
in any time-step with ξ < pAP, or if the optimal accel-
eration is smaller than the current acceleration a minus
εa.

The optimal acceleration aopt can be computed by
modeling the planning process of the driver. To drive
safely during the short-term planning horizon τ , it should
be possible to safely stop the vehicle behind the lead-
ing vehicle later on. That means, that a driver chooses
the maximum acceleration aopt which fulﬁls the following
condition:

d(v + aopt τ ) + v τ +

aopt τ 2 ≤ d(V ) + g

(3)

Here, d(·) are the braking distances, by assuming a con-
stant (comfortable) deceleration b which is the same for
both drivers, this equation can be solved to yield:

(4)

This expression must be limited to a maximal accelera-
tion: for a realistic model, aopt ≤ amax(1 − v/vmax) has
to be enforced.

Taken anything together, this model has just seven
parameters: the physical limitations car-length ℓ, maxi-
mum speed vmax, and maximum acceleration amax, and
the behavioural parameters preferred deceleration b, ac-
celeration noise εa, the action point probability pAP, and
the minimum preferred headway distance τ . In principle,
the maximal possible deceleration is another physical pa-
rameter, fortunately the decelerations of the model never
reach unphysical deceleration values.

3

This concludes the deﬁnition of the model. Note, that
despite the rather complicated look of Eq. (4), its geo-
metric appearance is almost linear. Therefore it is very
likely, that humans are capable of learning at least a cer-
tain approximation to this function, no reason to do fairly
complicated math while driving.

RUNNING THE SIMULATIONS

To compare the model with the data, simulations with
N = 100 vehicles have been run, either in a loop or by
following a lead vehicle driving with constant speed. The
time-step size has been set to h = 0.2 s. Simulations with
a smaller time-step size yield the same results, which is to
be expected since the dynamical equations are the exact
solutions of the model. To use more than one vehicle
following a lead vehicle is important, since the behaviour
at the end of a platoon diﬀers from the behaviour directly
behind the lead car.

The following Figures show the results of the simula-
tion compared to the real data. First, the headway dis-
tributions p(T ) are compared. In this case, as indicated
by the semi-logarithmic plot, the distributions (simula-
tion and data) follow quite closely a gamma distribution
(p(T ) ∝ T γ exp(−T /m)). This is in agreement with the
standard assumption [7, 8]. Note however, that under
some circumstances this distribution may change into a
diﬀerent form which can be obtained by the transforma-
tion T → 1/T . This will be detailed elsewhere. Secondly,

the distribution of the speed diﬀerences is shown in Fig. 6.
Again, good agreement between simulation and reality
could be seen. The following simple consideration aids in
understanding p(∆v). Since the action-point dynamics
makes it very hard for the driver to arrive at a ﬁxed point
of the car following dynamics a = 0, ∆v = 0, g = g⋆, the
acceleration may be modelled by a simple SDE. By ig-
noring the relatively weak dynamical component in the

∆v-direction a 1D equation can be assumed:

(5)

The force on the right hand side is symmetric with re-
spect to ∆v = 0, which seems a good approximation even
for large ∆v, see again Fig. 6. The somewhat surprising
tanh(·)–nonlinearity stem from the idea, that the driver
mainly apply two acceleration values: positive ones for
positive ∆v, and negative ones for negative ∆v. Ob-
viously, this is a gross oversimpliﬁcation, which can be
justiﬁed by the result below.

The Fokker-Planck equation for the stationary phase

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

the speed diﬀerences. Albeit this particular form of the
distribution signals that ∆v = 0 is a special value, the
action-points hinder the formation of a stable ﬁxed point
of the car following process. Many models described in
the literature assume such a ﬁxed point; however most of
them can be made more realistic by adding the action-
point mechanism as described above.

More facts have been learned about the interaction be-
tween cars: ﬁrst of all, the interaction is controlled to a
large part by ∆v, the distances seem to be rather unim-
portant to the driver as long as they are in a certain com-
fortable range. This is similar to the model in [12], but
in contradiction to the so called optimal velocity mod-
els which model the interaction as a function of distance
only. Interestingly, when a vehicle is in following mode
the decelerations applied are rather small, typically the
drivers control their vehicle not by applying the brakes
but simply by stepping oﬀ the gas. This makes the distri-
bution of p(∆v) so amazingly symmetric; when switching
to a larger b in the model above, the (simulated) distri-
bution becomes asymmetric.

Let us ﬁnally speculate about why humans drive in this
manner: because it is simply much more comfortable to
mince around a preferred distance than to actually ﬁx it
completely.

Acknowledgments

Many thanks to T. Nakatsuji and his Hokkaido group
for sharing their data. The NGSIM project provided the
beautiful trajectory data-sets, which for sure will help to
advance traﬃc ﬂow research. Data of the equipped car
have been provided by J¨urgen Rataj, other data came
from the group of Michael Schreckenberg, which are ac-
knowledged here as well.

The model presented here has some limitations. For
instance, it is not completely platoon stable, i.e. in a
long platoon disturbances can amplify and ﬁnally lead
to standing vehicles. Some details of the acceleration
distribution (not shown) are not in full agreement to the
data, and the restriction to two car interactions must be
lifted, the NGSIM data for instance are from a six-lane
freeway. Another limitation is that the model described
here only models the operational driving process covering
the next two seconds or so, while nothing is done to model
tactical driving covering the next 10 seconds.

Despite these limitations, it is capable to model human
driving faithfully. It is important to recognize that the
interaction between vehicles, together with the action-
point dynamics, lead to the exponential distribution of

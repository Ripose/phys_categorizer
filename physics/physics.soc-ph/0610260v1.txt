The paper treats opinion dynamics of an unequal distribution as the initial opinion
distribution. Simulated is the Deﬀuant model on a directed Barab´asi-Albert network
with discrete opinions and several subjects. Noticed is a focusing of the the resulting
opinion distribution during the simulation towards the average value of the initial opinion
distribution. A small change of the focusing is seen. A dependency of this change on the
number of subjects and opinions is detected and indicates the change as a consequence of
discretization the opinions. Hereby the average value of the initial opinion distribution
can be identiﬁed as the guide of opinion forming.

1. Introduction

The human brain is an economically working organ. It received a lot of informations
from ’outside’ (senses) and ’inside’ (memories, associations). Not to be paralysed
by working up all informations at the same time, it follows a strategy of stepwise
reﬁnement. At the beginning it forms a ﬁrst impression, which integrates more or
less all informations. It goes on in controlling and weighting all relevant informa-
tions and summarises them. At the end stands a conclusion1.
People watching a movie or a performance, meeting another person, regarding some-
thing new, etc., do the same working method for evaluation as the brain does. At
the beginning stands a ﬁrst impression. After leaving the theater and discussing the
movie or performance, having a talk with a new acquaintance, examining the news
more closely, they form in the end, starting from the ﬁrst impression, by checking
in detail, a personal opinion.
Someone can take the ﬁrst impression as the ﬁrst truth. In discussing, talking or
examining, this ﬁrst truth will be the guide (canon) of opinion forming. This way
of giving an opinion on truth weight, has been done by Assmann 2, Krause and
Hegselmann 3, and Malarz 4.
The Deﬀuant model oﬀers a choice for reproducing this process. Therefore, suppos-
ing that the impressions of all humans are similar 5, I choose a value as the average
of all opinions of all agents. I set this value as the ﬁrst impression.
Therefore at the beginning of the simulation is a arrangement of opinions, which
gives on average the chosen value of impression.

Focusing of Opinions in the Deﬀuant-Model

2. Model

The model simulates a consensus forming process. The agents are connected via a
directed Barab´asi-Albert network 6 . The opinion exchange follows Deﬀuant et al.
7 with discrete opinions and several subjects ( = questions, themes, ... ).
Every agent i (i = 1, 2, ..., N ) has on each subject Sk (k = 1, 2, ..., S) an opinion
Ok
Simulations of a consensus model ´a la Deﬀuant on a directed Barab´asi-Albert net-
work with discrete opinions have been made with one subject in 9, with several
subjects in 10,11.

i . The discrete opinion spectrum comprises natural numbers from 1 to O.

2.1. Network assembly

At the beginning one knot of m + 1 agents, each connected with all others, is built.
Every newly added agent i connects itself with m already existing agents in the
network. The connection takes place stochastically. With it the probability of
connecting with an already existing agent is proportional to the total number of the
connections of this pre-existing agent (“The rich get richer”).
Besides the connection is directed, i.e., the agents search a partner along the m
connections, which they connect. The connections, with whom they connected
later when new agents are added, can not be chosen by themselves.

2.2. Communication

The communication takes place along the connections. The agents become the ac-
tive communicator i in the order they have been bound into the network. The
partner for communication j will be chosen randomly from the m with those to
whom i has connected itself. Then the over-all distance δ to the partner of commu-
nication will be calculated. This δ results from the absolute value of the distance
of the opinions on all subjects to each other

δ =

|Ok

i − Ok

j | ,

and is the indicator for the start of a communication: If δ is lower or equal a given
∆ = (O − 1) S ε then a communication will start (ε with 0 < ε < 1 is an input
parameter). Otherwise it is the next agents’ turn.

2.2.1. Rules for Simulating the Communication:

Now agents i and j look randomly for a subject Sk on which they will communicate.

• If the diﬀerence of opinions (Ok

the subject k results in zero, then they agree and the communication ends.

• If the diﬀerence of opinions equals one, one communicant will adopt randomly

the opinion from the other.

Focusing of Opinions in the Deﬀuant-Model

• If the diﬀerence of opinions is larger than one, both communicants approach

each other by the amount d, with rounding the opinion.
With d =

j ) , it will be Ok

i − d and Ok

j := Ok

j + d.

p
After that it is the next agents’ turn.
The simulation ends, when during n iterations over all agents no change of opinion
in one of the communications takes place.

2.3. First Impression

’First Impression’ is the initial mean opinion of all the networks agents opinions in
all subjects S. The equal distribution has the median value of the opinion-spectra
O. To realise another than the median value of the opinion-spectra O means to
start with an unequal distribution of the opinions.
This has been done by asynchronous allocation and random displacement of several
opinions.
In a second way, I choose for initializing the opinions distribution only two possible
opinions. With a probability of 50 % an agent gets for all its subjects one of these
two opinions. This way I call a symmetric distribution. I have done simulations
with 17 diﬀerent average network opinions generated by symmetric distributions.

2.4. Parameter

The parameters of the model, which have been modiﬁed, are:
∆ = (O − 1) S ε, 0 ≤ ε ≤ 1; N : Number of agents (N ); S: Number of subjects
(S); O: Number of opinions per subject (O), n: stop criterion; the simulation
stops if during n consecutive iterations over all agents no opinion was changed.
The parameter of the model, which has been held constant, is m: Number of
network neighbours (m=3).

ε: tolerance,

2.5. Methods of Evaluation

a) Average Opinion AO

The average opinion AO speciﬁes the mean of all opinions of all agents of the
network considering all their subjects.

The average opinion at the start of the simulation I call AOstart, at the end
of the simulation AOend.

b) Percentage Change P A

Before the start of the simulation, I verify the AOstart of the network. After
the stop of the simulation I calculate AOend. The diﬀerence of AOstart to

A positive sign implies, that the AOend is larger than AOstart, a negative sign
implies the reverse.

c) Standard Deviation

From the P A I calculate an average change P A of all simulations with diﬀerent
average opinions at start.
Also a standard deviation of the percentage change has been calculated. With

Fig. 2. The AOstart vs. AOend is plotted. The tendency of AOstart to remain stable is obvious.
The AOend varies in a small interval around the AOstart (with N =10003, S=10, O=10, n=1).
The graph shows AOstart vs. AOend of an unequal opinion distribution. In the inset is shown
AOstart vs. AOend of the simulations with the symmetric distribution.

3. Simulation

3.1. Description

The simulations have been made with ≃ 400 diﬀerent non-equal opinions distribu-
tions at the start. The AOend of the simulations has been nearly the same as the
AOstart (Fig. 1 and 2).
The general tendency is, that AOstart stays stable, as the initial distribution begin
changes. Changing of opinions during an iteration is mostly symmetric (see above,
2.2.1), except the second rule. Therefore with every opinion change the mean opin-
ion between acting agents stays stable, except that an agent adopts randomly the
opinion of the other agent 12.

3.2. Analysis, Standard Deviation

The percentage change P A has been calculated, as outlined (Eq. 3). The standard
deviation (Eq. 4) has been calculated on base of the average percentage change P A
of all simulations (Fig. 3 ).
Variations of ε do inﬂuence the outcome of the simulations. P A stays stable around

0, but σ is growing with growing ε until an εs from there on σ stays stable. εs is
identical with the ε where the minimal number of clusters of the network is reached
and nearly all agents share the same opinions in their subjects 10.
In a simulation with small ε only a few opinions will be changed, with growing
ε more opinions are changed. The changing are of discrete number, this could
explain the uneven curve. The variation of the stop criterion n and the variation
of the number of agents N (Fig. 3) do not obviously inﬂuence the outcome of the
simulations. But variations of the number of subjects S (Fig. 5) and the opinion
spectra O (Fig. 4) aﬀect on the outcome of the simulations.

3.2.1. Opinion Spectra

O divided by the smallest steps of modiﬁcation of the opinions during the simulation
gives the number of possible steps changing the opinion. Therefore large O oﬀers
more possible values for AO than small O, with it more possible values for AOend
near AOstart. This results in a smaller σ with larger O.

3.2.2. Number of Subjects

An increasing number of S results in more possible numerical values of the average

value and with it in more total values of AO. Therefore large S oﬀers more possible
values for AOend than smaller S. This also results in a smaller σ with larger S.

4. Conclusion

The Deﬀuant Algorithm is maintaining the average opinion of the initial opinion
distribution. The diﬀerences of the AOstart to the AOend are small 12. We can
presume the origins of this diﬀerence in the discretization of opinions. The diﬀerence
is inﬂuenced by S and O, due to the discretization.
But the most notably fact is the focus of the algorithm on the mean value of the
initial opinion distribution. For a communicative social community means this, that
the ﬁrst impression guides the opinion forming.

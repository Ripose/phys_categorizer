We review some statistical many-agent models of economic and social systems inspired by mi-
croscopic molecular models and discuss their stochastic interpretation. We apply these models to
wealth exchange in economics and study the relaxation process and how it depends on the param-
eters of the system, in particular on the saving propensity parameters that deﬁne and diversify the
agent proﬁles.

INTRODUCTION

One might question how theories which try to explain the physical world of elementary particles, atoms, and
molecules could be applied to understand the social structure in its complexity and economic behavior of human
beings: is it possible to infer the behavior of people with simple models? Is it even possible to identify and quantify
the nature of the interactions between them? Even though the answers to these questions are still on the negative
to our knowledge, during the past decade physicists have made attempts in studying problems related to Economics,
the social science that seeks to analyze and describe the production, distribution, and consumption of wealth [1].

Here, we will not try to review all these attempts, rather we brieﬂy describe a few models that we name in the
following as statistical many-agent models. In these models, economic activity is described as a ﬂow of wealth between
basic units, referred to as agents, representing e.g. companies or individuals. Each of the N agents {1, 2, . . . , i, . . . ,
N } has a wealth xi, which changes in time as agents exchange wealth between each other, according to the trading
rules detailed in Sec. II. These underlying trading rules only depend on one set of parameters, namely the saving
propensities {λi}, with 0 ≤ λi < 1. Statistical many-agent models describe closed economy systems and can reproduce
some features of wealth distributions, such as an exponential tail at intermediate values of wealth and a power law
tail. Two particular models are that with global λ and that with distributed λ’s.

If the saving propensity is equal for all the units (global saving propensity models), λi ≡ λ, the equilibrium wealth

density f (x) is given by a γ-distribution,

f (x) = β γn(βx) =

(βx)n−1 exp(−βx) ,

Here n is a real number in the interval (1, ∞] and D = 2n can be considered as the eﬀective dimension of the system:
in fact the distribution γn(βx) is just the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for the kinetic energy x of a gas in thermal
equilibrium at a temperature β−1 in a D-dimensional space. Thus the parameter β can be interpreted as the inverse
temperature: consistently with the equipartition theorem, β−1 = 2hxi/D = hxi/n, where hxi is the constant average
wealth hxi = X/N and X is the total wealth. In an economic system, temperature represents an estimate of the
ﬂuctuations of wealth around the average value. The model with a global saving propensity describes well wealth
distributions at intermediate values of x, but cannot predict power laws at large x.

If λ is uniformly distributed among the units (distributed saving propensity models) according to a given density
φ(λ), then one ﬁnds, under quite general conditions on the shape of φ(λ), an exponential law at small values of x and

with α ≥ 1. The power law was suggested by Vilfredo Pareto [2] more than a century ago to describe the tail of
wealth distributions and is usually found to be characterized by a Pareto exponent α ≈ 3/2 across various economies.

exchange laws of the latter models with distributed λ and study its dependence on the saving propensity distribution
φ(λ) through some examples. We also consider the corresponding relaxation time distributions and discuss the relation
between the Pareto exponent and the relaxation behavior of the system. Results are summarized in Sec. IV.

II. MANY-AGENT MODELS OF A CLOSED ECONOMY

Our aim is to study a general many-agent statistical model of closed economy (analogous to the kinetic theory
model of ideal gases, see Fig. 1), where N agents exchange a quantity x, that we have deﬁned as wealth. The states
of the agents are speciﬁed only by the wealths {xi}, while the total wealth X = Pi xi is conserved. The evolution
of the system is carried out according to the following algorithm: at every time step two agents i and j are chosen
randomly and an amount of wealth ∆x is exchanged, so that the agent wealths x′

j after the transaction are

i and x′

Diﬀerent transaction rules have been studied by various authors analytically or numerically and are summarized here
below.

A. Basic model without saving: Boltzmann distribution

A stochastic trading rule, which redistributes the wealths of two agents randomly, was introduced in Refs. [5],

x′
i = xi − ∆x ,
x′
j = xj + ∆x .

x′
i = ǫ(xi + xj) ,
x′
j = ¯ǫ(xi + xj) ,

where ǫ is a uniform random number in (0, 1) and ǫ + ¯ǫ = 1. Equations (5) are equivalent to the trading rule (4)
if ∆x = ¯ǫxi − ǫxj . In another version of the model, the money diﬀerence ∆x is assumed to have a constant value
independent of the two trading agents [6–8], i.e. ∆x = ∆x0. Both these forms for ∆x lead to a robust equilibrium
Boltzmann distribution,

with eﬀective temperature β−1 = hxi = X/N [5–8].

f (x) = β−1 exp(−βx) ,

B. Model with global saving propensity: Gamma distribution

Introducing a saving criterion through a saving propensity parameter 0 < λ < 1 [3, 4, 9, 10] modiﬁes the trading

rule as follows,

x′
i = λxi + ǫ(1 − λ)(xi + xj ) ,
x′
j = λxj + ¯ǫ(1 − λ)(xi + xj) .

∆x = (1 − λ)[¯ǫxi − ǫxj] .

This is actually a particular case of the model of John Angle [3, 4], but for the sake of simplicity we will study this
trading rule and its generalizations for the following considerations on the relaxation process. This rule corresponds
to the process deﬁned by Eq. (4) if

The parameter λ represents the fraction of wealth saved before the reshuﬄing takes place and produces a qualitatively
diﬀerent equilibrium distribution, namely the gamma distribution (1) [11, 12] with mode xm > 0 and a zero limit for
x → 0, see Fig. 2.

exponential curve λ = 0 is the equilibrium solution for the basic model (Sec. II A), while the other curves correspond to a
nonzero global saving propensity (Sec. II B).

C. Models with a continuous distribution of saving propensity

More realistic and interesting models are obtained when agents are diversiﬁed by assigning diﬀerent saving propen-

sities λi [13–20], e.g. the λi are uniformly distributed in the interval (0, 1]. The trading rule is then

or, equivalently, can be formulated through Eq. (4), in which a ∆x is given by

x′
i = λixi + ǫ[(1 − λi)xi + (1 − λj )xj ] ,
x′
j = λjxj + ¯ǫ[(1 − λi)xi + (1 − λj )xj] ,

∆x = ¯ǫ(1 − λi)xi − ǫ(1 − λj)xj .

Numerical simulations and theoretical considerations suggest that these models relax toward a robust power-law
1/x1+α with a Pareto exponent α = 1 in the case of uniformly distributed λ and with α > 1 if the λ-density φ(λ)
goes to zero as φ(λ) ∼ (1 − λ)α−1 for λ → 1. In the following we concentrate on the relaxation process of this latter
model.

III. RELAXATION PROCESS

4

If a real economic system is characterized by a certain shape of wealth distribution, it is then of great interest to
know on which time scale the system relaxes toward such distribution and how the relaxation process depends on the
system parameters, in particular on the saving propensity distribution.

A. Relaxation to equilibrium versus system size

Before analyzing the dependence of the time scale on the saving propensity distribution, we shortly consider its
dependence on the number of agents N . We ﬁnd that the time scale is proportional to the number of agents N : a
system A which is m times larger than a system B (NA = mNB) relaxes m times slower than B, if time is measured
in single transactions. This is shown in Fig. 3, where the average wealth hx(t)iλ of the agent subset with λ = 0.99 is
plotted versus the rescaled time t/N for various systems with diﬀerent N ’s. The λ-density φ(λ) is always the same
however and uniformly partitions the global system into 100 subsets with λ = 0.01, 0.02, . . . , 0.99.

FIG. 3: Average wealth hx(t)iλ=0.99 versus the rescaled time t/N for systems with diﬀerent number of agents N = 100,
1000, and 10000 but the same saving propensity density φ(λ), which uniformly partitions agents into 100 subsets with λ =
0.01, 0.02, . . . , 0.99.

The previous considerations suggest the introduction of a time unit τ0, such that during any time interval (t, t + τ0)
all agents perform on average one trade (or the same number of trades). In this way the dynamics and the relaxation
process become independent of N . The existence of a natural time scale independent of the system size provides
a foundation for using simulations of systems with ﬁnite N in order to infer properties of systems with continuous
saving propensity distributions and N → ∞. Here and in the following we redeﬁne time by scaling it through the
total number of agents N . Our original Monte Carlo-like numerical procedure (in which time is given by the number
of trades) is thus turned into a molecular dynamics-like simulation (in which all agents perform on average one trade
during a single time step).

Here and in the simulations presented below all agents start from the same initial wealth xi(t = 0) = x0 = 1.
The value x0, due to the conservation of x, also represents the global average value of x at any time t, i.e., hx(t)i ≡
R dx f (x)x = x0. These particular initial conditions are not as restrictive as it may seem at ﬁrst sight, since in a
general situation agents do not start with a wealth exactly equal to the ﬁnal equilibrium value.

B. Relaxation to equilibrium versus saving propensity

As discussed in Refs. [18, 21, 22], the partial wealth distributions of agents with a given value of λ, in a model
with distributed λ, relax toward diﬀerent states with characteristic shapes fλ(x) of the wealth probability density.
Each function fλ(x) has a maximum and an exponential tail, thus closely recalling the shape of a γ-distribution, the
corresponding average value being hxiλ = k/(1 − λ), where k is a suitable constant. However, at large values of x the
mixture of all the partial distributions results in the Pareto law f (x) = Pλ fλ(x) ∼ 1/x1+α.

We study now how the relaxation process of agents with a given λ toward the corresponding equilibrium density
fλ(x) depends on λ. Numerical simulations clearly show that agents with diﬀerent λ are associated to diﬀerent
relaxation times τλ. This is illustrated in Fig. 4 for a system of N = 104 agents uniformly partitioned into 100 subsets

(1 − λ), inversely proportional to the mean wealth and proportional to the average wealth exchange rate.

with λ = 0.01, 0.02, . . . , 0.99: mean wealths of subsets corresponding to values of λ closer to one relax slower, toward
their asymptotic average wealths hxiλ ∝ 1/(1 − λ).

The average wealth x0 allows the introduction of a threshold partitioning the system into poor agents, with an
asymptotic average wealth hx(t → ∞)iλ < x0, and rich agents with hx(t → ∞)iλ > x0. The poor-rich threshold
hxi = x0 = 1 is represented as a continuous line in Fig. 4 and seems to correspond to a λ ≈ 0.75 for this particular
example.

The diﬀerences in the relaxation process are to be related to the diﬀerent relative wealth exchange rates, which by
direct inspection of Eqs. (9) and (10) appear to be proportional to 1 − λ. Thus, in general, higher saving propensities
are expected to be associated to slower relaxation processes. A more detailed analysis can be carried out as shown
in Fig. 5: mean wealths corresponding to agents with diﬀerent λ [Fig. 5 left] appear to relax approximately on the
same time scale and toward the same asymptotic value after the rescaling of time and wealth by the factor (1 − λ)
[Fig. 5 right]. In fact, the factor (1 − λ) is proportional to the wealth exchange rates and, at the same time, through
the condition of stationarity, determines the equilibrium average wealth values hxiλ = k/(1 − λ) [18]. Also in this
case agents start from the same initial condition xi(t = 0) = x0 = 1. However, the system is made up of N = 104
agents uniformly partitioned into 200 subsets with saving propensities λ = 0.5000, 0.5025, ..., 0.9975, in order to study
in detail the high saving propensity — and therefore the higher relaxation time — parameter region.

C. Relaxation time distribution

The model with distributed saving propensity is completely speciﬁed by the trading rules (9) and the saving
propensity set {λi} of the N agents. In the case of continuously distributed λ a continuous saving propensity density
φ(λ) can be used in place of the discrete λ-set, normalized so that R

0 dλ φ(λ) = 1.

Here we suggest a method to obtain the wealth as well as the relaxation distribution directly from the saving
propensity density φ(λ). Simply by probability conservation, one has that ˜f (¯x)d¯x = φ(λ)dλ, where ¯x is a short
notation for hxiλ and ˜f (¯x) is the density of the average wealth values. Thus one obtains

˜f (¯x) = φ(λ)

= φ(1 − k/¯x)

dλ(¯x)
d¯x

C
¯x2 .

This shows that a uniform saving propensity distribution leads to a power law ˜f (¯x) ∼ 1/¯x2 in the (average) wealth
distribution. In general a λ-density going to zero for λ → 1 as φ(λ) ∝ (1 − λ)α−1 (with α ≥ 1) leads to the Pareto
law ˜f (¯x) ∼ 1/¯x1+α with Pareto exponent α ≥ 1 as found in real distributions.

In a very similar way it is possible to obtain straightforwardly the associated distribution of relaxation times ψ(τ )
for the global relaxation process through the relation between the relaxation time τλ and the agent saving propensity,
τλ ∝ 1/(1 − λ):

ψ(τ ) = φ(λ)

∝ φ(1 − 1/τ )/τ 2 .

dλ(τ )
dτ

Comparison with Eq. (11) shows that ψ(τ ) and ˜f (¯x) are characterized by power law tails with the same Pareto
exponent.

Furthermore, as discussed in Ref. [18], in the parameter region λ → 1, from which the main contribution to the
Pareto power law tail come, the widths of the generic equilibrium partial distributions fλ(x) increase slower than the
diﬀerence between the mean values hxiλ′ − hxiλ corresponding to two agents with consecutive values of the saving
propensity λ′ and λ. In other words at equilibrium and in the tail of the distribution it is possible to approximate
without ambiguities the value of wealth x(t) of an agent with saving propensity λ, which is actually a stochastic
process, with the average value, hxiλ ≈ x, and, as a consequence, ˜f (x) ≈ f (x).

Finally we notice that an ensemble with a power law distribution of relaxation times undergoes a slow relaxation
process if the exponent of the relaxation time distribution is smaller than two, so that a Pareto exponent larger than
two, as automatically generated by the model, seems to ensure a normal relaxation.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

The relaxation process of statistical many-agent models of closed economy, in which trading is described as a ﬂux
of wealth between diﬀerent agents, has been found to be slower for richer agents, i.e. for larger values of the saving
propensity λ: namely the relaxation time is τλ ∝ 1/(1 − λ). Furthermore, a smooth distribution of saving propensity
leads both to a wealth distribution and to a relaxation time distribution with power law tails characterized by the
same Pareto exponent α ≥ 1, which ensures a fast relaxation toward equilibrium.

We also remark that if the system is evolved with a dynamics in which all agents perform one trade during a
single time step, then the time evolution and the relaxation process are independent of the system size and provides
information on arbitrarily large systems.

Abstract. - We present a study of the application of a variant of a recently introduced heuristic
algorithm for the optimization of transport routes on complex networks to the problem of ﬁnding
the optimal routes of communication between nodes on wireless networks. Our algorithm iter-
atively balances network traﬃc by minimizing the maximum node betweenness on the network.
The variant we consider speciﬁcally accounts for the broadcast restrictions imposed by wireless
communication by using a diﬀerent betweenness measure. We compare the performance of our
algorithm to two other known algorithms and ﬁnd that our algorithm achieves the highest trans-
port capacity both for minimum node degree geometric networks, which are directed geometric
networks that model wireless communication networks, and for conﬁguration model networks that
are uncorrelated scale-free networks.

The study of transport on complex networks has attracted
a great deal of interest in recent years [1–22]. One of the
most important problems is to determine the routes be-
tween pairs of nodes that optimize the eﬃciency of the
transport. Oftentimes, the routes that are used on net-
works are the so-called shortest-path routes, which are the
routes with the minimum number of hops between any two
nodes. As the volume of the transport increases, this ap-
proach leads to congestion or jamming of highly connected
nodes on the network called hubs. Interest has developed
in ﬁnding the routes that allow a given network to bear the
highest possible amount of traﬃc without jamming [2–7].
This is done in general by deﬁning the length of a path as a
sum of weights assigned to the links that form it, and then
reweighting various links to spread the traﬃc throughout
the network and avoid jamming at hubs. The problem of
ﬁnding the exact optimal routing has been shown [3, 23]
to be N P -hard. Recently, however, we introduced a new
heuristic routing optimization algorithm and showed [5,6]
that it ﬁnds near-optimal routing on both random (Erd˝os-
R´enyi) [24] and scale-free [25] networks. Remarkably, this
algorithm runs in only polynomial time O(N 3 log N ). We
also found that optimal routing preserves the small world
character of networks [26].

In this paper we use a variant of our algorithm to ﬁnd
optimal routes for transport on wireless communication

networks, which has been the subject of a number of re-
cent papers [7–13]. Wireless networks are described by
variants of random geometric networks. These networks
lack the small world eﬀect [26] that characterizes all of
other types of networks we have previously applied our
algorithm to. Transport on wireless networks occurs only
along the subset of links that are bidirectional. However,
in order to avoid broadcasting interference, every time a
node broadcasts an information packet the nodes at the
ends of all of its outgoing links, whether they are bidirec-
tional or not, are prevented from broadcasting or receiving
packets. The variant of our algorithm we consider here ac-
counts for these broadcasting restrictions.

In order to study the eﬀectiveness of our optimization
of routing on wireless networks and to understand how
the optimization process works, we will compare results
given by our optimal routing algorithm (OR) with those
obtained using the shortest path routing algorithm (SP)
and with the algorithm introduced in Ref. [7] (KR). The
three algorithms will be applied to two diﬀerent types of
networks: minimum node degree geometric networks that,
as stated above, are good models for wireless communica-
tion networks [13], and conﬁguration model networks that
are uncorrelated scale-free networks [27]. Note that re-
cent studies have shown that scale-free distributions of the
node degrees are achievable [28–30] on geometric networks

by a community-aware manipulation of the broadcasting
powers of the nodes.

Minimum node degree geometric networks are con-
structed by uniformly distributing N nodes randomly on a
unit square and then adjusting their broadcasting powers
until each node achieves a minimum degree kmin counting
only bidirectional links. They diﬀer from random geo-
metric networks [31] by their highly peaked degree dis-
tribution, with an average degree
very close to kmin.
Random geometric networks, by contrast, are obtained by
connecting all pairs of nodes situated at a geometric dis-
tance shorter than a given threshold and are characterized
by a binomial degree distribution. To facilitate compar-
ison with Ref. [7], the minimum degree kmin is taken to
be 8. Networks generated using the conﬁguration model
are characterized by a much broader power-law distribu-
k−γ, and by the absence
tion of the node degrees, p(k)
of any correlation between the degrees of adjacent nodes.
The node degrees are allowed to vary between a lower cut-
oﬀ m and the square root of the number of nodes N . In
our simulations we used m = 2 and γ = 2.5. For both
models we considered networks with N between 30 and
1600. Both unconstrained routing as well as routing with
wireless broadcasting constraints are considered for each
case.

∝

Our results show that the new variant of our algorithm
achieves a signiﬁcant improvement over the one presented
in Ref. [7] for minimum node degree geometric networks.
However, this improvement is not as large as we achieved
for scale-free networks. We will argue that this reduction
in optimization eﬃciency is due to constraints on rerout-
ing imposed by the non-small world nature of geometric
networks.

Routing on the network is assumed to be done accord-
ing to a static protocol which prescribes the next hop(s)
for a packet currently at node i and whose destination is
node t. Each node is assumed to have a packet queue
which works on a “ﬁrst-in/ﬁrst-out” basis. When a new
packet is added to the network at some node or arrives at
a new node along its path, it is appended at the end of
the queue. Upon reaching their destination, packets are
removed from the network. For simplicity, we assume that
all nodes have the same processing capacity of 1 packet per
time step (assuming they are not inhibited by broadcast-
ing neighbors) and that new packets are inserted at every
node at the same average rate of r packets per time step.
This average insertion rate characterizes the load of the
network. The destinations of the packets inserted at node
i are chosen at random from among the other N
1 nodes
on the network. The algorithm can, however, be general-
ized for nodes with diﬀerent processing capacities and for
arbitrary traﬃc demands.

Given a loop-free routing table, the betweenness b(s,t)
of
node i with respect to a source node s and a destination
node t is deﬁned [32] as the sum of the probabilities of
all paths between s and t that pass through i. The total

betweenness Bi is found by summing up the contributions
from all pairs of source and destination nodes. The prac-
tical way [32] to compute b(s,t)
for all i and s is as follows:
all nodes are assigned weight 1 and then the weight of ev-
ery node along each path towards t is split evenly among
its predecessors in the routing table on the way from t to
s and added to the weights of the predecessors.

The aforementioned broadcasting restrictions are equiv-
alent to saying that every node is processing not only the
information packets passing through itself, but also those
passing through its incoming neighbors. This situation
can be accounted for by using the cumulative between-

Thus, to achieve optimal routing on a wireless network,
the highest cumulative betweenness Bcum
max should be min-
imized [9].

The application of our algorithm to ordinary networks
has been described in Ref. [5]. For wireless networks, the
algorithm proceeds as follows:

1. Assign uniform weight to every bidirectional link (SP
routing) and compute the shortest paths between all pairs
of nodes and the betweenness of every node.

2. Find the node i0 which has the highest cumulative
betweenness Bcum
max and then the node with the highest
i0 .

Increase the weight of every bidirectional link that con-
nects the latter node to other nodes by adding half the
initial weight to it.

3. Recompute the shortest paths and the betweennesses.

Go back to step 2.
To achieve the O(N 3 log N ) running time, a binary heap
must be used in the Dijkstra algorithm [33] for the com-
putation of the shortest paths to reduce the time required
to sort the nodes by distance.

The algorithm described in Ref. [7] treats bidirectional
links as two separate directed links and uses the cumula-
tive betweenness of the node of origin as link weight. All
cumulative betweennesses are initially set equal to 1 for
the purpose of routing computation and then two rounds
of iterations are performed. In the course of each round
all shortest path routes are computed in the order of their

node of origin, based on the latest values of the cumula-
tive betweennesses. These values are updated after each
computation of the shortest paths originating from a given
node. This algorithm runs in time O(N 2).

Throughout the paper, the network average of the be-

over an ensemble of network realizations is indicated by
angular brackets. Fig. 1 shows the ensemble averages of

Results are presented for shortest path routing (SP), for
the optimal routing given by our algorithm (OR), and
for the routing algorithm described in Ref. [7] (KR). The
results for the average cumulative betweennesses (cid:10)Bcum
avg (cid:11)
and
for minimum node degree geometric networks
are shown in ﬁg. 2. For small networks of up to approxi-
mately 100 nodes the scaling of (cid:10)Bcum
with
network size is somewhat anomalous, but for larger net-
works both quantities scale with network size according
to power laws. The exponents of the power laws were
computed by ﬁtting data corresponding to N between 200
and 1600. The values of the exponents are given in ta-
ble , with the quoted errors being 2σ estimates.
It is
apparent from ﬁgs. 1 and 2 and from table that our al-
gorithm achieves the lowest maximum betweenness for a
given network size. Both optimization algorithms obtain a
signiﬁcant improvement over shortest path routing. This
is unlike the case of random or scale-free networks, where
our algorithm brings a signiﬁcant improvement in trans-
port capacity when compared to any other optimization
algorithm.

munication ranges much smaller than the physical size of
the network any shortest paths follow approximately the
geometric shortest path and pass on average through a
number of nodes proportional to the square root of the
geometric distance between source and destination. On
virtually all other types of networks of practical interest
the average number of hops along the path increases with
network size slower than logarithmically. This absence of
shortcuts causes network traﬃc to be quite evenly spread
even in the case of SP routing and reduces the likelihood
of ﬁnding alternative paths that lower the maximum be-
tweenness. Computation of
shows that, even in the

case of the minimum node degree model where the broad-
casting powers of the nodes are not equal, the average
number of hops along the path scales with network size
approximately as √N . The lack of a small world eﬀect
could be remedied by adding a few long range connections
between randomly chosen pairs of nodes [34, 35]. This
can be done in practice by scattering a few special nodes
equipped with long range unidirectional antennas. The
second reason for the less signiﬁcant diﬀerence between
the two algorithms is the highly peaked distribution of
the node degrees which is a characteristic of the minimum
node degree model and also contributes to the uniformity
of traﬃc spreading.

geometric network model and is comparable for both wire-
less and ordinary networks. This may become particularly
useful if the geometric network topology of wireless net-
works is somehow altered (for example by introducing a
community-aware distribution of the broadcasting powers)
to resemble the topology of a small world network.

In summary, we have introduced a new algorithm for
transport optimization on wireless networks and compared
its performance with another recently introduced routing
optimization algorithm. The eﬀectiveness of transport op-
timization on wireless networks was compared to results
obtained for ordinary networks with no broadcasting con-
straints. We found that our algorithm performs better in
all cases studied, more signiﬁcantly so in the case of scale-
free networks. The less signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the case
of minimum node degree geometric networks is due to the
geometric network topology (which results in a lack of a
small-world eﬀect) and to the narrowly peaked distribu-
tion of node degrees.

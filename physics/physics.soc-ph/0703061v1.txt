Abstrat

Correlation matries inferred from stok return time series ontain information on

the behaviour of the market, espeially on lusters of highly orrelating stoks. Here

we study a subset of New York Stok Exhange (NYSE) traded stoks and ompare

three di(cid:27)erent methods of analysis: i) spetral analysis, i.e. investigation of the

eigenvalue-eigenvetor pairs of the orrelation matrix, ii) asset trees, obtained by

onstruting the maximal spanning tree of the orrelation matrix, and iii) asset

graphs, whih are networks in whih the strongest orrelations are depited as edges.

We illustrate and disuss the loalisation of the most signi(cid:28)ant modes of (cid:29)utuation,

i.e. eigenvetors orresponding to the largest eigenvalues, on the asset trees and

graphs.

Introdution

The exat nature of interations between stok market partiipants is not

known but their manifestations in the performane of stoks are visible. There-

fore it is natural to study orrelation matries of stok returns to learn about

the internal struture of the market. This an be done by studying the spetral

properties of orrelation matries or by onstruting and studying weighted

omplex networks based on these matries (see e.g. [1, 2, 3, 4℄ and referenes

therein). Here, we ompare these two approahes.

The paper is organised as follows: in Setion 2 we give a short introdution

to (cid:28)nanial orrelation matries and their spetral properties. A omparison

of the spetral properties and results obtained using asset trees and graphs is

presented in Setion 3. Summary and onlusions are given in Setion 4.

2 Correlation matrix and its spetral properties

Our dataset onsists of the split-adjusted daily losing pries of N = 116

stoks, traded at the New York Stok Exhange (NYSE) for the time period

from 13-Jan-1997 to 29-De-2000. This amounts to 1000 prie quotes per stok.

The equal time orrelation matrix of logarithmi returns is onstruted by

Cij =

hGiGji − hGiihGji
σiσj

,

(1)

i i − hGii2

where σi = qhG2
, Gi(t) = ln Pi(t) − ln Pi(t − 1), Pi(t) is the prie of
stok i at time t and the angular brakets denote time average. From Eq. 1 we
see that the orrelation matrix C is the ovariane matrix of the time series
resaled to have unit variane. These time series an be seen as T realisations
of a random vetor Z in
are real numbers and we have N time series of length T . By diagonalising
C we an (cid:28)nd an orthogonal system of oordinates where the omponents of
Z do not orrelate. These omponents are usually alled the prinipal om-

RN

, assuming that the elements of the time series

ponents. The elements of the diagonal matrix, the eigenvalues, impliate the

varianes of the orresponding prinipal omponents. In the following we de-

note the eigenvetors of C by x1, . . . , xN and the orresponding eigenvalues by
λ1, . . . , λN , where λ1 > . . . > λN .

The eigenvetors an be thought to represent modes of (cid:29)utuation. The time

series studied here are suh that the resaling makes them omparable with

eah other and this is learly inherited to the prinipal omponents. Thus the

eigenvalues re(cid:29)et the signi(cid:28)ane of the orresponding modes of (cid:29)utuation.

The orrelation matrix C of N assets has N(N − 1)/2 distint entries. Assum-
ing that one determines an empirial orrelation matrix from N time series
of length T and T is not very large ompared to N , the entries of the or-

relation matrix are very noisy and the matrix is to a large extent random.

Laloux et al. [5℄ and Plerou et al. [6℄ have studied the spetral properties of

(cid:28)nanial orrelation matries and onluded that only few eigenpairs arry

real information. Their work suggests that the eigenvalues an be lassi(cid:28)ed as

mode of (cid:29)utuation, the market eigenvetor x1 . The olor of a node denotes the
ontribution of the orresponding omponent of x1 to the length of the eigenvetor.

The largest omponent is olored blak. For other nodes, linear sale is used suh

that white olor indiates zero ontribution.

follows:

(1) The very smallest eigenvalues do not belong to the random part of the

spetrum. The orresponding eigenvetors are highly loalized, i.e., only

a few assets ontribute to them.

(2) The next smallest eigenvalues (about 95 % of all eigenvalues) form the

(cid:16)bulk(cid:17) of the spetrum. They or at least most of them orrespond to noise

and are well desribed by random matrix theory.

(3) The largest eigenvalue is well separated from the bulk and orresponds

to the whole market as the orresponding eigenvetor has roughly equal

omponents.

(4) The next largest eigenvetors arry information about the real orrela-

tions and an be used in identifying lusters of strongly interating assets.

3 Asset trees, asset graphs and eigenvetor loalisation

In addition to spetral analysis, orrelation matries of stok return time se-

ries have reently been analyzed with network-related methods. The aim has

been to unover struture in the orrelation matrix in the form of lusters

of highly orrelating stoks. In this setion we disuss how the eigenvetors

orresponding to the largest eigenvalues are loalized with respet to lusters

of stoks inferred using the asset tree [1, 2℄ and asset graph [7℄ approahes.

The maximal spanning tree of the stoks, later referred to as the asset tree, is

and x5 (panels 1-4, respetively). The orientation of the triangle at a node denotes

the sign of the orresponding eigenvetor omponent, and the olor is determined

as in Fig. 1. Clusters orresponding to these eigenvetors, identi(cid:28)ed by the lique

perolation method, are denoted by the shaded bakground.

a simply onneted graph onsisting of all N stoks and N − 1 edges suh that

the sum of the orrelation oe(cid:30)ients between the endpoints of eah edge

is maximized. Fig. 1 displays the asset tree for our data set, together with

the market eigenvetor x1 , i.e., the most signi(cid:28)ant mode of (cid:29)utuation. The

olor of a node denotes the ontribution of the orresponding eigenvetor om-

ponent to the length of the eigenvetor (i.e., the square of the omponent).

The linear olor map is hosen suh that white olor indiates zero ontribu-

tion and the largest omponent is denoted by blak, shades of grey depiting

smaller omponent values. We see that the most entral nodes of the asset

graph ontribute most to the market eigenvetor. This is rather natural, as

the entral nodes in the asset graph are known to be very large multisetor

ompanies or investment banks, whih obviously (cid:29)utuate as their diversi(cid:28)ed

investments [2℄.

As disussed earlier by Mantegna [1℄ and Onnela et al. [2℄, the asset tree on-

tains a lot information about the lustering of stoks. Therefore it is very

interesting to ompare the loalization of the next most signi(cid:28)ant modes and

the topology of the asset tree. From Fig. 2, where the nodes are plotted with

the same oordinates as in Fig. 1 and the loalisation of x2 , x3 , x4 and x5

is illustrated (panels 1-4, respetively), we see that these modes are mainly

loalised to branhes of the asset tree. In these eigenvetors, unlike in the mar-

ket eigenvetor x1 , omponents of both signs exist. The sign of a omponent is

denoted by the orientation (up or down) of the triangle at the orresponding

approximately orrespond to the Eletri Utilities industry of the Utilities se-

tor, the Energy setor, the Basi Materials setor and the Healthare setor.

Onnela et al. [7℄ were the (cid:28)rst to study the lustering of stoks using asset

graphs onstruted from orrelation matries of returns. An asset graph is

onstruted by ranking the non-diagonal elements of the orrelation matrix

C in dereasing order and then adding a set fration of links between stoks

starting from the strongest orrelation oe(cid:30)ient. The emergent network an

be haraterised by a parameter p, the ratio of the number of added links to
the number of all possible links, N(N − 1)/2. Evidently, the higher the value
of p, the denser the resulting network; in our view the question of whether
some spei(cid:28) value of p yields the most informative struture is still open (see
Ref. [7℄ for results obtained by sweeping the p value). For the following analysis
we have simply hosen p = 0.025 as with this value the strongest lusters are

learly visible. In order to identify the visually apparent luster struture,

we have utilized the lique perolation method introdued by Palla et al. [9℄,

using liques of size three. The four lusters deteted with this method, best

orresponding to eigenvetors x2, . . . , x5 are illustrated in Fig. 2. The lusters

are seen to mostly orrespond to the above-mentioned industry setors.

From Fig. 2 we see that x2 and x3 are rather strongly loalised to the respetive
lusters; however, x4 and espeially x5 no longer math the lusters well. The
loalisation of the market eigenvetor x1 and the following four eigenvetors

is quanti(cid:28)ed in Table I, whih displays the inner produts of these eigenve-

tors and vetors depiting the lique perolation lusters. We have de(cid:28)ned a

normalized vetor to depit eah luster suh that ec = [e1
ei
c is onstant for all omponents belonging to luster c and zero for other
omponents. It is seen that x1 is rather evenly distributed in the lusters,
whereas x2 and x3 are mostly loalised on the Eletri Utilities and Energy
lusters, respetively. Similarly x4 and x5 are mostly loalised on the Basi

c, . . . , eN

c ]T

, where

Materials and Healthare lusters. However, the di(cid:27)erene to other lusters

appears to beome smaller with inreasing eigenvetor index. This is orrob-

orated by analysis of further eigenvetors (not shown); with some exeptions

the eigenvetors with higher indies appear less well loalized with respet to

lusters of the asset graph or branhes in the asset tree.

4 Summary and onlusions

We have studied and ompared how strongly orrelated lusters of stoks are

revealed as branhes in the asset tree, as lusters in asset graphs, and as non-

random eigenpairs of the orrelation matrix. The eigenvetor orresponding

to the largest eigenvalue has roughly equal omponents, but the omponents

orresponding to the most entral nodes of the asset tree are on average some-

what larger than others. The eigenvetors orresponding to the next largest

eigenvalues are to some extent loalised on branhes of the asset tree. When

omparing the loalization of these eigenvetors to lique perolation lusters,

it is seen that the (cid:28)rst few eigenvetors math the lusters rather well. How-

ever, their borders are (cid:16)fuzzy(cid:17) and do not de(cid:28)ne lear luster boundaries. With

inreasing eigenvetor index, the eigenvetors appear to loalize inreasingly

less regularly with respet to the asset graph (or asset tree) topology. Hene

it appears that identifying the strongly interating lusters of stoks solely

based on spetral properties of the orrelation matrix is rather di(cid:30)ult; the

asset graph method seems to provide more oherent results.

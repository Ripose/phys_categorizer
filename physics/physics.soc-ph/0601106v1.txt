Abstract

In this paper we present an interacting-agent model of ﬁnancial markets. We de-
scribe a ﬁnancial market through an Ising model to formulate the tendency of agents
getting inﬂuenced by the other agents’ investment attitude [8]. We formulate the
agents’ decision making on investment as the minimum energy principle for Tsallis
entropy [11] , and demonstrate that the equilibrium probability distribution function
of the investment attitude of interacting-agents is the q-exponential distribution. We
also show that the power-law distribution of volatility of price ﬂuctuations, which is
often demonstrated in the empirical studies [17], can be explained naturally by our
model that have their origin in the collective crowd behavior of many interacting-
agents.

1 Introduction

In the past decades, the eﬃcient market hypothesis is the dominating paradigm
in ﬁnance and ﬁnancial engineering [1]. The eﬃcient market hypothesis argues
that the current price already contains all information and past prices can not
help in predicting future prices. In an eﬃcient market, stock prices are com-
pletely determined by its fundamentals, given by the present discounted value
of the stream of future dividends. The prices would solely be driven by eco-
nomic news (exogenous random shocks) about changes in fundamentals, so
that prices follow a random walk [1]. However, the eﬃcient market hypoth-
esis lost ground rapidly following the accumulation of evidence against the

eﬃcient market hypothesis [2]. For instance, Shiller [3] ﬁnds that stock mar-
ket volatility is far greater than could be justiﬁed by changes in dividends. A
new approach proposed as alternatives to the eﬃcient market theory is the
interacting-agent approach that models the trading process with its interaction
of a large ensemble of heterogeneous traders. There is the emerging literature
on interacting-agent dynamics initiated by W. Brock [4], A. Kirman [5], and
M. Aoki [6]. A number of interacting-agent models proposed recently showed
that they can generate some ubiquitous characteristics (the clustered volatil-
ity and the scaling behaviors) found for empirical ﬁnancial data as a result of
interactions between agents. The emergence of realistic scaling laws from the
agents’ interaction would lend a convinced evidence in favor of the Interacting
Agent Hypothesis. Although the interacting agent models are advocated as an
alternative approach to the eﬃcient market hypothesis that is equivalent to the
rational expectation hypothesis in economics [7], little attention has been given
to the point how probabilistic rules, that an agent switches his opinion, is con-
nected with his expectation formation. Our previous work [8] proposed a new
expectation formation hypothesis, that is, the relative expectation formation
hypothesis corresponding to the interacting-agent hypothesis. The relative ex-
pectations formation of interacting-agents has been formularized by using the
minimum average energy principle for Bolztmann-Gibbs entropy [9, 10]. The
aim of this paper is to generalize the formulation of the relative expectation
formation from the viewpoint of the nonextensive statistical mechanics [11-13].
The nonextensive statistical mechanics has been introduced as a generaliza-
tion of the traditional Boltzmann-Gibbs statistical mechanics by C. Tsallis
[11] 1 . We shall present an interacting-agent model that follows the line of an
Ising-like model of ﬁnancial markets proposed by our previous work [8], and
formulate the agents’ decision-making on investment as the minimum energy
principle for Tsallis entropy [11], and demonstrate that a equilibrium proba-
bility distribution on the agent’s investment attitude, which is obtained as the
so-called q-exponential distribution, is able to be derived from the relative ex-
pectations formation. We also show that the interacting-agent model gives an
explanation for an universal statistical characteristics of ﬁnancial data, that is,
the power-law tails of the distribution of volatility, measured by the absolute
value of relative price changes [17].

2 An interacting-agent model

2.1 The relative expectation formation

We think of the ﬁnancial market that large numbers of agents (or traders)
participate in trading. Traders are indexed by j = 1, 2, ........, N. We assume
that each of them can share one of two investment attitudes, buyer or seller,
and buy or sell a ﬁxed amount of the asset (q) in a period. xi denotes the
investment attitude of trader i at a period. The investment attitude xi is
deﬁned as follows: if trader i is the buyer of the asset at a period, then xi = +1.
If trader i, in contrast, is the seller of the asset at a period, then xi = −1.
A trader, who expects a certain exchange proﬁt through trading, will predict
every other traders’ behavior in order to forecast the future movement of the
price, and will choose either the same behavior or the contrarious behavior
as the other traders’ behavior. The decision-making of traders will be also
inﬂuenced by changes of the news related with the asset. When a good (bad)
news increases (decreases) a trader may think that now is the time for him
to buy (sell) the asset. Formally let us assume that the investment attitude
of trader i is determined by minimization of the following evaluation function
ei(x),

ei(x) = −J

xjxi − bsxi.

j=1

where J denotes the strength of the other traders’ inﬂuence on a trader, and
b denotes the strength of the reaction of a trader upon the change of the news
s which may be interpreted as an external ﬁeld, and x denotes the vector of
investment attitude of all the traders x = (x1, x2, ......xN ). A trader who has
the positive value of J is called as the trend follower and a trader who has the
negative value of J is called as the contrarian. The optimization problem that
should be solved for every trader to achieve minimization of their evaluation
functions ei(x) is formalized by

min E(x) = −J

2.2 A minimum average energy principle for nonextensive entropy

In the previous subsection we assume implicitly that a trader can perceive the
investment attitude of the other traders. However, in fact, a trader could not
know the other traders’ decision. This is the core of diﬃculty of forecasting the
movement of ﬁnancial markets. Under the circumstance that a large number
of traders participates into trading, a probabilistic setting may be one of best
means to analyze the collective behavior of the many interacting traders. Now
let us introduce a random variable xk = (xk
N ), k = 1, 2, ....., W .
The state of the traders’ investment attitude xk occur with probability Pk =
W
Prob(xk) with the requirement 0 < Pk < 1 and
k=1 Pk = 1. We formulate the
amount of uncertainty before the occurrence of the state xk with probability
Pk using the so-called Tsallis entropy [11].

is a generalization of the Bolztmann-Gibbs entropy. We ask how changes in
the probability Pk of the random variable aﬀects the agents’ choice. Then the
objective of the agent is to minimize the expected evaluation function, hE(x)i
(corresponding to average energy) for Tsallis entropy (3).

E(xk), and Zq is the partition function. We call the optimizing behavior of
the traders with interaction among the other traders a relative expectation
formation.

2.3 The price adjustment processes

Generally, in ﬁnancial market the price changes are subject to the law of
demand and supply, that the price rises when there is excess demand, and the
price falls when there is excess supply. Therefore, when traders are supposed
to either buy or sell a ﬁxed amount of stock, say, one unit in a period, the
price will rise if the number of the buyer exceeds the number of the seller
N
i=1 xi > 0) because there may be excess demand, and the price will fall if
(
P
N
i=1 xi < 0) because
the number of seller exceeds the number of the seller (
there may be excess supply. It is natural to consider that the price ﬂuctuations

measured by relative price change is proportional to the demand-supply gap,
and so volatility, measured by the absolute value of relative price changes, is
proportional to the absolute value of the demand-supply gap. Let us suppose
that absolute value of the demand-supply gap is proportional to the value of

2.4 Volatility distribution

P (V ) ∝ expq(−αV ).

P (V ) ∝ V 1/(1−q)

We assume that the traders are the contrarian, that is, J < 0. The volatility
distribution is described by the q-exponential distribution,

where α is positive constant and V denotes the volatility. As is well known, for
q > 1 the q-exponential distribution (12) for large volatility is approximated
by a power-law distribution

(12)

(13)

Empirical studies on volatility in ﬁnancial markets often ﬁnd the power-law
distributions of volatility. For instance Liu, et. al [17] analyze the SP 500 stock
index and the stock prices of the individual companies comprising the SP 500
for the 13-year period Jan. 1984 to Dec. 1996, and ﬁnd that the distribution of
the volatility is consistent with a power-law asymptotic behavior, characterized
by an exponent 4. Therefore, the parameter q of the volatility distribution (13)
is estimated as q = 1.25 for the U.S. stock market.

3 Concluding remarks

This paper presents an interacting-agent model of speculative activity explain-
ing the power-laws of the volatility distribution in terms of the nonextensive
statistical mechanics. We show theoretically that the power-laws on price ﬂuc-
tuations is easy to understand as a result of the relative expectations formation
of many interacting agents that is formalized as the minimum average energy
principle for nonextensive entropy.

Abstract

Using a family of modiﬁed Weibull distributions, encompassing both sub-exponentials and super-expo-
nentials, to parameterize the marginal distributions of asset returns and their multivariate generalizations
with Gaussian copulas, we offer exact formulas for the tails of the distribution P (S) of returns S of a
portfolio of arbitrary composition of these assets. We ﬁnd that the tail of P (S) is also asymptotically
a modiﬁed Weibull distribution with a characteristic scale χ function of the asset weights with differ-
ent functional forms depending on the super- or sub-exponential behavior of the marginals and on the
strength of the dependence between the assets. We then treat in details the problem of risk minimization
using the Value-at-Risk and Expected-Shortfall which are shown to be (asymptotically) equivalent in this
framework.

Introduction

In recent years, the Value-at-Risk has become one of the most popular risk assessment tool (Dufﬁe and
Pan 1997, Jorion 1997). The infatuation for this particular risk measure probably comes from a variety of
factors, the most prominent ones being its conceptual simplicity and relevance in addressing the ubiquitous
large risks often inadequately accounted for by the standard volatility, and from its prominent role in the
recommendations of the international banking authorities (Basle Commitee on Banking Supervision 1996,
2001). Moreover, down-side risk measures such as the Value-at-risk seem more in accordance with observed
behavior of economic agents. For instance, according to prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky 1979), the
perception of downward market movements is not the same as upward movements. This may be reﬂected
in the so-called leverage effect, ﬁrst discussed by (Black 1976), who observed that the volatility of a stock
tends to increase when its price drops (see (Fouque et al. 2000, Campbell, Lo and McKinley 1997, Bekaert
and Wu 2000, Bouchaud et al. 2001) for reviews and recent works). Thus, it should be more natural to
consider down-side risk measures like the VaR than the variance traditionally used in portfolio management
(Markowitz 1959) which does not differentiate between positive and negative change in future wealth.

1

However, the choice of the Value-at-Risk has recently been criticized (Szerg¨o 1999, Danielsson et al. 2001)
due to its lack of coherence in the sense of Artzner et al. (1999), among other reasons. This deﬁciency
leads to several theoretical and practical problems. Indeed, other than the class of elliptical distributions,
the VaR is not sub-additive (Embrechts et al. 2002a), and may lead to inefﬁcient risk diversiﬁcation policies
and to severe problems in the practical implementation of portfolio optimization algorithms (see (Chabaane
et al. 2002) for a discussion). Alternative have been proposed in terms of Conditional-VaR or Expected-
Shortfall (Artzner et al. 1999, Acerbi and Tasche 2002, for instance), which enjoy the property of sub-
additivity. This ensures that they yield coherent portfolio allocations which can be obtained by the simple
linear optimization algorithm proposed by Rockafellar and Uryasev (2000).

From a practical standpoint, the estimation of the VaR of a portfolio is a strenuous task, requiring large com-
putational time leading sometimes to disappointing results lacking accuracy and stability. As a consequence,
many approximation methods have been proposed (Tasche and Tilibetti 2001, Embrechts et al. 2002b, for
instance). Empirical models constitute another widely used approach, since they provide a good trade-off
between speed and accuracy.

From a general point of view, the parametric determination of the risks and returns associated with a given
portfolio constituted of N assets is completely embedded in the knowledge of their multivariate distribu-
tion of returns. Indeed, the dependence between random variables is completely described by their joint
distribution. This remark entails the two major problems of portfolio theory: 1) the determination of the
multivariate distribution function of asset returns; 2) the derivation from it of a useful measure of portfolio
risks, in the goal of analyzing and optimizing portfolios. These objective can be easily reached if one can
derive an analytical expression of the portfolio returns distribution from the multivariate distribution of asset
returns.

In the standard Gaussian framework, the multivariate distribution takes the form of an exponential of minus
a quadratic form X ′Ω−1X, where X is the uni-column of asset returns and Ω is their covariance matrix.
The beauty and simplicity of the Gaussian case is that the essentially impossible task of determining a
large multidimensional function is collapsed onto the very much simpler one of calculating the N (N +
1)/2 elements of the symmetric covariance matrix. And, by the statibility of the Gaussian distribution,
the risk is then uniquely and completely embodied by the variance of the portfolio return, which is easily
determined from the covariance matrix. This is the basis of Markowitz (1959)’s portfolio theory and of the
CAPM (Sharpe 1964, Lintner 1965, Mossin 1966). The same phenomenon occurs in the stable Paretian
portfolio analysis derived by (Fama 1965) and generalized to separate positive and negative power law tails
(Bouchaud et al. 1998). The stability of the distribution of returns is essentiel to bypass the difﬁcult problem
of determining the decision rules (utility function) of the economic agents since all the risk measures are
equivalent to a single parameter (the variance in the case of a Gaussian universe).

However, it is well-known that the empirical distributions of returns are neither Gaussian nor L´evy Stable
(Lux 1996, Gopikrishnan et al. 1998, Gouri´eroux and Jasiak 1998) and the dependences between assets are
only imperfectly accounted for by the covariance matrix (Litterman and Winkelmann 1998). It is thus desir-
able to ﬁnd alternative parameterizations of multivariate distributions of returns which provide reasonably
good approximations of the asset returns distribution and which enjoy asymptotic stability properties in the
tails so as to be relevant for the VaR.

To this aim, section 1 presents a speciﬁc parameterization of the marginal distributions in terms of so-called
modiﬁed Weibull distributions introduced by Sornette et al. (2000b), which are essentially exponential of
minus a power law. This family of distributions contains both sub-exponential and super-exponentials,
including the Gaussian law as a special case. It is shown that this parameterization is relevant for modeling
the distribution of asset returns in both an unconditional and a conditional framework. The dependence
structure between the asset is described by a Gaussian copula which allows us to describe several degrees of

2

dependence: from independence to comonotonicity. The relevance of the Gaussian copula has been put in
light by several recent studies (Sornette et al. 2000a, Sornette et al. 2000b, Malevergne and Sornette 2001,
Malevergne and Sornette 2002c).

In section 2, we use the multivariate construction based on (i) the modiﬁed Weibull marginal distributions
and (ii) the Gaussian copula to derive the asymptotic analytical form of the tail of the distribution of returns
of a portfolio composed of an arbitrary combination of these assets.
In the case where individual asset
returns have modiﬁed-Weibull distributions, we show that the tail of the distribution of portfolio returns S
is asymptotically of the same form but with a characteristic scale χ function of the asset weights taking
different functional forms depending on the super- or sub-exponential behavior of the marginals and on the
strength of the dependence between the assets. Thus, this particular class of modiﬁed-Weibull distributions
enjoys (asymptotically) the same stability properties as the Gaussian or L´evy distributions. The dependence
properties are shown to be embodied in the N (N + 1)/2 elements of a non-linear covariance matrix and the
individual risk of each assets are quantiﬁed by the sub- or super-exponential behavior of the marginals.

Section 3 then uses this non-Gaussian nonlinear dependence framework to estimate the Value-at-Risk (VaR)
and the Expected-Shortfall. As in the Gaussian framework, the VaR and the Expected-Shortfall are (asymp-
totically) controlled only by the non-linear covariance matrix, leading to their equivalence. More generally,
any risk measure based on the (sufﬁciently far) tail of the distribution of the portfolio returns are equivalent
since they can be expressed as a function of the non-linear covariance matrix and the weights of the assets
only.

Section 4 uses this set of results to offer an approach to portfolio optimization based on the asymptotic
form of the tail of the distribution of portfolio returns. When possible, we give the analytical formulas of
the explicit composition of the optimal portfolio or suggest the use of reliable algorithms when numerical
calculation is needed.

Section 5 concludes.

Before proceeding with the presentation of our results, we set the notations to derive the basic problem
addressed in this paper, namely to study the distribution of the sum of weighted random variables with given
marginal distributions and dependence. Consider a portfolio with ni shares of asset i of price pi(0) at time
t = 0 whose initial wealth is

In the sequel, we shall thus consider the asset returns Xi as the fundamental variables and study their
aggregation properties, namely how the distribution of portfolio return equal to their weighted sum derives
for their multivariable distribution. We shall consider a single time scale τ which can be chosen arbitrarily,
say equal to one day. We shall thus drop the dependence on τ , understanding implicitly that all our results
hold for returns estimated over time step τ .

1 Deﬁnitions and important concepts

1.1 The modiﬁed Weibull distributions

We will consider a class of distributions with fat tails but decaying faster than any power law. Such possi-
ble behavior for assets returns distributions have been suggested to be relevant by several empirical works
(Mantegna and Stanley 1995, Gouri´eroux and Jasiak 1998, Malevergne et al. 2002) and has also been as-
serted to provide a convenient and ﬂexible parameterization of many phenomena found in nature and in
the social sciences (Lah`erre and Sornette 1998).
In all the following, we will use the parameterization
introduced by Sornette et al. (2000b) and deﬁne the modiﬁed-Weibull distributions:

DEFINITION 1 (MODIFIED WEIBULL DISTRIBUTION)
A random variable X will be said to follow a modiﬁed Weibull distribution with exponent c and scale
parameter χ,denoted inthesequel X

These so-called modiﬁed-Weibull distributions can be seen to be general forms of the extreme tails of prod-
uct of random variables (Frisch and Sornette 1997), and using the theorem of change of variable, we can
assert that the density of such distributions is

,

where c and χ are the two key parameters.

These expressions are close to the Weibull distribution, with the addition of a power law prefactor to the
exponential such that the Gaussian law is retrieved for c = 2. Following Sornette et al. (2000b), Sornette
et al. (2000a) and Andersen and Sornette (2001), we call (7) the modiﬁed Weibull distribution. For c < 1,
the pdf is a stretched exponential, which belongs to the class of sub-exponential. The exponent c determines
the shape of the distribution, fatter than an exponential if c < 1. The parameter χ controls the scale or
characteristic width of the distribution. It plays a role analogous to the standard deviation of the Gaussian
law.

The interest of these family of distributions for ﬁnancial purposes have also been recently underlined by
Brummelhuis and Gu´egan (2000) and Brummelhuis et al. (2002). Indeed these authors have shown that

given a series of return
rt}t following a GARCH(1,1) process, the large deviations of the returns rt+k
{
and of the aggregated returns rt +
+ rt+k conditional on the return at time t are distributed according
to a modiﬁed-Weibull distribution, where the exponent c is related to the number of step forward k by the
formula c = 2/k .

A more general parameterization taking into account a possible asymmetry between negative and positive
values (thus leading to possible non-zero mean) is

In what follows, we will assume that the marginal probability distributions of returns follow modiﬁed
Weibull distributions. Figure 1 shows the (negative) “Gaussianized” returns Y deﬁned in (6) of the Standard
and Poor’s 500 index versus the raw returns X over the time interval from January 03, 1995 to December
29, 2000. With such a representation, the modiﬁed-Weibull distributions are qualiﬁed by a power law of
exponent c/2, by deﬁnition 1. The double logarithmic scales of ﬁgure 1 clearly shows a straight line over an
extended range of data, qualifying a power law relationship. An accurate determination of the parameters
(χ, c) can be performed by maximum likelihood estimation (Sornette 2000, pp 160-162). However, note
that, in the tail, the six most extreme points signiﬁcantly deviate from the modiﬁed-Weibull description.
Such an anomalous behavior of the most extreme returns can be probably be associated with the notion
of “outliers” introduced by Johansen and Sornette (1998, 2002) and associated with behavioral and crowd
phenomena during turbulent market phases.

The modiﬁed Weibull distributions deﬁned here are of interest for ﬁnancial purposes and speciﬁcally for
portfolio and risk management, since they offer a ﬂexible parametric representation of asset returns dis-
tribution either in a conditional or an unconditional framework, depending on the standpoint prefered by
manager. The rest of the paper uses this family of distributions.

1.2 Tail equivalence for distribution functions

An interesting feature of the modiﬁed Weibull distributions, as we will see in the next section, is to enjoy the
property of asymptotic stability. Asymptotic stability means that, in the regime of large deviations, a sum
of independent and identically distributed modiﬁed Weibull variables follows the same modiﬁed Weibull
distribution, up to a rescaling.

1.3 The Gaussian copula

We recall only the basic properties about copulas and refer the interested reader to (Nelsen 1998), for in-
stance, for more information. Let us ﬁrst give the deﬁnition of a copula of n random variables.

DEFINITION 3 (COPULA)
Afunction C : [0, 1]n

−→

[0, 1] isa n-copula ifitenjoys thefollowing properties :

positive. (cid:3)

, un) = 0 ifatleast oneofthe ui equals zero,

· · ·

•

The fact that such copulas can be very useful for representing multivariate distributions with arbitrary
marginals is seen from the following result.

THEOREM 1 (SKLAR’S THEOREM)
Given an n-dimensional distribution function F with continuous marginal distributions F1,
existsa unique n-copula C : [0, 1]n

This theorem provides both a parameterization of multivariate distributions and a construction scheme for
copulas. Indeed, given a multivariate distribution F with margins F1,

is automatically a n-copula. Applying this theorem to the multivariate Gaussian distribution, we can derive
the so-called Gaussian copula.

It can be shown that the Gaussian copula naturally arises when one tries to determine the dependence be-
tween random variables using the principle of entropy maximization (Rao 1973, Sornette et al. 2000b, for
instance). Its pertinence and limitations for modeling the dependence between assets returns has been tested
by Malevergne and Sornette (2001), who show that in most cases, this description of the dependence can
be considered satisfying, specially for stocks, provided that one does not consider too extreme realizations
(Malevergne and Sornette 2002a, Malevergne and Sornette 2002b, Mashal and Zeevi 2002).

2 Portfolio wealth distribution for several dependence structures

2.1 Portfolio wealth distribution for independent assets

Let us ﬁrst consider the case of a portfolio made of independent assets. This limiting (and unrealistic) case
is a mathematical idealization which provides a ﬁrst natural benchmark of the class of portolio return dis-
tributions to be expected. Moreover, it is generally the only case for which the calculations are analytically
tractable. For such independepent assets distributed with the modiﬁed Weibull distributions, the following
results prove the asymptotic stability of this set of distributions:

2.2 Portfolio wealth distribution for comonotonic assets

The case of comonotonic assets is of interest as the limiting case of the strongest possible dependence
between random variables. By deﬁnition,

DEFINITION 5 (COMONOTONICITY)
the variables X1, X2,
decreasing functions f1, f2,

· · ·

, fN such that

· · ·

, XN are comonotonic if and only if there exits a random variable U and non-

(X1, X2,

· · ·

, XN )

d
= (f1(U ), f2(U ),

, fN (U )).

· · ·

In terms of copulas, the comonotonicity can be expressed by the following form of the copula

C(u1, u2,

, uN ) = min(u1, u2,

, uN ) .

· · ·

· · ·

This expression is known as the Fr´echet-Hoeffding upper bound for copulas (Nelsen 1998, for instance). It
would be appealing to think that estimating the Value-at-Risk under the comonotonicity assumption could
provide an upper bound for the Value-at-Risk. However, it turns out to be wrong, due –as we shall see in the
sequel– to the lack of coherence (in the sense of Artzner et al. (1999)) of the Value-at-Risk, in the general
case. Notwithstanding, an upper and lower bound can always be derived for the Value-at-Risk (Embrechts
et al. 2002b). But in the present situation, where we are only interested in the class of modiﬁed Weibull
distributions with a Gaussian copula, the VaR derived under the comonoticity assumption will actually
represent the upper bound (at least for the VaR calculated at sufﬁciently hight conﬁdence levels).

In such a case, only the assets with the fatest tails contributes to the behavior of the sum in the large deviation
regime.

1This relation shows that, in general, the VaR calculated for comonotonic assets does not provide an upper bound of the VaR,
whatever the dependence structure the portfolio may be. Indeed, in such a case, we have VaR(X1 + X2) = VaR(X1) + VaR(X2)
while, by lack of coherence, we may have VaR(X1 + X2) ≥ VaR(X1) + VaR(X2) for some dependence structure between X1

2.3.1 Derivation of the multivariate distribution with a Gaussian copula and modiﬁed Weibull mar-

gins

An advantage of the class of modiﬁed Weibull distributions (7) is that the transformation into a Gaussian,
and thus the calculation of the vector y introduced in deﬁnition 1, is particularly simple. It takes the form

where yk is normally distributed . These variables Yi then allow us to obtain the covariance matrix V of the
Gaussian copula :

3.1 Calculation of the VaR

We consider a portfolio made of N assets with all the same exponent c and scale parameters χi, i

In this expression, we have assumed that all the wealth is invested in risky assets and that the risk-free
interest rate equals zero, but it is easy to reintroduce it, if necessary. It just leads to discount VaRα by the
discount factor 1/(1 + µ0), where µ0 denotes the risk-free interest rate.

3.2 Typical recurrence time of large losses

Let us translate these formulas in intuitive form. For this, we deﬁne a Value-at-Risk VaR∗ which is such that
its typical frequency is 1/T0. T0 is by deﬁnition the typical recurrence time of a loss larger than VaR∗. In
our present example, we take T0 equals 1 year for example, i.e., VaR∗ is the typical annual shock or crash.
Expression (49) then allows us to predict the recurrence time T of a loss of amplitude VaR equal to β times

exponential distributions than for super-exponential ones.

4 Optimal portfolios

In this section, we present our results on the problem of the efﬁcient portfolio allocation for asset distributed
according to modiﬁed Weibull distributions with the different dependence structures studied in the previous
sections. We focus on the case when all asset modiﬁed Weibull distributions have the same exponent c, as
it provides the richest and more varied situation. When this is not the case and the assets have different
exponents ci, i = 1, ..., N , the asymptotic tail of the portfolio return distribution is dominated by the asset
with the heaviest tail. The largest risks of the portfolio are thus controlled by the single most risky asset
characterized by the smallest exponent c. Such extreme risk cannot be diversiﬁed away. In such a case, for
a risk-averse investor, the best strategy focused on minimizing the extreme risks consists in holding only the
asset with the thinnest tail, i.e., with the largest exponent c.

4.1 Portfolios with minimum risk

Let us consider ﬁrst the problem of ﬁnding the composition of the portfolio with minimum risks, where
the risks are measured by the Value-at-Risk. We consider that short sales are not allowed, that the risk free
interest rate equals zero and that all the wealth is invested in stocks. This last condition is indeed the only
interesting one since allowing to invest in a risk-free asset would automatically give the trivial solution in
which the minimum risk portfolio is completely invested in the risk-free asset.

The problem to solve reads:

In some cases (see table 1), the prefactor ξ(α) deﬁned in (52) also depends on the weight wi’s through λ−
deﬁned in (46). But, its contribution remains subdominant for the large losses. This allows to restrict the
minimization to ˆχ instead of ξ(α)2/c

ˆχ.

The composition of the optimal portfolio is continuous in c at the value c = 1. This is the consequence
of the continuity as a function of c at c = 1 of the scale factor ˆχ for a sum of independent variables. In
this regime c

ξ(α)2/c since the scale factor ˆχ remains constant.

4.2 VaR-efﬁcient portfolios

We are now interested in portfolios with minimum Value-at-risk, but with a given expected return µ =

we then will discuss the consequences of the introduction of a risk-free asset in the portfolio.

In contrast with the research of the minimum risk portfolios where analytical results have been derived, we
need here to use numerical methods in every situation. In the case of super-exponential portfolios, with or
without dependence between assets, the gradient method provides a fast and easy to implement algorithm,
while for sub-exponential portfolios or portfolios made of comonotonic assets, one has to use the simplex
method since the minimization problem is then linear.

Thus, although not as convenient to handle as analytical results, these optimization problems remain easy to
manage and fast to compute even for large portfolios.

4.2.2 Portfolios with risky asset

Expression (83) shows that the efﬁcient frontier is simply a straight line and that any efﬁcient portfolio is
the sum of two portfolios: a “riskless portfolio” in which a fraction w0 of the initial wealth is invested and
w0) of the initial wealth invested in risky assets. This provides another
a portfolio with the remaining (1
example of the two funds separation theorem. A CAPM then holds, since equation (84) together with the
market equilibrium assumption yields the proportionality between any stock return and the market return.
However, these three properties are rigorously established only for a zero risk-free interest rate and may not
remain necessarily true as soon as the risk-free interest rate becomes non zero.

Finally, for practical purpose, the set of weights w∗
rate µ0, can be used to initialize the optimization algorithms when µ0 does not vanish.

5 Conclusion

The aim of this work has been to show that the key properties of Gaussian asset distributions of stability
under convolution, of the equivalence between all down-side riks measures, of coherence and of simple
use also hold for a general family of distributions embodying both sub-exponential and super-exponential
behaviors, when restricted to their tail. We then used these results to compute the Value-at-Risk (VaR) and
to obtain efﬁcient porfolios in the risk-return sense, where the risk is characterized by the Value-at-Risk.
Speciﬁcally, we have studied a family of modiﬁed Weibull distributions to parameterize the marginal distri-
butions of asset returns, extended to their multivariate distribution with Gaussian copulas. The relevance to
ﬁnance of the family of modiﬁed Weibull distributions has been proved in both a context of conditional and
unconditional portfolio management. We have derived exact formulas for the tails of the distribution P (S)
of returns S of a portfolio of arbitrary composition of these assets. We ﬁnd that the tail of P (S) is also
asymptotically a modiﬁed Weibull distribution with a characteristic scale χ function of the asset weights
with different functional forms depending on the super- or sub-exponential behavior of the marginals and
on the strength of the dependence between the assets. The derivation of the portfolio distribution has shown
the asymptotic stability of this family of distribution with the important economic consequence that any
down-side risk measure based upon the tail of the asset returns distribution are equivalent, in so far as they
all depends on the scale factor χ and keep the same functional form whatever the number of assets in the
portfolio may be. Our analytical study of the properties of the VaR has shown the VaR to be coherent. This
justiﬁes the use of the VaR as a coherent risk measure for the class of modiﬁed Weibull distributions and
ensures that portfolio optimization problems are always well-conditioned even when not fully analytically
solvable. The Value-at-Risk and the Expected-Shortfall have also been shown to be (asymptotically) equiv-
alent in this framework. In ﬁne, using the large class of modiﬁed Weibull distributions, we have provided
a simple and fast method for calculating large down-side risks, exempliﬁed by the Value-at-Risk, for assets
with distributions of returns which ﬁt quite reasonably the empirical distributions.

We can now show that under the assumptions stated above, the leading order expansion of PS(S) for large
S and ﬁnite N > 1 is obtained by a generalization of Laplace’s method which here amounts to remark that
the set of x∗

where σ(S) is nothing but a Lagrange multiplier introduced to minimize the expression
the constraint
as S
∞
(proposition 2), expression (106) shows that σ(S) goes to inﬁnity with S, as long as the weight of the asset
1 is not zero. Putting the divergence of σ(S) with S in expression (106) for i = 2, ..., N ensures that each
x∗
i increases when S increases and goes to inﬁnity when S goes to inﬁnity.

and that the χi’s are all equal to one, in order not to cumber the notation. As in the proof of corollary 2, it
will be sufﬁcient to replace wi by wiχi to reintroduce the scale factors.

Under the Gaussian copula assumption, we obtain the following form for the multivariate distribution :

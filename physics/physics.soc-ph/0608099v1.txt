Abstract

We introduce a deterministic dealer model which implements most of the empirical laws, such

as fat tails in the price change distributions, long term memory of volatility and non-Poissonian

intervals. We also clarify the causality between microscopic dealers’ dynamics and macroscopic

market’s empirical laws.

INTRODUCTION

Mathematical models of open markets can be categorized into two types. In one type, the

market price time series are directly modeled by formulation such as a random walk model,

ARCH and GARCH models[1][2], and the potential model[3][4][5]. The other type is the

agent-based model which creates an artiﬁcial market by computer programs[6][7][8]. The

agent-based model is able to clarify the relationship between dealers’ actions and market

price properties. Just like the simple ideal gas model reproducing basic properties of real

gas, we can expect that simple dealers’ actions can reproduce the empirical laws of market

prices.

In this paper we systematically introduce 4 deterministic dealer models in order to clarify

the minimal actions of dealers to satisfy the empirical laws of markets. These are revised

models of so-called the threshold model which is originally introduced by one of the au-

thors (H.T) and coworkers[9] in order to demonstrate that dealers’ simple actions can cause

deterministic chaos resulting the market price apparently random even the dealers’ actions

are completely deterministic. We revise the model step by step to reconstruct most of the

empirical laws.

2.1. The model-1

2. CONSTRUCTION OF THE DEALER MODEL

We start with the model-1, the simplest model. In this model, dealers’ dynamics is deﬁned

by the following diﬀerential equation;

dbi
dt′ = σici

(1)

where σi indicates

In the dealer model, the i-th dealer oﬀers the limit price which consists of bid price(bi)

and ask price(ai). For simplicity we assume that the value of spread is a constant(L), so the

σi = 


+1 buyer

−1

seller



2

ask price(ai) is given by ai = bi + L. If a dealer wants to buy(σi = +1) but the transaction

was unsuccessful, he will raise his price at a given rate ci until he can actually buy. For a

seller(σi = −1) he will reduce his price until he completes a successful transaction. Large

ci means that the i-th dealer is quick-tempered. The values of ci are given randomly as

an initial condition representing each one’s disposition is diﬀerent. This heterogeneity is

important for realizing trades. A trade takes place if the model’s parameters satisfy,

max{bi(t)} − min{aj(t)} ≥ 0

(2)

The market price is quoted between bid and ask prices. We assume that trading dealers

have a minimum unit of yen or dollar. After a trade the seller and the buyer change places.

For example, assume the i-th dealer; he is a buyer(σi = +1) and after making a purchase,

becomes a seller(σi = −1).

Although the dynamics is completely deterministic, apparently the market prices random

walk. By the eﬀect of transactions the limit prices are attracted to each other if the dis-

tance of any two pair of prices exceeds the spread, L. This eﬀect causes negative values of

autocorrelation on the ﬁrst few ticks(FIG. 1-B). Both the autocorrelations of volatility and

transaction interval decay quickly(FIG. 1-C,D). Volatility is deﬁned by the absolute values

of price changes. No volatility clustering can be observed in this model(FIG. 1-A) and the

occurrence of transaction is fairly modeled by a Poisson process. In fact, the model-1 can

be understood as a uniform random noise generator. However, the real market data are

characterized by fat tails in the price change distributions, long volatility correlations and

Non-Poissonian intervals. So, we add a new eﬀect each to the model-2 and model-3.

FIG. 1: Results of the model-1. We set parameters: N (number of dealers)=100, L(spread)=1.0,

dt=0.01, ci=[-0.015,0.015].

2.2. The model-2

In the model-2 we focus on transaction intervals.

In order to make our model closer

to the real market we add so-called the ”self-modulation” eﬀect to the model-1[10]. An

example of the ”self-modulation” eﬀect can be found in FIG. 2 of real data. We use a set

of tick-by-tick data for the Yen-Dollar exchange rates for the 3 month from January 1999

to March 1999. We pay attention to the periods where the frequency of trading is high,

such as 6:00∼11:00 on New York time. The time intervals of transactions tend to make

clusters, namely, shorter intervals tend to follow after shorter intervals, and longer intervals

follow longer intervals. The distribution of transaction time intervals has longer tail than

exponential distribution of Poisson process.

It is known that this eﬀect is well-modeled

by the ”self-modulation” process[10] and that normalized transaction interval by moving
averaged transaction interval becomes white noise. In the model-1 we can ﬁnd Fk = T ′α
k /T ′
(α ∼ 1.25) has same statistical properties to the normalized transaction interval in the
real market. T ′
T ′ is average of T ′α
k

k is transaction interval between (k-1)-th and k-th ticks in the model-1 and

. So we modulate this noise and we can reproduce the transaction

4

interval having the same properties to transaction interval in the real market. Mathematical

expression is given by

dbi
dt

=

1
Gk < Tk >τ

σici

dt = Gk < Tk >τ dt′






(3)

Here, Gk = T

′β
k /T ′ (β = α − 1.0). The model-2 has two time axes, t′ and t. t′ is the same
time axes of the model-1. On the other hand t takes into account the ”self-modulation”
eﬀect. t′ is the normal time step in the simulation and t corresponds to real time. < Tk >τ

is a moving avarage of Tk which is for last τ seconds. So, the term of dt in Eq.(3) depends on

< Tk >τ , in other words dt relies on the past transaction intervals. This is ”self-modulation”

process in mathematical expression.

By adding this eﬀect random intervals of the model-1 are modulated and the distribution

of intervals has fat tails(FIG. 3), thus becoming closer to the real data.

Transaction interval

FIG. 3: Comparison of transaction intervals between the model-1 and model-2. The left ﬁgure rep-

resents transaction intervals like Fig.2, and the ﬁgure in the right hand side cumulative distribution

of transaction intervals. In this ﬁgure we normalize transaction intervals by average. In the model-

2 we use the parameters, N (number of dealers)=500, L(spread)=1.0, dt=0.01, ci=[-0.01,0.01] and

τ =150.

2.3. The model-3

In the model-3 we cast a spotlight on the volatility. In the model-1 the distribution of

volatility is exponential as shown in FIG.4. Now we add a new eﬀect to the model-1, namely

the feedback eﬀect of price changes to the dealers. ”Trend-follow” is a tendency of dealers’

action that they predict price rise when the market price has risen. Mathematically we add

a term that is proportional to the latest averaged price change, < dP >η.

The term wj is the j-th weight and W is normalization factor that is, W =

wj. Here, we

assume that dealers’ response to the trends are diﬀerent, and initially the coeﬃcients di are

P

randomly assigned. This causes the tails of distribution of volatility being stretched(FIG.

4). The functional form of this distribution depends on the values of di[11].

FIG. 4: Cumulative distribution of volatility. The values are normalized by average. We can

observe that the tails are shifted by the ”trend-follow” eﬀect. In the model-3 we use the parameters,

N (number of dealers)=100, L(spread)=1.0, dt=0.01, ci=[-0.015,0.015], the value of di is expressed

in the ﬁgure, and < dP > is the latest price change.

2.4. The model-4

pression is given as follows

Finally, we combine the model-2 and model-3 to make the model-4. Mathematical ex-

In the model-4 we set wj = exp(−0.3j) and η = 150. Hence we know that the dealer refers to

the last 150 seconds and the weights decay exponetially[12]. As expected we can reproduce

most of the empirical laws established in real markets. The autocorrelation of price change

decays quickly after a negative value at 1 tick(FIG. 5-C). We can observe that volatility

clearly clusters(FIG. 5-B), and that the autocorrelation of volatility has a long tail similar

to the real data(FIG. 5-D). Also, the distribution of transaction intervals and volatility are

both reasonably close to the real market data(FIG. 5-E,F). Moreover, the diﬀusion property,

the standard deviation as a function of time, is fairly close to that of real data(FIG. 5-G).

3. CONCLUSION

We started with the model-1, a very simple model. Considering why the model-1 diﬀers

from real market data, we added two eﬀects to the model-1, which are feedback eﬀects. One

of them is the ”self-modulation” used in the model-2, and the other is the ”trend-follow”

used in the model-3. The model-4, applying both of the eﬀects, satisﬁes most of the empirical

laws. It should be noted that each dealer has only three parameters describing his character.

Finally, we summarize our results in TABLE I .

Sato and Takayasu already showed that the dealer model’s price ﬂuctuations can be

approximated by ARCH model in some conditions[13]. Such approach of connecting the one

type of market models to another will be fruitful study in the near future.

Abstract

We look at the evolution through rewiring of the degree distribution of a network
so the number edges is constant. This is exactly equivalent to the evolution of prob-
ability distributions in models of cultural transmission with drift and innovation, or
models of homogeneity in genes in the presence of mutation. We show that the mean
ﬁeld equations in the literature are incomplete and provide the full equations. We
then give an exact solution for both their long time solution and for their approach to
equilibrium. Numerical results show these are excellent approximations and conﬁrm
the characteristic simple inverse power law distributions with a large scale cutoﬀ under
certain conditions. The alternative is that we reach a completely homogeneous solu-
tion. We consider how such processes may arise in practice, using a recent Minority
Game study as an example.

Introduction

The observation of power law probability distribution functions for things as diverse as
city sizes, word frequencies and scientiﬁc paper citation rates has long fascinated people.
Yule, Zipf, Simon and Price [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] provide some, but by no means all, of the classic
examples. Coupled with modern ideas of critical phenomena and self-organised criticality
(see [6] for an introduction) this might suggest that such power laws reﬂect fundamental,
perhaps inviolable, processes behind human behaviour. These are the modern expositions
of ideas that have captivated for centuries as exempliﬁed by Thomas Hobbes1. So when
power laws are mixed with modern icons such as the World Wide Web [8, 9] we have an
intoxicating mixture.

In the context of complex networks, the focus is usually on power laws in the degree
distributions, the property which deﬁnes a ‘scale-free’ network (see [10] for a review and

1Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679) was a philosopher who held that Human beings are physical objects,
sophisticated machines whose functions and activities can be described and explained in purely mechanistic
terms — “The universe is corporeal; all that is real is material, and what is not material is not real” [7].

references). In growing networks, if one connects new vertices to existing vertices chosen
with a probability proportional to their degree (at least this is the dominant behaviour for
large degree) — ‘preferential attachment’ [8, 9] — then the degree distribution for large
degree k is of the form k−γ with a power γ greater than two.

However, note that the degree distribution of a network is an ultra-local property of
its vertices. The neighbours of a vertex at the other end of the edges play no role, it
does not matter that the edge describes some bilateral relationship between two vertices.
This should not be surprising, the older studies such as Simon and Price [3, 4, 5] make
no reference to a network. One may be added easily to their examples and models but it
is not necessary. Conversely, one need not refer to the network of the World Wide Web,
one can just count links on a page. For this reason the model of Simon [3] and that of
Barab´asi, Albert and Jeong [8, 9] are identical despite the fact the latter refer to a network,
the former does not. Thus it is only for convenience that in this paper we will use the
language of complex networks2. One may easily dispense with the network as do many of
our references.

We start by observing that there is much less material on the degree distribution of
networks which don’t grow and their non-network counterparts. The model of Watts and
Strogatz [15] is a primary example of a non-growing network, but it does not produce a
power law. We will focus on models of non-growing networks where the number of edges
E is constant (and non-network equivalents) with power law degree distributions. The
point is that these power laws are invariably simple inverse powers of degree, n(k) ∝ 1/k,
and so quite distinct from those found in most growing models.

Such non-growing models have also been shown to be relevant to a wide range of
examples. For instance it has been used when considering the transmission of cultural
artifacts: the decoration of ceramics in archaeological ﬁnds [16, 17, 18], the popularity of
ﬁrst names [19], dog breed popularity [20], the distribution of family names in constant
populations [21]. Similar models have been used to study the diversity of genes [22]. The
same types of probability distribution have also been seen in a study of the Minority Game
[23] and our model suggests why such features emerge even when there is no explicit
scale-free network. Such rewiring models have also been studied for their own merits
[24, 25]. For deﬁniteness in this paper we will use the language of cultural transmission
[16, 17, 18, 19, 20].

The Model

Consider a simple bipartite model3 with E ‘individual’ vertices, each with one edge4
running to any one of N ‘artifact’ vertices, as shown in Figure 1 . The degree of the artifact
vertices is k indicating that one artifact has been ‘chosen’ by k distinct individuals. The
rewiring will be of the artifact ends of the edges, so each individual is always connected to
the same edge. It is the degree distribution of the artifact vertices which we will consider
so n(k) is the number of artifacts each of which has been chosen by k individuals. The
probability distribution of interest is then p(k) = n(k)/N .

At each time step we make two choices but initially no changes to the network. First
we choose an individual at random5 and consider its single link. This is equivalent to
2There are some suggestions about how such a power law might emerge only because of the network

structure [11, 12, 13, 14].

3We have considered other types of network and the generalisations are straightforward.
4The degree of the ‘individuals’ does not eﬀect the derivations and is only relevant to the interpretation.
5We adopt the common convention that ‘random’ without further qualiﬁcation indicates that a uniform

choosing an edge at random. It is also equivalent to picking an artifact vertex with pure
preferential attachment, that is with probability proportional to its degree. We indicate
the probability of choosing a particular artifact at this stage as ΠR since we are going to
remove this edge from this artifact.

The edge chosen is going to be attached to another artifact vertex picked with proba-
bility ΠA. This is the second choice we have to make and it will be done with a mixture
of preferential attachment and random artifact vertex choice. In a fraction pr of the at-
tachment events we chose a random artifact vertex to receive the rewired edge. In the
context of studies of cultural transmission [16, 17, 18, 19, 20] this corresponds to innova-
tion, while in gene evolution it is mutation [22]. Alternatively with probability pp we use
preferential attachment to ﬁnd a new artifact vertex for attachment. This is copying of the
choice previously made by another individual, drift in the work on cultural transmission
[16, 17, 18, 19, 20], while it is the inheritance mechanism in models of gene [22] or family
name [21] homogeneity. If these are the only types of event pp + pr = 1, the number of
artifacts N is constant and

ΠR =

ΠA = pr

Note that there is a chance ΠRΠA that we will choose the same artifact vertex for both
attachment and removal and there will then be no change in the network.

Finally, once both the artifacts for edge removal and addition have been picked, we

perform the rewiring. The mean ﬁeld equation for evolution of n(k) is then [26]

n(k, t + 1) − n(k, t)

= n(k + 1, t)ΠR(k + 1, t) (1 − ΠA(k + 1))

(2)

We must set n(k) = ΠR(k) = ΠA(k) = 0 for k = −1 and k = E + 1 to ensure this equation
is valid at the boundaries k = 0 and k = E. It is crucial that we include the factors of
(1 − ΠA) and (1 − ΠR) otherwise the behaviour at the boundaries is incorrect. We are

explicitly excluding events where the same vertex is chosen for removal and attachment
in any one rewiring event as they do not change the network but they are likely only if
n(k ∼ E) = 1. Such (1 − Π) terms are missing from other discussions of such models but
the literature usually has n(k ∼ E) ≪ 1 so these factors are negligible. Thus the results
in the literature will be approximately the same as ours in this regime.

We can rephrase this as a Markov process. Consider a vector n(t) where ni(t) =

n(E + 1 − i, t) for i = 1, 2, . . . , E + 1. Then we can think of the equations (2) as

n(t + 1) = Mn(t).

Stationary Solution

The stationary solution for the degree distribution n(k, t) = n(k), the eigenvector associ-
ated with the largest eigenvalue λ1 = 1, can be found by substituting n(k, t) = n(k) into
the evolution equation (2). We then note that if the ﬁrst and third lines are equal then so
are the second and third lines. Thus we look for solutions of the form

n(k + 1)ΠR(k + 1, t) (1 − ΠA(k + 1)) = n(k)ΠA(k, t) (1 − ΠR(k)) .

For prE = N pp we have an exact inverse power law. The power is always below one but
for many values (pr ≪ 1) the power is close to one. This is very diﬀerent from the results
for simple models with growth in the number of edges where demanding that the ﬁrst
moment is ﬁnite, hki < ∞, requires γ > 2.

However the (1 − ΠA) and (1 − ΠR) terms in (2) have led to the second ratio of Gamma

functions which if ppk ≪ E gives an exponential cutoﬀ

However the numerator of this second ratio of Gamma functions becomes very large for

This spike at k = E will dominate the degree distribution. The point where the distribu-
tion has become ﬂat at the upper boundary, so n(E) = n(E − 1) deﬁnes another critical

Thus when pr . 1/E the degree distribution will show a spike at k = E.

Overall we see two distinct types of distribution. For large innovation or mutation

rates, Epr & 1, we get a simple inverse power with an exponential cutoﬀ

n(k) ∝ (k)

−γ exp{−ζk},

pr &

E

This is the behaviour noted in the literature [24, 22, 20, 18, 25] and since Epr & 1 the
formulae of the literature for the power γ and cutoﬀ ζ are a good approximation to the
exact formulae given here. Note that in any one practical example it will be impossible
to distinguish the power law derived from the data from γ = 1. The power drifts away
from one as we raise the innovation rate pr towards one but only at the expense of the
exponential regime starting at lower and lower degree. That is, only when the power is
very close to one can we get enough of a power law to be signiﬁcant.

However as pr is lowered towards zero we get a change of behaviour in the exponential
tail around prE ≈ 1. First we ﬁnd the exponential cutoﬀ ζ −1 moves to larger and larger
values, eventually becoming bigger than E. In fact this second ratio of Gamma functions
becomes equal to one for all k at pr = pr,simple ≈ E−1. At that value of pr = pr,simple
we have no cut oﬀ and we are closest to an exact inverse power law for all degree values.
Slightly below that value of pr the tail starts to rise for pr > pr,crit ≈ E−1. For prE ≪ 1,
i.e. if there has been no random artifact chosen after most edges have been rewired once,
then we will almost certainly ﬁnd one artifact linked to most of the individuals, n(E) ≈ 1.

size of ﬂuctuations are clear from the deviations about the exact solutions.

These exact results for the degree distribution are for the mean ﬁeld equations. These
are only approximations but because in these models there are no correlations between
vertices, they should be excellent approximations. Simulations conﬁrm this as Figures 2
and 3 show.

Figure 3: The degree distribution normalised to n(1) and the fractional error w.r.t. the
exact solution for N = E, Epr = 10.0 and pr = 10−2 (crosses), 10−3 (circles) and 10−4
(stars). Measured after 107 rewiring events, averaged over 103 runs. The tails of the
distributions have few data points and so they show larger ﬂuctuations about the the
mean ﬁeld results, as seen on the right. Despite this, for pr = 10−4 there are clear signs
we have not quite reached equilibrium. Started with n(k = 1) = E but otherwise zero.

New Artifact Addition

The cultural transmission models [16, 17, 19, 18, 20], the gene evolution model of [22] and
the model of family name distributions [21] include another attachment process. There a
new artifact vertex is added to the network with probability ¯p = 1 − pr − pp. The new
artifact receives the edge removed from an existing artifact on the same time step.
In
this case the number of artifacts becomes inﬁnite so most artifacts have no edges. Then
the random attachment becomes completely equivalent to this new process of artifact
addition. Thus the large N , zero hki limit of our equations reproduces this case6. The
degree distribution for k ≥ 1 behaves exactly as above — a simple inverse degree power
law cutoﬀ by an exponential for E(1 − pp) & 1 while for E(1 − pp) . 1 n(E) ≈ 1. In this
model though, when pr = pr,simple we have a degree distribution which is an exact inverse
power law for the whole range of non-zero degrees. Our exact solutions to the mean ﬁeld
equations again ﬁts the data as Figure 4 shows.

Equilibration Rate

So far we have studied only the long time equilibrium distribution of (6) and therefore
the ﬁrst eigenvector of the matrix M of (4) associated with eigenvalue 1. However in
Figure 3 there is clear evidence that the system has not yet reached equilibrium despite
the apparently large number of rewiring events (each edge will have been rewired about
104 times and results were averaged over 100 runs). This should be due to the second
largest eigenvalue λ2 in (6). We conjecture that this is of the form7

λ2 = 1 −

pr
E

.

(23)

6Since n(0) diverges this must be excluded from discussions, but this is straightforward. An alternative

normalisation is needed, such as the number of ‘active’ artifacts NA =

E

k=1 n(k).

7We have subsequently proved this conjecture [27]. In fact all the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of M of

P

(4) have a distinctive pattern which we will report on elsewhere [27].

after 105 rewiring events, and averaged over 104 runs.

We have shown that this is always an eigenvalue of the transition matrix M (4) and checked

The parameter which controls the shape of the distribution for most examples is (prE)
and we expect to see the same shape independent of E. However what is noticable is
that the rate of convergence slows as E2 as we increase E for ﬁxed prE. This is visible in
Figure 3. Figure 5 shows the results are consistent with our prediction in (25).

Conclusions

We have analysed the degree distribution in rewiring network models and equivalent mod-
els which make no reference to a network. We have shown that the mean ﬁeld equations
are diﬀerent from the ones considered in the literature. This makes little diﬀerence for
results quoted when prE ≫ 1 but we have demonstrated that only with the extra terms in
(2) do we get the correct solution for all values of prE. Further we have found the second
eigenvalue and its eigenvector and thus deduced the rate of convergence to the equilibrium
solution. This scales as E2 for ﬁxed prE.

The literature suggests that probability distributions with a simple inverse size form
plus a large scale cut oﬀ, as found in these models, are common. The real question is
whether it is the copying mechanism which leads to such distributions in practice? It
is diﬃcult to understand why in the real world individuals choose a new artifact with a

5 × 103 (squares), 5 × 104 (stars), 5 × 105 (circles) and 5 × 106 (crosses). The initial
conﬁguration had each artifact connected to one individual and results were averaged over
100 runs. With (prE) = 10 we are close to equilibrium after t = 5 × 103 steps while this
is only roughly true after t = 5 × 105 time steps for (prE) = 0.1, consistent with our
prediction that the equilibration time scale is τ = E/pr.

probability exactly equal to the number of times that artifact has been previously chosen,
preferential attachment. It is known that for growing networks deviations from this law
lead to deviations from power law distributions [28]. Surely in the real world, many
decisions would be inﬂuenced by certain ‘leaders’ in their ﬁelds and we are more likely to
copy their decision than that of other individuals?

In fact copying the choice of others, including that of certain ‘leaders’ may emerge
naturally. Suppose our individuals were connected to each other by a second network,
a ‘contacts’ network.
Individuals could use their contacts by copying the advice of a
friend or a friend of a friend as deﬁned by the network of contacts. This is equivalent to
making a ﬁnite length random walk on the graph of contacts. For growing networks this is
known to be a way that the structure of the graph can self-organise into a scale-free form
[11, 12, 13, 14] even if the random walk is only one step long. In a similar way, for non-
growing networks, we are essentially making a one-step walk on the bipartite graph between
individuals and artifacts, regardless of any network between the individuals. Extrapolating
the results of [14] to the non-growing case suggests that this should be suﬃcient to generate
an eﬀective attachment probability of the form (1). Put simply we expect that whatever
we do, the probability of arriving at one artifact at the end of a random walk is going to
be dominated by the number of routes into that artifact, i.e. its degree.

Such an example may be seen in the the model of the minority game by Anghel
et al. [23]. Their individuals are connected by a random graph and at each time step an
individual copies the best strategy (the artifact in this case) from amongst the strategies of
their neighbouring contacts. The individuals do not choose a random neighbour’s artifact
but the ‘best’ artifact. However if the meaning of best is always changing, as it may be
in the Minority Game or in many examples of fashion, this best choice may be eﬀectively
a random neighbour choice and hence be statistically equivalent to the simple copying
used in our models. Thus even if it appears that the population is inﬂuenced by wise men
or fashion leaders, provided there is little substance to their choices then it may well be
equivalent to simple copying of one person’s choice. It should come as no surprise that

the results for the artifact degree distribution in [23], the popularity of the most popular
strategies, follows a simple inverse power law with a large degree cutoﬀ, exactly as the
simple copying model would give.

Finally one might ask if it is important to get the right classiﬁcation of artifacts to see
the distribution. What if people make choices based on one classiﬁcation but we measure
on another? Do people choose a speciﬁc breed of dog as registered by the dog breeders
association of their country, or do they really choose between small and large dogs, short
or long haired dogs [20]? The classiﬁcation of pottery in archaeology is one imposed on the
record by modern archaeologists. The answer ought to be that the classiﬁcation should
not be important and it is a scaling property of the model and its solutions that this is so.
Suppose we randomly paired all the artifacts but deemed the fundamental process
to be based still on the choice of the original artifacts and their degree. The choice of
edge to remove is unchanged while preferential attachment to the underlying individual
artifacts leads to eﬀective preferential attachment to the artifact pairs. The probability
of an innovation event (pr or ¯p) is unchanged but the probability of choosing a random
artifact pair is double that of choosing a single artifact. However that reﬂects the fact
that the number of artifacts pairs N2 is half the original number of artifacts. Thus we see
that we require that N → N2 = (N/2) but we keep all other parameters the same. In
particular the linear nature of preferential removal and attachment to the artifact pairs
means that the form of both removal and attachment is unchanged. Overall we have
exactly the same equations for the artifact pair degree distribution n2(k) as we did for the
original artifacts. Thus the distribution n(k) of (9) is of the same form with N → (N/2)
being the only change required. However we have seen that for Epr & 1 the shape can
be parameterised in terms of a power γ (10) and an exponential cutoﬀ ζ (12). The latter
is unchanged and while the power does change a little, we have argued that if γ can be
measured, it is likely to be indistinguishable from one in any real data set. So apart from
the overall normalisation, the distribution of artifact choice is essentially independent of
how we choose to classify the artifacts. This stability against the classiﬁcation of the
artifact types is an important feature of the copying models considered here.

Figure 6: Plots of the fractional error of the data of Fig. 5 w.r.t. the exact solution for
(prE) = 10 (left) (prE) = 0.1 (right). With N = E = 103, pp = 1 − pr, ¯p = 0, with the
degree distribution taken at a variety of times: 5 × 103 (squares), 5 × 104 (stars), 5 × 105
(circles) and 5 × 106 (crosses). The initial conﬁguration had each artifact connected to
one individual and results were averaged over 100 runs. With (prE) = 10 we are close to
equilibrium after t = 5 × 103 steps while this is only roughly true after t = 5 × 105 time
steps for (prE) = 0.1, consistent with our prediction that the equilibration time scale is
τ = E/pr.

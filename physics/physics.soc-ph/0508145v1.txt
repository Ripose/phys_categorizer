Abstract. We present a novel model to simulate real social networks of complex interactions, based in a granular
system of colliding particles (agents). The network is build by keeping track of the collisions and evolves in time with
correlations which emerge due to the mobility of the agents. Therefore, statistical features are a consequence only of
local collisions among its individual agents. Agent dynamics is realized by an event-driven algorithm of collisions
where energy is gained as opposed to granular systems which have dissipation. The model reproduces empirical data
from networks of sexual interactions, not previously obtained with other approaches.

1 Introduction

A social network is a set of people, each of whom is acquainted
with some subset of the others. In such a network the nodes (or
vertices) represent people joined by edges denoting acquain-
tance or collaboration. Empirical data of social networks in-
clude networks of scientiﬁc collaboration[1], of ﬁlm actor co-
llaborations[2], friendship networks[3] among some others[4].
One kind of social network is the network of sexual contacts[5,
6,7,8], where connections link those persons (agents) that have
had sexual contact with each other. The empirical investigation
of such networks are of great interest because, e.g. the topo-
logical features of sexual partners distributions help to explain
why persons can have the same number of sexual partners and
yet being at distinct risk levels of contracting HIV [9].

∼

The simplest way to characterize the inﬂuence of each in-
dividual on the network is through its degree k, the number
of other persons to whom the individual is connected. Sexual
contact networks are usually addressed as an example of scale-
free networks[6,7,8,10], because its property of having a tail
in its degree distribution, which is well ﬁtted by a power-law
k−γ, with an exponent γ between 2 and 3. However,
P (k)
another characteristic feature, not taken into account, is that
the small k-region, comprehending the small-k values varies
slowly with k, deviating from the power-law. Moreover, the
size of the small-k region also increases in time, yielding rather
different distributions when considering the number of partners
during a one year period or during the entire life, e.g. for entire-
life sexual contacts, the degree distribution shows that at least
half of the nodes have degree in the small-k region [5,6]. A
model predicting all these different distributions shapes for dif-
ferent time spans is of crucial interest, because the transmission
of diseases occur during the growth mechanism of the network.

In the on-line version two colors represent the two sexual genders and
larger symbols emphasize those which belong to the network (linked
agents).

One of the main difﬁculties for validating a model of sex-
ual interactions is that typical network studies of sexual con-
tacts involve the circulation of surveys, or anonymous ques-
tionnaires, and only the number of sexual partners of each in-
terviewed person is known, not being possible to obtain infor-
mation about the entire network, in order to calculate degree
correlations, closed paths (cycles), or average distance between
nodes.

In this work we propose a model of mobile agents in two
dimensions from which the network is build by keeping track
of the collisions between agents, representing the interactions
among them. In this way, the connections are a result not of
some a priori knowledge about the network structure but of
some local dynamics of the agents from which the complex
networks emerge. Below, we show that this model is suitable

to reproduce sexual contact networks with degree distribution
evolving in time, and we validate the model using contact trac-
ing studies from health laboratories, where the entire contact
network is known. In this way, we are able to compare the num-
ber of cycles and average shortest path between nodes as well
as compare the results with the ones obtained with Barab´asi-
Albert scale-free networks[11], which are well-known models,
accepted for sexual networks[6,7,8]. We start in Sec. 2 by de-
scribing the model of mobile agents, and in Sec. 3 we apply
it to reproduce the statistical features of empirical networks of
sexual contacts. Discussion and conclusions are given in Sec. 4.

2 Model of mobile agents for sexual
interactions

≫

The model introduced below is a sort of a granular system[12],
where N particles with small diameter d represent agents ran-
domly distributed in a two-dimensional system of linear size
√N d (low density) and the basic ingredients are an in-
L
crease of velocity when collisions produce sexual contacts, two
genders for the agents (male and female), and n/N , the frac-
tion of agents that belong to the network, which constitutes an
implicit parameter for the resulting topology of the evolving
the network.

The system has periodic boundary conditions and is ini-
tialized as follows: all agents have a randomly chosen gender,
position and moving direction with the same velocity modulus
v0
. We mark one agent from which the network will be con-
|
|
structed. When the marked agent collides for the ﬁrst time with
another one of the opposite gender, the corresponding collision
is taken as the ﬁrst connection of our network and its colliding
partner is marked as the second agent of the network (Fig. 1a).
Through time, more and more collisions occur, increasing the
size n of the network (Fig. 1b and 1c) till eventually all the
agents composing the system are connected.

Collisions between two agents take place whenever their
distance is equal to their diameter and the collision process
is based on an event-driven algorithm, i.e. the simulation pro-
gresses by means of a time ordered sequence of collision events
and between collisions each agent follows a ballistic trajecto-
ry[13]. Since sexual interactions rely on the sociological ob-
servation[14] that individuals with a larger number of partners
are more likely to get new partners, we choose a collision rule
where the velocity of each agent increases with the number k of
sexual partners. The larger the velocity one agent has the more
likely it is to collide. Moreover, contrary to collision interac-
tions where velocity direction is completely deterministic[15],
here the moving directions after collisions are randomly se-
lected, since in general, sexual interactions do not determine
the direction towards which each agent will be moving after-
wards. Therefore, momentum is not conserved.

Regarding these observations our collision rule for sexual

interactions reads

v(ki) = (kα

with θ a random angle and ex and ey are unit vectors. Col-
lisions which do not correspond to sexual interactions only
change the direction of motion.

Collisions corresponding to sexual interactions, i.e. with a
velocity update as in Eq. (1), are the only ones which produce
links, and occur in two possible situations: (i) between two
agents which already belong to the network, i.e. between two
sexually initiated agents and (ii) when one of such agents ﬁnds
a non-connected (sexually non-initiated) agent. For simplicity,
we do not take into account sexual interactions between two
non-connected agents, and therefore our network is connected
(see the discussion in Sec. 4).

×

When interactions of type (i) and (ii) occur, both the dis-
tribution tail and the small-k region are observed, as shown by
the cumulative distribution Pcum(k) in Fig. 2a. Here, we use a

system of N = 320
tributions are plotted for different stages of the network growth,
namely n = 103, n = 104, n = 5
N .
As one sees, the exponent of the power-law tail and the tran-
sition between the tail and the small-k region increase during
the growth process. These features appear due to the fact that at
later stages most of the collisions occur between already con-
nected agents. Consequently, the average number of partners
increases as well.

If one considers only type-(ii) sexual contacts, the system
reproduces a stationary scale-free network, as shown in Fig. 2b.
In this case the average number of partners, deﬁned as[16]

ber of partners, is always 2 (kmin = 1 and γ = 3). As we show
below, while empirical data of sexual contacts over large peri-
ods have distributions like the ones for regime (i)+(ii), data for
shorter periods (1

10 years) are scale-free (only (ii)).

To stress that, while the power-law tails are also well ﬁtted by
distributions obtained with scale-free networks (dashed lines
in Fig. 4), these distributions have a minimum number of con-
nections (partners) of kmin = 5 for females and kmin = 7
for males, contrary to the real value kmin = 1 also repro-
duced with our agent model. In fact, the model of mobile agents
takes into account not only the power-law tail of these distribu-
tions, but also the small-k region which comprehends the sig-
niﬁcant amount of individuals having only a few sexual part-
ners (k & 1).

Is important to note that in order to reproduce the differ-
ence in the exponents is necessary to have 58% females and
42% males, which is far from the expected difference among
number of females and males in typical human populations,
with ratios of females:males of the order of 1.1. The difference
in the exponents of the distributions tails for males and females
separately, present in the data of sexual surveys, has generated
much controversy and is often considered due to a bias either
of sampling or honest reporting (see Ref. [5] and references
therein). The exponents γm and γf on a bipartite network are
expected to be nearly the same when the percentage of males
and females are similar, as shown in Fig. 5. In each plot ﬁve
different realizations are shown for males (solid lines) and fe-
males (dashed lines). In Fig. 5a, we plot the results for the same
conditions as in Fig. 4 (58% females and 42% males). Taking

Fig. 3. Cumulative distributions, when varying (a) a parameter s of
selectivity which interpolates between Figs.2a and 2b (see text) for
α = 1 and (b) the exponent α in the update velocity rule, Eq. (1),
for s = 0. Here the same stage of growth is considered, namely n =
5 × 104 = 0.5N .

With our model one can easily interpolate between both
interaction regimes, (i)+(ii) and (ii), by introducing a parameter
s of ‘selectivity’, deﬁned as the probability that sexual initiated
agents in case of collision with another initiated agent, have
no sexual contact. Physically, this selectivity accounts for the
intrinsic ability that a node has to select from all its contacts
(collisions) the ones which are sexual. These intrinsic abilities
were already used in other contexts, e.g. as a new mechanism
leading to scale-free networks in cases where the power-law
degree distribution is neither related to dynamical properties
nor to preferential attachment[17]. For s = 0 one obtains the
two regions illustrated in Fig. 2a, namely the small-k region
and the power-law tail, while for s = 1 one obtains the pure
scale-free topology illustrated in Fig. 2b. In Fig. 3a, we show
the crossover between these two regimes.

The shape of the cumulative distributions is also sensible to
the exponent α in the update velocity rule, Eq. (1), as shown in
Fig. 3b. While for small values of α . 1 one gets an exponential-
like distribution, for α & 1.4 the distribution shows that a
few nodes make most of the connections. Henceforth, we ﬁx
α = 1.2.

Having described the model of mobile agents we proceed
in the next section of a speciﬁc application, i.e. modeling em-
pirical networks of sexual contacts.

3 Reproducing networks of sexual contacts

In this Section we will show that, by properly choosing the pa-
rameter values in our model, one can reproduce real data dis-
tributions of sexual contact networks. In Fig. 4 the cumulative
distributions of a real contact network[6] are shown for females
(circles) and males (triangles) separately, based on empirical
data from 2810 persons in a Swedish survey of sexual behav-
ior. The solid lines in Fig. 4 indicate the simulated distributions.
The simulated power-law tails have exponents γm = 2.4 and
γf = 4.0 for males and females respectively, compared with
0.3[6].

the average of the ﬁve curves for each gender yields the curves
shown in Fig. 4. Figures 5b-d show the distributions obtained
for other percentages illustrating that when decreasing the dif-
ference in the ratio females:males difference in the exponents
dissappear. A characteristic feature of our model is that the av-
erage number
of partners increases as the network grows,
which is natural characteristic expected to occur in real sexual
networks according to the observed differences in the shape
of the degree distribution for yearly and entire-life reports of
number of sexual partners [6,7]. This feature is not observed
in scale-free networks, as illustrated in Fig. 6. Of course, that
di-
this growth also indicates non-stationary regimes, where
verges with the network growth. In the next section we explain
how to overcome this shortcoming.

We compare the model, with two empirical networks of
sexual contacts. One network is obtained from an empirical
data set, composed solely by heterosexual contacts among n =
82 nodes, extracted at the Cadham Provincial Laboratory (Man-
itoba, Canada) and is a 6-month block data [19] between Novem-
ber 1997 and May 1998 (Figure 7a sketches this network). The
other data set is the largest cluster with n = 250 nodes in the
records of a contact tracing study [18], from 1985 to 1999, for
HIV tests in Colorado Springs (USA), where most of the reg-
istered contacts were homosexual (see Figure 7b).

Figures 8(a)-(b) show the cumulative distribution of the
number of sexual partners for each of the empirical networks.
For both cases the agent model and scale-free networks with
kmin = 1 can reproduce the distribution of the number of

of the number N of nodes, the number L of connections, the number

coefﬁcient C. The values of these quantities are also indicated for net-

partners. However, the agent model with s = 0.7 reproduces,
as well, the clustering coefﬁcient distribution that we measure
from the empirical network.

The clustering coefﬁcient C(i) of one agent is deﬁned[2]
as the total number of triangular loops of connections passing
through it divided by the total number of connections ki. Aver-
aging C(i) over all nodes with ki neighbors yields the cluster-
ing coefﬁcient distribution C(k). While for the scale-free graph
which better reproduces these empirical data, the clustering co-
efﬁcient is zero, our agent model yields a distribution which
resembles the one observed in the real network (Fig. 8c). This
feature is due to the co-existence of a tree-like substructure and
closed paths (see Figs. 7b).

For both heterosexual and homosexual networks of sexual
contacts, the model of mobile agents reproduces other impor-
tant statistical features, namely the average clustering coefﬁ-
cient C and the number of loops of a given order. Table 1 in-
dicates the number T of triangles (loops composed by three
edges), the number Q of squares (loops with four edges) and
the average clustering coefﬁcients C given by[2] the average
of C(i) over the entire network.

When using the agent model with the same number N of
nodes as in the real networks we obtain similar results for L, T ,
Q and C, as shown in Table 1 (middle), where values represent
averages over samples of 100 realizations. For the heterosex-
ual network there are no triangles due to the bipartite nature of
the network. At the bottom of Table 1 we also show the val-
ues obtained with scale-free networks, for both cases of one
and two genders, whose minimum number of connections was
chosen to be kmin = 2, for which the clustering coefﬁcient dis-
tributions are as close as possible from the distributions of the
real networks. Clearly, the agent model not only yields cluster-
ing coefﬁcient values much closer to the ones measured in the
empirical data, but also does not show the formation of huge

In this paper we presented a new model for networks of com-
plex interactions, based on a granular system of mobile agents
whose collision dynamics is governed by an efﬁcient event-
driven algorithm and generate the links (contacts) between a-
gents. As a speciﬁc application, we showed that the dynamical
rules for interactions in sexual networks can be written as a
velocity update rule which is a function of a power α of the
previous contacts of each colliding agent. For suitable values
of α and selectivity s, the model not only reproduces empirical
data of networks of sexual contacts but also generates networks
with similar topological features as the real ones, a fact that is
not observed when using standard scale-free networks of static
nodes.

Furthermore, our model predicts that the growth mecha-
nism of sexual networks is not purely scale-free, due to inter-
actions among internal agents, having a mean number of part-
ners which increases in time. This should inﬂuence the predic-
tions from models of spreading of infections[16]. Our agent
model offers a realistic approach to study the emergence of
complex networks of interactions in real systems, using only
local information for each agent, and may be well suited to
study networks in sociophysics, biophysics and chemical re-
actions, where interactions depend on speciﬁc local dynamical
behavior of the elementary agents composing the network.

While given promising results the model may be improved
in two particular aspects. First, it should enable the conver-
gence towards a stationary regime with a growth process start-
ing with all possible collisions instead of one particular agents
from which the network is constructed. Second, the depen-
dence of the above results on the velocity rule in Eq. (1) should
be studied in detail, namely for the case of constant velocity
(α = 0). Preliminary results have shown that the stationary
regime is easily obtained with the model above by introducing
a simple aging scheme, while by varying the parameter α one is
able to reproduce other non-trivial degree distributions. More-
over, we introduced the selectivity parameter s to select from
all possibles social interactions (collisions) the ones which are
of sexual nature. Without introducing this selectivity, the model
of mobile agents is able to reproduce other social networks
of acquaintances. These and other questions will be addressed
elsewhere[20].

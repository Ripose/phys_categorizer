Summary. We have studied numerically the statistical mechanics of the dynamic
phenomena, including money circulation and economic mobility, in some transfer
models. The models on which our investigations were performed are the basic model
proposed by A. Dr˘agulescu and V. Yakovenko [1], the model with uniform saving rate
developed by A. Chakraborti and B.K. Chakrabarti [2], and its extended model with
diverse saving rate [3]. The velocity of circulation is found to be inversely related with
the average holding time of money. In order to check the nature of money transferring
process in these models, we demonstrated the probability distributions of holding
time. In the model with uniform saving rate, the distribution obeys exponential
law, which indicates money transfer here is a kind of Poisson process. But when
the saving rate is set diversely, the holding time distribution follows a power law.
The velocity can also be deduced from a typical individual’s optimal choice. In
this way, an approach for building the micro-foundation of velocity is provided. In
order to expose the dynamic mechanism behind the distribution in microscope, we
examined the mobility by collecting the time series of agents’ rank and measured it
by employing an index raised by economists. In the model with uniform saving rate,
the higher saving rate, the slower agents moves in the economy. Meanwhile, all of
the agents have the same chance to be the rich. However, it is not the case in the
model with diverse saving rate, where the assumed economy falls into stratiﬁcation.
The volatility distribution of the agents’ ranks are also demonstrated to distinguish
the diﬀerences among these models.

Key words: Transfer model, Dynamic Process, Money Circulation, Mobility

1 Introduction

Recently, wealth or income distribution has attracted much attention in the
ﬁeld of econophysics [4, 5, 6]. More than 100 years ago, Italian economist
Pareto ﬁrst found that the income distribution follows an universal power law
[7]. However, the economy has undergone dramatic transitions in last century,
some researchers had doubted about if the law still holds in the modern stage
and turned to reexamine the income distribution and its shift by employing

2

income tax data [8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. The empirical analysis showed that in many
countries the income distribution typically presents with a power-law tail, and
majority of the income distribution can be described by an exponential law.
This universal shape of distribution and its shift trigger an increasing inter-
ests in exploring the mechanism behind them. To solve this problem, several
multi-agent models have been developed by applying principles of statistical
mechanics [1, 2, 3, 13, 14, 15]. In these models, economic system is analogized
to the ideal gas, where the agents can be regarded as particles, and money
is just like energy. Therefore, the trading between agents can be viewed as
collisions between particles in the gas. By using such analogy, the developed
approach that applied to the ideal gas system now can be used to study this
kind of economic system. Whatever the trading rule is set in these models, it
is worthy noting that money is always transferred from one agent to another
in the trading process. So this kind of models could be referred as money
transfer models [16].

Leading the search into this issue was a paper by A. Dr˘agulescu and V.
Yakovenko [1]. In their ideal-gas model, the economy is closed and the amount
of money transferred in each round of trading is determined randomly. Their
simulation analysis shows that the steady money distribution follows an ex-
ponential law. Several papers have extended the work by introducing diﬀerent
characteristics into the model and found that diﬀerent trading rule may lead to
diﬀerent shapes of money distribution. A. Chakraborti and B.K. Chakrabarti
examined the case where the agents do not take out all amount of money as
they participate the exchange, but instead they save a part of their money [2].
This case is well grounded in reality, and the ratio they save is called saving
rate hereafter. When the saving rate are the same for all agents, the money
distribution obeys a Gamma law [17]. However, when the agents’ saving rates
are set randomly, the money distribution changes to a Power-law type [3].
A second extension looks at non-conservation. F. Slanina considered a case
that the economy is not conserved but opened, and so he regarded it as in-
elastic granular gases [15]. Some further studies manage to seek for the exact
mathematical solution by using a master equation [18, 19].

In fact, money transfer is a dynamic process. Besides the money distribu-
tion, it possess some other presentations. Thus, investigating the distribution
only can not provide the whole picture of the relationship between the dis-
tribution and the trading rule. Some eﬀorts have been put into the study on
the dynamic mechanism behind the distribution, that opens more windows to
observe how the economy works.

These works can be divided into two parts. One is about how the money
moves in the assumed economy [20, 21, 22]. As we know, the money is not
static even after the money distribution gets steady. They are always trans-
ferred among agents. Naturally, because of the randomness, whether in the
simulations or in the reality, the time interval that money stays in one agent’s
pocket is a random variable which is named as holding time. The introduction

Dynamic Process of Money Transfer Models

of holding time opens a new path to understanding of the circulation velocity
at micro level.

The other one is about how agents’ positions shift in the economy [23]. Like
the money, agents are not static in the transferring process. If the agents are
sorted according to the amount of money they hold, it is found that the rank of
any agent varies over time. This phenomenon is called mobility in economics.
According to economists’ argument, only analysis on the distribution is not
suﬃcient especially when comparing the generating mechanism of income and
the inequality[24, 25].

In addition, the study on the dynamic characters in the proposed models
makes the evaluation criteria more complete. The aim of econophysicists to
develop these models is to mimic the real economy by abstracting its essence.
However, we cannot judge whether such abstraction is reasonable or not de-
pending on the shape of distribution only. Thus, we must take the circulation
and mobility into account when constructing a “good” multi-agent model.

In this paper, the dynamic processes of the transfer models are investigated
by examining the holding time distribution and the degree of mobility. The
models and simulations will be brieﬂy presented in the next section. In the
Sec. 3 and 4, we will show the nature of circulation and mobility in these
models respectively. Finally, we will give our conclusion in Sec. 5.

2 Models and Simulations

We start with the transfer model proposed by A. Dr˘agulescu and V. Yakovenko,
in which the economic system is closed, put it in another way, the total amount
of money M and the number of economic agents N are ﬁxed. Each of agents
has a certain amount of money initially. In each round of trading process,
two agents i, j are chosen to take part in the trade randomly. And it is also
decided randomly which one is the payer or receiver. Suppose the amounts
of money held by agent i and j are mi and mj, the amount of money to be
exchanged ∆m is decided by the following trading rule:

∆m =

ε(mi + mj),

1
2

(1)

where ε is a random number from zero to unit. If the payer cannot aﬀord the
money to be exchanged, the trade will be cancelled. This model is very simple
and extensible which is named as the basic model in this paper.

When A. Chakraborti and B.K. Chakrabarti intended to extend the basic
model, they argued that the agents always keep some of money in hand as
saving when trading. The ratio of saving to all of the money held is denoted
by s and called saving rate in this paper. For all the agents, the saving rates
are set equally before the simulations. Like the trading pattern of the basic
model, two agents i, j are chosen out to participate the trade in each round.

4

Yougui Wang and Ning Ding

Suppose that at t-th round, agents i and j take part in trading, so at t + 1-th
round their money mi(t) and mj(t) change to

mi(t + 1) = mi(t) + ∆m; mj(t + 1) = mj(t) − ∆m,

where

∆m = (1 − s)[(ε − 1)mi(t) + εmj(t)],

and ε is a random fraction. It can be seen that ∆m might be negative. That
means agent i is probably the payer of the trade. This model degenerates
into the basic model if s is set to be zero. In this model, all of agents are
homogenous with the same saving rate. So we call it the model with uniform
saving rate.

This model was further developed by B.K. Chakrabarti’s research group by
setting agents’ saving rates randomly before the simulations and keeping them
unchanged all through the simulations. Likewise, this is called the model with
diverse saving rate. Correspondingly, the trading rule Equation (3) changes
to

∆m = (1 − si)(ε − 1)mi(t) + (1 − sj)εmj(t),

(4)

where si, sj are the saving rates of agent i and j respectively.

Our following investigations on the dynamic phenomena is based on these
three models. The scale is the same for all the simulations: the number of
agent N is 1, 000 and the total amount of money M is 100, 000.

3 Money Circulation

As the medium of exchange, money is held and transferred by people. In the
process of money transferring, if an agent receives money from others at one
moment, he will hold it for a period, and eventually pays it to another agent.
The time interval between the receipt of the money and its disbursement is
named as holding time. We introduce the probability distribution function of
holding time Ph(τ ), which is deﬁned such that the amount of money whose
holding time lies between τ and τ +dτ is equal to M Ph(τ )dτ . In the stationary
state, the fraction of money M Ph(τ ) dτ participates in the exchange after a
period of τ . Then the average holding time can be expressed as

The velocity indicates the speed at which money circulates. Since money is
always spent randomly in exchange, the transferring process can be deemed
as a Poisson type, and the velocity of money can then be written as [20]

This is the statistical expression of the circulation velocity of money in terms
of holding time.

Two caveats to this conclusion are in order. First, we need to observe the
probability density function of holding time to check whether the transfer
of money is a Poisson process. If the assumption is correct, the probability
density function must take the following form

P (τ ) = λe−λτ ,

(7)

where λ corresponds to the intensity of the Poisson process. We have carried
out the measurement of holding time in our previous work [21]. In those sim-
ulations, the time interval between the moments when the money takes part
in trade after t0 for the ﬁrst two times is recorded as holding time, suppos-
ing we start to record at round t0. The data were collected after majority of
money(> 99.9%) had been recorded and over 100 times with diﬀerent random
seeds.

The simulation results are shown in Fig.1. It can be seen the probability
distributions of holding time decay exponentially in the model with uniform
saving rate. This fact indicates that the process is a Poisson process. On the
other case, when the saving rates are set diversely, the distribution changes
to a power-law type.

by the maximum probability respectively.

In the model with uniform saving rate, the monetary circulation velocity
corresponds to the intensity of Poisson process, which is negatively related to
the saving rate. Form Fig. 1 we can see that the lower the saving rate is, the

steeper the distribution curve. This result is also plotted in Fig. 2, which tells
us the relation between the velocity and the saving rate is not linear.

Saving Rate

Second, the relation between the velocity of money and the average hold-
ing time suggests that the velocity could be investigated by examining how
economic agents make decisions on the holding time of money. There are
many kinds of agents who may have diﬀerent characters when they utilize
money in an economic system, such as consumers, ﬁrms, and investors etc.
We can choose one of them as a representative to examine how their spend-
ing decisions aﬀect the velocity. The typical one is consumers whose behavior
has always been depicted by the life-cycle model prevailed in economics. The
model considers a representative individual who expects to live T years more.
His object is to maximize the lifetime utility

where u(·) is an instantaneous concave utility function, and C(t) is his con-
sumption in time t. The individual has initial wealth of W0 and expects to
earn labor income Y (t) in the working period of his or her life. The main
conclusion deduced from this optimal problem is that the individual wants
to smooth his consumption even though his income may ﬂuctuate in his life
time. From this conclusion, we can also calculate the average holding time of

Dynamic Process of Money Transfer Models

money based on the time path of income and consumption as the following
form

With a few manipulations in a simple version of the life-cycle model [22], we
get

.

(10)

(11)

This result tells us that the velocity of money depends on the diﬀerence be-
tween the expected length of life T and that of working periods T0. It also
implies that the velocity, as an aggregate variable, can be deduced from the
individual’s optimal choice. In this way, a solid micro foundation for velocity
of money has been constructed.

4 Economic Mobility

It is the economists’ consensus that static snapshots of income distribution
alone is not suﬃcient for meaningful evaluation of wellbeing and the equality.
This can be understood easily from a simple example. Suppose in an economy
there are two individuals with money $1 and $2 initially. At the next moment,
the amount of money held by them changes to $2 and $1. The distribution in
this case is unchanged, but the ranks of both agents vary over time. Although
the system seems unequal at either of the two moments in terms of the dis-
tribution, the fact is that the two individuals are quite equal combining these
two moments. Besides, from this simple example, it can also been found that
the structure of economy may vary heavily with an unchanged distribution.
Thus the investigation on mobility is helpful not only to the measurement on
equality but also to the exposure of the mechanism behind the distribution.
We investigated the mobility in the referred transfer models by placing
emphasis on the “reranking” phenomenon. To show this kind of mobility, we
sorted all of agents according to their money and recorded their ranks at the
end of each round. All of data were collected after the money distributions
get stationary and the sampling time interval was set to be 1000 rounds.

The time series of rank in these three models are shown in Fig.3. Then,
we can compare the characters of rank ﬂuctuation of these models. All of the
agents in the basic model and the model with uniform saving rate can be
the rich and be the poor. The rich have the probability to be poor and the
poor also may be luck to get money to be the rich. The mobility in these two
model are quite similar except the ﬂuctuation frequency of the time series.
The economy in the model with diverse saving rate is highly stratiﬁed (see
Fig. 3c). The rich always keep their position, and the poor are doomed to be
the poor. The agents in each level diﬀer in their rank ﬂuctuations. The higher
the agent’ rank, the smaller the variance of his rank.

To compare the mobilities quantitatively, we applied the measurement
index raised by G. S. Fields et al [26]. The mobility between the two sample
recorded in diﬀerent moments is deﬁned as

l(t, t′

| log(xi(t)) − log(xi(t′

))|,

where, xi(t) and xi(t′) are the rank of agent i at t and t′ respectively. It is
obvious that the bigger the value of l, the greater the degree of mobility. To
eliminate the eﬀect of the randomness, we recorded more than 9000 samples
continuously and calculated the value of mobility l between any two consec-
utive samples. The average value of ls in these models are shown in Table
1. It can be found that the degree of mobility decreases as the saving rate

increases in the model with uniform saving rate. The intuition for this result
is straightforward. The larger the ratio agents put aside, the less money they
take out to participate the trade. Then, the less money to lose or win. Thus,
the higher saving rate, the less probability of change in rank or mobility. The
very low degree of mobility in the model with diverse saving rate is due to its
stratiﬁcation.

)−xi(t)
xi(t)

To show more details of the mobility, we also obtain the distribution of
the volatility ( xi(t′
) which is shown in Fig.4. It is noted that the dis-
tributions of the rank variety ratio are quite similar and follow power laws in
the basic model and the model with uniform saving rate. The exponent of the
power-law distribution is found to decrease as the saving rate increases. This
phenomenon is consistent with the alter trend of the index because the higher
the saving rate, the little money is exchanged and the smaller the volatility of
rank. Consequently, when the saving rate increases, the right side of volatility
distribution will shift to the vertical axis, leading to a more steeper tail. From
Fig.4c, we can see that the volatility distribution in the model with diverse
saving rate ends with an exponential tail as the times of simulations increase.

5 Conclusion

The dynamic phenomena of three transfer models, including money circula-
tion and economic mobility, are presented in this paper. The holding time
distributions in these models are demonstrated, and the relation between the
velocity of money and holding time of money is expressed. Studies on this
dynamic process lead us to a good understanding the nature of money cir-
culation process and provide a new approach to the micro-foundation of the
velocity. The “reranking” mobilities in these models are compared graphi-
cally and quantitatively. This observation provide more information about
the dynamic mechanism behind the distribution. Such investigations suggest
that the characters of circulation and mobility should be considered when
constructing a multi-agent model.

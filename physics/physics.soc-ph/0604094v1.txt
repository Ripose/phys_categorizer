Abstract

Under panicky situation, human have tendency to rush toward a
particular direction for escape. I show here that this tendency alone
causes increase in crowding and which could eventually trigger jam-
ming that is not preferable. Further, it is proposed that potential ﬂow
theory can be employed in ﬁnding suitable strategy for escape.

No one would prefer to be present in unstable situation of over-crowding
leading to jamming and stampedes when individuals try to escape the sit-
uation under panic. Unfortunately, panicky situations are not completely
avoidable as they are caused by forces, e.g. ﬁres, whose origins in space and
time remain unpredictable. We could only hope that spaces used by human
and their escape routes were well laid out to avoid any casualty if panicky
situation arises. The designs of layouts and appropriate escape routes require
knowledge and mathematical representation of individual and collective be-
haviors of human during the escape. Based on the knowledge, we could
adopt mainly two kinds of design strategies. In the ﬁrst strategy (referred
to as S1 hereafter), spaces and escape routes can be designed compatible
to the natural behavior of human and without implementing any ways to

change or manipulate human behavior during escape. This kind of strategy
is usually employed in practice (see Ref. [1] and references cited therein). In
the second strategy (referred to as S2 hereafter), the design can incorporate
certain ways to change human behavior and their motions during the escape.
Here, ﬁrst I show that the natural behavior of human would always lead
to over-crowding in S1 strategy and then I describe S2 strategy suggesting
potential ﬂow theory based motions for individuals to avoid or minimize the
over-crowding.

I put myself, in a hypothetical situation, among the people which were
dancing and were dispersed uniformly in a large hall. Suddenly music stopped,
there was a panic, reason unknown, and individuals started rushing directly
toward the entrance, also an only exit for the hall. In the beginning of panic,
I was able to move freely toward the exit with velocity v0
i (t). But soon I
realized that I had to be careful not to bump into someone and my behavior
was implicitly controlled by surrounding individuals and crowd. I started to
have diﬃculty moving directly toward the exit and continued moving with
velocity vi(t) where ever I could, but was always trying hard to reach the
exit. I was not fortunate enough and soon afterward got caught in the jam
situation when the crowd was almost stand still and pushing, each other des-
perately, to squeeze through their way to the exit. People did not remain
gentle then and what happened afterward is left for imagination.

Though I was exhausted, I did realize that I experienced and felt the

Here mi is ith individual’s mass (e.g. my mass), v0

Pj(6=i) fij is sum of anticipated forces to keep myself a safe distance

(if possible) from other surrounding individuals j’s and contact forces dur-
Pw fiw is anticipated force to keep myself away from the

nearest walls, had I been caught between the crowd and walls of the hall.
The Lagrangian Eq. (1) is the most reasonable mathematical description,
available so far, for individual’s behavior under the inﬂuence of surrounding
individuals’ behavior and presence of walls in panicky situation. Helbing et

al. [1] considered a few benchmarks to show the robustness and usefulness
of this equation for designing escape strategy of type S1.

So for strategy S1, now I show that the behavior governed by Eq. (1)
would always result in over-crowding if every individual in the hall rushes
directly toward the exit. For the discussion, consider magnitude v0
i (t) of the
intended velocity to be identical for all individuals, independent of time and
equal to v0. But the unit direction vector e0
i (t) would be diﬀerent depending
on the position of the individual with respect to the exit. Also, consider ﬂoor
of the hall in x
y and exit
of the hall at the origin. Every individual’s position can then be given by
coordinates (x, y) and thus the intended velocity, directly toward the origin,
of any individual located at (x, y) can be given by the Eulerian velocity ﬁeld
v0(x, y, t), written as

where ˆi and ˆj are unit vector along the x and y axes, respectively. Using
the usual recipe of Kinetic Theory approach, Eulerian equations for number
density N(x, y, t) of people and number weighted velocity ﬁeld V(x, y, t) can

be obtained by using Eq.
position vector Ri(t) of each individual. The governing equation for N and

where v0(x, y, t) is any intended velocity ﬁeld (e.g. as given by Eq. 2) and
Vc accounts for the velocity due to forces fij and fiw. While writing Eq. (4),
time scale τi for all individuals is assumed to be identical. The three terms
on the right hand side (rhs) of Eq. (4) can be considered as zeroth order,
ﬁrst order and second order velocity terms, respectively, based on the order
in which corresponding events causing these diﬀerent velocities occur.

In the beginning of the panicky situation (Stage I) when I was able to

move freely, Vc = 0 and I immediately gained intended velocity, i.e.

as suggested by Eq. (4). In the beginning of Stage II, when I was avoiding
collision with other individuals and was adjusting myself with small response
or characteristic time scale τi, Vc was negligible. For this stage, Eq. (4)
along with perturbation expansion around v0(x, y, t) suggest

V(x, y, t) ∼= v0(x, y, t)

These velocity ﬁelds of initial two stages are suﬃcient to show increase in
over-crowding or in number density.

Now during Stage I, Eqs. (2) and (5) provide divV =

v0/√x2 + y2 and

its substitution into Eq. (3) yields

DN/Dt = v0N/qx2 + y2 > 0,

suggesting increase in number density N in time. This increase continues
in time during the beginning of the Stage II. It should be noted that an
additional τi containing term on the rhs of Eq. (6) can not reduce or increase
the rate of increase, as div[( ∂
)v0] = 0 when Eq. (2) is used for v0.
· ∇
This exhibits clearly that individuals’ intentions to rush directly toward the
exit is a main cause for increase in time of the number density of people i.e.
over-crowding.

∂t + v0

Now I describe strategy S2. The cause of over-crowding is due to the com-
pressible nature of the velocity ﬁeld V, i.e. non-zero value for divV. The
intended velocity ﬁeld v0 arising from human’s natural tendency is compress-
ible too. So in order to avoid over-crowding and subsequent triggered events,
the ﬁrst required condition is that velocity ﬁeld V should be incompressible
i.e. divV = 0. Further, during escape I would not prefer to be moving in a
circle again and again inside the hall. Thus, the second required condition
of zero circulation suggests curlV = 0. These two conditions suggest the
velocity ﬁeld to be identical to that of inviscid, incompressible, irrotational
ﬂuid ﬂow or potential ﬂow, written in terms of a velocity potential function
φ as

V = grad φ,

2φ = 0.

Thus, if individuals move along the streamlines of appropriate potential ﬂow
with suitable speed, triggering of over-crowding and subsequent disastrous
events can be altogether avoided. There is a possibility that a few individuals
may not move exactly as required and perturbation in their behaviors arise

due to ﬁnite response time to follow streamlines. The strategy S2 can then
be further reﬁned by using strategy S1. To do that, potential velocity ﬁeld
can be considered as intended velocity v0 in the framework of S1. The over-
crowding will be caused at ﬁrst order by the compressible nature of the second
term on the rhs of Eq. (6). So for potential velocity ﬁeld v0, divergence of
Eq. (6) yields

where each term on the rhs is proportional to square of diﬀerent strain rate.
The Eqs. (9) and (3) suggest that over-crowding is likely to occur in the
region of high strain rate of potential velocity ﬁeld. Though it is not possible
to have these strain rates zero everywhere, spaces and escape routes should be
designed in a manner to minimize, as far as possible, areas of high strain rates
in the potential velocity ﬁeld. In addition, the quick response of human, i.e.
small value for τi, would be an added advantage to reduce the over-crowding.
By now, we know suitable strategy. Now, important questions arise:
How to implement S2 strategy in reality? How to manipulate individuals’
behaviors for their own advantage during escape so they quickly respond
and move in, already established, streamlines pattern in panicky situations?
I leave these diﬃcult tasks for my fellow engineers to come up with clever
ways, including and other than, marking streamlines of appropriate potential
ﬂow on the ﬂoor, using moving/ﬂashing lights for speed at every location to
guide individuals during escape.

We show analytically that abrupt structural transitions can arise in functionally optimal networks,
driven by small changes in the level of transport congestion. Our ﬁndings are based on an exactly
solvable model system which mimics a variety of biological and social networks. Our results oﬀer
an explanation as to why such diverse sets of network structures arise in Nature (e.g. fungi) under
essentially the same environmental conditions. As a by-product of this work, we introduce a novel
renormalization scheme involving ‘cost motifs’ which describes analytically the average shortest path
across multiple-ring-and-hub networks.

There is much interest in the structure of the complex
networks which are observed throughout the natural, bi-
ological and social sciences [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11].
The physics community, in particular, hopes that a cer-
tain universality might exist among such networks. On
the other hand, the biological community knows all
too well that a wide diversity of structural forms can

arise under very similar environmental conditions.
medicine, cancer tumors found growing in a given organ
can have very diﬀerent vascular networks. In plant biol-
ogy, branching networks of plant roots or aerial shoots
from diﬀerent species can co-exist in very similar en-
vironments, yet look remarkably diﬀerent in terms of
their structure. Mycelial fungi [12] provide a particu-
larly good example, as can be seen in Figs. 1(a) and
1(b) which show diﬀerent species of fungi forming net-
works with varying degrees of lateral connections (anas-
tomoses). Not only do fungi represent a wide class
of anastomosing, predominantly planar, transport net-
works, but they have close parallels in other domains,
including vascular networks, road and rail transport sys-
tems, river networks and manufacturing supply chains.
But given that such biological systems could adapt their
structures over time in order to optimize their functional
properties, why do we observe such diﬀerent structures
as shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) under essentially the
same environmental conditions?

Here we address this question by showing that quite
diﬀerent network structures can indeed share very sim-
ilar values of the functional characteristics relevant to
growth. We also show analytically that small changes
in the level of network congestion can induce abrupt
changes in the optimal network structure.
In addition
to the theoretical interest of such phase-like structural
transitions, our results suggest that a natural diversity
of network structures should arise under essentially the
same environmental conditions – as is indeed observed
for systems such as fungi (see Figs. 1(a) and (b)). As a
by-product of this analysis, we provide a novel renormal-
ization scheme for calculating analytically the average

shortest path in multiple ring structures.

Our analytically-solvable model system is inspired by
the transport properties of real fungi (see Fig. 1(c)).
A primary functional property of an organism such as
a fungus, is to distribute nutrients eﬃciently around its
network structure in order to survive. Indeed, fungi need
to transport food (carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phospho-
rous (P)) eﬃciently from a localized source encountered
on their perimeter across the structure to other parts of
the organism. In the absence of any transport congestion
eﬀects, the average shortest path would be through the
center – however the fungus faces the possibility of ‘food
congestion’ in the central region since the mycelial tubes
carrying the food do not have inﬁnite capacity. Hence the
organism must somehow ‘decide’ how many pathways to
build to the center in order to ensure nutrients get passed
across the structure in a reasonably short time. In other
words, the fungus – either in real-time or as a result of
evolutionary forces – chooses a particular connectivity
to the central hub. But why should diﬀerent fungi (Figs.
1(a) and (b)) choose such diﬀerent solutions under essen-
tially the same environmental conditions? Which one is
‘right’ ? Here we will show that, surprisingly, both fungi
can be right at the same time.

Figure 1(d) shows our model’s ring-and-hub structure.
Although only mimicking the network geometry of natu-
rally occurring fungi (Figs. 1(a) and (b)), it is actually a
very realistic model for current experiments in both fun-
gal and slime-mold systems. In particular, experiments
have already been carried out with food-sources placed
at peripheral nodes for fungi (Fig. 1(e)) and slime-mold
[13] with the resulting network structures showing a wide
range of complex morphologies [13]. We use the term
‘hub’ very generally, to describe a central portion of the
network where many paths may pass but where signiﬁ-
cant transport delays might arise. Such delays represent
an eﬀective cost for passing through the hub. In practice,
this delay may be due to (i) direct congestion at some
central junction, or (ii) transport through some central
portion which itself has a network structure (e.g. the in-

ner ring of the Houston road network in Fig. 1(f)). We
return to this point later on.

time delay for passing through the center can be repre-
sented equivalently as an additional path-length. This
additional path-length is given by c which can be taken
to be a general function of the system parameters. It can
then be shown that the probability P (ℓ) that the short-
est path between a pair of nodes on the perimeter is ℓ, is
given (when averaged over all pairs of nodes) by:

P (ℓ) = 


1 + (ℓ − c − 1)p+
(n − 1 − ℓ)(ℓ − c)p2
(cid:2)

n−1



∀ ℓ ≤ c

∀ ℓ > c .

(1 − p)ℓ−c−1
(cid:3)

This expression is valid for c < n, since for c ≥ n the
shortest path is trivially around the ring itself. The av-
n−1
erage shortest path is now given by ¯ℓ =
ℓ=1 ℓP (ℓ).
Performing the relevant summations yields:

¯ℓ(p, n, c) =

(1 − p)n−c

which shows explicitly the parameter dependences of
¯ℓ. The non-trivial algebraic structure of this expression
shows that the congestion cost c cannot be treated in
a simple perturbation scheme – in particular, the term
(1 − p)n−c represents an inﬁnite summation of such per-
turbative terms.

In Ref.

We now consider the functional form of ¯ℓ for diﬀerent
cost functions c.
[10] we examined the trivial
cases of ﬁxed, linear and quadratic costs. Here we show
that for more general non-linear cost-functions, a novel
and highly non-trivial phase-transition can arise. First
we consider the case of a general cubic cost function:

c(ρ) = Aρ3 + Bρ2 + Cρ + D,

(2)

where ρ is the scaled probability, ρ = pn and A, B, C, D ∈
R.
In order to demonstrate the richness of the phase
transition and yet still keep a physically reasonable
model, we choose the minimum in this cubic function to
be a stationary point. Hence the cost function remains a
monotonically increasing function, but features a regime
of intermediate connectivities over which congestion costs
remain essentially ﬂat (like the ‘ﬁxed charge’ for London’s
congestion zone). Since we are primarily concerned with
an optimization problem, we can set the constant D = 0.
Hence

c(ρ) = Aρ3 − 3Arρ2 + 3Ar2ρ,

in our model (Fig. 1(d)). (f) The man-made road network in

Building on earlier work [10, 11], we can calculate an-
alytically the distribution of path lengths in a ring-and-
hub structure in which n peripheral nodes (e.g.
food
sources) are connected to the central hub portion with
a probability p. The mean number of radial connections
(i.e. anastomoses in the case of fungi) is equal to np.
Assuming that all the connections are continually trans-
porting objects (e.g. nutrients) at the same speed, any

where r = −B
3A is the location of the stationary point.
Substituting into Eq. (1) yields the shortest path dis-
tribution for this particular cost-function in terms of the
parameters A, r, p and n. The result is too cumber-
some to give explicitly – however we emphasize that it
is straightforward to obtain, it is exact, and it allows
various limiting cases to be analyzed analytically.

FIG. 2: Top: Landscape of the average shortest path length ¯ℓ
(vertical axis) as a function of the cubic cost-function param-
eter A and the average number of connections to the central
hub ρ. Bottom: The value of ρ corresponding to a global
minima in ¯ℓ, as a function of the cubic cost-parameter A.

FIG. 3: Top: Landscape of the average shortest path length
¯ℓ (vertical axis) as a function of the ‘step’ cost-function pa-
rameter r0 and the connectivity ρ. Bottom: The ‘step’ cost-
function as a function of the step-frequency parameter r0 and
ρ. As r0 decreases, the cost-function becomes increasingly
linear.

Figure 2 (top) shows the value of the average shortest
path ¯ℓ for varying values of ρ and A. As can be seen, the
optimal network structure (i.e. the network whose con-
nectivity ρ is such that ¯ℓ is a global minimum) changes
abruptly from a high connectivity structure to a low con-
nectivity one, as the cost-function parameter A increases.
Figure 2 (bottom) shows that this transition resembles
a ﬁrst-order phase transition. At the transition point
A = Acrit, both the high and low connectivity structures
are optimal. Hence there are two structurally inequiva-
lent networks having identical (and optimal) functional
properties. As we move below or above the transition
point (i.e. A < Acrit or A > Acrit respectively) the high
or low connectivity structure becomes increasingly supe-
rior.

We have checked that similar structural transitions can

arise for higher-order nonlinear cost functions. In partic-
ular we demonstrate here the extreme case of a ‘step’
function, where the cost is ﬁxed until the connectivity
to the central hub portion reaches a particular threshold
value. As an illustration, we consider the particular case:

c(ρ, r0) = 50

Sgn(ρ − ir0) + 50

where Sgn(x) = −1, 0, 1 depending on whether x is nega-
tive, zero, or positive respectively, and r0 determines the
frequency of the jump in the cost. Figure 3 (top) shows
the average shortest path ¯ℓ for this step cost-function
(Fig. 3 (bottom)) as ρ and r0 are varied. A multitude of
structurally-distinct yet optimal network conﬁgurations
emerge. As r0 decreases, the step-size in the cost func-
tion decreases and the cost-function itself begins to take

4

the inner-most hub. The case i = 0 is identical to Eq.
(1). As before, pi+1 represents the probability of a link
between rings i + 1 and i and ni+1 is the number of nodes
in ring i + 1. We have checked that this recurrence re-
lation is accurate, using full-scale numerical calculations
of ¯ℓ. Solving this recurrence relation shows that there
are optimal network structures with diﬀerent numbers of
rings and radial connectivities, yet which have the same
average shortest path length across them [14]. Hence, as
before, optimal network structures exist which are struc-
turally very diﬀerent, yet functionally equivalent. Fig-
ure 4 shows an explicit example of two such functionally
equivalent, optimal networks. It is remarkable that these
images are so similar to the real fungi shown in Figs. 1(a)
and (b).

In summary, we have uncovered a novel structural
phase transition within a class of biologically-motivated
networks. Depending on the system of interest (e.g. fun-
gus, or road networks) these transitions between inequiv-
alent structures might be explored in real-time by adap-
tive re-wiring, or over successive generations through evo-
lutionary forces or ‘experience’. An important further
implication of this work is that in addition to search-
ing for a universality in terms of network structure, one
might fruitfully consider seeking universality in terms of
network function.

FIG. 4: Two structurally inequivalent but functionally equiv-
alent networks. The average shortest path across the struc-
ture is the same for both networks, and both networks are
themselves optimal (i.e. minimum ¯ℓ). (a) A single-ring-and-
hub network with a linear cost function. (b) A two-ring-and-
hub conﬁguration. The inner ring-hub structure has the same
cost-function as in (a). The similarity to the real fungi in Figs.
1(a) and (b) is striking.

on a linear form – accordingly, the behavior of ¯ℓ tends
towards that of a linear cost model with a single identi-
ﬁable minimum [10]. Most importantly, we can see that
once again a gradual change in the cost parameter leads
to an abrupt change in the structure of the optimal (i.e.
minimum ¯ℓ) network.

We have allowed our ring-and-hub networks to seek
optimality by modifying their radial connectivity while
maintaining a single ring. Relaxing this constraint to al-
low for transitions to multiple-ring structures yields sim-
ilar ﬁndings. In particular, allowing both the radial con-
nectivity and the number of rings to change yields abrupt
transitions between optimal networks with diﬀerent ra-
dial connectivities and diﬀerent numbers of rings. To
analyze analytically such multiple-ring structures we in-
troduce the following renormalization scheme. Consider
the two-ring-and-hub network in Fig. 1(f). For paths
which pass near the center, there is a contribution to the
path-length resulting from the fact that the inner ring has
a network structure which needs to be traversed. Hence
the inner-ring-plus-hub portion acts as a renormalized
hub for the outer ring. In short, the ring-plus-hub of Eq.
(1) can be treated as a ‘cost motif’ for solving multiple-
ring-and-hub problems, by allowing us to write a recur-
rence relation which relates the average shortest path in
a network with i + 1 rings to that for i rings:

We study the role of public information on player cooperation in the Minority Game. Although the
dynamics of the system depends on what kind of public information is given to the players, we ﬁnd
that the degree of cooperation measured by the so-called variance of attendance per player follows
the same trend. Moreover, we discover that the second order phase transition point separating
the so-called symmetric and asymmetric phases in the Minority Game is robust provided that all
strategies make their choices based on the same set of public information. Besides, the transition
point is found to be independent of the public information.

INTRODUCTION

Many phenomena in a variety of ﬁelds including biol-
ogy and economics can be modeled by agent-based com-
plex adaptive systems (CAS) [1, 2, 3].
In fact, CAS
can be used to gain empirical understanding, normative
understanding, qualitative insight and theory generation
together with methodological advancement in economic
systems. This agent-based approach focuses on the dy-
namics and the eﬀects of the initial or boundary condi-
tions on an economic system as opposed to the conven-
tional economic methodology which concentrates mainly
on the equilibrium state of the system [3]. In this respect,
techniques in statistical physics and non-linear dynamics
can be applied in the study of economic systems. This is
the goal of the rapidly growing ﬁeld of econophysics.

Minority game (MG) [4] is perhaps the simplest agent-
based econophysical model that captures the minority
seeking behavior of independent selﬁsh players. In the
original version of MG, each player picks one out of
two alternatives in each time step based on the pub-
licly posted minority choices of the previous M turns.
Those correctly picking the minority choice are awarded
one dollar while the others are deducted one dollar. Al-
though players in MG are selﬁsh and only aim at max-
imizing their own wealth, they do so in a cooperative
manner. In addition, MG exhibits a second order phase
transition point dividing the parameter space into the so-
called symmetric and asymmetric phases [4, 5]. Besides,
the cooperation phenomenon and the phase transition
point appear to be very robust as they are also observed
in many variants of MG that use more than two alter-
natives [6, 7], evolving strategies [8, 9], diﬀerent payoﬀ
functions [10, 11], diﬀerent network topology [12] and
heterogeneous players [13, 14].

Certain global information on the system is given to
the players in MG so as to establish the necessary feed-
back for cooperation. In almost all variants of MG, the
only global information accessible by each player is the

minority choices of the previous M turns. That is to
say, the public information in these variants provides a
complete description of historical winning choices of the
previous M turns. In fact, the only exception we know is
a series of studies concerning the relevance of history in
MG that was initiated by a paper of Cavagna [15]. So far,
all these studies only compare the eﬀect of replacing the
actual historical winning choices by some fake ones on
the dynamics of MG. For instance, Challet and Marsili
extensively investigated the eﬀect of replacing every his-
torical minority choice by a randomly and independently
chosen bit string on the dynamics of MG. They found
that although the modiﬁed game still shows phase tran-
sition right at the same point in the parameter space, the
dynamics is markedly diﬀerent from the original MG in
the asymmetric phase [16]. Their ﬁndings were echoed
by a recent work of Ho et al. who discovered that the
dynamics of the original and the modiﬁed game also dif-
fer in the symmetric phase [17]. Thus, the real history is
relevant and crucial to the dynamics in many variants of
MG.

Nonetheless, publishing the historical winning choices
of the previous M turns is not the only way to present
certain real global information of the system to players.
For example, it is instructive to investigate what will hap-
pen if every publicly known historical minority choice is
replaced by a publicly known historical majority choice.
In the case of the original MG [4, 5], the statistical prop-
erties of this majority history model is identical to that
of the original MG as the knowledge of the historical
majority choice is equivalent to that of the historical mi-
nority choice. In contrast, the situation is radically dif-
ferent when the number of alternatives in the model is
greater than two. In this paper, we study an extension of
MG that allows players to choose from Nc > 2 alterna-
tives with diﬀerent types of publicly posted real histories.
Our numerical simulations show that the general trend
of the cooperative behavior does not depend on the kind
of common real historical data used even though the dy-

namics of the game and hence the cooperative behavior
amongst players indeed depend on such a choice. More
importantly, we ﬁnd that the second order phase tran-
sition point separating the symmetric and asymmetric
phases is independent of the publicly posted histories.
This ﬁnding can be understood by the crowd-anticrowd
theory proposed by Hart et al. [18, 19].

THE GAME MG(Nc) AND ITS EXTENSION

c

c

Our study focuses on an extension of the MG known
as MG(Nc) proposed by Chau and Chow in Ref. [6]. In
MG(Nc), each of the N players picks one out of Nc alter-
natives independently in each turn where Nc is a prime
power. The choice picked by the least non-zero number
of players is said to be the (1st) minority choice in that
turn. Those who have picked the minority choice will be
awarded one dollar while the others will be deducted one
dollar. The minority choices of the previous M turns are
publicly announced. To aid each player making their de-
cisions, each of them is randomly and independently as-
signed once and for all S deterministic strategies before
the game begins. A strategy is a table that assigns every
possible history (in this case, the 1st minority choice of
the previous M turns) to a choice. In other words, it is a
map from the set of all possible histories H to the ﬁnite
ﬁeld of Nc elements GF (Nc). Clearly, there are totally
N N M
diﬀerent possible strategies and this collection of
strategies is called the full strategy space. To evaluate
the performance of a strategy, a player looks at the vir-
tual score which is the current hypothetical wealth if that
strategy were used throughout the game. Every player
follows the choice of his/her current best working strat-
egy, namely, the one with the largest virtual score, to pick
an alternative [6]. (In case of a tie, the player randomly
picks one from his/her pool of best working strategies.)
Now, we consider a generalization of the MG(Nc)
model known as MGsub(Nc), where the subscript “sub”
describes the kind of historical choices used. When
sub = min(q), we publicly announce the historical qth
minority choices of the past M turns instead of the his-
torical 1st minority choices. (More precisely, we arrange
those alternatives chosen by non-zero number of play-
ers in ascending order of the number of players chosen.
Those alternatives with equal number of players cho-
sen are arranged randomly in this sequence. The qth
minority choice is the qth alternative in this sequence.
In the event that the number of alternatives chosen by
non-zero number of players is less than q, we deﬁne the
qth minority choice as the last entry in this sequence.)
Similarly, when sub = maj(q), we publish the histori-
cal qth majority choices of the past M turns. We call
the publicly announced alternatives the history string ir-
respective of the state “sub”. Moreover, we stress that

2

apart from the global information released, all the rules
in MGsub(Nc) are the same as those of MG(Nc). Thus,
MG(Nc) =MGmin(1)(Nc).

NUMERICAL RESULTS

Following Refs. [4, 6], we measure the degree of player
cooperation by considering the mean variance of atten-
dance over all alternatives (or simply the mean variance)

where the attendance of an alternative Ai(t) is the num-
ber of players picking the alternative i at turn t. Note
that h· · ·it and h· · ·iΞ are the expectation values aver-
aged over time and over strategies initially assigned to
the players respectively. The smaller the Σ2, the better
the player cooperates. More importantly, for a ﬁxed S
and up to ﬁrst order approximation, Σ2 depends only on
the control parameter α = N M+1
/N S which measures
the relative diversity of the strategies used in the system
[20].

Furthermore, to investigate the phase diagram of
MGsub(Nc), we follow Refs. [7, 21] to study the order

where hp(Ω|µ)it denotes the time average of the proba-
bility that the current minority choice is Ω conditioned
on a global history string µ.

Fig. 1 plots Σ2/N and θ as a function of α for diﬀerent
“sub” and Nc. Each data point presents the average value
over 1000 diﬀerent runs and the value for each run is aver-
aged over 25000 iterations after discarding the ﬁrst 20000
iterations to allow equilibration. We ﬁnd that within the
range of parameters we have simulated, the system in-
deed equilibrates well before the ﬁrst 20000 iterations.
All Σ2/N curves in Fig. 1 show a similar trend and have
cusps irrespective of the values of Nc and “sub” used;
and the θ curves indicate second order phase transitions
around the cusps. Although we only show those curves
for Nc = 5 and 7, similar behaviors are observed for other
values of Nc > 2. In fact, our numerical simulations show
that the critical points of all curves with the same Nc and
S coincide. That is to say, the critical value αc is a func-
tion of Nc and S only and is independent of the kind of
history string used. Besides, Σ2/N
αc is a function of
Nc and S only. The behavior of Σ2/N away from the
phase transition point αc is also worth mentioning. For
α ≪ αc, the variance per player for sub = min(1) is con-
sistently greater than those obtained in MGs using other
public information. In contrast, for α & αc, Σ2/N for
sub = maj(1) is consistently smaller than those obtained
in MGs using other globally announced information.

THE CROWD-ANTICROWD EXPLANATION

the crowd-anticrowd theory developed by Hart et al.

correlated if the probability for them to make the same

choice equals 1/Nc when averaged over the set of all pos-
sible history string. And two strategies are called anti-
correlated if they make diﬀerent choices for every input
history string. Besides, two strategies are said to be sig-
niﬁcantly diﬀerent if they are either anti-correlated or
uncorrelated. In fact, one can form a subset of N M+1
strategies from the full strategy space in such a way that
any two distinct strategies in this subset are signiﬁcantly
diﬀerent. Besides, the size of this subset is maximal in the
sense that no such subset with more than N M+1
strate-
gies exists. This subset is called the maximal reduced
strategy space [5, 6, 18, 19]. Most importantly, numer-
ical simulations show that the dynamics of the game,
including MG“sub”(Nc), for strategies taken from the full
or from the maximal reduced strategy spaces are similar.
From the discussions in Refs. [6, 18, 19], one may la-
bel a strategy in the maximal reduced strategy space by
(λ, β) ∈ GF (N M
c ) × GF (Nc) in such a way that two
strategies (λ, β) and (λ′, β′) are uncorrelated if and only
if λ 6= λ′. They are anti-correlated if and only if λ = λ′
and β 6= β′. They are the same if and only if λ = λ′
and β = β′. According to the crowd-anticrowd theory,
the mean variance of attendance Σ2 in MG(Nc) is gov-
erned by an ensemble of mutually uncorrelated sets of
anti-correlated strategies [6, 18, 19]. That is to say,

Near the point of maximal cooperation, the number of

c

regime, the number of players using strategies (λ, β) and
(λ, β′) are always about the same for all β 6= β′. Thus,
from Eq. (3), the small variance at the point of maximal
cooperation is the result of an optimal crowd-anticrowd
cancellation [6, 18, 19]. Recall that two anti-correlated
strategies always give diﬀerent suggestions irrespective of
the history string. So, the location of the second order
phase transition point αc is independent of the history
string generation method “sub”.

Let us move on to discuss the situation of α ≪ αc, the
so-called symmetric phase. In this regime, there is a pe-
riodic dynamics in the time series of the minority choice.
And according to the crowd-anticrowd theory, this dy-
namics leads to a large mean variance of attendance per
player Σ2/N in MGmin(1)(Nc) [18, 19, 20, 22, 23]. Let
us brieﬂy review the origin of this periodic dynamics in
MGmin(1)(Nc). When the number of strategies at play
is much larger than the maximal reduced strategy space
size N M+1
, it is very likely for players to employ similar
c
strategies.
Initially, for a given history string µ, every
alternative has equal probability of being the minority.
Moreover, the virtual score of a strategy (λ, β) that gives
the correct prediction of the minority is increased while
that of its anti-correlated strategies are decreased. As
there are more players than the maximal reduced strat-
egy space size, in the next occurrence of the same his-
tory string µ, more players may use (λ, β) to pick their
alternatives. Thus, (λ, β) cannot predict the minority
choice correctly due to overcrowding of strategies. Induc-
tively, overcrowding of strategies leads to the existence of
a period-Nc dynamics in the minority choice as well as the
attendance time series conditioned on an arbitrary but
ﬁxed history in MGmin(1)(Nc) [16, 17, 18, 19, 22, 23]. An-
other periodic dynamics coming from a slightly diﬀerent
origin is also present in MGmin(1)(Nc). Recall that the
history string gives complete information of the winning
choices in the past M turns in MGmin(1)(Nc) making its
minority choice time series highly correlated. By extend-
ing the analysis of Challet and Marsili in Ref. [16] from
Nc = 2 to a general prime power Nc, we conclude that
the minority choice time series from the (N M+1
k + 1)th
to the [N M+1
(k + 1)]th turn is likely to form a de Bruijn
sequence for all k ∈ N resulting in a period N M+1
peak
in the Fourier transform of both the minority choice and
the attendance time series [22]. Besides, it is likely that
between the above N M+1
turns, each strategy win ex-
actly N M
times. We follow the convention in Ref. [17]
c
by calling this correlation in the minority choice and at-
tendance time series the period-N M+1
dynamics. Note
c
that because of the period-N M+1
dynamics, the virtual
score diﬀerence between any two strategies is likely to be
k + 1)th turn for all k ∈ N. We call
zero in the (N M+1
this phenomenon virtual score reset [17].

choice. Thus, the publicly announced histories from the
(N M+1
(k + 1)]th turn no longer
c
tend to form a de Bruijn sequence and the virtual score
diﬀerence between two distinct strategies is unlikely to
reset [17, 22]. That is why the period-N M+1
dynamics
almost completely disappears as shown in Fig. 2. (Al-
though we only present the periodic dynamics and distri-
bution of history strings for the case of Nc = 5 in Figs. 2–
4, our simulations for other values of Nc are consistent
with our crowd-anticrowd explanation in this section.)
Nonetheless, from Fig. 3, we observe that the period-Nc
dynamics is slightly strengthened. To understand why,
let us recall that in MGmin(1)(Nc) and MGmaj (1)(2), the
virtual score reset mechanism implies that the (Nck+1)th
terms for all k ∈ N in the attendance time series condi-
tioned on an individual history is positively correlated.
This is the major contributor to the period-Nc dynam-
ics.
In contrast, for other MGsub(Nc) and for a ﬁxed
ℓ = 1, 2, . . . , Nc, the absence of a virtual score reset mech-
anism implies that correlations among the (Nck + ℓ)th
terms for all k ∈ N in the time series of attendance con-
ditioned on an individual history all pay about the same
contribution to the period-Nc dynamics, resulting in a
stronger correlation. However, the strength of this auto-
correlation conditioned on a particular history does not
give complete information on the degree of overcrowding.
It is the disappearance of period-N M+1
dynamics and
the absence of virtual score reset mechanism that make
a player more likely to stick to a strategy. Hence, play-
ers cooperate slightly better leading to a smaller mean
variance of attendance in other MGsub(Nc) [17].

c

Finally, we discuss the situation of α & αc, namely, the
asymmetric phase. In this phase, the number of strate-
gies at play N S is less than the maximal reduced strategy
space size N M+1
. Thus, the probability that a particular

alternative can never be picked by at least N/Nc players
increases as the number of players N decreases. By pi-
geonhole principle, for an alternative to be the majority
choice, the number of players choosing that alternative
must be at least N/Nc. Consequently, whenever α & αc,
some alternatives may never have a chance to be the ma-
jority choice. In contrast, there is no such type of con-
straint preventing an alternative from being a non-maj(1)
choice. Therefore, amongst all the history string gener-
ation methods we have studied, the “sub” = maj(1) one
will generate the most non-uniformly distributed history
strings. This assertion is conﬁrmed in Fig. 4, which plots
the frequency count of the history occurrence arranged
in descending order. As the non-uniformity of history
string leads to a reduction of the eﬀective strategy space
size, the crowd-anticrowd cancellation is strengthened in
the asymmetric phase [16]. Thus, the mean variance of
attendance obtained by using a majority history string
is consistently lower than those obtained by using other
history string generation methods.

DISCUSSIONS

We have investigated the role of diﬀerent real history
string generation method on the mean variance of atten-
dance per player Σ2/N and phase transition point αc in
a modiﬁcation of the Minority Game called MGsub(Nc).
We argued under the framework of crowd-anticrowd the-
ory that the general trend of the Σ2/N vs. α curve is
independent of the real history string generation method
although the dynamics of the system depends on the kind
of common history string used. Besides, we argue that
the phase transition point αc is independent of the his-

5

 

 

tory string generation method.
In fact, provided that
every strategy is deterministic and makes choice based
solely on the same public information, αc is a function of
Nc and S only. Although all numerical simulations re-
ported in the paper are performed by picking the strate-
gies from the full strategy space, we ﬁnd that the same
conclusions are reached if the strategies are taken from
the maximal reduced strategy space.

It is instructive to further extend our analysis to the
case that the rankings of all the Nc alternatives in each of
the previous M turns are used as public information. We
believe that both kinds of periodic dynamics (in this case,
one with period Nc and the other with period (Nc!)M+1)
should be present. However, a strategy can no longer be
regarded as a map from some ﬁnite ﬁeld to GF (Nc) for
Nc > 2. So, the maximal reduced strategy space size is
probably less than (Nc!)M+1 perhaps leading to a lesser
degree of player cooperation. Veriﬁcation of these hy-
pothesis by numerical simulation is, however, a very com-
putational intensive task as the maximal reduced strat-
egy space size is prohibitively large except for Nc . 4.

If the above conjecture is correct, then combined with
the studies of the dynamics of MG when played with
fake histories [16, 17, 24], we may say that the phase
transition point αc in the original MG is robust against
all reasonable history generation methods. Therefore, to
signiﬁcantly alter the phase transition behavior of MG,
one must change the rules of MG in other ways. One
possibility is to change to the virtual score computation
method such as the ones reported by Wong et al. [25, 26].

A parameterization that is a modiﬁed version of a previous work is proposed for the returns and
correlation matrix of ﬁnancial time series and its properties are studied. This parameterization
allows easy introduction of non-stationarity and it shows several of the characteristics of the true,
observed realizations, such as fat tails, volatility clustering, and a spectrum of eigenvalues of the
correlation matrix that can be understood as an extension of Random Matrix Theory results. The
predicted behavior of this parameterization for the eigenvalues is compared with the eigenvalues
of Brazilian assets and it is shown that those predictions ﬁt the data better than Random Matrix
Theory.

INTRODUCTION

The problem of determining the correct structure of
the correlation matrix is an important one in several dif-
ferent applications, and the methods of Random Matrix
Theory (RMT) [1, 2] have been successfully applied to
problems in many areas, such as magnetic resonance im-
ages [3], Meteorology [4], and ﬁnancial time series [5, 6].
The correct estimation of the correlations in Finance is
a fundamental step in portfolio choice [7]. The observa-
tion that most of the eigenvalues of the correlation matrix
can be due to noise, therefore, can have important con-
sequences and a model that provides that structure can
be a very useful tool in Finance as well as in other areas.
RMT does not claim to explain all the eigenvalue spec-
trum of ﬁnancial time series, since a few large eigenvalues
remain outside its scope. Also, a number of results have
been observed that are not in perfect agreement with
RMT, such as the observation that noise eigenvalues seem
to be a little larger than expected [8] and that correla-
tions can be measured in the supposedly random part of
the eigenvalue spectrum [9, 10]. It has also been veriﬁed
diﬀerent behaviors of the eigenvalues corresponding to
diﬀerent points of time, suggesting that non-stationary
eﬀects might play an important role [11, 12].

The role of non-stationarity on the eigenvalue spec-
trum of the correlation matrix was recently studied and
it has been found, by using a model where most eigen-
values are zero in the stationary region, that the non-
stationarity can be the cause for the several of the eigen-
values corresponding to the bulk region of the spec-
trum [13]. Here, that model will be altered, by introduc-
ing random components to the stationary regime. Such
an extension will provide a parameterization of the prob-
lem where several of the stylized facts about ﬁnancial
series will be observed. Simulations of the model will
show that the Mar˘cenko-Pastur (MP) distribution [14]
can be recovered as a limit case for the bulk eigenvalues
of the model when more random components are added.

The model also allows the introduction of non-bulk, large
eigenvalues in the correlation matrix and, therefore, it
can be seen as an extension of the results of Random
Matrix Theory.

II. THE MODEL

· · ·

In the original model

[13], the returns µi and the
, N and
correlation matrix Pil, where both i = 1,
, N refer to the assets, were obtained from a
l = 1,
M matrix Φ, that could be a function of the time t,
N
Φ(t). The matrix Φ components ϕij , where i = 1,
, N
represents the diﬀerent assets and where each value of j,
j = 1,
3, can be seen as a collection of M
vectors ϕ, each with N components. Each one of those
vectors represents a possible, typical state of the system.
Given Φ, the average return vector µ and the covariance
matrix Σ and the correlation matrix P will be given by

The observed returns rt, at instant t, are generated, as
usual, by a multivariate normal N (µ, Σ) likelihood.

In this article, a simple, but powerful extension of this
model is proposed. Instead of having a matrix Φ com-
posed of M
3 vectors, each consisting of parameters
to be estimated in order to adjust the model, Φ will be
composed of M + S
3 vectors. The ﬁrst M vectors
play the same role as before [13], while we have S new

pseudo-parameters, that are actually randomly drawn at
each instant of time (even though the S new vectors are
not real parameters of the model, since they will be gen-
erated randomly, they will be referred to, from now on,
as random parameters). With the introduction of the
random parameters, all sums in the Equation 1 are to be
performed now on from 1 to M + S. This introduces a
random element to the model that will cause the return
vector and correlation matrix to change in time, even in
the stationary case where each of the ϕij elements are
held constant (at least, for ﬁnite values of S).
In or-
der to preserve the variance associated with each return,
the random parameters will follow a normal distribution
N (0, Σii) for each asset i.

One nice feature of the original model is that, by mak-
ing each of the components ϕij follow a random walk,
this generates a non-stationary correlation matrix, with
all its properties automatically respected. A simple way
to model that is by choosing ϕij (t + 1) = ϕij (t) + σǫ.
However, for long periods of time, this causes the vari-
ance to explode. This is not a problem if one is interested
only in the correlation, but, here, the time behavior of
the returns will also be investigated. Therefore, a mean-
reversion term will be introduced to the random walk,
that is

ϕij (t + 1) = (1

a)ϕij (t) + σǫ,

where a is a small number that measures the strength
of the mean-reversal process (a = 0 corresponds to no
mean-reversal). The eﬀect of this term is negligible for
small periods of time as long as a is small enough[15].

III. RESULTS

Simulations were performed for the proposed model
in order to compare it to real data as well as with the
Mar˘cenko-Pastur distribution [14]. The real data corre-
sponds to the returns of N = 38 Brazilian stocks, ob-
served daily from January, 5th, 2004 to July, 28th, 2006,
for a total of T = 644 observations. Figure 1 shows the
behavior of the model for diﬀerent values of S as a distri-
bution obtained from the histogram of simulated results
when σǫ = 0.02 (the behavior for σǫ = 0.0 is visually
almost identical, with a slightly worse ﬁt, and, therefore,
it is not shown here). Notice that the Mar˘cenko-Pastur
distribution fails to describe the real data, since we are
in a ﬁnite case, away from the limits where it is expected
to be valid. On the other hand, the model here proposed
does a much better job, if S is chosen to be 2 or 3. For
the simulated results, the two largest eigenvalues are not
shown, since they are outside the bulk of random eigen-
values (15.1 and 6, for S = 2 and 11.9 and 6, for S = 3).
That means that the model not only describes better the
observed eigenvalues in the bulk region, but it also gen-
erates non-bulk eigenvalues (the real data has one large
eigenvalue of 16.2).

FIG. 1: Observed eigenvalues for N = 38 Brazilian assets,
compared with the simulated results for diﬀerent values of
s, in the non-stationary case (σǫ = 0.02) as well as the MP
distribution.

Another interesting feature that can be observed in
Figure 1 is that, as S gets larger, the predicted distribu-
tion seems to get closer to the MP distribution. This is
actually to be expected. If the M is kept constant, the
inﬂuence of the real vector parameters in the covariance
matrix becomes weaker as S grows. For large S, the prob-
lem tends to a simple sampling problem and the correla-
tion matrix is obtained from a basically random matrix,
therefore the agreement with RMT results. Since N = 38
is a small number of assets for a good visualization, sim-
ulations were run with N = 200, in order to observe the
convergence towards the MP distribution. Those results
can be observed in Figure 2.

For S = 0, the stationary case corresponding to the re-
sults shown in Figure 2, has only exactly zero eigenvalues,
that is, there is only one large peak in the distribution
at λ = 0. As S grows, the simulated distributions ap-
proaches reasonably fast the MP distribution as can be
seen from a reasonable approximation for S = 5 and an
almost exact match when S = 20. It is also interesting to
notice that, although the non-bulk eigenvalues still sur-
vive, they are smaller as S grows. This happens because
M was kept constant and, therefore, less important for
larger values of S.

This means that, while M is related to the large eigen-
values, S can be seen as a parameter that measures how
close to a random matrix the real data really is, as op-
posed to a simpler model where only the main eigenval-
ues exist. In that sense, this model provides an extension
of RMT results to cases where the randomization is not
complete. It also accounts for the largest observed eigen-
values and, therefore, provides a better ﬁt to real data
than RMT.

ues of s, in the stationary case (σǫ = 0.0) compared with the
MP distribution.

Another interesting feature of the simulated time se-
ries is the possibility of studying non-stationarity in the
covariance matrix and the returns. In order to observe
the long run behavior, Equation 2 was used to generate
a mean-reversing random walk in the parameters. Fig-

3

ure 3 show the results for a run with 216 time observa-
tions of N = 5 assets, with M = 2 and S = 1. The
non-stationarity parameters were chosen as a = 0.001
and σǫ = 0.02.

It is easy to see the volatility clustering in the time
series. Two eﬀects are actually responsible for that; the
random walk of the ϕij real parameters as well as a less
important, but existent eﬀect of the random parame-
ters. That happens because, if the S random parame-
ters are randomly drawn larger than expected once, this
will cause the variance at that point in time to increase,
making more likely to observe larger random parameters
in the next time period.

That is, we have seen that the introduction of random
parameters has allowed the proposed model to expand
the results of RMT. The resulting model presents a few
large eigenvalues (chosen by M ), a distribution for the
bulk eigenvalues that can be made to ﬁt the data better
than RMT and made to converge to RMT (by a proper
choice of S), if necessary, an easy way to introduce non-
stationary in returns and in the covariance matrix, and
it also shows volatility clustering. Finally, as noted in
the original model [13], even though normal distributions
were used throughout the article, all the observed time
series also show an increased kurtosis (except for σǫ = 0
and S = 0 or as S
). This eﬀect diminishes as
S grows, since that limit corresponds to a traditional
random matrix, but it is important for the smaller values
of S that seem to correspond to real problems.

[15] It is interesting to notice that the choices a and σǫ are
equivalent to a choice of an average variance for the ϕij .
This can be seen by calculating the variance of Equation 2
and equating the variances of ϕij for t and t + 1. That
point corresponds to the variance value around which the
variance of ϕij will oscillate.

Sociophysics Simulations IV: Hierarchies of Bonabeau et al

Institute for Theoretical Physics, Cologne University, D-50923 K¨oln, Euroland

Dietrich Stauﬀer

Abstract

The model of Bonabeau et al explains social hierarchies as random:
People keep a memory of recent ﬁghts, and winners have a higher
probability to win again. The question of phase transition and the
generalization from square lattices to networks is reviewed here.

1 Introduction

Why do some speakers at this 8th Granada Seminar give ﬁve lectures and
expect a million Euro honorarium, while others are allowed only to present a
poster and have to pay a registration fee. The elites of all times and regions
always had excellent reasons why they should be on top: They were kings by
the grace of god, or university professors by their excellent work. Indeed, at
the age when Albert Einstein wrote about relativity, diﬀusivity and quantum
photo eﬀect as a technical expert at the patent oﬃce in Bern, this author
was already paid as university assistant, a position never reached by Einstein.
Thats why this is this author’s fourth contribution to these proceedings.

However, bad people [1] ﬁnd also other reasons for my position. The
Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics for classical ideal gases gives air molecules a
probability exp(−v2/2mkBT ) to have a velocity vector v. If one air molecule
has a velocity ten times higher than average, then statistical physicists see
this as a normal though rare random event and do not associate any wonderful
properties with this molecule. And this is how [1] treats us: We got our
position in society by accident. These authors are evil because Bonabeau left
academia and Deneubourg gave a talk without a tie at a conference where
all male speakers were asked months in advance to wear a tie. Nevertheless
we now look at their model, following Rasputin’s advice that one can reject
sin only after having studied it.

2 Standard Model

(1)

(2)

People diﬀuse on a square lattice ﬁlled with density p. Whenever a person
wants to move onto a site already occupied by someone else, a ﬁght erupts
which is won by the invader with probability q and lost with probability
1 − q. If the invader wins, the winner moves into the contested site whereas
the loser moves into the site left free by the winner; otherwise nobody moves.
Each visitor adds +1 to a history parameter h, and each loss adds −1 to h.
At each iteration, the current h is diminished by ten percent, so that roughly
only the last ten time steps are kept in memory h. The probability q for
ﬁghter i to win against ﬁghter k is a Fermi function:

q = 1/[1 + exp((hk − hi)η)]

where the free parameter η could be unity. Initially everybody starts with
h = 0; then q = 1/2 for all ﬁghts. After some time, history h accumulates in
memory, q diﬀers from 1/2, and the standard deviation σ(t) with

σ2 =< q2 > − < q >2

measures the amount of inequalities in society at that time step t and is
obtained by averaging over all ﬁghts occuring during this iteration t.

This deﬁnes the model and the main quantity σ to look at. If instead
one looks at the history of one person and integrates its h over time, after
suﬃciently long times it averages to zero: Who is on top at some time may be
away from the top another time. Real Madrid has shown this to the football
world: There is always one team winning the Champions League, but it is
not necessarily the same team each year. We ﬁnd similar examples in the
political powers dominating Europe during the last two-thousand years.

Bonabeau et al [1] found a phase transition in that for high densities
the inequalities are strong, and for densities below some threshold they no
longer exist. This eﬀects corresponds to widespread feelings (see the movie
Dances with Wolves) that social hierarchies developed only with agriculture
and cities (but what about the Mongolian empire ?) Unfortunately that
eﬀect was based on an assumption which prevented equilibrium and let the
|h| go to inﬁnity. When corrected, the phase transition vanished [2]. The
transition was restored [3] by a feedback loop: the quantity η in eq.(1) was
replaced by the σ as calculated from eq.(2) at the previous time step. (For
the ﬁrst 10 time steps, σ was replaced by one.) Then a (ﬁrst-order) transition
was found again, Fig.1.

This program unfortunately violates the Gerling criterion that nobody
should publish more program lines than (s)he has years in life. Thus I start
with the core, after the comment line 41: If the site jnew to which agent
i wants to move is empty, latt(jnew) = 0, then the move is made: the
position of the agent is now jnew, and the occupation variables of the sites
j, jnew are interchanged.

Otherwise a ﬁght starts between agent i and the present inhabitant k.
The probability q from eq.(1) is calculated (with an escape if the argument

5

of the exponential function is too large) and taken into account in the av-
erages for σ, eq.(2). A random integer ibm, obtained by multiplication with
65539 (or better 16807 as earlier), is compared after normalization with the
probability q of the invader i to win; if i wins, again the occupation vari-
ables are interchanged, and so are the position variables ipos; moreover, the
history variables h are changes by ±1. If the invader loses, nobody moves,
and only the history variables are changed in the opposite sense. Then the
loop over all n agents ends, σ is evaluated and printed out. If σ < 10−6 or if
the maximum number maxstep of iterations is reached, the simulation ends.

4 Modiﬁcations

If this model [3] leads to hierarchies, then they are symmetric: There as
many people on top as they are on bottom. Reality is diﬀerent: There are
few leaders only. This asymmetry was partially reproduced by reducing the
history counter h by F points, with for example F = 2, in the case of a loss,
while a victory still increases h by only one point [4].

S´a Martins in that paper [4] also looked at scale-free networks of Barab´asi-
Albert type [5]. This aspect was studied more thoroughly by Gallos [6] and
Sousa [7]. It means we no longer ﬁght about territory against whoever sits on
the lattice site to which we want to move. Instead we ﬁght for power with our
acquaintances. And the social network of acquaintances may be described by
scale-free networks, where the number k of neighbours for each site follows a
probability distribution ∝ 1/k3 instead of having k = 4 on the square lattice.
Details of the simulations diﬀer, and so do their results [6, 4], but the sharp
phase transition was recovered. Gallos ﬁnds it at a very low concentration
< 0.1, which moreover may decrease towards zero for increasing network size.
A simpler network allows everybody to contact everybody, and also here
abrupt changes in the amount σ of hierarchies were seen [8]. Other cases
studied were Erd¨os-R´enyi random graphs, Watts-Strogatz small-world net-
works, and triads where friends of my friends are likely also my own friends
[7].

5 Summary

Even though the model was already published in 1995, it seems to become
fashionable only now with three independent papers in the ﬁrst few months
of 2005 [8, 6, 7]. Some crayﬁsh [9] followed Bonabeau et al earlier as we
physicists.

We thank A,.O. Sousa for a critical reading of the manuscript.

Abstract: We propose a discrete model for how opinion about a given phe-
nomenon, about which various groups of a population have diﬀerent degrees of
enthusiasm, such as fanaticism and extreme social and political positions, includ-
ing terrorism, may spread. The model, in a certain limit, is the discrete analogue
of a deterministic continuum model suggested by others. We carry out extensive
computer simulation of the model by utilizing it on lattices with inﬁnite- or short-
range interactions, and on (directed) Barab´asi-Albert scale-free networks. Several
interesting features of the model are demonstrated, and comparison is made with
the continuum model.

1 Introduction

Given the current political climate around the world, and the rise of extreme
ideologies everywhere, from the Middle East to Africa and Western Europe,
models that can provide insight into how such idealogies may spread in a
society are clearly of great interest. In particular, given that, (1) the phe-
nomenon of globalization has made interaction between people of various
nations around the globe much easier than two decades ago, and (2) the fact
that although extreme ideologies are usually advocated by very small fringe
groups, but yet they continue to survive, it is important to understand the
role of these two factors on the opinion about such antisocial behavior as
terrorism. The goal of the present paper is to suggest a model to study this
problem, and understand its implications.

Some simple models for terrorism or extreme opinions appeared years
ago in the physics [1] and sociological [2] literatures. The present work was
motivated by an article on bioterrorism [3], but the methods that we describe

1

and utilize can also apply to opinion dynamics regarding, for example, the
latest “Star Wars” movie, fashion, a political candidate running for oﬃce, or
other questions and opinions with varying degrees of enthusiasm. Thus, we
do not even try to deﬁne “terrorism” here, as the model that we consider is
generic.

The population in our model consists of four parts, G, S, E, and F corre-
sponding, respectively, to the general, susceptible, excited, and fanatic parts
of the population. For simplicity, hereafter we use the same letters to denote
the fractions of the total population belonging to each group. Members of the
population can be convinced by acquaintances from the S, E, and F groups
to move from the G group to S; from there by the E and F groups to change
to E, and from there by F to change to F . Moreover, members of each of the
three groups S, E, and F can change their status and go back directly to the
G group. The dynamics of a model based on such a partitioning of a popu-
lation has been treated in the continuum limit [3] by deterministic nonlinear
diﬀerential equations, depending only on the total fractions G, S, E, and F .
The continuum model can provide mathematically suﬃcient conditions for
terrorism, or any other opinion about a certain subject, to die out at long
times, implying that in the long-time limit everybody will belong to the G
group , while the fractions S, E, and F shrink to zero which, when it comes
to terrorism, is a good omen for the world.

However, as is well-known in the statistical physics of complex systems,
deterministic continuum models represent mean-ﬁeld approximations to the
actual problem which, although they allow for development of mathematical
proofs for the existence or nonexistence of certain phenomena and provide
us with a ﬁrst guide, they are also unreliable. Such models cannot take into
account the eﬀect of ﬂuctuations on the phenomena. In addition, such models
cannot take into account the eﬀect of the internet, fax machines, and satellite
television which have made long-range interactions between people on very
large scale possible. For example, in a phenomenon somewhat close to the
present problem, deterministic diﬀerential equations predicted [4] extinction,
whereas proper discrete simulations on a square lattice did not predict [4]
the same phenomenon.

Therefore, the goal of the present paper is to carry out extensive simu-
lation of a discrete model opinion dynamics which, in a certain continuum
limit, becomes similar to a deterministic model proposed by Ref.[3]. We uti-
lize Monte Carlo simulations of a population of individuals. Such simulations
may be called agent-based outside physics, but are used in physics since half

2

a century.

The plan of the paper is as follows. We ﬁrst describe the deterministic
continuum model which is based on a set of nonlinear diﬀerential equations.
We then describe the discrete model which is developed by putting individ-
uals on a two-dimensional lattice, but the individuals can still be inﬂuenced
by all other individuals. Then, we restrict the inﬂuence to nearest neigh-
bours. Finally, we replace the regular 2D lattice by a scale-free network of
Barab´asi-Albert type [6]. The main point of the paper is not testing whether
the model can provide quantitative predictions; rather, we deal only with the
methods and how to implement them realistically. In particular we follow
[3] in assuming that if S = E = F = 0 at some moment, then these three
quantities stay zero forever. Thus, one simulation corresponds to the opinion
dynamics following one external event and does not include new external
events to cause S, E, and F to become non-zero again.

2 The Deterministic Continuum Model

The fractions G, S, E, and F in the population of agents having the cor-
responding opinions, with C = S + E + F = 1 − G, change with time t
as:

(1a)

dS(t)/dt = β1CG − β2S(E + F )/C − γ1S
dE(t)/dt = β2S(E + F )/C − β3EF/C − γ2E
dF (t)/dt = β3EF/C − γ3E .
Without loss of generality we set β1 = 1 since, otherwise, it can be absorbed
in the time scale. We also set γ2 = γ1. Nevertheless, we still have not only the
four parameters β2, β3, γ1, and γ3, but also the three initial concentrations
E(0), S(0), and F (0), which are relevant due to the nonlinearity of the
continuum model. We use, in general, one million people and β2 = 0.5, β3 =
0.5, and γ3 = 0.20, starting with S = E = F = 0.2, which will be used
throughout the paper. Then, we check for changes in the behaviour when we
vary γ1.

(1c)

(1b)

Figure 1 illustrates the behaviour: As predicted in [3], for γ1 > β1 (= 1
here), only the general population remains; for decreasing γ1 ﬁrst, S also
survives, then does E. Finally, for γ1 = 0.25 F also survives, such that all
the four groups, G, S, E, and F remain present in the population.

3 Averaged Lattice

Now we put the agents onto a 1000 × 1000 square lattice, half of whom is
selected randomly to be ﬁxed as empty. The fractions G, S, E, and F now
refer to the ﬁlled half of the lattice, i.e., they are fractions of the population
and not of the lattice size and, thus, still add up to unity. We try to follow
closely the above set of equations, Eqs. (1), by the following rules for each
time step t → t + 1 (simultaneous updating of all agents):

G becomes S with probability β1C;
F becomes G with probability γ3;
E becomes G with probability γ2 and F with probability β3F/C, and
S becomes G with probability γ1 and E with probability β2(E + F )/C.

These changes are simulated by ﬁrst looking at the decay through γ and then
at the radicalisation through β. Therefore, it is possible that, e.g., an E ﬁrst
becomes G and immediately thereafter changes opinion to F .

Figure 2: Averages on lattice: Fractions of susceptible, excited and fanatic
agents (from top to bottom) at γ1 = 0.4: Fanatics die out. For γ1 = 0.2,
fanatics remain; for γ1 = 0.6, excited and fanatic agents die out, but even
for γ1 = 0.99, some susceptibles remain.

Again we set β1 = 1, γ2 = γ1. Figure 2 looks similar to Fig. 1 which is
not surprising since each agent is aﬀected by all other agents, which is the
limit that in statistical physics is described by a mean-ﬁeld approximation.
However, we always ﬁnd for probability γ1 < 1 some susceptible people,
which is in contrast to their extinction by continuum model. Only in the
unrealistic limit γ1 = 1 do they die out.

The reason for this persistence of susceptibles can be understood as fol-
lows: For large enough γ3, opinions E and F die out soon. Then, we have
the diﬀerential equation for S = 1 − G as a simpliﬁcation of Eq. (1a):

dS(t)/dt = β1(1 − S)S − γ1S ≃ (β1 − γ1)S

(2)

for small S, giving an exponential decay towards zero for γ1 > β1. For the
Monte Carlo approach, G becomes S with probability β1S and S becomes G

5

with probability γ1. Equilibrium thus requires, for small S and thus G near
unity, that:

γ1S = Gβ1S = β1(1 − S)S or 1 − S = γ1/β1

(3)

which gives S = 1 − γ1 for our choice β1 = 1. Only for γ1 > β1 would S
become zero, which is not possible if β1 = 1 since γ1 is a probability for the
Monte Carlo approach and no longer a rate which could also be larger than
one. Putting back β1 as a free parameter set equal to 0.5, everybody soon
returns to the general population, S = E = F = 0, for γ1 = 0.6.

Figure 3: Neighbour interactions on lattice: Fractions of susceptible, excited
and fanatic agents (from top to bottom) at γ1 = 0.4: excited and fanatic
agents die out together. Both groups also die out at γ1 = 0.9, while at
γ1 = 0.1 the fanatics die out soon whereas excited agents decay very slowly.

4 Nearest Neighbour Interactions

Now, we simulate a proper lattice population where only nearest neighbours
inﬂuence each other. Thus at each time step every agent selects randomly
one of the four nearest neighbours as a discussion partner and then follows
these rules (again C = E + S + F ):

G becomes S with probability β1, if neighbour is S, E, or F ;
F becomes G with probability γ3;
E becomes G with probability γ2, and

it becomes F with probability β3/C, if neighbour is F ;

S becomes G with probability γ1, and

it becomes E with probability β2/C, if neighbour is E or F .

Thus, no agent is convinced by an empty neighbour to change opinion.
Again we set β1 = 1, γ2 = γ1. Since the behaviour of the population now
depends on the single opinions and not only on their sum over all lattice sites,
ordered sequential updating with helical boundary conditions was used.

Figure 3 shows that, diﬀerently from Figs.1 and 2, both E and F , and

not only F , decay rapidly to zero; the susceptibles remain.

5 Networks

Human beings are not trees in an orchard, sitting on a square lattice and
having k = 4 neighbours each. The previous section used a half-empty
square lattice such that the number of neighbours varied between k = 0
and k = 4. In reality, some people have many friends and some only few.
Such social relationships are much better described by scale-free [6] networks
of Barab´asi-Albert type, where the number of people having k neighbours
decays as 1/k3 for not too small k. Moreover, real terrorism obeys a power
law [7].

To grow such a network we start with four people all connected with each
other and with themselves. Then, one after the other more sites are added,
and each new site selects four people of the existing network as neighbours
from whom to take advice. This selection is not random but proportional to
the current number k of neighbours of that person: Powerful people attract
more “friends“ than powerless people.

In this standard network, we then use directed opinion links. This means
each person takes advice only from those four people whom the person se-

lected when joining the network; the same person ignores the opinions of
those who joined later and selected this person as advisor. Directed networks
have been used before for, e.g., the Ising models [8] and opinion dynamics [9].
A computer program was listed in [10]. Again, ordered sequential updating
was used.

Figure 4 shows that in the present model everyone becomes normal: S =
E = F = 0 after suﬃciently long time, diﬀerently from the results obtained
with the square lattice of the previous section.
In contrast to the square
lattices for 50 × 50 up to 20, 000 × 20, 000, larger networks needed a slightly
longer time for E and F to decay; see Fig. 5. With diﬀerent parameters,
also quite complicated dynamics can be found; see Fig. 6.

If we use symmetric instead of directed connections in these networks, now
containing only 100,000 people, then for γ1 = 0.1 all four groups survive; for
γ1 = 0.4 the F die out; for γ1 = 0.6 also the E and for γ1 = 0.9 we end up
with S = E = F = 0 (not shown). Similar eﬀects are seen if, initially, the

ﬁrst four people are fanatic and all others have opinion G.

Thus, similarly to [10] for Ising magnets and diﬀerently from [9] for opin-
ion dynamics, the directed network structure gives very diﬀerent results com-
pared to the undirected case.

6 Conclusions

In summary, the model of [3] depends somewhat on the various changes in
the underlying connections which we had introduced. Overall we feel that we
conﬁrmed the main conclusions from diﬀerential equations [3]: Depending on
parameters like γ1, fanatics and/or excited agents survive or die out.

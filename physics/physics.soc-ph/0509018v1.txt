The understanding of language competition helps us to predict extinction and survival
of languages spoken by minorities. A simple agent–based model of a sexual population,
based on the Penna model, is built in order to ﬁnd out under which circumstances
one language dominates other ones. This model considers that only young people learn
foreign languages. The simulations show a ﬁrst order phase transition where the ratio
between the number of speakers of diﬀerent languages is the order parameter and the
mutation rate is the control one.

1. Introduction

Recently, increasing attention has been paid on the understanding of linguistic sys-
tems by computational and analytical methods. Physicists, mathematicians, com-
puter scientists and biologists apply their tools on the investigation of language
capability, language change and language competition1. Especially the similarity to
biological systems opens the ﬁeld of linguistics to methods of the far better under-
stood evolutionary systems. For an overview see refs.1,2,3.

It is believed that a concept of “Universal Grammar” is ﬁxed by some way in
our genetic code enabling humans to learn languages fast during our childhood4.
Much attention has been paid on the evolution of this trait and the competition
between diﬀerent grammars5,6. In these models the diﬀerent grammars compete by
giving higher ﬁtness to better competitors. Because of that it is possible to apply
directly models already successfully used in evolutionary biology.

The competition between languages has been investigated in the last years an-
alyzing the stability of an system of two or more languages3,7,8,9,10,11 as well as
their size distribution12,13. In our approach we use a computational model without

giving diﬀerent ﬁtness to agents with diﬀerent language traits and without neglect-
ing bilinguals. Models of that kind can be found in refs.3,10,11,12.

This makes our model diﬀerent from biological systems. The knowledge of a
diﬀerent language does not imply a higher death probability (we are aware that,
unfortunately, there are quite many exceptions of that rule). In order to present an
age–structured model we build our one on the Penna model14,15. By the treatment
of the genes like bits the model yields a rather realistic age–structure of a sexually
reproducing population, and is additionally suitable for large population sizes due
to its low computational cost. The usage of an age–structured model enables us to
merge an age–dependent learning procedure with a model of language competition
in order get more insight into their relation. We will focus on the question whether
a phase transition exists, as found in the models of refs.3,6, between the state of
dominance of one language and an uniform distribution (also called fragmentation).
The paper is organized as follows: the next section explains the model, the
following section presents the results of the model with respect to its parameter
space. The last section discusses the results and proposes further extensions of the
model.

2. The model

The model in this paper combines population genetics with age–dependent language
learning. The presentation of the genetical part, with the purpose to yield a stable
population having its characteristic age–structure, will be provided only shortly to
the reader. For a more detailed description of the Penna model and its applications
we refer to refs.14,15.

The sexual Penna model is a individual–based model where every agent is rep-
resented by its age and two strings (diploid) of 32 bits. The bit–strings are read in
parallel. Every iteration after birth a new position on each of the bit–strings be-
comes visible. A bit set to one corresponds to an harmful allele. At the beginning of
a simulation ﬁve positions are randomly chosen to be dominant ones. If the position
is dominant one bit of the two bit–strings suﬃces to make the position represent
a deleterious mutation. On the other positions both bits need to be set to one for
deleterious eﬀects. At the age at which an agent has its third deleterious mutation
it dies. In order to avoid population explosion an additional factor limits its growth:
the Verhulst factor 1 − N/K gives the probability of an agent to survive an itera-
tion. Here N is the current population size and K the so–called carrying capacity
deﬁning the maximum size of a population. After reaching the reproduction age
R = 10 a female agent every iteration chooses randomly a male with age equal or
older than R in order to produce one oﬀspring. For each parent its two bit–strings
are randomly crossed and recombined. Both parents contribute one string to the
oﬀspring. The oﬀspring suﬀers one deleterious mutation at a randomly chosen po-
sition on each of its both new strings. This high mutation rate lets the population

Fig. 1. The language string of the child is built by the two parent’s language strings. If both
parents speak a language, the child speaks it as well. If only one of the two parents speaks one, the
child speaks it with 50% probability. After composition of the child’s bit–string mutations with
probability m generate a new language spoken by the child on a randomly chosen position.

The language trait of an agent, that means its current ability to speak certain
languages, is modelled in a similar way as the genetic strings of biological ageing.

The whole structure, a language should consist of, is neglected, and language
is treated as an unit. Each agent contributes one additional bit–string of L bits
representing its capability to speak a maximum of L languages. So an agent who
has for instance its third bit set, speaks currently language l = 3 (eventually among
others). An agent can learn or forget a language only in youth during the ﬁrst c
iterations after birth. We call c the maximum learning age. Older agents are not
able to change their knowledge on languages. The interaction between a young agent
and a randomly chosen teaching agent works as follows: At ﬁrst a random position
on the language bit–string is chosen. The agent learns the language of that position
if it is spoken by the teacher. If the agent already speaks more than one language
it forgets the language of the chosen position if the teacher does not know it. In
the other cases no process of learning/forgetting is carried out. Let us illustrate the
outcome of the interaction in computational terms: the language trait of an agent
speaking zero or one language has an OR operation with the teacher’s one at the
chosen position, otherwise an AND operation. The young agents’s language traits
are actualized in this way by f diﬀerent teachers at diﬀerent positions per iteration.
f = 0.5 means that the language traits are actualized once per iteration with a
probability of 50%. At birth an oﬀspring obtains its language trait as illustrated

in Figure 1. If both parents speak the same language the oﬀspring will speak it as
well. In the case that only one of the parents speaks a language the child learns
it with a probability of 50%. Additionally, the child can know a new language at
birth with probability m (i.e. a randomly chosen bit position is set to one). We call
this probability m of erroneous learning the mutation rate in the following because
of its analogy to biological systems. The bit–string is initialized by chance at the
beginning of a simulation.

Fig. 2. Ratio of the two language sizes versus mutation rate. The size is the number of agents
speaking that language. The ﬁgure shows a clear phase transition. Diﬀerent population sizes alter
neither the shape nor the position of the critical point.

This section will concentrate at ﬁrst on the results of simulations with a trait of
two languages (L = 2). The simulations are carried out for at least 20, 000 iterations
or more for large population sizes. All results present the ﬁnal stationary state of a
simulation.

A phase transition can be observed for the ratio between the number of speakers
of diﬀerent languages. The ratio is averaged over the last 1, 000 time steps. Figure 2
shows the ratio versus the mutation rate, determining the control parameter, for
diﬀerent carrying capacities K. The simulations are carried out with a maximum
learning age of c = 4 and f = 0.5. Each point represents the outcome of a separate

simulation. The language ratio decreases fast at the critical point which is situated
between m = 0.2 and m = 0.3. The transition separates the phase/state of about
equal sizes for the two languages for small values of m from the phase/state where
one language dominates clearly the other one. We can observe in Figure 2 as well that
the population size does not alter the shape of the transition. Thus this transition
can be found for arbitrary population numbers and therefore corresponds to a real
physical phase transition.

The language ratio increases strongly for low mutation rates. A power law with
an exponent of minus one is exhibited in Figure 3. This exponent is the same for all
simulations presented here. The parameters in the simulations are c = 4, f = 0.5
and K = 1000000, i.e. the population consists of about 80, 000 agents.

In Figure 4 the shape of the phase transition is compared for diﬀerent values
of c and f , parameters deﬁning the amount of interaction between the agents. The
carrying capacity K = 100, 000 ﬁxes the population number at around 8, 000. The
shape of the transition remains the same but is shifted to higher values of the
mutation rate for increasing c and f . The shift is a linear one with respect to each
of both parameters. The shift decreases for values of c > 10 as expected due to the
smaller number of individuals surviving up to ages much older than the reproduction
age R = 10 (not shown). The phase transition disappears and the only ﬁnal state
of the model is the dominant one for very large values of f .

time during childhood. The shift increases linearly with an increasing maximum learning age c as
well as with increasing amount f of interaction per iteration.

3.2. Many languages

In the following the results of simulations with a language trait consisting of more
than two languages are compared to the previous ones. The language ratio R, the
measure for a possible domination of one over the others, is now deﬁned by

R =

N (lmax) · (L − 1)

,

L
P
l=1,l6=lmax

N (l)

(1)

where lmax is the most spoken language, L the number of languages, and N (l)
the number of agents speaking language l. The simulations are carried out with
c = 5 and K = 100, 000. We used f = 0.5, 1, 2, 4 for L = 2, 4, 8, 16, respectively in
order to keep the interaction per language constant. Figure 5a compares the shape
of the transition for diﬀerent numbers of languages. The position of the critical
point is shifted to smaller values of m for more languages. This means that the
more languages compete against each other, the lower is the possibility to have a
scenario where one language dominates the other ones. Figure 5b compares the same
simulations carried out with the initial state where all agents speak language l = 1.
The critical point is shifted to larger values of the mutation rate. This dependence
of the ﬁnal state on the initialization, leading to a hysteresis, shows that the phase
transition is of ﬁrst order. Here the jump from one phase into the other is located at
the intersection of the transition curve and the curve for the ratio of two languages.

Fig. 5. Ratio of languages versus mutation rate for diﬀerent numbers of L languages. The critical
point moves to smaller values of the mutation rate for increasing L. The phase transition is more
abrupt. a: For numbers of languages larger than two the curves collapse into one for values of m in
the left part where one language dominates the other ones. b: The initialization with one language
leads to a diﬀerent result. The transition shows a hysteresis for the simulations with more than
two languages increasing with L.

Finally, we present a histogram of the Hamming distances16 between all agents
for simulations with 16 languages for diﬀerent values of the mutation rate (Figure 6).
The parameters are the same as before. The Hamming distance is deﬁned by the
number of bits by which the two bit–strings diﬀer from each other. Or, in other
words, the number of bits which need to be changed to turn the language trait of

an agent into that of the other one. Figure 6 shows that the peak of the histogram
of Hamming distances turns from zero (dominance) to one (no dominance) at the
critical point (which here is located between m = 0.6 and m = 0.7).

4. Discussion and conclusions

In our model of language competition a phase transition similar to the one for
the competition of diﬀerent grammars in ref.6 and the one for the competition of
languages of ref.3 is observed. Nevertheless, working without ﬁtness improvement
for agents better adapted by their languages trait but with a sexual population
with random mating makes the simulations useful to characterize current language
competition. The phase of an uniform distribution of the languages (fragmenta-
tion) suggests a scenario where these languages compete equally against each other
maintaining a stable state of coexistence. In the other state one language dominates
clearly the other ones. The dependence of the phase transition point on the amount
of language interaction as well as on the number of competing languages lets us
make the following conclusions: There is no optimal value of maximum learning age
for a language. Its increase shifts the critical point to larger values of the mutation
rate. Thus a larger maximum learning age prevents the evolution of many languages
where contact among speakers of diﬀerent languages is strong. The model shows also
that a larger number of diﬀerent languages decreases the possibility of dominance

of one of them and makes the transition jump higher. Hence, the extinction of a
language in a multilingual system can lead to a transition to the state where one
language will begin to dominate all the other ones.

The phase transition analyzed in the presented model is of ﬁrst order for simula-
tions with many languages as found in the model of ref.3,6. The diﬀerences are that
in our case, the transition is completely independent of the population size. We do
not know if the simpliﬁcation of a language to a single bit leads to this discrepancy
or if it is the usage of a model with sexual reproduction. Further analysis has to be
done.

The model brought insight into the mechanisms of language competition but still
much has to be done. The results are similar to the ones of ref.3. Nevertheless, our
model presents another approach to understand language competition. The design
of an analytical model, for instance by diﬀusion equations similar to the ones used
in ref.8, without ﬁtness would reveal if it is possible to obtain similar results with
a mean ﬁeld theory. The model presented in this paper can be extended by putting
it on a lattice in order to investigate how the transition behaves with respect to a
geographic distribution of languages. Another extension would be the substitution
of random mating by assortative mating9, a concept used frequently in the theory
of biological speciation, in order to give diﬀerent priorities to monolingual parents
and bilingual ones. In order to understand language invasion, the model can be
extended to include social structures.

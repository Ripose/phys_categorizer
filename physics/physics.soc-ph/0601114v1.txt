Abstrat

Soial networks are organized into ommunities with dense internal onnetions,

giving rise to high values of the lustering oe(cid:30)ient. In addition, these networks

have been observed to be assortative, i.e. highly onneted verties tend to onnet

to other highly onneted verties, and have steep degree distributions. We present

a model for an undireted growing network whih reprodues these harateristis,

with the aim of produing e(cid:30)iently very large networks to be used as platforms

for studying soiodynami phenomena. The ommunities arise from a mixture of

random attahment and impliit preferential attahment. The strutural properties

of the model are studied analytially and numerially, using the k-lique method for

quantifying the ommunities.

Introdution

The reent substantial interest in the strutural and funtional properties of

omplex networks (for reviews, see [1, 2, 3℄) has been partially stimulated

by attempts to understand the harateristis of soial networks, suh as the

small-world property and high degree of lustering [4℄. Before this, soial net-

works have been intensively studied by soial sientists [5, 6, 7℄ for several

deades in order to understand both loal phenomena, suh as lique formation

and their dynamis, as well as network-wide proesses, suh as transmission

of information. Within the framework of omplex networks, studies have on-

entrated on the strutural analysis of various types of soial networks, suh

and Internet dating [11℄, as well as models of olletive behaviour and various

soiodynami phenomena [12, 13, 14℄. One feature of partiular interest has

been to evaluate and detet ommunity struture in networks [15, 16, 17, 18℄,

where the developed methodologies have found appliations in various other

(cid:28)elds suh as systems biology [19℄. Communities an, roughly speaking, be

de(cid:28)ned as sets of verties with dense internal onnetions, suh that the inter-

ommunity onnetions are relatively sparse. In everyday soial life or pro-

fessional ollaborations, people tend to form ommunities, the existene of

whih is a prominent harateristi of soial networks and has far reahing

onsequenes on the proesses taking plae on them, suh as propagation of

information and opinion formation.

It is evident that theoretial studies of proesses and olletive behaviour tak-

ing plae on soial networks would bene(cid:28)t from realisti soial network models.

Essential harateristis for soial networks are believed to inlude assortative

mixing [20, 21℄, high lustering, steep degree distributions [22, 23℄, and the ex-

istene of ommunity struture. Here, we propose a new model that exhibits

all the above harateristis. So far, di(cid:27)erent approahes have been taken to

de(cid:28)ne soial network models [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30℄. To our knowledge,

of the above [23℄ exhibits ommunity struture, high lustering and assortativ-

, but based on visualizations given in the paper their ommunity struture

appears di(cid:27)erent from the proposed model. Our model belongs to the lass of

growing network models, i.e. all edges are generated in onnetion with new

verties joining the network. Network growth is governed by two proesses:

1) attahment to random verties, and 2) attahment to the neighbourhood

of the random verties ("getting to know friends of friends"), giving rise to

impliit preferential attahment. These proesses then give rise to broad de-

gree distributions, high lustering oe(cid:30)ients, strong positive degree-degree

orrelations and ommunity struture.

This paper is strutured as follows: First, we motivate the model based on real-

world observations, followed by desription of the network growth algorithm.

Next, we derive approximate expressions for the degree distribution and lus-

tering spetrum and ompare our theoretial results to simulations. We also

present numerial results for the degree-degree orrelations. We then address

the issue of ommunity struture using the k-lique method [18℄. Finally, we

onlude with a brief summary of our results.

2 Model

2.1 Motivation for the model

Our basi aim has been to develop a model whih a) is simple enough to allow

analytial derivations of the fundamental harateristis, and b) aptures the

salient features of real-world soial networks. To satisfy the (cid:28)rst riterion, we

have hosen a growing network model, sine this allows using the rate equation

approah [31, 32℄, and beause even very large networks an be produed using

a simple and quik algorithm. It has been onviningly argued [25℄ that sine

the number of verties in a soial network hanges at a very slow rate ompared

to edges, a realisti soial network model should feature a (cid:28)xed number of

verties with a varying number and on(cid:28)guration of edges. However, as our

fous is to merely provide a model generating substrate networks for future

studies of soiodynami phenomena, the time sales of whih an be viewed

to be muh shorter than the time sales of hanges in the network struture,

a model where the networks are grown to desired size and then onsidered

stati is suitable for our purposes.

To satisfy the seond riterion, we have set the following requirements for the

main harateristis of networks generated by our model: i) Due to limited

soial resoures, the degree distribution p(k) should have a steep tail [22℄,

ii) The networks should exhibit high average lustering, iii) The networks

should display positive degree-degree orrelations, i.e. be assortative, iv) The

networks should ontain ommunities with dense internal onnetions.

Requirement i) is based on the observation that many soial interation net-

works display power-law-like degree distributions but may display a uto(cid:27) at

large degrees [9, 10℄, or hange to power-law behaviour with a higher expo-

nent [23℄. In the ase of everyday soial networks, ommon sense tells us that

even in very large soial networks, no person an have tens of thousands of

aquaintanes. Hene, if the degree distribution is to be asymptotially sale-

free p(k) ∝ k−γ
, the value of the exponent γ should be above the ommonly
observed range of 2 < γ ≤ 3 suh that in networks of realisti sizes, N ≥ 106

verties, the maximum degree is limited

. As detailed later, suh

2

, kmax ∼ 102

power-law distributions an be attributed to growth proesses mixing random

and preferential attahment.

Requirements ii) high lustering, iii) assortativity, and iv) existene of ommu-

nities are also based on existing observations, and an be attributed to "loal"

edge formation, i.e. edges formed between verties within short distanes. The

degree of lustering is typially measured using the average lustering oe(cid:30)-

2

For networks with a sale-free tail of the degree distribution, kmax ∼ N 1/(γ−1)

ient hci, de(cid:28)ned as the network average of c(k) = 2E/k (k − 1), where E is
1
2 k (k − 1)
the number of triangles around a vertex of degree k and the fator

gives the maximum number of suh triangles. A ommonly utilized measure of

degree-degree orrelations is the average nearest-neighbour degree spetrum

knn(k) - if knn(k) has a positive slope, high-degree verties tend to be on-

neted to other high-degree verties, i.e. the vertex degrees in the network

are assortatively mixed (see, e.g., Ref. [33℄). For deteting and haraterizing

ommunities, several methods have been proposed [15, 16, 17, 18, 19℄. In soial

networks, eah individual an be assigned to several ommunities, and thus

we have hosen to investigate the ommunity struture of our model networks

using a method whih allows membership in several ommunities [18℄.

2.2 Model algorithm

The algorithm onsists of two growth proesses: 1) random attahment, and

2) impliit preferential attahment resulting from following edges from the ran-

domly hosen initial ontats. The loal nature of the seond proess gives rise

to high lustering, assortativity and ommunity struture. As will be shown

below, the degree distribution is determined by the number of edges gener-

ated by the seond proess for eah random attahment. The algorithm of the

model reads as follows

:

3

(1) Start with a seed network of N0 verties.
(2) Pik on average mr ≥ 1 random verties as initial ontats.
(3) Pik on average ms ≥ 0 neighbours of eah initial ontat as seondary

ontats.

(4) Connet the new vertex to the initial and seondary ontats.

(5) Repeat steps 2 to 4 until the network has grown to desired size.

The analytial alulations detailed in the next setion use the expetation

values for mr and ms . For the implementation, any non-negative distributions
of mr and ms an be hosen with these expetation values. If the distribution

for the number of seondary ontats has a long tail, it will often happen that

the number of attempted seondary ontats is higher than the degree of the

initial ontat so that all attempted ontats annot take plae, whih will bias

the degree distribution towards smaller degrees. We all this the saturation

e(cid:27)et, sine it is aused by all the neighbours of an initial ontat being used

3

Our network growth mehanism bears some similarity to the Holme-Kim model,

designed to produe sale-free networks with high lustering [34℄. In the HK model,

the networks are grown with two proesses: preferential attahment and triangle

formation by onnetions to the neighbourhood. However, the strutural properties

of networks generated by our model di(cid:27)er onsiderably from HK model networks

(e.g. in terms of assortativity and ommunity struture).

up, or saturated. However, for the distributions of ms used in this paper the

saturation e(cid:27)et does not seem to have muh e(cid:27)et on the degree distribution.

Here, we use the disrete uniform distributions U[0, k], k = 1, 2, 3 for the
number of seondary ontats n2nd , while for the number of initial ontats
ninit we usually (cid:28)x the probabilities to be p1 = 0.95 for piking one ontat
and p2 = 0.05 for piking two. This results in sparse onnetivity between the

ommunities.

2.3 Vertex degree distribution

An approximative expression for the vertex degree distribution an be de-

rived by the mean-(cid:28)eld rate equation method [31℄. We (cid:28)rst onstrut the rate

equation whih desribes how the degree of a vertex hanges on average dur-

ing one time step of the network growth proess. The degree of a vertex vi
grows via two proesses: 1) a new vertex diretly links to vi (the probability
of this happening is mr/t, sine there are altogether ∼ t verties at time t,
and mr random initial ontats are piked) 2) vertex vi is seleted as a se-

ondary ontat. In the following derivations we assume that the probability of

2) is linear with respet to vertex degree, i.e. following a random edge from a

randomly seleted vertex gives rise to impliit preferential attahment. Note

that in this approximation we neglet the e(cid:27)ets of orrelations between the

degrees of neighbouring verties. On average ms neighbours of the mr initial

ontats are seleted to be seondary ontats. These two proesses lead to

the following rate equation for the degree of vertex vi :

∂ki
∂t

= mr(cid:18)

+ ms

1
t

=

mr +

1
t (cid:18)

ms
2(1 + ms)

,
ki(cid:19)

ki

P

k (cid:19)

k , based on the fats that the average
where we substituted 2mr(1+ms) t for
initial degree of a vertex is kinit = mr(1 + ms), and that the ontribution of
P

the seed to the network size an be ignored. Separating and integrating (from

ti to t, and from kinit to ki ), we get the following time evolution for the vertex

degrees:

(1)

(2)

ki(t) = B

1/A

t
ti (cid:19)

(cid:18)

− C,

where A = 2 (1 + ms) /ms , B = mr (A + 1 + ms), and C = Amr .

From the time evolution of vertex degree ki(t) we an alulate the degree dis-
tribution p(k) by forming the umulative distribution F (k) and di(cid:27)erentiating
with respet to k . Sine in the mean (cid:28)eld approximation the degree ki(t) of a
vertex vi inreases stritly monotonously from the time ti the vertex is initially
added to the network, the fration of verties whose degree is less than ki(t)
at time t is equivalent to the fration of verties that were introdued after
time ti . Sine t is evenly distributed, this fration is (t − ti)/t. These fats lead

to the umulative distribution

F (ki) = P ( ˜k ≤ ki ) = P ( ˜t ≥ ti ) =

( t − ti ).

(3)

1
t

Solving for ti = ti(ki, t) = BA (ki + C)−A t from (2) and inserting it into (3),
di(cid:27)erentiating F (ki) with respet to ki , and replaing the notation ki by k

6

in the resulting equation, we get the probability density distribution for the

degree k as:

p(k) = ABA(k + C)−2/ms− 3,
where A, B and C are as above. Hene, in the limit of large k , the distribution
beomes a power law p(k) ∝ k−γ
, with 3 ≤ γ < ∞, whih is in aordane

(4)

with formulas derived for generalized linear preferential attahment [36, 37℄.

This is beause mixing random and preferential attahment an be reast

as preferential attahment with a shifted kernel suh that the probability of

onneting to a vertex is πk ∝ k + k0 , where k0 is a onstant. Now, when
2/ms → 0, the degree exponent γ → 3, thus reovering the value resulting

from pure preferential attahment.

2.4 Clustering spetrum

The dependene of the lustering oe(cid:30)ient on vertex degree an also be found

by the rate equation method [32℄. Let us examine how the number of triangles

Ei around a vertex vi hanges with time. The triangles around vi are mainly
generated by two proesses: 1) Vertex vi is hosen as one of the initial ontats
with probability mr/t, and the new vertex links to some of its neighbours (we
assume ms on average, although sometimes this is limited by the number of
neighbours the initial ontat has, i.e. saturation) 2) The vertex vi is seleted

as a seondary ontat, and a triangle is formed between the new vertex,

the initial ontat and the seondary ontat. Note that triangles an also be

generated by seleting two neighbouring verties as the initial ontats, but

in the (cid:28)rst approximation the ontribution of this is negligible. These two

proesses are desribed by the rate equation

∂Ei(ki, t)
∂t

=

mrms
t

+ mrms

=

∂ki
∂t

+

mr(ms−1)
t

,

(5)

ki
k

P

where the seond right hand side is obtained by applying Eq. (1). Integrating

both sides with respet to t, and using the initial ondition Ei(kinit, ti) = mr(1 + ms),
we get the time evolution of triangles around a vertex vi as

Ei(t) = ki(t) + mr(ms − 1) ln

− mr.

(6)

t
ti (cid:19)

(cid:18)

We an now make use the previously found dependene of ki on ti for (cid:28)nding
in terms of ki from (2), inserting it into (6) to get
ci(k). Solving for ln
Ei(ki), and dividing Ei(ki) by the maximum possible number of triangles,
ki(ki − 1)/2, we arrive at the lustering oe(cid:30)ient:

t
ti (cid:17)

(cid:16)

7

ci(ki) =

2Ei(ki)
ki(ki − 1)

= 2

ki + D ln(ki + C) − F
ki(ki − 1)

,

where C = Amr , D = C(ms − 1), and F = D ln B + mr . For large values of
degree k , the lustering oe(cid:30)ient thus depends on k as c(k) ∼ 1/k .

2.5 Comparison of theory and simulations

Fig. 3 displays the degree distributions averaged over 100 runs for networks

of size N = 106

for various parametrizations, together with analytial urves

alulated using Eq. (4). The derived degree distribution oinides reasonably

with simulated results. Theoretially, the tails of the distributions should fol-

low a power law p(k) ∝ k−γ
with exponents (from top to bottom) γ = 5, 4.33,
5, and 7. However, at high degrees, the simulated distributions learly fall be-

low the analytial preditions. This deviation an be attributed to the presene

of degree orrelations in the simulated networks, whih were negleted in the

derivation of the formulas. This an be shown by replaing the attahment to

seondary ontats by pure random preferential attahment, after whih the

8

simulated and theoretial slopes math very losely. Hene, the assumption

that seleting the nearest neighbours of randomly hosen verties orresponds

to exat preferential attahment is stritly speaking not true; a similar e(cid:27)et

has been observed earlier in onnetion with a random walk network growth

model [38℄. However, the formulas still orretly predit the overall behaviour

of the degree distribution suh that the lower the value of ms , the steeper the

tail of the distribution.

The left panel of Fig. 4 displays averaged values of the lustering oe(cid:30)ient

c(k) for the same networks, together with analytial urves alulated using

Eq. (7). We see that the preditions math the simulated results well, and

the c(k) ∼ 1/k-trend is learly visible. The orresponding network-averaged
lustering oe(cid:30)ients are (top to down) hci = 0.30, 0.58, 0.54 and 0.43, i.e.

the degree of lustering is relatively high.

2.6 Degree orrelations

Next, we investigate the degree orrelations of our model networks. Soial

networks are often assoiated with assortative mixing [20℄ related to vertex

degrees, i.e. high-degree verties tend to onnet to other high-degree verties.

This tendeny an be formulated in terms of a onditional probability P (k′|k)
that an edge onneted to a vertex of degree k has a vertex of degree k′

at

its other end [33℄. A quantity more suitable for numerial investigations is

k′ k′P (k′|k). If knn(k) is an
the average nearest-neighbour degree knn(k) =
inreasing funtion of k , the network is assortatively mixed in terms of vertex
degrees. The right panel in Fig. 4 shows knn(k) averaged over 100 networks,

P

displaying a lear signature of assortative mixing.

Qualitatively, the presene of positive degree-degree orrelations an be at-

tributed to the neighbourhood onnetions, as well as the high degree of lus-

tering. Consider a situation where a new vertex attahes to one initial ontat

vi and ms of its neighbours, so that the degree of all the verties in question

is inreased by one. Hene, positive degree orrelations are indued between

vi and its ms neighbours. In addition, beause of the high lustering, there is
a large probability of onnetions between the ms neighbours. This gives rise
to positive degree orrelations between the ms verties.

2.7 Community struture

The emergene of ommunities in the networks generated by our model an

be attributed to the e(cid:27)ets of the two types of attahment. Roughly speaking,

attahment to the seondary ontats tends to enlarge existing ommunities;

the new vertex reates triangles with the initial ontat and its nearest neigh-

bours. If the internal onnetions within an existing ommunity are dense, the

seondary ontats tend to be members of the same ommunity, and thus this

ommunity grows. On the other hand, new verties joining the network may

attah to several initial ontats (with our parametrizations, two or three).

If they belong to di(cid:27)erent ommunities, the new vertex assumes the role of

a "bridge" between these. However, no edges are added between the verties

already in the network. Therefore, the maximum size of a lique, i.e. a fully

onneted subgraph, to be found in the network is limited by the maximum

number of edges added per time step. In this model the number of added edges

varies, allowing for fairly large liques to form while average vertex degree is

kept small. Visualizations of our model networks with proper parametrization

exhibit lear evidene of ommunity struture, as shown in Fig. 2.

Fig. 5. The average number of k-lique-ommunities ( •: k = 3, ⋄: k = 4, ∗: k = 5) of
eah size found in our model network with N = 50 000, number of initial onnetions
p(ninit = 1) = 0.95, p(ninit = 2) = 0.05, and number of seondary onnetions
from U [0, 3], averaged over 20 networks. Community sizes seem to follow power law
behaviour p(s) = s−δ
, with estimated exponents k = 3: δ = 2.8 ± 0.2 (outliers ex-
luded), k = 4: δ = 3.9 ± 0.3, and k = 5: δ = 10 ± 2. A very large 3-lique-ommunity

spans roughly half of the verties in any network generated with these parame-

ters. In randomized networks, there were only a few adjaent triangles, and no

(cid:3)

: 3-lique-ommunities found in the randomized networks). The
4-liques at all (
inset shows the e(cid:27)et of network size N on the 3-lique-ommunity size distribution
for N = 100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10000, 50000. As all data (cid:28)t on the same line when
saled by 1/N , the network size does not a(cid:27)et the slope. The outliers depit the

superommunities.

In order to quantify the ommunity struture, we have utilized the k-lique

method of Palla et al. [18, 39℄ and the free software pakage CFinder they

provide. In this approah, the de(cid:28)nition of ommunities is based on the obser-

vation that a typial ommunity onsists of several fully onneted subgraphs

(liques) that tend to share many of their verties. Thus, a k-lique-ommunity
is de(cid:28)ned as a union of all k-liques that an be reahed from eah other
through a series of adjaent k-liques (where adjaeny means sharing k − 1

verties). This de(cid:28)nition determines the ommunities uniquely, and one of its

strengths is that it allows the ommunities to overlap, i.e. a single vertex an

be a member of several ommunities. For soial networks, this is espeially

justi(cid:28)ed.

Fig. 6. Distributions of ommunity degrees d for ommunities de(cid:28)ned using 3-,4-
and 5-liques, averaged over 20 networks of size N = 50 000 with the same param-
eters as in Fig. 5. The tails of the distributions appear power-law-like, p(d) = d−α
Approximate slopes are plotted as guides to the eye: k = 3: α = 4.2, k = 4: α = 3.5,
and k = 5: α = 5.0.

.

We have found that the size distribution of k-lique-ommunities in our model
networks seems to follow a power law behaviour p(s) = s−δ
nents were seen not to depend on the network size N . In the ase of 3-liques,

(Fig. 5). The expo-

a very large ommunity spans roughly half of the verties in any network

generated with these parameters. No suh superommunities arise with k > 3.

Similar large 3-liques an be observed in many other networks with ommuni-

ties as well, e.g. in the datasets provided with the CFinder pakage: a snapshot

of the o-authorship network of the Los Alamos e-print arhives, where 16 407
of the 30 561 verties (i.e. 54%) belong to the largest 3-lique-ommunity, in

the word assoiation network of the South Florida Free Assoiation norms,

where the orresponding fration is 67%, and in the protein-protein intera-
tion network of the Saharomyes erevisiae (17%). The requirements for a
3-lique-ommunity are not very strit, and it is not surprising that one om-

munity an span most of the network. To ompare the resulting ommunity

size distributions with randomized networks, we srambled the edges of the

networks keeping the degree distributions intat (Fig. 5).

Finally, we have investigated the way in whih the ommunities themselves are

onneted with one another. The question, whether the strutural properties

of the (cid:16)oarse-grained(cid:17) network with nodes representing the ommunities are

12

similar or dissimilar to the original network, is of interest. These properties

an also be expeted to a(cid:27)et the dynamis of various proesses suh as infor-

mation (cid:29)ow and opinion formation. For the network of ommunities de(cid:28)ned

using the k-lique method, the degree d of a ommunity has been de(cid:28)ned as

the number of other ommunities with whih the ommunity has an overlap,

i.e. with whih it shares verties [18℄. Fig. 6 displays ommunity degree distri-

butions p(d) obtained from simulations with the same parameters as used for

the networks of Fig. 5. The existene of very large 3-liques is re(cid:29)eted in the

respetive ommunity degree distribution in the form of nodes of very large

degree. Otherwise, the ommunity degree distributions are seen to be broad

like the degree distributions of the original networks, and appear to approah

power-law like tails as d is inreased. Note that the ommunity degree distri-

butions of several real world networks have been found to start exponentially

and hange abruptly to power laws in the end [18℄. However, no suh abrupt

hange is present here.

3 Summary

In this paper we have developed a model whih produes very e(cid:30)iently net-

works resembling real soial networks in that they have assortative degree

orrelations, high lustering, steep degree distributions and prominent om-

munity struture. The model is based on network growth by two proesses:

attahment to random verties and attahment to their neighbourhood. The-

oretial approximations for the degree distribution and lustering spetrum (cid:28)t

simulated results reasonably well. Visualizations of the network and quantita-

tive analysis show signi(cid:28)ant ommunity struture. In terms of ommunities

de(cid:28)ned using the k-lique method, the analyzed ommunity size and degree
distributions display power-law-like tails; in the ase of 3-liques, there is also

a large ommunity spanning roughly half of the network. These types of fea-

tures are also present in many real-life networks, making the model well suited

for simulating dynami phenomena on soial networks.

Abstract

This paper examines the emerging phenomenon of blogging, using
three diﬀerent Polish blogging services as the base of the research. Authors
show that blog networks are sharing their characteristics with complex
networks (γ coeﬃcients, small worlds, cliques, etc.). Elements of socio-
metric analysis were used to prove existence of some social structures in
the blog networks.

1 Introduction

1.1 Blog – what is it?
Blog 1 2 is a diary published on the author’s website. Because the Internet is used
as a medium, authors feel free to express their opinions and views on diﬀerent
subjects, without fear of censorship.

1.2 How blog networks are created?

As blogging becomes very popular, many internet portals oﬀer (mostly free of
charge) blogging facilities to their customers. That causes aggregation of blogs
in one “place”, and encourages building communities. Bloggers (as we call
people who run their blogs) very often place hypertext links to their friends and
colleagues sharing similar views or describing similar subjects. Such connections
create what we call blog networks which are subject of our research.

1.3 Examined blogging services

We examined three diﬀerent Polish blogging services:

1. blog.onet.pl – one of the most popular services, about 150, 000 registered

2. blog.gery.pl – moderately known service, about 15, 000 blogs

3. jogger.pl – niche service, gathering mostly tech-savvy people, only around

blogs

1, 500 blogs

It should noted that many of blogs may be abandoned by their authors and
no longer updated. They are still available however, and were taken into the
account.

2 Collecting the data

We used standard GNU/Linux tools to automate process of collecting the data:

• text-mode lynx browser for downloading the content of WWW pages

• grep for ﬁltering out unnecessary information

• sort for sorting the blog list

• uniq for removing the duplicate blog list entries

• bash shell which provided a scripting framework

Usually blogging services provide users with possibility of listing all existing
blogs. We used this feature to create a list of all bloggers for each service. For
example jogger.pl blog list has the following URL:

http://jogger.pl/users.php?sort=1&start=offset

where offset is the CGI parameter for specifying position in the list. It has
100 blog links presented on each page, so it was possible to gather all the blog
links by starting from offset=0 and increasing it by 100 in a loop until no
more blogs were presented. In each loop iteration content of the list page was
downloaded by using lynx browser in HTML source dump mode. Then grep
was used to ﬁlter out all data apart from blog URL addresses. We found it
convenient to sort the resulting list and remove duplicate entries.

When the list was ready, content of every listed blog page was downloaded
and links to other blogs in the same service were ﬁltered out in similar manner.
In the result, list of all outgoing connections for each blogger in the service was
created. This process was repeated for each examined blogging service.

3 Quantitive analysis

This section presents results of quantitive analysis performed on data collected
from the services we examined.

3.1 Vertices

The terminology we used comes from the graph theory. Each blog is represented
by a vertex in the connection graph.

Average vertex degrees for each service:

1. blog.onet.pl: 0.8105

2. blog.gery.pl: 0.5243

3. jogger.pl: 0.4392

It’s clearly seen that these graphs are very sparse. We’ll try to show that the
function of degree distribution is of power–law type: Count(k) ∝ k−γ, where k
represents vertex degree.

Histograms presented in Figures 1, 2 and 3 are very similar, even though
number of blogs in each service is diﬀerent by an order of magnitude. That
shows us that scaling is also very similar in these networks.

γ coeﬃcients of the vertices degree functions are presented in Table 1 below.

3.3 Cliques

Two diﬀerent kinds of connections between the vertices are distinguished – weak
(idols and fans) and strong (friends). We call a connection between vertices
A, B weak when there’s only one edge, going either from A to B or B to A.
That means that only one blog links to the other, which resembles relationship
between fan and his idol. On the other hand, connection is called strong when
two edges between A and B can be found. First goes from A to B and the other
from B to A. If we assume that linking to somebody’s blog means liking that
person, then such relation means that A and B are friends as they like each
other.

We also measured average cliquity for each service. Cliquity ci represents
“completeness” of the neighbourhood of vertex i [8, 9], i.e. ci is 1 in case of a
complete subgraph, 0 when a vertex is isolated.

Average cliquities for each service are presented in Table 4. Figures 5–7 and
8–10 show histograms of vertex cliquities for each examined service, weak and
strong connections respectively. Overdominance of isolated vertices is evident.
When strong connections are considered, full subgraphs can be observed in
larger services.

4 Sociometric analysis

Connected graph is a graph in which every two vertices are connected with a
path. Two subgraph groups have been generated: strong relationship graphs
— when one blog is referring to another, the other mutually referring to the

Frequencies of vertex degrees depending on the type of relationship are shown
in Fig. 11. The number of isolated persons was established (no references to
other blogs on their pages). The result is given in Table 5. Having given number
of isolated persons from particular blog service, it is possible to establish group
integration index. The integration index is calculated with the following method

These are respectively: IGgery = 7.8715 ∗ 10−5, IGonet = 9.5524 ∗ 10−6.
As a result of computer - aided calculations we have been able to determine
the number of blog pairs for blog.onet.pl and blog.gery.pl services where authors
chose each other mutually (placed links in their weblogs). For blog.gery.pl this
was 554 of total 14861; in case of blog.onet.pl this value reached 21160 of total
number of 141755 weblogs. Connection index is given by formula [3]:

SG =

Idol

Consequently, connection indices for these blogs are respectively: SGgery =
5.0173 ∗ 10−6, SGonet = 2.106 ∗ 10−6. Notice that despite a tenfold population
diﬀerence between the two services, connection indices diﬀer only about 2 times.
is a sociometric structure which describes person who got the large
number of positive choices, though making small number of choices by itself
(that means that it has small positive expansion)[1, 4, 7] . With idol is connected
the person of eminence grise — who is the person chosen by idol (illustrated in
Fig. 12).

Blog jpc (shown in Fig. 13) is an idol with relatively large positive expansion
(21 choices). Eminence grise is clearly visible (blog antlan), and is chosen by jpc
without mutuality. Text analysis suggests that authors of both blogs are friends
from University, from the “real” life. The more experienced user (jpc) promotes
his friend’s weblog in bloggers’ community. This however does not work very
well — although blog jpc was established in November 2003 and is regularly
updated, blog antlan is an ephemeron. For the 5 months of its existence it was
updated only once.

In the Fig. 14 the basic sociometric structures are presented — diad which
is mutual positive choice between 2 persons and triad which is mutual positive
choice among 3 persons [1, 5, 6].

In the left picture of Fig. 15 the example of triad is shown — three mu-
tual choices from jogger.pl service. One can see that the positive expansion of
these blogs is small, despite relatively high sociometric status (with blog kalma
having the smallest number of choices within the triad). Text analysis provides
explanation of this — all three blogs belong to one family, a marriage with a
2 years old child. koraga is a blog describing events from child’s life written
from its “point of view” by his mother, kalma is a weblog of its father while ika
belongs to mother. Right picture of Fig. 15 shows the chain structure consisting
of a number of diads. Text analysis shows that these people are connected with

despite large outlook diﬀerences.

5 Summary

Sparsity is the ﬁrst apparent property of examined blogs networks. The highest
observed average vertex degree is 0.81, that means that most of the vertices are
not connected with others at all (about 90%).

γ coeﬃcients describing power–law of the decay of the vertex degree function
is below 3.0 in all examined services. That indicates that blogs are in fact scale–
free networks [8, 9].

We don’t observe notable increase of the average path length along with
the increasing graph size. While the number of vertices of blog.onet.pl and
blog.gery.pl services diﬀers by order of magnitude, the diﬀerence between their
average path lengths is only 0.84.
It can be observed that as the graph is
growing, we don’t need respectively longer paths to “travel” between its vertices.
That property is called small world [10].

The proportion between strong and weak relations in cliques doesn’t change
with the size of the graph. However, small graphs are dominated by very dense
(many connections) and loose cliques(no connections at all, isolated vertices).
That contrast could be explained by saying that in smaller communities some
people are very sociable, while others don’t tend to “connect” with others at
all. More balanced behaviour is rare.

13

In larger graphs, average cliquity is much greater (almost an order of mag-
nitude) than in smaller ones, so we reckon that larger structures tend to help
building stronger relations between their participants. In smaller structures the
border between the “liked” and isolated ones is much stronger.

We also tried to implement a sociometric analysis method, a domain of
microsociology, to analyse a large net of virtual interpersonal connections. Al-
though treating blog networks as such can be controversial, we believe that for
the purpose of this analysis such interpretation can be proved valid.

In large groups it is possible to ﬁnd some regular sociometric structures.
Structures described in this work were sociologically explainable despite vast
diﬀerences of relationships among blog authors.

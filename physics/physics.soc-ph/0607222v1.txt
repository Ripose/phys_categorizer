Abstract

Recent studies show that a negative shock in stock prices will generate more volatil-
ity than a positive shock of similar magnitude. The aim of this paper is to appraise
the hypothesis under which the conditional mean and the conditional variance of
stock returns are asymmetric functions of past information. We compare the results
for the Portuguese Stock Market Index PSI 20 with six other Stock Market Indices,
namely the SP 500, FTSE 100, DAX 30, CAC 40, ASE 20, and IBEX 35. In order
to assess asymmetric volatility we use autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity
speciﬁcations known as TARCH and EGARCH. We also test for asymmetry after
controlling for the eﬀect of macroeconomic factors on stock market returns using
TAR and M-TAR speciﬁcations within a VAR framework. Our results show that the
conditional variance is an asymmetric function of past innovations raising propor-
tionately more during market declines, a phenomenon known as the leverage eﬀect.
However, when we control for the eﬀect of changes in macroeconomic variables, we
ﬁnd no signiﬁcant evidence of asymmetric behaviour of the stock market returns.
There are some signs that the Portuguese Stock Market tends to show somewhat
less market eﬃciency than other markets since the eﬀect of the shocks appear to
take a longer time to dissipate.

Key words: Asymmetric conditional volatility, stock market returns, threshold
adjustment, vector autoregression

Introduction

It is well known in the ﬁnancial literature that stock market index returns are
positively autocorrelated, especially when dealing with high frequency data.
This fact has been often attributed to non-synchronous trading phenomena
(see e.g. Fischer [11], Scholes and Williams [20], and Lo and Mackinlay [15])
and to time-varying short-term expected returns, or risk premia in the sense

of Fama and French [10] and Conrad and Kaul [4]. It is also acknowledged in
the empirical literature that the unconditional distribution of returns appears
to be excessively leptokurtic for many stock market index prices. Hamao et
al.[14] and Wei et al.[21], for example, found the presence of excess kurtosis in
the normalized residuals in virtually all mature and emerging stock markets.
Mandelbrot [16] and Fama [9] deﬁne excess kurtosis when the return series ex-
hibit the fat-tailed feature and leptokurtosis when there is observable greater
excess kurtosis relatively to the normal distribution. Leptokurtosis may pose a
number of problems when trying to analyse empirically the dynamic behaviour
of stock markets. In order to deal with these problems, several authors have
attempted to use more general formulations of the distributions used in em-
pirical work (see for example Mandelbrot [16], Fama [9], and Nelson [17]).
However, the subject appears to be far from solved in a totally satisfying
manner.

Another issue obviously related to the previous one concerns the fact that
short-term stock returns usually exhibit volatility clustering. Links between
information and volatility of ﬁnancial assets are of course also central to ﬁnan-
cial economics. Ross [19], for example, argued that volatility could be regarded
as a measure of the information ﬂow. Moreover, as noted above, empirical re-
searchers also report signiﬁcant relationships between ﬂows and volatility.

Volatility clustering and excess kurtosis may arise in the context of asymmet-
ric behaviour of price index movements or their corresponding returns. Such
asymmetry may depend on other economic and ﬁnancial factors or simply
be the result of the time-path behaviour of the price index series itself. In
the latter case, the conditional variance may be an asymmetric function of
past innovations raising proportionately more during market declines. This
means that changes in stock prices or returns tend to be negatively related
to changes in volatility (see e.g. Black [2], and Christie [3]), i.e. the so-called
leverage eﬀect, where stock price declines increase the ﬁnancial leverage and,
consequently, the degree of risk (volatility).

Authors such as Engle [7], inter alia, defend the idea that ﬁnancial market
volatility can be predictable. In order to forecast the volatility, several meth-
ods have been proposed in the specialised literature, many of which are based
on regression-like models. Clearly, the classical regression model is unsuited
when the residuals exhibit features that depart from the basic OLS assump-
tions. Non-normality, autocorrelation, and heteroskedasticity are some of the
problems that are typically present in this type of data. In order to deal with
the problems of autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity, ARCH/GARCH spec-
iﬁcations are usually well suited. However, they assume that the conditional
variance has a symmetric behaviour and thus may not fully capture the issues
of non-normality. In our context, we shall use TARCH and EGARCH model
speciﬁcations to assess the extent of non-linear dynamic behaviour underly-

2

ing the stock prices data of various markets. The models used in this paper
belong to special classes of non-linear models that usually generalise the more
traditional autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity models.

Autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) models have been used
quite frequently in applied ﬁnancial research work. Among the most popular
extensions are the Threshold ARCH (TARCH) model proposed by Zakoian
[22] and Glosten et al. [13], and the Exponential GARCH (EGARCH) model
proposed by Nelson [17]. Engle and Ng [8] indicate that these latter volatility
models usually outperform standard GARCH models.

An alternative way for modelling the volatility of stock market returns is based
on a VAR speciﬁcation using other variables that may help to explain the be-
haviour of ﬁnancial markets. Since stock market returns and other macroeco-
nomic variables may all be endogenous in the system, the VAR speciﬁcation is
a quite satisfactory way for modelling the volatility. Testing for asymmetries
in this context entails the use of TAR and M-TAR tests of the VAR residuals
(see e.g. Enders and Granger [5], and Enders and Siklos [6]). It is important,
therefore, to obtain comparative results of the relative performance of these
two alternative types of volatility models, and this is the main aim of the
present paper.

1 Asymmetry and Volatility Models

The trade-oﬀ between risk and expected return is a foundation of modern
ﬁnancial theory, as can be seen in the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM),
Arbitrage Pricing Model (APT), Portfolio Theory, and Option Pricing The-
ory. In all these models, volatility plays a central role in determining the fair
value of a security. To quantify the risk level, several researchers have used
quantitative statistical indicators, where the standard deviation is one of the
most popular measures. This statistical measure, however, assumes a symmet-
ric variation of price levels. Yet, asymmetries are easily observed in time series
of ﬁnancial data, and already constitute an important phenomenon.

For example, there are good reasons to believe that speculative ﬁnancial asset
changes have in general an asymmetric behaviour. As mentioned above, the
leverage eﬀect was found in many empirical studies that analyse the behaviour
of stock returns. This circumstance highlights the need for using asymmetric
models when one is analysing data on stock market behaviour. Asymmetric
behaviour in ﬁnancial data can be detected with relatively ease, since volatil-
ity raises more for negative shocks than for positive shock with the same
amplitude. In order to account for this phenomenon, two extensions of the
basic GARCH model can be used, among other possibilities: the Threshold

3

Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (TARCH) and the Exponential
Generalised Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (EGARCH) mod-
els (see Nelson [17], Zakoian [22], and Glosten et al. [13]).

Additionally, this study also investigates the relationship between the volatility
terms for index returns and two macroeconomic variables: Dividend Yield (Dy)
and the Price Earnings per Share (PER). These variables will be used for TAR
and M-TAR tests based on a VAR model speciﬁcation as explained above. This
approach is similar to that used by Gjerde and Saettem [12] and Rapach [18].
Note that the daily frequency of the stock market returns variable imposes
restrictions on the choice and availability of other macroeconomic variables
that could also be of relevance but are not available with such a frequency.

1.1 The Data

The data used in this study consists of daily stock index closing prices for
seven stock market indices over a period from January 1993 until December
2002 (Datastream database). Stock returns were computed as the logarithm
of the ratio of the index values at time t and time t − 1. We consider the
following indices: the Standard and Poors 500 (SP500) to represent the whole
US economy, the CAC 40 index for France, the FTSE 100 for the UK, the
DAX for Germany, the IBEX 35 for Spain, the ASE 20 for Greece and ﬁnally,
the PSI 20 for Portugal.

The exchanges of Paris, London, Frankfurt, and New York represent four of
the world’s major centres for the trading and distribution of both domestic and
international equities with special interest for Portuguese investors, and this
justiﬁes their inclusion in the analysis. Furthermore, France and Germany are
viewed as “core” European economies, being members of the Exchange Rate
Mechanism since its inception in 1979, and of the European common currency
- the Euro - since 1999. The remaining stock markets are more similar to the
Portuguese stock market and we may expect somewhat similar results for the
three southern European countries.

1.2 Methodological Issues and Empirical Results

The existence of important inter-relationships between the major ﬁnancial
stock markets gives support to the use of VAR systems in the context of
the analysis of volatility. There is the need to understand how shocks and
volatility in one market are transmitted to other markets. To this end, we need
to look at the extent to which multi-lateral interaction exists between these

4

markets. Thus, after identifying the channels of interaction we can observe the
implications of volatility co-movements between diﬀerent markets.

VAR models have been increasingly used in the analysis of the relationships
between ﬁnancial markets. VAR models may be used with both stationary and
non-stationary data. In the latter case, they provide a convenient framework to
test for cointegration using the Johansen methodology, but the methodology is
far more general and is also quite useful when the variables are stationary. On
the other hand, ARCH/GARCH type models have been widely used to test
hypotheses concerning the conditional volatility of stock market returns. Both
methods can be employed to model volatility in the stock market. However, it
is important to note that employing these diﬀerent models, each one measures
and captures diﬀerent types of volatility.

TARCH and EGARCH models are especially adequate to model the volatility
measured in terms of error’s variance in the context of asymmetry. On the
other hand, TAR and M-TAR models systematise the volatility of the depen-
dent variables in a VAR system, captured from the corresponding residuals.
The TAR and M-TAR models based on VAR systems are especially designed to
capture asymmetric multivariate eﬀects in a multi-equation framework, which
certainly constitutes an important advantage over the single-equation multi-
variate TARCH and EGARCH models. However, one important disadvantage
of the former models is that they do not account for conditional heteroskedas-
ticity that may be present in the data.

The ﬁrst step of our analysis consists of estimating univariate TARCH(1,1)
and EGARCH(1,1) models in order to assess whether our series exhibit or not
some type of conditional volatility asymmetric behaviour. For the TARCH
model we use the following speciﬁcation of the conditional variance:

t = ω + αε2
σ2

t−1 + γε2

t−1dt−1 + βσ2

t−1

(1)

t is a function of the past squared residuals ε2

where the variance σ2
t−1, and of
its own lagged values σ2
t−1. The variable dt−1 is a dummy variable equal to one
if εt−1 > 0, and equal to zero otherwise. ω, α, γ, and β are the parameters of
the conditional variance equation that will be estimated. The equation of the
conditional variance for the EGARCH model takes the following form: log σ2
t =
εt−1
ω + β log σ2
σt−1 where the symbols are as described earlier.
The results of the univariate TARCH and EGARCH models are reported in
Figure 1.

t−1 + α (cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

εt−1
σt−1 (cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

+ γ

As can be seen, the estimates of α are almost all signiﬁcantly positive, except
for the US and UK, where we found no signiﬁcant α coeﬃcients when the
TARCH model was used. In this model, we obtain good news (εt ≤ 0) and
bad news (εt > 0). This means that the model has diﬀerential eﬀects on the
conditional variance – good news has an impact on α, while bad news has

5

an impact on α + γ. We say that the leverage eﬀect exists if γ 6= 0 and
an asymmetric eﬀect is observed if γ > 0. The leverage eﬀect expressed in
ε2
t−1dt−1 is associated with the parameter γ in equation (1), and at the same
time it must reveal statistical signiﬁcance for both models in Figure 1. In the
EGARCH speciﬁcation, the asymmetric behaviour exists if γ < 0.

Another important result to note is that the estimate of β in the EGARCH
model is less than one for all the markets, which implies that all the moments
of the relevant statistical distribution exist and that the quasi-maximum like-
lihood estimators are likely to be consistent and asymptotically normal. Thus,
relatively to the results reported in Fig. 1, we may conclude that the leverage
eﬀect hypothesis cannot be rejected in any case. Likewise, there is evidence of
an asymmetric behaviour of the stock markets for all the countries analysed.

Fig. 1. TARCH(1,1) and EGARCH(1,1) results

A more detailed analysis of the results reported in Fig 1 reveals that the coeﬃ-
cient α for Portugal is higher than the corresponding values for the remaining

6

markets, both for the TARCH and EGARCH models. 1 These ﬁgures imply
that shocks in the Portuguese stock market tend to have longer durations, or
higher persistence. As Bala and Prematne [1] state, this circumstance implies
that the eﬀect of shocks in earlier periods for Portugal tend to linger around
for a longer period than it does in other stock markets. One possible expla-
nation for this result is that it may imply that the Portuguese stock market
shows less market eﬃciency than the other markets analysed, since the eﬀects
of shocks take longer time to dissipate.

However, one should note that this does not mean that the Portuguese stock
market is not eﬃcient. Our results should just be analysed in relative terms
and comparatively with other markets.

We turn now to consider the results of multivariate TARCH and EGARCH
models where the Portuguese stock market index is the dependent variable, in
order to obtain the OLS residuals, and take the remaining market indices suc-
cessively as the independent market index for all possible relations established
with the Portuguese stock market. These results may bring new information
relatively to the results of Fig. 1, since it is quite likely that the stock markets
establish interactions between them. We restrict our analysis to the interac-
tions between the Portuguese stock market and the remaining markets, suc-
cessively, and we estimate multivariate TARCH and EGARCH models. The
results reported in Fig. 2 are very similar to those reported earlier and lead in
general to the same conclusions. The estimated coeﬃcients, however, appear
now signiﬁcant in all cases.

We are now going to test the possibility that an adjustment process occurs for
diﬀerent stock market price index combinations with the Portuguese index,
which have asymmetric cycles in the respective time series. For this test we
employ the methodology of TAR and M-TAR models, where the indices appear
as endogenous variables and the macroeconomic factors as control exogenous
variables.

The basic starting point for this analysis is the long-run relationship between
the relevant variables to the model. The long-run equilibrium relationship
between two time series zt and xt can be estimated as a standard regression
model zt = α+βxt +µt, where α and β are the estimated parameters, and µt is
a disturbance term that may be serially correlated. The parameter β gives the
magnitude of adjustment of z to variations in x, and is the long-run elasticity
of the two variables if they are measured in logs. If β < 1, then shifts in x are
not fully passed onto z.

The second step of the methodology focuses on the OLS estimates of ρ1 and

1 Except for Greece in the EGARCH model, whose value of α is 0.2602, whereas
for Portugal is 0.2349.

ρ2 in the following error correction model:

∆µt = Itρ1µt−1 + (1 − It)ρ2µt−1 + εt

where εt is a white noise disturbance and the residuals from the long-run
equation are used to estimate ∆µt. It is the Heaviside indicator function such
that

.





If in (4) ξt−1 = µt−1, then the model speciﬁcation illustrated in (2) is called
the threshold autoregressive (TAR) model. It allows for diﬀerent coeﬃcients of
positive and negative variations. A suﬃcient condition for the stationarity of
µt is −2 < (ρ1,ρ2)< 0. This means that the long-run equation is an attractor

8

such that µt can be written as an error correction model similar to that given
in (2). If ρ1 = ρ2 then the adjustment is symmetric, which is a special case of
(2) and (3). Expression (2) can also contain lagged values of ∆µ. When µt is
above its long-run equilibrium value, the adjustment is ρ1µt−1, and if µt−1 is
below its long-run equilibrium value, the adjustment is ρ2µt−1.

If in (3) ξt−1 = ∆µt−1, then the model (2) is called the momentum threshold
autoregressive (M-TAR) model. The M-TAR model allows the decay to depend
on the previous period change in µt−1. The value of the threshold τ , in our
case, will be assumed to be zero in all models.

The TAR model is designed to capture asymmetrically deep movements in
the series of the deviations from the long-run equilibrium, while the M-TAR
model is useful to capture the possibility of asymmetrically steep movements
in the series (Enders and Granger [5]). For example, in the TAR model if
−1 < ρ1 < ρ2 < 0, then the negative phase of µt will tend to be more
persistent than the positive phase. On the other hand, for the M-TAR model,
if for example |ρ1| < |ρ2| the model exhibits little decay for positive ∆µt−1
but substantial decay for negative ∆µt−1. This means that increases tend to
persist but decreases tend to revert quickly toward the attractor.

Finally, we can perform a number of statistical tests on the estimated coef-
ﬁcients (and also on the residuals) in order to ascertain the validity of the
error correction model outlined in (2), and subsequently if the adjustment is
symmetric or not. The relevant tests on the coeﬃcients are H0 : ρ1 = 0 and
H0 : ρ2 = 0, for which we obtain the sample values of the t-statistics; and
H0 : ρ1 = ρ2 = 0 , for which we obtain the sample values of the F -statistic.
The restriction that adjustment is symmetric, i.e. H0 : ρ1 = ρ2, can also be
tested using the usual F -statistic.

If the variables in the long-run equation are stationary, the usual critical val-
ues of the t and F distributions can be used to assess the signiﬁcance level of
the underlying tests. However, if these variables are integrated of ﬁrst order,
one can use the critical values reported by Enders and Siklos [6] to deter-
mine whether the null hypothesis of no cointegration can be rejected. If the
alternative hypothesis is accepted, it is possible to test for asymmetric adjust-
ment using the standard critical values of the F distribution, since ρ1 and ρ2
converge to a multivariate normal distribution (Enders and Granger [5]).

Fig. 3 contains the results of the TAR and M-TAR models. As may be seen,
for the ﬁrst two tests the null hypothesis is rejected in all cases. Thus, we may
proceed our analysis with the tests of symmetry and the results are that the
null hypothesis is not rejected in any of the models considered.

2 Conclusions

This paper presents a comparative analysis between four volatility models
(TARCH, EGARCH, TAR and M-TAR) in order to ascertain their power
to capture asymmetric cycles in the underlying time series. Our results indi-
cate that while the TAR and M-TAR models do not identify the presence of
asymmetry in any market, the TARCH and EGARCH models have captured
asymmetry in all cases under analysis.

Another relevant conclusion from the multivariate TARCH and EGARCH
results is that the Portuguese stock market appears to reveal higher α values
than the remaining markets, for both models. These ﬁgures imply that shocks
in the Portuguese market, in the later periods, tend to have longer duration
periods. This circumstance implies that the eﬀects of shocks in earlier periods
tend to linger around for a longer period than it does in other stock markets.
This means that for the Portuguese stock market the eﬀects of shocks take a
longer time to dissipate.

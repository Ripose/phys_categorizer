Abstract: The Nowak modiﬁcation of the Sznajd opinion dynamics model on
the square lattice assumes that with probabilities β and γ the opinions ﬂip due
to mass-media advertising from down to up, and vice versa. Besides, with proba-
bility α the Sznajd rule applies that a neighbour pair agreeing in its two opinions
convinces all its six neighbours of that opinion. Our Monte Carlo simulations and
mean-ﬁeld theory ﬁnd sharp phase transitions in the parameter space.

1 Introduction and Model

A true capital of a country has to coordinate the various regions of that country.
In this sense, we apply here the suggestion of Nowak (Warszawa) to modify the
Sznajd (Wroc law) model of opinion dynamics.

In the Sznajd opinion dynamics model [1, 2] on the square lattice each site
(“agent”) can have one of two possible opinions: up (1) or down (0). Two neigh-
bouring sites having the same opinion convince their six neighbours of that opinion.

Figure 1: Distribution of up opinions when initially one percent of the agents
had opinion up at randomly selected sites. The upper part had a lower
ﬂipping probability β = γ = 0.10 than the lower part (0.15), and in the
lower part the two opinions occur about equally often.

This model simulates the psychological eﬀect that two people in agreement con-
vince better than one person or than two disagreeing people [3]. A sharp phase
transition results for large lattices if initially a fraction p of the opinions is up
randomly: For p > 1/2 at the end everybody has opinion up, and for p < 1/2
everybody ends up with opinion down.

A. Nowak at the GIACS summer school “Applications of Complex Systems
to Social Sciences” in September 2006 suggested to generalise this Sznajd model
by ﬂipping each up opinion down with probability γ and each down opinion up
with probability β, taking into account global eﬀects like advertising through mass
media [4]. The traditional pair-convincing is applied to each of the six neighbours

independently with probability α. Obviously, for positive β and γ no complete
consensus is possible anymore, but we can still search for phase transitions where
the fraction of up opinions jumps as a function of some continuously varying pa-
rameter (α, β, γ, p).

With β 6= γ we destroy up-down symmetry; this symmetry can also be de-
stroyed by assuming that only up pairs convince down opinions to ﬂip up: Directed
convincing as opposed to the usual undirected convincing.

The next section brings a mean ﬁeld approximation, and section 3 our simula-

tion results, followed by a concluding section 4.

and one for L = 101 and 201; t = 105. In some cases the larger lattices seem
not yet have found their equilibrium.

2 Mean-Field Approximation

In the symmetric case when γ = β, the appropriate Master equation [5] for the
probability p of having up opinion, S = 1, is

dp
dt

= −βp + β(1 − p) + αp

(1 − p) − αp(1 − p)

In this equation, the ﬁrst term on the r.h.s. is responsible for spontaneous switching
from S = 0 to S = 1, the second term - for the opposite, the third - for the switching
from 0 to 1 when two neighbours are 1, and the fourth term - for the switching
from 1 to 0 when two neighsours are 0.
In the mean ﬁeld approximation, the
spatial neighbouring between those neighbours is neglected. Introducing a quasi-
magnetisation m ≡ 2p − 1 we get

initial concentration

Figure 4: Possible jump as a function of initial concentration if β = γ is ﬁxed
at 0.10 (+, jump) and 0.15 (x, no jump).

For the ﬁxed points m∗ where dm/dt = 0, the only relevant is the parameter
x ≡ β/α. As the result we get m∗ = 0 or ±(1 − 4x)1/2. The ﬁxed point is stable
if the derivative of the r.h.s. of the last equation with respect to m is negative,
and it is not stable if it is positive. Here m∗ = 0 is stable if x > 1/4, and the
remaining two ﬁxed points exist and are stable if x < 1/4. This is an example of
the supercritical pitchfork bifurcation [6]. As we see, the result of the mean ﬁeld
theory is that the phase transition exists and is continuous. The transition point is
at βc = α/4. Above this value, the spontaneous ﬂipping destroys the correlations
between neighbours; those correlations enable the Sznajd process and lead to the
ordering. For β = γ = 0, the result m∗ = 0 or ±1 agrees with former mean-ﬁeld
approach to the Sznajd model [7].

alpha

Figure 5: Phase transition as a function of α, at ﬁxed β = γ = 0.1. Only for
L > 100 a broken symmetry is clearly visible for large α.

p = 0.01 initially and α = 1; β = γ = 0.15 in the upper and 0.20 in the lower
part of this ﬁgure. Figure 1 shows eﬀects of our helical boundary conditions in
horizontal direction, since the clusters ending at the right border are continued on
the left border. We see short-range correlations due to the pair-convincing process:
The ﬁnal opinions are not distributed randomly in space even though we started
with opinions randomly distributed on the lattice.

Fig.2 shows more quantitatively the transition between β = γ = 0.1 and 0.2:
For low ﬂipping probabilities β, γ the pair convincing process dominates and most
opinions follow the initial majority. For higher ﬂipping probabilities near and above
0.2 the ﬂipping probabilities overwhelm the pair-convincing process and half of the
opinions become up, the other half down. We see overlapping curves independent
of L. The lower part is an expanded plot for the transition region of the upper
part. Thus there is a second-order phase transition at βc = γc = 0.13 ± 0.01 since
for a jump (ﬁrst-order transition) the curves would become steeper and steeper for
larger and larger L.

The same transition can also be observed starting from p = 1/2, Fig.3, instead

of 0.01 as in Fig.2. There, for low ﬂipping probabilities one of the two opinions
randomly has to win over the other, which takes more time; thus only smaller L
are shown in Fig.3.

In an Ising model, the magnetisation shows a second-order transition, as in
Fig.3, if the temperature is varied at zero magnetic ﬁeld, but a ﬁrst-order tran-
sition (jump) if the magnetic ﬁeld is varied at constant temperature below Tc.
Somewhat analogously, Fig.4 shows this ﬁrst-order transition as a function of ini-
tial concentration at ﬁxed low β = 0.10 but not at higher β = 0.15.

In all the above ﬁgures we had α = 1; for α < 1 the pair convincing process
not always works, and according to Fig.5 α > 1/2 at β = γ = 0.1 is needed to
preserve the phase transition (initially, p = 0).

Finally Fig.6 shows the lack of the phase transition if the symmetric pair-
convincing process is replaced by the directed one: Two neighbouring up opinions
convince the six neighbours; two neighbouring down opinions convince nobody.
We get the same results whether we start from p = 0.01 or 0.99, and whether we

7

use L = 101 or 201. Also if up pairs convince with probability 1 and down pairs
convince with probability 1/2, we get the same smooth curve whether we start
with p = 0.01 or 0.09.

4 Conclusion

With a minor addition (γ) to the previously simulated Sznajd model with advertis-
ing [4] we could see a new second-order phase transition in this opinion dynamics.
In contrast to [4] the position of the transition is independent of L. On one side
the traditional pair-convincing process dominates, on the other side the random
opinion ﬂips. This phase transition is predicted by a mean ﬁeld theory, but the
mean-ﬁeld position of the transition is twice as high as simulated for α = 1.

Abstract. - We focus on the role played by the node degree distribution on the way collective
phenomena emerge on complex networks. To address this question, we focus analytically on a
typical model for cooperative behaviour, the Majority Rule, applied to dichotomous networks.
The latter are composed of two kinds of nodes, each kind i being characterized by a degree
ki. Dichotomous networks are therefore a simple instance of heterogeneous networks, especially
adapted in order to reveal the eﬀect of degree dispersity. Our main result are that degree dispersity
aﬀects the location of the order-disorder transition and that the system exhibits non-equipartition
of the average opinion between the two kinds of nodes. This eﬀect is observed in the ordered
phase and in the disordered phase.

Introduction. – It is more and more common, nowa-
days, to use models and tools from Statistical Physics in
order to describe the emergence of collective phenomena in
social systems. Amongst other examples, one may think of
opinion formation [1,2], rumour or disease spreading [3,4],
language dynamics [5], etc. In these models, agents are
located at the node of a graph and are endowed with a
ﬁnite number of available states, e.g. two states - spin up
and spin down. The links between nodes represent the
relations (e.g. friendship, co-authorship) between agents.
Most of the models are based on local attractive interac-
tions, i.e. agents copy the behaviour of their direct neigh-
bours, while random changes also take place, thereby mim-
icking the eﬀect of individual choices. Contrary to classi-
cal problems of Statistical Physics, though, the underlying
network structure is not a d-dimensional regular lattice,
but a complex network [6], whose node degree (number
of links per node) and other internal properties may vary
from one node to another.

Several works have revealed that a given model may
exhibit very diﬀerent (even qualitatively) behaviours de-
pending on its underlying topologies [4]. Important fac-
tors are for instance the degree heterogeneity [7], the pres-
ence of communities [8] or the small-world property [9].
From a practical point of view, it is therefore important
to elucidate how these structural properties aﬀect critical
behaviour if one intends to reproduce the emergence of
collective phenomena as they take place in realistic situ-
ations. A typical example would be the propagation of

rumours in a social network, that is of primordial inter-
est for viral marketing issues. From a theoretical point
of view, it is challenging to develop tools and methods in
order to determine the inﬂuence of the network topology
on the way the system orders (or not). Such theoretical
studies have been performed in some speciﬁc cases, e.g.
the Voter Model [7] or the Unanimity Model [10], but a
coherent and unifying framework is still needed.

In this Letter, we address this problem by focusing on a
variant of the majority rule model (MR), that is a typical
model for consensus formation [1]. Its simple ingredients
allow a very complete analytical description in the mean-
ﬁeld approximation [11]. One should stress that, contrary
to the voter model [12], MR does not conserve average
magnetization [13]. In the following, we focus on a variant
of MR that includes random ﬂips (thermal ﬂuctuations)
and study analytically the eﬀect of the degree dispersity
on the phase diagram. To do so, we introduce dichotomous
networks, in which there are two sorts of nodes, each sort
being characterized by a degree k1 or k2. It is shown that
the system undergoes a transition from a disordered phase
to an ordered phase for weak enough random eﬀects (
∼
low temperature). Our main results are that the location
of this transition depends on the degree dispersity α
≡
k2/k1. Moreover, the system is shown to exhibit non-
equipartition of the average magnetization (e.g. each sort
of nodes is characterized by a diﬀerent average) when α
=
1. This is observed in the ordered and in the disordered
phase.

Majority Rule. – The network is composed of N
nodes, each of them endowed with an opinion oi that can
be α or β. At each time step, one of the nodes is ran-

ii) With probability 1
q, two neighbouring nodes of s are
also selected and the three agents in this majority triplet
all adopt the state of the local majority. The parameter
q therefore measures the competition between individual
choices, that have a tendency to randomize the system,
and neighbouring interactions, that tend to homogenize
the opinion of agents. In the case q = 0, it is well-known
that the system asymptotically reaches global consensus
where all nodes share the same opinion [11]. In the other
limiting case q = 1, the system is purely random and
the average (over the realizations of the random process)
number of nodes with opinion α at time t, denoted by At,
goes to N/2.

Homogeneous network. – In this section, we as-
sume that the network of individuals is highly connected
and homogeneous, i.e. all the nodes have the same degree.
In that case, the mean-ﬁeld rate equation for At reads

At+1 = At + q(

3a + 2a2),

(2)

where at = At/N is the average proportion of nodes with
opinion α. The term proportional to q accounts for the
random ﬂips and the last term for local majorities. This
comes from the fact that the probability for two nodes
α (β) and one node β (α) to be selected is 3a2(1

Let us stress that eq. (3) diﬀers from eq. (2) of [10] by
a factor 3. In [10], this factor could be absorbed in the
time scale as it did not play a relevant role. It is straight-
forward to show that a = 1/2 is always a stationary solu-
tion of eq. (2), as expected from symmetry reasons. This
is obvious after rewriting the evolution equation for the
quantities ∆ = A

from which one ﬁnds that the symmetric solution a = 1/2
ceases to be stable when q < 3/5, and that the system
reaches the following asymmetric solutions in that case

(cid:1)

The system therefore undergoes an order-disorder transi-
tion at q = 3/5. Under this value, a collective opinion
has emerged due to the imitation between neighbouring
nodes. Let us stress that eqs. (5) respectively converge to
a− = 0 and a+ = 1 in the limit q

0.

Degree heterogeneity. – The main goal of this Let-
ter is to understand how the degree distribution of the
underlying network aﬀects collective behaviours as those
of the previous section. Contrary to more phenomeno-
logical approaches, where the eﬀects of the degree hetero-
geneity are brought to light by comparing the behaviour
of a model on several kinds of networks [14] (e.g. Erd¨os-
Renyi, scale-free, etc), we prefer to address the problem
from an analytical and more fundamental point of view.
To do so, we generalize homogeneous networks in the most
natural way by considering random networks whose nodes
may be divided into two classes, the nodes in diﬀerent
classes being characterized by a diﬀerent degree, k1 or k2.
This binary mixture, that we call a dichotomous network
is particularly suitable in order to reveal the role of de-
gree distribution. Indeed, the degree dispersity is tunable
through the parameter α = k2/k1. When α
1, one
recovers an homogeneous network.

→

The underlying topology is therefore determined by the
values k1 and k2, and by Nk1 and Nk2 that are the num-
ber of nodes of each class. In the following, we will as-
sume that Nk1 = Nk2 for the sake of simplicity. A more
complete analysis for the full range of parameters will be
considered elsewhere. We are interested in A1;t and A2;t
that are the average number of nodes 1 and 2 with opin-
ion α. By construction, each node is selected with the
same probability during one time step, but those with a
higher degree have a larger probability to be among the
neighbours of the selected node, i.e. to be in the majority
triplet. This eﬀect will have to be taken into account in
order to generalize eq. (2).

By construction, the probability that the selected node
has a degree ki is 1/2, but the probability that the neigh-
bour of this selected node has a degree kj is kj/(k1 + k2)
(one assumes that there are no correlations between the
degrees of neighbouring nodes). Consequently, the proba-
bility that the selected node has a degree k1 and that both
of its selected neighbours have a degree k2 is

k2
2
2(k1 + k2)2 =

α2
2(1 + α)2 .

Similarly, the probability that the selected node has a de-
gree k1, that one of its neighbours has a degree k1 and
that the other neighbour has a degree k2 is

(k1 + k2)2 =

The sum of these three probabilities is normalized and the
probabilities of events when the selected node has a degree

where bi is the proportion of nodes with opinion β in the

tions for A1 and A2 that eq. (2) is recovered in the limit
α = 1 (with a = (a1 + a2)/2), as expected due to the
indistinguishability of the nodes in that case.

It is easy to show that a1 = a2 = 1/2 is always a station-
ary solution of the above set of equations. The stability
analysis is performed by looking at deviations to this so-
lution a1 = 1/2 + δ1, a2 = 1/2 + δ2 and keeping only
linear corrections. In the continuous time limit and after
re-scaling the time units, the evolution equations for these
deviations read

The stability analysis requires to look at the eigenvalues of
the above evolution matrix and to ﬁnd the critical value of
q at which the real part of one eigenvalue becomes positive.

where K = 2 + 8α + 16α2 + 8α3 + 2α4. In the limiting
1, one recovers the known result qC = 3/5. It
case α
is also possible to verify (see ﬁg. 1) that this relation is
α−1, i.e. under an
symmetric under the changes α
exchange of nodes 1 and 2. Moreover, the maximum value
) = (1 +
is obtained for α
2√2)/(7 + 2√2). Our ﬁrst conclusion is therefore that the
location of the order-disorder transition depends in a non-
trivial way on the degree dispersity α, even though these
deviations remain of small magnitude (maximum 10%).

ferent asymptotic values a1,∞
of nodes with the higher degree exhibit larger deviations
to 1/2 than the other class. This may be understood
by the fact that nodes with a higher degree are more of-
ten selected in majority triplets, thereby triggering their
tendency to reach consensus.
In order to evaluate this
non-equipartition of the average opinion between the two
species of nodes, we introduce the ratio ∆ = δ2/δ1. One
observes that ∆ = 1 when α = 1 and that increasing val-
ues of α lead to increasing values of ∆ at ﬁxed q.

if one calculates the time evolution of ∆ from eqs. (11)
above the critical point qC , one ﬁnds that this quantity
asymptotically converges to a constant value diﬀerent of
zero ∆∞
In contrast, we have shown above that
the deviations δ1 and δ2 go to zero for these values of q
(ai = 1/2 is a stable solution). Altogether, this suggests
that the relaxation to the asymptotic state behaves like
δ1 = C1e−λ1t, δ2 = C2e−λ2t, where the relaxation rates
are the same λ1 = λ2 and where C2 = ∆∞C1. This be-
haviour reminds the non-equipartition of energy taking
place in inelastic gases, for which it is well-known that
diﬀerent components of a mixture may exhibit diﬀerent
partial temperatures [15]. This parallel is clear after not-
ing the similarities between the linearized equations (11)
and the equations for the partial temperatures Ti [16] ob-
tained from Inelastic Maxwell Models [17].

Simulation results. – By construction, the random
steps of MR are easy to implement in a computer sim-
ulation. The only diﬃculty is to build the underlying
dichotomous network, i.e. a network in which there are
two characteristic node degrees but without internal cor-
relations. We tackle this problem by applying a method

reminiscent of networks with hidden variables [18–20] and
Superstatistics [21–23]. Namely, we ﬁrst prepare N nodes
and assign them hidden variables hi < 1, half of the nodes
receiving the hidden variable hi = p1 and the other half
the hidden variable hi = p2. Next, each pair of nodes (i, j)
receives a link with a probability equal to
hihj < 1. Let
us introduce αS = p2/p1 that measures the hidden vari-
able dispersity. From the above deﬁnitions, one ﬁnds that
the degree distributions of the nodes 1 and 2 are peaked
around

in MR should also take place in other models for opinion
formation and is certainly a striking consequence of the
dependence of the agent opinion on its connectivity.

of eqs. (11) under the critical value qC , but it is not ap-
plicable in order to measure ∆ above this critical value.
This is due to the fact that non-equipartition of opinion
takes place during the relaxation to the asymptotic so-
lution ai = 1/2 when q > qC and that this relaxation
is indiscernible from the ﬁnite size ﬂuctuations around
ai = 1/2 in the long time limit. Consequently, we use
another strategy in order to measure ∆ when q > qC .
Namely, the simulation is started from ai = 0.7, but ∆
is now evaluated during the relaxation, i.e. after 50 time
steps/node, and averaged over 5000 realizations of the ran-
dom process. These simulation results are in very good
agreement with eq. (17) (at least for q < 0.8, above which
ﬂuctuations are very large) and conﬁrm that ∆ does not
depend on q in the disordered phase.

Short discussion. – To conclude, we would like to
insist on the fact that the formalism used in this Letter is
very general and that it could be applied to other mod-
els for cooperative behaviour, e.g. Ising models, language
dynamics, etc. In particular, we have shown that dichoto-
mous networks are useful tools in order to examine the role
of the degree distribution on the emergence of collective
phenomena. The non-equipartition of opinion observed

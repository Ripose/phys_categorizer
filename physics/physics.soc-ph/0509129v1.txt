Tomography of random social networks∗

Erik Volz†

December 31, 2013

Abstract

We study the statistical properties of large random networks with
speciﬁed degree distributions. New techniques are presented for an-
alyzing the structure of social networks. Speciﬁcally, we address the
question of how many nodes exist at a distance from a given node.
We also explore the degree distribution of for nodes at some distance
from a given node. Implications for network sampling and diﬀusion
on social networks are described.

1 Introduction

Random network models have a long history in the social networks literature.
Rapoport et. al. were the ﬁrst to propose random graphs as models of social
networks [19, 20, 21], while simultaneously the basic theory of random graphs
was established in the mathematics literature by Erd˝os et. al [3]. Thereafter,
periodic eﬀorts were made to specify with greater detail the random or sta-
tistical nature of social networks, for example with the biased random net
theory of Frank [6], Skvoretz [24], Fararo [4, 5], and others.

More recently, signiﬁcant contributions have been made by statistical
physicists, especially regarding the aggregate statistical attributes of net-
works [13, 18, 15]. The degree distribution has been shown to be one of
the most important features of a network in determining network structure.

Consequently, random networks with speciﬁed degree distributions have been
proposed as a model of large, complex social networks [14, 10, 16, 17].

In this article, we describe techniques for revealing subtle aspects of net-
work structure, taking as given a certain degree distribution. Our method
relies on network tomography [11], the idea of mapping out a network layer
by layer from a single node. The method is described in section 2 below.

The appropriateness of the random graph model must vary from pop-
ulation to population. Certainly a degree distribution does not determine
the overall structure of a network. It is possible for a network with a given
degree sequence to have extreme diﬀerences from a corresponding random
network [17, 27, 25]. But even in such cases, diﬀerences are likely to be infor-
mative, suggesting unique mechanisms that move a network away from the
random regime.

This work has implications for networks sampling, the study of diﬀu-
sion and mathematical epidemiology, as well as other dynamic processes on
networks. All of these problems involve the marriage of network structure
with network dynamics. To answer dynamical questions, it is desirable to
specify network structure with greater precision. Unfortunately, even in ran-
dom networks of the type studied here, namely semi-random networks with
given degree distributions, there are many topological questions which re-
main unanswered. We will focus on two: 1. How many individuals are there
at any distance from a given node? 2. Among all nodes at a given distance,
what is the degree distribution among those nodes? Example applications
are further described in section 5.

2 Network tomography

In all that follows, we assume a network size n, and a degree distribution
pk (The probability of a node being degree k is pk). Multiple connections
and loops are allowed, however it should be noted that such connections
are exceedingly rare for large n. Our networks are undirected. Connections
within the network are entirely random but for these constraints.

Having constructed such a network, we can play the following thought
experiment. Pick a node, v0 uniformly at random within the giant component
of the network1. We will call v0 the seed. This node will have a degree ≥ 1,
1A component in a network is a maximal set of nodes such that there exists a path
between any two of them. A giant component is a component which occupies a fraction

2

and a number of neighbors at distance one. Those nodes in turn will have
a degree distribution speciﬁc to themselves, and a number of connections to
other nodes at distance two from v0. We can continue in this way, eventually
breaking the entire giant component into disjoint sets deﬁned by the distance
from our seed. Some nodes may not be enumerated in this way, in which
event they fall outside of the giant component.

What we just described is the basic premise of network tomography.Network

tomography, originally described in [11], is a method for revealing the struc-
ture of a random network by exploration, layer by layer, from a single starting
node.

Now we can ask a host of questions with consequences for the structure

of the network as a whole:

• How many nodes are there at distance l from the seed v0?

• What is the degree distribution within each layer?

• What is the size of the giant component?

• What is the degree distribution within the giant component versus

outside the giant component?

• What is the expected centrality of a seed v0 picked at random in this

way? What about the centrality of a degree k node?

All of these questions can be answered as outlined below. The method is
shown schematically in ﬁgure 1.

Let Sl be the number of connections originating from layer l. For example,
for l = 0, S0 is the degree of v0. Let Rl be the number of connections from
layer l − 1 to layer l. Finally, let Tl be the number of connections originating
from nodes outside of layers m ≤ l.

Let S0 = z0 where z0 is the average degree in the giant component of
the network2. T0 = nz − z0, where z is the average degree in the network
as a whole, and R0 = 0. To continue mapping out the network, we need a

of the nodes in the network in the limit of large network size.

2We can choose any degree for our seed, though some of the statistics we derive will be

dependent on this parameter.

Schematic of the network tomograhic method

Figure 1: This diagram illustrates the tomographic method detailed in the
text. Starting from a single node v0 we recursively explore nodes at distance
l from v0. Rl is the number of connections going to layer l from layer l − 1.
Sl is the number of connections to nodes in layer l. Tl is the number of
connections not connected to nodes in layer l or less. The importance of
these quantities is explained in the text.

recurrence relation on these quantities:

Sl+1 = fS(Sl, Tl, Rl)
Tl+1 = fT (Sl, Tl, Rl)
Rl+1 = fR(Sl, Tl, Rl)

To proceed further, and determine the exact form of f·(·), we will need to
draw on a technique widely employed in the complex networks literature, the
probability generating function. Probability generating functions have found
numerous applications to the study of complex networks. The ﬁrst examples
were given in [13, 14]. A good general reference to generating function meth-
ods is [30], and applications of generating functions to branching processes
are given in [8] and [1].

Probability generating functions are created by transformation of discrete
probability distributions into the space of polynomials. We will need just one
generating function corresponding to our degree distribution:

g(x) = p0 + p1x + p2x2 + · · ·

(1)

Frequently we ﬁnd that generating functions converge to simple algebraic
functions, in which cases we can perform any operation on the algebraic
version of the generating function instead of the series expansion. This con-
stitutes one of the primary uses of probability generating functions.

In the examples that follow we will concern ourselves with two easy to

study degree distributions:

1. Poisson. This is the degree distribution of classical random graphs
. This is

as studied by the Erd˝os and Rapoport among others. pk = zke−z
generated by

k

2. Exponential. pk = (1 − e−1/z)e−k/z. This is generated by

(2)

(3)

See [15] for a derivation of these generating functions.

Returning to the tomographics problem, consider the probability that a
connection emerging from layer l will go to a node in layer l + 1, given that
the connection does not go to layer l − 1. Since our networks are completely

g(x) = ez(x−1)

g(x) =

1 − e−1/z
1 − xe−1/z

5

random, such a connection has uniform probability of going to any of the
“stubs” originating from nodes in layers m > l, as well as stubs originating
from nodes in layer l, minus those stubs which are already allotted to layer
l − 1. This gives us the following:

For convenience, we now deﬁne the following quantity:

Pl→l+1 =

Tl
Tl + Sl − Rl

αl = αl−1

Tl
Tl + Sl − Rl

This is the probability of a conjunction of events, namely that a connection
goes to a node outside of layer l, given that the connection has not attached
to layers m < l.

Note that the probability that a degree k node lies outside the ﬁrst l
layers is the probability that all k of the nodes connections go to other nodes
outside of layers m ≤ l. This is simply αk

l−1.

Now it can be asked: What is the average degree of a node outside of

layers m ≤ l? We have

< k >Tl=

αk pk k/c

X
k

(4)

where c is the appropriate normalizing constant:

c =

αkpk

X
k

The value of our generating function approach is now apparent, as we can
easily express the above in terms of our generating function g(x):

< k >Tl= n[

]x=1/g(αl) = αlg′(αl)/g(α)

(5)

d g(αlx)
dx

By similar reasoning, the total number of connections originating from

nodes outside of layer l + 1 is:

Tl+1 = n[

d g(αlx)
dx

]x=1 = n αl g′(αl)

(6)

6

Once this is known, S and R follow easily. S is equivalent to the change
in the number of connections between two adjacent layers. R will be the
expected number of connections going between two adjacent layers. We have:

Sl+1 = Tl − Tl+1
Tl
Tl + Sl − Rl

Rl+1 = Sl

= Slαl/αl−1

This recurrence relation can be solved to any desired depth. Below it
will be shown that many interesting quantities can be computed from the
sequences of S,T, and R. 3

2.1 Descriptive statistics

Let’s return the questions from section 2. With the simple recurrence rela-
tion 6 and 7 we can now characterize many feature of our network. Once a
sequence of values of Sl, Rl, and Tl have been computed, it is quite simple
to determine many things about the structure of our network by plugging in
the appropriate values into our generating functions.

Of foremost importance is the size of each layer, that is the number of
nodes at some distance from our seed. We know that the probability of a
degree k node being outside layer l is αk
l . Then the probability of a degree k
node being within layer l is αk
l . So, choosing a node at random, the
probability of that node being in layer l will be
l ). Translating
this into our generating function language, and multiplying by the population
size n, we have

Pk pk(αk

l−1 − αk

l−1 −αk

nl = n(g(αl−1) − g(αl))

(7)

3It is worth noting that the recurrence relation on S,T, and R can be simpliﬁed to a re-
currence relation on just two variables, due to that S is not a function of itself. Speciﬁcally,
by eliminating S, we get

and

Tl+1 = n

d
dx [g(αl+1x)]x=1
g(αl)

Rl+1 =

Tl(Tl−1 − Tl)
Tl−1 − Rl

αl = αl−1

Tl−1
Tl−2 − Rl−1

7

The size of the giant component is even easier to derive. Let α∞ =
4. This is the probability that a connection goes to a node at
liml→∞ αl
distance inﬁnity from the seed, or in other words is outside of the giant com-
ponent. The probability that a degree k node is outside the giant component
is then αk
∞. Following similar reasoning as above we ﬁnd the size of the giant
component to be

ngc = n(1 − g(α∞))

(8)

As we move outward from our seed, we ﬁnd that the degree distribution
changes within each layer of the network. Initially the average degree tends to
increase, as nodes are connected to with probability proportional to degree.
But quickly high degree nodes are exhausted, and the average degree within
a layer decreases sharply.

In the l’th layer the probability of a node being degree k given by

pk;l =

l−1 − αk

(10)

(11)

where c is the appropriate normalizing constant for the degree distribution.
When α is close to zero, it dominates the above expression, and thus the
distribution converges to a power law as we move away from the seed. Of
course, if pk decays faster than a power law (e.g. exponentially) then the
distribution will theoretically not have the “fat tails” characteristic of power-
laws for large k. This happens regardless of the degree distribution of the
network as a whole.

Using identical reasoning as we used to determine the number of nodes in
layer l, we can determine the generating function for the degree distribution
in layer l.

gl(x) =

g(αl−1x) − g(αlx)
g(αl−1) − g(αl)

(12)

Note that g(αl−1)−g(αl) is in the denominator to normalize the distribution.
4It is interesting to note that α∞ corresponds to the probability of a connection not
being to the giant component, u, as derived by Newman et al. in [13]. The way that this
quantity is computed is somewhat diﬀerent.

8

The degree distribution outside of the giant component is similarly easy

to derive:

And the degree distribution within the giant component is the complement:

An important sociological consideration is the mean path length and the
associated closeness centrality statistic [29, 23]. Having chosen a seed, we
can compute the average distance to other nodes in the network using the
quantities calculated above:

ggcc(x) =

g(α∞x)
g(α∞)

ggc(x) =

g(x) − g(α∞x)
1 − g(α∞)

mc =

l × nl
ngc

X
l≥1

(13)

(14)

(15)

This can be considered the expected closeness centrality of a degree z0 node
in the network, where z0 is the degree of our seed.

3 Theoretical Examples

The reader may ﬁnd it helpful if we illustrate the preceding ideas with a few
simple, idealized examples.

Many social networks fall into one of two regimes. The simplest case
is for the degree distribution to be relatively homogeneous, as occurs when
individuals connect to one another with uniform probability. This leads to
the classical random networks such as those studied by Rapaport and Erd˝os.
These are characterized by a symmetric, unimodal distribution, namely the
Poisson generated by equation 2. In the second regime, we ﬁnd that a minor-
ity of individuals act as “hubs” for the network, thereby accounting for the
great majority of connections in the network [2]. This leads to highly skewed
degree distributions such as power-laws and simple exponentials. Although
highly idealized, both of these simple cases may have something to teach us
about the structure of real social networks.

We have explored both Poisson and Exponential networks using simula-
tion and the tomographic methods discussed above. Consider the Poisson
degree distribution, with generating function 2. Let n = 50000.

9

By combining equations 2 and 11 we ﬁnd that the degree distribution in

layer l is generated by

ez(αl−1x−1) − ez(αlx−1)
gl(x) =
ez(αl−1−1) − ez(αl−1)
= ezαl−1(x−1) 1 − ezαl−1x(γl−1)
1 − ezαl−1(γl−1)

(16)

(17)

where γl = Tl/(Tl + Sl − Rl).

It can be veriﬁed that this satisﬁes the requirements for a probability
generating function, namely that it has a series expansion, and that gl(1) = 1.
Figure 2 shows the degree distribution for z = 3 at various layers. The solid
lines represent the theoretical solutions given by 11, and the points, where
present, mark the results of simulation. 40 networks of size n = 50000 and
with Poisson degree distribution, z = 3 were generated. For each network
20 seeds were chosen independently, and the network was mapped out from
each. Averaging these simulations yield the data points shown.

Furthermore we can explore how the network changes its structure as the
mean of the degree distribution, z, is swept over a range of values. Figure 3
shows the results of one simulation where z = 1.25, 3, 5 and n = 50000 as
before. The average number of nodes at various distances from a randomly
chosen seed is shown. Dotted lines represent the results of simulations, while
the solid lines represent the theoretical prediction. The dotted line above the
theoretical prediction shows the 90’th percentile among simulations. Likewise
It can be seen that our

theory correctly captures the trend as we increase z from 1.25 to 5.

The theoretical prediction for ﬁgure 3 is derived by solving our generating

function 2 and using 7. We ﬁnd:

nl = nez(αl−1−1)(1 − ezαl−1(γl−1))

(18)

where γl = Tl/(Tl + Sl − Rl).

Figures 4 and 5 show identical experiments for the exponential degree
distribution 3. The mathematics is somewhat more tedious for this case, so
we omit it here.

Now viewing the results for the exponential and Poisson experiments,
several things bear mention. As we observed above, the degree distribution
converges to a skewed exponential or power-law as we move to higher layers
in the network. This occurs despite the homogeneous degree distribution of

of these distributions for high layers. However, we observe the “fat-tails” of
power laws instead. This is most likely a ﬁnite-size eﬀect.

tion for the exponential random networks has its mode shifted rightward of
0 in the ﬁrst several layers, thus making its distribution more reminiscent
of the Poisson. This is yet another consequence of the existence of hubs in
these networks; the higher mode bulge in these distribution represents the
existence of higher degree hubs a short distance from v0.

4 Email Network

The ideas presented here can be illustrated with a real social network. The
network shown in ﬁgure 6 is the giant component for a one-day sample of
email traﬃc for individuals at Cornell University. This includes a diverse
collection of faculty, researchers, students and administrators. The commu-
nication linking them is correspondingly diverse, motivated by work, research
and social aﬃliation.

In communication networks such as these, it is very important to develop
a sense of tie-strength between individuals, particularly for email networks,
as a great deal of communication does not indicate a meaningful relationship,
but merely the spread of cheap information (i.e. “spam”). Fortunately, there
is an easy way to distinguish genuine social aﬃliation from simple information
transfer. If persons in the network exchange emails in both directions within
the 24 hour sampling frame, that is a strong indication that the conversants
are well-acquainted and socially connected. We can then induce a subnetwork
by including only those ties which are reciprocal.

In what follows, two networks will be considered. The ﬁrst is the raw
communication network, with no distinction made between reciprocal and
non-reciprocal communication. For convenience, this will be referred to
as the R/NR network. This network consists of 14216 nodes with 25040
connections. The giant component of the network occupies 13577 of the
nodes (95.5%).

The second network consists only of reciprocal email connections and the
nodes which have such connections. This will be called the R network. This
network is much smaller, consisting of only 2607 nodes with 4838 connections.
The giant component occupies 1227 nodes (47.1%).

The degree distributions for both the R and R/NR networks are shown
in ﬁgure 7. Both distributions are evidently power laws, as they lie approx-
imately on a straight line with log/log axes. The solid lines show a ﬁt to
these data of a power law density with exponential cutoﬀ:

, k ≥ 1

(19)

(20)

where Lin(x) is the nth polylogarithm of x. To apply the tomographic theory,
we need the generating function for this density. This is given by

g(x) = Liγ(xe−1/κ)/Liγ(e−1/κ).

When applying the tomographic theory, it is possible to use the empirical
degree distribution, but as the theoretical distributions appear to ﬁt the em-
pirical power laws very well, we will use the theoretical distributions instead.

R/NR network. The theory matches observations fairly well for the R/NR
network. A very diﬀerent situation is illustrated by ﬁgure 9, which shows
the theoretical stratum sizes (solid line) alongside the mean stratum size
for the R network (dotted line). There is clearly a great deviation between
theory and observation. Nevertheless, this diﬀerence is instructive. The R
network shows only strong ties, in contrast to the R/NR network which con-
tains both strong and weak ties. Consequently, there are many more social
micro-structures in the R network than would be expected in a pure random
network. The clustering coeﬃcient 5 , a measure of network transitivity, is
much greater for the R network (C = 7.4%) than for the R/NR network
(C = 1.86%). Of course, in a pure random network of these sizes, C ≈ 0.
Micro-structures such as these contribute to the deviations seen in ﬁgure 9
because they push the social network away from the pure random regime on
which the network tomographic theory is based. As shown in [27], clustering
has the eﬀect of increasing mean path length and decreasing the giant com-

5 Discussion

The methods discussed here have relevance for disparate areas of networks
research.

Consider the problem of network sampling– the utilization of social net-
works for surveying a population. Lately methods of chain-referral sampling
have been proposed [9, 28] which model chain-referral samples as random
walks on social networks.
In general, little is known about the attributes
of individuals reached after n steps of such a random walk. Tomographic
methods may open a new window on the problem. We can now compute the
expected properties of a node at a given distance from our starting point, as
well as the probability that a random walk will be at that distance after a
given number of steps. This allows us to answer questions such as

• How many diﬀerent nodes could possibly be reached after n steps?

• What is the probability of the n’th node in a chain referral sample

19

having degree k?

after n steps?

• What is the probability of being at distance l from our starting point

It is beyond the scope of this paper to provide answers to these questions,
but it is certainly possible using network tomography.

Another potential application is to the study of network diﬀusion– the
study of dynamical processes which spread through a population via network
connections. Examples include the adoption of innovations [26, 22] as well
as the spread of information or rumors [7, 31]. The {nl} curves shown above
are highly reminiscent of birth and death processes such as the spread of an
epidemic through a population of susceptible individuals. In fact, the way we
have mapped out our network from a single node is somewhat like the way
an infectious agent may spread through a population from an initial infected.
Previous research [12] has investigated the structural properties of diﬀusion
of this sort, e.g. the proportion of the network that is ultimately occupied by
infecteds. But it has been diﬃcult to place a timescale on diﬀusion without
resorting to computer simulation. It is hoped that progress will soon be made
with the application of network tomography to these and related problems.
All of these results must be taken with the caveat that real networks may
not be organized as simple random networks. As mentioned above, there is
no guarantee that a real social network will exhibit the same sequences of nl
or pk;l as in the random regime. Extra forces can shape the network topology
and push these statistics away from the pure random regime. These statistics
can be thought of as something that help characterize the structure of the
network, like a ﬁngerprint of its structure. When the statistics deviate from
the random regime, it is an indication that unique and potentially interesting
forces are aﬀecting the network.

A simple example is furnished by the potential existence of greater than
random transitivity(i.e. triadic closure), which can certainly aﬀect the num-
ber of nodes at a given distance from our seed as well as the degree dis-
tribution at that distance [27]. However, with more study it may even be
possible to adapt the tomographic method to account for transitivity and
other non-random structures within social networks.

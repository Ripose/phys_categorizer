INTRODUCTION

A renewed interest in studying the distribution of income has emerged over the last

years in both the physics and economics communities [1]. The focus has been mostly put

on empirical analysis of extensive data sets to infer the exact shape of personal income

distributions, and to design theoretical models that can reproduce them [2].

A natural starting point in this area of enquiry was the observation that the number

of persons in a population whose incomes exceed x is often well approximated by Cx−α,

for some real C and some positive α, as Pareto [3] argued over 100 years ago. However,

theoretical and empirical work rapidly pointed out the fact that it is only in the upper tail

of the income distribution that a Pareto-like behavior can be expected [4], while the bulk of

the income—held by the 95% or so of the population—is governed by a completely diﬀerent

law. Therefore, many recent papers within this literature have sought to characterize the

distribution of income by a mixture of known statistical distributions, even if there is a dis-

pute about what these distributions are: indeed, while it seems to be generally acknowledged

that the top 1–5% of incomes follows the Pareto’s law, an exact and unequivocal character-

ization of the low to medium income region of the distribution is still evasive. For example,

Refs.

[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] claim that this is lognormal, while according to Refs.

[14, 15, 16, 17, 18] the distribution of personal income for the majority of the population

should follow the exponential law.

In the present work we address the issue of data analysis related to the size distribution of

income by adopting a statistical mechanics approach recently introduced in Refs. [19, 20, 21],

based on the one-parameter generalization of the exponential function deﬁned through

expκ (x) =

√1 + κ2x2 + κx

Along these lines, we are able to describe the whole range of the distribution with a single

function, ranging from the low region to the middle region, and up to the power-law tail,

pointing in this way toward an uniﬁed approach of the problem.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we introduce the κ-generalized statistical

distribution and describe its main properties. In Sec. III, in order to asses the reliability of

the proposed new statistical distribution, we compare the theoretical curve with the census

data for personal income in Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom. Finally, in Sec. IV

some concluding remarks are reported.

II. THE κ-GENERALIZED STATISTICAL DISTRIBUTION

The κ-generalized Complementary Cumulative Distribution Function (CCDF) is given

by

P> (x) = expκ (

βxα) ,

−

R+,

x

∈

(II.4)

being P> (x) the probability of ﬁnding the distribution variable with a value X greater than

x. The income variable x is deﬁned as x = z/

z

, being z the absolute personal income and

i
its mean value. Then the dimensionless variable x represents the personal income in

h

z

z

. The constant β > 0 is a characteristic scale, since its value determines the scale

i

h
units of

h

i

of the probability distribution: if β is large, then the distribution will be more concentrated;

if β is small, then it will be more spread out (see FIG. 1(a)–(b)). The exponent α > 0

quantiﬁes the curvature (shape) of the distribution, which is less (more) pronounced for

lower (higher) values of the parameter, as seen in FIG. 2(a)–(b). Finally, as one can observe

in FIG. 3(a)–(b), the deformation parameter κ

[0, 1) measures the fatness of the upper

∈

tail: the larger (smaller) its magnitude, the fatter (thinner) the tail.

The function (II.4) reduces to the ordinary stretched exponential one [22] as κ

0,

III. AN APPLICATION TO PERSONAL INCOME DATA

As a working example, we analyze the census data on personal income in three countries:

Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom.1

The data used are drawn primarily from the Cross-National Equivalent File (CNEF)

1980–2002, a commercially available data set compiled by researchers at Cornell University

which attempts to make comparable, among others, the following panel surveys: the German
Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) and the British Household Panel Study (BHPS).2 The

income variable we use is the post-government income, representing the combined income

after taxes and government transfers of the head, partner, and other family members.

1 See Refs. [5, 6, 24] for analysis referring to the same countries and data sources.
2 For background on the CNEF, see Ref. [25] or consult the CNEF homepage at the following web address:

http://www.human.cornell.edu/che/PAM/Research/Centers-Programs/German-Panel/Cross-National-Equivalent-

6

For Italy, which is not part of the CNEF, we use the Survey on Household Income and

Wealth (SHIW), a household-based panel study carried out by the Bank of Italy since 1977.

In place of the post-government income in the CNEF, we use the net disposable income

variable from the survey above—i.e., the income recorded after the payment of taxes and

social security contributions, deﬁned as the sum of four main components: compensation

of employees, pensions and net transfers, net income from self-employment, and property
income.3

The results obtained by ﬁtting our theoretical model through the observational data are
reported in TABLE I and FIGS. 4, 5, and 6.4 Panel (a) of the ﬁgures shows the empirical
cumulative distribution estimate5 of x along with three diﬀerent curves in the log-log scale:

the κ-generalized distribution, Eq.

(II.4); the ordinary stretched exponential (Weibull)

distribution, Eq.
In panel (b), the
histogram of the reconstructed probability density6 is contrasted to the theoretical curves

(II.5); the pure power-law distribution, Eq.

(II.6).

corresponding to Eqs.

(II.7) and (II.8) with the same parameter values as in TABLE I

and FIGS. 4(a), 5(a), and 6(a). It is clear that the κ-generalized distribution oﬀers a great

potential for describing the data over their whole range, from the low to medium income

region through to the high income Pareto power-law regime, including the intermediate

4 To ﬁnd the parameter values that give the most desirable ﬁt, we have used the Maximum Likelihood
(ML) estimation method. The overall set of best-ﬁt MLE parameters has been located by means of a grid
search of the parameter space, with optimization of the log-likelihood function starting from each grid
point and using the Nelder-Mead simplex search algorithm [27] as implemented in MATLAB r(cid:13) 7. We
have then calculated the approximate 95% conﬁdence level around each parameter by using the normal
approximation

IV. FINAL REMARKS

Since the early study of Pareto, numerous recent empirical works have all shown that

the power-law tail is an ubiquitous feature of income distributions. However, even 100 years

after Pareto’s observation, the understanding of the shape of income distribution is still far

to be complete and deﬁnitive. This reﬂects the fact that there are two distributions, one for

the rich, following the Pareto’s law, and one for the vast majority of people, which appears

to be governed by a completely diﬀerent law.

In the present work we have aﬃrmed support for a new ﬁtting function, having its roots

in the framework of κ-generalized statistical mechanics, which shows to be able to describe

the data over the entire range, including even the power-law tail. This distribution has a

bulk very close to the stretched exponential one—which is recovered when the deformation

parameter κ approaches to zero—while its tail decays following a power-law for high values

of income, thus providing a kind of compromise between the two description.

The good concordance of our generalized statistical distribution with observational data

on personal income may suggest a new path for investigating economic relations, namely

the development of models within the framework of κ-generalized statistical mechanics.

current year British pounds. (a) Plot of the empirical CCDF versus income in the log-log scale. The

solid line is our theoretical model given by Eq. (II.4) with κ = 0.6854

0.0001, α = 2.7243

0.0014,

±

±

and β = 0.7544

0.0003, which ﬁts very well the data in the whole range from the low to the high

±

incomes including the intermediate income region. This function is compared with the ordinary

stretched exponential one (dotted line)—ﬁtting the low income data—and with the pure power-law

(dashed line)—ﬁtting the high income data—by using the same parameter values. (b) Histogram

plot of the empirical PDF with superimposed ﬁts of the κ-generalized (solid line) and stretched

exponential (dotted line) PDFs using the same parameter values as in panel (a). The income axis

limits have been adjusted according to the range of data to shed light on the intermediate region

between the bulk and the tail of the distribution

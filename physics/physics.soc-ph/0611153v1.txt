Abstract

We investigate the network model of community by Watts, Dodds and
Newman (D. J. Watts et al., Science 296 (2002) 1302) as a hierarchy
of groups, each of 5 individuals. A clustering parameter α controls the
probability proportional to exp(−αx) of selection of neighbours against
distance x. The network nodes are endowed with spin-like variables si =
±1, with Ising interaction J > 0. The Glauber dynamics is used to
investigate the order-disorder transition. The ordering temperature Tc is
calculated from the relaxation time of the average value of spins, which
is set initially to one. Tc is close to 3.3 for α < 1.0 and it falls down
to zero above this value. The result provides a mathematical illustration
of the social ability to a collective action via weak ties, as discussed by
Granovetter in 1973.

Introduction

To investigate the human society is more than necessary. However, the subject
is probably the most complex system we can imagine, whatever the deﬁnition of
complexity could be. A cooperation between the sociology and other sciences -
including the statistical physics - can be fruitful for our understanding of what
is going around us. The science of social networks seems to be a rewarding ﬁeld
for this activity [1, 2, 3]. Although the physicists were not inventors of the basic
ideas here, their empirical experience can be useful at least for the mathematical
modelling in social sciences. Moreover, it seems that purely physical concepts
as a phase transition can provide a parallel and complementary description of
phenomena observed by the sociologists. Such a description is also a motivation
of this research. Our aim is to investigate the social ability to organize, as a
function of the topology of a network of social ties.

As it was stated by Granovetter [4] more than thirty years ago, the structure
of social ties can be a formal determinant in an explanation of the activity of a
given community. Granovetter wrote: ”Imagine (...) a community completely
partitioned into cliques, such that each person is tied to every other in his clique
and to none outside. Community organization would be severely inhibited.”

([4], p. 1373). As an example, the author provides ”the Italian community of
Boston’s West End (...) unable to even form an organization to ﬁght against the
urban revolution which ultimately destroyed it.” Granovetter argued, that new
information is transported mainly via distant connections (weak ties) between
the groups, and not within the group.

This compact description of a clusterized social structure found recently a
mathematical realization [5]. There, the level of clusterization (or cliqueness)
was controlled along the following receipt. Initially, the community is divided
into N/g small groups of g individuals i = 1, ..., N , represented by nodes of
the network, and the social ties - by links. The distance xij between the group
members are set hierarchically, as x = 1 between the nodes in the same group,
x = 2 between the members of neighbouring groups, x = 4 between the members
of groups which form neighbouring groups and so on. A schematic view is shown
in Fig. 1. These distances are not real, but virtual; however, real links are
determined on their basis. Namely, for each node i its links to other nodes j
are drawn randomly, with the probability of a distance between two nodes i
and j dependent on the distance xij as pij ∝ exp(−αxij ). The procedure is
repeated until a given number of neigbours z = g − 1 on average is assured.
In Ref.
[5], the nodes were connected according to a set of a few of mutually
intertwinned hierarchies. Here we follow the original picture [4], where only one
hierarchy is present. The topology of the network is controlled by the parameter
α. For α = − ln(2) every node is selected with the same probability [5], then the
system is just a random graph. (For a short introduction of these graphs see for
example [6]; for a numerical example see Fig. 2). For α large and positive, the
links drawn reproduce the initial virtual separation of the community to small
groups. For α large and negative, far nodes are connected more likely.

Here we add one more ingredient to the model. A spin si is assigned to each
node, and an interaction energy - to each link. The energy J is the same for each
link, and it favors the same sign of neighbouring nodes. In this way the social
system is translated into a magnet with the topology close to the one suggested
by Granovetter. As with a magnet, we can ask if a phase transition is possible [7]
where the spins order below some level of thermal noise to have mostly the same
orientation. This phase transition, if it is present in the magnetic system, serves
here as a parallel to measure the ability of the social system to a collective action.
Oppositely, a lack of the transition can be interpreted as an indication that the
network cannot behave in a coordinated way. Using this model, we do not
state that the magnetic interaction is in any sense similar to the interpersonal

interaction. We only assume, that an inﬂuence of the topology of the social ties
on the social collectivity can be reproduced to some extent by the inﬂuence of
the network topology on a collective state, with the latter measured by a scalar
spin variable.

2 Calculations and results

The simulation was carried out for a network of N = 640, 2560, 10240 and
20480 nodes, g = 5.
In the initial conﬁguration, all spins are set to be +1.
The relaxation time τ is determined by ﬁtting the time dependence of the total
magnetization M (t)

to the curve

For each value of α, the thermal dependence of the relaxation time τ is ﬁtted
in turn to the relation

what allows to determine Tc. The ﬁtting curve for various values of N are shown
in Fig. 3, and for various α – in Fig. 4.

Our main result - the transition temperature Tc as a function of the clustering
factor α - is shown in Fig. 5. The ordered phase appears exclusively for α < αc,
which is about 1.0. Above this value, Tc goes down to zero, what means that
the ordered phase does not exist.

3 Discussion

Assuming that the interpretation of the phase transition is sociologically mean-
ingful, we can state that our numerical result agrees with the qualitative pre-
diction of Granovetter, made in 1973. As long as the connections between the
small groups are too sparse, the system as a whole does not show any collec-
tive behaviour. We note that the number of the ties does not vary with the
clustering parameter α. It is only the tie distribution what changes the system
behaviour. Obviously, we have no arguments to support particular elements of
the model, as the number of states of one node (which is two), or the homoge-
neous character of the node-node interaction (the same for each tie), or the tie
symmetry (the same in both direction) etc. All these model ingredients should
be treated as particular and they can vary from one approach to another. On
the contrary, as we deduce from the universality hypothesis, the phase transi-
tion itself does depend on the number of components of the order parameter [8].
The assumption on the Ising model is nontrivial, but remains arbitrary. The
argument is that the model is the simplest known. It would be of interest to
check our results for more sophisticated descriptions of the social interactions,
as the models of Sznajd [9], Deﬀuant [10] or Krause-Hegselmann [11].

Concluding, it is not the critical value αc ≈ 1.0 of the clustering parameter
what is relevant for the sociological interpretation, because this critical value
depends on all the above mentioned details. What is - or can be - of importance

is that this critical value exists. The task, how to model a collective state
in a social system, remains open. We can imagine, that an exceeding of a
critical value of some payout, common for a given community, could trigger
oﬀ a collective action, enhanced then by a mutual interaction. Attempts of this
kind of description, with the application of the mean ﬁeld theory, are classical in
sociophysics [12]. The result of the present work assures, that the eﬀectiveness
of such a social interaction depends on the topology of the social network. The
same approach can be applied to other models of the social structure, as [13, 14].

In this letter, we propose a new routing strategy with a single free parameter α only based on local
information of network topology. In order to maximize the packets handling capacity of underlying
structure that can be measured by the critical point of continuous phase transition from free ﬂow to
congestion, the optimal value of α is sought out. By investigating the distributions of queue length
on each node in free state, we give an explanation why the delivering capacity of the network can
be enhanced by choosing the optimal α. Furthermore, dynamic properties right after the critical
point are also studied.
Interestingly, it is found that although the system enters the congestion
state, it still possesses partial delivering capability which do not depend on α. This phenomenon
suggests that the capacity of the network can be enhanced by increasing the forwarding ability of
small important nodes which bear severe congestion.

Since the seminal work on the small-world phe-
nomenon by Watts and Strogatz [1] and scale-free net-
works by Barab´asi and Albert [2], the evolution mech-
anism of the structure and the dynamics on the net-
works have recently generated a lot of interests among
physics community [3, 4]. One of the ultimate goals of
the current studies on complex networks is to under-
stand and explain the workings of systems built upon
them[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], and relatively, how the dynamics
aﬀect the network topology[11, 12, 13, 14]. We focus on
the traﬃc dynamics upon complex networks, which can
be applied everywhere, especially the vehicle ﬂow prob-
lem on networks of roads and the information ﬂow dy-
namic on interconnection computer networks. Some pre-
vious works have focused on ﬁnding the optimal strate-
gies for searching target on the scale-free networks [15]
and others have investigated the dynamics of information
ﬂow with respect to the packets handling capacity of the
communication networks [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22], how-
ever, few of which incorporate these two parts. In this
letter, we address a new routing strategy based on the
local information in order to both minimize the packets
delivering time and maximize the capacity of huge com-
munication networks.

In order to obtained the shortest path between any pair
of nodes, one has to know the whole network structure
completely. However, due to the huge size of the mod-
ern communication networks and continuous growth and
variance of the networks’ structure, it is usually an im-
possible task. Even though the network is invariant, for
the sake of routing packet along the shortest path each
node has to put all the shortest paths between any pair of
nodes into its routing table, which is also impractical for
huge size because of limited storage capacity. Therefore,
In contrast to previous works allowing the data pack-

ets forwarding along the shortest path, in our model, we
assume each node only has the topology knowledge of
it’s neighbors. For simplicity, we treat all nodes as both
hosts and routers for generating and delivering packets.
The node capacity, that is the number of data packets a
node can forward to other nodes each time step, is also
assumed to be a constant for simplicity. In this letter,
we set C = 10.

Recent studies indicate that many communication net-
works such as Internet and WWW are not homogeneous
like random and regular networks, but heterogeneous
with degree distribution following the power-law distri-
bution P (k) ∼ k−γ. Barab´asi and Albert proposed a
simple and famous model (BA for short) called scale-free
networks [2] of which the degree distribution are in good
accordance with real observation of communication net-
works. Here we use BA model with m = 5 and network
size N = 1000 ﬁxed for simulation. Our model is de-

scribed as follows: at each time step, there are R packets
generated in the system, with randomly chosen sources
and destinations, and all nodes can deliver at most C
packets toward their destinations. To navigate packets,
each node performs a local search among its neighbors.
If the packet’s destination is found within the searched
area, it is delivered directly to its target, otherwise, it is
forwarded to a neighbor node according to the preferen-
tial probability of each node:

Πi =

kα
i
Pj kα
j

,

(1)

where the sum runs over the neighbors of node i and
α is an adjustable parameter. Once the packet arrives
at its destination, it will be removed from the system.
We should also note that the queue length of each node
is assumed to be unlimited and the FIFO (ﬁrst in ﬁrst
out) discipline is applied at each queue [20]. Another
important rule called path iteration avoidance (PIA) is
that a path between a pair of nodes can not be visited
more than twice by the same packet. Without this rule
the capacity of the network is very low due to many times
of unnecessary visiting of the same links by the same
packets, which does not exist in the real traﬃc systems.
One of the most interesting properties of traﬃc system
is the packets handling and delivering capacity of the
whole network. As a remark, it is diﬀerent between the
capacity of network and nodes. The capacity of each node
is set to be constant, otherwise the capacity of the entire
network is measured by the critical generating rate Rc at
which a continuous phase transition will occur from free
state to congestion. The free state refers to the balance
between created packets and removed packets at the same
time. While if the system enters the jam state, it means
the continuous packets accumulating in the system and
ﬁnally few packets can reach their destinations. In order

to describe the critical point accurately, we use the order
parameter[17]:

η(R) = lim
t→∞

C
R

h∆Npi
∆t

,

(2)

where ∆Np = N (t+ ∆t)− N (t) with h· · · i indicates aver-
age over time windows of width ∆t and Np(t) represents
the number of data packets within the networks at time
t. For R < Rc, h∆N i = 0 and η = 0, indicating that
the system is in the free state with no traﬃc congestion.
Otherwise for R > Rc, η → ∞, the system will collapse
ultimately. As shown in Fig. 1, the order parameter
versus generating rate R by choosing diﬀerent value of
parameter α is reported. It is easy to ﬁnd that the ca-
pacity of the system is not the same with variance of α,
thus, a natural question is addressed: what is the optimal
value of α for maximizing the network’s capacity? Simu-
lation results demonstrate that the optimal performance
of the system corresponds to α ≈ −1. Compared to pre-
vious work by Kim et al. [15], one of the best strategies
is PRF corresponding to our strategy with α = 1. By
adopting this strategy a packet can reach its target node
most rapidly without considering the capacity of the net-
work. This result may be very useful for search engine
such as google, but for traﬃc systems the factor of traf-
ﬁc jam can not be neglected. Actually, average time of
the packets spending on the network can also be reﬂected
by system capacity. It will indeed reduce the network’s
capacity if packets spend much time before arriving at
their destinations. Therefore, choosing the optimal value
of α = −1 can not only maximize the capacity of the
system but also minimize the average delivering time of
packets in our model.

To better understand why α = −1 is the optimal
choice, we also investigate the distribution of queue
length on each node with diﬀerent α in the stable state.

FIG. 5: The evolution of Np for R > Rc. Here, αc takes −1.5
corresponding to the critical point Rc = 39.

Fig. 3 shows that when α ≥ 0, the queue length of the
network follows the power-law distribution which indi-
cates the highly heterogenous traﬃc on each node. Some
nodes with large degree bear severe traﬃc congestion
while few packets pass through the others and the het-
erogenous behavior is more obviously correspondent to
the slope reduction with α increase from zero. But due
to the same delivering capacity of all nodes, this phe-
nomenon will undoubtedly do harm to the system be-
cause of the severe overburden of small numbers of nodes.
In contrast to Fig. 3, Fig. 4 shows better condition of the
networks with queue length approximately displays the
Poisson distribution which represents the homogenous of
each node like the degree distribution of random graph.
From this aspect, we ﬁnd that the capacity of the system

with α < 0 is larger than that with α > 0. But it’s not
the whole story, in fact, the system’s capacity is not only
determined by the capacity of each node, but also by the
actual path length of each packet from its source to des-
tination. Supposing that if all packets bypass the large
degree nodes, it will also cause the ineﬃcient routing for
ignoring the important eﬀect of hub nodes on scale-free
networks. By the competition of these two factors, the
nontrivial value α = −1 is obtained with the maximal
network’s capacity.

The behavior in jam state is also interesting for allevi-
ating traﬃc congestion. Fig. 5 displays the evolution of
Np(t) i.e. the number of packets within the network with
distinct R. α is ﬁxed to be −1.5 and Rc for α = −1.5
is 39. All the curves in this ﬁgure can be approximately
separated into two ranges. The starting section shows
the superposition of all curves which can be explained
by the fact that few packets reach their destinations in a
short time so that the increasing velocity of Np is equal
to R. Then after transient time, Np turns to be a linear
function of t. Contrary to our intuition, the slope of each
line is not R − Rc. We investigate the increasing speed
of Np with variance of R by choosing diﬀerent parame-
ter α. In Fig. 6(a), in the congestion state Np increases
linearly with the increment of R. Surprisingly, after x
axis is rescaled to be R − Rc, three curves approximately
collapse to a single line with the slope ≈ 0.7 in Fig. 6(b).
On one hand, this result indicates that in the jam state
and R is not so large, the dynamics of the system do not
depend on α. On the other hand the slope less than 1
reveals that not all the R − Rc packets are accumulated
per step in the network, but about 30 percent packets
do not pass through any congested nodes, thus they can
reach their destination without contribution to the net-

work congestion. This point also shows that when R is
not too large in the congestion state, the congested nodes
in the network only take the minority, while most other
nodes can still work. Therefore, the congestion of the sys-
tem can be alleviated just by enhancing the processing
capacity of a small number of heavily congested nodes.
Furthermore, we study the variance of critical point Rc
aﬀected by the link density of BA network. As shown
in Fig. 7, increasing of m obviously enhances the capac-

ity of BA network measured by Rc due to the fact that
with high link density, packets can more easily ﬁnd their
target nodes.

Motivated by the problem of traﬃc congestion in large
communication networks, we have introduced a new rout-
ing strategy only based on local information. Inﬂuenced
by two factors of each node’s capacity and navigation
eﬃciency of packets, the optimal parameter α = −1 is
obtained with maximizing the whole system’s capacity.
Dynamic behavior such as increasing velocity of Np in the
jam state shows the universal properties which do not de-
pend on α. In addition, the property that scale-free net-
work with occurrence of congestion still possesses partial
delivering ability suggests that only improving process-
ing ability of the minority of heavily congested nodes can
obviously enhance the capacity of the system. The vari-
ance of critical value Rc with the increasing of m is also
discussed. Our study may be useful for designing com-
munication protocols for large scale-free communication
networks due to the local information the strategy only
based on and the simplicity for application. The results
of current work also shed some light on alleviating the
congestion of modern technological networks.

Abstract

We develop a two-dimensional cellular automaton (CA) as a simple
model for agents moving from origins to destinations. Each agent
moves towards an empty neighbor site corresponding to the minimal
distance to its destination. The stochasticity or noise (p) is introduced
in the model dynamics, through the uncertainty in estimating the
distance from the destination. The friction parameter ”µ” is also
introduced to control the probability that the movement of all agents
involved to the same site (conﬂict) is denied at one time step. This
model displays two states; namely the freely moving and the jamming
state. If µ is large and p is low, the system is in the jamming state
even if the density is low. However, if µ is large and p is high, a freely
moving state takes place whenever the density is low. The cluster size
and the travel time distributions in the two states are studied in detail.
We ﬁnd that only very small clusters are present in the freely moving
state while the jamming state displays a bimodal distribution. At low
densities, agents can take a very long time to reach their destinations
if µ is large and p is low (jamming state); but long travel times are
suppressed if p becomes large (freely moving state).

1 Introduction

Cellular Automata (CA) micro-simulation has emerged as a tool for simulat-
ing traﬃc ﬂow and modelling transport networks [1, 2, 3]. In CA, time and
space are discrete. The space is represented as a uniform lattice of cells with
ﬁnite number of states, subject to a uniform set of rules, which drives the
behavior of the system. These rules compute the state of a particular cell as
a function of its previous state and the state of the neighboring cells.
Agents moving from origins to destinations across networks may represent
several real entities, as for example: ants, biological organisms, small robots,
transport in micro-mechanical systems, crowd ﬂow, packets transport in the
Internet, etc....
It was found that the motion of the biological organisms
is usually controlled by interactions with other organisms in their neighbor-
hood and randomness also plays an important role [4]. Real ants have been
shown to be able to ﬁnd shortest paths towards destinations using as only
information the pheromone trail deposited by other ants [5]. The ﬁnding of
shortest paths, inspired from ants’ behavior, are successfully applied to sev-
eral physical problems such as, pedestrians [6, 7], traﬃc ﬂow [8], combinato-
rial optimization [9] and circuit switched communications network problems
[10]. The problems of movement of agents with origins and destinations were
studied using a two dimensional cellular automata [8, 11]. In these models an
agent tries to reach its destination using simple rules. Transitions from the
freely moving to the jamming states were studied. A variant 2-dimensional
CA model for simulation of agents moving from origins to destinations will
be presented here. Agents moving across the network have sensors to per-
ceive their local neighborhood and their destinations and then aﬀect their
environment. This is done especially by estimating the distance metric to
the destination site. The concern herein will be with the movement, prop-
agation, and interaction of agents in low and high density situations. This
will be done by exploring the patterns and behaviors of the spatio-temporal
organization of agents. The objective of this research is to provide insight
into modelling complex dynamics using CA microsimulation and capturing
general features of agents travelling from origins to destinations. The paper
is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, we describe our model for movements of
agents with origins and destinations. In Sec. 3, we present our numerical
results where we give the phase diagrams of the system. A detailed descrip-
tion of the cluster size and the travel time distributions are also presented.
Finally, we conclude with some conclusions in Sec. 4.

2 The cellular automata model

The CA model is a two-dimensional cellular automaton based on a square
lattice with periodic boundary conditions. There is a ﬁxed number of agents
on the lattice at all times. Only one agent at most can occupy a given site.
At any time step, an agent can move at most to one of its 4 neighboring sites.
Updating of the CA occurs in parallel where the rules are applied to all agents
at the same time. Agents are associated with given origin-destination sites.
The origin and destination sites must be diﬀerent. An agent travels from
the origin site towards its destination site, whereupon it disappears. Each
disappeared agent is immediately replaced by a new agent, and so the agent
number is always constant in the lattice. A new origin-destination pair is
then chosen randomly for this new agent. If, however, there is an agent al-
ready present at the chosen origin, then another origin site is selected.
Agents will move towards their destinations at all times by selecting an un-
occupied neighboring site which has the minimal distance from that site to
the destination site (see ﬁgure 1). An agent examines the unoccupied neigh-
boring sites. For each of these sites a distance to the destination is evaluated.
Then, a site with the minimal distance is selected as the next site to which
the agent will move. If all neighboring sites are occupied it will not move.
The stochasticity or noise is introduced in the model dynamics, through the
uncertainty in estimating the distance from the destination. So, with prob-
ability p an agent moves towards an arbitrary empty neighboring site rather
than the site of minimal distance. The friction parameter µ is also introduced
to control the probability that the movement of all agents involved to the
same site (conﬂict) is denied at one time step. This friction parameter which
is essential for resolving the conﬂict arising in parallel update simulations, is
applied for pedestrian traﬃc problems [12, 13].
In each time step, positions, speeds and directions of all agents are updated
according to the following local rules:
- with probability p, an agent selects one arbitrary empty neighboring site.
- with probability (1 −p) agent selects an empty neighboring site correspond-
ing to the minimal distance to the destination. If two empty neighboring sites
of one agent have the same minimal distance from the destination then one
of these two allowed neighbors is chosen randomly.
If two or more agents select the same site (conﬂicts) then:
- with probability µ none of the agents is allowed to move to their selected
site.

3

- with probability (1 − µ) one of these agents is chosen randomly to move to
its selected site; the others agents do not move.
If there exist no conﬂict, the agent moves to its selected site. If all neighbor-
ing sites are occupied, the agent does not move.

3 Simulation experiments and results

We carry out our computer simulations of the model by considering a square
lattice of size L with periodic boundary conditions. Initially, we put randomly
a number N of agents into the lattice. The density of agents is denoted as
ρ = N/L2. The velocity of each agent can be either 1 or 0. The duration of
each simulation run is 50, 000 time steps with the ﬁrst 20, 000 time steps to
initiate the simulation and the latter 30, 000 used to generate performance
statistics. Agents are only allowed to move to unoccupied nearest neighbor
sites in one time step, i.e. vmax = 1 cell/time step.

3.1 Diagrams of agents speed versus density

In ﬁgure 2, we carried out the plots of the mean velocity of agents as a
function of the density, for several system size. Hence, the plots show that
hvi undergoes a sudden phase transition from a freely moving state hvi ≈ 1
to jammed state hvi ≈ 0 at a critical density ρc. In the freely moving state,
interaction between agents is weak and the propagation is important inside
the network. In contrast, for large density, the interaction becomes strong
and jamming takes place where agent movements become rare. As regards
the variation with system size L, we ﬁnd that the critical density decreases
with increasing L and the phase transition becomes sharper.
In ﬁgure 3, we plot hvi as a function of µ for diﬀerent values of p and ρ. Hence,
for low density, the average speed remains almost constant if the probability p
is high. However, if p is low, hvi undergoes a sudden decrease when µ exceeds
a critical value µc. This corresponds to a phase transition from the freely
moving state to the jamming state. Consequently, the enhancement of the
friction parameter can topple over from the freely moving to the jamming of
agents even at low densities. At high densities, hvi decreases gradually with
µ for all values of p. Yet, the speed hvi remains always greater for larger p.
The phase diagrams of the system is depicted in ﬁgure 4, where we plotted
the critical values µc as a function of p for several ﬁxed values of ρ. Thus,

4

for low densities and for a given value of p, freely moving phase should exist
if µ < µc while jamming phase takes place if µ > µc.
It was shown also
from ﬁgure 4 that the jamming region is broaden as soon as the density is
increased. Yet, when the density exceeds some value ρ > 0.6, the freely
moving phase should never exist.

3.2 Spatio-temporal organizations of agents

It is clear that the density dependence of speed alone, cannot give the whole
information on the phase behavior of the system. To get more information
on the microscopic structure of the phases, one can determine the spatio-
temporal organization of agents in the lattice. This microscopic investiga-
tions can be obtained by plotting the organization patterns of agents and the
distributions of cluster sizes and travel times. The cluster and the cluster size
mean here a connected bonds of unoccupied cells and a maximally number
connected cells of agents respectively. The travel time is the time it would
take to travel from the origin to destination.

3.2.1 Self-organization patterns of agents

Figures 5(a-b) show a typical conﬁgurations of the organization of agents at
low density. So, for vanished value of p and for low values of µ, the steady
state corresponds to the freely moving. However if µ is high, agents self-
organize in a large cluster with few freely moving agents at the boundary.
For higher values of p, the freely moving phase should exist even for larger
µ. Hence, it seems that the role of µ is to pile up the agents into one large
cluster while p tends to dispatch them in all directions.
For high densities and low p, agents pile up into one large cluster even if µ
is vanished (Fig. 5c). In the other side, this agglomeration splits up into
several clusters when p becomes large (Fig. 5d).

3.2.2 Cluster size distributions

The cluster size distributions of the model are given in ﬁgures 6(a-b). At
low density and for vanished value of p, only small clusters are present in
the lattice whenever µ is low. This is one characteristic of the freely moving
phase. From results depicted in ﬁgure 6a, we observe the bimodal nature
of the cluster size distribution as µ increases. Large clusters appear in the

5

lattice but there are by far many more small-sized clusters than larger ones.
Furthermore, with increasing µ, the probability of small clusters diminished
while that of large cluster increases. Another important result is the dis-
continuity observed from the probability distribution when µ becomes very
large. As it was shown from ﬁgure 5b, almost all agents are congested in
one large cluster with the exception of a few agents which are located at the
boundary and moving towards their destinations. From ﬁgure 6a (ρ = 0.1
and p = 0), one can see a phase transition from the freely moving phase to
the jamming phase, occurring at µc ≈ 0.8. Indeed, when µ < µc, the cluster
size distribution is a continuous function; but it becomes discontinuous when
µ > µc. This value of µc agree with that found in the phase diagram (Fig.
In the other hand, when p is large enough, we see that large clusters

cannot exist even for large µ. It is important to note also that the increase of
p increases the probability of small-sized clusters (see ﬁgure 6b, higher part).
At high densities, it is not surprising that large clusters may be usually
present in the lattice. However, their sizes depend greatly to the parameter
p. For example, the most probable cluster size (of large clusters) is shifted
towards the low size region (Fig. 6b, lower part). In contrast to p, the eﬀect
of µ on the cluster size distribution is negligible (result not shown). If the
density is high, only a small value of µ may provoke a strong congestion of
agents.

3.2.3 Travel time distributions

The second quantity we look at is the travel time, i.e. the time an agent needs
to travel from its origin to its destination. The probability distribution of the
travel time presents a maximum which is considered as the most probable
time, at which an agent ﬁnished its travel. At low density and for low p,
the distribution is sharply peaked around its maximum, whenever µ is zero
(Fig. 7a). If p increases, one ﬁnds evidently a broad distribution of travel
time, because agents are moving for quite long times before reaching their
destinations. The higher is p, the higher is the travel time.
As regards the variation of µ, ﬁgure 7b illustrates some graphs of the travel
time distributions for low densities and when we set p = 0. The interesting
observed phenomena is the existence of a double asymptotic behavior. So,
when µ is not large enough, we see that inﬁnite travel time cannot exist.
In contrast, for large µ, some agent may take an inﬁnite time to reach its
In this case, the agents situated in the interior of the large

cluster do not move and rest inside for an indeﬁnite time. When p is large
enough and the density is low, the travel time distribution changes slightly
if µ is changed (Fig. 7b). Furthermore, we see that inﬁnite travel time does
not occur even for very large µ. This shows again that the state is the freely
moving one at low density and for large p.
For higher densities, the short travel times still remain, showing the presence
of some agents situated at the boundary of a large cluster but the asymptotic
behavior is rather increasingly wide; reﬂecting the dynamics of agents inside
the large clusters (see ﬁgure 7a, lower part). Indeed, in the presence of large
clusters one has to distinguish between inner and outer regions of the cluster.
Inside, one ﬁnds evidently a broad distribution of travel times, because agents
are blocked for quite long times. In the outer region of a cluster, however,
one ﬁnds shorter travel times. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that inﬁnite travel time
exist even for large p, because the capacity of the freely moving is reduced
when there was a big crowd of agents (congestion).

4 Conclusions

In summary, we have tried to identify the behavioral aspects of agents trav-
elling from origins to destinations. The microscopic CA model presented is
capable of capturing the self-organization and complex dynamics of agents.
The model contains two parameters (µ,p) and displays two states; namely
the freely moving and the jamming state. The agents speed hvi depends
strongly to the parameters (µ,p). For low densities, phase transitions occur
as the friction parameter µ exceeds a critical value µc, which depends on
both the density ρ and the noise p.
In the other hand, it was found that the eﬀect of µ is to gather diﬀerent
agents into a large cluster. This leads to jamming even at low density. How-
ever, the eﬀect of p is to disperse agents through the lattice. Thus, more
mobility and ﬂuidity will aﬀect the whole system. When distinguished for
diﬀerent density ranges, cluster size and travel time distributions have in-
teresting properties. Indeed, if ρ and p are low, a transition from the freely
moving to the jamming states can occur at a critical value µc. Thus, when
µ < µc agents self-organized in small clusters and only short travel times can
be taken by agents. However, in the other side (µ > µc), agents self-organize
in one large cluster with very small number of moving agents at the bound-
ary. This is the jamming state where the travel time can be either short

7

and long. So, short travel times concern agents at the boundary of the large
cluster while the long times concern those in the inner of the cluster.
At high densities, jamming occurs for all values of (µ,p). This is due to the
reduction of the capacity of a freely moving when there was a big crowd of
agents in the lattice. As a result, the speed show a drastic decrease with the
density. The cluster size distribution becomes a bimodal distribution which
represents a coexistence of large clusters and small ones. Yet, the travel time
distribution is much broad where inﬁnite travel time exists for all values of
the system parameters (µ,p).

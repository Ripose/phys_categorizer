Abstract. – We introduce a model for innovation-, evolution- and opinion dynamics whose
spreading is dictated by unanimity rules, i.e. a node will change its (binary) state only if
all of its neighbours have the same corresponding state. It is shown that a transition takes
place depending on the initial condition of the problem. In particular, a critical number of
initially activated nodes is needed so that the whole system gets activated in the long-time
limit. The inﬂuence of the degree distribution of the nodes is naturally taken into account. For
simple network topologies we solve the model analytically, the cases of random, small-world
and scale-free are studied in detail.

Introduction. –

In general, the discovery or emergence of something depends on the
combination of several parameters, all of them having to be simultaneously met. One may
think of economy, where the production of a good depends on the production or existence of
other goods (e.g. to produce a car one needs the wheel, the motor and some ﬁoritures). In
return, this new discovery opens new possibilities and needs that will lead to the production
of yet new goods (e.g. the simultaneous existence of the car and of alcohol directly leads to
the invention of the air bag). This auto-catalytic process is a very general process [1–4] and
obviously applies to many situations not only related to innovation, but also to evolution,
opinion formation, food chains etc. One may even think of the dynamics of scientiﬁc ideas,
music genres, or any other ﬁeld where the emergence of a new element possibly leads to new
combinations and new elements. This feedback is responsible for the potential explosion of
the number of items, such as observed e.g. in the Cambrian explosion). This ”explosion” has
been shown to be identical of a phase transition in a Van der Waals gas [1]. After mapping the
above catalytic reactions onto a network structure, where nodes represent items and directed
links show which items are necessary for the production of others, it is tempting to introduce
a unanimity rule (UR): a node on the network is activated only if all the nodes arriving to it
through a link are activated. Surprisingly, the dynamics of such an unanimity rule, that is a
straightforward generalization of the usual majority rules of opinion dynamics [5–9], is poorly

Fig. 1 – First two steps of UR starting from an initial network of 7 nodes, 2 of them being activated.
Initially there is only one node among the non-activated nodes that satisﬁes the unanimity rule. It
gets therefore activated at the ﬁrst time step. At that time, there is a new node whose 2 incoming
links come from activated nodes. It gets activated at the second time step. It is straightforward to
show that this system gets fully activated at the fourth time step.

known [1]. In this Letter, we are interested on the spreading dynamics of the UR and try to
understand which conditions have to be satisﬁed so that the network gets fully activated in
the long time limit.

Unanimity model. – The network is composed of N nodes related through directed links.
Each node exists in one of two states: activated or inactivated. The number of nodes with
indegree i (the indegree of a node is deﬁned to be the number of links arriving to it) is denoted
by Ni and depends on the underlying network structure. Initially (at t = 0) there are A0 nodes
which are activated, among which Ai,0 have an indegree i. In general, the number of nodes
of type i, activated at time t, is Ai,t. It is also useful to introduce the quantities ni = Ni
N and
ai,t = Ai,t
which are the proportions of nodes of type i in the network (indegree distribution)
Ni
and the probability that such a node i is activated, respectively. at = At
N = Pi niai,t is the
fraction of activated nodes in the whole network at time t. The unanimity rule is deﬁned as
follows (see Fig.1). At each time step, each node is considered. If all the links arriving to a
speciﬁc unactivated node i originate at nodes which are activated at t − 1, i gets activated
at t. Otherwise, it remains unactivated. The process is applied iteratively until the system
reaches a stationary state, characterized by an asymptotic value a∞. In the following, we are
interested in the relation between a∞ and a0, i.e. what is the ﬁnal occupation of the network
as a function of its initial occupation on a speciﬁc network. Let us mention the fact that
each node may be produced by only one combination of (potentially many, depending on the
indegree) nodes. This is a modiﬁcation of the model of Hanel et al. [1], where more than one
pairs of (two) nodes could produce new elements and will lead to a diﬀerent equation for the
activation evolution, as shown below. The dynamics studied here implies that nodes with a
higher indegree will be activated with a probability smaller than those with a smaller indegree
(because the former have more conditions to be fulﬁlled).

Master equation. – Let us now derive an evolution equation for Ai,t and At. To do
so it is helpful to consider the ﬁrst time step and than to iterate. There are initially A0
activated nodes, Ai,0 = A0Ni/N of them being of indegree i on average (the activated nodes
are randomly chosen in the beginning). The ensemble of Ai,0 nodes is called the initial set of
indegree i. By construction, the probability that i randomly chosen nodes are activated, is

Renaud Lambiotte, Stefan Thurner and Rudolf Hanel : Unanimity Rule on networks3

ai
0 (i is an exponent). Consequently, the average number of nodes with indegree i and who
respect the unanimity rule is Niai
0 while the number of such nodes that are not yet occupied
is

and, on average, the total number of occupied nodes with indegree i evolves as:

∆i,0 = (Ni − Nia0)ai
0,

Ai,1 = Ai,0 + ∆i,0.

Let us stress that we have implicitely assumed that there are no indegree correlations between
neighboring nodes in order to derive Eq.1. At the next time step, the average number of
nodes with indegree i, who respect the unanimity rule and who are outside the initial set is
(Ni − Nia0)ai
1. Among those nodes, ∆0,i have already been activated during the ﬁrst time
step, so that the average number of nodes who get activated at the second time step is:

∆i,1 = (Ni − Nia0)(ai

1 − ai

0).

Note that Eq.3 is valid because no node in ∆i,1 also belongs to ∆i,0. This is due to the fact
that each node can only be activated by one combination of i nodes in our model, so that no
redundancy is possible between ∆i,1 and ∆i,0. By proceeding similarly, it is straightforward
to show that the contributions ∆i,t read

with a−1 = 0 by convention. The number of activated nodes evolve as

By dividing by Ni, one gets a set of equations for the proportion of nodes ai ∈ [0, 1]:

∆i,t = (Ni − Nia0)(ai

t − ai

t−1),

Ai,t+1 = Ai,t + ∆i,t.

ai,t+1 = ai,t + (1 − a0)(ai

t − ai

t−1),

where the coupling between the diﬀerent proportions ai,t occurs through the average value
at = Pi niai,t, as deﬁned above. Finally, by multiplying by the indegree distribution ni and
summing over all values of i, one gets a closed equation for the average proportion of activated
nodes in the network that reads

at+1 = at + (1 − a0) X
i

ni(ai

t − ai

t−1).

Let us stress that Eq.7 is non-linear as soon as Ni 6= 0, i > 1. Moreover, it is characterized
by the non-trivial presence of the initial condition a0 in the right hand non-linear term and
is therefore highly non-local in time. Eq.7 explicitly shows how the indegree distribution ni,
aﬀects the propagation of activated nodes in the system.

Theoretical results. – In this section, we focus on simple choices of ni in order to appre-

hend analytically the behavior of Eq.7. The simplest case is n1 = 1 for which Eq.7 reads

at+1 = at + (1 − a0)(at − at−1).

This equation is solved by recurrence:

with the theoretical prediction 14. In the right ﬁgure, we plot the relation a∞(a0) that obviously
shows a transition at a0 = 1/2. Eq.14 is in perfect agreement with the numerical integration of Eq.12

The above solution implies that any initial condition converges toward the asymptotic state
a∞ = 1, i.e. whatever the initial condition, the system is fully activated in the long time limit.
The relaxation to a∞ = 1 is exponentially fast ∼ eln(1−a0)t.

Let us now focus on the more challenging case n2 = 1 where all the nodes have an indegree

of 2 by construction. In that case, Eq. 7 reads

at+1 = at + (1 − a0)(a2

t−1).

The non-linear term does not allow to ﬁnd a simple recurrence expression as above. Though,
a numerical integration of Eq.12 (by using Mathematica for instance) shows that the leading
terms in the Taylor expansion of at behave like

n2 = 0.27... In both ﬁgures, the total number of nodes is N = 10000 and the results are averaged over
100 realizations of the process. The solid lines are the corresponding numerical solutions of Eq.18,
evaluated with the empirical values ni.

This solution should satisfy the normalization constraint a∞ ≤ 1, so that it can hold only for
initial conditions a0 > 1/2. This argument suggest that a transition takes place at ac = 1/2,
such that only a fraction of the whole system gets activated when a0 < ac while the whole
system activates above this value (see Fig.2). We verify the approximate solution Eq.14 by
looking for a solution of the form at = a0
1−a0 (1 + ǫt). By insterting this expression into Eq.12,
one gets the recurrence relations:

ǫt+1 = ǫt + a0(1 + ǫt)2 − a0(1 + ǫt−1)2
ǫt+1 = ǫt + 2a0(ǫt − ǫt−1),

where the second line is obtained by keeping only ﬁrst order corrections in ǫ. In the continuous
time limit, keeping terms until the second time derivative, one obtains

(1 − 2a0)∂tǫt + 1/2(1 + 2a0)∂2

t ǫt = 0,

whose exponential solutions read ǫt = e−λt with

This is a relaxation to the stationary state a∞ only when a0 < 1/2, thereby conﬁrming a
qualitative change at ac = 1/2.

Some network topologies. – Let us now focus on more reasonable topologies and compare
the results obtained from Eq. 7 with numerical simulations of the UR. We focus on three types
of networks, purely random networks [10], small-world like networks [11] and Barabasi-Albert
networks [12] (growing networks with preferential attachment). The excellent agreement with
Eq. 7 suggest that the formalism should apply to more general situations as well. The
random network was obtained by randomly assigning L directed links over N nodes. The
small-world network was obtained by starting from a directed ring conﬁguration and than

randomly assigning L directed links (short-cuts) over the nodes, i.e. the total number of links
in that case is L + N (The network drawn in Fig.1 is such network with N = 7 nodes and
L = 3 short-cuts). Let us note that the small-world network can be viewed as a food chain
with a well-deﬁned hierarchy between species together with some random short-cuts. In that
case, UR can be interpreted as an extinction model (if all the species that one species eats
go extinct, this species will also go extinct). The Barabasi-Albert network was built starting
from one seed node and adding nodes one at a time until the system is composed of N nodes.
At each step, the node ﬁrst connects to a randomly chosen node and, with probability p, it
re-directs its link to the father of selected node. This method is well-known to be equivalent
to preferential attachment and to lead to the formation of fat tail degree distributions kν,
with ν = 1 + 1/p, [13].

Once the underlying network is built, we randomly assign a0N active nodes to the network
and apply the unanimity rule. The evolution stops once a stationary state is reached. The
asymptotic value a∞ is averaged over several realizations of the process (on several realizations

incoming link. This is not the case for the random- or the BA networks, for which one has to
discuss the ambiguous dynamics of nodes with zero incoming links. Two choices are possible.
Either these nodes can not be activated in the course of time, because they are not reached
by any other node (No Zero version), or all of them are get activated at the ﬁrst time step,
thereby assuming that their activation does not require any ﬁrst knowledge (Zero version). The
choise is a question of interpretation. The two versions are associated to diﬀerent evolution

and leads to quite diﬀerent behaviors (Figs.3 and 4). In the case of small-world networks, the

above equations are obviously equivalent. To compare the simulation results with Eq.18, we
also measure the indegree distributions of the networks ni generated during the simulations
and integrate Eq.18 with these empirical values. The agreement is excellent, except close
to the transition points where ﬁnite size eﬀects are expected.
It is worth noting that the
importance of nodes with zero incoming links is much higher in (growing) Barabasi-Albert
like networks (Fig.4), so that the diﬀerence between the two versions is quite pronounced, as
expected. Let us also mention that Eq.14 has been successfully veriﬁed for a random network
where the indegree of each node is exactly 2 (n2 = 1), as shown in Fig.2.

Discussion. –

In this Letter, we have introduced a simple model for innovation whose
dynamics is based on Unanimity Rule. It is shown that the discovery of new items on the
underlying network opens perspectives for the discovery of new items. This feedback eﬀect
may lead to complex spreading properties, embodied by the existence of a critical size for the
initial activation, that is necessary for the complete activation of the network in the long time
limit. The problem has been analyzed empirically on a large variety of network structures and
has been successfully described by recurrence relations for the average activation. Let us stress
that these recurrence relations have a quite atypical form, due to their explicit dependence
on the initial conditions. Moreover, their non-linearity makes them a hard problem to solve
in general. Finally, let us insist on the fact that Unanmity Rule is a general mechanism
that should apply to numerous situations related to innovation, opinion dynamics or even
species/population dynamics. To be consistent with our own work, we also hope that this
paper will trigger the reader’s curiosity and, possibly, open new perspectives or research
directions...

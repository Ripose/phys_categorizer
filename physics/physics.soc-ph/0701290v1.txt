The so-called rich-club phenomenon in a complex network is characterized when nodes of higher
degree (hubs) are better connected among themselves than are nodes with smaller degree. The
presence of the rich-club phenomenon may be an indicator of several interesting high-level network
properties, such as tolerance to hub failures. Here we investigate the existence of the rich-club
phenomenon across the hierarchical degrees of a number of real-world networks. Our simulations
reveal that the phenomenon may appear in some hierarchies but not in others and, moreover, that it
may appear and disappear as we move across hierarchies. This reveals the interesting possibility of
non-monotonic behavior of the phenomenon; the possible implications of our ﬁndings are discussed.

INTRODUCTION

The so-called rich-club phenomenon in complex net-
works is characterized when the hubs (i.e. nodes with
high degrees) are on average more intensely intercon-
nected than the nodes with smaller degrees. More pre-
cisely, it happens when the nodes with degree larger than
k tend to be more densely connected among themselves
than the nodes with degree smaller than k, for some
signiﬁcant range of degrees in the network [1]. This is
quantiﬁed by computing the so-called rich-club coeﬃcient
across a range of k-values. The name “rich-club” arises
from the analogy that hubs are “rich” because they have
high degrees, and when the phenomenon is present, they
form “clubs” because they are well-connected among
themselves.

The relevance of the rich-club phenomenon is that its
presence or absence typically reveals important high-level
semantic aspects of a complex network. For example, its
presence in the scientiﬁc collaboration network of a given
research area reveals that the particularly famous and in-
ﬂuential scientists in that ﬁeld are frequently co-authors
with many other inﬂuential scientists in the same ﬁeld.
Similarly, the absence of the rich-club phenomenon in a
protein-protein interaction dataset possibly reveals that
proteins with large connectivity are presiding over diﬀer-
ent functions and are thus possibly coordinating distinct
and speciﬁc functional modules [2]. The presence of the
phenomenon in a power-grid network may indicate the
robustness or stability of the network against blackouts,
since several neighboring hubs would be available to aid
a faulty hub in the case of an emergency.

Given a speciﬁc network node i, it is possible to deﬁne
its successive neighborhoods, i.e. the set of nodes which
are at shortest distance of 1, 2, and so forth, from the
reference node i (e.g. [3, 4, 5, 6]). Recently, a series of
hierarchical measurements have been proposed and in-
vestigated for the characterization of the structure of a
complex network [6, 7, 8]. These involve the deﬁnition of
the hierarchical degree, expressing the connectivity be-
tween the successive hierarchical neighborhoods centered

at each network node. Such a formalism is useful since
it not only progressively extends the locality of the node
degree but also has the ability to reveal patterns asso-
ciated with the indirect relations in a network, i.e. the
so-called virtual links among nodes [6].

In this letter we investigate the behavior of the rich-
club coeﬃcient across diﬀerent hierarchies of a complex
network as the means to obtain more global extensions of
that coeﬃcient. We study in particular a power grid net-
work, a scientiﬁc collaboration network, and a protein-
protein interaction network. Our results reveal a variety
of diﬀerent behaviors for the rich-club phenomenon. The
presence of the phenomenon may depend on the hierar-
chy, and we even report a non-monotonic behavior for
one of the networks, in which the phenomenon appears
and disappears as we progress over the hierarchies.

II. THE RICH-CLUB PHENOMENON

Consider a graph G = (V, E) representing a complex
network. Let V>k be the set of vertices with degree larger
than k, N>k be the number of such vertices and E>k be
the number of edges among such vertices. The so-called
rich-club coeﬃcient is given by

φ(k) =

2E>k
N>k(N>k − 1)

,

(1)

i.e. the fraction between the actual and the potential
number of edges among V>k [1].

This measure clearly reﬂects how densely connected
the vertices V>k are. One could at ﬁrst think that the
rich-club phenomenon would apply if φ(k) were an in-
creasing function of k, i.e. if vertices with large degree
were more densely connected among themselves than ver-
tices with low degree. This was indeed assumed in [1],
where the increasing dependency of φ(k) on k was called
the “rich-club phenomenon”. However, one must notice
that vertices with higher degree will be naturally more
likely to be more densely connected than vertices with
smaller degree simply due to the fact that they have more

incident edges. As a result, for a proper evaluation of this
phenomenon we must normalize out this factor. This
point was raised in [2], who derived an analytical expres-
sion for the rich-club coeﬃcient of uncorrelated large-size
networks at high degrees

φunc(k)

k,kmax→∞

and claimed that it should be used to ﬁnd a normalized
rich-club coeﬃcient, ρunc(k) = φ(k)/φunc(k). φunc(k) is
however not properly deﬁned in some cases, such as for
heavy-tailed distributions [2]. In practice then the nor-
malization factor is obtained by generating a randomized
version of the network with the same degree distribu-
tion. A simple algorithm [9] to achieve this consists in
ﬂipping the endpoints of two random edges and iterat-
ing: at each iteration the degrees of the four nodes in-
volved will remain the same but the edge structure will
If suﬃciently many iterations are carried out,
change.
the ﬁnal network will be in some sense a random net-
work, but with the same degree distribution as the ini-
tial network. We then compute the rich-club coeﬃcient
for the resulting “maximally random network”, φran(k),
and use it for ﬁnding the normalized rich-club coeﬃcient,
ρran(k) = φ(k)/φran(k). As a result, while ρunc(k) gives
the rich-club coeﬃcient with respect to an ideal uncor-
related graph, ρran(k) is a realistic normalized measure
that takes into account the structure and ﬁniteness of
the network. In our simulations we compute ρran(k) for
real-world complex networks across a range of values of
k but also across the hierarchy of networks derived from
the original one [6].

III. COMPLEX NETWORK HIERARCHIES

Given a node i, the other nodes which are at shortest
path of length h from i constitute the hth hierarchical
level of that node. For a speciﬁc hierarchical level h de-
ﬁned by a node i, the number of nodes between this level
and the next level (i.e. the hierarchical level h + 1) is
deﬁned as the hierarchical degree of node i [6, 7, 8]. Be-
cause of the ﬁnite size and diameter of the network, the
hierarchical node degree tends to increase up to a peak
and then decrease as the network is progressively encom-
passed by the higher hierarchies. Therefore, the maxi-
mum hierarchical level which can be considered for the
hierarchical node degree is equal to the network diame-
ter, i.e. the longest length of the shortest path among
any two nodes in the network. The hierarchical node
degree provides a natural means for gradually express-
ing more global aspects of the connectivity around each
node. In other words, while the traditional node degree
is an exclusively local measurement, the hierarchical de-
gree at successive levels provides information also about
the medium to global scales of the network.

IV. EXPERIMENTS

2

We have set up a series of experiments on several com-
plex network datasets. The ﬁrst is related to the power-
grid of the western states of the United States of America
[10]. We also investigated a scientiﬁc collaboration net-
work from the great area of Condensed Matter Physics
[2], and a protein-protein interaction network of the yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae [11] (these data sets are avail-
able at [12, 13, 14], respectively). We have computed
the normalized rich-club coeﬃcient across the hierarchi-
cal degrees of the network for the ﬁrst 4 hierarchies. Fig-
ure 1 shows the results we obtained. In each graph, the
vertical axis corresponds to the (normalized) rich-club
coeﬃcient, while the horizontal axis corresponds to the
hierarchical degree (plotted up to the degree of the largest
hub in the corresponding hierarchy). The rich-club phe-
nomenon is characterized by an increasing dependency of
the normalized rich-club coeﬃcient on the degree of the
network. For the power grid network, the phenomenon
is present with signiﬁcant strength for all hierarchies.
For the scientiﬁc collaboration network, the phenomenon
appears for the ﬁrst order and progressively attenuates
along further levels. Finally, the protein-protein interac-
tion network reveals a particularly interesting behavior:
the phenomenon is absent for the ﬁrst order, appears
with strength in the second order and disappears again
along the higher orders. This non-monotonic behavior
of the rich-club phenomenon across hierarchies is a non-
trivial fact that can provide valuable information about
the overall structure of the network.

V. DISCUSSION

For the power-grid network, the presence of the rich-
club phenomenon reveals that hubs are highly connected
and thus presumably there is more stability in the sense
that the duties of faulty hubs may be more easily taken
over by neighboring hubs (since there are many of them).
The presence of the phenomenon across all hierarchies
might reveal the fact that such stability is veriﬁed across
a range of scales of the network, suggesting higher re-
silience. For example, connections among neighbor-
hoods, cities and counties may all exhibit a certain degree
of stability. In the scientiﬁc collaboration network, the
phenomenon is present for the ﬁrst order as expected,
indicating that renowned scientists in a given ﬁeld are
likely to have been co-authors in at least one paper. How-
ever, as we move across hierarchies, the strength of the
phenomenon is progressively dissipated. This may be in-
terpreted as follows: for higher hierarchies, progressively
diﬀerent scientiﬁc sub-communities are being considered
and in this case it is unlikely that great scientists from
diﬀerent sub-areas have been co-authors in at least one
paper. Finally, we have the results for the protein-protein
interaction network. The absence of the phenomenon for
a given hierarchy of this network might indicate that at

this hierarchy key proteins are specialized and preside
over diﬀerent groups of proteins. The malfunction of a
protein will then in general be critical. On the other
hand, the presence of the phenomenon may indicate that
key proteins act in concert, what suggests a certain de-
gree of stability in the activities for which they are re-
sponsible. The non-monotonicity observed then implies
that diﬀerent patterns of specialization are characteris-
tic of speciﬁc hierarchies instead of being a progressive
feature over hierarchies. For this network, the ﬁrst order
reveals a high degree of specialization of the proteins,
the second order reveals much less specialization, and
the higher orders suggest a more neutral regime. This is
a particularly interesting ﬁnding because it reveals that
patterns of stability or specialization may alternate as the
scale from which an organism is observed is varied. An
interesting question to be further pursued would then be

4

the investigation of whether such varying patterns of sig-
natures of specialization or stability/resilience would cor-
relate with data or prior knowledge of, say, sub-systems
of the human body which present varying degrees of re-
silience to malfunction or disease. Our results possibly
suggest that over-specialization or perhaps even instabil-
ity of sub-systems of an organism does not necessarily
imply instability of the organism in a global scale.

(Received September 27, 2013)

Globalization has progressed and all of the world markets are synchronized to a few developed
markets. We focus on the eﬀect of globalization on the Korean market, one of the emerging markets.
Some characteristics of the Korean market are diﬀerent from those of the mature market according
to the latest market data, and this is due to the inﬂuence of foreign markets or investors. In this
paper, we investigate the market network structures over the past two decades with knowledge of the
history of the market, and determine the globalization eﬀect and market integration as a function
of time.

I.

INTRODUCTION

‘The world to Seoul, Seoul to the world.’ This was the
slogan of the 1988 Seoul Olympics Games, and is also the
slogan of the Korean stock market. Globalization means
that foreign traders have an inﬂuence on the Korean mar-
ket and its synchronization with world markets.

Interdisciplinary study has received much attention,
with considerable interest in applying physics to eco-
nomics and ﬁnances [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Since a ﬁnancial
market is a complex system, many researchers use net-
work theory to analyze such systems. The concept of
an asset tree constructed by a minimum spanning tree is
useful in investigating market properties [6, 7, 8]. The
minimum spanning tree (MST) is derived for a unique
sub-network from a fully connected network of the corre-
lation matrix. The MST of N nodes has N −1 links; each
node represents a company or a stock and edges with the
most important correlations are selected. Then clusters
of companies can be identiﬁed. The clusters, a subset of
the asset tree, can be extended to portfolio optimization
in practice. The companies of the US stock market are
clearly clustered into business sectors or industry cate-
gories [9].

Nowadays, many emerging markets experience global-
ization. This globalization is making rapid progress and
the inﬂuence of developed markets is becoming stronger.
Most markets synchronize with the US market and glob-
alization is leading to characteristic changes in emerging
markets [10].

Several results have been reported on the necessity
to ﬁnd a model appropriate to emerging markets, be-
cause the models for mature markets cannot be applied
to emerging markets universally [11]. The Korean market
is representative of emerging markets and is subject to
synchronization with external markets [12, 13, 14, 15, 16].
Clustering in the Korean market diﬀers from that in the
US market and is due to foreign factors [17].

In this paper, we explore characteristics of the Ko-
rean stock market. We construct the minimum spanning
tree shifting a time window of approximately two decades

and analyze the time-dependent properties of the clusters
in the MST. The market conditions are not stationary.
Then we investigate the market with knowledge of the
history of the Korean market.

II. DYNAMICS OF THE MARKET

The Korea Stock Exchange (KSE) opened in 1956. At
that time, only 12 companies were listed on the market.
As the Korean economy developed, the stock market un-
derwent many changes under the inﬂuence of factors in-
side and outside the market.

We deal with the daily closure stock prices for compa-
nies listed on the KSE from 4 January 1980 to 30 May
2003. The stock had a total of 6648 price quotes over
the period. We select 228 companies that remained in
the market over this period of 23 years. Fig. 1 shows
the index for those companies. The representative KSE
index, KOSPI, is an index of the value-weighted average
of current stock prices. The index of Fig. 1 is a price-
equally-weighted index such as that used for the Dow
Jones industrial average (DJIA). Many previous studies
on the stock market assumed a certain number of trad-
ing days to constitute a year. However, it is not easy to
apply such an assumption to our data set, because the
Korean market opening time changed in 2000. Before 20
May 2000, the market opened every day except Sunday,
and from Monday to Friday after 21 May 2000. Most of
data set falls into the former period, so we assume 300
trading days a year. The x-axis values in Fig. 1 were
calculated under this assumption.

We use the logarithmic return of stock i, which can be

written as:

Si(t) = ln Yi(t + ∆t) − ln Yi(t),

(1)

where Yi(t) is the price of stock i. The cross-correlation
coeﬃcients between stock i and j are deﬁned as:

λij =

q(< S2

< SiSj > − < Si >< Sj >
i > − < Si >2)(< S2

j > − < Sj >2)

coeﬃcients, with correlations among them also apparent
[9]. However, crash eﬀects on the Korean market (the

sis) are visible, but not clear in comparison with the US
market, and the Korean market coeﬃcients do not have
clear correlations.

We investigate more properties of the market through
the MST. The MST is a simple graph with N nodes and
N − 1 links. The most important connection is linked
when it is constructed. It is known that the US market
network is centralized to a few nodes [19]. The hub of the
US market is approximately General Electric (GE) and it
is possible to make clusters (subsets of the MST) of the
US market’s MST with industry categories or business
sectors [9]. However, the Korean market has no com-
parable hub for the whole market, and the clusters are
constructed with the MSCI index [17]. We regard this
result as the eﬀect of globalization and market integra-
tion.

Thus, we obtained the MSTs from 1980 to 2003 with
time windows of width T corresponding to daily data
for T =900 days and δT =20 days. During this period
there is no comparable hub, but we can form clusters with
industry categories for some periods. Then we deﬁne the

parameter grouping coeﬃcient. The grouping coeﬃcient
of a speciﬁed industry category C is deﬁned as:

where i∈C represents the nodes in category C, n(i) is the
number of links that are connected to node i and nC is
the number of links from the node included in category
C.

Table I shows 25 industry categories of the Korean
stock market. In fact, there are rather more categories
than 25. However, the standard for grouping is exces-
sively detailed, and combinations of these categories are
mostly used. The categories in Table I are reconstructed
from Hankyoreh, a popular newspaper in Korea.

Fig. 3a shows the grouping coeﬃcient for each cate-
gory over the whole period. We observe that categories
8, 18, 21, 22 and 23 form a well-deﬁned cluster. We focus
on the maximum grouping coeﬃcient for each industry
category. For example, there are only four companies in
the ﬁnance category (23) and the maximum value of the
coeﬃcient is only 0.6 (=3/5) because of the characteris-
tics of the MST. We take the maximum value when the
nodes are linked linearly. Fig. 3b shows the ratio of the
grouping coeﬃcient to the maximum value for each cat-
egory. Categories 18, 21, 22 and 23 are almost complete
clusters in this plot.

We previously investigated characteristics of the Ko-
rean stock market [17] using a data set from 2001 to
2004, and found that the market forms clusters when
the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) index
is exploited. However, Fig. 3 shows that some indus-
try categories can be applied to form the clusters. We
consider the history of the Korean market, including the
globalization eﬀect.

Fig. 4 shows the grouping coeﬃcient G for the whole
market as a function of time. This coeﬃcient is cal-
culated with all of the nodes, and the ratio of connec-
tions between companies in the same category to the to-
tal number of links. Before the mid-1980s, the Korean
market had developed according to a planned economy
and had many restrictions on trading of stocks. At that
time, the market was unstable because of poor liquidity.

This is one possible explanation for lower value in the
early 1980s in Fig. 4. As the market prospered in the
mid-1980s, clusters of industry categories also extensively
formed.

The 1988 Seoul Olympics Games and the 1997 Asian
ﬁnancial crisis hastened globalization of the Korean mar-
In particular, globalization of the Korean mar-
ket.
ket progressed to synchronization with external markets.
This explains the decreasing coeﬃcient in Fig. 4 after
1988. The index continues to show a decreasing trend,
which means that the formation of clusters in the Ko-
rean market is related to the MSCI index. The MSCI
Korea index has been calculated from 1988, when the
self-grouping coeﬃcient in Fig. 4 has almost a maximum
value. The MSCI Korea index is a factor of the Korean
market’s globalization and market integration. Because
foreign traders strongly inﬂuence the Korean market, the
MSCI index is a good reference for their trading [17].

III. CONCLUSIONS

We studied the Korean stock market network with the
daily closure stock price. The analysis shows that the
grouping coeﬃcient changes with elapsing time. With
globalization, the market is synchronized to external
markets, and the number of clusters of industry cate-
gories decreases. Finally, the market forms clusters ac-
cording to the MSCI index. We think the tendency of
synchronization will be stronger and the clusters of the
MSCI index or foreign factors will be ﬁrmer. Our future
research will determine other properties of the globaliza-
tion eﬀect with other statistical analysis in the Korean
market.

higher value than the other periods. The numbers refer to the category number in Table I.

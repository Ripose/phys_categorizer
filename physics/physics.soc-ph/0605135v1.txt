White ﬂight or ﬂight from poverty?

Abstract The phenomenon of White ﬂight is often illustrated by the case of Detroit whose popu-
lation dropped from 1.80 million to 0.95 million between 1950 and 2000 while at the same time its
Black and Hispanic component grew from 30% to 85%. But is this case really representative? The
present paper shows that the phenomenon of White ﬂight is in fact essentially a ﬂight from poverty.
As a conﬁrmation, we show that the changes in White or Black populations are highly correlated
which means that White ﬂight is always paralleled by Black ﬂight (and Hispanic ﬂight as well). This
broader interpretation of White ﬂight accounts not only for the case of northern cities such as Cincin-
nati, Cleveland or Detroit, but for all population changes at county level, provided the population
density is higher than a threshold of about 50 per square-kilometer which corresponds to moderately
urbanized areas (as can be found in states like Indiana or Virginia for instance).

1 Introduction

Many “theories” have been proposed to “explain” White ﬂight. One can mention for instance the
works of Castells (1983), Shelling (1971, 1978) or Smith (1987). However, as often occurs in the
social sciences, the theories were proposed almost independently of actual observations. Two reasons
may help to understand why observation lagged behind. First, in order to be meaningful, the study
of White ﬂight must be carried out at the level of counties or even the more detailed description level
of city-blocks. The fact that there are about 5,000 counties in the United States may explain why
before the Internet revolution data at county level were not easily available. The second difﬁculty
is the fact that one needs data for different population groups. The very deﬁnition of these groups
involves conceptual difﬁculties1. There are only few countries whose statistical yearbooks provide
data about population components. The United States is probably the country which publishes the
most detailed statistics in this respect. This is why the study of White ﬂight has largely been conﬁned
to this country. Probably the phenomenon also exists elsewhere as suggested by the few data which
are available for Toronto or London, but until more detailed data become available for other countries,
studies of White ﬂight will have to focus on the case of the United States.

The study proceeds in ﬁve steps.

1) First, by taking the speciﬁc example of the highly urbanized state of New Jersey we explain

how the phenomenon of White ﬂight can be estimated statistically.

2) Then, we show that the observations made for New Jersey can be extended to other states as

well provided one focuses on counties whose population density is above a given threshold.

3) We show that White ﬂight is almost as strongly correlated with poverty as with percentage of

minority populations.

4) As poverty is a notion which extends beyond ethnic division lines, it is natural to wonder
whether or not different populations groups have the same behavior with respect to poverty stricken
areas. The evidence shows that the migration pattern observed for white populations is in fact par-
alleled by similar patterns for Blacks or Hispanics. White ﬂight, Black ﬂight and Hispanic ﬂight go
hand in hand. Accordingly, White ﬂight appears a rather misleading denomination; a more appropri-
ate one would indeed be ﬂight from poverty.

5)

In the last section of the paper, we suggest that this broader interpretation of White ﬂight can
also account for the standard cases of White ﬂight observed in Cincinnati , Cleveland or Detroit in the
1950s and 1960s.

Before considering the phenomenon at county level it is natural to ask whether or not it exists at state
level. The answer is no. More precisely, if one estimates White ﬂight at state level by using the
statistical procedure that we use at county level, one ﬁnds a (non-signiﬁcant) correlation of -0.15 as
compared to correlations between -0.75 and -0.93 at county level. In other words, at state level the
effect is so weak that it is completely hidden by the “noise” due to other shocks and migration factors.

2 White ﬂight in New Jersey

New Jersey is a convenient laboratory for the study of White ﬂight because it is a highly urbanized
state with a large population. As we will see later on, population density is a crucial parameter in the
study of white ﬂight. The statistical procedure that we use in order to measure the intensity of White

1It must be emphasized that there can be no scientiﬁc deﬁnition of a White, Black or Hispanic person. Throughout this
paper, we rely on the statistical deﬁnition used by the U.S. Bureau of the Census which is based on a self-identiﬁcation
procedure. For the sake of brevity and uniformity, we use systematically the term “Black” in preference to other equivalent
terms such as “Afro-American or “colored”.

ﬂight is based on the following steps.
For each of the 21 counties of New Jersey we consider the following variables:

a) Total population in 1990: P
b) White non-Hispanic (WnH) population in 1990: W1
c) White non-Hispanic population in 1996: W2

From these population variables we compute two ratios that we express as percentages:

• Percentage of the population that is not WnH in 1990: x = 100(1 − W1/P )

• Relative percentage annual change in WnH population, 1990-1996: y = 100

(cid:18)

The resulting scatter plot is shown in Fig. 1. There is a strong relationship between x and y; the
coefﬁcient of correlation is −0.93 with a 95% likelihood conﬁdence interval (−0.97, −0.85) and the
slope of the regression line is: −0.68 ± 0.11. One may wonder if this result is speciﬁc to the time
interval under consideration. The answer is that fairly similar results hold for previous decades as
well: see Table 1.

percentage change in White population over one decade.
1990-1996: x2 = 100% − percentage of White non-Hispanic (WnH) population, y2 = Percentage change in
WnH population over one decade.
There are 21 counties in New Jersey; the scatter plot corresponding to the last time interval is shown in Fig. 1.
Prior to 1990, the data for white populations also include Hispanics (data for WnH were not available). This is
certainly why the last correlation is much higher than previous ones; indeed, if one replaces the “WnH” data by
“White” data the correlation drops from −0.93 to −0.29. In 1980 the Hispanic population represented 6.1% as
compared to 11% in 1996. The slopes a of the regression lines in the different time intervals were computed
on a 10-year basis for all the intervals including the last one which therefore had to be renormalized by a factor
10/6. The fact that a decreases in the course of time suggests that the White ﬂight effect has a tendency to
become weaker.

3 White ﬂight in other states than New Jersey

Is White ﬂight speciﬁc to New Jersey? That would of course seem surprising. As a matter of fact,
we ﬁnd a similar effect in other states as well. Table 2a summarizes some of the data. The slopes of
the regression lines are comprised between 0.13 and 0.52 (minus sign discarded) and their average is
equal to 0.30. In words, the relationship |∆y| = 0.30|∆x| means that, for instance, when in a given
county the percentage of the minorities increases from 20% to 40%, then2:

|∆x| = 20% =⇒ |∆y| = 6%

which means that the net change of the WnH population in this county shifts for instance from 8% to
2% (i.e. a slowdown in the increase) or from 3% to -3% (i.e. a shift from an inﬂow to an outﬂow).

Apparent exceptions In some cases there does not seem to be a clear relationship between x and
y. An example is provided by Fig. 2a which shows the scatter plot for Ohio. However, it can
be observed that the correlation increases when the scatter plot is restricted to the counties whose
population density is higher than a given threshold. This density effect is documented for several
states in Table 2b.
The table shows that the correlation is increased for almost all states. However, the level of signif-
icance is increased only for states which contain a substantial number of high density counties. A
corollary of this observation is the fact that White ﬂight effect cannot be observed for states such as
Arizona or New Mexico which have almost only low density counties.

2In order to give it a more intuitive meaning, the statement is made in terms of temporal changes, whereas Fig. 1 refers
to ensemble changes at county level. Although the equivalence of temporal and ensemble changes cannot be taken for
granted, that assumption is made here as a working hypothesis.

In all the cases listed the negative correlation is signiﬁcant. The regression slopes refer to the 6 year-long
interval 1990-1996; in order to make them comparable to the slopes for the decade-long intervals in table 1,
they must be multiplied by 10/6. For instance, the average would become 0.30 × (10/6) = 0.50.

4 Inﬂuence of poverty

What are the factors which rule domestic migrations in countries with an ethnically homogeneous
population? One would expect that economic opportunities are an essential factor. As two extreme
illustrations one can mention the gold rush toward Alaska after the discovery of gold in this region
or the move of Irish people from rural counties in Ireland toward the industrialized areas of Britain
during the crisis of the second half of the nineteenth century3. It is natural to assume that this effect
also exists in the Unites States. To test this hypothesis, we ﬁrst consider the case of New Jersey.
Fig. 3a is similar to Fig. 1 except that the x-axis variable in Fig. 1 has been replaced by the percentage
of the population below poverty as deﬁned by the Census Bureau4. The coefﬁcient of correlation is
−0.81 which conﬁrms that the poverty effect is almost as strong as the white ﬂight effect considered
in Fig. 1.

Generalization to other states Can the results for New Jersey be extended to other states? Table 3
compares the correlation c1 between changes in white population and minority percentage on the one
hand to the correlation c2 between the same changes in white population and percentage of population
below poverty on the other hand. All the c2 correlations are signiﬁcant with the exception of California
and Louisiana. The reasons behind these exceptions remain an open question. On average the c2
correlations are only 22% smaller than the c1 correlations.

3In the eyes of people of this time, the Irish were in fact considered as a separate population group. Their poverty,
drunkenness, red faces and miserable dwellings gave them an appearance akin to that of “savages” (in Tocqueville’s words
(1958)).

4The poverty index is based solely on money income and does not reﬂect non-cash beneﬁts such as food stamps,
Medicaid and public housing. The poverty threshold is updated every year to reﬂect changes in the Consumer Price Index
(Statistical Abstract of the United States 2005, p. 424).

Fig. 2a: White ﬂight in Ohio. Each number corresponds to one of the 88 counties (listed in alphabetical
order). In this graph the population density threshold is 0 which means that all counties are included. The x
and y variables are the same as in Fig. 1. The coefﬁcient of correlation is -0.49 (the 95% conﬁdence interval is:
(−0.63, −0.31) ). Source: same as in Fig. 1.

How are these two effects related? One can note that in the United States the income of Whites is
higher than the income of Black or Hispanic minorities. In 1990, the median income of Whites was
1.7 times higher than the median income of Blacks and 1.4 times higher than the median income
of Hispanics. Therefore one is not really surprised that the two effects seem to overlap. Naturally,
one would like to understand better the relationship between these two effects and whether one is a
consequence of the other. One way to explore this issue is to study the migrations of Black people.
For the case of New Jersey this is done in Fig. 3b. We see that there is a signiﬁcant Black ﬂight.
The correlation is −0.76 as compared to −0.93 in Fig. 1. As a matter of fact the two graphs are very
similar. It is of interest to observe more closely the counties at the two opposite ends of the horizontal
axis.

• The counties numbered 7 and 9 (i.e. Essex and Hudson respectively) have a high minority
percentage but also a high poverty percentage. As a result, Whites have been leaving these counties
at an annual rate of about 2.20%, whereas the Black population increased at an annual rate of only
0.28% as compared to 1.40% for the whole state of New Jersey. In short, there has been a White ﬂight
as well as a Black ﬂight away from Essex and Hudson counties5.

5In a general way, in the present study, we do not try to distinguish between the natural increase (due to the surplus
of births over deaths) and migration balance. If we try to do it here, broadly speaking, this can be done on the basis
that in New Jersey the annual natural increase 1990-1996 was 0.62% for the White population and 1.00% for the Black
population. This means that for the White population migrations represented −2.20% − 0.62% = −2.82%, whereas for

Fig. 2b: White ﬂight in Ohio.
In this graph the population density threshold is 100 people per square
kilometer; there are 20 counties which qualify. The x and y variables are the same as in Fig. 1. The coefﬁcient of
correlation is -0.74 (the 95% conﬁdence interval is: (−0.89, −0.46) ). It is fairly apparent that the relationship
between x and y is not linear but rather of the form: y = a ln x + b; indeed, the coefﬁcient of correlation of
ln x and y is −0.83 (conﬁdence interval= (−0.93, −0.62) ). Source: same as in Fig. 1.

• At the other end of the income spectrum, the counties numbered 18 and 19 (i.e. Somerset and
Sussex respectively) have a minority percentage of 10% and have less than 3% of their population
under poverty level. Their White component has been increasing at an annual rate of about one
percent and their Black component at an average rate of 3.5 %.

This suggests that the so-called White ﬂight is not speciﬁc to Whites but is shared by other com-
ponents of the population as well and that it has more to do with economic opportunities than with
interactions between different communities. Further insight can be gained by discussing in more de-
tail the case of West Virginia (mentioned in Table 3) which is of special interest. This state has few
minority people: 3.1% Blacks, 0.6% Hispanics and 0.5% Asians. Therefore, one would not expect
that the minorities are the force which drives the movements of the White population. This is indeed
conﬁrmed by the results in Table 3: the c1 correlation is only −0.28 with a 95% conﬁdence interval
(−0.51, −0.02) which shows that it is barely signiﬁcant. On the other hand, with an average below
poverty percentage of 20% (1990), West Virginia is one of the poorest American states. As a result,
one is not surprised that it is poverty which is the driving force of the movements of the WnH popu-
lation as conﬁrmed by a c2 correlation of −0.44 (i.e. 57% higher than the previous c1 correlation of

the Black population they represented 0.28% − 1.00% = −0.72%. The ﬁgures show that there was indeed a Black ﬂight
which paralleled the White ﬂight.

Notes: For the sake of eliminating negative signs, all numbers have been replaced by their opposites. The two
columns labeled “Corr” give the coefﬁcient of correlation for the counties with a population density D higher
than 0 (i.e. all counties) and higher than 100 per square kilometer respectively. Similarly, the two columns
with the heading α give the bounds of the conﬁdence intervals (at 95% likelihood) which are closest to 0;
roughly speaking, the higher α, the more signiﬁcant is the correlation. The coefﬁcient of correlation for D > 0
is particularly low when there are many rural counties (e.g. Louisiana or Texas). The table shows that an
increased density threshold almost always leads to a higher correlation but that α is improved only whenever
the state has a substantial number of high density counties (e.g. Georgia, Massachusetts, New York or Ohio).
Note that, for historical reasons, Virginia’s county list contains 41 “cities”, many of which are in fact small
towns, e.g. Bedford City has a population of 6,073. The non-improvement of α in this case clearly shows that
what matters is the “real” degree of urbanization.

−0.28).

The fact that White ﬂight is paralleled by Black and Hispanic ﬂights is conﬁrmed by examining
the correlations between the population changes of these three population components. This is the
purpose of the next section.

5 White ﬂight, Black ﬂight, Hispanic ﬂight

Once again, we begin by examining the case of New Jersey. Fig. 3c shows that the changes in Black
and White non-Hispanic population changes are highly correlated. The coefﬁcient of correlation c is
equal to 0.95 and the slope of the regression line is: a = 0.89±0.12, which means that ∆y ∼ ∆x. For
the Hispanic and White non-Hispanic population changes the correlation is even higher with c = 0.99
and a = 1.25 ± 0.07. The same ﬁndings hold for other states as well at least above a population
density threshold of about 50 per square kilometer (see Table 4).

6 Conclusion and future prospects

At ﬁrst sight the previous observation seems to be at variance with the standard mechanism of White
ﬂight. For cities such as Cleveland or Detroit, it is usually described as a three stage process. (i) Move
of Blacks to northern industrial cities during World War II and concurrent move of White people to
suburban areas6. These opposite ﬂows of population resulted in the replacement of high or medium
wage earners by low wage earners. (ii) Fall in municipal revenue and accompanying decline in public
services. (iii) Decline in overall city population.

This description is not consistent with the ﬁndings of this paper. Yet, as the evidence presented in
this paper pertains to the period 1990-1996, it can be argued that it cannot shed new light on what
happened in the 1950s. This is certainly true although it is tempting, at least as a working hypothesis,
to posit that the movements of population are ruled by mechanisms which are fairly robust in the
course of time.

Apart from Cleveland and Detroit, does the above mechanism apply to other cities? By considering
other large cities, one comes to the conclusion that this mechanism does not have a broad validity. For
instance, a growing minority population does not necessarily result in an overall population decline.

6This move was not entirely “spontaneous” but was encouraged by the availability of affordable mortgages for new
homes in the suburbs and by the development of highways. It can be noted that both mortgages and highway constructions
were subsidized by the federal government.

Although this was indeed the case in Cincinnati, Cleveland or Detroit, it is by no means a general rule
as shown by the following counter-examples:

• In New Orleans the Black population increased approximately in the same way as in Detroit, i.e.
from about 33% in 1950 to about 60% in 1980. Yet, in contrast to Detroit where the total population
fell by 35%, it remained almost unchanged in New Orleans.

• In Los Angeles, the share of the minority population increased from 16% in 1960 to about 60%

in 2000; yet the total population increased by 48% instead of decreasing.

• In Boston, the minorities represented only 28% in 1980. Yet, from 1950 to 1980 the total
population decreased by 30%, almost as rapidly as in Detroit. A similar but less known example is
provided by the city of Charleston in West Virginia. With a population of only 53,000 in 2000 it is
a small city yet the largest in the state. Its minority population represents 16% (15% Black and 1%
Hispanic). Yet, between 1950 and 2000 its population dropped by 27%.

According to the observations made in this paper, all population components tend to converge toward
places which offer adequate employment and to avoid places with little opportunities. As a matter of
fact, this mechanism can also explain typical white ﬂight cases such as Cleveland or Detroit. In the
1950s these cities suffered from several handicaps.

• In the U.S. as well as in European countries the second half of the 20th century was marked by
a migration trend toward sunny areas, for example toward the states of Arizona, California, Florida or
Texas. As a consequence, the Midwest states lost their attractiveness unless they had speciﬁc assets.
• In a time of declining industrial activity, the Cleveland-Cincinnati-Detroit area had the misfor-

Notes: WnH means White non-Hispanic, B means Black, H means Hispanic. The WnH-B column gives the
correlations between x = change in WnH population, y1 = change in B population. The WnH-H column gives
the correlations between the same x variable and y2 = Change in H population. D denotes the population
density expressed in population per square kilometer. The low correlation in Texas which is obtained when all
counties are included are due to the fact that Texas has a great number of rural counties with small populations
and densities. Only 11% of the 254 counties have a population density over 50 per square kilometer. Naturally,
counties with small populations can experience very large population changes. Thus, for instance, the county
of Lasalle (total 1990 population of 5,254 and density=1.4 per sq. km) experienced a 845% increase in its black
population which grew from 53 in 1990 to 501 in 1996. Such large changes result in a huge dispersion and thus
in a low correlation. When these rural counties are left aside, the correlation becomes much higher.

tune that its economy was mainly based on shrinking industrial sectors.

• Moreover, these cities had no renowned universities and their centers had none of the assets of

cities such as Boston, Manhattan or San Francisco.

In short, the decline of this region was probably inevitable even if the population had been mono-
ethnic. As a matter of fact, similar declines were experienced in regions which had the same handi-
caps, for instance the Birmingham-Liverpool area in Britain or the regions devoted to heavy industry
in the north and north-east of France.

In conclusion, the following picture emerges from this study. The different population components
have basically the same behavior in the sense that they are attracted by or kept away from the same
areas. However, due to their higher income, White people have a greater mobility. They can afford
a home in suburban areas as well as adequate means of transportation whereas Black people remain
trapped in areas in which they arrived in a time of good opportunities but which they cannot leave as
quickly as whites once these opportunities have vanished.

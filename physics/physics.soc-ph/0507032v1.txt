1. Introduction

The dynamics in many complex systems involves a ﬂux through components arranged
in a heterogeneous network. Examples range from cell metabolism [1], food webs [2],
supply networks [3], and river networks [4], to the way in which raw materials are
combined and transformed into intermediate or consumption goods in an economy [5].
Mathematically, these phenomena can be cast into linear programming problems, for
solving which eﬃcient algorithms exist even for large instances. In each of these cases,
however, it is important to understand whether the emerging global properties are due
to the speciﬁc wiring of the input-output relationships or whether they are generic of
large random realizations of any such problem. Put diﬀerently, the study of the typical
properties of large random systems provides a useful “null hypothesis” against which
speciﬁc results should be compared. The theoretical machinery for this kind of study
is provided by the statistical mechanics of disordered systems and has already been
applied to speciﬁc large random linear programming problems in the past [6, 7].

One of the areas where such problems arise more frequently is economics. The study
of typical properties of large random economies [8,9] is particularly relevant, ﬁrst because
it allows one to go beyond the simplistic framework of the so-called ‘representative

Von Neumann’s model for large random economies

agent’, by accounting for the heterogeneity across agents and their interactions in many
dimensions (technological capabilities, budgets, endowments, etc). Secondly because,
contrary to biology, economic time scales are such that evolutionary design might not
play a dominant role in shaping the (global properties of) interaction network. Hence,
in real economies the latter might be closer to a large random instance than for e.g.
metabolic networks.

In this paper, we will study a simple model of economic growth, put forward by
J. Von Neumann in the 1930’s [5]. It describes economic growth as an autocatalytic
process by which the outputs generated at any time are used either for consumption or
as inputs for production at the later stage. This model has been widely studied and
plays a central role in economic theory [10–13], as it forms the backbone of more reﬁned
. Our aim
models providing the key insights for understanding growth in the long run
‡
is that of characterizing the growth properties in terms of the underlying structural
complexity of the production activity. More precisely, we shall compute the maximal
growth rate of the economy as a function of the ratio between the number of production
processes and the number of goods, and of the parameters of the distribution of input-
output matrices. We shall also compute the number of active production processes and
of “intermediate” goods, whose output is used entirely for further production. These
results shed light on the way in which growth is aﬀected by technological innovation,
namely by an enrichment of the repertoire of available technologies, and in turn how
this aﬀects the activity levels.

In the rest of the paper, we shall ﬁrst introduce the model, then present the

statistical mechanics approach and ﬁnally discuss the results.

2. The model

i (respectively Sibµ

In somewhat simpliﬁed terms, Von Neumann’s expanding model may be presented as
follows. One considers an economy with P commodities (labeled µ) and N technologies
(labeled i), each of which can be operated at a non-negative scale Si ≥
0 and is
bµ
characterized by an output vector ai =
and by an input vector bi =
, such

that Siaµ
i ) denotes the units of commodity µ produced (respectively
used) by process i when run at scale Si. It is assumed that input/output vectors are
ﬁxed in time and that operation scales are the degrees of freedom to be set, for instance,
by ﬁrms. At time (or period) t, the economy is characterized by an aggregate input
i Si(t)aµ
and output vector for each commodity, I µ(t) =
i
respectively. Part of the latter will be used as the input at period t + 1 whereas the rest,

expansion described by Von Neumann’s model.

is consumed at time t.
In absence of external sources, a necessary condition is that
inputs at any time do not exceed the outputs at the previous time, i.e. one must have
C µ(t)
0 for all µ at all times. In this way, the model describes a closed economy which
is able to provide the society with all commodities without relying on external sources.
Modern economic growth theories introduce a value for the stream of consumption C µ(t)
for all t and µ – usually by postulating a utility function and a discount factor – and look
i=1, as a function of some initial condition I µ(0).
N
for optimal growth paths
Von Neumann’s model instead focuses on the simpler issue of studying the feasibility of
paths with a constant rate – i.e. such that I µ(t + 1) = ρI µ(t) with ρ > 0 a constant –
and, in particular, on computing the highest feasible growth rate. These two problems
are related because, under generic conditions, the optimal path coincides with that of
maximal expansion apart from an initial transient [14]. This is why Von Neumann’s
model is relevant for long run properties of models of economic growth. For paths with
constant expansion rate, the scales of production have the form Si(t) = siρt and likewise
C µ(t) = cµρt. The (technological) expansion problem then amounts to calculating the
maximum ρ > 0 such that a conﬁguration s =

ρ times its aggregate input. If the maximum ρ, which we denote by ρ⋆, is larger than
1 the economy is ‘expanding’, whereas it is ‘contracting’ for ρ⋆ < 1. It is a rigorously
established fact that if aµ
0 for all i and µ, ρ⋆ exists (see [15] for a simple
proof). On the other hand, the actual value of ρ⋆ is expected to depend on the input
and output matrices. Intuitively, ρ⋆ should increase with the number N of technologies
and decrease when the economy is required to produce a larger number P of goods.

In this work we study a fully heterogeneous version of above problem with technologies
diﬀerent from each other. We focus on random instances where aµ
i are quenched
random variables drawn from a certain probability distribution. More speciﬁcally, we
shall consider the pair (aµ

and bµ
i are zero-average
quenched random variables. Inserting these into (2) one easily sees that to leading order
(in N) ρ⋆ is given by the ratio a/b of the average output and average input coeﬃcients.
In particular, the leading part of ρ does not depend on the structure of the input output
matrices. The non trivial aspects of the problem are related to the corrections to the
leading part. We therefore write the growth rate as

through the combination g⋆/√k. This completely characterizes the dependence of the
maximal growth rate on the parameters of the disorder distribution.

If as g

This condition implies that the number of active processes equals that of intermediate
commodities at g⋆. Noting that for any µ such that cµ = 0 we have a linear equation
for the scales si > 0, we see also that (21) simply corresponds to the requirement that
the number of equations should match the number of variables.

Eqs.

(18), (20) and (21) allow us to compute g⋆ as a function of n and k. As
√k can be read oﬀ directly from the equations,
already noticed, the dependence g⋆
hence g⋆/√k is an universal function of n, independent of the details of the distribution
of input-output coeﬃcients (as long as they are i.i.d.). Actually, since k enters the
equations only through the combination g⋆/√k, and this is a function of n, then the
solution itself will be universal, i.e. independent of k.

Indeed, by Eq. (16), g⋆ = 0 corresponds to a situation where half of the goods are not
consumed (φ0 = 1/2) while Eq. (20) yields t2 = q/(2n), which is consistent with the
other equations for z = 0, i.e. n = 1. At this same point, half of the technologies are
operated (ψ0 = 1/2). This means that, when there are more technologies than goods

(n > 1) a growth rate higher than that of the ratio a/b of average output and input
coeﬃcients is achievable. The growth rate is instead smaller than a/b when n < 1.

The inset of Fig.

1 shows the fraction of inactive processes ψ0 and that of
intermediate commodities φ0 at g⋆, as a function of n. For what we said earlier, these
are universal functions of n independent of the details of the disorder distribution. Both
φ0 and ψ0 tend to one when n increases.

4. Discussion

In summary, we have studied the typical properties of the Von Neumann expanding
model in the case where input-output matrices have i.i.d.
random elements. We
characterize the region of feasible expansion paths and focus on the solutions at its
boundary, which correspond to the paths of maximal expansion. We uncover an
universal behavior,
independent of the details of the distribution, of the relevant

quantities.
optimal growth rate increases, but the economy becomes more and more selective both
on the processes which are used and on the goods which are consumed.

At a purely speculative level, our results allow us to draw conclusions on how
long term growth on the maximal expansion path will be aﬀected by technological
innovation. The latter, deﬁned as the introduction of new designs, i.e. new feasible
ways of combining inputs to produce desirable outputs [18] would just correspond, in
our simpliﬁed world, to an increase in the number N of transformation processes which
the economy has at its disposal. By Eq. (3) the change in the growth rate is related
to the change in g⋆/√n, which is plotted in Fig. 1. This shows that when n is small

i.e. an increase in N can have a large positive impact on long term growth. For
1) instead, g⋆/√n increases much more slowly,
technologically mature economies (n
hence technological innovation has much smaller eﬀect on long term growth. These
insights are remarkably similar to those derived in [9] for model of general economic
equilibrium.

≫

There are several directions in which the present work could be extended. First,
it would be desirable to study more realistic ensembles of input-output matrices, or
more detailed models of economic growth. In particular, realistic technologies only have
a ﬁnite number of inputs and outputs, which would call for the use of techniques for
disordered systems with diluted interactions. It would also be interesting to generalize
this study to the case where the input-output transformation is subject to stochasticity.
A further natural extension of this approach concerns the analysis of typical properties
of large random metabolic [1] or supply networks [3], or of food webs [2].

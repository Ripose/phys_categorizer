Abstract

It has been shown that many complex networks shared distinctive features, which diﬀer in

many ways from the random and the regular networks. Although these features capture important

characteristics of complex networks, their applicability depends on the type of networks. To unravel

ubiquitous characteristics that complex networks may have in common, we adopt the clustering

coeﬃcient as the probability measure, and present a systematic analysis of various types of complex

networks from the perspective of statistical self-similarity. We ﬁnd that the probability distribution

of the clustering coeﬃcient is best characterized by the multifractal; moreover, the support of the

measure had a fractal dimension. These two features enable us to describe complex networks in a

uniﬁed way; at the same time, oﬀer unforeseen possibilities to comprehend complex networks.

INTRODUCTION

The structure of complex systems across various disciplines can be abstracted and con-

ceptualized as networks (or graphs) of nodes and links to which many quantitative methods

can be applied so as to extract any characteristics embedded in the system [1]. Numerous

complex systems have been expressed in terms of networks, and have often been categorized

by the research ﬁeld, such as social [2, 3], technological [4, 5], and biological networks [6, 7],

to name a few.

It was shown that many complex networks had distinctive global features in common,

including the small-world [8] and the scale-free [9] properties. These uncovered character-

istics distinguish complex networks from the random and the regular networks in that the

average path between any two nodes is shorter while maintaining highly clustered connec-

tions, and that the degree of nodes approximately follows a power law distribution.

In

addition to the global characteristics, investigations on complex networks at the local level

have been directed to reveal local characteristics from the perspective of ﬁnding patterns

of interconnections among nodes. Notable examples include the network motif [10], the

(dis)assortativity [11, 12], and the topological modules in the metabolic [13] as well as the

protein interaction networks [12]. Motivated by these characteristics, numerous models for

the network growth and evolution have been proposed to understand the underlying mech-

anism of complex networks.

To gain further understanding of complex networks, we investigate local features of the

networks from the perspective of the statistical self-similarity. This may provide us with not

only deeper insight into complex networks, but a uniﬁed way of describing them. To this

end, we focus on the clustering coeﬃcient [8] of a node i, deﬁned as

Ci =

ni
ki (ki − 1)

,

(1)

where ni, 0 ≤ ni ≤ ki(ki−1), is the number of directed links (an undirected link counts twice)

among ki nearest neighbor nodes of the node i. It is a measure of the interconnectivity among

nearest neighbors of a node, or the modularity [13], thus can be a quantity representing the

local structure of the network.

The clustering coeﬃcient has been analyzed from the perspective of the degree correlation.

It was found that the clustering coeﬃcient correlated with the degree in some complex

2

networks. In particular, there is a power law correlation between the clustering coeﬃcient

and the degree for the deterministic scale-free network model [14], the Internet [15], and

metabolic networks [13].

It is a form of hCi(k) ∼ k−δ, where h·i represents the average

over the same degree, and δ depends on the type of networks. However, a similar analysis

of the clustering coeﬃcient reveals that the power law correlation is not manifest to other

types of networks, such as the protein interaction and social networks. As shown in Fig. 1,

the clustering coeﬃcient of the ﬁlm actor network correlates with the degree not with a

power-law, but exponentially (Fig. 1A); while the neural network has an approximate linear

correlation between the clustering coeﬃcient and the degree (Fig. 1B). Moreover, there is

no evident correlation in the protein networks (Fig. 1C, 1D).

This ﬁnding suggests that in general the clustering coeﬃcient is not a simple quantity

which can be related for some common ground to other quantities, such as the degree.

Thus, it is desirable to analyze the clustering coeﬃcient beyond the degree correlation. In

this paper, we focus on the systematic analysis of the clustering coeﬃcient in the wide classes

of complex networks [16], together with theoretical models for the complex networks, such

as the random [17], the scale-free [9], and the small-world networks [8].

II. DATA DESCRIPTION

We analyzed the clustering coeﬃcient in the complex networks of the ﬁlm actor network,

WWW, the scientiﬁc collaboration network, metabolic networks, protein interaction

networks, the neural network, and the Internet of both Autonomous System (AS) and the

router levels; together with models for the random, the scale-free, and the small-world

networks. For directed networks such as metabolic networks and WWW, we distinguish the

network into the directionality (in-degree and out-degree) and carry out separate analysis.

The source of the network data is in Ref. [16], and more information of each network is the

following.

Film actor: An actor represents a node, and actors casted in the same movie are linked.

(374511 nodes and 2445818 undirected links)

Scientiﬁc collaboration: Each author corresponds to a node and co-authors are linked

among others in the Los Alamos E-print Archive between 1995 and 1999 (inclusive) in the

ﬁeld of the condensed matter. (13861 nodes and 89238 undirected links)

3

Internet of Autonomous Systems (AS) level: Each autonomous system represents a

node, and a physical network connection between nodes represents a link. (6474 nodes and

25144 undirected links)

Internet of router level: The Internet connection at the router level. The data is

collected by the Mercator (http://www.isi.edu/scan/mercator/), a program that infers

the router-level connectivity of the Internet. (284772 nodes and 898456 undirected links)

WWW: World Wide Web connection network for http://www.nd.edu. Each HTML

document represents a node, connected directionally by a hyperlink pointing from one

document to another. It is a directed network of 325729 nodes and 1469679 directed links.

Metabolic networks: Metabolic networks of six organisms, two for each domain, are

analyzed. They are Archaeoglobus fulgidus (459 nodes and 2155 directed links) and

Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (399 nodes and 1937 directed links) in Archae;

Escherichia coli (698 nodes and 3747 directed links) and Salmonella typhi (735 nodes and

3882 directed links) in Bacteria; Saccharomyces cerevisiae (511 nodes and 2690 directed

links) and Caenorhabditis elegans (413 nodes and 2061 directed links) in Eukaryote. Note

that the metabolic network is a directed network.

Protein interaction networks: We have analyzed protein interaction networks of six

organisms. They are Saccharomyces cerevisiae (4687 nodes and 30312 undirected links),

Escherichia coli (145 nodes and 388 undirected links), Caenorhabditis elegans (2386 nodes

and 7650 undirected links), Drosophila melanogaster (6926 nodes and 41490 undirected

links), Helicobacter pylori (686 nodes and 2702 undirected links), and Homo sapiens (563

nodes and 1740 undirected links)

Neural network: Somatic nervous system of Nematode C. elegans except that in the

pharynz is considered. A link joins two nodes representing neurons, if they are connected

by either a synapse or a gap junction. All links are treated as undirected. (265 nodes and

3664 undirected links)

III. MULTIFRACTALITY OF COMPLEX NETWORKS

The set of Ci for each network can be used to form a probability distribution (Fig. 2). As

shown in Fig. 2A-2D, the distribution of Ci in complex networks diﬀer considerably from that

4

of the random network (Fig. 2F). Probability distributions for complex networks bring out

high irregularity of various intensities in diﬀerent clustering coeﬃcients, developing a long tail

extending to either large (Fig. 2A-2C) or small (Fig. 2D) values of the clustering coeﬃcient.

This suggests that not a few but many, possibly inﬁnite, parameters may be needed to

characterize the distribution. To quantify the variation in the distribution, a continuous

spectrum of scaling indices has been proposed [18]. For the spectrum that quantiﬁes the

inhomogeneity in the probability distribution, we utilize the clustering coeﬃcient as the

probability measure, and analyze the distribution from the perspective of the statistical

self-similarity, the multifractal [19, 20].

The multifractal, which is not necessarily related to geometrical properties [21], is a way

to describe diﬀerent self-similar properties for diﬀerent “regions” in an appropriate set (in

our case, diﬀerent values of the clustering coeﬃcient), and applied, for instance, to the

fully developed turbulence [21, 22], which is one of the most common examples of complex

systems. It consists of spectra displaying the range of scaling indices and their density in the

set, thus has been used to explain richer and more complex scaling behavior of a system than

the case in the critical phenomena. The multifractal can be accomplished by examining the

scaling properties of the measure characterized by the singularity strength α and its fractal

dimension f (α), which roughly indicates how often a particular value of α occurs [18]. In

practice, α and f (α) are customarily obtained from the Legendre transformation of q and

Dq, via

and

α =

{(q − 1)Dq} ,

d
dq

f (α) = qα − (q − 1)Dq ,

where Dq is the generalized correlation dimension often estimated by the correlation integral

method [23]. It is the quantity for anomalous scaling law whose value depends on diﬀerent

moment q. Dq is deﬁned as

Dq = lim
R→0

1
q − 1

ln Sq(R)
ln R

,

where Sq(R) is known as the correlation sum (or correlation integral), and it is given, using

Heaviside function Θ, as

M

Sq(R) =

)

(2)

(3)

(4)

where M is the number of nodes and Ci is the clustering coeﬃcient of node i. The spectrum

Dq may be smoothed before transforming into α and f (α) to avoid the contradiction of the

general property of Dq, i.e., Dq ≤ Dq′

if q′ ≤ q.

There is a diﬃculty in taking the limit R → 0 in Eq. (4) for a ﬁnite number of data

points. Due to the ﬁniteness, there always exists the minimum distance of |Cj − Ck|. Thus,

when R is less than the minimum distance, the correlation sum becomes zero and no longer

scales with R. Therefore, in practice, the generalized dimension Dq is determined by plotting

ln Sq(R)/(q − 1) as a function of ln R and estimating the slope within an appropriate scaling

region using a least square ﬁt. The error associated with the ﬁt can be obtained as a

statistical uncertainty based on ﬁtting a straight line in the scaling region.

Fig. 3 displays the estimated f (α) versus α for various complex networks. As shown

in Fig. 3A-3D, the inﬁnitely many diﬀerent fractal dimensions, manifested by the shapes

of f (α), suggest that the measure is a multifractal, and thus, cannot be explained by a

single fractal dimension. All of the complex networks we have examined, except for the

neural network of Caenorhabditis elegans, form multifractals irrespective of their global

characteristics, such as the number of nodes and their degree distributions. Furthermore,

for all complex networks we have analyzed, the average and standard deviation of the most

probable singularity strength α0, where f (α) takes its maximum value, are hα0i = 1.2 ± 0.3;

those of f (α0) are hf (α0)i = 0.8 ± 0.1.

The multifractal observed in complex networks implies that the distribution of clustering

coeﬃcients can be described as interwoven sets of singularities of strength α, each of which

has its corresponding fractal dimension f (α) [18]. In our case, this implies that diﬀerent

values (or range of values) of the clustering coeﬃcient may have diﬀerent fractal dimensions.

From the viewpoint of network dynamics in which rewiring and/or adding new nodes and

links are involved, the multifractal suggests that as a network grows, nodes of large clustering

coeﬃcients change their clustering coeﬃcients by a factor that diﬀers from nodes of small

clustering coeﬃcients change theirs.

The diﬀerent rate of changing the clustering coeﬃcient may stem from two sources (or

modes): the degree of a node k and the corresponding interconnectivity n. For a ﬁxed k,

the clustering coeﬃcient depends only on the interconnectivity n, so that C ∼ n. In this

case, the dynamics (via rewiring and/or adding new links) drive networks in such a way that

diﬀerent values of n are not equally probable; rather, some values of n are more probable

6

than others. This assertion is further supported by the fact that as k increases, the number

of distinct n does not increase quadratically in k, and that n and k are linearly correlated
(see below). For a ﬁxed n, C ∼ k−2. Thus, the addition of new links to higher degree

nodes is more likely to drop their clustering coeﬃcient much faster than that of new links

to lower degree ones. Therefore, the dynamics of complex networks can be characterized by

an evolution via interplay between the two sources.

Contrary to most complex networks, the irregularity of the distribution is absent in the

neural network of Caenorhabditis elegans (Fig. 2E). The estimate Dq ≈ 0.83 < 1 is inde-

pendent of q, resulting in α = f (α) ≈ 0.83. Thus, the measure is not a multifractal, rather

it can be characterized by a single fractal dimension. The absence of the multifractality is

probably due to the biologically intrinsic property of the neuron. The geometric character

of the neuron imposes a constraint on the number of synaptic contacts (i.e. links), leaving

no room for the irregularity of the distribution [2, 24].

Typically, f (α) satisﬁes 0 < f (α) < D0, where D0 is the dimension of the support of the

measure, which is the set of clustering coeﬃcients without their relative frequencies. We ﬁnd

D0 < 1 for all complex networks (Fig. 3A-3D), indicating that supports of the measure have

fractal dimensions, just like the Cantor set. This means that forbidden regions are embedded

in the range of allowed clustering coeﬃcients so that some values are highly suppressed. A

possible cause of the suppression might stem from the correlation between the degree k of

a node and its corresponding interconnectivity n. A simple statistic, such as the Pearson’s

correlation coeﬃcient r, ranging −1 < r < 1, can be used to quantify the correlation, as it

reﬂects to what extent the two quantities are linearly correlated. The result (Fig. 4A) reveals

that complex networks have higher linear correlation than the random network. Moreover,

some complex networks, such as metabolic networks and the Internet of AS level, disclose

strong linear correlations (r > 0.95).

For metabolic networks and the Internet of AS level in which the degree of a node and

its interconnectivity among its nearest neighbor nodes are strongly correlated, we ask how

the next nearest neighbor nodes are interconnected, and whether the distribution of the

corresponding clustering coeﬃcients maintains the multifractality. To this end, we extend

the deﬁnition of the clustering coeﬃcient to the next nearest nodes by including the next

nearest nodes for both the degree of a node k and its interconnectivity n, which is the number

of links between two next nearest nodes. The irregularity and the long-tail characteristics

7

are again found in the distribution of the extended clustering coeﬃcient, suggesting the

existence of the multifractal. As shown in Fig. 4B-4D, the probability distribution of the

extended version of the measure can again be characterized by the multifractal, indicating

that the statistical self-similarity is not necessarily restricted to the local interconnectivity.

By including the next nearest neighbor nodes to the deﬁnition of the clustering coeﬃcient,

more distinct values of the clustering coeﬃcient are possible than that of the nearest neighbor

nodes. This can be expected since the extended version of the clustering coeﬃcient of a

node includes an average over the clustering coeﬃcients of its nearest neighbor nodes, partly

smoothing out the irregularity. This is also manifested by the fact that D∗

0, the dimension

of the support of the extended clustering coeﬃcient, is bigger than corresponding D0.

Based on the multifractal found in complex networks, for comparison, we carried out

similar analysis to models of the random, the scale-free, and the small-world networks. In

the case of the random network, the clustering coeﬃcients are smoothly distributed, by

having a “bell-shape” (Fig. 2F). Furthermore, Dq ≈ 1.0 for all q, indicating that there is no

self-similarity. This can be expected since the support of the measure can be regarded as a

line, which is one dimensional.

The distribution of the clustering coeﬃcient for the scale-free network shows the irregu-

larity, similar to the case of complex networks; furthermore the distribution can be described

by the multifractal (Fig. 3E). From simulation results with various diﬀerent parameters for

the network, however, we found that not only the most probable singularity strength α0

(0.64 < α0 < 0.76), but the dimension of the support D0 (0.45 < D0 < 0.50) is smaller

than that of complex networks, suggesting that more severe restriction is imposed on the

possible values of the clustering coeﬃcient. According to the model, nodes of higher degree

are preferred to have additional links rather than those of lower degree. This preferential

attachment leaves the clustering coeﬃcient of high degree nodes to decrease much faster

than that of low degree ones. Thus when the number of nodes is doubled, for instance,

the clustering coeﬃcient of high degree nodes changes by a factor diﬀerent from that of low

degree nodes, analogous to the kinetics of the diﬀusion-limited aggregation [25].

For the small-world network, the rewiring probability p dictates both the irregularity in

the distribution and the multifractality. For a small rewiring probability (say, p = 0.01), the

multifractal emerges (Fig. 3F); however the dimension of the support is D0 ≈ 1.0, implying

that the set of the measure entirely covers the space of the clustering coeﬃcient. As the

8

rewiring probability increases, the range of the clustering coeﬃcients becomes smaller and

the degree of inhomogeneity decreases, and then the network ﬁnally becomes a random

network as we can easily anticipate.

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

Based on the irregularity of intensities in the probability distribution of the clustering

coeﬃcient, we regarded the clustering coeﬃcient as the probability measure and analyzed

the clustering coeﬃcient of various types of complex networks from the perspective of the

statistical self-similarity. We found that the probability measure and the support of the

measure can be characterized by the multifractal and the fractal, respectively. Furthermore,

for complex networks having strong linear correlation between the degree and the inter-

connectivity, the multifractality extends into the clustering coeﬃcient of the next nearest

neighbor nodes. These characteristics are unique to the real complex networks and cannot

be found in the random network. From the aspect of the multifractality, models of the

scale-free and the small-world diﬀer from real networks in the distribution of the singularity

strength f (α).

The statistical self-similarity in the distribution of the clustering coeﬃcient can be served

as a general characteristic of complex networks; at the same time, giving a further insight

into the understanding of complex networks. The multifractality shared by diﬀerent complex

networks suggests that a similar law may govern the diverse complex networks of nature as

well as artiﬁciality. Furthermore, it can be used to classify the complex networks, and serves

as a “touchstone” of proposed models for complex networks.

FIG. 4: (A): The linear correlation coeﬃcients r of complex networks plotted against the number

of nodes are compared with the random networks of diﬀerent numbers of nodes: the metabolic

networks ((cid:3)), the Internet of AS level (△), the scientiﬁc collaboration network (▽), protein in-

teraction networks ((cid:13)), the actor network (N), WWW (H), the Internet of router level (•), and

the random network ((cid:4)). For random networks, each node has on average 10 links. (B)-(D): f (α)

versus α for selected organisms in the metabolic networks and the Internet of the AS level. D∗
0

represents the dimension of the support for the extended clustering coeﬃcient. (B) the metabolic

network of Archaeoglobus fulgidus (in-degree), (C) the metabolic network of Caenorhabditis elegans

(in-degree), (D) the Internet of AS level. Note that D∗

0 for (B)-(D) are larger than corresponding

D0 for the case of the nearest neighbor, where, from 3B to 3D, D0 = 0.79, 0.73, 0.87, respectively.

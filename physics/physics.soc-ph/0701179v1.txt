Abstract. We study the temporal evolution of the market eﬃciency in the stock markets using the complex-
ity, entropy density, standard deviation, autocorrelation function, and probability distribution of the log
return for Standard and Poor’s 500 (S&P 500), Nikkei stock average index, and Korean composition stock
price index (KOSPI). Based on the microscopic spin model, we also ﬁnd that these statistical quantities
in stock markets depend on the market eﬃciency.

1 Introduction

Econophysics is one of the most active ﬁelds in interdis-
ciplinary research [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13]. Time se-
ries analysis and agent based modelling have been stud-
ied by many researchers. There are many methodologies
to analyze the ﬁnancial time series. Observing probabil-
ity distribution functions (FDFs) of log return is one of
the simplest and the most popular methods. Many re-
search papers about PDFs of log return for stock markets
have already been published [10,11,12,13,14,15]. The dif-
ferent characteristics between mature markets and emerg-
ing markets [11], market eﬃciency [12], and the relation
between shape of PDFs and time lags [13] are studied us-
ing PDFs. Also it is used to distinguish between bubble
and anti-bubble [9,10].

Another method is computational mechanics [16]. Com-
putational mechanics has been studied various ﬁelds of
science [17,18,19], and it is applied to analyze the stock
market [7]. Computational mechanics is available to an-
alyze complexity and structure quantitatively by ﬁnding
intrinsic causal structures of time series [20].

Agent based modelling has been widely used in so-
cial science and econophysics to construct artiﬁcial so-
cial and economic systems. Agent based models in econo-
physics are constructed using agents clustering [1], Ising-
like spin model [2,12], and Potts-like model [4]. Variation
of PDFs shapes by traders’ characteristics [10] and infor-
mation ﬂow [12], and speculative activity explaining bub-
bles and crashes in stock market [5] have been simulated
by agent based model.

In this paper, we analyze the time series of Standard
and Poor’s (S&P 500), Nikkei stock average index, and

Korean composition stock price index (KOSPI) by time
evolution of statistical measures such as PDFs of log re-
turn, autocorrelation function, complexity, entropy den-
sity, and scaling properties of the standard deviation of
log return changes. Moreover, we construct the stock mar-
ket using microscopic spin model to simulate above time
series results.

2 Empirical data and analysis

We use the S&P 500 data mainly for the period from 1983
to 2006. Japanese data for the period from 1997 to 2005
and Korean data for the period from 1992 to 2003 are
also used to support and conﬁrm the results from S&P
500. The data resolution is high frequency (1 minute) data,
and we use only intra-day returns to exclude discontinuity
jumps between the previous day’s close and the next day’s
open price due to the overnight eﬀects. The price return
is deﬁned as

S(t)

log Y (t + ∆t)

log Y (t),

(1)

≡

−

where Y (t) is the price at time t and ∆t is the time lag.

2.1 Probability distribution and autocorrelation

Fig. 1 (a) shows temporal evolution of tail index in PDFs
for S&P 500, Nikkei stock index, and KOSPI. Tail index of
PDFs increases from around 2 to above 4 as time passes.
In 2000s, the shape of PDF becomes narrower and the tail
part becomes thinner, while PDF has fatter tail and the
slope of tail part is more steep in 1990s. Autocorrelation
function is deﬁned as follows:

R(τ ) =

< S(t)S(t + τ ) >
σ2

When µ is larger than 0.5, the time series has long range
correlation, while long range anticorrelation when µ < 0.5.
There is no correlation at µ = 0.5 and strength of correla-
tion (or anticorrelation) is proportional to the diﬀerence
between µ and 0.5. Fig. 2 shows the temporal evolution of
scaling properties of the standard deviation of log return
changes. The value of µ decreases to around 0.5. Until the
mid 1990s, time series of stock market index has strong
long range correlation. However, long range correlation
practically disappears in 2000s.

dard deviation of autocorrelation function for the S&P 500,

where σ is a standard deviation of S(t). Moreover, the
standard deviation of autocorrelation function is deﬁned
as follows:

ΣACF =< R(τ )2 >

< R(τ ) >2 .

Fig. 1 (b) shows the temporal evolution of standard devia-
tion of autocorrelation function. The increasing tendency
for tail index is reverse to it for standard deviation of au-
tocorrelation function. We can guess that the reason why
probability distributions of log return are changed is re-
lated to autocorrelation of log return time series.

2.2 Scaling property of standard deviation

We investigate the long range memory of log return by
observing the time evolution of scaling properties in the
standard deviation of log return changes [8]. The standard
deviation of log price changes is deﬁned as

σ(∆t) = qP

as a function of the time lag ∆t. The relation between
standard deviation and time lag is as follows:

2.3 Entropy density and statistical complexity

We also analyze ﬁnancial time series using computational
mechanics to ﬁnd the statistical complexity and the en-
tropy density. In order to calculate the statistical complex-
ity and the entropy density, we used causal-state splitting
reconstruction (CSSR) algorithm [16] to model ǫ-machine
of the stock markets.

Claude Shannon suggested the entropy of a discrete
random variable X with a probability function P (x) [21]
as follows:

H[X] =

P (x) log2 P (x).

(6)

Let A be a countable set of symbols of time series and let
S be a random variable for A, and s is its realization. If
a block of string with L consecutive variable is denoted
as SL = S1, ..., SL, then Shannon entropy of length L is
deﬁned as

H[X] =

P (s1, ..., sL) log2 P (s1, ..., sL).

Also entropy density for the ﬁnite length L is deﬁne as

as a function of block length L where L = 1, 2, 3,
tropy density is more useful because it is normalized quan-
tity while H(L) also increases as L increases.

In next, to calculate statistical complexity ǫ-machine
has to be deﬁned. An inﬁnity string S↔ can be divided into
two semi-inﬁnite parts such as a future S→ and a history
S←. A causal state is deﬁned as a set of histories that have
the same conditional distribution for all the futures. ǫ is
a function that maps each history to the sets of histories,
each of which corresponds to a causal state:

and entropy density increases in all three markets as time
passes. Statistical complexity is around 1 when time series
has regular pattern or it is totally random. Time series is
totally random when entropy density is around 1 because
it is a measure of disorder. So we can ﬁnd out that the
time series of stock markets is getting more randomly and
the patterns in the time series almost disappear in 2000s.

3 Model and results

(9)

The transition probability T (a)

ij denotes the probability
of generating a symbol a when making the transition from
state Si to state Sj [22,23].

The combination of the function ǫ from histories to
causal states with the labelled transition probabilities T (a)
ij
is called the ǫ-machine [22], which represents a computa-
tional model underlying the given time series.

Given the ǫ-machine, statistical complexity is deﬁned

as

Cµ

≡ − X{Si}

P (Si) log2 P (Si).

We constructed the microscopic model of many interact-
ing agents to simulate the variation of some statistical
characteristics for the stock price time series by modify-
ing microscopic spin model [2]. The number of agents is N ,
and we consider i = 1, 2, . . . , N agents with orientations
1, corresponding to the decision to buy (+1) and
σi(t) =
sell (
1) stock at discrete time-steps t. The orientation of
agent i at the next step, σi(t + 1), depends on the local
ﬁeld:

−

±

Aij (t)σj (t) + hi(t),

(11)

I pri
i

(t) =

1
N Xj

where Aij (t) represent the time-dependent interaction strength
among agents, and hi(t) is an external ﬁeld reﬂecting the
eﬀect of the environment. The time-dependent interaction
strength among agents is Aij(t) = Aξ(t) + aηij (t) with
ξ(t) and ηij (t) determined randomly in every step. A is
an average interaction strength and a is a deviation of the
individual interaction strength. The external ﬁeld reﬂect-
ing the eﬀect of the environment is hi = hζi(t), where h
is an information diﬀusion factor, and ζi(t) is an event
happening at time t and inﬂuencing the i-th agent.

From the local ﬁeld determined as above, agent antic-

ipates log return of stock index as follows:

xexp

non-zero. In case positive α and x(t

the information Ii(t) larger than I pri

So agent refers to past performance, while agents act by

4 Conclusions

Fig. 4 shows (a) PDFs and (b) standard deviation of
autocorrelation function for various α. As α decreases, the
tail is getting thinner and thinner, and the strength of
autocorrelation is reduced. Moreover, scaling exponents
of standard deviation go to 0.5 as α decreases [see Fig. 5].

In Fig. 6, we can conﬁrm the tendency of statistical
complexity and entropy density for various α. As α de-
creases, statistical complexity decreases and entropy den-
sity increases.

We analyze the time series of stock index of U. S., Japan,
and Korea using some statistical measures and simulate
them by microscopic agent based spin model.

Time series has a fat tail in log return distribution and
a tail index is increased as time passes to present. Exis-
tence of pattern in the ﬁnancial time series can be con-
ﬁrmed by autocorrelation function, entropy density and
complexity. As time goes from past to present, entropy
density is increased and complexity is decreased. Also au-
tocorrelation is decreased. From these results, the relation

between present data and past data is decreasing and the
pattern in stock log return data disappears.

When α is non-zero, traders adjust their opinion using
the diﬀerence between their anticipated prices and real
market prices, and they anticipate price changes of next
step with adjusted information. In the past, the speed of
information is slower and market is less eﬃcient, so ad-
justing behavior is more eﬀective and active in the same
time interval compare to present. Therefore, the past mar-
ket corresponding to higher α has long range correlation
and vice versa.

(t) in the microscopic spin model is generated ran-
domly because its elements are random variables while
α (x(t
1)) provides regularity to Ii(t) be-
cause eﬀect of this term remains for a while like Markov
chain. When α is 0, entropy density is almost 1 and com-
plexity is 0 because time series for α = 0 are almost ran-
dom. As α is increased, entropy density is decreased and
complexity is increased because the pattern is generated
in the time series.

The reason why these changes occur is that speed of
information ﬂow is becoming fast by the development of
infra for communication such as high speed internet, mo-
bile communication and broadcasting systems. So market
has become more eﬃciency. By the eﬃcient market hy-
pothesis (EMH), the speed of information is so fast that
agents can not gain proﬁt by superiority of information.

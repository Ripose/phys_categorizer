Abstract

We investigate the dynamical behavior in the large scale region of non-equilibrium sys-
tems, by employing data on the assessed value of land in 1983 – 2006 Japan. In the system
θ (x1 and x2 are
we ﬁnd the detailed quasi-balance, which has the symmetry: x1 ↔ a x2
two successive land prices). By using the detailed quasi-balance and Gibrat’s law, we derive
Pareto’s law with varying Pareto index annually. The parameter θ corresponds with the
ratio of Pareto indices (µ1 + 1)/(µ2 + 1), and the relation is conﬁrmed in the empirical data
nicely.

Introduction

In the large scale region of wealth, income, proﬁts, assets, sales, the number of employees

and etc (x), the cumulative probability distribution P (> x) obeys a power-law:

P (> x) ∝ x

−µ .

This power-law and the exponent µ are called Pareto’s law and Pareto index, respectively [1].

Recently, Fujiwara et al. [2] have explained Pareto’s law (and the reﬂection law) by using
the law of detailed balance and Gibrat’s law [3], which are also observed in empirical data. The
detailed balance is time-reversal symmetry observed in a relatively stable economy:

P12(x1, x2) = P12(x2, x1) .

Here x1 and x2 are two successive incomes, proﬁts, assets, sales, etc. and P12(x1, x2) is a joint
probability distribution function (pdf). On the other hand, Gibrat’s law is valid in the large

scale region where the conditional probability distribution of growth rate Q(R|x1) is independent
of the initial value x1:

Q(R|x1) = Q(R) .

(3)

Here growth rate R is deﬁned as the ratio R = x2/x1 and Q(R|x1) is deﬁned by using the pdf
P1(x1) and the joint pdf P1R(x1, R) as Q(R|x1) = P1R(x1, R)/P1(x1) . In the proof, Fujiwara
et al. assume no model and only use these two underlying laws in empirical data. In Ref. [4], it
is reported that the Pareto index is also induced from the reﬂection law.

These ﬁndings are important for the progress of econophysics. Above derivations are, how-
ever, valid only in the economic equilibrium where the detailed balance (2) holds. In order to
discuss the transition, the dynamics should be established by investigating long-term economic
data in which dynamical transitions are observed. Unfortunately, it is diﬃcult to obtain personal
income or company size data for a long period.

In this study, we investigate the dynamical behavior in the large scale region of non-
equilibrium systems, by employing data on the assessed value of land in 1983 – 2006 Japan.
Because the distribution of Japanese land prices has similar features with one of personal in-
come and company size [5], and the long-term database is readily available [6].

In the non-equilibrium system we ﬁnd the detailed quasi-balance, which has the symmetry:
θ. By using the detailed quasi-balance and Gibrat’s law, we derive Pareto’s law with
x1 ↔ a x2
varying Pareto index annually. The parameter θ corresponds with the ratio of Pareto indices
(µ1 + 1)/(µ2 + 1), and the relation is conﬁrmed in the empirical data nicely [7].

2 Detailed quasi-balance

In Japan, land is a very important asset and land prices change annually in a 24-period
(1983 – 2006). This period contains bubble term (1986 – 1991) caused by the abnormal rise of
land prices. The economy correlates with land prices. We employ the database of the assessed
value of land, which indicates the standard land prices, covering the 24-year period from 1983
to 2006.1

The cumulative probability distributions of land prices are shown in Fig. 1 – 5. From Fig. 1 –
5, the power-law is conﬁrmed in the large scale region. For each year, we estimate Pareto index
µ in the range of land prices from 2×105 to 107 yen/m2 where Pareto’s law holds approximately.
Annual change of Pareto index µ from 1983 to 2006 is represented in Fig. 6. In this period,
Pareto index has changed annually. This means that the system is not in equilibrium and the
detailed balance (2) does not hold. Actually, the breakdown in the large scale region is observed
in the scatter plot of all pieces of land assessed in the database (Fig. 7 for instance). There is
no x1 ↔ x2 symmetry in Fig. 7 obviously. On the other hand, the detailed balance (x1 ↔ x2
symmetry) in the large scale region is observed approximately in Fig. 8 for instance.

1

In Ref. [7], the number of data points of land prices increased gradually, because the database only contained
data points which existed in the 2005 evaluation. In this study, the database contains all data points which existed
in every year evaluation. The results, however, do not change seriously.

2

From Fig. 7 – 8, we make a simple assumption that the symmetry of the joint pdf P12(x1, x2)

is represented as a regression line ﬁtted by least-square method as follows

log10 x2 = θ log10 x1 + log10 a .

In this form, the detailed balance (2) has the special symmetry, θ = a = 1. For each scatter
plot, we measure θ, a in the same range where Pareto index µ is estimated and the result is
shown in Fig. 9.

From this symmetry (ax1

θ ↔ x2), we extend the detailed balance (2) to

P12(x1, x2) = P12(

We call this law the detailed quasi-balance.

number of data points is insuﬃcient to observe Gibrat’s law.

Due to the relation of P12(x1, x2)dx1dx2 = P1R(x1, R)dx1dR under the change of variables

4 Conclusion

In this study, we have investigated the dynamical behavior of non-equilibrium system in the
large scale region by employing data on the assessed value of land in 1983 – 2006 Japan. We
have identiﬁed the detailed quasi-balance (5) in the database, and have derived Pareto’s law with
varying Pareto index by assuming Gibrat’s law (3). As a result, we have obtained a relation
between the change of Pareto index µ and the parameter θ in the detailed quasi-balance. The
relation (14) has been conﬁrmed in the empirical data nicely.

What does the other parameter a mean? Because we demand detailed quasi-balance in the
system, the area above the regression line (4) equals the area below it. The two parameters θ
and a are, therefore, related to each other. The relation is expressed as

θ = 1 −

log10 a .

Γ

(15)

Here 10Γ is suﬃcient large number compared with the upper bound (107) where θ and a are
estimated. This is the reason why the two parameters θ and a vary in opposite direction in
Fig. 9. The relation (15) is conﬁrmed directly in Fig. 11 where we set Γ to be 10. Consequently,
the detailed quasi-balance has one parameter in principle.

We should comment on several separations between θ and (µ1 + 1)/(µ2 + 1) in Fig. 10. An
abrupt jump of Pareto index between 1984 and 1986 (2001 and 2002) is observed in Fig. 6. This
means that the system changes vigorously in this period, where the symmetry is not represented
as the regression line (4). Nevertheless, the dynamical equation (14) is valid in almost all the
other quasistatic periods.

For the next step, we should investigate the dynamical behavior in the middle scale region.
In Ref. [8], it is reported that Pareto index µ changes annually whereas the distributions in the
middle region are stationary in time by analyzing income data for 1983 – 2001 USA. This phe-
nomenon is explained by the Fokker-Planck equation [9] under two assumptions with respect to
the change of income. The middle scale distributions of land prices, however, are not stationary.
The distributions do not collapse onto a single curve by the normalization of the average land
price. This diﬀerence is thought to be caused by the diﬀerence between the trend of increasing

4

(decreasing) income and the trend of increasing (decreasing) land price. In order to study the
dynamical behavior in the middle scale region, we must identify each peculiar feature of middle
scale distributions in the database [10].

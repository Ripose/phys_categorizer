Abstract: Our earlier language model is modiﬁed to allow for the survival of a
minority language without higher status, just because of the pride of its speakers
in their linguistic identity. An appendix studies the roughness of the interface for
linguistic regions when one language conquers the whole territory.
Keywords: Language Competition, Monte Carlo, Quebec.

1 Introduction

Canada is a multicultural country with two oﬃcial languages: English (majority)
and French (minority). How is it possible that the minority language does not die
out even though it has no higher prestige (status) there than the majority language
English? We want to simulate this eﬀect.

Abrams and Strogatz [1] introduced competition between languages in a model
with only two languages, and there the minority language can survive only if it
has a higher status (prestige) than the majority language. With some modiﬁcation
also coexistence is possible [2] but still a status advantage is needed. Other aspects
of language competition were recently reviewed by us [3]. The present work uses
our previous multi-language model [4] to explain a stable survival of one minority
language without an overall status advantage.

2 Model

The model [4] is a variant and generalisation of our earlier bit-string model [3]
and uses Potts variables q = 1, 2, ..., Q instead of merely bits. Each language or
grammar is characterised by F features, and each of these features is an integer
between 1 and Q. Thus we have QF possible languages or grammars.

People sit on L × L square lattices, one person and one language per lattice
Initially each person speaks a randomly selected language. Then, at each
site.
iteration, three processes mutation, transfer and ﬂight happen with probabilities
p, q, r:

Each of the F features is mutated with probability p.

If such a mutation
happens, then with probability 1 − q a random integer between 1 and Q is selected
as the new value for this feature, while with probability q one of the four lattice
neighbours is selected randomly and its value for this feature is transferred to
become the value of this feature for the mutated language.
If the language is
spoken by a fraction x of the whole population, then with probability r(1 − x)2
the simulated person switches its language to that of a randomly selected lattice
neighbour. (In our earlier version [4] this ﬂight away from a small language was
made to the language of a person randomly selected from the whole lattice instead
of from the four neighbours; in that case we do not get coherent language regions.)
Usually, r = 0.9.

As in earlier versions, this model gives a sharp phase transition where the
equilibrium fraction of people speaking the largest language jumps from a small
value to nearly unity, that means the population moves from fragmentation (into
many languages) to dominance (of one language).

We now assume that the speakers of one particular language, which may be
identiﬁed with French in case of Canada, start to defend their language as soon
as the largest llanguage (English) has attracted more than half of the population.
From then on the ﬂight from French to other languages no longer takes place, that
means r = 0 for all French speakers. The other languages (native population,
other European immigrants, ...) continue as usual towards near-extinction.

3 Results

Fig.1 shows the growth of the majority language, and Fig.1b the variation of the
special language (i.e. French);
initially both are spoken by about 0.4 percent
of the population. We see that after slightly more than 1000 iterations, when
English reaches the 50 percent threshold, the French language recovers from its
previous losses and attracts even more people than initially, though it remains less
widespread than English (except perhaps for very long times).

Fig.2 shows for a smaller lattice with 105 instead of 108 sites that French
speaking people form geographically connected clusters, both before and after
English surpasses the 50 percent threshold at t = 244. The French clusters before
this threshold time are much smaller than afterwards.

These simulations were made for small mutation rates p = 0.001, where dom-
inance always emerges independent of q. For larger p, dominance is possible only
for large q, and Fig.3 shows the phase diagram: In the left part (small p or large
q) fragmentation switches over to dominance while in the right part (large p or
small q) fragmentation stays during the observation time of 104 iterations. (Errors
are about 0.02 in q at ﬁxed p and 0.001 in p at ﬁxed q.) We see little qualitative
dependence on these parameters, but the more possible languages we simulate (the
higher F or Q is), the more diﬃcult is the emergence of dominance from the initial

fragmentation. Fig.4 shows unusually large ﬁnite-size eﬀects: Only for L > 82 a
transition to dominance could be seen at p = 0.01; nevertheless a ﬁnite transition
point qc ∼ 0.76 seems plausible for inﬁnitely large lattices. (As a function of ob-
servation time t, at L = 2, F = 8, Q = 2, p = 0.01, r = 0.9 the threshold qc
diminished from 0.65 and 0.56 to 0.52 and 0.48 for t = 103, 104, 105, 106.)

One might envisage a situation when the use of French dies out even after the
ﬂight away from French is stopped. This happened for our parameters if French
had died out already before the ﬂight from French was stopped. Such a situation
is nearly unavoidable for large F , large Q and small L, when there are much more
possible languages QF than people L2.

201 (four samples), with the usual r = 0.9 for the long line and r = 0.5 for
the short line.

4 Conclusion

We modiﬁed our previous multi-language model by allowing ﬂight away from small
languages only to languages spoken by a lattice neighbour, and by switching oﬀ this
ﬂight for one particular language (French) once the dominating language (English)
surpassed a threshold of half of the population. As a result, the French language
did not only survive (if it did not become extinct before) but even could attract
more speakers than at the initial random distribution of the population among all
possible languages.

5 Appendix

The irregular clusters of language domains in Fig.2 are not suited to study sur-
face roughening, familiar to physicists since decades. To study the structure of
the interface between French and the other languages we thus started with the
bottom ﬁve percent of the lattice speaking only French, and omitted the rule that
the French stop switching to English once more than half of the population speaks
English. Because of our initialisation with ﬁve percent, French is the dominating
language anyhow and the no-switch condition is never fulﬁlled. The simulation
now corresponds more to the boundary between a conquering language and native
diﬀerent languages, like in Quebec three centuries ago. Fig.5 shown an interme-
diate example of the growth of French. At the end the border merges with the
upper lattice line and nearly everybody speaks French.

We now deﬁne a width W of the interface region between black and white in
Fig.5 by determining for each column k the highest black place ik where French is
spoken. Then our width is the mean square line number i:

Figure 5: Growth of the region where the dominating language is spoken, at
intermediate times. At the end nearly everybody speaks that language

where H (up to 800) is the height of the L × H lattice. Fig.6 shows for various
parameters the variation of W with L, H, q; that with q is quite small. For our
standard case Q = 2, F = 8 we found a linear increase of W with time until the
ﬁnite height hinders further growth, Fig.6a; for the other parameters Q = 3 and 5,
and F = 16, the log-log plots Fig.6b-d are less clear. Perhaps the First Nations in
Quebec were not interested in the exponents of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation.

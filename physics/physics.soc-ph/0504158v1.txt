The conventional formal tool to detect eﬀects of the ﬁnancial persistence
is in terms of the Hurst exponent. A typical corresponding result is that
its value comes out close to 0.5, as characteristic for geometric Brownian
motion, with at most small departures from this value in either direction
depending on the market and on the time scales involved. We study the
high frequency price changes on the American and on the German stock
markets. For both corresponding indices, the Dow Jones and the DAX
respectively, the Hurst exponent analysis results in values close to 0.5.
However, by decomposing the market dynamics into pairs of steps such
that an elementary move up (down) is followed by another move up (down)
and explicitly counting the resulting conditional probabilities we ﬁnd values
typically close to 60%. This eﬀect of persistence is particularly visible on
the short time scales ranging from 1 up to 3 minutes, decreasing gradually
to 50% and even signiﬁcantly below this value on the larger time scales.
We also detect some asymmetry in persistence related to the moves up
and down, respectively. This indicates a subtle nature of the ﬁnancial
persistence whose characteristics escape detection within the conventional
Hurst exponent formalism.

1. Introduction

The ﬁnancial dynamics results in ﬂuctuations whose nature is, as pointed
out by Bachelier [1] already in 1900, of the Brownian character. By now
we know that it is much more complex and fascinating than just the ordi-
nary Brownian motion. Already the distribution of stock market returns
is far from being Gaussian and at the short time scales large ﬂuctuations
develop heavy power law asymptotics with an exponent α = 3 [2], well
outside the Levy stable regime [3], however. The autocorrelation function
of returns drops down very quickly and after a few minutes it reaches the

(1)

2

noise level. At the same time however the volatility autocorrelation func-
tion decays very slowly with time [3], largely according to the power law,
and remains positive for many months. On a more advanced level of global
quantiﬁcation, the ﬁnancial dynamics appears to be describable in terms of
multifractality both in the transaction-to-transaction price increments and
in the inter-trade waiting times [4]. This indicates a hierarchically convo-
luted self-similar organization of the market dynamics. One related issue
is an eﬀect of persistence. Its commonly adopted measure - the Hurst ex-
ponent - is the mode of each multifractal spectrum. The Hurst exponent,
however, is a global measure while the eﬀects of persistence may in prin-
ciple depend on the market phase. Below we address this issue using the
high-frequency records (years 1998-99) of the two from among the world
leading stock market indices, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) for
the United States and the Deutsche Aktienindex (DAX) for Germany.

2. Conventional methods

There exist two commonly accepted and best-known methods to evaluate
the long-range dependences in the statistical series. The older one is the
so-called rescaled range or R/S analysis [5]. This method originates from
previous hydrological analysis of Hurst [6] and allows to calculate the self-
similarity parameter H. A drawback of this method however is that it may
spuriously detect some apparent long-range correlations that result from
non-stationarity. A method that avoids such artifacts is the Detrended
Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) [7]. In this method one divides a time series
g(ti) of length N (i = 1, ...N ) into M disjoint segments ν of length n and
calculates the signal proﬁle

Yν(i) =

(g(k) − hgi),

i = 1, ..., N

(1)

where h...i denotes the mean. For each segment ν the local trend is then
estimated by least-squares ﬁtting the straight line (in general a polynomial)
˜Yν(i) and the corresponding variance

F 2(ν, n) =

{Y [(ν − 1)n + j] − ˜Y (j)}.

Finally, one calculates the mean value of the root mean square ﬂuctuations
over all the segments ν:

The power-law scaling of the form

¯F (n) ∼ nH

indicates self-similarity and is considered to provide a measure of persis-
tence. If the process is white noise then H = 0.5. If the process is persistent
then H > 0.5; if it is anti-persistent then H < 0.5.
The above procedure applied to the returns

g(t) = ln P (t + ∆t) − ln P (t),

(5)

where P (t) represents the price time series, results in numbers as listed
in the last column of Table 1 for ∆t ranging from 1 min up to 30 min. In
addition to the DAX and the DJIA this Table includes also what for brevity
we here call Nasdaq30 and what for the purpose of this work is constructed
as a simple sum of the prices of 30 high-capitalization companies belonging
to the Nasdaq Composite basket. As one can see from the Table 1, typically
the so-calculated Hurst exponents H point to a trace of anti-persistence but
in fact they do not deviate much from 0.5, especially that an error involved
in estimation equals about 0.4% for ∆t = 1 min and increases up to 1.5%
for ∆t = 30 min due to an eﬀective shortening of the series.

Still this result does not eliminate a possibility that there exist some
more local eﬀect of persistence that simply average out when estimated
from the longer time intervals. In fact, some proposals to calculate the local
counterparts of H, based on variants of DFA, are already present in the
literature [8, 9] and point to such eﬀects indeed. The accuracy of the related
methods is however not yet well established. Furthermore, observations and
experience prompt a possibility that the ﬁnancial persistence may happen
to occur asymmetrically, i.e., a move up may be followed by another move
up more often than a move down by another move down, or vice versa.
Such eﬀects may carry a very valuable information about the dynamics but
remain indistinguishable within the conventional methods and unexplored
so far.
In order therefore to explore a possibility and character of such
eﬀects we return to the very deﬁnition of persistence.

3. Measuring persistence by conditional probabilities

Given a time series of price returns g(ti), where ti denotes the consecutive
equidistant moments of time, to each i we assign +1 if g(ti) is positive (price
goes up), -1 if it is negative (price goes down) and 0 if it happens to be 0
(price remains unchanged). We then explicitly count the number Nα,β of
all the neighboring pairs {g(ti), g(ti+1)} of the type α, β = {−1, 0, +1} for

ﬁxed values of α and β and do so for all the nine combinations of diﬀerent
α and β. Finally, we calculate

pα,β = Nα,β/ X

Nα,β′,

β′=−1,0,+1

(6)

which corresponds to a conditional probability that a return of the type
β is preceded by a return of the type α. This procedure can of course be
performed on any time scale ∆t = ti+1 − ti.

Six combinations of pα,β corresponding to α = ±1 and to all the three
possible values of β are listed in Table 1 for several values of ∆t starting
from 1 up to 30 min.

Quite interestingly - and somewhat unexpectedly in view of the corre-
sponding values of the Hurst exponents (last column in Table 1) that are

5

very close to 0.5 like for the white noise - both the DAX and the DJIA
show signiﬁcant eﬀects of persistence on the small time scales. A move up
(down) is followed by another move up (down) signiﬁcantly more often than
by a move in opposite direction. For ∆t larger than 5-10 min we observe a
crossover: the ﬂuctuations become anti-persistent and, what is particularly
interesting, this eﬀect is visibly asymmetric towards moves down as a sys-
tematically observed relation p−1,−1 and p+1,+1 indicates. For the basket of
the Nasdaq stocks this crossover also takes place, though on the somewhat
larger time scales. Quite interestingly - and somewhat unexpectedly in view
of the corresponding values of the Hurst exponents (last column in Table
1) that are very close to 0.5 like for the white noise - both the DAX and
the DJIA show signiﬁcant eﬀects of persistence on the small time scales. A
move up (down) is followed by another move up (down) signiﬁcantly more
often than by a move in opposite direction. For ∆t larger than 5-10 min
we observe a crossover: the ﬂuctuations become anti-persistent and, what
is particularly interesting, this eﬀect is visibly asymmetric towards moves
down as a systematically observed relation p−1,−1 and p+1,+1 indicates. For
the basket of the Nasdaq stocks this crossover also takes place, though on
the somewhat larger time scales.

The time period (01.12.1997 - 31.12.1999) of the stock market variability
studied here displays a richness of phases. In the ﬁrst half of this period it
for instance includes a spectacular draw up (DAX more than 50%) followed
by an even faster draw down to the original level. Previous study [10] based
on the correlation matrix formalism provides a serious indication that the
dynamics of long-term stock market increases is more competitive and less
collective (as far as correlations among the individual stocks forming an
index is concerned) than during long-term decreases.

It is thus interesting to inspect if and how our indicators of persistence
correlate with the diﬀerent phases of the market dynamics. Two principal
such coeﬃcients (rectangles), p+1,+1 and p−1,−1, calculated for ∆t = 1 min
over one trading day time intervals for all the consecutive days covering our
01.12.1997 - 31.12.1999 time period, versus the corresponding DAX changes
are shown in Fig. 1. The correlation is visible indeed.

The long-term increases systematically lead to a decrease of persistence
both in p+1,+1 and in p−1,−1. A sharp increase of the DAX in the end of
the period here analyzed pulls these two coeﬃcients even below 0.5. On
the contrary, the decreases are seen to be lifting our persistency coeﬃcients
up to as high as ∼ 0.7. Even more, changes of the trend in p+1,+1 and
p−1,−1 are somewhat shifted in phase relative to each other which is another
manifestation of asymmetry in persistence. That all such eﬀects may reﬂect
a general logic of the stock market dynamics can be seen also from Fig. 2
which displays the same quantities for the DJIA in the same period of time

6

and qualitatively analogous correlations can be postulated.

More focus on this last issue is given in Figs. 3 and 4 and the corre-
sponding Tables 2 and 3. Two sizable periods of the global market in-
creases and decreases, respectively, both for the DAX and for the DJIA, are
here extracted and the corresponding conditional probability coeﬃcients
pα,β calculated for those periods separately. Again one sees that the re-
lated ﬂuctuations are persistent and that these persistency eﬀects are even
stronger during decreases. Furthermore, even during the same market phase
(either global increase or decrease) the asymmetry in persistence between
the moves up and down may occur.

4. Conclusion

The above observations are intriguing and of course demand a much
more systematic study as they carry a potential to shed more light on mech-
anism of the stock market dynamics. The present study however already in-
dicates direction concerning this speciﬁc issue. There deﬁnitely exist higher
order correlations in the ﬁnancial dynamics that escape detection within
the conventional methods.
In this connection the wavelet based formal-
ism, due to its ability to focus on local eﬀects, seems to oﬀer a promising
frame to develop consistent related methodology, such that a link to mul-
tifractality perhaps can also be traced. The wavelet based formalism can
also be generalised to account for the asymmetry in persistence - an eﬀect
identiﬁed above. Finally and ultimately, one needs to develop a realistic
theoretical model of the ﬁnancial dynamics such that also the above eﬀects
can be incorporated. A variant of the generalised Weierstrass random walk
as developed by Kutner [11] may appear an appropriate solution especially
that the Weierstrass-type functions may incorporate log-periodicaly a kind
correlations that underlay the ﬁnancial dynamics [12, 13].

We present a detailed study on the mean ﬁrst-passage time of volatility processes. We analyze the
theoretical expressions based on the most common stochastic volatility models along with empirical
results extracted from daily data of major ﬁnancial indices. We ﬁnd in all these data sets a very
similar behavior that is far from being that of a simple Wiener process.
It seems necessary to
include a framework like the one provided by stochastic volatility models with a reverting force
driving volatility toward its normal level to take into account memory and clustering eﬀects in
volatility dynamics. We also detect in data a very diﬀerent behavior in the mean ﬁrst-passage time
depending whether the level is higher or lower than the normal level of volatility. For this reason, we
discuss asymptotic approximations and confront them to empirical results with a good agreement,
specially with the ExpOU model.

I.

INTRODUCTION

In the quantitative study of ﬁnancial markets the
volatility, originally deﬁned as the standard deviation of
returns, plays an increasingly important role as a cru-
cial measure of risk. There are nowadays many ﬁnancial
products, such as options and other ﬁnancial derivatives,
which are speciﬁcally designed to cover investors from the
risk associated with any market activity. These products
are fundamentally based on the volatility, therefore, its
knowledge turns out to be essential in any modern ﬁnan-
cial setting and, hence, in any ﬁnancial modeling.

One of the earliest ﬁnancial models, the model of
Einstein-Bachelier [1], assumes that the volatility is con-
stant being itself the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of a Wiener pro-
cess. However this assumption is questioned by many
empirical observations, the so-called “stylized facts” [2].
The overall conclusion is that the volatility is not con-
stant, it is not even a function of time but a random
variable. Consequently the measure of volatility has be-
come more diﬃcult and questions like at what time the
volatility reaches, for the ﬁrst time, a determined value
– which may be extreme– are quite relevant.

The main objective of this paper is to study the mean
ﬁrst-passage time (MFPT) of the volatility process. We
will approach the problem both from analytical and em-
pirical viewpoints. We will thus analyze the MFPT for
daily data of major ﬁnancial indices and compare it with
the theoretical predictions of the most common volatility
models. This will, in turn, provide an indirect test about
the suitability of these analytical models.

Previous works on extreme times in ﬁnance are, to our
knowledge, scarce and mostly dealing with the return
process but not with volatility. In our early works [3, 4]
we have analyzed the mean exit time (MET) of the re-
turn based on the continuous random walk technique and
addressed exclusively to tick-by-tick data. Other exam-
ples studying the extreme time return statistics are given
in [5] and specially [6] where the MET is simulated us-

ing an stochastic volatility model as underlying process.
And ﬁnally, there are also recent studies focused on the
volatility data analyzing the interevent time statistics be-
tween spikes [7, 8] or the survival probability comparing
the high frequency empirics with the results from multi-
fractal modeling [9, 10].

We end this introductory section by pointing out that
the analysis of extreme times is closely related with at
least two challenging problems in mathematical ﬁnance
which are of great practical interest: the American op-
tion pricing [11, 12] and the issue of default times and
credit risk [13, 14]. Both problems require the knowl-
edge of hitting times, that is, ﬁrst-passage times to cer-
tain thresholds.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. II we outline
the most usual stochastic volatility models. In Sect. III
we obtain the general expressions for the MFPT based
on these models.
In Sect. IV we analyze the averaged
extreme time and examine its asymptotic behavior. In
Sect. V we estimate the empirical MFPT of several ﬁnan-
cial indices and compare it with the analytic expressions
obtained in previous sections. Conclusions are drawn in
Sect. VI and some more technical details are left to Ap-
pendices.

II. STOCHASTIC VOLATILITY MODELS

The geometric Brownian motion (GBM) proposed by
physicist Osborne in 1959 [15] is, without any doubt, the
most widely used model in ﬁnance. In this setting spec-
ulative prices S(t) are described through the following
Langevin equation (in Itˆo sense)

dS(t)
S(t)

= µdt + σ dW1(t),

(1)

where σ is the volatility, assumed to be constant, µ is
some deterministic drift indicating an eventual trend in
the market, and W1(t) is the Wiener process. However,

and particularly after the 1987 crash, there is a com-
pelling empirical evidence that the assumption of con-
stant volatility is doubtful [2, 16], neither it is a determin-
istic function of time (as one might wonder on account
of the non stationarity of ﬁnancial data) but a random
variable.

The assumption of a random volatility was originally
suggested to explain the so-called “smile eﬀect” appear-
ing in the implicit volatility of option prices [17].
In
the most general frame one therefore assumes that the
volatility σ is a given function of a random process Y (t):

σ(t) = σ(Y (t)).

(2)

The volatility is often related to the market activ-
ity [18].
In this way we are assuming that market ac-
tivity is stochastic and governed by the random arrival
of information to the markets. Most stochastic volatility
(SV) models that have been proposed up till now suppose
that Y (t) is also a diﬀusion process that may or may not
be correlated with price, and diﬀerent models diﬀer from
each other, among other diﬀerences, in the way that σ
depends on Y (t).

The usual starting point of the SV models is the GBM
given by Eq. (1) with σ given by Eq. (2) and Y (t) being
a diﬀusion process:

hence

dY (t) =

αY dt +

dW2(t).

(7)

−

k
m

See Refs. [24, 25] for further details.

From the above equations we see that the volatility is

also described by a one-dimensional diﬀusion process:

dσ(t) = f (σ)dt + g(σ)dW (t).

(8)

Thus, for the OU model σ = Y and (see Eq. (5)):

dσ(t) =

α(σ

m)dt + kdW (t).

(9)

−

−

However, obtaining a diﬀerential equation for σ(t) for
CIR-Heston and ExpOU models is not direct, since in
these cases the volatility, σ = σ(Y ), is a nonlinear func-
tion of processes Y and the diﬀerentials of σ and Y are
connected through Itˆo’s lemma [26, 27]:

dσ(Y ) =

dY +

dY (t) = F (Y )dt + G(Y )dW2(t).

In this section and the next, we study the MFPT of
the volatility process from an analytical point of view.
We postpone for a later section, Sect. V, the analysis
of empirical mean ﬁrst-passage times for several markets
and their comparison with the analytical expressions ob-
tained in Sects. III-IV.

Let us denote by Tλ(σ) the MFPT of the volatility
process. That is, Tλ(σ) represents the mean time one has
to wait in order to observe the volatility, starting from
a known value σ, to reach for the ﬁrst time a prescribed
value λ, which we often refer to as the “critical level”.

If we assume that the volatility is given by the diﬀu-
sion process described in Eq. (8), then Tλ(σ) obeys the
following diﬀerential equation [27]

with an absorbing boundary condition at the critical
level:

and

Tλ(λ) = 0.

(16)

We notice at this point that the volatility should be a
positive deﬁned quantity. Hence, we have also to impose
a reﬂection when the volatility reaches the value σ = 0.
We thus add the reﬂecting boundary condition

ψ(x) =

2µ2x2 + 4mµ2 ln x.

IV. THE AVERAGED MFPT

The expressions for Tλ(σ) developed in the previous
section give us the mean time one has to wait until the
volatility reaches a given level λ from its present value σ.

However, it is also of theoretical and practical interest [3,
4, 29] the knowledge of the averaged MFPT in which the
dependence on σ has been averaged out. To obtain this
quantity we have to choose a probability distribution for
σ. The simplest and most common assumption takes the
present value of the volatility as uniformly distributed
over the interval (0, λ). We thus deﬁne

T (λ)

≡

Tλ(σ)dσ.

(32)

We can easily obtain T (λ) for the SV models discussed
above. This is done at once by substituting into Eq. (32)
the expressions of Tλ(σ) given by these models. For the
OU, CIR-Heston and ExpOU models (cf. Eqs. (23), (27)
and (31)) this replacement, followed by an integration by
parts, yields respectively

Equations (33) and (34) are the ﬁnal expressions of
the averaged MFPT for the OU and CIR-Heston mod-
els. The expression given by Eq. (35), corresponding to
the ExpOU model needs, nonetheless, some further trans-
formations which will show their usefulness both in the
asymptotic and empirical analyses to be undertaken be-
low. Thus, in Eq. (35) we change the variable x

A. Scaling the volatility critical level

Before proceeding with the asymptotic analysis of the
above expressions of T (λ), it is convenient to scale λ so
as to render it dimensionless. This will also be useful for
the empirical analysis of the next section.

In ﬁnance, it is rather relevant the knowledge of the
so-called “volatility’s normal level”, σs, which is deﬁned
as the mean stationary value of the volatility process:
∞

σs =

σpst(σ)dσ,

(37)

−∞

Z

where pst(σ) is the stationary probability density func-
tion (pdf) of the volatility random process. The signiﬁ-
cance of σs lies in the empirical fact that the volatility is,
as time increases, mean reverting to its normal level [2].
We therefore scale the critical level λ with the normal

level, and deﬁne

L

≡

λ
σs

.

From the analytical view, the dimensionless critical value
L depends on the SV model we choose. The calculation
of σs for diﬀerent SV models is given in Appendix A with
the result:

where

Once we know the normal level, substituting λ in terms
of L into Eqs. (33), (34) and (36) result in the following
expressions for the averaged MFPT:

Note that T (L) behaves, as L

depending on the SV model chosen. While in OU and
CIR-Heston models, the averaged MFPT grows quadrat-
ically with L; in the ExpOU model it grows logarith-
mically –a similar situation arises for large values of L,
see below. We will return to this point in the following
sections.

C. Asymptotic analysis of the MFPT for large
values of the critical level

Let us now address the case L

1 when the critical
level is much greater than the normal level. In the Ap-
pendix B we show that an asymptotic representation of
T (λ) for large values of λ and regardless the SV model
chosen it is given by

V. EMPIRICAL RESULTS

We now present an empirical study of the MFPT
for the daily volatility of major ﬁnancial indices:
(1)
Dow-Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). (2) Standard and
(3) German index DAX. (4)
Poor’s-500 (S&P-500).
Japanese index NIKKEI. (5) American index NASDAQ.
(6) British index FTSE-100. (7) Spanish index IBEX-35.
(8) French index CAC-40 (see Table I for more details).
The experimental MFPT that we will obtain is the av-
eraged MFPT and will see its behavior in terms of the
critical value. We work with the dimensionless level L
deﬁned in Eq. (38) so that we ﬁrst need to know from
data the volatility’s normal level, σs, of each market (see
Table I for the empirical values of σs). In this way we deal
with critical levels that are proportional to the speciﬁc
normal level of every market and thus unify the magni-
tudes involved in the MFPT computation.

From the time series of all the indices shown in Table I
we have to extract ﬁrst the daily volatility and then eval-
uate the averaged MFPT for many values of L. Before
proceeding further we observe that, in fact, the volatility
is never directly observed. In practice, one usually takes
as an approximate measure of the instantaneous volatil-
ity (over the time step ∆t assumed to be one day in our
case) the quantity

σ(t)

where ∆X(t) is the daily zero-mean return change de-
ﬁned in terms of the current price as follows

Let us justify the measure of σ(t) given by Eq. (54).
Using Eq. (1) as the evolution equation of S(t), one can
easily see that Eq. (55) yields [30]

The procedure just outlined is not the only one to
provide a mean of obtaining the empirical value of the
volatility. There is, at least, another relatively simple
way of extracting it from the time series of prices [25].
This alternative method basically consists in dividing the
empirical ∆X(t) –obtained through Eq. (55)– by a sim-
ulated Gaussian process mimicking the Wiener process
W (t). This, after using Eq. (56), yields an empirical value
for σ(t). We have shown in [25] that such a “deconvolu-
tion procedure” works relatively well and it reproduces
reliable values of the empirical volatility as long as the
eﬀects of memory and cross-correlation are negligible (or,
at least, that they do not aﬀect the statistical analysis).
However, in the analysis of extreme times the deconvolu-
tion method may destroy many subtleties of the MFPT
curves.
In this case, as we will see below, the market
memory seems to really matter.

Once we have a volatility time series constructed us-
ing Eq. (54), we can compute the mean ﬁrst-passage
time [32].
In Fig. 1 we present the log-log representa-
tion of the empirical T (L) in terms of L for the markets
outlined in Table I. We observe that the MFPT behaves
in a very similar way for all markets and universality is
well-sustained. In the same plot we have added several
curves. The solid one gives the MFPT for the pure Brow-
nian volatility process dσ = kdW (t). From Eqs. (18)
and (32), it can be easily seen that if we represent the
volatility by the Wiener process –that is, f (σ) = 0 and
L2. Clearly, this behavior is
g(σ) = k– we get T (L)
not observed in real data. It seems to be necessary to
include a non constant driving force in the drift that in
turn provides memory and clustering to the volatility dy-
namics. Moreover, we can obtain a diﬀerent power law,
of the form T (L)
1 or
1 (cf Fig. 1).

We also note that the range where statistics is reli-
able enough appears to be between 0.01 and 10 times
the normal level. The index with less statistics is the
CAC-40 which is in fact the market with a lower data
amount. The more reliable data statistics is that of the
Dow Jones which allows us to look at data below 0.01
and far beyond 10 times its normal level.

We have further estimated the empirical MFPT of sev-

American DJIA to the French CAC-40 and also for dif-
ferent periods of time (see Table I)– the empirical MFPT
has a very similar behavior (see Fig. 1) which sustains
the assumed general random character of the volatility.
Moreover, we have also ﬁtted the above asymptotic ap-
proximations provided by SV models to the empirical
data (see Figs. 2-5), with the overall result that the Ex-
pOU model better explains the experimental MFPT than
OU and CIR-Heston models, specially for large values of
the critical level.

VI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

APPENDIX A: THE NORMAL LEVEL OF
VOLATILITY

We have studied an aspect of the volatility process
which is closely related with risk management:
its ex-
treme times. Using the most prevailing SV models, that
is: OU, CIR-Heston and ExpOU models, we have ob-
tained closed expressions (up to a quadrature) for the
MFPT to a certain “critical” level, Tλ(σ), where σ is
the current value of the volatility and λ the critical level
(Eqs. (23), (27) and (31)). By averaging out the current
value of the volatility we have also obtained the aver-
aged MFPT, T (L), where L is a dimensionless level rep-
resenting the proportion to the normal level of volatility
(Eqs. (38)-(43)).

Obviously diﬀerent SV models furnish diﬀerent expres-
sions for the MFPT. However, the expressions obtained
from OU and CIR-Heston models show a similar behav-
ior while that of the ExpOU model is distinctive. This
is clearly seen by asymptotic analysis. Thus, both OU

We know that the normal level of volatility, σs, is de-
ﬁned as the mean stationary value of the volatility pro-
cess σ(t):

σs =

σpst(σ)dσ,

where pst(σ) is the stationary pdf of σ(t). For SV
models the volatility process is determined by the one-
dimensional diﬀusion given in Eq. (8), in this case the
stationary distribution is explicitly given by [27]

extremes of ψ(x), and from Eq. (19) we see that the ex-
treme points of ψ(x) are those in which the drift f (x) = 0
vanishes. Therefore, for all SV models here analyzed,

Note that for λ large enough (in fact larger than the
maximum value of m, √m and M ) xm lies inside the
interval (0, λ). Moreover, xm is a maximum since the
second derivative ψ′′(x) = 2f ′(x)/g2(x) < 0 is negative
for all models.

APPENDIX B: ASYMPTOTIC
APPROXIMATIONS

In this appendix we will prove that a convenient
asymptotic representation of the averaged MFPT, for
large values of the critical level, is given by Eq. (49).

The starting point of our derivation is the general ex-
pression of the MFPT given by Eq. (18). We introduce
this expression into the deﬁnition of the averaged MFPT
given in Eq. (32) and then exchange the order in which
the double integral is performed. We have

T (λ) =

paper, the function

suﬃciently large, is inside the integration interval (0, λ)

The fact that the function χ(x) = eψ(x) reaches its
maximum value inside the integration interval (0, λ) of
Eq. (B3) allows us to apply Laplace’s method for the
approximate evaluation of the integral [33]. Expanding
ψ(x) around xm

analysis would be model dependent and more compli-
cated. Indeed, by considering Itˆo lemma we have

which depends on the volatility and hence on the SV
model chosen. We have nonetheless compared the results
for the MFPT using these two ways of deﬁning the return
and we have not seen any signiﬁcant diﬀerence.

[31] This procedure of extracting σ from data furnishes only
a “proxy” of the true value of the volatility. There might
be more accurate analyses to obtain this value but any
of these methods needs to assume an speciﬁc SV model
which is one thing we want to avoid. In any case, the
eﬀort is far beyond the scope of this paper and we leave
it for future future research.

[32] We ﬁrst estimate the MFPT Tλ(σ) starting from a known
value σ and raising the critical level λ. For each critical
level we take 200 boxes of the same width. For each box
and each critical level we perform an average over the
whole time series that allows us to get Tλ(σ). Afterwards
for each critical level we average uniformly over all ini-
tial boxes and thus obtain the desired averaged MFPT
given by Eq. (32). We perform all these computations
for 50 diﬀerent levels both linear and logarithmically dis-
tributed between 0.001 until 100 times the normal level
of volatility for the eight indices (see Table I). The num-
ber of boxes and the number of levels have been chosen
to be neither too big and nor too small. We get a reli-
able statistics having in all cases a small enough number
of boxes to get a suﬃcient number of events inside each
box and a large enough number of boxes for getting a
good estimation of the averaged MFPT.

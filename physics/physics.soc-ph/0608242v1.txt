On the volatility of volatility

Stephen D. H. Hsu∗ and Brian M. Murray†

Institute of Theoretical Science, University of Oregon, Eugene OR 94703-5203

The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Volatility Index, VIX, is calculated based

on prices of out-of-the-money put and call options on the S&P 500 index (SPX). Sometimes

called the “investor fear gauge,” the VIX is a measure of the implied volatility of the SPX,

and is observed to be correlated with the 30-day realized volatility of the SPX. Changes

in the VIX are observed to be negatively correlated with changes in the SPX. However,

no signiﬁcant correlation between changes in the VIX and changes in the 30-day realized

volatility of the SPX are observed. We investigate whether this indicates a mispricing of

options following large VIX moves, and examine the relation to excess returns from variance

swaps.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Volatility is a fundamental characteristic of ﬁnancial markets. Although a derived quantity,

describing the propensity of prices to ﬂuctuate, it plays an important role in options pricing and

in any simple characterization of market dynamics. In Ref. [1] Demeterﬁ, et al. list three reasons

for trading volatility. The ﬁrst two involve direct speculation on the future level of stock or index

volatility. First, one may, due to a particular directional view, simply want to be long or short

volatility. Second, one may want to speculate on the spread between realized and implied volatility.

Third, one may want to be long volatility as a hedge against other portfolio components which

are eﬀectively short volatility. For example, equity fund investors following active benchmarking

strategies, portfolio managers who are judged against a benchmark, and risk arbitrageurs are all

implicitly short volatility. Due to their various circumstances, every one of these types of market

participants could stand to beneﬁt, if they could somehow add to their portfolios a long position

on volatility.

Volatility swaps provide just such an opportunity. There is no cost to enter these contracts.

The payoﬀ on the long side is equal to the realized (annualized) volatility over the life of the

contract minus a ﬁxed annualized volatility (the delivery or strike price) times a notional amount

of the swap in dollars per annualized volatility point. Due to the square root relationship between

volatility and variance, and the more fundamental theoretical signiﬁcance of variance, it turns out

to be easier to eﬀectively price and hedge variance swaps than volatility swaps. Therefore, we will

primarily focus our attention on variance swaps.

In order to replicate a variance swap, one needs to hold a portfolio consisting of a particular

distribution of options on the underlying [1]. On September 22, 2003, the Chicago Board Options

Exchange (CBOE) introduced the new CBOE Volatility Index (VIX). The new VIX replaced an

older volatility index that had a problematic deﬁnition, and which will not be discussed further

here. The new VIX calculation is based on the prices of a batch of out-of-the-money and near-

the-money put and call options on the S&P 500 index (SPX). Indeed, the VIX has a very concrete

economic meaning: it is the simply the price of a linear portfolio of options. The square of the VIX

is the variance swap rate up to corrections due to the fact that there are only SPX options at a ﬁnite

number of strikes, as well as the fact that there are occasional jumps in the underlying (SPX).

Put another way, the square of the VIX is approximately equal to the risk-neutral expectation

of the annualized return variance over the next 30 days, up to the corrections mentioned above

[2]. Interestingly, Carr and Wu [2] show that adding information from a GARCH process to the

information contained in the VIX does not lead to a better prediction of the return variance than

using the VIX alone.

Therefore, it is logical to deﬁne 30-day variance swaps on the SPX as contracts that depend

on the diﬀerence between the realized variance and the square of the VIX. It is well known that
implied volatilities are typically larger than realized volatilities1. As the VIX is an implied volatility

of sorts (again, it is calculated based on option prices; the Black-Scholes equation [3] is not used),

one might guess that shorting variance swaps on the SPX may be a successful investment strategy.

Indeed, Carr and Wu [2] verify that this is the case. But who would want to be on the long side of

these contracts? As mentioned above, there are a number of market participants who are implicitly

short volatility. Perhaps the most common example is an equity fund. Over short timescales index

levels and implied volatility are often negatively correlated (this is not the case over long timescales,

however). An investor whose portfolio consists primarily of equities is willing to pay a premium to

1 Implied volatility which is systematically larger than realized volatility would seem to provide a risk-free arbitrage,
since it means all options contracts are overpriced. In an idealized world of log-normal price ﬂuctuations, a trader
could sell options contracts and hedge away the risk by holding cash and the underlying. However, in the real
world, where volatility is itself volatile, there is no foolproof way to completely hedge away the risk of selling an
option. An option seller is paid a premium to bear this risk, namely the systematic diﬀerence between implied
and realized volatilities.

3

be on the long side of a variance swap. This is analogous to insurance, where the party on the long

side of the contract is happy to pay a relatively small premium over an extended period of time,

with the assurance that if something goes wrong (i.e., the SPX crashes in the case of a variance

swap, one’s house burns down in the case of an insurance policy), they will be compensated for

their loss because they are long variance (or long an insurance policy).

It is rather striking that there is often a negative correlation between changes in implied volatility

and changes in the underlying. This implies a non-trivial memory in price dynamics which goes

beyond the most naive (i.e., log-normal) models. Black [4] ﬁrst proposed the “leverage eﬀect” as a

possible explanation of this negative correlation. The idea is essentially that at a ﬁxed level of debt,

a decline in equity level increases the leverage and therefore the risk for which implied volatility is

a proxy. However, this mechanism is probably too small to explain the entire eﬀect, at least in the

case of the SPX, where a one percent change in the index causes a roughly negative four percent

change in the implied volatility. Other possible explanations include put gouging (when the market

has moved down, and demand for insurance is high) and call overwriting (when markets are up).

The plan of this article is as follows. In Sec. II correlations between the SPX, the VIX, and the

30-day realized volatility are examined, as are correlations between changes in these quantities. We

note that there is no signiﬁcant correlation between changes in the VIX and changes in the 30-day

realized volatility. This suggests that, at least in theory, some options are mispriced after large

moves in the index. In Sec. III we brieﬂy discus the behavior of the volatility surface on days when

there is a large change in the VIX and the SPX. In Sec. IV we examine shorting variance swaps on

the SPX as in Carr and Wu [2]. We investigate a trading strategy in which a large change in the

VIX is used as a signal for selectively shorting variance swaps. The lack of correlation identiﬁed

in Sec. II between changes in the VIX and changes in the 30-day realized volatility suggests that

this strategy would outperform simply continuously shorting variance swaps. However, because

of the large premium (excess return) associated with variance swaps, the additional advantage is

relatively small. Finally, we summarize our results in Sec. V.

IMPLIED, REALIZED, AND THE UNDERLYING

The sample period for calculating the 30-day realized volatility RVolt,t+30 (deﬁned below) con-

sists of 4178 trading days from 2 Jan 1990 to 31 Jul 2006. For the SPX and the VIX, we use 4157

trading days, from 2 Jan 1990 to 29 Jun 2006. SPX and VIX data were obtained from Yahoo

Finance.

level of correlation is observed between the realized and implied volatilities.

A. The SPX, the VIX, and realized volatility

We deﬁne the 30-day realized volatility as follows:

RVolt,t+30 = 100 × v
u
u

As is common practice, we use a deﬁnition which assumes zero mean.

We use the standard deﬁnition of the correlation between two time series Xt and Yt consisting

of n points xi and yi, respectively:

Cor (Xt, Yt) =

n
i=1(xi − ¯x)(yi − ¯y)
(n − 1)sxsy

,

P

where ¯x and ¯y are the usual sample means, and sx and sy are the usual sample standard deviations.

We ﬁnd a signiﬁcant correlation between the VIX and the 30-day realized volatility:

Cor (VIXt, RVolt,t+30) = 0.76.

Scatter plots of combinations of the VIX, the 30-day realized volatility, and the SPX are shown

in Figs. 1, 2, and 3. The correlations between the SPX and both realized and implied volatilities

are not signiﬁcant over long timescale of our sample (16 and a half years).

correlation between the indexes is observed.

B. Changes in the SPX, the VIX, and realized volatility

In order to examine correlations between changes in the indexes, we make the following deﬁni-

tions:

CSPXt =

CVIXt =

SPXt − SPXt−1
SPXt−1
VIXt − VIXt−1
VIXt−1

.

Cor (CVIXt, CSPXt) = −0.66.

There is a signiﬁcant negative correlation between changes in the VIX and changes in the SPX:

See Fig. 4 for a scatter plot of CVIXt versus CSPXt. Note that this negative correlation is inter-

esting, as it implies that there is a non-trivial memory in price dynamics which goes beyond the

most naive (i.e., log-normal) models.

In order to examine the correlation between changes in the VIX and changes in the 30-day

realized volatility, we must ﬁrst ﬁnd a suitable deﬁnition for the change in the 30-day realized

volatility. To this end, we deﬁne:

CRVolt =

RVolt,t+30 − RVolt−31,t−1
RVolt−31,t−1

.

(6)

This quantity compares the 30-day realized volatility of the 30-day time period ending at time
to time t − 1 with that of the 30-day time period beginning at time t. It is an appropriate way

of measuring the change in the 30-day realized volatility because it compares volatilities of two

independent neighboring time periods. However, it remains true that CRVolt and CRVolt+1 are

not independent. Therefore, in estimating the correlation between the change in the VIX and the

change in the 30-day realized volatility, it would not be appropriate to simply compare the two time

series CRVolt and CVIXt. Instead, we compare the correlation between CRVols+30t and CVIXs+30t

for all oﬀsets s with 0 < s < 30. All 21 such time series consist of 196 days (there are 21 trading

days for every 30 calendar days). See Fig. 5 for a scatter plot of CRVols+30t versus CVIXs+30t for

the case s = 2, i.e., the ﬁrst change in the 30-day realized volatility considered is between the 30

days prior to and the 30 days following 5 Feb 1990. For this choice of oﬀset, the correlation is

typical of the values obtained for all values of s, with a value of 0.13.

Change in SPX

FIG. 4: Change in the VIX versus change in the SPX for 2 Jan 1990 to 29 Jun 2006. Changes in the indexes

have a signiﬁcant level of negative correlation.

A histogram of the correlations for all possible values of oﬀset s is shown in Fig. 6. Each of

the 21 correlations computed is correlating two time series (CVIXt and CRVolt) of 196 days each.

With a mean correlation of 0.11 and a standard deviation of the correlations of 0.06, it is clear

that a change in the VIX does not predict a change in the 30-day realized volatility of the SPX.

III. THE BEHAVIOR OF IMPLIED VOLATILITY

In order to try to determine the cause of the negative correlation between changes in the SPX

and changes in the VIX, we obtained closing prices for near-the-money SPX put and call options

on the days immediately before and the days of the four largest VIX increases and four largest

VIX decreases of 2005 and 2006. The data were obtained from Bloomberg.

In Figs. 7 and 8 we plot option price versus the ratio of strike price to index level for both puts

and calls the day before and the day of one of the largest VIX increases and decreases, respectively,

of 2006. As expected, both puts and calls at a given distance from at-the-money become more

expensive when VIX increases and less expensive when VIX decreases.

Change in VIX

FIG. 5: Change in the 30-day realized volatility versus change in the VIX for non-overlapping intervals from

1 Feb 1990 to 29 Jun 2006. With a correlation of 0.13, this dataset (s = 2, see text) provides a typical

example of the lack of correlation between changes in the VIX and changes in the 30-day realized volatility.

See Fig. 6 for a histogram of the correlations for all possible choices of the oﬀset s.

Similarly, the volatility surface is plotted in Figs. 9 and 10. Although we see that, as expected,

Black-Scholes implied volatility increases or decreases when the VIX does, it is diﬃcult to comment

as to why the VIX is changing, i.e., which particular options are causing the VIX to increase or

decrease. Also, we see roughly linear volatility skews, as have been present in many indexes, since

the 1987 crash.

Without much more data, we cannot say which options cause the VIX to change. Put gouging,

call overwriting or Black’s “leverage eﬀect” may be at work here, but we cannot say with any

certainty. It would be interesting to further investigate the volatility surface.

IV. TRADING REALIZED AND IMPLIED VOLATILITY

As stated in Sec. I, the VIX has a concrete economic meaning: its square is the variance swap

rate up to corrections due to the fact that there are only SPX options at a ﬁnite number of strikes,

as well as the fact that there are occasional jumps in the underlying (the SPX). In Ref. [2], Carr

and Wu use this fact to determine the excess returns that would have been gained from shorting

variance swaps on every day of the sample period, where the excess return is deﬁned as:

ERt,t+30 = 100 ×

VIX2
t

− RVol2
VIX2
t

t,t+30

.

(7)

See Figs. 11 and 12 for a time series and a histogram, respectively, of the excess returns.

It is worth emphasizing the fact that the mean excess return gained from continuously shorting

variance swaps is large, at nearly 40 percent. Why is this premium so large? In order to answer this

question, one must take into account that the distribution of excess returns is heavily skewed; there

are a number of occurrences of very large negative excess return. As discussed in Sec. I, parties on

the long side of variance swaps are willing to pay a high premium for the insurance provided against

periods of high realized volatility (relative to the VIX). Whether they are portfolio managers who

are judged against a benchmark, equity funds or others, they are eﬀectively short volatility, and

are therefore willing to pay for the insurance that variance swaps provide. Interestingly, Carr and

Wu [2] argue that the CAPM cannot fully account for the size of the excess return associated with

variance swaps. This perhaps indicates an ineﬃciency or mispricing in this market.

FIG. 7: Closing prices for put and call options on the SPX on the day immediately before and the day of a

In Sec. II B it was shown that there is no correlation between changes in the VIX and changes in

the 30-day realized volatility of the SPX. This means that the excess returns gained from shorting

30-day variance swaps would increase if the swaps are shorted only on days when there is a large

increase in the VIX as opposed to every day as in Carr and Wu [2]. This is true because a change

in the VIX does not predict a change in the 30-day realized volatility. Therefore, on average the

payoﬀ from shorting the swap will be higher when the VIX has recently increased. The opposite

should be true as well: shorting swaps only on days when there is a large decrease in the VIX

should lead to a decrease in the excess returns.

Table I shows the average excess return ER, the standard deviation of the excess returns sER,

and the ratio of the two for various trading strategies. As predicted based on the independence

of changes in the VIX relative to changes in the 30-day realized volatility, we see that strategies

involving the shorting of 30-day variance swaps only on days when there is a large increase in the

VIX slightly outperform a strategy in which the swaps are shorted on every day, while shorting

only on days when the VIX experiences a large decrease does worse.

The eﬀect, however, appears to be small. Presumably, this is the case because the average

excess return is so large for the simplest trading strategy in which the swaps are shorted every

increases, the relative improvement in the average excess return does not appear to be signiﬁcant.

In addition, we considered the possibility of further restricting the trading strategy such that one

is only engaged in one swap contract at a time. Again, such a strategy does not do signiﬁcantly

better than the strategy of shorting every day.

V. CONCLUSION

We investigated a number of features of implied and realized volatility of the SPX index. Sec. II

examines correlations between the SPX, the VIX, and the 30-day realized volatility of the SPX, as

well as between changes in these quantities. We conﬁrmed that the VIX and the 30-day realized

volatility are correlated, and that while changes in the SPX are negatively correlated with changes

in the VIX, the levels of the two indexes are not correlated over the nearly 16 years of data that

we analyzed (although they may be negatively correlated on shorter timescales). Interestingly, as

shown in Fig. 6, we found no signiﬁcant correlation between changes in the VIX and changes in

the 30-day realized volatility of the SPX. This means that short term changes in the VIX do not

correctly predict the actual realized volatility, and suggests that at least some options are mispriced

after large moves in the index.

The details of the negative correlation between changes in the SPX and changes in the VIX

were addressed in Sec. III. Without a large dataset of historical options prices, it is diﬃcult to

identify the cause of the negative correlation between changes in the SPX and changes in the VIX.

To this end, it would be interesting to examine the volatility surface in more detail on days with

large market moves.

We returned to the issue of correlation between realized and implied volatility in Sec. IV. We

began by reproducing the analysis of Carr and Wu [2] regarding the excess return obtained by

continuously shorting variance swaps on every trading day of the sample period. We then analyzed

whether improved returns could be gained by selectively shorting variance swaps using large changes

in the VIX as a signal. In the insurance analogy, this strategy would be similar to an insurance

company carefully selecting when to sell insurance policies based on their expectations about the

excess returns to be had given a particular trigger criterion (e.g., selling hurricane insurance when

demand is high, but the intrinsic probability of a storm has not changed from its historical value).

The lack of correlation identiﬁed in Sec. II between changes in the VIX and changes in the 30-

day realized volatility suggests that this strategy would outperform simply continuously shorting

variance swaps. This appears to be the case although statistics are limited. Due to the large

premium (excess returns) already associated with variance swaps, we ﬁnd that the additional

advantage is relatively small.

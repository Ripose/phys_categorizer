Traditional analysis of international terrorism,
now an endemic feature of the modern era, has
not sought to explain the emergence of rare but
extremely severe events. Using the tools of
extremal statistics, we analyze terrorist attacks
worldwide between 1968 and 2004, as compiled
in the National Memorial Institute for the Pre-
vention of Terrorism (MIPT) database [1]. We
ﬁnd that international terrorism exhibits a “scale-
free” behavior [2] with an exponent close to two.
We conjecture that such power-law behavior is
an extension of the still unexplained scale invari-
ance between the frequency and intensity [3] of
wars [4, 5, 6, 7]. Finally, we brieﬂy consider the
reasons why such scaling may exist and its impli-
cations for counter-terrorism policy.

Although terrorism has a long historical relationship
with politics [8], only in the modern era have small
groups of motivated individuals had access to extremely
destructive weapons [9, 10], particularly chemical or ex-
plosive agents. This dramatic increase in destructive
power has allowed severe terrorist attacks such as the
March 20 1995 release of the Sarin nerve agent in a
Tokyo subway which injured or killed over 5000, the
August 7 1998 car bombing in Nairobi, Kenya which in-
jured or killed over 5200, or the more well known attack
on September 11 2001 in New York City which killed
2823 [1]. Over the course of modern history, such at-
tacks have been treated as outliers. We show here that
discounting these events as special cases ignores signiﬁ-
cant patterns in terrorism over the past 37 years.

To extract and understand these patterns, we use ex-
tremal statistics to characterize the relationship between
the severity and frequency of terrorist events. By sever-
ity, we simply mean the number of individuals injured or
killed by an attack. Although many organizations track
terrorism worldwide, few provide their data publicly or
in anything but an aggregate form. The MIPT database
appears to be unique in its comprehensive detail as it con-
tains, as of January 2005, records of over 19 907 terrorist
events in 187 countries worldwide between 1968 and 2004.
Of these, 7 088 resulted in at least one person being in-
jured or killed. It is itself the compilation of the RAND
Terrorism Chronology 1968-1997, the RAND-MIPT Ter-
rorism Incident database (1998-Present), the Terrorism
Indictment database (University of Arkansas & Univer-
sity of Oklahoma), and DFI International’s research on
terrorist organizations. Each record includes the date,
target, city (if applicable), country, type of weapon used,

terrorist group responsible (if known), number of deaths
(if known), number of injuries (if known), a brief descrip-
tion of the attack and the source of the information.

Tabulating the event data as a histogram of severity
(injuries, deaths and their aggregation greater than zero),
we show the cumulative distribution functions P (x > X)
on log-log axes in Figure 1. That the distributions are
highly right-skewed is immediately obvious, and is exem-
pliﬁed by the fact that the means of the distributions are
14.60 ± 114.82, 5.13 ± 43.37 and 12.70 ± 103.38 respec-
tively, while the largest corresponding events are 5000,
2823 and 5291. The regularity of the scaling illustrates
that the extremal events are not outliers, but are instead
in concordance with a global pattern in terrorist attacks.
Surprisingly, this scaling exists in spite of strong hetero-
geneity in the types of weapons, the perpetrating orga-
nizations, locations and political motivations.

FIG. 1: The distributions P (x > X) of the severity (injuries,
deaths and their aggregation) of terrorist attacks worldwide
between 1968 and 2004, from [1]. These distributions are well-
modeled by power laws with scaling parameters of α = 1.867±
0.002, α = 1.842 ± 0.002 and α = 1.878 ± 0.001 respectively.

Hypothesizing that these distributions are power laws
of the form P (x) ∼ x−α, we bootstrap the numeric max-
imization of the likelihood function 50 times to estimate
the scaling parameter α. We ﬁnd that all three dis-
tributions are well-modeled over several decades in the
tail by a power law with α ≈ 2. Further, the relevant
Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness-of-ﬁt test [11] indicates
that there is insuﬃcient evidence to reject this hypoth-

esis (pKS > 0.05). On the other hand, we may reject

have not considered mixtures of heavy-tailed distribu-
tions, which may result in a better ﬁt. In support of our
results here, an analysis of the International Policy Insti-
tute for Counter-Terrorism’s (ICT) event database [13],
with only 1417 events between May 1980 and Decem-
ber 2002, yields similar results. Table I summarizes the
power laws for the three distributions.

hypothesis seems ill-suited to explain the scaling in the
severity of terrorist attacks. However, we ﬁnd it plausi-
ble that Richardson’s scaling law and the one we docu-
ment here may both be related to the exponentially de-
creasing economic cost of inﬂicting death or injury [10].
When combined with other factors like a growing num-
ber of players interested in inﬂicting such damage and a
preference for attacking targets with dense populations,
these scaling laws may emerge naturally. Further study
is needed to substantiate this theory.

TABLE I: A summary of the power law distributions for the
severity of terrorist attacks between 1968 and 2004.

Of the 7 088 attacks which killed or injured at least one
person, 4 784 (67%) correspond to attacks since 1998,
when the MIPT assumed maintenance of the database.
This increase may be due,
in part, to more eﬃcient
recording. However, we ﬁnd only a 3% diﬀerence between
the scaling of the total severity distributions before and
after January 1 1998. This suggests that the scaling is
neither a recent phenomenon, nor the result of changes
in data collection.

We conjecture that this scale invariance in terrorism
worldwide is an extension of the power law observed by
Richardson in 1948 [4] for the frequency versus intensity
of wars. Using similar statistical tools on the data of
Small and Singer [14], Newman found a scaling parame-
ter of α = 1.80 ± 0.09, which is evocatively close to that
which we measure for global terrorism.

Although it has been suggested that Richardson’s scal-
ing law is the result of a metastability in a self-organized
critical (SOC) [15] system of geopolitics [16, 17], this

Because the most likely scaling parameter for the to-
tal severity distribution is in the range α < 2, the mean
and maximum values will be inﬁnite. Thus, if this scal-
ing governs the patterns of global terrorism in the future,
we will continue to see increasingly more severe attacks.
On the other hand, a severity-proportional reduction in
frequency of terrorist attacks at all scales would increase
the scaling parameter, thus making the mean, and ul-
timately the variance, ﬁnite.
Inhibiting the generative
mechanism, perhaps by reducing either the number of
players or increasing the cost of inﬂicting injury/death,
may also lead to similar scaling changes.

Finally, over the course of the 37 years of data, the
mean inter-event interval has been dropping steadily. In
1980, it was 96 hours, while since 1998, the average inter-
val has been only 17.3 hours. Historically, the probability
of seeing an event of at least the total severity of the at-
tacks on September 11 2001 is P (x > 2823) ≈ 3 × 10−4.
Thus, if this distribution continues to govern the sever-
ity of attacks in the future and the sampling rate remains
constant, we may expect that to see another catastrophic
attack of at least that severity within 7 years, or by 2012.

Abstract

This paper continues a series of studies of dependence patterns follow-
ing from properties of the bivariate probability distribution P(x, y) of two
consecutive price increments x (push) and y (response). The paper focuses
on individual diﬀerences of the P(x, y) for 2000 stocks using a methodology
of identiﬁcation of asymmetric market mill patterns developed in [1, 2]. We
show that individual asymmetry patterns (portraits) are remarkably stable
over time and can be classiﬁed into three major groups - correlation, anti-
correlation and market mill. We analyze the conditional dynamics resulting
from the properties of P(x, y) for all groups and demonstrate that it is trend-
following at small push magnitudes and contrarian at large ones.

1 Introduction

Development of a quantitative picture of the dynamics of ﬁnancial markets
essentially consists in unraveling dependence patterns characterizing the evo-
lution of prices. Inherent randomness present in price dynamics leads to a
necessity of using the probabilistic approach. The full probabilistic descrip-
tion of dependence patterns is then provided by the corresponding multivari-
ate probability distributions. In the simplest case considered in the present
paper and the previous papers of this series [1, 2] we analyze the dependence
patterns linking two consecutive price increments.

An idea of describing the stock price dynamics in terms of the bivari-
ate probability density P(x, y) characterizing the probabilistic interrelation
between two consecutive price increments, x (push) and y (response), was
ﬁrst explicitly suggested by Mandelbrodt [3], where interesting features of
bivariate Levy distribution were considered. An idea of characterizing indi-
vidual dynamical properties of a single stock by the two-dimensional portrait
of the equiprobability lines of this distribution was later put forward in [4].
The properties of the bivariate probability distribution P(x, y) were also dis-
cussed in relation to the so-called ”compass rose” pattern [5], in particular,
in connection with the issue of predictability [6, 7].

The present paper continues a series of papers [1, 2] devoted to an analysis
of dependence patterns following from particular properties of the bivariate
distribution P(x, y).
In the previous papers [1, 2] we studied an average
picture describing properties of an ensemble of pairs of consequent price
increments combining all stocks under consideration. Detailed studies of
high frequency data revealed a complex nonlinear probabilistic dependence
pattern linking consecutive price increments x and y. In the ﬁrst paper of
the series [1] we discussed various asymmetries characterizing the bivariate
distribution and showed that all of them are described by the same universal
market mill pattern. In the next paper [2] we performed a detailed analysis of
the geometry of the bivariate distribution characterizing the consecutive price
increments. We found, in particular, that shapes of the bivariate distribution
around the origin in the xy plane and far from it are noticeably diﬀerent. In
particular, the conditional response distribution P(y|x) at increasing push
magnitude was found to become progressively more gaussian.

In the present paper we analyze the dependence patterns characterizing

the bivariate distribution P(x, y) on the stock-by-stock basis.

The paper is organized as follows.

2

Section 2 is devoted to an identiﬁcation of the basic types of asymmetry
patterns of the bivariate distribution for individual stocks, analysis of the
frequency of their occurrence and of the characteristic features of conditional
dynamics corresponding to diﬀerent pattern types. In paragraph 2.1 we de-
scribe the dataset and the probabilistic methodology used in our analysis.
In paragraph 2.2.1 we analyze the basic features of the summary bivariate
probability distribution studied in the previous papers [1, 2]. In paragraph
2.2.2 we introduce several visually recognizable basic types of bivariate de-
pendence patterns characterizing individual stocks: correlation, anticorrela-
tion and market mill ones. In paragraph 2.2.3 a quantitative classiﬁcation
of individual bivariate patterns based on the probabilistic weight of various
sectors in xy plane computed on the annual basis is introduced. An analysis
of the ensembles of stocks traded at NYSE and NASDAQ shows important
diﬀerences in the relative proportions of various patterns. In paragraph 2.2.4
we show that diﬀerent patterns are in fact ”deformed” variants of the basic
market mill pattern and have common basic features of conditional dynam-
ics which is trend-following at small pushes and contrarian at large ones.
In paragraph 2.2.5 we analyze the relative yield of diﬀerent patterns on the
monthly basis. We show that for the overwhelming majority of stocks condi-
tional dynamics is characterized by two coexisting types of patterns that are
on average mixed at a ratio 3:1. In paragraph 2.2.6 we discuss the asymmetry
patterns characterizing non-tradable and tradable indices. We show that the
non-tradable indices are characterized by the correlation dependence pattern
while the tradable indices are characterized by the anticorrelation one.

In section 3 we turn to an analysis of the pattern stability on the monthly
time scale. We introduce a distance in the pattern space and show that the
average distance between the consecutive monthly patterns of the same stock
is less than that between the considered stock and all other stocks or all other
stocks in the same pattern group in the same month.

In section 4 we formulate the main conclusions of the paper.

2 Individual portraits

2.1 Data and methodology

Our analysis is based on the data on 1 -minute price increments of 2000
stocks traded at NYSE and NASDAQ stock exchanges in the year of 20042.
We consider two consequent time intervals of length ∆T , correspondingly
x = p(t1 + ∆T ) − p(t1) (push) and y = p(t1 + 2 ∆T ) − p(t1 + ∆T ) (response).
The full probabilistic description of price dynamics in the push-response xy
plane is given by a bivariate probability density P(x, y). Knowledge of the
bivariate distirbution P(x, y) fully speciﬁes, in particular, a description of the
corresponding conditional dynamics in terms of the conditional distribution
P(y| x) = P(x, y)/P(x).

In the previous papers [1, 2] we studied the properties of the summary
bivariate probability distribution Ptot(x, y) for the complete ensemble of pairs
of price increments combining contributions from all the stocks considered.
In the present paper we focus on analyzing the properties of the bivariate

probability distributions Pi(x, y), where i indexes some particular stock.

2.2

Individual portraits: identiﬁcation and statistics

As stated above, our goal is in studying the properties of bivariate probability
distributions Pi(x, y) that fully characterizes the probabilistic pattern linking
consecutive price increments x and y for the i-th stock. We shall refer to these
patterns as to ”individual portraits”.

2.2.1 Group portrait

Let us start with reminding of how the ”group portrait”, i.e. the bivariate
distribution Ptot(x, y) combining all pairs of consecutive price increments
considered, looks like [1, 2]. A two-dimensional projection of log8 Ptot(x, y)
for the particular case of consecutive 1 - minute price increments is shown
in Fig. 1. As shown in [1, 2], this distribution has a number of remarkable
properties illustrated by the sketch of the proﬁle of equiprobability levels in
Fig. 2, in which the push-response xy plane is divided into sectors numbered
counterclockwise from I to VIII.

2All holidays, weekends and oﬀ-market hours are excluded from the dataset.

A detailed description of symmetries of the bivariate probability distri-
bution Ptot(x, y) is achieved [1] by considering its symmetry properties with
respect to the axes y = 0, y = x, x = 0 and y = −x . In the present paper
we shall restrict our consideration to the asymmetry with respect to the axis
x = 03.

A convenient visualization of the symmetry pattern in question is pro-
vided by the following decomposition [1, 2] of Ptot(x, y) into symmetric and
3An analysis of the asymmetry pattern with respect to the axis y = x shows that the

arising individual portraits are either of the market mill type or noise.

A salient feature of the distribution shown in Fig. 1 and sketched in Fig. 2
is that all even sectors are stronger (contain more of probability density)
than all odd ones. This leads to the remarkable market mill structure of the
summary distribution P a(p)
tot (x, y) shown in Fig. 3 which leads, in particular, to

the z - shaped mean conditional response hyix described in [1]. Let mention
two important features characterizing the distribution plotted in Fig. 3. First,
the blades in the second and fourth quadrants corresponding to negative
autocorelation are more pronounced than their correlation counterparts in
the ﬁrst and third quadrants of the xy plane. A second interesting feature is
a a presence of a number of isolated small domains, in particular right below
the negative and right above the positive semi-axes x < 0 and x > 0. Their

7

existence can be explained by the speciﬁc asymmetry related to the rounding
of the summary increment x+y with $ 0.05 accuracy, so that, e.g. a sequence
of increments $ 0.08, $ -0.18 will be more frequent than $ 0.08, $ 0.18. Let us
note that had we worked with normalized increments, i.e. returns, we would
not be able to see this eﬀect.

2.2.2 Basic patterns

Is the pattern shown in Figs. 1,2,3 a dominant one for all the stocks or does it
result from a superposition of several distinctly diﬀerent types of portraits?
To answer this question we have to try to identify a robust basis in the
pattern space and analyze the frequencies with which these basic patterns
occur.
In what follows we shall concentrate on analyzing the asymmetry
of individual bivariate probability distributions Pi(x, y), i = 1, · · · , 2000, as
characterized by the positive part of its asymmetric component P a(p)
(x, y)
deﬁned analogously to the case of summary distribution, see Eqs. (1) - (3).
The market mill shape of the group distribution asymmetry shown in
Fig. 3 looks especially nontrivial if compared to standard asymmetry patterns
corresponding to correlated (anticorrelated) push x and response y, which
just correspond to symmetric patterns ﬁlling quadrants 1 and 3 and 2 and
4 respectively. It is tempting to interpret the appearance of the market mill
pattern as resulting from a blend of correlative and anticorrelative behaviors.
A useful starting point for the subsequent pattern type analysis can thus be
a separation of the pattern space into three groups corresponding to the
dominance of market mill, correlation and anticorrelation behavior in the
conditional dynamics of an individual stock.

Visual inspection of the geometric structure of the individual portraits
P a(p)
(x, y) indeed suggests that a vast majority of them can be classiﬁed as
i
belonging to these three main types. The sample patterns for the stocks DIS,
HDI and DE providing clear examples of anticorrelation (DIS), market mill
(HDI) and correlation (DE) behavior are shown in Fig. 4.

2.2.3 Basic patterns: quantitative classiﬁcation

Visual pattern recognition, albeit being very eﬀective, is not the most conve-
nient way of classifying a large number of images. It is therefore necessary to
devise some simple quantitative measure providing a suﬃciently robust sep-
aration of portraits into well-recognizable groups. To construct such quanti-

8

tative framework for distinguishing various pattern types let us return to the
full bivariate distributions Pi(x, y) and consider a rectangular domain in the
xy plane {|x| ≤ $ 0.3, |y| ≤ $ 0.3}. Our classiﬁcation will be based on the
relative weight of the eight sectors shown in Fig. 2. To calculate these weights
we ﬁrst remove all points lying exactly on the borders between the sectors
and denote the relative weights of the points lying inside the sectors I – VIII
by wI, · · · , wVIII correspondingly. A useful way of graphically presenting a
pattern characterized by a particular set of weights wI, · · · , wVIII is a spider’s
web diagram shown in Fig. 5 for the same three representative stocks DIS,
HDI and DE (see Fig. 4). In this diagram the weights are marked on the

correspond to distinctly diﬀerent spider web diagrams. The anticorrelation
pattern (DIS) is located along the north-west – south-east axis, the corre-
lation one (DE) is located along the north-east – south-west axis, while the
market mill one (HDE) can be described as a skewed rhomboid.

The group portrait pattern shown in Fig. 1 and sketched in Fig. 2 cor-
responds to a situation in which all even sectors are stronger than all odd
ones, so that on the set of sector weights wI, · · · , wVIII this generates a sys-
tem of 16 inequalities. We have already stressed that these are valid for a
summary probability distribution including all stocks, while at an individual
there exist several patterns characterized by some particular ordering of the
frequencies wI, · · · , wVIII. A detailed analysis shows that at an individual
level the above-mentioned 16 conditions weaken in such a way that

• out of 16 inequalities valid for the summary distribution (all even sec-

tors are stronger than all odd ones) there remains only four 4:

wII > wI wIV > wIII wVI > wV wVIII > wVII

(4)

• The distribution is centrally symmetric:

wI = wV wII = wVI wIII = wVII wIV = wVIII

(5)

Note that because of the central symmetry of the distribution it is suﬃcient to
consider a positive half-plane x > 0. All possible conﬁgurations are speciﬁed
by ordered permutations of the sequence (wI, wII, wIII, wIV) under conditions
wII > wI and wVIII > wVII. Therefore the conditions (4,5) allow for six
possible orderings of weights. To project this information on the desired
classiﬁcation into three types (correlation, anticorrelation and market mill)
we identify each pattern with a point in AC plane, where

A = (wII + wVI) − (wIII + wVII)
C = (wIV + wVIII) − (wI + wV)

(6)

It is easy to check that the three above-discussed patterns described in the
previous paragraph can be identiﬁed with the following location in the AC
plane:

4This is true for about 90% of all stocks. Note that visual inspection of Fig. 5 conﬁrms

the validity of inequalities (4) for all three stocks presented in the ﬁgure.

In Fig. 6 we show the positions of the three sample stocks DIS, HDI and DE

the type (ACOR, MILL or COR) being assigned to each conﬁguration by
identifying the two strongest sectors. From classiﬁcation of conﬁgurations
presented in Table 1 we conclude that provided the inequalities (4) and equal-
ities (5) take place, correlation and anticorrelation patterns appear in 1/6 of
cases each, while the dominant 2/3 correspond to the market mill pattern.

On the one-year horizon the total ensemble of 2000 stocks is characterized

by the following pattern decomposition for the year 2004:

It is interesting to note that, as follows from Table 3, at NYSE the relative
yields of diﬀerent patterns are in agreement with the combinatorial yields in
Table 1, while at NASDAQ these proportions are heavily distorted.

2.2.4 Subgroup portraits and conditional dynamics

The examples discussed in the paragraph 2.2.2 correspond to ”ideal” exam-
ples of market mill, correlation and anticorrelation behavior. Let us now
study the group portraits of market mill, anticorrelation and correlation
subensembles formed according to the above-described AC classiﬁcation.
These portraits are shown in Figs. 11-136. Let us also consider the shapes of
the conditional mean response characterizing each of the groups under con-
sideration. The result is shown in Fig. 7. We see that the conditional mean
response for the mill group has a clear z-shaped structure. The anticorrela-
tion group shows a monotonous dependence on the push. In this case the
”extra” blades seen in sectors II and VI in Fig. 11 are too weak to change the
mean behavior at small pushes. For the correlation group the dependence
of conditional mean response on the push is markedly nonlinear and can be
described as stretched z-shaped one.

The basic conclusion one draws from analyzing the asymmetry patterns
shown in Figs. 11-13 is that, at least within the framework of the AC - classi-
ﬁcation under consideration, pure correlation and anticorrelation patterns do
not exist. They can rather be naturally described as ”deformed” market mill
patterns, in which ”wrong” sectors are never really empty. For anticorrela-
tion group this means that a well - deﬁned contrarian conditional dynamics
at large pushes coexists with a pronounced trend-following component that
serves as an ampliﬁer of the push. For the stocks in correlation group the
conditional dynamics is trend - following in the domain around the zero push,

but at large pushes the behavior is again contrarian. All three patterns un-
der consideration are thus characterized by the speciﬁc mixture of correlative
amplifying dynamics for small pushes and anticorrelative at large ones.

2.2.5 Pattern content on the monthly basis

In the previous paragraph we have seen that for stocks classiﬁed as correlation
and especially anticorrelation ones the group portraits diﬀer from the ”ideal”
ones. A possible reason for this is a temporal instability of the patterns. Let
us thus consider an evolution of the type of a stock on a monthly basis. For
the considered two-year period this generates, for each stock, a sequence of
24 symbols (a mixture of MILL,ACOR,COR). The type of a stock can then
be related to the dominant (highest frequency) pattern. For of 2000 stocks
under consideration this procedure gives the following results7

2.2.6 Indices

Let us complete the analysis of this paragraph by considering the asymmetry
properties of the bivariate distribution P(x, y) for two indices and two corre-
sponding ETFs : (SPX, NDX) and (SPY, QQQ) respectively. SPX and NDX
are non-tradable, while SPY and QQQ are their tradable counterparts.8 The
corresponding asymmetry patterns are shown in Fig. 14. We ﬁnd that

• Non-tradable indices NDX and SPX are characterized by correlation

• Tradable indices QQQ and SPY are characterized by anticorrelation

3 Pattern stability

The eﬀectiveness of the classiﬁcation described in the previous section can
naturally be measured by the stability of the individual portraits. The visual
stability of the asymmetry patterns can be very spectacular, see Fig. 17 in
[1], in which we show the asymmetry patterns for three sample stocks in two
consequent semi-annual periods.

A development of a more quantitative description of pattern stability is

possible at diﬀerent levels of soﬁstication.

Crude quantitative characterization of the pattern stability can can be
done in terms of the stability of the representative point in the AC plane.
8The tradable indices are deﬁned in such a way that SPY=SPX/40 and QQQ=NDX/10

portraits in time can be done with the help of spider web diagrams. A
stability of the pattern means that the spider web diagram for the same stock
does not change much when computed for two nonintersecting time periods.
This is illustrated in Fig. 10, in which we show the stability of the spider’s
web patterns of DIS, HDI and DE (Fig. 10 (a) – (c)) as well as that of PBG,
MAT and ACF patterns (Fig. 10 (d) – (e)) chosen to illustrate that stability
of spider’s web pattern is a universal property not restricted to conservation
of ”canonical” anticorrelation, market mill or correlation patterns. Especially
pronounced is the stability of the highly asymmetric and skewed pattern for
PBG (Fig. 10 (d)).

To get a more quantitative estimate, let us introduce a distance in the
pattern space as parametrized by the vectors of normalized sector weights
w = c(w1, · · · , w8), d(w1, w2) = DistL1(w1, w2). Each stock i is charac-
terized by the set vectors wi
N , where N depends on the time scale
at which one considers the pattern stability. A temporal evolution of the
pattern is then described by N − 1 distances di
N N −1, where
di
1 2 ≡ d(wi
2), etc. A stability of the individual pattern can be estimated
ti = mean(di
by comparing the average distance hdi
N N −1) with
an average simultaneous distance between the chosen pattern and the pat-
terns of other stocks in the same group (mill, correlation or anticorrelation)
hdi k
totali, where in the
latter two cases the averaging is ﬁrst done over the simultaneously existing
patterns and then over time. The result can be compactly expressed through
two ratios

groupi and between the pattern and all other patterns hdi k

If one chooses the monthly time scale, one ﬁnds ρG = 1.64 ± 0.38 and ρT =
1.8±0.43. This conﬁrms that self-similarity of an individual pattern is indeed
a dominating feature of the data.

4 Conclusions

Let us formulate once again the main conclusions of the present paper.

• Visual inspection of bivariate dependence patterns allows to classify
them into three major groups: correlation, anticorrelation and market
mill.

18

• A suggested classiﬁcation in terms of relative weights of diﬀerent sectors
in the push-response plane is shown to provide a stable characteriza-
tion of the conditional dynamics of individual stocks. This stability
is conveniently visualized by considering the corresponding spider web
diagrams.

• A developed characterization of patterns in terms of a position in the
AC plane is shown to provide an adequate characterization of the type
of conditional dynamics.

• Analysis of summary patterns for all of the three groups reveals com-
mon basic features of conditional dynamics: trend-following response
at small push magnitudes and contrarian response at large push mag-
nitudes.

• Quantitative classiﬁcation of bivariate patterns reveals important dif-
ferences between stocks traded at NYSE and NASDAQ stock exchanges.

• The asymmetry pattern characterizing non-tradable indices is of corre-
lation type while that of tradable indices is of anticorrelation one.

• Speciﬁc pattern is shown to be a stable characteristics of the stock.

Many observations in the dynamics of pedestrian crowds, including various self-organization phe-
nomena, have been successfully described by simple many-particle models. For ethical reasons,
however, there is a serious lack of experimental data regarding crowd panic. Therefore, we have an-
alyzed video recordings of the crowd disaster in Mina/Makkah during the Hajj in 1426H on January
12, 2006. They reveal two subsequent, sudden transitions from laminar to stop-and-go and “turbu-
lent” ﬂows, which question many previous simulation models. While the transition from laminar to
stop-and-go ﬂows supports a recent model of bottleneck ﬂows [D. Helbing et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.
97, 168001 (2006)], the subsequent transition to turbulent ﬂow is not yet well understood.
It is
responsible for sudden eruptions of pressure release comparable to earthquakes, which cause sudden
displacements and the falling and trampling of people. The insights of this study into the reasons
for critical crowd conditions are important for the organization of safer mass events. In particularly,
they allow one to understand where and when crowd accidents tend to occur. They have also led
to organizational changes, which have ensured a safe Hajj in 1427H.

INTRODUCTION

30, 2006, and January 1, 2007.

The interest of physicists in pedestrian dynamics
dates back at least to the year 1995, when a many-
particle model was proposed to describe observed self-
organization phenomena such as the directional segrega-
tion (“lane formation”) in pedestrian counterstreams and
oscillations of the passing direction at bottlenecks [1]. It
took ﬁve more years until clogging eﬀects and intermit-
tent ﬂows in situations of crowd panic were discovered
[2]. Since the year 2000, there is an avalanche of pub-
lications on pedestrians. This includes papers on other
force models [3] and cellular automata models of pedes-
trian dynamics [4–6], addressing counterﬂows [4, 5, 8],
the self-organized dynamics at intersecting ﬂows [9], ca-
pacity drops by interaction eﬀects [10], and the insta-
bility of pedestrian ﬂows [11]. Recent studies focus on
the empirical or experimental study of pedestrian ﬂows
[6, 12–18] by means of video analysis [19, 20].

One of the most relevant and at the same time most
challenging problems are panic stampedes, which are
a serious concern during mass events [21–24]. Despite
huge numbers of security forces and crowd control mea-
sures, hundreds of lives are lost in crowd disasters each
year. In this paper, we present a high-performance video
analysis of unique recordings of the Muslim pilgrimage
in Mina/Makkah, Saudi Arabia. It suggests that high-
density ﬂows can turn “turbulent” and cause people to
fall (see Sec. ). The occuring eruptions of pressure release
bear analogies with earthquakes and are de facto uncon-
trollable. We will, however, identify variables that are
helpful for an advance warning of critical crowd condi-
tions. In our summary and outlook, we will indicate how
our insights facilitated the organization of a safe Hajj in
1427H, i.e. during the stoning rituals between December

DATA ANALYSIS AND FUNDAMENTAL
DIAGRAM

While panic has recently been studied in animal experi-
ments with mice [25] and ants [26], there is still an evident
lack of data on critical conditions in human crowds. In
homogeneous corridors and at very large openings, uni-
directional pedestrian ﬂows are mostly assumed to move
smoothly according to the ”ﬂuid-dynamic” ﬂow-density
relationship Q(ρ) = ρV (ρ), where Q represents the ﬂow,
ρ is the pedestrian density, and the average velocity V
is believed to go to zero at some maximum density as in
traﬃc jams [15, 27–31] (see Fig. 1a). This formula is often
used as basis for the dimensioning and design of pedes-
trian facilities, for safety and evacuation studies. Our
video analysis of the Muslim pilgrimage in Mina/Makkah
shows, however, that this description needs corrections
at extreme densities. In particular, it does not allow one
to understand the “turbulent” dynamics causing serious
trampling accidents in dense crowds trying to move for-
ward.

We have evaluated unique video recordings of a
27.7m×22.5m large area in front of the 44m wide en-
trance of the previous Jamarat Bridge, where upto 3 mil-
lion Muslims perform the stoning ritual within 24 hours.
On the 12th day of Hajj, about 2/3 of the pilgrims exe-
cuted lapidation even within 7 hours. With a new com-
puter algorithm developed by us, we have extracted the
positions ~ri(t) and speeds ~vi(t) of pedestrians i as a func-
tion of time. This algorithm is based on the successive
application of several digital transformation, contrast en-
hancement, motion prediction and pattern recognition

techniques [32, 33].
It has been calibrated with data
obtained by manual evaluation and tested in ﬁeld exper-
iments under well-known conditions, with an accuracy of
about 95%. For the time period from 11:45am to 12:30
on January 12, 2006, the resulting dataset contains more
than 30 million position-velocity pairs in the evaluated
central area of size 20m×14m. We have restricted our-
selves to the evaluation of this area in order to avoid any
boundary eﬀects of the measurement algorithm. The res-
olution of 25 pixels per meter and 8 frames per second
allows one to determine even small average speeds by cal-
culating the mean value of a large sample of individual
speed measurements.

The data extracted from the videos allowed us to de-
termine not only densities in larger areas, but also local
densities, speeds, and ﬂows. The local density at place
~r = (x, y) and time t was measured as

ρ(~r, t) =

f (~rj(t) − ~r) .

is a Gaussian distance-dependent weight function. R is
a measurement parameter. The greater R, the greater
the eﬀective measurement radius, which is greater than
R. It can be calculated that the weight of neighboring
pedestrians located within the area AR = πR2 of radius
In another paper [33], we have shown that
R is 63%.
the average of the local density values obtained with for-
mulas (1) and (2) agrees well with the actual average
density ̺. Moreover, the variance of the local density
measurements around the given, average density ̺, goes
down with larger values of R. In fact, for R → ∞, all lo-
cal density measurements result in the same value, which
corresponds exactly to the overall number NR of pedestri-
ans, divided by the area AR = πR2 they are distributed
in. The latter corresponds to the classical method of de-
termining the average (“global”) density ̺. However, it
can also be determined by averaging over local density

In the fundamental diagram, one displays the absolute
value of the ﬂow as a function of the density. For further
aspects regarding the above deﬁnitions see Ref. [34].

As the criticality in the crowd depends on the lo-
cal conditions, we are interested in local measurements
with a small value of R, while many other measurements
in the literature present averages over larger areas. In
the central recorded area studied by us, local densities
reached values greater than 10 persons per square meter,
if R = 1m was chosen (Fig. 1a). The local densities
vary considerably (see Fig. 1c). As a rule of thumb, the
maximum local densities are twice as high as the average
densities. When a local density of 6 persons per square
meter is exceeded, the local ﬂow decreases by a factor of 3
or more, so that the outﬂow drops signiﬁcantly below the
inﬂow (see Figs. 1b and 2b). This causes a higher and
higher compression in the crowd, until the local densities
become critical in the end. While this seems to explain
crushing accidents quite well [2, 22], it is startling that
the crowd accident on January 12, 2006 occured in a
ﬂat and practically open area without signiﬁcant coun-
terﬂows.

Our video analysis revealed that, even at extreme den-
sities, the average local speeds and ﬂows stayed ﬁnite,
i.e. there was no level of crowdedness under which peo-
ple completely stopped moving (Fig. 1a). This is in
marked contrast to vehicle traﬃc [34, 35], where drivers
keep some minimum safety distance and stop to avoid
collisions.
It also causes an unexpected, second ﬂow
maximum at 9 persons/m2, which implies the possibility
of alternating forward and backward moving shockwaves
[36, 37] with serious consequences for the resulting crowd
dynamics. Such shock waves cause safety hazards and
have actually been observed [14, 28, 38, 39]. However,
a quantitative characterization of their properties and a
satisfactory understanding of the underlying mechanisms
are lacking. Current models fail, as it is hardly conceiv-
able that a 44m wide opening would cause intermittent
outﬂows through arching eﬀects [2]. Moreover, the no-
tion of shockwaves is confusing, as it is mostly used for
discontinuities in the density that are caused by random
initial velocity or density variations, while we observe
emergent, self-generated waves (Fig. 2a).

the diﬀerent average projected body

consider [40]. Note, however, that the average local speed

ing from diﬀerent directions, which caused a bottleneck ef-
fect. The contour plot below the arrows represents the “pres-
sure” P (~r) = ρ(~r)Var~r(~V ), which we have deﬁned as the
average pedestrian density ρ(~r) times the velocity variance

it around the average velocity
U (~r) [51]. The dark red area represents the highest values of
the “pressure”, where the most violent dynamics occurred (see
the crowd video in the supplementary material [41]). This is
also the area where people stumbled and where the accident
began.

TRANSITION FROM LAMINAR TO
STOP-AND-GO AND “TURBULENT” FLOWS

When viewing our video recordings in a 10 times accel-
erated fast-forward mode, we made some unexpected dis-
coveries: As the average density increased, we observed
a sudden transition from laminar to temporarily inter-
rupted,
longitudinally unstable ﬂows around 11:53am
(see the supplement [41] and Fig. 2). The emergent,
upstream moving stop-and-go waves persisted for more
than 20 minutes and were not caused by the Hajj ritu-
als. Around 12:19 and even higher densities, we found a

sudden transition to irregular ﬂows (see the supplement
[41] and Fig. 3), indicating a second instability. These ir-
regular ﬂows were characterized by random, unintended
displacements into all possible directions, which pushed
people around. With a certain likelihood, this caused
them to stumble. As the people behind were moved by
the crowd as well and could not stop, fallen individu-
als were trampled, if they did not get back on their feet
quickly enough. Tragically, the area of trampled people
spread to larger and larger areas in the course of time,
as they became obstacles for others.

Let us study these observations in more detail. Due
to the small acceleration times of pedestrians,
the
delay-based mechanism suggested to describe stop-and-
go waves in vehicle traﬃc [34, 35] cannot be transfered
to pedestrian crowds. However, a recent theoretical ap-
proach suggests that intermittent ﬂows at bottlenecks
can also be generated by coordination problems in bot-
tleneck areas, causing an alternation between forward
pedestrian motion and backward gap propagation [37].
This theory predicts a transition from smooth ﬂows to
stop-and-go patterns when the inﬂow exceeds the out-
ﬂow.
In our videos of January 12, 2006, stop-and-go
waves started in fact at the time when the outﬂow from
the recorded area dropped below a value of 0.8 persons
per meter and second (Fig. 2b), which supports this the-
ory.

But how do we explain the second transition from stop-
and-go to irregular ﬂows (Fig. 3a, b), which occured at
12:19 (Fig. 3c)? A closer look at our videos reveals that,
at this time, people were so densely packed that they
were moved involuntarily by the crowd. This is reﬂected
by random displacements into all possible directions (see
the crowd video in the supplement [41]). To distinguish
these irregular ﬂows from laminar and stop-and-go ﬂows
and due to their visual appearance, we will refer to them
as “crowd turbulence”.

As in certain kinds of ﬂuid ﬂows, “turbulence” in
crowds results from a sequence of instabilities in the ﬂow
pattern. Additionally, we ﬁnd the sharply peaked prob-
ability density function of velocity increments

V τ
x = Vx(~r, t + τ ) − Vx(~r, t) ,

(8)

which is typical for turbulence [44], if the time shift τ
is small enough (Fig. 3d). We also observe a power-
law scaling of the displacements indicating self-similar
behaviour (Fig. 3e). As we do not observe large eddies,
the similarity with ﬂuid turbulence is limited, but there is
still an analogy to turbulence at currency exchange mar-
kets [44] (see Fig. 3d). Instead of vortex cascades in tur-
bulent ﬂuids, we rather ﬁnd a hierarchical fragmentation
dynamics: At extreme densities, individual motion is re-
placed by mass motion (Fig. 1a), but there is a stick-slip
instability which leads to “rupture” when the stress in
the crowd becomes too large. That is, the mass splits up
into clusters of diﬀerent sizes with strong velocity correla-
tions inside and distance-dependent correlations between
the clusters.

“Crowd turbulence” has further speciﬁc features. Due
to the physical contacts among people in extremely dense
crowds, we expect commonalities with granular media
beyond the level of analogy established in previous work
[43]. In fact, dense driven granular media may form den-
sity waves, while moving forward [45], and can display
turbulent-like states [46, 47]. Moreover, under quasi-
static conditions [46], force chains [48] are building up,
causing strong variations in the strengths and directions

dynamics (see the crowd video in the supplement [41]) starts

of local forces. As in earthquakes [49, 50] this can lead
to events of sudden, uncontrollable stress release with
power-law distributed displacements. Such a power-law
has also been discovered by our video-based crowd anal-
ysis (see Fig. 3d).

In contrast to purely density-based assessments, we
suggest to quantity the criticality of the situation in the
crowd by the “pressure”

P (~r, t) = ρ(~r, t)Var~r,t(~V ) ,

(9)

i.e. the local pedestrian density times the local velocity
variance Var~r,t(~V ). Closeup video recordings show that,
under “turbulent” conditions, the densities and resulting
mechanical pressures are so unbearable that people try to
escape the crowd and start pushing to gain space. This
state, which is sometimes called “crowd panic”, is char-
acterized by additional energy input in compressed ar-
eas, in contrast to normal ﬂuids or granular media. This
causes particularly violent displacements in extremely
dense crowds, which are practically impossible to control
even by large numbers of security forces and reﬂected
by a diﬀerent scaling behaviour of the so-called structure
function

S(∆~r) = hk~V (~r + ∆~r, t) − ~V (~r)k2i~r,t

(10)

compared to ﬂuids (Fig. 3f). Current simulation models
of crowd panics fail to reproduce this “turbulent” dynam-
ics, as they neglect that the propulsion force of people
increases in areas of extreme densities.

SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK

In summary, even in extremely dense crowds with local
densities upto 10 persons per square meter, the motion
of the crowd is not entirely stopped. This produces over-
critical densities. The largest danger, however, originates
from the dramatically diﬀerent crowd dynamics at high
densities. We have found two sudden transitions lead-
ing from laminar to stop-and-go ﬂows and from there to
“turbulent” crowd motion, which can trigger the tram-
pling of people, in contrast to previously discovered self-
organisation phenomena in pedestrian crowds [14]. Stop-
and-go waves start, when the density is high and the ﬂow
drops below a critical value (Fig. 2a, b), while “turbu-
lent” dynamics sets in with overcritical “pressures” in the
crowd [51], see Fig. 3c. The critical values depend on the
choice of R in the evaluation of the local densities, speeds,
and variances, see Eq. (2). It is still an unresolved chal-
lenge to simulate both transitions, from laminar to stop-
and-go and “turbulent” ﬂows by a many-particle model
just by increasing the inﬂow to a bottleneck area.

Practical Implications

5

Due to the generality of these mechanisms, we expect
that our ﬁndings are transferable to other mass gath-
erings. In fact, qualitatively similar conclusions can be
drawn from video recordings at the same location during
the Hajj in the year 2005. In that year, the pressure did
not reach so high values and no accident occurred, but
in 1997 and 1998 there were crowd disasters North of the
ramp of the Jamarat Bridge as well. Similar observations
were reported by Fruin [39] from other places: “At occu-
pancies of about 7 persons per square meter the crowd
becomes almost a ﬂuid mass. Shock waves can be prop-
agated through the mass, suﬃcient to ... propel them
... People may be liter-
distances of 3 meters or more.
ally lifted out of their shoes, and have clothing torn oﬀ.
Intense crowd pressures, exacerbated by anxiety, make it
diﬃcult to breathe, which may ﬁnally cause compressive
asphyxia. The heat and the thermal insulation of sur-
rounding bodies cause some to be weakened and faint.
Access to those who fall is impossible. Removal of those
in distress can only be accomplished by lifting them up
and passing them overhead to the exterior of the crowd.”
This drastic picture visualizes the conditions in extremely
dense crowds quite well, but Fruin and others have not
provided a scientiﬁc analysis and interpretation.

Turbulent waves are experienced in dozens of crowd-
intensive events each year all over the world [39]. There-
fore, it is necessary to understand why, where and when
potentially critical situations occur. Viewing real-time
video recordings is not very suited to identify critical
crowd conditions: While the average density rarely ex-
ceeds values of 6 persons per square meter, the local den-
sities can vary considerably due to dynamical patterns in
the crowd (see Fig. 1c). Moreover, evaluating the local
densities is not enough to identify the critical times and
locations precisely, which also applies to an analysis of
the velocity ﬁeld [41]. The decisive quantity is rather the
variance of speeds, multiplied by the density, i.e. what
we call the “pressure” [51]. It allows one to identify crit-
ical locations (Fig. 2c) and times (Fig. 3c). There are
even advance warning signs of critical crowd conditions:
The crowd accident on January 12, 2006 started about
10 minutes after “turbulent” crowd motion set in, i.e. af-
ter the “pressure” exceeded a value of 0.02/s2 (Fig. 3c).
Moreover, it occured more than 30 minutes after the av-
erage ﬂow dropped below a critical threshold (Fig. 2b),
which can be identiﬁed by watching out for stop-and-go
waves in accelerated surveillance videos (Fig. 2a). Such
advance warning signs of critical crowd conditions can be
evaluated on-line by an automated video analysis system.
In many cases, this can help one to gain time for correc-
tive measures such as ﬂow control, pressure relief strate-
gies, or the separation of crowds into blocks to stop the
propagation of shockwaves [41]. Such anticipative crowd

control could certainly increase the level of safety during
future mass events.

Implications for the Hajj in 1427H

Based on our insights in the reasons for the accidents
during the Hajj in 1426H, we have recommended many
improvements.
In the following, we mention only the
most important changes in the organization of the Hajj
in 1427H:

• The stoning capacity of the Jamarahs and, thereby,
the ﬂow capacity of the diﬀerent levels of the Jama-
rat Bridge was improved by an elongated, elliptical
shape.

• On the plaza around the Jamarat Bridge, no op-
portunity for accumulation of the crowd was given.

• An automated counting of pilgrims using the sig-
nals of the surveillance cameras was implemented
to have all the time a reliable overview over the
densities and capacity utilizations in critical places
of the system.

• Complementary, a new plaza design allowed the
General Security to easily balance the ﬂows be-
tween the ground ﬂoor of the current construction
stage of the new Jamarat Bridge and the Northern
and Southern ramps of the ﬁrst ﬂoor, in order to
avoid overloading and a breakdown of the ﬂow.

• The two-way operation of the street system and
the Jamarat plaza was replaced by a one-way oper-
ation in order to avoid obstructions and problems
by counterﬂows.

• A systematically optimized scheduling and routing
program was applied in order to reach a homoge-
neous distribution of registered pilgrims in space
and time.

These and some further changes (which will be described
in detail in some other publications) ultimately reached
comfortable and continuous ﬂows conditions and a safe
Hajj in 1427H, although the situation was expected to
be particularly critical due to a lack of experience with
the implemented changes and due to the signiﬁcantly in-
creased number of pilgrims in 1427H. As the new Jamarat
Bridge will be expanded in 2007 by additional ﬂoors, it
will have a greater capacity in 1428H and imply the need
for changes in the organizational concepts to avoid bot-
tlenecks in other places. This will pose new challenges for
crowd researchers, experts, and authorities in the future.

[51] This “gas-kinetic” deﬁnition of the pressure is to be dis-
tinguished from the mechanical pressure experienced in
a crowd. However, a monotonously increasing functional
relationship between both kinds of pressure is likely, at
least when averaging over force ﬂuctuations.

We have examined a topology of 21 public transport networks in Poland.
Our data exhibit several universal features in considered systems when they
are analyzed from the point of view of evolving networks. Depending on
the assumed deﬁnition of a network topology the degree distribution can
follow a power law p(k) ∼ k−γ or can be described by an exponential func-
tion p(k) ∼ exp(−αk). In the ﬁrst case one observes that mean distances
between two nodes are a linear function of logarithms of their degrees prod-
uct.

1. Introduction

Have you ever been confused and tired using city public transport? Have
you studied city maps during your holiday’s excursions looking for the best
connection from a railway station to your hotel? Do you think there is any
regularity in complex objects called public transport systems? During the
last few years several transport networks have already been investigated us-
ing various concepts of statistical physics of complex networks. A study of
Boston underground transportation system (MBTA) [1, 2] has taken into
account physical distances and has been focused on problems of links eﬃ-
ciency and costs. In [3] a part of the Indian Railway Network (IRN) has
been considered and a new topology describing the system as a set of train
lines, not stops has been introduced. In [4] data from MBTA and U-Bahn
network of Vienna have been compared to predictions of random bipartite

graphs. Another class of transport systems form airport and airlines net-
works: world-wide [5, 6], Chinese [7] or Indian [8] airline networks - here
such properties as links weights, correlations among diﬀerent airports and
their centrality have been investigated.

In the present paper we have studied a part of data for public transport
networks in 21 Polish cities and we ﬁnd that among apparent diﬀerences
there are also universal features of these systems. As far as we know, our
results are the ﬁrst comparative survey of several individual transport sys-
tems in the same country.

2. Network topology: space L and space P

It is clear that distances for city travelers are not the same as physical
distances if he/she needs to come from a city point A to a city point B
using existing public transport media. Sometimes it occurs that a physical
distance between points A and B is not very large but the travel between
these points in the city is unfortunately time consuming since either a direct
bus makes a lot of loops on its way or we need to change buses or tramways
several times. It follows that one can introduce at least two diﬀerent rep-
resentations of city transport networks where a network is a set of nodes
(vertices) and links (edges) between them. The ﬁrst representation is the

space L which consists of nodes being bus or tramway stops while a link

between two nodes exists provided they are consecutive stops on a bus or a
tramway line. The distance in such a space is measured by the total num-
ber of stops passed on the shortest path between two nodes. However the
distance measured in such a way does not reﬂect the necessity of transfer
during the trip. This factor is taken into account in the second space P [3].
Nodes in such a space are the same as in the previous one but now an edge
connecting two nodes means that there is a link by a single bus or tramway
between them.
It follows that in the space P the distances are numbers
of transfers (plus one) needed during the trip. It is obvious that distances
deﬁned in the space P are much shorter than in the space L and there is no
universal relation between them. Both spaces are presented at Fig. 1.

3. Explored systems

Fig. 2. Map of twenty one examined cities in Poland.

We have studied data collected from 21 public transport networks in
Polish cities that are depicted at Fig. 2 and listed in the Table 1. The
ﬁrst analyzed features are degree distributions for networks represented in
both spaces. A degree of node i is the number ki of its nearest neighbors.

and a large interest on such systems started from a discovery of scale-free
distributions in several real networks [10, 11, 12, 13].

The Fig. 3 shows typical plots for degree distribution in the space L. In
all studied plots we neglected the point k = 1 that corresponds to line ends.
Remaining parts of degree distributions can be approximately described by
a power law

with a characteristic exponent γ between 2.4 and 4.1. Values of ex-
ponents γ are diﬀerent from the value γ = 3 which is characteristic for
Barab´asi-Albert model of evolving networks with preferential attachment
and one can suppose that a corresponding model for transport network
evolution should include several other eﬀects. One can see also that larger
exponents γ correspond usually to larger numbers N of nodes in the network
(Table 1).

of urban transport networks.

Table 1 presents exponents γ and α for investigated cities. The values

have been received from the standard linear regression method.

3.1. Path length as function of product kikj

In [15] an analytical model of average path length was considered and it
was shown that the shortest path length between nodes i and j possessing
degrees ki and kj in a random graph characterized by its degree distribution
p(k) can be described as:

lij(ki, kj) =

− ln kikj + ln (cid:0)hk2i − hki(cid:1) + ln N − γ

where γ = 0.5772 is Euler constant while hki and hk2i are corresponding
ﬁrst and second moments of p(k) distributions. In [16, 17, 18] a random
tree (a random graph with no loops) was studied and it was shown that

We have found that if distances are measured in the space L then the
scaling (4) is well fulﬁlled for considered public transport networks (Fig.

0.96 and the best ﬁt to the scaling relation (4) has been found for Zielona
G´ora, where R2 = 0.996. Observed values of A and B coeﬃcients diﬀer as
much as 20 percent (in average) from theoretical values received for random
graphs where contribution from clustering and node degree correlations are
taken into account (see [16, 17, 19]).

It is useless to examine the relation (4) in the space P because of the
structure of this space.
In fact the set lij contains usually only 3 points
what means that one needs just two changes of a bus or a tram to come
from one city point to another [19].

4. Conclusions

In conclusion we have observed that public transport networks in many
Polish cities follow universal scalings. The degree distribution p(k) ﬁts to a
power law in the space L where a distance is measured in numbers of bus or
tram stops. A corresponding distribution in the space P where a distance
is measured in a number of transfers between diﬀerent vehicles follows an
exponential distribution. Distances in the space L are a linear function of

8

logarithms of corresponding nodes degrees.

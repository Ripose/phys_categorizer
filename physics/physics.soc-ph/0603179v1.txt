Abstract

To investigate an eﬀect of social interaction on the bystanders’ intervention in emergency situ-

ations a rescue model was introduced which includes the eﬀects of the victim’s acquaintance with

bystanders and those among bystanders from a network perspective. This model reproduces the

experimental result that the helping rate (success rate in our model) tends to decrease although

the number of bystanders k increases. And the interaction among homogeneous bystanders results

in the emergence of hubs in a helping network. For more realistic consideration it is assumed

that the agents are located on an one-dimensional lattice (ring), then the randomness p ∈ [0, 1]

is introduced: the kp bystanders are randomly chosen from a whole population and the k − kp

bystanders are chosen in the nearest order to the victim. We ﬁnd that there appears another peak

of the network density at about k = 9 and p = 0.3 also due to the bystanders’ interaction.

INTRODUCTION

The concepts and methods of statistical physics and nonlinear dynamics are applied

to investigate the social, economic and psychological phenomena [1, 2, 3]. Among the

interesting subjects that have attracted physicists are the opinion dynamics [4, 5] including

voting process [6, 7] and social impact theory [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. Social impact theory

stemmed from the bystander eﬀect by which people are less likely to intervene in emergencies

when others are present than when they are alone as a result of the inhibitory interaction

among bystanders [14, 15].

From the laboratory experiments about the emergency situations we can gain an insight

into this eﬀect. When tested alone, subjects behaved reasonably and the response rate was

high. However the rate was signiﬁcantly depressed when they were with other subjects.

Subjects with others were unsure of what had happened or thought other people would or

could do something. In another experiment subjects who were friends responded faster than

those who were strangers. The subjects who had met the victim were signiﬁcantly faster

to report victim’s distress than other subjects. And the degree of arousal that bystanders

perceive is assumed to be a monotonic positive function of the perceived severity and clarity

of the emergency, and bystanders’ emotional involvement with the victim [16], which is also

to be considered in an abstract way in Section II.

In order to investigate the social phenomena as complex systems more precisely we adopt

the network point of view by which it means that a social system consists of the interacting

agents, where each node and link of the network represent an agent and a relation or inter-

action between a pair of agents respectively [17, 18, 19, 20]. A number of properties about

the real world networks such as social, technological and biological ones, have been revealed

and investigated. Two of the main features of the real world networks are the small world

eﬀect and the high clustering to be considered in this paper by introducing a randomness

p, the fraction of the randomly chosen bystanders to the k bystanders per accident, which

plays a similar role to that of Watts-Strogatz model [21]. The original dimensionless model

for the bystander eﬀect is extended to the more realistic and general one in Section III.

II. RESCUE MODEL

Recently in order to investigate an eﬀect of social interaction on the bystanders’ interven-

tion in emergency situations a rescue model (RM) was introduced [22]. The model includes

the eﬀects of the victim’s acquaintance with bystanders and those among bystanders. The

RM focuses on the relations between agents rather than on agents themselves, so deﬁned is

a relation spin between two agents as aij whose value is 1 if agent i (agent j) has succeeded

in rescuing agent j (agent i), and 0 otherwise. aij is symmetric and can be interpreted as an

element of adjacency matrix of helping network. Each agent i has its intervention threshold

ci over which that agent can try to intervene in an emergency situation.

At each time step an accident happens which consists of the degree of the clarity or sever-

ity of accident represented as a random number qv uniformly drawn from [0, 1], a randomly

chosen victim v and k bystanders which are also randomly chosen from a population. Nv

denotes the set of k bystanders. For each bystander i the degree of willingness to intervene

xvi is calculated:

xvi(t) = qv + αavi(t) + β

(2aij(t) − 1) − ci.

(1)

Xj∈Nv,j6=i

Only one bystander i ∈ Nv with the largest value xvi can intervene per accident, which can

be called the intervener selection rule. If we assume that the response speed of bystander

i is exponential in xvi, the selection of the bystander with the largest xvi is justiﬁed. Ad-

ditionally, once one bystander intervenes, the pressures on the others will disappear. Then

the adjacency matrix is updated as following:

avi(t + 1) = θ (xvi(t))

(2)

where θ(x) is a heaviside step function. If xvi ≥ 0, the rescue succeeds and then for the

bystander i who intervened, the avi gets the new value of one.

In case of xvi < 0 the

rescue fails and then the avi gets the new value of zero. α represents the degree of victim’s

acquaintance with bystander, so can be called an acquaintance strength. The third term of

xvi is related to the interaction among bystanders. 2aij − 1 gives 1 if one bystander has

succeeded in rescuing the other or −1 otherwise. There does not exist any neutral relation

here. β is used to tune the strength of coupling so can be called a coupling strength. Among

them the main control parameter is the number of bystanders k. As observables we adopt

3

the network density [17] (helping rate in Ref. [22]) and the success rate respectively:

ak(t) =

2

N(N − 1) Xi<j

aij(t),

sk =

θ(xvi(t)).

T −1

1
T

Xt=0
In other words the success rate is deﬁned as the number of successful interventions divided

by the total number of interventions. Although the network density can be regarded as a

kind of helping rate, the success rate is closer to the helping rate deﬁned in the experiments

[15] in a sense that the intervention may either succeed or fail without changing the network

density. We ﬁx ci ≡ c = 0.25 for all i according to the experimental result [14] that 70 ∼ 75%

of isolated subjects intervened and c does not change through this paper, which means we

consider a population composed of homogeneous non-adaptive agents. Finally, the initial

conditions are aij = 0 for all pairs.

At ﬁrst let us consider the case without the coupling eﬀect among bystanders, i.e. β = 0.

Generally, an equation for the network density can be written as [22]

dak(t)
dt

= W0→1 − W1→0,

W0→1 = (1 − c)(1 − ak(t))k,

where

for ak yields

1 − (1 − ak(t))k
(cid:0)
W0→1 denotes the probability of creating a new link between the victim and the bystander

W1→0 = (c − α)

(cid:1)

.

and W1→0 does that of eliminating the existing link between them. The stationarity condition

ak = 1 −

c − α
1 − α (cid:19)

(cid:18)

1/k

,

which says ak is a monotonically decreasing function of k. In the numerical simulations ak(t)

ﬂuctuates around ak since the links are added or removed with ﬁnite probabilities 1 − c and

c − α respectively. As k increases, so does the probability that two connected agents, one

as a victim and the other as a bystander, get involved in an accident again. According to

the intervener selection rule one of the bystanders connected with the victim must intervene

4

(3)

(4)

(5)

(6)

and thus there is no reason for the increase in ak according to k. Consequently the helping

network gets sparse with the number of bystanders.

An equivalent of the success rate deﬁned in Eq. (4) is given by

sk = W0→1 + W1→1

= W0→1 − W1→0 + 1 − (1 − ak)k =

(7)

1 − c
1 − α

,

where we used the stationary solution for ak in Eq. (6). sk turns out to be independent of

k and of the network density too. In fact, for the sparser network each link should bear the

more burden on the intervention to ensure the success rate constant of k. From a viewpoint

of the uncertainty of a victim’s receiving help from the bystanders ak corresponds to the

cost that the victim should pay to minimize the uncertainty.

If the coupling eﬀect among bystanders is taken into account, then from the deﬁnition

of xvi the condition for the successful intervention can be obtained by a mean-ﬁeld approx-

imation, i.e. the substitution of ak for each aij:

or

xvi = qv + αak + β(k − 1)(2ak − 1) − c ≥ 0,

qv ≥ −(α + 2β(k − 1))ak + β(k − 1) + c ≡ q∗
v.

(8)

(9)

At any time step, when given ak the success rate corresponds to 1 − q∗
there appear two transition points k1 = c−α

v. In case with β > 0
β + 1 (see Fig. 1). At k = k1
for any accident the rescue succeeds, sk = 1, if and only if ak = 1 while at k = k2 for any

β + 1 and k2 = 1−c

accident the rescue fails, sk = 0, if and only if ak = 0. In the range of k1 ≤ k < k2, it
is evident that sk ≈ 1, q∗

α+2β(k−1) . Once c is larger than α/2, then
the helping network is so dense that the probability that the bystander who has not been

v ≈ 0 for ak ≥ 1

2 + c−α/2

connected with the victim intervenes is extremely low, so is the possibility of creating a new

link. One can expect that ak(t) increases since sk ≈ 1, but very slowly since the network is

suﬃciently dense.

Given W1→0 = 0 we can calculate the time evolution of ak(t) by considering only the

W0→1. In case that the victim is not connected with any of bystanders, if we assume that

at least one bystander is connected with all other bystanders, then for k1 ≤ k < k2,

dak(t)
dt

= W0→1 = (1 − c − β(k − 1))(1 − ak(t))k

= β(k2 − k)(1 − ak(t))k.

(10)

5

Taking ak(t = 0) = 0 as an initial condition yields

ak(t) = 1 − [β(k2 − k)(k − 1)t + 1]−1/(k−1) .

(11)

This solution represents the monotonically increasing behavior of the network density with

time step and the k dependence as well.

The time series of ak(t) shown in Fig. 2 verify the above arguments except that the

transition occurs at k = 18 larger than k1 expected by the mean-ﬁeld approximation because

of the ﬁnite size eﬀect. One can see from the Fig. 3 that as the system size increases, the

transition point approaches k1 = 16. Additionally ak(t) exhibits the punctuated equilibrium-

type behaviors at k slightly smaller than the transition point, which will be revised in relation

to the network viewpoint.

Figure 3 shows the numerical results for sk and ak, both of which decrease until k reaches

9 to 12. This tendency can be interpreted as the bystander eﬀect in that the bystanders are

less likely to intervene (succeed in rescuing the victim in our model) in emergencies when

others are present than then they are alone. Contrary to the case with β = 0 the decreasing

ak has an additional negative eﬀect on the coupling among bystanders due to the positive β,

thus lowers the degrees of willingness xvi in Eq. (8) and consequently sk. However, sk and ak

are getting large as k approaches k1 because of the excitatory coupling among bystanders.

Next, let us focus on the eﬀects of the acquaintance strength α and the coupling strength

β on the structure of helping networks.

If α = β = 0, since the degrees of willingness

xvi = qv − c for all bystanders are the same, the helping network shows a completely random

structure.

If we consider the acquaintance eﬀect, i.e. α > 0, the probability that two

connected agents get involved in an accident again increases. Therefore α has a ‘ﬁxation’

eﬀect on the helping network. If the coupling among bystanders is taken into account, i.e.

β > 0, the probability that the bystander connected with more other bystanders is more

likely to intervene in an emergency, thus β has an eﬀect of ‘preferential attachment (PA)’ on

the helping network. As a result of the PA the heterogeneous hubs and hierarchical structures

emerge from the homogeneous non-adaptive population as shown in Refs.

[18, 19, 20]. In

addition the above punctuated equilibrium-type behaviors of ak(t) in Fig. 2 accompany the

rises and falls of hubs whenever it undergoes the slow saturation and the following abrupt

decline. This phenomenon is very diﬀerent from those of other cases in which once one agent

becomes a hub, it lasts forever.

III. RESCUE MODEL IN A SMALL WORLD

In the previous section we ignored the spatial property of the system which does matter

in realities. For more realistic consideration the randomness p ∈ [0, 1] is introduced: when

assumed that the agents are located on an one-dimensional periodic lattice (ring), the kr ≡

kp among k bystanders are randomly chosen from a whole population, which can be called

the random bystanders, and the kn ≡ k −kr bystanders are chosen in the order in which they

are nearest to the victim in the Euclidean space, which can be called the near bystanders.

The near bystanders are to the local neighborhoods what the random ones are to the travelers

from other places and so on. The randomness p makes the long-range interaction possible

and plays the similar role in our model to the randomness deﬁned as a control parameter of

Watts-Strogatz small world networks [21].

A. Agents in the One-dimensional World

Let us ﬁrst consider the case with p = 0 which means that all the bystanders are the near

ones. In case of even k, one half of bystanders are left to the victim and the other half are

right to the victim. In case of odd k, k − 1 bystanders are chosen as for the case of even k

except that the side of the last (farthest) bystander is chosen randomly, that is, left or right

to the victim. We deﬁne a new observable yk as following:

where ⌈x⌉ is a ceiling function and the denominator is the maximum number of links limited

by the locality of interaction. By the deﬁnition of ak,

yk(t) =

1

aij(t)

⌈k/2⌉N Xi<j

ak,p=0 =

2

N(N − 1) Xi<j

aij =

2⌈k/2⌉
N − 1

yk.

(12)

(13)

In case with β = 0, since equations (5)-(7) are valid for yk, it is natural to regard yk as

ak,p=1. Thus the order of the network density is O(1/N) for small values of k so that the

network becomes much sparser than the case without locality. Interestingly sk,p=0 turns out
to be independent of k again, precisely sk,p=0 = sk,p=1 = 1−c

1−α . Similar to the reason for the
k independence of sk, in one-dimensional rescue model the probability that two connected

agents get involved in an accident again is very high, thus the helping network gets sparse and

7

as a result each link bears the more burden on the intervention. Conversely, the randomness

of choosing bystanders enhances the uncertainty of the victims in emergencies therefore it

makes the agents to be connected with more others to ensure the success rate.

In case with β > 0 the helping networks in the one-dimensional world consist of a few

hubs induced by the PA eﬀect and their peripheries. The number of hubs amounts to about

N/k and the number of peripheries per hub does to about k as shown in Fig. 4. Once the

degrees of any agents become larger than those of others by chance, they eventually grow to

the hubs and intervene in emergencies involved with their own peripheries and vice versa,

which forms some kind of helping communities.

In addition the helping network in Fig.

4 (b) bears some resemblance to the structured scale-free networks presented in order to

explain the high clustering in the real-world networks [23, 24] although the helping network

in this paper does not show the clustering eﬀect.

B. Agents in the Small world

The network densities and the success rates are scanned for the entire ranges of the

number of bystanders k and the randomness p. When β = 0 the numerical results depicted

in Fig. 5 (a) and (b) show the trivial behaviors. For each k, according to p the network

density ak,p leaps from ak,p=0 to about ak,p=1 as soon as at least one random bystander

appears, where kpc = 1 or pc = 1/k. For the smaller value of p the probability that two

connected agents get involved in an emergency again becomes larger so that the possibility

of creating new links decreases. On the other hand the eﬀect by the near bystanders is

ignorable. The uncertainty of receiving help is maximized at k = 1 and p = 1, where there

is only one bystander chosen completely randomly per accident. Therefore the network

density should be maximized to ensure the success rate. As seen in Fig. 5 (b), sk,p is

independent of k as well as of p since the coupling eﬀect among bystanders is not taken into

account.

If the coupling eﬀect among bystanders is considered then an interesting phenomenon is

observed in Fig. 5 (c) and (d), that is, there appears another peak of ak,p and sk,p at k = 9,

p ≈ 0.3. To understand this phenomenon, since the k bystanders per accident are divided

into two groups, we calculate the degree of willingness of the random bystanders xvr and

8

that of the near bystanders xvn respectively:

xvr = qv + αak,p + β(k − 1)(2ak,p − 1) − c,

xvn = qv + αak,p=0 + β(kn − 1)(2ak,p=0 − 1) + βkr(2ak,p − 1) − c,

where we have assumed that each random bystander does not distinguish the random ones

from the near ones, i.e. the probability that any other bystander is connected with that

bystander is the same as ak,p. On the other hand each near bystander is aﬀected by the

kn − 1 near ones, where the probability to be connected with the near one is ak,p=0, and the

kr random ones. What is important is about which kind of bystanders are more likely to

intervene and it roughly depends on the diﬀerence ∆x of the degrees of willingness,

∆x = xvr − xvn = (α + 2β(kn − 1))(ak,p − ak,p=0).

(14)

Since the diﬀerence is deﬁnitely nonnegative, the random bystanders are more likely to

intervene in emergencies than the near ones, which naturally leads to the increase in ak,p

according to p. However, the diﬀerence also depends on the kn which is a monotonically

decreasing function of p. As p increases the ∆x begins to increase but then diminishes

therefore so does the probability that the random bystanders are connected with the victim,

consequently the peak of ak,p appears. This happens only for the intermediate range of k

since for small values of k the coupling eﬀect due to a positive β is ineﬀective yet and for

large values of k, especially larger than k1, the success rate is very high thus the diﬀerence

∆x becomes meaningless.

In summary, the high randomness p does not ensure the high

level of the network density because of the inhibiting eﬀect by the near bystanders.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have studied not only the original rescue model, which was introduced

in order to investigate an eﬀect of social interaction on the bystanders’ intervention in

emergency situations, but also the rescue model on a small world. The bystander eﬀect has

been successfully reproduced and explained by the mean-ﬁeld approximation.

In general

both of the decreasing p and the increasing k reduce the network density since the victim

has more chance to get involved in the acquainted bystander. However, it is found that

there appears another peak of ak,p at about k = 9 and p = 0.3 for some given parameters,

9

which means that the increase in p does not ensure the increase in ak,p due to the inhibiting

eﬀect by the near bystanders.

The relation spins aij compose the helping networks. The coupling eﬀect represented

by β induces the emergence of hubs from a homogeneous non-adaptive population. In the

original RM the rises and falls of hubs have been observed and in one-dimensional world

the whole population is divided into a few helping communities, each of which consists of a

hub and its peripheries. Although we could not ﬁnd any real world helping networks, these

results give us an insight into the dynamics of helping behavior and networks.

0 ≤ p ≤ 1. (a) and (b) are for the case with β = 0 and (c) and (d) are for the case with β = 0.01

respectively. It is found that there appears another peak of ak,p at k = 9, p ≈ 0.3. Here N = 100,

α = 0.1 and c = 0.25 are used.

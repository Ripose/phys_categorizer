Abstract: The similarities between phase separation in physics and resi-
dential segregation by preference in the Schelling model of 1971 are reviewed.
Also, new computer simulations of asymmetric interactions diﬀerent from the
usual Ising model are presented, showing spontaneous magnetisation (= self-
organising segregation) and in one case a sharp phase transition.

1 Introduction

More than two millennia ago, the Greek philosopher Empedokles (according
to J. Mimkes) observed than humans are like liquids: Some mix easily like
wine and water, and some do not, like oil and water. Indeed, many binary
ﬂuid mixtures have the property that for temperatures T below some critical
temperature Tc, they spontaneously separate into one phase rich in one of the
two components and another phase rich in the other component. For T > Tc,
on the other hand, both components mix whatever the mixing ratio of the
two components is. Chemicals like isobutyric acid and water, or cyclohexane
and aniline, are examples with Tc near room temperature, though they smell
badly or are poisonous, respectively. For humans, segregation along racial,
ethnic, or religious lines, is well known in many places of the world.

Schelling [1] transformed the Empedokles idea into a quantitative model
and studied it. People inhabit a square lattice, where every site has four
neighbours to the North, West, South and East. Everyone belongs to one of
two groups A and B and prefers to be have neighbours of the same group
more than to be surrounded by neighbours of the other group. Thus with
some probability depending on the numbers nA and nB of neighbours of the
two groups, each person moves into a neighbouring empty site. After some
time with suitable parameters, large domains are formed which are either
populated mostly by group A or mostly by group B.

1

Physicists use the Ising model of 1925 to look at similar eﬀects. Again
each site of a large lattice can be A or B or empty; A and B are often called
“spin up” and “spin down” in the physics literature referring to quantum-
mechanical magnetic moments. The probability to move depends exponen-
nB)/T calculated from the neighbour states. A B
tially on the ratio (nA −
“prefers” to be surrounded by other B, and an A by other A. The lower this
temperature or tolerance T is the higher is the probability for A to move to
A-rich neighbourhoods, and for B to move to B-rich neighbourhoods. There-
fore at low T an initially random distribution of equally many A and B sites
will separate into large regions (“domains”) rich in A, others rich in B, plus
empty regions. In magnetism these domains are called after Weiss since a
century and correspond to the ghettos formed in the Schelling model.

This eﬀect can be seen easier without any empty sites. Then either a site
A exchanges places with a site B, or a site A is replaced by a site B and vice
versa, where in the above probabilities now nA and nB are the number of A
and B sites in the two involved neighbourhoods. Or, even simpler, a site A
changes into a site B or vice versa, involving only one neighbourhood. The
latter case can be interpreted as an A person moving into another city, and
another person of type B moving into the emptied residence. The physics
literature denotes the exchange mechanism as Kawasaki kinetics, the switch-
ing mechanism as Glauber (or Metropolis, or Heat Bath) kinetics. Again, at
low enough T large A domains are formed, coexisting with large B domains.
In the simpler switching algorithm, ﬁnally one of these domains wins over
the other, and the whole square lattice is occupied by mostly one type, A or
B.

The above T can instead of temperature be interpreted socially as tol-
erance: For high T no such segregation takes place and both groups mix
completely whatever the overall composition is. Instead of “tolerance” we
may interpret T also as “trouble”: External eﬀects, approximated as random
disturbances, may prevent people to live in the preferred residences, due to
war, high prices, low incomes, pecularities of the location, .... Some of these
eﬀects were simulated by Fossett [2]. Without these empty sites, we may
also interpret A as one type of liquid and B as the other type, and then
have a model for the above-mentioned binary liquids which may or may not
mix with each other via the Kawasaki exchange of places. Alternatively, we
may interpret A as a high-density liquid and B as a low-density vapour and
then have a model for liquid-vapour phase transitions: Only below some very
cold temperature can air be liqueﬁed. The ﬁrst approximate theory for these

2

liquid-vapour equilibria is the van der Waals equation of 1872.

Thus Schelling could have based his work on a long history of physics
research, or a ﬁlm of computer simulation published in Japan around 1968.
But in 1971 Schelling did now yet know this physics history [3] and his
model was therefore more complicated than needed and was at that time to
our knowledge not yet simulated in the Ising model literature. Schelling did
not consider T > 0 and at T = 0 his model has problems (see below) with
creating the predicted segregation. Even today, sociologists [4, 2, 5, 6] do not
cite the physics literature on Ising models. Similarly, physics journals until
a few years ago ignored the 1971 Schelling publication [7], though recently
physicists extended via Ising simulations the Schelling model to cases with
T increasing with time [8] and involving more than two groups of people [9].
However, applications of the Ising model to social questions are quite old
[11].

In the following section we point out an artifact in the old Scheling model
and a simple remedy for it, coming from the rule how to deal with people
surrounded by equal numbers of liked and disliked neighbours. We explain in
the next section in greater detail the standard Ising simulation methods using
the language of human segregation. Then we present two new models. One
takes into account that human interactions, in contrast to particles in physics,
can be asymmetric: If a man loves a woman it may happen that she does not
love him, while in Newtonian physics actio = –reactio: An apple falls down
because Earth attracts the apple and the apple attracts Earth. The other
model introduces holes (empty residences) similar to the original Schelling
work, with symmetric interactions. Also, we check for sharp transitions and
smooth interfaces in a Schelling-type model.

2 Artifact in Schelling model

In Schelling’s 1971 model, each site of a square lattice is occupied by a
person from group A, or a person from group B, or it is empty. People like to
have others of the same group among their eight (nearest and next-nearest)
neighbours and require that “no fewer than half of one’s neighbors be of the
same” group (counting only occupied sites as neighbouring people). Thus,
if a person has as many A as B neighbours, then in the Schelling model
that person does not yet move to another site. Imagine now the following
conﬁguration with 12 people from group B surrounded by A on all sides:

3

A A A A A A A A
A A A A A A A A
A A A B B A A A
A A B B B B A A
A A B B B B A A
A A A B B A A A
A A A A A A A A
A A A A A A A A

In this case not a single B has a majority of A neighbours, and all A have
a majority of A neighbours. Thus none would ever move, and the above
conﬁguration is stable. (Similar artifacts are known from Ising models at
zero temperature [10].) One can hardly regard the above conﬁguration as
segregation when 8 out of 12 B people have a balanced neighbourhood of
four A and four B neighbours each. And this small cluster does not grow
into a large B ghetto. Also larger conﬁgurations with this property can be
invented. In fact, at a vacancy concentration of 30 % and starting from a
random distribution our simulations gave only small domains, with no major
changes after about 10 iterations.

To prevent this artifact one should in the case of equally many A and B
neighbours allow with 50 percent probability the person to move to another
place; and we will implement such a probabilistic rule later.

3 Ising model

Fossett [2] reviews the explanations of segregation by preference of the in-
dividuals or by discrimination from the outside.
In Schelling’s model [1],
preference alone could produce segregation, but in reality also discrimina-
tion can play a role. For example, Nazi Germany established Jewish ghettos
by force in many conquered cities. A simple Ising model without interactions
between people can incorporate discrimination with a ﬁeld h. We assume that
a site which is updated in a computer algorithm is occupied with probability
pA proportional to exp(h) by a person from group A, and with probability
pB ∝

h) by a B person. Properly normalized we have
pB = e−h/(eh + e−h)

pA = eh/(eh + e−h),

exp(

NA)/N of all A and B people in large
for the relative diﬀerence M = (NB −
lattices with N sites. There is no need for any computer simulations in this
simple limit without interactions between people. In reality, one may have
a discrimination with positive h in one part of the lattice and negative h in
the rest of the lattice, leading to segregation by discrimination.

Now we generalize the ﬁeld to include besides this discrimination h also
the interactions of site i with its four nearest neighbours, of which nA are of
type A and nb = 4

nA are of type B:

−

hi = (nA −

nB)/T ′ + h

where T ′ is the tolerance towards neighbours from the other group; now also
the probabilities

pA(i) = eh

i /(eh

i + e−hi),

pB(i) = e−hi/(eh

i + e−hi)

depend on the site i. This deﬁnes the standard Ising model on the square
lattice; of course many variations have been simulated since around 1960,
and theoretical arguments showed Tc = 2/ ln(1 + √2)
2.2. Thus for all
T ′ below Tc at h = 0 the population separates into large B-rich and A-rich
M)/2, whose size increases towards inﬁnity
domains with composition (1
with time, while for T ′ > Tc no such “inﬁnitely” large domains are formed.
Thus we now deﬁne T = T ′/Tc such that for T < 1 we have segregation
and for T > 1 we have mixing, at zero ﬁeld. Schelling starts with random
conﬁgurations but then uses more deterministic rules, analogous to T = 0.
However, only for T < 1 this spatial separation leads to domains growing to
inﬁnity for inﬁnite times on inﬁnite lattices.

≃

±

For positive h, the equilibrium population always has A as majority and
B as minority. If we start with a A majority but make h small but negative,
then the system may stay for a long time with an A majority until it suddenly
“turns” [2] into a stronger B majority: Nucleation in metastable states, like
the creation of clouds if the relative humidity exceeds 100 percent (in a pure
atmosphere).

(Physicists call the above method the heat bath algorithm; alternatives
are the Glauber and the Metropolis algorithms. The choice of algorithms
aﬀects how fast the system reaches equilibrium and how one speciﬁc conﬁg-
uration looks like, but the average equilibrium properties are not aﬀected.
That remains mostly true also if in Kawasaki kinetics these updates of single
sites are replaced by exchanging the people on two diﬀerent sites. In contrast,

5

if the lattice is diluted by adding empty sites as in [1], then the transition T
may be diﬀerent from 1.)

Of course, this Ising model is a gross simpliﬁcation of reality, but these
simpliﬁcations emphasise the reasons for spontaneous segregation. As stated
on page 210 of Fossett [2]: “Any choice to seek greater than proportionate
contact with co-ethnics necessarily diminishes the possibility for contact with
out-groups and increases spatial separation between groups; the particular
motivation behind the choice (i.e., attraction vs. aversion) may be a matter
of perspective and in any case is largely beside the point.”

4 Modiﬁcations

4.1 Asymmetric simulations

In the above model, the rules are completely symmetric with respect to A and
B. Fossett [2] reviews the greater willingness of the minority B in American
racial relations to mix with the majority A, compared with the willingness
of A to accept B neighbours. This we now try to simulate by moving away
from physics and by assuming that A is more inﬂuenced by B than B is
inﬂuenced by A. Thus if in the above rule, 3 or 4 of the neighbours are A,
then pA(i) = pB(i) = 1/2. Mathematically, eq.(3) is replaced by

hi = min(0, nA −

nB)/T + h

(5)

in our modiﬁcation. The neutral case of probabilities 1/2 then occurs if A is
replaced by B, or B is replaced by A, in a predominantly A neighborhood.

7

Now the previous sharp transition at T = 1, h = 0 vanishes: Fig.1 shows
smooth curves of M versus T for h = 0, and Fig.2 shows smooth curves of
M versus h at three ﬁxed T . Maybe this smooth behaviour is judged more
realistic by sociology. No segregation into large domains happens, and in
contrast to the symmetric Ising model of the preceding section, the results
are the same whether we start with everybody A or everybody B.

4.2 Empty spaces

Schelling had to introduce holes (= empty residences) on his lattices since he
did now allow a B person to become A or vice versa (via moving to another
city) and moved only one person at a time (not letting two people exchange
residences). Now we check if holes destroy the sharp transition between
self-organised segregation and no such segregation. In physics this is called
“dilution”, and if the holes are ﬁxed in space one has “quenched” dilution.

In this case the fraction of randomly placed holes must stay below 0.407 to
give segregation into “inﬁnitely” large domains; for larger hole concentration
the lattice separates into ﬁxed ﬁnite neighbourhoods of people, separated
by holes, such that inﬁnite domains are impossible (“percolation” [12]). For
housing in cities, it is more realistic to assume that holes are not ﬁxed: An
empty residence is occupied by a new tenant who leaves elsewhere the old
residence empty; physicists call this “annealed dilution”.

Thus besides A and B sites we have holes (type C) of concentration x,

other group, i.e. A exchanges sites with B.

We also replaced the nA −

nB in eq.(3) by the changes in the number of
“wrong” neighbours. Thus we calculate the number ∆ of A-B neighbour pairs
before and after the attempted move, and make this move with a probability
∆/T ′); no overall discrimination h was applied. Thus

and B equally does not like A neighbours, while both do not care whether a
neighbouring residence is empty or occupied by people of the same group.

Now the total number of A, B and C sites is constant, and a quantity
like the above M no longer is useful. Inspection of small lattices shows that
again for low T large domains are formed, while for large T they are not
formed. To get a more precise border value for T , we let A change into B
1.2 we found that one of the two groups
and B change into A. Then for T

(randomly selected) is completely replaced by the other, while for T
they both coexist.

4.3 Schelling at positive T

Now we simulate a model closer to Schelling’s original version, but at T > 0,
while Schelling dealt with the deterministic motion at T = 0. Thus the
neighbourhood now includes eight intead of four sites, i.e. besides the four
nearest-neighbours we also include the four next-nearest (diagonal) neigh-
bours. Let ns(i) and nd(i) be at any moment the numbers of same and
diﬀerent neighbours, respectively, for site i, without counting holes, and let
sign be the function sign(k) =1 for k > 0, = 0 for k = 0 and =
1 for k < 0.
A person at site i has an “eﬀort”

−

Ei = sign[nd(i)

ns(i)]

.

−

(6)

Analogously, Ej is based on the numbers of neighbours of the same and
the diﬀerent type if the person would actually move into residence j.
In
Schelling’s T = 0 limit, nobody would move away from i if Ei < 0 and
nobody would move into an empty site j with Ej > 0; instead, people with
Ei > 0 move into the nearest vacancy j with Ej ≤
In reality, one cannot always get what one wants and may have to move
into a “bad” neighbourhood. Thus at positive “temperature” T we assume

physics sense, and thus this model is not of the Ising type.)

Starting in the upper half of the system with one group and in the lower
half with the other group, Fig.7 shows for T < T c how the interface between
these to initial domains ﬁrst widens but then remains limited.

5 Discussion

The similarities between the Schelling and Ising models have been exploited
to introduce into the Schelling model the equivalent of the temperature T .
This turns out to be a crucial ingredient since it ensures that in the presence
of additional random factors the segregation eﬀect can disappear totally in a
quite abrupt way. Thus cities or neighbourhoods that are currently strongly
polarized may be transformed into an uniformly mixed area by tiny changes

13

in the external conditions: school integration, ﬁnancial rewards, citizen cam-
paigns, sport centers, common activities, etc. One-dimensional models, like
some of Schelling’s work, are problematic since at positive T the Ising and
many other models do not have a phase transition, while they have one in
two and more dimensions.

Besides reviewing the Ising model for non-physicists, we introduced a
few modiﬁcations to it. Together with those of [8, 9] they are only some
of the many possible modiﬁcations one could simulate. Some conﬁrm the
result of Schelling, that even without any outside discrimination, the personal
preferences can lead to self-organised segregation into large domains of either
mainly A or mainly B people. Other modiﬁcations or high T (temperature,
tolerance, trouble) prevent this segregation. Thus humans, like milk and
honey, are complicated but some of their behaviour can be simulated.

The Schelling model is a nice example how research could have progressed
better by more interdisciplinary cooperation between social and natural sci-
ences, and we hope that our paper helps in this direction.

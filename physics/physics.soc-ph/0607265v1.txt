Abstract

The expOU stochastic volatility model is capable of reproducing fairly well most important

statistical properties of ﬁnancial markets daily data. Among them, the presence of multiple time

scales in the volatility autocorrelation is perhaps the most relevant which makes appear fat tails in

the return distributions. This paper wants to go further on with the expOU model we have studied

in Ref. [1] by exploring an aspect of practical interest. Having as a benchmark the parameters

estimated from the Dow Jones daily data, we want to compute the price for the European option.

This is actually done by Monte Carlo, running a large number of simulations. Our main interest

is to “see” the eﬀects of a long-range market memory from our expOU model in its subsequent

European call option. We pay attention to the eﬀects of the existence of a broad range of time

scales in the volatility. We ﬁnd that a richer set of time scales brings to a higher price of the option.

This appears in clear contrast to the presence of memory in the price itself which makes the price

of the option cheaper.

INTRODUCTION

The model, suggested by Bachelier in 1900 as an ordinary random walk and redeﬁned

in its ﬁnal version by Osborne in 1959 [2], presupposes a constant “volatility” σ, that is

to say, a constant diﬀusion coeﬃcient D = σ2. However, and especially after the 1987

crash, there seems to be empirical evidence, embodied in the so-called “stylized facts”, that

the assumption of constant volatility does not properly account for important features of

markets [3, 4, 5]. It is not a deterministic function of time either (as might be inferred by

the evidence of non stationarity in ﬁnancial time series) but a random variable. In its more

general form one therefore may assume that the volatility σ is a given function of a random

process Y (t), i.e., σ(t) = φ(Y (t)).

At late eighties diﬀerent stochastic volatity (SV) models [Brownian motion with random

diﬀusion coeﬃcient] were presented for giving a better price to the options somewhat ignoring

their ability to reproduce the real price time series [6]. More recently SV models have

been suggested by some physicists as good candidates to account for the so-called stylized

facts of speculative markets [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. In the context of mathematical ﬁnance,

we mainly have three models: the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) [11], the Heston [8] and the

exponential Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model [7]. We have recently tried to decide which model

works better [9, 10]. Very recently we have studied the exponential Ornstein-Uhlenbeck

stochastic volatility model [7] and observed that the model shows a multiscale behavior in

the volatility autocorrelation [1]. It also exhibits a leverage correlation and a probability

proﬁle for the stationary volatility which are consistent with market observations. All these

features seem to make the model more complete than other stochastic volatility models also

based on a two-dimensional diﬀusion. It is worth to mention that there has been some more

sophisiticated models based on a three-dimensional diﬀusion process that reproduce the

intrincate set of memories in market dynamics [14, 15]. Indeed, coming from multifractality

framework, there are recent nice papers [17] with promising features to provide even a better

description that the one by the common stochastic volatility models [18].

II. THE VOLATILITY MODEL

Let us brieﬂy summarize the main deﬁnitions and the properties of the exponential

Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic volatility model [1]. The model consists in a two-dimensional

diﬀusion process given by the following pair of Itˆo stochastic diﬀerential equations (SDEs):

˙X(t) = meY (t)ξ1(t)

˙Y (t) =

αY (t) + kξ2(t),

−

where dots represent time derivative. The variable X(t) is the undrifted log-price or zero-
mean return deﬁned as ˙X = ˙S(t)/S(t)

, where S(t) is a the asset price. The

˙S(t)/S(t)

− D

E

parameters α, m, and k appearing in Eq. (2) are positive and nonrandom quantities. The

two noise sources of the process are correlated Wiener processes, i.e., ξi(t) are zero-mean

Gaussian white noise processes with cross correlations given by

where ρii = 1, ρij = ρ (i

= j,

σ(t) = meY (t).

It is worth to mention that multifractals models also considers a random variable which

describes the logarithm of the volatility [17, 18].

Among the most important results of the expOU, we must stress the following three [1].

sistent with empirical data [5]

where β = k2/2α. Notice that the stationary distribution broadens the tails as we increase

the value of β. Secondly, we have the leverage eﬀect [5]

As one can observe the characteristic time scale for the long time might be associated to

1/α while short time scale in leverage is related to 1/k2 (see Fig. 1). The distance between

the smallest time scale and the largest is given by β = k2/2α > 1. The bigger β, the larger

is the distance and the richer is the cascade of multiple time scales of the process. Even

more, as we enlarge the distance between smaller time scale and larger time scale, we also

get a broader lognormal distribution (cf. Eq. (5)) for the volatility and a fatter distribution

fo the returns.

III. OPTION PRICING

Having in mind latter expressions and main messages concerning β, we can start looking

at the inferrences of the volatility long range memory in the option price. An European

option is a ﬁnancial instrument giving to its owner the right but not the obligation to buy

(European call) or to sell (European put) a share at a ﬁxed future date, the maturity time

T , and at a certain price called exercise or striking price K. In fact, this is the most simple

of a large variety of derivatives contracts. In a certain sense, options are a security for the

investor thus avoiding the unpredictable consequences of operating with risky speculative

stocks.

The payoﬀ of the European call contract at maturity date T is

S(T )

K if S(T ) > K,

and 0 otherwise.

−

To compute the price of the call we can use the average (on an equivalent martingale measure)

over a large set of simulated paths which can be written mathematically as follows

CT (S) = E∗

e−rT (S(T )

K)+

S(t = 0) = S

.

(cid:12)

(11)

To do so we assume the process deﬁned in the pair of Eqs. (1)-(2) but with a drift equal to

the risk free interest ratio r and with a market price of risk for the volatility component set

to be 0. That is: keeping the current measure for the dynamics of the volatility. There are

many subtleties behind the evaluation of the volatility market price of risk and we address

the reader to the book by Fouque et al. [6] to get a deeper knowledge on this issue.

We thus simulate the random path assuming one day timesteps. Figure 2 shows the

diﬀerent paths observed for the SV model and the log-Brownian one using m as a volatility

o diﬀusion coeﬃcient (cf. Eq.( 4)). Repeating the paths 1,000,000 times over the same time

window, we can get an approximate idea of the correction to the classic Black-Scholes price

formula. We recall that Black-Scholes assumes a log-Brownian motion for the underlying

whose price is well-known and has the analytical solution:

In contrast with some contributions from mathematical ﬁnance, we are not inserting the

parameters values blindly nor providing a large collection of parameters where it is quite

hard to intuit the meaning and the eﬀects of each parameters. We take the parameters set

in Ref. [1] for the Dow Jones daily index as a benchmark. The parameters derived gives an

opposite approach to the one already performed by Fouque etal. [7] for the expOU. They are

focused in analytical asymptotic results with the cases where β < 1 but the problem is that

with this restriction one does not have the desired cascade of time scales in the volatility

autocorrelation.

We recall that m is the volatility level assuming no auxilary diﬀusion process for the

volatility, ρ gives the asymetry between positive and negative return change and the appro-

priate sign for the leverage eﬀect. And ﬁnally, short range memory time scale is measured

by k2 which appears to be of the order of few weeks (10-20 days). We will now focus on the
eﬀect of the largest time scale memory α−1 which is considered to be of the order of years.

We have shown in Ref. [1] that a good approximate solution for reproduce the memories of

become very noisy for β around 10.

The comparison between shortest and largest time scale is provided with β and at least for

the Dow Jones daily data this is around 3.8.

In Figure 3 we plot the call price for several values of β averaging over the initial volatility

with the lognormal distribution (5). We take maturity date at 20 days and we represent the

option assuming that the risk free interest ratio to 5% per year. Even for such a small time

horizon (much smaller than the volatility memory), we get important price diﬀerences. And

in any case the longer the memory is the more expensive is the option. This can also be

quantiﬁed by the relative price between new option price and the Black-Scholes one, that is:

Relative diﬀerence =

C(S, t)
CBS(S, t) −

1

(15)

The results are plotted in Fig. 4. One observe that the price diﬀerence becomes more

important with a monotonic increase in terms of β. These diﬀerences may become relatively

very important for small moneyness S/K. And the decay of the relative diﬀerence for larger

distances with respect to the striking price K is becoming slowler with a higher value of β.

We have tested the results with diﬀerent maturity dates and with diﬀerent values for k, ρ,

and m with similar conclusions.

In a previous paper [19], we also have been studying the eﬀects of the memory in the option

price. In that case, however, we had memory in the price itself breaking the eﬃcient market

hypothesos. We had observed that the call became cheaper with this kind of memory even

This paper has aimed to insist in the fact that the memory persistence in volatility aﬀects

the price making this to be higher.

We study the Greek and Roman mythology using the network theory. We construct a directed
network by using a dictionary of Greek and Roman mythology in which the nodes represent the
entries listed in the dictionary and we make directional links from an entry to other entries that
appear in its explanatory part. We ﬁnd that this network is clearly not a random network but a
directed scale-free network. Also measuring the various quantities which characterize the mythology
network, we analyze the Greek and Roman mythology and compare it to other real networks.

focused on the
researches are
widespread complex systems such as biological, social,
technological, economic, and communications systems
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Such complex systems can be rep-
resented by the complex network which is composed of
nodes which represent the diverse elements in the sys-
tem and links by which the elements are connected if
there are various interactions between them. For exam-
ple, in a social acquaintance network nodes are individu-
als, links are connections between friends. In the World-
Wide-Web(WWW) network nodes are web pages, links
are hyper-links between them. Especially, in the WWW
network, hyper-links have directions so it is called a di-
rected network.

The complex networks are characterized by some topo-
logical and geometrical properties such as small-world,
high degree of clustering, and scale-free topology. The
small-world property denotes that the average path
length L which is the average shortest path length be-
tween vertex pairs in a network, is small. It grows log-
arithmically with the network size N . The clustering
structure in a network is measured by the clustering co-
eﬃcient C which is deﬁned as the fraction of pairs be-
tween the neighbors of a vertex that are the neighbors of
each other. The high degree of clustering indicates that
if vertices A and B are linked to vertex C then A and B
are also likely to be linked to each other. The scale-free
(SF) topology reﬂects that the degree distribution P (k)
follows a power law, P (k) ∼ k−γ, where degree k is the
number of edges attached to a vertex and γ is the de-
gree exponent. Such network is called the SF network in
which there are vertices of high degree which produces
strong eﬀects. Also recent attention has been focused on
the hierarchical structure and the cyclic topology. A hi-
erarchical structure appears in some real networks and it
has been clariﬁed by a power-law behavior of the cluster-
ing coeﬃcient C(k) as a function of the degree k [7]. This
indicates that the networks are fundamentally modular.

It is an origin of the high degree of clustering of the net-
works. The cyclic topology is determined by loops with
various sizes which can aﬀect the delivery of informa-
tion, transport process, and epidemic spreading behavior
[8]. The cyclic coeﬃcient R which considers the loops of
all sizes from three up to inﬁnity is deﬁned as the aver-
age of the local cyclic coeﬃcient ri over all the vertices
[9]. A local cyclic coeﬃcient ri for a vertex i is deﬁned
as the average of the inverse size of the smallest loop
that connects the vertex i and its two neighbor vertices,
1
i.e., ri =
where < lm > is for all
Si
lm
the pairs of the neighbors of the vertex i and Si
lm is the
smallest size of the closed path that passes through the
vertex i and its two neighbor vertices l and m. The cyclic
coeﬃcient has a value between zero and 1/3. R=0 means
that the network has a perfect tree-like structure with-
out having any loops. Meanwhile if all the neighbor pairs
of the vertices have direct links to each other, then the
cyclic coeﬃcient becomes R=1/3. The larger the cyclic
coeﬃcient R is, the more cyclic the network is.

Applications of the network analysis to the real sys-
tems have gradually broaden from the systems whose
network structures are obviously exposed, for examples,
trains [10], subways [11], airports [12], and internet com-
munities [13], to the systems whose network structures
are relatively hidden, for examples, language [14], seis-
mology [15], jazz [16], tango [17], comics [18], dolphins
[19]. The complex network analysis provides a new suc-
cessful standpoint to a wide range of real-life systems.
Reversely, the studies of real-life networks are provided
as basic data to construct the general theory of complex
networks. Thus the studies for a variety of real-world
systems using network analysis is very important.

In this paper, we study the Greek and Roman mythol-
ogy (GRM) which is a reﬂection of human-life using the
network analysis. By using a GRM dictionary we con-
struct a directed mythology network in which the nodes
correspond to myth characters and two nodes are linked
when the corresponding characters have a relationship in
the myth. We analyze the GRM by surveying the var-
ious properties for the GRM network and compare the
myth-world network to other real-world networks.

to a single culture group which frequently feature both
anthropomorphic or theriomorphic divine ﬁgures, heros,
or animals. The GRM becomes the patterns upon which
Freudian psychiatrists base their interpretation of human
behavior; painters, composers, sculptors and writers, de-
liberately or unconsciously, imitate the mythical patterns
of the past. Myth furnishes us more than a repertoire of
literary plots and themes. The GRM has been recounted
by hundreds of writers throughout the world over the
course of nearly three thousand years.
It incorporates
vast myth-tale motifs in which so many myth characters
are connected each other. The mythic world constitute a
mythic-social network composed of myth characters and
connections between them.

The dictionary of classical mythology by M. Grant and
J. Hazel [20] is a biographical dictionary including the ex-
tensive Greek and Roman mythological characters, from
major deities to the lesser-known nymphs. It includes,
as 1647 entries, gods, heros, monsters, mortals, fairies.
Each entry has an biographical explanatory part in which
other entries are referred to. In the mythology network
we construct, the nodes correspond to the entries of the
dictionary, and an outgoing link is formed from an entry
to the other which appears in the explanatory part of the
former, while an incoming link is formed from an entry
to the entry referred by the former. That is, outgoing
links of ’refer to’ and incoming links of ’referred by’ on
the dictionary are made. The entry Acacallis, as an ex-
ample, has the explanatory part as ”Daughter of Minos
and Pasiphae. She bore Apollo a son, Amphithemis, and
perhaps Miletos also.” Acacallis has directed links to the
ﬁve entries, Minos, Pasiphae, Apollo, Amphithemis, and
Miletos. Also, if the linked entries refer to Acacallis in
their explanatory part opposite-directed links are formed
between them. Figure 1 shows the connection of Acacal-
lis to its ﬁve neighbors. There are bi-directional links be-
tween Acacallis and Minos, Miletos, and Amphithemis,
while links between Acacallis and Pasiphae and Apollo
are mono-directional. It results from that the explana-
tory parts of Minos, Miletos, and Amphithemis refer to
Acacallis, while those of Pasiphae and Apollo do not refer
to Acacallis. In this way, the node Acacallis has in-dgree
kin = 3 and out-degree kout = 5 which are the number of

links incoming upon it and outgoing from it, respectively.
Thus we construct the directed mythology network where
the number of nodes, total in-links (out-links), and total
undirected links are 1637, 6687 and 8938 respectively.
Here total undirected links are counted in the undirected
network where we neglect the direction of links so two en-
tries are connected if they refer to or refer by each other.
The diﬀerence between the numbers of total undirected
links and total directional links is same as the number of
unilateral references in the dictionary.

We measure the degree distribution of the GRM net-
work by using the cumulative degree distribution func-
tion. The cumulative degree distribution function Pc(k)
is the probability that a randomly selected node has over
k links, i.e., Pc(k) = P∞
k′≥k P (k′) . The cumulative dis-
tribution also follows power-law, but with exponent γ − 1
rather than exponent γ, so that Pc(k) ∼ k−γ+1. We
measured the out-degree, the in-degree, and the total-

degree distributions. The plots of the cumulative out-
degree and in-degree distribution functions as a function
of the out-degree and the in-degree are shown in Fig.2 (a)
and (b), respectively. The slopes of the straight guide
lines are 1.93 and 1.49, which represents that the out-
degree and the in-degree exponents are γout ≈ 2.93 and
γin ≈ 2.49. Thus we found that the GRM network is a
directed scale-free network, which means that all charac-
ters do not play an equal role and some characters play
an more central role than other characters in the Greek
and Roman mythic world. Also we obtained the values
of degree exponent γ ≈ 2.61 in the undirected network
as shown in Fig. 3.

Table I shows seven most connected entries with the
corresponding numbers of out-degrees, in-degrees, and
undirected-degrees in order of ranks. We found that
Heracles ranks the ﬁrst with 140 outgoing links for out-
degrees, while Zeus ranks the ﬁrst with 223 incom-
ing links and 243 undirected links for in-degrees and
undirected-degrees. In the GRM network, the fact that
a nodes has more links than other nodes means that its
corresponding myth character appears more frequently in
myth tales. Heracles has the most outgoing links, which
means that he appears as a leading character in many dif-
ferent myth tales. On the one hand Zeus who has most
incoming links most frequently appears as a supporting
character in diﬀerent myth tales. Also we notice that
the characters well known to the mass of the people hold
high ranks on the whole.

For the undirected GRM network, we measure vari-
ous quantities which characterize the network. First, we
obtained the average path length L = 3.47 and the clus-
tering coeﬃcient C = 0.41. Comparing these values with
the random network of the same number of nodes and
links for which the values of the average shortest path
length and the clustering coeﬃcient are 6.86 and 0.0034,
we ﬁnd that the GRM network has the small-world prop-
erty and high degree of clustering as the other various
complex networks. The small-world eﬀect also underlies
some well-known parlar games, particularly the calcu-
lation of Erd¨os numbers [21]. Similarly, we measured
Heracles numbers and Zeus numbers of the nodes. Her-
acles(Zeus) number of a node is deﬁned as the shortest

path length between the node and Heracles(Zeus). The
Heracles(Zeus) numbers range from 0(himself) to 7(6)
and the average Heracles(Zeus) number of the network is
2.18(2.11).

Figure 4 shows the log-log plot of the clustering coef-
ﬁcient C(k) versus the degree k. The straight guide line
represents that C(k) follows a power-law, C(k) ∼ k−β
with β ≈ 0.63. It means that the GRM network forms
a hierarchical structure. We also measured the cyclic co-
eﬃcient R and obtained R ≈ 0.23. Figure 5 shows the
plot of the distribution of local cyclic coeﬃcient. There
are the ﬁrst and second peaks at r = 0 and r = 1/3
and two peaks have almost equivalent values. This result
represents that there are many tree-like and triangular
patterns in the GRM networks. It is diﬀerent from the
network structures of the other real-networks where the
only one between tree-like and triangular pattern is cer-
tainly dominant [9]. While, except for r = 0, it is similar
to that of the movie actor network [22] in which nodes
are actors and two nodes are linked if the correspond-
ing actors have acted in the same movie together.
It
reﬂects the biographical nature of the mythology dictio-
nary: two entries have high possibilities of appearance
in the explanatory parts of each other when the corre-
sponding characters have jointly appeared in the same
myth story as two actors have costarred in a same ﬁlm.
That is, although the GRM network is constructed by
using a biographical dictionary, the GRM network can
be regarded as a kind of a social network.

In summary, we studied the relationship among charac-
ters appeared in the GRM with the help of the latest com-
plex network theory. By using the biographical dictio-
nary of GRM, we constructed the directed GRM network
in which the nodes correspond to the entries(mythology
characters) and a directional link was made from an en-
try A to an entry B when the entry B was appeared in
the explanatory part of the entry A. It was founded that
the GRM network is a scale-free network and has prop-

erties such as the small-world and high degree of cluster-
ing. Also by measuring the clustering coeﬃcient C(k),
we found that the GRM network forms a hierarchical
structure. The distribution of local cyclic coeﬃcient tell
us that the GRM network is a social-like network such as
the movie actor network as well as a dictionary network.

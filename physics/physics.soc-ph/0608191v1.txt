The average behaviour of ﬁnancial market
by 2 scale homogenisation

IPPT, Polska Akademia Nauk

The ﬁnancial market is nonpredictable, as according to the Bachelier,
the mathematical expectation of the speculator is zero. Nevertheless, we
observe in the price ﬂuctuations the two distinct scales, short and long time.
Behaviour of a market in long terms, such as year intervals, is diﬀerent from
that in short terms.

A diﬀusion equation with a time dependent diﬀusion coeﬃcient that
describes the ﬂuctuations of the ﬁnancial market, is subject to a two-scale
homogenisation, and long term characteristics of the market such as mean
behaviour of price and variance, are obtained. We indicate also that intro-
duction of convolution into diﬀusion equation permits to obtain L- stable
behaviour of ﬁnance.

1. Introduction

The prices on stock market are formed as a result of superposition of
large number of diﬀerent reasons and can be assumed to be governed by
probability laws. The ﬂuctuations of prices on stock market resemble an
errating walk, as it was indicated yet in 1900 by Louis Bachelier [1], when
he derived the diﬀusion equation from a condition that speculators should
receive no information from the past prices. The diﬀerence of action prices
x = x(t)
p(t), observed at two time moments t and t + ∆t,
plays in this diﬀusion equation role of independent spatial variable. Hence,
the motion of prices on the ﬁnancial market is similar to the brownian
movement, discovered by the biologiste Robert Brown [2] and analysed by
Albert Einstein [3,4] and Marian Smoluchowski [5-7], cf. also [8]. Bachelier’s
observation did not ﬁnd large recognition at his life, but now is a basis of
greater part of modeles of prices, especially the Black-Scholes model [9], cf.
also [10]. Later Paul A. Samuelson [11] indicated that instead of a simple

p(t + ∆t)

diﬀerence (1) it is more proper to consider diﬀerences of the respective
logarithms x = ln p(t + ∆t)

ln p(t).

However, as it was indicated by Benoit Mandelbrot [12], despite the
fundamental importance of Bachelier’s random walk of the price changes
(one cannot imagine an advanced textbook on ﬁnances without the brownian
motion description as its starting point), the empirical samples of successive
diﬀerences of stock price changes gathered from 1890 year, are not normally
distributed: they are usually too peaked to be Gaussian and do not have
ﬁnite variance. The distribution of price changes is leptokurtic, since the
sample kurtosis is much greater than 3, the value for a normal distribution.
Mandelbrot regarded that the price changes belong to the stable family of
distributions, known as L-stable or L´evy-Pareto distributions. Mandelbrot
and Wallis [13] distinguished two non-Gaussian kinds of events observed
in the economic world: isolated catastrophic events, the Noah eﬀect which
refers to abrupt and discontinuous changes in speculative time series and
regular alternations of good and bad series, termed the Joseph eﬀect.

Besides those eﬀects with stochastic non-gaussian origin, another type of
departure from normal distribution is observed when the irregular random
behaviour of stock price changes is superposed on another regular periodic
pattern. There is a deﬁnite evidence of periodic behaviour of price changes
corresponding to intervals of a day, week, quarter and year, according to
the rhytm of human activity. Maury Osborne [14] indicates, for example,
that there is a reproducible burst of trading at the beginning and the end
of trading day. While diurnal cycle is almost obvious, a somewhat more
subtle statistical analysis (χ2 test) reveals a week periodicity in the daily
across-the-market dispersion of stock price changes. This price dispersion is
a maximum at middle of week, what can be interpreted that traders tend to
forget the market business over a long week-end and make up their minds
at the beginning of new week.

At the beginning of the present paper, we outline some properties of
diﬀusion equation with nonhomogeneous coeﬃcient (dependent on time t
or price changes x) and describe its solutions as the Gauss and L´evy types.
We also propose to use a two scale homogenisation method to describe an
average behaviour of a ﬁnancial market in a long time or in averaged market
in the case in which the diﬀusion coeﬃcient depends on stock price change.

Function f gives the probability density of ﬁnding Brownian particle at
position x at time t, and D denotes the coeﬃcient of diﬀusion. According
to the Einstein ﬂuctuational dissipative relation D
T /η, the coeﬃcient D
is proportional to a quotient of the absolute temperature T and viscosity η,
and if η does not depend on T , it is simply proportional to T .

∼

The form of Eq.(1) admits dependence of the coeﬃcient D on x which
may be realized e.g. by dependence of T on x. If D is a function of time
D = D(t) only, or if it is constant, the following form is obtained

∂f
∂t

= D

∂2f
∂x2

Depending on interpretation, the coeﬃcient D denotes either the thermal
diﬀusivity (quotient of the heat condictivity and proper heat) or the diﬀu-
sion coeﬃcient. The last meaning is used below.

According to Bachelier’s observation, the time independent variable t
in diﬀusion equation is measured by successive nuber of stock transactions
and the independent variable x, denotes stock action price change. The
coeﬃcient D varies according to a market temperature, cf. [15].

2.1. Fick’s equations

Let f = f (x, t) be the probability density of ﬁnding a brownian (B.)
particle at point x and at time t, and let j = j(x, t) be a stream of B.
particles. The continuity (or balance) equation describes conservation of
the number of B. particles

2.2. Steady diﬀusion in temperature gradient

Let a diﬀusion in a slab 0

presence of an external force F , when the concentration within the diﬀusion
volume does not change with respect to time (j = constant), the Fick ﬁrst
law has a form

ture distribution T = Ax + B, we obtain

f = C(Ax + B)F/A

3. Time dependent coeﬃcient of diﬀusion

3.1. Periodic time dependence of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient

As it was said it is observed a periodic oscillation of the across-the-
market dispersion of price change for time intervals (day, week, and so on).
As the dispersion is proportional to the diﬀusion coeﬃcient D, it means
that D is a periodic function of time.

Therefore, let D(t) be a function of time with period T . For t = nT ,

with a whole number n, we have

We observe in more coarse time units the classical brownian movement

3.2. 2 scale time homogenisation of the brownian motion of stock prices

To the analogous result we arrive applying more general method of
asymptotic homogenisation, cf. [17, 18]. We introduce two time variables t
and τ measured in diﬀerent scales, it is in diﬀerent units of time. The time
t is measured by a slow clock and time τ by a fast (more accurate) clock.
We have

τ =

where the scale parametr ε is positive (ε > 0) and small. For example,
6 hours) and [τ ]= hour, then
if [t] = day (the duration of a session
ε = hour/day

of time t as a slow variable.

5. Conclusions

Above we tried to ﬁnd a compromise between the classical view on ﬁ-
nance as a gaussian process and the modern view insisting on L´evy form of
stock price changes. We have shown that:
1. In the case of periodically varying standard deviation of prices, the av-
eraging over time period restitutes gaussian character of the process.
2.
L´evy distribution.

Introduction of convolution in the diﬀusion equation may lead to the

We study localization of information on scale free networks with communication constraints when,
for some reason, information can propagate only between “mutually trusted nodes” (MTN). We
propose an algorithm to construct the MTN network and show that there is a critical value ¯mc > 2
of trusted nodes below which information localizes. This critical value increases drastically if a
fraction p of nodes does not transfer information at all. We study the fraction of initial messangers
needed to inform a desired fraction of the network as a function of the average number of trusted
nodes ¯m and discuss possible applications of the model to marketing, to the spreading of risky
information and to the spreading of a disease with very short incubation time.

PACS numbers: 89.75.-k, 89.65.-s, 87.23.Ge

In scale-free networks, the number of links (“degree”)
emanating from a node follows a power law distribu-
tion, P (k) ∼ k−γ, and the observation that a large num-
ber of natural networks, in particular social and biolog-
ical networks, follow this distribution (with 2 < γ <
3) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] has stimulated research tremen-
dously. Scale-free networks exhibit the “small world”
phenomenon [7], an eﬀect which had been discovered, al-
ready 4 decades ago, by Milgram when studying the sep-
aration between individuals in the USA (“six degrees of
separation”)[8, 9]. The broad degree distribution of scale-
free networks implies the presence of a capable number of
well connected nodes (hubs) that decisively inﬂuence the
properties of the network. Due to the hubs the network
is robust against random distraction of its nodes [10],
favoring e.g. the spreading of information or epidemics
[11, 12, 13], even if the network is widely immunized.
The percolation and epidemics threshold on a scale-free
network (with 2 < γ < 3) is zero even in the case of
clustered networks [14].

As the route from one person to another is ultra-small,
we expect information and epidemics to spread very fast.
A well known example where information ﬂowed as ex-
pected is the Yom-Kippur war, where news spreaded with
very high speed without radio or TV transmissions. But
there are other cases where highly relevant information
might have remained localized contrary to any intuition.
There are still conﬂicting opinions on what the vast ma-
jority of people in Europe, and in particular in Germany,
knew [15] about the concentration camps during World
War II and it is not clear how well the people in the
former Soviet Union was informed about the gulags. In
Marketing, there are examples of products that become
famous with minimal advertisement while others remain
unknown, and only epidemics with a suﬃciently large in-
cubation time (like AIDS) seem to spread as expected.
Other cases of practical interest may include information
of economic nature, for example about a future currency
devaluation or a merger between two companies. Moti-

vated by these examples, we study here the condition for
information localization to occur.

We examine spreading phenomena in a scale-free net-
work when the transfer between nodes is constrained.
Communication constraints in a network exist when it
is not beneﬁcial for a node to share information with all
its neighbors, either because the information is risky or
because the messanger has limited resources or time to
spread the information and thus, has to select some of
his neighbors and transfer information only to them. As
a pedagogical example, we focus on the spreading and
localization of information that is relevant to everybody
and risky for the messanger. We do not deal with “spe-
ciﬁc signaling” [16] as it is not relevant to everybody or
rumor spreading [17, 18] as, in this case, the concept of
risk is absent.

We assume that when someone has information which
is dangerous for him to disclose, he will not reveal it to all
of his acquaintances but only (on the average) to those
¯m nodes of his neighbors that he trusts at most. We ﬁnd
that there exists a critical value ¯mc of “trusted nodes”
which separates information spreading from information
localization. Above ¯mc information spreads while below
¯mc it is localized. This information percolation threshold
is quite higher than intuitively expected and can increase
drastically when in addition a certain fraction p of nodes
is not willing to transfer information at all.

In a network, individuals are presented as nodes and
if two individuals have established a relationship then
they are linked, otherwise the link is absent. It has been
shown recently, that scale-free networks with γ ∼ 2.5
yield a reasonable description of the science collabora-
tion or actors networks [3], and a model of mobile agents
has been proposed for the formation of this type of so-
cial networks [19]. In our analysis, we consider scale-free
networks with three values of γ, γ = 2, 2.5 and 3 and min-
imum degrees kmin = 1 and 2. For comparison, we also
consider a real social network of an internet dating com-
munity (IDC network) [20]. Our basic assumption is that

104, γ = 2.5, kmin = 1 (open squares) and kmin = 2
(stars),respectively, and an internet dating community net-
work (IDC)with N = 14782(ﬁlled triangles) [20] for q = 1.
The critical values are: ¯mc = 2.1 (γ = 2.5 , kmin = 2),
¯mc = 2.3 (IDC network) and ¯mc = 2.8 (γ = 2.5, kmin = 1)
(b) Same as (a) but for q = 0. In this case, ¯mc = 2.7 (γ = 2.5
, kmin = 2), ¯mc = 2.9 (IDC network) and ¯mc = 3.2 (γ = 2.5,
kmin = 1) . (c) Average distance (L∞) of the nodes on the

node i chooses its trusted neighbors randomly, each one
with probability pi = mi/ki. In the case of “correlated
choice”, node i chooses its trusted neighbors in a corre-
lated way such that the friendly neighbors are selected
with a higher probability. First, only the si friendly
neighbors are considered, and selected with probability q
until the desired number of mi trusted nodes is reached.
If this is not the case yet, then, the remaining number
of trusted nodes is chosen randomly from all neighbors
ki that have not yet been selected. Figure 1 shows an il-
lustration of the selection process for the fully correlated
case q = 1. A characteristic property of the model is
that mutual trust between two hubs is diﬃcult. This can
easily be seen in the “uncorrelated” case q = 0, where
the probability that a node i with degree ki and a node j
with degree kj both select each other as a trusted neigh-
bor is proportional to
and becomes negligible if the
two nodes are hubs.
The mean number of trusted neighbors ¯m per node is
the characteristic tunable parameter in the system. We
intuitively expect that for low ¯m values the MTN net-
work will be fragmented and information will be localized
while for high ¯m values (above a critical value ¯mc) a giant
component will appear where information can spread. In
the following, for the sake of simplicity, we will focus on
the uncorrelated model (q = 0) and the fully correlated

FIG. 1: Schematic illustration of the creation of the “mutually
trusted node” (MTN) network, when the number of trusted
nodes m = 3. For convenience, only the “correlated ”( q = 1)
case is shown. We consider a certain node i with 6 links (black
lines). In (a) the node has not been chosen by another node
as trusted , i.e there are no friendly nodes. In (b) there are
two (less than m) friendly nodes characterized by the blue
single arrows, while in (c) there are four (greater than m)
friendly nodes.
In (a) three of the neighbors are chosen as
trusted (single blue arrows) but mutually trusted bonds are
not yet established. In (b) the two friendly nodes are chosen
with probability q = 1 establishing mutually trusted bonds
(red double arrows) and a third trusted node is chosen (single
blue arrow). Other links are rendered inactive (green dotted
lines). In (c), three of the four friendly neighbors are chosen
as trusted nodes, establishing three mutually trusted bonds
(red double arrows). The dotted links remain inactive forever.
Information propagates only through the network of “mutu-
ally” selected nodes, the MTN network (red double arrows).

risky information can propagate only between “mutually
trusted nodes”, since risky information transfer needs (i)
trust of the receiver in the messanger for believing in it
and (ii) trust of the messanger in the receiver for not
disclosing the information to unwanted individuals.

By deﬁnition, the network of mutually trusted nodes
(MTN-network) is a subnetwork of the original network.
For constructing the MTN network sequentially, we con-
sider either a given social network or an artiﬁcial scale-
free network of N nodes with a certain exponent γ and
a certain minimum degree kmin. In each step, we choose
randomly a certain node i with ki links that has been
selected already by si ≤ ki neighboring nodes (“friendly
neighbors”) as trusted, and choose, from a Gaussian dis-
tribution of mean ¯m and width σ its number of trusted
neighbors mi. If ki ≤ mi, all neighboring nodes are se-
lected.
If ki > mi, there are diﬀerent ways of selec-
tion that depend on the weight the friendly neighbors are
given (see Fig. 1). In the case of “uncorrelated choice”,

FIG. 3: Phase diagrams for (a) q = 1 and (b) q = 0. The
log - linear plot shows the critical value of ¯m vs the proba-
bility p that a node does not share the information with its
trusted neighbors. The curves separate a phase of “informa-
tion localization” (below the curve) from a phase of “infor-
mation spreading” (above the curve). Curves are for four
random scale free networks with N = 104 nodes and γ = 2,
kmin = 1 (open triangles); γ = 3, kmin = 1 (open circles);

model (q = 1). We are interested in the transition be-
tween localization and spreading of information.

Figure 2 shows the fraction of nodes P∞ [25] that be-
long to the largest cluster as a function of ¯m for both ar-
tiﬁcial and real networks for (a) q = 1 and (b) q = 0. The
size of the largest cluster is, by deﬁnition, the maximum
number of nodes that eventually learn a risky informa-
tion from one randomly selected node. This fraction is
negligible for ¯m below a critical threshold ¯mc indicating
information localization, while there is a sharp increase
of P∞ above ¯mc indicating information spreading. The
ﬁgure remains qualitatively the same for networks of dif-
ferent γ values in the range 2 < γ < 3. The position
of the threshold ¯mc can be more accurately determined
through the condition (cid:10)k2
(cid:11) / hki = 2, where k denotes
the degree of a vertex and <> stands for the mean value
over all graph nodes [10]. For a scale-free network with
γ = 2.5 and kmin = 1, we ﬁnd ¯mc = 2.8 for q = 1 and
¯mc = 3.2 for q = 0. For γ = 2.5 and kmin = 2, we ﬁnd
¯mc = 2.1 for q = 1 and ¯mc = 2.7 for q = 0. For the IDC
network, ¯mc=2.3 for q = 1 and 2.9 for q = 0 (see also
[26]).

While P∞ is the maximum fraction of nodes that can
be informed by one node, the mean time t∞ to reach all
possible nodes is proportional to the average topological
distance L∞ between them. Figure 2(c) and (d) show
L∞, as a function of ¯m, for the same networks as in
Fig. 2(a) and 2(b), again for the correlated (q = 1) and
the uncorrelated (q = 0) model. For low values of ¯m,

work as in (a) for q = 0, (c) The internet dating community
(IDC) network (N = 14782)[20] and q = 1 and (d) the same

where the network is fragmented, P∞ is small and so is
L∞. For large values of ¯m, where the network is well
connected, L∞ is again small, exhibiting the small world
eﬀect. Near ¯mc we observe a sharp increase, indicating
the complex structure of the resulting network. In the
inset we examine how L∞ scales with the system size. We
ﬁnd a power law scaling with exponent close to 1/3 which
suggests that the information localization discussed here
belongs to the universality class of random percolation
on networks [21, 22, 23].

When a fraction p of the nodes is unwilling to reveal
information to their neighbors, the critical value ¯mc in-
creases strongly in a non-linear way, as is shown in Fig.
3. As a consequence, when p is large enough it takes un-
likely high values of ¯m in order to maintain information
ﬂow. It is interesting to note that, as in Fig. 2, the re-
sult for a random network with γ = 2.5 and kmin = 2 is
rather close to that of the internet community network
although the last has kmin = 1.

Next, we discuss the penetration of relevant (and risky)
information into the network when initially not only one
node, but a certain fraction f 0
I ≡ I0/N of nodes is in-
formed. We are interested in the fraction fI ≡ I/N of
nodes that eventually will be informed. Figure 4 shows
fI as a function of f 0
I for a random scale-free network
with γ = 2.5, kmin = 1 and N = 104 nodes and for the
IDC network for four values of ¯m, ¯m = 2, 3, 4, 5. As in
the previous ﬁgures, we distinguish between the corre-
lated (q = 1) and the uncorrelated (q = 0) model. Below
¯mc, for example for ¯m = 2, fI increases linearly with f 0
I
except for f 0
I close to one. The proportionality factor is
identical to the mean cluster size hsi, since for f 0
I ≪ 1,

I = hsi I0. As hsi is small well below ¯mc, a large frac-
tion of initially informed nodes f 0
I is needed to inform
a large fraction of the network. In contrast, for ¯m well
above ¯mc, for ¯m = 5 for example, fI shows two regimes.
A sharp increase at very small values of f 0
I is followed
by a slow increase over nearly the whole f 0
I regime. The
sharp increase is the result of the appearance of a span-
ning cluster and as a consequence, only a tiny fraction
f 0
I is needed to inform a considerable number of nodes.
The large low-slope region indicates that it is diﬃcult
to inform (nearly) all of the network. The reason for
this is that the fraction of nodes belonging to the inﬁ-
nite cluster is zero at criticality and increases as a power
law with increasing distance from the critical point [24].
Since the majority of nodes is not on the spanning clus-
ter and since at least one initially informed node in every
cluster is needed to inform the complete network, inform-
ing a large fraction of nodes may become diﬃcult even
above ¯mc. This is evident, for example, in Fig. 4 (d) for
¯m = 3 (which is above but close to ¯mc = 2.9). One can
I ≃ 6 × 10−4, fI ≃ 0.1,i.e. 10%
see that already for f 0
of the network will be informed but it needs f 0
I ≃ 0.1 in
order to inform 50% of the network.

Finally, we like to emphasize again that our results are
not only valid for transfer of risky and relevant informa-
tion but for all those cases where information from one
node is likely to be transfered only to a certain number of
neighboring nodes. This happens, for example, in prod-
uct advertisement as (i) someone who is informed of a
product will, most likely, talk about it only to those of his
acquaintances that he thinks are in need of the product
and will appreciate his suggestion (friendly neighbors)
and (ii) the receiver of the information has to validate the
messanger as a reliable person so that his suggestion is
seriously considered and further promoted. In this case,
f 0
I can be interpreted as a measure of the eﬀort needed to
promote a product, which is directly proportional to the
promotional cost, while ¯m, the average number of people
to whom a person will talk of a product, depends on the
quality of advertisement since successful advertisement
will lead to higher ¯m values. Within this interpretation,
Fig. 4 shows that there is a threshold for the quality
of advertisement. Below the threshold, the cost of in-
forming a desired fraction fI of potential consumers is
proportional to fI and high. Above the threshold, for a
very successful advertisement, a large fraction of poten-
tial consumers can be informed at minimum cost. A fur-
ther application of our model may be on the spreading of
epidemics with very short incubation time. In this case,
the epidemics can spread only through the sub-network of
those people that are really close to the contaminated in-
dividual, which is analogous to that of the MTN-network.

[25] It can be shown that, within the mean ﬁeld theory P∞
is the square root of the “connectivity measure” C of a
social network, used in sociology to describe the fragmen-
tation of a society (S. Havlin, private communication).

[26] We applied our model to four small records of criminal
acquaintance networks. Conﬁdentiality is important in
such networks, which are quite diﬀerent from an internet
dating community network. Thus, we expect diﬀerent re-
sults. Indeed, for half of these networks, ¯mc was above
6 while for the other half it was not possible to have
percolation of information at all.

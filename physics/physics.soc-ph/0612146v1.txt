We focus on the majority model in a topology consisting of two coupled fully-connected networks,
thereby mimicking the existence of communities in social networks. We show that a transition takes
place at a value of the inter-connectivity parameter. Above this value, only symmetric solutions
prevail, where both communities agree with each other and reach consensus. Below this value, in
contrast, the communities can reach opposite opinions and an asymmetric state is attained. The
importance of the interface between the sub-networks is shown.

It is well-known that social networks exhibit modular
structure of weakly coupled clusters [1]. Namely, these
networks are composed of many communities of nodes,
where the nodes of the same community are highly con-
nected, while there are few links between the nodes of
It is therefore of particular in-
diﬀerent communities.
terest to understand how well-known models of opinion
formation [2, 3, 4] behave on these realistic geometries.
It is an obvious fact [5] that the opinion or taste of users
may strongly diﬀer from one cluster to another due to the
lack of interactions between the communities. In an eco-
nomic context, for instance, it is well-known that small
cliques of core users can form a niche [6, 7] and have a
diﬀerent behaviour than the majority. As an example,
one may think of Mac users who concentrate in niche
markets like education, graphic arts and multimedia cre-
ation [8]. From a marketing point of view, the propa-
gation of opinion between diﬀerent communities is also
an important problem, due to the growing popularity of
viral marketing techniques in online social networks [9].
In order to address this problem, we will focus in this
Rapid Communication on the majority model [4] (MR,
for majority rule) applied on a simpliﬁed geometry that
mimicks community structure. MR is deﬁned as follows.
The network is composed of N T agents. Each of them
has an opinion α or β (equivalently spin) about some
question. E.g. Will you vote for the Republicans or
the Democrats [10]? Do you believe in Darwin’s theory?
Which of these two products do you want to buy?... At
each time step, G = 3 contiguous nodes are selected (the
main requirement is that G is an odd number) and the
agents in this selection all adopt the state of the local ma-
jority. This model rests on the tendency of social agents
to copy the opinion of their neighbours/friends [11, 12]
and has been shown exhibit to a rich collective behaviour
[4]. For the sake of clarity, let us ﬁrst focus on MR on
a fully connected network, i.e. any pair of nodes is con-
nected. When NT → ∞ , it is straightforward to show
that the average total number of nodes having opinion
α, denoted At, reads

At+1 = At − at(1 − 3at + 2a2

(1)
where at = At/N T is the average proportion of nodes

t ),

having opinion α. Eq.1 comes from the fact that the
probability that two nodes α (β) and one node β (α)
are selected is a2(1 − a) (a(1 − a)2), so that the total
contribution to the evolution of At is

W = a2(1 − a) − a(1 − a)2 = −a(1 − 3a + 2a2).

(2)

It is easy to show that Eq.1 possesses two stable sta-
tionary solutions a = 0 or a = 1, that correspond to
consensus states, i.e. all agents in the system have the
same opinion. The mixed solution a = 1/2, where nodes
with diﬀerent opinions coexist, is also stationary but is
unstable. Let us also insist on the fact that MR does not
involve temperature-like parameters that randomize the
opinion dynamics.

1 and N T

In order to generalize the fully-connected network and
to account for community-like structures, we introduce
coupled fully-connected networks (CFCN) deﬁned as fol-
lows. The system is composed of two fully connected
clusters 1 and 2. These two fully connected clusters
are composed of N T
2 nodes respectively. The
connection between the two structures is ensured by in-
terface nodes, denoted 0, that belong to each of the
sub-networks. By construction, the number of inter-
1 , N T
face nodes veriﬁes N0 ≤ min(N T
2 ) and the case
N0 ≪ min(N T
2 ) corresponds to a network composed
of two sparsely connected communities. In the following,
we note N1 and N2 the number of core nodes in the clus-
ters 1 and 2 respectively, where core nodes are those that
belong to only one cluster. By construction, the above
quantities satisfy

1 , N T

N0 + N1 = N T
1
N0 + N2 = N T
2 .

(3)

1 = N T

For the sake of clarity, we focus on equi-populated clus-
ters N T
2 = N . Let us also note that the total
number of nodes is N T = 2(1 − ν)N + νN = (2 − ν)N ,
where the parameter ν = N0
N is a measure of the inter-
connectivity between the communities. By construction,
the following relations hold: N0 = νN and N1 = N2 =
(1 − ν)N . Some typical realizations of CFCN can be
viewed in Fig.1.

In this Rapid Communication, we will answer the fol-
lowing question: are there values of the inter-connectivity

2

FIG. 1: CFCN with N = 20 and ν = 0.0, ν = 0.3, ν = 0.7 and ν = 1.0 (from left to right). The total number of nodes and the
number of interface nodes are given for each conﬁguration.

ν such that the co-existence of two disagreeing popula-
tions is possible? In the limiting case ν → 1, each agent
in 1 also belongs to 2 and inversely, i.e. all the agents are
interface agents N0 = N T = N , N1 = N2 = 0 and the
network reduces to one fully connected network. Conse-
quently, one expects that Eq.1 takes place and that the
system asymptotically reaches consensus: all the nodes
either reach opinion A or opinion B and co-existence is
forbidden. In contrast, when ν = 0, the two sub-clusters
are completely disconnected, N1 = N2 = N = N T /2,
N0 = 0, and evolve independently from each other.
Therefore, both sub-networks reach internal consensus
and there is a probability 1/2 that the opinion in 1 is the
same as in 2, while these opinions diﬀer otherwise. The
challenging problem is to ﬁnd how the system behaves in
the interval ν ∈]0, 1[.

Before focusing on the implementation of MR on this
network, let us shortly describe the above network struc-
ture. By construction, nodes in the core of 1 are con-
nected to N − 1 ∼ N nodes, i.e. the nodes of the core
of 1 and the interface nodes, idem for the core nodes of
2. In contrast, the nodes of the interface are connected
to any of the N T − 1 ∼ N T nodes in the whole network.
Consequently, nodes in the core of 1 have no direct link
to nodes in the core of 2, but they have an indirect con-
nection passing through any of the interface nodes. For
the sake of clarity, we will say in the following that a
node is in 1 if he is in the core of 1.

Let us introduce A0, A1 and A2, the average num-
bers of nodes α in the interface, in the core of 1 and in
the core of 2 respectively. At each time step, a node is
randomly chosen and a triplet of nodes centered around
the chosen node is randomly selected. By construction,
the probability that a node in the core of 1 is chosen is
N T = 1−ν
p1 = N1
2−ν . If this is the case, three possible triplets
may be selected:

2. The triplet involves 2 nodes in 1 and 1 node in 0

with probability p1

120 = 2(1 − ν)ν

3. The triplet involves 1 node in 1 and 2 nodes in 0

with probability p1

210 = ν2

By convention, the quantity px
ijk is the probability that
the triplet is composed of i nodes in 0, j in 1 and k in 2
(i + j + k = 3) if the central chosen node is x. It respects
the normalisation Pi+j+k=3 px

ijk = 1.

N T = 1−ν

When the chosen node is in the core of 2, with probabil-
2−ν , it is straightforward to get the values
ijk by symmetry. Finally, when the chosen node is in
2−ν , there are

ity p2 = N2
of p2
the interface, with probability p0 = N0
six possibilities:

N T = ν

1. The triplet involves 3 nodes in 0 with probability

300 = ν2
p0

(2−ν)2 .

2. The triplet involves 2 nodes in 0 and 1 node in 1
210 = 2(1−ν)ν
(2−ν)2

with probability p0

3. The triplet involves 2 nodes in 0 and 1 node in 2
201 = 2(1−ν)ν
(2−ν)2

with probability p0

4. The triplet involves 1 node in 0 and 2 nodes in 1

5. The triplet involves 1 node in 0 and 2 nodes in 2

(2−ν)2

with probability p0

6. The triplet involves 1 node in each category with

probability p0

111 = 2(1−ν)
(2−ν)2

2

Putting all these pieces together, the probability that a
triplet (i, j, k) is randomly selected during one time step
is pijk = Px pxpx
ijk and reads in detail:

1. The triplet involves 3 nodes in 1 with probability

In order to derive the coupled equations generalizing
Eq.1 for quantities the Ai, one needs to evaluate the
possible consensus processes taking place when a triplet
(i, j, k) is selected. Let us focus on the case (2, 1, 0) as an
example. In that case, the number of nodes A0, A1 and
A2 will change due to the contributions:

W0,(2,1,0) =

1
3
1
W1,(2,1,0) =
3
W2,(2,1,0) = 0

[2a0a1(1 − a0) − 2a0(1 − a1)(1 − a0)]

[a2

0(1 − a1) − a1(1 − a0)2]

where the ﬁrst line accounts for cases when one node 0
and one node 1 have the same opinion but disagree with
a node in 0, while the second line accounts for cases when
the 2 nodes in 0 have the same opinion but disagree with
the node in 1. The third line simply means that the
selection of a triplet (2, 1, 0) will not change the state
of a node in 2. The other situations (i, j, k) are treated
similarly. Putting all contributions together, one arrives
at the set of non-linear equations:

FIG. 2: Typical states starting from an asymmetric initial
condition a0 = 1/2, a1 = 1, a2 = 0 with N = 20 and ν =
0.2. Grey (white) rectangles represent nodes with opinion α
(β). The system ﬁrst reaches an asymmetric state where each
cluster has a diﬀerent global opinion. After some time, the
system escapes the asymmetric state and reaches a consensus
state where the whole system adopts one opinion. The time
for escaping the metastable state diverges when N → ∞,
i.e.
the system remains asymmetric. The consensus state
where all nodes reach opinion β has not been plotted to avoid
redundancy.

where ai and bi are respectively the proportion of nodes
with opinion α and β in the category i (bi = 1 − ai).

It is straightforward to show that a0 = a1 = a2 = 0
or a0 = a1 = a2 = 1 are always stationary solutions
of the above coupled equations. These symmetric states
correspond to systems where the whole population has
reached consensus for opinion α or β. However, com-
puter simulations (Fig.2) show that an asymmetric sta-
tionary state may prevail for small enough values of ν.
Contrary to the symmetric state that is frozen, ﬂuctu-
ations continue to take place in the asymmetric state.
These ﬂuctuations are shown to make the system escape
the asymmetric state for long enough times, i.e.
it is
metastable, while the absence of ﬂuctuations in the sym-
metric state forbids the return to the metastable state

at later times. Computer simulations also show that the
asymmetric state is characterized by averages of the form
a0 = 1
2 , i.e. interface nodes show no preference between
A or B, a1 = 1/2 + ǫ and a2 = 1/2 − ǫ, where ǫ ∈ [− 1
2 , 1
2 ].
Based on these numerical results, we look for solutions of
Eq.6 having this form. It is straightforward to show that
the second equation of Eq.6 is always satisﬁed, while the
equations for a1 and a2 lead to the following condition:

ǫ

(1 − ν)
6(2 − ν)2 (C + Dǫ2) = 0,

therefore not considered in the following.
In contrast,
when C > 0, the following stationary solutions are also
possible:

ǫ± = ±p−C/D

Solving C > 0 numerically, one ﬁnds that the asymmetric
stationary solution exists when ν < νC with νC = 0.471.
Values of ν for which solution Eq.9 is stable and prevails
in the long time limit is found by performing numeri-
cally [13] the stability analysis [14] of Eqs.6. It is found
that the critical value of ν at which one eigenvalue be-
comes positive is νS ∼ 0.355. Consequently, the system
exhibits a discontinuous transition at νS: when ν < νS,
the system may reach either the symmetric or the asym-
metric solution. When ν > νS, only the symmetric so-
lution is attained in the long time limit. We have per-
formed numerical simulations of the model (Fig.3) that
show an excellent agreement with the theoretical predic-
tion Eq.9. However, there is a small discrepancy of the
location of the transition: the transition appears to take
place around 0.32 in the simulations. This deviation is
due to due to ﬁnite size eﬀects, i.e.
the ﬁnite system
has escaped from the metastable solution. Let us also
stress that the above solution yields the expected value
ǫ± → ± 1

2 when ν → 0.

To conclude, we would like to point to the interesting
features of CFCN, that allow to model topologies with
well-deﬁned communities while preserving the validity of
mean ﬁeld methods and allowing to identify clearly the
role played by the core nodes vs. the interface nodes. Its
applicability to other models relying on social networks
could therefore be of interest. One may think of opinion
formation (e.g. Ising models [15, 16, 17], Voter models
[18, 19, 20, 21]), language dynamics (e.g. Naming game
[22, 23, 24])... This work could also provide a theoretical
background for the use of Ising-like models in order to
unravel structures in complex networks [25].

Abstract: A quantitative method is suggested, where meanings of words,
and grammatic rules about these, of a vocabulary are represented by real
numbers. People meet randomly, and average their vocabularies if they are
equal; otherwise they either copy from higher hierarchy or stay idle. Presence
of teachers broadcasting the same (but arbitrarily chosen) vocabulary leads
the language formations to converge more quickly.

Introduction: Within the emerging physics literature on languages [1-
12], birth of a language may be observed as a scarcely studied issue. In our
opinion, the subject is important for researches on language competition,
since quickly developed languages may have more chance to survive and
to spread.
In the present contribution, eﬀect of inequality on the speed
of originating a language is studied, where some social agents (hierarchical
people, teachers) play the role of nucleation centers for clustering of words,
meanings, and grammatic rules, etc. We present a quantitative model, where
each subentry of a vocabulary is represented by a real number, and so are the
words. Model is given in the following section; applications and results are
displayed in next one. Last section is devoted for discussion and conclusion.

Model: We have a society composed of N adults. Each person k has a
vocabulary of M words (wki, k ≤ N, i ≤ M). For a word there exist many re-
lated items as meanings, rules for plural forms, adverb forms, tenses, preﬁxes,
suﬃxes, etc. In real life, many words have a diversity of such peculiarities,
which are not all easy to learn and to remember; since their meanings may
be close to each other, as “dictionary” and “vocabulary”. Pronunciations
may be similar too; as “a head”, and “ahead”. Also; as, “night”, “knight”,
and “knife”. Such variations are symbolized by ﬁve diﬀerent subentries (j)
at most. So we take 1 ≤ j ≤ jmax for every word w and for each j we assign
a representative real number r. Therefore our words are sets of up to ﬁve
real numbers:

wki = {rkij}.

(1)

1

The maximum number jmax of subentries r is also determined randomly
between 1 and 5, independently for any word w. Clearly, rkij = 0 (wki =
{0, 0, 0, 0, 0}) corresponds to an unknown meaning (word) in the vocabulary
of the adult k.

Initially there is no consensus about a common vocabulary, but the con-
sensus may be set through several processes described in the following sub-
sections, and the values for initial rkij’s in Eq. (2) must be changed into time
dependent ones, i.e. rkij(t).

Evolution of the language spoken by any adult may be described by

Lk(t) =

rkij(t),

M

jmax

X
i=1

X
j=1

(2)

wherex, Lk varies from person to person, especially at the beginning of the
formation period, and this ﬂuctuation fades down with time since Lk → L,
if convergence occurs.

Eq. (2) may be summed over the members (k) of the society to consider

all the vocabularies present at time t:

X
k
As we observed, D(t) − D(t − 1) is a signiﬁcant quantity within the present
formalism, and we represent it by V (t):

D(t) =

Lk(t).

(3)

V (t) = D(t) − D(t − 1).

(4)

As t → ∞, D(t) is expected to converge to its limit D(t → ∞), and Lk(t)
to some L, and V (t) to zero. Then, the language L = Lk(t → ∞) may be
evaluated as established. Minor ﬂuctuations within D(t) about D(t → ∞),
and these within V (t) about zero may be attributed to misuses due to lack of
individual memories to remember all the relevant meanings, and rules, etc.
Initiation: We assign random real numbers for initial values of rkij, with

0 ≤ rkij < 1, where k ≤ N, i ≤ M, and j ≤ jmax(k, i).

Evolution: Once the initial vocabularies are set, we assume that two mem-

bers (k, and k’) meet randomly at a time t.

In the simplest case of no inequality in status (equality), they average

[13-14] subentries (rkij) in their vocabularies, and share the new ones:

rkij(t) = (rkij(t − 1) + rk’ij(t − 1))/2 = rk’ij(t),

(5)

N

2

and the language spoken by each adult (k) becomes:

Lk(t) = Lk′(t) = (Lk(t − 1) + Lk′(t − 1))/2.

(6)

As interaction tours (time t) advance, rkij(t → ∞) = 1/2 independent of
the subindices. We have D(t) = D(0) and V (t) = V (0) = 0, for all t, since
Lk(t) + Lk′(t) = Lk(t − 1) + Lk′(t − 1), due to Eq. (6).

We incorporate inequality into the society, by assigning some rank to
adults in terms of real numbers (greater than or equal to zero, and less than
one) determined randomly. Yet, any two adults will be considered as equiv-
alent if their ranks are close to each other by a given ∆, and each member
will average her vocabulary with the other, Eq. (5) and (6). Otherwise, the
one with lower rank (obeying) will copy down the vocabulary of the other
(commander) and take it as her new vocabulary, till another possible meet
with any adult occurs. In this case convergence (formation) of the language
may be speeded up under certain conditions, as studied within the following
section.

Furthermore, we may assume more stringent inequality: Some hierarchy
(all, with rank of unity) broadcast the same (yet arbitrarily selected) vocab-
ulary to the society, from the beginning on. We call them teachers. They
will not change their common vocabulary and due to their ultimate rank,
they will not average their vocabularies with anyone. Some other hierarchi-
cal people (within a given limit of ∆) may average their vocabularies after
they discuss with teachers. And the rest copies down from all those who have
higher ranks by ∆.

Applications and Results: In this section we will ﬁrst consider unique-
ness within society. Later, by assigning to each individual a random real num-
ber (rank; greater than or equal to zero, and less than one) we will establish
hierarchy. And ﬁnally, we will incorporate some teachers with ultimate rank
of unity into society.

We handled equality within adults by assuming an averaging process for
(1), (2), and (5)), and the meanings (rkij of Eq.
the words (wki of Eqs.
(1)) [13-14]. Evolution of rkij(t), for a randomly selected j is displayed in
Figure 1, where adults (N = 500) are all equal and only arbitrarily chosen
hundred adults are displayed. Each adult had her own initial randomly
selected meanings (rkij(0)) as used by herself and suggested to the society.
Whenever any two of the adults randomly meet, they obey Eq. (5); each
interacts equally with the other and averages her vocabulary. D(t) = D(0)

3

and V (t) = V (0) = 0, for all t, since D(t) of Eq. (3) does not change during
interactions Lk(t) + Lk′(t) = Lk(t − 1) + Lk′(t − 1), Eq. (6)). Corresponding
probability density function (PDF) for rkij(t) (with N = 500, M = 100 and
j ≤ jmax) is a delta function, i.e., PDF(V ) = δ(0) (inset, Fig. 1.).

We incorporate inequality into the society, by assigning some rank to
adults in terms of real numbers (greater than or equal to zero, and less
than one) determined randomly. Yet, any two adults will be considered as
equivalent if their ranks are close to each other by a given ∆. Under the
present condition, each member will average her vocabulary with the other,
Eq. (3). Otherwise, the one with lower rank will copy down the vocabulary
of the other and take it as her new vocabulary, till another possible meet
with any adult occurs.

For small ∆, almost everybody (except the top of hierarchy with rank
1 − ∆) may copy from others, and almost everybody (except the bottom of
hierarchy with rank ∆) may be copied by others. Within this content, the
averaging process between equals is ignored within the society (N). On the
other hand if 0.5 < ∆, only the top of hierarchy with rank 1 − ∆ will be
copied by the bottom of that with rank ∆, and more than half of the society
will average. Clearly, averaging process will dominate as 0.5 ≪ ∆ → 1.0;
therefore this regime implies more freedom and more discussion. ∆ = 1.0
case corresponds to equality of all the adults.

Evolutions of rkij(t) with various N, and M as designated in the ﬁgure
captions and j ≤ jmax, and D(t), and V (t) are displayed, in Figures 2a, and b,
and c, respectively, where ∆ = 0.2 for all. One may remark that, discussing
and averaging mechanism between (close) equals (by ∆), or copying from the
vocabulary of some higher rank people causes the language to converge, yet
convergence is very small for ∆ ∼ 0, and speeds up as ∆ → 1. For ∆ ∼ 0,
all the society speaks ultimately the language of the one with highest rank
which is very close to unity.

Teachers: Figure 3a displays evolution of rkij(t), with randomly selected
number of meanings (j ≤ jmax), where the meanings of words belong to
language of arbitrarily chosen hundred adults out of N = 5000 adults. Please
note the horizontal limiting line representing the language broadcasted by
teachers. The greater the distance from this line is, the greater is the needed
eﬀort to learn the language. Figure 3b displays D(t), and Figure 3c displays
V (t), with ∆ = 0.2 and τ = 0.2 in all, where τ designates the number of
teachers per population of the society (N). Please note the rapid convergence
in D(t) and V (t).

In Figure 3c there exist three behaviors in V (t): For t ∼ 0 region we
have comparably big ﬂuctuations; for t → ∞ we have very small ﬂuctua-
tions, both about zero. And in between we have exponential decay. Initial
ﬂuctuations originate from randomness, and the number of equilibrated ones
may be increased by increasing the number of tours (and also, precision of
real numbers in the utilized software). So, the characteristic regime is the
intermediate one and exponential decay implies that the envelope function
for D(t) (which passes through local maxima and minima) is also an expo-
nentially decaying one. (We had observed similar exponential decays within
our computations on opinion dynamics. [16]) The pronounced threefold be-
havior is reﬂected in PDF’s in Figure 3c; where, the horizontal axis is for V 2,
and the perpendicular one is logarithmic.

Small-speed regimes in PDF’s of Figure 3d correspond to t → ∞ region in
V (t), which may be ignored totally. Please note that PDF(V ) (and PDF(V 2))
goes to δ, as ∆ approaches unity and high speed wing tips in PDF’s are
coming from t ∼ 0 region in V (t), where randomness is dominant. Teachers
shape the intermediate region, and due to them we have the exponential
convergence in D(t). And one new language emerges, which is spoken by the
majority of adults, and will be learned by children.

Discussion and Conclusion: Clearly, increasing the number of teach-
ers (and τ ) increases rates of exponential decays in V (t) and D(t): There
will be more chance to check personal vocabularies, and number of ordinary
adults will be lowered. Big diﬀerences between the real numbers associated
to entries of the broadcasted common vocabulary and those to initial settings
may be considered as a kind of measure for diﬃculty to learn the relevant
language, since more interaction tours will be needed for averaging before
the personal vocabularies approach the broadcasted one. If the equilibrium
level of D(t) is far from the initial one, then the emerging language may be
considered as a tough one to learn. (We run the case, with 0.9 ≤ rkij < 1.0,
and 0.0 ≤ rkij < 0.1 (Eq. 3) for the teachers’ vocabulary many times and
veriﬁed the last remark in all.)

We run also the case, where each teacher broadcasted (keeping her ul-
timate rank) a diﬀerent vocabulary, rather than a common one. This case
corresponds to a richer language. And we obtained still, but rather slower,
exponential decays. In our opinion, this result agrees well with the reality
that those languages involving more words and grammatic rules are harder
to learn than those with less words and rules. In any case, presence of nuclei

5

speeds up clustering of words and rules; and the relevant language emerges
quickly. So, when a group of people immigrate to a new society, and if they
gain rank (power) they may broadcast their language to the present soci-
ety, which may be considered as one of the possible mechanism to spread
languages besides colonization, conquest, etc. As a ﬁnal remark it may be
stated that we varied the number of words (upper limit within the sum of
Eq. (2)) and the number of adults (N) within the society from 10, 100 to
1000, 5000, all respectively and obtained similar results. As the numbers
decreased, ﬂuctuations increased; yet, the envelope of D(t) always came out
as exponential.

Financial markets are highly correlated systems that reveal both the
inter-market dependencies and the correlations among their diﬀerent com-
ponents. Standard analyzing techniques include correlation coeﬃcients for
pairs of signals and correlation matrices for rich multivariate data. In the
latter case one constructs a real symmetric matrix with real non-negative
eigenvalues describing the correlation structure of the data. However, if one
performs a correlation-function-like analysis of multivariate data, when a
stress is put on investigation of delayed dependencies among diﬀerent types
of signals, one can calculate an asymmetric correlation matrix with complex
eigenspectrum. From the Random Matrix Theory point of view this kind
of matrices is closely related to Ginibre Orthogonal Ensemble (GinOE). We
present an example of practical application of such matrices in correlation
analyses of empirical data. By introducing the time lag, we are able to
identify temporal structure of the inter-market correlations. Our results
show that the American and German stock markets evolve almost simul-
taneously without a signiﬁcant time lag so that it is hard to ﬁnd imprints
of information transfer between these markets. There is only an extremely
subtle indication that the German market advances the American one by
a few seconds.

1. Introduction

A number of studies have shown that diﬀerent ﬁnancial markets reveal
hierarchical structure [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] that can be approximated by
factor and group models (e.g. [9, 10] for the stock market case). At the level
of ﬁnancial data, these structures are determined principally by strength of
correlations in returns of diﬀerent stocks, currencies or other assets. The
most popular methods of such an analysis are based on the calculation of
correlation matrices from multivariate time series of returns. The correla-
tion matrices can then be diagonalized in order to obtain spectra of their

(1)

eigenvalues and eigenvectors [11, 4, 12] or can serve as a source for the
construction of minimal spanning trees [1, 13, 8, 14]. In the standard ap-
proach, in which the correlations between all analysed assets are taken into
consideration, the correlation matrix is by construction symmetric due to
the correlation coeﬃcient invariance under a swap of signals. This obvi-
ously leads to a real eigenspectrum of the matrix. Usually properties of
the empirical correlation matrix are compared with universal predictions
of the adequate, Wishart ensemble of random matrices and the identiﬁed
deviations are considered as an indication of actual correlations among data.
In principle, however, there is no restriction imposed on the symmetry
property of a correlation matrix: it may well be antisymmetric or even com-
pletely asymmetric, depending on which signals are used in the calculations.
For example, if there are two separate sets of signals and the correlations
are calculated only across these two sets, the resulting matrix can no longer
be symmetric and, consequently, its eigenspectrum can be complex. How-
ever, there is still a non-zero probability that some of the eigenvalues and
eigenvectors are real. As long as a distribution of the correlation matrix
elements is close to a Gaussian, the most relevant random matrix ensem-
ble, against which the results should be tested, is the Ginibre Orthogonal
Ensemble (GinOE) [15]. For the ﬁnancial data characterized by fat tails
of p.d.f. this assumption can also be made provided the time series under
study are suﬃciently long.

At present one observes in literature a growing interest in theoretical re-
search on properties of real asymmetric and, more generally, non-Hermitean
random matrices. This interest is motivated by a broadening spectrum of
applications of such matrices which includes, among others, random net-
works [16], quantum chaos [17], quantum chromodynamics [18, 19] and
brain research [20]. An issue which we address in this work and which can
serve as an example of application of the asymmetric correlation matrices
to empirical data can be related to a globalization of ﬁnancial markets. We
investigate the cross-market correlations between returns of stocks traded
on two large but geographically distant markets: New York Stock Exchange
and Deutsche B¨orse. Our objective is to identify the strength of the instan-
teous as well as the time lagged dependencies between evolution of these
two markets.

2. Methods

We begin with presenting a brief construction scheme of an asymmetric
correlation matrix and a short description of basic properties of GinOE. Let
us consider the two disjoint sets X, Y each consisting of N assets and denote
by {x(s)
i }i=1,...,T the time series of normalized logarithmic

i }i=1,...,T and {y(t)

returns of assets s ∈ X and t ∈ Y (s, t = 1, ..., N ). For each set we construct
an N × T data matrix M and the correlation matrix CXY according to

which provides us with a complete spectrum of generally complex eigenval-
ues λk and pairs of conjugated eigenvectors vk. The assumption Y = X in
Eq.(1) leads to the standard deﬁnition of a symmetric correlation matrix
CXX with a real eigenspectrum.

Properties of the empirical correlation matrix have to be tested against
a null hypothesis of completely random correlations characteristic for inde-
pendent signals. Random Matrix Theory (RMT) oﬀers some analytic results
for a corresponding ensemble of real asymmetric matrices, i.e. the Ginibre

In physical situations with

3. Results

Our example of an application of the asymmetric correlation matrix is
based on high frequency data from NYSE and Deutsche B¨orse [24] spanning
the interval 1 Dec 1997 − 31 Dec 1999. We analyze N = 30 stocks belonging
to the Dow Jones Industrials group and the same number of stocks consti-
tuting the main German DAX30 index. We calculate each element of C by
cross-correlating the time series pairs representing all possible combinations
of an American and a German stock. We neither consider the correlations
inside the German market nor inside the American one. In order to inves-
tigate temporal dependencies between both markets we introduce a time
lag τ and associate it with the German stocks, i.e. we look at {x(s)
i }i=1,...,T
and {y(t)
i+τ }i=1,...,T , where τ can assume both positive and negative integer
values. Thus, τ > 0 denotes a retardation of all the signals corresponding
to German stocks while τ < 0 denotes the opposite case.

Since the two markets under study are separated by a few time zones,
their activities overlap only for a relatively short period of a trading day

(only the days that were common to both markets are considered). For most
time it was only 90 minutes a day from 9:30 to 11:00 New York time (15:30
to 17:00 Frankfurt time) and only after changing the trading hours in the
German ﬂoor starting from 20 Sep 1999 the overlap interval increased to 120
minutes (from 9:30 to 11:30 in New York and 15:30 to 17:30 in Frankfurt).
This means that actually we can analyze the time series spanning 47700
minutes total. A good time resolution should be a crucial aspect of our
analysis hence we consider only short time scales of returns: from ∆t = 120
seconds down to ∆t = 3 seconds. Shorter time scales cannot be used due

to a fact that transaction times in the TAQ database are stored with only
1 s resolution.

First of all let us look at the correlation matrix and its eigenvalues for τ =
0 (no time lag, synchronous evolution of both markets). Figure 2(a) presents
p.d.f. of the matrix elements Cs,t for ∆t = 3 s (histogram) together with
a ﬁtted Gaussian distribution (red solid line). Except the central part of
the empirical distribution, where there are excessive small positive elements
and lacking small negative ones, the Gaussian is well approximated by the
histogram (the same refers to the other time scales). Thus, the correlation
matrix can be treated [25] as a sum of an essentially random core matrix
and a non-random part carrying the actual inter-market correlations. This
suggests that we can expect the eigenvalue spectrum consisting of an RMT
bulk and at least one signiﬁcant non-random eigenvalue responsible for the
correlations. In fact, exactly this type of spectrum can be seen in Figure
2(b). All except one eigenvalues are localized inside the RMT prediction for
a completely asymmetric matrix and the remaining largest one is distant

and resides on the real axis. By an analogy to a symmetric matrix we are
justiﬁed to associate this eigenvalue with the coupling strength of the two
markets (the global market factor). Interestingly, there is no other factor
which can inﬂuence the behaviour of some smaller parts of the markets like
e.g. speciﬁc economic sectors.

Figure 3 shows examples of the eigenspectra for two diﬀerent positive
time lags. As we increase τ from 0 s up to 5 min, we observe a gradual
decrease of |λ1| which remains real even for τ > 120 s, but eventually looses
its identity by drowning in the sea of random eigenvalues for ∆t = 5 min.
From the market perspective, after such a time interval the stocks traded in
Frankfurt forget about what happened earlier in New York. We however still
cannot say anything decisive about the possible directional information ﬂow
between the markets. It requires a more systematic investigation in which
the largest eigenvalue λ1 (i.e. the one with the largest absolute magnitude)
becomes a function of variable τ . Figure 4 displays λ1(τ ) for diﬀerent time
scales of the returns. It can be seen that with the resolutions of ∆t = 120
and 60 s the maximum coupling between the markets occurs for synchronous
signals and the non-random correlations exist for −3 ≤ τ ≤ 3 minutes. For
∆t = 30 s a weak trace of asymmetry in both the maximum position and
the memory length can be identiﬁed, which is conﬁrmed in the plot for
∆t = 15 s. Going down to the shortest time scale of 3 s, this asymmetry
becomes clear. Figure 5 documents that the stocks from both markets are

8

maximally correlated if the American market is retarded by about 3-15
seconds in respect to its German counterpart. This observation is somehow
counterintuitive because one might expect that the American stock market,
being the largest in the world and representing the world’s largest economy,
is less dependent on external inﬂuence than is the German market. We
cannot give a straightforward explanation of this phenomenon, though. Its
source can lie in memory properties of the American market as well as in
some speciﬁc behaviour of investors in the beginning of a trading day in
New York. For example, they may carefully observe the evolution of the
European markets which in the years 1998-99 used to ﬁnish their activity
rather soon after the American markets had been opened. We also cannot
exclude the possibility that the reason for this is a possible existence of
artifacts in the trade recordings in TAQ or KKMDB databases which cannot
be identiﬁed in data. Finally, the observed asymmetry of the curve tails in
Figures 4 and 5 with respect to τ = 0 can be explained, at least in part, by
diﬀerent autocorrelation properties of the two markets under study. This is
evident in Figure 6, where the largest eigenvalue of the symmetric matrix
CXX is calculated separately for the German and for the American markets.
Here τ assumes only non-negative values due to a symmetry of the problem;
λ1(τ ) is a multivariate counterpart of the autocorrelation function.
It is
clear from Figure 6 that the German market has considerably longer and
stronger memory than its American counterpart; in fact, this memory can
lead to longer-lasting cross-dependencies presented in Figures 4 and 5 if
the German market is retarded. On the other hand, investors in Frankfurt
may need a longer time to collect all the information needed before they
make investment decisions if they take more markets and more information
into consideration.
It is also possible that the American stock market is
technically more advanced and, on average, allows the investors to react
quicker than in Germany.

4. Conclusions

We construct an asymmetric real correlation matrix from time series of
returns representing two separate groups of stocks: German and American
ones. Nonexistence of a symmetry condition allows us to concentrate solely
on the inter-market correlations without mixing them with the correlations
that are inner to only one market, and to study temporal properties of such
correlations. We introduce a time lag associated with German stocks and
investigate traces of direct information transfer from one market to the other
which can manifest itself in the existence of signiﬁcant non-synchronous
couplings between the markets represented by a τ -shifted maximum in the
largest eigenvalue of the empirical correlation matrix. We identiﬁed such

delayed correlations indicating that the same information is shared by both
markets with the American one following its German counterpart only after
a few seconds. This observation, however, cannot be treated as a fully
convincing one due to a signiﬁcant broadening of the λ1(τ ) maximum and
an unintuitive direction of this transfer from a smaller towards a larger
market. Another conclusion from our results is that the coupling between
the two analyzed markets is only of a one-factor type. We do not noticed
other, more subtle partial couplings that can involve a subset of stocks.

Our results can be compared with the results of ref. [26] in which an
analysis of the delayed correlations between diﬀerent stocks traded on the
American market are studied by means of the correlation coeﬃcients. It is
worth mentioning that a similar analysis can also be performed by applying
the asymmetric correlation matrices used in our work.

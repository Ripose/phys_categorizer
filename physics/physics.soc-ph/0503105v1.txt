Random trading market: Drawbaks and

a realisti modi(cid:28)ation

We point out some ma jor drawbaks in random trading market models and

propose a realisti modi(cid:28)ation whih overomes suh drawbaks through

`sensible trading'. We apply suh trading poliy in di(cid:27)erent situations: a)

Agents with zero saving fator b) with onstant saving fator and ) with

random saving fator (cid:21)in all the ases the riher agents seem to follow power

laws in terms of their wealth (money) distribution whih support Pareto's

observation.

Introdution

Pareto power law [1℄ in wealth distribution has beome a hot topi nowadays. Sine last

deade physiists are putting a lot of e(cid:27)orts to study eonomi market through suitable

models [2, 3, 4, 5℄. They onsider eonomi market as a multi-agent interating system

and try to analyze the market through known tools of statistial physis although in

reality the eonomi market is muh more omplex and the agents are inherently di(cid:27)erent

from eah other(cid:21)so annot be hoped to behave similarly. To start with, a losed eonomy

market has been onsidered having some money exhange interation (cid:21)the main intention

is to (cid:28)nd out the distribution of wealth (money) among the agents and to searh for a

suitable exhange interation whih an produe Pareto like power law distribution of

wealth.

Random trading market

The moleules in an ideal gas interat freely(cid:21) and the kineti theory (cid:28)nds the energy

distribution among the moleules. If the agents of model market exhange their money

through suh free interations (cid:21)that market is alled a random trading market [2℄. Two

types of basi random trading are possible:

1

Type-I trading

Two interating agents (i and j ) put all their money (mi and mj ) together. Then one

agent takes a random part of the total money and rest money goes to other agent.

total = mi + mj = m′

i + m′

j

m′

i = ǫ × total; m′

j = total − m′

i

with 0 ≤ ǫ ≤ 1

Here agents do not save anything and put all their money for trading. This type of

trading rule results [2℄ Gibbs distribution of the money distribution in the market at

steady state having the form:

P (m) ∼ e−m/T

where T is the average money (total money/total agent) of the market. Clearly this

distribution is similar to the energy distribution within the moleules of ideal gas. If the

agents do save some portions ((cid:28)xed or random) of their money then the total money

available for random trading gets redued. We an write the general money exhange

rule for two agents having money mi and mj and saving fators si and sj respetively:

total = mi + mj

(tot)av = mi(1 − si) + mj(1 − sj)

m′

i = (mi × si) + ǫ × (tot)av ; m′

j = total − m′

i

For (cid:28)xed saving fator (si = sj = s) we get a most probable type money distribution
[2, 4℄ and for random saving fator (0 ≤ si ≤ 1) the money distribution shows [5℄ Pareto
power law with exponent −2.

Type-II trading

Another type of trading may our [3℄ when two interating agents put same amount of

money for random exhange i.e, the riher agent put an amount just equal to that of the

poor agent. Then as before one agent takes a random part of the total money (available

for trading) and rest money goes to other agent.

total = mi + mj = m′

i + m′

j

If mi < mj

(tot)av = 2 × mi

2

We an generalize the above sheme for two agents (i and j ) with saving fators si and

If mi ≥ mj

sj as

If mi < mj

If mi ≥ mj

m′

i = ǫ × (tot)av ; m′

j = total − m′

i

(tot)av = 2 × mj

m′

j = ǫ × (tot)av ; m′

i = total − m′

j

total = mi + mj ;

(tot)av = 2 × mi(1 − si)

m′

i = (mi × si) + ǫ × (tot)av ; m′

j = total − m′

i

(tot)av = 2 × mj(1 − sj)

m′

j = (mj × sj) + ǫ × (tot)av ; m′

i = total − m′

j

Major drawbaks

In Type-I trading

1) The random exhange in Type-I trading market reates `inseurity ' problem. Here

riher agents put more money (beyond saving) to trade with poor agents (cid:21)even with

agents having no money. Therefore the riher agent always (cid:28)nds greater probability to

loose than to gain from an exhange interation. It may happen that the riher agent

looses all his money in one interation. Thus Type-I trading favors the poor agents and

it is really a nightmare to the riher agents.

2) Type-I trading shows Pareto power law when the agents have random saving fator

drawn from an interval 0 ≤ si ≤ 1. But there is one important restrition that the
interval has to inludes the value 1 (or very nearly 1). If we take an interval 0 ≤ si ≤ 0.8

-there will not be any robust power law (cid:21)that means some agents with very high saving

fator have to be present in the market who always gain money from the interations

and do not loose. Therefore to ahieve Pareto power law this model pre-assigned some

agents as permanent gainer (cid:21)whih weakens the model itself.

3

In Type-II trading

Although Type-II trading seems realisti, it has a basi problem that it gradually tends

toward `monopoly ' market where all money goes to a single agent making all others

simply beggar. This happens beause when one agent losses all his money he annot take

part in further money exhange as he does not a(cid:27)ord some money for trade. Thus the

agents having `zero' money remain `outast' from the soiety and their number inreases

as the interations go on.

The `sensible trading' sheme

We propose a `sensible trading' sheme among the agents to avoid the aforesaid draw-

baks. This is a mixture of Type-I and Type-II trading: Interations follow Type-II

trading with a probability p and obey Type-I trading with probability (1 − p). Thus the

general money exhange sheme for this `sensible' trading appears as:

For r ≤ p

For r > p

If mi < mj

If mi ≥ mj

total = mi + mj = m′

i + m′

j

(tot)av = mi(1 − si) + mj(1 − sj)

m′

i = (mi × si) + ǫ × (tot)av ; m′

j = total − m′

i

(tot)av = 2 × mi(1 − si)

m′

i = (mi × si) + ǫ × (tot)av ; m′

j = total − m′

i

(tot)av = 2 × mj(1 − sj)

m′

j = (mj × sj) + ǫ × (tot)av ; m′

i = total − m′

j

Here r is a random number uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. Clearly when
p = 0 only Type-I trading is possible and when p = 1 we will have Type-II trading only.

Therefore we an reprodue Type-I and Type-II tradings orretly from this generalized

`sensible trading' sheme. The behavior of this sheme beomes interesting when p value

lies in between the above extremes (cid:21)so that both (cid:21)Type-I and Type-II tradings play their

role. We all it a `sensible market' where Type-II trading dominates muh over Type-I

trading beause Type-II has no extra risk. We observe that for p > 0.9 -the market
seems to approah toward `monopoly trend' and for p ≤ 0.5 Type-I trading dominates
resulting Gibbs-like free-market. Therefore we keep p values in the range 0.5 < p ≤ 0.9

to have a `sensible market'.

4

Let us disuss how does this sheme overome the drawbaks:

1) Here the riher agents feel seured as in most of the ases they apt Type-II trading

with poor agents and there is no risk to loose more.

2) If some agents loose all their money (cid:21)still they an interat with others through

Type-I trading (with 1 − p probability) and an gain money to beome riher. This

resists the `monopoly ' trend and drives the system toward a steady state.

Now we are going to (cid:28)nd (numerially) the money distributions following `sensible

trading' sheme in di(cid:27)erent situations. We hoose two p values: p = 0.8 and p = 0.9
to make the market more sensitive. Also we hoose number of agents N = 100 and the
average money T = 100 and number of interations = 5000000 in eah ase.

Without any saving fator the `sensible' market shows two power laws and demands

that the poor agents and the riher agents obey di(cid:27)erent power law behavior. The

deviation of the distribution funtion from the free market (Gibbs law) is prominent.

In Gibbs like free market onstant saving fator results most probable type distribution.

But in the sensible market we observe that for low saving fator the distributions almost

follow exponential laws and this exponential behavior deviates (some power laws appear)

as we inrease p values. On the other hand for high saving fator the most probable type

distributions appear.

Conlusions

A free market (Type-I trading) basially runs through `gambling' and a restrited market

(Type-II trading) gradually beomes a `monopoly ' market. But a areful mixing of Type-I

and Type-II trading an produe a muh realisti model of losed market. Suh a market

shows power law behavior in terms of wealth (money) distribution within agents for

di(cid:27)erent situations of money exhange (cid:21)therefore potentially advaned.

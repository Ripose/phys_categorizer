Abstract. - We present a simple one-parameter model for spatially localised evolving agents
competing for spatially localised resources. The model considers selling agents able to evolve
their pricing strategy in competition for a ﬁxed market. Despite its simplicity, the model displays
extraordinarily rich behavior. In addition to “cheap” sellers pricing to cover their costs, “expen-
sive” sellers spontaneously appear to exploit short-term favorable situations. These expensive
sellers “speciate” into discrete price bands. As well as variety in pricing strategy, the “cheap”
sellers evolve a strongly correlated spatial structure, which in turn creates niches for their expen-
sive competitors. Thus an entire ecosystem of coexisting, discrete, symmetry-breaking strategies
arises.

Many economic models of marketplace interactions have
been formulated (e.g., [1–3]). Generally, these systems
assume complete information, and no transaction costs.
That is, for interacting buyers and sellers, buyers may al-
ways search the entire space of sellers (possibly with some
search cost) in order to ﬁnd the best deal.

When competition is between sellers, such games gener-
ally have a stable, zero-proﬁt (Nash) equilibrium, possibly
with multiple prices [1, 3]. Despite a substantial literature
on spatial extensions to classic game theoretic models such
as the Prisoner’s Dilemma [4–7], few models exist for sim-
ple marketplaces in which buyers cannot access the en-
tire seller space (some exist for real-world situations, see,
e.g., [8]). Again in the context of the Prisoner’s Dilemma,
much progress has been made by considering players which
are only adaptive by random mutation with selection [9,10]
as in ecological models [11, 12]. However, this has been
only infrequently applied to marketplace games, one model
is described in [13].

In this paper we present a simple spatial model, similar
in spirit to the Minority Game [14, 15], with limited in-
teraction distances and random mutations with selection.
The model is formulated in terms of active, evolving sell-
ers competing for passive buyers. A dual ecological model

involves diﬀerent species competing for a scarce resource.
We attempt to make the simplest possible model for
a spatially distributed market with localised information
and evolving price strategy. We consider a system of
2N interacting agents: agents are split into one of two
types, there are N selling agents (sellers) and N buying
agents (buyers). Agents are placed on a 1-dimensional
chain where each site contains a seller, and each link a
buyer. Buyers are connected to their nearest neighbours,
i.e., they have knowledge of 2 sellers. Each seller has cap-
ital Ci and an unvarying price Pi. Initial prices are drawn
from Pi ∈ [1, Pmax].

Each iteration proceeds as follows:

1. All sellers’ capital is reduced by 2, the cost of produc-

ing enough stock for both possible buyers.

2. Each buyer visits the cheapest connected seller.

3. For each buyer visiting seller i, Ci increases by Pi.

4. All sellers with Ci < 0 are bankrupt: site i becomes

vacant.

5. Vacant sites are repopulated with probability γ.

7. New sellers at site i take the price of an existing
seller at randomly chosen site j, Pi = Pj + dp (dp ∈
[max (−∆, 1 − Pj), ∆]).

Note that buyers are always present, but unlike in the
other games mentioned above, sellers’ sites might not par-
ticipate in all rounds of the game (if γ 6= 1). This allows for
local variation in the spatial structure and the availability
of supply. Sellers are assumed to know their overhead cost
(2), and will not charge below this. Stock is assumed to be
perishable and thus, any unsold stock is destroyed 1. The
new sellers may be regarded either as independent sellers
adopting their strategy from successful rivals, or franchises
of those rivals.

There are three parameters in the model, Pmax, ∆, and
γ. Pmax is simply a boundary on the initial conditions; as
we shall see, for reasonable values, the mutation step ∆
aﬀects only the timescale of reaching equilibrium: γ is the
only parameter which governs system behavior.

We will show that this model produces very complex be-
havior, with a range of discrete but non-symmetric strate-
gies emerging. Before doing so, we discuss what would be
expected from a mean ﬁeld approach.

The classic analysis for this type of demand limited com-
petition [16] suggests that prices will be driven down to
the “Bertrand equilibrium”, a level that recoups the pro-
duction cost, here P0 = 1. With the current model, there
is insuﬃcient demand to support all sellers at this price,
thus there will be dead sites whose number may be esti-
mated.

Initially, consider the case where the system is already
in the Bertrand equilibrium: let the price of each seller be
chosen randomly from a uniform distribution P ∈ [1, 1+δ],
with small variation: δ ∼ ∆ ≪ 1. In order to survive a
round, each seller must sell all its stock.

Consider a live seller, at the beginning of a round it will

be in one of three situations:

1. Both neighbouring sellers are dead.

2. One neighbouring seller is dead, while the other is

alive.

3. Both neighbouring sellers are alive.

Let α be the proportion of live sellers at the beginning of
the round, then we can write the probability of each of the
three cases as: p1 = (1 − α)2, p2 = 2α(1 − α), and p3 = α2.
In order to survive, the seller must either be in situation
(1), or in situation (2) or (3) and outcompeting the live
sellers. This gives a survival probability (given the uniform
price distribution) of ps = p1 + p2
3 −
α + 1. The proportion surviving is hence f (α) = α(α2/3 −
α + 1). Thus, with γ = 1
2 , at the beginning of the next
round, the proportion of live sites is 1
2 (1 + f (α)); in the
steady state, this must be equal to α. Solving numerically

prices P < 2, the band then migrates downward and broadens

features of the graph are size independent and reproducible (as
shown), and sharpen with reduced ∆.

gives the proportion of live sites in the steady state as
αss ≈ 0.66.

Unfortuately, the mean ﬁeld assumption is invalid. Sim-
ulated results, with initial prices seeded close to the
Bertrand equilibrium, show that in the steady state α =
0.71 ± 0.01, which does not agree with the prediction for
αss. Closer examination of the structure of the steady
state in simulation shows that there is a high degree of
correlation in placement of sellers. If the steady-state were
a mean ﬁeld, we would expect p(n) ≈ αss ∀n. As can be
seen in ﬁg. 2, this is evidently not the case. An ordered
array of “supercheap” sellers on alternate sites forms with
prices very close to P0: Pi − P0 ≪ ∆. The presence of
such an array is stable against intrusion in the interme-
diate sites, as a putative new seller opening there must
be cheaper than both neighbours, and both their eventual
replacements to survive.

The fully correlated case, where every other seller is su-
percheap, has αss = 0.75, while the uncorrelated case has
αss ≈ 0.66. In between the two extremes is the actual sit-
uation. With random initial conditions, many correlated
regions develop at the same time.
In order for them to
match at their boundaries, they must nucleate in phase,
otherwise they form an antiphase boundary which can-
not be removed by the addition or removal of a single
supercheap seller (ﬁg. 2). Thus the Bertrand “equilib-
rium” is locally stable to small perturbations, although
some spatial structure is already visible (ﬁg. 2).

in total.

prices shows that the global steady-state is a good deal
more complex: a range of high-price sellers coexist with
the cheap ones: ﬁg. 1. These sellers exploit temporary
monopoly situations where adjacent sites are dead.

This extraordinary behavior is at variance with a con-
ventional demand-limited picture, and can be likened to
biological speciation. Several distinct seller types emerge,
which cannot mutate into one another. The expensive
sellers need not have an inﬁnite lifetime: because of the
replicator dynamics it suﬃces that each should be repli-
cated once in its average lifetime.

Due to the highly correlated environment which expen-
sive sellers occupy, a mean ﬁeld analysis is insuﬃcient. In-
stead, consider the ﬁrst band (P = 2) of expensive sellers
in 1D: these survive if they sell to, on average, one buyer
per turn. The possible changes in the capital C of such an
expensive seller, assuming its neighbours are cheap, are:

1. ∆C = P − 1 if both neighbouring sellers are dead,

2. ∆C = P/2 − 1 if one neighbour is dead and the other

is alive,

3. ∆C = −1 if both neighbours are alive.

C therefore carries out a random walk halting when the
capital becomes negative. The na¨ıve guess is that this
walk is biased in favor of the negative step; one might
expect that p1 = (1 − α)2, p2 = 2α(1 − α), and p3 = α2
with α ≈ 0.68. However, simulation tells us that the mean
lifetime of expensive sellers scales with the lifetime of the
game, our na¨ıve guess must therefore be incorrect.

phase, i.e., their second neighbours are supercheap.
In
the limiting case, this means that their ﬁrst neighbour
competitors are dead 50% of the time. This changes the
step direction bias in the random walk described above
since the probabilities primarily depend on γ rather than
α: the mean lifetime of such a walk with γ ≤ 1
2 is inﬁnite.
These niches would appear to allow arbitrarily high
prices, and any seller charging ≥ 2 to survive. However,
one can apply the ideas of Bertrand competition to the
expensive sellers: on a long enough timescale they will set
up adjacent to one another, and capital will be transferred
to the cheaper seller.

The discrete trading rounds mean that integer prices
will have better short term survival prospects: e.g., a sale
to one buyer at 4 in the ﬁrst trading period will ensure
survival for two rounds, while 3.9 will only survive one. In
this scenario with two potential buyers, the advantage for
odd integer price is less: e.g., a price of 3 has to sell twice
to survive an extra round compared with 2. If one starts
with a homogenous distribution of initial prices, this leads
to “speciation”: symmetry breaking in the preferred price
band favouring marginally above integer value, ﬁg. 1. Re-
markably, once the speciation has occured, the character
of the competition changes again. “Intraspecies” competi-
tion between sellers in the same price band becomes crit-
ical, and prices below the integer values become viable,
until a balance is reached between intra- and inter-species
competition.

Although this analysis requires that trading rounds be
discrete, the main features (heavily favored prices) are
still present if trading happens in a stochastic manner.
For stochastic dynamics, a buyer is chosen at random to
go shopping, and a seller is chosen at random to pay an
overhead, this is repeated such that the expected num-
ber of times a buyer goes shopping is one, this completes
one trading round. The bankruptcy and rebirth dynam-
ics procede as before. Since buyers may now visit a seller
more than once, there is no upper bound on the amount
of stock a seller may sell, we therefore set the quantity of
stock to ∞, and thus the marginal cost to zero. Despite
this, prices at integer multiples of P = 1 are still favored
(ﬁg. 3).

We may remove a further restriction on the original
model by not requiring that sellers charge above the
marginal cost. In this case, favored prices still exist, and
do so for a range of connectivities:
for a seller with d
potential buyers (paying an overhead d), prices of P =
dn/m, n, m ∈ Z+ are favored (ﬁg. 3 inset), corresponding
to attracting m/n buyers on average per round.

We now consider whether such expensive sellers are in
some sense beneﬁcial. Due to the existence of dead sites
and the limited interaction distance, demand is not com-
pletely satisﬁed. The introduction of a wider range of
prices results in both a larger total population and more
demand being satisﬁed.

It turns out that the long-lived expensive sellers occupy
favorable niches: the “supercheap” sites of the correlated

The dependence of the lifetimes of the expensive sellers
on γ tells us that this parameter may be used to char-

Equally, γ = 0 leads to an essentially random distribution

these two extremes, we expect some kind of transition

if γ < 1

By monitoring ﬂuctuations in a simulation we can see
that the system undergoes a transition at a critical value
of γ ≈ 1
2 in which the variance in the number of live sellers
diverges (ﬁg. 4).

We see further evidence of a transition when consid-
ering the mean unsatisﬁed demand, being approximately
constant for γ < 1
2 (ﬁg. 5). If
there were no transition, we would expect the demand to
be quadratic in γ for all values: this is indeed the case if we
force the system into a Bertrand steady state by specifying
initial conditions accordingly.

the initial conditions only sample the Bertrand regime
(P ≈ 1), then it remains in such a steady state indeﬁ-
nitely. Equally, if the initial conditions sample the whole
price spectrum, then the ﬁnal steady state contains mul-
tiple price bands. In order for the system to escape from
the Bertrand state, it requires a nucleation of expensive
sellers which cannot happen through mutations in prices
(due to adverse selective pressures on intermediate prices).
Equally, for small system sizes, ﬂuctuations may eliminate
high price bands which cannot be repopulated.

According to Nash [17], it is possible for multiple strate-

gies to coexist provided that no individual can do any bet-
ter by changing their strategy. In our system, changes in
price at a site are discontinuous, as are changes in the
competing strategies of the neighbours (each changes only
when the shop’s capital goes to zero). These discrete, lo-
calised changes prevent the system ﬁnding a perfect Nash
equilibrium. To apply the notion of a Nash equilibrium
one has to assume that the evolution of prices is equivalent
to the sites behaving as rational agents: it is possible that
this is the case only in the inﬁnite time limit, not reached
by our simulations. Another hypothesis about evolving,
replicating systems is that the system as a whole organises
to maximise the number of replicators (here, sellers) [18].
In ﬁg. 5 we see good evidence for this: the expensive sell-
ers become viable when they are able to increase the total
number of living sellers above the Bertrand solution. A
side eﬀect of this is to minimise the unsatisﬁed demand.

We have shown that the obvious generalization of a
classic Bertrand-Edgeworth game has some surprising re-
sults. The classical Bertrand equilibrium is not necessarily
reached, as the system is able to self-organise to produce
niches where diﬀerent strategies can ﬂourish. Further, we
have shown that random mutation and selection can (in
the case of restricted initial conditions) produce the ex-
pected Nash result. That is, sellers need not be active in
selecting strategies, the selective force against badly per-
forming members is enough to bring the system to equi-
librium.

The spontaneous production of evolutionary niches in
an initially homogeneous space has strong parallels in evo-
lutionary ecology. We can envisage a similar situation
where the “sellers” become individuals foraging for food.
The “cheap sellers” represent foragers which are eﬃcient
at ﬁnding the food, but have a high metabolic rate and
need to feed often. The “expensive sellers” are less eﬃ-
cient at foraging, but can survive for longer on the same

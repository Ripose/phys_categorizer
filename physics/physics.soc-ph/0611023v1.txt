Using a data set which includes all transactions among banks in the Italian
money market, we study their trading strategies and the dependence among them.
We use the Fourier method to compute the variance-covariance matrix of trading
strategies. Our results indicate that well deﬁned patterns arise. Two main commu-
nities of banks, which can be coarsely identiﬁed as small and large banks, emerge.

1 Introduction

Credit institutions in the Euro area are required to hold minimum reserve balances
within National Central Banks. Reserves provide a buﬀer against unexpected liquidity
shocks, mitigating the related ﬂuctuations of market interest rates. These reserves are
remunerated at the main reﬁnancing rate. In the period under investigation, they had to
be fulﬁlled only on average over a one-month maintenance period that runs from the 24th
of a month to the 23rd of the following month, the end of maintenance day (henceforth
EOM). Banks can exchange reserves on the interbank market with the objective to
minimize the reserve implicit costs.
In Italy, exchanges are regulated in the e-MID
market.

The objective of this paper is to analyze correlations in the liquidity management strate-
gies among banks in Italy, using an unique data set of transactions with overnight ma-
turity. The information includes transaction prices, volumes and the encoded identity
of quoting and ordering banks. Thus we are able to disentangle the trading strategy
of each bank. There are indications that not all credit institutions actively manage
their minimum reserves. Some institutions, typically smaller, tend to keep their reserve
account at the required level constantly through the maintenance period.

We adopt recently developed statistical techniques to reliably measure correlations be-
tween trading strategies, as proxied by the cumulative trading volume. The time series
are highly asynchronous, but the adopted methodology, namely the Fourier method, is
suitable to deal with this situation. We estimate the variance-covariance matrix, and
we analyze it using two techniques: standard principal component analysis and network
analysis, with the latter providing information on the presence of communities.

We show that the spectrum of the variance-covariance matrix displays only few eigenvec-
tors which are not in agreement with the random matrix prediction. In particular we ﬁnd
that the largest eigenvalue, which reﬂects the total aggregation level of the strategies,
decreases as we approach the EOM date. The network analysis reveals the existence of
two main communities.

2 Estimation of variance-covariance matrix

To analyze the presence of common factors in trading strategies among diﬀerent banks
we estimate the variance-covariance matrix of signed trading volumes.

The Italian electronic broker market MID (Market for Interbank Deposits) covers the
whole existing domestic overnight deposit market in Italy. This market is unique in
the Euro area in being a screen based fully electronic interbank market. Outside Italy
interbank trades are largely bilateral or undertaken via voice brokers. Both Italian banks
and foreign banks can exchange funds in this market. The participating banks were 215
in 1999, 196 in 2000, 183 in 2001 and 177 in 2002. Banks names are visible next to their
quotes to facilitate credit line checking. Quotes can be submitted and a transaction is
ﬁnalized if the ordering bank accepts a listed bid/oﬀer. Each quote is identiﬁed as an

oﬀer or a bid. An oﬀer indicates that the transaction has been concluded at the selling
price of the quoting bank while a bid indicates that a transaction has been concluded
at the buying price of the quoting bank.

Our data set consists of all the overnight transactions concluded on the e-MIB from
January 1999 to December 2002 for a total of 586,007 transactions. For each contract
we have information about the date and time of the trade, the quantity, the interest rate
and the encoded name of the quoting and ordering bank.

Our sample consists of Nb = 265 banks, and our data span four trading years. In the
analysis, our main results refer to a sub-sample of 85 banks who trade at least 900 days
(from the ﬁrst transaction to the last), and with a number of transactions larger than
1000. For comparison, in some cases, we also present the results of the analysis for the
all sample (in this last case the results are statistically less accurate).

Trading is highly asynchronous. While some banks trade as frequently as every few
minutes others can be inactive for several days.

In ﬁgure 1 we plot the cumulative distribution of average volumes (left) and average
waiting times (right) across banks. The distribution of average waiting times is power
law, revealing that there is not a typical scale for the trading frequency in the system.

In ﬁgure 2 we plot the distribution of waiting times, over the four year periods, for two
highly active banks. We ﬁnd that the distribution follows a stretched exponential of the
form a exp(−t/τ )β [1]. The parameters of the ﬁt for the two banks are reported in table
1.

We denote the signed trading volume as the cumulative volume of transactions for a
single bank, where every transaction is added with a plus sign if the transaction is a sell,
and with a minus sign if the transaction is a buy. As an example, if a bank starts with
a given liquidity, lends some money and then borrows it to restore the initial liquidity,
the total signed trading volume will be positive and increasing in the beginning, then
decreasing to zero thereafter.

exponential ﬁt. The parameters of the ﬁt are reported in table 1.

Hence we compute the signed trading volume ¯V i
t , where the superscript i denotes the
bank, and we analyze their correlation matrix. Figure 3 shows the signed trading volume
time series for a number of banks. It is apparent that there are some banks that follow
correlated strategies and others that follow anticorrelated strategies. A structural break
clearly appears in July 2001, when some banks inverted their trading behavior. This
change of behavior can be associated with two events, at least. First, the oﬃcial and
market interest rates of the Euro area changed their trend from positive to negative at
the beginning of 2001. Money market rates started increasingly to price in a reduction
in the ECB interest rates of 25 basis points that was eventually decided on 30 August
2001. Furthermore the amount of liquidity provided by the European Central Bank
increased in the summer 2001 to support economic growth.

There are many issues in computing the variance-covariance matrix. First, we do not
observe changes of signed volume in continuous time, but only in form of discrete changes
which occur when a transaction between two banks takes place. Second, the transac-
tions do not occur at the same time. Thus, given two banks, the changes in signed
volume are not synchronous. Furthermore some banks can trade more often than oth-
ers and we observe a wide spectrum of trading frequencies. These diﬃculties make the
implementation of a classical Pearson-like variance-covariance estimator problematic.

To circumvent these diﬃculties, we adopt the Fourier estimator of [2] instead. This is
based on the following idea. Take a number of trajectories Xi observed in [0, 2π], and
compute the Fourier coeﬃcients ak(dXi), bk(dXi) of dXi. Then, the covariance between
Xi and Xj is estimated via:

Cov(Xi, Xj) ≃ 1
M

M

X
k=1

[ak(dXi)ak(dXj) + bk(dXi)bk(dXj)]

(1)

where M is the largest frequency employed in computation which has to be suitably
selected. The actual covariance is estimated in the limit M → ∞. The methodology
is model-free, and it produces very accurate, smooth estimates. Most importantly, it
handles the time series in their original form without any need of imputation or data
discarding. The estimator is based on integration of the time series to compute the
Fourier coeﬃcients, thus it is well suited to the uneven structure of the data. Moreover,
it has a natural interpretation in the frequency domain, which is exactly what we aim to
take care of, given banks’ diﬀerent trading frequencies. This estimator has been shown
to perform much better than the Pearson estimator in this kind of situations [3],[4]. It
also performs well in estimating univariate volatility in the presence of microstructure
noise[5]. Typically, it has been used for ﬁnancial markets asset prices, e.g. on foreign
exchange rates [6][7], stock prices [8] and stock index futures prices [9,10,11]. In this
paper, we use it to analyze the cross-correlation among cumulative volumes. We refer
to the quoted papers for the description of the implementation.

When computing covariances, we have to select carefully the maximum frequency em-
ployed in the computation. When the frequency increases we observe the Epps eﬀect
[12], that is the absolute value of the correlation is biased toward zero, see [3]. This is
evident in Figure 4, where we show (left) the correlation as a function of the frequency
for two given bank trading strategies, and (right) the average positive and negative cor-
relation among all banks. It is important to remark that, given the deﬁnition of the
trading strategy ¯Vi, whenever a bank increases its cumulative volume, there is a bank
which decreases its cumulative volume, namely the bank who traded with it. Thus, neg-
ative correlations among trading strategies arise naturally. Since the less active bank in
our sample makes about 1,000 transactions, we can choose a maximum cut-oﬀ frequency
M = 500, where M is the largest Fourier harmonic used in (1). We compare two diﬀer-
ent frequencies, M = 100, corresponding to a time scale of nearly 10 days, and M = 500,
corresponding to a time scale of a couple of days. The largest the frequency the smallest
the error and the largest the bias toward zero. Figure 5, shows the distribution of the
correlations among trading strategies for M = 100 and M = 500. Correlations with
M = 500 are more centered around zero, because of the Epps eﬀect, nonetheless there is
not a great diﬀerence between the two, indicating that the bias is not so relevant. Thus
the following results are obtained using M = 500.

3 Principal Component Analysis

We analyze the correlation matrix of the trading strategies with the technique of random
matrix theory (RMT), in line with the work of [13,14] on stock prices. Random matrix

properties are derived in [15]. We ﬁnd that at least two eigenvalues do not ﬁt the
predictions of RMT, see the inset in Figure 6. The economic interpretation of this fact
is quite straightforward. If a bank lends and borrows over time in a non strategic way,
the correlation among trading strategies should conform to the predictions of RMT. The
fact that this is not the case means that banks do not behave randomly but a certain
level of coordination can be observed. [16] for example have shown that over 2002 small
banks have overall been acting as lenders, while larger banks have overall been acting
as borrowers.

We ﬁnally check whether there is some deterministic pattern in the evolution of trading
strategies over the maintenance period. To this purpose we compute the daily correlation
matrices, and average those which are at the same distance from the EOM. It is well
known that the behavior of banks is diﬀerent near the EOM [16,17,18]

We ﬁnd that the ﬁrst eigenvalue has a decreasing explanatory power over the mainte-
nance period, see Figure 7. On the contrary, the impact of the second largest eigenvalue,
shown in the inset of ﬁgure 7, is constant over the maintenance period.

In the very ﬁrst day of the maintenance period there is no distinct coordination among
the strategies. Coordination increases and then it declines gradually in the last few
days of the maintenance period. The interpretation of this empirical result is quite
straightforward. When the EOM day is approaching, banks take more care in fulﬁlling
their reserve obligations than in pursuing their preferred strategy (being a lender or
a borrower). Thus, they transact more for pure liquidity reasons, and the correlation
among trading strategies is less strong.

4 Communities structure

The aim of this section is to identify groups, or communities, of banks with similar
trading strategies. To help visualizing the results we use the following taxonomy. We
represent large Italian banks with blue circle, foreign banks with red circles, medium
Italian banks with green and small banks with yellow. The two banks labeled in pink

are two central institute of categories.

A simple way to identify communities in the system is to plot the correlation matrix
as a graph1, where banks are the vertices and links among them exist their strategies
are positively correlated. Figure 8 (left) clearly evidences two separate communities
of banks. To test that the two communities are not present only when selecting the
frequency M = 500 we have repeated the calculations by changing M. The results are
consistent at all frequencies. For example in ﬁgure 9 (top) we plot the results obtained
by selecting a lower frequency M = 25, which correspond to a time scale of about one
month and including all banks that trade at least once a month. Trading of bank reserves
at diﬀerent frequencies is driven in principle by diﬀerent consideration. On an intra-day
level, the main determinant is to target overnight balance without exceeding exposure
limits, while on a monthly level, the aim is to meet reserve requirements. Movements
in reserves at a lower frequency are mainly determined by the developments in banks’
other balance sheet positions over which banks have little control so that banks may not
be able to play strategically at low frequencies but they may be acting strategically over
longer time scales. Nonetheless we do not observe a clear diﬀerence in the correlation
matrices over the two time scales and we still observe the same two communities in the
correlation network in ﬁgure 9 (top).

To check that the method does not introduce spurious correlations and that communities
do not emerge purely from the fact that the in the market there are simultaneously

buyers and selles we have repeated the calculations of correlations by reshuﬄing the
transactions (i.e. assigning each transaction to a random buyer and a random seller).
The resulting graph is plotted in Figure 9 (bottom). In this case clearly no comunities
emerge.

In ﬁgure 10 we plot the minimum spanning tree generated by the correlation matrix
using the deﬁnition of distance given in [20,21]. On this tree, we can identify the same
two communities identiﬁed before. The branches departing from bank number 103 are
exactly the two groups on the left and the right of ﬁgure 8. In ﬁgure 11 we plot the
overall correlation matrix where banks are ordered according to the hierarchical tree of
ﬁgure 10, as in [22]. Again two distinct groups appear.

More sophisticated techniques for detecting community structure have been proposed in
the last few years [23,24,25,26,27,28]. Some of them are based on the edge betweenness
introduced by [29], also known as the NG–algorithm. To detect communities with this
method the algorithm removes the edges with largest betweenness and in doing so it
splits, step by step, the whole network into disconnected components. One problem
with this method is that there is not an established criterion to stop the splitting process
unless one knows, a priori, how many communities there are. To overcome such problems,
approaches based on the spectral analysis have been recently adopted [30]. This approach
does not need any a priori knowledge about the number of communities in the network
(which is the most common case in actual networks) but it is based on a constrained
optimization problem, in which we consider the nodes of the networks as objects linked
by an harmonic potential energy.

Many spectral methods [31,32,33] are based on the analysis of simple functions of the
(weighted) connectivity matrix A, identiﬁed here as the correlation matrix. In particular,
the functions of A adopted are the Laplacian matrix L = K − A and the Normal matrix
N = K −1A, where K is the diagonal matrix with elements kii = P
n
j=1 aij and n is the
number of nodes in the network. In most approaches, concerning undirected networks,

A is assumed to be symmetric. The matrix N has always the largest eigenvalue equal
In a network with an apparent cluster structure,
to one, due to row normalization.
the matrix N has also a certain number m − 1 of eigenvalues close to one, where m
is the number of well deﬁned communities, the remaining eigenvalues lying a gap away
from one. The eigenvectors associated to these ﬁrst m − 1 nontrivial eigenvalues, also
have a characteristic structure. Deﬁne xi as the position if the i-th vertex after sorting
vertices by the value of its corresponding component in one eigenvector. The components
corresponding to nodes within the same cluster have very similar values xi, so that, as
long as the partition is suﬃciently sharp, the proﬁle of each eigenvector, sorted by
components, is step-like. The number of steps in the proﬁle gives again the number m of
communities. Here we ﬁnd just one eigenvalue close to one (see ﬁgure 12), suggesting the
existence of only two communities. We analyze the component of the associated second
eigenvector in the left side of ﬁgure 13 which shows the characteristic step like proﬁle,
identifying the two communities. As shown in Table 2 the communities are the same as
those in ﬁgure 8. The group on the top right in ﬁgure 13 corresponds to the group on the
left in ﬁgure 8. On the right side of ﬁgure 13 we plot the second eigenvector components
for the correlation matrix obtained by reshuﬄing the transactions. The step like shape
is not visible in this case.

As the second eigenvalue approaches one, the communities becomes better deﬁned. Fig-
ure 12 shows that near the EOM communities become more pronounced. This is not
in contrast with our previous ﬁnding that the overall level of aggregation in the system
decreases when EOM approaches. In fact, the overall correlation may decrease while the
correlation of strategies inside the same community can become stronger. The separa-
tion between the two communities is less pronounced far from the EOM. We have also
observed that very few banks change community during the maintenance period.

Finally we note that the ﬁrst community is composed predominantly of large and foreign

16

banks (red and blue circles if ﬁgure 8) while the second community involves predom-
inantly small banks (green and yellow circles if ﬁgure 8). Furthermore, the ﬁrst com-
munity displays a pronounced geographical feature, that is all banks belonging to it are
located in the northern part of Italy.

5 Conclusions

We investigated the Italian segment of the European money market over the period
1999-2002 using a unique data-set from which it is possible to reconstruct the trad-
ing strategy of each participating bank. We used the Fourier method to estimate the
variance-covariance matrix that we analyzed, since it is the most suitable to the unevenly
structure of the data. We then analyzed the variance-covariance matrix using standard
PCA and tools borrowed from the analysis of complex networks. We ﬁnd that two main
communities emerge, one mainly composed by large and foreign banks, the other com-
posed by small banks. Banks act predominantly as borrowers or lenders respectively,
with an inversion of their behavior in July 2001. Moreover, the analysis reveals that
while overall trading strategies becomes less correlated when the EOM approach, the
communities become more pronounced on the EOM date.

We present an extensive statistical analysis of the results of all sports competitions in ﬁve major
sports leagues in England and the United States. We characterize the parity among teams by the
variance in the winning fraction from season-end standings data and quantify the predictability of
games by the frequency of upsets from game results data. We introduce a novel mathematical model
in which the underdog team wins with a ﬁxed upset probability. This model quantitatively relates
the parity among teams with the predictability of the games, and it can be used to estimate the
upset frequency from standings data.

What is the most competitive sports league? We
answer this question via an extensive statistical survey
of game results in ﬁve major sports. Previous stud-
ies have separately characterized parity (Fort 1995) and
predictability (Stern 1997, Wesson 2002, Lundh 2006) of
sports competitions. In this investigation, we relate par-
ity with predictability using a novel theoretical model in
which the underdog wins with a ﬁxed upset probability.
Our results provide further evidence that the likelihood
of upsets is a useful measure of competitiveness in a given
sport (Wesson 2002, Lundh 2006). This characterization
complements the myriad of available statistics on the out-
comes of sports events (Albert 2005, Stern 1991, Gembris
2002).

We studied the results of nearly all regular sea-
son competitions in 5 major professional sports leagues
in England and the United States (table I): the pre-
mier soccer league of the English Football Associa-
tion (FA), Major League Baseball (MLB), the Na-
tional Hockey League (NHL), the National Basketball
Association (NBA), and the National Football League
(NFL). NFL data includes the short-lived AFL. In-
complete seasons, such as the quickly abandoned 1939
FA season, and nineteenth-century results for the Na-
tional League in baseball were not included.
In to-
tal, we analyzed more than 300,000 games in over
a century (data source: http://www.shrpsports.com/,
http://www.the-english-football-archive.com/).

I. QUANTIFYING PARITY

The winning fraction, the ratio of wins to total games,
quantiﬁes team strength. Thus, the distribution of win-
ning fraction measures the parity between teams in a
league. We computed F (x), the fraction of teams with a
winning fraction of x or lower at the end of the season,

teams and all years using season-end standings. In our
deﬁnition, σ gives a quantitative measure for parity in a
league (Fort 1995, Gould 1996). For example, in base-
ball, where the winning fraction x typically falls between
0.400 and 0.600, the variance is σ = 0.084. As shown in
ﬁgures 1 and 2a, the winning fraction distribution clearly
distinguishes the ﬁve leagues. It is narrowest for baseball
and widest for football.

Do these results imply that MLB games are the most
competitive and NFL games the least? Not necessarily!
The length of the season is a signiﬁcant factor in the vari-
ability in the winning fraction. In a scenario where the
outcome of a game is random, i.e., either team can win
with equal probability, the total number of wins performs
a simple random walk, and the standard deviation σ is
inversely proportional to the square root of the number
of games played. Generally, the shorter the season, the
larger σ. Thus, the small number of games is partially
responsible for the large variability observed in the NFL.

II. QUANTIFYING PREDICTABILITY

To account for the varying season length and reveal the
true nature of the sport, we set up artiﬁcial sports leagues

TABLE I: Summary of the sports statistics data. Listed are
the time periods, total number of games, average number of
games played by a team in a season (hgamesi), variance in
the win-percentage distribution (σ), measured frequency of
upsets (q), and upset probability obtained using the theoreti-
cal model (qmodel). The fraction of ties in soccer, hockey, and
football is 0.246, 0.144, and 0.016, respectively.

where teams, paired at random, play a ﬁxed number of
games. In this simulation model, the team with the bet-
ter record is considered as the favorite and the team with
the worse record is considered as the underdog. The out-
come of a game depends on the relative team strengths:
with “upset probability” q < 1/2, the underdog wins,
but otherwise, the favorite wins. If the two teams have
the same fraction of wins, one is randomly selected as the
winner.

We note that a similar methodology was utilized by
Wesson who focused on the upset likelihood as a func-
tion of the ﬁnal point spread in soccer (Wesson 2002).
Also, an equivalent deﬁnition of the upset frequency was
very recently employed by Lundh to characterize how
competitive tournaments are in a variety of team sports
(Lundh 2006).

Our analysis of the nonlinear master equations that de-
scribe the evolution of the distribution of team win/loss
records shows that σ decreases both as the season length
increases and as games become more competitive, i.e.,
as q increases. This theory is described in the appendix
and more generally in Ben-Naim et al. 2006. The basic
quantity to characterize team win/loss records is F (x),
the fraction of teams that have a winning fraction that
is less than or equal to x. In a hypothetical season with
an inﬁnite number of games, the winning fraction distri-
bution is uniform

wins, the greater the disparity between teams. Perfect
parity is achieved when q = 1/2, where the outcome
of a game is completely random. However, for a ﬁnite
and realistic number of games per season, such as those
that occur in sports leagues, we ﬁnd that the variance
is larger than the inﬁnite game limit given in Eq. (2).
As a function of the number of games, the variance de-
creases monotonically, and it ultimately reaches the lim-
iting value (2).

We run numerical simulations of these artiﬁcial sports
leagues by simply following the rules of our theoretical
model. In a simulated game, the records of each team
are updated according to the following rule:
if the two
teams have a diﬀerent fraction of wins, the favorite wins

winner is chosen at random. Using the simulations, we
determined the value of qmodel that gives the best match
between the distribution F (x) from the simulations to
the actual sports statistics (ﬁgure 1). Generally, there is
good agreement between the simulations results and the
data, as quantiﬁed by qmodel (table I).

−

To characterize the predictability of games di-
rectly from the game results data, we followed the
chronologically-ordered results of all games and recon-
structed the league standings at any given day. We then
measured the upset frequency q by counting the fraction
of times that the team with the worse record on the game

date actually won (table I). Games between teams with
no record (start of a season) or teams with equal records
were disregarded. Game location was ignored and so was
the margin of victory.
In soccer, hockey, and football,
ties were counted as 1/2 of a victory for the underdog
and 1/2 of a victory for the favorite. We veriﬁed that
this deﬁnition did not have a signiﬁcant aﬀect on the
results. The upset probability changes by at most 0.02
(and typically, much less) if ties are ignored altogether.
We note that to generalize our model to situations with
ties, it is straightforward to add a second parameter, the
probability of a tie, into the model deﬁnition.

Our main result is that soccer and baseball are the
most competitive sports with q = 0.452 and q = 0.441,
respectively, while basketball and football, with nearly
identical q = 0.365 and q = 0.364, are the least (Stern
1997, Stern 1998).

There is also good agreement between the upset prob-
ability qmodel, obtained by ﬁtting the winning fraction
distribution from numerical simulations of our model to
the data as in ﬁgure 1, and the measured upset frequency
(table I). We notice however a systematic bias in the
estimated upset frequencies: the discrepancy between q
and qmodel grows as the games become less competitive.
Consistent with our theory, the variance σ mirrors the
bias, 1/2
q (ﬁgures 2a and 2b). Tracking the evolu-
tion of either q or σ leads to the same conclusions: (1)
MLB games have been steadily becoming more compet-
itive (Gould 1996), (2) NFL has dramatically improved
the competitiveness of its games over the past 40 years,
and (3) over the past 60 years, FA displays an opposite
trend with the games becoming less competitive.

III. ALL-TIME TEAM RECORDS

In our theory, both the season length and the upset
probability aﬀect the broadness of the win fraction dis-
tribution. However, in a hypothetical season with an
inﬁnite number of games, the distribution is governed by
the upset probability alone. In this case, the bias 1/2
q
and the variance σ are equivalent measures of the com-
petitiveness, as indicated by (2).

−

The all-time records of teams provide the longest pos-
sible win-loss record. This comparison is of course lim-
ited by the small number of teams, that varies between
26 and 37 (we ignored defunct franchises and franchises
participating in less than 10 seasons), and the signiﬁcant
variations in the total number of games played by the

win-loss records is reasonably close to the uniform dis-
tribution suggested by the theory (Fig. 3 and Table II).
The slope of the line in ﬁgure 3 was obtained using the
theory: the upset probability qall was estimated from the
observed variance σall using Eq. (2). This provides addi-
tional support for the theoretical model.

time winning record is in line with the rest of our ﬁnd-

ings: soccer and baseball are the most competitive sports
while basketball and football are the least. We note that
the win fraction distribution is extremely narrow, and
the closest to a straight line, for baseball because of the
huge number of games. Even though the total number
of games in basketball is four times that of football, the
two distributions have comparable widths. The fact that
similar trends for the upset frequency emerge from game
records as do from all-time team records indicate that the
relative strengths of clubs have not changed considerably
over the past century.

IV. DISCUSSION

In summary, we propose a single quantity, q, the
frequency of upsets, as an index for quantifying the
predictability, and hence the competitiveness of sports

leagues. This quantity complements existing methods
addressing varying length seasons and in particular, com-
petitive balance that is based on standard deviations in
winning percentages (Fort 2003). We demonstrated the
utility of this measure via a comparative analysis that
shows that soccer and baseball are the most competitive
sports. Trends in this measure may reﬂect the gradual
evolution of the teams in response to competitive pres-
sure (Gould 1996, Lieberman 2005), as well as changes
in game strategy or rules (Hofbauer 1998). What plays
the role of ﬁtness in this context is in open question.

In our deﬁnition of the upset frequency we ignored is-
sues associated with unbalanced schedules, unestablished
records, and variations in the team strengths. For exam-
ple, we count a game in which a 49-50 team beats a 50-49
team as an upset. To assess the importance of this ef-
fect we ignored all games between teams separated by
less than 0.05 in win-percentage. We ﬁnd that the up-
set frequency changes by less than 0.005 on average for
the ﬁve sports. Also, one may argue that team records
in the beginning of the season are not well established
and that there are large variations in schedule strength.
To quantify this eﬀect, we ignored the ﬁrst half of the
season. Remarkably, this changes the upset frequency by
less than 0.007 on average. We conclude that issues asso-
ciated with strength of schedule and unbalanced sched-
ules have negligible inﬂuence on the upset frequency.

It is worth mentioning that our model does not ac-
count for several important aspects of real sports com-
petitions. Among the plethora of such issues, we list a
few prominent examples: (i) Game location. Home and
away games are not incorporated into our model, but
game location does aﬀect the outcome of games. For ex-
ample, during the 2005 baseball season 54% of the total
team wins occurred at home. (ii) Unbalanced schedule.
In our ﬁxed-game algorithm, each team plays all other
teams the same number of times. However, some sports
leagues are partitioned into much smaller subdivisions,
with teams playing a larger fraction of their schedule
against teams in their own subgroup. This partitioning
is eﬀectively the same as reducing the number of teams,
an eﬀect that we found has a small inﬂuence on the dis-
tribution of win fraction. (iii) Variable upset probability.
It is plausible that the upset probability q depends on
the relative strengths of the two competing teams. It is
straightforward to generalize the model such that the up-
set frequency depends on the relative strengths of the two
teams and this may be especially relevant for tournament
competitions.

Despite all of these simplifying assumptions, we see the
strength of our approach in its simplicity. Our theoreti-
cal model involves a single parameter and consequently,
it enables direct and unambiguous quantitative relation
between parity and predictability.

Our model, in which the stronger team is favored to
win a game, enables us to take into account the varying
season length and this model directly relates parity, as
measured by the variance σ with predictability, as mea-

4

sured by the upset likelihood q. This connection has
practical utility as it allows one to conveniently estimate
the likelihood of upsets from the more easily-accessible
standings data. In our theory, all teams are equal at the
start of the season, but by chance, some end up strong
and some weak. Our idealized model does not include the
notion of innate team strength; nevertheless, the spon-
taneous emergence of disparate-strength teams provides
the crucial mechanism needed for quantitative modeling
of the complex dynamics of sports competitions.

One may speculate on the changes in competitiveness
over the years. In football there is a dramatic improve-
ment in competitiveness indicating that actions taken by
the league including revenue sharing, the draft, and un-
balanced schedules with stronger teams playing a tougher

most stable sport, the gentle improvement in competi-
tiveness may indeed reﬂect natural evolutionary trends.
In soccer, the decrease in competitiveness over the past
60 years indicate a “rich gets richer” scenario.

APPENDIX A: THE THEORETICAL MODEL

In our model, there are N teams that compete against
each other. In each game there is one winner and one
loser, and no ties are possible. In each competition, the
team with the larger number of wins is considered as
the favorite, and the other team as the underdog. The
winner of each competition is determined by the following
rule: the underdog wins with upset probability q, and the
q. If the two
favorite team wins with probability p = 1
competing teams have identical records, the winner is
chosen randomly.

Our theoretical analysis is based on a kinetic approach.
We set the competition rate to 1/2, so that the time
increases by one when every team plays one game, on
average. Then the average number of games played by a
team, t, plays the role of time. Also, we take the limit
of large t so that ﬂuctuations in the number of games
vanish.

Let gk(t) be the fraction of teams with k wins at time
t. We address the case where any two teams are equally

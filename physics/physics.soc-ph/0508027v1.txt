Collaboration networks are studied as an example of growing bipartite networks. These have
been previously observed to have structure such as positive correlations between nearest-neighbour
degrees. However, a detailed understanding of the origin of this phenomenon and the growth
dynamics is lacking. Both of these are analyzed empirically and simulated using various models.
A new one is presented, incorporating empirically necessary ingredients such as bipartiteness and
sublinear preferential attachment. This, and a recently proposed model of team assembly both agree
roughly with some empirical observations and fail in several others.

INTRODUCTION

The study of networks has gained much attention in
the physics literature recently [1, 2, 3, 4]. The physicists’
view on networks is to look at them as objects of statis-
tical mechanics and study them using the corresponding
tools. The availability of large databases has made it pos-
sible to do empirical studies of large networks of diﬀerent
disciplines. Great numbers of such networks have been
identiﬁed and studied in the literature, the emphasis be-
ing mostly on the basic characteristics of the networks,
such as the degree distribution, the clustering coeﬃcient
and the average shortest path length. However, it has
also been observed that the degrees of nearest neighbour
nodes are not statistically independent but mutually cor-
related in practically every network [5, 6, 7, 8]. In empir-
ical observations, it is typically seen that technological
and biological networks have negative correlations, also
termed disassortative mixing, whereas social networks
tend to have positive correlations [9]. The forming of
triads (i.e. fully connected triplets) [10], network bipar-
titeness [11] and hierarchical structure of social networks
[12] have been suggested as reasons for the assortative
mixing. It has also been found out that the presence of
correlations might have consequences regarding several
dynamical models on networks [13, 14].

In this article, we take a close, empirical look at the
degree-degree correlation structure of social collabora-
tion networks. These networks are by force bipartite,
in contrast to many others. A bipartite graph is a graph
with two kinds of vertices, say, A and T , in which there
are only edges between two vertices that are of diﬀerent
kinds. The A nodes can be thought of as social actors or
collaborators and the T nodes as social ties or collabo-
ration acts. Typical examples of these networks are the
movie-actor network (the movies are the collaboration
acts) and scientist-article networks where the scientists
(the collaborators) work together on the articles which
play the role of collaboration acts.

From a bipartite network, one can construct its unipar-
tite counterpart, the so-called one-mode projection onto
actors (ties), as a network consisting solely of the actors
(ties) as nodes, two of which are connected by an edge

FIG. 1: A graphical illustration of the one-mode projection.
Above the ﬁlled circles denote social ties, the open ones social
actors and the lines the links between them. Below, each
social actor is drawn again, now with links between them in
the one-mode projection visible, i.e. two actors are connected
if they participate in the same tie.

for each social tie (actor) they both participate in (enlist
as participants). For example, in the one-mode projec-
tion two scientists are connected to each other as many
times as they have co-authored a paper (an alternative
deﬁnition not considered here would be to use this to de-
ﬁne a weight for the link). The one-mode projection is
illustrated in Fig. 1.

Three important questions arise in this context. First,
what is the structure of the bipartite network? The rel-
evant quantities are stated in the next section. Second,
what can be stated in general of the one-mode projec-
tion graph and its correlations? We consider this mostly
via the average nearest-neighour degree (ANND). Here,
there is the main empirical observation that the ANND
follows a power-law scaling. Moreover the degree distri-
butions decay faster than scale-free ones and we discover
sublinear eﬀective preferential attachment (PA) rules, in-
dependent of time.

Third, we consider two models. First, a growing bipar-
tite network model is introduced such that it incorporates
sublinear preferential attachment. We perform simula-

tions of this model, and a team assembly model intro-
duced recently by Guimer´a et al. [15]. Both models can
reproduce roughly the one-mode actor degree distribu-
tions and the latter also the power-law scaling of the actor
ANND. However, the assembly model fails in matching
the sublinear (empirical) PA rule, and in matching the
clustering as such.

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discussed
the quantities measuring correlations and earlier studies.
In Section 3, results of empirical measurements are pre-
sented. Section 4 deﬁnes the model we construct, and
presents numerical simulation results. Finally, Section 5
ends the paper with discussion and conclusions.

Another important quantity in networks is clustering
or network transitivity, which is a measure of the ten-
dency to ﬁnd fully connected triangles in the graph. It
can be measured from several diﬀerent perspectives and
the terminology in the literature varies between diﬀerent
sources. Here, notation and terminology adapted from
Ref. [17] is used and is as follows.

Let mnn(x) be the number of links between the nearest
neighbours of a given vertex x with degree k. The max-
imum number of such connections is k(k − 1)/2. Deﬁne
the local clustering of node x as

Cx =

mnn(x)
k(k − 1)/2

.

II. BIPARTITE NETWORKS

Now, the global clustering characteristics of the net-

work are the following.

A. Deﬁnitions

Let P (k) be the degree distribution in the one-mode
projection onto actors, i.e. the probability that a ran-
domly selected actor has k links. This quantity often
exhibits a fat tail that can be approximated with a
power-law. The degree-degree correlations in the net-
works are seen from the joint probability distribution
P (k, k′) where (2 − δk,k′ )P (k, k′) is the probability that
a randomly selected edge connects nodes with degree k
and k′. In undirected graphs (which are considered here),
P (k, k′) is necessarily symmetric with respect to k and
k′. In uncorrelated networks, it takes the form

• The degree-dependent clustering. This is the av-
erage of the local clustering of nodes with a given
degree, i.e.

C(k) = hCxik ,

(5)

where the subscript k emphasizes the fact that the
average is taken only over nodes x with degree k.

• The average clustering, which is the average of the
local clustering over all nodes in the graph. It is
deﬁned in terms of the degree distribution P (k)
and the degree-dependent clustering C(k) as

P (k, k′) =

kk′P (k)P (k′)
hki2

.

(1)

C =

P (k)C(k) .

(6)

Xk

The joint distribution P (k, k′) is often hard to mea-
sure empirically due to a lack of a representative sam-
ple, i.e. in real-life networks there are typically only a
few edges connecting nodes with given degrees k and k′.
Thus, another measures for the correlations have been
devised, the most important of these being the average
nearest-neighbour degree (ANND), which is the average
degree of the nearest neighbours of nodes of degree k.
Subsequently, it can be expressed as

• The clustering coeﬃcient which is three times the
ratio of the total number of loops of length three in
the graph to the total number of connected triplets
of vertices. It can also be deﬁned in terms of P (k)
and C(k) as

c =

k k(k − 1)P (k)C(k)
hk2i − hki

.

P

hknn(k)i = hki

k′ k′P (k, k′)
kP (k)

.

P

(2)

In networks without degree-degree correlations, the
three clustering characteristics in Eqs. (5), (6) and (7)
equal each other [17]

This quantity is less vulnerable to statistical ﬂuctuations
than P (k, k′) but naturally less informative.

The degree-degree correlations can also be described
by a Pearson correlation coeﬃcient r between nearest-
neighbour degrees. It is deﬁned as [6, 16]

r = hki

k k2hknn(k)iP (k) − hk2i2
hkihk3i − hk2i2

.

P

(3)

C(k) = C = c =

(hk2i − hki)2
N hki3

,

where N is the number of vertices in the network.

B. Models

If the network is uncorrelated, the ANND is a constant
hknn(k)i = hk2i/hki and the correlation coeﬃcient van-
ishes. A positive value of r and an increasing hknn(k)i
are signs of assortative mixing.

Earlier studies of collaboration networks are mostly
centered around unipartite networks, with a few excep-
tions [11, 16, 18, 19, 20]. Growing unipartite networks
are relevant to the present treatment since they tell how

2

(7)

(8)

the degree distribution depends on the growth rule. If
uniform attachment is used, the degree distribution be-
comes exponential [1] in contrast to a linear preferential
attachment rule, with a power-law degree distribution
[21]. Between these two extremes lies sublinear prefer-
ential attachment, i.e. a network growth rule that states
that a new node connects to an existing one with prob-
ability proportional to kα (0 < α < 1), where k is the
degree of the existing node. This kind of growth leads to
a stretched exponential degree distribution

P (k) ∝ k−α exp(−

µ
1 − α

k1−α) ,

(9)

where µ depends on α and satisﬁes 1 ≤ µ ≤ 2 [22, 23].

Another family of preferential attachment rules is given

by attachment probabilities Πk of the form

Πk ∝ k + A ,

(10)

where A is a parameter also termed additional atractive-
ness [1]. This leads to scale-free networks with a tunable,
A-dependent, degree distribution exponent γ. The net-
works develop degree correlations such that for A > 0,
hknn(k)i ∼ log(k) whereas for A < 0, a decaying power-
law hknn(k)i ∼ kβ with β < 0 is recovered [24].

The reference model

is the bipartite conﬁguration
model [11, 25].
In it, all actors and ties are created
ﬁrst, assigned degrees from given degree distributions and
linked randomly such that the degrees are fulﬁlled. It has
been proved mathematically [9] that this model always
leads to a non-negative assortativity coeﬃcient. Despite
of this, the correlations are clearly too weak to explain
those in the empirical data [16].

Recently Ramasco et al. [16] have introduced a model
of a growing bipartite collaboration network, which is
deﬁned as follows. At each time step, a new tie with
n actors is added to the network. Of these, m(< n) are
new, i.e. are not currently a part or the network. The rest
n − m of them are chosen from the set of pre-existent
actors with probability proportional to the number of
ties q they have already participated in, i.e. by using
linear preferential attachment. Ramasco et al. arrive at
a scale-free degree distribution P (k) ∼ k−γ in the one-
mode projection onto actors with

γ = 2 +

m
n − m

.

(11)

While the model above can be solved analytically, it
fails to explain some features when compared to empiri-
cal data [16]. The most important deviations are in clus-
tering and correlations. To overcome this, Ramasco and
co-workers introduced the aging of actors as an additional
property of the model. In their model, the actors age such
that the probability that an actor is alive (i.e. capable of
participating in new ties) after having participated in q
ties is

Palive(q) =

1
exp{− q−q0

,
τ } ,

(cid:26)

if q < q0
if q ≥ q0

.

(12)

3

There is a sure survival up to participation in q0 ties
and an exponential decay thereafter with a characteristic
time τ .

Introducing the aging renders the model analytically
unsolvable and the degree distribution develops a cutoﬀ
at large values of the one-mode degree k. A similar cutoﬀ
is observed experimentally and Ramasco and co-workers
use its position and steepness for determining the values
of the aging parameters q0 and τ . With the aging one is
able to turn the assortativity coeﬃcient (Eq. (3)) positive
and increase the clustering coeﬃcient (Eq. (7)) so that
both get closer to empirically observed values.

Guimer´a et al. [15] have introduced a model of team
assembly mechanisms that is quite similar to the one dis-
cussed above.
In their model, new teams are formed,
and their members are selected according to the following
rules. At each time step a new team with m members is
created. For each member an incumbent, that is a mem-
ber that is already part of the network, is chosen with
probability p, and a new one is created with probability
1−p. If the previous member was an incumbent, the next
one is selected from its collaborators with probability q,
otherwise the selection is performed as above.

Identifying the teams with the social ties and the team
members as the social actors, the team assembly model
is a version of a growing bipartite network model.
In
it, the preferential attachment rule consists of two ingre-
dients: The ﬁrst incumbent member of each team and
the subsequent ones with probability 1 − q are selected
with random attachment, whereas the rest are chosen us-
ing linear preferential attachment, which comes here into
play implicitly since a random previous collaborator of a
member is chosen [10]. Guimer´a et al. have found that
the degree distribution of the one-mode projection of the
resulting graph mimicks empirically measured distribu-
tions reasonably well [15].

Somewhat similar studies have also been conducted by
B¨orner et al. [18], Goldstein et al. [19] and Morris [20].
A common goal of these is to introduce realistic models
of collaboration networks. However, they do not pay any
attention to degree-degree correlations.

III. EMPIRICAL RESULTS

A. Analyzed networks

In this work, the empirically analyzed data comes from
two sources: from the Internet Movie Database (IMDB)
[26] (an older but preprocessed data set is also available
at the web site [27]) and from the arXiv.org preprint
server [28].

The actor–movie network from the IMDB is a bipar-
tite network consisting of actors and movies (social ties)
where an actor is linked to a movie if he acted in it. The
network is pretty comprehensive, containing around 770
000 actors in about 430 000 ﬁlms, the oldest one of which
dates back to 1890. The IMDB reports the on-screen

credits as its primary data source.

The arXiv.org preprint server hosts a collection of elec-
tronically transferable preprints in several disciplines of
physics and related sciences. From their data, a bipar-
tite graph of scientists (social actors) and articles (social
ties) can be constructed. It is reasonable to assume that
diﬀerent disciplines are rather unconnected when author
collaboration is considered. Thus it is natural to ana-
lyze them separately. For this, three diﬀerent disciplines,
which contain most of the articles stored in the database,
were chosen, namely astrophysics (astro-ph), condensed
matter physics (cond-mat) and the phenomenology of
high energy physics (hep-ph). The number of articles
in other disciplines is not large enough to permit mean-
ingful data analysis. The networks analyzed here contain
articles up to the end of 2003. Note that though in the
bipartite graph each edge is unique, multiple ties shared
between the same pair of actors will produce multiple,
degenerate links.

The basic parameters of these four networks can be
found in Table I. The values of the clustering coeﬃcient,
the average clustering and the assortativity coeﬃcient
diﬀer from those in Refs. [6, 16, 29], since newer versions
of the data are used. The connectivity of the network
was also studied, leading to the conclusion that all four
networks consist of a giant component and a very small
number of nodes outside it; the second largest compo-
nent in the condensed matter network is composed of
19 scientists, for instance. In other words, they are far
from any kind of percolation transition whether in the
bipartite form or in the one-mode projection.

B. Degree distributions

The degree distribution P (qa) of the actors in the bi-
partite graph form is plotted in Fig. 2. Logarithmic bin-
ning is used to reduce the eﬀect of statistical ﬂuctuations.
All four data sets are roughly ﬁtted by a power-law de-
gree distribution P (qa) ∼ q−γa
with γa ≈ 1.6 in the

low-k region, but there is a noticable high degree cutoﬀ.
This is very similar in all the cases considered.

The degree distribution of the ties P (qt) is plotted in
Fig. 3. The movie–actor network data and the cond-mat
and hep-ph scientist collaboration networks show an ex-
ponentially decaying degree distribution P (qt) ∼ e−qt/q0
with q0 ≈ 13.4, 2.0 and 1.0 for the actor, condensed mat-
ter and high energy physics data sets, respectively. The
astro-ph network is an exception since it clearly exhibits
a power-law degree distribution for the ties (the inset of
Fig. 3), i.e. P (qt) ∼ q−γt
with γt ≈ 2.7. This hints to
the direction that the collaboration patterns in the astro-
physics community diﬀer essentially from those in other
disciplines studied here. However, as seen below, most
of the characteristic quantities of the networks are unaf-
fected by this change, which is thus largely irrelevant.

The scientist–article degree distributions are clearly not scale-
free, but more like of the stretched exponential form (Eq. (9))
with α ≈ 0.5.

onto actors is plotted in Fig. 4. From the ﬁgure we see
that the degree distribution in the actor–movie network
has a power-law tail P (k) ∼ k−γ with γ ≈ 1.9, and a
lump in the low degree region, which is also somewhat
visible in Fig. 3.

In the scientist-article collaboration networks, the de-
gree distribution is clearly not a power-law, but has a
less broad character. The distributions seem to ﬁt the
stretched exponential form of Eq. (9) with α ≈ 0.5. The
observations made here about the degree distributions
are compatible with previous studies [16, 30].

C. Clustering and correlations

The degree-dependent clustering (naturally, in the one-
mode projection) of Eq. (5) is plotted in Fig. 5, from
which we see that the clustering is huge (very close to
one) for vertices with small degrees and gets lower with
an increasing k.

The

average nearest-neighbour degree
hknn(k)i
(Eq. (2)) as a function of node degree k is plotted in
Fig. 6. All networks behave similarly with respect to
this quantity; a power-law scaling

hknn(k)i ∼ kβ

(13)

with β ≈ 0.3 is observed in each one, with some small
deviations. At high degrees k a cutoﬀ, possibly a trace of
the ﬁnite size of the networks, can be seen in each data
set.

Since the ANND is an increasing function of k, one can
conclude that signiﬁcant assortative mixing is present in
the network, i.e. the degrees of adjacent nodes are posi-
tively correlated. This can also be seen from the experi-
mentally measured assortativity coeﬃcient r in Table I.

that for small degrees k the clustering is huge. The noisi-
ness at high k (k > 100 for the scientist collaboration data,
k > 1000 for the actor data) comes from the low statistical
quality of the data in these regions (cf. the degree distribution
in Fig. 4).

β ≈ 0.3 can be roughly ﬁtted. This power-law behaviour is
the most important empirical observation made in this work.
Since the ANND is an increasing function of k, there is assor-
tative mixing in the networks as typically in social networks.

The diﬀerences in the amplitudes of the ANND curves
in Fig. 6 are explained by the diﬀerences in the aver-
age nearest-neighbour degrees hknni = hk

D. Preferential attachment

From the empirical data, the (one-mode) preferen-
tial attachment (PA) rule can also be measured quite
straightforwardly given that the order of appearance (or
preparation) of the articles or movies can be deduced
from the available data, which is the case here. The
measurement method has been devised by Newman [30]
and it goes as follows. Let Tk be the relative probability
that a new node added at a given time t is connected
to a pre-existing node with degree k. Now, the absolute
time-dependent probability that this node connects to a
node of degree k is given by

Pk(t) =

Tknk(t)
N (t)

,

(14)

where nk(t) is the number of nodes with degree k right
before the addition of the new node and N (t) is the total
number of nodes in the graph at the same time. Given
these quantities, the preferential attachment rule Tk can
be measured by making a histogram as a function of k to
which a new link is added with the weight of N (t)/nk(t)
each time one is created.

If there is no preferential attachment, Tk is indepen-
dent of k. On the other hand, with preferential attach-
ment, Tk is a growing function of the degree k and for
instance in the Barab´asi-Albert model [21] Tk ∝ k by
deﬁnition.

The empirically measured PA rules are plotted in
Fig. 7. All of them are well ﬁtted by power-laws Tk ∼ kα
with high-k-cutoﬀs. For the actor-movie network the
measured value of the exponent α ≈ 0.65, for the as-
trophysics network α ≈ 0.6, and for the other networks
α ≈ 0.75. Diﬀerent decades (movies) or years (articles)
of accumulation of the data are shown separately to il-
lustrate that the eﬀective PA rule is independent of time.
At low degrees (k < 10) the behaviour of the actor data
set diﬀers from the other ones. In essence, Tk is approx-
imately constant in this region. This means that for low
degrees the actual value becomes irrelevant and may per-
haps indicate a sublinear version of Eq. 10.

The position of the cutoﬀ increases as a function of
time, and thus as a function of the network size. A
similar cutoﬀ can be observed when measuring the PA
rule retroactively for a network generated numerically,
so we conclude that the cutoﬀ is merely a ﬁnite-size ef-
fect, which does not need to be taken into account ex-
plicitly while building a simulational model. Similarly,
in the team assembly model, the retroactively measured
PA rule is a power-law with a cut-oﬀ, but with α ≈ 0.4
and independent of the simulation parameters. We have
not tried to consider the “Tk” for the tie one-mode pro-
jection, though it would naturally be of some interest.

Measurements of the preferential attachment rule in
the arXiv.org collaboration networks were also reported
in Ref. [30] by Newman. The measurement method used
is the same as in this work. Surprisingly, Newman con-
cludes that the preferential attachment is linear, which

6

is in striking contrast to the results obtained here. Since
the data sets and the measurement method are appar-
ently the same, there remains only one possible expla-
nation. Newman considered the arXiv.org network as a
whole whereas in this work the division into disciplines
is used. Also Barab´asi et al. [29] have measured the PA
rule, but for diﬀerent networks. They discover exponents
0.75 and 0.8 for neuro-science and mathematics scientist–
article collaboration networks, respectively.

IV. SIMULATIONS

A. Bipartite model with sublinear preferential
attachment

Motivated by the empirical observations of the previ-
ous section, the following model of a growing bipartite
collaboration network is proposed.
It is also based on
that of Ramasco et al. [16] (see also Sec. II B), but it is
signiﬁcantly modiﬁed in order for it to be consistent with
empirical facts.

The model is as follows (the addition of a new tie is

illustrated in Fig. 8).

• At each time step, a new tie is added to the net-
work. The number of actors n of this tie is a ran-
dom variable whose distribution is given as an input
parameter. Since this distribution can be measured
experimentally, and the measured functional form
is to be used, there is no ﬁtting involved.

• Of these n actors each one has a given probability
p to be a new one, i.e. at a ﬁxed n the number of
new actors is a random variable with binomial dis-
tribution. The probability p can be estimated from
the data by selecting it such that, on the average,
the total number of actors in the end of the sim-
ulation equals that in the empirical network being
mimicked.

• The rest n − m of them are chosen from the pool
of pre-existent actors such that actor i gets chosen
with probability

i.e. with sublinear preferential attachment. The
corresponding rule of the model of Ramasco et al.
has α = 1.

The most important new ingredient, the sublinear
form of the PA rule, is justiﬁed by the measurements
in Sec. III D. Another quantum of motivation comes
from the fact that degree distributions which are not pure
power-laws have been measured (see Fig. 4 in Sec. III B)
and such degree distributions have been demonstrated
to be caused by sublinear PA. Even further motivation is
given by the studies of Onody and de Castro [31] where

PA rules are well ﬁtted by a power-law Tk ∼ kα with a cutoﬀ and they appear to be independent of time. Numerically we get
that α ≈ 0.65 for the actor network, α ≈ 0.6 for the astrophysics network and α ≈ 0.75 for the other networks. The solid lines
are guides to the eye.

sublinear PA was found to lead to positive degree–degree
correlations in terms of the assortativity coeﬃcient r.

Since diﬀerent models of triad formation (TF) have
been found to lead to increased clustering, closer to what
is observed in real networks, it is also useful to look at
how a similar process aﬀects the correlation structure.
To this end, we have implemented an additional TF step
in the spirit of Holme and Kim [10] into the sublinear
model. The step of selecting the pre-existent actors to
be linked to a new tie is modiﬁed as follows. The ﬁrst
actor is always selected using sublinear preferential at-
tachment as in the unmodiﬁed version. For each subse-
quent actor, there is a probability pT F that the actor is
selected randomly from the previous collaborators of the
previously selected actor. A similar ingredient is already
present in the original formulation [15] of the team as-
sembly model, where the parameter q plays the role of
the triad formation probability.

B. Numerical results

In the simulations reported in this section, the num-
ber of ties in a simulated network is always Nt = 49000,
and the fraction of new social actors in a given tie is
pnew = 0.202 for both models. This selection of the pa-
rameters comes directly from the empirics of the con-
densed matter collaboration network. In the simulations
of the team assembly model, the probability to select a
previous collaborator of an incumbent is pT F = 0.9 unless
otherwise mentioned. This choice leads to the correct or-
der of magnitude in the clustering of the resulting graph,
as will be seen below.

The degree distribution in the one-mode projection
onto actors is plotted in Fig. 9 for the empirically mea-
sured condensed matter collaboration network and for
simulations of the sublinear model with diﬀerent values
of α together with a simulation of the team assembly

and in simulations of the sublinear model with diﬀerent values

distribution as expected [16], where as that with α = 0.75

model.
It is seen that the simulation of the sublinear
model with α equal to the experimentally measured ef-
fective one (Fig. 7) mimicks the empirical degree distri-
bution signiﬁcantly better than the one using the linear
PA rule. The latter leads to a scale-free degree distri-
bution as predicted [16]. Also the team assembly model
is capable of reproducing the empirical degree distribu-
tion reasonably well. In the rest of this paper, the value

α = 0.75 is used unless otherwise mentioned.

The degree-dependent clustering C(k) of Eq. (5) in
the one-mode projection is plotted in Fig. 10 for the
condensed matter collaboration network and for simula-
tions both of the sublinear model and the team assembly
model. From the ﬁgure, it can be seen that for the sub-
linear model without triad formation and for the team
assembly model, the simulated clustering diﬀers notably
from the empirical one, although the latter one is clearly
of the right order of magnitude. On the other hand,
for the sublinear model with a high probability for triad
formation, the empirics and the simulation are in good
agreement.

The

hknn(k)i
average nearest-neighbour degree
(ANND) is plotted in Fig. 11 for the condensed matter
empirical data set and for simulations of both mod-
els. The ﬁgure shows that the team assembly model
reproduces the correlation structure of the empirical
network reasonably well in the intermediate-k regime:
both appear to roughly scale as hknn(k)i ∼ kβ with
β = 0.3 and approximately agree in the amplitude.
However, the simulation diﬀers from the data at both
ends of the k scale. On the other hand, the simulations
of the sublinear model show a similar scaling but with a
diﬀerent exponent (β ≈ 0.15).

To study the eﬀect of the exponent α on the scaling of
the ANND in the sublinear model, it is plotted in Fig. 12
for several simulation runs. For α = 1, we see that there
are no degree-degree correlations at all. This case corre-
sponds to the model of Ramasco and co-workers without
aging. For lower values of α, the ﬁgure shows that pos-
itive correlations are present and the ANND scales as a
power-law of the vertex degree k as above. The value
of β depends continously on α as seen in the inset of

i.e. no degree-degree correlations are observed, and for α < 1,
β grows as α decreases leading to positive correlations. The

To see how to the triad formation aﬀects the scaling
of the ANND, it is plotted for several values of pT F in
Figs. 13 and 14 for the sublinear and team assembly mod-
els, respectively. In both cases, it is clearly seen from the
ﬁgures that the triad formation process has no eﬀect at
all. Thus, we conclude that this kind of process can not
be held responsible for the observed correlations.

rule for the team assembly model is plotted in Fig. 15. It
is clearly seen that the rule is, again, a sublinear power-
law with α ≈ 0.4 and with a cut-oﬀ that is very similar
to the empirical ones (cf. Fig. 7) and to those in the
simulations of the sublinear model (not shown). This is
surprising since, at the ﬁrst sight, one could anticipate
that the combination of attachment rules in the team as-
sembly model leads to a compound rule of the form k+A.
However, the bipartiteness comes into play, and this phe-
nomenon shows that it can indeed aﬀect essentially the
network structure. It can also be seen that the eﬀective
attachment rule is time-independent.

We ﬁnally compare the models with the one-mode pro-
jection onto social ties instead of social actors. The em-
pirical results and comparisons to simulations are shown
in Figs. 16 and 17 for the degree distribution and the av-
erage nearest-neighbour degree, respectively. In both ﬁg-

and the data.

ures, the simulation parameters are selected to be those
of the condensed matter data set. The degree distribu-
tions in the scientist collaboration (article) networks are
quite interesting. There is a practically constant region
up to k ≈ 100 and a relatively rapid fall at larger degrees.
However, neither one of the simulational models is able
to capture this plateau. On the other hand, the movie
network appears to behave completely diﬀerently. There
is an approximate power-law with slope around −0.6 for
small k and no region of constant probability density can
be observed.

The average nearest-neighbour degree approximately
scales as a power of the degree k also in this projection.
The measured exponent β ≈ 0.44. As is the case also

bly model does a bit better but there are clear deviations
between it and the empirical data. In particular, both
low- and high-k ends diﬀer substantially.

V. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

In this paper, we have analyzed several bipartite col-
laboration networks empirically. Concerning their cor-
relation structure, the most important empirical ob-
servation is that the average nearest-neighbour degree
(ANND) in the one-mode projection onto social actors
scales as a power of the node degree as hknn(k)i ∼ kβ
with β ≈ 0.3. Similar scaling is also present in the projec-
tion onto social ties, i.e. articles or movies. The clustering
of the one-mode network(s) is considerable. The actor-
projection preferential attachment (PA) rule appears to
be a sublinear power-law, and independent of time.

We have also introduced a model, which is built on top
of this observation, in an attempt to explain the form of
the observed properties of the networks. The empirically
observed sublinearity of the PA rule has thus been in-
cluded in a numerical model.
In this case, the ANND
indeed scales as a power of k, but the numerical values
of the exponents do not match. In any case, the model
is capable of demonstrating that the form of the PA rule
can essentially aﬀect the correlation structure.

Another model of team assembly mechanisms [15] has
also been simulated. The ANND seems to ﬁt the (ac-
tor) empirical observations reasonably well: both roughly
scale as kβ with β ≈ 0.3. A common feature of both mod-
els is that they reproduce the degree distribution in the
one-mode projection rather well (see Fig. 9). However,

11

in the case of the sublinear model, using the correct, em-
pirically measured, value of the exponent α is necessary
for this result. On the other hand, the team assembly
model fails to explain the form of the k-dependent clus-
tering whereas the sublinear model with a high probabil-
ity for triad formation mimics the empirical data reason-
ably well. Note that a triad formation process does not
change the correlations in the models studied here.

Looking at the one-mode projection onto social ties in-
stead of actors reveals the inadequacy of the both models.
The empirically measured degree distribution and the
average nearest-neighbour degree both diﬀer from their
simulated counterparts. In eﬀect, we have observed that
even though several models can reproduce some proper-
ties of the anthropocentric projections onto actors, they
lack explanatory power when it comes to considering the
networks with their full bipartite structure intact. Sum-
marizing, there is a clear need for a more complex bipar-
tite growth model that accounts for both the clustering
and correlations of actors (authors) and ties (articles).
Since the bipartite structure changes by events in which
one tie is introduced together with several actors, this
means that the old actors’ eﬀective choice must follow
from a rule that measures the correlation structure in
more detail. One candidate would be to use k-connected
cliques in analogy to recent observations of the role of
such in network superstucture [32]. This would allow for
various ways of measuring the joint strength of interac-

tion between old actors. It is also clear that there are
substructures within subﬁelds. These point towards the
idea that the actors and ties have “hidden variables” that
should be taken into account. One practical prospect
would be to use e.g. the PACS indices to classify ties
(articles) and actors/authors, and investigate the role of
the both above ideas. Note that in all the cases here the
“invisible college” or giant component of the one-model
projection of actors includes really almost all of the ac-
tors. It is an open question how to deﬁne and measure
the “success” of an actor given this, and the performance
of current models - simple membership is not enough.

Even though several sources of positive degree-degree
correlations have been demonstrated here, there are still
open questions related to these. Most importantly, the
reason or origin of the speciﬁc form of the correlations
remains unknown. Perhaps one needs to deﬁne more in-
formative quantities for measuring the structure of the
original bipartite network. Studies on how the form of
the (one-mode) PA rule depends on the underlying ele-
mentary social phenomena oﬀer interesting avenues for
future work.

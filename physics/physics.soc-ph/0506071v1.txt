Abstract

We analyse the temporal changes in the cross correlations of returns on the New
York Stock Exchange. We show that lead-lag relationships between daily returns
of stocks vanished in less than twenty years. We have found that even for high
frequency data the asymmetry of time dependent cross-correlation functions has a
decreasing tendency, the position of their peaks are shifted towards the origin while
these peaks become sharper and higher, resulting in a diminution of the Epps eﬀect.
All these ﬁndings indicate that the market becomes increasingly eﬃcient.

Key words: Correlations; Market eﬃciency; Epps eﬀect;

1 Introduction

Correlation functions are basic tools in statistical physics. Equal-time cross-
correlations are related to thermodynamic second derivatives of potentials,
i.e. to generalised susceptibilities. Time-dependent cross-correlation functions
are important for determining transport coeﬃcients through the ﬂuctuation-
dissipation theorem. The Onsager relations of the transport coeﬃcients for
crossed eﬀects have their roots in the symmetry properties of time-dependent
cross-correlations. These properties are due to the detailed balance, which on
turn is the consequence of microscopic reversibility.

It is natural that in econophysics [1,2] much of the studies concentrates on the
correlations between time series obtained from the stock market. The study of
correlations of returns are crucial for understanding the mechanisms and the
structure of markets. It is enough to mention here the the central role played
by correlations in the classical theory of portfolio optimisation see, e.g. [2],
or the more recent results on their use in uncovering market taxonomy [3] by
using some clustering technique, e.g., that of a minimum spanning tree.

In spite of its noisiness [4,5], for daily returns the correlation matrix contains
much useful information [3,6,7]. Studying equal time correlations among stock
price changes during short intervals Epps found an interesting phenomenon
[8]: Correlations decreased with the decrease of the length of the interval for
which the price changes were calculated. Changes in prices (and thus loga-
rithmic returns) for longer intervals are merely non-overlapping sums of price
changes for shorter periods, thus the possible causes of this eﬀect can be non-
stationarity, lagged autocorrelations and lagged cross-correlations of stock re-
turns. Later other researchers studying correlations on high frequency data
reached the same conclusion, correlations decrease as the window width, in
which the returns are computed, decrease [9,10,11,12,13].

Of course, in contrast to physical systems, in economic systems detailed bal-
ance or time reversal symmetry is not present [14,15]. Nevertheless, the study
of time-dependent cross-correlations between stock returns is of great interest.
Time-dependent cross-correlation functions between pairs of companies may
give us information not only about the relation of the two companies but also
on the internal structure of the market and on the driving mechanisms.

In 1990, Lo et al. [16] studied an arbitrage possibility, called contrarian strat-
egy. They showed that the cause of the high proﬁtability of these contrarian
strategies is not only the pattern of overreaction on the market (negative
autocorrelation of returns in time) but also lead-lag eﬀects (positive cross-
correlations of returns in time). They studied weekly return data of stocks
from 1962 to 1987. They divided the almost 5000 studied stocks into 5 quin-
tiles of the same size, on the basis of their market values at the end of the
sample period (the 1st quintile containing the largest stocks and the 5th con-
taining the smallest ones). They created an equal-weighted return index for
each of the quintiles and calculated the time-dependent correlation matrices
with a time shift of one week, two weeks, three weeks and four weeks. Study-
ing these matrices they found a distinct lead-lag relation based on size. The
returns of smaller stocks were correlated with past returns of larger stocks but
not vice versa, resulting in a kind of forecastability of price changes.

Forecastability contradicts the eﬃcient market hypothesis. We know that the
speed of information ﬂow increases in time which is expected to act in favour of
eﬃciency. Indeed, Kullmann et al. [9] needed high frequency data of 1997 and

2

1998 to ﬁnd lead-lag eﬀects. They studied time-dependent cross-correlations
of stocks from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and found relevant lead-
lag eﬀects on the minute scale only. They ﬁxed thresholds to determine the
relevant correlations and also found that larger stocks were more likely to pull
smaller ones but there were some exceptions.

The time evolution of equal time correlations has been studied and for daily
data considerable robustness was observed [17,18], though at crash periods a
phase transition-like change appeared [19]. In the present paper we study the
evolution of time-dependent cross-correlation functions and equal time cross-
correlation coeﬃcients between logarithmic returns of stocks from the point
of view of market eﬃciency.

The paper is built up as follows. In Section 2 we ﬁrst introduce the data sets,
and the way we processed them in order to carry out the computations. After
that we describe the methodology of our computations. Section 3 contains the
results. The paper terminates with a discussion in Section 4.

2 Methodology

2.1 Data and data processing

We used two databases for our analysis. In the study of changes of cross-
correlations in high frequency data we used tick-by-tick data (containing every
trade for each stock) obtained from the Trade and Quote (TAQ) Database of
New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) for the period of 4.1.1993 to 31.12.2003.
We conﬁned ourselves to analysing the 190 most frequently traded stocks in
this period. The high frequency data obtained from the TAQ Database was
raw data. It contained many technical information of the NYSE stocks: prices
of trades, bid prices, ask prices, volume of trades, etc. There were separate
ﬁles containing the data for dividends of the stocks. To be able to carry out
computations, ﬁrst we had to make the dividend adjustment by using the
dividend ﬁles. Next, we created the logarithmic return time series from the
price time series. To avoid the problems occurring from splits in the prices
of stocks, which cause large logarithmic return values in the time series, we
applied a ﬁltering procedure. In high-frequency data, we omitted returns larger
than 5% of the current price of the stock. This retains all logarithmic returns
caused by simple changes in prices but excludes splits which are usually half
or one third of the price.

In the study of changes of time-dependent cross-correlation functions on daily
scale we used daily data of stocks, obtained from Yahoo ﬁnancial web page

3

[20] for the period of 4.1.1982 to 29.12.2000. These contained the daily closing
prices of 116 large stocks from NYSE. These data were needed because we
went back with our analysis to times preceding 1993. The daily prices were
already dividend adjusted and split adjusted so we did not need to carry out
a ﬁltering on them. We just created their logarithmic return time series for
the computations.

2.2 Equal-time and time-dependent correlations

We studied the cross-correlations of stock returns in function of time shift
between the pairs’ return time series. In the computations we used logarithmic
returns of stocks:

r∆t(t) = ln

p(t)

,

p(t

∆t)

−

where p(t) stands for the price of the stock at time t. The equal-time correlation
coeﬃcient ρA,B

∆t of stocks A and B is deﬁned by

∆t(t)rB
rA

∆t(t)

ρA,B
∆t = h

∆t(t)
i − h

The time-dependent correlation function C A,B
deﬁned by

∆t (τ ) between stocks A and B is

∆t (τ ) = h

The notion
σ2 is the variance of the return series:

h· · · i

stands for the time average over the considered period and

σ2 =

h

[r∆t(t)

r∆t(t)

− h

]2

.

i

i

Obviously the equal-time correlation coeﬃcient can be obtained by setting
τ = 0 in (3).

In order to avoid major return values in high frequency data, caused by the
diﬀerence in opening prices and previous days’ closing prices (which doesn’t
give us information about the average behaviour of returns), we took the
average in two steps. First we carried out the average over the intra-day periods
and then over the independent days. In the analysis of the daily data the
average was taken in one step over the time period examined.

We follow and brieﬂy summarise the method used in [9] in determining the
value of ∆t, the window width in which logarithmic returns are computed.
Since in high-frequency data the smallest interval between two trades is one
second, ∆t = 1 second seems to be at ﬁrst sight a natural choice. Nevertheless,

4

choosing such a short window when computing the logarithmic returns would
result in a too noisy correlation function. In order to avoid this problem we
chose a wider window for the computation of the logarithmic returns and
averaged the correlations over the starting points of the returns. In this way
the average in (3) means:

∆t(t)rB
rA

∆t(t + τ )

=

i

h

1
T

∆t−1

T /∆t

X
t0=0

X
k=1

∆t(t0 + k∆t)rB
rA

∆t(t0 + k∆t + τ ),

(5)

where the ﬁrst sum runs over the starting points of the returns and the second
one runs over the ∆t wide windows of the returns. Choosing this window wider
can be understood as an averaging or smoothing of the correlation function. On
the other hand, ∆t should not be chosen too large since this would cause the
maximum of the function to be indistinct. In accordance with market processes
and papers in the subject [9,14], we chose ∆t = 100 seconds 1 . When studying
daily logarithmic returns ∆t is obviously the smallest time diﬀerence in the
time series, i.e. 1 day.

3 Results

3.1 Time-dependent correlations on daily scale

As mentioned before, Lo et al. [16] found relevant correlations between weekly
returns of stocks data from the sixties, seventies and eighties. They found
that the returns of highly capitalised stocks pull those of lower capitalised
ones much stronger than vice versa. We studied these results from the point
of view of market eﬃciency. We computed the time-dependent correlations on
logarithmic returns obtained from daily closing prices of stocks for the period
of 1982 to 2000. On weekly returns we did not ﬁnd any relevant correlations.
Therefore we carried out our computations on time series of daily logarithmic
returns. To be able to investigate the average dynamics of the pulling eﬀect
(inﬂuence) of highly capitalised stocks on weaker ones, we had to introduce
categories of stocks. We divided the stocks in two equal size groups with respect
to their market capitalisation data of 31st December, 1999 [21]. We computed
an average logarithmic return time-series for each group. The average was
simply taken with equal weights as in A. Lo et al. [16]. We computed the time-
dependent correlations between the average logarithmic return time-series of
the group of larger stocks and that of the group of smaller stocks. Formally
this means that we used ∆t = 1 day and τ = 1 day in (3) in the calculation of

1 In [9] a model calculation was presented to demonstrate the method. In that
paper in Figure 1 the value of σ is erroneously given as 1000 instead of √1000.

∆t=1day (τ = 1 day). We carried out our computations in 2 year wide windows.
We shifted the window in every step with 1/10 year (25 trading days). On
Figure 1 we can see the correlation coeﬃcient changing through the years.
One can see the trend of the curve: the correlation is diminishing. From about
0.15–0.2 it decreased under the error-level by the end of the nineties. (The
outliers around 1987 are due to the biggest crash in the history of NYSE,
called Black Monday when the market index decreased by almost 20%. As
a consequence the motion of the returns got highly synchronised [19].) This
result tells us that pulling eﬀect between larger and smaller stocks on the daily
scale, i.e. the price of larger stocks pulling the price of smaller ones, essentially
vanished during the twenty years.

3.2 Time-dependent correlations on high frequency scale

We made computations in order to analyse the time-dependent cross-correlations
of high frequency logarithmic returns and the dynamics of these correlation
functions. Our computations were carried out in 11 consecutive periods of
the length of one year. Using (3), the window width in which the logarithmic
returns were calculated was ∆t = 100 seconds. We altered τ between -1000

seconds and 1000 seconds by steps of 5 seconds. For the time shift between
two stocks the value of 1000 seconds is beyond any reasonable limit because
of market eﬃciency, hence we also had the opportunity to study the tail of the
correlation functions, getting information about their signal-to-noise ratio. As
mentioned earlier, we conﬁned ourselves to analysing the 190 most frequently
traded stocks in this period.

We found that the time-dependent cross-correlation functions changed signif-
icantly in the eleven years studied. Through the years the maximum value
(Cmax) of the functions increased in almost all cases and the time shifts (τmax)
decreased. A few example plots showing these eﬀects can be seen on Figure
2. Figure 3 shows the average of the absolute value of maximum positions of
the time-dependent cross-correlation functions for every pair examined, as a
function of the years. The decreasing trend on the plot shows how the maxi-
mum positions approached the ordinate axis through the years. Figure 4 shows
the normalised distributions of the maximum positions of all time-dependent
correlation functions having a maximum of Cmax > 0.02, in order to ﬁlter
out those correlation functions where no relevant peak can be found, and
τmax < 300 seconds, in order to ﬁlter out peaks in the correlation function

due to the inﬂuence of two large logarithmic return values instead of relevant
lead-lag eﬀects, for the years 1993, 1999 and 2003. The distributions becom-
ing more and more sharply peaked near zero show the diminution of the time
shifts. The change is considerably strong, however, it is not monotonic. The
inset in Figure 4 shows the same distributions for the years 1993 and 2000.
We can see that the tails of the two distributions are very similar indicating
strong ﬂuctuations from the tendency of the changes in the time shift. Later
we will see in the case of the equal time correlation coeﬃcients also, that 2000
is an outlier year, this is possibly due to the dot-com crash.

The main cause of the changes in the correlation functions is the accelera-
tion of market processes. On the one hand computers and various electronic
equipments have spread in the last one or two decades and their capacity and
power have increased spectacularly, resulting in largely increasing the speed
of information ﬂow and of information processing. On the other hand faster
trading, shorter periods between two transactions decrease the time of reaction
of market participants to information. These cause the decrease in the time
shift between the returns of two stocks and thus the maximum position of the
time-dependent cross-correlation function to move towards zero. Furthermore,
the decrease of the time shift, as well as more synchronised reactions to the
information result in growing correlations of high frequency returns, i.e., in
the diminution of the Epps eﬀect (see next section).

years. The inset shows the same distribution for the years 1993 (circles) and 2000

strong deviations from the overall tendency.

3.3 Equal time correlations on high frequency scale

Since lagged correlations are possible causes of the Epps eﬀect, i.e. changes in
equal time correlations, we also studied the dynamics of equal time correlations
as a function of time. The computations were carried out in 11 consecutive
periods of the length of one year. Using (2), the window width in which the
logarithmic returns were calculated was ∆t = 100 seconds. To see the general
behaviour of the correlation coeﬃcients, we computed the equal weighted av-
erage of correlations for all pairs examined. Figure 5 shows the average of the
correlation coeﬃcients. A very strong increase can be seen in the correlation
coeﬃcients during the years. Nevertheless, the rise is not monotonic, a local
peak can be seen at the year 1997 and a local minimum can be seen at the year
2000. We made separate computations in case of closely and distantly related
stocks, where the relations were determined by the relative positions of the
stocks on the minimum spanning tree created for the period 1997–2000 [3,22].
We considered two stocks being close to each other if their distance was not

greater than 3 steps on the tree and being far from each other if their distance
was not smaller than 8 steps on the tree and for both the near related and dis-
tant related pairs we computed the average correlation coeﬃcients. We found
that the ratio of the two coeﬃcients was approximately constant until 1997,
while after 2000 the correlation coeﬃcient of far laying stocks increased faster
than that of close ones. This diﬀering change can be a sign of an equalisation
process of the correlations on the market.

The increase of the equal time correlations for high frequency data, i.e. the
diminution of the Epps eﬀect can be traced back to two reasons. One is the
vanishing lagging as shown in the previous paragraph. Furthermore, the grow-
ing speed of market processes can be understood as an expansion (lengthening)
of the time scale of trades on the stock market. Much more events, i.e. more
averaging occur in a certain length of time nowadays than did ten years ago.
This higher trading frequency acts against the Epps eﬀect: The expansion of
the time scale brings larger correlations.

4 Discussion

We investigated the changes of the average pulling eﬀect of weaker stocks
by stronger stocks on daily data of NYSE stocks. While for the beginning
of the eighties we have found an average correlation of 0.15–0.20 between
the logarithmic returns of smaller stocks and the previous days logarithmic
returns of larger stocks, this correlation decreased under the error level by the
end of the nineties. Since relevant time-dependent correlations on daily scale
can be exploited for arbitrage purposes, this ﬁnding is a sign of increasing
market eﬃciency. As trading and information procession get faster, the time
for each actor to react to the decisions of others’ decreases, so in order to
exclude arbitrage opportunities (eﬃcient market hypothesis), time-dependent
correlations on daily scale have to diminish and vanish, and correlations –
if they exist – must move to a smaller scale (higher frequency). This eﬀect
shows a considerable change in the structure of the market, indicating growing
market eﬃciency.

We analysed time-dependent correlation functions computed between high fre-
quency logarithmic returns of NYSE stocks. We have found that the positions
of the peaks of the functions moved towards zero, and the peaks got higher
and sharper in the eleven years examined. The peak approaching the ordi-
nate axis is also a sign of growing market eﬃciency. As trading got faster the
reaction times and therefore the time shifts decreased. Another consequence
of faster reactions to information is the diminution of the Epps eﬀect, i.e.
the equal time correlations of high frequency returns increase with time. Not
only higher correlations but also sharper peaks are due to increasing market
eﬃciency.

We studied the dynamics of equal time cross-correlations of stock returns on
high frequency data . We have learnt that on the average the correlations grew
strongly, though the changes were not monotonous. Correlations becoming
larger indicate the diminution of the Epps eﬀect. This can be understood by
the suppression of the lagging in the correlations as well as by the fact that
increasing trading frequency causes an eﬀective extension of the time scale,
enlarging the correlations.

The growing correlations and shorter time shifts in the time-dependent cross-
correlation functions are due to an increase of market eﬃciency and diminution
of the Epps eﬀect. Since the origins of these changes are present on all markets,
they should also be possible to ﬁnd on markets diﬀerent from the New York
Stock Exchange.

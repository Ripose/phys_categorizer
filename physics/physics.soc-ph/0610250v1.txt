A note on projections of Gibbs measures from a class
arising in economic modeling

Abstract: A result about projections of Gibbs measures from a particular class arising in

economic modeling is proved.

Introduction

Though individual human behavior undoubtedly is far more complex than the behavior of

individual objects in Physics, in the study of coordination phenomena in large economic

systems a reasonable approach is to restrict attention to certain known individual behavioral

regularities of consumers, traders etc which are simple and stable enough to allow Statistical-

Mechanics-based modeling. Such an approach leaves the state of any single individual random,

and makes instead the collective behavior of agents endogenous in a model, given the a-

priori known individual behavioral regularities which are formalized as conditional probability

distributions of individual variables [1]. Thus it corresponds to the Dobrushin-Lanford-Ruelle

approach to deﬁning Gibbs measures on countably-inﬁnite structures [2].

A natural property of models in Economics is that typically multiple individual variables of

distinct types must be introduced to characterize a single individual economic entity (“agent”),

and the macroscopic variables of the system are determined by the interaction of all variables

of all agents. Taking the statistical approach, one is thus led to Gibbsian ﬁelds with multiple

types of variables, with interactions both between variables of the same type associated to

diﬀerent agents and variables of diﬀerent types associated to the same agent. Since not

all types of variables are of immediate economic relevance, one is typically interested in

projected inﬁnite-volume Gibbs measures corresponding to a given subset of variable types.

In that context, the present note provides a result which for a speciﬁc structure of interactions

simpliﬁes the computation of the projected measure.

2 The result

Let Zd denote the set of agents in a large economy. To each agent i ∈ Zd there are associated
two variables xi and yi with values in X and Y, respectively. For concreteness, we consider
the case X = Y = Rn. We set ΩX = ΩY := (Rn)Zd
. By
B(ΩX) = B(ΩY ) and B(Ω) we denote the corresponding Borel σ-algebras of these spaces. For
Y := (Rn)Λ and ΩΛ := ΩΛ
any Λ ⊂ Zd we deﬁne ΩΛ
Y . An element of Ω will be
denoted by x × y.

and Ω := ΩX × ΩY = (Rn × Rn)Zd

X = ΩΛ

X × ΩΛ

A Gibbs measure µ on Ω appropriately represents an equilibrium state of a large multi-

component system with some given structure of local interactions between them. For any
ﬁnite Λ ⊂ Zd and any ¯x × ¯y ∈ Ω the corresponding conditional Gibbs measures in ﬁnite
volumes are of the form

µΛ (dxΛ × dyΛ | ¯x × ¯y) =

pΛ (xΛ × yΛ | ¯x × ¯y) dxΛdyΛ,

ZΛ(¯x × ¯y)

ZΛ(¯x × ¯y) :=

pΛ (xΛ × yΛ | ¯x × ¯y) dxΛdyΛ

ZΩΛ

is the so-called partition function, and pΛ (xΛ × yΛ | ¯x × ¯y) the conditional density for variables

in Λ derived from the Λ-Hamiltonian given the conﬁguration (¯x × ¯y)Λc.

Motivated by certain economic models, we consider Gibbs measures from the following

where

class:

Deﬁnition 2.1 Let G0 denote the class of Gibbs measures on Ω, whose corresponding condi-

tional distributions do not depend on condition from ΩX, i.e.

pΛ (xΛ × yΛ | ¯x × ¯y) = pΛ (xΛ × yΛ | ¯y)

Example 2.1 The following conditional densities fulﬁll the condition in the above deﬁnition

(see [3] for the economic motivation behind this particular interaction structure).

Since only a subset of variable-types is of direct economic relevance, one typically is led to

the problem of computing certain projected inﬁnite-volume Gibbs measures. In the speciﬁc

context speciﬁed above, we obtain the following result about the projected measure.

Theorem 2.1 Suppose that µ ∈ G0. Then the measure µY

ef f which is deﬁned on ΩY by

µY

ef f (A) = µ(ΩX × A), A ∈ B(ΩY )

will be a Gibbs measure whose corresponding conditional measures in ﬁnite volume Λ ⊂ Zd
are given by

µΛ, ef f (dyΛ | ¯y) =

µΛ(dxΛ × dyΛ | ¯y) =

where πΛ(· | ¯y) are the Gibbs speciﬁcations corresponding to the measure µ. We show that
the DLR-equations for the measure µY

But by the DLR-equations for the measure µ the latter expression is indeed equal to

µ(ΩX × A) = µY

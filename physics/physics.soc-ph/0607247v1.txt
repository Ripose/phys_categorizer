Abstract

Reliable calculations of ﬁnancial risk require that the fat-tailed nature of prices changes is in-

cluded in risk measures. To this end, a non-Gaussian approach to ﬁnancial risk management is

presented, modeling the power-law tails of the returns distribution in terms of a Student-t (or Tsal-

lis) distribution. Non-Gaussian closed-form solutions for Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall are

obtained and standard formulae known in the literature under the normality assumption are re-

covered as a special case. The implications of the approach for risk management are demonstrated

through an empirical analysis of ﬁnancial time series from the Italian stock market. Detailed com-

parison with the results of the widely used procedures of quantitative ﬁnance, such as parametric

normal approach, RiskMetrics methodology and historical simulation, as well as with previous

ﬁndings in the literature, are shown and commented. Particular attention is paid to quantify the

size of the errors aﬀecting the risk measures obtained according to diﬀerent methodologies, by

employing a bootstrap technique.

A topic of increasing importance in quantitative ﬁnance is the development of reliable

methods of measuring and controlling ﬁnancial risks. Among the diﬀerent sources of risk,

market risk, which concerns the hazard of losing money due to the ﬂuctuations of the prices

of those instruments entering a ﬁnancial portfolio, is particularly relevant.

In the ﬁnancial industry today, the most widely used measure to manage market risk is

Value-at-Risk (VaR) [1, 2]. In short, VaR refers to the maximum potential loss over a given

period at a certain conﬁdence level and can be used to measure the risk of individual assets

and portfolios of assets as well. Because of its conceptual simplicity, VaR has become a

standard component in the methodology of academics and ﬁnancial practitioners. However,

as discussed in the literature [2, 3], VaR suﬀers from some inconsistencies: ﬁrst, it can violate

the sub-additivity rule for portfolio risk, which is a required property for any consistent

measure of risk, and, secondly, it doesn’t quantify the typical loss incurred when the risk

threshold is exceeded. To overcome the drawbacks of VaR, the Expected Shortfall (or

Conditional VaR) is introduced, and sometimes used in ﬁnancial risk management, as a

more coherent measure of risk.

Three main approaches are known in the literature and used in practice for calculating

VaR and Expected Shortfall. The ﬁrst method, called parametric or analytical, consists in

assuming some probability distribution function for price changes and calculating the risk

measures as closed-form solutions. Actually, it is well known that empirical price returns,

especially in the limit of high frequency, do not follow the Gaussian paradigm and are char-

acterized by heavier tails and a higher peak than a normal distribution. In order to capture

the leptokurtic (fat-tailed) nature of price returns, the historical simulation method is often

used. It employs recent historical data and risk measures are derived from the percentiles of

the distribution of real data. A third approach consists in Monte Carlo simulations of the

stochastic dynamics of a given model for stock price returns and in calculating risk measures

according to Monte Carlo statistics.

Actually, reliable and possibly fast methods to calculate ﬁnancial risk are strongly de-

manded. Inspired by this motivation, the aim of this paper is to present a non-Gaussian

approach to market risk management and to describe its potentials, as well as limitations,

in comparison with standard procedures used in ﬁnancial analysis. To capture the excess

of kurtosis of empirical data with respect to the normal distribution, the statistics of price

changes is modeled in terms of a Student-t distribution (also known as Tsallis distribu-

2

tion [5]), which is known to approximate with good accuracy the distribution derived from

market data at a given time horizon [2, 4]. We present, in the spirit of a parametric approach,

closed-form expressions for the risk measures (VaR and ES) and critically investigate the

implications of our non-Gaussian analytical solutions on the basis of an empirical analysis of

ﬁnancial data. Moreover, we perform detailed comparisons with the results of widely used

procedures in ﬁnance. Particular attention is paid to quantify the size of the errors aﬀecting

the various risk measures, by employing a bootstrap technique.

NON-GAUSSIAN RISK MEASURES

Value-at-Risk, usually denoted as Λ⋆, is deﬁned as the maximum potential loss over a

ﬁxed time horizon ∆t for a given signiﬁcance level

⋆ (typically 1% or 5%). In terms of

price changes ∆S, or, equivalenty, of returns R

where ˜P∆t(∆S) and P∆t(R) are the probability density functions (pdfs) for price changes

and for returns over a time horizon ∆t, respectively. Actually, VaR represents the stan-

dard measure used to quantify market risk because it aggregates several risk component

into a single number. In spite of its conceptual simplicity, VaR shows some drawbacks, as

mentioned above.

A quantity that does not suﬀer of these disadvantages is the so called Expected Shortfall

(ES) or Conditional VaR (CVaR), E⋆, deﬁned as

and (4) are linear with respect to the spot price S0.

However, it is well known in the literature [2, 4, 9] that the normality hypothesis is often

inadequate for daily returns due to the leptokurtic nature of empirical data. For this reason,

a better agreement with data is obtained using fat-tailed distributions, such as truncated

L´evy distributions [4, 10] or Student-t ones. In order to characterize the excess of kurtosis,

we model the returns using a Student-t distribution deﬁned as

measures of risk, since the crossover values for the latter are much more stable than those

associated to the ﬁrst one. This result can be interpreted as a consequence of ES as a more

coherent risk measure than VaR.

EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS

The data sets used in our analysis consist of two ﬁnancial time series, composed of

N = 1000 daily returns, from the Italian stock market: one is a collection of data from the

Italian asset Autostrade SpA (from May 15th 2001 to May 5th 2005), while the other one

corresponds to the ﬁnancial index Mib30 (from March 27th 2002 to March 13th 2006). The

data have been freely downloaded from Yahoo Finance [11]. Other examples of analysis of

Italian stock market data can be found in [12].

In order to balance between accuracy and computational time, we estimate mean m

and variance σ from empirical moments. With this standard procedure, we measure daily

volatilities of the order of 1% for both time series: σAutostrade = 1.38% and σM ib30 = 1.16%.

Moreover, we ﬁnd quite negligible means: mAutostrade = 0.12% and mM ib30 = 0.02%. Using

the above m and σ values, we derive a standardized vector (with zero mean and unit variance)
r .

integral representation and therefore we implemented a numerical algorithm to search for

the minimum and solve the optimization problem. We measure tail parameter of 2.91 for

Autostrade SpA and 3.22 for Mib30. These values conﬁrm the strong leptokurtic nature of

the returns distributions, both for single asset and market index.

For completeness, it is worth mentioning that other approaches are discussed in the

literature to model with accuracy the tail exponent of the returns cdfs and are based on

Extreme Value Theory [13] and Hill’s estimator [14, 15].

COMPARISON OF DIFFERENT RISK METHODOLOGIES

In this Section we present a comparison of the results obtained estimating the market

risk through VaR and ES according to diﬀerent methodologies. The standard approach is

based on the normality assumption for the distribution of the returns. As discussed above,

we limit our analysis to 1000 daily data and we estimate the volatility using the empirical

second moment (the eﬀect of the mean is negligible). In order to avoid the problem of a

uniform weight for the returns, RiskMetrics introduces the use of an exponential weighted

moving average of squared returns according to the formula [7]

time t conditional on the realized R. In order to relax standard assumption about the return

pdf without loosing the advantages coming from a closed-form expression, we presented

above generalized formulae for VaR and ES based on a Student-t modeling of price returns.

As a benchmark of all our results, we also quote VaR and ES estimates following a historical

approach, which is a procedure widely used in the practice. According to this approach,

At a variance with respect to previous investigations [6, 16], we also provide 68% conﬁ-

To this extent, we implement a bootstrap technique [17]. Given the N measured returns, we

quantify the dispersion around ν∗b .

mate is close to zero and 68% CL interval is almost symmetric. In our numerical investi-

bootstrap 68% conﬁdence levels and to the comparison with the historical simulation. We

note also, from Fig. 3 and Table III, that Λ⋆ and E⋆ central values calculated according to

RiskMetrics methodology are quite ﬂuctuating and characterized by the largest CL bars.

The decreasing of

⋆ traduces in a major diﬀerentiation of the diﬀerent approaches.

In

P

general, we obtain the best agreement between the Student-t approach and the historical

simulation, both for Λ⋆ and E⋆, whereas, as before, the RiskMetrics methodology overes-

timates or underestimates the results of the historical evaluation and is aﬀected by rather

large uncertainties.

CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have presented a careful analysis of ﬁnancial market risk measures in

terms of a non-Gaussian (Student-like) model for price ﬂuctuations. With the exception of

Gaussian ones, the derived closed-form parametric formulae are able to capture accurately

the fat-tailed nature of ﬁnancial data and are in good agreement with a full historical

evaluation. We also proposed a bootstrap-based technique to estimate the size of the errors

aﬀecting the risk measures derived through the diﬀerent procedures, in order to give a sound

9

statistical meaning to our comparative analysis.

Possible perspectives concern the extension of our analysis to other time series, diﬀerent

ﬁnancial instruments and underlying distributions.

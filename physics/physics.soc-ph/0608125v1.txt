We analyze the public transport networks (PTNs) of a number of major cities of the world. While
the primary network topology is deﬁned by a set of routes each servicing an ordered series of given
stations, a number of diﬀerent neighborhood relations may be deﬁned both for the routes and the
stations. The networks deﬁned in this way display distinguishing properties, the most striking being
that often several routes proceed in parallel for a sequence of stations. Other networks with real-
world links like cables or neurons embedded in two or three dimensions often show the same feature
- we use the car engineering term harness for such networks. Geographical data for the routes reveal
surprising self-avoiding walk (SAW) properties. We propose and simulate an evolutionary model of
PTNs based on eﬀectively interacting SAWs that reproduces the key features.

INTRODUCTION

Taken the general interest in networks of man-made
and natural systems [1], it is remarkable that one of the
most commonly encountered networks, the urban public
transport network (PTN), is much less studied. The PTN
constitutes an example of a transportation network and
shares general features of these systems: evolutionary
growth, optimization, embedding into two-dimensional
(2D) space. However, as compared with other trans-
portation networks like airport networks [2, 3], railway
networks [4], or power grid networks [2, 5] much less is
known about the statistical and topological properties of
PTNs.

The few studies that have considered these questions
so far have either been performed on a subnetwork (tram,
subway) of a speciﬁc city like Boston or Vienna [6, 7, 8]
or they were limited by the number of cities or their
size. The recent thorough study of the bus and tram
networks of 22 Polish cities considered PTNs with up to
2811 stations [9]. Our preliminary work on some larger
networks [10] was restricted to only three cities (Berlin,
D¨usseldorf, and Paris). The present picture that emerges
from this research views PTNs as networks with small-
world properties and hierarchical organization as derived
from various network characteristics and their correla-
tions [9]. While indications for scale-free behavior have
been found these depend strongly on the interpretation
of the network.

The present article is based on a survey of selected ma-
jor cities of the world with PTN sizes ranging between
2000 and 46000 stations. Simulations of an evolutionary
growth model based on self-avoiding walks that we pro-
pose appear to reproduce most of the key features of these
PTNs. In addition to the standard characteristics of com-
plex networks like the number of nearest neighbors, mean

path length, and clustering we observe features speciﬁc
to PTNs due to their embedding in geographic space con-
strained by city structure. The most striking being that
often several routes proceed in parallel on a common road
or track for a sequence of stations. While other networks
with real-world links like cables or neurons embedded
in two or three dimensions often show similar behavior,
these can be studied in detail in our present case.

graph with single links. P-space: any two stations that are
serviced by a common route are linked. B-space: stations are
linked to the routes (open circles) they belong to. C-space:
routes are connected when they share a common station.

From maps of PTNs it is obvious that routes in gen-
eral do not follow the shortest path between their termi-
nal stations but rather meander through neighborhoods
and between sites of interest. We quantify this behavior
by analyzing geographical data. This leads us to model
the routes as self-avoiding walks that eﬃciently cover the
surface while the sites of interest introduce an eﬀective
attraction between them.

To work out the speciﬁc features of PTNs, it is natu-
ral to interpret the public transport system of a city in
terms of graphs, see Fig. 1. The primary network rep-
resentation, which we call L′
-space is deﬁned by a set of
routes each servicing an ordered series of stations. For

the PTNs studied so far, two diﬀerent neighborhood re-
lations were used that lead to diﬀerent representations.
In the ﬁrst one, called L-space, two stations are deﬁned
as neighbors only if one station is the successor of the
other one in the series of stations serviced by a route [7].
In the second one, the P-space, two stations are neigh-
bors whenever they are serviced by a common route [4].
Some of the speciﬁc features found in PTNs are more
naturally described in additional representations that we
introduce. A bipartite graph, B-space, is constructed by

representing both routes and stations as nodes of diﬀer-
ent type as depicted by ﬁlled and open circles in Fig.
1. The one-mode projection of the B-space graph to the
station nodes leads back to the P-space representation,
whereas the corresponding projection to the set of routes
results in a complementary C-space graph. Note that L′
diﬀers from L only by the presence of multiple links. In a
similar fashion one may deﬁne additional primed spaces
P′

by keeping multiple links also in P and C [11].

TABLE I: PTN characteristics in L- and P-representations. Index ’p’ indicates P-space characteristics. The last three rows
show data for simulated cities. We list the number of stations N , the number of routes M , the ratio κ of the second k2 to
the ﬁrst moment ¯k of p(k), the exponent γ, and the scale ˆk of ﬁts of p(k) to power and exponential laws and the ratio ˆk/¯k,
the average clustering coeﬃcient C and its ratio C to the ER-value CER = ¯k/N , the maximal ˆℓ and the mean ℓ shortest path
lengths; e.g.. an average trip between the 11026 London stations needs ℓp=3.2 changes with a maximum of ˆℓp=6; see text.

For our empirical survey we acquired publicly avail-
able data of the PTNs of 14 major cities from the web-
pages of local public transport organizations [12]. Table
I lists cities together with some of the characteristics ex-
tracted from our analysis. A more complete account will
be given in a separate publication [11]. To check for the
small-world properties of the networks we have analyzed
the mean and maximal shortest path lengths ℓ, ˆℓ. The
data for space L given in Table I show that these num-
bers are very small as compared to the number of nodes.
In the P-space the shortest path lengths ℓp, ˆℓp corre-
spond to the number of changes one should make trav-
eling between two given stations. From these data we
conclude that a typical station is within relatively short
reach from all other stations. As has been shown [13],

small world networks are also highly clustered as charac-
terized by the clustering coeﬃcient. The latter is deﬁned
by Ci = 2yi/ki(ki − 1) where ki is the degree of node
i and yi is the number of links between its neighbors.
The large ratios C = C/CER of the average values with
respect to those of Erd¨os-R´enyi (ER) random graphs of
the same sizes conﬁrm the high clustering that is present
in these networks.

A very fruitful concept that has lead to a unifying view
on complex networks and also leads to their classiﬁcation
is that of scale-free behavior [1]. If p(k), the probability
that given node of the network has degree k, follows a
power law p(k) ∼ k−γ, indicating a fat tail of the node
degree distribution, the network is said to be scale-free.
While many networks and in particular random graphs

have an exponentially or even faster decaying distribu-
tion p(k), it has been shown that an evolutionary growth
procedure with preferential attachment to high degree
nodes leads to scale-free behavior [14]. Furthermore, for
many applications scale-free and small world networks
emerge naturally upon optimization for minimizing both
the costs for communication and maintenance [15] which
are central criteria for the design of PTNs.

Using scaling arguments for tree graphs the depen-
dence of a number of properties of scale-free networks
on the exponent γ has been worked out. In particular,
the value of γ discriminates between diﬀerent classes for
the percolation behavior: if γ > 4, the behavior is equiv-
alent to that of networks with exponential p(k), while
it is qualitatively diﬀerent for γ < 4, moreover there is
no percolation threshold for 2 < γ < 3 [16]. The per-
colation threshold is given by: κ ≡ k2/¯k = 2. For the
PTNs studied this ratio is listed in Table I. Finding a
network with κ near the threshold means that it is vul-
nerable against failure in the sense that inactivating a
small number of nodes may break the network into dis-
connected clusters. The Table shows that all PTNs are
clearly above this threshold, for some of them κ indicates
an especially strong resilience against failure [11].

3

[9]. Fig. 2 however clearly indicates that the P-space
node degree distribution of the Los Angeles PTN follows
a power-law with exponent γp = 3.9. The same also ap-
plies to London and Paris, all other cities appear to have
an exponentially decaying p(k) in this space. Whereas
an exponential distribution may be explained by a ran-
dom placement of the routes, the power law found for
the three cities indicates that the routes are organized
in a correlated way. The deeper reasons for this special
behavior currently remain unclear.

Using the full information about the route paths as in-
cluded in the L′
-representation with colored links (Fig.
1), we can extract speciﬁc PTN features. One of them is
that several routes may proceed in parallel on a common
road or track for a sequence of stations. The emerg-
ing picture very much resembles networks found in car
wiring technology, where the term harness is used. To
quantitatively describe this characteristic we introduce
the harness distribution P (r, s): the number of sequences
of s consecutive stations that are serviced by r parallel
routes. In Fig. 3a we show the harness distribution for
the PTN of Sydney. The log-log plot indicates that also
this distribution appears to be scale-free. Similar behav-
ior was found for most of the cities included in our study.

More information can be gained by ﬁtting the degree
distribution to a power-law as above or to an exponen-
tial function p(k) ∼ exp(−k/ˆk) observing the quality of
the ﬁt.
In Table I we list the results of both ﬁts for
the L and P-spaces. In the L-space representation, the
p(k) of eight cities is found to be well ﬁtted by a power
law with γ values between 2.6 and 5. The corresponding
results for the exponential ﬁts for these cities are given
in parentheses. The other six cities are rather governed
by an exponentially decaying p(k) (for these, the power
law ﬁt is shown in parentheses). Whereas the scale-free
behavior in the L-space has also been seen in previous
work [9, 10], such behavior was ruled out for the P-space

The evidence for the scale-free properties of PTNs pre-
sented so far encourages us to propose an evolutionary

growth model for these networks along the following lines:
We model the grid of streets by a quadratic 2D lattice and
allow every lattice site ~r (street corner) to be a potential
station visited by e.g. k~r routes. The routes are mod-
eled as self-avoiding walks (SAWs) on this lattice. This
model captures the typical meandering of the routes to
optimize the the coverage of neighborhoods. Obviously,
real routes are also planned to access sites of interest.
These serve as points of attraction of the walks and ‘in-
tegrating out’ their speciﬁc locations one is left with an
eﬀective attraction between the routes.

The rules of our model are the following:

1. First route: construct a SAW of length n.

2. Subsequent routes: (i) choose a terminal station
at the lattice site ~r with probability q ∼ k~r + a;
(ii) choose a subsequent station of this route at a
neighboring site site ~r′ with probability q ∼ k~r′ + b;
(iii) repeat step (ii) until the walk has reached n
stations, in case of self-intersection discard the walk
and restart with step (i).

3. Repeat step 2 until m routes are created.

Implementing the model on a 2D lattice implies the as-
sumption of a PTN growing in a regular isotropic un-
correlated environment. While it is natural that the
routes should not intersect themselves, the hypothesis
that apart from the eﬀective attraction they otherwise
proceed randomly may not be obvious. SAWs are well
studied in physics to model scaling properties of poly-
mers and polymer networks [17]. In 2D, the end-to-end
distance R of a SAW of N steps is known to scale for
large N as R ∼ N ν with an exact result for the expo-
nent ν = 3/4 [18]. This result as well as other scaling
properties remain unperturbed even on a weakly disor-
dered lattice as long as the disorder is not long-range
correlated [19]. This supports our choice of disregarding
such possible disturbances of the lattice in our model.
We have tested this hypothesis using publicly available
geographical data [20] for the stations of the Berlin PTN.
Plotting the root mean square distance R as function of
the number of stations traveled starting from a terminal
we ﬁnd surprising agreement with the 2D SAW behavior
(see Fig. 4). Furthermore, the corresponding result for
a simulated city conﬁrms this picture. Apparently, the
SAW balances between area coverage and traveling time.
In Table I we have included the characteristics as ex-
tracted from simulated PTNs with m = 500 routes each
of n = 50 stations for typical parameters a and b.
In
particular our model is nicely suited to reproduce the
harnessing eﬀect of the PTNs as shown in Fig. 3b. Vary-
ing the parameter b for a = 0 we observe a crossover from
scale-free behavior in P-space for small b to an exponen-
tial one as b increases beyond 1. Some L-space charac-
teristics we left blank in the table due to artifacts of the

square lattice neighborhood. Although our growth rules
look very similar to usual network evolution by preferen-
tial attachment [14], there is no simple relation between
the parameters a and b and the exponent γ even in the
scale-free scenario. The principal diﬀerence of our algo-
rithm is that at each step we link an existing station to a
neighboring site which does not need to be empty. New
stations are then only added at the frontier of the PTN
cluster while high degree nodes (hubs) accumulate at its
center.

Our analysis of PTNs of so far unexplored sizes brings
about that very large PTNs may display scale free P-
space distributions and conﬁrms corresponding L-space
results [9, 10]. The surprising SAW behavior of the routes
encouraged us to analyze an evolutionary model of mutu-
ally attractive SAWs which reproduces a number of key
features of PTNs. In conclusion, we want to emphasize
the importance of the constraints that are imposed on
the network by the area consuming links when it is em-
bedded in a 2D space. The harnessing eﬀect presented
in this study being a ﬁrst example. Similar problems are
met e.g. for electric circuit design.

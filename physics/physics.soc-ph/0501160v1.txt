The Heider balance is a state of a group of people with established
mutual relations between them. These relations, friendly or hostile, can be
measured in the Bogardus scale of the social distance. In previous works on
the Heider balance, these relations have been described with integers 0 and
±1. Recently we have proposed real numbers instead. Also, diﬀerential
equations have been used to simulate the time evolution of the relations,
which were allowed to vary within a given range. In this work, we inves-
tigate an inﬂuence of this allowed range on the system dynamics. As a
result, we have found that a narrowing of the range of relations leads to a
large delay in achieving the Heider balance. Another point is that a slight
shift of the initial distribution of the social distance towards friendship can
lead to a total elimination of hostility.

1. Introduction

There is a long debate about essential diﬀerences between social and
natural sciences, and in particular between sociology and physics [1, 2]. In
these discussions, the term ’physics’ is used with its most deterministic and
methodologically clear part in mind, i.e. the Newton equations. However,
the proud claim of Newton: ”Hypotheses non ﬁngo” can hardly be repeated,
when talking about any branch of modern physics. In particular, statistical
mechanics is known to be a phenomenological science and the validity of its
results should always be conﬁrmed by experiment [3]. Statistical mechanics
is maybe a branch which is most comparable to sociology, for the great role
of the law of large numbers in both these sciences. On the other hand, in
sociology there is no unique and commonly accepted method, but rather

a rich set of schools, grown within diﬀerent intellectual traditions [4]. Its
most mathematical part, the game theory, was initialized by Janos von
Neumann in 40’s [5, 6]. However, most of the game theory is oriented
rationally, whereas the human mind is not [7]. It is of interest to develop a
quantitative theory of society, which could include this aspect of ours. Such
a theory was initialized (again in 40’s) by Fritz Heider [8, 9, 10].

The Heider balance (HB) is a concept in social psychology [11]. For the
purposes of this work, the following description will be suﬃcient. A group
of people is initially connected with relations which are randomly hostile or
friendly. These random relations cause a cognitive dissonance: which can
be of two kinds. First is when the relations of three people are mutually
hostile. Each member of this triad is willing to decide whom he dislikes less,
and in turn to improve relations with him. As this kind of relations usually
tends to be symmetric, the dissonance is removed by a friendship between
two persons, third one being excluded. Second case of the dissonance within
a triad is when two persons dislike each other, but both like a third one.
A mutual hostility between good friends of someone seems strange: if both
are OK, why they are as stubborn as not to recognize it? Usually either we
look for someone guilty and we like him less, or we try to invite them to
a consent. Then again, the stable situation in a triad is either two hostile
links, or a friendship. On the contrary, an unbalanced triad is of one or
three hostile relations. This recalls the concept of frustration in spin glasses
[12]; indeed, the product of three links is negative for an unbalanced triad,
positive for a balanced one.

As it was early recognized [13], a gradual modiﬁcation of the unbalanced
triads leads the whole system towards a separation of two subsets, with
friendly relations within each set and hostile relations between the sets.
This is the so-called ﬁrst structure theorem. For more detailed discussion of
this stage of work see Ref. [14]. Removing of the cognitive dissonance in the
sense explained above leads then to a kind of social mitosis [15]. Algorithm
of repairing the unbalanced triads was used in [15] to investigate the role of
initial distribution of relations, described as ±1 and eventually zero. The
approach was generalized recently [16] by the present authors with using real
numbers instead of integers.
In this model, each relation between group
members i = 1, ..., N is modelled by a matrix element r(i, j) ∈ (−R, R).
Such a relation is equivalent to a kind of social distance between i and j,
and it can be measured with polls in the Bogardus scale [17]. For brevity,
we denote r(i, j) ≡ r from now on.

The range (−R, R) is a limitation of relations from below and from
above, and its use is motivated by the fact that our feelings aﬃrmed openly
are usually moderate, not to insult the public opinion. In Ref. [16], R = 5.0
was used, and the initial distribution of r(i, j) was ρ(r) = 1.0 for r ∈

(−0.5, 0.5). The diﬀerence between initial and ultimate limit, i.e. between
0.5 and 5.0, was found to be large enough not to inﬂuence the time and dy-
namics of achieving the Heider balance, which were the same as for R = ∞.
However, it is of interest to investigate how the dynamics changes when R
decreases. Tightening of allowed range of the relations r is interpreted here
as Gedankenexperiment, where the public opinion becomes more restrictive.
To observe possible consequences of such a tightening is one of the aims
of this work. Another aim is to check an iﬂuence of the initial probability
distribution of r on the process dynamics. The same distribution is used for
all matrix elements r(i, j).

In subsequent section we recapitulate our formulation of the problem
of the Heider balance [16], including the equations of motion of the ma-
trix elements r(i, j). Section III contains new numerical results, which are
discussed in the last section.

2. The model

In the simplest picture, the group members can be visualised as nodes of
a fully connected graph, and the relations between them - as links between
the nodes. These relations are described by the matrix elements r(i, j),
i, j = 1, ..., N . The proposed equations of time evolution of the relations
[16] are

dr(i, j)
dt

= G[r(i, j), R] X
k

r(i, k)r(k, j)

(1)

with G[r, R] = 1 − (r/R)2 as a multiplicative factor which introduces the
limitation of r(i, j). For r(i, j) out of the range (−R, R), the time derivative
of r(i, j) is set to be zero. Initially, the matrix elements r(i, j) are random
numbers uniformly distributed in the range (−r0, r0), where r0 < R.
In
this way, the numbers r(i, j) will never leave the range (−R, R). The direct
form of the function G[r, R] is of minor importance here, as well as the as-
sumed values of r0 and R. We guess that the results should scale with r0/R.
For computational reasons, the function G is chosen to be as elementary as
possible. Diagonal elements r(i, i) are zero. For the sociological interpreta-
tion, the summation over the nodes k in Eq. 1 is crucial. It means, that
the velocity of change of the relations between i and j is determined by
the relations of i and j with all other group members. If both the relation
between i and k and the relation between k and j are friendly or both of
them are hostile, the relation between i and j is improved. On the contrary,
if (i, k) are friends and (k, j) are enemies, the relation between i and j gets
worse. The ruling principle is: ’my friend’s friend is my friend, my friend’s
enemy is my enemy, my enemy’s friend is my enemy, my enemy’s enemy is

4

my friend’ [9, 18]. Unlike the classic formulation in terms of integers [15],
here the above velocity depends also on the intensity of the relations, and
not only on their sign.

3. The results

In Ref.

[16] we have demonstrated that for large systems the time de-
pendence of the number of unbalanced triads is similar to the theta fuction:
initially ﬂat, after some time abruptly goes to zero. This kind of dynamics
of a social system can be considered as unwelcome, if we remember that the
Heider balance in a fully connected graph is accompanied to the division of
the group into mutually hostile camps. Also, as a byproduct of this kind of
removing of cognitive dissonance we get the relations polarized. This means
that members of each group strongly believe that their group is right, while
the other is wrong. We are interested in an inﬂuence of the narrowing of
the range (−R, R) on the time of reaching the Heider balance and on the
character of the process. The interest is motivated by the following ques-
tion: to what extent can the group unity be preserved if the dynamics of
the relations is bound? It is obvious that in the trivial limit of r0 = R = 0,
the relations do not evolve at all. However, as soon as R > 0, the ﬁxed
point r = 0 is not stable [16].

In Fig. 1 a, we show the time τ of getting the Heider balance as depen-
dent on the system size N , for various R. Here, the results are obtained for
systems somewhat larger, than it was shown in Ref. [16]. The results point
out that τ decreases with R, i.e. the whole process takes more time if the
relations are more limited. The same rule is demonstrated to be true in Fig.
1 b, where we show an example of the dependence τ (R) for a given system
size N . It seems that this time can go to inﬁnity if R is small enough.

We have also analyzed the system dynamics as dependent on the value
of R. As it was remarked in Ref.
[16], for N = 100 and higher the time
dependence of the number Nmin of unbalanced triads decreases abruptly
just before the balance is achieved. Some examples of such a course is given
in Fig. 2 a for R = 5.0. In the same conditions but for R = 1.0, the time τ
is much longer. Moreover, in the last stage the number Nmin changes very
slowly. Actually, for one of the examples shown in Fig. 2 b τ = 3.5. In
Figs. 2 a, b the vertical axis is in units #/(N − 2), where # is the number
of unbalanced triads. This scale is selected as to obtain unity when the
sign of only one link is diﬀerent than it should be in the balance state. In
this scale we can easily notice that the number of unbalanced triads varies
quickly indeed in Fig. 2 a, but quite slowly in Fig. 2 b.

All the results of Ref. [16] and those reported above are obtained for the
uniform initial distribution of the matrix elements r(i, j) with zero average.

R = 3, τ changes very slowly.

Within our sociological interpretation, this assumption can be interpreted
as some symmetry of relations, with equal number of their positive and
negative values and intensities. This symmetry can be broken if the initial
values of r(i, j) are randomly selected from the range (−r0 + ε, r0 + ε). If

large enough, the output of the dynamics is that there is no division of the
group. Instead, all relations become positive, i.e. r(i, j) > 0. A glance at

Fig. 3. Inﬂuence of a shift ε of the centre of initial distribution of r on (a) size Nmin
of smaller of two subsets, which appear after reaching the Heider balance, (b) the
time τ . As it is seen the plot (b), τ does not show any peculiar behaviour near the
transition point ε ≈ 0.036, where the smaller subset vanishes. These calculations
are made for N = 100.

Eq. 1 ensures that in this case all the matrix elements increase in time; then
this unity will continue forever. This is a kind of phase transition, with ε as
a control parameter. The role of the order parameter can be assigned to the

8

Heider˙balance

size Nmin of a smaller part of the group in the ﬁnal state, when all triads
are balanced. When the division does not take place, Nmin is zero. In Fig.
3 a, we show Nmin as dependent on ε. The plot is expected to be sharper
if N is larger, but the time of calculation increases with N at least as N 3/2
and therefore the precision of determining the transition point is limited.
As it can be seen in Fig. 3 a, this transition point is close to ε = 0.036. This
means that accordance is reached when less than 4 percent of the matrix
elements change their initial sign from negative to positive. We note that
in the vicinity of the transition, τ does not show any discontinuity. This
result is shown in Fig. 3 b.

We checked that τ displays a maximum at ε = 0. In particular, consider
the case when ε < −r0, i.e. all relations are initially hostile. Absolute values
of some of them are large, and the time derivatives of some others are large
as well. Then, the Heider balance is reached rather quickly. One could say
that a social state, when all relations are hostile, is rather unstable; soon we
decide to collaborate with those who are less abominable, than the others.

4. Discussion

Main goal of this work is to develop the mathematical reﬁnement [16] of
the problem of the Heider balance on networks. Already in previous works
[13, 14, 15], the problem remained somewhat aside from the main stream
of sociology, as taught in student textbooks [19, 20]. If the concept of the
balance is taken as granted, the next step should be to include it into more
established subjects, as the group dynamics [2, 10] and the game theory [6].
However, such a task excesses the frames of this paper.

It is tempting to interpret the results directly, taking literally all the as-
sociations suggested above. There, the limitation R can be seen as a variable
which reﬂects the amount of freedom allowed by the public opinion. If R is
large, strong feelings can be expressed freely and they inﬂuence emotions of
the others. If R is small, we speak mainly about the weather, and emotions
remain hidden. By an appropriate shift of average initial social distance
ε, we could manipulate the public opinion, at least temporarily preventing
social instabilities. These analogies or metaphors can be continued, but
we should ask to what extent all of that can be realistic. This question is
particularly vivid when mathematical models are laid out for a humanisti-
cally oriented audience, when equations and plots bear some magic force of
ultimate true. Doing the sociophysics, it is fair to make a short warning.
Deeper discussion of relations between sociology and natural sciences can
be found in Refs. [1, 2].

Our experience with mathematical models is that their internal logic is
false rarely, and errors are easy to be detected and eliminated. Often, the

Heider˙balance

printed on February 2, 2008

problem is rather with the model assumptions and interpretation - how they
ﬁt to reality? This point can be easily attacked by people without mathe-
matical education, and this kind of discussion can be equally instructive for
both sides. Indeed, a mathematical realization of a model is in many cases
correct, but its assumptions and interpretation - input and output - are no
more true when expressed with mathematical symbols, than with words.

Bearing this in mind, we see the validity of our results mainly in improv-
ing the relation between the Heider idea and its mathematical realization.
We mean that in order to symbolize interpersonal relations real numbers
can be used with more sociological reality than integers. We mean also that
diﬀerential equations are more appropriate to describe the time dependence
of human opinions, than just ﬂipping units from positive to negative. We
believe that in the present version, the model is improved. Internal logic of
its equations allows to draw the results, reported above. They may be true
or not - it depends on how the model is used. We hope it can be useful in
sociological applications.

Pricing European Options in Realistic Markets

Martin Schaden†
New York University, 4 Washington Place, New York, New York 10003

Abstract

We investigate the relation between the fair price for European-style
vanilla options and the distribution of short-term returns on the un-
derlying asset ignoring transaction and other costs. We compute the
risk-neutral probability density conditional on the total variance of the
asset’s returns when the option expires. If the asset’s future price has
ﬁnite expectation, the option’s fair value satisﬁes a parabolic partial
diﬀerential equation of the Black-Scholes type in which the variance of
the asset’s returns rather than a trading time is the evolution parame-
ter. By immunizing the portfolio against large-scale price ﬂuctuations
of the asset, the valuation of options is extended to the realistic case1 of
assets whose short-term returns have ﬁnite variance but very large, or
even inﬁnite, higher moments. A dynamic Delta-hedged portfolio that
is statically insured against exceptionally large ﬂuctuations includes at
least two diﬀerent options on the asset. The fair value of an option in
this case is determined by a universal drift function that is common to
all options on the asset. This drift is interpreted as the premium for an
investment exposed to risk due to exceptionally large variations of the
asset’s price. It aﬀects the option valuation like an eﬀective cost-of-carry
for the underlying in the Black-Scholes world would. The derived pricing
formula for options in realistic markets is arbitrage free by construction.
A simple model with constant drift qualitatively reproduces the often
observed volatility -skew and -term structure.

1 Introduction

An important result of modern ﬁnance is that the fair (no-arbitrage) price V
for a European-style option is the expected present value (PV) of its future
payoﬀ,

V = EQ[P V (payoﬀ)] .

(1)

The expectation in Eq. (1) is with respect to a risk-neutral (martingale) mea-
sure Q on the space of price-paths. The fundamental theorem of asset pricing2
ensures the existence of the risk-neutral measure Q in the absence of arbitrage

opportunities, but does not explicitly relate it to the process for the under-
lying. We shall see that in some cases of interest, the validity of Eq. (1) is
restricted to options with a bounded payoﬀ.

Instead of directly computing the expectation in Eq. (1) for European-style

options, we will consider the conditional expectation

EQ[P V (payoﬀ)
vf ] ,
|

(2)

with respect to volatility paths with the same total ﬁnal variance vf of the as-
set’s returns. Eq. (1) is recovered by taking the expectation over vf . For asset
prices that follow a diﬀusion process, the conditional expectation of Eq. (2)
turns out to be unique, but we will see that this generally is not true for
realistic processes.

The analysis of the fair value of European-style call and put options by
Black and Scholes3 was based on a stochastic model in which the returns of
the asset follow a random walk. The fair value CBS of an European-style call
in this model depends only on the asset’s spot price S0, the volatility σ and
risk-free rate r (both assumed constant), time to exercise T and the option’s
strike K. Dimensional analysis requires that

CBS(S0, σ, r, T ; K) = S0cBS(rT, σ2T ; K/S0).

(3)

Note that the valuation (3) of a European-style call depends only on the ﬁnal
variance vf = σ2T , and the integrated discount factor rT , rather than sepa-
rately on the volatility σ, risk-free rate r and time to expiration T . Assuming
that the (mean) risk-free rate is known, Eq. (3) can be inverted to give the
(implied) volatility σimplied
with which the Black-Scholes model would repro-
duce the observed spot price C of a call with time to expiration T and strike
K,

BS

σimplied
BS

= ˜σ(C/S0, rT, K/S0)/√T ,

(4)

where ˜σ is the dimensionless overall standard deviation of the distribution of
returns. Limitations of the Black-Scholes option pricing formula are expressed
by the fact that the implied volatility of European-type options generally is
found to depend on the strike K and time to expiration T . The volatility
implied by calls that are in-the-money very often is higher than that implied
by out-of-the-money calls. A graph of the implied volatility against the call’s
strike therefore tends to ”smile” (somewhat crookedly) rather than frown. The
eﬀect is referred to as the volatility -smile or -skew. The dependence of the
implied volatility on T is known as the volatility’s term structure.

The observed volatility skew has been traced to a number of causes. All
of them are related to a higher probability for exceptionally large ﬂuctuations

2

in the returns than the random walk model admits. Stochastic models that
simulate this eﬀect have been considered4, but a quantitative explanation of the
empirically observed ﬂuctuations has only recently been proposed5. Since the
observed large-scale ﬂuctuations in returns are not quantitatively reproduced
by a simple stochastic model it perhaps is of some interest to (re)examine
the problem of option pricing assuming as little as possible. The fair price
of an option in fact does not depend on many details of the process for the
underlying asset. Only the short-term transition probability is relevant for
a fully dynamic hedging strategy, but this strategy is quite diﬀerent for the
following three kinds of assets:

I The asset’s expected future price is well-deﬁned by the short-term tran-

sition probability of its returns.

II The variance of the short-term returns on the asset is ﬁnite, but the

asset’s expected future price diverges.

III The variance of the short-term returns on the asset diverges.

A normal distribution of the short-term returns is an example in the ﬁrst
class, but not the only one. Any distribution of returns that falls oﬀ suﬃciently
rapidly and in particular any distribution with compact support belongs to this
class. No-arbitrage arguments uniquely price European-style options on assets
in this class if the ﬁnal variance of the asset’s returns is known. It is possible
to construct a dynamic portfolio with just one kind of option (in addition to
the asset) that is without appreciable risk.

The other two classes sub-divide the category of assets with sub-exponential
short-term return distributions. Equities1, indices6 and commodities7 histori-
cally fall in the second class of assets and this case will therefore concern us
most.
It turns out that one still can construct a dynamic portfolio that is
without appreciable risk, but the portfolio in this case includes at least two
diﬀerent options on the underlying asset. A portfolio with just one option (and
the asset) cannot be insured against exceptionally large price ﬂuctuations of
the asset and is therefore not without risk. Although the risk-neutral condi-
tional expectation of Eq. (2) exists for options with bounded payoﬀs, it no
longer is uniquely related to the process for the underlying.

Very little can be said about the third possibility, the Paretian case. The
construction of a risk-free dynamic portfolio from options on the underlying
is no longer possible. Indeed, the notion that the variance of the returns is a
measure of risk has to be reexamined and Eq. (1) may not be very meaningful.
Since the variance of returns for assets on which vanilla options can be drawn
apparently is ﬁnite1,6,7, the Paretian case will not be further investigated here.

3

We proceed as follows. Using the variance of the asset’s returns as the
evolution parameter, the Black-Scholes analysis is extended to European-style
options on any class I asset in the next section. In section 3 we extend the
analysis to include options on assets that belong to class II (the realistic case).
Section 4 summarizes and discusses some aspects of the results.

2 A Variation on the Black-Scholes Analysis of Option Prices

It is useful to slightly generalize the Black-Scholes analysis to the case where
the volatility of the underlying can be an arbitrary function of time.

We will use the variance v of the asset’s returns rather than a (continuous)
trading time to parameterize the evolution of an option’s fair value. The
variance is a monotonically increasing quantity; a trading- or calender- time t,
can be viewed as deﬁning an instantaneous volatility σ(t):

(6)

[The origin of the time-scale here is chosen to coincide with the moment of
vanishing uncertainty in the asset’s price.] Eq. (6) enables one to formally
consider the evolution in ”time” as an evolution in the variance of the under-
lying’s returns (if the volatility is ﬁnite).

To compensate for the time value of money, all prices will be stated as
multiples of the price of an actively traded risk-free bond that matures when
the European-style option expires. The spot price of the bond is SB(t) and its
nominal value NB = SB(maturity). Since the transition probability is for the
returns rather than for the price of the underlying, it is convenient to convert
to the dimensionless variables,

x(t) := ln[S(t)/SB(t)] , k := ln[K/NB] .

(7)

Changes in the log-price x give the return on the underlying relative to the
return on the bond and k is the strike value of x. We assume that the fair
price C of a European-style call option at any moment depends only on the
time to expiration, the strike price and the spot prices for the underlying asset
and the bond. The fair call price in multiples of SB and expressed in the above
dimensionless quantities is denoted by,

ck(x, v) := C(S(t), SB(t), t; K)/SB(t) .

2.1 Generic Properties of the Short-Term Transition Probability

The dynamic hedging strategy of Black and Scholes that assigns a fair value to
a European-style call depends on the existence of a very simple portfolio that
is without appreciable risk for a suﬃciently short period of time.

Let the current log-price of the stock be x and the probability that the

stock will have an excess return between y

(9)

A small variance h of the transition probability corresponds to a short time
interval. The ellipses denote all additional quantities on which the transition
probability may depend, such as market- and economic- indicators, the weather
and political environment, etc.
In eﬀect, the transition probability for the
returns depends on the current time t, respectively on the variance v. One
fortunately does not require detailed knowledge of ph(y
x, v) to value an option
|
on the asset.

−

The transition probability Eq. (9) furthermore depends only on the excess
x rather than on x and y individually. This ﬁnancially plausible
return y
proposition can be cast in the form of a denominational argument: the prob-
ability for a certain change of the asset’s price should not depend on whether
a single bond with value SB(t) or a package of two, three, or for that matter
6.378 bonds is used as price reference. With the deﬁnition (7), this freedom in
the reference denomination implies that the transition probability is invariant
under (global) translations z of all log-prices,

where the latter expression is obtained by setting z = x.
It is important
that neither the variance h of the short-term returns nor the variance v of
the overall returns are aﬀected by this translation. Because the short-term
x, the
transition probability density ph depends only on the diﬀerence y
variance of the overall returns is additive: the current variance of the returns
v increases to v + h after the short time interval we are considering.

approaches the current log-price x and µ(h; v) must become arbitrarily small
0+. µ(h; v) is the expected excess return on the asset at a given point
for h
in time when the variance of the asset’s returns increases by h. It may appear
ﬁnancially reasonable to assume that µ(h; v) for h
0 has the expansion
µ(h; v) = a(v)h + b(v)h2 + . . .. However, ignoring transaction costs, very
short-term stock investments could have a higher expected rate of return than
long-term ones. To avoid the ﬁnancially unstable situation that the return
on very short-term investments becomes absolutely certain, it is suﬃcient to
require that,

The mean return in other words should not outstrip the width of the distribu-
tion of short-term returns.

Somewhat surprisingly perhaps, one does not require detailed knowledge of the
higher moments of the distribution of short-term returns.

2.2 The Black-Scholes Valuation of a European-Style Call

Emulating the analysis of Black and Scholes3, the fair value of a European-
style call is found by constructing a portfolio that is without appreciable risk
for suﬃciently small h. Consider a portfolio P of one European-style call with
∆ of the underlyinga. When the portfolio is set up at a log-price
strike K and
x for the asset, the value VP of this position is,

−

VP (x, v) = ck(x, v)

∆(x, v)ex

(15)

bonds at SB(v). If the hedge ratio ∆(x, v) is not changed, the value of this
portfolio (in bonds) when the variance of the asset’s returns has increased by
h becomes,

VP (y, v + h) = ck(y, v + h)

∆(x, v)ey,

(16)

if the stock’s excess return over this period is y
x. To avoid arbitrage, the
value of this position when the hedge is set up should be its expected future

value discounted by a factor that accounts for the risk of investing in portfolio
P . One thus quite generally comes to the conclusion that,

VP (x, v) = e−RP (h,v)

x, v)VP (y, v + h) .

(17)

−∞

The discount factor e−RP (h,v) is compensation for the excess risk associated
with holding the portfolio P rather than the (risk-free) bonds [by pricing rel-
ative to the bond, we already took the time value of money into account].
RP (h, v) depends not only on the perceived risk of the portfolio, but also
reﬂects the valuation of this risk by investors. The value of a certain risk
generally depends on the circumstances, that is on the time t, respectively on
the overall variance v. RP (0, v) = 0 in order for Eq. (17) to be consistent.
The absence of arbitrage opportunities requires that RP (h, v)
0 for all h.
If the portfolio is without appreciable risk over the interval h, RP (h, v) = 0
and Eq. (17) becomes the martingale hypothesis. Note that the general form
of Eq. (17) is valid for ﬁnite h and could be the starting point for valuing
hedge slippage.

(25)

Note that c−∞(x, v) = ex, is a particular solution to Eq. (24), because a
call with strike K = 0 has the same intrinsic value as the underlying. It should
be emphasized that the mean return µ(h; v) of the underlying asset does not
enter Eq. (24) as long as it satisﬁes Eq. (13).

Using the deﬁnitions (7) and (8) and assuming that the volatility is a
known function of the trading time t, Eq. (24) assumes a more familiar form
when the evolution is parameterized by t,

C(S, t; K) = ˜rP (t)C(S, t; K) .

(26)

The portfolio’s instantaneous overall return rate ˜rP (t) in Eq. (26) consists of
two parts: the (risk-free) return rate of the bond r(t) = S−1
B dSB(t)/dt and the
risk-premium of the portfolio,

˜rP (t) = r(t) + σ2(t)rP (v(t)) .

(27)

Eq. (26) is the partial diﬀerential equation of Black and Scholes3 for the
valuation of options with an in general time-dependent volatility and an option-
dependent discount rate ˜rP (t). However, Eq. (24) is not merely Eq. (26)
rewritten in terms of other variables: Eq. (24) remains valid even if the volatility
is stochastic or an unknown function of the trading time. Eq. (24) can still be
integrated in this case and shows that the fair value of a European-style option
depends only on the overall variance of the asset’s returns when it expires.

We have yet to show that the portfolio P with the hedge ratio (20) is (at
least formally) without appreciable risk and that rP (v) therefore vanishes in
the absence of arbitrage opportunities. ˜rP (t) = r(t) in Eq. (26) then does not
depend on the option and becomes the risk-free rate of the bond.

2.3 The Risk of Holding the Dynamically Hedged Portfolio P

A portfolio is without appreciable short-term risk compared to an investment
in the asset alone, if the variance of the portfolio’s return decreases faster than
the variance of the asset’s return, which is h. One thus has to show that

The variance of the returns on portfolio P therefore is of order h3/2 and the risk
of entering into this investment compared to an investment in the underlying
can theoretically be made as small as one wishes by rebalancing the portfolio
often enough (we are ignoring transaction costs). To avoid arbitrage, the
discount rate therefore must be the risk-free one. The portfolio P in this
sense is perfectly hedged over the short-term and we should set rP (v) = 0 in
Eqs. (24) and (27).

2.4 A Comment on Stochastic Volatility

The parabolic partial diﬀerential equation (24) was derived without specifying
a stochastic process for the asset’s price. Speciﬁc properties of the short-term
returns enter the solution to Eq. (24) only through the boundary conditions.
Integration of Eq. (24) for a European-style option requires knowledge of the
payoﬀ of the option and of the overall variance vf of the asset’s returns at
exercise. The option payoﬀ is readily expressed in terms of the value of a risk-
free bond that matures when the option expires. For European-style options
the only uncertainty thus is in the ﬁnal variance vf of the asset’s returns.

By construction, the price of a European-style call option does not depend
on the volatility path. Paths with the same overall variance vf of the asset’s
returns when the option expires give the same fair option price.

Eq. (24) implies that the fair value of an European-style option for a
given ﬁnal variance of Eq. (2) is the risk-neutral conditional expectation of the
option payoﬀ with the pdfc,

In the next section we will argue that this unfortunately does not appear to
be very realistic and Eq. (32) probably is not suﬃciently general to reproduce

The historical distributions for equities1, indices6 and commodities7 do not
belong to this class. Empirically the probability densities for short-term returns
have tails that fall oﬀ as a power in x only. For time intervals between 5 minutes

mainly comes from the exceptionally large ﬂuctuations, even though these are
not the most frequent. Truncating the expansion (18) about y = x in this case
gives an inaccurate representation of the portfolio’s variation in price and the
derivation of Eq. (24) is no longer valid.

The damage can be contained by considering only portfolios that are im-
mune to large variations in the price of the underlying. It is suﬃcient to restrict
to portfolios whose value is uniformly bounded by a ﬁnite constant Vmax(P ),

Examples of simple portfolios that are bounded in this manner are a vanilla put
or a covered vanilla call. For class II assets one can select those portfolios from
the above set that are bounded and without appreciable risk for suﬃciently
short periods of timee. Since the set of portfolios that satisfy (35) is smaller
than the set of admissible portfolios in the case of class I processes, it is not
surprising that the valuation of options on class II assets is less constrained.

The simplest bounded dynamic portfolio that is without appreciable risk
contains two European-style options on the asset that diﬀer in strike or time

where we have assumed that the expected short-term return on the asset satis-
ﬁes Eq. (13). The determinant of the 3
3 matrix is the result of combining the

expectations of the two determinants in Eq. (41). Because the portfolio value
is immunized against large price ﬂuctuations, the truncation of the transition
probability in Eq. (42) induces an error of order h3/2 only (see Appendix A
for details). For class II short-term returns, the valuation of a bounded Delta-
hedged portfolio thus eﬀectively is reduced to the class I case. One similarly
can show that the variance of VP is of order h3/2 and that P therefore is
without appreciable risk.

This is one partial diﬀerential equation for two unknown functions. However,
since the determinant vanishes only when the corresponding system of linear
equations is dependent, we can disentangle Eq. (43) into two linear partial dif-
ferential equations for each covered call separately – at the cost of introducing
a function α(x, v). Excluding the possibility that the value of a covered call

As noted before, since a call with strike K = 0 is worth the stock at exer-
cise, c−∞(x, v) = ex must be a special solution to Eq. (45) that does not
depend on α(x, v). The inhomogeneous term in Eq. (45) for the valuation of
call options therefore is a matter of consistency. Put-call parity implies that
a European-style put with the same strike and expiration date as a call sat-
isﬁes the homogeneous partial diﬀerential equation with the same α(x, v). By
repeating the arguments for two covered calls with diﬀerent expiration dates,
one concludes that α(x, v) also does not depend on the expiration date of an
option. α(x, v) in this sense is an universal function that does not depend on
speciﬁc properties of European-style options.

The function α(x, v)

= 0, can be viewed as a risk-premium on a covered
call (respectively a put). The reason for such a premium is evident from the
derivation: it represents the cost of insuring a simple Delta-hedged portfolio
with just one option against large ﬂuctuations in the price of the underlying.
Note that α(x, v) enters the evolution equation for options with bounded pay-
oﬀs as an eﬀective cost-of-carry for the underlying asset in the Black-Scholes
world would.

with mean instantaneous drift α(w = ln(n), v).]

A constant eﬀective risk premium on options was recently interpreted by
Derman11 as due to a stock’s intrinsic time-scale generated by short-term
speculators. Although our argument apparently is somewhat diﬀerent, the
rather similar eﬀect described here may have a common origin: large excep-
tional ﬂuctuations in the short-term returns of the underlying perhaps can be
traced to speculation. The asymptotic power law fall-oﬀ of the return distri-
bution Eq. (34) has indeed recently12 been linked to the speculative actions of
large investors such as mutual funds.

It is diﬃcult to compare a risk due to exceptionally large ﬂuctuations to
any risk arising from ”normal” ﬂuctuations described by the variance of a
distribution. How this exceptional risk is valued furthermore depends on the
perception of investors. The function α(x, v) thus probably is speciﬁed only by
the observed option prices themselves. In the absence of options to every strike

f The interpretation of α as an eﬀective cost of carry makes this mathematical statement
rather obvious: nobody will hold an asset whose cost of carry grows faster than its return.
gThe mean drift α(n, v) in Eq. (50) should not be confused with the mean return of the
asset. The two are not even related: the drift α(n, v) is due to large ﬂuctuations in the price
of the underlying, not due to its mean return. The stochastic process Eq. (49) is not the one
followed by the log-price x(v) of the asset.

15

and exercise date, the problem of calibrating α(x, v) to the observed market
prices is not complete. Additional assumptions are required – for instance that
the relative entropy to the Black-Scholes model is minimal13.

To better visualize the eﬀect a non-vanishing drift has on option prices,
let us consider constant α > 0. One can explicitly solve Eq. (45) in this case
and obtains that the overall Black-Scholes variance vBS(˜k, α; vf ) at expiration
implied by a European call is implicitly given by the relation,

ln(vBS/vf ) +

(˜k + vBS/2)2

(51)

A typical implied total variance surface for constant α

0 is shown
in Fig. 1. For α = 0 Eq. (45) reduces to the Black-Scholes equation and
vBS(˜k, α = 0; vf ) = vf . In the Black-Scholes world with α = 0 there is no
volatility-skew if one conditions on the total variance vf of the returns on ex-
piry of the European-style options. As α increases the variance implied by deep
in-the-money calls becomes progressively greater compared to the one implied

≥

16

by out-of-the-money calls. This behavior can be understood by interpreting α
as an eﬀective cost-of-carry for the underlying asset in the Black-Scholes world
– this cost evidently is avoided by holding a deep in-the-money call instead of
the asset itself and is incurred when holding a deep in-the-money put. The
same reasoning also implies that for α > 0 in-the-money calls should become
more undervalued by the Black-Scholes model as the time to expiration (and
thus vf ) increases. The simple model with constant α thus tends to quali-
tatively reproduce the volatility smile and term structure that is generically
observed for equities. The fact that the total variance vf of the returns at the
expiry of the option is itself uncertain has to be taken into account in a real-
istic valuation. It does not qualitatively change the picture if the risk-neutral
uncertainty of vf is not too great. A more richly structured variance surface
can be modelled by non-constant α(x, v).

4 A Summary and Discussion of the Results

We separated the problem of valuing European-style options from that of con-
structing a risk-free portfolio by conditioning on the overall variance of the
asset’s returns when the option expires. For hedging purposes, assets with
sub-exponential short-term return distributions can be divided into those with
ﬁnite and inﬁnite variance (classes II and III respectively). Most ﬁnancially
interesting assets historically1,6,7 belong to class II. Fully dynamic portfolios
that are risk-free can be constructed for any asset with short-term returns of
ﬁnite variance and in particular for class II assets. However, in contrast to
the Black-Scholes world, a risk-free portfolio in this case has to be statically
immunized against exceptionally large ﬂuctuations of the asset’s returns. In
eﬀect this implies that the portfolio’s variation in value must be bounded. It
therefore contains at least two diﬀerent European-style options on the asset.

We use the variance overall v of the returns on the underlying instead of
a ”trading time”. The ﬁnal overall variance vf when the European-style op-
tion expires is interpreted as a stochastic ”stopping time” for the risk-neutral
diﬀusion. The diﬀusion for the fair price of an option on a class II asset was
found to be characterized by a drift α(x, v). Constant α > 0 for given vf qual-
itatively reproduces the volatility smile and term-structure often observed in
equity markets. For short-term return distributions that fall oﬀ exponentially
or faster, α = 0 and the diﬀusion reduces to the one of Black-Scholes, albeit
evolving in v instead of in a trading time.

One might object to considering sub-exponential return distributions for
the underlying, since the price variations of an asset, although perhaps large,
can be thought of as restricted to a ﬁnite range in the ﬁnite lifespan of the

17

option. There are at least two objections to this argument. Firstly, the value
of equities does sometimes change considerably in a short time and ﬂuctua-
tions may exceed several standard deviations when a company is forced into
bankruptcy or announces new patents or acquisitions. These scenarios are not
so rare that they can be disregarded in the valuation of options (except per-
haps by insiders). One realistically therefore may wish to immunize a portfolio
against large price-changes of the underlying. It also is operationally and ﬁnan-
cially quite impossible to balance a portfolio arbitrarily often. If the tails of the
return distribution are suﬃciently fat, higher moments can become relevant in
the evaluation of Eq. (17) when the change in variance, h, between updates
is ﬁnite. If higher moments of the distribution of returns are suﬃciently large
(not necessarily inﬁnite) it again is advisable to immunize the portfolio against
large price ﬂuctuations of the underlying asset, that is restrict the portfolio’s
variation in value under large variations of the asset’s price. The same strategy
was found to be useful in pricing options on class II assets: the portfolio in this
case should be statically immunized against exceptionally large ﬂuctuations of
the underlying and dynamically hedged to make it insensitive to normal ones
as well.

Thus, although it may in reality not be possible to distinguish sharply
between assets of class I and II, the strategy employed here for class II assets
is the more realistic one. The processes for the two kinds of assets evidently
can be continuously deformed into each other and it is gratifying that the
evolution equations satisﬁed by the corresponding option prices also can be
continuously deformed from α(x, v)

= 0 (class II) to α(x, v) = 0 (class I).

The returns on ﬁnancial assets in realistic markets fortunately have ﬁ-
nite variance and the Paretian (class III) scenario therefore is quite academic.
The risk-free measure for the valuation of European-style options conditional
on the ﬁnal variance of the asset’s returns is unique for class I assets. The
volatility smile and term structure in this case are entirely due to the risk-
free distribution of the ﬁnal (stopping) variance. An a priori unspeciﬁed drift
function α(x, v) complicates the valuation of European-style options on class II
assets. By Eq. (46) α(x, v) is given by the ”Greeks” of an option and eﬀectively
measures the amount by which option prices at any moment violate the Black-
Scholes pde. We have interpreted α(x, v) as the investor’s compensation for
the residual risk of a single-option Delta-hedged portfolio due to exceptionally
large ﬂuctuations in the asset’s returns. As such, this drift is not explicitly re-
lated to the process for the underlying. However, quite interestingly, the eﬀect
of this drift on option valuation is equivalent to that of an eﬀective cost-of-carry
for the underlying asset in the Black-Scholes world.

A Estimates of the Remainders

To justify the estimates in the text we here show that the remainders in the
expansions (21) and (41) indeed are negligible as h

0+.

We ﬁrst consider a pdf ph(x) of class I with variance h and vanishing
mean. The argument of ph can always be shifted to obtain a distribution with
non-vanishing mean. Being in class I implies that,

that is, the moment generating function is analytic about λ = 0 and all mo-
ments of ph(y), in particular, are ﬁnite.

pdf,

(57)

are ﬁnite. Using that f (N +1)(x) is analytic about x = 0, the integral in Eq. (56)
0+ and one concludes that,
has a ﬁnite limit for h
Eph [RN ] = O(h(N +1)/2) .

(58)

→

This estimate continues to hold when the function f (x) is expanded about
a point x = µ(h) that satisﬁes Eq. (13). For analytic portfolio values, the
estimates in Eqs. (22) and (30) thus are justiﬁed and the neglected terms are
of higher order in h.

The valuation of bounded portfolios with pdf’s of class II such as Eq. (34)
can be reduced to the previous case if the error from truncating the pdf becomes
negligible for h
0+. To see this, consider a pdf with zero mean and variance
h that for suﬃciently small h is bounded by,

→

ph(y)

ν

D
√h (cid:18)

h

|

> 1, h < h0 ,

(59)

where D > 0 and ν are constants that do not depend on h. Note that if the
variance of ph(y) is ﬁnite, Eq. (59) holds for some ν > 3/2. The contribution of
the tails of the distribution to the expectation of a bounded function
fmax in this case is,

The tails of any distribution in class II (with ν > 3/2) therefore give a sub-
leading contribution to the expectation of a bounded function and can be cut
oﬀ. For bounded functions, a pdf of class II eﬀectively can be replaced by
one that vanishes for
> 1. This pdf of class II with truncated tails is a
pdf of class I up to a normalization factor. Using Eq. (60) with f (y) = 1,
the normalization correction is of order hν−1/2 and is itself sub-leading. The
estimate of the expectation of bounded functions for pdf’s of class II thus is
reduced to the previous case of class I distributions. [Note that ν = 2 for the
realistic pdf of Eq. (34) – the error induced by cutting oﬀ the tails in this case
is of the same order as that due to neglecting the remainder in the expansion
of the portfolio’s value.] For short-term returns with a ﬁnite variance, the
estimate of the order of the corrections in Eq. (42) thus is justiﬁed for portfolios
with bounded values and a distribution of the returns on the asset that falls
oﬀ like Eq. (34).

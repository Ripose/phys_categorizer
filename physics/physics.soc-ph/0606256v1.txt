Many real networks are embedded in a metric space: the interactions among individuals depend on their
spatial distances and usually take place among their nearest neighbors. In this paper, we introduce a modiﬁed
susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model to study geographical effects on the spread of diseases by assuming
that the probability of a healthy individual infected by an infectious one is inversely proportional to the Euclidean
distance between them. It is found that geography plays a more important role than hubs in disease spreading:
the more geographically constrained the network is, the more highly the epidemic prevails.

Accurately modelling epidemic spreading is an important
topic in understanding the impact of diseases and the develop-
ment of effective strategies for their control and containment
[1]. The classical mathematical approach for describing dis-
ease spreading either ignores the population structure or treats
population as distributed in a uniform medium. However, it
has been argued in the past few years that many social, bi-
ological, and communication systems possess two universal
characters, the small-world effect [2] and the scale-free prop-
erty [3], which can be described by complex networks whose
nodes represent individuals and links represent the interac-
tions among them [4]. In view of the wide occurrence of com-
plex networks in nature, it is interesting to study the effects of
topological structures on the dynamics of epidemic spread-
ing. Pioneering works [5, 6, 7, 8, 9] have given some valuable
insights: for homogeneous networks (e.g., regular, random,
and small-world networks), there are critical thresholds of the
spreading rate below which infectious diseases will eventually
die out; on the contrary, even infections with low spreading
rates will prevail over the entire population in heterogeneous
networks (e.g., scale-free networks). This radically changes
many conclusions drawn from classic epidemic modelling.
Furthermore, it has been observed that the heterogeneity of
a population network in which the disease spreads may have
noticeable effects on the evolution of the epidemic as well as
the corresponding immunization strategies [8, 9, 10, 11].

In many real networks, however, individuals are often em-
bedded in a Euclidean geographical space and the interac-
tions among them usually depend on their spatial distances
and take place among their nearest neighbors [12, 13, 14, 15].
For instance, the number of long-range links and the num-
ber of edges connected to a single node are limited by the
spatial embedding, particularly in planar networks. Also,
it has been proved that the characteristic distance plays a
crucial role in the dynamics taking place on these networks
[16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. Thus, it is natural to study complex
networks with geographical properties. Rozenfeld et al. con-

N = 10000 for γ = 2.5 and 3.5. The territory parameter A controls
the inﬂuence of the geographical distance on the network structure.

sidered that the spatial distance can affect the connection be-
tween nodes and proposed a lattice-embedded scale-free net-
work (LESFN) model [17]. Based on a natural principle of
minimizing the total length of links in the system, a scale-free
network can be embedded in a Euclidean space. Since dis-
tributions of individuals in social networks always depend on
their spatial locations, the study of the inﬂuence of geograph-
ical structures on dynamical processes is of great importance.
In this paper, we present a modiﬁed Susceptible-Infected-
Susceptible (SIS) model on the LESFN to investigate how the
geographical structure affects the dynamical process of epi-
demic spreading. Here, we assume that the time scales gov-
erning the dynamics is much smaller than those characterizing
the network evolvement. Thus, the static network is suitable
to use for discussing the problem under investigation. In con-
trast to the assumption that the infection probability is identi-
cal across successive contacts, we deﬁne the probability of a
healthy individual i infected by an infectious one j to be in-
versely proportional to the Euclidean distance between them.
Based on computer simulations, we found that when the net-
work connectivity is less local, it will be more robust to dis-
ease spreading, regardless of the heterogeneous distribution of
nodes.

The LESFN is generated as follows [17, 18]: (i) a lattice
of size N = L × L with periodic boundary conditions is as-
sumed, upon which the network will be embedded; (ii) for
each site of the lattice, a preset degree k is assigned taken
from a scale-free distribution, P (k) ∼ k−γ, m < k < K;
(iii) a node (say i, with degree ki) is picked randomly and
connected to its closest neighbors, until its degree quotum ki
is realized or until all sites up to a distance have been explored

d(ki) = Apki,

(1)

Duplicate connections are prohibited. Here, d(ki) is the spa-
tial distance on a Euclidean plane denoting the characteristic
radius of the region that node i can almost freely to reach the
others; (iv) this process is repeated throughout all the sites on
the lattice. Following this method, networks with γ > 2 can
be successfully embedded up to a (Euclidean) distance d(k)
which can be made as large as desired upon the change of the
territory parameter A. The model turns out to be a randomly
connected scale-free network when A → ∞ [22]. Typical
networks with γ = 2.5 and 3.5 resulting from the embedding
method are illustrated in Fig. 1. In the case of N = 10000, the
power-low degree distributions of the LESFNs achieve their
natural cutoff lengths for A = 2, 3 and 9, while they end at
some ﬁnite-size cutoff lengths for A = 1.

In order to study geographical effects on the spread of dis-
eases, we introduce a modiﬁed SIS model. In this model, an
individual is described by a single dynamical variable adopt-
ing one of the two stages: susceptible and infected. Consider-
ing the geography, we assume that the probability of a healthy
individual i infected by an infectious one j is inversely pro-
portional to the Euclidean distance between them, deﬁned by

λij =

dα

,

(2)

where α is a tunable parameter. This is motivated by the
following idea: human beings are located in territories and
they interact more frequently with their nearest neighbors than
those far away. The transmission of a disease is described in
an effective way with the following rules: a susceptible indi-
vidual at time t will pass to the infected state with the rate λ at
time t + 1 if he is connected to infected individuals. Infected
individuals at time t will pass to the susceptible state again
with the unite rate at time t + 1. Individuals run randomly
through the cycle, susceptible → infected → susceptible.

In the present work, we have performed Monte-Carlo (MC)
simulations of the model with synchronously updating on the
network. Initially, the number of infected nodes is 1% of the
size of the network. The total sampling times are 10000 (MC
time steps). After appropriate relaxation times, the systems is
stabilized to a steady state. Simulations were implemented on
the network model averaging over 500 different realizations.
Given a network, an important observable is the prevalence ρ,
which is the time average of the fraction of infected individu-
als in the steady state (averaging over 1000 time steps in this
context).

Figure 2 shows the persistence of infected individuals ρ ver-
sus the scale-free degree exponent γ for the LESFNs with dif-
ferent values of A when α is ﬁxed at 2. As γ increases, all
the curves approach to an asymptotic value of ρ = 0.5, inde-
pendent of the geography of networks. The larger the param-
eter A, the quicker the prevalence ρ is close to the asymptotic
value. This implies that the scale-free degree exponent has
a slight inﬂuence on the spread of diseases when networks
are more geographical constrained (smaller A) in comparison
with the case of more scale-free region (larger A). It has been
suggested [23] that there is a threshold γc = 3 which separates
the two different dynamical behaviors of disease spreading, so
we will focus on the values of γ at 2.5 and 3.5, respectively,
to study two typical cases.

In Fig. 3, we plot the densities of infected individuals ρ
versus the tunable parameter α for the LESFNs with γ = 2.5
and 3.5, respectively. As α becomes larger, the prevalence ρ

decreases, and all the curves approach to stable values ﬁnally.
The solid lines ﬁts to the form ρ = B0 + Be−α/α0, implying
that there is a relation of the ﬁrst-order exponential decay be-
tween ρ and α. According to the deﬁnition of the spreading
probability of our model (see Eq. (2)), one can easily ﬁnd that
the larger the parameter α, the smaller the spreading rate λ is.
This results in a small fraction of infected nodes in the net-
work. In order to understand how the geographical structure
affects the epidemic dynamics, we plot the prevalence ρ as a
function of the territory parameter A in Fig. 4. It shows that
as A increases, the density ρ deceases. In other words, when

networks are more geographically constrained, i.e., more lo-
cally interconnected, they tend to have larger epidemic preva-
lence. This is different from the results observed on Barab´asi-
Albert scale-free networks, where nodes with large degrees
(called “hubs”) accelerate the spreading process and induce
signiﬁcant epidemic prevalence. The solid line ﬁts to the form
ρ = C0 + Ce−A/A0 . Similar to Fig. 3, there is also a relation
of the ﬁrst-order exponential decay between ρ and A.

We also provide an illustration for the behavior of the prob-
ability ρk that a node with given connectivity k is infected.
The range of an edge is the length of the shortest paths be-
tween the nodes it connected in the absence of itself [24, 25].
If an edge’s range is l, the shortest cycle it lies on is of length
l + 1. Thus the distribution of range in a network sketches
the distribution of shortest cycles. It has been demonstrated
numerically that when the spatial constraint is stronger, the
LESFN has more small-order cycles [21]. In this case, the
nodes are more likely to meet which speeds disease spread-
ing. As shown in Fig. 5, in the case of γ = 2.5, there is a
heterogeneous behavior of ρk, especially for A = 9, i.e., the
higher a node degree, the larger the probability ρk. However,
when a node’s degree is larger than a certain value, this fea-
ture vanishes. This implies that even a geographical network
tends to a scale-free random graph, where the hub effect on
the spreading dynamics is still limited, i.e., a node’s potential
infectivity is not strictly equal to its degree due to geograph-
ical effects. This effect is more stronger for γ = 3.5, that is,
all the curves are nearly linearly independent of the value of
the territory parameter.

In conclusion, we have studied geographical effects on
the spreading phenomena in lattice-embedded scale-free net-
works, in which a territory parameter A controls the inﬂuence
of the geography on the network structure and therefore on
the epidemic dynamics. We studied the modiﬁed SIS model
in which the probability of a healthy individual infected by
an infectious one is inversely proportional to the Euclidean
distance between them. Our main ﬁnding is that when the
network is more geographically constrained, i.e., with heavier
local connections, the epidemic prevalence will be more sig-
niﬁcant. This indicates that networks with more local connec-
tions have a higher risk to disease spreading. On the contrary,
while the network is more scale-free, it will be more robust to
disease spreading, regardless of the heterogeneous connectiv-
ity of the network.

Abstract

We investigate the networks of committee and subcommittee assign-

ments in the United States House of Representatives from the 101st–108th

Congresses, with committees connected according to “interlocks” or com-

mon membership. We examine the House’s community structure using

several methods, which reveal strong links between diﬀerent committees

as well as the intrinsic hierarchical structure within the House as a whole.

We identify structural changes, including additional hierarchical levels and

higher modularity, resulting from the 1994 elections, in which the Repub-

lican party earned majority status in the House for the ﬁrst time in more

than forty years. We also combine our network approach with analysis of

roll call votes using singular value decomposition to uncover correlations

between the political and organizational structure of House committees.

1 Introduction

Much of the detailed work in making United States law is performed by Con-

gressional committees and subcommittees. This contrasts with parliamentary

democracies such as Great Britain and Canada, where a larger part of the leg-

islative process is directly in the hands of political parties or is conducted in

sessions of the entire parliament. While the legislation drafted by committees

in the U.S. Congress is subject ultimately to roll call votes by the full Senate

and House of Representatives, the important role played by committees and

subcommittees makes the study of their formation and composition vital to

understanding the work of the American legislature.

The presence of committees in the House endows it with obvious hierarchi-

cal levels: individual Representatives, subcommittees, standing committees, and

the entire House ﬂoor. It is desirable to examine this structure quantitatively to

determine whether the House has any additional structure that might relate to

collaborative eﬀorts among Representatives, such as correlations or close asso-

ciations between the memberships of diﬀerent committees. The importance of

such studies is not merely academic; an understanding of the House as a collab-

oration network may shed considerable light on the law-making process, as bills

typically spend time in multiple committees and subcommittees while being

drafted in preparation for a vote on the House ﬂoor. For instance, the House’s

consideration of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 involved the Committee

on Education and the Workforce, the Subcommittee on Education Reform, the

Subcommittee on 21st Century Competitiveness, the Committee on the Judi-

ciary, and the Committee on Rules (setting the terms for the scrutiny of the

bill) before being approved by the full House (The Library of Congress, 2004).

After the Senate further amended the bill, a conference agreement eventually

passed both houses of Congress, and the ﬁnal bill was signed by the President

to become public law No. 107–110.

Analyzing the structure of the committee system in the House of Represen-

tatives and studying its correlation with the partisanship of its constituent Rep-

3

resentatives aids the understanding of political party competition in Congress.

Several contrasting theories of committee assignment have been developed in the

political science literature (mostly through qualitative studies, although there

have been some quantitative ones; see, e.g., Niskanen, 1971; Gilligan & Krehbiel,

1987; Krehbiel, 1990; Cox & McCubbins, 1993; Shepsle & Weingast, 1995; Boyce & Bischak,

2002), but there is no consensus explanation of how committee assignments

are initially determined or how they are modiﬁed from one two-year term of

Congress to the next. A question of particular interest is whether political par-

ties assign committee memberships essentially at random or if, for instance, the

more inﬂuential Congressional committees can be seen using objective analysis

to be “stacked” with partisan party members.

As we show here, network methods are particularly eﬀective at uncovering

structure among committee and subcommittee assignments without the need

to incorporate any speciﬁc knowledge about committee members or their po-

litical positions.

In a recent article (Porter et al., 2005), the present authors

formulated and brieﬂy examined the committee assignment networks discussed

in detail in this work, looking for instance at the partisanship of the Select Com-

mittee on Homeland Security in the 107th House and its connections to other

committees. An alternative network perspective on the structure of Congress

has been oﬀered by Fowler (2006a,b), who examined the network deﬁned by the

cosponsorhip of legislation by members of Congress. In the present work, we

compare our previous observations to those for the 108th House and explore the

structural changes in the networks that resulted from the 1994 Congressional

elections in which the Republican party gained majority control of the House.

A detailed technical discussion of the methods used to obtain our results is

included in the appendices.

There is already a considerable body of literature on other collaboration

networks, such as those determined by the membership of boards of directors of

corporations (Mariolis, 1975; Useem, 1984; Mintz & Schwartz, 1985; Mizruchi,

1996; Robins & Alexander, 2004). Boards of directors occupy a position in the

business world somewhat analogous to that occupied by committees in Congress.

4

It has been shown that board memberships play a major role in the spread of

attitudes, ideas, and practices through the corporate world, aﬀecting investment

strategies (Haunschild, 1993), political donations (Useem, 1984), and even the

stock market on which a company is listed (Rao et al., 2000). Studies of the

structure of corporate networks have shed considerable light on the mechanisms

and pathways of information diﬀusion (Davis et al., 2003; Burt, 2004, 2005),

and it seems plausible that the structure of congressional committees will be

similarly revealing.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. First, we deﬁne the bi-

partite collaboration networks determined by the assignments of Representatives

to House committees and subcommittees. We then investigate the hierarchical

structure of these networks using several diﬀerent methods for community iden-

tiﬁcation. We also incorporate singular value decomposition (SVD) analyses of

the House roll call votes into our study of the House’s community structure. As

examples, we examine connections between the Rules Committee and the Select

Committee on Homeland Security in the 107th and 108th Houses and investigate

structural changes in the networks that resulted from the 1994 Congressional

elections. Additional details are provided in two appendices:

in Appendix A,

we explain the methods used in our SVD analysis of voting patterns; in Ap-

pendix B, we give a detailed comparison of several methods for community

detection in networks, including a generalization of a recently proposed local

detection algorithm (Bagrow & Bollt, 2005) to weighted networks.

2 Committee assignment networks in the House

We represent each of the 101st–108th U.S. House of Representatives as a bipar-

tite (two-mode) network based on assignments of Representatives to commit-

tees and subcommittees (henceforth called just “committees” for simplicity).

The two types of nodes in these networks correspond to Representatives and

committees, with edges connecting each Representative to the committees on

which he or she sits. The period we study (1989–2004) spans the political

5

changes following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 (Kaniewski, 2002;

The Library of Congress, 2004), as well as the 1994 elections in which the Re-

publican party won majority control of the House for the ﬁrst time in more

than forty years. We construct one network for each two-year Congressional

term from data published by the Clerk’s Oﬃce of the House of Representatives

(Trandahl, 2004), ignoring changes in committee assignments associated with

midterm changes in the House.

Each network includes roughly 440 Representatives (including non-voting

Delegates and midterm replacements), about 20 standing committees, and more

than 100 subcommittees, with an average of about 6 committee assignments

per Representative. Because of the relatively high edge density (about 5%

of possible connections are present), we have found some frequently studied

network statistics, such as geodesic path lengths, to be unrevealing in this case.

Therefore, we have instead focused our attention on the hierarchical structure in

the networks and associated measures such as modularity and Horton-Strahler

numbers. We discuss this analysis in Section 3.

With data for eight consecutive Congresses, it is natural to ask how the com-

mittee assignment network changes in time. One question of interest is whether

our networks contain signs of the so-called “Republican Revolution” of 1994

that ended forty years of Democratic majorities in the House of Representa-

tives, the longest span of single-party rule in Congressional history (Klinkner,

1996). That is, can one observe structural diﬀerences in the committee as-

signment networks between the Democrat-majority Houses (101st–103rd) and

the Republican-majority ones (104th–108th)? As one means of addressing

this question, we compute the degree of each node, deﬁned as the number of

edges connected to it. Because the House committee assignment networks are

bipartite, we construct two types of cumulative (integrated) degree distribu-

tions (Newman et al., 2001) and examine how they changed across Congresses.

One distribution (Fig. 1a) indicates the number of committees on which each

Representative sits, and the other (Fig. 1b) gives the number of Representa-

tives on each committee. We do not observe a large trend in Democrat-majority

6

Houses, although a slow increase in committee sizes is revealed in panel (b). The

committee reorganization that accompanied the formation of the Republican-

majority 104th House produced a sharp decline in the typical numbers of com-

mittee and subcommittee assignments per Representative, but the trend in sub-

sequent Republican-majority terms of Congress has been a slow increase in both

the numbers of assignments and the committee sizes. These trends are visible

in Fig. 1.

While rich in their data content, the two-mode networks of committee assign-

ments are diﬃcult to visualize and interpret. A common strategy in such cases

is to examine instead a one-mode “projection” of the network onto either the

committees or the Representatives. In our studies, we have made considerable

use of the projection onto the committees, in which a network is created whose

nodes represent the committees and whose edges represent common membership

or “interlocks” between committees. Figures 2 and 3 show two diﬀerent visual-

izations of this network of committees for the 107th House of Representatives

(2001–2002), an example that we analyze in some depth below.

We quantify the strength of the connection between committees in this pro-

jected network with a normalized interlock, deﬁned as the number of common

members two committees have divided by the expected number of common

members if committees of the same size were randomly and independently as-

signed from the members of the House. Committees with as many common

members as expected by chance have normalized interlock 1, those with twice

as many have interlock 2, those with none have interlock 0, and so forth. We

use this weighting to visualize the network of the 107th House in Fig. 2. For

comparison, we use the raw (unnormalized) interlock count of common members

for the weights in the visualization in Fig. 3. In Fig. 4, we visualize the 108th

House using normalized interlock.

Some of the connections depicted in Figs. 2–4 are expected and unsurprising.

For instance, sets of subcommittees of the same standing committee share many

of the same members, thereby forming a group or clique in the network. The

four subcommittees of the 107th Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence,

7

for example, each include at least half of the full 20-member committee and

at least one third of each of the other subcommittees. These tight connections

result in normalized interlocks with values in the range 14.4–23.6, causing these

ﬁve nodes to be drawn close together in the visualizations, forming a small

pentagon, shown in the middle right of Fig. 2 and lower right of Fig. 3. The

Intelligence Committee and its subcommittees are also tightly connected in the

108th House, appearing again as a small pentagon in Fig. 4.

We also ﬁnd more surprising connections between committees. For instance,

the 9-member Select Committee on Homeland Security, formed in June 2002

during the 107th Congress in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September

11, 2001 (Kaniewski, 2002), is observed to have a strong connection to the 13-

member Rules Committee (with a normalized interlock of 7.4 from two common

members), which is the committee charged with deciding the rules and order of

business under which legislation is considered by other committees and the full

House (The Library of Congress, 2004). The Homeland Security Committee is

also connected to the 7-member Legislative and Budget Process Subcommittee

of Rules by the same two common members (with normalized interlock 13.7).

In the 108th Congress (see Fig. 4), the Homeland Security Committee swelled

to 50 members but maintained a close association with the Rules Committee

(with a normalized interlock of 4.1 from 6 common members).

3 The hierarchical structure of committees

We now turn to an examination of hierarchical structure in the networks of

committees, based on the one-mode projection described above. We use the hi-

erarchical clustering method known as single linkage clustering (Johnson, 1967);

we discuss some alternative community detection methods in Appendix B.

Starting with the complete set of committees for a given Congress, commit-

tees are joined together sequentially starting with the pair with the greatest

normalized interlock, followed by the next greatest, and so forth. This process

generates “clusters” of committees, which can be represented using a tree or

8

dendrogram, such as that shown in Fig. 5 for the 107th House. There appear

to be essentially four hierarchical levels of clustering within this dendrogram:

subcommittees, committees, groups of committees, and ﬁnally the entire House.

There is also some indication of a weaker ﬁfth level of organization correspond-

ing to groups of subcommittees inside larger standing committees.

Here we are primarily interested in the third level—the connections between

committees. For example, we see near the 8 o’clock position in Fig. 5 a tightly

grouped cluster that includes the House Rules Committee and the Select Com-

mittee on Homeland Security. Because assignments to select committees are

ordinarily determined by drawing selectively from legislative bodies with over-

lapping jurisdiction, one might naively expect a close connection between the

Select Committee on Homeland Security and, for example, the Terrorism and

Homeland Security Subcommittee of the Intelligence Select Committee, which

was formed originally as a bipartisan “working group” and was designated on

September 13, 2001 by House Speaker Dennis Hastert [R-IL] as the lead con-

gressional entity assigned to investigate the 9/11 terrorist attacks (Kaniewski,

2002). However, the 107th Homeland Security Committee shares only one com-

mon member (normalized interlock 2.4) with the Intelligence Select Committee

(located near the 1 o’clock position in Fig. 5) and has no interlock at all with

any of the four Intelligence subcommittees.

Figure 5 adds a further level of sophistication to the analysis by color-coding

each committee according to the mean “extremism” of its members. Extremism

is determined using the results of an SVD analysis of Representatives’ voting

records, placing each Representative on a scale that runs, roughly speaking,

from the most partisan Republican members of the House to the most par-

tisan Democrats. (The SVD analysis is described in detail in Appendix A.)

The extremism of a committee is then quantiﬁed as the average deviation of its

members from the mean on this scale. Committees that are determined to be

composed of highly partisan members of either party appear in red in Fig. 5

and those containing more moderate Representatives appear in blue. Taking

again the examples of Intelligence and Homeland Security, we can immediately

9

identify the former as moderate and the latter as more partisan. Indeed, the

Select Committee on Homeland Security has a larger mean extremism than

any of the 19 standing Committees and has the 4th largest mean extremism

among the 113 committees of the 107th House (see Table 1). This is perhaps

not so surprising when we see that its members included the House Majority

Leader, Richard Armey [R-TX], and both the Majority and Minority Whips,

Tom DeLay [R-TX] and Nancy Pelosi [D-CA]. However, this characterization of

the committee was made mathematically, using no political knowledge beyond

the roll call votes of the 107th House. As another example, the 107th House

Rules Committee is the 2nd most extreme of the 19 standing committees (after

Judiciary) and ranks 18th out of 113 committees overall. In contrast, the Per-

manent Select Committee on Intelligence of the 107th House has a smaller mean

extremism than each of the 19 standing Committees, and Intelligence and its

four subcommittees all rank among the 10 least extreme of all 113 committees.

4 Modularity

To further explore the observed hierarchies in the House committee assignment

networks, we employ the statistic known as modularity, modiﬁed to allow for

the weighted nature of our networks. Consider ﬁrst an unweighted network,

which is divided into some number of groups of vertices. The modularity m for

this division into groups is deﬁned to be (Newman, 2004)

m = X
i

(eii −

a2
i ) ,

(1)

where eij denotes the fraction of ends of edges in group i for which the other

end of the edge lies in group j, and ai = Pj eij is the fraction of all ends of
edges that lie in group i. Modularity measures the diﬀerence between the total

fraction of edges that fall within—rather than between—groups (the ﬁrst term)

and the fraction one would expect if edges were placed at random (respecting

vertex degrees). Thus, high values of the modularity indicate divisions of the

network in which more of the edges fall within groups than one would expect by

11

chance. This indicates a strong or signiﬁcant split in the network and has been

found to be a good indicator of functional network divisions in many cases.

Here we consider a simple generalization of the modularity to our weighted

networks, in which instead of counting numbers of edges falling between partic-

ular groups, we count the sums of the weights of those edges, so that heavily

weighted edges contribute more than lightly weighted ones. Both eij and ai can

be generalized in this fashion in a straightforward manner, and then the modu-

larity is again calculated from Eq. (1). The meaning of the modularity remains

essentially the same: it measures when a particular division of the network has

more edge weight within groups than one would expect on the basis of chance.

We use modularity to quantify our hierarchical division of the networks

and to compare hierarchies to each other. In particular, the modularity val-

ues shown in Table 2 indicate that the dendrograms produced via single linkage

clustering have a better-deﬁned community structure (higher modularity) in the

Republican-controlled Houses (104th–108th) than in the Democrat-controlled

ones. Hence, with respect to the metric of normalized interlock, the committee

reorganization following the Republican Revolution (which we already saw in

Fig. 1a produced a sharp decline in the typical numbers of committee assign-

ments per Representative compared to the 101st–103rd Houses), seems to have

tightened the compartmentalization of the House committee assignments.

5 Number of hierarchical levels

While modularity is useful for measuring the strength of the community organi-

zation in the House dendrograms, another interesting feature of dendrograms is

the depth of their hierarchical organization, which can be quantiﬁed by comput-

ing Horton-Strahler (S) numbers (Horton, 1945; Strahler, 1952; da Costa et al.,

2002; Arenas et al., 2003). Horton-Strahler numbers indicate the number of

levels in the minimum-depth branch of a tree. Here we also consider a gener-

alization of Strahler numbers, assigning a value Sj that identiﬁes the number

of hierarchical levels associated with the jth subcommittee. In Table 7 of Ap-

of Bagrow & Bollt (2005) to weighted networks (WL). These last three algo-

rithms are described in Appendix B. For the WL method, we use the value of

tion method to quantify the statistics of the hierarchical levels revealed by each

method.

As indicated previously, single linkage clustering clearly identiﬁes several hi-

erarchical levels of organization within the House of Representatives: subcom-

mittees, committees, and the ﬂoor (the whole House). In all eight Houses, we

also identify a fourth hierarchical level, representing groups of closely-connected

committees. In the 104th, 105th, 107th, and 108th Houses, single linkage clus-

tering reveals a ﬁfth level of organization. See, for example, Fig. 6, which is

color-coded according to the Sj values of the leaves/committees, and Fig. 7,

which is color-coded according to the Horton-Strahler S values of the communi-

ties computed as if each community were itself an individual tree. Single linkage

clustering appears to organize the House’s hierarchical structure more sharply

than betweenness-based dendrograms, as the trees produced by the former have
consistently higher values of S and ˜S. Additionally, networks with high max-

imum and average Strahler numbers tend also to have high modularity scores

(compare Tables 2 and 7).

Strahler numbers reveal additional information about the changes in the

House committee assignment networks after the Republican Revolution. The

three lowest mean Strahler values occur in the Democrat-majority Houses (101st–

103rd), despite the fact that the number of committees and subcommittees de-

creased after the Republicans gained control of the House (see Fig. 1). In a per-

fectly balanced binary tree, one would instead expect an increase in the Strahler

number when nodes are added. Furthermore, all the Republican-controlled

Houses except for the 106th have 5 levels of hierarchical structure rather than

the 4 revealed in the 101st–103rd Houses, so it seems that the change in majority

party added an extra level of hierarchical structure to the committee assignment

network.

6 Conclusions

We have applied methods from network theory, coupled with an SVD analysis

of roll call votes, to investigate the organizational structure of the committees

and subcommittees of the U.S. House of Representatives. Using the 101st–108th

Congresses as examples, we have found evidence of several levels of hierarchy

within the network of committees and—without incorporating any knowledge

of political events or positions—identiﬁed some close connections between com-

mittees, such as that between the House Rules Committee and the Select Com-

mittee on Homeland Security in the 107th and 108th Congresses. We have also

identiﬁed correlations between committee assignments and Representatives’ po-

litical positions and examined changes in the network structure across diﬀerent

Congresses, emphasizing eﬀects on the network properties that resulted from

the shift in majority party from Democrats to Republicans starting with the

104th House.

A Voting patterns

In this appendix we analyze the voting record of Representatives. The results

of this analysis were used in the main text to explore the relationship between

the network of interlocks linking the Congressional committees and the political

positions of their constituent Representatives.

One way to characterize political positions is to tabulate individuals’ vot-

ing records on selected key issues (e.g., via interest group ratings), but such

a method is subjective by nature and a method that involves less personal

judgment on the observer’s part is preferable. Here we use a singular value de-

composition (SVD) (Golub & Van Loan, 1996; Sirovich, 2003) of the complete

voting records of each House (Poole & Rosenthal, 1997, 2000). Other meth-

ods, such as the Bayesian approach of Clinton et al. (2004), can certainly be

used (Jakulin & Buntine, 2004; Pajala et al., 2004). Additionally, while chang-

ing political positions over time can be identiﬁed (Poole & Rosenthal, 1997;

15

Poole, 2005), we choose for simplicity to treat each Congressional term in iso-

lation from the others.

We deﬁne an n

m voting matrix B with one row for each of the n Rep-

×

resentatives in the House and one column for each of the m votes taken during

a two-year term in the House. For instance, the 107th House had n = 444

Representatives (including midterm replacements) and took m = 990 roll call

votes. The element Bij is +1 if Representative i voted “yea” on measure j

and

1 if he or she voted “nay.” If a Representative did not vote because of

−

absence or abstention, the corresponding element is 0. (We do not separately

identify deliberate abstentions from absences; also, a relatively low number of

false zeroes is generated by resignations and midterm replacements.)

The SVD identiﬁes groups of Representatives who voted in a similar fash-

ion on many measures. The grouping that has the largest mean-square overlap

with the actual groups voting for or against each measure is given by the leading
(normalized) eigenvector u(1) of the matrix BT B, the next largest by the second
eigenvector u(2), and so on (Golub & Van Loan, 1996; Sirovich, 2003). If we de-

note by σ2
k the corresponding eigenvalues (which are provably non-negative) and
by v(k) the normalized eigenvectors of BBT (which have the same eigenvalues),

then it can be shown that

To an excellent approximation, we ﬁnd that a Representative’s voting record

can be characterized by just two coordinates. That is, B(2)
ij

is a good approx-

imation to Bij. Noticing that one of the two directions correlates well with

stated political position, we call this the “partisan” coordinate. We call the

other direction the “bipartisan” coordinate, as it is correlated with how often a

Representative votes with the majority. Because Senators are generally better

known than Represenatives, we plot as an example the coordinates along these

ﬁrst two eigenvectors for the 107th Senate in Fig. 8. As expected, Democrats

are grouped together and are almost completely separated from Republicans.

For ease of identiﬁcation, we follow the sign convention that places Democrats

on the left and Republicans on the right. The few instances of apparent party

misidentiﬁcation by the partisan coordinate in Fig. 8 are unsurprising. Con-

servative Democrats, such as Zell Miller [D-GA], appear farther to the right

than some moderate Republicans (Boyce & Bischak, 2002). Additionally, Sen-

ator James Jeﬀords [I-VT] left the Republican party to become an Independent

early in the 107th Congress. (He appears twice in Fig. 8a as a result.) It is thus

unsurprising that the SVD analysis of his roll call votes puts him to the left of

several Democrats.

One can use a truncation of the SVD to reconstruct an approximation to

the votes in the full roll call (Sirovich, 2003). For instance, we can use our

two-dimensional approximation to the voting matrix and assign votes “yea” or

“nay” to individuals based on the signs of the corresponding elements of the

matrix. In Fig. 8b we show the fraction of actual votes correctly reconstructed

by this approximation, which gives a measure of the “predictability” of the

Senators in the 107th Congress. For both parties, moderate Senators are less

predictable than hard-liners. The two-dimensional projection correctly recon-

structs the votes of some hard-line Senators for as many as 97% of the votes

they cast. Looking at the apparent outliers in Fig. 8b, the votes Jeﬀords cast as

a Republican appear here to make him the least “predictable” Senator. How-

17

ever, it is important to emphasize that Jeﬀords cast relatively few votes as a

member of the Republican party, so it is not surprising that this behavior is less

predictable because the voting record includes a large number of artiﬁcial ab-

sences. The other Independent in Fig. 8b is Senator Dean Barkley [I-MN], who

completed the lame duck period of the 107th Congress for the deceased Paul

Wellstone [D-MN]. While one might be tempted to interpret Barkley’s partisan

coordinate as balanced, this value is strongly inﬂuenced by the large number

of eﬀective abstentions in the SVD analysis because he was not appointed until

very late in the term. Both of his ﬁrst two coordinates consequently lie near

zero. The other apparent outliers in Fig. 8b—Senators Russ Feingold [D-WI]

and John McCain [R-AZ]—are both known for their occasionally “maverick”

behavior.

Having demonstrated the application of SVD to the analysis of the voting

records of the Senate, let us now return to the House of Representatives as

the primary focus of this work. For the 107th House, we ﬁnd that the leading

eigenvector accounts for about 45.3% of the variance of the voting matrix, the

second eigenvector accounts for about 29.6%, and no other eigenvector accounts

for more than 1.6%. We obtain similar results for other recent Congresses, with

two eigenvectors giving a good approximation to the voting matrix in every

case (see Table 3).

In Fig. 9, we plot these two coordinates for every mem-

ber of the House of Representatives for each of the 102nd–107th Congresses.

It has been shown previously using other methods that Congressional voting

positions are well-approximated by just two coordinates (Poole & Rosenthal,

1997; Poole, 2005), but it is important to emphasize here that diﬀerent iden-

tiﬁcation methods treat the “bipartisan” direction diﬀerently.

In particular,

some methods eliminate it entirely and associate the two remaining dimensions

with partisanship and an additional direction identiﬁed as a North-South axis

which was historically important during periods of heightened concern about

civil rights (Poole & Rosenthal, 1997; Poole, 2005). The SVD analysis here

keeps the “bipartisan” coordinate, making identiﬁcations in a particularly sim-

ple fashion straight from the voting matrix containing the roll call data.

and the next six columns give the percentage of information encoded by each

of the six leading eigenvectors.

We ﬁnd that the leading eigenvector corresponds closely to the acknowledged

political party aﬃliation of the Representatives, with Democrats (blue) on the

left and Republicans (red) on the right in the plots.1 Representatives who score

highly on this “partisan” coordinate—either positively or negatively—tend often

to vote with members of their own party. From this coordinate, we also compute

a measure of “extremism” for each Representative as the absolute value of their

partisan coordinate relative to the mean partisan score of the full House. That

is, we deﬁne the extremism ei of a Representative by ei =

computed from the roll call) for the 107th House.

By contrast, the second eigenvector groups essentially all Representatives

together regardless of party aﬃliation and thus appears to represent voting

actions in which most members of the House either approve or disapprove of

a motion simultaneously. Representatives who score highly on this “bipartisan

The mean extremism for the Representatives in the 107th House is about

≃

≃

0.0458, and the standard deviation is σ

0.0090. The extremism of commit-

tees as averages over their constituent members yields a distribution of mean

0.0456 and standard deviation 0.0032. For comparison, one might crudely ex-

pect the standard deviation of the committees’ extremism to be approximately

σ/√N , where N is the average number of Representatives per committee. For

the 107th House, this gives 0.0090/√21.87

0.0019. Hence, the distribution

of committee extremism is roughly 50% wider than what would be expected

with independent committee assignments. Basic statistics concerning commit-

tee extremism for the 101st–107th Houses are summarized in Table 5. Observe,

for example, that the relative variance versus that expected from random com-

mittee and subcommittee assignments increases with every Congress (with the

largest increase occurring between the 106th and 107th Houses).

the sixth column gives how much larger the variance of committee extremism

opposed to the voters) along the same two leading dimensions to quantify the

nature of the issues being decided. We show this projection for the 107th House

in Fig. 10. One application of this analysis is a measurement of the repro-

ducibility of individual votes and outcomes. Reconstituting the voting matrix

as before using only the information contained in the two leading singular values

and the corresponding eigenvectors and summing the resulting approximated

votes over all Representatives, we derive a single score for each vote. Making

a simple assignment of “pass” to those votes that have a positive score and

“fail” to all others successfully reconstructs the outcome of 984 of the 990 to-

tal votes (i.e., about 99.4% of them). Overall, 735 (about 74.2%) of the votes

passed, so simply guessing that every vote passed would be considerably less

eﬀective. Ignoring values from known absences and abstentions (i.e., zeroes in

the original voting matrix), the analysis still identiﬁes 975 of the 990 results

correctly. Even with the most conservative measure of the reconstruction suc-

cess rate—in which we ignore values associated with abstentions and absences,

assign individual yeas or nays according to the sign of the matrix elements, and

then observe which outcome has a majority in the resulting roll call—the two-

dimensional reconstruction still identiﬁes 939 (about 94.8%) of the outcomes

correctly. We repeated these calculations for the 101st–106th Houses and found

similar results in each case (see Table 6). The remarkable accuracy of SVDs

in reconstructing votes was previously observed for U.S. Supreme Court cases

by Sirovich (2003). In comparison, the Optimal Classiﬁcation (OC) technique

of Poole & Rosenthal (2000) (see also Poole, 2005) also generates a rank order-

ing of the Representatives in the 107th House and correctly classiﬁes 92.8% of

the individual Representatives’ votes.

In making the connection between the voting record and the committee

assignment networks, we note that the committee assignment networks repre-

senting the 101st–107th Houses were constructed from documents obtained from

the website of the U.S. House of Representatives Oﬃce of the Clerk (Trandahl,

2004) and were based on the committee assignments at the end of each Congress.

Meanwhile, the roll calls include votes from Representatives who had since died

or resigned, and the networks include Representatives (such as Delegates) who

do not appear in the voting record. To combine network structure with polit-

ical spectra, it was thus necessary to reconcile the two data sets by removing

a few Representatives in each of these categories (about 10 from each roll call

and about 5–10 from each network). When we incorporated political spectra

into our network analysis, it was always with this slightly abridged data set.

The subsequent SVD computations experience little change as a result of these

changes.

B Community detection algorithms

The results in the main text of this paper make use of single linkage cluster-

ing to determine the hierarchical structure of the network of committees, but

several other community-detection methods can also be used (see, for example,

Girvan & Newman, 2002; Danon et al., 2005, and references therein). It is of

interest to ask whether our results are robust against changes in the method

employed. To address this question, we have explored three other methods—

two based on “betweenness” measures calculated on the full bipartite networks

of Representatives and committees and a local community detection algorithm

for weighted networks, generalized from the method for unweighted networks

introduced by Bagrow & Bollt (2005). As we now describe, we obtain simi-

lar groupings with these diﬀerent algorithms, although with some diﬀerences,

suggesting that the large-scale features, but perhaps not the details, observed

in our single-linkage clustering calculations are fundamental properties of the

networks and not a result of our choice of methodology.

B.1 Betweenness-based community detection

Communities can be detected in many cases using “betweenness” measures that

iteratively pick out and remove high-traﬃc edges (or other network compo-

nents) that lie on a large number of paths between vertices. Repeated applica-

24

tion of such a procedure eventually fragments a network into components, with

the entire process represented by dendrograms similar to those generated by

standard hierarchical clustering (Girvan & Newman, 2002; Newman & Girvan,

2003, 2004).

We have performed a corresponding calculation modiﬁed slightly to respect

the bipartite nature of the committee assignment networks, for which between-

ness can be computed by counting the number of shortest paths between pairs

of committees that traverse each edge in the network. Also, we compute be-

tweenness from densities of random walks between committees rather than

geodesics (see Newman, 2005), in part because the small diameter of the network

often leads to many non-unique geodesics. We use this betweenness measure in

two diﬀerent algorithms. In one, we sequentially remove those edges (i.e., com-

mittee assignments) with highest betweenness.

In the other, we sequentially

remove the nodes lying on the largest number of paths. Applying these two

methods to the full (unweighted) bipartite graphs avoids altogether the projec-

tion onto a one-mode network and the deﬁnition of the normalized interlock

used in the single-linkage clustering.

Comparing our diﬀerent community detection schemes, we see that the den-

drogram for the 107th House determined from random-walk betweenness and

edge removal (see Fig. 11) shows four levels of hierarchical organization and

again reveals the tight connections between the Rules Committee (and its sub-

committees) and the Select Committee on Homeland Security. We also again

observe the close ties between the Intelligence Committee and its subcommit-

tees. However, other connections seemingly apparent in the single-linkage clus-

tering dendrogram are not uncovered by this betweenness-based method. Some

subcommittees are not even grouped with their parent committee; for example,

near the 6 o’clock and 7 o’clock positions, we see a weakly grouped cluster of

committees that includes (consecutively) the Forests and Forest Health Sub-

committee of the Resources Committee, the Select Education Subcommittee

of the Education and the Workforce Committee, and the Western Hemisphere

Subcommittee of the International Relations Committee.

25

Strahler numbers provide a way to quantify the robustness of some of these

diﬀerent groupings. The dendrogram representing the community structure

of the 107th House determined by random-walk edge removal has a Strahler
number S = 4. Its average Strahler number of ˜S

2.7788 quantiﬁes the fact

≃

that many committees break oﬀ as singletons. However, the portion with the

Rules Committee and Select Committee on Homeland Security has a value of 3.

This grouping therefore gives meaningful information (in that it refers to an

actual clique in the network), even though the tree as a whole does not show a

tremendous amount of hierarchical structure.

B.2 Weighted Local Community Detection

We have also constructed dendrograms from our one-mode committee networks

using a local community-detection algorithm generalized from a method for

unweighted networks developed by Bagrow & Bollt (2005). The goal of this

algorithm is to ﬁnd a highly connected set of nodes (a “local community”) near

each node and to combine this information to study the community structure

as a whole. We again use the network of committees weighted by normalized

interlocks that we considered for single linkage clustering.

To detect communities, we start with a given House’s (one-mode) adjacency
matrix A, whose element Aij gives the normalized interlock between the ith

and jth committees. For convenience, we further normalize these elements by

the maximum normalized interlock, so that 0
1. We use these weights
as inverse distances to compute a distance matrix D, where the element Dij

Aij ≤

≤

designates the shortest distance along any path from the ith node to the jth

node. We then deﬁne a clustering coeﬃcient k of a selected group of n nodes

as the sum of all weights within that group divided by 1

2 n(n

−

1).

In our

generalization of the Bagrow & Bollt (2005) algorithm, we deﬁne the d-shell of

node i to be all nodes within distance d of i according to the distance matrix.

We identify the local community of the ith node to be the largest d-shell of node

i with k

α for some threshold α. As α is increased, the deﬁnition of a local

≥

26

community becomes more stringent and smaller cliques are obtained.

We manipulate the resulting collection of local communities (via a so-called

“membership matrix” that encodes this combined information) to produce den-

drograms using the procedure described in Bagrow & Bollt (2005). We obtain

well-structured dendrograms over a wide range of values of the threshold param-

eter α and again observe the close connections between the Rules and Homeland

Security committees in the 107th House (see, for example, the 7 o’clock posi-

tion in Fig. 7). We additionally note that the connection between the Rules and

Homeland Security committees is evident even for values of α for which some of

the other groupings in the dendrogram have disappeared, again indicating the

strength of this connection.

B.3 Direct comparison of dendrograms

In Table 2 we list for each of our methods the maximum modularity obtained for

a single cut and the average modularity over all possible cuts. For the weighted

local community detection method, we used the values of α (denoted α1 , . . . , α8

for the 101st–108th Houses) giving the dendrograms with highest maximum
modularity. These are α1 ≃
0.098133, α4 ≃
0.12597, α2 ≃
0.14409. Similar
0.13677, α6 ≃
0.10308, α5 ≃
modularity values are obtained over a relatively broad range of α. To see the

0.14743, α3 ≃
0.11758, and α8 ≃

0.13753, α7 ≃

number of organizational levels revealed by each algorithm, we list in Table 7 the

maximum, mean, and standard deviation of the local Strahler numbers for the

dendrograms produced for each House. Observe, for example, that the weighted

local community detection method ﬁnds the largest number of organizational

levels.

We ﬁnd it useful to compare dendrograms at the “cuts” corresponding to

their respective maximum modularities.

In our dendrogram plots, we depict

a cut graphically using a concentric circle of appropriate radius, which divides

the network into a number of connected components outside the cut. Table 8

collects these comparisons across the diﬀerent clustering algorithms considered

Table 8: Comparison of House community structure as identiﬁed using diﬀerent

algorithms for the 101st–108th Congresses. The numbers indicate the fraction

of leaf pairs identiﬁed in the same manner in pairwise comparisons of single

linkage clustering (SL), edge betweenness (EB), node betweenness (NB), and

the weighted local community detection method with maximum modularity

(WL). Leaf pairs are identiﬁed in the same manner in two dendrograms if, at

a given hierarchical level, both dendrograms place them in the same subtree or

both place them in diﬀerent subtrees. For each House, we use the hierarchical

level identiﬁed as having the highest maximum modularity. We obtain similar

comparison values over broad ranges of cuts in the dendrograms.

for each of the 101st–108th Houses. The algorithms are compared in pairs,

each tabulated entry indicating the fraction of committee pairs classiﬁed in the

same manner by both methods (that is, both methods identify the committee

pair as belonging to the same community or both methods identify the pair as

belonging to separate communities). Although we list the results from speciﬁc

maximum-modularity cuts in Table 8, we obtained similar comparison values

over broad ranges of cuts in the dendrograms.

As an illustration of the results, we compare in Table 8 the dendrograms for

the 107th House produced using single linkage clustering (Fig. 5), betweenness-

based edge removal (Fig. 11), and our local community detection method (Fig. 7),

29

as well as the single linkage clustering dendrogram for the 108th House (Fig. 6).

The maximum-modularity cuts in these dendrograms have 28, 5, 14, and 25

communities, respectively. For the betweenness-based dendrogram of Fig. 11,

we note that although the number of communities is small, there are other local

maxima of the modularity at which more communities are present. A diﬀerent

cut, for example, gives a local maximum modularity of 0.0969, seventeen sep-

arate communities, and a similarity value of 0.6768 with the local community

detection method.

Several observations are evident from Table 8. First, the betweenness-based

algorithms produce results that are quantitatively similar to each other but

in general less similar to the other two methods. The weighted local clustering

method and single linkage clustering also produce similar community structures.

Even when the quantitative measure of community similarity at the preferred

cuts is low, many committees of interest nevertheless get grouped similarly in

dendrograms produced from multiple methods, suggesting that the observed

close ties between these committees are properties of the networks themselves

rather than of the algorithms used. For example, the Select Committee on

Homeland Security of the 107th House is grouped with the Rules Committee

and its subcommittees using single linkage clustering (Fig. 5), the weighted lo-

cal community determination method (Fig. 7), and the edge-betweenness based

method (Fig. 11). One can also see that the Permanent Select Committee on

Intelligence and its subcommittees are grouped together by all three algorithms.

The recurrence of such groupings in the dendrograms, and even in the visualiza-

tions of Figs. 2–4, further supports the claim that these connections are inherent

properties of the networks themselves.

majorities, the cumulative degree distribution in (a) shifts farther up in each

House and that in (b) shows a similar (but less pronounced) shift. There is no

noticeable trend in the Democrat-majority 101st–103rd Houses in (a), but it

seems to shift up a bit in (b) to reveal a drift covering all eight Congressional

Figure 2: Network of committees (squares) and subcommittees (circles) in the

107th U.S. House of Representatives, with standing and select committees la-

beled. (Subcommittees tend to be closely tied to their main committee and are

therefore left unlabeled.) Each link between two (sub)committees is assigned

a strength equal to the normalized interlock.

(The “interlock” between two

committees is equal to the number of their common members, and the nor-

malization takes committee sizes into account.) Thus, lines between pairs of

circles or pairs of squares represent normalized degree of joint membership be-

tween (sub)committees (it is because of this normalization that lines between

squares are typically very light), and lines between squares and circles represent

the fraction of standing committee members on subcommittees. This ﬁgure is

drawn using a variant of the Kamada-Kawai spring-embedding visualization,

which takes link strengths into account (Kamada & Kawai, 1989).

Figure 3: (Color) Another visualization of the committee assignment network,

with standing committees labeled. This plot is color-coded according to the

mean “extremism” (deﬁned in the text; see Appendix A for details) of each

committee’s constituents, where red nodes are more extreme and blue ones are

less extreme. The link between two committees has strength equal to their inter-

lock (which is not normalized here). Observe that similar groups of committees

are clustered together in this plot as in Fig. 2, despite the somewhat diﬀerent

deﬁnition of link strengths. (This ﬁgure is also drawn using a variant of the

Kamada-Kawai spring embedder.)

this visualization was produced using a variant of the Kamada-Kawai spring

embedder with link strengths determined by normalized interlocks. Observe

again that subcommittees of the same parent committee are closely connected

Figure 5: (Color) Dendrogram representing the hierarchical clustering of the

S
E
S

committees of the 107th U.S. House of Representatives, determined by single

linkage clustering on normalized committee interlocks. Each committee is color-

coded according to the mean “extremism” of its members (deﬁned in the main

text; see Appendix A), from less extreme (blue) to more extreme (red). The

clusters at each level are color-coded according to the average of their constituent

committee extremism scores.

blue and higher values in red. The ties between Rules and Homeland Security

persist (between the 3 o’clock and 4 o’clock positions), despite the swelling in

size of the latter committee to ﬁfty members. As discussed in Appendix B, these

ties are robust with respect to the algorithm used to determine the hierarchy.

Strahler numbers of the communities are calculated as one moves from the out-

side to the center of the tree. When two nodes of Strahler number 1 (dark blue)

combine, they form a community with Strahler number 2 (light blue). We also

ﬁnd communities with Strahler numbers of 3 (green), 4 (orange), and 5 (ma-

roon), indicating the 5 hierarchical levels in the committee assignment network

of the 107th House.

Figure 8: (Color) Singular value decomposition (SVD) of the Senate voting

record from the 107th U.S. Congress. (a) Two-dimensional projection of the

voting matrix, each point of which represents a projection of a single Rep-

resentative’s votes onto the leading two eigenvectors, labeled “partisan” and

“bipartisan” as explained in the text. Democrats (blue) appear on the left

and Republicans (red) are on the right. (Independents are shown in green).

(b) “Predictability” of votes cast by Senators in the 107th Congress based on

two-dimensional projections of the SVD. Individual Senators range from 74%

predictable to 97% predictable.

Figure 10: (Color) SVD of the roll call of the 107th House projected onto the

voting coordinates. Points represent projections of the votes cast on a measure

onto eigenvectors associated with the leading two singular values. There is a

clear separation between measures that passed (green) and those that did not

(red). The four corners of the plot are interpreted as follows: measures with

broad bipartisan support (north) all passed; those supported mostly by the

Right (east) passed because the Republicans constituted the majority party

of the 107th House; measures supported by the Left (west) failed because of

the Democratic minority; and the (obviously) very few measures supported by

almost nobody (south) also failed.

Figure 11: (Color) Dendrogram of the committees of the 107th U.S. House

of Representatives constructed by sequentially removing individual committee

assignments with highest random-walk betweenness (and subsequently recom-

puting betweenness). Committees are listed counterclockwise around the out-

side of the ﬁgure in the order in which the algorithm separates them from the

largest network component. Committees and groups of committees are again

color-coded according to their mean extremisms. The ﬁrst group of separated

committees (just to the left of the 12 o’clock position) includes the Rules Com-

mittee and Select Committee on Homeland Security; this algorithm again indi-

cates their close connection.

Abstract

We propose a model of fractal point process driven by the nonlinear stochastic diﬀerential equa-

tion. The model is adjusted to the empirical data of trading activity in ﬁnancial markets. This

reproduces the probability distribution function and power spectral density of trading activity ob-

served in the stock markets. We present a simple stochastic relation between the trading activity

and return, which enables us to reproduce long-range memory statistical properties of volatility by

numerical calculations based on the proposed fractal point process.

INTRODUCTION

There are empirical evidences that the trading activity, the trading volume and the

volatility of the ﬁnancial markets are stochastic variables with the power-law probabil-

ity distribution function (PDF) [1, 2] and the long-range correlations [3, 4, 5]. Most of

proposed models apply generic multiplicative noise responsible for the power-law probabil-

ity distribution function (PDF), whereas the long-range memory aspect is not accounted

in the widespread models [6].The additive-multiplicative stochastic models of the ﬁnancial

mean-reverting processes provide rich spectrum of shapes for PDF, depending on the model

parameters [7], however, do not describe the long-memory features. Empirical analysis con-

ﬁrms that the long-range correlations in volatility arise due to those of trading activity [4].

On the other hand, trading activity is a ﬁnancial variable dependant on the one stochastic

process, i.e.interevent time between successive market trades. Therefore, it can be modeled

as event ﬂow of the stochastic point process.

Recently, we investigated analytically and numerically the properties of the stochastic

multiplicative point processes, derived formula for the power spectrum [8, 9] and related the

model with the multiplicative stochastic diﬀerential equations [10]. Preliminary comparison

of the model with the empirical data of the power spectrum and probability distribution of

stock market trading activity [11] stimulated us to work on the more detailed deﬁnition of

the model. Here we present the stochastic model of the trading activity with the long-range

correlations and investigate its connection to the stochastic modeling of the volatility. The

proposed stochastic nonlinear diﬀerential equations reproduce the power spectrum and PDF

of the trading activity in the ﬁnancial markets, describe the stochastic interevent time as

the fractal-based point process and can be applicable for modeling of the volatility with the

long-range autocorrelation.

II. MODELING FRACTAL POINT PROCESS BY THE NONLINEAR STOCHAS-

TIC DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION

Trades in ﬁnancial markets occur at discrete times t1, t2, t1, ...tk, ... and can be considered

as identical point events. Such point process is stochastic and totaly deﬁned by the stochastic
interevent time τk = tk+1 −

tk. A fractal stochastic point process results, when at least two

2

statistics exhibit the power-law scaling, indicating that represented phenomena contains

clusters of events over all scales of time [12]. The dimension of the fractal point process is

a measure of the clustering of the events within the process and by the deﬁnition coincides

with the exponent of the power spectral density of the ﬂow of events.

We can model the trading activity in ﬁnancial markets by the fractal point process as

its empirical PDF and the power spectral density exhibit the power-law scaling [4, 13]. In

this paper we consider the ﬂow of trades in ﬁnancial markets as Poisson process driven by

the multiplicative stochastic equation. First of all we deﬁne the stochastic rate n = 1/τ of

event ﬂow by continuous stochastic diﬀerential equation

dτ = γτ 2µ−2dt + στ µ−1/2dW,

where W is a standard random Wiener process, σ denotes the standard deviation of the

white noise, γ

1 is a coeﬃcient of the nonlinear damping and µ deﬁnes the power of

≪

noise multiplicativity. The diﬀusion of τ should be restricted at least from the side of high

values. Therefore we introduce an additional term

exponents λ and β of two power-law statistics, i.e., of PDF and of the power spectrum. Time

scaling parameter σ2 in Eq. (4) can be omitted adjusting the time scale. Here we deﬁne

the fractal point process driven by the stochastic diﬀerential equation (4) or equivalently

by Eq. (2), i.e., we assume τ (t) as slowly diﬀusing mean interevent time of Poisson process

with the stochastic rate n. This should produce the fractal point process with the statistical

properties deﬁned by Eqs. (5) and (6). Within this assumption the conditional probability

of interevent time τp in the modulated Poisson point process with the stochastic rate 1/τ is

III. ADJUSTMENT OF THE MODEL TO THE EMPIRICAL DATA

We will investigate how the proposed modulated Poisson stochastic point process can be

adjusted to the empirical trading activity, deﬁned as number of transactions in the selected

time window τd. Stochastic variable n denotes the number of events per unit time interval.

One has to integrate the stochastic signal Eq. (4) in the time interval τd to get the number

of events in the selected time window. In this paper we denote the integrated number of

N(t, τd) =

t+τd

n(t′)dt′

and call it the trading activity in the case of the ﬁnancial market.

Detrended ﬂuctuation analysis [13] is one of the methods to analyze the second order

statistics related to the autocorrelation of trading activity. The exponents ν of the detrended

ﬂuctuation analysis obtained by ﬁts for each of the 1000 US stocks show a relatively narrow

spread of ν around the mean value ν = 0.85

0.01 [13]. We use relation β = 2ν

[14] and in this way deﬁne the empirical value of the exponent for the power spectral density

Our analysis of the Lithuanian stock exchange data conﬁrmed that the power spectrum of

trading activity is the same for various liquid stocks even for the emerging markets [11]. The

histogram of exponents obtained by ﬁts to the cumulative distributions of trading activites

of 1000 US stocks [13] gives the value of exponent λ = 4.4

behavior of the trading activity. Empirical values of β = 0.7 and λ = 4.4 conﬁrm that the

time series of the trading activity in real markets are fractal with the power law statistics.

Time series generated by stochastic process (4) are fractal in the same sense.

Nevertheless, we face serious complications trying to adjust model parameters to the

empirical data of the ﬁnancial markets. For the pure multiplicative model, when µ = 1 or

η = 3/2, we have to take γσ = 0.85 to get β = 0.7 and γσ = 1.7 to get λ = 4.4, i.e.

it is

impossible to reproduce the empirical PDF and power spectrum with the same relaxation

parameter γσ and exponent of multiplicativity µ. We have proposed possible solution of this

problem in our previous publications [9, 11] deriving PDF for the trading activity N

Nevertheless, we cannot accept this as the suﬃciently accurate model of the trading

activity since the empirical power law distribution is achieved only for very high values of

the trading activity. Probably this reveals the mechanism how the power law distribution

converges to normal distribution through the growing values of the exponent, but empirically

observed power law distribution in wide area of N values cannot be reproduced. Let us notice

here that the desirable power law distribution of the trading activity with the exponent

λ = 4.4 may be generated by the model (4) with η = 5/2 and γσ = 0.7. Moreover, only the

5

smallest values of τ or high values of n contribute to the power spectral density of trading

activity [10]. This suggests us to combine the stochastic process with two values of µ: (i)

µ

0 for the main area of τ and n diﬀusion and (ii) µ = 1 for the lowest values of τ or

≃

highest values of n. Therefore, we introduce a new stochastic diﬀerential equation for n

combining two powers of the multiplicative noise,

Eqs. (12) and (13) deﬁne related stochastic variables n and τ , respectively, and they

should reproduce the long-range statistical properties of the trading activity and of waiting

time in the ﬁnancial markets. We verify this by the numerical calculations. In ﬁgure 1 we

present the power spectral density calculated for the equivalent processes (12) and (13) (see

[9] for details of calculations). This approach reveals the structure of the power spectral

density in wide range of frequencies and shows that the model exhibits not one but rather

two separate power laws with the exponents β1 = 0.33 and β2 = 0.72. From many numerical

calculations performed with the multiplicative point processes we can conclude that com-

bination of two power laws of spectral density arise only when the multiplicative noise is a

crossover of two power laws as in Eqs. (12) and (13). We will show in the next section that

this may serve as an explanation of two exponents of the power spectrum in the empirical
data of volatility for S&P 500 companies [15].

Empirical data of the trading activity statistics should be modeled by the integrated ﬂow

of events N deﬁned in the time interval τd ≫
distribution functions P (N) and its cumulative form P>(n) calculated from the histogram

τ0. In ﬁgure 2 we demonstrate the probability

of N generated by Eq. (13) with the selected time interval τd = 100. This illustrates that

the model distribution of the integrated signal N has the power-law form with the same

exponent λ = 4.4 as observed in empirical data [4, 5].

ﬁnancial markets as well as the PDF can be modeled by the continuous stochastic diﬀerential

equation (12). In this model the exponents of the power spectral density, β, and of PDF,

λ, are deﬁned by one parameter γσ = γ/σ2. We consider the continuous equation of the

mean interevent time τ as a model of slowly varying stochastic rate 1/τ in the modulated

Poisson process (7). In ﬁgure 3 we demonstrate the probability distribution functions P (τp)

calculated from the histogram of τp generated by Eq. (7) with the diﬀusing mean interevent

time calculated from Eq. (14).

Numerical results show good qualitative agreement with the empirical data of interevent

time probability distribution measured from few years series of U.S. stock data [16]. This

enables us to conclude that the proposed stochastic model captures the main statistical

properties including PDF and the long-range correlation of the trading activity in the ﬁ-

nancial markets. Furthermore, in the next section we will show that this may serve as

a background statistical model responsible for the statistics of return volatility in widely

8

accepted geometric Brownian motion (GBM) of the ﬁnancial asset prices.

IV. MODELING LONG-RANGE MEMORY VOLATILITY

The basic quantities studied for the individual stocks are price p(t) and return

(15)

(16)

x(t, τd) = ln p(t + τd)

ln p(t)

−

Let us express return x(t, τd) over a time interval τd through the subsequent changes δxi

due to the trades i = 1, 2....N(t, τd) in the time interval [t, t + τd],

x(t, τd) =

δxi.

N (t,τd)

Xi=1

We denote the variance of δxi calculated over the time interval τd as W 2(t, τd). If δxi are

mutually independent one can apply the central limit theorem to sum (16). This implies

that for the ﬁxed variance W 2(t, τd) return x(t, τd) is a normally distributed random variable
with the variance W 2(t, τd)N(t, τd)

x(t, τd) = W (t, τd)

N(t, τd)εt,

where εt is the normally distributed random variable with the zero expectation and unit

variance.

Empirical test of conditional probability P (x(t, τd)

W (t, τd)) [4] conﬁrms its Gaussian

form, and the unconditional distribution P (x(t, τd)) is a power-law with the cumulative

exponent 3. This implies that the power-law tails of returns are largely due to those of

W (t, τd). Here we refer to the theory of price diﬀusion as a mechanistic random process

[17, 18]. For this idealized model the short term price diﬀusion depends on the limit order

removal and this way is related to the market order ﬂow. Furthermore, the empirical analysis

conﬁrms that the volatility calculated for the ﬁxed number of transactions has the long

memory properties as well and it is correlated with real time volatility [19]. We accumulate

all these results into the assumption that standard deviation W (t, τd) may be proportional

to the square root of the trading activity, i.e., W (t, τd)

k

N(t, τd). This enables us to

propose a simple model of return

In ﬁgure 4 we demonstrate cumulative distribution of v and the power spectral density of

v(t, τd) calculated from FFT. We see that proposed model enables us to catch up the main

features of the volatility: the power law distribution with exponent 2.8 and power spectral

density with two exponents β1 = 0.6 and β2 = 0.24. This is in a good agreement with the

empirical data [15, 19].

V. CONCLUSIONS

Starting from the concept of the fractal point processes [12] we proposed process driven by

the nonlinear stochastic diﬀerential equation and based on the earlier introduced stochastic

point process model [8, 9, 10, 11]. This may serve as a possible model of the ﬂow of points

or events in the physical, biological and social systems when their statistics exhibit power-

law scaling indicating that the represented phenomena contains clusters of events over all

scales. First of all, we analyze the statistical properties of trading activity and waiting time

in ﬁnancial markets by the proposed Poisson process with the stochastic rate deﬁned as

a stand-alone stochastic variable. We consider the stochastic rate as continuous one and

model it by the stochastic diﬀerential equation, exhibiting long-range memory properties

[10]. Further we propose a new form of the stochastic diﬀerential equation combining two

powers of multiplicative noise: one responsible for the probability distribution function and

another responsible for the power spectral density. The proposed new form of the continuous

stochastic diﬀerential equation enabled us to reproduce the main statistical properties of the

trading activity and waiting time, observable in the ﬁnancial markets. In the new model the

power spectral density with two diﬀerent scaling exponents arise. This is in agreement with

the empirical power spectrum of volatility and implies that the market behavior may be

dependant on the level of activity. One can observe at least two stages in market behavior:

calm and excited. Finally, we propose a very simple stochastic relation between trading

activity and return to reproduce the statistical properties of volatility. This enabled us to

model empirical distribution and long-range memory of volatility.

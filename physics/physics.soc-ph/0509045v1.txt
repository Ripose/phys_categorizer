Abstract

The distribution of wealth in the Hungarian medieval aristocratic society is re-
ported and studied. The number of serf families belonging to a noble is taken as
a measure of the corresponding wealth. Our results reveal the power-law nature
of this distribution function, conﬁrming the validity of the Pareto law for such a
society. The obtained Pareto index α = 0.92 is however smaller than the values cur-
rently reported in the literature. We argue that the value close to 1, of the Pareto
index is a consequence of the absence of a relevant economic life in the targeted
society, in agreement with the prediction of existing wealth distribution models for
the idealized case of independently acting agents. Models developed to explain city
populations may also be adapted to justify our results.

1 Introduction

At the end of the XIX century the economist Vilfredo Pareto [1] discovered a
universal law regarding the wealth distribution in societies. His measurement
results on several European countries, kingdoms and cities for the XV-XIX
centuries revealed that the cumulative distribution of wealth (the probability

that the wealth of an individual is greater than a given value) exhibits a uni-
versal functional form. Pareto found that in the region containing the richest
part of the population, generally less than the 5% of the individuals, this dis-
tribution is well described by a power-law (see for example [2] for a review).
The exponent of this power-law is denoted by α and named Pareto index. In
the limit of low and medium wealth, the shape of the cumulative distribution
is ﬁtted by either an exponential or a log-normal function.

The power-law revealed by Pareto has been conﬁrmed by many recent studies
on the economy of several corners of the world. The presently available data
is coming from so apart as Australia [3], Japan [4,5], the US [6], continental
Europe [7,8], India [9] or the UK [10]. The data is also spanning so long in time
as ancient Egypt [11], Renaissance Europe [12] or the 20th century Japan[13].
Since it is diﬃcult to measure wealth, most of the available data comes from
tax declarations of individual income (which is assumed to be proportional
to wealth). There are however some other databases obtained from diﬀerent
sources, like the area of the houses in ancient Egypt [11] or the inheritance
taxation or the capital transfer taxes [14]. The results mostly back Pareto’s
conjecture on the shape of the wealth distribution.

In the present paper, we present and discuss some recent results of wealth
distribution in a medieval society – the Hungarian aristocratic society around
the year 1550. The wealth of the nobles is estimated and expressed in the
number of owned serf (villein) families, a measure generally used by historians.
The case under study oﬀers a somehow idealized example of a society without
a relevant wealth-exchange mechanism and our results give further evidence
for the universal nature of Pareto’s law.

2 Statistical Physics approach to Pareto’s law

Typically, the presence of power-law distributions is a hint for the complexity
underlying a system, and a challenge for statistical physicists to model and
study the problem. This is why Pareto law is one of the main problems studied
in Econophysics. Since the value found by Pareto for the scaling exponent was
around 1.5, Pareto law is sometimes related to a generalized form of Zipf’s law
[15] and referred to as Pareto-Zipf law. According to Zipf’s law, many natural
and social phenomena (distribution of words frequency in a text, population
of cities, debit of rivers, users of web sites, strength of earthquakes, income of
companies, etc) are characterized by a cumulative distribution function with
a power-law tail with a scaling exponent close to 1.

It is however important to notice that, in contrast to what happens with
most exponents in Statistical Physics, the Pareto index α, may change from

2

one society to another, and for the same society can also change in time
depending on the economical circumstances [5,13]. The measured values of
α for the individuals wealth/income distribution span a quite broad interval,
typically in the 1.5 − 2.5 range; a recent study of the Indian society [9] reports
however, much lower values (0.81−0.92). This large variation of α indicates the
absence of universal scaling in this problem – a feature which models designed
to describe the wealth distribution in societies should be able to reproduce.

Models for wealth distribution are essentially deﬁned by a group of agents,
placed on a lattice, that interchange money following pre-established rules.
The system will eventually reach a stationary state where some quantities, as
for instance the cumulative distribution of wealth P>(w), may be measured.
Following these ideas, Bouchaud and M´ezard [16] and Solomon and Richmond
[18,17] separately proposed a very general model for wealth distribution. This
model is based on a mean ﬁeld type scenario with interactions of strength J
among all the agents and on the existence of multiplicative ﬂuctuations acting
on each agent’s wealth. The obtained wealth distributions adjust well to the
phenomenological P>(w) curve. Their mean-ﬁeld results predict that Pareto
index α should increase linearly with the strength of interaction between the
agents and that α = 1 for the case of independent agents (J = 0).

Similar conclusions were obtained by Scaﬀeta et al [19], who considered a
nonlinear version of the model and from other regular lattice based models as
those in Refs. [20] and [21].

Given the known complex nature of social networks (see [22] for a recent re-
view), models were also considered in which the economic transactions take
place on a complex small-world or scale-free network [13,23,24]. More recently,
a model was proposed [25] where the network structure is not predeﬁned but
rather dynamically coupled to the wealth-exchange rule. This model success-
fully reproduces both the characteristics of the modern family relation net-
works and the measured shape of the wealth distribution curves, accounting
for variations in α in the 1.7 − 2.0 interval.

From the studies and modeling eﬀorts made by the statistical physics commu-
nity, one can conclude that the emergence of Pareto law can be understood
from the multiplicative nature of the ﬂuctuations of the agents’ wealth and
from the dynamics of wealth on the underlying complex social network. Both
the experimental results and the models suggest that societies in which there
is strong wealth-exchange among the agents are characterized by higher val-
ues of the Pareto index, whereas societies of isolated agents, where each agent
increases or decreases his wealth in a multiplicative and uncorrelated manner,
are usually characterized by α close to 1. Our measurement results on the
Hungarian medieval society conﬁrm this rule.

3 Wealth distribution measurements in the Hungarian medieval

society

To our knowledge, there is no available data concerning the wealth distribution
and the Pareto law for the Central-Eastern European aristocratic medieval so-
cieties. A ﬂourishing economic life, barter and wealth exchange developed very
slowly in this part of Europe. A centralized and documented taxation system
was also introduced relatively late. Of course, this undeveloped economic life
makes it hard to collect uniform, relevant and large-scale data on this society.
However, once such data is obtained, it could be of decisive importance, since
such a society represents an idealized case, where the agents are acting roughly
independently. The underlying social network and the wealth exchange on it,
are expected to have no major inﬂuence, since the aristocratic families were
more or less self-supporting and no relevant barter existed. This simpliﬁed
economic system provides thus an excellent framework to test, in a trivial
case, the prediction of wealth distribution models.

The ﬁrst centralized data for 47 districts of the medieval Hungary (10 of them
under Turkish occupation) is dated from 1550. The data, in a rough format,
is available in a recent book [26] dealing with property relations of the XVI
century Hungary. For each district, the nobles are arranged alphabetically and
their wealth is grouped in six categories: number of owned serf families and
their lands, unused lands, poor people living on their land, new lands, servants
and others. Using a method accepted by historians [27], the number of owned
serf families is taken as a common measure of the total wealth of a noble
family.

After a careful analysis of all districts and summing up the wealth for those
families that owned land in several districts, we obtained a dataset that is
usable for wealth distribution studies. We also imposed a lower cut-oﬀ value,
chosen to be 10 serf families, and disregard thus the low and medium wealth
aristocrats. This cut-oﬀ is necessary since historians suggest that the database
is not reliable in this ranges. With the above constraints, our ﬁnal database
[28] had data for 1283 noble families and 116 religious or city institutions.
Considering an average of ﬁve persons per family (a generally accepted value
by the historians and sociologists specialized in the targeted medieval period)
we obtain that our sample contains around 6400 people. This represents the
top 8% of the estimated 80000 aristocrats living in Hungary at that period,
and 0.2 − 0.3% of the estimated total population (2.7 millions) of Hungary in
1550.

Ranking the considered families after their decreasing wealth and plotting the
rank as a function of wealth for each family, gives the tail of the cumulative
distribution function for wealth up to a proportionality constant (equal to

1/Nt, where Nt is the total number of families in the considered society).
According to Pareto law, this curve should have a power-law nature, thus
plotting it on a log- log scale should give a straight line with a negative slope,
which yields the Pareto index. The results obtained from our dataset are
plotted in Figure 1.

The power-law scaling is nicely visible on two decades in the ﬁgure, thus
conﬁrming Pareto law with an exponent α = 0.92. This value is comparable
with the ones obtained for the Indian society [9] and much smaller than all
the other values reported in the literature.

As explained above, a value of α close to 1 is in agreement with our expecta-
tions for the studied society. The validity of the Pareto law and the value of
the Pareto index will not change considerably (we get α = 0.95) if we study
only the wealth distribution of the 1283 aristocratic families and neglect from
the database the 116 institutions. Studying however only the wealth distri-
butions of the institutions will not give a Pareto-like tail at all, and on the
log-log scale we will get a constantly decreasing slope (empty circles in Figure
1.) It is also observable from Figure 1, that the Pareto law breaks down in
the limit of the very rich families, where the wealth is bigger than 1000 serf

families. This is presumably a ﬁnite-size eﬀect and such results are observable
in other databases too ([5,9]).

In order to have some information on the time evolution of the Pareto index,
the wealth distribution of the Hungarian aristocratic families in the 1767-
1773 period was also studied. For this period we had rough data [29] available
only for 11 districts. The sample was much smaller than for the year 1550:
we had only 531 families and 65 institutions with total wealth greater than
one serf family. However, as a compensation for the smaller database, in this
case the wealth of each family is given with three markers: the owned number
of serf families, the exact number of owned serfs and the total size of the
owned land. To our great surprise, we obtained for each marker that the
cumulative distribution function of wealth does not give the expected power-
law behavior. Instead of a straight line with a negative slope, we found a
constantly decreasing slope in the log-log plot of the rank as a function of
wealth (Figure 2). The fact that we used only data for 11 districts cannot
be the reason for the breakdown of the Pareto scaling – we checked that, on
the same 11 districts, the 1550 data still gives the Pareto power-law tail. We
believe the reason why the Pareto law is not valid for this database, is that a
large wealthy part of the society is missing. Indeed, in the mid XVIII century
in Hungary there were already many wealthy non-noble families of merchants,
bankers, rich peasants, whose wealth exceeded the wealth of small or middle
class aristocrats. This large category of relatively wealthy families were not
landowners and had no serfs, so they are simply not present in the considered
database. After our estimates, our wealth distribution data gives a reliable
picture of the society only for the wealthier aristocrats, with wealth greater
than 100 serf families. It is believed that the wealth of non-noble families that
owned no land and serfs could not exceed this threshold. As observable however
in the data from 1550, for wealth values larger than 1000 serf families ﬁnite-
size eﬀects are dominant, and the scaling breaks down. There is thus a very
short wealth interval (one decade) where the data is trustful. Fitting a power-
law on this interval leads to a Pareto-index α = 0.99, which is a reasonable
value. This value is also bigger than the one measured in year 1550, suggesting
thus a more active economic life. From this Pareto index value it is possible to
estimate the wealthy part of the society missing from our data (see Appendix
A). The results obtained in such a manner are reasonable ones.

4 Discussion and conclusions

Our study shows that the cumulative wealth distribution of the Hungarian
aristocratic families in the year 1550 exhibits a power-law shape with a Pareto
index α = 0.92. This result is a surprise in some sense, since it is generally
believed that the Pareto index should be bigger than 1. The fact that the

measured value of α is close to 1 is however predicted by existing wealth-
exchange models in the no trade limit, which we believe is applicable to the
type of society under study.

In the model introduced by Bouchaud and M´ezard [16], if we consider the
J = 0 case, the wealth wi of each family varies in an independent, stochastic
multiplicative manner, according to

dwi
dt

= ηi(t)wi + ξi(t)

(1)

where ηi(t) is presumably a Gaussian distributed random variable with zero
mean (< ηi >t= 0), and ξi is an uncorrelated random noise with zero mean (<
ξi(t) >t= 0 and < ξi(t)ξi(t′) >= Cδ(t−t′)). This additive noise is necessary to
prevent wealth extinction and stabilize the power-law type solution in a ﬁnite
system. Following the solution given in [16] we immediately get p(w) ∝ w−2
for the tail of the wealth probability density function p(w), which yields a
Pareto index α = 1 for the cumulative distribution function. The fact that the
measured exponent is smaller than 1 cannot be explained within this model.

The wealth distribution obtained by us has a shape and scaling exponent very
similar to the population size distribution of large cities [15,30]. Zanette and
Manrubia [30] successfully justiﬁed this behavior using a simple reaction-like
model (which is a generalization of the Zeldovich model for intermittency [31]).

Inspired by Zanette et al’s model, one can consider thus that the wealth of
noble i ﬂuctuates in time due to several processes, either exogenous (wars,
meteorological conditions aﬀecting harvest sizes,...) or endogenous (good or
bad administration, gambling,...). So one can assume that wi(t + 1) = λjwi(t)
due to process j, which occurs with probability pj. If there are n such process

to add some noise term to prevent collapse to 0 to obtain (see [30,32]) that
p(w) ∝ w−2 is a stationary solution and thus α = 1. This simple reaction-like
stochastic model is also appropriate thus to understand a Pareto index close
to 1 for a system composed by independently evolving agents.

We have thus argued that the obtained Pareto index, close to 1, can be justiﬁed
in the context of several simple models, compatible with the socio-economical
characteristics of the real system under study. Recalling that a similar value of
α was recently presented for contemporary Indian society, one may speculate
that this is not a mere coincidence, but rather evidence for the minor role of
exchanges in the dynamics of wealthier Indian people.

The value smaller than 1 obtained for the Pareto index in the Hungarian
medieval society is however still a puzzle, and probably further modeling eﬀort
is still necessary to account for it.

5 Appendix A

Let us focus on wealth values greater than one serf family. If we assume that
for wealthy families the cumulative distribution is scaling as P≥(w) ∝ w−1,
the p(w) wealth distribution density function has the form:

The C constant can be determined by taking into account that we have 83
families and institutions with wealth between 100 and 1000 serfs

leading to C = 8300. From here it is immediate to estimate the N1 total

(W0 stands for the biggest reported wealth value, W0 = 6600). This estimate
can be confronted with the results of the census made between 1784-1787. For
the studied 11 districts the total population was estimated to be around 1.6
million, with 45 thousand aristocrats and 33 thousand rich burgers. Taking
again 5 members per family, our database shows that only around 531 × 5 =
2655 aristocrats had wealth bigger than the considered 1 serf family limit.
This value is only 6% of the total estimated aristocrats in the society. Most
of the aristocrats at that time had thus no considerable fortune except their
noble title. The missing 8300 − 600 = 7700 families corresponding to roughly
7700 × 5 = 38500 persons, should be mostly rich burghers or some richer
peasants. This estimate is in reasonable agreement with the census from 1784-
1787.

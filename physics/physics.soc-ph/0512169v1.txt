We examine volatility of an Indian stock market in terms of aspects like
participation, synchronization of stocks and quantiﬁcation of volatility using
the random matrix approach. Volatility pattern of the market is found using
the BSE index for the three-year period 2000-2002. Random matrix analy-
sis is carried out using daily returns of 70 stocks for several time windows
of 85 days in 2001 to (i) do a brief comparative analysis with statistics of
eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix C of correlations between price
ﬂuctuations, in time regimes of diﬀerent volatilities. While a bulk of eigen-
values falls within RMT bounds in all the time periods, we see that the
largest (deviating) eigenvalue correlates well with the volatility of the index,
the corresponding eigenvector clearly shows a shift in the distribution of its
components from volatile to less volatile periods and veriﬁes the qualitative
association between participation and volatility (ii) observe that the Inverse
participation ratio for the last eigenvector is sensitive to market ﬂuctuations
(the two quantities are observed to anti correlate signiﬁcantly) (iii) set up
a variability index, V whose temporal evolution is found to be signiﬁcantly
correlated with the volatility of the overall market index.

1 INTRODUCTION

Various physical phenomena occurring in space and time (like Brownian mo-
tion, turbulence, chaos) have recently found application in the study of dy-
namics of ﬁnancial markets. Financial time series originate from complex
dynamical processes, sometimes accompanied by strong interactions. The
nature of underlying interactions in a stock market is not known much the
same as in complex quantum systems. The interesting fact embedded in
stock market dynamics is that the daily prices on a stock market are not
formed by forces of conventional demand and supply. The market may be
considered as a gigantic complex dynamical system of millions of transac-
tions such that the traders strike equilibrium prices. Every trader is an
own-proﬁt-maximizing agent and her decision or range is not dependent on
previous transactions but on the time evolution of current events.
If the
events occur randomly, prices will be random. In other words knowing the
course of a stocks price is of no consequence for predicting its future [1].
Synchronization of the dynamics of pairs of stochastically ﬂuctuating stock
prices can be modeled using a correlation matrix. Such matrices are stud-
ied in the context of nuclear physics [2]. Random matrix models have been
widely used in explaining the overall behavior associated with spectra and
eigenfunctions of complex quantum systems such as interacting many body
systems- one of them being the Stock Market [3-4]. Time series, such as the
stock market indices are closely linked to the evolution of a large number
of interacting systems or a complex evolving system, now increasingly be-
ing studied by physicists. Price changes in any market are sensitive to the
information arriving in the market. Seasonal and political cycles of events
and rare events like catastrophes increase speculation and uncertainty in the
market leading to high ﬂuctuations in prices or a volatile situation. Volatility
is basically a measure of the market ﬂuctuations. The question of interest
then is whether and how volatility aﬀects the response of market dynam-
ics. It has been found [5] that linkages between stock market indices have
tightened during ﬁnancial crisis or highly volatile periods. That is to say
there is an overall rise in stock index correlations in highly volatile periods
or the rise in correlations is accentuated during bouts of volatility.
It is
also believed that active participation of traders, that is, higher frequency of
dealings/transactions, increases speculation and uncertainty and hence the
market ﬂuctuations. A highly volatile situation is also associated with heavy
exchange of information in the market. A number of researchers [3,4,7] have

2

applied the methods of RMT to ﬁnancial data and found interesting clues
about the underlying interactions. This paper is an attempt, to exposit some
observations that may throw light on volatility. The purpose of this paper is
two-fold. First, it attempts to understand quantitatively the closely related
aspects of volatility such as synchronization and participation of stocks in
the market using random matrix technique and second, to show that this
technique may be used to set up a quantity which possesses a strong predic-
tive power for the volatility of the market. We start with a brief empirical
analysis of the BSE index and show the volatility pattern. The next section
deals with the various exercises carried out using random matrix approach.
We conclude by discussing our observations in the last section. We show a
more detailed analysis of the BSE index in the Appendix.

2 EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS OF BSE INDEX

We ﬁrst consider statistical properties of the time evolution of BSE index.
We label the time series of index as Y (t). We calculate volatility and ﬁnd
the p.d.f of index changes.

2.1 Data Analyzed

This section uses the daily indices of the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) for
a period of 3 years between 2000-2002. BSE is the largest market in India
consisting of stocks from various sectors. Indices are basically an average of
actively traded stocks, which are weighted according to their market value.
Trading is done ﬁve days a week in this market, and we consider the opening
values of indices to be continuous by removing the holidays. Each year
corresponds to 250 days of elapsed time, approximately, the total number of
data points in this set is 750.

2.2 Volatility

Long-range correlation has been found in the amplitude of price changes [6].
The presence of long- range dependencies in absolute value of price changes
points to the existence of a “subsidiary stochastic process” commonly called
as Volatility. As the term may imply, volatility is a measure of ﬂuctuations
that occur in the market. Volatility can be estimated by various methods

3

such as- calculating the standard deviation of price changes, by Bayesian
methods, by averaging the absolute values of price changes in an appropri-
ate time window etc. Statistical properties of volatility prove to be of vital
practical signiﬁcance as volatility is a key parameter in risk management. It
is directly linked to the information arriving in speculative markets. Rare
events or unanticipated shocks, seasonal changes, economic and political cy-
cles (elections, the announcement of the budget in a country) all tend to
accentuate ﬂuctuations. A highly volatile period is marked by increased un-
certainty and a greater propensity of traders to speculate and interact. This
situation is generally accompanied by high prices and is considered good for
any market in terms of eﬃciency and activity.
Computing Volatility:

Volatility, as mentioned earlier, gives us a measure of the market ﬂuc-
Intuitively we can say that a stock whose prices ﬂuctuate more
tuations.
is more “risky” or “volatile”. We may formalize this as : Let Y (t
∆t),
Y (t), Y (t + ∆t), . . . be a stochastic process where Y (t) may represent prices,
indices, exchange rates etc. The logarithmic returns G(t) over time scale ∆t
are

−

G(t) = log(Y (t + ∆t))

log(Y (t))

−

Y (t + ∆t)
Y (t)

≈

(2.1)

∆t refers to the time interval. In this case ∆t = 1 day.

Taking Y to be the BSE index for the period 2000–2002, we plot its
trend in ﬁgure 1. The ﬁgure shows a signiﬁcant change in the value of index
over the period of three years 2000–2002. The rate of change (decrease)
appears to be more for the ﬁrst 450 days than later. We may say that the
Bombay stock exchange follows a long-term trend in the period considered
in the sense that there is more uncertainty say four months in future than
a month in future. The trend also reﬂects on the willingness to take risk on
part of the traders; it seems the market was far more active in the year 2000
than 2001 or 2002. The downward trend maybe attributed mainly to the
economic and/or political cycles in the country. There is a sharp dip in Y
near 9/11/2001 (425th day) after which the index rises and settles without
much ﬂuctuation. This is indicated in Figure 2.

We quantify volatility, as the local average of the absolute value of daily

Last ten days of the period have been ignored. The period 420-440 days
including the date of September 11th 2001 shows a sudden burst of activity.

Figure 3 shows the volatility of the market in the period 2000–2002. It
is interesting to see from here three sub periods (characterized by distinct
volatilities respectively). Each year corresponds to 250 days of elapsed time

7

and we may divide the period into three sub periods: I- 1-250 days (5.65),
II-251-500 days (3.5), III- 501-750 days (2.25). We see that the year 2000
(1-250 days) was extremely active showing very high ﬂuctuations in the mar-
ket and that regions of high volatility occur in clusters showing consistently
high ﬂuctuations in say the ﬁrst 200 days and more. Subsequently the ﬂuc-
tuations decrease in 2001 (251–500 days) . We ﬁnd a more or less uneven
ﬂuctuating pattern in this period. The period marked 420–440 shows a dras-
tic jump indicating that the event of 9/11 which happens to be represented
as the 425th day in the set, did increase the volatility for that period. Obvi-
ously, this highly volatile period does not show any precursors, as it was an
unanticipated event which rattled the market in that period, hence the jump
reﬂects a sudden impact on an otherwise quieter state of aﬀairs. The event of
9/11 was not long lasting as the last time period shows very little ﬂuctuation
indicating a quiescent state in 2002 (501 days onwards). These three time
regimes characterized by distinct patterns of volatility are of interest in order
to observe the volatility pattern of the market.

Since volatility is measured as the magnitude of the index changes, it
may be worthwhile here to compare the return distributions for three time
periods as considered before.

We calculate the probability distribution function (p.d.f), P (Z) of daily

returns, Z

Z∆t = Y (t + ∆t)

Y (t);

∆t = 1day

−

We examine the nature of return distribution for three time periods of
250 days each as before. The distributions for all three periods conﬁrm
to a Levy stable regime (see Appendix). The three distributions (ﬁgure 4)
diﬀer in mean, standard deviation (σ) and the index of the distribution α.
While the periods: 251–500 and 501–750 do not diﬀer much in maximum
probability, the ﬁgure clearly shows the value of probability for small index
changes, P (Z
δz < Z < Z + δz) for the period I is signiﬁcantly lesser than
(less than half) the corresponding values in the other two periods. However,
period I shows a fatter tail, that is, it shows a higher probability for larger
index changes than II, III. A more detailed analysis is shown in the appendix.

3 RANDOM MATRIX APPROACH

Random Matrix Theory was developed by Wigner, Dyson and Mehta [2] in

to explain the statistics of energy levels therein. RMT has been useful in
the analysis of universal and non universal properties of cross-correlations
between diﬀerent stocks. Recently various studies [3-4] have quantiﬁed cor-
relations between diﬀerent stocks by applying concepts and methods of RMT,
and have shown that deviations of properties of correlation matrix of price
ﬂuctuations of stocks, from a random correlation matrix yield true informa-
tion about the existing correlations. While the deviations have been observed
and studied in detail in the context of ﬁnancial markets in earlier studies,
we make a comparative analysis here, in the context of volatile versus less
volatile situations from the point of view of correlations, participation of
stocks in the market and try to quantify volatility in terms of the deviations.

3.1 Data Analyzed and Constraints Involved

As mentioned earlier BSE consists of stocks from various sectors and the
market is operative ﬁve days a week. We must also mention that many of
the stocks are not actively traded and hence not reported regularly in any
period of time. Consequently they do not contribute much to the variations
in stock price indices. Hence we consider here seventy stocks from largest sec-
tors like chemical industry, metal and non-metal (diversiﬁed including steel,
aluminum, cement etc). Since these stocks are actively traded throughout
the year, we believe they would suﬃce to bring out our analysis of correla-
tions in this section. Periods of analysis are conﬁned to 280–500 days. The
correlation matrices for this study have been constructed exactly along the
same lines as in the earlier studies [3-4].

3.2 Cross correlations

We quantify correlations for T observations of inter day price changes (re-
turns) of every stock i = 1, 2, . . . , N as

Gi(t) = log Pi(t + 1)

We construct the cross correlation matrix C from daily returns of N = 70
stocks for two analysis periods of 85 days each (i) 280–365 days and (ii) 340–
425 (see ﬁgure 3) marked with distinct index volatilities respectively. The
probability densities of elements of C, P (Cij) for both periods are compared
in ﬁgure 5. We see that the distribution for period (ii) is more symmetric,
implying a more or less equal extent of positive and negative correlations than
(i) which is characterized by a more positive mean. The ﬁgure also suggests
that there is a de-concentration in higher levels of correlation magnitudes
in a less volatile period (ii) as compared to more volatile period (i). A
clear picture of existence of more pronounced correlations in periods of high
volatility is shown in Figure 7. The simple correlation coeﬃcient between
the <

> and volatility is found to be 0.94 which is highly signiﬁcant.

3.3 Statistics of Eigenvalues of C

The eigenvalues of C have special implications in identifying the true nature
of the correlations. Earlier studies using RMT methods have analyzed C and
shown that 98% of eigenvalues of C lie within the RMT limits whereas 2%
of them lie outside [4]. It is understood that the largest eigenvalue deviat-
ing from RMT prediction reﬂects that some inﬂuence of the full market is
common to all stocks, and that it alone yields “genuine” information hidden
in C. The range of eigenvalues within the RMT bounds correspond to noise
and do not yield any system speciﬁc information.
Eigenvalue Distribution of the Correlation Matrix

In order to extract information about the cross correlations from the
matrix C, we compare the properties of C with those of a random correlation
matrix. C is N

N matrix deﬁned as

T matrix, N stocks taken for T days and G⊤ denotes

values of a random matrix R of the same size as C, shown by the solid line.
The number of deviating eigenvalues is 4 in (i) and 6 in (ii). λ+ for (i) is 9.17
and for (ii) is 10.28.

Figure 6 indicates and increased deviation in case (ii) as compared to (i)
in terms of both number of eigenvalues lying outside RMT range and the
magnitude of the maximum eigenvalue. In the ﬁrst case of a non-perturbed
correlation matrix, 4 eigen-values lie outside RMT bounds; 2 larger than λ+
and 2 smaller than λ−. The largest eigenvalue is 9.17. In case of a perturbed
correlation matrix (ii), we ﬁnd 6 eigen-values deviating from RMT limits; 3
larger than λ+ and 3 smaller than λ−. The maximum eigenvalue is 10.28.
Trend of Largest Eigen-values

Since the largest eigen-value is believed to represent true information
about the correlations between stocks and is indicative of an inﬂuence com-
mon to all stocks, we wish to see the variation of the same as we move from a
no-shock, quiescent period to the one hit by the shock of 9/11. Here we start
by setting up C using daily returns of N = 70 stocks for ﬁxed but progressing
time periods of length T = 85 days. We look at the largest or “deviating”
eigenvalue in the eigenvalue spectrum of C. The trace of the correlation
matrix is preserved throughout, Tr(C) = N. The closer the maximum eigen-
value is to the trace, more information it contains and more correlated the
prices would be. Variation of largest eigenvalue is seen by considering N = 70
stocks for time windows of 85 days advanced each time by two days. Labeling
the ﬁrst and last day of all periods as tf and tl respectively, we set up C as

C(tf , tl) = C(280 + j, 280 + j + 85)

(11)

where j = 0, 2, 4, 6, . . . , 134.

Result of this exercise is shown in ﬁgure 7. We observe, a decrease in
the magnitude of largest for time periods spanning 280–425 days after which
it is more or less constant. The largest eigenvalue is found to be strongly
correlated with volatility of the BSE index (simple correlation coeﬃcient is
found to be 0.94) for all times considered. We study the impact of 9/11 shock
(ﬁgure 8) by carrying out a similar exercise, taking j = 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . , 26.
The aftermath of the event can be seen in the sudden, impulsive rise in
the maximum eigenvalue around September 13th,18th, indicating that the
impact was localized in time.

3.4 Last Eigenmode and the Variability Index

The eigenstates of C deviating from RMT predictions bring out the collective
response of the market to perturbations. Collective motion of all the assets
in the portfolio is signiﬁcantly high, or the stocks are highly correlated in
regimes marked by occasional or persisting bursts of activity. The degree
of such synchronization is indicated by the eigenvector corresponding to the
largest eigenvalue, through the evolution of its structure and components (in
sub sections a & b). Finally in c, we try to quantify volatility in terms of the
largest eigenvector to yield a strong indicator of variability.

3.4.1 Distribution of Eigenvector Components

We wish to analyze the distribution of the components of the eigenvector
corresponding to largest eigenvalue and compare the distributions for three
time periods characterized by diﬀerent volatilities (i) 280-365 (ii) 340-425
(iii) 380-465 as shown in ﬁgure 9.

Figure 9 shows the distributions of components of U 70 are shorter and
broader in less volatile regimes (ii,iii) than in a more volatile one(i). Although
the maximum participation is more in distributions (ii),(iii) the number of
signiﬁcant participants in their sets (components diﬀering signiﬁcantly from
zero) far lesser than (almost half) that in (i). This is dealt with in the next
sub section. In addition we ﬁnd that the components of U 70 for period (i), all
have a positive sign, which conﬁnes the distribution to one side. This ﬁnding
has been interpreted previously [4] to imply that a common component of
the signiﬁcant participants of U 70 aﬀects all of them alike. We also ﬁnd that
for all periods that follow (iii) which are relatively quiescent and not shown
here, contain both positive and negative elements. This goes to show an
interesting link between the strength of the common inﬂuence and volatility.
We may say collective or ensemble-like behavior is more pertinent to volatile
situations rather than non-volatile ones.

3.4.2 Inverse Participation Ratio

We analyze the evolution of the structure of the last eigenstate, U 70 by eval-
uating the Inverse Participation ratio. The IPR quantiﬁes the contribution
of diﬀerent components of eigenvector to the magnitude of an eigenvector. If
νik, i = 1, 2, . . . , N be the components of eigenvector U k then IPR is given
by

Ik =

N

ν4
ik

(12)

Xi=1
Since IPR is actually the reciprocal of the number of eigenvector components
that contribute signiﬁcantly, if all components contribute identically, νik =
1/√N then I = 1/N. As before we set up a correlation matrix C with
N = 70 stocks for T = 85 days, each time shifting the time window forward
in steps of 2 i.e. j = 0, 2, 4, . . . , 134 spanning a period of 280–500 days as
before The pattern of IPR (ﬁgure 10) indicates that the number of signiﬁcant
participants in U 70 decreases as we advance to less volatile periods. The IPR
is closest to 0.0143 ( =1/70), the value we would expect when all components
contribute equally, in the most volatile periods of the time span. The values
of IPR deviate more and more from 0.0143 as we move to the less volatile
periods. In fact the correlation between IPR and volatility was found to be
equal to 0.63.

constructed from daily returns of 70 stocks for 68 time windows of 85 days
each, progressed each time by 2 days spanning a time of 280-500 days.

3.4.3 Variability index

A yet another interesting feature brought out in the analysis of eigenvectors
is the large-scale correlated movements associated with the last eigenvector,
the one corresponding to largest eigenvalue. The average magnitude of corre-
lations of prices of every stock m with all stocks n = 1, 2, . . . , N is <
>m
for m = 1, 2, . . . , N. is varied with the corresponding components of U 70 and
U 2 (lying within the bulk) as shown in ﬁgures 11 and 12 respectively. While
we ﬁnd a strong linear positive relationship (shown in ﬁgure 11) between the
two at all times for the U 70, the eigenvector belonging to the RMT range (ﬁg-
ure 12) shows almost zero dependence. In this ﬁnal sub section we make use
of this dependence to set up a Variability index, which is strongly correlated
with the variability of BSE index.

Figure 12: Plot of the components of eigenvector U 2 associated with an
eigenvalue from the bulk of RMT, λ2. The variation shows no signiﬁcant
dependence between the two. The picture is quite the same for successive
time periods considered.

We deﬁne a projection vector S with elements <

>m where m =
1, 2, . . . , 70, as calculated before. We obtain a quantity Xm(t) by multiplying
each element Sm by the magnitude of the corresponding component of U 70
for each time window t.

(13)

The idea is to weight the average correlation possessed by every stock m in the
market according to the contribution of the corresponding component to the
last eigenvector U 70, thereby neglecting the contribution of non-signiﬁcant
participants (close to zero) in U 70. The quantity X in some sense represents
the true or eﬀective magnitude of correlations of stocks and the sum of such
magnitudes are obtained as

V (t) =

Xm(t),

(14)

may be expected to reﬂect the variability of the market at that time. We
call it the Variability index. We note from ﬁgure 13 that the variability

70

Xm=1

24

index behaves remarkably similarly to the volatility of BSE index as the
time window is slid forward. A highly statistically signiﬁcant coeﬃcient of
correlation of 0.95 is obtained and a positive, linear relationship between
the two can be seen in the plot of V and BSE index volatility set out in
ﬁgure 14. We thus ﬁnd the relevance of the last eigenmode in quantifying
the volatility of the overall market. Similar procedures have been carried out
in other studies [8] in diﬀerent contexts to verify the relevance of this last
eigenvector.

4 CONCLUSION

In this paper we study the volatility of the Bombay Stock Exchange using
the RMT approach. We ﬁnd that the deviations from RMT bounds are more
pronounced in volatile time periods as compared to the not so volatile ones
in the context of Bombay Stock Exchange. The largest eigenvalue, which is
in some sense an index of true information in the entire market [7], is seen to
be highly sensitive to the trends of market activity. A comparison of eigen-
value distributions for two analysis periods before and after the event of 9/11,
show that not only the number of eigenstates deviating from RMT bounds
but also the magnitude of the maximum eigenvalue increases after the event.
The simple correlation coeﬃcient between the two is λmax*BSEvolatility =
0.94. Analysis of the correlation matrix C as a function of time reveals a
strong dependence between the average of magnitude of elements of C and
volatility, indicating highly synchronous movements of stocks in highly ﬂuc-
tuating times or vice versa. A highly signiﬁcant correlation coeﬃcient of
0.94 is observed here as well. The eigenvector associated with the largest

26

eigenvalue, the last eigenmode of C has been enunciated in previous studies
as a collective response of the whole market to certain newsbreaks, bursts of
activity. We have tried to see its role in quantifying the ﬂuctuations. It has
been understood previously by Plerou et.al.[4] that if all the components of
the eigenvector have the same sign then there is some common component
of the signiﬁcant participants that aﬀects all of them with similar bias. The
probability density patterns of the components of U 70 show that while the
distribution in (i) is conﬁned to the positive values of participation, the other
two have spread to the negative side as well, indicating a gradual absence of
existence of a common inﬂuence on the components as we move from more
volatile period (i) to less volatile periods (ii,iii). Hence our ﬁnding here may
suggest that ensemble-like behavior is more prominent in volatile situations
than non-volatile ones. Further, the number of signiﬁcant participants in (ii,
iii) falls to almost half that in (i), a ﬁnding better exposited by the time
evolution of the Inverse participation ratio for components of U 70. A strong
anti-correlation between IPR and volatility (= -0.63) conﬁrms the existence
of a positive association between the number signiﬁcant participants in U 70
with the volatility. It is veriﬁed that the eigenvector U 70 indicates the ex-
tent to which the stock movements are synchronized. We ﬁnd a positive,
linear relationship between the extent to which all individual stocks corre-
>m, m = 1, 2, . . . , N) and the
late or anti-correlate in the market (<
corresponding elements of U 70. Finally we investigate how this may lead to a
quantiﬁcation of variability of the market by taking the product of <
>m
with squares of corresponding elements of U 70. The products for all com-
ponents may be put together as a sum to obtain a Variability index, V . It
is basically quantiﬁed as the sum of correlations of individual stocks, each
weighted according its participation in U 70. Temporal evolution of V and
BSE index volatility, have identical trends and there exists a highly statis-
tically signiﬁcant correlation of 0.95 between the two. In addition we ﬁnd
a close positive linear relationship between the two. We may thus conclude
that the last eigenstate of the cross correlation matrix can be set up usefully
to obtain a quantity that has statistically signiﬁcant predictive power for the
variability of the market at any time.

APPENDIX

Distribution of index changes
Fluctuations in asset prices have been studied through Levy stable non-
Gaussian model (Schulz 2001). Earlier studies [9] on S&P500 index have
shown the return distributions ﬁt into the Levy stable regime with distribu-
tion index α : 0 < α < 2.

We calculate the p.d.f. P (Z) of daily returns, Z deﬁned by equation
, P (Z) is almost symmetric, suﬃciently
3 in the text. We ﬁnd the p.d.f.
leptokurtic and possesses a narrow tail at the ends (ﬁgure 15). To charac-
terize the functional form of the p.d.f., we see the variation of probability
of return to origin P (Z
δz < Z < Z + δz) as a function of time interval
∆t. This is done by taking various sets of returns Z∆t(t) corresponding to
∆t = 1, 2, 3, . . . , 100. We observe a power law decay (ﬁgure 15), which is
consistent with L´evy stable distribution.

−

In general, the probability of return to origin is obtained as

P (Z = 0) =

Γ(1/α)
πα(∆tγ)1/α

(15)

The index of the distribution, α is the inverse of the power law exponent,
0.01. Probability of return to origin is 0.3623 and
and is found to be 1.66
from (4) we get the scale factor of the distribution, γ = 0.6662.

Results of a more detailed analysis are shown in ﬁgure 16. The above
analysis was carried out for 51 periods of 250 days each, starting from the
ﬁrst day of the set and advancing the time intervals each time by 10 days. We
ﬁnd the index α is almost constant (1 < α < 2), but there is likeness between
the variation of γ and volatility of the BSE index. Probability of small index
returns increases with every advance from highly volatile periods towards the
relatively quiescent periods (see ﬁgure 3). The plot of γ and index volatility
(ﬁgure 16) for the times considered shows that the data ﬁt into two separate
positive linear relationships. It is found that the rate of change in the periods
of higher ﬂuctuations, say till the ﬁrst 340 days is 0.63, while it is 0.39 for
then onwards. A possible explanation for this change of scale could be that
probability of low index returns does not increase identically as the decrease
in volatility. A highly signiﬁcant correlation of 0.93 is obtained between γ
and volatility.

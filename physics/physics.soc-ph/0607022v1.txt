The minimum spanning tree is used to study the proess of market integration for

a large group of national stok market indies. We show how the asset tree evolves

over time and desribe the dynamis of its normalized length, mean oupation layer,

and single- and multiple-step linkage survival rates. Over the period studied, 1997-

2006, the tree shows a tendeny to beome more ompat. This implies that global

equity markets are inreasingly interrelated. The onsequene for global investors is

a potential redution of the bene(cid:28)ts of international portfolio diversi(cid:28)ation.

Key words: Eonophysis, minimal spanning trees.

Introdution

This paper examines the extent and evolution of interdependene between

world equity markets over a 10-year period using the Minimum Spanning Tree

(MST) approah of Mantegna [1℄. The approah derives ultimately from graph

theory and has been used as a simple way to study the orrelations of stoks in

a stok market. One advantage that MST analysis has over traditional (cid:28)nane

perspetives on international equity market integration is that it provides a

parsimonious representation of the network of all possible interonnetedness.

With N equity indies the number of possible nodal onnetions is large,
N(N − 1)/2. The MST an greatly redue this omplexity and show only the
N − 1 most important non-redundant onnetions in a graphial manner. The

MST approah also provides useful information in terms of the entrality or

otherwise of individual equity markets (nodes) in the overall system.

A large body of researh exists in the (cid:28)nane literature on the integration

of international equity markets. There are three basi approahes to de(cid:28)ning

the extent to whih international (cid:28)nanial markets are integrated. These fall

into two broad ategories, diret measures and indiret measures. The (cid:28)rst

approah, a diret measure, is ouhed in terms of the extent to whih the

rates of return on (cid:28)nanial assets with similar risk harateristis and maturity

are equalized aross politial jurisditions. We all this a diret measure as

it invokes the so-alled law of one prie. The seond approah involves the

onept of international apital market ompleteness and in essene examines

the extent to whih asset pries and returns are a funtion of domesti or

international fators. The third approah is based on the extent to whih

domesti investment is (cid:28)naned from world savings rather than from domesti

savings. Both of these latter measures an be alled indiret.

In general, where possible, (cid:28)nane researhers onsider the diret approah

to be preferable [2℄. The diret approah to integration has been studied by

a number of researhers who have evaluated the evolution of equity market

orrelations, the extent to whih ommon stohasti trends in returns emerge,

and the spei(cid:28)ation of dynami paths toward greater integration between

the returns on equities. Surveys of this literature an be found in [2,3,4℄. We

ontribute to the researh on the dynami proess of integration through the

use of MST analysis, whih is partiularly suitable for extrating the most

important information when a large number of markets are under examination.

MST analysis has been applied previously to analyze the lustering behavior

of individual stoks within a single ountry, usually the US [5,6,7,8℄. These

studies typially (cid:28)nd a strong orrespondene between business setor and

luster struture, illustrating the ability of the MST methodology to onvey

meaningful eonomi information. While these are stati analysis, a variety of

dynami analysis of the time-varying behavior of stoks has also been devel-

oped in [9,10,11,12,13,14℄. MST analysis has also been applied to the foreign

exhange markets as a means to trae the dynamis of relationships between

urrenies [15℄.

To our knowledge only one study has been published to date applying the MST

approah to groups of national equity markets [16℄. There is one other earlier

study [17℄, whih however used lustering analysis. A simple dynami analysis

based on partially overlapping windows of indies for 20 ountries for the years

1988-1996 (cid:28)nds that markets group aording to a geographial priniple, as

2

is also the ase for a stati examination of 51 world indies for the years

1996-1999 in the same study [16℄. Our researh signi(cid:28)antly extends this work

by applying dynami MST methods to examine the time-varying behavior

of global equity market o-movements for a group of 53 developed, emerging

and developing ountries over the years 1997-2006. This period inludes ma jor

market events suh as the Asian and Russian eonomi rises, the introdution

of the euro, and the enlargement of the European Union (EU). In addition

to on(cid:28)rming the earlier evidene of a geographial organizing priniple we

doument a tendeny of the MST toward higher density over time, indiating

an inreasing degree of integration of international equity markets. Suh a

(cid:28)nding is of interest to portfolio managers and investors, as the impliation is

of dereased potential for diversi(cid:28)ation bene(cid:28)ts and thus perhaps dereased

returns for international investors.

2 Data

We analyze the returns on 53 ountries' equity markets. The data onsist of

Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) daily losing prie indies for

44 ountries, for the period January 8, 1997, through February 1, 2006. An ad-
ditional nine ountries are also inluded in the sample, for a total of 53. These

ountries and indies are: Croatia (Nomura), the Czeh Republi (PX 50),

Hungary (BUX), Ieland (ICEX 15 Cap), Lithuania (Nomura), Malta (HSBC

Bank), Romania (Nomura), Slovakia (SAX) and Slovenia (HSBC Bank). All

series are expressed in US dollar terms as the referene urreny, thus re(cid:29)et-

ing the perspetive of an international investor. All data are soured from

DataStream, Thomson Finanial. One issue that needs to be addressed is the

non-synhronous nature of the data, that is the fat that equity markets open

at di(cid:27)erent times. Reent researh suggests that the use of daily data may lead

to signi(cid:28)ant underestimation of equity market integration [18℄. As a onse-

quene, to minimize the problem of non-synhronous trading the daily index

level data were onverted to weekly (Wednesday) returns: Ri,t = ln(Pi,t/Pi,t−1),
where Pi,t is the losing prie of index i at time t. The resulting number of
weekly observations is 475. The 53 ountries in our study and the respetive

symbols are represented in Table 1.

The reliane for the most part on MSCI indies allows for signi(cid:28)ant on(cid:28)-

dene in the (cid:28)ndings, as these indies are designed expliitly to allow for ross

market onsideration of returns by investors. By ontrast, studies that rely on

indies from the individual equity markets, indies suh as the NIKKEI225,

the DJIA or the FTSE100, run the risk of non-omparability due to di(cid:27)erenes

in onstrution, overage and ompleteness.

3 Methodology

The MST is a onneted graph in whih eah (random) variable in a data set,

here a set of equity indies, is represented by a node. All the N nodes are
onneted with N − 1 links suh that no loops are reated. The orrelation

matrix of the data set, onverted to an appropriate metri, measures the dis-

tanes between indies, or nodes. The nodes are onneted in the MST suh

that the sum of all distanes is minimized.

Constrution of the MST begins with a omputation of the orrelations be-

tween all pairs of weekly returns in the dataset of 53 equity indies. The

4

orrelation oe(cid:30)ient is alulated between all pairs (i, j) as follows:

ρij =

hRiRji − hRiihRji
i i − hRii2)

hR2
(cid:16)

j i − hRji2

(cid:17)

(hR2

r

where Ri is the vetor of the time series of log-returns.

Eah orrelation is then onverted to a metri distane between pairs of stoks:

(1)

(2)

dij =

2(1 − ρij)

q

forming an N × N distane matrix D . The distane dij varies between 0 and
2, orresponding to orrelation values, whih an run from −1 to +1. Small
values of dij thus imply high orrelations. The distane matrix is then used to

onstrut the MST.

We present the results in two setions. We (cid:28)rst show the overall stati MST,

derived from an analysis of the entire sample of data. Following that, a number

of dynami approahes are applied.

4 Results

4.1 Stati results

Shown in Figure 1 is the stati MST for the 1997-2006 period. The lusters

whih we observe appear to be organized prinipally aording to a geographi-

al riterion (possibly also re(cid:29)eting politial and trade riteria). This is similar

to the results in [16℄. To analyze the graph we identify a (cid:16)entral(cid:17) node, the

market most strongly onneted to its nearest neighbors in the tree. With the

highest number of linkages, Frane an be onsidered the entral node. Some-

what surprisingly, the US, whose equity market is globally dominant in terms

of market value, exhibits a somewhat looser linkage to the other markets.

Closely onneted to Frane are a number of the more developed European

ountries in the European Monetary Union (EMU) and in the EU (Luxem-

bourg, a member of both organizations, is not inluded in our data set). This

European grouping forms a set of markets that are highly orrelated with eah

other, with Frane at its enter. We an also identify several (cid:16)branhes(cid:17) whih

form the ma jor subsets of the MST and these an then be broken down into

(cid:16)lusters(cid:17) that may or not be ompletely homogeneous. The Netherlands heads

5

a branh that inludes lusters of additional European ountries (along with

Jordan, anomalously, but whih we shall disuss later). The US links a luster

of North and South Amerian ountries, exept for Peru, to Frane via Ger-

many. Not surprisingly, the three members of the North Amerian Free Trade

Assoiation (NAFTA) - the US, Canada and Mexio - are diretly onneted,

with Mexio forming the link to the South Amerian ountries. Australia heads

a branh with several groupings: all the Asian-Pai(cid:28) ountries form two lus-

ters, one of more developed and the other of less advaned ountries; most of

the Central and East European (CEE) ountries, that joined the EU in 2004,

form an inomplete link to Australia through South Afria, along with Turkey

and Peru. Jordan, whih appears in a European lustering, is an apparent

anomaly. This is likely due to the fat that Jordan is the last node onneted

to the network and has orrelations with other ountries lose to zero, whih

means a relatively high minimum distane. We an onlude that Jordan is an

outlier of our study that does not have any lose relation to any of the other

ountries represented here.

4.2 Dynami results

The MST presents a stati analysis of the relationships between the mar-

kets for the time period as a whole. It is possible, however, also to examine

the time-dependent properties of the tree to provide insights on the hanging

relationships between the equity markets over time. To this end several teh-

niques are used. First, we onstrut what we all rolling and reursive MST.

Seond, we show the evolution of the four moments of the mean orrelations

and mean tree lengths of the MST. Third, alulation of the mean oupation

layer reveals hanges in the ompatness of the MST over time, the degree of

ompatness being interpretable as the extent of overall equity market integra-

6

tion. Finally, the single-step and multi-step survival ratios for market linkages

provide an indiation of the stability of linkages between markets over time.

4.2.1 Rol ling and Reursive MST

The dynami evolution of the MST an be examined by looking at a series of

MST reated from non-overlapping rolling windows, eah with width T = 1
year, or 52 (53) weeks. The MST shown in Figure 2 are those for 1997, 2002,

1

and 2005

. We detet several onsistent relationships as well as a number

of less stable, transient, arrangements. One lear onsisteny is that the de-

veloped European ountries always form the entral struture of the MST.

Initially, Germany is the entral node; however, in more reent years Frane

has taken over this role. The CEE ountries do not form a single luster but

tend to fragment into several subgroups, with hanging omposition year by

year. However, perhaps re(cid:29)eting the growing eonomi and politial ties with

the developed EU members, they tend to move slightly loser to those oun-

tries over time in terms of levels away from the entral node. With respet to

the Asian markets there is usually a link between Australia and New Zealand,

whih often head a branh onneting most of the remaining Asian markets

to Europe. The oherene of the Asian ountries is partiularly evident in

the 1998 MST, possibly re(cid:29)eting inreased orrelations in the region in the

aftermath of the Asian risis. This partiular lustering does not ontinue as

strongly in subsequent years. The main exeption in this group is Japan, whih

does not (cid:28)t into the Asian luster but is generally linked diretly to Western

markets. Here, trade relationships appear to dominate geographi e(cid:27)ets. For

the North Amerian markets the US, Canada, and Mexio are usually losely

linked, re(cid:29)eting most likely the ongoing e(cid:27)ets of both geography and NAFTA

trade ties. An apparent exeption is the year 2005. An explanation of the dis-

onnet in this luster lies in examining the onstrution of the MST. In 2005

relatively higher orrelations between European ountries almost ompletely

dominated the formation of the MST as a luster (cid:28)rst formed around Frane,

followed by a group of CEE ountries (the Czeh Republi, Hungary, and

Poland). The South Amerian markets have not formed a omplete luster

in any of the years under examination; however, a sub-luster of Argentina,

Brazil, and Chile, the largest, most developed and most liquid Latin Amerian

markets, an oasionally be observed. This luster is usually diretly linked

to the European grouping via Mexio.

To further examine the stability of the relationships we onstruted reursive

MST by forming the MST for the (cid:28)rst year and then suessively adding one

year's data at a time. These are shown in Figure 3 umulatively through 1998,

umulatively through 2001 and umulatively through 2005 (again, a full set of

1

The full set of MST graphs is available on request.

7

reursive trees is available on request). Several issues emerge. The (cid:28)rst is that

the MST appears to have beome somewhat more ompat in omparison to

the rolling window MST for 1997 in Figure 2. In the 1997 rolling window, the

maximum number of levels was twelve (entral node Germany to Ieland),

while it is onsistently smaller in the reursive MST beginning with 1998. For

the period 1997-2005, it is seven (entral node Frane to Jordan). Not sur-

prisingly, given the results from the rolling-window MST, the reursive graphs

also re(cid:29)et the dominane of the developed European grouping and the shift

of entral node to Frane from Germany, with Australia, the Netherlands, and

the US at the head of the branhes. The German-US link persists, even as the

enter of the European luster shifts to Frane. The CEE ountries ontinue

to re(cid:29)et some tendeny to split into di(cid:27)erent lusters, although by 2002 six

of them have settled into one group, leaving out only Russia, Slovenia, and

Romania. Hungary and Poland, among the more developed CEE equity mar-

kets, alternate the role of node linking the CEE ountries to the developed EU

members. This luster also gradually moves to a loser attahment to Frane

as that ountry beomes the entral node. The lustering of the Latin Amer-

ian markets, exept for Peru, beomes more onsistent as the time period is

inreased in the reursive graphs, with Mexio generally the link to the Eu-

ropean ore. Similarly, as the time period inreases a more onsistent pattern

is established for the Asian markets. Pakistan and India join the other Asian

ountries in 2001, and Australia and New Zealand in 2002. Japan, whose be-

havior year by year appeared to be largely disonneted from the other Asian

markets, is now seen as tied into the Asian luster via Hong Kong or South

Korea onsistently sine 2001. Finally, a Turkey-Russia-South Afria luster

emerges in 2000 and stays reasonably stable.

4.2.2 Correlation and mean tree length analysis

Rolling-window graphs of the (cid:28)rst four moments of the mean orrelations (eq.

1) and of the distanes dij (eq. 2) are presented in Figures 4 and 5, where the
window length is T = 52 weeks and the window step length is δT = 1 week.

The mean orrelation oe(cid:30)ient is:

ρ =

N(N − 1) Xi<j

ρij.

The variane is given as

λ2 =

2

N(N − 1) Xi<j

(ρij − ρ)2,

while the skewness is

λ3 =

(ρij − ρ)3,

and the kurtosis is

(ρij − ρ)4.

The moments of the distanes dij in the MST an similarly be alulated over

time in terms of the normalized tree length

MST. The variane of the normalized tree length is:

are plotted aording to start date of window.

The mean orrelation and its variane inrease over the initial period overed

by the data, roughly orresponding to the era of the Asian and Russian rises.

In times of market unertainty and downturns these measures tend to inrease

[12,14,19℄. The tendeny of these measures to inrease together has signi(cid:28)ant

impliations for standard eonometri methodology [20℄. We also note that the

skewness dereases toward zero, implying that the distribution of the orrela-

tions beomes more normal. A similar pattern has been observed for British

11

stoks in the FTSE index [14℄. This initial period is followed by delining or-

relations as global markets move past the 1997-1998 risis events. Correlations

rise again, however, possibly re(cid:29)eting the broad market delines that begin

in 2000. An upward spike ours in the fall of 2001, whih orresponds to the

entry into the rolling window of the steepest downturns of global markets as

measured by the MSCI world index. Reovery is aompanied, one again, by

delining mean orrelations. A seond, larger, upward spike is observed as the

window begins to inlude the early 2004 period, whih ours in the ontext of

a broader trend toward higher orrelations. The mean orrelation for weekly

returns for the year ending May 13, 2004, is 0.24223, while that for the year
ending May 20, 2004, is 0.30222. Subsequent orrelations remain relatively

high. Interestingly, this spike oinides with the entry of new members into

the European Union (EU) on May 1, 2004. A breakdown of rolling orrela-

tions shows a strong, abrupt inrease in orrelations for the European group

of ountries at this point, as well as a onsistent tendeny over the entire time

period for their orrelations to be higher than for the set of 53 markets as a

whole. This event has introdued a new element of unertainty as well as the

prospets for loser eonomi ties, both of whih ould tend to inrease or-

relations. In ontrast to these larger movements the introdution of the euro

on January 1, 1999, was not aompanied by ma jor hanges in orrelation

struture.

Essentially the same information provided by the orrelation matrix of returns

an be obtained also from the graphs of the moments of the distane metri

alulated from the MST. The mean distane graph is negatively orrelated

with the mean orrelations, tending to fall, for example, in times of market

risis. This underlines the ability of the MST as a strongly redued represen-

tative of the entire orrelation matrix to onvey relevant market information.

Overall, the mean distane shows a tendeny to derease over the ten years,

indiating a (cid:16)tighter(cid:17) omposition of the MST.

4.2.3 Mean oupation layer

Changes in the density, or spread, of the MST an be examined through

alulation of the mean oupation layer, as de(cid:28)ned by Onnela et al. [12℄

l(t, vc) =

1
N

N

Xi=1

L(vt

i),

(11)

where L(vt

i) denotes the level of a node, or vertex, vt

i in relation to the entral

node, whose level is de(cid:28)ned as zero. The entral node an be de(cid:28)ned as the

node with the highest number of links or as the node with the highest sum

of orrelations of its links. Using these two de(cid:28)nitions, we identify the entral

node for our rolling-windows with T = 52 weeks and δT = 4 weeks. The

12

two riteria produe similar results. Germany is the entral node in the early

years, but Frane takes its plae for most of the subsequent periods. Using the

highest number of links riterion, Frane is the entral node 41.5% of the time
and Germany 27.3%. The highest orrelation sum riterion identi(cid:28)es Frane
as the entral node 53.8% of the time and Germany 30.2%. Other ountries

oasionally assume the position of entral node.

The mean oupation layer an then be alulated using either a (cid:28)xed entral

node for all windows, i.e., Frane, or with a ontinuously updated node. In

Figure 6 the results are shown for Frane as the (cid:28)xed entral node (blak

line), the dynami maximum vertex degree node (blak dots) and the dynami

highest orrelation vertex (gray line). The three sets of alulations are roughly

onsistent. The mean oupation layer (cid:29)utuates over time as hanges in the

MST our due to market fores. There is, however, a broad downward trend

in the mean oupation layer, indiating that the MST over time is beoming

more ompat.

blak dots uses dynami entral vertex based on maximum number of links, while

gray line shows dynami entral vertex based on maximum orrelation value.

4.2.4 Single and Multi Step Survival Rates

Finally, the robustness of links over time an be examined by alulating

survival ratios of links, or edges in suessive MST. The single-step survival

ratio is the fration of links found in two onseutive MST in ommon at times

t and t − 1 and is de(cid:28)ned in Onnela et al. [12℄ as

σ(t) =

|E(t) ∩ E(t − 1)|

1
N − 1

(12)

13

where E(t) is the set of edges of the MST at time t, ∩ is the intersetion
operator, and | · · · | gives the number of elements in the set. A multi-step

survival ratio an be used to study the longer-term evolution

σ(t, k) =

|E(t) ∩ E(t − 1) · · · E(t − k + 1) ∩ E(t − k)|

(13)

1
N − 1

in whih only the onnetions that ontinue for the entire period without any

interruption are ounted.

Figure 7 presents the single-step survival ratios for the MST. The average is

about 0.85, indiating that a large ma jority of links between markets survives

from one window to the next. As might be expeted, the ratio inreases with

inreases in window length. Figure 8 shows the multi-step survival ratio. In

both ases T = 52 weeks and δT = 1 week. Here, as might be expeted, the

onnetions disappear quite rapidly, but a small proportion of links remains

intat, reating a stable base for onstrution of the MST. Again the evidene

here is of importane for the onstrution of portfolios, indiating that while

most linkages disappear in the relatively short to medium term there are

islands of stability where the dynamis are onsistent. The behavior of these

two measures is similar to what has been observed for individual stoks within

a single equity market [12℄. These results may understate the stability of the

global system of markets sine some of the linkage shifts appear to take plae

within relatively oherent geographial groups.

5 Conlusion

The use of the MST provides a way to extrat a manageable amount of in-

formation from a large orrelation matrix of global stok returns to reveal

patterns of links between di(cid:27)erent markets. It provides an insight into market

behavior that is not as easily obtained from the orrelation matrix as a whole.

Applied dynamially, the analysis lets us observe onsistenies as well as evo-

lutions in patterns of market interations over time. As would be expeted,

there is a strong tendeny for markets to organize by geographial loation,

although other, related fators suh as eonomi ties, may also play important

roles. Developed European ountries, with Frane and Germany at their en-

ter, have onsistently onstituted the most tightly linked markets within the

MST. There has also been a limited tendeny of the CEE aession ountries

to link more losely with the more developed EU ountries.

We have seen that the mean orrelations show a tendeny to inrease over the

period as a whole, while mean distanes in the MST and the mean oupa-

tion layers have been trending downward. These dynami measures point to

a ompression of the MST over time, meaning a tighter degree of interation,

or integration, between markets. These (cid:28)ndings have impliations for the in-

ternational investor. International diversi(cid:28)ation under standard Markowitz

portfolio onstrution relies on the existene of a set of assets whih display

onsistent and persistent di(cid:27)erenes in orrelations. These orrelations form

the basis of the MST. From a Markowitz portfolio perspetive [21℄, or any port-

folio perspetive whih relies on a spread of (relatively low) orrelations, the

ompression whih we have observed implies redued diversi(cid:28)ation bene(cid:28)ts

over the time period we have examined. Finally, the multi-step survival ratio

15

also indiates that while lusters of any given period may be homogeneous,

the likelihood of these remaining stable over a reasonable portfolio period is

small. This points to a need for frequent restruturing to make maximum use

of diversi(cid:28)ation bene(cid:28)ts.

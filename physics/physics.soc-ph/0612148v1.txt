Abstract. – A model for growing information networks is introduced where nodes receive
new links through j-redirection, i.e. the probability for a node to receive a link depends on
the number of paths of length j arriving at this node. In detail, when a new node enters the
network, it either connects to a randomly selected node, or to the j-ancestor of this selected
node. The j-ancestor is found by following j links from the randomly selected node. The
system is shown to undergo a transition to a phase where condensates develop. We also ﬁnd
analytical predictions for the height statistics and show numerically the non-trivial behaviour
of the degree distribution.

Motivation. –

It is well-known that large networked information systems (e.g. citation
networks or the Web) are explored by following the links between items [1]. This process is
at the heart of common search engines like Google, and is based on the empirical observation
that an individual surﬁng the Web will typically follow of the order of 6 hyperlinks before
switching to an unrelated site [2]. Practically, search engines mimic this behaviour by sending
”random walkers” who, part of the time, follow links between websites, and otherwise jump to
a randomly selected website in the network. The average number of walkers at a given node is
the measure of the importance of the node in the network (e.g. the Google Rank number). In
view of this search mechanisms, one expects that nodes with a higher density of walkers are
visited more often, and should therefore receive more links from newly introduced nodes. This
feed-back mechanism leads to an increase of the selected node degree, in a manner that may
naively remind preferential attachment [3], as well as its density of walkers, thereby increasing
the probability of the selected node to be chosen in the future, etc...

In its most basic form, a growing network with redirection is deﬁned as follows: a node
enters the system, ﬁrst connects to a target node (chosen randomly in the whole network) and
then, with some probability p, redirects its link to the ancestor of the target node. This model
is well-known [4] to lead to linear preferential attachment in the network, and to reproduce
ν, with ν = 1 + 1/p. However, more realistic
the formation of fat tail degree distributions k−
situations where the entering node follows j 6= 1 links before connecting to a node (see Fig.1)
have not been considered yet. Since now on, we call this recursive exploration of the network
j-redirection. In the following, we will mainly focus on the 2-redirection case and restrict the
scope to networks where nodes have only one outgoing link. We will show how this slight

Fig. 1 – Sketch of a time step of the model with 1-redirection or 2-redirection. The system is composed
of 7 nodes and a new node, labelled with 8, enters the network and randomly selects the marked node
(node 4). If 1-redirection takes place, the entering node connects to the father of the marked node
with probability p. If 2-redirection takes place, the entering node connects to the grand-father of the
marked node with probability p. Otherwise, the entering node connects to the marked node.

generalization leads to much more complicated situations than in the case j = 1, such as the
formation of condensates in the network.

Basic model. – Let us ﬁrst study the simplest version of the model where entering nodes
explore the network with 1-redirection. Initially (t = 0), the network is composed of node, the
seed, and each time step t, a new node enters the network. Consequently, the total number
of nodes is equal to N = 1 + t, and the number of links is L = t. We will focus on the height
distribution, the height of a node [5] being deﬁned to be the minimum number of links to the
seed. The probability that a node at the depth g in the directed network receives the link is:

except for the seed g = 0:

Pg ∼ (1 − p)Ng + pNg+1,

P0 ∼ N0 + pN1,

where Ng is the average number of nodes at depth g. The normalisation follows:

Putting the above pieces together, it is straightforward to show that the rate equation for Ng
reads in the continous time limit:

N0 + pN1 +

Fig. 2 – Typical realizations of the 2-redirection model after 100 time steps for p = 0.0, p = 0.4 and
p = 0.8 (left to right).

As a ﬁrst level of description, we derive an equation for the average total height G =
from Eq.4, that reads in the long time limit t ≫ 1:

∞g=0 gNg

P

∂tG = [(1 − p) +

].

This equation leads to the asymptotic behaviour G ∼ (1 − p)t ln t, i.e. the redirecting process
slows down the growth of the network. This is expected as redirection favours the connection
to nodes closer to the seed. In the limiting case p = 1, where the process is easily shown to
lead to a star network (i.e. all the nodes are connected to the seed), one ﬁnds G ∼ t.

Condensation in the 2-redirection model. – Let us now focus on the more challenging
case when the network is explored with 2-redirection. The generalization to any value of j > 1
is straightforward and will be rapidly discussed at the end of this section. The probability
that a node at the depth g in the directed network receives the link is:

except for the seed, where:

and where the normalization follows:

Pg ∼ (1 − p)Ng + pNg+2,

P0 ∼ N0 + pN1 + pN2,

The rate equation for Ng and the equation for the average G are respectively:

where ng ≡ Ng/N is the proportion of nodes at height g. There are obviously two possible
cases. i) If n1 is vanishingly small in the long time limit, Eq.10 simpliﬁes into

∂tG = (1 − 2p) +

G
t

,

whose solution is G ∼ (1 − 2p)t ln t. This solution suggests that a qualitative change occurs
around pC = 1/2. ii) If n1 does not vanish in the long time limit, this term has to be taken
into account. Let us stress that a ﬁnite value of n1 implies the formation of a condensate in
the network, i.e. the seed attracts a non-vanishing fraction of the links in the network [6–9].
Let us evaluate the values of p for which such a condensate exists and the corresponding

value of n1. To do so, one needs to ﬁnd stationary solutions to the equations for ng:

(1 + t)∂tn1 = (n0 + pn1 + pn2) − n1
(1 + t)∂tng = [(1 − p)ng

1 + png+1] − ng.

The stationary solution are found by recurrence and by using the fact that n0 is negligible
Indeed, N0 is (and remains) equal to 1 by construction, so that
in the long time limit.
N0/N = 1/N → 0. It is straighforward to show that the stationary solution is in general:

so that the average height G/t asymptotically goes to a constant, in agreement with the
observed formation of condensates. Before focusing on the regime p < 1/2, let us stress
that the existence of non-vanishing stationary values of ng is not possible in the 1-redirection
model. In contrast, the formation of condensates takes place for any other j-redirection j > 1.
This result is straightforward after generalizing Eq.10 into:

Fig. 3 – In the left ﬁgure, relation between the index of the ﬁrst negative amplitude F (β) and the
possible eigenvalue β. The results are obtained by numerically integrating Eq.17 up to gmax = 5000.
The method shows that a whole region of β exists where all Ag are positive. Let us stress that F (β)
is limited to the maximum value gmax by construction. In the right ﬁgure, observed value of β(p)
obtained by integrating numerically the dynamical equations Eq.16. At τ = 200, the derivatives
Di = ∂(ln Ni)/∂τ are measured and are shown to be independent of i. Results are compared with
those obtained with the ﬁrst negative amplitude approach. The small discrepancies are due to non-
stationary eﬀects, i.e. at τ = 200, the system has not yet reached its asymptotic state. The dotted
line is the theoretical prediction Eq.21.

we have shown above that β = 1 is a proper eigenvalue and found the eigenvector Eq.13. In
the following, we look for the solution β(p) that is reached when p < 1/2. Solving the whole
spectrum of eigenvalues of the matrix dynamics is out of question. Instead, we introduce the
ansatz Ni = Aitβ and look for the solutions Ai:

which can be solved by recurrence:

(18)

A priori, any value of β ∈]0, 1[ is available, except those for which any of the amplitudes
Ai becomes negative. In order to evaluate the values of β that respect this condition, we have
integrated numerically the above recurrence relations and looked, at a ﬁxed value of p, for the
relation F (β), where F is the index of the ﬁrst amplitude AF that becomes negative, so that
no amplitude Ag is negative. By construction, F (β) should go to inﬁnity for allowed values
of β. Numerical integrations (Fig.3a) show that a whole region of β < βC are excluded due
to this non-negativity constraint. In contrast, any value β > βC keeps all Ai positive and is
a priori susceptible to be chosen. However, numerical integration of Eq.17 suggest that only
this value βC is selected by the dynamics (Fig.3b). In the limiting case p → 1/2, the value
β = 1 is recovered.

Let us try to evaluate analytically the location of the transition. To do so, we focus on

the relation

Above this value, the amplitude Ag is deﬁnite positive and asymptotically behaves like en
2p+√∆)g, where ∆ = −1+2β−4p+4p2. Below this value, in contrast, the
exponential Ag ∼ e(1
solution exhibits an oscillatory behaviour Ag ∼ e(1
1 − 2β + 4p − 4p2.
Consequently, this solution exhibits negative solutions, i.e. these values of β are forbidden.
Comparison of this theoretical prediction with the numerical results (Fig.3b) show an excellent
agreement, at least for small values of 1/2 − p. Let us stress, though, that deviations from
this continuous approximation take place for large values of 1/2 − p. Indeed, βC goes to 1/2
in the limit p → 0, while one expects (and measures by integrating Eq.17) that βC should go
to zero.

Degree distribution. – As soon j-redirections with j > 1 are introduced, the model
exhibits complications in order to derive a closed equation for the degree distribution. This
is due to the fact that a 2-variable distribution for the degrees of the nodes at the extremities
of one link [4] has to be added in order to account for the 2-redirections. Similarly, once
one tries to write an equation for that distribution, the distribution involving three degrees
characterizing two adjacent links has to be considered, etc., leading to an inﬁnite hierarchy.
A mean ﬁeld description through a truncature of the hierarchy at some level, even though
possible in principle, has not been fulﬁlled yet and remains an open problem. In the following,
we restrict the scope to a numerical analysis of the degree distribution. To do so, we perform
50 computer realizations of the random process, measure the degree distribution after long
times t > 106 and average over the many realizations.

Computer simulations show (Fig.4) that the distribution reaches a stationary distribution
except for a peak in its tail that advances in time. One observes that this peak velocity

is ∼ tβC , with βC(p) deﬁned above. This result is expected as the average seed degree is

this asymptotic state by measuring the degree distributions at diﬀerent times t.

Conclusion. –

In this Letter, we have focused on a simple model of growing directed
networks, where the probability for a node to receive a link depends on the number of paths
of length j arriving at this node. This process, that we called j-redirection, generalizes a
redirection process known to lead to preferential attachment [4] and mimics the way people
explore the Web. We have shown that when j ≥ 2, the system undergoes a transition to a
regime where condensates develop around the seed node. Condensates are nodes that receive a
non-vanishing fraction of the links when the number of nodes N goes to inﬁnity. Let us stress
that such states have been observed in other types of model [6–9], and that such winner-takes-
all phenomena are associated to extreme conﬁgurations of the network, where a monopoly-
like conﬁguration develops. We have also focused on the degree distribution arising in such
systems. Computer simulations show that the degree distribution asymptotically reaches an
almost stationary state, where only the degree of the seed makes the solution unstationary.
It is remarkable to
The stationary part is shown to converge to a power-law distribution.
note that the exponents belong to the interval [2, 3] for most of the values of the redirecting
probability p. Let us stress that this eﬀect reminds the properties of another model with
redirection [10]. The mechanism that we propose could therefore give an explanation for the
proliferation of exponents in that interval [11] in many empirical studies, e.g. collaboration
networks [12], the Web [13]... To conclude, we would like to insist on the generality and
simplicity of our approach, that is shown to exhibit a complex phenomenology. As a next
step, analytical predictions for the degree distributions, based on mean ﬁeld assumptions,
should be considered in order to improve our knowledge of the model.

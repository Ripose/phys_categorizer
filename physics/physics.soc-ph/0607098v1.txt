The statistical distances between countries, calculated for various moving average time windows,
are mapped into the ultrametric subdominant space as in classical Minimal Spanning Tree methods.
The Moving Average Minimal Length Path (MAMLP) algorithm allows a decoupling of ﬂuctuations
with respect to the mass center of the system from the movement of the mass center itself. A
Hamiltonian representation given by a factor graph is used and plays the role of cost function.
The present analysis pertains to 11 macroeconomic (ME) indicators, namely the GDP (x1), Final
Consumption Expenditure (x2), Gross Capital Formation (x3), Net Exports (x4), Consumer Price
Index (y1), Rates of Interest of the Central Banks (y2), Labour Force (z1), Unemployment (z2),
GDP/hour worked (z3), GDP/capita (w1) and Gini coeﬃcient (w2). The target group of countries
is composed of 15 EU countries, data taken between 1995 and 2004. By two diﬀerent methods (the
Bipartite Factor Graph Analysis and the Correlation Matrix Eigensystem Analysis) it is found that
the strongly correlated countries with respect to the macroeconomic indicators ﬂuctuations can be
partitioned into stable clusters.

INTRODUCTION

Modeling the dependences between the macroeconomic (ME) variables has to take into account circumstances that
diﬀer substantially from those encountered in the natural sciences. First, experimentation is usually not feasible
and is replaced by survey research, implying that the explanatory variables cannot be manipulated and ﬁxed by the
researcher. Second, the number of possible explanatory variables is often quite large, unlike the small number of
carefully chosen treatment variables frequently found in the natural sciences. Third, the ME time series are short and
noisy. Most data have a yearly frequency. When social time series have been produced for a very long period, there
is usually strong evidence against stationarity.

Some macroeconomic (ME) indicators are monthly and/or quarterly registered, increasing in this way the number
of available data points, but some additional noise is naturally enclosed in the time series so generated (seasonal
ﬂuctuations, external and internal short range shocks, etc). This seems to be a solid argument for the fact that the
main data sources, at least the ones freely available on the web, tend only to keep the annual averages/rates of growth
of the ME indicators.

Let us consider, for example, a time interval of one hundred years, which is mapped onto a graphical plot of 100
data points. From the statistical physics viewpoint, 100 is a quite small number of data points, surely too small for
speaking about the so called thermodynamic limit. On the other hand, from a socio-economic point of view, we can
justiﬁably wonder if a growth, say, of 2% of any ME indicator has at the present time the same meaning as it had
one century ago. One must take into account that during that time, the social, politic and economic environment was
drastically changed. Moreover the methodology of data collecting and processing is today diﬀerent from what it was
two generations ago. Indeed, the economic world is created by people and is substantially changing from a generation
to another one (sometimes also during one and the same generation). Thus, this way of statistical data aggregation
turns to be controversial.

Several papers [1, 2] investigated the statistical patterns in GDP annual rates of growth by aggregating (in a
”horizontal” way) the data from all countries for which statistical data were reported. Even if all data are supposed to
be reliable, and even if the relative rates of growth are investigated (to diminish the actual large diﬀerence inﬂuences),
this way of aggregation, as well as the previous one, supposes a priori a certain degree of homogeneity across countries.
A certain GDP rate of growth in an underdeveloped country is certainly based on factors that diﬀer substantially from
the ones that generate the same rate of growth in a developed country. Both theoretical and empirical investigations
[3, 4] reported the evidence of the country partitioning in clusters after their common patterns of evolution. For such
subsystems only, the data might be meaningfully aggregated. In the present paper we demonstrate the clustering
emergence in the relatively stable and homogeneous system composed of the 15 EU countries for data taken between
1994 and 2004, starting from the annual rates of growth of 11 ME indicators, namely the GDP (x1), Final Consumption
Expenditure (x2), Gross Capital Formation (x3), Net Exports (x4), Consumer Price Index (y1), Rates of Interest of

2

the Central Banks (y2), Labour Force (z1), Unemployment (z2), GDP/hour worked (z3), GDP/capita (w1) and Gini
coeﬃcient (w2).

One has to stress here that the problem of studying the patterns of growth across countries is actually a subject of
great attention to economists [4, 5]. An important reason for the increasing interest in this problem is that persistent
disparities in aggregate growth rates across countries have, over time, led to large diﬀerences in welfare. On the
other hand, the intellectual payoﬀs are high: various statistical tools might be considerably enriched and extended by
applying them to the non-stationary, short and noisy macroeconomic time series.

In the present paper we focus on two recent lines of research, of growing interest in physics, which can bring
important contributions to ME time series analysis. On one hand, the recent developments in nonequilibrium networks
[6]; on the other hand, the random matrix theory (RMT), initially developed in nuclear physics, also successfully used
in the study of canonical correlations between stock changes and portfolio optimization problem [7]. The way in which
these methods are adapted to the macroeconomic time series analysis is described in the next section.

The Minimal Spanning Tree (MST) is one of the most usual methods in cluster analysis, and has been largely used
so far both by physicists [8] and economists [4]. Nonetheless, both sides [4, 7] noted some lack of univocity due to
choosing the MST root. Moreover, the MST structure proves to be not stable when a constant size time window
is moved over the considered time span. The solution brieﬂy presented in Section 3, namely the Moving Average
Minimal Length Path (MAMLP) method comes as a development of some previous methods where some arbitrariness
in the root of the tree was underlined considering that an a priori more common root, like the sum of the data, called
the ”All” country, from which to let the tree grow was permitting a better comparison [9].

The target group of countries is composed of 15 EU countries, data taken between 1994 and 2004. The main
sources used for all the above indicators annual rates is the World Bank database [10] and the OECD database
[11]. We abbreviate the countries according to the Roots Web Surname List (RSL) which uses 3 letters standardized
abbreviations to designate countries and other regional locations (http://helpdesk.rootsweb.com/codes/). Inside the
tables, for spacing reasons we use the countries two letters abbreviation (http://www.iso.org).

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 the theoretical and methodological tools from the
network analysis and matrix theory which we try to adapt to the considered time series are brieﬂy described. The
results are largely presented and discussed in Section 3. Some concluding remarks are done in Section 4.

II. THEORETICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK

As mentioned in Sect. 1, MST cannot be built in a unique way, whence this becomes a problem when we try to
construct a cluster hierarchy for each position of a moving time window. The hierarchical structure proved to be
not robust against ﬂuctuations induced by a moving time window. In the MAMLP method described here below
we propose to construct the hierarchy starting from a virtual ’average’ agent. The method is developed in the
following steps: (i) An ”AVERAGE’ agent (AV) is virtually included into the system; the statistical distance matrix
is constructed, and thereafter, the elements are set into increasing order (i.e. the decreasing order of correlations); (ii)
The hierarchy is constructed, connecting each agent by its minimal length path (MLP) to AV. Its minimal distance to
AV is associated to each agent. (iii) The procedure is repeated by moving a given and constant time window (in this
case a 5 years time window size) over the investigated time span (in the present analysis: 1994-2004). The agents are
sorted through their movement inside the hierarchy. Therefore, a new correlation matrix between country distances
to their own mean is constructed. The matrix elements are deﬁned as:

ˆCi,j(t) =

< ˆdi(t) ˆdj(t) > − < ˆdi(t) >< ˆdj (t) >
< ( ˆdi(t))2− < ˆdi(t) >2>< ( ˆdj (t))2− < ˆdj(t) >2>

q

(1)

where ˆdi(t) is the i-country minimal length path (MPL) distance to the AVERAGE. For simplicity, the explicit
dependencies on the time window size T are not included in Eq. (1).

Let us recall that for systems with discrete degrees of freedom, denoted by s, the statistical mechanical models
are generally deﬁned through the Hamiltonian H = H(s), which is typically a sum of terms, each involving a small
number of variables. A useful representation is given by the factor graph [12]. A factor graph is a bipartite graph
made of variable nodes i, j, . . . one for each variable, and function nodes a, b, . . . one for each term of the Hamiltonian.
In the present approach the variable nodes are the macroeconomic indicators and the function nodes are the countries.
An edge joins a variable node i and a function node a if and only if i ∈ a, i.e., the variable si appears in Ha - the

term of the Hamiltonian associated to a. The Hamiltonian can then be written as:

H =

Ha(sa), with sa = {si, i ∈ a}

(2)

In combinatorial optimization problems [12], the Hamiltonian plays the role of a cost function. In the low tempera-
ture limit T → ∞, one is interested by only minimal energy states (ground states) having a non-vanishing probability.
Usually, a cluster k is deﬁned as a subset of the factor graph such that if a function node belongs to k, then all the
variable nodes i ∈ a also belong to k (while the converse needs not to be true, otherwise the only legitimate clusters
would be the connected components of the factor graph). Here, this condition will be relaxed by partitioning the
function nodes after the criterion if it is connected or not to a certain variable node.

Once the correlation matrix is constructed, it is natural to ask for the interpretation of its eigenvalues and eigen-
vectors. Note that since the matrix is symmetric, the eigenvalues are all real numbers. We will call va the normalized
eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue λa, with a = 1, 2, . . . , M.. The vector va is the list of the weights va,i in this
linear combination of the diﬀerent countries. The variance corresponding to such a combination is thus:

ﬂuctuations ea, which are the elements of the system constructed from the weights va,i:

In this decomposition, usually called ”the principal component analysis”, the correlated ﬂuctuations of a set of
random variables are decomposed in terms of the ﬂuctuations of underlying uncorrelated factors. In the case of the

indicators.

Since, as generally accepted [7, 13], the largest eigenvectors are the ones carrying the useful information, one can
try to deﬁne clusters on the basis of the structure of these eigenvectors. Often (but not always), the largest one,
v1, has comparable and of the same sign components on all countries, and deﬁnes the largest cluster, containing all
countries. The second one, v2, which by construction has to be orthogonal to v1, may have some of its components
positive, and the others negative. This means that a probable move of the countries around the average (global)
ﬂuctuations occurs when some countries over-perform the average, and others under-perform it. Therefore, the sign
of the components of v2 can be used to group the countries in two families. Each family can then be divided further,
using the relative signs of v3, v4, etc.

III. RESULTS

A. The statistics of the correlation coeﬃcients

In order to exemplify the MAMPL method, the corresponding steps for x1 = GDP are explicitly shown below.
Firstly, the virtual ’AVERAGE’ country is introduced in the system. The statistical distances corresponding to the
ﬁxed 5 years moving time window are set in increasing order and the minimal length path (MPL) connections to the
AVERAGE are established for each country in every time interval (Table I).

The resulting hierarchy is found to be changing from a time interval to another. Therefore, corresponding correlation
matrix is built, this time for the country movements inside the hierarchy (Table II). The above procedure is repeated
for each macroeconomic indicator. Thus, the MAMPL method leads us to a set of M = 11 correlation matrices,
having size N × N , where N = 15 is the number of countries under consideration.

Firstly, we analyse the whole set of correlation coeﬃcients. A correlation coeﬃcient ˆCi,j will be taken into account
as representing a strong connection if and only if | ˆCi,j | > Cthr, where Cthr is a certain a priori chosen threshold

FIG. 1: The cumulative distribution of the correlation coeﬃcients and the relative number of connections versus the | ˆCi,j| ≡ |C|
(respectively Cthr ≡ |C|)

value. For small values of the Cthr, all 15 countries have at least one strong connection, i.e.
the graph is fully
connected. Increasing the Cthr, the number of the connections decreases. In Fig. 1 the relative number of links (the
ratio between the number of actual links and the number of all possible links) is plotted versus the threshold value.
One can observe that the data is well ﬁtted by a low order polynomial. In Fig. 1 the cumulative distribution of
the correlation coeﬃcients is also plotted (now, the values are the cumulative frequencies and the abscissas are the
corresponding correlation coeﬃcients). For comparison, the cumulative uniform distribution is also plotted. The high
value of the square of the Pearson product moment correlation coeﬃcient, R2 > 0.99, indicates a good ﬁt of both
distributions.

Nevertheless, performing the χ2 test over the whole set of correlation coeﬃcients we must reject the null hypothesis
of the ﬁtting |C| distribution by the uniform in the conﬁdence interval of 99 %. Investigating by sight the data set
one remarks an anomalous large number of correlation coeﬃcients (N20 = 100) in the range 0.95-1.00, while the
mean of the distribution is 57.75 and the standard deviation is σ = 7.45. According to Chebyshev’s theorem [14],
an interval of ±4 standard deviations ensures that at least 94 % of the data (of an arbitrary distribution) falls inside
this interval. Thus, the last point of the distribution can be treated as an outlier, and, performing the χ2 test for
the remainder points we can accept the hypothesis of the same distribution in a conﬁdence interval of over 75 %. We
must note here that the same conclusion is supported by t-Student’s test in a conﬁdence interval of 100 %, the two
distributions having exactly the same mean. Joining together the results of the statistical tests, we can conclude that
the correlation coeﬃcients distribution is a uniform distribution.

B. The bipartite factor graph analysis

As it has been already shown, the factor graph structure is strongly dependent on the threshold value Cthr. In order
to establish the most appropriate Cthr, a two tailed t-test of statistical signiﬁcance is performed over the correlation
matrix elements [14]. The null hypothesis (a correlation coeﬃcient of zero) assumes that there is no linear relationship

where r ≡ ˆCi,j and n = 2 is the number of degrees of freedom. The correlation coeﬃcient is considered to be
statistically signiﬁcant if the computed t value is greater than the critical value tC of a t-Student’s distribution with
a level of signiﬁcance of α. From Eq. (6) one derives:

Taking n = 7 (the number of statistical distances used for computing each correlation coeﬃcient, from the t-Student
distribution tables we ﬁnd the critical value tC = 3.365 for a reasonable level of signiﬁcance α = 0.02 (or, equivalently,
98 % conﬁdence interval). From Eq. (7) we get rC ≡ Cthr = 0.83 i.e. the null hypothesis can only be rejected for the
correlation coeﬃcients greater or at least equal to this value. The signiﬁcant correlation coeﬃcients are emphasized
in bold in Table II.

It is interesting to remark that the two plots from Fig. 1 do intersect at the abscissa 0.83 which is equal to the rC
above found. The intersection point seems to correspond to an optimal choosing of Cthr, under the constrain of the
competition between link removing and the remainder correlations to be taken into account.

One can easily see that not all 15 countries (function nodes) are connected through the variable node x1 (GDP

ﬂuctuations), but only 11 of them. Their contributions to the Hamiltonian include the variable x1.

The above procedure is repeated for each ME variable and leads us to the Hamiltonian (or cost func-
tion) having the form: H = AU T (x1, x2, x3, x4, y2, z1, z2, z3, w1, w2) + BEL(x1, x2, x3, y1, y2, z1, z3, w1, w2) +

C. The correlation matrix analysis

From the result of the bipartite graph analysis, some countries binary partition in respect to each ME variable can
be already seen: a country is connected or not to the respective variable node. Nonetheless, a complete solution to
this problem can only be obtained by analyzing the correlation matrix eigensystems. A parallel to similar results from
the stock market investigation [7, 13] can be also drawn.

The eigenvalue spectrum for the empirical correlation matrices is plotted in Fig. 2 for all the ME variables. The
results are compared with those of a random uncorrelated matrix (RM), having the same size (15 × 15), constructed
by generating random numbers.

In stock market analysis the largest eigenvalue, often called ”market eﬀect”, is supposed to describe the collective
movement of stock prices, because the corresponding eigenvector components have the same sign and approximately

the same size. Looking at the ﬁrst and second eigenvector components (Tables III and IV) one can easily see that,
for the ME correlation matrices, the above interpretation is only partially valid, for x1 ≡ GDP, x2 ≡ Consumption,
x3 ≡ Capital Formation, w1 ≡ GDP/capita and y2 ≡ Interest Rates. The ﬂuctuations of these indicators seem to
reﬂect a global similarity, as a result of the so-called ”globalization trend”. The same result was also found in [15] for
the ﬁrst four indicators, by another method, namely measuring the mean statistical distances between countries. The
ﬁfth indicator analyzed in [15] was the Net Exports, for which no occurrence of this eﬀect was reported - in perfect
agreement with the actual results.

D. Clustering method and results

The clustering scheme can be next elaborated as follows: ﬁrstly, the so-called ﬁrst order clusters are selected using
the bipartite factor graph, i.e. meaning the clusters of countries having at least one connection to the respective
variable node. The countries are further partitioned after the sign and the magnitude of eigenvector components,
using Table IV (for x1, x2, x3, y2 and w1) and Table III (for the others). For several indicators (x1, x2 and z3) we
also selected some groups that can be called second-order clusters, including some countries which are not tied in the
factor graph, but have important contributions to the eigenvector structure i.e. large size components. These clusters
are written into parentheses in Table V.

Looking at the development indicators (x1, x2, x3, x4 and w1), we ﬁnd approximately the same clustering scheme
as reported in [15] but more extended. There is some agreement with the results reported by Chen in [5] regarding
the co-movement between real activity and prices during the period 1992-1997 i.e. the partition of FRA-DEU and
ITA into diﬀerent clusters with respect to the Consumer Price Index ﬂuctuations. Moreover there is agreement with
the MST constructed in [4] for 1996 i.e. the strong connections BEL-DEU-FRA-LUX, IRE-FIN and ESP-PRT with
respect to the GDP/capita.

IV. CONCLUDING REMARKS

Here above we have shown that short and noisy macroeconomic time series can be eﬃciently investigated by moving
a constant size time window with a constant step over the time span of interest. The statistical distances between
countries, which are calculated using the linear correlations between the datasets for each time interval, can be used for
computing the ultrametrical distance from each country to a virtual introduced one, called ”Average”. This method,
called Moving-Average-Minimal-Length-Path, results in a new set of correlation matrices between country distances
to their own mean. The new correlation coeﬃcients describe as well as possible the cross-country similarities between
the macroeconomic indicator ﬂuctuations around the average common trend.

The distribution of the absolute values of the correlation coeﬃcients is the uniform distribution. This can be an

10

eﬀect due to the relative small number of data used for computing them (see Table I), but can be also seen as reﬂecting
the diversity resulted from the large number of particular factors underling the time evolution of each ME indicator. As
well as in the biological systems, the existence of some common patterns does not exclude the idiosyncratic diversity.
The Bipartite Factor Graph connects in the simplest possible way all the countries by means of corresponding
variable nodes assimilated here to the ME indicators. In spite of its simplicity, the method requires an appropriate
choosing of the threshold value for the correlation coeﬃcients. One way of evaluating the threshold value can be the
t-Student’s test of statistical signiﬁcance, as it has been done in the previous section. We have found the threshold
value near 0.83, in a conﬁdence interval of 98 % of the correlation coeﬃcients statistical signiﬁcance.

The Bipartite Factor Graph leads to a clustering scheme in which all the countries are involved (a country can
only be tied or not tied to the respective variable). For a reliable clustering scheme, more investigation is required,
particularly concerning the tied countries. This investigation was performed in the previous section by analyzing the
correlation matrix eigensystems.

As compared with the similar investigation of stock prices clustering, there are some similarities, but also important
diﬀerences. The Random Matrix Theory could only be partially used here, except for those results valid in the limit
of inﬁnite matrices: the ﬁnite size eﬀects are much stronger here than in the stock market they are. For ﬁnding the
so-called noise band [7], we had to construct the N × N (N = 15) random matrix having all its rows and columns
uncorrelated. Its eigenvalue spectrum was plotted in Fig. 2.

The ﬁrst two eigenvalues (the largest) are far outside the noise band, thus the so called chance or noise correlation
hypothesis can be rejected. Unlike the result obtained for stocks, here the largest eigenvalues does not reﬂect always
a collective mode of the system. The few indicators for which this propriety holds, are the ones more sensitive to the
globalization phenomena.

Finally, as regards the clustering structure, some overlapping with similar results reported in the economic literature
was found. However, the clusters composition is most likely a variable from a time span to another. What is important
is the existence of the clusters themselves, as this hierarchical structure emerged in a period in which the globalization
tendencies were strong and the European common policy was generally oriented to extension and cohesion. In spite
of all convergent economic policies, the emergence of the clustering structure seems to be inherent to EU-15 system,
as well as it is inherent, perhaps, to any human community.

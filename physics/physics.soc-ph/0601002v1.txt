Abstract

The inverse statistics is the distribution of waiting times needed to achieve a pre-
deﬁned level of return obtained from (detrended) historic asset prices [1, 2]. Such a
distribution typically goes through a maximum at a time coined the optimal invest-
ment horizon, τ ∗
ρ , which deﬁnes the most likely waiting time for obtaining a given
return ρ. By considering equal positive and negative levels of return, we reported
in [2] on a quantitative gain/loss asymmetry most pronounced for short horizons.
In the present paper, the inverse statistics for 2/3 of the individual stocks presently
in the DJIA is investigated. We show that this gain/loss asymmetry established for
the DJIA surprisingly is not present in the time series of the individual stocks nor
their average. This observation points towards some kind of collective movement of
the stocks of the index (synchronization).

What drives prices? This question has been studied for centuries with quanti-
tative theories dating back at least to Bachelier [3], who proposed the random
walk hypothesis for price trajectories. In order to qualify diﬀerent pricing mod-
els etc., the ﬁnancial industry has performed many statistical studies estab-
lishing a number of stylized facts as well as benchmarking for the performance
of various ﬁnancial instruments with respect to investment returns and in its
complement, risk taking. Due to this focus on returns and risk, most ﬁnancial
studies essentially amount to measuring two-point correlations in one way or

another, most commonly by studying the distribution of returns calculated
over some pre-deﬁned ﬁxed time period ∆t [4].

In recent publications [1, 2], the present authors have proposed to “invert”
the standard return-distribution problem and instead study the probability
distribution of waiting times needed to reach a ﬁxed level of return ρ for the
ﬁrst time. This is in the literature known as the ﬁrst passage time-problem
and the solution is known analytically for a Brownian motion as the inverse
gamma (Levy) distribution p(t) =
ρ), where

Historical ﬁnancial time series such as the DJIA, SP500 and Nasdaq possess
an often close to exponential positive drift over the time scales of decades due
to the overall growth of the economy modulated with times of recession, wars
etc. Hence, one can obviously not compare directly the empirical probability
distribution for positive and negative levels of return. As the focus of the
present paper will be on such a comparison, we must ideally eliminate the
eﬀect of this drift. We have chosen to remove the drift based on the use
of wavelets, which has the advantages of being non-parametric and hence
does not depend on certain economic assumptions. This technique has been
described in detail elsewhere [1] and for the present purpose, it suﬃces to say
that this wavelet technique enables a separation of the original time series s(t)
into a short scale (detrended) time series ˜s(t) and a (long time-scale) drift term
d(t) so that s(t) = ˜s(t) + d(t). Based on ˜s(t) for some historical time period
of the DJIA, the empirical investment horizon distributions, p(τρ), needed to
obtain a pre-deﬁned return level ρ for the ﬁrst time can easily be calculated for
diﬀerent ρ’s. As ˜s(t) is stationary over time scales beyond that of the applied
wavelet (for a time larger than say 1000 days) it is straightforward to compare
positive and negative levels of return.

As the empirical logarithmic stock price process is known not to be Brownian,
we have suggested to use a generalized (shifted) inverse gamma distribution

where the reasons behind t0 are purely technical and depends on short-scale
drift due to the fact that we are using the daily close. The results so far have
been very encouraging with respect to excellent parametrization of the em-
pirical probability distributions for three major stock markets, namely DJIA,
SP500 and Nasdaq; cf. Fig. 1(a), for a ρ =
5% example using the DJIA and
ref. [5] for the others. The choice of ρ =
0.05 is such that it is suﬃciently large

For all three indices, the tail-exponent α + 1 of the distributions parameter-
ized by Eq. (1) are indistinguishable from the “random walk value” of 3/2,
which is not very surprising. What is both surprising and very interesting is
that these three major US stock markets (DJIA, SP500 and Nasdaq) exhibit
a very distinct gain/loss asymmetry, i.e., the distributions are not invariant to
a change of sign in the return ρ. Furthermore, this gain/loss asymmetry quan-
tiﬁed by the optimal investment horizon deﬁned as the peak position of the
distributions has for at least the DJIA a surprisingly simple asymptotically
power law like relationship with the return level ρ, see [2] for more details.

In order to further investigate the origin of the gain/loss asymmetry in DJIA,
we simply compare the gain and loss distributions of the DJIA with the corre-
sponding distributions for a single stocks in the DJIA as well as their average.
An obvious problem with this approach is that the stocks in the DJIA changes
with time and hence an exact correspondence between the DJIA and the sin-
gle stocks in the DJIA is impossible to obtain if one at the same time wants
good statistics. This is the trade-oﬀ, where we have put the emphasis on good
statistics. The 21 company stocks analyzed and presently in the DJIA (by the
change of April 2004) are listed in Table 1 together with their date of entry as
well as the time period of the data set analyzed. In Figs. 1(c) and (c) we show
the waiting time distributions for 2 companies in the DJIA, which are repre-
sentative for the distributions obtained for all the companies listed in Table 1.
= 0.05, the value of the optimal investment
We see that, for a return level
horizon, i.e. the position of the peak in the distribution, ranges from around
2 days to around 10 days depending on the company. More importantly, it is
clear from just looking at the ﬁgures that, within the statistical precision of
the data, the distributions are the same for both positive and negative values
of ρ. In order to further quantify this invariance with respect to the sign of
ρ, we have averaged the (company) gain and loss distributions separately in
order to obtain an average behavior for the stocks listed in Table 1. The re-
sult of this averaging process (Fig. 1(d)) is nothing less that an almost perfect
agreement between the gain and loss distributions with a peak position around
5 days for both distributions. This means that the optimal investment horizon
for the average of these selected individual stocks is approximately half that
of the loss distribution for the DJIA and approximately one fourth of that for
the gain distribution. In other words, it is twice as slow to move the DJIA
down and four times as slow to move the DJIA up compared to the average
time to move one of its stocks up or down. That market losses in general are
faster than gains must also be attributed to human psychology; people are in
general much more risk adverse than risk taking.

How can we rationalize the results we have obtained? In essence, what we
have done is to interchange the operations of averaging over the stocks in the
DJIA and calculating the inverse statistics for the stocks of this index. Since

3

the DJIA is constructed such that it covers all sectors of the economy under
the assumption that this areas are to some degree independent, it seems quite
reasonable to assume that a 5% gain/loss in the shares of say Boeing Airways
has nothing economically fundamental to do with a corresponding gain/loss in
the shares of the Coca-Cola Company especially since the data are detrended.
Since the two operations do not even approximately commute, this means that
signiﬁcant inter-stock correlations must exist even for a rather modest return
level ρ = 0.05.

There are several possible scenarios which may explain the observed behavior,
but they all amount to more or less the same thing. A down/up-turn in the
DJIA may be initiated by a down/up-turn in some particular stock in some
particular economical sector. This is followed by a down/up-turn in economi-
cally related stocks and so forth. The result is a cascade, or synchronization, of
consecutive down/up-turns in all the sectors covered by the DJIA and hence in
the DJIA itself. The initiation of this may be some more general new piece of
information, which is considered more crucial for one sector than others, but
as argued for in length in [6] it may also happen for no obvious reason what
so ever. An (rational) example would be that Intel drops signiﬁcantly due to
bad quarterly earnings in turn, by a cascade process, aﬀecting the stock price
of IBM and MicroSoft and so forth. As the index, at least from a physicist’s
point of view, can be compared to an external “ﬁeld”, movements in the index
due to a single or a few stocks can rapidly spread through most or all sectors,
if psychology in general and speciﬁcally feed-back loops are important. The
observed asymmetry then means that the “ﬁeld” is not isotropic.

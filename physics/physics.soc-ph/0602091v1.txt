We propose a model of mobile agents to construct social networks, based on a system of moving particles
by keeping track of the collisions during their permanence in the system. We reproduce not only the degree
distribution, clustering coefﬁcient and shortest path length of a large data base of empirical friendship networks
recently collected, but also some features related with their community structure. The model is completely
characterized by the collision rate and above a critical collision rate we ﬁnd the emergence of a giant cluster
in the universality class of two-dimensional percolation. Moreover, we propose possible schemes to reproduce
other networks of particular social contacts, namely sexual contacts.

Friendships among a group of people, actors working in the
same movie or co-authors of the same paper, are all examples
of systems represented as networks, whose study imprinted to
social networks an unquestionable place in the ﬁeld of com-
plex networks [1, 2]. However, the topological features of net-
works of acquaintances fundamentally differ from other net-
worked systems [2, 3]. First, they are single-scale networks
and present small-world effect [4]. Second, they are divided
into groups or communities [2]. Additionally, their evolution
process differs from standard growth models as those that gov-
ern e.g. the World Wide Web. An interesting development in
this area is given in [5] where it is proposed a simple proce-
dure of transitive linking to generate small-world networks.
While each one of the mentioned features can be reproduced
with some previous model, there is still no single model that
incorporates simultaneously dynamical evolution, clustering
and community structure.

In this Letter we show that all these characteristics can be
reproduced in a very natural way, by using standard concepts
and techniques from physical systems. Namely, we propose
an approach to dynamical networks based on a system of mo-
bile agents representing the nodes of the network. We will
show that, due to this motion, it is possible to reproduce the
main properties [1, 2] of empirical social networks, namely
the degree distribution, the clustering coefﬁcient (CC) and the
shortest path length, by choosing the same average degree
measured in the empirical networks, and adjusting only one
parameter, the density of the system. The community struc-
ture emerges naturally, without labeling a priori the commu-
nity each agent belongs to, as in previous works [6]. More-
over, this approach gives some insight to further explain the
structure of empirical networks, from a recently available
large data set of friendship networks [7] concerning 90118
students, divided among 84 schools from USA, constructed
from an In-School questionnaire. The acquaintance between
pairs of students was rigorously deﬁned. Each student was
given a paper-and-pencil questionnaire and a copy of a list
with every student in the school. The student was asked to
check if he/she participated in any of 5 activities with the
friend: like going to (his/her) house in the last seven days, or

meeting (him/her) after school to hang out or go somewhere in
the last seven days, etc. Other studies [4] have used a slightly
different deﬁnition of friendships and obtained the same kind
of degree distribution, an indication of the robustness of the
concept of friendship.

Our model comprehends N particles (agents) with radius
r moving continuously in a square shaped cell of linear size
L with periodic boundary conditions and low density ρ
≡
N/L2. One link (acquaintance) is formed whenever two
agents intercept. After each collision, each colliding agent
moves in a random direction with an updated velocity, till it
collides again acquiring a new random direction, and so forth.
In this way, the resulting movement alternates between drift
(between collisions) and diffusion (collisions). Similarly to
human communities, agents arrive and depart after a certain
time of residence, the total number of agents remaining ﬁxed
in time, which enables the system to reach a quasi-stationary
state. Initially all agents are placed randomly, with the same
velocity modulus v0 and random directions. At each time step
∆t, the position xi of agent i is updated according to

xi(t + 1) = xi(t) + vi(t)∆t.

After collisions velocity modulus of each agent, say i, is up-
dated proportionally to its degree ki, deﬁned as the number of
links connected to an agent i at time t:

vi(t)
|
|

= v0 + ¯vki(t),

where ¯v is a constant having unit of velocity and vo is the
initial velocity of the agents, corresponding to a characteristic
1/(2√2πrρvo) between collisions. We assume that
time τo
≡
i is the only intrinsic property of each agent i, initially
‘age’
randomly and homogeneously chosen from an interval [0, Tl],
and updated as

A

i(t + 1) =

i(t) + ∆t.

A

When
i = Tl, agent i leaves the system, all its links are
removed, and a new agent replaces its position with the initial
conditions stated above, namely velocity modulus v0 and an

age randomly distributed in the range [0, Tl]. Therefore the
time of permanence of an agent in the system is given by Tl

After a certain transient

the system reaches a quasi-
stationary (QS) state. Thus, the degree distribution, degree
correlations and community structure depend only on two pa-
rameters, namely ρ and Tl/τo. Figure 1a illustrates the con-
vergence towards the QS state for the average degree ¯k(t) per
agent.

In Fig. 1b we show the degree per agent

each value of Tl/τo the average degree was averaged over
different snapshots in the QS regime, yielding a non-linear
function of Tl/τo, which depends on the chosen density. An
approximate analytical treatment of this dependence can be
made and will be presented elsewhere. Further, the average
degree is a function of the average number λ of collisions dur-

lish connections within a restricted vicinity. This effect corre-
sponds to a connectivity which is short range at each snapshot
of the system. So, although our clusters are not quenched in
time the underlying problem corresponds to short range 2D
percolation. We have also explicitly calculated the correlation
length as the linear size of clusters, and conﬁrm that near the
critical point this quantity diverges with precisely the same
exponent ν obtained from the ﬁnite size scaling.

Degree correlations can be quantiﬁed by computing
Knn(k), the average degree of the nearest neighbors of a ver-
tex of degree k [3]. Figure 3b shows a good agreement of this
value between real data and model for the same networks of
Fig. 3a. Similar to other social networks the mixing is assor-
tative [2], i.e. Knn increases with k, but in contrast to net-
works with scale free degree distribution (i.e. collaboration
networks), Knn(k) for friendship networks present a cutoff
due to the rapid decay in the degree distribution.

Further, the typical community structure found in social
networks, , is also reproduced with the agent model. Here,
we use a precise deﬁnition of network community recently
proposed [8] based on the concept of k-clique community. In
Fig. 4 we plot the system of mobile agents, drawing only the
trajectories of the agents which belong to two 3-clique com-
munities, having 4 and 10 agents and sketched in Fig. 4b and
Fig. 4c respectively. Agents that form a community share a
region in space and agents with larger trajectories are respon-

4

sible for building up the community. It should be pointed out
that the agent motion in the system has not the straightforward
meaning of human motion in physical space, but may be better
related with afﬁnities among individuals.

Figure 5a shows the size distribution of 3-clique communi-
ties in a particular school (school 2) compared with the sim-
ulation for the suitable value of Tl/τ0 (see Fig. 2), while in
Fig. 5b the average over all schools is compared with the av-
erage over 10 realization of the corresponding model for each
school. In both cases, the agent model reproduces the distribu-
tion of community size observed for the empirical data, partic-
ularly the feature related with the existence of a big commu-
103
nity having a large fraction of the population, namely s
agents.

∼

In the particular case of sexual contacts it has been reported
that the degree distribution presents a power-law [9]. Figure
6 shows with triangles the cumulative degree distribution of a
sexual contact network extracted from a tracing study for HIV
tests in Colorado Springs (USA) with 250 individuals [10].
The dashed line indicates the degree distribution of a social
contact network simulated with the agent model while the
solid line is the degree distribution of a subset of contacts from
the social network. The contacts in the subset are chosen by
assigning to each agent an intrinsic property which enables
one to select from all the social contacts the ones which are
sexual. Namely, when two agents form a link, as stated be-
fore, this link is now marked as a ’sexual contact’ if the sum
of the property values of the two agents is greater than a given
threshold. These property values are assigned to the agents

with an exponential distribution and the conditional threshold
is ln N/2, following the scheme of intrinsic ﬁtness proposed
in another context by Caldarelli et. al. [11]. Interestingly, one
is able to extract from the typical distributions of social con-
tacts shown throughout the paper, power-law distributions in
QS which resemble much the ones observed in real networks
of sexual contacts.

In conclusion, we presented a novel approach to construct
contact networks, based on a system of mobile agents. For a
suitable collision rule and aging scheme we have shown that
one is able to produce quasi-stationary states which repro-
duce accurately the main statistical and topological features
observed in recent empirical social networks. The QS state of
the agent model is fully characterized by one single parame-
ter and yields a phase transition belonging to the universality
class of two-dimensional percolation. Moreover, we showed
that, by introducing an additional property labeling the abil-
ity to select a particular type of social contact, e.g. sexual
contacts, the degree distributions reduce to power-law distri-
butions as observed in real sexual networks. Summarizing,
we gave evidence that motion of the nodes is a fundamental
feature to reproduce social networks, and therefore the above
model could be important to improve the study and may serve
as a novel approach to model empirical contact networks.

Abstract

A curious observation was made that the rank statistics of scientiﬁc citation
numbers follows Zipf-Mandelbrot’s law. The same pow-like behavior is exhibited by
some simple random citation models. The observed regularity indicates not so much
the peculiar character of the underlying (complex) process, but more likely, than it
is usually assumed, its more stochastic nature.

1 Introduction

Let us begin with an explanation as to what is Zipf’s law.
If we assign
ranks to all words of some natural language according to their frequencies
in some long text (for example the Bible), then the resulting frequency-rank
distribution follows a very simple empirical law

0.1 and γ

with a
1. This was observed by G. K Zipf for many
languages long time ago [1, 2]. More modern studies [3] also conﬁrm a very
good accuracy of this rather strange regularity.

≈

≈

In his attempt to derive the Zipf’s law from the information theory,

Mandelbrot [4, 5] produced a slightly generalized version of it:

f (r) =

a
rγ

f (r) =

p1
(p2 + r)p3

,

(1)

(2)

p1, p2, p3 all being constants.

The same inverse pow-law statistical distributions were found in embar-
rassingly diﬀerent situations (For reviews see [6, 7]). In economics, it was
discovered by Pareto [8] long ago before Zipf and states that incomes of
individuals or ﬁrms are inversely proportional to their rank. In less for-
mal words [9], “most success seem to migrate to those people or companies
who already are very popular”. In demography [2, 10, 11], city sizes (pop-
ulations) also are pow-like functions of cities ranks. The same regularity
reveals itself in the distributions of areas covered by satellite cities and
villages around huge urban centers [12].

Remarkably enough, as is claimed in [13], in countries such as former
USSR and China, where natural demographic process were signiﬁcantly
distorted, city sizes do not follow Zipf’s law!

Other examples of zipﬁan behavior is encountered in chaotic dynamical
systems with multiple attractors [14], in biology [15], ecology [16], social
sciences and etc. [17].

Even the distribution of fundamental physical constants, according to

[18], follows the inverse power law!

The most recent examples of Zipf-like distributions are related to the

World Wide Web surﬁng process [19, 20].

You say that all this sounds like a joke and looks improbable? So did
I when became aware of this weird law from M. Gell-Mann’s book “The

2

Quark and the Jaguar” [21] some days ago. But here are the distribution
of ﬁrst 50 USA largest cities according to their rank [22], ﬁtted by Eq.2:

The actual values of ﬁtted parameters depend on the details of the ﬁt. I
assume (rather arbitrarily) 5% errors in data.

Maybe it is worthwhile to remember here, the old story about a young
priest who complains his father about having a very diﬃcult theme for his
ﬁrst public sermon – virgin birth.

– “Look father”, he says, “if some young girl from this town, becomes
pregnant, comes to you and says that this is because of Holy Spirit. Do
you believe it?”

The father stays silent for a while, then answers:
–”Yes, son, I do. If the baby would be born, if he would be raised and

if he would live like the Christ”.

3

So, clearly, you need more empirical evidence to accept improbable
things. Here is one more, the list of the most populated countries [23]
ﬁtted by the Mandelbrot formula (2):

Even more simple Zipﬁan a/r parameterization will work in this case fairly
well!

2 Fun with citations

But all this was known long ago. Of course it is exciting to check its
correctness personally. But more exciting is to ﬁnd whether this rule still
holds in a new area. SPIRES database provides excellent possibility to
check scientiﬁc citations against Zipf-Malderbrot’s regularity.

4

As I have been involved in this matters because of M. Gell-Mann’s book,
my ﬁrst try naturally was his citations itself. The results were encouraging:

But maybe M. Gell-Mann is not the best choice for this goal. SPIRES
is a rather novel phenomenon, and M. Gell-Mann’s many important papers
were written long before its creation. So they are purely represented in
the database. Therefore, let us try present day citation favorite E. Witten.
Here are his 160 most cited papers according to SPIRES [24] (Note once
more that the values of ﬁtted parameters may depend signiﬁcantly on the
details of the ﬁt. In this and previous case I choose √N as an estimate for
data errors, not to ascribe too much importance to data points with small
numbers of citations. In other occasions I assume 5% errors. Needless to
say, both choices are arbitrary):

5

You have probably noticed very big values of the prefactor p1. Of course
this is related to the rather big values of other two parameters. We can
understand big value of p2 parameter as follows. The data set of individual
physicist’s papers are subset of more full data about all physicists. So we
can think of p2 as being an average number of papers from other scientists
between two given papers of the physicists under consideration. Whether
right or not, this explanation gains some empirical support if we consider
top cited papers in SPIRES [25] (Review of particle physics is excluded):

6

As we see p2 is fairly small now.

At last, it is possible to ﬁnd the list of 1120 most cited physicists (not
only from the High Energy Physics) on the World Wide Web [26]. Again
104, p2 = 10.7 and p3 = 0.395
the Mandelbrot formula (2) with p1 = 3.81
gives an excellent ﬁt. Now there are too many points, making it diﬃcult
to note visually the diﬀerences between the curve and data. In the ﬁgure
that follows, we show this relative diﬀerence explicitly.

·

7

For the most bulk of data the Mandelbrot’s curve gives the precision

better than 5%!

You wonder why now p2 is relatively high? I really do not know. Maybe
the list is still incomplete for his lower rank part. In any case, if you take
104, p2 =
just the ﬁrst 100 entries from this list, the ﬁt results in p1 = 2.1
0.09, p3 = 0.271. This example also shows that actually the Mandelbrot’s
−
curve with constant p1, p2, p3 is not as good approximation as one might
judge from the above given histograms, because diﬀerent parts of data
prefer diﬀerent values of the Mandelbrot’s parameters.

·

3 Any explanation?

The general character of the Zipf-Mandelbrot’s law is hypnotizing. We
already mentioned several wildly diﬀerent areas where it was encountered.
Can it be considered as some universal law for complex systems? And if so,
what is the underlying principle which uniﬁes all of these seemingly diﬀerent

8

systems? What kind of principle can be common for natural languages,
individual wealth distribution in some society, urban development, scientiﬁc
citations, and female ﬁrst name frequencies distribution? The latter is
reproduced below [27]:

Another question is whether the Mandelbrot’s parameters p2 and p3
can tell us something about the (complex) process which triggered the
corresponding Zipf-Mandelbrot distribution. For this goal an important
issue is how to perform the ﬁt (least square, χ2, method of moments [20] or
something else?). I do not have any answer to this question now. However
let us compare the parameters for the female ﬁrst name distribution from
the above given histogram and for the male ﬁrst name distribution (data
are taken from the same source [27]). In both cases χ2 ﬁt was applied with
5% errors assumed for each point.

9

The power-counting parameter p3 is the same for both distributions,

although the p2 parameter has diﬀerent values.

If you are fascinated by a possibility that very diﬀerent complex systems
can be described by a single simple law, you maybe will be disappointed (as
was I) to learn that some simple stochastic processes can lead to very same
Zipﬁan behavior. Say, what proﬁt will you have from knowing that some
text exhibits Zipf’s regularity, if this gives you no idea the text was written
by Shakespeare or by monkey? Alas, it was shown [4, 28, 29, 30] that
random texts (“monkey languages”) exhibit Zipf’s-law-like word frequency
distribution. So Zipf’s law seems to be at least [5] “linguistically very
shallow” and [29] “is not a deep law in natural language as one might ﬁrst
have thought”.

Two diﬀerent approaches to the explanation of Zipf’s law is very well

10

summarized in G. Millers introduction to the 1965 edition of Zipf’s book [1]:
“Faced with this massive statistical regularity, you have two alternatives.
Either you can assume that it reﬂects some universal property of human
mind, or you can assume that it reﬂects some necessary consequence of
the laws of probabilities. Zipf chose the synthetic hypothesis and searched
for a principle of least eﬀort that would explain the apparent equilibrium
between uniformity and diversity in our use of words. Most others who
were subsequently attracted to the problems chose the analytic hypothesis
and searched for a probabilistic explanation. Now, thirty years later, it
seems clear that the others were right. Zipf’s curves are merely one way
to express a necessary consequence of regarding a message source as a
stochastic process”.

Were “others” indeed right? Even in the realm of linguistics the debate
is still not over after another thirty years have passed [31]. In the case of
random texts, the origin of the Zipf’s law is well understood [32, 33]. In
fact such texts exhibit no Zipﬁan distribution at all, but log-normal dis-
tribution, the latter giving in some cases a very good approximation to
the Zipf’s law. So there is no doubt that simple stochastic (Bernoulli or
Markov) processes can lead to a Zipﬁan behavior. No dynamically non-
trivial properties (interactions and interdependence) is required at all from
the underlying system. But it was also stressed in the literature [34, 13]
that this fact does not preclude more complex and realistic systems to ex-
hibit Zipﬁan behavior because of underlying nontrivial dynamics. In this
case, we can hope that the Zipf-Mandelbrot parameters will be meaningful
and can tell something about the system properties. Let us note that the
rank-frequency distribution for complex systems is not always Zipﬁan. For
example, if we consider the frequency of occurrence of letters, instead of
words, in a long text, the empirical universal behavior, valid over 100 natu-
ral languages with alphabet sizes ranged between 14 and 60, is logarithmic
[35]

f (r) = A

B ln r

−

where A and B are constants. This fact, of course, is interesting by itself.
It is argued in [35] that both regularities (zipﬁan and logarithmic) can have
the common stochastic origin.

An interesting example of Zipf-Mandelbrot’s parameters being useful
and eﬀective, is provided by ecology [36, 37]. The exponent p3 is related to
the evenness of the ecological community. It has higher values for “simple”
and lower values for “complex” systems. The parameter p2 is related to

11

the “diversity of the environment” [37] and serves as a measure of the
complexity of initial preconditions.

The another pole in explanation of Zipf’s law seeks some universal prin-
ciple behind it, such as “least eﬀort” [2], “minimum cost” [4], “minimum
energy” [38] or “equilibrium” [39]. The most impressive and, as the above
ecological example shows, fruitful explanation is given by B. Mandelbrot
[5, 40] and is based on fractals and self-similarity.

As we see, the suggested explanations are almost as numerous as the
observed manifestations of this universal pow-like behavior. This probably
indicates that some important ingredient in this regularity still escapes to
be grasped. As M. Gell-Mann concludes [21] “Zipf’s law remains essentially
unexplained”.

4 The almighty chance

If monkeys can write texts they can make citations too! So let us imagine
the following random citation model.

•

•

•

•

At the beginning there is one “seminal” paper.

Every sequential paper makes at most ten citations (or cites all pre-
ceding papers if their number does not exceed ten).

All preceding papers have an equal probability to be cited.

Multiple citations are excluded. So if some paper is selected by chance
as an citation candidate more than once, the selection is ignored (in
this case total number of citations in a new paper will be less than
ten).

I doubt about monkeys but it is simple to learn computer to simulate such
a process. Here is the result of simulation for 1000 papers.

12

So we see an apparent pow-like structure, although with staircase be-
havior. We expect this stepwise structure to disappear if we eliminate the
democracy between papers and make some papers more probable to be
cited.

Note that even the value of exponent p3 is reasonably close to what
was really observed for the most cited papers. But this can be merely an
accident and I do not like to make some farfetched conclusion about the
nature of citation process from this fact.

In reality “Success seems to attract success” [9]. Therefore, let us try to
see what happens if the equal probability axiom is changed by perhaps a
more realistic one:

•

The probability for a paper to be cited is proportional to n + 1, where
n is the present total citation number for the paper.

13

It is still assumed that all preceding papers compete to be cited by a new
paper, but with probabilities as follows from the above given law. The
result for 1000 papers now looks like

The ﬁt seems not so good now, nevertheless you can notice some resem-
blance with the case of individual scientists. Again I refrain from premature
conclusions. Although it is not entirely surprising that the well-known a
given paper of a certain author is, the more probable becomes its citation
in a new paper.

5 Discussion

So scientiﬁc citations (leaving aside ﬁrst name frequencies) provides one
more example of Zipf-Mandelbrot’s regularity. I do not know whether this

14

fact indicates only to signiﬁcant stochastic nature of the process or to some-
thing else. In any case SPIRES, and the World Wide Web in general, gives
us an excellent opportunity to study the characteristics of the complex
process of scientiﬁc citations.

I do not know either whether Mandelbrot’s parameters are meaningful
in this case, and if they can tell us something non-trivial about the citation
process.

The very generality of the Zipf-Mandelbrot’s regularity can make it
rather “shallow”. But remember, that the originality of answers on the
question of whether there is something serious behind the Zipf-Mandelbrot’s
law depends how restrictive frameworks we assume for the answer. Shallow
framework will probably guarantee shallow answers. But if we do not re-
strict our imagination from the beginning, answers can turn out to be quite
non-trivial. For example, fractals and self-similarity are certainly great and
not shallow ideas. This point is very well illustrated by the “Barometer
Story”, which I like so much that I’m tempted to reproduce it here (it is
reproduced as given in M. Gell-Mann’s book [21]).

6 The Barometer Story – by Dr. A. Calandra

Some time ago, I received a call from a colleague who asked if I would be
the referee on the grading if an examination question. It seemed that he
was about to give a student a zero for his answer to a physics question,
while the student claimed he should receive a perfect score and would do so
if the system were not set up against the student. The instructor and the
student agreed to submit this to an impartial arbiter, and I was selected...
I went to my colleague’s oﬃce and read the examination question, which
was, “Show how it is possible to determine the height of a tall building with
the aid of a barometer.”

The student’s answer was, “Take the barometer to the top of the build-
ing, attach a long rope to it, lower the barometer to the street, and then
bring it up, measuring the length of the rope. The length of the rope is the
height of the building.”

Now this is a very interesting answer, but should the student get credit
for it? I pointed out that the student really had a strong case for full credit,
since he had answered the question completely and correctly. On the other
hand, if full credit were given, it could well contribute to a high grade for
the student in his physics course. A high grade is supposed to certify that

15

the student knows some physics, but the answer to the question did not
conﬁrm this. With this in mind, I suggested that the student have another
try at answering the question. I was not surprised that my colleague agreed
to this, but I was surprised that the student did.

Acting in the terms of the agreement, I gave the student six minutes
to answer the question, with the warning that the answer should show
some knowledge of physics. At the end of ﬁve minutes, he had not written
anything. I asked if he wished to give up, since I had another class to take
care of, but he said no, he was not giving up, he had many answers to
this problem, he was just thinking of the best one. I excused myself for
interrupting him to please go on.
In the next minute, he dashed oﬀ his
answer, which was: “Take the barometer to the top of the building, and
lean over the edge of the roof. Drop the barometer, timing its fall with a
stopwatch. Then, using the formula s = at2/2, calculate the height of the
building.”

At this point, I asked my colleague if he would give up. He conceded
and I gave the student almost full credit. In leaving my colleague’s oﬃce, I
recalled that the student had said that he had other answers to the problem,
so I asked him what they were.

“Oh, yes,” said the student. “There are many ways of getting the height
of a tall building with the aid of a barometer. For example, you could take
the barometer out on a sunny day and measure the height of the barometer,
the length of its shadow, and the length of the shadow of the building, and
by the use of simple proportion, determine the height of the building.”

“Fine,” I said. “And the others?”
“Yes”, said the student. “There is a very basic measurement that you
will like. In this method, you take the barometer and begin to walk up the
stairs. As you climb the stairs, you mark oﬀ the length and this will give
you the height of the building in barometer units. A very direct method.”
“Of course, if you want a more sophisticated method, you can tie the
barometer to the end of a string, swing it as a pendulum, and determine
the value of g at the street level and at the top of the building. From the
diﬀerence between the two values of g, the height of the building can, in
principle, be calculated.”

Finally, he concluded, “If you don’t limit me to physics solution to this
problem, there are many other answers, such as taking the barometer to
the basement and knocking on the superintendent’s door. When the super-
intendent answers, you speak to him as follows:

16

Dear Mr. Superintendent, here I have a very ﬁne barometer. If you will

tell me the height of this building, I will give you this barometer ...”

1. The basic conceptions

Let us consider the movement of particles (vehicles) on multilane
road fragment. Let v be a velocity of regular movement deter-
mined by a number of particles called slow vehicles that diﬀers
suﬃciently from zero. Let d = d(v) be a dynamic distance, that
includes one lane part of a road with the length that covers the
length of vehicle and braking way (the size of discretization step
by space coordinate) [1], ﬁg. 1.

Figure 1: Discretization

The dependence d(v) can be approximated by the quadratic

relation

d(v) = c0 + c1v + c2v2
where c0 is the length of vehicle base, c1 is a coeﬃcient which is
connected with regard of driver’s reaction in case of unexpected
traﬃc condition change, c2v2 is an evaluation of braking way.
For example let us consider Tanaka model, [2]

d(v) = 5.7 + 0.14v + 0.0022v2,

(1)

1

d(v)(m), v (km/h). If in the equation (1) the velocity is mea-
sured in m/sec, then c0 = 5.7 m, c1 = 0.14 · 3.6 = 0.504 sec,
c2 = 0.0022 · (3.6)2 = 0.0285 sec2/m. In this case we have

d(v) = 5.7 + 0.504v + 0.0285v2.

(2)

The coeﬃcient c2 depends on condition of the road covering.
So, according [3], for the wet asphalt-concrete road covering the
coeﬃcient c2 is in two times larger than for dry asphalt-concrete
road covering, that is d(v) = 5.7+0.504v+0.057v2, and for a road
covered with ice d(v) = 5.7 + 0.504v + 0.165v2. Fig. 2 shows the
dependence d(v) for diﬀerent conditions of road covering. The
graph of the function d(v) for diﬀerent conditions of the road
covering is shown on ﬁg. 2.

Figure 2: Dynamic distance: d1(v) — dry asphalt; d2(v) — wet asphalt;
d3(v) — road covered with ice

Thus the immediate location of a vehicle on the road can be
shown by the cell ﬁeld, which for simplicity is synchronized in

2

relation to lanes (ﬁg. 3).

Figure 3: The three-lane cell ﬁeld

Let T be magnitude of discrete time unit, that ﬁxes ﬂow
state. If the ”snap” does not change then the ﬂow is supposed
to be steady. The ratio of the number of occupied cells to their
total number is called the regularity, r ∈ [0; 1]. If r = 1 then
we have the steady ﬂow, an army column, which presents the
movement of the column with the constant velocity v = const.
It is a consequence of busy cells. If r < 1, then the individual
transition of a vehicle to a front or neighbour cell diagonally is
possible in a time unit T (ﬁg. 4).

Figure 4: Manoeuvres on the road

These transitions are caused by several reasons but one of the
most important is that drivers want to drive their cars with a
higher velocity. Let p = p(t) be a stochastic measure of individ-
ual transitions at time unit t to the cell ahead when this cell is
empty. Of course this value also depends on other characteristics
of the ﬂow and this is the subject of the further consideration.

3

Thus each car will do an attempt to move forward with prob-
ability p(T ) independent of the behavior of the other vehicles. If
r ≈ 0 then there is no obstacle for such transitions as a rule,
and if r is essentially greater than 0 then the considered mea-
sure depends on r. Let p(r, t) be this measure. It is clear that
p(0, t) = p(T ) and p(r, t) is an non-increasing function r ∈ [0; 1],
p(1, T ) = 0.

Let us evaluate the function p(r, t). Suppose that in the neigh-
bourhood of the considered cell the states of the three neighbour
cells that follow ahead are independent (ﬁg. 5).

Figure 5: Manoeuvres from an inner cell

Thus accurate to the coeﬃcient p(T ) the probability pi(r; T )

of a transition equals

R3(r) = (1 − r) · 1 + r(2(1 − r)2 − (1 − r)4) =

= (1 − r)(1 + 2r(1 − r) − r(1 − r)3) =
= (1 − r)(1 + 2r − r2 − r + 3r2 − 3r3 + r4) =
= (1 − r)(1 + r + r2 − 3r3 + r4) =
= 1 − 4r3 + 4r4 − r5.

Similarly, for the case of inside lane on a multilane road (or on
a two-lane road), we have

R2(r) = 1 − 2r2 + r3.

4

At last for the movement on a lane (or for canalized move-

ment) we obtain

Thus

R1(r) = 1 − r.

p1(r, T ) ≃ p(T )(1 − r).
p2(r, T ) ≃ p(T )(1 − 2r2 + r3);
p3(r, T ) ≃ p(T )(1 − 4r3 + 4r4 − r5),

(ﬁg. 6).

Figure 6: Evaluation Ri(r) of dependence pi(r; T )/p(T )

In common case it can be considered that p(r; T ) is a contin-
uous function on r; (the addition of one busy cell cannot have
any essential inﬂuence upon the mean velocity).

At last in common case the considered function can be also
depend on v. Really, every driver has his own knowledge of ve-
locity. Therefore the additive component to expected velocity
(v1 > v) is compensated by individual attempts. For example
according to the next scheme we have v + d(v)p(r, T, v)/T = v1.

2. DST-ﬂows (Deterministic-stochastic traﬃc)

The regular velocity can be also considered as the determinate
component vdet of the ﬂow. Beside the collective motive of the
particle behavior in the ﬂow each particle also has its own in-
tensions. Hence the ﬂow can be presented as a composition of
total (common, socialist) and private (liberal, individual) behav-
ior. Let us consider a ﬂow which consists of the particles with
identical strategies of behavior (homogeneous dst-ﬂow,). Then
the ﬂow velocity is the sum of the deterministic and stochastic
components

vdst = vdet + vst

(3)

where the stochastic transitions are independent and distributed
equally. In this relation average meaning of individual transition
is

Hence the average value and the dispersion of the velocity is

accordingly equal to

¯vst = p(r, T, v)

d(v)
T

.

¯v = v + p(r, T, v)

d(v)
T

,

¯v2 = p(r, T, v)(1 − p(r, T, v))(

d(v)
T

)2.

Let ρ be the density of traﬃc ﬂow per lane. Then

¯ρ =

r
d(v)

.

Hence we have intensity per lane

¯q ≃ ρ × ¯v =

(v + p(r, T, v)

) =

d(v)

=

rp(r, T, v)

The function (6) depends on three variables. As

pi(r, T, v) ≃ p(0, T, v)Ri(r)

we have (i is number of lanes)

¯qi =

rv
d(v)

+

rp(0, T, v)Ri(r)
T

.

Suppose T → 0. Reassume that

p(0, T, v)
T

→ p(v).

(7)

Then

¯vst(i) = p(0, T, v)Ri(r)

= p(v)Ri(r)d(v)

and the intensity is equal to

d(v)
T

rv
d(v)

¯qi(v, p(v), r) =

+ rp(v)Ri(r).

(8)

According to (5) we receive

¯qi(ρ, v, p(v), ρ) = ρv + ρd(v)p(v)Ri(ρd(v)).

(9)

Equation (9) generalizes the classical relation (main diagram)

which is obtained for p(v) = 0.

In this case

¯vi = v + p(v)Ri(r)d(v).

3. The single-lane traﬃc ”Regularity-Velocity-
Rate”

Let us consider the case of one lane, n = 1. We have ¯vst =
p(v)(1 − r)d(v) and the equation (6) for small T can be written
as

¯q1 ≃

rv
d(v)

+ p(v)r(1 − r) = vρ + p(v)d(v)ρ(1 − d(v)ρ),

7

where ρd(v) = r ≤ 1. For ρd(v) > 1 the dynamic distance is not
regarded and for this reason v diminishes.
ρ = c0 + c1v + c2v2 we have

As d(v) = r

¯q1 ≃ ¯q1(r, v, p) =

c0 + c1v + c2v2 + pr(1 − r),

(10)

rv

where coeﬃcients c0, c1, c2 are assigned as in equation (1); p =
p(v) 1/sec.

The function ¯q1 is deﬁned on the rectangular 0 < r < 1,
0 < v < vmax. Suppose p ≡ 1. Let us represent the graph of the
intensity function (ﬁg.7).

For the same values of parameters the dependence of the

individual velocity on r and v is shown on ﬁg. 8.

Figure 7: Function ¯q1(r, v, 1) vehicle/sec

It can be seen from ﬁg. 7 that the largest ﬂow rate is reached
when the values of basic variables r and v are near by (0,8;15).
In some neighborhood of point of maximum the trajectories of

8

Figure 8: Function ¯v1(r, v, 1) m/sec

intensity level lines are close of and are included to the consid-
ered set of values. Thus the ﬂow intensity can be still invariant
when the parameters of the ﬂow change.

Comparing the behavior of graphs of the intensity and the
velocity (ﬁg. 7–8) we note that the conﬂict of the collective and
individual purposes occurs. Just, if the velocity remains constant
then the intensity changes, as the level lines intersect.

In common case we have
v
∂q1

c0 + c1v + c2v2 + p − 2rp = 0,

i.e. c0 + c1v + c − 2v2 = v(c1 + 2c2v) and c2v2 = c0. Thus

4. Stability of the traﬃc and scattering of the funda-
mental diagram

11

The considered model allows to explain the appearance on
the fundamental diagram of scattering domains of density where
diﬀerent values of intensity can correspond to the same value of
density. The existance of scattered domains has been discovered
on the basis of the experimental results, described in [4,5], ﬁg.
9–11.

If the ﬂow density ρ < ρmax/2 then the movement is stable
and the traﬃc can be described well by a hydrodynamic model.
In this case the regular movement r = 1 is a single stable state.
The eﬀect of random disturbances are short-lived and the traﬃc
return fast to the previous regime.

For suﬃciently large densities, that are out of the range of
the stability of the traﬃc, the appearances of disturbances result
in that regularity of traﬃc has values r < 1 because of reaction
of drivers on changes of the situation that gives a change of the
dynamic dimension. The density becomes a random value. Dis-
persion of the density becomes not equal to zero. The changes
of rate r/d(v) result in that values of densities, which have been
found in the experiments, has dispersion near the average value
when the intensity of the traﬃc does not change. Thus the same
value of the intensity, obtained in the experiments, can corre-
spond to diﬀerents values of densities and therefore scattered
domains on the fundamental diagram appear.

5. Multilane motion ”Regularity – velocity – intensity”

Similarly, for the case of two lanes

¯q2 = ¯q2(r, v, p) =

c0 + c1v + c2v2 + pr(1 − 2r2 + r3).

(11)

rv

we have the graphic dependences for the intensity and the ve-
locity (ﬁg. 12, 13).

14

Finally, for three lanes

¯q3 = ¯q3(r, v, p) =

c0 + c1v + c2v2 + pr(1 − 4r3 + 4r4 − r5) (12)

rv

we obtain the dependences shown on ﬁg. 14, 15.

6. Collective and individual for the ﬂows with a con-
stant density

For ﬁxed density ρ0 = r/d(v) from (12) we obtain

¯q1 = ¯q1(ρ, v, p) =

= vρ + pd(v)ρ(1 − d(v)ρ) =
= vρ + p(c0 + c1v + c2v2)ρ(1 − ρ(c0 + c1v + c2v2)) =
= d−1(r/v)ρ + pr(1 − r).

(13)

The unequality r < 1 is equivalent to unequality ρd(v) < 1,

i.e.

c0 + c1v + c2v2 <

Let us represent the evaluations of dependence (13) of inten-
sity on velocity for the ﬁxed density. The question is how the
rate changes if the ﬂow velocity changes abruptly during a small
period of time and the density is constant. If the case of one
lane is considered then for ρ0 = 0.01 vehicle/m we have the de-
pendence shown in ﬁg. 16. As for dependences, shown on ﬁg.
17–19, this dependence corresponds to the case of dry asphalt
(eq. (2)): c0 = 5.7 m/sec; c1 = 0.504 sec; c2 = 0.0285 sec/m.
Range of velocities below 25 m/sec, i.e 90 km/h, is considered.

Figure 17. Dependence ¯q1(v, p) (vehicle/sec), ρ = 0.05 (vehicle/m)

The dependence for ρ0 = 0.05 is shown on ﬁg. 14. On ﬁg.17
there is the evident unstability in the neighbourhood of the right
lower angle. For the case of the three-lane road we have depen-
dences shown on ﬁg.18-19.

7. Inﬂuence of ”blue lights” upon the ﬂow rate

The particles of the two types characterized by of the diﬀerent
functions of dynamic distances d1(v) and d2(v) are considered.
Suppose d2(v) < d1(v) for each allowed v. If v is the regular
velocity of the unmixed ﬂow with zero individual velocity of the
unmixed ﬂow, then by mixing between two large particles small
particle would emerge (percolation). Hence the ﬂow velocity
can be evaluated as v1(v) = d−1
1 (d1(v)/(2)). Let us suppose still
that the number of such particles is rather small. That the ﬂow
intensity in the new conditions is

ρv1(v) + ρ

p(ρd(v)/2), T )
T

(d(v)/2),

where the function p(r, T ) is deﬁned as the function p(r, T ) intro-
duced in section 1; dynamic distance d(v) is calculated according
equation (2).

The value v1(v), which satisﬁes equation d(v1(v)) = d(v)

that

is equation

c0 + c1v1(v) + c2v2

1(v) =

,

exists only in the case

c1v + c2v2 ≥ c0.

Suppose also

Suppose that

p(v)d(v)/2 = v − v1(v).

Hence

As

qi(ρ, v) = ρ (v1(v) + (v − v1(v))Ri(ρd(v)/2)) .

For example, if i = 1 we have

q1(ρ, v) = ρ(v1(v) + (v − v1(v))(1 − ρd1(v)/2)).

.

Relative variation of ﬂow rate of slow particles in case of
small number of fast special vehicles is shown on ﬁg. 20. We
still suppose that c0 = 5.7 m/sec; c1 = 0.504 sec; c2 = 0.0285
sec/m.

Many social and biological networks consist of communities - groups of nodes within which connec-

tions are dense, but between which connections are sparser. Recently, there has been considerable

interest in designing algorithms for detecting community structures in real-world complex networks.

In this paper, we propose an evolving network model which exhibits community structure. The

network model is based on the inner-community preferential attachment and inter-community pref-

erential attachment mechanisms. The degree distributions of this network model are analyzed based

on a mean-ﬁeld method. Theoretical results and numerical simulations indicate that this network

model has community structure and scale-free properties.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Complex networks are currently being studied across many ﬁelds of science and engineering [1], stimulated by the

fact that many systems in nature can be described by models of complex networks. A complex network is a large

set of interconnected nodes, in which a node is a fundamental unit usually with speciﬁc dynamical or information

content. Examples include the Internet, which is a complex network of routers and computers connected by various

physical or wireless links; the World Wide Web, which is an enormous virtual network of web sites connected by

hyperlinks; and various communication networks, food webs, biological neural networks, electrical power grids, social

and economic relations, coauthorship and citation networks of scientists, cellular and metabolic networks, etc. The

ubiquity of various real and artiﬁcial networks naturally motivates the current intensive study of complex networks,

on both theoretical and application levels.

Many properties of complex networks have currently been reported in the literature. Notably, it is found that many

complex networks show the small-world property [2], which implies that a network has a high degree of clustering as

in some regular network and a small average distance between nodes as in a random network. Another signiﬁcant

recent discovery is the observation that many large-scale complex networks are scale-free. This means that the degree

distributions of these complex networks follow a power law form P (k) ∼ k−γ for large network size, where P (k) is

the probability that a node in the network is connected to k other nodes and γ is a positive real number determined

by the given network. Since power laws are free of characteristic scale, such networks are called “scale-free networks”

[3]. The scale-free nature of many real-world networks can be generated by a mechanism of growing with preferential

attachment [3].

Communities are deﬁned as collections of nodes within which connections are dense, but between which connections

are sparser. There are many real-world networks which exhibit community structure, and community structures are

supposed to play an important role in many real networks. For example, communities in a citation network might

represent related papers on a single topic [4]; communities on the web might represent pages on related topics [5];

communities in a biochemical network or neuronal system might correspond to functional units of some kinds [6, 7];

communities also play an important role in information networks [8]. There have been several investigations into

designing algorithms for detecting community structure in large-scale complex networks [9-10]. To study the eﬀects of

community structure on network properties and dynamics, the modelling of real networks with community structure

is very important. However, most of the existing evolving network models do not take the community structure into

account. In [11], a networked seceder model was proposed to illustrate group formation in social networks. In [12], a

bipartite growing network model for social community with group structures was proposed. In [13], a social network

model based on social distance attachment was proposed, which can exhibit community structure. In [14], the authors

proposed a growing network model with community structure. However, there is the possibility within the network

model that a node belongs to a community but has no connections with nodes in this community but has connections

with nodes in other communities, which is unacceptable.

In this paper, we propose an evolving network model with community structure based on the inner-community

preferential attachment and inter-community preferential attachment mechanics. We use a mean-ﬁeld method to

analyze the degree distributions of this network model. Numerical simulations are also performed to investigate the

properties of this network model. Some more realistic generalizations and extensions are also discussed in the the

Conclusions and Remarks Section.

II. NETWORK MODEL

In this section, we describe the growing mechanics of the proposed network model. For simplicity, we consider only

undirected network models in this paper. We assume there is a total of M (M ≥ 2) communities in the network. The

proposed model is deﬁned by the following scheme:

Step 1 - Initialization: Start from a small number m0 (m0 > 1) of fully connected nodes in each community.

Use M(M−1)

2

inter-community links to connect each community to the other M − 1 communities, so that there is a

link between each community. The nodes to which the inter-community links connect are selected randomly in each

community. For example, Fig. 1 shows an initial network with M = 3 and m0 = 3.

Inner-community link
Inner-community link

Inter-community link
Inter-community link

FIG. 1: An initial network example with M = 3, m0 = 3

Step 2 - Growth: At each time step, a new node is added to a randomly selected community. The new node will

be connected to m (1 ≤ m ≤ m0) nodes in the same community through m inner-community links (deﬁned as the

links that connect nodes in the same community), and with probability α connected to n (1 ≤ n ≤ m) nodes (none

with probability 1 − α) in the other M − 1 communities through inter-community links (deﬁned as the links that

connect nodes among diﬀerent communities).

Step 3 - Preferential Attachments:

a) Inner-community preferential attachment: When choosing nodes in the same community (we denote it as the

jth community) to which the new node connects through inner-community links, we assume that the probability Π

that a new node will be connected to node i in community j depends on the inner-degree sij (deﬁned as the number

of inner-links connected to node i) of that node, such that

P
b) Inter-community preferential attachment: When choosing the nodes in other communities to which the new node

connects through inter-community links, we assume that the probability Π that a new node will be connected to node

i in community k(k 6= j) depends on the inter-degree lik (deﬁned as the number of inter-links connected to the node),

such that

The motivation for using the inner-community preferential attachment mechanics is the same as that in many other

growing network models. There also exist inter-community preferential attachment phenomena in some real networks

with community structure. For example, in scientiﬁc collaboration networks, a multidisciplinary researcher is more

likely to be willing to study other unknown ﬁelds to him/her, and has stronger desire to collaborate with researchers

in other ﬁelds than other single-topic researchers. In friendship networks, an individual with many inter-community

links is more likely to make friends with diﬀerent kinds of people, and has higher probability of making new friends

with people in other communities than other people with less inter-community links. These are all inter-community

After t time steps, this scheme generates a network with M m0 + t nodes, and [M m0(m0 − 1) + M (M − 1)]/2 +

preferential attachment phenomena.

inter- and inner-community links.

We performed a numerical simulation with a total of N = 90 nodes, m0 = m = 3, n = 1 and the probability α = 0.1,

that is, at each time step, we connect a new node with 3 nodes in a selected community and with probability α = 0.1

connect it to a node in another community. For the purposes of clarity, the generated network is shown in Fig. 2, in

which nodes in each community are randomly placed. As we can see, the network generated by the proposed scheme

exhibits community structure. A detailed study of the properties of this network model will be presented in the next

section.

III. NETWORK PROPERTIES

In this section, ﬁrstly we analytically calculate the degree distribution P (k), which is deﬁned as the probability that

a randomly selected node has degree k (a node has k connections), and then we numerically study some properties of

We use a mean-ﬁeld method [15] to analyze the scaling property of the network model. Firstly we analyze the

inner-degree distribution, and then extend the results to that of the inter-degree and the total degree (deﬁned as

the sum of the inner-degree and inter-degree). Similar to [15], we assume sij is continuous, and thus the probability

Π(sij ) = sij/

The solution of this equation, with the initial condition that node i in community j was added to the system at

Using (5), the probability that a vertex has a connectivity sij(t) smaller than k can be written as

Assuming that we add the nodes (including the initial nodes) at equal time intervals to the network, the probability

density of ti is

Because αn < m (usually αn ≪ m), from (5) and (14) (or (12)) we know that the inter-degrees of network nodes

are smaller than the inner-degrees of network nodes in the sense of statistics. So, networks generated by this model

will have community structure.

Next, we numerically study the properties of the network model. We consider a network generated by the proposed

scheme with M = 3, m0 = 3, m = 3, α = 0.3, n = 1 and N = 3000. In the ﬁgures 3-5, the slopes of the lines were

obtained by cumulative distributions of 10 runs. The inner-degree distribution of this network is shown in Fig. 3. As

we can see, the inner-degree obeys a power-law distribution P (k) ∼ k−γ with γ ≈ 3 (the slope of the line is -3). The

inter-degree distribution is shown in Fig. 4, and the inner-degree obeys a power-law distribution P (k) ∼ k−γ with

γ ≈ 2.9 (the slope of the line is -2.9). The total degree distribution is shown in Fig. 5, and we observe that the total

degree also obeys a power-law distribution P (k) ∼ k−γ with γ ≈ 3. So, all these three distributions are of power-law

type, indicating that the generated network is a scale-free network, and these distributions verify the above analytical

results. In Fig. 6 we plot the time evolution of the total degree of two nodes, in which one is an initial node and the

other one is added to the network at t = 60. This is in good agreement with (16).

gradient 0.5.

We also calculated the diameter D, the average path length l and the clustering coeﬃcient C for this network. The

detailed deﬁnitions of these parameters can be found in [1]. The values of these parameters are D = 7, l = 4.0274

and C = 0.0270, respectively. So the network has small average path length and relatively large clustering coeﬃcient

(compared to a random graph).

IV. CONCLUSIONS AND REMARKS

In this paper we proposed an evolving network model with community structure. We have theoretically analyzed

the scaling properties of the network by using a mean-ﬁeld approach. The analytical and numerical results indicate

that the network can produce community structure, and the inner-degree, inter-degree and total degree all obey

9

power-law distributions, so the network has scale-free properties. The network also has small average path length

and relatively large clustering coeﬃcient (compared to a random graph). Note that in [16] the authors proposed a

growing network model of two coupled networks, which idea is a little similar to that in the present paper, but the

authors didn’t consider community structure.

To make our model more understandable and to avoid unnecessarily complicated notations, we made some simpli-

ﬁcations in our model. Some more realistic cases and extensions can be considered with minor modiﬁcation of our

model, for example:

1. We didn’t consider the formation of new communities during the evolution of the network model. In some real

world networks, some new communities may appear during the evolution. With minor modiﬁcation, our model

could allow from time to time the introduction of new communities: if a node i is the ﬁrst of a new community,

one could only set links between i and the old communities at the time step of its introduction, and follow the

same evolving rules in the proceeding time steps as deﬁned in Section 2. It is easy to show that, with this

modiﬁcation, the main results will not change.

2. In the preferential attachment mechanism, if a node i is not connected to a node j (in the same community

or diﬀerent communities) at the beginning of its introduction, it will never be.

In considering the resulting

networks, this is of no problem, but in considering the evolution process, it is somewhat unrealistic. WE can

overcome this problem, as follows: in each time step, besides the Steps mentioned in Section 2, with probability

β, an existing node is selected, and we perform the same inner- and inter- community attachments of this node

to all the other existing nodes that have no links with it. This will surely not change the community structure

of the network model.

Future extensions of this work include considering other kinds of inner- and inter- linking mechanisms other than

preferential attachment, such as preferential linking [17] and distance preference [18]. Future extensions also include

the modelling of directed and weighted network models with community structure [19], because many real-world

networks with community structures are directed and/or weighted [20]. Based on this network model, we can study

the eﬀects of community structure on network dynamics, such as the stability, synchronization, disease and rumor

spreading, and robustness. We can also introduce diﬀerent types of dynamical node models in diﬀerent communities

to study the dynamical behavior of some real networks, for example biochemical networks and brain networks.

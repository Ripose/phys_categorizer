We show that airplane boarding can be asymptotically modeled by 2-dimensional Lorentzian
geometry. Boarding time is given by the maximal proper time among curves in the model. Discrep-
ancies between the model and simulation results are closely related to random matrix theory. We
then show how such models can be used to explain why some commonly practiced airline boarding
policies are ineﬀective and even detrimental.

Airplane boarding is a process experienced daily by
millions of passengers worldwide. Airlines have devel-
oped various strategies in the hope of shortening board-
ing time, typically leading to announcements of the form
“passengers from rows 40 and above are now welcome
to board the plane”, often heard around airport termi-
nals. We will show how the airplane boarding process
can be asymptotically modeled by spacetime geometry.
The discrepancies between the asymptotic analysis and
ﬁnite population results will be shown to be closely re-
lated to random matrix theory (RMT). Previously, air-
plane boarding has only been analyzed via discrete event
simulations [1, 2, 3].

We model the boarding process as follows: Passen-
gers 1, ..., N are represented by coordinates Xi = (qi, ri),
where qi is the index of the passenger along the board-
ing queue (1st, 2nd, 3rd and so on), and r is his/her
[0, 1].
assigned row number. We rescale (q, r) to [0, 1]
It is assumed that the main cause of delay in airplane
boarding is the time it takes passengers to organize their
luggage and seat themselves once they have arrived at
their assigned row. The input parameters for our model
are:

×

u – Average amount of aisle length occupied by a pas-

senger.

w – Distance between successive rows.
b – Number of passengers per row.
D – Amount of time (delay) it takes a passenger to
clear the aisle, once he has arrived at his designated row.
p(q, r) – The joint distribution of a passenger’s row
and queue joining time. p(q, r) is directly aﬀected by the
airline policy and the way passengers react to the policy.
For the purposes of presentation, we shall assume that
u, w, b, D are all ﬁxed. The airplane boarding process
produces a natural partial order relation of blocking
among passengers. Passenger X blocks passenger Y if it is
impossible for passenger Y to reach his assigned row be-
fore passenger X (and others blocked by X) has sat down
and cleared the aisle. Airplane boarding functions as a
peeling process for the partial order deﬁned by the block-
ing relation. At ﬁrst, passengers who are not blocked by
others sit down; these passengers are the minimal ele-
ments under the blocking relation. In the second round,

passengers who are not blocked by passengers other than
those of the ﬁrst round are seated, and so forth. Board-
ing time thus coincides with the size of the longest chain
in the partial order.

We assign to the boarding process with parameters
u, b, w, D, p(q, r) a Lorentz metric deﬁned on the (q, r)
unit square by

ds2 = 4D2p(q, r)(dqdr + kα(q, r)dq2),

r p(q, z)dz. There are
where k = bu/w and α(q, r) =
two properties of the metric which relate it to the board-
ing process:

R

•

•

The volume form of the metric is proportional to
the passenger density distribution p(q, r).

The blocking partial order among passengers dur-
ing the boarding process asymptotically coincides
with the past-future causal relation induced by the
metric on the passengers, viewed as events in space-
time via their q, r coordinate representation.

To establish the second property, consider passengers
represented by X = (q, r) and X ′ = (q + dq, r + dr),
dq > 0. Consider the time passenger X arrives at his des-
ignated row. All passengers with row numbers beyond r,
who are behind X in the queue but in front of X ′, will
occupy aisle space behind X. The number of such passen-
gers is roughly N αdq. Each such passenger occupies u/w
units of aisle length, where we take the basic aisle length
unit to be the distance between rows. The row diﬀer-
ence between X and X ′ is
(N/b)dr. We conclude that
−
passenger X is blocking passenger X ′, via the passen-
gers which are behind him, roughly when dq

a condition which coincides (together with dq > 0) with
the causal relation induced by the metric. By the two
main properties we may approximate asymptotically the
airplane boarding process by the peeling process applied
to the past-future causal relation on points in the as-
sociated spacetime, sampled with respect to the volume
form. By a well-known result, 2-dimensional Lorentzian
metrics are conformally ﬂat, and hence, after an appro-
priate coordinate transformation, we may assume that

over ds) of a timelike trajectory ending at X = (q, r) and

curve deﬁned by the equation T (X) = τ .
Using the analysis of the size of maximal increasing sub-
sequences given in [6, 7], the two basic properties lead to
the following modeling statements.

−

(A) The boarding time of passenger Xi is approxi-
mately √N T (Xi). In particular, the total boarding time
is approximately √N d, where d = M axX T (X) is the
maximal proper time of a curve in the unit square with
respect to the Lorentzian metric.

(B) Let N (τ ) be the number of passengers with board-
ing time at most √N τ and ˜N (τ ) = N (τ )/N . Then,
d ˜N (τ ) = 1

2D L(τ )dτ .

Here the word ”approximately” is used to mean that
the ratio between the two quantities tends to 1 with prob-
ability 1 as the number of passengers N tends to inﬁnity.
We apply statement (A) to the analysis of boarding
times. Consider ﬁrst the case where the airline does not
have a boarding policy, namely, passengers queue at uni-
formly random times, so that p(q, r) = 1, α = 1
r and
the corresponding metric is

ds2 = 4dq(dr + k(1

We use this model to study the eﬀect of airplane design
parameters such as the distance between rows and the
number of passengers per row on boarding time. These
parameters aﬀect boarding time through the parameter
k = ub
w . To ﬁnd the maximal proper time curve, we solve
the Euler-Lagrange equation for proper time subject to
the constraints of lying in the unit square. In ﬁgure 1 the
maximal proper time curve is plotted for several values
of the parameter k. For k
ln 2 the curve is contained

in the interior of the square and is therefore a geodesic.
The length of the curve is

For k > ln 2 the maximal curve “crawls” at ﬁrst along

derivative at B. We have

We compared the above computations with simulations
of the boarding process.
In Figures 1 and 2 we show,
for k = 0.5 and k = 5, the computed maximal curve
along with maximal chains obtained from simulations
with N = 100, N = 200 and N = 106. As can be
seen from the ﬁgures, when N = 106, the longest chain
clusters along the computed curves. The length of the
maximal chain also matches well the estimated values de-
rived from the spacetime model. For k = 0.5 the length
of the maximal chain in the simulation was 2261, while
the estimated value is 2278, while for k = 5 the corre-
sponding values were 4589 and 4740, respectively. For the
more realistic values of N = 100, 200 passengers, there
are substantial deviations of the maximal chain from the
expected curve. Table II presents the average boarding
time results for 1000 simulations of the boarding pro-
cess for several settings of k and N . We also provide
the boarding time estimate computed via the spacetime
model. Upon inspection, Table II shows that, for realis-
tic values of N , there are substantial diﬀerences in the
range of 20-60 percent between the asymptotic board-

and the boarding time computed via simulations of the

the large deviations of the maximal chains from the ex-
pected curves as seen in Figures 1 and 2.

We also note that in all cases the Lorentzian estimate

is larger.

Let LN be the random variable representing the board-
ing time according to the boarding process model (the
simulation results). We deﬁne the discrepancy random
√N d(k), which measures the diﬀer-
variable ∆N = LN −
ence between the boarding time and the Lorentzian esti-
mate. The curvature of the metric given in (3) vanishes,
and therefore we can apply a coordinate transformation
W which changes the metric to the form

As noted previously, in this case past-future causal chains
correspond to increasing sequences of points. We also
note that, since the spacetime points are sampled accord-
ing to the volume form, they are uniformly distributed.
The discrepancy ∆N has been studied in the context of
increasing subsequences of uniformly distributed points
in a rectangle with sides parallel to the coordinate axis
[8], and for a right angle triangle with sides parallel to
the coordinate axis [9]. In both cases, the discrepancy
has order of magnitude N 1/6.
In the case of the rect-
angle the normalized discrepancy ∆N
N 1/6 is given asymp-
totically by the Tracy-Widom distribution F2 [10], which
measures the normalized discrepancy of the largest eigen-
value of an N
N matrix in the Gaussian unitary en-
semble (GUE) [11], in comparison with 2√N . For N/2
uniformly distributed points in a right angle triangle with
sides parallel to the axis, the normalized discrepancy is
given asymptotically by the Tracy-Widom Distribution
F4 [10], which is the normalized discrepancy of the largest
eigenvalue in the Gaussian symplectic ensemble (GSE).
The averages for these distributions are E(F2) =
1.77
and E(F4) =

The spacetime metrics given by (1) can be used for
comparing diﬀerent boarding policies. Boarding policies
such as “passengers from row 40 and above board ﬁrst,
followed by the rest of the passengers” eﬀect the passen-
ger distribution function p(q, r). We compared the results
of the spacetime computations (without ﬁner asymptotic
corrections) with the results of detailed event driven sim-
ulations of boarding processes [2, 3], which compare dif-
ferent boarding policies. We computed spacetime based
estimated boarding times for 25 diﬀerent boarding poli-
cies with parameter k = 4. Results based on detailed
trace driven simulations for the same policies are re-
ported in [2]. A comparison of the results shows that

dτ 2 = 4dxdy.

the spacetime estimates are in almost complete agree-
ment with the trace driven simulation results regarding
the ranking of the diﬀerent policies. The correlation fac-
tor between the 25-dimensional boarding time vectors is
0.97. This is somewhat surprising given that the trace
driven simulations in [2] take into account many details
of actual boarding processes which are not considered by
our boarding process simulation. These include, among
others, walking speed of passengers, passengers sitting
at the wrong row and full overhead bins. The large dis-
crepancies noted previously between the boarding simu-
lation and the spacetime estimates are less of a factor,
since when comparing boarding strategies only ratios of
boarding times matter and these are less aﬀected by the
discrepancies. The main ﬁndings regarding actual board-
ing policies are:

- The commonly practiced back-to-front boarding poli-
cies, which attempt to board passengers from the back
of the airplane ﬁrst, are ineﬀective for realistic values of
3 < k < 5. The intuition behind this statement can
be seen by the following simple reasoning. Assume the
airline is perfectly successful in enforcing back-to-front
boarding and thus passengers from the last row m board
ﬁrst, followed by the passengers from row m
1 and so
on. If k < 1, then passengers from all rows can sit con-
currently without interference since they do not block
each other. If k > 1 then the passengers in row m
1
have to wait until at least some of the passengers from
row m have sat down, and similarly passengers from row
m
j to
1 have to wait for passengers from row m
sit. This leads to a linear sized chain of blocking, which is
much larger than the √N -sized chains in random board-
ing.

- Among row dependent policies which do not severely
constrain passengers, random boarding (no policy) is al-

4

most optimal.

- One can improve any row dependent boarding policy
(including random) by ﬁrst allowing window seat passen-
gers to board, followed by middle seat and ﬁnally aisle
passengers. Such policies lower the delay parameter D,
which aﬀects the metric via scaling.

There are other discrete random processes which can
be modeled via 2-dimensional Lorentzian geometry in a
similar manner. One example of interest is the Polynu-
clear growth (PNG) model, which is a particularly simple
(1 + 1)-dimensional growth process [13, 14]. The con-
struction of the present paper can be considered as gen-
eralizing the mapping of Prahofer and Spohn [13] of the
basic PNG model to permutations. In this mapping the
height of the PNG droplet corresponds to the length of
the longest increasing subsequence in a random permuta-
tion. In terms of the airplane boarding process this cor-
responds to setting k = 0. More generally the methods of
this paper provide a description of the macroscopic shape
of a PNG droplet in an environment with non-uniform
nucleation rates and lateral speeds.

A diﬀerent example is the process of scheduling I/O

requests to a disk drive [15, 16].

In conclusion, we have shown that the airplane board-
ing process can be asymptotically modeled by a boarding
parameter dependent two dimensional spacetime. The
model can be used to analyze the dependence of boarding
times on the various boarding parameters and boarding
policies. The discrepancy between the asymptotic model
and ﬁnite population results is closely related to RMT,
at least for thin passengers. The analysis carries appli-
cations to the design of good airplane boarding policies.

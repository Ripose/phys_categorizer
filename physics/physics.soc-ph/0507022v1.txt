APPLICATIONS OF PHYSICS
TO FINANCE AND ECONOMICS:
RETURNS, TRADING ACTIVITY AND INCOME∗

A. Christian Silva†
Department of Physics, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, 20742

Abstract: This dissertation reports work where physics methods are applied to ﬁnancial and economical
problems. Some material in this thesis is based on 3 published papers [1, 2, 3] which divide this study into two
parts. The ﬁrst part studies stock market data (chapter 1 to 5). The second part is devoted to personal income in
the USA (chapter 6).

We ﬁrst study the probability distribution of stock returns at mesoscopic time lags (return horizons) ranging
from about an hour to about a month. While at shorter microscopic time lags the distribution has power-law
tails, for mesoscopic times the bulk of the distribution (more than 99% of the probability) follows an exponential
law. The slope of the exponential function is determined by the variance of returns, which increases propor-
tionally to the time lag. At longer times, the exponential law continuously evolves into Gaussian distribution.
The exponential-to-Gaussian crossover is well described by the analytical solution of the Heston model with
stochastic volatility.

85% of the stock returns for intraday time lags that start at

After characterizing the stock returns at mesoscopic time lags, we study the subordination hypothesis with one
year of intraday data. We verify that the integrated volatility Vt constructed from the number of trades process
can be used as a subordinator for a driftless Brownian motion. This subordination will be able to describe
1 hour but are shorter than one day (upper time
≈
limit is restricted by the short data span of one year). We also show that the Heston model can be constructed by
subordinating a Brownian motion with the CIR process. Finally, we show that the CIR process describes well
enough the empirical Vt process, such that the corresponding Heston model is able to describe the log-returns
xt process, with approximately the maximum quality that the subordination allows (80%

85%).

≈

Finally, we study the time evolution of the personal income distribution. We ﬁnd that the personal income
distribution in the USA has a well-deﬁned two-income-class structure. The majority of population (97–99%)
belongs to the lower income class characterized by the exponential Boltzmann-Gibbs (“thermal”) distribution,
whereas the higher income class (1–3% of population) has a Pareto power-law (“superthermal”) distribution.
By analyzing income data for 1983–2001, we show that the “thermal” part is stationary in time, save for a
gradual increase of the effective temperature, whereas the “superthermal” tail swells and shrinks following the
stock market. We discuss the concept of equilibrium inequality in a society, based on the principle of maximal
entropy, and quantitatively show that it applies to the majority of population.

INTRODUCTION

The interest of physicists in interdisciplinary research has
been constantly growing and the area of what is today named
socio-economical physics is 10 years old [4]. This new area
in physics has started as an exercise in statistical mechan-
ics, where complex behavior arises from relatively simple
rules due to the interaction of a large number components.

2

The pioneering work in the modern stream of economical
physics was initiated by Mantegna [5] and Li [6] in the early
nineties followed most notably by Mantegna and Stanley [7]
and thereafter by a stream of papers [8] that attempt to iden-
tify and characterize universal and non-universal features in
economical data in general. This statistical mechanical mind
frame arises in direct analogy with statistical mechanics of
phase transitions, where materials (such as a ferromagnetic
and a liquid), that are different in nature, can belong to the
same universality class due to their behavior near the crit-
ical point (point at which abruptly the phase changes, say
from liquid to solid in water, for instance). These univer-
sality classes are identiﬁed by critical exponents for quanti-
ties that diverge at the critical point, for instance the speciﬁc
ǫ−α, where ǫ is the reduced temperature and α
heat C
the critical exponent [9]. Therefore, the area of economical
physics has grown from, and it is still in great part concerned
with, “power-law tails” with universal exponents. This consti-
tutes the empirical stream of socio-economical physics, where
modelling and characterizing the empirical data with methods
and tools borrowed from traditional physical problems is at-
tempted [15, 16, 17, 18].

≈

Soon after Mantegna and Li initiated the modern empirical
stream of economical physics, simulations appeared. Once
again, as in the case of empirical work, these were based into
fundamental statistical mechanical models such as the Ising
model. This literature attempted to construct from simple
rules complex behavior that could then mimic the market and
explain the price formation mechanism [10, 11, 12, 13, 14].

This dissertation belongs to the empirical stream of socio-
economical physics. We study here two distinct problems.
First, we use daily and intraday stock data to describe the
essential nature of the stochastic process of price returns at
different time ranges. Second, we use yearly income data to
study the time evolution of the distribution of income in the
USA.

A. Stock returns

The study of stock returns has a long history dating back
to Bachalier in 1900, which was the ﬁrst to model stock
dynamics with a Brownian motion [19]. He proposed that
ST −t, where t is
the absolute price change ∆St = ST −
the return horizon, should follow a Gaussian random walk.
The clear drawback of such a hypothesis is that the prices
of stocks could become negative.
It was apparently Ren-
ery [19, 20, 21], who introduced the geometrical Brown-
ian motion for the stock price by assuming that log-returns
∆St/St), and not absolute
(xt = ln(ST )
≈
returns, should follow a Brownian motion. The geometric
Brownian motion became popular and accepted as a main
stream idea with the work of Osborne [22] (see also [19] for
historical notes) and Samuelson (cited in [19]).

ln(ST −t)

−

It was not until the 1960’s, that the hypothesis of Gaussian
random walks was challenged by Mandelbrot [23] and Fama
[24, 25] with studies on daily cotton prices. Since then, Brow-
nian motion has been consistently questioned for a variety of

assets. Today asset log-returns that follow Brownian motion
for all return horizons t are considered an exception.

In his pioneering work, Mandelbrot introduced, as an alter-
native model for stock returns, the stable L´evy distribution.
This distribution has the drawback that it can present inﬁnite
variance. Despite the unwanted mathematical properties that
such a process presents, it was not founded into economical
reasoning. In 1973 Clark [26] proposed, as an alternative to
Mandelbrot’s model, to use subordination [27] to construct the
distribution of assets returns. Subordination has a direct ﬁnan-
cial implication, it can be liked with ﬁnancial information ar-
rival. Clark suggests that prices react to ﬁnancial information
and that if this ﬁnancial information is taken into account, the
gaussian random walk is recovered. He showed that the infor-
mation arrival can be captured by volume of trades and that if
one takes returns conditional on the volume, these should be
Gaussian.

Note that in fact, Mandelbrot and Clark do not contradict
themselves, as Clark ﬁrst implied. Mandelbrot’s L´evy sta-
ble distribution can also be constructed by subordination, if
one chooses the right subordinator for the Brownian motion.
Therefore, the problem is reduced to ﬁnding the right subor-
dinator if one accepts the subordination hypothesis.

In physics, the concept of subordination can be found in
the construction of non-Shannon entropies, in the limit of the
continuous-time random walk, in interface growth models and
other statistical mechanical problems [28, 29, 30, 31, 32]. The
mathematical- “physical” idea of subordination is that if the
stochastic process is analyzed at the correct reference frame,
it will always look like a simple gaussian diffusion. But since
we are dealing with stochastic processes, the reference frame
is moving randomly as well; just enough for the actual process
in observation to be described by Brownian motion. For fur-
ther mathematical development of subordination, see section
V C.

After Clark, the concept of subordination has been exten-
sively used to construct asset return models [33, 34, 35, 36].
Most recently a series of studies have used high-frequency
data to verify Clark’s subordination hypothesis by either as-
suming that the volume [38, 39] or the trading activity (num-
ber of trades) [40, 41] is responsible for price changes. Strong
evidence is found for both; nonetheless number of trades ap-
pears better suited, since it has been extensively tested for a
large number of companies [41].

Contemporary to Clark, a series of empirical studies indi-
cated that the variance (variance = volatility2) of stock re-
turns is not constant (see [43] and references therein). This
resulted in models for stock returns such as Engle’s ARCH
and Bollerslev’s GARCH that attempted to account for the
changing variance in the assets returns by modelling both in
a discrete framework [44]. At the same time, models with
stochastic volatility were introduced. These models gener-
ally assume a mean reverting continuous stochastic differen-
tial equation for the volatility [45, 46, 48, 67]. Notice that
stochastic volatility models, GARCH and subordination, are
not entirely orthogonal to each other. Stochastic volatility
models can also be constructed by subordination [37] (see also
section V C) or as limits of discrete GARCH type models [47].

that

In 1993 Heston [48] introduced an exactly solvable stochas-
tic volatility model
is also a limit process for the
GARCH(1,1) model [47]. The Heston model become widely
used for option pricing and in the study of asset returns. We
use a modiﬁed version of the Heston model as developed in
Ref. [49] to describe the general shape of probability density
distribution (PDF) for the log-returns and the time evolution
of such PDF.

B. Outline of the dissertation

The outline of this thesis is as follows. In chapter II, we
introduce the Heston model for stock returns as developed
in Refs.
[2, 49]. We summarize the procedure for ﬁnding
the closed form solution of the probability distribution for the
log-returns, starting from the correlated stochastic differential
equations as given in Ref. [49]. We also introduce subordi-
nation and show how to construct the Heston model using a
Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) subordinator [71].

In chapter III, we present the data we use in this thesis.
We show the typical features of the stock data and how we
constructed such data.

In chapter IV, we study the time evolution of the empiri-
cal distribution function (EDF) for the stock returns at meso-
scopic time lags t (1 hour < t < 20 days). We show that in
the short-time limit t << 1/γ, the EDF progressively tends to
the double exponential distribution and for the long-time limit
t >> 1/γ, the EDFs progressively tends towards a Gaussian,
where 1/γ is the characteristic time for such limits. Further-
more, we show that the Heston model introduced in chapter II
presents these fundamental features.

In chapter V, we study the hypothesis of subordination. We
ﬁrst start by pointing out the effect of the discrete nature of ab-
solute price changes in the log-returns. Thereafter, we verify
the subordination hypothesis using both tick-by-tick data (this
data records all trades in a given day, see chapter III) as well
as 5 minutes log-returns and number of trades (ticks) data. We
ﬁnd that if we use the integrated variance (Vt), which is pro-
portional to the number of trades (Nt), as our subordinator,
we are able to explain approximately the central 85% of the
probability distribution for the log-returns xt between 1 hour
and 1 day. Finally, we show the quality of modelling the sub-
ordinator Vt with the CIR process introduced in section V C
and discuss the implication of such model for the log-returns
xt.

The last chapter of this thesis presents work on the time
evolution of the distribution of income. We show the evolu-
tion of the distribution of personal income in the United States
from 1983 to 2001. We show that the bulk of the distribution
(excluding very small income and very large income), is de-
scribed by the Exponential distribution with average income
changing from year to year in approximately the same rate as
inﬂation. We conclude that the inﬂation-discounted income
of the majority of the population is approximately the same
throughout time and therefore well approximated by a system
in thermal equilibrium. We also show that the top 3% earn-
ers have income that changes over time even when inﬂation

is accounted for. This chapter is self contained and does not
require any other part of the thesis to be read.

II. HESTON MODEL FOR ASSET RETURNS

The Heston model was introduced by Heston [48] and be-
longs to the class of stochastic volatility models, which have
received a great deal of attention in the ﬁnancial literature spe-
cially in connection with option pricing [45].

Empirical veriﬁcation of the Heston model was done for
both stocks [1, 2, 49, 63, 64] and options [46, 65, 66, 67],
and good agreement with the data has been found in these
studies. The version of the Heston model for stock returns
used in [1, 2, 49], as well as in this thesis, was modiﬁed from
the original solution by Heston and has evolved into a different
formula with 3 parameters. One parameter for the variance
(θ), one parameter representing the characteristic relaxation
time to the Gaussian distribution (1/γ) and another that gives
the general shape of the curve (α).

The outline of this chapter is as follows. First, we present
the modiﬁed Heston model used in this work by showing its
evolution from solving the related stochastic differential equa-
tions (SDE). Thereafter, we introduce subordination and we
show the development of the modiﬁed Heston model through
subordination.

In order to solve (1) and (2) together with (3), we ﬁrst
change variables from stock price St to mean removed (de-
µt (4). All further results
mean) log-return xt = ln(St/S0)
and solutions are constructed for the demean log-return xt,
which we will simply refer to as log-return or return:

After performing the change of variables from price to re-
turn, we solve the Fokker-Planck equation (5) [62] implied by
vi) to
SDEs (2) and (4), for the transition probability Pt(x, v
ﬁnd the return x and the volatility v at time t given the initial
demean log-return x = 0 and variance vi at t = 0. For sim-
plicity, we drop the explicit time dependence notation for the
returns xt and call them x.

The operation of removing the initial volatility dependence
of the marginal probability density Pt(x
vi) using equation
(11) was ﬁrst introduced in Ref. [49]. This removes an ad-
ditional degree of freedom and therefore simpliﬁes the ﬁnal
marginal probability density.

|

In order to further simplify the original Heston model, we
assume that equations (1) and (2) are uncorrelated. That
amounts in taking ρ = 0 in expression (13). This approxi-
mation was shown to be acceptable for some companies and
indexes in the US market [1, 2, 49] but might not be good for
different markets [64] or for option pricing [45, 48].

In order to arrive at the probability density function used
in this work, we need to further simplify the equation for
Pt(x, ρ = 0) (12) into a zero skew symmetrical function.

We replace in (12) px →

We have expressed the original Heston model for the prob-
ability density of log-returns x, in a highly symmetrical form
with three parameters, θ, α and γ. The parameter θ can
be found by calculating the variance of demean log-returns
σ2
= θt (21) of Pt(x) (19). The remaining two pa-
t ≡ h
rameters, α and γ, are responsible for the general shape of the
curve and the relaxation rate of Pt(x) to a Gaussian distribu-
tion [2, 49]. The parameter α is also responsible to deﬁne the
analyticity at zero return. If α = 1, value used in this thesis,
the short-time-limit is a double exponential distribution (see
next subsection). This distribution is not analytical at zero
but becomes when time progresses. For α > 1 the distribu-
tion is always analytical with a center that is Gaussian and
when α < 1 the distribution starts non-analytic at zero (going
to zero as a power-law with exponent 2α
1 [49]) and then
evolves into a analytic distribution with Gaussian center.

≪

The short time lag limit of the modiﬁed Heston model (19)
2 in expression (7). We also
can be found by assuming Ωt
0, since we interested in the short-
take ρ = 0 and ipx →
time-limit of the symmetric modiﬁed Heston model of equa-
2 in (7), the resulting
tion (19). When taking the limit Ωt
PDF is the Fourier inverse of the characteristic function of a
Gaussian with random variance vi and zero drift. Since vi is a
Gamma random variable with distribution (10), the ﬁnal char-
acteristic function for the short-time-limit distribution of the
modiﬁed Heston model is

Notice that the short time limit is not a Gaussian with vari-
ance vi, only because of the assumed randomization of vi (24).
Therefore, this randomization has substantial effect in the lim-
iting distributions, which can be checked empirically [2] (em-
pirical results will be presented in chapter IV).

The characteristic function in equation (28) is the charac-
teristic function for the zero skew Normal Inverse Gaussian
(NIG) model. NIG was ﬁrst introduced by Barndorff-Nielsen
to describe the distribution of sand particles sizes [73] and was
subsequently used in other physical problems such as turbu-
lence [74]. In 1995, Barndorff-Nielsen also introduced NIG
for stock returns [35]. NIG can also be obtained as a limit
of the Generalized Hyperbolic distribution [33, 75], as well
as by subordinating a Brownian motion to the inverse gaus-
sian distribution [33] (next section will introduce the idea of
subordination).

NIG is part of the wide class of L´evy pure jump models
[33], and the fact that it is recovered as a limit of the simpli-
ﬁed Heston stochastic volatility model (19), is another conse-
quence of the randomization of vi. Notice that if we take the
long time limit before the randomization of vi in the full He-
ston model given in Eq. (7), we will not ﬁnd NIG as the long
time limit.

The central limit theorem can be invoked for NIG and there-
fore for Heston [15, 27, 35, 49]. That is, as time progresses,
the distribution Pt(x) of returns x will become increasingly
Gaussian. The characteristic time scale for the central limit
t0 the probability dis-
theorem to act is t0 = 2/(αγ). For t
tribution is essentially Normal with mean zero and variance
θt.

≫

Notice that for long time lags t, there are two characteristic
1/γ and then
time limits. Heston tends to NIG for times t
≫
1/αγ. If
NIG tends to a Normal distribution for times t
1, NIG and Heston regimes can not be effectively dis-
α
tinguished. It is only in the case α < 1, that there will be a
distinguished NIG regime.

In summary, the most important limits for Pt(x) that we

and Gaussian at long time lags,

B. Heston model and subordination

Subordination is a form of randomization in which one con-
structs a new probability distribution, by assuming one or
more parameters of the original probability distribution to be
random [27],

PN ew(y, z) =

dθP (y, θ)Q(θ, z).

(30)

∞

Z

−∞

In the case of subordination, a Markov process Y (N )
is randomized by introducing a non-negative process N (t),
called a randomized operational time. The resulting process
Y (N (t)) does not need to be Markovian in general [27]. We
restrict ourselves to subordination of a Brownian motion with
drift θ and standard deviation σ (31). We also assume in what
follows, that t is time lag in usual units of time, unless oth-
erwise indicated. The probability density Pt(y) for the time
changed Brownian motion Y (N ) can be written

The moments of a Brownian subordinated process are re-

dence of the moments of Y are given by the moments of the
randomized operational time N . Furthermore, even though
the subordinator has odd moments, odd moments in the re-
sulting process Y are only different from zero, if the Gaussian
= 0. For the present work, we
in equation (31) has a drift θ
assume that the odd moments are all zero since the empirical
probability distribution of log-returns are quite well described
by zero skew probability distributions and because we work
with mean zero returns [2]. By assuming zero odd moments
probability distribution, we simplify the even moments. The
second and fourth moments for Y depend only on the ﬁrst and
second moments of the subordinator N (33,35).

In the case of the modiﬁed Heston model (19), the subor-
dination takes the following terms. We assume that the log-
returns x follow a Brownian motion with zero drift and vari-
ance Vt. The variance Vt is our “random operational time”,
since it changes randomly. We will show in chapter V that
the variance Vt can be estimated (at least partially) using the
number of trades Nt that occur in a the time interval t. The
variance Vt is then a constant times Nt, Vt = σ2Nt.

The variance Vt is given by Vt =

t
0 ds vs, where the in-
stantaneous variance vt appearing in the SDE (2) is integrated
R
in the interval 0
t. For this reason, Vt is also know as in-
tegrated variance. The Laplace transform for the conditional
vi) is analytically known [33, 71].
probability density Pt(Vt|
Therefore, subordination becomes a useful tool to construct
asset models with stochastic variance having the CIR process
as a subordinator [37].

The time dependence of the variance (41) shows that the
CIR process is not independent and identically distributed
(IID). That is expected since we have a mean reverting SDE
(2) for the instantaneous variance vt with exponential relax-
ation to the mean [62, 71, 72].

We have shown that subordinating a zero drift gaussian to
the integrated Vt, given by equation (37) is equivalent to solv-
ing for the transition probability densities for the uncorrelated
(ρ = 0 in equation (3)) system of SDEs dxt = √vtdW (1)

III. GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DATA AND
METHODS

We use 2 databases for this study. Daily closing prices
are downloaded from Yahoo [50] and intraday data is con-
structed using the TAQ database from the NYSE [51]. The
TAQ database records every transaction that occurred in the
market (tick-by-tick data), where the average number of trans-
actions in a day for a highly traded stock, such as Intel, is
20000 (from 1993 to 2001). That is equivalent, in terms of
data quantity, to approximately 77 years of daily data.

Our data has the time that the transaction occurred, the price
the transaction was realized and the volume of the transaction
(number of shares that exchanged hands). The TAQ database
does not account for splits or dividends whereas Yahoo gives
the prices corrected for splits and dividends. However we
do need to correct for splits and dividends because the TAQ
database is used only when constructing intraday returns. The
splits and dividends are realized overnight and therefore will
not show up if we calculate intraday returns.

After downloading the TAQ data, we remove any trade that
is recorded as an error and also restrict the data to trades that
took place inside the conventional 6.5 hours trading day from
9: 30 AM to 4: 00 PM. Any trade that happen before 9: 30 AM
and after 4: 00 PM is ignored. We choose to restrict to busi-
ness hours because we want our data set to agree with Yahoo

FIG. 3: Average number of trades (ticks) in a given period of the
day. The error bars represent the volatility. The red solid line gives
the best ﬁt parabola to the average number of trades. Same type of
pattern is found for absolute returns [54] and volume.

the probability density for the returns, volume and number of
trades is only approximately stationary throughout the years.
When studying returns (chapter IV), we assume the data as
stationary, and we take data from 1993 to 1999. When study-
ing subordination using the number of trades (chapter V), we
reduce the non-stationary effect of the data by working with
one year of data.

In order to study intraday returns, we construct from the
tick-by-tick data, 5 minutes close prices. The 5 minute close
price is deﬁned in analogy with the day close price. The 5
minutes volume ( or number of trades (ticks)) is the sum of
all traded volume ( or number of trades (ticks)) in a 5 minutes
interval.

When constructing intraday returns time series, we do not
include nights or weekends. Effectively our largest intraday
return is from open to close (time lag of 390 min = 6.5 hours).
A common procedure, not adopted here, is to assume the open
of the next day as the close of the present day [60, 61]. This
will include returns that are effectively overnight, where no

the TAQ database at each 5 minute interval from Thursday, 2nd

Days are separated by an effective overnight time interval that is con-
structed from the data, such that the open-to-close variance and the
close-to-close variance of the log-returns follow the same

daily data in the limit of one day that is deﬁned from the open
bell (9: 30 AM) to close bell (4: 00 PM).

We deﬁne as the daily open price, the price of the ﬁrst trade
that happened after or at 9: 30 AM. We also deﬁne the daily
close price, the price of the trade that happened right before or
at 4: 00 PM. A typical time series for intraday prices, number
of trades and volumes for 1 particular week is shown in Fig.
1.

Notice that the intraday volume and trading activity (num-
ber of trades) can be well described by a parabola (Fig. 3).
This typical intraday pattern [52, 53] has also been found
for high-frequency volatility proxies, such as the root mean
square return for all ticks that happen in a certain interval of
time [54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59]. The statistics for such a pattern
for the number of trades of Intel in the year 1997 is shown in
Fig. 3. Notice that the probability density for different parts of
the day will clearly have different widths and averages. There-
fore, mixing all parts of the day will result in a wider probabil-
ity density for number of trades and other intraday quantities
[53]. We do not study the consequences of such a mixture, we
only are careful to work with intraday time lags that divide
equally all day [2]. In such a way, all parts of the daily trend
are equally represented. Since we are working with prices
quoted at every 5 minutes (Five minutes close prices) and the
day from open to close has only 78 such intervals, we work
with returns that are t = 5, 10, 15, 30, 65, 130, 195, 390 min-
utes long.

Another important characteristic of daily and intraday data
is shown in Fig. 2. The cumulative number of trades from
i=12/31/2001
1993 to 2001 (
i=01/01/1993 Ni) increase almost exponen-
tially. The behavior of the commutative number of trades
shows that the average number of trades change from year to
year. The same type of behavior is found for the square of the
demean log-returns (the variance of the returns). Therefore,

log-returns that do not include overnight time lags (dashed lines). We
choose not to include overnight time lags in our intraday return time
series.

trades are present. The result of such practice is illustrated in
Fig. 4. Clearly, the tails of the distribution of returns including
overnight time lags are considerably enhanced, if compared
with the distribution of intraday returns that do not include
overnight time lags.

−

When working with high-frequency (intraday) data record-
ing errors are inevitable.
In order to remove errors in the
tick-by-tick data as well as our 5 minutes close time series,
created from the tick-by-tick data, we use Yahoo database as
our benchmark. We assume that the daily Yahoo database
does not have errors. Our ﬁltering technique consists of
two parts. First, we calculate the log-return between the
maximum and minimum price of a given day for the Ya-
hoo data (rHL). We then calculate the log-return (r5min =
ln(ST −5min)) for the 5 minutes price data in the
ln(ST )
same day and compare to rHL. We replace any log-return
> rHL with the return immediately preceding it. We
rt|
|
also replace the number of trades and volume of the “cor-
rupted” 5 minute interval by the immediately preceding ones.
The second ﬁltering procedure consists of requiring that the
largest and smallest 5 minutes log-return (r5min) in a given
day, be between the maximum and the minimum of all the
time series formed by the yahoo open to close return data
(min(rOC ) < r5min < max(rOC )). Once again, if the
condition min(rOC ) < r5min < max(rOC ) is not satisﬁed,
we replace the “corrupted” log-return, volume and number of
trades by the immediately preceding one.

The typical effect of such a simple error removal algorithm

is to change less than 1% (on the order of 0.1%) of the data.

The same ﬁltering procedure is used for tick-by-tick data,
except that instead of replacing the “corrupted” log-return and
volume, we just ignore it. In fact ignoring or replacing by the
nearest value is found to be equivalent (for tick-by-tick or 5
minutes data) for the purpose of this work:
the probability
density and moments are the same.

IV. MESOSCOPIC RETURNS

The actual observed empirical probability distribution func-
tions (EDFs) for different assets have been extensively stud-
ied in recent years [1, 15, 49, 60, 61, 64, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81].
We focus here on the EDFs of the returns of individual large
American companies from 1993 to 1999, a period without ma-
jor market disturbances. By ‘return’ we always mean ‘log-
return’, the difference of the logarithms of prices at two times
separated by a time lag t.

The time lag t is an important parameter: the EDFs evolve
with this parameter. At micro lags (typically shorter than one
hour), effects such as the discreteness of prices and transac-
tion times, correlations between successive transactions, and
ﬂuctuations in trading rates become important (for discrete-
ness effects see chapter V)[15, 16]. Power-law tails of EDFs
in this regime have been much discussed in the literature be-
fore [60, 61]. At ‘meso’ time lags (typically from an hour to
a month), continuum approximations can be made, and some
sort of diffusion process is plausible, eventually leading to a
normal Gaussian distribution. On the other hand, at ‘macro’
time lags, the changes in the mean market drifts and macroe-
conomic ‘convection’ effects can become important, so sim-
ple results are less likely to be obtained. The boundaries be-
tween these domains to an extent depend on the stock, the
market where it is traded, and the epoch. The micro-meso
boundary can be deﬁned as the time lag above which power-
law tails constitute a very small part of the EDF. The meso-
macro boundary is more tentative, since statistical data at long
time lags become sparse.

The ﬁrst result is that we extend to meso time lags a stylized
fact[124] known since the 19th century [82] (quoted in [19]):
with a careful deﬁnition of time lag t, the variance of returns
is proportional to t.

The second result is that log-linear plots of the EDFs show
prominent straight-line (tent-shape) character, i.e. the bulk
(about 99%) of the probability distribution of log-return fol-
lows an exponential law. The exponential law applies to the
central part of EDFs, i.e. not too big log-returns. For the far
tails of EDFs, usually associated with power laws at micro
time lags, we do not have enough statistically reliable data
points at meso lags to make a deﬁnite conclusion. Exponen-
tial distributions have been reported for some world markets
[1, 49, 64, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81] and brieﬂy mentioned in the
book [15] (see Fig. 2.12). However, the exponential law has
not yet achieved the status of a stylized fact. Perhaps this is
because inﬂuential work [60, 61] has been interpreted as ﬁnd-
ing that the individual returns of all the major US stocks for
micro to macro time lags have the same power law EDFs, if
they are rescaled by the volatility.

The Heston model is a plausible diffusion model with
stochastic volatility, which reproduces the timelag-variance
proportionality and the crossover from exponential distribu-
tion to Gaussian. This model was ﬁrst introduced by Heston,
who studied option prices [48]. Later Dr˘agulescu and Yako-
venko (DY) derived a convenient closed-form expression for
the probability distribution of returns in this model and ap-
plied it to stock indexes from 1 day to 1 year [49]. The third

A. Data analysis and discussion

We analyzed the data from Jan/1993 to Jan/2000 for 27
Dow companies, but show results only for four large cap com-
panies: Intel (INTC) and Microsoft (MSFT) traded at NAS-
DAQ, and IBM and Merck (MRK) traded at NYSE (please
see the appendix for more companies). We use two databases,
TAQ to construct the intraday returns and Yahoo database for
the interday returns (see Chapter III). The intraday time lags
were chosen at multiples of 5 minutes, which divide exactly
the 6.5 hours (390 minutes) of the trading day. The interday
returns are as described in [1, 49] for time lags from 1 day to
1 month = 20 trading days.

In order to connect the interday and intraday data, we have
to introduce an effective overnight time lag Tn. Without
this correction, the open-to-close and close-to-close variances
would have a discontinuous jump at 1 day, as shown in the in-
set of the left panel of Fig. 5. By taking the open-to-close time
to be 6.5 hours, and the close-to-close time to be 6.5 hours +
x2
is proportional to time t, as
Tn, we ﬁnd that variance

shown in the left panel of Fig. 5. The slope gives us the He-
ston parameter θ in Eq. (21). Tn is about 2 hours (see Table
I).

x

In the right panel of Fig. 5, we show the log-linear plots of
the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) vs. normalized
−∞ Pt(x′) dx′,
return x/√θt. The CDFt(x) is deﬁned as
and we show CDFt(x) for x < 0 and 1
CDFt(x) for x > 0.
We observe that CDFs for different time lags t collapse on
a single straight line without any further ﬁtting (the parame-
ter θ is taken from the ﬁt in the left panel). More than 99%
of the probability in the central part of the tent-shape distri-
bution function is well described by the exponential function.
Moreover, the collapsed CDF curves agree with the DY for-

xt

In the left panel of Fig. 7 we compare the empirical PDF
Pt(x) with the DY formula (20). The agreement is quite good,
except for the very short time lag of 5 minutes, where the tails
are visibly fatter than exponential. In order to make a more de-
tailed comparison, we show the empirical CDFs (points) with
the theoretical DY formula (lines) in the right panel of Fig.
7. We see that, for micro time lags of the order of 5 minutes,
the power-law tails are signiﬁcant. However, for meso time
lags, the CDFs fall onto straight lines in the log-linear plot,
indicating exponential law. For even longer time lags, they
evolve into the Gaussian distribution in agreement with the
DY formula (20) for the Heston model. To illustrate the point
further, we compare empirical and theoretical data for several
other companies in Fig. 8.

In the empirical CDF plots, we actually show the ranking
plots of log-returns xt for a given t. So, each point in the
plot represents a single instance of price change. Thus, the
last one or two dozens of the points at the far tail of each plot
constitute a statistically small group and show large amount
of noise. Statistically reliable conclusions can be made only
about the central part of the distribution, where the points are
dense, but not about the far tails.

We have shown that in the mesoscopic range of time lags,
the probability distribution of ﬁnancial returns interpolates be-
tween exponential and Gaussian law. The time range where
the distribution is exponential depends on a particular com-
pany, but it is typically between an hour and few days. Sim-
ilar exponential distributions have been reported for the In-
dian [77], Japanese [78], German [79], and Brazilian markets
[64, 80], as well as for the US market [1, 49, 81] (see also Fig.
2.12 in [15]). The DY formula [49] for the Heston model [48]
captures the main features of the probability distribution of re-
turns from an hour to a month with a single set of parameters.

V. NUMBER OF TRADES AND SUBORDINATION

The concept of subordination has important fundamental
and practical implications. From a fundamental point of view,
it gives a relation between microstructure of the market and
price formation that can be exploited in simulations and mod-
elling [42, 55, 84, 85]. From a practical point of view, the
subordinator can be identiﬁed with the integrated variance Vt
[56, 86]. This would imply a direct measure of the mean
square return which could impact pricing and hedging both
of options on a particular stock as well as variance swaps and

options on the variance.

In this chapter we verify and model the subordination hy-
pothesis as given by Eq. (36). We will restrict our study to
intraday Intel data in the year 1997. We restrict to a year of
data because of the nonlinear drift of the number of trades:
we would like to minimize this effect (see Fig. ??). We chose
Intel because it has been studied by us in Ref. [2] (chapter IV)
and it can be modelled well with the Heston model introduced
in chapter IV. It is true that it is a highly traded stock, and that
is an advantage, since that are a lot of trades in a day and there-
fore the statistics is better. Therefore smaller stocks should be
also checked in the future. The year of 1997 represents most
of what one ﬁnds for other years, except perhaps 2000 and
2001 which we did not veriﬁed because of technical problems
(to large data set requires especial computing techniques that
should be implemented in the future).

We begin by showing the inﬂuence of the discrete nature of
the absolute price change in the intraday log-return data. This
is rarely pointed out, even though there is a vast literature on
intraday log-returns [15, 60, 61, 68, 87]. This discreteness
has to be accounted for when considering subordination, or
even when studying intraday returns. It implies that a contin-
uous probability density is only a convenient approximation
for some return horizons.

In section V B, we verify when and for what range of
data does subordination apply. We assume that the integrated
volatility Vt is the random subordinator of a driftless Brown-
ian motion and that Vt is proportional to the number of trades
Nt in an interval of time t. We also use tick-by-tick data to
check for subordination by constructing the probability den-
sity of the log-returns xN after N trades (36).

In section V C, we model the integrated variance Vt with
the CIR process introduced in Eq. (38). We present the level
of agreement between the data and the theoretical CIR model
and we link these results to the distribution of log-returns xt.
In the last section, we present a summary of our ﬁndings.

A. Discrete nature of stock returns

On a tick-by-tick level, price changes are discrete. There is
a minimal price change for bid and offers that is set by internal
rules of the stock exchange. In the case of Intel in the year of
1997, the minimal price change was $1/8 for the ﬁrst part of
the year and after June, 24th it became $1/16 [88, 89]. Never-
theless, empirically we ﬁnd that the smallest price change on
realized transactions is h = $1/64 (Fig. 9). This difference
is a direct consequence of the mechanism of trading, and we
will not study it here (see Ref. [90, 91])[125]. We note that
the minimal price change set by law is clear in Fig. 9, since
the most probable price changes are indeed 0,
4h = $1/16
and
8h = $1/8, according to the rules of the NASDAQ ex-
change in 1997.

Our goal in this section is to identify the discrete nature
of absolute price changes [126] after N trades (mN h =
Sn−N ) in the log-returns after N trades (xN =
Sn −
ln(Sn−N )) and in log-returns after a time-lag t
ln(Sn)
ln(ST −t)), since these log-returns are the

N = 1 to a “constant wave” for N = 4000.

−

quantities that we ultimately want to model. We want to point
out that the discrete nature of the log-returns for intraday work
is generally overlooked but it can inﬂuence in the analysis of
short returns.

We will refer to minimal price change h = $1/64 as “quan-
tum of price” or simply “quantum” in analogy with quantum
mechanics.

The discrete nature of the price change can be used to model
the price dynamics starting from a microscopic approach as
recently suggested in [55, 57, 92, 93]. We are interested in the
limit where the quantum effect is not noticeable and therefore
quantities such as number of trades and returns can be treated
as continuous random variables.

Fig. 9 shows the probability density for the dimensionless
Sn−N )/h after N trades
absolute price return mN = (Sn −
in steps of one quantum h. The nature of the tick-by-tick dis-
tribution (N = 1) is considerably different from N = 4000.
More than 50% of the returns are zero for N = 1, and most
of the other returns have a probability of less than 1% except
8h. The probability has a clearly oscillatory nature
±
where multiples of 4h are maxima (Fig. 9, top panel). After
4000 trades the probability distribution for mN has changed
into a two level system (Fig. 9). The probability of the most
probable mN in N = 1 have now approximately the same
probability. Therefore, the zero return has (after 4000 trades)
a comparable probability to the other probability maxima.

The quantum nature of the price changes is removed by
working with log-returns, except for the zero return. Notice
that intraday log-returns can be approximated by the ratio [94]

where S0 is the ﬁrst open of the year (in the case of Intel 1997,
S0 = $131.75).

The effect of taking log-returns is illustrated in Fig. 10.
For each absolute return mN , there is a potentially different
denominator Sn−N /h (42) composed by a random walk with
integer valued steps about a level C (43). Clearly the values
of the ratio xN will not be integer. Therefore, the ratio of mN
in Eq. (43) spreads the concentrated discrete absolute returns
multiple of h, around the multiple.

The lower panel of Fig. 10 shows the probability density of
xN /h conditioned on mN . The conditional probability den-
sity P (xN /h
mN ) illustrates a spread for each mN that is
|
larger than h. This spread is enough to mix the discreteness
with exception of mN = 0.

The quality of such a mixture can be seen in Fig. 11 and
Fig. 12. Even though the cumulative density function for xN
is practically continuous (even for N = 1) with exception of
xN = 0, the stepwise nature of mN can be easily recognized
up to N = 1000 (Fig. 12). The oscillations in the cumulative
density functions for xN are centered about the discrete steps
of the cumulative density function of mN .

The discrete quantum effect at mN = 0 is quite persistent,
but it can be neglected for returns xN with large number of
trades N (for instance N = 4000). Empirically, it appears
that the criteria for neglecting the mN = 0 effect is that the
probability of having mN = 0 is of the same order of mag-
nitude as the probability of having any other mN (Fig.9). For
Intel 1997 this transition starts approximately at N = 1000.

The effect of data discreteness is also present in the log-
return xt of time lag t. From the log-return xt, we can con-

returns, xN /h (black line), and dimensionless absolute returns, mN
(blue symbols). Even though the discreteness of mN is removed
with exception of xN = 0, the signature of such discreteness is still
visible. Notice the stepwise nature of the black line.

struct xN by conditioning on the number of trades N present
in t (Nt). The opposite is also true, by conditioning on t we
can construct xt from xN . Therefore some of the discrete
effects that are present in xN will be present in xt. As an ex-
ample consider 5 minute log-returns. The average number of
trades is
184. Because of the reciprocity
in constructing the PDF for xt from xN (and vice-versa) by
conditioning, this shows that in the composition of xt=5min,
there is a wide range of xN for which the discrete features
can not be ignored (clear oscillations and large probability for
xt = 0). If we approximate the PDF of Nt=5min by a Gaus-
sian distribution, we would have in xt=5min, with the high-
est probability, Nt=5min = 200. Therefore some fraction of
xN = 200 will be sampled when we construct the probability
of xt=5min by conditioning, these returns clearly have a lot
of discrete features (Fig. 12) and these features will pass to
xt=5min.

Fig. 13 shows the oscillatory stepwise cumulative proba-
bility density and also the special nature of xt=5min = 0 for
the cumulative probability density of xt=5min. Compare this
ﬁgure with Fig. 11 and Fig. 12. These features originate from
xN and represent small ﬂat portions in the probability density
function.

Finally, from the sequence of Figs. 11 and 12 and the cor-
respondence between xN and xt, we can conclude that the
discrete effects become negligible for a time lag t > 1 hour.

B. Verifying subordination with intraday data

The hypothesis of subordination introduced by Clark [26]
has had a strong economical implication, and following his
work there is a vast body of theoretical and empirical work
which addresses the issue [38, 39, 40, 41, 42]. Similar to the
work of Refs. [40, 41], we verify for subordination consid-
ering integrated variance Vt, constructed from the number of
trades Nt, to be the subordinator of a Brownian motion.

Due to the discrete nature of the distribution of intraday re-
turns presented in section (V A), we can only talk about sub-

fects become small. In what follows, we will take all time lags
even those where the discrete effects are large. Nevertheless,
we will see that the best subordination will take place for time
lags for which discrete effects can be ignored.

The ﬁrst implication of subordination can be veriﬁed with
the use of moments given by equations (33) and (35). Figs.
15 and 16 show the linear time relation for both the variance
of xt and the mean of Nt as expected from equation (33).
Furthermore, since we are assuming a Brownian motion with
stochastic variance given by the number of trades, log-returns
xN after N trades should be Gaussian distributed with vari-

distributed with mean zero and standard deviation one, due to
the central limit theorem [27, 41].

Finally, we check subordination by numerically calculating
the probability mixture equation (36). We construct the prob-
ability density function of the number of trades Nt inside a
time interval t by binning the time series of Nt. The choice
for binwidth is according to Ref. [95]. However, the result ap-
pears independent of binwidth as long as the binwidth chosen
is not too large. The cumulative probability density function
for the measured xt and the non-parametric reconstructed x′
t
are shown in Fig. 21.

The distributions in Fig. 17, Fig. 19 and Fig. 21(solid
line) show an agreement of approximately 85% of the data
with the subordination hypothesis for time lags above t > 1
hour or N > 2500 (Fig. 18). However, the subordination is
clearly bad for times close to one day (t = 6.5 hours), where
we do not have enough data (253 points) to draw meaningful
conclusions.

Notice the clear disagreement above 2 standard deviations
(STD) as well as at zero in Fig. 17 and Fig. 19. The deviations
at zero are due to the discrete nature of the data (section V A)
while the deviations above 2 STD show that the subordination
hypothesis can not explain the large changes in returns [42].

now of approximately 16%. In order to verify the origin of
such difference, we remove 8% of the largest log-return xt

of the CIR ﬁt for Intel in the year 1997. We also show that the
quality of the Heston ﬁt to xt with parameters from the Vt CIR
ﬁt is consistent with the quality of the subordination: we are
able to model most of the central 85% of the xt distribution.
Due to previous studies with intraday log-returns [2] (see
also chapter IV), we assume α = 1 for the simpliﬁed CIR
model in equation (38). The parameter θ is found from the re-
lation θ = ησ2
N (44). The remaining parameter γ is found by
ﬁtting the empirical P DF (Vt) for time lags t = 1: 05 hours
and t = 2: 10 hours simultaneously. The regular quality of
such a ﬁt is shown in Figs. 22 and 23. The theoretical CIR
lines are above the data (Fig. 23). Furthermore, the time de-
pendence of the theoretical PDF and CDF only approximately
follow the data. For times below 1 hour the probability maxi-
mum of the empirical distribution is to the left of the theoreti-
cal distribution and for times above 1 hour to the right.

The results shown in Figs. 22 and 23 indicate that the CIR
is only approximately valid. The quality can be further as-
sessed by constructing the variance of the Vt as a function of
the time lag t. Fig. 24 shows that the theoretical variance
given in equation (41) is only approximately correct. Never-
theless from equation (33), we know that the variance of Vt
corresponds to the kurtosis of xt. This indicates that even
though Vt can not be modelled well (not even the second mo-
ment) the implication of that is only important to the fourth
and higher moments in the log-returns xt.

To verify the quality of the parameters found by ﬁtting the
subordinator, Vt, in explaining the log-returns, xt, we present
Figs. 25 and 26. The empirical PDF (25) and CDF (26) for
xt show that the corresponding Heston model (dashed black
lines), constructed with parameters found by ﬁtting CIR to the
probability density of Vt, is able to ﬁt only the center of the

Having veriﬁed that a Brownian motion subordinated to the
number of trades Nt via Vt can describe approximately 85%
of the return data for time lags larger than 1 hour (or, if one ig-
nores discreetness effects such as the zero return effect, larger
than 30 minutes), we can model Vt instead of modelling xt.

In this section, we verify the quality of modelling Vt with a
CIR process as given in section (II B). We present the quality

parameter θ was found from the relation θ = σ2
N η (44), where
η is found from Fig. 14 and σ2
N is given such that the subor-
dination in Figs. 19 and 21 is the best possible. Finally, we ﬁt
the empirical PDFs (Fig. 25) for the parameter γ. Therefore,
we are effectively only ﬁtting γ, since all the other parameters
are the same used in the Vt ﬁt (Fig. 22). We ﬁnd that the γ
found from ﬁtting the empirical PDF of xt directly, is of the
same order of magnitude as with the one found by ﬁtting the
empirical PDF of Vt (0.05 from xt and 0.06 from Vt). This
shows, that the subordination indeed captures most of the in-
formation for the center of the distribution, since ﬁtting Vt or
xt for γ is equivalent.

Notice that the agreement of the theoretical Heston model
curves, constructed with parameters from the Vt ﬁt, is practi-
cally identical to the agreement found in Fig. 21(solid lines)
between the CDF of xt and the CDF constructed by subor-
dination using the non-parametric binned probability density
of Vt as the variance of a Gaussian random walk (36). The
information content in the number of trades and therefore in
the integrated variance distribution is almost all captured by
CIR, even with a regular ﬁt quality (Fig. 23). This last point
implies that even if we had a better ﬁt to the distribution of Vt,
the increase in the ﬁtting quality of the log-returns will not be
substantial.

A substantial increase in the ﬁtting quality of the empirical
PDF and CDF of the log-returns in Figs. 25 and 26 is attained
if one ﬁts the empirical PDF of xt directly with θ = 9.53
×
10−7 given in Fig. 15. This amounts to take σ2
N as given by
Fig. 14 and η by Fig. 16, such that relation (44) is still valid.
The parameter γ = 0.02 for the black solid lines in Fig. 26
is also considerably different from γ = 0.06, found by ﬁtting
10−7 such that
the empirical PDF of Vt and using θ = 8.01
σ2
N is the best ﬁt value for the subordination in Figs. 21(solid
line) and 19. The substantial increase in the ﬁtting quality for
xt, reemphasizes that the number of trades are only able to
describe the center of the distribution of log-returns (section

D. Conclusion

We have studied the discrete nature of the probability dis-
tribution of absolute returns that arises from the minimal dis-
crete price change for bid and offers allowed by the stock ex-
change. We have shown that such discrete nature implies that
the probability distributions of log-returns for intraday time
lags are only approximately continuous. The continuous ap-
proximation becomes good for returns with time lags longer
than 1 hour.

We have shown that, using the integrated volatility Vt =

integrating the theoretical probability density functions shown in Fig.

The solid line has parameters θ from Fig. 14 and γ is found directly
by ﬁtting xt. The dashed lines has θ = σ2
N from Fig.

then found by ﬁtting the probability density of Vt. Notice that the

nator of a driftless Brownian motion (36), we are able to de-
scribe the center (
85%) of the distribution of log-returns xt
for time lags t > 1 hour and smaller than t < 1 day. The
upper limit is restricted by the number of data points we have,
since we are working with only one year of data.

We also have shown that the CIR process is only able to
approximately describe the distribution function for Vt. How-
ever, this approximate description is already enough for the
corresponding Heston model to ﬁt the log-returns xt with ap-
proximately the maximum quality that the subordination al-
lows (

85%).

Finally, a direct ﬁt to the log-returns xt with the Heston
model results in a considerable increase in the ﬁtting quality.
This reemphasizes that the process of subordination, as im-
plied by the empirical probability density of Vt, is only able
to explain the center of the distribution of returns.

INCOME DISTRIBUTION

Attempts to apply the methods of exact sciences, such as
physics, to describe a society have a long history [96]. At the
end of the 19th century, Italian physicist, engineer, economist,
and sociologist Vilfredo Pareto suggested that income distri-
bution in a society is described by a power law [97]. Modern
data indeed conﬁrm that the upper tail of income distribution
follows the Pareto law [98, 99, 100, 101, 102]. However, the
majority of the population does not belong there, so charac-
terization and understanding of their income distribution re-
mains an open problem. Dr˘agulescu and Yakovenko [103]
proposed that the equilibrium distribution should follow an
exponential law analogous to the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribu-
tion of energy in statistical physics. The ﬁrst factual evidence

18

for the exponential distribution of income was found in Ref.
[104]. Coexistence of the exponential and power-law parts of
the distribution was recognized in Ref. [105]. However, these
papers, as well as Ref. [106], studied the data only for a par-
ticular year. Here we analyze temporal evolution of the per-
sonal income distribution in the USA during 1983–2001. We
show that the US society has a well-deﬁned two-income-class
structure. The majority of population (97–99%) belongs to the
lower income class and has a very stable in time exponential
(“thermal”) distribution of income. The upper income class
(1–3% of population) has a power-law (“superthermal”) dis-
tribution, whose parameters signiﬁcantly change in time with
the rise and fall of the stock market. Using the principle of
maximal entropy, we discuss the concept of equilibrium in-
equality in a society and quantitatively show that it applies to
the bulk of the population.

A. Data analysis and discussion

Most of academic and government literature on income dis-
tribution and inequality [107, 108, 109, 110] does not attempt
to ﬁt the data by a simple formula. When ﬁts are performed,
usually the log-normal distribution [111] is used for the lower
part of the distribution [100, 101, 102]. Only recently the ex-
ponential distribution started to be recognized in income stud-
ies [112, 113], and models showing formation of two classes
started to appear [114, 115].

Let us introduce the probability density P (r), which gives
the probability P (r) dr to have income in the interval (r, r +
r dr′P (r′) is
dr). The cumulative probability C(r) =
the probability to have income above r, C(0) = 1. By
analogy with the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution in statisti-
cal physics [103, 104], we consider an exponential function
r/T ), where T is a parameter analogous to
P (r)
temperature. It is equal to the average income T =

We analyze the data [116] on personal income distribution
compiled by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) from the tax
returns in the USA for the period 1983–2001 (presently the
latest available year). The publicly available data are already
preprocessed by the IRS into bins and effectively give the cu-
mulative distribution function C(r) for certain values of r.
First we make the plots of log C(r) vs. r (the log-linear plots)
for each year. We ﬁnd that the plots are straight lines for the
lower 97–98% of population, thus conﬁrming the exponen-
tial law. From the slopes of these straight lines, we determine
the income temperatures T for each year. In Fig. 27, we plot
C(r) and P (r) vs. r/T (income normalized to temperature)
in the log-linear scale. In these coordinates, the data sets for
different years collapse onto a single straight line.
(In Fig.
27, the data lines for 1980s and 1990s are shown separately
and offset vertically.) The columns of numbers in Fig. 27 list
the values of the annual income temperature T for the corre-
sponding years, which changes from 19 k$ in 1983 to 40 k$

≈

In Fig. 28, we show the same data in the log-log scale for
a wider range of income r, up to about 300T . Again we ob-
serve that the sets of points for different years collapse onto
a single exponential curve for the lower part of the distri-
bution, when plotted vs. r/T . However, above a certain in-
come r∗
4T , the distribution function changes to a power
law, as illustrated by the straight lines in the log-log scale
of Fig. 28. Thus we observe that income distribution in the
USA has a well-deﬁned two-class structure. The lower class
(the great majority of population) is characterized by the ex-
ponential, Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution, whereas the upper
class (the top few percent of population) has the power-law,
Pareto distribution. The intersection point of the exponential
and power-law curves determines the income r∗ separating
the two classes. The collapse of data points for different years
in the lower, exponential part of the distribution in Figs. 27
and 28 shows that this part is very stable in time and, essen-
tially, does not change at all for the last 20 years, save for
a gradual increase of temperature T in nominal dollars. We
conclude that the majority of population is in statistical equi-
librium, analogous to the thermal equilibrium in physics. On
the other hand, the points in the upper, power-law part of the
distribution in Fig. 28 do not collapse onto a single line. This
part signiﬁcantly changes from year to year, so it is out of

19

statistical equilibrium. A similar two-part structure in the en-
ergy distribution is often observed in physics, where the lower
part of the distribution is called “thermal” and the upper part
“superthermal” [117].

Temporal evolution of the parameters T and r∗ is shown in
Fig. 29. We observe that the average income T (in nominal
dollars) was increasing gradually, almost linearly in time, and
doubled in the last twenty years. In Fig. 29, we also show the
inﬂation coefﬁcient (the consumer price index CPI from Ref.
[118]) compounded on the average income of 1983. For the
twenty years, the inﬂation factor is about 1.7, thus most, if
not all, of the nominal increase in T is inﬂation. Also shown
in Fig. 29 is the nominal gross domestic product (GDP) per
capita [118], which increases in time similarly to T and CPI.
The ratio r∗/T varies between 4.8 and 3.2 in Fig. 29.

∞

∝

In Fig. 30, we show how the parameters of the Pareto tail
1/rα change in time. Curve (a) shows that the power-
C(r)
law index α varies between 1.8 and 1.4, so the power law is
not universal. Because a power law decays with r more slowly
than an exponential function, the upper tail contains more in-
come than we would expect for a thermal distribution, hence
we call the tail “superthermal” [117]. The total excessive in-
come in the upper tail can be determined in two ways: as the
r∗ dr′r′P (r′) of the power-law distribution, or as
integral
the difference between the total income in the system and the
R
income in the exponential part. Curves (c) and (b) in Fig. 30
show the excessive income in the upper tail, as a fraction f
of the total income in the system, determined by these two
methods, which agree with each other reasonably well. We
observe that f increased by the factor of 5 between 1983 and
2000, from 4% to 20%, but decreased in 2001 after the crash
of the US stock market. For comparison, curve (e) in Fig.
30 shows the stock market index S&P 500 divided by inﬂa-
tion. It also increased by the factor of 5.5 between 1983 and
1999, and then dropped after the stock market crash. We con-
clude that the swelling and shrinking of the upper income tail
is correlated with the rise and fall of the stock market. Similar
results were found for the upper income tail in Japan in Ref.
[99]. Curve (d) in Fig. 30 shows the fraction of population in
the upper tail. It increased from 1% in 1983 to 3% in 1999, but
then decreased after the stock market crash. Notice, however,
that the stock market dynamics had a much weaker effect on
the average income T of the lower, “thermal” part of income
distribution shown in Fig. 29.

For discussion of income inequality, the standard practice
is to construct the so-called Lorenz curve [107]. It is deﬁned
parametrically in terms of the two coordinates x(r) and y(r)
depending on the parameter r, which changes from 0 to

visible deviations exist. These deviations can be corrected
by taking into account that the total income in the system is
higher than the income in the exponential part, because of the
extra income in the Pareto tail. Correcting for this difference

G

The deviation of the Lorenz curve from the diagonal in Fig.
31 is a certain measure of income inequality. Indeed, if ev-
erybody had the same income, the Lorenz curve would be the
diagonal, because the fraction of income would be propor-
tional to the fraction of population. The standard measure of
income inequality is the so-called Gini coefﬁcient 0
1,
which is deﬁned as the area between the Lorenz curve and the
diagonal, divided by the area of the triangle beneath the di-
agonal [107]. It was calculated in Ref. [104] that G = 1/2
for a purely exponential distribution. Temporal evolution of
the Gini coefﬁcient, as determined by the IRS [110], is shown
in the inset of Fig. 31. In the ﬁrst approximation, G is quite
close to the theoretically calculated value 1/2. The agreement
can be improved by taking into account the Pareto tail, which
gives G = (1 + f )/2 for Eq. (46). The inset in Fig. 31 shows
that this formula very well ﬁts the IRS data for the 1990s
with the values of f taken from Fig. 30. We observe that in-
come inequality was increasing for the last 20 years, because
of swelling of the Pareto tail, but started to decrease in 2001
after the stock market crash. The deviation of G below 1/2 in
the 1980s cannot be captured by our formula. The data points
for the Lorenz curve in 1983 lie slightly above the theoretical
curve in Fig. 31, which accounts for G < 1/2.

Thus far we discussed the distribution of individual income.
An interesting related question is the distribution of family
income P2(r). If both spouses are earners, and their incomes
are distributed exponentially as P1(r)
r/T )[127],
then

Eq. (47) is in a good agreement with the family income dis-
tribution data from the US Census Bureau [104]. In Eq. (47),
we assumed that incomes of spouses are uncorrelated. This
assumption was veriﬁed by comparison with the data in Ref.
[106]. The Gini coefﬁcient for family income distribution
(47) was found to be G = 3/8 = 37.5% [104], in agree-

ment with the data. Moreover, the calculated value 37.5% is
close to the average G for the developed capitalist countries
of North America and Western Europe, as determined by the
World Bank [106].

On the basis of the analysis presented above, we propose
a concept of the equilibrium inequality in a society, charac-
terized by G = 1/2 for individual income and G = 3/8
for family income.
It is a consequence of the exponential
Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution in thermal equilibrium, which
maximizes the entropy S =
dr P (r) ln P (r) of a dis-
tribution P (r) under the constraint of the conservation law
∞
0 dr P (r) r = const. Thus, any deviation of income
r
h
distribution from the exponential one, to either less inequality
R
or more inequality, reduces entropy and is not favorable by
the second law of thermodynamics. Such deviations may be
possible only due to non-equilibrium effects. The presented
data show that the great majority of the US population is in
thermal equilibrium.

Finally, we brieﬂy discuss how the two-class structure of
income distribution can be rationalized on the basis of a ki-
netic approach, which deals with temporal evolution of the
probability distribution P (r, t). Let us consider a diffusion
model, where income r changes by ∆r over a period of time
∆t. Then, temporal evolution of P (r, t) is described by the
Fokker-Planck equation [119]

For the lower part of the distribution, it is reasonable to as-
sume that ∆r is independent of r.
In this case, the coefﬁ-
cients A and B are constants. Then, the stationary solution
∂tP = 0 of Eq. (48) gives the exponential distribution [103]
r/T ) with T = B/A. Notice that a mean-
P (r)
ingful solution requires that A > 0, i.e.
< 0 in Eq.
(48). On the other hand, for the upper tail of income distri-
bution, it is reasonable to expect that ∆r
r (the Gibrat law
[111]), so A = ar and B = br2. Then, the stationary so-
lution ∂tP = 0 of Eq. (48) gives the power-law distribution
1/rα+1 with α = 1 + a/b. The former process is
P (r)
additive diffusion, where income changes by certain amounts,
whereas the latter process is multiplicative diffusion, where
income changes by certain percentages. The lower class in-
come comes from wages and salaries, so the additive process
is appropriate, whereas the upper class income comes from in-
vestments, capital gains, etc., where the multiplicative process

is applicable. Ref. [99] quantitatively studied income kinetics
using tax data for the upper class in Japan and found that it is
indeed governed by a multiplicative process. The data on in-
come mobility in the USA are not readily available publicly,
but are accessible to the Statistics of Income Research Divi-
sion of the IRS. Such data would allow to verify the conjec-
tures about income kinetics.

The

exponential probability distribution P (r)

∝
r/T ) is a monotonous function of r with the most
exp(
probable income r = 0. The probability densities shown in
Fig. 27 agree reasonably well with this simple exponential
law. However, a number of other studies found a non-
monotonous P (r) with a maximum at r
= 0 and P (0) = 0.
These data were ﬁtted by the log-normal [100, 101, 102]
or the gamma distribution [113, 114, 120]. The origin of
the discrepancy in the low-income data between our work
and other papers is not completely clear at this moment.
The following factors may possibly play a role. First, one
should be careful to distinguish between personal income
and group income, such as family and household income. As
Eq. (47) shows, the latter is given by the gamma distribution
even when the personal income distribution is exponential.
Very often statistical data are given for households and mix
individual and group income distributions (see more discus-
sion in Ref. [104]). Second, the data from tax agencies and
.
census bureaus may differ. The former data are obtained from
tax declarations of all the taxable population, whereas the
latter data from questionnaire surveys of a limited sample of
population. These two methodologies may produce different
results, particularly for low incomes. Third, it is necessary to
distinguish between distributions of money [103, 120, 121],
wealth [114, 122], and income. They are, presumably, closely
related, but may be different in some respects. Fourth, the
low-income probability density may be different in the USA
and in other countries because of different Social Security
or more general policies. All these questions require careful
investigation in future work. We can only say that the data
sets analyzed in this paper and our previous papers are well
described by a simple exponential function for the whole
lower class. This does not exclude a possibility that other
functions can also ﬁt the data [123]. However, the exponential
law has only one ﬁtting parameter T , whereas log-normal,
gamma, and other distributions have two or more ﬁtting
parameters, so they are less parsimonious.

[124] Stylized facts is a term that comes from the economical litera-
ture. It refers to facts that can not be proved right. For instance,
the variance of returns is proportional to t for a good quantity
of stocks but there might be stocks where this is not a fact.

[125] One of the possible reasons for the different between empiri-
cal h and quoted price h is the bid and ask spread. That is the
difference in price between the buy and sell quote. Since we
work with transaction prices, these prices will tend to jump
between the bid and ask. And this gap is not quantized by law.
Another point to remember is that this quantum set by law only
make sense for limit orders (where the buyer of seller quotes
his preference price) and not market orders (the buyer or seller
buys at the ﬁrst available price). TAQ does not distinguish be-
tween order types.

[126] Absolute price change is used here as an opposite to relative
price changes. We do not refer to the absolute value. What we
refer as absolute price changes are also known as the P&L of
the trade.

[127] Even thought the income of women is generally lower that
men, this seems not to make a difference in temperature sig-
niﬁcant enough to be noticed.

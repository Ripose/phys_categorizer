We study the problem of what causes prices to change. We deﬁne the mechanical
impact of a trading order as the change in future prices in the absence of any future
changes in decision making, and its informational impact as the remainder of the total
impact once mechanical impact is removed. We introduce a method of measuring
mechanical impact and apply it to order book data from the London Stock Exchange.
The average mechanical impact of a market order decays to zero as a function of
time, at an asymptotic rate that is consistent with a power law with an exponent
of roughly 1.7. In contrast the average informational impact builds to approach a
constant value. Initially the impact is entirely mechanical, and is about half as big
as the asymptotic informational impact. The size of the informational impact is
positively correlated to mechanical impact. For cases where the mechanical impact
is zero for all times, we ﬁnd that the informational impact is negative, i.e. buy
market orders that have no mechanical impact at all generate strong negative price
responses.

INTRODUCTION

What causes prices to change? Despite a
great deal of research on this subject the an-
swer remains far from clear. On one hand,
everyone agrees that prices respond to infor-
mation – good news drives prices up and bad
news drives it down. On the other hand,
prices often change even when there is lit-
tle information, sometimes by large amounts

[7, 17]. How much of price changes are in-
formation driven, and how much are due to
other factors? Here we investigate one such
factor, the purely mechanical inﬂuence of ini-
tiating a trade. Such a trade might be gen-
erated by new information, but it might also
be generated at random.

In this paper we take advantage of the fact
that in many modern ﬁnancial markets prices
are formed in a limit order book (see Sec-
tion II A). While the placement of trading
orders may depend on complicated factors,
once trading orders are placed, price forma-
tion follows purely mechanical rules. Using
data that contains a complete record of trad-
ing orders, it is possible to disentangle the
purely mechanical inﬂuence of placing a trad-
ing order from other eﬀects.

To make this more precise, we propose a
method to decompose the eﬀect of trading
orders on prices. The total price impact is
the change in future prices conditioned on the
presence of a trading order to buy or sell. We
deﬁne the mechanical impact as the change
in future prices that occurs even if no other
orders are changed in any way. In contrast,
the informational impact of a trading order
is what is left of the total impact after the
mechanical impact is removed, i.e.
it is the
component that depends on relationships be-
tween orders. As discussed in Section VII A,
this can be either the causal eﬀect that a
given order has on future orders, or corre-
lated eﬀects between the placement of orders
(e.g. due to a common cause). More precise
deﬁnitions are given in Section III.

We ﬁnd that mechanical impact behaves
very diﬀerently than informational impact.
The immediate eﬀect of placing an order is
entirely mechanical (as it has to be, since
there is no possibility to alter any interven-
ing events). The average mechanical impact
decays monotonically in time, at a rate that
is slower than exponential. The long time

2

behavior is consistent with the hypothesis of
a power law tail, with an exponent of about
1.7. In contrast, informational impact grows
with time and approaches a constant value,
at least over the time horizon where statis-
tics remain reliable. The initial value of the
mechanical impact is about 50% of the size
of the asymptotic informational impact.

This paper is organized as follows: Sec-
tion II gives a brief summary of the prop-
erties of our data set and gives some back-
ground information about the functioning of
the continuous double auction and the Lon-
don Stock Exchange in particular. In Section
III we give more precise deﬁnitions of total
price impact and its decomposition into me-
chanical and informational components. We
then measure the average impacts and du-
In Sec-
rations for real data in Section IV.
tion V we study the eﬀects of long-memory in
amplifying mechanical impact. In Section VI
we study the correlations between mechanical
and information impact. Finally in Section
VII we discuss the implications and future
directions of this work.

II. BACKGROUND

A. Continuous double auction

We give a brief review of the continuous
double auction, which is the most common
mechanism used for trading in modern ﬁnan-
cial markets, and deﬁne some terminology
that will be essential in the remainder of the
paper. “Continuous” refers to the fact that
the market is asynchronous, so that trading
orders can be placed at any time, and “dou-
ble” refers to the fact that both buyers and
sellers are allowed to update their orders at
will. Orders contain both a trading quantity

3

and a limit price1. The list of unexecuted or-
ders is called the limit order book. A trans-
action is generated whenever an order crosses
the prices of orders of the opposite sign, e.g. if
a buy order has a higher price than the lowest
priced sell order. In this case we would say
that the transaction is buyer-initiated; sim-
ilarly, if a sell order crosses the best price,
we say that the transaction is seller-initiated.
If an order does not generate an immediate
transaction,
it is added to the limit order
book without a transaction taking place. It
is also possible to cancel any order sitting in
the limit order book at any time.

Real markets have a variety of diﬀerent
types of possible orders that vary from mar-
ket to market, but for our purposes it is pos-
sible to categorize all orders into three types
of events: Eﬀective market orders, deﬁned as
any order or component of an order that gen-
erates a transaction; Eﬀective limit orders,
deﬁned as any order or component of an order
that does not generate an immediate trans-
action, and cancellations. Our notion of ef-
fective orders may not be in one-to-one cor-
respondence with the actual orders that are
placed. For example, in a situation where
the lowest priced sell order on the book is
to sell 1000 shares at 50 pounds, an order to
buy 3000 shares at 50 pounds will result in a
transaction for 1000 shares at 50 pounds and
leave a buy order sitting in the book for 2000
shares. We will call such an order two eﬀec-
tive orders, an eﬀective market order followed
by an eﬀective limit order.

The LSE has two parallel markets, the on-
book market and the oﬀ-book market. The
on-book market operates via a continuous

indicating a willingness to accept any price. For
a buy order this is equivalent to an inﬁnite limit
price, and for a sell order a limit price of zero.

double auction as described above, in which
the limit order book is transparently visible
to everyone, but the identities of those plac-
ing the orders are concealed. The oﬀ-book
market operates through a bilateral exchange
in which agents contact each other via the
telephone or message boards and know the
identity of the agent they are trading with.
Trades in the oﬀ-book market are revealed
only after they occur, and the intention to
trade beforehand is only communicated to
a limited circle of contacts. For this rea-
son the on-book market is widely regarded
as the dominant force in price formation. It
accounts for more than half the number of
trades and about half the trading volume.
Here we study only data from the on-book
market.

B. Data

For the purpose of this study we have
used the TDS data set for the on-book mar-
ket of the London Stock Exchange (LSE).
The data set consists of records of orders
placed or cancelled within a 3 year period
during 2000-2002. We study three of the most
liquid stocks, Astrazeneca (AZN), Vodafone
(VOD), and Lloyds (LLOY). We will use
AZN for all the ﬁgures in the paper, but
we have repeated all the analyses for the
other stocks as well. Orders placed during
opening and closing auctions are excluded.
The resulting reduced data set contains about
570K transactions and 3.7M events for AZN,
1.0M transactions and 4.0M events for VOD,
and 600K transactions and 2.9M events for
LLOY.

We have done some cleaning to reduce
problems due to data errors. Because the
data set contains both a record of transac-
tions and a record of order placements we
can test to be sure that both records are

4

consistent. We ﬁnd some problems that we
do our best to correct. E.g.
there are a
few cases where orders are placed that are
never removed. We remove such orders. A
more serious problem is that the sequencing
of the orders is not accurate for orders that
are placed within the same second. This of-
ten results in nonsensical behavior, such as
negative spreads. When this occurs we re-
order the data to eliminate these problems.
This has a small eﬀect on the results at very
short time scales, but little eﬀect on longer
time scales.

In working with the data we have to deal
with the problem of interday boundaries. To
cope with this problem we have tried two
diﬀerent approaches. One is to reject any
situations where we cross interday bound-
aries. The other is to include situations
that cross interday boundaries, but to remove
price changes that occur outside the period of
our analysis. We use the latter approach for
the results presented here, but we do not ﬁnd
that it makes a big diﬀerence in our results.

(1)
where N is the size of the sample and hi indi-
cates a time average. This lumps together the
price impact of buy orders (positive events)
and sell orders (negative events). In general
these are diﬀerent, but the diﬀerence is small
and negligible for our purpose.

We have used two time units in this study:
One is event time, where an event is an eﬀec-
tive limit order, an eﬀective market order, or
a cancellation. The other is transaction time,
where a transaction is deﬁned as an eﬀective
market order2. The price corresponding to
time t is deﬁned to be just before the event or
transaction occurs, and incremented by one
immediately after that. For AZN about 17%
of events in the data cause immediate trans-
actions (i.e. market buy/sell events). Hence,
for AZN every unit of transaction-time is the
equivalent of roughly 6 event-time units.

III. DECOMPOSING PRICE IMPACT

A. Total price impact

Throughout this paper we work with the
midprice pt, which is deﬁned as the average
pt = 1/2(at + bt), where at is the logarithm
of the best price for a sell order, and bt is the
logarithm of the best price for a buy order.
The total price impact of an event at time t
is deﬁned as the diﬀerence between the price
just before the event and the price τ time
units later, i.e., ∆pT
τ (t) = pt+τ − pt. Letting
st be the sign of an event at time t, we can
merge buy and sell orders together and deﬁne

B. Mechanical impact

We deﬁne the mechanical impact as the
change in the midprice when an event is re-
moved, but all other events are held constant.
Our deﬁnition takes advantage of the fact
that, except for a few restrictions detailed be-
low, under the rules of the continuous double
auction any initial limit order book and sub-
sequent sequence of events generates a unique
price sequence. While mechanical impact is
often discussed (see, e.g. Hopman [16]), to

2 An eﬀective market order may transact with sev-
eral diﬀerent orders in the limit order book. From
the point of view of transaction time we consider
this a single transaction.

our knowledge we are the ﬁrst to oﬀer a pre-
cise deﬁnition.

Let Bt be the limit order book at time
t, consisting of a list of limit orders to buy
or sell. The limit order book is updated by
the arrival of events ωt, which can be eﬀec-
tive market orders, limit orders and cancel-
lations. Given a limit order book Bt,
let
Ωt+1 = {ωt+1, ωt+2, . . . , ωN } be the sequence
of subsequent events. A cancellation event is
ungrammatical if it attempts to cancel an or-
der that doesn’t exist. We call a limit order
book Bt nonempty if it has at least one buy
order and one sell order3. Any pair (Bt, Ωt+1)
results in a well deﬁned sequence of midprices

{pt, pt+1, . . . , pN } = Π(Bt, Ωt+1)

(2)

providing there are no ungrammatical events
and the book is always nonempty. The oper-
ator Π represents the action of the continuous
double auction. Π is a deterministic function
that is easily implemented as a computer al-
gorithm.

The mechanical impact of a given event
ωt
is deﬁned in terms of the diﬀerence in
midprices with and without ωt. Subject to
the proviso of the next paragraph, for times
{t + 1, . . . , t + τ, . . . , N} the mechanical im-
pact {∆pM
τ (t)} is deﬁned as the sequence of
price diﬀerences

{∆pM

τ (t)} = Π(Bt, Ωt+1) − Π(Bt−1, Ωt+1).

(3)
In other words, the mechanical
impact of
ωt is the diﬀerence between the sequence of
real prices and a hypothetical set of prices in
which ωt is removed, but the subsequent se-
quence of events is left the same. This isolates
the part of the price impact that is “purely
mechanical”, in the sense that it is generated

5

solely by the eﬀect of placing an order in the
book and observing its eﬀect under the de-
terministic operation of the continuous dou-
ble auction. Although we have not been able
to prove this, we conjecture that when ωt is
a buy order (st = +1) the continuous double
auction guarantees that ∆pM
τ ≥ 0 for all τ ,
and for sell orders (st = −1) ∆pM
τ ≤ 0. For
τ ≤ 0 the mechanical impact is by deﬁnition
zero.

To reduce this to practice we need to
deal with ungrammatical cancellation events.
Such events occur even in the real data se-
ries, due to the lag between the receipt of
information and the time needed to react
and implement the cancellation, which can
result in an order being executed before it
is cancelled. For AZN, for example, there
are 231 ungrammatical cancellations during
the period of our sample. Removing an or-
der to compute the mechanical impact can
generate additional ungrammatical cancella-
tions. For example, suppose that in the real
event sequence the buy market order ωt re-
moves a sell limit order ˆω. When we gen-
erate the hypothetical sequence by removing
ωt, ˆω is left in the book, so that the best ask
price remains lower than it did in the real
sequence. This can cause a subsequent buy
limit order to be executed that would oth-
erwise have later been cancelled, generating
an ungrammatical event. When ungrammat-
ical cancellations happen we handle them just
the way the exchange handles real ungram-
matical cancellations – we ignore them4. For
AZN, for example, we ﬁnd that about 65% of
the time removing ωt generates no ungram-
matical events for any value of τ , 19% of the
time it generates one ungrammatical event,

3 If the book becomes empty then the midprice is

undeﬁned.

4 More precisely, we replace them by null events, to
preserve the time alignment of the real and hypo-
thetical sequences.

7% of the time it generates two ungrammat-
ical events, etc., so that the average number
of ungrammatical events generated is 0.73.

It is also possible for the real or hypothet-
ical prices to become undeﬁned because the
book is empty on one side, but this is rare in
both cases. For AZN, for example, in 0.01%
of the cases the hypothetical order book be-
comes empty, which is comparable to the real
series, where the book becomes empty 0.003%
of the time. We omit these cases from our
analysis.

Finally, we need to deal with the possi-
bility that the assignment of eﬀective orders
might alter the number of events in the hy-
pothetical series. This can happen, for exam-
ple, because an order that is fully executed
in the real series, and was therefore an eﬀec-
tive market order, is now only partially ex-
ecuted, and so becomes an eﬀective market
order followed by an eﬀective limit order. We
deal with this by preserving the alignment of
the hypothetical and real data series based on
the real events. This prevents the possibility
of a persistent misalignment which could cre-
ate a persistent artiﬁcial price diﬀerence be-
tween the two series. In any case we ﬁnd that
such situations are fairly rare, particularly in
transaction time, where we have done most
of our analysis.

In this paper we study only the impact of
eﬀective market orders. In Figure 1 we show
a typical example comparing a real price se-
quence to a hypothetical price sequence with
a buy order removed5.
It is clear that the

oﬀers computed by the exchange. These do not
always match the prices that we compute by ap-
plying the continuous double auction algorithm to
the event series. For consistency of comparison be-
tween the real and hypothetical series, we use the
latter.

the impact remains at zero and then takes on
nonzero values after more than a thousand
transactions. In other cases there is no me-
chanical impact at all.

C.

Informational impact

The informational impact is deﬁned as the
portion of total impact that cannot be ex-
plained by mechanical impact, i.e.

∆pI

τ = ∆pT

τ − ∆pM
τ .

(4)

Whatever components of the total impact not
explained by mechanical impact must be due
to correlations between the order ωt and other
events. With the data we have it is impossi-
ble to say whether the placement of the or-
der ωt causes changes in future events Ωt+1,
or whether the properties of Ωt+1 are simply
correlated with those of ωt due to a common
cause. In either case, changes in price that are
not caused mechanically must be due to in-
formation – either the information contained
in ωt aﬀecting Ωt+1, or external information
aﬀecting both ωt and Ωt+1. See the discussion
in Section VII A.

IV. EMPIRICAL STUDY OF IMPACT

In this section we perform statistical anal-
ysis of average properties of price impact. For
the remainder of this paper we will only study
the impacts of eﬀective market orders, defer-
ring the problem of studying eﬀective limit
orders and cancellations.

A. Average impact

The ﬁrst property we study is the aver-
age impact as a function of time.

τ (t)it and the average total im-
pact hst∆pT
τ (t)it. For event time the total
impact and mechanical impact are by deﬁni-
tion the same at τ = 1. This is because at
τ = 1 the only event that has occurred is the
reference event ωt, and there is no opportu-
nity for future events to depend on ωt. For
larger values of τ the mechanical and total
impact rapidly diverge. Over the timescale
shown here (100 events), when measured in
units of the average spread, the mechanical

8

impact is initially about 0.17, and then de-
cays monotonically toward zero. In contrast
the total impact increases toward what ap-
pears to be an asymptotically constant value
slightly greater than 0.3. This the source of
our statement that the initial value of me-
chanical impact is about 50% of the asymp-
totic value of the total impact. Similar results
are observed for VOD and LLOY.

Figure 3(b) shows the same behavior in
transaction time. In this case the mechanical
impact and total impact diverge immediately
at τ = 1. This is not surprising, since one in-
crement of transaction time is equivalent to
roughly six increments of event time. The ini-
tial gap between the total and the mechanical
impacts in transaction time is roughly consis-
tent with the results in event time at τ = 6.
Once again, except for statistical ﬂuctuations
the total impact appears to approach a con-
stant value out to τ = 100.

The total

impact of market orders has
received extensive study in several diﬀerent
markets [6, 8, 9, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 23, 24, 25].
Here we focus on the behavior as a function
of time [1, 2, 4, 5, 11, 19, 28]. Our results on
total impact are consistent with previous re-
sults. We ﬁnd that total impact builds with
time and appears to approach a constant,
up to the point where statistical ﬂuctuations
make the results questionable.

In sharp contrast to the total impact, the
mechanical impact decays toward zero. To
get a better view in Figure 4 we plot the av-
erage mechanical impact for times up to 2000
transactions in log-log scale6. We ﬁt a power
law of the form Kτ −λ to what we subjectively
deem to be the asymptotic region of the tail.

6 To make the ﬂuctuations in the data clearer in this
and other ﬁgures, we have placed x’s at diminishing
intervals of time to get a better view in log-log
scale.

For AZN we ﬁnd λ = 1.6, for VOD λ = 1.8,
and for LLOY λ = 1.7. Given that the scaling
region is only over a little more than an order
of magnitude, this is certainly not convincing
evidence that the average mechanical impact
scales as a power law. Nonetheless, plotting
in semi-log coordinates makes it quite clear
that the decay is slower than exponential. We
have not attempted to put any error bars on
these estimates because they are diﬃcult to
assign7. These should just be viewed as rep-
resentative values.

It is clear from simple theoretical argu-
ments that the mechanical impact must de-
cay to zero. From the deﬁnition of Equation 3

problems caused by the slow convergence to asymp-
totic scaling. Careful testing of the power law hy-
pothesis and proper assignment of error bars for
scaling exponents is beyond the scope of this pa-

ries and the hypothetical series with the or-
der removed is the initial order book B. As
orders disappear from the order book the dif-
ference between the real and the hypotheti-
cal price series decreases. Once there are no
orders that were in the original order book
there is no longer any memory of the initial
condition, and there will no longer be any dif-
ference between the real and the hypothetical
price series. Previous studies suggest that the
distribution of times for an order to remain in
the book before being removed by a transac-
tion decays as a power law with an exponent
near 1.5, and that the distribution of times
to cancellation decays as a power law with an
exponent near 2 [3, 22]. These both suggest
that we should expect an asymptotic power
law decay of the average mechanical impact.
Under the rules of the LSE no order can
persist for more than one month, which would
seem to imply an upper bound on the per-
sistence of the mechanical impact. However,
it is quite common for orders to be immedi-
ately replaced, so that from an eﬀective point
of view some orders can persist for very long
times, e.g. six months or more [29]. For prac-
tical reasons related to limitations in compu-
tation time we have not measured the me-
chanical impact for time intervals longer than
2000 transactions, corresponding to a period
of about two trading days. This doesn’t ap-
pear to be an important restriction, since the
average mechanical impact at τ = 2000 is less
than three orders of magnitude less than its
initial value, and events where the mechani-
cal impact is non-zero for τ > 2000 are fairly
rare.

B. Duration and size

We deﬁne the duration of the mechanical
impact of an order as the largest τ for which
that order has a non-zero impact. Figure 5

nents, it is not at all clear that the integrated

V. CORRECTION FOR
LONG-MEMORY

The eﬀect of mechanical impact on prices
is ampliﬁed by the long-memory of the or-
der signs st. Deﬁne P +
τ (t) as the probability
that transactions at time t and t + τ have
the same sign and P −
τ (t) as the probability
that they have the opposite sign. For all
the stock markets examined so far (Paris,
London, NYSE) the sequence of signs has
the autocorrelation func-
long-memory, i.e.
tion decays as a power law τ −γ [1, 2, 11, 19].
This also implies that hP +
τ i − 1 ∼
τ −γ. The exponent γ appears to vary some-
what depending on the market and the stock,
but it is consistently less than one. Long-
memory is illustrated for AZN in Figure 7.
Lillo, Mike, and Farmer [21] hypothesized
that long-memory is caused by strategic order
splitting and presented results supporting the
hypothesis. More recent results that make
use of transaction identity codes strongly sup-

τ i/hP −

The long-memory of order signs creates a
puzzle because it naively suggests that prices
should be ineﬃcient. Figure 7 makes it clear
that order signs are predictable based on
their past history. Given that buyer-initiated
trades have positive price impact and seller-
initiated trades have negative impact, this
suggests that price movements should also
be predictable. This is not the case: price
changes are essentially uncorrelated.

Two explanations have been oﬀered to ex-
plain how transactions can have long-memory
while prices are eﬃcient. One is due to
[1, 2]. They postulate the
Bouchaud et al.
existence of a bare impact function G(τ ),

such that the total

cays as a power law G(τ ) ∼ τ −β, providing
β = (1 − γ)/2, due to the long-memory the
bare impacts will accumulate so that the to-
tal impact asymptotically approaches a con-
stant, i.e. the decay of the bare impact and
the ampliﬁcation due to long-memory cancel
each other. Providing the constant is less
than half the spread (which is observed in
practice), the market is eﬃcient [28].

The temporary nature of the average me-
chanical impact response function shown in
Figure 3 suggests that it might provide a fun-
damental explanation for the decay of the
bare impact G(τ ). However, the average me-
chanical impact decays too fast for this to be
true. According to the formula of the previ-
ous paragraph, using γ = 0.6 implies a bare
propagator exponent of β = 0.2. This is much
smaller than the exponent λ = 1.6 measured
for mechanical impact. Thus it seems that
this cannot be the explanation. Instead, the
full explanation involves the existence of a liq-
uidity imbalance between buying and selling8.

Nonetheless, the decaying nature of the me-
chanical impact may play an important role
in making the bare impact temporary. The
details of this remain to be worked out.

When we compute the mechanical impact,
because the perturbed transaction sequence
and the reference sequence in Equation 3
both have long memory, when we subtract
them any eﬀects due to long-memory dis-
appear. Nonetheless,
it is clear that long-
memory will amplify mechanical impact, for
the same reasons it ampliﬁes the bare im-
pact. The average cumulative mechanical im-
pact C(τ ) taking the ampliﬁcation by long-
memory into account is

In Figure 8(a) we compare the raw me-

cluding ampliﬁcation by long-memory, the
raw informational impact, and the total im-
pact. Plotting the mechanical impact ad-
justed for long-memory on double logarithmic
scale makes it clear that it is still decaying to
zero, albeit slower than the raw mechanical
impact. Fitting a power law to the long-time
behavior of the form Kτ −η, as shown in Fig-
ure 8(b) gives an exponent of about η = 0.6.

buying and selling was oﬀered by Lillo and
Farmer[19] and modiﬁed and demonstrated to be
eﬀective by Farmer et al.
[11]. When buyer-
initiated transactions become more likely, the liq-
uidity for buying increases and the liquidity for sell-
ing decreases (though with some time lag), making
the price responses to buy orders smaller on aver-
age than those to sell orders. This damps the eﬀect
of the long-memory and keeps the market eﬃcient.

VI. CORRELATION BETWEEN
MECHANICAL AND
INFORMATIONAL IMPACTS

We now study the correlation between me-
chanical and informational impact. Because
mechanical
it is not
impact is temporary,
obvious what feature of mechanical impact
is likely to be most important.
Studying
the correlation between mechanical and in-
formational impact is motivated in part by
the idea that prices are informative, i.e. as
agents observe price changes induced by oth-
ers, they update their own information. Since
mechanical impacts are temporary, it is not
clear what others will respond to, particu-
larly if the response is not instantaneous.
We somewhat arbitrarily use the integrated
size, though one could easily argue that other
properties of the mechanical impact might be
more reasonable. See the discussion in Sec-
tion VII A.

In Figure 9 we plot the informational im-
pact at τ = 20 against the size of the mechan-
ical impact integrated up to τ = 20. The re-
lationship for individual transactions is very
noisy, but the positive association between
mechanical and informational impact is quite
clear. The correlation is ρ = 0.14. A linear
regression of the form ∆pI
20(t) = aS20(t) + b
yields a positive slope a = 0.187 ± 0.003. The
error bar corresponds to a t-statistic of 55.
It is computed under the assumption of nor-
mally distributed IID data, which is not valid
in this case and is certainly too optimistic.
Binning the data based on the integrated size
of the mechanical impact makes it clear that
the relationship is essentially monotonically
increasing – large integrated mechanical im-
pacts are associated with large informational
impacts. The positive association between in-
formational and mechanical impacts is clearly
highly statistically signiﬁcant.

based on the integrated mechanical impacts, il-
lustrating that even though the relationship is
noisy, the correlation increases consistently with
increasing size. Note that the black square corre-
sponds to the case where the mechanical impact
is strictly zero.

where the mechanical impact is strictly zero,
the informational
impact has the opposite
sign that one would normally expect, e.g. buy
orders with strictly zero mechanical impact
tend to have negative total price impacts.
(Recall that when the mechanical impact is
zero informational and total impact are the
same). Strictly zero means that the mechan-
ical impact is zero for all times in units of
event-time rather than transaction time, i.e.
it does not include situations where there is
a non-zero impact in event time that dies
out before the ﬁrst transaction. For AZN,
for example, 13% of eﬀective market orders
have strictly zero mechanical impact, in con-
trast to 33% in transaction time. To illus-
trate this in Figure 9(b) we have added the
strictly zero case by placing two values over 0
on the x-axis. The ﬁrst is consistent with the
rest of the ﬁgure and corresponds to SM
20 = 0,
while the other corresponds to the case where
the mechanical impact is strictly zero. The
impact in the latter
average informational
case is hst∆pI
20(t)it = −0.4, in contrast to
the case where SM
20 = 0, which has roughly
hst∆pI
20(t)it = 0. Thus, as soon as there is
any nonzero mechanical impact at all, the
average informational impact jumps from a
strongly negative value to a positive value.

FIG. 10: Informational impact as a function of

for three equal sized quantiles of the transac-
tions with nonzero integrated mechanical impact
S20(t), as well as for all transactions where the
mechanical impact is strictly zero.

tional impact has a slightly positive value at
τ = 1, but then becomes increasingly nega-
tive as τ increases. We hypothesize that this
occurs because orders with no mechanical im-
pact at all tend to be associated with price re-
versals. For example, consider the case where
we remove a buy market order which is too
small to remove the best ask, in a situation in
which the price immediately drops. New sell
orders will ﬁll in below the best ask. In this
case it is very unlikely that removal of the buy
market order will make any diﬀerence to the
midprice. In contrast, had the price contin-
ued to go up, the rearrangement in the level
of sell limit orders triggered by the removal
of the buy market order is much more likely
to generate a perturbation in the price series.

15

VII. SUMMARY

We have introduced a precise deﬁnition of
the mechanical impact of a transaction and
demonstrated how it can be measured. The
time behavior of the mechanical impact is
highly variable. On average, however,
for
market orders it is strongest immediately af-
ter the order is placed, and then decays to
zero over time.
It is initially the dominant
component of the total price impact, but the
relative fraction decreases as the mechanical
impact shrinks and the informational impact
grows to approach its asymptotic value. Ini-
tially the mechanical impact is about half as
large as the asymptotic informational impact.

A. Causality

We have deﬁned the informational impact
as what is left over of the total impact once
the purely mechanical
impact is removed.
The justiﬁcation for this is that the remain-
der depends on correlations between events.
I.e., unless there is something correlating the
information in the reference event ωt to the
subsequent sequence of events Ωt + 1, there
will be no informational impact. This leaves
open the question of causality. One hypoth-
esis is that event ωt causes changes in the
subsequent events Ωt+1. The alternative hy-
pothesis is that there is a common cause for
ωt and any aspects of Ωt+1 that are correlated
with its presence. Based on the information
available here we cannot distinguish these two
hypotheses.

The idea of a common cause is easy to un-
derstand. Suppose, for example, that an ex-
ternal event causes a group of investors to
decide to buy, and they submit a series of
buy orders without paying any attention to
each other. This will cause a rise in price
associated with each buy order, due both to

the mechanical impact of each buy order, and
the mechanical impact of all the buy orders
that are correlated with it. The correlated
part of the price rise will be measured as an
informational impact (reﬂecting the external
information).

The causal hypothesis is more interesting,
and is connected to the role of trading and its
associated price changes in transmitting in-
formation. In a world where individual agents
have private information, trading provides a
mechanism for disseminating that informa-
tion. If an agent receives new private infor-
mation, this may cause him or her to trade.
Trading aﬀects the price, which is visible to
everyone. An intelligent agent with diﬀerent
information will observe the change in price,
and will infer that his or her valuation must
be wrong. As a result, each agent will arrive
at a valuation that is based partly on private
information and partly on price and other
public information. Prices are thus a mech-
anism for making private information public.
This idea is well-accepted in economic theory
[12, 13].

Insofar as the causal hypothesis is correct,
the temporary nature of mechanical impact
suggests that private information is made
public through a highly dynamic process. As
each trade happens, it causes a mechanical
impact, which is a signal visible to all. Before
it decays away, it can cause other trades of the
same sign to occur, or it can cause cancella-
tions to occur, or (probably most important)
it can cause changes in the limit prices of sub-
sequent orders. Each of these events has its
own mechanical impact, creating a cascade
of impacts giving rise to a permanent change.
The avalanche-like nature of this process sug-
gests possible analogies to self-organized crit-
icality.

At this stage we are unable to say to what
extent common cause or causality are at play.
It seems likely that both are acting. We do

16

know that these series display long-memory,
and as discussed in Section V, evidence sug-
gests that this is essentially an exogenous
phenomenon, which from this point of view is
a common cause boosting the informational
impact.

B. Generalizations

The mechanical impact can be deﬁned in
a way that is more general than what we have
presented here. We have deﬁned mechanical
impact by fully removing an event, but there
are many other possible modiﬁcations of the
order book that are worth considering. Equa-
tion 3 can be generalized to read

{∆pM

τ (t)} = Π(Bt, Ωt+1) − Π( ˜B, Ωt+1)

(6)

where Bt is the real order book at time t and
˜B is any modiﬁcation of it that may yield a
useful interpretation. For example, ˜B might
be the true order book with an additional
order added, or it could be an inﬁnitesimal
modiﬁcation of a given order, e.g. with the
size of the most recent order ωt slightly en-
hanced or diminished. This potentially al-
lows one to make a quasi-continuous analy-
sis, eﬀectively estimating the derivative of the

mechanical changes in prices with respect to
changes in supply or demand.

C. Future work

We have left many questions unanswered
In addition to the generaliza-
in this work.
tion discussed above, there are many topics
that remain to be investigated. For example,
what is the dependence of mechanical impact
on the size of orders? Previous results have
shown that the total impact is remarkably in-
dependent of order size [10, 27]; is this also
true for mechanical impact? Is the mechani-
cal impact symmetric under increases or de-
creases in the size of ωt? What does the price
impact of cancellation and limit orders look
like? We hope to investigate these and other
questions in the future.

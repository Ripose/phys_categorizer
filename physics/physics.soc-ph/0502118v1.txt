Abstract

Numerical simulations are reported on the Bonabeau model on a fully
connected graph, where spatial degrees of freedom are absent. The control
parameter is the memory factor f . The phase transition is observed at the
dispersion of the agents power hi. The critical value fC shows a hysteretic
behavior with respect to the initial distribution of hi. fC decreases with
the system size; this decrease can be compensated by a greater number
of ﬁghts between a global reduction of the distribution width of hi. The
latter step is equivalent to a partial forgetting.

Introduction

The game theory is considered to be mathematical formulation of theory of
conﬂicts [1]. Since its initialization by von Neumann and Morgenstern in 1946
[2], it becomes a powerful branch of knowledge, with numerous links to other
areas of science. Oﬀering new insight into old problems, these links allow to
widen our perspective to new interdisciplinary applications.

Such is the concept of self-organizing hierarchies in animal societies, intro-
duced by Bonabeau et. al. in 1995 [3]. In the Bonabeau model, N agents walk
randomly on a given area and ﬁght when they met. Initially, the outcome of
ﬁghts is random. However, agents are able to remember for some time their
past results and this memory inﬂuences their subsequent ﬁghts. Then, there
are two competitive mechanisms. First, each ﬁght inﬂuences the agents’ power:
winner is stronger and looser is weaker, what alters the probabilities of winning
of their future ﬁghts. Second, the information of these alterations is gradually
erased. As a consequence, a phase transition can be observed: for a given ve-
locity of forgetting, frequent ﬁghts produce a hierarchy of permanent winners
and permanent loosers. This hierarchy is maintained in time. However, if ﬁghts
are rare, the hierarchy is being forgotten quicker, than it is reproduced. The
frequency of ﬁghts depends on the number of ﬁghters on a given area. The
order parameter is the dispersion of power of the agents, or the dispersion of
probabilities of winning/loosing of pairs of agents. The phase transition was
termed in [4] as the one between hierarchical and egalitarian society. Besides

1

its sociological associations, the Bonabeau model oﬀers nontrivial dynamics of
a speciﬁc, time-dependent spontaneous symmetry breaking, which — in our
opinion — deserves attention from a theoretical point of view. Unfortunately,
numerical experiments described in Ref. [4] have shown that the order and even
the appearance of the phase transition depends on a direct way of forgetting, i.e.
the time dependence of the agents’ power, and on the presence of mean-ﬁeld-like
coupling which is absent in Ref. [3].

A reasonable strategy of resolving this puzzle seems to separate it to ele-
ments as simple as possible, and to observe their properties. Here we propose
a formulation where the spatial coordinates of agents are absent. Instead, the
agents are placed at nodes of a fully connected graph, i.e. each agent can meet
every other agent. Scale free networks were mentioned in [5]. In next section
the applied procedure is described in detail. Numerical results are reported and
concluded in two subsequent sections.

2 The model

Two ﬁghters i and j are selected randomly from a population of N agents. The
probability that i-th agent wins over j-th is

P (i, j, t) =

1
1 + exp{σ(t)[hj(t) − hi(t)]}

where hi is the power of i-th agent at time t and

σ2(t) = hh2

i (t)i − hhi(t)i2,

(1)

(2)

where h· · · i is the average over N agents. As an output of the ﬁght, the power
hi of the winner increases by ε and the one of the looser decreases by ε.

Every Nf steps (i.e. ﬁghts), the powers hi of all agents are multiplied by
the factor (1 − f ), where f ∈ (0, 1). This is the step of ‘forgetting’. As often as
forgetting procedure takes place the current value of dispersion σ is evaluated
which is then ﬁxed during next Nf ﬁghts. The number of such updates of σ is
Niter. Then, the total number of ﬁghts during one simulation is Nf Niter.

3 Results

The parameters of the calculations are: the system size N , the number of ﬁghts
Nf between the subsequent updates of σ, the number of steps Niter and the
change ε of the power hi. The initial distribution of hi appears also to be
relevant. This is set either random (hi ∈ [−N/2, N/2]), or homogeneous, i.e.
hi = iε for all i, or delta-like, i.e. hi = 0 for all i. We keep ε = 0.01. The output
of the simulation is the critical value of f , i.e. fC, where σ changes abruptly.
We can speak about ‘hierarchical’ (large σ) or ‘egalitarian’ (small σ) society. As
a rule, for small f we get hierarchy, and for large f — equality.

It appears that fC depends on the ratio between N and Nf . Keeping Nf
constant and increasing N , we make forgetting more and more relevant, because
each agent ﬁghts less between subsequent forgettings. Then, the critical value
fC decreases with N , as shown in Fig. 1(a). We can compensate this variation,
changing Nf and N simultaneously as to keep fC constant. Two series of this

2

procedure are shown in Figs. 1(b) and 1(c), for fC = 0.3 and fC = 0.5. In Fig.
2, we show two respective curves of Nf against N .

We note that the obtained values of σ are stable vs time, because the distri-
bution of the agent’s power hi stabilize after some transient time. Examples of
this dynamics are shown in Fig. 3 for various values of the parameters.

According to what was said above, the system size of the critical value of
forgetting parameter fC (N ) decreases to zero for large N . The character of this
variation is shown in Fig. 4. It is likely that there is a power-like behavior, i.e.
fC ∝ N −α, with α ≈ 0.88. Thus we cannot exlcude α = 1 asymptotically.

For small systems, the ﬁnal value of σ does not depend on the initial distri-
bution of hi. However, above N = 175 the ﬁnal distribution of hi shows some
hysteretic behavior, i.e. σ does depend on initial values of hi. In Fig. 5 we show
the curves σ(f ) obtained for random, homogeneous or delta-like initial values of
hi. The curves, identical for N < 175, split abruptly for larger systems. On the
contrary, we checked that the hysteretic eﬀect is not observed in the approach
in Ref. [4], at least near the critical point reported there.

4 Discussion

In their seminal paper [3], the authors put several examples and suggestions on
societies, which could self-organize into the hierarchical state. There, reference
are given on animal societies, like bees, wasps, ants, chickens, cows and ponies.
A question arises how important are spatial degrees of freedom in these societies.
This is a central task for our considerations, because the territorial aspect of the
problem of hierarchy is disregarded here, while it was included in earlier work.
It seems that in small groups of some animals, the diﬀerence in hierarchy is not
to be here or there but rather to do this or that. This is particularly true in
societies of some primates, as Pan troglodytes, Homo sapiens or Gorilla gorilla
[6, 7, 8].

The Bonabeau model, once released, lives with its own life as it provides
nontrivial questions on its mathematical properties. However, its core is the so-
ciological application: description of a group of agents, possibly human, which
concentrate on their hierarchy. How important is this hierarchy for them, de-
pends on their experience and social environment. Except army and some uni-
versities, we are interested in formation of a society rather egalitarian than
hierarchical, and tasks of educational organizations following this attitude are
well known [9]. In the Bonabeau model, these eﬀorts get a well-deﬁned purpose:
to be on the right side of the transition.

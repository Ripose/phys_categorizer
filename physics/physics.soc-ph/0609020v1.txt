Abstract

We present a preferential attachment growth model to obtain the distribution P (K) of number

of units K in the classes which may represent business ﬁrms or other socio-economic entities. We

found that P (K) is described in its central part by a power law with an exponent ϕ = 2 + b/(1

b)

−

which depends on the probability of entry of new classes, b.

In a particular problem of city

population this distribution is equivalent to the well known Zipf law. In the absence of the new

classes entry, the distribution P (K) is exponential. Using analytical form of P (K) and assuming

proportional growth for units, we derive P (g), the distribution of business ﬁrm growth rates. The

model predicts that P (g) has a Laplacian cusp in the central part and asymptotic power-law tails

with an exponent ζ = 3. We test the analytical expressions derived using heuristic arguments by

simulations. The model might also explain the size-variance relationship of the ﬁrm growth rates.

INTRODUCTION

Gibrat [1, 2], building upon the work of the astronomer Kapteyn [3], assumed the expected

value of the growth rate of a business ﬁrm’s size to be proportional to the current size of the

ﬁrm, which is called “Law of Proportionate Eﬀect” [4, 5]. Several models of proportional

growth have been subsequently introduced in economics in order to explain the growth of

business ﬁrms [6, 7, 8]. Simon and co-authors [9, 10, 11, 12] extended Gibrat’s model by

introducing an entry process according to which the number of ﬁrms rise over time.

In

Simon’s framework, the market consists of a sequence of many independent “opportunities”

which arise over time, each of size unity. Models in this tradition have been challenged by

many researchers [13, 14, 15, 16, 17] who found that the ﬁrm growth distribution is not

Gaussian but displays a tent shape.

Here we introduce a mathematical framework that provides an unifying explanation for

the growth of business ﬁrms based on the number and size distribution of their elementary

constituent components [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]. Speciﬁcally we present a model of

proportional growth in both the number of units and their size and we draw some general

implications on the mechanisms which sustain business ﬁrm growth [7, 11, 21, 26, 27, 28].

According to the model, the probability density function (PDF) of growth rates, P (g) is
Laplace [29] in the center [13] with power law tails [30, 31] decaying as g−ζ where ζ = 3.

Two key sets of assumptions in the model are described in subsections A (the number

of units K in a class grows in proportion to the existing number of units) and B (the

size of each unit ﬂuctuates in proportion to its size). Our goal is to ﬁrst ﬁnd P (K), the

probability distribution of the number of units in the classes at large t, and then ﬁnd

P (g)usingtheconvolutionof P(K) and the conditional distribution of the class growth rates

P (g

K), which for large K converges to a Gaussian..

II. ANALYTICAL RESULTS

A. The Proportional Growth of Number of Units

The ﬁrst set of assumptions [32] is:

(A1) Each class α consists of Kα(t) number of units. At time t = 0, there are N(0) classes

2

consisting of n(0) total number of units. The initial average number of units in a class

is thus n(0)/N(0).

n(t) = n(0) + t.

(A2) At each time step a new unit is created. Thus the number of units at time t is

(A3) With birth probability b, this new unit is assigned to a new class, so that the average

number of classes at time t is N(t) = N(0) + bt.

(A4) With probability 1

b, a new unit is assigned to an existing class α with probability

−

Pα = (1

b)Kα(t)/n(t), so Kα(t + 1) = Kα(t) + 1.

−

This model can be generalized to the case when the units are born at any unit of time t′

with probability µ, die with probability λ, and in addition a new class consisting of one unit
can be created with probability b′ [32]. This model can be reduced to the present model if
λ + b′) and probability b = b′/(µ
one introduce time t = t′(µ

λ + b′).

−

−

Our goal is to ﬁnd P (K), the probability distribution of the number of units in the classes

at large t. This model in two limiting cases (i) b = 0, Kα = 1 (α = 1, 2 . . . N(0)) and (ii)

b

= 0, N(0) = 1, n(0) = 1 has exact analytical solutions P (K) = N(0)/t(t/(t + N(0)))K(1 +

O(1/t)) [33, 34] and lim
t→∞

P (K) = (1 + b)Γ(K)Γ(2 + b)/Γ(K + 2 + b) [35] respectively, In

general, an exact analytical solution of this problem cannot be presented in a simple close

form. Accordingly, we seek for an approximate mean-ﬁeld type [36] solution which can be

expressed in simple integrals and even in elementary functions in some limiting cases. First

we will present a known solution of the preferential attachment model in the absence of the

inﬂux of new classes [37]:

Pold(K) = λK

−

(1)

where λ = 1

1/K(t) and K(t) = [n(0) + t]/N(0) is the average number of units in the old

−

classes at time t. Note that the form of the distribution of units in the old classes remains

unchanged even in the presence of the new classes, whose creation does not change the

preferential attachment mechanism of the old classes and aﬀects only the functional form of

K(t).

Now we will treat the problem in the presence of the inﬂux of the new classes. Assume

that at the beginning there are N(0) classes with n(0) units. Because at every time step,

3

6
one unit is added to the system and a new class is added with probability b, at moment t

there are

units and approximately

classes, among which there are approximately bt new classes with nnew units and N(0) old

classes with nold units, such that

Because of the preferential attachment assumption (A4), we can write, neglecting ﬂuctua-

tions [36] and assuming that t, nold, and nnew are continuous variables:

n(t) = n(0) + t

N(t) = N(0) + bt

nold + nnew = n(0) + t.

nold
n(0) + t

.

Solving the second diﬀerential equation and taking into account initial condition nold(0) =
n(0), we obtain nold(t) = (n(0) + t)1−b n(0)b. Analogously, the number of units at time t in

the classes existing at time t0 is

ne(t0, t) = (n(0) + t)1−b(n(0) + t0)b

where the subscript ‘e’ means “existing”. Accordingly, the average number of units in old

classes is

K(t) =

nold(t)
N(0)

=

(n(0) + t)1−b
N(0)

n(0)b.

Thus according to Eq. (1), the distribution of units in the old classes is

(cid:19)
and the contribution of the old classes to the distribution of all classes is

(cid:18)

˜Pold(K) = Pold(K)N(0)/(N(0) + bt).

(10)

The number of units in the classes that appear at t0 is b dt and the number of these classes is

b dt. Because the probability that a class captures a new unit is proportional to the number

of units it has already gotten at time t, the number of units in the classes that appear at

time t0 is

nnew(t0, t) = ne(t0, t)bdt/[n(0) + t0].

The average number of units in these classes is

K(t0, t) = nnew(t0, t)/b dt = (n(0) + t)1−b/(n(0) + t0)1−b.

Assuming that the distribution of units in these classes is given by a continuous approxima-

tion (1) we have

which always decays faster than Eq. (9) because n(0)
N(0) and there is an additional
factor K −1 in front of the exponential. Thus the behavior of the distribution of all classes

≥

is dominated for large K by the exponential decay of the distribution of units in the old

classes.

Note that Eq. (9) and Eq. (15) are not exact solutions but continuous approximations

which assume K is a real number. This approximation produces the most serious discrepancy

for small K. To test this approximation, we perform numerical simulations of the model for

b = 0.1, N(0) = n(0) = 10000 and t = 400000. The results are presented in Fig.1. While

the agreement is excellent for large K, Eq. (15) signiﬁcantly underestimates the value of
˜Pnew(K) for K = 1 and K = 2. Note that in reality the power-law behavior of ˜Pnew(K)

extends into the region of very small K.

B. The Proportional Growth of Size of Units

The second set of assumptions of the model is:

(B1) At time t, each class α has Kα(t) units of size ξi(t), i = 1, 2, ...Kα(t) where Kα and

ξi > 0 are independent random variables taken from the distributions P (Kα) and

Pξ(ξi) respectively. P (Kα) is deﬁned by Eq. (17) and Pξ(ξi) is a given distribution

(B2) At time t + 1, the size of each unit is decreased or increased by a random factor

ηi(t) > 0 so that

ξi(t + 1) = ξi(t) ηi(t),

(23)

where ηi(t), the growth rate of unit i, is independent random variable taken from a

distribution Pη(ηi), which has ﬁnite mean and standard deviation. We also assume
that ln ηi has ﬁnite mean µη ≡ h

crossover to the theoretical value β = 0.5, (Fig. 3). Finally, the simulated distribution of

P (g

model growth rates may explain the abundance of the tent-shaped wings of the growth rates

of various systems in nature. The most drastic discrepancy between the Gaussian shape

the summation in Eq. (28) by integration and replace the distributions P (K) by Eq. (9) and

where K(t) is the average number of units in the old classes (see Eq. (8)). This distribution

decays as 1/g3 and thus does not have a ﬁnite variance. In spite of drastic assumptions that

we make, Eq. (38) correctly predicts the shape of the convolution Pold(g). Figure 5 shows

the comparison of the simulation of the growth rates in the system with the exponential

distribution of units P (K) with K(t) = 215 and the same empirical parameters of the

unit size and growth distributions as before. The parameter of the analytical distribution

characterizing its width (variance does not exist), must be taken V = 33 which is much

smaller than the analytical prediction V = 73.23. This is not surprising, since for K = 215

Kσ2(K) = 50 (see Fig. 2b). Moreover, since we are dealing with the average σ2(K)K for

K < 215, we can expect V < 50. Nevertheless the nature of the power-law wings decaying

as 1/g3 is reproduced very well.

III. CONCLUSIONS

The analytical solution of this model can be obtained only for certain limiting cases but

a numerical solution can be easily computed for any set of assumptions. We investigate the

model numerically and analytically (see and ﬁnd:

be derived for our model using elementary considerations. Indeed, due to proportional

growth the rank of a class, R, is proportional to the time of its creation t0. The

number of units n(t0) existing at time t0 is also proportional to t0 and thus also

proportional to R. According to the proportional growth, the ratio of the number of

∼

∼

units in this class to the number of units in the classes existed at time t0 is constant:

K(t0, t)/ne(t0, t) = 1/n(t0).

If we assume that the amount of units in the classes,

created after t0 can be neglected since the inﬂux of new classes b is small, we can

approximate ne(t0, t)

n(t)

(2) The conditional distribution of the logarithmic growth rates P (g

K) for the classes

consisting of a ﬁxed number K of units converges to a Gaussian distribution (35)

12

for K

. Thus the width of this distribution, σ(K), decreases as 1/K β, with

→ ∞

β = 1/2. Note that due to slow convergence of lognormals to the Gaussian in case

of wide lognormal distribution of unit sizes Vξ = 5.13, computed from the empirical

data [39], we have β = 0.2 for relatively small classes. This result is consistent with

the observation that large ﬁrms with many production units ﬂuctuate less than small

ﬁrms [7, 18, 22, 38]. Interestingly, in case of large V ξ, P (g

K) converges to the Gaus-

sian in the central interval which grows with K, but outside this interval it develops

tent-shape wings, which are becoming increasingly wider, as K

. However, they

|

→ ∞

remain limited by the distibution of the logarithmic growth rates of the units, Pη(ln η).

(3) For g

Vη, the distribution P (g) coincides with the distribution of the logarithms of

the growth rates of the units:

for all g. Indeed, empirical observations of Ref. [39] conﬁrm this result.

In conclusion we want to emphasize that although the derivations of the distributions (38),

especially the 1/g3 behavior of the wings of the distribution of the growth rates and the

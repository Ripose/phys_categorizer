We investigate the waiting-time distribution of the absolute return in the Korean stock-market
index KOSPI. We deﬁne the waiting time as a time interval during which the normalized absolute
return remains continuously below a threshold rc. Through an exponential bin plot, we observe
that the waiting-time distribution shows power-law behavior, pf (t) ∼ t−β, for a range of threshold
values. The waiting-time distribution has two scaling regimes, separated by the crossover time
tc ≈ 200 min. The power-law exponents of the waiting-time distribution decrease when the return
time ∆t increases. In the late-time regime, t > tc, the power-law exponents are independent of the
threshold to within the error bars for ﬁxed return time.

INTRODUCTION

In recent decades, the dynamics of stock markets have
been studied by a number of methods from statistical
physics [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,
16, 17, 18]. The complex behaviors of economic systems
have been found to be very similar to those of other com-
plex systems, customarily studied in statistical physics;
in particular, critical phenomena. Stock-market indexes
around the world have been precisely recorded for many
years and therefore represent a rich source of data for
quantitative analysis. The dynamic behaviors of stock
markets have been studied by various methods, such as
distribution functions [10, 11, 12, 13, 17], correlation
functions [12, 13, 14], multifractal analysis [19, 20, 21,
22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30], network analysis [15],
and waiting-time distributions or ﬁrst-return-time distri-
butions [31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43].
Waiting-time distributions (wtd’s) have been studied
for many physical phenomena and systems, such as self-
organized criticality [31], rice piles [32], sand piles [33],
solar ﬂares [34], and earthquakes [35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40,
41]. Studies of wtd’s have also been performed for many
high-frequency ﬁnancial data sets [42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47].
Concepts of the continuous-time random walk (CTRW)
have also been applied to stock markets [42, 43, 44, 45,
46]. A power-law distribution for the calm time intervals
of the price changes has been observed in the Japanese
stock market [47].

In the present work we consider the wtd for the Korean
stock-market index KOSPI (Korean Composite Stock

Price Index). A waiting time of the absolute return is
deﬁned as an interval between a time when the absolute
return falls below a ﬁxed threshold rc, and the next time
it again exceeds rc. It therefore corresponds to a rela-
tively calm period in the time series of the stock index.
We observed power-law behavior of the wtd over one to
two decades in time.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Sec-
tion II, we introduce the return of the stock index and its
probability density function. In Section III, we present
the wtd. Concluding remarks are presented in section
IV.

II. RETURN OF THE STOCK INDEX

We investigate the returns (or price changes) of the Ko-
rean stock-market index KOSPI. The data are recorded
every minute of trading from March 30, 1992, through
November 30, 1999 in the Korean stock market. We
count the time during trading hours and remove closing
hours, weekends, and holidays from the data. Denoting
the stock-market index as p(t), the logarithmic return is
deﬁned by

g(t) = log p(t) − log p(t − ∆t) ,

(1)

where ∆t is the time interval between two data points,
the so-called return time. The logarithmic return g(t)
is thus a function of both t and ∆t. In this article we
consider the return times ∆t = 1min, 10 min, 30 min,
60 min, 600 min (=1day), and 1200 min. The normalized
absolute return is deﬁned by

threshold rc = 1.0 for the return time ∆t = 1 min. The
randomly shuﬄed data were obtained by exchanging two
randomly selected return, repeating the exchanges one
hundred times the total number of data points. The wtd
of the absolute return shows the power law,

pf (t) ∼ t−β ,

(5)

where the scaling exponent β depends on the return time
∆t. However, the randomly shuﬄed data lose the cor-
relations of the original time series, and the uncorre-
lated wtd is therefore a simple exponential distribution,
pf (t) = 1
hT i exp(−t/hT i), where hT i is the mean waiting
time for the given threshold rc.

It is well known
that the probability distribution function (pdf) of the
return g(t) has a fat tail [10, 11]. The tail of the pdf
obeys a power law,

p(x) ∼ x−(1+α) ,

where α is a nonuniversal scaling exponent that depends
on the return time ∆t. The cumulative pdf then also
follows a power law, such that

We observed clear power-law behavior in the tail of the
pdf. Using least-squares ﬁts, we obtained the power-law
exponents α = 3.06(8) for ∆t = 1 min and α = 3.2(4)
for ∆t = 600 min.

III. WAITING-TIME DISTRIBUTION

Consider a time series of the absolute return in the
stock-market index. The waiting time of the absolute
return with a threshold rc is deﬁned as an interval be-
tween a time when the absolute return falls below a ﬁxed
threshold rc, and the next time it again exceeds rc. It
corresponds to a calm period in the time series of the
stock index. The waiting times depend on the threshold
rc and the pdf of the absolute return. For small return
times, for example ∆t = 1 min as in Fig. 1, the abso-
lute return is distributed in a wide range up to r = 500.
However, for large return times, the absolute return is
distributed in a narrow range. For large values of the
threshold rc, the waiting time has very long time inter-
vals. For small values of the threshold rc, the waiting
time has many short time intervals.

In Fig. 1 we present the wtd of the absolute return
for the original data set of KOSPI, together with a ran-
domly shuﬄed data set. Both sets were analyzed with the

In the wtd in Fig. 1, the data are sparsely distributed in
the tail, so it it diﬃcult to measure the scaling exponents
of the power law. To calculate the scaling exponents,
we have therefore applied the exponential bin plot [48].
In the exponential bin plot, we calculate the normalized
histogram in bins of exponentially increasing size. If the
distribution follows a power law with exponent β, then
the histogram of the distribution also has the same slope
log pf (t) = C −
β in the log-log exponential bin plot:
β log t, where C is a constant depending on the return
time and the threshold.

In Fig. 2 we present the wtd obtained using the ex-
ponential bin plot for the return time ∆t = 1 min. We
observe clear power-law behavior t > tc, where tc is a
crossover time. For a small return time, ∆t = 1 min, we
observe two scaling regimes separated by a crossover time
tc ≈ 200 min. In the log-log plots the curves for rc = 1.0
to rc = 3.0 are parallel to each other for t < tc, and
the slope is measured as β1 = 1.48(3). For t < tc and
rc ≥ 4.0, the wtd decreases quicker than a power law
and shows a local maximum around t = tc. When we
choose a large threshold value rc, for example rc = 8.0,
the wtd is still large for small waiting times. This means
that the return has clustering behavior, i.e., large abso-
lute returns occur in bursts. For t > tc, the wtd shows

power-law behavior with similar exponents, regardless of
the threshold. When the threshold rc is large, the total
number of data points for the wtd decrease. Therefore,
the wtd ﬂuctuates much and the uncertainty in the ex-
ponent β2 increases.

The power-law exponents of the wtd are measured by
least-squares ﬁts. In Table 1 we present the exponents
β2 for t > tc. To measure the exponents, we scaled the
wtd by the average waiting time hT i =
tpf (t)dt. We
present the wtd scaled by the average waiting time in
Fig. 3 for ∆t = 1 min. The scaled wtd shows clear
power-law behavior. For a given return time, the ex-
ponents β2 are nearly equal within the error bars, re-
gardless of the threshold rc. We also observe that the ex-
ponents β2 decrease when the return time ∆t increases.
We obtained the averaged exponents β2 for the wtd as
β2 = 2.0 for ∆ = 1 min, 1.58 for ∆t = 60 min, and
1.42 for ∆t = 600 min. It is very diﬃcult to identify the
origins of the scaling behavior for the wtd. The correla-
tion of the return is one reason of the scaling behavior
as shown in Fig. 1, because the shuﬄed data set destroys
the correlation of the time series. The power-law behav-
ior of the probability density function for the absolute
return is another reason for the scaling behavior of the

wtd. These power-law behaviors may be due to herding
behavior of the stock traders and the nonlinear dynamics
of the stock market.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have considered the probability density function
of the absolute return and the waiting-time distribution
(wtd) with a cut-oﬀ threshold. We observed that the
probability density function of the absolute return has
a power-law behavior. The exponents α decrease when
the return time ∆t increases. We deﬁned the waiting
time of the absolute return by the threshold rc. The wtd
also shows power-law behavior. When the return time
∆t is less than one day, we observe two scaling regimes,
separated by a crossover time around tc ≈ 200 min.

We study the dynamical behavior of high-frequency data from the Korean Stock Price Index
(KOSPI) using the movement of returns in Korean ﬁnancial markets. The dynamical behavior for a
binarized series of our models is not completely random. The conditional probability is numerically
estimated from a return series of KOSPI tick data. Non-trivial probability structures can be consti-
tuted from binary time series of autoregressive (AR), logit, and probit models, for which the Akaike
Information Criterion shows a minimum value at the 15th order. From our results, we ﬁnd that the
value of the correct match ratio for the AR model is slightly larger than the ﬁndings of other models.

Recent investigation of diﬀerently scaled economic
systems has been received a considerable attention as
an interdisciplinary ﬁeld of physicists and economists
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. One of challenging issues is to test
eﬃcient market hypotheses from the perspective of em-
pirical observations and theoretical considerations. To
exploit or predict the dynamical behavior of continuous
tick data for various ﬁnancial assets [9, 10] is extremely
desirable. Financial eﬃciency and predictability can sig-
niﬁcantly beneﬁt investors or agents in the ﬁnancial mar-
ket and successfully reinforce the eﬀective network be-
tween them. For example, when the price of stock rises
or falls in the stock market, a trader’s decision to buy or
sell is inﬂuenced by various strategies, external informa-
tion, and other traders. One such strategy is to apply
the up and down movement of returns to a correlation
function and the conditional probability. This strategy,
which is pivotal for predicting an investment, is a useful
tool for understanding the stock transactions of company
whose stock price is rising or falling. In the literature,
Ohira et al. [9] mainly discussed conditional probability
and the correct match ratio of high-frequency data for
the yen-dollar exchange rate; they showed that such dy-
namics is not completely random and that a probabilistic
structure exists. Sazuka et al. [10] used the order k = 10
of the Akaike Information Criterion (IC) to determine
the predictable value of the autoregressive (AR) model;
in contrast, they numerically calculated the 5th order of
the logit model [11]. Motivated by such research, we ap-
ply and analyze novelly the AR, logit, and probit models
to the Korean ﬁnancial market, which, in contrast to ac-
tive and well-established ﬁnancial markets, is now in a
slightly unstable and risky state.

Interest in nonlinear models has recently grown, par-
ticularly in the social, natural, medical, and engineering
sciences. Statistical and mathematical physics provides
a powerful and rigorous tool for analyzing social data.
Moreover, several papers have focused on social phenom-
ena models based on aspects of stochastic analysis, such
as the diﬀusion, master, Langevin, and Fokker-Planck
equations. Many researchers in econometrics or biomet-
rics have proposed the use of AR, logit, and probit mod-
els in the formulation of the discrete choices, including
binary analysis. Interestingly, Nakayama and Nakamura
[16] associated the fashion phenomena of the bandwagon
and snob eﬀects with the logit model. To our knowledge,
in addition to the Akaike IC, there are at least two other
similar standards such as the Hannan-Quinn IC and the
Schwarz IC. However, we restrict ourselves to ﬁnd the
Akaike IC as the residual test in order to minimize the
remained value for binary analysis. Moreover, after cal-
culating the binary structures and their Akaike IC value,
we compute the correct match ratio, or the power of pre-
dictability. Although the dynamical behavior of logit and
probit models has been calculated and analyzed in scien-
tiﬁc ﬁelds such as mathematics, economics, and econo-
physics, until now these models have not been studied in
detail with respect to ﬁnancial markets

In this letter, we present the future predictability func-
tion of the AR, logit, and probit models, by using the tick
data analysis of the Korean Stock Price Index (KOSPI)
for the Korean ﬁnancial market. By examining the bi-
nary phenomena of a ﬁnancial time series in terms of
the nontrivial probability distribution, we show that the
high-frequency data of our model follows a special con-
ditional probability structure for the up and down move-

tance for making a powerful and capable tool that can be
used to investigate properties of eﬃcient and predictable

To analyze the correlation function and the conditional
probability, we introduce our underlying asset into the
KOSPI in the Korean ﬁnancial market. First, we consider
two delivery periods: the ﬁrst set of data, Data A, was
from January 1997 to December 1998; the second set,
Data B, was from January 2004 to December 2004. The
lag time of two sets of tick data is about one minute. Data
A contains 133, 823 items of data and Data B contains
86, 561 items.

From the two tick data, we computed two series: the
X(t) series and the Z(t) series, where Z(t) represents a
one-dimensional zigzag motion. This computation refers

to a binary strategy of the buy and sell trend of traders
in ﬁnancial markets. Fig. 1 plots the correlation function
,C(u), which we obtained from the return change D(t).
The plot suggests that the minutely returns for Data A of
the KOSPI are not entirely independent of, or diﬀerent
from, the random walk model but almost independent
for long periods. Given the probabilistic structure of our
model, we can deduce from the correlation function that
the dynamical behavior is completely nonrandom.

By quantitative analysis, we can relate the X(t) series
to conditional probability. To analyze the high-frequency
data of the KOSPI, we concentrated on the up and down
return movements in terms of conditional probability.
The parameter P (+

ability that a tend in the price returns is likely to move in
the same direction; that is, that the price is likely to rise
after two consecutive steps in the same direction. Table

buy-sell strategy of dealers who can change in a few min-
utes. Note that although Data A and Data B share a
signiﬁcant similarity, we cannot understand the behavior
of these data sets from a random walk model that has
ﬁxed values for conditional probabilities.

For simplicity, we used the AR, logit, and probit mod-
els to analyze the X(t) series for high-frequency tick data

4

of the Korean ﬁnancial market. As shown in Fig. 4, we
found that the Akaike IC values for the AR and logit
models decrease gradually as the order of the models in-
creases.Because the Akaike IC for the three models has
approximately the same value in a range larger than the
order of k = 15, we consider this value to be the mini-
mum value; in addition, this value is similar to the 10th
order of the AR model of the yen-dollar exchange rate
[11]. Hence, the function shape of the logit model is sim-
ilar to that of the probit model, and each probability
structure tends to move continuously in the same direc-
tion. By minimizing the Akaike IC value of our model,
we were also able to calculate the correct match ratio.
Table 2 shows the values of the correct match ratios for
Data A and Data B. The AR model of Data A has a
higher value than other models for the correct match ra-
tio; in contrast, the logit model of Data B has a smaller
value.

In conclusion, we used the AR, logit, and probit models
to determine the probability structure of high-frequency
tick data of the KOSPI in the Korean ﬁnancial market.
The value of our conditional probability of the KOSPI

is slightly greater than that of the yen-dollar exchange
rate. Our results show that the Korean ﬁnancial market
is slightly unstable and less systematic than other ﬁnan-
cial markets, though the results may be related to actual
transactions of all assets. In addition, by using the AR,
probit, and logit models, we deduce that the forecasted
(or simulated) sign is equal to the sign of the actual re-
turns. This deduction enables us to obtain the correct
match ratio. Moreover, because the match ratio is al-
ways greater than 0.5, we can conclude that our model
has an improved forecasting capability. The AR model,
which is expected to have a higher predictable value only
in the Korean ﬁnancial market, robustly supports the fu-
ture predictability of price movement trends in ﬁnancial
markets. We also note that, with nonlinear models of
data analysis, international ﬁnance theories can oﬀer an
enhanced interpretation of results. For the past decade,
many econophysical investigations have led to greater ap-
preciation of, and insight into, scale invariance and the
universality of statistical approaches to physics and eco-
nomics. Our results should encourage interdisciplinary
research of physics and economics.

We generalize the degree-organizational view [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] of real-world networks with broad
degree-distributions [6, 7, 8, 9] in a landscape analogue with mountains (high-degree nodes) and
valleys (low-degree nodes). For example, correlated degrees between adjacent nodes corresponds
to smooth landscapes (social networks) [1], hierarchical networks to one-mountain landscapes (the
Internet) [5], and degree-disassortative networks without hierarchical features to rough landscapes
with several mountains [2, 5, 10, 11]. We also generate ridge landscapes to model networks organized
under constraints imposed by the space the networks are embedded in, associated to spatial or, in
molecular networks, to functional localization. To quantify the topology, we here measure the widths
of the mountains and the separation between diﬀerent mountains.

The broad degree-distribution in many real-world net-
works makes it meaningfull to investigate the topological
organization of nodes in terms of their degree. It has been
found that many social networks are assortative, with
correlated degrees of adjacent nodes, but that technolog-
ical and biological networks often are disassortative, with
anticorrelated degrees of adjacent nodes [1, 3, 10, 11].
The degree correlation-proﬁle, generated by comparison
between the network and its randomized counterparts
without degree correlations, uncovers in the Internet an
overrepresentation of links between intermediate- and
low-degree nodes and a slight overrepresentation of links
between the nodes of highest degrees [4]. Contrary, most
biological networks have an underrepresentation of links
between the hubs [3]. To characterize the organization
beyond correlations between adjacent nodes, Trusina et
al. [5] introduced the hierarchy measure F . F ∈]0, 1], is
the fraction of shortest paths between all pairs of nodes
that are degree hierarchical [12]. The degrees of the nodes
along a degree-hierarchical shortest path are organized in
strictly ascending, strictly descending, or ﬁrst strictly as-
cending and then strictly descending order. It was found
that biological networks with decentralized hubs stand
out from other networks with a very low value of F [5].
Here we generalize the presented ﬁndings in a land-
scape analogue, with mountains (high degree nodes) and
valleys (low degree nodes). With this interpretation, so-
cial networks form smooth landscapes, the Internet one
single mountain with ﬁrst ascending and then descend-
ing hierarchical paths, whereas biological networks form
rough landscapes with several mountains and broken hi-
erarchical paths. To quantify the topology and make it
possible to compare diﬀerent networks, we in this paper
measure the typical width of individual mountains and
the separation between diﬀerent mountains (Fig. 1).

To complement the methods to generate random net-
works (random one-mountain landscapes) [3, 4] and com-
pletely hierarchical networks (peaked one-mountain land-

FIG. 1: A network as a degree landscape with mountains and

hierarchical path ((a) to (b)) while climbing over more than
one mountain breaks the degree-hierarchical path ((a) to (c)).

scapes) [5] with preserved degree-sequences, we here sug-
gest a method to generate ridge landscapes (Fig. 2). In
its simplest implementation, we assign a random rank
to every node in a network, and organize the nodes hi-
erarchically based on their rank. This method creates
non-random networks, distinguished by a separation of
hubs (disassortative with low F ). We argue that the
ridge landscapes can represent networks organized under
diﬀerent spatial constraints put on real-world networks
during their evolution.

We start by reviewing the method presented by
Trusina et al. [5] to generate degree-hierarchical net-
works, here denoted degree-rank hierarchies. In the same
time, we in detail present the suggested method to gener-
ate ridge landscapes (or random-rank hierarchies). The
networks evolve by pair-wise rewirings of the links, with
every rewiring constrained by the rank of the nodes in-
volved in the rewiring. The rank of a node is propor-
tional to its degree in the degree-rank hierarchy, and set
to a random rank (degree independent) in the random-
rank hierarchy. At every time step, two random links are
chosen, and reconnected such that the two nodes with
the highest ranks become adjacent (see Fig. 2(a-b)). In

FIG. 2: Networks as degree landscapes organized from ridge landscapes (c), via random landscapes (e), to peaked one-mountain
landscapes (g). The links are pairwise swapped to connect high-ranked nodes to organize the nodes globally according to their
rank (color coded from red for high rank, to white for low rank), with random swaps at diﬀerent rates ε. The rank is set
randomly to the nodes, as in the swap example in (a), in (c-d), and proportional to the degree of the nodes, as in the swap
example in (b), in (f-g). The random network in (e) corresponds to ε = 1. The corresponding degree landscapes are color
coded according to altitude from black (low) to white (high). The networks are scale-free with an exponent γ = 2.5 and of size
N=400, originally generated with the algorithm suggested [5]. The layout is generated with the Kamada-Kawai algorithm in
Pajek [13].

this way the degree of every node is kept constant and
the nodes are globally organized in decreasing rank-order.
To be able to investigate networks between the random-
rank hierarchical networks respectively the degree-rank
hierarchical networks, and random networks, we allow
for random link-swaps without the constraints set by the
rank of the nodes. A probability ε to make a random
link-swap corresponds in this way to an error rate in the
creation of the extreme networks. When ε → 1 the meth-
ods become equivalent to the randomization of networks
with remained degree-sequence suggested in [3], see Fig.
2(e).

Figure 2 shows topologies generated with the diﬀer-
ent models. They all originate from a random scale-free
network (shown in Fig. 2(e)) with degree distribution,
P (k) ∝ k−2.5 and system size N = 400, generated with
the method suggested in [5]. The extreme networks, the
perfect random-rank hierarchy in Fig. 2(c) and the per-
fect degree-rank hierarchy Fig. 2(g) (ε = 0), surround
the networks with increasing error-rate towards the ran-
dom scale-free network with ε = 1 in the middle (Fig.
2(e)). The perfect degree-rank hierarchy consists of a
tightly connected core of large degree nodes, that forms
a very peaked mountain. The landscape is not too far
from the, although ﬂatter, random case. The random-
rank hierarchy, on the other hand, forms a very stringy
and non-random structure — a ridge landscape. The
length of the string is of the order D ∝ N , with very
long pathways that break the small-world property found
in most real-world networks. However, as for the original
small-world scenario proposed by [14], the large diameter
of the stringy scale-free networks collapses if small per-

turbations exist in the hierarchical organization. If we
generate the network with a small error rate ε, the diam-
eter of the network collapses as seen in Fig. 2(d). Note
that the color gradient indicates that the random-rank
hierarchy is still intact at this stage, and that the hubs
(mountains) are separated. The degree-rank hierarchy in
Fig. 2(f) is rewired with a higher error rate ε = 0.5, while
still maintaining a high level of hierarchical organization.
In both cases, the two organizing principles leads to
higher clustering [14], more triangles, than in the random
counterparts (not shown). This is expected, as organiza-
tion along any coordinate tends to make friends of friends
more alike. The eﬀect is stronger in the degree-rank hier-
archy, since the clustering automatically increases further
when the hubs with their many links are connected.

In Fig. 2, we also quantify the degree-hierarchical or-
ganizations of the scale-free networks organized by, re-
spectively, degree- and number rank. For the random
scale-free network with degree distribution P (k) ∝ k−2.5
and N = 1000 nodes, F = 0.83 ± 0.05. The networks
organized hierarchically according to degree-rank (as in
Fig. 2(b)) have F = 1 as expected. Further, when in-
troducing a ﬁnite error rate ε for link rewirings toward
the degree-hierarchy we ﬁnd that its topology is robust
in the sense that both diameter (not shown) and F re-
main unchanged for even quite large errors. The perfect
random-rank hierarchy has a much lower degree hierar-
chical organization, F = 0.13 ± 0.05. Because of the
collapsing diameter, the random-rank hierarchy is not
as robust as the degree-rank hierarchy to errors in the
rewiring.

a number of real-world networks as degree landscapes:
Yeast in (a) is the protein-interaction network in Sac-
charomyces Cerevisia detected by the two-hybrid exper-
iment [15], Manhattan in (b) is the dual map of Manhat-
tan with streets as nodes and intersections as links [16],
and the Internet in (c) is the network of autonomous sys-
tems [17]. Internet and Manhattan consist of one single
mountain with ﬁrst ascending and then descending hi-
erarchical paths, whereas yeast forms a rough landscape
with several mountains and broken hierarchical paths.

To quantify the degree landscapes independently of the
layout dimension, we introduce two measures. First, in-
spired by the information horizons in networks [18, 19,
20], we present a revised hierarchy-measure F (ℓ), to es-
timate the size of the mountains. F (ℓ) is the fraction of
pairs of nodes at distance ℓ that are hierarchically con-
nected. Figure 4(a) shows that F (ℓ) decreases fastest for
the random-rank hierarchy at a length scale ℓ ≈ 4 cor-
responding to the width of the ridge landscape shown in
Fig. 2(c). Figure 4(b-d) shows the real-world networks
as in Fig. 3 compared with their random counterparts
with the same degree sequence [3]. Yeast behaves qual-
itatively like the random-rank hierarchy with ε between
0 and 0.1, which probably reﬂects some functional local-
ization. Contrary, despite their embedding in real space,
the Internet and Manhattan both have a substantial frac-
tion of long degree-hierarchical paths, corresponding to

FIG. 4: The degree-hierarchical organization as a function of
path length. F(ℓ) is the fraction of pair of nodes, separated by
a distance ℓ, that are connected by a degree-hierarchical path.

(Degree-Rank), the random-rank hierarchy (Random-Rank)
for ε = 0 and 0.1, together with the random scale-free network

as in Fig. 3. All networks are compared with their random
counterparts (Rand) [3].

wide mountains. However, the randomized counterparts
of the two latter networks, with more peaked mountain
landscapes, are both more degree hierarchical than the
real networks.

We deﬁne the width of a mountain as the length where
50 procent of the paths are hierarchical. Figure 4 shows
that the average width of the mountains in the random-
rank hierarchy and yeast is about 4. In Manhattan and
the Internet it is larger, about 6, and in the degree-rank
hierarchy it is by deﬁnition the network diameter.

In the second landscape measure, we measure the sep-
aration between mountains to investigate how the hubs
are positioned relative to each other. d(khub) is associ-
ated to maximum distances between nodes with degree k
equal or larger to the threshold value khub. It is deﬁned
by the distance from one hub to its most distant hub in
the network, averaged over all hubs

with dij being the length of the shortest path between i
and j, and ki the degree of node i. The value of d(khub)
is highly dependent of the deﬁnition of a hub, and we
therefore measure d(khub) for all values of khub.

FIG. 5: Average longest distance d(khub) between nodes of
degree k > khub as a function of khub (Eq. 1), for the same
networks as in Fig. 4.

Figure 5 shows d(khub) for a few diﬀerent networks and
their random counterparts. Figure 5(a) shows that the
one-mountain landscapes, the degree-rank hierarchy and
the random network, both have hubs tightly connected.
Contrary, the hubs in the random-rank hierarchy are ex-
tremely separated (d(1) ≈ 100) all the way out to a very
high hub-threshold value. All the real-world networks
in Fig. 5(b-d) fall in between these extremes, but with
a higher d(khub) than randomly expected for most val-
ues of khub. Manhattan, (Fig. 5(c)), and the Internet,
(Fig. 5(d)), are close to random for really high degrees,
while yeast, (Fig. 5(b)), has a separation for all sizes.
The close resemblance between the random-rank hierar-
chy and yeast in Fig. 4 and 5 suggests that the separation
of hubs probably reﬂects a separation of function at all
scales.

Manhattan is mainly a planned city where the largest
hubs, corresponding to streets and avenues, are con-
nected to each other in a bipartite way. This results
in a d(khub) close to 2 for the largest hubs. The Internet
is constructed with a hierarchical structure within each
country, and all intermediate-degree nodes (typically con-
nected to low degree nodes [4]) are therefore separated
from each other globally. However, the largest hubs inter-
connect the countries, and are therefore connected with
each other. This results in a d(khub) close to 1 for the
largest hubs.

To summarize, we have generalized the degree-
organizational view of real-world networks with broad
degree-distributions, in a landscape analogue with moun-
tains (high degree nodes) and valleys (low degree nodes).

To quantify the topology and to be able to compare net-
works, we have measured the widths of the mountains
and the separation between diﬀerent mountains. We
found that the dual map of Manhattan consists approx-
imately only of one mountain. This implies that typical
navigation between a source and a target in the city in-
volves ﬁrst going to larger and larger streets, and then
to smaller and smaller streets. The Internet shares this
one-mountain landscape, but the spatial constraints are
weaker and the width of the mountain is about the same
despite the substantially larger network.

Finally,

the topological

landscape in the protein-
interaction network in yeast has a topology with numer-
ous separated hills. We suggest that this reﬂect func-
tional localization, where proteins tend to be connected
because of similar functions rather than because they
have similar degree.

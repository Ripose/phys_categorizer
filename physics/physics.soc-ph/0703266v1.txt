Abstract. The Majority Rule is applied to a topology that consists of two coupled
random networks, thereby mimicking the modular structure observed in social
networks. We calculate analytically the asymptotic behaviour of the model and derive a
phase diagram that depends on the frequency of random opinion ﬂips and on the inter-
connectivity between the two communities. It is shown that three regimes may take
place: a disordered regime, where no collective phenomena takes place; a symmetric
regime, where the nodes in both communities reach the same average opinion; an
asymmetric regime, where the nodes in each community reach an opposite average
opinion. The transition from the asymmetric regime to the symmetric regime is shown
to be discontinuous.

1. Introduction

In the last few years, the study of networks has received an enormous amount of attention
from the scientiﬁc community [1, 2], in disciplines as diverse as computer and information
sciences (the Internet and the World Wide Web), sociology and epidemiology (networks
of personal or social contacts), biology (metabolic and protein interaction), etc. This
outburst of interest has been driven mainly by the possibility to use networks in order
to represent many complex systems and by the availability of communication networks
and computers that allow us to gather and analyze data on a scale far larger than
previously possible. The resulting change of scale (from a few dozen of nodes in
earlier works to several thousands of nodes today) has not only lead to the deﬁnition
of new statistical quantities in order to describe large networks, e.g. degree distribution
or clustering coeﬃcient, but it has also addressed problems pertaining to Statistical
Physics, for instance by looking at the interplay between the microscopic interactions
of neighbouring nodes and the behaviour of the system at a macroscopic level. Such
a problem takes place in social networks, i.e. nodes represent individuals and links
between nodes represent their relations (e.g. friendship, co-authorship), when one tries
to ﬁnd macroscopic equations for the evolution of ”society”. Indeed, many studies have
revealed non-trivial structures in social networks, such as fat-tailed degree distributions
[3], a high clustering coeﬃcient [4] and the presence of communities [5]. A primordial
problem is therefore to understand how this underlying topology inﬂuences the way
the interactions between individuals (physical contact, discussions) may (or not) lead
to collective phenomena. Typical examples would be the propagation of a virus [6] or
opinion [7, 8] in a social network, that may lead to the outbreak of an epidemics or of
a new trend/fashion.

It is now well-known that degree heterogeneity [6, 9] is an important factor that
may radically alter the macroscopic behaviour of a network but, surprisingly, the role
played by its modular structure is still poorly known [10, 11]. It has been observed,
though, that many social networks exhibit modular structures [5, 12, 13], i.e.
they
are composed of highly connected communities, while nodes in diﬀerent communities
are sparsely connected. This lack of interaction between communities certainly has
consequences on the way information diﬀuses through the network, for instance, but it
also suggests that nodes belonging to diﬀerent communities may behave in a radically
diﬀerent way.

In this paper, we address such a problem by focusing on a simple model for networks
with two communities, the Coupled Random Networks (CRN). To do so, one consider a
set of N nodes that one divides into two classes and one randomly assigns links between
the nodes. Moreover, one assumes that the probability for two nodes to be linked is
larger when they belong to the same class. Let us stress that CRN has been ﬁrst
introduced in [5] and that it is particularly suitable in order to highlight the role of the
network modularity while preserving its randomness. The microscopic dynamics that
we apply on CRN is the well-known Majority Rule (MR) [14]. MR is a very general

model for opinion-formation, i.e. nodes copy the behaviour of their neighbour, thereby
suggesting that the results derived in this paper should also apply to other models of
the same family. The eﬀect of the inter-connectivity ν and of the frequency of random
ﬂips, measured by the parameter q (
temperature) on the phase diagram is studied
analytically. It is shown that three regimes may take place, depending on the parameters
and on the initial conditions: a disordered regime, where no collective phenomena takes
place; a symmetric regime, where the nodes in both communities reach the same average
opinion; an asymmetric regime, where the nodes in each community reach an opposite
average opinion. The transition from the asymmetric regime to the symmetric regime
is shown to be discontinuous.
It is remarkable to note that a similar discontinuous
transition also takes place when one applies MR to another network with communities,
namely the Coupled Fully-Connected Networks introduced in [10]. The main advantage
of CRN is that its simpler structure allows to perform all the calculations exactly and
to consider the case of a non-vanishing q in detail.

2. Majority Rule

The network is composed of N nodes, each of them endowed with an opinion that can be
either α or β. At each time step, one of the nodes is randomly selected and two processes
may take place. With probability q, the selected node randomly picks an opinion α or β,
q,
whatever its previous opinion or the opinion of its neighbours. With probability 1
two neighbouring nodes of the selected node are also selected and the three agents in
this majority triplet all adopt the state of the local majority (see Fig.1). The parameter
q therefore measures the competition between individual choices, that have a tendency
to randomize the opinions in the system, and neighbouring interactions, that tend to
homogenize the opinion of agents. In the case q = 0, it is well-known that the system
asymptotically reaches global consensus where all nodes share the same opinion [14]. In
the other limiting case q = 1, the system is purely random and the average (over the
realizations of the random process) number of nodes with opinion α at time t, denoted
by At, goes to N/2.

−

Let us ﬁrst focus on a network of individuals that are highly connected (in order to
justify the use of mean-ﬁeld methods) and where all the nodes are equivalent. That case
has been studied in detail elsewhere [15], and is repeated here for the sake of clarity and
introducing notations. It is straightforward to show that the mean-ﬁeld rate equation
for At reads

where at = At/N is the average proportion of nodes with opinion α. The term
proportional to q accounts for the individual random ﬂips. The second term, accounting
for majority processes, is evaluated by calculating the probability that the majority
triplet is composed of two nodes α and one node β, 3a2

It is easy to show that a = 1/2 is always a stationary solution of Eq.(1), as expected
from symmetry reasons. a = 1/2 corresponds to a disordered state where no collective
opinion has emerged in the system. It is useful to rewrite the evolution equation for the

3. Role of communities

3.1. Coupled Random Networks

Distinct communities within networks are deﬁned as subsets of nodes which are more
densely linked when compared to the rest of the network. For the sake of simplicity,
we restrict the scope to networks composed of only two communities, denoted by 1 and
2. Our goal is to build an uncorrelated random network where nodes in 1 are more

likely to be connected with nodes in 1 than with nodes in 2, and vice-versa. To do
so, we consider a set of N nodes that we divide nodes into two classes, 1 and 2. We
evaluate each pair of nodes in the system and draw a link between these nodes with
probability pij, where i and j
are the class to which the two nodes belong. In
the following, we consider a case where the number of nodes in 1 and 2, respectively
denoted by N1 and N2, are equal N1 = N2 = N/2. Moreover, we restrict the scope
to the following probabilities p12 = p21 = pcross and p11 = p22 = pin. By construction,
pinN/2 nodes in
nodes in 1 are therefore connected on average to kin = pin(N
1 and to kcross = pcrossN/2 nodes in 2, while nodes in 2 are connected to kcross nodes in
1 and kin nodes in 2. Let us stress that this approach pertains to the theory of networks
with hidden variables [17, 18] where the probability for a pair to be linked would not
= pipj. A similar model has already been used in order to test methods for

Before going further, one should also point to an alternative model of modular
networks introduced in [10].
In that paper, Coupled Fully Connected Networks are
composed of three kinds of nodes, the interface nodes, the nodes of type 1 and the
nodes of type 2, and an inter-connectivity parameter measures the modularity of the
network. MR has been applied on this topology with q = 0 and it has been shown that

a discontinuous transition from an asymmetric to a symmetric state takes place. In the
following, we will not only show that a similar discontinuous transition takes place on
CRN, but we will also study analytically the behaviour of the system for q

= 0

3.2. Equation of evolution

Let us denote by A1 and A2 the average number of nodes with opinion α among the
two types of nodes. Let us ﬁrst focus on the contributions when majority triplets are
selected. At each time step, the probability that the selected node belongs to the ﬁrst
community is 1/2. In that case, the probability that a randomly chosen link around
the selected node goes to a node in 1 is kin/(kin + kcross) = 1/(1 + ν). The probability
that this randomly chosen link goes to a node in 2 is kcross/(kin + kcross) = ν/(1 + ν).
Consequently, the probability that the selected node belongs to 1 and that both of its
selected neighbours belong to 2 is

Similarly, the probability that the selected node belongs to 1, that one of its neighbours
belongs to 1 and that the other neighbour belongs to 2 is

Direct calculations show that Eq.(10) reduces to Eq.(1) in the limit ν = 1, as expected
due to the indistinguishability of the nodes in that case.

3.3. Stability of the disordered solution

It is straightforward to show that a1 = 1/2, a2 = 1/2 is always a stationary solution
of Eq.(10), whatever the values of ν and q. This solution consists of a disordered state
where both communities behave similarly and where no favourite opinion has emerged
due to MR. We study the stability of this disordered state by looking at small deviations
1/2 and keeping only linear corrections. In the continuous

read

By deﬁnition, the disordered solution is stable only when both eigenvalues are negative
[19], thereby ensuring that a small perturbation asymptotically vanishes. It is easy to
show that only the values of q in the interval ]3/5, 1] respect this condition, whatever
the value of ν. This implies that the location of the order-disorder transition is not
aﬀected by the modularity of the network. Let us also stress that that λ1 goes to λ2

3.4. Symmetric solution

Our knowledge of the case ν = 1 (section 2) and the natural symmetry of CRN suggests
to look at solutions of the form a1 = 1/2 + δS, a2 = 1/2 + δS (S for symmetric). By

It is remarkable to note that the symmetric solution does not depend on the inter-
connectivity ν. This is checked by comparing (16) with the solution (4) obtained when
the system is composed of only one community. It is also straightforward to show that
(16) is stable when q < 3/5, as expected, from which one concludes that none of the
characteristics of the order-disorder transition have been altered by the modularity of
the network.

3.5. Asymmetric solution

Let us ﬁrst focus on the case q = 0 where the dynamics is only driven by MR. We have
shown above that the system may reach a symmetric frozen state a1 = 1, a2 = 1 or
a1 = 0, a2 = 0 in that case (see Eq.(16)). However, computer simulations (Fig.3a) show
that an asymmetric stationary state may prevail for small enough values of ν. Computer
simulations also show that the asymmetric state is characterized by averages of the form
a1 = 1/2 + δA and a2 = 1/2
δA (A for asymmetric). Based on these numerical results,
we look for stationary solutions of Eq.(9) having this form. It is straightforward to show
that the equations for A1 and A2 lead to the following condition

Consequently, the system exhibits a discontinuous transition at νc, as 1/2 + δA(νc)

= 1. When ν < νc, the system may reach either the symmetric or the asymmetric
solution depending on the initial conditions (and on the ﬂuctuations). When ν > νc, in
contrast, only the symmetric solution is attained in the long time limit. Let us stress that
MR also undergoes a discontinuous transition from an asymmetric state to a symmetric
state when it is applied to Coupled Fully Connected Networks [10]. This similarity
suggests therefore that such a transition is a generic feature of networks with modular
structure. The above theoretical results have been veriﬁed by performing computer
simulations of MR. The asymmetric solution (18) and the location of the transition (20)
are in perfect agreement with the simulations (Fig.3b).

It is straightforward to generalize these results when q > 0. To do so, one inserts

increase of the number of inter-community links (along ν) or to an increase of the
internal ﬂuctuations (along q).

This relation therefore determines the critical line above which only symmetric solutions
prevail (see Fig.4). One can shown that (25) decreases with q and that it goes to zero
at the transition point q = 3/5. It is also easy to show that the transition from the
asymmetric to symmetric state is discontinuous for any values of q < 3/5. Eq. (22)
and Eq. (25) have been successfully checked by computer simulations (see Fig.3c and
Fig.3d).

4. Discussions

In this last section, we would like to point to some possible applications of this work and
to the implications of our theoretical predictions. First of all, let us remind that many
networks exhibit modular structures. It is therefore of signiﬁcant practical importance
to better understand the role played by these structures. This is true for social networks,
where groups of nodes correspond to social communities or cliques, but also for the World

Coexistence of opposite opinions in a network with communities.

Wide Web, where groups of highly connected sites may be related by a common topic
[22, 23], biological networks, where clusters of nodes may be associated to functional
modules [24, 25, 26], GDP networks, from which dependencies between countries might
be uncovered [27, 28] and even self-citation networks where clusters may reveal the
ﬁeld mobility of a scientist [29]. The identiﬁcation of such communities is thus a
very important problem, that has received a considerable amount of attention recently
[30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37]. Amongst others investigations, it has been shown that
the use of Ising-like models may be helpful in order to unravel communities in complex
networks [38, 39]. This approach consists in applying a dynamics such as the majority
rule on a pre-given network and to identify a community as a set of nodes having the
same opinion/spin. In the language of this paper, the identiﬁcation of the communities
if both communities
is possible only if the system reaches an asymmetric regime, i.e.
reach diﬀerent states. Our work could therefore provide a theoretical background for
the use of such identiﬁcation techniques. For instance, our results show that MR has
a ”minimum resolution”, i.e. MR does not discriminate communities when ν > νc(q)
(with νc(q) < (√48
6)/6) because the asymmetric state is not stable in that case. One
expects that similar eﬀects could also take place for similar models of opinion formation.
The fact that nodes in diﬀerent communities exhibit diﬀerent behaviours, i.e. the
asymmetric regime, has been observed in many situations. Amongst others, one may
think of subcommunities in collaboration networks, that may correspond roughly to
topics of research [5], the Political Blogosphere, where it was observed that bloggers
having a diﬀerent political opinion are segregated [40], the existence of niche markets
[41], where small communities may use products that are diﬀerent from those used by
the majority, language dynamics, where it is well-known that natural frontiers may
also coincide with a linguistic frontier [42], etc. The discontinuity of the transition
from this asymmetric state to a symmetric ”globalized” state might thus have radical
consequences for systems close to the transition line: the addition of a few links between
the communities or a small increase of the ﬂuctuations inside the system (see Fig.4) may
be suﬃcient in order to drive the system out of the asymmetric state. Such rapid shifts
of behaviour of a whole sub-community should be searched in empirical data, in the
dynamics of trends or fashion [43] for instance.

To conclude, we would like to point to a possible generalization that would certainly
make the model more realistic. In this paper, we have focused on a model of opinion
formation evolving on a static topology. The eﬀect of the network structure on the
formation of a collective opinion has therefore been highlighted, but the fact that
the opinion of the nodes themselves might inﬂuence the topology around them, e.g.
links between nodes with diﬀerent opinions could disappear, has not been considered.
A model where the network inter-connectivity ν might co-evolve [44] with the node
spins/opinions would thus be of high interest and will be considered in a future work.
Other interesting generalizations would incorporate agents with ageing [45, 46, 47] or
memory [48], the presence of leaders [49], etc.

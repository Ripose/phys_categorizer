Abstract

With a new deprivation (or poverty) function, in this paper, we theoretically study
the changes in poverty with respect to the ‘global’ mean and variance of the income
distribution using Indian survey data. We show that when the income obeys a log-
normal distribution, a rising mean income generally indicates a reduction in poverty
while an increase in the variance of the income distribution increases poverty. This
altruistic view for a developing economy, however, is not tenable anymore once the
poverty index is found to follow a pareto distribution. Here although a rising mean
income indicates a reduction in poverty, due to the presence of an inﬂexion point in
the poverty function, there is a critical value of the variance below which poverty de-
creases with increasing variance while beyond this value, poverty undergoes a steep
increase followed by a decrease with respect to higher variance. Following these
results, we make quantitative predictions to correlate a developing with a developed
economy.

1 Introduction

Since the paradigmatic contribution of Sen [15, 17] and Atkinson [1], a remarkable amount
of eﬀort has been undertaken [7, 9] in theoretically understanding the economics of poverty
and inequality. The studies range from being aptly mathematical in nature to a qualita-
tive characterisation of such population dialectics. Pradhan and Ravallion [13] have used
qualitative assessments of perceived consumption adequacy based on a household survey.
They claim that perceived consumption needs can be a more promising approach than
the subjective income-based poverty line. This consumption norm can correspond to a
saturation level of consumption, below which the individual could be considered to be in
poverty. Further, in this paper, our approach is rather complementary to a lemma-based
mathematical model in that we use survey based consumption data to quantify the de-
pendence of a well-known poverty function [6, 8] on the mean and variance of the income
distribution. To this end, we use income-expenditure data from a ‘developing nation’
(India in our case) and utilise the well established technique of data ﬁtting to deﬁne the
per capita consumption as a function of income. Here the implicit assumption is that
of a near equilibrium situation such that the time dependence of both income and con-
sumption variables can be considered as transients without much eﬀect on the asymptotic
distributions. Deaton [5] has discussed the ambiguity that arises using survey data versus
national accounts data for individual consumption or income levels. Although the survey
consumption data seem to understate the true consumption levels, we are however using
the data as a backup to our analytical results thereby restricting our claims to being
qualitative in nature. Such comparisons with real data help us have approximate ideas of
the values of the unknown parameters, two in our model, although the general conclusions
are remarkably independent of these parameter values.

Assuming that the income distribution can be characterised by a two-parameter function,
such as a log-normal distribution, in the ﬁrst section of the paper we study the eﬀects
of changes in the mean and variance of the underlying income distribution on poverty.
The results of this analysis indicate that an increase in mean income and a reduction in
the variance of income distribution can reduce poverty. It also hints towards a trade-oﬀ,
in that while an increase in average income reduces poverty, a simultaneous increase in
income variance can escalate poverty. This result is likely to suggest that reducing income
inequality should be the precondition for lowering poverty. These general results are then
contrasted in the following section using a diﬀerent model for the income distribution,
the pareto distribution. The objective is basically to probe whether the results obtained
are universal in nature and if not, then which distribution deﬁnes a better measure of
poverty. 1

1Sen (1976) introduced the notion of deprivation in the income distribution literature, and criticised
the use of the head-count ratio as a measure of poverty. Rao (1981) suggested broadening the scope
of poverty measurement to nutritional norms as opposed to monetary measures.
If poverty is to be
regarded as negative welfare, it makes sense to relate it to consumption deprivation resulting from an
uneven income distribution rather than to the income distribution alone as is done by the traditional

2

2 Poverty impact of changes in log-normal income

distribution

Poverty equals consumption deprivation on an essential food. The necessity of deﬁning
poverty as a multidimensional concept rather than relying on income or consumption
expenditures per capita has been well documented. Although it is important to assess
deprivation with more than one attribute (see [2, 3, 6, 12]), we consider the case of most
essential food item that is required for survival, in an attempt to include deprivation into
the poverty index. Such an index would suggest that a person can be considered poor if
the individual’s consumption falls within the deprivation area in the diagram (see lower
panel of Fig.1), that is, the cumulative diﬀerence between the saturation consumption
level of cereal and actual cereal consumption by the community as a whole. The upper
panel of Fig.1 shows positive consumption even at zero income level, which makes our
[10]. The
formulation more realistic than the non-linear function used in Kumar et al.
non-linear function used in our paper that allows a saturation level of consumption norm
for food-grains is as follows:

where C is the consumption expenditure on food-grains, y is income and the parameters
V, K(> 0) represent the saturation level of real food-grain consumption expenditure or
the bliss level and the level of income needed to consume one half of the saturation level
respectively. Consumption deprivation (CD) or poverty (P) can be deﬁned as the shortfall
of actual consumption expenditure relative to saturation level V, or CD = V
C. Thus
the non-linear CD function is derived as:

−

C(y) =

V exp(y)
K + exp(y)

CD =

V K
K + exp(y)

(1)

(2)

→

This function, being a convex decreasing function of income provides a direct measure of
poverty based on nutritional norms, while V and K are parameters of a concave Engel
V represents the idealistic limit where there is no deprivation or poverty
curve. Here C
corresponding to a static equilibrium in the social dialectics mathematically represented
by y = y∗. In what follows, we would consider two asymptotic regimes - y
→ ∞
- physically which correspond to the low and high income groups respectively. Naturally
our focus would be on the y
0 limit, that is on the low income section although the
analysis would encompass both limits.
If consumption of the most essential food item follows a concave non-linear functional
form and if individual poverty is measured as the diﬀerence between the saturation level
of consumption of the essential food item and its actual level, assumption of a log-normal
income distribution implies a reduction in poverty with the increase of mean income of
the population and an increase in inequality with increasing poverty. This new measure

2.1 Asymptotic solutions of the poverty function

This section deals with asymptotic solutions of the poverty functions for extremely low
(y
0) to moderate values of the income distribution. This is mathematically categorised
in the following manner:

→

For moderate incomes, C(y) = V exp(y)

K+exp(y) = Cmod(y), say,

1. Cmod(y
2. Cmod(y
whereas for very low income groups, C(y) = V y

) = V

K+1 &

K+y = C low(y), say,

1. Clow(y
2. Clow(y

0) = 0 &
) = V

→
→ ∞

→

The above comparison clearly shows that although both deﬁnitions of the consumption
function are generally equivalent in the low income limit, for the absolutely needy groups,
Cmod(y) predicts a non-zero ( V
K+1) lower limit of income which is more realistic than
0) = 0. A linear stability analysis of Clow(y) also shows that y = 0 is an
Clow(y
unstable ﬁxed point, which further strengthens this conviction. Henceforth our attention
will mainly be focused towards the lowest income groups deﬁned by Clow(y), although we
would ﬂip back and forth between the moderate to the low income classes for compar-
isons. Before proceeding any further, though, we ﬁrst derive the values of the parameters
V, K by ﬁtting the function Cmod with actual survey data obtained from National Sample
Survey, 1999-2000, 55th Round, India. We would be using these values of V, K in all
analyses in this paper. Fig.2 portrays the shape of an Engle curve, graphing real cereal
expenditure against the total expenditure - a surrogate for income.

The above exact data ﬁtting conclusively shows that the parameters V and K have the
respective values 45 and 15 in Indian currency (Rupees). These are roughly equivalent
to 1.0 USD and 0.33 USD respectively. Now using these values, we study the case for
typically the lowest income classes deﬁned by the consumption function Clow(y). In this
case, however, we need to focus on both low and high limits of the variance. Upto ﬁrst
order in σ2, we ﬁnd that

Fig. 3 tells us that poverty is a monotonically decreasing function of variance for a ﬁxed
mean (taken to be 2.773 for a direct comparison with Fig. 4 later). On the other hand, for
a ﬁxed variance (0.001), poverty increases with mean and then saturates after a critical
value. This result is very remarkable but needs to be taken with a pinch of salt, especially
since this is true only in the asymptotic (σ
0) regime. We will revisit this problem in
→
the following section where we discuss the situation when both the mean and the variance

7

of the income distribution are simultaneously varying.

2.2 Overall impact of simultaneous changes in mean and vari-

ance

Here we show what eﬀect any change, either increase or decrease, in the income distri-
bution has on the overall poverty function when the distribution is log-normal and when
both mean and variance are varying. Since our focus is on the low income group, we will
be using Clow(y) as our deﬁnition for the consumption function. The attention here would
be to decipher the joint variation of the poverty function P (µ, σ2) with respect to µ and
σ2. Once again using a 1/y expansion 3 upto the ﬁrst order, we ﬁnd that the joint poverty
function reads as

dP (µ, σ2) =

(7)

This equation suggests that poverty is a decreasing function of changes in µ and an in-
creasing function of changes in σ2. For a ﬁxed variance, dσ2=0, and hence the ﬁrst
component of [7], reﬂecting change in µ, will provide convergence; and with a ﬁxed mean,
dµ=0, the second component, exhibiting change in σ2, will give convergence of the equa-
tion. When both the mean and variance of the income distribution change as a result of
changes in macroeconomic policies, their eﬀect on poverty can be evaluated via equation
(7). The notable point here is the fundamental qualitative diﬀerence with the prediction
from equation (6). As opposed to the earlier asymptotic result where increase of the mean
income was expected to generate a positive augmentation in poverty (for ﬁxed variance)
followed by a saturation at a particular value µc, equation (7) with a ﬁxed σ clearly sug-
gests that poverty decreases with increase of the mean income. This apparent dichotomy
can be understood once we analyse the physical meaning hidden in equation (6). It says
that in a relatively large group of low earning population, a very small variance between
the earners contributes to an increase in poverty for very low to moderate values of the
mean income. However, once the mean income reaches a critical value, this spurious eﬀect
saturates oﬀ. This can be contrasted with the prediction from the last equation which
holds true for moderate to large values of σ. We would like to speciﬁcally point out here
that both predictions from equations (6, 7) are true but in their respective regimes deﬁned
by small to large values of σ.

3This might sound confusing since we are discussing small income but in eﬀect, all that we are doing is
to use a well known 1/y expansion prevalent in statistical mechanics. It is generally valid for a considerable
range involving large to moderate values of the variable y. We have checked this result using Cmod and
the qualitative results remain altogether unaltered.

3 Poverty impact of changes in pareto income distri-

bution

In this section, our objective is to study the mean and variance dependence of the poverty
function, replacing the log-normal probability distribution, previously assumed, with a
pareto distribution and contrast the ﬁndings later. Once again we would conform to the
same consumption and deprivation functions (1,2) and try to understand the qualitative
changes in the poverty function of a growing economy with respect to changes in the mean
and variance of the overall income distribution.

We would now directly evaluate the poverty function in a more physical limit. Without
any loss of generality we choose the limit K
0 which is akin to the 1/y expansion we
did in deriving the poverty function for the log-normal distribution. We would shortly
see that in this case, this basic expansion allows us to have an ‘exact’ derivation of the
poverty function as opposed to its log-normal counterpart. Upto the ﬁrst order in 1/y

where a = 2 +
(13) 5 shows that it has a pair of inﬂexion points 6, out of which the physical pair is
at µ = 3.05139 & σ2 = 0.0692138. Solving around this inﬂexion point, we now come
across one of the most remarkable results of this article, the fact that poverty initially
decreases with increasing variance until it reaches a critical value σ2 = σc
2 beyond which
the poverty starts increasing with variance followed by a dip once again.
Fig. 4 has been drawn using σ2 = 2.773, a value reasonably close to the inﬂexion point.
0.25 after which
The plot shows that poverty decreases until it reaches the point µc ∼
it starts increasing approximately until σ2 = 2 and then it starts decreasing again. This
result is in marked contrast with the log-normal case where the poverty rather uninterest-
ingly decreases with increasing mean for a ﬁxed variance, and increases with for a ﬁxed
mean. It is now not diﬃcult to pinpoint the detailed meaning of this result. Referring to
Fig. 4, zone A deﬁnes a rather ‘underdeveloped’ economy, zone B stands for a ‘develop-
ing’ economy, our case in study, while the ﬁnal zone C clearly indicates what one would
expect in the case of an economically ‘developed’ nation. We can probably claim without
much ambiguities that a pareto distribution has the power to encapsulate all three modes
of economies and is the ideal candidate for all future studies involving poverty measure.
Further, zones B and C appear to suggest an inverted-U hypothesis similar to Kuznets
[11] that poverty increases in the early stages of development and subsequently it declines
with higher level of economic progress even though such development is associated with
higher inequality.

5To evaluate the inﬂexion points, we used the software mathematica and later checked the result using
another software called maple. The results were once again cross-checked using a self-generated fortran
code. All numerical results that we cite in this article have been cross-checked using three diﬀerent and
independent numerical techniques.

solution gives a negative value of s. We work with the physical solution only.

4 Conclusion

This paper made use of a poverty function, which is diﬀerent from the conventional poverty
indices in the following manner: (1) the CD index does not depend on an arbitrarily cho-
sen poverty line, (2) it depends on the observed and measurable consumption behaviour
of people, (3) the index satisﬁes the standard axioms of a poverty index. Having used
such a consumption deprivation function as a measure of poverty, this paper has shown
analytically that for a log-normal income distribution, an increase in mean income, ceteris
paribus, will decrease poverty while an increase in the variance of the income distribution,
ceteris paribus, will increase poverty although somewhat contradictory information was
obtained for the limiting case of earners with extremely low variance in their income dis-
tribution. In this case, poverty was found to decrease with increasing variance for a ﬁxed
mean, while when plotted against the mean (Fig. 3), it was found to initially increase
and then saturate after a critical value of the mean which we could determine theoretically.

These observations were later contrasted with observations made from a pareto distribu-
tion. Here we found that for very low earning groups in a developing economy, poverty
initially decreases with increasing variance but beyond a critical value of the variance, it
starts increasing later to decrease again. In the process, this deﬁnes all three economies
characterised by individual parametric regimes. The conclusion that we derive from these
joint analyses is that the variance dependence of poverty is not unequivocally simplistic,

11

in that one distribution (log-normal) predicts an increase in poverty with increasing vari-
ance (although the limiting σ2
0 case was somewhat qualitatively identical to zone B
for the pareto distribution) while the other (pareto) shows the existence of an inﬂexion
point in the poverty function. This means that the poverty-variance graph in a pareto
distribution has a critical point, on one side (zone A) of which poverty decreases with
increasing variance, while on the other side it is just the reverse.

→

Our contribution here is to prove that a pareto distribution oﬀers the more realistic mea-
sure of poverty in a developing economy. This is because it condones the very realistic fact
that for very low income groups a slight increase in the variance only serves to decrease
poverty whereas for high earning groups, greater the variation in earning greater is the
probability of an escalation in poverty up to another critical point, beyond which poverty
declines with any further increase in variance of wealth distribution in a society. This
phase seems to reﬂect the case of a very developed economy, one which we identify as the
supra-economic behaviour. In macroeconomic sense, this phase suggests that close to an
equilibrium dynamics, higher inequality could contribute to higher savings and thereby
higher growth and reduced poverty. In a follow-up work [4], shortly to be communicated,
we have shown that in the non-stationary case, where both income and consumption are
functions of time, the consumption deprivation dynamics can be mapped to the paradig-
matic Burgers’ equation, 7 thereby bestowing us with the ability to make quantitative
predictions on the poverty of a developing economy as a function of income and time.

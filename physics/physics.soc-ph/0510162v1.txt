Recent theoretical and empirical studies have focused on the structural properties of complex re-
lational networks in social, biological and technological systems. Here we study the basic properties
of twenty 1-square-mile samples of street patterns of diﬀerent world cities. Samples are represented
by spatial (planar) graphs, i.e. valued graphs deﬁned by metric rather than topologic distance and
where street intersections are turned into nodes and streets into edges. We study the distribution of
nodes in the 2-dimensional plane. We then evaluate the local properties of the graphs by measuring
the meshedness coeﬃcient and counting short cycles ( of three, four and ﬁve edges), and the global
properties by measuring global eﬃciency and cost. As normalization graphs, we consider both mini-
mal spanning trees (MST) and greedy triangulations (GT) induced by the same spatial distribution
of nodes. The results indicate that most of the cities have evolved into networks as eﬃcienct as GT,
although their cost is closer to the one of a tree. An analysis based on relative eﬃciency and cost is
able to characterize diﬀerent classes of cities.

I.

INTRODUCTION

During the last decade, the growing availability of
large databases, the increasing computing powers, as well
as the development of reliable data analysis tools, have
constituted a better machinery to explore the topologi-
cal properties of several complex networks from the real
world [1, 2, 3, 4]. This has allowed to study a large va-
riety of systems as diverse as social, biological and tech-
nological. The main outcome of this activity has been to
reveal that, despite the inherent diﬀerences, most of the
real networks are characterized by the same topological
properties, as for instance relatively small characteris-
tic path lengths and high clustering coeﬃcients ( the so
called small-world property) [5], scale-free degree distri-
butions [6], degree correlations [7], and the presence of
motifs [8] and community structures [9]. All such fea-
tures make real networks radically diﬀerent from regular
lattices and random graphs, the standard topologies usu-
ally used in modeling and computer simulations. This
has led to a large attention towards the comprehension
of the evolution mechanisms that have shaped the topol-
ogy of a real network, and to the design of new models
retaining the most signiﬁcant properties observed empir-
ically.

Spatial networks are a special class of complex networks
whose nodes are embedded in a two or three-dimensional
Euclidean space and whose edges do not deﬁne relations
in an abstract space (such as in networks of acquain-
tances or collaborations between individuals), but are
real physical connections [4]. Typical examples include
neural networks [10],
information/communication net-
works [11, 12], electric power grids [13] and transporta-
tion systems ranging from river [14], to airport [15, 16]
and street [17] networks. Most of the works in the liter-
ature, with a few relevant exceptions [11, 18, 19], have
focused on the characterization of the topological prop-
erties of spatial networks, while the spatial aspect has

received less attention, when not neglected at all. How-
ever, it is not surprising that the topology of such sys-
tems is strongly constrained by their spatial embedding.
For instance, there is a cost to pay for the existence of
long-range connections in a spatial network, this having
important consequences on the possibility to observe a
small-world behavior. Moreover, the number of edges
that can be connected to a single node is often limited
by the scarce availability of physical space, this impos-
ing some constraints on the degree distributions. In few
words, spatial networks are diﬀerent from other complex
networks and as such they need to be studied in a diﬀer-
ent way.

In this paper we focus on a particular class of spa-
tial networks: networks of urban street patterns. We
consider a database of 1-square mile samples of diﬀer-
ent world cities and for each city we construct a spatial
graph by associating nodes to street intersections and
edges to streets. In this way, each of the nodes of the
graph is given a location in a 2-dimensional square, and
a real number, representing the length of the correspond-
ing street, is associated to each edge. By construction,
the resulting graphs are planar graphs, i.e. graphs form-
ing nodes whenever two edges cross. After a previous
work on the distribution of centrality measures [20], here
we present a comparative study of the basic properties of
spatial networks of diﬀerent city street patterns. In par-
ticular we evaluate the characteristics of the graphs both
at a global and at a local scale. The main problem with
spatial graphs is that, in most of the cases, the random
graph or the complete graph are no more a good way to
normalize the results. In fact, the common procedure in
relational (non-spatial) complex networks is to compare
the properties of the original graph derived from the real
system with those of some randomized versions of the
graph, i.e. of graphs with the same number of nodes
and links as the original one, but where the links are dis-
tributed at random. This is, for instance, the standard

way proposed by Watts and Strogatz in Ref. [5] to assess
whether a real system is a small world. One quantiﬁes the
structural properties of the original graph by computing
its characteristic path length L and clustering coeﬃcient
C, where L measures the typical separation between two
vertices in the graph (a global property), whereas C mea-
sures the cliquishness of a typical neighbourhood (a local
property). Then, the graph is a small-world if L assume
a value close to that obtained for the randomized version
of the graph, Lrand, while the value of C is much larger
than Crand. Similarly, in the eﬃciency-based formalism
proposed in Refs. [21, 22], a small-world network is de-
ﬁned as a system being extremely eﬃcient in exchang-
ing information both at a global and at a local scale.
Again, the values of global and local eﬃciency are com-
pared with those obtained for a randomized version of
the graph. A similar method is used in the counting of
short cycles or speciﬁc motifs in a graph representing a
real system [8]. The research of the motifs and cycles is
based on matching algorithms counting the total number
of occurrences of each motif and each cycle in the original
graph and in the randomized ones. Then, a motif or a
cycle is statistically signiﬁcant if it appears in the original
graph at a number much higher than in the randomized
In a planar graph, as those de-
versions of the graph.
scribing urban street patterns, the randomized version of
the graph is not signiﬁcative because it is almost surely
a non-planar graph due to the edge crossings induced by
the random rewiring of the edges. Moreover, because of
the presence of long-range links, a random graph corre-
sponds to an extremely costly street pattern conﬁgura-
tion, where the cost is deﬁned as the sum of street lengths
[22]. The alternative is to compare urban street patterns
with grid-like structures. Following Ref. [18], we shall
consider both minimum spanning trees and greedy tri-
angulations induced by the real distribution of nodes in
the square. Spanning trees are the planar graphs with
the minimum number of links in order to assure connect-
edness, while greedy triangulations are graphs with the
maximum number of links compatible with the planarity.
Spanning trees and greedy triangulations will serve as the
two extreme cases to normalize the structural measures
we are going to compute.

II. NETWORKS OF URBAN STREET
PATTERNS

The database we have studied consists of twenty 1-
square mile samples of diﬀerent world cities, selected
from the book by Allan Jacobs [23]. We have im-
ported the twenty maps into a GIS (Geographic Infor-
mation System) environment and constructed the cor-
respondent spatial graphs of street networks by using a
road-centerline-between-nodes format [24]. Namely, each
urban street pattern is trasformed into a undirected, val-
ued (weighted) graph G = (N , L), embedded in the 2-
In Fig. 1 we show the case
dimensional unit square.

for the city of Savannah:
in the upper-left panel we
report the original map, and in upper-right panel the
obtained graph. N is the set of N nodes representing
street intersections and characterized by their positions
{xi, yi}i=1,...,N in the square. L is the set of K links
representing streets. The links follow the footprints of
real streets and are associated a set of real positive num-
bers representing the street lengths, {lk}k=1,...,K. The
graph is then described by the adjacency N × N matrix
A, whose entry aij is equal to 1 when there is an edge
between i and j and 0 otherwise, and by a N × N matrix
L, whose entry lij is equal to the length of the street con-
necting node i and node j. In this way both the topology
and the geography (metric distances) of the system will
be taken into account. A list of the considered cities is
reported in table I, together with the basic properties of
the derived graphs. The considered cases exhibit strik-
ing diﬀerences in terms of cultural, social, economic, reli-
gious and geographic context. In particular, they can be
roughly divided into two large classes: 1) patterns grown
throughout a largely self-organized, ﬁne-grained histori-
cal process, out of the control of any central agency; 2)
patterns realized over a short period of time as the result
of a single plan, and usually exhibiting a regular grid-like,
structure. Ahmedabad, Cairo and Venice are the most
representative examples of self-organized patterns, while
Los Angeles, Richmond, and San Francisco are typical ex-
amples of mostly-planned patterns. We have selected two
diﬀerent parts of the city of Irvine, CA, (named Irvine 1
and Irvine 2) for two highly diverse kinds of urban fab-
rics: the ﬁrst is a sample of an industrial area showing
enormous blocks with few intersections while the second
is a typical residential early sixties “lollipop” low density
suburb based on a tree-like layout with a lot of dead-
end streets. The diﬀerences between cities are already
evident from the basic properties of the derived graphs.
In fact, the number of nodes N , the number of links K,
and the cost of the wiring, deﬁned as the sum of street
lenghts:

Cost = X

and measured in meters, assume widely diﬀerent values,
notwithstanding the fact we have considered the same
amount of land. Notice that Ahmedabad has 2870 street
intersections and 4387 streets in a surface of 1-square
mile, while Irvine has only 32 intersections and 37 streets.
Ahmedabad and Cairo are the cities with the largest cost,
while the cost is very small (less than 40000 meters) in
Barcelona, Brasilia, Irvine, Los Angeles, New Delhi, New
York, San Francisco, Washington and Walnut Creek. A
large diﬀerence is also present in the average edge (street)
length hli, that assumes the smallest values in cities as
Ahmedabad, Cairo and Venice, and the largest value in
San Francisco, Brasilia, Walnut Creek and Los Angeles.
In Ref. [20] we have studied the edges length distribution
P (l) for the two diﬀerent classes of cities, showing that
self-organized cities show single peak distributions, while

mostly planned cities exhibit a multimodal distribution,
due to their grid pattern. We now have gone deeper into
the characterization of the distributions of nodes (street
intersections) in the unit square: we have calculated the
fractal dimension of the distributions, by using the box
counting method [25]. In all the samples, except Irvine 1
that is too small to draw any conclusion, we have found
that the nodes are distributed on a fractal support with
a fractal dimension ranging from 1.7 to 2.0. This result
is similar to that obtained by Yook et al. for the spatial
distribution of the nodes of the Internet, considered both
at the level of routers and at the level of autonomous
systems [11].

A. Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) and Greedy
Triangulation (GT)

Planar graphs are those graphs forming vertices when-
ever two edges cross, whereas non-planar graphs can
have edge crossings that do not form vertices [26]. The
graphs representing urban street patterns are, by con-
struction, planar, and we will then compare their struc-
tural properties with those of minimally connected and
maximally connected planar graphs. In particular, fol-
lowing Buhl et al. [18], we consider the Minimum Span-
ning Tree (MST) and the Greedy Triangulation (GT) in-
duced by the distribution of nodes (representing street
intersections) in the square. The Minimum Spanning
Tree (MST) is the shortest tree which connects every
nodes into a single connected component. By deﬁnition

3

the MST is an acyclic graph that contains Kmin = N − 1
links. This is the minimum number of links in order to
have all the nodes belonging to a single connected com-
ponent [26]. At the other extreme, the maximum num-
ber of links, Kmax, that can be accomodated in a planar
graph with N nodes (without breaking the planarity) is
equal to Kmax = 3N − 6 [27]. The natural reference
graph should be then the Minimum Weight Triangula-
tion (MWT), which is the planar graph with the high-
est number of edges Kmax, and that minimize the total
length. Since no polynomial time algorithm is known
to compute the MWT, we thus consider the Greedy Tri-
angulation (GT), that is based on connecting couples of
nodes in ascending order of their distance provided that
no edge crossing is introduced [28]. The GT is easily com-
putable and leads to a maximal connected planar graph,
while minimizing as far as possible the total length of
edges considered.

To construct both the MST and the GT induced by
the spatial distribution of points (nodes) {xi, yi}i=1,...,N
in the unit square, we have ﬁrst sorted out all the couples
of nodes, representing all the possible edges of a com-
plete graph, by ascending order of their length. Notice
that the length of the edge connecting node i and node
j is here taken to be equal to the Euclidean distance
ij = p(xi − xj)2 + (yi − yj)2. Then, to compute the
dEucl
MST we have used the Kruskal algorithm [29, 30]. The
algorithm consists in browsing the ordered list, starting
from the shortest edge and progressing toward the longer
ones. Each edge of the list is added if and only if the
graph obtained after the edge insertion is still a forest or
it is a tree. A forest is a disconnected graph in which any
two elements are connected by at most one path, i.e., a
disconnected ensemble of trees. (In practice, one checks
whether the two end-nodes of the edge are belonging or
not to the same component). With this procedure, the
graph obtained after all the links of the ordered list are
considered is the MST. In fact, when the last link is in-
cluded in the graph, the forest reduces to a single tree.
Since in the Kruskal algorithm an edge producing a cross-
ing would also produce a cycle, following this procedure
prevents for creating edge crossings. To compute the GT
we have constructed a brute force algorithm based on
some particular characteristics of planar GT [28]. The
algorithm consists in browsing the ordered list of edges
in ascending order of length, and checking for each edge
whether adding it produces any intersections with any
other edge already added.

For each of the twenty cities we have constructed the
respective MST and GT. These two bounds make also
sense as regards as the possible evolution of a city: the
most primitive forms are close to trees, while more com-
plex forms involve the presence of cycles. We can then
compare the structural properties of the orginal graphs
representing the city with those of the two limiting cases
represented by MST and GT. As an example in Fig. 1 in
the bottom-left and in the bottom-right panel we report
respectively the MST and the GT obtained for the city

of Savannah.

impacts on crucial factors for urban life, such as pedes-
trian movement, wayﬁnding, land-uses or other cognitive
or behavioural matters. However, it is worth noting that,
for instance, 3-arms and 4-arms street junctions are ex-
pected to perform very diﬀerently in human orienteering
within an urban complex system due to the diﬀerences in
the angle widths involved in each turn [31, 32]. It is also
interesting to notice the signiﬁcative frequency of nodes
with degree 1 in cities as Irvine and Walnut Creek. Such
nodes correspond to the dead-end cul-de-sac streets typi-
cal of the suburban early Sixties “lollipop” layouts, which
in turn leads to highly debated topics in the current dis-
cussion about safety and liveability of modern street pat-
terns as opposite to more traditional ones [33, 34].

Many complex networks show the presence of a large
number of short cycles or speciﬁc motifs [1, 2, 4]. For in-
stance, the so called local clustering, also known as tran-
sitivity, is a typical property of acquaintance networks,
where two individuals with a common friend are likely to
know each other [9]. The degree of clustering is usually
quantiﬁed by the calculation of the clustering coeﬃcient
C, introduced in Ref. [5], that is a measure of the fraction
of triangles present in the network. Such a quantity is
not suited to characterize the local properties of a planar
graph, since by a simple counting of the number of tri-
angles present in the graph it is not possible to discrimi-
nate between diﬀerent topologies. For instance, there are
cases as diverse as trees, square-meshes and honey-comb
meshes, all having the same clustering coeﬃcient equal
to zero. Buhl et al. have proposed a more general mea-
sure of the structure of cycles (not restricted to cycles of
length 3) in planar graphs, the so called meshedness co-
eﬃcient M [18]. The meshedness coeﬃcient is deﬁned as
M = F/Fmax, where F is the number of faces (excluding
the external ones) associated with a planar graph with N

original map (top-left), and reduced into a spatial graph (top-
right). We also report the corresponding MST (bottom-left)
and GT (bottom-right).

B. Graph local properties

The degree of a node is the number of its direct connec-
tions to other nodes. In terms of the adjacency matrix,
the degree ki of node i is deﬁned as ki = Pj=1,N aij.
In many real networks, the degree distribution P (k), de-
ﬁned as the probability that a node chosen uniformly
at random has degree k or, equivalently, as the fraction
of nodes in the graph having degree k, signiﬁcantly devi-
ates from the Poisson distribution expected for a random
graph and exhibits a power law (scale-free) tail with an
exponent γ taking a value between 2 and 3 [1, 2, 4]. As
already mentioned in the introduction, we do not expect
to ﬁnd scale-free degree distributions in planar networks
because the node degree is limited by the spatial em-
bedding. In particular, in the networks of urban street
patterns considered, it is very unprobable to ﬁnd an in-
tersection with more than 5 or 6 streets. In Fig. 2 we
report the average degree hki, and the degree distribu-
tion P (k) for k going from 1 to 5. The cities are labeled
with an index going from 1 to 20, the same index we
have used in Table I. In all the samples considered, the
largest number of nodes have a degree equal to 3 or 4.
Self-organized cities as Ahmedabad, Bologna, Cairo and
Venice have P (k = 3) > P (k = 4), while the inverse is
true for most of the single-planned cities as New York,
San Francisco and Washington, because of their square-
grid structure. It is not the aim of this article to discuss
the meaning of such diﬀerences in terms of their possible

nodes and K edges, and expressed by the Euler formula
in terms of number of nodes and edges as: F = K −N +1.
Fmax is the maximum possible number of faces that is ob-
tained in the maximally connected planar graph i.e.
in
a graph with N nodes and Kmax = 3N − 6 edges. Thus
Fmax = 2N − 5 and the meshedness coeﬃcient can vary
from zero (tree structure) to one (maximally connected
planar graph, as in the GT [35]).

k

Here, we have evaluated the meshedness coeﬃcient M
for each of the twenty cities. In addition, we have counted
the cycles of length three, four and ﬁve by using the
properties of powers of the adjacency matrix A. E.g.,
the number of cycles of length three is simply equal to
1/6Tr(A3)
[36]. We have denoted by Ck the number
of cycles of length k in a given city, and by CGT
the
same number in the corresponding GT. The results are
reported in Table II. Three are the cities with a value
of meshedness larger than 0.3: New York, Savannah and
San Francisco. These represents the most complex forms
of cities. On the other hand, Irvine and Walnut Creek
with a value of M lower than 0.1, have a tree-like struc-
ture. Notice that both the ﬁrst and the second group
of cities are examples of planned urban fabrics. On the
other hand, organic patterns such as Ahmedabad, Cairo
and Seoul also exhibit high values of mashedness, which
means a considerable potential of local clustering. Thus,
beside the suburban “lollipop” layout, both grid planned
and organic self-organized patterns do show good lo-
cal performances in terms of the local structural prop-
erties of the network: this is even more interesting if
coupled with our previous ﬁnding that such two classes
of patterns perform radically diﬀerent in terms of how

5

centrality ﬂows over the network, the former exhibiting
power-laws distributions while the latter single-scale ex-
ponential distributions [20]. In most of the samples we
have found a rather small value of C3/CGT
(as com-
3
pared, for instance, to C4/CGT
), denoting that trian-
gles are not common in urban city patterns. This is
another proof that the clustering coeﬃcient C alone is

while Irvine1, Richmond, Brasilia and Paris are the cities
with the largest value of C3/CGT
. In 17 samples out of
20 we have found C4/CGT

and Irvine 2 are the only cities having a prevalence of tri-
angles with respect to squares. San Francisco, New York,
Washinghton, Savannah and Barcelona are the cities with
the largest value of C4/CGT

concerning C5/CGT

C. Graph global properties

One of the possible mechanisms ruling the growth of
an urban systems is the achievement of eﬃcient pedes-
trian and vehicular movements on a global scale. This
has important consequences on a number of relevant fac-
tors aﬀecting the economic, environmental and social per-
formances of cities, ranging from accessibility to micro-
criminality and land-uses [37]. The global eﬃciency of
an urban pattern in exchanging goods, people and ideas
should be considered a reference when the capacity of
that city to support its internal relational potential is
questioned. It is especially important to develop a mea-
sure that allows the comparison between cases of diﬀerent
form and size, which poses a problem of normalization
[38]. The global structural properties of a graph can be
evaluated by the analysis of the shortest paths between
all pairs of nodes. In a relational (unweighted) network
the shortest path length between two nodes i and j is
the minimum number of edges to traverse to go from i
to j. In a spatial (weigthed) graph, instead we deﬁne the
shortest path length dij as the smallest sum of the edge
lengths throughout all the possible paths in the graph
from i to j [21, 22]. In this way, both the topology and
the geography of the system is taken into account. As a
measure of the eﬃciency in the communication between
the nodes of a spatial graph, we use the so called global
eﬃciency E, a measure deﬁned in Ref. [21] as:

1

E =

N (N − 1) X
i,j,i6=j

dEucl
ij
dij

(2)

Here, dEucl
is the distance between nodes i and j along a
straight line, deﬁned in Section II A, and we have adopted

ij

thus deﬁne a normalized cost measure, Costrel, as:

Costrel =

Cost − CostMST
CostGT − CostMST

By deﬁnition the MST has a relative cost Costrel = 0,
while GT has Costrel = 1. In Fig. 3 we plot for each city
Erel as a function of Costrel. The cities can be a-priori

TABLE III: The eﬃciency E of each city is compared to the
minimum and maximum values of the eﬃciency obtained re-
spectively for the MST and the GT. The cities are labeled
from 1 to 20 as in Table I

a normalization recently proposed for geographic net-
works [39]. Such a normalization captures to which ex-
tent the connecting route between i and j deviates from
the virtual straight line. In Table III we report the values
of eﬃciency obtained for each city and for the respective
MST and the GT. The values of EMST and EGT serve
to normalize the results, being respectively the minimum
and the maximum value of eﬃciency that can be obtained
in a planar graph having the same number of nodes as in
the original graph of the city. Notice that Irvine 2 is the
only case in which E < EMST . This is simply due to the
fact that Irvine 2 is the only city whose corresponding
graph is not connected. Consequently, the MST has a
smaller number of edges but a higher value of eﬃciency
because it is, by deﬁnition, a connected graph. The main
result is that the cities considered, despite their inherent
diﬀerences, achieve a relatively high value of eﬃciency,
which is in most of the cases about 80% of the maximum
value of the eﬃciency in a planar graph, EGT . Following
Ref. [18] we deﬁne the relative eﬃciency Erel as:

Erel =

E − EMST
EGT − EMST

(3)

Of course, the counterpart of an increase in eﬃciency is
an increase in the cost of construction, i.e. an increase
in the number and length of the edges. The cost of con-
struction can be quantiﬁed by using the measure Cost
deﬁned in formula (1). Given a set of N nodes, the short-
est (minimal cost) planar graph that connects all nodes
correspons to the MST, while a good approximation for
the maximum cost planar graph is given by the GT. We

FIG. 3: Relation beetween relative cost, Crel, and relative eﬃ-
ciency, Erel. Each point in the plot represent a city. The point
of coordinates (0,0) would correspond to the cost/eﬃciency of
the MST while the point (1,1) would correspond to the GT

divided into diﬀerent classes: 1) medieval fabrics, includ-
ing both arabic (Ahmedabad and Cairo) and european
(Bologna, London, Venice, and Vienna); 2) grid-iron fab-
rics (Barcelona, Los Angeles, New York, Richmond, Sa-
vannah and San Francisco); 3) modernist fabrics (Brasilia
and Irvine 1); 4) baroque fabrics (New Delhi and Wash-
ington); 5) mixed fabrics (Paris and Seoul); 6) “lollipop”
layouts (Irvine 2 and Walnut Creek). We shall see that
the plot Erel vs. Crel has a certain capacity to character-
ize the diﬀerent classes of cities listed above. The plot in-
dicates an overall increasing behavior of Erel as function
of Costrel, with a saturation at Erel ∼ 0.8 for values of
Costrel > 0.3. Grid-iron patterns exhibit a high value of
relative eﬃciency, about 70 − 80% of the eﬃciency of the
GT, with a relative cost which goes from 0.24 to 0.4. The
three grid-iron cities (New York, Savannah and San Fran-
cisco) with the largest value of eﬃciency, Erel ∼ 0.8, have
respectively a cost equal to 0.342, 0.354 and 0.383. Me-
dieval patterns have in general a lower cost and eﬃciency
than grid-iron patterns althouh, in some cases as Ahmed-
abad and Cairo (the two medieval cities with the largest
eﬃciency), they can also reach a value of Erel ∼ 0.8 with
a smaller cost equal to 0.29. Modernist and “lollipop”
layouts are those with the smallest value of Cost but also
with the smallest value of eﬃciency.

III. CONCLUSIONS

We have proposed a method to characterize both the
local and the global properties of spatial graphs repre-
senting urban street patterns. Our results show that a
comparative analysis on the structure of diﬀerent world
cities is possible by the introduction of two limiting aux-
iliary graphs, the MST and the GT, A certain level of

structural similarities across cities as well as some diﬀer-
ence are well captured by counting cycles and by mea-
suring normalized eﬃciency and cost of the graphs. The
method can be applied to other planar graphs of diﬀerent
nature, as highway or railway networks.

[35] In the computed GT, the graphs we have obtained have
6 edges. This is due to the fact that we have
less than 3N
considered all the edges as being straight-lines connect-
ing the two end-nodes. For such a reason some of edges
connecting the external nodes (the nodes on the border of
the unit square) cannot be placed without causing edge
crossings. However, the number of these edges is of the
order of √N , so that in large GT graphs the meshedness
is close to 1.

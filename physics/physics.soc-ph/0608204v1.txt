Abstract
The language competition model of Viviane de Oliveira et al is modiﬁed by
associating with each language a string of 32 bits. Whenever a language changes in
this Viviane model, also one randomly selected bit is ﬂipped. If then only languages
with diﬀerent bit-strings are counted as diﬀerent, the resulting size distribution of
languages agrees with the empirically observed slightly asymmetric log-normal
distribution. Several other modiﬁcations were also tried but either had more free
parameters or agreed less well with reality.

1 Introduction

The competition between languages of adult humans, leading to the extinc-
tion of some, the emergence of new and the modiﬁcation of existing lan-
guages, has been simulated recently by many physicists [1-11] and others
[12-14], see also [15] for the learning of languages by children. The web site
http://www.isrl.uiuc.edu/amag/langev/ lists 103 linguistic computer simula-
tions, and recent reviews of language competition simulations were given in
[16-18]. Perhaps the empirically best-known aspect of language competition
is the present distribution ns of language sizes s, where the size s of the

binned in powers of two. The curve shows a ﬁtted parabola, corresponding to

higher than this parabolic ﬁt. From [23].

language is deﬁned as the number of people speaking mainly this language,
and ns is the number of diﬀerent languages spoken by s people. We leave
it to linguists and politicians to distinguish languages from dialects and rely
on the widely used “Ethnologue” statistics [19-22] repeated in Fig.1. This
log-log plot shows a slightly asymmetric parabola, corresponding to a log-
normal distribution with enhancement for small sizes s ∼ 10. Our aim is to
reproduce this empirically observed distribution in an equilibrium simulation;
previously it was achieved only for non-equilibrium [23].

Of the many models cited above only the “Schulze” model [4] and the “Vi-
viane” model [8] gave thousands of languages as in reality. The Schulze model
gave a reasonable ns distribution in non-equilibrium [23], when observed dur-
ing its phase transition between the dominance of one language spoken by
most people and the fragmentation into numerous small languages. The Vi-

2

viane model does not have such a phase transition [17], and we now attempt
to get from it a realistic ns in equilibrium.

The next section deﬁnes the standard Viviane model [8] for the reader’s
convenience. Section 3 gives our bit-string modiﬁcation and the improved re-
sulting ns, while Section 4 lists other attempts to get a good size distribution.
The concluding section 5 compares our various attempts.

2 Viviane Model

The original Viviane model [8] simulates the spread of humans over a pre-
viously uninhabited continent. Each site j of an L × L square lattice can
later be populated by cj people, where cj is initially ﬁxed randomly between
1 and m ∼ 102. On a populated site only one language is spoken. Initially
only one single site i is occupied by ci people.

Then as in Eden cluster growth or Leath percolation algorithm, at each
time step one surface site (= empty neighbour j of the set of all occupied sites)
is selected randomly, and then occupied with probability cj/m by cj people.
These settlers ﬁrst select as language that of one of their occupied neighbour
sites, with a probability proportional to the ﬁtness of that language. This
ﬁtness Fk is the total number of people speaking the language k of that site,
summed over all lattice sites occupied at that time. (In [9], this ﬁtness was
bounded from above by a maximum Mk selected randomly between 1 and
Mmax ∼ 20m.) After a language is selected, it is mutated into a new language
with probability α/Fk with a mutation factor α typically between 10−3 and
1. From then on the population and language of the just occupied lattice site
remain constant. Equilibrium is reached when all lattice sites have become
occupied and the simulation stops. As a result of this algorithm, the various
languages are numbered 1, 2, 3, ... without any internal structure of the
languages.

The resulting language size distribution ns in Fig.2 has a sharp maximum
near s ∼ m, and follows one power law (exponent 1) to the left of the
maximum and another power law to its right. As in reality it extends from
s = 1 to s = 109 for the number s of people speaking one language. But the
sharp maximum is not seen in reality, Fig.1, and the simulated slope on the
right of the maximum is weaker than the one at its left, while reality shows
the opposite asymmetry: Less slope on the left than on the right.

With increasing mutation factor α, the fraction of people speaking the

largest language decreases smoothly, Fig.3, without showing a sharp phase
transition (in contrast to the Schulze model). For increasing lattice size L
the curves shift slightly (logarithmically ?) to smaller α values.

(The program listed in [17] gave a limiting ﬁtness Mj to each site j,
instead of an Mk to each language. Thus before the mutations are simulated
we need there the line f(lang(j))=min(limit(lang(j)), f(lang(j)) +
c(j)*fac). This mistake barely aﬀects the ns, Fig.2, but after correction
the resulting size eﬀect in our Fig.3 is weaker than in Fig.3 of [17].)

3 Bit-string modiﬁcation

We now improve the Viviane model in three ways:

i) We give the Viviane languages an internal structure by associating with

Mutation factor

The linear lattice size L increases from right to left. For mutation factor
α = 0 by deﬁnition everybody speaks the language of the initially occupied
site.

each language a string of, say, ℓ = 16 bits, initially all set to zero. At each
mutation of the language at the newly occupied site, one randomly selected
bit is ﬂipped, from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0. We count languages as diﬀerent
only if they have diﬀerent bit-strings. Otherwise the standard algorithm is
unchanged. Thus our new bit-strings do not inﬂuence the dynamics of the
population spread, only the counting of languages.

ii) Thus far the populations cj per site j were homogeneously distributed
between 1 and m. In reality, there are more bad than good sites for human
settlement. We approximate this eﬀect by assuming that the values of c,
to be scattered between 1 and m, no longer are distributed with a constant
probability but with a probability proportional to 1/c.

iii) Instead of occupying one randomly selected surface site i with prob-
ability proportional to ci, we saved lots of computer time by selecting two

5

such surface sites and occupying the one with the bigger c.

(As a minor improvement we counted a neighbour language only once if

two or more neighbours of the just occupied site speak that language.)

Figure 4: Language size distribution for bit-string version, L = 15000, m =
250, Mmax = 300, α = 0.05, ℓ = 14 bits.

Fig.4 shows that these modiﬁcations are good enough to result in reason-
able agreement with reality, Fig.1. The shape of the curve is robust against
a wide variation of the parameters. We do not show plots for diﬀerent m
since 1 ≤ Fj ≤ m and for ﬁxed m/Mmax the simulations depend only on the
ratio α/Fj. The total number of languages is only 5 × 103, less then the real
[19] value 7 × 103 for which we would need bigger lattices than our computer
memory can store.

As in [24] for the Schulze model, the bit-strings allow a study of spatial
correlations: What is the Hamming distance for languages separated by a
distance r? The Hamming distance for two bit-strings, used already in [25,
24] for the Schulze model, is the number of bits which diﬀer from each other
in a position-by-position comparison of the two bit-strings. Thus initially we

6

occupy the top line of the L × L lattice with L diﬀerent languages, all having
bit-string zero, then start the standard Viviane dynamics, and at the end we
sum over all Hamming distances of all sites on lattice line r, compared with
the corresponding sites on the ﬁrst lattice line. (By deﬁnition, this Hamming
distance is zero for r = 1.) Fig.5 shows our correlation functions, similar to
reality [24, 26]; the higher the mutation factor α, the higher the Hamming
distance. This simulation for Fig. 5 used only modiﬁcation i) and involved
no counting of languages.

4 Other modiﬁcations

4.1 Noise

Ref.[23] improved the language size distribution of the Schulze model by
applying random multiplicative noise, that means by multiplying at the end
of one simulation each ns repeatedly by a random number taken between 0.9
and 1.1. This modiﬁcation approximates external inﬂuences from outside the
basic model. Such noise is applied in Fig.6 to the standard Viviane model
with the additional modiﬁcation of correlations: each random number is used
twice, one after the other. Here we multiplied each ns thousand times by a
factor (0.9 + 0.2z)2 at each iteration, and we summed over thousand samples.
(Here z is a random number homogeneously distributed between 0 and 1.)
We start the simulations with a small mutation factor α = 0.001 and for
each iteration this grows linearly until it reaches a values of α = 0.916, for
all lattices sizes used here: L = 257, 513, 1023, 2047 and 4095. Fig.6 shows
a slightly asymmetric parabola, but as in Fig.2 with the wrong asymmetry:
Too slow decay on the right.

4.2 Power law for populations per site

Using only modiﬁcation ii) of section 3, and adding random multiplicative
noise (100 multiplications with 0.9 + 0.2z, without correlations), Fig.7 now
shows reasonable asymmetric parabolas for equilibrium, similar to [23] for
the non-equilibrium Schulze model.

4.3

Indigenous population

We modiﬁed the standard Viviane model by assuming that initially the lattice
is not empty but is occupied by a native population which in our simulation
is then overrun by some foreign invaders. Thus initially each lattice site gets
a native ﬁtness 1/z where z is a random number homogeneously distributed
between zero and one. In the later conquest by the foreign invaders, this site
is conquered only if the ﬁtness of the invader is larger than the native ﬁtness
(minus 10). It is possible that a few sites cannot be conquered, since they
are defended by Asterix, Obelix or other powerful natives.

We found that this modiﬁcation barely changes the ﬁnal distribution of
language sizes. For various mutation factors α, Fig. 8 shows that again we

have two power laws (straight lines in this log-log plot) for small and for
large language sizes. The time after which the “conquistadores” ﬁnish their
conquest varies very little from sample to sample (not shown). Adding as
before random multiplicative noise by 100 multiplications by 0.9+0.2z makes
the maximum more smooth (not shown), but still with the wrong asymmetry.

5 Conclusion

While we have oﬀered various modiﬁcations in order to improve the results
from the standard Viviane model, we think the one of section 3 is the best
since it is simple and introduced no new free parameters except ℓ. We have
seen a reasonable agreement with the slightly asymmetric log-normal dis-
tribution of language sizes. Future work could replace the bits by integer
variables between 1 and Q as in some Schulze models [17], or look at lan-
guage families [27].

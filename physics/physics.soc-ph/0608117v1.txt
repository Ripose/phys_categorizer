By means of laboratory experiment I examine the relation between

fairness judgments made `behind the veil of ignorane' and atual behavior

in a model situation of inome inequality. As the evidene shows, when

material self-interest is at stake vast ma jority of sub jets tends to abandon

the fairness norm. Rather small regard for e(cid:30)ieny is present in the data.

Furthermore, as low inome players go through a sequene of games against

high earners and experiene hanges in inome disparity, the history e(cid:27)et

proves to override strutural harateristis of the redistribution game.

1. Introdution

For good or for ill, inome redistribution is one of the key funtions

assumed by modern governments. The underlying motive for it, as it is

prevalently professed, is either a sympathy for the plight of the destitute,

or a need to urtail the unjusti(cid:28)able inequalities though, to be sure, it is

far from ommon agreement what a justi(cid:28)able division of inome atually

amounts to. To make matters all the more harder to analyze and judge,

redistribution takes on so diverse forms that in some ases it may be nigh

impossible to determine the net e(cid:27)et of inome transfers. To give just one

example, state-(cid:28)naned higher eduation, for a big part of it, is a vehile

for transfering funds from lower to higher inome families [1, 2℄. Now the

aim of this paper is not to disentangle all the intriaies of the redistributive

mahinery but rather to srutinize the link between fairness judgments about

inome division and atual behavior in model situation of inome disparity

under ontrollable onditions of laboratory experiment. In doing so, I follow

the ever widening path of researh on inome redistribution onduted under

the general heading of bargaining games in experimental eonomis (see

[3, 4, 5, 6, 7℄). Readers interested in theoretial analysis of the phenomenon

are referred to [8℄ and partiularly [2℄.

The basis for this paper is the experiment I onduted in May 2005.

The experiment onsisted of two parts, pretest and experimental proper.

All in all, 84 students partiipated in the (cid:28)rst ommon meeting, and of

this number 72 proeeded to subsequent experimental sessions. In total 12

six-person sessions were held and eah sub jet partiipated in one.

The aim of the (cid:28)rst ommon meeting was twofold. First, all partiipants

were requested to (cid:28)ll a questionnaire on eonomi and politial issues, as well

as they were asked to make ertain deisions dealing with division of money.

Seond, they were to earn money by performing tasks assigned to them. As

I ventured on a study of redistributive behavior and its relation to fairness

judgments, it was ruial that sub jets' initial payo(cid:27)s were earned in suh

a way as to make the evaluation of fair distribution possible. I took pains

to ensure that 1) task would be reasonably easy to perform yet 2) require

various degrees of e(cid:27)ort; 3) performane ould be expliitly measured, and

4) sub jets should be able to assess their e(cid:27)ort's worth.

It is espeially

unommon in vast experimental literature that ondition 4 is met. The usual

way to endow human sub jets with initial inomes in all sorts of bargaining

games is either by random rule, or aording to persons' sores on some

kind of a test. In former ase payo(cid:27)s result from sheer luk, either good

or bad.

In latter ase one may attribute them to sub jets' performanes

yet it is at best unlear why partiular payo(cid:27) sheme should be employed,

whih leaves muh room for sub jets' uneliited disapproval of a sheme

atually enfored by the researher. In my experiment gainful task onsisted

in deoding one, two or four (cid:28)xed-size fragments of Chronia Polonorum by

Gall the Anonym (in its Polish translation, to be sure). Enryption method

was a straightforward injetion from the harater set to a set of speial

symbols or ideograms, and a suitable `ditionary' was provided at the top of

eah sheet. Partiipants' evaluation of task's worth was eliited by means

of `request for quotation' tehnique, i. e. all sub jets were requested to

quote, independently and in seret, their pries for deoding one, two and

four sheets, and the lowest quoters were to get extra jobs for pries they

named. As a matter of fat, 92% of the `full-time' sub jets quoted pries

below the ones atually implemented and thus we may onlude that, save 6

exeptions out of 72, sub jets had no intrinsi reason to be dissatis(cid:28)ed with

initial payo(cid:27)s they earned.

2. Deisions behind the veil of ignorane

Before eah experimental sub jet atually learned whether he was to de-

ode one, two or four sheets, as well as before he was told that a reompense

for deoding eah single sheet was 15 PLN, he had been requested to do the

following:

Consider three persons, of whom Person A solved one sheet, Person B solved

two sheets, and Person C solved four sheets. Suppose you have a total of

105 PLN to distribute among these three persons. How muh would you

pay to A, B and C respetively?

As sub jets were yet unaware of their own inome positions, their judgments

were not marred by self-interested onsiderations and we may regard them

as indiative of their true justie preferenes. Sine atual payo(cid:27)s were (cid:28)xed

at a pieework basis it was important whether sub jetive fairness norms also

posited a proportional 15-30-60 PLN division, and if not, what kind of bias

they showed. In order to grasp it, I represented payo(cid:27) sale as a weightless

seond-lass lever of length 4 held in equilibrium by vertial fore applied at

the end of it. Amounts of work (1, 2, 4) were rendered as points on the lever

arm at distanes 1, 2, and 4 from the fulrum respetively, and orresponding

`fair' payo(cid:27)s were represented as loads attahed to the arm at those points.

The proportionality (π) of a given fair payo(cid:27) vetor was then de(cid:28)ned as the

ratio between the moments of fore around the fulrum produed by `fair

loading' and `proportional loading' (the latter quantity being 1 × 15 + 2 ×
30 + 4 × 60 = 315 units). To be sure, proportional fairness produes π=1

whereas every transfer from lower to higher inome person inreases value

of π and vie versa. As the results show, pieework solution (π = 1) is a

single self-evident fairness rule, supported by 42 out of 72 `full-time' sub jets

(58%)

. Other hoies go both ways reahing minimum at .92 (for 20-35-

1

50 division) and maximum at 1.11 (for 10-20-75). We dare say that atual

support for proportionality ould be even higher, had the total disposable

lump sum been set at eg. 70 PLN thus making proportional division (10-20-

40) somewhat more onspiuous for non-mathematially oriented sub jets.

After making their hoies on 105 PLN division, sub jets were told what

was the atual prie for deoding eah single sheet and they were asked to

open envelopes (handed out to them at the very beginning) in whih they

were to (cid:28)nd either one, or two, or four sheets of text to be derypted on

the spot. It was also made lear to the partiipants that all payments (15

PLN show-up fee inluded) should be realized only at the end of eah of the

forthoming experimental sessions.

1

Of ourse other payo(cid:27) vetors, e.g. 17-27-61 PLN, may yield π = 1 as well but it was

not the ase with our sub jets.

3. The redistribution game

3.1. Stage game

Redistribution game involves two players with unequal initial inomes

.

2

For onveniene sake from now on I will refer to the players as H and L (H for

high and L for low inome). Game onsists of two onseutive parts. First,

both members of the `dyad soiety' are to demoratially establish the rate of

redistributive inome tax whih bene(cid:28)ts L at the expense of H. E(cid:27)etive tax

rate is an average of the rates simultaneously and independently proposed by

both players and may be anything from 0 to 100%. However, (cid:28)sal transfer

entails exeutive ost de(cid:28)ned as a perentage of total tax revenues and thus

(cid:28)sal redistribution always leads to e(cid:30)ieny loss. To present redistributive

tax mehanism formally, let us denote players' initial payo(cid:27)s as pH and pL ,
their tax votes as tH and tL , and the (cid:28)sal ost as C. Players' after-tax

payo(cid:27)s are then given by the following formula:

p′
i(T ) = (1 − T )pi + T (1 − C)¯p

where T =

1
2 (tH + tL) and ¯p =

1
2 (pH + pL). As one may easily alulate,

H su(cid:27)ers from any positive taxation, while L bene(cid:28)ts i(cid:27) his initial payo(cid:27) is

small enough, viz. pL < (1 − C)¯p. In my experiment three types of `dyad

soieties' were formed, depending on sub jets' earnings, namely: 30-15 PLN,

60-30 PLN, and 60-15 PLN, and there were two possible levels of exeutive

ost: 10 or 30%. Under any of these onditions, player L bene(cid:28)ts from the

operation of tax mehanism. Obviously, as far as strit material interest

is onerned, optimal deision is for L to vote 100% and for H to vote 0%

whih results in 50% tax rate. Thus tax system may also be pereived as a

tool with whih L may take over some part of H's initial inome, while at

the same time part of H's inome is lost due to exeutive ost. L's gain and

H's harm from 50% tax redistribution for eah ombination of the type of

dyad and the ost level atualized in the experiment are presented in Table

1. The e(cid:30)ieny of (cid:28)sal transfer, or a portion of money taken from H by

means of tax system whih (cid:28)nds its way to L, is given by τL/τH .

After (cid:28)sal transfers have been realized, players have an option to pass

some portion of their after-tax inome to eah other (again, deisions are

taken simultaneously with no ommuniation between players). These vol-

untary transfers are ostless as there is no need to employ resoures to fore

2

Players' initial inomes ould also be equal but then there would be no inentive for

any redistribution whatsoever. The game ould also be easily transformed to inlude

more than two players, though in our experiment we employed only its two-person

version. For a detailed analysis of in(cid:28)nitely repeated two-person redistribution game

see my artile [9℄.

be the amount lost by H as a onsequene. To see dilemmati nature of

the game, suppose H onsiders a free transfer to L, gH = γH , suh that
τL < γH < τH while L hooses between tax vote of 0 and 1.

As Table 2 reveals, both players have dominant strategies:

for L it is

to vote tL = 1, while for H it is to donate nothing, gH = 0. Both players,
however, should be better o(cid:27) if L voted tL = 0 and H donated gH = γH .

This feature of the redistribution game makes it a semblane of asymmetri

ontinuous prisoner's dilemma.

3.2. Experimental proedure

All in all, 12 experimental sessions were held, eah of them inluding six

sub jets: two low earners of 15 PLN (S1), two medium earners of 30 PLN

(S2), and two high earners of 60 PLN (S4)

. After having been aquainted

3

with the workings of redistributive tax mehanism, sub jets underwent a

four-round trial game, and then proeeded to four `real' twelve-round games

(single round being the stage game desribed in the previous paragraph).

Sub jets' initial inomes at the beginning of eah round were equal to what

3

Total size of a single group had to be limited for tehnial reasons.

they had earned during the pre-experimental meeting. To be sure, S1s in all

their games oupied L position, S4s were in H position all the time, while

S2s were in H position when playing against S1, and in L position when

playing against S4.

All games were played in loal omputer network and sub jets ould not

ommuniate with eah other, exept they were being informed on a urrent

basis about deisions made by the other player

. All the time they also had

4

in view gradually updated history panel with data on their own as well as

their partner's tax votes, after-tax inomes, free transfers and resulting (cid:28)nal

inomes for eah ompleted round.

It was made expliitly known to the

sub jets that their ultimate payo(cid:27) from the experiment (in ash) would be

an average over all rounds' (cid:28)nal payo(cid:27)s so eah deision they were to make

would bear (cid:28)nanial onsequenes both for them and their partners.

Eah sub jet played four 12-round redistribution games, going through

all four partner-ost on(cid:28)gurations. Depending on order of partners and

order of (cid:28)sal osts, there were four possible histories for eah type of player.

By way of example, low inome player's history of games ould be one of

the following ((cid:28)sal ost in parentheses):

1. [S1-S4 (10%)

S1-S4 (30%)℄

[S1-S2 (10%)

Thus sub jet's partners, aording to their inome levels, were ordered either

deendingly (histories 1 or 2) or asendingly (histories 3 or 4). The same

is the ase with the ost order within the doubleheaders

: sub jets with

5

history 1 or 3 experiened growing ost, while sub jets with history 2 or 4

experiened diminishing ost. Important feature of this sheme is that S1-S4

(as well as S1-S2) games are played under two muh di(cid:27)erent irumstanes.

In history onditions 1 and 2, we have inexperiened S1 mathed with equally

inexperiened S4. However, in history onditions 3 and 4, when it omes

to S1-S4 doubleheader, S1 has already had experiene of playing against

S2 in (cid:28)rst two games(cid:22)and the same holds true for S4 who has already

been playing against S2 in his (cid:28)rst two games.

In this manner, we may

examine the impat of history on redistributive behavior. Mutatis mutandis,

all things said above apply to medium and high earners as well.

Program was waiting until both sub jets made their deisions and only then their

hoies were revealed to eah other.

There was no hange of partners within the doubleheader, though sub jets were not

informed that they played two onseutive games against the same person. In the

listing above, the-same-partner games are rendered by means of square brakets.

4. Results

4.1. Justie onsiderations

First thing to be notied in the empirial data on redistribution game is a

vast disregard for e(cid:30)ieny manifest in mean tax votes made by lower earners

of the dyads, whih is in stark ontradition with the data one typially gets

in survey studies. Basially, respondents laim that no transfer should be

made if the e(cid:30)ieny loss exeeds 20-30% [7℄. Now if you reall Table 1, the

most e(cid:30)ient game in our set was 60-15 PLN under 10% (cid:28)sal ost, and in

this very ase e(cid:30)ieny loss amounted to no less than 29%. In all other ases

transfers were even less e(cid:30)ient, with extreme at 60-30 PLN and 30-15 PLN

under 30% (cid:28)sal ost, in whih outrageous 95% of the transfer was bound

to be lost. Now sub jets' atual behavior in redistribution game amply

demonstrates the di(cid:27)erene between `heap talk' and deisions made when

one's monetary interest is at stake. Table 3 shows mean tax votes, (cid:28)nal

inomes and free transfers from H to L (orreted for the amount L sent

bak) obtained in the (cid:28)rst two games, viz. before the hange of partners

took plae.

Of the three types of dyads, only in 30-15 PLN ondition there was a

signi(cid:28)ant impat of (cid:28)sal ost on L's voting behavior(cid:22)under heavier ost

his tax laim was lesser by 16 perentage points (Wiloxon's mathed-pairs

signed-ranks test, p=0.042). Still, even here under the extremely ine(cid:30)ient

30% (cid:28)sal ost, meaning that only 1 grosz (cid:28)nds its way to the low-inome

voter out of every 20 taken from the high earner, L's average tax vote ex-

eeded 40%. It is also to be noted that where tax transfers are extremely

ine(cid:30)ient (30-15 and 60-30 PLN dyads under 30% ost) one may expet free

transfers from H to ontribute more to L's welfare than tax redistribution

does. Indeed, in the 30-15 dyads low earners ultimately inreased their pay-

o(cid:27) by 0.80 PLN (from initial 15.00 to 15.80) but lion's share of that inrease,

0.64 PLN, was due to free transfers on part of the `rih'. And it is quite

similar with 60-30 dyads in whih 2.34 out of 2.76 PLN inrease ame from

H, leaving only 0.42 PLN for workings of the tax system.

Certainly, it is also a learly evident trait in the data that larger relative

inome disparity makes the appetite for redistribution harder to resist. In

60-15 PLN dyad, mean tax vote by L was at least 20 perentage points

higher than in the other two types of dyads. This is true both for 10 and

30% (cid:28)sal ost, though only under 30% ost the di(cid:27)erene turns out to be

statistially signi(cid:28)ant (Kruskal-Wallis test, p=0.03).

However ine(cid:30)ient sub jets' hoies might have been, they might have

still re(cid:29)eted their a priori distributive justie preferenes. As far as L's

hoies are onerned, they might have a(cid:27)eted H's payo(cid:27)s in two ways:

diminish them by positive tax vote and/or inrease them by means of a free

transfer. What we are going to do now is alulate what H's (cid:28)nal payo(cid:27)

would be if it depended solely upon L's deisions (i.e. if H had not redued

his own payo(cid:27) either by a non-zero tax vote, or by a non-zero free transfer).

Then we should ompare the resulting sum with L's beliefs, eliited behind

the veil of ignorane, on what his opponent's fair payo(cid:27) should be.

Suppose there was enough money to defray `fair' payo(cid:27)s for both of them

while H's `fair' payo(cid:27) did not exeed his atual initial inome. The former

ondition guarantees that in order to abide H's `fair' payo(cid:27), L did not have

to give up a bit of his own `fair' payo(cid:27), while the latter ondition ensures

that following L's fairness rule demanded of him no more than preserving

status quo. As a matter of fat, was H's `fair' payo(cid:27) smaller than his initial

inome in the game, fairness rule would even allow a ertain dose of tax

redistribution. Under suh irumstanes, if L's ations had driven his part-

ner's payo(cid:27) below the 'fair' level, then it would learly indiate that some

other onsiderations, be it self-interest or envy, have been at work here that

ultimately turned out to override any regard for fairness. Now in 29 out of

total 35 games that were played as (cid:28)rst in a series of four, the sum of initial

inomes was atually greater or equal to the sum of L's and H's `fair' payo(cid:27)s

as pereived by L, and in none of these games H's `fair' payo(cid:27) exeeded his

initial inome. As results show, in 23 out of those 29 games sub jets in L

position (79%) violated their own fairness rules. In 60-15 PLN dyads, whih

o(cid:27)ered strongest material inentives for L to exploit tax system, ma jority

of low earners went as far as diminishing H's `fair' payo(cid:27) by more than 10

PLN.

4.2. History e(cid:27)et

In previous paragraph we analyzed only (cid:28)rst-partner games. Let us now

examine how (cid:28)rst-partner experiene a(cid:27)eted voting behavior of 15 PLN

earners in their seond-partner games. When we onsider all 15-60 games,

FENS_Czarnik

half of them was played with no experiene at all, and half of them was

played after both L and H had already played a doubleheader against 30

PLN earners. Similarly, half of all 15-30 games were played by inexperiened

sub jets, while the other half was played by sub jets who had already been

through a doubleheader vs. 60 PLN earners. Now, as the evidene shows,

impat of history is virtually overwhelming.

Figure 1. Impat of history on low earner's tax voting

In (cid:28)rst-partner games, as it was mentioned before, larger inome dis-

parity resulted in low earners's greater demand for tax redistribution, and

it was espeially visible under 30% (cid:28)sal ost. Now the results from the

seond-partner games are in striking ontrast to this: appetite for redistri-

bution grows substantially in 15-30 games and it lessens in 15-60 games so

that eventually the relation between inome disparity and demand for (cid:28)sal

redistribution is reversed. A plausible explanation of the phenomenon is

that in terms of inertia present in soial systems. In spite of a signi(cid:28)ant

hange in environment, sub jets tended to inherit, to some extent, their be-

havior from before the hange. Low earners who played their (cid:28)rst two games

against sub jets four times riher than themselves learned that aggressive

tax voting pays o(cid:27) and their moral relutane to exploit the better-o(cid:27) party,

if any relutane they had indeed, must have been weakened. Thus when in

the last two games they were onfronted with sub jets merely twie riher,

it was relatively easier for them to forego fairness onsiderations and at on

their self-interest. The reverse is true in ase of low inome players whose

(cid:28)rst experiene was with 30 PLN earners:

it was neither so bene(cid:28)ial to

10

FENS_Czarnik printed on 25th July 2013

indulge in tax redistribution, nor it seemed so muh justi(cid:28)ed to exploit sub-

jets whose initial inome was medium rather than high. In this manner

low earners, so to say, learned to ontain their appetite for redistribution at

the expense of the riher party, and it was relatively easier for them to stik

to the fairness rule one they ame up against 60 PLN Croesus. However

plausible this a posteriori explanation may seem, it is still surprising that

the history e(cid:27)et was so powerful as to ompletely override the inentives

inherent in the struture of the games.

5. Conluding remarks

The outright dominane of self interest over a priori justie onsiderations

is readily observable in the ontrast between hoies made behind the veil

of ignorane and those made in the ourse of the game. Sub jets in lower

inome position were taking advantage of redistributive (cid:28)sal mehanism

even in fae of the gravest e(cid:30)ieny loss. It is a rather sorry information

for those who would like to infer people's attitudes towards tax system from

their responses to survey questions.

As far as dynamis of redistribution are onerned, we may sketh two

broad onlusions. First, substantial amount of inertia is present in soial

system, and one should not expet immediate shift in behavioral patterns

even under heavy strutural hange. Seond(cid:22)as risky as real-life general-

izations made on the basis of a ontrolled laboratory experiment may be(cid:22)it

seems that while in soieties with growing inome inequalities onstituen-

ies may for some time stik to moderate redistribution typial for earlier

periods, in soieties where stark inequalities exist it may hardly be expeted

that inome equalization should lead to derease in atual demand for re-

distribution.

Abstract

In this paper, we empirically investigate correlations among four centrality measures, originated

from the social science, of various complex networks. For each network, we compute the cen-

trality measures, from which the partial correlation as well as the correlation coeﬃcient among

measures is estimated. We uncover that the degree and the betweenness centrality are highly cor-

related; furthermore, the betweenness follows a power-law distribution irrespective of the type of

networks. This characteristic is further examined in terms of the conditional probability distribu-

tion of the betweenness, given the degree. The conditional distribution also exhibits a power-law

behavior independent of the degree which explains partially, if not whole, the origin of the power-

law distribution of the betweenness. A similar analysis on the random network reveals that these

characteristics are not found in the random network.

INTRODUCTION

The network (or graph) is a useful way of expressing and investigating quantitatively

the characteristics of complex systems in various disciplines. It consists of a set of vertices

representing entities, and edges associated with connections between vertices [1]. Numerous

complex systems can be and have been expressed in terms of networks, and they are often

classiﬁed by the research ﬁeld, such as social [2, 3], technological [4, 5], and biological

networks [6, 7], to name just a few.

Early researches on the network focused mainly on the regular and the random net-

works from which many mathematical results for general structural characteristics have

been extracted [8]. Recently, due to the availability of computers and the Internet, study

on large-scale statistical properties of complex networks has been possible.

It was found

that many complex networks had distinctive features in common, such as the power-law

distribution of the degree and the clique of the network, resulting in the scale-free [9] and

the small world networks [10]. These uncovered characteristics, which diﬀer from those of

the regular and random networks, was the trigger that brought about considerable advances

in the understanding of complex networks, including the development of numerous analysis

tools and devising more accurate topological models for the observed networks [1].

More recently, the research on complex networks drifts also toward the community struc-

ture of the networks. It has been shown that various complex networks can be organized in

terms of the community structure (or modularity), in which groups of vertices that are highly

interconnected have looser connections between them. The analysis of these structures has

been a topic of intensive investigation in conjunction with many practical relevance, such

as ﬁnding functional modules in biological networks [11, 12] and identifying communities in

the Web in order to construct, for instance, an eﬃcient search engine [13].

Various attempts have been made to ﬁnd or identify community structures in complex

networks [14]. Examples include the hierarchical clustering [15]; methods based on the edge

betweenness [16, 17], the edge-clustering via the degree [18], the information centrality [19],

and the eigenvector centrality [20]; the information-theoretic approach via the degree [21].

These methods are directly or indirectly related to the centrality measures. Considering that

resulting community structure depends on the choice of measures (including the centrality

measures) adopted in various schemes, it would be interesting to investigate any relation

2

among the centrality measures.

The centrality (or sociometric status) has been studied particularly in the social science

from the perspective of the social connectivity.

It is an incarnations of a concept that

describes vertices’ prominence and/or importance in terms of features of their network envi-

ronment [22]. It addresses an issue of which individuals are best connected to other or have

most inﬂuence. This relative importance was quantiﬁed by various measures, developed

mainly by researchers of the social networks [23]. Diﬀerent measures for the centrality have

been proposed in the social science. Among them, four centrality measures are commonly

used in the network analysis: the degree, the closeness, the betweenness, and the eigenvector

centrality [22, 23, 24].

In this paper, we empirically investigate correlations among the centrality measures in

complex networks to gain some insight into the potential role of the measures in analyzing

complex networks. We restrict our analysis to undirected networks, since some of centrality

measures, such as the eigenvector centrality, cannot be deﬁned unambiguously for directed

networks. We analyze the ﬁlm actor network, the scientiﬁc collaboration network, the neu-

ral network of Caenorhabditis elegans, the Internet of both the Autonomous System (AS)

and the router levels, and protein interaction networks. Analyzed organisms for protein

interaction networks are Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Escherichia coli, Caenorhabditis elegans,

Drosophila melanogaster, Helicobacter pylori, and Homo sapiens [25].

II. CENTRALITY MEASURES

The centrality measures are introduced as a way of specifying and quantifying the cen-

trality concept of a vertex in a network. Furthermore, they are often classiﬁed according

to the extent to which a vertex has inﬂuence on the others: the immediate eﬀects, the

mediative eﬀects, and the total eﬀects centrality [22]. Typical examples which belong to

each class are: the closeness and degree for the immediate; the betweenness for the media-

tive; the eigenvector for the total eﬀect centrality. In addition, these measures are argued

to be complementary rather than competitive because they stem from the same theoreti-

cal foundation [22]. Although the measures are well known, we restate them here for the

completeness with the emphasis on their implications.

The degree centrality is the most basic of all measures which counts how many vertices

3

are involved in an interaction. It is deﬁned, for a vertex i, as the number of edges that the

vertex has. That is,

n

di =

aij ,

(1)

j=1
X
where n is the number of vertices in the network, and aij = 1 if vertices i and j are connected

by an edge, aij = 0 otherwise. It measures the opportunity to receive information ﬂowing

through the network with everything else being equal. The degree is also a prominent

quantity whose distribution follows a power-law distribution in scale-free networks [9].

The eigenvector centrality can be understood as a reﬁned version of the degree centrality

in the sense that it recursively takes into account how neighbor vertices are connected. That

is, the eigenvector centrality ei of a vertex i is proportional to the sum of the eigenvector

centrality of the vertices it is connected to. It is deﬁned as

ei = λ−1

aij ej ,

(2)

j
X
where λ is the largest eigenvalue to assure the centrality is non-negative. Thus, ei is the ith

component of the eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue λ of the network. While

the eigenvector centrality of a network can be calculated via the standard method [26] using

the adjacent matrix representation of the network, it can be also computed by an iterative

degree calculation, known as the accelerated power method [27]. This method is not only

more eﬃcient, but consistent with the spirit of the reﬁned version of the degree centrality.

The closeness centrality stems from the notion that the inﬂuence of central vertices

spreads more rapidly throughout a network than that of peripheral ones.

It is deﬁned,

for each vertex i, as

−1

,

dij

!

ci =

 

j
X

(3)

where dij is the length of the shortest path (geodesic) connecting vertices i and j. Thus,

the closeness is closely associated with the characteristic path length [10], the average path

length of all paths between all pairs of vertices.

The betweenness centrality, or the load [28], is a measure of the inﬂuence of a vertex over

the ﬂow of information between every pair of vertices under the assumption that information

primarily ﬂows over the shortest path between them. It measures the accumulated number

of information transmissions that occur through the pass. The removal of high betweenness

4

vertices sometimes results in disconnecting a network. The betweenness centrality of a vertex

i is deﬁned as

bi =

n

gjk(i)
gjk

,

(4)

Xjk
where gjk is the number of geodesics between j and k, and gjk(i) is the number of geodesics
(n2), in this paper, we normalize bi

that pass through i among gjk. Since bi is of the order

III. CORRELATION ANALYSIS

A. Correlation coeﬃcients and partial correlations

For every network, we compute the four centrality measures so that all four values are

assigned to each vertex. The correlation between a pair of diﬀerent measures can be esti-

mated by the correlation coeﬃcient [29]. More speciﬁcally, it is a quantity which measures

the linear correlation between vertex-wise pairs of data, (A, B) =

(ai, bi), i = 1, 2,

{

and is given as

,

, n
}

· · ·

(5)

RAB =

ai −

¯A
n σA σB
(cid:1) (cid:0)

bi −

¯B

,

(cid:1)

P (cid:0)

where ¯A and σA are the mean and standard deviation of the measurements of a centrality

measure A. The value of RAB ranges from -1 to 1: 1 being totally correlated, and -1 being

totally anti-correlated.

Table I shows correlation coeﬃcients estimated between pairs of data obtained from

diﬀerent centrality measures. As shown in Table I, the degree is strongly correlated with

the betweenness and less strongly with the eigenvector centrality; whereas the closeness

is weakly correlated with the other measures. This implies that the three measures (the

degree, the betweenness, the eigenvector centrality) are closely inter-related.

In general,

correlation coeﬃcients estimated from diﬀerent variables could be signiﬁcantly overlapped.

That is, a certain amount of correlation found between any two measures may be tied in

with correlations with the third.

To take into account this point, we introduce the partial correlation method [30]. The

partial correlation is a method that determines the correlation between any two variables

under the assumption that each of them is not correlated with the third. That is, it estimates

the correlation between two variables while the third variable is held constant. Formally,

5

the partial correlation between variables A and B while holding C constant is given in terms

of the corresponding correlation coeﬃcients as

RAB·C =

RAB −

−

(6)

We estimate all possible partial correlations for each correlation coeﬃcient, and results are

p

shown in the parentheses of Table I.

From Table I, we ﬁnd that the partial correlation between the degree and the between-

ness, while holding either the eigenvector or the closeness constant, diﬀers little from the

correlation coeﬃcient between them. This implies that the strong correlation between the

degree and the betweenness is solely due to the two measures by themselves, and little af-

fected by other measures. In contrast, the partial correlation between the betweenness and

the eigenvector (or the betweenness and the closeness) while holding the degree constant is

anti-correlated. This implies that the positive correlation between the betweenness and the

eigenvector (or the betweenness and the closeness) is almost entirely due to correlations with

the degree. That is, a positive correlation between them would change dramatically to a

negative correlation if they were not correlated with the degree centrality. Table I also shows

that the correlation between the degree and the eigenvector is aﬀected by the betweenness

and closeness.

B. Probability distribution of the betweenness

From the correlation analysis, we uncover that the degree and the betweenness are cor-

related much strongly than other centrality measures. This is, in a sense, expected since

vertices of a high degree would have better chance to be included in the shortest path along

a pair of vertices. To address the correlation between the degree k and the betweenness b,

we relate them, via the Bayes’ theorem, as

P (b) =

k) P (k) ,

P (b
|

Xk

(7)

and focus on the conditional probability distribution P (b
|

k) of b given k. To obtain reliable

statistics for the conditional distribution, we choose the ﬁlm actor network as an example

since it is composed of the largest number of vertices (over 370,000 vertices) in this study.

Figure 1(a) shows a few conditional probability distributions P (b

k). As shown in Fig. 1(a),

(11)

the conditional distribution approximately follows a power-law form with its exponent f (k)

depending on k, i.e.,

The k-dependent exponent f (k) can be estimated from diﬀerent degrees k. As Fig. 1(b)

suggests, f (k) depends roughly linearly on k. Thus, we have

Under the assumption that P (k) does not blow up as k increase, the dominant contribution of

the summation comes from small values of k. Thus, to the ﬁrst approximation, we ﬁnd that

the betweenness follows a power-law distribution, independent of the degree distribution.

expressed as

That is,

P (b)

∝

b−(α+β) ,

with α + β = 2.89 for the ﬁlm actor network.

The power-law distribution of the betweenness can also be obtained by the direct estimate

of the betweenness distribution. Figure 2 shows betweenness probability distributions of a

few networks. Scale-free networks, such as the ﬁlm actor and the protein interaction network

of D. melanogaster, have a power-law in the distribution of the betweenness which was ﬁrst

found in Ref. [28]. Considering that the degree is highly correlated with the betweenness, it

is not surprising that the betweenness of scale-free networks follows a power-law distribution.

From Fig. 2, we also ﬁnd that the directly estimated exponent 2.36 for the ﬁlm actor network

is close to the derived exponent of α + β = 2.89.

Moreover, Fig. 2 shows that the power-law distribution of the betweenness is not restricted

to the scale-free network, but held true to other types of networks, such as the collaboration

network and the neural network of C. elegans. Furthermore, as depicted in Fig. 3, the

conditional probability distribution of non scale-free networks, for instance, the collaboration

network, is also approximately a power-law distribution; furthermore, the exponent of the

distribution is insensitive to the degree k.

7

The power-law of the conditional probability distribution is less clear for networks of

small number of vertices. This is probably due to insuﬃcient number of data to obtain

reliable statistics. We, however, have seen the power-law of the conditional distribution

for networks composed of relatively suﬃcient number of vertices, irrespective of the type of

networks. From this, we may infer that it is the power-law of the conditional probability

distribution that is responsible for the power-law nature of the betweenness.

For a comparison, we apply the same analysis as above to the random network. Table

II shows correlation coeﬃcients and partial correlations between measures estimated for

the random network.

In contrast to the real networks, every centrality measure is very

strongly correlated with every other measures. This distinctive characteristic, however,

changes dramatically once we introduce the partial correlation. From partial correlation

estimates, we ﬁnd that correlation coeﬃcients between all possible pairs of measures, except

that between the degree and the betweenness, contain considerable amount of correlation

tied in with the other measures. Similar to the real networks, a strong correlation between

the degree and the betweenness is nearly maintained when these measures are assumed not

to be correlated with the other measures.

We also examine the conditional probability distribution of the betweenness given the

degree. A few conditional distributions P (b
|
are depicted in Fig. 4. Unlike complex networks, the distribution is not a power-law, but

k) of the betweenness b given the degree k

approximately a Gaussian irrespective of the degree. Since the conditional distribution of

the betweenness given the degree does not follow a power-law distribution, we expect that

the betweenness distribution of the random network may as well diﬀer from that of real

networks. As shown in Fig. 5, it turns out that the betweenness distribution for the random

network can be approximated as a log-normal distribution,

P (b) =

1
√2π σb

e−(ln b−µ)2/2σ2

,

(12)

where µ and σ are the scale and the shape parameters of the distribution, respectively.

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

In this paper, in order to investigate correlations among the measures, we applied four

centrality measures (the degree, the closeness, the betweenness, and the eigenvector central-

8

ity) to various types of complex networks as well as the random network. We found that the

degree was strongly correlated with the betweenness, and the correlation was robust in the

sense that the extent of correlation was little aﬀected by the presence of the other measures.

This ﬁnding was conﬁrmed by estimating the partial correlation between the degree and the

betweenness, while holding either the eigenvector or the closeness constant.

Based on the strong correlation existed between the two measures, we further uncovered

the characteristics of the betweenness. Not only for scale-free networks but for other types of

networks, the conditional distribution of the betweenness given the degree was approximately

a power-law which, in turn, played a predominant role in understanding the power-law

distribution of the betweenness. This feature was distinct from the random networks in

which the conditional distribution was roughly a Gaussian.

Within complex networks, the scale-free network by itself implies the existence of a hier-

archy with respect to the degree centrality [11, 31]. Similarly, the power-law distribution of

the betweenness may suggest a new potential role of the betweenness in quantifying the hi-

erarchy in conjunction with the community structure [14]. Therefore, it may provide us with

feasibility to use the betweenness and/or related quantities as a measure for constructing

hierarchical and community structures of complex networks.

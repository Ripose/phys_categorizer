PageRank, the prestige measure for Web pages used by Google, is the stationary probability of
a peculiar random walk on directed graphs, which interpolates between a pure random walk and a
process where all nodes have the same probability of being visited. We give some exact results on
the distribution of PageRank in the cases in which the damping factor q approaches the two limit
values 0 and 1. When q → 0 and for several classes of graphs the distribution is a power law with
exponent 2, regardless of the in-degree distribution. When q → 1 it can always be derived from the
in-degree distribution of the underlying graph, if the out-degree is the same for all nodes.

INTRODUCTION

Since the letter of Pearson [17], published on Nature
in 1905, random walk has become a central concept in
many branches of the physical sciences. The number of
applications and studies dedicated to the subject is in
fact so large that to give even a very partial list of refer-
ences is an overwhelming enterprise (see [12] for a recent
and fairly complete review). Most of the attention, so
far, has been devoted to the study of random walks and
related stochastic processes on d-dimensional euclidean
spaces and regular lattices, for their obvious relevance
to physical problems. To extend the deﬁnition of ran-
dom walk to an arbitrary graph is trivial, but its study
is relatively less developed. In this paper we address the
issue of the stationary probability of a random walk on
a directed scale-free graph.

The speciﬁc application we have in mind is the study of
Pagerank (PR), the prestige measure that the search en-
gine Google (and several other search engines) employs to
measure the prestige of Web pages. When a user submits
a query, the hits returned by Google are ranked accord-
ing to their PR values. As it will be clear in a moment,
such a measure is the stationary probability of a random
walk on the Web graph, where each node represents a
Web page and edges represent the hyperlinks (naturally
directed) connecting the pages.

Let us consider an arbitrary undirected graph and a
random walker moving on it. At any (discrete) time step
the walker jumps from the node where it is sitting on
to one of its neighbors chosen with equal probability. It
is trivial to show that, at stationarity, the probability
of each node to be visited is proportional to its degree,
i.e. the number of neighbors of the node. If the graph
is directed we have to distinguish (see Fig. (1)) the links
adjacent to a node in incoming (those that point to the
node) and outgoing (those that point away from it). If
the random walker is allowed to follow only the outgoing
links from the node where it presently is, the problem
of ﬁnding the stationary probability is far more compli-
cated. Such probability will in general depend on the

overall topological organization of the graph itself, and
cannot be expressed in terms of simple topological quan-
tities like the degree of a node. In fact, due to the direct-
edness of the links, the graph may have regions that the
walker can enter in but not escape from. The stationary
probability will be trivially concentrated in these regions.
In order to prevent this from happening we will consider
a modiﬁed (directed) random walker whose behavior is
deﬁned by the following two rules:

• with probability 1 − q the walker follows any out-

going link of i, chosen with equal probability;

• with probability q it moves to a generic node of the
network (including i), chosen with equal probabil-
ity.

This will suﬃce to ensure a non-zero stationary proba-
bility on every node. When considered in the context
of the Web graph, the process described above could
be thought as a rough modelization of a Web surfer
that occasionally (with probability q) decides to inter-
rupt his/her browsing and to restart it from a randomly
chosen page. The stationary probability of this process is
exactly PR. To adhere to the computer science terminol-
ogy, we will refer to the probability q as to the damping
factor. The damping factor adopted in real applications
is generally small (q ∼ 0.15).

A brave analogy with the undirected case could lead
to the hypothesis that PR is roughly proportional to the
in-degree of a node (number of incoming links), modulo
corrections due to the small damping factor. Such a view
could be further supported by the observation that the
distribution of PR for the real Web has a power law de-
cay [15] characterized by an exponent 2.1 (see Fig. (2)),
like the distribution of the in-degree [1] (note that, when
referring to the Web and unless otherwise speciﬁed, we
always assume a damping factor of q ∼ 0.15). A di-
rect measure of PR versus in-degree on two large sam-
ples of the Web graph is shown in Fig. (3), where the
value of PR has been averaged over nodes with the same
in-degree. The plot exhibits an almost linear behavior

with deviations at small degrees, when the eﬀect of the
damping factor is more relevant. Mean ﬁeld calculations
show that there is a positive correlation between PR and
in-degree [10] and a linear relation between in-degree and
the mean PR for nodes of equal in-degree can be safely as-
sumed if the degree correlations between adjacent nodes
are weak. On a generic directed graph, the linear re-
lationship between PR (even if considered on average)
and the in-degree is not granted and it depends on the
global organization of the graph itself. To address the
issue of PR distribution for an arbitrary graph and a
generic q would therefore require a case by case study.
In this paper, therefore, we concentrate on the two in-
teresting limits, i.e. q → 0 and q → 1, that show some
degree of universality. In these two limits it is possible to
derive analytical expressions for the distribution of PR.
For small q-values, a master equation approach allows
us to solve the problem for special classes of networks.

respondence between the distribution of PR and that of
in-degree, as long as the number of outgoing links from
each node (out-degree) is the same. Further, to have a
better control on the topological characteristics of the
graph and how they correlate with the PR distribution
we work with graphs generated by random processes or
processes of growth.

II. PAGERANK

Let us consider a generic directed network with n
nodes. Let p(i) be the PR of node i. The vector p satisﬁes
the following self-consistent system of relations:

p(i) =

+ (1 − q)

i = 1, 2, . . . , n (1)

q
n

p(j)
kout(j)

j:j→i
X

where j → i indicates a link from j to i and kout(j)
is the out-degree of node j. In the following we always
assume that each node has at least one outgoing link, and
therefore Eq. (1) is well deﬁned. To compute p amounts
to solve the eigenvalue problem for the transition matrix
M, whose element Mij is given by the expression:

Mij =

+ (1 − q)

q
n

1
kout(j)

Aji,

(2)

and where A is the adjacency matrix of the graph (Aji =
1 if there is a link from j to i, otherwise Aji = 0).

The stationary probability of the process described
by M is given by its principal eigenvector.
Its calcu-
lation is a standard problem of numerical analysis and
can be achieved by repeatedly applying the matrix M
to a generic vector p0 not orthogonal to p. It is easy to
show, in fact, that 1 = λ0 ≥ λ1 ≥ ... ≥ λn (λ’s being

the eigenvalues of M), and therefore liml→∞ Mlp0 = p.
In practical applications, it turns out that less than one
hundred iterations suﬃce to calculate the PR of a net-
work with 107 − 108 vertices.

PR, and therefore its distribution, depends on the
damping factor q in a non-trivial way. A ﬁrst rigorous
investigation of this problem was presented in [5] with fo-
cus on how the ranking of pages is inﬂuenced by changing
q and where some close expressions for derivatives of PR
with respect to q were derived. The damping factor can
be considered as an interpolation parameter between a
simple random walk and a pure scattering process. When
q = 0, the process reduces to a simple random walk, and
one may end up with a trivial invariant measure con-
centrated on a small subset of nodes. When q = 1, the
walker can jump to any node at each step, with proba-
bility 1/n. The PR of all nodes is then the same, and
equals 1/n, as one can see by setting q = 1 in Eq. (1).
The distribution of PR is therefore a Dirac δ function
centered at 1/n. For 0 < q < 1 the distribution is not
trivial, and in general it strongly depends on the under-
lying graph. On the other hand, in the two limits q → 0
and q → 1, Eq. (1) assumes forms which lend themselves
to simple analytical derivations and the PR distribution
can be exactly determined for a large set of graphs. It is
worth remarking that the limit of small q is the relevant
one for Web applications.

Eq. (3) reads:

where we have made the approximation 1 − q ∼ 1, which
corresponds to neglecting second-order terms in q, as the
terms of the sum are of order q/n. Even in the simpliﬁed
form of Eq. (3), our problem is not generally solvable,
but there are classes of networks for which analytical so-
lutions are possible. Among these, networks obtained
through a growth process are particularly important. Let
us label the nodes of the network 1, 2, ..., n. Further,
we assume that a generic link is directed from node i to
node j with i > j. Such a network can be thought as the
result of a process of growth if the label is interpreted
as the age of the nodes, where 1 corresponds to the old-
est. Links point from a new node (highest running label)
to older ones (smaller labels). Most traditional models
of network growth follow this prescription. In such net-
works, if an oriented path from node i to node j exists,
there is no path from j to i. In the following we also as-
sume that each node sets only a single link to older nodes
when it is created, i.e. each node has out-degree m = 1.
In this case there cannot be more than one path between

two nodes and the network is an oriented tree. This as-
sumption makes formal calculations easier, but it is not
diﬃcult to extend our proofs to the case when m > 1.

Under the assumption that nodes have out-degree 1,

meaning that the PR of a node is the sum of a constant
term (q/n) and the PR of its in-neighbors. In Fig. (4)
we show a subgraph of a tree. Node A is the root of
the subgraph. A random walker moving from any node
in the subtree and constrained by the directions of the
links will necessarily reach A. We call therefore the nodes
in the subtree predecessors of A (we include A among its
predecessors). The three empty circles are “leaves” of the
subgraph, as they have no incoming links. Starting from
the leaves, and using Eq. (4) recursively, it is possible to
calculate the PR of all nodes of the diagram. The values
are reported next to the nodes. The ﬁgure shows that

• all PR values are multiples of the elementary unit

q/n;

• PR increases if one moves from a node to another

by following a link;

If a new node N gives its link to any node of the

q/n.

• the PR of each node i, in units of q/n, equals the

number of its predecessors.

In the following PR is measured in units of q/n, and,
accordingly, the probability distribution is written as
PP R(l), with l = 1, 2, ..., n. When a new node N gets
connected to a generic node of the subgraph of Fig. (4),
the PR of node A increases by q/n. Further, all the
nodes on the path between N and A count N as a pre-
decessor and therefore they similarly increase their PR
by q/n (Fig. (5)).
In the next subsections we special-
ize the above to networks grown by a linear preferen-
tial attachment mechanism, either explicitly (Barab´asi-
Albert [3] and Dorogovtsev et al. [7]), or implicitly (Copy-
ing model [13]).

A. Explicit preferential attachment

In the model of Dorogovtsev et al. (DMS) [7], adapted
to a directed graph, the probability that a new node i

4

(5)

attaches its link to a node j (with in-degree kj) is

Π(kj , a) =

a + kj
i−1
l=1(a + kl)

P
i.e.
it only depends on the in-degree of the target node
and on a real constant a > 0. Eq. (5) is a generalization of
the linking probability of the Barab´asi and Albert (BA)
model [3], which is recovered when a coincides with the
(ﬁxed) out-degree m of the nodes (m = 1 in the present
case). The derivation below, therefore, encompasses the
BA model as a particular case.

n+1(l) to PP R

It is known that the DMS model leads to a scale-free
in-degree distribution with exponent γ = 2 + a. We start
from a network with n nodes. The probability distri-
n(l). In order to write a
bution of PR is, initially, PP R
n(l), one
master equation that relates PP R
notes that the addition of node n + 1 increases by q/n
the PR of all nodes in the path between n + 1 and 1,
while the others remain unaﬀected. In this way, among
the nodes of the path, PR l − 1 will become l, whereas
PR l will become l + 1. Let us consider a generic node
i with PR equal to l. The probability Πn
i that the new
link will change the PR of i from l to l + 1 is equal to the
probability that the link is received by any predecessor
of i (including i), i.e.

Πn

i =

j=>i
X

a + kj
n
t=1(a + kt)

(6)

P
where j => i indicates that j is a predecessor of i. Note
that even if other predecessors of i (besides i itself) in-
crease their PR due to the attachment of the new node,
they cannot reach the value l + 1, as their initial values
are necessarily smaller than l. Since all nodes have out-
degree m = 1, the total number of links of a network
with n nodes is n − 1 (we assume that the ﬁrst node does
not create links) and the denominator of Eq. (6) takes
the simple form

(a + kt) = an + n − 1 = (a + 1)n − 1.

(7)

n

t=1
X

The number of predecessors of i is l, and the total number
of adjacent links to the predecessors is l − 1 (see Fig. (4)).
One ﬁnally obtains:

Πn

i =

j=>i
X

a + kj
(a + 1)n − 1

=

(a + 1)l − 1
(a + 1)n − 1

.

(8)

The probability Πn(l) that the new link will alter the
value of any node in the “PR class” l is then:

Πn(l) = nP n

P R(l)Πn

i =

(a + 1)l − 1
(a + 1) − 1/n

P n

P R(l).

(9)

The master equation then reads:

(n + 1)P n+1

P R (l) − nP n

P R(l) = Πn(l − 1) − Πn(l).

(10)

The left-hand side of Eq. (10) expresses the variation
of the number of nodes in the “PR class” l, after the
addition of the (n + 1)th node. The right-hand side is the
diﬀerence between the probability of a shift of PR from
l−1 to l and the probability of a shift from l to l+1. Since
a single link is added at each iteration, only one node can
make either transition, and the diﬀerence in probability
coincides with the diﬀerence on the left-hand-side.

Note that Eq. (10) holds if l > 1. When l = 1, it must
be modiﬁed, because there are no nodes with zero PR
and the ﬁrst term on the right-hand-side would be ill-
deﬁned. The modiﬁcation, however, is simple. The new
node n+ 1 is a “leaf”, and it has PR 1. At each iteration,
therefore, the population of “PR class” 1 is increased by
one. We have

(n + 1)P n+1

P R (1) − nP n

P R(1) = 1 − Πn(1).

(11)

We are interested in the stationary solutions of Eqs. (10)
and (11), which can be derived by setting P n+1
P R (l) =
P n
P R(l) = PP R(l) (valid in the limit when n → ∞). In
this limit, one can safely neglect 1/n in Eq. (9). After
rearranging terms we obtain:

PP R(l) =

(a+1)l−a−2
(a+1)l+a PP R(l − 1),
a+1
2a+1 ,

(

if l > 1;
if l = 1.

(12)

which leads to:

PP R(l) =

a(a + 1)
[(a + 1)l + a][(a + 1)l − 1]

∼

1
l2 , for l ≫ 1.

(13)
The probability distribution of PR for a network built
according to the DMS model has a power law tail with
exponent β = 2, independently of a. Fig. (6) shows PR
distributions obtained from numerical simulations. They
refer to three DMS networks, with parameter a = 1/2, 3,
and 105, respectively. The number of nodes is n = 106
and q = 0.001. The tails of the three curves are straight
lines in the double-logarithmic scale of the plot, indicat-
ing a power law decay, and they are parallel. The contin-
uous line has the slope of the predicted trend, showing
an excellent agreement.

As noted above, our analytical result and the simu-
lation for a = 105 shows that β is independent of the
parameter a, surprisingly in contrast with what happens
for the in-degree, that, in the limit a → ∞, turns out to
have an exponential distribution. The networks whose
PR distributions are shown in the plot have been gener-
ated with m = 3. Fig. (6) then conﬁrms that our result
holds even when m > 1.

they know. In this framework, a newly created node i
is a copy of a randomly chosen existing node j. This
implies that i sets links to all the neighbors of j. Then,
with probability α, those links are rewired to other nodes,
again chosen at random. The model produces a scale-free
network with a power law in-degree distribution charac-
terized by an exponent γ = (2 − α)/(1 − α).

Although the linking mechanism is apparently unre-
lated to the degree of the target node, a closer inspection
reveals that the copying mechanism implies an eﬀective
linear preferential attachment [16]. To derive the PR dis-
tribution, we follow closely the strategy of the previous
subsection.

In order to aﬀect the PR of a node i, the link set by
the new node n + 1 must again attach to a predecessor of
i. It is useful to distinguish between the “copying” phase
and the “rewiring” phase of the linking process.

In the copying phase, to aﬀect the PR in i, the target
node has to be a predecessor of i, excluding i itself. After
the rewiring phase, the node i will avail itself of a new
contribution in PR if the new link is untouched by the
rewiring or rewired to another predecessor of i (this time
including i itself). Let’s assume that node i is originally
in “PR class” l. The probability to pick at random a
predecessor of i is l/n, if we include i, or (l − 1)/n, if we
exclude i. So, the probability Πn
i that the new link will
change the PR of i is:

Πn

i = (1 − α)

l − 1
n

+ α

=

l

l + α − 1

.

(14)

The α-dependent terms express the probability to have
copying (1 − α) and rewiring (α). From Eq. (14) one can
extend the result to all nodes with PR l, like in Eq. (9)

Πn(l) = nP n

P R(l)Πn

i = (l + α − 1)P n

P R(l).

(15)

Plugging the expression of Πn(l) in the balance equa-
tions (10) and (11), one obtains the following stationary

sion for the PR distribution follows

PP R(l) =

(17)

The result is analogous to the one obtained in the pre-
vious section. Since, as mentioned above, the linking
mechanism of the CM hides an eﬀective linear preferen-
tial attachment, the result is not totally unexpected.

A numerical test of the prediction in Eq. (17) can be
found in Fig. (7), where the PR distributions for three
networks built with the CM, with α equal to 0.1, 1/2 and
1, respectively, are shown. The other relevant parameters
are m = 3, n = 106 and q = 0.001. All the curves show
the same slope (with exponent 2) in a double-logarithmic
plot. Note that the CM with α = 1 generates a network
with an exponential in-degree distribution, analogously
to the DMS model in the limit a → ∞. Again, this fact
does not aﬀect the PR distribution.

C. Beyond preferential attachment

We have seen that the PR distribution for special net-
works has a power law tail with exponent 2, indepen-
dently of the in-degree distribution of the network, which
needs not even be a power law (e.g. DMS model for
a → ∞, CM for α → 1). This evidence, together with
the observation that the PR distribution for the real Web
(where a relatively small q is usually employed) has also
a power law distribution with exponent close to 2, may
erroneously lead to the conclusion that the above result
applies to a general graph

A numerical test on a random graph a la Erd¨os-
R´enyi [9] shows the limits of the validity of our result.
An Erd¨os-R´enyi graph is built starting from a set of n
nodes, and setting a link independently and with a proba-
bility r between any pair of nodes. The resulting network
has a Poissonian degree distribution, with mean rn. In
order to make the graph directed, we orient the link i − j
with equal probability from i to j or from j to i. There is
no “center” and no PR ﬂux towards a core of nodes, un-
like the networks we have studied above. All nodes will
thus have equal rights, and we expect little diﬀerences in
their PR values. Fig. (8) shows the PR distribution for
a random graph with 50000 nodes and r = 0.0002; the
damping factor q is 0.01. The distribution is clearly a
Poissonian, like that of in-degree.

It would be interesting to understand whether the re-
sult presented in this paper holds for all networks in
which random walkers stream towards a core of nodes.
We expect the PR distribution to be a power law quite
generally, but we have no arguments hinting to a univer-
sal occurrence of the exponent 2. Numerical evidences
suggest, in fact, that other exponents are possible.
In
Fig. (9) we show the small-q PR distribution for a citation
network of U.S. patents (q = 0.001). Citation networks
are practical examples of the directed trees we have an-
alyzed so far, as a new paper must necessarily cite older
papers. The data [11] refer to over 3 million U.S. patents
granted between January 1963 and December 1999, and
comprise all citations made to these patents between 1975
and 1999. The PR distribution is skewed, as expected,
but the slope of the tail is quite diﬀerent from 2, being
close to 3.

IV. THE LIMIT q → 1

When q = 1 all nodes have the same PR value 1/n.
In the following we study the limit q → 1 but q 6= 1. In
our Eq. (1), the constant q/n ∼ 1/n is now much larger
than the sum on the right-hand-side (we treat 1 − q as an
inﬁnitesimal). The PR distribution will then be very nar-
row and squeezed towards q/n, which is not interesting.
However, the sum over the neighbors in Eq. (1) deter-
mines the variable contribution to PR, which is respon-
sible for the diﬀerences in PR between the nodes. There-
fore, we isolate this piece, and call it reduced PageRank
(RPR). So, the RPR pr(i) of a node i is deﬁned as
q
n

pr(i) = p(i) −

i = 1, 2, . . . , n.

(18)

The RPR is the probability that, during the PR process,
a node is visited by a walker coming through any of its
incoming links. One can show that the distribution of
RPR coincides with the in-degree distribution on every
graph, provided the out-degree is a constant m. In this
case, in fact, when we replace PR with RPR through the
relation (18), Eq. (1) assumes the following form

pr(i) =

[pr(j) + q/n]

1 − q
m

j:j→i
X

=

q(1 − q)
mn

kin(i) +

1 − q
m

pr(j),

(19)

j:j→i
X

where kin(i) is the in-degree of i. From Eq. (20) it follows
that the RPR of a node is of order 1 − q. All terms
coming from the sum are of order (1 − q)2 and can be
safely neglected. Finally,

pr(i) ∼

kin(i),

i = 1, 2, . . . , n.

(20)

q(1 − q)
mn

The RPR of a node is then proportional to its in-degree,
and the corresponding distributions coincide, under no

assumptions other than the out-degree is a constant.
Therefore, the result has a wide generality.
It is also
intuitive how to extend it to the case in which the out-
degree is not constant but approximately the same for
all nodes. Out-degree distributions concentrated about
some value,
like Gaussians, Poissonians, exponentials,
etc., should not change the result.

Fig. (10) shows a test of Eq. (20). Each of the four plots
is a scatter plot relative to a diﬀerent network; three of
them are scale-free and one has an exponential in-degree
distribution (bottom right), as it has been generated with
a CM process for α = 1. The RPR of a generic node is
compared with the right-hand-side of Eq. (20). The con-
tinuous line represents the equality of the two variables.
The comparison with the data points is excellent in all
cases.

V. CONCLUSIONS

Since the birth of Google, PR has attracted a lot of
interest from the scientiﬁc community, but the deep rea-
sons behind its capacity to capture the “quality” better
than other and more used topological descriptors (e.g.
in-degree) are not yet clear. We studied PR in a more
general framework than its original ﬁeld of application
(the Web graph). We derived some exact results for
PR distributions in the limit when the damping factor
q approaches the two extreme values 0 and 1. When
q → 0, for networks without directed loops and where
walkers stream towards a central core of nodes (roots),
PR can be in principle calculated in a single sweep over
the nodes, starting from the leaves and converging shell-
wise towards the center. This feature allowed us to cal-

culate exactly the distribution of PR for networks built
according to some peculiar linking strategies, like that
of the DMS model (which includes the BA model as a
special case) and of the CM. In these cases, the PR dis-
tribution has a power law tail with exponent 2, for any
choice of the model parameters, that, on the contrary,
strongly aﬀect the in-degree distribution. This possibly
suggests that the PR process allows to diversify the roles
of the diﬀerent nodes much more than in-degree, and it
is a better criterion to rank nodes. Many networks have
the features that grant, on a ﬁrst approximation, the ap-
plicability of our results. Networks grown about one or
more centers, with new nodes pointing mostly to older
nodes belong to this class. The Web itself could be taken
as an example of this kind of networks. The PR distribu-
tion of the Web graph is usually calculated for q = 0.15,
which is quite close to zero, showing an exponent indeed
very close to 2 (see Fig. (2)). Work is in progress to de-
termine what are the broadest conditions that yield this
“universal” behavior.

In the limit q → 1, PR is a linear function of in-degree,
as long as the out-degree of the nodes is ﬁxed. The rela-

8

tion holds at the level of the single node, and not merely
in the statistical sense. We plan to investigate how gen-
eral this result is by relaxing the assumption of constant
out-degree and trying various distributions.

To summarize, the PR distribution strongly depends
on the value of the damping factor q, is in general “uncor-
related” from the corresponding in-degree distribution,
but depends on the overall topological organizaton of
the graph. This is not in contradiction with the ﬁnd-
ings of Ref. [10], where a correlation between the two
variables was observed, because the correlation involves
the in-degree and the mean PR-value of all nodes with
that in-degree. Within each in-degree class PR has large
ﬂuctuations.

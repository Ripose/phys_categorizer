Layered Complex Networks

Maciej Kurant and Patrick Thiran
EPFL, Switzerland

Many complex networks are only a part of larger systems, where a number of coexisting topologies
interact and depend on each other. We introduce a layered model to facilitate the description and
analysis of such systems. As an example of its application we study the load distribution in three
real-life transportation systems, where the lower layer is the physical infrastructure and the upper
layer represents the traﬃc ﬂows. This layered view allows us to capture the fundamental diﬀerences
between the real load and commonly used load estimators, which explains why these estimators fail
to approximate the real load.

The topologies of the Internet at the IP layer [1], of
the World Wide Web [2] or the networks formed by Peer
To Peer (P2P) applications [3] have recently drawn a lot
of attention. These graphs have been studied separately,
as distinct objects. However, they are closely related:
each WWW or P2P link virtually connects two IP nodes.
These two IP nodes are usually distant in the underly-
ing IP topology and the virtual connection is realized as
a path found by IP routers. In other words, the graph
formed by an application is mapped on the underlying IP
network. Although the topologies at both layers might
share a number of statistical properties (such as a heavy-
tailed degree distribution), they are very diﬀerent.
There exist layers also under the IP layer; even in a sim-
pliﬁed view of the Internet we must distinguish at least
one - the physical layer. It consists of a mesh of opti-
cal ﬁbers that are usually put in the ground along roads,
rails, or power-lines. This results in topologies very dif-
ferent from those observed at the IP layer. A mapping
of the IP graph onto the physical layer must satisfy a
number of constraints (see e.g., [4]).

Another important class of real-life systems is trans-
portation networks. The graphs based on the physical
infrastructure of such networks were analyzed on the ex-
amples of a power grid [5, 6], railway network [7], road
networks [8, 9], or urban mass transportation systems
[10, 11, 12, 13]. Although this approach often gives a
valuable insight into the studied topology, it ignores the
real-life traﬃc pattern and hence captures only a part
of the full picture. Interestingly, the networks of traﬃc
ﬂows were studied separately, for instance the ﬂows of
people within a city [14], and commuting traﬃc ﬂows be-
tween diﬀerent cities [15]. These studies, in turn, neglect
the underlying physical topology. A comprehensive view
of the system requires to analyze both layers (physical
and traﬃc) together. Of course, a partial knowledge of
the traﬃc pattern could be introduced into the physical
graph by assigning weights reﬂecting the amount of car-
ried traﬃc to the physical edges. This describes well a
speciﬁc type of transportation network, where all traﬃc
ﬂows are one-hop long and where the two layers actually
coincide, such as airport networks [16, 17]. However, in
the presence of longer (than one hop) traﬃc ﬂows, the

weighted physical graph is not suﬃcient. For instance,
the failure of a single physical node/edge should aﬀect
(delete or cause to reroute) all traﬃc ﬂows using this
edge/node, which requires the knowledge of the traﬃc
graph and of the actual routes of these ﬂows in the phys-
ical graph.

Coexisting and dependent graphs can also be observed
in social networks [18], where the same set of nodes may
be connected in various ways, depending on the type of
relationship chosen to be represented by edges. These
graphs are related to each other. It is common, for in-
stance, to establish a new link in a business relationship
graph (e.g., to ﬁnd a job) by performing a search in our
acquaintanceship network (i.e., by asking our friends who
ask their friends, etc) [19]. This new direct business link
translates into a path in the acquaintanceship network.
The above examples call for the introduction of addi-
tional layers to the description of some complex systems.
Therefore we propose a general multi-layered model. We
explain it on the example of two layers; all the deﬁnitions
naturally extend to any number of layers. In the two-
layered model, the lower-layer topology is called physical
graph Gφ = (V φ, Eφ), and the upper-layer topology is
called logical graph Gλ = (V λ, Eλ). We assume that the
sets of nodes at both layers are identical, i.e., V φ
V λ,
but as a general rule we keep the indexes φ and λ to make
the description unambiguous. Let N be the number of
nodes, N =
. The physical and logical graphs
|
can be directed or undirected, depending on the applica-
tion. The nodes and edges can have weights assigned to
them and denoted by w(
), with w = 1 for unweighted
·
graphs. Every logical edge eλ = (uλ, vλ) is mapped on
the physical graph as a path M (eλ)
Gφ connecting the
nodes uφ and vφ, corresponding to uλ and vλ. (A path is
deﬁned by the sequence of nodes it traverses.) The set of
paths corresponding to all logical edges is called mapping
M (Eλ) of the logical topology on the physical topology.
Now, the load l of a node vφ is the sum of the weights of
all logical edges whose paths traverse vφ:

Here, we apply this two-layered framework to study
transportation networks. The undirected, unweighted
physical graph Gφ will henceforth capture the physical
infrastructure of a transportation network, and the logi-
cal graph Gλ will reﬂect the undirected traﬃc ﬂows. All
data studied in this paper is extracted from timetables
of public transportation systems. First, we take a list of
all of trains, metros and buses departing in the system
within one weekday (time-span of 24 hours). A timetable
gives the exact route of each vehicle, which translates di-
rectly into a logical edge eλ (connecting the ﬁrst and the
last station) and its mapping M (eλ). The number of ve-
hicles following the same path in both possible directions
deﬁnes the ﬂow intensity - the weight w(eλ) of the logi-
cal link. (In this context, the logical graph is equivalent
to a traﬃc matrix in transportation science [20].) We
describe the algorithm to extract the two layers and the
mapping from timetables in [21].

We study three examples of transportation networks,
with sizes ranging from city to continent. As an example
of a city, we take the mass transportation system (buses,
trams and metros) of Warsaw (WA), Poland. At a coun-
try level, we study the railway network of Switzerland

(CH). Finally we investigate the railway network formed
by major trains and stations in most countries of central
Europe (EU). The basic characteristics of these networks
can be found in Table I and in Fig. 2. All physical topolo-
gies are connected, planar or close to planar, with the
diameter dφ in the order of O(√N ) (the diameter of a
graph is the length of the longest of all possible shortest
paths), and node degree distributions decaying exponen-
tially (the degree of a node is the number of edges inci-
dent on this node). These features are common to many
physical transportation graphs, such as a road network
or a railway system. The logical graphs are strikingly dif-
ferent. They are sparse and have multiple components,
among which many isolated nodes. The degree distri-
butions of the logical graphs are right-skewed, meaning

FIG. 3: EU dataset (WA and CH yield similar results). The ﬁrst three ﬁgures present the physical layout of the node degree
kφ (a), betweenness bφ (b) and real load l (c). The size of a node is proportional to the measured value. In (d) we present the
scatter-plots of the node degree kφ (top) and betweenness bφ (bottom) versus the real load l. In the top left corner of every
plot we give the value of the corresponding Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcient.

that there is a small number of nodes with very high de-
gree. This is conﬁrmed by the almost linear shape of the
distribution in the log-log scale plot shown in Fig. 2b; a
fully linear shape would indicate a power-law (a heavy-
tailed distribution). Similar right-skewed distributions
are observed for the weights of edges in the logical graphs
(Fig. 2c). In Fig. 2d, we compare the length distribution
of real traﬃc ﬂows with the length distribution of all-to-
all shortest paths. The former is very much left-skewed,
which means that the real ﬂows tend to be local.

Knowing the topologies and the mapping of both lay-
ers, we can easily compute the load of a node with for-
mula (1). For comparison purposes, we present below
two load estimators based exclusively on the physical
graph Gφ. For load estimators we take two metrics
known in social networks as centrality measures; they
are used to assess the importance of nodes. Our ﬁrst
metric is node degree kφ. It seems natural that the nodes
with a high degree carry more traﬃc than the less con-
nected nodes. Our second metric is betweenness bφ [22].
The betweenness of a vertex v is the fraction of shortest
paths between all pairs of vertices in a network, that
pass through v.
If there are more than one shortest
path between a given pair of vertices, then all such paths
are taken into account with equal weights summing to
one. Betweenness aims at capturing the amount of in-
formation passing through a vertex. Indeed, many au-
thors take betweenness as a measure of load either di-
rectly [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28], or with slight modiﬁca-
tions [6, 29, 30]

In Fig. 3 we compare the distribution of the real load
with its two estimators: node degree and betweenness.
The geographical patterns formed by the three metrics
diﬀer substantially (see Fig. 3abc). To quantify these dif-
ferences, in Fig. 3d we present the scatter plots of these
two estimators versus the real load l. The correlations
between them are very low, which is conﬁrmed by low
values of the corresponding Pearson’s coeﬃcients (top
left corner of every plot). For instance, for the value of

≃

102, the corresponding values of betweenness bφ
load l
cover more than two orders of magnitude. Surprisingly,
contrary to the commonly admitted view, the node de-
gree approximates the real load better than betweenness.

kφ and Gλ

Why do load estimators fail to mimic the real load pat-
tern? Are there some fundamental reasons behind this?
The layered view of the system is very helpful in answer-
ing these questions. First, observe that the ways we com-
pute node degree, betweenness and real load, can be uni-
ﬁed by recasting the ﬁrst two in the two-layered setting.
Indeed, both the node degree and the betweenness can
be computed as the node load (1) in two-layered systems
with speciﬁc logical topologies mapped on the physical
graph Gφ using shortest paths. We denote these speciﬁc
logical graphs by Gλ
bφ , for the node degree kφ
and the betweenness bφ, respectively. They are deﬁned
as follows.
In the case of the node degree, pick Gλ
kφ = Gφ: the log-
ical graph is identical to the physical graph Gφ. Hence
the mapping of Gλ
kφ on Gφ reduces trivially to single hop
traﬃc ﬂows, and (1) boils down to l(vφ) = kφ(vφ).
For the betweenness, Gλ
bφ is an unweighted and complete
(fully connected) graph.
Indeed, the deﬁnition of be-
tweenness requires to ﬁnd shortest paths between every
possible pair of vertices. Note that the mapping deﬁned
by betweenness splits the path (and its weight) if there
are more than one shortest path, whereas the shortest-
path mapping simply returns one of them. However, in
large graphs this diﬀerence is negligible, especially if the
shortest-path algorithm picks one of the possible paths
at random.
The same two-layered methodology can therefore be used
to compute node degree, betweenness and real
load.
Moreover,
in all three cases we use the same physi-
cal graph Gφ and a mapping that follows the short-
est path [33]. Consequently, all the diﬀerences between
the three metrics are completely captured by the logical
graphs Gλ
bφ and Gλ. We compare them in Table II.

The graph Gλ
kφ is moderately dense, planar, unweighted,
with the degree distribution decaying exponentially. The
edge length, counted in the number of hops in the map-
ping of this edge, is equal to one for all edges of Gλ
kφ. In
contrast, the graph Gλ
bφ is an unweighted and complete
graph, which means it is very dense, with every node of
degree equal to N
bφ we ﬁnd both short and long
edges; their distribution is bell-shaped, as shown by the
“all-to-all” curve in Fig. 2d. Finally, the real-life logical
graph Gλ is sparse, weighted and has rather local edges
(see the “real” curve in Fig. 2d). Moreover, the node de-
gree and edge weight distributions of Gλ are both very
much right-skewed.

There are thus a number of fundamental diﬀerences be-

kφ, Gλ

tween the three logical graphs Gλ
bφ and Gλ. They ex-
plain why the node degree and betweenness fail to mimic
the real load distribution. We expect to observe similar
diﬀerences in other ﬁelds. For instance, the logical graph
representing the traﬃc in the Internet shares many prop-
erties with the logical graphs of transportation systems
studied here. In particular, in the Internet, the distribu-
tion of intensity of traﬃc ﬂows (which is, in this paper,
equivalent to the edge weights in the logical graph) was
shown to be heavy-tailed [31, 32]. This is known in the
ﬁeld as “the elephants and mice phenomenon” [32], where
a small fraction of ﬂows is responsible for carrying most
of the traﬃc. Moreover, the number of ﬂows originating
from a given node (which is, in this paper, equivalent to
the node degree in the logical graph), was also shown to
follow a power-law distribution [31].

To summarize, we have introduced a framework for
studying complex systems in which we distinguish graphs
on two or more layers. We have shown on the example
of transportation networks how the layered view can fa-
cilitate the description, comparison and analysis of such
systems. Our work represents only a fraction of the possi-
bilities in this area. For example, the layered perspective
can completely change our view of the error and attack
tolerance of considered systems. It would be also inter-
esting to study how the properties of the topologies at
diﬀerent layers aﬀect the interactions between the layers.

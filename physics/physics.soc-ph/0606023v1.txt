Abstract

We investigate in detail a recent model of colliding mobile agents [Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 088702], used as an alternative approach
to construct evolving networks of interactions formed by the collisions governed by suitable dynamical rules. The system of
mobile agents evolves towards a quasi-stationary state which is, apart small ﬂuctuations, well characterized by the density of
the system and the residence time of the agents. The residence time deﬁnes a collision rate and by varying the collision rate,
the system percolates at a critical value, with the emergence of a giant cluster whose critical exponents are the ones of two-
dimensional percolation. Further, the degree and clustering coefﬁcient distributions and the average path length show that the
network associated with such a system presents non-trivial features which, depending on the collision rule, enables one not
only to recover the main properties of standard networks, such as exponential, random and scale-free networks, but also to
obtain other topological structures. Namely, we show a speciﬁc example where the obtained structure has topological features
which characterize accurately the structure and evolution of social networks in different contexts, ranging from networks of
acquaintances to networks of sexual contacts.

1. Introduction

Till recently, graph theory has been used as the frame-
work to study the dynamics and the topology of complex
systems, where elementary constituents are represented
by nodes and its interactions mapped to edges[1,2,3,4].
This approach enables the deﬁnition of statistical quan-
tities, such as the clustering coefﬁcient[5,6], the average
path length and the degree distributions[3], which char-
acterize the network structure and dynamics[2,4], be-
ing applied to study physical[7], biological[8,9,10] and
social[11,12,13] networks.

There are already many sets of real system data
where these quantities were measured, e.g. data of
virtual[14], social[15] and biological networks[16,17],

and also data of large infrastructure networks[18,19].
However, while for some of these real situations graph
theory describes the structure and the dynamical evo-
lution of the underlying system[1,2,3], there are other
situations where the standard approaches to construct
networks do not agree with the underlying structure
and dynamics[20,21,22]. A deeper understanding of
these latter situations could be improved by consider-
ing dynamical processes based on local information
which produce such networks [6,11,23,24,25].

To this end, we proposed recently[24,25] a model
where the nodes (agents) of the networks are mobile,
with the connections being deﬁned through their col-
lisions, i.e. being a consequence of their dynamics.
In other words, the network is build by keeping track
of the collisions between agents, representing the in-
teractions among them. Consequently, the network re-

sults directly from the time evolution of the system.
With this approach we are able[24] to reproduce the es-
sential features, namely the dynamical evolution, clus-
tering and community structure, observed in empiri-
cal networks of social contacts, and to explain associ-
ated deviations of networks where the contacts are of
a speciﬁc nature, e.g. sexual[24,25]. Social networks
have attracted signiﬁcant attention in the physics com-
munity [11,12,13,26,27,28], where, using approaches
and techniques from physical systems, gave further in-
sight to understand particular social behavior and related
phenomena, e.g. spread of epidemics [29,30], small-
world effects [5,11], the mechanisms of social network
growth [31] and cycles of acquaintances [6,32].

The main advantages of a model of mobile agents to
model structure and evolution of social acquaintances
comes from the fact that social interactions should be a
result not of an a priori knowledge about the network
structure but of local dynamics of the agents from which
the complex networks emerge. Since those social inter-
actions occur among individuals when they have close
afﬁnity or similar social features, it is understandable to
consider networks of social contacts as the result of col-
lisions among the agents moving in a continuous space
or a projection of it whose associated metric is related
to a social distance, deﬁned from the sociologic factors
promoting social contact.

The aim of the present paper is twofold. On one hand
it reviews the model in all its detail and discusses natu-
ral ways to extend it for speciﬁc purposes. On the other
hand it shows the features of the mobile agent model in
what concerns quasi-stationary regimes, critical behav-
ior and topological features. In Section 2 we describe
the model of mobile agents. The model attains a quasi-
stationary state which is fully characterized in Section
3 and in Section 4 its topological and statistical features
are presented. The system shows a percolation transi-
tion which is described in Section 5. Application of the
agent model to reproduce networks of social and sexual
contacts is presented in Section 6 and ﬁnally Section 7
discusses and concludes the main points throughout the
text.

2. Model of mobile agents with aging

In this Section we will show that the model of mobile
agents is parameterized by two single parameters, the
density ρ characterizing its composition and the maxi-
mal residence time Tℓ controlling its evolution. As we
will see, other quantities can be derived from these two
parameters for particular purposes, for instance to study

Edges between two agents indicate that they already collided with
each other: (a) Snapshot after the ﬁrst collision and (b-c) two
subsequent snapshots within one cluster of collisions. Filled nodes
(blue) and unﬁlled nodes (red) represent two different types of nodes,
e.g. males and females (see Sec. 6 for details).

the critical behavior of the system.

The system of mobile agents can be seen as a sort of
granular gas[33], composed by N particles with small
diameter d, representing agents randomly distributed in
√N d and
a two-dimensional system of linear size L
≫
with low density ρ = N/L2
1/d2. The mobile agents
represent individuals moving through the system and
each pair of agents may collide with each other, given
rise to a social contact between them. This social contact
is introduced by setting a link joining the two agents
after the collision, till its removal when one of the agents
leaves the system. Therefore, during the evolution of
the system, each agent i is characterized by its number
ki of links and by its age Ai.

≪

We consider periodic boundary conditions and when
initialized each agent has a randomly chosen position
and moving direction with velocity v0. When for the
ﬁrst time two agents collide, the corresponding collision
is taken as the ﬁrst contact in the network, as illustrated
in Fig. 1a (see arrow). Letting the agents move and
tracking their collisions through time, more and more
connections appear (Figs. 1b and 1c). Figure 1 shows
the evolution of only one part of the system. Typically,
several networks similar to the ones in Figs. 1b and
1c appear during the evolution, each one formed from
different single isolated collisions, as the one illustrated
in Fig. 1a.

The collision process is based on an event-driven al-
gorithm, i.e. the simulation progresses by means of a
time ordered sequence of collision events (diffusion)
and between collisions each agent follows a ballistic
trajectory[34] (drift). According to the algorithm, col-
lisions take place whenever the distance between the
centers of mass of two agents is equal to their diameter.
Since collisions represent social contacts their dy-
namical rules should fulﬁll some sociological require-
ments. Namely, it is known[35] that many social inter-
actions occur more commonly between individuals hav-
ing already a large number of previous contacts. For in-

stance, in sexual contacts[25] individuals with a larger
number of partners are more likely to get new partners.
Therefore, we choose a collision rule where the veloc-
ity of each agent may increase with the number k of
previous contacts, namely

v(ki) = (¯vkα

i + v0)ω,

(1)

where ki is the total number of social contacts of agent i,
¯v = 1 m/s is a constant to assure dimensions of velocity,
ω = (ex cos θ + ey sin θ) with θ a random angle and
ex and ey are unit vectors.

v
|

The exponent α in Eq. (1) controls the velocity up-
date after each collision. For α = 0 the velocity of each
particle is constant in time, and consequently the kinetic
energy density E = 1
2 ρv2 of the system is constant.
For α > 0 the velocity increases with degree k. In this
range, the value α = 1 (
k) marks a transition be-
| ∝
tween a sub-linear regime (α < 1) and a supra-linear
regime (α > 1) with different degree distributions[25].
Throughout the paper we will consider α = 1 in most
of the situations, showing that it produces the suitable
dynamics to reproduce real networks of social contacts.
It should be noticed that while positive values of α yield
dynamical laws which fulﬁll sociological requirements,
the equation of motion (1) is also able to consider com-
pletely different situations, where α < 0, i.e. where the
ability to acquire new contacts decreases with the num-
ber of previous contacts. In this manuscript, we will
focus in the regimes for α > 0.

As one may notice, contrary to collision inter-
actions where the velocity vector
is completely
deterministic[36], here momentum is not conserved.
This is a consequence not only of the increase of v
but also of the fact that after one collision the moving
direction is randomly selected. The main reason for
this random choice is that, as a ﬁrst approximation
it is plausible to assume that social contacts do not
determine which social contact will occur next.

Concerning the residence time or ‘age’ parameter A,

during which the agents remain in the system, if A

→
, each agent will eventually collide with all the other
∞
agents forming a fully connected network. Whereas,
when the average residence time of the agents is ﬁ-
nite the system will reach a non-trivial quasi-stationary
state[37,38], as described in the next Sec. 3.

The aging scheme considered here is simply param-
eterized by some threshold in the age of the agents.
More precisely, each agent i is initialized with a cer-
tain age Ai(0) which is a random number uniformly
distributed in the interval [0, Tℓ] with Tℓ being the max-
imal age an agent may have. Being updated according
to Ai(t + ∆t) = Ai(t) + ∆t, the age eventually reaches

3

Ai(t) = Tℓ, when the agent i leaves the system, yield-
Ai(0). Computationally
ing a total residence time Tℓ −
the replacement of an old agent by a new one is carried
out simply by removing all the connections of the old
agent and updating its velocity to the initial value v0
with a new random direction.

When the average residence time is too small, two
agents will have no time to collide at least once, and con-
sequently no network is formed. On the contrary, when
Tℓ is too large, each agent will cross the entire system
and a fully connected network appears. To avoid these
two extreme regimes we consider an average residence
time which is neither very small nor large when com-
pared with the characteristic time τ between collisions.
For that, we deﬁne a collision rate, as the fraction
= Tℓ/2,
between the average residence time Tℓ−h
where
is the average of x over different snapshots
in the quasi-stationary state, and the characteristic time
τ of the mean free path deﬁned as

where τ0 is the characteristic time of the system at the
beginning when all agents have velocity v0.

Before proceeding in characterizing the behavior of
such a system it is important to address three last points
to understand the parallel between the model and real
systems. First, the two-dimensional continuous space
where nodes move is not the physical space where in-
dividuals travel, meet or establish social acquaintances.
Instead, it represents a projection of a highly dimen-
sional Euclidean space whose metric is related to what
is called the social distance[12,39]: the closer two nodes
are, the similar their afﬁnities are (same tastes, same be-
havior, etc.) and therefore more probable to establish an
acquaintance, i.e. to collide. It should be stressed that
the metric is related to social distance, but also incorpo-
rates effects of random factors promoting two persons
to meet or establish friendship connections. We have no
rigorous explanation for the fact that a two-dimensional
projection of such a ‘large’-dimensional space sufﬁces
to reproduce empirical data of acquaintances. But the
fact is that it does, and therefore for simplicity we will
consider a two-dimensional system. One could also con-
sider higher dimensional systems of mobile agents but
then the ‘projected’ velocity in Eq.(1) would change.

Second, since the system of mobile agents is used to
extract a complex network, the two parameters of the

model inﬂuence the statistical features of the network
structure. Namely, increasing the density ρ conﬁnes the
accessible region of agents thus promoting the occur-
rence of collisions among them which are more con-
ﬁned in space. In other words, increasing the density
one increases the clustering coefﬁcient[5]. As for Tℓ,
the larger the residence time, the larger the number of
collisions an agent may have. Thus, increasing Tℓ in-
creases the average number

Finally, in a space of afﬁnities what is the meaning
of a velocity? The velocity is in fact a measure of the
accessible region of a given agent within this social
space which increases, decreases or remains constant
after each collision, depending on the value of α.

of connections.

In this Section we describe in detail the non-trivial
topological and dynamical properties of the quasi-
stationary (QS) state of the model described in the
previous section. As we will see, in the QS state the dy-
namical and topological quantities ﬂuctuate around an
average value after a transient time of the order of 2Tℓ.
Figure 2 illustrates the convergence toward the QS
state for two different values of Tℓ, namely for Tℓ =
30.75 and Tℓ = 75.34. Here, the convergence is char-
acterized by plotting the effective coordination given
by the fraction M/N between the total number M of
connections and the total number N of nodes (Fig. 2a),

above quantities increase in the earlier stages of the net-
work growth attaining a maximum value around t

Tℓ/2 where the agents start dying, resulting in the de-
crease of their values till a minimum at t = Tℓ. The
Tℓ/2 is due to the fact that the agents
maximum at t
have on average a life-time equal to Tℓ/2, while the min-
imum is due to the extinction of the ﬁrst ‘generation’ of
agents. Notice that, the maximum occurs at Tℓ/2 due to
the choice of the initial uniform distribution of the node
age which yields

The average values and corresponding ﬂuctuations of
these properties in the QS regime (t & 2Tℓ), depend on
Tℓ, i.e. on λ (see Eq. (3)). For large values of λ (large

be seen from the probability density functions (PDF)

In Fig. 5c we compute the degree distribution P (k),

Two different velocity updates are illustrated here,
namely α = 0 (triangles) and α = 1 (diamonds).
Clearly, the degree distribution depends strongly on the
collision update rule, i.e. on the value of α in Eq. (1).
More precisely, for α = 0, the velocity of each agent
is always constant, the resulting degree distribution be-

for α = 0 the system produces a two-dimensional geo-
metric random graph [40] in the QS state.

For α = 1 the velocity in Eq. (1) increases linearly
with the number of previous collisions. As we will see,
this kind of dynamics reveals to be most suited to repro-
duce the statistical features of real social networks (see
Sec. 6). In this case, the effective residence time is uni-

on the collision rate λ. Figure 6 shows the degree dis-
tribution in the QS state for λ = 5.24 (circles), 8.04
(squares), 13.04 (diamonds), 23.76 (up triangles) and
57.36 (left triangles), plotting with lines the exponential
in Eq. (5) evaluated with the corresponding
. As one
i
sees, while for small λ the exponential expression ﬁts
well the observed degree distributions, for larger
the
numerical results have a lower cutoff than the analyti-
cal expression. Therefore, one concludes that the agent
model is able to reproduce exponential distributions for
low values of the collision rate (λ < 10), and that other
non-trivial distributions appear increasing the collision
rate. The latest ones are the ones observed in empirical
social networks (see Sec. 6).

Another property of interest to characterize the net-
work is its clustering coefﬁcient. The local clustering
coefﬁcient Ci of a vertex i with degree ki measures
its cliquishness and is deﬁned as the quotient between
the number wi of triangles (cycles composed by three
edges) and the total number of triangles,

graphs, which have a clustering coefﬁcient independent

of k, here we observe a dependence of the form
with α
[0.4, 0.6]. In other words, Fig. (8) shows that
the clustering coefﬁcient decreases with the degree, a
feature which indicates the existence of an underlying
hierarchical structure[42].

To end this Section, we study two other topological
quantities, namely the average shortest path length ℓ and
the average clustering coefﬁcient C. As one knows [5],
knowing the values of these topological quantities one
is able to ascertain for small-world effects.

The average clustering coefﬁcient is deﬁned as the
average of the local clustering coefﬁcients Ci in Eq. (6)
for all i = 1, . . . , N , and the average shortest distance ℓ
is given by the average minimal number of edges joining
two randomly chosen nodes.

To investigate small-world effects in our system, we
compare the networks of the model of mobile agents
with random networks having the same number N of
nodes and where each pair of nodes is connected with a
probability p = 2M/(N (N
1)). With this probability
one obtains a random network with approximately the

In Fig. 9a, the average path length is small compared

world property[3] it is also required that the increase of
the shortest path length with the system size is not faster
than ln N . From Fig. 9a one sees that this is only true
for small system sizes (N < 104). For larger systems,
the ﬁtted numerical results yield ℓ = e−3√N .

In Fig. 9b one sees the behavior of the average cluster
coefﬁcient when the system size is increased. Interest-
ingly, one clearly sees an independence on N , beyond
N > 103, where C
0.08. For higher density values
ρ this N -independent value of C increases. This result
is quite in contrast to random graphs which scales with
1/N , as illustrated in Fig. 9b with triangles.

∼

Having characterized the features of the system be-
yond the transition at λc, where a giant cluster emerges,
in the next Section we focus on the properties of this
transition.

5. Critical behavior

The emergence of the giant cluster for an exponential
network has been studied by Molloy and Reed [43] or
equivalently using the generating function formalism
by Newman [44]. In both cases the transition belongs
to the universality class of mean ﬁeld percolation, in
contrast to the agents model which is in the universality
class of two-dimensional percolation, as we will show
in this Section.

The percolation transition is the abrupt change, at a
particular critical value λc, from a state composed by
several small clusters to a state where a giant cluster
dominates. A cluster is deﬁned as a group of connected
agents. Isolated agents are regarded as clusters of size

unity and any cluster consisting of s connected agents is
called an s-cluster. We borrow the notation from Stauf-
fer’s book on percolation theory [45] and deﬁne here
ns = Ns/N as the number of s-clusters per agent,
where Ns is the number of clusters of size s and N the
total number of agents in the system.

In Fig. 10 we show the time evolution of the size G
of the largest cluster (see also Fig. 4), together with the
total number P ns of clusters and the corresponding
size-averaged mean cluster size P s2ns. At the begin-
ning the size of the giant cluster and the size of the
mean cluster increase till t = Tℓ/2, corresponding to
a complementary decrease of the number of clusters.
Beyond this instant, agents which have an average res-
idence time of Tℓ/2, start to leave the system losing all
their connections, and therefore both the size of the gi-
ant cluster and the mean cluster size start to decrease
till t = Tℓ. Thereafter, all the ﬁrst generation of nodes
has left the system, and the evolution converges rapidly
to the QS state where all quantities present constant
values, apart small ﬂuctuations. For other values of Tℓ,
i.e. of the collision rate λ, one observes the same be-
havior of the above quantities, reaching the QS state at
different values.

The next step is to calculate for a given value of Tl,
the value of λ in the QS state and average at different
times the value of G. The result is plotted in Fig. 11a
for different system sizes. Simultaneously, the value of
χ, given by the size-averaged mean cluster size without
the largest cluster, is also calculated. The result is shown
in Fig. 12a.

In general, according to the standard scaling the-
ory [46], we expect G (Fig. 11a) and χ (Fig. 12a) to
follow

the phase transition belongs to the universality class of
percolation. It is known that the emergence of a giant
cluster for a random graph depends on
with its crit-
ical value at
ic = 1, and the phase transition belongs
in the same universality class as mean ﬁeld percola-
tion [47], whose exponents are given in the ﬁrst col-
umn of Tab. 1. However, for the agent model one ob-
serves the same emergence of the giant cluster at
ic =

2d-percolation, as shown in Tab. 1.

Before ending this Section, we stress that the corre-
lation exponent ν presented in Tab. 1 is obtained from
ﬁnite size scaling. This exponent can be also explicitly
calculated from the linear size of clusters (see [45]),
namely by computing the correlation length ξ(λ)
∼
−ν. The result is shown in Fig. 14, where the
λ
|
solid line has a slope of
1.3 yielding a correlation
−
exponent in agreement with the previous results (see
Tab. 1). Since the agents move on a two-dimensional
plane and have only a ﬁnite life time, they can only
establish connections within a restricted vicinity, and
this effect corresponds to a connectivity which is short
range. Thus, although the clusters in the agent model are
not quenched in time, the underlying dynamics yields a
short range 2d-percolation.

6. Real network of social interactions

In the previous Section we described the main char-
acteristics of the model of mobile agents in the QS
regime, namely an exponential degree distribution and
a transition to percolation for a certain critical collision
rate, beyond which no small-world effects are observed.
In this Section we analyze a real social network and
show that its topological features are well reproduced
by our model. In particular, we show that the statistical
features observed for the empirical networks are well
reproduced with parameter values beyond the transition
to percolation.

The empirical data comprehend an extensive study
done within the National Longitudinal Study of Ado-
lescent Health (AddHealth) [48] at the Carolina Popula-

sponded to it in a survey between 1994 and 1995. The

Figure 15 shows several plots of the degree distribu-

average degree found in real data. The agent model is
not only able to reproduce these degree distributions,
shown in Fig. 15, but also the corresponding clustering
coefﬁcient and the shortest path length.

In other words, a strong point of our model is that
since the average degree varies monotonically with λ
one can associate a particular value of the collision rate
to each school. The collision rate and in particular this
parameterization for the collision rate depends weakly
on the network size. Here we neglect this dependence, as
a ﬁrst approximation. Using this one-to-one correspon-
dence one is able to compare the topological quantities
between the schools and the model of mobile agents.

Notice that, the Add Health in-school friendship nom-
ination data was constructed from a questionnaire where
each student listed their in-school friends by order of
importance (best friend ﬁrst) and to each of the friends
they indicate which kinds of contacts they had in the
last seven days, out from ﬁve possible choices. Accord-
ing to the number of different kinds of acquaintances a
weight from 1 to 5 is attributed to each social contact.

Moreover, since the questionnaires are based on the in-
formation given by one agent, the networks are directed.
Here, we each social contact. Moreover we assume as a
ﬁrst approximation that social contacts are unweighted.
Using all the information concerning these empirical
networks [32] a more detailed study of the structure of
these networks will be presented elsewhere[49].

Finally, we stress that with a slight extension of the
model it is possible to reproduce subsets of social con-
nections, e.g. sexual contacts, having particular features
different from the entire network of all the acquain-
tances. For instance, in the case of sexual contacts the
degree distribution is commonly a power-law [21]. Fig-
ure 17 shows the degree distribution of a sexual contact
network (triangles) extracted from a tracing study for
HIV tests in Colorado Springs[50]. The dashed line in-
dicates the result obtained for a network of all social
contacts simulated with the agent model, while the solid
line is the degree distribution of a subset of contacts
from the social network.

The contacts in the subset are chosen by assigning
to each agent an intrinsic property, say a ﬁtness, which
enables one to select from all the social contacts the
ones of particular interest, in this case sexual contacts.
The ﬁtness is deﬁned by a given number and, when
two agents form a link, this link is marked as a ’sexual
contact’ if the sum of agents ﬁtnesses, ξi + ξj, is greater
than a given threshold. The initial distribution of the
ﬁtness is assigned to the agents following an exponential
distribution and the threshold is ln N/2, following the
scheme of intrinsic ﬁtness proposed in another context
by Caldarelli et. al. [51]. Interestingly, one is able to
extract from the typical distributions of social contacts
shown in this Section, which are not scale-free, power-
law distributions in QS state which resemble much the

ones observed in real networks of sexual contacts (see
also Ref. [25]).

7. Conclusions

In this paper we introduce an approach to construct
networks of complex interactions from a model of mo-
bile agents. The network is constructed by keeping track
of the collision between the mobile agents. Introducing
an aging scheme the network attains a QS regime, char-
acterized by almost constant topological and dynami-
cal quantities which ﬂuctuate slightly around an aver-
age value. Typically, the networks constructed with the
agent model, while having small path lengths and large
clustering coefﬁcients, do not show small-world effects,
since the average path length does not scale logarithmi-
cally with N .

The control parameters of the model are the density
of the agents and the maximal residence time the agents
may have. With these two parameters it is possible to
deﬁne a collision rate which, for a critical value, marks
a percolation transition whose exponents are the ones
of two-dimensional percolation. While for small colli-
sion rates, the degree distributions are approximately
exponential, for larger values of the collision rate they
strongly deviate from the exponential approximation
yielding a non-trivial degree distribution. Surprisingly,
these degree distributions are precisely the same as the
ones observed in real social networks of empirical data.
This empirical data has many other informations which
were not used in this study, namely the gender of the
agent and the ‘direction’ and ‘weight’ of the acquain-
tance. Therefore future investigations on the context of
network analysis of this recent empirical data could be
interesting for sociological purposes[49].

Moreover, we have shown that the agent model is also
able to reproduce networks having only social contacts
of particular nature, e.g. sexual contacts. In the partic-
ular case of sexual contacts it was found [21] that the
distribution of sexual partners has a power-law tail. The
dynamical reasons underlying this discrepancy between
the ‘total’ number of social contacts, with exponential
distributions, and the particular number of sexual con-
tacts, with power-law tails, is not yet explained.

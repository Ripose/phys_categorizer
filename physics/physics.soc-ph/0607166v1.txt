Abstract

Kelly criterion, that maximizes the expectation value of the logarithm of wealth for bookmaker

bets, gives an advantage over diﬀerent class of strategies. We use projective symmetries for a

explanation of this fact. Kelly’s approach allows for an interesting ﬁnancial interpretation of the

Boltzmann/Shannon entropy. A “no-go” hypothesis for big investors is suggested.

INTRODUCTION

When John L. Kelly was working for Bell Labs, he observed analogies between cal-

culation of the optimal player’s stake who enters into a gambling game and the eﬀective

transmission of information in a noisy communication channel. During the last half century

the strategy which was proposed by Kelly became very popular among gamblers and inspired

many authors of articles and books. The original paper dated from 1956 is hardly available.

Therefore, with the AT&T consent, it has been recently reproduced in LATEX. Today, strate-
gies based on Kelly criterion are successfully adopted in ﬁnancial markets, blackjack and

even horse races. The central problem for gamblers is to ﬁnd positive expectation bets. But

the gambler also needs to know how to manage his money, i.e. how much to bet. Application

of the Kelly criterion in blackjack was quite successful [7]. If all blackjack bets paid even

money, had positive expectation and were independent, the resulting Kelly betting recipe

when playing one hand at a time would be extremely simple: bet a fraction of your cur-

rent capital equal to your expectation. Does the Kelly criterion unambiguously specify the

winning strategy? In the thermodynamic limit the maximization of the expectation value

of logarithm of the proﬁt rate still leaves freedom of adopting diﬀerent strategies. Because

of calculational diﬃculties, only the limit case of extreme proﬁt can be given in a concise

analytical form. Kelly’s association suggests a method of describing eﬀectiveness of agents

investing in the ﬁnancial market in thermodynamical terms.

II. THE RULES OF THE GAME

Let us consider the simplest bookmakers bet. It can be described by disjoint alternative

of two events (the random events, the majority branches of events), which we denote 1 and
k (where k = 1, 2, and m ∈ N) is the fraction of current capital of

2. We assume that inm

m-th gambler, bet on event k, and

INk := X
m

inm

k > 0

(1)

describes the sum of wagers from all the gamblers of the bet. Accordingly, outm

k is the odds

paid for the m-th gambler on the occurrence of the k-th event.

The following conditions deﬁne our bet:

2

A) We shall consider the case of ”fair” odds (payoﬀ odds are calculated by sharing the pool

among all placed bets – the parimutuel betting), i.e.

∀k,m outm

k = αk inm
k ,

(2)

(3)

where αk ∈ R+.

out to the winners:

B) All fees and taxes are not taken into account which means that all the money is paid

IN1 + IN2 = X
m

outm

1 = X
m

outm
2

(it should be noted that the gamblers are placing their bets diﬀerently, it means that

the winners take all the pool).

The trade balance (3) is the natural premise. Let us observe that all costs and bookmaker’s

beneﬁt might be the fee for participation in the game. The winner carries out an analysis of

this cost after the winnings. The above condition A is equivalent to the statement that the

bookmaker bet is a good oﬀer on the eﬀective market without an opportunity of arbitrage

between the gamblers.

The conditions A and B describe uniquely the value of the factors αk, which can be

derived from formulas (1), (2) and (3). We have that:

∀k αk =

IN1 + IN2
INk

.

The formal description of the bookmaker bets with majority of branches of events might

be created hierarchically as the binary tree with the leafs – elementary events, e.g. by analogy

to the construction of tree-shaped key to compressing/decompressing Huﬀman code [2]. It

follows that our binary bet is universal , i.e. many kinds of ﬁnancial decisions we can describe

as the systems based on a hierarchy of formal binary bets. Within the analogical model for

insurance, the diﬀerences would only appear in the equation (4) of balanced beneﬁt. In this

case the balance (4) includes the possible loses which are relevant in insurances.

III. THE AVERAGE GAMBLER’S GAIN

We will omit the subscript m because we analyze the gain of a particular gambler. We

will use the following notation: all0 – the gambler’s capital before placing bets, accordingly

3

all1 – the gambler’s capital after result of 1, analogically all2 – after result of 2. The balance

of expense and gambler’s income is given by the formula:

allk = all0 − in1 − in2 + outk .

(4)

From the projective geometry point of view, where the assets exchange are described without

scale eﬀect in a natural way, the proﬁt (up to a multiplicative constant) is the unique additive

invariant of the group of homographies, which include all objective irrelevant transformation

between diﬀerent ways of mathematical modelling of the ﬁnancial eﬀect. When the k-th

event occurs the bookmaker bet, in this context, is represented by the following conﬁguration

of the straight lines [8]:

The straight lines u and w [9] express the proportion of an exchange (the market rate)

of the initial capital on the our ﬁnancial obligations and analogically the ﬁnal obligation,

respectively. The lines m and n denote the portfolio with ready money (before the closing

a business and after the settlement of accounts of the bets) and the portfolio which include

the bookmaker coupons (when the bet has been in eﬀect). The set of the projection points

{m, n} is the unique invariant of the game which is deﬁned by the gambler’s strategy. The

unique representation of the exchange of the bookmaker stakes u and w is possible only with

the accuracy of the homograpic transformation. Thus bookmaker stakes are the covariant

components of the model. They depend on choice of the basis of goods units (that means

4

the basis of vector space which is related to parametric portfolios – the projection points

of homogeneous coordinates). Thus the set {m, n}, often called as an absolute, allows one

to equip the projective space with the Hilbert metrics [1] and non-arbitrary measure of the

distance between two portfolios u and w given by this metrics. It represents the proﬁt ﬂow
in the transaction cycle m u

→ m. This proﬁt is equal to [4, 5]:

→ n w

zk := ln |[n, u, w, m]| = ln allk − ln all0 ,

where [n, w, u, m] is a cross ratio of the projective points n, u, w, and m. Let us denote the
percentage share of gambler’s capital in both cases of the bookie bets by lk := ink

all0 and let
pk be the probability of the k’th event. If |ink| ≤ INk then the gambler’s expected proﬁt is

equal to:

one:

E(zk)(l1, l2) := p1z1 + p2z2 = p1 ln(1 + IN2
IN1

l1 − l2) + p2 ln(1 + IN1
IN2

l2 − l1) .

(5)

IV. MAXIMAL EXPECTED GROWTH RATE OF WEALTH

The gambler bets the stakes ¯l1 and ¯l2 such that her/his expected proﬁt is the maximal

E(zk)(¯l1, ¯l2) := max
l1,l2

{E(z)(l1, l2)} .

By using the standard method we ﬁnd the extremum of the diﬀerentiable function and we
obtain that the family (¯l1, ¯l2) ∈ R2 of the strategies solutions of above problem is described

by the following straight line equation:

(¯l1 − p1) IN2 = (¯l2 − p2) IN1 ,

and the maximal proﬁt is given by:

E(zk)(¯l1, ¯l2) = − X

pk ln

INk

IN2+IN2 − S ,

k=1,2

(6)

(7)

where S = − Pk pk ln pk is Boltzmann/Shannon entropy. Thanks to this Eq. (7), we have
the ﬁnancial interpretation of Kelly’s formula. The maximal proﬁt given by Eq. (7) has

two components. The ﬁrst of these elements is the proﬁt on unpopularity of the winning
IN2+IN2 , and second means the (minus) entropy −S of
bet (the seer’s proﬁt) − Pk=1,2 pk ln
the branching. The value of E(z)(¯l1, ¯l2) is nonnegative – a rational gambler cannot loose.

INk

5

Thus her/his average proﬁt equals to 0 if the resultant preferences adopt to the probability

measurement to the branching: p1IN2 = p2IN1. Consequently, one can make proﬁt in the

bookie bet only when somebody bets irrationally in the same game.

V. THE OPTIMAL STRATEGY

Till this moment we have assumed that there is no any additional condition for the
simplest bookmaker bet, we allow the short position of the gamblers (negative value of ¯lk).

This is the reason why the rational gambler has the freedom of choosing the value of ﬁnancial
outlays ¯l1+ ¯l2 which is placed in bookmaker bets. In the absence of short positions (a typical
restriction on the bet l1, l2 ≥ 0) we assume that the rational gambler diversiﬁcates the risk in

such a way that she/he bets only the minimal part of their resources. From all the strategies

(6) we choose the optimal one:

1 = p1− IN1
(l∗

IN2

p2, l∗

2 = 0) ,

when p1IN2 > p2IN1, or, equivalently, the one that can be obtained by the transposition

1 ↔ 2 of the indices k.

If we do not have the information about proportion IN1

of Indiﬀerence (IN1 = IN2), and in this case (when p1 > p2) the optimal stakes are ((l∗
p1−p2, l∗

2 = 0), see [Kelly].

IN2 then we use Laplace’s Principle
1 =

VI. BIG GAMBLERS – “NO-GO” HYPOTHESIS

Let us now consider the variant of the binary bet when the gambler’s contribution of the

ink to the sum INk is not neglected. If the gambler pays to the pool, the pool of the bets
grows from IN1 + IN2 to (1 + δ)(IN1 + IN2), where δ ∈ R. Consequently the parts of the
pool corresponding to diﬀerent events are going to change from INk to INk + δ lk
l1+l2 (IN1 +
IN2).Then the part of the gambler’s expected proﬁt Eδ(z)(l1, l2) which is linear in δ will be

given by:

Eδ(z)(l1, l2) = p1 ln(1 +

l1 − l2) + p2 ln(1 +

l2 − l1) =

It is suﬃcient to restrict oneself to the case when δ is an inﬁnitely small number and then

we can consider the corrected parameters IN1 and IN2 (change of δ). The extremal strategy

is deﬁned by the set of equations:

∂(cid:0)E(z)(l1, l2) + ∂Eδ(z)(l1,l2)

∂δ

δ(cid:1)

(cid:12)
(cid:12)δ=0

= 0 .

∂lk

(9)

The solutions of these equations are the roots of two polynomials of degree ﬁve [10]. Accord-

ing to the fundamental theorem of Galois theory, we can conclude that an analytic form of

the conditions for the optimal big player’s strategy is not countable. We can ﬁnd the family
of parameters (¯l1, ¯l2) by using numerical methods, but we never can investigate the behavior

of characteristics of the rational big gamblers.

Due to the universality of the binary bet model, we can conclude that any type of anal-

ysis of big investors strategies, whose appearance will disturb the ﬁnancial market, will not

be satisfactory because of principal mathematical reasons. It is also possible that macroe-

conomic thermodynamics considered as the analysis of the market disturbing strategies is

forbidden by mathematics! In these contexts the tendency of diversiﬁcation in the invest-

ment might be perceived as an escape of the investors from the unsolvable problems.

Is it really true that Small Is Beautiful [11] also in the markets?

Abstract

In this paper we quantitatively investigate the statistical properties of a statistical ensemble

of stock prices. We focus attention on the real price deﬁned as s = s(t)/s(0) where s(0) is the

stock price for the initial time. We selected 3200 stocks traded in the Japanese Stock Exchange,

and formed a statistical ensemble of daily real prices for each trading day in the 3-years period

from January 4, 1999 to December 28, 2001, corresponding to the period of the internet Bubbles

and the bursts in the Japanese stock markets. We found that the tail of the complementary

cumulative distribution function of the ensemble of the real prices in the high value of the price
is well described by a power-law distribution, P (S > x) ∼ x−α, with an exponent that moves

over time. Furthermore we found that as the power-law exponents α approached two, the bubbles

collapsed. It seems reasonable to suppose that this is a indication of bursting bubbles.

INTRODUCTION

Despite moving from one century to the next numerous studies on bursting marketbub-

bles have been made by scholars, histrians, and policy makers [1-10]. Over a In the last

decades the stock markets has been frequently visited by large market crashes. The increas-

ingly frequent market crashes have attracted the attention of academics and policy makers.

Numerous reports, commentaries and academic books [1-8] have described the various rea-

sons why stock market crashes occurred. In the econophysisists’ community market crashes

have been a hottest issue [11-18]. One of the greatest myths is whether market crashes

are random, unpredictable events. Can be large market crashes forecasted? Do common

warning signs exist, which characterize the end of a bubble and the start of a market crash?

Our previous work [19] quantitatively investigated the statistical properties of an ensemble

of land prices in Japan in the 3-years period from January 4, 1999 to December 28, 2001,

corresponding to a period of the Japanfs internet bubble and the crashes to study on a

warning phenomenon of large market crashes. We selected approximately the 1200 large

stocks listed and traded in the Tokyo Stock Exchange during more than 20 years, and

formed ensembles of daily stock prices in the 3-year period. We found that the tail of the

complementary cumulative distribution function of the ensemble of stock prices in the high
value range is well described by a power-law distribution, P (S > x) ∼ x−α, with an exponent

that moves in the range of 1.09 < α < 1.27. Furthermore we found that as the power-law

exponents α approached unity, the internet bubbles collapsed. This suggests that Zipf’s law

for an ensemble of the stock prices is a sign of bursts of bubbles In [20] we also quantitatively

investigated the statistical properties of an ensemble of land prices in Japan in the 22-years

period from 1981 to 2002, corresponding to a period of the Japanfs bubble economy and

the crashes. We found the same laws as those on the Japanfs internet bubbles. Namely,

the tail of the complementary cumulative distribution function of the ensemble of the land
prices in the high price range is well described by a power-law distribution, P (S > x) ∼ x−α,

and furthermore that as the power-law exponents α approached unity, bubbles collapsed.

Our ﬁndings suggest that (i) bubble phenomenon is deﬁned as the abnormal enlargement of

price inequality which is caused by over-concentration of investment capital, and that (ii)

the stochastic dynamics of asset prices is non-stationary, and that (iii) the Zipf’s law for the

pricesf ensemble is an indication of bursts of bubbles.

The aim of this paper is to attempt to extend the observation on Japanfs internet bubbles.

In this paper we use the daily-price data of almost all stocks (about 3200 stocks) listed in

the stock exchanges in Japan in the 3-years period from January 4, 1999 to December 28,

2001, corresponding to a period of the Japanfs internet bubble and the crashes. We focus

attention on investigating the statistical properties of the real pricesf ensemble deﬁned below

rather than those of the pricesf ensemble.

II.

INTERNET BUBBLES

In the 1990s, the personal computer, software, telecommunications and internet were

rapidly gaining acceptance for business and personal use. The computer related technology

drives the powerful bull market trend of global markets. Several economists even postulated

that we were in a New Economy, where inﬂation was nonexistent and the stock market

crashes were obsolete. Investors over the world were euphoric and believed in the fallacy of

a perpetual bull market. Large scale stock speculation occurred causing a worldwide mania.

By the late 1990s, many technology companies were selling stock in initial public oﬀerings

(IPOs). Most initial shareholders, including employees, became millionaires overnight. By

early 2000, reality started to sink in. Investors soon realized that the dot-com dream was

really a bubble. Within months, the Nasdaq crashed from 5,000 to 2,000. In Japanfs stock

market many high-tech stocks which were worth billions, were oﬀ the map as quickly as they

appeared, too. Panic selling ensued as investors lost trillions of dollars. Yahoo Japan is a

typical example. The price of Yahoo Japan per share was about 25 thousand US dollar on

January 5, 1998. After two years, the stock price surged by 5,450 percent, and reached a

high of almost 1.5 million US dollar on February 23, 2000, and from then to December 30,

2002, the price declined to 15 thousand US dollar, a drop of about 99.1 percent. Numerous

accounting scandals came to light, showing how many companies artiﬁcially inﬂated earn-

ings. A lot of shareholders were crippled. Once again, we have seen the development of a

bubble and the inevitable stock market crash that always follows it [6-8].

Figure 2(a) and Figure 2(b) show respectively the movement of the mean and variance of

the stock pricesf ensemble distribution for each day in the three-year period from January

4, 1999 to December 28, 2001. Bursting internet bubbles is explicit in the movement of

the mean and variance. Both the mean and variance of stock price abnormally surged until

3

the middle of 2000. Both of the mean and variance peaked simultaneously on February

21, 2000, and began to drop rapidly. The reason why the abnormal enlargement of the

variance of stock price is probably that capital investment extremely concentrated on stocks

of industries which are related with the personal computer, software, telecommunications

and internet, so that the prices of a tiny number of the large high-tech stocks were surged

from the beginning of 2000. We can demonstrate this using the Gini coeﬃcient (G) [17],

known as the index for wealth concentration. The Gini coeﬃcient is deﬁned as

G = P

n
n
j=1 |Si − Sj|
i=1 P
2µn2

,

where n is the number of data and µ is equal to the mean of the pricesf ensemble. Theoret-

ically, the Gini coeﬃcient ranges from zero, when all land areas are equal in price, to unity,

when one land area has the highest price and the rest none. Figure 4(b) shows the movement

of the Gini coeﬃcient of the stock pricesf ensemble. The Gini coeﬃcient of the ensemble

of stock prices approach to unity on February 29, 2000, and price inequality reached the

breaking point[22].

III. EMPIRICAL LAWS FOR ENSEMBLES OF REAL PRICES

In this section we investigate the statistical properties of the ensemble of real prices in

order to study the statistical properties of cumulative price changes. The real price is deﬁned

as

X(t) =

S(t)
S(0)

Where S(0) is the stock price on the initial time t = 0, and is equal to the stock price on

January 4, 1999. Taking the logarithm of X(t), we obtain the cumulative returns

(1)

(2)

(3)

lnX(t) =

[lnS(i) − lnS(i − 1)].

t

X
i=1

Utilizing X(t) as an alternative to S(t), Every real prices X(0) for the initial time t = 0

is unity, so that the distribution of the real prices for the initial time t = 0 is the delta

function. Thus, we can investigate the statistical properties of cumulative price changes

without recourse to the price. Figure 3(a) shows the complementary cumulative distribution

of the real pricesf ensemble of 3500 companies listed into the Japanfs stock exchange on the

4

ten days that are selected randomly on the log-log scale. The tail of the complementary

cumulative distribution function of the real pricesf ensemble in the high price range is well

described by a power-law distribution,

P (X > x) ∼ x−α.

(4)

We use ordinary least squares (OLS) regression in log-log coordinates in order to determine

the exponent α. To conﬁrm the robustness of the above analysis, we repeated this analysis

for each of the trading days in a 3-years period from January 4, 1999, to December 28, 2001,

which corresponds to the periods of the Japanfs internet bubble and the collapses. They

are all consistent with a power-law asymptotic behavior. Figure 3(b) shows the movement

of the power-law exponent α in the period of the Japanfs internet bubbles. The exponent α

continued to decrease toward two during 1999, and the exponent α dipped below two from

17 February to 3 March, 2000, corresponding to the peak of bubbles and the onset time of

bursting in the Japanfs internet bubbles. Then the exponent α took oﬀ. On the other hand

Figure 4(b) shows the movement of the mean and variance of the stock pricesf ensemble

distribution for each day in the three-year period from January 4, 1999 to December 28,

2001. Bursting internet bubbles is explicit in the movement of the variance rather than the

movement of the mean. The variance of the real price abnormally surged until March 1, 2000

and then dropped sharply. This ﬁndings suggest that the threshold value of the exponent

α that cause bubbles to burst is two. We interpret it as follows. The mean and variance of

the power-law distribution (1) are written as

Mean =

; Variance =

1
α − 1

α2
(α − 1)2(α − 2)

.

Therefore, as the power-law exponent α approaches two, the variance diverges so that the

bubbles collapse inevitably.

IV. CONCLUDING REMARKS

In this paper we focus our attention on the statistical properties of ensembles of the real

prices. Using 3200 stocks traded in the Japanese Stock Exchange, we formed ensembles of

daily real prices X(t) in the period of the Japanfs internet bubble. We found that the tail

of the complementary cumulative distribution function of the ensemble in the high range

5

is well described by a power-law distribution, P (X > x) ∼ x−α, and when the power-law

exponent α approaches two, the bubbles of the real prices collapse. Thus, it is possible to

build up a hypothesis on bursting bubbles.

To date, no model so far has successfully explained the statistical properties of bursting

bubbles. Hence the next step is to model such behavior in stock markets. A promising idea

is to reproduce the statistical properties observed in the time evolution of ﬁnancial prices

by using the master equation or the Fokker-Plank equation[23]. This study will be left for

future work.

[22] If the distribution of the real pricesf ensemble follows the power law distribution, then the

Gini coeﬃcient can be written as G = 1/(2α − 1). Therefore, when the power-law exponent α

is equal to unity, the Gini coeﬃcient is also equal to unity.

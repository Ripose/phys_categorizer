Abstract

Quantum theory is used to model secondary ﬁnancial markets. Contrary
to stochastic descriptions, the formalism emphasizes the importance of
trading in determining the value of a security. A generic quantum me-
chanical construction is used for the temporal evolution of probabilities.
All possible realizations of investors holding securities and cash is taken
as the basis of the Hilbert space of market states. The temporal evo-
lution of an isolated market is unitary in this space. Linear operators
representing basic ﬁnancial transactions such as cash transfer and the
buying or selling of securities are constructed and simple model Hamil-
tonians that generate the temporal evolution due to cash ﬂows and the
trading of securities are proposed. The Hamiltonian describing ﬁnancial
transactions becomes local when the proﬁt/loss from trading is small
compared to the turnover. This approximation may describe a highly
liquid and eﬃcient stock market. The lognormal probability distribution
for the price of a stock with a variance that is proportional to the elapsed
time is reproduced for an equilibrium market. The volatility of a stock
in this case is related to the probability that it is traded.

1 Introduction

Modern quantitative ﬁnance is driven by stochastic models of market behavior.
In conjunction with arbitrage arguments these models have provided insights
into price relations1,2, notably between the prices of derivatives and their un-
derlying assets. However, the stochastic description all but ignores the cause
for market ﬂuctuations, which to a large extent arise because the price of
a security is newly negotiated every time it is traded3. Even rather sophis-
ticated stochastic models are designed to simulate the observed equilibrium
ﬂuctuations4,5. Possible coherent eﬀects from trading usually are not incor-
porated. The diﬃculties such models face in describing phenomena like those
occurring in a sell-oﬀ, can be traced to their implicit assumption that the trade
of a security does not alter the probability distribution for yet another trade.
That coherent eﬀects do exist becomes apparent when one tries to estimate
the probable wealth of a majority shareholder. At any given time, the average
worth of a security held by the majority investor generally may not even be

close to the average price found by trading small amounts of the security: an
attempt to trade a large portion of the majority holdings will almost invariably
change the average price of the security signiﬁcantly.

The following is an attempt to extend the probabilistic description of mar-
kets and include coherent phenomena. The approach is similar to that used for
unstable particles or atoms. Whereas the Poisson distribution for their decay
rate can be argued theoretically and was veriﬁed empirically, interpreting the
decay as a transition between quantum states was one of the ﬁrst successes of
quantum theory.

We will consider the trade of a security as the basic process that measures
its momentary price. The fact that such a measurement can only be performed
by changing the owner of the security ﬁts the Copenhagen characterization6 of
a quantum system rather well. According to this interpretation, the essence of
a quantum system is that a measurement alters its state by a ﬁnite amount.
At the quantum level, measurments may change the outcome of subsequent
measurements in a manner that is not described by ordinary probability theory.
In macroscopic systems the eﬀect of a measurement often is negligible, but by
explicitly describing the transition process, quantum theory also provides an
understanding of coherent collective eﬀects.

An outstanding example of a macroscopic manifestation of coherent quan-
tum eﬀects is the physical phenomenon which occurs in lasers. That some
materials under certain conditions emit light coherently can be understood
and becomes predictable only in the framework of quantum theory. The best
statistical description of the behavior of isolated atoms does not indicate under
what conditions a collection of like atoms will lase or not. Stimulated emission
is a quantum phenomenon. A similar ability of understanding and predicting
the conditions for collective ﬁnancial eﬀects is desirable.

Perhaps the best known quantum phenomena observed in physical sys-
tems are associated with interference. However, these are delicate eﬀects that
are best observed in relatively simple and controlled situations. Compelling
evidence for interference phenomena in ﬁnance is lacking, but this may be due
to the complexity of most ﬁnancial environments and the lack of controlled
experimentation that could uncover such eﬀects. It is well known that mar-
kets tend to be cyclical and would, left to themselves, exhibit a rather marked
temporal pattern, not entirely dissimilar to the beating that arises due to the
interference of coherent waves of similar frequency. Anti-cyclical monetary pol-
icy tends to reduce the violence and change the period of market variations,
but the admixture of appropriate components will similarly dampen the beats
of interfering waves. Some evidence for ﬁnancial interference is provided by
the technical analysis of stock prices and the observation of recurrent patterns

2

in large samples of historical data. Although the recognition of such patterns
is of little ﬁnancial value due to adjustments in the market that occur when
the pattern is exploited, the statistically signiﬁcant and recurrent existence of
any pattern before its recognition, could already be considered evidence for
wave-like ﬁnancial phenomena. The best indication for such eﬀects, if they ex-
ist, may come from ﬁnancial anomalies that for some reason or another cannot
proﬁtably be taken advantage of, perhaps because they are of very short or
extremely long duration. Transaction costs may also eliminate the proﬁtability
of some anomalies.

Although of great interest in the veriﬁcation of a quantum description,
empirical evidence of interference, diﬀraction and other wave phenomena in
ﬁnance will not be presented here. In a normal complex ﬁnancial environment
these eﬀects do not appear to be suﬃciently prominent to be easily recognized.
Without a fundamental model that predicts the recurrence of certain distinct
patterns, evidence obtained from a sophisticated statistical analysis of market
data at best can be circumstantial and probably is inconclusive. However, there
are theoretical arguments for the existence of periodic- and associated wave-
phenomena in ﬁnance. All economic developments after all occur within the
conﬁnes of the calendar. Agricultural commodities depend on seasonal eﬀects,
and the ﬁnancial reporting and taxation of most corporations is quarterly as
well. It is diﬃcult to imagine how such periodic pulses of information should
not give rise to periodic variations in cash ﬂows. The time required for the
dissemination of new information and for investors to act on it makes wave-like
propagation of at least some ﬁnancial variables likely. [A rudimentary form of
the superposition principle is that some of these cash- and disposition- waves
tend to have oﬀsetting or mutually enhancing eﬀects.]

However, the success of stochastic models demands that any other descrip-
tion of market phenomena must be capable of reproducing their results. The
question we will examine here is whether the temporal evolution of the proba-
bility distribution of simple stochastic models could be the result of a quantum
model. Under certain equilibrium conditions, the quantum model of ﬁnancial
markets developed below closely resembles a random walk. However, the quan-
tum interpretation is based on a detailed description of the trading process.
Microscopically, it is a time reversible model. The observed dissipation is due
to the large number of rather similar investors. A small and isolated market
with only a few participants would show a very diﬀerent and far more periodic
behavior.

In quantum theory, the constraints that the probability of any particular
outcome is non-negative at all times and that some outcome is certain are
in a sense trivialized. To illustrate this, consider a stochastic model for the

3

temporal evolution of the probabilities wi(t) for a discrete set of possible events
i = 0, 1, 2 . . . to occur at time t. The stochastic process has to ensure that,

wi(t)

i and

wi(t) = 1 ,

≥

at all times t. The temporal evolution of the probabilities wi(t) can, for in-
stance, be described by transition probabilities Pij(t′, t), that give the condi-
tional probability that the system will be in state i at time t′ > t, if it is in state
j at time t. Due to Eq. (1), these matrices do not form a group. In quantum
theory the probabilities are the squares of the moduli of complex amplitudes
Ai(t),

2,
Ai(t)
|
|
and the ﬁrst set of constraints in Eq. (1) is automatically satisﬁed for any choice
of amplitudes. That some outcome is certain requires that the amplitudes
satisfy,

wi(t) =

at all times. Eq. (3) states that the Ai lie on a (not necessarily ﬁnite dimen-
sional) hypersphere. The normalization condition in Eq. (3) does not depend
on time if the amplitudes at diﬀerent times are related by a (also not necessarily
ﬁnite dimensional) unitary matrix Uij(t′, t),

Ai(t′) =

Uij (t′, t)Aj (t), with

kj (t′, t) = δij .

Here ∗ denotes complex conjugation and Kronecker’s δij symbol stands for the
(ij)-entries of a unit matrix. Eq. (4) guarantees a probability interpretation if
the amplitudes are properly normalized at some particular time t0. The unitary
evolution matrices do form a group and Eq. (4) describes the evolution of the
amplitudes in quantum theory.

The relation Eq. (2) between the amplitudes Ai(t) and the probabilities
wi(t) is not one-to-one. Any two sets of amplitudes that diﬀer only in their
phases correspond to the same set of probabilities. Stationary probabilities
for instance are described by amplitudes whose phases can be functions of
time. Any conceivable temporal evolution of probabilities can be reproduced
by a temporal evolution of some corresponding set of amplitudes. However,
the converse statement that every unitary evolution of the amplitudes may be
reproduced by a stochastic process for the probabilities is not true7.

[Apart from actually observing interference, one could argue for the com-
plex amplitudes of a quantum description by counting the number of relevant

degrees of freedom of the transition-, respectively evolution- matrices. For a
ﬁnite probability space with N states, the constraints Eq. (1) imply that only
N 2
N parameters of the transition matrix Pij (t′, t) can be varied indepen-
N matrix depends on N 2 real parameters, N of which
dently. A unitary N
relate to the evolution of the N phases and are irrelevant for the probabilities.
Given the initial probabilities, respectively amplitudes at time t, the probabil-
ities at some time t′ > t thus depend continuously on N 2
N real parameters
in both descriptions. If the amplitudes were constrained to be real instead of
complex, the corresponding orthogonal evolution matrices would depend on
only (N 2
N )/2 parameters. The dimensionality of the parameter space in
this description would be smaller than that of the corresponding stochastic
model.]

Whether a quantum model encodes market mechanisms eﬃciently and is of
greater practical use than a stochastic model largely depends on the evolution
operator. The quantum models below are not meant to be overly realistic, but
perhaps reﬂect some generic aspects of quantum ﬁnance.

2 A Hilbert Space Representation of the Market

The market will be represented by a state in a Hilbert space
. A basis for
this Hilbert space are the pure states that reﬂect all in principle simultaneously
measurable quantities that describe the market. These states form a basis of
H
because an idealized measurement could in principle determine that the market
is represented by only one of these states and no other at a given moment in
time.

H

The basis states correspond to possible events of the probability theory.
Greatly simpliﬁed, the market consists of securities of types i = 1, 2 . . . , I,
and participants j = 1, . . . , J where I, J are integers (often rather large). In
addition, participant j has cash credit/debt xj. The latter may have been
loaned from or to other market participants or have been accumulated by
trading securities. A completely measurable basis for the Hilbert space of the
market in this case would be the collection of pure states

is the integer number of contracts of security i with a price of less than s

between s and s + ε dollars is a non-negative integer (for any ε > 0)a. The
N j
i (s) thus are non-negative, monotonic and piecewise constant functions with
integer steps. No a priori restrictions on the liquidity xj of each investor has
been imposed. One possibility of dynamically implementing such restrictions
is given in Section 4.1 .

In a market represented by a single basis state of Eq. (5) the worth of
every security and of every investor is known. This is the maximum amount
of information one can possibly have of the market at any moment in time. A
complete measurement of the market would entail that all market participants
disclose their cash possessions and trade all securities simultaneously, thus
ﬁxing the price of each single security. The worth and holdings in each security
of every investor at that point in time are then known with certainty and
the market is described by a single state of the basis
. Such a complete
measurement evidently is not practicable and our knowledge of the market
state in reality will never be so precise. Of importance here is only that a
complete measurement could in principle occur, and that one cannot have (or
does not wish to have) an even more accurate description of the market than
that provided by such an idealized measurement.

We deﬁne an isolated market as one in which no new types of securities
are issued nor old ones retracted and whose participants do not change. The
restriction is not as severe as may appear at ﬁrst. The time during which
market participants and securities do not change can be extended considerably
by allowing for artiﬁcial market participants and securities that do not trade.
The operator describing the issue of securities is given in Appendix A.

In an isolated market the Hilbert space itself does not depend on time. A

holds at all times. Eq. (9) is the analog of Eq. (3) for a set of probabilities that
is not necessarily discrete. The temporal evolution of any state that represents
an isolated market thus is given by a unitary transformation.

3 Basic Operations

Any trade is a partial measurement and restricts the market state at that
moment to a subspace of
. Successive trades generally will exclude a static,
time independent, market state. The market’s state thus evolves in time and
at least some of the amplitudes An of Eq. (7) will depend on time. However,
there is a unique pure state that does not evolve. In a market described by,

Note that the hermitian conjugate operator ˆcj(s) = ˆc†j(

holdings of participant j by s dollars. [Possible restrictions on the liquidity of
market participants are discussed in Section 4.1 .] The c†- and c- operators
commute with each other and satisfy the multiplication relation,

−

ˆc†j(s) ˆc†j (s′) = ˆc†j(s + s′), with ˆc†j (

s) = ˆcj(s) and ˆcj(0) = 1 .

Eq. (12) implies that,

[ˆc†j (s), ˆxk] = ˆc†j (s)ˆxk

ˆxkˆc†j(s) = δjk sˆc†j(s) ,

−
where ˆxj is the operator whose eigenvalue is the cash holdings of investor j.
The commutation relation Eq. (14) identiﬁes8 c†j(s) as a translation operator;
it translates the coordinate x to x + s.

(14)

We next deﬁne creation and annihilation operators for securities.

3.2 Creating and Destroying Securities

Since more than one security of type i held by investor j may have exactly
the same price (in the extreme, they may for instance all be worthless), the
buying and selling of securities is represented by bosonic creation and anni-
hilation operators. Let ˆaj
i (s) be the annihilation operator that removes one
security of type i for a price of s dollars from the portfolio of investor j and
let the hermitian conjugate operator ˆa†j
i (s) denote the corresponding creation
operator that adds such a security to j’s portfolio. [If a certain type of security,
such as common stock, is only traded in packages or contracts, the creation
and annihilation operators for that security refer to the smallest entity that is
traded, rather than the individual securities themselves.] The selling (buying)
price is included in the description, because this is a known characteristic of
the security, that could be (and often is) recorded at the time of purchase or
sale. Note that a security’s price changes with time and therefore is not a
conserved quantityc. Between trades, the price of a security in general will
not be known with certainty. The value of a security that is being held can

will see that ln(s) is analogous to a particle’s position.

8

only be estimated as the price one may expect to achieve when it is traded. It
will become apparent in section 4.2 that a security bought at a certain price
in time evolves into a superposition of states representing various prices, with
amplitudes that correspond to the probability that the security can be sold at
that price.

The price paid for a security and the diﬀerence to the price realized from
(instantly) selling it again is essential to any trade. From the point of view of
the investor two securities of the same type are not equivalent if they are sold
at diﬀerent prices. Depending on the market, it may be easier or more diﬃcult
to sell two securities of the same type at two diﬀerent prices, than to sell both
at the average price. Thus, although the overall return to the investor is the
same, the two sales are not equivalent from a dynamic point of view.

On the other hand, a serial number that distinguishes one security from
another of the same type is a ﬁnancially irrelevant property that does not aﬀect
any trade and that therefore will not be included in the characterization of the
securityd. The creation and annihilation operators for securities thus satisfy
the commutator algebra,

i (s), ˆa†k

(15)

The RHS of Eq. (15) is scale invariant. The reason for this perhaps slightly
unusual normalization of the creation and annihilation operators in Eq. (15)
will soon become apparent. Note that the creation and annihilation operators
so deﬁned are dimensionless and that worthless securities commute.

Since a security normally has to be paid for, buying a security is not quite
the same as simply acquiring one. Rather than the operators ˆa and ˆa†, it
therefore is convenient to consider the combinations,

(21)

that take the change in cash of investor j into account when he buys/sells
the security. Because cash changing operators are unitary, commute with the
creation and annihilation operators for securities and obey the multiplication
rule of Eq. (13), the composite ˆb-operators deﬁned in Eq. (21) satisfy similar
commutation relations as the ˆa and ˆa†’s among themselves. However, unlike
the ˆa’s they do not commute with the cash holding operators ˆx. The commu-
tation relations Eq. (15) and Eq. (14) together with the deﬁnitions in Eq. (21)
lead to the following commutation algebra for the ˆb’s,

[ˆbj
i (s), ˆb†k
l (s′)] = sδ(s

The latter two relations have the interpretation that an investor’s account is
credited (debited) by s dollars when a security is sold (bought) for that amount.

4 Temporal Market Evolution

We have so far constructed states that describe a market by the probabilities
that certain holdings in cash and securities are realizede. Of greater interest
eAs mentioned before, this representation is not unique, as the phases of the coeﬃcients Ai
in Eq. (7) are not determined by the probabilities.

The temporal evolution of all possible market states thus deﬁnes a linear oper-
ator on the Hilbert space. ˆU(t′, t) furthermore is unique if one properly deﬁnes
so that the kernel of ˆU(t′, t) is empty. Eq. (22) in this case uniquely asso-

market states
it give the same probability distributions at time t, it is pos-
sible to encode past evolution in the relative phases of the Ai. The evolution
in Eq. (22) is capable of encoding a non-Markovian temporal evolution of the
probabilities and even ”non-deterministic” evolutions that cannot be simulated
by a stochastic process7.

The probability interpretation of the expansion coeﬃcients in Eq. (7) to-

, then ˆU(t′, t)

ˆU −1(t′, t) = ˆU †(t′, t) = ˆU (t, t′) ; with ˆU(t, t) = 1 .

Eq. (22) implies that for any ε > 0,

ˆU(t′ + ε, t) = ˆU (t′ + ε, t′) ˆU (t′, t) .

If the unitary evolution operator ˆU (t′, t) is diﬀerentiable in the vicinity of
t′ = t one has an associated hermitian Hamiltonian, ˆH(t), that generates the
temporal evolution of the quantum system.

Eq. (28) implies a continuous evolution of the state with time. It is valid only
if the change in the state becomes arbitrarily small for t′

shall see, is not always true for ﬁnancial marketsf . By allowing for operators

time at time t is given by the action of

cash and/or securities. The Hamiltonian that generates the temporal evolution
thus represents ﬁnancial transactions. In a suﬃciently short time (t′

it is rather unlikely that more than one transaction occurs. To model the time
evolution Eq. (22) of the market state it thus may be suﬃcient to consider only
primitive transactions that can be viewed as occurring instantaneously.

4.1 Cash Flow

The cash ﬂows to and from an investor can be due to the buying and selling
of securities, income, consumption, or accrued interest in a money market ac-
count. The latter could in principle be modelled as arising due to investments.
Since income, consumption and earned interest to some extent may be known
in advance with very little uncertainty, it is of some practical and conceptual

f Below we obtain the change of the market state due to an instantaneous cash ﬂow –
inspection shows that it does not satisfy Eq. (28) because the state changes by a unitary
transformation that is discontinuous in time.

interest to answer the question whether deterministic changes in cash can be
reproduced by a quantum model and to obtain the Hamiltonian that represents
ﬁxed cash ﬂows.

To simplify, we rule out the possibility of default and ﬁrst consider a money
market account as a magical box in which the cash of market participant
j grows at a pre-known rate rj(t). The solution to the problem of ﬁnding
the associated quantum Hamiltonian hinges on a peculiarity of the classical
equation for the growth of j’s cash. Hamilton’s equations that describe the
classical time evolution of the cash are

4.2 Trading Securities

Let us for the moment ignore initial oﬀerings and repurchases and assume
that the number of securities of type i on the secondary market does not

in Appendix A.] Thus, if someone buys a security, someone has to sell the
same. The primitive transaction therefore is that trader l buys a security of
type i for s dollars from investor k and (immediately) sells it for s′ dollars
to investor j, crediting/debiting the cash diﬀerence s′
s to his own account.
Note that the trader could, but need not, be the seller or buyer of the security.

(38)

The amplitude f i

security i from investor k for s-dollars and sells it to investor j for s′-dollars. To
further constrain the amplitudes, one either requires empirical data on transac-
tion rates or additional assumptions or both. The following four assumptions
of decreasing generality are useful in constraining the amplitudes.

(A1) Invariance of the dynamics under global re-scaling of all prices. It as-
sumes that the market dynamics would be the same if all prices were
stated in Euros instead of dollars. The coeﬃcients in Eq. (37) in this
case are functions of s′/s only. Introducing,

(A2) If the market is eﬃcient, every participant may be expected to have
the same return. There should be no opportunities that can be better
exploited by one investor than by another. Although clearly an idealiza-
tion, it is widely believed that low-cost and high-speed electronic trading
together with readily accessible public information tends to improve mar-
ket eﬃciency. The expected wealth W
(t) of investor j at time t in the
present model is the expectation value of the operator,

(42)

The two contributions to the expected wealth of an investor are his ex-
pected cash- and security- wealth respectively. Since the operator ˆW j de-
ﬁned in Eq. (41) does not explicitly depend on time, the expected wealth
of an investor changes due to the temporal evolution of the market only.
Assuming that this evolution is suﬃciently smooth and using Eq. (28)
one obtains,

j

where ¯r(t) is the instantaneous expected return common to all investors.
If Eq. (44) is valid at some time t, ˆH(t) of an eﬃcient market must be
such that Eq. (44) continues to hold at later times. An evolution operator
ˆH(t) that is totally symmetric with respect to the interchange of investors
is suﬃcient to guarantee this. This idealization of perfect market democ-
racy assumes that every investor statistically behaves as any other under
the same ﬁnancial circumstances. This might not give a realistic descrip-
tion of a market in which individual and corporate investors have access
to diﬀerent ﬁnancial instruments, rates etc. However, to some extent
these diﬀerences could be due to the generally higher ﬁnancial prowess
of corporations rather than due to a lack of market democracy.

Assuming the existence of a typical investor often leads to similar sim-
pliﬁcations as the assumption of market democracy. Replacing a myriad
of individual investors by one (or a few) typical ones could result in a
statistically valid description even when there are gross (but suﬃciently
few) exceptions.

The stability of the market state under small perturbations away from an
eﬃcient one clearly is of some interest, since one would like to know the
conditions on ˆH(t) that ensure that an only marginally eﬃcient market
evolves toward a more eﬃcient one. Although this stability problem
will not be analyzed here, it is of interest to the following development
that there are non-trivial Hamiltonians ˆ¯H(t) that satisfy Eq. (44) in the

operator sense: the market in this case is eﬃcient for any state

even when ¯r(t)
= 0. Not so surprisingly, however, the investors do not
trade in this case [and the common rate of return ¯r(t) could only be due
to taxation and inﬂation].
Since ˆW j is linear in the creation and annihilation operators, a term in
ˆ¯H(t) either commutes with the ˆW j’s or is itself at most linear in the
creation and annihilation operators. Up to terms that commute with the
ˆW j’s, ˆ¯H(t) thus is of the form,

The price of a security changes due to the second term in H i

jk(s, t) that describes the interaction due to the
exchange of a security of type i at a price of s dollars between investors j

part of a conformal invariance. Possible relations between the present

One is always free to choose the ”investors” in security i in such a way
that Ai
.. is diagonal. This can be viewed as a way of deﬁning indepen-
dent investors in security i. In general such independent investors will be
linear combinations of the original investors, or for that matter, linear
combinations of the independent investors in another security i′
= i. An
independent investor in security i′ need not be independently investing
= i′. This can be due to common interests with other in-
in security i
vestors in security i that he does not share with regard to security i′. An
example are the employees of a company: their investment in securities
of their own company could be much more correlated than in securities
of other enterprises. Bound by agreements and managerial incentives,
employees in extreme cases may be acting as a single independent in-
vestor with regard to their own company, whereas they individually are
independent investors in other securities. The example also hints that
the basis of independent investors in a security may depend on time, since
some employees could leave and others join the company over time.

The information needed to determine the independent investors in secu-
rity i is encoded in the Ai
jk and it may seem senseless to diagonalize these
matrices. However, it very often is quite clear which investors are ap-
proximately independent and one can choose the basis accordingly from
the outset. Very helpful in this respect is that the diagonal coeﬃcients
jj (t) in ˆH of Eq. (58) can be interpreted as Lagrange multipliers for the
Ai
average total number of securities of type i held by investor j at time t.
One concludes that if the holdings of two investors in a security are un-
correlated in the absence of gain or loss, these investors can be considered
independent. Note that this does not imply that the investor’s holdings
are uncorrelated if a proﬁt or loss can be made by holding the security.
Investors in this sense are independent if they do not share any common
Independent in-
interests in a security other than its proﬁt potential.
vestors will not invest in a security due to their political convictions or
because their brother does.

(A4) In a basis of independent investors, the coeﬃcients Bi

are related to the probability of a cash ﬂow in the short time interval dt
due to the transfer of security i between (independent) investors j and

..;l(t) are well condi-
tioned and readily inverted numerically. Financially Eq. (59) says that
most of the security’s gain or loss in value occurs while an investor is
holding onto it. It precludes the possibility of a large cash ﬂow while the
security is transferred between investors. Eq. (59) is entirely consistent
with our previous assumption that the market allows only incremen-
tal trading proﬁts. The special non-trading case Bi
jk;l(t) = ¯r(t)δjlδkl,
considered under assumption (A2), would guarantee an eﬃcient market
independent of the market state.

If Eq. (59) holds, a perturbative expansion in the oﬀ-diagonal elements of
Bi
..;l should be accurate and independent investors would remain almost
independent in their decisions even when gains and losses are possible.

The assumptions (A1)-(A4) appear to be satisﬁed on the stock market in
”normal” times. We next derive the probability distribution for the evolution
of stock prices in such an equilibrium.

5 The Evolution of Stock Prices in an Equilibrium Market

In an equilibrium market the conditional probability PT (s′
s) that a particular
|
stock can be sold for s′ dollars if it was purchased for s dollars a time T ago
is known to be very close to lognormal2,

(60)

The parameter µ in Eq. (60) is the expected return of the stock and σ is known
as its volatility. The statistical interpretation of Eq. (60) is that the yield of a
stock in an equilibrium market depends on many additive and statistically in-
dependent factors, whose number essentially grows proportional to the elapsed
time T . Phenomenologically there appear to be exceptions to this behavior
over very short time periods4,5,10, during market upheavals and due to rare
events2, i.e. the probability that a stock becomes worthless in a ﬁnite time T
does not appear to vanish as rapidly as the distribution of Eq. (60) suggests.

22

However, Eq. (60) does seem to reproduce the observed stock price distribu-
tion of ”normal” markets on a time-scale of a few months, especially near the
maximum of the distribution, where it matters most. From this point of view,
the hypothesis that all stock price probability distributions follow Eq. (60)
after a suﬃciently long time could serve as the deﬁnition of an equilibrium
market.

In our quantum model of ﬁnance, one can derive Eq. (60) under the
assumption that (A1)-(A4) are satisﬁed and the behavior of the market is
suﬃciently smooth. We show this by calculating the conditional probability
PT (s′

s) for the price of a generic stock under such conditions.
|

Without loss of generality, we consider the stock of company Doe with
index i = 0. Joe, the investor with index j = 0, purchases one contract of
Doe stock for s dollars at time t = ti. We are interested in the probability,
s), that he can sell his Doe contract for s′ dollars at time t = tf = ti + T .

To simplify the calculation, Joe should have ample cash to ﬁnance any trades
during the time of interest. Prior to t = ti and after t = tf we further stipulate
that Joe holds no Doe stock.

placed by the time independent operator ˆH0(ti)in Eq. (64). It is advantageous
to explicitly isolate the dependence of ˆH0(ti) on the creation and annihilation

equilibrium market, this assumption may appear to be a simpliﬁcation that
can hardly be fully justiﬁed. Fortunately, the result will not depend sensitively

if the market is a superposition of states with eigenvalues close to Ei. In the

Without a detailed knowledge of the states and energies, it is impossible to
evaluate the ﬁnite sum in Eq. (67). However, in an equilibrium market with
a large number of investors in Doe stock, the energies EQ of many relevant
states are probably themselves rather close to Ei + A + qB, the unperturbed
energy of the initial state. Joe, after all, is just one of many similar investors.
In Eq. (67) the initial energy has been given a small negative imaginary part to
ensure that no state grows in norm for asymptotically large times. This small
imaginary part determines how the case EQ = Ei + A + qB is to be treated.

For a ﬁnite number of investors J and ﬁxed Ei, the imaginary part, σ2(q),
is a sum of δ-distributions with support at speciﬁc q-values only. However,
this is an artifact of the assumption that the initial state is an eigenstate with
eigenvalue Ei and of our neglect of higher order contributions in the local
approximation to ˆH(t). Smearing (that is a ﬁnite limit for ε in Eq. (68)) the δ-
distributions a little results in a function σ2(q)
0 that is analytic near q = 0.
The required smearing simulates the fact that the energy Ei of the initial
state is not absolutely sharp. Alternatively one could imagine an even more
idealized scenario in which the number of investors J becomes arbitrary large.

a way that Eq. (59) remains valid in many respects is a rather natural point

Because we neglected other corrections to the real part of the energy of
similar magnitude, consistency with the local approximation demands that we
ignore contributions of order q2 to the real part of the energy Eq. However,
the leading contribution q2σ2(0) to the imaginary part of the energy should be
retained. Note that second order perturbation theory is suﬃcient to determine
this leading contribution to the imaginary part – other approximations diﬀer in
order q3 only. To order q in the real part and leading order q2 in the imaginary

Perhaps more interesting than the derivation of the lognormal price distribu-

that were made and the interpretation of the parameters of the Hamiltonian
this derivation provides.

(74)

The stock’s volatility σi is given by Eq. (70).
It is remarkable that to this
order of the approximation the ”chemical potentials” Ai
jj for the number of
securities of type i held by independent investor j enter the volatility only. The
volatility of a stock also depends indirectly on the ”state” of the market, here
described by the eigenvalue Ei. The expected return of the stock apparently
does not. This is consistent with the notion that the expected return of a stock
is related to the performance of the company and should not depend on how
the outstanding stock and cash are distributed among investors, whereas the
volatility of a stock does depend on the stock’s distribution among investors as
well as the market. This separation of eﬀects was not anticipated in the formu-
lation of the model, which is based on trading probabilities. Eq. (70) relates
the volatility of a stock to the probability that it is traded. The expression for
the volatility in Eq. (70) is analogous to that of an absorption cross-section
and implies that an increase in the trading rate for a stock should be accompa-
nied by an increase in its volatility. It is perhaps not unreasonable that such a
relation should exist, since high trading volume appears to be associated with
larger changes in price11. It is, however, amusing that this highly simpliﬁed
model of the market gives such a relation.

Note that we have made extensive use of Fourier-analysis without ﬁnan-
cially interpreting the variable q, the conjugate quantity to ln(s/λ). In particle
theory q would be interpreted as the wave number – but what does a wave-
number signify ﬁnancially? Contrary to the interference demonstrations in par-
ticle physics, no ﬁnancial experiment presently determines the wave-number
of a stock. The analogy with a quantum particle and the observation that
trading ceases at q = 0 for any stock, suggest that q is proportional to the rate
of return q = mdx/dt+O(q2) for suﬃciently small q, where the proportionality
constant m is a characteristic of the stock. Heisenberg’s famous Uncertainty
Relation8 supports this interpretation. The Uncertainty Relation essentially
is the mathematical statement that the variance σ2

bution ρ(x) =

Eq. (76) restricts the joint measurement of any two conjugate variables – it
in particular is not possible to measure both to arbitrary accuracy. As one
distribution becomes more sharply peaked, the variance of the distribution for
the conjugate variable necessarily increases.

For the lognormal probability distribution of Eq. (60), the uncertainty in
the price of a stock after a period T is σx = σ√T . The uncertainty in the
σ/√T . The standard
(average) rate of return over this period thus is σ ˙x ∼
deviation of the distribution ρ(q) for the conjugate variable, that can be read
oﬀ the Fourier-amplitude Eq. (71), is σq = 1/(2σ√T ). The Uncertainty Rela-
tion Eq. (76) in this case holds as an equality (because the distributions are
Gaussian). The uncertainty in the average return and the uncertainty of q
clearly are proportional with the proportionality constant,

2m = σ−2 .

(77)

Note that the volatility is an unchanging characteristic of the stock in the
lognormal model (the only one apart from the stock’s average return). The
wave-number q and the rate of return ˙x in general are proportional only near
q = ˙x = 0. The observed volatility may depend on time and the quantity
in Eq. (77) is the volatility for suﬃciently long time intervals (when the distri-
bution is close to lognormal). Similar to particles in a medium, the observed
”mass” m of a stock (or the inverse of its volatility) furthermore varies with
changes in the environment. It is perhaps interesting that equilibration to a
lognormal price distribution for suﬃciently long times occurs only for stocks
with m > 0. This perhaps can be related to the (infrared) instability of 1+1
dimensional ﬁeld theories with massless excitations.

Unlike the wave number of particles, that of stocks is not a ﬁnancial charac-
teristic that is readily measured or prepared. However, before the now famous
interference experiments, a wave interpretation of particle behavior would have
seemed equally absurd. Since the amplitudes for conjugate variables are related
by Fourier-transformation, all the information is contained in the amplitude for
either. Monitoring the price of a stock thus exhausts the available information
and no advantage is gained by also measuring its wave number in some way.
Finance in this sense perhaps is the penultimate quantum model, in which the
construction of the probability distribution for the variable conjugate to the
logarithm of the price is mainly a matter of mathematical convenience.

Let me ﬁnally summarize the assumptions about the stock market, which
in leading approximation lead to the lognormal price distribution of Eq. (60).

29

1) Incremental trading with small proﬁts/losses from individual trades

2) A time interval T that is short compared to any characteristic periods of

variation of the market as a whole.

3) The market can be viewed as isolated during the time interval T , without

major injections or extractions of cash or newly issued stock.

4) In any short period of time it is far more probable that the stock is

retained than that it is traded.

5) A large number of similar investors in the stock.

One should expect deviations from a lognormal price distribution if one or the
other of these condition is not met. Lognormal distributions in particular prob-
ably are not characteristic for a market with few and/or very diﬀerent investors
or in situations where relatively large proﬁts/losses in individual trades can
have a signiﬁcant impact on the price distribution. It may be worth investigat-
ing whether the deviations from the lognormal distribution observed for short
times10, which in stochastic models is simulated by a stochastic volatility4 or
a non-random walk5, in the present formulation require the inclusion of higher
Fourier-moments in the expansion of Eq. (47) or simply reﬂect the behavior of
σ2(q) for

A Non-Isolated Markets, Time Dependent Hamiltonians and the

Generating Functional

The model Hamiltonian Eq. (37) for trading preserves the number of securities
of every type as well as the overall available cash. It does not take into account
initial (public) oﬀerings, consumption, or the possibility of earning cash from
other sources. The primary oﬀering of a security and its initial sale to a group
of investors can, however, be simulated by a coherent initial state. Such a state

Both operators commute with ˆH0 and therefore correspond to conserved quan-

The spectrum of ˆH ′

0 is symmetric about the origin and identical in form to
that for free, massive relativistic particles and holes. The gap of the spectrum
between positive and negative frequency states is 2ω0, with

Note that the frequency gap in Eq. (92) is proportional to the diﬀerence of the
”chemical” potentials of the two investors and vanishes when A22 = A11, and in
particular vanishes when the two investors are similar. The oﬀset q0 vanishes
also when B11 = B22. Our previous interpretation of the average diagonal
entries of the B-matrix as the expected return of the stock, suggests that the
oﬀset is related to diﬀerent expected returns of the investors. The discussion
in section 4.2 is consistent with the notion that in an eﬃcient market without
competitive advantage of either investor,

B11 = B22 ,

(95)

= 0 thus is a measure for the ineﬃciency
and therefore q0 = 0. An oﬀset q0 6
of the market, or equivalently, the competitive advantage of one of the two
investors over the other.

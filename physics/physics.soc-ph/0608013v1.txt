Abstract

Constant and symmetric price impact functions, most commonly used in agent-based market

modelling, are shown to give rise to paradoxical and inconsistent outcomes in the simplest case of

arbitrage exploitation when open-hold-close actions are considered. The solution of the paradox

lies in the non-constant nature of real-life price impact functions. A simple model that includes

explicit position opening, holding, and closing is brieﬂy introduced and its information ecology

discussed, shedding new light on the relevance of the Minority Game to the study of ﬁnancial

markets.

The immense majority of agent-based ﬁnancial market models relies on two fundamen-

tal assumptions: constant and often symmetric price impact function, and agents with a

strategy time-horizon of a single time step (see e.g.

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]). Both of them

are useful simpliﬁcations that made possible some understanding of the dynamics of such

models. But the modelling of ﬁnancial markets crucially depends (or should depend) on

the fact that earning or losing money occurs while doing nothing, that is, while holding a

position. This is to be compared with mainstream agent-based models where the agents’

gain is the result of transactions. Since these models are generally deﬁned in discrete time,

one could in principle argue that one time step is long enough to include holding periods,

but this is inconsistent with the nature of most ﬁnancial markets.

Indeed, the buy/sell

orders arrive usually asynchronously in continuous time, which rules out the possibility of

synchronous trading; even more, the order in which the limit orders are submitted raises

important questions about the nature of ﬁnancial markets [8].

Let me start with the price impact function. Such a function I(n) is by deﬁnition the

relative price change induced by a transaction of n (integer) shares; mathematically,

p(t + 1) = p(t) + I(n),

(1)

where p(t) is the log-price and t is the transaction time. The above notation misleadingly

suggests that I does not depend on time. In reality, not only I suﬀers from random ﬂuctu-

ations, but also, for instance, from strong feed-back from the sign of the last transactions,

which has long memory (see e.g. [9, 10, 11] for discussions about the dynamical nature of

market impact). Neglecting the dynamics of I has the eﬀect of considering speciﬁc shapes

for I that enforce some properties of price impact for each transaction, whereas they should

only hold on average. For example, one should restrict oneself to the class of functions that

make it impossible to obtain round-trip positive gains [12]. But the inappropriateness of

constant price impact functions is all the more obvious as soon as one considers how price

predictability is removed by speculation, which is inter-temporal by nature.

The most intuitive (but wrong) view of market ineﬃciency is to consider price predictabil-

ity as a scalar deviation from the unpredictable case: if there were a relative price deviation

r0 caused by a transaction of n0 shares at some time t, according to this view, one should

exchange n1 shares so as to cancel perfectly this anomaly, where n1 is such that I(n1) = −r0.

This view amounts to regard predictability as something that can be remedied with a single

2

trade. However, the people that would try and cancel r0 would not gain anything by doing

this, unless they are market makers who try to stabilise the price. Speculators on the other

hand make money by opening, holding, and closing positions. In other words, a perfectly

(and probably illegally) informed speculator will take advantage of his knowledge by opening

a position at time t − 1 and closing it at time t + 1. This will yield a gain of

γ1 = n1[r0 − I(n1) − |I(−n1)|].

Assuming that I is an odd function, the gain reduces to γ1 = n1[r0 − 2I(n1)]. Since I(n)

generally increases with n, there is an optimal n∗
power-law price impact I(n) = Knα,

1 number of shares that maximises γ1. For

1/α

which simpliﬁes to r0/4 in the case of linear price impact I(n) = n. The discussion so far is

a simpliﬁcation of the one found in Ref. [12]. Far from diminishing price predictability, the

intervention of trader 1 increases the ﬂuctuations. Therefore, in the framework of constant

price impact functions, predictability never vanishes but becomes less and less exploitable

because of the ﬂuctuations and the reduction of signal-to-noise ratio caused by the specu-

lators. The other obvious consequence of the activity of trader 1 is the additional cost for
trader 0, who must pay a premium equal to n0I(n1) where n0 = |I −1(r0)|.

It seems that trader 1 cannot achieve a better gain than by holding n∗

1 shares at time

t. However, he can inform a fully trustable friend, trader 2, of the gain opportunity on the

condition that the latter opens his position before t − 1 and closes it after t + 1 so as to

avoid modifying the gain of trader 1. For instance, trader 2 informs trader 1 when he has

opened his position and trader 1 tells trader 2 when he has closed his position. From the

point of view of trader 2, this is very reasonable because the resulting action of trader 1 is to

leave the arbitrage opportunity unchanged to r0 since p(t + 1) − p(t − 1) = r0. Trader 2 will
consequently buy n∗

1 shares at time t − 2 and sell them at time t + 2, earning the same
amount of money as trader 1. This can go on until trader i has no fully trustable friend.

2 = n∗

Note that the advantage of trader 1 is that he holds a position over a smaller time interval,

thereby increasing his return rate. Before explaining the paradox of this situation, it makes

sense to emphasise that the gains of trader i > 0 are of course obtained at the expense of

trader 0, and that the result the particular order of the traders’ actions is to create a bubble

which peaks at time t.

3

The paradox is the following: if trader 1 is alone, the most that can be extracted from

his perfect knowledge is γ1(n∗

1) according to the above reasoning. When there are N traders

in the ring of trust, the total money extracted is N times the optimal gain of a single

trader. Now, assume that trader 1 has two brokering accounts; he could play with each

1) on each of his accounts. The paradox is that his actions would be completely

of his accounts, respecting the order in which to open and close his positions, eﬀectively
earning γ1(n∗
equivalent to investing n∗
seems a priori exactly similar to grouping the two transactions into 2n∗
course in a gain smaller than g1(n∗

1 from the same account. In the case of I(n) = n, this
1, but this results of

1) for a doubled investment. Hence, in this framework,

1 and then n∗

trader 1 can earn as much as it pleases him provided that he splits his investment into
sub-parts of n∗

1 shares.

Two criticisms can be raised. First, the ring of trust must be perfect for this scheme to

work, otherwise a Prisoner’s dilemma arises, as it is advantageous for trader i + 1 to defect

and close his position before trader i. In that case, the expected payoﬀ for each trader is of

order 1/N, as in Ref [12].

But more importantly, one may expect that the above discussion depends crucially on

the fact that r0 does not depend on the actual price, or equivalently that trader 0 wishes to

buy or to sell a pre-determined number of shares. One must therefore examine the situation

where trader 0 has a ﬁxed budget C and wishes to spend it to buy shares of the asset. In

this case, the return at time t, after trader 1 has bought n1 shares is

r1 = I[Ce

−p0−I(n1)] = I[n0/eI(n1)],

(4)

which reduces to r0 = I(n0) = I(C/ep0) when trader 1 does not exploit the arbitrage. The

calculus is made easier by the choice I(x) = log x, which has some empirical ground [13], and
which leads to r1 = log n0 −log n1. The optimal number of shares for player 1 is n∗
while his gain γ∗

0 /e and r1 = log(n0)2/3 + 1.

1 is now 3n1/3

1 = n1/3

0 /e,

It is not anymore the interest of trader 1 to communicate the existence of the arbitrage

opportunity to one of his friends, unless he sells this information for a sum ∆γ∗

1 that com-

pensates for the reduction of arbitrage caused by trader 2.

Indeed the return at time t

caused by trader 0 is now r2 = r1 − log(n2), hence

∆γ∗

1 = n∗

1(r1 − r2) =

log n2.

Therefore trader 2 optimises

γ2 = n2[r2 − 2I(n2)] − ∆γ∗
1.

The paradox survives if one can ﬁnd n2 such that γ2 > 0. Extremalising γ2 with respect

to n2 yields the transcendental equation

This equation has two solutions, one with n∗

ing to a minimum of γ2, while the one with n2 > 1 corresponds to a maximum of γ2 for any
n0 ≥ 1. A (relatively poor) upper bound to n∗

One deduces from these two equations that there is always a n∗

2 that maximises γ2 whose

sign must still be determined as a function of n0. The optimal number of shares for traders

1 and 2 is relatively small compared to n0, as shown by Fig. 1. Curiously, although n2

grows more slowly than n1, n2 > n1 as long as n0 is smaller than about 8000. It should

also be noted that n1 becomes larger than 1, that is, the arbitrage opportunity really exists

if n0 ≥ 21. The respective gains, however, are of course in favor of trader 1 (Fig 2): the

gain of trader 2 is only positive as long as n0 < 41. Therefore, even in the case where the

arbitrage opportunity depends on the market impact of the traders trying to exploit it, there

is a small window of n0 ∈ [21, 40] such that the paradox still exists, whose size and position

probably depend on the price impact function.[18]

The solution to this paradox lies in the feed-back from past actions onto the order book.

For instance, although the sign of market orders has a long memory [9, 10], the market is still

eﬃcient because the order book’s reaction prevents statistical arbitrage, decreases notably

the exploitability of r0.[19]

An important point raised by the above discussion is the need to consider markets in

transaction time if one wishes to understand their minute dynamics, which in turn begs for

models where the agents’ actions are inter-temporal and intertwined. The design of simple

models that allow the agent to open, hold, and close their position explicitely faces two

problems. First, as explained above, a speculator makes money when holding a position;

therefore a trader that has an open position wishes to know for how long he should hold it,

or equivalently, when to close it. Given the amount of randomness in the markets, one is

only interested in a criterion based on statistical analysis of market history; in other words,

this criterion should only be trusted on average. The next problem to ﬁnd a trading strategy

6

space that has as few parameters as possible. One possibility is to study strategies reportedly

used by practitioners as in Ref.

[14]; they usually prescribe very concretely when to open

and close a position as a function of the current price and of other parameters. Another

possibility is to take inspiration from the Minority Game and to look for a strategy space

based on states of the world (which might include statistics about past prices) that contains

a ﬁnite and countable number of elements; in that way, one still expects the behaviour of

the system to change signiﬁcantly when the number of agents exceeds the eﬀective number

of available strategies.

It is reasonable to assume that real-life traders base their decisions on signals or patterns,

such as mispricing (over/undervaluation), technical analysis, crossing of moving averages,

news, etc. How to close a position is a matter of more variations: one can assume a ﬁxed-

time horizon, stop gains, stop losses, etc.

I assume that the traders are inactive unless

they receive some signal because some known pattern arises. Therefore, the agents hold

their positions between two recognisable patterns. All the kinds of information regarded as

possibly relevant by all the traders form the ensemble of the patterns which is assumed to

be countable and ﬁnite. Mathematically, the state of the world is fully characterised by an

integer number µ ∈ {1, · · · , P }.

Each trader recognises only a few patterns, because he has access to or can analyse only

a limited number of information sources, or because he does not regard the other ones

as relevant; in the present model, a trader is assigned at random a small set of personal

patterns which is kept ﬁxed during the whole duration of the simulation. Every time one

of his patterns arises, he decides whether to open/close a position according to his measure

of the average return between all the pairs of patterns that he is able to recognise. This is

precisely how people using crossings of moving averages behave: take the case of a trader

comparing two exponential moving averages (EMA) EMA100 and EMA200, with memory

of 100, respectively 200 days: such trader is inactive unless EMA100 and EMA200 cross; the

two types of crossing deﬁne two signals, or patterns. For instance, a set of patterns could

be the 20 possible crossings between EMAs with memory length of 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200

days.

The hope and the role of a trader are to identify pairs of patterns such that the average

price return between two patterns is larger than some benchmark, for instance a risk-free rate

(neglecting risk for the sake of simplicity); in this sense the agents follow the past average

FIG. 3: Price volatility σ2 (circles), price impact H/P (squares), naive predictability J (down

(diamonds), and average gain per speculator and per time step (right triangles); P = 5, Np = 10,

ǫ = 0.05; average over 10000 samples of speculators

trend between two patterns, which makes sense if the average return is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent

from the risk-free rate. In contrast with many other models (e.g. Ref [7]), the agents do

not switch between trend-followers/fundamentalist/noise traders during the course of the

simulation.

The full deﬁnition of the model can be found elsewhere [8].[20] A most valuable conse-

quence of the way the model is deﬁned is that, similarly to the Minority Game, one can

introduce a well-controlled amount of predictabily and study how some agents, named specu-

lators remove it. The similarity of the interplay between price ﬂuctuations and predictability

in this model and in the Minority Game is striking (Fig. 3): the more speculators one adds,

the less predictable the market (J and K, lower left panel), and also the smaller the price

ﬂuctuations (σ2, upper left panel); in addition, the average number of active speculators

saturates, and their gain, positive when they are only a few, decreases and becomes neg-

8

ative when they are too many. The similarity stops there, since the predictability seems

impossible to completely remove with the kind of strategies available to the agents; more

precisely, the agents do not seem to be able to manage to remove more than a fraction of it.

Nevertheless, the above similarity substantiates the use of the MG as a model of information

ecology, and suggests the need to re-interpret it.

Generally speaking, a minority mechanism is found when agents compete for a limited

resource, or equivalently when they try to determine collectively by trial and error the

(sometimes implicit) resource level, and synchronise their actions so that the demand equals

the resource on average [15, 16]. As a consequence, an agent is tempted to exploit the

resource more than his fair share, hoping that the other agents happen to take a smaller

share of it. The limited resource in ﬁnancial markets is predictability and indeed information

ecology is one of the most fascinating and plausible insights of minority games into market

dynamics [6, 17]. Instead of regarding the diﬀerence between the number of agents choosing

+1 and the ones choosing −1, denoted A(t), in the MG as the instantaneous excess demand,

one should reinterpret it as the deviation from unpredictability A = 0 at time t. The two

actions can be for instance to exploit an ineﬃciency (+1) or to refrain from it (−1); A in this

context would measure how eﬃciently an ineﬃciency is being exploited. Then everything

becomes clearer: the fact that A(t) display mean-reverting behaviour is not problematic any

more as it is not a price return. It simply means when the agents tend to under-exploit

some predictability, they are likely to exploit it more in the next time steps, and reversely.

What price return correspond to a given A is not speciﬁed by the MG, but herding in the

information space (the MG) should translate into interesting dynamics of relevant ﬁnancial

quantities such as volume and price; for instance, dynamical correlations of |A| in the MG

probably correspond to dynamical correlations in the volume of transactions. Therefore,

studying the building up of volatility feedback, long-range memory and fat-tailed A still

makes sense, but not in a view to model explicitly price returns.

A more formal relationship is that in the MG the state of the world (or history) µ in

akin to a pair of pattern in the inter-temporal model, showing in more details the kind of

approximation made in the information structure of the MG: the intrisically inter-twined

nature of transactions and predictability is neglected, that is, the dependence of the average

price returns between µ1 and µ2 and, for instance, between µ1 and µ3 is simply replaced by
two independent quantities hA|µ′i and hA|µ′′i, in the standard notation of the MG.

9

In conclusion, dropping the assumption of constant price impact functions and exploring

the world of inter-temporal speculation will bring new and fascinating insights on ﬁnancial

market dynamics. One should aim to ﬁnd an inter-temporal model amenable to mathemat-

ical analysis, or a mathematical analysis of the model discussed above.

Abstract

We construct a correlation matrix based ﬁnancial network for a set of New York
Stock Exchange (NYSE) traded stocks with stocks corresponding to nodes and the
links between them added one after the other, according to the strength of the
correlation between the nodes. The eigenvalue spectrum of the correlation matrix
reﬂects the structure of the market, which also shows in the cluster structure of
the emergent network. The stronger and more compact a cluster is, the earlier the
eigenvalue representing the corresponding business sector occurs in the spectrum.
On the other hand, if groups of stocks belonging to a given business sector are
considered as a fully connected subgraph of the ﬁnal network, their intensity and
coherence can be monitored as a function of time. This approach indicates to what
extent the business sector classiﬁcations are visible in market prices, which in turn
enables us to gauge the extent of group-behaviour exhibited by stocks belonging to
a given business sector.

1 Introduction

In the world of business, companies interact with one another, creating an
evolving complex system (1). While the details of these interactions are not
known, as far as price changes are concerned, they are reﬂected in the corre-
lations of stock prices. Correlations are central in investment theory and risk
management, and also serve as inputs to the portfolio optimisation problem
in the classical Markowitz portfolio theory (2).

Complex networks can be seen to provide a general framework for studying
systems with large numbers of interacting agents (3). The nodes of the network

represent the agents and a link connecting two nodes indicates an interaction
between them. In this framework, interactions have typically been considered
binary in nature, meaning that two nodes are either connected or not. However,
in a system with correlated nodes the notion of binary interactions implies
setting a threshold value for interaction strength, above which the link exists
and below it does not. This entails a certain loss of information as for the
properties of the system, which can be circumvented by assigning weights on
the links to reﬂect their interaction strengths. These are naturally identiﬁed
by the corresponding elements of the correlation matrix.

In this paper we study a ﬁnancial network in which the nodes correspond
to stocks and links to return correlation based interactions between them.
Mantegna (4) was the ﬁrst to construct such networks and the idea was then
followed and extended by others (5; 6; 7; 8; 9).

2 Network Construction

We start by considering a price time series for a set of N stocks and denote
the daily closing price of stock i at time τ (an actual date) by Pi(τ ). Here we
will analyse N = 116 NYSE-traded stocks from the S&P 500 index over the
period from 1.1.1982 to 31.12.2000, consisting the total of 4787 daily closing
price quotes for each stock. As it is common among investors in the ﬁnancial
market, we will work in terms of relative returns deﬁned as ri(τ ) = ln Pi(τ ) −
ln Pi(τ − 1). For the purpose of smoothening, we set a moving time window of
width T , here T = 1000 trading days (≈ 4 years, for 250 trading days a year),
and obtain a return vector rt
i for stock i, where the superscript t enumerates the
time window under consideration. Now the equal time correlation coeﬃcients
between assets i and j can be written as follows

ρt
ij =

irt
hrt
2i − hrt

ji − hrt
ii2][hrt
j

iihrt
ji
2i − hrt

ji2]

,

q[hrt
i

(1)

where h...i indicates a time average over the consecutive trading days included
in the return vectors. These correlation coeﬃcients between N assets form a
symmetric N × N correlation matrix Ct with elements ρt
ij. The time windows
are displaced by δT , where we have used a step size of one trading week, i.e.
δT = 5 days.

We construct the network ﬁrst by ranking the interaction strengths wij taken
as absolute values of the correlation coeﬃcients. Due to the fact that ρt
ij vary
between −1 and 1, the interaction strengths wt
ij| are limited to the [0, 1]
interval. Then the network is constructed such that the links are added one

ij = |ρt

2

after the other, starting from the strongest one according to the ranking. The
emergent network is characterized by a parameter p, namely the ratio of the
created links to the number of all possible links, N(N − 1)/2. In the end of the
procedure when p = 1, we have a fully connected weighted network. In (10) we
have reported this approach and found clear evidence of strong intra-business
sector clustering for low values of p, where we followed the Forbes business
sector labelling of stocks into 12 categories, such as Energy and Utilities (11).

3 Spectral Properties

The spectra of ﬁnancial correlation matrices have been studied in detail, pro-
ducing interesting results (12). The eigenvalues can be classiﬁed as follows: i)
There is a quasi-continuum of small eigenvalues which can be well described
by the random matrix theory corresponding to noise, and the majority of them
fall into this category. ii) The largest eigenvalue is far from the rest and it cor-
responds to the global behaviour of the market. iii) The discrete spectrum of
intermediate eigenvalues carries important information about the correlations
that can be related to market taxonomy. As an example of applications, the
eigenvalue spectrum can be used to denoise the correlation matrix (13). The
eigenvalue spectrum also reﬂects the business sector structure of the network.
Therefore, it is natural to ask the question: How do the typical eigenvalues
emerge as a function of the ratio of the links present or occupation p?

Here we calculate the eigenvalue spectrum of the matrix wij − δij for diﬀer-
ent values of p, where δij is the Kronecker delta function. Starting from the
strongest links ﬁrst the most correlated parts emerge in the network. They
form separated clusters with high clustering coeﬃcients, thus the emerging
structure is far from random. The eigenvalue spectrum reﬂects this property.
Already for very small values of p the largest eigenvalue separates from the
rest and the components are quite uniformly distributed among the stocks al-
ready included in the network, indicating the dominance of the global market
behaviour. To give the eigenvalues some physical meaning it is convenient to
plot the values of each of the 116 components of the eigenvector corresponding
to the chosen eigenvalue.

For small p the next largest eigenvalues have a clear meaning: They correspond
to highly correlated business sectors which emerge ﬁrst in the network as
isolated clusters. These eigenvalues are inherited to the p = 1 case (though
their ranking can change). Fig. 1 shows two such eigenvalues; for the fully
connected graph (p = 1) and for low occupation, p = 0.024. This value of p
corresponds to 160 links in the network at which stage its structure is shown
in Fig. 2. We can conclude that the visually well-separated clusters for low
occupation p induces a large eigenvalue in the category iii) which is inherited

4 Subgraph Intensity and Coherence

In order to study the clustering properties in more detail, let us consider any
cluster or subgraph g in these networks by deﬁning two additional measures.
To characterise how compact or tight the subgraph is, we use the concept of
subgraph intensity I(g) introduced earlier in (14). This measure allows us to
characterise the interaction patterns within clusters. By denoting vg the set of
nodes and ℓg the set of links in the subgraph with weights wij, we can express
subgraph intensity as the geometric mean of its weights as

I(g) = 


Y
(ij)∈ℓg

wij





1/|ℓg|

.

However, with this deﬁnition the subgraph intensity I(g) may turn out to be
low because one of the weights is very low, or all the weights are low. In order
to distinguish between these two extremes, we use the concept of subgraph
coherence Q(g) introduced in (14) and deﬁned as the ratio of the geometric
mean to the arithmetic mean of the weights:

Q(g) = I|ℓg|/ X

wij.

(ij)∈ℓg

This coherence measure gets values in the [0, 1] interval and is close to unity
only if the subgraph weights do not diﬀer much, i.e. they are internally co-
herent. To compare the intensity and coherence values of various clusters, we
establish a reference, consisting the entire market. In other words, we take
all the N nodes and N(N − 1)/2 links making up the entire network G, and
then with Eqs. 2 and 3 calculate I(G) and Q(G), respectively. Here we will
use the relative quantities, i.e. relative cluster intensity for cluster g, given by
I(g)/I(G), and relative cluster coherence, given by Q(g)/Q(G).

We will apply these measures to the same set of 116 NYSE-traded stocks
from the S&P 500 index and devide the stocks into clusters by using the same
business sector labels for each stocks as above (11). Given these labels for each
stock, we determine the subgraph intensity and coherence to gauge how stocks
belonging to a given business sector behave as a function of time. Now let us
consider a cluster gn, constructed such that all of its nodes vg belong to the
same business sector and n denotes the number of nodes in this cluster. Then
we add all the n(n − 1)/2 links corresponding to the interaction strengths
between nodes within gn. In one extreme, if all the link weights are equal to
unity, every node in gn interacts maximally with its n − 1 neighbours. In the
other extreme, if one or more of the weights are zero, the subgraph intensity for
the fully connected subgraph gn tends to zero because the original topological

structure no longer exists. While this may seem extreme, it is important to
realize that the companies of any given business sector are expected to interact,
at least to some extent, with all other companies within the sector. In practise,
however, it rarely happens that we would have a weight wij = 0 exactly.

In Fig. 3(a) we show the relative cluster intensity as a function of time for
selected business sector clusters. Here the values above unity indicate that the
intensity of the cluster is higher than that of the market. This implies that
in most cases stocks belonging to a given business sector are tied together
in the sense that intra-cluster interaction strengths are considerably stronger
than the whole market interaction. In the inset of Fig. 3(a) we have depicted
the absolute cluster intensity for the whole market, which shows high values
roughly between 1986 and 1990. This is caused by stock market crash (Black
Monday, 1987) when the market behaves in a uniﬁed manner. It should be
noted here that although the crash is a localized event, in our analysis it covers
an extended period due to the moving window length being four years. From
Fig. 3(a) we also see that the crash compresses the relative cluster intensities,
which means that the cluster-speciﬁc behaviour is temporarily suppressed by
the crash. After the market recovers, the clusters regain their normal structural
features (15).

In Fig. 3(b) we show the relative coherence as a function of time for selected
business sector clusters. All clusters except Basic Materials turn out to be
more coherent than the market. One possible explanation is that for Basic
Materials the industry classiﬁcation scheme is too course, because in ﬁner
classiﬁcation this sector includes stocks diversely from Metal Mining, Paper,
Gold & Silver and Forestry & Wood Products. Consequently, it is not that
surprising that the cluster intensity remains low, at times even falling below
the market reference. Similarly, the low coherence values indicate that there
are stocks in this cluster with very high correlations due to those belonging to
the same industry, such as gold mining, but also very low due to companies

belonging to diﬀerent industries. In conclusion, our results indicate that, in
most cases, stocks belonging to the same business sector have higher intensity
and more coherent intra-cluster than inter-cluster interactions.

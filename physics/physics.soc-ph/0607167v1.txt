Abstract

This paper presents an empirical investigation of the intraday Brazilian stock market
price ﬂuctuations, considering q-Gaussian distributions that emerge from a non-
extensive statistical mechanics. Our results show that, when returns are measured
over intervals less than one hour, the empirical distributions are well ﬁtted by q-
Gaussians with exponential damped tails. Scaling behavior is also observed for these
microscopic time intervals. We ﬁnd that the time evolution of the distributions is
according to a super diﬀusive q-Gaussian stationary process within a nonlinear
Fokker-Planck equation. This regime breaks down due to the exponential fall-oﬀ of
the tails, which in turn, governs the transient dynamics to the long-term macroscopic
Gaussian regime. Our results suggest that this modeling provides a framework for
the description of the dynamics of stock markets intraday price ﬂuctuations.

statistical description of these ﬂuctuations, a complete and consistent descrip-
tion of the distributions and its dynamics in the high-frequency regime is still
lacking.

It is well known that high-frequency ﬁnancial time series such as foreign ex-
change rates or stock market returns are long-memory non-Gaussian processes.
Such complex behavior calls for advanced theories in the ﬁeld of statistical
physics. Whence, we consider the recently proposed non-extensive statistical
physics [3], a theory that generalizes the extensive classical statistical theory
for strong dependent variables. A large number of studies [4,5,6,7] of ﬁnancial
markets have already employed the non-extensive statistics in their analysis.

In this paper, we investigate the intraday dynamics of the BOVESPA index,
the ﬁnancial index of the Brazilian stock market, one of the largest emerging
markets in the world. We model the distributions of the index price ﬂuctu-
ations by q-Gaussians, which are a class of stable distributions that emerge
from the non-extensive approach, and where the parameter q measures the
degree of the non-extensivity of the stochastic process.

We ﬁnd that for time horizons less than one hour, the probability distributions
of price ﬂuctuations are well ﬁtted by q-Gaussians with damped exponential
tails. A q-Gaussian scaling at the centre of the distributions with q*=1.75 is
observed, which holds over these high frequency time scales due to the presence
of strong correlations. The quasi-stationary q*-Gaussian regime breaks down
due to the exponentially truncated tails and a new intraday correlated regime
emerges at larger time scales, in which the q*-Gaussian central part of the
distributions are consumed by the exponential tails.

The dynamics in the short-time regime is in agreement with the prediction
of a super diﬀusive q-Gaussian stationary process governed by a nonlinear
Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) that models the correlated anomalous diﬀusion
found for high frequency price ﬂuctuations. Therefore, we present a coherent
description encompassing non-extensive statistics and an evolution equation.

This paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we describe the empirical
observations for the high-frequency BOVESPA index. In section 3, we present
the non-extensive statistical theory. In sections 4 and 5, these observations are
analyzed by using the non-extensive approach. In section 6, we present some
concluding remarks.

2 Empirical results

Our results are based on analyzing BOVESPA index high-frequency 30-seconds
interval data collected from November 2002 to June 2004, a period without
major local market disturbances. This data consists of a set of 352500 prices
(index values) p(t) which allows a fairly statistical analysis.

From this database, we select a complete set of non-overlapping price ﬂuctu-
ations (returns):

occurring in τ -intraday interval. We deﬁne the normalized returns as:

xτ (t) = ln p(t + τ ) − ln p(t)

xN
τ (t) = (xτ (t) − µτ )/στ

(1)

(2)

where µτ and στ are respectively the mean and the standard deviation of xτ (t).

To characterize quantitatively the observed stochastic process, we measure the
probability distribution P (xN
τ ) of index price ﬂuctuations for τ ranging from
1 to 60 minutes. The number of data in each set decreases from the maximum
value of 176250 (τ = 1 min) to the minimum value of 29375 (τ = 60 min).

pect distribution for a Gaussian process (open squares).

In ﬁgure 1 we show the measured (non-normalized) probability distribution for
τ = 1 min normalized returns and compare with the expected distribution for
the Gaussian process. The empirical distribution is clearly fat tailed, indicating
that non-Gaussian time series analysis is required.

The scaling behavior of the distributions at coarser time scales has diﬀerent
regimes. At micro scales (typically shorter than one hour), correlations be-
tween successive price changes are dominant due to informational ﬂow between
the ﬁnancial trades. On the other hand, at macro scales (typically larger than
one month) macroeconomic rules govern the market drift and correspond to
a Gaussian regime. Mesoscopic time scales can be associated with a transient
regime between the microscopic and macroscopic ones.

It is still an open question the evolution of the PDFs at micro and meso
time scales. In this paper, we investigate the scaling behavior of the return
distributions at microscopic time scales. As shown in ﬁgure 2, the data collapse
into the τ = 1 min distribution, but this stationarity breaks down at τ = 1
hour. This means that the τ = 1 min return distribution functional form is
preserved for several micro time scales, therefore exhibiting a short-time non-
Gaussian intraday quasi-stationary regime.

autocorrelation R(∆t) =< xN

of the measured returns. Employing the standard least-squares ﬁt for time
intervals τ = 2-15 minutes, the semi-log plot indicates a short range exponen-
tial behavior R(∆t) ∼ exp(−∆t/Γ) with characteristic time scale Γ ∼= 4 min.
After ∆t ∼= 20 min the correlation is at the noise level.

to lag ∆t. Employing the standard least-squares ﬁt for time intervals τ = 2-
60 minutes, the log-log plot shows a power-law dependence C(∆t) ∼ ∆t−η
with η ∼= 0.3 along all intraday time lags. This result signals a long-memory
process, without a measurable temporal scale of decay of correlation within the
analyzed regime. These ﬁndings are quantitatively similar to previous results
for the U.S. market [8].

The anomalous diﬀusive process driven by the long and/or short range de-
pendence of price ﬂuctuations can be characterized by the scaling behavior
σ(τ ) ∼ τ H of the standard deviation of the distributions. Through a log-log
plot shown in ﬁgure 4 we estimate the scaling (Hurst) exponent H ∼= 0.7. This
non-trivial scaling exponent is the signature of a super diﬀusive behavior for
the intraday time scales. Actually, it is a stylized fact that the intraday ﬁnan-
cial market generates strong dependence in the consecutive price formation.

3 Non-extensive statistics

The quasi-stationarity property of the microscopic time scale distributions
shown in ﬁgure 2 suggests the search for stable distributions to model them.
Sums of independent or weak dependent stochastic variables lead to Gaussian
or to L´evy limit regimes [9]. On the other hand, the presence of linear and
non-linear dependence found for the one minute returns suggests the search
for stationary distributions in a long memory environment.

Recently, a non-extensive statistical approach that generalizes the standard
Boltzmann-Gibbs theory has been developed, as an attempt to describe non-
equilibrium regimes and/or systems with strong dependence.

The cornerstone of this formalism is the entropy functional Sq[ρ] = −
where q < 3 is a real parameter representing the degree of non-extensivity of
the functional and ρ(x) is a normalized probability density function. The q →
1 limit recovers the classical extensive property. The optimization of Sq under
natural constraints leads to q-Gaussian PDFs deﬁned as:

R

1−

[ρ(x)]qdx
1−q

,

Gq(x, τ ) =

1
Zq(τ ) n1 − β(τ ) h(1 − q)(x − ¯x(τ ))2

io+

1
1−q

(3)

where Zq(τ ) is a normalization constant, β(τ ) is a scale parameter (β−1 is
proportional to the variance of the distribution) and the subindex + indicates
that Gq(x, τ ) = 0 if the expression inside the brackets is non-positive. The

6

usual Gaussian distribution is recovered in the q → 1 limit.

An important property of the q-Gaussian (3) is that, with appropriate time-
dependent parameters β(τ ) and Zq(τ ), it is the invariant solution for a class
of (correlated) anomalous diﬀusive processes governed by non-linear Fokker-
Planck equation of the form [10]:

∂P (x, τ )

[F (x)P (x, τ )] + D

where F (x) = a − b.x is a mean reverting force with b 6= 0. The explicit time
dependence of β(τ ) and Zq(τ ) are:

3−q

where ∆q = 2b−1(2 − q)Dβ(τ0)Z q−1
(τ0). Equation (5) describes anomalous
scaling of the inverse variance parameter β for q 6= 1. In the limit of weak
reverting force and for time scales such that b(3 − q) << (τ − τ0)−1 <<
2D(2 − q)(3 − q)β(τ0)Z q−1(τ0), one gets the result for the free diﬀusion process

(3−q)

Super diﬀusion occurs for q > 1. This is the range of interest of the non-
extensive parameter for application to our intraday data. Hence, parameter q
represents the degree of the resulting anomalous diﬀusion from the underlying
interaction among ﬁnancial trades.

We model the normalized returns at time scale τ by the stochastic variable
x in Eq. (4). Thus, the solutions Gq(x, τ ) describe the empirical distribution
P (xN

τ ).

The mean-reverting parameter a controls the average equilibrium value of
the stochastic variable and does not aﬀect the diﬀusion properties. In our
application for normalized returns, a is set equal to zero. On the other hand,
from (5), the mean-reverting rate parameter b is crucial for the attainment of
a long-time equilibrium solution, but it is worth noting that, as b gets smaller,
the spread of the distributions holds over longer periods and the equilibrium
solution may not be observable.

Substituting the explicit expression of Gq(x, τ ) in (4) it can be shown [12]
that the stochastic variables, whose addition has the q-Gaussian as a limit

7

distribution, are characterized by non-null linear correlation (for b 6= 0) and
non-null higher-order correlations (for q 6= 1). In our application, these step
variables are the one minute normalized returns, which, according to the em-
pirical ﬁndings, are consistent with this modeling with q 6= 1 and b 6= 0, for
microscopic time scales.

4 Non-extensive modeling of the intraday return distributions

It is apparent from the results sketched in the previous section that the q-
Gaussians are good candidates for describing the anomalous diﬀusion of ﬁ-
nancial market indices. Since the correlations are stronger for shorter trading
time intervals, we focus on the microscopic time scales less than one hour (1
min < τ < 60 min).

We determine the parameters of the model by minimizing the mean square
deviation between the empirical distribution P (xN
τ ) and the q-Gaussian dis-
tribution form Gq(x, τ ). This method was applied throughout this paper. The
free parameters are q and β controlling respectively the shape and the width
of the q-Gaussian. In Figure 5(a) we plot the binned empirical distribution of
normalized τ = 1 min returns and the optimal ﬁt. We ﬁnd that the empiri-
cal distribution is well ﬁtted with a q-Gaussian curve within the range xN
1 ∈
[-5,+5] and it is overestimated outside this range. The optimal non-extensive
parameters are q = 1.64 and β = 3.36σ2

We now search for the optimal ﬁt only for the bulk of the τ = 1 min returns,
deﬁned as returns with magnitude less than or equal 5σ1. Figure 5(b) shows
that a good agreement with the q-Gaussian proﬁle is obtained when |xN
1 (τ )| <
5 with q∗ = 1.75 and β = 4.47/σ2
1.

Comparing the above results, we ﬁnd that the inclusion of the tails of the
empirical distributions in the ﬁt has the eﬀect of diminish the optimal q-
value. Nevertheless, the ﬁt at the tails are not satisfactory. Then, for our
non-extensive modeling, we consider only the bulk of the distribution.

To analyze the stability of the market through the elapse time of observation
of our data, we estimate the local parameter q and investigate if it is highly
ﬂuctuating. In ﬁgure 6, we show the time series of the local q parameters
considering the bulk of τ = 1 min returns for each month. From this ﬁgure,
they are roughly constant over the months and are consistent with the optimal
value q*=1.75 for the entire data set. Hence, it is possible to assume that this
parameter is an invariant of the market characterizing the micro time scales.

In ﬁgure 5(a), it was shown a clear deviation of the tails of the distribution
from the q-Gaussian proﬁle. To investigate the tails, cumulative distributions
Pcum(x) of the positive and negative tails for normalized τ = 1 min returns
are plotted in a semi-log space, as shown in ﬁgure 7. The linear dependence of
the graph suggests that the τ = 1 min returns exhibit an exponential decay
in the tails. The straight lines are almost parallel to each other, indicating
that both tails follow approximately the same exponential law Pcum(x) ∼
exp(−(|x| − xC)/ξ) with ξ ∼= 4σ1.

This asymptotic exponential behavior for large returns also emerges as a ro-

in ﬁgure 8, where the distributions exhibit a tent-shape form, when plotted in
a semi-log space.

The q-Gaussians have sharp peaks and power-law tails. For q > 5/3, the

10

q-Gaussian has an inﬁnite second moment. However, for large returns, the
empirical distribution crosses over to simple exponential decay. The exponen-
tial fall-oﬀ implies that the second moment is ﬁnite. These results suggest that
the distributions of high-frequency returns can be modeled by exponentially
truncated q-Gaussian of the form:

In Figure 9 we show that Eq. (8) very well reproduces the distribution of τ
= 1 min normalized returns of the Bovespa index with the ﬁtting parameters
q∗ = 1.75, β = 4.47/σ2
1, ξ = 4σ1 and xC = 4σ1. Note that the value of xC is
consistent with the region |x1| > 5σ1 considered for the tails.

In section 2 it was shown through Figures 3-5 the presence of signiﬁcant corre-
lations of returns at microscopic time lags. It is also important to test the null
hypothesis that the observed correlations cause the persistent fat tails of the
high frequency distributions. In that case, destroying all correlations would
almost vanish the fat tails for larger time scales. With this aim, we random-
ized the empirical series of τ = 1 min returns, by shuﬄing them, creating an
artiﬁcial series. In table 1, we show a comparison between the eﬀective best-ﬁt
parameter q for the empirical (EMP) distributions and for distributions of the
τ -scale returns generated by the aggregation of the τ = 1 min shuﬄed returns
(SHU). While the randomized data have reached the Gaussian regime (q=1)
at microscopic time scales, this regime is far from been reached by the real

11

data in the intraday time scales. This result supports that the scaling prop-
erty observed in ﬁgure 2(a) and the associated slow convergence to the stable
Gaussian distribution are caused by the nontrivial correlations in the market
data.

which includes partially the tails of the distributions when τ > 1 min.

5 Time evolution of the intraday return distributions

In this section, we investigate the stationarity of the central part of the return
distributions at microscopic time scales, shown in ﬁgure 2(a). We now con-
sider the empirical distributions of rescaled returns, this is, detrended original
returns in units of σ1:

xR
τ (t) = (xτ (t) − µτ )/σ1

(9)

We consider the τ = 1 min optimal non-extensive parameter q*=1.75 and
obtain the best-ﬁt parameter β(τ ) for the central part of the rescaled return
distributions at coarser time scales. In ﬁgure 10, we plot the distributions of
ﬁgure 8 in rescaled variables. It is shown that the optimal q*-Gaussians well re-
produce the bulk of the τ -min rescaled return distributions in the microscopic
regime.

The results presented so far lead to the hypothesis of a quasi-stationary q-
Gaussian regime for microscopic time horizon. The presence of the exponential
tails do not aﬀect the q-Gaussian scaling at the centre of the distributions,
which holds over the microscopic time scales due to the presence of strong
correlations.

We now investigate the super diﬀusive time scaling behavior of the empirical
distributions along the same lines of [13]. We test the observed behavior with
the time evolution predicted by the non-linear Fokker Planck Eq. (4) with
q*=1.75.

Fig. 11. Time evolution of parameter β as a function of time scale τ : Bovespa index
data (black squares) and best ﬁt (line) using Eq. (5) with q*=1.75 and τ0= 1 min.
The estimated model parameters are D=0.0286 ± 0.002 and b= 0.025 ± 0.003.

In ﬁgure 11, we model β(τ ) with Eq. (5), where q=q* and τ0= 1 min. There
are two free coeﬃcients left, namely the diﬀusion constant D and the mean-

13

reversion rate b. We show that the empirical values can be well-ﬁtted by the
theoretical values, for particular estimated coeﬃcients D = 0.0286±0.002 and
b = 0.025 ± 0.003. These numerical values are similar to previous results for
the U.S. market [13]. Therefore, our results for the intraday Brazilian market
indicate a time evolution according to the nonlinear Fokker-Planck form.

6 Discussion

The data collapse shown in ﬁgure 2(a) reveals the existence of an invariant
time scaling master curve for the description of high-frequency returns. The
observation of invariant quantities in the economic systems, as in the physical
systems, denotes the existence of conservation laws or same rules governing
these processes.

Moreover, it is known that there is strong time dependence among the tick-by-
tick price formation by the ﬁnancial market traders. In this work, we model
the high-frequency returns of BOVESPA index by considering the q-Gaussian
distributions, which are stationary solutions for a class of anomalous diﬀusive
processes driven by strong correlations.

Adjusting only the central part of the one minute distribution with the q-
Gaussian distribution function, we obtain the optimal non-extensive param-
eter q*=1.75. This value is remarkably constant over the two-year period of
our data, as shown in ﬁgure 6. Similar values (q=1.77 and q=2) were obtained
for the central part of the return distributions for the Japanese [6] and Ko-
rean [14] stock indices, respectively. On the other hand, this value is bigger
than previous ones reported in the literature for the U.S. market [15], which
were obtained adjusting the whole range of the empirical returns. Actually, as
shown in Figure 5, the inclusion of the damped tails of the distributions in the
ﬁt has the eﬀect of diminish the optimal q value, but the observed exponential
fall-oﬀ behavior of our empirical data disable the modeling with q-Gaussians
at the tails, due to their power-law character.

Figure 9 shows that Eq. (8) very well reproduces the distribution of τ =
1 min normalized returns of the BOVESPA index. Exponential tails in the
foreign exchange and stock return distributions have been reported for some
world markets [16,17,18,19,20] for micro and meso time scales, although several
authors have reported power-law decays [21,22,23], including those employing
the non-extensive approach [4,5,7]. Our empirical distributions consist of a
signiﬁcant number of data which allows a fairly statistical analysis including
the tails. The exponential tails may due to ﬁnite-size eﬀects of the ﬁnancial
market, which prevents the development of scaling invariant power-law tails.
This eﬀect is expected to be stronger in the case of emerging markets. This

14

result is also in according to previous ﬁndings for the daily return distribution
tail of the BOVESPA index [18].

We have shown that the index time series in the high frequency regime is a
long memory process where the Hurst exponent is signiﬁcantly greater than
1/2. This long-memory leads to stationary leptokurtic distributions with the
observed scaling behavior of β(τ ) for microscopic time scales. The fast decay
of β(τ ) signals this super-diﬀusive character of the market dynamics.

The anomalous scaling (5) with two free parameters, D and b, reasonably ﬁts
the time evolution of the PDFs at micro scales. This modeling is able to predict
the super diﬀusive behavior of this quasi-stationary regime. The estimated
value for parameter b is small, but signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from zero. This result
is consistent with non-null linear correlation of normalized returns for time lags
∆t < 20 minutes shown in ﬁgure 3(a) and a lifetime of the regime towards the
limit distribution that encompass the microscopic time scales. Recent analysis
of the S&P500 signal [5] also shown that the ﬁrst Kramers-Moyal coeﬃcient
of the FPE is almost zero, indicating almost no restoring force. The stable
non-extensive parameter q∗ > 1 in Eq. (4) implies the existence of higher-
order correlations [12], modeling the non-linear memory eﬀects illustrated in
ﬁgure 3(b). Hence, we conclude that the non-linear Fokker-Planck equation (4)
captures the main features of the dynamical evolution of stock price returns
at this time horizon.

Another dynamical foundation of non-extensive statistics have been applied to
ﬁnancial indices [4,5], in which the price ﬂuctuations are described by Brown-
ian motion subject to a power-law restoring force and a Gaussian white noise
with a slow varying amplitude. This leads to linear FPE for temporal evo-
lution of the distribution function with time-dependent diﬀusive coeﬃcient.
However, if we take into account the strong correlations of the price changes at
microscopic time scales, the description by means of a non-linear FPE seems
to be more appropriate.

The q-Gaussian regime breaks down due to the exponentially truncated tails
that prevent the attainment of the equilibrium solution. On the other hand,
the long-range correlations exhibited by the intraday diﬀusive process further
delay the convergence to the long time Gaussian regime, giving rise to a new
intermediate regime at mesoscopic time scales, in which the q-Gaussian central
part of the distributions are consumed by the exponential tails. This result is
in accordance with previous ﬁndings [17] for probability distributions of stock
returns at mesoscopic time horizons that follow an exponential function.

In conclusion, we found that the intraday stock price ﬂuctuations in Brazil
have an intermediate behavior between the non-extensive q-Gaussian and the
extensive Gaussian regimes characterized by τ -dependent exponential tails

15

of the return distributions. We have shown that a model based on a non-
extensive approach that captures the strong dependence of the stochastic
variable robustly accounts for the observed time evolution of the return dis-
tributions at micro time horizons and reproduces the crossover between micro
and meso time lags. This exponentially damped, non-extensive, dynamical be-
havior should provide a framework to investigate other high-frequency stock
market time series.

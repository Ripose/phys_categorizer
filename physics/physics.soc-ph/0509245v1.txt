Abstract

We study network traﬃc dynamics in a two dimensional communication network
with regular nodes and hubs. If the network experiences heavy message traﬃc, con-
gestion occurs due to ﬁnite capacity of the nodes. We discuss strategies to manipu-
late hub capacity and hub connections to relieve congestion and deﬁne a coeﬃcient
of betweenness centrality (CBC), a direct measure of network traﬃc, which is use-
ful for identifying hubs which are most likely to cause congestion. The addition of
assortative connections to hubs of high CBC relieves congestion very eﬃciently.

1 Introduction

Most communication networks seen in every day life suﬀer congestion problems
at times of peak traﬃc. Telephone networks, traﬃc networks and computer
networks all experience serious delays in the transfer of information due to
congestion or jamming[1]. Network congestion occurs when too many hosts
simultaneously try to send too much data through a network. Various factors
such as capacity, band-width and network topology play an important role in
contributing to traﬃc congestion. The identiﬁcation of optimal structures that
minimise congestion as well as the identiﬁcation of processes that give rise to
such structures have been considered in recent studies[2,3] . However, there
have not been many attempts to improve the performance of communication

networks by making small modiﬁcations to existing networks. It has been es-
tablished that the manipulation of node-capacity and network capacity can
eﬀect drastic improvement in the performance and eﬃciency of load-bearing
networks [4]. Protocols which can eﬃciently manipulate these factors to re-
lieve congestion at high traﬃc densities in communication networks can be
of practical importance. In this paper, we discuss eﬃcient methods by which
traﬃc congestion can be reduced in a two dimensional communication network
of hubs and nodes by minimal manipulation of its hub capacities and connec-
tions [5,6]. We set up a coeﬃcient of betweenness centrality (CBC), which
is a direct measure of message traﬃc [7], and conclude that the addition of
assortative connections to the hubs of the highest CBC is the most eﬀective
way to relieve congestion problems.

2 The model and routing

We study traﬃc congestion for a model network with local clustering[5,6].
This network consists of a two-dimensional lattice with two types of nodes,
ordinary nodes and hubs (See Fig. 1). Each ordinary node is connected to its
nearest-neighbours, whereas the hubs are connected to all nodes within a given
area of inﬂuence deﬁned as a square of side 2k centered around the hub[8].
The hubs are randomly distributed on the lattice such that no two hubs are
separated by less than a minimum distance, dmin. Constituent nodes in the
overlap areas of hubs acquire connections to all the hubs whose inﬂuence areas
overlap. The degree distribution of this network is bi-modal in nature. There
are several studies which examine traﬃc on two-dimensional regular lattices[9]
as well as on two-dimensional regular lattices with nodes of two types, which
are designated as hosts and routers [10]. It has been established that despite
the regular geometry, traﬃc on such networks reproduces the characteristics
of realistic internet traﬃc.

We simulate message traﬃc on this system. Any node can function as a source
or target node for a message and can also be a temporary message holder or
router. The metric distance between any pair of source (is, js) and target
(it, jt) nodes on the network is deﬁned to be the Manhattan distance Dst =
|is − it| + |js − jt|. The traﬃc ﬂow on the network is implemented using the
following routing algorithm.

Since the shortest paths between source and target pairs on the lattice go
through hubs messages are routed through hubs. The current message holder
it tries to send the message towards a temporary target HT , which is the hub
nearest it which is closer to the target than it. If it is an ordinary node, it send
sends the message to its to its nearest neighbour towards HT , or if it is a hub,
it forwards the message to that of its constituent nodes nearest to the ﬁnal
target. If the would-be recipient node is occupied, then the message waits for
a unit time step at it. If the desired node is still occupied after the waiting
time is over, it selects any unoccupied node of its remaining neighbours and
hands over the message.

In case all the remaining neighbours are occupied, the message waits at it until
one of them is free. When a constituent node of HT , receives the message, it
sends the message directly to the hub. If HT is occupied, then the message
waits at the constituent node until the hub is free. When the message reaches
the temporary target HT it sends the message to a peripheral node in the
direction of the target, which then chooses a new hub as the new temporary
target and sends a message in its direction.

CBC values

CBC values for D = 0.05% and D = 4.0%.

3 Congestion and decongestion:

Although the hubs provide short paths on the lattice, hubs which have many
paths running through them also function as trapping sites for messages due
to their ﬁnite capacity. Such hubs can be identiﬁed using a quantity, the co-
eﬃcient of betweenness centrality (CBC), which is a direct measure of net-
work traﬃc and deﬁned as the ratio of the number of messages Nk which pass
through a given hub k to the total number of messages which run simultane-
ously, i.e. CBC = Nk
N .

We plot the distribution of the fraction of hubs with a given value of CBC
against CBC in Fig. 2. It is clear that hubs with low values of CBC dominate
the distribution, and the number of hubs with high values of CBC is very
small. These hubs tend to be potential locations of congestion. Additionally,
the behaviour of many communication networks in real life also indicates that
a few hubs may be responsible for the worst cases of congestion, and the
signiﬁcant addition of capacity at these hubs alone may go a long way towards
relieving network congestion. In order to test this idea, we operate our network
in a regime where congestion is likely to occur.

We compare the performance of the enhancement methods outlined above
for a network of (100 × 100) nodes with overlap parameter dmin = 1 for hub
densities upto 4.0%. The total number of messages Nm = 2000 and Dst = 142.
The length of the run is ﬁxed at 4Dst. The average fraction of messages which
reach their destination and the average travel time of the messages which
reach are measures of the eﬃciency of the network and are calculated over
1000 conﬁgurations. We test the baseline network, where each hub has unit
capacity and can only hold a maximum of one message at a given time, for
its eﬃciency in terms of the number of messages delivered as a function of the
hub density. Table I lists the fraction of messages which reach their target as
a function of hub density. The hub density is listed in column one of the table

Table 1
This table shows F the fraction of messages delivered during a run as a function
of the hub density D. The second column shows F for the baseline viz. the lattice
with hubs of unit capacity and the remaining columns show the fraction of messages
delivered for the case with enhanced capacity CBC, and the case of enhanced ca-
pacity with assortative connections between the top ﬁve hubs (CBCA) and between
the top ﬁve hubs and randomly chosen other hubs (CBCB).

and the fraction of messages which reach the target for the baseline in column
two. It is clear that at low hub densities barely 6 percent of the messages reach
the target.

To check whether the augmentation of capacity at the hubs of high between-
ness centrality relieves the congestion, we augment the capacity of the top
ﬁve hubs ranked by their CBC by a factor of ﬁve (each of the top ﬁve hubs
can now hold ﬁve messages at a time). Column three shows the fraction of
messages which reach the target for this enhanced case. Unfortunately, the
comparison of the second and third columns indicates that the capacity en-
hancement enhances the fraction of messages delivered only marginally. Thus
the enhancement of capacity alone does not relieve congestion very signiﬁ-
cantly.

Earlier studies on branching hierarchical networks indicate that the manipu-
lation of capacity and connectivity together can lead to major improvements
in the performance and eﬃciency of the network [4]. In addition, studies of the
present network [5] indicate that the introduction of a small number of assor-
tative connection per hub has a drastic eﬀect on the travel times of messages.
It is therefore interesting to investigate whether introducing connections be-
tween hubs of high CBC has any eﬀect on relieving congestion. We therefore
add two way connections between the top ﬁve hubs with enhanced capacities
as above (CBCA). The fraction of messages delivered is listed in the fourth col-
umn of table I. It is clear that there is a dramatic enhancement in the number
of messages delivered going from 6% to 66% at low hub densities. Setting up
two-way connections between the top 5 hubs and randomly chosen other hubs
(CBCB) increased the number of messages which were successfully delivered
to 75% (see the ﬁfth column of the table). Thus the addition of assortative

connections to a few hubs of high capacity relieves congestion very eﬃciently.

The quantity N(t), the total number of messages running in the system at
a given time t, is also a useful quantiﬁer of the eﬃciency of the system in
delivering messages, as the number of messages decreases as they are delivered
to the desired target. We plot this quantity in Fig. 3(a) (low hub densities)
and Fig. 3(b) (high hub densities) for the four cases deﬁned above. It is clear
that the addition of two-way connections from the top ﬁve hubs (after capacity
augmentation) to randomly chosen hubs from the remaining hubs relieves the
congestion extremely rapidly in comparison to the base-line at both low and
high hub densities.

3.1 Queue lengths

Another interesting quantity in this context is the queue length at a given hub
as a function of time. A hub is said to have a queue of N messages if at a
given time t all N messages have chosen this hub as their temporary target
during their journeys towards their respective ﬁnal targets. Fig. 4 shows the
queue lengths as functions of time for one of the top ﬁve hubs for the base-line,
CBC and the two cases of CBC with assortative connections. It is very clear
that the assortative connections clear the queues very fast at each of the hubs

by diverting messages along other paths. The queue lengths at several of the
hubs show a peak before they start falling oﬀ, indicating that the messages
start taking alternate paths only after the congestion along the shortest paths
builds up.

3.2 Average waiting times at constituent nodes

We next look at the statistics of average waiting times. According to our
routing rules, a message waits at the constituent node of a hub if the delivery
of the the message to the hub will exceed the capacity of the hub. Thus the
average waiting time, viz. the amount of time, on average, that a message
spends waiting at all the constituent nodes it encounters during its entire
journey, is an important characteriser of transmission eﬃciency. We study the
waiting time as a function of Dst for the diﬀerent strategies. We also include
the waiting time of messages which do not succeed in reaching the target
in this average. When most messages get through, this quantity has a small
value (as at low values of Dst in Fig. 5) but it increases in a nonlinear fashion
with increasing distance. The decrease in waiting times of the CBC and CBC
with assortative connections when compared with the base-line is clear from
the ﬁgure.

4 Discussion

We thus see that the addition of assortative connections to hubs of high be-
tweenness centrality is an extremely eﬃcient way of relieving traﬃc congestion
in a communication network. While the augmentation of capacity at such hubs
can reduce congestion marginally, the data indicates that a large augmenta-
tion of capacity would be required to achieve eﬀective decongestion. Thus the

cost of achieving decongestion by capacity augmentation alone would be quite
high. On the other hand, eﬃcient decongestion can be achieved by the addi-
tion of extra connections to a very small number of hubs of high betweenness
centrality. Decongestion is achieved most rapidly when two-way connections
are added from the hubs of high betweenness centrality to other randomly
chosen hubs. However, other ways of adding assortative connections such as
one way connections, or one-way and two way connections between the hubs
of high CBC also work reasonably well. We note that this method is a low
cost method as very few extra connections are added to as few as ﬁve hubs.
The methods used here are general and can be carried over to other types of
networks as well. Thus, our methods could ﬁnd useful applications in realis-
tic situations. Our network with assortative connections is an example of an
engineered network. It would be interesting to see whether networks can de-
velop such assortative connections by self-organisation mechanisms. We hope
to report on these questions in future work.

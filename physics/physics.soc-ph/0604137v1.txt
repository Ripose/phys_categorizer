The value of stocks varies from day to day, both relative to each other but

also due to collective movements of the overall market. These variations of the

market presumably reﬂect the psychological state of the surrounding society as

aﬀected by current events. One illuminating way to monitor the consequences

of stock market changes is to consider the typical waiting time needed for a

price variation to reach a predetermined level. Through this procedure it has

been found that there is an up-down asymmetry in the market index in the

sense that the time span for a given gain level is about twice that of a loss

of the same magnitude [1]. Surprisingly, this feature is not observed for the

case of individual stocks, which exhibit complete symmetry between gain and

loss waiting times. The key problem thus is to understand how an index, like

the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), can possess a gain-loss asymmetry,

while the individual stocks from which it is composed, do not. To explain this,

we introduce an asymmetric synchronous market model consisting of a number

of randomly ﬂuctuating stocks that occasionally synchronize their short term

draw-downs. These synchronous events are parameterized by a “fear factor”,

that reﬂects the occurrence of dramatic external events which aﬀect the ﬁnancial

market. This model explains empirical ﬁndings, indicating that synchronous

events between (symmetric) stocks are an important ingredient in understanding

the partly asymmetric stock index dynamics. In particular, it demonstrates that

local single stock symmetry and global asymmetry in the index can be explained

by occasional, shortly lived, synchronous draw-downs of the stocks in the index.

An analysis technique based on inverse statistics has recently been applied to study the

variation of stock indices, single stocks and exchange rates [1, 2, 3]. In the time-dependent

inverse statistics approach, one ﬁxes a predetermined level of return (ρ), and, as explained

in Fig. 1(a), asks for the waiting time needed to reach this level for the ﬁrst time. Averaging

over many investment events results in a histogram of waiting times. The DJIA is an

average over 30 of the most important stocks of the US-market chosen from diﬀerent sectors
of the industry. When the gain(+)/loss(−) return levels are set to ρ = ±5%, Fig. 1(b)

shows the histograms obtained for the DJIA daily closing values over its entire 110 years

history. The histograms possess well deﬁned and pronounced maxima, the so-called optimal
investment horizons, followed by long power law tails. These 1/tα-tails, with α ≈ 3/2, are

well understood, and are a consequence of the uncorrelated increments of the underlying

asset price process [4, 5, 6, 7]. However, the interesting observation to be made from

Fig. 1(b) is that the optimal investment horizons of the same magnitude, but opposite signs,

are diﬀerent. More speciﬁcally for ρ = 5%, the maximum occurs after around 15 days,
while for the mirrored (loss) case of ρ = −5% it occurs at about 8 days. Thus the market

as a whole, as monitored by the DJIA, exhibits a fundamental gain-loss asymmetry. Also

other indices, like SP500 and NASDAQ, show this asymmetry [8]. The striking paradox

is that a similar well-pronounced asymmetry is not found for any of the individual stocks

that compose the DJIA [8]. This can be observed from the insert of Fig. 1(b), which shows

the results of applying the same procedure, individually, to these stocks, and subsequently

averaging over them to improve the statistics. The ﬁgure illustrates that single stocks show

inverse statistic histograms that are similar to the DJIA index, but with the important

diﬀerence that there is no asymmetry between gains and losses. How is it possible that the

index exhibits a pronounced asymmetry while the individual stocks do not?

It is known empirically that logarithmic returns of markets as well as individual stocks are

well approximated by random walks [5, 9]. In other words, at long time scales the logarithmic

price displays uncorrelated increments, and is thus characterized by a Hurst exponent close

to the standard value of 0.5 (overlaid by an inﬂationary drift). At very short time scales there

are some deviations from this behavior due to the onset of correlations between the stock

changes [5, 10]. Thus we have to understand how the average of many symmetric random

2

walkers can collectively add up to exhibit an up-down asymmetry for the resulting index. The

prime idea is to introduce occasional synchronous events among discrete random walkers that

mimic the detrended (i.e. corrected for inﬂation [1]) logarithmic price changes of individual

stocks. To this end, we introduce a model consisting of N stocks that, at each (discrete)

time step, can adjust their prices up or down by a certain amount, which for simplicity

is assumed to be constant, but with the direction chosen randomly. Synchronization is

introduced into the model via simultaneous down movements of all walkers at some time

steps. The frequency of such events is given by a “fear-factor” parameter p. Therefore, at

each time step, with probability p all stocks move down synchronously, and with probability
1 − p each stock makes an independent random logarithmic price adjustment. The process is

illustrated in Fig. 2(a). To guarantee that the individual walks behave like standard random

walks without any drift, we compensate the forced down movements with a slight tendency

of up-movements in the calm periods between synchronized downwards events. That is, on a

day without synchronized movements, the chance for a stock to move up q is slightly bigger
than its chance to move down, 1 − q. To ensure the overall balance, the probability to move
up, (1 − p) · q, must equal the probability to move down, p + (1 − p) · (1 − q). Solving

this balance equation allows us to determine the required value of q as a function of p, i.e.
q = 1/[2(1 − p)], which is then used in the model.

The fear factor parameter p reﬂects a collective anxiety state of the investors, likely

triggered by unexpected events. We stress that individual stocks modeled by this process will

exhibit completely symmetric gain-loss distributions as exempliﬁed by the inset to Fig. 2(b).

Through studying empirical ﬁnancial market data, we have found that p typically is of the

order a few percents, depending on the market in question. Fig. 2(b) depicts the inverse

statistics of the model shown in Fig. 2(a). In obtaining these results we used a fear factor
of p = 0.05, N = 30 stocks, and the return level was set to ρ/σ = ±5, where σ denotes

the daily volatility of the index. For the DJIA, the daily volatility is about 1%, and hence

the model value ρ/σ = 5 should be comparable to the ρ = 5% for the DJIA-index used in

obtaining the empirical results of Fig. 1(b).

Fig. 2(b) shows that the model results in a clear gain-loss asymmetry that is qualitatively

very similar to what is found empirically for the DJIA (cf. Fig. 1(b)). In particular, the

empirical peak positions are determined rather accurately by the model, as indicated by the

vertical dashed lines in Fig. 2(b). A detailed comparison of the shapes of the empirical and

3

the modeled inverse statistics curves reveals some minor diﬀerences, especially for ρ > 0

and short waiting times. One could ﬁnd simple explanations for these diﬀerences, such as

the fact that the model does not consider a realistic jump size distribution, or that it does

not include an “optimism factor” synchronizing draw-ups. This would result in a wider

ρ > 0 distribution for short waiting times, and additionally would lower the value of the

maximum. However, we have chosen not to include any of these additional issues into the

phenomenological model, in order to keep it as simple and transparent as possible, and since

it serves well to our main aim, which is to address the origin of the asymmetry.

The comparison between the observed and modeled asymmetry suggests that synchronous

events are relatively frequent. For the analyzed DJIA daily close data, for which we found
our estimated p ≈ 0.05, this corresponds on average to one “catastrophic” event per month,

which is not far from what people or the press typically perceive.

Our model opens for additional investigations into the eﬀects of the many small syn-

chronous events in the market (“mini-crashes”). In particular, we have studied the prob-

ability that the DJIA index goes down, respectively up, over a day and have found that

there is 9% larger probability to go down than to go up. This is in perfect agreement with

the model where the index has a larger probability to go down because of the synchronizing

draw-down events, as quantiﬁed by the fear-factor p. Moreover, we have found overall quan-

titative agreement between the empirical DJIA data and the model (with the parameters

given above) for the probability of moving up/down M consecutive days.

The peak positions in Figs. 1(b) and 2(b) are obviously related to the value chosen for

ρ. As ρ increases, the peaks move to longer times [1], and their amplitudes decrease. In

Fig. 3(a) we show the investment time distributions for the DJIA for four diﬀerent values
of the return levels ρ = ±0.05 and ρ = ±0.07. Note the following interesting results: the

maximum for the gain distribution for ρ = 0.05 and the maximum of the loss distribution
for ρ = −0.07 occur at the same time. This means that by adjusting the gain and loss levels,

one can remove the inherent asymmetry of the market. Indeed, the values of the amplitudes

at the position of the peaks do not agree, but this is to be expected because by increasing

the absolute value of the return level, the index can perform longer random walks and the

corresponding distribution will exhibit a heavier weight for longer times. Figs. 3 shows that

the agreement between the empirical DJIA data and the model is striking.

One might speculate whether the observed asymmetry could be used to generate proﬁt.

It cannot! A call (put) option contract gives the holder the right to buy (sell) and obliges the

writer to sell (buy) a speciﬁed number of shares at a speciﬁed strike price, any time before its

expiry date. If we implemented a strategy based on a put option at current price eight days

from now (corresponding to the maximum loss curve), and a call option at current price 15

days from now (corresponding to maximum probability of gain curve), one can demonstrate

that the expected long term gain is mathematically identical to a straight forward hold

position. Obviously, the cost of buying the options and any additional transaction costs,

would render the use of our observed asymmetry unproﬁtable.

The asymmetry of markets reﬂects an inherent diﬀerence between the value of money and

the value of stocks, where crashes reﬂect the tendency of people to believe in money, rather

than stocks, during crises. In this perspective it is interesting to notice that it is the index,

i.e. the value of all stocks, that is systematically vulnerable relative to the more ﬂuid money.

The buying power of money is complementary to value of stocks [11], and thus exhibits a

mirrored asymmetry with a tendency of an increased buying power for money relative to

index at short times. In periods of fear, people prefer money as the more certain asset, while

calm periods are characterized by random reshuﬄing of agent’s stock assets with a tendency

to push stock values upwards.

We conclude that the asymmetric synchronous market model captures basic character-

istic properties of the day-to-day variations in stock markets. The agreement between the

empirically observed data from the DJIA index and the parallel results obtained for the

model gives credibility to the point, that the presence of a “fear-factor” is a fundamental

“social” ingredient in the dynamics of the overall market.

FIG. 1: (a): Schematic picture of typical stock or index variations (log-price) with time. The

predetermined return levels for gain (blue area)/loss (red area) are set to +ρ > 0/−ρ < 0. The

corresponding investment (waiting) times (τρ) are found by estimating where the horizontal ±ρ

lines cross the logarithmic price curve for the ﬁrst time (tρ), resulting in τρ = tρ − t0. (b): The

right panel shows histograms of the inverse statistics for the DJIA obtained on the basis of the

empirical daily close data covering its entire history of 110 years. The red data points are obtained

using a loss level of ρ = −0.05 and the blue points are obtained using a gain level of ρ = +0.05

and both distributions are normalized. Note the clear asymmetry between the loss and the gain

statistics. The full curves are ﬁts using generalized inverse Gamma distributions [1, 2]. The inset

is the distribution obtained from using the same procedure on the individual stocks of the DJIA,

and then subsequently averaging over the stocks. Now notice that the asymmetry is absent for

individual stocks.

with probability 1 − p (see the text for additional details). (b): The right panel presents the inverse

statistics obtained within this model, for an index consisting of N = 30 stocks and a ratio ρ/σ = 5,

where ρ is the return level and σ denotes the daily volatility of the index. In the model the index

volatility, σ, should reﬂect the observed 1% daily volatility of the DJIA, and the ρ/σ = 5 therefore

corresponds to ρ = 5% in Fig. 1. A fear factor of p = 0.05 was chosen to reproduce the positions

of the two asymmetric maxima appearing in Fig. 1(b) and indicated by bashed vertical lines. As

Notice, that here the asymmetry is absent.

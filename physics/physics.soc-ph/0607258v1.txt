We analyze the ideal gas like models of markets and review the diﬀerent cases where a ‘savings’
factor changes the nature and shape of the distribution of wealth. These models can produce similar
distribution of wealth as observed across varied economies. We present a more realistic model where
the saving factor can vary over time (annealed savings) and yet produces Pareto distribution of
wealth in certain cases. We discuss the relevance of such models in the context of wealth distribution,
and address some recent issues in the context of these models.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The study of wealth distribution [1] in a society has re-
mained an intriguing problem since Vilfredo Pareto who
ﬁrst observed [2] that the number of rich people with
wealth m decay following an inverse:

P (m) ∼ m−(1+ν).

(1)

P (m) is number density of people possessing wealth m,
and ν is known as the Pareto exponent. This exponent
generally assumes a value between 1 and 3 in varied
economies [3, 4, 5].
It is also known that for low and
medium income, the number density P (m) falls oﬀ much
faster: exponentially [3] or in a log-normal way [4].

In recent years, easy availability of data has helped in
the analysis of wealth or income distributions in various
societies [1]. It is now more or less established that the
distribution has a power-law tail for the large (about 5%
of the population) wealth/income [3, 4, 5], while the ma-
jority (around 95%) low income distribution ﬁts well to
Gibbs or log-normal form.

There has been several attempts to model a simple
economy with minimum trading ingredients, which in-
volve a wealth exchange process [6] that produce a distri-
bution of wealth similar to that observed in the real mar-
ket. We are particularly interested in microscopic models
of markets where the (economic) trading activity is con-
sidered as a scattering process [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]
(see also Ref. [15] for a recent extensive review). We
concentrate on models that incorporate ‘savings’ as an
essential ingredient in a trading process, and reproduces
the salient features seen across wealth distributions in
varied economies (see Ref. [16] for a review). Angle [17]
studied inequality processes which can be mapped to the
savings wealth models is certain cases; see Ref. [18] for a
detailed review.

These studies also show (and discussed brieﬂy here)
how the distribution of savings can be modiﬁed to re-
produce the salient features of empirical distributions of

wealth – namely the shape of the distribution for the low
and middle wealth and the tunable Pareto exponent. In
all these models [9, 10, 11, 12, 13], ‘savings’ was intro-
duced as an annealed parameter that remained invariant
with time (or trading).

Apart from a brief summary of the established results
in such models, here we report some new results for an-
nealed cases, where the saving factor can change with
time, as one would expect in a real trading process. We
report cases where the wealth distribution is still de-
scribed by a Pareto law. We also forward some justi-
ﬁcation of the various assumptions in such models.

II.

IDEAL-GAS LIKE MODELS OF TRADING

We ﬁrst consider an ideal-gas model of a closed eco-
nomic system. Wealth is measured in terms of the
amount of money possessed by an individual. Produc-
tion is not allowed i.e, total money M is ﬁxed and also
there is no migration of population i.e, total number of
agents N is ﬁxed, and the only economic activity is con-
ﬁned to trading. Each agent i, individual or corporate,
possess money mi(t) at time t. In any trading, a pair of
agents i and j randomly exchange their money [7, 8, 9],
such that their total money is (locally) conserved and
none end up with negative money (mi(t) ≥ 0, i.e, debt
not allowed):

mi(t) + mj(t) = mi(t + 1) + mj(t + 1);

(2)

time (t) changes by one unit after each trading. The
steady-state (t → ∞) distribution of money is Gibbs one:

P (m) = (1/T ) exp(−m/T ); T = M/N.

(3)

No matter how uniform or justiﬁed the initial distribu-
tion is, the eventual steady state corresponds to Gibbs
distribution where most of the people end up with very
little money. This follows from the conservation of money
and additivity of entropy:

P (m1)P (m2) = P (m1 + m2).

(4)

This steady state result is quite robust and realistic. Sev-
eral variations of the trading, and of the ‘lattice’ (on
which the agents can be put and each agent trade with
its ‘lattice neighbors’ only) — compact, fractal or small-
world like [1], does not aﬀect the distribution.

III. SAVINGS IN IDEAL-GAS TRADING
MARKET: QUENCHED CASE

In any trading, savings come naturally [19]. A sav-
ing factor λ is therefore introduced in the same model [9]
(Ref. [8] is the model without savings), where each trader
at time t saves a fraction λ of its money mi(t) and trades
randomly with the rest.
In each of the following two
cases, the savings fraction does not vary with time, and
hence we call it ‘quenched’ in the terminology of statis-
tical mechanics.

A. Fixed or uniform savings

For the case of ‘ﬁxed’ savings, the money exchange

mi(t + 1) = mi(t) + ∆m; mj(t + 1) = mj(t) − ∆m (5)

rules are:

where

∆m = (1 − λ)[ǫ{mi(t) + mj(t)} − mi(t)],

(6)

where ǫ is a random fraction, coming from the stochastic
nature of the trading. λ is a fraction (0 ≤ λ < 1) which
we call the saving factor.

The market (non-interacting at λ = 0 and 1) becomes
‘interacting’ for any non-vanishing λ(< 1): For ﬁxed λ
(same for all agents), the steady state distribution Pf (m)
of money is sharply decaying on both sides with the most-
probable money per agent shifting away from m = 0 (for
λ = 0) to M/N as λ → 1. The self-organizing feature
of this market, induced by sheer self-interest of saving
by each agent without any global perspective, is very
signiﬁcant as the fraction of paupers decrease with sav-
ing fraction λ and most people possess some fraction of
the average money in the market (for λ → 1, the so-
cialists’ dream is achieved with just people’s self-interest
of saving!). Although this ﬁxed saving propensity does
not give the Pareto-like power-law distribution yet, the
Markovian nature of the scattering or trading processes
(eqn. (4)) is lost and the system becomes co-operative.
Indirectly through λ, the agents get to develop a corre-
lation with (start interacting with) each other and the
system co-operatively self-organizes [20] towards a most-
probable distribution.

This model has been understood to a certain extent
(see e.g, [21, 22, 23]), and argued to resemble a gamma
distribution [22], and partly explained analytically. This
model clearly ﬁnds its relevance in cases where the econ-
omy consists of traders with ‘waged’ income [24].

B. Distributed savings

2

In a real society or economy, λ is a very inhomogeneous
parameter: the interest of saving varies from person to
person. We move a step closer to the real situation where
saving factor λ is widely distributed within the popula-
tion [11, 12, 13]. The evolution of money in such a trading
can be written as:

mi(t+ 1) = λimi(t)+ ǫij [(1 − λi)mi(t) + (1 − λj)mj (t)] ,
(7)

mj(t+1) = λjmj(t)+(1−ǫij) [(1 − λi)mi(t) + (1 − λj)mj(t)]

(8)
One again follows the same rules as before, except that

∆m = ǫij(1 − λj)mj (t) − (1 − λi)(1 − ǫij )mi(t)

(9)

here; λi and λj being the saving propensities of agents i
and j. The agents have ﬁxed (over time) saving propensi-
ties, distributed independently, randomly and uniformly
(white) within an interval 0 to 1 agent i saves a random
fraction λi (0 ≤ λi < 1) and this λi value is quenched for
each agent (λi are independent of trading or t). P (m) is
found to follow a strict power-law decay. This decay ﬁts
to Pareto law (1) with ν = 1.01±0.02 for several decades.
This power law is extremely robust: a distribution

ρ(λ) ∼ |λ0 − λ|α, λ0 6= 1, 0 ≤ λ < 1,

(10)

of quenched λ values among the agents produce power
law distributed m with Pareto index ν = 1, irrespective
of the value of α. For negative α values, however, we
In
get an initial (small m) Gibbs-like decay in P (m).
case λ0 = 1, the Pareto exponent is modiﬁed to ν =
1 + α, which qualiﬁes for the non-universal exponents in
the same model [11, 25].

This model [11] has been thoroughly analyzed, and the
analytical derivation of the Pareto exponent has been
achieved in certain cases [23, 25, 26]. The Pareto expo-
nent has been derived to exactly 1.

In this model, agents with higher saving propensity
tend to hold higher average wealth, which is justiﬁed by
the fact that the saving propensity in the rich population
is always high [27].

IV. SAVINGS IN IDEAL-GAS TRADING
MARKET: ANNEALED CASE

In a real trading process, the concept of ‘saving factor’
cannot be attributed to a quantity that is invariant with
time. A saving factor always changes with time or trad-
ing. In earlier works, we reported the case of annealed
savings, where the savings factor λi changes with time
in the interval [0, 1), but does not produce a power law
in P (m) [11]. We report below some special cases of an-
nealed saving which produce a power law distribution of
P (m).

FIG. 1: Distribution P (m) of money m in case of annealed
savings λ varying randomly in [µ, 1). Here, ζ(µ) has a uni-
form distribution. The distribution has a power law tail with
Pareto index ν = 1. The simulation has been done for a sys-
tem of N = 102 agents, with M/N = 1. P (m) is the steady
state distribution after 4 × 104 × N random exchanges, and
averaged over an ensemble of 105.

If one allows the saving factor λi to vary with time in
[0, 1), the money distribution P (m) does not produce a
power law tail.

Instead, we propose a slightly diﬀerent model of an
annealed saving case. We associate a parameter µi
(0 < µi < 1) with each agent i such that the savings
factor λi randomly assumes a value in the interval [µi, 1)
at each time or trading. The trading rules are of course
unaltered and governed by Eqns. (7) and (8). Now, con-
sidering a suitable distribution ζ(µ) of µ over the agents,
one can produce money distributions with power-law tail.
The only condition that needs to hold is that ζ(µ) should
be non-vanishing as µ → 1. Figure 1 shows the case when
ζ(µ) = 1. Numerical simulations suggest that the behav-
ior of the wealth distribution is similar to the quenched
savings case. In other words, only if ζ(µ) ∝ |1 − µ|α, it
is reﬂected in the Pareto exponent as ν = 1 + α.

V. RELEVANCE OF GAS LIKE MODELS

Al these gas-like models of trading markets are based
on the assumption of (a) money conservation (globally
in the market; as well as locally in any trading) and (b)
stochasticity. These points have been criticized strongly
(by economists) in the recent literature [28]. In the fol-
lowing, we forward some of the arguments in favour of
these assumptions (see also [29]).

A. Money conservation

If we view the trading as scattering processes, one can
in any such ‘money-

see the equivalence. Of course,

3

exchange’ trading process, one receives some proﬁt or
service from the other and this does not appear to be
completely random, as assumed in the models. However,
if we concentrate only on the ‘cash’ exchanged (even us-
ing Bank cards!), every trading is a money conserving
one (like the elastic scattering process in physics!)

It is also important to note that the frequency of money
exchange in such models deﬁne a time scale in which
the total money in the market does not change. In real
economies, the total money changes much slowly, so that
in the time scale of exchanges, it is quite reasonable to
assume the total money to be conserved in these ex-
change models. This can also be justiﬁed by the fact that
the average international foreign currency exchange rates
change drastically (say, by more than 10%) very rarely;
according to the Reserve Bank of India, the US Dollar
remained at INR 45 ± 3 for the last eight years [30]! The
typical time scale of the exchanges considered here cor-
respond to seconds or minutes and hence the constancy
assumption cannot be a major problem.

B. Stochasticity

But, are these trading random? Surely not, when
looked upon from individual’s point of view: When one
maximizes his/her utility by money exchange for the p-th
commodity, he/she may choose to go to the q-th agent
and for the r-th commodity he/she will go to the s-th
agent. But since p 6= q 6= r 6= s in general, when viewed
from a global level, these trading/scattering events will
all look random (although for individuals these is a de-
ﬁned choice or utility maximization).

Apart from the choice of the agents for any trade, the
traded amount are considered to be random in such mod-
els. Some critics argue, this cannot be totally random as
the amount is determined by the price of the commodity
exchanged. Again, this can be defended very easily. If a
little ﬂuctuation over the ‘just price’ occurs in each trade
due to the bargain capacities of the agents involved, one
can easily demonstrate that after suﬃcient trading (time,
depending on the amount of ﬂuctuation in each trade),
the distribution will be determined by the stochasticity,
as in the cases of directed random walks or other biased
stochastic models in physics.

It may be noted in this context that in the stochasti-
cally formulated ideal gas models in physics (developed
in late 1800/early 1900) one (physicists) already knew
for more than a hundred years, that each of the con-
stituent particle (molecule) follows a precise equation of
motion, namely that due to Newton. The assumption
of stochasticity here in such models, even though each
agent might follow an utility maximizing strategy (like
Newton’s equation of motion for molecules), is therefore,
not very unusual in the context.

VI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We analyze the gas like models of markets. We re-
view the diﬀerent cases where a quenched ‘savings’ fac-
tor changes the nature and shape of the distribution of
wealth. Suitable modiﬁcation in the nature of the ‘sav-
ings’ distribution can simulate all observed wealth distri-

butions. We give here some new numerical results for the
annealed ‘savings’ case. We ﬁnd that the more realistic
model, where the saving factor randomly varies in time
(annealed savings), still produce a Pareto distribution of
wealth in certain cases. We also forward some arguments
in favour of the assumptions made in such gas-like mod-
els.

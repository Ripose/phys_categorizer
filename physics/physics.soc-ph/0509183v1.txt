Abstract

In this paper, we studied the research areas of Chinese natural science basic re-
search from a point view of complex network . Two research areas are considered
to be connected if they appear in one fund proposal. The explicit network of such
connections using data from 1999 to 2004 is constructed. The analysis of the real
data shows that the degree distribution of the research areas network(RAN) obeys
two regiments power-law distribution. It displays small world eﬀect in which ran-
domly chosen pairs of research areas are typically separated by only a short path
of intermediate research areas. The average distance of RAN decreases with time,
while the average clustering coeﬃcient increases with time, which indicates that the
scientiﬁc study would like to be integrated together in terms of the studied areas.
The data of 2004 demonstrates that the clustering coeﬃcient of a node with degree
k follows the scaling ﬂow, indicating that the hierarchical organization emerges in
RAN.

1 Introduction

In the past few years there has been a growing interest in the study of
complex networks. The boom has two reasons: the existence of interesting ap-
plications in several biological, sociological, technological and communications
systems and the availability of a large amount of real data [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10].

Recent work on the mathematics of networks has been driven largely by the
observed properties of actual networks and the attempts trying to model them
[11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30]. It also makes sense
to examine simultaneously data from diﬀerent kinds of networks. Recent ap-
proaches with methodology rooted in statistical physics focus on large net-
works, searching for universality both in the topology of the real networks
and in the dynamics governing their evolution [31]. These combined theoret-
ical and empirical results have opened unsuspected directions for researches
and a wealth of applications in many ﬁelds ranging from computer science to
biology and sociology [3,4,5,32]. In this respect, three important results have
been crystallized: First, it has been found that the degree distribution con-
tains important information about the nature of the network, for many large
networks following power-law distributions, inspiring the study of scale-free
networks [33]. Second, most networks have the so-called small world property
[2], which means that the average distance between diﬀerent pairs of nodes
is rather small. Third, real networks display a degree of clustering coeﬃcient
higher than expected for random networks [2,4]. Finally, the assortative mix-
ing is studied to answer why social networks are diﬀerent from other types of
networks [34].

The scientiﬁc study can be considered as being organized within a network
structure, which has a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the observed study collective
behaviors. The viewpoints of complex networks are of interest in studying
scientiﬁc study networks, to uncover the structural characteristics of the net-
works built on RAN. In this paper, the research areas of natural science basic
research is studied from the point view of complex network [35], where the
research areas are deﬁned at the leaf level of the code system. In RAN, the
nodes are deﬁned as research areas. If there is at least one requisition pa-
per ﬁlled in two diﬀerent research areas, there is one edge between the two
nodes, which means that the contents that the scientists studied across the
two areas. Three complementary approaches allow us to obtain a detailed
characterization. First, empirical measurements allow us to uncover the topo-
logical measures that characterize the network at a given moment, as well as
the time evolution of these quantities. The results indicate that the network
is scale-free aﬀected by both internal and external links. Second, the average
distance of RAN decreases with time, which means that the distance between
any pairs of research areas is getting short. Third, the average clustering co-
eﬃcient increases with time, which means that the neighbors of one research
area would like to be connected with each other.

This paper is organized as follows: In section 2, the topological character-
istics of RAN, such as the degree distribution, clustering coeﬃcient, average
path length, assortative coeﬃcient and the relationship between the clustering
coeﬃcient and the degree k are investigated and visualized. In section 3, the
conclusion and discussion are given.

2 Data Analysis of RAN

In this section, the topology and dynamics of the empirical network are
investigated. The parameters that are crucial to the understanding of the
topology of RAN are extracted. The analysis of the data could provide the
development trend of Chinese natural scientiﬁc basic research system.

2.1 Degree distribution follows a power-law

The degree distribution p(k) presents the probability that a randomly se-
lected node has k links, which has been studied extensively for various net-
works. Networks for which p(k) has a power-law tail, are known as scale-free
networks [33,36]. On the other hand, classical network models, including the
Erdˇos-R´enyi model [37,38] and the Watts and Strogatz model [1] have an ex-
ponentially decaying p(k) and are collectively known as exponential networks.
The degree distribution of the data indicates that RAN is scale-free, see Fig.
1 and Fig. 2. There is an elbow value around kc = 10 for the log-log plot
of p(k) of the six years. As there is a lot of scatter, we also determine the
corresponding cumulative distribution pc(k). The latter distribution is ﬁtted
by two diﬀerent exponentials, which is presented in Table 1.

The cumulative distribution implies that the original distribution has also
two exponential regimes [8]. The existence of the threshold kc indicates that
most parts of the research areas have connectivity less than kc and a few
ones have connectivity more than kc. The research areas, which have less
than kc degree, probably lay emphasis on the theoretical study, so they only
connect to limited correlational research areas. The others, which have lots
of connectivity, probably lay emphasis on the application or probably are
new risen research areas. Therefore, they would like to cross many basic and
applicative research areas, such as the intelligence artiﬁcial and the graphic
processing. The network diagram of 2004 is demonstrated in Fig. 3.

data up to the indicated year.

Fig. 4 shows that D decreases with time, which is highly surprising because
most network models so far predict that the average distance should increases
with system size[39,40]. The decreasing trend observed by us could have dif-
ferent origins. It is possible that the increasing interconnectivity decreases the
average distance. In analogy with the social networks, one can say that there
are 3.7 degrees of separation between the research areas.

One can note the slow convergence of the average distance and the more
connected nature of RAN ﬁelds expressed by a smaller separation. The slow
convergence indicats that even longer time interval is needed to reach the
asymptotic limit, in which diﬀerent relevant quantities take up a stationary
value. This ﬁnding provides the theoretical evidence that the scientists tend
to study in crossing areas and the research areas tend to be integrated.

2.3 Average Clustering coeﬃcient increases with time

The clustering coeﬃcient Ci can be deﬁned as follows [1]: pick a node i that
has links to ki nodes in the system. If there ki nodes form a fully connected
clique, there are ki(ki − 1)/2 links between them, but in reality we ﬁnd much
fewer. Denote the number of links that connect the selected ki nodes to each
other by Ei. The clustering coeﬃcient for node i is then Ci = 2Ei/[ki(ki −

5

1)]. The average clustering coeﬃcient for the whole network is obtained by
N
averaging Ci over all nodes in the system C = 1
i=1 Ci. In simple terms,
the clustering coeﬃcient of RAN indicates the probability that two diﬀerent
nodes connect to the same node.

year.

The result, in agreement with the separation measurements, suggests a stronger

interconnection of RAN.

2.4 Average degree increases

The number of nodes of RAN increases with time because of the arrival
of new research areas. The growth of total number of links comes from two
parts. One is the connections generated by new research areas with old ones,
the other is the new connections between old nodes. A quantity characterizing
the network’s interconnections is the average degree hki, denoting the average
number of links per node. The time dependence on hki of RAN is shown in
Fig. 6.

2.5 Assortative Coeﬃcient

The assortative coeﬃcient A measures the tendency of a network to connect
vertices with the same or diﬀerent degrees [34]. If A > 0, the network is said
to be assortative, non-assortative when A = 0 and disassortative when A < 0.
A is deﬁned as follows

possible values of A lies in the interval −1 ≤ A ≤ 1. For RAN we ﬁnd A ≈ 0
in the past six years, so it is a non-assortative network.

ing the recent ﬁndings of Ravasz et. al [30] and Dorogovtsev et. al [29]. The

hierarchical manner into increasingly large groups. In RAN, the relationships
between clustering coeﬃcient and the degree of clustering characterizing from

Fig. 7. Dependence between clustering coeﬃcient and k from 1999 to 2004.

From Fig. 7, one can see that there are no dependence between clustering
coeﬃcient and k from 1999 to 2003, which means that there is no hierarchical
organization in RAN. But the data of 2004 demonstrates that the clustering
coeﬃcient of a node with k links follows the scaling law

C(k) ∼ k−1.

(2)

This scaling law quantiﬁes the coexistence of a hierarchy of nodes with diﬀerent
degrees of clustering. Those at the center of one node have k = 63 and C(63) =
0.04331, while those at the center of the 7-node modules have k = 18 and
C(18) = 0.1972, indicating that the higher a nodes degree, the smaller is its
clustering coeﬃcient, asymptotically following the reciprocal law.

3 Conclusion and Discussion

In this paper, we have constructed a research areas network, named RAN,
and have pointed out that such a network falls into the scale-free and small-
world networks categories. With the observation on the currency section, RAN
has been found to be a non-assortative network. The average distance of RAN
decreases with time, while the clustering coeﬃcient increases with time. This

8

indicates that the scientiﬁc study would like to be integrated together in terms
of the studied areas. The dependence between clustering coeﬃcient and k
indicates that there is no hierarchical organization in RAN from 1999 to 2003,
but the hierarchical organization exists in 2004. In RAN, the small groups of
nodes tend to organize in a hierarchical manner into increasingly large groups.

We hope that the work presented here may stimulate further research on this
subject. Some opened questions are, for instance, whether the results obtained
by RAN held for diﬀerent countries or, perhaps, for diﬀerent departments?
What is the evolving mechanism of RAN?

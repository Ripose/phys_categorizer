Reduction of frustration was the driving force in an approach to social balance as it was recently
considered by Antal et al. [ T. Antal, P. L. Krapivsky, and S. Redner , Phys. Rev. E 72 , 036121
(2005). ]. We generalize their triad dynamics to k-cycle dynamics for arbitrary integer k. We derive
the phase structure, determine the stationary solutions and calculate the time it takes to reach a
frozen state. The main diﬀerence in the phase structure as a function of k is related to k being
even or odd. As a second generalization we dilute the all-to-all coupling as considered by Antal
et al. to a random network with connection probability w < 1. Interestingly, this model can be
mapped onto a k-XOR-SAT problem that is studied in connection with optimization problems in
computer science. What is the phase of social balance in our original interpretation is the phase
of satisfaction of all clauses without frustration in the satisﬁability problem of computer science.
Nevertheless, although the ideal solution without frustration always exists in the cases we study,
it does not mean that it is ever reached, neither in the society nor in the optimization problem,
because the local dynamical updating rules may be such that the ideal state is reached in a time that
grows exponentially with the system size. We generalize the random local algorithm usually applied
for solving the k-XOR-SAT problem to a p-random local algorithm, including a parameter p, that
corresponds to the propensity parameter in the social balance problem. The qualitative eﬀect is a
bias towards the optimal solution and a reduction of the needed simulation time. We establish the
mapping between the k-cycle dynamics for social balance on diluted networks and the k-XOR-SAT
problem solved by a p-random local algorithm.

INTRODUCTION

±

−

Recently Antal et al. [1] proposed a triad dynamics to
model the approach of social balance. An essential ingre-
dient in the algorithm is the reduction of frustration in
the following sense. To an edge (or link) in the all-to-all
topology is assigned a value of +1 or
1 if it connects
two individuals who are friends or enemies respectively.
The sign
1 of a link we call also its spin. If the prod-
uct of links along the boundary of a triad is negative,
the triad is called frustrated (or imbalanced), otherwise
it is called balanced (or unfrustrated). The state of the
network is called balanced if all triads are balanced. If
the balanced state is achieved by all links being positive
the state is called “paradise”. The algorithm depends
on a parameter p
[0, 1] called propensity which deter-
mines the tendency of the system to reduce frustration
via ﬂipping a negative link to a positive one with proba-
bility p or via ﬂipping a positive link to a negative with
p. For an all-to-all topology Antal et al.
probability 1
predict a transition from imbalanced stationary states for
p < 1/2 to balanced stationary states for p
1/2. Here
the dynamics is motivated by social applications so that
the notion of frustration from physics goes along with
frustration in the psychological sense.

Beyond frustration in social systems, within physics, the
notion is familiar from spin glasses. It is the degree of
frustration in spin glasses which determines the qualita-
tive features of the energy landscape. A high [low] degree
of frustration corresponds to many [few] local minima in
the energy landscape.
In terms of energy landscape it
was speculated by Sasai and Wolynes [2] that is the low
degree of frustration in a genetic network which is respon-
sible for the few stable cell states in the high-dimensional
space of states.
Calculational tools from spin-glass theory like the replica-
method [3] turned out to be quite useful in connection
with generic optimization problems (as they occur, for
example, in computer science) whenever there is a map
between the spin-glass Hamiltonian and a cost func-
tion. The goal in ﬁnding the ground state-energy of
the Hamiltonian translates to the minimization of the
costs. A particular class of the optimization problems
refers to the satisﬁability problems. More speciﬁcally one
has a system of B Boolean variables and Q logical con-
straints (clauses) between them. In this case, minimiz-
ing the costs means minimizing the number of violated
constraints. In case of the existence of a non-violating
conﬁguration the problem is said to be satisﬁable, it has
a zero-ground state energy in the Hamiltonian language.
Here it is obvious that computer algorithms designed to
ﬁnd the optimal solution have to reduce the frustration
down to a minimal value. So the reduction of frustration
is in common to very diﬀerent dynamical processes.
The algorithms we have to deal with belong to the so-
called incomplete algorithms [4, 5, 6] characterized by
some kind of Monte-Carlo dynamics that tries to ﬁnd

the solution via stochastic local moves in conﬁguration
space, starting from a random initial conﬁguration. It ei-
ther ﬁnds the solution ”fast” or never (this will be made
more precise below). Among the satisﬁability problems
there are the k-SAT (kS) problems [7, 8, 9], for which ac-
tually no frustration-free solution exists above a certain
threshold in the density of clauses imposed on the sys-
tem. In this case the unsatisﬁability is not a feature of the
algorithm but intrinsic to the problem. However, there
is a special case of kS problems, so-called k-XOR-SAT
(kXS) problems [5, 6, 7, 10] which are always solvable
by some global algorithm, but poses a challenge for ﬁnd-
ing the solution by some kind of Monte-Carlo dynamics,
very similar to the one used for solving the kS problem,
where actually no solution may exist. Now it is these
kXS problems and their solutions that are related to the
social balance dynamics.
In particular it can be easily shown [7, 9, 10] that the
satisﬁability problem 3S (and also the subclass 3XS) can
ﬁrst be mapped onto a 3-spin model that is a spin-glass,
and as we shall show below, the 3-spin glass model can
next be mapped onto the triad dynamics of Antal et
al. [1]. The kXS problem is usually studied for diluted
connections because the interesting changes in the phase
structure of the kXS problem appear at certain threshold
parameters in the dilution, while the all-to-all case is not
of particular interest there.
Dilution of the all-to-all topology is not only needed for
the mapping to the 3XS problem in its usual form. It is
also a natural generalization of the triad dynamics con-
sidered in [1] for social balance. A diluted network is
more realistic than an all-to-all topology by two reasons:
either two individuals may not know each other at all
(this is very likely in case of a large population size) or
they neither like or dislike each other, but are indiﬀer-
ent as emphasized in [11] as an argument for the postu-
lated absence of links. For introducing dilution into the
all-to-all network considered by Antal et al.
it is quite
natural to study random Erd¨os-R´enyi networks [12] for
which two nodes are connected by a link with probability
w. On the other hand, dilution in the kXS problem is
parameterized by the ratio α of number of clauses over
number of variables (variables in the corresponding spin
model or number of links in the triad dynamics). We will
determine the map between both parameterizations.

In the ﬁrst part of this paper (section II) we generalize
the triad dynamics to k-cycle dynamics, driven by the
reduction of frustration, with arbitrary integer k. In the
context of social balance theory, Cartwright and Harary
[11] introduced the notion of balance describing a bal-
anced state with all k-cycles being balanced and k not
restricted to three. We ﬁrst study such model on fully
connected networks (section III). For given ﬁxed and in-
3 in the updating rules, we draw the diﬀerential
teger k
equations of the time evolution due to the local dynam-
ics (section III A) and we predict the stationary densities
k nega-
of k-cycles, k arbitrary integer, containing j

tive links (section III B). As long as k is odd (section
III B 1) in the updating dynamics, the results are only
quantitatively diﬀerent from the case of k = 3 considered
in [1]. An odd cycle of length three is, however, not an
allowed loop in a bipartite graph, for which links may
only exist between diﬀerent type of vertices so that the
length of a loop of minimal size in a bipartite graph is
four. In addition, a 4-cycle with four negative links (that
is four individuals each of which dislikes two others) is
balanced and not frustrated, although it may be called
the “hell”, so it does not need to be updated in order to
reduce its frustration. (To call the hell with four negative
links balanced is not speciﬁc for the notion of frustration
in physics; also in social balance theory it is the product
over links in the loop which counts and decides about
balance or frustration [13].) This diﬀerence is essential
as compared to the triad dynamics, in which a triad of
three unfriendly links is always updated. It has impor-
tant implications on the phase structure as we will show.
For even values of k and larger than four, again there
are only quantitative diﬀerences in the phase structure
as compared to k = 4 (section III B 2).
As in [1] , for odd values of k, we shall distinguish be-
tween stationary states in the inﬁnite volume limit that
1/2) or frustrated (for
can be either balanced (for p
p < 1/2) since it is not possible to reach the paradise in
a ﬁnite time. They are predicted as solutions of mean
ﬁeld equations.
In numerical simulations, ﬂuctuations
about their stationary values do not die out in the phase
for p < 1/2 so that some frustration remains, while for
p
1/2 frozen states are always reached in the form of
the paradise although other balanced states with a ﬁnite
amount of negative links are in principle available, but
are quite unlikely to be realized during the ﬁnite simu-
lation time. They are exponentially suppressed due to
their small weight in conﬁguration space. We calculate
the time it takes to reach a frozen state at and above
the phase transition (section III C 1). For even values
of k we have only two types of stationary frozen states,
“paradise” and “hell” with all links being positive and
negative, respectively. In this case the time to reach the
frozen states at the transition can be calculated in two
ways. The ﬁrst possibility applies for both even and odd
values of k and is based on calculating the time it takes
until a ﬂuctuation is of the same order in size as the
average density of unfriendly links. The second one, ap-
plicable to the case of even values of k, can be obtained
by mapping the social system to a Markov process known
as the Wright-Fisher model for diploid organisms [14], for
which the decay time to one of the ﬁnal conﬁgurations
(all “positive” or all “negative” genes) increases quadrat-
ically in the size N of the system (section III C 2).
In the second part we generalize the k-cycle dynamics
to diluted systems (section IV). The dilution, originally
given in terms of the probability for connecting two links
in a random Erd¨os-R´enyi network [12], is then parameter-
ized in terms of the dilution parameter α, and the results
for stationary and frozen states and the time needed to

≥

∈

reach them will be given as a function of α (section IV A).
The original triad dynamics of Antal et al. with propen-
sity parameter p on a diluted network contains, as special
case, the usual Random-Walk SAT (RWS) algorithm for
ﬁnding the solution of the 3XS problem corresponding
to the choice of p = 1/3 in the triad dynamics. There-
fore it is natural to generalize the RWS algorithm for
generic p
[0, 1] and to study the modiﬁcations in the
performance of the algorithm as a function of p (section
IV B). For the kS problem, and similarly for the kXS
problem, there are three thresholds in α, αd, αs, and
αc with αd < αs < αc. Roughly speaking, the thresh-
old αd corresponds to a dynamical transition between a
phase in which the RWS algorithm ﬁnds a solution in a
time linearly increasing with the size of the system for
α < αd, and exponentially increasing with the system
size for α > αd. The value αs characterizes a transition
in the structure of the solution space, from one cluster
of exponentially many solutions (α < αs) to exponen-
tially many clusters of solutions (α > αs). Finally, αc
refers to the transition between satisﬁable and unsat-
isﬁable kS problems, this means that for these models
not all constraints can be satisﬁed simultaneously in the
UNSAT-phase for α > αc so that a ﬁnite amount of frus-
tration remains. Above this last threshold lies a value of
α, α = αm, such that for α > αm the mean ﬁeld ap-
proximation is justiﬁed that was used for the maximum
value of α in the all-to-all topology of the triad dynamics
of [1]. We shall study the inﬂuence of the parameter p
on the value of αd (section IV B 1) and on the Hamming
distance for α smaller αs or larger αs (section IV B 2).
Moreover we will show how the choice of p changes the
possibility to ﬁnd a solution for the kXS problem (section
IV B 3) and we will determine the validity range of the
mean-ﬁeld approximation (section IV B 4). As it turns
out, the parameter p introduces some bias in the RWS,
accelerating the convergence to “paradise” and reducing
the explored part of conﬁguration space. On the other
hand, an inappropriate choice of p or too much dilution
may prevent an approach to paradise. Fluctuations in the
wrong direction, increasing the amount of frustration, go
along with improved convergence to the balanced state.

II. THE MODEL FOR SOCIAL BALANCE

We represent individuals as vertices (or nodes) of a
graph and a relationship between two individuals as a
link (or edge) that connects the corresponding vertices.
Moreover we assign to a link (i, j) between two nodes i
1, with si,j = 1 if
and j a binary spin variable si,j =
the individuals i and j are friends , and si,j =
1 if i
and j are enemies. We consider the standard notion of
social balance extended to cycles of order k [11, 15]. In
particular a cycle of order k (or a k-cycle) is deﬁned as
a closed path between k distinct nodes i1, i2, . . . , ik of
the network, where the path is performed along the links
of the network (i1, i2) , (i2, i3) , . . . , (ik−1, ik), (ik, i1).

Given a value of k we have k + 1 diﬀerent types T0, T1,
. . . , Tj, . . . , Tk of cycles of order k containing 0, 1, . . . ,
j, . . . , k negative links, respectively. A cycle of order k
in the network is considered as balanced if the product
of the signs of links along the cycle equals 1, otherwise
the cycle is considered as imbalanced or frustrated. Ac-
cordingly, the network is considered as balanced if each
k-cycle of the network is balanced.
We consider our social network as a dynamical system.
We perform a local unconstrained dynamics obtained by
a natural generalization of the local triads dynamics, re-
cently proposed by Antal et al. [1]. We ﬁrst ﬁx a value of
k. Next, at each update we choose at random a k-cycle
Tj. If this k-cycle Tj is balanced (j is even) nothing hap-
pens. If Tj is imbalanced (j is odd) we change one of its
link as follows:
Tj−1 occurs with
if j < k, then Tj →
Tj+1 occurs with probability
probability p, while Tj →
1
Tj−1 happens with proba-
−
bility 1. During one update, the positive [negative] link
which we ﬂip to take a negative [positive] sign is chosen at
random between all the possible positive [negative] links
belonging to the k-cycle Tj. One unit of time is deﬁned
as a number of updates equal to L, where L total num-
ber of links of the network. In Figure 1 we show a simple
scheme that illustrates the dynamical rules in the case
k = 4 (A) and k = 5 (B). It is evident from the ﬁgure
that for even values of k the system remains the same if
(i, j)
we simultaneously ﬂip all the spins si,j → −
si,j ∀
p. The same is not
and make the transformation p
true for odd values of k. The reason is that a k-cycle with
only “unfriendly” links is balanced for even values of k,
while it is imbalanced for odd values of k. The presence
or absence of this symmetry property for even values of
k or odd, respectively, is responsible for very diﬀerent
features in the phase structure. This will be studied in
detail in the following sections.

III. COMPLETE GRAPHS

We ﬁrst consider the case of fully connected networks.
Later we extend the main results to the case of diluted
networks in section IV. In a complete graph every indi-
vidual has a relationship with everyone else. Let N be
the number of nodes of this complete graph. The total
number of links of the network is then given by L =

A. Evolution Equations

In view of deriving the mean ﬁeld equations for the un-
constrained dynamics, introduced in the former section
II, we need to deﬁne the quantity M +
j as the average
number of k-cycles of type Tj which are attached to a
positive link. This number is given by

to a negative link. In term of densities we can easily write

We remark that the only diﬀerence between the cases of
odd values of k and even values of k comes from Eq.s (5)

ence is the main reason why the two cases odd values of k
and even values of k lead to two completely diﬀerent be-
havior and why we treat them separately in the following
section III B.

B. Stationary states

Next let us derive the stationary states from the rate
equations (9) that give a proper description of the uncon-
strained dynamics of k-cycles in a complete graph. Im-

each realization we select at random the values of the
signs of the links, where each of them has the same prob-
ability to be positive or negative, so that ρ0 = 0.5. The

1 with probability 1

As one can easily see, both solutions (13) and (15) are
just binomial distributions. This means that the densi-
ties of a cycle of order k = 3 or a cycle of order k = 5
with j negative links are simply given by the probability
of ﬁnding these densities on a complete graph in which
each link is set equal to 1 with probability ρ∞ or equal
to
ρ∞. (As already noticed in
[1], this result may come a bit as a surprise, because the
3-cycle or here the 5-cycle dynamics seems to be biased
towards the reduction of frustration, on the other hand
it is a bias for individual triads without any constraint
of the type that the frustration of the whole ”society”
should get reduced.)
For odd values of k > 5, a stationary solution always ex-
ists. This solution becomes harder to ﬁnd as k increases,
because the maximal order of the polynomials involved
increases with k (for k = 3 we have polynomials of ﬁrst
order, for k = 5 polynomials of second order, for k = 7
of third and so on). So it becomes impossible to ﬁnd
the solution analytically as the maximal order of solv-
able equations is reached. Nevertheless we can give an
approximate solution using a self-consistent approach as
we shall outline in the following. We suppose that the
general solution for the stationary densities is of the form

) Moreover the ansatz for the stationary solution in the
form of Eq.(17) has the following features: ﬁrst it is valid
for the special cases k = 3 and k = 5, and second, it is nu-
merically supported. In Figure 3 we show some results
obtained by numerical simulations. We plot the densi-
ties mj for diﬀerent values of k [ k = 7 (A) , k = 9 (B),
k = 11 (C) and k = 21 (D) ] and diﬀerent values of p [
p = 0 (black circles) , p = 0.3 (red squares) , p = 0.44
(green diamonds) and p = 0.49 (blue crosses) ]. We per-
formed 50 diﬀerent realizations of a system of N = 64
vertices, where the densities are extrapolated from 106
102
samples (k-cycles) at each realization and after 5
time steps of the simulations (so that we have reached
the stationary state). The initial values of the signs are
chosen to be friendly or unfriendly with the same prob-
ability (ρ0 = 0.5). The full lines are given by Eq.(17)
for which the right value of ρ∞ is given by the average
stationary density of friendly links and the average is
performed over all simulations. Furthermore, we numer-
ically check whether Eq.(17) holds, with the same ρ∞ if
we measure the densities of cycles also of order k′
= k
and moreover, whether it holds during the time while
using the time dependent density of friendly links ρ(t)
instead of the stationary one ρ∞. Since all these checks
are positive, we may say that if at some time the distri-
bution of friendly links (and consequently of unfriendly
links) is uncorrelated, it will stay so forever.

equally likely at each realization (so that ρ0 = 0.5), the dis-
tributions are sampled after 5 · 102 time steps and the system
size is always N = 64. The prediction of Eq.(17) is plotted as
a full line and the value of ρ∞ used is taken from the simula-
tions as the average value of the stationary density of positive

ρ∞ = 0 for p < 1/2 and ρ∞ = 1 for p > 1/2. This is ex-
actly the result we ﬁnd for the case even values of k (see
the next section III B 2), and it is easily explained since
in the limit of large k the distinction between the cases
odd values of k and k even should become irrelevant.
Furthermore it should be noticed that ξ deﬁned in
Eq.(18) is nothing more than a sum of all odd terms of
a binomial distribution. For large values of k we should
expect that the sum of the odd terms is equal to the sum
of the even terms of the distribution, so that

Each point represents the average value of the density of
positive links (after 103 time steps) over 102 diﬀerent re-
alizations. The system size in our simulations is N = 64,
while, at the beginning of each realization, the links have
the same probability to have positive or negative spin
(ρ0 = 0.5). From Eq.(19) we expect that the numerical
results collapse on the same curve ξ(1
2p), de-
pending on the parameter ξ. Imposing ξ = 1/2 [dashed
line] we obtain an excellent ﬁt for all values of p. Only for
small values of p the ﬁt is less good than for intermediate
and large values of p, which is explained by the plot in the
inset of Figure 4. There Eq.(18) is shown as function of p
for k = 3 (black dotted line) and for k = 5 (red full line).

k = 7 (blue diamonds) , k = 9 (violet triangles) , k = 11 (or-
ange crosses) ], as a function of the dynamical parameter p.
The theoretical result, plotted here as a dashed line, is given
by Eq.(19) for ξ = 1/2. This prediction is in good agreement
with the numerical results obtained by averaging the density
of friendly links after 103 time steps over 102 diﬀerent real-
izations. The system size is N = 64. Each simulation starts
with random initial conditions (ρ0 = 0.5). Moreover, as we
can see from the inset, the value of ξ calculated for k = 3 (red
full line) and for k = 5 (black dotted line) is very close to 1/2
for an extended range of p.

2. The case of even values of k

The stability of a k-cycle with all negative links in the
case of even k (see Figure 1) has deep implications on the
global behavior of the model. Actually the elementary
dynamics is now symmetric. Only the value of p gives
a preferential direction (towards a completely friendly or
unfriendly cycle) to the basic processes. With odd k, for
p < 1/2 the tendency of the dynamics to reach the state
with a minor number of positive links in the elementary
processes (involving no totally unfriendly cycles) is over-
Tk−1 which happens with
balanced by the process Tk →
probability one, so that in the thermodynamical limit
the system ends up in an active steady state with a ﬁnite
average density of negative links due to the competition
between the basic processes. Instead, for even k, nothing

7

prevents the system from reaching the “hell”, that is a
state of only negative links, because here a completely
negative cycle is stable. Only for p = 1/2 we expect
to ﬁnd a non-frozen ﬂuctuating ﬁnal state, since in this
case the elementary dynamical processes are fully sym-
metric. Imposing the stationary conditions on the system
we do not get detailed information about the ﬁnal state.
As we can see from Eq.s (7) and (8), for p
= 1/2 the
only possibility to have π+ = π− is the trivial solution
for which both probabilities are equal to zero, so that
the system must reach a frozen conﬁguration, while for
p = 1/2, π+ and π− are always equal, in this case we
expect the system to reach immediately an active steady
state. In order to describe more precisely the ﬁnal con-
ﬁguration of this active steady state, it is instructive to
consider the mean-ﬁeld equation for the density of pos-
itive links. For generic even value of k, it is easy to see
that the number of positive links increases in updates of
T2(j−1) with probability p, whereas it de-
type T2j−1 →
T2j with probability
creases in updates of type T2j−1 →

p, so that the mean ﬁeld equation that governs the

For p
= 1/2 we have only two stationary states, ρ∞ = 0
and ρ∞ = 1 (the other roots of the steady state equation
are complex). It is easily understood that for p < 1/2
the stable conﬁguration is ρ∞ = 0, while for p > 1/2 it
is ρ∞ = 1. In contrast, for p = 1/2 we have ρ(t) =const
at any time, so that ρ∞ = ρ(t = 0) = ρ0. These results
are conﬁrmed by numerical simulations. Moreover, the
convergence to the thermodynamical limit is quite fast,
as it can be seen in Figure 5, where we plot the density of
friendly links ρ∞ as a function of p for the system sizes N
[ N = 8 (dotted line), N = 16 (dashed line) and N = 32
(full line) ] and for k = 4. Each curve is obtained from
averages over 103 diﬀerent realizations of the dynamical
system. In all simulations the links get initially assigned
the values

1 with equal probability, so that ρ0 = 0.5.

C. Frozen conﬁgurations

When all k-cycles of the network are balanced we say
that the network itself is balanced. In particular, in the
case of our unconstrained dynamics we can say that if
the network is balanced it has reached a frozen conﬁg-
uration. The conﬁguration is frozen in the sense that
no dynamics is left since the system cannot escape a bal-
anced conﬁguration. Furthermore it was proven [11] that
if a graph (not only a complete graph) is balanced it is
balanced independently of the choice of k and that the
only possible balanced conﬁgurations are given by bipar-
titions of the network in two subgroups (or “cliques”),
where all the individuals belonging to the same subgroup
are friends while every couple of individuals belonging to

diﬀerent subgroups are enemies (this result is also known
as Structure Theorem [13]). In the case of even values of
k the latter result is still valid if all the individuals of one
subgroup are enemies, while two individuals belonging
to diﬀerent subgroups are friends. It should be noticed
that one of the two cliques may be empty and therefore
the conﬁguration of the paradise (where all the individ-
uals are friends) is also included in this result, as well
as, for the case even values of k, the hell with all indi-
viduals being enemies . In the following we will combine
our former results about the stationary states (section
III B) with the notion of frozen conﬁgurations in order to
predict the probability of ﬁnding a particular balanced
conﬁguration and the time needed for freezing our un-
constrained dynamical process. For clarity we analyze
the cases of odd values of k and even values of k sepa-
rately, again.

III B 1, for odd values of k and p < 1/2, all the k-

ical evolution, if we start from an initially uncorrelated

conﬁguration. In such cases, we can consider our system
as a purely random process in which the values of the
spins are chosen at random with a certain probability.
In particular, the probability of a link to be positive is
given by ρ , the density of positive links ( 1
ρ is the
probability for a link to be negative). The probability
of reaching a frozen conﬁguration, characterized by two
N1 nodes, is then given by

At the transition, for the dynamical parameter p = 1/2
we can follow the same procedure as used by Antal et
al. [1]. The procedure is based on calculating the time it
takes until a ﬂuctuation in the number of negative links
reaches the same order of magnitude as the average num-
ber of negative links. In this case the systems happens
to reach the frozen conﬁguration of the paradise due to
a ﬂuctuation. The number of unfriendly links L−

all links have positive sign and paradise is reached. Other

The derivation would be the same as in the paper of
Antal et al. [1]. It should be noticed that for p > 1/2 the
paradise is reached as soon as k increases. For simplicity
let p = 1 and imagine that the system is at the closest
conﬁguration to the paradise, for which only one link
in the system has negative spin. This link belongs to
R = (N

event we select one k-cycle at random out of M =

For values of 1/2 < p < 1 the k-dependence of τ should
be weaker than the one in Eq.(39), but anyway τ should
be a decreasing function of k. The inset of Figure 6
shows the numerical results obtained for p = 3/4 as a
function of the size of the system N . The freezing time τ
is measured for diﬀerent values of k. We plot the average
value over 103 diﬀerent realizations with initial condition
ρ0 = 0.

2. Freezing time for even values of k

In the case of even values of k and p = 1/2 the master
equation for the density of positive links [ Eq.(20) ] reads
as dρ/dt = 0. Therefore, the density of friendly links,
ρ, should be constant during time for an inﬁnite large
system. In ﬁnite size systems the dynamics is subjected
to non-negligible ﬂuctuations. This allows to understand
the scaling features of the freezing time τ with the system
size. The order of the ﬂuctuations is √L because the
process is completely random as we have seen for the
case odd values of k and p < 1/2. Diﬀerently from the
latter case, for even values of k and p = 1/2 the system
has no tendency to go to a ﬁxed point determined by p
because dρ/dt = 0. We can view the dynamical system
as a Markov chain, with discrete steps in time and state
space, for which the transition probability for passing
from a state with L−(t
1 to a
−
state with L−(t) negative links at time t is given by

So that the probability of having L−(t) negative links
at time t is just a binomial distribution where the prob-

,

cludes both the randomness of the displacement of neg-
ative links and the absence of a particular ﬁxed point
dependent on p. The Markov process, with transition
probability given by Eq.(40), is known under the name
of the Wright-Fisher model [14] from the context of bi-
ology. The Wright-Fisher model is a simple stochastic
model for the reproduction of diploid organisms (diploid
means that each organism has two genes, here named as
“
” and “+”), it was proposed independently by R.A.
Fisher and S. Wright at the beginning of the thirties [14].
The population size of genes in an organism is ﬁxed and
equal to L/2 so that the total number of genes is L.
Each organism lives only for one generation and dies af-
ter the oﬀsprings are made. Each oﬀspring receives two

−

genes, each one selected with probability 1/2 out of the
two genes of a parent of which two are randomly selected
from the population of the former generation. Now let
us assume that there is a random initial conﬁguration
of positive and negative genes with a slight surplus of
negative genes. The oﬀspring generation selects its genes
randomly from this pool and provides the pool for the
next oﬀspring generation. Since the pools get never re-
freshed by a new random conﬁguration, the initial surplus
of negative links gets ampliﬁed in each oﬀspring gener-
ation until the whole population of genes is ”negative”.
Actually the solution of the Wright-Fisher model is quite
simple. The process always converges to a ﬁnal state with
L− = 0 [L+ = L] or L− = L [L+ = 0], corresponding
to our heaven and [hell] solutions for even values of k.

This result is perfectly reproduced by the numerical data
plotted in Figure 7. The main plot shows the average
time needed to reach a balanced conﬁguration as a func-
tion of the size of the system N and for diﬀerent val-
ues of k [ k = 4 (black circles) , k = 6 (red squares)
, k = 8 (blue diamonds) and k = 12 (violet crosses) ].
The averages are performed over diﬀerent numbers of re-
alizations depending on the size N [ 1000 realizations for
sizes N
384 and
128 , 500 realizations for 128 < N
50 realizations for N = 384 and N = 512, and 10 re-
alizations for N = 1024 ]. The dashed line in Figure 7
has, in the log-log plane, a slope equal to 2, all numerical
data ﬁt very well with this line. Furthermore it should
be noticed that there is no k-dependence of the freezing
time τ , as it is described by Eq.(40). This is reﬂected by
the fact that τ is the same for all the values of k consid-
ered in the numerical measurements. Nevertheless there
is a diﬀerence between our model and the Wright-Fisher
model that should be noticed. During the evolution of
our model there is the possibility that the system freezes
in a conﬁguration diﬀerent from the paradise ( L− = 0
) or the hell (L− = L ). The probability of this event
is still given by Eq.(23), with r = L+(N1)/L as the sta-
tionary condition [ L+(N1) is given by Eq.(21) ]. In this
way Eq.(23) gives us P (N1), the not-normalized proba-
bility for the system to freeze in a balanced conﬁguration

values of k [ k = 4 (black circles) , k = 6 (red squares) , k = 8
(blue diamonds) and k = 12 (violet crosses) ] and for p = 1/2.
Each point is given by the average value over several realiza-
tions [ 100 realizations for sizes N ≤ 64 , 50 realizations for
64 < N ≤ 256 and 10 realizations for N > 256 ]. Moreover,
at the beginning of each realization the links are chosen to
be positive or negative with the same probability (ρ0 = 0.5).
The dashed line has, in the log-log plane, slope 2 as expected
in Eq.(41). The inset A) shows the numerical results for the
freezing time τ , for diﬀerent values of k (the same as in the
main plot), as a function of the system size N and for p = 3/4.
Each point of the inset is given by the average over 103 dif-
ferent realizations with random initial conditions. The full
lines are all proportional to ln N as expected. The inset B)
shows the not-normalized probability P (N1) as a function of
the ratio N1/N and for diﬀerent values of the system size N
[ N = 6 (full line), N = 8 (dashed line) and N = 10 (dotted
line) ]. As one can see, P (N1) is extremely small for values
of 0 < N 1 < N already for N = 10.

It is straightforward to see that P (N1) = 1 for N1 = 0
or for N1 = N , so that the paradise has a non-vanishing
probability to be a frozen conﬁguration. Diﬀerently for
any other value of 0 < N1 < N , P (N1) decreases to zero
faster than 1/N . This means that for values of N large
enough it is appropriate to forget about the intermedi-
ate frozen conﬁgurations and to consider the features of
our model as being very well approximated by those of
the Wright-Fisher model.
In the inset B) of Figure 7
the function P (N1) is plotted for diﬀerent values of N [
N = 6 (full line), N = 8 (dashed line) and N = 10 (dot-
ted line) ] with N1 a continuous variable for clarity of the
ﬁgure (we approximate the factorial with the Stirling’s
formula). Obviously P (N1) disappears for 0 < N1 < N
as N increases, already for reasonably small values of N .

IV. DILUTED NETWORKS

In this section we extend the former results, valid in
the case of fully connected networks, to diluted networks.
Real networks, apart from very small ones, cannot be rep-
resented by complete graphs. The situation in which all
individuals know each other is in practice very unlikely.
As mentioned in the introduction, links may be also miss-
ing, because individuals neither like nor dislike each other
but are just indiﬀerent. In the following we analyze the
features of dynamical systems, still following the uncon-
strained k-cycle dynamics, but living on topologies given
by diluted networks.
For diluted networks there is an interesting connection to
another set of problems that leads to a new interpretation
of the social balance problem in terms of a certain k-SAT
(kS) problems (SAT stands for satisﬁability) [7, 8, 9]. In

12

{

xi = 0, 1

such a problem a formula F consists of Q logical clauses
Cq}q=1,...,Q which are deﬁned over a set of B Boolean
{
}i=1,...,B which can take two possible
variables
values 0 =FALSE or 1 =TRUE. Every clause contains
k randomly chosen Boolean variables that are connected
by logical OR operations (
). They appear negated with
a certain probability. In the formula F , all clauses are
connected by logical AN D operations (

W

)

Q

V

F =

Cq

,

q=1
^
so that all clauses Cq should be simultaneously satisﬁed
in order to satisfy the formula F . A particular formula-
tion of the kS problem is the k-XOR-SAT (kXS) problem
[5, 6, 7, 10], in which each clause Cq is a parity check of
the kind

−

≡

≡

(45)

i1 + xq

Cq = xq

ik mod 2 ,

i2 + . . . + xq
so that Cq is TRUE if the total number of true vari-
ables which deﬁne the clause is odd, while otherwise the
clause Cq is FALSE. It is straightforward to map the
kXS problem to our former model for the case odd val-
ues of k. Actually, each clause Cq corresponds to a k-
M ] and each variable xv to a link (i, j). Fur-
cycle [Q
L] with the correspondence si,j = 1 for
thermore [B
xv = 1, while si,j =
1 for xv = 0. For the case of even
values of k, one can use the same mapping but consider
as clause Cq in Eq.(45) its negation Cq. In this way, when
the number of satisﬁed variables xq
i is odd the clause Cq
is unsatisﬁed for odd values of k, while Cq is satisﬁed for
even values of k.
Moreover a typical algorithm for ﬁnding a solution of the
kS problem is the so-called Random-Walk SAT (RWS).
The procedure is the following [5, 6]: select one unsatis-
ﬁed clause Cq randomly, next invert one randomly chosen
variable of its k variables xq
i∗ ; repeat this procedure un-
til no unsatisﬁed clauses are left in the problem. Each
update is counted as 1/B units of time. As one can
easily see, this algorithm is very similar to our uncon-
strained dynamics apart from two aspects. First, in our
unconstrained dynamics we use the dynamical propen-
sity parameter p, while it is absent in the RWS. Second,
in our unconstrained dynamics we count also the choice
of a balanced k-cycle as update event, although it does
not change the system at all. Because of this reason,
the literal application of the original algorithm of uncon-
strained dynamics has very high computational costs if it
is applied to diluted networks. Apart from the parameter
p, we can therefore use the same RWS algorithm for our
unconstrained dynamics of k-cycles. This algorithm is
more reasonable because it selects at each update event
only imbalanced k-cycles which are actually the only ones
that should be updated. In case of an all-to-all topology
there are so many triads that a preordering according to
the property of being balanced or not is too time con-
suming so that in this case our former version is more

6
appropriate. In order to count the time as in our origi-
nal framework of the unconstrained dynamics, we should
impose that, at the n-th update event, the time increases
as

Here α = M/L stands for the ratio of the total number of

the total number of links (i.e. total number of variables).
The parameter α is called the “dilution” parameter, it

i
i=1 M2i−1/L is the ratio of the total num-

tal number of links, in particular α(n−1)
is computed be-
fore an instant of time at which the n-th update event
is implemented. Therefore the ratio α/α(n−1)
gives us
the inverse of the probability for ﬁnding an imbalanced
k-cycle, out of all, balanced or imbalanced, k-cycles, at
the n-th update event. This is a good approximation to
the time deﬁned in the original unconstrained dynamics.
It should be noticed that this algorithm works faster in
units of this computational time, but the simulation time
should be counted in the same units as deﬁned for the
unconstrained dynamics introduced in section II.
The usual performance of the RWS is fully determined by
the dilution parameter α. For α
αd the RWS always
ﬁnds a solution of the kS problem within a time that
scales linearly with the number of variables L. In partic-
ular for the kXS problem αd = 1/k. For αd < α < αc the
RWS is still able to ﬁnd a solution for the kS problem,
but the time needed to ﬁnd the solution grows exponen-
tially with the number of variables L. For the case of the
0.918. αd is the value of the dilution
3XS problem αc ≃
parameter for which we have the “dynamical” transition,
depending on the dynamics of the algorithm while αc
represents the transition between the SAT and the UN-
SAT regions: for values of α
αc the RWS is no longer
able to ﬁnd any solution for the kS problem, and in fact
no such solution with zero frustration exists for the kS
problem. Furthermore there is a third critical threshold
αs, with αd < αs < αc. For values of α < αs all solutions
of the kS problem found by the RWS are located into a
large cluster of solutions and the averaged and normal-
1/2.

In order to connect the problems of social balance on di-
luted networks and the kXS problem on a diluted system

tween the total number of k-cycles of the network and

consider the standard RWS applied to the kXS prob-
lem taking care of the right way of computing the time
as it is given by the rule (46) and the introduction of
the dynamical parameter p (section IV B). In particular
we focus on the “dynamical” transition at αd (section
IV B 1) and the transition in solution space concerning
the clustering properties of the solutions at αs (section
IV B 2). The dynamical parameter p, formerly called the
propensity parameter, leads to a critical value pc above
which it is always possible to ﬁnd a solution within a
time that grows at most linearly with the system size
(section IV B 3). Finally, in section IV B 4 we decrease
the dilution, i.e. increase α to αm such that for α
αm
the system is fully described by the mean ﬁeld equations
of the former sections. We focus on the simplest case
k = 3, but all results presented here for k = 3 should be
qualitatively valid for any value of k

A. Ratio α for random networks

Let us ﬁrst consider Erd¨os-R´enyi networks [12] as a
diluted version of the all-to-all topology that we studied
so far. An Erd¨os-R´enyi network, or a random network, is
a network in which each of the
diﬀerent pairs of nodes
is connected with probability w. The average number

of N = 16, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128, 192 and 256. Each point is
given by the average over 103 diﬀerent network realiza-
tions. In particular these numerical results ﬁt very well
with the expectations (full lines) of Eq.(47), especially for
large values of N and/or small values of w. Furthermore
the critical values αd = 1/3 , αs = 0.818 and αc = 0.918
(dotted lines) are used for extrapolating the numerical
results of wd (open circles), ws (open squares) and wc
(gray squares) respectively [see the inset of Figure 8].

p-Random-Walk SAT

So far we have established the connection between the
kXS problem and the social balance for k-cycles, pro-
posed in this paper. In particular we have determined
how the dilution parameter α is related to diluted ran-
dom networks parameterized by w.
In this section we
extend the known results for the standard RWS of [5, 6]
to the p-Random-Walk SAT (pRWS) algorithm, that is
the RWS algorithm extended by the dynamical parame-
ter p that played the role of a propensity parameter in
connection with the social balance problem. The steps
of the pRWS are as follows:

1. Select randomly a frustrated clause between all

frustrated clauses.

2. Instead of randomly inverting the value of one of
its k variables, as for an update in the case of the
RWS, apply the following procedure:

•

if the clause contains both true and false vari-
ables, select with probability p one of its false

14

variable, randomly chosen between all the
false variables belonging to the clause, and ﬂip
it to the true value;
if the clause contains both true and false vari-
ables, select with probability 1
p one of its
true variable, randomly chosen between all the
true variables belonging to the clause, and ﬂip
it to the false value;
if the clause contains only false values (k
should be odd), select with probability 1 one
of its false variables, randomly chosen between
all the false variables belonging to the clause,
and ﬂip it to the true value.

•

•

3. Go back to point 1 until no unsatisﬁed clauses are

present in the problem.

The update rules of point 2 are the same used in the
case of k-cycle dynamics and illustrated in Figure 1 for
the cases k = 4 (A) and k = 5 (B). For the special case
of 3XS problem, the standard RWS algorithm and the
pRWS algorithm coincides for the dynamical parameter
p = 1/3.

1. Dynamical transition at αd

The freezing time τ , that is the time τ needed for ﬁnd-
ing a solution of the problem, abruptly changes its be-
havior at the dynamical critical point αd = 1/k.
Figure 9 reports the numerical estimate of the freezing
time τ as a function of the dilution parameter α and for
diﬀerent values of the dynamical parameter p [ p = 0 (cir-
cles) , p = 1/3 (squares) , p = 1/2 (diamonds) and p = 1
(crosses) ]. As one can easily see, for p = 1/3 and p = 0,
τ drastically changes around αd, increasing abruptly for
values of α > αd. For p = 1/2 and for p = 1 this drastic
change is not observed. This is understandable from the
fact that both values of p provide a bias towards par-
adise, while p = 1/3 corresponds to a random selection
of one of the three links of a triad as in the original RWS
and p = 0 would favor the approach to the hell if it were
a balanced state. The simulations are performed over
a system with L = 103 variables. Moreover each point
stands for the average over 102 diﬀerent networks and
102 diﬀerent realizations of the dynamics on such topolo-
gies. At the beginning of each simulation the variables
take the value 1 or 0 with the same probability. The inset
shows the relation between the time τ ∗ calculated using
the standard RWS and the time τ calculated according
to Eq.(46). The almost linear relation (the dashed line
has a slope equal to one) between τ ∗ and τ means that
there is no qualitative change between the two diﬀerent
ways of counting the time.

Following the same argument as in [5], we can specify
for the update event at time t the variation of the number
of unsatisﬁed clauses M (u)

time τ needed for reaching a solution increases more slowly
with respect to the case p = 1/3 for α > αs. For p = 1/2
and p = 1 there seems to be no drastic increment of τ for
α > αs. Moreover the inset shows the dependence of τ ∗, the
freezing time as calculated in the standard RWS [5, 6], on the
freezing time τ calculated according to Eq.(46). The almost
linear dependence of τ ∗ on τ (the dashed line has slope one)
explains that there is no qualitative change if we describe the
dynamical features of the system in terms of τ or τ ∗ as time
used by the simulations.

2. Clustering of solutions at αs

In order to study the transition in the clustering struc-
ture of solutions at αs, we numerically determine the
Hamming distance between diﬀerent solutions of the
same problem. More precisely, given a problem of L vari-
r=1,...,T
ables and M clauses, we ﬁnd T solutions
i=1,...,L of
the given problem. This means that we start T times
from a random initial conﬁguration and at each time we
perform a pRWS until we end up with a solution. We
then compute the distance between these T solutions as

tween solutions as a function of the ratio α and diﬀerent val-
ues of the dynamical parameter p [ p = 0 (circles) , p = 1/3
(squares) , p = 1/2 (diamonds) and p = 1 (crosses)]. For
the standard RWS (p = 1/3) the distance drops down around
the critical point αs. Diﬀerent values of p perform not-really
random walks and lead to eﬀective values of αs smaller than
the former one. The inset shows the dependence of hdi on the
dynamical parameter p. As it is shown for diﬀerent values of
α [α = 0.3 (full line) , α = 0.5 (dotted line) and α = 0.85
(dashed line)] the peak of the distance between solutions is
for a pRWS which is really random, that is for p = 1/3. All
the points here , in the main plot as well as in the inset, are
obtained for a system of L = 20 variables. Each point is ob-
tained averaging over 102 diﬀerent networks and on each of
these networks the average distance is calculated over 102 so-
lutions. At the beginning of each simulation the value of one
variable is chosen to be 1 or 0 with equal probability.

The numerical results for L = 20 are reported in Fig-

and over 102 diﬀerent problems for each value of α. As
expected for p = 1/3 [squares] the distance between so-
lutions drops down around αs (actually it drops down
before αs because of the small number of variables). For
diﬀerent values of p [ p = 0 (circles) , p = 1/2 (diamonds)
and p = 1 (crosses) ], the pRWS is less random and

3. SAT/UNSAT transition at αc

L
k

≫

Diﬀerently from the general kS problem, the kXS prob-
lem is known to be always solvable [6] and the solution
corresponds to one of the balanced conﬁgurations as de-
scribed in section III C for the all-to-all topology. Nev-
ertheless the challenge is whether the solutions can be
found by a local random algorithm like RWS. In the ap-
plication of the RWS it can happen that the algorithm is
not able to ﬁnd one of these solutions in a “ﬁnite” time,
so that the problem is called “unsatisﬁed”. The notion
is made more precise in [10]. For practical reasons the
way of estimating the critical point αc that separates the
SAT from the UNSAT region is related to the so-called
algorithm complexity of the RWS. Here we follow the
prescription of [5, 6, 17]. Fixed k = 3 and calling a RWS
with initial random assignment of the variables followed
by 3L update events one trial, one needs a total number
(4/3)L for being “numerically” sure to be
of trials T
in the UNSAT region. In fact if after T trials no solution
is found, the problem is considered as “unsatisﬁed” .
The introduction of the dynamical parameter p can
strongly “improve” the performance of RWS. For p
= 1/3
the pRWS updates the variables following a well pre-
scribed direction: the tendency is to increases the num-
ber of negative variables for p < 1/3 and to decrease their
number for p > 1/3. In particular, as we have seen in
the former sections, for p
1/2 the pRWS approaches
≥
the conﬁguration of the paradise for the largest value of
Lβ, so
α =
that there is no UNSAT region at all if we apply the for-
mer criterion for the numerical estimate of the UNSAT
region. Clearly, if the bias goes in the wrong direction,
the performance gets worse.
In this section we brieﬂy give a qualitative description
about the SAT/UNSAT region for the pRWS due to the
dynamical parameter p. Let us deﬁne as +pc [−pc] the
minimum [maximum] value of p for which the system
can be satisﬁed. Given a problem with αL clauses we
follow the algorithm: 1) Set p = 1 [p = 0] ; 2) set an
initial random conﬁguration and apply the pRWS ; 3)
if the pRWS ﬁnds the solution in a number of updates
less than U
L , decrease [increase] p and go to point 2)
; 4) if not +pc = p [−pc = p]. This procedure can be
performed up to the desired sensitivity for the numerical
estimate of +pc [−pc]. The idea of deﬁning an upper +pc
and lower critical value −pc for the dynamical parameter
p is related to the fact that for p = 1/3 the pRWS has
most trouble to ﬁnd the solution. Figure 12B and Fig-
ure 12C show the numerical results for +pc and −pc as
a function of the dilution parameter α. The number of
variables is L = 103. We report the results for diﬀerent
values of the waiting time T = L
U [ U = 1 (circles) ,
U = 2 (squares) , U = 3 (crosses) , U = 10 (crosses) ].
Each point is averaged over 10 diﬀerent problems and 10
diﬀerent pRWS applied to each problem. Qualitatively
it is seen that for α
αd the problem is always solvable
( +pc = 0 and −pc = 1 ) , while for α > αd one needs

p. We used diﬀerent waiting times [ U = 1 (circles) , U = 2

p
values for +pc and −pc depend on the waiting time until
the pRWS reaches a solution. Here, for simplicity we do
not wait long enough for seeing a similar behavior around
αc instead of αd. Furthermore, in Figure 12A we report
the probability P , that is the ratio of success over the
number of trials, for solving the problem as a function
of p for α = αc. The waiting time is U = 1 (circles) ,
U = 2 (squares) , U = 3 (diamonds) , U = 10 (crosses)
and U = 100 (triangles), respectively. The probabilities
are calculated over 102 trials for each point (10 diﬀerent
problems times 10 pRWS for each problem). As the wait-
ing time increases the upper critical value +pc for ﬁnding
for sure the solution decreases ( +pc ≃
0.8 for U = 1 ,
+pc ≃
0.7 for U = 2 , +pc ≃
0.6 for U = 3 and for U = 10
, +pc ≃
0.5 for U = 100 ). This means that even for less
biased search, solutions can be found, while −pc is zero
for the waiting time reported here, no value of p < pc
leads to a solution. This is as expected. If the variables
are almost all negative it is harder to ﬁnd a solution of
the problem (the paradise is a solution while the hell for
k odd is not).

as the average of the density of friendly links (registered

the stationary density) over 50 diﬀerent problems and 50
diﬀerent pRWS for each problem. The results reported
here are for L = 128 (open symbols) and L = 256 (gray
ﬁlled symbols) and for diﬀerent values of p [ p = 0 (cir-
cles) , p = 1/3 (squares) , p = 1/2 (diamonds) , p = 1
(triangles) ]. The initial conditions are those of an an-
tagonistic society. The dashed lines are proportional to
e−3α. Figure 14 shows that the mean-ﬁeld approxima-
tion of Eq.(14) becomes exponentially fast true as the
system dilution decreases. Moreover, as for the cases
p = 0 and p = 1/3, we can observe that the diﬀerence
(m)ρ∞ −
is always smaller than for p = 1/2 and
p = 1. Qualitatively this means that the dilution α of
(cid:12)
the system needed to reach the theoretical expectation
(cid:12)
of Eq.(14) is smaller than αm for p < 1/2. In general we
can say that αm is a function of p: αm = αm(p), and αm
is the minimum value of the dilution of the system for
which we can eﬀectively describe the diluted system as
an all-to-all system for all the values of p. Moreover, it
should be noticed that for α > αm almost all variables
belong to at least three clauses [ see Figure 13 ]. This
fact allows the pRWS to explore a larger part of conﬁg-
uration space. Let us assume that one variable belongs
to less than three clauses: an eventual update event that
ﬂips this variable so that the one triad becomes balanced,
can never increase the number of unsatisﬁed clauses by
frustrating other clauses it belongs to. This reminds us
to the situation in an energy landscape in which an al-
gorithm gets stuck in a local minimum when it never
accepts a change in the “wrong” direction, i.e. towards
larger energy.

V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In the ﬁrst part of this paper we generalized the triad
dynamics of Antal et al. to a k-cycle dynamics [1]. Here
we had to distinguish the cases of even values of k and
odd values of k. For all values of integer k there is again
a critical threshold at pc = 1/2 in the propensity pa-
rameter. For odd k and p < pc the paradise can never
be reached in the thermodynamic limit of inﬁnite system
size (as predicted by the mean ﬁeld equations which we
solved exactly for k = 5 and approximately for k > 5).
In the ﬁnite volume, in principle one could reach a bal-
anced state made out of two cliques (a special case of
this conﬁguration is the “paradise” when one clique is
empty). However, the probability for reaching such type
of frozen state decreases exponentially with the system
size so that in practice the ﬂuctuations never die out in
the numerical simulations. For p > 1/2 the convergence
time to reach the paradise grows logarithmically with
the system size. At p = 1/2 paradise is reached within
a time that follows a power law in the size N , where we

determined the k-dependence of the exponent. In partic-
ular, the densities of k-cycles with j negative links, here
evolved according to the rules of the k-cycle dynamics,
could be equally well obtained from a random dynamics
in which each link is set equal to 1 with probability ρ∞
or equal to
ρ∞. This feature was
already observed by Antal et al. for k = 3 [1]. It means
that the individual updating rules which seem to be “so-
cially” motivated in locally reducing the social tensions
by changing links to friendly ones, end up with random
distributions of friendly links. The reason is a missing
constraint of the type that the overall number of frus-
trated k-cycles should not increase in an update event.
Such a constrained dynamics was studied by Antal et al.
in [1], but not in this paper.
For even values of k, the only stable solutions are
“heaven” (i.e. paradise) and “hell” for p > 1/2 and
p < 1/2, respectively, and the time to reach these
frozen conﬁgurations grows logarithmically with N . At
pc = 1/2 other realizations of the frozen conﬁgurations
are possible, in principle. However, they have negligi-
ble probability as compared to heaven and hell. Here the
time to reach these conﬁgurations increases quadratically
in N , independently of k. This result was obtained in two
ways. Either from the criterion to reach the stable state
when a large enough ﬂuctuation drops the system into
this state (so we had to calculate how long one has to
wait for such a big ﬂuctuation). Alternatively, the result
could be read oﬀ from a mapping to a Markov process for

−

diploid organisms ending up in a genetic pool of either
all “+”-genes or all “
”-genes. The diﬀerence in the pos-
sible stable states of diploid organisms and ours consists
in two-clique stable solutions that are admissible for the
even k-cycle dynamics, in principle, however such clique
states have such a low probability of being realized that
the diﬀerence is irrelevant.
The diﬀerence in the exponent at pc and the stable con-
ﬁgurations above and below pc between the even and odd
k-cycle dynamics was due to the fact that ”hell”, a state
with all links negative as in an antagonistic society, is
a balanced state for even k, not only by the frustration
criterion of physicists, but also according to the criterion
of social scientists [11].

−

As a second natural generalization of the social balance
dynamics of Antal et al. we considered a diluted network.
One way of implementing the dilution is via a random
Erd¨os-R´enyi network, characterized by the probability w
for connecting a randomly chosen pair of nodes. Here
we focused our studies to the case k = 3. The mean-
ﬁeld description and the results about the phase struc-
ture remain valid down to a certain degree of dilution,
characterized by wm. This threshold for the validity of
the mean-ﬁeld description practically coincides with the
criterion whether a single link belongs to at least three
triads (for w > wm) or not (w < wm). If it does so, an up-
date event can increase the number of frustrated triads.
For w < wm, or more precisely w < wd < wm it becomes
easier to realize frozen conﬁgurations diﬀerent from the
paradise. Isolated links do not get updated at all and iso-
lated triads can freeze to a “+”-“
”-conﬁguration. The
time to reach such a frozen conﬁguration (in general dif-
ferent from the paradise) grows then only linearly in the
system size. Also the solution space, characterized by the
average Hamming distance between solutions, has diﬀer-
ent features below and above another threshold, called
ws with wd < ws < wm. Therefore one of the main dif-
ferences between the all-to-all and the suﬃciently diluted
topology are the frozen conﬁgurations. For the all-to-all
case we observed the paradise above pc for odd values
of k and even values of k and the hell for even values
of k below pc, in the numerical simulations, because the
probability to ﬁnd a two-clique-frozen conﬁguration was
calculated to be negligibly small. For larger dilution, also
other balanced conﬁgurations were numerically found, as
mentioned above, and the time passed in the numerical
simulations for ﬁnding these solutions followed the theo-
retical predictions.
In section IV we used, however, another parameteriza-
tion in terms of the dilution parameter α, that was the
ratio of triads (clauses) over the number of links [we gave
anyway an approximated relation between α and w in
Eq.(47)]. The reason for using this parameterization was
a mapping of the k-cycle social balance of networks to a k-
XOR-SAT (kXS) problem, that is a typical satisﬁability
problem in optimization tasks. We also traced a mapping
between the “social” dynamical rules and the Random-

19

Walk SAT (RWS) algorithm, that is one approach for
solving this problem in a random local way. As we have
shown, the diluted version of the 3-cycle social dynam-
ics with propensity parameter p = 1/3 corresponds to a
3XS problem solved by the RWS algorithm in its stan-
dard form (as used in [5, 6]).
The kXS problem is always solvable like the k-cycle so-
cial balance, for which a two cliques solution always exists
due to the structure theorem of [11], containing as a spe-
cial solution the so-called paradise. The common chal-
lenge, however, is to ﬁnd this solution by a local stochas-
tic algorithm. The driving force, shared by both sets of
problems, is the reduction of frustration. The meaning
of frustration depends on the context:
for the k-cycle
dynamics it is meant in a social sense as a reduction of
social tension, for the kXS problem it corresponds to vi-
olated clauses. The mathematical criterion is the same.
The local stochastic algorithm works in a certain param-
eter range, but outside this range it fails. The paradise
is never reached for a propensity parameter p < 1/2,
independently of k. Similarly, the solution of the kXS
problem is never found if the dilution parameter is larger
than αc, and the RWS algorithm needs an exponentially
long time already for α > αd, with αd < αc.
We generalized the RWS algorithm, usually chosen for
solving the k-SAT (kS) problem as well as the kXS prob-
lem, to include a parameter p that played formerly the
role of the propensity parameter in the social dynamics
(pRWS). The eﬀect of this parameter is a bias towards
the solution so that αd, the threshold between a linear
and an exponential time for solving the problem, becomes
a function of p. Problems for which the pRWS algorithm
needed exponentially long for p = 1/3, now become solv-
able within a time that grows less than logarithmically
in the system size for p > 1/2 and less than power-like
in the system size for p = 1/2. Along with the bias
goes an exploration of solution space that has on average
a smaller Hamming distance between diﬀerent solutions
than in the case of the 1
3 RWS algorithm that was for-
merly considered [5, 6].

Our paper has illustrated that the reduction of frustra-
tion may be the driving force in common to a number
of dynamical systems. So far we were concerned about
“artiﬁcial” systems like social systems and satisﬁability
problems. It would be interesting to search for natural
networks whose evolution was determined by the goal of
reducing the frustration, not necessarily to zero degree,
but to a low degree at least.

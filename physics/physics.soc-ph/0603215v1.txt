Computer simulation of language competition by physicists

Abstract:
Computer simulation of languages is an old subject, but since the paper
of Abrams and Strogatz (2003) several physics groups independently took up
this ﬁeld. We shortly review their work and bring more details on our own
simulations.

1 Introduction

Human languages dististinguish us from other animals, but also birds or ants
have systems of communication. Also, humans have invented alphabets and
other formalized forms of writings. In principle the methods to be described
here could be applied also to these other forms of communication, but mostly
we are interested here in the presently about 104 diﬀerent human languages
on this planet[1]. We leave it to linguists to distinguish languages from
dialects or language families; when we mention ”language” readers may read
dialect or family instead.

Everyday language contains thousands of words for diﬀerent aspects of
life, and with the special words of science, medicine, . . . we get much more.
For the same concept of everyday life, each diﬀerent language in general has
a diﬀerent word, and thus the number of possible languages is enormous and
diﬃcult to simulate. Things become easier if we look only at grammar; do
we order (subject, object, verb) or (subject, verb, object) or . . .? Briscoe [2]
mentioned about 30 independent binary grammatical choices, which leads
to a manageable 230 ≃ 109 possible languages, which can be symbolized by
a string of ℓ = 30 bits. Thus many of the simulations described here use
bit-strings with ℓ = 8, 16 . . . 64.

The present situation is not in equilibrium; about every ten days a human
language dies out, and in Brazil already more than half of the indigenous
languages have vanished as a result of the European conquest. On the other
hand, Latin has split in the last two millennia into several languages, from

1

Portuguese to Romanian, and many experts believe that Latin and the other
Indo-European languages spoken 600 years ago from Iceland to Bengal (and
now also in the Americas, Australia, Africa) have originated from the people
who invented agriculture in the Konya plane of Turkey, 104 years ago. Thus
similar to biology, also languages can become extinct or speciate into several
daughter languages.

In contrast to biology, humans do not eat humans of other languages as
regular food, and thus one does not have a complex ecosystem of predators
eating prey as in biology. Instead, languages are meant for communication,
and thus there is a tendency of only one language dominating in one region,
like German in Germany etc. Will globalisation lead to all of us speaking
one language in the distant future? For physics research, that situation has
already arrived many years ago. If we follow the Bible, then at the beginning
Adam and Eve spoke one language only, and only with the destruction of
the Tower of Babel diﬀerent languages originated.

Thus in the history mankind we may have had ﬁrst a rise, and later a
decay, in the number of diﬀerent languages spoken. In Papua New Guinea
[3] there are now 103 languages, each spoken by about 103 people; can this
situation survive if television and mobile phones become more widespread
there?

While we cannot answer these questions, we can at least simulate such
”survival of the ﬁttest” among languages, in a way similar but not identical
to biology. We will not emphasize here the longer history of computer sim-
ulations of how children learn a language [4], see also [5], or how mankind
developed the very ﬁrst language out of ape sounds[6]. Instead we talk about
the competition between diﬀerent languages for adults. And we will empha-
size the ”agent-based” models simulating individuals, analogous to Monte
Carlo and Molecular Dynamics for spins and molecules

The second section deals with diﬀerential equations (a method we regard
as outdated), followed by agent-based simulations with few languages in sec-
tion 3 and with many languages in section 4. Further results from the two
many-language models are given in the appendix.

2 Diﬀerential equations

Already Nettle [7] suggested a very simple diﬀerential equation to see how
the number L of languages changes with time:

dL/dt = 70/t − L/20

Here the time unit is thousand years. (Actually L is the number of diﬀerent
language groups, and time is discrete). The second term on the RHS means
a loss of ﬁve percent per millennium; the ﬁrst term indicates the formation
of new languages which became more diﬃcult when the population became
higher since then the higher demand for communication reduced the chances
of new languages to develop. The aim was to explain why the recently

with their older human population. For long times, this diﬀerential equation
means that L decays exponentially towards zero.

tually they apply this equation to the learning of languages or grammars by
children; the interpretation for competition between adult languages is ours.)
Here the ﬁtness fi = Pj Fijxj of language i is determined by the degree Fij
to which a speaker of language i is understood by people speaking language
j. The average ﬁtness is φ = Pi fixi and is subtracted to keep the sum

over all fractions xj independent of time. The probability that children from
i-speaking parents later speak language j is Qij.

For a large number L of languages, there are numerous free parameters
in the matrices Qij and Fij. With most of them the same one ﬁnds a sharp
phase transition [4] as a function of mutation rates Qij. If one starts with
only one language, then at low mutation rates most of the people still speak
this language and only a minority has switched to other languages. For in-
creasing mutation rates, suddenly the system jumps from this dominance of
one language to a fragmentation state where all languages are spoken equally
often. If, in turn, we start from such a fragmented state then it stays frag-
mented at high mutation rates. With decreasing mutation rates it suddenly
jumps to the dominance of one language (numerically, one then has to give
this one language a very slight advantage). The two jumps do not occur at
the same mutation rate but show hysteresis: Starting with dominance and

5

increasing the mutation rate allows dominance for higher mutation rates then
when we start with fragmentation and decrease the mutation rate.

Qualitatively these properties remain if the many matrix elements are
selected randomly instead of being the same [8] except that the hysteresis
has become very small. Fig.1 shows the case where we start with dominance
and looks similar to the case where we start with fragmentation. The time
development for two of the 30 simulated languages is shown for two slightly
diﬀerent mutation rates, and we see how for the lower mutation rate but
not for the higher rate one of the two languages starts to dominate, at the
expense of the other.

These 30 languages are more mathematical exercises, but Fig.2 applies
these methods to up to L = 8000 languages, using two 8000 × 8000 random
matrices F and Q. We show the size distribution of languages, where the
size is the fraction of people speaking this language. On this log-log plot
we see roughly parabolas, shifting to the left with increasing number L of
languages. These parabolas correspond to log-normal distributions, roughly
as observed empirically in Fig.3.

(Similar to Komarova [4] we assume the average F to be 0.3 except for
Fii = 1 and the average Q to be p/(L − 1) except Qii = 1 − p; the actual
values are selected randomly between zero and twice their average.)

There are two problems in this comparison of Figures 2 and 3: In these
simulations, the (logarithmic) range over which the language sizes vary is
quite small and does not change with increasing L. And the real distribu-
tion is unsymmetric, having higher values for small languages [9] than the
log-normal distribution; this enhancement is missing in the simulation of
Fig.2. Finally, we cheated: Fig.2 was taken in the dominance regime and the
dominating language was ignored in the statistics.

Much more attractive for physicists was the one-page paper of Abrams
and Strogatz [10] which was within weeks followed by a poster of Patriarca
and Leppanen [11]. This pair of papers then triggered apparently indepen-
dent research in Spain [12], Greece [13], Germany [14], Argentina [15] and at
two diﬀerent places in Brazil [16, 17], all on language competition.

The Abrams-Strogatz diﬀerential equation for the competition of a lan-
guage Y with higher social status 1 − s against another language X with
lower social status s is

dx/dt = (1 − x)xas − x(1 − x)a(1 − s)

where a ≃ 1.3 and 0 < s ≤ 1/2. Here x is the fraction in the population

speaking language X with lower social status s while the fraction 1−x speaks
language Y. Figure 4 with no status diﬀerence, s = 1/2, shows as intended
that language to win which is initially in the majority; the other language
dies out. For x(t = 0) < 1/2 the language Y wins and for x(t = 0) > 1/2
the language X wins. This is highly plausible: If we would immigrate to
Brazil where in most places most of the people speak Portuguese, then also
we would have to learn Portuguese, not because of status but because of
numbers. If the initial minority language has the higher status, as happened
500 years ago when Portuguese ships landed in Brazil, then it may win at
the end, thanks to guns, writing, and other status aspects, as is the case in
Brazil. Figures for unequal status are published in [8].

The Finnish group [11] generalized this simple diﬀerential equation to

a square lattice, where it became a partial diﬀerential equation including a
Laplacian ∇2x(r). Then having in one part of the lattice a higher status
for X compared to Y, and in the other part the opposite status relation,
they showed that the languages X and Y can coexist besides each other,
with a narrow interface in between. This reminds us of Canal Street in New
Orleans which in earlier times separated the French quarter from the English
speaking part. We will later return to such geographical coexistence also
without status diﬀerences, arising merely from an initial separation into an
X part and a Y part [14, 18].

8

If we set a = 1 the simple logistic Verhulst equation results [19],

dx/dt = (2s − 1)(1 − x)x

which was applied to languages [20] already before Abrams and Strogatz.
This case was generalized to two Verhulst equations [15] describing the two
populations of people speaking languages X and Y. Now as in Lotka-Volterra
equations for predators eating prey, both populations can coexist with each
other in some parameter range, which in the usual Abrams-Strogatz model
is possible only for x(t = 0) = s = 1/2.

The competition of two languages is changed if some people become bilin-
gual , that means they learn to speak the other language which was not their
mother tongue [12]. This was applied to Gallego versus Castellano in Spain ;
of course, some may regard Castellano spoken in Madrid as the proper Span-
ish, and Gallego as its dialect spoken in Galicia. As citizens of the Prussian
occupied Westbank of the Rhine River, we know that publicly going into such
details before liberation may be dangerous. A language is a dialect with an
army and a navy behind it.

Of course, all these diﬀerential equations are dangerous approximations,
just as mean ﬁeld theory for critical phenomena in statistical physics is dan-
gerous. We know since 80 years that the one-dimensional Ising model has
a positive Curie temperature Tc in the mean-ﬁeld approximation, while in
reality Tc = 0. Thus do the Abrams-Strogatz results remain correct if we
deal with individuals which randomly change from one language to the other,
with probabilities corresponding to the original diﬀerential equation?

In general, the answer is yes [21]: As long as not both s and the initial
concentration x(t = 0) are 1/2, one language still dies out, and it does so
exponentially. This holds for the case of everybody inﬂuencing everybody,
Fig.4, as well as for a square lattice where everybody is inﬂuenced only by
its four lattice neighbours, Fig.5. The line in Fig.4 is the solution of the
diﬀerential equation and agrees qualitatively with the Monte Carlo results
represented by the separate symbols for various total constant populations
N. Only for a completely symmetric start, s = x(t = 0) = 1/2, when
the diﬀerential equation gives an equilibrium (stable for a < 1 and unstable
for a > 1), the microscopic Monte Carlo simulation gives one or the other
language dying out, while the diﬀerential equation then predicts both to
always comprise half of the population each. More details are given in [21].
Finally we mention the model of [3] which also does not deal with indi-

viduals but avoids diﬀerential equations.

9

3 Microscopic models

Here we deal with the more modern methods of language simulations, based
on individuals instead of on overall concentrations. Such methods are applied
in physics since half a century and are called agent-based in some ﬁelds
outside physics. First we review two models for only two (or a few) languages,
then in much greater detail the two models for many languages.

3.1 Few languages

The model of Kosmidis et al [13] for mixing two languages X and Y uses bit-
strings of length 20; each bit can be 0 (representing a word or grammatical as-
pect which is not learned) or 1 (an element which this individual has learned).
If someone speaks language X perfectly and language Y not at all, the bit-
string for this person is 11111111110000000000 while 00000000001111111111
corresponds to a perfect Y-speaker. People can become perfectly bilingual,
having all 20 bits at 1, but this is rare. This model is particularly simple
to explain the generation of a mixture language Z out of the two original
languages X and Y. One merely has to take about ten bits equal to one
and distribute them randomly among the 20 bit positions. This may then
correspond to the creation of Shakespeare’s English out of the Germanic lan-
guage spoken by the Anglo-Saxons and the French spoken by the Normannic
conquerors of the year 1066.

Biological ageing was included in the model of Schwammle [16], using
the well-established Penna model [22, 19, 8] of mutation accumulation. Two
languages X and Y are modelled.
Individuals learn to speak from father
and mother (and thus may become bilingual) and move on a square lattice
in search of emptier regions. Bit-strings are used also here, but only for
the ageing part to store genetic diseases; the two languages have no internal
structure here. A bilingual person surrounded by neighbours speaking mostly
language X forgets with some probability the language Y, and vice versa. The
model allows for the coexistence of the two languages, each in a diﬀerent
region of the lattice, as in [11] but without giving one language a higher
status than the other.

In his later model [16], that author allows for up to 16 languages. Again
the structure of languages is ignored. Only young people can learn languages
from others, and sometimes they learn a new language by themselves. As
a function of the ”mutation” probability to learn independently a new lan-

10

guage, the model gives dominance of one language for small mutation rates,
and fragmentation of the population into many languages for high mutation
rates, with a sharp phase transition separating these two possibilities, e.g. at
a mutation rate near 1/4. This phase transition is similar to that found by
[4] as reviewed above.

3.2 Many languages
To explain the existence of the 104 present human languages, we need diﬀer-
ent models [17, 14] which we review now.

3.2.1 Colonization

After the ﬁrst human beings came to the American continent by crossing the
Bering street several ten thousand years ago, presumably they ﬁrst all spoke
one language. Then they moved southward from Alaska and separated into
diﬀerent tribes which slowly evolved diﬀerent languages. This ﬁrst coloniza-
tion was modeled by Viviane de Oliveira and collaborators [17] by what we
call the Viviane model .

Languages have no internal structure but are labelled by integers 1,2,3 ...
Human population starts at the centre site of a square lattice with language 1,
and from then on humans move to empty neighbour sites of already populated
areas. Each site can carry a population of up to about 102 people, selected
randomly. The size or ﬁtness of a language is the number of people speaking
it. On every new site, the population selects as its own language that of a
populated neighbour site, with a probability proportional to the ﬁtness of
the neighbouring language. In addition, the language can mutate into a new
language with a probability α/size. To prevent this mutation rate to become
too small, this denominator is replaced in their later simulations by some
maximum ≃ 103, if the actual language size is larger than this cut-oﬀ value.
The simulation stops when all lattice sites have been populated. A complete
Fortran program is listed in [14](d).

For a mutation coeﬃcient α = 0.256 the simulated language sizes in the
Viviane model can reach the thousand millions of Chinese [14](d), but the
shape diﬀers from Fig.3 and corresponds more to two power laws than to one
roughly log-normal parabola. In contrast to other models [4, 16, 14] there is
no sharp phase transition between the dominance of one language and the
fragmentation into numerous languages. [14](d).

11

This Brazilian group [23] earlier had claimed that the language size dis-
tribution follows two power laws, both indicating a decay of the number of
languages with increasing language size. This ﬁt, however, applies only to
the large-size tail and not for small sizes where the power law would indicate
an unrealistic divergence. Fig.3 in contrast shows there a very small number,
with less than 102 of the 104 languages spoken by only one person [9]. The
cumulative number of languages spoken by at least s people thus should be
quite ﬂat for small s instead of diverging with a power law for s → 0, as
ﬁtted in [23]. A log-normal distribution gives a much better overall ﬁt and
is for large sizes not necessarily worse than the two power laws of [23].
Further results from the Viviane model are given in our appendix.

3.2.2 Bit-string model

Our own model uses bit-strings as in [13, 16] but for diﬀerent purposes.
Each diﬀerent bit-string represents a diﬀerent language though one may also
deﬁne slightly diﬀerent bit-strings as representing diﬀerent dialects of the
same language. Lengths ℓ of 8 to 64 bits have been simulated, and the
results for 16 bits diﬀered little from those of longer strings, while 8 bits
behaved diﬀerently.

We used three diﬀerent probabilities p, q, r though most properties can
be also obtained form the special cases q = 0, r = 1. When a new individual
is born its language is mutated with probability p compared to that of the
mother. One of the ℓ bits is selected randomly and reverted, which means
a zero bit becomes one and a one bit becomes zero. This p is the mutation
probability per bit-string; the probability per bit is therefore p/ℓ.

When q is not zero, then the above mutation process is modiﬁed. With
probability 1 − q it happens randomly as above, and with probability q the
new value of the bit is obtained not by reverting it but by taking over the
corresponding bit value of a randomly selected individual from the whole
population. This transfer probability q thus describes the eﬀect that one
language can learn concepts from other languages. Many words of higher
civilization in the German language came from French, while French beers
sometimes have German names.

Thus far the simulations are similar to biology with vertical (p) and hori-
zontal (q) gene transfer. Speciﬁc human thinking enters into the third prob-
ability (1 − x2)r (also (1 − x)2 instead of 1 − x2 was used) to give up the
own language and to switch to the language of another randomly selected

12

person. Here x is the fraction of people speaking the old language, and thus
this probability to abandon the old language is particularly high for small
languages. The new language is selected by a random process, but since it
is that of a randomly selected person and not a randomly selected language,
most likely the new language is one of the major languages in the popula-
tion. In this way we simulate the same trend towards dominating language
which was already modelled by Abrams and Strogatz, as described above
in the example of our emigration to Brazil. This ﬂight from small to large
languages, through the parameter r, distinguishes the language competition
from biological competition between species in an ecosystem, and takes into
account human consideration of the utility of the language.

The population size is kept from going to inﬁnity by a Verhulst death
probability proportional to the actual population size. Thus if we start with
one person, the population will grow until it reaches the carrying capacity
given by the reciprocal proportionality factor. More practical is an initial
population which is already about equal to the ﬁnal equilibrium population.
With the latter choice one can start with either everybody talking the same
language, or everybody talking a randomly selected language. A complete
Fortran program for the simple case q = 0, r = 1 is listed in [8].

Compared to the Viviane model explained above, our model is more com-
plicated since it has three probabilities p, q, r instead of only one coeﬃcient
α. However, one can set q = 0, r = 1 in our model and then has the same
number of free parameters. The Viviane model simulates the ﬂight from
small to large languages by a mutation probability inversely proportional to
the size of the languages while we separate the mutations (independent of
language size) from the ﬂight probability (1 − x2)r. Moreover, we simulate a
continuous competition of languages while the Viviane model simulates the
unique historical event of a human population spreading over a continent
where no humans lived before.

The results of our model are reported in [8, 14]. Most important is the
sharp phase transition, for increasing mutation rate p at ﬁxed q and r, be-
tween dominance at small and fragmentation at large p. For dominance, at
least three quarters of the population speak one language, and most of the
others speak a variant diﬀering by only one bit from that language. For
fragmentation, on the other hand, the population spreads over all possible
languages. If we start with dominance, the phase transition to fragmenta-
tion was already described in the biblical story of the Tower of Babel.
If
we start with fragmentation, we get dominance for long enough times and

13

small enough mutation rates, if we use (1 − x)2 instead of 1 − x2 for the ﬂight
probability. Fig.6 shows the phase diagram for ℓ = 8 and 16 if we start from

Tesileanu and Meyer-Ortmanns [18] introduced into this model the Ham-
ming distance as a measure of dissimilarity between languages. This Ham-
ming distance counts the number of diﬀerent bits in a position-by-position
comparison of two bit-strings. Thus the ℓ = 4 strings 0101 and 1010 have a
Hamming distance of four. This distance can be normalized to lie between
zero and one, through division by ℓ. Fig.8 shows this normalized Hamming
distance for both the two largest languages and the average over all possible

pairs. Not much diﬀerence is seen except that the one for the single pair ﬂuc-
tuates much stronger than the average over all pairs. And for dominance the
diﬀerence is very small while for fragmentation is it nearly 1/2. Thus for frag-
mented populations, the various languages are nearly uncorrelated, and half
their bits agree accidentally while the other half disagrees. For dominance,
the minor languages are mostly one-bit mutants of the dominating language.
Fig.8, like Fig.7 before, shows a clear ﬁrst-order phase transition, that means
a sharp jump. Thus far we were not able to modify this model such that
it gives a second-order transition where the fraction of people speaking the
largest language goes continuously to zero at a sharp critical point. Such a
modiﬁcation might give a more realistic distribution of language sizes.

The time dependence of the size of the largest cluster, if we start with
fragmentation, suggests a complicated nucleation process. Originally all lan-

ming distance = fraction of diﬀerent bits. We show both the average distance

guages are about equal in size, and then due to random ﬂuctuations one lan-
guage happens to be somewhat more equal than the others. This language
then wins over, ﬁrst slowly, then rapidly. The time needed for one language
to win increases about logarithmically when the population increases from
103 to 108. Thus for an inﬁnite population, as simulated by deterministic dif-
ferential equations of the Nowak et al style [4], the emergence of dominance
out of a fragmented population might never happen in our model.

First-order phase transitions like those in Figs. 7 and 8 are usually ac-
companied by hysteresis, like when undercooled liquid water is to crystallize
into ice. Thus we should get diﬀerent positions of the eﬀective transition (for

ﬁxed population size and ﬁxed observation time) depending on whether we
start from dominance or fragmentation. This is shown in [14](b), using in
both cases (1 − x)2 for the ﬂight probability.

The language size distribution shows the desired shape of a slightly asym-
metric parabola on the log-log plot (log-normal distribution) but the actual
language sizes are far too small compared with reality. This is not due to
lack of computer power but comes from the sharp ﬁrst-order transition, Figs.7
and 8. Either one language dominates as if 80 percent of the world speaks
Chinese. Or all 2ℓ languages are equivalent apart from ﬂuctuations and thus
each is spoken only by a small population. If the ﬁrst-order transition would
be changed into a second-order one, the results for mutation rates slightly
below the critical point might be better.

An alternative was suggested by linguist Wichmann [24]: The present
language distribution is not in equilibrium. If we assume that parts of the
world are on one side and parts on the other side of the phase transition from
dominance to fragmentation (or from fragmentation to dominance), then the
above equilibrium results are not good. Instead, we show in Fig. 9 two runs
for a non-equilibrium situation of about 5000 iterations at very low mutation

rate, starting from fragmentation. The results are averaged over the second
half of the simulation with the time adjusted such that the phase transition
of ﬁg.11 happened during that second half. Now the language sizes vary
over ﬁve orders of magnitude, much better than before. (If we start from
dominance the size distribution is similar but more symmetric [24].)

4 Conclusion

The last few years have seen the development of a variety of diﬀerent ap-
proaches to simulate the competition between existing languages of adult
humans. Each model has its advantages and disadvantages.

If we follow the tradition of physics, that theories should explain precise
experimental data, then the size histogram of the 104 human languages,
Fig.3, seems to be best candidate. Empirically it is based on Grimes [1]
and was analyzed e.g. by [9, 1, 3, 23]. In order to simulate this language
size distribution, we need models for 104 diﬀerent languages, and only two of
them have been published thus far, the Viviane model and our model [14, 17].
Future work with these models could look at the similarities and diﬀer-
ences between the languages (bit-strings), as started in [18] and Fig.8, or the
geography of languages and their dialects [25], as started in [17].

We thank our coauthors [24, 21] for collaboration.

5 Appendix

This appendix brings some more results for many languages, ﬁrst on the
Viviane model [17] and then on our model [14].

5.1 Viviane colonization model

For the model of [17], one can look at the history how languages split from a
mother languages, and later produced more daughter languages. In contrast
to linguistic ﬁeld research, which looks only at the last few thousand years,
computer simulations can store and analyze the whole history since the be-
[14](d) shows for a small 64 × 64 lattice, how one language split
ginning.
into daughters, etc, very similar to biological speciation trees. For clarity we
omitted numerous languages which had no ”children”. For larger lattices we

18

found that even for many thousand languages a few steps suﬃce on average
to reach from any of the languages in this tree the oldest ancestor language
on the top of the tree. Other tree simulations were published in [26].

Often a conquering population imposes its language to the native popu-
lation. Perhaps in Europe, before the arrival of Indo-European farmers, the
Cro Magnon people spoke a language family of which the Basque language is
the only present survivor. Better documented, though not necessarily more
true, is the story of the single Gallic village in today’s France which resisted
the Roman conquest two millennia ago, thanks to the eﬀorts of Asterix and
Obelix (helped by doping). In the Viviane model, where people may adopt
the language of their neighbours, such a single resistance center can inﬂuence
many other sites during the later spread of languages. indeed a rather large
fraction of the total population is inﬂuenced by Asterix, particularly for large
mutation rates [14](d). In physics, such simulation of the inﬂuence of a single
”error” are called ”damage spreading”.

5.2 Our bit-string model

While the Viviane model always happens on a lattice , for our model the
lattice is optional. If we want to study the geographical coexistence of two
languages in adjacent regions, then of course a lattice is needed [14](b). Now
on every lattice site live many people. Without any diﬀerence in status, as
opposed to [11], on one side one language dominates and on the other side
the other language, if initially each region was occupied only by speakers of
its own language. Also in the transition region the other 2ℓ −2 languages play
no major role. The situation in this ﬁgure may correspond to New Orleans
a long time ago, where Canal Street separated the French quarter from the
newer English settlement. These methods could be applied to dialectometry,
as documented for France by Goebl [25].

Bit-strings allow only Q = 2 choices per position, but the lattice model
was also generalized to Q = 3 and 5 choices. Surprisingly, the phase tran-
sition curve [14](d) between dominance for low and fragmentation for high
mutation rates was independent of this number Q of choices. Only when ℓ
was changed, the diﬀerent transition curves were obtained.

If we want to apply the lattice model to geography we want compact
geographical language regions to emerge from a fragmented start. Then
not only the transfer of language elements but also the ﬂight to another
language needs to be restricted to lattice neighbours, i.e. people learn new

a language learned from a lattice neighbour. We mark the sites where the
largest language is spoken, after 240 and 450 iterations. For t ≥ 514 nearly

elements or a new language only from one of the four nearest neighbours,
randomly selected. Fig.10 shows how one language, accidentally the largest
at intermediate times, grows until is covers nearly the whole lattice.

One may look, without lattice, on the history of people speaking one
randomly selected language in an initially fragmented population. Because
of mutations, after a long enough time everybody has moved at least once
to another language. But since the number L = 2ℓ of possible languages is
ﬁnite, some people move back to their original language, like emigrants whose
oﬀspring later return to their old country. Thus after 50 iterations to give
an equilibrium, we mark all those speaking language zero. Their oﬀspring
carries that mark also, even if they mutate their language, and we count at

Then we see a rapid decrease of that number; to slow down the decay we
modiﬁed the ﬂight probability to 0.1(1 − x2)y2 where y is the fraction for the
language which the individual from fraction x considers to switch to. Then a
slower decay as in Fig.11 results, faster for higher mutation rates. For ℓ = 8
bits we see nicely the random background of less than thousand people (from
50 million) who returned to the language zero of their ancestors; for ℓ = 16
both the initial and the ﬁnal number of zero speakers are much smaller since
the 50 million can now distribute among 65536 instead of only 256 possible
languages.

Human languages can be grouped into families, like the Indo-European
family of 102 diﬀerent languages. To simulate language families we need

a criterion which bit-strings belong into one family. Thus we worked with
ℓ = 64 bits and assumed, following Wichmann, that the leading 19 bits
determine the family and the remaining 45 bits the diﬀerent languages within
one family. The numbers 219 and 245 of possible families and languages are
so large that our computer simulations with less than a million people do not
notice their ﬁnite size. Indeed, the results in Fig.12 for 500, 5000, 50,000 and
500,000 people are roughly independent of population size and show a mostly
monotonically decaying probability distribution function for the number of
languages within one family. Empirical observations were published e.g. by
Wichmann [1].

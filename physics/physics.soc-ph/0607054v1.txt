The Naming Game is a model of non-equilibriun dynamics for the self-organized emergence of
a linguistic convention or a communication system in a population of agents with pairwise local
interactions. We present an extensive study of its dynamics on complex networks, that can be
considered as the most natural topological embedding for agents involved in language games and
opinion dynamics. Except for some community structured networks on which metastable phases
can be observed, agents playing the Naming Game always manage to reach a global consensus. This
convergence is obtained after a time generically scaling with the population’s size N as tconv
∼
N 1.4±0.1, i.e. much faster than for agents embedded on regular lattices. Moreover, the memory
capacity required by the system scales only linearly with its size. Particular attention is given to
heterogenous networks, in which the dynamical activity pattern of a node depends on its degree.
High degree nodes have a fundamental role, but require larger memory capacity. They govern the
dynamics acting as spreaders of (linguistic) conventions. The eﬀects of other properties, such as the
average degree and the clustering, are also discussed.

INTRODUCTION

Understanding the origin and the evolution of language
or more generally of communication systems is a fascinat-
ing challenge for the interdisciplinary scientiﬁc commu-
nity [1], demanding contributions to researchers in very
diﬀerent ﬁelds, from linguistics to artiﬁcial intelligence,
from social sciences to biology, mathematics and physics.
Even though a unitarian view of language as a complex
system is still lacking, a number of diﬀerent approaches
have been proposed in order to get major insights into
some speciﬁc aspects such as,
for instance, the self-
organized processes leading to the emergence of a shared
lexicon (i.e. a communication system) in a population
of agents. In the past few years, it has been shown that
simple models of interacting agents could display a collec-
tive agreement on a shared mapping between words and
objects (or meanings), eventually bootstrapping a shared
system of linguistic conventions, even without global su-
pervision or a priori common knowledge [2, 3, 4]. Such
models of “Language Games”, in which the organization
of language is tackled at a purely semiotic level (neglect-
ing semantic relations between symbols and meanings),
have played a pivotal role for the understanding of emer-
gent communication systems. We will restrain ourselves
to the case of the emergence and evolution of a commu-
nication system on short temporal scales compared to
those involved in the evolution of language, so that we
neglect any darwinian principle commonly used in the
modelization of language evolution [5, 6], and focus on
simple population dynamics. In this context, a new ﬁeld
of research called Semiotic Dynamics has been recently
developed, that investigates by means of simple models
how (linguistic) conventions originate, spread and evolve
over time in a population of agents endowed with basic
internal states and able to perform local pairwise inter-
actions [7].

The fundamental model of Semiotic Dynamics is the

Naming Game [8], that describes a population of agents
trying to agree on the assignation of names to objects.
The emergence of consensus about the object’s name al-
lows to establish a communication system. Such model
was inspired by global coordination problems in Artiﬁcial
Intelligence and by peer-to-peer communication model-
ing. A practical example of this type of dynamics is
provided by the Talking Heads experiment [9], in which
embodied software agents develop their vocabulary ob-
serving objects through digital cameras, assigning them
randomly chosen names and sharing these names in pair-
wise interactions. Very recently [10, 11], models of Semi-
otic Dynamics have as well found application in the
study of a new generation of web-tools which enable hu-
man web-users to self-organize a system of tags in such
a way to ensure a shared classiﬁcation of information
about diﬀerent arguments (see, for instance, del.icio.us
or www.ﬂickr.com).

surprise that, recently, various contributions have come
from physicists, in order to shed light on the dynam-
ics of opinion formation through the study of models of
social interactions [12]. The Naming Game (NG), as a
model of interacting agents reaching a global consensus
through emergent cooperative phenomena, can as well be
studied through the statistical physics toolbox that can
give insights into the corresponding complex dynamics.
As a ﬁrst natural step, previous studies have considered,
as was the case in the Talking Heads experiments, that
each agent was allowed to interact with all the others [13].
This mean-ﬁeld like scenario can indeed be realistic when
dealing with a small number of agents. Moreover, the
case of agents embedded into low-dimensional lattices has
as well been investigated [14], showing that the global
behavior of the Naming Game strongly depends on the
underlying topology. Recently however, the growing ﬁeld

of complex networks [15, 16, 17] has allowed to obtain a
better knowledge of social networks [18], and in partic-
ular to show that the typical topology of the networks
on which agents interact is not regular. The natural step
taken in this paper is thus to consider the Naming Game
for agents embedded on more realistic networks and to
study the inﬂuence of various complex topologies on the
corresponding dynamical behavior.

The paper is organized as follows. Section II and III
are devoted to the deﬁnition of the model and to sum-
marize already known results about the Naming Game
dynamics in the case of mean-ﬁeld and low dimensional
lattices.
In section IV, we brieﬂy recall the deﬁnition
of network models subsequently used in the theoretical
and numerical analysis, whose results are exposed in sec-
tion V. Conclusions and directions for future works are
exposed in section VI.

II. MODEL DEFINITION

A minimal model of Naming Game has been put for-
ward by Baronchelli et al. in Ref. [13] to reproduce the
main features of Semiotic Dynamics and the fundamental
results of adaptive coordination observed in the Talking
Heads experiment [9]. In this minimal model, N iden-
tical agents observe a single object, for which they in-
vent names that they try to communicate to one another
through pairwise interactions. Each agent is endowed
with an internal inventory, in which it can store an a pri-
ori unlimited number of names (or opinions). All agents
start with empty inventories. At each time step, a pair
of neighboring agents is chosen randomly, one playing as
”speaker” the other as ”hearer”, and a negotiation pro-
cess takes place according to the following rules (see also
Figure 1). The speaker transmits a name to the hearer.
If its inventory is empty, a new word is invented, other-
wise it selects randomly one of the names it knows. If the
hearer has the uttered name in its inventory, the game
is a success, and both agents delete all their words but
the winning one. If the hearer does not know the uttered
word, the game is a failure, and the hearer adds the word
to its inventory, i.e. it learns it.

Note that the time unit is here given by one inter-
action, in contrast to most non-equilibrium statistical
physics models in which a time unit corresponds to N
interactions.
In many cases, results for the dynamical
evolution will therefore be expressed as a function of the
rescaled time t/N .

Although this model can be seen as belonging to the
broad class of opinion formation models, it is interesting
to notice the important diﬀerences with other commonly
studied such models [12]. In particular, each agent can
potentially be in an inﬁnite number of possible discrete
states (or words, names), contrarily to the Voter model in
which each agent has only two possible states. Moreover,
an agent can here accumulate in its memory diﬀerent
possible names for the object, i.e. wait before reaching a

FIG. 1: (Color online) Agents’ interaction rules. Each agent is
described by its inventory, i.e. the repertoire of known words.
The speaker picks up at random a name in its inventory and
transmits it to the hearer. If the hearer does not know the
selected word the interaction is a failure (top), and it adds the
new name to its inventory. Otherwise (bottom) the interac-
tion is a success and both agents delete all their words but the
winning one. Note that if the speaker has an empty inventory
(as it happens at the beginning of the game), it invents a new
name and the interaction is, of course, a failure.

decision, and has an a priori unlimited memory. An in-
teresting question therefore relates to the actual memory
size required by each agent during the dynamics. Finally,
each dynamical step can be seen as a negotiation between
speaker and hearer, with a certain degree of stochastic-
ity, while in the Voter model, an agent deterministically
adopts the opinion of one of its neighbors.

Another remark concerns the random extraction of the
word to be uttered from the speaker’s inventory. Previ-
ously proposed models of semiotic dynamics used a more
complicated representation of the negotiation interaction
assigning weights to the words in the inventories. In such
models (see [19] and references therein), the word with
largest weight is automatically chosen by the speaker and
communicated to the hearer. Communicative success or
failures are translated into updates of the weights: the
weight of a word involved in a successful interaction is
increased to the detriment of the other weights (with no
deletion process), while a failure leads to the decrease
of the weight of the word not understood by the hearer.
While such rules are certainly more realistic than the
drastic deletion rule of the minimal Naming Game, the
latter has been shown to retain the essential features of
the emergence of a global collective behavior and corre-
sponds to a much simpler deﬁnition.

It is also worth noting that in the minimal Naming
Game all agents refer to the same single object, while
in the original experiments the embodied agents could
observe a set of diﬀerent objects. This is due to the as-
sumption that homonymy is excluded, i.e. it is impossible
that two distinct objects assume the same name. Thus,

in the model, all objects are independent and the general
problem reduces to a set of uncorrelated systems, each
one described by the minimal model.

In the rest of the paper all analysis and numerical sim-
ulations will deal with this simpliﬁed model that can be
rightly seen as the prototype of the Naming Game.

III. STATE OF THE ART

Most previous studies in Semiotic Dynamics have fo-
cused on populations of agents in which all pairwise inter-
actions are allowed, i.e. the agents are placed on the ver-
tices of a fully-connected graph. In statistical mechanics,
this topological structure is commonly referred as ”mean-
ﬁeld” topology.
In the original work on the minimal
Naming Game model [13], Baronchelli et al. have studied
numerically and analytically the behavior of the mean-
ﬁeld model, providing theoretical arguments in order to
explain the main properties of the population’s global
behavior. The overall dynamics have been studied moni-
toring the temporal evolution of the total number Nw(t)
of words in the system at time t, i.e. the total memory
used by the agents’ inventories, of the number of diﬀer-
ent words Nd(t), and of the average success rate S(t) (i.e.
the probability, computed averaging on many simulation
runs, that the interaction at time t is successful). At the
beginning, many disjoint pairs of agents interact, with
empty initial inventories: they invent a large number of
diﬀerent words that then start spreading throughout the
system, through unsuccessful interactions. Indeed, in the
early stages of the dynamics, the overlap between inven-
tories is very low and successful interactions are limited
to those pairs which have been chosen at least twice.
Since the number of possible partners of an agent is of
order N , an agent rarely interacts twice with the same
partner: the probability of such an event grows only as
t/N 2. The consequence, shown in Fig. 2 (black circles),
is that in this phase the number of diﬀerent words Nd
invented by the agents grows, reaching a maximum that
scales as
(N ). Nd then saturates (no inventory is empty
anymore so that no new words are invented) and displays
a plateau, while the total number Nw of words keep grow-
ing since the various words propagate in the system and
correlations grow between inventories. The peak of Nw

strong correlations built during this time ﬁnally lead the
system to consensus in a time tconv of order N 1.5. The
ﬁnal state corresponds to the agreement of the agents on
the name to be assigned to a particular object: Nw = N ,
which means that each agent possesses a unique word in
its inventory, and Nd = 1, which shows that this word
is the same for all agents. The S-shaped curve (black
circles) of the success rate in Fig. 2 summarizes the dy-
namics:

icant overlaps, so that S(t) increases until it reaches 1,
and the communication system is completely set in.

A ﬁrst study of the eﬀects of topological embedding
on the Naming Game dynamics is reported in Ref. [14].
When the interacting agents sit on the nodes of low-
dimensional lattices, the long-time behavior is still char-
acterized by the convergence to a homogeneous consensus
state, but the evolution of the system changes consid-
erably. Since each agent can interact only with a lim-
ited number of neighbors (2d in a d-dimensional lattice),
at the local scale the dynamics is very fast: agents can
rapidly interact two or more times with their neighbors,
favoring the establishment of a local consensus with a
high success rate (Fig. 2, red squares for 1D and blue
triangles for 2D), i.e. of small sets of neighboring agents
sharing a common unique word. These ”clusters” of
neighboring agents with a common unique word are sep-
arated by individuals having a larger inventory with two
or more words, playing the role of ”interfaces”. For one-
dimensional systems, it can be proved analytically [14]
that the motion of interfaces is a random walk for which
the diﬀusion coeﬃcient can be computed. Consequently,
the clusters of unique words grow in time with a law that
is typical of coarsening phenomena [20], i.e. the compe-
tition among the clusters is driven by the ﬂuctuations of
the interfaces. The coarsening picture can be extended
to higher dimensions, where it has been checked numer-
ically. Such an analysis shows that in low-dimensional
structures local consensus is easy but in the long run de-
lays the global consensus, which takes much longer to
be reached than in mean-ﬁeld (see Fig. 2): for example,

ever, another important aspect of the problem concerns
the memory used by the agents. In mean-ﬁeld indeed,
(N 1/2),
each agent needs a memory capacity scaling as
i.e. diverging with the system size. In contrast, the con-
sequence of the embedding in a ﬁnite-dimensional lattice
(with ﬁnite number of neighbors), and of the subsequent
coarsening like phenomena, with rapid local consensus,
is that each agent uses only a ﬁnite capacity: the max-
imum total number of words in the system (maximal
memory capacity) scales linearly with the system size N
(as for the number of diﬀerent words). In summary, low-
dimensional lattice systems require more time to reach
the consensus compared to mean-ﬁeld, but a lower use of
memory.

Social interactions however take place on networks that
are neither mean-ﬁeld like nor regular lattices, but share
a certain number of properties such as the small-world
property (the average topological distance between nodes
increases very slowly -logarithmically or even slower- with
the number of nodes) and the relative abundance of
“hubs” (nodes with very large degree compared to the
mean of the degree distribution P (k)). More precisely,
the degree distributions are in many cases heterogeneous,
with heavy-tails often of a power-law (or “scale-free”)
nature (for a signiﬁcant range of values of k, one has
k−γ) [15, 16, 17]. Moreover, social networks
P (k)
are often characterized by a large transitivity, which im-
plies that two neighbors of a given vertex are also con-
nected to each other with large probability. Transitivity
can be quantitatively measured by means of the clus-
tering coeﬃcient ci of vertex i [21], deﬁned as the ratio
between the number of edges mi existing between the
ki neighbors of i, and its maximum possible value, i.e.
1)). The average clustering coeﬃcient,
ci = 2mi/(ki(ki −
deﬁned as C =
i ci/N , usually takes quite large values
in real complex networks.

In order to investigate to what extent these properties
can aﬀect the local and global dynamics of the Nam-
ing Game, we have performed extensive simulations of
this model with agents embedded on the nodes of var-
ious paradigmatic computer-generated network models,
whose deﬁnitions and main properties are recalled in the
next section.

IV. NETWORKS DEFINITION

While many models with various characteristics have
been proposed in the last years in order to account for
various detailed properties of real-world networks, our
aim in this paper is to understand the inﬂuence on the
dynamics of the Naming Game of the most salient prop-
erties such as heterogeneity in the degree distribution,
clustering, average degree, and we will therefore concen-
trate on a few network models that have become indeed
paradigms of complex networks.

The prototype of homogeneous networks is the un-
correlated random graph model proposed by Erd¨os and

4

k
h

i ≃

R´enyi (ER model) [23], whose construction consists in
drawing an (undirected) edge with a ﬁxed probability p
between each possible pair out of N given vertices. The
resulting graph shows a binomial degree distribution with
average
N p, converging to a poissonian distribu-
tion for large N . If p is suﬃciently small (order 1/N ), the
graph is sparse and presents locally tree-like structures.
In order to account for degree heterogeneity, other con-
structions have been proposed for random graphs with
arbitrary degree distributions [24, 25, 26, 27].
In par-
ticular, we will consider the uncorrelated conﬁguration
(UC) model which yields uncorrelated random graphs
through the following construction: N vertices with a
ﬁxed degree sequence taken from the desired degree dis-
tribution, with a cut-oﬀ √N , are connected randomly
avoiding multi-links and self-links.

∼

Since many real networks are not static but evolv-
ing, with new nodes entering and establishing connec-
tions to already existing nodes, many models of growing
networks have also been introduced. We will consider
the model introduced by Barab´asi and Albert (BA) [28],
which has become one of the most famous models for
complex heterogeneous networks, and is constructed as
follows: starting from a small set of m interconnected
nodes, new nodes are introduced one by one. Each new
node selects m older nodes according to the preferen-
tial attachment rule, i.e. with probability proportional to
their degree, and creates links with them. The procedure
stops when the required network size N is reached. The
obtained network has average degree
= 2m, small
clustering (of order 1/N ) and a power-law degree distri-
bution P (k)

k−γ, with γ = 3.

k
h

i

The BA networks have small clustering, in contrast
with social networks.
It turns out that growing net-
works can as well be constructed with a large cluster-
ing.
In Ref. [29] indeed, Dorogovtsev et al. have pro-
posed a model (DMS model) in which each new node
connects with the two extremities of a randomly cho-
sen edge, forming therefore a triangle. Since the num-
ber of edges arriving to any node is in fact its de-
gree, the probability of attaching the new node to an
old node is proportional to its degree and the prefer-
ential attachment is recovered. The degree distribution
is therefore the same as the one of a BA model with
m = 2, and the degree-degree correlations are as well
equal. However, the clustering coeﬃcient is large and
approximately equal to 0.73 [30]. In order to tune the
clustering, we can consider a generalization of this con-
struction,
in the spirit of the Holme-Kim model [31]:
starting from m connected nodes (with m even), a new
node is added at each time step; with probability q it
is connected to m nodes chosen with the preferential at-
tachment rule (BA step), and with probability 1
q it is
connected to the extremities of m/2 edges chosen at ran-
dom (DMS-like step). The one-node and two-node prop-
erties (i.e. degree distribution and degree-degree corre-
lations) are the same as the ones of the BA network,
while the clustering spectrum, i.e. the average cluster-

−

ing coeﬃcient of nodes of degree k, can be computed as
C(k) = 2(1

changing m and q allow to tune the value of the cluster-
ing coeﬃcient.

Since the ER model also displays a low clustering, we
consider moreover a purposedly modiﬁed version of this
random graph model (Clustered ER, or CER model)
with tunable clustering. Given N nodes, each pair of
nodes is considered with probability p; the two nodes are
then linked with probability 1

ity Q, a third node (which is not already linked with
either) is chosen and a triangle is formed. The clus-
tering is thus proportional to Q (with p

work) while the average degree is approximately given

The next section contains the results of simulations
of the minimal Naming Game with agents embedded on
ER and BA networks. Our simulations have been car-
ried out on networks of sizes ranging from 103 to 5.104
nodes, with results averaged over 20 runs per network
realization and over 20 network realizations. Since the
BA model has some particular hierarchical structure due
to its growing construction, we have compared the corre-
sponding results with the case of networks created with
the UC model, in which the exponent of the degree dis-
tribution can moreover be varied. It turns out that the
obtained behavior is very similar, so that we will display
results for the BA model. The eﬀect of clustering will be
discussed using the mixed BA-DMS and the CER net-
work models.

V. RESULTS

In this section we expose the main results on the dy-
namics of the Naming Game on complex networks. Be-
fore entering into the details of the analysis, it is worth
noting that the minimal Naming Game model itself, as
described in section II, is not well-deﬁned on general net-
works. Indeed, the two neighboring agents chosen to in-
teract have diﬀerent roles: one (the speaker) transmits
a word and is thus more ”active” than the other (the
hearer). One should therefore specify whether, when
choosing a pair, one chooses ﬁrst a speaker and then a
hearer among the speaker’s neighbors, or the reverse or-
der. If the agents sit on either a fully connected graph
or on a regular lattice, they have an equivalent neigh-
borhood so the order is not important. On a generic
network with degree distribution P (k) however, the de-
gree of the ﬁrst chosen node and of its chosen neigh-
bor are distributed respectively according to P (k) and to
kP (k)/
. The second node will therefore have typically
i
a larger degree, and the asymmetry between speaker and
hearer can couple to the asymmetry between a randomly
chosen node and its randomly chosen neighbor, leading
to diﬀerent dynamical properties (this is the case for ex-
ample in the Voter model, as studied by Castellano [33]).

This is particularly relevant in heterogeneous networks
for which a neighbor of a randomly chosen node is a hub
with relatively large probability. We therefore can distin-
guish more possibilities for the deﬁnition of the Naming
Game on generic networks.

(i) A randomly chosen speaker selects (again ran-
domly) a hearer among its neighbors. This is prob-
ably the most natural generalization of the original
rule. We call this strategy direct Naming Game. In
this case, larger degree nodes will preferentially act
as hearers.

ing Game, can also be carried out: we choose

is that of considering the extremities of an edge
taken uniformly at random. The role of speaker
and hearer are then assigned randomly with equal
probability among the two nodes.

Figure 3 allows to compare the evolution of the di-
rect and the reverse Naming Game for a BA network of
N = 104 agents and
= 4. In the case of the reverse
rule, a larger memory is used although the number of dif-
ferent words created is smaller, and a faster convergence
is obtained. This corresponds to the fact that the hubs,
playing principally as speakers, can spread their words to
a larger fraction of the agents, and remain more stable
than when playing as hearers, enhancing the possibility

of convergence. Depending on the network under study,
and similarly to the Voter model case [33], the scaling
laws of the convergence time can even be modiﬁed, as our
preliminary study shows. A detailed analysis of this be-
havior remains however beyond the scope of our present
study and we leave it for future work (see also [34]). From
the point of view of a realistic interaction among individ-
uals or computer-based agents, the direct Naming Game
in which the speaker chooses a hearer among its neigh-
bors seems somehow more natural than the other ones.
In the remainder of this paper therefore, we will focus on
the direct Naming Game, mentioning where necessary
the corresponding behavior for the other two rules.

A. Global quantities

We ﬁrst study the global behavior of the system
through the temporal evolution of three main quantities:
the total number Nw(t) of words in the system, the num-
ber of diﬀerent words Nd(t), and the rate of success S(t).
All these quantities are averaged over a large number of
runs and networks realizations. In Fig. 4, we report the
curves of Nw(t) and Nd(t) for ER (left) and BA networks
(right) with N = 103, 104 and 5.104 nodes and average
= 4. The corresponding data for the mean-
degree
ﬁeld case (with N = 103) are displayed as well for refer-
ence. The curves for the average use of memory Nw(t)
show a rapid growth at short times, a peak and then a

increased (even when time is rescaled by the system size,
as in Fig. 4). The time and height of the peak, and the
height of the plateau, are proportional to N . These scal-
ing properties are systematically studied in Fig. 5, which
also shows that the convergence time tconv scales as N 1.4
for both ER and BA. The apparent plateau of Nw does
however not correspond to a steady state, as revealed by
the continuous decrease of the number of diﬀerent words
Nd in the system: in this re-organization phase, the sys-
tem keeps evolving by elimination of words, although the
total used memory almost does not change.

The scaling laws observed for the convergence time is
a general robust feature that is not aﬀected by further
topological details, such as the average degree, the clus-
tering or the particular form of the degree distribution.

memory, and almost no cancellation of words, is replaced
here by a slow continuous decrease of Nd with an almost
constant memory used. With respect to the slow coars-
ening process observed in ﬁnite dimensional lattices on
the other hand, the small-world properties of the net-
works, i.e. the existence of short paths among the nodes,
speeds up the convergence towards the global consensus
(see also [35]). Therefore, complex networks exhibiting
small-world properties constitute an interesting trade-oﬀ
between mean-ﬁeld ”temporal eﬃciency” and regular lat-
tice ”storage optimization”.

B. Clusters statistics

We now turn our attention to a complementary aspect
of the dynamics of the Naming Game: the behavior of
clusters of words. We call ”cluster” any set of neighbor-
ing agents sharing a common unique word. In the case of
agents embedded in low-dimensional lattices, it has in-
deed been shown [14] that the dynamics of the Naming
Game proceeds by formation of such clusters, that grow
through a coarsening phenomenon: the average cluster
size (resp. the number of clusters) increases (resp. de-
creases) algebraically with time. On generic networks, a
diﬀerent behavior can be expected. As shown indeed in
Fig. 7 for the ER model (the behaviour is very similar
for the BA model) the number of clusters reaches very
rapidly a plateau that lasts up to the convergence time
at which it suddenly falls to 1. Moreover, the normalized
average cluster size remains very close to zero (in fact,
of order 1/N ) during the plateau, and converges to one
with a similar sudden transition. This transition becomes
steeper when the average degree increases (and also when
the size of the system increases), as also emphasized by
sharper peaks in the variance of the cluster size.

In the same spirit, it is interesting to monitor the num-
ber of agents with a certain number of words: agents
with only one word are parts of clusters while agents us-
ing more memory are propagating words from one part
of the system to another. Fig. 8 shows the temporal evo-
lution of the fractions of nodes with 1, 2 and 3 words.
As for Nw and the cluster size, these quantities dis-
play plateaus whose length increases with the system size
(even in rescaled time units t/N ), and converge respec-
tively to 1 and 0 abruptly at tconv. Moreover, n1 is much

Fig. 9 shows that, on uncorrelated scale-free networks
(UC model), the data (circles) obtained by numerical
simulations are in qualitative agreement with the direct
calculations of the expression in Eq. 2 (crosses). These
data together with Eq. 2 show that, at the very begin-
ning, the success rate grows linearly but the eﬀect of the
degree heterogeneity is partially screened by the presence
of the constant term
. The same argument can be
i
used to predict that the success rate should be essentially
degree independent for larger times. S(t) is indeed always
given by two terms, of which only that referring to the
node playing as speaker contains an explicit dependence
on 1/k. The argument is only approximate since the mul-
tiplicative prefactors contain non-negligible correlations
due to the overlapping inventories. More precisely, these
arguments are correct for a neutral Naming Game rule,
but they should hold also for the direct Naming Game
in which the constant term, coming from the activity of
nodes as hearers, is much more relevant for high degree
nodes.

Another interesting point concerns the height of the
memory peak. Looking at classes of nodes of given de-

These fractions evolve only very slowly during the plateau

and N = 5.104 (full line).

lower than what would be observed in a coarsening pro-
cess in which agents with more than one word are only
found at the interfaces.

The emerging picture is very diﬀerent from the coars-
ening obtained on ﬁnite dimensional lattices, although
the initial formation of small clusters of agents reaching
a local consensus through repeated interactions is similar.
While a majority of nodes soon compose small clusters,
the fraction of nodes with more words is not negligible
and decreases only at the end of the evolution. There-
fore, the dynamics can not be seen as a coarsening or
growth of clusters but as a slow process of correlations
between inventories, in a way much more similar to what
is observed in mean-ﬁeld [13].

C. Eﬀect of the degree heterogeneity

In regular topologies, as well as in mean-ﬁeld, all agents
face an identical environment. Complex networks are dif-
ferent in that respect, and strong diﬀerences in behavior
can be expected for agents sitting on nodes with large
or small degrees. Global properties of dynamical pro-
cesses are often aﬀected by the heterogeneous character
of the network topology [16, 17]. The previous subsec-
tion however has shown that, similarly to what happens
for the Voter model [36], the dynamics of the Naming
Game is similar on heterogeneous and homogeneous net-
works. Nonetheless, a more detailed analysis reveals that
agents with diﬀerent degrees present very diﬀerent activ-
ity patterns, whose characterization is necessary to get
additional insights on the Naming Game dynamics [38].
Let us ﬁrst consider the average success rate Sk(t) of

gree, we get that the height of the memory peak is larger
for nodes of larger degree, as shown in Fig 10. This can
be understood by the fact that hubs act more frequently
as hearers and therefore receive and collect the diﬀerent
words created in the various ”areas” of the network they
connect together [45]. In fact, the maximal memory used
by a node of degree k is proportional to √k (see bottom
panel in Fig. 10). For the mean-ﬁeld case, all agents
have degree k = N
1 and the maximal value of the
total memory Nw scales indeed as N √k = N 3/2. Note
however that in the general case, the estimation of the
peak of Nw is not as straightforward. This peak is indeed
a convolution of the peaks of the inventory sizes of sin-
gle agents, that have distinct activity patterns and may
reach their maximum in memory at diﬀerent temporal
steps.

−

The knowledge of the average maximal memory of a
node of degree k is not suﬃcient to understand which
degree classes play a major role in driving the dynamics
towards the consensus. More insights on this issue can
be obtained observing the behavior of the total number
of diﬀerent words in each degree class. Figure 11 shows
the evolution of the number Nd(k, t) of diﬀerent words
in the class of nodes with degree k, for various values of
k in a BA network with size N = 104 and
= 4. Two
competing eﬀects take part in determining the diﬀerences
between nodes: high degree nodes require more mem-
ory than low degree nodes (Fig. 10), but their number
is much smaller. As a result, low degree classes have in
fact overall a larger number of diﬀerent words (as shown
in Fig. 11). This is due to the fact that during the initial

top of each other).

phase, in which words are invented, low degree nodes are
more often chosen as speakers and invent many diﬀerent
words. The hubs need each a larger memory but they
in fact retain a smaller number of diﬀerent words. After
the peak in memory, the dynamical evolution displays
a relatively fast decrease of Nd(k, t) for small k while a
plateau is observed at large k: words are progressively
eliminated for low-k nodes while the hubs, which act as
intermediaries and are in contact with many agents, still
have typically many words in their inventories. The role
of the hubs, then, is that of diﬀusing words through-
out the network and their property of connecting nodes
with originally diﬀerent words helps the system to con-
verge. On the other hand, however, playing mostly as
hearers, the hubs are not able to promote actively suc-
cessful words, and their convergence follows that of the
neighboring low-degree sites. In fact, once the low-degree
nodes have successfully eliminated most of the diﬀerent
words created initially, the system globally converges on
a faster timescale. We note that the average memory
Nw(k, t)/Nk converges slightly faster than Nd(k, t) (and
that Nd(k, t) converges faster for larger k), showing that
the very ﬁnal phase consists in the late adoption of the
consensus by the lowest degree nodes, in a sort of ﬁnal
cascade from the large to the small degrees.

D. Eﬀect of the average degree and clustering

Social networks are generally sparse graphs, but their
structure is often characterized by high local cohesive-
ness, that is the result of a very natural transitive prop-
erty of many social interactions [18]. The simplest way
to take into account these features on the dynamics of
Naming Game is that of studying the eﬀects of changing
the average degree and the clustering coeﬃcient of the
network.

The eﬀects of increasing the average degree on the
behavior of the main global quantities are reported in
Fig.12.
In both ER (left) and BA (right) models, in-
creasing the average degree provokes an increase in the
memory used, while the global convergence time is de-
creased. Note also that, while the behavior of the conver-
gence time with N (i.e. a power-law N β with β
1.4)
is very robust, the linear scaling for the memory peak
N α with α = 1),
N α and tmax ∝
properties (N max
are slightly altered by an increase in the average degree
(not shown). Increasing
at ﬁnite N brings indeed the
system closer to the mean-ﬁeld behavior where the scal-
ing of these quantities is non-linear (αMF = 1.5); at large
enough sizes however, the linear scaling is recovered.

Moreover, for larger average degree, the number of

larger possibilities of interaction given by the larger num-
ber of connections allows for a better sharing of common
words and for a more eﬃcient correlation of inventories,
thus favoring a faster convergence.

Note that the clustering is slightly changing when
changing the average degree, but its variation is small
enough for the two eﬀects to be studied separately. Here
we use some other mechanisms to enhance clustering,
summarized in the following two models that have been
deﬁned in section IV: clustered Erd¨os-R´enyi (CER) ran-
dom graphs, and mixed BA-DMS model.

Figure 13 shows the eﬀect of increasing the cluster-
ing at ﬁxed average degree and degree distributions: the
number of diﬀerent words is not changed, but the average
memory used is smaller and the convergence takes more
time. Moreover, the memory peak at ﬁxed k is smaller

network. The case of the BA model with m = 4 is shown with
a dashed line for reference.

for larger clustering (not shown):
it is more probable
for a node to speak to 2 neighbors that share common
words because they are themselves connected and have
already interacted, so that it is less probable to learn
new words. Favored by the larger number of triangles,
cliques of neighboring nodes learn from the start the same
word, causing a slight increase in the fraction of nodes
with only one word as reported in Fig. 14 for both ho-
mogeneous and heterogeneous networks. At ﬁxed aver-
age degree i.e. global number of links, less connections
are moreover available to transmit words from one part
of the network to the other since many links are used in
“local” triangles. The enhanced local coherence therefore
is in the long run an obstacle to the global convergence.
We note that this eﬀect is similar to the observation by
, more clustered net-
Holme et al. [37] that, at ﬁxed
i
works are more vulnerable to attacks since many links
are “wasted” in redundant local connections.

E. Eﬀect of hierarchical structures

In the previous sections we have argued that networks
with small-world property have fast (mean-ﬁeld like) con-
vergence after a re-organization phase whose duration
depends on other properties of the system. The small-
world property holds when the diameter of the network
grows slowly, i.e. logarithmically or slower, with its size
N . This ensures that every part of the network is rapidly
reachable from any other part, in contrast to what hap-
pens with regular lattices. Such property therefore gener-
ically enhances the possibility of creating correlations be-
tween the inventories of the agents and of ﬁnally converg-
ing to a consensus. In this subsection, we show that this
line of reasoning bears, surprisingly at ﬁrst sight, some
exceptions.

The ﬁrst (and easiest to apprehend) exception is given

11

−

by the scale-free trees, obtained by the preferential at-
tachment procedure with m = 1. In this case, as shown
in Fig. 15, the convergence is reached very slowly, with
Nw(t)/N
1 decreasing as a power law of the time. This
is in contrast with the generic behavior, i.e. a plateau fol-
lowed by an exponential convergence, as shown also for
reference in Fig. 15, but similar to the ﬁnite-dimensional
lattices (the average cluster size as well grows as a power-
law, in contrast with the data of Fig. 7). This is reminis-
cent of what happens for the Voter model [36], in which
a power-law instead of exponential decrease of the frac-
tion of active bonds is observed, and can be understood
through the tree structure of the network. Indeed, from
the viewpoint of the dynamics, a tree is formed by two
ingredients: linear structures on which the interfaces be-
tween clusters diﬀuse as in one-dimensional systems and
branching points at which interfaces may be pinned and
their motion slowed. In fact, we have checked that simi-
lar (slow) power-law behaviors are also obtained for the
in which every node
Naming Game on Cayley tree (i.e.
has the same degree) or for scale-free tree with diﬀerent
degree distributions (obtained through the generalized
linear preferential attachment model).

The slowness of this dynamical behavior is however
rooted in a slightly more subtle consideration. As Fig. 15
indeed shows, the Naming Game displays power-law con-
vergence in other heterogeneous networks that are not at
all tree-like, such as the DMS model with m = 2 [29],
in which at each step a triangle is created, the determin-
istic scale-free networks of Barab´asi, Ravasz and Vicsek
(BRV) [39] or the Apollonian and Random Apollonian
Networks (RAN) [40, 41]. Let us brieﬂy recall how these
networks are constructed:

•

•

•

For the DMS model with m = 2, one adds at each
step a new node which is connected to the extrem-
ities of a randomly chosen edge.

For the deterministic scale-free BRV networks, one
starts (step 1) with two nodes connected to a root.
At each step n, two units (of 3n−1nodes) identi-
cal to the network formed at the previous step are
added, and each of the bottom 2n nodes are con-
nected to the root.

The Random Apollonian networks are embedded in
a two-dimensional plane. One starts with a trian-
gle; a node is added in the middle of the triangle
and connected to the three previous nodes; at each
step, a new node is added in one of the existing
triangles (chosen at random) and connected to its
three corners, replacing the chosen triangle by three
new smaller triangles.

All these networks share a very important and hard to
quantify property: they are hierarchically built. This is
particularly clear for the BRV case, since at each step the
new network is formed by three identical sub-networks.
In the RAN as well, hierarchically nested units can be
identiﬁed with the triangles, each of which contains other

smaller triangles. Finally, in the DMS case, one can iden-
tify a unit at a certain scale as an edge and the set of
nodes that have been attached to the extremities of this
edge or of the edges subsequently created in this unit.
Because of these particular network organizations, each
node belongs in fact to a given sub-hierarchical unit and,
to go from one node to another node in another sub-
unit, a hierarchical path has to be followed. The trees
represent a particular class of such structures, in which
there exist only one path between two given nodes. In
this sense, such networks, although being small-world,
present a structure which renders communication be-
tween diﬀerent parts of the network more diﬃcult. Each
sub-unit can therefore converge towards a local consensus
which renders the global consensus more cumbersome to
achieve.

Such results show that the small-world property in fact
does not by itself guarantee an eﬃcient convergence of
dynamical processes such as the Naming Game, and that
strongly hierarchical structures in fact slow down and
obstruct such convergence.

VI. DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK

In this article, we have studied the dynamical proper-
ties of the minimal Naming Game model [13] in popula-
tions of agents interacting on complex topologies, focus-
ing on homogeneous and heterogeneous networks (rep-
resented respectively by the Erd¨os-R´enyi random graph
model and by the Barab´asi-Albert scale-free model). So-
cial networks indeed are typically neither fully connected
graphs nor regular lattices. We have considered the ef-
fects of various networks characteristics such as the het-
erogeneity, the average degree and the presence of clus-
tering.

The main characteristic of the studied networks is the
small-world property (the average hopping distance be-
tween two nodes scales only logarithmically with the
size of the network). After an initial phase during
which words are created, the small-world property en-
sures their propagation out of the local scale, boosting
up the spreading process contrarily to what happens in
low dimensional lattices where words’ spreading is purely
diﬀusive (see sections V A-V B). As already suggested
in Ref. [35], we argue that the small-world property al-
lows to inhomogeneous and sparse networks to recover
the high temporal eﬃciency observed in the mean-ﬁeld
system. For both the ER and BA network models we
get a scaling law for the convergence time tconv with the
N βSW , with ex-
size N of the system of the type tconv ∼
1.4. The discrepancy with
ponent approximately βSW ≃
1.5) may be due to loga-
the mean-ﬁeld exponent (βMF ≃
rithmic corrections that are unlikely to be captured using
numerical scaling techniques. Moreover, small-world net-
works have higher memory eﬃciency than the mean-ﬁeld
model, since the peak in the total number of words scales
only linearly with the size N . This is due to the fact that

The detailed analysis of the Naming Game dynam-
ics shows distinct activity patterns on homogeneous and
heterogeneous networks.
In homogeneous networks all
nodes have a similar neighborhood and therefore simi-
lar dynamical evolution, while in heterogeneous networks
classes of nodes with diﬀerent degree play diﬀerent roles
in the evolution of the Game. The role of the hubs is
better understood thanks to the degree based analysis of
the number of words and diﬀerent words. High degree
nodes, indeed, are more likely chosen as hearers and,
consequently, they have larger inventory sizes. At the
beginning, because of the pair choosing strategy (direct
Naming Game), low degree nodes are much more involved
in the process of word generation than the hubs. Local
consensus is easily reached and a large amount of locally
stable diﬀerent words get in touch with higher degree
nodes. The latter start to accumulate a large number of
words in their inventories, playing as spreaders of names
towards less connected agents and ﬁnally driving the con-
vergence. From this viewpoint, the convergence dynami-
cal pattern of the Naming Game on heterogeneous com-
plex networks presents some similarities with more stud-
ied epidemic spreading phenomena [42]. A more detailed
comparison of the activity pattern for the direct and re-
verse Naming Game is left for future work [38].

The relation between topological properties and dy-
namical evolution of the system are further characterized
by a detailed study of the eﬀects of varying the aver-
age degree and clustering coeﬃcient. These eﬀects are
equivalent on homogeneous and heterogeneous networks.
While any increase of the average degree provokes a larger
memory peak and a faster convergence, the growth of
clustering coeﬃcient leads to the decrease of the neces-
sary memory but the fast obtention of local consensus
delays in the long run the global convergence. The latter
eﬀect is particularly relevant for real social networks in
which local cohesiveness is an important feature that can-
not be neglected. Another important ingredient of real
networks that we have not addressed here is the presence
of degree correlations in the network topology. It would
indeed be interesting to know in what measure positive
or negative degree correlations aﬀect the negotiating pro-
cesses of the agents.

In summary, as other models of opinion formation [12],
the Naming Game shows a non-equilibrium dynamical
evolution from a disordered state to a state of global
agreement. However, with respect to most opinion mod-
els, in which the agents may accept or refuse to con-
form to the opinion of someone else, the Naming Game
gives more importance to the bilateral negotiation pro-
cess between pairs of agents that is a cornerstone in
the evolutionist theory of Language [1]. For this rea-
son the Naming Game should be regarded as an inde-
pendent attempt to model the ultimate emergence of a
globally accepted linguistic convention or, in other terms,
the establishment of a self-organized communication sys-

13

by few links working as bridges. Figure 16 reports the
behavior of the Naming Game on such a network, com-
posed of fully-connected cliques, each of c nodes, the var-
ious cliques being connected to each other with only one
link. From simulations it turns out that, not only the
total number of words, but even the number of diﬀerent
words display a plateau whose duration increases with
the size of the system. The number of diﬀerent words in
the plateau equals the number of communities, while the
corresponding total number of words per node is about
one, proving the existence of a real metastable state in
which the system reaches a long-lasting multi-vocabulary
conﬁguration. Indeed, each community reaches internal
consensus but the weak connections between communi-
ties are not suﬃcient for words to propagate from one
community to the other.

In conclusion, populations of agents with ﬁxed com-
plex topology do evolve towards a homogeneous state of
consensus and eﬃcient communication, except for some-
how artiﬁcial network structures, the detailed topologi-
cal properties aﬀecting only the convergence pattern and
time scale. Future work will address the important issue
of a possible interplay between topology and dynamics in
populations in which the agents are free of rearranging
their connectivity patterns in relation to local (or global)
information on the dynamical evolution of the system.
It would for example be interesting to verify if such in-
terplay may allow for a natural emergence of community
structures and multi-language cohabitation.

tem. In contrast with other non-equilibrium models, as
those based on zero-temperature Glauber dynamics or
the voter model [36, 43], we do not ﬁnd any signature of
the occurrence of metastable blocked states in any rel-
evant topology with quenched disorder. While the to-
tal number of words displays a plateau whose length in-
creases with the system size during the re-organization
phase, indeed, the number of diﬀerent words is continu-
ously decreasing, revealing that the convergence is not
a matter of ﬂuctuations due to ﬁnite-size eﬀects, but
the result of an evolving self-organizing process. Such
behavior makes the Naming Game a robust model of
self-coordinated communication in any structured pop-
ulation of agents. A noticeable exception concerns the
case of agents sitting on networks with strong commu-
nity structures, i.e. networks composed of a certain num-
ber of internally highly connected groups interconnected

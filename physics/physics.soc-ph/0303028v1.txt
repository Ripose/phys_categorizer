Abstract

In the aftermath of the burst of the “new economy” bubble in 2000, the Federal
Reserve aggressively reduced short-term rates yields in less than two years from
61/2 to 11/4 % in an attempt to coax forth a stronger recovery of the US economy.
But, there is growing apprehension that this is creating a new bubble in real es-
tate, as strong housing demand is fuelled by historically low mortgage rates. Are
we going from Charybdis to Scylla? This question is all the more excruciating at
a time when many other indicators suggest a signiﬁcant deﬂationary risk. Using
economic data, Federal Reserve Chairman A. Greenspan and Governor D.L. Kohn
dismissed recently this possibility. Using the theory of critical phenomena result-
ing from positive feedbacks in markets, we conﬁrm this view point for the US but
ﬁnd that mayhem may be in store for the UK: we unearth the unmistakable sig-
natures (log-periodicity and power law super-exponential acceleration) of a strong
unsustainable bubble there, which could burst before the end of the year 2003.

1 Introduction

While the US economy has generally been contracting in the last two years,
real estate has been growing: house prices have been rising at a rate of about 2
per cent a year faster than income gains. Real consumer outlays and spending
on residential construction each rose about 3 percent during 2001. Meanwhile,
the gross domestic product (GDP) fell about one-half percent, a drop that
would have been far worse without a strong real estate sector. While stock
market losses have destroyed maybe as much as $US 5 trillion in investor
wealth since the market’s peak, there has been an oﬀsetting eﬀect in the real
estate market. Home equity has gained about $US 1.7 trillion in the same
period, according to the chief economist for the biggest US mortgage ﬁrm,
Fannie Mae. Since, according to the Federal Reserve, home values have double
the impact on consumer spending that stock values have via the “richness
eﬀect,” the housing boom has oﬀset almost two-third of the the stock market
losses on the economy.

Such oﬀsets have triggered talks about a real estate bubble in the US. Invest-
ment weekly Barron’s claimed to spot a “bubble mentality” last April and
analysts are increasingly scrutinizing the possible evidences. A managing di-
rector of Paciﬁc Investment Management Co (PIMCO), the largest America
bond fund, agrees there is “potential for a bubble in the US residential prop-
erty market” as a result of the lowest mortgage rates since the 1960s. The
statistics released every month continue to conﬁrm that “the housing sector
continues to defy all odds,” in the words of the chief economist for the Na-
tional Association of Realtors, David Lereah. Sales of existing housing have
been and are continuing to run at a robust if not enthusiastic pace. Total
mortgage debt outstanding has risen sharply during the last decade. While
the total was about $US 2.7 trillion in the ﬁrst quarter of 1990, by the fourth
quarter of 1999, it had almost doubled, to $US 5.2 trillion. As a comparison,
the total amount of cumulative borrowing by the Federal Treasury, (the na-
tional debt), was about $US 5.7 trillion in August 2000. American mortgages
are on the path of becoming the single largest class of ﬁxed income securities
on the planet. Add to these elements that the demand for mortgage bor-
rowing outstrips aggregate domestic saving (which is currently negative and
has reached in the last months the lowest level since record keeping began in
1959). This negative saving rate combined with the continuing rapid growth of
mortgage borrowing implies that there must be a reduction in non-mortgage
lending or an increase in fund ﬂows from abroad or both [1]. This may lead
to an increased instability through globalization, resulting from the behavior
of international investors [2]. To make things look even worse, the real estate
bubble is part of a general huge credit “bubble” that has developed steadily
over the last decades, which includes the various US federal money supply,
the personal, municipal, corporate debt and federal debts (estimated by some

2

to add up to as much as several tens of trillion US dollars), which may not
only drag down the recovery of the economy but also lead to vulnerability to
exogenous crises.

But is there really a real estate bubble? The science of complexity, which
studies the emergence of organization in systems as diverse as the human
body (biology), the earth (geology) or the cosmos (astrophysics), suggests
novel insights in this troubling question. The science of complexity explains
the spontaneous occurrence of coherent large-scale collective behavior, such
as well-functioning capitalistic markets but also ﬁnancial crashes and depres-
sions, from the repeated nonlinear interactions between the constituents of
economies. This bottom-up mechanism explains the robustness and strength
of modern developed economies as well as their vulnerability to endogenous
instabilities. The theory of complex systems thus explains the origin of Adam
Smith’s invisible hand in society according to which a collection of selﬁsh
self-centered individuals coldly maximizing their individual “utility functions”
achieve an optimal aggregate social welfare. This theory explains capitalism
and free trade. However, it also explains and predicts the occurrence of insta-
bilities and of far-from-optimal equilibria, which are inherent in the bottom-up
self-organization [3].

Recent academic research in the ﬁeld of complex systems suggest that the econ-
omy as well as stock markets self-organize under the competing inﬂuences of
positive and negative feedback mechanisms ([3] and references therein). Posi-
tive feedbacks, i.e., self-reinforcement, refer for instance to the fact that, condi-
tioned on the observation that the market has recently moved up (respectively
down), this makes it more probable to keep it moving up (respectively down),
so that a large cumulative move may ensue. “Positive feedback” is the oppo-
site of “negative feedback”, the latter being a concept well-known for instance
in population dynamics in the presence of scarce resources. Rational markets
and stable economic equilibria derive from the forces of negative feedback.
When positive feedback forces dominate, deviations from equilibrium lead to
crises. Such instabilities can be seen as intrinsic endogenous progenies of the
dynamical organization of the system. Positive feedbacks lead to collective
behavior, such as herding in buys during the growth of bubbles and in sells
during a crash. This collective behavior does not require the coordination of
people to take the same action but results from the convergence of selﬁsh in-
terests together with the impact of interactions between people through the
complex network of their acquaintances.

The analysis presented below relies on a general theory of ﬁnancial crashes and
of stock market instabilities developed in a series of works. We refer to Refs. [3–
5] and references therein for all details of our approach. In a nutshell, we are
looking for signatures of a faster-than-exponential growth and its decoration
by log-periodic oscillations. The faster-than-exponential (super-exponential,

3

hyperbolic or power law) growth means that the growth rate itself grows, sig-
naling an unsustainable regime. We add the important ingredient that the
log-periodic oscillations have been found to be reliable indicators of endoge-
nous bubbles signaling a coming instability or change of regime [6]. Using these
criteria, we ﬁnd no evidence whatsoever of a bubble in the US real estate mar-
ket. However, the same analysis applied to the UK stock market shows that
these two signatures of an unsustainable bubble are unambiguously present.
Since these signatures have been found to be reliable predictors of past crashes
in ﬁnancial markets, they point to the end of the UK real estate bubble no
later than the end of the year 2003, with either a crash or a change of regime
in the UK housing market.

Technically, we ﬁt the house price indices to the following versions of the
model.

In the ﬁrst version, the logarithm of the price is given by

ln[p(t)] = A + B(tc − t)m + C(tc − t)m cos [ω log(tc − t) − φ] ,

(1)

where φ is a phase constant, 0 < m < 1 quantiﬁes the acceleration of the
price, A = log[p(tc)] and B and C are two amplitudes. B < 0 signals an up-
ward acceleration. This ﬁrst version (1) amounts to assume that the potential
correction or crash at the end of the bubble is proportional to the total price
[7].

In contrast, the second version assumes that the potential correction or crash
at the end of the bubble is proportional to the bubble part of the total price,
that is to the total price minus the fundamental price [7]. This gives the
following price evolution:

p(t) ≈ A + B(tc − t)m + C(tc − t)m cos [ω log(tc − t) − φ] .

(2)

Finally, we shall use expression (3) given below, which incorporates higher-
order harmonics beyond the ﬁrst-order log-periodic cosine of formula (1). In-
deed, the spectral Lomb analyses reported in section 2.3 suggests the presence
of a very strong harmonic at the angular log-frequency 2ω. The possible im-
portance of harmonics was also noticed and used in our recent analysis of
many stock markets in the anti-bubble regime that started worldwide during
the summer of 2000 [5,8]. This followed the analyses of log-periodicity in hy-
drodynamic turbulence data [9,10] which have demonstrated the important
role of higher harmonics in the detection of log-periodicity. In view of the par-
simony and quality of the ﬁt with expression (3), we shall use it for our test
of robustness of the estimation of the critical time tc.

2 Speculative bubble in UK real estate

2.1 Data sets

Since 1984, the Halifax House Price Index has been used extensively by gov-
ernment departments, the media and businesses as an authoritative indicator
of house price movements in the United Kingdom. This index is based on the
largest sample of housing data and provides the longest unbroken series of
any similar UK index. We use this monthly house price index data that are
retrieved from the web site of HBOS plc 2 . Six data sets are analyzed as listed
in Table 1. Each data set is a time series, which starts in December 1992 and
ends in February 2003.

2.2 Log-periodic pattern

In order to identify the speculative real estate bubble in the UK market, we ﬁt
Eq. (1) to the six data sets described in Table 1, following the ﬁtting procedure
described in details in [5].

Figure 1 shows the best ﬁts of Eq. (1) to the UK house price index for the
six data sets. For the sake of presentation, we shift the curves downward by
multiples of 0.15: the curve at the top corresponds to the set 1, the curve
immediately below translated by 0.15 vertically corresponds to set 2, the fol-
lowing curve translated again by 0.15 vertically corresponds to set 3, and so
on. The vertical lines indicate the values of the critical time tc obtained from
the ﬁt of Eq. (1) to each of the six data sets. Recall that tc is the expected
time for the end of the bubble. It corresponds to the most probable time for
a change of regime or a crash to occur [11,12]. However, a crash could still
occur before, albeit with small probability.

The log-periodic power-law signatures are clearly visible to the naked eye. The
values of the ﬁtted parameters are listed in Table 2. One observes that the
predicted tc are consistent for the six data sets and the values of the angular
log-frequencies ω indicate the existence of a fundamental angular log-frequency
around ω ≈ 5.4 and of its harmonic around ω ≈ 12.2.

Figure 2 presents the best ﬁts of Eq. (2) to the UK house price index (and not
their logarithm as in Figure 1) for the six data sets described in Table 1. We
also translate the curves as in Figure 1 in the same way with a vertical shift
of 35 downward for each successive curve. Again, the vertical lines indicate

2 http://www.hbosplc.com/view/housepriceindex/housepriceindex.asp.

5

the positions of the critical times tc for each data set. The log-periodic power-
law signatures are again clearly visible. The values of the ﬁtted parameters are
given in Table 3. While the predicted critical times tc are still quite consistent,
they exhibit a signiﬁcantly larger scatter than when using Eq. (1), suggesting
that the bubble is better described by a pure speculative component given by
Eq. (1). This conclusion is strengthened by the fact that the ﬁts with Eq. (2)
give negative exponents m, corresponding to a divergence of the price (in con-
trast with the divergence of the change of trend of the price described by the
ﬁts with Eq. (1)). Eq. (1) seems thus more consistent with a reasonable price
trajectory, exhibiting super-exponential acceleration, but culminating at a ﬁ-
nite value with inﬁnite unsustainable slope. This again suggests a very strong
component of the bubble component to the price, making the fundamental
component undetectable in this analysis.

In contrast, the found angular log-frequencies ω are very robust with respect to
the choice of Eq. (1) versus Eq. (2) and retrieve a fundamental value ω ≈ 5 −6
and its harmonic ω ≈ 12. This conﬁrms to us the existence of a very clear
speculative signal in these price time series. The consistency of the results
across the six diﬀerent ways of calculating the House price indices also sug-
gests that we are deciphering here a very strong speculative component of the
dynamics of house prices, which remain robust whatever the speciﬁc nature
of the house and the way they are estimated.

2.3 Signiﬁcance of the log-periodic patterns

To assess the signiﬁcance level of the extracted log-periodic pattern, we com-
plement the parametric analysis of Eq. (1) and Eq. (2) with non-parametric
analyses.

For our ﬁrst test, we use the ﬁrst two terms A + B(tc − t)m of the right-
hand-side of equation (1) to detrend ln[p(t)], that is, we construct the residual
{ln[p(t)] − A − B(tc − t)m}/(tc − t)m, in the manner introduced in Ref. [11].
A perfect sinusoidal log-periodicity would correspond to this residual being a
perfect cosine cos [ω log(tc − t) + φ]. In order to quantify the log-periodic oscil-
latory components of the six time series, we calculate the Lomb periodograms
(which are similar to a Fourier transform for unevenly spaced data) of the
corresponding residues for the six data sets.

Figure 3 gives the Lomb periodograms of the detrended residuals of the six
house prices and their Lomb average as the thickest line. All periodograms
present two signiﬁcant peaks around ω1 = 5.2 and a value ω2 = 12.1 close to
its harmonics 2ω1.

Our second test consists in performing non-parametrically the (H, q)-analysis

6

of the logarithm of the price as described in Ref. [13,5]. In a nutshell, the (H, q)-
analysis performs a kind of fractal derivative which is particularly sensitive to
the presence of log-periodicity. The index q refers to the discrete scaling ratio
used in the deﬁnition of the fractal q-derivative. The index H is the exponent
used to rescale the q-derivative. Scanning q and H provides an important test
of the robustness of the log-periodic signal. A Lomb periodogram analysis
of the (H, q)-derivative allows one to detect the presence of signiﬁcant log-
periodicity. Figure 4 shows the angular log-frequency ω of the most signiﬁcant
Lomb peak in each lomb periodogram for each of the scanned (H, q) pairs
of (H, q)-derivative [13,14] of the logarithm of the price of one of the house
price index. The middle and high plateaus show respectively the fundamental
log-frequency and its harmonic. The lower level corresponds to the artiﬁcial
log-frequency corresponding to the most probable noise of a power law signal
demonstrated in Ref. [15].

The analysis of the power law residual and the (H, q)-analysis conﬁrm the
presence of very signiﬁcant log-periodicity in the UK house price indices over
the last decade.

2.4 Parametric ﬁt taking into account the second log-periodic harmonics

Figures 3 and 4 have demonstrated the strong amplitude of a second log-
periodic harmonic. Similarly to our previous modelling of the stock markets
[5,8], we extend (1) into

ln[p(t)] = A + Bτ m + CRe

−m−0.5eiψnτ
n

−sn

,

!

N

 

Xn=1

where τ = (tc − t)/T (T determines the time units), A, B and C are three
parameters, N is the number of log-periodic harmonics kept in the description
and

(3)

(4)

sn = −m + i

n .

2π
ln γ

The operator Re(x) takes the real part of x. In the second term of the right-
hand-side of (3), we have used sn=0 = −m as seen from (4). Note that the case
N = 1 recovers Eq. (1). We call the function (3) a Weierstrass-type function
[17].

Since the choice ψn = 0 plays an essential role in the modelling of ﬁnancial
time series in the bubble and/or anti-bubble regimes as shown in[16,17], we
use Eq. (3) with ψn = 0 and follow the procedure described in [16] to ﬁt the

7

six data sets. This choice, which corresponds to have the same phases for all
harmonics, has also the advantage of keeping constant the number of degrees
of freedom such that the more complex formula (3) has the same number of
free parameters as the simplest log-periodic equation (1). By this model (3),
we thus gain in relevance while keeping the same parsimony.

Figure 5 shows the best ﬁts of Eq. (3) with ψn = 0 and N = 2 to the six
UK house price indices described in Table 1. The log-periodic signatures are
again clearly visible. The values of the ﬁtted parameters are listed in Table 4.
Compared with Table 2, one can see that the present ﬁts give much better
goodness-of-ﬁt with smaller r.m.s. errors. Since they have the same number
of free parameters, formula (3) should be prefered as a better model than
equation (1). The angular log-frequency is now found to be stable and close
to the fundamental value around 6 identiﬁed in previous ﬁts. This is because
expression (3) automatically accounts for higher harmonics up to order N − 1.
This result strengthens the existence and evidence for strong log-periodicity
harmonics. The exponents m and critical time tc are consistent across the
six time series. Taking into account higher-order harmonics N > 2 does not
improve the ﬁts signiﬁcantly due to the coarse monthly sampling rate and the
marginal importance of the third-order and four-order log-periodic harmonics
shown in Figure 3.

2.5 Test of the robustness of the critical time tc

The determination of tc is particularly important as it gives the estimated
termination time of the speculative bubble as well as the most probable time
for a crash, if any. Beyond tc, the speculative bubble has to transform into an-
other regime because its path before and up to tc has become unsustainable.
We stress that several models of stochastic speculative bubbles indicate that
a bubble does not end necessarily with a crash as there is a ﬁnite probability
for a bubble to end by a transition to another regime such as slow deﬂation
[11,12,18]. tc is thus not the time of the crash, it is both the end of the bubble
and the time at which the crash is most probable, if it ever occurs. Neverthe-
less, there is an obvious interest in estimating when the speculative trend of
the real estate bubble in the UK will end up.

As an attempt to address this question, we investigate the robustness of the
estimated critical time tc obtained from the previous ﬁts. For this, we perform
again ﬁts with Eq. (3) of the six time series from December 1992 to a time tlast
and vary tlast to see if tc has remained approximately constant in the past. For
each tlast, we report in Figure 6 the value tc of the best ﬁt with Eq. (3) for each
of the 6 time series. Except for time series 2 (all, non seasonally adjusted), all
other 5 seasonally adjusted time series are grossly consistent with a critical

8

time tc that could fall anywhere from the present to the end of the year 2003.

Figure 6 conveys two pieces of information. First, the description of the data
with the log-periodic formula (3) with two log-frequencies is found approxi-
mately stable as a function of time. Second, the precision with which one can
pinpoint the speciﬁc end of the presently unfolding speculative bubble in the
UK house prices is limited. In this vein, the behavior of the critical time tc
predicted with time series 2 (all, non seasonally adjusted) is instructive: af-
ter a plateau, tc is found to grow systematically with tlast. This is a property
which has been found in past investigations (see Chapter 9 of [3]) to be due
to the fact that the real end of the bubble is beyond the time horizon over
which the log-periodic ﬁts provide reliable predictors. When using only the
ﬁrst log-periodic harmonics with expression (1), a monotonous increase of the
predicted tc’s with tlast is found for all 6 time series, which is similar to that
found with time series 2 using Eq. (3). Together with the results shown in
Figure 6, this conﬁrms the stronger relevance of Eq. (3): the addition of a
second log-periodic harmonics seems to extend the time-horizon over which
forecasts are stable. This also shows that the true end of the bubble is beyond
the time horizon of formula (1).

3 Exponential growth in the USA real estate market

Figure 7 shows the average sales prices p(t) of new houses sorted by regions
(northeast, midwest, south and west and all the states in the USA) in the
last decade as a function of time t. The data are taken from the U.S. Census
Bureau 3 . The linear dependence of ln[p(t)] against t in this semi-log plot
qualiﬁes clearly an exponential growth

p(t) = p(0) ert ,

(5)

with a constant growth rate r. The yearly growth rates found by linearly
regressing ln p(t) against time are 4.1% (northeast), 5.3% (midwest), 3.9%
(south), 3.9% (west) and 4.7% (all states).

Using expression (1) to ﬁt these same data sets since December 1992 to De-
cember 2002, we ﬁnd absolutely no signiﬁcant log-periodicity and no power-
law criticality in the investigated price trajectory. According to the proposal
[18,3,6] that speculative bubbles are associated with super-exponential growth
with signiﬁcant log-periodicity, the recent house price time series in the US
do not qualify as bubbles.

3 http://www.census.gov/const/www/newressalesindex.html.

9

This conclusion is maybe strengthened by taking a bird’s view. Figure 8 shows
the median 4 sales price p(t) of new houses sold in the USA as a function of
time t since 1963. Four time periods with exponential growth in the price
can be identiﬁed, and are illustrated by the straight lines in Figure 8. The
decreasing period from August 1969 to June 1970 is not included in the ﬁts.
The four selected time periods with exponential growth are shown by the
range of the corresponding straight lines. Going from the past to present, the
yearly growth rates for the four periods shown in Figure 8 are respectively
6.3%, 11.4, 6.8% and 4.0%. It thus seems that the last decade has witnessed
a slower average growth rate of real estate prices compared with the average
growth rate from 1963 to 1990. The most recent evolution of the house prices
is in line with the past decade evolution and, rather than showing exuberance,
the house prices have shifted to a smaller rate in the decade in which the USA
economy and especially its stock market boomed. The only quantitative signal
that the US market may be “heating up” lies in a detectable increase in the
volatility of house prices in the last two years.

4 Conclusion

Testifying before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Af-
fairs in July 2002, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan told
lawmakers that rising home prices in the USA are a by-product of “low mort-
gage rates, immigration, and shortages of buildable land in some areas.” As
a result, homeowners have more equity they can use to pay oﬀ high-cost con-
sumer debt and for other purposes. This leads to a beneﬁcial eﬀect on the US
economy rather than suggesting the possibility of a real estate crash.

Based on the science of complexity, our analysis provides a conﬁrmation of
this conclusion derived from more standard economic analysis.

The situation is the opposite for the UK market. Our same analysis applied
to the UK real estate market shows two unambiguous signatures of an unsus-
tainable bubble, which started years even before the end of the stock market
bubble in 2000. These signatures have been found to be reliable predictors of
past crashes in ﬁnancial markets. The analysis points to the end of the bubble
before the end of the year 2003, with either a crash or a change of direction
in the UK housing market. While there are very strong correlations between
stock markets in developed countries at present [8], no such correlation has yet
materialized in real estate markets. Investors should however remain watchful
for indications of a possible contagions to the US in the longer term.

4 We use median prices rather than averages as the time series of median prices
extends further in the past. The average prices are available only after 1975.

10

To summarize, what we have learned in this paper is that (1) the USA real
estate market is in a “rational expectation” regime; (2) the UK real-estate
market exhibits an ultimately unsustainable speculative bubble; (3) The UK
house prices will continue going up during most of the year 2003; and (4) The
Weierstrass-type function (3) outperforms the simple log-periodic power law
formula.

south and west and all the states in USA) in the last decade as a function of time
t in a semi-log representation. The linear dependence of ln[p(t)] against t implies
a stable exponential growth. The yearly growth rates are 4.1% (northeast), 5.3%
(midwest), 3.9% (south), 3.9% (west) and 4.7% (all states).

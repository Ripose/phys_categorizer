Abstract

In this paper we give deﬁnitions of matrix rates of return which do not depend on the choice

of basis describing baskets. We give their economic interpretation. The matrix rate of return

describes baskets of arbitrary type and extends portfolio analysis to the complex variable domain.

This allows us for simultaneous analysis of evolution of baskets parameterized by complex variables

in both continuous and discrete time models.

INTRODUCTION

The goal of capital investment is the maximization of a proﬁt and minimization of

possible losses. This goal cannot be achieved by investing of the whole capital in the most

proﬁtable enterprises. Such situations do not happen. The future proﬁt of a market in-

vestment is uncertain, therefore, the investor creates composite baskets consisting of capital

investments of possibly most diversiﬁed character. This kind of procedure diversiﬁes the

risk of enterprise. The description of the evolution of multidimensional capital of this kind

is essential to quantitative analysis of the correlations related with investment processes, in

particular, these for which the tools of traditional ﬁnancial mathematics are unapplicable.

Depending on the point of view, in every capital basket we can, besides of quantitative

changes of individual components, observe the ﬂows between its components. The ﬂows of

capital can be recorded even if no decisions about capital operations are taken. Such situ-

ations require matrix description and enforce the generalizations of the calculus of interest

rates in such a way that they are sensitive to both quantitative changes of individual ele-

ments and ﬂows between them. This situation leads inevitably to the matrix generalization

of the interest rate calculus, see [1].

II. LINEAR HOMOGENEOUS CAPITAL PROCESS

Let us consider a capital of a banker which is a mixture of two elements: k1 – an amount
lent to client, k2 – the remaining of assets. Let the variable l ∈ Z denote arbitrary time
interval. The process of change of the banker’s capital related with the amounts k1 and k2

can be described as follows

k1(l): According to the rate of interest α1(l) at which the banker gave credit, the growth of

the component k1 is equal to α1(l)k1(l). In addition the amount of unreturned part of

credit decreases by the value of repayment β(l)k1(l) which is determined by the rate

β(l).

k2(l): The capital k2 increases by the amount of repayment of credit β(l)k1(l). Being in

addition placed in, for example liquid stocks of annual rate of return α2(l), it grows

by the amount α2(l)k2(l).

2

The components of the banker’s capital do form a basket k(l) = (k1(l), k2(l)). It is repre-
sented by an element of the two dimensional real vector space R2. The evolution of this
basket during the time l ∈ Z can be described by the system of equations

k1(l + 1) = (1 + α1(l) − β(l)) k1(l)




k2(l + 1) =

β(l) k1(l) + (1 + α2(l)) k2(l)

.

(1)

We interpret the negative values of components of the basket km, m = 1, 2, . . . as debts of



the banker.

The nonlinear (with respect to the remaining debt) repayment rates, that is for example

the costs of service of credit or taxes, can be presented in a form of linear repayment, after

appropriate modiﬁcation of the factor β(l). In particular various borrower’s obligations to

the banker can be taken into account with the help of the expression in variable proportion to

the amount of paid-oﬀ credit. This enables us to apply our formalism in much wider context.

This evolution of the capital can be described in such a way that any changes of components

of the basket are expressed as percent changes of those components. In the vector space of

baskets we can choose a new basis such that we do not observe any ﬂows of capital, but

autonomous growth of individual components only. Let us assume that α1(l) 6= α2(l) and

′

k

1(l) is as in previous basis, the amount of the capital lent to client k
2(l) is
the sum of β(l) part of a loan and α2(l) − α1(l) + β(l) part of remaining banker’s assets.

1(l) = k1(l) . k

′

′

That is k

2(l) = β(l)k1(l) + (α2(l) − α1(l) + β(l))k2(l). In these new variables equations (1),

′

describing the changes in the basket separate and take the following form:

1(l + 1) = (1 + α1(l) − β(l)) k
(1 + α2(l)) k
2(l + 1) =

1(l)

.





In this way we do not observe any ﬂows of capital and the components k

basket grow according to the rates of interest α1(l)−β(l) and α2(l) for k

2 respectively.
The formalism of ﬁnancial mathematics should not depend on choice of basis to describe the

1 and k

baskets. It seems that the matrix rates presented below are necessary to obtain the basis

III. THE MATRIX RATE OF RETURN

Capital processes are described by linear homogeneous diﬀerence equations. In the matrix

notation they take the form:

k(l + 1) − k(l) = R(l) k(l) , hence k(l + 1) = (I + R(l)) k(l) ,

(2)

where k(l) ∈ RM , R(l) and I are real matrices of dimension M × M. I denotes the unit

matrix. Matrix R(l) is called the matrix credit rate of return or the matrix lower rate. The

adjective lower refers to the way of the description of the growth of the vector k(l). These

changes are expressed as the eﬀects of linear transformations applied to the vector k(l) of
the basket in the moment l prior to this change. The space RM of all possible baskets, is

called the phase space of baskets and linear homogeneous diﬀerence or diﬀerential systems

of equations of ﬁrst order are called equations of motion of the basket. For M = 2 the matrix

R(l) generating the evolution (1) equals to

If the state of the basket in the initial moment p equals to k(p), then the solution of the

evolution equation (2) takes the form

R(l) =

to use the standard calculus of interest rates depends on way of description of the basket,

that is on choice of a basis in our language. For this reason, in order to obtain an invari-

ant description, the rate of growth R(l) is promoted to a composite object with deﬁnite

transformation rules corresponding to the changes of reference frame (an observer).

4

Let us consider processes for which the matrix I + R(l) is nonsingular. Then, introducing

the concept of the matrix discount rate of return or the matrix upper rate R(l), it is possible

rewrite the equation of motion (2) in the following form:

k(l + 1) − k(l) = R(l) k(l + 1) .

Comparing formulae (2) and (5) we obtain the relation between both types of matrix rates

introduced above:

(I + R(l))

I − R(l)

=

I − R(l)

(I + R(l)) = I .

Solving the above equation with respect to R(l) we obtain

(cid:1)

(cid:0)

R(l) = R(l) + R

(l) + R

(l) + . . . .

(cid:1)

3

From the point of view of capitalisation from upper, we can interpret the above formulae as

the contribution of discount rate into increase of capital by summation of all interests from

interests (the geometrical sequence). According to Eq. (7) the formulae for R(l) takes the

form −R(l) = (−R(l)) + (−R(l))2 + (−R(l))3 + . . . . Notice that for ﬁxed argument l the

matrix rates are commuting.

When we perform the formal change of the direction of time the credit and discount rate

change their signs and they change their roles. Therefore, the formulae containing these

matrices are symmetric with respect to the time reﬂection. The appropriate formulae for

(4) can be obtained with the help of (6) as the solution of the equation of motion:

where T

is the antichronological operator which orders matrix rates in the direction opposite

If the matrix rates at diﬀerent moments of time commute, that is in the case of M = 1 or

for any M if matrix rates are time-independent, we can neglect the operators T and T

in

the solutions (4) and (8).

INTERPRETATION THE MATRIX RATE OF RETURN

The matrix rate of return R(l) = (Rmn(l)) can be given as sum of two matrices R(l) =
C(l) + D(l), with C(l) the matrix of ﬂows (the name is justiﬁed by the property that sum

5

of the elements of each column is equal zero) and D(l) – the diagonal matrix called the

matrix of growths. This decomposition is unique, when the basis is ﬁxed. Introduction of

the matrix rate of return is essential, when we cannot transform the matrix C(l) to matrix

zero. Moreover, the oﬀ-diagonal elements of the matrix R(l), Rmn(l) for m 6= n, see Eq.
(3), describe which part of capital of the n-th component of the basket ﬂows to the m-th

component of the basket. Diagonal elements Rmm(l) describe the growths. The rate of

growth of the m-th component of the basket equals αm(l) = Rmm(l) −

m6=n Rnm(l), that
is, the diagonal element corrected by all out-ﬂows of the capitals related to the component

P

km(l).

A. Example

(i) Let us restrict the process from section II to the cases when β(l) = 0 and the coeﬃcients

αi do not depend on time l and the second coeﬃcient is two times bigger than the ﬁrst

one. Then the matrix lower rate is equal to R =

dimensional subspaces of the phase space – the classical concept of interest rates is

applicable here.

(ii) We can look at this process in a diﬀerent way. Namely by describing it in the coordinates

in the new basis in the space of baskets. Let the reference basis consist of client’s debts

and all banker’s capital assets. Then the equation of motion of the basket (1) takes

the form

k1(l + 1) = (1 + α)

k1(l)




k1(l) + (1 + 2α)

The matrix of ﬂows determined by the above equation is non zero now. The matrix

respectively. The debt of a client ˜k1 changes in a similar way to the previous example,

though not as result of an autonomic growth, but due to an outﬂow of the banker’s

capital. Banker’s capital grows according to the same rate as investment k2(l).

(iii) In the basis given by Eq. (6) the matrix upper rate for the equation of motion (9)

takes the form

R =



Diﬀerent points of view at the same capital process presented in (i), (ii), (ii) are equally

correct and sensible. Comparing the credit convention in variant (ii) with the discount

convention (iii) we can note the essential diﬀerence between the matrices D and D. Growth

of ﬁrst component is only the eﬀect of ﬂows in the ﬁrst case while in second case this

component has partial autonomy in its growth. The indicated diﬀerence in interpretation

can be a reason of many ﬁnancial embezzlement, exactly in the same way as it happens in

case of nonpayment of interests of overdue interests in simple capitalisation. We will refer

the asymmetry of this kind in the description of ﬂows as the paradox of diﬀerence rates.

The interpretation of the matrix rate R is analogous to that of the matrix R with the

only diﬀerence that the rate R deﬁnes the capital changes with respect to the oncoming

moment of the settlement of accounts. The convention of discount replaces the convention

of credit. The free choice of convention is not possible for nonreversible processes i.e. when

the matrices R and R are singular.

V. THE FORMALISM OF CONTINUOUS DESCRIPTION OF CREDIT

For the capital calculus to be transparent and readable for practitioners the formal so-

lution of the equation of motion (2) can be modeled numerically or presented it in dense

form with the help of the limiting process which transforms the discrete models described

by linear diﬀerence equations into continuous ones with diﬀerential equations. Assume that

we consider time scales such that the periods of time between the changes of components of

7

the basket is inﬁnitesimal and equals to τ = tl+1 − tl. After rescaling of the time domain of

the basket the equation of motion (2) takes the form:

k(tl + τ ) − k(tl)
τ

=

R(l)
τ

k(tl) .

In the limit τ → 0 we obtain

dk(t)
dt

= R(t) k(t) where R(t) := lim
τ →0

R(l)
τ

|t=tl.

Matrix R(t) is called the diﬀerential matrix rate of return.

The formal solution of the equation (10) is given by the formula

k(t) =

If the diﬀerential matrix rate is constant, the chronological operator T is the identity. The

the basket becomes transformed to the standard matrix exponential function T e

VI. COMPLEX RATE OF RETURN

Let us consider baskets which have oscillating components. Part of their capital becomes

a debt at some moment and a desirable good at another time. This phenomenon is called

pumping of capital in the language of ﬁnancial market. Evolution of basket of this kind is

described by one of the most popular model of physics – the harmonic oscillator. Let us

consider the diﬀerential matrix rate

R(t) =

0 −b



=

It is easy to imagine the corresponding bank contracts leading to the ﬂows of capital in basket

and autonomic increases of components of the basket generated by these ﬂows. Let us con-
sider the complex extension C2 of the phase space R2. Then

k1 = (1, i) and

k2 = (1, −i) =

8

e

e

k∗

e

are the eigenvectors of the matrix rate R(t) with eigenvalues −i b and i b respectively. The

description of process is simpliﬁed because the basket splits into two independent compo-

nents with abstract complex capital. Although that baskets of the complex capital are the

abstract concepts, they have the interpretation in the real basis due to matrix of transition.

The equation of motion of the basket in the basis of eigenvectors {

k1,

k2} takes the form:

k1(t) = e−ib(t−t0)

k1(t0)

,

k2(t) = eib(t−t0)

e
e
k2(t0) .

In the initial, real basis one has

cos(b(t − t0)) − sin(b(t − t0))

k(t) =





sin(b(t − t0))

k(t0) .

cos(b(t − t0)) 


This equation describes motion along the circle centered at the beginning of the cartesian

coordinates of the basket. The period of return to the same point of the phase space equals
to T = 2π
|b| .

VII. THE INDEFINITE MATRIX RATE

We deﬁne the indeﬁnite logarithm, see [2], to be a mathematical object representing the

abstract concept of the logarithm with an unﬁxed base. For any given real number x > 0, the

indeﬁnite logarithm of x written as [log x], is a special type of mathematical object called a

logarithmic quantity object, which we deﬁne as follows [2]:

[log x] := {(b, y)|b > 0, y = log b x} .

Indeﬁnite logarithmic quantities are inherently scale-free objects, that is, they are non-scalar

quantities and they can serve as a basis for logarithmic spaces, which are natural systems

of logarithmic units suitable for measuring any quantity deﬁned on a logarithmic scale.

Although the above deﬁnition is restricted to positive real numbers, it could be extended

to non-zero complex numbers too. The concept of the rate of interest is connected with the

time scale. To get rid of explicit time scale dependence we introduce the indeﬁnite matrix

rate, which is the generalization of the indeﬁnite logarithm to the multidimensional case:

In the above deﬁnition the argument of the logarithm is a matrix.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS

Every matrix can be deformed to a diagonalizable complex matrix by arbitrarily small

deformations of their elements [3][4], that is the set of diagonalizable linear transformations
of the complexiﬁed phase space CM is dense in the space all linear maps of CM . From the

above it follows that, the evolution of every capital basket can be represented as set of non

interacting complex capital investments. Therefore, in the complex extended phase space the

decomposition of the matrix rate R(t) = C(t) + D(t) can always be done in such a way that

the matrix of ﬂows is zero. As in traditional ﬁnancial mathematics the real parts of nonzero

elements of a diagonal matrix rate measure the loss or gain of complex investments. The

imaginary parts inform about periodicity of changes in proportion between real component

of complex investments and its imaginary partner. To every periodic changes of proportion

of the elements of the complex components of capital there will correspond its complex

conjugated partner. The evolution of real capital of basket is most easily observed in terms

of its components with respect to the basis of eigenvectors of matrix rates.

By the choice of appropriate moments of entering and exit from capital process the

oscillations like above can be used as particularly eﬀective mechanism of enlarging of the

capital giving the similar results as ﬁnancial leverage.

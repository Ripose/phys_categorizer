Limitations of scaling and universality in stock market data

J´anos Kert´esz∗ and Zolt´an Eisler†
Department of Theoretical Physics, Budapest University of Technology and Economics, Budapest, Hungary

We present evidence, that if a large enough set of high resolution stock market data is analyzed,
certain analogies with physics – such as scaling and universality – fail to capture the full complexity
of such data. Despite earlier expectations, the mean value per trade, the mean number of trades
per minute and the mean trading activity do not show scaling with company capitalization, there is
only a non-trivial monotonous dependence. The strength of correlations present in the time series
of traded value is found to be non-universal: The Hurst exponent increases logarithmically with
capitalization. A similar trend is displayed by intertrade time intervals. This is a clear indication
that stylized facts need not be fully universal, but can instead have a well-deﬁned dependence on
company size.

In the last decade, an increasing number of physicists is
becoming devoted to the study of economic and ﬁnancial
phenomena [1, 2, 3]. One of the reasons for this tendency
is that societies or stock markets can be seen as strongly
interacting systems. Since the early 70’s, physics has
developed a wide range of concepts and models to eﬃ-
ciently treat such topics, these include (fractal and mul-
tifractal) scaling, frustrated disordered systems, and far
from equilibrium phenomena. To understand how simi-
larly complex patterns arise from human activity, albeit
truly challenging, seems a natural continuation of such
eﬀorts.

While a remarkable success has been achieved [4, 5, 6],
studies in econophysics are often rooted in possible analo-
gies, even though there are important diﬀerences between
physical and ﬁnancial systems. Despite the obvious sim-
ilarities to interacting systems here we would like to em-
phasize the discrepancy in the levels of description. For
example, in the case of a physical system undergoing a
second order phase transition, it is natural to assume
scaling on profound theoretical grounds and the (experi-
mental or theoretical) determination of, e.g., the critical
exponents is a fully justiﬁed undertaking. There is no
similar theoretical basis for the ﬁnancial market what-
soever, therefore in this case the assumption of power
laws should be considered only as one possible way of ﬁt-
ting fat tailed distributions [7, 8]. Also, the reference to
universality should not be plausible as the robustness of
qualitative features – like the fat tail of the distributions
– is a much weaker property. While we fully acknowl-
edge the process of understanding based on analogies as
an important method of scientiﬁc progress, we empha-
size that special care has to be taken in cases where the
theoretical support is sparse.

The aim of this paper is to summarize some recent
advances that help to understand these fundamental dif-
ferences. We present evidence, that the size of companies
strongly aﬀects the characteristics of trading activity of

versity of Technology, Espoo, Finland

their stocks, in a way which is incompatible with the
popular assumption of universality in trading dynamics.
Instead, certain stylized facts have a well-deﬁned depen-
dence on company capitalization. Therefore, e.g., av-
eraging distributions over companies with very diﬀerent
capitalization is questionable.

The paper is organized as follows. Section I introduces
the notations and data that were used. Section II shows
that various measures of trading activity depend on capi-
talization in a non-trivial way. In Sec. III, we analyze the
correlations present in traded value time series, and ﬁnd
that the Hurst exponent increases with the mean traded
value per minute logarithmically. Section IV deals with
a similar size-dependence of correlations present in the
time intervals between trades. Finally, Section V con-
cludes.

I. NOTATIONS AND DATA

For time windows of size ∆t, let us write the total
traded value (activity, ﬂow) of the ith stock at time t as

f ∆t
i

(t) =

Vi(n),

(1)

Xn,ti(n)∈[t,t+∆t]

where ti(n) is the time of the n-th transaction of the
i-th stock. This corresponds to the coarse-graining of
the individual events, or the so-called tick-by-tick data.
Vi(n) is the value traded in transaction n, and it can be
calculated as the product of the price p and the traded
volume of stocks ˜V ,

Vi(n) = pi(n) ˜Vi(n).

(2)

Price does not change very much from trade to trade,
so the dominant factor in the ﬂuctuations and the sta-
tistical properties of f is given by the variation of the
number of stocks exchanged in the transactions, ˜V . Price
serves as a conversion factor to a common unit (US dol-
lars), and it makes the comparison of stocks possible,
while also automatically corrects the data for stock splits.
The statistical properties (normalized distribution, corre-
lations, etc.) are otherwise practically indistinguishable
between traded volume and traded value.

We used empirical data from the TAQ database [9]
which records all transactions of the New York Stock Ex-
change and NASDAQ for the years 1993 − 2003.

Finally, note that throughout the paper we use 10-base

logarithms.

II. CAPITALIZATION AFFECTS BASIC
MEASURES OF TRADING ACTIVITY

Most previous studies are restricted to an analysis of
the stocks of large companies. These are traded fre-
quently, and so price and returns are well deﬁned even on
the time scale of a few seconds. Nevertheless, other quan-
tities regarding the activity of trading, such as traded
value and volume or the number of trades can be deﬁned,
even for those stocks where they are zero for most of the
time.
In this section we extend the study of Zumbach
[10] which concerned the 100 large companies included in
London Stock Exchange’s FTSE-100 market index. This
set spans about two orders of magnitude in capitaliza-
tion. Instead, we analyze the 3347 stocks[28] that were
traded continuously at NYSE for the year 2000. This
gives us a substantially larger range of capitalization, ap-
proximately 106 . . . 6 · 1011 USD.

Following Ref. [10], in order to quantify how the value
of the capitalization Ci of a company is reﬂected in the
trading activity of its stock, we plotted the mean value
per trade hVii, mean number of trades per minute hNii
and mean activity (traded value per minute) hfii versus
capitalization in Fig. 1. Ref.
[10] found that all three
quantities have power law dependence on Ci, however,
this simple ansatz does not seem to work for our extended
range of stocks. While mean trading activity can be – to
a reasonable quality – approximated as hfii ∝ C0.98±0.06
,
neither hV i nor hN i can be ﬁtted by a single power law
in the whole range of capitalization. Nevertheless, there
is an unsurprising monotonous dependence: higher capi-
talized stocks are traded more intensively.

i

One can gain further insight from Fig. 1(d), which
eliminates the capitalization variable, and shows hV i ver-
sus hN i. For the largest 1600 stocks we ﬁnd the scaling
relation

hVii ∝ hNiiβ ,

(3)

with β = 0.57 ± 0.09. The estimate based on the results
of Zumbach [10] for the stocks in London’s FTSE-100, is
β ≈ 1, while Ref. [11] ﬁnds β = 0.22±0.04 for NASDAQ.
The regime of smaller stocks shows no clear tendency.

One possible interpretation of the eﬀect is the follow-
ing. Smaller stocks are exchanged rarely, but there must
exist a smallest exchanged value that is still proﬁtable
to use due to transaction costs, hV i cannot decrease in-
deﬁnitely. On the other hand, once a stock is exchanged
more often (the change happens at about hN i = 0.05
trades/min), it is no more traded in this minimal prof-
itable unit. With more intensive trading, trades ”stick

2

together”, liquidity allows the exchange of larger pack-
ages. This increase is clear, but not very large, up to one
order of magnitude. Although increasing package sizes
reduce transaction costs, price impact [12, 13, 14, 15] in-
creases, and proﬁts will decrease again. The balance be-
tween these two eﬀects can determine package sizes and
may play a role in the formation of (3).

III. NON-UNIVERSAL CORRELATIONS OF
TRADED VALUE

Scaling methods [16, 17, 18] have long been used to
characterize stock market time series, including prices
and trading volumes [4, 5]. In particular, the Hurst ex-
ponent H(i) is often calculated. For the traded value
time series f ∆t

(t) of stock i, it can be deﬁned as

i

i (∆t) =

(t) −

i

(t)

∝ ∆t2H(i),

(4)

D(cid:0)

(cid:11)(cid:1)

(cid:10)
where h·i denotes time averaging with respect to t. The
signal is said to be correlated (persistent) when H > 0.5,
uncorrelated when H = 0.5, and anticorrelated (antiper-
sistent) for H < 0.5. It is not a trivial fact, but several
recent papers [19, 20] point out that the variance on the
left hand side exists for any stock’s traded value and any
time scale ∆t. Therefore, we carried out measurements
of H on all 2647 stocks that were continuously traded on
NYSE in the period 2000 − 2002. We investigated sepa-
rately the 4039 stocks that were traded at NASDAQ for
the same period.

[21].

We ﬁnd, that stock market activity has a much richer
behavior, than simply all stocks having Hurst expo-
nents statistically distributed around an average value,
as assumed in Ref.
Instead, there is a crossover
[19, 22, 23] between two types of behavior around the
time scale of a few hours to 1 trading day. An essentially
uncorrelated regime was found when ∆t < 20 min for
NYSE and ∆t < 2 min for NASDAQ, while the time se-
ries of larger companies become strongly correlated when
∆t > 300 min for NYSE and ∆t > 60 min for NASDAQ.
As a reference, we also calculated the Hurst exponents
Hshuf f (i) of the shuﬄed time series. The results are
plotted in Fig. 2.

One can see, that for shorter time windows, correla-
tions are absent in both markets, H(i) ≈ 0.51 − 0.53.
For windows longer than a trading day, however, while
small hf i stocks again display only very weak correla-
tions, larger ones show up to H ≈ 0.9. Furthermore,
there is a distinct logarithmic trend in the data:

H(i) = H ∗ + γ log hfii ,

(5)

with γ(∆t > 300min) = 0.06 ± 0.01 for NYSE and
γ(∆t > 60min) = 0.05 ± 0.01 for NASDAQ. This re-
sult can be predicted by a general framework based on a
new type of scaling law [11, 24]. Shorter time scales cor-
respond to the special case γ = 0, there is no systematic
trend in H. After shuﬄing the time series, as expected,

they become uncorrelated and show Hshuf f (i) ≈ 0.5 at
all time scales and without signiﬁcant dependence on hfii.

It is to be emphasized, that the crossover is not simply
between uncorrelated and correlated regimes.
It is in-
stead between homogeneous (all stocks show H(i) ≈ H1,
γ = 0) and inhomogeneous (γ > 0) behavior. One ﬁnds
H1 ≈ 0.5, but very small hf i stocks do not depart much
from this value even for large time windows. This is a
clear relation to company size, as hf i is a monotonously
growing function of company capitalization (see Sec. II
and Ref. [19]).

Dependence of the eﬀect on hf i is in fact a depen-
dence on company size. This is a direct evidence of
non-universality. The trading mechanism that governs
the marketplace depends strongly on the stock that is
traded.
In a physical sense, there are no universality
classes [25] comprising a given group of stocks and char-
acterized by a set of stylized facts, such as Hurst expo-
nents. Instead, there is a continuous spectrum of com-
pany sizes and the stylized facts may depend continuously
on company size/capitalization.

Systematic dependence of the exponent of the power
spectrum of the number of trades on capitalization was
previously reported in Ref.
[26], based on the study of
88 stocks. That quantity is closely related to the Hurst
[22]).
exponent of the respective time series (see Ref.
Direct analysis ﬁnds a strong, monotonous increase of
the Hurst exponent of N with growing hN i, but no such
clear logarithmic trend as Eq. (5).

IV. NON-UNIVERSAL CORRELATIONS OF
INTERTRADE TIMES

To strengthen the arguments of Sec.

III, we carried
out a a similar analysis of the intertrade interval series
Ti(n = 1 . . . Ni − 1), deﬁned as the time spacings between
the n’th and n + 1’th trade. Ni is the total number of
trades for stock i during the period under study.

Previously, Ref.

[22] used 30 stocks from the TAQ
database for the period 1993 − 1996 and proposed that
HT has the universal value 0.94 ± 0.05.

For short time windows (#), all signals are nearly uncorre-

ﬁtted slopes are γNY SE(∆t < 20min) = 0.001 ± 0.002, and
γNASDAQ(∆t < 2min) = 0.003 ± 0.002. For larger time win-
dows ((cid:4)), the strength of correlations depends logarithmi-
cally on the mean trading activity of the stock, γNY SE(∆t >

where the series is not deﬁned in time, but instead on a

The data show a crossover, similar to that for the
traded value f , from a lower to a higher value of HT (i)
when the window size is approximately the daily mean
number of trades (for an example, see the inset of Fig.
3). For the restricted set studied in Ref. [22], the value
HT ≈ 0.94 ± 0.05 was suggested for window sizes above
the crossover.

Similarly to the case of traded value Hurst ex-
ponents analyzed in Section III,
the inclusion of
more stocks[29] reveals the underlying systematic non-
universality. Again,
less frequently traded stocks ap-
pear to have weaker autocorrelations as HT decreases
monotonously with growing hT i. One can ﬁt an approx-
imate logarithmic law [30],[31] to characterize the trend:

HT = H ∗

T + γT log hT i ,

(7)

where γT = −0.10 ± 0.02 for the period 1994 − 1995 (see
Fig. 3) and γT = −0.08 ± 0.02 for the year 2000 [27].

In their recent preprint, Yuen and Ivanov [23] indepen-
dently show a tendency similar to Eq. (7) for intertrade
times of NYSE and NASDAQ in a diﬀerent set of stocks.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have summarized a few recent ad-
vances in understanding the role of company size in trad-
ing dynamics. We revisited a number of previous studies
of stock market data and found that the extension of the
range of capitalization of the studied ﬁrms reveals a new
aspect of stylized facts: The characteristics of trading
display a fundamental dependence on capitalization.

We have shown that trading activity hf i, the number
of trades per minute hN i and the mean size of transac-
tions hV i display non-trivial, monotonous dependence on
company capitalization, which cannot be described by a
simple power law. On the other hand, for moderate to
large companies, a power law gives an acceptable ﬁt for
the dependence of the mean transaction size on the trad-
ing frequency.

The Hurst exponents for the variance of traded
value/intertrade times can be deﬁned and they depend
logarithmically on the mean trading activity hf i/mean
intertrade time hT i.

5

These ﬁndings imply that special care must be taken
when the concepts of scaling and universality are applied
to ﬁnancial processes. For the modeling of stock market
processes, one should always consider that many charac-
teristic quantities depend strongly on the capitalization.
The introduction of such models seems a real challenge
at present.

[28] Note that many minor stocks do not represent actual
companies, only diﬀerent class stocks of a larger ﬁrm.
[29] For a reliable calculation of Hurst exponents, we had
to discard those stocks that had less than hN i < 10−3
trades/min for 1994−1995 and hN i < 2·10−3 trades/min
for 2000. This ﬁltering leaves 3519 and 3775 stocks, re-
spectively.

[30] As intertrade intervals are closely related to the number
of trades per minute N (t), it is not surprising to ﬁnd the
similar tendency for that quantity [26].

[31] Note that for window sizes smaller than the daily mean
number of trades, intertrade times are only weakly cor-
related and the Hurst exponent is nearly independent of
hT i. This is analogous to what was seen for traded value
records in Sec. III.

There is more and more empirical evidence that multifractality consti-
tutes another and perhaps the most signiﬁcant ﬁnancial stylized fact. A
realistic model of the ﬁnancial dynamics should therefore incorporate this
eﬀect. The most promising in this respect is the Multifractal Model of
Asset Returns (MMAR) introduced by Mandelbrot et al. [1] in which mul-
tifractality is carried by time deformation. In our study we focus on the
Lux extension to MMAR and empirical data from Warsaw Stock Exchange.
We show that this model is able to reproduce relevant aspects of the real
stock market dynamics.

1. Introduction

Empirical data collected from the stock market has extremely compli-
cated structure. Apparently, it can seem to be white noise without correla-
tions and with complete disorder, but, by investigating it deeper by means
of sophisticated methods, one discovers important non-random features and
an amazing hierarchy. Amongst these key properties (the so-called stylized
facts) are the fat tails of p.d.f. of the logarithmic returns, the long range
correlations in volatility, the leverage eﬀect and some nontrivial fractal char-
acteristics of data [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Especially the fractal aspects seem to
be particularly important due to their ability to describe complex systems
in a relatively simple way. Scaling properties, which are fundamental in the
fractal formalism, manifest themselves as a linear plot of a given quantity on
a log-log scale and the systems exhibiting such behaviour are called scale-
free. As many real-world signals, the ﬁnancial data cannot be described as
a single fractal object but rather as a structure comprising a whole fam-
ily of interwoven fractals forming a multifractal. Thus, description of this

(1)

2

kind of data requires idetifying all of its fractal components. The multi-
fractal formalism was originally proposed in ref. [8] where the singularity
spectrum f (α) was introduced as a tool characterizing a multifractal. This
formalism allowed researchers to discover multifractality in almost all ﬁelds
of science and has gradually become a powerful method quantifying time
series coming from biology, physics, economics, technical science and many
others [9, 10, 11].

Having identiﬁed the fractal properties of data, the next natural step of
the analysis is to simulate a process capable of reproducing these properties
under control. As regards the ﬁnancial world, the two following models have
been proposed. The Mandelbrot’s Multifractal Model of Assets Returns
(MMAR) [1, 12, 13] approximates evolution of the returns with a compound
process involving multifractal time and a monofractal fractional Brownian
motion. In contrast, the Multifractal Random Walk (MRW) [14, 15] can
be viewed as a continuous interpolation of a discrete multifractal cascade.
What is particularly important in this context is that multifractal features
are not reproduced in such popular models like the family of ARCH pro-
cesses.

In our paper we refer only to MMAR model and, more speciﬁcally, to
one of its extensions that we shall call the Lux model [16]. Unlike the static
original MMAR model, it incorporates an iterative mechanism that mimics
eﬀects of the generating cascade for each consecutive point without limiting
the length of a signal. An advantage of this innovation, that looks attractive
especially from the perspective of ﬁnancial engineering, is its forecasting
power [17]. We show ﬂexibility of the Lux model while an analyzed process
changes dynamics. Inspecting the evolution of the model’s parameters can
help us interpreting the multifractal properties of empirical data.

Let us denote the increments of a stationary process X(t) by [1]

2. Multifractal formalism

X(t, ∆t) = X(t + ∆t) − X(t).

Multifractality of this process can be deﬁned by a non-uniform scaling of
the q-order correlation function X(t, ∆t)

E[X(t, ∆t)q] ∼ ∆tτ (q)+1,

where τ (q) denotes the scaling exponent. If τ (q) nonlinearly depends on q
we say that X(t, ∆t) possesses a multifractal character. In a case of linear
behaviour of τ (q) such a process is called monofractal. An example of the

(1)

(2)

3

(3)

(4)

monofractal dynamics is fractional Brownian motion which has no correla-
tion (its classic version) or is only linearly correlated. τ (q) can be related to
the singularity spectrum f (α) by applying the Legendre transformation [18]

q = df /dα
τ (q) = qα − f (α) .

(cid:26)

For the Brownian motion the singularity spectrum consists of a single point
localized at α = H and f (α) = 1, indicating a strong linear correlation
(positive one for H > 0.5 and negative one for H < 0.5) or no correlation
(H = 0.5). For a signal with a multifractal structure the f (α) shape resem-
bles an inverted parabola. The strength of multifractality can be quantiﬁed
in terms of the f (α) curve width

∆α = αmax − αmin.

The bigger ∆α the richer multifractal (we can also say the more “convo-
luted” fractals). Multifractality of a signal can be detected by using one
of the modern methods like Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis
(MFDFA) [19] or Wavelet Transform Modulus Maxima (WTMM) [18]. Here
we restrict the analysis to MFDFA which in our opinion gives more reliable
results [20].

3. Nonlinear dynamics of WIG20

Recent studies show that ﬂuctuation distribution of a market index can-
not be well approximated by a Gaussian [2]. Probability density function
of the returns is characterized by the so-called fat tails which in most cases
obey an inverse cubic power law if expressed as c.d.f. [21]. However, in the
case of an emerging market we cannot a priori exclude a diﬀerent behaviour.
In the beginning of our study we ﬁrst verify if the stock price ﬂuctuations
on the Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE) obey the same law as larger devel-
oped markets. Calculations were carried out on high frequency data of the
WSE blue chips WIG20 index sampled with 1 minute resolution over the
period 1999-2004. All the overnight returns were removed as they are con-
taminated by some spurious artiﬁcial eﬀects. The WIG20 ﬂuctuations are
shown in Figure 1. What we can easily notice is that after the end of April
2002 the wildest ﬂuctuations seem to be suppressed and the signal becomes
“milder”. Thus, it is natural to divide our signal into the two following
periods and consider them separately: the ﬁrst one from January 1999 to
April 2002 (237304 points) and the second one from May 2002 to Decem-
ber 2004 (237268 points). Cumulative distributions for both time series are
presented in Figure 2. In average they remain consistent with the inverse

4

power cubic law. For the ﬁrst period we actually have α = 2.8 but only for
a very narrow range of plot, while for the second period a larger deviation
is visible (α = 4.2). Consistently with the above conclusion from Figure
1, we see a diﬀerence in scaling properties between the periods. From a
potential investor’s point of view, an even more important information is
stored in temporal correlations of the analyzed signal. This information can
be derived from its multifractal properties that can be a result of both the
wide ﬂuctuations distribution and the correlations in higher moments. It
is instructive to calculate the f (α) spectra for each year individually and
to identify changes in the signal evolution. The corresponding spectra are
shown in Figure 3. The most interesting feature of this Figure is that the
f (α) maxima systematically shift towards lower α’s: from α = 0.61 in 1999
to α = 0.48 in 2004), with the exception of 2000 (dashed line), suggesting
a gradual transition from a strong persistence (1999) to a weak antiper-
sistence (2004). Almost all the spectra are wide (∆α > 0.2) and can be
interpreted as a manifestation of strong multifractality and rich dynamics.
The narrowest curve is for 2004 (∆α = 0.11) so we can regard it as the least
interesting one from the multifractal point of view.

4. Multifractactal Model of Asset Returns

According to MMAR the logarithmic price P (t) is assumed to follow a
compound process consisting of a fractional Brownian motion BH(t) and a
time time θ(t):

P (t) = BH(θ(t)).

(5)

Here BH represents a monofractal process which is a sum of random vari-
ables sampled by c.d.f. of a multifractal measure. Both BH and θ(t) are
independent. A crucial role in the considered process plays the virtual trad-
ing time which can be interpreted as a deformation of the homogeneous
clock-time or as a local volatility corresponding to faster or slower trad-
ing. The linear correlation of P (t) depends on the Hurst exponent H fully
characterizing the Brownian motion, whereas the multifractal properties are
generated by a multiplicative cascade. It has to be noted that in the origi-
nal formalism of ref. [1] the whole cascade is generated globally at the same
moment for each level k. However, for the sake of prediction we need an
iterative procedure that is able to diﬀerentiate past and future events. This
is the rationale behind the application of a multiplicative measure proposed
by Lux [16].

where i = 1, ..., k. The upper option is taken either with the probability
2−(k−i) or if for any preceding i this option has already been chosen. Oth-
erwise the multiplier remains the same as for previous t. We can imitate in
this way the structure of a binary cascade and, on average, preserve its es-
sential features. Based on this construction we see that in order to describe
the multifractal properties of such a cascade we need only one parameter λ.
Theoretical multifractal spectrum is then given by

f (α) = 1 − (α − λ)2

This formula implies that f (α) is symmetric and has a maximum localized at

of local volatility and white noise [16]

We try to mimic evolution of WIG20 based on the Lux extension to
MMAR and observe how the changes in WIG20 dynamics inﬂuence the
parameter λ of the model. This gives us information about the model ﬂex-
ibility and its ability to simulate a highly nonstationary process like the
WIG20 returns. Since ﬁtting the model with a log-normal multiplier distri-
bution requires to estimate only the parameter λ deﬁning the distribution
of Eq. (7), it can be derived by using the relation [12]

fP (α) = fθ(α/H)

(10)

and Eq. (8). First we consider the simplest case of H = 0.5. The singularity
spectrum can be estimated by means of MFDFA with polynomial order 2 [7].
Figure 2 shows c.d.f. of a time series generated according to the Lux model
(dash-dotted line). This distribution has a somewhat thinner tail than the
inverse cubic power law, but it is similar to c.d.f.
for WIG20 from the
period 2002/05−2004/12. In this case the model appropriately reconstructs
the dynamics including large ﬂuctuations.

The evolution of λ is analyzed by using a moving window of length
20000 data points shifted by 2000 points. Such a window ensures that we
obtain statistically reliable results. From Figure 4 we see that λ strongly
ﬂuctuates over the analyzed period. Nevertheless, starting from the end of
2001 it forms a clearly decreasing trend. The smallest values of λ correspond
to 2004 and even drop below 1. In the multifractal formalism λ refers to
the structure complexity; the larger λ the more complicated signal and more
complex fractal. It stems from this that from 2002 to 2004 the complexity of
the Polish stock market gradually decreased despite the existence of some
bigger ﬂuctuations. This result remains in a perfect agreement with the
indications of the f (α) spectra (Figure 3).

Although ﬁxing H value at 0.5 can give approximate results for shorter
signals (e.g. of length of the window applied before), in general it is recom-
mended to treat H as a free parameter which has to be estimated from the
data because it may inﬂuence the forecasted volatility [22]. To accomplish

this task we have to use the relation between f (α) spectra for the price and
the time processes (Eq. (10)) together with the following condition [13]:

τP (1/H) = 0.

(11)

where τP stands for the scaling exponent of the price process. The so-
estimated Hurst exponent H can be used in the calculation of λ. Results
for the windowed WIG20 are collected in Figure 5. For the ﬁrst three-year-
long interval the Hurst exponent indicate persistent behaviour of the index,
while starting from 2002 the value of H almost monotonically decreases
below 0.5 suggesting a transition to the antipersistent regime. Again, this
resembles the conclusion made from Figure 3 but now the evidence is even
more convincing. As regards λ, we see that now its ﬂuctuations are smaller
and there is no clear decreasing trend. Therefore, in the present case of
variable H this quantity absorbs the information about changes in WIG20
dynamics.

6. Conclusions

The study presented in this paper reveals several interesting facts about
dynamics of the Polish stock market. First, we see that the WIG20 ﬂuctu-
ation magnitude changes in the ﬁrst half of year 2002. This suppression of
the largest ﬂuctuations is also visible in c.d.f. of the log-returns. Moreover,

we identify this nonstationarity of WIG20 in evolution of the parameter λ
of the Lux model. These observations indicates that this model is able to
reproduce at least some of the ﬁnancial data characteristics and to help one
with detecting evolution phases with diﬀerent properties. In the last step
we include in our analysis the empirical estimation of the Hurst exponent,
a parameter which is necessary for the forecasting purpose. As our results
document, value of this parameter largely determines the multifractal prop-
erties of the WIG20 evolution, leaving λ only as an auxilliary measure.

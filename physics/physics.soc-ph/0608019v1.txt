Abstract.
We present several models to describe the stochastic evolution of stocks that show some strong re-
sistance at some level and generalize to this situation the evolution based upon geometric Brownian
motion. If volatility and drift are related in a certain way we show that our model can be integrated
in an exact way. The related problem of how to prize general securities that pay dividends at a
continuous rate and earn a terminal payoﬀ at maturity T is solved.

Introduction

We consider an ideal model of ﬁnancial market consisting of two securities: a savings account Zt
evolving via dZt = rtZtdt, where rt is the instantaneous interest rate of the market and is assumed to
be deterministic (but not necessarily constant); and a ”risky” asset whose price at time t: Xt, evolves
according to some stochastic diﬀerential eq. (SDE) driven by Brownian motion (BM). As it is well
known, the prototype model for stocks-price evolution assumes that the return process Rt = log Xt
follows a random walk or BM with drift and hence that prices Xt evolve via by the popular geometric
Brownian motion (GBM) model, i.e., that Xt satisﬁes

dXt = µXtdt + σXtdWt

Here µ is the mean return rate and σ the volatility which are supposed to be constants while Wt is a
Brownian motion under the empirical or real world probability. We remark that here and elsewhere in
this article integrals and SDE’s are understood in the sense of Itˆo’s calculus. Transition to standard
(Stratonovitch) calculus can be done if wished.
The solution to this SDE is given by

After the seminal work of Black and Scholes [1] and Merton [2], who derive a formula to price options
on stocks with underlying dynamics based upon GMB, eq. (1) has become the paradigmatic model

1

to describe both price evolution and derivatives pricing. However, while such a simple model captures
well the basic features of prices it does not quite account for more stylized facts that empirical prices
show; among them we mention the appearance of ”heavy tails” for long values of the relevant density
probability distributions of returns [3,4]; further, the empirical distribution shows an exponential form
for moderate values of the returns, which is not quite ﬁtted by the predicted log-normal density implied
by (2). The existence of self-scaling and long memory eﬀects was ﬁrst noticed in [5]. Due to all this
option pricing under this GBM framework can not fully account for the observed market option prices
and the classical Black-Scholes & Merton (BSM) formula is found to overprice (respectively downprice)
”in (respectively, out of) the money options”. Apparently, for empirical prices of call options to ﬁt
this formula an extra dependence in the strike price, the volatility smile, must be introduced by hand.
After the seminal paper by Mantegna and Stanley who studied the empirical evolution of the stock
index S&P500 of the American Stock Exchange during a ﬁve year period, several authors have elabo-
rated on the possibility that prices dynamics involves Levy process and have discussed option pricing
in such a framework (See [5-13]). For complete accounts of option pricing and stochastic calculus from
the economist and, respectively, physicist, points of view see [14-16] and [17-21].

Here we shall focus in another diﬀerent aspect that some traded stocks seem to present, viz the
possibility of having, at some level, strong resistances both from above or below. For example,
corporations or major institutions may have laid out a policy under which heavy buy orders are
triggered whenever the stock price hits this level. Such feature can not be described with Eq. (1) as
under such an evolution prices can reach any value in (0,
). Concretely, in this paper we want to
model the evolution of a market stock which has a strong lower resistance at some level c where we
suppose that c is a constant.

∞

In section (2) we present a model that incorporates an attainable barrier at the point x = c > 0 and
hence can, in principle, be used to account for such a fact. We next derive the evolution of the asset
and the probability distribution function. It turns out that c is a regular barrier in terms of Feller’s
boundary theory and hence a prescription on how to proceed once reached must be given. In section
(3) we study pricing of securities under such a model and obtain a closed formula for valuation of
European derivatives that have, in addition, a continuous stream of payments. We tackle this problem
using the Martingale formalism of Harrison et al [22] and obtain the partial diﬀerential equation (PDE)
that the price of a security satisﬁes. Solving this eq. corresponding to particular ﬁnal conditions we
obtain the price of options under this model. This price is compared with that given by the standard
Black& Scholes- Merton formula. In the appendix we consider some technical issues concerning value
of the market price of risk and the the existence of the martingale measure or risk free possibility
under which securities are priced.

2 Price evolution under the martingale probability

t
Let rt be the deterministic interest rate at time t and Zt = exp
0 rsds be a ”savings account ”. As we

pointed out we consider that Xt is the t-price of a tradeable asset that has a strong lower resistance
X0. Mathematically this implies that the values of
at some constant level c where 0 < c < x0 ≡

) and hence Xt must have a boundary point of a certain
Xt must be restricted to the interval [c,
kind at x = c. From intuitive ﬁnancial arguments the boundary can not be of absorbing type since in
that case, once reached, the price Xt remains there. Further it seems reasonable to assume that there
exists positive probability to attain the boundary; we suppose that this event ”triggers” bid orders
and hence that Xt ricochets upon hitting the boundary. Therefore in such situation the assumption
that prices evolve via Eq. (1) is no longer valid. The obvious modiﬁcation wherein prices evolve as

(cid:16)

is also ruled out as this evolution implies that c < Xt <
but the value Xt = c is never attained and
the probability to get arbitrarily close to the barrier tends to zero with the distance to it (In terms of
Feller’s theory brieﬂy reminded below x = c is a natural barrier at which Feller functions blow up).

∞

Motivated by similar ideas in the context of the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross model of interest rate dynamics
[23] we now introduce a more satisfactory model which satisﬁes the aforementioned features and is at
the same time analytically tractable; we shall suppose that Xt evolves via the SDE

where x0 > c, µ is the stock mean rate of return and the volatility coeﬃcient b(t, x) is given by

dXt = µXtdt + b(t, Xt)dWt, X0 = x0

b(t, x) = σ(t)

x2

c2

−

p

Indeed, under such a dynamics it follows from (4) that as x approaches the point c, b(t, x) tends to
zero and hence Xt evolves roughly like dXt = µXtdt implying that Xt will increase and then escape
from the boundary.
For valuation purposes one needs to consider the evolution under a new probability that might be
diﬀerent to the empirical observed probability. Mathematically speaking a such a probability is deﬁned
Xt/Zt are martingales (this risk-neutral probability
requiring that under it the discounted prices X ′t ≡
was introduced in [22] although the underlying idea pervades the original work of Black-Scholes &
Merton [1,2]). Stated another way, this means that under the risk-neutral probability , the stock price
Xt evolves, on average, as the riskless security Zt thereby preventing arbitrage opportunities. Indeed,
the martingale property implies

needed to go back to the empirical or real world probabilities. Indeed, it follows from these arguments
that consideration of this probability amounts to redeﬁning the evolution equation without changing
the volatility coeﬃcient b(t, x) but replacing the drift coeﬃcient to ˆa(t, x) = rtx, independent of the
initial coeﬃcient a(t, x)
Unfortunately, in general it is not possible to solve the SDE (3) corresponding to the diﬀusion coef-
ﬁcients (4) with ˆa(t, x) = rtx. However, it turns out that in the particular case when σ2(t) = 2r(t)
then both the SDE (3) and the prizing problem can be solved as we next show. We shall consider this
case and hence we suppose that under the risk neutral probability P∗, Xt evolves via the SDE

However, the existence and nature of all objects introduced below is a technically diﬃcult point. In
the appendix we sketch how to perform such a construction.
In the sequel all quantities are referred to the probability P∗ and hence Xt evolves via (8). Further

Thus only when Rt is close to 0 it does behave like a classical random walk.
Useful information about the behavior of the process at x = c follows by careful inspection of the
nature of the boundary x = c. Consider the Feller functions Σ(c, x), Ω(c, x) deﬁned by

exited from in ﬁnite time with positive probability.
While Feller analysis shows that the boundary is attainable it does not clarify if the process can
be continued past the boundary (and hence whether prices below the level x = c can be attained).
Further it it is unclear what is the probability to reach the boundary or how the to continue the
process upon hitting the boundary.
These kind of problems regarding behavior of the process at and past the boundary are generically
quite diﬃcult to tackle. For this particular model the behavior of the process is completely determined.
Actually we have found that the solution to eq. (8) is given in a fully explicit way by

Here u(t, s) is the so called market price of risk . There exist technical diﬃculties due to the singularity
of u at x = c which might prevent, in principle, for Mt to be a Martingale. Skipping them one may
expect this to be the case. Then deﬁning the risk neutral probability P∗ by dP∗ = MT dP it follows
0 u(s, X s)ds is a BM under P. In this case
from Girsanov’s theorem (see [17,20]) that W ∗t ≡
R
an easy calculation shows that Xt satisﬁes (8).

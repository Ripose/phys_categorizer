We model information traﬃc on scale-free networks by introducing the bandwidth as the delivering
ability of links. We focus on the eﬀects of bandwidth on the packet delivering ability of the traﬃc
system to better understand traﬃc dynamic in real network systems. Such ability can be measured
by a phase transition from free ﬂow to congestion. Two cases of node capacity C are considered,
i.e., C = constant and C is proportional to the node’s degree. We ﬁgured out the decrease of the
handling ability of the system together with the movement of the optimal local routing coeﬃcient
αc, induced by the restriction of bandwidth. Interestingly, for low bandwidth, the same optimal
value of αc emerges for both cases of node capacity. We investigate the number of packets of each
node in the free ﬂow state and provide analytical explanations for the optimal value of αc. Average
packets traveling time is also studied. Our study may be useful for evaluating the overall eﬃciency
of networked traﬃc systems, and for allevating traﬃc jam in such systems.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Since the pioneering work of Watts and Strogatz [1],
and Barab´asi and Albert [2], complex networks theory
have attracted growing interest among physics commu-
nity. Complex networks can describe many natural, so-
cial and technical systems in which lots of entities or peo-
ple are connected by physical links or some abstract re-
lations [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Due to the importance of large
communication networks such as the Internet, WWW,
power grid and transportation systems with scale-free
properties in modern society, the traﬃc of information
ﬂow have drawn more and more attention. Ensuring free
traﬃc ﬂow on these networks is of great signiﬁcance and
research interest [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,
21, 22, 23, 24].

As pointed out by Newman, the ultimate goal of study-
ing complex networks is to understand how the network
eﬀects inﬂuence many kinds of dynamical processes tak-
ing place upon networks [5]. Recent works have proposed
some models to mimic the traﬃc on complex networks by
introducing packets generating rate and the routing of
packets [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. These kind of models
can deﬁne the capacity of networks by the critical gen-
erating rate at which a phase transition from free ﬂow
state to congested state occurs. The free ﬂow state cor-
responds to the number of created and delivered packet
are balanced, and the jammed state corresponds to the
packets accumulate on the network.

Many recent studies have focused on two aspects to
control the congestion and improve the eﬃciency of trans-

portation: modifying underlying network structures or
developing better route searching strategies in a large
network [25]. Due to the high cost of changing the infras-
tructure, the latter is comparatively preferable. In this
light, some models have been proposed to forward pack-
ets following the shortest path [18], the eﬃcient path [19],
the nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neightbor search-
ing strategy [20, 21, 22], the local static information [20],
or the integration of local static and dynamic informa-
tion [21]. In view of the diﬃculty of knowing the whole
topology of many large and rapidly growing communi-
cation systems, the local routing strategy attracts more
attention because the local static topology information
can be easily acquired and stored in each router.

However, previous studies usually neglect the band-
width of the links, i.e., the maximum capacity of each
link for delivering packets. Obviously, in real systems,
the capability of links are limited and variates from link
to link and in most cases, these restrictions could be very
important in triggering congestion in the traﬃc system.
Therefore, since the analysis on the eﬀects of the link
bandwidth restrictions on traﬃc eﬃciency is still missing,
we study the traﬃc dynamics in which the bandwidth is
taken into account, based on the local routing strategy.
The paper is organized as follows. In section II, the
traﬃc model is introduced. In section III, the simulation
results are presented and discussed. The summary is
given in section IV.

II. THE TRAFFIC MODEL

To generate the underlying traﬃc network, our simula-
tion starts with the most general Barab´asi-Albert scale-
free network model which is in good accordance with real
observations of communication networks [3]. Driven by

the growth and preferential attachment mechanisms, it
can generate power-law degree distribution P (k) ∼ k−γ,
where γ = 3. In this model, starting from m0 fully con-
nected nodes, a new node with m links is added to the
existing graph at each time step according to the prefer-
ential attachment, i.e., the probability Πi of being con-
nected to the existing node i is proportional to the degree
ki of the node, Πi = ki
, where the sum runs over all
Σj kj
existing nodes.

Then we model the traﬃc of packets on the given net-
work. We treat all nodes as both hosts and routers for
generating and delivering packets and assume that each
node can deliver at most C packets per step towards their
destinations. The capacity of each link is restricted by
Bandwidth(B), i.e., each link can handle at most B pack-
ets from each end per time step. Motivated by the pre-
vious local routing models [20, 21], the system evolves in
parallel according to the following rules:

1. Add New Packets - Packets are added with a given
rate R (number of packets per time step) at randomly
selected nodes and each packet is given a random desti-
nation.

2. Deliver Packets - Each node performs a local search
among its neighbors. If a packet’s destination is found
in its nearest neighborhood, it will be delivered directly
to its target and then removed from the system. Other-
wise, its will be delivered to a neighboring node n with
preferential probability:

Pn =

kα
n
Σikα
i

,

(1)

where the sum runs over the neighboring nodes, and α
is a tunable parameter. FIFO (ﬁrst-in-ﬁrst-out) queuing
discipline is applied at each node.

In the simulation, we investigate the network perfor-
mance with node capacity C = 10 or C = k correpond-
ing to the degree of the node, and with link bandwidth
B = 5, 3, 1 and 1 ≤ B ≤ 5 for each case.

To characterize the system’s overall capacity, we inves-

tigate the order parameter:

η(R) = lim
t→∞

h∆Npi
R∆t

,

(2)

where Np(t) is the number of packets on the network at
time t. ∆Np = Np(t+∆t)−Np(t) with h...i takes average
over time windows of width ∆t. Obviously, η(R) = 0 cor-
responds to the cases of free ﬂow state where the balance
between added and removed packets can be achieved. As
R increases, there is a critical Rc at which η suddenly in-
crease from zero to nonzero, which indicates the phase
transiton from free ﬂow to congestion that the packets
begin to accumulate on the network. Hence, the sys-
tem’s capacity can be measured by the value of Rc below
which the system can maintain its eﬃcient functioning.

realizations.

III. SIMULATION RESULTS AND
DISCUSSIONS

In the special case of C = 10 and B ≥ 10, the max-
imum network capacity is Rc ≈ 40, which is achieved
at the optimal value αc = −1.0 [20]. This can be ex-
plained as the average number of packets on nodes does
not depend on degree k at αc = −1.0 and thus leads to
a fact that no congestion occurs earlier on some nodes
with particular degree than on others .

Then we study the eﬀect of bandwidth on the network
capacity in the case of ﬁxed node capacity C = 10 with
constant bandwidth B = 5, 3, 1 for each link or B is a
random integer selected in the range from 1 to 5 for the
links. The constant B case corresponds to a uniform
bandwidth system, and the random B case corresponds
to a system with diﬀerent bandwidth for each link. Fig.1
compares the network capacity Rc for the cases. One can
see that at a given α, the network capacity decreases with
small B value. This is easy to be understood because the
bandwidth prohibit the free ﬂow of packets from one node
to the other node thus decreases the network capacity.

Furthermore, the optimal value of αc corresponding to
the maximum capacity increases from −1.0 to −0.95 for
B = 5, −0.8 for B = 3, and −0.5 for both B = 1 and
1 ≤ B ≤ 5. This can be explained as follows. Let ni(t)
denotes the number of packets of node i at time t. In
the case of homogeneously generated sources and desti-
nations for the packets, the number of packets generated
and removed at node i are balanced. Considering the
contribution of received and delivered packets of node i
to the change of ni(t), the evolution of ni(t) in the free

where nout denotes the number of packet delivered from
node i to its neighbouring nodes, and nin denotes the
number of received packets. From Eq.3, in the case of
B ≥ C, Wang et al. show that n(k) ∼ k1+α [20]. There-
fore, when α = −1.0, the average number of packets
on nodes is independent of degree k and thus there will
not be some nodes that are more easy to jam, so that
the maximum network capacity is achieved. However,
α > −1.0 means that there are more packets on the hub
nodes (with greater degree k). Considering the restric-
tion of B < C, since the hub nodes have more links thus
have more total bandwidth, α > −1.0 is better to fully
use the bandwidth of the hub nodes and thus enhance
the system’s capacity.

To better understand why α > −1.0 is the optimal
choise, we investigate the number of received packets of
node i

therefore we can get

where W is a constant. In order to keep in the free ﬂow
state, one can easily conclude from Eq.3 that nout ≥ nin
should be satisﬁed. For high-degree nodes, nout is mainly
constrained by two limits: nout ≈ Bki and nout ≈ C.
Considering nout ≈ Bki, and inserting Eq.5 into Eq.4,
we can get

Bki ≥

Since C is a constant, higher degree nodes are more
easily congested than those low degree nodes. We con-
sider the case that i is a high degree node, for BA scale-
free network, most of neighbors of i are low degree nodes.
For small B, nout of low degree nodes are mostly re-
stricted by the bandwidth. Hence, we assume a linear
relationship for low-degree nodes as

nj = Bkj

(7)

In the limit of very large network, N → ∞, ki → ∞
and thus the right hand side of Eq.8 approaches zero, and
so that the optimal α should be smaller than zero.

Considering nout ≈ C, we can get

Inserting Eq.7 to Eq.9, we obtain

C ≥

For low-degree nodes, nout is mainly constrained by
Bki, i.e., nout ≈ Bki. And for BA scale-free network,
most of neighbors of low-degree nodes are high-degree
nodes, for which we can take nj ≈ C. Thus we can get

. To continue, we
use Eq.10, which is the minimum of Eq.8,10 and 12. One
can see from Eq.10 that the optimal α should locate be-
tween −1.0 and 0.0, and that when B decrease from inﬁn-
ity to 1, αc will be more close to zero. For our simulation
parameters, we can get W ≈ 0.4 when α = −0.5 (Eq.5)
and kmax ≈ 100, thus αc ≤ −0.7 for the case of B = 1.
It is quite close to our simulation result (see Fig.1).

Then we simulate the packets’ average traveling time

hT i against R with diﬀerent α. One can see for −1.0 ≤
α ≤ 0.0, hT i remain as a relatively small value when
R ≤ Rc(α). When R increases beyond Rc, hT i will in-
crease very rapidly, implying that the system is jammed.
When α = −0.5, the optimal average traveling time is
obtained, whereas hT i increase much more rapidly when
α deviates from −0.5. Thus αc = −0.5 is the best choice.
This is consistent with the above analysis that a maxi-
mum Rc occurs when αc = −0.5.

In the second part, we investigate the eﬀect of band-
width on the network capacity considering the existence
of diﬀerent handling or delivering ability of nodes, i.e., in

timal value of local routing parameter αc changes to 0.0
while the maximum network capacity remains as Rc ≈ 40
In the case of
[20]. This can be explained as follows.
B ≥ kmax and α = 0.0, packets perform random-like
walks on the network. A well-known result in the ran-
dom walk process valid for this case is that the time the
packet spends at a given node is proportional to the de-
gree of such node in the limit of long times [26]. One
can easily conclude that, in the traﬃc system with many
packets, the number of packets on a given node averaging
over a period of time is proportional to the degree of that
node, i.e., ni ∼ ki. At the same time, the node deliver-
ing ability C is proportional to its degree, i.e., Ci ∼ ki,
so that the load and delivering ability of each node are
balanced, which leads to a fact that no congestion oc-
curs earlier on some nodes with particular degree than
on others. Considering that in the traﬃc model, an oc-
currence of congestion at any node will diﬀuse to the
entire network, no more easily congested nodes brings
the maximum network capacity, so that routing packets
with α = 0.0 can induce the maximum capacity of the
system.

Fig.3 depicts the network capacity Rc against α in the
case of C = k with diﬀerent values of B. One can see that
the network capacity becomes smaller with B decreasing,
and the optimal value of αc also decreases from αc = 0.0
for B = 5 to αc = −0.1 for B = 3, αc = −0.3 for 1 ≤ B ≤
5, and αc = −0.5 for B = 1. The reason of capacity drop
is the same as in the case of C = 10, i.e., the bandwidth
of the link prohibit the delivery process thus aﬀect the
network’s overall capacity. The decrease of αc is diﬀerent
from the case of C = 10 and can be explained as follows.
As mensioned before, αc = 0.0 corresponds to ni(k) ∼ ki
and αc < 0.0 means redistributing traﬃc load in hub
nodes to other noncentral nodes. Considering the free
ﬂow condition of nout ≥ nin with the limitation of nout ≈
C = k, following a similar analysis, one can get

parameter is N = 1000, m0 = m = 3.

the case of C is not a constant but propotional to the de-
gree of each node C = k. This may be used to descibe the
fact that if a router is very important and bears heavy
traﬃc, its delivering ability may be enhanced to avoid
congestion.

In the special case of B ≥ kmax corresponding to the
maximum degree of the nodes in the network, the main
diﬀerence from the case of B ≥ C = 10 is that the op-

In both cases, one can conclude that the optimal α
should be close to zero. But when α = 0.0, ni ∼ ki and
the nodes perform random selection among all its links to
send packets. In the long run of t → ∞, one can ﬁnd that
the number of packets forwarding towards each link in
each time step should follow a Poisson distribution with
mean value λ = 1. Thus the hub nodes are more easily
jammed when α = 0.0 that some packets will be prohibit
by the bandwidth of the links. Though the ideal condi-
tion is sending one packet per link in each time step, the
bandwidth of the link should be more than 1 to maintain
free ﬂow, i.e., B = 1 + δ where δ representing spanning
of the Poisson distribution. Therefore, when B is smaller

than 1 + δ, the optimal αc should be smaller than zero to
redistribute taﬃc load to other noncentral nodes in order
to avoid congestion in hub nodes. In Fig.3, one can see
that when B = 5, αc remains as zero, whereas when B
decrease to less than 5, αc will decrease from zero.

This result is in agreement with the result of Yan et
al.[19] and Wang et al.[21] that redistributing traﬃc load
to the noncentral nodes can enhance the system’s overall
capacity. The αc smaller than zero can make the large
degree nodes fully used, and also allow packets to bypass
those nodes when they aﬀord heavy traﬃc burden. Thus
the system’s maximum eﬃciency is achieved. Another
interesting phenomenon emerges in the case of very low
bandwidth is that the same optimal value of αc = −0.5
and Rc ≈ 8 is obtained when B = 1 in both cases of
node capacity we considered in this paper, i.e., C = 10
and C = k. This simply show that the system’s capacity
is mainly controlled by the bandwidth of the links and the
nodes’ capacity do not aﬀect the overall eﬃciency when
bandwidth B is very low. That is, when the link band-

5

width is low, it is useless to enhance the routers’ ability
only and traﬃc congestion would be triggered mainly by
the links.

Fig.4 shows the average travel time hT i against R with
diﬀerent α when Ci = ki. The results are also in agree-
ment with the above analysis that αc = −0.5 can lead to
better eﬃciency of the network.

 

IV. SUMMARY

In conclusion, we investigate the eﬀects of link band-
width on the traﬃc capability in scale-free network base
on the local routing strategy. In general, the capacity de-
creases when the link bandwidth is considered, whether
the node capacity is set as a constant or proportional
to the degree of the nodes. Moreover, the optimal value
of local routing paramter αc also depends on the band-
width of the links. In the case of constant node capacity
C = 10, αc increases from −1.0 to −0.5 when B de-
creases from inﬁnity to 1, while in the case of C = k, αc
decreases from 0.0 to −0.5 when B decreases. And we
found that the node capacity can not enhance the sys-
tem eﬃciency when B is very low. We give analytical
explanations for the above phenomena, and the analyti-
cal results are in agreement with the simulation results.
Moreover, we study the average traveling time of packets,
which also exhibit similar phase transition behavior and
is optimized when α is tuned to between −1.0 and zero.
Our study may be useful for evaluating the overall eﬃ-
ciency of networked traﬃc systems. Moreover, this model
can be applied to other networks and may also shed some
light on alleviating the congestion of modern technologi-
cal networks.

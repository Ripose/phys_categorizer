The collaboration network is an example of a social network which has both non-trivial temporal
and spatial dependence. Based on the observations of collaborations in Physical Review Letters,
a model of collaboration network is proposed which correctly reproduces the time evolution of the
link length distributions, clustering coeﬃcients, degree distributions and assortative property of real
data to a large extent.

INTRODUCTION

Ever since the discovery of small world eﬀect in a vari-
ety of networks [1], study of real world networks and their
theoretical modelling have generated tremendous activ-
ity. A network is equivalent to a graph and is charac-
terised by the links which connect pairs of nodes. Based
on observations and theoretical arguments, it has been
established that factors like preferential attachment, du-
plication, geographical distance, aging etc. are responsi-
ble in determining the connectivity in many real world
networks [2].

A scientiﬁc collaboration network is an example of a
social network [3] in which the scientists are the nodes
and a link is established between two scientists if they
co-author a paper. Scientiﬁc collaboration networks of
diﬀerent types have been studied in detail for quite a few
real databases [4, 5, 6, 7]. The average shortest distance
in these networks turns out to be of the order of log(N ),
where N is the total number of authors in these networks
indicating that they form small world networks. In fact,
in [6], the data indicated that the average shortest dis-
tance might as well decrease with N when N is allowed
to vary. The degree distribution has a power law tail
for many of the data bases, especially when the aver-
age degree is quite high, e.g., in the MEDLINE data [4].
When the average degree is quite small, e.g., in the hep-
th database, there is apparently an exponential cutoﬀ.
There could also be two regimes of power law behaviour
as argued in [6]. The clustering coeﬃcient for collab-
oration networks is usually quite high as any collabo-
ration involving more than two authors will invariably
contribute to the clustering coeﬃcient [2]. Collaboration
networks are also known to have a positive assortativity
[3, 8].

Modelling of the collaboration network has been at-
tempted in several studies [9] assuming a scheme where
nodes are added regularly and they get attached to the
existing nodes obeying a deﬁnite rule. In these models,
the eﬀect of time and geographical distances are usu-
ally ignored. Recent research has shown, on the other
hand, that geographical distance is a major factor deter-

mining scientiﬁc collaborations within or across countries
[10, 11, 12, 13]. The question of distance dependence of
links in real Euclidean networks has been addressed in
several other real world networks [14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. In
collaboration networks, the link lengths are also expected
to depend on time. In earlier times, collaborations were
largely limited between scientists located close to each
other, as it required face to face interactions to a consid-
erable extent. The cost and inconvenience of communi-
cation and travelling was largely responsible for collab-
orations taking place locally in majority of cases. With
the communication undergoing rapid improvement in the
form of e-mails, electronic ﬁle transfer, fax, telephone
etc., much larger number of long distance collaborations
have been possible in more recent times.

Thus it is expected that if the link length distributions
in a scientiﬁc collaboration network are calculated at dif-
ferent times, it would show a noticeable change with the
probability of large link lengths increasing in time. A
few theoretical models of networks have considered links
to be distance dependent [19]. A model for collabora-
tion network should in principle contain both distance
and time dependent factors. However, one needs to have
a quantitative idea of the eﬀect of time and distance in
real collaboration networks. The few studies which are
available [10, 11, 12, 13], do not give a complete picture.
Since collaboration networks can be deﬁned in a variety of
ways (e.g., based on a particular journal, based on one or
more scientiﬁc communities independent of any journal
etc.) it is diﬃcult to speak of an absolute picture. In the
present study we have attempted to model a particular
kind of collaboration network based on our observations
of the data of Physical Review Letters (PRL) from the
year 1965 to 2005.

In section II we discuss the real world data available so
far and report in detail our own observations of the PRL
data. In sec III, we discuss the model and in section IV
we summarise and discuss the results.

II. REAL WORLD DATA

In [10], the distribution of geographical distances be-
tween co-authors was studied restricting the studies to
individual countries. The results showed an exponen-
tial decrease with distance. The time evolution was not
studied in this case. Obviously inter continent or inter
country data were not considered here so the link lengths
are restricted to a large extent. The data was also up
to 1990, when the communication revolution was yet to
take shape. In [11], it was shown that the geographical
proximity has the greatest impact on transnational col-
laborations when compared to other (thematic and socio-
economic) factors. In [12], the link geographical distance
between Economists sharing publications was considered
as an example to support a general model of social net-
work in the background of technological advancement.
Publications which had at least one collaborator from
the US were considered only and data for the ﬁrst two
authors of each paper were taken. The distance factor
It was indeed found that in-
was also coarse grained.
dividual separations decrease with time. However, the
exact behaviour of the distribution of link lengths was
not presented possibly because of the restricted nature
of the data. In [13], it was concluded that improvement
of communication alone cannot help in long distance col-
laborations as there are other factors involved.

To obtain the link length distribution in a scientiﬁc
collaboration network, one should, in principle, take the
network of collaborators of the particular type one is in-
terested in (e.g., physicists, economists or maybe even
more specialised, like only condensed matter physicists)
and calculate the geographical distances separating them
at the time of a collaboration. However, it is more con-
venient to take a journal based data as has been done
previously in many studies. We have therefore taken
sample papers (at least 200 for each year for nine dif-
ferent years between 1965 to 2005) randomly from the
Physical Review Letters. The task is then to calculate
the pairwise geographical distance between the host in-
stitutes of the authors coauthoring a paper. However,
since these addresses span the whole world, this involves
data over a wide range. Also, the within city and within
institute/university distances are not readily available.
We have therefore obtained the distance distribution in
an indirect and coarse grained way which is described in
the following.

To author X in a paper we associate the indices
x1, x2, x3 and x4 (xi’s are integers) which represent the
University/Institute, city, country and continent of X re-
spectively. Similar indices y1, y2, y3 and y4 are deﬁned
for author Y. If, for example, authors X and Y belong to
the same institute, xi = yi = 1 for all i. On the other
hand, if they are from diﬀerent countries but the from
same continent, x4 = y4 but xi 6= yi for i < 4. We ﬁnd
out for what maximum value of k, xk 6= yk. The dis-
tance between X and Y is then lXY = k + 1. If xi = yi
for all values of i it means lXY = 1 according to our

FIG. 1: Relation between actual distance D (in km) and
coarse grained distance l. The data for l = 3, 4 and 5 are
from real distances averaged over 50 to 100 data and for l = 1
and l = 2, we assume some realistic average values of 0.1 km
and 10 km (shown by × symbols) respectively. The data ﬁts
fairly well to 1.5 exp(1.8l) − 10.

convention. As an example, one may consider the paper
PRL 64 2870 (1990), which features 4 authors. Here au-
thors 1 and 2 are from the same institute in Calcutta,
India, and are assigned the variables 1, 1, 1, 1. The 3rd
author belongs to a diﬀerent institute in Calcutta and
therefore gets the indices 2, 1, 1, 1. The last author is
from an institute in Bombay, India, and is assigned the
variables 3, 2, 1, 1. Hence the pairwise distances are:
l12 = 1, l13 = l23 = 2, l14 = l24 = l34 = 3. The pair-wise
distances l gives the distribution P (l) of the distance be-
tween two collaborating authors. We have also deﬁned a
distance factor d for each paper where d is the average of
the pair-wise distances of authors coauthoring that pa-
per. The corresponding distribution Q(d) has also been
computed. In the above example, the average d = 2.333.
Note that in P (l), the fact that l12, l13 and l23 are ob-
tained from a single collaboration act is missing. Hence,
in a sense, Q(d) takes care of the correlation between the
distances. Let us call Q(d) the correlated distance distri-
bution. Deﬁning the distances in this way, the values of
l are discrete while the d values have a continuous varia-
tion. For papers with two authors, the two distributions
are identical but will be diﬀerent in general.

In order to show that our coarse graining of distances
is consistent with the actual distances, we have picked up
cities at random and plotted the real distance D against
the coarse grained distance l in Fig. 1. Real data is
available for l = 3, 4 and 5 [20] only as l = 1 and 2
correspond to within institute and within city distances
respectively. For these two l values, we have assumed
realistic average values of D, e.g., D ∼ 0.1km for l = 1
and D ∼ 10 km for l = 2 and shown in the same plot. We
ﬁnd that there is indeed a correlation between D and l.
With only such a few points, it is diﬃcult to ascertain the
exact behaviour of D with l, D ∼ exp(αlβ) with β ∼ 1
could be a possible ﬁt as shown in the ﬁgure.

We have made exception for USA authors since it is
a big country comparable in size to Europe which con-
sists of many countries. (Of course there are other big
countries in the world but majority of contributions to
PRL are from the USA and Europe.) Thus two authors
belonging to, say, Kentucky and Maryland will have dif-
ferent country indices, i.e., x3 6= y3.

Some papers like the experimental high energy physics
ones typically involve many authors and many institutes.
We have considered an upper bound, equal to 20, to the
number of institutes and no bound for the number of
authors. In case of multiple addresses, only the ﬁrst one
has been considered.

In Figs. 2 and 3, the distributions P (l) and Q(d) are
shown. The two distributions have similar features but
diﬀer in magnitude, more so in recent years, when the
number of authors is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from two in
many papers.

Both the distributions P (l) and Q(d) are non mono-

tonic and have the following features:
1. A peak at l or d = 1
2. A sharp fall at around l or d = 2 and a subsequent

rise. The fall becomes less steep in time.
The feature of a secondary hump is similar to that ob-
tained for internet and airlines ﬂights networks [15].
3. Even for the most recent data, the peak at nearest
neighbour distances is quite dominant. However, with
the passage of time, the peak value at nearest neighbour
distances shrinks while the probability at larger distances
increases.

We have made a detailed analysis of Q(d), the corre-
lated distance distribution.
In Fig. 4, we present the
results. The mean increases appreciably in consistency
with our idea that with the progress of time there will
be more collaborations involving people working at a dis-
tance. The ﬂuctuation also shows an increase, although
its increase is not that remarkable since the total range of
interaction remains ﬁxed in our convention. If collabora-
tions were really distance independent, the distributions
Q(d) and P (l) would have looked ﬂat. We have estimated
the deviation of Q(d) from a ﬂat distribution by calcu-
lating its “roughness” RQ deﬁned as ph(Q(d) − ¯Q(d))2i
where ¯Q(d) is the mean value of Q(d). RQ shows a de-
crease with time which is approximately linear.

The above results imply that even with the communi-
cation revolution, most collaborations take place among
nearest geographical neighbours. The drop near d = 2
maybe justiﬁed from the fact that in most cities one has
only one university/institute and when one collaborates
with an outsider, she or he belongs to some other city
or country in most cases. There is some indication that
in the not too distant future collaborations will become
almost distance independent as in Fig. 4, RQ seems to
vanish at around 2040 when extrapolated. This will mean
that the collaboration network takes the nature of a ran-
dom network where any two nodes have a ﬁnite proba-
bility of being connected. It may also happen that RQ
saturates to a ﬁnite value in the coming years, and per-
haps it is too early to predict anything deﬁnite.

III. MODEL OF COLLABORATION NETWORK

ously, P (l) and Q(d) are indistinguishable now.

In this section we present a model of the collabora-
tion network in which spatial and temporal eﬀects are
involved. The aim is to ﬁnd out the appropriate scheme
by which the links are formed in the network such that
the observed results are reproduced. We have taken a
two dimensional space where nodes (authors) can occur
randomly and each node is assigned coordinates x1, x2
where 0 ≤ xi ≤ 1. Initially we start with a few nodes
with a probability p0 to have a link with each other. At
each time step, one new node is introduced. The links
are then formed according to the scheme mentioned be-
low:
(a) The new node will get attached to its nearest neigh-
bour (Euclidean) with certainty.
(b) It then forms links with probability p to the neigh-
bours of its nearest neighbour.
(c) It also gets attached to the other existing nodes with
probability q.
In both steps (b) and (c), there can be attachment to
more than one node in general. In step (a), distance de-
pendence has been incorporated. Step (b) is to ensure
that there is a high clustering. Step (c) has been taken
to incorporate the connections with neighbours at arbi-
trary distances. To keep the model simple, we do not
allow new links to form between the older nodes. Notice
that p0 is taken only to ensure that a connected network
is formed and its value should be kept small. The dis-
tance dependence in this model is incorporated by the
fact that a new node always gets a link with its imme-
diate neighbour. This is motivated by the behaviour of
the real data. (In reality, this may be interpreted as a
new research scholar getting involved in a collaboration
with her/his supervisor almost with certainty.) Since the
distance distributions change in time, one must also in-
corporate a time dependence in the linking scheme of the
model. p and q are the factors which may be time de-
pendent. However, in the spirit of the results obtained,
it is reasonable to assume that the time dependence of q
is more signiﬁcant and therefore we make q time depen-
dent and keep p time independent in the minimal model.
We take q = q0t where t is the discrete time. Time de-
pendent probability to connect to any existing node has
been considered somewhat similarly earlier in a model of
protein interaction network [21].

The time dependence in q ensures two factors: (i) as
time progresses, a new node gets more links and (ii) since
these are distance-independent, collaborations with dis-
tant neighbours increase with time. Both these are close
to reality. In this simple model, we also have only two-
author collaborations. Typically, in most Physics papers,
the number of co-authors vary between 2 and 4 [4]. We
have checked from the real data that the distance distri-
bution for papers with two authors is qualitatively very
similar to the total distribution (i.e., with any number
of authors) and therefore it is suﬃcient to consider two-
author collaborations only in the model network. Obvi-

The choice of q in the form q = qot obviously puts a
restriction on the size of the system simulated as q0N
should be suﬃciently less than 1. Rather than explore
the whole parameter space, we have attempted to ﬁnd
at least one set of values of p, q0 and N that would be
realistic and also have the observed properties of a col-
laboration network. The parameters have been initially
chosen such that the network shows the proper spatial
and temporal properties of the link length distribution,
since that was the chief objective of the present work.
Next, we have veriﬁed that the other properties are also
well reproduced with this speciﬁc choice. These values
are q0 = 10−6, p = 0.3 and N ∼ O(103). We report the
detailed results in the following subsections.

A. Distance distributions

In this subsection the simulation results for the link
length distribution is presented. We also state brieﬂy the
reason behind the choice of the values of the parameters
used in the simulations here.

During the evolution of the network, the Euclidean dis-
tances between each pair of nodes which share a link are
noted. In order to verify the behaviour of the distance
distribution at diﬀerent times, we have identiﬁed a spe-
ciﬁc number of iterations (nodes added) N0 with a test
time period, which we call a “year”. Here we present the
results of the simulation of a network with the number
of nodes N = 4N0, i.e., for 4 consecutive years. For each
period of N0 iterations (or one year), the distance distri-
butions are separately calculated (i.e., not cumulatively)
to compare directly with the observed data.

With both p and q equal to zero, the distribution
would simply have a power law decrease when nodes get
attached to their nearest neighbours only [22]. When
q0 = 0, N = 2000 and for ﬁnite values of p up to approxi-
mately 0.5 the distance distribution shows similarity with
the observed data in the sense that there is a peak at
small distances followed by a hump. This is observed for
all the four sets of N0 iteration steps corresponding to the
ﬁrst, second, third and fourth years (see Fig. 5). How-
ever, contrary to the observed data, the probability at
larger distances does not increase in the later years. This
data, in order to have correspondence with Fig. 2 and 3,
should be a presented in a log-linear plot (as l ∝ log(D)).
However, we ﬁnd that when the data is presented in this
way, the probability at larger distances are too small to
be visible and therefore we have shown the log-log plot.
This is another evidence that this model is not the proper
one.

For p > 0.5, the distribution becomes too ﬂat to agree
with the observed data for any year. Hence we try with
values of p less than 0.5 and q0 6= 0. With the same
value of N0, p = 0.3 and q0 = 1.0 × 10−6, we indeed

ﬁnd that the behaviour of the diﬀerent years reﬂects the
actual behaviour observed in the PRL data (Fig. 6).
Here, one can also present the data in the desired form,
i.e., a log-linear plot with the probabilities at large dis-
tances becoming signiﬁcantly larger compared to the case
of q0 = 0. For smaller values of p, the maximum degree
becomes much smaller compared to real world networks.
Also, making q0 order of magnitude smaller or larger
than 10−6 does not improve the quality of consistency
with observed data. Having obtained the optimal set of
parameter values at p = 0.3 and q0 = 1.0 × 10−6, we
compute the quantities shown in ﬁg. 4, viz., the mean
distance, standard deviation and roughness as functions
of time. Here slabs of 250 iterations have been taken to
correspond to one year to show a larger number of data
points and we ﬁnd that these show excellent agreement
with the observed data (Figs. 4 and 7).

B. Small world behaviour

We have studied the behaviour of hsi, the average
shortest path (i.e., the chemical distance) in the network
as it grows in size. The behaviour of hsi is shown in Fig.
7 as a function of the number of nodes, or equivalently
time. We ﬁnd that while it is of the order of log(N ) it
shows a non-monotonic behaviour with N . hsi increases
initially with N , reaches a peak and then decreases with
N . The decrease with N is consistent with the result in
[6] where a similar result was noted. The decrease maybe
attributed to the fact that the number of edges in the net-
work increases with time in an accelerated manner such
that the average degree increases as the network grows
in size. This is veriﬁed by noting the average degree hki
as a function of N (Fig. 7). It indeed shows a slow linear
increase in time agreeing to the behaviour seen in collab-
oration networks as reported earlier [6]. Note that if we
go on increasing the system size, non-linearity may oc-
cur in the behaviour of hki. However, such an increase is
unphysical due to many reasons. This will be discussed
in detail in the following section.

C. Clustering coeﬃcient

The clustering coeﬃcient hCi has been calculated by
taking the average clustering coeﬃcient of the individual
nodes given by

Ci = Σj1,j2

ki(ki + 1)

aj1j2 ,

(1)

where ki is the degree of node i and aj1j2 = 1 if nodes j1
and j2 are connected and zero otherwise. In social net-
works the clustering coeﬃcients are usually quite high,
more so for the scientiﬁc collaboration network. Here,
however, we do not ﬁnd such large values as we have

restricted to collaborations between two authors only.
However, comparing with the corresponding random net-
work, we do ﬁnd that they are much higher.
In Fig.
8, we have shown the variation of hCi as a function of
time for both the model network and the correspond-
ing random network.
It shows a slow decrease during
later times. This is again consistent with the results of
[6]. This may be related to the observation in [12] where
it was shown that while average geographical distance
between individual agents decrease, the group or clus-
ter activity decreases. Decrease of clustering coeﬃcient
with time implies the tendency of the network to become
random. However, since in reality, more than two author
collaborations tends to get higher with time this may not
actually be the case after all.

D. Degree Distribution

Degree distribution is an important property of net-

works as it determines its behaviour in many respects.

Here we have calculated the degree distribution for the

simulated model and plotted it in Fig. 10.

The degree distribution has a peak, and is quite similar
to that observed in [4] for some speciﬁc databases like the
cond-mat and hep-th as its decay ﬁts to the following
form

P (k) ∼ k

−c exp(−k/k0),

with k0 ∼ 5.6 and c ∼ 1.0. The value of c compares very
well with that of the observed ones for several databases
(e.g., c = 1.1 for both cond-mat and hep-th), while k0
is fairly close to the values obtained for cond-mat and
hep-th which are 15.7 and 9.4 respectively [4].

It maybe mentioned here that the nature of degree
distribution depends largely on the particular database
under consideration. Our results are closer to that of
cond-mat or hep-th databases in which the degree dis-
tribution is not a power law. Our model, which allows
only two-author collaborations, is not expected to match
the data of SPIRES or MEDLINE where collaborations
involve a large number of researchers and a power-law
degree distribution has been observed.

E. Assortative mixing

The assortativity is also another important property
of the collaboration network. Brieﬂy, it is the degree
correlation of nodes on either end of a chosen edge. Here
we calculate the assortativity by calculating the average
degree hknn(k)i of the nearest neighbours of a node with

degree k. The results show a positive assortativity as
hknn(k)i clearly increases with k (see Fig. 9). This is
again consistent with real world observations that social
networks have a positive assortativity [3, 8].

IV. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSIONS

In this paper, we have reported the results of simu-
lating a scientiﬁc collaboration network in which both
time and space play an important role in the growth of
the model network. The results are compared with the
observed data of collaboration networks, emphasising on
the link length distribution at diﬀerent times as this is a
feature not studied in earlier simulations of the collabora-
tion networks. The results for the link length distribution
agree very well with the observation of the collaborative
network of Physical Review Letters presented in section
II. To test the quality of the model, we have evaluated
other network properties for which real data is available
in the literature and found reasonably good consistency.
This growing network model does not take into account
a few features like the ‘death’ of nodes, change in posi-
tion of the nodes, more than two author collaborations
and collaborations between nodes already in the network.
These features could easily be incorporated in the model
at the cost of a few new parameters. We wanted to re-
strict our model within a few parameters to keep it simple
and yet realistic. Keeping only two node collaborations
makes our results comparable to some speciﬁc databases
as far as the degree distribution is concerned (there is an
exponential cutoﬀ). All other properties of a collabora-
tion network have been successfully reproduced.

Ignoring death of nodes simply means that generation
of the network should remain limited to ﬁnite values of
N , otherwise the number of links increases in a nonlinear
manner. Also, q becomes unrealistically high.

New interactions between old nodes would make the
number of publications per “year” very high which is
not very realistic. A recent study [7] shows that most
authors tend to write papers with their old collaborators
with more probability, so that the growth scheme would
not be altered much even if one admits such connections
and the results should remain more or less the same.

For small distances, P (l) shows a power law decay con-
trary to the result of [10] where an exponential decay is
obtained. Neither the results in [12] nor our results for
the PRL data are suﬃcient to indicate the exact varia-
tion of P (l) with l as distances have been coarse grained
in both. However, a simple argument leads to the con-
clusion that the small l behaviour of P (l), presented in
Fig. 2, may have a power law decay behaviour. We no-
tice that there is a sharp decrease of P (l) with l for small
l which may be assumed to be exponential in nature. We
have already argued that real distances scale roughly as
exp(αlβ) where β is of the order of unity. In that case,
the initial exponential decay of P (l) with l corresponds
to a power law decrease with true distances D. In [10],

the data base was diﬀerently generated which may be
the cause of the discrepancy in the behaviour of P (D)
for small D. Our simulations also show a sharp decrease
of P (D) with log(D).

It may be mentioned here that for the real world data,
we have coarse grained the distance (according to cities,
countries, continents etc.) while no such scheme was
taken up for the model. Even then, the link length distri-
bution from the simulation shows reasonably good agree-
ment with the data. The reason is that a new node in the
simulation invariably links up with its nearest node, and
this nearest node is expected to lie suﬃciently ‘close’ to it
(nodes exist randomly all over the space) so the distribu-
tion P (D) at small distances gets enriched. The existence
of the ‘dip’ in P (D) in the simulation result can be ex-
plained in the following way: we have connections with
neighbours at arbitrary distances through steps (b) and
(c) (in fact step (c) contributes more towards this). In
a Euclidean space, the number of points lying within a
shell of thickness dr at a distance r is 2πrdr in two di-
mensions. Naturally, the number of such points increases
with r, and therefore an increase in P (D) at greater D
is possible resulting in a dip in between.

In generating the network here, we could have assumed
a form of P (D) as has been done earlier [19] rather than
using the scheme described in the beginning of section
III. But we have not attempted to do this for two rea-
sons
1. The exact form of P (D) is unknown, neither does it
seem to be a simple one.
2. The present scheme, being successful, helps to de-
velop newer insight in the evolution of the collaboration
network.

The question may now arise that whether ignoring the
distance dependence while constructing a model of col-
laboration network is justiﬁed, which has been done in
earlier works. This leads to an intriguing realisation.
In the present model, the distance dependence matters
for nearest neighbours only. Indeed, even in the present
model one can ignore the distance factor when a diﬀer-
ent perspective is taken. Instead of assuming that a new
node is born randomly at any position and that it gets
connected to its nearest neighbour, one may suppose that
a random node (i.e., the existing nearest neighbour or the
parent) has duplicated and the duplicated node (daugh-
ter) is always connected to the parent. The daughter
node is also connected with probability p to its parent’s
neighbours and with q to others. This is then simply a
non-Euclidean network! Obviously this equivalent non-
Euclidean model does not carry any information of the
distance dependence but would give us the same values of
shortest paths, clustering coeﬃcients, degree distribution
and assortativity.

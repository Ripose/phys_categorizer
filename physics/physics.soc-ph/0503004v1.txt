In this work we extend the model of Bonabeau et al. in the case of scale-free networks. A sharp
transition is observed from an egalitarian to an hierarchical society, with a very low population
density threshold. The exact threshold value also depends on the network size. We ﬁnd that in an
hierarchical society the number of individuals with strong winning attitude is much lower than the
number of the community members that have a low winning probability.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Self-organization of society structures and the forma-
tion of hierarchies has always been an important issue in
sociological studies.[1, 2] Recently, a fresh point of view in
the same problem was introduced through application of
statistical physics concepts and methods. A simple, yet
powerful enough, model was introduced by Bonabeau et
al.[3] in order to explain the uneven distribution of fame,
wealth, etc. The model was further modiﬁed later by
Stauﬀer,[4, 5] who introduced a feedback mechanism for
determining the probability of one’s social rise or fall in
the hierarchy.

The above model places the interacting individuals on
a lattice, so that the space, as experienced by a partici-
pant, is homogenous. Recently, though, a huge number
of observations on social (among many others) systems
has revealed a strongly inhomogeneous character in the
number of connections between individuals.[6, 7] In the
present study, thus, we extend the model of Bonabeau et
al. in the case where the substrate of the agents motion
and interaction is such a scale-free network.

II. THE MODEL

In the original version of the model proposed by
Bonabeau et al.[3] a number of agents are distributed
randomly on a L×L lattice, occupying a concetration p of
the total number of lattice sites. Each site can host only
one individual. These individuals perform isotropic ran-
dom walks on the lattice. A random agent is chosen and
moves equiprobably to one of its four neighboring sites,
while the system time advances by 1/pN (when all indi-
viduals have moved on average once, time is considered
to have advanced by one Monte-Carlo step). Each per-
son i is characterized by a parameter hi which is a mea-
sure of an individual’s ‘ﬁtness’ and can represent wealth,
power, or any property that is judged to be important in
a society. Initially all participating agents are of equal
status (hi = 1) and there is no hierarchy in the popula-
tion. When in the process of the random walk, though,
an individual i tries to visit a site already occupied by
If
another person j, there is a ﬁght between the two.

the ‘attacking’ person wins then i and j exchange their
positions. Otherwise, they remain in their original sites.
The outcome of the ﬁght depends on the ‘strength’ h of
the two opponents, with a probability q that i wins over
j:

q =

1
1 + exp [η(hj − hi)]

,

(1)

where η is a free parameter, with a constant value within
each realization. After a ﬁght the ﬁtness h of a per-
son participating in a ﬁght is updated: the ﬁtness of the
winner h increases by 1, while the ﬁtness of the loser de-
creases by 1. Thus, the variable hi measures the number
of wins minus the number of losses, but it is also mod-
iﬁed by an eﬀect of fading memory. After one Monte
Carlo step the ﬁtness of all individuals decreases to 90%
of its current value. In other words, in order to keep a
large enough strength it is not enough to have won a lot
of ﬁghts in the past and remain inactive, but one must
always retain one’s strength by participating (and win-
ning) in ﬁghts. When the density of participants is low,
this memory loss is the prevailing mechanism that drives
the system towards the egalitarian status, since ﬁghts in
that case are rare.

The level of separation in a society is measured via an
order parameter, which is taken to be the dispersion in
the probability of winning a ﬁght

The average is considered over all ﬁghts occuring within
one Monte Carlo time step. A large value of σ reveals
an hierarchical society where the probability of winning
diﬀers considerably among the population. On the con-
trary, values of σ close to zero imply that on the average
all society members ‘ﬁght’ each other in terms of equiv-
alent forces.

In the original paper a phase transition was observed
upon increasing the density p, from σ = 0 to a ﬁnite σ
value. Sousa and Stauﬀer,[4] though, pointed out that
the transition was an artifact of the simulations and
this transition was in fact absent. Later, Stauﬀer pro-
posed a diﬀerent mechanism for calculating the winning
probability,[5] where feedback from the current system

state was introduced in the following form:

q =

1 + exp [σ(hj − hi)]

.

(3)

In this case, an hierarchically organized population (large
σ value) enhances the probability of the strongest mem-
ber to win, and thus introduces a preference towards al-
ready strong individuals. This mechanism restored the
sharp transition of σ with increasing q, yielding a critical
value close to qc = 0.32.

In this work we apply the modiﬁed model of Eq. (3)
on scale-free networks. A scale-free network is a graph
where the probability that a node has k links to other
nodes follows a power law

P (k) ∼ k

−γ ,

(4)

where usually 2 < γ < 4. We prepare a number of diﬀer-
ent networks (typically of the order of 100) with a given
γ value using the conﬁguration model: First, the number
of links for each node is determined by drawing random
numbers from the distribution (4) and then links are es-
tablished between randomly chosen pairs of nodes. Care
is taken to avoid self-links or double links between two
nodes. This process may create isolated clusters of nodes,
so in our simulations we only keep the largest cluster in
the system which (depending on γ) comprises 35-100%
of the number of system nodes N .

Individuals are randomly placed on the system nodes
and move along the links. A person on a node with k
connections choses randomly one of the connected nodes
with probability 1/k and tries to jump there. If the node
is occupied a ﬁght takes place under the same rules as in
the case of the lattice.

III. RESULTS

In Fig. 1(a) we present the distribution of q for dif-
ferent population densities p, for networks with γ = 3.0,
and N = 105 nodes. We have veriﬁed that the observed
behavior is in general valid for other values of γ as well.
When p is very small, there are only rare encounters be-
tween the individuals and all winning probabilities are
equal to 0.5, which yields a delta function distribution
up to p = 0.04. When p becomes greater than p = 0.05
the form of the distribution changes drastically. The peak
is getting lower, until it completely dissapears. Now, in
the region around p = 0.1 all winning probabilities are
almost equiprobable and evenly distributed among the
population. Upon further increasing p a strong polariza-
tion arises in the population with most people having a
vanishing winning probability. Very few individuals have
intermediate values of q, and another peak appears in
the distribution close to the area of complete dominance
q = 1. The intensity of this peak is lower than the peak
at q = 0, indicating that the clique of ‘strong’ individuals
has fewer members than the community of low-‘strength’
members.

density p of the population, (a) on the largest cluster of a
network with γ = 3.0 and N = 105 nodes, and (b) on regular
two-dimensional lattice.

Comparison with the case of a lattice (shown in
Fig. 1(b)) reveals some interesting features. The general
behavior is similar (going from a delta function to uni-
form distribution to increasing peaks at the edges of the
distribution). However, the range over where these tran-
sitions take place is very diﬀerent, with networks leaving
the egalitarian state in much lower densities (notice the
logarithmic axis of p in Fig. 1(a)). More important is the
observation that on a lattice the two peaks of the win-
ning probability distribution at high population densities
are completely symmetric. This symmetry is due to the
homogeneity of the lattice, contrary to the result for the
scale-free networks. On a network, when an individual
with high winning probability is placed on a hub will
ﬁght against many opponents, who have lower q. These
low-q individuals at the branches of the hub try to pass
through the hub, where they will probably lose the ﬁght.
In this way, they will become weaker while they will fur-

ther strengthen the already strong person. In practice,
one strong individual can keep a quite large number of
weaker people into a losing state, which is the mechanism
underlying the observed assymetry in the two peaks. In
general, roughly 60-65% of the individuals belong to the
q ∼ 0 community and 20-25% belong to the q ∼ 1 clique.
The observed change in the distribution shape with
increasing p already hints the existence of a sharp phase
transition. This transition is indeed veriﬁed by our sim-
ulations, when using our order parameter σ. The results
are presented in ﬁgure 2.

The critical threshold for all γ values is signiﬁcantly
lower than in the case of lattices (where pc = 0.32). In
fact, when γ = 2.25 or γ = 2.5 there is almost no thresh-
old and an hierarchical society emerges as soon as there
is a non-zero population on the lattice, due to the fre-
quent encounters. For γ ≥ 3 the threshold has a ﬁnite
value, which is still in low densities, of the order of 0.05.
It is also noteworthy that for networks with low γ, the
asymptotic value of the order parameter is smaller than
the one for networks with large γ values. This shows
that the most-connected networks initially establish an
hierarchical society at lower densities than less connected
networks, but retain a lower level of hierarchy at larger
densities.

The network heterogeneity also introduces another ef-
fect, apart from moving the critical threshold closer to
p = 0. For concentrations close to criticality from below,
the behavior of σ in networks of the same γ may be very
diﬀerent. Thus, for e.g. γ = 3.0 and p = 0.5, in most
realizations the value σ vanishes in a few hundrend steps.

to N = 106. Results for (a) γ = 2.5 and (b) γ = 3.0.

izations, though, we have observed that σ would retain a
large value and ﬂuctuate around σ = 0.3 even after 104
steps. Inspection of these realizations revealed that al-
most all of them ﬁnally converge to σ = 0, but the time
for equilibration may be of the order of 106 steps or even
more, while the ﬂuctuations in the value of σ with time
are large (σ can assume values very close to 0 or rise up
to 0.45, before settling to σ = 0). These long relaxation
times and the wide dispersion of σ show that a society
with a density close to the criticality on a scale-free net-
work may remain in turbulence for a long time, and even
a small number of individuals may separate into diﬀer-
ent hierarchies for a signiﬁcant duration, before ﬁnally
settling to an egalitarian society.

Finally, we studied the eﬀect of the network size on our
presented results (Fig. 3). The curves seem to converge
for networks of N = 105-106 nodes. For a given γ value,
all network sizes used follow roughly a common curve at
large population densities. The transition threshold, on
the other hand, varies with N . Increasing the network

size leads to a lower transition value pc. The value of pc
for γ = 2.5 tends to 0, for large enough networks, while
for γ = 3.0 it tends to a small value of around pc = 0.04.
Inspection of other γ values indicates that in the range
2 < γ < 3 the value of pc tends to zero with increasing
network size, while when 3 < γ < 4 the transition point
is around pc = 0.05.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this work we studied the model of Bonabeau for
the case where the population moves on the nodes of a
scale-free network. A number of important diﬀerences
were observed, as compared to the case of lattice diﬀu-
sion. The heterogeneity of the scale-free structure and
the diﬀerent behavior of the diﬀusion process strongly
aﬀect the results of the model. For example, it is known
that diﬀusion is not a very eﬃcient process on networks,
in the sense that a random walker can never really get
away from the origin on ﬁnite-size networks [8, 9]. This

4

factor causes the individuals to remain close to each other
and a large number of encounters take place, even there
are only few individuals. This results in a extremely low
value of the density threshold that separates egalitarian
from hierarchical societies. In fact, for γ < 3 there is a
strong indication from the simulations that pc = 0, at
least for large network sizes N .

The number of individuals with strong probability of
winning is also signiﬁcantly lower than the number of
people that cannot easily win a ﬁght and thus climb in
the hierarchy. This assymetry is not observed in lattices,
where the isotropic environment of motion equally favors
the development of the two separated communities, but
with equal number of members.

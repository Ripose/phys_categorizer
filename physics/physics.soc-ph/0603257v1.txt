Abstract

The urban road networks of the 20 largest German cities have been analysed, based
on a detailed database providing the geographical positions as well as the travel-
times for network sizes up to 37,000 nodes and 87,000 links. As the human driver
recognises travel-times rather than distances, faster roads appear to be ‘shorter’
than slower ones. The resulting metric space has an eﬀective dimension d > 2,
which is a signiﬁcant measure of the heterogeneity of road speeds. We found that
traﬃc strongly concentrates on only a small fraction of the roads. The distribution
of vehicular ﬂows over the roads obeys a power-law, indicating a clear hierarchical
order of the roads. Studying the cellular structure of the areas enclosed by the roads,
the distribution of cell sizes is scale invariant as well.

1 Introduction

The scientiﬁc interest in network analysis has been steadily growing since the
revolutionary discoveries of Watts and Strogatz [1] and Barab´asi and Albert
[2]. They found out that many real-world networks such as the internet and
social networks exhibit a scale-free structure characterised by a high clustering
coeﬃcient and small average path lengths. The path lengths, however, are
usually not related to geographical distances. Surprisingly, little attention has
been paid to the spatial structure of networks, even though distances are very
crucial for logistic, geographical and transportation networks.

Urban road networks with links and nodes representing road segments and
junctions, respectively, exhibit unique features diﬀerent from other classes of
networks [3,4,5,6,7,8]. As they are almost planar, they show a very limited
range of node degrees. Thus, they can never be scale-free like airline networks
or the internet [5]. Nevertheless, there exists an interesting connection between
these scale-free networks on the one hand and road networks on the other hand,
since both are extreme cases of an optimisation process minimising average
travel costs along all shortest paths, given a set of nodes and a total link
length. The properties of the resulting networks strongly depend on the links’
cost function. If the travel costs on all links were equal, small-world networks
with a hub-and-spoke architecture typical for airline networks or the internet
would emerge. However, with travel costs proportional to the link length, the
resulting networks would exhibit properties typical for road networks [5].

We have extracted road network data of the administrative areas of
the 20 largest German cities from the geographical database Tele Atlas
MultiNetTM[9], typically used for real-time navigation systems or urban plan-
ning and management. The data provide a geo-coded polygon for each road
segment as well as a series of properties, e.g. the length, the average expected
travel-time, the speed limit, the driving directions etc. Junctions and homoge-
neous road segments of the selected areas are represented by nodes and links of
a corresponding directed graph. The location of the cities within Germany and
the corresponding networks sizes are shown in Fig. 1 and Table 1. Since the
road network of Hanover, ranked 11th, could not be extracted unambiguously,
it was excluded from our analysis.

2 Eﬀective Dimension

In transportation networks with strong geographical constraints, it is observed
that the sizes of neighbourhoods grow according to a power-law [10]. We study
properties and implications of such scaling in urban road networks, where
distances are, with respect to human driver’s recognition, related to travel
times. Human travel behaviour underlies the universal law of a constant energy
budget [11]. The cost of travel must, therefore, not be measured in the number
of road meters, but in the amount of energy or, assuming a single mode of
transport with a constant energy consumption rate, e.g. car driving, in units
of travel-time. Interestingly, this implies that routes along faster roads appear
‘shorter’ than slower ones in terms of travel-time. A distant but well accessible
destination is virtually closer than a near one with a longer time to access.
The virtual compression of faster and the dilation of slower roads result in an
eﬀective deformation of the urban space, whose metric structure we’re going
to study.

For any node in the road network, the number of nodes reachable with a
given travel-distance budget r, i.e. the number of nodes to which the shortest
path is shorter than r, essentially scales with a maximum exponent of 2. This
fact is independent of whether the graph is planar in a strict sense or the
urban landscape is uneven. Considering shortest paths with respect to travel-
time instead, the number of nodes Nv(τ ) reachable with a travel-time budget
τ follows a scaling law Nv(τ ) ∼ τ δ with δ being signiﬁcantly larger than 2
for all road networks under consideration, see Table 1. The scaling exponent
δ is called the eﬀective dimension [5]. The existence of arterial roads with
road speeds above average allows car drivers to reach distant places over-
proportionally fast, which results in higher values of δ. Thus, the eﬀective
dimension can be used as a measure of the heterogeneity of the road speeds.
Fig. 1(a) shows the areas reachable from a central node within diﬀerent travel-
time budgets.

Referring to [10,5], the eﬀective dimension δ is theoretically deﬁned by

δ = lim
τ →∞

d log Nv(τ )
d log τ

.

(1)

Since road networks are ﬁnite, however, this formula has to be approximated.
For all nodes we have computed the average N v(τ ) and plotted it over τ in
double logarithmic scale as shown in Fig. 2(b). For larger values of τ , the
curve saturates due to the ﬁnite number of nodes in the graph. The slope of
this curve at its inﬂection point gives the lower bound for an estimation of
δ (dotted line). Alternatively, one could also periodically continue the graph,
e.g. by mirroring a rectangular part of it and estimate the limit for τ → ∞.

Figure 2. (a) Isochrones (bold lines) surround areas reachable from a point in the
city centre of Dresden with diﬀerent travel-time budgets τ1 : τ2 : τ3 = 1 : 2 : 3. These
areas extend wider along fast roads, e.g. in the north, while they are compressed
along slower roads, e.g. in the east. (b) Average number N v(τ ) of nodes reachable
within a travel-time budget τ .

3 Distribution of Traﬃc

The heterogeneity of road speeds also has an impact on the distribution of
vehicular traﬃc in the road network. Faster roads are more attractive for
human drivers, resulting in a concentration of traﬃc along these roads, see
Fig. 3.

The importance of a road or a junction can be characterised by the num-
ber of cars passing through it within some time interval. This can roughly be
approximated with the measure of link betweenness centrality be and node be-
tweenness centrality bv. It is given by the number of shortest paths with respect
to travel-time between all pairs of nodes in the corresponding graph, of which
the particular link e or node v is part of [12,13,14,7,8]. Using the measure of
betweenness centrality holds, we assume equally distributed origin-destination
pairs, identical average departure rates, and the absence of externalities. Even
though these assumptions might not hold for precise traﬃc ﬂow predictions,
they allow for estimating the implications of the network topology on the
spatial distribution of traﬃc ﬂows.

The German road networks show an extremely high node betweenness cen-
trality bv at only a small number of nodes, while its values are very low at the
majority of nodes. Fig. 4(a) shows the distribution of its relative frequency
density p(bv). Over the entire range, the distribution follows the scale-free
power-law p(bv) ∼ b−β
v with the exponent β = 1.355 for Dresden, see also
Table 1. High values of β can be interpreted as a high concentration of traﬃc
on the most important intersections.

5

Figure 3. Shortest paths in the road network of Dresden. The width of the links
corresponds to the respective betweenness centrality be, that is an approximate
measure of the amount of traﬃc on that roads.

Studying the link betweenness centrality be reveals a similar picture: The traﬃc
volume is highly concentrated on only a few roads, or to be more precise,
on only a few road meters. By referring to road meters instead of roads we
overcome the eﬀect of diﬀerent road lengths. As a quantitative concentration
measure we use the Gini index g, which can be obtained from the Lorenz
curve [15]. The Lorenz curve is an monotonously increasing and convex curve
joining the points (F, P ), where F is the fraction of all road meters that have
a fraction P of the total length of all shortest paths leading over it. The Gini
index g is deﬁned as twice the area between the Lorenz curve and the diagonal.
In the extreme case of a perfect equal distribution, the Lorenz curve would
follow the diagonal with g = 0. In the other extreme case of a distribution
similar to delta function, we would ﬁnd P = 0 for all F < 1, and P = 1
if F =1, and the Gini index would be g = 1. The Lorenz curve for the road
network of Dresden is shown in Fig. 4(b) and can be interpreted as follows:
50% of all road meters carry as little as 0.2% of the total traﬃc volume only
(I), while almost 80% of the total traﬃc volume are concentrated on no more
than 10% of the roads (II). Most interestingly, half of the total traﬃc volume
is handled by only 3.2% of the roads in the network (III). The related Gini
index of Dresden is g = 0.870, see Table 1.

(a) The distribution of the node betweenness centrality bv obeys the
−β
v with the exponent β = 1.355 for Dresden (dotted line). (b)

The bundling of traﬃc streams on a few arterial roads reﬂects the clear hi-
erarchical structure of the roads. The existence of hierarchies is an inherent
property of transportation networks [16]. Fig. 3 shows that the arterial roads
sprawl out from the city centre in all direction of the network.

Besides the diversity of road speeds, the inherent structure of the road network
topology itself has a tremendous eﬀect on the emergence of road hierarchies.
Dead-end roads, for example, are at the lowest level of the road hierarchy by
deﬁnition. Interestingly, the fraction of dead-end roads or, more precisely, the
fraction of tree-like structures in the corresponding graph, is about 20% of
the total road length in the network of Dresden. Some of the dead-ends may
belong to the boundary of the road network, but their fraction should be small
since only a few country roads or highways are cut. Such tree-like structures,
also referred to as ‘lollipop’ layouts, are typical for modern North American
suburbs [8] and are found among the 20 German cities under consideration as
well.

4 Cellular Structures

The structure and spatial extension of trail systems [17,18] is constrained by
the presence of impenetrable or inaccessible places. The structure of road net-
works, therefore, is a result of an interplay between travel cost minimisation
and eﬃcient land use. Facilities, residences, parks etc. are enclosed by the
roads, letting the road network appear as a two-dimensional cellular system.
Such structures are typical for trail systems as well as for self-generated struc-
tures like crack patterns, maple leaves, dragonﬂy wings etc. [19].

found in all 20 German road networks. (b) The frequency distribution of the cell’s
surface areas Ac obeys the scale-free power-law P (Ac) ∼ A−α
(dotted line) with
the exponent α = 1.892 for the road network of Dresden.

c

The topology of two-dimensional cellular structures has been studied in the
domain of planar graph theory [20,21] since Euler, whose theorem states that
the number Nc of bounded cells in a connected planar graph with Nv nodes
and Ne undirected links is given with Nc = Ne − Nv + 1. The graph of road
networks is always connected but, due to the presence of bridges and tunnels,
obviously not planar in a strict sense, as is required for the deﬁnition of cells.
Thus, for our investigations, we determined all pairs of crossing links and
connected them by adding virtual nodes at the crossing points.

A cell’s neighbourhood degree kc is the number of adjacent cells [21] or, which
is equal to that, the number of non-dead-end roads the cell is connected to. The
frequency distribution P (kc) of neighbourhood degrees for the road network
of Dresden is shown in Fig. 5(a). In all 20 road networks under consideration,
around 80% of the cells have three to six neighbours, where those with four
neighbours are always predominating. This is in perfect agreement with the
observations in non-planned settlements, while in crack patterns and maple
leaves the most frequent neighbourhood degree is always ﬁve, in dragonﬂy
wings and honey combs it is even six [19]. This leads to the conjecture, that
the most frequent neighbourhood degree of four is a distinctive feature of
urban road networks. The frequency density distribution p(Ac) of the surface
areas Ac is shown in Fig. 5(b). Note that we neglected cells of size smaller than
10, 000m2, which are usually artefacts of the data’s high precision, obviously
representing vacancies within more complicated intersection layouts. The dis-
tribution p(Ac) is scale invariant and obeys the power-law p(Ac) ∼ A−α
c with
the exponent α = 1.892 for the road network of Dresden, see Table 1.

Figure 6. Form factor φc of cells in (a) regular structures and (b) in the district
of Striesen in the road network of Dresden. (c) The frequency density distribution
p(φc) of the form factors has a standard deviation (small arrows) of sφ = 0.156
indicating a broad diversity of the cell shapes. The dotted line represents the mean
value ¯φc.

As a quantitative measure of the compactness or roundness of a cell c, we use
the form factor φc. It is the fraction of the surface area of the circumscribed
circle that is covered by the cell. With Dc denoting the maximum distance be-
tween two points on the boundary of the cell, the form factor can be estimated
by φc = 4/π (Ac/D2
c ). The values of φc range from 0 to 1 and correspond to
the limiting cases of inﬁnitely narrow and perfectly circular cells, respectively.
Fig. 6(a) gives an example of form factors in homogenous grid structures and
Fig. 6(b) shows a small part of the road network of Dresden. The frequency
density distribution p(φc) of form factors in the road network of Dresden is
shown in Fig. 5(c). The maximum value found is φc = 0.73, while 70% of
the cells have a form factor in the range between 0.3 and 0.6. The standard
deviation of sφ = 0.156, see Table 1, reﬂects a broad diversity of cell shapes.
This might result from the long history of German cities, that were growing
over several centuries and contain both, historic centres and modern regularly
structured areas designed according to today’s infrastructural demands.

5 Summary

We have analysed real-world data of urban road networks of the 20 largest
German cities. Considering travel-times rather than distances reveals an ef-
fective dimension signiﬁcantly larger than two. Centrality measures allow for
the quantiﬁcation of ‘important’ or frequently used road segments and reﬂect
the hierarchical structure of the road network. The shape of the cells encir-
cled by road segments can be quantiﬁed through the notion of a form factor.

9

We found scaling of several aspects of road networks, such as the distribution
of cell sizes or the number of nodes reachable within a travel-time budget.
In contrast to many material transport networks in biology such as vascular
[22], however, their topological organisation is less obvious and a hierarchical
structure similar to a Cayley tree is not found at all.

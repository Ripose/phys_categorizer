We consider the average probability X of being informed on a gossip in a given social network. The
network is modeled within the random graph theory of Erd˝os and R´enyi. In this theory, a network
is characterized by two parameters: the size N and the link probability p. Our experimental data
suggest three levels of social inclusion of friendship. The critical value pc, for which half of agents
are informed, scales with the system size as N −γ with γ ≈ 0.68. Computer simulations show that
the probability X varies with p as a sigmoidal curve. Inﬂuence of the correlations between neighbors
is also evaluated: with increasing clustering coeﬃcient C, X decreases.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Entering a new social group, we are vividly interested
in all kinds of non-formal contacts. They are necessary
to interpret and qualify properly all information we get:
as relevant or marginal, unique or commonly available,
urgent or not so, etc. We are taught by evolutionary
psychology [1] that this need reﬂects the way of work of
the human brain, as it has been formed during millions
of years of evolution. This need forms then our today’s
relations with people as well. As a consequence, it re-
mains relevant for any social theory of human relations.
That is why gossip appeared as an appealing catchword
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Because of its roots noted above, theory
of gossip can be seen as a part of evolutionary psychol-
ogy. Once an evolutionary sociology emerges [7], we will
certainly ﬁnd it there.

In sociophysics, we look at social sciences through a
mathematical glass. Being somewhat blind to hermeneu-
tical analyzes, we look for determinism, structure and
numbers. Such an attitude meets an old hope of sociol-
ogists to deal with problems as well-deﬁned and narrow
as physicists have. (Invocations to physics are quite fre-
quent in old sociological textbooks [9, 10], to call only few
examples.) Sociology can meet with sociophysics in all
cases where the structure of society is of importance. By
structure we mean a system of mutual or directed connec-
tions between people. In a reductionistic approach, such
a system can be represented by a graph, where people
are nodes and relations between people are links. Quite
naturally, such a picture is a favorite tool in sociophysics.
Here we are going to use this mathematical represen-

tation to analyze the spreading of gossip. The starting
point is the theory and experiment proposed and per-
formed recently by some of present authors [11]. Ac-
cording to this theory, “gossip is non-public information
about knowable people and its primary attribute is pro-
liferation. Gossiping is a communicative propensity char-
acteristic of the human race manifesting itself in smaller
communities”. Then, the person who is the subject of the
gossip is known personally to the community. This fact
makes the gossip interesting and this interest is the nec-
essary condition of the gossip spreading. This “semipri-
vate” character makes our case diﬀerent from the theory
of rumor by Galam [12]. The experiment [13] dealt with
an interest in gossip about a known or knowable person
in a web-based social network. As a result, three lev-
els of social inclusion have been found, which practically
limited the gossip spreading. As a sample of the ques-
tionnaire, answers were gathered to the following:

i) Would you tell about your girlfriend’s new job to

your friend?

ii) Would you tell about your girlfriend’s new job to

your friend’s girlfriend?

iii) Would you tell about your girlfriend’s new job to

your friend’s girlfriend’s colleague?

The percentage of positive answers varied from 100
through 74.8 till 22.1, respectively for questions i), ii)
and iii). After the third degree the results had shown a
sharp decline.

These considerations led us to our main question, un-
der what conditions a given gossip will be known in the
whole community? The above numbers (1.0, 0.748 and
0.221) served us as probabilities, that the gossip will be
told to people of 1-st, 2-nd and 3-rd level of inclusion,
deﬁned by the questionnaire. At this point we are faced
with the as-yet-unsolved problem, what is the structure

of the social network? We have to admit that the answer
varies from one kind of network to another, one or an-
other kind of social ties. In the literature of the subject,
one can ﬁnd arguments about diﬀerent parameters of so-
cial networks: size from a hundred to three hundreds and
more [2, 14, 15], clustering coeﬃcient [16], strength of ties
[17] and structure [18, 19]. The results can depend also
on whether complete networks or personal networks are
investigated [20]. When we speak on friendly personal
networks, the size of a typical group can decrease by at
least one order of magnitude [21]. Not entering these dis-
cussions, here we attack the problem of gossip spreading
in a model way, where the average number of friends is
a model parameter. Also, for simplicity we choose the
random graph of Erd˝os and R´enyi [22] as a model of a
social network. This selection should serve as a useful
point of reference.

The goal of this paper is to calculate the probability
that the gossip is known, averaged over the community
members. Basically, the result is close to zero or one,
except some range of the average number of friendship
ties. This range can be seen as the range of a transi-
tion between two phases: “they do not know” and “they
know”. However, even if the width of this range even-
tually shrinks to zero in the limit of large networks, this
limit is not relevant for social sciences, where the qual-
ity of useful approximations does not necessarily increase
with the system size.

In next section we describe the model calculations and

the results. Last section is devoted to conclusions.

II. CALCULATIONS AND RESULTS

From noted above, the following model assumptions

emerge:

1. The set of nodes are those who “know about”, and

that is why they are willing to hear.

2. The links join two nodes if they are friends.

3. The linkage is random, as in the Erd˝os–R´enyi

model.

4. The question is to evaluate the size of the group

who will know the information.

The detail is if the object of the gossip is also a member
of the network in which gossip is spread. The argument
for this assumption is in the questionnaire “about your
girlfriend’s new job”. In this case the talker role is to be
limited to the set of boyfriends of the girl. However, we
assume that the girl can have more boyfriends, and then
the number of talkers can be greater than one.

In this case we have two parameters: N (the number
of nodes) and p (the probability of a link of friendship
between randomly selected nodes). As we know from
the theory of random networks [25], the mean degree is
z = p(N − 1). The numbers (1.0, 0.748 and 0.221) can

be interpreted as weights in the average level of being
informed about a given gossip. All friends of the girl
who got a job will know it with probability one. This is
a contribution z. Their friends (each has z − 1 still not
informed) will know the gossip with probability 0.748.
This is a contribution 0.748z(z − 1). Finally, consider

information will pass to them from the teller with, say,
probability 0.221(z − 1)z(z − 1). Then, total level X of
being informed on the gossip would be

X =

z + 0.748z(z − 1) + 0.221z(z − 1)2
N

.

(1)

This is a function of N and p = z/(N − 1).
This expression has some deﬁciency:

in the random
networks the probability that two “friends” of a node are
also “friends” is z/(N − 1) = p. In the above calcula-
tion, we disregarded this possibility. Now we are going

with probability one. Each has (z − 1) neighbors, p of
them are already informed. Then, newly informed are
only (1 − p) next neighbors, and their contribution will
be 0.748z(z − 1)(1 − p). How many still non-informed
neighbors have these z(z − 1)(1 − p) people? The answer
is that each has (z − 1)(1 − p). They will be informed by
a teller with probability 0.221. Then, their contribution
is 0.221z(z − 1)2(1 − p)2. The total formula is:

X =

z + 0.748z(z − 1)(1 − p) + 0.221z(z − 1)2(1 − p)2
N

.

(2)
We note that still there are some assumptions left about
the lack of correlations of further order, the arguments
are somewhat heuristic, and valid only for small p. How-
ever, X obviously increases with p. In the range where
the formula is not valid (large p) we rely on a computer
simulation.
It appears (Fig. 1) that at some value of
p, almost everybody will know the gossip. This value of
p is however not strictly deﬁned and it depends on the
system size N . For small p, both expressions (Eqs. (1)
and (2)), for correlated and uncorrelated (i.e. random)
case, work almost equally well.

Motivated by tradition of statistical mechanics, we
made an attempt to evaluate the probability pc, where
X = 1/2. This pc can be seen as a critical value be-
tween the two phases remarked above, where “they do
not know” for p < pc and “they know” for p > pc. The
size dependence of pc, i.e. pc(N ), is shown in Fig. 2. The
results nicely ﬁt a power law pc ∝ N −γ. The exponent γ
slightly varies with the measured probabilities; it is 0.68
for the values of the probabilities (1.0, 0.748 and 0.221)
used here, but 0.63 for (1.0, 0.7 and 0.25), 0.65 for (1.0,
0.75 and 0.25) and 0.66 for (1.0, 0.8 and 0.2). At this
stage of calculations we are not in position to conclude if
any universality is hidden behind these numbers.

We made also an attempt to evaluate the inﬂuence of
the clustering coeﬃcient C on our results. The coeﬃcient

FIG. 1: Average probability X of being informed on a gos-
sip against (a) the probability p and (b) mean node degree
z. Theoretical curves (Eqs. (1) and (2)) diﬀer only slightly
for N = 100, but coincide for larger networks. Their accor-
dance with the simulation results improves for larger N , where
the correlations between informed neighbors can be neglected
with better accuracy.

C is deﬁned as the ratio of number of links between ki
nearest neighbors of i-th site, divided by the maximal
value of this number (ki(ki − 1)/2) and averaged over
all sites of the network with more than one neighbor.
Our motivation comes from the suggestion [26] that in
social systems, the correlation is larger than for random
case. The simulation is performed for N = 1000 and p =
0.0135, which is equal to pc(N = 1000) for the random
(i.e. uncorrelated) network. The clustering coeﬃcient
is increased by a rewiring procedure: a node is selected
with at least Kcut = 3 neighbors, and the link to one
of its neighbor is cut; instead, it is added between two
remaining neighbors.

The result is that as C increases, the average size X
of informed group decreases. Example of this result is

shown in Fig. 3.
It is clear that in the case of larger
C, information is transmitted more frequently within a
small group. On the contrary, its spread over the whole
community is less eﬀective. This eﬀect is parallel to the
discussion in sociological literature, where links joining
diﬀerent compact groups (the so-called weak ties) are
considered to be crucial for the information spreading
[17].

III. CONCLUSIONS

When a social group is formed from the beginning, al-
most nobody knows anything about others. Soon mutual
ties are built and strengthen, and information starts to
ﬂow. In our picture, this process can be interpreted as an

increasing of the probability p in time. The results pre-
sented in Fig. 1 indicate, that the information carried by
gossips increases initially with p as a low degree polyno-
mial. Gradually, the whole group becomes informed and
the information saturates.

known that large connected clusters appear for p > 1/N
[22, 25]. Important diﬀerence is that in our case of gossip,
we have one source of information. Once we allow for a
distribution of sources within the network, the problem of
gossip becomes alike to the family of problems, as boot-
strap percolation [27] or diﬀusion percolation [28, 29]. It
seems natural that these problems will ﬁnd social applica-
tions, similar to those [30] of standard percolation theory
[31]. The bottleneck here is the sociological experiment,

which is much more diﬃcult, costful and debatable than
computer simulations.

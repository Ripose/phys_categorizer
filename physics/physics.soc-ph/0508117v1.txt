In this paper the diﬀusion entropy technique is applied to investigate the scaling behavior of
ﬁnancial markets. The scaling behaviors of four representative stock markets, Dow Jones Industrial
Average, Standard&Poor 500, Heng Seng Index, and Shang Hai Stock Synthetic Index, are almost
the same; with the scale-invariance exponents all in the interval [0.92, 0.95]. These results provide a
strong evidence of the existence of long-rang correlation in ﬁnancial time series, thus several variance-
based methods are restricted for detecting the scale-invariance properties of ﬁnancial markets. In
addition, a parsimonious percolation model for stock markets is proposed, of which the scaling
behavior agrees with the real-life markets well.

INTRODUCTION

Analysis of ﬁnancial time series attracts special atten-
tions from diverse research ﬁelds for several decades. It
can not only reveal the intrinsic dynamical properties of
the corresponding ﬁnancial markets but also provide us
a clear scenario to construct dynamical models. Tradi-
tional theories are constructed based upon some basic
hypothesis, to cite examples, the stochastic processes in
the markets and the homogenous property of the mar-
kets, etc. The unexpected so-called rare events are ex-
plained simply as the results due to accidents or exter-
nal triggers[1]. The advancements in nonlinear theory
lead a complete revolutionary in our ideas about ﬁnancial
markets. Instead of the deduced Gaussian distribution,
empirical investigations in recent years indicate that the
price return distribution of the ﬁnancial time series gen-
erally obeys the centered L´evy distribution and displays
fat-tail property, and the ﬁnancial time series exhibits the
scale-invariance behavior [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. The nonlin-
ear theory based analysis and dynamical models for the
ﬁnancial markets are the essential problems at present
time.

One of the important features of the ﬁnancial time se-
ries is the scale-invariance property, which can highlight
the dynamical mechanics for the corresponding markets.
Consider a complex system containing a large amount of
particles. The scale-invariance property in the diﬀusion
process of this system can be described mathematically
with the probability distribution function as

P (x, t) =

1
tδ F (

x
tδ ),

(1)

∗Electronic address: zhutou@ustc.edu

where x is the displacements of the particles in the com-
plex system and δ the scale−invariance exponent. The
theoretical foundation of this property is the Central
Limit Theorem and the Generalized Central Limit The-
orem [8, 9]. For δ = 0.5, the diﬀusion process is the
standard diﬀusion and F (y) is the Gaussian function.
And δ 6= 0.5 exhibits the deviation of the dynamical
process from the normal stochastic one. For a ﬁnan-
cial time series, the delay−register vectors, denoted with
{yk, yk+1, · · ·, yk+m−1|k = 1, 2, 3, · · ·, N − m + 1}, can
be regarded as the trajectories of N − m + 1 particles
during the period of 0 to m. By this way we can map
a time series to a diﬀusion process, called overlapping
diﬀusion process in this paper. An alternative solution
is to separate the considered time series into many non-
overlapping segments and regard these segments as the
trajectories.

In literature, several variance-based methods are pro-
posed to detect the scale-invariance properties, such as
the probability moment method [10], the ﬂuctuation ap-
proach and the de-trended ﬂuctuation approach [11], etc.
But these variance-based methods have two basic short-
comings. One is that the scale-invariance property can
be detected but the value of the exponent cannot be ob-
tained correctly. The other is that for some processes, like
the L´evy ﬂight, the variance tends to inﬁnite and these
methods are unavailabel at all. Although the inﬁnite can
not be reached due to the ﬁnite records of empirical data,
clearly we can not obtain correct information about the
dynamics under these conditions. Hence, in this paper
we suggest the using of diﬀusion entropy (DE) technique
to detect the scaling behavior of ﬁnancial markets.

II. DIFFUSION ENTROPY TECHNIQUE AND
DATA ANALYSIS

To overcome the above shortcomings in the variance-
based methods, the authors in reference[12] designed the
diﬀusion entropy analysis (DEA). To keep our description
as self-contained as possible, we review the DEA method
brieﬂy.

Filter out the trends in the original time series. Adopt-
ing the traditional assumption generally used in the re-
search ﬁled of engineering, that a discrete time series vari-
able consists of a slowly varying part and a ﬂuctuation
part[13, 14], the index of a stock market reads,

k+t

Xj=k

+∞

Z

−∞

where ζj is the ﬂuctuation with zero mean and ﬁxed vari-
ance.

In the signal processing, the slow and regular variation
Sj is usually called signal, which contains the useful in-
formation. And the rapid erratic ﬂuctuation ζj is called
the noise, which is regarded as perturbations containing
only trivial information. In the DEA method, however,
the scale−invariance will be detected from this ﬂuctua-
tion part. The ”step smoothing”[13] procedure is em-
ployed to estimate the Sj part in our calculations, that
is, regard the average of the segments as the trends, re-
spectively. The ﬁnal time series is regarded as a steady
series, whose overlapping diﬀusion process reads,

xk(t) =

ζj, k = 1, 2, · · · , N − t + 1.

(3)

Consequently, the Shannon entropy can be deﬁned as,

S(t) = −

P (x, t) log10[P (x, t)]dx.

(4)

A simple algebraic leads to,

S(t) = A + δ log10(t),

(5)

where

A = −

F (y) log10[F (y)]dx, y =

(6)

x
tδ .

+∞

Z

−∞

The DEA method has been used to deal with many time
series in diﬀerent research ﬁelds, such as the solar in-
duced atmosphere temperature series[15], the intermit-
tency time series in ﬂuid turbulence[16], the spectra of
complex networks[17], and the output spike trains of
neurons[18].

In order to truly uncover the scaling behavior of ﬁ-
nancial market, we study both the domestic and over-
sea stock markets. The domestic consist of Shang Hai
Stock Synthetic Index (SS) with length N = 5412,
and Hang Seng Index (HSI) with length N = 191076,
while Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) with length

FIG. 1:
(Color online) DE results for four time series from
diﬀerent stock markets. The squares, circles, upward trian-
gles and downward triangles denote the results for HIS, SS,
S&P500 and DJIA, respectively. The corresponding scaling
exponents are δHSI = 0.944 ± 0.004, δSS = 0.923 ± 0.004,
δS&P 500 = 0.950 ± 0.005 and δDJ IA = 0.948 ± 0.005, The
solid line, whose slope is δf it = 0.945, is presented as ref-
erence. The occurrence of saturation regime caused by the
”Step smoothing” is t = 365. Consequently, the ﬁtting in-
terval should be in the range of t < T
In the ﬁtting
procedure is implemented in the interval of t ∈ [1, 100]

3 [13].

N = 29627 and Standard&Poor 500 (S&P500) with
length N = 5695 are constituted of the oversea.
In
Fig. 1, the DE technique is applied to analysis these
real ﬁnancial time series and we demonstrate the scaling
behavior of diﬀerent Indices are almost same,with the
scaling exponents all in the interval [0.92, 0.95]; as show-
ing below: δss = 0.923 ± 0.004, δHSI = 0.944 ± 0.004,
δDJIA = 0.948 ± 0.005, and δS&P 500 = 0.950 ± 0.005.
These results provide a strong evidence of the existence
of long-rang correlation in ﬁnancial time series, thus sev-
eral variance-based methods are restricted for detecting
the scale-invariance properties of ﬁnancial markets.

Herein it must be noted that the occurrence of satura-
tion regime caused by the ”Step smoothing” is t = 365.
Consequently, the ﬁtting interval must be only a lim-
ited range of times,t < T
3 [13], which we estimate to be
t ∈ [1, 100].

III. THE MODEL

There are many modelling methods to explain the ori-
gins of the observed nonlinear scaling behavior of mar-
ket price as emerging from simple behavioral rules of
a large number of heterogeneous market participants,
such as behavior-mind models[19, 20], dynamic-games
models[21, 22], cellular-automata models[23, 24], multi-
agent models[25, 26], and so on. Here in this paper,

we consider a stock market model based on percolation
theory[27]. Cont and Bouchaud[28] successfully applied
percolation theory to modelling the ﬁnancial market(CB
model), which is one of the simplest models able to ac-
count for the main stylized fact of ﬁnancial markets, e.g.
fat tails of the histogram of log-returns. Up to now,
the percolation theory is widely used in modelling stock
markets[29, 30, 31, 32].

Based on percolation theory, our model incorporates
the following components diﬀerent from the original CB
model: (1) The cluster, deﬁned as a set of interconnected
investors, grows in a self-organized process. (2) The ef-
fect of ”herd behavior” on the trade-volume is magniﬁed
step by step during the cluster’s self-organized accumu-
lating process rather than instantaneously formed like EZ
model and its variety[33, 34, 35, 36]. (3) Some encoun-
tering smaller clusters will form a bigger cluster through
cooperating or one defeating the rivals. (4) An inﬁnite
cluster maybe exist without the need to tune p to pc
and its trade activity inﬂuence price ﬂuctuation. (5)The
number of investors participating in trading will vary dy-
namically. Now let’s see the model.

A. Dynamic of investor groups

Initially, M investors randomly take up the sites of an
L ∗ L lattice. Then for each cluster, a strategy is given:
buying, selling, or sleeping, which are denoted by 1, -1
and 0 respectively. In reality, the circle of professionals
and colleagues to whom a trader is typically connected
evolves as a function of time: in some cases, traders are
following strong herding behavior and the eﬀective con-
nectivity parameter p is high; in other cases, investors are
more individualistic and smaller values of p seem more
reasonable. In order to take the complex dynamics of in-
teractions between traders into account, we assume that
it undergoes the following evolution repeatedly:

(1)Growth: most of investors would like to imitate
the strategies which have been adopted by many others,
which induces ”herd behavior” occurring. In this sense
the herd behavior is ampliﬁed. Specially, the aﬀection of
the herd behavior will be magniﬁed gradually with the
increase of the number of investors adopting this strat-
egy, i.e., with the growth of the clusters. During cluster’s
growth, a number of new investors will be attracted by it
and become its members. In other words, every cluster
will absorb new investors with the probability

Pd(τ ) = Pd(τ − 1) + k(NT − NT (τ − 1)),

(7)

where k is a kinetic coeﬃcient controlling the growth
speed and NT is a threshold parameter (It has been vali-
dated that the value of the parameters k and NT could be
any value. These two parameters have no eﬀects on the
self-organization process of the clusters[37]). NT (τ −1) is
the number of the agents along its boundary, deﬁned as
a set made up of agents which belong to a cluster and at
least border on a site which isn’t part of this cluster, at

3

the last time step τ − 1. The new participating investor
will take up the empty sites around the old clusters and
imitate the same strategy as that of it. The probabil-
ity Pd is obviously limited to the range [0,1] so that we
have to impose Pd = 0 and Pd = 1, if the recurrence
relationship Equ.7 gives values for Pd < 0 or Pd > 1.

(2) New cluster’s birth: some investors will randomly
and independently enter the market with the probability
Pn. These investors don’t belong to an arbitrary existing
cluster and will take up the empty sites.

(3) Cooperation: encountering clusters will operate
cooperation and conﬂiction between them. When their
strategies are same, they are thought to cluster together
to form a new group of inﬂuence. Or there would be con-
ﬂiction between them. The consequence of conﬂiction is
that losers would be annexed by the winner and that a
new and bigger cluster whose strategy inherent the win-
ner’s will be formed. The probability of cooperation or
conﬂiction is as follow, i.e., some a cluster will cooperate
with or defeat others with the probability

Pm(k) ∼ |sk
τ |,

(8)

where |sk

τ | is the size of k-th cluster at time τ .

(4) Metabolism:

in reality, no matter how huge has
the size of a group ever been it would collapse due to
diﬀerent inﬂuences such as government decision on war
and peace. Some new clusters will come into the world in
the wake of aging clusters’ death. The probability with
which an aging clusters will die is:

Po =

x + y
2L

,

(9)

where x and y is the width of this cluster occurring on
the lattice in the x and y direction. Equ.(4) indicates
that the probability with which a cluster disbands would
increase with the cluster growth. Once a spanning cluster
exists, it would surely die. When a cluster disbands, all
its members would leave the market and the sites where
the death cluster ever occupied will be taken up by new
investors with the probability Pn. Such occupied sites
form a few new clusters. Every new cluster would be
given a strategy randomly.

Although each cluster could trade with others at ev-
ery trading step, the evolution frequency of the network
topology should not be so often. Thus, we assume that
the network structure of the market composed by investor
groups would evolve every N trading steps. With the
evolution of this artiﬁcial stock market, the number of
investors participating in trading isn’t constant. The net-
work will take on diﬀerent structure; the aﬀection of the
herd behavior on the trade-volume is gradually magni-
ﬁed. Without any artiﬁcial adjustment of the connectiv-
ity probability p to pc, spanning cluster may exist, whose
activity would inﬂuence the price ﬂuctuation.

B. Trading rules

Each cluster trades with probability a (called activity);
if it trades, it gives equal probability to a buying or sell-
ing with demand proportional to the cluster size. The ex-
cess demand is then the diﬀerence between the sum of all
buying orders and selling orders received within one time
interval. The price changes from one time step to the
next by an amount proportional to the excess demand.
To explain the ”volatility”, Stauﬀer introduces the feed-
back mechanism between the diﬀerence of the “supply
and demand” and activity of the investors[29]. Whereas
in our model, the diﬀerence of the “supply and demand”
not only aﬀects the activity probability but also the prob-
ability with which the active clusters choose to buy or
sell. The probability a evolves following the Equ.(5):

a(t) = a(t − 1) + lr(t − 1) + α,

(10)

2 a(t)(1 − ps(t)) and 1

where r is the diﬀerence between the demand and sup-
ply, l denotes the sensitivity of a to r and α measures
the degree of impact of external information on the ac-
tivity. Each active cluster choose to buy or sell with
probabilities 1
2 a(t)ps(t) respectively.
For r > 0, ps(t) = 0.5 + d1r(t − 1), while for r < 0,
ps(t) = 0.5 + d2r(t − 1). According to Kahneman and
Tversky[38], it is asymmetry that agents make their de-
cisions when they are in face of gain or loss. When refer-
ring to gain, most of the agents are risk adverse. On the
contrary, they are risk preference. These determine the
parameters d1 and d2, representing the sensitivity of the
agent’s mentality to the price ﬂuctuations and diﬀering
from each other. In our model we assume d2 = 2d1. The
diﬀerence between the demand and supply is:
m

r(t) =

sign(sj

t )(|sj

t |)γ

(11)

Xj=1

where m is the total number of clusters occurring on the
market. γ measures the degree of impact of each cluster’s
trade-volume on the price, 0 < γ < 1 allowing for a
nonlinear dependence of the change of (the logarithm of
the) price as a function of the diﬀerence between supply
and demand[39]. So the evolution of the price is:

Pr(t) = Pr(t − 1) exp(λr(t))

(12)

C. Simulation

When proper initial condition and parameters have
been chosen, the artiﬁcial stock market can generate its
stock price.
In Fig. 2 we present a typical simulation
result about price time series generated by our model,
which is rather similar to the real-life index (inset). The
parameters used here are a(0) = 0.09, r(0) = 0.09,
pr(0) = 1, Pd(0) = 0.4, k = 0.0001, NT = 50, l = λ = 1
L2 ,
L = 100, d1 = 0.00005, γ = 0.78, Pn = 0.6, M = 100,
N = 50.

By numerical studies, we have demonstrated that this
model exhibits the stylish facts with the price returns
distribution is a L´evy distribution in the central part fol-
lowed by an approximately exponential truncation[40],
and displays power-law avalanche size distribution that
agrees with the real-life markets well[41].

In succession, we investigate the scaling behavior of the
stock price time series generated by the present model.
One can see clearly in Fig. 3, the scaling of this arti-
ﬁcial stock market is δmodel = 0.939 ± 0.003, which is
excellently agree with the real-life markets (see also the
empirical data of DJIA for comparison). This numeri-
cal results strongly suggest that the present model has

5

successfully reproduced some dynamical characters of re-
ality.

IV. CONCLUSION

In summary, by means of the DE method we inves-
tigate the scaling behavior embedded in the time series
of four typical ﬁnancial markets. The scale-invariance
exponents are almost the same, being in the interval of
[0.92, 0.95]. This large deviation from the Gaussian dis-
tribution reveals the strong correlations in the time se-
ries. The present empirical study of the scaling behavior
in real markets also provides a usable quantity to check
the reliability of artiﬁcial market model.

Consequently, we propose a parsimonious percolation
model for stock market. Proper initial condition and pa-
rameters can lead its stock price series being similar to
the real-life index. Especially, the scaling behavior de-
tected with the DE method agrees with the real-life ﬁ-
nancial markets very well.

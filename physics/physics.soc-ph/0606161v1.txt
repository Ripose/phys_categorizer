Abstract. – We investigate the correlation properties of transaction data from the New York
Stock Exchange. The trading activity fi(t) of each stock i displays a crossover from weaker to
stronger correlations at time scales 60 − 390 minutes. In both regimes, the Hurst exponent H
depends logarithmically on the liquidity of the stock, measured by the mean traded value per
minute. All multiscaling exponents τ (q) display a similar liquidity dependence, which clearly
indicates the lack of a universal form assumed by other studies. The origin of this behavior is
both the long memory in the frequency and the size of consecutive transactions.

Financial markets are self-adaptive complex systems and their understanding requires in-
terdisciplinary research, including the application of concepts and tools of statistical physics.
The success of modern statistical physics lies to a large extent in explaining phenomena from
phase transitions to far-from-equilibrium processes, where the two key concepts have been
scaling and universality. When applied to physical systems, both can rely on a solid founda-
tion: renormalization group theory. But how reliable can insights based on these principles
be, if we move on to social or economic systems? According to economists, ”physicists [simply]
suﬀer from the belief that there must be universal rules” [1].

The aim of present paper is to point out that the assumption of universality can lead
to false conclusions regarding stock market dynamics [2]. We use multifractal analysis – an
approach very commonly pursued in econophysics – to point out that the size of the company,
or more appropriately the liquidity of its stock, aﬀects the observed characteristics of how it
is traded on the market. This dependence is continuous, and therefore it means the absence
of universality classes in trading dynamics.

By means of multifractal analysis, we show that: (i) Trading activity records show a
crossover from weaker to stronger correlations around the time scale of 1 trading day. (ii)

The strength of correlations above the crossover depends logarithmically on the average trad-
ing activity of the stock. (iii) The whole family of τ (q) multiscaling exponents of trading
activity shows a similar variation. (iv) These eﬀects originate from an interplay between the
autocorrelations of the frequency and the size of consecutive transactions.

The dataset used in our study was taken from the NYSE TAQ database [3], and it contains

the records of all transactions of the New York Stock Exchange in the years 2000 − 2002.
Let us denote the total traded value of a stock i in the time window [t, t + ∆t] by f ∆t
(t).
This is calculated as a sum of the values of all transactions for the given stock during [t, t+∆t].
If N ∆t
(t) denotes the number of trades for the stock in the interval, and the value of the n-th
i
trade is Vi(n), then one can write this formally as

i

f ∆t
i

(t) =

Vi(n),

n
X
ti (n)∈[t,t+∆t]

(1)

where the sum runs for the N ∆t

i

(t) trades in the interval.

Though the returns are known to be only short time correlated, ﬁnancial data contain
diﬀerent kinds of long-range correlations, examples range from volatility to order ﬂow [4–6].
Records of traded value are no exception from this [7–9], and are most often characterized by
the Hurst exponent, or in general, by multifractal spectra [10, 11]. Multifractal models repre-
sent a dynamically developing approach in describing ﬁnancial processes both in conservative
ﬁnance and econophysics (for a review, see [12]).

Recent studies [7, 13] have shown that the standard deviation, and even higher moments
of f exist, thus it is possible, to deﬁne the q-th order partition function in the following way:

where h·i denotes time averaging. For any ﬁxed stock i, the formula deﬁnes a τi(q) set of
exponents, indexed by q, and determined by the slopes of eq. (2) on a log-log plot (1). These
are often written in the form τ (q) = qH(q), and H = H(2) is called the Hurst exponent, while
other H(q)’s are the generalized Hurst exponents. This family of exponents is closely related
to the correlation properties of the data. If H = 0.5, the data have no long range correlations,
while for H > 0.5 (H < 0.5) signals have persistent (antipersistent) long range correlations.
If H(q) ≡ H is independent of q, the signal is self-aﬃne, while nontrivial q-dependence gives
rise to multiscaling or multi-aﬃnity.

Here, we present an analysis of the σq

i (∆t) partition functions. We investigated the 2416
stocks which were continuously listed at NYSE during the years 2000 − 2002, and which had
an average turnover hf i (mean traded value per minute) of at least 100 USD/min. This
ensures that there are no extended periods where the stock is not traded at all, and thus f (t)
is well-deﬁned.

For the calculation of σq

i (∆t) we used Detrended Fluctuation Analysis [11]. This method
uses piecewise polynomial ﬁts to remove instationarities from the data, and often produces
good estimates for τ (q). We tested the robustness of our estimates to the order of this
detrending, and varied the order of the polynomials from 1 to 5, but the results did not
change signiﬁcantly.

Then, we divided the stocks into ﬁve groups with respect to hf i: those with 102 USD/min
≤ hf i < 103 USD/min, those with 103 USD/min ≤ hf i < 104 USD/min, . . . , and ﬁnally 106
USD/min ≤ hf i. Then, we averaged the σq
i (∆t) partition functions within each group (2). As
an example, the results for q = 2 are shown in ﬁg. 1(a).
(1)Note that throughout the paper we use 10-base logarithms.
(2)This averaging procedure decreases the noise present in the data, without aﬀecting our main conclusions.

Figure 1 – (a) The normalized partition function 1
2 log ∆t for the ﬁve groups of com-
panies. A horizontal line would mean the absence of autocorrelations in the data.
Instead, one
observes a crossover phenomenon in the regime ∆t = 60 − 390 mins. Below the crossover all groups
show weakly correlated behavior. Above the crossover (ﬂuctuations on daily and longer scales), the
strength of correlations, and thus the slope corresponding to H + − 0.5, increases with the liquidity
of the stock. Note: Fits are for the regimes below 60 min and above 1700 min. (b) The values of
the scaling exponents τ +(q), valid for time scales longer than a trading day, for the ﬁve groups of
companies. Companies with higher average traded value exhibit stronger correlations, and weaker
multiscaling than their smaller counterparts. Correspondingly, their τ +(q) is greater, and the shape
of the curve is closer to the linear relationship τ +(q) = q.

One ﬁnds that, regardless of group, the log σq(∆t) versus log ∆t plots are not straight
lines. Instead, one observes a crossover phenomenon (3) [7, 8]: There are two regimes of ∆t
for which diﬀerent τ (q)-s can be identiﬁed. For ∆t < 60 min, we are going to use the notation
τ −(q), while for ∆t > 390 min, τ +(q). One can deﬁne the related generalized Hurst exponents
as τ ±(q) = qH ±(q). Systematically, H +(q) > H −(q), which means that correlations become
stronger when window sizes are greater than 390 min.

Moreover, there is remarkable diﬀerence between groups when ∆t > 390 min. This means
that the correlations present in the day-to-day variations of trading activity systematically
depend on hf i, as seen from H +(q) values indicated in ﬁg. 1(a). More of this dependence can
be understood if one examines the scaling exponents for more powers of q. This was done by
ﬁrst evaluating the value of τ +
i (q) for the independent stocks, and then averaging that for the
elements within each group. The results are shown in ﬁg. 1(b). The plot implies, that more
liquid stocks (greater hf i) display stronger correlations than their less liquid (smaller hf i)
counterparts, for any order q > 0. This is realized in a way that the degree of multiscaling
decreases, and the scaling exponents tend to the fully correlated self-aﬃne behavior with the
limiting exponents τ +(q) = q, H +(q) = 1.

Also note that data were ﬁrst corrected by the well-known U-shape pattern of daily trading activity (see, e.g.,
ref. [14]), calculated independently for each group.
(3)The fact, that the properties of stock market time series are diﬀerent on time scales shorter than and longer
than 1 trading day, was pointed out by many sources. The most common examples is are the distribution of
returns and the autocorrelations of volatility [4, 5].

Figure 2 – (a) The values of the generalized Hurst exponents H +(q), valid for time scales longer
than a trading day, for the ﬁve groups of companies. The diﬀerence in the strength of correlations,
and thus H +(q), is present for all powers q. This implies, that such a dependence on liquidity is
present in both low and high trading activity periods. (b) The values of H +(q), from top to bottom
q = −1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The points represent the average value for one of the ﬁve groups of companies.
One can see, that H +(q) changes in an approximately logarithmic fashion with hf i. Note: Stocks
grouped by hf i, increasing from bottom to top, ranges given in USD/min.

Fig. 2(a) shows the corresponding values of H +(q). The diﬀerence in the H +(q)’s between
the groups is present throughout the whole range of q’s, not only for large q’s which are
sensitive to the high trading activity. This indicates that the higher level of correlations in
more liquid stocks cannot be exclusively attributed to periods of high trading activity. Instead,
it is a general phenomenon, that is present continuously (4).

Despite the presence of non-universality, and that τ (q) depends on the liquidity of the
stock, there is a clear systematic way how this dependence is. In ﬁg. 2(b), we plot vertical
”cuts” of ﬁg. 2(a). These show, that for a ﬁxed value of q, τ +(q) increases with hf i in an
approximately logarithmic way:

τ +(q; hf i) = C(q) + γ(q) log hf i ,

(3)

where γ(q) ≈ 0.04 − 0.06.

Our results imply that the trading of assets of companies with very diﬀerent size and
liquidity cannot be described in a universal manner (5). There have been studies pointing out
such asset-to-asset variations, and the key role of liquidity [16–19], however, they have been
consistently overlooked by some econophysics groups. There is a wide range of studies, that
calculate ensemble averages over a large number of stocks, irrespective of their liquidities. In
some cases universality seems indeed to hold, like for the normalized distribution of returns

(4)One may notice, that there is a strong deviation in the case of stock with low liqudity, and q < −1. The
origin of this artifact is a ﬁnite size eﬀect: The stocks are traded in lots of 100, and thus they cannot be traded
in values less than price×100. This minimum acts as a cutoﬀ in small ﬂuctuations, to which q < −1 moments
are very sensitive.
(5)A recent preprint [9] shows similar eﬀects with respect to the market where the stocks are traded. More
indications of similar behavior can be found in refs. [7, 15]

[20, 21]. However, in other cases, as we have just seen, it is misleading to calculate averages
for stocks with a wide range of liquidity as done in, e.g., refs. [22–25]. A ”typical” τ (q) or
multifractal spectrum of assets is not meaningful in the presence of this clear, systematic
dependence.

What aspect of the trading dynamics is the origin of this non-universality? As eq. (1)
suggests, the source of ﬂuctuations in f is the ﬂuctuation of N and V (see also ref. [26]). Thus,
it is very instructive to deﬁne the Hurst exponents of these two processes in analogy with eq.
(2). We restrict ourselves to the q = 2 moment. One can introduce the HN i Hurst exponent
of the time series N ∆t

The important point here is that the scaling variable is the N number of consecutive trades.
This is divided by the hNii mean number of trades per minute. This is crucial, because
the trading frequency of the stocks varies over many orders of magnitudes. Thus N trades
corresponds a diﬀerent time span depending on trading frequency, i.e., on the stock. The
scaling variable N/ hNii has a dimension of minutes (just like ∆t), and its ﬁxed value always
means the same time window size, regardless of the stock.

Moreover, when applying eq. (5), there is a natural lower limit in window size: one cannot
take less than one trade, and so N ≥ 1. Consequently, a group average for σ2
V i is undeﬁned,
where the scaling variable would be N/ hNii < 1/ hNii for any stock in the group (6). For
more liquid stocks, hNii is larger, thus the minimal window size is smaller.

The results are shown in ﬁg. 3(b). H

exists for all groups and follows the same trend of increasing correlations for greater liquidity.
The number of transactions in a given time window [t, t + ∆t] is – to a good approximation
– independent from the value of the single transactions (7). Under this condition, one can
show that for any stock i:

us assume, that the size of the transactions is constant, so Vi(n) = hVii, and σ2
Then, the second term is zero, and eq. (6) simpliﬁes to σ2

This is in agreement with the results summarized in table I. The table also shows that
above the crossover there are no major diﬀerences between H, HN and HV . This means that
neither of the two processes dominates in general.

We have studied the correlation functions (2), (4) and (5) found the following: (i) There
exists a crossover in the behavior as a function of the time window at ∆t ≈ 1 trading day;
(ii) There is non-universal (multi)scaling for large ∆t with a systematic dependence of the
exponents on the liquidity; (iii) Eq. (6) points out the interplay between the ﬂuctuations in the
number of trades and the tick-by-tick values, resulting in the observed long term correlations
for the activity. While we emphasize the non-universal character of the exponents, we also
mean to underline the systematic trends as a function of the company size (liquidity). These
properties of trading should be addressed by the future modeling eﬀorts of the stock market.

Summary. This paper is intended as an investigation of the statistical properties
of absolute log-returns, deﬁned as the absolute value of the logarithmic price change,
for the Nikkei 225 index in the 28-year period from January 4, 1975 to December
30, 2002. We divided the time series of the Nikkei 225 index into two periods,
an inﬂationary period and a deﬂationary period. We have previously [18] found
that the distribution of absolute log-returns can be approximated by the power-law
distribution in the inﬂationary period, while the distribution of absolute log-returns
is well described by the exponential distribution in the deﬂationary period.

To further explore these empirical ﬁndings, we have introduced a model of stock
markets which was proposed in [19,20]. In this model, the stock market is com-
posed of two groups of traders: the fundamentalists, who believe that the asset price
will return to the fundamental price, and the interacting traders, who can be noise
traders. We show through numerical simulation of the model that when the number
of interacting traders is greater than the number of fundamentalists, the power-law
distribution of absolute log-returns is generated by the interacting traders’ herd
behavior, and, inversely, when the number of fundamentalists is greater than the
number of interacting traders, the exponential distribution of absolute log-returns
is generated.

Key words: absolute log-returns; exponential laws; power laws; inﬂa-
tion; deﬂation; a stochastic model of stock markets; heterogeneous agents.

1 Introduction

Over the past few decades a considerable number of studies have been made of
distributions of ﬁnancial data. In the early studies, studies of daily ﬂuctuations
of commodity prices led Mandelbrot [1] and Fama [2] to propose that the
associated distribution function is a power-law distribution with an exponent
close to 1.7. More recently, some researchers have quantitatively reinvestigated

2

T. Kaizoji

the tick-by-tick data set of stock prices, which includes approximately 40
million records, and found that the probability distribution of log-returns and
volatility satisﬁes a power law with an exponent close to 3 [3-6]. Theorists
also use various versions of multiplicative random processes in the theoretical
modeling of returns and volatility. An important goal of these market models
is to explain the main stylized facts such as power laws observed in ﬁnancial
markets [7-17].

In this present study, we ﬁrst examined the statistical properties of abso-
lute log-returns, deﬁned as the absolute value of the logarithmic price change,
for the Nikkei 225 index. We divided the time series of the index into two pe-
riods, an inﬂationary period and a deﬂationary period. Using this division, we
found that the distribution of the absolute log-returns can be approximated
by the power-law distribution in the inﬂationary period, while the distribution
of absolute log-returns is well-described by the exponential distribution in the
deﬂationary period1.

We then performed numerical simulations of the model of stock markets
proposed in our previous works [19,20] in order to provide an explanation of
the empirical ﬁndings. In our model, the stock market is composed of two
typical groups of traders: the fundamentalists who believe that the asset price
will return to the fundamental price, and the interacting traders who tend to
be inﬂuenced by the investment attitudes of other traders. We show that our
model can reproduce the above-mentioned statistical properties of absolute
log-returns. In particular, we show the following:

• When (i) the number of interacting traders is greater than the number
of fundamentalists, and (ii) the interaction among interacting traders is
strong, a power-law distribution of absolute log-returns is generated.
Inversely, when (i) the number of fundamentalists is greater than the
number of interacting traders, and (ii) the interaction among interact-
ing traders is weak, the exponential distribution of absolute log-returns is
generated.

•

Thus the numerical simulation helps account for the empirical ﬁndings.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: the next section reviews
brieﬂy the empirical ﬁndings. Section 3 describes the stochastic model, sec-
tion 4 provides the results of the numerical simulation, and section 5 gives
concluding remarks.

2 The Empirical Results [18]

In this section we discuss the statistical properties of the absolute log-returns
for the Nikkei 225 index in the 28-year period from January 4, 1975 to De-
cember 30, 2002. Figure 1(a) shows the time series of the Nikkei 225 index

We have previously reported these empirical ﬁndings [18] and analyzed the results
from a slightly diﬀerent perspective.

throughout the entire period. The Nikkei 225 index reached a high of almost
40,000 yen on the last trading day of the decade of the 1980s. However, the
index had declined to 14,309 yen, a drop of approximately 63 percent by mid-
August 1992. It follows from the ﬁgure that we can divide the time series of
the Nikkei 225 index into two periods, an inﬂationary period from January 4,
1975 to December 29, 1989, and a deﬂationary period from January 4, 1990
to December 29, 2002. We deﬁne the return Rj as the change in the logarithm
of the index Rj = lnSj − lnSj−1, where Sj denotes the index at data j. The
term volatility represents a generic measure of the magnitude of market ﬂuc-
tuations. Thus, many diﬀerent quantitative deﬁnitions of volatility are used
in the literature. In this study, we deﬁne the volatility as the absolute value
of the return, Vj = |Rj|. Figure 1(b) shows the time series of the absolute
log-return Vj of the Nikkei 225 index.

Figure 2(a) and 2(b) show the semi-log plots of the complementary cumu-
lative distribution function of the absolute log-returns for the Nikkei 225 index
in the inﬂationary and deﬂationary periods, respectively. We found that the
complementary cumulative distribution function of the absolute log-returns
for the deﬂationary period is accurately described by an exponential distribu-
tion P (V ≥ x) ∼ exp(−x/β) in the whole range of the absolute log-returns Vj .
We estimate the parameter β using the least-square method, and we estimate,

β = 0.68, R2 = 0.996,

p-value = (0.0).

In contrast, the other hand the complementary cumulative distribution func-
tion of the absolute log-returns for the inﬂationary period ﬁts the exponential
law for low values of x, and it deviates from the exponential distribution as
the absolute log-return increases. Figure 3 shows the log-log plot of the com-
plementary cumulative distribution function of the absolute log-returns in the
inﬂationary period. It is apparent that this plot tends to a linear function for
high values of x, indicating that the complementary cumulative distribution
function of the absolute log-returns is consistent with power law asymptotic
behavior P (V ≥ x) ∼ x−α. The value of α estimated by the least squared
method in [1.1 ≤ x ≤ 8],

α = 3.38, R2 = 0.991,

p-value = (0.0).

In summary, we ﬁnd that the distribution of absolute log-returns for stock
price indices can be approximated by the power-law distribution in the inﬂa-
tionary period, while the distribution is accurately described by the exponen-
tial distribution in the deﬂationary period.

Why are empirically diﬀerent laws observed? To answer this question, we

propose a stochastic model in the following section.

3 A Stochastic Model of Stock Markets [19,20]

Let us consider a stock market where a stock is traded at price Sj. Two
groups of traders with diﬀerent trading strategies, interacting traders and,

4

T. Kaizoji

fundamentalists participate in the trading. The number of fundamentalists
m and the number of interacting traders n are assumed to be constant. The
model is designed to describe the movements of the stock price over short
periods, such as one day. In the following, a more precise account of the
decision-making of each trader type is given.

3.1 Interacting traders

During each time period, an interacting trader may choose to either buy or
sell the index, and is assumed to trade a ﬁxed amount of the index b in a
period of trading. Interacting traders are labeled by an integer 1 ≤ i ≤ n. The
investment attitude of the interacting trader i is represented by the random
variable ui and is deﬁned as follows: If interacting trader i is a buyer of the
index during a given period, then ui = +1, otherwise he sells the index, and
ui = −1. Now let us formulate the dynamics of the investment attitude of
interacting traders. Consider that the investment attitude ui of interacting
trader i is updated with transition probabilities as a function of the average
investment attitude over interacting traders X according to W↑(X) = 1/(1 +
exp(−2φX)) (transition from seller to buyer) and W↓(X) = 1/(1 + exp(2φX))
n
i=1 ui/n and φ denotes the
(transition from buyer to seller), where X =
interaction strengths among traders. Using the above transition probabilities,
the Ito stochastic diﬀerential equation for the average investment attitude X
is obtained as

P

dX(t) = K(X)dt +

Q(X)dW (t),

(1)

K(X) = tanh(φX), Q(X) =

(1 − tanh(φX))

p

2
n

where W (t) is the Wiener process. To perform the numerical simulation, we
consider a discretized version of the stochastic diﬀerential equation,

Xj+1 = Xj + K(Xj)∆tj + qQ(Xj)∆Wj.

(2)

Here, Xj = X(tj), ∆tj = tj+1 − tj and ∆Wj = W (tj+1) − W (tj). ∆Wj is the
increment of the Wiener process or a white noise.

We next assume that the interacting-traders’ excess demand for the in-
dex is approximated as QI
j = b n Xj. Following [17], we assume that the
interaction strengths change randomly in time j, and furthermore, deﬁne the
randomness as φj = ρ∆Wj, where the parameter ρ is a constant, and ∆Wj is
the increment of the Wiener process.

3.2 Fundamentalists

Fundamentalists are assumed to have a reasonable knowledge of the funda-
mental value of the index S∗
j . If the price Sj is below the fundamental value
S∗
j , a fundamentalist tends to buy the index (as he estimates the index to be

Absolute log-returns and a stochastic model of stock markets

5

undervalued), and if the price is above the fundamental value, a fundamen-
talist tends to sell the index. Hence we assume that fundamentalists’ buying
or selling order is given by Qf
ln S∗
, where m is the number
(cid:1)
(cid:0)
of fundamentalists, and a parametrizes the strength of the reaction on the
discrepancy between the fundamental price and the market price.

j − ln Sj

j = a m

3.3 Market price

Let us leave the traders’ decision-making processes and turn to the deter-
mination of the market price. We assume the existence of a market clearing
system. In the system, a market maker mediates the trading and adjusts the
market price to the market clearing values. The market transaction is exe-
cuted when the buying orders are equal to the selling orders. The balance of
demand and supply is written as Qf
ln S∗
j + QI
+ b n Xj = 0.
j − ln Sj
j +λXj where λ = b n
The market price is therefore calculated as ln Sj = ln S∗
a m .
Using the price equation, we can categorize the market situations as follows:
If Xj = 0, the market price Sj is equal to the fundamental price S∗
j . If Xj > 0,
the market price Sj exceeds the fundamental price S∗
j (bull market regime).
If Xj < 0, the market price Sj is less than the fundamental price S∗
j (bear
market regime). Using the price equation, the log-return is deﬁned as

j = a m

(cid:3)

(cid:2)

Rj = ln Sj − ln Sj−1 = (ln S∗

j − ln S∗

j−1) + λ(Xj − Xj−1).

(3)

For simplicity of analysis we here assume that the fundamental price S∗
mains constant.

4 Simulations

We are interested in the statistical properties of time series generated by our
model and how they compare with those of real data shown in Section 2.
In this section we perform numerical simulation of the model introduced in
Section 3.

To this end, we consider two cases with diﬀerent sets of parameters:

1. Case I: n = 100000; m = 10000; a = b = 1; λ = 10; ρ = 5; ∆tj = 0.1.
2. Case II: n = 1000; m = 10000; a = b = 1; λ = 0.1; ρ = 2; ∆tj = 0.1.

Case I describes the situation of the stock market in the inﬂationary period.
Namely, Case I assumes that (i) a large number of traders participate in
trade, and (ii) the number of interacting traders is greater than the number
of fundamentalists, and (iii) the interaction among the interacting traders is
strong. In contrast, Case II describes the situation of the stock market in
the deﬂationary period. Case II assumes that (i) a small number of traders
participates in trade, and (ii) the number of interacting traders is less than

6

T. Kaizoji

the number of fundamentalists, and (iii) the interaction among the interacting
traders is weak2.

Figure 4(a) displays a typical time series of the absolute log-returns gen-
erated numerically from the model with Case I. Figure 4(b) shows the com-
plementary cumulative distribution function in log-log scale, calculated from
the model series of the absolute log-returns in Fig. 4(a). The ﬁgure shows
that the complementary cumulative distribution function of the absolute log-
returns is approximated by the power-law distribution P (V ≥ x) ∼ x−αwith
the exponent α equal to 1.7.

We next perform the numerical simulation of the model with Case II.
Figure 5(a) shows a typical time series of the absolute log-returns generated
from the model with Case II. Figure 5(b) indicates the semi-log plot of the
complementary cumulative distribution function of the absolute log-returns
calculated using the model series of the absolute log-returns in Fig. 5(a). The
ﬁgure shows that the complementary cumulative distribution function of the
absolute log-returns is accurately described by the exponential distribution
P (V ≥ x) ∼ exp(x/β). The estimated parameter β is equal to 0.7.

5 Concluding remarks

In this paper we ﬁrst showed the statistical properties of the Nikkei 225 index,
that is, (i) in periods of inﬂation the complementary cumulative distribution
function of the absolute log-returns is approximated by the power-law dis-
tribution, and (ii) in periods of deﬂation the complementary cumulative dis-
tribution function of the absolute log-returns is accurately described by the
exponential distribution.

We next introduced a stochastically macroscopic model of stock markets to
explain these empirical ﬁndings. In our model, the stock market is composed
of two groups of traders: the fundamentalists and the interacting traders.
The results of the numerical simulation suggest the following: in the period
of inﬂation, the number of interacting traders strongly inﬂuenced by the in-
vestment attitudes of others is greater than the number of fundamentalists,
who believe that the asset price will return to the fundamental price, so that
power-law distribution of the absolute log-returns is generated by interacting
traders’ herd behavior. On the other hand, we can deduce that in the period
of deﬂation a number of interacting traders leave the stock markets, and fur-
thermore the interaction among the interacting traders is weak, while most of
fundamentalists stay in the market; as such, the exponential law of absolute
log-returns is observed.

As a consequence, the model captures the two opposing empirical data
sets observed in real ﬁnancial markets, and provides a reasonable explanation

simulations of this model, see [20].

of the empirical ﬁndings we presented in section 2. Although the model is
simple, it may thus be seen as a reasonable approximation of the absolute
log-returns in real stock markets.

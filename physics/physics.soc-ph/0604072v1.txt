Traﬃc congestion is usually observed at the upper streams of bottlenecks like tunnels.

Congestion appears as stop-and-go waves and high density uniform ﬂow. We perform simu-

lations of traﬃc ﬂow with a bottleneck using the coupled map optimal velocity model. The

bottleneck is expressed as a road segment with speed reduction. The emergence of stop-and-

go waves depends on the speed reduction in the bottleneck. A phenomenological theory of

bottleneck eﬀects is constructed.

1.

Introduction

Traﬃc ﬂow phenomena have been attracting scientiﬁc and engineering research interests

since the popularization of cars in 1950s. Physical understanding of the traﬃc ﬂow in ex-

pressways has been improved mainly on the basis of mathematical models and their computer
simulations since the early 1990s.1, 2) Many interesting features have been studied from the

viewpoints of nonequilibrium statistical physics, pattern formation and transportation phe-

nomena.

One of interesting features observed in traﬃc ﬂow is the emergence of traﬃc congestion.

Traﬃc congestion is usually observed at the upper stream of bottlenecks like tunnels. It
appears as stop-and-go waves and complex ﬂow called synchronized ﬂow.3) It is pointed out,
however, that a bottleneck is not the origin of congestion.4, 5) A bottleneck just increases the

density of traﬃc ﬂow. The high density traﬃc ﬂow is unstable and breaks down to congested

ﬂow. So the purpose of this paper is to observe the formation of congestion at the upper

streams of bottlenecks with simulations and to discuss the eﬀects of bottlenecks.

Physical models of traﬃc ﬂow are, in general, divided into two types, macroscopic and

microscopic. The macroscopic models treat traﬃc ﬂow as ﬂuid. The microscopic models treat

individual cars as particles and describe the interactions among them. One of the microscopic
traﬃc ﬂow models is the Nagel-Schreckenberg traﬃc ﬂow model,6) which is a cellular automa-

ton model of traﬃc ﬂow. Another type of the microscopic traﬃc ﬂow models is the type of
car-following models.1)

The optimal velocity (OV) model7) of traﬃc ﬂow is one of the car-following models. The

most important feature of the model is the introduction of the optimal velocity. In the OV

model, each car controls its speed to ﬁt the optimal velocity, which is decided by the headway

distance to its preceding car. The model is described as a set of diﬀerential equations for the

positions of cars. The model is suitable to treat the instability of the high density traﬃc ﬂow
at the upper stream of a bottleneck like tunnels.4)

We construct a simulation system for observing the emergence of congestion near a bot-

tleneck. The system should be an open-road system with injection and ejection of cars. So we
employ the Coupled Map Optimal Velocity (CMOV) model of traﬃc ﬂow,8) which is a tem-

poral discretization of the OV model. The CMOV model is suitable for computer simulations

with open boundaries.

The organization of this paper is as follows: First we describe the CMOV model and the

setup of the simulations in §2. We construct a one-lane open-road system with a bottleneck.

The bottleneck is implemented as a road segment with speed reduction. The simulation results

are shown in §3. Typically we observe stop-and-go waves at the distant upper stream of the

bottleneck. Near the bottleneck, there is a uniform-density traﬃc ﬂow. We summarize the

relation of the speed reduction in the bottleneck to the appearance of the stop-and-go waves.

A phenomenological theory of bottleneck eﬀects is discussed in §4. Section 5 is devoted to

summary and discussion.

2. Model and Simulation Setup

We employ the Coupled Map Optimal Velocity (CMOV) traﬃc ﬂow model,8) which is a
temporal discretization of the Optimal Velocity (OV) model.7) The CMOV model updates

the position x(t) and the speed v(t) of a car by

x(t + ∆t) = x(t) + v(t)∆t,

v (t + ∆t) = v(t) + α (Voptimal (∆x) − v(t)) ∆t,

where ∆x is the headway distance to the preceding car, ∆t is a discrete-time unit given as

0.1(sec) in this paper, and α is a sensitivity constant. Each car controls its speed to ﬁt the

optimal velocity decided by the OV function Voptimal(∆x), which depends on the headway

distance ∆x to the preceding car. The OV function is, in general, a sigmoidal function of the

headway distance. For realistic simulations, we use the following form:

Voptimal (∆x) =

vmax

∆x − d

tanh

+ c

,

(cid:21)

where parameters vmax, d, w and c can be obtained through observations of the car-following

behavior. We use the set of the parameters in Table I, which is compatible with that in Ref.[9].

Cars should stop to avoid backward motion and collision with preceding cars. The optimal

velocity is negative if the headway ∆x is less than ∆xmin which satisﬁes Voptimal(∆xmin) = 0.

Fig. 1. Schematic view of the system. Cars are injected from the left side and ejected away from

the right side. A bottleneck region is located at the right end of the system. In our simulations,

the length of the system and that of bottleneck region are L = 10000(m) and LB = 2000(m),

respectively.

The avoidance is expressed as replacing eqs.(1) and (2) with

x(t + ∆t) = x(t),

v(t + ∆t) = 0,

for ∆x < ∆xmin.

We construct a one-lane road of length L with open boundaries (Fig. 1). If a car arrived

at the right end of the system, it is ejected from the system. At the left end of the system a

car is injected if the distance between the left end of the system and the tail of the sequence

of cars is larger than ∆xmin.

We also introduce a bottleneck region of length LB at the right end of the system, for

observing its eﬀect. The bottleneck is deﬁned by reducing the maximum speed in the region.
Namely, cars in the bottleneck run with the reduced OV function V (b)

optimal:

V (b)
optimal (∆x) = rVoptimal (∆x) ,

(6)

where r (0 ≤ r ≤ 1) is the degree of speed reduction in the bottleneck.

3. Simulation Results

We performed simulations with L = 10000(m) and LB = 2000(m). After relaxation,

we can see typical car trajectories in the space-time plane (Fig.2). A high density uniform

region stably exists just before the bottleneck and maintains its length. The striped patterns

correspond to the stop-and-go waves. They propagate upstream (opposite to the car ﬂow).

No traﬃc jam emerges in the bottleneck.

Fig. 2. The space-time plot of car trajectories with the intermediate speed reduction r = 0.6. The

horizontal axis denotes the positions of cars. The vertical axis denotes the time.

As shown in Fig.3, the bottleneck induces three typical patterns of the traﬃc ﬂow. The

emergence of the stop-and-go waves depends on the density of cars just before entering the
bottleneck. We can analytically discuss the linear stability of uniform ﬂow by the OV model.4)

The hatched areas in Fig.3 show the density ρ = 1/∆x with which uniform ﬂow is linearly
unstable (V ′

optimal(1/ρ) > α/2).4)

After relaxation for 2 hours (72000 time steps), we calculate the average of the density at

the 7800m point by observing the ﬂux and the average of the velocity per hour (36000 time

steps) for each r value. The dependence of the averaged density ρH on the speed reduction

r is shown in Fig.4. We deﬁne rL and rU as the lower and upper bounds, between which

the density ρH remains in the hatched region. The boundary values rL and rU of the speed

reduction are obtained as approximately 0.44 and 0.92 respectively by the simulations.

A test car is injected from the left end of the system for observing its behavior during the

approach to the bottleneck. Its typical trajectory in the headway-velocity plane is shown in

Fig.5 for the intermediate speed reduction (rL < r < rU). First the trajectory draws a closed
loop called the hysteresis loop while the car continues the stop-and-go motion. As the car

approaches the uniform ﬂow region before the bottleneck, the loop converges to a point on

the curve of the OV function. Namely the car runs with the optimal velocity given by the OV

function. After the car enters the bottleneck, the trajectory moves to a point on the curve of

the reduced OV function in the bottleneck. As the car approaches the right end of the system

(the end of the bottleneck), the uniformity of the headway in the bottleneck is lost(this part

of the trajectory is not shown in Fig.5).

The relation between the speed reduction r and the density ρB in the bottleneck is shown

in Fig.6. The density ρB is observed at the 9000m point by the same method as the density ρH.

Except the very weak speed-reduction (r > rU), the density ρB is independent of the speed-

reduction r. We interpret these observed results in the density-ﬂow relation. We can calculate

the ﬂux q of the uniform ﬂow with the optimal velocity in the bottleneck as a function of the

4. Phenomenological theory of the bottleneck eﬀect

We are interested in the eﬀect of a bottleneck on the traﬃc ﬂow at the upper stream of the

bottleneck. Here we construct a phenomenological theory of the bottleneck eﬀect. We make

two assumptions based on our simulations. The ﬁrst one is that a uniform density ﬂow exists

§4. The speed reduction between rL ≃ 0.44 and rU ≃ 0.92 induces the density within the hatched

region.

just before the bottleneck. Thus cars run with the optimal velocity just before entering the

bottleneck. So the ﬂow qIN entering the bottleneck is given by a function of ρH:

qIN(ρH) = ρHVoptimal (cid:18)

1
ρH (cid:19)

,

where ρH is the density of cars just before the bottleneck (Fig.8).

Second, after entering the bottleneck the density ρB inside the bottleneck is tuned to

give the maximum ﬂow: The ﬂow qOUT in the bottleneck is given as a function of the speed

reduction r by

qOUT(r) = ρBV (b)

The conservation law of ﬂow requires that the ﬂow qIN entering the bottleneck is equal to

the qOUT in the bottleneck:

By this equation we obtain the density ρH just before the bottleneck as a function of the speed

The eﬀect of the bottleneck is shown as the curve in Fig.4 by solving eq.(11) numerically.

The curve well describes the simulation results except the very weak speed reduction r >
rU ≃ 0.92. We obtain two boundary values r′
U ≃ 0.989 of the speed reduction.
The intermediate speed reduction, r′
U, induces the car density with which uniform
ﬂow is linearly unstable (the hatched area in Fig.4). Thus the stop-and-go waves emerge at

L ≃ 0.441 and r′

L < r < r′

the distant upper stream of the bottleneck. We can predict the occurrence of the stop-and-go

waves by the value of r.

The numerical value r′

L of the lower bound agrees well with the simulation value rL. On
the other hand, the upper bound r′
U disagrees with the simulation value rU. The weak speed
reduction r > rU can not induce the maximum ﬂow in the bottleneck. The reason is that the

injected ﬂow from the left side of the system does not correspond to the maximum ﬂow. So

the speed reduction is not strong enough to form the maximum ﬂow in the bottleneck. As a

result, one of the assumptions in the phenomenological theory is not valid for the weak speed

reduction r > rU.

5. Summary and Discussion

We studied the eﬀect of a bottleneck by simulations. We employed the coupled map optimal

velocity (CMOV) model for our simulations. The bottleneck is deﬁned as a road segment with

speed reduction. We obtained the relation between the speed reduction r and the car density

ρH before the bottleneck: The very weak speed reduction, r > rU ≃ 0.92, does not increase
the car density and does not form the stop-and-go waves (Fig.3(a)). The very strong speed

reduction, r < rL ≃ 0.44, increases the density, which is high enough to stabilize the uniform
ﬂow (Fig.3(c)). The bottleneck with the intermediate speed reduction level, rL < r < rU,

induces the high density uniform ﬂow just before the bottleneck (Fig.3(b)). The uniform ﬂow

is linearly unstable and changes to the stop-and-go waves at the distant upper stream of the

bottleneck.

For the intermediate speed reduction, we ﬁnd two important features. The ﬁrst is that cars

run with the optimal velocity just before the bottleneck. The second is that the bottleneck

induces the maximal ﬂow within the bottleneck itself.

We employ these two features as assumptions for the phenomenological theory of the

bottleneck eﬀect. By the conservation law of ﬂow we obtain the density just before the bot-

tleneck as a function of the speed reduction. If the density corresponds to that of the linearly

unstable uniform ﬂow, the stop-and-go waves emerge at the distant upper stream of the bot-

speed reduction.

The boundary values rL and rU are deﬁned corresponding to those of the density just

before the bottleneck, within which the uniform traﬃc ﬂow is linearly unstable based on

the OV model. These values, however, are slightly diﬀerent from the boundary values of

the emergence of the start-and-stop waves in the simulations. The diﬀerence between these

boundary values seems to come from the diﬀerence between the CMOV and the OV models.

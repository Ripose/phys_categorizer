Abstract. We present an experimental and simulated model of a multi-agent stock market driven by a dou-

ble auction order matching mechanism. Studying the eﬀect of cumulative information on the performance

of traders, we ﬁnd a non monotonic relationship of net returns of traders as a function of information

levels, both in the experiments and in the simulations. Particularly, averagely informed traders perform

worse than the non informed and only traders with high levels of information (insiders) are able to beat

the market. The simulations and the experiments reproduce many stylized facts of stock markets, such as

fast decay of autocorrelation of returns, volatility clustering and fat-tailed distribution of returns. These

results have an important message for everyday life. They can give a possible explanation why, on average,

professional fund managers perform worse than the market index.

therefore dynamic. It thereby overcomes one of the ma-

topic (e.g. Refs. [5,6,7,8]). This is critical to go beyond

the straightforward (and not surprising) result that insid-

The experiments were based on a cumulative information

system. Nine traders with diﬀerent forecasting abilities

were trading on a continuous double auction with limit

orders and market orders. On the market a risky asset

(stock) and a risk free bond (cash) were traded. Any time,

traders could enter a new limit order to the book or ac-

cept someone’s limit order (realising a market order) with

all trades ﬁxed to unit volume. Each trader had a starting

endowment of 1600 units in cash and 40 shares of stock

of traders we ran the Wilcoxon rank sum test for equal

medians [13,14], on the relative performance for pairs of

information levels. The p–values of the tests can be found

in Table 1. Though in many of the cases the result of the

test does not exclude the hypothesis of the returns being

drawn from the same population, one can see that only

the very well informed traders (I8 and I9 ) perform sig-

niﬁcantly better than I3 and I5 on the 0.05 signiﬁcance

level, and the averagely informed (I5 ) underperform the

least informed (I1 ) at the 0.1 signiﬁcance level.

A tool for corroborating the relevance of results in ar-

tiﬁcial markets to the real-world is analysing from the

point of view of some of the well known empirical styl-

ized facts of markets [11]. While not getting stylized facts

3.1 The market mechanism

In our simulation we programmed an essential double auc-

tion trading mechanism as it appears on most of real world

ﬁnancial markets, with a book containing the bid and ask

orders. Since, in contrary to real world experiments, in

a numerical simulation one has the possibility to analyse

truly random traders, we implemented ten agents with dif-

ferent levels of information going from zero–information

(random traders), I0 to I9, and with the possibility of

using diﬀerent trading strategies as will be discussed in

each period new information was delivered to the agents

according to their information level as we will discuss in

Section 3.2. At the end of each period a risk free interest

rate was paid on the cash held by the agents, dividends

were paid on the shares held by the agents (the risk free

interest rate was rf = 0.001, the risk adjusted interest

rate re = 0.005) and the book was cleared. We also car-

ried out simulations without clearing the book and found

that the clearing process does not make much diﬀerence

in the results.

The dividend process (being the source of future infor-

mation) was determined before the beginning of the trad-

ing and was held ﬁxed throughout the diﬀerent runs of

the simulation. Similarly to the experiments, the dividend

process was a random walk of Gaussian steps:

I1 to I9, where agent Ij has information of the dividends

for the end of the current period and of (j −1) forthcoming

periods (forecasting ability). The information received by

traders was the present value of the stock conditional on

the basis of their forecasting ability. This was determined

by Gordon’s formula (Eq. 2).

Fundamentalist traders strictly believe in the information

they receive. If they ﬁnd an ask order with a price lower

or a bid order with a price higher than their estimated

present value, i.e. E(V |Ij,k), they accept the limit order,

otherwise they put a new limit order between the former

best bid and best ask prices.

Since we do not have exact information on how traders

the current price, i.e. trade randomly (random traders)

In our simulations we focused on the eﬀect of information

on the performance of agents throughout the market ses-

sion. We also analysed the results from the point of view

of stylized facts of stock markets. In order to reduce sta-

tistical errors we carried out 100 runs of the simulation.

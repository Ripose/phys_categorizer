Abstract

The main result of this paper that a martingale evolution can be chosen for Libor

such that all the Libor interest rates have a common market measure; the drift is

ﬁxed such that each Libor has the martingale property. Libor is described using a

ﬁeld theory model, and a common measure is seen to be emerge naturally for such

models. To elaborate how the martingale for the Libor belongs to the general class

of numeraire for the forward interest rates, two other numeraire’s are considered,

namely the money market measure that makes the evolution of the zero coupon

bonds a martingale, and the forward measure for which the forward bond price is a

martingale. The price of an interest rate cap is computed for all three numeraires,

and is shown to be numeraire invariant. Put-call parity is discussed in some detail

1

and shown to emerge due to some non-trivial properties of the numeraires. Some

properties of swaps, and their relation to caps and ﬂoors, are brieﬂy discussed.

1 Introduction

Libor (London Inter Bank Overnight Rates) are the interest rates for Eurodollar deposits.

Libor is one of the main instruments for interest rates in the debt market, and is widely

used for multifarious purposes in ﬁnance. The main focus of this paper is on the properties

of Libor, and in particular ﬁnding a common measure that yields a martingale evolution

[5] for all Libor. Two other numeraires for the forward interest rates are also considered,

namely the money market numeraire and the forward measure for bonds.

All calculations are performed using the ﬁeld theory for the forward interest rates

that has been introduced in [1, 2, 3]. The main advantage of modelling the forward

interest rates using ﬁeld theory is that there are inﬁnitely many random variables at each

instant driving the forward rates. In particular, for the case of Libor rates, it will be

shown, unlike the usual models in ﬁnance, a numeraire can be chosen so that all the

Libor instruments simultaneously have a martingale evolution [4].

The price of any ﬁnancial instrument in the future has to be discounted by a numeraire

to obtain its current price. The freedom of choosing a numeraire results from the fact

that for every numeraire there is a compensating drift such that the price of any traded

instrument is independent of the numeraire. ’Numeraire invariance’ is an important tool

in creating models for the pricing of ﬁnancial instruments [5], and is veriﬁed by using

three numeraires for pricing an interest caplet. As expected, the price of the caplet is

numeraire invariant.

2

In Section 2 the ﬁeld theory of forward rates is brieﬂy reviewed. In Section 3 the three

numeraires are discussed, and the corresponding drift velocities are evaluated. In Section

4 the price of a mid-curve interest caplet is priced for the three numeraires, in Section

5 put-call parity is derived for the three cases, in Section 6 interest swaps are discussed,

and with some conclusion drawn in Section 7.

2 Field Theory Model of Forward Interest Rates

The ﬁeld theory of forward rates is a general framework for modelling the interest rates

that allows for a wide choice of evolution equation for the interest rates.

The Libor forward interest rates f (t, x) are the interest rates, ﬁxed at time t, for an

instantaneous loan at future times x > t.1 Let A(t, x) be a two dimensional ﬁeld driving

the evolution of forward rates f (t, x) through time, deﬁned by

∂f (t, x)
∂t

= α(t, x) + σ(t, x)A(t, x)

(1)

where α(t, x) is the drift of the forward interest rates that will be ﬁxed by a choice of

numeraire, and σ(t, x) is the volatility that is ﬁxed from the market [1]. One is free to

choose the dynamics of how the ﬁeld A(t, x) evolves.

Integrating eq. 1 yields

f (t, x) = f (t0, x) +

dt′α(t′, x) +

dt′σ(t′, x)A(t′, x)

The price of a Libor Bond, at present time t, that matures at some future time T > t

is denoted by B(t, T ), and is deﬁned in terms of the forward interest rates as follows.

B(t, T ) = e−

T
t dxf (t,x)

R

Following Baaquie and Bouchaud [6], the Lagrangian that describes the evolution of

instantaneous Libor forward rates is deﬁned by three parameters µ, λ, η, and is given by2

L[A] = −

A2(t, z) +

(cid:18)

∂2A(t, z)
∂2z

)

(cid:19)

where market (psychological) future time is deﬁned by z = (x − t)η.

The Lagrangian in eq. 4 contains a squared Laplacian term that describes the stiﬀness

of the forward rate curve. Baaquie and Bouchaud [6] have determined the empirical

values of the three constants µ, λ, η, and have demonstrated that this formulation is able

to accurately account for the phenomenology of Libor interest rate dynamics. Ultimately,

all the pricing formulae for caps and ﬂoors depend on 1) the volatility function σ(t, x), 2)

parameters µ, λ, η contained in the Lagrangian, and lastly 3) on the initial term structure.

The action S[A] and the partition function Z of the Lagrangian is deﬁned as

ﬁeld A(t, x).

(cid:17)

All ﬁnancial instruments of the interest rates are obtained by performing a path

integral over the (ﬂuctuating) two dimensional quantum ﬁeld A(t, z). The expectation

value for an instrument, say L[A], is deﬁned by the functional average over all values of

A(t, z), weighted by the probability measure eS/Z; the following notation will be used

for denoting the expectation value

This a key equation that relates the formulation of ﬁnance based on stochastic calculus [8]

to the one based on path integrals [1]; both formulations evaluate the same expectation

values using diﬀerent formalisms – in the path integral approach the averaging is carried

out by performing an inﬁnite dimensional functional integration.

For simplicity of notation, we only consider the case of η = 1 and replace all integra-

tions over z with those over future time x.

3 Numeraire and Drift

The drift velocity α(t, x) is ﬁxed by the choice of numeraire. The Libor market measure

is ﬁrst discussed, and then the forward measure and money market measure are discussed

5

to elaborate diﬀerent choices for the numeraire of forward rates, and the drift velocity for

each is then evaluated.

3.1 Libor Market Measure

For the purpose of modeling Libor term structure, it is convenient to choose an evolution

such that all the Libor rates have a martingale evolution. The deposit and payment

dates are pre-ﬁxed at 90-day intervals, denoted by Tn. The Libor forward interest rates,

denoted by L(t, Tn), are simple interest rates, agreed upon at time t < Tn, for the payment

that one would receive for a future time deposit from Tn to Tn + ℓ, with payments made

in arrear at (future) time Tn + ℓ.

In terms of the (compounded) forward interest rate Libor is given by

L(t, Tn) =

Tn+ℓ
Tn

dxf (t,x) − 1

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

(10)

To understand the discounting that yields a martingale evolution of Libor rates L(t0, Tn)

re-write Libor as follows

L(t, Tn) =

Tn+ℓ

(cid:2)

The Libor is interpreted as being equal to

B(t, Tn)−B(t, Tn +ℓ)

/l, with the discounting

factor for the Libor market measure being equal to B(t, Tn + ℓ). Hence, the martingale

(cid:3)

(cid:1)

condition for the market measure, denoted by EL[..], is given by

B(t0, Tn) − B(t0, Tn + ℓ)
B(t0, Tn + ℓ)

= EL

B(t∗, Tn) − B(t∗, Tn + ℓ)
B(t∗, Tn + ℓ)

(11)

i

In other words, the market measure is deﬁned such that each Libor is a martingale; that

(cid:0)

h

is, for t∗ > t0

L(t0, Tn) = EL[L(t∗, Tn)]

(12)

(13)

(14)

(15)

In terms of the underlying forward interest rates, the Libor’s are given by the following

Tn+l

Tn+l

F0 ≡

dxf (t0, x) ; F∗ ≡

dxf (t∗, x)

⇒ L(t0, Tn) =

(cid:1)

(cid:0)

and hence from eqs. 12 and 14 the martingale condition for Libor can be written as

eF0 = EL[eF∗]

Denote the drift for the market measure by αL(t, x), and let Tn ≤ x < Tn+ℓ; the evolution

equation for the Libor forward interest rates is given, similar to eq. 2, by

f (t, x) = f (t0, x) +

dt′αL(t′, x) +

deﬁnition

The Libor drift velocity αL(t, x) is negative, as is required for compensating growing

payments due to the compounding of interest.

There is a discontinuity in the value of αL(t, x) at forward time x = Tn; from its

αL(t, Tn) = 0

(20)

Approaching the value αL(t, x) from x > Tn, the discontinuity is given by

∆αL(t, Tn) ≡ lim

αL(t, Tn) − αL(t, Tn)

x→Tn+

= −σ(t, x)

dx′D(x, x′; t)σ(t, x′)

(21)

Since the time-interval for Libor ℓ = 90 days is quite small, one can approximate the

Tn

Tn−ℓ

Z

drift by the following

αL(t, x) ≃ −(x − Tn)σ2(t, x) ; Tn ≤ x < Tn + ℓ

(22)

since the normalization of the volatility function can always be chosen so that D(x, x; t) =

1 [1]. The value of discontinuity at x = Tn is then approximately given by −ℓσ2(t, Tn)

Fig. 2 shows the behaviour of the drift velocity αF (t, x), with the value of σ(t, x) taken

from the market [1],[11]. One can see from the graph that, in a given Libor interval, the

drift velocity is approximately linear in forward time and the maximum drift goes as

σ2(t, x), both of which is expected from eq. 22.

3.2 Libor Forward Measure

It is often convenient to have a discounting factor that renders the futures price of Libor

Bonds into a martingale. Consider the Libor forward bond given by

FL(t0, Tn+1) = e−

dxf (t0,x) =

Tn+1
Tn

R

B(t0, Tn+1)
B(t0, Tn)

The forward numeraire is given by B(t0, Tn); the drift velocity is ﬁxed so that the future

price of a Libor bond is equal to its forward value; hence

Libor bond price a martingale. To determine the corresponding drift velocity αF (t, x),

the right side of eq. 24 is explicitly evaluated. Note from eq. 2

3.3 Money Market Measure

4 Pricing a Mid-Curve Cap

An interest rate cap is composed out of a linear sum of individual caplets. The pricing

formula for an interest rate caplet is obtained for a general volatility function σ(t, x) and

propagator D(x, x

; t) that drive the underlying Libor forward rates.

′

A mid-curve caplet can be exercised at any ﬁxed time t∗ that is less then the time

Tn at which the caplet matures. Denote by Caplet(t0, t∗, Tn) the price – at time t0 – of

an interest rate European option contract that must be exercised at time t∗ > t0 for an

11

interest rate caplet that puts an upper limit to the interest from time Tn to Tn + ℓ. Let

the principal amount be equal to ℓV , and the caplet rate be K. The caplet is exercised

at time t∗, with the payment made in arrears at time Tn + ℓ. Note that although the

payment is made at time Tn + ℓ, the amount that will be paid is ﬁxed at time t∗. The

various time intervals that deﬁne the interest rate caplet are shown in Fig.3.

Figure 3: Time intervals in the pricing of a caplet.

The payoﬀ function of an interest rate caplet is the value of the caplet when it matures,

at t0 = t∗, and is given by

Caplet(t∗, t∗, Tn) = ℓV B(t∗, Tn + ℓ)

As will be shown in Section 5, the price of the caplet automatically determines the price

of a ﬂoorlet due to put-call parity, and hence the price of the ﬂoorlet does not need an

independent derivation.

An interest rate cap of a duration over a longer period is made from the sum over the

caplets spanning the requisite time interval. Consider a mid-curve cap, to be exercised

at time t∗, with strike price Kj from time jℓ to time j(+1)ℓ, and with the interest cap

starting from time Tm = mℓ and ending at time (n + 1)ℓ; its price is given by

Cap(t0, t∗) =

Caplet(t0, t∗, Tj; Kj)

and a similar expression for an interest rate ﬂoor in terms of the ﬂoorlets for a single

Libor interval.

4.1 Forward Measure Calculation for Caplet

The numeraire for the forward measure is given by the Libor Bond B(t, Tn). Hence the

caplet is a martingale when discounted by B(t, Tn); the price of the caplet at time t0 < t∗

is consequently given by

Caplet(t0, t∗, Tn)

4.2 Libor Market Measure Calculation for Caplet

The Libor market measure has as its numeraire the Libor bond B(t∗, Tn + ℓ); the caplet

is a martingale when discounted by this numeraire, and hence the price of the caplet at

time t0 < t∗ is given by

The price of the caplet obtained from the forward measure is equal to the one obtained

using the Libor market measure since, from eqs. 35 and 36, one can prove the following

remarkable result

B(t, Tn)ΨF (G)(X − e−G)+ = B(t, Tn + ℓ)ΨL(G)(XeG − 1)+

(42)

The identity above shows how the three factors required in the pricing of an interest

rate caplet, namely the discount factors, the drift velocities and the payoﬀ functions, all

‘conspire’ to yield numeraire invariance for the price of the interest rate option.

The payoﬀ function is correctly given by the price of the caplet, since in the limit of

t0 → t∗, eq. 37 yields

Hence we see that the money market numeraire yields the same price for the caplet as

the ones obtained from the forward and Libor market measure, as expected, but with a

derivation that is very diﬀerent from the previous ones.

5 Put-Call Parity for Caplets and Floorlets

Put-call parity for caplets and ﬂoorlets is a model independent result, and is derived by

demanding that the prices be equal of two portfolios – having identical payoﬀs at maturity

18

– formed out of a caplet and the money market account on the one hand, and a ﬂoorlet

and futures contract on the other hand [13]. Failure of the prices to obey the put-call

parity relation would then lead to arbitrage opportunities. More precisely, put-call parity

yields the following relation between the price of a caplet and a ﬂoorlet

Caplet(t0, t∗, Tn) + ˜V B(t0, Tn + ℓ) = F loorlet(t0, t∗, Tn) + ˜V B(t0, Tn + ℓ)XeF0

(51)

where the other two instruments are the money market account and a futures contract.

Re-arranging eq. 51 and simplifying yields

Caplet(t0, t∗, Tn) − F loorlet(t0, t∗, Tn) = ℓV B(t0, Tn + ℓ)[L(t0, Tn) − K]

(52)

= value of swaplet

The right hand side of above equation is the price, at time t0, of a forward or deferred

swaplet, which is an interest rate swaplet that matures at time Tn; swaps are discussed

in Section 6.

parity.

In this Section a derivation is given for put-call parity for (Libor) options ; the deriva-

tion is given for the three diﬀerent numeraires, and illustrates how the properties are

essential for the numeraires to price the caplet and ﬂoor so that they satisfy put-call

The payoﬀ for the caplet and a ﬂoorlet is generically given by

(a − b)+ = (a − b)Θ(a − b)

where the Heaviside step function Θ(x) is deﬁned by

Θ(x) =

1
2 x = 0

1 x > 0

0 x < 0

The derivation of put-call parity hinges on the following identity

Θ(x) + Θ(−x) = 1

(53)

since it yields, for the diﬀerence of the payoﬀ functions of the put and call options, the

following

(a − b)+ − (b − a)+ = (a − b)Θ(a − b) − (b − a)Θ(b − a)

= a − b

(54)

5.1 Put-Call Parity for Forward Measure

The price of a caplet and ﬂoorlet at time t0 is given by discounting the payoﬀ functions

with the discounting factor of B(t0, Tn). From eq. 35

Caplet(t0, t∗, Tn) = B(t0, Tn)EF

Caplet(t∗, t∗, Tn)
B(t∗, Tn)

(cid:2)
= ˜V B(t0, Tn)EF

Hence, since for constant X we have EF (X) = XEF (1) = X, from above equation and

eq. 57, the price of a caplet and ﬂoorlet obeys the put-call relation

Caplet(t0, t∗, Tn) − F loorlet(t0, t∗, Tn) = ˜V B(t0, Tn)EF

X − e−F∗
(cid:16)

(cid:17)

= ˜V B(t0, Tn)(X − e−F0)

= ℓV B(t0, Tn + ℓ)(L(t0, Tn) − K)

(59)

and yields eq. 51 as expected.

5.2 Put-Call for Libor Market Measure

The price of a caplet for the Libor market measure is given from eq. 39 by

Caplet(t0, t∗, Tn) = ˜V B(t0, Tn + ℓ)EL

XeF∗ − 1

(cid:0)

and the ﬂoorlet is given by

F loorlet(t0, t∗, Tn) = ˜V B(t0, Tn + ℓ)EL

1 − XeF∗

(cid:0)
Hence, similar to the derivation given in eq.57, we have

+

(cid:1)

(cid:1)

(60)

(61)

Caplet(t0, t∗, Tn) − F loorlet(t0, t∗, Tn) = ˜V B(t0, Tn + ℓ)EL

XeF∗ − 1

(62)

For the Libor market measure, from eq.15

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

EL[eF∗] = eF0

and hence equation above, together with eq. 62, yields the expected eq. 51 put-call parity

relation

Caplet(t0, t∗, Tn) − F loorlet(t0, t∗, Tn) = ˜V B(t0, Tn + ℓ)(XeF0 − 1)

= ℓV B(t0, Tn + ℓ)(L(t0, Tn) − K)

21

5.3 Put-Call for Money Market Measure

The money market measure has some interesting intermediate steps in the derivation of

put-call parity. Recall the caplet for the money market measure is given from eq. 48 as

Using the deﬁnition of the payoﬀ function for a caplet given in eq. 31 yields

Caplet(t0, t∗, Tn) = ˜V EM

XB(t∗, Tn) − B(t∗, Tn + ℓ)

The price of the ﬂoor is given by

F loorlet(t0, t∗, Tn) = ˜V EM

Consider the diﬀerence of put and call on a caplet; similar to the previous cases, using

eq. 53 yields the following

Caplet(t0, t∗, Tn) − F loorlet(t0, t∗, Tn) = ˜V EM

XB(t∗, Tn) − B(t∗, Tn + ℓ)

(63)

(cid:3)(cid:17)
The martingale condition given in eq. 28 yields the expected result given in eq. 51 that

6 Swaps, Caps and Floors

An interest swap is contracted between two parties. Payments are made at ﬁxed intervals,

usually 90 or 180 days, denoted by Tn, with the contract having notional principal ℓV ,

and a pre-ﬁxed total duration, with the last payment made at time TN + ℓ. A swap

of the ﬁrst kind, namely swapI , is where one party pays at a ﬁxed interest rate RS on

the notional principal, and the other party pays a ﬂoating interest rate based on the

prevailing Libor rate. A swap of the second kind, namely swapII , is where the party pays

at the ﬂoating Libor rate and receives payments at ﬁxed interest rate RS.

To quantify the value of the swap, let the contract start at time T0, with payments

made at ﬁxed interval Tn = T0 + nℓ, with times n = 0, 1, 2, ..., N.

Consider a swap in which the payments at the ﬁxed rate is given by RS; the values

of the swaps are then given by [13]

swapI(T0, RS) = V

1 − B(T0, TN + ℓ) − ℓRS

(cid:3)

The par value of the swap when it is initiated, that is at time T0, is zero; hence the

par ﬁxed rate RP , from eq. 64, is given by [13]

swapI(T0, RP ) = 0 = swapII(T0, RP )

= ℓV

B(t0, Tn + ℓ)

L(t0, Tn) − K

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

The price of a swap at time t0 < T0 is similar to the forward price of a Treasury Bond,

and is called a forward swap or a deferred swap.3 Put-call parity for caps and ﬂoors gives

the value of a forward swap, and hence

swapI(t0, RS) = ℓV

B(t0, Tn + ℓ)

L(t, Tn) − RS

swapII(t0, RS) = ℓV

B(t0, Tn + ℓ)

(cid:2)
RS − L(t0, Tn)

(cid:3)

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

The value of the swaps, from eqs. 66 and 67, can be seen to have the following

intuitive interpretation: At time Tn the value of swapI is the diﬀerence between the

ﬂoating payment received at the rate of L(t, Tn), and the ﬁxed payments paid out at the

rate of RS. All payments are made at time Tn + ℓ, and hence for obtaining its value at

time t0 need to be discounted by the bond B(t0, Tn + ℓ).

The deﬁnition of L(t0, Tn) given in eq. 10 yields the following

ℓV

B(t0, Tn + ℓ)L(t0, Tn) = V

B(t0, Tn) − B(t0, Tn + ℓ)

Hence, from eq. 66

swapI(t0, RS) = ℓV

B(t0, T0) − B(t0, TN + ℓ) − ℓRS

B(t0, Tn + ℓ)

(69)

3A swap that is entered into after the time of the initial payments, that is, at time t0 > T0 can also

be priced and is given in [13]; however, for the case of a swaption, this case is not relevant.

24

with a similar expression for swapII. Note that the forward swap prices, for t0 → T0,

converge to the expressions for swaps given in eqs. 66 and 66.

At time t0 the par value for the ﬁxed rate of the swap, namely RP (t0), is given by

both the forward swaps being equal to zero. Hence

swapI(t0, RP (t0)) = 0 = swapII(t0, RP (t0))

⇒ ℓRP (t0) =

We have obtained the anticipated result that the par value for the forward swap is ﬁxed

by the forward bond prices F (t0, T0, Tn + ℓ), and converges to the par value of the swap

when it matures at time t0 = T0.

In summary, put-call parity for cap and ﬂoor, from eqs. 65 and 66 yields, for K = RS

Cap(t∗, t∗; RS) − F loor(t0, t∗; RS) = swapI(t0, RS)

(71)

as expected [13].

7 Conclusions

A common Libor market measure was derived, and it was shown that a single numeraire

renders all Libor into martingales. Two other numeraires were studied for the forward

interest rates, each having its own drift velocity.

All the numeraires have their own speciﬁc advantages, and it was demonstrated by

actual computation that all three yield the same price for an interest rate caplet, and

25

also satisfy put-call parity as is necessary for the prices interest caps and ﬂoors to be free

from arbitrage opportunities.

The expression for the payoﬀ function for the caplet given in eq. 30, namely

Caplet(t0, t∗, Tn) = ℓV B(t∗, Tn + ℓ)

L(t∗, Tn) − K

(cid:2)

+

(cid:3)

is seen to be the correct one as it reproduces the payoﬀ functions that are widely used

in the literature, yields a pricing formula for the interest rate caplet that is numeraire

invariant, and satisﬁes the requirement of put-call parity as well.

An analysis of swaps shows that put-call parity for caps and ﬂoors correctly reproduces

the swap future as expected.

We propose a model of multiagent systems whose agents have a tendency to balance their decisions
in time. We ﬁnd phase transitions to oscillatory behavior, explainable by the aggregation of agents
into two groups. On a longer time scale, we ﬁnd that the aggregation of smart agents is able to
explain the lifetime distribution of epochs to 8 decades of probability.

PACS numbers: 02.50.-r, 05.40.-a, 89.20.-a

Many natural and artiﬁcial systems involve interact-
ing agents, each making independent decisions to pursue
their own short-term objectives, but globally exhibiting
long-time correlations beyond the memory sizes or the ac-
tion cycles of the individuals [1, 2, 3]. Examples include
the price ﬂuctuations in ﬁnancial markets [4], traﬃc pat-
terns on the Internet [5], and the lifespan and metabolic
time scales of living organisms. It is interesting to con-
sider the extent to which the inherent properties of the
systems can aﬀect the temporal behavior. Correlations
beyond individual memory sizes can be consequences of
interaction among agents. For example, some agents may
ﬁnd it advantageous to correlate their decisions over an
extended period of time,
leading to the emergence of
epochs dominated by a group. This constitutes a system
with multiple time scales. On a long time scale, it is de-
scribed by the ages of the epochs, besides the shorter time
scale of the underlying dynamics (usually determined by
the memory sizes or the action cycles of the agents).

In this Rapid Communication, we analyze a multiagent
model with the above features. The model is most ap-
plicable to ﬁnancial markets in which agents trade with
ﬁnite capital, but can be extended to other multiagent
systems such as routers in communication networks at-
tempting to transmit multiclass traﬃc in a fair way. In
an eﬀort to avoid overdrawing her capital, an agent mak-
ing a buying decision at an instant is more inclined to
make a subsequent selling decision, and vice versa. This
creates a natural short-time scale for the buy-and-sell cy-
cles of the market. To model the adaptive attributes of
the agents, each agent can occasionally revise her deci-
sion by following some adaptive strategy she perceives to
be successful, analogous to the Minority Game (MG) [3].
We are interested in studying how agents aggregate in
their decision making process in the short as well as long
time scales.

Speciﬁcally, we consider a population of N agents com-
peting to maximize their individual utility, while striving
to maintain a balance of their capital, N being odd. At
each time step t, agent i makes a bid bi(t) = 1 or 0,
and the minority group among the N agents wins. “1”
and “0” may represent “buy” and “sell” decisions in a ﬁ-
nancial market. To model agents with concerns for both
ﬁnite capital and adatpive strategies, agent i makes buy-

ing bids with probabilities P [bi(t) = 1], where

P [bi(t) = 1] = kf (ci(t)) + (1 − k)Pstrategy[bi(t) = 1], (1)

where 0 ≤ k ≤ 1 is the restoring strength determining
the statistical weights of the two factors in Eq. (1).

The ﬁrst term models the consideration of ﬁnite capital
in an agent’s buying decisions at time t, whose probabili-
ties increase with her capital ci(t) at the instant. For ex-
ample, we choose in this Rapid Communication a three-
step function f (ci(t)) which is equal to 0, 1/2 and 1 re-
spectively in the ranges 0 ≤ ci(t) < c<, c< ≤ ci(t) < c>,
and c> ≤ ci(t) ≤ 1. For a buying bid, the capital reduces
by (1 − α)ci(t), in exchange for the same value of stocks
(to the lowest order approximation, we have neglected
price changes due to ﬂuctuations in supply and demand).
Similarly, for a selling bid, the volume of stocks reduces
by (1 − α)[1 − ci(t)], in exchange for the same value of
capital. Thus, the capital change is given by

ci(t + 1) = αci(t) + (1 − α)[1 − bi(t)].

(2)

In Eq. (2), the second term counts the number of selling
bids in history at a value of 1−α, and the ﬁrst term shows
that its eﬀect on the capital is discounted exponentially
at a rate of α per step. Hence, α is referred to as the
restoring memory factor. Small α corresponds to short-
term restoring, namely, balancing buying and selling in
small number of steps, whereas large α corresponds to
long-term restoring. When there are more selling (buy-
ing) bids in the recent bid history, the capital tends to be
high (low). Through the probability f (ci(t)), the agent
tends to balance the more frequent recent bids with the
opposite actions. This is equivalent to adding a restoring
force to the decision making process of the agents.

The second term models an agent’s tendency to use
adaptive strategies, and the probability Pstrategy[bi(t) =
1] can be determined by standard games such as the MG
In
[3] or the Evolutionary Minority Game (EMG) [6].
MG, strategies are binary functions mapping the most
recent m steps to an output bid. Before the game starts,
each agent randomly picks s strategies with replacement.
At each time step, the cumulative payoﬀs of strategies
that give a correct prediction increase by 1, while those
predicting incorrectly decrease by 1. Each agent then
follow the strategy with the highest cumulative payoﬀ
among those she owns. The EMG diﬀers from the MG

in details, but shares the same feature that the adopted
strategies evolve according to historical successes.

The system behavior is characterized by the variance
of buyers at the steady state, which is often considered
as a measure of market eﬃciency.
In the simulations,
all agents initially hold equal value of capital and stocks,
and the cumulative payoﬀs of strategies in MG are ran-
domized with variance R [7]. As shown in Fig. 1(a),
the variances at k = 0 reduce to those of MG or EMG,
since the agents make their bids solely based on adaptive
strategies. However, when k approaches 1, the variances
approach values dependent on α, irrespective of the type
of the adaptive strategies. Thus in the strongly restoring
limit, the system behavior remains the same for a given
value of α, as long as some adaptive strategy is adopted.
For large α in the strongly restoring limit, the restor-
ing force tends to bring the variance of the system to
the coin-toss limit σ2/N = 1/4, implying that the agents
make random and uncorrelated decisions. For small α
in the same limit, the variance has a value lower than
the coin-toss limit. Note that the variances in the limit
k approaching 1 jumps discontinuously to the coin-toss
limit at k=1 (that is, when the decisions are solely based
on the concern for ﬁnite capital), showing that adaptive
strategies, even only rarely used by the agents, are essen-
tial in bringing the system to an eﬃcient state.

Figure 1(b) shows the variance in the strongly restor-
ing limit, which increases with the restoring memory fac-
tor α. It undergoes a continuous phase transition to the
coin-toss limit at a critical α, whose value is independent
of the type of adaptive strategies. To understand the
nature of this phase transition, we measure the distribu-
tion of capital at a steady-state instant of the system. As
shown in the inset of Fig. 1(b), the distribution has two
sharp peaks in the short-term memory phase, which dis-
appears in the long-term memory phase. The two-peaked
distribution arises from the intentions of the agents to
balance their budget in a small number of steps, causing
them to aggregate into two groups, A and B, analogous
to the crowd-anticrowd picture of multiagent systems [8].
Group A consists of agents making alternating buy and
sell bids at odd and even time steps respectively, and
agents in group B make opposite alternating bids. This
self-organization of agent behavior is further conﬁrmed
by the spectrum of a Fast Fourier Transform of the cap-
ital of a typical agent, which shows a sharp peak at the
frequency 0.5. In fact, one can show from Eq. (1) that
when α < αc ≡ (1−c>)/(1−c<), a limit cycle of period 2
can be formed from the alternating bids of an agent. This
enables the capital of an agent to completely avoid stay-
ing in the intermediate region (c<, c>) of random bids,
resulting in a segregated phase with two groups of agents.
The value of αc coincides with the phase transition point
in Fig. 1(b).
In contrast, for α > αc, there appears a
growing fraction of agents in the region of random bids,
and the period-2 dynamics is not sustained, resulting in
a clustered phase with a coin-tossed variance. We note in
passing that segregated and clustered behavior have been

observed in a model of EMG due to a diﬀerent cause [9],
but the issue of time scales has not been studied.

We now consider temporal eﬀects beyond the period-
2 oscillations, focusing on the limit k approaching 1 in
the segregated phase. At each time step, an average of
(1−k)N ≡ ˜k agents make decisions according to adaptive
strategies, and thus have a chance to switch from group
A to B, or vice versa. Then, groups A and B change from
majority to minority, or vice versa, in a time scale longer
than the period-2 oscillations. The emergence of these
multiple time scales is illustrated in Fig. 2, in which the
buyer population is essentially oscillating with period-2.
Occasional phase slips in the buyer population signify
switches from group A being the winners to group B, or
vice versa. This corresponds to instants in Fig. 2 where
the population of group A crosses the minority-majority
boundary. The lifetime of an epoch is the duration for
which group A or B remains winning continuously.

To analyze the variance and the lifetime of the epochs,
we consider the example of using MG with m = 1 as
the adaptive strategies. There are only 4 strategies,
which are functions F mapping an input b according
to: F (b) = b (follower), F (b) = 0 (all-sell), F (b) = 1
(all-buy), F (b) = −b (contrarian). Since the history is
dominated by period-2 oscillations, the contrarian strat-

egy has the highest cumulative payoﬀ, and the follower
strategy the lowest. The all-buy and all-sell strategies
predict correctly half of the time, and hence their cu-
mulative payoﬀs are intermediate. At the steady state,
agents holding at least one contrarian strategy would
use them when they make strategic decisions, and at
those instants bid for the minority decision in an epoch
of alternating winning bids. For agents holding s ran-
domly drawn strategies, the probability of ﬁnding an
agent making this kind of decision is 1 − (3/4)s. Oth-
erwise, if agents have at least one of the all-buy or all-
sell strategies, their strategic bid follows the minority
decision in an epoch with probability 1/2. The proba-
bility of this case is (3/4)s − (1/4)s. With probability
(1/4)s, the agents only have follower strategies at hand,
and their strategic bid follows the majority decision in
an epoch. On average, the probabilities of an adaptive
strategy bidding for the minority decision in an epoch is
T = 1 − (3/4)s/2 − (1/4)s/2.

First, we analyze the problem in the mean-rate ap-
proximation. At each time step, the average probability
that an agent uses an adaptive strategy and switches side
is, respectively, (1 − k)T from majority to minority, and
(1 − k)(1 − T ) in the opposite direction. This allows us
to derive the master equation for the distribution of the
number NA of agents in group A, and solve it numerically.
As shown in Fig. 3, the average epoch lifetime hLi de-
creases with the average number ˜k of agents using adap-
tive strategies. When ˜k approaches 0, hLi appears to
approach the expected result of hLi ∼ ˜k−1. This implies
that during the average lifetime of an epoch, an average
of ˜khLi ≈ 5 agents make strategic decisions which may
result in switching sides. Furthermore, the prediction
of the mean-rate approximation has an excellent agree-
ment with the simulation results. A similarly excellent
agreement is shown in the inset of Fig. 3 for the vari-
ance σ2. When ˜k approaches 0, the master equation for
P (NA) can be approximated by a Markov chain, yield-
ing P (NA) ∼ [(1 − T )/T ]|NA−(N +1)/2| and a variance of
2[(1 − T )/(2T − 1)]2 + 2[(1 − T )/(2T − 1)] + 1/4.

Figure 4 shows that the epoch lifetimes follow an expo-
nential distribution near its maximum at small L. The
exponential decay rate depends on ˜k and is insensitive
to N . The mean-rate approximation has an excellent

agreement with simulation results in this regime.

When L increases further, the distribution crosses over
to an exponential one with a lower decay rate dependent
on both ˜k and N . However, the mean-rate approximation
predicts a lower distribution of long epochs than simu-
lations. As shown in the inset of Fig. 4, the decay rates
of both the simulation and the mean-rate approximation
approaches the same asymptotic value for large N , but
their diﬀerences are signiﬁcant in the mesoscopic regime.
Analysis shows that the diﬀerences scale as N −1.1±0.1.

The discrepancy arises from the inability of the mean-
rate approximation to diﬀerentiate the aggregation ef-
fects of various agents in the majority and minority
groups. Consider again the example of m = 1. For
agents holding contrarian strategies, their strategic bid
follows the minority group. They are referred to as smart
agents. Conversely, for agents holding follower strategies
only, their strategic bid follows the majority group, and
they are referred to as dump agents. The strategic bids of
other agents, referred to as middle agents, have an equal
preference to the majority and minority groups. Suppose
it happens that the majority group in an epoch consists of
less smart agents than the minority group. It follows that
when an agent in the majority group chooses to make a
strategic decision, it is less likely that she switches to the
minority group. The converse is valid for dump agents,
but to a lesser extent due to their smaller population.
This reduces the ﬂow of agents from the majority to the
minority group, and hence lengthen the lifespan of an
epoch. This eﬀect is most signiﬁcant in the mesoscopic
regime when the ﬂuctuations of the smart agent aggre-
gate and the minority group size are important.

The evidence that smart agents aggregate in the minor-
ity group at the expense of the majority group is demon-
strated in Fig. 5. We measure the diﬀerence in the num-
ber of smart agents between the minority and majority
groups (Nmin,s − Nmaj,s) averaged over an epoch. Com-
pared with the distribution for short epochs, the peak
of the distribution for long epochs is shifted to the posi-
tive side. This shows that long epochs have more smart

This leads to the second approximation of our analysis,
the multirate approximation. We denote by NAs, NAm
and NAd the number of smart, middle and dump agents
in group A respectively. At each time step, the probabil-
ity that an agent of these types switches from the major-
ity to the minority group is 1 − k, (1 − k)/2 and 0 respec-
tively, and 0, (1−k)/2 and 1−k for the opposite switches.

can be formulated and solved by Monte Carlo methods.
As shown in Fig. 4, the multirate approximation yields a
signiﬁcantly higher probability for long epochs compared
with the mean-rate approximation, resulting in an ex-
cellent agreement with simulation results over 8 decades
of probability. Furthermore, the distribution of smart
agents derived from the multirate approximation has an
excellent agreement with simulation results, as shown in
Fig. 5. This shows that the aggregation of smart agents
is crucial in explaining the occurrence of long epochs.

Due to their generic nature, eﬀects of smart agent ag-
gregation are expected to be present for adaptive strate-
gies other than MG with m = 1. The essence is the stabi-
lization of the minority group by the smart agents, whose
strategies are favored by the sustenance of an epoch.
Note that the smart agents do not have any intrinsic
preference to either group A or B; they favor the group
they aggregate in as long as it is the minority. Diﬀer-
ences among the various adaptive strategies only come
from details of the transition rate between the majority
and minority groups. For example, we have analyzed MG
with m > 1 and found very similar results.

In summary, we have proposed a model of multiagent
systems with multiple time scales. When the tendency
to balance the decisions of the agents is strong, chang-
ing their intentions from long-term to short-term induces
phase transitions to oscillations with two groups of agents
making alternating but opposite decisions, and the be-
havior is independent of the details of the adaptive strate-
gies. On a longer time scale, the history is characterized
by epochs dominated by one of the two groups. Epochs
end when suﬃcient numbers of agents follow adaptive
strategies and switch to the winning side. Epochs are sta-
bilized by the aggregation of smart agents on the winning
side in the mesoscopic regime. These generic features
are relevant to multiagent systems such as ﬁnancial mar-
kets of agents with ﬁnite capital, distributed control of
multiclass traﬃc in communication networks, and other
systems with competing aggregates of agents.

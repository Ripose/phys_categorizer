Eﬀects of Saving and Spending Patterns on Holding Time

Department of Systems Science, School of Management, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, 100875, P.R. China

Abstract. The eﬀects of saving and spending patterns on holding time distribution of money are investi-

gated based on the ideal gas-like models. We show the steady-state distribution obeys an exponential law

when the saving factor is set uniformly, and a power law when the saving factor is set diversely. The power

distribution can also be obtained by proposing a new model where the preferential spending behavior is

considered. The association of the distribution with the probability of money to be exchanged has also

been discussed.

pioneering work along this line has been reviewed in a

popular article [13].

As well known, the exploration of the distribution of

money can be traced back at least a century to the work

of the Italian social economist Vilfredo Pareto, who stud-

ied the distribution of income among people in diﬀerent

western countries and found an inverse power law [14].

Recently this topic has been taken up with the emergence

of econophysicists among whom some believe that there

introduced the saving behavior into the model by adding

a saving factor s in the trading rule [6]. The simulation

results clearly indicate a robust Gibbs-like distribution

where the density of agents with money m decreases ex-

ponentially with m for s = 0, which is identical to the

result of A. Dr˘agulescu and V. M. Yakovenko’s random

two-agent exchanges model [5]. The distribution of money

changes to follow asymmetric Gibbs-like law when the

ﬁxed and uniform saving factor is set to be nonzero, while

a ‘critical’ Pareto distribution of money is found when

saving factor is set diversely among agents [6,7,8].

In a basic ideal gas-like model, the distribution of money

over the holding time follows an exponential law, where

saving behavior is not taken into account. The purpose

of this paper is to study how the introduction of saving

behavior aﬀects such kind of distribution. In next section,

we make a brief review of the basic ideal gas-like model

by which our work can be erected and of the measure-

ment of the distribution of holding time. In sections 3 and

4, we show that the uniform saving factor gives exponen-

tial distribution, while the diverse saving factor induces a

change to power distribution. Then we introduce prefer-

ential spending behavior into the model in section 5 and

Holding Time Distribution

We begin with the basic ideal gas-like model which was

introduced ﬁrstly by A. Dragulescu and V.M. Yakovenko

[5]. A close economy is considered in the model where

the amount of money M is conserved and the number

of agents N is ﬁxed. The money is possessed by agents

individually and agents can exchange money with each

other. Since the scale and initial distribution of money

and

have no eﬀect on the ﬁnal results, most of our simulations

diﬀerent moments or those of diﬀerent units of money at a

given moment are not the same. We introduce the proba-

bility distribution function of holding time Ph(τ ), which is

deﬁned so that the amount of money whose holding time

lies between τ and τ + dτ is equal to M Ph(τ )dτ . So, we

can get the normalization condition and the expression of

the expectation of holding time as follows:

were carried out with N = 250 and M = 25000 and the

amount of money held by each agent was set to be M/N

at the beginning. The trade in the economy is modelled to

take place round by round. In each round, two agents, i

and j for example, are chosen randomly to get engaged in

a trade among which agent i is ”receiver” and the other

one j is ”payer” . The amount of money that changes hand

∆m is determined by trading rule which ensures that the

amount of any agent’s money is non-negative and the total

money is conserved. A trading rule commonly used can be

expressed as ∆m = ε(mi + mj)/2, where ε is a random

number from zero to unity. As for which units of money

are chosen to be transferred, all in the payer’s hand is

equally probable.

In the ideal gas-like model, money is held by agents

In the simulations, suppose it is at round t0 that we

start to reord, and so, holding time is recorded as the

diﬀerence between the moments when the money takes

part in trade after t0 for the ﬁrst two times. The recording

mode is illustrated in Figure 1(a). Please note this mode

is diﬀerent from what we have adopted in Reference [16],

which is shown in Figure 1(b). The measurement results of

the two modes seem quite diﬀerent, however, they reﬂect

the same process in diﬀerent ways. We adopt herein the

mode (a) solely to facilitate the exposition. The typical

distribution of holding time is shown in Figure 2. It can

been seen from the inset of Figure 2 that the distribution

of holding time follows an exponential law:

that saving factors are randomly distributed among agents

The simulation results are shown in Figure 3, for some

values of s. It can be seen that the probability distribu-

tively.

To our surprise, once the diverse saving factor is intro-

duced into the model, as shown in Figure 4, the holding

time distribution changes to obey a power law instead of

an exponential law. This result indicates that the transfer-

ring process of money in this model is not a Poisson pro-

cess any more. The Poisson nature of the process is broken

due to the loss of homogeneity of the money transferring.

In the previous model, for any saving factor, the proba-

bility of each unit of money to participate in exchanges

at any round is equal because the saving factor is set to

be uniform for all agents. On the contrary, in this model

the transferring probability of money is not the same any

more due to the diversity of the saving factors. This con-

clusion was veriﬁed by two further measurements on the

tive holders after the steady distribution of money among

agents had been observed. The value is 0.86 which certiﬁes

again that there is more money in the hands of holders

with higher saving factors. The average value of saving

factors over the money transferred was also computed, its

value is about 0.52. This fact says that the money held

by agents with higher saving factor has lower probability

to take part in trade. If all money has equal probability,

combining with the fact that the agents with higher sav-

ing factors hold more money, it can be deduced that the

value of this kind of average saving factor should be about

0.86 all the time. Thus, we can conclude that the higher

gated based on the ideal gas-like models. We show the steady-state distribution obeys an exponential law

when the saving factor is set uniformly, and a power law when the saving factor is set diversely. The power

introduced the saving behavior into the model by adding

a saving factor s in the trading rule [6]. The simulation

results clearly indicate a robust Gibbs-like distribution

where the density of agents with money m decreases ex-

ponentially with m for s = 0, which is identical to the

result of A. Dr˘agulescu and V. M. Yakovenko’s random

two-agent exchanges model [5]. The distribution of money

changes to follow asymmetric Gibbs-like law when the

ﬁxed and uniform saving factor is set to be nonzero, while

a ‘critical’ Pareto distribution of money is found when

saving factor is set diversely among agents [6,7,8].

In a basic ideal gas-like model, the distribution of money

over the holding time follows an exponential law, where

saving behavior is not taken into account. The purpose

of this paper is to study how the introduction of saving

behavior aﬀects such kind of distribution. In next section,

we make a brief review of the basic ideal gas-like model

by which our work can be erected and of the measure-

ment of the distribution of holding time. In sections 3 and

4, we show that the uniform saving factor gives exponen-

tial distribution, while the diverse saving factor induces a

change to power distribution. Then we introduce prefer-

ential spending behavior into the model in section 5 and

Holding Time Distribution

We begin with the basic ideal gas-like model which was

introduced ﬁrstly by A. Dragulescu and V.M. Yakovenko

[5]. A close economy is considered in the model where

the amount of money M is conserved and the number

of agents N is ﬁxed. The money is possessed by agents

individually and agents can exchange money with each

other. Since the scale and initial distribution of money

and

have no eﬀect on the ﬁnal results, most of our simulations

diﬀerent moments or those of diﬀerent units of money at a

given moment are not the same. We introduce the proba-

bility distribution function of holding time Ph(τ ), which is

deﬁned so that the amount of money whose holding time

lies between τ and τ + dτ is equal to M Ph(τ )dτ . So, we

can get the normalization condition and the expression of

the expectation of holding time as follows:

were carried out with N = 250 and M = 25000 and the

amount of money held by each agent was set to be M/N

at the beginning. The trade in the economy is modelled to

take place round by round. In each round, two agents, i

and j for example, are chosen randomly to get engaged in

a trade among which agent i is ”receiver” and the other

one j is ”payer” . The amount of money that changes hand

∆m is determined by trading rule which ensures that the

amount of any agent’s money is non-negative and the total

money is conserved. A trading rule commonly used can be

expressed as ∆m = ε(mi + mj)/2, where ε is a random

number from zero to unity. As for which units of money

are chosen to be transferred, all in the payer’s hand is

equally probable.

In the ideal gas-like model, money is held by agents

In the simulations, suppose it is at round t0 that we

start to reord, and so, holding time is recorded as the

diﬀerence between the moments when the money takes

part in trade after t0 for the ﬁrst two times. The recording

mode is illustrated in Figure 1(a). Please note this mode

is diﬀerent from what we have adopted in Reference [16],

which is shown in Figure 1(b). The measurement results of

the two modes seem quite diﬀerent, however, they reﬂect

the same process in diﬀerent ways. We adopt herein the

mode (a) solely to facilitate the exposition. The typical

distribution of holding time is shown in Figure 2. It can

been seen from the inset of Figure 2 that the distribution

have been considered by Chakrabarti’s group, one is that

all agents have a uniform saving factor, the other one is

that saving factors are randomly distributed among agents

The simulation results are shown in Figure 3, for some

values of s. It can be seen that the probability distribu-

tively.

To our surprise, once the diverse saving factor is intro-

duced into the model, as shown in Figure 4, the holding

time distribution changes to obey a power law instead of

an exponential law. This result indicates that the transfer-

ring process of money in this model is not a Poisson pro-

cess any more. The Poisson nature of the process is broken

due to the loss of homogeneity of the money transferring.

In the previous model, for any saving factor, the proba-

bility of each unit of money to participate in exchanges

at any round is equal because the saving factor is set to

be uniform for all agents. On the contrary, in this model

the transferring probability of money is not the same any

more due to the diversity of the saving factors. This con-

clusion was veriﬁed by two further measurements on the

tive holders after the steady distribution of money among

agents had been observed. The value is 0.86 which certiﬁes

again that there is more money in the hands of holders

with higher saving factors. The average value of saving

factors over the money transferred was also computed, its

value is about 0.52. This fact says that the money held

by agents with higher saving factor has lower probability

to take part in trade. If all money has equal probability,

combining with the fact that the agents with higher sav-

ing factors hold more money, it can be deduced that the

value of this kind of average saving factor should be about

0.86 all the time. Thus, we can conclude that the higher

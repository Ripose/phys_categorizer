Many weighted scale-free networks are known to have a power-law correlation between strength
and degree of nodes, which, however, has not been well explicated. We investigate the dynamic
behaviors of resource/traﬃc ﬂow on scale-free networks. The dynamical system will evolve to a
kinetic equilibrium state, where the strength, deﬁned by the amount of resource or traﬃc load, is
correlated with the degree in a power-law form with tunable exponent. The analytical results agree
with simulations well.

I.

INTRODUCTION

A very interesting empirical phenomenon in the study
of weighted networks is the power-law correlation be-
tween strength s and degree k of nodes s ∼ kθ [1, 2, 3, 4].
Very recently, Wang et al have proposed a mutual selec-
tion model to explain the origin of this power-law correla-
tion [5]. This model can provide a partial explanation for
social weighted networks, however, is far from the reality
of technological networks.

In many cases, the concepts of edge-weight and node-
strength are associated with network dynamics. For ex-
ample, the weight in communication networks is often
deﬁned by the load along with the edge [6], and the
strength in epidemic contact networks is deﬁned by the
individual infectivity [7]. On one hand, although the
weight/strength distribution may evolve to a stable form,
the individual value is being changed with time by the
dynamical process upon network. On the other hand, the
weight/strength distribution will highly aﬀect the corre-
sponding dynamic behaviors [8, 9, 10].

Inspired by the interplay of weight and network dy-
namics, Barrat et al proposed an evolution model (BBV
model for short) for weighted networks [11, 12]. Although
this model can naturally reproduce the power-law distri-
bution of degree, edge-weight, and node-strength, it fails
to obtain the power-law correlation between strength and
degree. In BBV model, the dynamics of weight and net-
work structure are assumed in the same time scale, that
is, in each time step, the weight distribution and network
topology changes simultaneously. Here we argue that the
above two time scales are far diﬀerent. Actually, in many
real-life situation, the individual weight varies momently
whereas the network topology only slightly changed dur-
ing a relatively long period. Similar to the traﬃc dy-
namics based on local routing protocol [13, 14, 15, 16],

we investigate the dynamic behaviors of resource/traﬃc
ﬂow on scale-free networks with given structures, which
may give some illuminations about the origin of power-
law correlation between strength and degree in weighted
scale-free Networks.

II. RESOURCE FLOW WITH PREFERENTIAL
ALLOCATION

As mentioned above, strength usually represents re-
sources or substance allocated to each node, such as
wealth of individuals of ﬁnancial contact networks [17],
the number of passengers in airports of world-wide air-
port networks [18], the throughput of power stations of
electric power grids [19], and so on. These resources also
ﬂow constantly in networks: Money shifts from one to an-
other by currency, electric power is transmitted to every
city from power plants by several power hubs, and pas-
sengers travel from one airport to another. Further more,
resource prefers to ﬂow to lager-degree nodes. In trans-
port networks, large nodes imply hubs or centers in traﬃc
system. So passengers can get a quick arrival to destina-
tion by choosing larger airports or stations. In ﬁnancial
systems, people also favors to buy stocks of larger com-
panies or deposited in banks with more capital because
larger companies and banks generally have more power to
make proﬁts and more capacity to avoid losses. Inspired
by the above facts, we propose a simple mechanism to
describe the resource ﬂow with preferential allocation in
networks.

At each time, as shown in Fig. 1, resources in each
node are divided into several pieces and then ﬂow to its
neighbors. The amount of each piece is determined by
its neighbors’ degrees. We can regulate the extent of
preference by a tunable parameter α. The equations of
resource ﬂow are

FIG. 1: Resources in node j are divided into several pieces
and then ﬂow to its neighbors. The thicker lines implies there
are more resources ﬂowing. It is worth noting that, in order
to give a clearer illustration we do not plot resource ﬂow into
node j or out of node i.

where Qj→i(t) is the amount of resources moving from
node j to i at time t, sj(t) is the amount of resources
owned by node j at time t, ki is the degree of node i and
N (j) is the set of neighbors of node j. If i and j are not
neighboring, then Qj→i = Qi→j = 0. Meanwhile each
node also get resources from its neighbors, so at time
t + 1 we have for any node i

si(t + 1) =

The mechanism enables each node to distribute all its
resources to its neighbors the same time to get resources
from them, which is reasonable for traﬃc networks and
electric power ones, but appears not well reasonable for
economic networks. However, as often seen, when people
have covered daily expenses, they then deposit the re-
mainder of incomes in banks that in turn make an invest-
ment in proﬁtable areas since money would never make
proﬁts unless it is current in markets. So most money
will be constantly moving from one to another. Thus our
proposed mechanism also applies to economic cases. Be-
side that, such a mechanism is very simple and facilitates
our analysis.

cated to node i, thus it is well reasonable to deﬁne si as
the strength of node i.

where s(k) denotes the average strength over all the
nodes with degree k.

This correlation s(k) ∼ kθ where θ = 1 + α may be
a universal relation between weight and degree in real-
life networks that independent to the degree distribu-
tion. The power-law strength distribution observed in
many real weighted networks can be considered as a re-
sult of the conjunct eﬀect of the above above power-law
correlation and the scale-free property. Obviously, if the
degree distribution in a weighted network obeys the form
P (k) ∼ k−β, then one can immediately obtain the distri-
bution of strength

P (s) ∼ s−γ,

V. SIMULATIONS

VI. CONCLUSION REMARKS

Recent empirical studies in network science show that
many real-life networks display scale-free property [22],
thus we use scale-free networks as the samples. Since
the Barab´asi-Albert (BA) model [23] is the mostly stud-
ied model and lacks structural-biases such as non-zero
degree-degree correlation, we use BA network with size
N = 5000 and average degree hki = 6 for simulations.
The dynamics starts from a completely random distri-
bution of resource. As shown in Fig. 2, we randomly
pick two nodes a and b, and record their strength vs
time sa(t) and sb(t) for three diﬀerent initial conditions.
Clearly, the resource owned by each node will reach a
stable state quickly. And no matter how and where the
one unit resource ﬂow in, the ﬁnal state is the same.

Similar to the mechanism used to judge the weight of
web by Google, the strength of a node is not only deter-
mined by its degree, but also by the strength of its neigh-
bors (see Eq. 7). Although statistically s(k) ∼ k1+α for
uncorrelated networks, the strengths of the nodes with
same degree may be far diﬀerent especially for low-degree
nodes as exhibited in Fig. 3.

In succession, we average the strengths of nodes with
the same degree and plot Fig. 4 verifying our theoreti-
cal analysis that there is a power-law correlation s ∼ kθ
between strength and degree, with exponent θ = 1 + α.
As reported in Fig. 5, the strength also obeys power-
law distribution, as observed in many real-life scale-free
weighted networks. And the simulations agree with ana-

The present model suggests that the power-law corre-
lation between degree and strength arises from the mech-
anism that resources in networks tend to ﬂow to larger
nodes rather than smaller ones. The ﬂow will approaches
to kinetic equilibrium in networks, which is determined
only by topology of the networks, so we successfully pre-
dict weight of a network just from its topology by the
equilibrium state. On the other hand, our proposed
mechanism can well apply to estimation of behaviors in
many networks. When given topology of a traﬃc net-
work, people can easily predict traﬃc load in individual
nodes and links by using this model, so that this model
may be helpful to a better design of traﬃc networks.

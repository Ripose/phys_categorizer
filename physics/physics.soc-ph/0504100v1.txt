Abstract

The deﬁnition of time is still an open question when one deals with

high frequency time series. If time is simply the calendar time, prices

can be modeled as continuous random processes and values resulting

from transactions or given quotes are discrete samples of this underly-

ing dynamics. On the contrary, if one takes the business time point of

view, price dynamics is a discrete random process, and time is simply

the ordering according which prices are quoted in the market. In this

paper we suggest that the business time approach is perhaps a better

way of modeling price dynamics than calendar time. This conclusion

comes out from testing probability densities and conditional variances

predicted by the two models against the experimental ones. The data

set we use contains the DEM/USD exchange quotes provided to us

by Olsen & Associates during a period of one year from January to

December 1998. In this period 1,620,843 quotes entries in the EFX

system were recorded.

Introduction

In the high-frequency arena there are two main-streams about modeling the

stochastic properties of quotes. The ﬁrst approach is to consider quotations

as sampled values of an underlying continuous-time random process [6], [7].

Sampling is itself a random operation, thus introducing a twofold uncertainty

in the price determination [5], [11]. In this framework, time in the model

ﬂows continuously, and is called calendar time.

In the second approach, quoted prices are modeled through a discrete-time

stochastic process [12]; in this setting, time is just the natural total order

relation among quotations, and it is iso-morphic with the set of non-negative

integers (being time 0, the time associated to the ﬁrst considered quotation).

This is the business time approach, and randomness only enters in the

determination of prices. It should be pointed out, however, that the waiting

times between two quotes are also random quantities, but they are assumed

to not contribute to the price determination process.

Whether a calendar-time or a business-time framework should be adopted

in modeling the stochastic nature of ﬁnancial quotes, has been a longly de-

bated issue by the ﬁnance research community, and it clearly depends on

many factors, like, for example: a) adherence to the physical behavior of

reported prices, b) usefulness in terms of a theory to be developed, and c)

last but not least, a matter of taste. See, for example [1], [9], [2].

In this paper, we suggest that business time is perhaps a better tool for

modeling the asset dynamics than calendar-time. In order to support our

claim, we consider: 1) returns corresponding to a given calendar time lag

and any business time lag, 2) returns corresponding to the same calendar

time lag but having a ﬁxed business time lag. We ﬁnd out that their statis-

tical properties are diﬀerent consistently with the business hypothesis and

inconsistently with the calendar one.

In practice, we estimate some vari-

ances and some probability densities whose behavior is diﬀerent in the two

scenarios.

The dataset we use contains the DEM/USD exchange quotes taken from

Reuters’ EFX pages (the dataset having been supplied by Olsen & Asso-

ciates) during a period of one year from January to December 1998.

In

this period 1,620,843 quotes entries in the EFX system were recorded. The

dataset provides a continuously updated sequence of bid and ask exchange

quotation pairs from individual institutions whose names and locations are

also recorded. The reason for using FX data is that this market is not sub-

ject to any working time restriction; in fact, it is open 24 hours a day, seven

days a week. This is in contrast to stock markets, where artiﬁcial time reg-

ulation would have made more diﬃcult, if not impossible, to ﬁnd out the

results outlined in this paper.

2 Business time vs Calendar Time

2.1 Calendar Time

In the calendar time framework, prices are modeled as continuous-time ran-
dom processes. Clearly, market quotes are not deﬁned for every t ∈ R, but
only at discrete intervals, whose extensions in time are called calendar lags

(usually ranging from 2sec. to several minutes, sometimes hours). Never-

theless, according to the calendar time picture, prices are usually considered

as discrete samples of an underlying continuous-time random process.

The model of price dynamics in calendar time therefore has the following

structure:

S(t + ∆) = S(t)eR∆(t)

(1)

where S(t) and S(t + ∆) are the spot prices at times t and t + ∆, ∆ is an
arbitrary calendar time lag and R∆(t) is the aggregated return of prices over
the time interval [t, t + ∆].

Considering a framework where prices evolve over the calendar time, it

is generally assumed that quotes result from a random sampling at times

t0, . . . tn of the continuous-time underlying process S(t). In a pure calendar
time framework such a random sampling is uncorrelated with the process

S(t) itself. We observe however that this is only valid as an approximation;

indeed, several studies have shown a weak correlation between the sequence

of lags and that of returns, among which we cite [10].

The last assumption usually made in order to complete the model de-

scription in the calendar time setting is that the variance of R∆(t) is a linear
function of the calendar time lag ∆, i.e.:

V ar[R∆(t)] = σ2∆

(2)

If the logarithm of S(t) has independent increments the above equation ob-

viously holds and σ is the constant volatility. However, it is well known that

independence does not hold because of volatility clustering which is due to

the correlation of the absolute values of returns[8]. As a consequence, in

spite of a constant volatility, one has a time dependent volatility. Neverthe-
less, the above behavior of the variance still holds true but σ2 is now the

average of the squared volatility. For our purposes we only assume that the

above equality holds and we do not need of speciﬁc assumptions concerning

volatility behavior.

Let us deﬁne the process M (t) as follows:

M (t + ∆) = M (t) + M∆(t)

(3)

where M∆(t) represents the number of given quotes (samples) in the interval
[t, t+∆]. Clearly, M (t) is a non-decreasing random process assuming integer

values. We also observe that M (t) as a function of t is piecewise constant,

and its value increases by one each time a quote is given (i.e. at times

t0, . . . tn).

Given the assumptions made so far, it follows that the process M and the

process S are mutually independent. Hence, it follows that the probability

density of returns corresponding to a calendar time lag ∆ is insensitive from

the condition that M∆(t) is also ﬁxed to a value m. In symbols:

P [R∆(t)|M∆(t) = m] = P [R∆(t)]

and, in particular, the associated variance exhibits the same insensitiveness:

V ar[R∆(t)|M∆(t) = m] = V ar[R∆(t)] = σ2∆

Therefore, we can summarize the calendar time hypothesis as follows:

Hypothesis H1: The asset prices evolve over calendar time, i.e. according

to the model in Eq. (1) and Eq. (2) holds. Moreover the processes S and M

are mutually independent, therefore Eq. (4) and Eq. (5) hold.

Let us anticipate that the main argument of the paper is based on the

estimation of the quantities in Eq. (4) and Eq. (5). We will show with

enough evidence that the two equalities are largely violated in a way which,

on the contrary, is consistent with the business framework.

2.2 Business Time

In the business-time approach, price dynamics is modeled as a discrete-time

random process. Indeed, the time basis is the ordered sequence of times at

(4)

(5)

which prices are quoted in the markets. It is therefore a set isomorphic with

the set of non-negative integers. In such a framework the statistic model of

price dynamics in the business-time framework is the following:

S(n + m) = eRm(n)S(n)

(6)

where S(n) and S(n + m) are the asset price at business times n and n + m

while Rm(n) is the aggregated return over m consecutive quotes. It is then

clear that the only time-dependence aﬀecting the price process is based on

the global ordering of events while the return is independent from calendar

lag. Notice that we refer to m as the business time lag as opposed to the

calendar time lag ∆ introduced in the previous section.

Considering the price dynamics in a business time setting naturally leads

to the following assumption:

V ar[Rm(n)] = ˆσ2m

(7)

whose motivation is the same of that provided for the analogous assumption

in the calendar time hypothesis. We also deﬁne the random process:

T (n + m) = T (n) + Tm(n)

where T (n) is the stochastic calendar time at business time n and Tm(n)
corresponds to the calendar lag T (n + m) − T (n), i.e. the time elapsed from

T (n) after the occurrence of m consecutive quotes. It can be readily seen

that there is a direct connection between T (n) and the process M (t) deﬁned

in the previous subsection. In fact, M (t) = n with t ∈ [T (n), T (n + 1)), and,

moreover, the following relation holds:

MTm(n)(T (n)) = m

for an arbitrary positive integer m.

Given the assumption of statistical

independence between S(n) and

T (n), for a generic ∆ the following relation holds:

P [Rm(n)|Tm(n) ∈ [∆ − ǫ, ∆ + ǫ]] = P [Rm(n)]

(8)

where ǫ is a ﬁxed quantity. The above equation states that the probability

density of returns corresponding to a business time lag m is insensitive to

the condition that the calendar time lag is also ﬁxed to a value around ∆.

In particular we have for the variance:

V ar[Rm(n)|Tm(n) ∈ [∆ − ǫ, ∆ + ǫ]] = V ar[Rm(n)] = ˆσ2m

(9)

which is the business time analogue of Eq. (5).

Given all the assumptions made so far, we are ready to formulate the

hypothesis of prices dynamics in a business time setting.

Hypothesis H2: Asset prices follow the model in Eq. (6) and Eq. (7)

holds. Moreover, the processes S and T are independent, it follows that

Eq. (8) and Eq. (9) hold.

Before concluding this preliminary outline of the two basic approaches

used to describe price dynamics (i.e. calendar time & business time) we also

give another important property of some of the quantities involved so far,

which will turn useful in the remaining part of the paper.

With all the positions previously made, let us ﬁrst observe that the following
relation holds: 1

E[M∆(T (n))] = α∆

for a suitable constant α. Simply put, this property states that the expected

value of the number of quotes in an interval ∆ is proportional to ∆ itself.

Finally, considering the composition of the price process in business time

and the process representing the number of quotes in a given calendar time

lag ∆, it can be shown that:

V ar[RM∆(tn)(n)] = ˆσ2E[M∆(T (n))] = ˆσ2α∆

(10)

Thus, in the business time hypothesis, we also expect the variance in (10)

to be proportional to ∆.

As already anticipated, all equalities in this subsection are supported by

the following statistical analysis conﬁrming the validity the business time

framework.

3 Statistical Estimators

In this and next section we carry out some experimental analysis in order to

best ﬁt the description of prices dynamics choosing between the two distinct

possibilities concisely modeled by hypotheses H1 and H2.

1This follows from the stationarity of the process M∆(T (n)).

In particular:

E[M∆(T (n))] does not depend on T (n) so we drop the sub case. Moreover, E[Mk∆] =

kE[M∆], since the average number of quotes in k intervals of the same length sums up to
k times the value for the single interval, from which the proportionality follows.

In this section, in particular, we will deﬁne some statistical estimators,

i.e. functions of the data contained in high frequency time series, and relate

them to their probabilistic counterparts deﬁned in the previous section.

Our dataset refers to the FX ratio USD/DM over the whole year 1998

and the price Si we consider in this paper is the half sum of bid and ask
(mid-price) while ti denote the time at which the i-th price is given. Some

automatic ﬁltering procedure is also applied, to remove erroneous recording,

which we are able to individuate since they correspond to prices macroscop-

ically diﬀerent from previous and subsequent ones.

Let R = {ri}i=0,1,...,L be the series of elementary returns ri deﬁned as:

ri = log

i = 0, 1, . . . , L

Si+1
Si

and let T = {τi}i=0,1,...,L be the series of temporal lags deﬁned as: τi =
ti+1 − ti.

Now consider the series R(∆, m) = {ri(∆, m)}i=0,1,...,L(∆,m); the ri(∆, m)
are obtained by summing m consecutive elementary returns (where m is

ﬁxed) and subsequently retaining only the L(∆, m) sums corresponding to

a lag in the interval [∆ − ǫ, ∆ + ǫ] (i.e. the sum of the corresponding m

elementary lags τi is in the interval [∆ − ǫ, ∆ + ǫ], where ǫ is also a ﬁxed

quantity).

The mean and variance of such a series are respectively deﬁned as:

µ(∆, m) =

ri(∆, m)

L(∆,m)

i=1
L(∆,m)

i=1

v(∆, m) =

[ri(∆, m) − µ(∆, m)]2

We observe that v(∆, m) represents an estimation of the quantity V ar[R∆(t)|M∆(t) =
m] for the calendar time model; and, as pointed out before, we expect it to

be a linear function of ∆, should hypothesis H1 be correct. Moreover, in

this hypothesis, we expect this variance to be constant with respect to m if

∆ is ﬁxed.

Alternatively, considering the business time framework, v(∆, m) can also

be seen an estimator of the quantity V ar[Rm(n)|Tm(n) ∈ [∆ − ǫ, ∆ + ǫ]]
deﬁned in Eq. (7); should hypothesis H2 be correct we expect, given m, that

v(∆, m) is approximately constant with respect to ∆. Moreover, in this

hypothesis, we expect this variance to be linear in m even if ∆ is ﬁxed.

With the same set of data R(∆, m) we can can compute the empirical

pdf of returns with ﬁxed ∆ and with ﬁxed m. This pdf is an estimator of

P [R∆(t)|M∆(t) = m] and also of P [Rm(n)|Tm(n) ∈ [∆ − ǫ, ∆ + ǫ]].

Consider now the series R(∆) = {ri(∆)}i=0,1,...,L(∆) obtained from R
by summing consecutive elementary returns until the corresponding lag be-

comes equal or greater than ∆. The number of the elements of this series is

L(∆) and the mean and variance are respectively deﬁned as:

µ(∆) =

ri(∆)

L(∆)

L(∆)

L(∆)

X
i=1
L(∆)

X
i=1

v(∆) =

[ri(∆) − µ(∆)]2

In the calendar time framework, v(∆) estimates the quantity V ar[R∆(t)],
deﬁned in Eq. (2). In the business time case, instead, v(∆) estimates the
quantity V ar[RM∆(tn)(n)] in Eq. (10). In both cases we expect this quantity
to grow linearly with ∆.

With the same set of data R(∆) we can can compute the empirical pdf

of returns with ﬁxed ∆ (any m). This pdf is an estimator of P [R∆(t)].

4 The choice of the correct model from data anal-

ysis

We have now suﬃcient information in order to accept or discard hypothesis

H1 and H2, as a result of an empirical data analysis.

First, we have computed the statistical estimators v(∆) and v(∆, m =

40) as deﬁned in the previous section and both plotted in Fig. 1 for diﬀer-

ent values of the calendar time lag ∆.

It can be readily seen that while

v(∆) varies linearly with ∆, the quantity v(∆, m) is approximately con-

stant.

Indeed, a linear ﬁt was computed in the ﬁrst case resulting in

v = 6.16E − 10∆ + 8.26E − 8 and a constant ﬁt in the second resulting

in v = 4.83E − 7.

We recall that, according to the calendar time hypothesis the two lines

should be equal and proportional to ∆, while in the business time case the

former should be proportional to ∆, while the latter should be constant.

The corresponding graphs in ﬁg. 1 seem to suggest that the business time

model is more likely valid, while the hypothesis of calendar time dynamics

Figure 1: We plot here the statistical estimators v(∆) (+ symbols) and v(∆, m) with
m = 40 (× symbols) for diﬀerent values of the calendar time lag ∆. It can be readily seen
that while v(∆) varies linearly with ∆, the quantity v(∆, m) is approximately constant.
Therefore, if the business time lag is ﬁxed (at m = 40), the variance of the returns does

not scale with time lag ∆. This would indicate that business time lag rather than calendar

time lag forms the important independent variable. A linear ﬁt was computed in the ﬁrst
case resulting in v = 6.16E − 10∆ + 8.26E − 8
in v = 4.83E − 7.

Figure 2: We plot here the statistical estimator v(∆, m) with a ﬁxed ∆ = 1000 ± 50

seems to be unlikely. The same kind of behavior can be found if one chooses

the value of m in a range between 5 and 100.

In ﬁg. 2 we also plot the statistical estimator v(∆, m) versus m with a

ﬁxed ∆ = 1000±50. According to the calendar time hypothesis this quantity

should be constant while, according to the business time hypothesis , should

grow linearly in m. The behavior is not linear in all range but, anyway,

v(∆, m) grows with respect to m, which also supports the business time

hypothesis. It should be noticed that the choice of other values of the ﬁxed

∆ would not alter this picture.

Second, we consider two distinct series of returns R(∆, m) and R(∆)

(respectively a and b) as deﬁned in the previous section.

Since the minimum lag between two consecutive quotes is equal to 2

seconds in the given database, the two series a and b coincide for ∆ = 2 sec;

formally: R(∆ = 2sec, m = 1) = R(∆ = 2sec).

We have subsequently compared the estimated probability density func-

tions (pdf) for the series a and b and the results are shown in ﬁg. 3.

The ﬁgure is a log-linear plot of diﬀerent probability densities, For ∆ =

2sec the pdf the two cases R(∆ = 2sec) and R(∆ = 2sec, m = 1) exactly

symbols) coincide because of the data set characteristics as explained in the text; the pdf
for R(∆ = 100sec, m = 1) (× symbols) is roughly the same of the ﬁrst two while the
pdf for R(∆ = 100sec) (star symbols) is macroscopically diﬀerent having larger moments.
The signiﬁcance of the plots lies in the fact that if m = 1, then a large calendar time

seems to make no diﬀerence, whereas if m is allowed to vary, then the PDF becomes fat,

due to return aggregation.

100sec we observe a remarkable diﬀerence between the pdf for the series

R(∆ = 100sec, m = 1) and R(∆ = 100sec). The former, in fact, is roughly

the same as R(∆ = 2sec), while the second is fatter (larger moments).

This fact disagrees with Eq. (4) which is a consequence of calendar time

hypothesis. In fact, according to this equation the two pdf corresponding to

R(∆ = 100sec, m = 1) and R(∆ = 100sec) should be equal.

On the contrary, one can immediately see that this result is in accordance

with Eq. (8) and, therefore, with business time hypothesis. In fact, R(∆ =

100sec, m = 1) and R(∆ = 2sec, m = 1) are roughly the same. This

experimental equality simply means that given the value of m returns are

substantially insensitive to ∆ as stated in Eq. (8).

In conclusion, this experimental result provides further evidence that the

correct model should be the one of the process evolving over business time

(hypothesis H2).

5 Conclusions

In this paper we suggest that the business time approach is perhaps a better

way of modeling price dynamics than calendar time. In order to derive some

insight from data we neglect possible autocorrelation between returns and

possible autocorrelation between lags assuming implicitly that they would

only give a second order correction to our ﬁndings. With this simpliﬁcation

our results altogether seem to provide enough evidence for the rejection of

hypothesis H1 (calendar time model) and the acceptance of hypothesis H2

(business time model). Nevertheless, it should be noticed that hypothesis

H1 assumes that the sampling process is independent of the price evolution.

Therefore, our results do not rule out the continuous time model, but rather

they show that the the continuous time model would require correlations

between processes M and S to in order to ﬁt the data.

The deep reason of the behavior we point out in this paper is that when

an asset (at least a forex asset) is not traded, the prices evolution is slow

while the evolution is fast when the asset is heavily traded. A faster evolution

corresponds to a larger volatility in calendar time [3, 4], therefore, one could

even maintain the calendar point of view, but in this case it should accept

a seasonal modulation of volatility. The fact that the evolution of a price is

slow when there are few transactions is very well known to practitioners but

it is still not accepted in its extremal consequence that prices are frozen when

assets are not traded at all. This is because this behavior is in contrast to

the stock market experience where opening prices are diﬀerent from previous

night closing prices. Nevertheless the diﬀerence between the two markets

is not astonishing if one thinks that the stock market is artiﬁcially time

regulated, while the forex exchange market is an over the counter (OTC)

market not subject to any time restriction.

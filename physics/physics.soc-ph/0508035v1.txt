Modelling Aging Characteristics in Citation Networks

Kamalika Basu Hajra and Parongama Sen
Department of Physics, University of Calcutta, 92 Acharya Prafulla Chandra Road, Kolkata 700009, India.

Growing network models with preferential attachment dependent on both age and degree are
proposed to simulate certain features of citation network noted in [1]. In this directed network, a
new node gets attached to an older node with the probability ∼ K(k)f (t) where the degree and
age of the older node are k and t respectively. Several functional forms of K(k) and f (t) have been
considered. The desirable features of the citation network can be reproduced with K(k) ∼ k−β and
f (t) ∼ exp(αt) with β = 2.0 and α = −0.2 and with simple modiﬁcations in the growth scheme.

I. INTRODUCTION

The citation patterns of scientiﬁc publications form a
rather complex network. Here the nodes are published
papers and a link is formed if one paper cites another
paper published previously. In [2] the citation distribu-
tion of 783, 339 papers cataloged by Institute of Scientiﬁc
Information (ISI) and also the 24, 296 papers published
in Physical Review D (PRD) between 1975 and 1994 was
studied.
It was found that the probability P (k) that
a particular paper is cited k times follows a power law
distribution P (k) ∼ k−γ with exponent γ = 3, indicat-
ing that the incoming degree distribution of the citation
network is scale-free. Later these studies were extended
[3] to the outgoing degree distributions as well, and it
was shown that it has an exponential tail in most cases.

The citation distribution provides an interesting plat-
form for theoretical modelling when the various features
of citation dynamics are taken into account. It must be
kept in mind that citation is possible only to papers that
have been published previously, i.e, older papers, so that
the network is directed. Also since most of the papers
are gradually forgotten or become irrelevant, the proba-
bility that a particular paper is cited should decrease in
time unless it is of utmost importance. Again, a young
paper, which is undergoing recognition, gains increasing
attention through citations. Hence the model of a cita-
tion network should be one in which aging of the papers
occur such that the probability of a paper getting cited
depends on its age. Again, from the scale-free nature of
the degree distribution, it appears that the probability
of a paper being cited at a given time is proportional to
its in-degree.

The distribution of ages of cited papers was studied
for small sample sizes in [4] and [5] and the results from
these two studies did not agree. The complete set of cita-
tions for all publications in Physical Review (PR) jour-
nals from July 1893 to June 2003 was later studied in
[1] which perhaps gives the closest possible picture of the
citation scenario.

Among the various features of a citation network, those
which are relevant to the present paper are listed below:
(i) the distribution T (t) of ages t of citations to other
publications: this is calculated from the diﬀerence of the
year of publication of a particular paper and the year of
publication of the papers which are cited by it.
(ii) the distribution R(t) of citation ages t from citing
publications calculated from the diﬀerence of the year of
publication of a particular paper and the year of publi-
cation of the papers citing it.

Fig. 1 shows pictorially how the two distributions are

generated.

FIG. 1. The two age distributions from a citation network.
In I, the paper published at time t0 cites several papers pub-
lished at diﬀerent times t1, t2 etc. The distribution of the
intervals (t0 − ti) gives T (t). In II, the paper published at
time t0 is cited by papers published at times t1, t2 etc. The
distribution of the intervals (ti − t0) gives R(t).

(iii) The correlation of the average age of citing pa-
pers as a function of the degree k of that paper: this is
denoted by A(k). It is expected that for a paper with
many citations the average age of the citations will also
be large such that there is a positive correlation between
the two.

For T (t) it was found that in the range of 2 to 15 years,

1

the distribution decays exponentially with time, while for
longer times the decay is a slower exponential. For R(t),
over the limited range of 2 to 20 years, the integrated data
is consistent with a power law decay with an exponent
∼ −1. Hence, authors tend to have an exponentially de-
caying memory while citing papers, but the citation age
distribution to a particular paper has a slower power law
decay over an initial period of time (lifetime of the pa-
per). The PR data showed that there is indeed a positive
correlation between average citation age and the number
of times that a paper has been cited (property (iii)) and
the relation is consistent with a power law.

In the present paper we have attempted to obtain a
suitable model for the citation network such that it may
reproduce some of the main results that were obtained
from the study of real citation networks. In section II, we
give a brief review of time dependent networks, where we
discuss the results of some earlier works. In section III,
the results for R(t) from the known models are discussed
and we ﬁnd that these models are not appropriate for the
citation network. In section IV, we propose a modiﬁed
model which can reproduce some of the real results to
an appreciable extent. Finally in section V, we provide
a summary and also the conclusions of the present work.

II. BRIEF REVIEW OF MODELS OF AGING
NETWORKS

The question of time dependence in the attachment
probability of the incoming nodes in a growing network
has been studied in a few theoretical models [4,6,7].
These models have basically evolved from the original
Barabasi-Albert (BA) model [8] where in a growing net-
work model, a new node gets linked to the existing ones
following a preferential attachment to nodes with larger
degree. In the time dependent models, a new node gets
attached to older nodes with a preferential attachment
which is dependent on the degree as well as the age of the
existing node. We discuss brieﬂy below some relevant
age dependent models and the results thereof.

In general, in all the models of aging networks, the
attachment probability Π(k, t) is taken to be a separable
function of the degree k and the age t of the existing node
such that

Π(k, t) = K(k)f (t).

(1)

In the Dorogovtsev-Mendes (DM) model [6], K(k) = k
and f (t) = tα were considered.

In this model the degree distribution was found to be
scale free for values of α ≥ −1. For α < 0, the age de-
pendence presents a competing eﬀect to the preferential
attachment, but for α > 0, the older nodes get richer,

enhancing the ’rich gets richer’ eﬀect.

In [4] an exponential decaying function f (t) = exp(αt)
was chosen and it was found that the model is not scale-
free for any negative value of α.

In [7], the DM model was further generalised by in-
corporating a power law variation of the degree in the
attachment probability Π,

Π(k, t) ∼ kβtα.

(2)

A phase diagram was obtained for this model in the α−β
plane, with the phase boundary dividing the phase space
into the small world and regular network regions. Scale
free behaviour was found to exist only along a line for
β ≥ 1. In the small world region, there was gel forma-
tion beyond β = 1, while the degree distribution was
stretched exponential for β < 1, α ≤ −1.

III. R(T) FROM STANDARD MODELS

Evidently a time dependent model would be appropri-
ate for the citation network. One can immediately realise
that the time dependent part f (t) of the preferential at-
tachment probability (1) is analogous to the function T (t)
deﬁned in section I. The task is to investigate whether as-
suming an exponential decay in T (t) (i.e., (f (t)) gives us
the proper behaviour of R(t).

In our theoretical model, we ﬁrst take two standard
forms of time dependence in Π(k, t) and look at the be-
haviour of the corresponding R(t) using a numerical sim-
ulation. The decay of f (t) is assumed to be (a) power
law and (b) exponential. The choice of a power law be-
haviour in the attachment probability may be regarded as
of theoretical interest mainly as T (t) has been observed
to have an exponential decay [9]. However, the power law
model is quite well studied and it may be useful to get
the results from both models and compare them with the
real data. We also use a power law dependence of K(k)
on k.

The degree distribution has already been studied for
most of these models. Therefore we are primarily inter-
ested in calculating R(t), which is related to the degree
distribution when its average is under consideration.

In our simulations we have generated networks with
2000 nodes and 10000 conﬁgurations for the power law
time dependence of the attachment probability, while for
the exponential time dependence, we have used a maxi-
mum of 3000 nodes and 5000 conﬁgurations.

Let the ith node born at time τi get R(τ, τi) links at
time τ . We are interested in the behaviour of R(τ, τi) as
a function of the corresponding age τ − τi = t. It may be
noted that the cumulative sum

Rcum(τ, τi) = Στ

FIG. 2. R(t) vs t are shown for β = 0.5, 1 and 2. In ﬁgs 2a
and 2b, the variations are shown for α = 0, −0.5, −1.0. Here,
the variation is power law at large values of t only. For β = 2,
variations are shown for α = −0.5 and −1.0. Here however,
R(t) behaves diﬀerently; a power law variation exists for early
t and dies out very soon to a saturation value (ﬁg 2c).

For β = 0.5 once again we obtained a similar varia-
tion of R(t). Power law regions might exist for α = −0.5
and −1.0 with exponents ∼ 0.8, 1.0 respectively. How-
ever, β < 1 may not be a very interesting region as it has
already been found that there is no scale-free behaviour
here.

For β = 2 behaviour of R(t) changes: there is ap-
parently a power law region with exponent ∼ 0.7 during
early times and later it becomes a constant. The later be-
haviour is not consistent with the citation results where
R(t) decays rapidly for large t. These results for the three
diﬀerent β are shown in Fig. 2.

where R(x) has a power law growth for large x, e.g.,
R(x) ∝ x1−ρ (ρ < 1).
In more complicated models,
e.g., accelerated models [10], Rcum(τ, τi) may have a non-
trivial dependence on both τ and τi. In any case, as a
function of t, Rcum will have a strong τi dependence. For
the distribution of the ages of citing papers, we there-
fore ﬁnd it more convenient to tag an arbitrary node and
study the number of links R(t) it gets as a function of
t suppressing the index τi. The price we pay for this is
that since there is no averaging there is greater ﬂuctua-
tion. The node we tag also has to be an early one such
that data over a long period is obtainable.

III.I Scheme(a): In the ﬁrst scheme, the attachment
probability is given by Π(k, t) ∼ kβtα. We have simu-
lated the network for β = 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 and diﬀerent
values of α ≤ 0. Throughout the simulations, we have
tagged node number 10 (the results do not change if we
change this number keeping it an early node). The β = 1
case corresponds to the DM model. From the behaviour
of Rcum(τ, 10) here, one can guess that R(t) will have a
form

R(t) ∝ (

t + 10
10

−ρ.
)

(5)

This behaviour is observed for large values of t and the
agreement becomes worse as α becomes more negative.
We are more interested in the small t behaviour here,
which turn out to be far from a power law.

3

III.2. Scheme (b): The attachment probability for the

second scheme is given by

Π(k, t) ∼ kβ exp(αt).

(6)

In [1] and [4] the behaviour of T (t) was found to be ex-
ponentially decaying. We have therefore taken a model
with f (t) = exp(αt) with α < 0. We have also gener-
alised the model of [4] to include a nonlinear functional
dependence of Π(k, t) on k. This is because the β = 1
case showed that there is no scale free region for negative
α. A scale free region may only be obtained for values of
β > 1 when α < 0.

In this case, power law is not obtained anywhere for
R(t). For each value of β, we show in Fig. 3 R(t) for
α = −0.1 and −0.2 (these values are comparable to the
observed values).

IV. A MODIFIED MODEL: R(T) AND OTHER
RESULTS

We are in search of a minimal model and ﬁnd that the
simple models described in the previous section are not
suﬃcient. To add more features, we note that there are
many diﬀerences between these models and a real cita-
tion network, prominent among which are the following
(i) In these models, only one paper is being cited by each
paper
(ii) In each year, it is being assumed in these models that
only one paper is being published. (Note that the unit
of time for the real data had been 1 year).
Both these are gross simpliﬁcations and the real network
is quite diﬀerent.

In order to make the smallest changes, we incorporate
suitable modiﬁcations in the models described in section
III such that only one of the two factors mentioned is con-
sidered at a time. This way, it will be also be clear which
are the indispensible features of the citation network.

We take the exponential model where the attachment
probability is given by (6) because we wish to proceed
with a model in which the time dependent part in the at-
tachment probability has an exponential decay to mimic
reality.

Keeping everything else same, when each new node is
allowed to have more than one citation (typically 10 or
20) we ﬁnd that there is no signiﬁcant change in the be-
haviour of R(t).

Next, again sticking to the exponential model with one
citation, we consider M number of publications each year
(M > 1). In the simulation, this means we are putting
the time label diﬀerently, the ﬁrst M nodes have τi = 1,
the next M nodes τi = 2 etc. With M = 20, we ﬁnd that
the behaviour of R(t) is indeed a power law for t ≤ 20,
when the value of β = 2 and α = −0.1, −0.2 with an
exponent ρ = 1.4 ± 0.1. (Fig. 4). Decreasing the value
of β, the power law behaviour worsens. There maybe
some optimum values of β and α for which the value of
the exponent ρ is closer to the observed 0.94 [1] or some
more modiﬁcations of the basic model maybe required
to achieve a better quantitative agreement. Our present
objective is not to obtain precise values but rather to
obtain the simplest possible model that has an exponen-
tially decaying f (t) giving a power law decay in R(t).

For the exponential time dependence in Π(k, t), once
again we study R(t), the age distribution of the cita-

Once we have achieved the primary goal, it is impor-
tant to ﬁnd out the behaviour of the degree distribution

beta = 2 ; M = 20

alpha = -0.1,-0.2

slope = -3.0

P (k) and the correlation between average age of citations
A(k) to a paper and its degree k. Here we ﬁnd that A(k)
has a power law type increase as has been observed in
[1] when M = 20 for β = 2 and α = −0.2. For M = 1,
which corresponds to the model described in III.2, it is
deﬁnitely not a power law (Fig. 6). Hence at least two
features of the present model are consistent with the ob-
servations of [1].

Lastly, we check the degree distribution. For a few
initial decades of k, it does give a fairly good agreement
with a power law decay of the form P (k) ∼ k−γ with
γ = 3. However, there is a increase in P (k) for very large
k values which indicates a tendency to form a gel (Fig.
5). In fact, the curvature of P (k) is opposite to that of
the observed distribution reported in [2,3]. The possible
reasons for this departure from reality is discussed brieﬂy
in the next section.

V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

We have attempted to construct a simple model for ci-
tation network in which the evolution rule is formulated
according to the behaviour of real citation data.

Since aging is an important factor in citation data, our
emphasis has been on the age distribution of references
made by a paper T (t) and made to a paper R(t). The
interesting observation was that R(t) has a power law
decay for early t while T (t) has an exponential decay,
which is rather counter-intuitive. Indeed, the standard
aging network models fail, but simple modiﬁcation of the
exponential model is able to reproduce the correct be-
haviour of R(t), at least qualitatively.

It is in general not quite easy to construct a single
model of citation network which can reproduce all its
features [3,11]. This may be due to certain distinctive
features of the citation network of which we mention a
few below.

(i) Apart from mathematical quantities like the degree
and age of a paper, the content of a paper is also impor-
tant. Evidently a paper on a topic where a large number
of people work, will get more citations ( that can be quan-
tiﬁed by the impact parameter of a paper).
(ii) Neither the number of citations nor the number of
papers published each year remains constant.
(iii) In the models, one assumes smooth behaviour, e.g.,
of T (t) while in reality the variations are non-monotonic.
(iv) There is a possibility of ”death” of a papers, or the
separate existence of dead and live papers as referred to
in [12].

In our modiﬁed model, although we have obtained
good agreement of the behaviour of R(t) and A(k), but
for P (k) the behaviour does not agree very well with the
observations. This may be because we have not opti-
mised the values of β and α to get better agreement with

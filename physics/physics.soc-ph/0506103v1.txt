Abstract

Within the description of stochastic diﬀerential equations it is argued that the existence of

Boltzmann-Gibbs type distribution in economy is independent of the time reversal symmetry in

econodynamics. Both power law and exponential distributions can be accommodated by it. The

demonstration is based on a mathematical structure discovered during a study in gene regulatory

network dynamics. Further possible analogy between equilibrium economy and thermodynamics

is explored.

INTRODUCTION

Carefully and extensive analysis of real economic and ﬁnancial data have revealed vari-

ous exponential and power-law distributions regarding to money, income, wealth, and other

economic quantities in ancient and modern social societies [1, 2, 3, 4]. A remarkable anal-

ogy between the economic system and a thermodynamical system has been revealed in a

recent study [4]. Using a detailed microdynamical model with time reversal symmetry, it

was demonstrated that a Boltzmann-Gibbs type distribution exists in economic systems.

Indeed, ample empirical analysis support such suggestion [4, 5]. Nevertheless, diﬀerent mi-

crodynamical models lead to apparently diﬀerent distributions [3, 4]. Those distributions

are supported by empirical data, too. The nature of such diﬀerence may reveal the diﬀer-

ence in corresponding economic structure. For example, this diﬀerence has been tentatively

attributed to the role played by time reversal symmetry in microdynamical models [4].

Following the tradition of synthesizing interdisciplinary knowledge, such as from biology,

physics, and ﬁnance [6], in this letter we argue that irrespective of the time reversal symmetry

the Boltzmann-Gibbs type distribution always exists. A broader theoretical base is thus

provided. The demonstration is performed within the framework of stochastic diﬀerential

equations and is based on a novel mathematical structure discovered during a recent study in

gene regulatory network dynamics [7]. In the light of thermodynamical description, possible

explanations for the origin of the diﬀerence in various empirical distributions are proposed.

II. BOLTZMANN-GIBBS DISTRIBUTION IN FINANCE

Stochastic diﬀerential equations or Langevin equations and their corresponding Fokker-

Planck equations have been shown to be a useful modelling tool in economy [1, 2, 8, 9]. One

of the best examples is the Black-Scholes formula in option pricing theory [8]. This kind

of mathematical formulation provides a direct connections between the microdynamics and

the stationary state and has been used to generate various distribution laws [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

Speciﬁcally, the stochastic diﬀerential equation may take the following form:

˙q = f(q) + NI(q)ξ(t) ,

(1)

where f and q are n-dimensional vectors and f a nonlinear function of the state variable q.

The state variable is the quantity to specify the economic system. It may be the money,

2

the income, or other suitable indices. The noise ξ is a standard Gaussian white noise with l
independent components: hξii = 0, hξi(t)ξj(t′)i = 2δijδ(t − t′), and i, j = 1, 2, ..., l. In Eq.(1)

we explicitly factorize out the pure noise source and the state variable dependent part for

the convenient of later description.

following matrix equation

The speciﬁcation of the noise in Eq.(1) is through the n × n diﬀusion matrix D(q) by the

NI(q)N τ

I (q) = ǫ D(q) ,

(2)

where NI is an n × l matrix, N τ

I is its the transpose, and ǫ a nonnegative numerical constant

to keep tract of the noise. It plays the role of temperature in thermodynamics. According to

Eq.(2) the n × n diﬀusion matrix D is both symmetric and nonnegative. For the dynamics

of state variable q, all what needed from the noise is the diﬀusion matrix D. Hence, it is

not necessary to require the dimension of the noise vector ξ be the same as that of the state

vector q and to require more speciﬁc knowledge of n × l matrices {NI} beyond Eq.(2).

It is known that even in situations that Eq.(1) is not an exact description, and perhaps it

would never be in a rigorous sense in economy, it may still serve as the ﬁrst approximation

for further modelling [1, 2]. Indeed, it has been empirically veriﬁed to be a rather accurate

description in economy [8, 9, 10, 11]. Because the energy function or Hamiltonian has played

a dominant role in equilibrium physics processes, the crucial question is whether or not a

similar quantity exists in a more general setting. In the following we present an argument

leading to the positive answer.

There exists several ways to deal with the stochastic equations equation in the form

of Eq.(1) and (2). The most commonly used are those of Ito and Stratonovich methods

[1, 2, 12]. However, with those methods the connection between the existence of energy

function like quantity in Eq.(1) and the stationary distribution is not clear when the time

reversal symmetry is broken [12]. The diﬃculty for ﬁnding such potential function can be
illustrated by the fact that usually D−1(q)f(q) cannot be written as the gradient of a scalar

function [12] in the absence of detailed balance condition or in the broken time reversal

symmetry. This will become precise as we proceed.

During a recent study of the robustness of the genetic switch in a living organism [7], it

was discovered that Eq.(1) can be transformed into the following form,

[A(q) + C(q)] ˙q = ∂qφ(q) + NII(q)ξ(t) ,

(3)

3

where the noise ξ(t) is from the same source as that in Eq.(1). Here we tentatively name

A(q) the adaptation matrix, C(q) the conservation matrix, and the scalar function φ(q) the

fortune function. The gradient operation in state space is denoted by ∂q. The adaptation

matrix A(q) is deﬁned through the following matrix equation

NII(q)N τ

II(q) = ǫ A(q) ,

(4)

(5)

(6)

which guarantees that A is both symmetric and nonnegative. The n × n conservation matrix

C is antisymmetric. We deﬁne

A(q) + C(q) = 1/[D(q) + Q(q)] ≡ M(q) .

with the n × n matrix M is the solution of following two matrix equations [13]. The ﬁrst

equation is the potential condition

∂q × [M(q)f(q)] = 0 ,

which gives n(n − 1)/2 conditions [the wedge product for two arbitrary vectors v1 and v2

in n-dimension: [v1 × v2]ij = v1iv2j − v1jv2i , i, j = 1, 2, ..., n ]. The second equation is the

generalized Einstein relation between the adaptation and diﬀusion matrices in the presence

of conservation matrix

M(q)D(q)M τ (q) =

[M(q) + M τ (q)] .

1
2

which gives n(n + 1)/2 conditions [13]. The fortune function φ(q) is connected to the

deterministic force f(q) by

∂qφ(q) = M(q)f(q) .

For simplicity we will assume det(A) 6= 0 in the rest of the letter. Hence det(M) 6= 0

[14]. Thus, the adaptation matrix A, the conservation matrix Q and the fortune function

φ in Eq.(3) and (4) can be completely determined by Eq.(1) and (2). The breakdown of

detailed balance condition or the time reversal symmetry is represented by the ﬁniteness of

the conservation matrix

C(q) 6= 0 ,

(7)

or equivalently Q 6= 0. The usefulness of the formulation of Eq.(3) and (4) is already man-

ifested in the successful solution of outstanding stable puzzle in gene regulatory dynamics

[7] and in solving two fundamental controversies in population genetics [15].

4

A few remarks on Eq.(3) are in order.

In the light of classical mechanics in physics,

Eq.(3) is in precisely the form of Langevin equation. The fortune function φ corresponds

to the potential function but opposite in sign to reﬂect the fact that in economy there is a

tendency to seek the peak or maximum of fortune. The adaptive matrix A plays the role

of friction. It represents adaptive dynamics and is the dynamical mechanism to seek the

nearby fortune peak. The conservation matrix C plays the role analogous to a magnetic

ﬁeld. Its dynamics is similar to that of the Lorentz force, hence conserves the fortune. As

in classical mechanics, the ﬁniteness of the conservation matrix C breaks the time reversal

symmetry.

It was heuristically argued [13] and rigorous demonstrated [16] that the stationary dis-

tribution ρ(q) in the state space is, if exists,

ρ(q) ∝ exp

φ(q)

 

ǫ !

.

(8)

(9)

Therefore, the fortune function φ acquires both the dynamical meaning through Eq.(3)

and the steady state meaning through Eq.(8). Speciﬁcally, in the so-called zero-mass limit

to diﬀerentiate from Ito and Stratonovich methods, the Fokker-Planck equation for the

probability distribution ρ(q, t) takes the form [16]

∂tρ(q, t) = ∂τ

qM −1(q)[ǫ∂q − ∂qφ(q)]ρ(q, t) .

Here ∂t is a derivative with respect to time and ∂q represents the gradient operation in state

space. We note that Eq.(8) is a stationary solution to Eq.(9) even it may not be normalizable,

that is, even when the partition function Z =

dnq ρ(q) is ill-deﬁned. Again, we emphasize

R
that no time reversal symmetry is assumed in reaching this result. This completes our

demonstration on the existence of the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution in economy.

Using M −1(q) = D(q) + Q(q) and f(q) = [D(q) + Q(q)]∂qφ(q), Eq.(9) can be rewritten

in a more suggestive form [16]

∂tρ(q, t) = ∂τ

q[ǫD(q)∂q + ǫ(∂τ

qQ(q)) − f(q)]ρ(q, t) .

(10)

It is clear that in the presence of time reversal symmetry, i.e. Q = 0, one can directly read
the fortune function φ from above form of Fokker-Planck equation as ∂qφ(q) = D−1(q)f(q).

For the sake of completeness, we list the Fokker-Placnk equations corresponding to Ito

5

and Stratonovich treatments of Eq.(1) and (2) [12]:

(12)

The connection of fortune function with both dynamical (Eq.(1) and (2)) and stationary

state is indeed not clear in above two equations. Nevertheless, it has been shown [16] that

there are corresponding fortune functions, adaptation and conservation matrices to Eq.(11)

and (12). We point out here that when the matrix NI is independent of state variable,

Eq.(11) and (12) are the same but may still diﬀer from Eq.(9), because the gradient of the

antisymmetric matrix Q(q) may not be zero. This last property shows that the time reversal

symmetry is indeed important.

III. TWO EXAMPLES

The Fokker-Planck equation used by Silva and Yakovenko [5] has the form:

∂tρsy(q, t) = ∂q[a(q) + ∂qb(q)]ρsy(q, t) ,

and Fokker-Planck equation used by Bouchaud and Mezard [3] has the form

∂tρbm(q, t) = ∂q[(J(q − 1) + σ2q + σ2q∂qq]ρbm(q, t) .

They are all in one dimension. We immediately conclude that the conservation matrix C,

equivalently Q, is zero, because there is no conservation matrix in one dimension. In accor-

dance with the deﬁnition in the present letter, which is consistent with that in nonequilibrium

processes [12], the dynamics described by above two equations can be eﬀectively classiﬁed

as time reversal symmetric.

Eq.(10), we have

Rewriting them in symmetric form with respect to the derivative of state variable q as in

∂tρsy(q, t) = ∂q[a(q) + (∂qb(q)) + b(q)∂q]ρsy(q, t) ,

and

∂tρbm(q, t) = ∂q[(J(q − 1) + σ2q + σ2q + σ2q∂q]ρbm(q, t) .

They are exactly what found in Ref.[[5]] and [[3]]: the ﬁrst one corresponds to an exponential

distribution and the second one a power law distribution according to the Boltzmann-Gibbs

distribution Eq.(8).

IV. ENSEMBLES AND STATE VARIABLES

Having deﬁned a precise meaning of time reversal symmetric and have demonstrated that

the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution even in the absence of time reversal symmetry, we explore

further connection between econodynamics and statistical physics.

There are two general types of situations which would generate diﬀerent distributions in

statistical physics and thermodynamics. The ﬁrst one is to link to constraints on the system

under various conditions.

In statistical physics such constraints are described by various

ensembles and free energies. For example, there are canonical and grand-canonical ensem-

bles. There are Gibbs and Helmholtz free energies, entropy, enthalpy, etc. Those ensembles

have their characteristic distributions. It would be interesting to know the corresponding

situations in economy.

Even with a given constraint, the form of distribution depends on the choice of state

variable. For example, for ideal gas model, the distributions are diﬀerent if views from the

kinetic energy and from velocity. Hence, there is a question of appropriate state variable

for a given situation, with which the physics becomes particular transparent.

It would

be interesting to know what be the appropriate variables to describe an economic system.

Within this context, the diﬀerence between what discovered by Dragulecu and Yakovenko

[4] and Bouchaud and Mezard [3] is perhaps more due to the diﬀerence in choices of state

variables, because it seems they are describing the same situation of same system under

same constraints.

7

A remark on terminology is in order.

It was demonstrated above that regardless of

the time reversal symmetry the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution, Eq.(8), exists. The fortune

function φ has an additional dynamical meaning deﬁned in Eq.(3). Both exponential and

power law distribution can be represented by Eq.(8). In fact, it is well known that power

law distributions exist in statistical physics. A nontrivial example is the Kosterlitz-Thouless

transition [17]. Thus it does not appear appropriate to call the power law distribution non-

Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution. Such a terminology confusion was already noticed before

[18].

In the view of the dominant role of entropy in Kosterlitz-Thouless transition [17], the

ubiquitous existence of power law distribution in economy may suggest that the entropy

eﬀect is rather important in econodynamics. This may corroborate with the suggestion of

“superthermal” in economy [5].

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this letter we demonstrate that the existence of Botlzmann-Gibbs distribution in ﬁ-

nance is independent of time reversal symmetry. Both power law and exponential distribu-

tions are within its description. In analogous to similar situation in statistical physics, the

diﬀerences among those distributions discovered empirically in economy are likely the result

of diﬀerent choices of state variables to describe the same system in econodynamics.

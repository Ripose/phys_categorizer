1. Introduction

The debate about concerning changes in scholarly publishing began well before the advent
of the Internet, but it was with widespread use of the World Wide Web that many began
to consider that a big change was behind the corner and that in a few year nothing was
going to be as before [29].

In the late nineties several experiments of online journals emerged to propose new
publishing models to make the most of the new medium. A big emphasis was on the
chance to reduce costs and face the so-called ‘serials crisis”.

The two main sections analyze journal forms (section 3) and peer review (section 4).
The most important content is in the bibliography that contains articles and web sites in
alphabetical order with back references to the text. All web sites have been visited in the
ﬁrst half of august 2006, and almost all web sites references are brieﬂy described.

1.1 Open Access

Open Access is not a goal of this study, but it has something in common with al the
subjects covered here.

It is by far the most frequently discussed issue in specialized and general journals, with
several congresses and journal special issues, not to mention single articles and contribu-
tions.

Just to give an idea we sould mention

• The Open Access Special on the journal Research Information June/July 2006

http://www.researchinformation.info/features junjul06.html.

• SPARC Open Access Newsletter: http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/.

• Nature debate on Open Access

http://www.nature.com/nature/focus/accessdebate/index.html.

• Open Acces Webliography http://dlist.sir.arizona.edu/1005/01/oaw.htm.

• Open Access Bibliography:

liberating scholarly literature with e-prints and open

access journals http://www.digital-scholarship.com/oab/oab.htm.

Hence, Open Access issues and more generally the problem of costs will not be covered

and will be mentioned only when worth doing.

2. The ongoing dabate

The debate is very lilvely and concerns all aspects of scholarly publishing: peer review,
open access, copyright issues, self archiving. It features all kinds of contributions: from
very abstract to the description of existing services.

This debate is going on mainly on a number of dedicated journals like: Learned Pub-
lishing [76], D-Lib Magazine [61], Science & Technology Libraries [93], and the no longer
maintained Journal of Electronic Publishing [71].

Besides these publications, learned societies and big associations are funding research
on the subject. For example the Association of Research Libraries [46] and the Scholarly
Communications Group of JISC [88].

Also many specialized journals are greatly involved. First of all Nature, where articles
on the subject appear very often and a debate on peer review is going on [81] together with
an experiment of open-commentary peer review.

Then journals like BioMed Central [53], JAMA [70] and BMJ [54] often publish con-
tributions on the subject, with a particular attention to the evaluation of their peer review
systems.

It must be noted that great part of the discussion involves the biomedical sector, both
scientists and journals staﬀ, and this is probably due to the high importance those sectors
give to quality controls and results certiﬁcation.

An invaluable resource is the Scholarly Electronic Publishing Bibliography [92] by
Charles W. Bailey Jr., updated at least twice a month, lists article, books and online
resources.

3. The journal form

Unlike peer review, that we will discuss later, the debate on the journal form did not
produce a great amount of statistical and objective studies, mainly because it is not possible

– 2 –

give measurable answers to the basic questions. Do journals work as they are? Do they
need to be modiﬁed?

We could divide the contibutions in this ﬁeld into two categories: theoretical and

experimental.

3.1 Abstract proposals

In this ﬁrst class we can consider articles and studies that devise a revolutionary approach,
without trying it in practice. Such entirely new models of scholarly communication usually
include also a new form of review.

Few authors have tried to examine abstractly what are (and what should be) the

functions played by a journal and which roles are in charge of them.

A very abstract study is the one by B.-C. Bj¨ork [4] that tries to give a formal model
of the scientiﬁc communication process. The model is very detailed and hierarchical and
includes the whole communication chain, from initial research to the assimilation of re-
search results to everyday practice. Although the model treats both informal and formal
communication, as well as the publishing of data, its focus is on modelling the publish-
ing and indexing of traditional peer-reviewed journal articles, and ﬁnding and retrieving
them. New developments enabled by the Internet, such as open access journals and e-print
repositories, are also included.

A comparison with a previous model developed by Garvey and Griﬃth in 1972 [10]
gives an idea of how recent developments added steps and facilities, but also highlighted
the inner structure of processes that in traditional publishing appeared elementary.

A good analysis has been made by Smith [35] who identiﬁes the main roles: editorial,
quality cointrol (content), quality control (form), recognition of work done, marketing,
disseminating; and the hidden roles: subject deﬁning, community deﬁning, archiving.

More simply Van de Sompel et al. [40], based on [33], distinguish the following ﬁve
functions of scholarly communication: Registration, Certiﬁcation, Awareness, Archiving
and Rewarding.

It is also interesting to read Elsevier’s point of view [6] focused on technologies (se-

mantic Web) and publishers’ projects.

The Deconstructed Journal. The ﬁrst important proposal was that of J. Smith [35, 36]
of a Deconstructed Journal. DJ is based on a net of Subject Focal Points (SFP), subject
dedicated portals that link to relevant items in the covered subjects. SFP’s are diﬀerent
from journals in that they don’t own nor host the articles, but point to them oﬀering
organized access and search facilities to subscibers. SFP’s do not organize quality control.

The latter role is played by “evaluator organizations”, that are paid by the author
interested in having his work assessed. Nothing prevents authors having thir work evaluated
by more than one evaluator, and multiple SFP’s can point to the same item.

Archiving would be ensured either by local repositories or by not for proﬁt organisations

like JSTOR [75].

– 3 –

The author view would be: (1) Prepare the article. (2) Place it on a visible server. (3)
Notify one or more evaluator organizations. (4) Revises it in the light of comments. (5)
Notify the relevant SFPs who place it on their recommended list if it is relevant.

Smith claims that this model would solve some well known problems of the traditional
model such as the scattering of information across many journals in the same ﬁeld, easier
publication for unconventional ideas, delays in refereeing.

Two tier journal. Another model has been proposed by Paul Ginsparg [11, 12].

First a minimal, maybe semi-automatic, ﬁlter to access the standard tier. Then a
much smaller set of articles is selected for the full peer-review. The selection can be based
on objective data (citation impact, usage statistics) or user driven (reader nomination or
rating) or editorial. Review, being on a smaller number of articles, could be combined:
traditional, open or closed discussion . . . Standard tier could be made up of institutional
repositories and/or disciplinary archives.

“The system that scholars deserve”.
In the stream of the analysis conducted by Van
de Sompel and colleagues [40, 43], M. Rodriguez [32] proposed a deconstructed publication
model in which the peer review process is mediated by an OAI1-compliant peer-review ser-
vice. This peer-review service uses a social-network algorithm to automatically determine
potential reviewers for a submitted manuscript and for weighting the inﬂuence of each
participating reviewer’s evaluations.

The social-network is based on coauthorship links, and selection of referees for a given
article is made by automatic analysis of the bibliography. All potential reviewers can
submit their comments, and give a score. Average scores are computed with adjusments.
This system could allow also evaluation of the reviewers.

What is very interesting in this system is the selection of reviewers: a similar algorithm

could be adopted also to assist editors in the choice.

The weak point that is common to all theoretical proposals is that they imagine a
change of the system as a whole. Moreover if diﬀerent models are possible then the best
would be to see them coexist, allowing everybody to choose.

3.2 Concrete proposals

Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics. Maybe the most interesting proposal is the
one by U. P¨oschl [30] (see also Koop and P¨oschl in the Nature debate [81]) who devises
a two-stage (or multi-stage) publication processes with interactive peer review and pub-
lic discussion. Its applicability is demonstrated by the open access journal Atmospheric
Chemistry and Physics (ACP) [49]. ACP is a lively journal: many submissions, high impact
factor. It is open access at a modest author-pays fee.2

More in detail. After basic ﬁlter by editor, articles are posted on a child journal called
Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics Discussion, where it is accessible for discussion, during

1Open Archive Initiative, see page 12.
2Very interestingly, not only authors of published papers pay, but all those that are admitted to discus-

sion. This reduces consistently the pay-per-publish fees.

which the referees’ comments (anonymous or attributed), additional short comments by
other members of the scientiﬁc community (attributed) and the authors’ replies are also
published in ACPD. Afterwards, the authors are given a chance to revise their paper, which
is then sent out for expert review, in which the identity of referees is conﬁdential. At this
stage referees are only supposed to return a verdict of ‘pass’ or ‘fail’, as any more detailed
feedback should already have been received during the review period. If accepted, the ﬁnal
revised papers are published in ACP.

ACPD has its own ISSN, articles can be left there also if rejected and can be cited.

Diﬀerent levels journals. The B.E. Journals in Theoretical Economics [51] are three
connected economics journal, with uniﬁed submission.

Each submission will be considered simultaneously by these three quality-rated jour-
nals. A submission will, however, be accepted by at most one of these journals. The
editor, after standard peer review, decides in which of the three journals it would be most
appropriate.

• Advances in Theoretical Economics publishes articles that make signiﬁcant advances;

• Contributions to Theoretical Economics publishes articles that make important con-

tributions to speciﬁc literatures;

• Topics in Theoretical Economics publishes articles of interest to those working on

speciﬁc topics;

A similar system is for The B.E. Journals in Economic Analysis & Policy (4 journals

in one) and The B.E. Journals in Macroeconomics (4 journals in one).

Behavioral and Brain Sciences. A very “old” journal [50] that already existed before
the web (born in 1979). Very relevant articles, after peer review, are selected for open
commentary. The editor invites a number of reviewers to send their comments (at least
10). Comments are reviewed (sometimes edited). Sent to the author who can reply (but
not modify the article). All this material is published together in the journal (a unique pdf
ﬁle). It has a very high impact factor.

Psycoloquy [87] was similar. The always quoted [18] journal created by Stevan Har-
nad used to publish comments together with articles, but hasn’t published anything since
2002.

Living Reviews. As a diﬀerent journal concept we can consider Living Reviews [77],
three journals publishing only Review articles, solicited from experts in the ﬁeld by an
international Editorial Board, subject to peer-review, regularly being updated by their
authors to incorporate the latest developments in the ﬁeld. Nothing innovative in peer
review, however. A similar model could be used for a particular section of a journal,
devoted to reviews.

– 5 –

PLoS ONE. The new journal of the PLoS family [85]. The novelty is not only in
the access model, common to all PLoS journals, but in that it is a unique big journal, no
restricted to a subject, with open and closed peer review. It has just opened for submission
(august 2006).

Each submission will be assessed by a member of the editorial board before publica-
tion. This pre-publication peer review will concentrate on technical rather than subjective
concerns and may involve discussion with other members of the editorial board and/or
the solicitation of formal reports from independent referees. If published, papers will be
accompanied by comments from the handling editorial board member and will be made
available for community-based open peer review involving online annotation, discussion,
and rating. Reviewers may remain anonymous, but are strongly urged to sign their reports.

InterJournal. Another journal based on the idea that more interdisciplinary publishing
areas are needed [69]. Aims to cover various topics in science and engineering. Moreover
it does not directly host full text articles — that are left on the author choosen archive
or server, together with all accompanying material such as computer programs, raw data,
videos — but only metadata and comments.

Manuscripts are immediately accessible upon submission, and any qualiﬁed referee can
review the article. However, at the discretion of the authors, during an initial refereeing
period access may be limited to a few editor selected referees. The acceptance, category of
publication, and subject areas of publication are ultimately determined by the editors.

Also Advances in Theoretical and Mathematical Physics [45] used to be an
overlay of the archives and provided only certiﬁcation. After an interruption of the service
it is now a classic on-line journal.

[84] is an online academic journal accepting publications on any subject.

Philica.
It
provides a process of academic peer review, transparent (reviews can be seen publicly)
and dynamic (because opinions can change over time, and this is reﬂected in the review
process).

Only academics can register and hence publish papers and write reviews.

Philica is like eBay for academics. When somebody reviews your article, the impact
of that review depends on the reviewer’s own reviews. This means that the opinion of
somebody whose work is highly regarded carries more weight than the opinion of somebody
whose work is rated poorly. A person’s standing, and so their impact on other people’s
ratings, changes constantly. Reviews are anonymous.

Naboj. Also Naboj [80] is not a proper journal. It lets readers review online scientiﬁc
articles. At present it allows to review only articles from arXiv [47]. The review system is
modeled on Amazon and users have an opportunity to evaluate the reviews as well as the
articles. Alpha version. Not many posts so far.

4. Peer review

4.1 What’s wrong with peer review?

Many studies have made a thorough analysis of all the problems of peer review (see for
instance Rowland [34], McKiernan [26], Williamson [44], P¨oschl [30], Grivell [17]). In 2002
a general review of 19 diﬀerent studies [21] concluded that there is “little evidence for
eﬀectiveness of scientiﬁc peer review”.

A summary list of problems could be:

• Cost.

• Subjectivity.

• Bias. Discrimination, or situations where author and referee are competitors in some
sense, or belong to warring schools of thought. There is evidence3 of discrimination
by fame, institution, geography, gender. Some institutions, like COPE [58], try to
vigilate and assist complaining authors.

• Abuse. By authors

– Too many articles out of one piece of research (so called salami-publishing), or

duplicate publication.

– Aiming too high: authors aiming too high enter a downward spiral of peer-review
and rejection until the paper reaches its level. The same paper is reviewed many
times (multiplication of costs, loss of time). To address this concern see [51]

– Intellectual theft: omission or downgrading of junior staﬀ by senior authors.

and by reviewers

– Plagiarism (stealing others yet unpublished work that has been sent for review).

– Delaying publication of potentially competing research.

• Detecting defects. Godlee et al. [14] report an experiment in which they modiﬁed a
paper (already known and accepted for publication) introducing 8 areas of weakness
and sent it to 420 reviewers. In the 221 reports received an average of 2 defects was
detected. No one reported more than ﬁve defects, several zero.

• Fraud and Misconduct. Not generated by peer review but almost impossible to detect

for referees

– Fabrication of results

– Falsiﬁcation of data

– False claim of authorship for results

– 7 –

3Evidence means statistical studies that report a correlation between review outcomes and diﬀerent

categories.

• Delay. Peer review is too slow, even though several journals set targets and often

obtain they are respected.

Jennings in the Nature debate [81] defends peer-review as to ﬁnd something better
should meet several criteria. Something could help editors: manuscript tracking systems
can provide feedback on where delays arise; feedback on the quality of their decisions: look
retrospectively at the citations to accepted versus rejected papers,

In the end more than one author applied to peer review the famous Churchill’s sentence
on democracy: it is the worst form of government except all those other forms that have
been tried from time to time.

4.2 Alternative peer review models

Neo-classical. Classical peer review transplanted in the World Wide Web. This is what
the great majority of journals do, particularly those that existed also as paper journals, with
diﬀerent degrees of web integration. From almost email only, to all-in-one web applications.

No peer review. There is a lot of people suggesting that peer review is no longer
necessary, starting from the observation that all the articles on arXiv [47] are eventually
published on some journal and that citation ﬁgures of arXiv itself and refereed journals
are not diﬀerent [9].

S. Mizzaro [27] proposes a system where all articles in a given repository are voluntarily
and freely rated by readers. A very reﬁned algorithm takes into account each reader’s judg-
ment weighted on the basis of the reader’s skill as a reviewer, and readers are encouraged
to express correct judgments by a feedback mechanism that estimates their own quality.
This system was designed for the Tips project, see a simpler explanation in [39].

S. Harnad correctly points out that as long as peer review exists also the free material
is written with that in mind: the invisible hand of peer review [19]. Also R. Kling [23]
thoroughly analyzes the model of unrefereed scholarly publishing highlighting problems
and diﬃculties.

An example of journal without peer review could be the naive experiment of Electronic
Journal of Cognitive and Brain Sciences [64] proposed by Z. Nadasdy [28]: articles are freely
rated by readers.

Open peer review. The most concrete and experimented proposal, although not a
revolution.

The British Medical Journal

[54] is probably the most prestigious journal to make

reviewers’ names known to the authors [37].

In BioMed central

[53], Many journals operate traditional anonymous peer review.
Others, including the medical BMC-series titles, operate ‘open peer review’, in which re-
viewers are asked to sign their reviews. For these titles, the pre-publication history of each
paper (including submitted versions, reviewers’ reports and authors’ responses) is linked
to from the published article.

In Journal of Medical Internet Research [74] names of reviewers are published at the

bottom of the paper.

– 8 –

The most complete analysis of the advantages of open peer review was done by
F. Godlee [13]: ethical superiority, accoutability, credit for the reviewers and authors’
favour greatly outbalance the adverse eﬀects. As revealed by a thorough study published
on JAMA revealing the reviewers’ identity doesn’t seem to aﬀect signiﬁcantly reviewers’
recommendations or time taken to review [41] detection of errors [14] and quality of re-
views [22, 5].

Biology Direct [52] (see also Koonin et al. in the Nature debate [81]) not only makes
peer review open but removes the journal’s role in reviewer selection, making the author
responsible for obtaining three reviewers’ reports, via the journal’s Editorial Board.
In
essence, an article is rejected from the journal if no appropriate Board member agrees to
review it, because agreeing means associating one’s name to that article. Limitations are
imposed to avoid frequent author-referee couplings.

Linked to open peer review is the idea of authors suggesting one or more reviewers’
names (for instance in JMIR [74] and many other journals) Also in this case quality of
reviews is not signiﬁcantly aﬀected according to E. Wager et al. [42]. Another study points
out that suggesting or excluding reviewers raises the probability of publication [16].

Many journals who maintain referees’ names secret, at least acknowledge them pub-

lishing every year the full list of referees.

Double-blind peer review.
In order to reinstate equilibrium in the author-reviewer
dynamic some suggest to hide the author’s identity as well [25]. It is suggested that this
should address many concerns about peer review (subjectivity, bias . . . see above). But
this would work only with extremely honest reviewers, otherwise it is very easy to retrieve
author’s name (in physics it’s enough to search the arXives [47]).

This kind of peer review is used, for instance, by ASTRA — Astrophysics and Space

Sciences Transactions [48].

Commentary-based.

• Commentaries pre PR: this is the case already described in Atmospheric Chemistry
and Physics [49]. It was also adopted by Electronic Transactions on Artiﬁcial In-
telligence [66]: it provided a process for open discussion about articles and feedback
to authors before an article was accepted. This discussion was shown and preserved
on the ETAI website, and participants in the discussion were not anonymous. The
discussion about the article was combined with subsequent conﬁdential refereeing
where referees are only supposed to return a verdict of ‘pass’ or ‘fail’. The journal
hasn’t published since 2002

The noteworthiest experiment of this kind is the one by Nature [8] that in june 2006
launched a trial of open discussion parallel to traditional peer-review. A submitted
article, if the author so whishes, is posted in an open repository where it can be freely
discussed. Traditional peer review goes on in parallel, and the editor can make the
most of the discussion to achieve his decision. Very few comments posted so far.

• Commentaries post PR: Psycoloquy and Behavioural and Brain Sciences have already

been mentioned in the journal model section [50, 87].

– 9 –

The Medical Journal of Australia [78] in 1997 made a trial for post acceptance com-
mentary to be published along with articles
http://www.mja.com.au/public/information/project.html. No report on results and
no such issue in recent publications.

In Expert Reviews in Molecular Medicine [67], each article has an accompanying
discussion group. Anyone can post comments and questions and/or reply to previous
comments, with the possibility of being alerted for direct replies or new posts.

• Commentaries pre & post PR: the Journal of Interactive Media in Education [73]
has a very complicate and thorough review process divided into stages: submission,
editor chooses three experts, experts discuss with author, paper is made available
to public and discussed by readers, authors and experts, paper is revised, publised.
Discussion can continue. All the material is published alongside the paper.

Established in 1996, after a good initial success now publishes very few articles.

Institution-based. One example is the so called guild model [24] based on the assump-
tion that a given department (or research unit) has its own manuscript series. Access to
these series is reserved to faculty members, with no other ﬁlter. In some sense papers are
judged based on the careers of their authors.

Several softwares, like D-Space [63] and eprints [65], allow institutions to set up their

manuscript repositories.

A diﬀerent situation is the one of large HEP collaborations, studied by [7], where are
internal peer review is in place. When submitted to peer reviewed journals, 100% of papers
are eventually accepted,

Citation-based. Not really proposed or applied. Citation analysis could assist editors in
the choice of referees (see above the journal that scholars deserve [32]). A very interesting
tool that analyzes citations is CiteBase [55].

Of course also other services like Scopus [91], the (in)famous Science Citation Index [90]
or Scholar Google [89] cover citation counting with diﬀerent outcomes and diﬀerent useful-
ness [3].

Computer-assisted. The Journal of High Energy Physic JHEP [72] falls in this category
because of the automatic assignemt to editors (based on a keywords driven algorithm). Such
a system is not claimed by any other journal, it would probably deserve to be more widely
publicized.

This is probably a ﬁeld where many advances can be envisaged.
The automatized assignment to the editor could be improved using cognitive ﬁltering:
automatic analysis of a text (maybe the abstract or the full text) can create a proﬁle
to be compared with similar proﬁles created for each editor. This would give automatic
assignments without even havign to choose keywords (a potential source of mistakes).

Editors could be helped in the choice of referees by social-network based algorithm like

the one proposed by Rodriguez [32].

– 10 –

It would also be possible to provide editors and referees with “objective data” con-

cerning the paper like download and citation ﬁgures of the paper as a preprint.

Moderator-based. D. Stern [38] suggests a system where the moderator ﬁlters out only
inappropriate or oﬀending papers. All others are archived. Some (by the moderator, by
download ﬁgures, by readers’ suggestion) are pointed to the attention of the editorial board.
In some sense it is similar to the model proposed by Rodriguez (see above the “system

that scholars deserve”).

5. News from the outside world

W. Arms [2] (see also Arms in the Nature debate [81]) invites to consider what examples
the web oﬀers about quality assessing; even those coming from very diﬀerent contexts.
Along this path we can mention:

Wikipedia. On the footsteps of Wikipedia, an interactive encyclopaedia of the subject
covered by the journal(s) could be established. Maybe a ﬁrst version of some articles could
be written by invited scientists. There are many open source softwares to manage a system
like wikipedia (see for instance “wiki”on Wikipedia).

Also a list of keywords, or the taxonomy to categorize the materials could be managed

collaboratively. See Anderson in the Nature debate [81].

Del.icio.us.
It is a web site [60] for the public archiving of bookmarks. A collaborative
tagging systems (analyzed by A. Golder et al. [15]) entirely user driven allows classiﬁcation
of the material.

Many other sites use collaborative tagging: Flickr (images) Dailymotion (video),
. . . and also Connotea [57], the Nature Publishing Group free online reference manage-
ment system, similar to Del.icio.us, for all researchers, clinicians and scientists to publicly
archive and classify scholarly references and bookmarks.

Particularly devoted to articles is CiteULike [56]. Always with collaborative tagging.
When one sees an interesting paper on the web, he can click one button and have it added
to the personal library. CiteULike automatically extracts the citation details. The library
can be shared with others, and one can ﬁnd out who is reading the same papers. In turn,
this can help to discover relevant literature.

Blogs. Blogs are now quite frequent also in scientiﬁc communication. Nature has
recently added blogs to its news articles (see for instance the blog on peer review
http://blogs.nature.com/nature/peerreview/debate/comments/).

Concernig blogs see also [31]. As an example of blog for scientists see the Mass Spec-

trometry Blog [79].

The portal Postgenomic.com [86] collates posts from life science blogs and then does
useful and interesting things with those data. For example, you can see which papers
are currently being discussed by neurologists, or which web pages are being linked to by
bioinformaticians. It also uses a tagging system.

– 11 –

Internet drafts. As Arms [2] points out there are situations where the ﬁnal document
must be almost perfect, and hence, without worrying about time, very complicated review
processes are set up.

As described in at the The Internet Engineering Task Force [68] anybody can submit
an Internet Draft, which will be 1. published as an Internet Draft; 2. openly commented
on; 3. revised by its author(s); Steps 1 to 3 can be repeated a number of times. Then
an Area Director has to take the draft to the IESG (Internet Engineering Steering Group)
for wider discussion. Further changes can be required, or the draft can be rejected. The
document still has to go through the states of Proposed Standard and Draft Standard to
eventually become a Full Internet Standard. The whole procedure usually takes years.

A similar procedure is in place for the World Wide Web Consortium Process Document.
The interest of these processes is in the fact that very high quality is guaranteed
without peer review. It could be of inspiration for the production of particular documents,
like collaborative review articles.

6. Standards to be compliant with

These are the standards that nowadays all the most important journal respect.

• Open Archives Initiative [82]. Not only open access archives, but also big subscrip-
tion-based publishers make their metadata available in a OAI-PMH-compliant for-
mat.

• DOI [62] — Digital Object Identiﬁers are used to retrieve objects persistently. A
resolver is like CrossRef [59] is needed to transform DOIs into URLs: CrossRef par-
ticipating publishers deposit article metadata, and CrossRef provides the link from
the DOI to the original object.

A serious problem with DOI is explained in [20]: when a library has access to a
resouce through a consortium or another web site, this is ignored by DOI resolvers
and the reader ends up in a page where cannot read the full text.

All major publishers take part in DOI, including IOPP.

• Unlike DOI, OpenURL [83] enables context-sensitive linking from a reference in a
scholarly information system to resources relevant to the referenced item. Clicking
on a link will pass the request to a linking server enabling the provision of a list of
relevant services appropriate for the user.

See also A. Apps [1]: why OpenURL?

• Feed RSS. A system to keep users updated on what’s going on on a site.
already uses it http://www.iop.org/EJ/help/-topic=rss/journal/1126-6708.

IOPP

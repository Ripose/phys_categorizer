On Value at Risk for foreign exchange rates - the copula
approach

∗

The aim of this paper is to determine the Value at Risk (V aR) of the
portfolio consisting of long positions in foreign currencies on an emerging
market. Basing on empirical data we restrict ourselves to the case when
the tail parts of distributions of logarithmic returns of these assets follow
the power laws and the lower tail of associated copula C follows the power
law of degree 1.

We will illustrate the practical usefulness of this approach by the anal-

ysis of the exchange rates of EUR and CHF at the Polish forex market.

1. Introduction

The present paper is a continuation of [1].

In the previous paper we
dealt with the purely asymptotic estimations, whereas now our goal is to
provide some estimates valid for quite a substantial part of the tail.

We shall deal with the following simple case. An investor operating on
an emerging market, has in his portfolio two currencies which are highly
dependent, for example euros (EUR) and Swiss franks (CHF). Let R1 and
R2 be their rates of returns at the end of the investment. Let wi be the part
of the capital invested in the i-th currency, w1 + w2 = 1, w1, w2 > 0. So the
ﬁnal value of the investment equals

W1 = W0 · (1 + R), R = w1R1 + w2R2.

Our aim is to estimate the risk of keeping the portfolio. As a measure of
risk we shall consider ”Value at Risk” (V aR), which last years became one

of the most popular measures of risk in the ”practical” quantitative ﬁnance
(see for example [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] ). Roughly speaking the idea is to
determine the biggest amount one can lose on certain conﬁdence level α.

If the distribution functions of R1 and R2 are continuous then, for the

conﬁdence level 1 − α, V aR is determined by the condition

P (W0 − W1 ≤ V aR1−α) = 1 − α.

Note that if Qα denotes the α quantile of the rate of return R, then we can
denote V aR in the following way

V aR1−α = −W0Qα.

We shall based on the Sklar theorem, which elucidates the role that cop-
ulas play in the relationship between multivariate distribution functions and
their univariate margins (see [10, 11, 12]). We describe the joint distribution
of rates of return R1 and R2 with the help of a copula C

P (R1 ≤ x1, R2 ≤ x2) = C(F1(x1), F2(x2)),

where Fi is a distribution function of Ri. Note, that C is the joint distribu-
tion function of the random variables F1(R1) i F2(R2).

We recall that a function

C : [0, 1]2 −→ [0, 1],

is called a copula if

C(0, y) = C(x, 0) = 0, C(1, y) = y, C(x, 1) = x,

x1 < x2, y1 < y2 ⇒ C(x1, y1) + C(x2, y2) − C(x1, y2) − C(x2, y1) ≥ 0.

2. Basic empirical observations

2.1. Copulas

The copulas of ﬁnancial returns have a speciﬁc property, namely they

We recall that a copula C has a uniform lower tail if for suﬃciently small

have uniform tails.

qi

C(q1, q2) ≈ L(q1, q2),

where L is a nonzero function, which is positive homogeneous of degree 1
(compare [13, 14, 15, 1, 16])

∀t ≥ 0 L(tq1, tq2) = tL(q1, q2).

3

For the daily exchange rates EUR and CHF in polish z loty (PLN) we
can observe this phenomenon even for 10% part of the tails. On the scatter
diagram below (Fig.1) we plot the ranks of daily returns of EUR and CHF
(from January 1995 to April 2006, 2858 returns). One can observe that
there is more points at the lower and upper corners than average. At the
second ﬁgure we enlarge the lower corner.

4

To check the homogeneity of the lower tail of the copula we count the

number of pairs of ranks in squares having the origin as a lower vertex

W (n) = ♯{(xi, yi) : xi ≤ n, yi ≤ n}

and number of pairs in these squares under and over the diagonal

W+(n) = ♯{(xi, yi) : xi < yi ≤ n}

W−(n) = ♯{(xi, yi) : yi < xi ≤ n}.

On ﬁgure 3 we show the graphs of these functions. They are close to linear.

2.2. Univariate tails

The daily log-returns of exchange rates (ln(1 + Ri)) have the power-like

tails (compare [17] §9.3, [18] §2.3.1 or [19, 20, 21, 22]).

For suﬃciently small r (−1 < r ≪ 0)

Fi(r) ≈ ai · (bi − ln(1 + r))

−γi,

i = 1, 2.

For the daily exchange rates EUR and CHF in polish z loty (PLN) such
approximation are valid even for 10% part of the lower tails. On ﬁgure
4 we plot the logarithms of minus log-returns against the logarithms of
probability.

5

3. Main results

Our aim is to show how to estimate Value at Risk of the portfolio
(V aR(W )) in terms of Values at Risk of portfolios of the same initial value
W0 but consisting only of one currency (V aR(S1) and V aR(S2)). The ﬁrst
estimate requires only that the tail part of the copula is homogeneous of
degree 1.

Theorem 3.1. If for q1, q2 < α∗ C(q) = L(q), where L is homogeneous of
degree 1, then for α < α∗

V aR1−L(1,1)α(W ) ≥ w1V aR1−α(S1) + w2V aR1−α(S2).

The second estimate requires also some properties of lower tails of the

marginal distribution.

Theorem 3.2. If for q1, q2 < α∗ C(q) = L(q), where L is homogeneous of
−1
degree 1, and for −1 < t ≤ F

(α∗)

Fi(t) = ai · (bi − ln(1 + t))

−γi, ai > 0, γi > 1,

i = 1, 2,

then for α < α∗

V aR1−α(W ) ≤ w1V aR1−α(S1) + w2V aR1−α(S2).

6

On ﬁgures 5 and 6 we show the plot of the empirical V aR of the portfolio
(w1 = 0, 4 EUR, w2 = 0, 6 CHF) and the estimates based on the theoretical
V aR’s for both currencies. We put W0 = 1.

4. Proofs

P (R ≤ r) = P (w1R1 + w2R2 ≤ r) = µC(Vr) ≈ µL(Vr),

where

−1
Vr = {q : w1F

(q1) + w2F

(q2) ≤ r}.

Note that the domain Vr is a generalized trapezoid.

Vr = {q : 0 ≤ q1 ≤ q∗, 0 ≤ q2 ≤ ϕr(q1)},

where q∗ = F1( r+w2

w1 ) and ϕr(q1) = F2( r−w1F

Lemma 4.1. If rW0 = −w1V aR1−α(S1) − w2V aR1−α(S2) then the square
[0, α] × [0, α] is contained in Vr.

Proof. If qi ≤ α then

Now we are able to ﬁnish the proof of theorem 3.1.

Proof of theorem 3.1. (compare [23])
Due to the homogeneity we get

µC([0, α] × [0, α]) = C(α, α) = L(1, 1)α.

Let rW0 = −w1V aR1−α(S1)−w2V aR1−α(S2). Since the square [0, α]×[0, α]
is contained in Vr, we have

µC(Vr) ≥ L(1, 1)α.

Therefore the L(1, 1)α quantile of R is smaller than r. Thus

V aR1−L(1,1)α(W ) ≥ −rW0 = w1V aR1−α(S1) + w2V aR1−α(S2).

This ﬁnishes the proof of theorem 3.1.

Lemma 4.2. Let rW0 = −w1V aR1−α(S1) − w2V aR1−α(S2). If

Fi(t) = ai · (bi − ln(1 + t))

−γi, ai > 0, γi > 1,

i = 1, 2,

then the function

Moreover the ﬁrst derivative is always positive, hence ψ is strictly increasing.
Also the second derivative is always positive (hence ψ is strictly convex).
Indeed: the second component of the ﬁrst derivative is a product of four
positive factors, from which only the last one (q
) has negative derivative
but it is reduced by positive derivative of the ﬁrst component.

Since γ1 is greater then 1 the ﬁnal result is positive.

Lemma 4.3. Let rW0 = −w1V aR1−α(S1)−w2V aR1−α(S2). If the function
ψ(q1) = q1
ϕr(q1) has properties listed in lemma 4.2 then µL(Vr) ≤ α.

Proof.

For every copula there is an upper bound C(q1, q2) ≤ min(q1, q2) ([10]).

Abstract

We analyse the structure of the distribution of eigenvalues of the stock market
correlation matrix with increasing length of the time series representing the price
changes. We use 100 highly-capitalized stocks from the American market and relate
result to the corresponding ensemble of Wishart random matrices. It turns out
that systematically more eigenvalues stay beyond the borders prescribed by this
variant of the Random Matrix Theory (RMT). This may indicate that even the
bulk of the spectrum of the stock market correlation matrix carries some sort of
correlations that are masked by a measurement noise when the time series used
to construct the matrix are short. We also study some other characteristics of the
”noisy” eigensignals, like their return distributions, temporal correlations or their
multifractal spectra and the results support the above conclusions.

1 Introduction

The formalism of correlation matrix is widely used in contemporary ﬁnance
both on theoretical and on practical level in order to estimate correlation
structure of a ﬁnancial market or in order to create portfolios characterized
by given properties. This formalism is especially important for various risk
management techniques like e.g. the Markowitz optimal portfolio theory [1]
which helps one constructing portfolios oﬀering minimal risk at a given re-
turn or maximal return at a given risk. This theory uses eigenvalues of the
correlation matrix as a measure of the portfolio’s risk: no matter which eigen-
value one uses, it is fully informative and a corresponding portfolio is therefore

valid. However, recently such understanding of the portfolio selection has been
strongly challenged in a series of papers linking the correlation matrix formal-
ism and the portfolio theories with Random Matrix Theory (RMT) and the
ensemble of Wishart matrices (sample random correlation matrices) in par-
ticular [2,3]. Accordingly, the current view is that only a few eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of the correlation matrix are important in practice and carry any
signiﬁcant information about the market, while all others describe nothing
more than pure noise. Thus, only those few portfolios which correspond to
the non-random eigenstates of the correlation matrix can be in fact regarded
as a potential investment target. This observation profoundly restricting the
applicability of classical portfolio theories rises a question of how to recon-
cile the two contradicting views on the RMT-like portfolios. This problem is
at present one of central issues of econophysics and is intensively studied by
many diﬀerent groups. One of directions in which current analyses go is the
so-called denoising of the correlation matrices which aims at removing the es-
timation errors of the correlations due to ﬁnite size of empirical data [4,5,6,7].
Another possible approach is to look into the empirical data and to answer the
question what is there really random and what is not. In order to do this, one
can ﬁrstly investigate the properties of dynamics of diﬀerent portfolios calcu-
lated by using the correlation matrix framework, to compare characteristics
of random and non-random ones, and, possibly, to identify those signatures
of the dynamics which represent some non-random phenomena even in the
case of the RMT-like eigenstates. In the present paper we would like to follow
this idea and draw some conclusions based on data from the American stock
market.

2 Formalism

In general, a portfolio P consists of a number of securities Xs, s = 1, ..., N as-
sociated with weights ws characterizing the fraction of total amount of capital
invested in a particular security. Return of such a portfolio after time ∆t is the
weighted sum of logarithmic price increments gs(∆t) = ln ps(t + ∆t)
ln ps(t)
of individual securities Xs:

wsgs(∆t).

By ﬁxing the time scale ∆t and creating a time series of length T from consec-

utive discrete-time portfolio’s returns

deﬁne certain portfolio, from an investor’s perspective only those portfolios
which are characterized by speciﬁc predeﬁned properties can be of practical

According to the classical Markowitz theory, this risk can be related to corre-

More speciﬁcally, let one consider a set of N securities (e.g. stocks) each rep-

tracting the contribution of the two most collective components associated with λ1
and λ2 for four diﬀerent values of Q; (a) is the same as Fig. 1(c). Shaded regions
correspond to RMT predictions for given Q.

Each element of C is obviously the Pearson correlation coeﬃcient Cm,n be-
tween a pair of signals m and n. The correlation matrix can be diagonalized
by solving the eigenvalue problem

Cxi = λixi,

i = 1, ..., N.

(4)

From the point of view of investment theories, each eigenvector xi can be
considered as a realization of an N-security portfolio Pi with the weights equal
to the eigenvector components x(k)
, k = 1, ..., N. For a non-degenerate matrix
C, Pi and Pj are independent for each pair of their indices, which allows one
to choose such a portfolio, whose risk is independent of others.

From a dynamical perspective, each eigenvector (and thus portfolio) can be
associated with the corresponding time series of the portfolio’s returns by the
expression analogous to Eq.(1)

Fig. 3. Standard deviation σ(Zi) for all eigensignals Zi (top panel) together with
the corresponding eigenvalues λi (bottom panel). Almost perfect correspondence
between both panels is visible; the diﬀerence in units in the vertical axes is due to
eigenvector normalization performed by diagonalization procedure.

These time series we shall call the eigensignals Zi (see also [8,9] for an alter-
native realization). One of the most important properties of such eigensignals
is that their risk can be easily related with the corresponding eigenvalues:

R(Pi) = σ2(Zi) = xT

i Cxi = λi,

(6)

Thus, the eigenvalue size is a risk measure and, in consequence, the larger λi,
the larger variance of Zi and also the larger risk of the corresponding portfolio
Pi.

3 Results

−

We analyzed high-frequency data from the American stock market [10] in the
period 1 Dec 1997
31 Dec 1999. In order to calculate inter-stock correlations
we chose a set of stocks of N = 100 highly capitalized companies listed in
NYSE or NASDAQ (capitalization > $1010 in each case). These stocks are
frequently traded (0.01-1 transactions/s) and hence the time scale of ∆t = 5
min allowed us to perform a statistically signiﬁcant analysis; such a short time
scale was also desired because of length of time series (approx. 40,000 data
points). Typically, the portfolio analysis is performed on daily data; usually
this time scale is recommended because of the fact that at this scale the

correlations present at the market are well-developed. However, restricting the
analysis to such long ∆t seems not to be necessary in contemporary markets,
in which both pieces of information arrive more frequently and the investors
react to them quicker than in the past. This obviously leads to acceleration
of the market time paced by consecutive transactions. Thus, as recent papers
document [13,14], for highly capitalized stocks which are also among the most
frequently traded ones, the correlations reach their saturation level at the
time horizons much shorter than a day. In case of our data this time horizon
corresponds to about 30 min, while for ∆t = 5 min the correlations associated
with λ1 are clearly very pronounced and informative and λ1 assumes approx.
2/3 of its saturation level [14].

3.1 Eigenvalue distribution

The eigenvalue distribution oﬀers a representative and the most frequently
used measure to quantify the characteristics of matrices, especially in the
context of relating them to RMT. Let us therefore start presentation of the
results with the eigenvalue spectrum of the correlation matrix. Figure 1(a)
shows all 100 eigenvalues distributed along the horizontal axis, denoted by
vertical lines. The largest eigenvalue λ1 ≃
18, repelled from the rest of the

6

spectrum, describes the collective eigenstate which can be identiﬁed with the
2.4 absorbs some collectivity either, but its magnitude is by
market. λ2 ≃
an order of magnitude smaller than λ1 and can be related with some branch-
speciﬁc factor (the same applies to a few next eigenvalues). Figure 1(a) displays
that only a small fraction of λi’s falls within the RMT region deﬁned by its
bounds: λmax
2/√Q (shaded vertical region in Figure), where
406 [15]. However, due to the fact that TrC = 100, the existence
Q = T /N
of strong collective components can eﬀectively supress the noisy part of the C
eigenspectrum, shifting smaller eigenvalues towards zero. Therefore, in order
to correct for this eﬀects it is recommended to remove the market factor Z1
from the data [11]. This can be done by means of the least square ﬁtting of
this factor represented by z1(j) to each of the original stock signals gk(j):

min = 1 + 1/Q

≃

±

gk(j) = αk + βkz1(j) + ǫ(1)

k (j),

(7)

where αi, βi are parameters, and then we can construct a new correlation
matrix C(1) from the residuals ǫ(1)
k (j) (e.g. ref. [2,11]). Now signiﬁcantly more
eigenvalues fall within the shaded RMT region as Figure 1(b) documents.
This can be done once again and the λ2 component can also be removed
leading to the eigenspectrum presented in Figure 1(c). In fact, now many
more eigenvalues (γ = 49%) overlap with the RMT interval < λmin, λmax >,
though, interestingly, this value is qualitatively diﬀerent from results presented
earlier in [2,11,8] where vast majority of the eigenvalues was inside the RMT
bounds.

In order to shed some light on this problem we note that in both cited works
the parameter Q was much smaller than in our case: Q = 4.1 and 6.4 in
ref. [11] and Q = 3.2 in [2] and therefore the RMT spectrum was respectively
wider. By manipulating the Q value for our data (we divide the time series
into windows of length T ′ with predeﬁned Q′ = T ′/N, then we calculate C′ for
each window and average its eigenspectrum over all the windows) we obtain
the correlation matrix eigenspectrum which can be compared with the original
one for the undivided time series (Q = 406). Since in each case the average λ1
is strongly repelled (and its value is approximately the same as in Fig. 1(a)),
we follow the earlier procedure and remove the collective components related
to both λ1 and λ2 for each window before averaging the resulting eigenspectra.
Figure 2 shows such decollectiﬁed average eigenspectra for four diﬀerent values
of Q. What is immediately evident, the wider the shaded RMT region, the
more eigenvalues it overlaps with. For the smallest presented Q = 3 as much
as γ = 89% eigenvalues fall within the RMT realm which is compatible with
γ = 94% from ref. [2]. We conclude that for a typical realization of Q < 10 in
practical applications (usually large N and relatively small T as it happens
for daily data), only the largest eigenvalues are able to deviate from the RMT
predictions, while the other eigenvalues possibly carrying some more subtle

correlations may be forced to spuriously merge with the random bulk. This
purely statistical eﬀect suggests that the random part of the C eigenspectrum
can in fact comprise non-random components which can be discerned from
noise only if one uses data with larger Q. This is in favour of using data
also with frequencies higher than the daily one as a tool for denoising C. (It is
noteworthy that a parrallel eﬀect of shifting the small non-random eigenvalues
(λi ≈

λmin) into the RMT interval has been presented recently in ref. [12].)

3.2 Eigenvector properties

Figure 3 illustrating the strong relation between the risk and the eigenvalues
(Eq.(6)), displays the eigensignal variance calculated for each Zi (upper panel)
and all the eigenvalues of C (lower panel). Essentially no signiﬁcant qualitative
diﬀerence between these two quantities can be found, exactly as expected.
Apart from the eigenvalue spectrum, RMT oﬀers useful predictions regarding
distribution of the eigenvector components for a completely random matrix,
which assumes the form of the Porter-Thomas (Gaussian) distribution. In
contrast, in the case of a collective non-random eigenvector, there exists some
kind of vector localization or delocalization. Figure 4 presents distributions of
the components for typical eigenvectors of our matrix and for a few speciﬁc
cases. The eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue λ1 is completely

delocalized because all its components are roughly the same and the associated
distribution is centered at 0.1. This is standard situation and in evolution
of the stock prices this eigenvector represents the market factor. Also non-
random is the eigenvector for λ2 with the components distribution still far
from Gaussian. A trace of randomness however occurs already for λ3 and is
clear for a bulk of eigenvectors in the next panel of Figure 4. On the other
hand, for the extremely small eigenvalues, localization can be perfectly seen.

One of the key properties of the eigenvector (and thus also the eigenstate Zi)
is the eﬀective number of its large components. A related measure is inverse
participation ratio

Ii =

(x(k)

i )4,

k = 1, ..., N

(8)

and its reciprocal 1/Ii (“participation ratio”). Figure 5 presents this latter
quantity calculated for all the eigenvectors together with its value N/3 for ran-
dom case in which x(k)
are taken independently from normal distribution. For
i = 1 almost all the companies contribute to the corresponding eigenvector Z1,
which justiﬁes treating this eigenvector as the market factor. The eigenvectors
for a few smaller eigenvalues show also slightly higher number of participating
companies than for the random case but, in contrast, the eigensignals associ-
ated with the smallest 20 eigenvalues allow one to characterize them as the

i

components related to only few stocks. The rest of the eigenvectors seem to
be random, with small deviation from the predicted value of N/3 probably
due to the existence of fat tails of the returns distributions.

Figure 6 presents the time series of the eigensignal returns z1(j) calculated
according to Eq.(5) for λ1 and λ25. Curiously, if one compares both series
visually, forgetting the diﬀerence in vertical axis, it could be quite diﬃcult
to point out which of the two corresponds to the most collective eigenstate.
Both eigensignals are nonstationary with likely extreme ﬂuctuations and both
of them reveal also volatility clustering. Thus, one can infer that there are
statistical properties which are invariant under change of the eigenstates with
only minor diﬀerences between collective and noisy eigenstates.

In agreement with Figure 3, c.d.f. of the eigensignal returns (Figure 7(a)) show
that Z1 is characterized by much broader distribution than other eigensignals,
and that the same, but to a lesser extent, is true also for Z2. It is interesting
that, except for Z1, all the eigensignals are associated with the distributions
with the power law scaling in tails, almost exactly like for the original stock
returns (see e.g. [13,16,17,18]). Only Z1 presents diﬀerent behaviour: a short
range of power law scaling and signiﬁcant deviation from this behaviour for
> 5σ. This can be even more convincing if all the signals are normalized
z1|
|
to unit variance (Figure 7(b)); the power law slope with α
3 is typical for all
the eigensignals. Such shape of c.d.f. for Z1 can originate from the fact that
this eigensignal is composed as an average of almost 100 individual stocks,
while on average 1/3 of this number of stocks contribute to other eigensignals;
this is why Central Limit Theorem leaves its ﬁngerprints presumably on Z1.
However, this cannot be considered as a rule, because for other groups of stocks
being more intensively correlated, such peculiarity of the Z1’s c.d.f. might not
be observed.

Now let us look at temporal correlation properties of the eigensignals. Figure

for all the eigensignals Zi. The diﬀerence between Z1 and the rest of signals
is pronounced and resembles the corresponding diﬀerence in the case of the
eigensignals variance (Figure 3). In fact, memory in Z1 is about two orders
of magnitude longer than for the other eigensignals (for m > 1: c(
≃
c(
τ )). However, it cannot be said that Z1 (the market component)
absorbs all the memory of the evolution of stock prices. The volatility auto-
correlation function for the other eigensignals decay very slowly in time as
well.

Another interesting sort of nonlinear correlations are cross-correlations be-
; τ ). It has been observed that past re-
tween returns and volatility c(Zi,
Zi|
turns imply negatively correlated future moves in volatility, the so-called lever-
age eﬀect [19,20,21]. Figure 9 shows the cross-correlation function c(Zi,
; τ )
for the returns and the volatility for all the eigensignals. The leverage eﬀect
can be detected easily only for i = 1, 2, 3; all other eigensignals do not reveal
it. For i = 1 and i = 2 the correlations are qualitatively the same despite the
earlier-presented diﬀerences between the eigensignals. For i = 3 negative cor-
relations do not exist for the smallest values of τ , while they are the strongest
for τ > 100. In order to carry out this calculation we took signals for ∆t = 20
min, because analogous signals at smaller time scales are too noisy to show the
strong leverage eﬀect. Interestingly, for the original signals gs corresponding
to individual stocks s, the leverage eﬀect is much weaker and even diﬃcult to
observe at all.

3.4 Multifractal characteristics

One of the consequences of the broad probability distributions (Figure 7) and
of the nonlinear correlations (Figure 8 and 9) is multifractal character of sig-
nals, i.e. the existence of a continuous spectrum of scaling indices f (α). It has

already been shown in numerous works that stock returns form signals which
are multifractal both on daily and on high-frequency time scales [22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,32].
This behaviour can be even modeled with a good agreement if one introduces
statistical processes based on multiplicative cascades [21,33,34,35,36]. Due to
the fact that, by deﬁnition, the eigensignals are calculated as a sum of stock
returns, the multifractality of their components can be transferred to the re-
sulting eigensignal. Therefore one can expect that at least some of Zi’s are also
multifractal; there can exist diﬀerences in their singularity spectra because of
diﬀerent stock compositions for diﬀerent i’s, though. Owing to superiority
of Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MFDFA) [37] over Wavelet
Transform Modulus Maxima (WTMM) method [38] in the case of ﬁnancial
data [39], we applied former one to our time series in order to calculate the
singularity spectra f (α).

the end of the time series so that eventually there are 2Mes segments. In each
segment ν we ﬁt a l-th order polynomial P (l)

at least for some range of n. As a result of complete MF-DFA procedure we
obtain a family of generalized Hurst exponents h(q), which form a decreasing
function of q for a multifractal signal or are independent of q for a monofractal
one. A more convenient way to present the fractal character of data graphically
is to calculate the singularity spectrum f (α) by using the following relations:

α = h(q) + qh′(q)

f (α) = q[α

h(q)] + 1.

We computed the f (α) spectra with MF-DFA for all time series Zi and for
∆t = 5 min (shorter time scales are too noisy, while longer ones are repre-
sented by too short series for a reliable estimation of f (α)) and the corre-
sponding results are shown in Figure 10(a). Wide spectra prove that all Zi’s
are multifractal with only minor diﬀerences in widths of the spectra for dif-
ferent eigensignals. Although positions of maxima of the spectra vary, there is
no signiﬁcant i-dependence both in the positions and in shape of the spectra.
It is interesting that even the most collective and correlated eigensignal for
λ1 (the solid, distinguished line in Figure 10(a)) does not develop spectrum
which could deviate from the typical one. This is even more evident if we
compare the spectrum for Z1 with the average spectrum calculated from all
other Zi’s in Figure 10(b). Such similarity of multifractal properties of the
eigensignals representing completely diﬀerent correlation structure and diﬀer-
ent p.d.f.’s can suggest that the eigensignals corresponding to a few largest
λi’s and the ones corresponding to the bulk of the eigenspectrum are in fact
much more similar to each other than it is usually assumed. This also bears a

As we already know the autocorrelations of volatility
ferent from those for i > 1 (Figure 8), while the normalized returns have
similar c.d.f.’s for all i. Now we would like to compare the fractal properties
of diﬀerent eigensignals in order to separate the two sources of multifractality:
the broad distributions of returns and the correlations, and to compare the
singularity spectra f (α) for these sources. We follow the idea of [40] and we
study variability of generalized Hurst exponents h(q) for the actual and the
reshuﬄed eigensignals. If we denote the generalized Hurst exponent for the
randomized signal by hrand(q), its correlation counterpart reads

Variability of h(q) can be expressed by the diﬀerence

and, analogously, the variability of hrand(q) and hcorr(q). Each symbol in Fig-
ure 11 presents positions of the eigensignals Zi in (∆hcorr, ∆hrand) coordinates.
Eigensignals corresponding to the four largest eigenvalues are labelled. The

higher value of ∆hrand, the richer the multifractal behaviour due to the fat-
tailed probability distributions of returns. Analogously, high values of ∆hcorr
indicate strong contribution of the temporal correlations. It can be easily in-
ferred from this Figure that there is nothing characteristic in the positions
of the symbols related to Z1,...,4. Results collected in Figure 10(b) and Fig-
ure 11 indicate that the multifractal analysis cannot point out any essential
diﬀerences between the collective eigenstates and the noisy ones.

4 Conclusions

We analysed the eigensignals corresponding to diﬀerent eigenvalues of the em-
pirical correlation matrix calculated for the 100 highly-capitalized American
companies. From a practical point of view, these eigensignals represent tempo-
ral evolution of speciﬁc portfolios deﬁned by the corresponding eigenvectors of
C. We showed that despite the important diﬀerences in interpretation of dif-
ferent eigensignals, Zi’s for the collective and the noisy eigenvalues can reveal
diﬀerent or similar statistical properties depending on a particular quantity.
What diﬀers most is risk expressed by variance of an eigensignal, which is
very high for the most collective Z1, is also signiﬁcant for Z2, and is much
smaller for the rest of the Zi’s. This is closely related to the eigenvector prop-
erties, which are diﬀerent for highest and other λi’s. The risk is also related
to the width of the returns distributions, preventing the eigensignals for small
eigenvalues from high ﬂuctuations and the associated portfolios from large
losses. The second group of quantities which reveal diﬀerent values for diﬀer-
ent Zi’s are correlations, both those in volatility and those between returns
and volatility. On the other hand, there are properties that remain unaltered
when going from small to large values of i. The most interesting of them is
the multifractality of all eigensignals which is surprisingly roughly the same
for diﬀerent Zi’s. Curiously, this happens even if the above-mentioned corre-
lations vary among the eigensignals. One of possible sources of this can be
similar shape of tails of the probability distributions, which after normalizing
the eigensignal returns show the inverse cubic scaling for all i. Both the fat-
tailed distributions of returns and the multifractal character of eigensignals
for each eigenvalue lead to a conclusion that the noisy eigenstates might not
be so random as they are usually regarded by their relation to RMT. Rich
multifractal dynamics of the eigensignals corresponding to even the random
part of the eigenvalue spectrum suggests that strong nonlinear correlations are
present in the temporal evolution of each portfolio giving it signiﬁcance which
exceeds pure noise. This conclusion is strongly supported by the observation
(Section 3.1) that many real correlations may be masked by noise due to too
short signals considered in practical applications.

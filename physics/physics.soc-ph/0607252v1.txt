For some models of relevance in the social sciences we review some examples in which system
size plays an important role in the ﬁnal outcome of the dynamics. We discuss the conditions under
which changes of behavior can appear only when the number of agents in the model takes a ﬁnite
value. Those changes of behavior can be related to the apparent phase transitions that appear in
some physical models. We show examples in the Galam’s model of opinion transmission and the
Axelrod’s model of culture formation stressing the role that the network of interactions has on the
main results of both models. Finally, we present the phenomenon of system-size stochastic resonance
by which a forcing signal (identiﬁed as an advertising agent) is optimally ampliﬁed by a population
of the right (intermediate) size. Our work stresses the role that the system size has in the dynamics
of social systems and the inappropriateness of taking the thermodynamic limit for these systems.

I.

INTRODUCTION

In statistical physics we are used to taking routinely
the thermodynamic limit in which the number of con-
stituents (or, more precisely, the number of degrees of
freedom) N tends to inﬁnity[1]. This is necessary in
many aspects, such as determining the validity of the
statistical approach, the equivalence between ensembles,
the existence of phase transitions with symmetry break-
ing and discontinuities in the order parameters or their
derivatives, etc. When we apply the methods of sta-
tistical physics to explain the properties of macroscopic
matter, it is clear that the number N is always ﬁnite, but
very large. A good estimative of its order of magnitude is
the Avogadro number N0 = 6.023 × 1023. Consequently,
the nowadays widely used computer simulations of phys-
ical systems always struggle to get to larger and larger
systems with the continuous increasing demand in com-
puter resources.
In many cases as, for instance, when
trying to predict the thermodynamical properties near
a critical point, it is essential to use the well developed
techniques of ﬁnite size scaling[2] in order to extrapolate
the results to N → ∞.

When applying the same tools of statistical physics to
problems of interest in social sciences [3, 4, 5], we have
to take into account that the number of individuals or
agents considered can never be that large. In most cases,
realistic values of N range in the hundreds or thousands,
reaching at most a few million. The thermodynamic limit
might no be justiﬁed in this case, as the results in that
limit can vary with respect to those of ﬁnite-size systems.
Furthermore, new and interesting phenomena can appear
depending on the number of individuals or agents con-
sidered. In this paper we will review some ﬁnite-size re-
lated eﬀects that have been recently found in some mod-
els of interest in social systems and that exemplify cases
in which the thermodynamic limit does not capture the
essentials of the system’s behavior.

The outline of the paper is as follows:

in the follow-
ing section II A, we will explain the concept of apparent
phase transitions and pseudo-critical points by reviewing

a physical example in which a clearly observable change
of behavior disappears in the thermodynamic limit. We
will then show in the following sections that apparent
phase transitions also appear in two widely used models:
the Galam model for opinion spreading (in section II B)
and the Axelrod model of culture formation (in section
II C); ﬁnally, section III is devoted to the phenomenon of
system-size stochastic resonance in a model for opinion
formation that takes into account external inﬂuences. A
brief summary and concluding remarks are presented in
the ﬁnal section IV.

II. APPARENT PHASE TRANSITIONS

A. Pseudo-critical temperatures

A true phase transition can only appear in the ther-
modynamic limit [1]. This limit is needed for the singu-
larities inherent to the transition (for instance, the di-
vergences in the critical point of a continuous, second
order, phase transition or the discontinuities in a ﬁrst or-
der phase transition) to develop from the sum of analytic
functions. However, in some cases, ﬁnite systems show
a behavior that reminds us of a phase transition. An
example which has been extensively studied is the sine–
Gordon model for the growth of surfaces [6, 7]. Nowa-
days, it is well established that in two or more spatial di-
mensions the model displays a Kosterlitz–Thouless-type
phase transition from a (low temperature) smooth phase
to a (high temperature) rough phase at a given critical
value Tc of the temperature [8, 9, 10, 11, 12].

However, numerical simulations of this model seemed
to imply that the same transition was also present in
the one-dimensional case [13]. See the evidence in ﬁgure
1 where it can be observed that the roughness of the
one-dimensional surface is zero until a temperature Tc ≈
1 and then increases suddenly. Despite this numerical
evidence, the result was doubtful, since the theory clearly
indicated that such a phase transition was not possible
for a one-dimensional system [14, 15, 16]. In the view of

model as a function of the temperature [13]. Observe the ap-
parent transition between a smooth phase (roughness equal
to zero) to a rough phase at a pseudo-critical temperature
Tc ≈ 1. Diﬀerent symbols correspond to diﬀerent system
sizes, as indicated in the ﬁgure and the line is the result
ω2/N = T /12 of the Edwards-Wilkinson model valid at high
temperatures [17].

this negative prediction, one can revisit the simulation
data and conclude [13] that the deviation from smooth
to rough surfaces occurs at a pseudo-critical temperature
that depends on the system size as Tc(N ) ∼ 1/ ln(N ).
It is certainly true that in the thermodynamic limit the
transition point switches to Tc = 0. In other words, the
system does not display a phase transition, as demanded
by the rigourous theorems. However, it is also true that
for every ﬁnite system, a well deﬁned transition point
(which is not a true critical one) can be identiﬁed as
separating the smooth from the rough behavior. Since
the dynamics at low temperature is dominated by the
existence of many metastable states with large energy
barriers [6], a lot of numerical eﬀort is needed in order to
proof beyond any doubts that the transition point tends
to zero for increasing system size[13].

B. Galam’s model

There are several models that analyze the dynamics of
opinion formation in a society [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24,
25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40,
41]. The model introduced by S. Galam [20, 21] aims to
identify mechanisms by which an opinion, being initially
minority, can become majority in the long run. There
have been many recent examples of such change of opin-
ion: the rejection to the Maastricht treaty in Ireland, the
negative vote in France for the European constitution,
the switch in the belief of the authorship of the March
11th 2004 terrorists attacks in Madrid, the rumors con-
cerning some September 11th opinions in France [21], etc.

FIG. 2: The inset shows ρ as a function of p and N for
Galam’s model in which groups form independently of any
newtork structure. The size distribution of discussion groups
is uniformly distributed in [1, M ]. Open symbols correspond
to M = 4 (pc = 0.2133), while ﬁlled ones to M = 5
(pc = 0.3468). Diﬀerent symbols correspond to diﬀerent
system sizes between N = 103 and N = 106 (the tran-
sition sharpens with increasing system size). The main
plot shows the collapse according to the scaling function
ρ(p, N ) = (1 + erf(x/1.17))/2 as a function of the scaling
variable x = (p − pc)N 1/2.

The basic ingredient of the model is that the opinion a
social group has on a topic changes when the individu-
als meet to discuss in small groups. To simplify matters,
the model considers that the opinion of an individual
can only take two possible values:
in favor or against.
After discussion, the majority opinion is adopted by all
the members of the discussion group. In case of a tie,
i.e. same number of individuals against and in favor, one
of the two possible decisions is always favored and hence
adopted. This favored decision usually responds to some
sort of social inertia against change. For instance, when
discussing about the reforms in the European constitu-
tion, the opinion favored by the French people was that
of voting against its approval because it was unclear the
advantages that the new constitution would bring to the
French society. The model has been recently modiﬁed in
order to acount for the diﬀusion of the individuals [31]
and the eﬀects of contrarians (people holding a diﬀerent
opinion of that of the majority) [42, 43].

If one assumes that the discussion groups are formed
by taking at random individuals from the whole soci-
ety, it is easy to establish a recurrence relation for the
fraction of people P+(t) holding the favored opinion at
time t. This assumption by which any two individuals
have the same chance to meet in a discussion group be-
longs to the category of mean-ﬁeld approaches, widely
used as a ﬁrst approximation in many problems of in-
teracting particles[44]. The recurrence relation adopts

the general form: P+(t + 1) = F [P+(t)], where F is some
polynomial function that depends on the size distribution
of the discussion groups [21]. The analysis of this recur-
rence relation shows that there are three ﬁxed points: the
trivial ones (which are stable) P+ = 0 and P+ = 1, and a
non-trivial faith point P+ = pc (an unstable ﬁxed point).
Let us denote by p the initial proportion of supporters
p = P+(0) of the favored opinion. If this proportion is
greater than the faith-point value, p > pc, then the re-
currence relation tends to the ﬁxed point P+ = 1 and
the whole population adopts the favored opinion. Oth-
erwise, if P+(0) < pc the fraction of people supporting
the favored opinion tends to 0 as the recurrence rela-
tion proceeds in time. If we deﬁne an order parameter
ρ = hP+(t → ∞)i as the average, over realizations of the
discussion process, of the fraction of people holding the
favored opinion after many discussion steps, the predic-
tions of this simple analysis is that

ρ(p) =

1 if p > pc
0 if p < pc.

(cid:26)

(1)

Since pc < 1/2 it is possible that a favored opinion that
was held initially by a minority, pc < p < 1/2, is in the
long run the opinion hold by the whole population. That
would be the explanation, according to this model, of
the fact that an initially minority opinion can become
majority if the society is allowed to discuss about it for
a long enough time.

This analysis, based on the stability of the ﬁxed points,
is only valid in the N → ∞ limit. In fact, for a small
population, the condition p > pc does not automatically
ensure that the preferred opinion will be the favored one.
There are ﬁnite size ﬂuctuations such that the actual
result of the repeated discussion process is not well es-
tablished if the diﬀerence between the initial fraction of
supporters and the faith point is of order |p−pc| ∼ N −1/2.
This rounding-oﬀ of the sharp transition can be summa-
rized in the following ﬁnite-size scaling law:

ρ(p, N ) = ρ

(p − pc) N 1/2

,

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

a result well conﬁrmed by the computer simulations, as
shown in ﬁgure 2.

It is possible to compute the time it takes the popula-
tion to reach the ﬁnal consensus. According to Galam’s
analysis, the recurrence relation reaches a de facto con-
sensus after a ﬁnite, small, number of iterations. For a
ﬁnite-size population, this can be quantiﬁed precisely [45]
as the number of steps T required for P+(T ) = 1/N or
P+(T ) = 1 − 1/N indicating that the vast majority of the
population has adopted the same opinion. In ﬁgure 3 it
is shown that this time scales as T ∼ ln N . Numerical
simulations, as can be seen in the same ﬁgure, also show
that the time to reach consensus grows near the faith
point; this slwowing down can be understood as initially
the system escapes very slowly from the unstable ﬁxed
point pc. Therefore, the conclusion of this mean-ﬁeld

p = 0.20, 0.10, 0.05, 0.30, 0.60, 0.90. In the inset, the time T is

analysis is that this model displays a true phase transi-
tion between regimes dominated by one or the other of
the two possible opinions. The transition is rounded-oﬀ
for a ﬁnite system and ﬁnite-size scaling laws can be used
to analyze the results in ﬁnite systems.

More dramatic ﬁnite size-eﬀects appear if we go beyond
the mean-ﬁeld theory and consider spatial eﬀects within
the so-called neighborhood models [45]. Contrary to the
previous scheme in which an individual could join any
discussion group, neighborhood models assume that dis-
cussion groups are formed with some criterion of locality
or geographical neighborhood. Some other spatial eﬀects
of this model have been discussed in references [46, 47].
Here we consider that the N individuals are ﬁxed at the
sites of a regular lattice and the discussion cells are well
deﬁned closed, localized, rectangular regions. The exact
dynamics is as follows: at each time step, an individual
is chosen and a rectangle with length sides mx and my
is built around that individual. Both numbers, mx and
my, are chosen uniformly from an interval [1, M ]. The
mx × my individuals on this region discuss about the se-
lected topic and all reach a local consensus based upon
the majority rule, with a bias (favored opinion) in case
of a tie. The opinion of all individuals in the group is
changed accordingly and time increases by an amount
t → t + mx × my/N .

As in the original Galam’s model, a global consensus is
always reached in a ﬁnite time. The ﬁrst feature that ap-
pears in the numerical simulations of this neighborhood
model is the smooth transition between the two diﬀerent
selected states as a function of the initial proportion p

FIG. 4: ρ as a function of p for diﬀerent values of N in the

to N = 106. The main plot shows the scaling law ρ(p, N ) =

of supporters of the favored opinion. This is evident in
the inset of ﬁgure 4, where we plot the order parameter
ρ as a function of p. This looks similar to the rounding-
oﬀ induced by ﬁnite size of the original model. However,
the new feature is that the transition point, deﬁned as
the fraction p for which ρ = 1/2, clearly decreases with
system size N . In fact, a ﬁnite size scaling analysis shows
that the data can be well ﬁtted by the formula:

ρ(p, N ) = ρ(p N α)

(3)

with an exponent α ≈ 0.48 for the dynamical rules
detailed above. The transition point scales hence as
pc(N ) ∼ N −α. An strict statistical mechanics analysis
based on the thermodynamic limit N → ∞ would con-
clude that the actual critical point is pc = 0 and hence
the transition between the two regimes has disappeared!
In our opinion, however, this would be a misleading con-
clusion. There is indeed a well deﬁned transition between
the dominance of the two consensus opinions for a ﬁnite
number N , of the order of magnitude to be encountered
when applying this model to any situation of interest.
In an inﬁnite system, the conclusion is that the favored
opinion eventually dominates regardless the (inﬁnitesi-
mally small) amount of initial supporters. In any ﬁnite
system, though, it is possible to deﬁne a transition be-
tween the two regimes at a value pc(N ). Equivalently,
for a ﬁxed proportion of initial supporters p one could
identify a value Nc(p) separating the diﬀerent consensus
obtained whenever N > Nc(p) or N < Nc(p). Hence,
the change in behavior is induced by the variation of the
number of individuals, N . A result that would have been
missed if we had taken the thermodynamic limit.

FIG. 5: Time to reach consensus as a function of N in the
neighborhood version of Galam’s model, for p = 0.30 (circles)
and p = 0.20 (squares). Two diﬀerent scalig regimes for large
and small N can be clearly seen.

For the neighborhod model, it is possible also to com-
pute the time T it takes to reach the ﬁnal consensus.
Again, the simulations indicate that this time increases
near the above deﬁned transition point pc(N ), and this
critical slowing down is a typical signature of the exis-
tence of a phase transition. In this case, see ﬁgure 5, the
characteristic time scales as T (N ) ∼ N β with β ∼ 0.6 for
N < Nc(p) and β ∼ 0.1 for N > Nc(p). The reason for
these two regimes to appear is that, as discussed above,
the ﬁnal state to which the system approaches depends
on system size: for ﬁnite p < 1/2 and small N the sys-
tem will approach to P+ = 0 (as ρ = 0), but for a large
enough system, the absorbing state will be P+ = 1, and
thus the dependence of T with system size experiments
a strong change.

C. Axelrod’s model

In an important paper [48] R. Axelrod has introduced
a model for the generation and diversiﬁcation of diﬀer-
ent cultures. The basic question addressed by Axelrod
is the observation that diﬀerences between cultures do
not disappear at all despite the fact that people tend
to become more alike in their beliefs, attitudes and be-
haviors when they interact. His proposal to explain this
paradox is a model to explore mechanisms of competition
between globalization (understood as a uniform culture)
and polarization (understood as the persistence of cul-
tural diversity).

In the Axelrod model, culture is deﬁned as a set of
attributes subject to social inﬂuence. Each one of these
attributes can take several traits. The traits change by
social interaction between neighboring agents. The main
premise is that the more similar an agent is to a neighbor,

the more likely the agent will adopt one of the neighbor’s
traits. In this way, the model incorporates the observa-
tion that the communication is most eﬀective between
already similar people. The novelty this model brings
into social modeling is that it takes into account the in-
teraction between diﬀerent cultural features.

More speciﬁcally, Axelrod’s model considers that each
agent is characterized by a set of F cultural features,
each one of them can adopt any of q diﬀerent traits. The
state of agent i is hence characterized by the F vari-
ables (σi1, . . . , σiF ), each one of them can take the val-
ues σik ∈ (0, . . . , q − 1). The number of possible traits
per feature q can be considered as some sort of measure
of the degree of heterogeneity a cultural feature might
have. Agents are located in the sites of a lattice. The
connectivity between the diﬀerent lattice sites deﬁnes the
neighbor structure of the social network. The dynamics
is as follows: ﬁrst, two neighbor agents i and j are ran-
domly selected. One then computes their overlap ℓij or
k δσik,σjk . With a
number of common features, ℓij =
probability ℓij/F , the value of one of the not yet common
features is transferred from one agent to the other, so in-
creasing the overlap by one. This process is repeated by
randomly selecting another couple of neighboring agents.
Eventually, a frozen state is reached in which no possible
evolution is possible. In such a frozen state, neighbor-
ing sites have either an overlap equal to 0 or to F . The
relative size of the largest cluster of agents sharing all
cultural features, Smax/N is a measure of the cultural
diversity.
If Smax = N it means that all agents share
the same cultural features, a monocultural or globalized
state. If Smax = 1 it means that no neighboring agents
share the same culture, a state that can be qualiﬁed as
of cultural diversity or polarized.

P

For ﬁxed value of F it was shown by Castellano et al.
[35, 36] that a genuine phase transition occurs between
polarized and globalized states at a critical value, qc(F ),
of the parameter q. For q < qc(F ) a monocultural state
appears, whereas for q > qc(F ) the society splits in sev-
eral regions each one with a diﬀerent culture.

The analysis of Castellano et al. corresponds to the sit-
uation in which ﬂuctuations are neglected. The situation
is dramatically altered when one considers the eﬀect that
cultural drift has on the dynamical evolution. Quoting
Axelrod: “Perhaps the most interesting extension and at
the same time, the most diﬃcult one to analyze is cultural
drift (modeled as spontaneous change in a trait)” [49].
We have modeled cultural drift by adding one step to
the original Axelrod model: with probability r an agent
changes randomly one of his cultural traits. For ﬁxed
values of F and q a change of behavior can be clearly ob-
served when varying the rate r. A pseudo-critical value
rc can be deﬁned such that if r > rc the ﬁnal state is
multicultural, whereas for r < rc the cultural drift can
not lead the system to develop many cultural states[70].
Note that we have used again the word pseudo-critical
to denote the value rc. The reason, as before, is that rc
depends on the system size N . The exact dependence

FIG. 6: For the Axelrod model deﬁned in a regular two-

is related to the dimensionality of the underlying lattice.
For a regular two-dimensional network of interactions,
it is rc ∼ 1/N ln N [38], see ﬁgure 6, whereas in a one-
dimensional lattice the dependence is rc ∼ 1/N 2[39] as
In both cases, in the limit of inﬁnite
seen in ﬁgure 7.
size N → ∞, the value of rc tends to 0. In this limit,
for any positive value of r it is r > rc and the system
tends to a multicultural state independently of any other
parameters. In the language of critical phenomena, the
cultural drift is a relevant variable since any vanishingly
small value alters the ﬁnal state of equilibrium. However,
in a ﬁnite system there is always a well deﬁned value rc
which separates the transition between polarization and
globalization. Again, an analysis based upon the inﬁnite
size limit would have missed this interesting property of
Axelrod’s model.

Another interesting modiﬁcation of the Axelrod model
considers complex networks of interactions between the
agents. In order to mimic some of the conditions that
a social network has, the connectivity is that of a small
world network introduced by Watts and Strogatz [50]:
individuals are considered to be located in the sites of a
regular network with nearest-neighbors interaction; with
a probability p one of the nearest neighbor links is rewired
and points to another, randomly selected individual, so
establishing a long-distance connection.
In this small-
world network, the phase transition observed by Castel-
lano et al.
is still present, although its exact location
shifts to larger values of the heterogeneity parameter q
as the rewiring parameter p increases. This shows that,

as expected, the enhanced connectivity of the small-world
network favors the globalized state. A diﬀerent scenario
appears in the scale-free networks. Those networks are
characterized by a power law tail in the distribution of
the number of neighbors. The ﬁrst example is that of
the Barab´asi-Albert network[51] which is grown using
the mechanisms of preferential attachment of links. In
the Barab´asi-Albert network, the location of the (pseudo-
)critical value qc depends on system size as qc(N ) ∝ N −α
with α ∼ 0.39. This is a consequence of the ﬁnite-size
scaling law by which the order parameter Smax/N turns
out to be a function of the product qN α, as evidenced
in ﬁgure 8. With the thermodynamic limit in mind, the
conclusion is that the transition betweeen globalized and
polarized states disappears in this case. However, as dis-
cussed before, this conclusion does not prevent the ﬁnite
system from having a true, observable, change of behav-
ior as the parameter q varies. It should be said that the
transition is recovered, even in the thermodynamic limit,
when one considers other types of more complex networks
such as the structured-scale-free networks[39, 52].

III. SYSTEM SIZE STOCHASTIC RESONANCE

It was found more than two decades ago that stochastic
terms (noise) can have a constructive role in non-linear
dynamical systems, [53, 54]. In these pioneer works, it
was shown that the response of a dynamical system to
a weak signal can be improved in presence of the right
amount of noise, but when the strength of the stochastic
terms is too large or too small, such improvement disap-
pears. This phenomenon receives the name of stochastic

resonance.

The original motivation of these works was to provide
a framework in which the small variations in the radia-
tion reaching the Earth from the Sun could be ampliﬁed
to account for the big climatic changes observed in ge-
ological ages. However, stochastic resonance [55, 56] is
now known to hold in a large variety of systems subjected
to many diﬀerent kinds of forcing. The paradigmatic ex-
ample is that of an stochastic dynamics in a bistable po-
tential under the eﬀect of a weak periodic signal. In the
absence of the forcing signal, the stochastic dynamics is
such that there are jumps between the two stable wells of
the potential with a characteristic Kramers time, TK[57].
The role of the forcing is to lower periodically the bar-
rier to go from one well to the other in such a way that
it helps the stochastic dynamics to overcome that bar-
rier alternatively in one direction or another following
the forcing. If the value of half the period T /2 coincides
with the Kramers time, then the external signal is opti-
mally followed by the stochastic dynamics. The match-
ing TK = T /2 can be achieved by varying the intensity
of the noise, in such a way that an optimal response to
the action of the periodic forcing is obtained for the right
amount of noise.

The very general conditions under which the phe-
nomenon can appear has opened a very active ﬁeld of
research. Many other situations have been found where
noise plays a constructive role in a dynamical system.
As in the prototypical example, all that is needed is a
stochastic dynamics acting upon a system with two pos-
sible equilibrium states and a weak periodic forcing. In
fact, those conditions can be further relaxed, an interest-
ing extension being that of coherence resonance by which
an excitable [58] or chaotic [59] system can optimize the

regularity of its ﬁrings under the correct amount of noise.
Similar results have been referred to as stochastic co-
herence in [60] or stochastic resonance without exter-
nal periodic force [61, 62]. Another extension considers
the enhancement of the response to non-periodic forcings,
mostly within the context of some biological applications
[63].

Concerning the dependence on system size relevant to
this review, Pikovsky and collaborators [64] showed that
an extended system can achieve a resonance eﬀect with
respect to an external signal as a function of the size of
the system in a phenomenon that has been named as sys-
tem size stochastic resonance. The explanation is that,
due to the law of large numbers, the intensity of the noise
experienced by the macroscopic variable scales as N −1/2,
being N a measure of the system size. Therefore, the ef-
fective noise intensity for the, average, macroscopic vari-
able can be controlled by varying the system size until
the resonance condition between the Kramers time and
the period of the forcing is satisﬁed. This very interest-
ing result has been recently extended to the system size
coherence resonance phenomenon, with a similar expla-
nation [65].

In the dynamics of social systems, stochastic resonance
was found in very simple opinion models [66, 67]. The
basic ingredients are (i) the individuals of a society can
have a binary opinion (in favor or against) a particu-
lar topic; this opinion can change by social interaction in
such a way that both opinions are equally likely to prevail
(this is the bistability condition); (ii) despite the interac-
tion, individuals might decide to change their opinion in a
random manner (stochastic terms in the dynamics); (iii)
there is an external agent (advertising) that inﬂuences
the opinion of the individuals (a forcing term). Given
the aforementioned conditions, it should be of no sur-
prise that a system size stochastic eﬀect has been found
in speciﬁc models.

This result is quite general, and we now explain in de-
tail a speciﬁc model which displays this eﬀect. We have
chosen a particularly simple opinion model developed by
Kuperman and Zanette[66]. In this models each of the
i = 1, . . . , N individuals of a society can have a binary
opinion, say µi = ±1, on a given topic. The individuals
interact through a network of neighbors. We have con-
sidered both the Watts-Strogatz small world networks
as wel as the scale-free network, constructed with the
Barab´asi-Albert algorithm [51].

The ﬁrst ingredient of the dynamical evolution of the
opinion is particularly simple and it is based upon a ma-
jority rule: at a given time step t an individual i is se-
lected, this individual then adopts the majority opinion
held by his set of neighbors (there is no bias rule: in case
of a tie, a random value for µi is selected). This step,
acting alone, would lead to a society holding a single
opinion, either +1 or −1, i.e, the dynamics is bistable.
The selected value, +1 or −1, depends on the initial con-
dition and the particular set of individuals chosen at each
time step.

7

The second ingredient reﬂects the existence of an exter-
nal inﬂuence agent such as advertising: with probability
|ǫ cos(ωt)| the opinion of the randomly chosen individual
i changes to sign(cos(ωt)). Here, ω = 2π/T is the fre-
quency with which the externally favored opinion changes
with time. This periodic variation aims to reﬂect in some
simpliﬁed manner the periodic variation of fashion.

The third and ﬁnal ingredient of the dynamics is ran-
dom choice. Whatever the results of the two previous
steps, individual i decides with a probability η to change
his opinion to a randomly chosen value.

P

After these three dynamical steps are taken consecu-
tively (in the order speciﬁed above) by individual i, time
increases by a time step t → t + 1/N .

We look at the average opinion ρ = N −1

i µi. In the
absence of the periodic forcing, ǫ = 0, it is found that ρ
ﬂuctuates stochastically between two values close to +1
and −1. In fact, the typical evolution, see the top panel
of ﬁgure 9 is very similar to the stochastic dynamics of
a particle in a double well potential. A characteristic
switching (Kramers) time can be deﬁned as the aver-
age time to jump from one favored opinion to the other.
It is found that this time decreases with noise intensity
η and increases exponentially with system size N . Al-
though the dynamical rules do not allow us to identify a
bistable potential function, it is clear that qualitatively
the dynamics is such that a barrier between the two sta-
ble opinions has to be overcome in order for the society
to change opinion.

This analysis conﬁrms that we have at hand in this
simple opinion model all the ingredients necessary for
stochastic resonance: a bistable stochastic dynamics with
a typical switching time TK. As this time decreases with
noise rate, it is possible to ﬁnd a value of η such that half
the external period coincides with the switching time,
and hence the system responds optimally. This result
was proven in reference [66], although the ﬁrst prediction
for stochastic resonance in a model for opinion formation
was obtained by Baninec in [68]. We show this result in
ﬁgure 10 where we plot the spectral ampliﬁcation factor,
deﬁned as R = 4ǫ−2
hei 2πt/T ρ(t)i
, (h. . .i denotes a time
average). This is known to be a good measure of the
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
response of the system to the forcing signal[69].

The fact that the switching time TK depends on the
system size N , makes it possible to achieve the resonance
condition by varying N . This interesting result shows
that the inﬂuence that the forcing signal has on the av-
erage variable ρ depends on the size N . In other words,
that the eﬀect of advertising is maximum for a popu-
lation of the right size, neither too large nor too small.
This result is shown in ﬁgure 11 where it is shown that the
spectral ampliﬁcation factor R has a maximum as a func-
tion of the system size N . Although this result has been
obtained within the framework of an speciﬁc model, it is
important to realize that it wil also be present in other
opinion models with the same basic ingredients. For in-
stance, as shown in the ﬁgure 11 the network structure is
not a relevant variable here since the ampliﬁcation factor

S (right column). The ﬁrst row (a) shows the dynamics in absence of an external inﬂuence ǫ = 0 in the case N = 100. The

(the sinusoidal thin line in the evolution plots) has a period T = 128. Note that this signal is better followed by a system
with an intermediate size (panel c). This is also signalled by the largest peak of the spectral density at the driving frequency:
Ω = 2π/128.

system size. Of course, the exact value of the optimal
size does depend on the network structure.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we have reviewed some situations in
which system size can have a non-trivial role in some
models of relevance to social systems. The ﬁrst example
was that of apparent phase transitions in the Galam’s
model of biased opinion. We showed in that example
that there is a clear change of behavior in the sense that
it is possible to identify a transition point separating the
two possible ﬁnal opinions. The transition point occurs

at a pseudo-critical value pc for the initial fraction of sup-
porters of the favored opinion. However, the value of pc
depends on the system size in such a way that pc tends to
zero when the system size N increases to inﬁnity. There-
fore, in a strict thermodynamic sense, the transition does
no exists since it does not survive the thermodynamic
limit. This is similar to what happens in one-dimensional
models for the growth of rough surfaces, for which it can
be proven that a change of behavior between a rough and
a smooth phase occurs at some pseudo-critical value of
the temperature. However, in accordance with some gen-
eral theorems, there can not be a true phase transition
in this one-dimensional system.

Next we have unveiled a similar apparent phase tran-
sition in Axelrod’s model for culture formation. Here

the apparent phase transition corresponds to a change
of behavior in the existence of global or multicultural
states as a function of the noise intensity, as measured
by the existence of cultural drift. Again, although a
clear change of behavior can be observed, the transition
does not exist in the true thermodynamic sense, since
the pseudo-critical value of the noise intensity in regular
lattices scales as rc ∝ 1/N ln N in two dimensions or as
rc ∝ 1/N 2 in one dimension. We have also considered the
role of the structure of the social interactions by studying
Axelrod’s model in small world and scale free networks.
It is found that in the Barab´asi-Alert network, a pseudo-
critical value qc for the heterogeneity parameter can be
identiﬁed as separating the regimes of globalized and lo-
calized states. In the thermodynamic limit, qc tends to
zero and the transition disappears.

Finally, we have presented a simple model for opin-
ion formation based upon a majority rule in which it is
shown that the eﬀect that an external forcing (such as
advertising) has on the society depends on the popula-
tion size. A society of the proper size, neither too large
nor too small, would react optimally to a weak signal.

This work has stressed the non-trivial role that the
system size has in the dynamics of social systems. There
are changes of behavior which appear only in ﬁnite sys-
tems. In a strict sense, these changes of behavior can not
be called phase transitions since they disappear in the
thermodynamic limit. However, one can not forget that
social systems are never in the thermodynamic limit and
that those eﬀects can not be foreseen should one insist in
taking this mathematical limit, as statistical physicists
are routinely used to do.

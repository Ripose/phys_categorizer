We propose a many-particle-inspired theory for granular outﬂows from a hopper and for the escape
dynamics through a bottleneck based on a continuity equation in polar coordinates. If the inﬂow
is below the maximum outﬂow, we ﬁnd an asymptotic stationary solution. If the inﬂow is above
this value, we observe queue formation, which can be described by a shock wave equation. We also
address the experimental observation of intermittent outﬂows, taking into account the lack of space
in the merging zone by a minimum function and coordination problems by a stochastic variable.
This results in avalanches of diﬀerent sizes even if friction, force networks, inelastic collapse, or
delay-induced stop-and-go waves are not assumed. Our intermittent ﬂows result from a random
alternation between particle propagation and gap propagation. Erratic ﬂows in congested merging
zones of vehicle traﬃc may be explained in a similar way.

Driven granular media display a rich spectrum of pat-
tern formation phenomena. This includes collective oscil-
lating states, convection patterns, the spontaneous segre-
gation of diﬀerent granular materials, and the formation
of avalanches due to self-organized criticality [1]. Here,
we will focus on jamming and clogging phenomena [2]
related to arching [3], and intermittent outﬂows through
hoppers [4, 5]. Similar phenomena are known from dense
pedestrian crowds [6]. The escape dynamics of individ-
uals from a room has been intensively studied, showing
that in crowd stampedes, rooms are emptied in an irreg-
ular, strongly intermittent fashion [11]. This eﬀect has
been discovered in simulations performed with the social
and the centrifugal force model [11, 12], with cellular au-
tomata and lattice gas automata [13], and in a meanﬁeld
model [14].
It has also been experimentally conﬁrmed
[6, 7]. However, analytical models of escape dynamics
and granular bottleneck ﬂows are lacking.

In this Letter we will formulate such a model. Our goal
is to gain a better understanding of (i) the resulting den-
sity proﬁles and (ii) the irregular outﬂows at bottlenecks.
This includes not only the distribution of the avalanche
sizes in the outﬂow from a bottleneck. We will also oﬀer
a possible explanation of the long-standing problem of
perturbations forming in merging zones of freeway traf-
ﬁc ﬂows [15, 16], which are characterized by erratic, for-
ward or backward moving shock waves [15]. It is believed
that these can trigger stop-and-go waves in traﬃc ﬂows
[15, 17]. Similar ﬁndings have been made in over-crowded
pedestrian ﬂows [7] and expected for merging ﬂows in ur-
ban traﬃc and production networks.

In all these cases, the competition of too many entities
for little space leads to coordination problems. We are
therefore looking for a minimal, common model captur-
ing this feature. Hence, we will ﬁrst abstract from speciﬁc
system features such as the non-Newtonian character of

real granular ﬂows, non-slip boundary conditions, dissi-
pative interactions, or force networks in quasi-static gran-
ular ﬂows [8, 9], and discuss extensions later. This will
allow us to show that intermittent ﬂows are caused even
without mechanisms like dissipative collapse [8],
large
spatio-temporal ﬂuctuations due to force networks [9],
or delay-induced instabilities (as in traﬃc ﬂows). These
may magnify the eﬀect [10].

As pedestrian evacuation has been successfully de-
scribed by driven granular particle models, where a single
particle represents an individual pedestrian, we will for-
mulate a common model for escaping pedestrians and
gravity-driven outﬂows from vertical, two-dimensional
hoppers. Due to the conservation of the particle number,
we will describe the aggregate, two-dimensional particle
ﬂow by the continuity equation for the particle density ρ
as a function of space and time. Both, the shape of a fun-
nel and the semicircular shape of a waiting crowd suggest
to write this equation in polar coordinates. Assuming no
signiﬁcant dependence on the polar angles θ and ϕ for the
moment, we obtain ∂ρ/∂t + (1/r)∂(rρv)/∂r = 0 (gener-
alizing this to a 2d treatment later). Here, t denotes the
time, r ≥ 0 the distance from the bottleneck (exit) and
v ≤ 0 the velocity component in radial direction. The
above continuity equation can be rewritten as

where the term on the right-hand side reﬂects a merg-
ing eﬀect similar to an on-ramp or lane closure term
in a model of
logarith-
mic derivatives, the above equation can be rewritten
as ∂ ln ρ(r, t)/∂t = −v(r, t)∂ ln[rρ(r, t)v(r, t)]/∂r. For
the stationary case with ∂ ln ρ/∂t = 0 it follows from
∂ ln(rρv)/∂r = 0 that the overall ﬂow f πrρ(r)v(r)

(a)

f πrρ(r)v(r) = f πrq(r) =: −Q0 = const.

(2)

q(r) = ρ(r)v(r) is the particle ﬂow through a cross section
of unit length. f = 1 corresponds to the half circumfer-
ence πr of a circle of radius r, while f < 1 allows one
to treat hoppers with an opening angle smaller than 180
degrees. (The walls should be steeper than the angle of
repose.) Q0 ≥ 0 is the stationary overall particle ﬂow.

To facilitate the derivation of analytical results, we will

assume the linear velocity-density relationship

v0 means the maximum (“free”) particle speed and ρmax
the maximum particle density. Eqs. (2) and (3) give the
quadratic equation ρ(r)v0[1 − ρ(r)/ρmax] = Q0/(f πr) in
ρ. With rcrit(Q0) := Q0/(f πqmax) it implies

ﬂow with d|ρV (ρ)|/dρ ≥ 0, the density proﬁle is deter-
mined by the upstream boundary condition, i.e. Q0 is
given by the overall inﬂow Qin. Under congested con-
ditions (d|ρV (ρ)|/dρ < 0), Q0 is given by the overall
outﬂow Qout = min(Qin, 2r0qmax, f πr0qmax),
the
minimum of the overall inﬂow Qin and the maximum
possible overall outﬂow. The stationary case requires
Qin = Qout and a non-negative discriminant in Eq. (4).
large outlets (see
This calls for r0 ≥ rcrit(Qin),
Fig. 1a). Then, ρ(r, t) converges to a stationary free ﬂow
with the density proﬁle ρ−(r, Qin) ≤ ρmax/2. The den-
sity proﬁle for other velocity-density relationships than
(3) can be obtained numerically. Smooth perturbations
like the humps in Fig. 1a propagate forward at the speed
V (ρ) + ρdV (ρ)/dρ = −v0(1 − 2ρ/ρmax) [18], compactify
close to the outlet and leave the system.

i.e.

If the overall inﬂow exceeds the overall outﬂow (Qin >
Qout), particles are jammed behind the outlet (Fig.
1b). The initial density proﬁle ρ(r, 0) again approaches
ρ−(r, Qin) < ρmax/2 in the free-ﬂow regime at large dis-
tances r, but converges to ρ+(r, Qout) > ρmax/2 in the
congested regime upstream of the outlet. The congestion
front moves forward until the jam density ρ+(r, Qout) is
reached. Then, the particles queue up and the shock
front at location R(t) moves backward at the speed

according to the shock wave equation [18] (see Fig. 1b).
Hence, we ﬁnd the free-ﬂow density proﬁle ρ(r, t) ≈
ρ−(r, Qin) for r > R(t), while for r < R(t) we have the
congested density proﬁle ρ(r, t) ≈ ρ+(r, Qout).

FIG. 1: (Color online)Density proﬁles at diﬀerent times, when
(a) the inﬂow is low and the initial density proﬁle has a hump,
(b) the inﬂow exceeds the maximum outﬂow and the initial
density proﬁle is a step function (shock wave). The simulation
results have been obtained by solving the continuity equation
with the Godunov scheme, assuming ρ(12rcrit, t) = 0.01 and
ﬂoating boundary conditions at r = r0 = 2rcrit := 2rcrit(Qin)
in case (a), but ρ(2.8rcrit, t) = 0.1 and Qout = 2r0qmax (corre-
sponding to the maximum outﬂow) with r0 = 0.5rcrit in case
(b). Note that the asymptotic density proﬁle is ρ−(r, Qin) in
free ﬂow and ρ+(r, Qout) in jammed ﬂow.

This applies to cases of continuous outﬂows, which
are observed for large enough openings [2, 12] or small
enough pedestrian velocities v0 [11]. However, if the de-
sired velocity v0 of pedestrians is high, their maximum
density ρmax goes up and intermittent outﬂows are ob-
served [7, 11]. This intermittent behavior (see Fig. 2)
reminds of driven granular media [4] and shall be mod-
eled now. For this, let us subdivide the particle bulk
into shells of thickness ∆r (for example, the particle di-
ameter d or multiples of it). Within each shell of area
A(r) ≈ f πr ∆r, we assume a constant average density
ρ(r, t) = N (r, t)/A(r), where N (r, t) denotes the number
of particles in the shell of radius r at time t. Further-
more, we assume that particles move from one shell to
the next with velocity v0, if they ﬁnd a suitable gap,
otherwise, they will stay. The maximum number of
particles available to move into the shell of radius r is
ρ(r + ∆r, t)A(r + ∆r), while the maximum number of
available gaps in shell r is ρmaxA(r)[1 − ρ(r, t)/ρmax], be-
cause ρmaxA(r) is the maximum number of particles in
the shell of radius r and q(r, t) = 1 − ρ(r, t)/ρmax rep-
resents the fraction of free space. Finally, we assume
that ξ±
r q(r, t) denotes the probability to ﬁnd a suitable
gap in front of a particle allowing it to move, where ξ±

number of outﬂowing particles is Nout(r, t) = ξ−
r q(r −
∆r, t) min[A(r)ρ(r, t), A(r − ∆r)ρmax]. From the balance
equation N (r, t+∆t) = N (r, t)+Nin(r, t)−Nout(r, t) and
ρ(r, t) = N (r, t)/A(r) we get

by −2r0ρ0(t)v0 ∆t (i.e. the exit width 2r0 times the ﬂow

The minimum function in Eq. (6) delineates the merging-

in urban street and production networks. With ∆r =

With the linear velocity-density relation (3), this exactly

in ﬁnding a gap in the next shell, because of coordina-

We expect that a switching between gap propagation
and particle propagation by the minimum function can
account for the intermittent outﬂows of dense granu-
lar ﬂows. Triggered by the randomness of the vari-
able ξ±

avalanches of diﬀerent sizes. The ﬂuctuations ξ±

their average value ξ can be adjusted to experimental
or suitable microsimulation results, e.g.
to reﬂect the

works. Here, we have instead simulated Eq. (6) with

for ρ → ρmax. That is, we have complete clogging, if
r0/∆r < 1/γ ≈ 5/2, which reﬂects arching if the outlet
2r0 is too small (see Fig. 2). Otherwise, if the density
is low or the bottleneck far away, we have p = 1 corre-

We have presented a shockwave approach to deter-

FIG. 2: (Color online)(a) In agreement with an experiment for
granular outﬂows from a two-dimensional hopper [5], our sim-
ulation model generates exponentially distributed avalanche
sizes when frictionless particles with coordination problems
are jamming at a bottleneck (i.e. theory and experiment show
a straight line in a log-linear plot). (b) The standard devi-
ation of the outﬂow, divided by the average outﬂow shows
3 regimes: no outﬂow for r0/∆r < 1/γ = 2.5, smooth out-
ﬂows for large outlets, and intermittent ﬂow in between. (c)
The relative proportion of time steps ∆t with a stopped out-
ﬂow conﬁrms this picture. Our results are quite insensitive
to the selected parameters. For illustration, we chose β = 3,
γ = 2/5, ǫ = 0.01, Qin = 4/∆t, v0 = ∆r/∆t, ρmax = 1/(∆r)2
and, in (a), r0 = 5 ∆r (jammed conditions).

agation, where
V < 0 is the backward propagation speed.
Hence, at bottlenecks we have alternating phases of for-
ward pedestrian motion with speed V and of upstream
dissolving pedestrian jams with average speed
V , where
V and V may ﬂuctuate in space and time.

These formulas are useful for the appropriate dimen-
sioning of exits in order to avoid critical situations in
b
cases of emergency evacuation of people. If the bottle-
neck is too small (and the desired speed v0 of pedes-
trians too high), one may ﬁnd intermittent ﬂows close
to and behind the bottleneck (Fig. 2 b, c). These are
due to the fact that too many “particles” are compet-
ing for a conﬁned space. Obviously, not all particles
can successfully progress, when there are mutual obstruc-
tions. This “coordination problem” has been reﬂected by
a ﬂuctuation factor ξ±
r , the mean value p(ρ, w/(dw/dx))
of which drops signiﬁcantly below 1 if ρ(r, t)/ρmax >
1 + ∆r (dw/dx)/w(x), i.e. if not all particles ﬁt into the
reduced space when progressed by a distance ∆x.

The resulting dynamics is related to a stop-and-go phe-

4

nomenon: In the high-density jam, the velocity is zero,
as the particles cannot move. However, jam resolution at
the exit causes an upstream moving shock wave, in front
of which the density is low. Therefore, particles at the
jam front can leave the jam.
In fact, if the density in
front of the jam is small enough, there is a forward mo-
tion of particles ﬁlling the low-density area. Altogether,
we will have alternating phases of jam resolution and gap
ﬁlling processes close to the exit, which lead to alternat-
ing propagation directions of the jam front. This may
also explain the observed alternation in the propagation
direction of perturbations in freeway traﬃc ﬂows [15].

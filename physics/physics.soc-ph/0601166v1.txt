We discuss a robust alternative to the ex-post decomposition of a portfolio into the fun-
damental law co-eﬃcients using statistically estimated breadth. The breadth of a market
provides a measure of the number of independent bets available to the investor. We use
the Keiser-Gutman stopping criterion to select the integer valued eﬀective dimension -
eigenvalues greater-than or equal to 1. Such a method for the estimation of breadth re-
lies critically on the appropriate estimation of the covariance matrix of price ﬂuctuations
(returns). In a emerging market such as South African it is not surprising to ﬁnd that
the breadth is low because of market concentration, exposure to the global commodity
cycle and currency volatility. The implications of refocussing investment objectives on
eﬀective dimensionality are further discussed.

Keywords: Eﬀective dimensions; Covariance Estimation; Emerging Markets

1. Introduction

One of the most important issues in asset management is the eﬃcient use of forecast
information given constraints on the implementation of portfolios and the nature
of the markets in which the information is to be used.

Constraints, such as no short selling, limitations on turn-over, restrictions in
implementation due to market impact relating to order-size and market liquidity,
and other limitations on the investment style of a manager, all conspire to limit a
managers ability to transfer information into portfolio positions. These constraints
reduce the eﬃcient use of forecast information.

The temporal co-movement of asset classes limit the opportunity set which the
manager has at her disposal. This in turn reduces the managers ability to transfer
asset speciﬁc forecast information into useful portfolio views. The limited eﬀective
dimension of the opportunity set reduces the usefulness of the forecasts and in turn
restrains information transfer.

The relationship that encapsulates the tension between the information content
of the forecast models, the ability of the manager to implement those views, and
the structure of the market is the fundamental law of active management [3,1]. This
’law’ represents the conﬂict between signal quality, the actual value added by the
manager, and the portfolio construction methodology used.

1. The information ratio (IR) measure the signal quality as the correlation between
forecasted residual returns, α, and the realized returns, r: IRt = ρ(rt, αt).
2. The transfer coeﬃcient (TC) measure the eﬃciency of the portfolio construction
is measured as the correlation between active positions, ∆ω, and the forecasted
residual returns, α: TCt = ρ(αt, ∆ωt).

3. The performance coeﬃcient is a measure of the value added and is the correlation
between the active positions, ∆ω, and the realized returns, r: PCt = ρ(∆ωt, rt).

The fundamental law of active management relates the eﬀectiveness of the fore-
casting (IC) in terms of the eﬃciency of the implementation of the views (TC) and
the number of bets actually available to the realized risk adjusted performance of
a strategy,

IR = IC

2. The Fundamental Law

From Clarke et al. [1] we have that the fundamental law of active management
states for Eq. (1.1) that the information ratio (IR) is a function of skill, portfolio
construction and the size of the opportunity set. Here the information coeﬃcient
(IC) is IC = ρ(E[R], r), the transfer co-eﬃcient (TC) is TC = ρ(∆ω, E[R]) and
the performance coeﬃcient (PC) is PC = ρ(∆ω, r). Here the active weight are ∆ω
for the controls ω and are the diﬀerence between the benchmark controls and the
active positions. The returns realized from bets are r, these are the realized residual
returns. The returns expected are E[R] where the expectation is evaluated for the
next time step, we will use this interchangeably with α in the ex-post case to remind
the reader that we are concerned with excess return with respect to some benchmark
portfolio. This is not the CAPM α with respect to the broad market portfolio.

The ex-ante performance coeﬃcient is:

PC = TC

IC.

(2.1)

where the realized performance coeﬃcient is simply the cross-correlation between
active weights (assumed to be risk-adjusted) and the realized residual returns. The
ex-post performance coeﬃcients are found by taking the active weights and the

realized residual returns of the same underlying variables and ﬁnding the correlation
between them. The ex-post decomposition of the performance coeﬃcient requires
the inclusion of a noise term:

The optimal active weights are those determined by some optimal selection
criteria, one such ex-ante deﬁnition of ∆ω is given as ∆ω∗
Σ−1α following the
unconstraint mean-variance criteria. For our ex-post purposes we deﬁne: ∆ω∗ =
r/ P r for all r > 0.

∝

3. Enhancement to the traditional application

Using historical constituent data on an active fund and the corresponding weightings
in an underlying nominated benchmark, as well as historical price time-series data,
we can derive all of: IR, ex-post PC, ∆ω and ∆ω∗. We have two unknowns: the
transfer coeﬃcients and the information coeﬃcients. These need to be estimated
from the complete solutions of Eq. 1.1.

Few fund managers know there transfer coeﬃcients and the only available in-
formation, if any at all, are the rankings of underlying return expectations rather
than the return expectations themselves. We denote the ranking of each underlying
as Ω. The term-structure of the rankings of each underlying is Ω(t) a vector valued
function of term.

The transfer coeﬃcient and the information coeﬃcients are simply scalars on (-
1,1), the product along with the breath explains the information ratio. As a proxy to
’expected risk-adjusted’ returns we simply as Ω. The transfer coeﬃcient is estimated
as ρ(Ω, ∆ω) and the information coeﬃcient as ρ(Ω, r) with three key departures from
convention:

1. Correlation Estimation : Both TC and IC are drawn from the domain (-1,1).
Is there a more rigorous way for the estimation of the correlation function ρ?
Typically a Pearson product-moment correlation is used to estimate TC and
IC. Pearson’s correlation make the restrictive assumption about the normally
distributed nature of the underlying variables. We are dealing with rankings in
the situation where the distributional properties can be argued as being non-
gaussian; we utilize a non-parametric rank correlation. In this regard it becomes
convenient to use the Spearman rank correlation.

2. Independence of TC and IC estimation: It is convention that one coeﬃcient is
derived and the other solved from Eq. 1.1. If both are estimated then inconsis-
tencies will emerge in the fundamental law Eq. 1.1. As we do not know a priori
which is better to derive ﬁrst, we can choose to weight both derivations by their

statistical signiﬁcance. The co-eﬃcient with the greater signiﬁcance will then
dominate the other.

3. Breadth estimation : The key variable is the measure of the number of indepen-
dent bets in the investors opportunity set. Traditionally it has been convention
to use √N as a measure of breath where N is the number of underlyings in
the opportunity set, not the number of independent bets. We believe this to be
ﬂawed, particularly when implemented in markets with concentration or limited
liquidity.

These three departures encapsulate separate debates.
First, the real problem with the estimation of the TC and IC coeﬃcients is the
repeatability of the statistics - the assumed property of scale invariance that renders
interpretation to these co-eﬃcients over time. One can debate the philosophical im-
plications of handling TC and IC in this manner but it should be acknowledged that
we are dealing with several crude estimation assumptions anyway. What we propose
is part reﬁnement (a non-parametric derivation of coeﬃcients using rankings) and
part necessity (weighting coeﬃcients by their t-statistics). The key concerns about
the repeatability of the statistics is signiﬁcantly more problematic when one uses
parametric methods regardless of their statistical signiﬁcance.

Second, we believe that their are better ways to represent independence than
the original construction of Grinold [3]. For our purposes, as well as for ease of
replication, we make use of the principle of ”eﬀective dimensionality”: given a return
matrix X, we us the singular-value decomposition to factorize X as X = U ΣV T
for eigenvectors Σ = diag(Σ) and eigenvalues U . The unitary matrix U spans the
subspace where the variations in the data are the largest. Each eigenvalue has an
associated eigenvector. We then utilize the Keiser-Gutman stopping criterion to
select those eigenvalue greater than or equal to one, the number of such eigenvalues
corresponds to an estimation of the eﬀective dimensions of the subspace - the N in
the fundamental equation of active management Eq. 1.1.

Third, although there are alternative means of deﬁning the eﬀective number of
stocks in a portfolio using entropy measures [7]. These all ultimately revolve around
the degree of localization of the portfolio controls under optimization, and hence
pivot on the appropriate deﬁnition of entropy. Although we do not use this approach
here it is worthwhile understanding the idea - for a portfolio with N independent
bets the portfolio weights would provide a localization proportional to ωT ω where
for an equally weight portfolio ω = 1/N this then results in a localization of 1/N
and for all bets in a single asset, a localization of 1. Localization is a reasonable
proxy for entropy.

For a general portfolio of correlated bets the inverse of the localization gives

a measure of the eﬀective number of asset:
a smaller portfolio with risk-return properties not dissimilar from that of the full
optimal portfolio constituted using the full N assets. This does not necessarily reﬂect
the eﬀective number of bets available, but reﬂects the eﬀective number of bets

required to replicate the optimal portfolio based on a estimated covariance matrix
and vector of views of future asset class performance. One would suspect that ω∗ =
1
λ Σ−1µ for risk aversion λ should provide an eﬀective number of assets comparable to
our deﬁnition based on counting eigenvalues greater than one. However our approach
is not dependent on a required set of asset views.

Ultimately all questions about the eﬀective number of bets are: What is the
smallest M resulting from uniquely arranging N objects (assets) into M clusters
based on the uncertain co-movement of the objects. This in turn implies clariﬁcation
of the notion of measures of co-movement:

1. Which measure of correlation is appropriate to specify object co-movement and,
2. which likelihood function based on this measures is appropriate to specify the

cluster structure.

These questions have been at the heart of a study on South African data by Wilcox
et al [6].

For the sake of brevity, we demonstrate and discuss the reﬁned representation of
breadth below in an empirical example. We would like to open up the debate on our
ideas of more rigorous correlation estimation. Concerns regarding the independence
of TC and IC are already present in the literature [2] - our proposal suggests one
way in which the independence between the two is reinforced.

3.1. Empirical example of the enhanced application

We utilize return data from the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) and the Bond
Exchange of South Africa (BESA) for the purposes of demonstrating both our
breadth computations as well as the evidenced eﬀect of limited breadth within the
South African marketplace. We use daily data for a period of 3.6 years (Jan 2002 -
present) for 37 of the most liquid equity stocks on the JSE. The most liquid equity
index is termed the Top-40 index, but several of the constituents were listed post-
2002. The period of 3.6 years is arbitrarily chosen as a cut oﬀ point where most of
the equity counters currently trading are subsumed in the analysis.

We commence by computing the eﬀective dimensionality of this sample of 37
single-stocks from the estimated correlation matrix. A projection of the single-stocks
(variables) onto the 2-D eigenvector space is represented in Figure 1. The projection
shows that two gold stocks, ANG and HAR, represent a diﬀerent cluster amongst
the group.

A scree-plot is used to map the decay of the eigenvalues by the dimensionality

of the data set in Figure 2.

Using our Keiser-Gutman criterion, we compute the eﬀective dimensionality of
the dataset as no more than 9 dimensions. This translated into an eﬀective breadth
of 3. The conventional use of the fundamental law of active management would
estimate breadth here at √37 = 6, twice that evidenced here.

Next, we repeat the selfsame exercise as above, but now consider jointly the

selfsame period of nine total return series of the seven dominant government-issued
bonds along with our 37 single-stocks. A projection of the underlyings onto the 2D
eigenvector space is noted in Figure 3.

In Figure 4 a scree-plot is once again used to map the decay of the eigenvalues

by the dimensionality of the data set.

The eﬀective dimensionality is estimated as no more than 10 dimensions, trans-
lating into an eﬀective breadth of 3.162. Conventional analysis here would infer a
breadth of 6.6. Note how the analysis suggests both that South African bonds do
not present much of a diversiﬁcation enhancement to an equity portfolio and that
replication of the self-same communalities exist. The reasons for these anomalies
are easily explained by the dominant role that the local exchange rate plays on
both equity and bond valuation and the impact of interest rates and commodity
pressures on both.

4. Conclusion

Breadth in our approach takes on a meaning that is quite diﬀerent from that usually
used, but is closer to the spirit of the idea, as it measures the beneﬁt of real diver-
siﬁcation. The SVD approach to the problem handles independence of the basis of

spanning eigenvectors correctly whereas the notion typically assumed, that gambles
are independent by their very nature, is simply incorrect.

With breadth assuming smaller numbers than most worked examples, TC and
IC are likely to be elevated to explain the same information ratio. This could be
interpreted in terms of the prevalence of active concentrated strategies as opposed
to diversiﬁed active strategies. When the opportunity set is limited one needs to put
in place concentrated bets to achieve the same results. Concentrated bets are known
to push up against investment constraints, this in turn can be used to motivate the
low transfer co-eﬃcients manifested in emerging markets.

It may be that it become more diﬃcult to pick bets that the market will like,
rather than bets that individual agents in the market like simply because fewer bets
are available.

One common criticism with the approach proposed in this paper is that the
coeﬃcients that are derived here cannot be easily compared with previous studies.
This is because treating breadth as the number of independent bets, rather than the
number of bets will generate coeﬃcient’s with diﬀerent absolute values that cannot
be meaningfully contrasted with other studies. Which approach should the diligent
practitioner choose? The debate concerns using a methodology that is more correct
in terms of the interpretation of breadth, or using a methodology that is popular

and treats independence colloquially and incorrectly.

One of the key results arising from this investigation into the fundamental law in
the context of an emerging market such as South Africa is the limitation of breath
in the opportunity set. This breadth limitation is due to a concentration of capital
in a handful of local stocks within the South African market. Some 33% of the
market capitalization is contained in the top-5 underlyings. Interestingly, most of
these stocks are dual-listed overseas, hence further limiting the breadth expansion
when international assets are included in a resident South African portfolio. This
breadth limitation has implications for the variety and nature of the risk associated
with investment strategies.

A common misperception prevalent in the literature regarding the beneﬁts of
diversiﬁcation is that skill is scaleable over breadth (see Thomas 2004). Hence,
diversiﬁcation is a free lunch oﬀered to a ’diversiﬁed’ portfolio in the sense that a
larger number of bets eﬀected with the same skill will produce higher IRs. Hence, a
fund manager with a skill level of getting 60% of his bets correct will have an IR of
0.90 with a portfolio of 20 instruments, an IR of 0.45 with ﬁve bets and an IR of 0.20
with one bet. This scenario is easily proved. However, the error is made in assuming
that one’s IC remains constant as breadth increases. Clearly, it cannot. For every

added dimension of independence, one requires a novel skillset. In the context of
asset management, the implications of this error in the context of a limited breadth
debate is twofold.

First, real diversiﬁcation into breadth to achieve an optimal risk-adjusted return
(IR) requires skill (IC). If IC is compromised by breadth increasing, as we expect
it to be, it can be argued that ’diversiﬁcation’ is actually a recipe for mediocrity
amongst professional fund managers in the most general case. A prefatory analysis
of several South African fund managers show diﬀerent levels and persistence of IC
for diﬀerent sectoral bets. It would be of speciﬁc interest to quantify where the
value resides within such institutions, and how to best extricate this value-add in
the context of a balanced (mutual fund) mandate.

Second, less breadth will exists within any one asset class than the fundamental
law implies. For a unit of capital, shifting allocation within an asset class will
increase the breadth less (if at all) than shifting allocation across asset classes (the
idea of tactical asset allocation). In the context of the South African marketplace,
limited diversiﬁcation exists within a highly concentrated equity market such that a
shift from one security to another represents more of a bet about the relative spreads
between their expected returns than it does anything about diversiﬁcation. In fact,

a pair-trading strategy (in its own right) creates a dimension of independence that
is uncorrelated with either of the two original underlyings, but may be correlated
with other positions.

Lastly, it should be noted that tactical asset allocation can facilitate a rapid
breadth expansion by translating ’possible’ breadth into ’realized’ breadth. The
pros and cons of asset allocation need to be considered in the selfsame context of
the skill that managers have in timing the movements in various asset classes versus
the diversiﬁcation beneﬁts of so doing. In this sense, our proposed modiﬁcation to
the fundamental law of active managament provides a generalizeable framework
in which both static, dynamic and tactical asset allocation can be thoroughly and
correctly investigated. In this context, IC(t), the information coeﬃcient as a function
of term, is the basis on which any analysis needs to be focussed. The prospects of
utilizing the fundamental law in this manner are particularly piquant and we hope
that this research will stimulate some further work in this area.

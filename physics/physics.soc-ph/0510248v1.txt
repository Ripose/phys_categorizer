(Dated: February 2, 2008)

The Harris-Todaro model of the rural-urban migration process is revisited under an agent-based
approach. The migration of the workers is interpreted as a process of social learning by imitation,
formalized by a computational model. By simulating this model, we observe a transitional dynamics
with continuous growth of the urban fraction of overall population toward an equilibrium. Such an
equilibrium is characterized by stabilization of rural-urban expected wages diﬀerential (generalized
Harris-Todaro equilibrium condition), urban concentration and urban unemployment. These classic
results obtained originally by Harris and Todaro are emergent properties of our model.

I.

INTRODUCTION

In this paper we turn upon the seminal Harris and To-
daro [1] work, which together with Todaro [2] is consid-
ered one of the starting points of the classic rural-urban
migration theory [3]. The hypothesis and predictions of
Harris-Todaro model have been subjected to econometric
evaluation and have been corroborated by several studies
[4, 5, 6, 7]. The key hypothesis of Harris and Todaro are
that migrants react mainly to economic incentives, earn-
ings diﬀerentials, and the probability of getting a job at
the destination have inﬂuence on the migraton decision.
In other words, these authors posit that rural-urban mi-
gration will occur while the urban expected wage [12]
exceed the rural wage. From this crucial assumption, as
denominated by Harris-Todaro [1], is deduced that the
migratory dynamics leads the economic system toward
an equilibrium with urban concentration and high urban
unemployment.

In our previous works [8, 9] we analyzed the rural-
urban migration by means of an agent-based computa-
tional model taking into account the inﬂuence of the
neighborhood in the migration decision. The inclusion
of the inﬂuence of neighbors was done via an Ising like
model. The economic analogous to the external ﬁeld in
the Ising hamiltonian was the diﬀerential of expected
wages between urban and rural sectors. Therefore, in
theses works [8, 9] the crucial assumption of Harris and
Todaro were taken for granted.

Now, we are motivated by the following question: can
the crucial assumption and equilibrium with urban con-
centration and urban unemployment obtained from the

original Harris-Todaro model be generated as emergent
properties from the interaction among adaptative agents?
In order to answer this question we implemented an
agent-based computational model in which workers grope
for best sectorial location over time in terms of earnings.
The economic system simulated is characterized by the
assumption originally made by Harris and Todaro.

The paper is arranged as follows. Section II describes
the analytical Harris-Todaro model showing its basic
equilibrium properties. In Section III we present the im-
plementation of the computational model via an agent-
based simulation and compare its aggregate regularities
with the analytical equilibrium properties. Section IV
shows concluding remarks.

II. THE HARRIS-TODARO MODEL

A. Assumptions

Harris and Todaro [1] studied the migration of work-
ers in a two-sector economic system, namely, rural sector
and urban sector. The diﬀerence between these sectors
are the type of goods produced, the technology of pro-
duction and the process of wage determination. The ru-
ral sector is specialized in the production of agricultural
goods. The productive process of this sector can be de-
scribed by a Cobb-Douglas production function:

Ya = AaN φ
a ,

(1)

where Ya is the production level of the agricultural good,
Na is the amount of workers used in the agricultural pro-
duction, Aa > 0 and 0 < φ < 1 are parametric constants.
Similarly, the urban sector also has its productive pro-
cess described as Cobb-Douglas production function:[13]

Ym = AmN α
m,

(2)

where Ym is the production level of the manufactured
good, Nm is the quantity of workers employed in the
production of manufactured goods, Am > 0 and 0 < α <
1 are parametric constants.[14]

Both goods and labor markets are perfectly compet-
itive. Nevertheless, there is segmentation in the labor
market due to a high minimum urban wage politically
determined.

In the rural sector, the real wage, perfectly ﬂexible, is
equal to the marginal productivity of labor in this sector
[15]:

wa = φAaN φ−1

a

p,

(3)

where wa is the real wage and p is the price of the agri-
cultural good, both expressed in units of manufactured
good.

In the urban sector, a minimum wage, wm, is assumed
ﬁxed institutionally at a level above equilibrium in this
labor market. It can be formalized as [16]

wm = αAmN α−1
m ,

such that Nm ≤ Nu,

(4)

where Nu is the amount of workers in the urban sector.
The relative price of the agricultural good in terms of
the manufactured good, p, varies according to the relative
scarcity between agricultural and manufacturated goods.
Then,[17]

The overall population of workers in the economy is
N , which is kept constant during the whole period of
analysis. By assumption there are only two sectors and
rural prices are wholly ﬂexible, which implies that there
is full employment in the rural area, i.e., all workers living
at the rural sector are employed at any period. Then at
any period the following equality is veriﬁed:

In sum, the vector (Nm, Ym, Na, Ya, p, wa) conﬁgures a
temporary equilibrium that might be altered whether oc-
curs a migration of workers, induced by the diﬀerential of
sectorial wages, which changes the sectorial distribution
of overall population.

C. The Long Run Equilibrium

Harris and Todaro, in determining the long run equi-
librium, i.e., the absence of a net rural-urban migratory
ﬂow, argue that the rural workers, in their decision on

migrating to the urban area, estimate the expected ur-
ban wage, we

wm.

(13)

The ratio Nm/Nu, which is the employment rate, is an
estimative of the probability that a worker living at urban
sector gets a job in this sector.

As mentioned before, the key assumption of the model
of Harris and Todaro is that there will be a migratory ﬂow
from the rural to the urban sector while the expected
urban wage is higher than the rural wage. Thus, the
long run equilibrium is attained when the urban worker
population reaches a level such that the expected urban
wage equates the rural wage:

we

u − wa = 0.

(14)

This equality is known in the economic literature as
the Harris-Todaro condition. Harris and Todaro argue
that the diﬀerential of expected wages in eq. (14) can be
a constant value δ 6= 0. When this diﬀerential reaches δ,
the net migration ceases. This generalized Harris-Todaro
condition can be expressed as follows:

we

u − wa = δ.

(15)

The level of the urban population that satisﬁes the eq.
(15), i.e., the equilibrium urban share n∗
u/N , is
determined from the solution of the equation resulting
from substitution of equations (12), (13) in eq. (15):

(N − Nu)1−φ+φγ = δ.

(16)

The solution of eq. (16) is parametrized by the vector
(Aa, Am, ρ, γ, α, φ, wm).

Harris and Todaro [1], in order to evaluate the stability
of the long run equilibrium, postulate a mechanism of
adjustment that is based on the following function of sign
preservation:

˙Nu = ψ(we

u − wa), with ψ

′

((cid:5)) > 0 and ψ(0) = 0. (17)

The diﬀerential equation that governs the state tran-
sition in the model of Harris and Todaro is obtained by
(17). Based on
replacing equations (12), (13) in eq.
this postulated adjustment process, Harris and Todaro
[1] show that the long run equilibrium is globally asymp-
totically stable. This means that the economy would tend

to long run equilibrium with unemployment in the urban
sector generated by the presence of a relatively high min-
imum wage for all possible initial conditions. From now
on we will refer to the long run equilibrium simply as
equilibrium.

Based on the numerical solutions of eq. (16) one can
evaluate the impact that the variation of the minimum
wage and the elasticity of the terms of trade on the equi-
librium. In Figure 1 we see that under the hypothesis of
a Cobb-Douglas technology, the equilibrium urban share,
n∗
u, does not depend on the minimum wage wm. How-
ever, changes in the value of wm reduces the labor de-
mand on the manufacturing sector what results in higher
unemployment rates in the equilibrium.

In turn, as seen in Figure 2, changes in the elasticity
of the terms of trade alter slightly the equilibrium urban
share and unemployment rate. A net migration toward
urban sector shift the terms of trade to higher values.
The greater γ the greater this shift, what cause an in-
crease in the rural wage in units of manufacturing good,

becoming the urban sector less attractive.

the technological parameters, α, Am, and the minimum
wage, wm, which are constants too.

III. HARRIS-TODARO AGENT-BASED MODEL

In this section we describe the implementation of the
computational model we proposed, as well as the aggre-
gate patterns obtained numerically and the comparison
with the respective analytical results.

A. Computational Implementation

Initially, workers are randomly placed in a square lat-
tice with linear dimension L = 500. The reference values
of the parameters used for these simulations are the same
done to evaluate the equilibrium of the Harris-Todaro
model, namely, Aa = 1.0, Am = 1.0, φ = 0.3, α = 0.7,
ρ = 1.0 and γ = 1.0. The value of the minimum wage
used is wm = 0.8 and the initial urban fraction of the to-
tal population is nu = 0.2, where nu = Nu/N is the nor-
malized urban population also called urban share. The
initial value nu = 0.2 is in agreement with historical data
of developing economies. Given these parameters, one
can calculate the vector which characterizes temporary
equilibrium of the system by using eqs. (7-12).

By using eq. (7), the employment level of the urban
sector, Nm, is obtained. If nu ≤ Nm/N all workers in the
urban sector are employed and each individual i earns the
wage given by the manufacturing marginal productivity,
wi = αAmN α−1
. Otherwise, nu > Nm/N there will be
a fraction of Nm/Nu workers employed, which earn the
minimum wage, wi = wm, and (1 − Nm/Nu) workers
unemployed, which earn a wage wi = 0.

u

Each worker can be selected to review his sectorial lo-
cation with probability a, called activity [11]. Therefore,
in each time step only a fraction of workers becomes po-
tential migrants, going through the sectorial location re-
viewing process. Potential migrants will determine their
satisfaction level of being in the current sector by com-
paring their earnings, wi, among nearest neighbors.

The potential migrant starts the comparison process
with a initial satisfaction level si = 0. When wi >
wneighbor the satisfaction level si is added in one unit;
if wi < wneighbor, si is diminished in one unit; if wi =
wneighbor, si does not change. After the worker has
passed through the reviewing process his/her satisfaction
level is checked. The migration will occur only if si < 0,
what means that the worker’s i earnings is less than the
most of his/her nearest neighbors.

After all the potential migrants complete the reviewing
process and have decided migrate or not, a new conﬁg-
uration of the system is set. Therefore, once again a
new temporary equilibrium of the system is calculated
by using eqs. (8-12). The whole procedure is repeated
until a pre-set number of steps is reached. It is impor-
tant to emphasize that Nm is kept constant throughout
the simulation. Its given by eq. (7) which depends on

B. Analysis of the Emergent Properties

In this section we develop the analysis of the long run
aggregate regularities of Harris-Todaro agent-based com-
putational model. These long run properties will be com-
pared between the solution of the analytical model and
simulations we ran.

FIG. 3: Urban share nu as function of simulation steps. From
top to bottom the initial urban shares are 0.9, 0.8, 0.3, 0.2.

Figures 3, 4 and 5 show the basic characteristics of the
transitional dynamics and long run equilibrium generated
by simulations. When the economic system has a low
initial urban share, nu = 0.2 or nu = 0.3, there is a
net migration toward urban sector. This migration takes
the urban sector from a full employment situation to an
unemployment one. The positive diﬀerential of expected
wages that pulls workers to the urban sector diminishes.
However, if the economic system initiates with a high
urban share, nu = 0.8, or nu = 0.9 there is net ﬂow
of migration toward rural sector in such a way that the
unemployment rate of the urban sector decreases. In this
case, the diﬀerential of expected wages is negative.

In an economy mainly rural (nu < 0.5), the transi-
tional dynamics characterized by a continuous growth
of population of the urban sector with a diﬀerential of
expected wages relatively high is followed by the stabi-
lization of rural-urban diﬀerential of expected wages. In
other words, the generalized Harris-Todaro condition, eq.
(15), arises as a long run equilibrium result of the agent-
based migratory dynamics.

Figure 3 also shows that even after the urban share has
reached an stable average value, there are small ﬂuctua-
tions around this average. Therefore, diﬀerently from the
original Harris-Todaro model, our computational model
shows in the long run equilibrium the reverse migration.
This phenomenon has been observed in several develop-
ing countries as remarked in Ref. [10].

In Figures 6, 7 and 8 one can see that for a given value

of α, the variation of wm practically does not change the
equilibrium values of the urban share, the diﬀerential of
expected wages and the unemployment rate. However,
for a given wm, higher values of α make the urban sector
less attractive due the reduction of the employment level.
This causes a lower equilibrium urban share, a higher
unemployment rate and a gap in the convergence of the
expected wages.

In Figures 9, 10 and 11 can be seen that for a ﬁxed
value of γ, the equilibrium values of the urban share, the
diﬀerential of expected wages and unemployment rate do
not have a strong dependence with wm. However, varia-
tions in γ for a ﬁxed wm, dramatically change the equi-
librium values of the variable mentioned before. Higher
values of γ generate a lower urban concentration, a higher
gap in the expected wages and a higher unemployment
rate in the equilibrium.

Finally, in Figure 12 is shown that the convergence of
migratory dynamics for a urban share, compatible with
historical data, is robust in relation to the variation of
the key technological parameters, α and φ.

IV. CONCLUSION

In this paper we developed and agent-based computa-
tional model which formalizes the rural-urban allocation
of workers as a process of social learning by imitation.
We analyze a two-sectorial economy composed by adap-
tative agents, i.e., individuals that grope over time for
best sectorial location in terms of earnings. This search
is a process of imitation of successful neighbor agents.

The dispersed and non-coordinated individual migra-
tion decisions, made based on local information, generate
aggregate regularities. Firstly, the crucial assumption of
Harris and Todaro, the principle that rural-urban migra-
tion will occur while the urban expected wage exceed the
rural wage, comes out as spontaneous upshot of interac-
tion among adaptative agents.

Secondly, the migratory dynamics generated by agents
that seek to adaptate to the economic environment that
they co-create leads the economy toward a long run equi-
librium characterized by urban concentration with ur-
ban unemployment. When this long run equilibrium is

reached, the generalized Harris-Todaro condition is sat-
isﬁed, i.e., there is a stabilization of the rural-urban ex-
pected wage diﬀerential.

Thirdly, the impact of the minimum wage and elastic-
ity of terms of trade in a long run equilibrium obtained by
simulations are in agreement with the predictions of the
original Harris-Todaro model with Cobb-Douglas tech-
nology.

Finally, the simulations showed an aggregated pattern
not found in the original Harris-Todaro model. There is
the possibility of small ﬂuctuations of the urban share
around an average value. This phenomenon is known as
reverse migration.

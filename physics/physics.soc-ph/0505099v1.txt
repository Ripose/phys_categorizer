We introduce a new model that mimics the strong and sudden eﬀects induced by conformity in
tightly interacting human societies. Such eﬀects range from mere crowd phenomena to dramatic
political turmoil. The model is a modiﬁed version of the Ising Hamiltonian. We have studied the
properties of this Hamiltonian using both a Metropolis simulation and analytical derivations. Our
study shows that increasing the value of the conformity parameter, results in a ﬁrst order phase
transition. As a result a majority of people begin honestly to support the idea that may contradict
the moral principles of a normal human beings though each individual would support the moral
principle without tight interaction with the society. Thus, above some critical level of conformity
our society occurs to be instable with respect to ideas that might be doubtful. Our model includes,
in a simpliﬁed way, human diversity with respect to loyalty to the moral principles.

Keywords: conformity, opinion dynamics, social impact.

INTRODUCTION

It is commonly observed that strongly interacting
groups of people may show very abrupt and unexpected
behavior or opinion changes. These ”transitions” may
even lead people to behave against their inmost sense
of good and evil. This is seen in many crowd phenom-
ena, less harmfully, in fashion phenomena, or, more dra-
matically, in the setting oﬀ of civil wars often leading
to despotic regimes. Of course, these phenomena may
have very diﬀerent reasons, but we propose a very simple
model that shows the same features and which may give
some insights on the mechanisms of these regime rever-
sals. Our hope is based upon similarities in the mani-
festations of diﬀerent non-democratic regimes which sug-
gest that similar universal mechanisms may have played
a role.

All those regimes had powerful and merciless mecha-
nisms of repression against people who were either ene-
mies of the regime or merely neutral to it. However, one
could argue that (see, for example, [1]) the stability of
those regimes was not based only on repression. In some
cases, the honest belief of the majority of the population
in the oﬃcial ideas, or, at least the fact that people be-
have as if it was the case, could play a major role. For
example, as soon as this faithfulness became weak, the
Soviet Union fell and the security forces were unable to
stop this process. In many cases these ideologies drasti-
cally contradict the moral principles of a normal human
being. It is reasonable to think that those principles are
shared by a vast majority of human beings. The experi-
ence of the 20th century thus shows that under certain
conditions these principles fail and the behavior of peo-
ple seems to be controlled by some collective phenomena.
Once more, we do not pretend that the model we have

developed explains these historical events. Our modest
goal is to show its analogies with human situations and
to show how conformity can lead to unexpected extreme
and paradoxical situations.

These sociological or historical phenomena are often
sudden, turmoil is drastic, and its apparent cause seems
insigniﬁcant. For a physicist, this problem resembles a
phase transition in a system consisting of interacting el-
ements.
In the system under study these elements are
people and the most important part of their interac-
tion is conformity. Conformity implies the ability, or the
propensity, of people to change their opinion under inﬂu-
ence of the opinions of surrounding people. The confor-
mity may be measured quantitatively by a simple exper-
iment of the following type. A few pieces of paper each
with its own number are demonstrated to a group of peo-
ple. Each piece is either white or black. After the pieces
are removed the experimentalist asks what is the color
of piece #2. In fact, only one person in a group is being
tested in this experiment; the rest of the group are also
experimentalists, though the tested person is unaware of
that. The tested person is asked the question after all the
experimentalist’s team presents the same wrong answer
one after another. This experiment shows how diﬃcult
is to say that white is white after all other members of a
group claimed that the white piece is black. The major-
ity of people are unable to remain true to their conviction
and will give a wrong answer (when the tested persons
are alone, they almost always give the right answer). As
far as we know, these studies began in the middle 50th.
Nowadays they ﬂourish mostly in the purpose of mar-
keting. Now everybody can take a free test to estimate
roughly his/her level of conformity using Asch’s Confor-
mity Study [2]. The role of conformity in a society has
been considered previously [3, 4].

We do not wish to imply that conformity itself is some-
thing bad. This is one of human properties which allows
social life. However, we study below how conformity may
lead to instabilities in human societies.

STATISTICAL APPROACH

Statistical physics is widely used for studying opin-
ion dynamics in society in the framework of diﬀerent
models[5, 6, 7]. There are good reviews of the ﬁeld[8, 9].
Our paper is devoted to a diﬀerent aspect of the prob-
lem, and we use here rather the Gibbs ensemble than
dynamical equations.

Our rough model considers the opinion of the society
with respect to only one statement. We assume that all
previous experience of the society including the inherited
ideas of good and bad dictates a negative opinion with
respect to that statement. However there is a confor-
mity interaction between overlapping groups of the soci-
ety and also there are some individuals who, in spite of
everything, have a positive opinion with respect to the
statement. Their positive opinion is a little bit stronger
than the negative opinion of other people. Following the
terminology of Mobilia [5] we shall call these individu-
als “zealots”. The number of zealots is not ﬁxed and is
determined from the thermal equilibrium. We interpret
the phase transition in this system as social instability.
At small conformity the majority has a negative opin-
ion while at high conformity the opinion of the majority
becomes strongly positive, i.e.
the majority of people
become zealots.

The Hamiltonian of the model reads:

2

second term describes interaction and conformity. It has
a minimum when all qi have the same sign, in other words
when all people think in the same way. Moreover, at any
positive value of α, it prefers all people to be zealots. For
simplicity we consider only the interactions with the four
nearest neighbors on a square lattice and Vi,j = V .

Eq. (1) can be represented as an Hamiltonian of the
Ising model in some ﬁctitious magnetic ﬁeld[10]. Intro-
ducing the new variables Si = qi

FIRST ORDER PHASE TRANSITION

We now show that our system has a ﬁrst order phase
transition. At zero temperature it can be derived exactly.
To ﬁnd the transition point we compare the energies of
the two states. In the state I all qi =

lattice. Variables qi may take values
They represent the opinion of the person on a site i with
respect to a given statement. In terms of the previous
terminology zealots have positive opinions and value α >
0. This parameter describes some extra strength of the
positive opinion, the negative opinion being the ”normal”
one (whether because it corresponds to the true color
of the piece of paper, or to the opinion dictated by the
”universal” notion of good and evil. . . ). In the absence of
conformity (V = 0), at low temperatures all the opinions
are negative (within thermal ﬂuctuations).

that, at low temperatures and low conformity the point

temperatures one can see a wide hysteresis. At higher

MONTE-CARLO SIMULATION AT FINITE
TEMPERATURE

A Metropolis [11] code has been written for the simu-

lation of the Hamiltonian (Eq. (1)) on a 2D (L
square periodical lattice. At each Monte-Carlo step, a
site k of the lattice is chosen at random. The value
of qk of the site is ﬂipped with a probability Pk =

It is well known that, after an initial number of Monte-
Carlo steps that are necessary for relaxation, the averag-
ing of any function of the qi over the subsequent set of
distribution of qi, obtained by this way, is equivalent to
averaging over the Gibbs ensemble. Depending on the
conditions, the operation is performed from one hundred
to one million times per site. The simulation has been
run for diﬀerent values of the independent parameters

Fig. 2 shows the simulation results for

t as a func-
tion of α at diﬀerent temperatures. One can see that, at
the transition, it reproduces very well Eq. (7) which was
obtained at zero temperature (the same result can be ob-
tained writing that at the transition
= 0, Eq. (11)).
The simulation shows that Eq. (7) is applicable over a
wide temperature range. This follows also from the fact
that curves corresponding to diﬀerent temperature cross
at one point in Fig. 1.

However the energy at the transition point diﬀers sub-
stantially from the zero-temperature energy given by Eq.
(8). The transition energy Ht is shown in Fig. 3. To
avoid the auto-magnetisation eﬀect at low temperature,
the initial directions of the spins are sorted at random.

It is also interesting to compare the behavior of the
energy as a function of V
A at a ﬁnite temperature with
the zero-temperature behavior as given by Eqs. (9,10).
These results are given in Fig. 4.

DISCUSSION OF COMPUTATIONAL RESULTS

As far as we know, the Hamiltonian given by Eq. (1)
has never been studied before. At A = α = 0 it coin-
cides with the ferromagnetic Ising Hamiltonian and it has
a second-order phase transition in the two-dimensional
case. We claim that our Hamiltonian has a ﬁrst order
transition at a point given by Eq. (7). It is obvious at
T = 0. Convincing argument is a singularity in the be-
havior of energy as a function of V
A shown in Fig. 4 that
we interpret as a discontinuity of the ﬁrst derivative of
the energy in the transition point. Our understanding
of the hysteresis is that our modeling in real time goes
very slowly and therefore we may see a continuation of

the phase from which we start above the transition point.
That is typical for the ﬁrst order transition and reminds
super-cooled liquid.

On the other hand, we study a very low value of α
and transition occurs at small value of A. Therefore one
should expect that it should be close to the second order
phase transition in the Ising model. Therefore we may
observe clusters of zealots near the phase transition. As
an example the distribution of the zealots at the thresh-
old of the transition is shown in Fig. 5. One can see that
the system has a large correlation radius which is typical
for the second order phase transition. Thus, we think
that we have a weak ﬁrst order phase transition.

CONCLUSIONS

We propose a simple Hamiltonian that models the
drastic opinion changes that can be experienced by hu-
man groups submitted to strong mutual inﬂuence, even
changes that contradict a cultural achievements of the
past. This model shows how, due to the conformity, the
group may express an opinion opposite to the opinion
which each of its isolated members would have. The
model contains the following parameters: T, A, V, α, z
that can be determined by sociological methods. The
level of conformity may be checked by experiments sim-
ilar to those described in the Introduction. The “tem-
perature” of the society could be found by studying time
ﬂuctuations of the public opinion.

Our model is oversimpliﬁed, and the Eq. (7) for the
critical value at the ﬁrst order transition point may be
not accurate. Nevertheless, if the mechanism of collec-
tive phenomenon in the human society can basically be

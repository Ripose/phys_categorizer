Non-Stationary Covariance Matrices And Noise

Andr´e C. R. Martins
GRIFE – Escola de Artes, Ciˆencias e Humanidades USP∗

The exact meaning of the noise spectrum of eigenvalues of the covariance ma-

trix is discussed. In order to better understand the possible phenomena behind the

observed noise, the spectrum of eigenvalues of the covariance matrix is studied un-

der a model where most of the true eigenvalues are zero and the parameters are

non-stationary. The results are compared with real observation of Brazilian assets,

suggesting that, although the non-stationarity seems to be an important aspect of

the problem, partially explaining some of the eigenvalues as well as part of the kur-

tosis of the assets, it can not, by itself, provide all the corrections needed to make

the proposed model ﬁt the data perfectly.

INTRODUCTION

Given a set of data, determining what consists of a signal, relevant to the problem

one is trying to solve, is a very important problem. What part of the data is actually

noise can depend on the question but it is also determined by the model one uses to

ﬁt the data. In the analysis of ﬁnancial series, determining what part of the data,

if any, is just noise and what part involves a real signal can, in principle, make an

important diﬀerence in the decisions to be taken. In particular, estimating covariance

matrices is an important part of traditional methods of portfolio choice [1].

In the last years, this problem has been addressed by using the methods of Random

Matrix Theory (RMT) [2, 3]. The ﬁrst results showed that most of the eigenvalues of

the covariance matrix (except for a few large ones) had basically the same behavior as

∗Electronic address: amartins@usp.br

2

the eigenvalues of a random matrix [4, 5, 6]. Several independent tests, for diﬀerent

markets conﬁrmed those ﬁndings [7, 8], even though, recently, there as been found

some evidence that the ﬁt is not perfect and that the noise eigenvalues seem to be a

little larger than they should be [9]. A possible proposed explanation for this behavior

is that it might be caused by small pair wise correlations between all the assets [10].

It has also been observed that, despite the fact that they are usually considered as

non-existent and only noise, correlations can be measured in the random part of the

eigenvalue spectrum [11, 12].

However, despite the fact that, apparently, much of the covariance matrix seems

to be caused by noise, the eﬀects of this noise on actual portfolio optimization might

not be as important than it would appear at ﬁrst, apparently causing only small

deviations from optimal asset choices [13]. Also, RMT seems to provide a good

way to deal with the problem of the high dimensionality involved in most ﬁnancial

applications [14, 15, 16].

For small windows of time, it has been veriﬁed that diﬀerent behaviors of the eigen-

values can be observed at diﬀerent points of time [17, 18]. In particular, decreases

usually happen together with a strong collective eigenstate, while this collective phe-

nomenon is not so important during increases. This suggests that non-stationarity

might be an important aspect of the eigenvalue problem, as it is in general for ﬁnan-

cial time series [19], despite the fact that most models, for simplicity, do not include

it. It has been shown however, that some of the stylized facts of ﬁnancial time se-

ries, such as the long range dependence in volatility and integrated GARCH [20]

and the changing covariance structure [21] can actually be explained as eﬀects of the

non-stationarity of the series.

In this article, the problem of non-stationarity and its consequences for the eigen-

values of the covariance matrix will be investigated. The question of the meaning of

the noise, measured by the eigenvalues of the covariance, will be discussed and a toy

model for the non-stationarity of the parameters that shows that some, but not all,

of the eigenvalues can be caused by this non-stationarity will be presented.

II. NOISE AND EIGENVALUES

Suppose the real covariance matrix, from where the time series of the prices of N

assets are drawn, is given by the N × N matrix Σ. In order to estimate it, one has

T observations of returns Gi(t), where i = 1, · · · , N, made at diﬀerent points in time

t, from where the sample covariance matrix C can be obtained by

Cij =

where the last term, the multiplication of the average observed returns for assets i and
j ( ¯Gi = P

and similarly for j) can only be dropped if we have renormalized

T

T

the returns so that they have zero average.

In most applications of RMT in the analysis of the ﬁnancial series, the properties

of C are studied, with particular emphasis to the distribution of the eigenvalues λi

of C. Basically, except for a few large eigenvalues, most of the observed values of λi

can be ﬁt reasonably well by the eigenvalues of a random matrix.

The observed property that the eigenvalues of a random matrix seem to ﬁt rea-

sonably well most of the observed eigenvalues in real market realizations of the prices

is usually interpreted as meaning that those eigenvalues are most likely due to noise.

On the other hand, correlations are measurable in this “noise” region of the spec-

trum [11, 12] and it makes sense to ask if, although small, the bulk of the eigenvalues

has some meaning other than noise.

It should also be noted that, in a strict mathematical sense, this interpretation of

the smaller eigenvalues as noise, is not correct, if by noise one means that there are

only a few non-zero eigenvectors, while all other eigenvectors of the covariance matrix

are null. Suppose that all correlations between market prices are actually caused by

a ﬁnite number e of eigenvectors, while all other N − e eigenvalues are exactly zero.

Under these circumstances, random realizations of this stochastic process will not

generate observations with noisy eigenvalues. The real e eigenvalues can be estimated

with increasing precision as T grows, but, even for small values of T , the remaining

eigenvalues will actually be observed as exactly zero. This is due to the fact that the

covariance matrix is singular and assigns zero probability to any observations that

would correspond to everything not covered by the existing eigenvalues. As a matter

4

of fact, even generating those realizations can be a problem, if not dealt with care,

since, as |Σ| = 0, the traditional multivariate normal density does not exist [22], if

one insist on working with N variables. That is, the problem is only well deﬁned if

one uses the eigenstate structure to generate the realization and, by doing so, no new

eigenvalues appear.

This means that no noise appears in the traditional sense, unless the noise is

actually generating new eigenvectors; however, when a covariance matrix is generated

by RMT, non-zero eigenvalues do appear. This means that the meaning of those

eigenvalues must be better understood. When generating the real covariance matrix

by RMT, there is no causal reason for the eigenvalues and this fact is not in dispute.

But the generated Σ matrices do have non-zero eigenvalues. Despite the lack of causal

apparent reasons, those eigenvalues correspond to actual correlations, as indicated by

the results that show that they are actually measurable. RMT actually provides the

average of many possible covariance matrices, each of them with a full spectrum.

That means that, unlike the common use of the term noise, one can not, in principle,

treat the non random eigenvalues as the only real ones and ignore all the others. If

the interpretation of them as noise is to be fully recovered, the origin of this noise

must be better understood. In this paper, the possibility that the non-stationarity of

the parameters might be causing the noise is investigated.

III. THE MODEL

In order to better understand if the noise eigenvalues can be generated by some

simple random mechanism, a model with zero eigenvalues is needed. And, since it has

been observed that non-stationarity can play an important part in this problem, the

model should allow the parameters to change, while providing a realistic covariance

matrix, that is, one that obeys all the requirements for such a matrix.

At a given instant, t, the return and covariance of the N assets will be modeled

by an N × M matrix Φ, with components ϕij, where i = 1, · · · , N represents the

diﬀerent assets and where each value of j, j = 1, · · · , M, M ≥ 3, can be seen as a

diﬀerent possible state of the system. That is, Φ can be seen as a collection of M

5

typical vectors ϕ, with N components. Given Φ, the average return vector µ and the

covariance matrix Σ will be given by

µi = E [ϕi] =

1
M

M

X
j=1

ϕij

M

M

X
j=1

Σil =

ϕijϕlj − µiµl,

(2)

and the observed returns rt, at instant t, are generated, as usual, by a multivariate

normal N(µ, Σ) likelihood.

Therefore, the model will have N ×M parameters, used to obtain the N (N +1)

values

2

of the covariance matrix Σ plus the N average returns µi (even if µi are chosen to be

zero, N parameters will have to be chosen so that the average returns are actually

zero). The conﬂict between a model with fewer parameters and, therefore, easier

to estimate, and one that describes better all the observed facts should be at the

heart of the choice of an appropriate value for M for a real application of the model.

But, since we are interested in understanding the noise by using this model ﬁrst, a

choice of a small value of M, that will generate few non-zero eigenvalues, is the most

appropriate here.

Notice that, as long as M is reasonably smaller than N, there will be less pa-

rameters than in the usual average-covariance parametrization. That means that the

components in the covariance matrix thus obtained are not all independent. As a

consequence, several eigenvalues might be actually exactly equal to zero. This can

actually be understood by a simple counting.

If, per example, M = 4, there will

be 4N parameters in the model. From those, N are needed to specify the averages,

leaving 3N parameters free for the N × N covariance matrix, or in other words, 3

non-zero eigenvalues. This fact can be easily tested with a simple simulation of the

problem, by generating random values for the parameter matrix Φ and estimating

the eigenvalues for it. Simulating realizations from the generated covariance matrix

also shows, as expected, that only the eigenvalues in the real covariance show up in

the sample covariance matrix.

An interesting feature of this model is that one can easily impose a temporal dy-

namics on the ϕ parameters. By doing so, the parameters for the normal distribution

6

of the returns will be altered but all the characteristics of the covariance matrix will

be automatically respected, since the covariance is actually calculated in Equation 2

as the covariance of the parameters. Also, as the parameters are basically typical

observations, it is not diﬃcult to interpret them.

In order to implement the non-stationarity, the model can be altered by making

the parameters ϕ change with time, following a Markov process, where E[ϕt+1] = ϕt

(the index i referring to the assets was omitted by writing ϕ as the vector ϕ).

ϕt+1 = ϕt + ǫ,

(3)

where each component of the ǫ vector follows a N(0, σ2

ǫ )distribution. Notice that this

temporal dynamics doesn’t preserve the average returns. For an average preserving

dynamics, if a value ǫ is added to a component ϕij, it must be subtracted from another

component ϕij′, so that

Pj ϕij will remain the same.

IV. SIMULATION RESULTS

Several simulations were run in order to test the model. In order to have some real

data to compare with, the returns of N = 38 Brazilian stocks were observed daily

from January, 5th, 2004 to July, 28th, 2006, for a total of T = 644 observations. These

set of data shows two large eigenvalues (331 and 102) and 36 other bulk eigenvalues

as shown in Figure 1. Their average (over the assets) kurtosis for this set of data, if

an outlier stock with kurtosis of 580(!) is ignored, is 1.58, with standard deviation of

2.26.

Simulations of 644 daily returns with N = 38 assets, M = 4 (three non-zero

eigenvalues) and values of σǫ ranging from 0 to 0.45 (where 1 would mean a random

walk with a daily standard deviation of 1% for each of the values of the parameters)

were performed and each case run 100 times in order to obtain average results. The

initial values of the parameters were drawn randomly from a multivariate normal

distribution with zero average and covariance matrix equal to the sample covariance

matrix of the Brazilian assets, so that the comparison between the simulated results

and the real data made sense.

7

The observed kurtosis, as a function of σǫ can be seen in Figure 2. As soon as some

non-stationarity is introduced in the problem (σǫ 6= 0), the kurtosis becomes greater

than zero, as expected, but, in order to reach values closer the observed values in

Brazilian data, σǫ would have to be too large. Notice that a value of σǫ = 0.5

means that the average daily return would oscillate with a standard deviation of

0.5/q(4) = 0.25, a value too large to be believable. That is, although this model can
explain part of the kurtosis, it certainly can’t explain all of it.

The eigenvalues of the observed returns were also recorded and the average values

for those eigenvalues calculated. In order to obtain the averages, the eigenvalues were

ranked from larger to smaller, so that the averages refer to the largest eigenvalue,

second largest and so on. The eigenvalues can be seen, as a function of σǫ, in Figure 3.

It is interesting to notice that a few bulky eigenvalues are generated even for smaller

values of σǫ. The ﬁrst bulky Brazilian eigenvalue was around 12 and such a value is

obtained as a non-stationary eigenvalue for σǫ as small as σǫ = 0.1. However, unless

σǫ is much larger, most non-stationary observed eigenvalues are close to 0, something

that is not observed for the real data, in Figure 1. That is, once more, the non-

stationarity provides corrections to the model in the right direction, but not as much

as it should in order to account for the eigenvalues.

One interesting consequence of these observations is that, since zero eigenval-

ues would mean zero eigenvalues in the sample covariance matrix and since non-

stationarity can only explain part of the eigenvalue spectrum, this seems to support

the idea that there are correlations even in the smaller eigenvalues. Those correla-

tions might not be large and, in part, the eigenvalues can be due to non-stationarity.

But at least part of them seems to be real. On the other hand, the fact that all cor-

rections introduced by the non-stationarity are in the right direction, seems to show

that the change of the parameters in time is something that should be taken into

account in every description of this problem and further inquiry into consequences of

the non-stationarity is needed.

Abstract

Random graphs are useful tools to study social interactions. In particular, the use of
weighted random graphs allows to handle a high level of information concerning which
agents interact and in which degree the interactions take place. Taking advantage of this
representation, we recently deﬁned a magnitude, the Social Inertia, that measures the
eagerness of agents to keep ties with previous partners. To study this magnitude, we used
collaboration networks that are specially appropriate to obtain valid statistical results due
to the large size of publically available databases. In this work, I study the Social Inertia
in two of these empirical networks, IMDB movie database and condmat. More speciﬁcally,
I focus on how the Inertia relates to other properties of the graphs, and show that the
Inertia provides information on how the weight of neighboring edges correlates. A social
interpretation of this eﬀect is also oﬀered.

INTRODUCTION

The theory of complex networks has recently produced a great deal of interest in a very
multidisciplinary community (for recent reviews on the ﬁeld see [1–4]). It has been applied
with success to a number of ﬁelds spanning from the Internet and the World-Wide Web [5–7]
to protein interactions in cells [8–10]. The study of human society is another topic where
networks can play an important role. In this particular case, the vertices represent individuals
and the edges social interactions such as professional, friendship, or family relationships. These
interactions can appear on diﬀerent levels of intensity. How strength our friendship with other
person is cannot be seen as a white-and-black concept but as a full scale of colors. This means
that the best networks to characterize social interactions are weighted graphs. Weighted graphs
include a magnitude associated to the edges, a so-called weight, that accounts for the quality
of each connection [11]. Here I will apply the mathematical tools designed for weighted graphs
to collaborations networks.

So far the major problem for the study of social networks has been the absence of large
enough databases from which reliable statistical conclusions could be extracted. However,
on the edge of the digital era, this restriction does no longer exist for a particular kind of
social networks, the so called collaboration networks. This type of networks are obtained from
public databases containing artistic or scientiﬁc productions such as books, movies or papers,
together with the names of the people authoring those works. The network is then formed by
connecting together pairs of persons who have co-authored a common work [5, 12]. This graph
is undirected, the relations are reciprocal, and it may be weighted. The weights can be used

to represent how many times a certain partnership has taken place, maintaining thus a high
degree of information in a single graph [12,13]. Recently, we exploited the information contained
in the weights of the links to deﬁne a new quantity, the Social Inertia, which measures the
eagerness of the authors to keep working over and over with the same team [14]. My intention
in this paper is to study in detail the foundations of this magnitude and to show why it gives
new information diﬀerent from previous metrics. In order to illustrate these points, I will use
networks obtained from the IMDB movie database [5, 15] and from condmat [12]. The IMDB
database comprehends 383640 actors and 127823 movies, while the data from condmat contains
16721 authors and 22002 papers.

2 SOCIAL INERTIA

Let us start by considering a network where the nodes are authors or actors, the edges represent
partnerships and the weight of the edges, wij for a link between i and j, the number of times a
co-authorship between authors i and j has been repeated. The degree of a node i, the number
of connections ki, corresponds to the number of diﬀerent coauthors a particular actor has had.
Another important magnitude is the strength si, which is the sum over all the weights of the
links of node i. In our case, si is the total number of partnerships i had. The social inertia for
i is then deﬁned as

Ii = si/ki,

(2.1)

and accounts for how many of the partnerships have taken place with diﬀerent partners. Ii
measures the level of conservatism of i, how open he or she is to collaborate with diﬀerent
people. Its limits are Ii → 1 if the actor has never repeated collaborators, and Ii → qi if all
her works were carried out with the same team, where qi stands for the total experience of i
(number of works she has authored).

3 RELATION BETWEEN THE INERTIA AND OTHER PROPERTIES OF NETWORKS

The Inertia is the average weight of the links of a node, Ii = si/ki = (1/ki) Pj∈ν(j) wij where
ν(i) represents the set of ki neighbors of i. If we consider a network where all the weights are

Fig. 2. Average Inertia and standard deviation as functions of the degree. The data in a) are for
the actor network and those in b) for the condmat. The blue diamonds correspond to the random-
ized networks obtained switching the values of the weights of the links of the original networks (see
explanation in the text). The two straight lines represent the predicted k−1/2 decay for uncorrelated
networks.

alike, the Inertia is a constant. Unweighted graphs are a particular case of this situation with
Ii = 1 for all i. If there exist a weight distribution in the graph Pw(w), then the values allowed
to I depend on how wide such distribution is. For distributions with a ﬁnite second moment
and for nodes with high degrees k, the Central Limit Theorem implies that their strengths
must show a Gaussian distribution around a central value hsi(k) and that the deviation of this
distribution should grows as σs(k) ∼ k1/2 with the degree. This leads in turn to a Gaussian
distribution of the ﬂuctuations of the Inertia of nodes with the same degree k, with the standard
deviation decreasing with the degree as σI (k) ∼ k−1/2. In other words: the Inertia should be
better and better determined, the larger the degree of a node becomes. If the degree of a node
is known, there remains almost no uncertainty in its value of the Inertia (specially if its degree
is high). This argument seems to establish that the Inertia is a magnitude dependent of others
as the degree, but is it really like that in real-world networks?

∞

In order to give an answer to this question, I have plotted in Figure 1a the cumulative weight
w dw′P (w′)) for both empirical networks (actors and condamt). For
distribution (C(w) = R
the two examples, the weight distribution is wide but decays faster than C(w) ∼ w−2, which
implies that these distributions have ﬁnite second moments. However, as can be observed in
Fig. 1b, the distribution of values of inertia for nodes with a given value of the degree, Pk(I),
does not tend to a Gaussian form for high values of k. Otherwise, the curves in Fig. 1b should
tend to a parabola when k increases. This fact is in contradiction with the argument above.
Another point of conﬂict is its ﬁnal prediction for the Inertia: the deviation of the values of
I for nodes with a certain degree k, σI (k), does not decay as k−1/2 for any of the networks
studied. Instead, it grows for the actor network, see Figs. 2a, and remains almost constant for
the condamt (Fig. 2b). This leads to a kind of indetermination rule: for the actors, the higher
the degree of a node is, the less we know a priori about its possible value of the Inertia. And
for the condmat, knowing the degree does not tell us anything about the Inertia. The values
of the average Inertia as a function of the degree is also represented in the same Figures and,
in contrast to what happens in transport networks [13], it does not change signiﬁcantly.

One may wonder then what these networks have in particular to show this behavior. The
answer is profusely discussed in Ref. [17] and is related to the fact that the weights of the edges
are not randomly distributed. The edges of a node tend in general to be uniform, more than

Pr1-4

in a purely random distribution. These correlations imply that nodes with the same degree
can have very diﬀerent values of the strength and consequently vary in the Inertia. Weak
links are concentrated in certain areas of the network and the same happens with the strong
links. To illustrate this mechanism, I have disordered the weights of the links: maintaining the
same topological structure of the network, the weight of each link is interchanged with that
of another randomly chosen edge. The eﬀect on σI (k) can be seen in Figs. 2a and 2b. For
the randomized networks, the deviation decays as k−1/2 following the prediction done by the
argument discussed above for uncorrelated graphs.

From the social perspective, this eﬀect means that the authors or actors display a tendency
towards keeping their partnerships in relative similar levels. Some people are quite faithful and
go on repeating with the same collaborators, others change of collaborators with high frequency
and do not maintain a partnership for very long. These are the two extremes but of course
there is a full scale of behaviors for the agents in the middle. However, extreme conducts are
here more likely than in a completely random situation. Consequently, even if the number of
diﬀerent partners is the same for two actors, it is not easy to predict to which category they
belong. The diﬃculty of doing so may even increase with an increasing number of partners.

4 CONCLUSIONS

In summary, I have studied here how the Inertia, the average weight, of the nodes relates
to other magnitudes in social networks. A very simple theoretical arguments suggests that
knowing a certain magnitude as the degree, one has the Inertia of a node speciﬁed. I have
checked the validity of this argument in two real-world social networks: the IMDB movie
database and the condmat. Both of these cases show that the theoretical prediction fails. The
reason for the failure is the existence of weight-weight correlations in real networks. This fact
implies that the distribution of the Inertia contains important information on the behavior of
the agents. From a social point of view, the existence of these correlation indicate the presence
of two diﬀerent type of behaviors. Some agents are faithful to their partners and maintain in
average a high level of collaboration with them, while others have a tendency to change quickly
their collaborators without allowing the partnerships to go too far.

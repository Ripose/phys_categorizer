The deﬁnition of preferences assigned to individuals is a concept that concerns many disciplines,
from economics, with the search of an acceptable outcome for an ensemble of individuals, to decision
making an analysis of vote systems. We are concerned in the phenomena of good selection and
economic fairness. In Arrow’s theorem this situation is expressed as the impossibility of aggregate
preferences among individuals falling down into some unfairness state. This situation was also
analyzed in a previous model in a network of individuals with a random allocation [8]. Both analysis
are based on static preferences.

In a real society the individuals are confronted to information exchange which can modify the way
that they think. Also, the preference formation of each individual is inﬂuenced by this exchange.
This consideration reveals why the actual theory is not able to make an accurate analysis of the
inﬂuence of the individual, or cluster of individuals, in the fairness state. The aim of this investiga-
tion is to consider the coupling of two systems, one for the formation of preferences and a second
where an allocation of goods is done in an evolutionary environment.

INTRODUCTION

Commonly, envy is considered as a feeling with a negative character that aﬀects the social relation between indi-
viduals. The measure of the inﬂuence of this feeling into the social systems, i.e., the way that it inﬂuence the choice
and the change of preferences in time, can be explained from a behavioristic point of view explaining, by means of
diﬀerent approaches, the inﬂuence of feelings at the moment of choice. Emotions act as a motor for consume and
social relations help to improve the satisfaction level and adjust processes can be considered as important ingredients
to achieve low envy levels in the society.

In conventional models the preferences are constant in space and time. The individuals are able to set an own
preference list with a particular rank in order to achieve the highest satisfaction level. Using these lists they orient
themselves in order to get a bundle of goods. We avoid the problem of prices by introducing an assignation mechanism.
When an individual does not acquire her/his desired goods, then she/he start to looks into the neighbor’s basket.
When the individual ﬁnd out the searched good into her/his neighbor’s basket an envy relation is bearing [8]. The
number of comparisons is unlimited and is used as a measure of time. Therefore, we can state that envy relations
have a dynamical nature.

This dynamic takes place in a behavioral sphere, just before any transaction between individuals, and its presence
aﬀects, beyond the market, the existent economical and social systems. The emergence of envy, among other feelings,
between individuals provide an ideal ﬁeld which allows the exchange of goods [10][9]. Following Simon [11], the
individuals are doted with bounded rationality and doesn’t believe in preference or utility relations. That means, the
choice is not deterministic and normally, incomplete information is present. The develop of own beliefs to improve the
choice has a temporal sense. Furthermore, talk about preference or utility has no sense, and the idea is better related
with satisfaction. The change of believes has no dependence on typical scales of time, but on times of interpersonal
comparisons.

In the real world, preferences and satisfaction levels change in time due externalities (i.e., Marketing, fashion,
introduction of new products, but also social interaction as cooperation, and other issues as altruism or donations)
and internal or behavioral inﬂuences -Menger’s proposition as explanation of changing and evolution of preferences
(Menger, 1950)-, demand for innovations[12], demonstrated dissatisfaction with consumed goods, desire of diﬀerenti-
ation, and possession of a veil of ignorance [9], individuals must permanently change the way they choose. Therefore,
a kind of ’elastic preferences’ must be introduced in order to achieve the highest satisfaction level, allowing its change
in time.

In this investigation we show a slight modiﬁcation of a previous model [8] and propose a system where the individuals
try to adapt their preferences in order to avoid envy, like a system that adapts itself to the environment and will avoid
posterior exchange of goods. The second part provides the model and consider plastic preferences into the baseline
of the envy mechanism. Additionally, we explain the simulation method we developed. In the third part we discuss
our results. Main conclusions and outlook are provided in the last part.

II. MODEL

A. Rigid preferences

Principally, we need three elements to built our model: the ﬁrst one is a set of various goods of K diﬀerent kinds
located in a ’store’. For each kind k of goods, a speciﬁc number G(k) of goods exists. Our second element is a set
of individuals. There are N individuals in our model. Each individual i has a preference list Pi of her/his preferred
goods. This preference list Pi can be coded as a permutation of the numbers 1, . . . , K with Pi(1) being most important
good for individual i, Pi(2) being the second important good, and so on. The third element is a set of individual
’baskets’ Bi in which the individuals can store their goods after picking them up from the set of goods in the store.
Thus, Bi(k) denotes the number of goods of kind k the individual i has got in her/his basket.

According to their individual preferences, the individuals search for goods of their highest ranked preference type in
the available set of goods. Every individual is allowed to take an overall number M of goods. If the highest preferred
good is no more available, the individual starts to collect the second good on her/his preference list, and so on. Each
individual takes the goods from the set of goods into her/his basket. Several individuals enter the store in a random
order. The ﬁrst individual according to this randomly created queue takes M stored goods (for example motorbikes,
computers, etc.) into her/his basket. Then she/he leaves the store and the second individual in the queue enters the
store. She/he also takes M goods, selecting them according to the preference list she/he has in mind, and leaves the
store. This is repeated until the N individual searches into the remaining M goods. After all the goods have been
picked up by the individuals, the following equation holds

with G(k) being the number of goods of kind k in the store before the ﬁrst individual has entered the store to take
some goods into her/his basket. R are the remaining goods in the store that any body wants. The existent number
of goods is just suﬃcient for the individuals in our model and can also be written as

There is no production or destruction of goods. The number of individuals also remains constant. So, when the
individual takes a good into her/his basket, there is a depletion of one good in the store.

We deﬁne the distribution of the number of goods G(k) according to a distribution function that is more or less

uniform. The best suited function in this case is a Gamma function [8][3] deﬁned by

where k0 is the index of the good that is peaked around the distribution and Γ(A) is the gamma function. In this
equation the parameter A is the amplitude of the Gamma distribution, i.e. the variation of this parameter produces
a more or less uniform initial distribution of goods in the store.

After the distribution of goods, the individuals are allowed to take a look into the baskets of some other individuals
and to compare their own goods with the goods of these other individuals according to their own preference lists.
Some individuals are satisﬁed because the contain of their baskets ﬁt their own preference lists, while other individuals
are missing goods to reach this satisfaction. In this case, envy emerges. Formally, envy can be deﬁned in the following
way: two individuals i and j are randomly chosen. They are allowed to look into the baskets of each other. Of course,
they ﬁrst check for the goods on top of their preference lists. Now if individual i sees that Bj(Pi(1)) > Bi(Pi(1)),
i.e., that individual j has more of the good on top of her/his preference list than himself/herself, then individual i
feels an emergence of envy. Contrarily, if Bj(Pi(1)) < Bi(Pi(1)), i.e., if individual j has less of the good on top of
the preference list of individual i, then individual i is satisﬁed. In the case that Bj(Pi(1)) = Bi(Pi(1)), individual i

3

checks for the second good on the preference list. Here again individual i might get satisﬁed if Bj(Pi(2)) < Bi(Pi(2)),
envious if Bj(Pi(2)) > Bj(Pi(2)), or willing to inspect the basket according to good Pi(3) if Bj(Pi(2)) = Bi(Pi(2)).
This process is repeated till the baskets are equally ﬁlled with goods of higher ranking. In the special case that both
baskets are identical, no envy occurs. We can write this envy relation of the individual i might feel towards individual
j formally as

Ei(j) =

Θ(bj(Pi(k)) − bi(Pi(k))) ×

δ(bi(Pi(l)), bj(Pi(l)))

with Θ(x) the Heaviside function and δ(x, y) the Kronecker symbol. Note that the addend for k = 1 in Eq. (4) is
well-deﬁned as the empty product

0
l=1 . . . has a value of 1.

At the same time when individual i looks into the basket of individual j, individual j looks into the basket of
individual i. Given that the initial preference lists Pi and Pj of individuals i and j are diﬀerent, three diﬀerent cases
can occur: either none of them feels envy, as both of them are satisﬁed due to their diﬀerent preference lists, or exactly
one of them feels a local emergence of envy, while the other one feels satisﬁed, or both are envious towards each other.
Each individual is allowed to make f “visual contacts” with other individuals looking into their baskets. The
random selection of pairs of individuals leads to a random network [1]. Please note that all edges in this network are
undirected, i.e., if there is an edge from individual i to individual j, also the edge from j to i exists. This random
network can simply be described via a symmetric edge matrix η, where η(i, j) = 1 if an edge between i and j exists
an 0 otherwise.

After the edges have been chosen, we can deﬁne a Hamiltonian E for this network of individuals, summing up the

amount of envy occurring in this network:

Note that the value of E is usually diﬀerent from the number NE of envious individuals, which is given by

E =

,

as a ’dog in the manger’ can feel envy towards more than only one other individual. An envy network is created due
to the assignment of goods to the baskets of the individuals, who make comparisons based on their own preferences,
and emerges only when the system is out of a Walrasian equilibrium, i.e. when there is a bad allocation of goods.
Our model is not a typical optimization problem, in which the global optimum of a proposed pay-oﬀ function (free
energy for instance) has to be found. When individuals try to ﬁnd a solution which is optimal for themselves, this
solution, which is called Nash equilibrium, might not be a global optimum of the whole problem [5]. Here, our pay-oﬀ
function, which determines the amount of envy, is a measure of how far the system is from the equilibrium state. So,
we analyze the connectivity dependence on the assignation of goods and the number of individuals that express envy.
Search the fairness state, and not the topology of the network, is the main problem in this investigation [7]. Our
particular interest is the measurement of the number NE of individuals with envy. For this reason, envy is rescaled by
the total number of edges in the network divided by the total number of nodes (individuals). There is a fairness state
when there are no connections between the nodes of the random network, then E = 0. Otherwise, we recognize the
emergence of an envy state. This network represents the bidirectional exchange of information between individuals,
i.e., each individual looks into the basket of the other individual searching for goods of her/his own preference. Because
they can look at but not remove goods from the basket of the other individual or exchange goods, the envy relation
due to interpersonal comparisons cannot be resolved.

B. Plastic preferences

Now we introduce the possibility that individuals adjust permanently their preference lists after compare the
obtained bundle by a ﬁrst distribution, when the desires satisfaction level is not achieved. Two fundamental variants
can be adopted: either the individuals set complete new preferences, or learn and try to adapt themselves their
behavior. The ﬁrst one corresponds to a random way to change the way to think, whereas the second imply a learn
process that imply the possibility to recover information of previous allocation processes. In both cases, the formation
of new preferences evolves, conform the system also evolves and does not imply the exchange of information between

individuals, or between the store and the individuals, before the allocation process takes place. We studied the ﬁrst
variant because we want to understand the eﬀect that an impulsive individual has into the envy network.

This process implies the introduction of an additional transition probability for the preference list into the whole
dynamics of the system. Therefore, a second preference list is randomly created after the individual compare the
obtained bundle with her/his neighbors in order to improve her/his obtained bundle. If her/his neighbor has the
good that the individual wants to have, but she/he could not obtain, the individual sets a new preference list. The
process of setting preferences lists can be done only once before the new distribution, when individuals are able to
check their own satisfaction level and compare the obtained bundles in between one more time. A new envy relation
can be established if the individuals are not satisﬁed and must go to search again the source that can remove the
deprivation feeling.

FIG. 1: Correlation of the number of individuals that express envy as a function of the comparisons times f , for individuals
with plastic preferences (non normalized). We compare this result with a typical relaxation process for individuals with non
plastic (rigid) preferences.

The initial conditions assumes that all the individuals are in a non-envy-state. When the assignation starts, and the
preferences are non plastic, then a relaxation process in the correlation function of the number of envious individuals
takes place through envy interactions and the number of envious individuals looses the correlation with the initial
state. For inﬁnite times the system eventually reaches an equilibrium state. In a social system this process can be
seen as a group of individuals meeting their selves with empty baskets and lists of preferences in a market. After a
distribution process, the individual test their satisfaction level comparing the acquired goods with their preference
lists. In order to avoid envy relations, the switch-on of the plastic preferences introduces an additional interaction
represented by a transition of the preferences of the individuals. The eﬀect of this transition process is observed as a
kind of additional force that introduces an arrest into the system and an over-relaxation in the correlation function
of envious individuals (See Fig. 1).

III. RESULTS

We performed simulations with N = 100 individuals and K = 100 diﬀerent kinds of goods. Given that the system
is closed (there are no changes in the numbers of goods and the preferences remain the same) then the system must
reach an equilibrium state in the distribution of envy and envious individuals for f → ∞, i.e. we assume a system
where envy can ’diﬀuses’ in a set of individuals.

The envy relation grows according to the increment of the number f of interpersonal comparisons. A ﬁrst analysis
made for rigid preferences is shown in Fig. 2. The ﬁt of the curves show that E ∼ f 1, which corresponds to a diﬀusive
regime. That means, for non plastic preferences and inﬁnite times the system relaxes in an statistical equilibrium
with diﬀerent levels of envy. However, when the preferences are plastic the system relaxes much faster (Fig. 3). Here,
the curves can be ﬁtted with E ∼ f p, and p < 1.

This results imply, the system is in a sub-diﬀusive regime, i.e, the system is subjected to dissipative forces (similar
to the forces that produce an arrest of diﬀusing molecules in complex liquids [4][2]), i.e., the introduction of random
plastic preferences act as an additional force in the individuals, which avoids the free diﬀusion of envy among the
system.

FIG. 3: Mean of the envy for a set of individuals in a closed system for two diﬀerent distribution amplitudes A = 1 and A = 5
as a function of the comparisons times f . In this case the individuals have “plastic random” preferences, i.e., each individual
changes its preference list in a random way when she/he has not acquired the goods they want.

A very interesting scenario appears for the number of individuals expressing envy. With rigid preferences there is
a relaxation process, from individuals expressing an initial anxiety to individuals that express some satisfaction level
after an allocation process has been done (Fig. 1). The autocorrelation function of density of individuals expressing
envy can be ﬁtted only for short times using an exponential function. However for intermediate time regimes the
correlation function reaches a value equal to zero. Thereafter, this function relaxes to an equilibrium point. For this

reason this curve can be ﬁtted with an exponential function (typical for stochastic systems in equilibria) for both short
and upon intermediary and long time regimes. But the null values of the correlation function shows a tendency to a
convolution of the correlation with a memory function (as is shown ﬁtted in the insert of Fig. 1), an eﬀect that can
be much stronger for individuals able to learn. Our interpretation is supported by the theory of correlation functions
for complex liquids [13]. We speculate that a system with non plastic preferences has a tendency to a non trivial
relaxation function, i.e., individuals try to conserve their initial condition of non-envy. The distribution of goods is a
force that drives this system, enforcing it to reach an statistical equilibrium.

FIG. 4: Number of individuals feeling envy as a function of the comparisons time f . The ﬁrst plot is a representation of the
relaxation of individuals that express envy as a function of f . The insert shows the ﬁt of this relaxation process for a correlation
function with a negative contribution Nc(f ), typical for systems with memory functions.

For plastic preferences this phenomenology is quite diﬀerent. This situation is shown in Fig. 4. Given that the
individuals search for new preferences in each comparison time, the computational process is very intensive. For this
reason, we performed simulations for short and intermediary time regimes. The must important feature in this results
is that the relaxation process of the correlation function of envious individuals is suppressed and the system reaches
in short comparisons time an equilibrium state. A comparison with the relaxation process of rigid preferences is also
shown in the same plot. Therefore, we can see easily the positive eﬀect of plastic preferences in the over relaxation
process in the number of envious individuals weighted by comparisons time. It is a selective process that discards the
initial non envious state and select the number of individuals that never reach a fairness state.

IV. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK

The previous results are an alternative scenario to improve a system with individuals expressing envy. A very
simple hypothesis considers that the problem of envy control only is related to an allocation mechanism. However,
individuals posses also internal trends which disturb the way they express their own satisfaction level. Two cases has
been considered in the present study: a ﬁrst case where the individuals have rigid preferences and a second where
the individuals can change their preferences if they do not become in a ﬁrst instance what they want. In the worst
of the cases, this adjust process can appears as a resignation of the individual to the circumstances. The eﬀect of an
elastic preference is the introduction of an over-relaxation process in the envy-dynamics of the system. The strong
restriction of the present model is the consideration of a random process in the adjust of preferences.

When elastic preferences are introduced, an uncertainty term is involved given by informational problems, implicit
in social interaction systems, personal experiences and acquisition of new knowledge (i.e., reinforced or cognitive
learning). To reduce its impact at the moment to choose, avoiding distortionary eﬀects in their ultimate objective
(welfare maximization), a cognitive learning mechanism must be introduced, allowing them to make better decisions
in order to reach larger welfare levels regarding to their preferences. To remove the uncertainty component, a model
testing for the ideal way and time to learning must be developed.

Abstract

We analyze three sets of income data: the US Panel Study of Income Dynam-
ics (PSID), the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS), and the German Socio-
Economic Panel (GSOEP). It is shown that the empirical income distribution is con-
sistent with a two-parameter lognormal function for the low-middle income group
(97%–99% of the population), and with a Pareto or power law function for the high
income group (1%–3% of the population). This mixture of two qualitatively diﬀer-
ent analytical distributions seems stable over the years covered by our data sets,
although their parameters signiﬁcantly change in time. It is also found that the
probability density of income growth rates almost has the form of an exponential
function.

1 Introduction

More than a century ago, the economist Vilfredo Pareto stated in his Cours
d’ ´Economie Politique that there is a simple law which governs the distribution
of income in all countries and at all times. Brieﬂy, if N represents all the
number of income-receiving units cumulated from the top above a certain
income limit x, and A and α are constants, then:

N =

A
xα

(1)

−

and, therefore, log (N) = log (A)
αlog (x). In other words, if the logarithms
of the number of persons in receipt of incomes above deﬁnite amounts are
plotted against the logarithms of the amount of these incomes, the points so
obtained will be on a straight line whose slope with the axis on which the
values of log (x) are given will be α. Pareto examined the statistics of incomes
in some countries and concluded that the inclination of the line with the log (x)
axis diﬀered but little from 1.5.

Very recently, considerable investigations with modern data in capitalist
economies have revealed that the upper tail of the income distribution (gen-
erally less than 5% of the individuals) indeed follows the above mentioned
behaviour, and the variation of the slopes both from time to time and from
country to country is large enough not to be negligible. Hence, characteriza-
tion and understanding of income distribution is still an open problem. The
interesting problem that remains to be answered is the functional form more
adequate for the majority of population not belonging to the power law part
of the income distribution. Using data coming from several parts of the world,
a number of recent studies debate whether the low-middle income range of the
income distribution may be ﬁtted by an exponential [1–8] or lognormal [9–13]
decreasing function. 1

In this paper we have analyzed three data sets relating to a pool of ma-
jor industrialized countries for several years in order to add some empirical
investigations to the ongoing debate on income distribution. When ﬁts are
performed, a two-parameter lognormal distribution is used for the low-middle

1 Recently, a distribution proposed by [14,15] has the form of a deformed exponen-
tial function:

which seems to capture well the behaviour of the income distribution at the low-

part of the distribution (97%–99% of the population), while the upper high-
end tail (1%–3% of the population) is found to be consistent with a power law
type distribution. Our results show that the parameters of income distribution
change in time; furthermore, we ﬁnd that the probability density of income
growth rates almost scales as an exponential function.

The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 describes the data used in
our study. Section 3 presents and analyzes the shape of the income distribution
(Section 3.1) and its time development over the years covered by our data sets
(Section 3.2). Section 4 concludes the paper.

2 The Data

We have used income data from the US Panel Study of Income Dynamics
(PSID), the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS), and the German Socio-
Economic Panel (GSOEP) as released in a cross-nationally comparable format
in the Cross-National Equivalent File (CNEF). The CNEF brings together
multiple waves of longitudinal data from the surveys above, and therefore
provides relatively long panels of information. The current release of the CNEF
includes data from 1980 to 2001 for the PSID, from 1991 to 2001 for the BHPS,
and from 1984 to 2002 for the GSOEP. Our data refer to the period 1980–2001
for the United States, and to the period 1991–2001 for the United Kingdom.
As the eastern states of Germany were reunited with the western states of the
Federal Republic of Germany in November 1990, the sample of families in the
East Germany was merged with the existing data only at the beginning of the
1990s. Therefore, in order to perform analyses that represent the population
of reunited Germany, we chose to refer to the subperiod 1990–2002 for the
GSOEP.

A key advantage of the CNEF is that it provides reliable estimates of annual
income variables deﬁned in a similar manner for all the countries that are
not directly available in the original data sets. 2 It includes pre- and post-
government household income, estimates of annual labour income, assets, pri-
vate and public transfers, and taxes paid at household level. In this paper, the
household post-government income variable (equal to the sum of total family
income from labour earnings, asset ﬂows, private transfers, private pensions,
public transfers, and social security pensions minus total household taxes)
serves as the basis for all income calculations. Following a generally accepted
methodology, the concept of equivalent income will serve as a substitute for
personal income, which is unobservable. Equivalent income x is calculated as

follows. In a ﬁrst step, household income h is adjusted for by household type θ
using an equivalence scale e (θ). 3 This adjusted household income x = h/e (θ)
is then attributed to every member of the given household, which implies that
income is distributed equally within households.

In the most recent release, the average sample size varies from about 7,300
households containing approximately 20,200 respondent individuals for the
PSID-CNEF to 6,500 households with approximately 16,000 respondent indi-
viduals for the BHPS-CNEF; for the GSOEP-CNEF data from 1990 to 2002,
we have about 7,800 households containing approximately 20,400 respondent
individuals.

All the variables are in current year currency; therefore, we use the consumer
price indices to convert into constant ﬁgures for all the countries. The base
year is 1995.

3 Empirical Findings

3.1 The Shape of the Distribution

The main panel of the pictures illustrated in Figure 1 presents the empirical
cumulative distribution of the equivalent income from our data sets for some
randomly selected years in the log-log scale. 4 As shown in the lower insets,
the upper income tail (about 1%–3% of the population) follows the Pareto’s
law:

F (x) = P (X

(2)

where Cα = kα, k, α > 0, and k
. Since the values of x above some
x <
value xR can not be observed due to tail truncation, to ﬁt the (logarithm of
the) data for the majority of the population (until the 97th–99th percentiles of
the income distribution) we use a right-truncated normal probability density

each household as equal to 1 + 0.5

4 To treat each wave of the surveys at hand as a cross-section, and to obtain
population-based statistics, all calculations used sample weights which compensate
for unequal probabilities of selection and sample attrition. Furthermore, to elimi-
nate the inﬂuence of outliers, the data were trimmed. We also dropped observations
with zero and negative incomes from all samples.

To select a suitable threshold or cutoﬀ value xR separating the lognormal part
from the Pareto power law tail of the empirical income distribution, we use
visually oriented statistical techniques such as the quantile-quantile (Q-Q) and

mean excess plots. Figure 2 gives an example of these graphical tools for the
countries at hand. The left pictures in the ﬁgure are the plots of the quantile
function for the standard exponential distribution (i.e., a distribution with
a medium-sized tail) against its empirical counterpart. If the sample comes
from the hypothesized distribution, or a linear transformation of it, the Q-Q
plot is linear. The concave presence in the plots is an indication of a fat-tailed
distribution. Since a log-transformed Pareto random variable is exponentially
distributed, we conduct experimental analysis on the log-transformed data by
excluding some of the lower sample points to investigate the concave departure
region on the plots and obtain a ﬁt closer to the straight line. The results
are shown by the insets of the left pictures in the ﬁgure. The right pictures
plot the empirical average of the data that are larger than or equal to xR,
E (X
xR), against xR. If the plot is a linear curve, then it may be either
a power type or an exponential type distribution. If the slope of the linear curve
is greater than zero, then it suggests a power type (as in the main panels);
otherwise, if the slope is equal to zero, it suggests an exponential type (as in
the insets for the log-transformed data).

3.2 Temporal Change of the Distribution

The two-part structure of the empirical income distribution seems to hold all
over the time span covered by our data sets. The distribution for all the years
and countries are shown in Figure 3. As one can easily recognize, the distribu-
tion shifts over the years covered by our data sets. It is conceivable to assume
that the origin of this shift consists in the growth of the countries. To conﬁrm
this assumption, we study the ﬂuctuations in the output and equivalent in-
come growth rate, and try to show that the evolution of both these quantities
is governed by similar mechanisms, pointing in this way to the existence of a
correlation between them as one would expect. We calculate the growth rates
using the monthly series of the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) from [17]
for output and connecting individual respondents’ incomes over time for the
equivalent income, 5 and express them in terms of their logarithm. 6 To ac-
count for the fact that the variance of the growth rates varies, we scale each
growth rate by dividing by the corresponding estimated standard deviation. In
Figure 4 we graph the empirical probability density function for these scaled
growth rates, where the data points for the equivalent income in the main
panels are the average over the entire period covered by the CNEF surveys.
As one can easily recognize, after scaling the resulting empirical probability

5 To properly weight the sample of individuals represented in all the years of the
CNEF surveys, we use the individual’s longitudinal sample weights.
6 All the data have been adjusted to 1995 prices and detrended by the average
growth rate, so values for diﬀerent years are comparable.

density functions appear identical for observations drawn from diﬀerent popu-
lations. Remarkably, both curves display a simple “tent-shaped” form; hence,
the probability density functions are consistent with an exponential decay [18]:

that the two growth rate distributions have the same continuous distribution
by using the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test; the results shown in
Table 1 mean that the test is not signiﬁcant at the 5% level. These ﬁndings are
in quantitative agreement with results reported on the growth of ﬁrms and
countries [19–26], leading us to the conclusion that the data are consistent
with the assumption that a common empirical law might describe the growth
dynamics of both countries and individuals.

Even if the functional form of the income distribution expressed as lognor-
mal with power law tail seems stable, its parameters ﬂuctuate within narrow
bounds over the years for the same country. For example, the power law slope
has a value α = [1.1, 3.34] for the US between 1980 and 2001, while the cur-
vature of the lognormal ﬁt, as measured by the Gibrat index β = 1/
,
ranges between approximately β = 1 and β = 1.65; for the UK between 1991
(cid:17)
and 2001, α = [3.47, 5.76] and β = [2.18, 2.73]; for Germany between 1990 and
2002, α = [2.42, 3.96] and β = [1.63, 2.14]. The time pattern of these param-
eters is shown by the main panels of Figure 5, which also reports in one of
the insets the temporal change of inequality as measured by the Gini coeﬃ-
cient. As one can easily recognize, the information about inequality provided
by the Gibrat index seems near enough to those provided by the Gini coeﬃ-
cient, which is a further conﬁrmation of the fact that the lognormal law is a
good model for the low-middle incomes of the distribution. The Pareto index
is a rather strongly changing index. Among others, the deﬁnition of income
we use in the context of our analysis contains asset ﬂows. It is conceivable to
assume that for the top 1% to 3% of the population returns on capital gains
rather than labour earnings account for the majority share of the total income.

σ√2
(cid:16)

This suggests that the stock market ﬂuctuations might be an important fac-
tor behind the trend of income inequality among the richest, and that capital
income plays an important role in determining the Pareto functional form of
the observed empirical income distribution at the high income range [27]. The
other insets of the pictures also show the time evolution of various parameters
characterizing income distribution, such as the income separating the lognor-
mal and Pareto regimes (selected as explained in Section 3.1), the fraction
of population in the upper tail of the distribution, and the share of total in-
come which this fraction accounts for. 7 One can observe that the fraction of
population and the share of income in the Pareto tail move together in the
opposite direction with respect to the cutoﬀ value separating the body of the
distribution from its tail, and the latter seems to track the temporal evolution
of the Pareto index. This fact means that a decrease (increase) of the power
law slope and the accompanying decrease (increase) of the threshold value xR
imply a greater (smaller) fraction of the population in the tail and a greater
(smaller) share of the total income which this population account for, as well
as a greater (smaller) level of inequality among high income population.

4 Summary and Conclusions

Our analysis of the data for the US, the UK, and Germany shows that there
are two regimes in the income distribution. For the low-middle class up to
approximately 97%–99% of the total population the incomes are well described
by a two-parameter lognormal distribution, while the incomes of the top 1%–
3% are described by a power law (Pareto) distribution.

This structure has been observed in our analysis for diﬀerent years. However,
the distribution shows a rightward shift in time. Therefore, we analyze the
output and individual income growth rate distribution from which we observe
that, after scaling, the resulting empirical probability density functions appear
similar for observations coming from diﬀerent populations. This eﬀect, which
is statistically tested by means of a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test,
raises the intriguing possibility that a common mechanism might characterize
the growth dynamics of both output and individual income, pointing in this
way to the existence of a correlation between these quantities. Furthermore,
from the analysis of the temporal change of the parameters specifying the
distribution, we ﬁnd that these quantities do not necessarily correlate to each
other. This means that diﬀerent mechanisms are working in the distribution of
the low-middle income range and that of the high income range. Since earnings

where µα is the average income of the population in the Pareto tail and µ is the
average income of the whole population.

from ﬁnancial or other assets play an important role in the high income section
of the distribution, one possible origin of this behaviour might be the change
of the asset price, which mainly aﬀects the level of inequality at the very top
of the income distribution and is likely to be responsible for the power law
nature of high incomes.

Fig. 2. Q-Q plots (left pictures) against standard exponential quantiles and mean
excess plots (right pictures) against threshold values for some randomly selected
years. A concave departure from the straight line in the Q-Q plot (as in the left
main panels) or an upward sloping mean excess function (as in the right main
12
panels) indicate a heavy tail in the sample distribution. The insets in the pictures
apply the same graphical tools to the log-transformed data

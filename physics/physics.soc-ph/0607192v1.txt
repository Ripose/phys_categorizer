Abstract

It is well known that there exist statistical and structural diﬀerences between the
stock markets of developed and emerging countries. In this work, we present an
analysis of the variations and autocorrelations of the Mexican Stock Market index
(IPC) for diﬀerent periods of its historical daily data, showing evidence that the
Mexican Stock Market has been increasing its eﬃciency in recent times. We have
analyzed the returns autocorrelation function (ACF) and used detrended ﬂuctuation
analysis (DFA) methods. We also analyze the volatility of the IPC and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and compare their evolution. The data samples
analyzed here, correspond to daily values of the IPC and DJIA for the period
10/30/1978 to 02/28/2006.

1 Introduction

Several empirical studies of worldwide ﬁnancial time series have produced
very interesting and important results under both theoretical and practical
points of view [1,2,3,4,5]. Examples are the determination of the power law
character of the distribution of the variation of assets returns; temporal auto-
correlations of returns decaying to zero in a few minutes following a random
walk process and very long nonlinear correlations for their absolute returns
(long term memory of the volatility of returns). These statistical properties
are part of the so-called “stylized facts” of ﬁnancial markets [6,7]. Also, many
studies have been carried to test the Eﬃcient Market Hypothesis [8]. It estab-
lishes that at any given time, the prices of traded assets fully and instantly
reﬂect all available information reaching the market, and the market is said
to be eﬃcient. Nowadays it is clear that a completly eﬃcient market is only
an idealization and that diﬀerent markets have diﬀerent degrees of eﬃciency.
However, more recent empirical studies seem to show that ﬁnancial markets
are evolving and increasing their eﬃciency over time [9,10].

It is well known that emerging stock markets display diﬀerent structural and
statistical properties 1 with regard to those belonging to developed countries.
Among them, we can mention the following structural diﬀerences: higher sen-
sitivity to capital ﬂows, slower reaction to new information and a bigger ef-
fect of nonsynchronous trading on the prices. Among the statistical diﬀer-
ences we have: emerging markets are more volatile, with higher average re-
turns, slower autocorrelation function decrements and bigger Hurst exponents
[11,12,13,14,15,16]. All of the above can be described in economic terms saying
that emerging markets are “less eﬃcient” than well established stock markets.
In this work we use the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) index as a
benchmark, and study the autocorrelations and other statistical properties of
the Mexican stock market, which can be considered as a relatively new 2 and
emerging stock market. Using the above techniques we are able to show that
there is good evidence that the Mexican stock market has been increasing its
eﬃciency in recent years.

This paper is organized as follows: In section 2, an analysis of the ACF for
diﬀerent time periods of the IPC is presented and compared with those of the
DJIA, showing that the Mexican index ACF time decay is becoming shorter
and the amplitude of the ACF ﬂuctuations smaller. In section 3, we applied
the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) statistical method to the IPC and
DJIA returns series. A comparative analysis gives a signal suggesting matura-
tion and more eﬃcient behavior of the IPC. In section 4, a volatility analysis

shows how the volatility of IPC has decreased steadily in time and particu-
larly in the last 3 years has become comparable to that of the DJIA. Also in
this section a trend analysis of both IPC and DJIA mean value and standard
deviation is performed, showing that IPC variations evolve to tie those of the
DJIA. Finally a summary of all results and conclusions derived from this work
is presented in the last section of this paper.

2 Autocorrelation Function of the IPC variations for diﬀerent time

periods

In this study, we analyze the IPC and DJIA returns deﬁned as: S(t) = ln P (t+
∆t)−ln P (t), where P (t) is the value of the index at time t and ∆t = 1 trading
day. Since we lack high frequency data for the IPC, we have used daily values
in our analysis. Despite this fact, we show that there is clear evidence of the
evolution towards maturity and increment of eﬃciency of the IPC index, as is
shown below.

The IPC data sample covers the period from 10/30/1978 to 02/28/2006 and
was divided in 5 subperiods of about 6 years each: 1978-1983, 1984-1989, 1990-
1995, 1996-2001 and 2002-2006. We calculated the returns ACF for each one
of these subperiods and show them in the ﬁgure 1a). In ﬁgure 1b) we can see
the same data with a time-log scale. There is a clear tendency for the ACF
to decrease faster over time. In ﬁgure 2a), we compare the IPC returns ACF
for the period 1984-1989 with the DJIA returns ACF for the same period.
We can observe that the amplitude of the ﬂuctuations of the IPC decays to a
noise level more slowly when compared to the DJIA. Moreover, some kind of
periodical amplitude ﬂuctuations can be seen, with a period of about 8 days
decaying to zero after about 25 days. This behavior is not to be expected in
an eﬃcient market. Next we do the same comparison for data belonging to the
most recent time period, i.e., for the period 2002-2006. This is shown in the
lower panel of ﬁgure 2, where we can see that IPC and DJIA’s ACFs simul-
taneously reach the noise level. Also, the ﬂuctuations are very similar in both
cases. Information shown in ﬁgures 1 and 2 suggests that, from the point of
view of the ACF, the Mexican stock market is becoming similar to the DJIA,
that is, it is becoming more eﬃcient.

3 Detrended Fluctuation Analysis of the IPC

Signal analysis using detrended ﬂuctuation analysis was introduced by Peng
and collaborators [17]. It has proved to be a valuable tool when searching for
long time correlations in non-stationary time series. In this method, a scaling

• ii) if 0.5 < α < 1, persistent long-range power-law correlations are present

in the time series, and;

• iii) if 0 < α < 0.5, power-law anti-correlations are present.

In the upper panel of ﬁgure 3, we show the Hurst exponent α computed for a
time window of 3 years as a function of time, for both the IPC and the DJIA.
It can be seen how the values of α in the initial years of the IPC (1980-1990),
are much more erratic than those for DJIA. Great departures larger than a
value of α = 0.5 is a characteristic of an emerging or non-mature ﬁnancial
market [16]. In contrast, the DJIA, which can be considered a mature market
since decades ago, shows much less pronounced variations in α for the same
period with a value smaller than (but very) close to 0.5.

The six year averaged values for α shown in ﬁgure 3a) show how this exponent
has been moving towards a value of 0.5 for the IPC, in particular it has a value
of α = 0.51 for the period 1996-2002, and α = 0.501 for 2002-present. Figure
3b) shows a close-up of the period 1999-present, where it is clear how the two
indexes behave in a similar fashion, both ﬂuctuating around α = 0.5. Despite
the relative small sizes of data samples analized [18], we believe the DFA
analysis summarized in this ﬁgure stands as good evidence of the maturation
of the IPC in recent times.

4 Volatility Analysis

Volatility is a term used for a statistical measure of value mean ﬂuctuations
over a certain interval of time of a given security or market index. A volatility
measure still used in ﬁnance is the standard deviation of the security varia-
tions. However, because it is now well known that those changes do not follow a
Gaussian distribution, other measures to describe these changes are preferred.
In this section, volatility is calculated [19] by taking the absolute returns and
averaging them over a time window T = n∆t, i.e.

V (t) :=

1
nΣt+n−1

t′=t

|S(t′)|.

(1)

In our case we used a T = 3 years time window in order to compare IPC and
DJIA volatilities and ∆t = 1 day. Both of them are displayed in ﬁgure 4.

The market’s volatility can be used as an indicator for signs of maturation.
Persistent large values in the volatility are indicative of a market’s immaturity.
It is clear from ﬁgure 4a) that the IPC’s volatility was consistently higher than
that of the DJIA, except for more recent years (see Figure 4b), where the two
indexes show fairly similar values of volatility. Again we believe this is a sign of
the evolution of the Mexican Stock Market towards a more eﬃcient behavior.

4.1 Mean value and Standard Deviation analysis

Finally, for completeness we have calculated and compared the 50 day Simple
Moving Average (SMA) of the mean and standard deviation (RMS) of the
IPC and DJIA returns for the total period 10/30/1978 to 02/28/2006. They
are shown in ﬁgures 5a) and 5b).

Fig. 5. IPC and DJIA daily returns Mean (upper panel) and RMS (lower panel)
evolution for the 10/30/1978 to 02/28/2006 period.

It is interesting to observe that the IPC returns ﬂuctuations appear to become
smaller in both mean value and RMS, i.e. seems that IPC is becoming more
well centered around zero and the amplitud of their ﬂuctuations lessened.
Trying to gain some insight and conﬁrm this behavior, we have calculated
the returns mean value and RMS independently for each one of the periods
already analyzed in previous sections. These values are shown in tables 1 and
2.

From table 1 is not easy to appreciate a clear trend of how the IPC and
DJIA mean values of returns ﬂuctuations are evolving over time; however,
with respect to the standard deviation and observing the second column of
table 2, we can say that a clear decreasing trend in the IPC RMS exists, and
therefore it is possible to say that the IPC is becoming less volatile, with
a strong tendency to tie DJIA variations as can be appreciated from fourth
column of the same table. This fact conﬁrms again the evolution of the IPC
to maturity.

5 Resume

We have used four distinct methods, namely: autocorrelation analysis, de-
trended ﬂuctuation analysis, volatility analysis and standard deviation trend-
ing analysis, to study the maturation process of the Mexican stock market
through its leading index, the IPC, and compared the results with a well de-
veloped and mature index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). In all
four cases, we have found compelling evidence of evolution of the Mexican
market towards a more eﬃcient market. In particular, from around year 2000
to date, the four methods used in this study show that the IPC has remarkably
similar behavior to that of the DJIA.

Endo- vs. Exo-genous shocks and relaxation

rates in book and music ”sales”

Abstract

In this paper, we analyze the response of music and book sales to an external ﬁeld

and to buyer herding. We distinguish endogenous and exogenous shocks. We focus

on some case studies, whose data have been collected from ranking on amazon.com.

We show that an ensemble of equivalent systems quantitatively respond in a simi-

lar way to a similar ”external shock”, indicating roads to universality features. In

contrast to Sornette et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 93, 228701 (2004)] who seemed to ﬁnd

power law behaviors, in particular at long times, - a law interpreted in terms of an

epidemic activity, we observe that the relaxation process can be as well seen as an

exponential one that saturates toward an asymptotic state, itself diﬀerent from the

pre-shock state. By studying an ensemble of 111 shocks, on books or records, we

show that exogenous and endogenous shocks are discriminated by their short−time

behaviour: the relaxation time seems to be twice shorter in endogenous shocks than

in exogenous ones. We interpret the ﬁnding through a simple thermodynamic model

with a dissipative force.

1 Introduction

The ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem is a corner stone of Statistical Mechan-

ics (1; 2). Indeed, it allows to relate quantitatively two classes of dynami-

cal features of macroscopic systems, namely ﬂuctuation phenomena which are

stochastic deviations from some equilibrium state, and the dissipative response

of the system to an external ﬁeld. In out-of-equilibrium situations, however,

such relations are not usually applicable a priori, even though they may be

generalized in some particular cases (3; 4). A revival of studies has been re-

cently seen on this theorem, associated to features of shocks in sociological and

economical networks (5). Indeed, these systems are not usually considered to

be mechanistic in essence, whence driven by deterministic Hamiltonian-like

equations. They are not at equilibrium in the classical sense, and are usu-

ally subjects to outliers, like bubbles and crashes, in ﬁnancial markets (6),

the emergence of trends in sales and weblogs (7), or epidemia and avalanches

in opinion formation (8) and science. Generally, these critical events may be

caused by two kinds of mechanisms. On the one hand, there is the response

to some external ﬁeld. In this case, one speaks of an exogenous shock. On

the other hand, there is the spontaneous evolution of the system through a

hierarchy of avalanches of all sizes. These extreme events are considered to be

endogenous, as it has been formalized by the theory of Self-Organized Criti-

cality (SOC) (9). In most non-physical systems, it is not easy to distinguish

these two kinds of features since systems are usually driven by an interplay of

the two mechanisms.

In the instance hereby considered, i.e. the case of marketing, the sales of a

product are usually driven by a reputation cascade as well as advertisements

for the product. For example, in book sales dynamics, some books reach their

peak abruptly, followed by decreasing sales, while others reach their top rank-

ings after a longer time on the market, followed by gradually falling sales. Sor-

nette et al. (10) introduced an epidemic-like model containing a long memory

process for the buyers, characterized by an exponent θ ∈ [0, 1

2]. Endogenous

shocks were shown to be formed by a slow increase of the sales, followed by

a symmetric relaxation, i.e. the formation and the relaxation process behave

like |tc + t|2θ−1, where t = 0 corresponds to the peak maximum and tc is

an additional (not interpreted) positive parameter. In contrast, an exogenous

shock occurs abruptly and the sales decay faster, like (tc + t)θ−1. This predic-

tion agrees with the intuition that an endogenous shock ﬁnds its origin in the

structure of the buyers network and should have a longer life time than a shock

which has been imposed by an external cause to the system. By measuring

relaxations of a large number of endogenous and exogenous shocks, Sornette et

al. found an average value of the exponent θ ∼ 0.3 ± 0.1. However, the values

of tc, i.e. the short-time behaviour of the relaxation, are not considered.

Nevertheless, despite these pioneering results, many fundamental questions

remain open in order to fulﬁll the original purpose of these studies, namely

a generalization of linear-response theory to marketing and sociological sys-

tems. In this respect let us point to Groot (11) studies of sales data in a

commodity market from the point of view of the ﬂuctuation spectrum and

noise correlations.

After some caveat on the methodology inherent to such a type of studies and a

visual discrimination between an ”endogenous” and an ”exogenous” shock on

3

a case study, in Sect. 2, the present paper focuses on two important issues. On

the one hand, we verify a required condition for the applicability of a macro-

scopic description, namely we check the reproducibility of the ”experiment”,

both in music sales and on book sales in Sect. 3. This is done through two case

studies. Thereby, we study the relaxation of equivalent systems to an external

shock. On the other hand, we revisit the study of Sornette et al. and focus on

the short time scale after a sales maximum (∼ 1 month). On this time scale,

most of the systems rather show an exponential relaxation that was hidden by

the parameter tc, and not a power law decay. Moreover, we question whether

the observed long time power-law relaxations are not in fact associated to a

saturation eﬀect, in Sect. 4. Finally in Sect. 5, we study the relaxations of

a ”large ensemble” of shocks, characterized by their relaxation time tR, and

highlight a quantitative diﬀerence between exogenous and endogenous shocks,

whence in the short time range. The values of the relaxation rates allow to dis-

criminate rapidly between endo- and exo-genous shocks. A theoretical model

based on simple thermodynamics taking into account a dissipative force has

two easily measurable parameters given by the initial and asymptotic ranking

states. The relaxation time has a much more precise meaning than tc.

2 Methodology

Amazon (www.amazon.cm) is the largest online store selling many goods, such

as electronic devices, books, or music albums. Among its descriptions of the

product, the website assigns a rank which takes into account the number of

copies that have been sold in the past. The reverse translation of this rank into

the number of sold copies is not an easy task. However, as discussed in ref.,

4

one may approximate this relation by the power law S ∼ R−1/2, where S is the

number of sold items, and R is its rank in the Amazon database. Some warning

is needed at once. The method for providing a rank to an item is oﬃcially the

following. For the top 10 000 best sellers from amazon.com sales., the rank

is updated each hour and takes into account the sales of the preceding 24

hours. The next 90 000 ranks are updated daily, while the rest of the items is

updated monthly with several diﬀerent rules. In order to avoid such changes in

the rank assignment method, and therefore artiﬁcial consequences on the time

evolution of R, we restrict our analysis to items that remain in the [1 : 100000]

interval.

In order to get the time evolution of R over a long time range, we have used

data collected by junglescan (www.junglescan.com). This website allows the

users to enter a product’s URL, and scans its rank R from the amazon website

in the course of time. The time evolution of the rank is then stored and

accessible. One should note, however, that the scanning rate is not a constant.

This is illustrated in ﬁgure 1, for a typical case where we plot the total number

of scans for some music album, the XO of Elliott Smith, as a function of time.

It is shown not only that the average scanning rate has evolved in the course

of time, 1/day, 3/day, 8/day, but also that drastic local time interval changes

may occur, as illustrated in the inset. Moreover, due to unrelated to our study

technical problems in the junglescan server, most of the scans that we have

elaborated have been stopped at the beginning of November 2004.

Let us now focus on a case study, namely Angels and Demons by Dan Brown.

It has been ﬁrst published on July 2001 and has been scanned from Oct. 1,

2002 till Nov. 4, 2004. In ﬁgure 2, one observes that, before March 2003, Angels

and Demons was not under the spotlight and that its rank remained near the

with the publication and fame of The Da Vinci Code, which makes the former

book jumps in the top 100 after a few days. This example shows the strong

correlations between two book sales, namely The Da Vinci Code and Angels

and Demons, abrupt changes in the book sales associated to what can be

considered an exogenous shock, around April 10th 2003, and an endogenous

shock in September 2003.

A ﬁrst requirement in order to apply a ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem to sales

is the existence of a well-deﬁned macroscopic friction process in the system. It

September 2003, there has been a slowly evolving bubble in book sales, - associated

to an endogenous shock

implies that an ensemble of equivalent systems should evolve according to that

macroscopic law when they are put outside the stationary state. Of course,

it is not easy to produce such a controlled experiment in the case of sales.

Nevertheless, we should verify this preliminary property through a detailed

analysis of statistically appropriate cases.

3.1 Music sales

In order to do so, we consider the sales of 3 albums of Elliott Smith: Figure

8(2000), XO(1998) and Either/Or(1998) (Fig. 3). On Oct. 22, 2003, this young

folk music writer died from an apparent suicide. The next day, in response to

this unexpected focus around his personality, all of his albums underwent an

abrupt jump of their sales that relaxed over a few weeks. This is a perfect

example of exogenous shock, whose accidental source moreover allows to get

rid of any marketing strategy. One should also note, as illustrated in ﬁgure

3, that the event produced a very localized stream in the media, on the day

of his death and the next one. This allows to aﬃrm that the slow relaxation

process of the sales obviously ﬁnds its origin in the sales dynamics itself.

Let us stress that this (external) shock makes the system reach a stationary

state diﬀerent from the pre-shock state. In the case of Either/Or, for instance,

the pre-shock state ﬂuctuates around rank 1800. The shock makes the rank

jump to 17, followed by a relaxation of some weeks to an asymptotic state

around rank 500. This behaviour is similar to most other cases that we have

studied, namely an exponential relaxation for short times that saturates to an

asymptotic value, i.e. the post-shock state. We discuss this issue further in the

remainder of this section.

The three album signals obviously diﬀer from each other (Fig. 3). This is well

seen in the pre-shock regime where each album average rank ranges between

1 800 and 8 000. A rescaling would account for emphasizing the qualitative

diﬀerences between the albums. Assuming a constant in time scaling factor,

the average pre-shock values become almost equal, in so doing indicating uni-

versality features. Therefore, we observe that the three data collapse on each

other, and that the short time rank relaxation behaves like eλt, with a re-

laxation coeﬃcient λ = 0.18. This means that the three equivalent systems

respond in the same way to the studied external shock.

Fig. 4. Time evolution of the ranks of Get with the program by B. Greene

Another way to verify the reproducibility of an experiment is to consider

the response of one system to several ”equivalent” shocks. To do so, we have

considered the rank of Get with program, written by B. Greene, and focused of

the jumps due to his frequent passages at the Oprah Winfrey Show, between

Jan. 02 and Jul. 03 (see Fig. 4). The rank relaxations of the ﬁrst 4 shocks are

plotted in ﬁgure 5, under (a) log-normal and (b) log-log scale. Data analysis

leads to the same conclusion as in the previous (music sales) example, namely

an initial exponential relaxation followed by saturation, and conﬁrms that

book and music sales are similar macroscopic phenomena, with respect to

shocks.

also plot the short time and long time asymptotic behaviours of these functions for

comparison, namely R = 6 e0.06t and R ∼ t2.1.

12

4 Short time and long time behaviours

The above results suggests to question the universality of the power law, and

to emphasize the short time scale behavior relaxation, i.e. to draw a par-

allel between the relaxation coeﬃcient λ and a dissipative force. Moreover

since Sornette et al. (10) found relaxation processes of book sales governed by

power-laws (tc + t)µ, it is of interest to compare this power-law behaviour to

the exponential one found in the previous section. Notice that these authors

focused their analysis on the long time behaviour. However, there was no de-

tailed analysis of the short-time scale of the relaxation in their work, nor a

clear explanation of the parameter tc. The case studies in the previous section

suggest that the short-time relaxation processes are rather exponential. In the

following, we present a simple alternative description of the relaxation that ac-

counts for the short-time dissipation, as well as for the asymptotic saturation

leading to the asymptotic state.

First, let us assume that the sales can be related to the rank through the

relation S = R−γ, γ = 1

2. Let us stress that the exact value of this exponent is

not critical, and that this value was chosen only in order to allow comparisons

with the results of Sornette et al. Then, we assume that the response of the

sales to a shock is an exponential decrease toward an asymptotic state diﬀerent

of zero. The non-vanishing asymptotic state is, in the thermodynamic sense,

due to the continuous agitation of the buyers, agitation that encompasses

internal dynamics due to buyers interactions and small external kicks. The

simplest form is

S = S∞ + (S0 − S∞)e− λ
2 t

(1)

13

that leads to the following expression for the item rank.

R = (R

∞ + (R

0 − R

− 1
∞ )e− λ
2

2 t)−2

(2)

This expression reduces to R ∼ R0 eλt in the small time limit. Therefore, this

description has the advantage to depend directly on observable quantities,

namely the friction coeﬃcient λ, and both initial and asymptotic values of the

ranks.

In ﬁgures 5 and 6, we apply this ﬁtting procedure to an exogenous (Get with

the program) and an endogenous (Heaven and Earth, by N. Roberts) shock.

Moreover, we compare the results with the power-law ﬁts (tc+t)µ of Sornette et

al. In the ﬁrst case (Fig.5), the ﬁtted parameters of (2) are R∞ = 1200, R0 = 6

and λ = 0.16, and the power law ﬁt is 0.07 (6 + t)2.2. In the other case (Fig. 6),

the parameters of (2) are R∞ = 3000, R0 = 40 and λ = 0.06, and the power

law 0.045 (25 +t)2.1. In these ﬁgures, we also plot the short time and long time

asymptotic behaviours of these functions for comparison. One observes that

both approaches lead to similar results that can not be discriminated given

the data accuracy. This is veriﬁed by focusing on the mean square deviation:

σF =

s P

K
i=1(log(Ri) − log(Ri
K

F ))2

(3)

where K is the number of data points, Ri the rank from the data set and

Ri

F the value of the ﬁtted function, either exponential (F = E) or power law

(F = P ). In the case of Heaven and Earth, for instance, these values for the

exponential and the power law ﬁt are very close, σE = 0.249 and σP = 0.278.

This equivalence is remarkable, given the long time intervals considered hereby

(100 and 200 days). However, one should note the very high value of tc = 25

Relaxation coefficient
Fig. 7. Cumulated probability of the relaxation coeﬃcient λ, in the case of ex-

(endogenous) and 0.14 (exogenous), that correspond to the characteristic relaxation

times tR ∼ 13 and tR ∼ 7 days respectively

in ﬁgure 6, that dominates the power-law decrease over a long time scale, and

thereby might mask the extension of the exponential relaxation at long times

in Sornette et al. approach. It is also fair to recognize the large but similar

values of the exponent µ.

A comparison of the friction coeﬃcient λ in Figs. 5 and 6 suggests that ex-

ogenous and endogenous shocks occur on diﬀerent time scales tR ≡ λ−1. One

should stress here that this assertion is diﬀerent from that Sornette et al., i.e.

a discrimination of shocks can be based on the short-time behaviour of the

relaxation process, and not on its tail.

15

5 Universality behaviours

In order to highlight this observation, we have focused on 111 (56 endo- and 55

exo-genous) shocks extracted from the junglescan data, indiscriminating be-

tween books and records. The shocks were found by coarse-graining the signal

over one week, and by neglecting relaxations with λ < 0.01, such that shocks

are distinguished from quick and large ﬂuctuations. Moreover, we have only

considered shocks occurring at least 1 month after the begin of the scans, i.e.

in order to reject new products and dumping acts, and whose minimum rank

veriﬁed R0 < 100. Finally, exogenous and endogenous shocks were visually

discriminated by focusing on the pre-shock acceleration.

In order to measure λ, we have looked for the best ﬁtting exponential in an

interval of 15 days after the shock. The resulting cumulated histograms for λ

are plotted in ﬁgure 7. The histograms for the exogenous and the endogenous

shocks are markedly diﬀerent. The peak and the average probability distri-

bution of λ of the endogenous shocks are well separated from those of the

exogeneous ones : < λ >exo∼ 2 < λ >endo= 0.14. This obviously conﬁrms that

the initial decay of exogenous and endogenous shocks occurs on diﬀerent time

ranges.

6 Conclusion

We have examined endogenous and exogenous so called shocks in music and

book sales, measured from their rank in amazon.com. We have focused on some

case studies. We have shown that music and book sales quantitatively respond

in a similar way to a similar ”external shock”. In contrast to Sornette et al.

16

(10) who found power law behaviors, and interpreted the ﬁnding in terms

of an epidemic activity, we have observed that the relaxation can be seen

as an exponential that saturates toward an asymptotic state, itself diﬀerent

from the pre-shock state. We have emphasized the non universal value of

tc and found power law exponents quite diﬀerent from Sornette et al., both

larger but very similar for the two types of shocks. We prefer to interpret our

ﬁndings through a simple macroscopic model with agitated herding buyers and

a dissipative force. By studying an ensemble of 111 shocks, on books or records,

we have shown that exogenous and endogenous shocks are discriminated by

their short − time behaviour: the relaxation time tR seems to be twice shorter

in exogenous shocks than in endogenous ones. This is a relevant (scientiﬁc

and economic) result that completes the discrimination procedure of Sornette

et al. and should be veriﬁed in other ﬁelds related to trend emergence, such

as opinion formation, ﬁnancial bubbles or scientiﬁc avalanches, on various

networks indicating roads to universality classes.

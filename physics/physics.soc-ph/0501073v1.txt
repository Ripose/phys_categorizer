Abstract

The Heider balance (HB) is investigated in a fully connected graph
of N nodes. The links are described by a real symmetric array r(i, j),
i, j = 1, ..., N . In a social group, nodes represent group members and links
represent relations between them, positive (friendly) or negative (hostile).
At the balanced state, r(i, j)r(j, k)r(k, i) > 0 for all the triads (i, j, k). As
follows from the structure theorem of Cartwright and Harary, at this state
the group is divided into two subgroups, with friendly internal relations
and hostile relations between the subgroups. Here the system dynamics is
proposed to be determined by a set of diﬀerential equations, ˙r = r · r. The
form of equations guarantees that once HB is reached, it persists. Also,
for N = 3 the dynamics reproduces properly the tendency of the system to
the balanced state. The equations are solved numerically. Initially, r(i, j)
are random numbers distributed around zero with a symmetric uniform
distribution of unit width. Calculations up to N = 500 show that HB
is always reached. Time τ (N ) to get the balanced state varies with the
system size N as N −1/2
. The spectrum of relations, initially narrow, gets
very wide near HB. This means that the relations are strongly polarized.
In our calculations, the relations are limited to a given range around zero.
With this limitation, our results can be helpful in an interpretation of
some statistical data.

Introduction

The purpose of this work is to develop a mathematical formulation of the time
evolution of social relations. Theory of this problem was initialized in 40’s by
Fritz Heider [1, 2, 3]. As we will see below, some ingredients of the Heider
approach are present in the Sznajd model of convincing people, designed in
2000 [4, 5].

The Heider balance (HB) is a concept in social psychology [6]. For the
purposes of this text, HB can be summarized as follows. A set of N nodes,
which represent a group of its human members, form a fully connected graph,
i.e. each pair of nodes is linked. Each link is represented by an element ri,j of
a symmetric matrix; it takes a value ±1. (Our discussion here does not include
the possibility when ri,j = 0, what is more complex.) This element is a measure
of the relation between i and j; it is positive if they are friends, negative in
the opposite. In the HB state, the product ri,j rj,krk,i is positive for each triad

1

(i, j, k) of nodes. This means that either all r′s in the triad are positive or
exactly two of them are negative.

This kind of balance or equilibrium of a social system has been designed to
reproduce the human tendency to preserve a cognitive consistency of hostility
’my friend’s friend is my friend, my
and friendship. The principle is simple:
friend’s enemy is my enemy, my enemy’s friend is my enemy, my enemy’s enemy
is my friend’ [2]. Once the balance is not present, there is a kind of tension
in the group members’ minds which can eventually lead to changes in their
opinions. Once the balance is present, it appears to be stable, because there is
no cognitive dissonance which could change the state. More information and
references can be found in [7].

It appears that HB is equivalent to a partition of the graph into two separate
subgraphs. Within each of them, all links are positive (i.e. ri,j > 0 if both nodes
i and j belong to the same subgraphs). On the contrary, links between nodes
belonging to diﬀerent subgraphs are negative. This statement is the content
of the so-called structure theorem ([8, 9]). In social language, HB means that
there are two antagonistic groups, with perfect accordance within them and
pure hostility between them. The eﬀect has been termed ’social mitosis’ [10].
As a special case, HB includes also states where all links are positive and there
is only one subgraph, identical with the whole graph. In recent computational
experiment, several graphs were analyzed with diﬀerent initial distribution of the
signs of links. There, HB was identiﬁed as a ﬁnal state in all investigated cases
[10]. The dynamics included changes of sign of links contained by unbalanced
triads. As far as we know, there is no proof that this dynamics always leads
to HB [10]. It is clear that HB is stable with respect to this kind of evolution:
once HB is reached, the system remains unchanged.

Our aim here is to use real numbers instead of ±1 to describe the opinion
distribution and its dynamics. There are heavy arguments to introduce this
modiﬁcation. First, as noted in Ref. [10], the relations between human beings
vary in strength and not only in sign. Moreover, techniques of measurements
of this strength are well established in sociology [6]. In particular, the famous
Bogardus scale of social distance [11] seems to be appropriate for our purposes.
(For its recent application see e.g. Ref.[12].) The only modiﬁcation needed is to
convert it by decreasing function f (x) as to get a positive number (say, R) for
shortest social distance (f (1) = R), and a negative number (say, −R) for the
largest social distance smax (f (smax) = −R or so). Second, dynamics expressed
in terms of diﬀerential equations allows to capture diﬀerent timescales of the
[7], three of them are
processes, which are present in social groups. In Ref.
named: reciprocity, transitivity and balance. Although here we deal with the
balance only (which is supposed to be the slowest), the modiﬁcation is promising
for future generalizations of the model. Still, the velocity of time evolution of a
particular link can depend on the state of the network and in general it varies
in time. Third, the question ’which link changes as ﬁrst?’ ubiquitous in discrete
simulations, is evaded; in the continuous formulation all links are allowed to
evolve simultaneously.

2 Equations

In the original discrete picture, opinion of i on j is inﬂuenced by k as follows.
An example of imbalanced triad is, when there are two positive links and one
negative. This can mean that, example giving, i likes both j and k (two positive
links) but k dislikes j. For i, there is a cognitive dissonance. It can be removed
by rejecting either i or j. In both cases, the division for good and bad people
((ij) vs (k) or (ik) vs (j)) becomes consistent.

Instead, we propose a set of diﬀerential equations

dr(i, j)
dt

=

r(i, k)r(k, j)

For a triad (x, y, z) of three nodes this set is equivalent to three nonlinear

The set of ﬁxed points consists three coordinate axes: (x = y = 0) plus
(y = z = 0) plus (z = x = 0). We ask if these ﬁxed points are stable. Consider,
for example, the OX axis where (y = z = 0). The Jacobian at the ﬁxed point is

with the eigenvalues (0,+x,-x). We know that the stability condition demands
all eigenvalues to be negative [13]. It is clear that the ﬁxed points are not stable.
The condition of HB reduces to xyz > 0, what is fulﬁlled in four out of eight
parts of space of coordinates (x, y, z). This condition, once true, remains true
forever: either there are no negative bonds and all time derivatives are positive,
or two bonds are negative and their time derivatives are negative as well.

For larger N the method of inspection ceases to be simple, and therefore
we rely on numerical simulations. However, we can add a simple observation
which is valid for any value of N . Multiplying Eq. (1) by r(i, j), we get on
r.h.s. a sum on expressions r(i, k)r(k, j)r(j, i), each of them is positive at HB.
On l.h.s, we get ˙r2(i, j)/2. This means that r(i, j) ˙r(i, j) > 0 at HB. Then at
HB either r(i, j) > 0 and ˙r(i, j) > 0, or r(i, j) < 0 and ˙r(i, j) < 0: positive
links increase, negative links decrease. This property, once true, cannot change;
therefore HB is stable. We note that both sides of Eq.(1) can be positive before
HB is reached. We have seen a numerical example of such a state.

Basic result of this work is to demonstrate numerically that the dynamics
given by Eq.1 leads to HB in all investigated cases. This result and the method
is analogous to those of Ref. [10]: we start from a random initial state and we
average the obtained results over a reasonable number of graphs of the same
size N . What is calculated is the time to get HB, as dependent on the number

N of nodes. We apply the Runge-Kutta method of 4-th order, with adjusting
the length of timesteps.

We are also interested on the time evolution of the probability distribution
of links ri,j. However, near HB the matrix elements increase without limits.
We believe that this is not so in the psychosociological reality, where extreme
opinions do not spread just because we prefer to be considered as civilized
people. In other words, the Bogardus scale remains ﬁnite at both ends. It is
reasonable to introduce this limitation into the equations. We use an envelope

We guess that the dynamics of getting HB is not inﬂuenced if R is large

enough.

3 Results

In Fig. 1 we show the time T (N ) of getting HB as dependent on the system
size N . The log-log plot reveals that above N = 100, the slope of the curve is
consistent with the law T ∝ N −1/2. These results are obtained both for R = 5.0
and inﬁnity; in the latter case, G(r; R) = 1. We deduce that the limitation of
R = 5.0 does not inﬂuence the dynamics until HB is reached.

On the contrary, it is more convenient to evaluate the statistics of r(i, j)
when its size is limited. Also, as remarked in the preceding section, a limitation

of r(i, j) is justiﬁed from the basic point of view. Then we calculate the time
dependence of the distribution of r(i, j) for the case when R = 5.0. The results
are shown in Fig.2. The distribution of the matrix elements r(i, j) at diﬀerent
stages of the process is shown in Figs.3-7.

The above value −1/2 of the exponent is easy to be explained as a superpo-
sition of two factors. As it follows from Eq.1, the velocity of the variation of the
matrix elements r(i, j) is a summation over ’third’ nodes of the triads. As such,
it increases linearly with N . On the other hand, r.h.s of Eq. (1) is composed
from random numbers with initial average equal zero. The deviation from the
average is known to decrease with N as N −1/2. The velocity as a product in-
creases as N 1/2, and the time T (N ) is its inverse. This argument on the time T
as an inverse of the velocity holds when the distribution of the matrix elements
is symmetric around zero. For asymmetric distributions the obtained time T is
shorter. The system goes to HB even if all initial r’s are negative. In this case
the distribution is continuously shifted in time towards positive values.

4 Discussion

In fully connected networks, at most two subgraphs can appear at the Heider
balance. We note that this is a consequence of the assumption that a triad
with all links negative remains unbalanced [8, 9]. However, it is easy to imagine
that instead of a fully connected graph we have a shell structure where there
is a number of subgraphs connected in a chain one to another with negative
links. In this case, each subgraph can reach HB separately. In social reality,
we can rarely state that a given social system is balanced; the polarization of
opinions seems to be much better to investigate and predict conﬂicts. The most
important goal of this work is a conclusion, is that the removing of a cognitive

dissonance is accompanied with the polarization of opinions. This result cannot
be obtained if opinions are represented merely by ±1.

This polarization is due both to the positive interaction within the subgraph
(’my friend’s friend is my friend’) and the negative interaction between the
subgraphs (’ my enemy’s enemy is my friend’). Once HB is reached, each opinion
- negative and positive - is enhanced by the interaction with other people. In
the sociological literature, the eﬀect is known as ’echo hypothesis’ [14]. Eq. (1)
can be treated as its mathematical formulation. This positive feedback between
neighboring links is to some extent reﬂected also in the Sznajd model [4], where
a consent of opinions of two people inﬂuences their neighbours.

In our approach, the dynamics is local: evolution of each bond r(i, j) is de-
termined solely by the state of triads which contain the nodes i and j. This
is close to existing social systems, where people do not count the balanced tri-
ads in the whole network. On the other hand, in reality people change their
opinions on other people classifying them in categories, along social, political
or ethnic criteria. These cathegories are known to play major role in conﬂict
emerging. This is a diﬀerence between this approach and other models of opin-
ion dynamics, as the Sznajd model [4], where opinions on some general ideas are
considered. However, these general ideas could deal as well with the above men-
tioned classifying criteria. For example, the idea of racism inﬂuences relations
between people of diﬀerent races, etc.

The goal of this work is to improve the agreement between the Heider model
of removing the cognitive dissonance and the mathematical realization of this
model. Such aim is less ambitious than a proof that the model is true by
comparing the its results with reality, what is always a formidable task in social
sciences [15]. However, for an illustration of the idea we have found an example

7

in recent history of Poland, where the public opinion was strongly coupled to
relations between actors at the political scene. For some time, curricula of public
people are investigated by law to check if they collaborated with the communist
secret service before 1989. Analysis of opinions on this law displayed no great
interest in May 1999 [16]. However, in June 1999 the law was applied to our
former Prime Minister. Then people started to wonder what their political
friends know about them, who is reliable etc. Although the discussion on the
law remained general and abstract, interpersonal relations were inﬂuenced by
fear. The resulting polarization of opinions is shown in Fig. 4. We note that
in other cases, as the war in Iraq [17] or the Polish membership in EU [18], the
splitting is not observed; instead, the maxima of the appropriate distributions
shift in time from ’YES’ to ’NO’. In these cases, a given opinion does not imply
a personal solidarity with any group.

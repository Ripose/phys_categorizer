Abstract. The statistical properties of the bid-ask spread of a frequently traded Chinese stock listed on
the Shenzhen Stock Exchange are investigated using the limit-order book data. Three diﬀerent deﬁnitions
of spread are considered based on the time right before transactions, the time whenever the highest buying
price or the lowest selling price changes, and a ﬁxed time interval. The results are qualitatively similar no
matter linear prices or logarithmic prices are used. The average spread exhibits evident intraday patterns
consisting of a big L-shape in the morning and a small L-shape in the afternoon. The distributions of the
spread with diﬀerent deﬁnitions decay as power laws. The tail exponents of spreads at transaction level
are well within the interval (2, 3) and that of average spreads are well in line with the inverse cubic law
for diﬀerent time intervals. Based on the detrended ﬂuctuation analysis, we ﬁnd evidence of long memory
in the bid-ask spread time series for all three deﬁnitions, even after the removal of the intraday pattern.
The multifractal detrended ﬂuctuation analysis shows that the time series of bid-ask spread possesses
multifractal nature.

1 Introduction

The continuous double auction (CDA) is a dominant mar-
ket mechanism used to store and match orders and facil-
itate trading in most modern equity markets [1]. In most
of the order driven markets, there are two kinds of basic
orders, called market orders and limit orders. A market or-
der is submitted to buy or sell a number of shares at the
market quote which results in an immediate transaction,
while a limit order is placed to buy (or sell) a number of
shares below (or above) a given price. All the limit orders
that fail to result in an immediate transaction are stored
in a queue called limit-order book. Buy limit orders are
called bids while sell limit orders are called asks or oﬀers.
Best bid price b(t) and best ask (or best oﬀer) price a(t)
are the highest buying price and the lowest selling price
at any time t in the limit-order book. The best bid (or
ask) is called the same best for buy (or sell) orders, while
the best ask (or bid) is called the opposite best for buy (or
sell) orders. A limit order causes an immediate transac-
tion if the associated limit price penetrates the opposite

best price. We call such kind of limit orders marketable
limit orders or eﬀective market orders and other limit or-
ders are termed eﬀective limit orders. In the Chinese stock
market, only limit orders were permitted in the placement
of orders before July 1, 2006.

It is a dynamic process concerning the limit-order book.
Eﬀective limit orders accumulate in the book while ef-
fective market orders cause transactions and remove the
limit orders according to their price and the time they
arrive. Eﬀective limit orders can also be removed by can-
celation due to many reasons. Unveiling the dynamics of
order placement and cancelation will deepen our under-
standing of the microscopic mechanism of price formation
and allow us to reproduce remarkably many key features
of common stocks such as the probability distribution of
returns [2,3,4].

The diﬀerence between best ask price and best bid
price, s(t) = a(t) − b(t), is the bid-ask spread. There
is a huge ﬁnancial literature exploring diﬀerent compo-
nents of the bid-ask spread [5,6]. On the other hand, there
are several groups studying the statistical properties of
the bid-ask spread time series for diﬀerent stock markets.
Farmer et al. reported that the bid-ask spread deﬁned by

where the exponent ζ = 3.03 ± 0.41 ranging from 2.4 to
3.9 [7,4], which is well consistent with the inverse cubic
law [8,9,10]. In addition, Mike and Farmer found that the
spread possesses long memory with the Hurst index be-
ing 0.75 < H < 0.85 [4]. Plerou et al. adopted the 116
most frequently traded stocks on the New York Stock Ex-
change over the two-year period 1994-1995 to investigate
the coarse-grained bid-ask spread over a time interval ∆t
and found that the tail distribution decays as a power law
with a mean tail exponent of ζ = 3.0 ± 0.1 and the spread
after removing the intraday pattern exhibits long memory
with H = 0.73 ± 0.01 [11]. Qualitatively similar results
were found by Cajueiro and Tabak in the Brazilian equity
market where the mean tail exponent is ζ = 2.18 ranging
from 1.18 to 2.97 and the Hurst index is H = 0.68 ± 0.08
varying from 0.52 to 0.89 [12].

Due to the fast development of the economy of China
and the increasing huge capitalization of its stock mar-
ket, more concerns are attracted to study the emerging
Chinese stock market. In order to reduce the market risk
and speculation actions, the Chinese stock market adopts
t + 1 trading system and no market orders were permit-
ted until July 1, 2006, which may however consume the
liquidity of the market and cause the spread to show dif-
ferent properties when compared to other stock markets.
In this work, we shall investigate the probability distribu-
tion, long memory, and multifractal nature of the bid-ask
spread using limit-order book data on the Shenzhen Stock
Exchange (SSE) in China.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2,
we describe in brief the trading rules of the Shenzhen
Stock Exchange and the database we adopt. Section 3 in-
troduces three deﬁnitions of the bid-ask spread and inves-
tigates the intraday pattern in the spread. The cumulative
distributions of the spreads for diﬀerent deﬁnitions are dis-
cussed in Sec. 4. We show in Sec. 5 the long memory of the
spread based on the detrended ﬂuctuation analysis (DFA)
quantiﬁed by the estimate of the Hurst index. In Sec. 6, we
perform multifractal analysis on the bid-ask spread time
series utilizing the multifractal detrended ﬂuctuation anal-
ysis (MF-DFA). The last section concludes.

2 SSE trading rules and the data set

Our analysis is based on the limit-order book data of a
liquid stock listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. SSE
was established on December 1, 1990 and started its oper-
ation on July 3, 1991. The securities such as stocks, closed
funds, warrants and Lofs can be traded on the Exchange.
The Exchange is open for trading from Monday to Friday
except the public holidays and other dates as announced
by the China Securities Regulatory Commision. With re-
spect to securities auction, opening call auction is held
between 9:15 and 9:25 on each trading day, followed by

continuous trading from 9:30 to 11:30 and 13:00 to 15:00.
The Exchange trading system is closed to orders cancela-
tion during 9:20 to 9:25 and 14:57 to 15:00 of each trading
day. On the other open hours, unexecuted orders can be
removed. During 9:25 to 9:30 of each trading day, the Ex-
change is open to orders routing from members, but does
not process orders or process cancelation of orders.

Auction trading of securities is conducted either as a
call auction or a continuous auction. The term “call auc-
tion” (from 9:15 to 9:25) refers to the process of one-time
centralized matching of buy and sell orders accepted dur-
ing a speciﬁed period in which the single execution price
is determined according to the following three principles:
(i) the price that generates the greatest trading volume;
(ii) the price which allows all the buy orders with higher
bid price and all the sell orders with lower oﬀer price to be
executed; and (iii) the price which allows either buy or-
ders or sell orders to have all the orders identical to such
price to be executed.

The term “continuous auction” (from 9:25 to 11:30 and
from 13:00 to 15:00) refers to the process of continuous
matching of buy and sell orders on a one-by-one basis and
the execution price in a continuous trading is determined
according to the following principles: (i) when the best ask
price equals to the best bid price, the deal is concluded at
such price; (ii) when the buying price is higher than the
best ask price currently available in the central order book,
the deal is concluded at the best ask price; and (iii) when
the selling price is lower than the best bid price currently
available in the central order book, the deal is executed
at the best bid price. The orders which are not executed
during the opening call auction automatically enter the
continuous auction.

The tick size of the quotation price of an order for A
shares is RMB 0.01 and that for B shares is HKD 0.01.
Orders are matched and executed based on the principle
of price-time priority which means priority is given to a
higher buy order over a lower buy order and a lower sell
order is prioritized over a higher sell order; The order se-
quence which is arranged according to the time when the
Exchange trading system receives the orders determines
the priority of trading for the orders with the same prices.
We study the data from the limit-order book of the
stock SZ000001 (Shenzhen Development Bank Co., LTD)
in the whole year of 2003. The limit-order book records
high-frequency data whose time stamps are accurate to
0.01 second. The size of the data set is 3, 925, 832, in-
cluding 12, 965 invalid orders, 122, 034 order submissions
and cancelations in the opening call auction, 47, 576 order
submissions and cancelations during the cooling period
(9:25-9:30), and 3, 743, 257 valid events during the con-
tinuous auction. In continuous auction, there are 317, 015
cancelations of buy orders and 274, 929 cancelations of sell
orders, 889, 700 eﬀective market orders, and 2, 261, 613 ef-
fective limit orders. Table 1 shows a segment taken from
the limit-order book recordede on 2003/07/09. The seven
columns stands in turn for order size, limit price, time,
best bid, best ask, transaction volume, and buy-sell iden-
tiﬁer.

3 Deﬁning bid-ask spread

The literature concerning the bid-ask spread gives diﬀer-
ent deﬁnitions [3,4,5,6,7,11,12,13,14,15]. In this section,
we discuss three deﬁnitions according to sampling time
when best bid prices and best ask prices are selected to
deﬁne the spread. Some deﬁnitions are based on the trans-
action time, while the others are based on the physical
time. The latter scheme is actually a coarse-graining of
the data within a given time interval.

3.1 Deﬁnition I

The ﬁrst deﬁnition of the bid-ask spread used in this work
is the absolute or relative diﬀerence between the best ask
price and the best bid price right before the transaction,
that is,

s(t) = a(t) − b(t)

for absolute diﬀerence or

s(t) = log10[a(t)] − log10[b(t)]

(2a)

(2b)

this deﬁnition, the bid-ask spread is the average diﬀerence
between the best ask the best bid when transactions occur
over a ﬁxed time interval [11]:

s(t) =

si(t) ,

si(t) = ai(t) − bi(t) ,

(3)

N

N

i=1
X

where ai(t) and bi(t) are the best ask and bid prices in
the time interval (t − ∆t, t] and N is the total number of
transaction in the interval. We use ∆t = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
minute(s) to calculate the average spreads.

3.4 Intraday pattern

In most modern ﬁnancial markets, the intraday pattern
exists extensively in many ﬁnancial variables [17,18,19],
including the bid-ask spread [16]. The periodic pattern
has signiﬁcance impact on the detection of long memory
in time series [20]. To the best of our knowledge, the inves-
tigation of the presence of intraday pattern in the spreads
of Chinese stocks is lack.

Figure 1 shows the autocorrelation function hs(t)s(t + ℓ)i

as a function of the time lag ℓ for the average bid-ask
spread calculated from deﬁnition III with linear best bids
and asks. We note that the results are very similar when
logarithmic prices are adopted in the deﬁnition. We see
that there are spikes evenly spaced along multiples of 245
min, which is exactly the time span of one trading day.
What is interesting is that Fig. 1 indicates that the aver-
age spread also possesses half-day periodicity.

for relative diﬀerence. This was used to analyze the stocks
on the London Stock Exchange [7,4]. The size of the spread
time series is 895, 606.

3.2 Deﬁnition II

The best ask price or the best bid price may change due
to the removal of all shares at the best price induced by
an eﬀective market order, or the placement of an limit
order inside the spread, or the cancelation of all limit or-
ders at the best bid/ask price. Hence the bid-ask spread
does not always change when a transaction occurs, and
it nevertheless changes without transaction. This suggests
to introduce an alternative deﬁnition of the spread which
considers the the absolute or relative diﬀerence between
the best bid price and the best ask price whensoever it
changes. The expressions of deﬁnition II are the same as
those in Eq. (2) except that they have diﬀerent deﬁnitions
for the time t. The size of the spread time series is 142, 913.

bid-ask spread calculated from deﬁnition III with the time in-
terval ∆t = 1 min. Note that one trading day contains 245
trading minutes in the Chinese stock market.

Obviously, the time in the ﬁrst two deﬁnitions are on the
basis of “event”. An alternative deﬁnition considers the
average bid-ask spread over a time interval ∆t [16]. In

In order to quantify the intraday pattern, we introduce
a variable A(t), which is deﬁned as the average bid-ask

spread at time t for all the trading days, that is,

A(t) =

(4)

j=1

where M is the number of trading days in the data set and
sj(t) is the bid-ask spread at time t of day j. The spread
S(t) after removing the intraday pattern reads [11]

S(t) = s(t)/A(t) .

(5)

Figure 2 illustrates the intraday pattern of the bid-ask
spread with ∆t = 1 minute. The overall plot shows an
evident L-shaped pattern, which is consistent with the
one-day periodicity shown in the autocorrelation function
in Fig. 1. After the opening call auction, the spread A(t)
widens rapidly and reaches its maximum 0.0183 at the end
of the cooling auction (9:30). Then it decreases sharply in
ﬁfteen minutes and becomes ﬂat at a level of 0.0112 ±
0.0008 afterwards till 11:30. At the begin of continuous
auction in the afternoon, A(t) abruptly rises to 0.0133
and drops down to a stable level within about ten minutes
which maintains until the closing time 15:00. Therefore,
there are two L-shaped patterns each day, which suggests
that the wide spread is closely related to the opening of the
market. The intraday pattern makes no diﬀerence when we
use ∆t = 2, 3, 4, and 5 minutes.

distribution P (> s) of the spreads using deﬁnition I and
II, where linear prices are used. Since the minimum spread
equals to the tick size 0.01, the abscissa is no less than -
2 in double logarithmic coordinates and P (> 0.01) = 1
for both deﬁnitions. The proportion of s = 0.01 in the
ﬁrst deﬁnition is much larger than in the second deﬁni-
tion such that the P (> s) for the second deﬁntion drops
abruptly for small spreads s. The two distributions decay
as power laws with exponents ζI = 2.57±0.06 for deﬁnition
I and ζII = 2.30 ± 0.05 for deﬁnition II. When logarith-
mic prices are utilized, the spreads also follow power-law
tail distributions with ζI = 2.67 ± 0.03 for deﬁnition I
and ζII = 2.42 ± 0.04 for deﬁnition II. The corresponding
tail exponents ζI and ζII do not have much diﬀerence for
logarithmic and linear prices.

4 Probability distribution

The cumulative distributions of the bid-ask spread of stocks
in diﬀerent stock markets decay as power laws with the tail
exponent close to 3 for the major western markets [7,11,4]
and much smaller and more heterogeneous in an emerging
market [12]. Similar behavior is found in the Chinese stock
market. Figure 3 presents the complementary cumulative

the spreads calculated from deﬁnitions I and II using linear
prices.

Figure 4 illustrates the complementary cumulative dis-
tributions of the average spreads over time interval ∆t =
1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 minute(s) calculated from deﬁnition III
with linear prices. The average spreads have power-law
tails with the exponents equal to ζIII,1 = 2.99 ± 0.04,
ζIII,2 = 3.00 ± 0.04, ζIII,3 = 3.00 ± 0.05, ζIII,4 = 2.95 ± 0.05,
and ζIII,5 = 2.97 ± 0.06. Similarly, for logarithmic prices,
we ﬁnd similar power-law tail distributions with ζIII,1 =
3.07 ± 0.06, ζIII,2 = 2.95 ± 0.05, ζIII,3 = 3.00 ± 0.04,
ζIII,4 = 2.97 ± 0.07, and ζIII,5 = 2.98 ± 0.07. We ﬁnd that
all the tail exponents ζIII,∆t for both linear and logarith-
mic prices are very close to three and are independent to
the time interval δt, showing a nice inverse cubic law. This
is well in agreement with the results in the NYSE case for
∆t = 15, 30, and 60 min [11].

There are also signiﬁcant discrepancies. Comparing the
cumulative distributions in Fig. 4 and that on the NYSE
[11], signiﬁcant diﬀerences are observed. The distribution
of the spreads on the SSE decays much faster than that
on the NYSE for small spreads. In other words, the pro-
portion of small spreads is much larger on China’s SSE.

markers represent the real data and the solid lines are the best
ﬁts in the scaling ranges. The curves with ∆t > 1 has been
translated vertically for clarity.

Possible causes include the absence of market orders, no
short positions, the maximum percentage of ﬂuctuation
(10%) in each day, and the t + 1 trading mechanism in the
Chinese stock markets on the one hand and the hybrid
trading system containing both specialists and limit-order
traders in the NYSE on the other hand. The exact cause is
not clear for the time being, which can however be tested
when new data are available after the introduction of mar-
ket orders in July 1, 2006. Moreover, the PDF’s in SSE
drop abruptly after the power-law parts for the largest
spreads, which is not observed in the NYSE case [11].

5 Long memory

Another important issue about ﬁnancial time series is the
presence of long memory, which can be characterized by
its Hurst index H. If H is signiﬁcantly larger than 0.5 the
time series is viewed to possess long memory. Long mem-
ory can be deﬁned equivalently through autocorrelation
function C(ℓ) ∼ ℓ−γ and the power spectrum p(ω) ∼ ω−η,
where the autocorrelation exponent γ is related to the
Hurst index H by γ = 2 − 2H [21,22], and the power
spectrum exponent η is given by η = 2H − 1 [23,24].

There are many methods proposed for estimating the
Hurst index such as the rescaled range analysis (RSA) [25,
26,27,28,29,30], ﬂuctuation analysis (FA) [31], detrended
ﬂuctuation analysis (DFA) [32,20,21], wavelet transform
module maxima (WTMM) method [33,34,35,36,37], de-
trended moving average (DMA) [38,39,40,41,42], to list a
few. We adopt the detrended ﬂuctuation analysis.

The method of detrended ﬂuctuation analysis is widely
used for its easy implementation and robust estimation
even for a short time series [43,44,24,45]. The idea of
DFA was invented originally to investigate the long-range

 

dependence in coding and noncoding DNA nucleotides
sequence[32] and then applied to various ﬁelds including ﬁ-
nance. The method of DFA consists of the following steps.
Step 1: Consider a time series x(t), t = 1, 2, · · · , N . We

ﬁrst construct the cumulative sum

u(t) =

x(i),

t = 1, 2, · · · , N .

(6)

t

i=1
X

Step 2: Divide the series u(t) into Nℓ disjoint segments
with the same length ℓ, where Nℓ = [N/ℓ]. Each segment
can be denoted as uv such that uv(i) = u(l + i) for 1 6
i 6 ℓ, and l = (v − 1)ℓ. The trend of uv in each segment
can be determined by ﬁtting it with a linear polynomial
function
uv. Quadratic, cubic or higher order polynomials
can also be used in the ﬁtting procedure while the simplest
function could be linear. In this work, we shall adopt the
linear polynomial function to represent the trend in each
segment with the form:

e

uv(i) = ai + b ,

(7)

where a and b are free parameters to be determined by
the least squares ﬁtting method and 1 6 i 6 ℓ.

e

Step 3: We can then obtain the residual matrix ǫv in

each segment through:

ǫv(i) = uv(i) −

uv(i) ,

(8)

where 1 6 i 6 ℓ. The detrended ﬂuctuation function
F (v, ℓ) of the each segment is deﬁned via the sample vari-
ance of the residual matrix ǫv as follows:

e

F 2(v, ℓ) =

[ǫv(i)]2 .

(9)

ℓ

Note that the mean of the residual is zero due to the de-
trending procedure.

Step 4: Calculate the overall detrended ﬂuctuation func-

tion F (ℓ), that is,

Nℓ

Nℓ

F 2(ℓ) =

F 2(v, ℓ) .

(10)

v=1

Step 5: Varying the value of ℓ, we can determine the
scaling relation between the detrended ﬂuctuation func-
tion F (ℓ) and the size scale ℓ, which reads

F (ℓ) ∼ ℓH ,

(11)

where H is the Hurst index of the time series [43,21].

Figure 5 plots the detrended ﬂuctuation function F (ℓ)
of the bid-ask spreads from diﬀerent deﬁnitions using lin-
ear prices. The “fourth” F (ℓ) curve is for the average
spread after removing the intraday pattern. All the curves
show evident power-law scaling with the Hurst indexes
HI = 0.91 ± 0.01 for deﬁnition I, HII = 0.92 ± 0.01 for
deﬁnition II, HIII = 0.75 ± 0.01 for deﬁnition III, and
HIII = 0.77 ± 0.01 for deﬁnition without intraday pat-
tern, respectively. Quite similar results are obtain for log-
arithmic prices where HI = 0.89 ± 0.01 for deﬁnition I,

for deﬁnition III, and HIII = 0.76 ± 0.01 for deﬁnition
III without intraday pattern. The two Hurst indexes for
deﬁnitions I and II are higher than their counterparts on
the London Stock Exchange where “even time” is adopted
[4]. It is interesting to note that the presence of intraday
pattern does not introduce distinguishable diﬀerence in
the Hurst index and the two indexes for deﬁnition III are
also very close to those of average spreads in the Brazilian
stock market and on the New York Stock Exchange where
real time is used [11,12]. Due to the large number of data
used in the analysis, we argue that the bid-ask spreads
investigated exhibit signiﬁcant long memory.

according to L’Hˆospital’s rule.

Step 5: Varying the value of ℓ, we can determine the
scaling relation between the overall detrended ﬂuctuation
function Fq(ℓ) and the size scale ℓ, which reads

Fq(ℓ) ∼ ℓh(q) .

Figure 6 illustrates the dependence of the detrended
ﬂuctuation function Fq(ℓ) of the bid-ask spreads after re-
moving the intraday pattern in deﬁnition III for diﬀer-
ent values of q, where both linear prices and logarithmic
prices are used. The continuous lines are the best linear
squares ﬁts. The collapse of the data points on the linear
lines indicates evident power-law scaling between Fq(ℓ)
and ℓ. The slopes h(q) of the lines are h(−4) = 1.05±0.03,
h(−2) = 0.95±0.02, h(0) = 0.78±0.01, h(2) = 0.73±0.01,
and h(4) = 0.68 ± 0.01 for logarithmic prices and h(−4) =
1.11 ± 0.03, h(−2) = 0.99 ± 0.02, h(0) = 0.83 ± 0.01,
h(2) = 0.76±0.01, and h(4) = 0.70±0.01 for linear prices.
We note that the power-law scaling for q > 0 is excellent
while there are more ﬂuctuations for negative q.

6 Multifractal analysis

The detrended ﬂuctuation analysis (DFA) serves as a spe-
cial case of the multifractal detrended ﬂuctuation (MF-
DFA) analysis [46]. The MF-DFA is a well-established
method for the detection of multifractality in time series
to describe a possible spectrum of singularity. The ﬁrst
three steps of the MF-DFA is the same as the DFA: First,
calculate the cumulative sum u(t) using Eq. (6); Second,
divide u(t) into Nℓ disjoint segments and in each segment
remove the trend
uv from uv by Eq. (7); and third, ob-
tain the ﬂuctuate function F (v, ℓ) by Eq. (9). The rest two
steps of the MF-DFA are presented below [46].

Step 4: The overall qth order detrended ﬂuctuation
function is calculated by averaging over all the segments,
that is,

Fig. 6. Log-log plots of the detrended ﬂuctuation function
Fq(ℓ) of bid-ask spreads calculated from deﬁnition III having
removed the intraday pattern for ﬁve diﬀerent values of q with
both the linear and logarithmic price formations (shown in the
legend). The dots stand for the results calculated from the real
data and the continuous lines are the best ﬁts. The plots for
q = −2, q = 0, q = 2, and q = 4 are shifted upwards for clarity.

Qualitatively similar results are obtained when the
intraday pattern is not removed. The scaling exponents
are h(−4) = 0.86 ± 0.03, h(−2) = 0.80 ± 0.01, h(0) =
0.76 ± 0.01, h(2) = 0.73 ± 0.01, and h(4) = 0.69 ± 0.02 for
linear prices and h(−4) = 0.96±0.03, h(−2) = 0.86±0.01,

h(0) = 0.79 ± 0.01, h(2) = 0.74 ± 0.01, and h(4) = 0.64 ±
0.02 for logarithmic prices.

In the standard multifractal formalism based on parti-
tion function, the multifractal nature is characterized by
the scaling exponents τ (q), which is a nonlinear function
of q [47]. For each q, we can obtain the corresponding tra-
ditional τ (q) function through

τ (q) = qh(q) − Df ,

(15)

where Df is the fractal dimension of the geometric sup-
port of the multifractal measure [46]. In this work, we
have Df = 1. It is thus easy to obtain the generalized di-
mensions Dq = τ (q)/(q − 1) [48,49,50] and the singularity
strength function α(q) and the multifractal spectrum f (α)
via Legendre transform [47], which are α(q) = dτ (q)/dq
and f (q) = qα − τ (q).

Figure 7 shows the multifractal spectrum f (α) and the
scaling function τ (q) in the inset for linear and logarithmic
prices. One ﬁnds that the two tau(q) curves are nonlinear
which is the hallmark of the presence of multifractality.
The strength of the multifractality can be characterized
by the span of singularity ∆α = αmax−αmin. If ∆α is close
to zero, the measure is almost monofractal. The maximum
and minimum of α can be reached when q → ±∞, which
can not be achieved in real applications. However, ∆α can
be approximated with great precision with mediate values
of q. The large value of ∆α shown in Fig. 7 indicates a
broad spectrum of singularity.

liquidity. In this paper, we have performed empirical in-
vestigations on the statistical properties of the bid-ask
spread using the limit-order book data of a stock SZ000001
(Shenzhen Development Bank Co., LTD) traded on the
Shenzhen Stock Exchange within the whole year 2003.
Three diﬀerent deﬁnitions of spread are considered based
on event time at transaction level and on ﬁxed interval of
real time.

The distributions of spreads at transaction level de-
cay as power laws with tail exponents well below 3. In
contrast the average spread in real time fulﬁls the inverse
cubic law for diﬀerent time intervals ∆t = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
min. We have performed the detrended ﬂuctuation analy-
sis on the spread and found that the spread time series ex-
hibits evident long-memory in agreement with other stock
markets. The multifractal detrended ﬂuctuation analysis
unravels the multifractal nature of the spread time series,
where the Fq(ℓ) functions with positive orders have nice
power-law scaling over two orders of magnitude while the
scaling of negative order ﬂuctuation functions is slightly
worse. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time
to report the presence of multifractality in the spread.

Our analysis raises an intriguing open question that is
not fully addressed. We have found that the spread pos-
sesses a well-established intraday pattern composed by a
large L-shape and a small L-shape separated by the noon
closing of the Chinese stock market. This feature will help
to understand the cause of the wide spread at the opening
of the market, which deserves further investigation.

7 Conclusion

The bid-ask spread deﬁned by the diﬀerence of the best
ask price and the best bid price is considered as the bench-
mark of the transaction cost and a measure of market

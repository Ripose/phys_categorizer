News and price returns from threshold behaviour and vice-versa

Starting from an exact relationship between news and threshold distributions, I discuss the ability
of the Ghoulmie-Cont-Nadal model to produce fat-tailed price returns in the limit of large systems.
In particular, in this framework, Gaussian news lead to Gaussian price changes.

PACS numbers:

Few agent-based models of ﬁnancial markets are amenable to mathematical analysis. Notable exceptions include
percolation-based imitations models [1], behavioural switching models [2], and Minority Game-based models [3, 4]. A
new simple Markovian model of agents that learn past volatilities was recently introduced and exhibited promising
features [5]. Here, I report a simple analysis of this model in the limit of inﬁnite number of agents, and show how
the distribution of thresholds and news are related and that the distribution of the price returns depends on both
threshold and news distributions.

The model is deﬁned as follows [5]: N agents have a threshold θi, i = 1,

, N , and receive a signal ǫt at time t

from some known distribution ρ(ǫ). They submit orders when the signal exceed their threshold

Because of Eq. (2), for ﬁnite N , r(t) and θi take discrete values. The master equation for P (θ, t) is therefore

For example, P (τ ) = (α + 1)τ α corresponds to ρ(ǫ) = (α + 1)2ǫα(α+2), with λ = 1 in order to ensure normalisation
of ρ and
[0, 1]. Fig 1 conﬁrms the validity of the above calculations; the discrepancy
between numerical simulations and theoretical results for P (τ ) come from the fact that a ﬁnite fraction of players
end up with the same τ if there are more than one agent at a time that change their thresholds, that is, if s is not
much smaller than 1/N one way to cure this would be to add a small noise to the new threshold, or to introduce
heterogeneity in volatility tracking; for instance, agent i could update his threshold with θi(t + 1) = ci
where
ci would be drawn from a known distribution at the beginning of the simulations. The distribution of returns is not
aﬀected by this phenomenon, as shown by Fig 1.

In short, in the N

limit, this model does not seem to be able to transform Gaussian news into non-Gaussian
prices. Nevertheless, it is worthwhile to note that the volume seems to be clustered in time at least at short time
scales, which does not show up in these calculations. This model, thanks to its very simple framework, may allow
more reﬁned extensions to produce the desired eﬀect from Gaussian noise.

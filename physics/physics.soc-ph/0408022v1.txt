Abstract

We study a simple example of a sequential game illustrating prob-
lems connected with making rational decisions that are universal for
social sciences. The set of chooser’s optimal decisions that manifest his
preferences in case of a constant strategy of the adversary (the oﬀer-
ing player), is investigated. It turns out that the order imposed by the
player’s rational preferences can be intransitive. The presented quanti-
tative results imply a revision of the ”common sense” opinions stating
that preferences showing intransitivity are paradoxical and undesired.

1 Introduction

The intransitivity can occur in games with three or more strategies if the
strategies A, B, C are such that A prevails over B, B prevails over C, and
C prevails over A (A > B > C > A). The most known example of in-
transitivity is the children game ”Rock, Scissors, Paper” (R, S, P ) where
R > S > P > R. The other interesting example of intransitive order is
the so-called Condorcet’s paradox, known since XVIIIth century. Consider-
ations regarding this paradox led Arrow in the XXth century to prove the
theorem stating that there is no procedure of successful choice that would
meet the democratic assumptions [1].

In the paper, we present quantitative analysis of a model, which can be
illustrated by the Pitts’s experiments with cats, mentioned in the Steinhaus
diary [3] (Pitts noticed that a cat facing choice between ﬁsh, meat and milk
prefers ﬁsh to meat, meat to milk, and milk to ﬁsh!). This model ﬁnds
its reﬂection in the principle of least action that controls our mental and
physical processes, formulated by Ernest Mach [2] and referring to Ockham’s

razor principle.
Pitts’s cat, thanks to the above-mentioned food preferences, provided itself
with a balanced diet. Experiments with rats conﬁrmed Pitts’s observations.
Therefore, it is interesting to investigate whether intransitivity of preferences
will provide a balanced diet also in a wider sense in more or less abstract
situations involving decisions. Maybe in the class of randomized behaviors
we will ﬁnd the more eﬀective ways of nutrition? The following sections
constitute an attempt at providing quantitative answer to these questions.
The analysis of an elementary class of models of making optimal decision
presented below permits only determined behaviors, that is such for which
the agent must make the choice.

2 Nondeterministic cat

Let us assume that a cat is oﬀered three types of food (no 1, no 2 and no
3), every time in pairs of two types, whereas the food portions are equally
attractive regarding the calories, and each one has some unique components
that are necessary for the cat’s good health. Let us also assume that the
cat cannot consume both oﬀered types of food at the same moment, and
that it will never refrain from making the choice. The eight (23) possible
deterministic choice functions fk:

fk : {(1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1)} → {0, 1, 2},

k = 0, . . . , 7.

(1)

are deﬁned in Table 1. The functions f2 and f5 determine intransitive or-

ders. The parameters pk, k = 0, . . . , 7 give the frequencies of appearance of
the choice function in the nondeterministic algorithm (strategy) of the cat
(
Let us denote the frequency of occurrence of the pair (k, j) as qm, where m
P
2
is the number of food that does not occur in the pair (k, j) (
m=0 qm = 1).
This denotation causes no uncertainty because there are only three types of
food. When the choice methods fk are selected nondeterministically, with
the respective intensities pk, the frequency ωm, m = 0, 1, 2, of occurrence of
individual food in cat’s diet are according to Table 1. given as follows:

P

• food no 0: ω0 = (p0 + p1 + p2 + p3)q2 + (p0 + p1 + p4 + p5)q1,

2

• food no 1: ω1 = (p4 + p5 + p6 + p7)q2 + (p0 + p2 + p4 + p6)q0,

• food no 2: ω2 = (p2 + p3 + p6 + p7)q1 + (p1 + p3 + p5 + p7)q0.

Three equalities above can be explained with the help of the conditional
probability concept P (j|k). The number P (j|k) indicates the probability of
choosing the food of number j, when the oﬀered food pair does not contain
the food of number k. Since (according to the deﬁnition of conditional
1 is fulﬁlled, and the events
probability) the equality P (k&j) = P (k|j)qk
of choosing diﬀerent pairs of food are disjoint and comprise all the space
of elementary events. Hence, for each food chosen, we have the following
relation: ωj =
By inspection of the table of the functions fk, we easily get the following
relations:

m=0 P (j|m)qm.

P

P (0|2) = p0 + p1 + p2 + p3 ,
P (0|1) = p0 + p1 + p4 + p5 ,
P (1|0) = p0 + p2 + p4 + p6 ,
P (1|2) = 1 − P (0|2) ,
P (2|1) = 1 − P (0|1) ,
P (2|0) = 1 − P (1|0) .

occurs for such probabilities p0, . . . , p7, that the function min(ω0, ω1, ω2) has

mined by the point Q (cf. Fig. 1), or the lengths of the segments formed

A whole segment on the unit cube corresponds to one point of the simplex,
parametrized by λ. The range of this representation should be limited to
the unit cube, which gives the following conditions for the above subsequent
equations:

λ ∈ [0, 3q2], λ ∈ [1 − 3q1, 1], λ ∈ [3q2 − 1, 2 − 3q1].

(8)

The permitted values of the parameter λ form the common part of these
segments, hence it is nonempty for:

max(0, 1 − 3q1, 3q2 − 1) ≤ min(2 − 3q1, 3q2, 1).

(9)

Therefore

λ ∈ [max(0, 1 − 3q1, 3q2 − 1), min(2 − 3q1, 3q2, 1)].

(10)

It may be now noticed that for any triple of probabilities belonging to
the hexagon, there exists an optimal solution within a set of parameters
((P (0|2), P (0|1), P (1|0))).
If we assume the equal measure for each set of
frequencies of occurrence of food pairs as the triangle point, then we may
state that we deal with optimal algorithms in 2
3 of all the cases (it is the
ratio of area of regular hexagon inscribed into a equilateral triangle). The
inverse image of the area of frequencies (q0, q1, q2) of food pairs that enable
realization of the optimal algorithms, which is situated on the cube of all
possible algorithms, is presented by four consecutive plots in (Fig. 3). We
present there the same conﬁguration observed from diﬀerent points of view.
The segments on the ﬁgures correspond to single points of the frequency
triangle of the individual food pairs. The greatest concentration of the seg-
ments is observed in two areas of the cube that correspond to intransitive
algorithms2. The bright area in the center of the cube, which may be seen in
the last picture, belongs to the eﬀective algorithms — eﬀective in the subset
of frequencies of a small measure (q0, q1, q2) of the food pairs appearance.
Among them, the totally incidental behavior is located, which gives con-
sideration in equal amounts to all the mechanisms of deterministic choice

4 Intransitive nondeterministic decisions

In the case of random selections we may talk about order relation food no 0
< food no 1, when from the oﬀered pair (0, 1) we are willing to choose the
food no 1 more often than the food no 0 (P (0|2) < P (1|2)). Therefore we
have two intransitive orders:

• P (0|2) < 1

• P (0|2) > 1

2 , P (2|1) < 1
2 , P (2|1) > 1

2 , P (1|0) < 1
2 .
2 , P (1|0) > 1
2 .

It is interesting to see in which part of the simplex of parameters (q0, q1, q2)
we may take optimal intransitive algorithms. They form the six-armed star
composed of two triangles, each of them corresponding to one of two possi-
ble intransitive orders (Fig. 4). They dominate in the central part of triangle,
near
point
q0 = q1 = q2 = 1
3 . They form darkened part of area inside the star. Opti-
mal transitive algorithms cover the same area of the simplex as all optimal
algorithms, however they occur less often in the center of the simplex. We
illustrated this situation in the next picture (Fig. 5). In areas of high con-
centration of optimal transitive algorithms, one of three frequencies q0, q1,

pare the applicability range of diﬀerent types of optimal algorithms. Let us
assume the same measure of the possibility of occurrence of determined pro-
portion of all three food pairs. This assumption means that the probability
of appearance of the situation determined by a point in the triangle-domain
of parameters (q0, q1, q2) does not depend on those parameters. Two thirds
of algorithms are optimal. There are 33%3 of circumstances, which allow for
the use of the optimal algorithms that belong to the speciﬁed intransitive
order. There are 44% ( 4
9 ) of situations of any order that favor optimal algo-
rithms, what follows from the fact that they are measured by the surface of
regular star, and its area is equal to double area of the triangle correspond-
ing to one intransitive order reduced by the area of the hexagon inscribed
9 = 4
into the star. So we have: 1

the calculation can be easily explained by the observation that the area of
the regular six-armed star is two times bigger than the area of the hexagon
inscribed into it. This number (22%) is the measure of the events that favor
both types of intransitive algorithms.

It is worth to stress that in the situation that favors optimal algorithms
we can always ﬁnd the algorithm that determines the transitive order (see
Fig. 5). However, we should remember that this feature concerns only the
simple model of the cat’s behavior, and does not have to be true in the cases
of more complicated reaction mechanisms.

5 Conclusion

In this article, we used a stochastic variant of the principle of least action.
We presented a method, which allows successful analysis of intransitive or-
ders that still are surprisingly suspicious for many researchers.

The quantitative observations from the previous section show that in-
transitivity, as the way of making the decision, can provide the diet com-
pleteness for the cat from our example. Moreover, the intransitive optimal
algorithms constitute the major part of all optimal algorithms. Therefore,
it would be wrong to prematurely acknowledge the preferences showing the
intransitivity as undesired. Perhaps there are situations, when only the in-
transitive orders allow obtaining the optimal eﬀects. The most intriguing
problem that remains open, is to answer the question whether there exists
a useful model of optimal behaviors, which gives the intransitive orders,
and for which it would be impossible to specify the transitive optimal al-
gorithm of identical action results. Showing the impossibility of building
such constructions would cause marginalization of the practical meaning of
intransitive orders. On the other hand, indication of this type of models
would force us to accept the intransitive ordering.

Abstract

The paper revisits the investment simulation based on strategies
exhibited by Generalized (m, 2)-Zipf law to present an interesting char-
acterization of the wildness in ﬁnancial time series. The investigations
of dominant strategies on each speciﬁc time series shows that longer
words dominant in larger time scale exhibit shorter dominant ones
in smaller time scale and vice versa. Moreover, denoting the term
wildness based on persistence over short term trend and memory rep-
resented by particular length of words, we can see how wild historical
ﬂuctuations over time series data coped with the Zipf strategies.

Keywords: Generalized (m,2)-Zipf law, time series, ﬂuctuations, investment.

1 Introduction

In order to choose ﬁnancial products for investment (e.g.: stock indexes,
future exchange indexes, foreign exchange indexes) one often aware of how
fast a particular ﬁnancial values change over time by referring to its historical
time series. There are commonsensical thoughts that some markets are very
”wild” for price varies so fast and the other is not of price moves very slowly.
From the bottom-up perspective, it is apparent that the price movement will
eventually remain the market depth liquidity, i.e.: order ﬂow necessary to
move price by a given amount over time. In return, other thing that also
contributed to this issue is the ’market climate’ surrounding investors or
traders triggering the herding behavior over the market [6].

Ausloos and Bronlet [1] previously have described the way of texifying
the time series data and perform statistical aspects revealing the Zipf law. In
advance, they also propose an interesting investment strategy based on their
ﬁndings on power-laws inspired by the so-called DFA method. The Zipf law
of the ﬁnancial time series is presented by transforming the ups and downs of
ﬁnancial index ﬂuctuations into ”words” of m-length and k -types of ”letters”
[4]. Obviously, there are a lot of possibilities on representing the ﬁnancial
indexes into texts, but the rest of the paper will use the letter ”u” for higher
value over time respect to the price in the opening and closing session of
the market and ”d” for downward price movement - whether they can be
weekly, daily, sessional (morning and afternoon market sessions), and even
smaller time intervals, e.g.: hour, minutes, seconds [8]. However, concerning
the investment simulation, we will use the smallest interval of hourly [7].

The paper wants to open a new possible analytical door on ﬁnancial
market by bridging the investment-based paradigm and the adherence of the
generalized Zipf law. We see a possibility on a new and important way to
approach, characterize and extract information within the time series data by
analysis on the texiﬁed ﬂuctuations. The next section of the paper elaborates
the Zipf law in ﬁnancial data in the way we have the simulated investment
results by using the Generalized Zipf law. This is followed by discussions on
”wildness” of the time series data concerning the appropriate value of k used
in the simulation.

a = |2H − 1|

ε = p(u) − p(d)

2 Text from Time Series

By representing the price ﬂuctuations into, say two alphabets, we have pos-
sible words in the time series data equal to 2m = 22 possible words. They
are ”uu”, ”dd”, ”ud”, and ”du”. This is applied up to several numbers of
possible words. Thus, we sort frequency of occurrence of the words along
our data to have the illustration of the Zipf plot - rank the sequence started
from R = 1 for the most frequent words. According to Zipf law, we will have
relation of:

In accordance with R/S analysis, Bronlet, et. al. [4] showed the conjec-

ture relation:

It is important to note that the probability of ups (u) and downs (d) of
price in most of the case is not the same for every time series data. Here, we
found bias:

where p(n) and p(t) each is the probability of ups and downs in time series
data. In this case, we need to put into account the frequency of expectation
f ’, which represent random situation (un-correlated).
In this case, in our
calculation we use f ’ as the substitution from the original form of Zipf (f )
method with coeﬃcient of exponent a’. This mathematically can clearly
prevent the presence of exponent a = 0 which is possible to occur since those
biases. The value of f ’ can be calculated as

f ′ = pm−n(u).pn(d)

By now, we can start investment simulation for some ﬁnancial data from
various markets. This is aimed for us to have basic of prediction based on
scaling character from each ﬁnancial data in case of investment. Technically,
the question is: what would likely to happen if we have words sequence with
alphabet sequence length of (m − 1)?

If we have words sequence of c(t − m + 1), ..., c(t − 1), c(t), how big the
probability of c(t) to be ”up” or ”down”, with c(t) is showing the char-
acters of time t. From this point, we calculate the prediction based on

(5)

(7)

the words we have ranked in Zipf plot to ﬁnd the level of probability of
up, pup(t), that is the occurrence of sequence c(t − m + 1), .., c(t − 1), ”u”,
and the probability of down, pdown(t), or the occurrence of the sequence
c(t − m + 1), .., c(t − 1), ”d”. It is suggested [7] to consider variable of strength
parameter that is how far we can trust a calculation result, which is through
relative probability represented by:

D(t) = |

pup(t) − pdown(t)
pup(t) + pdown(t)

|

This D(t) parameter shows how big the probability of the prediction result
to have value within interval [0..1]. In the simulation, we use parameter D(t)
as a form of fraction of how many we ”buy” or ”sell” the index value. As we
know, we will pose to ”buy” when pup(t) > pdown(t) and vice versa. By the
simulation, simply we can write the outcome of investment after n time as

ψtotal = ψstart +

(pi − pi−1)Di

n

X
i=2

while in each time-steps we have

ψ(t) = ψ(t − 1) + [p(t) − p(t − 1)]D(t)

An example of our simulation result is depicted in ﬁgure 2 preceding
the Zipf law in Jakarta Composite Index (IHSG), DJIA, and NASDAQ on
each daily data in ﬁgure 1. Obviously, the ﬁgure shows that the dominant
investment strategy in IHSG is Zipf (6,2) while in DJIA and NASDAQ are
Zipf (4,2) and Zipf (5,2) respectively.

3 On wildness of ﬁnancial time series data

After transforming a series of ﬁnancial data into text and having simulation
result based on Zipf law in hand, plenty of analytical thoughts may appear.
The notion of relative wildness of ﬁnancial data can be treated as the way
we cope with the possibilities of ups and downs of the existing ﬂuctuations.
Obviously, when a time series data can be ’read’ well by the Generalized
Zipf law, we have a good view to cope with the wildness of the time series.
Furthermore, the length of the words suitable to gain better along the certain
time window of investment enriches our notion of this relative ’wildness’.

4

Here we can see how persistent a word along certain time. For example, if a
particular time series data get better gain while we use the rule of investment
of Zipf (7,2) relative to the one of Zipf (2,2), then we can say that the wildness
of the one with Zipf (7,2) is wilder than the other one. In other words, we can
say that concerning the short term trend persistence, time series represented
by 7 words in investment is less wild relative to the one with 2 words.

In advance, we can also assume that the persistence over particular words
as a memory eﬀect of time series data. In this perspective, apparently a less
wild time series has longer memory since the persistent trend is longer. This
is very interesting when we try to see the eﬀect in several speciﬁc ﬁnancial
data, e.g.: ﬁnancial indexes and foreign exchange rates.

In ﬁgure 3 and 4, we show the result of our investigation in daily Yen/USD
and Euro/USD data showing good gain in Zipf (3,2) and Zipf (2,2) respec-
tively. Comparing to the previous one in ﬁgure (2), we can say relatively that
both foreign exchange rates exhibit wilder ﬂuctuations regarding persistence
over trends and memory represented by the speciﬁc words. Certainly, we
can understand this since foreign exchange involves more traders with higher
sensitivity to fundamental issue relative to the market indexes.

The later question is whether or not the better strategies in a certain
ﬁnancial products are persistent over diﬀerent time scales. We do the similar
analysis to HangSeng Index, NIKKEI225 index, and GPB/USD rate over dif-
ferent time orders. Figure (9) and (12) shows our results with HangSeng and
NIKKEI225 indexes on respective time series data depicted in ﬁgure (7) and
(10). Interestingly, a wilder time series with shorter dominant words in small
time scale have longer words of dominant strategies in the larger time scale
and vice versa. This is showed by HangSeng Index whose dominant strategy
of Zipf (7,2) in daily data shrinks upto Zipf (4,2) in sessional data and Zipf
(3,2) in hourly in our investment simulation. In return, the dominant Zipf
(3,2) in daily NIKKEI225 investment simulation exhibits longer Zipf (6,2) in
sessional and hourly trading. This is very interesting while GBP/USD rate
shows similar situations of Zipf (7,2) in daily data and Zipf (8,2) in hourly
simulations.

Intuitively, by referring to the wildness of a time series, we could say that
there could be a pattern presented here. The time series shows less ’wildness’
in a certain time scale could have wilder in bigger or narrower time scale.
This opens further investigations in spite of the fact that the Generalized
Zipf analysis could yield a good prediction of time series ﬂuctuations.

4 Concluding Remarks and Further Works

We show the simulation result of investment by using the strategies laid upon
our understanding of Zipf law in texiﬁed ﬁnancial ﬂuctuation. We evaluate
the diﬀerent strategies regarding the length of words used in each simulation
and discover interesting properties over diﬀerent time series data and diﬀerent
time scale. In our simulations we can see that longer words dominant in larger
time scale exhibit shorter dominant ones in smaller time scale and vice versa.
In the other hand, we present that some ﬁnancial indexes are wilder than
other respect to the persistence of short term trend (represented by the words
or sequence of letters) and memory over ﬂuctuation patterns.

We expect to have more properties on doing several further investigations
by involving more letter (k > 2) and by trying to relate the ﬁndings with
terminologies often used to analyze the memory, distributions, and correla-
tions of the time series. Here, notwithstanding, we have seen some possible
and interesting ﬁndings of the textual analysis upon texiﬁed time series data
more than the advantage of the analysis as a good and promising prediction
method.

The eﬀects of networking on the extent of cooperation emerging in a competitive setting are
studied. The evolutionary snowdrift game, which represents a realistic alternative to the well-known
Prisoner’s Dilemma, is studied in the Watts-Strogatz network that spans the regular, small-world,
and random networks through random re-wiring. Over a wide range of payoﬀs, a re-wired network
is found to suppress cooperation when compared with a well-mixed or fully connected system. Two
extinction payoﬀs, that characterize the emergence of a homogeneous steady state, are identiﬁed. It
is found that, unlike in the Prisoner’s Dilemma, the standard deviation of the degree distribution is
the dominant network property that governs the extinction payoﬀs.

Evolutionary game theory has become an important
tool for investigating and understanding cooperative or
altruistic behavior in systems consisting of competitive
entities, may the systems be biological, ecological, eco-
nomics, social, and political in nature. Mathematicians,
biologists, and physicists alike have found the phenom-
ena of emergence of cooperative behavior fascinating.
Since the ground-breaking work on repeated or iterated
games based on the Prisoner’s Dilemma (PD) by Axel-
rod [1, 2], there has been a continuous eﬀort on exploring
the determining factors on possible cooperative behavior
in evolutionary games based on PD and its variations
[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], with a recent emphasis on the eﬀects of
spatial structures such as regular lattices [5, 6, 9, 10, 11]
and networks [8, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. Remarkably, it
was found that cooperation can be induced in a repeated
PD by cleverly designed strategies, and spatial structures
are found to favor cooperative behavior in evolutionary
PD. Emergence phenomenon and the physics of networks
[18] are among the most rapidly growing branches in
physics.

The present work was motivated by the recent con-
cerns on whether PD should be the sole model for study-
ing emerging cooperative phenomena [6]. Due to practi-
cal diﬃculties in accurately quantifying the payoﬀs, the
snowdrift game (SG) has been proposed as possible al-
ternative to PD. Previous work on SG have focused on
the eﬀects of connectivity in structures such as lattices
[6] and fully connected networks [6, 19]. In the present
work, we investigate the networking eﬀects on an evo-
lutionary snowdrift game [6, 20, 21] within the Watts-
Strogatz (WS) [18, 22] model of small world constructed
by randomly re-wiring a regular network. Starting with
a random mixture of competing nodes of opposite char-
acters, we found that (i) the steady-state population may

consist of only one kind of nodes or a mixture of nodes of
diﬀerent characters, depending on degree K in a regular
world before re-wiring and the extent of re-wiring q, (ii)
for a wide range of payoﬀs, a re-wired network suppresses
the fraction of cooperative nodes in the steady-state when
compared with a fully connected network or well-mixed
case, (iii) networking eﬀect on the critical payoﬀs for the
extinction of one kind of nodes in the steady state de-
pends sensitively on the width or standard deviation of
the degree distribution induced by re-wiring.

The snowdrift game, which is equivalent to the hawk-
dove or chicken game [20, 21], is best described using
the following scenario. Consider two drivers hurrying
home in opposite directions on a road blocked by a snow-
drift. Each driver has two possible actions – to shovel the
snowdrift (cooperate (C)) or not to do anything (not-to-
cooperate or “defect” (D)). This is similar to the PD
game in which each player can choose to cooperate or to
defect. If the two drivers cooperate, they could be back
home on time and each will get a reward of b. Shovelling
is a laborious job with a total cost of c. Thus, each driver
gets a net reward of R = b
c/2. If both drivers take
action D, they both get stuck, and each gets a reward of
P = 0. If only one driver takes action C and shovels the
snowdrift, then both drivers can go home. The driver
taking action D (not to shovel) gets home without doing
anything and hence gets a payoﬀ T = b, while the driver
taking action C gets a “sucker” payoﬀ of S = b
c.
The SG refers to the case when b > c > 0, leading to
T > R > S > P . This ordering of the payoﬀs deﬁnes
the SG. Without loss of generality, it is useful to assign
R = 1 so that the payoﬀs can be characterized by a sin-
gle parameter r = c/2 = c/(2b
c) for the cost-to-reward
ratio. In terms of 0 < r < 1, we have T = 1 + r, R = 1,
r, and P = 0. For a player, the best action is:
S = 1

−

to take D if the opponent takes C, otherwise take C. The
SG becomes the PD when the cost c is high such that
2b > c > b > 0, which amounts to T > R > P > S
[23, 24]. Therefore, the SG and PD diﬀer only by the
ordering of P and S. Due to the diﬃculty in measur-
ing payoﬀs in game theory, the SD represents a possible
alternative to PD in studying emerging cooperative phe-
nomena [6, 19].

Evolutionary SG amounts to letting the character of
a connected population of inhomogeneous players evolve,
according to their performance [6]. Consider N play-
ers represented by the nodes of a network. Initially, the
nodes are randomly assigned to be either of C or D char-
acter. The character of each node is updated every time
step simultaneously. At each time step, every node i
interacts with all its connected ki neighbors and gets a
payoﬀ per neighbor V i = Vi/ki, where Vi is obtained by
summing up the ki payoﬀs after comparing characters
with its neighbors. Every node i then randomly selects
a neighbor j for possible updating or evolution. To com-
pare performance of the two nodes i and j, we construct

wij = (Vj

Vi)/(T

P ) = (Vj

Vi)/(1 + r).

(1)

−

−

−

If wij > 0, then the character of node i is replaced by the
character of node j with probability wij .
If wij < 0,
then the character of node i remains unchanged. As
time evolves, a steady state will be attained with pos-
sible coexistence of nodes of both characters. The frac-
tion of C-nodes fC, which is also called the frequency
of cooperators [6], measures the extent of cooperation
in the whole system in the steady state and is deter-
mined by the structure of the underlying network and
the payoﬀ parameter r. For a fully connected network,
fC = 1
In two-dimensional lattices with
nearest-neighboring and next-nearest neighboring con-
nections, it has recently been observed that the spatial
structure tends to lower fC [6], when compared with a
fully connected network. In contrast, spatial connections
are found to enhance fC in evolutionary PD games.

r [6, 19].

Here, the nodes in an evolutionary SG are connected
in the form of the Watts-Strogatz small-world model [22].
Starting with a one-dimensional regular world consisting
of a circular chain of N nodes with each node having a
degree 2K connecting to its 2K nearest neighbors, each
of the K links to the right hand side of a node is cut
and re-wired to a randomly chosen node with a proba-
bility q. This simple model gives the small world eﬀect
[22], which refers to the commonly observed phenomena
of small separations between two randomly chosen nodes
in many real-life networks [18], for q
0.1. The pa-
rameter q thus takes the network from a regular world
through the small world to a random world, with a ﬁxed
mean degree
= 2K. Here, we aim at understanding
how the frequency of cooperators fC behaves as the pa-
rameters characterizing the the spatial structure K and

Figure 1(a) shows fC as a function of r in regular lat-
tices (q = 0) of N = 103 nodes with diﬀerent values
of K. The dotted line gives the result fC = 1
r for
the well-mixed case. Three features should be noted: (i)
there exists a value rD(K, q = 0) so that fC = 1 for
r < rD, i.e., the extinction of D-nodes and all nodes
become cooperative in nature, (ii) for a wide range of
r, the frequency of cooperators drops below that in the
well-mixed case, (iii) there exists a value rC (K, q = 0) so
that fC = 0 for r > rC , i.e., the extinction of cooperative
nodes. Figures 1(b) and 1(c) show that the extinction
payoﬀ for defectors (cooperators) rD (rC ) decreases (in-
creases) monotonically with K in regular lattices. For

satisﬁed. The feature (ii) is analogous to that observed
in two-dimensional lattices [6]. For r < rD, fC is en-
hanced by allowing 2K neighboring links, when compared
with a fully connected network. We have also found that
rD and rC are independent of the number of nodes N .

[18, 22] decreases with q in WS networks. This is, how-
ever, not what is observed in numerical results. There-
fore, the clustering coeﬃcient C is also not the deter-
mining factor for rD and rC . These observations are in
sharp contrast to the networking eﬀects in evolutionary
PD games [12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. Noting that the WS net-

The results in Figures 1 and 2 revealed that the extinc-
tion payoﬀs rD(K, q) and rC (K, q) depend on both struc-
tural parameters K and q. It does remain an intriguing
problem of which geometrical property (properties) of a
re-wired network determines rD and rC . In what follows,
we will focus on analyzing rD(K, q), as rC
2rD. Fig-
ure 3 shows collectively the results of rD(K, q) for diﬀer-
ent values of K and q. Interestingly, we found that by
plotting (1/rD(K, q)
1/rD(K, q = 0)) as a function of
q, all the numerical data fall basically on the same curve
F (q), as shown in Figure 4. Examining the form of F (q),
we notice that it is related to the standard deviation σ
of the degree distribution P (k). Re-wiring changes P (k)
gradually from a delta-function at k = 2K for q = 0 to a
distribution that has a lower cutoﬀ at k = K with a ﬁnite
σ(K, q) that increases with q [18]. More speciﬁcally,

As the shortest path L = N/4K scales with N in regu-
lar lattices, the results imply that the K-dependence of
the extinction payoﬀs does not come from L, although L
is an important quantity in the description of networks.
Clearly, the time it takes the system to attain the steady
state would depend on N and hence L.

Going beyond regular lattices, Figure 2(a) shows fC
as a function of r in Watts-Strogatz networks with dif-
ferent re-wiring probabilities q = 0.01, 0.3 and 1.0. The
network consists of N = 103 nodes and K = 3. Results
in a regular lattice (q = 0) and fully connected networks
(dash line) are also included for comparison. It is noted
that the eﬀect of increasing q for ﬁxed K is similar to in-
creasing K for ﬁxed q = 0 (regular lattices). Figures 2(b)
and (c) show that, for ﬁxed K, the extinction payoﬀ rD
(rC ) drops (rises) with the extent of re-wiring q. We have
checked that while the shortest path L(q) changes sensi-
tively with q, it is however not the determining factor for
the extinction payoﬀs. Will the clustering coeﬃcient C
matter? For regular lattices, C increases with K and sat-
urates at large K following C(0) = 3(2K

In summary, we investigated the extent of cooperation
that would emerge in a networked evolutionary snowdrift
game. The random re-wiring model of Watts and Stro-
gatz is used. Comparing to a fully connected network,
networking leads to a suppressing of fC over a wide range
of the payoﬀ r. We identiﬁed two extinction payoﬀs rD
and rC . The dependence of rD(K, q) on K and q is highly
non-trivial. The key network property that gives the q-
dependence is found to be the standard deviation of the
degree distribution. This ﬁnding, in turn, implies that
it is the existence of nodes with higher degrees due to
randomly re-wiring that plays a dominant role in deter-
mining the extinction payoﬀs.

Abstract

Stylized facts of empirical assets log-returns Z include the existence of (semi) heavy tailed
distributions fZ (z) and a non-linear spectrum of Hurst exponents τ (β). Empirical data con-
sidered are daily prices of 10 large indices from 01/01/1990 to 12/31/2004. We propose a
stylized model of price dynamics which is driven by expectations. The model is a multi-
plicative random process with a stochastic, state-dependent growth rate which establishes a
negative feedback component in the price dynamics. This 0-order model implies that the
distribution of log-returns is Laplacian fZ (z) ∼ exp(− |z|
α ), whose single parameter α can be
regarded as a measure for the long-time averaged liquidity in the respective market. A com-
parison with the (more general) Weibull distribution shows that empirical daily log returns
are close to being Laplacian distributed. The spectra of Hurst exponents of both, empirical
data τemp and simulated data due to our model τtheor, are compared. Due to the ﬁnding of
non-linear Hurst spectra, the Renyi entropy (RE) Rβ(fZ)is considered. An explicit functional
form of the RE for an exponential distribution is derived. Theoretical REs of simulated asset
return trails are in good agreement with the RE estimated from empirical returns.

We regard a ﬁnancial market as a large complex system. Then Statistical Physics implies that
(some of its) macro observables, such as prices, might be independent from its micro realizations
and therefore are common to almost all realizations of the system. Indeed the statistical behavior
of price ﬂuctuations on diﬀerent markets exhibit much structure that is common to ’all’ ﬁnan-
cial markets. These properties are called ’stylized facts’, for an enlightening survey see [4] and
also the monographs [3, 9]. In turn, the existence of stylized facts suggests that price trails of dif-
ferent assets are realizations of a more general random/complex system, called ’a ﬁnancial market’.

Prices are macro observables of a ﬁnancial market in that their time evolution is generated
by the successive trading activities of a huge amount of ﬁnancial agents. This justiﬁes to take a
macroscopic perspective for modeling. The idea of our model is the following:

People go the ﬁnancial market to make their money work. They do so by investing their money
into assets. If the agent has capital m to invest in asset A, he can buy |A| = m
x units of this asset
for its price x. A unit of this asset has an expected value D some time later. Hence at this time,
the money m invested in asset A has value

M =

m

D
x

If the agent is lucky, then at the expiration time D
a factor

x > 1, and his money m has become valuable by

=

y =

x > 1. Thus, depending on his expectation about the future value of D

M
m
It is reasonable to assume that the agent wants to spend his money in an asset of which he expects
that D
x the agents buy or
sells this asset. Therefore, if the agent expects that D
x > 1, he will buy, otherwise he will sell. This
causes an increase (decrease) of demand in this asset. Due to the increase (decrease) of demand,
the price will rise (fall). Therefore, price evolution is thought to depend on the expected growth
rate.

Theoretical results due to our model are compared with empirical data from daily returns in
the period from 01/01/1990 to 112/31/2004 of 10 large indices listed in table 1. Results concern
i.) the non-gaussian distribution of log-returns, ii) the non-linear Hurst spectrum of return trials,
and iii.) the Renyi entropy.

1 An expectation driven market

The price process X of an index from time 0 to time t is described a the concatenation of n
independent trading periods Tτ = [τ, τ + 1), where ′[τ,′ and ′, τ + 1)′ can be regarded as the
opening time or the closing time of this period. The process from then is

[ 0, t ) = [ 0, 1) ⋆ [ 1, 2) ⋆ . . . ⋆ [ t − 1, t)

Let x be the closing price of period Tτ and x′ the opening price of the next period. Are x and x′
independent from each other? In reality there is night between both periods in which a lot can
happen. On the other hand, reality tells us that the opening price does not diﬀer too much from
the former closing price. Now, we assume that the process can be described as a concatenation of
independent processes deﬁned on periods Tτ . This means that we assume that prices x = Xτ ) and
x′ = X[τ +1 are independent.

We consider a simple 1-period model [t, t′) of a ﬁnancial market with only one asset, whose
price at time t is x > 0. Prices on this market are supposed to follow a multiplicative random
process given by

x′ = Γ x

where x′ is the price at time t′. The growth rate Γ > 0 is assumed to be due to the expectations
investors have at this time about future prices: Investors are supposed to build their believes about
the growth rate based on some economic entity available today. A particular simple setting is that
the expected growth rate is an increasing function of an expected dividend yield or earnings rate
y, i.e.

while Φ(0) = 0. D represents is a non-negative random variable which is distributed according to
some (stationary) distribution F in some ﬁnite interval [0, d].

In the following we assume that for all t, Φ is a power law, i.e.

Γ = ΓD(x) := Φ

where α ≥ 0 is a constant. The second assumption is about the distribution F :

This assumption is due to the lack of knowledge about the entity D. As well known, if all values
within the interval are taken with equal probability, the uniform distribution is the unique distribu-
tion that minimizes information. This can be taken as the statement that all possible information
are arbitraged away from a ﬁnancial market.

For further improvement of the model, it might be interesting to list the assumptions made.

1. The ﬁnancial market contains only 1 asset;

2. Due to equation 4 the result holds for a 1-period model;

3. Due to equation 3 payoﬀs are uniformly distributed within a ﬁxed ﬁnite interval;

4. Due to equation 2, the growth rate is Γ(x) is a power law with a constant scaling exponent

α.

Hence the model must be regarded as a 0-order approximations. Particularly, a ﬁnancial
market contains more than one asset, see (1), the price evolution is a process rather than can be
described by a series of independent periods, see (2), (3) is reasonable only if one assumes that for
all times all values in [0, d] are equally probable.

Assumption (4) has an interpretation in terms of market liquidity. Let us assume that the

volume traded is a function of the price

i.e. the more costly the asset is the smaller is the amount of this asset that can be bought by one
unit of capital. Then the price change Z = lnx′/x generated by a trade of volume V (x) at price x
yields

V = V (x) ∼

x

Z(x) = ln

α

x′

∼ α ln V (x),

D
x

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

up to some additive constant. Therefore the price impact of a trade of size V at price x equals

dZ(x) = α d ln V (x).

(6)

Hence if α ≈ 0, a large trading volume is necessary to move the price.

Therefore α can be regarded as a kind of elasticity of the market at the price level x, that
might economically understood as a measure of current market depth or its liquidity [5]. In the
light of this interpretation of the parameter α, the fourth assumption means that liquidity should
be independent of the price level and moreover constant for any time period.

Being aware of these assumptions, we compare our result, equation 5, with real data. Deviations
of empirical return distributions from our theoretical result shall indicate which assumptions we
have to modify to get a better model.

2 Numerical estimates of ”old friends”

Table 1 displays the set of indices considered1. Dealing with indices, makes it necessary to discuss
the meaning of the entity D. Originally D was meant as representing the process of expected
dividend pay oﬀ. Indices do not pay oﬀ dividends. Staying close to this interpretation, D has
to be regarded here as a sum of expected dividend ﬂows of the constituting assets. Furthermore,
expected dividend are not the only source of signals that aﬀect expectations about the growth
rate of an index. Thus signals are usually summarized as ’news’ in the economic literature. Hence
D could also be regarded as representing the news process in the market. The broader picture
therefore is that D represents the process of any signal that aﬀects expectations about growth
rates of the respective market. The ﬁrst question to be considered is to which degree our theo-

Figure 1: Returns distributions of the S&P 500, left: a semi-logarithmic plot, right: a double logarithmic
plot

retical result, equation 5, agrees with empirical data. Let us ﬁrst have a look at the distributions
at the S&P 500, see Figure 1. The left picture is a semi-logarithmic plot and the right picture
is a double logarithmic plot of daily returns from 01/01/1990 to 12/31/2004. Cross hairs mark
negative returns and dots display positive returns. Recall that an exponential distribution in a
semi-logarithmic plot becomes a straight line, while a straight line in a double logarithmic plot
corresponds to a power-law distribution. Numerical estimates of the parameter can be found in
Appendix A.

Quantile-Quantile plots provide a good descriptive method to judge about whether two sets of
data come from the same distribution. A line indicates that data in both sets are very likely to
come from the same distribution. As an example, let us consider the S&P 500, see Figure 2.

Figure 2 shows the QQ-plot of the empirical time series of log returns Z with respect to an
exponential distribution. The left column considers positive log-returns Z+ := Z≥0, while the
right column is for negative log-returns Z− := Z≤0. The ﬁrst row displays the QQ - plots of Z±
which respect to the exponential, while the second row displays a QQ-plots for ln |Z±| with respect
to the logarithm of the exponential. The scheme see in Figure 2 thus is:

Z+
ln Z+ ln |Z−|
1In this version, only the results for S&P 500 are shown. They are in fact representative for the others considered.

Z−

Figure 2: QQ-plots of the S&P500 with respect to the exponential distribution

The QQ plots of all indices considered show the same pattern: While the middle part of each
QQ-plot is linear, systematic deviations from the straight line in the QQ-plots occur for either
small returns or large returns. Particularly, deviations from the diagonal for the QQ-plot of Z±
are seen for high quantiles, while deviations form the line in the QQ-plot of ln |Z±| exists for small
quantiles. This means that empirical returns deviate from being exponentially distributed for very
large returns, see the ﬁrst row, and for very small returns, see the second row. This agrees with the
observations in the respective pdf’s, where we see that typically the empirical pdf has less mass in
0 than the Laplacian, while it’s tails are usually fatter than those from the Laplacian.

Fgures show the degree to which our elementary mouse model ﬁts to empirical data: Deviations
from a clear linear relation exist either for small returns and for large returns, while in the middle
range, this method indicates that the proposed double exponential distribution provides a fairly
good description of the empirical data.

3 On multiscaling in time series of log-returns

Stylized facts are important statistical properties since they are seen in the empirical returns of
’all’ ﬁnancial markets. Besides the non-Gaussian character of empirical asset returns distributions,
a second important fact concerns multiscaling in the time series of empirical asset returns. The
existence of multiple scales in the system implies that returns distributions are not invariant under
the choice of diﬀerent time-scales, i.e. one observes that the distribution of returns with lags of
the order of minutes, days, week, and so forth deviate from each other, see [13, 6].

In the following we estimate the scaling exponent (’Hurst exponent’)

E

|Z(t, T )|q

∼ tτ (q).

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

from time series of returns Z(t, T ) = ln x(t+T )
x(t) with time scale T . In our 1-period model, T = 1. It
can be shown that τ (0) = −1, while τ is increasing and concave. For a simple (fractional) diﬀusion
process, τ is a linear function of q. The deviation of τ from being linear, is an important issue in
determining the multi scaling nature of the underlying process. Figure 3 show τ (q) as a function
of q for various indices compared with our model. For orientation, the dotted straight line has a
slope to 1/2, which corresponds to Gaussian diﬀusion, while the solid line is the estimated graph
of scaling exponents in our model. Multi-fractal processes have been proposed as a new formalism

Figure 3: non-linear Hurst spectrum in the time series of daily returns of the S&P500 (right), to
be compared with our model with the estimated α, see tables 2, 3 (left)

for modeling the time series of returns in ﬁnance. The major attraction of these processes is their
capability of generating various degrees of long-memory in diﬀerent powers of returns - a feature
that has been found to characterize virtually all ﬁnancial prices, see [10, 7, 1]. The prominent issue
of these modeling approaches is the use of cascading processing.

The multifractal formalism is interesting even from another point of view. It may open the
door wider to bring two disciplines closer to each other: Statistical Physics and Financial Markets,
the connection being the R´eny entropy’. For an introduction into the ﬁeld of thermodynamics and
non-linear systems and related concepts see [2].

4 The Renyi Entropy of our stylized ﬁnancial market

Time series of log-returns show multiscaling. The Renyi entropy has proven to be a reasonable
entropy measure for multifractal systems in which long-range correlations exists. We therefore
estimate the Renyi entropy deﬁned by

Rβ(p) =

for a system with r micro states and a zooming parameter β ∈ R. Figure 4 shows the Renyi en-

To estimate the parameter α from measuring the Renyi entropy, it is therefore suﬃcient to consider
two cases, β = 0, 1, where R0(p) := limβ→0 Rβ(p) and R1(p) := limβ→1 Rβ(p). From its deﬁnition
it immediately follows the well known relation

Since C1 = C1(α, r), equations 10 and 11 allow to estimate the distribution parameter α from
empirical data - under the hypothesis that the distribution of Z is exponential.

We calculate the Renyi entropy for return trails of each single index 1, .., 10, see Table 1, for a
ﬁxed number of cells r = 30, see Figure 5. Former estimates of the asymmetry of the distribution of
negative returns and positive returns, measured by the parameters α± showed that the distribution
is (almost) symmetric. Hence we considered the trail of absolute returns, i.e. | ln Z|. We normalized
returns to the unit interval by considering |Z ∗| = |Z|emp
. The left upper picture shows the
distribution of |Z ∗| and a ﬁt with respect to the exponential distribution given the (adjusted) α
estimated from the exponential distribution as in Appendix A. The upper right picture shows the
resulting empirical Renyi entropy (solid line) and the graph of Rβ(p) from equation 9 (dashed line).
The prediction of our model agrees fairly well with the data. The logarithmic plots in the lower

max |Z|emp

Figure 5: S&P 500: Distribution of absolute returns and Renyi entropy

row show the deviations for small β ∈ [0, 3] and large β ∈ [25, 50], see Figure 5. Recalling that β
is a zooming factor, which places emphasis on diﬀerent probability regimes, these deviations agree
with the ﬁndings stated earlier: Our model gives too much mass to high probabilities, related to
small returns, while it does not give enough mass in the tails, i.e. for large returns.

5 Conclusion

All models are wrong but some are useful.
– G. E. P. Box, 1979

Our aim is to understand price dynamics on a ﬁnancial market. The existence of stylized facts
suggests that price trails of diﬀerent ﬁnancial markets might be regarded as diﬀerent realizations of
a more general stochastic system, called ’The ﬁnancial market’. If so then the question is about the
nature of this system. Since prices are macro-observables of a ﬁnancial market, the model about
price dynamics is deﬁned on the macro level. Due to the set of assumptions used in its derivation,
this model is an approximation in itself. Results therefore can also only as zero-approximations as
indicated by the list of assumptions made. We estimated three major properties: the distribution
of (logarithmic) asset returns, the Hurst exponent in their time series, and ﬁnally the R`eny entropy.
Although the model is a zero-order approximation, theoretical results are already in fairly good
agreement with real data. First-order corrections concerning the set of assumptions made should
improve these theoretical ﬁndings. Taking all this together, this model might serve as a good
starting point for further improvements. These steps should follow from observing where our
theoretical results deviate from empirical data and by successively and modestly modifying the
assumptions made.

A Quantitative estimation of parameters

We compare two distributions with respect to their goodness to ﬁt empirical data. One is the
exponential with parameter α, while the other one is the Weibull with parameters (a, µ)

The exponential distribution is obtains from the Weibull in the case µ = 1, while in the limit µ → 0,
fZ(z) approximates the Pareto distribution arbitrarily well, see [8]. Fits of the distributions for
positive and negative returns due to these distributions therefore give respective parameters

To make diﬀerences more obvious, we standardize log returns in the usual way

(cid:0)

where Z ′
± are the positive and negative returns, respectively, and σ denotes the respective standard
deviation. Therefore the estimates parameter µ is of special interest. In the following we summa-
rize log likely ﬁts of positive and negative returns, respectively, to the exponential distribution and
the Weibull distribution, giving parameters α± and (a±, µ±) respectively.

Distributions are close to being symmetric α+ ≈ α−, see tables 3 and 2. Furthermore 0 ≪
m± ≈ 1, i.e.
their distributions are close to an exponential distribution. This ﬁnding is also
supported by considering the respective entropic distances between the empirical distribution and
the exponential and Weibull distribution respectively as formalized by the Akaike’s Information
Criterion

AIC = −2 log

L(ˆθ|x)

+ 2 K,

(cid:18)
where K is the number of parameters, here K=1 for the exponential and K = 2 for the Weibull
distribution. The term 2 K can be considered as a penalty for introducing additional parameters.
L(ˆθ|x) is the maximum log-likelihood of the parameter θ given the data x. AIC is in particular
useful for nested model such as the exponential and the Weibull in this case. However, we considered
the ratio of the AIC’s of both models

(cid:19)

ratio =

L(exponential) + 1
L(W eibull) + 2

,

As seen in tables 3 and 2, the ratio is close to 2/3, which indicates that the approximation that
the distribution of log returns is an exponential is quite well and that we can trust the estimated
parameters αk.

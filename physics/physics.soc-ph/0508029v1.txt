Abstract. – We introduce stochastic driving in the Sznajd model of opinion spreading.
This stochastic eﬀect is meant to mimic a social temperature, so that agents can take random
decisions with a varying probability. We show that a stochastic driving has a tremendous
impact on the system dynamics as a whole by inducing an order-disorder nonequilibrium phase
transition. Interestingly, under certain conditions, this stochastic dynamics can spontaneously
lead to agents in the system who are analogous to Galam’s contarians.

Introduction. – The study of complex systems, in particular the application of statisti-
cal physics methods to social phenomena, has recently attracted the attention of theoretical
physicists [1–5]. From a statistical physics perspective, social systems are modeled as a col-
lection of agents interacting through simple rules. In particular, the building (or the lack) of
consensus in social systems has attracted much attention in recent years. A number of mod-
els have been considered in order to mimic the dynamics of consensus in opinion formation,
cultural dynamics, etc [6]. Among those models, Sznajd dynamics of opinion spreading has
been subject of a great deal of work in recent years. Sznajd model is duly based on the trade
union lema: ”united we stand, divided we fall”, and has been studied on diﬀerent network
topologies and for (slight) variations of the dynamics [6–11].

An important aspect of social and economic systems, recently discussed within opinion
formation models, has been the presence of some agents called contrarians– namely, people
who are in a ”nonconformist opposition”. That is, people who always adopt the opposite
opinion to the majority [12–14]. In stock markets for instance, contrarians are those investors
who buy shares of stock when most others are selling and sell when others are buying. The
existence of a high proportion of contrarians in a society may play an important rˆole in social
dynamics (think for instance of referendums or stock market dynamics) [12].

In an attempt to include the contrarian eﬀect in existing social models, a number of
previous studies have considered contrarian agents as a initial condition, i.e. a given density

of contrarians is introduced in the model by hand for instance [12–14]. This is somewhat
artiﬁcial and one would expect that simple models of opinion spreading should spontaneously
lead to the existence of a fraction of contrarians among the population as some sort of emergent
property.

In this Letter we show that a contrarian eﬀect can spontaneously emerge when stochastic
driving is included in the model. As a typical model example we introduce stochastic dynamics
on the Sznajd model. This randomness in the update of an agent opinion is meant to be
a highly simpliﬁed description of the interplay between fashion/propaganda and a collective
climate parameter, which is usually referred to as social temperature of the system [15–17]. We
show here that social temperature in Snajd-type models leads to the spontaneous appearance
of contrarian agents in the system.

Mean-ﬁeld approach. – Following the mean-ﬁeld approach in [8], we have considered the
Sznajd model (the so-called “two over one” case in [8]), where two agents are chosen randomly
and, if they are in consensus, then another randomly chosen agent is convinced by them. The
Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) for the probability P(m, t) of having a “magnetization” m, at
time t given a certain initial condition at time t0 < t is given by

where N is the total number of agents. The magnetization density m = (N + − N −)/N
measures the opinion state of the system and N +, N − are the number of agents supporting
the + or the − opinion, respectively (with N + + N − = N ).

We now include a social temperature eﬀect in the model by allowing the possibility that
at every time step an agent follows the rules of the Sznajd model with probability p (p ≤ 1),
while there is a probability 1−p that those rules are not fulﬁlled (an agent adopts the opposite
option than the one dictated by the rules). Then, for a given probability p, we arrive at a
FPE for Pp(m, t) that reads

The analysis of this stationary solution for varying p shows that there is a threshold value,
p = pc, such that for p > pc the system is bistable with a probability density P stat

by spontaneously selecting one of the stable solutions m±. On the contrary, for p < pc the
system becomes monostable and disordered with a magnetization density peaked at m = 0 in
which no dominant opinion survives. The threshold pc can be calculated in this mean-ﬁeld
approximation equating m+ = m−, at which all three extreme coalesce into a single minimum
at m = 0, so that we ﬁnd pc = 5/6. This behavior is shown in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1 – The eﬀective mean-ﬁeld potential obtained from Eq. (3). For large values of p two minima
m± appear. These move continuously toward each other as the threshold value pc = 5/6 is approached
indicating a continuous phase transition. Bottom: Position of the potential minima vs p. When both
extreme coalesce into m = 0, the transition point is reached. Top: Eﬀective potential for (from left
to right) p = 0.7, p = pc = 5/6, and p = 0.9.

The picture emerging from the mean-ﬁeld approach is clear. The eﬀect of including thermal
ﬂuctuations in Snajd type models immediately leads to a contrarian-like eﬀect. Some agents
randomly take decisions that oppose the rules of the model, indicating some undecidedness
in a fraction of the population. If such a fraction overcomes the critical threshold (1 − pc =
1/6 ≈ 0.1667) the system will reach a stalemate situation, analogous to the contrarians eﬀect
discussed in [12–14].

Monte Carlo simulations. –

In what follows we report on Monte Carlo simulations, in
order to test the above discussed mean-ﬁeld results. We have studied the model on regular
lattices and small-world networks (which in the limit of high rewiring probability should
reproduce the mean-ﬁeld results). To make such an analysis, and in order to avoid the spurious
antiferromagnetic solution of the Sznajd original model, we have studied a convenient variation
proposed in [18]:

• rule 1′: Chose an agent at random, say i, and if si × si+1 = 1, then si−1 and si+2 adopt

the direction of the selected pair [i, i + 1],

• rule 2′: if si × si+1 = −1, then si adopts the direction of si−1 and si+1 the direction of

si+2.

Following [18], in case of disagreement of the pair (si, si+1), the rule 2′ makes that the agent i
”feels more comfortable” since it ends up with at least one neighbor having his same opinion.
This variation of Sznajd model does not aﬀect the basic behaviour and indeed has been shown
to exhibit the same type of scaling features as the original model.

We now introduce a stochastic mechanism in the dynamics as follows. At each Monte
Carlo step we assume that, with a probability p, the rules are fully applied as indicated above,

Fig. 2 – Discontinuous phase transition for the one-dimensional lattice: the jump of the order param-
eter m from ±1 to zero occurs abruptly. The discontinuity is more evident for larger lattices. Top:
Stationary distribution of m for θ = 0.44, 0.46, and 0.6 (from left to right), and system size N = 512.
For small values of θ a local maximum starts to develop at m = 0 and becomes the global maximum
for θ > θ∗. Data were averaged over 5 × 103 independent realizations.

while the opposite option to the one dictated by the rules happens with a probability 1 − p.
The probability p, in analogy with Weidlich [1, 2] and Babinec [16], is deﬁned according to

p = Λ exp

α
θ i

,

h

(4)

where α is some ﬁxed parameter related to the strength of nearest neighbour interactions
(we assume α > 0), and θ is the collective climate parameter and plays the rˆole of a (social)
temperature. The normalization constant is Λ−1 = exp(α/θ) + exp(−α/θ).

The asymptotic behaviour of p is:

• if θ → 0, we have p → 1, indicating that without thermal ﬂuctuations we recover S´anchez

(and Sznajd) dynamics;

• if θ → ∞, we have p → 0.5, the probability of fulﬁlling the model rules or its opposite

are the same. The model has a complete random behavior.

Firstly we report on our results on the one-dimensional lattice. Each lattice site is occupied
by one agent with opinion (spin) si ∈ {+1, −1}. Starting from a random initial condition we let
the system evolve towards its stationary state. For θ = 0 a consensus state arises (m± = ±1).
However, as θ is increased we observe transition towards the stalemate state as predicted by
mean-ﬁeld theory, nonetheless the transition is discontinuous (ﬁrst order) as shown in Fig. 2.
In order to compare with the mean-ﬁeld results, we have studied our model in a fully
connected network, which is expected to behave as a mean-ﬁeld system. Indeed, in a fully
connected network we observe that the transition between order and stalemate state becomes
continuous. The qualitative agreement with mean-ﬁeld results is apparent in Fig. 3.

Fig. 3 – Stationary distribution of m for a fully-connected lattice of N = 512 agents. Data were
averaged over 100 independent runs. From left to right and top to bottom θ = 0.30, 2.30, 2.60, and
2.90. A second order transition towards a “stalemate” state is apparent: the most probably values of
the order parameter m changes continuously from m = ±1 (bistable) to m = 0 (monostable).

We have also studied the intermediate cases between one-dimensional and mean-ﬁeld (in-
ﬁnite dimensional) limits by analyzing the model on small-world networks. Starting from a
regular a one-dimensional lattice with periodic boundary conditions the links between neigh-
bours are rewired with a certain probability r to a random site. Even for small values of r
we observe a continuous phase transition from order to disorder as predicted by mean-ﬁeld
theory. We also observed that for increasing values of the rewiring probability r, the critical
temperature, θ∗, also increases, as shown in Fig.4.

The critical density of contrarians that it is required to reach the threshold (ρc ∼ 1−p(θ∗))
is relatively large (the mean-ﬁeld result ρc ∼ 0.33 in the case 2 against 2). However, such
values are reasonable baring in mind that such a density of contrarians corresponds to a
statistical average, dynamically generated by a large value of the social temperature (that
is, each agent could sustain, convince or change its opinion dynamically). This mechanism
is notably diﬀerent from setting a ﬁxed number or density ρc of agents in a “nonconformist
opposition” that will never follow the rules, as was done in previous studies [12–14]. In physical
terms this diﬀerence is similar to the distinction between annealed and quenched disorder.

Conclusions. – We have proposed a dynamical mechanism that leads to a contrarian-like
eﬀect analogous to the one described in [12]. However, in contrast to [12], we found that
contrarians may spontaneously emerge from the dynamics when social temperature eﬀects are
taken into account. For low temperatures the system gets to a consensus where a majority
opinion emerges just like in Sznajd type models. However, when temperature is above a critical
threshold the density of contrarians is (on average) then high enough to make impossible for
the system to reach a consensus and the opinion is equally divided between both options.

Here, we have considered diﬀerent forms and the most convenient prescriptions of the
Sznajd model for the analytical and the numerical analysis. However, we have checked that
the phenomenon is robust and does not depend on the particular form of the model. Moreover,
since the Sznajd model (as well as many other two state opinion formation models) is similar
to Ising type model [19] up to a certain extend, we can regard our results as a sophisticated
manifestation in social systems of the ferromagnetic transition in spin systems.

To conclude, the possibility of some external stochastic and/or deterministic inﬂuence on
the agents of an opinion formation model, particularly regarding the possibility of some form
of stochastic resonance [20], was recently analyzed by several authors [16, 17]. It would be
of great interest to study such an stochastic resonance eﬀect (particularly its dependence on
the size of the system [17]) in our model. This can actualy be done by including a fashion
external ﬁeld (for instance a periodic signal) combined with the noise eﬀect coming from the
social temperature. This is the subject of a forthcoming work.

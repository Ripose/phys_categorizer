The agent-based model of price dynamics on a directed evolving complex network is
suggested and studied by direct simulation. The resulting stationary regime is maintained
as a result of the balance between the extremal dynamics, adaptivity of strategic variables
and reconnection rules. For some properly selected parametric combination the network
displays small-world phenomenon with high mean clustering coeﬃcient and power-law
node degree distribution. The mechanism of repeated random walk through network
combined with a ﬁtness recognition is proposed and tested to generate modular multi-
leader market. The simulations suggest that dynamics of ﬁtness is the slowest process
that manifests itself in the volatility clustering of the log-price returns.

Keywords: econophysics, complex networks, agent-based model

1. Introduction

The design of the decentralized systems of autonomous interacting agents with
abilities to automatically devise societies so as to form modules that accommodate
their behavior via social and economic norms in emergent ways is highly challenging.
Agents in such groups plan and act so as to increase their own utility.

As a general theoretical framework for starting statistical considerations of in-
teracting agent entities we take into account the Ising model. Being made simply by
binary spin variables, the model is able to reproduce diﬀerent complex phenomena
in diﬀerent areas of science like biology 1, sociology 2 economy 3,4,5 or informatics 6.
Looked at from the perspective of the economics this example has a great impor-
tance because it demonstrates that a basic interaction between the spins (agents)
can bring non-trivial collective phenomena. The parallels between ﬂuctuations in
the economic and magnetic systems aﬀord an application of spin models to the mar-
ket statistics 7,8,9. The attempts 10,11,12,13 examine a context with the minority

game theory 14. Basic terms borrowed from the magnetic systems have been built
in to the spin concept: exchange interaction between spins and interaction with
random ﬁeld. The approaches based on the minority game assume competition of
the short-range ferromagnetic and global antiferromagnetic terms that may shed
light on the emergence of bubbles and crashes. The justiﬁcation for our present
formulation comes from 15. It assumes that each among i = 1, 2, . . . , L interacting
traders (agents) owns her/his regular lattice site position i and a corresponding spin
variable S(t)(i) ∈ {−1, 1}, where the upper index (t) labels the market time. Each
agent, has an attitude to place buy orders described by S(t)(i) = 1, or to place sell
orders which is described by an S(t)(i) = −1. The variable S(t)(i) is updated by an
asynchronous stochastic heat-bath dynamics expressed in terms of the local eﬀec-
tive ﬁeld. One of the important collective contributions is described by the absolute
value of instant magnetization

m(t) =

S(t)(i)

expresses relative size of groups of buyers or sellers. The predominance of buy
orders manifests itself throughout m(t) > 0. The condition implies that instant
price p(t) overshoots certain fundamental value, whereas m(t) < 0 corresponds to
under-valued stock. Quantitatively, the logarithmic price return

ln hp(t+1)/p(t)

i = λ( m(t+1) − m(t) )

is related to magnetization diﬀerences m(t+1) − m(t); λ is constant parameter.

Our recent approach to spin market models 16 has been formulated for net-
work geometry. The attempt is roughly analogous to structurally dynamic cellular
automata 17 in which the conventional cellular-automata rules are generalized to
formalism where geometry and matter are dynamically coupled. However, our for-
mulation did not give satisfactory topological results. This article has the objective
to propose an alternative formulation helping strengthen the elements of realism.
Among the main achievements are the following: (1) the alternative protocol of net-
work reconnection based on incomplete (local) information of agents that adapt to
one of sub-leaders; (2) the shift to ”small world” and realistic network properties;
(3) the development of the small-scale intranet concept on the level of individual
agent’s ”mind” combining technical and planning tools, indicators, models, etc..

The plan of the paper is as it follows. In the next section 2 we discuss the basic
network properties. The overall dynamics are given in section 3. A more detailed
deﬁnition of model items appears in subsections 3.1.1-3.5. In section 4 we present
statistical characteristics extracted from simulation.

2. The network topology

Suppose that the market structure is determined by the underlying complex net-
work deﬁned by dynamical rules for links between buyers and sellers. Consider the

directed network (graph) of labeled nodes Γ = {1, 2, . . . , L}, where node i ∈ Γ at-
taches via Nout directed links to its neighbors Xn(i) ∈ Γ, n ∈ Iout ≡ {1, 2, . . . , Nout},
i.e. the graph is Nout-regular. Two outgoing links X1(i) = 1 + imodL, X2(i) =
1 + (L + i − 2)modL of node i ∈ Γ create the bidirectional cycle static sub-
graph (L-gon). The reconnection rules are applied exceptionally to the links X (t)
n (i),
3 ≤ n ≤ Nout. The using of static module (n = 1, 2) provides guarantees for the
preservation of connectedness at any stage t.

3.1. Decision making via local ﬁeld

and intranet

Uss, interface between extranet
b

To imitate the market patterns it is desirable to enter spins as fastest degrees of
freedom. For directed network topology the spin degree is inferior to the modiﬁed
local ﬁeld

hLS(i) ←

Σn∈Iout S(Xn(i)) + κ(i)m + h0(i) .

(8)

Jext(i)
Nout

The links are mediators of the couplings Jext(i) through which agent i keeps
the game-relevant information. By the weighted connections the agent reacts to
the information about the sell-buy orders of the linked neighbors. The ferromag-
netic coupling Jext(i) > 0 causes that spin agent S(i) behaves as a buyer when
ΣNout
n=1 S(Xn(i)) > 0, and vice versa. The antiferromagnetic coupling Jext(i) < 0 acts
in the opposite way. The random ﬁeld term h0(i) is interpreted as the agent’s eﬀort
to preserve current decision sell, buy or stay inactive (if h0 ≃ 0). When h0(i) dom-
inates, it weakens the inﬂuence of environment. The instant mean-ﬁeld like term
κ(i) m describes the agent’s response to the price from the previous iteration step.
Clearly, if κ(i) dominates within a ΠJ , it synchronizes the spin orders.

3.1.1. The small-scale intranet

The intra-agent idiosyncratic structure is modeled in a abstract way that resembles
in part the routing control unit 6. The methodology we have developed strug-
gle beyond the elementary limits of single-spin intra-agent description. Here the
enriched structure is considered: the inherent agent’s states and properties are en-
coded by Ising spins (neurons) coupled by weighted links of fully interconnected
intranet. For concreteness, we shall suppose the agent’s i architecture with Nintr
spins {s(i, k)}Nintr
k=1 , s(i, k) ∈ {−1, 1}. Thus, from now on, we strictly distinguish
between s(·, ·) and S(·) symbols. The eﬀective local ﬁeld hss(i, k) is considered as

the superposition of the large-scale [inter-agent hLS(i)] and small-scale (intranet)
contributions

where hstoch(i, k) is the Gaussian stochastic variable (i.e. the source of local muta-
tions) and Jintr(i, k, q) with indices k, q = 1, 2, . . ., Nintr is the Nintr × Nintr system
of the intra-agent pair couplings (weights); the term 1/(Nintr − 1) is included for
normalization reasons.

The update is performed asynchronously. The state of kth unit of agent i is

recalculated according

Two-neuron output of intranet has been considered: k = 1, 2, [Nintr > 1, see Eq.(9)].
For given topology we deﬁne the agent’s sell (buy, passive) order

s(i, k) ← sign (hss(i, k)) .

S(i) ←

[s(i, 1) + s(i, 2)] ,

where 1/2 normalizes the state space {−1, 0, 1} of individual spin S(i). The double
degenerated state S = 0 is interpreted as a passive state 13.

3.2. Fitness F (i) concept

As it is mentioned earlier [see Eq.(7)], the principles governing co-evolution enter
through the local ﬁtness (alternatively score, popularity) that expresses an abil-
ity/inability to survive or death in the competitive environment. The biological
species interact with each other in ways which either increase or decrease the ﬁt-
ness of species. In the same way, the economic agents push their strategies. The
ﬁtness concept is so ﬂexible that it can be tailored to many speciﬁc circumstances,
including those stated in economic literature. The selection and survival accord-
ing ﬁtness has been used for spin market models 10. Another source of inspiration
was raised from the topic of ﬁtness-dependent link formation mechanism of net-
works 18,?,20. In its present form of model, the local ﬁtness is deﬁned in an indirect
manner as the integral over the history of agent’s gains and losses caused by sell-buy
orders

F (t+1)(i) = F (t)(i) − S(t)(i) m(t) .

3.3. Adaptivity procedure

UAd(ia)
b

Many models of human behavior in the social sciences assume that humans can be
reasonably approximated or described as ”rational” entities. However, the most peo-
ple are only partly rational, and are in fact emotional/irrational in their decisions.
This limitation expresses the bounded rationality 21 of agents.

Models incorporating intrinsically adaptivity-like features assumes the presence
of followers with their believe that imitation of given strategy owned by their neigh-
bors (selected with care according ﬁtness) would bring a future beneﬁt to them.
The adaptivity procedure assumes the transfer of information on popular (success-
ful) ΠJ along the adjacent edges of the local network. The adaption of ia starts with
the random pick of na ∈ Iout that checks a prototype node iprot = Xna (ia) among
the nearest neighbors. The elementary act of adaption to prototype is described by
updates

Jext(ia) ← Jext(ia)(1 − η) + ηJext(iprot) ,

(13)

Jintr(ia, k, q) ← Jintr(ia, k, q)(1 − η) + ηJintr(iprot, k, q) ,

κ(ia) ← κ(ia)(1 − η) + ηκ(iprot) ,
h0(ia) ← h0(ia)(1 − η) + ηh0(iprot) ,

where plasticity parameter η ∈ (0, 1) expresses how quickly the follower ia learns
strategy of prototype node iprot. Ideally, the exceptional repeated application of
UAd(ia) leads to the market with uniﬁed strategy for all nodes.

3.4. Reconnection rules

URe(ir, iB), network dynamics
b

Recently, the interest in complex networks has been extended to the search for the
local rules governing the dynamics of social and technological networks. Several
principles have been exploited for the purpose. As an example we mention the net-
work that shows marks of age 22 or inter-agent communication across the net 23,24.
The core of the most of methodologies is grounded on that particular mechanism
of preferential attachment by Barab´asi and Albert 25. An important distinction
from mentioned approach is that in the present model we ensure the stationarity
conditions and constant number of nodes L.

Let us turn attention to our former proposal of single leader model 16. It is
intuitively implausible, that the adaption of L − 1 followers to a single leader can
hold in the limit of very large L. The reason for the revision of single leader picture
is that the larger the market is, a more demanding is the (technical) market analysis
of individual agent to localize the current leader oﬀering the global strategy. Ac-
cordingly, we are interested in a more general multi-leader stationary regime where
group of leaders is distributed throughout net.

Here, we test the indirect method for generation of architecture which includes
many temporal leaders obtained by the mechanism of ”snooping” of strategies. The
basic idea was to use random walk on the net 37,38. In our variant we assume that

strategic information gathered by walker (the assistant of agent ir) visiting nodes
is partially local. We imagine an agent - surfer on the Web reading pages, jumping
from one to another by clicking randomly on a link. By this way visited nodes form a
group of similar pages linked together. Intuitively, to anchor exceptionality of node
ir we suggest the trial walks of length Npath that are Nrep times repeated from the
actual origin ir, i.e. from the node occupied by agent ir seeking for a best ﬁtness
around the whole bunch of surrounding paths.

The preferential attachments to sub-leader ﬁnally yield segmented market (i.e.
market in which there are impediments to the free ﬂow of information). The re-
connection
URe(ir, iB) consists of the composition of the procedures of edge dis-
UReW and subsequent connection

4. Simulation results

4.1. Selection of parameters

The simulation as presented in the next subsection, has 13-dimension parameter
space. The selection of relevant combination within the parametric space is non-
trivial task that would be theme of our future work. To attain at least qualitative
agreement with widely accepted economic concepts 29, the appropriate values (see
Table 1) have been inferred from parameter sweeps, extensive simulation and opti-

mization attempts. The particular requirement has been to keep the spin dynamics
much faster than adaptivity that should be more frequent than reconnections. An
additional constraint aims at attaining of the vicinity of a critical phase, where the
power-law dependences are generated 18.

4.2. Important distributions and averages

The statistics for calculation of averages has been collected from 3 × 107 Monte
Carlo steps per node.

The statistical treatment of simulation data (see Fig.1) leads to the fat tailed
probability density function (pdf) that have been ﬁtted properly by the stretched
exponential dependence pdf(x) ≃ exp
, q ≃ 1 of the log-price
returns 30. The comparison with the returns obtained for indexes NASDAQ, DJIA
and S&P500 is quite amazing.

The distribution of ﬁtness is plotted in Fig.2. The plot indicates the principal
diﬀerences between positive and negative branches of pdf(F ). The leadership di-
vided among many leaders gives rise to exponential distribution for F > 0. This
contrasts with consequences of extremal dynamics, where elimination of the strategy
of unique ”economically weakest” agent produces the power-law branch of pdf(F ).
The numerical simulations have conﬁrmed the power-law for extinction events (see
Fig.2b and deﬁnition in caption). Viewed in the light of reasoning 31, our present
result has many features in common with the empirical power-laws which are similar
for both biological species 18 and ﬁrms (agents) in the economy.

Now we turn attention to the issues of network statistics depicted in Fig.3 and
Fig.4. The node degree k(in)(j) =
Pi∈Γ Pn∈Iout δj,Xn(i) accounts for incoming links
of node j. The stationary regime represents the source of the sequence of networks
with broad-scale pdf of the node degrees. By ﬁtting of pdf(k(in)) we have identiﬁed
two partial eﬀective exponents γin ≃ −1.23 (for k(in) ≥ 20), and −1.82 (as k(in) ≤
20) from the law pdf(kin) ∼ [k(in)]γin
. Several real exponents are provided here for
some illustrative purposes only. The value 1.81 32 corresponds to the collection of
e-mal addresses. The exponent −1.2 belongs to the coauthorship network 33.

The useful information on network provides clustering coeﬃcient C(i) 34 that
is a local measure of interrelatedness of an object’s neighbors. The current ob-
ject of interest is the statistical mean hCi. The larger coeﬃcient expresses rein-
forced social transitivity 35. For directed network we used the formula C(i) =
δXn1 (Xn2 (i)),Xn3 (i) stands for
e(i)/(Nout(1 − Nout)), where e(i) ≡
the number of the links between neighbors Xn1(Xn2 (i)) and Xn3(i) attained from
i. The denominator Nout(1 − Nout) of C(i) is the maximum number of links. As
usual, it is meaningful to compare the mean clustering coeﬃcients of two distinct
network reconnection modes. For the network with randomly attached nodes (only
the links n ≥ 3 are randomized) we obtained hCrandi ≃ 0.02, while hCi ≃ 0.51 and
thus hCi/hCrandi ≃ 25.5.

of links (i, j); path } between nodes i, j ∈ Γ we have computed its average for par-
tially random net hlmin,randi ≃ 2.9 (with the circular subgraph). In contrast, the
action of
URe(ir, iB) provides hlmini ≃ 16. The combination of identiﬁed network
attributes, indicates what has come to be known as small-world behavior. Addition-
b
ally, this is to our knowledge, the ﬁrst model that generates the power-law pdf of
lmin. It could be explained as an eﬀect of the repeated random walk on the prefer-
ential attachment. More simulations are needed, however, to identify the reason of
the power-law.

In Fig.5 the temporal aspects of the market are highlighted by the autocorrela-
tion functions. Interestingly, the dynamics of the signs recorded of price orders is
identiﬁed that is the subject of empirical study 36. The clustering of the volatility of
the log-price returns is observed. The long-time scale (∼ 104 MC steps) corresponds
to very slow ﬁtness changes.

5. Conclusions

In this paper we describe a modeling framework aimed at uniﬁed view on stock price
dynamics and its relation to the complex market network. The stationary regime has
been investigated that is formed due to balance between information entropy inﬂow
produced by the extremal dynamics and other stochastic sources compensated by
the entropy outﬂow caused by adaptive moves.

The emergent aspects of simulated agent systems near the criticality can be

summarized as it follows

• the power-law distributions of the topological and temporal characteristics
as a consequence of self-organization processes in the vicinity of a critical
regime. The necessary remark in this context is that exponents of such
dependences are non-universal, i.e. they can vary from one parametrization
to another.

• the modular structures are acquired due to combined eﬀect of repeated

random walk and reconnection.

The adjustment of proper parameters is somewhat delicate problem that can be
formulated as multi-objective optimization computationally demanding task. Due
to its comprehensive nature, the problem is planned to be discussed in our future
work.

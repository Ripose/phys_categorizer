Abstract. One of the principal statistical features characterizing the activity in ﬁnancial markets is the
distribution of ﬂuctuations in market indicators such as the index. While the developed stock markets such
as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) have been found to show heavy-tailed ﬂuctuation distribution,
there have been claims that emerging markets behave diﬀerently. Here we investigate the distribution of
several indices from the Indian ﬁnancial market, one of the largest emerging markets in the world. We have
used both tick-by-tick data from the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and daily closing data from both NSE
and Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). We ﬁnd that the cumulative distribution of index ﬂuctuations has long
tails consistent with a power law having exponent α ≈ 3, independent of the time-scale of observation or
the market index used for the analysis. This “inverse cubic law” is quantitatively similar to what has been
observed in developed markets, thereby providing strong evidence that, at least in terms of ﬂuctuations,
these markets behave similarly.

that the nature of the distribution is invariant with re-
spect to diﬀerent market indices, as well as the time-scale
of observation. Taken together with our previous work on
the distribution of individual stock price ﬂuctuations in
Indian markets [6], this strongly argues in favor of the
universality of the nature of ﬂuctuation distribution, re-
gardless of the stage of development of the market or the
economy underlying it.

1 Introduction

Physicists are being attracted in increasing numbers to the
study of ﬁnancial markets by the prospect of discovering
universalities in their statistical properties [1,2]. This has
partly been driven by the availability of large amounts of
electronically recorded data with very high temporal res-
olution, making it possible to study various indicators of
market activity. Among the various candidates for market-
invariant features, the most widely studied are the distri-
bution of ﬂuctuations in overall market indicators such as
market indices, as well as ﬂuctuations in individual stock
prices. There is now consensus that the cumulative distri-
bution of price ﬂuctuations in developed markets exhibit
long tails consistent with power-law decay having expo-
nent close to 3 [3,4]. Similar behavior has also been re-
ported for market index ﬂuctuations [5], although there
seems to be some controversy regarding its universality.
However, for emerging markets there has been no agree-
ment on the nature of the ﬂuctuation distribution, with
several studies claiming the distribution to have qualita-
tively diﬀerent natures. At stake is the issue of whether
the ﬂuctuation distribution can be truly considered an uni-
versal (i.e., market-independent) feature. In this paper we
show that the Indian ﬁnancial market, one of the largest
emerging markets in the world, has index ﬂuctuations sim-
ilar to that seen for developed markets. Further, we ﬁnd

Market indices, rather than individual stock prices,
have been the focus of most previous studies as the former
is more easily available, and also gives overall information
about the market. By contrast, individual stocks are sus-
ceptible to sector-speciﬁc inﬂuences and may not be repre-
sentative of the entire market, the latter being more likely
to exhibit invariant features. Indeed, ﬁnancial markets can
be viewed as a system of large number of interacting com-
ponents that are subject to external information shocks.
The importance of interactions relative to external in-
formation in governing market behavior has emerged only
in recent times. The earliest theories of market activity,
e.g., Bachelier’s random walk model [7], assumed that
ﬂuctuations are the result of several independent external
shocks, and therefore, predicted the resulting distribution
to be Gaussian. While this is indeed seen to be true at
long time scales, at shorter times the data shows much
larger ﬂuctuations than would be expected from a Gaus-
sian distribution. The deviation from Gaussian nature was
also seen for commodity price ﬂuctuations, e.g., in Man-
delbrot’s analysis of cotton price [8] which was found to

follow a Levy-stable distribution. However, this contra-
dicted the observation that, in longer time scales, the dis-
tribution converged to a Gaussian. This was resolved by
proposing the truncated Levy distribution, which has ex-
ponentially decaying tails, for the ﬂuctuations of, e.g., the
S&P 500 index [9]. However, subsequently it was shown
that the tails of the cumulative distribution for this index
actually follow a power law,

Pc(x) > x−α,

(1)

with the exponent α ≈ 3 (the “inverse cubic law”) [10],
well outside the stable Levy regime 0 < α < 2. This is
consistent with the fact that for longer time scales the
distribution converges to a Gaussian. Similar behavior has
been reported for the Nikkei and Hang-Seng indices [4].

However, there is some controversy about the univer-
sality of the power-law nature for the tails of the index
ﬂuctuations distribution, even when only developed mar-
kets are being considered. For example, other studies of
the Hang Seng and Nikkei indices claim exponential distri-
bution for their respective ﬂuctuations [11,12]. Again, for
the All Ordinaries index of the Australian stock market,
the negative tail has been reported to follow the inverse
cubic law while the positive tail is closer to Gaussian [13].
For developing economies, there have been several claims
that emergent markets have ﬂuctuation distribution that
is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from developed markets. For ex-
ample, a recent study contrasting the behavior of indices
from seven developed markets with the KOSPI index of
the Korean stock market found that while the former ex-
hibit the inverse cubic law, the latter follows an exponen-
tial distribution [14]. On the other hand, the IBOVESPA
index of the Sao Paulo stock market has been claimed
to follow a truncated Levy distribution [15,16]. However,
there have also been reports of the inverse cubic law for
emerging markets, e.g., for the Mexican stock market in-
dex IPC [17] and the WIG20 index of the Polish stock
market [18].

India has claimed that the corresponding ﬂuctuation dis-
tribution is exponentially decaying at the tails [19]. How-
ever, a more detailed study over a larger data set has es-
tablished the inverse cubic law for individual stock prices
[6]. On the other hand, to get a sense of the nature of
ﬂuctuations for the entire market, one needs to look at
the corresponding distribution for the market index. While
Sarma [20] has reported a heavy-tailed distribution for the
Nifty index of NSE, it shows a signiﬁcant deviation from
the inverse cubic law. In this paper, we report analysis
of data for this index along with a few others, that fully
characterizes the Indian market, to conclusively establish
the nature of the ﬂuctuation distribution.

The Indian market data is of unique importance in de-
ciding whether emerging markets behave diﬀerently from
developed markets, as it is one of the fastest growing ﬁ-
nancial markets in the world. We focus on the two largest
stock exchanges in India, the NSE and the Bombay Stock
Exchange (BSE). NSE is not only the most active amongst
the more than 20 stock exchanges in India, but also the
third largest in the world in terms of transactions [21]. It
started operations in the equities segment from November
1994, and thus we have the opportunity to study the be-
havior of the market for the entire period of its existence.
Over this period, the NSE has grown by several orders of
magnitude (Fig. 1) demonstrating its emerging character.
In contrast to NSE, BSE is the oldest stock exchange in
Asia. Until the creation of NSE, it used to be the largest
in India; however, over the past decade its share of the
Indian ﬁnancial market has fallen signiﬁcantly. Therefore,
we contrast two markets which have evolved very diﬀer-
ently in the period under study. Note that, the early 1990s
also marks the beginning of economic liberalization in In-
dia, allowing us to study the subsequently fast evolving
market right from its onset.

indicators of the Indian market. It is composed of the top
50 highly liquid stocks which make up more than half of
the market capitalisation in India. It is computed using
market capitalisation weighted method, with the level of
the index reﬂecting the total market value of all stocks
in the index relative to a particular base period. We have
used (i) high frequency data from Jan 2003 - Mar 2004,
where the market index is recorded every time a trade
takes place for an index component. The total number of
records in this database is about 6.8 × 107. We have also
looked at data over much longer periods by considering
the daily closing values of (ii) Nifty index for the 16-year
period Jul 1990 - May 2006, (iii) Sensex index of BSE for
the 15-year period Jan 1991 - May 2006, and (iv) BSE 500
index for the 7-year period Feb 1999 - May 2006. Sensex is
calculated using the same method as the NSE Nifty, using
30 stocks representing a sample of large, well-established
and ﬁnancially sound companies in BSE. The BSE 500
index uses 500 stocks representing all 20 major sectors of
the economy. It represents almost the entire market as its
component stocks comprise nearly 93% of the total market
capitalisation in BSE.

3 Distribution of Index Returns

We ﬁrst report the analysis of the high-frequency data for
the NSE Nifty index, which we sampled at 1-min intervals
to generate the time series I(t). To measure the index ﬂuc-
tuations such that the result is independent of the scale of
measurement, we calculate the logarithmic return, which
is deﬁned as,

R(t, ∆t) ≡ ln I(t + ∆t) − ln I(t),

(2)

where ∆t is the time-scale over which the ﬂuctuation is ob-
served. To be able to compare between ﬂuctuation distri-
butions calculated using diﬀerent time intervals, for which

the width of the distribution may vary, we deﬁne the nor-
malized return as,

r(t, ∆t) ≡

R − hRi
σ

,

(3)

where σ2 ≡ hR2i − hRi2 is the volatility and h· · ·i denotes
the time average over the given time period.

Fig. 2 shows the cumulative distribution of the nor-
malized return for ∆t = 1 min. This has an asymptotic
power law behaviour with the exponents for the positive
and the negative tails estimated as

α =

(cid:26)

2.98 ± 0.06 (positive tail)
3.18 ± 0.12 (negative tail).

(4)

Note that, for calculating the return distribution for ∆t < 1
day, we have removed the return corresponding to the
overnight change in the index value, to avoid artifacts of
the data measurement process. We also perform an alter-
native estimation of the tail index of the the above distri-
bution by using the Hill-estimator [22] and found α ≃ 3.10
and 2.94 for the positive and the negative tails, respec-
tively.

Next, we extend our analysis for larger ∆t. Again, we
ﬁnd the distribution to be consistent with a power law tail
behaviour upto ∆t = 1 day with exponent α ≈ 3 (Fig. 3).
For time scales longer than 1 day, the distribution slowly
converges to Gaussian behavior. The results are invariant
with respect to whether one calculates return using the
sampled index value at the end point of an interval or the
average index value over the interval.

The return distribution of the daily closing data of
Nifty over a much longer period also shows qualitatively
similar behavior, as does the Sensex and BSE500 indices
which are from another stock exchange (Fig. 4). The mea-
sured exponent values (Table 1) are all close to 3. This
underlines the invariance of the nature of market ﬂuctua-
tions with respect to time of measurement, interval used
and diﬀerent exchanges.

Normalized returns

NSE had begun operation and rapidly increased in terms
of activity, the BSE had existed for a long time prior to
this period and showed a signiﬁcant decrease in market
share. However, both showed very similar ﬂuctuation be-
havior. This indicates that the distribution of returns is
invariant with respect to markets. The fact that the dis-
tribution is quantitatively same as developed markets, im-
ply that it is also independent of the state of the economy.
Therefore, our results indicate that although markets may
diﬀer from each other in terms of (i) the details of their
components, (ii) the nature of interactions and (iii) their
susceptibility to news from outside the market, the obser-
vation of invariant properties indicate that an universal
principle is responsible for generating market ﬂuctuations.

4 Discussion and Conclusion

Our observation of the inverse-cubic law in Indian mar-
kets may elicit the question of why some other studies
have seen signiﬁcant deviation of the index return distri-
bution from the power law form. This is possibly due to
limited data sets, as most of these studies were for daily
closing data over relatively short periods. The relatively
low number of data points corresponding to returns of
large magnitude can lead to missing out the long tail. In
fact, even for individual stocks in developed markets, al-
though the tails follow a power law, the bulk of the return
distribution is exponential [23]. Therefore, looking at data
over shorter periods can result in misidentiﬁcation of the
nature of the distribution. We observe this in the rela-
tively large deviation of α from 3 for the BSE 500 index
which is the smallest data set we have studied.

If the individual stocks follow the inverse cubic law,
it would be reasonable to suppose that the index, which
is a weighted average of several stocks, would also behave
similarly provided the diﬀerent stocks move in a correlated
fashion [4]. If larger number of stocks are used to construct
an index, the degree of correlation amongst them may
weaken. So, another reason for the observed departure of
the BSE 500 data from the inverse cubic law could be
because of its larger set of constituents.

On the whole, our study points out the remarkable ro-
bustness of the nature of the ﬂuctuation distribution for
market indices. While, in the period under our study, the

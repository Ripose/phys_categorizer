We study the temporal ﬂuctuations in time–dependent stock prices (both individual and compos-
ite) as a stochastic phenomenon using general techniques and methods of nonequilibrium statistical
mechanics. In particular, we analyze stock price ﬂuctuations as a non–Markovian stochastic process
using the ﬁrst–passage statistical concepts of persistence and survival. We report the results of
empirical measurements of the normalized q-order correlation functions fq(t), survival probability
S(t), and persistence probability P (t) for several stock market dynamical sets. We analyze both
minute–to–minute and higher frequency stock market recordings (i.e., with the sampling time δt of
the order of days). We ﬁnd that the ﬂuctuating stock price is multifractal and the choice of δt has no
eﬀect on the qualitative multifractal behavior displayed by the 1/q–dependence of the generalized
Hurst exponent Hq associated with the power–law evolution of the correlation function fq(t) ∼ tHq .
The probability S(t) of the stock price remaining above the average up to time t is very sensitive
to the total measurement time tm and the sampling time. The probability P (t) of the stock not
−θ,
returning to the initial value within an interval t has a universal power–law behavior, P (t) ∼ t
with a persistence exponent θ close to 0.5 that agrees with the prediction θ = 1 − H2. The em-
pirical ﬁnancial stocks also present an interesting feature found in turbulent ﬂuids, the extended
self–similarity.

INTRODUCTION

The ﬁnancial stocks are complex, nonlinear, open sys-
tems characterized by a large number of parameters.
Among other features, they present a multifractal be-
havior [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Whether or not the multi-
fractality is intrinsic or apparent is still an open ques-
tion [8]. An important step toward a better understand-
ing of such intricate dynamical processes is to search for
new methods that are able to provide information about
their temporal evolution. One way to explore the tem-
poral evolution of a stochastic system such as a ﬂuctu-
ating stock price, denoted by x(t), is by measuring the
persistence probability, P (t). That is the probability of
the stochastic variable x(t) not reaching its original value
corresponding to the starting time t0 up to a later time
t0 + t. This concept, closely related to the ﬁrst–passage
probability, has been successfully implemented in surface
growth phenomena [9, 10] and has been used to deter-
mine the universality class and the nonlinear features of
the underlying dynamical process through the exponent
θ associated with the power–law decay P (t) ∼ t−θ of
the persistence probability at large times. Alternatively,
one is interested in measuring the survival probability
S(t) which is deﬁned as the probability of the stock price
remaining above a reference value up to time t. In con-
trast with the persistence probability, we show that the
survival probability depends independently on both the
total measurement time tm and the time between succes-
sive recordings, i.e., the sampling time δt. The concepts
of persistence and ﬁrst–passage time have been recently
introduced in econophysics [11, 12]. Despite the capacity
of ﬁrst–passage statistical tools to predict the degree of
performance of a given stock (i.e., how long a stock re-

mains above a certain value, what is the ﬁrst time when it
reaches a particular level), it is quite intriguing that their
use in understanding the evolution of ﬁnancial markets
is rather scarce. Our study emphasizes the potential of
the survival and persistence probabilities in any time se-
ries investigations and shows how these concepts can be
connected to the traditional analysis [13] based on the
time evolution of price–price correlation functions. We
also point out the extended self–similar behavior mani-
fested by the stock price correlation functions. Extended
self–similarity was originally observed in ﬂuid turbulence
problems [14, 15] and subsequently in discrete stochastic
surface growth models [16]. Therefore we combine fea-
tures from very diﬀerent ﬁelds, such as surface growth,
econophysics of stock markets, and ﬂuid dynamics in an
eﬀort towards understanding the temporal evolution of
ﬁnancial stocks.

Our statistical study of stock market temporal ﬂuctu-
ations is motivated primarily by the availability of the
huge amount of quantitative data on the stock market
prices both for individual stocks as well as for aggre-
gate stock indices and both for instantaneous minute–
to–minute price ﬂuctuations as well as large–scale ﬂuctu-
ations over several years. Such detailed and precise quan-
titative information about the time dependence of a far–
from–equilibrium stochastic process is not easy to ﬁnd
in real physical systems. For example, temporal thermal
ﬂuctuations of steps on solid surfaces, which we have re-
cently analyzed [17, 18, 19] to study the persistence and
survival properties of equilibrium step ﬂuctuations, usu-
ally provide reliable time dependent data only over a cou-
ple of decades. Similarly, experimental studies [20] of ki-
netic surface roughening in interface growth, which have
served as model problems for developing the concepts

of dynamical scaling in nonequilibrium growth phenom-
ena, usually have reliable data for a couple of decades in
growth time. The availability of extensive quantitative
information on stock prices, including minute–to–minute
price ﬂuctuations within a single day as well as prices
spanning over years (or even decades for some stocks and
index averages), therefore provides an almost unique op-
portunity to statistically analyze a time–dependent non–
Markovian stochastic phenomenon using actual “experi-
mental” data covering many decades in time, in contract
to the corresponding experimental studies of real physical
systems which span only a few decades in time. It should
consequently be possible to obtain deﬁnitive information
about the persistence and survival behavior of stock price
ﬂuctuations studied as a non–Markovian stochastic phe-
nomenon. The availability of extensive stock price data
should also allow for a detailed multifractal analysis of
stock price ﬂuctuations, which could serve, in principle,
as a quantitative measure of “volatility” in the stock mar-
ket since multifractality is directly related to intermit-
tency and intermittency arises from the ﬁnite probability
for very large scale ﬂuctuations.

Our work presented in this article should therefore be
thought of as a detailed empirical “experimental” anal-
ysis of a non–Markovian dynamical stochastic process,
namely the stock market, from the speciﬁc perspectives
of ﬁrst–passage statistics (i.e., persistence and survival
probabilities and exponents) and intermittency (i.e., mul-
tifractality and volatility). Our motivation for studying
this speciﬁc problem is the existence of huge amount of
experimental data (i.e., stock prices) of very wide dy-
namical range. The fact that there is widespread current
interest in the statistical physics community in the sub-
ject of “econophysics”, which is nothing but the study
of economics using the principles and methodologies of
statistical mechanics, gives our current work some broad
context, but our own interest is, however, complementary
– we are using the vast amount of available dynamical
data on stock price ﬂuctuations to carry out an “exper-
imental” study of the important ﬁrst–passage statistical
concepts of persistence and survival in non–Markovian
in some
stochastic phenomena. The current work is,
sense, a continuation of our earlier work on understand-
ing various stochastic phenomena (i.e. thermal step ﬂuc-
tuations [17, 18, 19] and nonequilibrium surface growth
[10]) from the ﬁrst–passage statistics perspective – here
the stochastic process under consideration being an eco-
nomic phenomenon (i.e. stock price ﬂuctuations) rather
than physical phenomena as in the past.

Our study of the multifractal character of price ﬂuc-
tuations is based on a multifractal version [21] of the
traditional detrended ﬂuctuation analysis [22]. We also
use a standard dynamical scaling analysis, inspired from
surface growth phenomena, to show the multifractal be-
havior of the ﬁnancial stocks, quantitatively extracted
from the q–order price–price correlation functions. Our
results go in parallel with earlier analyses of other groups
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] which succeeded in showing multifrac-

2

tality in several stock markets and commodities. On the
other hand we investigate the persistence of price ﬂuctua-
tions described by the persistence exponent θ. The bridge
between these two analyses is provided by the second or-
der Hurst exponent H2 associated with the correlation
function of the stock price, which has been shown [9, 10]
to be simply related to the persistence exponent through
H2 = 1 − θ.
In this study we verify that this simple
relation is satisﬁed by both low and high frequency ﬂuc-
tuating ﬁnancial stocks.

The data we use for our stochastic study comprise the
daily Intel (INTC) stock value between January 1990
and December 2002 and the composite NYSE index (i.e.,
NYA index) between January 1966 and December 2002.
This corresponds to 3355 and 9312 data points, respec-
tively. We also analyze sets of data recorded every minute
for the Johnson and Johnson stock (JJ 2000) and ev-
ery ﬁve minutes for the Intel stock (INTC 2000) dur-
ing the year of 2000 [23]. This corresponds to 98280
and 19656 data points, respectively. The daily recorded
stocks have an obvious exponential increase of their prices
over several years. Therefore the exponential drift of the
background can be subtracted from the stock price and
we deﬁne a new stochastic variable ˜x(t) = x(t) − xb(t),
where the stochastic variable xb(t) associated with the
evolution of the background depends on two parameters
a and b, xb(t) = a exp(bt) [24]. We analyze the per-
sistence probability of both x(t) and ˜x(t). Changing the
background subtraction within reasonable limits does not
aﬀect our statistical conclusions about persistence expo-
nents and/or multifractality.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II,
we deﬁne the various dynamical correlation functions and
related statistical quantities, as well as the various expo-
nents to be used throughout our statistical analyses –
Sec. II is important in introducing the methodology of
our analyses; in Sec. III, we present our extensive results
and discussions; our concluding remarks are exposed in
Sec. IV.

II. NONEQUILIBRIUM STATISTICAL
MECHANICS TECHNIQUES

A. Price–price correlation functions and Extended
Self-Similarity

The generalized q–order price–price correlation func-

tion is deﬁned as

Gq(t) = h|x(t0 + t) − x(t0)|qi1/q,

(1)

where x(t) is the stock price and the average is over all
the initial times t0. Gq(t) has a power–law behavior

Gq(t) ∼ tHq ,

(2)

which deﬁnes the exponent hierarchy Hq, also called
the generalized Hurst exponent. The price evolution is

multif ractal if the exponent hierarchy Hq varies with
q, otherwise is fractal (in the theory of surface dynami-
cal scaling referred to as multi-aﬃne and self-aﬃne, re-
spectively).
In particular, for q = 2, we recover the
fractional Brownian motion case described by the well–
known Hurst exponent, 0 < H2 < 1. A simple way of
assigning the presence of multifractality in a stochastic
stock market is by looking at the multifractal spectra,
τq = qHq − 1. For fractals τq depends linearly on q. A
nonlinear behavior of τq vs. q is considered a manifesta-
tion of the multifractality.

The temporal behavior in Eq. (2) of the generalized
price–price correlation functions is analogous to the spa-
tial behavior of the q–order structure functions of turbu-
lent ﬂuids or the generalized height diﬀerence correlation
functions, Cq(r, t) = h|h(x + r, t) − h(x, t)|qi1/q ∼ rξq
(for small distances r), corresponding to surface growth
models. The multiscaling behavior is revealed by the q–
dependence of the scaling exponents ξq. The extended
self–similarity (ESS) behavior in both turbulent ﬂuids
and surface roughening models refers to the enhance-
ment of the scaling region once the log|Cm(r)| is plotted
against log|Cn(r)|, where m and n are two diﬀerent posi-
tive integers [16]. In this study we show that for diﬀerent
ﬁnancial stocks Gm(t) depends on Gn(t) in a power–law
fashion and, although the temporal scaling domain is not
necessarily enhanced as in the case of turbulent ﬂuids or
roughening models, the ESS behavior is clearly identiﬁed
and this interesting feature of the ﬁnancial stocks can be
further exploited to understand the associated multifrac-
tal character.

B. The Persistence Exponent of Fractional
Brownian Motion

The fractional Brownian motion (fBm) is one of the
simplest stochastic models that can be used to model
ﬁnancial stocks or any time series with long–range mem-
ory. Before proceeding further, we summarize the def-
inition and the known ﬁrst–passage property of a fBm.
We then describe the multifractal detrended ﬂuctuation
analysis (MF-DFA) method which is used to estimate the
generalized Hurst exponent.

A stochastic process ξ(t) (with zero mean hξ(t)i =
0) is called a fBm if its two–time correlation function
C(t1, t2) = h[ξ(t1) − ξ(t2)]2i is (i) stationary, i.e., de-
pends only on the time diﬀerence |t2 − t1| and (ii) grows
asymptotically as a power law [25]

C(t1, t2) ∼ |t2 − t1|2H ,

|t2 − t1| >> 1.

(3)

The parameter 0 < H < 1 is called the Hurst exponent
that characterizes the fBm and h· · · i denotes the expec-
tation value over all realizations of the process ξ(t). In
order to match the notation throughout the paper, let
us call the Hurst exponent H2 instead of H. For the
sake of completeness we also mention that, alternatively,

3

a zero mean stochastic process ξ(t) is called a fBm if its
autocorrelation function has the following expression:

aξ(t1, t2) = hξ(t1)ξ(t2)i ∼ t2H2

1 + t2H2

2 − |t2 − t1|2H2 . (4)

The zero crossing properties of a fBm have been studied
extensively in the past [26, 27, 28]. In particular, assum-
ing that ξ(t = 0) = 0, we are interested in the probability
P (t) that a fBm does not cross zero up to time t (i.e.,
the persistence probability):

P (t) = Prob {ξ(t′) > 0, ∀ t′ < t} .

(5)

In terms of the stochastic stock price variable x(t), char-
acterized by a particular value x(t0) at the initial time
t0, the probability of remaining always above that value
up to time t0 + t (i.e., positive persistence) reads

P+(t) = Prob {x(t0 + t

) > x(t0), ∀ t

< t} ,

(6)

′

′

and, similarly, the negative persistence probability reads

P−(t) = Prob {x(t0 + t′) < x(t0), ∀ t′ < t} .

(7)

These deﬁnitions can alternatively be reformulated in
terms of the cumulative time series of the discretized
log–returns. Let rj = ln [xj+∆j /xj] be the discrete set
of log–returns, with j = 0, 1, . . .. The sampling time
∆j is the interval between successive measurements. We

deﬁne the cumulative log–returns, Rj =
Rj = ln [xj/x0], the deﬁnition of the positive persistence
probability, for example, becomes:

P

P+(N ) = Prob {Rn > 0, ∀ 0 ≤ n < N } .

(8)

In several studies of linear surface growth models,
characterized by identical positive and negative persis-
tence probabilities, it has been shown that P (t) decays
as a power–law [9, 10] at large times, P (t) ∼ t−θ, with the
steady state persistence exponent θ obeying the relation

θ = 1 − H2.

(9)

We note that this relation holds for any zero mean pro-
cess (not necessarily Gaussian [27, 29]) that satisﬁes the
requirements (i) and (ii) above. Both analytic arguments
as well as numerical simulations supporting the relation
(9) have been presented previously in the literature in
the context of ﬂuctuating interfaces.
In this study we
investigate the behavior of P (t) at large times and its
dependence on the sampling time for both x(t) and ˜x(t)
stochastic variables.

The persistence probability can be generalized [17, 30]
using the persistent large deviations probability, P (t, s),
deﬁned as the probability for the “average sign” Sav of
the stock price ﬂuctuation to remain above a certain pre-
assigned value “s” up to time t:

P (t, s) ≡ Prob { Sav(t′) ≥ s, ∀t′ ≤ t },

Since Sav(t) ∈ [−1, 1], the probability P (t, s) is deﬁned
for −1 ≤ s ≤ 1. For s = 1 we recover our earlier simple
deﬁnition of persistence, while for s = −1 the probability
P (t, s = −1) is trivially equal to unity for all t. However,
for the remaining values of the average sign parameter s,
−1 < s < 1, the generalization of the persistence prob-
ability provides new information through the family of
persistent large deviations exponents, θl, associated with
the power–law behavior, P (t, s) ∼ t−θl(s), at large time
scales.

Nτ = [T /τ ]. For each segment we calculate the local
trend using a linear least–squared ﬁt Yτ (n, t) = an + bn t,
where t ∈ In and n = 1, . . . , Nτ . The local time series of
the cumulative log–returns is simply Xτ (n, t) = X[(n −
1)τ + t]. Therefore, the variance is given by

Perhaps of more practical interest in evaluating the
temporal trend of a ﬁnancial stock is the probability of
the stock’s price remaining above (below) a certain refer-
ence value up to a later time t0 + t, given that its initial
value at time t0 was above (below) that reference level,
i.e., the positive (negative) survival probability S±(t).
Let us denote by S(t) the average between the positive
and negative survival probabilities. This statistical quan-
tity oﬀers a better picture of the likelihood of a given
stock having a positive evolving trend, for example, with
respect to a preassigned reference value. The deﬁnition
of this probability reads:

S+(t) = Prob {x(t0 + t′) > ¯x, ∀ t′ < t} ,

(12)

where ¯x is the reference price. For simplicity we consider
¯x to be the average price over the measurement time,
tm, but in general it can take any value between the
minimum and the maximum values of x(t) for all the
discrete times t up to the ﬁnal measurement time. We
will show that S(t) depends independently on both tm
and δt and the scaling with t/δt appears only when δt/tm
is a constant. The same type of behavior has been found
recently in experimental thermal ﬂuctuations of surface
steps on Ag(111), screw dislocations on the facets of Pb
crystallites and Al–terminated Si(111) surfaces [18, 19].

D. Multifractal Detrended Fluctuations Analysis
(MF-DFA)

MF-DFA is a reliable method for analyzing correlated
time series. It is known to provide the accurate values of
the generalized Hurst exponents even for time series with
small length, while other similar methods, such as the
Hurst Rescaled Range Analysis [31], overestimate those
values in the case of small size series [32].

Let xi, i = 1, . . . , Tf be the stochastic price variable
recorded at discrete times i. The ﬁnal transaction time
is denoted by Tf . We denote by rj the log–return price

In order
F (n, τ ) is called the ﬂuctuation function.
to avoid disregarding some data points X(i) when the
length T of the time series is not a multiple of the time
lag τ , one has to repeat these steps starting from the
opposite end of the interval.
In that case, Xτ (n, t) in
Eq. (14) becomes equal to X[T − (n − Nτ )τ + t], for
n = Nτ + 1, . . . , 2Nτ . By averaging over all the segments
In we ﬁnally obtain the correlation function of order q,

[F 2(n, τ )]q/2

By construction, since we use a linear ﬁt for simplic-
ity, Fq(τ ) is deﬁned for τ ≥ 3. The scaling form of the
correlation function Fq(τ ) ∼ τ Hq provides the family of
generalized Hurst exponents, Hq. For reasons that will
become clearer very shortly we also introduce the dimen-
sionless ﬂuctuation function, f (n, τ ), deﬁned by

Obviously, fq obeys the same scaling relation as Fq,

However, for q = 2 (which corresponds to the usual DFA
procedure), the expression of this constant is known ex-
actly [33],

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

We ﬁrst discuss the results concerning the price–price
correlation functions calculated using Eq. (1). In Fig. 1
we present the results of Gq(t) for the high frequency
stocks and in Fig. 2 for the low frequency stocks. It is
obvious that since the log–log plots of Gq(t) vs.
t do
not exhibit linear behavior over the entire time range the
associated Hurst exponent Hq varies with time and the
scaling of the correlation functions suﬀers many transient
regimes. A good power–law dependence appears for q =
2. Although for other values of q the deviations from
power–law become visible it is clear that Hq decreases
with q. For illustration purpose we have ﬁtted certain
portions of these log–log plots to obtain a qualitative
view of the dependence of Hq on 1/q, as shown in Fig. 3.

In this ﬁgure we have used a large range of values for
q (i.e., q = 1/10, 1/9, ..., 1, 2, ..., 10). We notice that Hq
depends linearly on 1/q for both small and large values
of 1/q. The stock with the smallest sampling time of
δt = 1 minute (JJ 2000) displays an increase of Hq at
large values of 1/q, while for the rest of the stocks Hq
has the tendency to saturate as 1/q increases.

When using the MF-DFA method to calculate the cor-
relation functions of order q we note that the power–law
behavior of fq(τ ) vs. τ extends over longer time periods
making the extraction of the exponent Hq more reliable.
The results are shown in Figs. 4 and 5. This can be easily
seen in the case of the daily NYA index and INTC stocks.
The power–law is seen for more than three decades in
Fig. 5, while limited power–laws spanning two decades
only are seen in Fig. 2.

As we have already mentioned, the value of Hq is sensi-
tive to the ﬁtted region of the log–log plot of fq(τ ) vs. τ .
This issue requires special treatment. Our strategy was
to take advantage of the analytic result of Eq. (19) in
order to identify the time window over which the sec-
ond order Hurst exponent can be extracted correctly.

FIG. 3: (Color online) The generalized Hurst exponent Hq
vs. 1/q for the four stocks discussed in the paper. Hq behaves
linearly with 1/q at both small and large values of 1/q. For
the daily stocks a linear least–square ﬁt has been applied to
the ﬁrst two decades, while for the high frequency stocks, the
ﬁtted regions were 25 < t < 500 for the INTC 2000 stock and
25 < t < 400 for the JJ 2000 stock.

This can be achieved by adjusting H2 such that the
agreement between the empirical results for f2(τ ) using
Eq. (17) and the theoretical curve predicted by Eq. (18)
with q = 2 and Eq. (19) becomes very good. This
procedure is shown in Fig. 6. Once the time window
which gives the best agreement for q = 2 is identi-
ﬁed, we use it to extract Hq for a large set of q val-
ues (q = ±8, ±4, ±2, ±1, ±1/2, ±1/4, ±1/8). The re-
sults for the q–dependence of Hq based on the MF-DFA
method have been used to calculate the multifractal spec-
tra, τq = qHq − 1, shown in Fig. 7. We observe that
all spectra deviate from a linear q–dependence, which is
an obvious manifestation of the multifractality in these

dependence of Hq. At positive q, the qualitative trend
of the results is the same as in Fig. 3.
It is interest-
ing to point out that the empirical set with the smallest
sampling time, JJ 2000, which in the case of the stan-
dard price–price correlation function analysis has shown
an increasing trend of Hq at large values of 1/q, does not
present this trend anymore, Hq saturating quickly as 1/q
increases. Negative values of q are accessible within the
MF–DFA analysis. For large negative values of 1/q the
generalized Hurts exponents saturate rather fast, as in
the case of large positive values of 1/q.

The fact that Hq (and in particular H2) changes with
time is a clear indication of the multifractal character.
In this context we mention that the so–called multifrac-
tional Brownian motion could be alternatively used to
model this feature [32].

The analogy of the stock market ﬂuctuations and ﬂuid
turbulence has already been pointed out in the litera-
ture [34]. It is known that in turbulent ﬂuids the energy
dissipation rate shows violent ﬂuctuations. Similarly, as

q = −8, −4, −2, −1/2, 1/2, 2, 4, 8 from bottom to top in each
panel.

shown in Fig. 8, we ﬁnd that the temporal evolution of
the local stock price diﬀerences, |x(t+δt)−x(t)|, presents
strong ﬂuctuations which represent the signature of inter-
mittency. In addition, the self-extending similarity fea-
tures of intermittent ﬂuid turbulence have been shown
to exist in spatial height correlation functions of the ki-
netic surface roughening models. We show in Figs. 8
and 9 that the extended self–similarity exhibited by the
structure functions in ﬂuid turbulence also shows up in
the temporal behavior of the ﬁnancial stocks correlation
functions. This observation oﬀers a connection between
three distinct physical problems, apparently without any
intuitive connections: ﬂuid turbulence, surface roughen-
ing and ﬁnancial stocks.

For exempliﬁcation purpose we plot in Figs. 9 and 10
log|fm(τ )| vs. log|fn(τ )| for m = −1/2 and 2 and n = 1.
From the linear behavior of these plots it is obvious that
fm(τ ) ∼ [fn(τ )]αmn , where the expectation value for the
exponents αmn is αmn = Hm/Hn. We ﬁnd that our em-
pirical results for αmn are in very good agreement with

It would be interesting to check the exis-
tence of the extended self–similarity in other ﬁnancial
stocks. We mention that the analysis of correlation func-
tions based on the extended self–similarity is known to
provide reliable values of the ratios between several gen-
eralized Hurst exponents [16].

Next, we present in the results of the persistence prob-
abilities and persistence exponents for our ﬂuctuating
stocks.
In Fig. 11 we show the results based on the
minute–to–minute stocks and in Fig. 12 the daily stocks.
We observe that the best power–law appears for the av-
erage persistence probability P (t) = 1/2(P+(t) + P−(t)),
while departures from the power–law behavior can be
seen for P±(t) corresponding to the INTC 2000 stock
and more clearly for the daily stocks. For the low

tive, negative, and the average persistence probabilities
of the stochastic price variables, we have also consid-
ered the set of these three probabilities corresponding
to the empirical sets after the background elimination,
i.e., ˜x(t) = x(t) − a exp(bt). For the INTC stock we
have that a = 1.1703 and b = 1.1889 × 10−3, and for
NYA index a = 28.473 and b = 0.3177 × 10−3. The per-
sistence curves for the variable ˜x(t) are very similar in
the sense that no distinction between the positive, nega-
tive and average probabilities can be made. This result
agrees with previous studies of the persistence probabil-
ity of the German stock index [11]. We have used P (t)
and
P (t) in order to extract the persistence exponents
for the minute–to–minute and daily stocks, respectively.
The results are summarized in Tab. II. We compared
these values against 1 − H2, with H2 extracted from the
ﬁtted power–law of f2(τ ), in order to investigate the va-
lidity of Eq. (9). We ﬁnd a good agreement between θ
and 1 − H2. However, it is important to emphasize that
since both θ and H2 are very close to 1/2 the memory
eﬀects of the time series under investigation can only be
revealed by higher order correlation functions. The sec-
ond order correlation function by itself cannot explain
the multifractality discussed in this study since it indi-
cates that the returns are uncorrelated. We also add that
P (t) is not sensitive to the large discrepancy between δt
and tm corresponding to the high frequency stocks and
daily stocks, respectively.

The generalization of the persistence probability is
shown in Fig. 13. We only present the results for the
probability of persistent large deviations corresponding
to the INTC 2000 stock, but we have checked the appli-
cability of this concept to other empirical stocks as well.
From the linear behavior of logP (t, s) vs.
logt we con-
clude that the t–dependence of P (t, s) is indeed a power–
law. We see that the local slope decreases as the average
sign parameter s decreases. We have varied s from −1 to
1 with an increment of 0.1 and the s–dependence of the
resulting family of persistent large deviations exponents
is shown in the inset of Fig. 13. We mention that each
curve in Fig. 13 corresponds to the average between the
positive and negative persistent large deviations prob-
abilities, i.e., P (t, s) = 1/2(P+(t, s) + P−(t, s)). Both
P+(t, s) and P−(t, s) show departures from the expected
power–laws at large t, as we have seen in Figs. 11 and

Finally we show the results of the survival probability
in Fig. 14. We have looked at the temporal evolution
of the JJ 2000 stock price recorded with two diﬀerent
sampling times, of 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. We
have chosen diﬀerent values of the measurement time,
tm, which inﬂuences directly the value of the average
0 dt′ x(t′). As shown in upper panel of
price ¯x = 1/tm
Fig. 14 the survival probability measured over a longer tm
R
has a slower decrease with time than the one correspond-
ing to a smaller tm. We ﬁnd that the empirical measure-
ments of S(t) show good scaling with t/δt at short times
(t < 300 minutes), when the ration between the sam-
pling time and measurement time is kept constant. This
agrees with similar measurements done on experimental
step ﬂuctuations [18]. Since a very simple interpretation
of the stock market ﬂuctuations is based on the random
walk model, we have numerically simulated the survival
behavior of a random walker which allows us to under-
stand qualitatively all the features of S(t) found exper-
imentally. Measurements of S(t) for the random walk

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We conclude with some speculative thoughts on the
possible development of “understanding” in the sense
of physics with respect to stock price ﬂuctuations.
In
physics, e.g. step ﬂuctuations [9, 10, 17, 18, 19] or kinetic
surface roughening [13], one typically looks for minimal
(in the renormalization group sense) dynamical (in gen-
eral, nonlinear) stochastic continuum partial diﬀerential
equations underlying the stochastic phenomena, e.g., the
Edwards–Wilkinson equation [35], the Mullins–Herring
equation [36], the Kardar–Parisi–Zhang equation [37],
the Villain–Lai–Das Sarma equation [38, 39], etc., hop-
ing to derive the long–time coarse–grained asymptotic
power law behavior of the system arising from some sim-
ple minimal underlying dynamics (which is often based
on symmetry and universality considerations). It is un-
clear whether such an approach based on continuum non-
linear stochastic equations is at all meaningful for the un-
derstanding of the dynamical evolution of complex eco-
nomic phenomena such as stock price ﬂuctuations.
It
may be possible to empirically construct dynamical equa-
tions which are suﬃcient to reproduce the exponents and
the related statistical stochastic behavior described in
this paper, but the necessary conditions for obtaining
such equations are simply unknown (in fact, we do not
know if such equations exist, except in some “trivial”
data ﬁtting sense). It is therefore quite intriguing that
stock price ﬂuctuation data are amenable to stochastic
analyses based on ﬁrst–passage statistics and multifrac-
tality (as carried out in this article) with results not that
dissimilar from physical processes such as step ﬂuctua-
tions or nonequilibrium growth.

To summarize, in this study we have analyzed the mul-
tifractality, extended self–similarity, and ﬁrst–passage
properties of several ﬁnancial stocks. While the second
order Hurts exponent and the persistence exponent char-
acterizing the power–law decay of the average persistence
probability are not able to explain the long–term corre-
lations in the investigated price time series, higher or-
der correlation functions reveal much richer information
about the complicated dynamics of such systems. We
have shown that the persistence exponent θ is in agree-
ment with 1 − H2 and does not depend on the sampling
time and measurement time. However the survival prob-
ability has a nontrivial dependence on both δt and tm,
presenting scaling with t/δt only when the ration δt/tm
is a constant. The numerical simulations of persistence,
survival, and extended self–similarity features using dis-
crete models of ﬁnancial stocks remain on interesting
open problem.

The authors wish to thank A. Christian Silva and Vic-
tor M. Yakovenko for useful discussions and providing
most of the empirical data sets used in this study. This
work is partially supported by NSF and US–ONR.

FIG. 14: (Color online) The average survival probability S(t)
vs. t/δt for the JJ 2000 stock (top) with diﬀerent sampling
times and diﬀerent measurement times, as shown in the leg-
end. The bottom plot contains the numerical simulation of
S(t) corresponding to a random walk with L = 100. The
scaling of S(t) with t/δt appears when δt/tm is constant. The
inset shows the same curves on a logarithmic–linear scale.

model were carried out for systems of size L = 100. The
measured average of the random walker variable at each
site over the measurement time was used as the reference
level in the calculation of the survival probability and the
results were averaged over 300 independent runs. In bot-
tom panel of Fig. 14 we show that a perfect collapse of
S(t) vs. t/δt appears when the ratio δt/tm is constant. In
addition, S(t) corresponding to the data recorded with
the same δt shows a slower decrease when the measure-
ment time is larger, as in the empirical case. Therefore
both sampling time and total measurement time have to
be taken into consideration in order to interpret correctly
the survival features of the ﬁnancial systems. We want
to point out that S(t) does not show an exponential be-
havior over the investigated time range (see the inset of
the bottom panel of Fig. 14), and possibly much larger
tm is needed to observe such a behavior at large time
scales, as it happens in the case of equilibrium surface

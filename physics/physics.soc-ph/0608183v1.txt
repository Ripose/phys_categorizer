Superiority of the h-index over the Impact Factor for Physics

Casey W. Miller
Department of Physics, University of California, San Diego
9500 Gilman Drive, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA

Focusing speciﬁcally on physics periodicals, I show that the journal Impact Factor is not correlated
with Hirsch’s h-index. This implies that the Impact Factor is not a good measure of research
quality or inﬂuence because the h-index is a reﬂection of peer review, and thus a strong indicator
of research quality. The impact gap between multidisciplinary journals and physics-only journals
is signiﬁcantly reduced when h is used instead of the Impact Factor. Additionally, the impact of
journals specializing in review articles is inherently deﬂated using h because of the limited number
of annual publications in such periodicals. Finally, a reordering of the top ranking journals occurs
with h when only the physics articles of multidisciplinary journals are considered, falling more in
line with the average physicist’s interpretation of a journal’s prestige.

The journal

Impact Factor (IF ) has earned the
adjective notorious for several reasons1,2,3. First,
in
contradiction to healthy philosophies of science, the
data used to determine the IF are not publicly avail-
able. Second, authors have reported unethical editorial
practices that have the motive of increasing a journal’s
IF, including editors insisting that additional references
to their journal be added to a bibliography before
accepting an article for publication. Third, publishing in
high-IF journals is used as a ﬁlter for hiring tenure-track
faculty and advancement to tenure. R. Monastersky’s
“The number that’s devouring science” highlights other
intriguing issues1, and astutely notes that the pragmatic
motto “publish or perish” has mutated to “publish in a
high-impact journal or perish.”

The impact factor is, in spirit, a reasonable metric:
the total number of citations divided by the total
number of articles4. The three highest IF periodicals
in which physicists publish were reported for 2003 as
Nature (31.0), Science (29.2), and Reviews of Modern
Physics (28.2)5. Many physicists ﬁnd it odd that
Physical Review Letters, historically the most well
respected physics journal, boasts a meager 7.0. Another
indication that the IF rankings are questionable is that
experts disagree with the rankings for their subﬁelds:
few of the top titles are recognized, and even fewer are
considered prestigious. Upon inspection, most of the top
IF journals in each subﬁeld specialize in review articles.
Review articles are typically highly cited, though only
a few articles are published annually. This causes such
journals’ high (and arguably, anomalous) IF, while
simultaneously making original research journals appear
relatively weak.

Based on the IF ’s several peculiarities, alternative
measures of journal quality are being sought.
In my
opinion, the only reasonable way to rank physics journals
is for physicists to measure the quality of published
physics in each journal. While this may at ﬁrst seem
unrealistic, an indirect form of this type of peer review
already exists in the form of citations. Articles of high
quality or broad interest receive many more citations
low quality or limited interest, and
than articles of
are therefore more scientiﬁcally inﬂuential. Extending

this idea to periodicals, one can inspect the citation
and publication history of a journal in a scientiﬁc and
unbiased way to determine the average impact of its
publications.
I thus propose the h-index as a logical
measure of a journal’s inﬂuence on science.

The h-index, developed by J. E. Hirsch to quantify
the scientiﬁc research output of an individual6, has
become popular because it is logically sound, simple to
understand, and, most importantly, simple to calculate
with easily obtained data. An individual’s h-index
is determined by searching a scientiﬁc database like
Thompson’s ISI Web of Knowledge7 for all articles
by an author, and ranking the output articles by the
number of citations such that article 1 has the most
citations; h is the rank of the lowest ranking article
whose number of citations is bounded below by its rank.
One can arbitrarily extend this procedure to journals,
departments, institutions, or even zip codes. A graphical
deﬁnition of the h-index is shown in the inset of Fig. 1.
If c(p) is the number of citations for paper p in the
ordered list, then h is the intersection of c(p) with the
line c′(p) = p. I have empirically observed that c(p) is
bounded below by a right isosceles triangle with legs of
length 2h, such as ABC; violations are more likely to
exist for scientiﬁcally young subjects due to inadequate
statistics. An (approximately) equivalent deﬁnition of h
is the coordinate of the intersection of the hypotenuse
BC with c′(p) = p.

The total number of citations can be used to develop
a related, but arguably more poignant index. Consider
ADE, a similar triangle of ABC, whose area (α) equals
Pp c(p). Using the geometric deﬁnition, a new index,
which I cannot resist naming the ¯h-index, is the coor-
dinate of the intersection of the hypotenuse DE with
the line c′(p) = p, or mathematically, ¯h = p(α/2). The
¯h-index is a more comprehensive measure of the overall
structure of c(p) for two reasons. First, ¯h incorporates
the most highly cited articles, while h basically ignores
all articles with citations much greater than h. Second,
¯h takes into account the body of articles with moderate
numbers of citations, while h again ignores all such
articles.

subﬁelds of physics. (Inset) Graphical representation of the
indices h and ¯h as deﬁned in the text.

To illustrate the main diﬀerence between h and ¯h,
consider two similarly aged11, fully tenured, condensed
matter physicists from the University of California, San
Diego: L. J. Sham and I. K. Schuller. These professors are
both well respected in this ﬁeld, and have each received
numerous awards for their scientiﬁc achievements. Both
indicating that they have contributed
have h = 54,
approximately the same amount to science. However, h
does not take into account that Sham’s article with W.
Kohn12 that introduced density functional theory−for
which Kohn was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1998−is the
most highly cited paper in the history of Physical Review.
Professor Schuller, on the other hand, has a large body
of work and is among the most highly cited researchers
in physics, though his single most highly cited paper has
an order of magnitude fewer citations than Sham’s (and
neither he nor his immediate coworkers has yet to win
the Nobel Prize).
I ﬁnd that Sham has ¯h = 102, and
Schuller has ¯h = 76. Thus the Sham-Schuller Paradox
is resolved using ¯h. Degeneracies with the ¯h-index will
of course exist, but these will not be as qualitatively
displeasing as in this and similar cases.

D. J. Scalapino (76, 95), S. G. Louie (76, 97), R. Jackiw

S. W. Hawking (62, 98).

Applying the h-index to individuals has proven very

eﬀective. Hirsch unequivocally showed that a large
h, and more importantly dh/dt, indicates a successful
scientist. Additionally, a recent hind-sight study showed
a strong correlation between h and committee peer
review:
individuals that were granted prestigious post-
doctoral fellowships8 in biomedicine by a committee of
well known scientists in that ﬁeld from 1990 to 1995
had on average higher h-indices than other applicants9.
Upon reﬂection, this study indicates the obvious: h
measures how one’s contributions are viewed by one’s
peers. Highly valued articles will receive many citations
from the scientiﬁc community, which will result in a
higher h-index for the authors or publishing journal.
Similar correlation of h with peer review was recently
demonstrated in chemistry10.

I compared the rankings of scientiﬁc periodicals
frequently targeted by physicists from a variety of
subﬁelds using h and ¯h to evaluate the IF as a measure
of research quality. The data used to calculate both
indices were obtained using ISI to search by “source”,
limited to 1990-2006, and the following document types:
Article, Letter, Review, Correction, Editorial Material,
or Note. The latter three were included because com-
ments, errata, and retractions are listed under these
headings.
Journals that began publishing after 1990
were excluded13. I chose sixteen years as an estimate of
the time between entering graduate school and receiving
tenure at a university. Additionally, this long timescale
reduces the inﬂuence of high frequency ﬂuctuations,
such as those due to spectacular claims that are often

disproved soon after their initial publication (the IF
only uses two years4). The data were harvested in a 10
day window in late March, 2006; results are presented in
Table I.

Figure 1 shows the h-index of ﬁfty physics-related
periodicals. As I discuss below, the relatively large h
of the top four is due to the fact that these periodicals
publish articles from other scientiﬁc disciplines, which
inﬂates their indices relative to physics-only journals.
Physical Review Letters also has a jump relative to the
remaining physics journals. This is probably because it
publishes work from all of physics, while the others are
for speciﬁc subﬁelds.

Figure 2 shows the journals ranked using ¯h, h,
and the 2003 IF as published in the Journal Citation
Report5 for twenty titles with h > 100. The arrows
show how the individual journals change rank when
analyzed with the diﬀerent indices. A journal’s rank
changes by an average of 1.3 positions between ¯h and
h, 4.4 between ¯h and IF, and 3.4 between h and IF.
The IF -based rankings are inconsistent with h and ¯h.
This means the IF is inconsistent with peer review, and
is direct evidence that the IF is not a good measure of
the quality of physics published in a particular journal.
Interestingly, the greatest leap of −17 places was made
by Reviews of Modern Physics. This may indicate that

h intrinsically solves the impact inﬂation problem of
review journals.

The large discrepancy between indices for Nature and
Science relative to physics-only journals is due to the
fact that their indices are inﬂated by work from other
scientiﬁc ﬁelds14. Evidence of this inﬂation includes: 1)
I can only identify ∼ 8% of the top h articles in Nature
and Science as physics research based on a qualitative
assessment of their content by their titles15. 2) Physics
articles represent only a small
fraction of the total
number of articles in these periodicals, which means
fewer physics articles per unit time. The total number
of articles is important in determining h and ¯h. Fewer
articles means fewer citations, and thus an inherently
lower h-index (as seen with Reviews of Modern Physics).
these points indicate that the impact of
Together,
multidisciplinary journals, regardless of the metric,
is
heavily weighted by topics other than physics.

An important question naturally presents itself: how
does the subset of physics articles in multidisciplinary
periodicals compare with physics-only journals?
To
investigate this, an automated ﬁlter was used to select
“physics” articles from the aforementioned data set of
Nature publications. The selection criteria were based
solely on the references of each article. An article
initially qualiﬁed as physics if it contained at least one
physics reference. The percentage of an article’s total
references that qualiﬁed as physics references served as a
ﬁnal, tunable ﬁlter. A reference was deemed a “physics

4

of the decreasing number of qualifying articles. The
data around the inﬂection points (20-50%) were ﬁt to
lines, and the ordinate-intercepts were used to deﬁne
physics-speciﬁc indices. I thus determined ¯hphys = 499,
and hphys = 285. The latter is in good agreement with
the manual analysis based on article titles: hphys = 263
(hphys = 260 for Science). With ¯h = 869 and h = 305,
Physical Review Letters ranks higher than Nature (and
presumably Science) for both indices. The origin of the
large discrepancy between ¯hphys and ¯h for Nature and
Physical Review Letters, respectively, is probably due to
the large percentage of uncited articles in Nature (see
Table I).

In summary, the journal IF was shown to be in-
consistent with the h-index.
Insofar as h reﬂects peer
review, and peer review reﬂects research quality, these
results indicate that the IF is a poor measure of research
quality. An additional beneﬁt of h is its intrinsic
grounding of the impact of review journals, whose IF is
anomalously enhanced by their few annual publications.
I showed that the impact of multidisciplinary journals is
enhanced relative to physics-only journals by the more
numerous non-physics articles contained therein. An
analysis of the physics subset of Nature and Science
revealed that Physical Review Letters has a greater h
than either of these article subsets. This is in accord
with Physical Review Letters’ historical status as the
most reputable physics journal. Based on these many
observations, I conclude that the indices h and ¯h are
superior to the journal IF as indications of the quality
of research published in a journal.

biophys, etc.) or speciﬁc abbreviations (phys fluids,
j phys b, etc.), and did not contain other strings
(physio, rehab, etc.)16. The ﬁlter excluded nature
and science because a disproportionate number of
references contain at least one of these strings, which
would have undermined this analysis. This method is
certainly not perfect, but it is robust in the sense that
perturbing the search strings does not signiﬁcantly alter
the results; the indices change by less than ﬁve percent
when phys rev is purposefully excluded with the ﬁlter.

due to physics references in non-physics articles. Both

The dynamics of traded value revisited

(Dated: 8th January 2013)

We conclude from a careful analysis of high resolution NYSE data that, contrary to previous
arguments, the distribution of the traded value fi (or volume) has a ﬁnite variance σi for any stock
i, and the distribution itself is non-universal across stocks. The Hurst exponent of the same time
series displays a crossover from weakly to strongly correlated behavior around the time scale of 1
day. The persistence in the strongly correlated regime increases with the average trading activity
hfii as Hi = H0 + γ log hfii, which is another sign of non-universal behavior. The existence of such
liquidity dependent correlations is consistent with the empirical observation that σi ∝ hfii
, where
α is a non-trivial, time scale dependent exponent.

The recent years have seen a number of important con-
tributions of physics to various areas, among them to ﬁ-
nance [1, 2]. The application of physical concepts often
seems well suited to the analysis of ﬁnancial time series,
however, it is not without caveats. Often, the theoretical
background of these methods is deeply rooted in physical
laws that – naturally – do not apply to stock markets.
In particular, observations regarding power laws [3], uni-
versality [4], and other empirical regularities [5] are often
criticized. We carried out a thorough study of the traded
value per unit time [6, 7, 8] and have arrived at the result
that some earlier conclusions have to be modiﬁed. Here
we present an analysis of some new data, which supports
our earlier ﬁndings.

The paper is organized as follows. Section I introduces
notations. Section II shows that – contrary to previous
results – the distribution of traded volume/value is not
universal, and it is not Levy stable. Section III shows,
that traded value displays only weak correlations for time
scales shorter than one day. On longer horizons there
is stronger persistence whose degree depends logarithmi-
cally on the liquidity of the stock. Finally, Section IV
surveys the concept of ﬂuctuation scaling, shows how it
complements the observed liquidity dependence of cor-
relations, and how those two form a consistent scaling
theory.

I. NOTATIONS AND DATA

For a ﬁxed time window size ∆t, let us denote the total

traded value of the ith stock at time t by

f ∆t
i

(t) =

X
n,ti(n)∈[t,t+∆t]

Vi(n),

(1)

†Also at Laboratory of Computational Engineering, Helsinki Uni-
versity of Technology, Espoo, Finland

where ti(n) is the time when the nth transaction of the
ith stock takes place. Tick-by-tick data are denoted by
Vi(n), this is the value traded in transaction n, calculated
as the product of the price and the traded volume.

Since price changes very little from trade to trade while
variations of trading volume are much faster, the ﬂuctua-
tions of the traded value fi(t) are basically determined by
those of traded volume. Price merely acts as a weighting
factor that enables one to compare diﬀerent stocks, while
this also automatically corrects the data for stock splits
and dividends. The correlation properties and the nor-
malized distribution are nearly indistinguishable between
traded volume and traded value.

This study is based on the complete Trades and Quotes
database of New York Stock Exchange for the period
1994 − 1995.

Note that throughout the paper we use 10-base loga-

rithms.

II. TRADED VALUE DISTRIBUTIONS
REVISITED

In this section, we ﬁrst revisit the analysis done in Ref.
[9]. That work ﬁnds that the cumulative distribution
function of traded volume for time windows of ∆t = 15
minutes decays as a power-law with a tail exponent λ =
1.7 ± 0.1 for a wide range of stocks. This is the so called
inverse half cube law, and it can be written as

P∆t(f ) ∝ f −(λ+1),

(2)

where P∆t is the probability density function of the same
quantity.

The estimation of tail exponents is often diﬃcult due
to poor statistics of rare events, large stock-to-stock vari-
ations and the presence of correlations. For the same
1994 − 1995 period of data and the same 15 minute time
window certain stocks have λ values signiﬁcantly higher
than 1.7 [see Fig. 1(left)]. The tails of these distribu-
tions can be ﬁtted by a power law over an order of mag-
nitude, for the top 3 − 10% of the events. The exponent

λ is around 2.8 for these examples. The question arises:
Which value (if any) is correct?

In order to address this question we carried out a sys-
tematic investigation comprising the 1000 stocks with the
highest total traded value in the TAQ database. We used
variants of Hill’s method [10, 11] to estimate the typical
tail exponent, see Ref. [7] for details. The results of this
Section are summarized in Table I. Note that in all cases
the U -shaped intraday pattern of trading activity was
removed.

Most descendants of Hill’s method, including the ones
applied here, contain a free parameter, namely the frac-
tion p of top events to be considered to belong to the
tail of the distribution (see Ref.
[11] and refs. therein).
According to Fig.
1(left) this should be set around
p ≈ 3 − 10%.

First, let us follow the methodology of Ref. [9]. In that
paper, the authors ﬁrst they deduct the mean from the
time series by taking fi(t) − hfii, where h·i denotes time
averaging. Then this series is used to estimate value of
λ by applying Hill’s method [12]. The choice p = 0.03
provides results in line with Ref.
[9], for ∆t = 15 min
time windows one ﬁnds λ = 1.67±0.20. There are several
issues with this approach:

1. p is a parameter that can be chosen arbitrarily.
With the variation of p the same procedure can
produce estimates ranging from λ = 1.1 ± 0.2
(p = 0.10) to λ = 2.15 ± 0.2 (p = 0.005).

2. The transformation signiﬁcantly decreases the esti-
mates of λ, down to the range of Levy stable distri-
butions (λ < 2). Estimates for the untransformed
data are given in Table I for comparison.

It is simple to show, that the ﬁrst issue emerges, i.e. the
estimates systematically depend on p, when one applies
Hill’s method to a ﬁnite sample from a distribution of the
form

P∆t(f ) ∝ (f + f0)−(λ+1),

(3)

where f0 is a non-zero constant. The transformation to
fi(t) − hfii does not resolve the problem, but biases the
estimates further.

Instead, to correct for these biases one can (i) either
ﬁnd the proper constant f0, remove it from the data, and
apply Hill’s estimator afterwards (ii) or apply the esti-
mator of Fraga-Alves [11], which is insensitive to such
shifts. Both of these estimates were found to be signiﬁ-
cantly higher [20]: λ > 2, see Table I. The methods are
described in detail in Ref. [7].

The two corrected estimators show a strong tendency
of increasing λ with increasing ∆t. Monte Carlo simu-
lations on surrogate datasets show that this is beyond
what could be explained by decreasing sample size. For
distributions with λ < 2 increasing window size should
result in a convergence to the corresponding Levy distri-
bution, and the measured λ’s should be independent of
∆t. Only when λ > 2 can the measured eﬀective value of

2

λ systematically increase with ∆t. This dependence is a
strong indication that the distribution is not Levy stable,
and thus the second moment exists.

Note that our calculations assume that the variable
is asymptotically distributed as (3) and do not prove it.
Still, the existence of the second moment is guaranteed
by the absence of convergence to a Levy distribution.
Consequently, it is possible to deﬁne the Hurst exponent
for fi(t).

Regardless of the absence of Levy stability there are
qualitative similarities in the shape of the traded value
distributions of various stocks [cf. Fig. 1(left)]. Never-
theless, the existence of a universal distribution can be
rejected by a simple test [21].

If the form of the normalized distribution was univer-
sal, then the ratio of the standard deviation and the mean
would have to obey σi/ hfii = h, where h is a constant
independent of the stock. Equivalently, a relationship

σi ∝ hfiiα

(4)

would have to hold with an exponent α = 1, at least on
average. Even though one ﬁnds a monotonic dependence
between the two quantities [as shown in Fig. 1(right)],
the exponent is signiﬁcantly less than 1. This means,
that the ratio σ/ hf i decreases with growing hf i, i.e., the
normalized distribution of f is narrower for larger stocks,
so their trading exhibits smaller relative ﬂuctuations. We
will return to this observation in Section IV.

III. NON-UNIVERSALITY OF CORRELATIONS
IN TRADED VALUE TIME SERIES

One of the classical tools of both ﬁnancial analysis and
physics is the measurement of the correlation properties
of time series [1, 2, 13]. In particular, scaling methods
[14] have a long tradition in the study of physical systems,
where the Hurst exponent Hi is often calculated. For the
traded value time series f ∆t
(t) of stock i this is deﬁned
as

i

(t) −

f ∆t

(t)

(cid:10)

(cid:11)(cid:3)

E ∝ ∆t2Hi ,

(5)

Note that it follows from the results of Section II that the
variance on the left hand side exists regardless of stock
and for any window size ∆t.

The measurements were carried out for all 2474 stocks
that were continuously available on the market during
1994 − 1995 [22]. Then we sorted the stocks into 6
groups according to the order of magnitude of their av-
erage traded value: 0 ≤ hf i ≤ 104, 104 ≤ hf i ≤ 105, . . . ,
108 ≤ hf i, all values in USD/min. Finally we averaged
σ2
i (∆t) within each group. The obtained scaling plots are
shown in Fig. 2.

All stocks display a crossover around window sizes of
∆t = 60 − 390 min, and there are two sets of Hurst ex-
ponents: H −
i above the crossover.
These characterize the strength of intraday and long time

α(15 min) = 0.74, and α(390 min) = 0.78. A linear proportionality would support the existence of a universal distribution.
However, the sublinear scaling relationship suggests that relative ﬂuctuations in trading activity are smaller for stocks with
higher average liquidity. Note: For better visibility, stocks were binned according to hf i and their log σ was averaged. The

law:

1. For intraday ﬂuctuations, regardless of stock H − ≈
0.51 − 0.52. This means that intraday ﬂuctuations
of traded value are nearly uncorrelated.

2. For long time ﬂuctuations the data are correlated,
but the strength of correlations depends strongly on
the liquidity of the stock. As one moves to groups of
larger hf i, the strength of correlations (H +) grows,
up to H + ≈ 0.8.

These results indicate, at least in the case of traded
value, the absence of universal behavior. Liquidity (or,
analogously, company size) is a relevant quantity, which
acts as a continuous parameter of empirical observables,
in particular the strength of correlations and the dis-
tribution of f . Related results can be found in Refs.
[7, 15, 16, 17].

plotting the dependence of H ± on hf i, as done in Fig.

activity of stocks we have already presented this result
in Section II [cf. Eq. (4)]. Now we give a more detailed
discussion.

Let us start from our observation that

σi(∆t) ∝ hfiiα(∆t) ,

(7)

where the scaling variable is hfii, or more appropriately
the stock i, and ∆t is kept constant [see Fig. 1(right)].
Notice that σi(∆t) is the same as in the deﬁnition of the
Hurst exponent in Eq. (5), where i was constant and ∆t
was varied.

In Eq. (7) the window size ∆t is a free parameter. This
scaling law persists for any ∆t, but α strongly depends
on its value, as shown in Fig. 4. For small time windows
(up to 60 min), α(∆t) ≈ 0.74, then, after a crossover
regime, when ∆t > 390 min, there is a logarithmic trend.
This can be summarized as

α(∆t) = α±

0 + γ± log ∆t,

(8)

where ·± refers to the regimes ∆t < 60 min and ∆t >
390 min. The constants are α−
0 = 0.74, γ− = 0, and
γ+ = 0.052 ± 0.01. For shuﬄed time series, α(∆t) = 0.74
regardless of ∆t, i.e., γshuﬀ = 0.

A visual comparison of Figs. 2 and 4 reveals that the
crossover in the behavior of α(∆t) and H falls into the

time period 1994 − 1995. For short time windows (O, ∆t < 60
min) all signals are nearly uncorrelated, H − ≈ 0.51 − 0.53.
The ﬁtted slope is γ− = 0.00 ± 0.01. For larger time win-
dows ((cid:4), ∆t > 390 min) the strength of correlations depends
logarithmically on the mean trading activity of the stock,
γ+ = 0.053 ± 0.01 for 1994 − 1995. Shuﬄed data (⋆) dis-
play no correlations, thus Hshuﬀ = 0.5, which also implies

the standard deviations in the bins.

same interval. Moreover, when ∆t < 60 min, both α(∆t)
and H −(hf i) are constant. For ∆t > 390 min, both
α(∆t) and H +(hf i) vary logarithmically with their argu-
ments (see Figs. 3 and 4).

In order to better understand the connection between
temporal correlations and ﬂuctuation scaling, let us re-
peat here Eqs. (6) and (8):

α(∆t) = α±
Hi = H ±

0 + γ± log ∆t,
0 + γ± log hfii .

Beyond the obvious symmetry of these two logarithmic
laws, notice that the prefactors are equal: in both equa-
tions γ− ≈ 0 and γ+ ≈ 0.05.

It is easy to show [8] that none of this is a simple
coincidence. If both ﬂuctuation scaling and long range
autocorrelations are present in data, there are only two
possible ways for their coexistence:

1. Correlations are homogeneous throughout the sys-
tem, Hi = H0, γ = 0, and α is independent of ∆t.
This is realized for ∆ < 60 min. For shuﬄed time
series correlations are absent, thus such data also
fall into this category.

2. Both the H(hfii) and α(∆t) are logarithmic func-
tions of their arguments with the same coeﬃcient
γ+. This is realized for ∆ > 390 min.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we analyzed the empirical properties of
trading activity on the New York Stock Exchange. We
showed that, in contrast to earlier ﬁndings, the distri-
bution of traded value is not Levy stable, and its dis-
tribution is not universal. Traded value is nearly un-
correlated on an intraday time scale, while on daily or
longer scales ﬂuctuations show strong persistence, whose
strength grows logarithmically with the liquidity of the
stock. This eﬀect is in harmony with ﬁndings on ﬂuc-
tuation scaling, a general scaling framework for complex
systems.

All our results imply, that the notion of universality
must be used with extreme care in the context of ﬁ-
nancial markets, where the concepts and the theoretical
background are radically diﬀerent from those in physics.
The liquidity of a stock strongly aﬀects the distribution
and the correlation structure of its trading activity. This
dependence is continuous, which means the absence of
universality classes in trading dynamics. The dynamical
process responsible for such a dependence is yet to be
identiﬁed.

so restrictive, that if the strength of correlations depends

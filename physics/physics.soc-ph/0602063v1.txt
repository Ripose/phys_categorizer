Thermodynamic approach for community discovering within the complex networks:
LiveJournal study.

Pavel Zakharov
Department of Physics, University of Fribourg, CH-1700, Switzerland, email: Pavel.Zakharov@unifr.ch

The thermodynamic approach of concentration mapping is used to discover communities in di-
rectional friendship network of LiveJournal users. We are showing that this social network can be
classiﬁed as scale-free and exhibits small-world properties together with high clustering. To study
the community structure we are simulating diﬀusion of virtual substance immersed in such a net-
work as in multi-dimensional porous system. By analyzing concentration proﬁles at intermediate
stage of the diﬀusion process the well-interconnected cliques of users can be identiﬁed as nodes with
equal concentrations.

In recent years there has been an enormous break-
through in research of complex networks due to the appli-
cation of statistical physics methodology[1, 2]. Many dif-
ferent complex systems instead of being completely ran-
dom proved to have signatures of organization such as
clustering and power-law distribution of links. Together
with the small-world property these are the inherent fea-
tures of an extremely wide variety of systems such as
world-wide web[3], Internet[4], movie actors collabora-
tion network[5, 6], scientists collaboration graph[6] and
web of human sexual contacts[7] to name only few. In
spite of the fact that some concepts of complex networks
theory were originally introduced in sociology the statis-
tical study of social networks is complicated by diﬃculty
of the data collection. For privacy and ethical reasons it
is not easy to reconstruct the network of people relations
if possible at all. One of the solutions is the analysis of
collaboration networks[5, 6], e-mail interactions[8, 9, 10]
or instant messaging[11]. Here we extend the class of
social networks within Internet environment by the net-
work of journals readers/writers on the case of popular

LiveJournal system.

LiveJournal (LJ) is an online web-based journal open-
source service with an emphasis on user interaction[12].
In January, 2006 it has 9.3 · 106 users in total, 2 · 106 of
them were active in some way according to oﬃcial Live-
Journal statistics[13]. The essential feature of LJ service
is a “friends” concept which helps users to organize their
reading preferences and provides security regulations for
their journal entries and personal data. Friends list is an
open information and can not be hidden by the user or
LJ administration. The access to friends list and to the
list of users who are considering the given user as a friend
can be performed through conventional web interface or
through simple to use bot interface provided by LJ so the
full database can be easily explored.

Data collection was performed by crawler programs
running simultaneously on two computers and exploring
the LJ space by following directional friends links start-
ing from two users with the maximum number of links.
The LJ bots interface was utilized to optimize the collec-
tion speed. For each user the crawler was obtaining his
friends list (outgoing links) and the number of users who
have the given user in their friends list (incoming links).
The user from the friends list which was not yet known to
the crawler was added to the end of processing queue if
he was not there yet. If the user was already in the queue
his queue score was incremented every time he was found
in someones’ friends list. Users with higher queue scores
were processed ﬁrst. This ensured fast collection of the
essential part of the network. Total time of collection
was 14 days with the total number of discovered users
3.698 · 106 found in a giant connected component 95% fo
which were processed and analyzed. We are aware that
during the time of collection the network was undergo-
ing continuous changes but we believe that this process
did not inﬂuence much our statistics. As an example the
number of users deleted from the LJ database but still
present in the friends lists was less than 0.1%.

The mean estimated number of

friends per user
hkouti = 16.71 and the mean number of users which count
user as a friend is hkini = 16.73. The average in-to-out
ratio is hkin/kouti = 1.163. The number of incoming
links is slightly larger than the number of outgoing due
to the fact that only the outgoing links were used for

navigation so some of the LJ users were unreachable by
directional links if they are noone’s friends but they are
still aﬀecting the statistics of incoming links.

There are also several technical restrictions for degrees:
users are allowed to have maximum 750 friends, only 150
of them can be listed on the users’ info page and so can
be easily accessed. The number of incoming links does
not pose any problems for a user but from our experience
LJ bots interface does have some problems listing users
if the number of them is more than 2200 so we cut the
data up to kmax = 2500.

The estimated in and out degree distributions are pre-
sented in log-log scale on the Fig. 1. As one can see both
distributions demonstrate linear decay in log-log scale for
k > 100 with the slopes γin ≈ γout = −3.45 ± 0.05 which
is surprisingly close to the values γin = γout ≈ 3.4 ob-
tained by Liljeros et al. for sexual contacts[7]. The skew-
ness of the distributions can be explained by the social
origin of LJ network. As it was pointed out by Jin et
al.[14] degree distibuition for social networks does not
appear to follow power-law distribution due to the cost
in terms of time and eﬀorts to support friendship. In the
case of LJ network the cost of friendship is the size of
friends feed which accumulates all the recent entries of
the user’s friends. We can also separate two classes of
LJ users: readers and writers. The ﬁrst are mainly using
their accounts to read the journals of others. They up-
date journals only episodically and are not really deeply
involved in LJ community so they do not have that many
incoming and outgoing links and they are responsible for
skewness of the distribuitions for k < 100. Meanwhile ac-
tive writers, representing minority of the registered users
are using full capacity of LJ system. They are spend-
ing much time participating in LJ community life, so
they have a larger number of incoming and outgoing links
which are distributed by power-law.

The nature of power-law degree distribution can be
explained by continuous evaluation and self-organization
of the LJ network and preferential attachment mecha-
nism similar to WWW growth mechanism [15]. When
someone’s journal attracts attention it will be cited and
promoted in the journals of its readers what will help to
further increase its popularity. Moreover including some-
one as a friend already promotes his journal because users
can check the friends lists in order to ﬁnd similar jour-
nal to the one they like and so inlclude friends of their
friends as their own friends. All together this leads to
“rich-get-richer” eﬀect occurring in many systems[2, 15].
To characterize clustering of the friends of a single
users we calculated clustering coeﬃcient as introduced
by Watts and Strogatz [1, 5]. It is deﬁned as number of
links between user friends divided by the maximum pos-
sible number of links between them. If the user i has ki
friends with Ei links between them the maximum possi-
ble number of directed links is ki(ki − 1) and clustering
coeﬃcient for the user i deﬁned as:

Ci =

Ei
ki(ki − 1)

FIG. 2: Probability distribution of conﬁnement K values for
the users having more than 5 friends.

The average clustering coeﬃcient for the whole network
as calculated from our data is: C = hCiii=1..N ≈ 0.3685.
It is worth to compare it to the clustering coeﬃcient of
random directional network for which is:

Crand =

hki
N

.

(2)

We found Crand ≈ 5.45 · 10−6. The fact that actual
clustering coeﬃcient for LJ network is nearly six orders
of magnitude larger than it would be expected from ran-
domly linked network with the same degree and size is a
clear indication of high users clustering.

Nevertheless clustering coeﬃcient is not quite suitable
for describtion of the local clustering properties since its
values are incomparable for two diﬀerent nodes due to
the high dependence from the absolute number of links
originating from user friends. For example, if the user
A has kA friends and all of them have only one friend
(kout = 1) which is from the A’s friends list the clustering
coeﬃcient will be CA = 1/(kA−1) according to 1. For the
user B with very friendly friends (for example kout = 100)
but having only one friend from B’s friends list clustering
coeﬃcient will be the same CB = 1/(kB −1). If kA = kB,
CA = CB which is hardly describes the actual clustering
situation for this two user groups.

To be able to describe clustering properties of user
groups we are introducing parameter of conﬁnement K
which we are deﬁning as a fraction of links EG between
the members of group G to the total number of links
originating from group members.

To characterize friends clique of a single user the con-
ﬁnement calculations can be applied to the group of his
friends and the user itself, since he is an essential part
of the group. We calculated the conﬁnement distribu-
tion for the LJ network for users having not less than 5
friends and the results are presented on the Fig. 2 with
the mean conﬁnement value hKi = 0.4216.

The peculiar feature of LJ network is the degradation
of direction property. We found that 77.4% of links are

bi-directional which means that this percentage of out-
going links is returned as incoming and vice versa the
same percentage of incoming links originates from close
friends. This is the consequence of social origin of LJ
network. Even if there are no technical reasons for such
a high back connection rate the social rules oblige the
user to respond on his inclusion in someone’s friends list
by including this user in return. Another explanation for
this eﬀect is that often relations in LJ space is based on
a real-life people relations which means that people are
linking to the people which are their friends in real world.
In this case LJ network directly inherits non-directional
structure of social network.

In order to characterize small-world properties of LJ
network we estimated the probability distribution func-
tion Pℓ(ℓ) of the minimum path distance between the
nodes through directional links. The results are pre-
sented on the Fig. 3. The average distance estimated
for this set of data is hℓi = 5.89. According to the gen-
eral approach developed by Newman et al. [6] an average
path length can be estimated using the following expres-
sion:

ℓ =

ln(N/z1)
ln(z2/z1)

+ 1,

(4)

where N is the size of the network and z1 = hkouti and
z2 is the number of the ﬁrst and the second neighbours.
From this we obtained ℓ ≈ 4.2 which is signiﬁcantly
smaller than the value obtained from distribution. We
are considering this as a ﬁrst sign of structure existence
within LJ network.

A number of techniques has been proposed recently for
community ﬁnding within complex networks [16, 17, 18].
Most of them are based on algorithmic optimization of
some quantity determining the clustering of the network.
Here we propose essentially diﬀerent method to ﬁnd
communities based on a simulation of diﬀusion process
in complex network as in multi-dimensional porous sys-
tem with directional links following physical laws. The
diﬀusion process initiated at one of nodes by addition of
the virtual ink produces non-uniform mass distribution
at the intermediate state which can be used to reveal

After start of the diﬀusion process from the initiator virtual
ink propagates through network links. Clusters can be recog-
nized as nodes with similar amount of ink.

well-interconnected communities within complex network
such as LJ users network.

In our model all the connections are treated as pipes
(Fig. 4), directed connection implies pipe which allows
mass to pass in one direction. Mass propagation within
our network system is driven by Flick’s equation of dif-
fusion:

dM = −D

dSdt,

(5)

δφ
δx

where dM is a change of mass, δφ/δx is concentration
gradient and dS is an area element.

For our discrete system this implies that the rate of
mass exchange between neighbouring nodes is propor-
tional to the diﬀerence of masses in these nodes. Every
node uses its outgoing links to deliver mass to its neigh-
bors with smaller amount of ink. The amount of ink
∆outMi delivered to its ith neighbour is:

∆outMi = −

(M0 − Mi),

(6)

α
kout

where α is a coeﬃcient determining the transfer rate and
constant for all nodes. We are using mass M contained
in the node instead of concentration φ assuming that all
nodes have the same volume. The total delivered mass
for a node is the following:

∆outM =

(7)

where M is a mean ink concentration in neighbouring
nodes. Links representing pipes have a zero capacity so
the transfer happens instantaneously. So we can apply

mass conservation law and increase the mass in neigh-
bouring nodes by the amount taken from the node:

∆outM = −

∆inMi

∆inM = −

(9)

The total change of mass at a certain node is composed
of the loss due to diﬀusion to the neighbours through out-
going links and gain by the amount delivered from neigh-
bors through incoming links: ∆M = ∆inM + ∆outM . It
should be pointed out that in a course of calculations ﬁrst
all the mass changes for all nodes are calculated with-
out changing the masses and then changes are applied
to all nodes. For a special case of absence of outgoing
links ∆out = 0 and node acts as a virtual ink absorber
which can only gain ink from neighbours but do not have
ways to deliver it back. Nodes without incoming links are
not considered due to their invisibility for data collecting
crawler and thus absent in our database.

In the beginning we are putting initial amount of ink
M0 = N mass units in one of the nodes which we call ini-
tiator. After this system is allowed to proceed to the equi-
librium state by continuous mass redistribution within
the network according to our rules. The expectation for
an equilibrium state for a connected network system is
an equal distribution of M0 among the nodes so that
each of them has M0/N = 1 mass units. While evolving
into this state system will pass through non-equilibrium
states with non-uniform mass distribution.

Imagine the cluster of well connected nodes inside the
network connected to the outside world only by a few
number of outgoing and incoming links. Initializing the
ink diﬀusion inside the cluster will result in relatively fast
distribution inside the cluster due to the presence of a
large number of exchange channels between the members
(thanks to the small-world of the cluster). Meanwhile
transfer to the outside network is complicated by limited
ﬂow capacity of outgoing channels forming the bottle-
neck for mass delivery. Under these conditions, when the
ﬂow rate between the members is much higher than to
the members and non-members, dispersed ink will likely
form a equi-concentrational volume within the cluster.
If the non-members of the cluster are well connected with
each other the mass distribution process between them is
going to be relatively fast and another volume larger than
the ﬁrst one of equi-concentration will be formed. Each
cluster in this system with speciﬁc connection properties
such as ﬂow rate and distance from the initiator would
have in each of its nodes the same concentration of ink
with the value speciﬁc to the given particular cluster.
Thus by estimating the probability distribution function
of concentration one can analyze non-uniformity of ink
distribution and reveal the separated clusters by deter-
mining the signatures of equi-concentration volumes.

ulation. Values larger than 0.5 are not desirable because
they can cause concentration waves or back-reﬂections in
some cases. For our simulation we were using α = 0.1.

The method proposed does not aim to decompose the
whole network on minimal clusters but to reveal most
obvious clusters within the network. As we are regard-
ing the network as an open system which does not have
to be fully described by existing database we are not as-
signing any parameter to quantify clustering of the whole
network like modularity proposed by Newman [17, 19].
Although we are quantifying isolation of the community
by the parameter of conﬁnement K introduced above.

FIG. 7: Dynamics of virtual ink distribution within LJ net-
work as a logarithmically color coded probability distribution
function of the ink concentration (vertical axis) and simula-
tion step (horizontal axis). Separation of Russian-speaking
community (thin lower line, high concentration values) from
general English-speaking (thicker upper line, lower concentra-
tion values) can be clearly seen.

To test our method we performed ink diﬀusion simu-
lation using our LJ database starting from diﬀerent ini-
tiator nodes. Fig. 5 presents mass decay as a function of
simulation step number T for the ﬂow rates α 0.1, 0.25
and 0.5. The user doctor livsy with the high number of
incoming links was chosen as an initiator node. As we
will show later this user belongs to extremely conﬁned
Russian-speaking community. Inset also shows the same
data rescaled according to α. As one can see from the
match of rescaled curves that dynamics of the process
does not depend from ﬂow rate α in this range. The
striking feature of the data presented is obvious step-like
form of the curves which is an eﬀect of non-homogeneous
structure of the LJ network. Flat parts of the ∆M/M
curves correspond to the exponential decays of M which
are the signs of non-restricted diﬀusion of ink. First sig-
niﬁcant drop of the decay rate happens when T α ≈ 5
which is equal to the double radius of the community to
which our initiator belongs. This corresponds to the mo-
ment when the virtual ink ﬁlls the whole community and
the further expansion of ﬁlled area is impeded by the lim-
ited number of links going outside of the community. So
if it takes T0 simulation steps for an virtual ink to reach
the borders of the community it also takes T0 simulation
steps for the decay of concentration gradient to reach the
initiator node and together this give double size of the
community. Second drop at T α ≈ 22 is not that well
pronounced and corresponds to the ﬁlling of the whole
network.

detection of equi-concentrational volumes we performed

the calculation of probability distribution function of M
on diﬀerent stages of virtual ink diﬀusion for α = 0.1
(Fig.6). One can see two well pronounced peaks on all
plots which occurred to be the Russian speaking com-
munity (larger M ) and the rest of LJ network (broader
peak at smaller M ). Users from particular community
can be revealed by making a crawl starting from some
user within this community with concentration within
the certain range and following directional links to the
users with M from the same range. The fraction of the
users in the cluster discovered by the crawl to the to-
tal number of users with concentration within the range
gives us the speciﬁcity parameter of the method.

Dynamics of concentration distribution is presented on
the Fig.7. As it can be seen a clear separation of the
Russian community peak from the main peak is formed
before the step 1000. After that it is quite stable and
easily distinguishable for up to the iteration 10000 which
gives quite a long quasi-stationary stage which can be
used for communities detection. It also demonstrates the
formation of equi-concentrational node groups is happen-
ing fast in comparison to the whole time of the system
relaxation.

If the initiator node is selected somewhere outside the
community the splitting of the distribution peak is also
observed but for this case average concentration within
the Russian community is smaller than the rest of the
LJ nodes. This supports the expectations that if the
community has a limited number of outgoing links it also
has a lack of incoming links.

The eﬃciency of community discovering scheme can
be improved by simultaneous simulation of the diﬀusion
from two initiator nodes. For this we assigned two inde-
pendent concentration values to a single node. Both dif-

fusion processes are proceeding without inﬂuencing each
other. The LJ network can now be mapped as a probabil-
ity distribution function of two concentrations and so the
community can be localized on two dimensional plane as
shown on the Fig. 8 for a doctor livsy and future visions
as initiator nodes. One can see two main separated peaks
corresponding to major part of LJ network and Russian-
speaking community. The abundance of noise-like spots
on the map corresponds to the small well-separated and
well linked communities existing in the network which
are well localized on the concentrations map.

As the complete analysis of LJ community structure
as well as the reasons of their formation is out of the
scope of the current paper we will not list all found
user cliques. However in the Tab. I we present informa-
tion about largest LJ community and two smaller ones.
Russian-speaking community is formed by the users who
are using Cyrillic letters and it’s size corresponds to the
total number of LJ users from Russian Federation accord-
ing to LJ database [13] (232241 users in January 2006).
The obvious reason for the separation of this community
with very high conﬁnement K = 98.34% is the usage
of Russian language. We found by independent analysis
of info pages and journal entries that 92% of the users

within this cluster are using Cyrillic alphabet. Other
two communities are the examples of surprisingly popu-
lar class of Role-Playing Game communities formed by
virtual users playing characters and writing their journals
on behalf of these characters.

In conclusion, diﬀusion process in essentially non-
euclidean geometry of complex network with clustering
properties leads to a peculiar phenomenon of formation of
quasi-stationary equi-concentrational volumes as shown
by our simulation. This proves to be quite useful for de-
tection of well-interconnected groups of nodes or commu-
nities as we demonstrated on the example of LJ network.
As our method has a O(N ln(N )) complexity (each sim-
ulation step analyzes < kout > N edges and the required
number of steps is proportional to the diameter of the
network which is lnN ) it can be applied for such huge
network as LJ users space and requires one or two hours
of desktop computer time to obtain the results. More-
over this method can be applied locally to the part of the
network even with the lack of information about distant
parts of the network.

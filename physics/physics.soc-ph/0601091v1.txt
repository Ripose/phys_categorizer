Abstract

We investigate three diﬀerent approaches for ﬁtting the degree dis-
tributions of China-, US- and the composite China+US air network,
in order to reveal the nature of such distributions and the potential
theoretical background on which they are based. Our ﬁrst approach is
the ﬁtting with q-statistics probability distribution, done separately in
two regimes. This yields acceptable outcomes but generates two sets of
ﬁtting parameters. The second approach is an entire ﬁtting to all data
points with the formula proposed by Tsallis et al. So far, this trial is
not able to produce consistent results. In the third approach, we ﬁt
the data with two composite distributions which may lack theoretical
support for the moment.

1 Introduction

Studying properties of various types of networks has recently been a trend
in many diﬀerent research ﬁelds [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13].
Nature provides not only large-sized (herein and after the size of a network
refers to the number of nodes within it) networks such as human relationship
network, Internet [7], but also small-sized ones such as air network for a

1

certain country, and food webs [5], etc. For example, the current US air
network is undoubtedly the largest one of the same category in the world.
Even so, its size [14] is only 215 [15], many decades smaller than those of many
artiﬁcial networks which can amount to millions. Obviously, larger networks
are more likely to have better statistics than their smaller counterparts. An
explicit diﬃculty one may encounter in dealing with small-sized networks is
that due to the size limit, the nature of distributions of some key quantities,
for instance degree distributions, may be unclear. It is simply hard for one
to draw any credible conclusions because of the presence of statistical errors.
Hence faced with such situations it is better to resort to possible solutions
rather than ascribe all the faults to the poor statistics.

Loosely speaking, the degree distribution informs us the tendency of how
the whole network is organized. In other words, from the degree distribution
one can have a rough idea of what the network topology may look like. For
instance, if the distribution is Poisson-like or Gaussian-like, we may conjec-
ture that nodes are connected more in a random way, or that any two nodes
in the network are connected with nearly equal probability without any pair
being more favored. If the degree distribution is of scale-free type, then there
probably exists a few hubs with many connections whereas many more nodes
have very small degrees. It was assumed that in the scale-free networks the
rule of the so-called ”preferential attachment” [7] governs the probability that
nodes are connected to one another. Simply put, ”preferential attachment”
means that during the formation of scale-free networks, the highly-connected
nodes have greater chances than the sparsely-connected ones to be connected
by other nodes, which is similar to the phenomenon ”rich gets richer”.

There is at least one common thing in dealing with random- and scale-free
networks, that is, one can mathematically explain the origin of their degree
distributions. For some types of networks, their degree distributions may not
follow the standard distributions as we mentioned above or any other well-
known ones. One good example that can enter here is the air network we
have studied [16, 15]. We ﬁnd that the cumulative degree distributions (to
deal with the statistical errors the cumulative distribution was introduced)
of both China- and US air networks span two distinctive regimes with a
cross-over, similar to double-pareto law [17]. In this case, it would be very
interesting to examine more carefully the real nature of such distributions
[18]. After the ﬁngerprints have been identiﬁed, one may further check how
air networks come into being.

In this paper, we will present three diﬀerent approaches to ﬁtting the

2

degree distribution of China-, US- and China+US air network. Section 2 is
about the ﬁtting based on the probability distribution of q-statistics, which
is done separately in two regimes. Section 3 deals with an entire ﬁtting to
the formula proposed by Tsallis et al. In section 4 ﬁttings of the data to
two composite distributions are given. But the theoretical origin of such
distributions are not yet found. The last section is a brief conclusion.

2 Fitting with Tsallis-Statistics

Composed of a number of airports and ﬂights, air networks are endowed the
following characteristics: (a) quite limited system sizes, being a few hundred
at most; (b) relatively stationary structures with respect to both time and
space; (c) bi-directional ﬂights with slightly ﬂuctuating weights (frequency).
In the terminology of network, the degree k of a certain airport means it has
ﬂights with k other airports in the same network. A very important quantity
related is the distribution of k, p(k), usually called degree distribution, which
gives the probability of ﬁnding an airport connected with exactly k other
airports within the same network.

China air network contains 128 commercial airports, and for US air net-
work, the number is 215. Here we also consider a composite air network
which includes the airports both in China and in US. Hence the composite
China+US air network consists of 343 airports. Besides all the domestic
ﬂights of the two original sub-networks, the newly composed network also
includes a few international ﬂights. Since the number of international ﬂights
is much much smaller than that of domestic ones, the composite network can
be viewed as superposition of two independent sub-networks.

At a glance of the degree distribution of either China air network or US
air network, we would notice that neither of them follows a power-law in a
whole. But cutting the whole curve into two parts from a certain transition
point, we obtain two straight lines on a logarithmic co-ordinate. This means
each single part is a power-law.

Power-law distributions are ubiquitous in nature, such as Zipf’s Law [19],
size distribution of earthquakes [20], energy distribution of solar ﬂares [21]
and so on. A power-law distribution can be expressed as

p(x) = Cx−a,

(1)

where C is the normalization constant and a is the exponent of the law.

3

Power-law is also called scale-free distribution because its shape remains
unchanged whatever we change its scale, whether magnify or decrease. There
are some claimed mechanisms that can generate power-law distributions,
for instance, combinations of exponentials [22], inverses of quantities [23],
random walks and Yule process [24]. Among the numerous types of such
mechanisms there is one theory called self-organized criticality (SOC) ([25]).
In SOC, events occur in the way of avalanches whose sizes can vary from a
few to a million and obey a power-law which can extend to many decades.

Two main reasons may account for our motivation of choosing the prob-
ability distribution of Tsallis statistics to ﬁt the degree distributions of air
networks. First, the air network is not a system which can reach the state of
equilibrium. Like many other complex systems, the air network consists of
many units, between which there are complicated interplays (interactions).
Such systems can not be comfortably treated as simple thermodynamical sys-
tems. Second, as we may have known, Tsallis statistics [26] provides a rather
natural way from information consideration to generate power-law distribu-
tion. As a potential generalization of the conventional Shannon information
theory and the concomitant statistics, the probability distribution of Tsallis
statistics can be written as

p(xi) =

[1 − (1 − q)βxi]

1−q ,

1

1
Zq

(2)

1

where xi is the value of a certain quantity at the state i, Zq =
xi[1 −
1−q is the partition function and q is a positive index. From the
(1 − q)βxi]
observation of degree distributions of air networks, it is rather natural and
straightforward to use the following ﬁtting functions,

P

[1 − (1 − qi)βik]

k[1 − (1 − qi)βik]

1
1−qi
1
1−qi

p(k) =

P

, i = 1, 2

(3)

where q1, β1 and q2, β2 are the parameters for the small k and large k regime,
respectively.

Our ﬁtting using Eq. (3) and the method of least squares has been given
in Fig. 1, where the top-, middle- and bottom panel are for China-, US-
and China+US air network, respectively. Their respective ﬁtting parame-
ter sets (β1, β2) are (0.46±0.005, 2.85±0.01), (0.67±0.003, 3.34±0.02) and
(0.61±0.003, 4.05±0.02). Correspondingly, values of (q1, q2) are (3.16±0.01,
1.35±0.007), (2.49±0.01, 1.30±0.005) and (2.65±0.01, 1.25±0.006). We can

4

see that the three diﬀerent systems have diﬀerent q’s. Also, the slopes of the
two separate lines (logarithmic) for China air network and US air network
are nearly consistent with what we obtained in Refs. [16] and [15].

3 An ambitious ﬁtting approach

In this part, a more ambitious though tougher ﬁtting approach will be given,
adopting the method suggested by Tsallis et al [27]. According to Ref. [27]
we assume that, the solution of the following equation has the tendency
to describe the diﬀerent behaviors of degree distributions at two separate
regimes which meet at a transition point,

dp(k)
dk

= −µrpr(k) − (λq − µr)pq(k),

(4)

with r ≤ q. Here µr, λq, q and r are four parameters which can be determined
through normalization of the degree distribution p(k). It was claimed that
1/(1 − q) and 1/(1 − r) represent the slopes of the two diﬀerent parts of the
degree distributions (logarithmic) respectively. One speciﬁc choice is r = 1
and q > 1. But apparently such an option is not feasible since the slope of
the second line segment is not inﬁnity. What we can only resort to is the
more generic case 1 < r < q, and thereby the solution of Eq. (4) satisﬁes the
following integral equation [27]

k =

1

Z

p(k)

dx
µrxr + (λq − µr)xq .

Further calculation of Eq. (5) using Mathematica leads to [27]

k =

{

−

p1−r(k) − 1
r − 1

λq/µr − 1
1 + q − 2r

1
µr
×[H(1; q − 2r, q − r, (λq/µr − 1))
−H(p(k); q − 2r, q − r, (λq/µr − 1))]},

(5)

(6)

where H(x; a, b, c) = x1+aF ( 1+a
hypergeometric function.

b , 1; 1+a+b

c

; −xbc), with F being the standard

After the above preparations in the theoretical aspects, what is left seems
simply ﬁtting the data to appropriate equations. However, the actual ﬁtting
procedure was not at all smooth and many technic details have to be resolved.

5

Now we have at least three options in choosing which equation is used to
ﬁt the data. Which one, among Eqs. (4), (5), and (6), is more suitable?
Let us start from Eq. (4). Initially one needs to compute the set of ﬁrst
derivatives dp(k)/dk from the data, which is rather trivial. Then one can
readily obtains the values of the four parameters by means of least squares.
The disadvantage is that due to the small number of data points available,
it is hard to establish a solid relationship between dp(k)/dk and p(k), and
the existence of such arbitrariness may greatly hamper the exactness of the
parameters. That is, the ﬁtting error could be rather large so that the ﬁtting
is not ideal. The advantage is the simple, straightforward performance. The
second choice of ﬁtting, by using Eq. (5), is mainly aﬀected by the problem of
singularity. More precisely, certain combinations of values of parameters will
cause the integral kernel on the right-hand side of Eq. (5) to diverge. This
kind of diﬃculty could be avoided by restricting the range of parameters.
But how could we be sure that the ﬁtting has not been aﬀected by doing so?
Lastly, if Eq (6) is employed for ﬁtting, the biggest challenge will be dealing
with the hypergeometric functions which are inﬁnite series. Apparently we
are unable to calculate the sum of inﬁnite series unless we can judge that
it converges. Even if you know the sum is limited, you are still faced with
problems such as how to make a reasonable cut-oﬀ on the series.

So far, our ﬁttings using the method of least squares and the equations in
this section are not able to provide satisﬁable outcomes. One of our ﬁtting
trials on China air network has been shown in Fig. 2. It can be seen that
the ﬁtted curve can not match most of the data points–only the tail is well
ﬁtted, and the ﬁtting of other parts is rather poor. Other combinations of
parameters have also been tried but given no better results. If both the ﬁrst
few points and the tail are included, the intermediate part will deviate from
the curve a lot. It is simply not easy to compromise all diﬀerent parts.

Requested by us, Borges tried in a diﬀerent but less standard way to do
the same ﬁtting with our data. Initially he followed the method in Ref. [27]
to estimate the values of µr, λq, q and r directly from the curves depicting
the original data. Then from Eq. (5) he calculated the values of k as he
treated the values of p(k) as inputs. His ”ﬁtting” results have been shown
in Figs. 3, 4 and 5. But there is still a problem in his ﬁtting. As we can
see from Figs. 3, 4 and 5, the ﬁtting values of r for the three diﬀerent air
networks are all 0.6, less than 1. But r ≥ 1 is required by the method he
used. Also, if we check the curves of degree distributions, we notice that the
slopes of the second parts are apparently larger than 1. If the claim by Ref.

6

[27] that 1/(1 − r) is the slope of the second part is correct, we deduce that
r should be larger than 1. How should we explain the discrepancy between
the theoretical background and his ﬁtting?

4 Fitting approaches using composite distri-

butions

As a matter of fact, Eq. (4) is a sort of composition of two diﬀerent power
laws in the form of diﬀerential equations. Inspired by this approach, we tried
to compose appropriate distributions which could match the entire curves
of the degree distributions. The ﬁrst candidate coming into our mind is
expressed as

p(k) = akr1 + bkr2,

(7)

where the parameters a, r1, b and r2 can be determined from the normaliza-
tion. Initially we intend to combine two power-laws with negative exponents,
that is r1 < 0 and r2 < 0. But the best ﬁtting with Eq. (7) to the data does
not indicate that both are less than 0. The real thing is, if r1 is less than
0, then r2 will be greater than 0. Otherwise, if r1 > 0 is found, then r2 < 0
is obtained. Our ﬁtting using the method of least squares for the three air
networks have been shown in Figs. 6, 7 and 8. From the three ﬁgures we
notice that the heads are all well ﬁtted whereas the transition parts and the
tails do not cooperate. If we check the values of the ﬁtting parameters, we
will ﬁnd that the exponents, that is, -0.2633, -0.4046, and -0.2862 are close
to the slopes of the ﬁrst segment lines of log-log degree distributions for the
three air networks, respectively.

Another distribution we can compose is,

p(k) =

1
akr1 + bkr2 .

(8)

This relationship came to us just by a mathematical consideration in order
to reproduce two regime distributions after the failure of Eq. (7) which did
not show distinctive transition between the lower and higher degree parts.
Eq. (8) has a quite diﬀerent behavior from Eq. (7) and shows a distinctive
transition “knee” like the observed data. It appears from Figs. 9, 10 and
11, that the data is pretty well matched with Eq. (8), by means of least
squares, for all the three networks. In addition, the values of −r1 and −r2

7

nearly represent the slopes of the two separate line segments of the degree
distributions. Take China air network as examples. The ﬁtting parameters
therein are a = 2.022e − 8, r1 = 5.001, b = 0.9376, and r2 = 0.3608. When
0 < k < kc (kc is the degree of the transition point which can be determined
c ), there will be bkr2 ≫ akr1), and hence p(k) ∼ k−r2.
through akr1
When k > kc, then akr1 ≫ bkr2, and hence p(k) ∼ k−r1.

c = bkr2

5 Conclusions

In summary, we have ﬁtted the degree distributions of air network in China,
in US and in China+US in several diﬀerent ways. The ﬁrst approach leads
to two-regime power-laws, each of which can be well described by probability
distribution of Tsallis statistics. However, the ﬁtting generates two q’s, one
for small degree region and another for large degree region. How could we
explain that the value of q is diﬀerent even within the same system? Why
should we divide the whole distribution into two parts? This man-made
separation is apparently arbitrary. Could we thus believe that there exists
diﬀerent hierarchies in the organization of the air networks? As pointed out
by [28], should small airports stay in a group where the law is based on a
certain reference, while the larger airports stay in another one where the law
is based on a diﬀerent reference? The observation is not suﬃcient for us to
arrive at the conclusion that air network is an non-extensive system. The
second type of ﬁtting approach, also based on Tsallis statistics but having a
more generic form, provides the possibility of an entire ﬁtting to all the data
points. But so far, we are unable to come up with any consistent results by
using the method. The third type of ﬁtting approach can help to ﬁnd some
distributions well matched with the data but lacking theoretical background.
That is, how can we derive such distributions from the ﬁrst principle or at
least in a reasonable way?

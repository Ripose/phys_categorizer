Abstract

A bipartite producer-consumer network is constructed to describe the industrial
structure. The edges from consumer to producer represent the choices of the con-
sumer for the ﬁnal products and the degree of producer can represent its market
share. So the size distribution of ﬁrms can be characterized by producer’s degree
distribution. The probability for a producer receiving a new consumption is deter-
mined by its competency described by initial attractiveness and the self-reinforcing
mechanism in the competition described by preferential attachment. The cases with
constant total consumption and with growing market are studied. The following re-
sults are obtained: 1, Without market growth and a uniform initial attractiveness
a, the ﬁnal distribution of ﬁrm sizes is Gamma distribution for a > 1 and is expo-
nential for a = 1. If a < 1, the distribution is power in small size and exponential in
upper tail; 2, For a growing market, the size distribution of ﬁrms obeys the power
law. The exponent is aﬀected by the market growth and the initial attractiveness
of the ﬁrms.

1 Introduction

Industrial structure is an important issue both in macroeconomic and physical
investigations. It is closely related to the dynamics of ﬁrms and market. From
the empirical studies, it has been found that there are several “stylized facts”
related to the processes of industrial evolution. One of them is the skewed
distribution of ﬁrm size which is usually measured by the sales, the number of
employees, the capital employed and the total assets. Such skewed distribution
has usually been described by lognormal distribution since Gibrat[1] and its
upper tail has been described by Pareto distribution or Zipf’s law[2,3]. In terms
of cumulative distribution P>(x) for ﬁrm size x, this states that P>(x) ∝ xµ
for larger x, where µ is the exponent called Pareto index. Recently, there are
more empirical researches investigating the properties of ﬁrm size distribution
in detail[4,5]. Axtell reveals that the U.S. ﬁrm size is precisely described by
power law distribution[6]. For the cumulative distribution of ﬁrm sizes by
employees, the index is 1.059, and for the cumulative distribution of ﬁrm sizes
by receipts in dollars the index is 0.994. Some scholars in Italy and Japan, by
exploring the size distribution of European and Japanese ﬁrms in detail, have
found more evidence for the power law distribution of ﬁrm size in upper tail
including the Zipf law in ﬁrms bankruptcy or extinction[7,8]. All the indexes
for cumulative distributions are ranging around 1 (from 0.7 to 1.2).

Various kinds of power-law behaviors have been observed in a wide range
of systems, including the wealth distribution of individuals[9,10,11] and the
price-returns in stock markets[12,13]. Pareto-Zipf law in ﬁrm size provides an-
other interesting example which exhibits some universal characteristics sim-
ilar to those observed in physical systems with a large number of interact-
ing units. Hence the growth dynamics and size distribution of business ﬁrms
have become a subject of interest among economists and physicists, espe-
cially those who working in econophysics[12]. Together with the works in
macroeconomics[14,15,16], many eﬀorts have been done from the perspectives
of physics in accordance with these empirical facts. Takayasu advanced an
aggregation-annihilation reaction model to study ﬁrm size dynamics[17]. Ax-
tell has argued that complexity approach should be used to deal with the prob-
lem, and agent based modelling together with evolutionary dynamics should
be helpful to understand the formation of power law[18]. Amaral et al. have
studied ﬁrm growth dynamics since 1997[19]. They have developed a stochas-
tic model based on interactions between diﬀerent units of a complex system.
Each unit has a complex internal structure comprising many subunits and its
growth dynamics is dependent on the interactions between them. This model’s
prediction goes well with the empirical result[20,21]. Some other models have
also been presented, which are based on the competition dynamics[22], the in-
formation transition, herd behaviors[23], and the proportional growth for the
ﬁrms’ sizes and the number of independent constituent units of the ﬁrms.[24].

2

The development of the research on complex networks[25,26,27] has given us
a new perspective to speculate the power law distribution of ﬁrm size. First, it
provides us a universal tool for the research of complex systems[28]. Actually,
any complex systems made up by the interactive components can be described
by networks, in which the components are represented by the vertices, and
the interactions by the edges. Second, the empirical results demonstrate that
many large networks in the real world are scale free, like the World Wide
Web, the internet, the network of movie-actor collaborations, the network of
citations of scientiﬁc papers, the network of scientiﬁc collaborations and so
on. They all have a scale-free degree distribution with tails that decay as a
power law (see [27,28] as reviews). So the complex networks in the nature give
us examples of power law behavior. Barab´asi and Albert have argued that the
scale-free nature of real networks is rooted in two generic mechanisms, i.e. the
growth and preferential attachment[29]. We hope the mechanism responsible
for the emergence of scale-free networks would give clues to understand the
power law distribution of ﬁrm size. Actually the network approach has been
already applied to economic analysis. Souma et al. have done some empirical
studies on business networks. The results reveal the possibility that business
networks will fall into the scale-free category[30]. Garlaschelli and Loﬀredo
have argued that the outcome of wealth dynamics depends strongly on the
topological properties of the underlying transaction network[31]. The topology
and economic cycle synchronization on the world trade web have also been
studied[32].

Actually, the dynamics of ﬁrms and market could also be precisely described
by the network approach. We can consider that producers and consumers are
the two kinds of vertices and they are related with each other by links. So
they could be represented as a bipartite network, which includes two kinds of
vertices and whose edges only connect vertices of diﬀerent kinds. The edges be-
tween producers and consumers can stand for the consumers’ choices for their
consumptions. To explore the size distribution of ﬁrms, we assume that every
edge stands for one unit of consumption and the degree of a producer describes
its sales. Then the size distribution of ﬁrms is corresponding to the degree dis-
tribution of producers. As the results of market competition, consumers can
change their choices of the consumption, which refers to the switches of links
between producers. The mechanism of preferential attachment is just a good
description for the rich-getting-richer eﬀect or the self-reinforcing mechanism
in the market competition. So it is a natural way to study the formation of
size distribution of ﬁrms by investigating the evolution of the network.

Bipartite network is an important kind of networks in real world and the col-
laboration networks of movie actors[25,33] and scientists[34] are the typical
ones. The bipartite producer-consumer network we discuss here has diﬀerent
properties compared with the above collaboration networks. The links be-
tween collaborators and acts in collaboration networks are ﬁxed but it can

3

also be rewired with the evolving of the network in the producer-consumer
network model. So the study of producer-consumer network is also valuable
to understand the properties of this kind of bipartite networks.

The presentation is organized as following. In section 2, the model A with
the constant total consumption is discussed, in which producers compete in
a constant market. The results reveal that there is no power law distribution
of ﬁrm sizes in upper tail. In section 3 we investigate the more realistic case
with growing markets. In model B, the number of producers and the market,
which is described by total consumptions, both grow with the time. Led by
the mechanism of preferential attachment, the size distribution of ﬁrms obeys
the power law, and the exponent is aﬀected by the growth and the initial
attractiveness of the ﬁrms. In section 4, we summarize our results and give
concluding remarks.

2 Model A: network evolving with constant total consumption

In the industrial structure, the scale eﬀect of the ﬁrms determined by their
technological levels is one of the factors that inﬂuence the ﬁrm size. Another
one is the self-reinforcing eﬀect in market competition. Assume that there are
N producers and K consumers in the market. They form a bipartite network
and the edges connect the consumers to producers. For simplicity and with-
out losing any generality, we assume one consumer has only one edge which
represents one unit of consumption. The degree of producer describes its size
by means of market share, so the size distribution of ﬁrms is characterized by
the degree distribution of producers. In model A, we consider the situation
with constant total consumption K. The total number of edges will not been
changed, but as the results of competition, the consumer could switch between
producers, which means some edges will be rewired. Then we concentrate on
the ﬁnal steady degree distribution of the model. Let Nk(t) denotes the num-
ber of vertices with degree k at time step t. From any given initial distribution,
the model evolves as following two steps:

1, Cutting one edge randomly at each time step. Let nk(t) indicate the number
of vertices with degree k after cutting one edge at randomly. It is determined
by

nk(t) =

Nk+1(t − 1) + (1 −

)Nk(t − 1)

(1)

k + 1
K

2, Connecting the edge to the producer with preferential attachment mecha-
nism. The probability of connecting the edge to one producer with degree k is:
K−1+N a, where a is a parameter called the initial attractiveness of the node.

k+a

k
K

That is related to the intrinsic competence of the ﬁrm in our discussion. It
is including the technology, the distinctions of the product, and other initial
features of the ﬁrm. Due to the diversity of the demand, we assume any ﬁrm
has the same initial attractiveness without losing any generality. Hence, the
number of vertices with degree k after rewired is:

Nk(t) =

k − 1 + a
K − 1 + Na

nk−1(t) + (1 −

k + a
K − 1 + Na

The eqs.(1) and (2) give the dynamics of network evolution. The boundary
conditions are

These results approve that we have indeed cut one edge in eq.(1) and rewired it
in eq.(2), while the total number of producers and consumers are all constant.

Now we can obtain the stable distribution of ﬁrm sizes by numerical solutions
of the rate equations (1) and (2) with boundary conditions and we have ob-
tained the numerical solutions for the system with total N = 500 producers
and K = 5000 consumers. From any given initial distributions, the system’s
stable distribution is discovered to be related with the parameters. The sim-
ulation results are shown in Figure 1. When a = 0, all the producers have no
initial attractiveness, i.e. their advantages in competition are all from the self-
reinforcing mechanism. The results indicate that many producers fail in the
competition. Almost all consumers connect with few producers. In the case
of a = 1 and for the upper tail in the case of a < 1, the ﬁrm size obeys the

tion. These results are similar with money distribution in ref [9,10] gained by
transferring model. The above results indicate that we can not get power law
distribution by preferential attachment in a constant market. We will discuss
the case of the growing market in the next section.

3 Model B: network evolving with growing market

Model A describes the ﬁrm size distribution in a constant market whose growth
rate is zero. Due to the technical progress and the enlargement of inputs,
averagely, the total demand and supply always grow with the time. So we set
up another model to depicts them as following. At every time step, one new
producer and l new consumers enter the system. The new consumers connect
existing producers with preferential probability. Meanwhile, one old consumer
in the system could still switch between diﬀerent producers. In contrast to
model A, at each evolution step, the number of producers will increase by one
and the number of consumers by l.

Supposing that we have ˜K consumers randomly distributed in ˜N producers in
the initial. There are l consumers and one producer enter the system at every
time step from t = 0. So at time t, we have K = ˜K + lt edges and N = ˜N + t
producers. Let Nk(t) denotes the number of vertices with degree k at time
step t. The network evolves as following:

1, Cutting one edge randomly at each time step. Then the number of vertices
with degree k (nk(t)) is given by

nk(t) =

Nk+1(t − 1) + (1 −

)Nk(t − 1)

k + 1

2, Connecting the one old edge and l new links to producer with preferential

Nk(t) = nk(t) +

These equations give the time evolution of the system of l consumers with one
producer entering the system at every time step.

We have investigated the properties of this model by numerical solutions. With
˜K = 100 consumers randomly distributed among the ˜N = 100 producers in
the initial, the ﬁnal distributions are got by the numerical solutions. If a = 0,
The results are qualitatively the same as the case of constant market. That
is many producers fail in the competition. Almost all consumers connect with
few producers. The frequency distributions for a 6= 0 are shown in Figure 2,
which indicate that the size distribution of ﬁrms obeys the power law and the
exponent is related with the market growth l and the initial attractiveness
a. Larger l leads to less steep slope and bigger initial attractiveness leads to
steeper slope. The exponents range from 1.85 to 2.80.

From our numerical solutions of the model, we have found that the exponential
tails in the numerical results are due to the limited runs of the model. If we
simulate the model for longer time steps, the exponential tail will be moved
to the upper end (as shown in Figure 3). So we believe that when time goes
to inﬁnity, the model with preferential choice of consumption will result in
the power law distribution in the upper tail. The results of the model are

a = 10, l = 10 and the simulation steps are 1000000.

4 Summary

We proposed a bipartite producer-consumer network to investigate the ﬁrm
size distribution in this paper. The market dynamics is described by the evo-
lution of the network and the ﬁrm size is characterized by its market share
which is represented by the degree of producer. The instinct of competition of
the ﬁrms and the self-reinforcing mechanism are introduced into the probabil-
ity of connection and the consumers switch their links between the producers
as for competition. The results indicate that the economic growth is an im-
portant condition for the power law distribution of ﬁrm size distribution. The
growth rate and initial attractiveness of the ﬁrms will aﬀect the exponents
of the ﬁrm size distribution. Without economic growth, our results indicate
that the initial attractiveness of ﬁrms a is an important parameter to deter-
mine the ﬁnal distribution. The ﬁnal distribution is Gamma distribution when
a > 1, is exponential when a = 1. When a < 1, the upper tail is exponential
and the lower end is power. If a = 0, which means only the self-reinforcing
mechanism works in the market competition, there would be only fewer pro-
ducers surviving in the market. All these results provide understandings to the
mechanism of power law distribution of ﬁrm sizes and they maybe valuable
for investigating the properties of bipartite networks.

Abstract

We present a general methodology to incorporate fundamental economic factors
to our previous theory of herding to describe bubbles and antibubbles. We start
from the strong form of Rational Expectation and derive the general method to
incorporate factors in addition to the log-periodic power law (LPPL) signature of
herding developed in ours and others’ works. These factors include interest rate,
interest spread, historical volatility, implied volatility and exchange rates. Standard
statistical AIC and Wilks tests allow us to compare the explanatory power of the
diﬀerent proposed factor models. We ﬁnd that the historical volatility played the
key role before August of 2002. Around October 2002, the interest rate dominated.
In the ﬁrst six months of 2003, the foreign exchange rate became the key factor.
Since the end of 2003, all factors have played an increasingly large role. However,
the most surprising result is that the best model is the second-order LPPL without
any factor. We thus present a scenario for the future evolution of the US stock
market based on the extrapolation of the ﬁt of the second-order LPPL formula,
which suggests that herding is still the dominating force and that the unraveling
of the US stock market antibubble since 2000 is still qualitatively similar to (but
quantitatively diﬀerent from) the Japanese Nikkei case after 1990.

1 Introduction

As an extension of [25], since October 2002, we have posted an analysis of the
US (and later other) markets after the collapse of the “information technology
bubble,” forecasting a continuation of the downward correction, decorated
with ups and downs organized according to a pattern we call “log-periodicity.”
Monthly updates 2 are available from October 31, 2002 till November 17, 2004.

Our projections have been based on the generalization to “bearish” markets
(we call them “antibubbles” when they follow market bubble peaks) of the
concept of positive feedback based on imitation and herding that our team
has demonstrated mostly for bubbles preceding ﬁnancial crashes (see [22] for
a review and references therein).

In December 2004, we decided to discontinue the update, concluding that,
after more than two years, our projections for the US market have not been
veriﬁed, while they have been good from the vantage of foreigners as well
as for other foreign developed markets. In December 2004, we attributed our
failure to forecast the rebound of the market in 2003 to the fact that we had
neglected all factors except the imitation and herding behavior of investors. In
particular, our approach had neglected the fundamental input of the economy
as well as the external manipulations by the Fed and other institutions, the
impact of foreign policy and foreign investors, the dollar eﬀect (all these being
possibly inter-related). Our projections had taken the extreme view that all
these actions are endogenously determined and driven by the collective action
of the investors. We thought this is too simplistic because, in general, one can
understand the evolution of system as the result of an entangled combination of
endogenous organization but also as a response to external news and exogenous
shocks (see [23] for a recent quantitative discussion on the issue of endogeneity
versus exogeneity). In December 2004, we concluded that our live experiment
from Oct. 2002 until Nov. 2004 had clearly demonstrated the limits of this
approximation.

We announced at the web site that we had found a methodology to incorporate
the Feds action and the dollar eﬀect in an extended version of our theory, to
combine our herding theory with all these other factors. The ﬁrst purpose of
the present paper is to present this methodology. We start from the strong
form of Rational Expectation and derive the general formalism to incorporate
factors in addition to the log-periodic power law (LPPL) signature of herding.
Then, our ﬁrst tests show that rational expectation should be partially relaxed
and we present several models combining LPPL with diﬀerent factors (interest

rate, interest spread, historical volatility, implied volatility, exchange rates).
One particularly interesting theoretical result is that this formalism allows
us to justify that the exchange rate factor is equivalent for a certain value
of parameters to take the view of foreigners as empirically discovered in our
monthly updates. We also present several standard statistical AIC and Wilks
tests to compare the diﬀerent proposed factor models.

The most surprising result is in ﬁne that we have to prefer an extension of the
LPPL formula, the so-called second-order LPPL ﬁrst introduced in [24], to all
other possible models including economic factors. We thus present a scenario
for the future evolution of the US stock market based on the extrapolation of
the ﬁt of the second-order LPPL formula.

2 Model 1: Rational Expectation bubble model with a single volatil-

ity factor and log-periodicity

2.1 The stochastic discount factor

The theory of stochastic pricing kernel [4] provides a uniﬁed framework for
pricing consistently all assets under the premise that the price of an asset is
equal to the expected discounted payoﬀ, while capturing the macro-economic
risks underlying each security’s value. This theory amounts to postulating
the existence of a stochastic discount factor (SDF) M that allows one to
price all assets consistently. The SDF is also termed the pricing kernel, the
pricing operator, or the state price density and can be thought of as the
nominal, inter-temporal, marginal rate of substitution for consumption of a
representative agent in an exchange economy. Under an adequate deﬁnition of
the space of admissible trading strategies, the no-arbitrage condition translates
into the condition that the product of the SDF with the value process p(t),
of any admissible self-ﬁnancing trading strategy implemented by trading on a
ﬁnancial asset, must be a martingale:

M(t)p(t) = Et [p(t′)M(t′)] ,

(1)

where t′ refers to a future date. The no-arbitrage condition (1) expresses that
pM is a martingale for any admissible price p. Technically, this amounts simply
to imposing that the drift of pM is zero.

Let us assume as a ﬁrst example the following simple dynamics for the SDF,
which will lead to Model 1 for the price dynamics:

dM(t)
M(t)

= −r(t) dt − φ(t) dW (t) + g(t)d ˆW .

(2)

3

The drift −r(t) of M is justiﬁed by the well-known martingale condition on
the product of the bank account and the SDF [4]. Intuitively, it retrieves the
usual simple form of exponential discount with time. The process φ denotes
the market price of risk, as measured by the covariance of asset returns with
the SDF. Stated diﬀerently, φ is the excess return over the spot interest rate
that assets must earn per unit of covariance with W , hence the negative sign
in front of φ(t) dW (t) in (2) which leads to a positive contribution to the
return µ as we now show. The last term g(t)d ˆW embodies all other stochastic
factors acting on the SDF, which are orthogonal to (uncorrelated with) the
stochastic process dW .

For the sake of pedagogy and clarity, let us provide a straightforward derivation
of Ito’s calculus applied to the condition that the process pM is a martingale.
For this, we form the expectation of

p(t + dt)M(t + dt) − p(t)M(t)
p(t)M(t)

(3)

whose drift (the term proportional to dt) must be zero for the no-arbitrage
condition to hold. This reads

p(t + dt)M(t + dt) − p(t)M(t)
p(t)M(t)

2.2 Price dynamics with rational expectation (RE) and the stochastic dis-

count factor

The price dynamics is written in the standard form

dp
p

= µ(t)dt + σ(t)dW − κdj ,

where dW is the increment of a random walk with no drift and unit variance
and dj is the jump process equal to 0 in absence of a crash and equal to 1
when a crash occurs. The crash hazard rate h(t) is given by

(5)

(6)

Et[dj] = h(t)dt

4

by deﬁnition, where Et[x] denotes the expectation of x conditioned on all
information available at time t.

To obtain the RE price dynamics, we determine µ(t) such that the the process
pM be a martingale, that is, the factor proportional to dt of the last term of
(4)

µ(t) − r(t) − κh(t) − σ(t)φ(t) ,

be zero. This leads to

µ(t) − r(t) = κh(t) + σ(t)φ(t) ,

where we have used that Et[d ˆW ] = 0 = Et[dW · d ˆW ], Et[d ˆW 2] = dt and
(6). The expected price conditioned on no crash/rally occurring (dj = 0) is
obtained by integrating (5) with (8):

For r(t) = φ(t) = 0, L(t) = 1, we recover the previous formulation [11,15,10].

Expression (9) with (10) represents the dynamics of the asset price p(t) as the
results of three contributions:

• the interest rate r(t), which provides as usual the reference background

against which to compare stock market price returns,

• the price volatility σ(t) priced in proportion of the market price of risk
φ(t) of the SDF, the later embodying the positive relation between risk and
return suggested by most asset pricing models [17],

• the crash hazard rate, through another risk-return positive relationship

emerging from the negative price drop associated with a crash.

2.3 Fit with the LPPL model for the crash hazard rate h(t)

Knowing the empirical data of the interest rate r(t) and the volatility, we
use equation (9) with (10) augmented with a model of the crash hazard rate
(and assuming a simple dynamics for φ(t)) to ﬁt the empirical price time series
p(t). In this section, we use the simplest speciﬁcation that φ(t) = φ is constant.
Here, we model the crash hazard rate as explained in [15,10] (for a general
presentation and speciﬁc derivation of the crash hazard rate from herding,
see [22]). In a nutshell, the crash hazard rate is modeled by a log-periodic
power law (LPPL) which captures the intermittent positive feedback during

5

imitation regimes of bubbles before crashes and antibubbles developing after
a bubble. This leads to modeling the integral of h(t) in the exponential term
with the following LPPL formula

κ

t

t0

Z

dτ h(τ ) = B|tc − t|m + C|tc − t|m cos[ω ln |tc − t| − ψ] .

(11)

Putting σ(t) and r(t) to zero retrieves previous works consisting in ﬁtting the
logarithm of the price by the LPPL formula.

Let us rewrite the formula (9) and (10) in the following form

y(t) ≡ ln[p(t)] −

r(τ )dτ = ln[p(t0)] + φ

σ(τ )dτ + κ

where we replace Et0[p(t)] by the realized price p(t). Substitution of Eq. (11)

We use the following procedure.

factor σ(t), which is one of the world’s most popular measures of investors’
expectations about future stock market volatility (that is, risk) 3 .

Using Eqs. (13,14,15), we have ﬁtted the USA S&P 500 price in its antibub-
ble regime since year 2000 (see [25,26,28,30] for previous related works on
the behavior of the market after the crash of March-April 2000) and the re-
sult is shown in Fig. 1. The r.m.s. of the ﬁt residuals is χ = 0.20, which is
very large compared with the pure LPPL ﬁt, showing that Model 1 is a bad
representation of the price.

In addition to the large value of the r.m.s. of the ﬁt residuals, there is another
diagnostic for the bad quality of Model 1: the three diﬀerent contributions
(LPPL, VIX and interest rate r(t)) are large compared with their sum, sug-
gesting the existence of spurious (in the sense of “over-ﬁtting”) compensations
between these terms. In contrast, since the LPPL term was shown to ﬁt very
well the data over the period from 2000 to 2003 [25,26,28,30], the LPPL term
should be the leading contribution while the other factors should have been
perturbations, perhaps growing with time. In other words, Model 1 is not a
perturbation of the LPPL model used previously in [25,26,28,30]. And the
t
t0 r(τ )dτ is given and its
reason for this is that the interest rate contribution
amplitude cannot be modulated within the RE formulation. Since the risk-free
R
interest rate has been always positive, its integral grows with time, given a
contribution with a trend opposite to the overall negative trend of the price
over the period 2000 to 2003; hence, the need for the LPPL contribution to
counter-balance this eﬀect and the ensuing bad ﬁt and probably strong over-
ﬁtting.

3 Model 2: Weaker semi-martingale condition on prices

Generalizing Model 1 to include other factors does not improve, because the
positive contribution of the risk-free interest rate (which is an essential com-
ponent in the RE formulation of the pricing model) requires the other terms
and in particular the LPPL component to adjust to large negative values to
compensate its large positive contribution. The risk-free interest rate turns
out to have an overwhelming and counter trending role in the bearish phase
of the market with declining prices. In the context of the RE formalism, a de-
clining price would then require very strong antagonistic forces to compensate,
leading to unrealistic impacts of other factors and of the LPPL contribution.
Adding other factors do not provide realistic explanations of the price tra-
jectory over this period. We do not show the ﬁts and corresponding ﬁgures

7

obtained with all the factors we have tested, as they teach a lesson similar
to that of Fig. 1. We conclude that it is essentially impossible to obtain a
good model of the empirical price trajectory using the no-arbitrage rational
expectation bubble model enriched with factors such as interest rate spread,
volatility and exchange rates.

We are thus forced to remove the no-arbitrage condition and replace it by a
weaker condition. This amounts to assuming that the market is incomplete.
Indeed, we ﬁnd that the technical source of the problems in ﬁtting the em-
pirical data with our model is the very large cumulative contribution of the
risk-free interest rate r(t). Recall that this contribution comes from the no-
arbitrage condition obtained under a change of probability measure from the
objective to a ‘risk-neutral’ probability measure (a priori distinct from the
objective one), which changes the price process from a semi-martingale into a
martingale [8,9]. We thus propose to change the no-arbitrage condition, which
is equivalent to requiring that the prices are martingales, by the condition
that the prices follow a semi-martingale, with the drift of the semi-martingale
taken proportional to the risk-free rate. In the setting of incomplete markets,
the fair price is not attainable as the particular expectation over a unique risk-
neutral measure, but rather as a supremum over an inﬁnite set of equivalent
martingale measures [16]. Our speciﬁcation for the drift of our semi-martingale
price amounts to reducing the set of equivalent measures as in a variational
set-up. We allow this drift to adjust its amplitude to reﬂect the existence of
price deviations which have not been arbitraged away, possibly due to tech-
nical constraints such as transaction costs and short-sale constraints, but also
because of the reluctance of arbitragers to take risks against the crowd senti-
ments. In other words, the abandon of the no-arbitrage condition reﬂects the
non-fully rational behavior of investors.

The transition to incomplete markets amounts to change (10) into

deﬁne our Model 2, whose ﬁt to the price time series of the the S&P500
already shown in Fig. 1 is presented in Fig. 2. The r.m.s. of the ﬁt residuals is
χ = 0.0482. The improvement of model 2 compared with model 1 is twofold
and very signiﬁcant. First, model 2 better captures the evolution of the S&P
500 index with a much smaller value of the r.m.s. of the ﬁt residuals. Second,
the relative amplitudes of the impact of interest and VIX are much smaller
than in model 1. However, we see that the impact of VIX is still very large
compared with the LPPL factor. This calls for further modiﬁcation of the
model.

4 Addition of other factors

4.1 Description of other potentially relevant factors

The introduction of the price volatility σ(t) in Models 1 and 2 of the previ-
ous section was justiﬁed by the assumed positive relation between risk and
return suggested by most asset pricing models [17]. There is a large empirical
literature that has tried to establish the existence of such a tradeoﬀ between
risk and return for stock market indices. As summarized in [6], the results
have been inconclusive and the relation between risk and return is often found
insigniﬁcant, and sometimes even negative. However, with better monthly vari-
ance estimates based on past daily squared returns, the ICAPM intertemporal
relation between the conditional mean and the conditional variance of the ag-
gregate stock market return has recently been found positive [5]. One possible
reason for the diﬃculties in measuring a positive risk-return relation is that
other state variables in addition to the volatility may inﬂuence the investment
opportunities anticipated by investors [2,21]. In particular, variables related
to the business cycle have been found to predict returns [3]. They include
the dividend-price ratio, the relative Treasury bill rate, the default spread
(diﬀerence between the yield on BAA and AAA-rated corporate bonds, ob-
tained from the FRED database), the Fama-French factors Rm, SMB, and
HML 5 , the exchange rates and so on. The excess return Rm on the market is
calculated as the value-weighted return on all NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ
stocks (from CRSP) minus the one-month Treasury bill rate (from Ibbotson
Associates). SMB (Small Minus Big) is the average return on three portfolios
made of assets with small capitalizations minus the average return on three
portfolios made of assets with big capitalizations. HML (High Minus Low) is
the average return on two value portfolios minus the average return on two
growth portfolios. In addition, determinants of investors’ risk aversion identi-
ﬁed in the asset pricing literature are economic growth prospects, measures of
equity and credit market risk, ﬂuctuations in the exchange rate and negative
news events in other equity markets. If any of these factors are anticipated to
forecast or inﬂuence future returns, they should be incorporated in the return
equation. We thus discuss extensions of Model 2 which incorporate diﬀerent
additional factors as now explained.

4.2 Model 3: Adding the exchange rate factor

The fact that exchange rates (for instance euro/$, i.e., the value of one euro
in dollars) is a relevant factor in the price equation is suggested empirically

5 See the website at http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html

9

by a live experiment to forecast the S&P500 index that we have performed
from Oct. 2002 till Nov. 2004. This experiment led to the suggestion that the
S&P500 index was more predictable when expressed in euros or other major
foreign currencies than in US dollars. The rational for this observation is mul-
tifold. First the conversion of the dollar value of the US stock market into euros
reﬂects more the view point of foreign investors, which constitute a growing
fraction of the population of investors, especially at times of speculative bub-
bles and more generally herding [27], but also due to the growing inﬂuence of
debts at times of bulging US deﬁcits. Second, valuing in euro provides a sim-
ple mean of eliminating (at least in part) the dollar eﬀect resulting from the
policy of the Fed (and in particular its liquidity inputs). Third, the relevance
of the exchange rate as an important factor to forecast returns may reﬂect
the expectation that a lower dollar means a more competitive US economy,
with its many spillovers on market shares, job creation, earnings, investments
and productivity gains and so on. Inversely, a weaker dollar may actually be
worrying because it favors the resumption of inﬂation, higher interest rates
which may slow down the economy, potential loss of conﬁdence of foreign in-
vestors on the sustainability of the US deﬁcits, varying proﬁts for companies
trading internationally and so on. The exchange rate is also responding to
global trade deﬁcit of the US versus the rest of the world. It is often advanced
that the progressive collapse of the US dollar since 2002 is in large part driven
by the growing US deﬁcits (Federal debt, private debt, and current account)
[18]. These eﬀects are in general going in opposite directions but with diﬀerent
time scales.

Let us thus write

p$(t) = peuro(t)eRexch(t) ,
(17)
which deﬁnes the exchange rate return between the dollar and the euro.
Putting for instance peuro = 1 gives the number of dollars equal to eRexch
we obtain from one euro at time t. Now, the risk perceived by the economic
agents is not determined by eRexch(t) or Rexch(t) but by the relative temporal
variations of p$(t)/peuro(t). We have Rexch(t) = ln p$(t) − ln peuro(t) and thus

rexch(t) ≡ dRexch(t)/dt =

dp$(t)/dt
p$(t)

−

dpeuro(t)/dt
peuro(t)

.

(18)

rexch(t) deﬁned in (18) quantiﬁes the real risks due to changes in exchange
rates. Indeed, an investor long in dollars (say, he owns one unit of dollars) has
the equivalent wealth of e−Rexch(t) euros at time t, which becomes e−Rexch(t+dt)
euros at time t + dt. He makes a relative proﬁt or loss (return) in euro equal
to

e−Rexch(t+dt) − e−Rexch(t)
e−Rexch(t)

= −rexch(t)dt .

(19)

Of course, the situation is symmetric for an investor having one euro and mea-
suring his wealth variation in dollars, leading to a proﬁt or loss of +rexch(t)dt

10

over one elementary time step dt.

We thus generalize the market price of risks

φ(t)dW (t) → φdW + ηexchrexch(t)dWexch ,

(20)

where ηexch sets the scale of the impact of the risks associated with the ex-
change rate ﬂuctuations. Note that ηexch can be either positive or negative.
Correlatively, we generalize the price dynamics (5) to make explicit its depen-
dence on the factors identiﬁed in the market price of risks:

dp
p

= µ(t)dt + σexch

p

dWexch + σ(t)dW − κdj .

(21)

]2 + [σ(t)]2 is the sum
The total volatility (variance) of the price returns [σexch
of two contributions, one resulting from the ﬂuctuations associated with the
exchange rate and the other which captures all other factors of uncertainty.
Then, the semi-martingale condition leads to change (8) into

p

µ(t) = αr(t) + κh(t) + γσ(t) + αexchrexch(t) ,

(22)

where αexch = ηexchσexch

Note that γ ≥ 0, while αexch can be of any sign, depending whether the risk
factor is rexch or its negative −rexch. The choice of one or the other amounts to
analyzing the exchange rate from dollars to euros or vice-versa. This symmetry
allows for an a priori arbitrary sign for ηexch.

In words, equation (26) means that the term exp
in (23)
embodying the exchange risk factor is absorbed in the transformation from
dollars to euros. Model 3 thus provides a justiﬁcation for expressing the US
stock market from the view point of the euro as we have done in our monthly
online predictions (our monthly predictions used ˆL(t) = 1). This procedure
is nothing but the particular case (αexch = ηexchσexch
p = 1) of Model 3 which
incorporates the risk factor associated with the exchange rates between the
US dollar and other currencies. By generalizing the description of the US stock
market viewed not solely from the vantage of foreigners, Model 3 allows for
a market price of risk associated with the exchange rate which is not entirely
described in terms of the euro view point.

We implement Model 3 numerically as:

y(t) = A + αr(t) + γv(t) + αexchR(t) + Bf (t) + Cg(t) ,

(28)

y(t) = ln[p(t)] ,

Figure 3 shows the evolution of the S&P 500 index from Aug-20-2000 to Mar-
21-2005 ﬁtted with Model 3. The r.m.s. of the ﬁt residuals is 0.0482. We notice
that this ﬁgure is undistinguishable from Fig. 2. Both model 2 and model 3
gives the same r.m.s. of ﬁt residuals and the ﬁtted parameters are quite close
to each other. In the inset, we see that the impact of the foreign exchange rate
can be neglected. Notwithstanding the decrease of the interest rate during the
antibubble period, which is causally slaved by the market [29], the short term
interest rate has increasing negative impact on the stock market.

From Fig. 3, the impact of interest rate is still very large, we thus ﬁt a modiﬁed
model 3 containing LPPL, VIX, FX but without the interest rate r(t) (forcing
α = 0). The result is shown in Fig. 4. This new ﬁgure emphasizes just the
eﬀect of the FX, without the interfering eﬀect of the interest rate r(t) and
again the impact of VIX can be neglected.

4.3 Model 4: Semi-Martingale bubble model with additional factors

It is natural to extend Model 2 deﬁned by (9) with (23), by adding other
known factors of risks. We explore the relevance of the interest rate spread
and of the historical volatility. This amounts to change (23) into

 L = exp

dτ [αr + γσ + αexchrexch + αhistσhist + αspread(r10y − r3m)]

(30)

(cid:19)

t

t0

(cid:18)Z

where αhist and αspread are two new adjustable parameters. Note again that γ
and αhist are taken positive. r10y − r3m is the diﬀerence in yields between the
Treasury bill with 10 year and 3 month maturities.

Proceeding as before for the OLS ﬁt of this Model 4 to the S&P500 price
trajectory, we obtain Fig. 5. The r.m.s. of the ﬁt residual is 0.0409, which is
smaller than the value 0.0436 of the second-order Landau ﬁt to the same data
set (which was up to now the best, i.e., smallest r.m.s) and of course much
smaller than the r.m.s. 0.0601 of ﬁt residuals using the ﬁrst-order LPPL model.
The inset shows the amplitudes of the contributions of the diﬀerent factors
to the global ﬁt. It shows that, in addition to the LPPL factor previously
considered in [25,26,28,30], the short-term interest rate and the interest rate
spread are the dominant factors, while the other three factors are weaker. The
contribution of σ (or VIX) and the historical volatility are actually completely
negligible since the values of γ and αhist is very small and close to zero.

Notwithstanding the overall quality of this ﬁt shown in Fig. 5, we argue that it
should be disqualiﬁed for the same reasons as discussed in section 2.3 concern-
ing Fig. 1: the spread and interest rate contributions are quite large, which
forces the LPPL contribution to increase with time. This LPPL contribution
thus exhibits a trend opposite to the initial simple LPPL ﬁt and, therefore,
Model 4 cannot be considered as a perturbation to the simple LPPL model.

4.4 Second-order Landau formula

An extension of the LPPL formulas (11) and (12) described in section 2.3
has been proposed in [24], based on a formulation of the critical power law
behavior in terms of a Landau-like expansion

dF (τ )
d ln τ

= αF (τ ) + β|F (xτ )|2F (τ )... ,

(31)

where the coeﬃcients are generally complex and τ = |t − tc. Keeping only the
ﬁrst term αF (τ ) of the right-hand-side of (31) with α = m + iω retrieves (13)
without the term φv(t), which is the so-called ﬁrst-order LPPL formula [22].

13

Including the second-order term β|F (τ )|2F (τ ) leads to [24]

which was used to model the bubbles before the USA 1929 crash and 1987
crash [24]. A third order LPPL formula was used to model the nine-year Nikkei
antibubble since January 1990 and predict the ensuing two-year evolution
[13,14].

Equation (32) predicts the transition from the angular log-frequency ω + ∆ω
for ∆t < |t − tc| to the angular log-frequency ω close to tc. This corresponds
to an approximate description of a log-frequency modulation. For instance,
the 1990 Nikkei antibubble studied in [13,14] experienced the transition from
the ﬁrst-order Landau description (11) and (12) to the second-order Landau
formula (32) approximately 2.5 years after the inception of the antibubble
[13,14]. In contrast, the 2000 S&P 500 antibubble was found to just barely
enter the second-order Landau regime on the fourth quarter of 2003 after more
three years since its inception [30], while the second-order Landau regime was
undetectable from data ending in the last quarter of 2002 [26].

In the following tests, we compare between them the diﬀerent models con-
structed with diﬀerent factors and with the second-order LPPL formula (32).

5 Tests on the relevance of the diﬀerent factors

Let us consider the family of one-factor LPPL models deﬁned by

 L = exp

αifidτ

, with i = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5,

(33)

t

t0

(cid:18)Z

(cid:19)

where α1f1 = αr, α2f2 = γσ, α3f3 = αexchrexch, α4f4 = αhistσhist, and α5f5 =
αspread(r10y − r3m). We ﬁt the S&P 500 antibubble after the burst of the “new
economy” bubble in April of 2000 using each of the ﬁve models deﬁned by
Eq.(33). The time series is ﬁtted from Aug-20-2000 to a time tlast which is
varied from 08-Apr-2002 to 10-Mar-2005 with a step of 21 trading days. Each
interval from Aug-20-2000 to a time tlast is ﬁtted by each of the ﬁve models.

14

5.1 Akaike’s AIC criterion

To compare these ﬁve models with the ﬁrst-order LPPL and second-order
LPPL, we use Akaike’s minimum AIC estimation [1], which was designed for
the identiﬁcation of several competing models. The AIC is deﬁned by

AIC = −2 ln(L) + 2κ ,

(34)

where L is the maximum likelihood of a given model given the data and κ is the
number of independently adjusted parameters within a model. By assuming a
Gaussian distribution of the ﬁt residuals, we have

ln L = −n ln(ˆσ) −

[ln(2π) + 1] ,

(35)

n
2

where n is the number of data points and ˆσ2 = χ2 is the maximum likelihood
estimate of the variance of the ﬁt residual.

The top panel of Fig. 7 shows the evolution of the AIC’s of the ﬁve one-factor
LPPL models in comparison with the ﬁrst- and second-order Landau LPPL
models. To better illustrate the competition among the models, we plot the
relative AIC with respect to the ﬁrst-order LPPL model in the lower panel of
Fig. 7. This ﬁgure suggests that the historical volatility played the key role
before August of 2002. Around October 2002, the interest rate dominated. In
the ﬁrst six months of 2003, the foreign exchange rate became the key factor.
Since the end of 2003, all factors have played an increasingly large role. Note
also that after July 2003, the second-order Landau LPPL model has the largest
AIC and is identiﬁed as the best model, suggesting as discussed elsewhere
[25,30] a progressive maturation of the herding eﬀect in this “antibubble,”
similarly to the case of Japan [12,14].

We should stress however that this qualitative similarity between the US an-
tibubble since 2000 and the Japanese antibubble since 1990 does not extend
to the quantitative level. In [26] written in 2003, we stated that we could
not ﬁnd neither quantitative nor qualitative diﬀerences between the US and
the JP antibubbles. Things have changed in the last two years. Our present
analysis shows that the second-order LPPL regimes of the two antibubbles
are quite diﬀerent; for instance, the important parameter ∆ω have diﬀerent
signs and signiﬁcantly diﬀerent values; the ∆t ’s are also very diﬀerent. We
conjecture that these quantitative diﬀerences may signal deep divergences in
the mechanisms and evolutions of the two antibubbles in the present regime
described by the second-order LPPL model and beyond.

15

5.2 Wilks’ test of embedded hypotheses

Since the single factor models deﬁned with expression (33) contain Model
1 deﬁned by (13) as a special case αi = 0, we can use Wilks theorem [20]
and the statistical methodology of nested hypotheses to assess whether the
hypothesis that αi = 0 can be rejected. By assuming a Gaussian distribution
of observation errors (residuals) at each data point, the maximum likelihood
estimation of the parameters amounts exactly to the minimization of the sum
of the square over all data points (of number n) of the diﬀerences δj(i) between
the mathematical formula and the data [19]. According to Wilks theorem of
nested hypotheses, the log-likelihood-ratio

T = −2(L0 − L1) = 2n(ln σ1 − ln σ0) ,

(36)

is a chi-square variable with k degrees of freedom, where k is the number of
restricted parameters [7]. In the present case, we have k = 1. The Wilks test
thus amounts to calculate the probability that the obtained value of T can
be over-passed by chance alone. If this probability is small, this means that
chance is not a convincing explanation for the large value of T which becomes
meaningful. This implies a rejection of the hypothesis that αi = 0 is suﬃcient
to explain the data and favor the ﬁt with αi 6= 0 as statistically signiﬁcant.

Figure 8 plots the evolution of the probability Pr that the log-likelihood-
ratio exceeds T at tlast. The second-order Landau formula is also tested for
comparison. We see that there are always factors that are signiﬁcant at a level
of signiﬁcance far better than 99%, that is, Pr < 1%. For instance, α4 6= 0
(historical volatility) passed the test in the time period before August of 2002.
Since 2004, all ﬁve one-factor models and the second-order Landau model are
signiﬁcant.

It is noteworthy that the second-order Landau formula experienced a tran-
sition from large Pr to small Pr in the ﬁrst quarter of 2003, signaling the
crossover from the ﬁrst-order Landau regime to the second-order regime, which
conﬁrms our earlier preliminary assessment [30]. In contrast, the one-factor
models exhibit large values of Pr for several months in 2003.

Together with the fact that the r.m.s. of the residues of the ﬁt is the smallest
for the second-order LPPL formula (32), we conclude that the second-order
LPPL model is the best model. The economic factors investigated here seem
less powerful than just herding eﬀects to account for the continuation of the
unraveling of the US stock market antibubble.

16

6 Prediction using the second-order LPPL formula (32)

So far, we have shown that the macroscopic factor models are not as good as
the second-order formula. For the US S&P 500 antibubble started in August
2000, the second-order formula (32) provides by far the best model so that
the other factors cannot explain what is going on in the US stock market. Our
analysis also shows that the antibubble has entered the second-order Landau
regime approximately during the summer of 2003, conﬁrming our preliminary
analysis [29]. In addition, the tests in [29] showed that, in the framework of the
ﬁrst-order Landau model, the antibubble was probably still alive in August
2003 but has ended since in the USA (i.e., when viewed from the view point of
a US investor valuing in US dollars). The timing of the end of the ﬁrst-order
LPPL antibubble is roughly consistent with our current analysis.

To further show that the crossover happened in 2003, we show in Fig. 9 the
evolution of the ﬁtted values of ∆t and ∆ω which are the diagnostic of the
relevance of the second-order formula. The dramatic drop of the value of ∆t
endorses the crossover from the ﬁrst-order regime to the second-order.

These tests suggest that it is possible to resume the modeling and prediction of
the antibubble within the second-order Landau model. Fig. 10 shows the ﬁt of
the US S&P 500 index from 2000/08/21 to 2005/03/21 using the second-order
Landau formula. The ﬁtted inception date of the antibubble tc = 2000/08/17 is
found stable in all our ﬁts with diﬀerent terminal values of the ﬁtted windows.
The extrapolation of the ﬁtted second-order formula shown in Fig. 10 suggests
that the market is not yet ready for a solid recovery.

Fig. 6. Fit to the modiﬁed model of all factors except the interest rate. The values of
the ﬁt parameters are the following: tc = 2000/07/16; m = 0.80, ω = 5.44, ψ = 4.17,
γ = 0, αhist = 9.11 × 10−7, A = 7.39, αspread = 1.54 × 10−2, αexch = −0.182,
B = −3.23 × 10−3, and C = 5.84 × 10−4. The r.m.s. of the ﬁt residuals is 0.0517.
The inset shows the impact of diﬀerent factors contributing to the overall ﬁt of
Model 4. The LPPL factor is reduced or translated by the amount of A for a better
comparison.

Fig. 8. Wilks’ log-likelihood-ratio test of the signiﬁcance of the new factors intro-
duced in (33). The second-order Landau formula is also tested. Note that all values
of Pr which are less than 0.001 are plotted to be 0.001 in the ﬁgure for better
representation.

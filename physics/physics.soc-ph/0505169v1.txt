A network-based ranking system for US college football

American college football faces a conﬂict created by the desire to stage national

championship games between the best teams of a season when there is no conven-

tional playoﬀ system to decide which those teams are.

Instead, ranking of teams

is based on their record of wins and losses during the season, but each team plays

only a small fraction of eligible opponents, making the system underdetermined or

contradictory or both. It is an interesting challenge to create a ranking system that

at once is mathematically well-founded, gives results in general accord with received

wisdom concerning the relative strengths of the teams, and is based upon intuitive

principles, allowing it to be accepted readily by fans and experts alike. Here we

introduce a one-parameter ranking method that satisﬁes all of these requirements

and is based on a network representation of college football schedules.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Inter-university competition in (American) football is big business in the United States.

Games are televised on national TV; audiences number in the millions and advertising

revenues in the hundreds of millions (of US dollars). Strangely, however, there is no oﬃcial

national championship in college football, despite loudly-voiced public demand for such a

thing.

In other sports, such as soccer or basketball, there are knockout competitions in

which schedules of games are drawn up in such a way that at the end of the competition

there is an undisputed “best” team—the only team in the league that remains unbeaten. A

simple pairwise elimination tournament is the most common scheme.

The diﬃculty with college football is that games are mostly played in conferences, which

are groups of a dozen or so colleges chosen on roughly geographic grounds.

In a typical

season about 75% of games are played between teams belonging to the same conference. As

a result there is normally an undisputed champion for each individual conference, but not

enough games are played between conferences to allow an overall champion to be chosen

2

unambiguously. Some other sports also use the conference system, and in those sports an

overall champion is usually chosen via a separate knockout tournament organized among

the winners and runners up in the individual conferences. In college football, however, for

historical and other reasons, there is no such post-season tournament.

To fulﬁll the wishes of the fans for a national championship, therefore, several of the

major conferences have adopted a system called the Bowl Championship Series (BCS,

www.bcsfootball.org), in which one of four existing post-season “bowl games”—the Rose,

Sugar, Fiesta, and Orange Bowls—is designated the national championship game on a ro-

tating basis and is supposed to match the top two teams of the regular season [2]. (For the

2004 season it was the Orange Bowl; in the upcoming 2005 season it will be the Rose Bowl.)

The problem is how to decide which the top teams are. One can immediately imagine many

diﬃculties. Simply choosing unbeaten teams will not necessarily work: what if there are

more than two, or only one, or none? How should one account for teams that play diﬀerent

numbers of regular-season games, and for “strength of schedule”—the fact that some teams

by chance inevitably play against tougher opponents than others? What about margins of

victory? Should a decisive victory against your opponent count for more than a narrow

victory? Should home games be counted diﬀerently from away games?

A number of diﬀerent strategies have been devised to rank teams, including polls of

knowledgeable human judges and computer algorithms. Currently the ﬁnal decision is made

using a weighted composite score called the BCS ranking that combines a portfolio of diﬀer-

ent polls and algorithms to give a single measure of the strength of each team. The formula

used changes slightly from year to year, but the most recent version is one that averages

two human polls (one of them, the Associated Press (AP) poll, has opted out of the system

starting from the 2005 season) and six computer algorithms.

In this paper we focus on

computer ranking algorithms.

Because there are many diﬀerent parameters and considerations that could enter into a

ranking system, many systems have been proposed [1, 4, 6, 8], and there is no consensus

about which is the best [10]. Moreover, there is considerable unhappiness about the current

BCS system [11] and hence plenty of room for innovation. We here present a new method

of ranking based on a mathematical formulation that corresponds closely to the types of

arguments typically made by sports fans in comparing teams. Our method turns out to

be equivalent to a well-known type of centrality measure deﬁned on a directed network

representing the pattern of wins and losses in regular-season games.

II. DEFINITION OF THE METHOD

Perhaps the simplest measure of team standing is the win-loss diﬀerential, i.e., the number

of games a team wins during the season minus the number it loses. (In American football

there are no tied games—games are extended until there is a winner.) Indeed, the win-loss

diﬀerential is almost the only measure that everyone seems to agree upon. It is unfortunate

therefore that in practice it correlates rather poorly with expert opinions about which teams

are best, for many of the reasons cited in the previous section, such as variation in strength

of schedule. As we show here, however, we can correct for these problems, at least in part,

by considering not just direct wins and losses, but also indirect ones.

One often hears from sports fans arguments of the form: “Although my team A didn’t

play your team C this season, it did beat B who in turn beat C. Therefore A is better than

C and would have won had they played a game.” (See Fig. 1.) In fact, the argument is

usually articulated with less clarity than this and more beer, but nonetheless we feel that

the general line of reasoning has merit. What the fan is saying is that, in addition to a real,

physical win (loss) against an opponent, an indirect win (loss) of the type described should

also be considered indicative of a team’s strength (weakness). It is on precisely this kind of

reasoning that we base our method of ranking.

A. The college football schedule as a network

The schedule of games for a season can be represented as a network or graph in which

the vertices represent colleges and there is an edge between two colleges if they played a

regular-season game during the season of interest [3]. Furthermore, we can represent the

winner and loser of each game by making the network directed. We place an arrow on each

edge pointing from the winner of the corresponding game to the loser. An example of such

a network, for the 2004 season, is shown in Fig.2. (The direction of the arrows is a matter of

convention; we could have made the opposite choice had we wished and the network would

still contain the same information.)

Direct losses and wins of a team in this network correspond to edges running directly to

and from that team, and indirect losses and wins, as deﬁned above, correspond to directed

paths of length 2 in the network, to and from the team.

A particularly nice property of these indirect wins is that a direct win against a strong

opponent—a team that has itself won many games—is highly rewarding, giving you auto-

matically a large number of indirect wins. Thus, when measured in terms of indirect wins,

the ranking of a team automatically allows for the strength of schedule.

And there is no need to stop here: one can consider higher-order indirect wins (or losses)

of the form A beats B beats C beats D, and so forth. These correspond to directed paths in

the network of length three or more. Our proposed ranking scheme counts indirect wins and

losses at all distances in the network, but those at greater distances count for less, because

we feel it natural that a direct win against a team should count for more than the mere

supposed victory of an indirect win.

Mathematically, we can express these ideas in terms of the adjacency matrix A of the

network, an n×n real asymmetric matrix, where n is the number of teams (117 for Division I-

A in the 2004 season), with element Aij equal to the number of times team j has beaten

team i (usually 1 but occasionally 2). The number of direct wins for a team can be written

direct wins for team i =

Aji,

Xj

and the number of indirect wins at distance 2 (A beats B beats C) as

indirect wins at distance 2 for team i =

AkjAji,

FIG. 2: A graphical representation of the regular season schedule of division I-A teams in 2004.

Teams are divided up by conference (A = Atlantic Coast, E = Big East, X = Big Ten, B = Big XII,

C = Conference USA, M = Mid-American, P = Pac Ten, W = Mountain West, S = Southeastern,

T = Sun Belt, T = Western Athletic, I = Independent). Directed edges point from winners to

losers.

and so forth. We discount indirect wins over direct ones by a constant factor α for every level

of indirection, so that an indirect win two steps removed is discounted by α2, an indirect win

three steps removed by α3, and so forth. The parameter α will be the single free parameter

in our ranking scheme.

We now deﬁne the total win score wi of a team i as the sum of direct and indirect wins

at all distances thus:

wi =

Aji + α

AkjAji + α2

where kout

is the out-degree of vertex i in the network—the number of edges leading away

from the vertex. When written in this fashion, we see that the win score can also be viewed

another way, as a linear combination of the number of games a team has won (the out-degree)

and the win scores of the other teams that it beat in those games.

Similarly the loss score li of a team is

Now we deﬁne the total score for a team to be the diﬀerence si = wi−li of the win and loss

scores. Teams are then ranked on the basis of their total score. With this ranking scheme,

a win against a strong opponent—one with a high win score—rewards a team heavily, while

a loss against a weak opponent—one with high loss score—has the exact opposite eﬀect.

Thus, as discussed above, our ranking scheme automatically incorporates the strength of

schedule into the scoring.

Equations (3) and (4) can conveniently be rewritten in vector notation, with w =

(w1, w2, . . .), l = (l1, l2, . . .), kout = (kout

1, kout

2, . . .) and kin = (kin

1, kin

2, . . .), giving

w = kout + αAT · w,

l = kin + αA · l,

or, rearranging,

w =

I − αAT
(cid:0)

(cid:1)

−1 · kout,

l =

I − αA
(cid:0)

−1 · kin.
(cid:1)

These formulas are closely related to those for a well-known matrix-based network centrality

measure due to Katz and others [5, 9], and our method can be regarded as a generalization

of the Katz centrality applied to the network representation of the schedule of games.

B. The parameter α

TABLE I: λmax and λ−1

max at the end of the regular season.

Before applying our method we need to choose a value for the parameter α that appears

in Eqs. (3) and (4). A larger value of α places more weight on indirect wins relative to direct

ones while a smaller one places more weight on direct wins. (For the special case α = 0 only

direct wins count at all and the total score for a team is simply the win-loss diﬀerential.)

There are, in general, limits to the values α can take. It is straightforward to show that

the series in Eqs. (3) and (4) converge only if α < λ−1

max, where λmax is the largest eigenvalue
of the adjacency matrix A. If the network is acyclic—has no loops of the form A beats B

beats C beats A or longer—then the largest eigenvalue is zero (as indeed are all eigenvalues)

and hence there is no limit on the value of α. This however is an unlikely situation: there has

never yet been a season for which there were no loops in the network. Normally therefore

there is a ﬁnite upper bound on α. Historically the values of this upper bound have been

in the range 0.2 to 0.3 (Table I), so an indirect win cannot count for more than a ﬁfth

to a third of a direct win. However, the number of indirect wins is in general greater the

farther out we go in the network, i.e., the higher the level of indirection. This means that

the indirect wins can still make a substantial contribution to a team’s score because of their

sheer number. An α close to the upper bound gives roughly equal contributions to a team’s

score from indirect wins at all distances.

Aside from the limit imposed by the requirement of convergence, α is essentially a free

parameter, and diﬀerent values will yield diﬀerent ﬁnal rankings of teams. As a simple

criterion for judging which values are best, we calculate the rankings of all teams and then

ask what fraction of all games in a season are won by the team with the higher ranking.

The results are shown as a function of α for each of the years for which the BCS has existed,

1998–2004, in Fig. 3. We see that for a broad range of values of α our method ranks winners

above losers about 80% of the time—a pretty good average—and the best results appear for

values of α around 0.8 of the maximum allowed value. Thus a simple strategy would be just
to choose α = 0.8 λ−1

max.

While this strategy appears to give good results in practice, it has one problem, namely

that the calculation of λmax (and hence of α) requires a knowledge of the entire directed

network, which means that we can only perform the calculation after the end of a season

once the outcome of every game has been decided. In practice, however, one often wants

to rank teams before the end of the season, for instance to calculate weekly standings from

partial results as the season progresses. Thus we would like to be able to decide the value

of α before the start of the season. In the next section we provide a method for doing this

that appears to work well.

C. An algorithm for choosing α

As discussed in the preceding section, the limit λ−1

max on α would be inﬁnite were there no
loops in the network. Only if there are loops (which there usually are) does the limit become

ﬁnite. And in general the more loops there are the lower the limit. (The combinatorial

explosion in the combinations of loops that paths can circulate around makes the number of

paths increase faster with path length when there are more loops, and this then requires a

lower value of α to ensure convergence.) Real schedule networks have fewer loops than one

would expect on the basis of chance, precisely because teams do vary in strength which gives

rise to networks that are close to being acyclic. Thus we would expect the value of λmax to
be lower and the limit λ−1

max to be higher in a real network than in a network with randomly

assigned edges. (As a check, we have performed Monte Carlo randomizations of the edge

directions in the real networks and ﬁnd that indeed λmax consistently increases when we do

this.) This provides us with way to calculate a safe and practical upper bound on the value

of α without knowledge of game outcomes: we simply calculate the limit for a network with

randomly assigned outcomes.

It is straightforward to calculate the largest eigenvalue for a random directed network

in which the distribution of in- and out-degrees is known. Let P (kin = i, kout = j) be the

joint probability distribution of in- and out-degrees. The largest eigenvalue is equal to the

factor by which the number of paths of a given length starting at a vertex increases when

we increase that length by one, in the limit of long path length. But this is simply equal

to the mean out-degree of the vertex reached by following a randomly chosen edge in the

graph, which is given by [7]

ij ijP (kin = i, kout = j)
ij iP (kin = i, kout = j)

=

hkinkouti
hkini

.

P
P

For our random network, the joint degree distribution is derived by randomly assigning

directions to edges on an initially undirected network whose degree distribution is given by

the distribution of the number of games played by the teams in the regular season. Let us

denote this distribution pk. Then

P (kin = i, kout = j) = 2−(i+j)

where hki and hk2i are the mean and mean-square number of games played by a team in

the season of interest.

As a test of this calculation we have calculated numerically the actual values of λmax

for simulated seasons with randomly assigned wins and losses. The results are shown in

Table II. As the table shows, agreement between the analytic calculation and the simulations

is excellent.

All the values of λmax in Table II are larger by about 20% than the actual λmax for the

corresponding season (Table I), precisely because actual wins and losses are not random,

but reﬂect the real strengths and weaknesses of the teams. But this means that the random-

graph value of λmax imposes a limit on α that will in general be about 0.8 of the limit derived

from the true ﬁnal schedule network incorporating the real wins and losses. And this value

is right in the middle of the region found in the preceding to section to give the best rankings

11

(10)

of the teams. Thus an elegant solution to the problem of choosing α emerges. We simply

choose a value equal to the limiting value set by Eq. (9):

α =

2hki
hk2i − hki

.

This guarantees convergence, requires no knowledge of the eventual outcome of games, and

appears to give optimal or near-optimal rankings under these constraints. This then is the

value that we will use in the calculations in this paper.

D. Comparison to the BCS rankings

We now compare the results of our method to the oﬃcial BCS ranking results.

It is

worth pointing out that agreement with the oﬃcial rankings is not necessarily a sign of

success for our method. If our method were better in some sense than the oﬃcial method

(for example in comparison with the opinions of human expert judges), then necessarily the

two methods would have to disagree on some results. Nonetheless, since the BCS ranking

is, by common consent, oﬃcially the collective wisdom, it is clearly of interest to see how

our method compares to it.

First, in Table III we show the rankings calculated from our method and from the BCS

computer algorithms for the top 25 BCS teams of 2004. The value of α for 2004 from

Eq. (10) is 0.207, or about 0.763 of the maximum.

Even from a casual inspection it is clear that there is a reasonable match between our

rankings and the oﬃcial ones. For instance, the correlation coeﬃcient between the two sets

of rankings is is 0.90. This is good news: the rankings are in basic agreement on the overall

picture. Among these 25 teams, our method classiﬁed two—Pittsburgh and Florida—to be

outside the top 25. Interestingly, these same teams were also ranked outside the top 25 by

all the BCS computer algorithms except the Billingsley algorithm. Furthermore, none of

the other computer polls does any better at predicting the ﬁnal top 25—each gets at least

two wrong. Other points of interest are the ranks of the Universities of Auburn, Texas,

and California. Auburn, although undefeated in the regular season, did not participate in

a championship game because it was consistently ranked third in all polls, and our method

concurs. Texas and California played very similar seasons but both human polls ranked

California to be higher, while all the computer polls said the reverse. Our method lines up

with the computer polls in this respect.

In Table IV, we compare the top ﬁve BCS teams for each year (with α again selected as

described in Section II C and taking values typically between 0.7 and 0.85 of the maximum

III. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have introduced a ranking system for division I-A American college

football based on a common-sense argument frequently made by sports fans (and not limited

to American football). The method has an elegant mathematical formulation in terms of

networks and linear algebra that is related to a well-known centrality measure for networks.

The method has one free parameter and we have given empirical evidence indicating the

typical range of the best values for this parameter and a method for choosing a speciﬁc value

14

in any particular case.

Applying our method to the seven years during which the BCS ranking scheme has ex-

isted, we ﬁnd excellent agreement between the method and the oﬃcial rankings but with

some deviations, particularly in well-known controversial cases. We believe that the com-

bination of sound and believable results with a strong common-sense foundation makes our

method an attractive ranking scheme for college football.

Finally, we would like to comment on the generalizability of our method. The method

lends itself readily to the addition of other elements, such as margin of victory, home-ﬁeld

advantage, progress of the season, and so forth: these could be introduced as modiﬁers on

the weights of the edges in the network, and it would be interesting to see how these aﬀect

the outcome of the method. However, we believe that the very simplicity of the current

method, with its single parameter, is a substantial advantage, and that simplicity should be

encouraged in these types of mathematical methods. A method such as ours reduces the

extent to which the calculations must be tuned to give good results while at the same time

retaining an intuitive foundation and mathematical clarity that makes the results persuasive.

[11] It was originally hoped that the BCS rankings would help generate consensus about the true

number 1 and 2 teams, resulting in an undisputed national champion, but it hasn’t always

worked out that way. Most recently in 2003, for instance, the AP poll awarded its top spot to

the University of Southern California, contradicting the overall BCS rankings, which awarded

top honors to the Louisiana State University, and resulting in a “split” national title of the

kind the system was designed to avoid.

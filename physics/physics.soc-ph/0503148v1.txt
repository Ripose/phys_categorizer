We introdue a metris to the random network of the human relationships. Obtained

spatial graph allows us to alulate the average separation of people in a very simple

manner. Aquired results agree with the well-known presene of the small-world

phenomenon in human relationships. It indiates that this feature an be understood

merely as the onsequene of the probability omposition. We will also examine how

this phenomenon evolves with the development of the human soiety.

Key words: Small-world phenomenon, random networks, spatial graphs,

onvolution.

Introdution

In random networks we often observe small world phenomenon (SWP). In this

ase, the network has small average distane between its verties together with

large value of the average lustering oe(cid:30)ient. Then it is alled small world

network (SWN).

Suh a ase was (cid:28)rst notied by the soial psyhologist Stanley Milgram in

the 1960s. He examined how people know eah other and introdued quantity

named degree of separation D . It is number of people needed to bind two
hosen persons via the hain of aquaintanes. E. g. if persons A and B do not
know eah other, but they have ommon friend C , their degree of separation
is D(A, B) = 1. He measured mean degree of separation between people in
= 6. This gave another name to

D

USA and found surprisingly small value h

i

this phenomenon (cid:21) "six degrees of separation".

It is lear that to say "to be an aquaintane" is somewhat vague. There are

various options (cid:21) e. g. shaking eah others hand, talking to eah other for

at least one hour, et. Fortunately, results do not depend signi(cid:28)antly on the

spei(cid:28) hoie, we observe SWN in every ase. In spite of this, number six

in the name of the phenomenon an not be taken literally. Atually it is an

expression for the number, whih is small omparing to the size of population,

whih is taken to be 6 400 millions (approximate number of people on the

Earth) in this artile.

Nowadays, SWP is the well known feature of various natural and arti(cid:28)ial ran-

dom graphs [1℄. E. g. artile itations, World Wide Web and neural networks

exhibit this feature [2,3℄.

There are many ways to onstrut the SWN. Some models are rather math-

ematial and do not examine the mehanism of origin of a network, instead

of this they impose some heuristi rules (e. g. [4,5,6℄). Other models look for

the reasons of introdued rules (cid:21) this is more satisfatory from the physiist's

point of view. The (cid:28)rst suh model is known as preferential linking [7℄. It is

quite reasonable e. g. for the growth of the WWW, where sites with many

links to them are well known and attrat more links than poorly linked pages.

In this work we fous on the random network of human relationships. It evolves

in very ompliated manner, therefore it is very hard to impose some well

aepted rules for its growth. Hene, we do not look for the time evolution

of human aquaintanes. Instead we inquire stati ase with random network

already developed.

If the aquaintane between A and B is present, we link them with the edge. In

this way we obtain random graph of human relationships. To this network we

an introdue metris by assigning (cid:28)xed position in the plane to every person.

In order to obtain analytial results, we assume onstant population density. In

partiular, we suppose that people(cid:21)verties are distributed regularly and form

square lattie in the plane. With proper resaling, edges of the unit square in

this lattie have length 1. Further we assume that probability that two people

know eah other depends on their distane by means of some distribution

funtion. Clearly this is a model but it should keep some basi features of the

real random network of human relationships.

2 Mathematial model

Let's have in(cid:28)nite square lattie with the length of unit square equal to 1
and one person in every vertex. Probability that two people with distane d
know eah other we label as Q(d). We assume homogeneity of the population,

2

therefore this probability funtion is the same for every pair.

Summation of Q(d) through all verties leads to average number of aquain-
tanes for any person whih we denote NA . Further we assume that funtion
Q(d) is hanging slowly on the sale of 1. Therefore we an hange summation

to integration and we have

Our aim is to quantify the average degree of separation h
i for ouples with the
same geometrial distane equal to b. To ahieve this we hoose two suh people
and name them A and B . With proper transformation (shift and rotation) of
oordinate system their positions are ~rA = [0, 0], ~rB = [b, 0].

3 Analytial solution

Every person in the lattie an be loated by its oordinates [x, y]. We will
denote distane between X and Y as dXY . For the relation of aquaintane let's

introdue symbol ∼. Obviously, this is a binary relation whih is symmetri
Y ) =
but it is not transitive. Probability that X knows Y is then P (X
Q(dXY )

Probability that the degree of separation for A and B with distane b is equal
to some D we assign as P (D). If we want to (cid:28)nd out the average degree of
i, we need to know probabilities P (D) for
separation in present network h
di(cid:27)erent values of D . At the moment only P (0) is known, sine apparently
P (0) = Q(dAB) = Q(b).

Let's examine degree of separation D = 2. This means that there are two
other persons on the path between A and B . Their oordinates we denote as
~r1 = (x1, y1) and ~r2 = (x2, y2). For the presene of suh a trak edges A1, 12
and 2B are needed together with edges A2, 1B and AB missing (see piture

growth of P (D) we an easily see for whih D∗

In order to write down an expression for h

(2). By this integration we obtain number of onneted triples A12 with node
A (cid:28)xed. We just have to avoid double ounting of every trak (interhanging
positions of 1 and 2) (cid:21) this brings additional fator 1/2. Average number of

Equations (4) and (5) are solutions of the problem. Unfortunately, relevant

funtions Q(d) (see setion Analytial entries) do not have analytial form

of their forward and inverse Fourier transformation. Therefore we have to

i and P (D) numerially. Equation (4) require very high
alulate values of h
preision of alulation. This makes evaluation of P (D) very slow and even

C

with some lever treatment (see Appendix A) in fat impossible for high values

of b. This is just our ase, beause we are interested in b = 50 000. Thus some

other (approximate) approah is needed. First we have to know nature of

funtion Q(d).

4 Empirial entries

In the present, there are approximately 6 400 millions people on the Earth.
It means that length of assumed square lattie side is 2L = 80 000. In or-
der to obtain numeri results we hoose b = 50 000 and average number of
aquaintanes NA = 1 000.

To get some insight on the distribution Q(d), some analysis is needed. First it
is lear that Q(d) should be dereasing with d. Moreover, losely living people

know eah other almost ertainly. That is

lim
d→0

Q(d) = 1.

(6)

Together with (1) we now have two requirements for Q(d). Indeed, there are
many funtions satisfying them. E. g. if we hoose Q(d) = C exp[
r/a] it
follows that C = 1 and a = 12.6.

−

The last quantity we an ompute is the average number of distant people

every node know, Nd . Here distant means that their distane from hosen

5

(cid:28)xed node is greater than L/2. This is a simple analogy to the number of

people we know on the other side of the Earth. So we have

Nd = NA −

2π

rQ(r) dr.

L/2

Z0

(7)

(8)

is in the lear ontradition to the fat that there are people who have very

For the last disussed exponential distribution holds Nd ≈
distant friends. It implies that Q(d) annot derease so fast, wide tails are
inevitable in our model. This leads us to power-law distributions 1/xa

. This result

. With

10−13

respet to the (6) we expet

Qa(d) =

1
1 + da .

Number of far friends now ranges from Nd ≈
10
(a = 2.5). In this artile we also show results for the normal distribution
d)
Qn(d) = exp[
(Nd = 0).

(a = 4.0) to Nd ≈
0) and the uniform distribution Qu(d) = ϑ(RA −

ad2] (Nd ≈
−

10−4

With regard to the fat that all used distributions Q(d) approah zero for
large values of d it is almost ertain that the shortest hain of aquaintanes
between hosen A and B do not run out of the examined lattie with side
80 000. Therefore it doesn't matter if we have integration (summation) bound
40 000. This allows us to use all results derived for in(cid:28)nite

L =

in in(cid:28)nity or ±

±

lattie in the real ase of (cid:28)nite lattie.

5 Approximate solution for power-law distributions

To demonstrate alulation we again take P (2) as an example. In previous

setion we found out that power-law distributions are espeially important in

our model. Their joint probability Q(r1)Q(b
r1 = 0 and minimum for r1 = b/2. Their ratio is

In this setion we summarize results for various distributions Q(d) ranging
from uniform Qu and normal Qn to power distributions Q4(cid:21)Q2.5 (f. (8) and

Substituting these values into (10) leads us to values of mean degree of sep-

Q(d) results in high values of lustering oe(cid:30)ients (from 0.30 to 0.06) to-
gether with small values of D∗
(from 6 to 4). Thus small world phenomenon

is learly present in these networks.

With these values of Ci oe(cid:30)ients expressions in parentheses in (10) do not
fall lose to zero for quite wide range of values of D . Therefore we an (very

normal distribution. Suh a saling is similar to the saling in the Erdös-Rényi

model, though values of lustering oe(cid:30)ient are kept high as we demanded

in the introdution.

Probability P (2) an be evaluated also by straightforward summation in a-

ordane with (2) although it takes huge amount of omputer time. Obtained

values agree very well with results presented above for all examined exponents

but 2.5 (cid:21) this ase requires more omputer time than it was given. Computa-
tion of P (3) in the same way exeeds our possibilities for every exponent and

we do not regard it neessary.

Time evolution and limitations

Human relationships in modern world are muh more widespread than it was

in the past. One an think of slowly hanging exponent of the distribution

funtion Q(d) from large values to smaller.

1

Aording to Fig. 5 we see that

this would a(cid:27)et exat value of lustering oe(cid:30)ient. However it would remain

high enough for wide range of exponents. Similarly hanges of mean degree of

separation are not important at all (cid:21) it remains very small omparing to the

size of human population.

Finally it has to be noted that in the desribed model we do not onsider

presene of some organized hierarhi strutures in human soiety. E. g. hief

of the (cid:28)rm knows his employees, but he also knows another hiefs who know

Perhaps resulting to almost (cid:29)at distribution in the future (internet helps to bridge

1

the distanes).

10

their employees, et. Amount of people involved in the hierarhial tree grows

exponentially with the number of its levels. Suh an arrangement therefore

introdues additional way how to know eah other with small resulting degree

of separation. In presented alulation we do not inlude this e(cid:27)et (partially

beause it is not lear how to do it). Yet there is one important insight. If we

proved degree of separation being small without onsidering of the hierarhies,

their presene would even derease it.

7 Conlusion

In this artile we examined mean degree of separation and lustering oe(cid:30)ient

for the random network of the human relationships. We presented the model

within whih we were able to ompute this quantities. For power-law deay of

probability Q(d) we obtained mean degree of separation small omparing to

the size of the network along with big value of the mean lustering oe(cid:30)ient.

Both features are typial for small world networks. Thus we showed that small

world phenomenon an be understood as simple onsequene of probabilities

additivity.

We saw that style of alulation depends on the used distribution Q(d). For

some speial ases omputation was (cid:28)nished analytially. In other ases thanks

to some approximations we utilized the advantage of (5) where b do not enter

inverse Fourier transformation that makes it easy to evaluate numerially.

It's worth to note that herein solved model is similar to the Watts and Strogatz

model [6℄ where long shortuts were introdued by random rewiring proedure.

On the other hand in our model long shortuts are present thanks to wide tails

of power-law distributions.

Presented model brings two basi advantages. First, derivation and the re-

sulting relations for C and D∗

are more simple. Moreover, our model is more

realisti one. Though, fundamental issue remained the same. Introdution of

long shortuts to the system dereases average degree of separation rapidly but

keeps lustering oe(cid:30)ient high enough for so alled small world phenomenon

to appear.

A Numeris of the Fourier transformation

The Fourier integrals enountered in the solution of presented problem an

not be solved analytially thus numerial tehniques have to be used. In the

inverse Fourier transform this is espeially awkward beause we meet rapidly

osillating term exp[i bu]. Here b is the distane between hosen persons A
and B , what is by assumption big number, b = 50 000. Therefore we have to
ompute Fourier transformation of f (d) very aurately. In order to make om-

putation less demanding on the omputer time, it is onvenient to (cid:28)nd some

approximation in the omputing of the inverse Fourier transformation. For the

sake of simpliity, we will ontinue with this derivation in the onedimensional

ase.

The Fourier transformation of the even funtion f (x) is an even real funtion.

Aording to the (4) we are looking for the inverse Fourier transformation of

its n-th power, we will denote it ˆg(u). It is also even real funtion. Therefore

its inverse Fourier transformation is real funtion (sine-proportional terms

vanish). Thus

g(b) =

ˆg(u)eibu du =

ˆg(u) cos[bu] du.

In the integrand of previous equation we an make Taylor expansion of ˆg(u)
around ξn = 2π(n + 1/2)/b. Thereafter terms of kind um cos[bu] emerge (m
∈
N). Suh integrals are easy to ompute (cid:21) (cid:28)rst two terms of resulting expansion

are then

This helps to speed up inverse Fourier transformation (cid:21) we do not have to

know so many values of ˆg(u). For every range In evaluation of ˆg(u) in three

(for the leading term of (A.1)) is enough. We just have to keep in mind that

these points have to be lose enough (with respet to 2π/b), otherwise we an

obtain evidently inorret results.

Abstract: Time evolutions of number of cities, population of cities,
world population, and size distribution of present languages are studied in
terms of a new model, where population of each city increases by a random
rate and decreases by a random division. World population and size distri-
bution of languages come out in good agreement with the available empirical
data.

Introduction: Many old languages, like ancient Greek and Roman may
have spread in terms of colonization, where the cities were shaped by the
current environmental conditions (see Viviane model, Refs.1, 2, and refer-
ences therein). Yet, the cited mechanism may not cover all the relevant
situations. Many medieval languages of the empires are not spoken on the
same lands presently. On the other hand, Chinese and Indian languages
might have spread in terms of increasing population, rather than coloniza-
tion and other means. In the present contribution a new model for many
languages is suggested, where city population increases by a random rate
and decreases by a random division.[3,4] The model is given in the following
section; applications and results are displayed in next one. The last section
is devoted for discussion and conclusion.

Model: We start with some number of cities (M (t)), which varies in
time (t). Each city (i) might have equal initial population (Pi(t = 0)) or
the initial population of each may be random and equal to P ri, where P is
some constant and ri is a random real number 0 ≤ ri < 1, with i ≤ M (0).
We assign a random population growth rate (Ri) to each society, Ri = Rri,
where R is constant. Through the evolution of history, each city at each
time step with probability H gives birth to a new one where the splitting
ratio of population equals S, which is assumed to be the same for all the
cities. If the current population of the city (i) is Pi(t), SPi(t) many citizens
move away to establish a new city and (1 − S)Pi(t) many remain. And, due
to the present splitting, the number of cities M (t) increases by one; if two
cities split at t, then M (t) increases by two, etc. Please note that, results
do not change if 1 − S is substituted for S, i.e., if the moved and remained
citizens are interchanged. So, the greatest value for S is 0.5, eﬀectively.

Whenever a new city is established, her people may survive the previous
language or create a new one. We assume that new conditions (geographical,

1

etc) and lack of interactions with the home city promotes a new language.
So, we take one language for each city.

Furthermore, cities may be considered as countries (states) equally well,
since almost each city was a state in past. And for t → ∞, these cities which
have big population may obviously be taken as a state (country). In any
case, the unit land (i), i.e., city (country, state), may be evaluated as the
totality of humans speaking the same language (i), and our assumption of
one language for one city is satisﬁed. So, i counts cities and languages.

Initiation: We assume M (0) many cities existed initially, and each may
be assumed to have more or less the same population, at least in order of
magnitude. Yet, to study the eﬀect of small cities, we consider random
initial populations too, and assign P ri many citizens to each, where P is
some constant and ri is a random real number 0 ≤ ri < 1, with i ≤ M (0).
The opulation growth rate (Ri) is also ﬁxed initially, and not varied in time.
(Further generation cities randomly get a new Ri during splitting, and do
not change this parameter later.)

Evolution: We let the cities grow in time, within a process known as

multiplicative noise,

Pi(t) = (1 + Ri)Pi(t − 1)

,

and if a random number is smaller than the splitting probability H the city
(i) splits.

The world population (W ) is,

(1)

(2)

W (t) =

Pi(t)

,

M (t)

X
i=1

and the model must predict the real data for W (t) [5,6].

Please note that, the introduced parameters have units involving time,
and our time unit is arbitrary here. And, after some period of evolution
in time we (reaching the present) stop the simulation and calculate the
probability distribution function (PDF) for the number of cities and size.

Applications and Results: The basic parameters are: M (0) (initial
number of cities), Pi(t = 0) (=P ri, initial population of each city, and
uniqueness (ri = 1, for all i) or randomness of it (0 ≤ ri < 1, for all i)),
Ri (= Rri, population growth rate), and H (historical factor for splitting
of cities, assumed to be the same for all the cities). The splitting ratio S
is also considered as universal. Some of the pronounced parameters would
be eliminated if we knew the real historical data. Please note that, M (0)

2

and P (0) deﬁne the origin of our time scale, and an increase in M (0) and in
P (0) means shifting the time origin forward, and vice versa. On the other
hand, R and H are deﬁned per unit of time. So scaling of only one of them
means scaling the time axis by the same factor, but inversely, where results
remain invariant.

We deﬁne our time unit to be one decade (10 years), we take t = 0 at

10,000 B.C. and run simulations for 12,000 years, i.e., for 1,200 points.

Pre-historic world: We don’t know world population (W (0)) and num-
ber of cities (M (0)) at 10,000 B.C., and Ri is also unknown. We run our
simulations for various M (0), Pi(0), and Ri, and tried to predict the real
data for W (t) (Figure 1, where earlier portion is obtained by estimation [5]).
In Fig. 1 the super-exponential behavior in W is crucial. We consider also
the prediction (made by United Nations) about world population to be 6.5
billion in 2005, and to be about 10 billion in 2050 [6]. We display one of
our results for W (t) in Figure 2, where super-exponential character may be
observed, as explained within the caption.

In ﬁgures 2,3 we take W (0) = 500, 000 by guess. Accordingly, we take
M (0) = 1000 with P = 10, 000 and we deﬁne Pi(0) randomly. Furthermore,
for splitting S may be taken about 10 % . Yet, when a country splits, S
may vary from about 50 % to 10 %. Please note that, H may be considered
as the rate of increasing the number of cities; variation of H changes M (t)
for a given W (t).

Within the present approach, we get an exponential growth in M (t),
and super-exponential growth in W (t). H and P are eﬀective on the rate of
M (t) and W (t), respectively. So, for a given initial world, one may have a
variety in M (t) for a given W (t), and vice versa.

In Figure 4 is displayed the PDF for the current number of cities or
languages where we assumed initially one million people, now all speaking
the same language. For comparison, Figure 5 is the empirical PDF for the
current number of cities or languages [7].

Within our results, (the population of the biggest city or) the number
of people speaking the most wide-spread language and the current world
population came out as 1.025 × 109, and 13.3 × 109 respectively, so the ratio
is 7.7 %.

In all the ﬁgures we utilized S = 0.5, which means that the cities are
divided by a half. In order to see the eﬀect of small S, i.e. fragmentation of
cities, we try S = 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, and 0.0001 (not shown).

Discussion and Conclusion: Many parameters of the present formal-
ism are not crucial for the size distribution of languages in Fig. 4; and, one
of the parameters could be dropped, i.e. absorbed with the unit for time.

3

In our runs, several sets of parameters (with minor changes) gave similar
results to Figure 4, and we selected one of them for display here. What is
most important for the size distribution of languages is the ﬁnal population
of each city. The present model and the method may be considered as a
reasonable one, since the reality may be predicted. Furthermore, we do not
have any contradiction with Viviane model and Schulze model [8].

Figure 4: PDF for the number of languages at present. Here, we have
initially one million people speaking the same language. At present (in
1300 tours) the size of the biggest language is 1.025 × 109 and the world
population is 13.3 × 109; so, the ratio is 0.07 (12.9:1). Other parameters are:
H = 0.0021, S = 0.5, R = 0.02. The dashed curve demonstrates that, our
distribution is a slightly asymmetric Gaussian. (See also the relevant text.)

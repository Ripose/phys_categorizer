This paper presents a statistical analysis of the structure of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) social networks
that captures social associations of distributed peers in resource sharing. Peer social networks
appear to be mainly composed of pure resource providers that guarantee high resource availability
and reliability of P2P systems. The major peers that both provide and request resources are only
a small fraction. The connectivity between peers, including undirected, directed (out and in) and
weighted connections, is scale-free and the social networks of all peers and major peers are small
world networks. The analysis also conﬁrms that peer social networks show in general disassortative
correlations, except that active providers are connected between each other and by active requesters.
The study presented in this paper gives a better understanding of peer relationships in resource
sharing, which may help a better design of future P2P networks and open the path to the study of
transport processes on top of real P2P topologies.

INTRODUCTION

In the last several years, many systems have been an-
alyzed unraveling the way in which their constituents in-
teract which each other. Surprisingly, many seemingly
diverse phenomena found in biological, social and tech-
nological systems [1, 2, 3, 4] share a complex interaction
topology that is in most cases characterized by the ex-
istence of a few key nodes that participates in a large
number of interactions [1, 2, 3, 4]. This observation is in
sharp contrast to previous studies that in order to model
the dynamical aspects of biological, social and techno-
logical processes assumed a regular or a random distri-
bution of interactions for the system’s units. Obviously,
the new approach to the topology of networked systems
has important bearings on their dynamics and function-
ing as have been pointed out during the last few years
[1, 2, 3, 4]. A ﬁrst step is then the characterization of the
topological properties in order to get better insights into
the dynamics, functioning and new designs of natural and
man-made networked systems.

Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks form a kind of open, de-
centralized overlay network on top of the Internet [2],
on which distributed users communicate directly to ﬁnd
and share resources, often music and movie ﬁles. These
networks may be one of the few largest distributed com-
puting systems ever, and more surprisingly, they can run
with great stability and resilient performance in face of
possibly the most ferocious dynamics. The number of
hosts running on Gnutella was reported to be 1,800,000 in
August 2005 [5]. Recent studies have extensively investi-
gated the traﬃc, shared ﬁles, queries and peer properties
of some widely applied P2P systems such as Gnutella and
Kazaa [6, 7, 8, 9]. It has also been reported that node

connectivity (the number of partners a node interacts
with) in Gnutella follows a combination of a power-law
distribution (usually for nodes with more than 10 connec-
tions) and a quasi-constant distribution (for nodes with
fewer connections) [7]. This may be due to the arbitrarily
created connections: peers establish connections to oth-
ers by searching presently available peers on the overlay,
in addition to a few links to well known hosts provided
by the system. Peer connections in these systems only
suggest routes of traﬃc and usually have no relation to
peer properties, e.g., peer interests or resources held by
peers.

Recent literature proposed P2P social networks, to
capture social associations of peers in resource sharing
[10]. Similar to human social networks, a P2P social
network is a collection of connected computing nodes
(peers), each of which is acquainted with some subset
of the others. The social connections of peers indicate
that a peer is a resource provider or can provide infor-
mation of resource providers to another peer. Connec-
tion strengths imply the acquaintenanceship or utility
of a peer to another, i.e., how useful one peer is to an-
other in resource sharing. Although P2P systems be-
come more and more signiﬁcant in distributed applica-
tions, there is little knowledge about how peers are so-
cially connected to function together. Primitive investi-
gation in [10] conﬁrmed that when peers were organized
according to their social relationships, (instead of arbi-
trarily connected links such as those created in Gnutella),
the formed P2P networks had obviously improved search
speed and success rate. Moreover, the structure of P2P
social networks is shown to be directed, asymmetric and
weighted.

This paper will provide a more comprehensive analysis

of peer social networks. In particular, we report on prop-
erties such as degree distribution, clustering coeﬃcient,
average path length, betweenness and degree-degree cor-
relations. This analysis, on one hand, will give a better
understanding of peer associations in resource sharing
and provide hints for future P2P network design. On
the other hand, simulations of transport and other pro-
cesses relevant to this kind of network will be enabled
from the detailed analysis of the structure of the net-
works addressed here.

II. PEER-TO-PEER SOCIAL NETWORKS

Several P2P social networks were constructed based on
real user information collected from the Gnutella system.
An experimental machine running revised Gnucleus, a
kind of Gnutella client, joined the Gnutella network as a
super-node, so that it could be connected by more nor-
mal peers and many other super-nodes each of which was
also connected by hundreds of normal peers. In order not
to disturb the actual social links between peers, the ex-
perimental node did not provide any shared contents nor

to record the traﬃc passing through it.
In particular,
it recorded information such as which peer answered a
query of which other peer, indicating that the former
may be a useful contact to the latter. The experimen-
tal Gnucleus node ran on the Gnutella network from 5
hours to 3 days. It usually connected 300 normal peers
and 30 other super nodes. The traﬃc data it recorded
involved 1,000 to 200,000 peers. These data, obviously,
only reﬂected associations of a small group of peers in
the Gnutella system within a limited period of time. The

Gnutella system should be continuously sampled at mul-
tiple points in order to obtain a more accurate and global
picture of peer associations.

The possible social links between peers were discov-
ered from the collected raw data to form corresponding
P2P social networks. A directed connection was created
from peer A to peer B if B was a query answerer of A.
The strength or weight of this connection indicated how
many queries B answered A. The stronger a connection
strength is, the more important the end peer is to the
other peer of the connection. A connection strength with
value 1 suggests a single communication, and hence a
weak association. Strength with a constantly high value
suggests the end peer is a frequent resource provider of
the start peer, and hence a long-term and possibly per-
manent social relation. The connection strength, how-
ever, may decay over time in the absence of any contribu-
tion from the end peer. This issue was further discussed
in [10].

As P2P social networks are directed and the connec-
tion strengths indicate peer aﬃnity, this paper will study
P2P social networks in respect of their undirected, di-
rected (including out and in) and weighted connections.
Of particular interest are the results obtained when the
edges are considered weighted. As most networks in real
systems are weighted, it is expected that their full de-
scription will provide a better and more accurate scenario
for their study and modeling. However, the investigation
on weighted networks is still a new area in network mod-
eling, including communication networks, and has only
been addressed recently [11].

of three out of six P2P social networks studied (marked

both at a magnitude of 105 ∼ 106. The other three are
not shown for space reason, but exhibit the same statis-
tics as of those discussed henceforth. Among tens or hun-
dreds of thousands of peers, only a few of them acted as
both requesters and providers. These peers play a major
role in P2P social networks as they contribute essential
links to the networks. These peers are hence called major
peers. Table I also shows the information of the social
networks of major peers (marked as SN1 major ∼ SN6
major), reﬁned from the above original social networks,
respectively. The number of major nodes and their edges
is only of 102 ∼ 103. For instance, the number of nodes in
the major network obtained from SN1 drops from 42,186
to only 221. In the remaining of this paper, both origi-
nal P2P social networks and major peers’ social networks
will be investigated.

III. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

A. Connectivity properties

Table I gives a summarization of the average degree
hki, range of out degrees kout and in degrees kin for
the unweighted representations of P2P networks ana-
lyzed. In the case of weighted representations, the table
shows the average weighted degree or strength hkwi =
Pj wij + Pj wji and range of weighted out kw−out (the
ﬁrst term in the sum) and in kw−in degrees (the second
term in the sum) of the original and major P2P social
networks studied. Here, wij is the weight of the ij link
and means that j answered wij queries from i. The av-
erage connection weight hwi, the weight range w and the
number of symmetric links are also listed in this table.

Each peer in the original peer social networks has an
average of 4.3±0.22 neighbors. This also means that on
average a peer has 2.15 out degrees and in degrees. This
number slightly increases with the number of peers, but
is very small compared with a fully connected network of
the same size hki = N −1 ∼ 105∼6. Some peers, however,
have up to nearly three thousands to tens of thousands
out connections (i.e., resource providers), while the max-
imum connected resource requesters (i.e., in degree) of a
peer is only hundreds up to one thousand. This suggests
that there are generally more available providers, though
a provider only serves a small fraction of peers in the
network. The average weighted degree is around 9∼12
per node and the average connection weight is around
2.3. That is, the frequency of a peer to contact another
is about 2.3 times, though in reality a peer can answer
another peer’s requests as many as ten thousands times.
Similar results have been shown in major peers’ social
networks. The social networks of major peers are denser
than the original ones, as the average connectivity is al-
most doubled among major peers. The average connec-
tion strength of major social networks is nearly the same
as that of the original social networks, suggesting that the
average level of peer acquaintance is independent from

SN1, SN5 and SN6 are diﬀerent networks, they all fall in

network sizes. While there are hundreds of connections
present in the network, only few of them have symmet-
ric links, less than 0.03% of the whole connections and
all the symmetric connections are between major peers.
This proves that real peer social networks are extremely
asymmetric: while one peer presents a useful social con-
tact to another, it is seldom the case in which the other
deems that one as its useful supplier.

Table II lists the percentage of peers that have no or 1,
2 and more out and in connections in both original and
major social networks. Signiﬁcantly, 98.5% of peers have
no out neighbors at all. These peers are pure providers
that never requested anything. Accordingly there are

than requesters.

only 0.86% peers that did not answer any request of oth-
ers. 68.5% of the peers answered one query and more
than 30% peers answered more. A similar phenomenon
has also been found in major peers networks. The above
result, namely, the fact that there are much more re-
source providers than requesters, points to an important
structural property that may be at the root of the high
reliability of Gnutella despite the system’s extreme dy-
namics and uncertainty.

The degree distributions of undirected, out and in con-
nections have also been investigated. Fig. 1 illustrates
unweighted and weighted degree distributions of the orig-
inal social networks SN1, SN5 and SN6 respectively. (So-
cial networks of major peers present very similar degree
distributions so they are not shown here due to the lack of
space.) The results conﬁrm that peer social networks fol-
low power-law distributions and the exponents are sum-
marized in Table III.

It is worth noting that a universal exponent has been
obtained for each group of networks (see Fig. 1), namely
P2P social networks show the same exponent of the de-
gree distribution for undirected connections no matter of
their speciﬁc characteristics (e.g., size, number of edges,
etc) and the same holds for directed and weighted distri-
butions. Moreover, weighted networks exhibit similar de-
gree distributions, though statistically diﬀerent as far as
the exponent of the power law distribution is concerned,
to those of unweighted networks. For six peer social net-
works and corresponding major networks, their out de-
gree distributions have an average exponent of γ ≈ 1 < 2,
and both in and undirected degree distributions have an
exponent γ > 2. This is an interesting feature as γ = 2
forms a dividing line between networks with two diﬀerent
dominating behaviors. Hence the diﬀerent power-law dis-
tributions obtained here suggest that the average proper-
ties of peer social networks are dominated by (requesting)
individuals that have a large number of providers, while
providing peers with fewer connected requesters domi-
nate the provision ﬂow of resources.

Recent studies reported that the underlying peer-to-
peer Gnutella network has degree exponent less than 2
[12][13], contrary to the undirected degree exponent of
P2P social networks found in our work. While global
information exchange mechanisms are closely related to
networks with exponent γ < 2 [12], P2P social net-
works may involve more local interactions between as-
sociated peers. However, peer social networks won’t pre-

vent global interaction and information diﬀusion (e.g.,
web caches) if required.
It would be interesting to see
the performance and topological changes when P2P so-
cial networks are incorporated with those global mecha-
nisms.

B. Average shortest path lengths and betweenness

The shortest distances between all pair of peers that
have (directed) paths from one to another are calculated.
The average distances of the shortest paths in the orig-
inal and major social networks are around 6.6 and 4.6
respectively, as shown in Table I. Here the law of six
degrees of separation still come into existence in spite of
the huge sizes and sparseness of the peer social networks.
The social networks of major peers are obviously better
connected. In general, a major peer can reach another
randomly chosen major peer in around 4.6 steps. The
smaller average shortest path length of major peers is of
the order one may expect from the logarithmic depen-
dency of hli with N in small-world networks. Another
possible explanation is that major peers show disassorta-
tive correlations. This kind of correlations happens when
nodes of diﬀerent degrees are likely connected. That is,
there is no core that concentrates all major peers. Other-
wise, one would expect a greater decrease in the average
shortest path lengths than that observed. This hypothe-
sis will be conﬁrmed in the following analysis on degree-
degree correlations, which shows that, within statistical
ﬂuctuations, peer social networks are mainly disassorta-
tive.

The average path lengths of both original peer so-
cial networks and major peer social networks are much
smaller than those for a regular two-dimensional lattice
of the same size, which range from tens to hundreds. It
has been found that the average distances vary logarith-
mically with the number of individuals in some kinds
of social networks including scientiﬁc collaboration net-
works [14, 15]. Unfortunately, our data are too sparse to
conﬁrm or reject this. (However, as shown in the tables,
hli is certainly small in all cases.) Analysis of more peer
social networks may be helpful.

The maximum distance lmax between connected peers,
or diameter of the network, is on average 14.5 for original
social networks and 12.5 for major peer networks. This
suggests that connected peers in these networks can be

reached by a chain of at most 15 or 13 acquaintances. Fig.
2 illustrates the frequency of the shortest paths in social
networks SN1, SN5 and SN6 respectively. These shortest
paths have a long tail, which distinguishes peer social
networks from random networks with the same number
of nodes and edges. The long tail of the shortest path
has been reported as a property of small world networks
[16].

A property closely related to the distribution of aver-
age shortest path lengths is the betweenness. The be-
tweenness measures the centrality of a node in a network
and allows exploration of the inﬂuence a node has over
the spread of information through the network. It is nor-
mally calculated as the fraction of shortest paths between
node pairs that pass through the node of interest. Be-
tweenness is commonly applied in social network anal-
ysis, and has been recently introduced for load analysis
in scale-free networks [18]. A direct calculation of peer
betweenness in the original peer networks is rather labori-
ous due to the enormous number of peers involved. Here
only the average betweenness hbi/N of the major peers
social networks is presented in this section, as listed in
Table I. The average betweenness over major peers is
between 0.3N ∼ N , indicating that the social networks
are not dominated by a few highly connected peers.

We further investigated betweenness distribution p(b),
the probability that any given peer is passed over by b
shortest paths (see Fig. 3) and the relationship between
the average betweenness of a peer and its connectivity
k (see Fig. 4). Again, no clear power-law decay for the
former or a linear increase for the latter has been found,

as previously reported for other networks [17, 18]. In our
case, the fact that bk does not scale with k, and hence,
the lack of any correlations important for information
traﬃc and delivery, is another indication of the unique
topological properties of these networks, making their

ing at this point that an interesting and relevant issue to
be explored more carefully in future works is whether or
not self-averaging veriﬁes in these systems. While Figs.
2 and 3 may suggest the lack of self-averaging, they cor-
respond to major networks, which are still too small to
draw deﬁnitive conclusions. Moreover, the intrinsic dy-
namic nature of these networks may perfectly reconcile
networks properties that are not sample-dependent (e.g
global properties such as degree distributions) with other
local metrics that depend on the sampling (as those de-
picted in Figs. 2 and 3).

C. Clustering coeﬃcient

The clustering coeﬃcient is an important local net-
work property that measures how well the neighbors of
any node in a network are locally connected. Table I
gives the values of clustering coeﬃcients of the networks
studied here. Original peer social networks possess a sim-
ilar clustering coeﬃcient hci ≈ 0.02. This small number
suggests that peer neighbors are not closely connected,
i.e., only a few neighbors deem others as their acquain-
tances. However, the closeness of peer social networks
is better than ER random graphs with the same size

and average connectivity, whose clustering coeﬃcients
are hcirand = hki/N ≈ 10−5, three orders of magnitude
less than those of the peer social networks. At the same
time, the estimate for the clustering coeﬃcient might
be consistent with that of random graphs with scale-
free degree distribution. Compared with the original so-
cial networks, major peers show closer relationships with
each other. The clustering coeﬃcients of major peers
are nearly 0.1, one to two magnitudes larger than their
corresponding random graphs. Thus the active players
in peer social networks, which both provide and request
resources, are themselves relatively well connected.

The clustering coeﬃcients are kept constant for peer
social networks or major peers social networks with dif-
ferent sizes, suggesting there may be a unique value to
them, a property that has been observed in other sys-
tems as well [1, 3]. Moreover, the highly clustered prop-
erty and short paths between distributed peers (as intro-
duced in Section III.B) conﬁrm that peer social networks
are small worlds, as other natural or artiﬁcial networks,
such as ecosystems, human societies and the Internet
[1, 2, 3, 4].

Studies on scientiﬁc collaboration networks and Inter-
net topologies reported a power-law relationship between
the average clustering coeﬃcient Ck over nodes of degree
k, that is, Ck ∼ k−a [14, 17]. Fig. 5 plots Ck of some
original peer social networks in relation to peers’ undi-
rected, out and in degrees. A clear power-law form is
diﬃcult to claim in our data. Nevertheless, the non-ﬂat
clustering coeﬃcient distributions shown in the ﬁgures
suggest that the dependency of C on k is nontrivial, and
thus points to some degree of hierarchy in the networks.
Further study of social networks’ hierarchy will clarify
this point and will be undertaken in future work.

other nodes with many connections and vice versa. Tech-
nological and biological networks are in general disassor-
tative, and social networks are often assortatively mixed,
as suggested by the study on scientiﬁc collaboration so-
cial networks [14]. Contrasting to this however, Internet
dating communities, a kind of social network embedded
in a technological one, displayed a signiﬁcant disassorta-
tive mixing [19]. This seems to be our case as well.

Table IV lists the correlation coeﬃcients of all types
of degree-degree correlations for both original peer social
networks and networks of major peers. Correlations are
measured by calculating the Pearson’s correlation coeﬃ-
cient r for the degrees at either side of an edge:

Networks with assortative mixing are those in which
nodes with many connections tend to be connected to

Similar to Internet dating communities, peer social
networks present dissortative mixing when directions are
not considered in peer connections. Positive mixing is
shown for rinout and rinin in most social networks, sug-
gesting that active requesters (with a high kout) tend to
associate active providers (with a high kin), and even
active providers tend to associate with each other. Be-
tween major peers that both provide and request re-
sources, active requesters also have a preference towards
each other. It is not surprising that routin is always neg-
ative in both original and major peer networks, which
means that providers with many requesters are actually
less often associated with frequent requesters. The gener-
ally dissortative mixing property of peer social networks
suggests that peer networks in general are vulnerable to
targeted attacks on highest degree peers but a few attacks
on some providers may not destroy the network connec-
tivity due to the existence of other providers in the core
group.

IV. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK

This paper presents the ﬁrst study on social associa-
tions of distributed peers in Peer-to-Peer networks. Sev-
eral peer social networks have been constructed from the
real user data collected from the Gnutella system. Basic
properties of the social networks, including degree dis-
tributions, local topological quantities and degree-degree
correlations have been particularly studied in this pa-
per. The results have proved that peer social networks
are small world networks, as peers are clustered and the
path length between them is small. Moreover, most of
the peers (nearly 98.5%) are pure resource providers, con-
tributing to the high resource reliability and availability
of P2P networks in resource sharing. Comparatively, free
riding peers that do not contribute any resources are only
a small fraction (less than 1%) of the whole network. For
peers that have more than one connection, their undi-
rected, directed (including out and in) and weighted de-

gree distributions follow a clear power-law distribution.
The exponents are greater than 2 for undirected and in
degrees and nearly 1 for out degrees. Investigations on
betweenness and correlations suggest that dynamics of
peer social networks are not dominated by a few highly
connected peers. In fact, the peer degrees are generally
disassortative mixing, except some rinin and rinout, sug-
gesting that active providers are connected between each
other and by active requesters.

The collected social networks studied in this paper are
only some small snapshots of the large-scale and contin-
uously changing P2P networks. However, the kind of
study performed here allows us to touch upon the real
network topologies that are diﬃcult to obtain with exist-
ing network models. The analysis results will give use-
ful hints for the future design of eﬀective P2P systems,
by considering their acyclic topologies and small world
architecture. In the future, the joint relation of the so-
cial network topology and the topology of the underlying
peer-to-peer network (e.g., Gnutella) will be studied to
examine their commonness and discrepancy. On top of
the kind of network found in the study, simulations of
processes can be enabled to investigate spreading pro-
cesses [2, 20], modeling of traﬃc ﬂow [21] and optimiza-
tion of network resources [22]. Based on the current study
on peer betweenness and degree correlations, we will fur-
ther investigate network hierarchy, peer work load and
dynamic properties of P2P social networks.

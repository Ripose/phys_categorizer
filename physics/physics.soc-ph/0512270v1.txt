Abstract. In this paper, we propose a self-learning mutual selection model to characterize weighted evolving
networks. By introducing the self-learning probability p and the general mutual selection mechanism,
which is controlled by the parameter m, the model can reproduce scale-free distributions of degree, weight
and strength, as found in many real systems. The simulation results are consistent with the theoretical
predictions approximately. Interestingly, we obtain the nontrivial clustering coeﬃcient C and tunable
degree assortativity r, depending on the parameters m and p. The model can unify the characterization of
both assortative and disassortative weighted networks. Also, we ﬁnd that self-learning may contribute to
the assortative mixing of social networks.

1 Introduction

In recent years, many empirical ﬁndings have triggered
the devotion of research communities to understand and
characterize the evolution mechanisms of complex net-
works including the Internet, the World-Wide Web, the
scientiﬁc collaboration networks and so on[1,2,3,4,5,6].
Many empirical evidences indicate that the networks in
various ﬁelds have some common characteristics. They
have a small average distance like random graphs, a large
clustering coeﬃcient and power-law degree distribution [1,
2], which is called the small-world and scale-free char-
acteristics. Recent works on the complex networks have
been driven by the empirical properties of real-world net-
works and the studies on network dynamics [7,8,9,10].
The ﬁrst successful attempt to generate networks with
large clustering coeﬃcient and small average distance is
that of Watts and Strogatz (WS model) [1]. Another sig-
niﬁcant model proposed by Barab´asi and Albert is called
scale-free network (BA network) [2]. The BA model sug-
gests that growth and preferential attachment are two
main self-organization mechanisms of the scale-free net-
works structure. However, the real systems are far from
boolean structure. The purely topological characterization
will miss important attributes often encountered in real
systems. Most recently, the access to more complete em-
pirical data allows scientists to study the weight evolution
of many real systems. This calls for the use of weighted

P

network representation. The weighted network is often de-
noted by a weighted adjacency matrix with element wij
representing the weight on the edge connecting node i
and j. As a note, this paper will only consider undirected
graphs where weights are symmetric, i.e. wij = wji. The
j∈Γ (i) wij ,
strength si of node i is usually deﬁned as si =
where the sum runs over the neighbor node set Γ (i). But
in some cases, the sum can not reﬂect the node strength
completely. Take the scientiﬁc collaboration networks for
example, the strength of a scientist include the publica-
tions collaborated with others and the publications writ-
ten only by himself or herself. Inspired by this idea, the
node strength is deﬁned as si =
j∈Γ (i) wij + ηi, where
ηi is node i’s self-attractiveness. As conﬁrmed by the em-
pirical data, complex networks exhibit power-law distri-
butions of degree P (k) ∼ k−γ with 2 ≤ γ ≤ 3 [11,12] and
weight P (w) ∼ w−θ [13], as well as strength P (s) ∼ s−α
[12]. The strength usually reveals scale-free property with
the degree s ∼ kβ, where β > 1 [12,14,15]. Driven by new
empirical ﬁndings, Barrat et al. have presented a simple
model (BBV for short) to study the dynamical evolution
of weighted networks [16]. But its disassortative property
can not answer the open question: why social networks are
diﬀerent from other disassortative ones? Previous mod-
els can generate either assortative networks [17,18,19] or
disassortative ones [12,17,18,20,21]. Our work may shed
some new light to answer the question: is there a generic
explanation for the diﬀerence of assortative and disassor-
tative networks.

Previous network models often adopt the mechanism
that only newly added nodes could select the pre-existing
nodes according to the preferential mechanism. However,
the evolution picture ignores the fact that old nodes will
choose the young nodes at the same time. Inspired by
this idea, Wang et al. have presented the mutual selection
mechanism, which leads to the creation and reinforcement
of connections [20]. But the model ignored the fact that
every node would enhance its strength not only by creat-
ing new links to others, but also could by self-learning. In
this paper, self-learning means that a node enhances its
strength only by itself without creating new links to oth-
ers. Inspired by this idea, we propose a weighted network
model that considers the topological evolution under the
general mechanisms of mutual selection and self-learning.
It can mimic the evolution of many real-world networks.
Our microscopic mechanisms can well explain the char-
acteristics of scale-free weighted networks, such as the
distributions of degree, weight and strength, as well as
the nonlinear strength-degree correlation, nontrivial clus-
tering coeﬃcient, assortativity coeﬃcient and hierarchical
structure that have been empirically observed [11,12,22,
23,24,25]. Also, the model appears as a more general one
that uniﬁes the characterization of both assortative and
disassortative weighted networks.

2 Construction of the model

Our model is deﬁned as following. The model starts from
N0 = m isolated nodes, each with an initial attractiveness
s0. In this paper, s0 is set to be 1.

(i) At each time step, a new node with strength s0 and

degree zero is added in the network;

(ii) Every node strength of the network would increase by
1 with the probability p; According to the probability
(1 − p), each existing node i selects m other existing
nodes for potential interaction according to the proba-
bility Equ. (1). Here, the parameter m is the number of
candidate nodes for creating or strengthening connec-
tions, p is the probability that a node would enhance
ηi by 1.

P

j∈Γ (i) wij + ηi. If a pair of unlinked nodes
where si =
is mutually selected, then an new connection will be built
between them. If two connected nodes select each other,
then their existing connection will be strengthened, i.e.,
their edge weight will be increased by 1. We will see that
m and p control the evolution of our network.

The evolution of real-world network can be easily ex-
plained by our model mechanisms. Take the scientiﬁc col-
laboration networks as an example: the collaboration of
scientists requires their mutual status and acknowledge-
ments. A scientists would like to collaborate with others,
whom have strong scientiﬁc potentials and long collabo-
rating history. On the contrary, he may write paper or
publications only by himself. When he publishes paper

as the sole author, his strength also increases, which can
be reﬂected by η. For technological networks with traf-
ﬁc taking place on them, both the limit of resources and
the internal demand of traﬃc increment for keeping the
normal function of the networks may cause the mutual
selections.

the theoretical predictions. Fig. 1(a)-(d) present the prob-
ability distributions of strength, degree and weight, as well
as the strength-degree correlation, ﬁxed p = 0.004 and
tuned by m. Fig. 1(a) gives the node strength distribution
P (s) ∼ sα, which is in good agreement with the theoret-
ical expression Equ. (6). Fig. 1(b) gives the node degree
distribution P (k) ∼ k−γ. Fig. 1(c) reports the probability
weight distribution, which also shows the power-law be-
havior P (w) ∼ wθ. Fig. 1(d) reports the average strength
of nodes with degree ki, which displays a nontrivial power-
law behavior s ∼ kβ as conﬁrmed by empirical measure-
ments [12]. Fig. 2(a)-(b) show the Zipf plot of the simu-
lation results by ﬁxing a moderate value p = 0.004 and
varying m. Fig. 2(a) conﬁrms with the math collabora-
tion network and the Zipf plot of Fig. 1(a) in Ref. [24].
Fig. 3(a)-(b) give the clustering coeﬃcient C(k) depend-
ing on connectivity k and the average connectivity knn of
the nearest neighbors of a node for various m. From the
numerical results, we can obtain the conclusion that the
larger the probability p, the larger the eﬀect of exponen-
tial correction at the head. However, the power-law tail
which again recovers the theoretical exponent expressions
can still be observed. Fig. 4 gives the numerical results for
various p when m = 5.

Depending on the parameters p and m, the unweighted
clustering coeﬃcient C, which describes the statistic den-
sity of connected triples, and degree assortativity r [26,
27] are demonstrated in Fig. 5. The assortative coeﬃcient
r can be calculated from

where ji, ki are the degrees of the vertices at the ends of
the ith edge, with i = 1, 2, · · · , M . From Fig. 5(a), we can
ﬁnd that C for ﬁxed m increases with p slightly, and C
for ﬁxed p monotonously increases with m. The cluster-
ing coeﬃcient of our model is tunable in a broad range
by varying both m and p, which makes it more power-
ful in modelling real-world networks. As presented in Fig.
5(b), degree assortativity r for ﬁxed p decreased with m,
unlike the clustering case. While r for ﬁxed m increases
with p slightly. The model can generates disassortative
networks for small m and large p, which can best mimic
technological networks. At large p and small m, assorta-
tive networks emerge and can be used to mimic social net-
works, such as the scientiﬁc collaboration networks. In the
model, enhancing the probability p can be considered as
the probability that a node would like to study by itself to
enhance its attractiveness or prestige. In the competitive
social networks, all nodes face many competitors. In order
to subsist or gain honorableness, they must enhance their
attractiveness or ability by studying themselves or collab-
orating with others. This explains the origin of assortative
mixing in our model and may shed light on the open ques-
tion: why social networks are diﬀerent from other disas-
sortative ones? For example, in the scientiﬁc collaboration
networks, the attractiveness of a scientist could not be
represented simple by the publications collaborated with
others. Indeed, there are many other important qualities

that will contribute to the attractiveness of a scientist,
for instance, the publications written by himself, etc. Per-
haps the diﬀerent self-learning probability contributes to
human beings fundamental diﬀerences. On the other hand,
m indicates the interaction frequency among the network
internal components. If m increases, the hubs would link
more and more “young” sites. Thus, the reason why the
disassortativity of the model is more sensitive to m lies in
that collaboration is more important than self-learning in
the technological networks. In addition, the components of
technological networks are usually physical devices, which
can not study by itself. Combining these two parameters
together, two competitive ingredients, which may be re-
sponsible for the mixing diﬀerence in real complex net-
works, are integrated in our model.

4 Conclusion and Discussion

In summary, integrating the mutual selection mechanism
between nodes and the self-learning mechanism, our net-
work model provides a wide variety of scale-free behav-
iors, tunable clustering coeﬃcient, and nontrivial degree-
degree and strength-degree correlations, just depending
on the probability of self-learning p and the parameter m
which governs the total weight growth. All the statistic
properties of our model are found to be supported by var-
ious empirical data. Interestingly and specially, studying
the degree-dependent average clustering coeﬃcient C(k)
and the degree-dependent average nearestneighbors de-
gree knn(k) also provides us with a better description of
the hierarchies and organizational architecture of weighted
networks. Our model may be beneﬁcial for future under-
standing or characterizing real networks.

Due to the apparent simplicity of our model and the
variety of tunable results, we believe our present model, for
all practical purposes, might be applied in future weighted
network research.

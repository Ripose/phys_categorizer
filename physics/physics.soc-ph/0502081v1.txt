Abstract. –

We analyze a database comprising quarterly sales of 55624 pharmaceutical products com-
mercialized by 3939 pharmaceutical ﬁrms in the period 1992–2001. We study the probability
density function (PDF) of growth in ﬁrms and product sales and ﬁnd that the width of the
PDF of growth decays with the sales as a power law with exponent β = 0.20 ± 0.01. We also
ﬁnd that the average sales of products scales with the ﬁrm sales as a power law with exponent
α = 0.57 ± 0.02. And that the average number products of a ﬁrm scales with the ﬁrm sales as
a power law with exponent γ = 0.42 ± 0.02. We compare these ﬁndings with the predictions of
models proposed till date on growth of business ﬁrms.

In economics there are unsolved problems that involve interactions among a large number
of subunits [1–3]. One of these problems is the structure of a business ﬁrm and its growth [2,4].
As in many physical models, decomposition of a ﬁrm into its constituent parts is an appropriate
starting place for constructing a model. Indeed, the total sales of a ﬁrm is comprised of a
large number of product sales. Previously accurate data on the “microscopic” product sales
have been unavailable, and hence it has been impossible to test the predictions of various
models. Here we analyze a new database, the Pharmaceutical Industry Database (PHID)
which records quarterly sales ﬁgures of 55624 pharmaceutical products commercialized by
3939 ﬁrms in the European Union and North America from September 1991 to June 2001.
We shall see that these data support the predictions of a simple model, and at the same time
the data do not support the microscopic assumptions of that model. In this sense, the model
has the same status as many statistical physics models, in that the predictions can be in accord
with data even though the details of microscopic interactions are not. The assumptions of this
simple model given in Ref [5] are as follows: (i) Firms tends to organize itself into multiple
divisions once they attain a particular size. (ii) The minimum size of ﬁrms in a particular
economy comes from a broad distribution. (iii) Growth rates of divisions are independent of
each other and there is no temporal correlation in their growth. With these assumptions the
model builds a diversiﬁed multi-divisional structure. Starting from a single product evolving

to a multi-product ﬁrm, this model reproduces a number of empirical observations and make
some predictions which we discuss in detail below along with results and predictions of other
models which attempt to address the problem of business ﬁrm growth.

Consider a ﬁrm i of sales Si with Ni products whose sales are ξi,j where j = 1, 2, ..., Ni.
j=Ni
j=1 ξi,j. The growth

Thus the ﬁrm size in terms of the sales of its products is given as Si =
rate is

P

gi(t) ≡ log

Si(t + ∆t)

(cid:18)

Si(t) (cid:19)

= log Si(t + ∆t) − log Si(t),

(1)

where Si(t) and Si(t + ∆t) are the sales, in units of 103 British Pounds, of ﬁrm i being
considered in the year t and t + ∆t, respectively. Pharmaceutical data has seasonal eﬀect,
and hence the analysis of quarterly data will have eﬀects due to seasonality. To remove any
seasonality, that might be present, we analyze the annual data instead of the quarterly data.
Recent studies have demonstrated power-law scaling in economic systems [6]. In particular
[6] or

the standard deviation σ of the growth rates of diverse systems including ﬁrm sales
gross domestic product (GDP) of countries [7] scales as a power-law of S.

The models of Refs [1–3, 5, 8] all predicts that standard deviation of growth rates amongst
all ﬁrms with the same sales scales as a power law σ(g|S) ∼ S−β. Further, model of Refs [5]
predicts that probability density function PDF p(g|S), of growth rates for a size of ﬁrm S
scales as a function of S as :

1
S−β f0
where f0 is a symmetric function of a speciﬁc “tent-shaped” form resulting from a convolution
a log normal distributions and a Gaussian distribution, with parameters dependent on the
parameters of the model. Figure 1a plots the scaling of the standard deviation σ(g|S). We
observe σ(g|S) ∼ S−β with β = 0.19 ± 0.01. Figure 1b plots the scaled PDF as given by eq. 2
for three sales groups; small (S < 102), medium (102 < S < 104) and large (104 < S). The
ﬁgure also plots f0 as predicted by refs [5]. The model of Ref [5] further predicts that the
PDF of the product size ξ for a ﬁxed ﬁrm size S, ρ1(ξ|S) should scale as

p(g|S) ∼

where again f1 depends on the parameters of the model. According to the model discussed
in Refs [5, 8] f1 is a log-normal PDF. We then evaluate the average product size E(ξ|S) in a
dξρ1(ξ|S)ξ ∼ Sα. Figure 2b plots E(ξ|S), we observe
ﬁrm of size S, deﬁned as E(ξ|S) =
E(ξ|S) ∼ Sα with α = 0.57 ± 0.02. Figure 2b plots the scaled PDF as given by eq. 3 for three
sales groups; small (S < 102), medium (102 < S < 104) and large (104 < S). We observe that
for each of the groups the PDF ρ1(ξ|S) is consistent with a log-normal distribution by noting
in a log-log plot the PDF ρ1(ξ|S) is parabolic which is tested by performing a regression ﬁt.
According to Ref [5], the PDF ρ2(N |S) of number of products N in a ﬁrm of size S should
obey the scaling relation:

R

ρ2(N |S) ∼

1
Sγ f2
where the function f2 is log-normal and depends of the parameters of the model. We evaluate
the average number of products E(N |S) for a ﬁrm of size S. Using eq. 4 we note that
dN ρ1(N |S)N ∼ Sγ. Figure 3a plots the expectation E(N |S) and we observe
E(N |S) =
that E(N |S) ∼ Sγ with γ = 0.42 ± 0.01. Figure 3b plots the scaled PDF ρ2(N |S) as given by
eq. 4 for three groups; small (S < 102), medium (102 < S < 104) and large (104 < S) .

of the model.

which we ﬁnd to be approximately valid for the PHID database.

According to the model discussed in refs [5], the distribution of product sizes in each
ﬁrm scales with the product size at launch Sat launch, according to, ρ0(ξ/Sat launch) which is
approximately log-normal. Model [5] postulates that the PDF of Satlaunch is log normal, i.e.,
P (log Sat launch) is Gaussian with variance Wp and each ﬁrm is characterized by a ﬁxed value
of Sat launch. Furthermore, ref. [5] predicts that the distribution of ﬁrm sales is close to log
normal i.e., the PDF P (log S) is Gaussian with variance Wf . With these hypothesis ref. [5]

Figure 4 plots PDF of annual products sales, products sales at launch P (log Sat launch), and
ﬁrm sales P (log S) between 1990-2001. The variance of the PDF’s of products sales at launch
and ﬁrm sales are estimated to be Wp = 0.88, Wf = 1.72 respectively. This gives β =
(Wf − Wp)/2 Wf = 0.24 which is approximately what is observed empirically. We employ
two methods to estimate W (the standard deviation) : (i) Estimate W from the deﬁnition,
i=N
i.e. W 2 = (1/(N − 1))
i=1 (xi− < x >)2 where {x1, x2, ...xN } is a set of data and < x >
is the mean of the set {xi}. (ii) First estimate the PDF from the set {xi}, then perform a
regression ﬁt with a log-normal function to the PDF. The standard deviation W will be one of
the ﬁtting parameter. Hence estimate W from the estimated parameter value from the least
square log-normal ﬁt to the PDF. We observe both this method gives similar values of W and
the ratio β (cf. eq.7 ) remains unchanged as long as we consistently use one of the 2 methods

three groups which conﬁrms the scaling exponent γ. For small values of N , which also corresponds to
small values of S, the statistics become poor. This statistical errors gets even more ampliﬁed when
we divide small values of N by S0.42. Thus we observe poor quality of data collapse for N/S0.42 < 1.
The data collapse is better for N/S0.42 > 1 where we have good statistics.

described above. Our estimate of W presented here is using the former method.

Ref. [5] postulates products growth rate to be Gaussian and temporally uncorrelated. To
test this postulate ﬁgure 5 plots the PDF P (g) of the growth g of the products ∆t = 1
and ∆t = 10 year [9]. We see that the empirical distribution is not growing via random
multiplicative process as ref. [5] postulates but has the same tent shape distribution as the
distribution of ﬁrm sales growth rate, suggesting that the products themselves may not be
elementary units but maybe comprised of smaller interacting subunits. Figure 5 also plots
PDF P (g′) surrogate data obtained by summation of the 10 annual growth rates from the
empirical distribution. We observe that the P (g∆t=10) for products diﬀers from the surrogate
data implying there are signiﬁcant anti-correlation in the growth dynamics between successive
years.

Fig. 4 – PDF of products sales (diamond) ﬁrm sales (circles) between 1990-2001. The variance of
the PDF’s of products sales at launch and ﬁrm sales are estimated to be Wp = 0.88 and Wf = 1.72
respectively. This gives Wf − Wp = 0.84 and β = 0.24 [cf. eq. 7] which is approximately what is
observed empirically as predicted by [5].

In summary we study the statistical properties of the internal structure of a ﬁrm and
its growth. We identify three scaling exponents relating the (i) sales of the products, ξ (ii)
the number of products, N and (iii) the standard deviation of the growth rates, σ, of a ﬁrm
with its sales S. Our analysis conﬁrms the features predicted in ref [5]. However we ﬁnd
that the postulate of the model namely: the growth rate of the products is uncorrelated and
Gaussian is not accurate. Thus the model of ref. [5] can be regarded as a ﬁrst step towards
the explanation of the dynamics of the ﬁrm growth.

Abstract

A simple model for simulating tug of war game as varying the player number in a team is discussed

to identify the slow pace of fast change. This model shows that a large number of information

sources leads slow change for the system. Also, we introduce an opinion diﬀusion model including

the eﬀect of a high degree of clustering. This model shows that the de facto standard and lock-in

eﬀect, well-known phenomena in economics and business management, can be explained by the

network clusters.

INTRODUCTION

Network models are an active research ﬁeld in recent, and many stylized features, such

as a short average length between nodes, a high clustering coeﬃcient and a power-law

distribution, have been detected in many real network systems in nature and society [1, 2,

3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. The dynamics in small-world and scale-free networks is one of the

recent issues to be addressed in the study of complex networks. A small-world network [1, 4]

is generated by rewiring the links, and the scale-free network introduced by Barab´asi et al.

[2, 6] shows a power-law connectivity distribution. Recently, Klemm et al. [7, 8] introduced

an algorithm for a highly clustered scale-free network model. In particular, these network

models are used to investigate the dynamics of interaction elements in physics, biology,

economics, business management, and many other areas.

Econophysics is one of the most active interdisciplinary ﬁelds [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18,

19, 20]. One of the topics most widely studied at present is complex network models because

real ﬁnancial markets have many interacting agents with a huge amount of information.

In addition, microscopic models including the spin model describe well the properties of

ﬁnancial markets [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. The agents are represented by spins and the interaction

between agents by ﬁelds in the model. This microscopic model is also widely applied to social

systems. In fact, economic and social systems are not very diﬀerent from the viewpoint of

complex networks [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]. There are many interactions and

communications between agents in the network, and these are subject to opinion dynamics.

Thus, complex network theory is a powerful instrument in interdisciplinary areas such as

econophysics. Agent-based models and game theory are useful approaches for investigating

economic and social networks [31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39]. Agent-based models were

ﬁrst considered in the late 1940s. In this type of model, agents with certain properties are

assumed and then simulations are carried out to model real phenomena. In this context, we

investigate opinion diﬀusion in complex networks using agent-based model.

II. TUG OF WAR GAME

In this section, we investigate tug of war game, a simple test of strength which was part

of the Olympic Games from 1900 to 1920, using computer simulation. The game rule is very

2

simple; two teams align themselves at opposite ends of a rope and pull against each other.

In our simulation, the player number in a team is varied from 10 through 10000. Every

player’s original stamina, si(t = 0), is 1.0, and it decays by his or her particular stamina

decay rate γi determined randomly between 0.9 to 1.0. In other words, a player’s stamina is

derived as si(t + 1) = γisi(t). Team strength is simply deﬁned as the sum of the stamina of

all the players in the team. When the strength of one team exceeds that of the other team

by 10%, the winner is determinated and the game is over. If the strength of the two teams

is balanced for a long time, the players become exhausted and the game ends in a draw.

Our game is played within 1000 time steps.

Fig. 1 shows the result of our tug of war game. In this ﬁgure, circles show the number

of time steps required to determinate the winner. However, every game does not have the

winner because some games end in a draw from the long balance of the power. We consider

only the games having the winner to calculate the number of time steps (circles), and deﬁne

the rate of determination (squares in Fig. 1) as the fraction of the game having the winner

over the whole game. For instance, we tested 1000 games between two teams of 10 players,

and got the result that 994 games can determinate the winner. The rate of determination

for this case is 0.994. As the number of players increases, the determination of the winner

becomes more diﬃcult. Even if there is a weak player in one team, the stamina of the other

players can make up for this weak point. These complements are abundant with a large

number of players in the team, and may lead to a greater number of drawn games. When

the game is played between two teams of 10 players each, the winner can be determinated

after three time steps in almost all games. However, in a game with two teams of 10000

players, most games ﬁnish before the winner is determinated because players will be totally

exhausted from the long power struggle between the two teams. Even though the winner

may be determinated by chance, this requires more than 20 time steps. A large number of

players in a team means that we have more factors (agents in this game) to consider and

need more time to calculate including these factors.

This is an example of the slow pace of fast change [40]. Nowadays, the market occasionally

accepts innovations very slowly, despite superior technological advances. The market is

currently huge and is more complex than ever before. The amount of information has

considerably increased and an agent has a large amount of information to consider. It is not

hard to imagine that an agent spends much time thinking and hesitating before making a

decision. Thus, a change in personal decision requires more time than before. In addition,

when an agent has many neighbors, these represent many information providers and the

agent may have problems in handling their information eﬀectively.

If all these neighbors

give the same information even though it is not good, the agent will not change his/her

mind because he/she has only this kind of information. Finally, the neighbors may form

clusters on this basis. Thus, there is a possibility that fast change may proceed at a snail’s

pace in the modern world.

III. OPINION DIFFUSION AND MARKETING STRATEGY

In this section, we investigate additional model rahter diﬀerent from that of the previous

section but related to each other. The N agents in a given network have particular orien-
tations σi(t) = ±1 at discrete time step t. Usually, this spin model is used to study the
ﬁnancial market by physicists as the orientation corresponds to the opinion to sell (−1) or

buy (+1) [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. However, the application of this spin model can be expanded
to social opinion models of binary states such as yes (+1) or no (−1). From now, we de-

scribe this model as a study of the ﬁnancial market for the convenience of description. The

4

orientation of agent i depends on the opinion of his neighbors as follows:

σi(t + 1) = 


+1 with probability p,
−1 with probability 1 − p,

previous studies [17, 18] as:

where j means the neighbors of agent i and M is the number of those neighbors. The log

return (or price change) of the model at time t is

and x(t + 1) is simply derived to tanh x(t). Under this assumption, x(t + 1) is derived as

follows:

x(t + 1) =

σi(t + 1) = 2p − 1 =

N X

eI − e−I
eI + e−I = tanh Ii(t) = tanh x(t),

and x(t) goes to zero as the time ﬂows. However, we redeﬁne the local ﬁeld as

which makes x(t) converge to +1 or -1 because x(t + 1) = tanh Mx(t), and use it because

we investigate famous phenomena, de facto standard and lock-in, and the convergence to

+1 or -1 is more suitable to explain them.

First, we apply this model with 1000 agents to the Watts–Strogatz small-world network

model (the WS model) [4]. However, all agents in the network have the same opinion
and the log return xi(t) rapidly approaches +1 or −1. The long-range interactions of the

network makes opinion diﬀusion very fast and saturation occurs after a few iterations. We

also investigate the Barab´asi–Albert scale-free network model (the BA model) [5, 6], but

the result is similar to that of the WS model.

Recently, an algorithm for the highly clustered scale-free network model (the structured

model), which has several high clusters, was introduced by Klemm et al.

[7]. When we

apply our model to this network model, the result is diﬀerent from those of the WS and BA

models. We ﬁnd a struggle for power between optimists and pessimists due to the clusters

of the network (Fig. 2). Klemm et al. also analyzed the features of self-organizing networks

with scale-free and small-world behaviors as a crossover between the structured model and

the BA model, adjusting the parameter µ (the growing model) [8]. The structured model is

constructed for µ = 0, and the BA model for µ = 1. We show the result with the µ value of
10−3 as a representative of the growing model in Fig. 2.

The result is sensitive to the initial condition. However, the log return of the BA model

always approaches +1 or -1 in a few time steps because the majorities who have one opinion

are formed very rapidly.

In the case of the structured model, the log return reaches a

certain value that is diﬀerent from +1 and -1 because of the struggle between several clusters

consisting of opinion +1 or -1. It also approaches +1 or -1 at the end, but very slowly than

that of the BA model. In addition, sometimes a few agents or clusters change their opinion

6

to the opposite, which leads to jumps in the log return (Fig. 2).

The structured model is basically one-dimension network, which has similar properties

with one-dimension lattice. The number of neighbors who have interactions are small but

the localities strong in the lattice, and the ordered state of the whole system is not appeared.

Thus, the result of the structured model can be from the one-dimensional structure than

the high clusters. To investigate this more detail, we tested our model in the growing model

as varying µ value, and found similar results over the whole areas of the value except when

µ approaches 1. That is why the dot-line (µ = 0, the structured model) and dash-line
(µ = 10−3, the growing model) show similar features, approaching not to +1 or -1 and some

jumps. If a crossover is observed when µ approaches almost 1, it is from the clustered feature

of the network than the one-dimensional structure [41].

The de facto standard is a well-known phenomenon in economics and business manage-

ment [12]. De facto is Latin for ‘in fact’ or ‘in practice’. A de facto standard is one that

everyone seems to follow as an authorized standard, such as Microsoft Windows, Apple iPod,

and VHS, a recording and playing standard for video cassette recorders. Lock-in, a situation

whereby a customer depends on a vendor for products and services and so diﬃcult to move

to another vendor without switching costs, is also well known [12]. When the network is

dominated by the majorities, the majorities can be regarded as the de facto standard. Also,

the convergence of log return to +1 or -1 as lock-in.

The structured and growing models have several clusters, which leads to some diﬀerent

aspects, comparing with the BA and WS models.

In those models, clustering of agents

with the minority opinion can induce and maintain their own market share. At least, the

minorities of those models can have a chance to be the majorities or expand their market

share even though the possibility is low, but not the BA and WS models. When the market is

dominated by one opinion, those who hold another opinion (or products or services) cannot

expand their market share. The distinguished feature of the structured and growing models

from others is the existence of high clusters. This can be applied to marketing strategies

in practice. For example, the success of the Apple iPod began from a few enthusiasts [42].

Of course, clustering cannot guarantee success, but it is not easy to reverse the majority

opinion without a high degree of clustering of customers, especially if there is already a de

facto standard or lock-in.

IV. DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS

We analyzed opinion dynamics in complex networks. First we investigated a simple

tug-of-war game to identify the slow pace of fast change. The result of this game shows

that a great number of information sources leads to hesitation in decision-making and slow

change for the system. If a node in a given network has many neighbors, this node is sub-

ject to a great inﬂux of information. The density of these nodes leads to clustering in the

network, with clusters maintaining their particular opinions against external information.

We examined this property using the microscopic spin model as the opinion model in the

Watts–Strogatz small-world and Barab´asi–Albert scale-free network models. In these com-

plex networks, information diﬀuses through the whole network very rapidly. Most nodes in

the network have the same opinions, which can be explained by a de facto standard, which

everyone seems to follow as an authorized standard in the market, and a lock-in eﬀect,

whereby a customer depends on a vendor for products and services and ﬁnds it very diﬃcult

to move to another vendor. However, the result for the structured and growing scale-free

network model with a high degree of clustering shows obvious diﬀerences. The clustering

may be regarded as groups of enthusiasts who make their own market share against the

majority opinion of the market, the de facto standard or the lock-in.

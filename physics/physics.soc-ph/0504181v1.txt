Modelling the dynamics of youth subcultures

What are the dynamics behind youth subcultures such as punk, hippie, or hip-hop cultures? How does the global
dynamics of these subcultures relate to the individual’s search for a personal identity? We propose a simple
dynamical model to address these questions and ﬁnd that only a few assumptions of the individual’s behaviour
are necessary to regenerate known features of youth culture.

I. INTRODUCTION

One can often distinguish youths from adults, not only by
their faces, but also by their jargon, clothing, gait and pos-
ture. Their relative lack of experience and generally diﬀerent
position in life have probably always separated the youth and
adult worlds (2). The prosperity of Western societies during
the 20th century has postponed the entry of adulthood. This
has increased the importance of youth culture in the search of
identity. It has also diversiﬁed youth culture so that one (in
academia since ref. (11)) speaks of youth subcultures rather
than one youth culture. Whereas “subculture,” in general,
refers to a social group with particular behaviours or beliefs,
this paper speciﬁcally focuses on youth subcultures. Today,
youth subcultures are conspicuous features of Western and
other societies of the world. We note that youth subcultures,
as known in the West, often require some economic strength
from the follower. Many aspects of our discussion are prob-
ably ubiquitous, but to simplify we focus on youth culture in
wealthy democracies. Subcultures may be long lived like the
hip hop or punk cultures, or die out almost as soon as they
have a name. They may be centred on music, sports (such as
the surf or snowboard culture (18)) or literature (such as the
Beat generation (16)), religion (5), etc. The reason a subcul-
ture may ﬂare up and vanish soon is related to that adoles-
cents in search of an identity are very adaptive in terms of the
deﬁning traits of a subculture. An adolescent’s formation of
a personality is both an individual and a social process (4; 9).
For the social part the subcultures often play a major role.
In this study we attempt to model the dynamics of subcul-
tures based on a few assumptions about the rationale behind
the subcultures’ roles in the formation of a personal identity.
Our goal is to observe the skewed distribution of sizes of the
subcultures—like Thornton’s example about the club subcul-
tures of late-eighties Britain: “Hundreds of dance genres are
coined every year. While most fail, acid house prospered.”
(Ref. (21), p. 156.) “Genre” refers to a division of an art form,
in this case club music. Just as music can be classiﬁed hi-
erarchically, one can divide subcultures into sub-subcultures.
Since, in the club music world of Thornton, the subcultural
identity is closely tied to the music, it is natural to associate
the genre with a subculture. This is, of course, a very ﬁne
distinction of a subculture; henceforth, we will not explicitly
state the level of the hierarchy we are discussing, but presume

that the same precepts govern subcultures at all diﬀerent hier-
archical levels. To model youth subcultures is, no doubt, an
exceedingly complex problem; and any approach runs the risk
of either being an over-simpliﬁcation or so complex the actual
mechanisms become indecipherable. Since this question is,
to our knowledge, not earlier addressed, we propose a sim-
ple framework that can easily be extended to more elaborate
future models. We mention that this model can be applied to
diﬀerent social and economic systems. In this paper, however,
we focus solely on the question of youth subcultures.

II. DYNAMICAL MODEL

Our model is based on ﬁve major assumptions: 1. The dy-
namics of the underlying social network is negligible. This
is probably our least realistic assumption—as a youth takes
up a new subculture she, or he, will likely meet and get ac-
quainted with other aﬁcionados. On the other hand, there
are many factors that inhibit the dynamics of one’s social net-
work: the classmates, neighbours and relatives do not change
that rapidly. We anticipate future models that will include an
adaptive network dynamics. For this work we will use static
underlying networks. Some evidence that youth retains some
part of their social network after the entry into adulthood can
be found in Ref. (6). 2. An adolescent belongs to one subcul-
ture at a time. This is natural since, belonging to many sub-
cultures at the same time would conﬂict with the subculture
as a basis for a personal identity. Furthermore, for many sub-
cultures, a member is expected to be devoted to it. That much
said, it is sometimes more appropriate to represent the identi-
ties in a multi-dimensional space (13). Certainly our study can
be extended to incorporate this framework (someone can be a
hip-hopper in a music dimension and a basketball player in
a sports dimension). Note that, if the dimensions are weakly
coupled (interrelated), each dimension can be treated as a sep-
arate, one-dimensional system. For the present study we as-
sume one-dimensional identities. 3. If the fraction of friends
that have adopted a certain subculture is big enough then an
adolescent will adopt that subculture too. This assumption
lies behind much of modelling for the spread of fads (23). It
is known that friends play a great role for an individual’s adop-
tion of subcultures (4; 9). If many friends of a youth follow
a new fad, naturally she, or he, will be interested in the new

thing and may also feel left behind. 4. The attractiveness of
a subculture decreases with its age. Youths do not want to be
old-fashioned, so a subculture on its decline certainly seems
less appealing to potential followers than a subculture on its
rise. 5. There is a certain resistance to changing subcultures.
To take up a subculture requires an eﬀort—one needs to learn
the unstated rules and most likely buy various paraphernalia—
i.e. acquire subcultural capital (21). Then, of course, the fol-
lowers of a subculture like what they are doing, if they are not
tired and dissatisﬁed with what they are doing they would not
change.

“mainstream”—the commercialised culture promoted by
media (2; 21). It has been argued that this dichotomy—the
subcultures vs. the mainstream—is more a way of main-
taining individuality (10) than a relevant social distinction.
In our work we assume the mainstream can be regarded as
a collection or set of subcultures, kindred with the other
subcultures, though in reality of course by far the biggest.
Media (though, by deﬁnition, not the most used channels) has,
of course, a role in the spreading of more obscure subcultures
too. A youth may adopt a subculture only as a result of a
media report. The real situation there is a coupling from
the youth to the media and back again. This paper assumes
the personal coupling is stronger when it comes to identity
formation and thus considers the spread through friends only.

Now we turn to the deﬁnition of our model. We use the
framework of graph theory and consider N vertices connected
pairwise by M edges. The vertices represent the youths and
the edges represent their social ties. At time t the vertex i has a
unique identity, or subculture, c(i, t). Time, in our simulation,
is discrete. It is represented by an integer number from 1 to
tmax (we have tmax = 12800 for all runs of our simulations)
corresponding to the number of the iteration of the update of
c(i, t). The central part of the updating procedure is the score
function sc(t, i) that is intended to represent the attractiveness
of subculture c to person i at time t. If the score-function value
of a subculture c exceeds a threshold T (which is a model pa-
rameter) the individual will replace her/his current subcultural
identity by c. As mentioned, a high number of neighbours
adopting c should make c attractive. We make the simplest
choice and let sc(t, i) be a linear function of ni(c), the number
of neighbours of i with the identity c. That the attractiveness
of a subculture decreases with time is implemented by making
sc(t, i) proportional to the age diﬀerence between c and ci, i’s
current subculture, divided by the current age of ci. The last
ingredient of the score function is a normalisation factor, k/ki,
k = 2M/N is the average degree (number of neighbours of a
vertex) and ki is i’s degree. This factor is included to compen-
sate for the varying degrees, so that the same threshold value
can be used for all vertices. To sum up, the score function is

sc(t, i) =

ni(c)

k
ki

t(c) − t(ci)
t − t(ci)

,

(1)

where t(c) is the age of c (note that if t has no argument it
refers to the current simulation time). The iterations are as
follows:

• For every vertex i (chosen sequentially) calculate the
score sc(t, i) of all subcultures c for the individual i at
time t.

• Go through the vertex set sequentially once again. If the
score is higher than a threshold T for some identity c,
then i change its identity to c. If more than one subcul-
ture has a score above the threshold then the individual
adopts the subculture with the highest score.

• With a probability R a new identity is assigned to a ver-
tex. So, on average, NR fads are introduced per time
step.

III. SUBSTRATE NETWORKS

We will use two kinds of network models as underlying net-
works in our study—one very basic model, the Erd˝os-R´enyi
(ER) model (8; 17); and one modern model of acquaintance
networks, the networked seceder model (10). We note that,
over the last decade, an abundance of network models have

FIG. 2 Examples of network realisations of the ER (a) and the se-
ceder (b) models. Both graphs have N = 50 vertices and M = 150

ﬁed by the algorithm of Ref. (15), by diﬀerent symbols.

been proposed, the reason we chose these two in particular
is that they represent two ends of the spectrum between gen-
erality and speciﬁcity. The ER model is the simplest possi-
ble random graph model—simple in the sense that it is max-
imally random with no structural biases: One iteratively adds
the edges between pairs of vertices so that multiple edges and
loops (self-edges) are avoided.

The seceder model is intended to generate networks with
community structure—densely connected subnetworks (com-
munities) with relatively few connections between the subnet-
works. We will sketch how this model works, for the exact
details we refer to Ref. (10). One starts from an ER model
network and successively rewires (detach one side of an edge
and attach it to some other vertex) the edges according to the
following approximate rules: 1. Choose three vertices. 2. Se-
lect the one i of these with the highest eccentricity (maximal
distance to any other vertex (3)). 3. Choose another vertex
j at random and rewire j’s edges to i and i’s neighbourhood.
4. With a probability r (the only parameter of the seceder
model) re-rewire one of j’s edges to a randomly chosen ver-
tex. With the parameter r one can tune the randomness of the
model—with r = 1 the networks are of ER-type, with r = 0
the community structure is most strongly pronounced.

The ER model networks are characterised by a Poissonian
degree distribution, a vanishing clustering (fraction of trian-
gles) and no pronounced community structure. The seceder
model networks have an exponentially decaying degree distri-
bution, high clustering and strong community structure. Two
example networks are displayed in ﬁg. 2.

IV. SIMULATION RESULTS

To get an impression of how subcultures are born, evolve
and die, we plot the time evolution of the number of adopters
S of diﬀerent fads. One typical run is seen in ﬁg. 3. We
observe that, a subculture can most often be divided into a

growth stage, a quasi-stationary stage and a ﬁnal decline.
We note that this distinction of three stages is rather com-
mon (5; 21). The shape and slope of the growth and decline,
the life-length and the maximal size are all distinct for diﬀer-
ent subcultures. Some fads have more complex time evolution
with more than one quasi-stationary state. The time evolution
for the seceder model is more complex than for the ER model
networks seen in ﬁg. 3. We note that two leading time-scales
of this model are the life-length of subcultures and the mean
time between introductions of new subcultures. If we have a
scale separation (i.e. that, either the life-length is much larger
than the introduction time, or vice versa), then the model can
be simpliﬁed.
In the limit of short time between the intro-
ductions of new subcultures, every individual will have a new
subculture with each time step. In the opposite limit the model
essentially reduces to the threshold model of Watts (23). But
in the real world these two time scales are not separable—
some subcultures may ﬂare up and vanish within the life-span
of others. Our model is thus relevant in this intermediate re-
gion and our choice of R = 1/6400 (that we use throughout the
simulations) as seen in ﬁg. 3, ensures this. Henceforth, we will
study quantities averaged over ∼ 250 realisations of the graph
models, this means that there will be ∼ 250 tmax R N = 500N
fads introduced per point in parameter space.

In ﬁg. 4(a) and (b) we display the distribution plots of the
maximal size of the subculture S max. We see that diﬀerent
threshold values give qualitatively diﬀerent distributions of
S max. For small threshold values p(S max) grows with S max.
This means that most subcultures will, at their peak, aﬀect
most of the population. For small T -values, or T = 0, S max
is decaying sharply (with an exponential tail). For interme-
diate values of T there will be a very broad distribution of
the maximal subculture-size—a situation where some subcul-
tures grow to involve almost every individual, while many oth-
ers die out without gaining many followers. Note that such
a broad distribution is not a trivial result of the introduction
dynamics—a new subculture, in our model, enters the pop-
ulation according to the sharp Poisson-distribution. The two
diﬀerent underlying networks—the ER model of ﬁg. 4(a) and
seceder model of ﬁg. 4(b)—do not cause any qualitatively dif-
ferent behaviour. (This conclusion—that the result is quali-

tatively independent of the underlying network structure—is
conﬁrmed in preliminary tests on diﬀerent network models.)
There seceder model curves are slightly ﬂatter indicating that
there is a larger probability for small subcultures for low T -
values and a larger chance for population wide subcultures if
T is high. A natural explanation for this lies in the community
structure of the seceder model. Since these communities are
highly interlinked, the probability that a vertex is neighbour
to more than one vertex of the same subcultural identity is
higher. Therefore, a new subculture can more easily overcome
the threshold and spread within a community. For the same
reason it is harder for a subculture to spread between com-
munities. The blurring of the curves of ﬁg. 4(b) (compared
with those in ﬁg. 4(a)) is thus to some extent due to the com-
munity structure. This conclusion is consistent with the plots
of the total life time of subcultures tdur shown in ﬁg. 4(c) and
(d). The seceder model curves (ﬁg. 4(c)) shows a broader dis-
tribution of life-lengths than the ER model (ﬁg. 4(d)), which
can be explained by that the fate of a subculture is, to some
extent, determined by the community in which it has started.
Another observation regarding the tdur-distribution is that the
peaks come later on the seceder model. This can be explained
by the higher clustering (fraction of complete triangles with
respect to connected vertex-triples) of the seceder model. A
high clustering gives a correction to the number of individuals
m step away from a given vertex (14)—this number is smaller

subculture is initiated? Intuitively one expects that if the ﬁrst
adopter has higher degree then the subculture has a higher
chance of being a population-wide fad. In ﬁg. 5 we plot the
average peak-size hS maxi as a function of the degree of the
ﬁrst adopter k1. As expected hS maxi(k1) is an (sublinearly) in-
creasing function. If the threshold is lower the inﬂuence of
high-degree vertices increases. This is an eﬀect of the larger
average peak sizes of lower T -values. (For higher T -values
more subcultures coexist, so the peak sizes are smaller but the
life-length longer.)

In addition to the phenomenon that subcultures can be cen-
tral for the formation of a youth’s personal identity, some ado-
lescents shift such characteristics more frequently than others.
This can of course be modelled by a varying threshold, but
may also be an eﬀect of the structure of the social network.
In ﬁg. 6(a) we plot the frequency v of subcultures per indi-
vidual, i.e. the number of subcultures that can be expected to
be adopted during one time step. Since only one new subcul-
ture can be adapted per time step v is also the probability that
an individual will adopt a new identity a particular time step.
We see a sharp peak of v for small k-values. Low-degree ver-
tices are thus, by this property alone, more prone to changing
their identity. In ﬁg. 6(b) we plot v as a function of the ec-
centricity e (the maximal distance to any other vertex in the
network) of the vertex. We observe that v is an increasing

5

function of e. To summarise, individuals that have few ac-
quaintances and are peripheral in the social networks changes
identity more often. One observation in favour of this ﬁnding
is Thornton’s study (21) of British club cultures where many
adopters change as soon as a speciﬁc style has been adopted
by the mainstream. Apart from this we have not found any
empirical observations of this phenomenon. Even if the non-
constant v of ﬁg. 6 would be dismissed as an artifact of our
model, it still exempliﬁes that it is not only individual char-
acteristics that create the social network—one’s identity may
also be formed by the social network structure.

V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We have presented a model for how subcultures spread in
a population of adolescents. Using ﬁve main assumptions of
a youth’s response to the subcultures of others to whom they
are socially close, we construct dynamical rules for subculture
diﬀusion. This dynamical model is then put on networks in-
tended to represent acquaintance ties. The model is sketchy,
but contains, we believe, many of the important mechanisms
for the evolution of the youth subcultures. Even if each indi-
vidual has a very complex rationale for her, or his, response
to the social environment, the fact that individuals, on aver-
age, respond in certain ways makes it possible for only a few
mechanisms to govern the system-wide properties (19). One
problem with the particular question we address, is the lack of
quantitative empirical data. Unlike the related issue of mem-
berships in voluntary organisations (12) an adolescent is not
required to register in any way. One can, as we do, compare
qualitative model behaviour with qualitative observations. But
for future studies it should be possible to perform quantita-
tive studies; either directly by longitudinal interview surveys,
or indirectly by e.g. measuring the frequency of related key
words in the press.

One characteristic our model shares with real world obser-
vations is that, for certain parameter values, a few subcultures
have a much larger staying-power than the average, whereas
most subcultures die out very soon. The punk music scene of
the 1970’s (11) is an example of a long-lived and large subcul-
ture. The other end, that of short-lived and small subcultures,
is less well-deﬁned: one can imagine peculiar habits of a cir-
cle of friends, maybe even one person, to deﬁne a subculture.
Such short-lived fads can be great in number and still remain
largely unheard of just because the total number of practition-
ers is small. We ﬁnd that the maximal size of the networks
is strongly correlated with the degree of the ﬁrst adopter. An-
other outcome of our model is that fringe groups change iden-
tity more frequently than central and well-connected vertices.
This may or may not reﬂect a real situation, but it serves as
an example of how traits of individuals can result from the so-
cial structure, as well as vice versa. The qualitative behaviour
of our dynamical rules is the same for our two network mod-
els. This means that the result is stable for moderate changes
of the underlying network topology, and therefore is likely to
remain valid for large ranges of real social networks.

Many studies separate subcultures and the commercialised

mainstream youth cultures. It has been argued that this di-
chotomy, rather than being an accurate social description,
stems from members of smaller subcultures and their need
to proﬁle themselves as diﬀerent opposed to a larger main-
stream culture (21). In our model, we would like to interpret
the largest subcultures as forming the mainstream. Naturally,
these subcultures, rather than smaller subcultures, tend to be
the focus of commercial interests.

Many extension and versions of this and similar threshold
models are possible. We anticipate future work proposing, just
as we (in this paper) and e.g. Ref. (22) do, ﬁne tuned models
for information dissemination on more speciﬁc social systems
than more general sociodynamic models of e.g. information
diﬀusion and opinion formation (see e.g. Refs. (1; 7; 20) and
references therein).

Abstract

The difﬁculties involved in spelling er-
ror detection and correction in a lan-
guage have been investigated in this work
through the conceptualization of SpellNet
– the weighted network of words, where
edges indicate orthographic proximity be-
tween two words. We construct SpellNets
for three languages - Bengali, English and
Hindi. Through appropriate mathemati-
cal analysis and/or intuitive justiﬁcation,
we interpret the different topological met-
rics of SpellNet from the perspective of
the issues related to spell-checking. We
make many interesting observations, the
most signiﬁcant among them being that
the probability of making a real word error
in a language is propotionate to the aver-
age weighted degree of SpellNet, which is
found to be highest for Hindi, followed by
Bengali and English.

1 Introduction

Spell-checking is a well researched area in NLP,
which deals with detection and automatic correc-
tion of spelling errors in an electronic text docu-
ment. Several approaches to spell-checking have
been described in the literature that use statistical,
rule-based, dictionary-based or hybrid techniques
(see (Kukich, 1992) for a dated but substantial sur-
vey). Spelling errors are broadly classiﬁed as non-
word errors (NWE) and real word errors (RWE). If
the misspelt string is a valid word in the language,
then it is called an RWE, else it is an NWE. For ex-
ample, in English, the word “fun” might be misspelt

as “gun” or “vun”; while the former is an RWE, the
latter is a case of NWE. It is easy to detect an NWE,
but correction process is non-trivial. RWE, on the
other hand are extremely difﬁcult to detect as it re-
quires syntactic and semantic analysis of the text,
though the difﬁculty of correction is comparable to
that of NWE (see (Hirst and Budanitsky, 2005) and
references therein).

Given a lexicon of a particular language, how
hard is it to develop a perfect spell-checker for that
language? Since context-insensitive spell-checkers
cannot detect RWE and neither they can effec-
tively correct NWE, the difﬁculty in building a per-
fect spell-checker, therefore, is reﬂected by quan-
tities such as the probability of a misspelling be-
ing RWE, probability of more than one word be-
ing orthographically closer to an NWE, and so
on.
In this work, we make an attempt to under-
stand and formalize some of these issues related to
the challenges of spell-checking through a complex
network approach (see (Albert and Barab´asi, 2002;
Newman, 2003) for a review of the ﬁeld). This in
turn allows us to provide language-speciﬁc quan-
titative bounds on the performance level of spell-
checkers.

In order to formally represent the orthographic
structure (spelling conventions) of a language, we
conceptualize the lexicon as a weighted network,
where the nodes represent the words and the weights
of the edges indicate the orthoraphic similarity be-
tween the pair of nodes (read words) they connect.
We shall call this network the Spelling Network
or SpellNet for short. We build the SpellNets for
three languages – Bengali, English and Hindi, and
carry out standard topological analysis of the net-
works following complex network theory. Through

appropriate mathematical analysis and/or intuitive
justiﬁcation, we interpret the different topological
metrics of SpellNet from the perspective of difﬁ-
culties related to spell-checking. Finally, we make
several cross-linguistic observations, both invari-
ances and variances, revealing quite a few inter-
esting facts. For example, we see that among the
three languages studied, the probability of RWE is
highest in Hindi followed by Bengali and English.
A similar observation has been previously reported
in (Bhatt et al., 2005) for RWEs in Bengali and En-
glish.

Apart from providing insight into spell-checking,
the complex structure of SpellNet also reveals the
self-organization and evolutionary dynamics under-
lan-
lying the orthographic properties of natural
guages.
In recent times, complex networks have
been successfully employed to model and explain
the structure and organization of several natural
and social phenomena, such as the foodweb, pro-
tien interaction,
formation of language invento-
ries (Choudhury et al., 2006), syntactic structure of
languages (i Cancho and Sol´e, 2004), WWW, social
collaboration, scientiﬁc citations and many more
(see (Albert and Barab´asi, 2002; Newman, 2003)
and references therein).
This work is inspired
by the aforementioned models, and more specif-
ically a couple of similar works on phonological
neighbors’ network of words (Kapatsinski, 2006;
Vitevitch, 2005), which try to explain the human
perceptual and cognitive processes in terms of the
organization of the mental lexicon.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Sec-
tion 2 deﬁnes the structure and construction pro-
cedure of SpellNet. Section 3 and 4 describes the
degree and clustering related properties of Spell-
Net and their signiﬁcance in the context of spell-
checking, respectively. Section 5 summarizes the
ﬁndings and discusses possible directions for future
work. The derivation of the probability of RWE in a
language is presented in Appendix A.

2 SpellNet: Deﬁnition and Construction

In order to study and formalize the orthographic
characteristics of a language, we model the lexicon
Λ of the language as an undirected and fully con-
nected weighted graph G(V, E). Each word w ∈ Λ

Figure 1: The structure of SpellNet: (a) the weighted
SpellNet for 6 English words, (b) Thresholded coun-
terpart of (a), for θ = 1

is represented by a vertex vw ∈ V , and for every
pair of vertices vw and vw′ in V , there is an edge
(vw, vw′) ∈ E. The weight of the edge (vw, vw′), is
equal to ed(w, w′) – the orthographic edit distance
between w and w′ (considering substitution, dele-
tion and insertion to have a cost of 1). Each node
vw ∈ V is also assigned a node weight WV (vw)
equal to the unigram occurrence frequency of the
word w. We shall refer to the graph G(V, E) as the
SpellNet. Figure 1(a) shows a hypothetical SpellNet
for 6 common English words.

For a threshold θ,

We deﬁne unweighted versions of the graph
G(V, E) through the concept of thresholding as
described below.
the graph
Gθ(V, Eθ) is an unweighted sub-graph of G(V, E),
where an edge (vw, vw′) ∈ E is assigned a weight 1
in Eθ if and only if the weight of the edge is less than
or equal to θ, else it is assigned a weight 0. In other
words, Eθ consists of only those edges in E whose
edge weight is less than or equal to θ. Note that all
the edges in Eθ are unweighted. Figure 1(b) shows
the thresholded SpellNet shown in 1(a) for θ = 1.

2.1 Construction of SpellNets

We construct the SpellNets for three languages –
Bengali, English and Hindi. While the two Indian
languages – Bengali and Hindi – use Brahmi derived
scripts – Bengali and Devanagari respectively, En-
glish uses the Roman script. Moreover, the orthog-
raphy of the two Indian languages are highly phone-
mic in nature, in contrast to the morpheme-based or-
thography of English. Another point of disparity lies
in the fact that while the English alphabet consists

been taken from public sources.
For En-
glish it has been obtained from the website
www.audiencedialogue.org/susteng.html; for Hindi
and Bengali, the word lists as well as the unigram
frequencies have been estimated from the mono-
lingual corpora published by Central Institute of
Indian Languages. We chose to work with the most
frequent 10000 words, as the medium size of the
two Indian language corpora (around 3M words
each) does not provide sufﬁcient data for estimation
of the unigram frequencies of a large number
of words (say 50000). Therefore, all the results
described in this work pertain to the SpellNets
corresponding to the most frequent 10000 words.
However, we believe that the trends observed do not
reverse as we increase the size of the networks.

In this paper, we focus on the networks at three
different thresholds, that is for θ = 1, 3, 5, and study
the properties of Gθ for the three languages. We
do not go for higher thresholds as the networks be-
come completely connected at θ = 5. Table 1 re-
ports the values of different topological metrics of
the SpellNets for the three languages at three thresh-
olds. In the following two sections, we describe in
detail some of the topological properties of Spell-
Net, their implications to spell-checking, and obser-
vations in the three languages.

3 Degree Distribution

The degree of a vertex in a network is the num-
ber of edges incident on that vertex. Let Pk be the
probability that a randomly chosen vertex has de-
gree k or more than k. A plot of Pk for any given
network can be formed by making a histogram of
the degrees of the vertices, and this plot is known
as the cumulative degree distribution of the net-
work (Newman, 2003). The (cumulative) degree
distribution of a network provides important insights
into the topological properties of the network.

Figure 2 shows the plots for the cumulative de-
gree distribution for θ = 1, 3, 5, plotted on a log-
linear scale. The linear nature of the curves in
the semi-logarithmic scale indicates that the dis-
tribution is exponential in nature. The exponen-

tial behaviour is clearly visible for θ = 1, how-
ever at higher thresholds, there are very few nodes
in the network with low degrees, and therefore
only the tail of the curve shows a pure exponen-
tial behavior. We also observe that the steepness
slope) of the log(Pk) with respect to k in-
(i.e.
creases with θ.
It is interesting to note that al-
though most of the naturally and socially occurring
networks exhibit a power-law degree distribution
(see (Albert and Barab´asi, 2002; Newman, 2003;
i Cancho and Sol´e, 2004; Choudhury et al., 2006)
and references therein), SpellNets feature exponen-
tial degree distribution. Nevertheless, similar results
have also been reported for the phonological neigh-
bors’ network (Kapatsinski, 2006).

3.1 Average Degree

Let the degree of the node v be denoted by k(v). We
deﬁne the quantities – the average degree hki and the
weighted average degree hkwti for a given network
as follows (we drop the subscript w for clarity of
notation).

hki =

k(v)

1
N

X
v∈V

hkwti = Pv∈V k(v)WV (v)

Pv∈V WV (v)

(2)

where N is the number of nodes in the network.

Implication: The average weighted degree of
SpellNet can be interpreted as the probability of
RWE in a language. This correlation can be derived
as follows. Given a lexicon Λ of a language, it can
be shown that the probability of RWE in a language,
denoted by prwe(Λ) is given by the following equa-
tion (see Appendix A for the derivation)

prwe(Λ) = X

Let neighbor(w, d) be the number of words in Λ
whose edit distance from w is d. Eqn 3 can be rewrit-
ten in terms of neighbor(w, d) as follows.

on a word is always small (usually assumed to
be 1 or a slowly growing function of the word
length (Kukich, 1992)). Let us denote this bound by
θ. Therefore,

the degree of the node vw, in Gθ. Moreover, the term
p(w) is proportionate to the node weight WV (vw).
Thus, rewriting Eqn 6 in terms of the network pa-

Comparing Eqn 2 with the above equation, we can
directly obtain the relation

prwe(Λ) < C1hkwti

where C1 is some constant of proportionality. Note
that for θ = 1, prwe(Λ) ∝ hkwti.
If we ignore
the distribution of the words, that is if we assume
p(w) = 1/N , then prwe(Λ) ∝ hki.

Thus, the quantity hkwti provides a good estimate

of the probability of RWE in a language.

Figure 3: Scatter-plots for degree versus unigram
frequency at different θ for Hindi

Observations and Inference: At θ = 1, the av-
erage weighted degrees for Hindi, Bengali and En-
glish are 13.81, 7.73 and 6.61 respectively. Thus, the
probability of RWE in Hindi is signiﬁcantly higher
than that of Bengali, which in turn is higher than
that of English (Bhatt et al., 2005). Similar trends
are observed at all the thresholds for both hkwti and
hki. This is also evident from Figures 2, which show
the distribution of Hindi to lie above that of Bengali,
which lies above English (for all thresholds).

The average degree hki is substantially smaller
(0.5 to 0.33 times) than the average weighted de-
gree hkwti for all the 9 SpellNets. This suggests
that the higher degree nodes in SpellNet have higher
node weight (i.e. occurrence frequency). Indeed, as
shown in Figure 3 for Hindi, the high unigram fre-
quency of a node implies higher degree, though the
reverse is not true. The scatter-plots for the other
languages are similar in nature.

3.2 Correlation between Degrees of Neighbors

The relation between the degrees of adjacent words
is described by the degree assortativity coefﬁcient.
One way to deﬁne the assortativity of a network is
through the Pearson correlation coefﬁcient between
the degrees of the two vertices connected by an edge.
Each edge (u, v) in the network adds a data item
corresponding to the degrees of u and v to two data
sets x and y respectively. The Pearson correlation
coefﬁcient for the data sets x and y of n items each
is then deﬁned as

r =

n P xy − P x P y
p[n P x2 − (P x)2][n P y2 − (P y)2]

Observation: r is positive for the networks in
which words tend to associate with other words of
similar degree (i.e. high degree with high degree
and vice versa), and it is negative for networks in
which words associate with words having degrees
in the opposite spectrum. Refering to table 1, we
see that the correlation coefﬁcient rdd is roughly the
same and equal to around 0.7 for all languages at
θ = 1. As θ increases, the correlation decreases as
expected, due to the addition of edges between dis-
similar words.

Implication: The high positive correlation coefﬁ-
cients suggest that SpellNets feature assortative mix-
ing of nodes in terms of degrees. If there is an RWE
corresponding to a high degree node vw, then due
to the assortative mixing of nodes, the misspelling
w′ obtained from w, is also expected to have a high
degree. Since w′ has a high degree, even after detec-
tion of the fact that w′ is a misspelling, choosing the
right suggestion (i.e. w) is extremely difﬁcult un-
less the linguistic context of the word is taken into
account. Thus, more often than not it is difﬁcult to
correct an RWE, even after successful detection.

4 Clustering and Small World Properties

In the previous section, we looked at some of the de-
gree based features of SpellNets. These features pro-
vide us insights regarding the probability of RWE in
a language and the level of difﬁculty in correcting
In this section, we discuss some of the

other characteristics of SpellNets that are useful in
predicting the difﬁculty of non-word error correc-
tion.

4.1 Clustering Coefﬁcient

Recall that in the presence of a complete list of valid
words in a language, detection of NWE is a trivial
task. However, correction of NWE is far from triv-
ial. Spell-checkers usually generate a suggestion list
of possible candidate words that are within a small
edit distance of the misspelling. Thus, correction be-
comes hard as the number of words within a given
edit distance from the misspelling increases. Sup-
pose that a word w ∈ Λ is transformed into w′ due
to some typing error, such that w′ /∈ Λ. Also assume
that ed(w, w′) ≤ θ. We want to estimate the number
of words in Λ that are within an edit distance θ of

w′. In other words we are interested in ﬁnding out
the degree of the node vw′ in Gθ, but since there is
no such node in SpellNet, we cannot compute this
quantity directly. Nevertheless, we can provide an
approximate estimate of the same as follows.

Let us conceive of a hypothetical node vw′. By
deﬁnition of SpellNet, there should be an edge con-
necting vw′ and vw in Gθ. A crude estimate of
k(vw′) can be hkwti of Gθ. Due to the assortative
nature of the network, we expect to see a high corre-
lation between the values of k(vw) and k(vw′), and
therefore, a slightly better estimate of k(vw′) could
be k(vw). However, as vw′ is not a part of the net-
work, it’s behavior in SpellNet may not resemble
that of a real node, and such estimates can be grossly
erroneous.

One way to circumvent this problem is to look
at the local neighborhood of the node vw. Let us
ask the question – what is the probability that two
randomly chosen neighbors of vw in Gθ are con-
nected to each other? If this probability is high, then
we can expect the local neighborhood of vw to be
dense in the sense that almost all the neighbors of
vw are connected to each other forming a clique-like
local structure. Since vw′ is a neighbor of vw, it is
a part of this dense cluster, and therefore, its degree
k(vw′) is of the order of k(vw). On the other hand,
if this probability is low, then even if k(vw) is high,
the space around vw is sparse, and the local neigh-
borhood is star-like. In such a situation, we expect
k(vw′) to be low.

The topological property that measures the prob-
ability of the neighbors of a node being connected
is called the clustering coefﬁcient (CC). One of the
ways to deﬁne the clustering coefﬁcient C(v) for a
vertex v in a network is

C(v) =

number of triangles connected to vertex v
number of triplets centered on v

For vertices with degree 0 or 1, we put C(v) = 0.
Then the clustering coefﬁcient for the whole net-
work hCCi is the mean CC of the nodes in the net-
work. A corresponding weighted version of the CC
hCCwti can be deﬁned by taking the node weights
into account.

Implication:

k(vw)C(vw) for a node, the higher is the probability

due to the presence of a large number of ortho-
graphic neighbors of the misspelling. Therefore,
in a way hCCwti reﬂects the level of difﬁculty in
correcting NWE for the language in general.

Observation and Inference: At threshold 1,
the values of hCCi as well as hCCwti is higher
for Hindi (0.172 and 0.341 respectively) and Ben-
gali (0.131 and 0.229 respectively) than that of En-
glish (0.101 and 0.221 respectively),
though for
higher thresholds, the difference between the CC
for the languages reduces. This observation further
strengthens our claim that the level of difﬁculty in
spelling error detection and correction are language
dependent, and for the three languages studied, it is
hardest for Hindi, followed by Bengali and English.

4.2 Small World Property

As an aside, it is interesting to see whether the Spell-
Nets exhibit the so called small world effect that is
prevalent in many social and natural systems (see
(Albert and Barab´asi, 2002; Newman, 2003)
for
deﬁnition and examles). A network is said to be a
small world if it has a high clustering coefﬁcient and
if the average shortest path between any two nodes
of the network is small.

Observation: We observe that SpellNets indeed
feature a high CC that grows with the threshold. The
average shortest path, denoted by hli in Table 1, for
θ = 1 is around 7 for all the languages, and reduces
to around 3 for θ = 3; at θ = 5 the networks are
near-cliques. Thus, SpellNet is a small world net-
work.

Implication: By the application of triangle in-
equality of edit distance, it can be easily shown that
hli × θ provides an upper bound on the average edit
distance between all pairs of the words in the lexi-
con. Thus, a small world network, which implies a
small hli, in turn implies that as we increase the error
bound (i.e. θ), the number of edges increases sharply
in the network and soon the network becomes fully
connected. Therefore, it becomes increasingly more
difﬁcult to correct or detect the errors, as any word
can be a possible suggestion for any misspelling. In
fact this is independently observed through the ex-
ponential rise in M – the number of edges, and fall
in hli as we increase θ.

Inference: It is impossible to correct very noisy
texts, where the nature of the noise is random and

words are distorted by a large edit distance (say 3 or
more).

5 Conclusion

In this work, we have proposed the network of ortho-
graphic neighbors of words or the SpellNet and stud-
ied the structure of the same across three languages.
We have also made an attempt to relate some of the
topological properties of SpellNet to spelling error
distribution and hardness of spell-checking in a lan-
guage. The important observations of this study are
summarized below.

• The probability of RWE in a language can
be equated to the average weighted degree of
SpellNet. This probablity is highest in Hindi
followed by Bengali and English.

• In all the languages, the words that are more
prone to undergo an RWE are more likely to be
misspelt. Effectively, this makes RWE correc-
tion very hard.

• The hardness of NWE correction correlates
with the weighted clustering coefﬁcient of the
network. This is highest for Hindi, followed by
Bengali and English.

• The basic topology of SpellNet seems to be an
invariant across languages. For example, all
the networks feature exponential degree distri-
bution, high clustering, assortative mixing with
respect to degree and node weight, small world
effect and positive correlation between degree
and node weight, and CC and degree. However,
the networks vary to a large extent in terms of
the actual values of some of these metrics.

Arguably,

the language-invariant properties of
SpellNet can be attributed to the organization of
the human mental lexicon (see (Kapatsinski, 2006)
and references therein), self-organization of ortho-
graphic systems and certain properties of edit dis-
tance measure. The differences across the lan-
guages, perhaps, are an outcome of the speciﬁc or-
thographic features, such as the size of the alphabet.
Another interesting observation is that the phonemic
nature of the orthography strongly correlates with
the difﬁculty of spell-checking. Among the three

languages, Hindi has the most phonemic and En-
glish the least phonemic orthography. This corre-
lation calls for further investigation.

Throughout the present discussion, we have fo-
cussed on spell-checkers that ignore the context;
consequently, many of the aforementioned results,
especially those involving spelling correction, are
valid only for context-insensitive spell-checkers.
Nevertheless, many of the practically useful spell-
checkers incorporate context information and the
current analysis on SpellNet can be extended for
such spell-checkers by conceptualizing a network
of words that capture the word co-occurrence pat-
terns (Biemann, 2006). The word co-occurrence
network can be superimposed on SpellNet and the
properties of the resulting structure can be appro-
priately analyzed to obtain similar bounds on hard-
ness of context-sensitive spell-checkers. We deem
this to be a part of our future work. Another way
to improve the study could be to incorporate a more
realistic measure for the orthographic similarity be-
tween the words. Nevertheless, such a modiﬁcation
will have no effect on the analysis technique, though
the results of the analysis may be different from the
ones reported here.

discussion, we shall assume a unigram language
model, where p(w) is the normalized frequency of
occurrence of w in a standard corpus.

We deﬁne the probability of RWE for a word w,

prwe(w), as follows

p(w′|w)

(10)

prwe(w) = X
w′∈Λ
w6=w′

Stated differently, prwe(w) is a measure of the prob-
ability that while passing through the channel, w
gets transformed into a form w′, such that w′ ∈ Λ
and w′
6= w. The probability of RWE in the lan-
guage, denoted by prwe(Λ), can then be deﬁned in
terms of the probability prwe(w) as follows.

prwe(w)p(w)

In order to obtain an estimate of the likelihood
p(w′|w), we use the concept of edit distance (also
known as Levenstein distance (Levenstein, 1965)).
We shall denote the edit distance between two words
w and w′ by ed(w, w′). If we assume that the proba-
bility of a single error (i.e. a character deletion, sub-
stitution or insertion) is ρ and errors are independent
of each other, then we can approximate the likeli-
hood estimate as follows.

p(w′|w) = ρed(w,w′)

(12)

Exponentiation of edit distance is a common mea-
sure of word similarity or likelihood (see for exam-
ple (Bailey and Hahn, 2001)).

Substituting for p(w′|w) in Eqn 11, we get

prwe(Λ) = X

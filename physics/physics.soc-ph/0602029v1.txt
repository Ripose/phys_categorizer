Comment on A.-L. Barabasi, Nature 435 207-211 (2005)

February 2, 2008

The purpose of this communication is twofold. First, it clariﬁes the origin of the power law
obtained in the computer simulations presented in A.-L. Barabasi, Nature 435 207-211 (2005)
as well as presenting a statistically more sound analysis of the experimental email data used
in that paper and in [4]. The second purpose is to clarify the origin of the the suggestion of
power law probability distribution for the response times of humans presented with a piece of
new information either as a news event or through the reception of an email.

In a letter in Nature published May 2005 [1], A.-L. Barabasi presents results from an email
experiment[2], which suggest that the time lag τ between the reception of an email and the
following reply for an individual follows a power law probability distribution

P (τ ) ∼ τ −1,

(1)

(2)

when averaged over time. Only a single example(user) is shown and the claimed scaling region
is extremely limited.

At the conference “Frontier Science 2003 - A Non-Linear World: The Real World” in Pavia,
Italy, Sept. 2003, where A.-L. Barabasi also was present and more than one year prior to the
submission of [1] to Nature, I showed with high statistical signiﬁcance, i.e., much higher than
that of [1], using the same data set of [2], that when averaged over both time and population
the time lag τ follows a power law probability distribution

P (τ ) ∼ (τ + c)−1,

where the reason behind the constant c is simply that the computer time lag measured is not
the true response time1. The prime reason for the “shift” c is that most people do not down-
load and/or read new e-mail messages instantaneously. Not only is the statistical signiﬁcance
substantially higher compared with [1] because of the population averaging, but also because
the cumulative distribution of measurements were used thus ﬁltering out much of the high-
frequency (Integration eﬀectively result in a low-pass ﬁltering). The deviation between the
data and the logarithmic ﬁt for long times can be attributed to to limitations in peoples ability
to answer a large number of email, i.e., a ﬁnite size eﬀect due to a limited amount of time and
1A quite crude approximation is made here as the time-lag c is taken to be the same for all individuals. This

explains the small deviation between the data and the ﬁt for the smallest times

memory, as well as under-sampling for large time lags due to the limited population considered.
One should note that an alternative explanation for the response times of a single individual
has been proposed using a log-normal distribution [3]. My main objection to their suggestion,
is that I do not know how to interpret the underlying Gaussian distributed log(variable).

These ﬁndings was later published in the conference proceedings [4] of Feb. 2004, see ﬁg.
1 for the data analysis. Here it was compared with previous results from another Internet
experiment [5], where a portion of the “internaut population”’s response to a forty minute
interview with the author on the origin of stock market crashes called “The World (Not)
According to GARCH” was published on Friday the 26th of May 2000 on a “radio website”
called “Wall Street Uncut” [7]. In this interview, as well as on the website, the URL to the
author’s papers [6] was announced making it clear that work on stock market crashes in general
and the recent Nasdaq crash in particular could be found on the posted URL. The results was
that the response to the interview and URL publication, measured as the number of downloads
of papers from the authors homepage as a function of time (days) from the appearance of the
interview, also followed a power law probability distribution

P (τ ) ∼ τ

−1 + k,

(3)

see ﬁg. 2 for the data analysis. The constant k is simply a “background” due to downloads
from people unaware of the interview as well as “search robots”. Another experiment of the
same type can be found in [9], where the sampled time interval is 100 days. Here the exponent
was found to be ∼ −0.6 and not −1 suggesting that multiple communication channels might
inﬂuence the value of the exponent.

Even though the two experiments are not identical, there are a number of similarities which
establish a correspondence between the two. At any time t after the appearance of the interview
on [7], the exposed population consists of two groups, namely those who have not downloaded
a paper from [6] and those who have. Similarly with respect to the email experiment, at any
time t the population considered consists of two groups, namely those who have an e-mail to
answer and those who have not. In both cases, the time lag τ = t − t0, where t0 is the time of
the appearance of the interview/reception of an email to answer, is the governing variable. The
transition from the ﬁrst state (no action yet) to the second state (have downloaded/answered
email) demands the crossing of some threshold speciﬁc to each individual. We thus imag-
ine that the announcement of the URL/the reception of e-mails plays the role a “ﬁeld” to
which the exposed population is subjected and study the relaxation process by monitoring the
number of downloads/the number of replies as a function of time. Hence, we may view the
process of downloading/replying as a diﬀusion process in a random potential, where the act of
downloading/replying is similar to that of barrier-crossings.

In fact, the queuing model proposed by A.-L. Barabasi in [1] is not much more than a
reformulation of the Trap-model proposed by myself and co-author in [9] and subsequent papers
[5, 4] as an analog to the experiments. Both models use the ad hoc assumption of a power law
“trapping time” distribution p(τ ) ∝ τ γ and introducing a “priority parameter” [1] does not add
much new. With respect to his computer simulation, it is well-known that a uniformly random
sampling of an exponentially distributed random variable will trivially give a power law with
exponent of -1 [10], so it is not obvious what his computer simulations are suppose to prove.

In the conference proceeding [4], I speculate over the origin of such power law response times
distributions and speciﬁcally whether it is a consequence of the averaging over a population or
whether it over time holds on the individual level as well. I list a number of purely qualitative
arguments suggesting that this might be the case, but conclude that “it seems a priori a
quite formidable task to empirically verify whether these considerations are valid or not” with
suﬃcient statistical signiﬁcance. In [1], this problem have not been solved at all.

In conclusion, the only diﬀerence between the experimental results suggesting a power law
distribution of response times presented ﬁrst in [4] and approximately a year later in [1], is that
the former employs an ensemble averaging whereas the latter does not. Considering the quite
limited scaling region of ﬁgure 2b in [1] as well as the scatter of the points, the author’s conclu-
sion that eq.(1) holds for a single individual is not obvious, but certainly interesting. Compared
with this, the scaling region in ﬁg. 1 is over 3 decades. I sincerely hope that A.-L. Barabasi in
the future will give due credit to reference [4] and that Nature’s editors and reviewers in the
future will follow standard academic procedures for referencing background material. In fact, in
2000, the ﬁrst experimental results on human response times on a news event, speciﬁcally that
of an interview published in one of the leading danish newspapers including the author’s URL
[9], showing a power law distribution of response times was submitted to Nature and rejected
on the grounds of “too many papers on the Internet”.

Figure 1: Cumulative distribution of responses as a function of time. The ﬁt is N (t) =
a ln ((t + c) /b) with a ≈ 0.14, b ≈ 0.21 hours and c ≈ 0.25 hours. Due to the “wiggles”, the ﬁt
has been stabilized by ﬁrst estimating c from the data and then ﬁtting a and b keeping c ﬁxed.
The origin of the “wiggles” is simply that people send e-mail messages just before leaving their
work place. Since people generally share the same working hours (provided that they live in
the same time zone), those messages are not answered before the next day.

Abstract

It is widely known that one-lane traﬃc models with slow-to-start
rule exhibit phase separation and metastability.
In this paper, we
show that no metastable states exist in the two-lane version of the
VDR model. We show also that the structure of the steady state
as well as its corresponding relaxation dynamics depend on the lane-
changing probability pch. Moreover, the relaxation time τ diverges as
the form of a power-law : τ ∝ p

Recently cellular automata (CA) traﬃc models are used enormously in
order to understand the complex dynamic behavior of the traﬃc in roadways
(see the review [1]). In CA, time and space are discrete. The space is rep-
resented as a uniform lattice of cells with ﬁnite number of states, subject to
a uniform set of rules, which drives the behavior of the system. These rules
compute the state of a particular cell as a function of its previous state and
the state of the neighboring cells. The most popular CA model for traﬃc
ﬂow on one-lane roadway is the NaSch model [2]. Despite its simplicity, the
model is capable of capturing some essential features observed in realistic
traﬃc like density waves or spontaneous formation of traﬃc jams. To de-
scribe more complex situations such as multi-lane traﬃc, extensions of the
NaSch model have been proposed where additional rules are added for lane
changing cars.
Barlovic et al [3] found metastable states in their velocity dependent ran-
domization (VDR) which is an extension of the NaSch model. The VDR
model belongs to the class of CA models with ”slow-to-start” rules. These
models show an hysteresis eﬀect which is a consequence of the non-unique de-
pendence of the ﬂow on the density. To establish the existence of metastable
states, Barlovic et al started their simulations of the VDR model from two
diﬀerent initial conﬁgurations, the megajam and the homogenous state. The
megajam consists of one large compact cluster of standing cars. In the ho-
mogenous state, cars are distributed periodically with equal constant gap
between successive cars (with one lager gap for incommensurate densities).
If the initial conﬁguration is homogeneous, one obtains the upper branch, in
which each car moves freely with velocity. This upper branch is metastable
with an extremely long life-time. If the initial conﬁguration is megajam, one
obtains the lower branch which is phase separated. The phase separated state
consists of a large jam (jammed region) and a free-ﬂow region where each car
moves freely. As vehicular traﬃc usually evolved in multi-lane roads, some
interesting question is not yet studied. Does multi-lane version of the VDR
model exhibits metastable states ?
The NaSch model with VDR rule is a one-dimensional probabilistic CA which
consists of N cars moving on a one-dimensional lattice of L cells with peri-
odic boundary conditions (the number of vehicles is conserved). Each cell is
either empty, or occupied by just one vehicle with velocity v = 1, 2, ..., vmax.
We denote by xk and vk the position and the velocity of the kth car at time
t respectively. The number of empty cells in front of the kth car is denoted
by dk = xk+1 − xk − 1 and called hereafter as the gap. Space and time are

2

discrete. At each discrete time-step t → t+1 the system update is performed
in parallel for all cars according to the following four subrules :
R1: VDR, p(vk) = p0 for vk = 0 and p(vk) = p for vk > 0.
R2: Acceleration, vk ← min (vk + 1, vmax) .
R3: Slowing down, vk ← min (vk, dk).
R4: Randomization, vk ← max (vk − 1, 0) with probability p(vk).
R5: Motion, the car is moved forward according to its new velocity, xk ←
xk + vk.
In two-lane traﬃc models, lane changing of vehicles are performed according
to some additional rules [4-7]. In this paper, we shall adopt the symmetric
exchange rules which are deﬁned by the following criteria [5]:

1. min(vk + 1, vmax) > dk

2. dk,other > dk and dk,back > vb

o + 1

3. pch > rand()

Here dk,other (resp. dk,back) denotes the gap on the target lane in front of (resp.
behind) the car that wants to change lanes. vb
o is the velocity of the following
car in the target lane, pch is the lane-changing probability and rand() stands
for a random number between 0 and 1.
The update in the two-lane model is divided into two sub-steps: in one sub-
step, cars may change lanes in parallel following the above lane changing
rules and in the other sub-step each car may move eﬀectively by the forward
movement rules as in the single-lane traﬃc.
We performed computer simulations of the two-lane model with the following
parameters, (p0 = 0.01, p = 0.7 and vmax = 5). The size of the lattice is
given by L = 1000. Starting from an initial conﬁguration (homogenous or
megajam) the system evolved in time steps with respect to the above dynam-
ical rules. For each simulation run, we discarded some number (tdis) of time
steps and we performed averages of the ﬂow over tav = 50000 time steps.
The duration of each run is ”tdis + tav”. The procedure is then repeated for a
number 100 of diﬀerent realizations of the homogenous (or megajam) initial
conﬁgurations. The average over all the diﬀerent realizations gives a mean
value of the ﬂow.
Figure 1 illustrated the variation of the ﬂow J in the two-lane model as a
function of the density of cars and for diﬀerent values of the discarded time
tdis. We noticed ﬁrstly that the ﬂow in both lanes are equal since symmetric

3

lane changing are considered. If the homogenous initial state is used, a higher
branch of the ﬂow is observed for some interval of densities [ρ1, ρ2] whenever
tdis is small enough. When increasing enough tdis, the high branch interval
diminished and disappeared completely at certain limit of tdis. In contrast,
the diagram of the ﬂow corresponding to the megajam initial conﬁguration
is insensitive to the changes of tdis. Hence, the ﬂow diagrams corresponding
to the homogenous and the megajam initial conﬁgurations should collapse if
tdis is large enough. This shows clearly that the hysteresis cannot exist in the
fundamental diagram of the two-lane traﬃc model with slow-to-start rule.
To clarify more the above results, we shall consider the time evolution of
the ﬂow for some ﬁxed density ρ = 0.12 (ρ1 < ρ < ρ2) and for the homoge-
nous and megajam initial states (Fig. 2). It is shown that in contrast to
the single lane VDR model, where the homogenous state is metastable with
an extremely long life-time, this state does not exist in the two-lane version
model. Yet, the ﬂow corresponding to the homogenous initial conﬁguration
decreases with time until reaching the value corresponding to the megajam
initial conﬁguration. The breakdown of the homogeneous structure in the
two lanes is due principally to the lane changing of cars. Figure 3 shows the
evolution of the frequency of lane changing when starting from the initial
homogeneous state in the two-lane VDR model. So, the frequency increases
with time until it reaches a stationary value. In ﬁgure 4, we show the cluster
size distribution in the steady state of the two-lane VDR model for diﬀerent
lane-changing probability pch. The cluster means here a string of successive
stopped cars in a single lane of the two-lane model, i.e. we are considering
only compact jams in a single lane. As the symmetric lane-changing rules are
considered here, the cluster sizes distribution in the two lanes must be equal.
We observe from ﬁgure 4 the bimodal nature of the cluster size distribution
as pch ≃ 1. Large clusters appear in the lanes but there are by far many more
small-sized clusters than large ones. Furthermore, with decreasing pch, the
probability of small clusters increases while that of large clusters diminishes.
If pch = 0, which corresponds to the single lane VDR model, almost all cars
are congested in one large cluster with the exception of a few isolated cars.
This is the well known phase separated state.
In this section, we shall investigate the relaxation dynamics of the two-lane
VDR model for diﬀerent values of pch, when starting from the homogeneous
initial condition. This is done by plotting the time evolutions of the ﬂow and
computing their relaxation times. In ﬁgures 5, we plotted the time evolu-
tions of the ﬂow, when starting from the homogeneous initial conﬁguration,

for several values of pch. We ﬁnd that the equilibration is delayed if pch is
decreased.
To study numerically the relaxation time corresponding to an observable A
we shall use the nonlinear relaxation function [8]:

φ(t) = [A(t) − A(∞)]/[A(0) − A(∞)]

The condition that the system is well equilibrated is

where M0 is the number of Monte Carlo steps that have to be excluded in
the averaging of the observable A. In ﬁgure 6, we plotted the variation of
the relaxation time τ of the observable J near the limit pch → 0. As a result,
the relaxation time is found to diverge as pch → 0. Moreover, we see that
the relaxation time τ follows a power law behavior of the form,

The numerical value of β is given by: β ≈ 0, 9760 ± 0, 0540. Assuming that
the parameter pch is rate of transition for the dynamics of the model, and as it
was demonstrated in Ref. [9], the exponent β is expected to be theoretically
equal to one.
In summary, in contrast to one-lane traﬃc models with slow-to-start rule,
the two-lane version exhibits neither phase separation nor metastability. The
lane changing cars breakdown the organization of the homogenous state as
well as the phase separated states and a new stationary state takes place. In
the NS model, the cluster sizes distribution decreases exponentially while in
the one-lane VDR model, it should depend on the initial state. Yet, for some
density ρ in the hysteresis region of the one-lane VDR model (ρ1 < ρ < ρ2),
no clusters appear in the metastable homogenous state. However, a big
cluster persists in the phase separated state. Nevertheless, in two-lane VDR
model, the stationary state is composed by small and big clusters. The
distribution of these clusters should depend on the lane-changing probability
pch. As pch decreases the relaxation time τ of the system increases and
diverges at the limit pch → 0. The relaxation behaviour follows a power law
behavior of the form, τ ∝ p

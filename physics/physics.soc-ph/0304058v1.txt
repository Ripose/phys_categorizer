Abstract

The compositional scheme of a Bronze Age sword, found near the town of Giurgiu

in Romania has been determined by the method of particle-induced X-ray emission

(PIXE), at the Tandem accelerator of National Institute for Physics and Nuclear

Engineering from Bucharest, Magurele, Romania. The results of the analyses and

the comparison with the composition of other swords from the same geographic

area, the Danubian plane from Bulgaria and Transylvania regions, show that the

sword from Giurgiu could be relatively associated with the swords from Bulgaria,

having also the same stylistic, temporal and geographical similitude.

1 Introduction

The compositional scheme of a Bronze Age sword, Fig. 1, recently discovered near

Giurgiu, a town situated in the south of Romania on the Danube, has been studied

using the method of particle-induced X ray emission (PIXE), at the Tandem accelerator

of National Institute for Physics and Nuclear Engineering from Bucharest, Magurele, Ro-

mania. In order to have a comparative study of composition we have considered also the

composition of 6 swords of the same type and from the same period from the south of

Danube in Bulgaria, and some diﬀerent copper-based alloy objects from S¸p˘alnaca deposit,

in Transylvania, dated also in the Bronze Age.

2 Archaeological considerations

2.1 Site of discovery of the sword

The sword has been discovered by Ion Cercel in 1981 in the Mihai Eminescu street of

the city of Giurgiu, Romania, in the course of diggings related to the installation of

underground electric cables. Since then the sword has been kept by Ion Cercel, who

presently is retired, in his house from the Oinacu commune, district of Giurgiu, in southern

Romania.

In 1999, by a happy concurrence of events, this interesting artifact became

available to us, and we take this opportunity to thank Ion Cercel who has been kind to

render us the sword for study and analyses.

According to the author of the ﬁnding, the artifact has been found at a depth of

approximately 1.1 m, no other bronze objects existing in its vicinity. Foundations of

buildings from the late medieval period were known to exist in the area, but it seems

that no such archaeological remains existed in the speciﬁc place where the sword has

been found. It seems that the site where the sword has been discovered lies outside the

medieval city, buildings being erected there only in the period after 1821.

2.2 Description of the sword

The sword is in a good state of conservation, being preserved almost entirely, and has

the following dimensions: total length 39.5 cm, width at base 5.3 cm, width at the tip

2.9 cm, thickness at base 0.9 cm, thickness toward the tip 0.6 cm, length of the hilt with

missing terminal part 9 cm, length of the blade 30.5 cm. On the blade of the sword one

can observe, on both faces, channels situated at approximately 0.4 cm from the two edges,

as shown in Fig. 1. The blade has a biconvex proﬁle. In the zone of the hilt there are ﬁve

oriﬁces for the rivets of binding of the hilt and also three rivets still left in the oriﬁces.

2

It is possible that in the missing part of the hilt three more oriﬁces should have existed

for the binding of the hilt. The alloy is of a very good quality having a green-dark grey

The sword belongs to the Reutlingen type deﬁned by P. Schauer [1] and described,

with a special view to artifacts attested on Romanian territory, by T. Bader. [2] Choosing

as a criterion of classiﬁcation in the ﬁrst place the number of ﬁxation oriﬁces from the

blade and the hilt, but also the shape of the nervure of the blade, the latter author

distinguished several variants.

[3] Due to the fact that the sword under consideration

presents a large median nervure and which is slightly rounded, we think that it is most

resembling to two fragmentary pieces belonging to the deposit of Drajna de Jos, district

of Prahova, Romania, catalogued by T. Bader with numbers 188 and 189 [4] and included

in the Gu¸sterit¸a variant of the Reutlingen type. Moreover, the Giurgiu sword has much

smaller dimensions, so that it could be rather considered a ”short sword” (Kurzschwert).

patina.

[5]

Artifacts of the Reutlingen type have been discovered over a very large area from the

south of Scandinavia to Peloponesos and from the Rhine basin to the Black Sea, [6] and

recently discoveries have been reported even in Anatolia.

[7] However, the spreading is

not uniform, existing some regions of concentration and others represented by much fewer

discoveries. Among the latter, one counts the extra-Carpathian zone in Romania and the

territory of Bulgaria and Greece. [8]

It is however interesting that, in the Balkan area, the discoveries are concentrated

mainly in the southern part of Romania, Wallachia, and in the north of Bulgaria, some

of them just on the Danube line. In addition to the two pieces from Drajna de Jos, on

the Romanian territory one ﬁnds specimens belonging to some variants in the ensemble

of the Reutlingen type: B˘alce¸sti and Matee¸sti (district of Vˆalcea), Techirghiol (district of

Constant¸a). On the territory of Bulgaria there are 10 discoveries of swords with tongues

at the hilt, of which 7 to the north and 3 to the south of the Balkans. [9] The 7 specimens

discovered on the territory between the Danube and the Balkans arise from Orjahovo

(Orehovo), [10] V˘arbica (deposit II), [11], Bajkal, [12] Kruˇsevo, [13] Balkanski [14] and

Vasil Levski, [15] to which one adds the specimen of smaller dimensions from the Raz-

3

grad Museum (inventory No. 117), discovered in the neighborhood.

[16] Among these

specimens the ﬁrst two belong to the Reutlingen type.

The artifact from Giurgiu has very close analogues (except, of course, for the dimen-

sions) just in the sword from Orjahovo and in the fragmentary artifact from V˘arbica,

both cited as belonging to the Gu¸sterit¸a variant by T. Bader. [17] These two specimens

have been ascribed in the early horizon of the culture of the ﬁelds of urns (von Brunn

stages I-III) [18] by B. H¨ansel, [19] respectively in the subgroup I deﬁned by I. Panayotov
(the second horizon of deposits from Bulgaria: XIIIth century B.C.).

[20] On the other

hand, T. Bader dates, as a function of the synchronisms revealed by the various deposits,

the great majority of the specimens belonging to the Reutlingen type discovered on the
territory of Romania in the Cincu-Suseni period (HaA1, circa XIIth century B.C.), but

ascribes three or four deposits (among which is also the one from Drajna de Jos) for the
slightly earlier period Uriu-Dom˘ane¸sti (Bronze D, circa XIIIth century B.C.) [21] Conse-

quently, taking into account the analogies proposed by us with the specimens from Drajna

de Jos, Orjahovo and V˘arbica II, we favor a dating of the short sword from Giurgiu in the
XIIIth century B.C., probably towards the end of the century; a date around 1200 B.C.

is very likely.

3 Experimental

3 samples from the body of the sword: 1 sample from the tip of the sword and 2 samples

from the hilt have been ﬂatted and irradiated with protons of 3 MeV, in a irradiation

chamber at the FN Tandem accelerator of National Institute for Physics and Nuclear

Engineering from Bucharest, Magurele.

The beam current was kept below 10 nA to maintain a count rate of about 250

counts/s, which implies negligible dead-time and pile-up corrections. X-rays were de-
tected with a HPGe (100 mm2mm) detector with 160 eV energy resolution at 5.9 keV.

The X rays spectra have been recorded on a PC with a MCA interface. In the frame of

the experimental conditions the following elements have been observed: As, Co, Cr, Cu,

Fe, Ni, Pb, Sn and Zn.

4 Results and Discussions

The results of PIXE analysis on the samples from the sword from Giurgiu are shown in

the Table 1. The values of the concentrations are given in %. The instrumental errors are

generally less than 15 %. We made corrections of the elemental concentrations so that

the total value in the sample to be 100 %.

The composition of the 3 samples form the Giurgiu has been compared with the compo-

sition from similar 6 swords from Danubian regions from Bulgaria [22] and some diﬀerent

archaeological objects from the Bronze Age S¸p˘alnaca deposit, Transylvania [23].

We present further, in the Table 2 the results of the analyses published by E. N.

ˇCernyh, for several of the swords with tongue at the hilt from Bulgaria. [22]

6: Vasil Levski (10892), category XI

4: Bajkal (9432, analysis of the hilt; 9433, analysis of the blade), category X

For all specimens included in Table 2, the copper is the dominant element.

In Table 3 are shown the elemental composition for all considered objects: the Giurgiu

sword, the swords from Bulgaria and diﬀerent bronze objects from Transylvanian deposit

at S¸p˘alnaca. Ratios of concentrations are considered for interpretation of the results to

avoid the errors in the absolute calculations of the concentrations. It has been reported

value zero in the cases the value of concentrations has been under the limit of detection.

Fig. 2 presents the diagram of ratios of concentrations: Sn/Cu versus As/Sn for the

analyzed samples in the present study, and also for Bulgarian and Transylvanian objects,

analyzed by atomic spectroscopy and respectively neutron activation analysis.

One could remark that the sword from Giurgiu has a relative closer composition to

the Bulgarian ones, especially for the elements: As, Cu, and Sn. The objects from

Transylvania are situated relatively outside the cluster formed by the objects from Giurgiu

and Bulgaria.

5 Conclusions

We could express the idea of an association of the sword from Giurgiu with the Bulgarian

swords, having a close composition and also similitude in typology, geographic area and

dating. Taking into account the analogies proposed by us with the Bulgarian specimens,

Especially those of Drajna de Jos, Orjahovo and V˘arbica II, we favor a dating of the short
sword from Giurgiu in the XIIIth century B.C., probably towards the end of that century,

around 1200 B.C.

Orjahovo, Kriˇcim and V˘arbica II), p. 182 (”the link between the ﬁrst and the second

subgroup is achieved by the sword from the village of Bajkal”, close to which are the

items from Kruˇsevo, Gradinite-Vasil Levski, Balkanski and the museum of Razgrad),

p. 185 (”in a purely formal respect we diﬀerentiate three subtypes. The ﬁrst one

we mark as Pavelsko type. [...] This subtype is synchronic to the Orjahovo subtype

to which we also relate the fragments from the blade and a trapezum-like plate on

11

the hilt. Here we also include the swords from the village of Balkanski, district of

Razgrad and the one from the village of Kruˇsevo, whose deﬁnition is not absolutely
certain because of bad state of its upper part”). We add that E. N. ˇCernyh, op. cit.,

p. 237, includes in the M-6 group (Nenzingen II), alongside the items from Orjahovo

and V˘arbica, also the sword from Vasil Levski.

Abstract. - In this paper, we study the information propagation in an empirical blogging network
by game-theoretical approach. The blogging network has small-world property and is scale-free.
Individuals in the blogosphere coordinate their decisions according to their idiosyncratic prefer-
ences and the choices of their neighbors. We ﬁnd that corresponding to diﬀerent initial conditions
and weights, the equilibrium frequency of discussions has a transition from high to low as a result
of the common interest in the topics speciﬁed by payoﬀ matrices. Furthermore, under recommen-
dation, namely, individuals in blogging networks refer to additional bloggers’ resources besides
their nearest neighbors preferentially according to the popularity of the blogs, the whole blogging
network ultrafastly evolves into consensus state (absorbing state). Our results reﬂect the dynamic
pattern of information propagation in blogging networks.

Introduction. – Blog, which is short for “web log”,
has gained its ground by online community as a new mech-
anism for communication in recent years [1]. It is often a
personal journal maintained on the Web, which is eas-
ily and frequently updated by the blogger.
In the past
few years, blogs are the fastest growing part of the World
Wide Web (WWW). Advanced social technologies lead
to change of the ways of people’s thinking and commu-
nicating. In the virtual space of blogs, which is usually
referred to as blogosphere, bloggers present their percep-
tion, life experience, ideas, etc, on their blogs, which is
instantly accessible and open to readers around the world
who can comment on the posts of other bloggers. This cre-
ates the eden of free minds and ideas to trigger sparks of
inspiration. Interestingly, the dynamic hierarchy of links
and recommendations generated by blogs creates power-
ful collaborative ﬁltering eﬀect to the tremendous infor-
mation ﬂow travelling through the blogosphere everyday.
Therefore, the blogosphere provides an extraordinary on-
line laboratory to analyze how trends, ideas and informa-
tion travel through social communities. Further investi-
gation into the blogosphere will help understand not only
the dynamic pattern of information propagation in such
ecosystem, but also the collective behavior taking place
on such social networks.

Much previous research investigating the phenomenon
of information propagation on networks has been done
by adopting classic Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR)
model in epidemiology [2–5]. Thinking about a rumor
spreading on social networks: ﬁrst, an ignorant (I) ac-
quires the information from her/his neighbors and be-
comes a spreader (S). Finally, she/he loses interest about
the information and no longer spreads it again, and be-
comes a stiﬂer (R). Accordingly, SIR models information
propagation in which the stiﬂers are never again suscepti-
ble to the information — just like conferring lifetime im-
munity. Yet, SIRS models the situation in which a stiﬂer
eventually becomes susceptible again. For instance, in blo-
gosphere, the SIRS model can be interpreted as follows [6]:
a blogger who has not yet written about a topic is exposed
to the topic by reading the blog of a friend. She/he de-
cides to write about the topic, becoming infected. The
topic may then spread to readers of her/his blog. Later,
she/he may revisit the topic from a diﬀerent perspective
and write about it again. Thus the life cycle of the topics
is analogous to the diseases’.

In the realm of sociology, extensive study of the diﬀu-
sion of innovation in social networks has been conducted
by examining the power of world of mouth in innovations
diﬀusion [6–8]. Generally speaking, there are two funda-
mental models describing the process by which nodes in

p-1

L.-H. Liu et al.

networks adopt new ideas or innovations: threshold mod-
els and cascade models (see ref. [6] and references therein).
In this paper, we empirically investigate the dynamic
pattern of information propagation in blogosphere from
game-theoretical perspective.
Individuals in the blogo-
sphere coordinate their decisions according to their id-
iosyncratic preferences and the choices of their neighbors.
Assume that individuals have two choices, A and B. The
payoﬀ of an individual choosing A or B is composed of two
components: an individual and a social component. The
individual part comes from one’s preference irrespective of
others’ choices in the network while the social component
of payoﬀ results from the mutual (reciprocal) choices of
individual neighbors. As a result of such a coordination
game, one adapts her/his strategy by imitation at each
time step, that is, follows the more successful strategy
measured by the payoﬀ. Analogous to replicator dynam-
ics, after generations and generations, the system arrives
at equilibrium state. The dynamic behaviour of such pro-
cess of information propagation is aﬀected signiﬁcantly by
the blogging network structure. Thus we study the dy-
namics of information propagation empirically on a blog-
ging network which is collected by our WWW robot. The
dynamic pattern of information propagation as a result of
the common interest in the topics speciﬁed by diﬀerent
payoﬀ matrices is also observed.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
Sec. II deals with the blogging network data and explains
the model we adopt to study the information propagation
in blogosphere, and Sec. III gives out the results and makes
some explanations. Conclusions are made in Sec. IV.

The blogging network and the model. – Since
the global blogosphere has more than 20 million blogs,
we focused in our preliminary investigation on its sub-
community — the Chinese blogs hosted by Sina. We
viewed this sub-blogosphere as a close world, i.e., the links
outgoing of the Sina blog community were omitted. We
obtained a directed and connected blogging network con-
sisting of 7520 blogs’ sites which was crawled down by
our WWW robot.
In ﬁg. 1 and ﬁg. 2, we report the
in- and out-degree distributions of the directed blogging
network.
It is found that both in- and out-degree dis-
tributions obey power-law forms where P (kin) ∼ k−γin
with γin = 2.13 ± 0.66, P (kout) ∼ k−γout
with γout =
2.28 ± 0.096. The average degree of our blogging network
hkini = hkouti = 8.42. We noticed that about 18.4% of
the blogs have no outgoing links to other blogs, but the
in-degree of each vertex in the blogging network is at least
one since our blogging network was crawled along the di-
rected links. The fraction of reciprocal edges (symmetric
links) is about 31%. The degree-dependent clustering co-
eﬃcient C(k) is averaged over the clustering coeﬃcient
of all degree k nodes. In ﬁg. 3, we can see that for the
undirected blogging network, it is hard to declare a clear
power law in our case. Nevertheless, the nonﬂat cluster-
ing coeﬃcient distributions shown in the ﬁgure suggests

out

in

that the dependency of C(k) on k is nontrivial, and thus
exhibits some degree of hierarchy in the network. Besides,
the average clustering coeﬃcient of the undirected blog-
ging network is 0.46. The average shortest path length
hli = 4.28. Consequently, our blogging network has small-
world property and is scale-free. A detailed study of the
structure of the blogging network is presented in ref. [9].
Let us introduce the game-theoretical model by which
we study the information propagation on the empirical
blogging network. The social network can be represented
by a directed graph G consisting of a vertex set V and an
edge set E. Each vertex i represents a blogger i (her blogs
represents herself) in the blogosphere. A directed edge
e(i, j) from i to j indicates that j’s actions inﬂuence i’s
actions. Denote Γi as the neighbor set of vertices to which
node i’s outgoing edges connect. At each time step, each
individual has two choices: A and B corresponding to “not
to discuss the topic (No)” and “to write something on the
topic (Yes)” respectively. Let xi represent individual i’s
state (A or B). For convenience, the states are denoted
by the two-dimensional unit vectors,

A =

1
0 (cid:19)

(cid:18)

and B =

0
1 (cid:19)

(cid:18)

(1)

The individual’s choice depends upon the payoﬀ result-
ing from one’s idiosyncratic preference and social inﬂuence
(trend). Therefore, the payoﬀ of an individual choosing A
or B is composed of two components: an individual and a
social component. The individual part fi(xi) of the payoﬀ
results from the intrinsic preference for A or B irrespective
of others. The social component of the payoﬀ is depen-
dent on the externalities created by the choices of one’s
neighbors Γi. The social payoﬀ is supposed to take the
i M xj, where the sum is summed over all i’s
form
outgoing linked neighbors Γi. The payoﬀ matrix M for
the two strategies A and B (the choices A and B can be
interpreted as) is:

j∈Γi xT

P

A B
b
d

A a
B c

(2)

where a > c and d > b. This is a coordination game where
individuals should choose an identical action, whatever it
is, to receive high payoﬀ. Hence matching the partner’s
choice is better oﬀ than not matching (a > c and d >
b). For simplicity, and without loss of the feature of the
coordination game, we set b = c = 0 and d = 1 − a with
0 < a < 1. Thus the rescaled payoﬀ matrix is tuned by a
single parameter a. The payoﬀ Pi of individual i is:

Pi = (1 − w)fi(xi) + w

update rule is in essential “following the crowd” in which
the individuals are inﬂuenced by their neighbors and learn
from local payoﬀ information of their nearest neighbors.
Within this imitation circumstance, the individual tends
to keep up with the social trend based upon the payoﬀ
information gathered from local neighbors.

Results and discussions. – We consider the infor-
mation propagation on the blogging network when some
bloggers are initially selected at random as seeds for dis-
cussing some certain speciﬁed topic in their blogs. All
the bloggers are assumed to be identical in their interests
and preferences, thus the individual part of payoﬀ func-
tion fi(xi) is identical for all i. For simplicity, we set
f (A) = 0.4 and f (B) = 0.5 in our simulations (the same
magnitude as 0 < a < 1). In this situation, bloggers pref-
erentially discuss the topic in their blogs, hence we can
examine the world-of-mouth eﬀect in blogosphere empir-
ically. In addition, all individuals are inﬂuenced by their
outgoing linked neighbors. Individual i’s social payoﬀ is
summed over her/his all outgoing edges in which she/he
compares her/his choice with her/his friends’ and obtains
payoﬀ according to the payoﬀ matrix of eq. (2). The syn-
chronous updating rule is adapted here. At each time step,
each blogger updates her/his decision whether to discuss
or not according to eq. (4). All bloggers in the blogosphere
are assumed to coordinate their choices to their friends
(whose blogs the outgoing links are connected to), because
conformity with friends in choices leads to the solid basis
to communicate and enjoy the fun of the topics. Equilib-
rium frequencies of discussions were obtained by average

over 100 generations after a transient time of 5000 gener-
ations. The evolution of the frequency of discussions as a
function of a and w has been computed corresponding to
diﬀerent initial conditions. Furthermore, each data point
results from averaging over 10 runs for the same parame-
ters.

We present the results of equilibrium frequency of dis-
cussions as a function of the parameter space (a, w) corre-
sponding to diﬀerent initial conditions in ﬁg. 4. The den-
sity of discussions is indicated by the color bar. It is found
that the initial fraction of discussers aﬀects the equilibrium
results quantitatively. In ﬁg. 4, for a), b), c) panels respec-
tively, there is a clear transition from high to low for ﬁxed
w when a is increased from 0 to 1. As aforementioned, the
payoﬀ matrix element a indicates the common interest in
the topic travelling in the blogosphere, that is, when a is
near zero, bloggers in the blogosphere show high interest
in the topic and would like to write something about the
topic; while a is near one, it means that people lose in-
terest in the topic, and reluctant to discuss. Besides, the
weight w also plays a role in equilibrium results. When
w approaches to zero, namely, individuals neglect the so-
cial inﬂuence and only depend upon individual preference
to discuss or not. While w tends to one, individuals are
completely inﬂuenced by their friends regardless of their
own idiosyncratic preferences. Otherwise, for intermedi-
ate w, i.e., the choices are balanced between their individ-
ual preference and social inﬂuence, the “self-organized”
bloggers perform in a collective way that without a center
control most of the individuals in the blogosphere change
conformably from frequently discussing the topic to losing
interest in the topic as a increases from zero to one. More-
over, the critical value ac of a at which the frequency of
discussions transits from high to low is aﬀected by the ini-
tial fraction of discussers. It is observed that for interme-

diate weight w, the critical values of ac are around 0.1, 0.3,
and 0.5 corresponding to the initial fractions of discussers
1%, 21%, and 51% respectively. Thus although the initial
condition inﬂuences the equilibrium result, diﬀerent initial
conditions do not change the equilibrium results qualita-
tively. In other words, for ﬁxed weight w and certain initial
condition, the density of discussions has a clear transition
from high to low when a increases from 0 to 1. We show
the frequency of discussions fd vs a for w = 0.66 and 21%
of initial discussions in ﬁg. 5. The frequency of discussions
decreases from around 84% to 4% with increasing a. The
transition happens around ac = 0.3. Interestingly, we ﬁnd
that there are about 18.4% bloggers have no outgoing links
at all. Hence, their states keep invariant because their de-
cisions are not aﬀected by neighbors. Accordingly, the
whole blogosphere can never evolve into absorbing states
in which all individuals make the same choice A or B. The
typical evolution of frequency of discussions with respect
to time corresponding to diﬀerent a with w = 0.66, initial
condition 21% is shown in ﬁg. 6. With a = 0.11, the bl-
ogosphere quickly evolves into the truncated equilibrium
state where the frequency of discussion often drops down
and recovers to previous level after a while. Near the crit-
ical value of ac with a = 0.31, the frequency of discussions
is decreased at ﬁrst. Yet, it strives to achieve the high
level very soon and is retained small ﬂuctuations around
the equilibrium state. When a is increased to 0.41, the
frequency of discussions descends quickly, and then oscil-
lates around the equilibrium state. With a = 0.81, the
frequency of discussions ﬂuctuates with some “spikes”—
occasionally, it suddenly erupted from 4% to 8%. There-
fore, these results shown in ﬁg. 6 can to some extent reﬂect
the dynamic pattern of information propagation in the real
blogosphere. When most bloggers show great enthusiasm
in the topic (when a is near zero), they extensively dis-
cuss the topic in their blogs. For example, the fraction of
the bloggers talking about “Microsoft” in computer com-

munity is sustained at high value, even though there are
often small ﬂuctuations around the equilibrium state. And
yet, when all individuals have low interest in discussing the
topic (when a is near one), they are reluctant to mention it
in their blogs. For instance, the discussion of “inﬂuenza”,
is rare at non-inﬂuenza season, but bursts out in inﬂuenza
season. Consequently, being consistent with the dynamic
pattern of information propagation in real world, our re-
sults demonstrate that the frequency of discussions has a
transition from high to low due to the common interest
speciﬁed by the payoﬀ matrix for diﬀerent weights w and
initial conditions.

In order to investigate the role of recommendation to in-
formation propagation in blogosphere, we consider a mod-
iﬁed model based upon the above one. In blogging com-
munity, the system often recommends some recent posts
on its main page. Thus the recommended posts are the in-
formation resources which are noticeable for the bloggers
to acquire. In addition, when bloggers surf in the blogo-
sphere, the probability a blog being visited is proportional
to its in-degree. Therefore, for simplicity, we assume that
besides the neighbors to which the blog outgoing links con-
nect, each blogger refers to additional K blogs which are
chosen with probability proportional to their in-degrees,
i.e., the probability pij that individual i chooses j’s blog
(j * Γi) as information reference is,

pij = kin
j /

kin
l

(5)

Since each blogger independently chooses K blogs accord-
ing to the probability proportional to in-degree, the cho-
sen K blogs of each blogger might be diﬀerent. All the
individuals are inﬂuenced by both their neighbors and the
additional K blogs. Let Ai denote the K blogs individual
i chooses. The payoﬀ Pi of individual i becomes,

Pi = (1 − w)fi(xi) + w

The corresponding results are shown in ﬁgs. 7, 8. Fig. 7
shows the evolution of frequency of discussions with K =
10, w = 0.51 and initial condition 21%. With a = 0.11,
the whole blogosphere ultrafastly evolves into absorbing
state where all bloggers discuss the topic in their blogs
(see ﬁg. 7(a)). While for a = 0.81, all individuals choose
not to mention the topic at all (see ﬁg. 7(b)). By contrast,
without the recommendation, the whole blogosphere can
never evolve into collective consensus (see ﬁgs. 4, 5, 6 for
comparison). In ﬁg. 8, we can see that the frequency of
discussions transits from one to zero as a increases from 0
to 1. As a result, under recommendation, the blogosphere
quickly attains the consensus state in which all bloggers
make the same choices A or B. Herein, the selected (rec-
ommended) blogs act as leaders inﬂuencing other bloggers.
Dependent upon the local information Γi and global infor-
mation Ai, individuals ﬁnally achieve conformity of their
choices. Therefore, our result may shed light on under-
standing the collective behaviour in the blogosphere.

Conclusion remarks. – To sum up, we have inves-
tigated information propagation on an empirical social
network, the blogging network, by game-theoretical ap-
proach. The blogging network is a good representative of
real social networks which have small-world property and
are scale-free. We found that for diﬀerent weight w and
initial conditions, the frequency of discussions has a tran-
sition from high to low resulting from the common interest
speciﬁed by the payoﬀ matrix. To some extent, our results
reﬂect the dynamic pattern of information propagation in

blogosphere. Moreover, under the circumstance of rec-
ommendation, the recommended blogs based on their in-
degrees act as leaders inﬂuencing other bloggers. Hence,
the whole blogosphere evolves into absorbing states where
all bloggers achieve the consensus of choices. Based upon
local information Γi and limited global information Ai, in-
dividual i ﬁnally collectively synchronizes her choice with
others. Therefore, our results may help understand the
collective behaviours of bloggers in the blogosphere.

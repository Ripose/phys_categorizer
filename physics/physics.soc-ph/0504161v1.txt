Summary. In this paper we present detailed simulation results on the wealth dis-
tribution model with quenched saving propensities. Unlike other wealth distribution
models where the saving propensities are either zero or constant, this model is not
found to be ergodic and self-averaging. The distribution statistics with a single real-
ization of quenched disorder is found to be much diﬀerent in nature from that of the
statistics averaged over a large number of conﬁgurations. The peculiarities in the
single realization statistics refuses to vanish irrespective of whatever large sample
size is used. This implies that previously observed Pareto law is actually convolution
of single member distributions.

In a society diﬀerent members possess diﬀerent amounts of wealth. Indi-
vidual members often make economic transactions with other members of the
society. Therefore in general the wealth of a member ﬂuctuates with time and
this is true for all other members in the society as well. Over a reasonably
lengthy time interval of observation, which is small compared to the inherent
time scales of the economic society this situation may be looked upon as a
stationary state which implies that statistical properties like the individual
wealth distribution, mean wealth, its ﬂuctuation etc. are independent of time.
More than a century before, Pareto observed that the individual wealth
(m) distribution in a society is characterized by a power-law tail like: P (m) ∼
m−(1+ν) and predicted a value for the constant ν ≈ 1, known as the Pareto
exponent [1]. Very recently, i.e., over the last few years, the wealth distribution
in a society has attracted renewed interests in the context of the study of
Econophysics and various models have been proposed and studied. A number
of analyses have also been done on the real-world wealth distribution data in
diﬀerent countries [2, 3]. All these recent data indeed show that Pareto like
power-law tails do exist in the wealth distributions in the large wealth regime
but with diﬀerent values of the Pareto exponent ranging from ν = 1 to 3.
It has also been observed that only a small fraction of very rich members

in (a) for the DY model and in (b) for the CC model for λ = 0.35. Each ﬁgure has
two plots. For N = 256, the thick (line width = 3) black line curve is averaged over
ten initial conﬁgurations where as the thin (line width = 1) white line curve is for
one initial conﬁguration. The excellent overlapping of the two curves show that both
the DY and CC models are self averaging.

actually contribute to the Pareto behavior whereas middle and low wealth
individuals follow either exponential or log-normal distributions.

In this paper we report our detailed simulation results on three recent
models of wealth distribution. We present detailed numerical results exhibiting
some inherent structures present in these models. The three models are: (i) the
model of Dr˘agulescu and Yakovenko (DY) [4] which gives an exponential decay
of the wealth distribution, (ii) the model of Chakraborti and Chakrabarti (CC)
[7] with a ﬁxed saving propensity giving a Gamma function for the wealth
distribution and (iii) the model of Chatterjee, Chakrabarti and Manna (CCM)
[8] with a distribution of quenched individual saving propensities giving a
Pareto law for the wealth distribution.

All these three models have some common features. The society consists of
a group of N individuals, each has a wealth mi(t), i = 1, N . The wealth distri-
bution {mi(t)} dynamically evolves with time following the pairwise conser-
vative money shuﬄing method of economic transactions. Randomly selected
pairs of individuals make economic transactions one after another in a time
sequence and thus the wealth distribution changes with time. For example,
let two randomly selected individuals i and j, (i 6= j) have wealths mi and
mj. They make transactions by a random bi-partitioning of their total wealth
mi + mj and then receiving one part each randomly.

mi(t + 1) = ǫ(t)(mi(t) + mj(t))
mj(t + 1) = (1 − ǫ(t))(mi(t) + mj(t)).

Fig. 2. For the CC model with N = 256 and λ = 0.35 these plots show the functional
ﬁts of the wealth distribution in (a) and the variation of the most probable wealth
mp(λ) in (b). In (a) the simulation data of Prob(m) is shown by the solid black line
where as the ﬁtted Gamma function of Eqn. (5) is shown by the dashed line. In (b)
the mp(λ) data for 24 diﬀerent λ values denoted by circles is ﬁtted to the Gamma
function given in Eqn. (6) (solid line). The thin line is a comparison with the mp(λ)
values obtained from the analytical expression of a(λ) and b(λ) in [9].

Here time t is simply the number of transactions and ǫ(t) is the t-th random
fraction with uniform distribution drawn for the t-th transaction.

In all three models the system dynamically evolves to a stationary state
which is characterized by a time independent probability distribution Prob(m)
of wealths irrespective of the details of the initial distribution of wealths to
start with. Typically in all our simulations a ﬁxed amount of wealth is assigned
to all members of the society, i.e. Prob(m, t = 0) = δ(m − hmi). The model
described so far is precisely the DY model in [4]. The stationary state wealth
distribution for this model is [4, 5, 6]:

Prob(m) = exp(−m/hmi).

(2)

Typically hmi is chosen to be unity without any loss of generality.

A ﬁxed saving propensity is introduced in the CC model [7]. During the
economic transaction each member saves a constant λ fraction of his wealth.
The total sum of the remaining wealths of both the traders is then randomly
partitioned and obtained by the individual members randomly as follows:

mi(t + 1) = λmi(t) + ǫ(t)(1 − λ)(mi(t) + mj(t))
mj(t + 1) = λmj (t) + (1 − ǫ(t))(1 − λ)(mi(t) + mj(t)).

(3)

The stationary state wealth distribution is an asymmetric distribution with a
single peak. The distribution vanishes at m = 0 as well as for large m values.

Fig. 3. The wealth distribution Prob(m) in the stationary state for the CCM
model for a single initial conﬁguration of saving propensities {λi} with N =256 is
shown by the solid line. Also the wealth distributions of the individual members
with seven diﬀerent tagged values of λtag are also plotted on the same curve with
dashed lines. This shows that the averaged (over all members) distribution Prob(m)
is the convolution of wealth distributions of all individual members.

The most probable wealth mp(λ) increases monotonically with λ and the
distribution tends to the delta function again in the limit of λ → 1 irrespective
of the initial distribution of wealth.

In the third CCM model diﬀerent members have their own ﬁxed individ-
ual saving propensities and therefore the set of {λi, i = 1, N } is a quenched
variable. Economic transactions therefore take place following these equations:

mi(t + 1) = λimi(t) + ǫ(t)[(1 − λi)mi(t) + (1 − λj )mj(t)]
mj(t + 1) = λj mj(t) + (1 − ǫ(t))[(1 − λi)mi(t) + (1 − λj)mj (t)]

(4)

where λi and λj are the saving propensities of the members i and j. The
stationary state wealth distribution shows a power law decay with a value of
the Pareto exponent ν ≈ 1 [8].

In this paper we show that while the ﬁrst two models are ergodic and
therefore self-averaging, the third model is not. This makes the third model
diﬃcult to study numerically.

We simulated DY model with N = 256, 512 and 1024. Starting from an
initial equal wealth distribution Prob(m) = δ(m − 1) we skipped some trans-
actions corresponding to a relaxation time t× to reach the stationary state.
Typically t× ∝ N . In the stationary state we calculated the three probabil-

ity distributions: (i) the wealth distribution Prob1(m) of a particular tagged
member (ii) the overall wealth distribution Prob2(m) (averaged over all mem-
bers of the society) on a long single run (single initial conﬁguration, single se-
quence of random numbers) and (iii) the overall wealth distribution Prob(m)
averaged over many initial conﬁgurations. In Fig. 1(a) we show these plots for
N = 512 and observe that these two plots overlap very nicely, i.e., these two
distributions are same. This implies that the DY model is ergodic as well as
self-averaging.

Similar calculations are done for the CC model as well (Fig. 1(b)). We see a
similar collapse of the data for all two probability distributions. This lead us to
conclude again that the CC model is ergodic and self-averaging. Moreover we
ﬁt in Fig. 2(a) the CC model distribution Prob(m) using a Gamma function
as cited in [9] as:

Prob(m) ∼ ma(λ) exp(−b(λ)m)

(5)

which gives excellent non-linear ﬁts by xmgrace to all values of λ in the range
between say 0.1 to 0.9. Once ﬁtting is done the most-probable wealth is esti-
mated by the relation: mp(λ) = a(λ)/b(λ) using the values of ﬁtted parameters
a(λ) and b(λ). Functional dependences of a and b on λ are also predicted in
[9]. We plot mp(λ) so obtained with λ for 24 diﬀerent values of λ in Fig. 2(b).
We observe that these data points ﬁt very well to another Gamma distribution
as:

mp(λ) = Aλα exp(−βλ).

(a) The mean wealth of a tagged member who has the maximal saving
propensity is plotted as a function of time for four diﬀerent values of λmax. In (b)
this data is scaled to obtain the data collapse.

The values of A ≈ 1.46, α ≈ 0.703 and β ≈ 0.377 are estimated for N = 256,
512 and 1024 and we observe a concurrence of these values up to three decimal
places for the three diﬀerent system sizes. While mp(0) = 0 from Eqn. (6) is
consistent, mp(1) = 1 implies A = exp(β) is also consistent with estimated
values of A and β. Following [9] we plotted mp(λ) = 3λ/(1 + 2λ) in Fig. 2(b)
for the same values of λ and observe that these values deviate from our points
for the small λ values.

However, for the CCM model many inherent structures are observed. We
argue that this model is neither self-averaging nor ergodic. For a society of
N = 256 members a set of quenched individual saving propensities {0 ≤ λi <
1, i = 1, N } are assigned drawing these numbers from an independent and
identical distribution of random numbers. The system then starts evolving
with random pairwise conservative exchange rules cited in Eqn. (4). First
we reproduced the Prob(m) vs. m curve given in [8] by averaging the wealth
distribution over 500 uncorrelated initial conﬁgurations. The data looked very
similar to that given in [8] and the Pareto exponent ν is found very close to
1.

Next we plot the same data for a single initial quenched conﬁguration of
saving propensities as shown in Fig. 3. It is observed that the wealth distri-
bution plotted by the continuous solid line is far from being a nice power law
as shown in [8] for the conﬁguration averaged distribution. This curve in Fig.
3 has many humps, especially in the large wealth limit. To explain this we
made further simulations by keeping track of the wealth distributions of the
individual members. We see that the individual wealth distributions are much
diﬀerent from being power laws, they have single peaks as shown in Fig. 4. For
small values of λ, the Prob1(m) distribution is asymmetric and has the form

Fig. 6.
In the stationary state the mean value of the wealth of the member with
maximum saving propensity λmax is plotted with λmax. This value diverges as
λmax → 1 for N = 64 (circle), 128 (square), 256 (triangle up), 512 (diamond)
and 1024 (triangle down). (b) This data is scaled to obtain a data collapse of the

of a Gamma function similar to what is already observed for the CC model
(Fig. 4(a)). On the other hand as λ → 1 the variation becomes more and more
symmetric which ﬁnally attains a simple Gaussian function (Fig. 4(b)). The
reason is for small λ the individual wealth distribution does feel the presence
of the inﬁnite wall at m = 0 since no debt is allowed in this model, where as
for λ → 1 no such wall is present and the distribution becomes symmetric.
This implies that the wealth possessed by an individual varies within a limited
region around an average value and certainly the corresponding phase trajec-
tory does not explore the whole phase space. This implies that the model is
not ergodic.

Seven individual wealth distributions have been plotted in Fig. 3. corre-
sponding to six top most λ values and one with somewhat smaller value. We
see that top parts of these Prob1(m) distributions almost overlap with the
Prob2(m) distribution. This shows that Prob2(m) distribution is truly a su-
perposition of all Prob1(m) distributions. In the limit of λ → 1, large gaps
are observed in the Prob2(m) distribution due to slight diﬀerences in the λ
values of the corresponding individuals. These gaps remain there no matter
whatever large sample size is used for the Prob2(m) distribution.

We argue that even the conﬁguration averaging may be diﬃcult for very
slow relaxation modes present in the system. To show this we consider the
CCM model where the maximal saving propensity λmax is continuously tuned.
The N -th member is assigned λmax and all other members are assigned values
{0 ≤ λi < λmax, i = 1, N − 1}. The average wealth hm(λmax)i/N of the N -th
member is estimated at diﬀerent times for N = 256 and they are plotted in

8

Fig. 5(a) for four diﬀerent values of λmax. It is seen that as λmax → 1 its
mean wealth increases very fast and also it takes increasingly longer times to
reach the stationary state. In Fig. 5(b) we made a scaling of these plots like

[hm(λmax)i/N ](1 − λmax)0.725 ∼ G[t(1 − λmax)].

This implies that the stationary state of the member with maximal saving
propensity is reached after a relaxation time t× given by

t× ∝ (1 − λmax)−1.

(7)

(8)

Therefore we conclude that the maximal λ member reaches the stationary
state at the slowest rate where as rest of the members reach their stationary
states earlier.

This observation poses a diﬃculty in the simulation of the CCM model.
Since this is a problem of quenched disorder it is necessary that the observables
should be averaged over many diﬀerent realizations of uncorrelated disorders.
Starting from an arbitrary initial distribution of mi values one generally skips
the relaxation time t× and then collect the data. In the CCM model the
0 ≤ λi < 1 is used. Therefore if M diﬀerent quenched disorders are used for
averaging it means the maximal of all M × N λ values is around 1 − 1/(M N ).
This implies that the slowest relaxation time grows proportional to M N .
The main message is more accurate simulation one wants to do by increasing
the number of quenched conﬁgurations, more time it has to spend for each
quenched conﬁguration to ensure that it had really reached the stationary
state.

Next, we calculate the variation of the mean wealth hm(λmax)i/N of the
maximally tagged member in the stationary state as a function of λmax and
for the diﬀerent values of N . In Fig. 6(a) we plot this variation for N = 64,
128, 256, 512 and 1024 with diﬀerent symbols. It is observed that larger the
value of N the hm(λmax)i/N is closer to zero for all values of λmax except for
those which are very close to 1. For λmax → 1 the mean wealth increases very
sharply to achieve the condensation limit of hm(λmax = 1)i/N = 1.

It is also observed that the divergence of the mean wealth near λmax = 1 is
associated with a critical exponent. In Fig. 6(b) we plot the same mean wealth
with the deviation (1−λmax) from 1 on a double logarithmic scale and observe
power law variations. A scaling of these plots is done corresponding to a data
collapse like:

[hm(λmax)i/N ]N

−0.15 ∼ F[(1 − λmax)N 1.5].

(9)

Diﬀerent symbols representing the data for the same ﬁve system sizes fall
on the same curve which has a slope around 0.76. The scaling function
F [x] → x−δ as x → 0 with δ ≈ 0.76. This means hm(λmax)iN −0.85 ∼
(1 − λmax)−0.76N −1.14 or hm(λmax)i ∼ (1 − λmax)−0.76N −0.29. Since for a
society of N traders (1 − λmax) ∼ 1/N this implies

hm(λmax)i ∼ N 0.47.

(10)

This result is therefore diﬀerent from the claim that hm(λmax)i ∼ N [8].

To summarize, we have revisited the three recent models of wealth distri-
bution in Econophysics. Detailed numerical analysis yields that while the DY
and CC models are ergodic and self-averaging, the CCM model with quenched
saving propensities does not seem to be so. In CCM existence of slow modes
proportional to the sample size makes the numerical analysis diﬃcult.

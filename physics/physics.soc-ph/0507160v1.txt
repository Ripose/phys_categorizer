Abstract

In this paper the dependence of wealth distribution and the velocity of money on
the required reserve ratio is examined based on a random transfer model of money
and computer simulations. A fractional reserve banking system is introduced to
the model where money creation can be achieved by bank loans and the monetary
aggregate is determined by the monetary base and the required reserve ratio. It is
shown that monetary wealth follows asymmetric Laplace distribution and latency
time of money follows exponential distribution. The expression of monetary wealth
distribution and that of the velocity of money in terms of the required reserve ratio
are presented in a good agreement with simulation results.

1 Introduction

Recently two essential aspects of money circulation have been investigated
based on the random transfer models [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]. One is statistical distri-
bution of money, which is closely related to earlier Pareto income distribution
[9] and some recent empirical observations [10,11,12,13,14]. The other one is
the velocity of money, which measures the ratio of transaction volume to the

money stock in an economic system. All the models which appeared in these
researches regarded the monetary system as being composed of agents and
money, and money could be transferred randomly among agents. In such a
random transferring process, money is always being held by agents, any single
agent’s amount of money may strongly ﬂuctuate over time, but the overall
equilibrium probability distribution can be observed under some conditions.
The shape of money distribution in each model is determined by its transfer-
ring rule, for instance, random exchange can lead to a Boltzmann-Gibbs distri-
bution [3], transferring with uniform saving factor can lead to a Gaussian-like
distribution [4] and that with diverse saving factors leads to a Pareto distri-
bution [5]. On the other hand, the time interval between two transfers named
as holding time of money is also a random variable with a steady probability
distribution in the random transferring process. The velocity of money could
be expressed as the expectation of the reciprocal of holding time and the prob-
ability distribution over holding time was found to follow exponential or power
laws [7,8].

The amount of money held by agents was limited to be non-negative in the
models mentioned above except Ref. [3]. Allowing agents to go into debt and
putting a limit on the maximal debt of an agent, Adrian Dr˘agulescu and Vic-
tor Yakovenko demonstrated the equilibrium probability distribution of money
still follows the Boltzmann-Gibbs law. Although they devote only one section
to discussing the role of debt in the formation of the distribution, they are
undoubtedly pathﬁnders on this aspect. As cited in their paper, “debts create
money” [15]. Speciﬁcally, most part of the money stock is created by debts
through banking system, and this process of money creation plays a signiﬁcant
role in performance of economy especially by aﬀecting the aggregate output
[16]. Thus money creation should not be excluded from discussion on the is-
sues of monetary economic system. With cognition of this signiﬁcance, Robert
Fischer and Dieter Braun analyzed the process of creation and annihilation
of money from a mechanical perspective by proposing analogies between as-
sets and the positive momentum of particles and between liabilities and the
negative one [17,18]. They further applied this approach into the study on
statistical mechanics of money [19].

As well known, the central bank plays an important role of controlling the
monetary aggregate that circulates in the modern economy. It issues the mon-
etary base which is much less than the monetary aggregate. The ratio of the
monetary aggregate to the monetary base is called the money multiplier. The
central bank controls the monetary aggregate mainly by adjusting the mone-
tary base and by setting the required reserve ratio which is a key determinant
of the multiplier. So the required reserve ratio is crucial in monetary economic
system. The aim of this work is to investigate the impacts of the required
reserve ratio on monetary wealth distribution and the velocity of money. Our
model is an extended version of that of Robert Fischer and Dieter Braun [19].

2

In their model, random transfer would increase the quantity of money with-
out bounds unless some limits are imposed exogenously on the stock of assets
and liabilities, which are given by specifying an aggregate limit or imposing a
transfer potential. Compared with this, we introduce the monetary base and
the required reserve ratio in our model by interpreting the process of money
creation with the simpliﬁed money multiplier model. Thus the limit can be
governed by setting the initial values of the monetary base and the required
reserve ratio. In addition, we adopt the conventional economic deﬁnition of
money instead of what they used. We think that the conventional deﬁnition
of money is more appropriate to the analysis of realistic monetary system. We
hope that our work can expose the role of the required reserve ratio in mone-
tary circulation and is helpful to understand the eﬀect of the central bank on
monetary economic system.

This paper is organized as follows. In next section we make a brief presentation
of money creation and the simpliﬁed multiplier model. In Section 3 we propose
a random transfer model of money with a bank. And the shapes of monetary
wealth distribution and latency time distribution are demonstrated. In Section
4 the dependence of monetary wealth distribution and the velocity of money
on the required reserve ratio is presented quantitatively. We ﬁnish with some
conclusions in Section 5.

2 Money Creation and Simpliﬁed Multiplier Model

Modern banking system is a fractional reserve banking system, which ab-
sorbs savers’ deposits and loans to borrowers. Generally the public holds both
currency and deposits. As purchasing, the public can pay in currency or in de-
posits. In this sense, currency held by the public and deposits in bank can both
play the role of exchange medium. Thus the monetary aggregate is measured
by the sum of currency held by the public and deposits in bank in economics.
When the public saves a part of their currency into commercial banks, this
part of currency turns into deposits and the monetary aggregate does not
change. Once commercial banks loan to borrowers, usually in deposit form,
deposits in bank increase and currency held by the public keeps constant. So
loaning behavior of commercial banks increases the monetary aggregate and
achieves money creation.

Money creation of commercial banks is partly determined by the required re-
serve ratio. In reality, commercial banks always hold some currency as reserves
in order to repay savers on demand. Total reserves are made up of ones that
the central bank compels commercial banks to hold, called required reserves,
and extra ones that commercial banks elect to hold, called excess reserves. In-
stead of appointing required reserves for each of commercial banks, the central

3

bank speciﬁes a percentage of deposits that commercial banks must hold as
reserves, which is known as the required reserve ratio. The role of the required
reserve ratio in money creation is illuminated well by the multiplier model
[20].

The multiplier model, originally developed by Brunner and Meltzer [21,22],
has become the standard paradigm in the textbooks of macroeconomics. We
introduce its simpliﬁed version here. In monetary economic system, the mon-
etary aggregate can be measured by

M = C + D,

M0 = C + R.

R = RR + ER.

RR = rD.

where C denotes currency held by the public and D denotes total deposits.
The monetary base M0 is the sum of currency held by the public and reserves
in the banking system, R:

Reserves, which are decomposed into required reserves RR and excess reserves
ER, can be given by

Required reserves can be calculated according to the required reserve ratio r
and deposits in commercial banks D:

So Equation (3) can be rewritten as

R = ER + rD.

For simplicity, assume that the public holds no currency in hand and that
excess reserves are always zero. With these two assumptions, combining Equa-
tions (1), (2) and (5) produces the monetary base-multiplier representation of
the monetary aggregate:

where m, the money multiplier, is given by

M = mM0,

m =

1
r

.

4

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

(5)

(6)

(7)

According to this representation, an increment of one dollar in the monetary
base produces an increment of 1/r dollars in the monetary aggregate. Since
loans made by commercial banks create equal amount of money, its volume
L is the diﬀerence between the monetary aggregate and the monetary base,
that is

L =

M0
r −

M0.

(8)

This equation shows clearly the relation between money creation and the
required reserve ratio. As the required reserve ratio increases, the capability
of money creation declines. Please note if the public holds currency in hand or
commercial banks decide to keep some amount of currency as excess reserves,
the amount of money L created by the banking system is less than the value
given by the right-hand side of Equation (8).

Although all factors involved in money creation except the required reserve
ratio are ignored in the simpliﬁed multiplier model, it conveys us the essence of
money creation in reality. This suggests that the role of money creation can be
investigated by focusing on the impacts of the required reserve ratio on relevant
issues. Thus we simply introduced a bank into the random transfer model to
examine how the required reserve ratio aﬀects monetary wealth distribution
and the velocity of money.

3 Model and Simulation

Our model is an extension of the model in Ref. [19]. The economy turns into
the one consisting of N traders and a virtual bank. We postulate that all
traders hold money only in deposit form throughout the simulations. At the
beginning, a constant monetary base M0 is equally allocated to N traders and
is all saved in the bank. As a result, total reserves held by the bank are M0
at the beginning. Time is discrete. Each of the traders chooses his partner
randomly in each round, and yield N trade pairs. In each trade pair, one
is chosen as “payer” randomly and the other as “receiver”. If the payer has
deposits in the bank, he pays one unit of money to the receiver in deposit form.
If the payer has no deposit and the bank has excess reserves, the payer borrows
one unit of money from the bank and pays it to the receiver in deposit form.
But if the bank has no excess reserve, the trade is cancelled. After receiving
one unit of money, if the receiver has loans, he repays his loans. Otherwise the
receiver holds this unit of money in deposit form.

Simulations are expected to show the results of two issues. One is monetary
wealth distributions. Monetary wealth is deﬁned as the diﬀerence between

5

deposit volume and loan volume of a trader. Thus the data of deposit and
loan volumes of each trader need to be collected. The other is the velocity
of money. When the transferring process of currency is a Poisson process,
the velocity of money can be calculated by latency time, which is deﬁned
as the time interval between the sampling moment and the moment when
money takes part in trade after the sampling moment for the ﬁrst time. The
distribution of latency time in this case takes the following form

(9)

(10)

P (t) =

e− t
T ,

V =

.

where 1/T is the intensity of the Poisson process. It can be obtained by simple
manipulation that the velocity of money is the same as the intensity [7]. Thus
we have,

As collecting latency time, each transfer of the deposits can be regarded as
that of currency chosen randomly from reserves in the bank equivalently.

105 and N = 2.5

Since the initial settings of the amount of money and the number of traders
have no impacts on the ﬁnal results, we performed several simulations with
104, while altering the required reserve ratio. It
M0 = 2.5
is found that given a required reserve ratio the monetary aggregate increases
approximately linearly for a period, and after that it approaches and remains
at a steady value, as shown in Figure 1. We ﬁrst recorded the steady values of
the monetary aggregate for diﬀerent required reserve ratios and the results are
shown in Figure 2. This relation is in a good agreement with that drawn from
the simpliﬁed multiplier model. We also plotted the values of time when the
monetary aggregate begins to be steady for diﬀerent required reserve ratios
105 or so, the data
in Figure 3. Since the maximal value among them is 1.2
105
of deposit volume, loan volume and latency time were collected after 8
rounds. We are fully convinced that the whole economic system has reached
a stationary state by that moment.

m− and p+(m)

As shown in Figure 4, monetary wealth is found to follow asymmetric Laplace
distribution which is divided into two exponential parts by Y Axis [23], which
m+ respectively, where m+ is
can be expressed as p−(m)
the average amount of positive monetary wealth and m− is the average amount
of negative monetary wealth. This asymmetry of the distribution arises from
the non-zero monetary base set initially in our model which money creation
can be achieved on the basis of. It is worth mentioning that in Ref. [19] the dis-
tribution with such a shape can also be obtained by imposing an asymmetric,
triangular-shaped transfer potential. From simulation results, it is also seen

that latency time follows an exponential law, as shown in Figure 5. This result
indicates that the transferring process of currency is indeed a Poisson type.

4 Results and Discussion

4.1 Monetary Wealth Distribution Versus the Required Reserve Ratio

We show monetary wealth distributions for diﬀerent required reserve ratios in
Figure 6. It is seen that both m+ and m− decrease as the required reserve ratio
increases. When the required reserve ratio increases closely to 1, m− decreases
closely to 0 and the distribution changes gradually from asymmetric Laplace
distribution to Boltzmann-Gibbs law which is the result from the model of
Adrian Dr˘agulescu and Victor Yakovenko.

The stationary distribution of monetary wealth can be obtained by the method
of the most probable distribution [24]. In our model, if N traders are dis-
tributed over monetary wealth, with nm traders holding monetary wealth
0), nm′ traders holding monetary wealth m′(< 0), this distribution can

ways. It is also required that the total number of traders, the total amount of
positive monetary wealth M+ and that of negative monetary wealth M− must
be kept constant at stationary state, that is

It is seen that both m+ and m− decrease as the required reserve ratio increases,
and the value of m+ is always larger than that of m− at the same required
reserve ratio. These results are illustrated by the solid lines in Figure 7. They
are in good agreement with simulation results denoted by dots.

4.2 The Velocity of Money Versus the Required Reserve Ratio

The formula of the velocity of money will be deduced here. It is known that the
velocity of money is equal to the intensity of the Poisson process from Equation
(10). The intensity of the Poisson process can be measured by average times
a unit of money takes part in trades in each round. This suggests that the
velocity of money is also the value of transaction volume in each round A
divided by the money stock, i.e.,

V =

=

1
T

A
M0

.

In order to obtain the expression of V in terms of the required reserve ratio,
the analysis of A is required at ﬁrst.

For convenience in manipulation, traders are now classiﬁed into two groups:
the traders with positive monetary wealth and the ones with non-positive
monetary wealth, whose numbers are denoted by N+ and N− respectively.
From the trading mode of our model, it can be reckoned out that each trader
participates in trade averagely 2 times in one round. In each transfer of money,
the probability of transferring a unit of money is 1/2 for the traders with
positive monetary wealth, and it must be less than 1/2 for the traders with
non-positive monetary wealth, for borrowing may fail due to the limitation
of required reserves. Let ω denote this probability, from the detailed balance
condition which holds in steady state, we have

ωp−(m1)p+(m2) =

p−(m1

1)p+(m2 + 1).

(25)

Substituting the expressions of monetary wealth distribution (18) into Equa-
tion (25), we obtain

Thus the total trade volume in each round on average can be expressed as

Substituting Equation (27) into (24), the velocity of money can be given by

Figure 8 shows the relationships between the velocity of money and the re-
quired reserve ratio, from simulation results and from Equation (32) respec-
tively. By measuring latency time for diﬀerent required reserve ratios, the cor-
responding velocities of money are obtained from Equation (10). From Figure
8, it is seen that the velocity of money has an inverse relation with the required
reserve ratio. This can be interpreted in this way. In each round, if every pair
of traders could fulﬁll their transfer of money, the trade volume would be N
in our model. However, in each round some transfers are cancelled because
the payers with non-positive monetary wealth may not get loans from the
bank. As indicated by Equation (32), the average realized transfer ratio can
m+ , which decreases as the required reserve ratio
be expressed in the form of e
increases. Thus the trade volume in each round decreases, and as a result the
velocity of money decreases.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, in order to see how money creation aﬀects the statistical me-
chanics of money circulation, we develop a random transfer model of money by
introducing a fractional reserve banking system. In this model, the monetary
aggregate is determined by the monetary base and the required reserve ratio.
Computer simulations show that the steady monetary wealth distribution fol-
lows asymmetric Laplace type and latency time of money obeys exponential
distribution regardless of the required reserve ratio. The distribution function
of monetary wealth in terms of the required reserve ratio is deduced. Likewise,
the expression of the velocity of money is also presented. These theoretical
calculations are in quantitative agreement with the corresponding simulation
results. We believe that this study is helpful for understanding the process of
money creation and its impacts in reality.

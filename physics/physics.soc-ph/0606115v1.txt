Abstract. Earlier we proposed the stochastic point process model, which reproduces
a variety of self-aﬃne time series exhibiting power spectral density S(f ) scaling as
power of the frequency f and derived a stochastic diﬀerential equation with the same
long range memory properties. Here we present a stochastic diﬀerential equation as a
dynamical model of the observed memory in the ﬁnancial time series. The continuous
stochastic process reproduces the statistical properties of the trading activity and serves
as a background model for the modeling waiting time, return and volatility. Empirically
observed statistical properties: exponents of the power-law probability distributions
and power spectral density of the long-range memory ﬁnancial variables are reproduced
with the same values of few model parameters.

1. Introduction

Stochastic volatility models of the ﬁnancial time series are fundamental to investment,
option pricing and risk management [1, 2]. The volatility serves as a quantitative
price diﬀusion measure in widely accepted stochastic multiplicative process known as
geometric Brownian motion (GBM). Extensive empirical data analysis of big price
movements in the ﬁnancial markets conﬁrms the assumption that volatility itself is a
stochastic variable or more generally the function of a stochastic variable [3]. By analogy
with physics we can assume that speculative prices p(t) change in a ”random medium”
described by the random diﬀusion coeﬃcient. Such analogy may be reversible from
the point that the complex models of stochastic price movements can be applicable for
the description of complex physical systems such as stochastic resonance, noise induced
phase transitions and high energy physics applications. This analogy contributes to
further development of statistical mechanics - nonextensive one and superstatistics have
been introduced [4, 5].

Additive-multiplicative stochastic models of the ﬁnancial mean-reverting processes
provide rich spectrum of shapes for the probability distribution function (PDF)
depending on the model parameters [6]. Such stochastic processes model the empirical
PDF’s of volatility, volume and price returns with success when the appropriate
ﬁtting parameters are selected. Nevertheless, there is the necessity to select the most
appropriate stochastic models able to describe volatility as well as other variables under
the dynamical aspects and the long range correlation aspects. There is empirical
evidence that trading activity, trading volume, and volatility are stochastic variables
with the long-range correlation [1, 7, 8] and this key aspect is not accounted for in
widespread models. Moreover, rather often there is evidence that the models proposed
are characterized only by the short-range time memory [9].

Phenomenological descriptions of volatility, known as heteroscedasticity, have
proven to be of extreme importance in the option price modeling [10]. Autoregressive
conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH) processes and more sophisticated structures
GARCH are proposed as linear dependencies on previous values of squared returns
and variances [10, 11]. These models based on empirically ﬁtted parameters fail in
reproducing power law behavior of the volatility autocorrelation function. We do
believe that the stochastic models with the limited number of parameters and minimum
stochastic variables are possible and would better reﬂect the market dynamics and its
response to the external noise.

Recently we investigated analytically and numerically the properties of stochastic
multiplicative point processes [12], derived formula for the power spectrum and related
the model with the general form of multiplicative stochastic diﬀerential equation [13].
Preliminary the comparison of the model with the empirical data of spectrum and
probability distribution of stock market trading activity [14] stimulated us to work
on the deﬁnition of more detailed model. The extensive empirical analysis of the
ﬁnancial market data, supporting the idea that the long-range volatility correlations

Long-range memory model of trading activity and volatility

arise from trading activity, provides valuable background for further development of the
long-ranged memory stochastic models [7, 8]. We will present the stochastic model of
trading activity with the long-range correlation and will investigate its’ connection to
the stochastic modeling of volatility and returns.

2. Stochastic model of interevent time

k

Earlier we proposed the stochastic point process model, which reproduced a variety of
self-aﬃne time series exhibiting the power spectral density S(f ) scaling as power of the
frequency f [12, 14]. The time interval between point events in this model ﬂuctuates as
a stochastic variable described by the multiplicative iteration equation
+ στ µ

τk+1 = τk + γτ 2µ−1
tk between subsequent events k and k +1 ﬂuctuates due

to the random perturbation by a sequence of uncorrelated normally distributed random
with the zero expectation and unit variance, σ denotes the standard
variable
deviation of the white noise and γ
1 is a coeﬃcient of the nonlinear damping. It has
been shown analytically and numerically [12, 14] that the point process with stochastic
interevent time (1) may generate signals with the power-law distributions of the signal
intensity and 1/f β noise. The corresponding Ito stochastic diﬀerential equation for the
variable τ (t) as a function of the actual time can be written as

stochastic variable τ (t) which can be assumed as slowly diﬀusing mean interevent time
of Poisson process with the stochastic rate 1/τ (t). We put the modulated Poisson
process into the background of the long-range memory point process model.

The diﬀusion of τ must be restricted at least from the side of high values. Therefore

3. Stochastic model of ﬂow of points or events

The introduced stochastic multiplicative model of interevent time, the interval between
trades in the ﬁnancial market, deﬁnes the model of event ﬂow n. First of all we apply
Ito transformation of variables introducing ﬂow of events n(t) = 1
τ (t) . The stochastic

Stochastic variable n denotes the number of events per unit time interval. One has
to integrate the stochastic signal Eq. (8) in the time interval τd to get number of events
in the selected time window.
In this paper we will denote the integrated number of
points or events as

and will call it trading activity in the case of the ﬁnancial market. Flow of points
or events arises in diﬀerent ﬁelds, such as physics, economics, cosmology, ecology,
neurology, the Internet, seismology, i.e., electrons, photons, cars, pulses, events, and so
on, or subsequent actions, like seismic events, neural action potentials, transactions in
the ﬁnancial markets, human heart beats, biological ion-channel openings, burst errors
in many communication systems, the Internet network packets, etc. We will discuss
possible application of the proposed stochastic model to model the trading activity in
the ﬁnancial markets.

4. Stochastic model of trading activity

It is widely accepted that in high-frequency ﬁnancial data not only the returns but also
the waiting times between the consecutive trades are random variables [15]. Waiting
times between trades do not follow the exponential distribution and the related point
process is not the Poisson one. The extensive empirical analysis provides evidence that
the related stochastic variable trading activity deﬁned as ﬂow of trades is stochastic
variable with the long range memory [16]. We will investigate how the proposed
modulated Poisson stochastic point process can be adjusted to model trading activity
with the empirically deﬁned statistical properties. Detrended ﬂuctuation analysis [16] is
one of the methods to deﬁne the second order statistics, the autocorrelation of trading
activity. The histogram of the detrended ﬂuctuation analysis exponents ν obtained by
ﬁts for each of the 1000 US stocks shows a relatively narrow spread of ν around the
0.01 [16]. We use relation between the exponents of detrended
mean value ν = 0.85
ﬂuctuation analysis and the exponents of power spectrum β = 2ν
1 [17] and in this way
deﬁne the empirical value of the exponent for the power spectral density β = 0.7. Our
analysis of the Lithuanian stock exchange data conﬁrmed that the power spectrum of
trading activity is the same for various liquid stocks even for the emerging markets [18].
The histogram of exponents obtained by ﬁts to the cumulative distributions of trading
activites of 1000 US stocks [16] gives the value of exponent λ = 4.4
0.05 describing
the power-law behavior of the trading activity. Empirical values of β = 0.7 and λ = 4.4
conﬁrm that the time series of the trading activity in real markets are fractal with the
power law statistics. Time series generated by stochastic process (8) are fractal in the
same sense.

Nevertheless, we face serious complications trying to adjust model parameters to
the empirical data of the ﬁnancial markets. For the pure multiplicative model, when
µ = 1 or η = 3/2, we have to take γσ = 0.85 to get β = 0.7 and γσ = 1.7 to get
λ = 4.4, i.e. it is impossible to reproduce the empirical PDF and power spectrum with
the same relaxation parameter γσ and exponent of multiplicativity µ. We have proposed
possible solution of this problem in our previous publications [14, 18] deriving PDF for
the trading activity N

When N

Nevertheless, we cannot accept this as the suﬃciently accurate model of the
trading activity as the empirical power law distribution is achieved only for very high
values of the trading activity. Probably this reveals the mechanism how the power
law distribution converges to normal distribution through the growing values of the
exponent, but empirically observed power law distribution in wide area of N values
cannot be reproduced. Let us notice here that the desirable power law distribution of
the trading activity with the exponent λ = 4.4 may be generated by the model (8)

with η = 5/2 and γσ = 0.7. Moreover, only the smallest values of τ or high values
of n contribute to the power spectral density of trading activity [13]. This suggests
us to combine the point process with two values of µ: (i) µ
0 for the main area
of diﬀusing τ and n and (ii) µ = 1 for the lowest values of τ or highest values of
n. Therefore, we introduce a new stochastic diﬀerential equation for n combining two
powers of multiplicative noise,

Eqs. (13) and (14) deﬁne related stochastic variables n = 1

τ and τ , respectively, and
they should reproduce the long range statistical properties of the trading activity and
of waiting time in the ﬁnancial markets. We verify this by the numerical calculations.
In ﬁgure 1 we present the power spectral density calculated for the equivalent processes
(13) and (14) (see [14] for details of calculations). This approach reveals the structure
of the power spectral density in wide range of frequencies and shows that the model
exhibits not one but rather two separate power laws with the exponents β1 = 0.33 and
β2 = 0.72. From many numerical calculations performed with the multiplicative point
processes we can conclude that combination of two power laws of spectral density arise
only when multiplicative noise is a crossover of two power laws, see (13) and (14). We
will show in the next section that this may serve as an explanation of two exponents of
the power spectrum in the empirical data of volatility for S&P 500 companies [19].

Empirical data of the trading activity statistics must be modeled by the integrated
τ0. In ﬁgure 2 we demonstrate the

distribution of the integrated signal N converges to the normal distribution (the central
limit theorem) through growing exponent of the power-law distribution and provides an
evidence that the empirically observed exponent λ = 4.4 of the power-law distribution
of N [7, 8] can be explained by the proposed model with the same parameters suitable
for description of the power spectrum of the trading activity.

The power spectrum of the trading activity N can be calculated by the Fast Fourier
Transform of the generated numerical series. As illustrated in ﬁgure 3, the exponents
β = 0.7 of the power spectrum are independent of τd and reproduce the empirical results
of the detrended ﬂuctuation analysis [7, 8].

The same numerical results can be reproduced by continuous stochastic diﬀerential
equation (13) or iteration equation (14). One can consider the discrete iterative equation

We can conclude that the long range memory properties of the trading activity in
the ﬁnancial markets as well as the PDF can be modeled by the continuous stochastic
diﬀerential equation (13). In this model the exponents of the power spectral density, β,
and of PDF, λ, are deﬁned by one parameter γσ = γ/σ2. We consider the continuous
equation of the mean interevent time τ as a model of slowly varying stochastic rate 1/τ

Numerical results show good qualitative agreement with the empirical data of
interevent time probability distribution measured from few years series of U.S. stock
data [20]. This enables us to conclude that the proposed stochastic model captures the
main statistical properties including PDF and the long range correlation of the trading
activity in the ﬁnancial markets. Furthermore, in the next section we will show that
this may serve as a background statistical model responsible for the statistics of return
volatility in widely accepted GBM of the ﬁnancial asset prices.

5. Modeling returns and volatility

We follow an approach developed in [7, 8, 16] to analyze the empirical data of price
ﬂuctuations driven by the market activity. The basic quantities studied for the individual
stocks are price p(t) and return

x(t, τd) = ln p(t + τd)

ln p(t)

−

Return x(t, τd) over a time interval τd can be expressed through the subsequent

changes δxi due to the trades i = 1, 2....N(t, τd) in the time interval [t, t + τd],

x(t, τd) =

δxi.

N (t,τd)

Xi=1

We denote the variance of δxi calculated over the time interval τd as W 2(t, τd).
If δxi are mutually independent one can apply the central limit theorem to sum (18).
This implies that for the ﬁxed variance W 2(t, τd) return x(t, τd) is a normally distributed
random variable with the variance W 2(t, τd)N(t, τd)

x(t, τd) = W (t, τd)

N(t, τd)εt.

Empirical test of conditional probability P (x(t, τd)

W (t, τd)) [7] conﬁrms its’
Gaussian form, and the unconditional distribution P (x(t, τd)) is a power-law with the
cumulative exponent 3. This implies that the power-law tails of returns are largely due to
those of W (t, τd). Here we refer to the theory of price diﬀusion as a mechanistic random
process [21, 22]. For this idealized model the short term price diﬀusion depends on
the limit order removal and this way is related to the market order ﬂow. Furthermore,
the empirical analysis conﬁrms that the volatility calculated for the ﬁxed number of
transactions has the long memory properties as well and it is correlated with real time
volatility [23]. We accumulate all these results into strong assumption that standard
deviation W (t, τd) may be proportional to the square root of the trading activity, i.e.,
W (t, τd) = k

N(t, τd). This enables us to propose a very simple model of return

6. Conclusions

Earlier proposed stochastic point process model [14, 18] as a possible model of trading
activity in the ﬁnancial markets has to be elaborated. First of all, we deﬁne that

Long-range memory model of trading activity and volatility

11

the long-range memory ﬂuctuations of trading activity in ﬁnancial markets may be
considered as background stochastic process responsible for the fractal properties of
other ﬁnancial variables. Waiting time in the sequence of trades more likely is double
stochastic process, i.e., Poisson process with the stochastic rate deﬁned as a stand-alone
stochastic variable. We consider the stochastic rate as continuous one and model it
by the stochastic diﬀerential equation, exhibiting long-range memory properties. We
reconsider previous stochastic point process as continuous process and propose the
related nonlinear stochastic diﬀerential equation with the same statistical properties
[13]. One more elaboration of the model is needed to build up the stochastic process
with the statistical properties similar to the empirically deﬁned properties of trading
activity in the ﬁnancial markets. We combine the market response function to the noise
as consisting of two diﬀerent powers: one responsible for the probability distribution
function and another responsible for the power spectral density. The proposed new
form of the continuous stochastic diﬀerential equation enables us to reproduce the
main statistical properties of the trading activity and waiting time, observed in the
ﬁnancial markets. More precise model deﬁnition enables us to reproduce power spectral
density with two diﬀerent scaling exponents. This provides an evidence that the market
behavior is dependant on the level of activity and two stages: calm and excited must
be considered. We proposed a very simple model to reproduce the statistical properties
of return and volatility. More sophisticated approach has to be elaborated to account
for the leverage eﬀect and other speciﬁc features of the market.

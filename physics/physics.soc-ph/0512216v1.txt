We study the evolution of probability distribution functions of returns, from the tick data of the
Korean treasury bond (KTB) futures and the S&P 500 stock index, which can be described by
means of the Fokker-Planck equation. We show that the Fokker-Planck equation and the Langevin
equation from the estimated Kramers-Moyal coeﬃcients are estimated directly from the empirical
data. By analyzing the statistics of the returns, we present quantitatively the deterministic and
random inﬂuences on ﬁnancial time series for both markets, for which we can give a simple physical
interpretation. We particularly focus on the diﬀusion coeﬃcient that may be signiﬁcantly important
for the creation of a portfolio.

INTRODUCTION

In the pioneering work of Bachelier [1], it has been
shown that the probability of price changes can be de-
termined in terms of the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation
and the Wiener process. Since this study was published,
many scientiﬁc researchers in this area have suggested
the stochastic models to explain how the probability den-
sity function (PDF) in delay times behaves dynamically
on rigorous statistical principles. To ﬁnd the scale invari-
ance and universality in the stochastic model is an impor-
tant and powerful issue in the statistical analysis of tick
data of various ﬁnancial markets [2, 3]. Each ﬁnancial
market has diﬀerent characteristic features but they are
expected to have some similar and scale-invariant prop-
erties in common. We wish to focus on the ﬁndings of
unique trends and on the universality in them. In this
study, we mainly analyze two diﬀerent ﬁnancial markets,
the KTB and the S&P 500 stock index. The former is
supposed to open for a short term of six months while
the latter continues without breaks except for holidays.
It is furthermore shown that there exists a similarity in
the correlation of returns for both of these markets.

Several studies on the dynamics of ﬁnancial markets
have recently focused on the understanding of the fat-
tailed PDF of the price changes. It has been shown from
previous works [4, 5] that price changes in the empirical
dollar-mark exchange rates is regarded as a stochastic
Markov process for diﬀerent delay times. Ghashghaie et
al.
[6] have discussed an analogy between the dynami-
cal high-frequency behavior of the foreign exchange mar-
ket and the short-time dynamics of hydrodynamic tur-
bulence, and they are shown to be similar to the energy
cascade from large and small time scales in the theoret-
ical model of turbulence [7, 8]. Furthermore, Ivanova et
al. [9] showed the validity of the Fokker-Planck approach

by testing the various ﬁnancial markets, i.e., NASDAQ,
NIKKEI 225, and JPY/DEM and DEM/USD currency
exchange rates.

Motivated by the work of Friedrich and Ivanova
[4, 5, 9], we apply the Fokker-Planck equation approach
to two sets of ﬁnancial data, in this case the KTB and the
S&P 500 stock index. In this paper, we derive the func-
tional form of the Fokker-Planck equation from the esti-
mated Kramers-Moyal coeﬃcients and present an equiva-
lent Langevin equation for each. In Section 2, we present
the numerical method for estimating Kramers-Moyal co-
eﬃcients from price returns of the real ﬁnancial time se-
ries. We present some results obtained by the numerical
simulations in Section 3, and our concluding remarks are
in the ﬁnal section.

II. THE FOKKER-PLANCK EQUATION AND
THE LANGEVIN EQUATION

In our study the return r(t), given by r(t) =
ln[p(t + ∆t)/p(t)] for the price p(t) at time t,
is as-
sumed to follow a Markov process. This assumption
becomes plausible by the validity of the Chapman-
Kolmogorov equation. To make a statistical analysis
of ﬁnancial markets, we consider a N -point joint PDF,
in the
p(rN , ∆tN ; rN −1, ∆tN −1; ...; r1, ∆t1). However,
case of a Markov process, it is suﬃcient to consider the
joint PDF generated by a product of the conditional
probabilities in the following way:

p(rN , ∆tN ; ...; r1, ∆t1)
= p(rN , ∆tN

In order to derive an evolution for the change of distri-
bution functions across the time scales, we should show
the validity of the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation. From
the validity of the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation, we
can obtain an eﬀective Fokker-Planck equation. This
equation is represented in terms of the diﬀerential form
as follows:

where the drift coeﬃcient D1(r, ∆t) and diﬀusion coeﬃ-
cient D2(r, ∆t) can be estimated directly from moments
Mk of the conditional probability. The relations between
coeﬃcients and moments in Kramers-Moyal expansion
are described as follows:

We analyze two diﬀerent databases, the KTB 503 and
the S&P 500 stock index. The KTB 503 is a minutely
tick-by-tick data set consisting of 13282 quotes taken
from 1st October 2004 to 31st March 2005, and the S&P
500 stock index is a daily data set consisting of 14027
quotes taken from 1950 to 2005. From both data sets
we measure the price returns r(t) for analysis, which is
very useful to see the gain or loss of an asset in a given
time period. Both time series are plotted together with
the returns of the time delay ∆tmax = 32 minutes and
32 days for the KTB 503 and S&P 500 stock index, re-
spectively in Fig. 1. We consider a logarithmic time

multaneous occurrence of price returns, as shown in Fig.
3.

We can obtain approximately conditional probabilities
by counting the simultaneous events belonging to each
bin by which the corresponding events can be divided
(see Fig. 4).

Fig. 5 shows the matrix representation of conditional
probabilities, which is a good indicator for proving the
validity of the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation for the
empirical data. The matrix is generated from a histogram
with 100 discretionary steps over the range of r(t). There
are visible deviations in the outer region of returns, which
are probably due to the ﬁnite resolution of the statistics
and to the small number of data set, where ∆tmax = 32
days and 32 minutes for S&P500 stock index and the
KTB503, respectively.

To calculate Mk approximately we apply the condi-
tional PDF obtained from the procedure, as shown in
Figs. 3 and 4. We set ∆τ = ln 2 in the estimation of
Dk, and the functional r dependence of D1 and D2 is
shown in Fig. 6. We conﬁrmed that there is no signiﬁ-
cant diﬀerence in the estimated coeﬃcients when varying
∆tmax, provided that the ∆t is ﬁxed. For all scales t and
∆t, the functional dependence of D1 and D2 behaves in
the same manner. D1 shows a linear dependence on re-
turns, while D2 is approximated by a polynomial of two
degrees in the logarithmic returns. As speciﬁed in Ref.
[4] we add an exponential term to correct the delicate
diﬀerences in the minimum values of D2 although this is
too small to be considered signiﬁcant. By analyzing the
plots in Fig. 6, we obtained the following approximations
for the KTB503 and S&P 500 stock index: For S&P 500

the Kramers-Moyal coeﬃcients vanish for k

ment of Kramers-Moyal coeﬃcients vanishes. In Eq. (9)
and (11), the exponential terms are too small to be negli-
gible when compared to other terms. Hence, from the es-
timated results we can obtain a linear stochastic equation
with multiplicative noise, as a quadratic noise Ornstein-

|
where ∆t1 and ∆t2 are chosen to satisfy the condition,
τ = ln 2. The analogy between turbulence and the for-
eign exchange market was well described and argued in
Ref. [4]. Here we extend the argument to the stock and
futures exchange markets. Although, as mentioned pre-
viously, the KTB503 has a short-term expiration diﬀer-
ent from the S&P500 stock index, they both show good
agreement in the form of the Kramers-Moyal coeﬃcients.
We here stress again that the Fokker-Planck approach
can be a suitable method to analyze the ﬁnancial tick
data and in understanding the statistics of their returns.
Furthermore, we present a nonlinear Langevin equation,

r(τ ) =

0.78r(τ ) + √0.58r(τ )f (τ ).

(13)

From Eqs. (8)-(11) we can see that the KTB503 has a
greater drift and diﬀusion coeﬃcients than the S&P500
stock index. This implies that the former is more dy-
namic than the latter. Furthermore, the volatility of re-
turns has considerable inﬂuence upon the deterministic
trend in that the diﬀusion coeﬃcient D2 is somewhat
comparable to the drift coeﬃcient D1.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have showed that the Fokker-Planck approach can
be a good method for the analysis of the ﬁnancial mar-
kets in a wide spectrum. Even for a short-term expired
ﬁnancial market such as the Korean treasury bond fu-
tures we could obtain a well-ﬁtted result describing the
behavior of its PDF in time delays. We have also ob-
tained the same stochastic process from both analyzed
ﬁnancial markets irrespective of their data acquisition
frequency. Quantitative measurements of deterministic

and random inﬂuences for both futures and stock mar-
kets imply that the futures market is more dynamic than
the stock market.

This paper has shown that the temporal correlation
of the futures market can be described well in terms of
Fokker-Planck equations. Particularly, the KTB503 is
transacted for a short term of six months in the Korean
ﬁnancial market, but it is striking that its functional form
of the Kramers-Moyal coeﬃcients is approximately con-
sistent with that of other assets. Moreover, the compar-
ison of the drift and diﬀusion coeﬃcients with various
ﬁnancial markets provides us with a numerical indicator
for the creation of portfolios and risk management strate-

5

gies. In the future, it will be of interest to compare our
results with those of other national options. Thereby we
can measure and compare the stability and the eﬃciency
of various ﬁnancial markets.

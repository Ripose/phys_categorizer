Abstract. We study a simple, solvable model that allows us to investigate eﬀects
of credit contagion on the default probability of individual ﬁrms, in both portfolios of
ﬁrms and on an economy wide scale. While the eﬀect of interactions may be small in
typical (most probable) scenarios they are magniﬁed, due to feedback, by situations
of economic stress, which in turn leads to fatter tails in loss distributions of large loan
portfolios.

1. Introduction

E-mail:

Modelling credit risk in a coherent yet applicable manner is an important yet challenging
problem. The diﬃculties arise from the combination of a large, and co-dependent set of
risk parameters such as default rates, recovery rates, or exposures, which are correlated
and non-stationary in time. An additional issue is that of credit contagion [1, 2, 4],
which examines the role of counter-party risk in credit risk modelling. If a ﬁrm is in
economic distress, or defaults, this will implications for any ﬁrm which is economically
inﬂuenced by this given ﬁrm, for example, a service provider to it, purchaser of its goods
or a bank with a credit line to the ﬁrm. The direct correlations between ﬁrms caused by
credit contagion lead to further complications in modelling the overall, either portfolio
or economy wide, level of risk. Jarrow and Yu [1] introduced a framework of primary
and secondary ﬁrms, the former would default depending on some background stochastic
process while the latter were aﬀected by a stochastic process and the performance of
the primary ﬁrms. They argued that this was a reasonable level of detail for their
purposes and it also simpliﬁes matters as there are no feedback loops in the system.
Secondary ﬁrms depend only on primary ﬁrms whose performance is independent of
the secondary ﬁrms. Another approach for modelling credit contagion dynamics was
provided by Giesecke and Weber [2] who used the well known voter process [3], from
the theory of interacting particle systems, to model interactions between ﬁrms. They
assumed a regular structure for their ﬁrms (a regular hyper-cubic lattice) and focussed
on the equilibrium properties of their model. Davis and Lo [4] considered a model in

Credit contagion and credit risk

which defaults occur either directly, or through infection by another defaulted ﬁrm,
with probabilities for direct default or infection taken uniform throughout the system.
Defaults occurring due to both, endogenous or exogenous causes were not considered in
their set-up.

There are a variety of techniques for modelling the correlations between ﬁrms’
default behaviour, which is a major complication in credit risk modelling. The binomial
expansion technique assumes independence between ﬁrms so that the number of defaults
in a portfolio is described by a binomial distribution. In order to capture the eﬀects
of correlations a binomial distribution with an “eﬀective” number of ﬁrms is assumed
which is smaller than the actual number in the portfolio, but the weight given to
each ﬁrm scaled so as to keep the mean number of defaults constant, while the
variance of the overall number of defaults is increased. The relationship between
the true number of ﬁrms and the eﬀective reduced number is a modelling choice that
depends on the diversity of the ﬁrms in terms of sectors, geographic locations or any
other identiﬁable trait that would lead to strong correlations in default behaviour.
JP Morgans’ CreditMetrics approach [5] and Credit Suisse First Financial Products
CreditRisk+ [6] (see [7] for a detailed comparison between the two) uses the correlations
in equity values as a surrogate for the correlations in credit quality. The structural
modelling approach goes back a long way to work by Merton [8] which directly models
the dynamics of a ﬁrm’s assets, with default being triggered by the asset value hitting
some predetermined value (which henceforth we take without loss of generality to be
zero). Correlations between ﬁrms are due to correlations in the dynamics of diﬀerent
ﬁrms’ assets. This approach is very general, as it is relatively transparent to identify
diﬀerent driving forces of asset levels and straightforward to include them in the model
(though the resulting model itself will be non-trivial). However, it suﬀers from the fact
that the asset level is not an observable quantity [9]. On the other hand, the reduced
form approach gives default rates for a given ﬁrm without modelling the underlying
default process. Correlations are then directly introduced between the default rates.
There was some discussion in the literature about whether the reduced form model
could describe the true level of default correlations seen empirically but Yu [10] seems
to have answered this question in the aﬃrmative if a suitable structure between the
default rates is taken into account.

The approach we take here is a discrete time Markov process (at the microeconomic
level) where the probability of a default of a given ﬁrm in a particular time step depends
materially on the state of its economic partners at the start of that time step, as
well as on macro-economic inﬂuences. Using techniques developed in the statistical
mechanics of disordered systems, and recently applied to this speciﬁc model in [11],
we are able to solve our model exactly, and given our assumptions that we describe
shortly, this solution takes a particularly simple form despite the fact that in principle we
have feedback correlations, non-equilibrium dynamics and in principle non-Markovian
behaviour at the macroscopic (economy/portfolio wide) level. We note that it is possible
to frame our model in either the structural approach or the reduced form approach,

Credit contagion and credit risk

depending on requirements and taste, although the interpretation of the variables in
the two approaches will of course be diﬀerent. We ﬁnd that the correlations introduced
through credit contagion lead to large increases in default rates in times of economic
stress, above and beyond those introduced by simple macro-economic dependencies.
This has strong implications for portfolio risk management.

2. The microeconomic framework

We will analyse an economy of N ﬁrms in the large N limit. Generally, we focus on the
characteristic changes in the economy due to interactions between ﬁrms, which will be
described in a probabilistic manner.

As mentioned in the introduction we take a discrete time approach. For clarity
we restrict our discussion to a one year time frame split into twelve steps; this is not
essential, but parameters may need rescaling depending on the set-up. We use a binary
indicator variable ni,t to denote whether ﬁrm i is solvent at time t (ni,t = 0) or has
defaulted (ni,t = 1). The default process is a function of an underlying stochastic
process for each ﬁrm in terms of a “wealth” variable Wi,t, where we assume default if
the wealth drops below zero. We shall assume that recovery from default over the time
horizon of a year is not possible, so that the defaulted state is absorbing. As a function
of the wealth, therefore, the indicator variables evolve according to

ni,t+1 = ni,t + (1

ni,t)Θ(

Wi,t) ,

−

−

where Θ(. . .) is the Heavyside function.

A dynamic model for the indicator variables is obtained from (1) by specifying the
underlying stochastic process for the wealth variables Wi,t. We shall take it to be of the
form

Wi,t = ϑi

Jijnj,t

ηi,t .

−

N

−

j=1
X

Here ϑi denotes an initial wealth of ﬁrm i at the beginning of the risk horizon, and Jij
quantiﬁes the material impact on the wealth of ﬁrm i that would be caused by a default
of ﬁrm j. This may or may not be a reduction in wealth, depending on whether j has
a cooperative (Jij > 0) or a competitive (Jij < 0) economic relation with i.

We shall assume that the ﬂuctuating contributions ηi,t to (2) are zero-mean
Gaussians. There is still some degree of ﬂexibility concerning the decomposition of
the ηi,t into contributions that are intrinsic to the ﬁrm and extrinsic contributions. The
latter describe the inﬂuence of economy-wide ﬂuctuations or ﬂuctuations pertaining
to diﬀerent economic sectors, depending on the level of detail required. We restrict
ourselves to a minimal model containing a single macro-economic factor (assumed to be
constant over a risk horizon of a year), and individual ﬂuctuations for each ﬁrm,

Up to this point the wealth dynamics does not contain an endogenous drift.
If
predictions are required over longer time periods then it may also be pertinent to
introduce such a drift, e.g. by using a time-dependent ϑi for example, ϑi,t = ϑi(0)ezit,
where zi denotes an intrinsic growth rate of the average wealth of ﬁrm i (with zi > 0
for a ﬁrm making proﬁts and zi < 0 for a ﬁrm making losses). However, for the current
purposes of examining default rates over the medium term and especially focussing on
the behaviour on the tails, this adjustment does not lead to signiﬁcant changes in our
overall conclusion.

N

The model, as formulated above, clearly takes a structural point of view on
the problem of credit contagion. However, we note that the dynamics (1) of the
indicator variables is clearly independent of the scale of the wealth variables Wi,t. By
appropriately rescaling the initial wealths ϑi and the impact parameters Jij we can
thus assume a unit-scale σi
1 for the noise variables (3). Interestingly, this simple
rescaling, which leaves the dynamics of the system unaﬀected, amounts to changing to
a reduced-form interpretation of the dynamics.

where Φ(

is just the intensity of default of ﬁrm i at time step t (in a given economic environment
speciﬁed by the set of ﬁrms defaulted at time t). This allows us to re-interpret the
(rescaled) initial wealth and impact variables ϑi and Jij in terms of the bare default
probabilities [11, 12, 13]. I.e., if company i has an expected default probability of pi in
a given time unit (e.g. one month in the present set-up) as predicted from tables from
Φ−1(pi). Similarly, the expected default probability pi|j of
ratings agencies, then ϑi =
Φ−1(pi).
ﬁrm i, given that only ﬁrm j has defaulted leads to the value Jij = Φ−1(pi|j)
In determining the model parameters by the method suggested above we are
splitting our default probability into terms that come from credit contagion and other

fairly be argued that the historical data already incorporate the credit contagion terms
and thus we are double counting. As we will see later in numerical simulations, the
credit contagion terms make very little diﬀerence to average behaviour and thus making
estimates based on average historical data is still a reasonable approach.

We assume that the average connectivity c of each ﬁrm is large in the limit of a large
economy; this will allow the inﬂuence of partner ﬁrms to be described by the central
limit theorem and the law of large numbers. Concerning the values of the (non-zero)
impact parameters, we parametrise them as shown, with xij assumed to be zero-mean,
unit-variance random variables, with ﬁnite moments, and independent in pairs,

xij = 0 ,

ij = 1 ,

(7)

The parameters J0 and J determine mean and variance of the interaction strengths; the
scaling of mean and variance with c and √c respectively in (5) is necessary to allow
a meaningful large c limit to be taken. Taking J0 > 0 would encode the fact that on
average ﬁrms have a synergy with their economic partners.

At ﬁrst sight, specifying the Jij appears to introduce a vast number of parameters
into our model, but in fact only the ﬁrst two moments of the distribution of interaction
strengths are suﬃcient to determine the macroscopic behaviour of the system, and so
the model space is not too large.

Let us now turn to the capital required to be held against credit risk. In the BASEL

II document [14] the capital requirement for a unit-size loan given to ﬁrm i is

The ﬁrst factor, the loss given default LGDi of ﬁrm i, is related to the average fraction
of a loan that can be recovered despite default. The last factor, Mi, is related to the
maturity (long dated loans are inherently riskier). Adjustments related to liquidity (low
liquidity loans are risker) and concentration (fewer, larger loans give a greater variance
in returns for given expected return) are occasionally also included in this factor —
concentration-adjustments, in fact, are a means to account for reduced granularity in a
credit portfolio resulting from the possibility of credit contagion.

The factor inside square brackets in (8) is entirely related to the loss-frequency
distribution. The ﬁrst term is the value of the loss frequency not exceeded with
probability q = 0.999 under ﬂuctuating macro-economic conditions, with ρi describing
the dependence of the ﬁrm’s loss-frequency on the macro-economic factor. The second
term is the average loss frequency. The value of the conﬁdence level q is in principle
arbitrary, but is related to the target rating of the bank. The risk weighted asset is
then found by further multiplying by terms such as the exposure at default (i.e. size of
the loan). Thus the capital required for ﬁrm i can be viewed as the loss at the 99.9th

percentile level of stress, in excess of the expected loss, multiplied by a conversion
factor. From this structure it is clear that a key ingredient for the capital adequacy
requirements is a good model of credit risk that works well into the tail of the loss
frequency distribution.

Returning to our description of default dynamics, let us ﬁrst focus on the case of
i, j, and consider a single epoch for our model with
independent ﬁrms, with Jij = 0
ﬂuctuating forces given by (3) at given macro-economic condition η0. The probability of
a default of ﬁrm i with average unconditional monthly default probability pi occurring

Since the probability of default is increasing with η0, we can ﬁnd the probability of
default not exceeded at e.g. the 99.9 percent conﬁdence level; it is given by setting
η0 = Φ−1(0.999) in the above equation (recall η0 is distributed as a zero-mean, unit-
variance Gaussian random number). As above, the excess capital required is the loss at
the 99.9th percent level minus the expected loss (multiplied by a risk factor). However,
when we consider the case of an interacting economy with non-zero Jij, we ﬁnd that in

is the fraction of ﬁrms within the economy that have defaulted up to time t; we also
expressed the expected monthly default rate pi in terms of a ‘rescaled initial wealth’ ϑi,
Φ−1(pi) =

ϑi.

Thus we ﬁnd that our formulation is very similar to that used in BASEL II. However,
we directly take account of the correlations in defaults caused by credit contagion.
This introduces two extra parameters into the model but it does markedly change the
behaviour in the tails of the loss frequency distribution, and thereby in the tails of the
loss distribution itself. Correlation between ﬁrms is essentially a dynamic phenomenon
— if there is no dynamics, there is no way for one’s ﬁrms’ performance to inﬂuence
the viability of any other ﬁrm. Thus rather than considering ﬁrms to be independent
over a single epoch which lasts the entire period of any loan, we split the overall time
(e.g. one year) into smaller units (e.g. one month) and let the ﬁrms evolve over these
smaller time units with the default probability adjusted (since the default event in 12
monthly epochs is compounded 12 times as opposed to a single epoch). A ﬁrm may
default at any point, but will then inﬂuence its partner ﬁrms for the remainder of the
time horizon. The complexity of the theory is merely linear in time, thus it is not a
great computational burden to choose this approach.

Following the approach described in [11] it is possible to solve the model in a
stochastic manner. Credit contagion within this model is encoded at each time by a

Note that credit contagion aﬀects the dynamics of defaults only via two parameters,
J0 and J, which characterise the mean and variance of the impact parameter
distribution. Note also that the parameter α which quantiﬁes forward-backward
correlation of mutual impacts according to (7) does not appear in the ﬁnal formulation,
nor are there any memory-eﬀects in the dynamics, as would normally be expected for
systems of this type. The reason for this simplifying feature is in the fact that the
defaulted state is taken to be absorbing over the risk horizon of one year.

→

3. Results

We now turn to presenting a few key results of our analysis. Our results concerning
default dynamics and loss distributions are obtained for an economy in which the
parameters ϑi determining unconditional monthly default probabilities pi according to
Φ−1(pi), are normally distributed with mean ϑ0 = 2.75, and variance σ2
ϑi =
ϑ = 0.1
so that typical monthly bare default probabilities are in the 10−5
10−3 range. The
couplings to the macro-economic factor are chosen to depend on the expected default
probabilities according to the Basel II prescription (4).

−

−

In Fig. 1 we we show that renormalisation (with respect to credit contagion)
makes little diﬀerence to the typical default dynamics. The evolution of the fraction of
defaulted ﬁrms in interacting economies diﬀers hardly from that of the non-interacting
economy with Jij = 0

(J0, J) = (0, 0).

In marked contrast to this, the tails of loss-frequency and loss distributions are
strongly aﬀected by the presence of interactions in the system, as shown in Figs. 2 and
3. We note that the tails of the loss-frequency distribution and the loss distribution
are more pronounced than in our previous study [11]. This solely due to the fact that
in the present paper we followed the Basel II suggestion that relates the coupling of a
company to macro-economic factors with its default probability via (4).

by the law of large numbers, where ℓ = ℓ(ϑ) is the mean of the loss distribution

with a parameter ε preventing divergence as pi
In this way, the contribution
to the total losses will be approximately uniform over the bands of diﬀerent default
probabilities. The distribution of the economy-wide losses per node is driven by the
distribution of the macro-economic factor, and is computed analytically as shown in
[11]. A typical result is shown in Fig. 3, for which we chose the scale ℓ0 = 1 and the
regularizer ε = 0.005. Once more economic interactions are seen to strongly aﬀect the
tail of the loss distribution at large losses, which is due to the possibility of avalanches
of loss events in times of extreme economic stress.

Note that we have been dealing here with “synthetic” parameter distributions for
averages of loss distributions, as well as bare monthly failure probabilities. These could
be replaced by realistic ones without aﬀecting the general set-up. We have not looked
speciﬁcally at ﬁnite size eﬀects here. In [11] it was shown that they are fairly small.

4. Conclusion

In this paper we have looked to incorporate the risk due to credit contagion into
the internal ratings based approach discussed in BASEL II. While the mathematical
subtleties are discussed in full detail elsewhere [11], essentially the large number of
neighbours assumed for ﬁrms means that the law of large numbers and central limit
theorems apply to the interactions, meaning that our theory requires only two more
parameters than the BASEL II approach. In terms of risk, one of the striking results
is that while the eﬀect of interactions is relatively weak in typical economic scenarios,
it is pronounced in times of large economic stress, which leads to a signiﬁcant fattening

Credit contagion and credit risk

10

of the tails of the portfolio loss distribution. This has implications on the ﬁtting of loss
distributions to historical data, where care must be taken not only to ﬁt the average
behaviour but also to take care with the more extreme events.

This touches the issue of model calibration discussed in greater detail in [13].
We note that our model requires bare default probabilities and conditional default
probabilities as inputs. Historical data, however only contain interaction-renormalised
default probabilities, and thus the problem arises of how to disentangle the two eﬀects.
Concerning typical behaviour, Fig. 1 shows that the eﬀect of interactions is fairly small,
and interaction-renormalised default probabilities can, to a ﬁrst approximation within
this model, be taken as substitutes for the bare ones. Concerning conditional default
probabilities, these would have to be obtained from reﬁned rating procedures; see [13].
Interestingly, however, only the low order statistics of these are needed to describe the
collective dynamics of the system. Their eﬀect manifests itself only in situations of
economic stress, generating fat tails in portfolio loss distributions.

The model we have proposed is relatively simple in two important respects. Firstly,
we do not take into account credit quality migration but have just two states for our
ﬁrms, solvent or defaulted. The model could be extended to allow for more states for
each ﬁrm, although the full complexity of non-Markovian dynamics would resurface in
an attempt to take credit quality migration along these lines into account. Secondly,
the ﬁrms and their environment are rather homogeneous, which in practical situations is
of course an approximation. This approximation has been made for convenience rather
than out of necessity; the techniques described in [11] can be adapted so as to treat
situations with more heterogeneity in local environments. We intend to work on some
of these possible model generalisations in the future.

One advantage of our simple model is that it is exactly solvable and the solution
itself is not overly involved theoretically or computationally, and we only need to
introduce two extra parameters to quantify the eﬀect of economic interactions —
compared to the BASEL II approach, which ignores credit contagion altogether.

Abstract. Simple stochastic exchange games are based on random allocation of ﬁnite resources. These

games are Markov chains that can be studied either analytically or by Monte Carlo simulations. In partic-

ular, the equilibrium distribution can be derived either by direct diagonalization of the transition matrix,

or using the detailed balance equation, or by Monte Carlo estimates. In this paper, these methods are

introduced and applied to the Bennati-Dragulescu-Yakovenko (BDY) game. The exact analysis shows that

the statistical-mechanical analogies used in the previous literature have to be revised.

ter Inequality Process (OPIP) that can be deﬁned as fol-

lows. Let us suppose that there are g players in a room,

each of them with an initial amount of money, ni(0) =

n/g. Two individuals are randomly selected to play against

each other. They ﬂip a coin and the winner gets a ﬁxed

fraction, ω, of the loser’s money. Then the game is iter-

ated. If j and k are the selected players at step t, their

amount of money at step t + 1 is given by:

nj(t + 1) = nj(t) + ωd(t + 1)nk(t) − ω(1 − d(t + 1))nj(t),

To summarize, the BDY game can be described as

follows. Let us consider a system of g > 1 individuals

(agents) who share n coins, n ≥ g. At each discrete time

step two agents are chosen, and they toss a coin. At the

end of the bet, the winner has one more coin and the loser

has one coin less (d = 1 is assumed, without loss of gener-

ality). Agents’ choice is random (i.e. each distinct couple

has the same probability to be extracted) and each bet is

fair. If the loser has no coins, then the move is forbidden

and

and a new couple of players is extracted. An equivalent

nk(t + 1) = nk(t) − ωd(t + 1)nk(t) + ω(1 − d(t + 1))nj(t),

where d(t) is a Bernoullian random variable assuming the

value 1 with probability 1/2 or the value 0 with probability

1/2. Angle has studied the equilibrium distribution for the

formulation of the game, avoiding forbidden moves, is the

following. An agent is chosen randomly among all those

having at least one coin, and this agent is declared to be

the loser; the winner is chosen randomly among all agents.

In this section, the results of Monte Carlo simulations are

compared with the exact equilibrium wealth distribution.

The simulations have been performed on a standard desk-

top computer equipped with a 1GHz processor. In the

initial state all the agents are given the same amount of

coins. After an equilibration run of 1000 MC steps, the

is a few seconds.

It is interesting to remark that for small values of g

the distribution is strongly dependent on g: it is uniform

for g = 2, linear for g = 3, parabolic for for g = 4,. . ..

Except for the very peculiar case g = 2, the distribution

is decreasing for i > 1, but in some cases E(z0) < E(z1).

their beliefs, some scholars could also dislike this feature.

APPENDIX

Replies to the objections in [13,14] have already ap-

peared in two papers by Angle [15] and by McCauley [16].

In particular, Angle presents various arguments in favour

of parsimonious exchange games, including their ability to

reproduce empirical facts [17].

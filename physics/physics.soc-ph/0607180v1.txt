How Do Output Growth Rate Distributions Look Like?
Some Time-Series Evidence on OECD Countries

Giorgio Fagiolo,∗ Mauro Napoletano,† and Andrea Roventini‡
(Dated: July 2006)
Abstract
This paper investigates the statistical properties of within-country GDP and industrial production
(IP) growth rate distributions. Many empirical contributions have recently pointed out that cross-
section growth rates of ﬁrms, industries and countries all follow Laplace distributions. In this work,
we test whether also within-country, time-series GDP and IP growth rates can be approximated by
tent-shaped distributions. We ﬁt output growth rates with the exponential-power (Subbotin) family
of densities, which includes as particular cases both the Gaussian and the Laplace distributions.
We ﬁnd that, for a large number of OECD countries including the U.S., both GDP and IP growth
rates are Laplace distributed. Moreover, we show that fat-tailed distributions robustly emerge even
after controlling for outliers, autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity.

I.

INTRODUCTION

In recent years, empirical cross-section growth rate distributions of diverse economic enti-
ties (i.e., ﬁrms, industries and countries) have been extensively explored by both economists
and physicists [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].

The main result of this stream of literature was that, no matter the level of aggregation,
growth rates tend to cross-sectionally distribute according to densities that display tails
fatter than those of a Gaussian distribution. From an economic point of view, this implies
that growth patterns tend to be quite lumpy: large growth events, no matter if positive or
negative, seem to be more frequent than what a Gaussian model would predict.

For example, at the microeconomic level, growth rates of U.S. manufacturing ﬁrms
(pooled across years) appear to distribute according to a Laplace[1, 4]. This result robustly
holds even if one disaggregates across industrial sectors and/or considers cross-section dis-
tributions in each given year [5, 6]. Moreover, in some countries (e.g., France) ﬁrm growth
Interestingly, similar
rates display tails even fatter than those of a Laplace density [9].
ﬁndings are replicated at higher aggregation levels: both growth rates of industrial sectors
[7, 10] and countries [2, 3, 7] display tent-shaped patterns.

Existing studies have been focusing only on cross-section distributions. In this paper, on
the contrary, we ask whether fat-tailed distributions also emerge across time within a single
country. More precisely, for any given country, we consider GDP and industrial production
(IP) time series and we test whether their growth rate distributions can be well approximated
by densities with tails fatter than the Gaussian ones.

Our analysis shows that in the U.S. both GDP and IP growth rates distribute according to
a Laplace. Similar results hold for a large sample of OECD countries. Interestingly enough,
this evidence resists to the removal of outliers, heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation from
the original time series. Therefore, fat-tails emerges as a inherent property of output growth
residuals, i.e. a fresh stylized fact of output dynamics.

Our work diﬀers from previous, similar ones [2, 3, 7] in a few other respects. First, we
depart from the common practice of using annual data to build output growth rate distribu-
tions. We instead employ monthly and quarterly data. This allows us to get longer series and
better appreciate their business cycle features. Second, we ﬁt output growth rates with the
exponential-power (Subbotin) distribution [11], which encompasses Laplace and Gaussian
distributions as special cases. This choice allows us to measure how far empirical growth
rate distributions are from the Normal benchmark [31]. Finally, we check the robustness
of our results to the presence of outliers, heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation in output
growth rate dynamics.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section II we describe our data and the methodology
we employ in our analysis. Empirical results are presented in Section III. Finally, Section
IV concludes.

II. DATA AND METHODOLOGY

Our study employs two sources of (seasonally adjusted) data. As far as the U.S. are
concerned, we employ data drawn from the FRED database. More speciﬁcally, we consider
quarterly real GDP ranging from 1947Q1 to 2005Q3 (235 observations) and monthly IP
from 1921M1 to 2005M10 (1018 observations). Analyses for the OECD sample of countries

are performed by relying on monthly IP data from the “OECD Historical Indicators for
Industry and Services” database (1975M1 − 1998M12, 287 observations).
The main object of our analysis is output growth rate g(t), deﬁned as:

g(t) =

Y (t) − Y (t − 1)
Y (t − 1)

∼= y(t) − y(t − 1) = dy(t),

(1)

where Y (t) is the output level (GDP or IP) at time t in a given country, y(t) = log[Y (t)]
and d is the ﬁrst-diﬀerence operator.

Let Tn = {t1, ..., tn} the time interval over which we observe growth rates. The distri-
bution of growth rates is therefore deﬁned as GT = {g(t), t ∈ Tn}. We study the shape of
GTn in each given country following a parametric approach. More precisely, we ﬁt growth
rates with the exponential-power (Subbotin) family of densities [32], whose functional form
reads:

f (x) =

where a > 0, b > 0 and Γ(·) is the Gamma function. The Subbotin distribution is thus
characterized by three parameters: a location parameter m, a scale parameter a and a shape
parameter b. The location parameter controls for the mean of the distribution. Therefore
it is equal to zero up to a normalization that removes the average growth rate. The scale
parameter is proportional to the standard deviation.

The shape parameter is the crucial one for our aims, as it directly gives information
about the fatness of the tails: the larger b, the thinner are the tails. Note that if b = 1
the distribution reduces to a Laplace, whereas for b = 2 we recover a Gaussian. Values of b
smaller than one indicate super-Laplace tails (see Figure 1 for an illustration).

In our exercises, we ﬁt empirical distributions GTN with the Subbotin density (2) by
jointly estimating the three parameters by a standard maximum likelihood procedure (see
[12] for details).

III. EMPIRICAL RESULTS

In this section we present our main empirical results. We begin with an analysis of U.S.
growth rate distributions. Next, we extend our results to other OECD countries. Finally,
we turn to a robustness analysis of growth residuals, where we take into account the eﬀects
of outliers, heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation.

A. Exploring U.S. Output Growth Rate Distributions

Let us start by some descriptive statistics on U.S. output growth rates. Table I reports
the ﬁrst four moments of U.S. time series. Standard deviations reveal that after World
War II growth rates of industrial production and GDP have been characterized by similar
volatility levels. The standard deviation of IP growth rates becomes higher if the series is
extended back to 1921. Skewness is close to zero: -0.09 for GDP and ≈ 0.33 for IP. Notice
that both the Jarque-Bera and Lilliefors normality tests reject the hypothesis that our series
are normally distributed. Furthermore, the relatively high reported kurtosis values suggest
that output growth rate distributions display tails fatter than the Gaussian distribution. In
order to better explore this evidence, we ﬁt U.S. output growth rates distribution with the
Subbotin density (see eq. 2).

display tails fatter than a normal distribution. This can be also seen from Figure 2, where
we plot the binned empirical density vis-`a-vis the ﬁtted one [34].

Next, we employ monthly industrial production (IP) as a proxy of U.S. output [35].
Notice that, by focusing on IP growth, we can study a longer time span and thus improve

the IP growth rate distribution displays tails much fatter than the Laplace distribution (see
Fig. 3 and the 2nd row of Table II), an outcome probably due to the turmoils of the Great
Depression.

Moreover, in order to better compare IP growth rate distribution with the GDP one, we
also carry out an investigation on the post war period only (1947 − 2005). Notwithstanding
this breakdown, our results remain unaltered. In the post-war period the IP growth rate
distribution exhibits the typical “tent-shape” of the Laplace density (cf. Fig. 4). This

where τ = 1, 2, ..., 6 when GDP series is employed, and τ = 1, 2, ..., 12 when IP series is
under study. In line with [13], we ﬁnd that the shape parameter estimated on GDP data
becomes higher as τ increases (cf. the top panel of Fig. 5). When we consider IP series,
bb ﬁrst falls and then starts rising (see the bottom panel of Fig. 5). Therefore, as the
the
“growth lag” increases, tails become thinner (see [14] for similar evidence in the contest of
stock returns).

B. Cross-Country Analyses

In the previous section we have provided evidence in favor of fat-tailed (Laplace) U.S.
output growth rate distributions. We now perform a cross-country analysis in order to assess
whether this regularity pertains to the U.S. output only, or it might also be observed in other
developed countries. Our analysis focuses on the following OECD countries: Canada, Japan,
Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and the
U.K. .

We start by analyzing the basic statistical properties of the output growth rate time series
(cf. Table III). In order to keep a suﬃcient time-series length, we restrict our study to the
industrial production series only. The standard deviations of the IP series range from 0.0073
(U.S.) to 0.0404 (Japan). In half of the countries that we have analyzed, the distributions
of IP growth rates seem to be slightly right-skewed, whereas in the other half they appear
to be slightly left-skewed. The analysis of the kurtosis reveals that in every country of the
sample the IP growth rate distribution is more leptokurtic than the Normal distribution.
Indeed, apart from Spain and Canada, standard normality tests reject the hypothesis that
IP growth series are normally distributed.

Given this descriptive background, we turn to a country-by-country estimation of the

Subbotin distributions. Estimated coeﬃcients are reported in Table IV.

The results of the cross-country analysis conﬁrm that output growth rates distribute
according to a Laplace almost everywhere. Excluding Canada, estimated “shape” coeﬃcients

densities robustly arises in the majority of OECD countries, it does not depend on the way
we measure output (GDP or IP), and it emerges also at frequencies more amenable for the
study of business cycles dynamics (i.e. quarterly and monthly). Notice also that our anal-
ysis does not show any clear evidence in favor of asymmetric Laplace (or Subbotin) growth
rate distributions. Hence, almost all OECD countries seem to exhibit (with a probability
higher than we would expect) large, positive growth events with the same likelihood of large,
negative ones.

This “fresh” stylized fact on output dynamics must be however scrutinized vis-`a-vis a
number of robustness checks. More precisely, the above results can be biased by two classes
of problems. First, the very presence of fat-tails in the distribution of country-level growth
rates might simply be due to the presence of outliers. Thus, one should remove such outliers
from the series and check whether fat tails are still there. Second, our within-country
analysis relies on pooling together growth rate observations over time. Strictly speaking,
the observations contained in GTn should come from i.i.d. random variables. In other words,
we should verify that fat tails do not characterize growth rates only, but they are a robust
feature of growth residuals (also known as “innovations”). To do so, one might remove the
possible presence of any structure in growth rate time series due to autocorrelation and
heteroscedasticity, and then ﬁt a Subbotin density to the residuals.

Our robustness analyses seem to strongly support the conclusion that fat-tails still char-
acterize our series also after having controlled for outliers, autocorrelation and heteroscedas-
ticity. More precisely, in the ﬁrst row of Table V we have reported the estimates of the
Subbotin parameters in the case of U.S. GDP, after having removed the most common
bb) still remains close to one,
types of outliers [15]. The estimate for the shape parameter (
thus reinforcing evidence in favor of Laplace fat-tails.

Moreover, in order to remove any structure from the growth rate process, we have ﬁtted
a battery of ARMA speciﬁcations to the growth rate time series obtained after cleanup
of outliers and we have selected the best model trough the standard Box and Jenkins’s
procedure. In Table V, second row, we report – for the case of U.S. GDP – our Subbotin
estimates for the distribution of residuals of the best ARMA model, which turns out to be
an AR(1) without drift (thus implying the presence of some autocorrelation in the original
growth rate series). However, the best ﬁt for the distribution of the AR(1) residuals is a
bb = 1.2696). Similar results hold also for the
Subbotin distribution very close to a Laplace (
IP growth rate series and are reasonably robust across our sample of OECD countries.

Finally, we ran standard Ljung-Box and Engle’s ARCH heteroscedasticity tests on our

over time.

As Figure 6 shows for U.S. GDP, fat-tailed Laplace densities seem therefore to robustly
emerge even after one washes away from the growth process both outliers and autocorrelation
(and moving-average) structure (i.e., when one considers growth residuals as the object of
analysis).

IV. CONCLUDING REMARKS

In this paper we have investigated the statistical properties of GDP and IP growth rate
time series distributions by employing quarterly and monthly data from a sample of OECD
countries.

We ﬁnd that in the U.S., as well as in almost all other developed countries of our sample,
output growth rate time series distribute according to a symmetric Laplace density. This
implies that the growth dynamics of aggregate output is lumpy, being considerably driven
by “big events”, either positive or negative. We have checked this result against a number
of possible sources of bias. We ﬁnd that lumpiness appears to be a very property of the
data generation process governing aggregate output growth, as it appears to be robust to
the removal of both outliers and auto-correlation.

At a very general and rather broad level, the robust emergence of fat-tailed distributions
for within-country time series of growth rates and residuals can be interpreted as a fresh, new
stylized fact on output dynamics, to be added to the long list of its other known statistical
properties [38].

¿From a more empirical perspective, our results (together with the already mentioned
cross-section ones [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) ought to be be interpreted together with
recent ﬁndings against log-normality for the cross-section distributions of ﬁrm and country
size [17, 18, 19, 20, 21], and on power-law scaling in cross-country per-capita GDP distri-
butions [22]. This joint empirical evidence seems to suggest that in economics the room for
normally-distributed shocks and growth processes obeying the “Law of large numbers” and
the “Central limit theorem” is much more limited than economists were used to believe.

In other words, the general hint coming from this stream of literature is in favor of an in-
creasingly “non-Gaussian” economics and econometrics. A consequence of this suggestion
is that we should be very careful in using econometric testing procedures that are heavily
sensible to normality of residuals [39]. On the contrary, testing procedures that are robust
to non-Gaussian errors and/or tests based on Subbotin- or Laplace-distributed errors should
be employed when necessary.

Finally, country-level, non-Gaussian growth rates distributions (both within-country and
cross-section) might have an important implication on the underlying generating processes.
Suppose to interpret the country-level growth rate in a certain time period as the result of
the aggregation of microeconomic (ﬁrm-level) growth shocks across all ﬁrms and industries
in the same time period. The emergence of within-country non-Gaussian growth distribu-
tions strongly militates against the idea that country growth shocks are simply the result
of aggregation of independent microeconomic shocks over time. Therefore, some strong cor-
relating mechanism linking in a similar way at every level of aggregation the units to be
aggregated seems to be in place. This interpretation is in line with the one proposed by
[2, 4, 7] who envisage the widespread presence of fat tails as an indicator of the overall
“complexity” of any growth process, mainly due to the strong inner inter-relatedness of the
economic organizations under study.

[31] A thorough comparative study on the goodness-of-ﬁt of the Subbotin distribution vis-`a-vis
alternative fat-tails distributions (e.g., Student’s-t, Cauchy, Levy-Stable) is the next point in
our agenda.

[32] More on ﬁtting Subbotin distributions to economic data is in [5, 6].
[33] The period of strong growth experienced by the U.S. economy after World War II is probably
responsible for the positive location parameter bm (0.0082), which implies a positive sample
average growth rate.

[34] As one can visually appreciate, the goodness-of-ﬁt is quite good. Preliminary results from
extensive bootstrap goodness-of-ﬁt testing exercises seems to statistically support this visual
evidence.

[35] IP tracks very closely GDP in almost all countries. More precisely, the GDP-IP cross-
correlation proﬁle mimics from time t − 6 to time t + 6 the GDP auto-correlation proﬁle.

[36] Cramer-Rao bounds are also graphically reported in Figure 5 at lag t − 1.
bb-interval is slightly below one.
[37] Another exception is Denmark, where the upper bound of its
[38] Two rather undisputed stylized facts of output dynamics – at least for the U.S. – are: (i) GNP
growth is positively autocorrelated over short horizons and has a weak and possibly insignif-
icant negative autocorrelation over longer horizons; (ii) GNP appears to have an important
trend-reverting component [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28].

Abstract

The question of optimal portfolio is addressed. The conventional
Markowitz portfolio optimisation is discussed and the shortcomings due to
non-Gaussian security returns are outlined. A method is proposed to min-
imise the likelihood of extreme non-Gaussian drawdowns of the portfolio
value. The theory is called leptokurtic, because it minimises the eﬀects
from ”fat tails” of returns. The leptokurtic portfolio theory provides an
optimal portfolio for investors, who deﬁne their risk-aversion as unwilling-
ness to experience sharp drawdowns in asset prices. Two types of risks in
asset returns are deﬁned: a ﬂuctuation risk, that has Gaussian distribu-
tion, and a drawdown risk, that deals with distribution tails. These risks
are quantitatively measured by deﬁning the ”noise kernel” – an ellipsoidal
cloud of points in the space of asset returns. The size of the ellipse is reg-
ulated with the threshold parameter: the larger the threshold parameter,
the larger return are accepted for investors as normal ﬂuctuations. The
return vectors falling into the kernel are used for calculation of ﬂuctuation
risk. Analogously, the data points falling outside the kernel are used for
the calculation of drawdown risks. As a result the portfolio optimisation
problem becomes three-dimensional: in addition to the return, there are
two types of risks involved. Optimal portfolio for drawdown-averse in-
vestors is the portfolio minimising variance outside the noise kernel. The
theory has been tested with MSCI North America, Europe and Paciﬁc
total return stock indices.

1 Introduction

The bridges between statistical physics and ﬁnancial economics have been re-
cently crossed by many of authors, cf. [1, 2, 3, 4]. The topics of research include
the descriptive statistics of the price movements, market microstructure mod-
els and many others. Recently the problem of basket of assets has attracted

attention (cf. [4, 5]). The portfolio optimisation has been introduced in 1950s
by Harry Markowitz [6]. The simplicity of portfolio optimisation problem has
made it well-accepted in ﬁnancial community (cf. [7] and references therein).
The conventional or Markowitz portfolio theory assumes the Gaussian proba-
bility distribution function for security returns – this is widely questioned in
Econophysics literature. The recent reports show that even the L´evy stable
distributions are not describing the stochastic process of price changes [8]. Fur-
thermore, the temporal organisation of the price increments is also complicated,
multifractal, c.f. [1]. Apparently, the optimal portfolio question should be recon-
sidered bearing in mind these very important ﬁndings. However, these revised
methods have to be simple and robust. Indeed, the statistical data available for
the analysis are typically insuﬃcient for a statistically meaningful application
of advanced and complicated techniques,

In this paper the theory is provided that leads to three-dimensional portfolio
optimisation. In order to keep the approach as simple as possible, we ignore
the multifractal aspects of the price movements. The risk of the portfolio is
splitted to two: Gaussian risks and “fat tail” risks. Then, the portfolio choice
is provided for the investors who want to minimise the absolute drawdowns.
First section is devoted to the discussion of the conventional portfolio theory.
Further, the Leptokurtic Portfolio Theory is introduced and the application is
provided. Finally, the approach is tested based on various international stock
indices.

2 Modern Portfolio Theory

In this section, the Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) is outlined and its short-
comings are discussed. Consider the basket of n assets (e.g. stocks) with total
value of W . Given the quantity of each stock qi, the total wealth can be ex-
n
pressed as the sum of portfolio constituents: W =
i=1 qipi, where pi is the
P
qipi/W , the portfolio value is normalised:
price of security i. By denoting wi
n
i=1 wi = 1. Note that the weights in portfolio can also be negative – this
P
means short-selling of the asset. Further, let ri(t, ∆t) be the return of the secu-
rity i in the portfolio at time t for recent period of ∆t:

≡

ri(t, ∆t)

where pi(t) denotes the price of security i at time t. As noted earlier, the sta-
tistical properties of quantity r(t) are well-elaborated in the literature. MPT
assumes the Gaussian distribution – an obvious disagreement with recent ﬁnd-
ings [8]. However, regardless of probability distribution of the security returns,
the portfolio return is simple sum of the returns of portfolio constituents:

rp(t, ∆t) =

wiri(t, ∆t)

The return of the portfolio is of course important part of investment decision.
But there are only few if none securities that do not obey any kind of risk.
Even the securities issued by the government can ﬂuctuate in value – this is
because of interest rate ﬂuctuations. So, the problem of portfolio choice is at
least two-dimensional: the optimal combination of risk and return determine
the choice of individual investor. The deﬁnition of return is given by Eq. (1).
The deﬁnition of risk is not that straightforward. In MPT, the risk σp is deﬁned
as the standard deviation of returns:

where σi,j is the covariation of returns of securities i and j; σi,i
the assumption of Gaussian returns, the measured historic values of returns and
covariations can be used as a proxy to the future. The problem, however, stays
with the fundamental assumption of MPT – the returns are not Gaussian nor
stable. Moreover, it is highly likely that the higher moments than two diverge
and the standard deviation (i.e. square root of variance) of the returns goes to
inﬁnity.

≡

Further, the variables are deﬁned that are used in MPT. The expected (i.e.
ex ante) return in time-window τ is deﬁned as average of previous realisations:

The covariance of returns for security pair is found as follows:

ηi = E(ri) =

σi,j =

If i = j then the covariance relaxes to simple variance: σi,i
Also, dimensionless correlation coeﬃcient is used that expresses the degree of
statistical dependence:

It is convenient to represent the portfolio in the matrix form. Denoting the
return and weight vectors respectively with η and w, Eq. (2) is rewritten as

where ηT is transpose of η. Further, let C be the matrix of covariation coeﬃ-
cients with elements of σi,j . The Eq. (3) becomes:

The choice of the optimal portfolio depends on individual investor’s risk
preferences. The function that describes the utility of the investor in diﬀerent

levels of wealth is called utility function. So, the choice of the portfolio in
risk-return diagram is the combination of utility function, risk preferences and
return expectations. However, the general principle is that investors prefer more
return to less on the same amount of risk; and given the return they also prefer
the least amount of risk. In Fig. 1 the ordinary risk-return diagram is given
for illustrative purposes. There are two hypothetical assets A and B that have
Gaussian return distribution and positive correlation of ρ = 30%. The weight
of security A in the portfolio was varied in range: wA

50%, 150%].

Risk

The two regions are outlined in Fig. 1: Unreachable and inferior portfolios.
The upper-left region contains the portfolios that are unreachable. They should
provide either higher return on given risk level or lower risk on given return
level. Indeed, the most desirable portfolios are those with maximum return and
no risk, but this is not possible. The lower-right region on contrary contains
the portfolios that oﬀer lower return on the same risk level or higher risk on
given return level. These portfolios are called inferior, because of existing better
investment alternatives. The line between unreachable and inferior portfolios
is called Eﬃcient frontier. It is the line that expresses the portfolios that are
optimal: maximum amount of return on given risk level and minimum amount
of risk on given return level.

3 Leptokurtic Portfolio Theory

What is the quantitavie measure of a portfolio risk in the case of strongly non-
Gaussian price ﬂuctuations with (possibly) inﬁnite variance and L´evy-like spec-

4

trum of price jumps? Note that stable L´evy distribution of price jumps assumes
diverging variance; the power law reported by X. Gabaix et al [8] assumes di-
verging kurtosis (fourth moment). In the case of diverging fourth moment, the
distributions are called leptokurtic. The tails of the leptokurtic distributions
In fact, all power-law
are ”fatter” than predicted by Gaussian distribution.
distributions lead to leptokurtic distributions and that must be accounted by
determination of risk. The obvious question arises: what is the risk of portfolios
that obey leptokurtic distribution tails? Here, a model is proposed to oﬀer the
portfolio choice under such assumptions. First, the two types of ﬂuctuations
are separated: the ﬂuctuation or Gaussian risk (which can be called a ”good”
risk, because the distribution tails approach quickly zero) and the drawdown, or
power-law risk (”bad” risk, because the actual portfolio loss can be much larger
than that of predicted by Gaussian approach). These two types of risk, together
with the expected return, create a three-dimensional space; second subsection
is devoted to the discussion of the portfolio optimisation in that space. Finally,
a simple empirical illustration is provided using international stock indices.

3.1 Separation of risks

The power-law distribution of security returns leads to a large amount of ”small”
price movements, and few ”large” movements. It is convenient to separate the
”noise kernel” of daily returns — these are the returns which are smaller than few
standard deviations. First, let us assume that the volatilities are not diverging.
Then, the ”noise kernel” is deﬁned as a set of points Q in the n-dimensional
space of returns (where i-th axes measures the return ri of the i-th asset) falling
into such an ellipsoid where the probability density function of return vectors
is above a (small) threshold. This threshold serves as a model paramater (see
below). Using the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix as the orthonormal
basis ρi, the ellipsoid is deﬁned as

n

i=1

nθ,

(9)

where λi is the i-th eigenvalue of the covariance matrix. The threshold param-
1 should be chosen in such a way that the probability for a return
eter θ
vector falling outside the ellipsoid, is of the order of few percents; it regulates
the ellipsoid ”size” in units of standard deviations. In the case of two assets,
the ellipsoid becomes ellipse, and can be expressed as

For diverging volatilities, the above outlined apporoach can be still applied;
however, the net volatility is then a non-stationary quantity and depends on the
particular observed set of extreme price movements. The eﬀect of these extreme
movements can be removed by an iterative approach: instead of using the net

5

covariance matrix for the calculation of the noise kernel, the noise kernel’s own
covariance matrix must be used.

The investors are looking for capital appreciation, in order to achieve the
investment performance targets. What the investors do not like, is ﬂuctuation
in asset prices. Indeed, everybody would be happy to see a linear appreciation
of capital with a suitable growth rate. However, investors would accept the
”normal” ﬂuctuations with a low standard deviations. What the investors really
want to avoid, is a sharp drawdown in asset prices. Thus, the risk components
should be separated to Gaussian (”good”) ﬂuctuation risk, and drawdown risk.
This is done as follows:

Deﬁnition 1. Fluctuation risk: The risk is measured as the average deviation
from average return, i.e. risk is measured with standard deviation.

Deﬁnition 2. Drawdown risk: The risk is measured as the likelihood of
sharp changes in asset prices. Risk is the degree of willingness to experience
sharp moves in asset prices.

According to MPT, the drawdown risk in not existing. This is actually not
true, if one thinks back to the history: stock market crashes have occurred quite
frequently: 1929 and 1987, 2000 in US, 1997 South-East Asia, 1998 Russia are
just some well-known examples. Our simpliﬁed approach is as follows. For
the calculation of the ﬂuctuation risk of the portfolio (Def. 1), only these data
points which are in the noise kernel are accounted for. On the other hand, the
points outside noise kernel are used for the calculation of drawdown risk of the
portfolio, and of the related covariance matrix of returns (Def. 2). Note that
the larger the threshold parameter θ, the larger ﬂuctuations are considered as
”normal” or ”acceptable”. To conclude, equations

September 1959 to March 2004 (i.e. total more than 11000 data points) and the
kernel was deﬁned with parameter θ = 3. As seen, the noise kernel and the rest
of the data have quite diﬀerent correlations.

3.2 Application of LPT

Leptokurtic Portfolio Theory (LPT) is a simple generalisation of MPT. Equa-
tions (10) and (12) yield non-trivial results only when large asset price jumps
(drawdowns) exist. The boundary between the ordinary ﬂuctuation risk and
extraordinary drawdown risk is deﬁned by the parameter θ. Here, we have pre-
sented market data analysis with θ = 3; the value θ = 2 yields similar results.
Note that in the case of Gaussian distribution, the events fall into three stan-
dard deviations with probability equal to 99.73%, which seems to be a reasonable
crossover point.

The application of LPT introduces additional dimension to the Gaussian
risk return space: non-Gaussian risks. So, the portfolios are evaluated in three-
dimensional space containing two types of risks, and the return. This allows
us to separate the ﬂuctuation and drawdown risks and the portfolio choice gets
more complicated. Investors must choose an optimal balance between the Gaus-
sian risk and return, but they have also to evaluate the potential of the ”out-
of-statistics” drawdowns. To elaborate this concept, consider the example of
Fig. 2 b). Suppose the investor is willing to invest into a combination of the
indices of SPX and DAX. If the investor is accepting the ﬂuctuations within
three standard deviations, but he is unwilling to accept the large drawdowns,
then he should invest into a portfolio with minimised drawdown risk. On the
other hand, if the low values of the average short-term Gaussian ﬂuctuation is
more highly prioritised than the desire to minimise the likelihood of drawdowns,

7

minimised kernel-risk portfolio satisﬁes the investment goal.

Equation (4) provides the deﬁnition of returns in MPT. In the spirit of LPT,
one could wish to distinguish between ”ordinary” (Gaussian) and ”extraordi-
nary” returns. However, in the case of predicted returns, such splitting seems
unjustiﬁed: ﬁrst of all, because the use of historic returns as a proxy to the
future returns is far from being justiﬁed. Indeed, due to the non-stable nature
and non-stationarity of returns, there will be large diﬀerences between short-
term realisations. This will inevitably lead to the fact that historic returns do
not provide the valid forecast to the future returns – a circumstance that is
easy to check in any ﬁnancial time series. In fact, the expected return of the
security depends also on the choice of investment horizon – it varies from in-
vestor to investor. To conclude, we leave the expected return un-splitted and
prefer more fundamental (i.e. economic result based) approach in estimating
the future returns.

3.3 Empirical evidence: the validity of LPT

In previous, we have deﬁned the idea of separation of risks and their measures.
Here, the empirical evidence is provided. We construct the portfolios by using
monthly data of the following Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI)
total return indices: MSCI Europe (hereinafter denoted as E), MSCI North
America (NA) and MSCI Paciﬁc (P) in the period from December 1969 to
February 2005 (total more than 420 months). In this paper, we only look at the
examples of pairs of securities. The portfolio problem with N securities will be
addressed in future. The method used is the following:

1. we take the pair of securities and ﬁnd the noise kernels with θ = 1, 2, 3

according to Eq. (10),

and (12),

2. we determine the kernel and non-kernel covariations according to Eqs. (11)

3. we determine the minimum-risk portfolios according to ﬂuctuation, draw-
down and Markowitz deﬁnition (the latter is simply aggregated standard
deviation of kernel and non-kernel) with parameter θ = 1, 2, 3,

4. we back-test the minimum-risk portfolios with the same data-set by in-

vesting hypothetical unit currency in December 1969

This process is illustrated with an example of MSCI North America and MSCI
Paciﬁc time series. In Table 1, the correlation matrices are presented for MPT,
Fluctuation, and Drawdown methods using the value θ = 3.
In Fig. 3, the
portfolio choice is showen using the same data as in Table 1. The risk-return
space in Fig. 3 is constructed similarly to Fig. 1:
in the abscissa, the risk in
annualised standard deviations is plotted. Note that for diﬀerent portfolio sets,
the diﬀerent deﬁnitions of covariations and standard deviations are used. The
portfolios with minimum variance are marked with circles.

In Table 2, the characteristics for the optimal portfolios (those represented in
Fig. 3, together with the θ = 3-optimal portfolios for the security pairs of North
America – Europe and Europe-Paciﬁc) are presented. For better overview, the
standard deviation and return ﬁgures are annualised by multiplying with √12
and 12, respectively.

As a last step, a simple back-test is performed with portfolios found. The
back-test model is the following: a hypothetical unit of currency is invested
into optimal portfolios found in Table 2 as of December 1969. The portfolio is
re-balanced with initial allocations found on monthly basis. LPT is valid when
the portfolios which are optimised for drawdowns provide smaller extreme draw-
downs than portfolios which are optimised for variance (i.e. MPT portfolios).
An example of the back-test’s result is provided with the data-set in Table2
section a). The results are presented in the Table 3, where the minimum, max-
imum, mean and standard deviation of returns of the hypothetical investment
into three portfolios are presented.

It is seen that the portfolio optimised for minimisation of non-kernel risk
is superior to those optimised for Gaussian risk, because of it has a) smaller
maximal drawdown, b) smaller average standard deviation, and c) higher aver-
age return. This test was carried out for all above-mentioned security pairs for
θ
[1, 5], total 15 times. In Table 4 the number of drawdown portfolios is pro-
vided that satisfy the comparison condition with the MPT portfolio. Therefore,

4 Discussion

A simple and robust method of non-Gaussian portfolio optimisation has been
devised. The concept of Gaussian noise kernel for the vector of daily asset return
vectors led us to the separation of two types of risks. The portfolios that were
designed to minimise drawdown risk provided higher average return with lower
maximum drawdowns, than the minimum-risk portfolio according to the MPT.
Although we have found very good results with the given data-sets, there is a
clear need for further extensive analysis with real data and portfolios consisting
of more than two assets.

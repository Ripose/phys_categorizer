Abstract

The traﬃc in telephone networks is analyzed in this paper. Unlike the classical
traﬃc analysis where call blockings are due to the limited channel capacity, we
consider here a more realistic cause for call blockings which is due to the way in
which users are networked in a real-life human society. Furthermore, two kinds of
user network, namely, the fully-connected user network and the scale-free network,
are employed to model the way in which telephone users are connected. We show
that the blocking probability is generally higher in the case of the scale-free user
network, and that the carried traﬃc intensity is practically limited not only by the
network capacity but also by the property of the user network.

Key words: Telephone network, traﬃc analysis, complex networks, scale-free
network.

1 Introduction

Telephone systems have undergone rapid developments in the past few decades.
With a growing number of end users and an increasing demand for greater
variety of services, operators are facing challenges in providing a variety of
communication services and at the same time maintaining an adequate level
of quality of service [1,2]. As the system has a limited capacity, it can only
support a limited amount of simultaneous traﬃc. Under this condition, traﬃc
analysis that can reﬂect the true system behavior is indispensable. In the past

few decades, several traﬃc models for communication systems have been pro-
posed [3]. They are derived by ﬁtting the existing traﬃc data under particular
sets of conditions. However, since the underlying mechanisms of the traﬃc be-
havior are unknown or simply not taken into account in the modeling process,
such models fall short of a clear connection with the actual physical processes
that are responsible for the behavior observed in the traﬃc data.

Recent studies on the so-called complex networks [4,5,6] provide a novel per-
spective for understanding the traﬃc loads in some communication systems
[7,8,9,10]. The communication networks studied are packet-switching networks,
in which the information packet goes through nodes between the source and
the destination. During the transmission process no dedicated connection is
set up. As a result, packets from diﬀerent sources may share a communication
link in the system. On the other hand, telephone networks are circuit-switching
systems, in which a dedicated channel is occupied for each telephone call. This
channel cannot be used by another user during the call holding time. Because
the mechanisms are diﬀerent, the analysis applied to the study of packet-
switching networks are not applicable to the telephone networks.

Aiello et al. [11] studied the daily traﬃc of long-distance calls in a telephone
network and found that the incoming and outgoing connections in this net-
work follow a power-law distribution. This work represents the earliest at-
tempt to understand the traﬃc performance of telephone systems. However,
the approach was based on ﬁtting the existing traﬃc data, and the underlying
mechanisms are still unexplored.

Obviously, the traﬃc performance of a telephone system is strongly correlated
with the behavior of its users. From the viewpoint of complex networks, the
users in a telephone system form a complex user network. This user network
is a social network, which exhibits small-world and scale-free properties [5]. In
our previous work [12], a scale-free user network model was used in the analysis
of telephone network traﬃc, which has resulted in a clear connection between
the user network behavior and the system traﬃc load. Speciﬁcally, we assumed
that the telephone system had an inﬁnite capacity so that we might focus our
attention on the eﬀect of user network behavior on the system traﬃc load.
However, such an assumption was ideal since no real communication system
has an inﬁnite capacity.

In this paper we consider a more complex but realistic scenario, in which both
the limited capacity and user engagement may cause call blockings and thus
inﬂuence the system traﬃc load. We illustrate how network traﬃc load can be
more realistically simulated, and show that telephone traﬃc (including mobile
network traﬃc) should be considered by taking into account both the system
capacity and the user network behavior.

2 Traﬃc analysis in telephone networks

In a telephone network, “traﬃc” refers to the accumulated number of com-
munication channels occupied by all users. Diﬀerent from the user network,
the telephone network is a directed complex network, in which each edge has
a direction from the caller to the receiver. For each user, the call arrivals can
be divided into two categories: incoming calls and outgoing calls. Here, in-
coming calls refer to those being received by a user, and outgoing calls refer
to those being initiated by that user. Since every incoming call for one user
must be originated from an outgoing call of another user, we only need to
consider outgoing calls from each user when we analyze the network traﬃc. If
not speciﬁed, the term call arrival means outgoing call arrival in the rest of
this paper.

Outgoing calls are initiated randomly. If a call arrives and the conversation is
successfully established, both the caller and the receiver will be engaged for a
certain duration commonly known as holding time. The length of the holding
time is also a random variable. Thus, the traﬃc load depends on the rate of
call arrivals and the holding time for each call. Figure 1 shows three cases of
the calling process.

Case I: Call established. When an outgoing call arrives at time t1, a receiver is
randomly selected. If this receiver is idle at that time and the network has an

3

idling channel, a call is successfully established. The caller and receiver will
be engaged for a duration of holding time (t2 − t1). The call ends at time t2.
The inter-call time (t3 − t2) is the duration between the end of this call and
the beginning of the next outgoing call arrival. Also, the inter-arrival time
is equal to the sum of the holding time and the inter-call time. This is the
normal calling process and is depicted in Fig. 1 (a).

Case II: Call blocked. Suppose two outgoing calls are made at t1 and t4. A
call blocking may occur due to two reasons. First, if the receiver is engaged
with another call at time t1, then any new call attempt will fail and a call
blocking is said to occur. Another reason for call blockings is the limited
network capacity. If all channels are occupied at time t1, the new call attempt
is blocked. The telephone network is usually considered as a “lossy” system,
in which the blocked call simply “disappears” from the network. In this case
the inter-arrival time is equal to the inter-call time (i.e., t4 − t1), as shown in
Fig. 1 (b).

Case III: Call cancelled. In this case, an outgoing call is supposed to take
place at time t7. However, if an incoming call has arrived ahead of it and
the conversation is still going on at time t7, the outgoing call attempt will
be cancelled. Since this call attempt has not been initiated, it is counted as
neither a call arrival nor a call blocking. When the conversation ends at time
t8, another inter-call time is assumed before the next outgoing call arrives at
time t9. In this case, the inter-arrival time is (t9 − t1), as illustrated in Fig. 1
(c). Of course, at time t9, it is also possible that the user is engaged with
another call. Then, the call arrival at time t9 will again be cancelled, and the
inter-arrival time will be extended accordingly.

Clearly, the shortest inter-arrival time is equal to the inter-call time, which
happens only in Case II. In our subsequent analysis, the above three cases of
the call arrival process will be considered. Here, we note that in some previous
study, simplifying assumptions are made about this process leading to drastic
simpliﬁcation of the analysis [13,14]. However, we prefer to study the traﬃc
without making any simplifying assumptions on the call arrival process to
avoid obscuring the eﬀects of the small-world scale-free networks.

The holding time and the inter-call time are usually modelled by some ran-
dom variables with exponential distribution. The probability density function
(PDF) of the holding time is given by

f1(t) =

−t/tm,
e

1
tm

(1)

where tm is the average holding time. The PDF of the inter-call time is given

4

by

f2(t) = µie−µit,

(2)

(3)

(4)

where 1/µi is the average inter-call time. The holding times are distributed
identically for all users, but the mean values of the inter-call times for diﬀerent
users may be diﬀerent.

As shown in Fig. 1, the inter-arrival times for the three cases are diﬀerent.
However, if we examine the traﬃc over a suﬃciently long period of time (e.g.,
60 min), we can obtain the average call arrival rate λi, which is the average
number of call arrivals per unit time, for user i. Thus, the average arrival rate
for the whole network is

λ =

λi,

N

X
i=1

A = 2λtm,

where N is the total number of users in the network.

A commonly used measure of traﬃc is the traﬃc intensity [3], which is deﬁned
by

and represents the average traﬃc oﬀered over a period of time. It is dimension-
less, but is customarily expressed in units of erlang. It should be noted that
there is a coeﬃcient “2” in the above equation. This is because in our study
we assume that both the caller and the receiver stay in the same telephone
network. Thus, two channels are used for each call conversation.

In a telephone network, there are two distinct kinds of traﬃc: oﬀered traﬃc
and carried traﬃc. The oﬀered traﬃc is the total traﬃc that is being requested
by users. The carried traﬃc is the actual traﬃc that is being carried by the
network. It can be found as the sum of the holding times of all call conversa-
tions. In practice, due to limited network capacity and some user behavior, a
certain percentage of the oﬀered traﬃc experiences network blocking. Hence,
the carried traﬃc is smaller than the oﬀered traﬃc. The carried traﬃc, more-
over, can be expressed by

Acarried = Aoﬀered(1 − pblocking) = 2λtm(1 − pblocking),

(5)

where Acarried and Aoﬀered denote the carried traﬃc and the oﬀered traﬃc,
respectively, and pblocking represents the blocking probability of a call.

5

The telephone network is typically measured in terms of the average activity
during the busiest hour of a day [3]. During the busiest hour, the average
contribution of one user to the traﬃc load is typically between 0.05 and 0.1
erlang. The average holding time is 3 to 4 min.

3 User network conﬁguration

Formally, we may describe a user network in terms of nodes and connections.
A node is a user, and a connection between two nodes indicates a possibility
that these two users may call each other, i.e., a connection connects a pair of
acquaintances.

In the classical traﬃc analysis, each user can call any other user with equal
probability. Thus, the user network is a fully-connected network. In such a
user network, the eﬀect of each user is assumed to be identical. However, in
reality, some users make more calls than others do. A relatively small group
of users are usually responsible for most of the calls and hence are having
a comparatively bigger impact to the traﬃc. Our basic assumption of the
user network is that it is not uniform, i.e., a user does not call every user in
the network with equal probability. In fact, users usually only call their own
acquaintances, such as family members, colleagues and friends. If a user has
more acquaintances, the probability of him making/receiving a call at any
time is higher. Thus, in the real user network, user i only has ni connections
which connect him to his ni acquaintances.

The user network conﬁguration is shown in Fig. 2, which assumes a typical
small-world conﬁguration [4]. Speciﬁcally, each node represents a user, and
a link between two nodes indicates that these two users are acquaintances.
For user i, the number of acquaintances ni is a random number. It has been
found that many human networks are small-world scale-free networks, with ni
typically following a power-law distribution [5]:

−γ
p(ni) ∼ n
i

,

(6)

where p(ni) is the probability that user i has ni acquaintances and γ > 0 is
the characteristic exponent. Figure 3 shows a power-law distribution of ni in a
small-world and scale-free user network. We clearly see that a relatively small
number of users have a large number of acquaintances. We call these users
“super users” who are responsible for a large portion of the network traﬃc.
In a study of long distance call traﬃc by Aiello et al. [11], the incoming and
outgoing connections were found to follow a power-law distribution, similar
to (6), and the exponents γin = γout was about 2.1. This clearly suggests that

users do not contribute equally to the network traﬃc. In the following section,
we will study this eﬀect in detail.

4 Simulation results

We consider a telephone network of N users. Users are located in M sub-
networks, each supporting N/M users.The use of subsystems is to reﬂect the
actual case in modern telephone systems. In a ﬁxed telephone system, the
subsystems are the central oﬃces; in a cellular mobile system, the subsystems
are referred to as cells. Here, for simplicity, we assume that users remain in

7

their subnetworks for the entire period of simulation. 1 Two user network con-
ﬁgurations, namely, the fully-connected network and scale-free network, are
considered.

In a fully-connected user network, each user can call any other user with equal
probability. The eﬀect of each user is assumed to be identical. Thus, each user
has the same average arrival rate, i.e., µi = µ and λi = λ for all i. In this way,
the classical traﬃc analysis ignores the eﬀect of user network behavior on the
traﬃc.

In a scale-free user network, each user has his own acquaintance list. A user
can only call his own acquaintances. The following two-step method is used to
construct the scale-free user network. First, the number of acquaintances ni
for user i is determined by a power-law distributed random number generator.
In other words, the size of the acquaintance list for each user is ﬁxed in this
step. Next, the acquaintance lists are ﬁlled by randomly selecting acquain-
tances. The relationship of acquaintance is bi-directed. If user i is selected as
an acquaintance of user j, then user j is automatically added into user i’s
acquaintance list. When a user is going to make a call, he randomly chooses
a receiver from his acquaintance list.

As mentioned before, the probability that a user with more acquaintances
makes/receives a call is higher. Then, the mean value of this user’s inter-call
time is smaller. In order to show this inequality, we assume

µi = p0ni,

(7)

where p0 is a constant of proportionality.

The simulation parameters are set as follows:

N = 10000, M = 4, n = average ni = 5,
p0 = 1/500 call/min/acquaintance,
tm = 4 min,
µ = p0n = 0.01 call/min.

To ensure a fair comparison, we set µ = 0.01 call/min. for the fully-connected
user network. By setting these parameters, the user behavior is ﬁxed.

Figure 4 shows the blocking probability versus the channel capacity. 2 As
discussed in Section 2, call blockings are controlled by two factors, i.e., user

1 In the case of mobile networks, the traﬃc behavior may be further complicated
by the dynamics of users moving from one subnetwork to another at diﬀerent times.
2 Here the channel capacity is actually the number of channels provided in each
subnetwork.

engagement and limited channel capacity. The eﬀect of these two factors are
clearly shown in Fig. 4. When the channel capacity is very limited, almost
all call arrivals are blocked. As the channel capacity increases, some of the
arrived calls are successfully set up. The call blocking probability drops. The
larger the channel capacity is, the lower the blocking probability is. However,
as the capacity reaches a certain threshold, the blocking probability settles to
a constant value. This clearly shows that when the channel capacity is beyond
the threshold, channel capacity is no longer a factor for call blockings and user
engagement becomes the only limiting factor. Further, the channel capacity
threshold is related to the user network conﬁguration. Our simulation (for
the chosen set of parameters) shows that the capacity threshold for the fully-
connected user network is about 210 channels per subnetwork, and is only
about 100 channels per subnetwork for the scale-free user network. Moreover,
the blocking probability for the scale-free user network settles to about 44%,
and is much higher than that for the fully-connected user network, which is
about 7%. The generally higher blocking probability for the scale-free user
network is caused by call concentration on a small number of users who have
a relatively large number of acquaintances.

Figure 5 shows the actual call arrival rate versus the channel capacity. From
this ﬁgure, we can make two main observations. First, the threshold eﬀect
exists in both user network conﬁgurations. Before the capacity reaches the
threshold, the call arrival rate decreases as network capacity increases. When
the channel capacity reaches the threshold, the call arrival rate is almost ﬁxed.
The small ﬂuctuations in the resulting curves are due to the randomness of
call processes in our simulation. Second, noticeable diﬀerences between the
simulation results of the two user networks are found. The call arrival rate
for the scale-free user network declines more rapidly than that for the fully-
connected user network. Furthermore, the thresholds for the two user networks

are diﬀerent, and the call arrival rates beyond the corresponding thresholds
are also diﬀerent. For the fully-connected user network, the call arrival rate is
between 23 and 24 call/min after the threshold is reached. For the scale-free
user network, the call arrival rate is between 16 and 17 call/min after the
threshold is reached.

The decrease of the call arrival rate as channel capacity increases is due to the
complex calling processes. As discussed in Section 2, there are three typical
calling processes. The average inter-arrival times in the three cases are dif-
ferent. The shortest inter-arrival time happens in Case II. The actual calling
process is the combination of the three typical calling processes. When the
channel capacity is low, the channels are more likely to be fully occupied and
Case II (i.e., call blocking) is more likely to occur. The average inter-arrival

10

time is thus shorter, and the average arrival rate is higher. As the channel ca-
pacity increases, the blocking probability drops. Thus, the average inter-arrival
time becomes longer, making the average arrival rate lower. When the channel
capacity reaches the threshold, the blocking probability becomes steady, and
the average call arrival rate remains almost unchanged.

The resulting carried traﬃc intensities are shown in Fig. 6. The carried traﬃc
intensity is a function of the call arrival rate and blocking probability, as
in (5). Hence, when a drop in call arrival rate is “over-compensated” by a
reduction in blocking probability, the net eﬀect is an increase in carried traﬃc
intensity. This phenomenon occurs when the channel capacity is increased
initially. As the channel capacity is increased beyond the threshold, both the
call arrival rate and the blocking probability arrive at constant values, and the
corresponding carried traﬃc intensity also becomes steady. From the Fig. 6, it
can be observed that when the channel capacity is higher than 100 channels,
the carried traﬃc intensity for the scale-free user network stays at about 75
erlangs. When the channel capacity is beyond 210 channels, the carried traﬃc
intensity for the fully-connected user network remains at about 175 erlangs.

The simulated results may seem to deviate from our usual expectation. The
normal way to avoid call blockings is to increase the network capacity. But
our simulation results show that in addition to inadequate channel capacity,
the user network conﬁguration has a profound inﬂuence on call blockings. In-
creasing the network capacity may not solve the problem. The user network
conﬁguration must be considered when making telephone network planning.
Our simulation also shows that the traﬃc for the scale-free user network diﬀers
signiﬁcantly from that for the fully-connected user network, which is usually
assumed in classical traﬃc analyses. For example, the channel capacity thresh-
old for the fully-connected user network is about 210 channels, whereas the
threshold for the scale-free user network is only about 100 channels. Because
of the scale-free nature of human networks, analyses based on a scale-free user
network should reﬂect more realistic traﬃc scenarios.

5 Eﬀects of varying network parameters

Varying network parameters may inﬂuence the traﬃc load in a telephone
system. In this section, we study the eﬀects of three important parameters,
namely, the average holding time tm, proportionality constant p0 and the aver-
age number of acquaintances n. In order to focus on the eﬀects of the network
parameters, we eliminate the eﬀects of the channel capacity by temporarily
setting it to inﬁnity. For the fully-connected network, each user can call any
other user. For a fair comparison between the fully-connected user network
and the scale-free user network, the same set of average inter-call time (1/µ)

that by increasing tm, the call arrival rate decreases. This can be reasoned
as follows. For the usual Case I, since the inter-arrival time is the sum of
the holding time and the inter-call time, the inter-arrival time increases as tm
increases and hence the call arrival rate decreases. Also, as tm increases, Case
III of the calling process occurs with a higher probability, meaning that more

(c)

call attempts are cancelled without being counted as a call arrival. The inter-
arrival time will then increase, reducing the call arrival rate. Fig. 7 (b) plots
the blocking probability versus tm. With a larger tm, each call lasts longer.
Hence, when an incoming call arrives, the probability that it will be blocked is
higher. Thus, the blocking probability increases with tm. Figure 7 (c) plots the
carried traﬃc intensity versus tm. Although there is a drop in the average call
arrival rate and an increase in the blocking probability with tm, the carried
traﬃc intensity still grows because the increase in the average call duration
“over-compensates” the aforementioned two eﬀects.

In the second set of simulations, we vary the proportionality constant p0 in the
scale-free user network. Correspondingly, the value of µ in the fully-connected
network changes according to µ = 5p0 to maintain the same average inter-
call time (1/µ) in both networks. Figure 8 shows the eﬀect of changing p0
(and hence µ in the case of the fully-connected network). For a larger p0, the
probability of initiating a call from any user is higher. The call arrival rate
thus increases and consequently the blocking probability increases. Comparing
the fully-connected user network with the scale-free user network, the carried
traﬃc intensity for the scale-free user network grows much slower than that
for the fully-connected user network because of the slow increase in the call
arrival rate and rapid increase in the blocking probability.

Finally, the eﬀect of varying the average number of acquaintances n is shown
in Fig. 9. For the scale-free user network, we adjust this parameter by chang-
ing γ of the power-law distribution. As shown in (6), a smaller γ corresponds
to a gentler slope of the power-law distribution, which means that more users
have a large number of acquaintances. Hence, n increases as γ decreases. Cor-
respondingly, in the fully-connected user network, we change the value of µ
according to µ = n/500 to maintain the same average inter-call time (1/µ) in
both user networks.

As shown in (7), calls arrive more frequently when n (and µ) increases. Thus,
the average call arrival rate is found to increase with n, as shown in Fig. 9 (a).
The increase in call arrivals causes an increase in the blocking probability, as
shown in Fig. 9 (b). In Fig. 9 (c), the carried traﬃc intensity is plotted versus
the average number of acquaintances. For the fully-connected user network,
the increase in the call arrival rate “overshadows” the increase in the blocking
probability, causing a net rise in the carried traﬃc intensity. For the scale-free
user network, the eﬀect of an increase in the call arrival rate is “balanced out”
by an increase in the blocking probability, causing no apparent change in the
carried traﬃc intensity.

As a ﬁnal and general remark, compared with the telephone system with a
fully-connected user network, the system with a scale-free user network has
a lower average call arrival rate, a (much) higher blocking probability, and a

6 Conclusions

This paper studies the telephone network traﬃc from a scale-free user net-
work perspective. Two major factors, namely, the channel capacity and user
network conﬁguration, are identiﬁed as being pivotal to call blockings. Our
simulation results show that the network traﬃc assuming a scale-free user
network diﬀers substantially from the traﬃc assuming a conventional fully-
connected user network. For the scale-free user network, the traﬃc load arises
mainly from a small number of users who have a relatively large number of
acquaintances. This concentration causes a higher blocking probability. At the
same time, the majority of users, who have a few acquaintances, contribute
much less to the traﬃc load. In this paper we have also studied the eﬀects
of diﬀerent network parameters on the calling process. Our ﬁnal conclusions
are that telephone network traﬃc is greatly inﬂuenced by user behavior, and
that beyond a certain capacity threshold call blockings are not likely to be
reduced by increasing network capacity (adding extra resources or intensify-
ing investments) which would have been the usual expectation. Thus, a clear,
though obvious, lesson to be learnt from this traﬃc analysis is that any strat-
egy for altering the traﬃc in any manner must take into account the scale-free
property of user networks.

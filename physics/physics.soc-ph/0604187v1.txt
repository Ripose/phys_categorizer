We study geographical effects on the spread of diseases in lattice-embedded scale-free networks. The ge-
ographical structure is represented by the connecting probability of two nodes that is related to the Euclidean
distance between them in the lattice. By studying the standard Susceptible-Infected model, we found that the
geographical structure has great inﬂuences on the temporal behavior of epidemic outbreaks and the propagation
in the underlying network: the more geographically constrained the network is, the more smoothly the epidemic
spreads.

The classical mathematical approach to disease spreading
either ignores the population structure or treats populations
as distributed in a regular medium [1]. However, it has been
suggested recently that many social, biological, and commu-
nication systems possess two universal characters, the small-
world effect [2] and the scale-free property [3], which can be
described by complex networks whose nodes represent indi-
viduals and links represent the interactions among them [4].
In view of the wide occurrence of complex networks in na-
ture, it is important to study the effects of topological struc-
tures on the dynamics of epidemic spreading. Pioneering
works [5, 6, 7, 8, 9] have given some valuable insights of
that: for small-world networks, there are critical thresholds
below which infectious diseases will eventually die out; on
the contrary, even infections with low spreading rates will pre-
vail over the entire population in scale-free networks, which
radically changes many of the conclusions drawn in classic
epidemic modelling. Furthermore, it was observed that the
heterogeneity of a population network in which the epidemic
spreads may have noticeable effects on the evolution of the
epidemic as well as the corresponding immunization strate-
gies [8, 9, 10, 11].

In many real systems, however, individuals are often em-
bedded in a Euclidean geographical space and the interactions
among them usually depend on their spatial distances [12].
Also, it has been proved that the characteristic distance plays
a crucial role in the phenomena taking place in the system
[13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. Thus, it is natural to study complex net-
works with geographical properties. Rozenfeld et al. con-
sidered that the spatial distance can affect the connection be-
tween nodes and proposed a lattice-embedded scale-free net-
work (LESFN) model [13] to account for geographical effects.
Based on a natural principle of minimizing the total length of
links in the system, the scale-free networks can be embed-
ded in a Euclidean space without additional external expo-
nents. Since distributions of individuals in social networks
are always dependent on their spatial locations, the inﬂuence
of geographical structures on epidemic spreading is of high
importance, but up to now it has rarely been studied.

N = 10000, γ = 2.5, and for different values of A. The territory
parameter A controls the inﬂuence of the geographical distance on
the network structure.

In the present work, we study the standard Susceptible-
Infected (SI) model on the LESFNs, trying to understand how
the geographical structure affects the dynamical process of
epidemic spreading. Especially, we consider the temporal
behavior of epidemic outbreaks and the propagation in the
underlying network. It is found that the geographical struc-
ture plays an important role in the epidemic outbreaks and the
propagation of diseases.

According to Ref. [13], the LESFN is generated as follows:
(i) a lattice of size N = L
L with periodic boundary condi-
tions is assumed, upon which the network will be embedded;
(ii) for each site, a preset degree k is assigned taken from the
k−γ, m < k < K; (iii) a node
scale-free distribution, P (k)
∼
(say i, with degree ki) is picked out randomly and connected
to its closest neighbors until its degree quotum ki is realized
or until all sites up to a distance, r(ki) = A√ki, have been
explored. Duplicate connections are avoided. Here, r(ki) is
the spatial distance on a Euclidean plane, denoting the charac-
teristic radius of the region that node i can almost freely con-
nect to the others; (iv) this process is repeated throughout all

upon the change of the territory parameter A. Especially, the

In order to study the dynamical evolution of epidemic out-
breaks, we focus on the standard SI model [1]. In this model,
individuals have only two discrete states:
susceptible (or
healthy) and infected. Each individual is represented by a ver-
tex of the network and the links are the connections between
individuals along which the infection may spread. There are
initially a number of I0 infected nodes and any infected node
can pass the disease to its susceptible neighbors at a spread-
ing rate λ. Once a susceptible node is infected, it remains in
this state. The total population (the size of the network) N

is assumed to be constant and, if S(t) and I(t) are the num-
bers of susceptible and infected individuals at time t, respec-
tively, then N = S(t) + I(t). In spite of its simplicity, the SI
model is a good approximation for studying the early dynam-
ics of epidemic outbreaks [1, 11] and assessing the effects of
the underlying topologies on the spreading dynamics [17, 19].
We have performed Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations of the SI
model with synchronously updating on the LESFNs. With
relevance to empirical evidence that many networks are char-
acterized by a power-low distribution with 2 < γ < 3 [4],
we set γ = 2.5 in the present work. Initially, we select one
node randomly and assume it is infected. The disease will
spread throughout the network and the dynamical process is
controlled by the topology of the underlying network.

In Fig. 2, we report the temporal behavior of outbreaks
in the LESFNs. The density of infected individuals, ρ(t) (=
I(t)/N ), is computed over 500 realizations of the dynamics.
Consistent with the deﬁnition of the model, all the individuals
will be infected in the long-time limit, i.e., limt→∞ ρ(t) = 1,
since infected individuals remain unchanged during the evo-
lution. In Fig. 2(a), for the given connecting region (A = 9),
the greater the spreading rate λ is, the more quickly the in-
fection spreads. Fig. 2(b) shows the dependence of the infec-
tious prevalence ρ(t) on the territory parameter A, while the

spreading rate is ﬁxed at λ = 0.001. As A increases from 1 to
9, the average spatial length of edges increases [13]; namely,
the nodes have larger probabilities to connect to more other
nodes, which therefore leads to a faster spread of the infec-
tion.

To better understand the virus propagation in the popula-
tion, we study in detail the spreading velocity, written as [20]

We count the number of newly infected nodes at each time
step and report the spreading velocity in Fig. 3. Apparently,
the spreading velocity goes up to a peak quickly and leaves
very short response time for us to develop control measures.
Before the outbreaks of the infection, the number of infected
individuals is very small, lasting for a very long time during
the outbreak, and the number of susceptible individuals is very
small. Thus, when t is very small (or very large), the spread-
ing velocity is close to zero. In the case of A = 9 (Fig. 3(a)),
all plots show an exponential decay in the long-time propaga-
tion. These results are weakened for a small circular connect-
ing probability (in particular, for A = 1), as shown in Fig.
3(b), where the disease spreads in a relatively low velocity,
which therefore slows down the outbreaks.

A more precise characterization of the epidemic diffusion
through such a network can be achieved by studying the av-
erage degree of the newly infected individuals at time t [11],

where Ik(t) is the number of infected nodes with degree k.
In Fig. 4, we plot the temporal behavior of kinf (t) for the

SI model with λ = 0.001 in the LESFNs. Different from
the clearly hierarchical dynamics in Barab´asi-Albert scale-
free networks [11], in which the infection pervades the net-
works in a progressive cascade across smaller-degree classes,
epidemic spreads slowly from higher- to lower-degree classes
in the LESFNs. The smaller the territory parameter A is, the
more smoothly the infection propagates. Especially, strong
global oscillations arise in the initial time region, which im-
plies that the geographical structure plays an important role in
early epidemic spreading, independent of the degrees of the
infected nodes.

The intrinsic stochasticity of the epidemic spreading makes
each realization unique [17, 21], therefore it is valuable to an-
alyze the statistical ﬂuctuations around the average behavior
for assessing simulation results with respect to real outbreaks.
We measure the variance of the prevalence, deﬁned by

V ar(ρ(t)) = E[(ρ(t)

(3)

2
ρ(t))

].

−

In order to evaluate this quantity, we have performed 500 in-
dependent runs with different conﬁgurations of the intrinsic
frequencies as well as different network realizations. Fig. 5
displays the time evolution of V ar(ρ(t)) for LESFNs with
different values of A. Since the initial prevalence is ﬁxed and
is the same for all instances, V ar(ρ(t)) is initially equal to
zero and can only increase. At very large time, almost all
nodes are infected, implying that limt→∞ V ar(ρ(t)) = 0.
Compared with Fig. 3(b), one can easily ﬁnd that time re-
gions in which the ﬂuctuations are maximal are the same as
that in which the spreading velocities are the fastest. More-
over, an important feature is the rough symmetry of curves,
regardless of A = 9 (more randomly scale-free) or A = 1
(more locally constrained) and the time regimes in which the
ﬂuctuations are maximal corresponding to a small diversity of
the degrees of the infected nodes. This is also different from
that in Barab´asi-Albert scale-free networks [17].

4

In conclusion, we have studied geographical effects on
the spreading phenomena in lattice-embedded scale-free net-
works, in which a territory parameter A controls the inﬂuence
of the geographical structure on the network. We have in-
vestigated the temporal behavior of epidemic outbreaks and
found that the spreading velocity reaches a peak very quickly
in the initial infection period and then decays in an approx-
imately exponential form in a more randomly scale-free re-
gion, which is consistent with previous studies. While the
networks are more graphically constrained, this feature is ap-
parently weakened. Furthermore, we have studied the propa-
gation of the infection through different degree classes in the
networks. Different from the clearly hierarchical dynamics
in which the infection pervades the networks in a progres-

sive cascade across smaller-degree classes in Barab´asi-Albert
scale-free networks, epidemic smoothly spreads from higher-
to lower-degree classes in the LESFNs. Finally, we have ana-
lyzed the prevalence ﬂuctuations around the average epidemic
process. A rough symmetry of curves is found and the time
regions in which the ﬂuctuations are maximal correspond to a
small diversity of the degrees of the infected nodes, which is
also different from that observed from Barab´asi-Albert scale-
free networks.

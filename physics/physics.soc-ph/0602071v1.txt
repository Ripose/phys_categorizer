The community structure and motif-modular-network hiberarchy are of great importance for
understanding the relationship between structures and functions. In this rapid communication, we
propose a new measure named the clique-degree, which is a generalized concept of degree and can
be used to measure the density of cliques in networks. The empirical studies indicate the extensive
existence of power-law clique-degree distributions in various real networks. By comparing with
the randomized networks, we show that the power-law clique-degree distribution is independent to
traditional scale-free property.

Recently, the discovery of small-world eﬀect [1] and
scale-free property [2] triggers oﬀ an upsurge in study-
ing the structures and functions of real-life networks
[3, 4, 5, 6]. In a network, the distance between two nodes
is deﬁned as the number of edges along the shortest path
connecting them. The average distance L of the net-
work, then, is deﬁned as the mean distance between two
nodes, averaged over all pairs of nodes. Another signiﬁ-
cant parameter C, named clustering coeﬃcient, denotes
the probability that two randomly selected neighbors of
a randomly chosen node are neighboring too. Previous
empirical studies have demonstrated that most real-life
networks are small-world[7], that is to say, it has very
small average distance like completely random networks
[8] and large clustering coeﬃcient like regular networks.
Another important characteristic in real-life networks is
the power-law degree distribution, that is p(k) ∝ k−γ,
where k is the degree and p(k) is the probability den-
sity function for the degree distribution. Networks with
power-law degree distribution are referred to as scale-free
networks, for the power function is scale-invariant.

Very recently, empirical studies reveal that many real-
life networks, especially the biological networks, are
densely made up of some functional motifs [9, 10]. The
distributing pattern of these motifs can reﬂect the over-
all structural properties thus can be used to classify
networks [11]. In addition, the networks’ functions are
highly aﬀetced by these motifs [12]. A simple and in-
tuitionistic measure can be obtained by comparing the
density of motifs between real networks and completely
random ones [11], however, this method is too rough thus
still under oppugning now [13, 14]. In this rapid commu-

The word clique in network science equals to the term
complete subgraph in graph theory [15, 16], that is to say,
the m order clique (m-clique for short) means a fully con-
nected network with m nodes and m(m+1)/2 edges. De-

2-clique is an edge, and k(2)
equals to the degree ki, thus
the concept of clique-degree can be considered as a gen-

Real-life networks can be roughly divided into 4 classes
[5]: social networks, information networks, technological
networks, and biological networks. We have calculated
the clique-degree from order 2 to 5 for some represen-
tative networks. Figure 2 to 8 exhibit 7 representative
networks, these are the Internet at Autonomous Systems
(AS) level [17], the Internet at routers level [18], the
metabolic network of P.aeruginosa [19], the world-wide

web [20], the collaboration network of mathematicians
[21], the BBS friendship networks in University of Science
and Technology of China (USTC) [22], and the protein-
protein interaction (ppi) networks of yeast[23]. The basic
topological properties for the above 7 networks are shown
in Table 1.

From Fig. 2 to 8, one can ﬁnd that although the back-
grounds of these networks are completely diﬀerent, they
share some common properties in clique-degree distribu-
tions. We have checked many examples (not shown here)
and ﬁnd almost the same features in their clique-degree
distributions. However, not all the networks can display
higher order power-law clique-degree distributions. Ac-
tually, only the relative large networks have power-law
clique-degree distribution with order higher than 2. For

FIG. 7: Clique-degree distributions of the BBS friendship net-

example, Ref.
[19] contains 43 diﬀerent metabolic net-
works, but most of them are very small (with fewer nodes
than 1000), in which the cliques with order higher than
3 are unwonted. Only the ﬁve networks with most nodes
display relatively obvious power-law clique-degree distri-
butions, and the case of P.aeruginosa is shown in Fig.
4. Furthermore, all the empirical data show that the
power-law exponent will decrease with the increase of
clique order. This may be a universal property and can
reveal some unknown underlying mechanism in network
evolution, although we have not obtained a theoretical
explanation.

In order to illuminate that the power-law clique-degree
distributions with order higher than 2 is independent to

traditional scale-free property, we compare these distri-
butions between original USTC BBS friendship network
and the corresponding randomized network. Here the
randomizing process is implemented by using the edge-
crossing algorithm [24, 25], which can keep the degree of
each node unchanged. The procedure is as follows:

(1) Randomly pick two existing edges e1 = x1x2 and
e2 = x3x4, such that x1 6= x2 6= x3 6= x4 and there is no
edge between x1 and x4 as well as x2 and x3.

(2) Interchange these two edges, that is, connect x1
and x4 as well as x2 and x3, and remove the edges e1
and e2.

(3) Repeat (1) and (2) for suﬃcient times.
Fig. 9 provides a sketch maps for this algorithm.
We call the network after this operation the random-
ized network. One can distinguish whether the topologi-
cal properties are independent to the degree distribution.
In Fig. 10, we report the clique-degree distributions in
the randomized network with order 2 to 4. Obviously, the
2-clique-degree distributions are the same as that in Fig.
7. One can ﬁnd that the randomized network does not
display power-law clique-degree distributions with higher
order, in fact, it has very few 4-cliques and none 5-cliques.

cal features of networks, but also provide useful criterions
in judging the validity of evolution models (For example,
the Barab´asi-Albert model [2] does not display high or-
der power-law clique-degree distributions.). The clique-
degree, which can be considered as a generalized concept
of degree, may be useful in measuring the density of mo-
tifs, such subunits not only plays a role in controlling the
dynamic behaviors, but also refers the basic evolutionary
characteristics. More interesting, we ﬁnd various real-life
networks display power-law clique-degree distributions of
decreasing exponent with the clique order. The present
ﬁndings a new statistical property independent to scale-
free property, which can provide a criterion in the stud-
ies of modelling. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that the dynam-
ics on network, such as synchronization, traﬃc, epidemic
spread, and so on, are highly aﬀected by the patterns of
clique-degree distributions, which will be published else-
where.

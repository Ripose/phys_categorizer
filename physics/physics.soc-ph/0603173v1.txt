Abstract
The daily volume of transaction on the New York Stock Exchange and its
day-to-day ﬂuctuations are analysed with respect to power-law tails as well
long-term trends. We also model the transition to a Gaussian distribution
for longer time intervals, like months instead of days.

Keywords: Fat tails, normal distribution, Pareto distribution.
PACS numbers: 89.65.Gh

1 Introduction

The statistical analysis of stock market ﬂuctuations has a long tradition, in
economics [1] as well as physics [2]. It is widely accepted that the probability
distribution function for relative price changes is neither a Gaussian nor a
L´evy distribution but has power-law or ”fat” tails. Thus the probability
P>(r) for the relative price change (more precisely for the change r in the
logarithm of the price) to be larger than r decays roughly as

P>(r) ∝ 1/r3, P (r) ∝ 1/r4

where P (r) is the direct distribution, not the cumulative one.

Besides the price x also the volume V and the number of transactions T

(both per day) is of interest [3], related through

(2)

Here we are interested in daily closures and not in price changes during the
trading day, and assume that one stock is followed which does not split into
diﬀerent companies, merge with other companies, or loses its identity for
other reasons. For market indices like the Dow Jones (DJIA), and changing

V = xT .

its composition over the years, we simply deﬁne T as the ratio V /x. Our V
is measured in dollars per day, or more generally in local currency units (lcu)
per day.

In the next section we compare the long-time trends in x, V and T for the
DJIA as well as for International Business Machines. Section 3 looks at the
probability distribution functions for V and T and also for their daily changes,
analogously to the well-known return distributions of Eq.(1). Section 4 oﬀer
a simple model to explain why the distribution of monthly returns deviates
from Eq(1) and gets closer to a Gaussian [4, 5].

2 Long-time trends

For the DJIA [6] we see in Fig.1 that the price x(t) showed lot of diﬀerent
behaviour since 1940 [7], while the volume V (t) increased roughly exponen-
tially. However, the ﬂuctuations in V were quite strong in 1940 at the end of
the Great Recession, and also in recent months. Perhaps these recent ﬂuc-
tuations signal a transition to a diﬀerent regime, to be seen in the coming
years. The data for T (t) show more coupling with the price x: In the last
half century, exponential increase in x corresponded to a ﬂat T (t) while a
ﬂat x was accompanied by an exponentially increasing T .

The exponential increase for V (t) is seen for the daily volume, the weekly
volume, and the monthly volume, with the two latter quantities summing
(not averaging) over the trading days in that time interval. However, the
large ﬂuctuations in V (t) in 1940 and now are seen clearer for the monthly
than the weekly or daily volumes and thus are shown in Fig.1a,b. Similar
results (not shown) were obtained for the NASDAQ and S & P 500 indices
during the more recent decades.

Analogous data for the single company IBM instead of the index DJIA are
shown in Fig.2a,b, and here the above observations for T cannot be repeated.
Instead a price increase twice corresponded to a falling T .

3 Distributions

The distributions of the daily volumes and transactions would not be the
analog of the return distributions in Eq.(1) since the returns are the price
changes. Thus we look in Fig.3 at the changes from one day to the next,

V (t) − V (t − 1) and T (t) − T (t − 1) for DJIA and IBM. We see no good power
laws; instead an exponential or Gaussian distribution ﬁts the data better
overall. This conclusion should be regarded as preliminary; it is possible
that more accurate data over a larger number of decades [2] would give a
diﬀerent result.

Thus within the limits of our statistics the probability distribution func-
tions for volumes and their changes do not show the fat tails known from the
price ﬂuctuations.

4 Crossover

The above discrepancy between price and volume ﬂuctuations shows up if we
look at daily changes or even shorter times [2, 1]. If instead we look at price
changes from one month to the other, a crossover towards a more Gaussian
distribution of returns r is found [4]. We now oﬀer a simple model to explain
this crossover from the power-law of Eq.(1) to a Gaussian behavior,

ln[P (r)/P (0)] ∝ −r2

.

(3)

We assume that the power law comes from intrinsic market behaviour, like
herding [5, 4], while the Gaussian ﬂuctuations come from outside economic

or political facts like inventions, wars, . . . [8]. For short times, few outside
disturbances happen and the power-law prevails; in longer time intervals more
outside events inﬂuence the prices, and if these outside events are random,
they accumulate to a Gaussian inﬂuence.

As a quantitative model, we simulated a return distribution P (r) ∝ 1/r4
with integer r; one unit in r may correspond to a few tenths of a percent.
(Each r is rounded from ±z−1/3 where z is taken randomly between 0 and
1.) Then each r produced in this random way is modiﬁed by m consecutive
additions of +1, −1 and zero, with probabilities 1/4, 1/4, and 1/2, respec-
tively. The case m = 0 is not shown and corresponds to Eq.(1); the cases

for large m in a superposition of Pareto power and random noise. m =
1(+), 10(×) and 100(stars).

m = 1, 10, 100 are shown in Fig.4 from 108 samples. We see that m = 1
barely diﬀers from the power law, while for m = 10 we see a Gaussian in the
center and the power law in the tails. For m = 100 nearly the whole range
follows a Gaussian, and the fat tails are so small that they would be visible
only in high-quality statistics of real markets. Asymptotically, however, the
tails should always follow the power law.

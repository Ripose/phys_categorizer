Abstract

We analyze the hitting time distributions of stock price returns in diﬀerent time windows, char-

acterized by diﬀerent levels of noise present in the market. The study has been performed on two

sets of data from US markets. The ﬁrst one is composed by daily price of 1071 stocks trade for the

12-year period 1987-1998, the second one is composed by high frequency data for 100 stocks for

the 4-year period 1995-1998. We compare the probability distribution obtained by our empirical

analysis with those obtained from diﬀerent models for stock market evolution. Speciﬁcally by fo-

cusing on the statistical properties of the hitting times to reach a barrier or a given threshold, we

compare the probability density function (PDF) of three models, namely the geometric Brownian

motion, the GARCH model and the Heston model with that obtained from real market data. We

will present also some results of a generalized Heston model.

INTRODUCTION

The interest of physicists in intedisciplinary researches has been largely increased in re-

cent years and one of the developing ﬁeld in this context is econophysics. It applies and

proposes ideas, methods and models in statistical physics and physics of complex systems to

analyze data coming from economical phenomena [1]. Several statistical properties veriﬁed

in ﬁnancial quantities such as relative price changes or returns and their standard deviation,

have enabled the establishment of new models which characterize systems ever better [2].

Moreover the formalism used by physicists to analyze and to model complex systems consti-

tutes a speciﬁc contribution that physics gives to many other ﬁelds. Complex systems in fact

provide a very good paradigm for all those systems, physical and non-physical ones, whose

dynamics is driven by the nonlinear interaction of many agents in the presence of ”natural ”

randomness [3]. The simplest universal feature of ﬁnancial time series, discovered by Bache-

lier [4], is the linear growth of the variance of the return ﬂuctuations with time scale, by

considering the relative price changes uncorrelated. The availability of high frequency data

and deeper statistical analyses invalidated this ﬁrst approximated model [2], which is not

adequate to catch also other important statistical peculiarities of ﬁnancial markets, namely:

(i) the non-Gaussian distribution of returns, (ii) the intermittent and correlated nature of

return amplitudes, and (iii) the multifractal scaling [5], that is the anomalous scaling of

higher moments of price changes with time.

In this paper we focus our attention on the statistical properties of the ﬁrst hitting

time (FHT), which refers to the time to achieve a given ﬁxed return or a given threshold

for prices. Theoretical and empirical investigations have been done recently on the mean

exit time (MET) [6] and on the waiting times [7] of ﬁnancial time series. We use also the

term ”escape time” to include the analysis of times between diﬀerent dynamical regimes

in ﬁnancial markets done in a generalized Heston model [8]. Markets indeed present days

of normal activity and extreme days where high price variations are observed, like crash

days. To describe these events, a nonlinear Langevin market model has been proposed in

Refs. [9], where diﬀerent regimes are modelled by means of an eﬀective metastable potential

for price returns with a potential barrier. We will discuss three diﬀerent market models

evidencing their limits and features, by comparing the PDF of hitting times of these models

with those obtained from real ﬁnancial time series. Moreover we will present some recent

results obtained using a generalized Heston model.

II. MODELS FOR STOCK MARKET EVOLUTION

A. The geometric random walk

The most widespread and simple market model is that proposed by Black and Scholes to

address quantitatively the problem of option pricing [10]. The model assumes that the price

obeys the following multiplicative stochastic diﬀerential equation

d p(t) = µ

p(t)

dt + σ

p(t)

dW (t)

·

·

·

·

where µ and σ are the expected average growth for the price and the expected noise intensity

(the volatility) in the market dynamics respectively. dp/p is usually called price return. The

model is a geometric random walk with drift µ and diﬀusion σ. By applying the Ito’s lemma

we obtain for the logarithm of the price

d lnp(t) = (µ

)

dt + σ

dW (t) .

·

·

This model catches one of the more important stylized facts of ﬁnancial markets, that is the

short range correlation for price returns. This characteristic is necessary in order to warrant

market eﬃciency. Short range correlation indeed yields unpredictability in the price time

series and makes it diﬃcult to set up arbitrage strategies.

The statistical properties of escape times τ for this process are well known, and the PDF

of escape time τ , F (τ, p0), was obtained analytically [11]. If the starting value of the price

is p0 at time t = 0, the distribution of the time τ to reach a barrier at position h is given by

the so called inverse Gaussian

which is well known among ﬁnance practitioners to price exotic options like barrier op-

tions [11] or to evaluate the probability for a ﬁrm to reach the zero value where it will

remain forever. The shape of the distribution is shown in Fig. 1 for two diﬀerent cases. The

asymptotic expressions of PDF show in one case a power law tail with exponent -1.5

The distribution of hitting times for price returns instead is very simple. In the geometric

Brownian motion the returns are independent, so the probability to observe a value after a

certain barrier is given by the probability that the ”particle” doesn’t escape after n

where p is the probability to observe a return inside the region deﬁned by the barrier, ∆t

is the observation time step and τ is the escape time. So the probability is exponential

in time. The geometric Brownian motion is not adequate to describe ﬁnancial markets

behavior, because the volatility is considered as a constant parameter and the PDF of the

price is a log-normal distribution.

B. The GARCH and the Heston models

Price returns have indeed properties that cannot be reproduced by the previous simple

model: (i) price return distribution has fat tails; (ii) price returns have short range correlation

but the volatility is a stochastic process with long range correlation [12]. The degree of

variability in time of the volatility indeed depends not only on the Fundamentals of the

ﬁrm but also on the market conditions. Volatility is usually higher during crisis periods

and has also an almost deterministic intra-day pattern during the trading day, being higher

4

near market opening and closure. So the volatility can be considered as a stochastic process

itself and it is characterized by long range memory and clustering. More realistic models to

reproduce the dynamics of the volatility have been developed. Here we will present two of

them: the GARCH and the Heston models.

The GARCH(p,q) process (generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity),

which is essentially a random multiplicative process, is the generalization of the ARCH

process and combines linearly the actual return with p previous values of the variance and

q previous values of the square return [13]. The process is described by the equations

(7)

where αi and βi are parameters that can be estimated by means of a best ﬁt of real market

data, xt is a stochastic process representing price returns and is characterized by a standard

deviation σt. The GARCH process has a non-constant conditional variance but the variance

observed on long time period, called unconditional variance, is instead constant and can

be calculated as a function of the model parameters. It has been demonstrated that x2

t of

GARCH(1,1) is a Markovian process with exponential autocorrelation, while the autoco-

variance of GARCH(p,q) model is a linear combination of exponential functions [2, 13]. We

will consider the simpler GARCH(1,1) model

t = α0 + (α1η2

xt = ηt ·

σt .

(8)

The autocorrelation function of the process xt is proportional to a delta function, while

t has a correlation characteristic time equal to τ =

unconditional variance equal to σ2 = α0/(1

β1). So it is possible to ﬁt the empirical

−
values of these two quantities by adjusting few parameters. Speciﬁcally α1 and β1 regulate

α1 −

the characteristic time scale in the correlation, while α0 can be adjusted independently to

ﬁt the observed unconditional variance.

In the Heston model [14] the dynamics is described by a geometric Brownian motion

coupled to a second stochastic process for the variable v = σ2. The model equations are

for v is called Cox-Ingersoll-Ross [16] and has the following features: (i) the deterministic

solution tends exponentially to the level b at a rate a (mean reverting process); (ii) the
autocorrelation is exponential with time scale τ = a−1. Here c is the amplitude of volatility

ﬂuctuations often called the volatility of volatility. Once again we have a model with short

range correlation that mimics the eﬀective long range correlation of the markets using large

values of τ . The process is multiplicative and values of v can be ampliﬁed in few steps

producing bursts of volatility. If the characteristic time is large enough, many steps will be

required to revert the process to the mean level b. So the longer the memory is, the longer

the burst will survive. For little correlation times the process ﬂuctuates uniformly around

the mean level b, whereas for large correlation times v presents an intermittent behavior with

alternating activity of burst and calm periods. The model has been recently investigated by

econophysicists [15] and solved analytically [17].

The two models presented so far are a more realistic representation of ﬁnancial market

than the simple geometric Brownian motion, even if they do not reproduce quantitatively

the form of the long time correlation observed for the volatility. We use a set of 1071 daily

stock price returns for the 12-year period 1987-1998, and we compare the results obtained by

simulation of the GARCH and Heston models with those obtained from real market data.

The parameters in the models were chosen by means of a best ﬁt, in order to reproduce

the correlation properties and the variance appropriate for real market. Speciﬁcally for the

GARCH model we used values α1 = 0.07906 and β1 = 0.90501 obtained elsewhere [18] to
10−6 in order to ﬁt the average

ﬁt the correlation time of daily market data, and α0 = 7.7

10−5 and
10−3,

10−4, obtained in a recent work [17], suitable for daily returns and c = 10.3

10−2, b = 8.62

µ = 5.67

·

·

·

·

as before, to ﬁt the average standard deviation of our data set. Using these parameters we

obtain distribution for price returns that are in reasonable agreement with real market data,

as shown in Fig. 2. The two models approximate the return distributions of real data better

than the Gaussian curve. In particular the Heston model gives the best agreement. The

chosen parameter set therefore is good enough to ﬁt the dynamics of our data.

In order to investigate the statistical properties of escape times τ we choose two thresholds

to deﬁne the start and the end for the random walk. Speciﬁcally we calculate the standard

deviation σi, with i = 1, . . . , 1071 for each stock over the whole 12-year period. Then we set

are diﬀerent for each stock, the ﬁnal threshold is considered as an absorbing barrier. The

resulting experimental distribution reported in Fig. 3 has an exponential tail but it deviates

from the exponential behavior in the region of low escape times. Speciﬁcally low escape times

have probability higher than the exponential. We recall that for the geometric Brownian

motion model this distribution should be exponential over the entire τ axis. So the ﬁrst

conclusion we can draw from our analysis is that the basic geometric Brownian motion is

not adequate to explain the distribution of τ .

In order to reproduce more closely the situation present in real market we choose σstart

only once, speciﬁcally we place the random walker in the initial starting position and we

set the initial volatility value. When the random walker hits the barrier, we register the

time and we place the walker again in the initial position, using the volatility of the barrier

hitting time. So the random walker can experience diﬀerent initial volatility values as in

real markets. The results are reported in the two panels of Fig. 3 for both the GARCH and

the Heston models, and we see that these models provide a better agreement with real data

than the geometric Brownian motion. Moreover for the GARCH model the agreement is only

qualitative, whereas the Heston model is able to ﬁt the empirical distribution quantitatively.

C. The modiﬁed Heston model

Here we consider a generalization of the Heston model, by considering a cubic nonlinear-

ity. This generalization represents a ﬁctitious ”Brownian particle” moving in an eﬀective

potential with a metastable state, in order to model those systems with two diﬀerent dynam-

ical regimes like ﬁnancial markets in normal activity and extreme days [9]. The equations

of the new model are

where U(x) = 2x3 + 3x2 is the eﬀective cubic potential with a metastable state at xme = 0, a

maximum at xM =

1, and a cross point between the potential and the x axes at xI =

1.5.

−

In systems with a metastable state like this, the noise can originate the noise enhanced

stability (NES) phenomenon, an interesting eﬀect that increases, instead of decreasing, the

stability by enhancing the lifetime of the metastable state [19, 20]. The mean escape time τ

for a Brownian particle moving throughout a barrier ∆U, with a noise intensity v, is given

by the the well known exponential Kramers law τ = exp [∆U/v], where τ is a monotonically

decreasing function of the noise intensity v. This is true only if the random walk starts

8

(10)

(11)

−

from initial positions inside the potential well. When the starting position is chosen in

the instability region xo < xM , τ exhibits an enhancement behavior, with respect to the

deterministic escape time, as a function of v. This is the NES eﬀect and it can be explained

considering the barrier ”seen” by the Brownian particle starting at the initial position x0,

that is ∆Uin = U(xmax)

U(x0). In fact ∆Uin is smaller than ∆U as long as the starting

−

position x0 lies in the interval I = [xI , xM ]. Therefore for a Brownian particle starting

from an unstable initial position, from a probabilistic point of view, it is easier to enter into

the well than to escape from, once the particle is entered. So a small amount of noise can

increase the lifetime of the metastable state. For a detailed discussion on this point and

diﬀerent dynamical regimes see Refs. [20]. When the noise intensity v is much greater than

∆U, the Kramers behavior is recovered.

Here, by considering the modiﬁed Heston model, characterized by a stochastic volatility

and a nonlinear Langevin equation for the returns, we study the mean escape time as a

function of the model parameters a, b and c.

In particular we investigate whether it is

possible to observe some kind of nonmonotonic behavior such that observed for τ vs. v in

the NES eﬀect with constant volatility v. We call the enhancement of the mean escape

time (MET) τ , with a nonmonotonic behavior as a function of the model parameters, NES

eﬀect in the broad sense. Our modiﬁed Heston model has two limit regimes, corresponding

to the cases a = 0, with only the noise term in the equation for the volatility v(t), and

c = 0 with only the reverting term in the same equation. This last case corresponds to the

usual parametric constant volatility regime. In fact, apart from an exponential transient,

the volatility reaches the asymptotic value b, and the NES eﬀect is observable as a function

of b. To this purpose we perform simulations by integrating numerically the equations (10)

and (11) using a time step ∆t = 0.01. The simulations were performed placing the walker

in the initial positions x0 located in the unstable region [xI, xM ] and using an absorbing

barrier at x =

6.0. When the walker hits the barrier, the escape time is registered and

−

another simulation is started, placing the walker at the same starting position x0, but using

the volatility value of the barrier hitting time.

The mean escape time as a function of b is plotted in Fig. 4 for the 3 diﬀerent starting

unstable positions and for c = 0. The curves are averaged over 105 escape events. The non-

monotonic behavior is present. After the maximum, when the values of b are much greater

than the potential barrier height, the Kramers behavior is recovered. The nonmonotonic

9

term is present: a = 10−2, c = 0).

behavior is more evident for starting positions near the maximum of the potential. For a = 0

the system is too noisy and the NES eﬀect is not observable as a function of parameter c.

The presence of the reverting term therefore aﬀects the behavior of τ in the domain of the

noise term of the volatility and it regulates the transition from nonmonotonic to monotonic

regimes of MET. The results of our simulations show that the NES eﬀect can be observed

as a function of the volatility reverting level b, the eﬀect being modulated by the parameter

(ab)/c. The phenomenon disappears if the noise term is predominant in comparison with

the reverting term. Moreover the eﬀect is no more observable if the parameter c pushes the

system towards a too noisy region. When the noise term is coupled to the reverting term, we

observe the NES eﬀect on the variable c. The eﬀect disappears if b is so high as to saturate

the system.

We compare now the theoretical PDF for the escape time of the returns with that obtained

from the same real market data used in the previous section. We deﬁne two thresholds,

∆xi = 0.1σ∆x and ∆xf = 1.0σ∆x, which represent respectively start point and end point

for calculating τ . The standard deviation σ∆x of the return series is calculated over a

long time period corresponding to that of real data. The initial position is x0 =

are in the range in which we observe the nonmonotonic behavior of MET. This means that

in this parameter region we observe a stabilizing eﬀect of the noise in time windows of prices

data for which we have a ﬁxed variation of returns between ∆xi and ∆xf . This encourages

us to extend our analysis to large amounts of ﬁnancial data and to explore other parameter

regions of the model.

III. ESCAPE TIMES FOR INTRA-DAY RETURNS

In this last section we discuss the results obtained with the same analysis of the previous

section, applied to a diﬀerent data set at intra-day time scale. The data set contains 100

stocks in the 4-year period 1995–1998. The stocks considered are those used, in that period,

in the S&P100 basket. We are dealing therefore with highly capitalized ﬁrms. The data

are extracted from the Trade and Quote database. The stocks are distributed in diﬀerent

market sectors as illustrated in Ref. [21]. For the analysis we considered the return on a

time interval equal to δt = 1170sec, which is approximately equal to 20 minute and it is

contained in a market day exactly 20 times. So we have 19 price returns per day, which

amounts to 20220 points in the whole period of 4 years per each of the 100 stocks. We

used the value

0.5

σ as a start position and the value

7.0

σ as absorbing barrier. We

−

·

−

·

can choose a so high value for the barrier because return distribution on intra-day time

11

scale have tails fatter than daily return distribution, therefore the statistical accuracy for so

high barrier value is good enough. The distribution of escape times obtained is reported in

Fig. 6 in a semi-logarithmic plot. It has an exponential trend superimposed to a ﬂuctuating

component. One can recognize that the period of the ﬂuctuation is 1 trading day, so this

eﬀect has to be ascribed to something that happens inside the daily activity. To describe

better this aspect we record, for each barrier hitting event, the hour when the event occurs

and we build a histogram showing the number of barrier hitting events as a function of the

day time. This histogram (see the inset of Fig. 6) clearly shows that the barrier hitting takes

place more frequently near the opening and the closure of the market. This happens because

the volatility follows a well known deterministic pattern during the day, being higher near

the market opening and closure, and lower in the middle of the trading day. In the same

inset we report an estimation of the volatility per hour, which we calculate as the standard

deviation of the return observed in that hour, in the whole period for all the 100 stocks.

The ﬁgure shows that the volatility has a pattern reproducing that observed in the barrier

hitting event histogram. This is in agreement with our considerations.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We studied the statistical properties of the hitting times in diﬀerent models for stock

market evolution. We discussed limitations and features of the basic geometric Brownian

motion in comparison with more realistic market models, such as those developed with a

stochastic volatility. Our results indeed show that to ﬁt well the escape time distribution

obtained from market data, it is necessary to take into account the behavior of market

volatility. In the generalized Heston model the reverting rate a can be used to modulate

the intensity of the stabilizing eﬀect of the noise observed (NES), by varying b and c. In

this parameter region the probability density function of the escape times of the returns ﬁts

very well that obtained from the real market data. The analysis on intra-day time scale

shows another peculiarity: the intra-day volatility pattern produces periodic oscillations in

the escape time distribution. This characteristic will be subject of further investigation.

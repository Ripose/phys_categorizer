Abstract

We introduce a mathematical criterion deﬁning the bubbles or the crashes in ﬁnancial market

price ﬂuctuations by considering exponential ﬁtting of the given data. By applying this criterion

we can automatically extract the periods in which bubbles and crashes are identiﬁed. From stock

market data of so-called the Internet bubbles it is found that the characteristic length of bubble

period is about 100 days.

INTRODUCTION

The analysis of bubbles or crashes in ﬁnancial markets is hot study in econophysics

[1, 2]. These phenomena are often big social problems like the cases of the Black Monday

or the Internet bubble. However, the deﬁnition of the bubbles or the crashes is not clear so

far, namely, there is no mathematical deﬁnition or criterion formula of these phenomena.

In order to tackle this problem we pay attention to an empirical fact that an exponential

curve ﬁts better to bubble or crash data than the popular linear trend lines. By mathe-

matically describing the exponential ﬁtting we try to propose a mathematical deﬁnition

of bubbles and crashes, so that we can automatically specify the period of a bubble and crush.

In this paper we analyze the high-frequency NASDAQ data focusing on the Internet

bubble or the dot-com bubble appeared at the end of 20th century. We calculate an average

of prices every thirty seconds in the tick data. Regular trading time in NASDAQ is from

9;30 to 16;00, so the number of data points in a day is 780.

EXTRACTION OF THE EXPONENTIAL BEHAVIORS

We introduce the following formula for extracting the exponential behaviors in the ﬁnan-

cial time series.

P (t) − P0(i; Ti) = ω1(i; Ti){P (t − 1) − P0(i; Ti)} + F (t)

(1)

This formula has an autoregressive form where the current state is given by the past states.

In this formula, P (t) is a price at time t, ω1(i; Ti) is the parameter characterizing the

exponential behaviors in the i-th period of length Ti, If ω1(i; Ti) is larger than 1.0, the time

series are either exponentially increasing or decreasing, then P0(i; Ti) gives the base line

of these exponential divergence. If ω1(i; Ti) is less or equal to 1.0, it means that there is

no bubble-like trend or the time series is convergent, then P0(i; Ti) shows an asymptotic

line. F (t) is residual noise term. The parameters ω1(i; Ti) and P0(i; Ti) can be determined

uniquely under the condition that minimizes the errors, which is the sum of squares of F (t).

ESTIMATION OF THE OPTIMAL PERIOD

For applying Eq.(1) to the time series, we need to estimate the length of the period Ti

that can be ﬁtted by an exponential function. We introduce a minimum period of Ti by

using the following well-known auto-regressive (N) model for the price diﬀerence time series.

j=N −1

∆P (t) =

X
j=1
∆P (t) = P (t) − P (t − 1)

bj∆P (t − j) + f (t)

(2)

(3)

Here, bj give the AR parameters that make the residue, f (t), almost an independent random

noise [3, 4, 5]. In this equation we tune the parameters of AR so that the standard deviation

of f (t) as similar as possible to the real stock price data such as Yahoo! Inc.(ticker symbol

YHOO). Now we deﬁne the time scale of Ti by the minimum time scale that satisﬁes the

condition where ω1(i; Ti) is always less or equal to 1.0 when the time series are created by the

Eqs. (2) and (3) with N=5. Actually, by changing Ti from 1 day to 100 days, the frequency

of ﬁnding ω1(i; Ti) larger than 1.0 decreases. When we set Ti to be longer than 100 days, we

cannot observe ω1(i; Ti) to take a value larger than 1.0 in practical sense. Therefore, we ﬁx

the optimal time scale Ti for observing the exponential behaviors to be 100 days. On the

basis of this AR analysis, if we observe ω1(i; Ti) larger than 1.0 in the time range of 100 days

in real data, we can say that the real time series ﬂuctuation of that range is statistically

diﬀerent from the AR model which implies that a non-stationary description is needed.

ASSIGNMENT OF BUBBLE, CRASH AND CONVERGENCE

We now assign each time step (one time step is thirty seconds) either exponential or

convergent. If the observing box of 100 days is judged as exponentially diverging, that means

ω1(i; Ti) is larger than 1.0 in the box, we assign all time steps in the box as exponential.

Then, we shift the box by one time step, and calculate ω1(i; Ti) for the new box. If the value

of ω1(i; Ti) is less than 1.0, then only the latest time step is assigned as convergent. Repeating

this process to cover all the data we can separate the exponential periods and convergent

periods, see Fig.2. At this stage the length of each period takes any value independent of

the observing time scale Ti. Note that we can detect the start of slow exponential behavior

before the extreme price ﬂuctuations as found in Fig.3.

The convergent period (line) are B, D and F.

Next, we calculate the parameters ω1(i; Ti) and P0(i; Ti) to each period by applying Eq.(1)

again. Then, we can draw an exponential trend curve for each exponential period as shown

in Fig.2 by using the following equation.

Ptrend(t) = ω1(i; Ti)Ptrend(t − 1) + (1 − ω1(i; Ti))P0(i; Ti)

bubble.

In this equation Ptrend(t) is the exponential trend price at time t. When the exponential

trend is diverging upward we call it as ”bubble”, when it is diverging downward it is called

as ”crash”. When the trend curve is converging we call it as ”convergence”. The starting

value of this price in each period is derived from theoretical calculation. From Fig.2 we ﬁnd

that the exponential behaviors are continuing more than 250 days in the period A. A critical

case may be the period D. As this period starts with a sharp drop, it may intuitively look

a kind of ”crash”, however, according to our analysis the trend line shows a convergence to

a lower price.

equation.

In Fig.4 we compare the error estimation between our exponential approximation and the

usual linear approximation in each period. The errors E(i) are calculated by the following

E(i) = q< (P (t) − Ptrend(t))2 >

(5)

The linear approximation is determined by the least-square-method. We can ﬁnd that

errors become smaller for exponential approximation compared to the linear approximation

in cases of the bubbles or crashes (the periods A,C and E).

The residual error F (t) in Eq. (1) is not perfectly uncorrelated because just extracting

the exponential trends in big scale can not extract all local trends. In order to separate pure

noises we apply the Yule-Walker formula for the time series of F (t)

F (t) =

aj(i; Ti)F (t − j) + N(t)

Then, Eqs.(1) and (7) make the following equation.

CONCLUSION

In this paper we have mathematically deﬁned bubbles and crashes by the exponential

behaviors. As we have discussed in proceeding section this method can be used for prediction

of large price changes in macroscopic scale. However, the predictive information in our

method is not enough, for example, we can not tell when a bubble will stop. As a future work

we are now combining the potential analysis method with this bubble detection technique

to clarify the mechanism of bubbles and crashes [6, 7, 8].

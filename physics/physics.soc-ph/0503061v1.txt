This work presents a model that allows the study of research specialties through the manifestations
of the specialty’s social and epistemological processes in a collection of journal papers. Collections of
papers are modeled as coupled bipartite networks interlinking 7 types of entities. Matrix-based link
weight functions are introduced to calculate weighted bipartite networks and weighted unipartite
co-occurrence networks in the collection of papers. These weight calculation methods, when used in
conjunction with unweighted bipartite growth models, produce simple growth models for weighted
networks in collections of papers.

I.

INTRODUCTION

knowledge networks.

A collection of journal papers is a database of papers
that comprehensively samples the journal literature of
a scientiﬁc specialty. As such, the social and epistemo-
logical processes of the specialty are manifested in the
complex network of linkages among entities within the
collection of papers. These manifestations are studied by
bibliometricians and subject matter experts to assess the
state of research in a specialty, and such studies are used
to advise managers and policy makers in both govern-
ment and industry to facilitate research management.

It is important to develop both complex network mod-
els and network analysis tools that can be applied to
collections of papers. Such tools must be used for the
problem of predicting how the underlying processes of a
research specialty are manifested in a collection of pa-
pers, and more importantly, to perform the inverse prob-
lem of modeling research specialty processes from their
manifestations in collections of papers. Examples of use-
ful information about research specialties to be extracted
from collections of papers include: 1) identifying social
structures such as research teams, groups of experts, and
leaders of ’schools of thought’, 2) identifying knowledge
structure, such as research subtopics, base knowledge,
and exemplars, and 3) identifying temporal trends and
events such as discoveries, emergence of new specialties
and research teams, knowledge accretion, and creation
and obsolescence of concepts and exemplars.

This paper introduces a structural model of cou-
pled networks in collections of journal papers and pro-
poses a construction method for bipartite and unipartite
weighted networks from such collections. The methods
presented here constitute an important step in the eﬀort
to apply the developing science of complex networks the-
ory to collections of papers and eventually to the study
of scientiﬁc specialties as complex social networks and

As complex networks, collections of papers have three
distinguishing characteristics: 1) they are formed from
coupled networks of many diﬀerent types of entities, e.g.,
papers, references, authors, 2) both unipartite and bipar-
tite networks in collections of papers are best expressed
as weighted networks, where strength of linkage between
pairs of entities is expressed as a positive real link weight,
and 3) collections of papers are best represented as col-
lections of bipartite networks.

To date, the phenomenon of coupled networks has re-
ceived little attention in the physics literature. Zheng
and Ergun [50] model the simultaneous growth of two
loosely coupled sections of a unipartite network and
show conditions for power-law link distributions in the
crosslinks between network sections. Borner, et al, model
the simultaneous growth of citation networks and author
collaboration networks by modeling behavior of authors
[12].

In contrast to the paucity of research on coupled net-
works, recently a great deal of study has been focused
on weighted networks. Yook, et al [49], originally inves-
tigated growing weighted networks using preferential at-
tachment rules and random attachment rules. Newman
[38] showed that weighted networks could be expressed
as multigraphs, and explained how this treatment allows
generalization of many analysis techniques of unweighted
networks to weighted networks. Barrat, et al [7], studied
a large weighted author collaboration network, and the
weighted world airline network, and showed that these
networks have diﬀerences in correlations of node degrees
to strength and clustering. Other studies focus on the
statistical properties of weighted networks [3, 9, 11, 26],
transport models of weighted networks [5, 21, 22], or
growth models of weighted networks [4, 8, 10, 16, 20].
Fan, et al [19],and Li, et al [30], gathered a collection
of papers on the specialty of econophysics, and studied
a weighted unipartite collaboration network of authors
from that collection.

On the topic of bipartite networks, recently several pa-
pers have reported on structural models and growth mod-
els. Ergun [18] models the human sexual contact network

as a bipartite graph, with growth having preferential at-
tachment rules similar to a Yule process. Ramasco, et
al, present a bipartite Yule model for paper to author
networks [39]. Guillaueme and Latapy [24] also present
a bipartite Yule model and propose a method of deriving
a bipartite expression of any unipartite network. Morris
[33] proposes the use of general bipartite Yule processes
for entity-type pairs in collections of journal papers, and
gives examples for paper to reference networks and pa-
per to author networks. Morris [32] also gives a detailed
analysis of a bipartite Yule model for paper to reference
networks that models heavily cited exemplar references
in emerging specialties. Goldstein, et al, [23] and Mor-
ris, et al, [35] propose bipartite Yule models for paper to
author networks that model the success-breeds-success
phenomenon for teams of authors.

As shown in Figure 1, a collection of journal papers
constitutes a series of coupled bipartite networks. As di-
agrammed in the ﬁgure, a collection of papers contains
6 direct bipartite networks: 1) papers to paper authors,
2) papers to references, 3) papers to paper journals, 4)
papers to terms, 5) references to reference authors, and
6) references to reference journals. Additionally, there
are 15 indirect bipartite networks in collections of papers
as deﬁned by the diagram. Examples of interesting indi-
rect networks are paper authors to reference authors, and
paper journals to reference journals networks, which can
be used for author co-citation analysis [46] and journal
co-citation analysis [31] respectively.

This paper introduces a formal matrix-based treatment
of coupled bipartite structures in collections of papers.
This treatment is used to calculate the weights of indi-
rect bipartite networks and is extended to calculation of
weights of unipartite co-occurrence networks in the col-
lection. For example, the proposed method can be used
to calculate the weights of a bipartite paper author to ref-
erence network, or, it can be used to ﬁnd weights of the
unipartite co-occurrrence network of authors that link to

2

common papers (a co-authorship network).

The proposed matrix-based technique is similar to
multi-port analysis using ABCD parameters in electri-
cal networks [13]. The method is also very similar to
methods used in multi-layer neural networks [25].

In conjunction with simple bipartite Yule growth mod-
els [33], the proposed weight calculation method produces
simple models of weighted network growth, growing as it
does from unweighted direct links that occur as papers
are added to the collection.

II. COLLECTIONS OF JOURNAL PAPERS

A. Research specialties

A research specialty is a self-organized social orga-
nization whose members tend to study a common re-
search topic, attend the same conferences, publish in the
same journals, cite each other’s work, and belong to the
same social networks that are known as invisible colleges
[15]. Thomas Kuhn, the pioneer of the study of research
processes, considered specialties to be quite small, ”100
members, sometimes considerably less” [29].

The processes that drive research specialties are
twofold: 1) social processes of research teams, communi-
cation networks, and collaboration, and 2) epistemologi-
cal processes of the discovery, emergence, accretion, and
obsolescence of knowledge. As described by Kuhn, the
distinguishing feature of a specialty is its paradigm, which
is the researchers’ ”way of thinking” about their problem:
models, analytical techniques, validation standards and
so forth. Progress in a specialty is characterized by long
and stable periods of puzzle-solving within the specialty’s
paradigm, punctuated by discoveries that accompany the
overthrow and/or creation of new paradigms [29]. This
characteristic of specialties is similar to punctuated equi-
libria phenomena [17] that characterize self-organizing
systems [6].

Specialties create their own literature, i.e., a body of
journal papers and books that broadly focus on the spe-
cialty’s research topic. We deﬁne a collection of papers as
a list of journal papers that constitutes a comprehensive
sample of a specialty’s journal literature. As a working
deﬁnition, deﬁne a collection of papers as a database of
records, one record per paper, that contains information
about the individual papers in such a list.

Although the range of size of such collections is large,
the size of such collections is much smaller than the im-
mense databases of papers that are often studied in the
physics literature. Morris [32], using back-of-envelope
style approximations, suggests that collections of papers
should range from as few as 100 papers to as many as
5000 papers. Huge heterogeneous datasets, such as the
SPIRES database [40], 20 years of PNAS papers [12], 100
years of Physical Review journals [41], or all the chem-
istry publications of the Netherlands [45], are not collec-
tions of papers as deﬁned here, because they all sample

more than one specialty’s literature. Despite this concep-
tual constraint, the weight calculation method proposed
here can still be applied to such huge collections.

B. Deﬁnition of collections of journal papers

For discussion in this paper, a collection of journal pa-
pers is a database where each record corresponds to a
journal paper. For each paper, its associated authors,
index terms and publication
cited references, journal,
year are listed. Furthermore, for each reference, a ref-
erence author, reference journal, and reference year are
listed. As deﬁned here, collections of papers are con-
structed to comprehensively sample the literature of a
scientiﬁc specialty. For our purposes, collections of pa-
pers are typically downloaded from the Science Citation
Index using Thompson/ISI’s Web of Science product [51].
Queries and seed references are used to gather topic spe-
ciﬁc collections that cover a specialty. The records for
these papers are typically collected into text ﬁles using a
tagged ﬁle format and downloaded for analysis. For the
purpose of demonstrating the concepts proposed in this
paper, a ﬁctitious collection of four papers is given in the
Appendix that covers the ﬁctional specialty of improb-
ability generation. (Apologies to humor author Douglas
Adams.) This example collection is provided to allow
readers to understand the extraction of entities and links
from the source data of the collection. For illustrative
purposes the entities in this example are more densely
linked than would normally be found in such a small col-
lection of papers.

A collection of papers can be considered as a network
of bibliographic entities of various entity-types [36]. Bib-
liographic entities may correspond to physical entities in
the real world, and more than one bibliographic entity
may correspond to the same physical entity. For exam-
ple, a paper and a reference in a collection of papers may
both correspond to the same physical paper in the real
world.

It is common in studies of networks in journal literature
to match references to papers to build a model of ”papers
citing papers”, usually referred to as a citation network
[2]. There are both methodological and theoretical rea-
sons to avoid this type of treatment: 1) on one hand,
a collection of papers typically has 20 times more refer-
ences than papers, making such citation network models
grossly incomplete because unmatched papers and ref-
erences (including references corresponding to books),
have unknown incoming and outgoing links, 2) the second
problem is that references, especially highly cited refer-
ences, can be considered as concept symbols [32, 44], and
therefore should be considered as separate entity-types
from papers, which merely represent undiﬀerentiated re-
search reports. Figuratively, it is inappropriate to use
an ”apples-citing-apples” model when the actual network
is ”apples-citing-oranges.” Further discussion of citation
networks is outside the scope of this paper.

3

For our proposed structural model of collections of
journal papers presented in this paper, we will limit our
discussion to a model comprised of 7 entity-types: 1) pa-
pers, 2) paper authors, 3) paper journals, 4) index terms,
5) references, 6) reference authors and 7) reference jour-
nals. Index terms are terms supplied by authors or ab-
stract services to associate with papers for search and
classiﬁcation purposes. Paper authors are the authors
of papers, while reference authors are the authors asso-
ciated with references. Paper journals are the journals
that papers are published in, while reference journals are
the journals associated with references. References cor-
responding to books, ﬁlms, web pages, and eprint archive
articles have no associated reference journal.

Using the 7 entity-types given in our structural model,
Figure 1 illustrates that a collection of journal papers
constitutes a series of coupled bipartite networks. As
noted in Section I, there are 6 direct bipartite net-
works and 15 indirect bipartite networks in this struc-
tural model. These indirect bipartite networks are best
analyzed as weighted networks and those weights can be
calculated from the paths of direct links that connect
entities in the two partitions of interest.

Note the ﬁctitious collection of papers in the Appendix.
The source ﬁle for this collection, which consists of 4
papers, is listed in ISI tagged ﬁle format. See footnote
[52]. The extracted entities for this collection consists
of 4 papers, 3 paper authors, 4 paper journals, 7 index
terms, 10 references, 6 reference authors, and 7 reference
journals. These entities and their corresponding index
numbers are listed in the Appendix.

III. BIPARTITE NETWORKS IN
COLLECTIONS OF JOURNAL PAPERS

A. Dyad deﬁnitions

In a dyad, the two entities can be: 1) like entities, that
is, entities of the same entity-type, or 2) unlike entities,
that is, entities of diﬀerent entity-types. Direct links are
deﬁned as direct associations. A paper has direct links to
its authors (paper authors), its associated index terms,
the references the paper cites, and the journal the paper
was published in. A reference is directly linked to the
papers that cite it, the author associated with the refer-
ence (reference author), and the journal that is associated
with the reference (reference journal).

Indirect links are links between two unlike entities that
occur over a path of two or more direct links. For exam-
ple, a paper author is indirectly linked to a reference
author if he or she authors a paper that cites a reference
that is associated with that reference author.

The ﬁrst entity of interest in a dyad is the primary en-
tity while the other entity is the secondary entity. Desig-
nation of primary entity-type and secondary entity-type
in direct and indirect bipartite networks is arbitrary and
is assumed to be based on the interest of the investigator.

TABLE I: Variable conventions used for entities in collections
of papers.

r: reference
ar: reference author
jr: reference journal
yr: reference year

p: paper
ap: paper author
jp: paper journal
yp: paper year
t: term
xi: unspeciﬁed entity
Preﬁx ’n’ to any entity variable to denote the number
of entities in the collection of that entity-type, e.g., np
denotes the number of papers in the collection

For co-occurrence networks, the primary and secondary
entity-types are explicitly deﬁned, as will be explained in
Section IV F. Co-occurrence links are between like pri-
mary entities and occur when both entities link to the
same secondary entity. For example, two papers have a
co-occurrence link when they both cite a common ref-
erence, or, in another example, two paper authors have
a co-occurrence link if they coauthor a paper.
In co-
occurrence links the like entities of the dyad are primary
entities, while the unlike entities to which they co-link
are the secondary entities.

B. Dyad identiﬁer notation

Table I lists the conventions used here to denote entity-
type variables within a collection of papers. The variables
x1, x2, and so forth will be used to denote unspeciﬁed
entity-types. Dyad notation is used to specify dyad types
in the collection of papers. The symbols of primary and
secondary entity-types associated with dyads are sepa-
rated by a comma and placed between square brackets,
e.g., [x1, x2], where x1 denotes the primary entity-type,
and x2 denotes the secondary entity-type. This nota-
tion will be referred to as the dyad identiﬁer, and will be
used as a suﬃx to variables to specify the entity-types
of interest. However, the dyad identiﬁer will be dropped
to reduce clutter in the notation when the primary and
secondary entity-types are obvious from context. Some
examples of the use of dyad identiﬁers:

• O[p, r] denotes an occurrence matrix listing the
links of papers, the primary entity-type, to refer-
ences, the secondary entity-type.

• C[ap, p] denotes the co-occurrence matrix listing
the co-authorship counts of pairs of paper authors,
the primary entity-type, in papers, the secondary
entity-type.

C. Bipartite networks

Bipartite networks are comprised of two distinct par-
titions of nodes, where all links in the network are from

entities in the ﬁrst partition to entities in the second par-
tition. For our purposes, the ﬁrst partition exclusively
holds entities of some entity-type, while the other parti-
tion exclusively holds entities of some other entity-type.
As an example, Figure 2 shows a diagram of a bipartite
network of a partition of papers linked to a partition of
references. Note that links only occur between papers
and references and that there are no links between pairs
of papers or pairs of references.

Assume the diagrammatic convention as shown in Fig-
ure 3, that entities of x1, the primary entity-type, are the
entities in the group on the left and the entities of x2, the
secondary entity-type, are the entities in the group to the
right. There are nx1 primary entities and nx2 secondary
entities. The strength of the link between x1 entity i and
x2 entity j is the link weight, oij [x1, x2].

D. Occurrence matrices

Mathematically, the links in a bipartite network are
described by a rectangular adjacency matrix, which we’ll
deﬁne as an occurrence matrix. This is an nx1 by nx2
matrix that lists all the link weights between the entities
of the two partitions:

O[x1, x2] = 

Figure 3 shows how the links in a bipartite network cor-
respond to elements in its occurrence matrix. There is a
bipartite network for every possible pair of entity-types in
the collection of papers. Occurrence matrices for entity-
type pairs with direct relations are derived directly from
the tables in the collection’s database. For the example

collection of papers discussed in this paper, the occur-
rence matrices for the 6 direct bipartite networks in the
collection are given in the Appendix. Occurrence matri-
ces for entity-type pairs with indirect links are calculated
by cascading bipartite networks of direct links, as will be
shown later.

Note the following property of occurrence matrices:

O[x1, x2] = O[x2, x1]T

(2)

Using dyad identiﬁer notation, exchanging the vari-
ables is equivalent to transposing the occurrence matrix.

E. Coupled and cascaded bipartite networks

Coupled bipartite networks are pairs of bipartite net-
works that share a common partition. Figure 4 shows
an author to paper network coupled to a paper to refer-
ence network through common papers using the example
collection of papers in the Appendix. Cascaded bipartite
networks are comprised of a series of two or more cou-
pled bipartite networks. Figure 5 shows an example of
such a cascade, where a reference author to reference net-
work is coupled to a reference to paper network that is
in turn coupled to a paper to paper author network. We
deﬁne the extreme left and right partitions as the outer
partitions and all other partitions as the inner partitions.
Assume that we are interested in describing the links
between two diﬀerent types of entities as a weighted bi-
partite network. We ﬁrst ﬁnd a cascade of networks

where the two entity-types of interest are the outer parti-
tions. Then it is necessary to apply some algorithm that
meaningfully reduces the indirect links between pairs of
opposite outer entities as weights in a bipartite network
joining those outer entities. Intuitively, we want pairs of
outer entities that have many indirect links through the
inner partitions to have more weight than those pairs of
outer entities with few or no connecting links.

For example, suppose that we wish to ﬁnd a weighted
bipartite network between reference authors and paper
authors for the purpose of conducting author co-citation
analysis [46]. We can ﬁnd a cascade of bipartite networks
as shown in Figure 5, where reference authors are linked
to their references, the references are linked to the pa-
pers that cite them, and those papers are linked to the
paper authors that authored them. The weights of a bi-
partite network of reference authors to paper authors are
found by ﬁnding the indirect links between each reference
author and paper author through references and papers,
and applying an algorithm that produces a weight from
those identiﬁed indirect links. The more indirect links be-
tween a reference author and a paper author, the more
weight should be assigned to the link between them in
the resulting bipartite network.

IV. ALGORITHM FOR CONSTRUCTION OF
WEIGHTED BIPARTITE NETWORKS

A. Reducing a cascade of bipartite networks to a
single weighted bipartite network

Given a cascade of bipartite networks with occurrence
matrices O[x1, x2], O[x2, x3], . . . , O[xn−1, xn], this cas-
cade can be reduced to a single bipartite network with
occurrence matrix O[x1, xn] listing the link weights be-
tween the x1 entities and the xn entities in the network.
The proposed weight algorithm is iterative and works by
sequentially reducing two adjacent networks to a single
network, then reducing that weighted network and its ad-

jacent network. This process continues until only a single
bipartite network remains.

The algorithm is based on using a generalized form of
matrix arithmetic. Given a pair of opposite outer en-
tities, the algorithm ﬁnds all unique paths from the left
outer entity to the right outer entity, and assigns a weight
to each of those paths. The weights of these parallel paths
are then combined to calculate the weight of the link be-
tween the two entities.

B. Reducing adjacent coupled bipartite networks
to a single weighted bipartite network

Consider a pair of coupled bipartite networks, with
entity-types x1, x2, and x3, as shown in Figure 6. Oc-
currence matrices O[x1, x2] and O[x2, x3] enumerate the
links in the two bipartite networks in this ﬁgure. Each
link in the ﬁgure is labeled with its corresponding oc-
currence matrix element. There are nx1, nx2, and nx3
entities of the entity-types x1, x2, and x3 respectively. A
pair of links that connects an x1 entity to an x3 entity is
deﬁned as a path. Figure 7, part (a) shows a path from x1
entity i to x3 entity j, connected through x2 entity k by
links oik[x1, x2] and okj [x2, x3]. There are nx2 possible
paths from x1 entity i to x3 entity j as shown in Figure
7 part (b).

The path weight associated with a path is calculated
from the weights of the path’s two links using a path
weight function:

pij(k) = f2(oik[x1, x2], okj [x2, x3]),

O[x2, x3] to produce element oij of matrix O[x1, x3]. As
shown, the function f2 is applied to matching elements of
the row vector and column vector to produce nx2 scalar
results. The function f1 operates on all these nx2 results
to produce the ﬁnal scalar result oij [x1, x3].

The concepts of 1) bipartite networks of entities, 2)
cascaded bipartite networks, and 3) link weight functions,
provide a systematic means of ﬁnding multiple indirect
links between outer entities in cascades of bipartite net-
works, and combining those multiple links as a weight
in a bipartite network between the outer entities. The
choice of path weight function and path combining func-
tion is generally driven by the application. In the case of
cascades of unweighted bipartite networks, matrix mul-
tiplication makes a good link weight function because it
yields weights that are equal to occurrence counts. For
example, for a paper to reference network coupled to a
reference to reference author network, matrix multipli-
cation as a link weight function will produce weights,
oij [p, ar], that are the the number of times paper i cites
reference author j.

In other situations, however, other link weight func-
tions are more appropriate. For example, when reducing
cascades of weighted bipartite networks, it is necessary to
consider how to compute path weights from the two links
in a path. Suppose we have a weighted bipartite network
of linguistic terms to papers in a collection of papers.
The weights, oij [t, p], in this network are the number of

7

times term i appears in the body of paper j. Now assume
this matrix is coupled to a paper to reference author net-
work, and that there is a path from term i to reference
author j that corresponds to 10 occurrences of term i
in paper k, which cites reference author j 2 times.
If
we use multiplication as the path weight function, then
this yields 10 × 2 = 20 for the path weight. This has
no meaning as an occurrence count between term i and
reference author j. In this case we may want to simply
use a link weight equal to the number of times reference
author j is cited by paper k, or use a link weight equal to
the minimum of the number of times paper k cites refer-
ence author j and the number of times term i occurs in
paper k. We can also express the two links in the path
as electrical conductances and calculate the path weight
as the resulting conductance of those two conductances
in series.

The next three subsections will describe three link
weight functions: 1) matrix multiplication, appropriate
for cascades of unweighted networks, 2) the overlap func-
tion, appropriate for cascades of weighted occurrence net-
works, and 3) the inverse Minkowski function, used to
compute paths weights as similar to conductances in se-
ries.

C. Link weight function using matrix
multiplication

For applications where at least one of the matrix ar-
guments is binary, matrix multiplication is often used as
the link weight function because it directly yields weights
that are simple occurrence and co-occurrence counts in
the resulting reduced bipartite matrix.

If the path weight function f2 is deﬁned as a product:

f2

oik[x1, x2], okj [x2, x3]

= oik[x1, x2] · okj [x2, x3] (6)

(cid:18)

(cid:19)
and the path combining function f1 is a summation:

f1

f2

oi1[x1, x2], o1j[x2, x3]

, . . . ,

(cid:16)

(cid:0)

f2

oi nx2 [x1, x2], onx2 j[x2, x3]

(cid:1)

(cid:0)

(cid:1)(cid:17)

=

f2

oik[x1, x2], okj[x2, x3]

.

(7)

(cid:0)
Then the link weight function is simply standard matrix
multiplication:

(cid:1)

oij[x1, x3] =

oik[x1, x2] · okj [x2, x3].

(8)

As an example, assume that x1, x2, and x3 are paper
authors, papers and references respectively, taken from
the example collection of papers in the Appendix. The
binary matrix O[ap, p], the transpose of O[p, ap], Equa-
tion (A.2), lists the links of the individual paper authors

to each paper, while the binary matrix O[p, r], Equation
(A.1), lists the links of individual papers with each ref-
erence. Using matrix multiplication:

The result in Equation (12) gives the desired occur-
rence matrix of paper authors to reference authors for
the example. In this matrix, the weight oij[ap, ar] is the
number of times that paper author i cites reference au-
thor j.

D. Link weight function using the overlap function

The overlap function is useful for calculating weights of
links when reducing cascades of weighted bipartite net-
works. This is appropriate for calculating bipartite net-
works involving linguistic terms, and is also useful for
calculating weights in co-occurrence networks of refer-
ence authors and reference journals.

Think of the two links in a path as conduits, each with
a maximum capacity. The maximum capacity of these
two conduits in series is equal to that of the conduit with
the smallest capacity. Considering this series capacity as
the path weight, the path weight function becomes the
minimum of the weights of the two links on the path:

f2 = min

oik[x1, x2], okj [x2, x3]

.

(13)

Using a path combining function that sums the path
weights:

(cid:16)

nx2

k=1
X

(cid:16)

nx2

k=1

(cid:16)

.

(11)

f1 =

f2

oik[x1, x2], okj [x2, x3]

,

(14)

yields the overlap function [42] as the link weight func-
tion:

f1 =

min

oik[x1, x2], okj [x2, x3]

.

(15)

This can be deﬁned as a matrix operation ”OVL”:

O[x1, x3] = OV L

O[x1, x2], O[x2, x3]

.

This is a matrix, O[ap, r], in which weight, oij [ap, r], is
the number of times that paper author i cites reference
j.

Suppose we wish to ﬁnd the paper author to reference
author occurrence matrix of the example collection of
papers in the Appendix. Consulting Figure 1, the direct
links from paper authors to reference authors go from
paper author to paper to reference to reference author.
Calculation of the occurrence matrix, O[ap, ar], from pa-
per author to reference author is performed by the matrix
multiplication:

Discussion of the application and characteristics of this
function can be found in [27].

As an example, assume that x1, x2, and x3 are linguis-
tic terms, papers and reference authors respectively, as
shown in Figure 9. The matrix O[t, p] lists the occurrence
counts of the individual terms with each paper:

E. Link weight function using the inverse
Minkowski function

The inverse Minkowski function, an adaptation of the
well-known Minkowski distance metric [14], can be used
when it is desired to model path weights as if the link
weights were electrical conductances in series.
In this
case use the inverse Minkowski metric as the path weight
function:

f2 =

oik[x1, x2]

+

okj[x2, x3]

,

(20)

−p

(cid:20)(cid:16)

(cid:17)

(cid:16)

− 1
p

−p

(cid:21)

(cid:17)

9

oij [x1, x3] =

oik[x1, x2]

+

okj [x2, x3]

where p ranges from zero to positive inﬁnity. Note that,
in contrast to the Minkowski metric as normally ex-
pressed, the exponents in the inverse Minkowski met-
ric are negative. This function will always generate a
path weight that is less than or equal to the smallest link
weight in the path, modeling a situation where indirect
links tend to be weaker than direct links. Using a path
combining function that sums the path weights:

f1 =

f2

oik[x1, x2], okj [x2, x3]

(21)

yields the ﬁnal inverse Minkowski link weight function:

a matrix

O[x1, x3] = IN V M IN K

O[x1, x2], O[x2, x3]

.

(23)

(cid:16)
When this function is used with p = ∞, Equation (20)
produces the minimum of its arguments and so reverts to
Equation (13), making the inverse Minkowski link weight
function revert to the overlap link weight function. When
p = 1, then the path weight function, Equation (20),
becomes:

(cid:17)

1
oik[x1, x2]

+

1
okj [x2, x3]

f2 =

(cid:20)

−1

.

(cid:21)

(24)

This makes the path weight function produce a value that
is twice the harmonic average of the link weights of the
path. This is equivalent to calculating the path weight
by modeling the link weights as electrical conductances
in series.

The inverse Minkowski path weight function always
produces a path weight that is less than the smallest
weight on the path. This is appropriate in situations
where indirect paths should have less weight than direct
paths, and mathematically expresses a sensed diﬀusion,
or weakening, of the strength of linkage when linkage is
indirect.

F. Weights in unipartite co-occurrence networks

Co-occurrence networks are weighted unipartite net-
works of like entities where the links between pairs of
entities is the count of the number of common secondary
entities that the two primary entities both link to. For ex-
ample, in a bibliographic coupling network, the nodes are
papers, and the link weights are the number of common
references cited by each pair of papers. A co-occurrence
matrix is the adjacency matrix of a co-occurrence net-
work. For binary occurrence matrices the co-occurrence

matrix can be found by post multiplying the occurrence
matrix by its transpose. Using Equation (2):

C[x1, x2] = O[x1, x2] · O[x2, x1],

(25)

where C[x1, x2] is the co-occurrence matrix listing the
number of common associations of pairs of x1 entities
with x2 entities. For example, to calculate the co-
occurrence of papers by their links to references using
the paper to reference matrix from the example collec-
tion in the Appendix, use Equation (A.1):

The diagonal of the co-occurrence matrix cii[x1, x2]
lists the number of links that each x1 has with entities
of the x2 entity-type. For example, in the bibliographic
coupling matrix, C[p, r], calculated in Equation (26), the
diagonal lists the number of references each papers cites.
Computation of co-occurrences can be viewed, similar
to the discussion of Section III E, as the calculation of link
weights in a cascade of two bipartite networks. Given a
bipartite network of two unlike entity-types, mirror the
network across the secondary entity-type partition to ob-
tain a cascade of two networks. For example, the paper to
reference network shown in Figure 2 has been mirrored on
the references to produce the paper-reference-paper cas-
cade of two bipartite networks shown in Figure 10 (a).
Calculating the weights of this cascade using matrix mul-
tiplication will produce the co-occurrence counts of pa-
pers’ links to references, bibliographic coupling strength
[28], as was done in Equation (26).

The same network of Figure 2 can be mirrored on the
papers to produce the reference-paper-reference cascade
of bipartite networks shown in Figure 10(b). Calculat-
ing the link weights in this network using matrix mul-
tiplication yields the co-occurrence counts of references
links to papers, co-citation strength [43]. Note that each
occurrence matrix has two co-occurrence matrices asso-
ciated with it. Figure 11 illustrates this for a sample
paper to reference occurrence matrix, O[p, r]. To the

right of O[p, r] is the square symmetric bibliographic cou-
pling matrix C[p, r], whose size is number of papers in
O[p, r]. Similarly, below O[p, r] is the square symmetric
co-citation matrix, C[r, p] whose size is the number of
references in O[p, r].

Linguistic terms to paper networks, reference author to
paper networks and reference journal to paper networks
are weighted networks. Because of this, it is not desirable
to calculate their co-occurrence matrices using matrix
multiplication because the resulting link weights cannot
be interpreted. Noting that calculation of co-occurrence
matrices is analogous to computing link weights for a pair
of cascaded bipartite networks, as was demonstrated in
Figure 10 and the discussion above, other link weight
functions can be used to ﬁnd their co-occurrence matri-
ces. This can be done, for example, using the overlap
function of Section IV D.

V. RECURSIVE MATRIX GROWTH

The recursive growth equations presented in this sec-
tion are a natural outgrowth of the proposed matrix-
based mathematical treatment of collections of journal

papers. They are useful for the purpose of providing in-
sight into the character of occurrence distributions in the
collections, as will be explained.

The basic record in a collection of journal papers is
the paper. The collection grows paper by paper in the
temporal order of the publication dates of the papers.
When a new paper is added, it is associated with the
existing entities in the collection and additionally, new
entities, e.g., new paper authors or new references, and
new terms that enter into the collection.

This section will present a recursive model of the
growth of both occurrence and co-occurrence matrices as
papers are added to the collection. The recursive model
of matrix growth is found by examination of matrix parti-
tions in occurrence and co-occurrence matrices as papers
are added to the collection.

It is easiest to consider the growth of an example oc-
currence matrix. For convenience, the paper-reference
matrix will be studied. The results can be easily ex-
tended to other occurrence matrices, for example the pa-
per to paper author matrix [35]. In the matrix the rows
correspond to papers and are ordered in the sequence
of publication of the papers to which they correspond.
The columns correspond to references and are ordered

in the sequence in which their corresponding references
ﬁrst appear. As shown in Figure 12, the matrix contains
a descending stair step sequence of ones from its upper
left corner diagonally to its lower right corner. This se-
quence of ones corresponds to the initial appearance of
references as papers are added to the collection. Below
this diagonal sequence of ones is a roughly lower triangu-
lar region sparsely populated with ones that correspond
to citations to existing references as each paper is added.
Above the diagonal sequence of ones is a roughly upper
triangular area of zeros.

Considering the collection of journal papers dynami-
cally, the collection grows from an initial paper by se-
quential addition of papers in the order in which they
were published. In this sense the paper-reference matrix
Ω grows dynamically one paper at a time. Assume i
to be the number of papers, while nri is the number of
references that have appeared in all papers up to and in-
cluding paper i. Assume Ωi, whose size is i by nri, as the
paper-reference matrix after the addition of paper i, then
consider the addition of paper i + 1. A new row vector,
i + 1, is added to Ωi. This vector is partitioned into a 1
by i vector δi listing the paper’s citations to existing ref-
erences, and 1, a 1 by nri+1 −nri vector of ones occurring
in new columns added for the new references that have
appeared in paper i + 1. Figure 12 shows a pictorial rep-
resentation of this addition. In the new columns, 0, an i
by nri+1 −nri zero matrix appears. The recursive matrix
equation for growth of the paper-reference equation is:

Ωi+1 =

Ωi 0
δi 1 #

.

(29)

Figure 13 shows a map of a typical paper-reference ma-
trix, where each dot shows the location of a one in the
matrix.

As papers are added to the collection, note that in-
dividual papers collect no links after their initial ap-
pearance, while references cumulate links (citations from
newly appearing papers) as papers are added. Entity-
types that cumulate links in collections of papers usually
have a power-law frequency distribution relative to pa-
pers. Three such power-law distributions are well-known:
1) papers per paper author distribution (Lotka’s law)

[47], 2) papers per paper journal distribution (Bradford’s
law) [47], and papers per reference distribution (reference
power law) [37]. Papers, which don’t cumulate links, tend
to have exponential tailed distributions relative to other
entity-types. Two examples are authors per paper distri-
bution (1-shifted Poisson) [35], and references per paper
distribution (lognormal) [32].

The bibliographic coupling matrix, which will be des-
ignated β, is a symmetric matrix that lists the biblio-
graphic coupling counts of all pairs of papers within the
data collection. The diagonal of β contains the counts of
the number of references cited in each paper. The biblio-
graphic coupling matrix can be obtained by multiplying
the paper-reference matrix by its transpose:

β = Ω · ΩT .

(30)

The recursive growth equations for the bibliographic cou-
pling matrix can be derived by substituting (29) into
(30):

βi+1 = Ωi+1 · ΩT

i+1 =

Ωi · ΩT
i
δi · ΩT
i

Ωi · δT
i
i + 1 · 1T

δi · δT

#

βi
δi · ΩT

Ωi · δT
i
i mi+1 #

"

where mi+1 is the number of references cited by paper
i + 1. Figure 14 shows a pictorial representation of a typ-
ical bibliographic coupling matrix with the partitions in
Equation (31) identiﬁed. It is easy to see from Equation
(31) and Figure 14 that bibliographic coupling counts
between pairs of papers are static, and do not change as
more papers are added to the collection.

The co-citation matrix, designated as Γ, is a symmet-
ric nr by nr matrix that lists the co-citation counts of

diagonal of Γ contains the counts of the number of pa-
pers that cite each reference. The co-citation matrix can
be obtained by multiplying the transpose of the paper-
reference matrix by itself:

Γ = ΩT · Ω.

(32)

The recursive growth equations for the co-citation ma-
trix can be derived by substituting Equation (29) into
Equation (32):

Figure 15 shows a pictorial representation of a typical
co-citation matrix with the partitions in Equation (33)
identiﬁed.
It is easy to see that the co-citation count
between two references is not static, but can be increased
with the addition of each new paper to the collection.

VI. EXAMPLE

An illustrative example of the techniques outlined here
uses a collection of 902 papers on the topic of complex
network theory. This collection was gathered in 2003 by
ﬁnding all papers that cite key references in the specialty.
A detailed analysis of the paper to reference network for
this collection was presented by Morris [32], while anal-
ysis of the paper author to paper network for this collec-
tion was presented by Goldstein, et al, [23] and Morris,
et al, [35].

Figure 16 shows a weighted occurrence matrix,
O[ap, ar], for the paper author to reference author net-
In this diagram, the paper
work from this collection.

authors are rows, reference authors are columns, and the
size of the circle at position (i, j) in the diagram is pro-
portional to the link weight from paper author i to ref-
erence author j. In this case the link weight is equal to
the number of times that paper author i cited reference
author j.

In order to visualize the structure of links in the net-
work, the rows and columns of the matrix have been
arranged using a seriation algorithm [34] and clustering
dendrograms have been added on the left and top of the
ﬁgure [36]. The ﬁgure is meant to show collaboration
groups of paper authors and their links to reference au-
thors as symbols of ’schools of thought’ [48]. The visual-
ization technique of Figure 16 is explained in Morris and
Yen [36].

Only paper authors that authored 6 or more pa-
pers were visualized. For clustering paper authors, the
co-occurrence matrix of co-authorship counts, C[ap, p],
was calculated using matrix multiplication: C[ap, p] =
O[ap, p] · O[p, ap]. These co-authorship counts were con-
verted to distances and a hierarchical clustering routine
was applied to produce the dendrogram on the left of the
ﬁgure. Groups of paper authors clustered this way can
be regarded as ’research teams.’

Only reference authors that were cited 50 or more
times were visualized. For clustering reference authors,
the co-occurrence matrix of co-citation counts, C[ar, p],
was calculated using the overlap function: C[ar, p] =
OV L(O[ar, p], O[p, ar]). These co-citation counts were
converted to distances and a hierarchical clustering rou-
tine was applied to produce the dendrogram at the top
of the ﬁgure. Groups of reference authors clustered this
way can be regarded as representing ’schools of thought.’
to reference author matrix,
O[ap, ar], was calculated using matrix multiplication
O[ap, ar] = O[ap, p] · O[p, r] · O[r, ar]. The matrix clearly
shows that dominant reference authors in the specialty,
who are cited by authors to represent key ideas in the spe-
cialty, are heavily linked across all paper authors. Note
that there is evidence of correlation of groups of paper
authors to groups of reference authors. For example, pa-

REFERENCE AUTHORS 

FIG. 16: Visualization of the occurrence matrix of a weighted paper author to reference author network from a collection of
papers from the specialty of complex networks theory.

per authors Choi, Hong, Kim and Holme are all heavily
connected to reference authors Newman and Watts, while
paper authors Pastor-Satorras, Vespignani, Vazquez, and
Moreno are all heavily connected to reference authors
Pastor-Satorras and Albert.

This example illustrates the usefulness of the matrix-
based mathematical treatment of cascades of bipartite
networks in collection of journal papers.
In the exam-
ple, we have shown this treatment can be used for con-
struction of weighted unipartite co-occurrence networks
for clustering purposes: 1) paper authors linked by co-
authorship, and 2) reference authors linked by common
papers. Additionally, the method was used to calculate a
weighted bipartite network of paper authors to reference
authors.

VII. CONCLUSION

We have introduced several valuable methods that can
be used to apply complex networks theory to collections
of journal papers:

• The structural model of coupled bipartite
networks for collections of papers. This is a
novel model that allows analysis of any bipartite
network in the collection in a general, standard-
ized, manner. Further, it allows building a multi-
ple entity-type growth model of this system of net-
works, a technique not generally studied by com-
plex networks researchers.

• The matrix-based method of calculating
weighted bipartite networks. Using the general
concept of link weight functions, we have shown

that this matrix-based technique can be applied
to cascades of unweighted bipartite networks using
matrix multiplicaiton. Additionally, the technique
can be applied to cascades of weighted bipartite
networks using the overlap function or the inverse
Minkowski function.

• The

calculation of weighted unipartite
co-occurrence networks.
Considering co-
occurrence networks as coupled bipartite networks
made by mirroring around a bipartite partition,
calculation of weighted co-occurrence networks
uses the same matrix-based calculation method as
weighted bipartite networks.

• The

construction of

simple models of
weighted matrix growth. This structural model
of coupled bipartite networks, when considered
with unweighted bipartite growth models, such as
the bipartite Yule model, yields a simple model of
growth of weighted bipartite networks and weighted
unipartite co-occurrence networks. Morris [33]
has shown that simple bipartite Yule processes ef-
fectively simulate the statistics of bipartite and
weighted unipartite networks in collections of pa-
pers.

The structural model and matrix-based techniques in-
troduced here provide a uniﬁed framework of all entities
in networks of papers, e.g., paper to author networks
that are manifestations of social collaboration processes,
or paper to reference networks that are manifestations
of epistemological processes such as knowledge accretion
and exemplar knowledge in a specialty. Such networks
are often studied as decoupled processes despite their al-
most certain interdependence. For example, note that
the paper author to reference author network example
of Figure 16 shows correlations between groups of pa-
per authors and groups of reference authors. A realis-
tic model of processes in a research specialty should be
able to predict that such correlations will occur, but the
model must also predict the characteristics of the paper
author to paper network (such as Lotka’s law), and si-
multaneously predict the characteristics of the paper to
reference network (such as the reference power law.) All
of these bipartite networks are interdependent and those
interdependencies cannot be modeled using simple uni-
partite or bipartite growth models. The structural model
introduced here is a step toward modeling the complex
interdependencies in a research specialty.

Furthermore, and importantly, these techniques can
be applied to other report-based structures that can be
expressed as collections of entities. For example, a col-
lection of intelligence reports about terrorist events can,
after application of an entity extraction program, be ex-
pressed as a collection of entities: reports, place names,
terrorist group leader names, terrorist group names, gov-
ernment oﬃcials’ names, and incident types. These en-
tities are linked in a coupled bipartite structure, similar

15

to Figure 1 and analysis of those linkages could produce
useful information about networks of terrorists. So the
structural model introduced here may allow the study of
other self-organizing social organizations as well, through
their manifestations in collections of reports.

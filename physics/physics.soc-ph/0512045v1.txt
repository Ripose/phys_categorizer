We investigate how very large populations are able to reach a global consensus, out of local
”microscopic” interaction rules, in the framework of a recently introduced class of models of semiotic
dynamics, the so-called Naming Game. We compare in particular the convergence mechanism for
interacting agents embedded in a low-dimensional lattice with respect to the mean-ﬁeld case. We
highlight that in low-dimensions consensus is reached through a coarsening process which requires
less cognitive eﬀort of the agents, with respect to the mean-ﬁeld case, but takes longer to complete.
In 1-d the dynamics of the boundaries is mapped onto a truncated Markov process from which
we analytically computed the diﬀusion coeﬃcient. More generally we show that the convergence
process requires a memory per agent scaling as N and lasts a time N 1+2/d in dimension d ≤ 4 (the
upper critical dimension), while in mean-ﬁeld both memory and time scale as N 3/2, for a population
of N agents. We present analytical and numerical evidences supporting this picture.

The past decade has seen an important development
of the so-called Semiotic Dynamics, a new ﬁeld which
studies how conventions (or semiotic relations) can orig-
inate, spread and evolve over time in populations. This
occurred mainly trough the deﬁnition of Language inter-
action games [1, 2] in which a population of agents is seen
as a complex adaptive system which self-organizes [3] as a
result of simple local interactions (games). The interest
of physicists for Language Games comes from the fact
that they can be easily formulated as non-equilibrium
statistical mechanics models of interacting agents: at
each time step, an agent updates its state (among a cer-
tain set of possible states) through an interaction with its
neighbors. An interesting question concerns the possibil-
ity of convergence towards a common state for all agents,
which emerges without external global coordination and
from purely local interaction rules [4, 5, 6]. In this Let-
ter, we focus on the so-called Naming Games, introduced
to describe the emergence of conventions and shared lex-
icons in a population of individuals interacting with each
other by negotiations rules, and study how the embed-
ding of the agents on a low-dimensional lattice inﬂuences
the emergence of consensus, which we show to be reached
through a coarsening process. The original model [7] was
inspired by a well-known experiment of artiﬁcial intelli-
gence called Talking Heads [8], in which embodied soft-
ware agents develop their vocabulary observing objects
through digital cameras, assigning them randomly chosen
names and negotiating these names with other agents.

Recently a new minimal version of the Naming Game
endowed with simpliﬁed interactions rules [9] has been
introduced, that reproduces the phenomenology of the
experiments and is amenable to analytical treatment. In
this model, N individuals (or agents) observe the same
object, trying to communicate its name one to the other.
The identical agents have at their disposal an internal
inventory, in which they can store an unlimited number
of diﬀerent names or opinions. At the initial time, all

individuals have empty inventories, with no innate terms.
At each time step, the dynamics consists of a pairwise
interaction between randomly chosen individuals. Each
agent can take part in the interaction as a “speaker” or
as a “hearer”. The speaker transmits to the hearer a
possible name for the object at issue; if the speaker does
not know a name for the object (its inventory is empty),
it invents a name to be passed to the hearer[14], while
in the case it already knows more synonyms (stored in
the inventory), it chooses one of them randomly. The
hearer’s move is deterministic:
if it possesses the term
pronounced by the speaker, the interaction is a success,
and both speaker and hearer retain that name as the right
one, canceling all the other terms in their inventories;
otherwise, the new name is included in the inventory of
the hearer, without any cancellation.

The mean-ﬁeld (MF) case has been studied in [9]: the
system initially accumulates a large number of possible
names for the object since diﬀerent agents (speakers) ini-
tially invent diﬀerent names and propagate them. Inter-
estingly however, this profusion of diﬀerent names leads
in the end to an asymptotic absorbing state in which all
the agents share the same name.

Although this model leads to the convergence of all
agents to a common state or “opinion”, it is interesting
to notice the important diﬀerences with other commonly
studied models of opinion formation [4, 5, 6]. For exam-
ple, each agent can potentially be in an inﬁnite number
of possible discrete states (or words, names), contrarily
to the Voter model in which each agent has only two pos-
sible states [6]. Moreover, an agent can here accumulate
in its memory diﬀerent possible names for the object, i.e.
wait before reaching a decision. Finally, each dynamical
step involves a certain degree of stochasticity, while in
the Voter model, an agent deterministically adopts the
opinion of one of its neighbors.

In this Letter, we study the Naming Game model on
low-dimensional lattices: the agents, placed on a regu-

lar d-dimensional lattice, can interact only with their 2d
nearest neighbors. Numerical and analytical investiga-
tions allow us to highlight important diﬀerences with the
mean-ﬁeld case, in particular in the time needed to reach
consensus, and in the eﬀective size of the inventories or
total memory required. We show how the dynamics cor-
responds to a coarsening of clusters of agents sharing a
common name; the interfaces between such clusters are
composed by agents who still have more than one possi-
ble name.

Relevant quantities in the study of Naming Games are
the total number of words in the system Nw(t), which
corresponds to the total memory used by the agents, the
total number of diﬀerent words Nd(t), and the average
rate of success S(t) of the interactions. Fig. 1 displays
the evolution in time of these three quantities for the low-
dimensional models, compared to the mean-ﬁeld case.

In the initial state, all inventories are empty. At short
times therefore, each speaker with an empty inventory
has to invent a name for the object, and many diﬀer-
ent words are indeed invented. In this initial phase, the
success rate is equal to the probability that two agents
that have already played are chosen again: this rate is
proportional to t/E where E is the number of possible
interacting pairs, i.e. N (N
1)/2 for the mean-ﬁeld case
−
and N d in ﬁnite dimensions. S(t) grows thus N times
faster in ﬁnite dimensions, as conﬁrmed by numerics. At
larger times however, the eventual convergence is much
slower in ﬁnite dimensions.

O

The curves for Nw(t) and Nd(t) display in all cases a
sharp increase at short times, a maximum for a given time
tmax and then a decay towards the consensus state in
which all the agents share the same unique word, reached
at tconv. The short time regime corresponds to the cre-
ation of many diﬀerent words by the agents. After a time
of order N , each agent has played typically once, and
therefore
(N ) diﬀerent words have been invented (in
fact, typically N/2): the total number of distinct words
in the system grows and reaches a maximum scaling as
N . Due to the interactions, the agents accumulate in
memory the words they have invented and the words
that other agents have invented. In MF, each agent can
interact with all the others, so that it can learn many
diﬀerent words, and in fact the maximal memory neces-
sary for each agent scales as N α
MF with αMF = 0.5 [9], so
N 1.5, with
that the total memory used at the peak is
many words shared by many agents, and tmax ∼
MF
with βMF = 1.5. Moreover, during this learning phase,
words are not eliminated (S(t) is very small) so that the
total number of distinct words displays a long plateau.
The redundancy of words then reaches a suﬃcient level
to begin producing successful interactions and the de-
crease of the number of words is then very fast, with a
rapid convergence to the consensus state.
In contrast
in ﬁnite dimensions words can only spread locally, and
each agent has access only to a ﬁnite number of diﬀerent

thin is however not obvious a priori: an agent having e.g.
two words in memory can propagate them to its neigh-
bors, leading to possible clusters of agents having more
than one word.

In order to rationalize and quantify such evolution, we
consider a single interface between two linear clusters of
agents:
in each cluster, all the agents share the same
unique word, say A in the left-hand cluster and B in the
other. The interface is a string of length m composed of
sites in which both states A and B are present. We call
Cm this state (A + B)m. A C0 corresponds to two di-
), while Cm
rectly neighboring clusters (
· · ·
means that the interface is composed by m sites in the
state C = A + B (
). Note that,
in the actual dynamics, two clusters of states A and B
can be separated by a more complex interface. For in-
stance a Cm interface can break down into two or more
smaller sets of C-states spaced out by A or B clusters,
causing the number of interfaces to grow. Numerical in-
vestigation shows that such conﬁgurations are however
eliminated in the early times of the dynamics.

Bearing in mind these hypotheses, an approximate ex-
pression for the stationary probability that two neigh-
boring clusters are separated by a Cm interface can be
computed in the following way. In a one-dimensional line
composed of N sites and initially divided into two clus-
ters of A and B, the probability to select the unique C0
interface is 1/N , and the interacting rules say that the
only possible product is a C1 interface. Thus, there is
a probability p0,1 = 1/N that a C0 interface becomes a
C1 interface in a single time step, otherwise it stays in
C0. From C1 the interface can evolve into a C0 or a C2
interface with probabilities p1,0 = 3

spectively. This procedure is easily extended to higher
values of m. The numerics suggest that we can safely

Since our analysis shows that the width of the inter-

objects localized around their central position x: in the
previously analyzed case, denoting by xl the position
of the right-most site of cluster A and by xr the po-
sition of the left-most site of cluster B, it is given by
x = xl+xr

These results are conﬁrmed by numerical simulations

tial position, while the mean-square distance reached
by the interface at the time t follows the diﬀusion law

D. The dynami-
h
cal evolution of the Naming Game on a one-dimensional
lattice can then be described as follows: at short times,
pairwise interactions create
(N ) small clusters, divided
O
by thin interfaces (see the ﬁrst lines in Fig.3). We can
estimate the number of interfaces at this time with the
number of diﬀerent words in the lattice, that is about
N/2. The interfaces then start diﬀusing. When two in-
terfaces meet, the cluster situated in between the inter-
faces disappears, and the two interfaces coalesce. Such a
coarsening leads to the well-known growth of the typical
size ξ of the clusters as t1/2. The density of interfaces,
at which unsuccessful interactions can take place, decays
as 1/√t, so that 1
S(t) also decays as 1/√t. Moreover,
starting from a lattice in which all agents have no words,
a time N is needed to reach a size of order 1, so that
t/N (as also shown by the fact that
in fact ξ grows as
the diﬀusion coeﬃcient is D/N ), which explains the time
N 3 needed to reach consensus, i.e. ξ = N .
tconv ∼
This framework can be extended to the case of higher
dimensions. The interfaces, although quite rough, are
well deﬁned and their width does not grow in time, which
points to the existence of an eﬀective surface tension.
The numerical computation of equal-time pair correlation
function in dimension d = 2 (not shown) indicates that

the characteristic length scale ξ grows as

t/N (a time
(N ) is needed to initialize the agents to at least one
O
word and therefore to reach a cluster size of order 1), in
agreement with coarsening dynamics for non-conserved
ﬁelds [10]. Since tconv corresponds to the time needed
N 1+2/d, that
to reach ξ = N 1/d, we can argue tconv ∼
has been veriﬁed by numerical simulations in d = 2 and
d = 3. This scaling and the observed coarsening behavior
suggest that the upper critical dimension for this system
is d = 4 [10].

In conclusion, the study of the low-dimensional Nam-
ing Game using statistical physics methods provides a
deeper understanding of the macroscopical collective dy-
namics of the model. We have shown how it presents a
very diﬀerent behavior in low-dimensional lattices than
in mean-ﬁeld, indicating the existence of a ﬁnite upper-
critical dimension. Low-dimensional dynamics is initially
more eﬀective, less memory per node is required, pre-
venting agents from learning a large part of the many
diﬀerent words created. The dynamics then proceeds by
the growth of clusters by coarsening, yielding a slow con-
vergence to consensus. In contrast with other models of
the Voter model [11, 12]), the
opinion dynamics (e.g.
Naming Game presents an eﬀective surface tension that
is reminiscent of the non-equilibrium zero-temperature
Ising model [10].
In this respect, it seems interesting
to investigate the dynamics of the Naming Game in
other topologies, such as complex networks in which each
node have a ﬁnite number of neighbors combined with
”long-range” links [13]. Acknowledgments: The au-

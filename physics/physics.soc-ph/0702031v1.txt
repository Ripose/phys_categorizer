Abstract: Using the Schulze model for Monte Carlo simulations of language
competition, we include a barrier between the top half and the bottom half of
the lattice. We check under which conditions two diﬀerent languages evolve as
dominating in the two halves.

Keywords: Monte Carlo simulation, geography, separation.

Introduction

Languages are inﬂuenced by natural barriers [1], like mountains [2], water or politics
[3]. On diﬀerent sides of a mountain ridge diﬀerent dialects or languages may be
spoken, and the same separation happened on the two sides of the English Channel
[4]. Our previous attempt [5] to simulate this eﬀect with the Viviane model [6]
of language competition [7, 8, 9, 10] was unsuccessful. Thus we now try to use
the Schulze model [11, 5] to check under which conditions one barrier leads to the
domination of two diﬀerent languages on the two sides of the barrier.

In the next section we deﬁne the model, section III gives some of our results,

and section IV summarises our work.

2 Model

Each site of a L × L square lattice is occupied by one adult person speaking one
language (dialect, grammar, ...). Each such language is deﬁned by F diﬀerent fea-
tures each of which can take one of Q diﬀerent values. Thus we have in total QF
diﬀerent possible languages. We use Q = 3 and 5 and F = 8 and 16. Changes in
the languages are ruled by two probabilities p and q. At each time step (one sweep

1

through the lattice) each language can change into another one by changing each of
its F features independently with probability p. This change means that with prob-
ability 1 − q a random value between 1 and Q is selected, while with probability q
we accept the corresponding language element from one of the four neighbours, ran-
domly selected. Thus q means linguistic diﬀusion, while p corresponds to biologial
mutations.

Also, in contrast to biology, humans shift away from small to large languages
in order to be able to communicate better. Thus with probability (1 − x)2 at each
iteration each person selects the whole language of one randomly selected lattice
neighbour and gives up the old language. Here x is the fraction of others speaking
the same language as the old language. Normally this fraction was counted for the
whole population, but now we calculate it from the four nearest neighbours. We
assume a horizontal barrier separating the upper half of the lattice from its lower
half. Then we disallow this shift to another language if that language comes from
the other side of the barrier, except that with a low crossing probability c we may
shift also to a language spoken on the other side. (The above transfer q is always
allowed also from the other side.)

Since now we calculate x from the neighbourhood only and not from the whole
population we have checked that again, as with earlier versions [11, 5], for small q
and large p the population fragments into numerous languages even if we start with
everybody speaking the same language. And starting from a fragmented population
we get dominance of one language, spoken by more than half of the population, if
we use small p, large q and not too large L.

3 Results

Without any barrier, Fig.1 shows how “mutations” destroy the initial order if we
start with everybody speaking the same language. Thus Fig.2 later will use a low
probability p = 0.05 and a high q = 0.9 to facilitate the emergence of dominating
languages when initially everybody selects randomly a language. In Fig.1 we start
on the left with a small p and then increase p in steps of 0.01. The observation
time is t = 1000, and every 100 time steps the fraction of people speaking the most
widespread language is shown in Fig.1. Thus we see how for low p this order param-
eter, the largest fraction, stabilises to a value slightly below one, while for larger p
it decays to about zero. (For clarity Fig.1 is presented as one curve for diﬀerent p,
as if we would have started the simulation of a new p with the ﬁnal population of
the previous p. Actually, we started for each p with everybody speaking the same
language. Thus in the top part of Fig.1 the ﬁrst plateau corresponds to p = 0.10,
the second to 0.11, the third to 0.12, followed by a decay at 0.13.)

Now we include the barrier which can be crossed with a low probability c. We
call the situation stable if starting from random fragmentation, the most widespread
language is spoken at the end of our observation time t by nearly half the population;
then usually another language is spoken by most of the other half. Due to the
coupling between the two lattice parts, arising from the probabilities q and c, it

may also happen, that after some time the same language dominates in both parts
of the lattice; this case we call unstable since we are interested in the coexistence
of two languages, each dominating in its half of the lattice.

It may happen that for the same set of probabilities, some random numbers give
stable and some unstable language distributions. Thus we look at ten samples and
reach the transition point when ﬁve samples are stable and ﬁve are unstable. Fig.2
shows the transitions: Number of stable samples among the ten simulated samples.
We see a rather broad transition where that number decreases from (nearly) ten to
(nearly) 0. And small lattices (L = 50) diﬀer strongly from larger ones (L = 100).
Unfortunately, our changes to pure local interactions require long observation times
near 105 since for shorter times the order parameter (fraction of people speaking
the largest language) may not yet have grown suﬃciently. Thus, our lattices in

creasing crossing probability c, for p = 0.05, q = 0.9 and the other param-
eters as shown in the headline. The x symbols refer to Q = 5 instead of 3,
at L = 100. For F = 16 instead of 8, the transition is near c ≃ 0.006 at
L = 100 (not shown). Stability is very rare for larger crossing rates than
shown here.

Fig.2 are much smaller than in Fig.1.

Finally, Fig.3 shows our results for q = 0.7 instead of 0.9. Now we are closer
to the case where ordering is impossible (the fragmented population remains frag-
mented for q < 0.42) even at c = 0. Thus the results are less clear but still show
that the transitions are at much smaller c than in Fig.2.

4 Summary

For low enough crossing probabilities c we found stability of one language dominat-
ing on one side of the barrier and another language dominating on the other side,
in a variant of the Schulze model. Earlier, we were unable to get such a seemingly
trivial result in the Viviane model [6, 5]. The Tuncay models contain no geogra-

phy. Since we are not aware of other models for the competition of thousands of
languages, our model is the ﬁrst known to us which allows for the stability of two
diﬀerent languages on diﬀerent sides of a barrier. One now could apply this method
to islands, i.e. to sections of the lattice surrounded by barriers on all four sides [12].
Since Fig.2 shows clear size eﬀects, we then expect the transitions to happen at
probabilities c which are smaller for larger islands.

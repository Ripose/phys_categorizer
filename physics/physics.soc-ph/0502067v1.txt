Abstrat

The population dynamis underlying the di(cid:27)usion of ideas hold many qualitative

similarities to those involved in the spread of infetions. In spite of muh suggestive

evidene this analogy is hardly ever quanti(cid:28)ed in useful ways. The standard bene(cid:28)t

of modeling epidemis is the ability to estimate quantitatively population average pa-

rameters, suh as interpersonal ontat rates, inubation times, duration of infetious

periods, et. In most ases suh quantities generalize naturally to the spread of ideas

and provide a simple means of quantifying soiologial and behavioral patterns. Here

we apply several paradigmati models of epidemis to empirial data on the advent and

spread of Feynman diagrams through the theoretial physis ommunities of the USA,

Japan, and the USSR in the period immediately after World War II. This test ase has

the advantage of having been studied historially in great detail, whih allows valida-

tion of our results. We estimate the e(cid:27)etiveness of adoption of the idea in the three

ommunities and (cid:28)nd values for parameters re(cid:29)eting both intentional soial organiza-

tion and long lifetimes for the idea. These features are probably general harateristis

of the spread of ideas, but not of ommon epidemis.

Introdution

Dynamial population models are used to predit average behavior, generate hypothe-

ses or explore mehanisms aross many (cid:28)elds of siene inluding eology [1, 2, 3℄,

epidemiology [4, 5, 6, 7℄ and immunology [8℄, to name but a few. Traditionally, epi-

demiologial models fous on the dynamis of (cid:16)traits(cid:17) transmitted between individuals,

ommunities, or regions (within spei(cid:28) temporal or spatial sales). Traits may inlude

(i) a ommuniable disease suh as measles [1℄ or HIV [9℄; (ii) a ultural harateristi

suh us a religious belief, a fad [10, 11, 12, 13℄, an innovation [14℄, or fanati behav-

ior [15℄; (iii) an addition suh us drug use [16℄ or a disorder [17℄; or (iv) information

spread through, e.g., rumors [18, 19℄, email messages [20℄, weblogs [21℄, or peer-to-peer

omputer networks [22℄.

The earliest and by now most thoroughly studied population models are those used

to map disease progression through a human population [23, 24, 25℄. These models

typially divide a population into lasses that re(cid:29)et the epidemiologial status of in-

dividuals (e.g. suseptible, exposed, infeted, et), who in turn transit between lasses

via mutual ontat at given average rates. In this way the models an apture average

disease progression by traking the mean number of people who are infeted, who are

prone to ath the disease, and who have reovered over time. In addition, these mod-

els an be used to identify the role of spei(cid:28) population harateristis suh as age,

variable infetivity, and variable infetious periods [24℄. The division of epidemiologi-

al lasses aording to suh harateristis gives rise to more omplex models with so

alled heterogeneous mixing.

In this paper we apply models similar to those used in epidemiology to the spread of

ideas. By the term (cid:16)idea(cid:17) we refer generally to any onept that an be transmitted from

person to person [26, 27, 28, 29℄. It may refer to a tehnology, whih may require e(cid:27)ort

and apprentieship to be learned, but it may also be a more (cid:28)kle piee of information

suh as a olloquialism or a piee of news. What is important is that it is possible to

tell if someone has adopted the idea, understands and remembers it, and is apable of

and/or ative in spreading it to others.

Pioneering ontributions to the modeling of soial ontagion proesses, based on

epidemiologial models, date bak to 1953 [18℄. Nearly a deade later, a stohasti

model for the spread of rumors was proposed and analyzed [19℄. In this later model, a

losed population is divided into three (cid:16)soial(cid:17) states: ignorant, spreaders, and sti(cid:29)ers.

Transitions from the ignorant state to spreaders may result from ontats between the

two lasses, whereas enounters between individuals who already know the rumor may

lead to its essation. Various reent extensions of this model inlude a general lass

of Markov proesses for generating time-dependent evolution [30℄, and studies of the

e(cid:27)ets of soial landsapes on the spread, either through Monte Carlo simulations over

small-world [31℄ and sale-free [32℄ networks, or by derivation of mean-(cid:28)eld equations for

a population with heterogeneous ignorant and spreader lasses [33℄. Despite this revival

in the modeling of information spread, none of these models has been diretly applied to

empirial data. In our opinion, this onstitutes a serious gap in the literature, beause

only the analysis of real data an ultimately validate model assumptions or point to

novel features of suh a omplex proess. The main ob jetive of this paper is to bridge

this gap.

Beyond obvious qualitative parallels there are also important di(cid:27)erenes between

the spread of ideas and diseases. The spread of an idea, unlike a disease, is usually a

3

onsious at on the part of the transmitter and/or the adopter. Some ideas that take

time to mature, suh as those requiring apprentieship or study, require ative e(cid:27)ort to

aquire. There is also no simple automati mehanism (cid:21) suh as an immune system (cid:21) by

means of whih an idea may be leared from an infeted individual. Most importantly,

it is usually advantageous to aquire new ideas, whereas this is manifestly not so for

diseases. This leads people to adopt di(cid:27)erent, often opposite, behaviors when interested

in learning an idea ompared to what they may do during an epidemi outbreak. Thus

we should expet important qualitative and quantitative di(cid:27)erenes between ideas and

diseases when using epidemiologial models in a soiologial ontext. We explore some

of these points below in greater detail, in the ontext of spei(cid:28) models and data.

In spite of these di(cid:27)erenes, quantifying how ideas spread is very desirable as a means

of testing soiologial hypotheses. For example, we an apply dynamial population

models to the spread of an idea to validate statements about how e(cid:27)etively it is

transmitted, the size of the suseptible population, the speed of its spread, as well as

its persistene. Estimating the population numbers and rates is useful in onstraining

explanatory frameworks. It is also useful for studying how ultural environments may

a(cid:27)et adoption, as happens when the same idea is presented to ommunities in di(cid:27)erent

nations, or onversely when di(cid:27)erent ideas are presented to the same ommunity.

We pursue these goals in this paper by applying several generi models of epidemi-

ology to the di(cid:27)usion of a spei(cid:28) sienti(cid:28) idea in three di(cid:27)erent ommunities. Our

test ase is the spread of Feynman diagrams, sine the late 1940s the prinipal om-

putational tool of theoretial high-energy physis, and later also used extensively in

other areas of many-body theory suh as atomi physis and ondensed-matter theory.

The primary reason to hoose this example is that we have detailed historial informa-

tion about the network of ontats, person by person, by means of whih the diagrams

spread during the (cid:28)rst six years after their introdution [34, 35, 36℄.

This example of the spread of an idea may not transend automatially to other ases

of idea di(cid:27)usion. Feynman diagrams are primarily a tool for omplex alulation. As

suh their study and assimilation require a period of apprentieship and familiarization.

Transmission of the tehnique almost invariably proeeded, in the early years, through

personal ontat, from informal teaher to student and among peer groups of users.

In later years the idea beame familiar and available in aessible forms so that (in

priniple) it ould more easily have been learned from books and leture notes. Thus,

although our example will learly not over every lass of ideas it will point, we believe,

to features of epidemi models that apply to idea di(cid:27)usion. It will also reveal features

of these models that require modi(cid:28)ation, thereby produing more realisti andidate

models that we expet will prove useful beyond our present analysis.

In Setion 2 we give some historial bakground on the spread of Feynman diagrams

in the United States, Japan, and the Soviet Union. We disuss our data soures and the

organization of the datasets. Setion 3 presents several lasses of models of epidemi-

ology (or diretly inspired by them), some of their mathematial properties, and the

irumstanes under whih we expet them to apply to the spread of ideas. We apply

eah model to the historial data in Setion 4, and disuss the estimated values for

the model parameters in the light of our independent knowledge of how the diagrams

spread. Finally in Setion 5 we present our onlusions and give some outlook on the

general population modeling of the spread of ideas. Appendix A ontains details about

our parameter estimation proedure.

2 Data soures, time series reonstrution, and

state determination

Feynman diagrams oupy a entral role in modern theoretial physis. Realisti mod-

els of high-energy physis, as well as in ondensed-matter, atomi, and nulear physis

annot be solved exatly to generate preditions that an be onfronted with experi-

ments. In speial irumstanes, however, suh as when interations are weak, series

expansions in a small parameter permit very good systemati approximations.

In models of partile physis, suh as the relativisti quantum theory of eletro-

magnetism (cid:21) quantum eletrodynamis (cid:21) most terms of this series beyond zeroth order

(tree level) are formally in(cid:28)nite. The proedure of removing unphysial in(cid:28)nities to

generate preditions is alled (cid:16)renormalization.(cid:17) It is vital for renormalization to work

that ommensurate terms be grouped together. This is a relatively simple proedure for

the lowest orders in the expansion series but beomes absolutely onfounding at higher

orders, in whih many terms ontribute and in(cid:28)nities must anel preisely between

them. For example, in quantum eletrodynamis, seond-order alulations (involving

the (cid:28)rst non-trivial orretions within the perturbative expansion) typially involve ten

or so distint terms to be delimited, alulated, and added together, while eighth-order

alulations involve nearly one thousand suh terms. Both hallenges to making al-

ulations in quantum eletrodynamis (cid:21) the presene of in(cid:28)nities and the aounting

di(cid:30)ulties of perturbative alulations (cid:21) were well known to physiists during the 1930s,

and the problems remained unsolved after World War II. Throughout 1947 and 1948

several approahes to rendering quantum eletrodynamis well-de(cid:28)ned were being at-

tempted in the USA and Japan, but it remained unlear if any renormalization program

ould sueed systematially [38℄.

It was then that Freeman Dyson, following up on an idea by Rihard Feynman, was

able to show how a diagrammati representation of partile interations ould be used

to organize the series expansion. Using the diagrams, Dyson further demonstrated that

the in(cid:28)nities ould be systematially identi(cid:28)ed and anelled to any perturbative order.

This oneptual breakthrough uni(cid:28)ed Feynman's approah (then at Cornell University)

with that of Julian Shwinger (at Harvard University) and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga (at Tokyo

Eduation University). For their ontributions Feynman, Shwinger, and Tomonaga

were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1965 [38℄. Feynman diagrams opened the (cid:29)oodgates

for omputation (and predition) in quantum eletrodynamis and beyond, reating

enormous researh opportunities for a new generation of theoretial physiists. Tests

of quantum eletrodynamis and later quantum (cid:28)eld theories of the weak and strong

nulear interations ontinue today in multibillion-dollar partile aelerators at CERN

and Fermilab, as well as at smaller installations. These quantum (cid:28)eld theories taken

together onstitute the (cid:16)standard model of partile physis,(cid:17) whih summarizes our

most fundamental (and most exat) understanding of matter and radiation to date.

Almost all quantitative preditions of the standard model, on whih modern partile

physis and osmology are based, are omputed using series of Feynman diagrams.

Beause of their extraordinary importane in enabling a good part of modern the-

oretial physis, the advent of quantum eletrodynamis and of Feynman diagrams in

partiular has been very well doumented. Our data was olleted in large part for

a new book by one of the authors [34℄. For the United States and Britain one of us

(Kaiser) reonstruted the network of ontats (cid:21) author by author (cid:21) for the spread of

5

the diagrams during the (cid:28)rst six years after their introdution, between 1949 and 1954.

For this he relied upon unpublished orrespondene, preprints, leture notes, and publi-

ations from the period, along with more reent interviews and published reolletions.

With the aid of two olleagues, he used similar materials to study how the diagrams

spread to young physiists in Japan and the Soviet Union. Although less information is

readily available about these ommunities of physiists, a reasonably omplete piture

of ontats and spread an also be inferred [34, 35℄.

Based on this information we identify adopters of the idea (or members of the

(cid:16)infeted(cid:17) lass) based on published uses of (or disussion of ) Feynman diagrams in the

main physis researh journals of eah ountry: Physial Review in the USA, Progress

in Theoretial Physis in Japan, and Zhurnal Eksperimental'noi i Teoretiheskoi Fiziki

(Journal of Experimental and Theoretial Physis) in the USSR. The identi(cid:28)ation of

adopters with published authors an learly lead to underestimation. Similarly the

identi(cid:28)ation of national ommunities with spei(cid:28) journal publiation is imperfet,

although we (cid:28)nd almost no ross-national publiations apart from a few British authors

who were in ative ontat with developments in the USA and published in the Physial

Review. As suh they are ounted as part of the diagram-using ommunity in the USA.

With these hoies the evolution of umulative numbers of Feynman-diagram authors

is shown in Fig. 1.

Analogies for the remaining states ommonly used in epidemiologial models are

also natural but must be properly quali(cid:28)ed. The identi(cid:28)ation of suseptibles is usually

problemati both for diseases and ideas. For simpliity one may onsider the entire

population that is not infeted (or reovered), but if the spreading proess requires

suh features as diret ontat with those already infeted this may turn out to be

a gross overestimate. With the bene(cid:28)t of hindsight we an see what fration of the

population atually beame infeted, but suh estimates an learly underestimate the

lass of suseptibles.

Finally it is interesting to disuss the reovered state. For some ommuniable

diseases suh a state does not exist; suh is the ase for HIV and tuberulosis, for

whih infeted individuals remain latent for extensively long periods. On the other

hand, there are infetious diseases in whih an individual aquires immunity right after

reovery and will not get re-infeted. This is not true with ideas, a ase in whih ulture

is manifestly di(cid:27)erent from biology. An idea an reur again and again, whenever it

beomes useful, one it beomes part of an individual's repertoire. In many ases (and

this is lear in our data for several authors), an individual might publish in areas where

Feynman diagrams are used, only to later leave the area for good or to return to it later.

For very proli(cid:28) authors, publiation in several areas simultaneously ours frequently.

With these aveats in mind we proeed in the next setions to apply epidemi models

to our data. Model parameters will be estimated on the basis of how well they (cid:28)t the

evolution of adopters. Furthermore, the results of these estimates will be sub jeted

to broad bounds imposed by the solutions' plausibility, given our knowledge of the

historial fats.

by similar models in epidemis. An individual an be reruited into the suseptible (S )
lass, then be exposed (E ) to the idea, inubate it, and eventually manifest it, beoming
a member of the adopter or infeted lass (I ). An indivdual might instead move into a
ompeting infetive lass (e.g., skeptis, Z ). It is possible that part of the population may
eventually reover (R), meaning that it will not manifest the idea again. Individuals an

also exit any lass, thus reduing the total population.

3 Population models: drawing parallels between

epidemis and idea di(cid:27)usion

Below we shall onentrate on the lassial, simplest epidemiologial models, based on

(cid:16)homogeneous mixing(cid:17) in whih state variables are only funtions of time. In a review

of epidemiologial models Hethote [24℄ introdued their ompartmental harateriza-

tion (e.g. SIR, SIS, SEIR, et.) within a global analysis of the (cid:28)eld. Suh survey

also disusses how more omplex models an be used to asses the impat of population

struture (age, risk, gender, et.), epidemiologial variability (age of infetion, variable

infetivity, distributed inubation periods, et.), and sale (spatial, temporal, et.) on

disease dynamis and ontrol. Although we have knowledge of some population hara-

teristis (e.g. aademi level, institutional loation) in our data set we feel it may not

be large enough to make suh distintions in a way that will lead to useful quantitative

disrimination.

As suh we explore below a large lass of "mean-(cid:28)eld" models, illustrated by Fig. 2.

At the onset of the spread of the idea most of the population will be in the suseptible

lass (S ), with a few individuals in the inubator lass (E ) (cid:21) having been in ontat with
the idea (cid:21) and a small number of adopters (I ) manifesting it. These are the prinipal

lasses in the models below.

In addition, inspired by the approahes of Daley and

Kendall [19℄, we also explore models in whih there may be ompeting and mutually

exlusive ideas (e.g. where suseptibles are turned o(cid:27) from the idea and beome skeptis

or idea sti(cid:29)ers, represented by the lass Z ). Furthermore, individuals may reover or
beome immune (R), and not manifest the idea again. Di(cid:27)erent models ombine subsets

of these states and admit di(cid:27)erent ouplings between them.

In

the epidemi models used in this study, the demographi dynamis are modeled by

dN/dt = B(N ) − µN , where B(N ) is referred to as the reruitment funtion. In our

new graduate students starting in the (cid:28)eld as well as other sientists who (cid:28)nd the idea

relevant for their researh. The parameter µ > 0 denotes the rate at whih physiists

stop using Feynman diagrams (the exit terms in Fig. 2). Thus, the maximum value

that 1/µ an take is the average lifespan of the idea within a generation of researhers

in the relevant ommunity.

end of this setion we emphasize the role of the basi reprodutive number, R0 , as a

measure of e(cid:27)etiveness of adoption.

3.1 Models without inubation: SIR Model

The lassial epidemi model onsists of three states: suseptibles (S ), adopters (or
infeted, I ), and reovered (R).

In this SIR model, suseptible individuals transit

diretly to the adopter lass through ontat with other adopters, without any delay

period or inubation. The reovered state onsists of those individuals who no longer

manifest the idea. This state allows for the deay of adopters by reovery and thus

leads to a regulation of the idea spread. The model is de(cid:28)ned by the following system

of ordinary di(cid:27)erential equations (where overdots denote derivatives with respet to

time):

˙S = Λ − βS I

(1)

where 1/(γ + µ) is the average time spent manifesting the idea as an adopter (γ denotes
the reovery rate from infetion). The term βSI/N is usually referred to as the standard
inidene. The parameter β is the per apita idea adoption rate. It an in turn be

thought as the produt between the mean ontat rate per apita and the probability

of adoption per ontat.

As noted above, although reovery is a natural onept in epidemiology (sine or-

ganisms naturally may beome immune after exposure and/or infetion), there is no

strit parallel when disussing ideas. Loose analogies are possible, e.g. one one loses

interest in an idea it is usually harder to have an individual express it, whereas novelty

may make it more attrative. Nevertheless there is no systemati ognitive proess,

analogous to the immune system, that atively lears out ideas. As suh many ideas

are remembered for life.

Many ideas may be short-lived, say from years to days, ompared to the lifetime of

the individual. In this ase, we may onsider a single outbreak by setting Λ = µ = 0.

The sign of the right hand side of the seond equation in system (1) then determines

the spread of the idea and depends on the initial fration of suseptibles, S(t0)/N . If
the initial state of the population an be suh that S(t0)/N < γ/β , then the number

of infetives an only derease. This is the basis of immunization ampaigns, whereby

members of the suseptible lass are turned into members of the immune lass, and

hene beome part of R(t0). Thus knowledge of the infetion rate, β , and of the
lifetime of the infetion, 1/γ , results in the reommendation for the fration of immune
(reovered) neessary for an epidemi not to develop, namely R(t0)/N > 1 − (γ/β).
For a very infetious disease or idea (large β ) or one with a slow reovery rate (small
γ ) almost all of the population must be immune in order to halt the spread.

Due to the less lear de(cid:28)nition of immunity to an idea, the onept of what may

onstitute immunization is also ill-de(cid:28)ned. Clearly the novelty of an idea and a per-

eption of its potential are often its most attrative features. Changing this pereption

through eduation (e.g., about the onsequenes of a ertain behavior, ideology, or pra-

tie) may lead to an inrease of skeptiism and onsequently greater (cid:16)immunity(cid:17) upon

exposure. Moreover we should keep in mind that this onept of immunization, just

as in standard epidemis but for di(cid:27)erent reasons, is usually only valid for the lifetime

of an individual. Although some biologial immunity an be passed e.g. from mother

to infant, it is usually the ase that young individuals are more suseptible to new dis-

eases and ideas alike. In the Feynman diagram ase this is borne out historially: over

80 perent of the early adopters of the diagrams in eah ountry were either graduate

students or postdos when they (cid:28)rst began using the diagrams; older physiists simply

did not re-tool [34℄.

The asymptoti late-time dynamis of model (1) are well known, and will form the

basis for the analyses of more omplex models disussed below. Suppose that Λ > 0 and
µ > 0. For long times, and regardless of the distribution of infetives and suseptibles,
reruitment and exits will balane eah other so that limt→∞ N (t) = N ∗ = Λ/µ. There

are up to two di(cid:27)erent non-negative steady states ((cid:28)xed points), known in epidemiology

as the disease-free equilibrium with S∗ = N ∗ = Λ/µ, I ∗ = R∗ = 0, and the endemi
state (whenever β/(γ + µ) > 1) with

The eigenvalues around the disease-free state equilibrium are (−µ, −µ, β − (γ + µ)).

if the deay rate (due to exit and

reovery) is larger than the idea adoption rate. The instability of the disease-free state

orresponds to stability of the endemi state. The eigenvalues of the linearized system

in a population of suseptibles (assumed to be at a demographi steady state). We will

disuss the role of R0 further in Subsetion 3.3.

3.2 Competition and inubation: SIZ and SEIZ Models

In the spread of ideas, but almost never in standard epidemis, the exposure of indi-

viduals to an idea almost invariably leads to both enthusiasts and skeptis. In the ase

of Feynman diagrams, skeptis did indeed emerge. Julian Shwinger, for example, who

developed a non-diagrammati method of renormalization, quipped years later that

Feynman diagrams had (cid:16)brought omputation to the masses(cid:17) (cid:21) hardly a good thing, as

far as Shwinger was onerned. Although his graduate students at Harvard did learn

something about the diagrams, they made little use of them in their dissertations and

early artiles. J. R. Oppenheimer, too, was initially skeptial, and e(cid:27)etively bloked

Dyson's reruitment e(cid:27)orts at the Institute for Advaned Study in Prineton for several

weeks, before Hans Bethe intereded diretly on Dyson's behalf. In Mosow, meanwhile,

the in(cid:29)uential Lev Landau made his distaste for Feynman diagrams lear during the

early 1950s, bloking any disussion of them in his famous seminar (even hastising

one young graduate student who had expressed interest in the diagrams that it would

be (cid:16)immoral(cid:17) to hase suh (cid:16)fashions(cid:17) as Feynman diagrams!) [34℄. Thus inlusion of

skeptis alongside enthusiasts is quite important. This an be modeled by onsidering

two ompeting and mutually exlusive infeted states, say I and Z . The simplest suh

model (SIZ) is given by

˙S = Λ − βS I
N

− bS Z
N

− µS





˙I = βS I
N

˙Z = bS Z
N

− µZ,

(4)

where b and β denote the per apita rates of idea rejetion and adoption by suseptibles,

respetively.

The interesting new feature about this type of model is that it an support up to

three (cid:28)xed points. The (cid:28)rst is the usual disease-free state S = N ∗ = Λ/µ, I = 0, Z = 0

11

(extintion of both adopters and skeptis), and two endemi states, one for eah strand

I , Z :

or

gives

S = µ

1 − µ

b

N ∗, I = 0 (extintion of adopters).

(cid:16)

(cid:0)

(cid:17)

(cid:1)

Observe that model (4) does not support the steady state o-existene of adopters

and skeptis. For the disease-free state the eigenvalues are (b − µ, β − µ, −µ). Thus
for stability one needs both b < µ and β < µ. This means that there are two R0 's,
RI

0 = β/µ, and RZ

0 = b/µ.

Under these irumstanes, whih of the endemi states beomes stable? To in-

vestigate this question we inspet the eigenvalues around the I endemi state. This

− µ,

b
β

(cid:18)

− 1

µ,

(cid:19)

−β + µ.

Similarly we obtain the eigenvalues for the endemi Z state by replaing b with β and

vie versa in (7). This result implies that only one of the two endemi states an be

stable, depending on the relative magnitude of the ontat rates b and β . We note,
however, that beause there is no ontat term between the I and Z , the way one lass

ends up dominating relies on long-time hanges in the population through yles of

reruitment and exit. This time sale an be very long, diverging in the limit where

b → β . For β > b it will take on average β/(β − b) generations until the disappearane

of skeptis.

The model generalizes immediately to an arbitrary number, nZ , of alternative en-
demi states, Zi (in whih we inlude the usual I ), with assoiated ontat rates bi .
There will then be nZ + 1 (cid:28)xed points, one disease-free and nZ endemi orresponding
to eah strand. As in the SIZ model above only the state with the largest bi will be
loally stable. The stability of the (cid:28)xed point assoiated with Zi for deay in favor of
an alternative state Zj is haraterized by an eigenvalue [(bi/bj) − 1]µ. The disease-free
equilibrium will be loally stable if and only if all Ri

0 = bi/bj < 1, ∀nZ
i=1 .

As above, onsider the ase in whih reovery an take plae in the SIZ model, and

proeeds with rate γI from the I lass, and with rate γZ from the Z lass. RI,Z
by the simple modi(cid:28)ation µ → µ + γI,Z . In the absene of vital dynamis, it then
beomes a neessary and su(cid:30)ient ondition for the growth of the strand I , Z that
S(t0)/N > γI,Z/β , respetively. What is interesting now is that the redution of the

0

hange

suseptibles an be ahieved by having a suitably large fration of the population in the

omplementary infetive strand(s). For example, I will not grow if [Z(t0) + R(t0)]/N >
1−(γI /β). This observation quanti(cid:28)es the fat that in a population with a large fration

of skeptis an idea will not take hold. In this sense omplementary strands e(cid:27)etively

at like reovery states. This may be the most natural explanation for why old ideas

seldom re-surfae, in spite of being preserved for very long times in the population and

various arhives.

One important drawbak of SIR and SIZ models is that one exposed to an infeted

person, a suseptible individual transits immediately to the infeted lass. This feature

is often unrealisti, espeially for ideas that require long periods of apprentieship, whih

is ommon in sienti(cid:28) researh and is a signi(cid:28)ant feature of the Feynman-diagram user

data disussed below. The simplest way of inorporating some delay in an SIZ model

is to introdue a new lass of inubators (or exposed), denoted by E , between the

suseptible and adopter states. Upon ontat with an adopter, a suseptible individual

transits with a given probability to the E lass. This lass has a given harateristi
lifetime, 1/ǫ, before the individual manifests the idea and transits to the I lass. That
is, 1/ǫ is the average inubation (or maturation) time of the idea [39℄. It is expeted

to be a funtion of personal e(cid:27)ort on the part of the adopter as well as environment

(adverse or supportive). There may also be population losses due to vital dynamis,

whih we will ontinue to assume our on a timesale 1/µ. In this sense not all of the

exposed population will beome infeted.

This extension leads to an SEIZ model. In addition, this model an be enrihed

with extra proesses to generate a better desription of the data. Below we present

a version of the SEIZ model in whih skeptis reruit from the suseptible pool with

rate b, but their ation may result either in turning the individual into another skepti
(with probability l), or it may have the unintended e(cid:27)et of sending that person into
the inubator lass (with probability 1 − l). We also introdue a probability, p, that

a suseptible individual will beome immediately infeted with the idea upon ontat.

Conversely, with probability 1−p that person will transit to the inubator lass instead,

from whih the individual may later beome an adopter. Furthermore, the transition of

individuals from the inubator lass to the adopter lass an be promoted by ontat,

with rate ρ. With these hoies the model is given by:

˙E = (1 − p)βS I

3.3 Speed of idea propagation and e(cid:27)etiveness of adoption

From the disussion of the models above we an de(cid:28)ne several important intuitive

quantities that haraterize the spread of ideas. For example, a simple measure of the

speed of propagation of the idea is the number of new adopters per unit time. This is

simply given by

˙I .

growing eigenvalue λ+

simply

For simple models, suh as the ones disussed above, in whih there is only one

for eah infetive strand, the initial veloity of the spread is

vini ≡ ˙I(t0) ≃ λ+I(t0).

(10)

The quantity vini gives a measure of how fast the idea will initially spread but not of

its overall adoption e(cid:27)etiveness. In order to determine the latter we must onsider

the number of new adoptions that a spreader of the idea an lead to during his/her

lifetime. Sine there is no a priori good reason to suspet that ideas are short-lived,

the e(cid:27)etiveness of an idea may result from slow spread over long periods of time and

thus may not be well haraterized by vini .

The number of seondary adoptions indued by a typial idea spreader in a popu-

lation of suseptibles over that person's lifetime as an adopter, tidea , is alled the basi
reprodutive number, R0 , in eology and epidemiology (see [3, 5, 24℄). As suh R0 is

the invasion riterion for adopters in a population of suseptibles, or analogously the

average branhing ratio (the number of o(cid:27)spring) of the typial adopter over his/her

lifetime in this state. If R0 = I(tidea)/I(t0) > 1 then the idea will spread. The greater
R0 the more e(cid:27)etive the idea adoption will be.

In pratie R0 an be omputed in simple models through the linearization of

˙I(t)

around the disease-free equilibrium. These expressions are summarized in Table 3. For

the omputation of R0 in models with heterogeneous populations other methods are

neessary [5, 40, 41℄. In the next setion we will estimate the statistial distributions for

R0 sub jet to (cid:28)tting the data for the spread of Feynman diagrams in the USA, Japan,

and the USSR. The mean of this distribution provides a measure of the e(cid:27)etiveness of

the adoption of Feynman diagrams in the three ountries.

4 Results and disussion

We now analyze the results of estimating parameters by mathing the data on the

spread of Feynman diagrams for three distint ountries to several population models

disussed above. These models allow us to disuss the e(cid:27)ets of the reovered lass, of

mehanisms, both by progression and by ontat between population lasses.

Table 4 summarizes the results. To gauge the appliability of eah model to eah

data set we used the simplest measure of goodness of (cid:28)t, by omputing the absolute

value of the deviation between model predition and data. Average deviations per data

point are shown in Table 4. Details of our ensemble estimation proedure are given in

Appendix A.

Here we note simply that parameter estimation must, by pratial neessity, be

on(cid:28)ned to given numerial ranges, with upper and lower bounds ditated by general

empirial onsiderations. Our hoies of estimation intervals are shown in Table 5.

This proedure is familiar from epidemiology, where knowledge about suh quantities

as the length of inubation and infetious periods is often used to restrit various model

parameters to plausible values (see [42℄; [8℄ also employs assumptions of this nature in

immunology).

4.1 Results for models without inubation: SIR

We start by presenting our results for simple models without inubation. Parameter

estimates are given in Table 6 for the USA, Japan, and the USSR, while the model

solutions are ompared to the data in Fig. 3.

The estimates for the initial population paint a piture of a onsiderably larger

sienti(cid:28) ommunity suseptible to learn Feynman diagrams in the USA than in the

other two ountries. In Japan, S(t0) appears more than three times smaller than in

the USA, while in the Soviet Union our estimates indiate a very small number of

suseptibles around 1952. Nevertheless both the USA and the USSR show strong levels

of reruitment (slightly higher Λ in the USA), as ompared to Japan.

This makes sense given eah ommunity's rates of growth during this time period. In

the postwar United States, the rate at whih new Ph.D.s in physis were granted grew

Figure 4: The probability distribution of the basi reprodutive number R0 estimated from
the SIR model for the USA data on the spread of Feynman diagrams. R0 measures the

e(cid:27)etiveness of the idea adoption. Its value estimates the average number of adopters indued

by a typial spreader in a population of suseptibles.

by nearly twie that of any other (cid:28)eld between 1945 and 1951, quikly exeeding (by a

fator of three) the prewar rate at whih new physiists had been trained. Meanwhile,

building on the wartime Manhattan Pro jet pattern, the federal government pumped

money into physis at more than ten times the prewar levels. Most singled out for

support during the early postwar period was high-energy physis, preisely that branh

of the disipline in whih Feynman diagrams were (cid:28)rst developed and from whih the

earliest adopters ame [37℄. These fators led to a large population of suseptibles when

Feynman and Dyson (cid:28)rst introdued Feynman diagrams.

Japan, on the other hand, had a strong tradition of high-energy physis before

the war, but massive shortages of funding and basi supplies during the early postwar

years hampered the growth of that ountry's physis ommunity (lower Λ). Although

absolute numbers of new physiists in Japan did not grow at anything like the pae in

the United States after World War II, several institutional hanges were introdued in

Japan right around the time that Feynman diagrams were invented, greatly failitating

the diagrams' spread throughout Japan. This fat is re(cid:29)eted in the highest adoption

rate, β , for Japan, ompared to the other two ountries. This in turn leads both to the
fastest speed of adoption and the highest value of R0 .

Contats between Japanese and Amerian physiists began again in 1948 (while

Japan was still under U.S. oupation), inluding visits by several Japanese theoretial

physiists to the Institute for Advaned Study in Prineton, New Jersey, where Free-

man Dyson was honing the new diagrammati tehniques. A new organization in Japan,

known as the Elementary Partile Theory Group, was also founded in 1948, and began

to publish its own informal newsletter and preprint organ, Soryushi-ron Kenkyu, whih

18

helped to spread news of the new diagrammati tehniques. And (cid:28)nally the Japanese

university system quikly expanded tenfold, beginning in 1949, allowing young physi-

ists to establish new groups and visit new institutions throughout the ountry, putting

the new tehniques into rapid irulation [34, 35℄.

The Soviet Union was the only ountry in the world after World War II in whih

the growth in the numbers of new physiists and in government spending on physis

was omparable with the United States. This may explain why our estimates of the

reruitment rates Λ are so high and ommensurate for the two nations. But the onset

of the Cold War in the late 1940s e(cid:27)etively ended all informal ommuniation between

physiists in the USA and USSR just months before Feynman and Dyson introdued

Feynman diagrams.

These geopolitial onstraints severely limited the exhange of information for sev-

eral years and explain why Feynman diagrams took hold in the Soviet Union only later

and at a slower initial pae (smallest vini ). Only with the (cid:16)Atoms for Peae(cid:17) initiatives,

starting in 1955, did physiists from both ountries begin to meet informally for ex-

tended visits. And only after these lengthy fae-to-fae (cid:16)exposures(cid:17) did Soviet physiists

begin to adopt Feynman diagrams at a omparable rate to those in the USA and Japan

[34, 35℄. Over time the e(cid:27)etiveness of adoption, R0 , was nevertheless omparable

between the USSR and the USA.

Finally we notie that both the exit and reovery rates, µ and γ , are small in every
ase, their sum being omparable to a areer lifetime (5-25 years). The fat that γ is
estimated to be smaller that µ is a onsequene of our imposed lower bound on the

exit rate and the fat that the data only onstrains their sum. Although this estimate

annot be made with good on(cid:28)dene for data whih only overs the (cid:28)rst six years, it

is an indiation that ideas are not naturally forgotten.

Inidentally, we do know in some ases that the time to hange researh sub jet

was muh shorter for a few prominent authors. Rihard Feynman was working almost

exlusively on his theory of super(cid:29)uidity by 1953 (although some of his students ontin-

ued to use the diagrams under his supervision), while Freeman Dyson was persuaded to

hange researh diretion, to ondensed-matter theory, at a meeting with Enrio Fermi

also in 1953. (See Dyson's testimony in [43℄; see also [34℄.)

The long exit and reovery times, ombined with (cid:28)nite, plausible values of the

ontat rate β , lead in turn to large values of R0 . The fat that an infeted individual,

when introdued in a population of suseptibles, an lead to many adopters (here 6-50)

is assoiated not with high adoption rate for the idea, β , but rather with a long time
(many years) over whih the idea an be transmitted, 1/(γ + µ). This is a feature that

we will see repeated in more omplex models and that is manifestly di(cid:27)erent between

biologial infetion and the spread of ideas.

4.2 Results for models with Inubation: SEI

We now analyze the e(cid:27)ets of inluding lateny in the models. In the simplest SEI

model, suseptibles transit to an intermediate lass of inubators (E ) upon ontat
with adopters, in whih they remain for a harateristi (cid:16)inubation(cid:17) time 1/ǫ, after

whih they manifest the idea. Note that due to exit proesses the average time spent in

the inubator lass is atually 1/(ǫ + µ), and that some individuals exit the population
and never manifest the idea. In pratie µ will be estimated to be small and the time

spent in the inubators lass is indeed essentially the inubation time. The simplest

Results of the parameter estimates are presented in Table 7.

The most important qualitative di(cid:27)erene, relative to models without lateny, is

that the model an now better (cid:28)t data at early times for the USA and Japan (see

Fig. 5). This aounts for the bulk of the improvements in Table 4.

In both ases

this is made possible in the SEI model beause starting with a number of individuals

in the inubator lass allows a two-stage growth proess for the adopters.

Initially

the inubators are depleted, allowing for a growth of adopters with a negative seond

derivative. This is the main feature of SEI solutions, aounting for their better (cid:28)t of

the data relative to the SIR model. The two-stage proess is a property of the growth

urve for adopters in the USA from the initial time until early 1950, and to a lesser

extent for Japan over the same period, after a slightly later start. The harateristi

This time is longest for the USA, on the order of 10 months, shortest for Japan at

2.3 months, and about 5 months for the USSR, re(cid:29)eting the relative values of the

parameters ǫ and β estimated for the three ountries. Beyond this point in time the

e(cid:27)et of the inubator lass is relatively negligible. For Japan and the USSR, where

ǫ is largest, the lass beomes essentially non-dynamial beyond the initial transient,
with E → βSI/(N ǫ), and as a onsequene the solutions look muh like those of the

SIR model.

In pratie the inubation periods estimated for the three ountries are quite dif-

ferent. For the USA (see Fig. 6), the best (cid:28)t solutions prefer to start in 1949 with a

relatively large number of inubators and an inubation time of order 3-4 years. In

both Japan and the Soviet Union the initial population inluded fewer inubators but

had a onsiderably shorter inubation time, of the order of 5-6 months in Japan and

7-8 months in the USSR. These inubation period estimates for Japan and the Soviet

Union are unexpetedly short, sine most of the papers were authored by graduate

students who took on average a few years of training ((cid:16)inubation(cid:17)) before publishing.

The small values for ǫ thus reveal some limits of the simple SEI model: in partiular,
simple progression to adoption (parameterized by ǫ) does not apture the dynamis

adequately, sine (as we know historially) the role of multiple ontats was important.

We return to this issue below.

Beyond the role played by the inubator lass, we observed the same relative hier-

Mean Incubation Time [years]

Figure 6: Histogram of the mean inubation time 1/ǫ for Feynman diagrams in the USA,

estimated by (cid:28)tting the SEI model to data, see table 7.

arhy of several important quantities among the di(cid:27)erent national ommunities. Japan

had the largest e(cid:27)etiveness of adoption, R0 , whereas both the USA and the USSR
displayed smaller and statistially ommensurate values for R0 . (Data were only ol-

leted for the USA and Japan for the period 1949-54, beause the steep rate of growth

made longer olletion times infeasible. The slow rise of diagram adoption in the USSR,

on the other hand, enouraged us to ollet data for a longer period, 1949-59, making

diret omparisons between late-time behavior in the USA and the USSR di(cid:30)ult.) In

every ase the large values of R0 are essentially due to a long lifetime of the idea, 1/µ,
of 13-40 years. The reruitment rates, Λ, similarly to the SIR estimates, are highest

for the USA, followed by the USSR, re(cid:29)eting these national e(cid:27)orts to inrease the

numbers of new physiists.

In spite of all these qualitative similarities one should also keep in mind that the

numerial values for eah of these parameters are generally di(cid:27)erent between the SIR

and SEI models, and not always statistially ompatible. Thus preferene of one model

over another an be determined via onsideration of the goodness of (cid:28)t (Table 4), but

should also take into onsideration qualitative knowledge of the proesses at play.

(cid:28)ts to data, partiularly in the ase of the USA.

We observed that good solutions (with very similar smallest deviation per point) are

possible with either idea strand I or Z having the largest R0 . In this sense our initial six

years of data annot determine whih idea strand, adopters or skeptis, will eventually

win out over many generation times. In the parameter estimates presented in Table 8

we have restrited the solutions to have RI

0 > RZ

0 , thus limiting the searh spae

to the historially santioned eventual domination of Feynman diagrams over other

tehniques. This does not prelude the skeptis from growing initially in a population

of suseptibles, and we (cid:28)nd in fat that degenerate solutions with and without a growing

number of skeptis are possible.

A novelty of the SEIZ model relative to the SEI is that the progression to adoption

an result from multiple ontats, both while suseptible (parameterized by β ) and while
inubating (parameterized by ρ). For every ountry the fat that p is small and ρ sizable

makes adoption favored and faster through ontat with adopters while inubating,

relative to simple progression as in the SEI model. This may indeed be the ase in

reality sine the learning of Feynman diagrams in the early years was haraterized

by extensive interpersonal ontats at several stages of physiists' apprentieship. We

know of only one ase in all three ountries in whih a few physiists learned about the

diagrams su(cid:30)iently well from artiles or textbooks alone. Pratially every adopter in

all three ountries is known to have interated repeatedly with other adopters before

using the diagrams in their researh [34℄.

We also observe that for the SEIZ model the relative magnitudes of the reruitment

rates for the USA, USSR, and Japan follow the trends observed in simpler models,

while the same is approximately true also for the e(cid:27)etiveness of adoption, R0 . The
estimated probability distribution funtion for RI

0 for Japan in the SEIZ model is shown

5 Conlusions

In this paper we applied several population models, inspired by epidemiology, to the

spread of a sienti(cid:28) idea, Feynman diagrams, in three di(cid:27)erent ommunities under-

going very di(cid:27)erent soial transformations during the middle years of the twentieth

entury. There is always a tradeo(cid:27) between the use of models that inlude more detail

(heterogeneous populations) and highly aggregate simple models with a manageable

number of parameters. Although, a model built under very simplisti assumptions is

expeted to have deep limitations, the use of simple epidemi-type models have had

tremendous suess in the reent past, partly due to their ability to use existing data

to make preditions (treatment for HIV [8℄) or reommendations (ontrol measures for

SARS [42℄). This is the thinking behind the model hoies made above. Moreover given

25

the relative sparsity of quantitative data on soial dynamial proesses at present suh

models may well prove to be the most useful starting points for modeling.

We have found that suitably adapted epidemi models do a good job of (cid:28)tting the

empirial data, provided we allow their parameters to be very di(cid:27)erent from those nor-

mally estimated for standard epidemis. In this sense the spread of Feynman diagrams

appears analogous to a very slowly spreading disease, with harateristi progression

times of years instead of days or weeks. The spread of the diagrams also shows an

enormous e(cid:27)etiveness of adoption due primarily to the very long lifetime of the idea,

rather than to abnormally high ontat rates.

The models give a quanti(cid:28)ation of parameters that are harateristi both of the

idea and of the mixing population in whih it spreads. This allows a more preise dis-

ussion of the soiologial reasons why the idea evolved di(cid:27)erently in distint national

ommunities. The initial veloity of spread of Feynman diagrams was fastest in Japan,

followed by the USA, and slowest in the USSR, probably as a result of geopolitial on-

straints that severely limited aess to the idea and its pratitioners. The e(cid:27)etiveness

of the adoption, enapsulated by R0 , was onsistently largest for Japan, most likely

re(cid:29)eting the high level of organization of its sienti(cid:28) ommunity in the di(cid:30)ult times

that followed the end of World War II. To our knowledge this is the (cid:28)rst time that

basi reprodutive number distributions have been estimated for the spread of an idea.

The USA and the USSR also show high reruitment rates, following the two ountries'

massive investment in nulear and high-energy physis during the early Cold War. In

this study we have done what seems to be yet unommon in epidemiology, namely the

estimation not only of model parameters and their variability, but also of the e(cid:27)etive

population sizes of the ommunities involved.

In the proess of onstruting epidemiologial-type models and estimating their

parameters for the spread of Feynman diagrams, we had to onfront several oneptual

issues onerning why the spread of ideas is or is not analogous to that of a disease.

One interesting aspet of the spread of ideas is the inadequay (or irrelevane) of the

reovered state. In fat many ideas may never be forgotten at all, as that would be in

the worst interest of the adopter. As a result our parameter estimates onsistently (cid:28)nd

very long reovery times, 1/γ . The same holds for the exit rates, 1/µ.

In spite of these slow rates of exit and reovery, individuals ommonly have to

aquire many ideas, and these may in some ases be mutually exlusive, or at least may

adversely a(cid:27)et the adoption of others. We introdued a new lass of simple models with

multiple Z lasses representing these strands. It is a urious, and we believe important

fat that the reruitment of individuals from a lass of suseptibles to other ideas has

the same mathematial e(cid:27)et as vaination against disease. In this sense (cid:16)immunity(cid:17)

to an idea may be obtained either by eduation about its possible impliations (perhaps

analogous to atual immunization), or by distration with other, more easily aquired

onepts embodied by the Z lasses.

We must emphasize that the behavior of individuals when exposed to ideas may be

very di(cid:27)erent, indeed opposite, to what they may do during an epidemi outbreak. First,

people intentionally seek ways to extend the infetious period of an idea, usually by

reording it and storing it in various douments. In this sense the lifetime of an idea an

largely transend that of individuals. Seond, short of vaination the most e(cid:27)etive

strategy to stop a disease epidemi is through isolation, whih redues the ontat

rate. Ideas, unlike diseases, are usually bene(cid:28)ial and thus people's behavior tends to

26

maximize e(cid:27)etive ontats. This pattern an be aptured through the mapping of

the soial network of ontats that underlie the spread of the idea, whih we analyze

elsewhere [36℄. There we show that the ommunities where Feynman diagrams spread

the fastest had reated intentional soial and behavioral strutures that ensured very

e(cid:30)ient ommuniation of sienti(cid:28) knowledge.

We (cid:28)nish by remarking that the SEIZ model, whih inluded both skepti and

inubator lasses, as well as aeleration to adoption from inubation (parameterized

by ρ), aptures most adequately the role of suh lasses in the transmission proess,

sine it yields the best (cid:28)ts (smallest average deviations in Table 4). Nevertheless the

modeling of the spread of ideas disussed above is but a simple ariature of the omplex

soial dynamial proesses involved. Our hope is that this work may bring a new and

hopefully useful quantitative perspetive into the study of the di(cid:27)usion of ideas, by the

simplest means possible.

Appendix A. Ensemble parameter estimation pro-

edure

quanti(cid:28)ation.

Here we give a short desription of our parameter estimation proedure and unertainty

The problem of generating estimates for model parameters desribing the spread of

ideas is the absene of lear quantitative expetations, both onerning whih model

should apply best and what the quantitative value of its parameters should be. As

suh we devised a novel searh method apable of both (cid:28)nding the best (cid:28)t to the data

possible given a hoie of model, but also of produing an ensemble of solutions that

are ompatible with the data within a ertain admissible error.

As a starting point we take the fat that simple population models annot be ex-

peted to give perfet desriptions of the data, resulting in a minimum level of disrep-

any. We hose to parameterize this disrepany by a olletive measure of the average

absolute value of the deviation between the best model predition and eah data point.

This measure allows us to disuss and ompare how good models are at desribing a

spei(cid:28) data set. Our results are given in Table 4.

Seond, we expet in general that data ontains errors, e.g. early underestimation,

false positives, aounting errors. Thus a given level of unertainty in the data will

translate into parameter statistial distributions that are ompatible with those allow-

able deviations. This is a stohasti optimization problem (see, e.g., [44℄ for a general

disussion). Based on this idea we perform an estimation of the joint parameter distri-

bution of model parameters, onditional on a set of allowable deviations at eah datum.

To be spei(cid:28) we an write that the unknown exat data point I E(ti), measured at time

29

(13)

(14)

(15)

(16)

t = ti , an be written in terms of the observed datum I O(ti) and an error ξ(ti) as

I E(ti) = I O(ti) + ξ(ti).

The error ξ(ti) is only known statistially. In order to proeed we must speify a model
for ξ . Here we assumed a simple Gaussian distribution suh that

P [ξ(ti)] = P

I E(ti) − I O(ti)
(cid:3)

(cid:2)

= N e

− ξ2 (ti)

2σ2(ti) ,

where N is the normalization fator and σ(ti) parameterizes the expeted error at time
t = ti .

This expetation for the errors an be translated into a ommensurate (cid:28)tness fun-

tion (analogous to a Hamiltonian in statistial physis) that an in turn be minimized

in order to produe parameter estimates through a searh proedure. For eah model

realization (in terms of a set of parameters S = (S(t = t0), E(t = t0), ..., β, γ, ...)) we

take this funtion to be

H(S) =

Xi

I M (ti) − I O(ti)
(cid:3)
2σ2(ti)

(cid:2)

2

,

whih is an impliit funtion of S . If the model ould generate exat results we ould
then make the natural assoiation I E(ti) → I M (ti). This is usually not the ase, sine

a residual minimal deviation always persists. To aount for this we normalize this

funtion to zero by taking H ′(S) = H − H0 , i.e. by subtrating the minimal value of
H , obtained for the best parameter set.

Given this hoie of H ′

we an produe, in analogy with standard proedures in

statistial physis, a joint probability distribution for model parameters given by

P (S) ∼ e

−H ′

.

This hoie guarantees that all statistial moments are (cid:28)nite. This joint probability

distribution an then be used to ompute any moment of any set of parameters, in-

luding single parameter distribution funtions, and ross-parameter orrelations suh

as ovarianes.

In Setion 4 we show results for the single parameter averages and

their standard deviations. We also show some single parameter probability distribution

funtions.

In general the estimation of this probability distribution an be obtained by ran-

domly generating many model parameter sets and weighing them aording to Eq. (16).

The proedure is slightly ompliated beause we are dealing with an inverse problem

in whih, given a trial set of parameters, omparison with the data is performed only

after the non-linear model dynamial equations have been solved. Fortunately for mod-

els that onsist of small numbers of ordinary di(cid:27)erential equations the omputational

e(cid:27)ort is not prohibitive.

In pratie we used an ensemble of trial solutions, from whih we selet a number

of best strings, aording to a standard Monte Carlo proedure, weighted by Eq. (16),

to generate the next generation of the ensemble. In order to do this we introdue a

mutation implemented in terms of random Gaussian noise around the best parameter

sets. This yields an e(cid:27)etive minimization method, apable of exploring large regions

of parameter spae. It also reates as a byprodut an ensemble of good strings with

30

small deviations to the data. For small enough deviations from the best string we an

sample parameter spae in an unbiased manner. It is this ensemble, and its best string,

that is then used to estimate Eq. (16). Results given in Setion 4 involve ensembles

with several million realizations and a hoie of σ , ommon to all points, orresponding
to 10% deviation between the best parameter estimate and other ensemble members.

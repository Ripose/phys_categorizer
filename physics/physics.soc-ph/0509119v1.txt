We describe collaboration networks consisting of research projects funded by the European Union
and the organizations involved in those projects. The networks are of substantial size and complexity,
but are important to understand due to the signiﬁcant impact they could have on research policies
and national economies in the EU. In empirical determinations of the network properties, we observe
characteristics similar to other collaboration networks, including scale-free degree distributions,
small diameter, and high clustering. We present some plausible models for the formation and
structure of networks with the observed properties.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Real world network analysis has become a major issue of research in the last years. Most prominent are perhaps the
investigations of the structure of the World Wide Web, the network of internet routers, and certain social networks
like citation networks. On the theoretical side, one tries to understand the mechanisms of formation of such networks
and to derive statistical properties of the networks from the generating rules. On the rigorous mathematical side,
there are only a few results for speciﬁc models, indicating the diﬃculty of a purely mathematical approach (for a
survey of recent results in this direction, see [7]). Thus, the main approach is to use some mean ﬁeld assumption to
get relevant information about the corresponding graphs. Although it is not clear where the limits of this approach
lie, in many cases the results match well with numerical simulations and empirical data.

In this article, we study a particular collaboration network.

Its vertices are research projects funded by the
European Union and the organizations involved in those projects. In total, the data base contains over 20000 projects
and 35000 participating organizations. The network shows all the main characteristics known from other complex
network structures, such as scale-free degree distribution, small diameter, high clustering, and inhomogeneous vertex
correlations.

Besides the general interest in studying a new, real-world network of large size and high complexity, the study
could have a signiﬁcant economic impact. Improving collaboration between actors involved in innovation processes
is a key objective of current science, technology, and innovation policy in industrialized countries. However, very
little is known about what kind of network structures emerge from such initiatives. Moreover, it is quite likely that
network structure aﬀects network functions such as knowledge creation, knowledge diﬀusion, and the collaboration of
particular types of actors. Presumably, this is determined by both endogenous formation mechanisms and exogenous
framework conditions. In order to progress in our understanding, it is therefore essential to have sound statistics on
the structure of networks we observe and to develop plausible models of how these are formed and evolve over time.
The model networks we use to compare with the empirical data are random intersection graphs, a natural framework
for describing projections of bipartite graphs. Discrete intersection graphs similar to the ones we use were ﬁrst discussed
in [8]. We extend and reﬁne the construction from [8] to be more applicable to real world graphs.

In section II, we describe the preparation of the data on the EU research programs. We present empirical de-
termination of the network properties in section III, followed by an explanation of these properties using a random
intersection graph model in section IV. Finally, in section V, we summarize the key results and consider implications
of the network properties on EU research programs.

II. THE DATA SET

In this work, we study research collaboration networks that have emerged in the European Union’s ﬁrst four
successive four-year Framework Programs (FPs) on Research and Technological Development. Since their inception
in 1984, six FPs have been launched, on four of which we have comprehensive data. FPs are organized in priority
areas, which include information and communication technologies (ICTs), energy, industrial technologies, life sciences,

2

environment, transportation, and a number of additional activities. In line with economic structural change, the main
thematic focus of the FPs has shifted somewhat over time from energy and industrial technologies to the application
of ICTs and life sciences. The majority of funding activities are aimed at stimulating research partnerships between
ﬁrms, universities, research organizations, governmental actors, NGOs, lobby groups, etc.. Since FP4, the scope of
activities has been expanded to also cover training, networking, demonstration, and preparatory activities (for details,
see reference [1]). In order to keep our data set compatible over the diﬀerent FPs, we have excluded the latter set of
projects from FP4 and only focus on collaborative research projects (see table I).

In order to receive funding, projects in FP1 to FP4 had to comprise at least two organizations from at least two
member states. We have retrieved data on these projects from the publicly available CORDIS (Community Research
and Development Information Service) projects database [10]. This database contains information on all funded
projects as well as a reasonably complete listing of all participating organizations.

The raw data on participating organizations is rather inconsistent. Apart from incoherent spelling in up to four
languages per country, organizations are labelled inhomogeneously. Entries may range from large corporate groupings,
such as Siemens, or large public research organizations like the Spanish CSIC to individual departments or labs and
are listed as valid at the time the respective project was carried out. Among heterogeneous organizations, only a
subset contains information on the unit actually participating or on geographical location (address, city, region and/or
country). Information on older entries and the substructure of ﬁrms tends to be less complete.

Because of these diﬃculties, any automatic standardization method akin to the one utilized by Newman [9] is
inappropriate to this kind of data. Rather, the raw data has to be cleaned and completed manually, which is an
ongoing project at ARC systems research. The objective of this work is to produce a data set useful for policy advice by
identifying homogeneous, economically meaningful organizational entities. To this end, organizational boundaries are
deﬁned by legal control and entries are assigned to the respective organizations. Resulting heterogeneous organizations,
such as universities, large research centres, or conglomerate ﬁrms are broken down into subentities that operate in
fairly coherent areas of activity, such as faculties, institutes, divisions or subsidiaries. These can be identiﬁed for
a large number of entries, based on the available contact information of participants, and are comparable across
organizations.

The case of the French Centre National de la Recherche Scientiﬁque (CNRS), the most active participant in the
EU FPs may serve as an illustration. First, 785 separate entries were summarized under a unique organizational
label. Next, these 785 entries were broken down into the eight areas of research activity in which CNRS is currently
organized. Based on available information on participating units and geographical location, 732 of the 785 entries
could be assigned to one of these subentities. For the remaining 53 entries, the nonspeciﬁc label CNRS was used.

Comparable success rates were achieved for other large public research organizations and universities. Due to
scarcer information, ﬁrms could not be broken down at a comparable rate. Moreover, due to resource constraints,
standardization work has focused on the major players in the FPs. Organizations participating in fewer than a total
of 30 projects in FP1–4 have not been broken down yet. Due to these limitations in processing the data, we cannot
rule out the possibility of a bias in analysing our data. However, we have run all the reported analyses with the
undivided organizations and have obtained qualitatively similar results, apart from diﬀerent extreme values, e.g.,
maximum degree.

Table I displays information on the present data set, which contains information on a total of 27,758 projects, carried
out over the period 1984 to 2004. It shows that the total budget as well as number of funded projects has increased
dramatically from FP1 to FP4. Moreover, it provides a rough measure on the completeness of the available data. For
a sizeable number of projects, the CORDIS project database lists information only on the project co-ordinator. This
is due to the age of the data and inhomogeneous disclosure policies of diﬀerent units at the European Commission.
Comparing the number of projects containing information on more than one participant with the total number of
projects funded in each FP shows that the data is fairly complete as of FP2.

The fact that FP1 was the ﬁrst program launched and that the available data are rather incomplete make it
exceptional in many respects. We therefore focus our analyses on FP2–4 and only give graph characteristic values for
FP1 to indicate the diﬀerence to the networks created by the subsequent FPs.

III. THE NETWORK STRUCTURE

In this section, we present the basic properties of the network structure for projects and organizations in the ﬁrst
four EU Framework Programs. We consider both graphs as intersection graphs, each being the dual of the other,
which, for our purposes, is generally more convenient than the usual bipartite-graph point of view. Recall that an
intersection graph is given by an enumerated collection of sets—the vertices of the intersection graph—with elements
from a given ﬁxed base-set and edges deﬁned via the intersection property (edge , nonempty intersection of two sets).
The sets need not be distinct.

3

We denote by P = {P1; ... : PM } the family of projects and by O = {O1; ...; ON } the family of organizations. Projects
are understood as labeled sets of organizations and organizations as labeled sets of projects. The corresponding
intersection-graphs are denoted by GP and GO and we will sometimes use the terms P-graph and O-graph for them.
The size |x| of a vertex x from GP or GO is the cardinality of the set corresponding to the vertex; in the picture of
bipartite graphs, the size is just the degree of the vertex. In table II, we give some basic parameters measured on
the P- and O-graphs from the four Framework Programs. Since the degree distribution for P-graphs shows power law
behavior only up to medium size, we give the corresponding values for the exponents parenthetically.

As expected, FP1–4 are of small world type: high clustering coeﬃcient and small diameter of the giant component.
There is a slight increase in the clustering coeﬃcient of the O-graphs from FP1 to FP4, indicating a stronger integration
amongst groups of collaborating organizations. This is also reﬂected in the mean project size which increases from
2.4 to 6.2. There is an interesting jump in the P-graph mean degree values and the mean triangle numbers between
FP1 and 2 and between FP2 and 3. The maximal degree of the O-graphs are very high in comparison with the mean
degree, which is a consequence of the power law degree structure. For the P-graphs, the gap between mean and
maximal degree is less pronouncedm in agreement with the deviation from a power law for large degree values.

More information is contained in the statistical properties of the relevant distributions. The numerical data strongly
indicate that the size distributions follow power laws. Also, the O-graph degree distribution is of power-law type,
while the project-graph degree distribution is scale free only for small degree values. We discuss these properties at
greater length in the following sections.

A. Size distributions

Both the O-graph and P-graph size distributions show clear asymptotic power law distributions for FP1–4 (ﬁgs. 1
and 2).
In terms of the corresponding bipartite graph, these are just the degree distributions of the project and
organization partitions. While the O-graph size distribution is of power law type over the whole size range, the
P-graph size distribution deviates strongly from the power-law for small size values. In section IV, we give a possible
explanation for the appearance of the power law distribution for size.

The numerical values for the exponents of the organization size distributions from FP2–4 are very stable around
-2.1, indicating that the distribution of organizations able to carry out a particular number of projects has not changed
in the three Framework Programs. A complementary interpretation of this ﬁnding is that the underlying research
activities, which we know to have changed over time, have not altered the mix of organizations participating in a
particular number of projects in each Framework Program. It is further worth noting that the values of the exponents
equal, within error tolerance, the critical value 2 where the size expectation would start to diverge for large graphs.
The picture is similar for the P-graphs, although there are some diﬀerences in the initial behavior (that is, for small
project sizes) and in the exponent value. The local minima at size 2 is decreasing from FP2–4. This points to the
existence of an optimal project size within the regime of the EU FPs. Moreover, the rise in the average project size
indicates that increases in the available funding from FP2 to FP4 not only lead to more projects, but also slightly
larger projects. This is consistent with recommendations from evaluation studies and the stated attempts of the EU
commission to reduce its administrative burden.

As a whole, the size distribution for the P-graphs matches in the asymptotic regime very well to a power law with
exponent around -3, hence indicating that the mechanisms for coagulation of organizations into a project did not
greatly change from FP2–4. Since the degree distribution in the projection graphs is just the distribution of the size
of the 2-neighborhood N2 (x) := #
, it is not surprising that this quantity is closely connected to
the size distribution. In the absence of other special correlations, it can be shown (see section IV) that the degree
distribution is given by the same kind of law as the size distribution.

y : dbi (x, y) = 2

(cid:8)

B. The degree distribution

In ﬁgs. 3 and 4, we show the degree-distribution for the P- and O-graphs in a log-log plot. Recall that the degree
distribution is by deﬁnition the distribution of the number of vertices at distance two in the bipartite graph. While
the organization graphs for FP2–4 show a clear power law this is not longer true for the project graphs. The P-graph
degree distributions shows only a power law in the initial segment up to degree 150. Nevertheless there is still a
widely scattered heavy tail in the degree distribution. The deviation from a power law in the P-graphs indicates a
kind of anticorrelation: large projects above a size of 15 are mainly formed by organizations of small size. A possible
explanation is that large projects have a time- and resource-demanding intrinsic network structure, making it more
unlikely that a participating organization has other projects (of course, with the exception of hub-like organizations
such as CNRS with a priori unlimited capacity).

4

C. Clustering, correlation and edge multiplicity

By their construction process, intersection graphs have a naturally high clustering coeﬃcient. This is easy to
see, since an organization which participates in, say, k projects generates a complete subgraph of order k in the
P-graph amongst these projects. If the probability for an organization to be in more than one project is asymp-
totically bound away from zero, it follows that the P-graph (and similarly for the O-graph through an analo-
In the present study, we focus on the triangle number
gous argument) has a nonvanishing clustering coeﬃcient.
△ (x) := # {triangles containing x; x ∈ (P or O)} as a measure of local clustering. We deﬁne the degree-conditional
mean triangle number as △k := E {△ (x) | d (x) = k}. As seen in ﬁgs. 5 and 6, we have △k ∼ k for both graph types.
There is a good explanation for this type of behavior in the framework of intersection graphs (see section IV).
As noted above, high clustering in intersection graphs is not necessarily an indication of local correlations between
vertices. This is already seen in the case of an Erd¨os-Renyi random bipartite graph where an edge between any
project and organization is drawn i.i.d. with probability p. If P and O are of equal cardinality N and p = c
N , the
expected bipartite degree equals c. For large N a typical realization of the random graph looks locally like a tree
with branching number c − 1. However, for the projection graphs, we obtain an positive clustering coeﬃcient that
is independent of N , since most projects and organizations cause complete graphs of order c and a typical vertex is
therefore a member of ∼ c cliques of order c.

A good indication for the presence of correlations is given by the so-called multiplicity of edges. For a link between
two organizations or projects it is suﬃcient to have just one project or organization, respectively, in common, but of
course there could be more. Given an edge x ∼ y, we deﬁne m (x, y) := |x ∩ y| − 1 and call it the multiplicity of the
edge. In random intersection graphs without local search rules, like the one described above, the multiplicity would
be asymptotically zero almost surely for each vertex. In ﬁg. 7 and 8, the multiplicity distribution is shown for P- and
O-graphs of FP2–4. There is an almost perfect power-law behavior with exponent ..... Note that in the bipartite graph
picture, positive multiplicity translates into the presence of cycles of length four. The presence of exceptionally high
multiplicity in the P-graphs may be caused by memory eﬀects due to prior collaborative experience. Also, a greater
edge multiplicity may result from the fact that organizations are active in a wider set of complementary activities. In
this case, intra-organizational spillovers may also be of importance as search for potential partners may be inﬂuenced
by the collaboration behaviour of other actors within an organization. Such eﬀects should be detectable from a ﬁne
structure analysis of the time evolution of the corresponding graphs.

D. Diameter and mean path length

There is essentially no diﬀerence in the diameter value of the largest component in the four Framework Program
networks. A classical random graph of the same size and the same edge number would have a diameter about
log ¯d N . The mean path length is about a third of the diameter and and shows a slightly higher variation between
the diﬀerent framework programs. It is well known that the expected path length in random graphs with a scale free
degree distribution and exponent less than 3 is essentially independent of the graph size (the diameter of the largest
component still increases in N but only as log log N ). The same holds for random intersection graphs with power law
size and degree distributions. Since the the O-graphs seem to fall into that class, the almost constant diameter and
path length is not surprising. Although the P-graphs do not show an asymptotic power law structure for the degree,
there is a strong increase in the edge density from FP2 to FP4, keeping the diameter of the largest component almost
ﬁxed.

IV. A RANDOM INTERSECTION GRAPH MODEL

Intersection graphs are a natural framework for networks derived from a membership relation, such as citation
networks, actors networks, or networks reﬂecting any other kind of cooperation. As previously mentioned, intersection
graphs by construction have a high clustering coeﬃcient. As explained below, the clique distribution of a random
intersection graph is almost given by the size distribution of the dual graph.

A. Random intersection graphs with given size distribution

One of the simplest random intersection models is constructed in the following way. Knowing the size of a set to be
constructed, we generate a random subset from a ﬁnite base set X = {a1, a2, ..., aN } of N elements, such that each
set element is drawn i.i.d. uniformly from X. These subsets constitute the vertices of a random graph. Edges are

deﬁned via the set intersection property, namely we have an edge between i and j (denoted by i ∼ j) if and only if the
associated subsets Ai and Aj have nonempty intersection (to compare with earlier sections, A stands here for either
projects sets P or organization sets O). The size (cardinality) of the subsets is either itself a random variable drawn
i.i.d. from a probability distribution ϕ(k) or given by a list {Dk := # {Ai : |Ai|} = k} (where for each i a conditional
random choice is made to which size class it belongs). For the latter case, we deﬁne again ϕ(k) := Dk
M where M is the
total number of sets to be formed.

Since we want to compare the model with the EU- cooperation network we are mainly interested in the situation

when ϕ is an asymptotic power law distribution

1

ϕ(k) =

kα+o(1) ; α > 2

.

This assumption is also reasonable for many other applications where vertices are formed from a base set of elements.
To obtain an interesting limiting random graph space, we further assume that the number of chosen subsets is C1 · N
where C1 is neither too large nor too small (for FP2–4 we have about twice as many organization as projects hence
hence C1 is either 2 or 0.5).

A basic quantity for the analysis of intersection graphs is the conditional edge probability given the size of two

subsets:

Using the condition lk ≪ N , we obtain

Pk,l (N ) := Pr {i ∼ j | |Ai| = k and |Aj| = l }
= Pr {Ai ∩ Aj 6= ∅ | |Ai| = k and |Aj| = l}

With this result, we can easily calculate the conditional degree distribution for a vertex of given size. First, we estimate
the conditional subdegree distribution with respect to a given group of vertices of size m. Here, the subdegree dm (i)
of a vertex i is deﬁned as the number of edges i has with vertices of size m. Clearly d (i) =

dm (i) . We have

with c (m) = m1−αlC1C2. Since the distribution ψl (k) of the degree of vertices i with |Ai| = l is the convolution of
the Poisson distributions ψl (k, m), we obtain again a Poisson distribution for ψl (k) :

with cl =

c (m) = l · C3, where C3 =

the total degree distribution ψ (k). In [9] and [10], conditions were given describing when a superposition of Poisson

The main contribution to ψ (k) comes from a rather small interval of m-values, called Iess (k). This interval has the
property that for m ∈ Iess (k), the expectation E (d (i) | |Ai| = m) is of order k. The exponential decay of the Poisson
distribution guarantees that the remaining parts of the sum become arbitrarily small for large k. It is important that
the constant cl has a linear l−dependence since an l−proportionality with exponent larger than one would force the
degree distribution to have gaps due to a lack of overlap of the individual Poisson distributions. We therefore obtain
for the degree distribution a power law with the same exponent α as in the size distribution.

Although the intersection model gives a power-law degree distribution when the size distribution is already of power-
law type, we will not obtain a power-law distribution for the size on the dual graph unless additional assumptions
are made on the set formation rules. It is easy to see that the size distribution on the dual graph is asymptotically

and E (|A|) converges as well as M

Poisson. Since Pr {|x| = k} ∼
N for M, N → ∞,
(cid:17)
we obtain in the limit a Poisson distribution. Nevertheless, the degree distribution on the dual graph still admits a
scale-free part induced by the scale-free size distribution of the intersection graph. We will not discuss many of the
details, but instead provide a simple estimation for the lower bound on the number of elements ai with d (ai) = k.
Namely, the number of elements ai which are members of sets Aj with |Aj| = k is for large k and M, N >> k about
k·M·const
kα−2 as a lower bound on the density of
kα
elements ai with degree greater than or equal to k (note that we assumed α > 2). This estimate holds of course only
up to the maximal size value k, which is in the range of the power law distribution for the set sizes |Ai| . For larger
k-values there is a rapid exponential decay.

. Since d (ai) ≥ k for ai ∈ Aj with |Aj | = k, we obtain const

= N ·const
kα−1

Finally, we want to discuss the mean triangle (conditioned on the degree) - degree dependence, which shows a clear
linear behavior in the empirical data (see ﬁgs. 5 and 6). We argue that this is again a consequence of the power-
law distribution for the size. First observe that a size k element ai ∈ Aj induces a k − 1 complete subgraph on the
neighborhood vertices of Aj. Furthermore each maximal k−clique in which Aj is a member generates (k − 1) (k − 2) /2
triangles for Aj. Since the size distribution of the elements ai is Poisson with an expectation of, say, c and the degree
of Aj is proportional to the size |Aj|, we obtain for the conditional expected number of triangles △k given the degree
k:

△k := E (#triangles containing A | d (A) = k) ∼

const · k .

(17)

In deriving eq. (17), we used the facts that with high probability the size of the intersection between two sets Ai and
Aj has cardinality 1 (conditioned on the two sets having a nonempty intersection) and that the Poisson distribution
has an exponentially decaying tail.

B. A Molloy-Reed version of random intersection graphs

We sketch the construction of random intersection graphs with given size distribution ϕ and size distribution ψ on
the dual. The two distributions are not independent but have to fulﬁll the condition
i [ϕ (i) − ψ (i)] = 0. There are
further restrictions on the maximal size in order to get a reasonable random graph model. Note that the problem is
equivalent to the construction of a random bipartite graph given the degree sequence on the two partitions.

P

Assign ﬁrst to each set A and each element a from the base set a random size value according to the given
distributions ϕ and ψ. Let Dk be the resulting set of elements ai with size k. Replace each element from Dk by

k virtual elements ai,l, l = 1, 2..., k and form a new base set X ′ with all the virtual elements. The set formation
process for the sets {Ai} is now the same as in the previous section except that each chosen virtual element ai,l will be
removed from X ′ when it was selected ﬁrst into a set. After the sets are constructed, we identify the virtual elements
back into the original ones and deﬁne the corresponding intersection graph in the usual way. By construction, the
resulting size distribution on the dual graph is given by ψ as long as the probability of choosing two virtual elements
ai,l and ai,m (corresponding to the same element ai) is suﬃciently small. To ensure this, it is necessary to impose
restrictions on the maximal size values.

C. Random intersection graphs and the ”Cameo” principle

In this section, we give a possible explanation for the appearance of power laws in the size distribution. In most
models of complex networks with power-law like degree distributions, one assumes a kind of preferential attachment
rule as in the Albert and Barabasi model. This makes little sense in our framework. Instead we propose a rule called
the ”Cameo Principle” ﬁrst formulated in [2].

Before giving an interpretation and motivation we brieﬂy describe the formal setting. Assign to each project a
positive ϕ distributed random variable (r.v.) ω and to each organization a positive ψ− distributed r.v. µ (note that,
in contrast to section IV B, ϕ and ψ are not the size distributions). We assume ϕ and ψ to be supported on (1, ∞)
and monotone decaying as ω and µ tend to inﬁnity. On the bipartite graph an edge between an organization O and
a project P is then formed with probability

The interpretation behind the special form of edge probability in eq. (18) is the following. The ω and µ values
describe a kind of attractivity property inherent to projects and organizations. Thinking in terms of a virtual project
formation process the ﬁnal set of organizations belonging to a project P can either join the project actively—in
which case the µ value of P is important—or the organization more passively enters the project on the request of
organizations already involved—in which case the attractivity ω of the the corresponding organization is important.
The attractivity of an organization could, for instance, be related to its reputation, ﬁnancial strength, or quality of
earlier projects in which the organization was involved. Extrapolating from human behavior, it is not directly the ω
or µ value which enters the pairing probability, but rather the relative frequency of the ω or µ values: the rarer a
property, the more attractive it becomes. This is in essence the content of the “Cameo” principle.

The parameters α and β can be seen as a kind of aﬃnity to following the above rule; for α, β → 0 the rule is switched
oﬀ and we recover a classical Erd¨os-Renyi intersection graph. In general the values of α and β are themselves quenched
random variables with their own—usually unknown—distribution. As shown in [4], only the maximal α and β values
matter for the resulting degree distribution of the graphs. We therefore restrict ourself in the following to constant
values.

Since the conditional expectation of the size values (eqs. (20) and (21)) are proportional to ϕ−β and ψ−α, we have to
estimate their induced distribution. It can be shown [3] that z := ϕ−β (ω) is asymptotically distributed with density

8

α +o(1)) when ϕ (ω) decays monotone and faster than any power law to zero as ω → ∞. When ϕ (ω) is itself
z−(1+ 1
a power-law distribution with exponent γ, the resulting distribution for z will be z−(1+ 1
αγ +o(1)). Therefore, the
induced distribution is always a power law and independent of the details of ϕ. Applying this result to our model, we
obtain immediately a power law distribution for the size distribution on the P- and O-graphs with exponents depending
essentially only on α and β. It is not diﬃcult to see that, due to the edge independence in the model deﬁnition, the
resulting degree distributions are again of power-law type. The Cameo Ansatz hence generates in a natural way a
bipartite graph, where both projections admit two of the main features of the FP-networks. Furthermore, we obtain
a linear dependence of the mean triangle number △k on the degree, as in section IV A.

α − 1

None of the models discussed in section IV reproduce the scale-free distribution of the edge multiplicity observed
in each of the FP networks. This is due to the strong independence assumptions inherent to the models. Essentially
all set intersections have cardinality one and the probability of having intersections of cardinality l scales like N −l.
To generate higher intersection probabilities, one must make use of models with strong correlations, e.g., by memory
eﬀects. Integrating additional principles, like the ”My friends are your friends” principle [6], appears necessary to get
a power-law distribution for the edge multiplicity.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In terms of real-world interpretation, the present analysis yields three major insights. First, based on the fact that
the size distribution of projects did not change signiﬁcantly between the Framework Programs, any possible changes
in project formation rules—which we do not know at this stage—did not aﬀect the aggregate structure of the resulting
research networks. Second, the fact that integration between collaborating organizations has increased over time, as
measured by the average clustering coeﬃcient, indicates that Europe has already been moving towards a more closely
integrated European Research Area in the earlier Framework Programs. Finally, the fact that a sizeable number of
organizations collaborate more than once in each Frame Program shows that there appears to be a kind of robust
backbone structure in place, which may constitute the core of the European Research Area.

In terms of application, the present results suggest a number of extensions. First, it is essential to learn more about
the properties of the vertices in our networks. To what extent can they be characterized and classiﬁed? What kind of
structural patterns emerge if we add this information? Second, we need to know more about the micro-structure of the
networks. In which areas are the networks highly clustered and where does this clustering come from? What kind of
subgroups can be identiﬁed? Third, we need to learn more about where the observed distribution of edge multiplicity
comes from. Finally, it would be desirable to explicitly include edge weights into the analysis. Presumable, actors
who collaborate more frequently are more proximate to each other than actors who collaborate only once. This may
signiﬁcantly impact the structural features we are able to observe, as well as the conclusions we might draw concerning
the link between network structure and function.

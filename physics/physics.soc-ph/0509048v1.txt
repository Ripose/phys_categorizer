Individual’s scientiﬁc research output can be eﬀectively quantiﬁed as the number of papers h with
at least h citation. This index is robust, but strongly dependent on the research ﬁeld. Here we call
the attention that h is correlated to the number of authors in the papers. Thus, we propose a new
′
/Na, where hNai = Na/h with Na is the cummulated number of authors in

the considered h papers. The statistics of h (power laws) and h
(stretched exponential) are shown
the Brazilian scientiﬁc production in: Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Mathematics. This modiﬁed
index is statistically independent of h, it is still robust but less sensitive to diﬀerent research ﬁelds.
The top 10 h and h′ of each considered research ﬁeld are ranked.

INTRODUCTION

II. METHODOLOGY

Scientiﬁc research output quantiﬁcation has attracted
new proposals in the last months [1, 2].
In special,
Hirsch [1, 3, 4] has proposed a new h index to quan-
tify individual’s scientiﬁc research output. A researcher
with index h has h papers with at least h citations. This
index has several advantages, it:

1. combines productivity constancy with impact,

2. is easy to access the necessary data in the Thomp-

son ISI Web of Science database,

3. is robust to outliers,

4. is hard to inﬂate etc.

In one hand, this index is an interesting use of extrema
statistics, which is dominated by (Gumbel) exponential
density distributions. On the other hand, this index
is very sensitive to the research ﬁeld, being diﬃcult to
compare scientiﬁc research output even inside a given
ﬁeld. For instance, in general, theoretical and experi-
mental physicists have very diﬀerent h. Further, many
researchers have the same index, so that discrimination
among them is a hard task.

Here we propose an extension to the h index to include
co-authorship by a h′ index. The statistics of h and h′
are presented for the four major basic research ﬁelds in
Brazil. We also present the Brazilian top ten h and h′
researchers.

From Thompson ISI Web of Science database, we have
considered the Brazilian scientiﬁc research output in four
diﬀerent ﬁelds: Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Math-
ematics. Brazilian Science Indicators (BSI) database
was compiled based on the database of the Institute
for Scientiﬁc Information (ISI). The research was real-
ized using the query “Brazil OR Brasil” in the Address
ﬁeld. We have considered all documents published from
1945 up to 2004. The BSI database contains informa-
tion about 188,909 bibliographical references. This in-
formation includes type of publication, full reference; ci-
tations received yearly (June 2005), authors’ name and
address, including the name of the institution, city, state
and country. Among all reference, we have considered
only 150,323 articles, 24,164 meeting abstracts, 5,541
notes, 3,577 letters and 2,333 reviews. Documents have
been classiﬁed into the following research ﬁelds: Physics,
Chemistry, Biology or Mathematics using the tag sub-
ject. Then four lists were compiled containing author
name, publication number, times cited and number of
co-authors. Notice that authors can appear in more than
one list.

III. RESULTS

We have been able to verify that citation distributions
are described either by stretched exponentials [5] or q-
exponential [6] (See Fig. 1), as previously obtained [7, 8].
Also, we have veriﬁed that Nc,tot = ah2 (not shown), as
stated in Ref. [1].

According to Fig. 2, the h distributions for diﬀerent
ﬁelds tend to be power laws, with exponential cutoﬀ
(stretched exponentials) due to ﬁnite size eﬀects (not ﬁt-
ted). Notice however that in Physics there exist many
more researchers with h > 10 than the other research

ferent research ﬁelds in Brazil.

papers with more than 20 co-authors (outliers).

To consider the number of co-author per publication,
let us divide h by the mean number of co-authors in the h
publication. Thus, we obtain this new index h′, which is
statistically independent from h, and gives further infor-
mation about the research output. This index is also easy
to compute from the Thompson ISI Web of Science, once
h has been computed. As shown in Fig. 4 the rank plots
of h and h′ are strongly diﬀerent. Physics rank plot is
practically constant for the ﬁrst 1000 h-ranks, presenting
an abrupt decay afterwards. This rank plot drastically
diﬀers from the rank plot of other considered ﬁelds. The
h′ rank plot is much smoother, with greater range and
all the distributions are more similar among themselves.
Notice that we have not attempted to do a data collapse.
The top ten Brazilian h′-researchers are shown in Table I.
The mean number of co-authors in the h publications
is sensitive to outliers, a possibility (a little bit harder to
obtain) is to consider the median. We have observed a
strong correlation (r = 0.93) between the rankings using
the mean value and the median. Calling h′′ = h/m,
where m is the median of the number of co-authors in
the h publications is another possible index.

IV. CONCLUSION

The index h′ is complementary to h.

It lifts h de-
generescency and it has the advantage of being less sensi-
tive to diﬀerent research ﬁelds. This allows a less biased
comparison due to the consideration of co-authorship.
We stress that the Brazilian ranking presented takes into
account publications that have at least one co-author
with Brazilian address. It would be interesting to per-
form this study for other countries.

areas, making it to tend to converge more rapidly to a
power-law. The research ﬁelds Chemistry and Biology
behave similarly. In Brazil, we have observed that biolo-
gists have greater h than physicist, contrary to Hirsch’s
statement [1]. The top 10 Brazilian h-researchers are
displayed in Table I.

From Table I, one sees that it can be very diﬃcult
to compare researchers from diﬀerent ﬁelds. However,
we have noticed a strong correlation between h and the
number of co-authors that sign the top h publications.

As noted by Nature Editor [3] it is interesting to take
into account the number of co-authors in a scientiﬁc re-
search productivity index. The distributions of papers
with k co-authors are shown in Fig. 3. One sees that for
all considered research ﬁelds; the maximum of the dis-
tributions is two. Nevertheless Physics have much more

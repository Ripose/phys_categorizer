Abstract

We have studied the statistical mechanics of money circulation in a closed economic
system. An explicit statistical formulation of the circulation velocity of money is
presented for the ﬁrst time by introducing the concept of holding time of money.
The result indicates that the velocity is governed by behavior patterns of economic
agents. Computer simulations have been carried out in order to demonstrate the
shape of the holding time distribution. We ﬁnd that, money circulation is a Poisson
process in which the holding time probability distribution follows a type of Gamma
distribution, and the velocity of money depends on the share for exchange and the
number of agents.

Key words: money circulation, holding time, statistical distribution, Poisson
process, velocity of circulation

1 Introduction

Since there are so many analogies between some features of economy and
objects of physics, some advanced physical methods could be applied into an-
alyzing economic issues [1].In particular, the application of statistical physics
methods to ﬁnancial market has achieved a great success [2]. Recently, many
eﬀorts are being made to expand the scope of such analogical applications to
other economic problems [3,4]. Among these problems, the dynamics of money
has attracted much attention because of its signiﬁcance in economy [5,6,7]. By

identifying money in a closed economy with energy and the average amount
of money with temperature, Adrian Dr¨agulescu and Victor Yakovenko have
demonstrated that the equilibrium probability distribution of money follows
the exponential Boltzmann-Gibbs law due to the conservation of money [6].
The distribution of money in a real economy mainly depends on economic
agents’ behaviors and the manner they interact between each other. Accord-
ing to Adrian Dr¨agulescu and Victor Yakovenko, if a model has time-reversal
symmetry, then a stationary Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution can be obtained;
otherwise, the system may have a non- Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution or no
stationary distribution at all. Following this work, an example of stationary
non- Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution is given by Anirban Chakraborti and Bikas
K. Chakrabarti when the impact of the saving propensity of the agents on the
statistical mechanics of money is taken into account [7].

Indeed, money does matter in the performance of economy. The statistical
analysis of money is therefore essential and very intriguing. However, compar-
ing with its distribution among economic agents, understanding of the motion
of money in the economy is more signiﬁcant. As medium of exchange and unit
of accounting, money cannot be used up as consumption goods or worn oﬀ
as capital goods, but can only be transferred between agents. So it can be
assumed to be conserved after being injected into an economy. The picture
that money moves from hand to hand between agents in sequence draws some
physicists to use one-dimensional lattice or square lattice network models to
deal with monetary issues [4,5]. Although this analogy might appear attractive
intuitively, it is not a short-cut for addressing these issues. In fact, economists
have been thinking about the money in an alternative way by placing them-
selves in an economic space instead of usual physical one. The economic space
comprises only two parts: demand and supply. Correspondingly, the economic
agents can be classiﬁed to two groups: buyers and sellers. The former who
holds money is in the demand side and the latter who produces goods is in
the supply side. In economic space, the motion of money then can be ﬁgured
out as moving between these two regions. When exchange occurs in the mar-
ket, money ﬂows from demand region to supply region can be seen. After that,
money in the supply region is taken back to the demand region immediately,
because the seller who just participates in the exchange becomes a potential
buyer. It’s so-called circulation of money that the process takes place contin-
uously.

The most representative economic theory that copes with money in such a way
is the quantity theory of money [8], which describes the relationship between
money ﬂow and product ﬂow at macro level. As the total amount of money is
conserved, the money ﬂow originates from monetary circulation. Meanwhile
money is circulating; goods are continuously produced, exchanged and con-
sumed, in which the product ﬂow arises. Thus it can be seen that both ﬂows
coexist all the time and the ratio of them is called price level. Given the price

2

level ﬁxed, the money ﬂow corresponds to the product ﬂow. So the circulation
of money can reﬂect the operation of production economy. Furthermore, in a
market economy eﬀective demand is always deﬁcient and the real output is
dominated by willing expending. In this case, the circulation of money is not
only the reﬂection but also the driving force of production. This is the reason
that the quantity theory of money has been of high reputation in economics
since being set forth.

In the quantity theory of money, in order to express the relationship between
money and production, a signiﬁcant variable, the velocity of money circula-
tion, has been introduced. Although its deﬁnition is explicit, the essence of
this concept remains ambiguous. The velocity of money circulation is deﬁned
as the ratio of money ﬂow to the money stock. It can be calculated with
nominal gross domestic product (GDP) and total amount of money. There is
however no consensus so far on what factors govern this variable. Our goal is
to describe the velocity of money by utilizing the ideas and concepts from sta-
tistical physics and to show the statistical characteristics of money circulation
by computer simulations.

The statistical description of the velocity of money circulation is based on
holding time of money which is deﬁned as time interval between two trans-
actions. Although this concept is kept in mind when economists think of the
velocity, even the term referring to this kind of time interval has been men-
tioned in several cases, it’s somewhat new to them since there has been no
explicit speciﬁcation of it in economics. While there has been a similar term in
physics which is called waiting-time. In recent times, several eﬀorts have been
devoted to measure the waiting time distributions in ﬁnancial markets, see
e.g. [9,10]. In the process of money circulation, not only the amount of money
each agent holds can be considered as random variables, but also the holding
time between two transactions varies randomly. Thus there exists a holding
time distribution of money in a closed system and the connection between
holding time and the velocity is established. The holding time is not a phys-
ical time but an economic variable which is determined by economic agents’
behavior. Consequently, with the introduction of holding time the velocity can
be expressed in a statistical way, and furthermore a bridge that links such a
macroeconomic variable to individual agents’ choices might be set up.

We ﬁnd that the velocity of money is the expectation value of the reciprocal
of holding time. Thus the characteristics of the holding time distribution do
matter. Due to absence of the data of money circulation, empirical study is
not feasible. Therefore, we performed computer simulations to see the shape of
the holding time probability distribution and demonstrated how the individual
choices and other factors aﬀect the velocity.

Our model is a simple extension of Adrian Dr¨agulescu and Victor Yakovenko’s

3

work, in which random exchange approach remains. However, we placed em-
phasis on measuring holding time distribution instead of money distribution.
The dependences of the velocity of money circulation on some governing fac-
tors were discussed theoretically and experimentally.

2 The Quantity Theory of Money

When physicists intend to study economic issues, it is helpful to see how
economists deal with them. Having knowledge about relevant basic thoughts
and their context that economists have already developed enables us to apply
physics to those issues more eﬀectively. The circulation of money has been
talked about for hundreds of years; however, it is still a topic of great interest
with some puzzles uncovered. Many publications about it can be found in
economics literature. In this section we shall present a brief review of the
basic knowledge and the main results of the theory.

The quantity theory of money is a well-known doctrine to economists which
emphasizes that the money supply is the main determinant of nominal GDP.
This theory is constituted of two branches: one is built on the Fisher exchange
equation; the other is on the Cambridge cash balance equation. The Fisher
equation places emphasis on the part as medium of transactions that money
plays and states that [11]

MV = P Y,

where M is the amount of money in circulation, V the velocity of circulation
of money, P is the average price level and Y is the level of real income. The
left hand side of the equation represents the amount spent on ﬁnal goods
and services in transactions while the right hand side represents the amount
received for these goods and services. In other words, the left hand side is
the total spending from a monetary perspective while the right hand side is
that from a real view. By deﬁnition, these two sides must be equal. Thus this
equation shows the relationship between money ﬂow and product ﬂow. The
Cambridge equation proposes that money is desired as a store of value and
regarded money demand as a function of nominal income, i.e. [12]

(1)

(2)

M = kP Y,

where k is the famous “Cambridge constant”.

4

From Eq.(1) we can immediately obtain

∆M
M

+

∆V
V

=

∆P

∆Y
Y

.

(3)

But it is only a matter of arithmetic, not of economics. Till now we have not
made any assumption of the causality between left and right.

According to Fisher, the statement of the quantity theory requires three pillars:
ﬁrstly, that V and Y are ﬁxed with respect to the money supply. Secondly,
that the supply of money is exogenous. Thirdly, the direction of causation
runs from left (MV ) to right (P Y ). The story of the quantity theory then
runs like this: since V and Y are ﬁxed and M is exogenous, then an increase
in the supply of money will lead to an exactly proportionate increase in the
price level. Thus, money supply expansions only cause price inﬂation. This is
the so-called monetary neutrality. For reaching this, the last pillar is the most
crucial one among the three mentioned above.

Comparing equations (1) and (2), if we simply set k = 1/V , there seems
be no diﬀerence between these two. In fact, the Cambridge story, however,
is fundamentally diﬀerent from the Fisher story. The proposition that the
Cambridge advances comes from an implied hypothesis that the direction of
causation runs from right (kP Y ) to left (M). The reverse of causation leads
to a possible unstable “Cambridge constant”, that is to say, change in money
supply may have real eﬀects.

Following this line of the Cambridge approach, monetarists present a restate-
ment of the quantity theory of money [13]. But their fundamental contribu-
tions to the development of the theory are the empirical researches on this
aspect [14]. Basing on this work, they believe that the velocity of money is
stable.

Nowadays, as to the causality of money supply and the real output, most
economists believe that the monetary neutrality holds in the long run (a few
years). As Milton Friedman once made the statement, “Inﬂation is always and
everywhere a monetary phenomenon.” In the short run, however, they are not
in agreement about whether changes in the money supply lead to changes in
the price level or in the real output.

What on earth is the causality of money supply and the real output? And
why the monetary neutrality is correct in the long run but not in the short
run? The ﬁnish of solving these questions lies on the thorough understanding
to the nature of the circulation of money. In fact, with the development of
the quantity theory of money, people understand the velocity step by step; in
other words, the process of developing the quantity theory of money is actually
that of comprehending the velocity. The earliest version of the quantity theory

5

of money takes the velocity as an exogenous variable and being determined
by institutional arrangements and technologies of transaction. As a result, it
can be presumed as a constant. Cambridge economists think that money is
a kind of asset and the holders of them tend to optimize their portfolio. So
the factors related to money demand are considered when investigating the
velocity. Basing on that, Friedman dedicated precisely to unearthing the rela-
tionship between the velocity and those factors such as interest rate, expected
inﬂation, permanent income, and the return on money, etc. However, all of
analysis mentioned above is only qualitative, and no concrete function for ex-
pressing that relationship is oﬀered. In the following section, we shall present
a statistical expression of the velocity of money.

3 Statistical Analysis of The Circulation Velocity of Money

3.1 Holding time of money

The advantage of money as the medium of exchange, in that it overcomes
the need to obtain coincidence of wants; it implies that an agent can sell his
good at one time for “money” and then trading his “money” for the goods he
ﬁnally wishes to purchase at another time. The divorce of sale and purchase
results in a time interval within which money stays in the pocket of agents.
Moreover, money is an asset which allows value to be stored easily, and there
is also a time interval for agents to preserve it. In the real economy, money
is actually changing hands all the time. In this process, if an agent receives
money from others at one moment, he will hold it for a period, and eventually
pays something to another agent. Now we introduce a new concept named as
holding time which is deﬁned the interval between the receipt of income and
its disbursement.

Holding time is not an intrinsic character of money itself, but is a charac-
ter of its holder’s behavior in utilizing the money for certain purpose. The
reasons about why people hold money arise from the composite result of a
number of diﬀerent motives. Economists provide several variations of expla-
nations about it. According to traditional approach, the motives are classiﬁed
under three headings: the transactions-motive, the precautionary-motive and
the speculative-motive. Keynes classiﬁed them under four headings by further
dividing the transactions-motive into the income-motive and the business-
motive [15]. Despite what motives are taken into account and how they are
classiﬁed, the existence of holding time could not be denied. Their diﬀerences
are only embodied in determinants of the holding time.

In the circulation story, money circulates round and round in economic space.

6

At the beginning of one cycle, money stays in the demand region till it par-
ticipates in the transaction. When the exchange takes place, it moves to the
supply side and immediately goes back to the initial position and gets to the
end of this cycle or the beginning of the next. Since it is reasonable to assume
that the transaction does not take any time, the holding time is equal to the
period of one cycle that money goes.

3.2 Distribution of money over holding time

Let’s consider the economy in which the total quantity of money is M. At any
given time, each unit of them must have ever participated in the exchange at
certain previous moment and will repeat at a certain moment in the future.
Thus it has its own speciﬁc holding time at present. As a result, the money may
have diﬀerent holding time at the same time, due to either diﬀerent holders or
various motives of the same holder. Therefore, the conserved money spreads
over the holding times.

Now we introduce the probability distribution function of money P (τ ), which
is deﬁned the amount of money whose holding time is between τ and τ + dτ
is equal to MP (τ ) dτ . For any unit of money, P (τ ) is actually the probabil-
ity of taking part in exchange after an interval of τ . Thus we can give the
normalization condition as follows:

∞

Z
0

P (τ ) dτ = 1.

∞

¯τ =

Z
0

P (τ ) τ dτ.

And we can also have the expectation of the holding time of money, ¯τ .

(4)

(5)

We call it the average holding time of money.

Each unit of money injected into the economy changes hands for countless
times. The time interval between any two times is various because the hold-
ers may be diﬀerent. That is to say, the holding time of the same unit may
be altered at diﬀerent cycle due to the change of holder. It follows that the
distribution of money over the holding time evolves with time. If the behavior
pattern of the economic agents keeps unchanged, we can get an equilibrium
state where the distribution of money is stationary. In other words, any sin-
gle money’s holding time may strongly ﬂuctuate, but the overall probability
distribution does not change.

In the stationary state, the fraction of money MP (τ ) dτ participates in the

7

exchange after a period of τ . The money ﬂow generated by this fraction then
is

The total money ﬂow F in the economy is equal to the sum of the money
ﬂows due to the contribution of all parts whose holding time is equal to τ (τ ∈
[0, ∞) ), then we have

The velocity indicates the speed at which money circulates. From its deﬁnition
V = F/M, we get

(8)

This is the statistical expression of the circulation velocity of money with re-
spect to holding time. The result shows the velocity V is the mathematical
expectation of 1/τ . From Eqs.(5) and (8), it is obvious that the velocity and
the average holding time are reversely related. It also indicates that all the
impacts of factors related on the velocity take eﬀect through inﬂuencing the
economic agents’ choices of holding time. Thus, an eﬀective measure for in-
creasing (decreasing) the velocity of money is to motivate the economic agents
to shorten (lengthen) the average holding time.

The result that P (m) follows Boltzmann-Gibbs’ distribution arise from non-
negativity of the money amount possessed by each unit of agent and conserva-
tion of the total money. But till now we can not say anything about what the
distribution P (τ ) of money is likely to be. In order to see the characteristics
of P (τ ), we performed several computer simulations which will be described
in next section.

4 Model and Computer Simulations

The model we used is very similar to that of Adrian Dr¨agulescu and Victor
Yakovenko. The economic system is closed where the total money M and the
number of economic agents N are ﬁxed. Each of agents has a certain amount
of money initially. The money exchange is performed by agents in sequence. In
every round an arbitrary pair of agents is chosen to exchange, and the amount

8

of money that changes hands is given according to the trading rule. The non-
negativity of any agent’s money and the conservation of the total money in
each round are ensured.

We carried out the measurement by employing the trading rule which has
been used by Adrian Dr¨agulescu and Victor Yakovenko in their simulations.
Initially, the total money M is divided amongst N agents equally so that each
agent possesses the same amount of money M/N. We choose a pair of agents
randomly at a time; one of them is randomly picked to be the “receiver” ,
then the other one becomes the “payer”, and the amount ∆m is transferred
from the payer to the receiver. The trading rule lets the exchange amount in
each round be of the following form: ∆m = 1
2ν(m1 + m2), where ν(0 < ν < 1)
is a random fraction, m1 and m2 are the amount of money possessed by the
payer and the receiver, respectively. If the payer can’t oﬀer the amount, the
transfer dose not take place, and we turn to another pair of agents.

Following this procedure, the ﬁnal stationary distribution of money among
agents P (m) is Boltzmann-Gibbs’ distribution, which is shown in Fig. 1.
Whether the system is at stationary state or not is judged by observing the
∞
evolution of the entropy S = −
0 dmP (m) ln P (m). This is illustrated in the
R
inset of Fig. 1. All the records are obtained after S reaches the maximal value
denoted as the vertical line in the inset of Fig. 1, and average over 400 such
stationary distributions was taken to obtain a smooth distribution.

The main purpose of our simulation is to show the holding time distribution
of money P (τ ) instead of P (m). In order to obtain the holding times of all
money, we numbered all of the money and tracked each of them. The moment
at which each unit of money participated exchange for the latest time was
memorized. After majority (99%) of money had ever taken part in trade, we
began to measure holding times by recording the corresponding moment at
which each unit of money participated exchange for the ﬁrst time hereafter.
The holding time of each unit is the diﬀerence between the two moments. Due
to the random exchange, there are always a few units whose holding time is
too long to be recorded. Thus we just sampled the majority of total money,
and the remainder was omitted. After that we got the distribution of money
over holding time.

5 Results and Discussion

We performed several simulations of P (τ ) by altering values of N and M.
The results show that the holding time distributions of money we observed
are stationary and have remarkably similar form independent of the values
given. The typical one is illustrated in Fig. 2 where the size was taken to be

9

N = 2500 and M = 250000. However, the proﬁle of this distribution cannot
provide any clue to make sure which kind of distribution it belongs to.

To examine the origination of this distribution, we turned to observe another
kind of temporal distribution of money. Taking the time when we began to
record as zero point, hereafter, we set the moment at which the unit of money
is transferred for the ﬁrst time to be latency time of this unit. Please notice
that the latency time we deﬁned here is diﬀerent from the holding time of
money. Fig.3 shows the latency time distribution of money for this case. It
can be seen from the inset of Fig. 3 that the distribution follows exponential
law: P (t) = 1
T . The result we obtained here indicates that the transferring
process of money is a Poisson process with the rate of changes 1/T . Thus the
average latency time is equal to T and its value obtained in Fig. 3 is about
5550.

T e− t

Since the whole process is an independent stationary stochastic one, when we
begin to observe one unit of money, if we look forward from the zero point
of time, the probability of that it takes part in exchange during the period
between t and t + dt for the ﬁrst time is P (t) dt; if we look backward, the
probability of that the unit of money has ever been traded during the period
between −t and −t + dt and has been held till t = 0 is also P (t) dt. Suppose
the unit of money takes part in exchange at t1(t1 > 0) and its holding time
is τ (τ ≥ t1), then it must be transferred at moment t1 − τ . As a result, the
probability of this case is P (t1)P (τ − t1) dt1, and the probability of that the
holding time is equal to τ can be obtained

P (τ ) =

P (t1) P (τ − t1) dt1 =

τ

Z
0

1

T 2 τ e− τ

T .

(9)

This result shows the probability distribution of money over holding time
follows a type of Gamma distribution.

Substituting Eq.(9) into (8), we get

V =

1
T

.

¯τ = 2T.

It’s not surprising to this result for the velocity of money is just the rate
parameter of the circulation process. We further more substitute Eq.(9) into
(5), then

Thus the relationship between the velocity and the average holding time can

10

be simply expressed as follows:

¯τ =

2
V

.

We proceeded a ﬁtting of the simulation result in Fig. 2 with the theoretical
expression of Eq. (9) and found a good agreement. The ﬁtting value of the
average latency time is about 5548, which is almost the same as the result
derived from Fig. 3. The deviation may be due to nonuniform distribution of
random number generated in the process of simulation.

To consider how individual agent’s choice aﬀects the velocity of money, we
furthermore added a multiplier k and denominated it share for exchange, the
exchange amount then becomes ∆m = k
2 ν(m1 + m2). As a further check we
have determined the dependencies of the velocity of money on the share for
exchange k, the number of agents N and the average amount of money in the
system ¯m, which are shown in Figs. 4(a)-(c) respectively. For each case, we
performed the simulation and got a holding time distribution of money P (τ ),
after that the corresponding velocity was simply deduced by using Eq.(8).

In Fig. 4(a) we set N = 2500 and ¯m = 100. It can be seen that the velocity
is proportional to the share k. For larger share for exchange the velocity of
money in the trade process increases. So we can conclude that the circulation
velocity is determined by the agents’ behaviors in the exchange since the share
for exchange k reﬂects economic agent’s choice. Fig. 4(b) shows the velocity
of circulation V plotted versus 1/N, for k = 1 and ¯m = 100. As shown, V
vs 1/N is linear for the whole range of N. Fig. 4(c) shows the variation of
the velocity of circulation with average amount of money ¯m for k = 1 and
N = 2500, from which we can see that V remains constant for diﬀerent values
of ¯m.

These results can be understood by a simple deduction. According to the
trading rule: ∆m = k
2 ν(m1 + m2) and non-negativity of m, the average money
ﬂow, F , can be derived as follows:

From its deﬁnition it can also be written as

F = MV = N ¯mV.

Comparing these two equations above, we immediately get

F ∝ k ¯m.

V ∝

k
N

.

11

Thus the velocity of money is proportional to the share for exchange, re-
versely proportional to number of agents, and independent of average amount
of money. This theoretical result is in good agreement with that of simulations.

6 Summary

In this paper, we have considered money circulation in a closed economy by
applying the statistical approach. We present the quantity theory of money
brieﬂy to argue that the circulation velocity of money is an essential variable
for our understanding of the dynamics of money. By introducing the concept
of holding time of money, we provide a statistical expression of the circulation
velocity. The result indicates that the velocity and the average holding time are
reversely related and the main determinant of them is the agents’ behaviors.

We have performed several computer simulations based on random exchange
model. We ﬁnd the money involved in exchange process possesses not only
a stationary probability distribution among agents but also a stationary one
over holding time. The holding time probability distribution is found to be
a type of Gamma distribution because the circulation of money is a kind
of Poisson process. The dependence of the circulation velocity of money on
agents’ choices are demonstrated by changing the share for exchange. We also
investigated the dependence of the distribution on the number of agents and
the average amount of money per agent. The theoretical results we derived
according to the model show good agreements with the simulations. We believe
that this study promises a fresh insight into the velocity of money circulation
and opens a way to a ﬁrm microfoundation of it.

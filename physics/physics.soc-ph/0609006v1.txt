Dynamics of the Warsaw Stock Exchange index as analysed
by the nonhomogeneous fractional relaxation equation

We analyse the dynamics of the Warsaw Stock Exchange index WIG at
a daily time horizon before and after its well deﬁned local maxima of the
cusp-like shape decorated with oscillations. The rising and falling paths
of the index peaks can be described by the Mittag-Leﬄer function super-
posed with various types of oscillations. The latter is a solution of our
model of index dynamics deﬁned by the nonhomogeneous fractional relax-
ation equation. This solution is a generalised analog of an exactly solvable
model of viscoelastic materials. We found that the Warsaw Stock Exchange
can be considered as an intermediate system lying between two complex
ones, deﬁned by short and long-time limits of the Mittag-Leﬄer function;
these limits are given by the Kohlraush-Williams-Watts law for the initial
times, and the power-law or the Nutting law for asymptotic time. Hence
follows the corresponding short- and long-time power-law behaviour (diﬀer-
ent ”universality classes”) of the time-derivative of the logarithm of WIG
which can in fact be viewed as the ”ﬁnger print” of a dynamical critical
phenomenon.

1. Introduction

It seems that there are many distinct analogies between the dynamics
and/or stochastics of complex physical and economical or even social sys-
tems [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. The methods and even algorithms that have
been explored for description of physical phenomena become an eﬀective
background and inspiration for very productive methods used in analysis of
economical data [10, 11].

In this paper we study an emerging market and more precisely, the his-
torical Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE) index WIG at a daily time horizon
at the closing; we think that its dynamics is typical for an emerging ﬁnan-
cial market of small and moderate size. Our concept is to consider only well
developed temporal (local) maxima of the cusp-like shape decorated with
some oscillations (cf. peaks denoted by A, a, B, C in Fig.1) which cover the
greater part of the whole time series. Our goal is to describe the slowing
down of rising and relaxation processes within these temporal maxima by
assuming a retarded feedback as a principal eﬀect (except the rising path
within the ﬁrst local peak which, in principle, is exponential; cf. Fig.2).
This feedback is a reminiscence of investors’ activity stimulated mainly by
their observations of the empirical data in the past.

1.1. Inspiration

Our analysis was inspired by the non-Debye or non-exponential, frac-
tional relaxation processes observed, for example, in stress-strain relaxation
present in viscoelastic materials [19, 13, 14]. The most commonly used em-
pirical decay function for handling non-Debye relaxation processes in com-
plex systems are described either by a Kohlraush-Williams-Watts (KWW)
or a stretched exponential decay function [15] for short time-range t ≪ τ :

which deﬁnes the power-law limits of the dynamics, i.e. it deﬁnes (for t ≪ τ )
a universality class (characterized by dynamical, critical exponent 1 − α)
which, in fact, can be viewed as the ”ﬁnger print” of a dynamical critical
phenomenon. For such a peak the derivative diverges at the extremal point

ﬁnancial analysis both of stochastic or deterministic types, e.g. its time-derivative is
the instantaneous interest rate or return per unit time.

(i.e. at t = 0) which justiﬁes the name ”sharp peak” used often in the
therein). For a suﬃciently
[6] and refs.
literature in this context (cf.
wide empirical window it would be possible to observe a transition from the
KWW to the Nutting behaviour and from one kind of power-law to another,
correspondingly.

Note that the non-exponential relaxation introduces memory, i.e. the
underlying fundamental processes are of non-Markovian type. It was shown
that a natural way to incorporate memory eﬀects is fractional calculus.
The power-law kernel deﬁning the fractional relaxation equation involves a
particularly long memory. The function which plays a dominating role in
fractional relaxation problems is indeed the Mittag-Leﬄer (ML) function

which is a natural generalisation of the exponential one. This function in-
terpolates between cases (1) and (2) and plays a central role in our analysis.

2. The model

Our phenomenological model of index dynamics consists of two stages:

(i) Formulation of a linear ordinary diﬀerential equation of the ﬁrst or-
der with no feedback incorporated which describes evolution of an
auxiliary, synthetic index only.

(ii) A conjecture which transforms the above mentioned equation to a
more general fractional form which already models the evolution of
the empirical Warsaw Stock Exchange index.

The transition from (i) to (ii) means that the system is changed from an
unrealistic to a realistic, complex one where the retarded feedback plays an
essential role. By using this model we are able to describe the well developed
temporal maxima present in daily time series deﬁned by WIG activity (cf.
four maxima A, a, B and C shown in Fig.1).

2.1. Evolution of WIG

The time-dependent value of WIG, X(t), can be decomposed into two
components which are recorded and can be even electronically accessible for
traders:

Fig. 1. The daily closing value of the Warsaw Stock Exchange index WIG (measured
by conventional points (p)) from April 16, 1991 (the beginning of the Warsaw Stock
Exchange activity) to the 30th of March 2006; the presented time series consists
of empirical data points for 3382 trading days (td). The local maxima denoted as
A, a, B and C are analysed further in the text.

(a) The instantaneous oﬀset U (t) def.

= U+(t) − U−(t) between the temporal
(total) demand U+(t) ≥ 0 for stocks deﬁning WIG and their (total)
temporal supply U−(t) ≥ 0.

(b) The instantaneous volume trade V (t) def.
of the companies which consitute WIG.

= min[U+(t), U−(t)] of stocks

Hence, we can write the following instantaneous superposition

X(t) = A · U (t) + B · V (t),

(5)

where A(> 0) and B are referred to as coeﬃcients of relocation. Note that
paradoxally index X(t)2 can change even when the volume of trade, V (t),
vanishes, i.e. when the demand or supply vanishes. On the other hand, for
vanishing U (t) (when the demand is balanced by the supply) volume trade,
V (t), can be still nonvanishing which leads to the change of WIG3.

2 Note that X(t) is deﬁned here relative to some reference level so it can be, in general,

both positive and negative.

3 Eq.(5) deﬁnes an additive variant of our model though a multiplicative one is also

possible.

To consider the dynamics (evolution) of WIG, we complete eq.(5) by
the diﬀerential one which exhibits an instantaneous, therefore unrealistic,
feedback to the ﬁnancial market, namely

dV (t)

= C · V (t) + D · X(t) + E ·

(6)

,

where coeﬃcients C, D are rates while E is again a kind of relocation
coeﬃcient. By combining eqs.(5) and (6) we eliminate the V (t) variable
and obtain (after integration),

which are valid for BE 6= 1; otherwise, instead of eq.(7) we would obtain a
very special one.

The integral eq.(7) deﬁnes the model which is an analog of the Zener one
for viscoelastic solids [17] in which the stress (U ) - strain (X) relationship4
is given originally by the linear ﬁrst order diﬀerential equation [14]. Indeed,
eq.(7) is the one which we generalize to the fractional form by applying its
Maxwell formulation [18]. This formulation consists of a spring (obeying
Hooke’s law) and a dashpot (obeying Newton’s law of viscosity) in series;
this arrangement shows a simple spatial separation of the solid (elastic) and
the ﬂuid (viscous) aspects and it is too speciﬁc to describe real viscoelastic
materials. However, the hierarchical arrangement of a number (in general
inﬁnite) springs and dashpots is already suﬃcient [18]. Note, that in our ap-
proach the spring deﬁnes a purely emotional or irrational investors’ activity5
while the dashpot deﬁnes a purely rational one.
4 Usually the stress is denoted by σ and strain by ǫ.
5 In psychology more often is used terminology ’aﬀected driven activity’ or ’authomatic

activity’.

2.2. Conjecture

There are several deﬁnitions of fractional diﬀerentiation and integration
[19]. In what follows we are dealing strictly with the Liouville-Riemann (LR)
fractional calculus. The fractional integration of arbitrary order α(> 0) of
function f (t) is a straightforward generalisation of (8),

The fractional generalization of eq.(7) is performed by replacing expres-
sions τ −1
t X(t) by τ −α
t X(t)
ones, respectively, where the fractional (in general) exponent α is a free but
most important shape parameter. Hence, we obtain the fractional integral
equation which is able to describe both independent paths (the rising and
relaxation) of local temporary peaks of WIG:

variable

for rising: t ≤ tM AX

y =

(cid:26)

As both paths of any peak are assumed as independent ones we consider all
parameters present in eq.(11) as (in general) diﬀerent for diﬀerent paths.

For relaxation the ﬁrst term on the rhs of eq.(11) describes feedback
where the retarded value of index inﬂuences the present one; this value is
sensitive here to the past one due to the algebraic, integral kernel. The
second term on the rhs of eq.(11) desribes explicitly a ﬁnancial market
retarded inﬂuence on the index (or the stock price); the third term gives
the instantaneous inﬂuence. However, for the rising path the situation is
more complicated and eq.(11) constitutes only a formal, convenient way to
describe it. As we prove, the ﬁrst and third terms constitute mainly the
basis of a dynamical structure of the local (temporal) maximum of WIG.

2.3. Relaxation and rising fractional diﬀerential equations

To make a step towards the interpretation, we deﬁne the fractional dif-

ferentiation of order γ(> 0)

which is considered to be composed of a fractional integration of the order
α def.
= n − γ (−1 ≤ γ − n < 0) followed by an ordinary diﬀerentiation of
order n. Now, by ordinary diﬀerentiation of the ﬁrst order of eq.(11) and
by applying deﬁnition (13) we obtain the linear inhomogeneous fractional
diﬀerential equation

which describes well both paths of the studied peaks.

2.3.1. Free fractional relaxation: the reference case

We found that the well developed local maxima of the index can be ﬁtted
(except for the left-hand side of the ﬁrst one and up to their oscillations and
ﬂuctuations) by an intermediate part of the ML function. In our case we
obtained several values of exponent α for WIG’s maxima and almost all
of them (except one) are smaller than 0.5; note that the left-hand side of
the ﬁrst maximum is well ﬁtted by the usual exponential function (or by
assuming α = 1 in the MF function).

In other words, the relaxation of almost all WIG local maxima can be de-
scribed by the fractional relaxation equation by setting in eq.(14) coeﬃcient
A′ = 0. Such a simpliﬁed equation is, of course, a fractional generalization
of the standard relaxation equation whose solution has indeed the form (4)
(where variable t is replaced by y and parameter τ by corresponding τ1 one).
This solution is considered here only as a reference case.

2.4. Full Solution of the Fractional Initial Value Problem

We solve the fractional initial value problem (14) by assuming that

U (y) =

[exp(ı (ω − ∆ω) y) + exp(ı (ω + ∆ω) y)],

(15)

U (0)
2

(where parameters U (0), ω, ∆ω > 0) and by applying the Laplace transform
of a fractional integral operator. Namely, the Laplace transformation of
eq.(11) yields
˜X(s) = A′ 1 − sgn(C)τ −α

s−1

1 + τ −α
where the Laplace transform of the LR fractional integral operator was ap-
plied here. By introducing the Laplace transform of (15) into eq.(16) and by

2.5. Comparison with empirical data and discussion

In Figs.2-5 we compared the empirical data deﬁning WIG’s local maxima
(denoted as A, a, B, and C in Fig.1) with the predictions given by formula
(17). The monotonic curves (obtained by using only the ﬁrst term) present
free solutions while the oscillating curves (obtained by using the whole ex-
pression) the full ones, i.e. the free solutions decorated with mono-frequency
oscillations (rising and falling paths of peaks a and B, respectively) or wig-
gles (right-hand paths of peaks A and a as well as left-hand path of peak B).
The values of the key parameters which we obtained are shown in Tables
1-46.

In Fig.6 are presented: (i) the Mittag-Leﬄer function ﬁtted, for example,
to the left-hand path of the empirical maximum B (this is the free solution
taken, in fact, from Fig.4), and corresponding (ii) KWW law (lower curve)

as well as (iii) the Nutting law (upper curve). This is a typical situation
valid both for the left- and right-hand paths of all considered peaks. It is
characteristic that none of the peaks reached the fully developed scaling

using eq.(17); the corresponding key parameters are presented in Table 2.

noted:

(i) Both paths of any peak can be considered as independent ones and

the location of turning point (extremum) as a random one.

(ii) The considered peaks are asymmetric since:

• the exponent α, which characterizes the left-hand paths of any
peak, is larger than the analogous one characterizing the right-
hand one,

• parameter τ1 (deﬁning the time unit) of the left-hand path is
smaller than the corresponding one for the right-hand path.

(iii) The location of the extremal point tM AX given by expression (17) is
(in general) diﬀerent for left- and right-hand paths of each peak.

Moreover, a frequency modulation signal is necessary and/or the inﬂuence
of the signal outside the maximum should be taken into account to describe
the beginning of the left-hand paths of peaks a and B (cf. Figs.3 and 4).

Concluding, we suggest that our approach can rationally decrease the
risk of investment on the stock market since it is able to warn the investors
before the stock market reaches a critical region.

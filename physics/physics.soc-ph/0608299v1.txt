Stochastic volatility of ﬁnancial markets as the ﬂuctuating rate of trading:
an empirical study

We present an empirical study of the subordination hypothesis for a stochastic time series of a
stock price. The ﬂuctuating rate of trading is identiﬁed with the stochastic variance of the stock
price, as in the continuous-time random walk (CTRW) framework. The probability distribution of
the stock price changes (log-returns) for a given number of trades N is found to be approximately
Gaussian. The probability distribution of N for a given time interval ∆t is non-Poissonian and has
an exponential tail for large N and a sharp cutoﬀ for small N . Combining these two distributions
produces a nontrivial distribution of log-returns for a given time interval ∆t, which has exponential
tails and a Gaussian central part, in agreement with empirical observations.

Introduction: stochastic volatility, subordination, and
ﬂuctuations in the number of trades. The stock price St
is a stochastic series in time t. It is commonly character-
ized by the probability distribution P∆t(x) of detrended
log-returns x = ln(St2 /St1)
µ∆t, where the time inter-
val ∆t = t2
t1 is called the time lag or time horizon, and
µ is the average growth rate. For a simple multiplicative
(geometric) random walk, the probability distribution is
x2/2v∆t), where v = σ2 is
Gaussian: P∆t(x)
−
the variance, and σ is the volatility. However, the empir-
ically observed probability distribution of log-returns is
not Gaussian. It is well known that the distribution has
power-law tails for large x [1, 2]. However, the distribu-
tion is also non-Gaussian for small and moderate x, where
is follows the tent-shaped exponential (also called double-
/√∆t), as

emphasized in Ref. [3]. The exponential distribution was
found by many researchers [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], so it
should be treated as a ubiquitous stylized fact for ﬁnan-
cial markets [3].

In order to explain the non-Gaussian character of the
distribution of returns, models with stochastic volatil-
ity were proposed in literature [12, 13, 14]. If the vari-
ance vt changes in time, then v∆t in the Gaussian dis-
tribution should be replaced by the integrated variance
V∆t =
If the variance is stochastic, then we
should average over the probability distribution Q∆t(V )
of the integrated variance V for the time interval ∆t:

The representation (1) is called the subordination [15,
16].
In this approach, the non-Gaussian character of
P∆t(x) results from a non-trivial distribution Q∆t(V ).

In the models with stochastic volatility, the variables v
or V are treated as hidden stochastic variables. One may
try to identify these phenomenological variables with
some empirically observable and measurable components
of the ﬁnancial data. It was argued [17, 18, 19] that the

integrated variance V∆t may correspond to the number
of trades (transactions) N∆t during the time interval ∆t:
V∆t = ξN∆t, where ξ is a coeﬃcient [20]. Every transac-
tion may change the price up or down, so the probability
distribution PN (x) after N trades would be Gaussian:

and use integration, rather than summartion, over N .)
In this approach, the stochastic variance v reﬂects the
ﬂuctuating rate of trading in the market.

Performing the Fourier transform of (3) with respect
to x, we ﬁnd that the characteristic function ˜P∆t(kx)
is directly related to the Laplace transform ˜K∆t(kN ) of
K∆t(N ) with respect to N , where kx and kN are the
Fourier and Laplace variables conjugated to x and N :

In this paper, we study whether the subordinated rep-
resentation (3) agrees with ﬁnancial data. First, we ver-
ify whether PN (x) is Gaussian, as suggested by Eq. (2).
Second, we check whether empirical data satisfy Eq. (4).
Third, we obtain K∆t(N ) empirically and, ﬁnally, discuss
whether P∆t(x) constructed from Eq. (3) agrees with the
data. Refs. [18, 19] have already presented evidence in
favor of the ﬁrst conjecture; however, the other questions
were not studied systematically in literature.

The subordination was also studied in physics lit-
erature as the continuous-time random walk (CTRW)
[21, 22]. Refs. [23, 24, 25] focused on the probability

qutive transactions (∆N = 1). Our approach is to study
the distribution function K∆t(N ), which gives comple-
mentary information and can be examined for a wide va-
riety of time lags. In Ref. [26], this function was studied
for some Russian stocks.

We use the TAQ database from NYSE [27], which
records every transaction in the market (tick-by-tick
data). We focus on the Intel stock (INTC), because it is
highly traded, with the average number of transactions
104. Here we present the data for
per day about 2.5
the period 1 January – 31 December 1999, but we found
similar results for 1997 as well [28]. Because of diﬃcul-
ties in dealing with overnight price changes, we limit our
consideration to the intraday data. Since ∆t is relatively
short here, the term µ∆t is small and can be neglected.

but there are deviations in the tails, as expected for large

Fig. 4 shows the Q-Q plot similar to the one con-

the vertical axis shows the empirical CN (x/σN ), and the
horizontal axis shows the cumulative Gaussian distribu-
tion of x/σ, whereas the parameter x changes from
−∞
to +
. The plots for diﬀerent N are all close to the di-
agonal, which indicates agreement between the empirical
and the Gaussian distribution functions. Fig. 4 empha-
sizes the central part of the distribution, whereas Fig. 3
emphasizes the tails. Overall, we conclude the empirical
distribution PN (x) is reasonably close to the Gaussian in
the central part, so Eq. (2) is approximately satisﬁed.

When the time lag approaches one day, the number of
data points become too small to construct reliable prob-
ability densities, so we cannot verify the Gaussian hy-
pothesis beyond the intraday data. When the time lag
is too short, and the corresponding N is small, the log-
returns are discrete and cannot be described by a con-
tinuous function, such as Gaussian. We found that the
distribution of x becomes reasonably smooth only after a
thousand of trades [28]. Discreteness of the distribution
for small N can be seen in Fig. 11 of Ref. [30].

and Eq. (5) ensure that the slope of the parametric plot
near the point (1, 1) corresponds to the diagonal. Overall,
the plots for diﬀerent ∆t in Fig. 5 are close to the diago-
nal, but deviate in the lower corner for large
, which
indicates that the subordination relation (4) is satisﬁed
only approximately. Notice that no assumptions about
the functional form of K∆t(N ) are made in Eq. (4). The
only assumption is that PN (x) is Gaussian (2), and the
distributions of x and N are uncorrelated, so they can be
combined in Eq. (3).

It was suggested in literature
that K∆t(N ) may be approximated by the log-normal

nate between the alternative hypotheses here, but some-
times these functions may look alike [31]. A qualitatively
similar distribution K∆t(N ) was found for some Russian
stocks in Ref. [26].

(7)
Eq. (7) shows that the exponential distribution of the
number of trades N results in the exponential (Laplace)
distribution of log-returns x. This can be understood as
follows. The integral (7) can be taken exactly, but one
can also evaluate it approximately by integrating around
x
the optimal value of N∗ =
η∆t/2ξ that minimizes
|p
|
the negative expression in the exponent of Eq. (7) and
maximizes the integrand. We see that the probability to
have a given log-return x is controlled by the probability
to have the optimal number of trades N∗(x). Thus, the
distribution P∆t(x) has the fatter (exponential) tails than
Gaussian, because the probability to have a large x is
enhanced by ﬂuctuations with large N .

On the other hand, for very small x, the optimal value
N∗ becomes limited by the cutoﬀ in K∆t(N ) for small N .
At this point, the optimal value N∗ stops depending on
x, so P∆t(x) becomes Gaussian. Thus, we expect to see
x
the Gaussian behavior in P∆t(x) for small
and the

exponential behavior for medium and large

shows a log-linear plot of the empirical probability den-
sity P∆t(x). In agreement with the qualitative analysis
presented above, we observe that the data points follow
and fall on
the parabolic (Gaussian) curve for small
x
|
|
the straight (exponential) lines for large
. The range
x
|
|
of x occupied by the Gaussian expands when the time lag
∆t increases, because the cutoﬀ in K∆t(N ) for small N
increases with the increase of ∆t, as shown in Fig. 6. We
conclude that the subordination hypothesis (3) is qualita-
tively valid, and, particularly, it explains the exponential
distribution P∆t(x) for x as a result of the exponential
distribution K∆t(N ) for the number of trades N .

The solid lines in Fig. 7 show ﬁts of the data to the
Heston model. The Heston model [13] is a model with
stochastic volatility, which has the advantage of being
exactly solvable. A closed-form solution for P∆t(x) was
obtained in Ref. [32], and Fig. 7 shows ﬁts of the data
to the formula derived there. Refs. [3, 32] pointed out
that P∆t(x) in the Heston model has the exponential
tails and Gaussian center, in qualitative and quantitative
agreement with the empirical distribution of log-returns.
Given the veriﬁcation of the subordination hypothesis
presented in this paper, one may ask whether the Heston
model describes the probability distribution K∆t(N ) for
the number of trades N . A detailed study of this question
will be presented in a separate paper [33].

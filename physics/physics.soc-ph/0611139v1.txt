Abstract

We propose a model for an evolving citation network that incorporates the citation pattern

followed in a particular discipline. We deﬁne the citation pattern in a discipline by three factors.

The average number of references per article, the probability of citing an article based on it’s age and

the number of citations it already has. We also consider the average number of articles published

per year in the discipline. We propose that the probability of citing an article based on it’s age

can be modeled by a lifetime distribution. The lifetime distribution models the citation lifetime

of an average article in a particular discipline. We ﬁnd that the citation lifetime distribution in a

particular discipline predicts the topological structure of the citation network in that discipline. We

show that the power law exponent depends on the three factors that deﬁne the citation pattern.

Finally we ﬁt the data from the Physical Review D journal to obtain the citation pattern and

calculate the total degree distribution for the citation network.

INTRODUCTION

Citation networks of scholarly publications have generated considerable interest in recent

times. In citation networks, the articles are the nodes and an edge is attached between two

nodes when one article cites another. Similar to other networks, such as the telecommuni-

cation network, social networks, neural networks etc., citation networks were also observed

to have a scale free structure [1]. The ﬁrst study of citation statistics was made by de Solla

Price[1] who proposed that the rate at which an article gets cited is proportional to the num-

ber of citations it already has. His model was based on the models by Yule [2] and Simon [3].

Later, a simple analytical model which leads to a scale free structure in growing networks

was proposed by Barab´asi and Albert [4]. The Barab´asi- Albert (BA) model introduced a

similar concept called preferential attachment whereby a new node is connected to some old

node in the network based on it’s number of edges. This leads to the scale free structure

in most networks. In all these models, an older node with a large number of edges will go

on accumulating new edges irrespective of it’s age. However, citation networks obtained

from real world datasets do not follow a simple scaling solution. Though people tend to cite

highly cited papers, old papers are rarely cited, especially if the research described in them

have already been incorporated in recent text books. This lead to modiﬁcations to the BA

model where the attachment probability depended on the number of edges of the node and

was also proportional to some power of the age of the node [6].

Lehmann et. al. [7] found that though the citation network in the SPIRES database could

be described by simple power laws, the exponent of the power law changed when the number

of citations exceeded a certain value. The data thus suggested that the citation distribution

is described by two independent power laws in two diﬀerent domains. The data could also

be ﬁtted with a stretched exponential. They developed a model [8] where some nodes are

considered dead after sometime and are not able to acquire new links in the growing network.

Their model successfully explained the results from the SPIRES database. Similarly Chun

et. al.

[9] who studied the citation network in the journal Scientometrics, found that the

out-degree in the citation network could be ﬁtted by two independent power laws whereas

the in-degree could be ﬁtted with a single power law. Vazquez [10] did a detailed study

of the out-degree distribution of citation networks from various journals. He found that

there was a diﬀerence in the citation distribution for journals which have a restriction in the

2

number of pages per article. He proposed a recursive search model which partially explained

some of the features observed in various citation networks. B¨orner et al.[11] proposed the

TARL (Topics, Aging, Recursive Linking) model, which is a general process model that

models the growth of a bipartite network of authors and articles. They used a 20 year data

set of articles published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) to

validate their model. The deviations from power law in the citation distribution observed for

the PNAS data set could be explained by their model. In the TARL model, the probability

of highly cited papers garnering more citations is oﬀset by incorporating a bias to cite more

recent papers. The number of citations received as a function of age was ﬁtted by a Weibull

distribution. The scale parameter of the Weibull distribution represented the aging bias.

Apart from these models that explained the scaling co-eﬀecients of speciﬁc data sets, there

were other general analytical models where the attachment probability depended exponen-

tially on the age of the node [12, 13]. These studies demonstrated that the introduction

of aging signiﬁcantly transformed the statistical properties of the growing network [13]. In

this work, we aim to understand the underlying reasons that govern the power law behavior

and scaling co-eﬃcients of various citation networks. We propose a general analytical model

that incorporates the citation pattern in a particular discipline to predict the topological

structure of the ﬁnal network. Citation patterns in diﬀerent disciplines are not always well

deﬁned. To obtain quantitative estimates we deﬁne the citation pattern in a particular

discipline by the following factors, (i) the average number of references per article, (ii) the

citation probability based on age and (iii) the citation probability based on the number of

citations it already has. In addition, we also consider the average number of articles pub-

lished in that discipline per year. Our citation probability depends on age and previous

number of citations. These two probabilities are assumed to be independent of each other.

We use the master equation approach and solve the diﬀerence-diﬀerential equation to ob-

tain the probability of a node to have k number of citations at time t. Finally, the degree

distribution is obtained by summing over all the nodes in the network at a particular time.

The probability of citing an article based on the number of citations it already has, is

modeled by the preferential attachment method proposed by Barab´asi and Albert [4]. We

propose that the probability of citing an article based on it’s age can be modeled by a

lifetime distribution. Lifetime distributions like the Weibull and the lognormal have been

used extensively for life data analysis in predicting the mean life for a wide array of complex

3

machinery and other products for everyday use. They have been used to model the lifetime

of organisms in an ecosystem, here we use them to model the citation lifetime of an article

in a particular discipline. Citation lifetime is given by the distribution of citations over time

[5]. A high citation lifetime indicates that articles are being cited over a longer period of

time. The other reason for using lifetime distributions is that they are very versatile and

can take on the characteristics of other types of distributions based on the value of their

parameters (e.g. the Weibull gives the exponential distribution for a shape parameter of 1).

We ﬁnd that the probability of a node to have k number of citations at time t depends on

the parameters of the chosen distribution. For certain parameters it is possible to obtain

a power law distribution while for others it is more like a stretched exponential. Since the

parameters of the chosen distribution themselves depend on the citation pattern in that

particular discipline, we conclude that it is the citation pattern in a particular discipline

which plays a signiﬁcant role in the degree distribution of a citation network. Our results

show that the scaling exponents of the ﬁnal degree distribution depends signiﬁcantly on the

citation pattern.

II. OUR MODEL

As we are dealing with a citation network here, the nodes of the network are the articles

that are published. So nodes and articles refer to the same object in our model. Like

previous models [12, 13] we consider preferential attachment and aging to be independent

of each other. So the total attachment probability in our model depends on the degree of a

particular node k and it’s age (t

t0) where t is the present time and t0 is the time it entered

−

the growing network. We assign an initial degree k0 to each node. k is the total degree

of a particular node, so its out-degree is k0 and in-degree is (k

k0). For the time being

however, we do not make a distinction between incoming and outgoing degree distribution.

Our time unit here is in years and m number of nodes enter the network at each timestep.

The probability p(k, t

t0) that a node (which had entered the network at time t0) will have

a degree k at time t is given by,

integral analytically using special functions. The ﬁnal answer is a non-trivial combination

of the error function and the exponential integral. Since we are dealing with ﬁnite time

periods, we choose to solve the integral numerically.

In the next section, we obtain the total degree distribution for two diﬀerent distributions,

the Weibull distribution and the lognormal distribution. The two-parameter Weibull and the

lognormal distribution are characterized by the shape parameter a, and the scale parameter

b. We impose the condition f (t

t0) is zero at t = t0. For a given dataset, we can ﬁt the data

−

and obtain the two parameters but for our analysis we consider the shape parameters to be

constant and vary only the scale parameters. The eﬀect of the scale parameter is to stretch

the distribution. Since the distribution is over age here, increasing the scale parameter

means citing relatively older papers.

III. RESULTS

Apart from the parameters characterizing the probability of citing articles based on their

age, we also have two other inputs, the average number of papers published each year

m, and the average number of references k0 each paper has.

Initially we keep these two

factors constant and investigate the eﬀect of the citation distribution on the total degree

distribution. We consider m = 200 and k0 = 20 and the time period is 50 years.

A. Weibull distribution

We consider the two parameter Weibull distribution given by,

f (t

−

t0) = ab−a(t

t0)(a−1) exp(

−

((t

−

−

t0)/b)a)

(8)

The shape parameter a = 2 satisﬁes our initial condition. The scale parameter is varied to

study how the distribution pattern aﬀects the ﬁnal structure of the network.

Fig. 1 gives the citation lifetime distribution of an article for the Weibull distribution.

The x-axis is the age of the article and the y-axis gives it’s probability of citation. The solid

(red) line is for scale parameter b = 5 and the dashed (green) line is for b = 20. b = 20

means that the discipline tends to cite relatively older articles while b = 5 indicates that

recent articles are more likely to be cited.

the Weibull function the tail of the degree distribution changes when the citation pattern

changes. We do not get a simple power law in any of the cases. However, for b = 5, it

is possible to ﬁt the ﬁnal degree distribution using two power laws. This implies that in

disciplines where more recent articles are likely to be cited, the total degree distribution can

be described by two power laws with diﬀerent coeﬃcients.

B. Lognormal distribution

The other commonly used lifetime distribution is the lognormal distribution given by,

This satisﬁes our boundary condition for a = 0.5. The scale parameter here is taken to

b = 1.5 and b = 3.0.

Fig. 3 gives the citation lifetime distribution of an article for the lognormal distribution.

The x-axis is the age of the article and the y-axis gives it’s probability of citation. The solid

(red) line is for scale parameter b = 1.5 and the dashed (green) line is for b = 3.0. Again,

b = 3.0 means that the discipline tends to cite older articles while b = 1.5 indicates that

recent articles are more likely to be cited. The distributions are similar with some minor

diﬀerences. The rising of the curves are diﬀerent. So the number of citations that articles

accumulate in the initial years after publication determine whether the citation lifetime can

Fig. 4 gives the total degree distribution for the lognormal distribution. As expected,

it is similar to the one obtained for the Weibull. However, unlike the Weibull, here there

are diﬀerences both in the initial and the tail part for the diﬀerent scale parameters. The

Weibull distribution with b = 20 and the lognormal distribution with b = 3.0 gives similar

degree distributions. It is when b is small, we see that the total degree distribution changes

depending on the kind of lifetime distribution considered. This implies that if the average

FIG. 4:

8

citation age of an article in a discipline is small, the number of citations received in the initial

years after publication are important to determine the structure of the citation network in

that discipline.

We have thus veriﬁed that citing patterns do indeed aﬀect the ﬁnal degree distribution of

the network. The two lifetime distributions that we have chosen reﬂect the citation patterns

in diﬀerent disciplines. The two distributions diﬀer in the rise of the citation probability

with age. Though the scale parameter stretches both the distributions, for the lognormal

distribution, the number of years before an article actually gets cited also changes. This

changes the total number of citations accumulated in the initial years. The parameters of

either of these distributions can be chosen to obtain a heavy tailed distribution. The scale

parameter in that case would be small. Since the structure of the citation network depends

on the parameters of the distribution, we conclude that the average age of citations in a

discipline, the number of citations accumulated in the recent years and the tendency to cite

more recent articles aﬀect the topology of the citation network.

C. Number of articles and references

Next we consider the average number of articles published each year and study how the

increase in publications can aﬀect the total degree distribution of the network. Increasing

the number of articles and increasing the time are similar since the average number of articles

published each year in a discipline is considered constant. We ﬁnd that increasing m does

not change the topology of the network. It only changes the numerical values obtained in

the ﬁnal degree distribution. The number of references cited by each article on the other

hand does aﬀect the topological structure of the network. This is particularly relevant as the

number of references in diﬀerent disciplines may vary considerably. The citation distribution

is taken to be a Weibull distribution with the shape parameter 2 and the scale parameter

b = 5. The number of references k0 considered are 20, 40, 80, and 120. Though review

articles can have a much larger number of references, we consider the maximum value of 120

since the number of articles generated per year in our case is kept constant at 200.

Fig. 5 gives the total degree distribution for diﬀerent values of k0. We ﬁnd that a change

in the number of references aﬀects the network structure. For smaller number of references

the degree distribution can be described by a stretched exponential. As the average number

of references increase, the distribution becomes exponential in nature (dashed curve in Fig.

5). Similar results are obtained for b = 20 and for the lognormal distribution. These indicate

that the citation networks of two disciplines which have diﬀerent citation practices will have

diﬀerent topological structure. The discipline which has a larger number of references per

article will have deviations from the scale free structure and the total degree distribution

will be given by an exponential instead of a power law.

IV. REAL-WORLD CITATION DISTRIBUTIONS

We now discuss how our model relates to the various results obtained previously from

diﬀerent data sets. For a ﬁnite time period, we have identiﬁed three major parameters which

determine the citation pattern in a discipline. These are (i) the number of references per

article (ii) the average age at which articles get their maximum citations and (iii) the rate

at which the article accumulates citations in the initial years after publication. This rate is

given by the rise in the citation lifetime curve and determines which distribution would be

a better ﬁt to the discipline. The study of the citation network of the Scientometric journal

[9] over a 26 year time period generates two power laws with diﬀerent scaling coeﬃcients.

As the authors point out, the number of articles published each year is relatively constant

10

over this period. So the deviations here are mostly due to the diﬀerence in the number of

references per article. They also ﬁnd that the journal had a large number of self-referencing

in the ﬁrst year. This went down steeply immediately after the ﬁrst year and then increased

steadily over time in the next 25 years. According to our model, as the number of references

per article increases, the slope of the degree distribution on a logarithmic scale becomes

steeper. So the change in the power law coeﬃcient in the degree distribution could be due

to the increase in the number of references within the journal. Results obtained from the

SPIRES database [7] also show that the degree distribution in high energy physics can be

ﬁtted by two power laws independent of each other. As mentioned previously, the total

degree distribution obtained from the Weibull distribution with shape parameter a = 2 and

scale parameter b = 5 can also be ﬁtted by two power laws independent of each other.

These values of the parameters are not unique, other combinations also generate similar

curves but with diﬀerent scaling coeﬃcients. So it may well be that the citation pattern

in each of these datasets are ﬁt with a Weibull or lognormal distribution with diﬀerent

parameters. Our motivation for using lifetime distributions to illustrate the importance of

citation pattern on network evolution is largely theoretical. For a better validation of the

model it is necessary to obtain the distribution from an actual dataset and ﬁt a probability

distribution. The parameters obtained from the ﬁt can then be used to predict the degree

distribution of the ﬁnal network. We do this for citations obtained from the Physical Review

D journal.

The degree distribution of the citation network for the Physical Review D journal has

previously been analyzed extensively [10, 14, 15]. However the citation pattern has not been

obtained before. We obtain the citation pattern by plotting the number of citations received

by an article against the age of the article. This data is then normalized and ﬁtted with a

probability distribution. Fig. 6 gives the plot. The probability distribution turns out to be

a lognormal distribution with the parameters a = 1.1 and b = 1.7.

Once f (t

t0) is obtained, we calculate the citation probability from Eq. 7. We plot

−

this in Fig. 7. Since we are considering references in Physical Review D journals only, we

take the average number of articles published per year to be 1000. The Physical Review D

started in 1970. In the initial years of publication, the average number of articles was very

low (about 300) but in recent years the number has increased to around 2000. Since our

average number of articles generated each year remains constant throughout the time period

considered (1970 - 2004), we take m = 1000. To obtain a scaling co-eﬃcient of

3 in the

−

tail region (as obtained in Ref.[14]) with m = 1000, we ﬁnd that the number of references

should be 4. The total degree distribution and the power law with an exponent of -3.0 is

shown in Fig. 7.

Since an average number of references of 4 seemed quite small, we went back to the dataset

and examined the references in the journal Physical Review D. A random sampling indicated

that the initial articles in the journal have few or no citations. Later articles have an average

of 20 references per article but most of the articles cited are published in other journals. The

12

average number of references to Physical review D is less than 10. The citation lifetime was

obtained from the references from articles published in the Physical Review D irrespective

of where the cited article was published. However, the degree distribution in Ref.[14] did not

include citations to articles outside the Physical Review journals. So the average number

of references does not seem anomalous. It is the average number of references to Physical

Review journals in Physical Review D. Since many of the initial articles in the journal had

references to journals cited outside the Physical Review, the average number of references

in the total time period is reduced.

In our model we have considered the number of articles published and the average number

of references per article to be constant throughout the time period. This is not true for real

world citation data. We have shown that changing the number of references changes the

scaling coeﬃcient, since in the real world data set these number keep changing, it becomes

diﬃcult to ﬁt any citation data with an unique power law. This is further illustrated in

Lehmann’s work [7], where he plots the degree distribution for the total SLAC SPIRES

database and also plots the degree distribution separately for the subﬁelds in the database.

The citation pattern in the subﬁelds being more homogeneous, the degree distribution here

can be ﬁt by two power laws whereas the degree distribution for the entire database can be

ﬁt by multiple power laws.

V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We have presented an analytical model for an evolving citation network that takes into

account the citation pattern in a particular discipline. Though earlier models have considered

the aging of articles and preferential attachment, our model is the ﬁrst to include deﬁnite

characteristics that deﬁne the citation pattern in a discipline. Apart from the citation

pattern, we also include the number of articles published per year. We ﬁnd that all these

together determine the total degree distribution of the network.

We propose modeling the aging probability by a lifetime distribution. Two of the most

commonly used lifetime distributions are the Weibull and the lognormal. The Weibull

distribution has been used previously in the TARL model [11]. It was used to model the

aging characteristics of the citation network obtained from the PNAS dataset. We also found

that the aging characteristics of the citation network in the Physical Review dataset ﬁts a

13

lognormal distribution. The choice of lifetime distributions to model the aging probability

is thus consistent with real datasets.

We ﬁnd that the topological structure of the network depends on the citation practices

followed in diﬀerent disciplines. Citation practices vary considerably between diﬀerent disci-

plines. The average age of the cited article and the number of references per article seem to

be the two most important factors which determine the scaling coeﬃcient of the power law.

We ﬁnd that the deviations from the power law structure are due to aging and the number

of references per article. We use the Physical Review D dataset to validate our model. We

consider an average of 1000 articles published in a year. A power law with exponent

3 is

−

obtained for an average of 4 references per article. The low number of references is not al-

together anomalous because it refers to the average number of reference to Physical Review

journals only. However, there are many assumptions in the model which may have lead to

this value. We now discuss these assumptions and discuss their impact on our model.

The probability of citation based on preferential attachment and aging are considered to

be independent of each other. Though this is an accepted assumption in modeling citation

networks, it is not true in the real world [15]. Highly cited articles will deﬁnitely have a

longer lifetime compared to the less cited articles in any discipline. In Ref. [15] the average

citation age for most Physical Review papers is found to be 6.2 years, while the average

citation age for highly cited papers is found to be 11.7 years. This means that the two

probabilities should be dependent on each other, even if the dependency is small. Since

the total degree distribution of our model depends on the citation pattern, a change in the

citation pattern will deﬁnitely change the ﬁnal structure of the network.

We have also assumed that the number of articles published each year and the number

of references per article are constant. For real world citation data neither is true. In fact in

some cases the increase in the number of articles published each year is exponential. This is

especially true for the Physical Review D journal which we have used to validate our model.

As mentioned previously, the number of articles published each year in this journal has

grown by an order of magnitude in three decades. This unfortunately is not reﬂected in our

model which considers an average value for the whole time period. However, our point was

to exemplify the importance of citation patterns in the evolution of a citation network. It

is encouraging to ﬁnd that our ﬁnal degree distribution is similar to the degree distribution

obtained in ref.[14]. While our model is able to explain the diﬀerences observed in diﬀer-

14

ent citation networks qualitatively, we hope to improve it further and make quantitative

predictions about citation patterns observed in diﬀerent disciplines.

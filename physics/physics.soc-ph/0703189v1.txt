Abstract. We study the dating market decision problem in which men and women repeatedly go out on dates and learn about
each other. We consider a model for the dating market that takes into account progressive mutual learning. This model consists
of a repeated game in which agents gain an uncertain payoff from being matched with a particular person on the other side of
the market in each time period. Players have a list of preferred partners on the other set. The players that reach higher rank
levels on the other set preferences list have also higher probability to be accepted for dating. A question can be raised, as
considered in this study: Can the less appreciated players do better? Two different kinds of dating game are combined "à la
Parrondo" to foster the less attractive players. Optimism seems to be highly recommendable, especially for losers.

INTRODUCTION

Matching problems where the elements of two sets have to be matched by pairs have broad implications in economic
and social contexts. As possible applications one could think of job seekers and employers, lodgers and landlords,
or simply men and women who want to date. Standard models of matching in economics [1] almost always assume
that each agent knows his or her preferences over the individuals on the other side of the market. This assumption,
generally associated with neo-classical economics, is too restrictive for many markets, and some interesting work
on matching problems with partial information has recently been published [2, 3]. Speciﬁcally, perfect information
supposition is very far from being a good approximation for the dating market, in which men and women repeatedly
go out on dates and learn about each other. Recently, a model for the dating market that takes into account progressive
mutual learning was introduced by Das and Kamenica [4]. This model consists of a repeated game in which agents
gain an uncertain payoff from being matched with a particular person on the other side of the market in each time
period. The problem is related to bandit problems [5], in which an agent must choose which arm of an n-armed bandit
to pull in order to maximize long-term expected reward, taking into account the tradeoff between exploring, that is
learning more about the reward distribution for each arm, and exploiting, pulling the arm with the maximum expected
reward. However, in Das and Kamenica model the arms themselves have agency - they can decide whether to be
pulled or not, or whom to be pulled by, and they themselves receive rewards based on who the puller is. This motivates
Das and Kamenica formulation of the problem as a "two-sided" bandit problem.

The matching problems describe systems where two sets of persons have to be matched pairwise. Players have a list
of preferred partners on the other set. The players that reach higher rank levels on the other set preferences list have
also higher probability to be accepted for dating. An interesting question is: Can the less appreciated players do better?
In other words: Can the usual dating game losers achieve a better performance? A possible way to accomplish this goal
may be the phenomenon known in the literature as Parrondo’s paradox [6], devised in 1996 by the Spanish physicist
Juan M.R. Parrondo, where the alternation of two fair (or losing) games can result in a winning game. Although
initially introduced as individual games, multiplayer versions of the paradox, played by a set of N players, have also
been studied [7, 8]. In these collective games, a set of N players are arranged in a ring and each round a player is
chosen randomly to play either game A or B. The game A is a simple coin tossing game, where the player wins or loses
one unit of capital with probabilities pA and 1 − pA, respectively in [7], and a redistribution process where a player is
chosen randomly to give away one coin of his capital to another player in [8]. Game A is combined with game B, for
which the winning probability depends on the state (winner/loser) of the nearest neighbors of the selected player. A
player is said to be a winner(loser) if he has won(lost) his last game. Recently [9] a new version of collective games
was introduced, where besides obtaining the desired result of a winning game out of two fair games, another feature
appears: the value of the A/B mixing probability g determines whether you end up with a winning or a losing game

A + B. In each round, a player is selected randomly for playing. Then, with probabilities g and 1 − g , respectively,
game A or B is played. Game A is the original coin tossing game. The winning probabilities in game B depend on the
collective state of all players. More precisely, the winning probability can have three possible values, determined by
the actual number of winners w within the total number of players N, in the following way

In this paper we consider a repeated mixing of two different dating games based on both Das and Kamenica learning
dating model and on the last version [9] of collective Parrondo games to analyze the possibility that the less attractive
players do better. Both dating games are assumed to be fair. For the sake of clarity let us imagine that the different
games that we call A and B are played in different places with different rules. In game A, the probability that the man
proposal be accepted is modelled by coin tossing, that is pA = 1/2. This does not necessarily mean that every woman
ﬂips actually a coin, but it can be thought that all the variables not considered to construct the preference list, such as
woman’s mood, man’s way, or the group size dependance of females selectivity [10] are contributing to the probability
of acceptance pA. On the other hand, the probability of acceptance for game B, pB, depends on the number of previous
winners within all players. This collective inﬂuence may seem not so clear at ﬁrst sight, but it may be thought that in
pB collective moods contribute, such as if all woman’s friends are dating, that particular woman is better disposed to
accept man’s proposal to go out. This is the well known herdbehavior that is present in stock market bubbles as well
as in everyday decision making.

THE MODEL

There are N men and N women, who interact for T time periods. vm
is
the value of man i to every woman. These values are constant through time. In each period, a man i is chosen randomly
from the N possible men. The expected i′s payoff of dating woman j:

The Man’s Decision Problem

The top ranked woman from the list of preferred partners of i is selected to ask out for a date. The rank levels of the
preference list are distributed according to the expected i′s payoff of dating woman j (2). The man i acts in a greedy
way asking out woman j at the top of his preference list.

The Woman’s Decision Problem

The rank levels of the women preference lists are distributed according to the expected woman j′s payoff of dating

man i (3). The woman’s decision problem depends on the game:

In both games women have to consider the exploration-exploitation tradeoff. Exploitation means maximizing
expected reward (greedy choice). Exploration happens when the player selects an action with lower expected payoff
in the present in order to learn and increase future rewards. One of the simplest techniques used for bandit problems
is the so-called e -greedy algorithm. This algorithm selects the arm with highest expected value with probability 1 − e
and otherwise selects a random arm. We will use slightly changed versions of the e -greedy algorithm in both games.
In game A the exploration-exploitation tradeoff depends on coin tossing, that is the woman accepts the man’s i offer
to date with probability pA = 1/2 (exploration) or she acts greedily and goes out with her best payo f fw choice with
probability 1 − pA = 1/2.

Game A

Game B

In game B the choice of exploration or greedy behavior depends on the collective state of all men players. A man
player is said to be a winner or a loser when he got his date or not, respectively, in his last game. More precisely,
the winning or exploration probability can have three possible values, determined by the actual number of winners w
within the total number of players N, in the following way

pB = exploration probability in gameB = 

played alone and games A and B switched with mixing probability g = 1/2. In the ﬁrst case, the fairness of game B is
veriﬁed when half of all attempts produce a match. When A + B are played, the paradox produces that more than half
of all attempts are successful, as can be seen in Fig. 1b.
On the other hand, less favored players, i.e. the lowest vw ones, have an evolution that is shown in Fig. 2, for game B
played alone and games A and B switched with mixing probability g = 1/2. In this Figure the advantage of playing
A + B over B for losers can be appreciated. The comparison with game A is esentially the same for all the results
studied.

Optimistic Results

Das and Kamenica propose as an alternative method to obtain asymptotic stability in their model for dating couples
to suppose that players are initially optimistic and their level of optimism declines over time. As they say “This is
another form of patience - a willingness to wait for the best - and it should lead to more stable outcomes" [4]. A
systematic overestimate of the probability that the dating offer will be accepted is used to represent optimism.
Let us analyze optimistic players performance at our dating games model. At time t optimistic players use the

The results are highly dependent on both, the number N of players and the mixing probability g of the games A and
B. As thoroughly explained on [9], the losing or winning character of the mixed A + B games depends on N and g . We
will present in a more extensive way the dependance on the number N of players and the mixing probability g of the
games A and B elsewhere.

N and g dependance

CONCLUSIONS

We ﬁnd a way for less qualiﬁed dating game players to improve their performance by means of a repeated mixing of
two different dating games A and B based on a recent dating market model [4] and on a recent collective game version
of Parrondo’s paradox [9]. In game A, the probability associated to exploration-exploitation tradeoff, that the man
proposal be accepted is modelled by coin tossing, that is pA = 1/2. On the other hand, the probability of acceptance
for game B depends on the collective state of the men set obtained through the number of previous winners within all
players. We show that losers beneﬁt from Parrondo mixing of both games A and B. In the optimistic version of our
model, when it is assumed that players are initially optimistic and their level of optimism declines over time, loser
acceptance increase by a factor 10 and the paradoxical advantage of playing A + B over B or A for losers is conserved.
The results are highly dependent on both, the number N of players and the mixing probability g of the games A and B.

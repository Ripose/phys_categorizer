Abstract

We introduce a microscopic model which describes the dynamics of each dealer
in multiple foreign exchange markets, taking account of the triangular arbitrage
transaction. The model reproduces the interaction among the markets well. We
explore the relation between the parameters of the present microscopic model and
the spring constant of a macroscopic model that we proposed previously.

1 Introduction

Analyzing correlation in ﬁnancial time series is a topic of considerable in-
terest [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18]. We recently pointed out
[19,20,21] that, in the foreign exchange market, a correlation among exchange
rates can be generated by triangular arbitrage transactions. The triangular
arbitrage transaction is a ﬁnancial activity that takes advantage of the three
foreign exchange rates among three currencies [19,22,23]. It makes the product
of the three foreign exchange rates converge to its average, thereby generating
an interaction among the rates.

In order to study eﬀects of the triangular arbitrage on the ﬂuctuations of
the exchange rates, we introduced [19] a stochastic model describing the time
evolution of the exchange rates with an interaction. The model successfully

described the ﬂuctuation of the data of the real market. The model is phe-
nomenological; i.e. it treats the ﬂuctuations of the rates as ﬂuctuating particles
and the interaction among the rates as a spring. We refer to this model as the
‘macroscopic model’ hereafter.

The purpose of this paper is to understand microscopically eﬀects of the tri-
angular arbitrage on the foreign exchange market. For the purpose, we intro-
duce a new model which focuses on each dealer in the markets; we refer to
the new model as the ‘microscopic model’ hereafter. We then show the rela-
tion between the macroscopic model and the microscopic model through an
interaction strength which is regarded as a spring constant.

The paper is organized as follows. We ﬁrst review the macroscopic model
of the triangular arbitrage in Section 2. Second, in Section 3, we introduce
the microscopic model which focuses on the dynamics of each dealer in the
markets. The model reproduces the interactions among the markets well. We
explore the relation between the spring constant of the macroscopic model
and the parameters in the microscopic model in Section 4. We summarize the
paper in Section 5.

2 Review of macroscopic model of triangular arbitrage

The triangular arbitrage is a ﬁnancial activity that takes advantage of three
exchange rates. When a trader exchanges one Japanese yen to some amount
of US dollar, exchanges the amount of US dollar to some amount of euro and
exchanges the amount of euro back to Japanese yen instantly at time t, the
ﬁnal amount of Japanese yen is given by

Here, ‘bid’ and ‘ask,’ respectively, represent the best bidding prices to buy
and to sell in each market. If the rate product µ is greater than unity, the
trader can make proﬁt through the above transaction. This is the triangular
arbitrage transaction. Once there is a triangular arbitrage opportunity, many
traders will make the transaction. This makes µ converge to a value less than

unity, thereby eliminating the opportunity. Triangular arbitrage opportunities
nevertheless appear, because each rate ri ﬂuctuates strongly.

The probability density function of the rate product µ has a sharp peak and
fat tails (Fig. 1). It means that the ﬂuctuations of the exchange rates have
correlation that makes the rate product converge to its average hµi ≃ 0.99998.
The average is less than unity because of the spread; the spread is the diﬀerence
between the ask and the bid prices and is usually of the order of 0.05% of the
price.

For later convenience, we here deﬁne the logarithm rate product ν as the
logarithm of the product of the three rates:

ν(t) = ln

ln rx(t).

data. We ﬁx the time step at
T = 60 [sec] and hence use the
spring constant k = 0.17 for our
simulation. The simulation data
ﬁt the real data well.
In one of our previous works [19], we constructed a stochastic model of the
time evolution of foreign exchange rates that takes account of the eﬀect of the
triangular arbitrage transaction. The basic equation of the model is the time
evolution of the logarithm of each rate:

model
[24]. The three random
walkers with the restoring force
working on the center of gravity.

ln rx(t + T ) = ln rx(t) + ηx(t) + g(ν(t)),

(x = 1, 2, 3)

(10)

where T is a time step which controls the time scale of the model; we later use
the actual ﬁnancial data every T [sec]. The variable ηx denotes an independent
ﬂuctuation that obeys a truncated L´evy distribution [9,6,25] and g represents
an interaction function deﬁned by

g(ν) = −k(ν − hνi),

(11)

where k is a positive constant which speciﬁes the interaction strength and hνi
is the time average of ν. The time-evolution equation of the logarithm rate
product ν is given by summing Eq. (10) over all x:

ν(t + T ) − hνi = (1 − 3k)(ν(t) − hνi) +

ηx(t).

(12)

Xx=1

The model equation (12) well describes a fat-tail probability distribution of
ν(t) of the actual market (Fig. 2) [19] as well as a negative auto-correlation of
the price ﬂuctuation [20].

From a physical viewpoint, we can regard [24] the model equation (10) as
a one-dimensional random walk of three particles with a restoring force, by
interpreting ln rx as the position of each particle (Fig. 3). The logarithm rate

product ν is the summation of ln rx, hence is proportional to the center of
gravity of the three particles. The restoring force g(ν) makes the center of
gravity converge to a certain point hνi. The form of the restoring force (11) is
the same as that of the harmonic oscillator. Hence we can regard the coeﬃcient
k as a spring constant.

The spring constant k is related to the auto-correlation function of ν as follows
[19]:

1 − 3k = c(T ) ≡

hν(t + T )ν(t)i − hν(t)i2
hν(t)2i − hν(t)i2

.

(13)

Using Eq. (13), we can estimate the spring constant k(T ) from the real data
series as a function of the time step T (Fig. 4). The spring constant k increases
with the time step T . We ﬁxed the time step at T = 60[sec] and hence used
the spring constant k = 0.17 for our simulation. We will come back to this
point later in Section 4.

3 Microscopic model of triangular arbitrage

We here introduce a microscopic model which describes interactions among
foreign exchange markets. The model focuses on the dynamics of each dealer
in the market.

In order to describe each foreign exchange market microscopically, we use Sato
and Takayasu’s dealer model (the ST model) [26], which reproduces the power-
law behavior of price changes in a single market well. Although we focus on the
interactions among three currencies, two of the three markets can be regarded
as one eﬀective market [21]; i.e. the yen-euro rate and the euro-dollar rate are
combined to an eﬀective yen-dollar rate. In terms of the macroscopic model, we
can redeﬁne a variable r2 as the product of r2 and r3. Then the renormalized

illustrated in order to simplify the image. The circles denote the dealers’ bidding
price to buy and the squares denote the dealers’ bidding price to sell. The ﬁlled
circles denote the best bidding price to buy, max{Bi}, and the gray squares denote
the best bidding price to sell, min{Bi}+Λ. In (a), the condition (15) is not satisﬁed,
and the dealers, following Eq. (17), change their relative positions by ai. Note that
the term c∆P does not depend on i; hence it does not change the relative positions
of dealers but change the whole dealers’ positions. In (b), the best bidders satisfy
the condition (15). The price P is renewed according to Eq. (16), and the buyer
and the seller, respectively, become a seller and a buyer according to Eq. (18).

variable r2 follows a similar time-evolution equation. We therefore describe
triangular arbitrage opportunities with only two interacting ST models.

3.1 Sato and Takayasu’s dealer model (ST model)

We ﬁrst review the ST model brieﬂy [26] (Fig. 5). The basic assumption of
the ST model is that dealers want to buy stocks or currencies at a lower price
and to sell them at a higher price. There are N dealers; the ith dealer has
bidding prices to buy, Bi(t), and to sell, Si(t), at time t. Let us assume that
the diﬀerence between the buying price and the selling price is a constant
Λ ≡ Si(t) − Bi(t) > 0 for all i, in order to simplify the model.

The model assumes that a trade takes place between the dealer who proposes
the maximum buying price and the one who proposes the minimum selling
price. A transaction thus takes place when the condition

max{Bi(t)} ≥ min{Si(t)}

(14)

or

max{Bi(t)} − min{Bi(t)} ≥ Λ
is satisﬁed, where max{·} and min{·}, respectively, denote the maximum and
the minimum values in the set of the dealers’ buying threshold {Bi(t)}. The
logarithm of the rates in the actual market, − ln rx and ln r′
x, correspond to
max{Bi} and min{Si}, respectively.

(15)

6

The market price P (t) is deﬁned by the mean value of max{Bi} and min{Si}
when the trade takes place. The price P (t) maintains its previous value when
the condition (15) is not satisﬁed:

P (t) =

(max{Bi(t)} + min{Si(t)})/2,
P (t − 1),

if the condition (15) is satisﬁed,
otherwise.

(16)






The dealers change their prices in a unit time by the following deterministic
rule:

Bi(t + 1) = Bi(t) + ai(t) + c∆P (t),

(17)

where ai(t) denotes the ith dealer’s characteristic movement in the price at
time t, ∆P (t) is the diﬀerence between the price at time t and the price at
the time when the previous trade was done, and c(> 0) is a constant which
speciﬁes dealers’ response to the market price change, and is common to all
of the dealers in the market. The absolute value of a dealer’s characteristic
movement ai(t) is given by a uniform random number in the range [0, α) and
is ﬁxed throughout the time. The sign of ai is positive when the ith dealer is
a buyer and is negative when the dealer is a seller. The buyer (seller) dealers
move their prices up (down) until the condition (15) is satisﬁed. Once the
transaction takes place, the buyer of the transaction becomes a seller and the
seller of the transaction becomes a buyer; in other words, the buyer dealer
changes the sign of ai from positive to negative and the seller dealer changes
it from negative to positive:

ai(t + 1) =

−ai(t)
ai(t)

for the buyer and the seller,
for other dealers.

(18)






The initial values of {Bi} are given by uniform random numbers in the range
(−Λ, Λ). We thus simulate this model specifying the following four parameters:
the number of dealers, N; the spread between the buying price and the selling
price, Λ; the dealers’ response to the market price change, c; and the average
of dealers’ characteristic movements in a unit time, α.

The ST model well reproduces the power-law behavior of the price change
when the dealers’ response to the market change c > c∗, where c∗ is a critical
value to the power-law behavior. The critical point depends on the other
parameters; e.g. c∗ ≃ 0.25 for N = 100, Λ = 1.0 and α = 0.01 [26].

3.2 Microscopic model of triangular arbitrage: interacting two systems of the

ST model

We now describe our microscopic model as a set of the ST models. In order
to reproduce eﬀects of the triangular arbitrage, we prepare two systems of the
ST model, the market X and the market Y . As is noted above, we prepare
only two markets to reproduce the eﬀect of the triangular arbitrage because
we regard two of the three markets as one eﬀective market.

The dealers in the markets X and Y change their bidding prices according to
the ST model as follows:

Bi,X(t + 1) = Bi,X(t) + ai,X(t) + c∆PX(t) and
Bi,Y (t + 1) = Bi,Y (t) + ai,Y (t) + c∆PY (t),

(19)
(20)

where X and Y denote the markets X and Y , respectively. An intra-market
transaction takes place when the condition

max{Bi,x(t)} ≥ min{Si,x(t)},

x = X or Y

(21)

is satisﬁed. We assume that Λ is common to the two markets. The price Px(t)
is renewed in analog to the ST model:

Px(t) =




(max{Bi,x(t)} + min{Si,x(t)})/2,
Px(t − 1),

if the condition (21) is satisﬁed,
otherwise,


where x = X or Y .

We here add a new inter-market transaction rule which makes the systems
interact. The arbitrage transaction can take place when one of the conditions

νX ≡ max{Bi,X(t)} − (min{Bi,Y (t)} + Λ) ≥ 0
νY ≡ max{Bi,Y (t)} − (min{Bi,X(t)} + Λ) ≥ 0

is satisﬁed (see Fig. 6). When the conditions (21) and (23) or (24) are both
satisﬁed simultaneously, the condition (21) precedes.

Note that the arbitrage conditions νX ≥ 0 and νY ≥ 0 in the microscopic model
correspond to the arbitrage condition ν ≥ 0 in the actual market, where ν is
deﬁned by Eq. (5). We assume that the dealers’ bidding prices {Bi} and {Si}
correspond to the logarithm of the exchange rate, ln ri. Therefore, max{Bi,X}
may be equivalent to − ln(yen-dollar ask) while min{Si,Y } may be equivalent
to ln(dollar-euro ask) − ln(yen-euro bid), and hence νX may be equivalent to
ν. More precisely, the direction of the arbitrage transaction determines which
of the quantities, νX or νY , corresponds to the logarithm rate product ν. There

are illustrated in order to simplify the image. The circles and the squares denote
the dealers’ bidding price to buy and to sell. The ﬁlled circles denote the best
bidding prices to buy in the markets, max{Bi,X } and max{Bi,Y }, and the gray
squares denote the best bidding prices to sell in the markets, min{Bi,X } + Λ and
min{Bi,Y } + Λ. In the case (a), any of the conditions (21), (23) and (24) are not
satisﬁed. The buyers move their prices up, and the sellers move their prices down.
In the case (b), the dealers in the market X satisfy the condition (21); hence the
intra-market transaction takes place. The price in the market X, PX , is renewed,
and the buyer and the seller of the transaction become a seller and a buyer, respec-
tively. In the case (c), the seller in the market X and the buyer in the market Y
satisfy the condition (24); hence the arbitrage transaction takes place. The price
PX in the market X becomes min{Bi,X } + Λ, and the price PY in the market Y
becomes max{Bi,Y }. The buyer and the seller of the transaction become a seller and
a buyer, respectively. The arbitrage transaction thus makes the interaction between
the markets X and Y .

are two directions of the triangular arbitrage transaction. The deﬁnition (5)
speciﬁcally has the direction of Japanese yen to US dollar to euro to Japanese
yen. As is mentioned in Section 2, we can deﬁne another logarithm rate product
ν′ in the actual market which has the opposite direction to ν, Japanese yen
to euro to US dollar to Japanese yen. Hence, if the logarithm rate product ν
in the actual market corresponds to νX in Eq. (23), ν′ corresponds to −νY in
Eq. (24).

The procedures of the simulation of the microscopic model are as follows

each graph.

(Fig. 6):

(1) Prepare two systems of the ST model, the market X and the market
Y , as described in Section 3.1. The parameters are common to the two
systems.

(2) Check the condition (21) and renew the prices by Eq. (22). If the condition
(21) is satisﬁed, skip the step 3 and proceed to the step 4. Otherwise,
proceed to the step 3.

(3) Check the arbitrage conditions (23) and (24). If the condition (23) is satis-
ﬁed, renew the prices PX(t) and PY (t) to max{Bi,X(t)} and min{Bi,Y (t)}+
Λ, respectively. If the condition (24) is satisﬁed, renew the prices PX(t)
and PY (t) to min{Bi,X(t)} + Λ and max{Bi,Y (t)}, respectively. If both of
the conditions in (23) and (24) are satisﬁed, choose one of them with the
probability of 50% and carry out the arbitrage transaction as described
just above. If the arbitrage transaction takes place, proceed to the step
4; otherwise skip the step 4 and proceed to the step 5.

(4) Calculate the diﬀerence between the new prices and the previous prices,
∆PX(t) = PX(t) − PX(t − 1) and ∆PY (t) = PY (t) − PY (t − 1), and use
them in the Eqs. (19) and (20), respectively. Change the buyer and the
seller of the transaction to a seller and a buyer, respectively. In other
words, change the signs of ai,X and ai,Y of the dealers who transacted.
(5) If any of the conditions (21), (23) and (24) are not satisﬁed, maintain
the previous prices, PX(t) = PX(t − 1) and PY (t) = PY (t − 1), as well
as the previous price diﬀerences, ∆PX(t) = ∆PX(t − 1) and ∆PY (t) =
∆PY (t − 1).

(6) Change the dealers’ bidding prices following Eqs. (19) and (20).
(7) Repeat the steps from 2 to 6.

The quantities νX and νY are shown in Fig. 7. (Following Ref. [26], we set

and Λ = 1.0.) In Fig. 7(b) for c = 0.3, the fat-tail behavior of the price
diﬀerence νX is consistent with the actual data as well as with the macroscopic
model in Fig. 2. Furthermore, νX reproduces the skewness of the actual data,
which cannot be reproduced by the macroscopic model (Fig. 8). Note that the
skewness of νY is consistent with the behavior of ν′.

4 The microscopic parameters and the macroscopic spring con-

stant

In this Section, we discuss the relation between the macroscopic model and
the microscopic model through the interaction strength, or the spring constant
k.

In the microscopic model, we deﬁne the spring constant kmicro, which corre-
sponds to the spring constant k of the macroscopic model, as follows:

kmicro ≡

1 −

2  

hνX(t + 1)νX(t)i − hνX(t)i2
hνX(t)2i − hνX(t)i2

.

Figure 9 shows the estimate (25) as a function of several parameters.

shows the dependence on N . The other parameters are ﬁxed to Λ = 1.0 and
α = 0.0001, 0.001 and 0.01 for the circles, the squares and the diamonds, respec-
tively, and c = 0.3 for all the plots. The panel (b) shows the dependence on α. The
other parameters are ﬁxed to Λ = 1.0 and N = 100, 1000 and 10000 for the circles,
the squares and the diamonds, respectively, and c = 0.3 for all the plots.

Remember that, in the macroscopic model, the spring constant k depends on
the time step T (see Fig. 4). The spring constant of the microscopic model
kmicro also depends on a time scale as follows. The time scale of the ST model
may be given by the following combination of the parameters [26]:

(26)

(27)

3Λ
Nα

,

f ≡ 1/hni ≃

Nα
3Λ

,

where n denotes the interval between two consecutive trades. Hence, the in-
verse of Eq. (26),

is the frequency of the trades.

Although there are four parameters N, α, Λ and c, we change only three
parameters N, α, and c and set Λ = 1.0, because only the ratios N/Λ and
α/Λ are relevant in this system. The ratio N/Λ controls the density of the
dealers and α/Λ controls the speed of the dealers’ motion on average. Hence,
we set Λ = 1.0 and change the other parameters hereafter.

We plot the spring constant kmicro as a function of the trade frequency f ≡
Nα/3Λ in Fig. 10. The plots show that the spring constant kmicro(N, α, Λ) can
be scaled by the trade frequency f well.

In order to determine a reasonable range of the parameters, let us consider the
situation in Fig. 11, where the arbitrage transaction is about to take place.
At the moment, the positions of the second best bidders (hexagons) in the
markets X and Y are, on average, Λ/N away from the prices transacted, PX

dealers’ response to the price change, c, is ﬁxed to 0.0 in (a) and 0.3 in (b). We
ﬁx α = 0.0001, 0.001 and 0.01 and change N (open circles, squares, and diamonds,
respectively) and N = 100, 1000 and 10000 and change α (crosses, ﬁlled circles and
triangles, respectively), while Λ is ﬁxed to 1. Note that all points collapse onto a
single curve. The spring constant kmicro is scaled by f , and decays exponentially in
both of the plots (a) and (b).

and PY . In the next step, the second best bidders in the markets X and Y will
move by α/2 on average toward to the prices PX and PY , respectively. The
next transaction will be carried out probably by the second best bidders. For
α/2 > Λ/N, the prices of the transactions may move away from each other.
The arbitrage transaction cannot bind the two prices of the markets X and
Y enough and the two prices PX and PY ﬂuctuate rather freely. It is not a
realistic situation. Therefore, the condition

f =

Nα
3Λ

≤

(28)

should be satisﬁed for the real market to be reproduced. On the other side,
the simulation data have too large errors in the region f < 1/3 because the
transaction rarely occurs. We hence use the data in the region 1/3 ≤ f ≤ 2/3
hereafter.

The spring constant kmicro decays exponentially in the range 1/3 ≤ f ≤ 2/3
in both of the plots (a) and (b) of Fig. 10, having diﬀerent slopes. Hence we
assume that the spring constant decays as

kmicro ∝ e

−f /f0(c),

(29)

where f0(c) denotes the characteristic frequency dependent on c. The estimates
of the characteristic frequency f0(c) are shown in Fig. 12 as a function of c.
The characteristic frequency f0(c) thus estimated decays linearly with c. The
reason why f0(c) behaves so is an open problem.

In Fig. 13, we plot the same data as in Fig. 4, but by making the horizontal axis
the trade frequency freal. In order to compare it with Fig. 10 quantitatively, we
used the time scale Treal = 7[sec]; the interval between two consecutive trades
in the actual foreign exchange market is, on average, known to be about 7[sec]

trade frequency freal, which is consistent with that of the microscopic model
shown in Fig. 10. The real characteristic frequency in Fig. 13, however, is quite
diﬀerent from that of the microscopic model plotted in Fig. 10. This is also
an open problem.

We have so far discussed the microscopic model consisting of two ST models.
The model well describes the actual data qualitatively. We here note that we
can reproduce the actual data by preparing straightforwardly a microscopic
model consisting of three ST models (see Fig. 14).

the dashed lines represent νY . The parameters are common to the three markets as
N = 100, Λ = 1.0, α = 0.01 and (a) c = 0.0, and (b) c = 0.1. In (b) the model well
reproduces the fat-tail behavior of the actual data.

5 Summary

We ﬁrst showed in Ref. [19] that triangular arbitrage opportunities exist in the
foreign exchange market. The rate product µ ﬂuctuates around its average.
We then introduced in Ref. [19] the macroscopic model including the interac-
tion caused by the triangular arbitrage transaction. Inspite of its simpleness,
the maacroscopic model reproduced the actual behavior of the logarithm rate
product ν well. We ﬁnally introduced here the microscopic model, which con-
sists of two systems of the ST model. The microscopic model also reproduced
the actual behavior of the logarithm rate product ν well. The microscopic
model can describe more details than the macroscopic model, in particular,
the skewness of the distribution of the logarithm rate product ν. We then
explored the relation between the spring constant of the macroscopic model
and the parameters in the microscopic model. The spring constant of the mi-
croscopic model kmicro can be scaled by the trade frequency f , and it decays
exponentially with f , which is consistent with the spring constant of the actual
market k.

This paper reports results of a network theory approach to the study of the United States patent
system. We model the patent citation network as a discrete time, discrete space stochastic dynamic
system. From data on more than 2 million patents and their citations, we extract an attractiveness
function, A(k, l), which determines the likelihood that a patent will be cited. A(k, l) is approximately
separable into a product of a function Ak(k) and a function Al(l), where k is the number of citations
already received (in-degree) and l is the age measured in patent number units. Al(l) displays a peak
at low l and a long power law tail, suggesting that some patented technologies have very long-term
eﬀects. Ak(k) exhibits super-linear preferential attachment. The preferential attachment exponent
has been increasing since 1991, suggesting that patent citations are increasingly concentrated on
a relatively small number of patents. The overall average probability that a new patent will be
cited by a given patent has increased slightly during the same period. We discuss some possible
implications of our results for patent policy.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Innovation plays a key role in economic development
and the patent system is intended (and Constitution-
ally required in the United States) to promote innovative
progress. The patent system promotes innovation by giv-
ing inventors the power to exclude others from using their
inventions during the patent term. The power to exclude
is a double-edged sword, however, beneﬁting the original
inventor, but imposing costs on later innovators seeking
to build on past inventions. Thus, the proper design of
the patent system is an important matter – and a mat-
ter of considerable current debate. See, e.g., [5, 9, 12].
Advances in computer technology and the availability of
large patent databases have recently made it possible to
study aspects of the patent system quantitatively. To

date the empirical analysis of the patent system has been
undertaken by economists and some legal scholars. See,
e.g., [2, 8, 13]. Because patents and the citations between
them can be conceptualized as a growing network, how-
ever, techniques from statistical physics that have been
used in the study of complex networks can be usefully
applied to the patent citation network [1, 14]. In this pa-
per we present what we believe to be the ﬁrst results of
a network theory approach to the patent system. We ex-
plore the kinetics of patent citation network growth and
discuss some possible implications for understanding the
patent system.

The paper is organized as follows: In Section II we pro-
vide background on the United States patent system and
describe the citation data that is used in this study. In
Section III we describe a general framework for modeling
the kinetics of citation networks, deﬁne an “attractive-
ness function” for the evolving network and introduce an
iterative method for extracting the attractiveness func-
tion from the data. In Section IV we apply this approach

to analyze the US patent citation network and explore the
changes in the kinetics from 1976 to 2000. In Section V
we discuss some possible implications of our results, and
mention directions for future research.

tronic format. The Hall, Jaﬀe and Trajtenberg database
also contains additional data about the included patents,
which is described in detail in [7].

II. PATENTOLOGICAL BACKGROUND

While a similar approach could be applied to many
patent systems, including the very important European
and Japanese patent systems, we begin our analysis with
the United States patent system for which an extensive
database of citations has been made available through
the work of economists Hall, Jaﬀe, and Trajtenberg [7].
An application for a U.S. Patent is ﬁled in the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Oﬃce (USPTO). A patent ex-
aminer at the USPTO determines whether to grant a
patent based on a number of criteria, most of impor-
tant of which for present purposes are the requirements
of novelty and non-obviousness with respect to existing
technology. Once a patent is issued by the USPTO, it
is assigned a unique patent identiﬁcation number. These
numbers are sequential in order of patent grant.

Novelty and nonobviousness are evaluated by compar-
ing the claimed invention to statutorily deﬁned categories
of “prior art”, consisting in most cases primarily of prior
patents. Patents are legally eﬀective only for a limited
term (currently twenty years from the date of applica-
tion), but remain eﬀective as “prior art” indeﬁnitely. In-
ventors are required to provide citations to known ref-
erences that are “material” to patentability, but are not
required to search for relevant references (though they or
their patent attorneys often do so). During consideration
of the application, patent examiners search for additional
relevant references.

Patent citations reﬂect potential prior art that was
considered by the examiner. They thus reﬂect the judg-
ment of patentees, their attorneys, and the USPTO
patent examiners as to the prior patents that are most
closely related to the invention claimed in an application.
Patent citations thus provide, to some approximation, a
“map” of the technical relationships between patents in
the U.S. patent system. This “map” can be represented
by a directed network, the nodes being the patents and
the directed edges the citations. Our research uses a
statistical physics approach inspired by studies of other
complex networks to attempt to gain insight from that
“map”.

The patent database we use for the analysis in this pa-
per was created by Hall, Jaﬀe and Trajtenberg based
on data available from the US Patent Oﬃce [7].
It
is available online at http://www.nber.org/patents/.
The database contains data from over 6 million patents
granted between July 13, 1836 and December 31, 1999
but only reﬂects the citations made by patents after Jan-
uary 1, 1975: more than 2 million patents and over 16
million citations. Citations made by earlier patents are
also available from the Patent Oﬃce, but not in an elec-

III. MODELING PATENT CITATION
NETWORKS

A. Deﬁning the model framework

In this section we deﬁne the mathematical model
framework we will use for studying patent citations. This
framework is a discrete time, discrete space stochastic
dynamic system. Time is measured in patent number
units. We often “bin” the data from a range of patent
numbers to obtain suﬃcient statistics for the analysis. In
our model, each patent is described by two variables:

1. k, the number of citations it has received up to the

current time step and

2. l, the age of the patent, which is simply the diﬀer-
ence between the current time step (as measured
in patent numbers) and the patent number. Be-
cause a given patent may cite more than one other
patent, several citations may be made in one time
step.

These two variables deﬁne what we call the “attrac-
tiveness” of a patent, A(k, l) which determines the like-
lihood that the patent will be cited when the next ci-
tation is made. In every time step the probability that
an older patent will be cited is proportional to the older
patent’s attractiveness multiplied by the number of cita-
tions made in that time step. We ﬁnd that this simple
model gives a very good approximation of the observed
kinetics of the growth of the patent citation network.

More formally, the state of the system is described by
ki(t) and li(t), (1 < i < N ), where N is the patent
number of the last patent studied and ki(t) and li(t) are
the in-degree and age, respectively, of patent i at the
beginning of time step t. The attractiveness of any node
with in-degree k and age l is denoted by A(k, l). A(k, l)
is deﬁned such that the probability that node i will be
cited by a given citation e in time step t is given by

P [e cites node i] =

(1)

A(ki(t), li(t))
S(t)

,

where S(t) is the total attractiveness of the system at
time step t.

S(t) =

A(kj (t), lj(t)).

(2)

t

X
j=1

The total probability that node i will be cited in time
step t is thus E(t)A(ki(t), li(t))/S(t), where E(t) is the
number of citations made by patent t. A(k, l) and S(t)

are deﬁned up to an arbitrary normalization parameter.
To normalize, we arbitrarily deﬁne A(0, 1) = 1. With
this normalization, S(t) is the inverse probability that a
“new” node, with k = 0 and l = 1, will be cited by a
given citation during the next time step.

The A(k, l) function determines the evolution of the
It describes the average citation preferences

of the citing patents (the inventors and patent examin-
ers in reality).
In this study, we measure and analyze
A(k, l) for the United States patent system during the
time period covered by our data. We ﬁnd ﬁrst that the
parameterization by k and l consistently describes the av-
erage kinetics of the patent citation network. Of course,
underlying patent citations are patentee and patent ex-
aminer evaluations of the signiﬁcance of the cited patent
and the technological relationship between the citing and
cited patents that our probabilistic approach cannot cap-
ture. The way in which these “microscopic dynamics”
are translated into the average behavior that we observe
remains an open question.

In the following part of this section we will explain our
method for measuring the A(k, l) and S(t) functions for a
given network. We believe that this method may be use-
fully applied to other networks as long as the necessary
data is available.

B. Measuring the attractiveness function

Let us assume that edges are added to the system one
after another in a ﬁxed order; if two edges are added in
the same time step (i.e., by the same citing patent), their
order is ﬁxed arbitrarily for the measurement. Let e be
an edge and let ce(k, l) be indicator random variables,
one for each (e, k, l) triple, (1 < e < Etot, k ≥ 0, l > 0),
where Etot is the total number of edges in the system.
ce(k, l) is one if and only if edge e cites a (k, l) node (i.e.,
a node having in-degree k and age l) and zero otherwise.
The probability that edge e cites a (k, l) node, i.e., that
ce(k, l) is one, is thus given by

P [ce(k, l) = 1] =

N (t(e), k, l)A(k, l)
S(t(e))

(3)

where t(e) is the time step during which edge e is added,
S(t(e)) is the total attractiveness of the system right be-
fore adding edge e, and N (t(e), k, l) is the number of (k, l)
nodes in the network right before adding edge e. We thus
have a formula for A(k, l):

A(k, l) =

P [ce(k, l) = 1]S(t(e))
N (t(e), k, l)

(4)

In (4) it is easy to determine N ((t(e), k, l) for any
(e, k, l), but S(t(e)) is unknown. Moreover, we have only
a single experiment for ce(k, l) which is not enough to ap-
proximate P [ce(k, l) = 1] properly. To proceed further,
let us deﬁne a new set of random variables, each of which

3

is a simple transformation of the corresponding ce(k, l)
variable:

Ae(k, l) =

ce(k, l)S(t(e))
N (t(e), k, l)

,

if N (t(e), k, l) > 0

(5)

If N (t(e), k, l) = 0 then Ae(k, l) is not deﬁned. It is easy
to see that the expected value of any Ae(k, l) variable (if
deﬁned) is A(k, l); thus we can approximate A(k, l) by

¯A(k, l) =

the number of
N ((t(e), k, l)) > 0 for any t(e), and ¯ce(k, l) is the real-
ization of ce(k, l) in the network being studied.

edges

To calculate this approximation for A(k, l) we need
to determine S(t(e)), which itself is deﬁned in terms
of A(k, l).
To determine A(k, l) and S(t(e)) self-
consistently, we use the following iterative approach:

1. First we assume that S0(t) is constant, and use (6)
to compute A0(k, l), normalizing the values such
that A0(0, 1) = 1.

2. Then we calculate S1(t) for each t based on A0(k, l)

and use this to determine A1(k, l).

3. We repeat this procedure until the diﬀerence be-
tween Sn(t) and Sn+1(t) is smaller than a given
small ǫ for all t.

To check this iterative method, we have applied it to
various well-known models of growing networks, such as
the Barabasi-Albert model [3]. In these tests the method
yielded the correct form of the A(k, l) function, which,
for the BA-model, for example, is A(k, l) = k + a. While
these tests gave very good agreement overall they also
suggested that the method cannot accurately measure
the attractiveness of young nodes (small l) with high in-
degree (high k), as these occur very rarely in any ﬁnite
sample network.

IV. RESULTS

A. The attractiveness function

The analysis method described in the previous section
was applied to the patent citation network and the forms
of S(t) and A(k, l) were determined. Figures 1 and 2 show
sections of the A(k, l) function and Figure 3 shows S(t)
(which is also the inverse of the probability that a “new”
node with k = 0 and l = 1 will be cited). For all the
ﬁgures in this paper we have binned the age values into
300 bins, each containing 7172 patents. Ages and times
are measured in patent number units. Figures 1 and 2
suggest that, for the patent network, the eﬀects of in-
degree and age can be separated to good approximation

and that A(k, l) can be written approximately in the form

A(k, l) = Ak(k) · Al(l).

(7)

While this is a reasonable and useful approximation, it is
also clear that it is only approximately true. e.g., A(0, ·)
decays faster than A(30, ·), see the second plot in Figure
1.

The measured Al(l) function for the patent citation
network has two major features – a peak at approxi-
mately 200,000 patent numbers and a slowly decaying
tail. (The very large absolute values of Al(l) are a result
of the normalization, A(0, 1) = 1, and are of no indepen-
dent signiﬁcance.) The peak at 200,000 patent numbers
corresponds to a large number of what might be called
“ordinary”, relatively short-term citations.
In 1998–
1999, 200,000 patent numbers corresponded to about 15
months. The tail is best described by a power-law decay:
Al(l) ∼ l−β with β ≈ 1.6. The observation of this power
law decay is an important result. It indicates that while
typical citations are relatively short-term, there are a sig-
niﬁcant number of citations that occur after very long

delays. Very old patents are cited, suggesting that the
temporal reach of some innovations, which perhaps can
be described roughly as “pioneer”, is very long indeed.
Moreover, because Al(l) is approximately independent
of k – i.e., approximately the same power law decay is
observed even for small k – the power law tail of Al(l)
demonstrates that there is a signiﬁcant possibility that
patents that have gone virtually un-cited for long periods
of time will reemerge to garner citations. This slow power
law decay of Al(l) thus suggests the unpredictability of
innovative progress.

The measured Ak(k) function increases monotonically
with k, as Figure 2 suggests. Higher in-degree always
means higher attractiveness. Since the citation proba-
bility is proportional to the attractiveness, this means
that the well-known preferential attachment, or “rich get
richer” eﬀect is at work here – the more citations a patent
has received, the more likely it is to receive another. The
functional form of Ak(k) is a power law over the entire
range of k values. Ak(k) ∼ kα + a, where α = 1.19
and a = 1.11. We estimated these parameters using the
smaller values of k, for which we have more data, and
the ﬁrst 100 age bins. We then checked the results by
comparing with more extensive ﬁts.

Preferential attachment and its variations are well
studied, see the reviews by Albert and Barabasi [1] and
by Newman [14]. Linear preferential attachment (α = 1)
without aging has been shown to result in a degree distri-
bution (frequency of nodes with degree k) with a power
law tail [1, 14]. Krapivsky et al. [11] have studied nonlin-
ear preferential attachment. In the model they studied
there was no aging, A(k, l) = Ak(k) = kα + a. For a > 1,
as is observed in the patent citation network, their cal-
culations predict a condensation of node connectivity, in
the sense that with high probability most of the edges are
connected to only a small number of nodes. More specif-
ically, in their model, if (m + 1)/m < α < m/(m − 1) the
number of nodes with more than m incoming edges is ﬁ-
nite, even in an inﬁnite network. For the patent network

FIG. 3: The total attractiveness S(t) of the patent network
versus time in units of patent numbers. For ease of reference
the time in years is indicated by ﬁlled circles and vertical
lines. The left and right ﬁgures in the inset show the total
attractiveness of Model 1 and Model 2, as discussed in the text
surrounding equation (8) and (9). The left plot shows results
of simulations for λ = 1/50 (circles) and 1/5 (triangles). The
right plot shows results of simulations for µ = 1/2 (circles)
and 1 (triangles). The simulations were run for 10,000 nodes.

7/6 < α < 6/5 suggesting that, if there were no aging, the
number of patents receiving more than 6 citations would
be very small, though those patents would account for a
large fraction of all of the citations. Aging complicates
this picture, of course, and likely precludes a complete
condensation onto a few nodes. However, the fact that
the observed preferential attachment is super-linear does
indicate a tendency toward what might loosely be called
“stratiﬁcation” – many nodes with very few citations and
a few nodes with many citations.

B. The total attractiveness

The total attractiveness function, S(t), (see Fig. 3) of
the US patent system increases with time. The initial
steep increase is only a ﬁnite size eﬀect and comes from
the fact that the citations made by pre-1975 patents are
missing from our database. From about 1984 on, how-
ever, S(t) displays a slow but steady increase. One way
to interpret this increase is that the probability that a
patent will be cited by a given citation (which is propor-
tional to 1/S(t)) is decreasing as the size of the network
increases. The decrease is determined in part by the rate
at which patents age, which determines the number of
patents “available” for citation.

To better understand the behavior of the S(t) func-
tion, we simulated two simple growing network models
with two diﬀerent “toy” A(k, l) functions, with linear
preferential attachment and two diﬀerent forms of age

5

(8)

(9)

Model 1 A1(k, l) = (k + 1) · e−λl and
Model 2 A2(k, l) = (k + 1) · l−µ.

S1(t) and S2(t) were determined for these models, see
Fig. 3, inset. In these models a single edge was added to
the network at each time step.

When the attractiveness function decays exponentially
with age (Model 1), the total attractiveness ﬂuctuates
around a constant value, which is determined by λ and is
independent of the system size. In Model 1 the probabil-
ity that a new node will be cited by a particular citation
is thus always the same. The exponentially decaying age
dependence means that the eﬀect of very old nodes is
negligible; there is eﬀectively a constant-sized “band” of
recent nodes that remain “citable”. In a patent citation
system, such an exponential age dependence would im-
ply, contrary to our observations, that the importance of
innovations is short-lived.

In Model 2, the behavior of S2(t) depends on µ.
If
µ is below a limit value µ1 (which is about 1), S2(t) is
sharply increasing. If µ is between µ1 and another limit,
µ2 (which is about 1.5) S2(t) increases slowly. When
µ is higher than µ2, S2(t) ﬂuctuates around a constant
value, as does S1(t). Thus Model 2 exhibits a crossover
from a regime of slowly decaying age dependence in which
old nodes remain inﬂuential, to a regime of more rapidly
decaying age dependence in which old nodes are “forgot-
ten”. These results are in good agreement with other
theoretical studies about aging and preferential attach-
ment; see the work by Dorogovtsev and Mendes [4], Zhu
et al. [16], Klemm and Eguluz [10].

These simple models would suggest that the patent ci-
tation network (which has an aging exponent of about
1.6 – above µ2 – should have S(t) roughly constant in
time. Indeed, a third toy model with superlinear pref-
erential attachment (exponent 1.2) and power-law aging
(exponent 1.6) displayed a roughly constant S(t). How-
ever, the observed S(t) for the patent system increases
with time.

The explanation for this apparent contradiction lies
in the fact that the average number of citations made by
each patent (and hence, since we measure time in units of
patents, the number of citations made in each time step,
E(t)), has increased approximately linearly with time in
the real patent citation network, e.g., it was 4.69 in 1975
and 10.66 in 1999. See Fig. 4. A modiﬁed simulation
with superlinear preferential attachment (exponent 1.2)
and power-law aging (exponent 1.6), but with linearly
increasing number of citations per time step conﬁrmed
that, as in the real patent data, the increasing number of
citations made in each time step results in an increasing
overall attractiveness, S(t).

The probability that patent i will be cited in a given
time step (in other words, by a particular patent rather

cited by the next patent is thus given by E(t)/S(t), which
is shown in Fig. 4. From this plot one can see that the
increase in the number of citations being made outweighs
the increase in S(t), so that the probability that a new
patent will be cited has increased over time, despite the
increasing S(t). Patents do not get “lost in the crowd”
the way we might have predicted from the simple models.
Instead, patentees and patent examiners have on average
increased the number of citations made by each patent
to more than compensate for the increasing S(t).

year since 1984 [6, 9], the underlying reason for this in-
crease is not clear. Has there simply been an acceleration
of technological development in the last twenty years or
has there been a more fundamental change in the patent
system, perhaps, as many have suggested, as a result of
increased leniency in the legal standard for obtaining a
patent [9]. A complete answer to this question is far be-
yond the scope of the present investigation. However,
our kinetic model does permit us to ask whether there
has been any deep change in the growth kinetics of the
patent citation network. Because we measure time in
units of patent number, a mere acceleration of techno-
logical progress should leave A(k, l) unchanged in patent
number “time”. A change in A(k, l) indicates some other
source of change.

Thus far, we have assumed a time-independent A(k, l),
which is reasonably consistent with our observations. In
this section, we relax this assumption to ask the more
subtle question of whether there has been a change in
patent system kinetics over and above the acceleration
that is already reﬂected in our choice of time units.
Speciﬁcally, we allow α and β to vary with time and
ask whether there has been a signiﬁcant change in these
parameters between 1980 and 2000.

To answer this question we measured the parameters
of the system as functions of time. To perform the
ﬁts, we averaged over a 500,000-patent sliding time win-
dow and calculated the parameters after every 100,000
patents. The measured α parameters are plotted in Fig-
ure 5. There is a signiﬁcant variation over time. The time
dependence of the important β parameter was also ex-
plored, but no signiﬁcant time dependence was observed
to within the statistical errors.

The plot for the α parameter shows that there are two
regimes. In the ﬁrst regime, prior to about 1991, α is de-
creasing with time, while in the second, starting around
1991, there is a signiﬁcant increase. As noted earlier,
the α parameter has some very important consequences

for the growth of the network: the higher α, the more
“condensed” or “stratiﬁed” the network will be. The
increasing α in the patent citation network indicates in-
creasing stratiﬁcation – a smaller and smaller fraction of
the patents is receiving a larger and larger fraction of the
citations. This change is not simply a result of acceler-
ating numbers of patents being granted, but suggests a
more fundamental change in the distribution of patents
that are being issued.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have presented a stochastic kinetic model
for
patent citation networks. Though a complex process un-
derlies each decision by a patent applicant or examiner
to cite a particular patent, the average citation behavior
takes a surprisingly simple form. The citation probabil-
ity can be approximated quite well by the ratio of an
“attractiveness function”, A(k, l), which depends on the
in-degree, k, and age in patent numbers, l, of the cited
patent, and a time-dependent normalization factor, S(t),
which is independent of k and l.

We introduced a method to extract the A(k, l) and S(t)
functions of a growing network from a speciﬁcation of
the connection history. We applied this technique to the
patent citation network and, though no assumptions were
made as to the functional form of A(k, l), the measured
A(k, l) function was well described by two approximately
separable processes: preferential attachment as a func-
tion of in-degree, k, and power law age dependence. The
interplay of these two processes, along with the growth
in the number of citations made by each patent, governs
the emerging structure of the network. Particularly note-
worthy are our ﬁnding that the preferential attachment
is super-linear, implying that patents are highly strati-
ﬁed in “citability”, and our ﬁnding of a power law tail in
the age dependence even for small k, indicating not only
that some patents remain important for very long times,
but also that even “dormant” patents can re-emerge as
important after long delays.

We also used our technique to investigate the time de-
pendence of the growth kinetics of the patent citation
network. Overall, we ﬁnd that the increasing number
of patents issued has been matched by increasing cita-
tions made by each patent, so that the chance that a

7

new patent will be cited in the next time period has even
increased over time. This result suggests that on average
patents are not becoming less “citable”. However, we
also ﬁnd that there has been a change in the underlying
growth kinetics since 1991. Since 1991, preferential at-
tachment in the patent system has become increasingly
strong, indicating that patents are more and more strat-
iﬁed, with fewer and fewer of the patents receiving more
and more of the citations. A few very important, per-
haps “pioneer”, patents seem to dominate the citations.
This trend may be consistent with fears of an increas-
ing patent “thicket”, in which more and more patents
are issued on minor technical advances in any given area.
These technically dense patents must be cited by patents
that build upon or distinguish them directly, thus requir-
ing that more citations be made, but few of them will be
of suﬃcient signiﬁcance to merit citation by any but the
most closely related patents. Further work will be needed
to understand this change in citation network kinetics.

This work is only the beginning. There are many fur-
ther applications of network analysis to the patent cita-
tion network that are likely to bear fruit. It will be pos-
sible, for example, to compare the structural and kinetic
behavior of the network for patents in diﬀerent techno-
logical areas, to investigate the degree of relatedness be-
tween patents in seemingly disparate technologies, and to
explore more detailed structural indicators, such as clus-
tering coeﬃcients and correlation functions. Also, it may
be possible to compare the growth of patent systems in-
ternationally, perhaps providing a means to distinguish
between the eﬀects of global technological change and
those of nation-speciﬁc legal changes. Finally, it will be
interesting to compare the behavior of the patent citation
network with that of other networks (such as the scien-
tiﬁc journal citations discussed in [15]) to gain deeper
insight into the behavior of complex networks in general.

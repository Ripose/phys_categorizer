This letter propose a new model for characterizing traﬃc dynamics in scale-free networks. With
a replotted road map of cities with roads mapped to vertices and intersections to edges, and intro-
ducing the road capacity L and its handling ability at intersections C, the model can be applied to
urban traﬃc system. Simulations give the overall capacity of the traﬃc system which is quantiﬁed
by a phase transition from free ﬂow to congestion. Moreover, we report the fundamental diagram
of ﬂow against density, in which hysteresis is found, indicating that the system is bistable in a
certain range of vehicle density. In addition, the fundamental diagram is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from
single-lane traﬃc model and 2-D BML model with four states: free ﬂow, saturated ﬂow, bistable
and jammed.

Traﬃc and transportation is nowadays one of the
most important ingredients of modern society. We rely
greatly on networks such as communication, transporta-
tion and power systems. Ensuring free traﬃc ﬂow on
these networks is therefore of great research interest
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. Recently, more and
more empirical evidence indicates that these networked
systems are of small-world and scale-free structural fea-
tures [12, 13, 14, 15]. And so the traﬃc ﬂow on scale-free
networks is being widely investigated [16, 17, 18, 19, 20].
In the present work, we propose a new model for the traf-
ﬁc dynamics of such networks. The potential application
of this research will be urban (road) traﬃc networks.

Previously work on urban traﬃc normally maps roads
to edges and intersections to vertices. In 1992, Biham,
Middleton and Levine (BML) [8] proposed an ideal 2-
dimensional model for studying urban traﬃc. They used
a N × N grid to represent the urban transportation net-
work. Initially, cars are placed at the sites. Each car is
either East-facing or North-facing. At odd time steps,
each North-facing car moves one unit North if there is
a vacant site before it. At even time steps, East-facing
cars move East in the same way. The rules of BML model
can be considered as controlling urban traﬃc by traﬃc
lights. The BML model reproduced the transition from
free-ﬂow phase to jammed phase. Since then, many stud-
ies have been carried out on the base of the BML model.
For example, Nagatani [9] investigated the eﬀect of car
accident induced jam on the phase transition of urban
traﬃc; Chung et al.
[10] investigated the eﬀect of im-
properly placed traﬃc lights; and recently, Angel et al.
[11] discussed the jammed phase of the BML model.

The models mensioned above always adopt a N × N
grid (or close to that) to represent the urban traﬃc sys-

sections are mapped to edges between the vertices.

tem. However, real urban traﬃc system is obviously
much more complicated. Perhaps, the most natural way
is to map each intersection to a vertex and each segment
of road to an edge between vertices. However, obviously,
this kind of simulation is computation-consuming and the
interaction of any two neighboring segments of a straight
road is in most cases wiped oﬀ.

The unique feature of our model is that we look at the
urban traﬃc networks in a diﬀerent point of view. We
will create traﬃc ﬂow networks with roads mapped to
vertices and intersections to edges between vertices, as
was inspired by the information networks suggested in
[12] for an information view of a city. In this way(See
Fig.1), the degree k of vertex is the number of intersec-
tions along the street and a major road with many minor
roads connected to it can be seen as a major vertex. Em-
pirical observations demostrate that the remapped urban
networks exhibit scale free structural properties.

With this new paradigm, we can look at urban traﬃc
networks from a novel perspective. In network language,
a trajectory of a vehicle can then be mapped in an urban
traﬃc network map from a road (vertex) to another road
(vertex) through a one directional channel (edge) of an
intersection. In this work we will take this perspective
to the extreme, and assume that the travel time/cost of
just driving along a given road can be zero [12]. Our

model is partially inspired by the work of information
packet ﬂow on the Internet [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. The
phase transition from free ﬂow to jammed state, and the
plot of ﬂow against density that all have been empirically
observed can be well reproduced by this model.

Though the previous work found that the replotted
road networks of cities have scale-free characteristics [12],
there is no well-accepted model for these networks up to
now. Without losing generality, our simulation starts
from generating the urban transportation network ac-
cording to the most general Barab´asi-Albert scale-free
network model [14]. In this model, starting from m0 fully
connected vertices, one vertex with m edges is attached
at each time step in such a way that the probability Πi of
being connected to the existing vertex i is proportional to
the degree ki of the vertex, i.e. Πi =
, where j runs
over all existing vertices. The capacity of each vertex
(road) is controlled by two parameters: (1) its maximum
cars number L, which is proportional to its degree k (a
long road ordinarily has more intersections and can hold
more cars): L = α × k; (2) the maximum number of
cars handled per time step, which reﬂects the capability
of intersections: C = β × L. Motivated by the Internet
information ﬂow models [16, 17, 18, 19, 20], the system
evolves in parallel according to the following rules:

ki
Σj kj

1. Add Cars - Cars are added with a given rate R (cars
per time step) at randomly selected vertices and each car
is given a random destination.

2. Navigate Cars - If a car’s destination is found in
its next-nearest neighborhood, its direction will be set to
the destination vertex. Otherwise, its direction will be set
kφ
to a neighboring vertex h with probability: Ph =
.
h
Σikφ
i
Here the sum runs over the neighboring vertices, and φ is
an adjustable parameter. It is assumed that the cars are
unaware of the entire network topology and only know
the neighboring vertices’ degree ki.

3. Cars Motion – At each step, only at most C cars
can leave a vertex (road) for other vertices and FIFO
(ﬁrst-in-ﬁrst-out) queuing discipline is applied at each
vertex. When the queue at a selected vertex is full, the
vertex won’t accept any more vehicles and the vehicle
will wait for the next opportunity. Once a car arrives at
its destination, it will be removed from the system.

We ﬁrst simulate the traﬃc on a network of N = 100
vertices (roads) with m0 = m = 2, α = 5 and β = 0.2.
This relatively small system can be seen as simulating the
backbone of a city’s urban traﬃc network. The selection
of β is based on the single-road traﬃc ﬂow theory which
shows that the maximum ﬂux on a highway is about 20%
of its maximum density [4, 5, 6, 7]. For simplicity, we
do not consider the phenomenon that the ﬂux decreases
when the density is above 20%. The combination of α
and β can be also interpreted as: each intersection can
handle one car turning for one road at each step.

To characterize the system’s overall capacity, we ﬁrst
investigate the car number Nc increment rate ω in the

variation of car number Nc for diﬀerent R when φ = 0.1.
Rc(= 13) is determined at the point where the Nc increment
rate ω increases suddenly from zero and Nc increases rapidly
towards the system’s maximum car number. (b) The critical
Rc versus φ. The maximum of Rc corresponds to φ = 0.1
marked by a dash line. The data are obtained by averaging
Rc over 10 network realizations.

∆t) − Nc(t)i takes average over time windows of width
∆t. Fig.2(a) shows the variation of Nc with diﬀerent
R for φ = 0.1. One can see that there is a critical Rc
(= 13) at which Nc runs quickly towards the system’s
maximum car number and ω(R) increases suddenly from
zero. ω(R) = 0 corresponds to the cases of free ﬂow state,
which is attributed to the balance between the number
of added and removed cars at the same time. However,
if R exceeds the critical value Rc, cars will in succession
accumulate in the system and then congestion emerges
and diﬀuses to everywhere. Ultimately almost no cars
can arrive at their destinations.

Evidently, Rc is the onset of phase transition from free
ﬂow to jammed state. Hence, the system’s overall ca-
pacity can be measured by the critical value of Rc under
which the system can maintain its normal and eﬃcient
functioning. Fig.2(b) depicts the variation of Rc versus
φ. The maximum overall capacity occurs at φ = 0.1
(slightly greater than 0.0) with Rmax

= 13.

c

Here we give a heuristic analysis for determining the
optimal value of φ with the maximum capacity.
If we
neglect the queue length L of each vertex, for φ = 0, cars
will move in the system nearly like random walk. There
is a well-known result from graph theory that if a particle
performs a random walk, in the limit of long times, the
time the particle spends at a given vertex is proportional
to the degree k of the vertex [21]. One can easily ﬁnd out
that, the number of cars observed averagely at a vertex
is proportional to the degree of that vertex. Meanwhile,
the cars handling ability of each vertex is assumed to be
proportional to its degree. Thus in the case of φ = 0, this
rule produces an average eﬀect that no congestion occurs
earlier on some vertices with particular degree than on
others. Accordingly, φ = 0 results in the maximum sys-
tem capacity. However, in our model, each vertex has a
limited queue length L = α × k and R cars are gener-
ated randomly among all vertices at each time step, so
small degree vertices are slightly more easily congested.

Therefore, for our traﬃc model, a φ slightly larger than
zero can enhance the system’s capacity maximally.

Then we simulate the cars’ travel time spent in the ur-
ban transportation system. It is also an important fac-
tor for measuring the system’s eﬃciency. In Fig.3(a), we
show the average travel time hT i versus φ under traﬃc
load R = 1 and 2. In the free-ﬂow state, almost no con-
gestion on vertices occurs and the time for cars waiting in
the vertex queue is negligible, therefore, the cars’ travel
time is approximately equal to their actual path length
in replotted road map. But when the system is close
to a jammed state, the travel time will increase rapidly.
One can see that when φ is close to zero, the travel time
is minimum. In Fig.3(b) inset, the average travel time is
much longer when φ is negative than it is positive. These
results are consistent with the above analysis that a max-
imum Rc occurs when φ is slightly greater than zero. Or,
in other words, this eﬀect can also be explained as fol-
lows: when φ > 0, cars are more likely to move to the
vertices with greater degree (main roads), which enables
the main roads to be eﬃciently used and enhance the sys-
tem’s overall capability; but when φ is too large, the main
roads will more probably get jammed, and the eﬃciency
of the system will decrease.

Finally, we try to reproduce the fundamental diagram
(ﬂux-density relation) of urban traﬃc system. It is one
of the most important criteria that evaluates the transit
capacity for a traﬃc system. Our model reproduced the
phase transition and hysteresis in fundamental diagram.
To simulate a conservative system (constant density),
we count the number of arriving cars at each time step
and add the same number of cars to randomly selected
vertices of the system at the beginning of next step. The
ﬂux is calculated as the number of successful car turn-
ings from vertex to vertex through edges per step, as is
similar to the Internet information ﬂow. Here we ignore
the movement of cars on a given road. In fact, the ﬂux of
car turnings at intersections can, to some extent, reﬂect
the ﬂux on roads. In Fig.4, the fundamental diagrams
for φ = 0.1, 0.0, 1.0 and −0.5 are shown. The curves of
each diagram show four ﬂow states: free ﬂow, saturate
ﬂow, bistable and jammed. For simplicity, we focus on

φ. The data are averaged over 10 typical simulations on one
realization of network.
In each chart, the solid square line
shows the ﬂux variation when adding cars randomly to the
system (increase density), while the empty circle line shows
the ﬂux variation when drawing out cars randomly from the
system (decrease density). And the data are collected and
averaged at 10,000-11,0000 steps after the intervention when
the system has reached a steady state. The sudden transition
density values are: 0.76 and 0.45 (φ = 0.1), 0.82 and 0.76(φ =
0.0), 0.26 and 0.22 (φ = 1.0), 0.83 and 0.80 (φ = −0.5). For
diﬀerent realiazations of network, the charts are similar in
phases, but with diﬀerent transition values.

the φ = 0.1 chart in the following description. As we can
see, when the density is low (less than ≈ 0.1), all cars
move freely and the ﬂux increases linearly with car den-
sity. It is the free-ﬂow state that all vertices (roads) are
operated below its maximum handling ability C. Then
the ﬂux’s increment slows down and the ﬂux gradually
comes to saturation (0.10 ∼ 0.45). In this region, the ﬂux
is restricted mainly by handling ability C of vertices. One
can see that when φ is close to zero, the saturated ﬂux
(≈ 360) is much higher than other values.

At higher density, the model reproduces an important
character of traﬃc ﬂow - “hysteresis”.
It can be seen
that two branches of the fundamental diagram coexist
between 0.45 and 0.76. The upper branch is calculated
by adding cars to the system, while the lower branch is
calculated by removing cars from a jammed state and
allowing the system to relax after the intervention.
In
this way a hysteresis loop can be traced (arrows in Fig.4).
The hysteresis loop indicates that the system is bistable
in a certain range of vehicle density. And as we know
so far, it is the ﬁrst time that our model reproduces the
hysteresis phenomenon in scale-free network traﬃc and
in urban network traﬃc.

To test the ﬁnite-size eﬀect of our model, we simu-
late some bigger systems with much more vertices(roads).
The simulation shows similar phase transition and hys-

teresis in fundamental diagram as shown in Fig.5(a).

The ﬂux’s sudden drop to a jammed state from a
saturated ﬂow is a ﬁrst order phase transition. This
behavior can be explained by the sudden increment of
full(jammed) vertices in the system (See Fig.5(b)). Ac-
cording to the evolution rules, when a vertex is full of
cars, the cars at neighboring vertices can not turn to
it. So the cars may also accumulate on the neighboring
vertices and get jammed. This mechanism can trigger
an avalanche across the system when the car density is
high. As shown in Fig.5, the number of full vertices in-
crease suddenly at the same density where the ﬂux drop
to zero and almost no car can reach its destination. As for
the lower branch of the bistable state, starting from an
initial jammed conﬁguration, the system will have some
jammed vertices that are diﬃcult to dissipate. Clearly,
these vertices will decrease the system eﬃciency by af-
fecting the surrounding vertices until all vertices are not
jammed, thus we get the lower branch of the loop.

Moreover, an important conclusion can be drawn by
comparing the φ = 0.1 chart with the φ = 0.0 chart in
Fig.4 that the φ = 0.1 chart has a much broader bistable
region than the φ = 0.0 one. This means, when the
system retreats from a heavy load jammed state, it is
more diﬃcult to reach a high eﬃciency state if φ is greater
than zero that cars are more likely to move to main roads.
In other words, though it is wise to take full advantage
of the main roads when the entire traﬃc is light, it won’t
be so happy to do so at rush hours.

In conclusion, a new traﬃc model for scale-free net-
works is proposed. In the new perspective of mapping
roads to vertices and intersections to edges, and incorpo-
rating road/intersection capability limits, the model can
be applied to urban traﬃc system. In a systemic view
of overall eﬃciency, the model reproduces several signiﬁ-
cant characteristics of network traﬃc, such as phase tran-
sition, travel time, and fundamental diagram. A special
phenomenon - the “hysteresis” - can also be reproduced.
Although the microscopic dynamics of urban traﬃc are
not well captured, such as the movement of cars along
streets, the interaction with traﬃc lights, and the dif-
ferences between long and short streets, our model is
still a simple and good representation for urban traﬃc,
since much empirical evidence is well reproduced by the
model. Further eﬀort is deserved to consider more de-
tailed elements for better mimicking real traﬃc systems.
Moreover, by choosing other values of the parameters,
the model may be applied to other networked systems,
such as communication and power systems.

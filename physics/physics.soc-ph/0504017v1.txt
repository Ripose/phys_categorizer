We study the continuum opinion dynamics of the compromise model of Krause and
Hegselmann for a community of mutually interacting agents, by solving numerically a
rate equation. The opinions are here represented by bidimensional vectors with real-
valued components. We study the situation starting from a uniform probability distri-
bution for the opinion conﬁguration and for diﬀerent shapes of the conﬁdence range. In
all cases, we ﬁnd that the thresholds for consensus and cluster merging either coincide
with their one-dimensional counterparts, or are very close to them. The symmetry of
the ﬁnal opinion conﬁguration, when more clusters survive, is determined by the shape
of the opinion space. If the latter is a square, which is the case we consider, the clusters
in general occupy the sites of a square lattice, although we sometimes observe interesting
deviations from this general pattern, especially near the center of the opinion space.

Keywords: Sociophysics; Monte Carlo simulations.

1. Introduction

If two individuals are supporters of the same football team, they may like to
discuss about football; on the other hand, if two persons have opposite political
views, they will hardly discuss about politics. Suppose now to have two individu-
als who are fans of the same football team but support opposite political parties:
will they talk to each other or not? Will their aﬃnity in football win over their
contrasts in politics? The question sounds ambiguous: some pairs of people will
interact, others will not. What we would like to stress here is the rather obvious
fact that the tendency of people to eﬀectively communicate with each other is usu-
ally favoured by aﬃnities and hindered by contrasts. So far so good, this is basic
sociology. Indeed, Axelrod 1 had this in mind when he proposed his model for the
dissemination of culture, to explain how diﬀerent cultural islands could be gener-
ated from a local tendency to convergence. For Axelrod, ”culture” is modelized as
an array of features, each feature being speciﬁed by ”traits”, which are expressed
by integers. The number of features or dimensions is nothing but the number of
components of a vector, and two persons interact if and only if they share at least
one common feature (i.e. the same value of the corresponding vector component).
In this model, two persons are the culturally closer the more features they have in
common, and the number of common features is related to the probability of the
two individuals to interact. Starting from the Axelrod model, a number of simple
agent-based models have been devised, mostly by physicists. This should not be
surprising, as these models are essentially cellular automata, which physicists are
used to play with. Among these models we mention those of Sznajd 2, Deﬀuant et
al. 3, Krause and Hegselmann 4, Wu and Huberman 5, Pluchino et al. 6. For a
review of the recent research activity in this ﬁeld we refer to 7,8.

In this way proper physical questions could be addressed, which concern not
just the behaviour of single individuals but the collective behaviour of a commu-
nity. In fact, if the behaviour of a person is of little relevance for quantitative scien-
tiﬁc investigations, and essentially unpredictable, the global organization of many
mutually interacting subjects presents general patterns which go beyond speciﬁc
individual attributes and may emerge in several diﬀerent contexts. One can then
hope that quantities like averages and statistical distributions may characterize not
just speciﬁc situations but large classes of systems. This explains why in the last
years physicists tried to use their expertise to investigate social systems, where the
elementary interacting objects are the people (or ”agents”) and the ”charge” is rep-
resented by their opinion, although the latter is strictly speaking not a measurable
quantity.

In all above-mentioned models opinions are modelized as numbers, integer or
real. One starts by assigning randomly a number to every agent of the system.
Then the dynamics starts to act, and the agents rearrange their opinion variables,
due to mutual discussions. At some stage, the system reaches a conﬁguration which
is stable under the dynamics; this ﬁnal conﬁguration may represent consensus, with
all agents sharing the same opinion, polarization, with two main clusters of opinions

(”parties”) or fragmentation, where several opinion clusters survive. However, as
we explained at the beginning, a discussion between two persons is not simply stim-
ulated by their common view/preference about a speciﬁc issue, but it in general
depends on the global aﬃnity of the two persons, which is inﬂuenced by several
factors. So, for a more realistic modeling of opinion dynamics, one should represent
the opinions/attitudes like vectors, as Axelrod did, and not like scalars. In a forth-
coming paper 9, K. Sznajd-Weron and J. Sznajd assign two Ising-like spin variables
to each agent, referring to the opinion about a personal issue and an economic one.
In a very recent work on the Deﬀuant model 10, the opinion has several components
which are integers and the agents sit on the sites of a Barab´asi-Albert network.
However, a systematic study of the problem of multidimensional opinion dynamics
is still missing, and the aim of this paper is to try to ﬁll up this gap.

In this paper we deal precisely with this kind of problem; opinions are bidimen-
sional vectors ~S = (x, y), and the components can take any real value in some ﬁnite
interval (e.g.
[0 : 1]). Instead of formulating a new opinion dynamics, it is for us
more important to check what happens if we use one of the existing models. In this
way one can compare the results for vector opinions with those relative to standard
scalar opinions. We chose to adopt the opinion dynamics proposed by Krause and
Hegselmann 4 (KH), which has recently been subject of intense investigations 11,12.
The KH model is based on bounded conﬁdence, i.e. on the presence of a parame-
ter ǫ, called conﬁdence bound, which expresses the compatibility of agents. If the
opinions of two agents i and j diﬀer by less than ǫ, their positions are close enough
to allow for a discussion between i and j which eventually leads to a variation of
their opinions, otherwise the two agents do not interact with each other. A society,
or community, is modelized as a graph, where the vertices represent the agents and
the edges relationships between agents. So we say that two agents are friends and
could eventually talk to each other if there is an edge joining the two corresponding
vertices (in graph language, if the two vertices are neighbours).

The dynamics of the model is very simple: one chooses at random one of the
agents and checks how many neighbours of the selected agent are compatible with
it. Next, the agent takes the average opinion of its compatible neighbours. The
procedure is repeated by selecting at random another agent and so on. The type
of ﬁnal conﬁguration reached by the system depends on the value of the conﬁdence
bound ǫ. For a society where everybody talks to everybody else, consensus is
reached for ǫ > ǫc, where ǫc ∼ 0.2 12. Whereas one may expect that the value of
the consensus threshold be strictly related to the type of graph adopted to modelize
society, it turns out that it can take only one of two possible values, ǫc ∼ 0.2 and
1/2, depending on whether the average degree (= number of neighbours) of the
graph diverges or stays ﬁnite when the number of vertices goes to inﬁnity 12.

Here we want to apply the dynamics of the KH model to vector opinions, using
a continuum opinion distribution and integrating the corresponding rate equation.
We focus on a society where everybody talks to everybody else, because in this case
the evolution of the system can be described by a simple rate equation, that one

can easily solve numerically. This procedure has already been used to investigate
the compromise model of Deﬀuant et al. with one-dimensional opinions 13. The
advantages of the evolution equation over Monte Carlo simulations are that one
can (in principle) deal with a system with arbitrarily many agents and can better
resolve the crucial steps of the time evolution of the system, especially when opinion
clusters merge. Furthermore, as we will see, the ﬁnal cluster conﬁgurations obtained
for a continuum distribution will be much more symmetric and regular.

2. The model

The opinion space is represented by the points (x, y) of a bidimensional manifold,
that for us is a square: [0, 1] × [0, 1]. The continuum distribution of the opinions
among the agents is expressed by the function P (x, y, t), such that P (x, y, t)dx dy
represents the fraction of agents whose opinions have components in the intervals
[x, x + dx] and [y, y + dy]. The integral of the distribution P (x, y, t) over the whole
opinion space is of course one. The dynamics of KH, as well as that of Deﬀuant et al.,
can simply be extended to the multi-dimensional case. We must however be careful
to the deﬁnition of bounded conﬁdence, and the corresponding parametrization.
The crucial point is the concept of ”closeness” between agents. Shall one consider
the two opinion components independently or jointly? In the ﬁrst case one can
assume that two agents are compatible if either the x- or the y-components of
their opinions are close enough to each other, even if the other components are
far apart. However, in this case, the presence of several diﬀerent issues would not
represent a change with respect to the standard situation with scalar opinions. In
fact, the issues can be considered separately and each opinion component would
evolve independently of the others, so that one would just have to compose the
results obtained for each single issue. As we said in the introduction, this is not
what we would like to have, and it is not what happens in society. The closeness of
the agents depends on the general aﬃnity between them, and the aﬃnity has to do
with all issues. So, two agents are compatible if both their opinion components are
close to each other. The shape of the conﬁdence range, i. e. of the set of points in
the opinion space which represent all opinions compatible with that of some agent,
can be arbitrarily chosen: we took the two simplest cases of the square and the
circle.

We have then two possible scenarios:

1. squared opinion space, squared conﬁdence range;

2. squared opinion space, circular conﬁdence range.

The ﬁrst scenario is illustrated in Fig. 1: the large square is the opinion space,
the black dot is the opinion S of an agent A and the smaller square centered at S is
the (symmetric) conﬁdence range of the agent. All agents whose opinions lie within
the square are compatible with A and can interact with it. For the second scenario,
the square is replaced by a circle of radius ǫ. We now come to the evolution equation

Fig. 1. Simplest scenarios for our model: the opinion space is a square and the conﬁdence range
can be a square or a circle.

of the system. We start by examining the continuum version of the standard one-
dimensional KH model, in order to test the goodness of our procedure for the
numerical solution of the rate equation, by making comparisons with known results
from Monte Carlo simulations. After that, we turn to the bidimensional case.

3. Results for scalar opinions

The opinion space is the range [0, 1], the conﬁdence bound ǫ. The opinion
distribution among the agents is given by the function P (x, t). The rate equation
of the KH model is

x1−ǫ dx′ P (x′, t) (cid:17)

The two δ’s in the equation represent the only two contributions to the variation
of P (x, t) around the opinion x in the time interval [t, t + dt]. In fact, take all agents
in the range [x1, x1 + dx1], with x1 in [0, 1]. The complicated ratio of integrals
inside the ﬁrst δ is nothing but the average opinion ¯x of all agents whose opinions
are compatible with x1. As we explained above, ¯x is then precisely the new opinion
of the agents. So, whenever ¯x = x, there will be new agents with opinion in the
range [x, x + dx]. On the other hand, if x1 = x, the ﬁnal opinion will be in general
diﬀerent from x, so those agents will leave the range [x, x + dx]. The total balance
of the two contributions is expressed by the integration over all values of x1, which
cover the opinion range [0, 1].

We immediately see from the equation that the dynamics conserves the total

pretation. In fact, if we integrate both sides of Eq. (1) over x on the opinion range

where, for simplicity, we indicate with ¯x(x1, t) the ratio of integrals within the ﬁrst
δ.

If we perform the integral over the variable x on the right hand side, we see
that the only dependence on x is contained in the two δ’s; by integrating them in
the range [0, 1] they give equal contributions but opposite in sign (1 − 1 = 0). The
derivative with respect to time of the norm N (t) (left-hand side) is then zero and
the norm keeps its initial value N (0) during the whole evolution (we set N (0) = 1).
It is not so straigthforward, though relatively simple, to check that also the ﬁrst
moment of the opinion distribution, i. e. the average value of the opinion of the
system, is conserved by the dynamics. For this purpose one should multiply both
sides of Eq. (1) by x and integrate over x in [0, 1],

We remark that the KH dynamics, as well as the Deﬀuant dynamics, is sym-
metric with respect to the transformation x → 1 − x, i. e. the two wings of the
opinion range are perfectly equal, and remain equal during the whole evolution of
the system. Let us now focus on the integral on the right-hand side of Eq. (4): we
will show that it vanishes. We just need to transform the integration variable x1 in
1 − x1. We get

which means that both integrals must yield zero. The conservation of the aver-
age opinion of the community, which also holds in the model of Deﬀuant 13, has

(6)

several important consequences: for instance, if we start from a uniform opinion
distribution, P (x, t = 0) = const, for which the average opinion is 1/2, an eventual
consensus can only be reached at the central opinion 1/2. Moreover, as the ﬂat
distribution keeps the symmetry with respect to the central opinion 1/2, the ﬁnal
conﬁguration of the system will be characterized by a symmetric pattern of opinion
clusters to the right and the left of 1/2; if the number of clusters is odd, there will
necessarily be a cluster sitting exactly at x = 1/2.

Let us now come back to the rate equation (1). In order to test numerically the
behavior of the one dimensional KH model in the limit of a continuum distribution
of opinions P (x, t), we have integrated the rate equation using a standard fourth
order Runge-Kutta algorithm. The opinion range [0, 1] has been discretized in 1000
bins and the accuracy in P (x, t) was of 10−9. In all simulations we started from a
ﬂat distribution, P (x, t = 0) = const, as one usually does for these simple consensus
models. In this way, we assume that all opinions are equiprobable, as it could well
be in a community before people begin to talk to each other. The dynamics runs
until the distribution P (x, t) reaches a stationary state (with an accuracy of 10−5)
for a given value of the conﬁdence bound.

opinion range

Fig. 2. Time evolution of the opinion distribution for ǫ = 0.23. Initially the opinions condense in
a two-clusters structure, then the two clusters slowly approach each other and merge, due to the
presence of few agents with opinions lying near the center. After a long time, all agents end up in
a single big cluster centered at 1/2 (consensus).

Fig. 2 shows the time evolution of the opinion distribution, for ǫ = 0.23. One
clearly sees how the inhomogeneities at the two edges of the opinion range create a
perturbation which determines variations of the density proﬁle, with initial peaks

forming close to the edges (not reported in the plot) and others which successively
form towards the middle. This is not a peculiar feature of the KH model; the time
evolution of the opinion dynamics of Deﬀuant et al. reveals the same pattern 13.
For the chosen value of the conﬁdence bound, two main peaks form rather quickly.
However the conﬁguration is not stable, and after a longer time the two peaks fuse
in a big cluster centered at the central opinion 1/2. By looking at Fig. 2, we see
that initially the two peaks are separated by a distance which exceeds the conﬁdence
bound, so the corresponding agents are incompatible with each other and should
not interact. Why is then the two-peak conﬁguration unstable in this case? The
reason has to do with the features of KH dynamics and it can be better explained
if we speak of single agents instead of opinion distributions. In the KH model one
agent is updated at a time; as we start from a ﬂat opinion distribution, there will
be, at least initially, agents with opinions lying near the central opinion 1/2. Little
by little these agents will accept the opinion of the cluster which lies closest to it.
But suppose that one agent A lies between two diﬀerent clusters of agents, C1 and
C2, centered at the opinions s1 and s2, respectively; suppose as well that ǫ is large
enough for A to interact with the agents of C1 and C2, but smaller than |s1 − s2|.
In this case, when we come to update the opinion of the agent A, the latter will
take the average of the opinions of all agents in C1 and C2, which lies between s1
and s2. On the other hand, when we update an agent B in C1, it will be of course
compatible with all other agents in C1, but also with A though not with C2. So,
when one calculates the average of the opinions compatible with that of B, it will
not be exactly s1, but it will depart from s1 by a tiny amount towards sA. The same
happens for the agents of C2 too. In conclusion, agent A will keep lying between
the two large clusters, and the latter will slightly move towards each other due to
the intermediation of A. At some stage, the distance of the two clusters will become
smaller than the conﬁdence bound ǫ, and all agents of the system will interact with
each other, so they will all take the average opinion 1/2 of the whole system. The
process we have described shows that the KH dynamics spontaneously creates a
sort of hierarchy among agents that otherwise behave in a perfectly identical way.
Agent A could be a political leader which brings two parties to a mutual agreement.
As we have seen, the large clusters move very slowly; in the limit of inﬁnite agents,
the presence of a ﬁnite number of intermediary agents will lead a pair of clusters to
merge only after an inﬁnitely long time. This happens not only at the consensus
threshold, but for all values of ǫ for which pairs of clusters fuse according to the
mechanism we have described, like the transition from three to two ﬁnal opinion
clusters, from four to three, etc.

In the model of Deﬀuant et al., where any agent interacts at a time with only one
of its compatible agents, not with all of them, there cannot be intermediary agents.
This implies that clusters can never interact with each other if their separation in
opinion space exceeds the conﬁdence bound. This is actually the reason why the

4. Results for vector opinions

Now that we have tested the reliability of the numerical solution of the rate
equation, we can proceed with the multidimensional case. The generalization of
Eq. (1) is straightforward. For the sake of compactness, we will use the following
vector notation. The opinion vector S is represented as ~x, an n-dimensional vector
with components x1, x2, ... , xn, describing all points of the hypercube [0, 1]n. The
opinion distribution can be written as P (~x, t). In this way the rate equation can be

∗The consensus threshold for Deﬀuant, in a society where everybody speaks with everybody else,
is ǫc ∼ 0.27, in the sense that for ǫ > ǫc most agents belong to one large cluster and the others are
either isolated or form tiny groups. For ǫ > 1/2, instead, all agents end up in the same cluster,
also for other graph topologies 14.

Beware of the meaning of the symbols: the integral on the right-hand side

In the ﬁrst
multidimensional δ, to get the i-th component of the ratio of integrals one proceeds
as follows. The integrals must be both calculated within the hypervolume Ω(x1),
which for us can be a hyperbox/hypersphere centered at ~x1 and with side/diameter
2ǫ. For the i-th component of the ratio, one has to replace the term ~x0 inside the
integral at the numerator with the corresponding i-th component x0i. It takes but
a little work to show that the dynamics of Eq. (9), analogously as we have seen for
scalar opinions, conserves the zeroth and ﬁrst moments of the opinion distribution.
Eq. (9) is valid for an arbitrary number of dimensions. We will deal here only

with the bidimensional case, essentially for two reasons:

• It is computationally cheap; if we discretize each opinion component in N
intervals, the hypercube becomes a grid with N n points, and as the number
of operations is proportional to the number of points, the procedure becomes
considerably slower for higher dimensions.

• It is easy to present the results in ﬁgures, with three-dimensional or contour

plots.

4.1. Squared conﬁdence range

Let us start with a squared opinion range. We solved numerically Eq. (9) for a
few values of the conﬁdence bound ǫ, here representing the half side of the square.
As in the one-dimensional case, also this time a fourth order Runge-Kutta integrator
has been used and the simulations started from a ﬂat ditribution, P (x, y, t = 0) =
const. The squared (x, y) opinion space has been reduced to a grid of 100 × 100
bins (200 × 200 bins have been also used in some simulations, in order to better
estimate the consensus threshold) and the accuracy in P (x, y, t) was of 10−9. Even
in this case, the dynamics runs until the distribution P (x, y, t) reaches a stationary
state for a given value of the conﬁdence bound.

Fig. 4 shows how an initially ﬂat probability distribution evolves with time,
for ǫ = 0.22. We see that four major clusters are formed quite early, but after a
suﬃciently long time they fuse to a single central cluster. The reason of such long-
lived unstable states is again the fact that clusters can interact with each other
through intermediary agents, as we have seen for scalar opinions. If the conﬁdence
bound is small, we expect that many clusters survive. Fig. 5 shows that this is
indeed the case. We notice the regular structure of the ﬁnal conﬁguration; both the
opinion space and the conﬁdence range are squares, and this symmetry is reﬂected
in the opinion conﬁgurations, where the clusters sit on the sites of a square lattice.
From the ﬁgure one can see that the masses of the clusters are not equal. The
four clusters near the vertices of the opinion space are the largest, followed by the
four clusters near the centers of the edges of the square; the central cluster is the
smallest.

We have also tried to estimate the value of the consensus threshold ǫc. Our
result, ǫc = 0.215, is consistent with the corresponding value for standard one-
dimensional opinions (the consistency refers to the estimates determined through
the rate equation; Monte Carlo simulations deliver values closer to 0.2 12).

Fig. 6 shows the ﬁnal opinion conﬁgurations of the system for several values of
ǫ. The ﬁgures are contour plots of the opinion distribution after many iterations.
We notice the symmetry of the conﬁgurations: the clusters sit on the sites of a
square lattice. We also ﬁnd interesting variations of this scheme, however. As a
matter of fact, we remark that in some cases also small clusters survive, which lie on
the sites of the dual lattice. In particular, when a small cluster lies exactly on the
center, it is likely to act as intermediate of the four large clusters which lie closest
to it, so that in the long run they fuse in a large central cluster, which explicitly
breaks the lattice symmetry of the conﬁguration (as for ǫ = 0.10, for instance).
Such an anomalous feature can be viewed as an example of partial consensus below
the critical treshold.

We have compared the ﬁnal conﬁguration of each opinion component with that
of the one-dimensional dynamics corresponding to the same value of ǫ, for several
values of ǫ. Most comparisons we have performed show a good similarity, with just
a few exceptions, which means that the single opinion components - for a squared
opinion range - evolve almost independently of each other. The bidimensional dy-
namics is then, in most cases, eﬀectively one-dimensional.

range. From top left to bottom right: ǫ=0.04,0.07,0.08; 0.09, 0.095,0.10; 0.12, 0.20,0.22.

4.2. Circular conﬁdence range

Let us now examine the situation when the conﬁdence range is a circle of radius
ǫ. In this case the two components x, y are necessarily correlated, thus we would
expect appreciable changes, both in the values of the thresholds for cluster merging
and in the symmetry of the ﬁnal opinion conﬁgurations.

Fig. 7. As Fig. 5 (ǫ=0.15) but for circular conﬁdence range and t=2,3,4,6.

In Fig. 7 we take four pictures of the dynamics of the system for ǫ = 0.15. The
pattern looks very much the same as in the corresponding Fig. 5. The number of
clusters, their ordering in opinion space and the ratio of the cluster masses are the
same. Other trials for diﬀerent values of the conﬁdence bound show that this is not
a coincidence: the circular conﬁdence range does not change much the situation. In
particular, the consensus threshold is only slightly higher than in the previous case,
about 0.23. There are two reasons for that:

• the surface of the circle is close to that of the square with the same linear
dimension (the ratio is π/4 ∼ 0.8), so that the sets of compatible agents in
the two cases considerably overlap;

• the dynamics always starts from the edges of the opinion space, where the
opinion distribution is necessarily inhomogeneous, so that it is essentially the
shape of the opinion space which rules the symmetry of the resulting opinion
landscape.

To have an overview of the situation, we report a series of contour plots relative
to the ﬁnal stage of the evolution at various ǫ, like in Fig. 6. The resulting Fig.
8 conﬁrms that the clusters indeed sit on the sites of a square lattice, as we have
seen above. There are also important diﬀerences, however. Particularly striking is
the occasional existence of groups of four clusters near the center, which lie closer
to each other as compared to the other clusters (see, for instance, the patterns
corresponding to ǫ = 0.08 and ǫ = 0.12). Moreover, as we have seen for the case of
the squared conﬁdence range, sometimes smaller clusters survive on (some) sites of
the dual lattice, especially at the center of the opinion space (like for ǫ = 0.10 and
ǫ = 0.20).

It is also interesting to show the cluster formation in the case in which a group of
four clusters near the center appears and remains stable in time. In Fig.9 a sequence
of six contour plots calculated at diﬀerent times is shown for ǫ = 0.08. As one can
see, the ﬁrst snapshot conﬁrms the previous statement that the symmetry of the
opinion conﬁgurations is ﬁxed by the shape of the opinion space. Going on, one
can observe the progressive merging of the pairs of clusters with reciprocal distance
less than the conﬁdence bound radius. Finally, in the last picture, the survival
of the four ”anomalous” central clusters indicates that these clusters lie exactly
at the border of the conﬁdence range and this is clearly an eﬀect of the circular
shape of the conﬁdence range (with a squared range, these four clusters would be
attracted towards the center). We could also interprete it as a typical eﬀect of the
interdependence between the two components of the opinion vector.

5. Conclusions

We have extended the continuum opinion dynamics of Krause-Hegselmann to
the case in which the opinion is not just a scalar but a vector with real-valued com-
ponents. The extension is straightforward, with some freedom in the choice of the
shape of the conﬁdence range and the opinion space. Here we took a square for the
opinion space and a square and a circle for the conﬁdence range. We investigated
a community where everybody talks to everybody else, and analyzed the dynamics
and the ﬁnal opinion conﬁgurations by solving numerically a rate equation. We
found that if we project the ﬁnal opinion conﬁgurations on any component, the
number of clusters is essentially the same as in the one-dimensional opinion dy-
namics. The consensus threshold is slightly larger for the circular conﬁdence range
because the area spanned by the circle is smaller than that spanned by the square
with the same linear dimension, but the two values are close to each other and to
the one-dimensional consensus threshold. The structure formed by the centers of
the ﬁnal opinion clusters is a regular square lattice, but for special values of the
conﬁdence bound peculiar patterns also occur: survival of small clusters on the sites
of the dual lattice, merging of the innermost four clusters into a large central one,
existence of a compact group of four clusters near the center.

Summing up, we have found that vector opinion dynamics induces no signiﬁca-
tive variation in the evolution of the system that cannot be deduced by combining
the results of the simple one-dimensional dynamics of the single opinion components.
We studied here just the case of bidimensional opinions, but we do not expect big
changes for a higher number of opinion components. However, we should not forget
that we investigated a particularly simple model on a complete graph starting from
a uniform opinion distribution, and this is at best only a zeroth-order approximation
of what happens for real systems.

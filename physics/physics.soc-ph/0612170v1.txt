Abstract

Volatility dynamics of wavelet - ﬁltered stock price time series is studied.
Using the universal thresholding method of wavelet ﬁltering and a principle
of minimal linear autocorrelation of noise component we ﬁnd that the quan-
titative characteristics of volatility dynamics of denoised series are noticeably
diﬀerent from those of the raw data and the noise.

1 Introduction

Distinguishing valuable information from noise is one of the major problem
one faces in developing a quantitative picture of price dynamics. Generically
one divides market participants into those making rational choices based on
some adopted strategy and those making eﬀectively random decisions (noise
traders). Understanding the impact of rational strategies requires therefore
ﬁltering of observed price series with respect to the noise contribution. The
main diﬃculty in separating meaningful signal from noise lies in the im-
possibility of giving a rigorous deﬁnition of what noise is. Usual intuition
visualizes noise as a high frequency uncorrelated dressing on top of a some-
what slower evolving signal containing useful information. The problem of
making this picture quantitative is twofold. First, noise can exist not just on
some single scale, but on multiple scales. In this case one should denoise the
raw signal at several potentially relevant scales. Second, having noise with
vanishing linear autocorrelation does not imply that its higher order nonlin-
ear autocorrelations are zero. A useful instrument for performing multiscale
denoising is a wavelet - based ﬁltering, see e.g. [1, 2, 3]. As to the existence of
high order nonlinear correlations in the noise component, this will be a part
of discussing volatility dynamics in the present paper. Let us also mention
that recently wavelet - based denoising of ﬁnancial time series was discussed
in [9, 10], where a separation in the characteristics of active (turbulent) and
inactive (laminar) periods in the ﬁltered signal was studied.

In the present paper we shall concentrate on studying volatity dynamics
of wavelet-ﬁltered ﬁnancial series. Volatility (magnitude of price increments)
is one of the key characteristics of ﬁnancial time series.
In contrast with
the classical diﬀusion (Brownian random walk) where volatility is constant,
ﬁnancial time series are characterized by an intermittent pattern of high
and low volatility periods. Such behavior points to a presence of long-range
memory of the magnitude of price increments (volatility), see e.g. [4, 5]. In
particular, long memory property of volatility dynamics shows itself in a very
slow power-like decay of volatility autocorrelation3. Proper account for the
impact of varying time horizons on volatility dynamics allows to construct
a parsimonious model of stock price evolution allowing to describe many
important properties of observed stock price evolution [6, 8].

In the present paper we focus on studying the autocorrelation properties
of high-frequency volatility. We analyze the data for 5-minute returns of the
index MICEX10INDEX and ﬁve most liquid stocks EESR, RTKM, LKOH,

3Detailed studies of volatility correlations have revealed several characteristic time

scales staying behind apparent long-range memory of volatity dynamics [6, 7].

2 Volatility dynamics of wavelet - ﬁltered price

series

It is well - known that dynamical properties of stock price series are very
close to those of the random walk. This refers in particular to a nearly absent
autocorrelation of stock price incremements. A more detailed analysis shows
however, that zero autocorrelation does not mean that the consequent price
increments are independent. This dependence shows itself through more
complex nonlinear correlators, e.g. those of lagged absolute values of price
increments.

For all the instruments under consideration we shall study a series of
normalized 5 - minute logarithmic returns with zero mean and unit standard
deviation:

r0
n = log

p(tn + ∆T )
p(tn)

 

!

=> rn =

r0
n − hrni
σ

Filtering of the original series {r} corresponds to its separation into ﬁl-

tered and noise components:

(1)

(2)

r = rF + rN

As mentioned in the Introduction, denosing ﬁnancial time series is a cru-
cial step in unraveling the probabilistic dependence patterns hidden in it.
The main problem is that a rigorous deﬁnition of noise based on some fun-
damental principles of theoretical ﬁnance does not exist. Therefore when
considering a problem of ﬁltering noise from a series an operational deﬁnition
of noise should be formulated. In ﬁnancial applications the most important
characteristic of noise is, ideally, an absence of any type of predictability cor-
responding to complete probabilistic independence of the terms in the series
under consideration. In practice it is practically impossible to have a denois-
ing procedure ensuring that all nonlinear autocorrelation functions are zero.
We shall therefore restrict our consideration to the usual linear autocorrela-
tion function with lag 1 and require that the lagged autocorrelation of noise
component of price increments ρN (1) vanishes:

ρN (1) ≡ hrN (t) rN (t + ∆T )i = 0

(3)

The property (3) ensures that the noise component does not contain linear
that a conditional mean hrN (t + ∆T )irN (t) = ρN · r(t)
predictability, i.e.

3

vanishes for any rN (t) so that noise does not contain trivial proﬁtable oppor-
tunities.

The ﬁltering procedure we employ is based on the universal threshold

wavelet ﬁltering [11, 12]. It is realized in three stages:

• Wavelet transformation of the original time series of price returns r(t)

with discrete wavelet transformation (DWT):

r(t) =⇒ wj,n = 2−j/2

dt r(t) ψ(2−jt − n)

(4)

Z
where ψ(t) is a mother wavelet function which we will choose as that
of the Daubechy 2 wavelet.

• Separating the set of wavelet coeﬃcients wj,n into the noise wN

j,n and
signal wF
j,n contributions through universal thresholding procedure [11,
12] where the signal components satisfy, at each resolution level j, the
requirement

| wF

j,n| >

2 log n σj,n ,

q

(5)

n is a number of wavelet coeﬃcients at level j and σj,n is their standard
deviation.

• Inverse wavelet transformation of the set {wF

j,n} producing the ﬁltered
time series of returns rF (t) and, by default, a noise component rN (t) ≡
r(t) − rF (t).

As described above, to completely specify the optimal ﬁltering procedure we
need to give an operational deﬁnition of noise. Below we shall deﬁne opti-
mal ﬁltering as that leading to the smallest 1-lag autocorrelation coeﬃcient
of noise component within the adopted ﬁltering procedure. A natural pa-
rameter within the universal thresholding scheme one can tune is a number
of levels involved in thresholding process. The considered time series con-
sist of 16384 = 214 5-minute intervals, so one has 14 levels of resolution.
A customary choice is applying thresholding to all levels starting from the
third. We have considered a starting level as a tunable parameter allowing to
leading to smallest one-lag autocorrelation coeﬃcient
achieve optimal (i.e.
of the noise component) ﬁltering. An analysis showed that for the index
MICEX10INDEX it was optimeal to start with the 7-th level, whereas for all
ﬁve stocks the optimal starting level is the 3-d. An illustration of the eﬀect
of ﬁltering is given in Fig. 1 in which the raw cumulative normalized returns
and their wavelet-ﬁltered counterparts for the index MIXEX10INDEX and
In Fig. 1 we clearly see a diﬀerence that a
the stock LKOH are plotted.

choice of the starting level makes: ﬁltering of the index series starts from a
much ﬁner resolution than that of a stock.

Let us now compare some properties of the raw and ﬁltered time series

r(t) and rF (t). Two most interesting questions are:

• Does ﬁltering induce linear autocorrelation in the ﬁltered time series?

• Is the ﬁltered time series more/less non-gaussian than the original one?

• What are the correlation patterns characterizing the ﬁltered series as

compared to those of noise and original noisy series?

The answer is the ﬁrst question is given by the lagged autocorrelation func-
tion ρ(l). To answer the second one one has to introduce a quantitative
measure of the distance between the distributions of returns P(r) and P(rF )
and their gaussian distributions having the same standard deviation. A con-
venient quantitative measure of this distance is the (normalized) hypercum-
ulant [4]:

κ =

π
2
For the gaussian distribution κ = 1, whereas κ < 1 means that the corre-
sponding distribution is leptokurtic (i.e. having positive anomalous kurtosis
and heavy tails). The corresponding characteristics for all instruments under
consideration are shown in Table1:

We see that the autocorrelations of the original series are somewhat am-
pliﬁed in the ﬁltered ones but remain at the insigniﬁcant levels (except for
SNGS and SBER). A much more pronounced eﬀect is seen in the drastic
diﬀerence between the values of normalized hypercumulant κ in hte raw abd
ﬁltered series. We see that the ﬁltered series are much more non-gaussian
than the raw ones.

5

To address the third question let us now turn to the analysis of the volatil-
ity dynamics of raw, wavelet-transformed and noise time series. We will use
a simple deﬁnition of volatility as an absolute value of price returns. A fun-
damental characteristics of volatility dynamics by is a lagged autocorrelation
function

g(k) =

h(| rn| − h| r|i)(| rn+k| − h| r|i)i
σ2(| r|)

One of the most important properties of ﬁnancial time series is a slow power-
like decay of g(k) with k showing that a stochastic process governing temporal
evolution of volatility is a long-range memory one, see e.g. [4].

The volatility autocorrelation functions of the raw, ﬁltered and noise se-
ries for the index MICEX10INDEX and the corresponding averaged volatility
autocorrelations of ﬁve stocks under consideration are shown in Fig. 2. All
of them indeed demonstrate a clear powerlike behavor

The slopes {α} of the powerlike ﬁts to the curves shown in Fig. 2 are given
in Table 2:

-0.68

A striking feature of the plots in Fig. 2 and, correspondingly, the values in
Table 2 is that the while autocorrelation properties of the raw and noise series
are practically the same, the ﬁltered series has approximately a two times
larger amplitude g0 and a steeper decay with α = 0.67 for stocks and α = 0.52
for the index compared to the slope of α = 0.19 for both of the original time
series. This shows that wavelet denoising reveals volatility dynamics very
diﬀerent from that seen in the noisy orignal series4. This property can be
very important in terms of examining real degree of predictability in volatility
dynamics which is of great interest in many practical applications. This fact
constitutes a main result of the present paper

4Let us mention that the sensitivity of calibrating volatility dynamics to noise eﬀects

is very large, see e.g. the comment in [8].

3 Conclusions and outlook

Let us formulate once again the main conclusions of the present study. We
used a procedure of ﬁltering the original price return series by the universal
thresholding of the coeﬃcients of its discrete wavelet transform. We found
that

• The ﬁltered series is much more non-gaussian as the original one.

• The ﬁltered series is characterized by a drastically diﬀerent volatility
autocorrelation function with larger amplitude and slope than in the
original series.

• The volatility autocorrelation function of noise is very close to that of

the initial series.

In the present paper we considered only one particular characteristics of
the wavelet - ﬁltered - its volatility autocorrelation functions. Recent studies
have revealed a number of striking dependence patterns characterizing high
frequency dynamics of stock prices [13, 14, 15, 16]. It will be very interesting
to see how these dependence patterns change when one considers the denoised
price series. Work on these issues is currently in progress.

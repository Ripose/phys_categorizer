With the advent of digital media, people are increasingly resorting to online channels for com-
mercial transactions. Online auction is a prototypical example. In such online transactions, the
pattern of bidding activity is more complex than traditional oﬄine transactions; this is because
the number of bidders participating in a given transaction is not bounded and the bidders can also
easily respond to the bidding instantaneously. By using the recently developed network theory, we
study the interaction patterns between bidders (items) who (that) are connected when they bid
for the same item (if the item is bid by the same bidder). The resulting network is analyzed by
using the hierarchical clustering algorithm, which is used for clustering analysis for expression data
from DNA microarrays. A dendrogram is constructed for the item subcategories; this dendrogram
is compared with a traditional classiﬁcation scheme. The implication of the diﬀerence between the
two is discussed.

INTRODUCTION

Electronic commerce (e-commerce) refers to any type
of business of commercial transaction that involves in-
formation transfer across the Internet. Online auc-
tion, a synergetic combination of the Internet supported
by instantaneous interactions and traditional auction
mechanisms, has rapidly expanded over the last decade.
Owing to this rapid expansion and the importance of
online auctions, very recently researchers have begun
to pay attention to the various aspects of online auc-
tions [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. According to recent studies
based on empirical data obtained from eBay.com, it was
discovered that the online auction system is driven by
a self-organized process, involving almost all the agents
that participate in a given auction activity. For exam-
ple, the total number of bids placed for a single item or
category and the bid frequency submitted by each agent
follow power-law distributions [5]. Further, the bidding
process occurring in online auctions has been successfully
described through the stochastic rate equation [6]. Thus,
understanding of the bidding activities in online auctions
is a highly attractive topic for the statistical physics com-
munity.

The remarkable connection between beer and diapers
discovered in 1992 by Blischok et al. [8] has signiﬁcantly
improved proﬁts. They analyzed the correlation between
items sold at a drug store during a particular time in-
terval between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m.. They found a strong
correlation between the two items, which had never been
noticed by the retailer earlier. This correlation arises
from the fact that fathers in families tend to buy beer
when they are told by their wives to buy diapers while
returning home. This discovery, which is considered as
a pioneering work of data mining, compelled drug stores
to redesign their displays; this resulted in an increase in
beer sales.

In online auctions, most of the limitations hamper-
ing traditional oﬄine auctions, such as spatial and tem-
poral constraint have virtually disappeared. Thus,
it
would be interesting to investigate how the bidding pat-
tern of online auctions has changed from the tradi-
tional one. On the other hand, recently, considerable
attention have been focused on complex network prob-
lems as an interdisciplinary subject [9, 10, 11]. Diverse
computational methods to ﬁnd clusters within large-
scale networks have been introduced (for example, see
Refs. [12, 13, 14, 15, 16]). Thus, by combining these two
issues, in this study, we investigate the pattern emerg-
ing from the interactions between individual bidders or
items in online auctions by using the recently developed
network theory. The resulting network provides informa-
tion on the bidding pattern of individual bidders as well
as the correlation between diﬀerent item subcategories.
Moreover, we construct a dendrogram for these subcat-
egories and compare it with a traditional classiﬁcation
scheme based on oﬀ-line transactions. For the purpose,
we use an algorithm applied for clustering analysis for
the expression data from a DNA microarray experiment
in biological systems [17]. The dendrogram thus obtained
is consumer-oriented, reﬂecting the pattern of an individ-
ual bidder’s activities. Thus, it can be used for increasing
proﬁts by providing consumers with a link between the
items, which should interest the consumers.

Our study is based on empirical data [5] collected from
http://www.eBay.com. The dataset comprises all the
auctions that ended in a single day, July 5, 2001, and in-
cludes 264,073 auctioned items grouped into 18 categories
and 192 subcategories. The number of distinct agents
that participated in these merchandize was 384,058.

II. TOPOLOGIES OF BIDDER AND ITEM
NETWORKS

The data contain the information on which bidder bids
for which item via their unique user ID. Thus, we can con-
struct a bipartite network comprising two disjoint sets of
vertices, bidders and items, as shown in Fig. 1. The
bipartite network can be converted to a single species of
network such as the bidder or the item network, as shown
in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b), respectively. The bidder and item
networks can have edges with weight. For example, bid-
ders C and D in Fig. 1 are connected twice through items
a and c. Hence, the edge between C and D has weight 2.
Similarly, items a and b are connected twice through bid-
ders C and E. Thus, the edge between vertices a and b in
the item network has weight 2. Statistics describing the
topology of the entire network and the giant component
of the bidder and the item network are listed in Table I
and Table II, respectively.

Next, we characterize the structure of the bidder and
item networks. First, we regard each network as a binary
network, neglecting the weight of each edge. The network
conﬁguration can be described by the adjacent matrix
{aij}; its component is 1 when two vertices i and j are
connected and 0 otherwise. Then, degree ki of vertex i
N
j aij, which is the number of edges connected
is ki =
to it. We ﬁnd that the degree distribution exhibits a
power-law behavior asymptotically for both the bidder
and item networks, Pd(k) ∼ k−γ. The degree exponent

γ is estimated to be γB ≈ 3.0 for the bidder network and
γI ≈ 2.0 for the item network, as shown in Fig. 3.

Second, strength si of vertex i is the sum of the weights
N
of each edge connected to it. That is, si =
j aijwij ,
where wij is the weight of the edge between vertices i and
j. The strength distributions of the bidder and item net-
works also exhibit power-law behaviors asymptotically as
Ps(s) ∼ (s + s0)−η where ηB ≈ 4.0 for the bidder net-
work and ηI ≈ 3.5 for the item network, as shown in
Fig. 4. s0 is constant. Strength and degree of a given
vertex exhibit an almost linear relationship s(k) ∼ kζ
with ζ ≈ 0.95; however, large ﬂuctuations are observed
for large k in Fig. 5.

Third, we measure the mean nearest-neighbor degree
function hknni(k). The mean degree of the nearest-
neighbor vertices of a given vertex i with degree k is
measured as follows:

ki,nn = (

aijkj )/ki.

the item network (b). Solid line, obtained from a least-square-
ﬁt, has a slope of 0.44 for the bidder network (a) and 0.77 for
the item network (b). Both the networks are assortatively
mixed.

k is taken to obtain hknni(k). For the weighted network,
formula (1) is replaced following the formula [18]:

k(w)
i,nn =

(2)

From this equation, hk(w)
nn i(k) can be similarly obtained.
It is found that the functions hknni(k) and hk(w)
nn i(k) in-
crease with the degree k of the centered vertex for both
the bidder and item networks irrespective of the binary
or weighted versions. That is, both the networks are as-
sortatively mixed, implying that active bidders tend to
simultaneously bid for common items, thereby attractive
items are also connected via such active bidders.

Fourth, the local clustering coeﬃcient ci is the density
of transitive relationships, and is deﬁned as the number
of triangles formed by its neighbors, which are cornered
at vertex i, divided by the maximum possible number of
neighbors, ki(ki − 1)/2. That is,

ci =

ki(ki − 1) X

The average of ci over the vertices with degree k is called
the clustering coeﬃcient function c(k). For weighted net-
works, a similar clustering coeﬃcient c(w)
is deﬁned [18]
as

The average of c(w)
over the cornered vertices with degree
k is similarly deﬁned and denoted as c(w)(k). For the bid-
der network, the clustering coeﬃcient functions c(k) and
c(w)(k) decrease with respect to k as shown in Fig.7(a);
they exhibit large ﬂuctuations for large k, implying that
the bidder network is hierarchically organized. For the
item network, however, both c(k) and c(w)(k) are almost

network is almost random.

independent of k, which is shown in Fig. 7(b); this implies
that the network is almost randomly organized. Such be-
haviors are observed irrespective of whether the networks
are binary or weighted.

III. CLUSTER IDENTIFICATION

By using network analysis, individual elements can be
classiﬁed into clusters. Here, we apply the hierarchical
agglomeration (HA) algorithm, which was introduced by
Clauset et al. [19], to the item network containing 264,073
items. In particular, the algorithm is useful for a system
containing a large number of elements. Clusters iden-
tiﬁed using this analysis are compared with traditional
subcategories established based on oﬀ-line transactions.
The obtained diﬀerence can be used for reorganizing a
dendrogram with regard to item subcategories; this dif-
ference reﬂects the pattern of online bidding activities.

To realize this, we ﬁrst store the topology of the item
network by using the adjacent matrix {aij}. By main-
taining this information, we delete all the edges, thereby
leaving N isolated vertices. At each step, we select one
edge from the stored adjacent matrix, which maximizes
a change in the modularity, deﬁned as

Q =

eαα − a2
α,

X
α

(5)

where eαα is the fraction of the edges that connect the
vertices within cluster α on both the ends of each edge,
and aα is the fraction of edges attached on one end or
both the ends to vertices within cluster α. The selected
edge is eliminated from the stored matrix. We continue
this edge-adding process until the modularity becomes
maximum. We ﬁnd that the modularity reaches the value
Qmax ≈ 0.79 for the item network and Qmax ≈ 0.83 for
the bidder network; this implies that both the networks
are extremely well categorized. We recognize 1,904 and
870 distinct clusters in the bidder and item networks, re-
spectively. The cluster sizes, the number of vertices of

roughly. The exponents are estimated from the data in
the region with small M .

IV. DENDROGRAM BASED ON ONLINE
TRANSACTIONS

A. Closeness

In this section, we focus on the item network. We have
identiﬁed 870 distinct clusters by using the clustering al-
gorithm. Among them, 49 clusters contain more than 100
items within each cluster. On the other hand, according
to the traditional classiﬁcation scheme, items in the eBay

auction are categorized into 18 categories which contains
192 subcategories. Obviously the clusters that we found
are not equivalent to these categories or subcategories.
Thus, our goal is to construct a new dendrogram, a hi-
erarchical tree, among 192 subcategories based on the
closeness between the obtained clusters and the existing
subcategories.

To illustrate closeness, we select a cluster α and clas-
sify the items within the cluster into 192 subcategories.
The fraction of items in each subcategory µ is the close-
ness Cαµ. For example, Fig. 10 shows the closenesses for
the ﬁrst ﬁve largest clusters. Each strip represents a clus-
ter obtained from the HA algorithm. For each strip, the
x-axis represents 192 subcategories, and the y-axis does
the closeness. The bar indicates the closeness. For clus-
ter 1, subcategory (a) exhibits the largest closeness. For
cluster 2. subcategory (c) has the largest closeness, and
so on. The abbreviations for the 18 main categories are
as follows: Antique stands for antiques and art; Biz, busi-
ness and oﬃce; Clothes, clothing and accessories; Collect,
collectibles; Comp, computers; Elec, consumer electron-
ics; Dolls, dolls and bears; Home, home and garden’s;
Jewelry, jewelry, gemstones and watches; Glass, pottery
and glass; and Estt, real estate.

B. Correlation matrix

To quantify the correlation, we adopt the method used
for the clustering analysis for expression data from DNA
microarrays. In this approach, we regard the closeness as
the expression level, subcategories as genes, and clusters
as diﬀerent DNA microarray experiments [17].

The correlation matrix element ραβ is deﬁned as

ραβ =

hCαµCβµi − hCαµihCβµi

hC2

αµi − hCαµi2

hC2

βµi − hCβµi2

(cid:1)(cid:0)

q(cid:0)

(6)

,

(cid:1)

where Cαµ represents the closeness of subcategory µ (µ =
1, . . . n = 192) to cluster α (α = 1, . . . 870) and h· · · i
denotes the average over diﬀerent clusters indexed by µ.
Based on the correlation matrix, a dendrogram that
assembles all n = 194 subcategories into a single tree
can be constructed.
For this purpose, we use the
hierarchical clustering algorithm introduced by Eisen
et al.
[17]. We start the tree construction process by
calculating the correlation coeﬃcients {ραβ} with size
192 × 870. Next, the matrix is scanned to identify a pair
of subcategories with the highest value of the correlation
coeﬃcient, and the two subcategories are combined.
Thus, a pseudo-subcategory is created, and its closeness
proﬁle is calculated only by averaging closenesses of
the combined subcategories. This is referred to as the
average-linkage clustering method. Then, n − 2 isolated
subcategories and a pseudo-subcategory remain. The
correlation matrix is updated with these n − 1 units and
the highest correlation coeﬃcient is found. The process
is repeated n − 1 times until only a single element

remains. After these steps, a dendrogram is constructed
in which the height represents the magnitude of the
correlation coeﬃcient.

5

C. Rearrangement of subcategories in the
dendrogram

The resulting dendrogram is shown in the upper part
of Fig. 11, which is considerably diﬀerent from the tra-
ditional classiﬁcation scheme shown in the lower part of
this ﬁgure. We discuss the details of the correlations of
the subcategories in the dendrogram. For discussion, we
divide the entire tree structure into six branches, denoted
by (A)–(F).

To be speciﬁc, branch (A) covers a broad range of dif-
ferent collectibles. The relationship between the subcat-
egories may be attributed to collecting manias. Branch
(B) mainly covers three types of subcategories: cloth-
ing and accessories, business, oﬃce and industries, and
sports categories. Branch (C) consists of three parts: the
ﬁrst part has antiquary property and the items used for
decorating homes and the second part covers very broad
kinds of items. The third is interesting and covers a set
of electronic products such as computers, cameras, audio
players, etc. It also includes video games as well as food
and beverages. At a glance, one may wonder how these
two items are correlated; however, by considering the fact
that some video games maniacs requires foods and bev-
erages while playing, one can ﬁnd the reason. Thus, the
dendrogram indeed reﬂects the bidding patterns of indi-
vidual bidders. Branch (D) covers items related to artis-
tic collections and hobbies. Branch (E) covers books, dolls
for children, etc. Finally, branch (F) mainly covers col-
lectibles in a wide range from jewelry to stamps.

V. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION

Based on the empirical data collected from the eBay
web site, we have constructed a bipartite network
comprising bidders and items. The bipartite network is
converted into two single species of networks, the bidder
and item networks. We measured various topological
properties of each network. Both networks are scale free
in the degree distribution.
It is noteworthy that both
the networks are assortatively mixed with regard to the
degree correlation. This fact implies that the active
bidders tend to simultaneously bid for common items;
therefore, they are connected. Accordingly, attractive
items are connected via such active bidders. Next, by
applying the hierarchical agglomeration algorithm, we
identiﬁed clusters in the bidder and item networks. The
clusters are well separated from each other. Then, we
calculate the correlation matrix between subcategories
by using the information on the fraction of items in each
subcategory in a given cluster. By using this correlation

FIG. 10: The closeness between the clusters and subcategories. The x-axis represents the 192 subcategories and the y-axis
represents the closeness. For the largest cluster (cluster 1), subcategory (a), Sports and Goods, exhibits the largest closeness.
This result indicates that the main fraction of items in cluster 1 originates from subcategory (a), even though small fractions
of items exist from other subcategories. For cluster 2, the subcategories of Clothing & Accessories (b), Women Clothing (c),
and Movies (d) are the major fractions. The fact that these three subcategories belong to the same cluster implies that they
are strongly correlated in an online transaction. For cluster 3, the subcategory of Sports Trading Cards (e) is dominant. For
cluster 4, (f),(g),(h), and (i) subcategories exhibit a strongly correlation. For cluster 5, subcategories (j),(k),(l), and (m) are
correlated, which represent the Pop Culture of Collectibles, Computers, Consumer Electronics, and Movies, respectively.

matrix, we construct the dendrogram, which is diﬀerent
from the traditional classiﬁcation scheme. Based on a
detailed investigation about the items closely located in
the dendrogram, we ﬁnd that the dendrogram indeed
is bidder-oriented in an online auction. Therefore, the
dendrogram could be useful for marketing renovation,

resulting in an increase in proﬁts.

Sub-categories

FIG. 11: Upper part: the dendrogram constructed by using the hierarchical clustering algorithm for the item network of an eBay
online auction. Subcategories in branches (A)–(F) are explained in the text. Middle part: the closenesses of each subcategory
for diﬀerent clusters are shown with various concentrations. Lower part: the traditional classiﬁcation scheme of subcategories
in the version where original data were collected. The classiﬁcation scheme is a bilayer structure comprising 18 categories and
192 subcategories. For visual clarity, however, the bilayer structure is shown in a multilayer manner. For comparison, the
subcategories are in the same order as that used in the upper part. We can easily observe that the traditional classiﬁcation
scheme is entangled from the bidder-oriented perspective.

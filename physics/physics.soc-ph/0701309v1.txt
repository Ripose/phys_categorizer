In this paper, we study traﬃc dynamics in scale-free networks in which packets are generated
with non-homogeneously selected sources and destinations, and forwarded based on the local routing
strategy. We consider two situations of packet generation: (i) packets are more likely generated at
high-degree nodes; (ii) packets are more likely generated at low-degree nodes. Similarly, we consider
two situations of packet destination: (a) packets are more likely to go to high-degree nodes; (b)
packets are more likely to go to low-degree nodes. Our simulations show that the network capacity
and the optimal value of α corresponding to the maximum network capacity greatly depend on the
conﬁguration of packets’ sources and destinations. In particular, the capacity is greatly enhanced
when most packets travel from low-degree nodes to high-degree nodes.

INTRODUCTION

Complex networks can describe a wide range of sys-
tems in nature and society, therefore there has been a
quickly growing interest in this area [1-3]. Since the
surprising small-world phenomenon discovered by Watts
and Strogatz [4] and scale-free phenomenon with degree
distribution following P (k) ∼ k−γ by Barab´asi and Al-
bert[5], the evolution mechanism of the structure and
the dynamics on the networks have recently received a
lot of interests among physics community. Due to the
importance of large communication networks such as the
Internet and WWW with scale-free properties in mod-
ern society, processes of dynamics taking place upon the
underlying structure such as traﬃc congestion of infor-
mation ﬂow have drawn more and more attention from
physical and engineering ﬁelds.

The ultimate goal of studying these large communica-
tion networks is to control the increasing traﬃc conges-
tion and improve the eﬃciency of information transporta-
tion. Many recent studies have focused on the eﬃciency
improvement of communication networks which is usu-
ally considered from two aspects: modifying underlying
network structures or developing better routing strate-
gies. In view of the high cost of changing the underlying
structure, the latter is comparatively preferable.

Recent works proposed some models to mimic the traf-
ﬁc routing on complex networks by introducing packets
generating rate as well as homogeneously selected sources
and destinations of each packet [6-12]. These kinds of
models also deﬁne the capacity of networks measured by
a critical generating rate. At this critical rate, a contin-
uous phase transition from free ﬂow state to congested
state occurs. In the free state, the numbers of created
and delivered packets are balanced, leading to a steady
state. While in the jammed state, the number of accu-
mulated packets increases with time due to the limited

delivering capacity or ﬁnite queue length of each node.
In these models, packets are forwarded following the ran-
dom walking [6], the shortest path [7], the eﬃcient path
[8], the next-nearest-neighbor search strategy [9], the lo-
cal information [10] or the integration of local static and
dynamic information [11,12].

Nevertheless, in previous studies, packets are gener-
ated with homogeneously selected sources and destina-
tions, i.e., sources and destinations are randomly cho-
sen without preference. However, in the real networked
traﬃc, packets are more likely to be generated at some
nodes than at others and are more likely to go to some
nodes than to others. Therefore, in this paper, we study
traﬃc dynamics with considering packets are generated
with non-homogeneously selected sources and destina-
tions, and delivered based on the local routing strategy,
which is favored in cases where there is a heavy commu-
nication cost to searching the network.
The paper is organized as follows.

In section 2, the
traﬃc model is introduced. In section 3, the simulations
results are presented and discussed. The conclusion is
given in section 4.

II. MODEL AND RULES

Barab´asi-Albert model

is the simplest and a well
known model which can generate networks with power-
law degree distribution P (k) ∼ k−γ, where γ = 3. With-
out losing generality, we construct the network structure
by following the same method used in Ref. [5]: Starting
from m0 fully connected nodes, a new node with m0 edges
is added to the existing graph at each time step accord-
ing to preferential attachment, i.e., the probability Qi of
being connected to the existing node i is proportional to
the degree ki.

Then we model the traﬃc of packets on the given

i

graph. At each time step, there are R packets gener-
ated in the system. Each packet is generated at node i
with probability kβ1
P kβ1 , where ki is the degree of node
i and the sum runs over all nodes. Furthermore, the
kβ2
j
packet goes to the node j with probability
P kβ2 , where
the sum also runs over all nodes. Here β1 and β2 are two
parameters. In the special case of β1 = β2 = 0, the pack-
ets are generated with homogeneously selected sources
and destinations. When β1 > 0 (β1 < 0), packets are
more likely generated at high-degree (low-degree) nodes.
When β2 > 0 (β2 < 0), packets are more likely to go to
high-degree (low-degree) nodes.

We treat all the nodes as both hosts and routers and
assume that each node can deliver at most C packets
per time step towards their destinations. All the nodes
perform a parallel local search among their immediate
neighbors. If a packet’s destination is found within the
searched area of node l, i.e.
the immediate neighbors
of l, the packets will be delivered from l directly to its
target and then removed from the system. Otherwise,
the probability of a neighbor node i, to which the packet
will be delivered is as follows:

Pl→i =

kα
i
Pj kα
j

,

(1)

where the sum runs over the immediate neighbors of the
node l. α is an introduced tunable parameter. During the
evolution of the system, FIFO (ﬁrst- in ﬁrst-out) rule is
applied. All the simulations are performed with choosing
C = 10.

In order to characterize the network capacity, we use

the order parameter presented in Ref. [13]:

η(R) = lim
t→∞

< △Load >
R△t

,

(2)

where Load(t) is deﬁned as the number of packets within
the network at time t. △Load = Load(t + △t) − Load(t)
with < · · · > indicates average over time windows of
width △t. The order parameter represents the ratio be-
tween the outﬂow and the inﬂow of packets calculated
over long enough period. In the free ﬂow state, due to
the balance of created and removed packets, the load is
independent of time, which brings a steady state. Thus
when time tends to be unlimited, η is about zero. Other-
wise, when R exceeds a critical value Rc, the packets will
continuously pile up within the network, which destroys
the stead state. Thus, the quantities of packets within
the system will be a function of time, which makes η a
constant more than zero. Therefore, a sudden increment
of η from zero to nonzero characterizes the onset of the
phase transition from free ﬂow state to congestion, and
the network capacity can be measured by the maximal
generating rate Rc at the phase transition point.

III. RESULTS

2

In the special case of β1 = β2 = 0 (case 1), the maxi-
mum network capacity is Rc ≈ 40, which is reached at the
optimal value αc ≈ −1. This can be explained by not-
ing two facts that the degree-degree correlation is zero
in BA networks and the average number of packets on
nodes does not depend on degree k when αc ≈ −1 [10].
Next we investigate the case of β1 = −5.0 and β2 =
−5.0 (case 2), i.e., most packets travel from low-degree
nodes to low-degree nodes. Fig.1 compares the network
capacity Rc in cases 1 and 2. One can see that at a given
α, the network capacity decreases. This is easily to be
understood because a low-degree node has less links and
therefore more diﬃcult to be found by packets than a
high-degree node.

Furthermore, the optimal value αc is essentially the
same in cases 1 and 2, which is explained as follows. Let
ni denote the number of packets of node i at time t. Then
we have
dni
dt

= −ndeliver + nreceive + ngenerate

− nremove, (3)

where ndeliver, nreceive, ngenerate, and nremove denote
the number of packets delivered from node i to other
nodes, received from other nodes, generated at node i
and removed at node i. In case 1, ngenerate = nremove,
thus

dni
dt

= −ndeliver + nreceive.

(4)

From Eq.(4), Wang et al. show that n(k) ∼ k1+α [10].
Therefore, when α = −1, the average number of packets
on nodes is independent of degree k and the maximum
capacity is reached.

In case 2, we have ngenerate = nremove > 0 for low-
degree nodes and ngenerate = nremove ≈ 0 for high-
degree nodes. Thus, Eq.(4) is valid for both low-degree
nodes and high-degree nodes. Therefore, the optimal
value αc ≈ −1 does not change.

Fig.2 compares the network capacity Rc in case 1 and
in case 3 (where β1 = −2.0 and β2 = 2.0) and case 4
(where β1 = −5.0 and β2 = 5.0), i.e., most packets travel
from low-degree nodes to high-degree nodes. One can see
that the network capacity is greatly enhanced in cases 3
and 4. The maximum network capacity increases from
40 in case 1 to 119 in case 3 and to 720 in case 4. This
is because a high-degree node has much more links and
therefore much easier to be found by packets than a low-
degree node. Based on this result, we suggest that the
local routing strategy is very suitable if the packets are
more likely to go from low-degree nodes to high-degree
nodes.

Moreover, the optimal value of αc corresponding to
the maximum capacity increases from −1.0 in case 1 to
−0.9 in case 3 and to −0.8 in case 4. This is also ex-

and ngenerate
The packets generated in low-degree nodes and removed
in high-degree nodes enable the average number of pack-
ets on nodes to be independent of degree k. As a result,
the maximum capacity is achieved.

Fig.3 compares the network capacity Rc in case 1
and in case 5, where β1 = 5.0 and β2 = −5.0, i.e.,
most packets travel from high-degree nodes to low-degree
nodes. One can see that the network capacity becomes
smaller and the optimal value of αc decreases. The rea-
son of capacity decrease is the same as in case 2, i.e., a
low-degree node has less links and therefore more dif-
ﬁcult to be found by packets. The decrease of αc is

packets generated in high-degree nodes and removed in
low-degree nodes enable the average number of packets
on nodes to be independent of degree k. Consequently,
the maximum capacity is reached at αc < −1.

Fig.4 compares the network capacity Rc in case 1 and
in case 6 (where β1 = 3.0 and β2 = 3.0) and case 7
(where β1 = 5.0 and β2 = 5.0), i.e., most packets travel
from high-degree nodes to high-degree nodes. In case 6,
the network capacity is essentially independent of α for
α < −1 and decreases with the increase of α. In case 7,
the network capacity is essentially independent of α when
α is in the range studied. This is explained as follows.

In case 6, the probability that the highest-degree node
is chosen as origin is 0.33 and it is 0.6 in case 7. There-
fore, in case 6, when Rc > 31, the number of particles
generated in the highest-degree node exceeds the capac-
ity of the node. This leads to the congestion. As a result,
the constant network capacity for α < −1 occurs. Sim-
ilarly, in case 7, when Rc > 17, the number of particles
generated in the node exceeds the capacity of the node.
Therefore, the constant network capacity in the stud-
ied range emerges. To avoid the constant small network
capacity, it is necessary to enhance the capacity of the
nodes of high degrees.

IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

In this paper, we have investigated the network ca-
pacity in the scale-free networks, in which packets are
generated with non-homogeneously selected sources and
destinations, based on the local routing strategy.

Generally speaking, when most packets travel to low-
degree nodes, the network capacity will decrease. In con-
trast, when most packets travel to high-degree nodes,
whether the network capacity decreases or increases de-
pends on the selection of origins. When β2 is large, i.e.,
most packets are generated from high-degree nodes, the

routing strategy is very suitable if the packets are more
likely to go from low-degree nodes to high-degree nodes.
In addition, αc, i.e., the optimal value of α correspond-
ing to the maximum network capacity also depends on
the distribution of packets’ origins and destinations. We
have explained the reason why αc changes when the dis-
tribution of packets’ origins and destinations changes.

Finally, we would like to mention that our results may
be used to design a new local routing strategy, in which
the parameter α is packet-related. Concretely, α depends
on the origin and destination of the packet α = α(ko, kd),
where ko and kd denote the degree of the node where the
packet is generated and that of the node where the packet
goes to. A suitable choice of α(ko, kd) may enhance the
network capacity. Further investigations will be carried
out in future work.

highest-degree node is easily congested, which leads to
the congestion of the whole network. To avoid this, it is
necessary to enhance the capacity of high-degree nodes.
When most packets are generated from low-degree nodes,
the network is greatly enhanced. Therefore, the local

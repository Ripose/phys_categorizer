(Dated: working paper last revised: February 2, 2008)

We examine the out-of-equilibrium phase reported by Plerou et. al. in Nature, 421, 130 (2003)
using the data of the New York stock market (NYSE) between the years 2001 –2002. We ﬁnd that
the observed two phase phenomenon is an artifact of the deﬁnition of the control parameter coupled
with the nature of the probability distribution function of the share volume. We reproduce the two
phase behavior by a simple simulation demonstrating the absence of any collective phenomenon.
We further report some interesting statistical regularities of the demand ﬂuctuation of the ﬁnancial
market.

Recently a report based on New York stock exchange
(NYSE) data between period 1995-1996 ref. [1] reported
that the ﬁnancial market has two phases, namely, the
“equilibrium” phase, and the “out-of-equilibrium” phase.
Ref. [1] further reported a critical point which is the
boundary between a 0 and ﬁnite value of the order pa-
rameter for the observed phase transition.

In this paper we address the following questions in
an eﬀort to understand the observed two phase phe-
nomenon:

1. What is the cause of the observed two phase be-

havior ?

2. Do large

changes of price occur

in out-of-

equilibrium phase ?

Our study is based on the NYSE Trades and Quotes
(TAQ) database for the period 2001–2002 which records
every ask, bid, and transaction price.

Figure 1 gives an estimate of the percentage of transac-
tions during the period period 2001–2002 that was either
at the ask price (scaled to be 1), at the bid price (scaled
to be -1), or at an intermediate value between the ask
and the bid prices.

Using the method of ref. [1] we ﬁrst identify a buyer
initiated or a seller initiated transaction by a quantity a
which is deﬁned as follows:

1
0
−1

if
if
if

p > (ask − bid)/2
p = (ask − bid)/2
p < (ask − bid)/2

a = 




(1)

where p is a transaction price. Usually a transaction is
executed when a new quote hits the lowest ask price or
the highest bid price.

As in ref. [1], we deﬁne the volume imbalance Ω and

its standard deviation as

Ω(t) =

qiai

FIG. 1: Percentage of transactions occurring at ask, bid

that nearly 1/3 of the transactions take place in each one of
these three groups.

where qi is the share volume of the ith transaction within
the period ∆t.

Fig. 2 displays the probability density function (PDF)
P (Ω|Σ) of Ω for a given Σ. We observe a bi-modal
PDF with two extrema when Σ is larger than a critical
value. This feature of P (Ω|Σ) is reported as an instance
of two phase behavior in the ﬁnancial market [Fig. 1
(a)of ref. [1]].

We next accumulate the a between intervals t and t +

∆t to estimate a quantity Φ =

ai which measures

the number imbalance between buyer and seller initiated
trade within the time interval ∆t.

The ﬁrst moment σ of Φ is deﬁned as

N (t)

which measures the average volume of trade per transac-

We estimate Ω(t), Σ(t), and q(t) averaged over 102
stocks which has the largest total volume among all
NYSE stocks in 2002 with ∆t = 15 minutes. [4].

In phase transitions observed in physical systems, the
control parameters are independent variables. But in
ref. [1], the control parameter Σ is the magnitude of ﬂuc-
tuation of the order parameter Ω. When ﬂuctuations
are large, the underlying PDF of the random variable is
wide, leading us to think that we might replicate P (Ω|Σ)
by simulation.

First we evaluate the empirical correlations present in
the database between diﬀerent variables deﬁned in eq. 1–
5. Table I tabulates the estimated correlations.

Next, for simulation, we consider a, q, and N to be
identically and independently distributed (i.i.d) from two
possible PDFs given in Table II [2]. We execute the sim-
ulation for eight (23) possible combinations of the set a,
q and N .

Since a, q, and N are i.i.d, there are no autocorrela-
tions like that in the TAQ time series, but even then,
in we ﬁnd P (Ω|Σ) to have a bi-modal distribution only
when the PDF of the share volume is a power law (c.f.
Fig 3). This observation can be explained as follows:
First note that the PDF P (q) of q has the functional
form of a power law, i.e., P (q) ∼ q−1.5. Next note that
the Ω has a q in its deﬁnition, thus the PDF P (Ω) of Ω
also has the functional form of a power law. Occurrence
of extreme positive and negative events are much more
probable when P (Ω) has a fat tail. Since Σ by deﬁnition
is the standard deviation of the random variable Ω, large
values of Σ occur when extreme events (both positive
and negative) of Ω are sampled. Thus P (Ω|Σ) has two
extrema resulting from large positive and negative sam-
pling of the random variable Ω when we choose groups
with large Σ values [c.f. Fig. 3(a) and 3(c)].

Table III tabulates the estimated correlations between
the pairs q, Σ, and N , Σ for the case of TAQ database
and simulation. We ﬁnd correlation values for the TAQ
database and simulation to be statistically similar when
q and N are power law distributed, which further demon-
strates that the observed two phase eﬀect is not a sig-
nature of hidden collective phenomena within ﬁnancial
market. An explanation similar to the one above is re-
ported in ref. [3].

To examine this in closest detail, we next estimate the
PDF of q and N for a given Σ from the TAQ database.
Fig.4(a) show, that q is large for large Σ. Fig.4(b) shows
that N is almost independent of Σ. By this, we can infer
that the bi-modal PDF P (Ω|Σ) is caused by the trans-
actions of large investors with large number of shares.
The small decrease in < N > as Σ increases has a simple
explanation, which was pointed out by our referee.

FIG. 3: P (Ω|Σ) with Ω and Σ generated from i.i.d., for
four diﬀerent combinations of a, q, N . We observe a bi-
modal distribution of P (Ω|Σ) only when P (q) has a power
law functional form. Since P (q) ∼ q−1.5 and the deﬁnition of
Ω has q in its argument, P (Ω) also has the functional form
of a power law. Thus for the power law distributed P (Ω)
occurrence of extreme positive and negative events are much
more probable than if P (Ω) did not have a fat tail. Σ by
deﬁnition is the standard deviation of the random variable Ω.
Large values of Σ occurs when extreme events (both positive
and negative) are sampled. Thus P (Ω|Σ) has two extremas
resulting from a large positive and negative sampling of the
random variable Ω when groups with large Σ values are chosen
[c.f. (a) and (c)].

a fair and orderly market, crosses the book via his clerk
very regularly in an almost automated fashion. When
ﬂuctuations become large the specialist must take a close
look at the electronic order book and at the order from
the ﬂoor before he may decide which and at what price
it is fair to cross the orders. This manual intervention
takes time and is a plausible cause of the decrease in the
number of trades.

We observe that even though |R| is not correlated to
Σ or q [c.f table I], the PDF P (Σ||R|), P (q||R|) exhibits
signiﬁcant diﬀerences among diﬀerent groups of |R|. This
is because rarely occurring large |R| causes large ﬂuctua-
tions but does not signiﬁcantly contribute to correlation.
In contrast other quantities such as σ and N show there
is not so much of a diﬀerence. Fig.5(d) again shows the
same eﬀect as seen in Fig.4(b) where large ﬂuctuations
decrease the number of transactions within a speciﬁed
time interval.

In conclusion it can be inferred that the “two-phase be-
havior” as reported in [1] gives no evidence as to whether
critical phenomena exist in the ﬁnancial market or not.
The observed out of equilibrium phase is a feature of
the power law PDF of the share volume. The absolute
value of price ﬂuctuation causes a large ﬂuctuation in the
share volume, and large ﬂuctuation of the absolute price
causes a decrease in the number of trades in a speciﬁed

We model the dynamics of social structure by a simple interacting particle system. The social
standing of an individual agent is represented by an integer-valued ﬁtness that changes via two
oﬀsetting processes. When two agents interact one advances: the ﬁtter with probability p and the
less ﬁt with probability 1 − p. The ﬁtness of an agent may also decline with rate r. From a scaling
analysis of the underlying master equations for the ﬁtness distribution of the population, we ﬁnd
four distinct social structures as a function of the governing parameters p and r. These include: (i)
a static lower-class society where all agents have ﬁnite ﬁtness; (ii) an upwardly-mobile middle-class
society; (iii) a hierarchical society where a ﬁnite fraction of the population belongs to a middle class
and a complementary fraction to the lower class; (iv) an egalitarian society where all agents are
upwardly mobile and have nearly the same ﬁtness. We determine the basic features of the ﬁtness
distributions in these four phases.

INTRODUCTION

The emergence of class structure in society is a ubiq-
uitous phenomenon in the biological and the social sci-
ences [1, 2, 3, 4]. Social hierarchies have been widely ob-
served in animal populations including insects [5], mam-
mals [6, 7, 8], and primates [9], as well as human com-
munities [10].

The possibility of quantitative modeling of social phe-
nomena using concepts and techniques borrowed from
the physical sciences is rapidly gaining appreciation. Ex-
amples of such modeling include the wealth distribution
[11, 12], opinion dynamics [13, 14, 15], and rumor propa-
gation [16, 17]. Such approaches typically draw analogies
between individual agents in the social system and par-
ticles in a corresponding physical system and then iden-
tifying macroscopically observed phenomena with micro-
scopic agent-agent interactions [18, 19, 20].

In this spirit, we seek to tie the emergence of social
structures to speciﬁc interactions between agents within a
general version of the recently-introduced advancement-
decline process [21, 22, 23].
In our model, the social
standing of each agent is characterized by a single num-
ber, its ﬁtness. Agents increase their ﬁtness by interact-
ing with other agents and also, their ﬁtness may decline
spontaneously. This simple model has only two parame-
ters: the probability that the ﬁtter agent advances in an
interaction and the rate of decline.

We ﬁnd that a rich variety of familiar social structures
emerges as a result of the competition between advance-
ment and decline. When decline dominates, the society
is static and the ﬁtness distribution approaches a steady

state. When the decline rate is comparable to the ad-
vancement rate, the society is dynamic and the charac-
teristic ﬁtness of the population increases linearly with
time. In this case, there are several possibilities. When
the less ﬁt agent beneﬁts from social interactions, an egal-
itarian society arises in which all agents advance at the
same rate. Consequently, inequalities among agents are
small. On the other hand, when the ﬁtter agent tends to
beneﬁt in competitions, agents advance at diﬀerent rates
and social inequalities increase with time. Depending on
the relative inﬂuence of advancement and decline, either
the entire population or only a fraction of it may be up-
wardly mobile. In the latter case, the society consists of
a static lower class and an upwardly-mobile middle class.
In Section II, we introduce the general advancement-
decline process and the governing master equations. The
overall class structure and the statistics of the mobile
middle class are obtained using scaling analysis in Sec-
tion III. The basic features of the egalitarian society are
investigated in section IV, where the cumulative ﬁtness
distribution may be largely determined by linear trav-
eling wave analysis. In Section V, the statistics of the
lower class, where the ﬁtness distribution is steady, are
determined. We conclude in section VI.

II. THE ADVANCEMENT-DECLINE MODEL

We model a scenario in which the social status of an
agent beneﬁts from increased social interactions, while
solitude or isolation have the opposite eﬀect.
Indeed,
highly connected individuals often have better access to
information, resources, and power, that are often gained
as a result of social interactions. Thus, in our model there
are two competing evolutionary processes that inﬂuence
the ﬁtness of agents: (i) advancement via social inter-
actions, and (ii) decline due to the lack of interactions
(Fig. 1). For simplicity, social standing is represented by

(i) Advancement. Agents interact in pairs, and as a re-
sult of the interaction, only one advances. There are two
possibilities: either the ﬁtter agent advances or the less
ﬁt advances. We allow the ﬁtter agent to advance with
probability p and the less ﬁt agent to advance with prob-
ability 1
p. Thus, when two agents with ﬁtness k and
ﬁtness j interact (with k > j), the outcome is

−

(k + 1, j) with probability p,
(k, j + 1) with probability 1

p.

−

For p = 1 the ﬁtter agent always advances [23], while for
p = 0 the less ﬁt agent always advances. The interac-
tion rules are deﬁned so that one randomly-chosen agent
advances when two equally-ﬁt agents interact. Without
loss of generality, the interaction rate is set to 1/2. Also,
we consider the thermodynamic limit where the number
of agents is inﬁnite.

(ii) Decline. In the decline step, the ﬁtness of an indi-
vidual decreases according to

k

with rate r. This process reﬂects a natural tendency for
ﬁtness to decrease in the absence of social activity. We
impose the lower limit for ﬁtness to be k = 0; once an
individual reaches zero ﬁtness, there is no further decline.
Our goal is to understand how the ﬁtness distribution
of a population evolves as a function of the two model pa-
rameters, the advancement probability p and the decline
rate r. Let fk(t) be the fraction of agents with ﬁtness
k at time t. In the mean-ﬁeld limit, where any pair of
agents is equally likely to interact, the ﬁtness distribution

than k and ﬁtness greater than k. The boundary condi-
tion is f−1(t) = 0. The ﬁrst pair of terms accounts for
decline, the second pair of terms describes interactions
where the stronger agent advances, and the third pair of
terms accounts for interactions where the weaker agent
advances. The last pair of terms describes interactions
between two equal agents and it reﬂects that when two
such agents interact, only one of them advances. The
prefactor 1/2 arises because there are half as many ways
to chose equal agents as there are for diﬀerent agents.
We consider the initial condition where all agents have
the minimal ﬁtness fk(0) = δk,0.

It proves useful to rewrite the evolution equation in
a closed form that involves only the cumulative distri-
bution. Summing the rate equations (1) and using the

This result can be derived directly by summing the mas-
ter equations (1) or even simpler, from the deﬁnition
of the advancement-decline process. The ﬁrst term ac-
counts for advancement, where interactions occur with
rate 1/2 such that each interaction advances only one
agent. The second term stems from decline and reﬂects
the fact that all agents except for the least-ﬁt ones decline
with rate r.

We now discuss the basic social structures that emerge

from the solution to the master equation.

for the linear scaling function (9) to apply. First, the cu-

only when its slope is positive, that is, when p > 1/2.

This behavior describes a middle class society where all
agents are upwardly mobile, as their ﬁtness improves lin-
early with time. In this case, social inequalities also in-

2. Hierarchical Society: Along the line r + p = 1, the
ﬁtness of the poorest agents vanishes. Moreover, the lin-
ear scaling solution (9) has a ﬁnite positive value at zero
ﬁtness for a range of parameter values p and r. These
two observations suggest the existence of another type

In this egalitarian society, all agents have the same scaled

Thus, we ﬁnd a hierarchical society (Fig. 2) that includes

class. The lower class consists of a ﬁnite fraction

of agents with zero ﬁtness (in scaled units). In section V,
we examine the lower class more closely and show that
its ﬁtness distribution is time-independent and extends
only over a ﬁnite range.

3. Lower-Class Society: When the fraction L of agents
with zero ﬁtness reaches 1, the entire population is poor.
For p > 1/2, the condition L = 1 occurs on the boundary
p = r. At this point the ﬁtness distribution becomes a
step function,

ΦL(x) = Θ(x),

0 and Θ(x) = 1 for x > 0. We
with Θ(x) = 0 for x
therefore conclude that there is a region of the phase di-
agram where the scaled ﬁtness of the entire population is
zero. For any initial state, the ﬁtness distribution quickly
approaches the step-function in a lower-class society.

4. Egalitarian Society: There is another region of the
phase diagram where the ﬁtness distribution also be-
comes a step function. When p = 1/2 and r < 1/2,

then both x+ and x− are equal to 1/2

function must change in a continuous fashion, we con-

In section IV, we show that in this society, the ﬁtness dif-
ferences between agents are small and do not grow with
time. This is the sense in which the society is egalitarian.
When p < 1/2, the weaker agent preferentially beneﬁts
in an interaction, so that the rich eﬀectively supports the
poor. We also note that the lower class and the egalitar-
ian society share one common feature: they do not have
a middle class. The boundary between these two phases,
determined by the condition v = 0, is the line r = 1/2
(Fig. 2).

Our numerical integration of the evolution equations
conﬁrms the overall picture of four diﬀerent social struc-
tures (Fig. 2): a middle class society (Fig. 3), a hierarchi-
cal society (Fig. 4), a lower-class society as in (14), and
an egalitarian society as in (15). The numerical data was

iﬁed accuracy of 10−10 in the distribution Fk.

B. Reﬁnements to the Scaling Solutions

Our numerical results for the cumulative distribution
Fk, when plotted versus the scaling variable x = k/t,
smoothly approaches the appropriate expressions for the
piecewise linear scaling function Φ(x) derived in the pre-
vious subsection (Figs. 3 & 4). As time increases, the
ﬁtness distribution narrows. The simulations also show
that the approach to the scaling solution is slowest in the
vicinity of the extremes of the middle class x = x− and
x = x+ (with x− = 0 for the hierarchical phase).

The correction to scaling near these extrema can be
determined by keeping derivatives up to second order in
the continuum limit of the master equation. This approx-
imation gives the nonlinear diﬀusion equation [25, 26]

lative distribution.

For the middle-class society, we therefore conclude that
the bottom of the middle class has a Gaussian tail, with
the center of the Gaussian located at k− = v−t and with
width
D−t. The same analysis can be carried out for
the hierarchical society, where the quantity F
L now
satisﬁes the diﬀusion equation with zero velocity v− = 0
and diﬀusivity D− = r. Conversely, the distribution for
the top end of the middle class can be obtained by ana-
F . It is immediate to show that this quantity
lyzing 1
again obeys Eq. (18) with velocity v+ = x+ = p
r
and diﬀusivity D+ = (r + p)/2. We conclude that the
extremes of the middle class are characterized by Gaus-
sian tails whose extents grow diﬀusively with time.
In
terms of the scaling variable x, the deviation from the
scaling function Φ(x) is appreciable only within a region
of whose width is shrinking as t−1/2.

For the special case p = 1/2, the nonlinear terms van-
ish and the ﬁtness distribution is described exactly by the
linear convection-diﬀusion equation (18) with drift veloc-
ity v = 1/2
r and diﬀusion coeﬃcient D = (r + p)/2
(the nonlinear term is negligible). Thus there is a drift
toward smaller ﬁtness for r > 1/2 and the ﬁtness dis-
tribution approaches a steady-state proﬁle that decays
exponentially with ﬁtness. In the opposite case of v > 0,
the ﬁtness distribution is simply a Gaussian that drifts
to larger ﬁtness with velocity 1
r and whose width is
proportional to √Dt. In the case of p = 1/2, the rela-
tive position of an agent in the society is irrelevant and
advancement reduces to a pure random walk [27].

We conclude that the likelihood of having agents that
are much richer or much poorer than the average ﬁtness
k = vt in the egalitarian society is exponentially small,
as illustrated in Fig. 6. The society therefore consists of
agents whose ﬁtnesses are all roughly the same, k
vt.
As one might naturally anticipate, social inequalities are
small under the dynamics in which the rich preferentially
gives to the poor.

B. Less ﬁt advances (p = 0)

For the case where the less ﬁt agent always advances,
the ﬁtness distribution has a special form. In this case,
the complementary cumulative distribution obeys

We expect that the ﬁtness distribution will continue to
have the form of a propagating wave. Substituting the

. The constants C and v should be determined
as z
numerically. Hence, the front of the traveling wave is
extremely sharp. This tail characterizes statistics of the
rich, so when the rich never beneﬁts from interactions
with the poor, rich agents are ultra-rare (Fig. 7). Even
though the leading tail extends to only a handful of sites,
it is still possible to verify the super-exponential decay
(27). In contrast, the z
tail that characterizes the
poor is not altered; it has the same exponential tail as in
Eq. (21).

V. THE LOWER CLASS

We now determine the ﬁtness distribution of poorest
agents, a class that exists in both the hierarchical and
lower-class societies. As we shall now show, the ﬁtness
distribution of the lower class in the limit of small but
non-zero ﬁtness approaches a steady state. For the case
of the hierarchical society, we write Fk = L(1
gk), where
L is the lower-class fraction, with the deviation gk van-
ishing for large k. Substituting this form into the master
equation (3) and setting the time derivative to zero, gives

In the lower-class society, the ﬁtness is conﬁned to a very
small range. Notice also that this exponential decay co-
incides with the traveling wave solution (23) with v set
equal to zero, as the decay function is now e−β = p/r.

Finally, we consider the hierarchical society. Using (13)

Thus, for the hierarchical society, the ﬁtness distribution
has a power-law large-ﬁtness tail in the lower class region
(see also [23] for more details).

As discussed in section III, there is a diﬀusive boundary
layer that separates the steady-state ﬁtness distribution
in the lower class and time dependent ﬁtness distribution
in the middle class. From Eqs. (6) and (12), the ﬁtness

Thus, the steady-state region extends over a ﬁtness range

equation for the underlying ﬁtness distribution, we ob-
tain three types of classes: a static lower class, a mobile
but disperse middle class, and a mobile but “condensed”
egalitarian class. The population as a whole organizes
into four types of societies, three of which consist of one
of these classes, and a hierarchical society in which the
lower class and the middle class coexist. Two parame-
ters, the rate of decline and the advancement probability,
quantify the competition between advancement and de-
cline. The overall social organization is determined solely
by these two parameters.

The ﬁtness distribution has a very diﬀerent charac-
ter in each of the classes.
In the lower class, this ﬁt-
ness distribution approaches a steady state. In the mid-
dle class, the distribution is self-similar in time and cor-
respondingly the characteristic ﬁtness increases linearly
with time. Although agents are upwardly mobile, the
disparities between agents in the middle class also grows
indeﬁnitely. In the egalitarian class, the ﬁtness distribu-
tion follows a traveling wave, so that all agents constantly
advance, but ﬁtness diﬀerences between agents remains
small.

Much of the richness of the phenomenology is due to
the fact that the mechanisms for advancement and de-
cline are fundamentally diﬀerent. One requires interac-
tion between agents, while the other is a single-agent pro-
cess. This dichotomy is reﬂected by the master equation
where the decline terms are linear but the advancement
terms are nonlinear. As a result, there is no detailed bal-
ance and the dynamics are non-equilibrium in character.

It should be interesting to use the advancement-decline
model to analyze real-world data. One natural applica-
tion is to wealth and income distributions of individuals,
where both power-law and exponential behavior has been
observed [11, 12]. A related issue is the wealth of na-
tions. It is well documented that the wealth distribution
of countries is extremely inequitable, with 60% of the
world’s population producing just 5.6% of the planet’s
gross domestic product (GDP), another 20% producing
11.7%, and the remaining 20% of the population produc-
ing 82.7% of the GDP [29]. The existence of such a large
underclass corresponds to a large decline rate in our di-
versity model and it may be worthwhile to understand
the social mechanisms for such a large decline. Another
possibility is sports statistics where the winning percent-
age distribution of teams plays the role of the ﬁtness dis-
tribution [30].

tween advancement and decline leads to a rich and real-
